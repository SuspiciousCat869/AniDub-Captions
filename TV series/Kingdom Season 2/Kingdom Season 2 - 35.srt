[NARRATOR] In the wake of his
success in the war with Wei,

2
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,625
Xin was made a
1,000-man commander.

3
00:01:43,708 --> 00:01:46,750
But the Fei Xin Force kept
losing their front-line battles

4
00:01:46,833 --> 00:01:49,000
guarding Qin's new territory,

5
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:51,458
and soon, Xin was
in danger of losing

his newly assigned higher rank.

7
00:01:53,958 --> 00:01:56,625
Upon learning the problem
lay in their strategies,

8
00:01:56,708 --> 00:02:00,291
Meng Tian called in a tactician
from the capital Xianyang:

9

10
00:02:02,416 --> 00:02:04,125
Or so he thought!

a visit instead was...

it would still be a long time

before I'd be coming
to you like this,

surprised myself.

00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:21,791
That Tian Yong is serious!

161
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:23,541
She's gonna cry!

162
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:25,583
That poor thing!

163
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:29,541
You jerk!

164
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:31,041
What--?

165
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:34,958
What did you...

166
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:38,000
What did you call me?!

167
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:39,750
I know any new tactician

168
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:42,416
is bound to encounter
some resentment.

169
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,708
But right now is just not
the time or place at all!

[FEI XIN SOLDIERS,
QU HAI, WEI PING gasp]

171
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:50,833
[DIAO] Do you have a remote
idea of just how important

172
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:52,708
this area is for Shanyang?

173
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:55,500
That's why I'm here, but if
you keep going as you were,

174
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:57,625
there'll be no going back!

175
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:03,791
[TIAN YONG] Get out of here,
you mouthy brat!

176
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:05,500
[XIN]
That's enough, Tian Yong!

177
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:06,458
But I was--

178
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:08,666
[XIN]
I'll do the talking!

[TIAN YONG grunts]

180
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,833
[XIN] Diao, I know
you were serious

181
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:15,583
about becoming a tactician,

182
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:17,875
studying it and all.

183
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:20,916
[XIN]
Truth is, though,

184
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,291
I don't know for sure what
you're truly capable of yet.

185
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:28,416
So you can't just go
ordering the squad around

186
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,041
like you were doing
just a second ago.

187
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:32,625
Okay?

188
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:34,625
I'll let you come with us
to the main camp

189

but we'll run things
the same as always.

Yeah, I got it. Sure, Xin.

[DIAO sighs]

194
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:58,291

[DIAO]
Yes, Yi.

199
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:06,666
Now, then.

200
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,500
Oh, here, I will do it.

201
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:10,291

Come on, scooch.

00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:13,625
Hang in there, buddy.

204
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:15,083
Huh?

205
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:17,041
I learned from
Lieutenant Qiang Lei,

206
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:20,166
that male or female
doesn't matter out here.

207
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:23,166
[DIAO]
Hm.

208
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,333
And also...

209
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:27,083
Huh?

210
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:28,291
[YI]
Never mind.

211
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:29,750
What was it?

212
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:31,041
[YI]
My wife back home,

213
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:33,333
you look a little like her
when she was young.

214
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:34,875
[DIAO]
Huh?!

215
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:38,500
[YI] Or maybe my daughter,
given your age.

216
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:40,041
Both are real cute.

217
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:41,833
Oh, come on, now.

218
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:45,875
[YI laughs] Just, you know,
do your very best.

219

[FEI XIN MESSENGER A] Report!
Tian Yong's unit is struggling!

222
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,750
Say what?

223
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:10,125
[FEI XIN MESSENGER A]
They need reinforcements!

224
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:11,791
[XIN]
Got it!

225
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:15,208
[FEI XIN MESSENGER B] The same
goes for Long YRu's unit, too!

226
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:18,583
Send out Wei Ping's and
Ze Gui's units on the double!

227
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:19,625
Sir!

228
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:20,541
[DIAO]
Wait up!

229
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:21,541
[XIN gasps]

230
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:23,583
Those two units
do not need help.

231
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:25,416
What are you talking about?

232
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,833
I mean that they are in
places they can afford to leave.

233
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:30,500
If they're struggling,
they should flee

234
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,416
to the underbrush at
the rear and regroup.

235
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,541
I'm far more
concerned about

236
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:39,500
Pei Lang's, Chong Yuan's,
and Tian YRu's posts, you see.

237
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:41,166
[YUAN, XIN gasp]

238
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,500
[DIAO] If this spot falls
to Wei, it'll cut off

239
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:47,125
lines of communication
to our units nearby.

240
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:49,500
And once the enemy
notices all this,

241
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:51,708
they'll come at us really hard.

242
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:54,958
It would be better to send
the reinforcements over there.

243
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:57,500
[YUAN]
To Pei Lang and the other two?

244
00:12:57,583 --> 00:13:00,500
But, we've heard
nothing from them.

Eh?

00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:05,791
You promised earlier that
you would keep out of this!

251
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,000
What do you mean "what"?

252
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,375
We do what I said!

253
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:16,875
Send reinforcements to
Tian Yong and Long YRu!

[NARRATOR] However, Xin's
strategy backfired once again.

256
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:25,458
Just as Diao predicted,

257
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:27,458
the enemy had stationed
several troops

258
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:30,208
near the other three commanders.

259
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:31,458
What might!

260
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:34,333
When did the Wei army
get this strong?

261
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:36,625
They're definitely
on a whole other level

262
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:40,083
than the soldiers
we fought before!

Hurry up, or the scattered

00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:25,958
[NARRATOR]
In response,

321
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:29,416
Bing Gui had laid out
a large-scale dragnet.

322
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:32,041
[NARRATOR]
However,

323
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:34,500
by the time the
dragnet was in place,

324
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:37,958
Diao and the squad had already
fled to its far side.

325
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:40,083
[laughs]

326
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:43,791
--[FEI XIN FORCE cheers]
--We did it, Diao!

327
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:46,291
[DIAO]
We haven't done anything yet.

328
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:49,416
This is where it gets serious.

329
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,750
We move the main camp
to the hill ahead!

330
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:54,166
Show me the map!

331
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,250
I'll mark where the
scattered units are!

332
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:57,166
Go find them!

333
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,666
[FEI XIN FORCE yells]

334
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:01,875
[MENG TIAN]
A girl?

335
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:03,541
[MENG YI]
Yes.

336
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:05,416
[MENG TIAN]
Huh?

337
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,625
[MENG YI] I'm not standing up
for her or anything,

338
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:12,791
but gender is not much
of an issue for a tactician.

339
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:15,541
Well, I suppose.

340
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:17,916
As long as this works.

341
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,625
That much I can pledge.

342
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:22,458
What I mean is,

343
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:26,833
she's received our teacher's
special tactician's permit.

344
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:28,541
[MENG TIAN]
From your teacher?

345
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:31,500
The first early permit
since you, brother.

346
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:34,041
I'm the only one at
school who can match her

347
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:37,333
at tabletop tactics,
I will have you know.

348
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:39,541
Well, all right, then.

349
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:43,416
[MENG TIAN]
Then all that's left...

350
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,958
...is her aptitude for
the tactician position.

351
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:48,583
[gasps]

352
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:50,208
[MENG TIAN]
Without it,

353
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:54,541
no amount of talent will ever
let her shine as a tactician.

354
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:55,708
[MENG YI]
It turns out,

355
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:58,416
He Liao Diao has already
experienced battle

356
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,166
which is a plus.

357
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,333
[MENG TIAN]
Hm.

358
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:03,541
But still, though.

359
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:06,041
We won't know for sure

360
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:09,083
until we see how
it all turns out.

361
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:12,125
[QING]
Hey, there they are!

362
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:14,833
I got Tian Yong's
unit right here!

363
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:18,166
[QU HAI] You guys are
all right too, I see!

364
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:19,791
[laughs]

365
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:22,583
Pretty gutsy of you to
move the main camp, then!

366
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:25,291
Guess even Xin has
his good days, huh?

367
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:26,666
[QU HAI]
It wasn't Xin.

368
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,125
Huh?

369
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:31,291
[QU HAI] This is all courtesy
of the girl tactician.

370
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:33,125
What? Seriously?

371
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:36,916
[LONG YQU]
You're not the only ones.

372
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,291
She found us as well,

373
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:41,500
completely cut off and
wandering around aimlessly.

374
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:43,416
Yeah, and us too.

375
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,166
Us as well.

376
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:48,458
[PEI LANG] She figured out where
all the scattered units were

377
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:51,500
and gathered us
together on insight alone.

378
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:55,500
Looks like that brat's
no ordinary girl, after all.

379
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:59,250
[DIAO gasps]

380
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:00,541
[DIAO]
They're here!

381
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:02,208
[MENG YI]
A tactician's aptitude

382
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:05,291
is always tested in
their first battle.

383
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:07,166
Aptitude?

384
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:10,250
Because we're still
only theoretical tacticians.

385
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:14,208
We don't know the terror
in going to the battlefield.

386
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:16,875
If you don't kill these guys,
the enemy will close in,

387
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:19,291
can you stay calm?

388
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:21,458
How about when...

389
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:25,041
...you have to set two
people up to kill one another?

390
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:26,458
[DIAO gasps]

391
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:29,250
[MENG YI] The pieces we handle
so casually every day,

392
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:34,708
represent the lives of hundreds
of real live human beings.

393
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:39,083
The terror of war's greater
than you can imagine.

394
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:42,541
Plenty of budding tacticians
got swallowed up in that

395
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:45,958
and were crushed,
totally helpless.

396
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:54,833
[XIN]
Diao! The enemy is here!

397
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:56,875
D-Diao?

398
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:59,291
[DIAO] After experiencing
several battles,

399
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:02,750
I thought I knew
what it was like.

400
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:06,166
But I was wrong.

401
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:09,833
The heat and the bloodlust
carried on the wind!

402
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:13,875
It's never felt this
insanely oppressive before.

403
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:15,750
I get it now.

404
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:25,291
[DIAO] This is what it's
like on the battlefield!

405
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:34,750
[DIAO] And the battle
hasn't even started yet!

406
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:37,083
I won't get swallowed up!

407
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:40,416
Hey there, Diao!

408
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,791
Oh, I know!

409
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:44,333
Here we go!
Get into position!

410
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:46,416
[FEI XIN SOLDIERS grunt]

411
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,958
[DIAO] I'll swallow up
the battlefield, instead.

412
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:53,708
Huh?

413
00:20:56,708 --> 00:21:00,750
[JIAN YONG laughs]
So now they are on the move!

414
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:02,583
Dao Qing's to the front!

415
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:03,541
[WEI SOLDIER D]
Yes, sir!

416
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:06,166
Dao Qing? Are you sure?

417
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,958
He's got 1,000
elite troops with him!

418
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:11,291
It'll be done soon!

419
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:14,583
Well then, so be it.

420
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:17,583
Dao Qing's unit!
We're taking point now!

421
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:19,083
Consider it an honor!

422
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:20,875
[WEI SOLDIERS yell]

423
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:24,625
[BING GUI] The Fei Xin Force's
main unit escaped the dragnet

424
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:26,166
before we could close in.

425
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:29,666
Then, they joined up
with their scattered troops.

426
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:32,250
Regrouping so quickly.

427
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:36,875
Clearly, they must have gotten
some brains on board, finally.

428
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:38,375
Let us go!

429
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:40,708
[WEI SOLDIERS yell]

430
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:42,666
[BING GUI]
This one move will show me

431
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:46,375
just what their
tactician's made of!

432
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:47,416
[DIAO grunts]

433
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,791
They're here!
The enemy vanguard!

434
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:54,583
Eight hundred, maybe 1,000
with about 200 cavalry!

435
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:58,208
Oh, I'm Tian Xiao,
your faithful adjutant now.

436
00:21:58,291 --> 00:21:59,708
[DIAO]
Yes, hello, Tian Xiao.

437
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:02,666
It's 300 cavalry
and 700 infantry.

438
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,041
[TIAN XIAO]
Yes ma'am!

439
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:06,000
[DIAO]
Out of all 4,000 troops,

440
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:08,291
a quarter of them are
now on the move.

441
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:12,041
And an elite force at that!

442
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:14,083
They definitely don't
want this over,

443
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:17,166
they're clearly trying
to see how we react.

444
00:22:20,458 --> 00:22:23,750
[DIAO] They mean to
directly gauge my ability!

445
00:22:28,375 --> 00:22:30,500
[DIAO]
This is perfect!

446
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:31,500
[TIAN XIAO gasps]

447
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:33,791
All troops stand by,
right now!

448
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:34,791
[XIN]
Huh?

449
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:37,458
So we're not going
anywhere then?

450
00:22:37,541 --> 00:22:40,666
[DIAO] Suddenly,
it's 1,000 versus 1,000.

451
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:43,958
But if we lose too much
manpower right here,

452
00:22:44,041 --> 00:22:47,708
we won't be able to
fight their other 3,000.

453
00:22:47,791 --> 00:22:50,000
We have to factor
that into our tactics

454
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:52,375
and defeat them efficiently.

455
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:53,916
[TIAN XIAO]
He Liao Diao!

456
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,583
If we don't intercept
the enemy, they will--

457
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:56,625
No mind!

458
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:58,458
[TIAN XIAO gasps]

459
00:22:58,541 --> 00:23:01,208
[DIAO] They can't tell
from over there...

460
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,333
[DIAO] ...that the Wei army
has lots of branching paths

461
00:23:07,416 --> 00:23:08,958
on their way!

462
00:23:10,375 --> 00:23:13,041
This is where we will...

463
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:16,291
Bury their 1,000-man
vanguard, let's go!
