00:01:38,208 --> 00:01:39,708
[NARRATOR] In the middle
of a fierce battle

2
00:01:39,791 --> 00:01:41,916
between Qin and Wei,
they meet again:

3
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,291
Xin and Lun Hu.

4
00:01:44,375 --> 00:01:46,541
Which of them will be
able to overcome his limits

5
00:01:46,625 --> 00:01:48,750
and have his own way
in the end?

6
00:01:49,458 --> 00:01:50,625
[NARRATOR]
The blistering-hot emotions

7
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:53,291
truly are making sparks fly!

8
00:01:58,041 --> 00:01:59,375
[LUN HU] Do you understand
the significance

9
00:01:59,458 --> 00:02:03,958
of this undertaking,
Xin of the Fei Xin Force?

10
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:08,125
If you fall, the Qin army
here will be destroyed,

11
00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:11,416
and we will rush off to
kill Meng Ao promptly.

12
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,000
Keep babbling!

13
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:18,166
If I take you down right now,
we win the whole central battle!

00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:26,208

You... rat!

[CHU SHUI]
Uh-oh!

22
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,666
In an unstable fight
on horseback,

23
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,875
You must grab on
with your legs!

24
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:14,708
[CHU SHUI]
Otherwise,

25
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:17,541
he'll never be able
to stop Lun Hu's blade!

This comes after he
stopped that full-bodied blow.

37
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:24,500
If this turns into a
ground battle now

38
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:26,958
with that badly-wounded leg
he just injured...

39
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:30,333
[CHU SHUI] No!

40
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:33,000
Come on, Xin, Sir,
don't stand down!

41
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:34,541
You have a battle to fight.

[LUN HU]
Honestly.

44
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,750
You have real guts, it's true.

45
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:52,250
You saw you were at a
loss on horseback,

46
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:55,833
so you risked going into a fight
on the ground instead of that?

[grunts]

48
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:02,250
That was most definitely a
very good call on your part.

49
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:05,125
For if you'd gone on
just like that,

50
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:08,500
the fight would've been
over really quickly.

51
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:14,375
[LUN HU] Not that it changes
my overwhelming advantage

52
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:16,916
over you in any way, truthfully.

[grunts]

00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:22,666

even stand on that leg,

hard with only one healthy leg?

of times that way!

So tenacious.

00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:31,958
What is it then,

67
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:36,666
this unusually resilient
spirit that he possesses?

68
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:40,875
What exactly has been
sustaining him all this time?

00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:48,041
What's going on?

70

Did something happen at the
main camp, or what?

I apologize, my lord,

72
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,541
and ask your patience.

[MENG AO] Send in the

You must gather up
absolutely every soldier

79
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,291
that's near the trap!

This is the moment where we
finally end it and win, men!

81

[MENG AO]
Take him out!

Where exactly is

We must all protect him,
no matter what, men!

It's no use;
now we can't even move!

If we could withstand
these arrows--

All troops, you must go
underneath right away!

They have just
hidden under the corpses!

So bring out the

Where is Lian Po?

Well then, men?
Did we get Lian Po or not?

for sure, not in this rubble.

Keep shooting!
Until no one's moving,

trick, so just don't stop!

No, it can't be!

[ZHU KE] The soldiers
that were posted to the traps

113
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:34,375
have all been shoved
off the cliff!

114
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:37,250
[MA LING]
What on earth is going on?!

115
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:40,250
How exactly did Lian Po
wind up on the cliff-top?

116
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:42,416
But I thought that he
was stuck in that trap,

117
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,666
attacked by a load of arrows!

118
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,583
[MENG AO]
No, he wasn't.

119
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:50,208
[MENG AO]
We saw enemy flags in the trap

120
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:53,875
and merely assumed Lian Po was
down there with everybody else

121
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:55,625
trapped in the pit as well.

122
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:57,958
However, there may
have been blind spots

123
00:09:58,041 --> 00:10:00,208
along the path to the
trap as we saw it,

124
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:02,125
unfortunately for us, that is.

125
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:06,375
Lian Po quite cleverly
divided his troops into two

126
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:09,083
and led his half down
a completely different path

127
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:12,708
from the one we've had
before us, you see.

128
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:17,208
And then, afterwards,
just before he reached the trap

129
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:20,625
he must have headed straight
for the very top, I think.

130
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:23,625
Lian Po has even managed
to somehow figure out

131
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:25,958
this fortress' ace in the hole.

132
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:28,916
[LIAN PO snarls]

133
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,166
[MENG AO]
My elaborate scheme

134
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,291
has failed terribly!

[screaming]

136
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:41,333
Well done, my lord. Truly.

137
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:44,041
I honestly did have my doubts.

138
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:49,583
[LIAN PO] Once I got a very good
look at the fortress maze here,

139
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:53,375
I figured it'd come into
play in the scheme somehow.

140
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:56,500
However, to reshape
routes and then trap your foe

141
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:58,666
right after he had
entered your maze,

142
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,125
you need an eye for predicting
your enemies' movements

143
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:04,958
and a precise military eye
to be able to judge when exactly

144
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:09,041
you ought to put your
men into motion.

145
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:12,666
I wasn't sure that
mediocre Meng Ao up there,

146
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,458
would really put such
a bothersome and incredibly

147
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:18,875
complicated plan
into actual action.

148
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:22,250
But just in case, I came up
with a way to deal with spots

149
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:25,250
that were more
likely to be traps.

150
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:28,541
You see how that
turned out?

151
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:30,083
Meng Ao...

152
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:33,708
He used his grudge against me
for all those past defeats,

153
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:37,208
and did some careful
preparation, indeed.

154
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:39,875
This truly is a
mighty fine fortress

155
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:42,375
that he built over here.

156
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:44,791
However,

157
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:48,125
it would quite honestly
take far more than 40 years

158
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:51,916
of hard planning to get even
one elaborate scheme over me,

00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:16,791
He may have escaped the trap,
but he should still be stuck

164
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:18,708
in the maze!

165
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:20,708
Once again, he has
managed to use

166
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:22,750
my strategy against me, here.

167
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:24,125
[gasping]

168
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:26,500
In shifting the maze around
in order to lure Lian Po

169
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:29,500
into an elaborate trap,
several other paths

170
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:32,791
came to lead directly to us
over here, you see.

171
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:34,208
[gasping]

172
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:37,583
Furthermore, focusing our
manpower around the traps.

173
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:40,625
to be able to strike
at the enemy in one fell swoop

174
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:44,166
in turn left us with some
very poorly defended areas.

175
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:50,291
[MENG AO]
And so, most likely.

176
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:53,708
that's where Lian Po
is headed right now!

177
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:55,291
[LIAN PO]
I'm now on my way up

178
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:59,208
just to be able to
see you, Meng Ao.

179
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:03,833
I can't possibly leave Lun Hu
waiting around, after all!

180
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:17,208

[LIAN PO yells]

186
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:40,625
[LI CHONG]
There's no stopping him.

187
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:43,708
Because he's already almost
here, as you can clearly see!

188
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:44,625
[MA GONG]
My lord!

189
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:46,250
[MA LING]
Lian Po is coming!

190
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:50,125
Come on, don't fret, he's
only almost here, after all.

191
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:53,041
There's still plenty of mountain
between him and the top,

192
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:55,125
as you all well know.

193
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,625
[MENG AO] And there's
absolutely no maze or the like

194
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:01,625
that's this high up, either.

195
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,791
All we can do is
go back to basics:

196
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:07,750
put together a
garrison unit and defend.

197
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:10,250
You see, with no tricks
left in his way,

198
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:13,083
Lian Po will be forced to
battle us head on.

199
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:15,500
He will have no other choice
but to take out

200
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:18,666
every last garrison on his
way up over here.

201
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:21,791
But, my lord...
Still, we must act.

202
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:23,625
[MA GONG]
With Lian Po's momentum,

203
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:26,458
it's only a matter of time
before he arrives!

204
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:33,416
So, it's just a matter of
time, then, is it?

205
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,708
That's excellent!

206
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,416
[gasping]

207
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,458
Because that
strategy right there

208
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:42,750
is the fighting style of the
old-school Meng Ao's army!

209
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:43,833
[gasping]

210
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:46,791
Just think it over
calmly right now.

211
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:49,166
When you break it down,
this Meng Ao army

212
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:50,708
consists of three armies

213
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:52,958
led by me and my
two lieutenants.

214
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:54,625
Each of these divisions

215
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:57,875
has a very clear and
simple role to play.

216
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:01,458
Our main army defends arduously,
keeping me, the general,

217
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:03,833
from being killed.

218
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:06,541
In the meantime,
one of the lieutenants' armies

219
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:09,875
naturally goes right after
the enemy general.

220
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:12,625
That's the same strategy
I've always used

221
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:15,166
to lead us to victory
over the years!

222
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:19,583
However, Wang Jian is holed up
in the rear fortress my lord,

223
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:23,583
and unfortunately somehow, Huan
Yi is still nowhere to be found!

224
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:27,291
If we, his allies, have lost
sight of Huan Yi at the moment,

225
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:31,375
then without a shadow of a
doubt, so too have our enemies.

226
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:32,916
It can't be.

227
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:37,708
[MENG AO] My battle lies in
trusting that "It can't be"

228
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:39,958
and keeping it alive,
you understand?

[WANG BEN grunts]

destroy them at this rate!

232
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:07,041
But my lord, the battle--

233
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:09,125
I will handle things here!

If we step in there right now,

that means Xin needed
his men to help him
