15

He's a rather shrewd man

SUBARU: Some people calling
themselves the Witch's Cult

31
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:35,041
plan to attack Roswaal's domain
in three days.

32
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:38,375
I want to ask for your help
in stopping them.

33
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:39,750
- Interesting.

It would appear

- It seems so. Of course,

36
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:45,333
from the very first moment
we saw Miss Emilia,

37
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:47,041
a half-elf, entering the scene,
this household predicted

38
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:50,416
that something like this
was bound to happen.

39
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,166
CRUSCH:
I understand the situation.

40
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,875
My next question is why
you chose me to assist you.

41
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:56,750
- Because,
to be completely honest,

42
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:59,166
you seem the most likely
to help right now.

43
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,375
Since that council meeting,
you've helped me and Rem--

44
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:03,666
- Don't misunderstand.
I only aided you two

45
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,416
because I was contracted
to do so.

46
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,583
If you wish to negotiate,
you need to show me

47
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:09,416
what I stand to gain
by getting involved.

48
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,708
There's nothing further
to discuss otherwise.

49
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,250
If, with my assistance,

50
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:15,625
you can eliminate the
threat
posed by the Witch's
Cult,

51
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:18,250
what would my profit be?
What would I stand to gain

52
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:21,416
by intervening
in this affair at all?

53
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,583
- If you agree to help me out
with this problem,

54
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:25,541
I'll owe a huge debt
to your camp,

55
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:26,791
anything within my power.

56
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:30,458
- Should I choose
to accept that proposal,

57
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:31,833
it would mean
Emilia's withdrawal

58
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:33,083
of her royal selection
candidacy.

59
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:35,708
You do understand that,
don't you?

60
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:37,833
- [gasps]
- What'd you expect?

61
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:38,750
To place
your own domain's survival

62
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:41,083
in the hands of another lord

63
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:42,750
calls into question
your ability to rule the nation.

64
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:46,458
With that in mind,
I ask again,

65
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:48,666
if you incur a debt to me
through this deal,

66
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,500
it will mean the elimination
of Emilia's camp from the
race.

67
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:54,000
Are you certain
that's what you want?

68
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:58,791
- Knowing that,
I still want your help.

69
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:01,625
If she dies,
everything ends anyway.

70
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:04,500
- I understand.

71
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:06,458
In that case,
the Karsten family

72
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:08,958
will lend you no assistance
in this matter whatsoever.

73
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:10,625
- Huh?

74
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,333
- Well, to begin with,

75
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,750
the condition
of having Emilia withdraw,

76
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:15,750
which you offered up
in desperation

77
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:18,083
as an advantage to me,

78
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:21,833
has no weight whatsoever
in my negotiation with you.

79
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:23,291
- What? But why?!

80
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:26,250
Isn't removing one of your
rivals enough compensation?

81
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:28,333
- Are you truly
not aware of the reason?

82
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:31,333
Emilia's elimination from
the royal selection process

83
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:32,791
is going to happen
with or without

84
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:33,666
any involvement on my part.

85
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,833
- Then you'll
just let the Witch's Cult

86
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:37,833
slaughter all the people
in Roswaal's domain?

87
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:39,375
How can you be so heartless?

88
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:41,875
- Don't change the subject,
Subaru Natsuki.

89
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:44,291
It is Emilia who's unable
to protect that domain

90
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:46,041
and Emilia whose people
will die for her incompetence.

91
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:48,708
I will not share
the blame for that.

92
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:51,708
- But isn't it wrong to know
people will die and not stop
it?

93
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,375
If you have
the power to save them,

94
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:54,791
why wouldn't you
choose to do so?!

95
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:56,375
- Listen, you.
I've heard enough of your--

96
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:57,291
- It's fine.

97
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:59,208
Allow me to correct
one idea you have.

98
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:02,416
Say the Witch's Cult
does make a move,

99
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,541
that what you say
comes to pass.

100
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:06,708
The problem comes afterward.

101
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:07,875
- Afterward?

102
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:08,958
- My point is simple.

103
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:11,291
How do you know the details

104
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:13,875
of exactly when and where
the cult will attack?

105
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:16,083
- Uh, I can't say.

106
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:18,291
- If you're a member
of the Witch's Cult,

107
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:20,833
it would make sense
that you would know.

108
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:22,708
- What a load of crap!
- Miss Crusch,

109
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:24,541
please don't joke
about something like that.

110
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:27,708
You know full well that Subaru
isn't one of their members.

111
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:29,708
- Really? Given everything
that was said,

112
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:32,750
if he can't explain how he
knows these intricate details,

113
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,708
then I can draw
no other conclusion.

114
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:36,750
Have you never
sensed or questioned

115
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:37,541
any such inclination in him?

116
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:40,458

offer any assistance to Emilia

00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:17,125
- Huh?
- Sorry.

162
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:20,000
I'm afraid I cannot allow you
to come any closer.

163
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:22,333
- Subaru...
- [gasps]

164
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:24,416
- you need to calm down.

165
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:29,208
- Either through experience
or instinct,

166
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:31,750
I can generally tell when
the person I'm speaking
with

167
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:33,166
is lying or telling the truth.

168
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,875
I'm quite proud of the fact
that, over the years,

169
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:38,833
I have never once been deceived
in negotiations.

170
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:41,208
And from those years
of experience,

171
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:42,041
I can tell you aren't lying.

172
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:43,083
- Then why won't you--

173
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:45,708
- You adamantly believe

174
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:47,625
that your rantings
are the truth,

175
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:49,791
certain what you're saying
is right.

176
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:52,708
That is nothing short
of madness, Subaru Natsuki.

177
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:54,750
- [sputters]

178
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:58,875
- Felix, would you mind
healing his lip?

179
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:00,833
- Don't bother!

180
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:04,125
Rem, let's go.

181
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:06,875
CRUSCH: Do you have
anywhere else to turn?

182
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:08,958
- I hope that you
become a great ruler,

183
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:11,750
the kind of dictator
who abandons the weak.

184
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:18,208
- I thank you
in my master's stead

185
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:21,541
for the kindness and care
you've given us during our stay.

186
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:25,708
What will we do?

187
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:26,416
If what you say is true,

188
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,041
we have little time
to prevent it.

189
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:30,958
- Wait. "If" it's true?
- [gasps]

190
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:33,166
We need to hurry now.

191
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,291
Shall we return
to Lord Roswaal's mansion?

192
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:38,166
- Not yet. There isn't much
that the two of us could do

193
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,083
by going back there right now.

194
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:41,833
There simply
aren't enough of us.

195
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:44,125
And what the hell
could he be doing, anyway?

196
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:45,750
- Lord Roswaal is traveling.

197
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:47,625
He's been required to visit

198
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:49,250
some officials
within the domain,

199
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:51,875
and he'll be staying with them
for a few days.

200
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:52,916
- I suppose that explains

201
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,625
why he can't do anything
about the attack.

202
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:56,041
Then we won't get anywhere

203
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:58,291
unless we can bring back
some reinforcements.

204
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:00,750
[gasps]

205
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:02,250
What about Reinhard?
He's a knight.

206
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,875
Wouldn't he
be able to help us?

207
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:05,375
- He mentioned something
yesterday about being away

208
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:07,791
from the capital for a while
on a courtesy call.

209
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:09,708
- Damn it!

210
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:12,125
Why are you all
so completely useless?!

211
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:13,291
Uh...

212
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:17,375
[groans]

213
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:20,125
Tomorrow we'll have to look
for somebody else to help us.

214
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:23,041
You head to the knights station.

215
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:25,875
I'm going to talk
to one of the other candidates.

216
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:27,125
- Very well.

217
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:27,958
[birds chirping]

218
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:30,125
PRISCILLA:
The Witch's Cult, you say?

219
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:31,625
- That's right.

220
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:34,125
If left alone,
they'll hurt lots of people,

221
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:37,125
and Emilia isn't gonna be
their only victim.

222
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:38,125
I want to stop them
before that happens.

223
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:41,750
- That's why I--
- [laughs]

224
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:42,916
Amusing.

225
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,916
You are most amusing.

226
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,125
But of course.

227
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:47,958
Any jester
who makes it this far

228
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:49,791
must be a true master
of his craft.

229
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:51,958
- [sputters]
What's so funny about this?!

230
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:53,416
- I can appreciate
your desperation,

231
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,958
but you haven't
really thought things through.

232
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:59,000
In trying to aid your ally,

233
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:00,125
you corner them
and lose all control,

234
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:02,708
benefitting the enemy.

235
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:04,708
Honestly,
you're better off dying.

236
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:07,916
In fact, I suppose
I could render you that courtesy

237
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
by simply lopping off your head
at this very moment.

238
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:12,000
- [gasps]

239
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:13,208
- Still...

240
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:15,208
even in the face
of such harsh treatment,

241
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:17,291
you maintain the devotion
you show for your master.

242
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:19,833
That, at least, is commendable.

243
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:22,250
So then...

244
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:24,041
I'll make you an offer.

245
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,250
- A-An offer?

246
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,708
- An opportunity, if you will,

247
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:29,208
what you would call a chance.

248
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:30,416
- [groans]

249
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:32,583
- Lick it.
- [gasps]

250
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:35,333
- I want you
to crawl across the floor,

251
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:37,708
savoring the shame
and humiliation.

252
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:39,291
Then like a meek
and wretched beast,

253
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:42,208
like a little baby
suckling on its mother's teat,

254
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:44,041
extend your tongue,
and lick my foot.

255
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:45,333
If you can do that,

256
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:47,916
then I will consider
your proposal.

257
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,125
- Uh...

258
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:51,291
- If you don't want to,
that's fine.

259
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:53,583
If you'd rather favor
your miniscule pride

260
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:55,750
and abandon the mistress
you wagged your tail for

261
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:58,041
to the wasteland, then so be it.

262
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:01,416
Either choice you make will
most assuredly entertain me.

263
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,958
- [stammers]

264
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:04,791
[no audible dialogue]

265
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,208
Fine. I-I'll do it.

266
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,125
- I guess you really are...

267
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:28,750
just an insignificant man.

268
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:32,000
- [groans]

269
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:34,208
- What you displayed was
neither loyalty nor devotion.

270
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:36,166
It's something filthier,

271
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,833
like a dog's dependence

272
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:39,416
or a pig's insatiable greed,

273
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,416
one who knows only how to want.

274
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,500
A pig's greed
is the ugliest thing there is.

275
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,833
Even if by some chance

276
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:48,125
the Witch's Cult is defeated,

277
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,041
I swear that I will strike down

278
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,916
any camp you are a part of.
Do you hear me?

279
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,291
Your careless behavior
and disdainful attitude

280
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:56,041
have led me to that decision.

281
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:57,458
[both grunt]

282
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:59,750
- [groans]

283
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:02,875
- Aldebaran.

284
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:05,833
- Whoa, whoa.
What happened in here?

285
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:08,791
- Throw that detestable fool
out the front door,

286
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:10,708
or you can kill him.
It matters not.

287
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:13,458
- Uh, I think
that matters quite a bit.

288
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:14,958
Let's go, brother.

289
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:18,375
Don't get so mad, Princess.

290
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:21,291
That fierce look will make
your cute face drop in value.

291
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,125
- Unless you want
your ruined face

292
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,166
even further ruined,

293
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,875
I suggest you take him away
at once, Aldebaran.

294
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:29,333
- I've told you
not to call me that.

295
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:32,125
Can you stand, brother?

296
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:33,458
- Yeah.

297
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:35,791
- You seem okay.

298
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:37,000
I don't know
what you were talking about,

299
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:40,833
but from the looks of things,
it didn't go very well, did
it?

300
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:44,083
Hmm.

301
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:45,208
Eh, if I take too long,

302
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:47,083
she might tell me
to chop you in half,

303
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:48,958
so I'm gonna head back inside.

304
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:50,000
Keep your chin up!

305
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:51,458

<i>I'm the one who saved her.</i>

309

[sputters]

310
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:03,375
Forget about them.

311
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:05,833
You don't have time
for those idiots.

312
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:06,375
- Sniff, sniff, sniff, sniff.

313
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:09,000
That looks super painful.

314
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:10,416
Are you okay?

315
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,333
- Huh?

316
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:13,458
- You smell like blood,

317
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:16,208
and not just from your lip.

318
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:17,416
Was your nose all bleedy?

319
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,375
- [groans]
- WOMAN: Now, Mimi,

320

- no getting into mischief.
- Okay!

321
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:26,041
- I'm awfully sorry if this
little one's been bothering you.

322
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:27,541
Hmm? Aren't you...

323
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:30,375
Right. You're that Natsuki guy,

324
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:33,375
Emilia's knight, Subaru Natsuki.

325
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:35,416
Isn't this a coincidence?

326
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:38,875
- Anastasia Hoshin.

327
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:43,208
MIMI: All right! Let's eat!

328
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:45,250
[overlapping chatter]

329
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:47,083
- So about
the dragon-drawn carriage...

330
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:49,208
- Wow, you don't
beat around the bush, do you?

331
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:50,375
A word of advice,

332
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:53,916
you won't make anyone happy
putting your own goals first.

333
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,375
The basic rule of negotiation

334
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:57,541
is to try to get
on the other's good side.

335
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:58,416
That's where you're lacking,
Natsuki.

336
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,583
- I'm sorry about that,

337
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:02,208
but I've got
a real problem here.

338
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:04,875
I need to leave the capital
by tomorrow. Please help.

339
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:06,916
- When you're
up against my kind,

340
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,541
trying to appeal
to sentimentality

341
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:11,083
is the worst strategy
there is.

342
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:13,375
But still,
I applaud all your efforts.

343
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:15,916
It's no easy task

344
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,250
to find a dragon-drawn carriage
in the capital right now.

345
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:22,250
Apparently someone's
buying up all of them.

346
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:23,916
Here you go.
The place at this address

347
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,958
should have a carriage left,

348
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:25,750
and I've signed it
with my own name,

349
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:27,416
so there shouldn't be
any problems.

350
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,333
This'll square everything away.

351
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:34,666
- Give me a break.
Don't put on airs.

352
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,125
- I surely will put on airs.
It's no fun at all

353
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:38,375
if I just hand it
to you normally, right?

354
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:39,583
And besides, I really wanted

355
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:42,250
to chat with you
about this and that.

356
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:43,125
- But why would you even bother?

357
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:45,458
It's not as if you
gain anything from it.

358
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:47,166
- You might feel that way,

359
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,625
but as for me, I believe
there's nothing in this world

360
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:52,125
that has no meaning,
because you just never know

361
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:54,250
who might give you
some unexpected inspiration.

362
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:56,083
- [sighs] All right.

363
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:57,291
What do you want to talk about?

364
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:59,625
- Hey, My Lady,

365
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:02,375
I want to eat a little more.
Is it okay if I order?

366
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:04,458
- Sure. Eat all you like.

367
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:07,000
Oh, but don't get your mouth
all messy with sauce.

368
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:08,291
- Wipe my face, pretty please!

369
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:10,625
[giggles]

370
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:12,041
All clean!

371
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:13,291
I'll be back! [laughs]

372
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:15,458
- Despite her looks,

373
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:18,000
she's second-in-command
in my private army.

374
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,500
- Private army, huh?

375
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:22,333
- I'll take one of the blue...
- It's quite famous in
Kararagi.

376
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:26,166
the Hoshin Company's personal
mercenary squad, Iron Fang.

377
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,666
Isn't she the super-cutest?

378
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:31,333
Nothing beats sleeping
with that girl in your arms.

379
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:32,291
- [carriage rattles]
- Hmm?

380
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:33,791
Seems like lots of people

381
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:36,666
have been gathering
in the capital lately.

382
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:37,666
Have you noticed the atmosphere

383
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,583
feels a little different now,
Natsuki?

384
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:42,958
- Huh? Guess now that
you mention it,

385
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:45,375
everybody did seem
to be in a frenzy.

386
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:46,625
Because of the royal selection?

387
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:49,166
- When those on top move,
the people move.

388
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,208
When the people move,
things move.

389
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:53,750
And I've noticed that the value
of goods in the capital

390
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:56,541
is fluctuating a lot now,
but some of the most valued ones

391
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:58,541
seem to be
various iron products.

392
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,625
Weapons like swords
and spears and such

393
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:03,041
are being gathered
from both inside and outside.

394
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:04,666
- Wait. Iron and weapons?

395
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,708
They're not planning on doing
something totally crazy

396
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:07,791
like going to war
with those things, are they?

397
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:10,333
- It's also possible
their objective

398
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:12,041
- isn't to acquire the items...
- [squeals]

399
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:13,583
- but to get
the economy rolling.

400
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:15,708
- The way you said that...

401
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:18,958
tell me, is it well known
who's gathering all this iron?

402
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:21,333
- Happens to be someone
you've already met, Natsuki.

403
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,500
It's Duchess Crusch Karsten.

404
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,583
- What? Are you serious?

405
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:27,958
Come to think of it,

406
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:30,541
she did have
a constant stream of visitors.

407
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:31,708
I get it.

408
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:34,541
Then that's probably
why that Russell guy

409
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:36,083
stopped by her place.

410
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:37,666
- Russell Fellow?

411
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,583
He's quite a big fish.

412
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:42,708
Well, this has been
fairly informative.

413
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:44,250
Thank you kindly, Natsuki.

414
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:46,083
- [gasps]

415
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:48,291
- You just left
Miss Crusch's place

416
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:50,208
after fighting with her
last night, right?

417
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:53,166
So I figured it'd be easy
to sit down for a while

418
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,583
and get all sorts
of information

419
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:57,041
from your mouth, eyes,
and expressions.

420
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,416
- [gasps]

421
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,708
So you set me up
from the very start?

422
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:07,625
I'd bet you're pretty pleased
with yourself, huh?

423
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:10,666
Look at you, pulling that
sneaky, underhanded crap.

424
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,041
Listen, Subaru.

425
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:12,958
If you want to convince
someone you're righteous,

426
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:14,916
you've gotta show
something to merit it,

427
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,958
and I don't see anything
like that at all in you.

428
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:20,583
For most people, the only way
to change a reputation

429
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:23,125
is to replace it with another.

430
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:26,291
What determines your reputation
are the things you've done,

431
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:27,791
that is, your past,

432
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:29,375
and there's no way
to go back and change that,

433
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:33,333
so my opinion of you isn't going
to change, either. You see?

434
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:35,583
The things you've done
won't ever go away.

435
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:36,708
It's just that simple.

00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:43,625
but don't get
any closer to My Lady.

440
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:45,666
I'm super-duper strong,
you know.

441
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,458
- Thanks, Mimi.

442
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:49,875
But you don't
have to do anything.

443
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:52,583
There's nothing Natsuki
can do about this, anyway.

It's partly my fault, though.

I suppose even you wouldn't do
something as dumb as that.

I'm actually kind of relieved.

Come on, Mimi. Let's go.

452
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:10,958

The key to being
a good negotiator

is to do your homework

and come to the table
totally prepared.

458
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:24,375
Make sure you know
what the other person wants

459
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:25,708
and dangle it in front of 'em.

460

Since all you do is
think about what you want,

461
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:29,541
there's a flaw in your approach.

Anyway, Rem, how did it go?

of the Witch's Cult

to the knight station
like we discussed earlier.

I also gave them
Lord Roswaal's name,

we were hoping for.

00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,333
REM: It seems
the knights have received

480
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:22,541
several such reports
about the cult already.

481
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:24,958
They said since
their background is unclear,

482
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:28,375
they receive countless anonymous
tips that can't be verified.

483
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,541
- If that's how
the real cultists managed

484
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:33,000
to stay hidden,
that's no laughing matter.

485

of
military force together,

- We'll go back to the mansion.

489
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:48,166
We'll go back and take
Emilia and Ram away from there

490
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:49,500
to the capital
or to wherever Roswaal is

Where they are now is dangerous.

There's no time left.
We've gotta get moving.

496
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,291

<i>away from the Witch's Cult.</i>

497
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:08,416

to the Mathers domain?

00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:21,458
- SUBARU: Yeah.
- It's already late.

503
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:23,666
Isn't heading out now
too dangerous?

504
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:24,625
We were planning
to camp here tonight.

505
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:26,958
Would you care to join us?

506
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:29,125
- No, what you're saying
makes a lot of sense, Otto,

507
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:31,750
but I bet you'd really
rather find a couple of suckers

508
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:33,458
to buy some of that oil
that you bought out of season.

509
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:35,541
[laughter]

510
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:37,625
- You're wrong!
That's not my intention at all!

511
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:38,958
Though to be fair,

512
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:40,000
there is a bit of truth
to what he's saying.

513
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:42,625
I was kind of hoping
the two of you

514
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:43,500
could use a little oil.

515
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:45,916
- What's this oil
you keep talking about?

516
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,708
- Oh, I just made a mistake
with one of my purchases,

517
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:51,458
and to be honest with you,
now I'm stuck with a whole bunch

518
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:54,250
that really isn't in too much
of a demand this time of year.

519
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:56,875
Even if we go
somewhere bustling,

520
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:59,708
like the capital, I don't know
if I'll be able to sell it off.

521
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:00,708
If I can't find
a lot of buyers for it,

522
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:03,000
I'm totally ruined!

523
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:04,666
Totally ruined.

00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:07,041

525
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:10,375
- I-I need to ask for your help.
- Uh...

526
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:12,416

you have in your carriage,

527
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,666
but I'm gonna need
a favor from you in return.

528
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,250
Lend us transport,
and leave tonight.

We're transporting people!

any part in human trafficking.

- Relax. I'm not running
that kind of side business.

There's a small village

not too far

OTTO: It's not ideal,
but if we run through the night,

543
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:49,875
we should enter
the Mathers domain

- Sorry we can't take
any breaks.

546
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:56,708
- No problem. If I can
get rid of my excess stock

547
00:21:56,791 --> 00:21:57,416
and even earn transport fees,

548
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,625
I feel it's absolutely worth it.

have noticed it yet,

but there's one in your bag.

00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:13,541
But it's too dark
to see much of anything.

- It's a bit of lost technology.

560
00:22:25,166 --> 00:22:27,083
I mean, it's future technology
called a cell phone.

I suppose it's a good thing

it just barely has

have there, Natsuki?

should probably forget

you ever laid eyes on it.

talking about dark dealings

- Just a little bit farther
in this direction,

standing so tall
in the Lifaus Highway,

that a wise man named Flügel

He didn't
get distracted by the tree

- Run past it to the left!

638
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:44,625
- [gasps] To the left.

639
00:25:44,708 --> 00:25:46,833
To the left. To the left.
To the left.

640
00:25:46,916 --> 00:25:49,000
To the left.
To the left. To the left!

641

- [screams]

643
00:25:55,041 --> 00:25:58,708

- [wails]

645
00:26:03,875 --> 00:26:04,291
- So did you get it?

646
00:26:04,375 --> 00:26:06,791
Did you bring it down?

647
00:26:06,875 --> 00:26:10,625
- [roars]

648
00:26:10,708 --> 00:26:11,916
- It didn't work.

649
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,916
- Wh-Why is it zeroing in on us?

650
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,375
There are other carriages
out there to pick from.

651
00:26:16,458 --> 00:26:19,041
- I don't know, but complaining
won't change anything about it.

652
00:26:19,125 --> 00:26:21,875
[groans] Come on. Think.

653
00:26:21,958 --> 00:26:22,625
Just think of something,
damn it.

654
00:26:22,708 --> 00:26:25,291
We need to find
a way out of this.

655
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:27,666
Isn't there something
we can do, anything?

656
00:26:28,083 --> 00:26:30,666
- Subaru.

657
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:32,666
Here. I want you to take this.

658
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:34,833
- Wait. Did you
come up with something?

659
00:26:34,916 --> 00:26:37,666
- I'll jump off this carriage
and intercept it,

660
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:40,333
and in the meantime,
you two can escape the fog.

661
00:26:40,416 --> 00:26:41,208
- [gasps]
- Mr. Otto,

662
00:26:41,291 --> 00:26:44,208
please take care of Subaru.

663
00:26:44,291 --> 00:26:46,875
He carries with him
the payment we promised you.

664
00:26:46,958 --> 00:26:48,208
- What?! My payment?

665
00:26:48,291 --> 00:26:49,208
That's the least
of our problems right now!

666
00:26:49,291 --> 00:26:52,000
We have to stay alive first!

667
00:26:52,083 --> 00:26:53,500
- Subaru, I'm not very smart,

668
00:26:53,583 --> 00:26:55,916
so this is the only plan
I could come up with.

669
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,833
Now please...

670
00:26:57,916 --> 00:26:59,541
- [gasps] Hold on a second, Rem.

671
00:26:59,625 --> 00:27:02,000
I'm not gonna let you.
I'm not gonna let you go!

672
00:27:02,083 --> 00:27:03,250
Don't do it! You can't.

673
00:27:03,333 --> 00:27:04,666
If you die, too, then I'll...

674
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,166
[both gasp]

675
00:27:08,458 --> 00:27:09,791
[Rem gasps]

676
00:27:12,916 --> 00:27:13,708
Don't worry about me.

677
00:27:13,791 --> 00:27:17,375
I believe I was born
for this very moment.

678

[groans]

681
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,083
What did you...

682
00:27:25,166 --> 00:27:27,000
- [groans]
- [coins clink]

683
00:27:27,083 --> 00:27:28,250
- It'll be all right.

684
00:27:28,333 --> 00:27:31,750
And never forget I will
always be watching over you.

685
00:27:31,833 --> 00:27:31,875
I promise.

686
00:27:35,208 --> 00:27:36,375
[music ends]

687

- [wind blowing]

691
00:27:58,291 --> 00:27:59,416
Where's Rem?

692
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,750
- Natsuki, you're awake.

693
00:28:01,833 --> 00:28:03,375
Stay down, and don't move!

694
00:28:03,458 --> 00:28:05,458
The ground dragon's
still running at full speed!

695
00:28:05,541 --> 00:28:08,083
Stay there! I don't have time
to worry about you right now!

696
00:28:08,166 --> 00:28:10,041
- I don't care about that,
damn it!

697
00:28:10,125 --> 00:28:12,291
Where's Rem?
What happened to Rem?

698
00:28:12,375 --> 00:28:13,083
Just answer me, Otto!

699
00:28:13,166 --> 00:28:15,750
What has happened to Rem?!

700
00:28:16,041 --> 00:28:18,291
- [sighs]

701
00:28:18,375 --> 00:28:20,541
So the two of us
could have a chance to escape,

702
00:28:20,625 --> 00:28:24,083
she jumped out of the carriage
to intercept the White Whale.

703
00:28:24,166 --> 00:28:25,875
- [gasps]

704
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,916
Go back.

705
00:28:31,041 --> 00:28:31,625
- Huh?!

706
00:28:31,708 --> 00:28:33,458
- You heard me. I said go back!

707
00:28:33,541 --> 00:28:37,291
We have to!
We have to try and save Rem!

708
00:28:37,375 --> 00:28:39,000
Go back right now!

709
00:28:40,333 --> 00:28:41,541
- Stop! What good
do you think that'll do?!

710
00:28:41,625 --> 00:28:44,333
Didn't you see it?
Don't you understand

711
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:46,250
how terrifying
that monster really is?

712
00:28:46,333 --> 00:28:47,791
Going back would be suicide!

713
00:28:47,875 --> 00:28:49,791
- I saw that damn monster
up close!

714
00:28:49,875 --> 00:28:51,791
That's why
I'm telling you to do it!

715
00:28:51,875 --> 00:28:53,458
- [groans]
- Get ahold of yourself!

716
00:28:53,541 --> 00:28:55,166
That's completely insane!

717
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:56,791
Do you want the hope she gave us

718
00:28:56,875 --> 00:28:58,583
to go to waste
and be for nothing?!

719
00:28:58,666 --> 00:29:01,791
Don't you dare say
anything about Rem!

720
00:29:01,875 --> 00:29:03,125
You totally abandoned her.

721
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:05,125
You have no right to talk
about her! Understand?!

722
00:29:05,208 --> 00:29:06,083
- Go back!
- You still don't see

723
00:29:06,166 --> 00:29:09,291
how horrible the White Whale
truly is, do you?

724
00:29:09,375 --> 00:29:10,541
Lugunica brought
their best warriors together.

725
00:29:10,625 --> 00:29:12,500
Their goal was to bring
the White Whale down.

726
00:29:12,583 --> 00:29:15,208
That beast killed
the first Master Swordsman

727
00:29:15,291 --> 00:29:15,833
like it was nothing!

728
00:29:15,916 --> 00:29:17,500
There's no way we can win.

729
00:29:17,583 --> 00:29:20,125
- [gasps] The Master Swordsman?

730
00:29:20,208 --> 00:29:21,125
No way.

731
00:29:22,916 --> 00:29:23,916
- I'm weak, okay?

732
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,166
And so are you. There's nothing

733
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:28,583
that either one of us
could do to save that girl.

734
00:29:28,666 --> 00:29:30,166
- [gasps]

735
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:31,500
But what about Rem?

736
00:29:31,583 --> 00:29:34,958
She isn't really
all that strong, either.

737
00:29:36,833 --> 00:29:39,333
- We were fortunate enough
to escape that monster for now,

738
00:29:39,416 --> 00:29:41,000
but in the cover of this mist,

739
00:29:41,083 --> 00:29:42,583
there's no telling
when it'll show up again.

740
00:29:42,666 --> 00:29:44,333
- [gasps] Otto.

741
00:29:44,416 --> 00:29:46,333
Careful with
that mouth of yours.

742
00:29:46,416 --> 00:29:48,333
- Huh?
What do you mean, Natsuki?

743
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:50,833
- Don't talk like this is
some kind of stupid game!

744
00:29:50,916 --> 00:29:52,458
You're saying
we were fortunate?!

745
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:53,791
You've gotta be kidding.

746
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:55,458
Think about how Rem
must have felt.

747
00:29:55,541 --> 00:29:56,416
She jumped without--

748
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,208
- Wait a second. Who is Rem?

749
00:29:58,291 --> 00:29:59,500
- Huh?

750
00:30:00,875 --> 00:30:03,500
There was nobody with that name
among our caravan,

751
00:30:03,583 --> 00:30:05,375
not among the merchants
or any of their companions.

752
00:30:05,458 --> 00:30:08,250
So who are you talking about?

753
00:30:10,333 --> 00:30:12,541
- [screams]
- [ground dragon bellowing]

754

do you think you're doing?!

755
00:30:16,291 --> 00:30:17,708
- Come on. Cut the crap.

756
00:30:17,791 --> 00:30:20,333
You talk on and on
about how Rem helped us escape

757
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:22,458
and then ask about who she is?

758
00:30:22,541 --> 00:30:23,375
Do you have a death wish
or something?!

759
00:30:23,458 --> 00:30:24,708
- I'm telling you I seriously

760
00:30:24,791 --> 00:30:27,375
have no idea
what you're talking about.

761
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:29,000
Why are you going on like this,

762
00:30:29,083 --> 00:30:30,000
raging about people
who aren't even real?

763
00:30:30,083 --> 00:30:32,041
Did seeing the White Whale
make you lose your mind?

I thought we'd left it behind.

even in all this darkness?

773
00:30:54,333 --> 00:30:56,750
- Why?!
- Oh, Rem.

774
00:30:56,833 --> 00:31:00,125
- Is there--Is there some mark
that's making it follow us?

775
00:31:00,208 --> 00:31:01,166
- [gasps]

It can't be.

Is it a mabeast, too?

00:31:10,958 --> 00:31:13,250
It's being drawn here to me.

781
00:31:13,333 --> 00:31:14,208
I'm the mark
that it's following.

782
00:31:14,291 --> 00:31:16,875
[gasps] No.

Rem, I...

784
00:31:19,666 --> 00:31:21,000
I'm sorry.

785
00:31:21,083 --> 00:31:21,500
I caused this.

786
00:31:21,583 --> 00:31:24,208
It's all my fault.

Please die.

you not instinctively

that happened
between you two in the capital,

but I'm not that interested.

867
00:35:30,916 --> 00:35:32,333
Though I surmise,
judging by your reaction

868
00:35:32,416 --> 00:35:35,875
and somber demeanor, you did
something you shouldn't have.

00:36:16,666 --> 00:36:18,333

00:36:23,041 --> 00:36:24,291
- Huh?

you're talking about?

00:36:29,333 --> 00:36:30,416
You're being ridiculous.

Sh-She's your younger sister
with the blue hair!

892
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,958
You know! I'm talking about
Rem,
you sister! This is no time--

893
00:36:35,041 --> 00:36:37,916
- But I don't have
a younger sister.

894
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,500
- How can you say that?!

895
00:36:39,583 --> 00:36:42,208
If it wasn't for Rem--
That's right.

896
00:36:42,291 --> 00:36:42,875
What would you call
that entire mess

897
00:36:42,958 --> 00:36:44,916
in the mabeast forest? Remember?

898
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,041
You, Rem, and I fought those--

899
00:36:46,125 --> 00:36:49,625
- Something is seriously
wrong with you, Barusu.

900
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:52,666
As much as I hate to admit it,
you were half responsible

901
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:55,291
for the ulgarm eradication
that happened that day.

So no, I don't remember

905
00:37:00,208 --> 00:37:03,791
a long-lost sister named Rem
helping whatsoever.

906
00:37:03,875 --> 00:37:06,916
- [gasps] That isn't
the least bit funny.

907
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,791
Even for a nightmare, this
doesn't make any sense at all.

908
00:37:08,875 --> 00:37:11,875
- I assure you
this is not a joke.

909
00:37:11,958 --> 00:37:14,416
You must be the one
who's dreaming all this up.

Is that what you think?

912
00:37:19,541 --> 00:37:20,333
You're out of your mind!

913
00:37:20,416 --> 00:37:22,125
- Barusu, you should
stay in bed until you--

914
00:37:22,208 --> 00:37:25,416
- Shut up! Just--
Just be quiet, and watch!

915
00:37:32,791 --> 00:37:35,875
- No way. It can't be.

916
00:37:35,958 --> 00:37:38,916
- Barusu, are you satisfied?

917
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:39,750
- Rem, it's--

918
00:37:39,833 --> 00:37:42,625
it's like she...

I don't understand.

Anywhere but here.

I-If you have to ask why,

00:38:52,291 --> 00:38:55,000
then I would say
it's for your sake.

938
00:38:55,083 --> 00:38:57,500
I came back
to this place for you!

Weren't you
staying in the capital

to!
