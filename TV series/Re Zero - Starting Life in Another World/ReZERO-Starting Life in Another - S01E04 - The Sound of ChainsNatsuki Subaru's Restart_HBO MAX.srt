Hmm.

Oh, yeah.

What are you doing,
you buffoon?

1129
00:47:38,375 --> 00:47:39,750
Do you want to die or something?

1130
00:47:39,833 --> 00:47:41,500
- Of course not.
Don't be dumb.

1131
00:47:41,583 --> 00:47:43,416
That isn't what I want at all.

1132
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:47,208
I only wanna die once at the end
of a long and happy life.

1133
00:47:47,291 --> 00:47:48,916
That's how I really feel.

1134
00:47:50,125 --> 00:47:51,333
- You've got guts.

1135
00:47:51,416 --> 00:47:53,750
So you finally accept your fate?

1136
00:47:53,833 --> 00:47:56,083
- That's not a very
accurate description.

1137
00:47:56,166 --> 00:47:59,041
If anything,
I would say that now

1138
00:47:59,125 --> 00:48:00,708
I've made up my mind.

1139
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:03,208
Sorry.

1140
00:48:03,291 --> 00:48:04,916
I caused a lot of grief
for you guys

1141
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,625
by being such
a pathetic loser.

- [gasps]

1143
00:48:07,833 --> 00:48:09,750
So you do know something
about Rem!

1144
00:48:09,833 --> 00:48:12,458
- Nope, sorry, but I honestly
don't know a thing.

1145
00:48:12,541 --> 00:48:14,416
Frankly, there's too much
I don't know.

1146
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:17,958
Even so, I decided to learn more
about the things

1147
00:48:18,041 --> 00:48:20,625
I don't understand
and to not be in the dark.

1148
00:48:20,708 --> 00:48:22,291
- How can you possibly say that?

1149
00:48:22,375 --> 00:48:24,333
My sister Rem is already dead.

1150
00:48:24,416 --> 00:48:26,458
What can you do by learning
anything now?

1151
00:48:26,541 --> 00:48:27,791
It's way too late for that!

1152
00:48:27,875 --> 00:48:29,791
- I won't make any cool
statements about what

1153
00:48:29,875 --> 00:48:31,375
I'll be able to do.

1154
00:48:31,458 --> 00:48:34,291
After all, this is what happened
when I couldn't do anything.

1155
00:48:34,375 --> 00:48:37,041
I know better than anyone
that my words aren't convincing

in the least.

1157
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:40,291
But I do remember.

00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:43,333
I know parts of you two
that you've forgotten.

1160
00:48:44,625 --> 00:48:46,416
What is it you think you know
about Rem and me?

1161
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:47,916

what it is, do you?
