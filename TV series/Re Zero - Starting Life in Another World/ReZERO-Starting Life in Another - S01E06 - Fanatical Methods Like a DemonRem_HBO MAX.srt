00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,250
than I actually have.

162
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,291
- You make no sense at all.

163
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:52,375
But it's a fact that the chance
for you to be saved

164
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:53,583
is much lower now.

165
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:55,000
- Give it to me straight.

166
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:58,000
Exactly how low are my odds
for surviving here?

167
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:01,166
- What you're dealing with is
being eaten because of a spell.

168
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,375
If the one that's doing
the eating were to die,

169
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:05,916
logic dictates the meal would
be canceled, I suppose.

170
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,708
- So that's it, huh?

171
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:09,750
I just have to take down
every last one

172
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:11,708
of the things that cursed me.

173
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,291
[grunts]

174
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:16,208
But every last one of them
is way too many.

175
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:17,666
- Correct.

176
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:20,208
That's the reason why Bubby
hasn't told that silly girl

177
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,500
about the curse.

178
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:22,916
- If Emilia knew,

179
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,666
she'd definitely try to do more
than she's capable of.

180
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,500
Which makes me really happy
but also feel really scared

181
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:30,000
at the same time.

182
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:32,333
Difficulty level here
is seriously demonic.

183
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:33,750
This is impossible.

184
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:35,291
I might as well give up.

185
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:37,250
<i>- We didn't go through all</i>
<i>of this just to stop now.</i>

186
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:40,083
<i>Is there no other way</i>
<i>to save him?</i>

187
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:41,958
<i>- His head must be hurting,</i>
<i>I suppose.</i>

188
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:43,791
<i>Guess that's not</i>
<i>terribly surprising.</i>

189
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,791
<i>That's all, I suppose.</i>

190
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:49,958
<i>You can do as you like</i>
<i>with him now.</i>

191
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:53,750
<i>- I swear I'll save you.</i>

192
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,458
<i>- It can't be.</i>

193
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:59,458
Where is Rem?

194
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:01,041
Beako.

195
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:03,250
Beatrice, tell me.
Where is Rem?

196
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:06,291
If you were in her position,
what would you do, I suppose?

197
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:10,166
- I'm not going to ignore
what you just said.

198
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,166
- [grunts]
Ram.

199
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,458
- Miss Beatrice.

200
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:16,333
Rem didn't go into
the forest alone, did she?

201
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:19,125
- [panting]

202
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:20,625
<i>I have to.</i>

203
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:22,416
<i>I have to do this all on my own.</i>

204
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,291
<i>I have to save him.</i>

205
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:27,208
<i>No one else needs</i>
<i>to get hurt.</i>

206
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:28,500
<i>- But why?</i>

207
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:30,125
Why in the world would Rem go

208
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:31,708
to such dangerous lengths
for me?

209
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:33,250
- [grunts]
- Hey!

210
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:34,875
Hold on!

211
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:36,125
- Let go of me, Barusu!

212
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:38,250
I'm not calm enough
to be kind right now.

213
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:39,541
You need to release me at once!

214
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:40,958
- If you want to save Rem,

215
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:42,958
and if you consider me
an ally at all,

216
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,375
stop for a second, okay?

217
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:46,583
Do you know where she is?

218
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:48,833
- No, but if I use
my clairvoyance, I will.

219
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:50,208
- Your what?

220
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:52,750
- It's a special power that
allows me to see what all

221
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:55,541
the bugs and animals on my
wavelength are seeing as well.

222
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:59,416
- So all those eyes act like
your security cameras?

223
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,333
Well, if we can use it
to get to Rem,

224
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:02,708
then fine.

225
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:04,166
Now let me ask you.

226
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:06,708
Are you the kind
of maid that fights?

227
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:09,250
- What does a question
like that even mean?

228
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:11,958
- It means I plan on going into
the forest with you.

229
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:13,833
- You're following me?
- That's right,

230
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:15,208
'cause when it comes
to fighting,

231
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:16,416
I'll totally get in your way.

232
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,791
- [gasps]

233
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:20,166
If you expect me to be able
to fight like Rem does

234
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,708
in her demon form,
I can't.

235
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:23,666
- Wait a second.
You're twins, right?

236
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:24,958
If Rem is a demon,

237
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,708
wouldn't that make you
a demon, too?

238
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:28,333
- [gasps]

239
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:31,083
In a way,
I suppose that's true,

240
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:33,291
but unlike Rem,
I'm hornless.

241
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:34,458
- [grunts]

242
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:35,833
- [gasps]

243
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:38,541
I can only use a rather extreme
bit of wind magic.

244
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:40,250
[grunts]

245
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:41,833
[whooshing]

246
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:43,708
- Going to retrieve
the younger sister

247
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:45,958
from the dangers of the forest
would mean giving up

248
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:47,291
on your own life.

249
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:49,458
You do understand that fact,
I suppose.

250
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:51,708
- [chuckles]
Well, that's not quite right.

251
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:53,291
Let me correct you.

252
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:56,458
It's dumb to just start giving
up 'cause you're used to dying.

253
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:58,958
You get one life so you
should make the best of it.

254
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:01,166
That's something I realized
after you guys went through

255
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,708
so much to save mine.

256
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:05,875
So if you don't mind,
I'm gonna struggle pathetically.

257
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:08,583
Let's go out there
and make a comeback!

258
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:11,958
I've recovered from the terrible
state I was in earlier.

259
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:14,208
I guess you could say
I'm a greedy guy

260
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:16,750
because I wanna see
the continuation of this story

261
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:18,166
and with me in it.

262
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,625
Now I think it's time
to get moving

263
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:21,666
to our last big showdown!

264
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:24,833
You hear me, fate?
Bring it on!

265
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:29,125
[rain pattering]

266
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:30,416
- [grunts]

267
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,500
- I must say you gave

268
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:33,750
a pretty heroic speech
back there.

269
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:35,916
But when I see you lagging
behind so close

270
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,458
to becoming nothing but baggage,

271
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:39,416
it's difficult to hide
my disappointment.

272
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,458
- Give me a break.
I'm still recovering,

273
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:44,166
so my energy's spent
and I'm low on blood.

274
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:46,708
Oh, I didn't get the chance
to hear Mili say,

275
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:49,000
"I'll see you soon,"
in her sweet little voice.

276
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,583
- Until you say,
"I'm home,"

277
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:53,291
last night's "see you soon"
is still in effect.

278
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:55,791
- Oh, really?
Is that how it works?

279
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:58,458
- Besides, didn't you get
something from someone

280
00:11:58,541 --> 00:11:59,791
other than Miss Emilia?

281
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:01,750
- [grunts]

282
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:02,833
Sure did.

283
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:04,833
Something pretty beautiful,
in fact.

284
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:07,916
- I want you
to take this.

285
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,875
It's the sharpest sword
in the village.

286
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:11,416
- Thanks, I appreciate it.

287
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,208
- We're counting on you.
- Subaru!

288
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:14,833
- [grunts]
[all laughing]

289
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:16,458
all: Subaru!
- Hey, guys.

290
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:18,541
So you're all awake, huh?
- Where are you headed?

291
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:20,625
- Back into the forest?
- Don't do it.

292
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:22,875
It's dangerous, Subaru.
- I'll be fine.

293
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:24,375
Don't worry about a thing.

294
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:26,875
I'm not gonna go anywhere.
- So what's the sword for?

295
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:28,166
- You mean this?

296
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,500
- Let's call it a thank you gift
from all of us.

297
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,833
- I wanna thank you, too!
- Hey, easy!

298
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:35,125
[all laughing]

299
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:37,291
[grunts]

300
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,625
Candy,
a pretty stone.

301
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:43,958
I wonder what else
is in here.

302
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:46,916
Ah, it's a big freakin' bug!

303
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,750
Damn brats sneaking that gross
thing in while I was distracted.

304
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:51,583
I'll give them
a talking-to later.

305
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:53,250
- It's only proof
of their admiration,

306
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:55,500
though I wonder what they see
in a man like you.

307
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:57,208
- In the pure eyes of a child,

308
00:12:57,291 --> 00:13:00,666
my true manly nature shines like
a bright star in the night sky.

309
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:01,958
And as I recall,

310
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:03,500
I'm not the only one
they like, either.

311
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,583
You could tell, right?

312
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,416
- Yes, I could.

313
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,500
[all laughing]

314
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:12,208
- Hey, why did you put dirt
in there?

315
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,625
- [grunting]

316
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:17,375
- Ram-Ram!

317
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:20,041
We wanna thank Rem-Ram properly,

Barusu, I'm gong to use

00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:33,250
Give me a moment, all right?

324
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:54,208
Barusu, something nearby
is watching us both right now.

325
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,333
- What?
- Up there.

326
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:58,166

[grunts]
- Anyway,

333
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,541
why does it seem
like every individual

334
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:17,000
loses their head
when they see you?

335
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:19,833
To be perfectly honest,
I don't understand it at all.

336
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,416
Is it because you seem
like such a weakling?

337
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,500
- After all that hesitation,
that's your conclusion?

338
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:27,666
Rude.

339
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,083
- Is it because you seem
like a wimp, then?

340
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:30,750
- You may have reworded things
a bit,

341
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:32,333
but that doesn't change the root

342
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:34,208
of what you're saying,
Ram-Ram.

343
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,666
Hey, would it be okay
if I asked what that

344
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:41,041
hornless thing you
mentioned before means?

345
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:48,166
- It's nothing.

346
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:50,000
As the term implies,

347
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:53,041
it's another name for a foolish
demon without a horn.

348
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:56,625
Long ago, after getting into
a little trouble,

349
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:58,625
I lost the only one I had.

350
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:00,208
Since that point in time,

351
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:02,500
I've relied on Rem
for everything.

352
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:06,208
- I suppose I shouldn't have
asked about it then, huh?

353
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:08,250
- Why's that?
- Well, I'm not gonna pretend

354
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:09,791
like I know anything about
your people

355
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:12,416
or how important horns are
to the race you call demons,

356
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,583
but I assume it's a pretty
serious problem.

357
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:16,708
So I just figured after asking
about it that it might

358
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,708
have been a little insensitive
of me.

359
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:21,458
- Back then was one matter.

360
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:23,333
But now things have calmed down.

361
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:25,500
There are things I've gained
and lives I've saved

362
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:26,708
by losing my horn.

363
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:28,416
I'm sure Rem doesn't feel

364
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,250
the same way I do about it,
though.

365
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:31,625
- Huh?

366
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:35,375
- Originally, members
of the demon race had two horns

367
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:36,708
but when twins are born,

368
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:39,583
the pairs split with each child
having only one.
