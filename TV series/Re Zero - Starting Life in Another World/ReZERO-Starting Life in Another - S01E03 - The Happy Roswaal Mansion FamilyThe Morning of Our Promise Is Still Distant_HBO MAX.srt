00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:31,625
Really sorry I put you through
so much yesterday.

163
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:32,625
- Morning, Lia.

164
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:33,833
I came really close

165
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:35,500
to losing you back there,
didn't I?

166
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:38,000
I'll never be able
to thank Subaru enough.

167
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:39,916
I think I should do something
for him.

168
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,208
- Yeah?

169
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:44,000
Okay, let me pet your fur
whenever I feel like it.

170
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:46,291
- Huh?
Is that seriously all you want?

171
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:48,833
- For a first-rate fur master
such as myself,

172
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:51,541
being able to love on the object
of your petting affections

173
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:54,333
any time you want is worth just
as much as the troves

174
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:56,083
of a multi-millionaire's riches.

175
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:58,333
Oh, man, these ears.

176
00:07:58,416 --> 00:08:01,500
I'm so in love with how soft
and cuddly you are.

177
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:03,708
- I know you feel that way
since I can kind of read

178
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:04,916
your mind,
but I'm amazed you

179
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,250
can actually say it.

180
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:07,791
[laughs]
It's okay, Lia.

181
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:09,708
- [grunts]
- 'Cause I can't find any trace

182
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:11,708
of hostility or malice
in him at all.

183
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:14,041
- It's so cute how
you call her Lia, too.

184
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:17,000
- It's not half as cute
as when you called her Mili.

185
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:19,375
- You really are
a strange one, Subaru.

186
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,000
- Huh?

187
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,333
- [giggles]

188
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:24,125
- [groans]

189
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:27,166
- Well, look at this.

190
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,041
What brings you two here?
- [grunts]

191
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:30,666
both: Miss Emilia,

192
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:34,416
our lord Master Roswaal
has finally returned home.

193
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,208
Please, come inside.

194
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:38,041
[doors creaking]

195
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:41,625
- I was watching you
from upstairs,

196
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:42,625
and you know what?

197
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:43,791
It would appear that you

198
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:45,750
are quite the imbecile,
I suppose.

199
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:47,750
- And just where do you get off
saying that, you loli?

200
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:49,125
- What does that word mean?

201
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:51,541
I've never even heard it before
and it irritates me.

202
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:52,916
I think you just made it up.

203
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,916
- Betty!
Haven't seen you in four days.

204
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,916
Hope you've been doing well
and staying ladylike.

205
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,416
- Hello, Bubby!

206
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,250
I've been waiting so eagerly
for you to come home!

207
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,416
Will you stay with me today,
do you suppose?

208
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,875
- Yeah, sure.
No problem.

209
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:08,500
Today's the day we can finally
relax together.

210
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:10,833
- Aww, this'll be great!
- [giggles]

211
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:12,666
- Feeling bewildered,
aren't you?

212
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,541
Beatrice is so taken with Puck,
she can't get enough.

213
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:18,416
- I can't believe you just
said bewildered unironically.

214
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,833
- My, my!

215
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:22,250
How unusual to see you here,
Beatrice.

216
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:24,291
I'm so happy you're dining
with me.

217
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:27,916
I do ever so love your company
and treasure our times together.

218
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,125
- That boy is more than enough
addle-brained fool

219
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:31,333
for me, I suppose.

220
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:34,083
Betty was only waiting around
for Bubby.

221
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:36,750
- Wow, so you guys hired
a clown to entertain you

222
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:38,041
before each meal?

223
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:40,083
I'll never understand
how you rich folks think.

224
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:42,291
- Um, Subaru,
that man is actually--

225
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:44,500
- Oh, no, it's quite all right,
Miss Emilia.

226
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:46,333
I'll handle the introductions.

227
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:47,750
- What's going on?

228
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:49,750
- I am in fact the lord
of this manor.

229
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:51,333
Roswaal L. Mathers.

230
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:53,208
So very pleased
to make your acquaintance.

231
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:55,458
Subaru Natsuki, right?

232
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:57,458
[birds chirping]

233
00:09:57,541 --> 00:10:00,791
<i>[harp music]</i>

234
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:02,958
- Mmm?

235
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:05,125
This is way better
than normal food.

236
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:06,166
- Mm-hmm.

237
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,583
Despite her appearance,

238
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:09,416
Rem's cooking
is quite impressive.

239
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,833
- So this was cooked by the one
with the blue hair?

240
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:14,583
I think I got that right.

241
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:15,833
You made this?

242
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:17,166
- Yes, that's correct.

243
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,541
I'm responsible for all

244
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,250
of the cooking
in this household.

245
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:22,875
My sister doesn't happen
to be very good at cooking.

246
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:24,666
- Ah, so it's the old twins

247
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,583
who are good
at different things trope, huh?

248
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:28,791
So, your sister good
at cleaning, then, I take it?

249
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:30,375
- Yes, that's correct.

250
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:32,375
My sister excels
at housework chores,

251
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:33,750
especially cleaning and laundry.

252
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,333
- So while you're good
at cooking,

253
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:37,708
you're probably bad at cleaning
and laundry, right, Rem-rin?

254
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:39,041
- On the contrary,

255
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:41,291
I'm generally good
at all household tasks.

256
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:43,750
I'm also better at cleaning
and laundry than my sister.

257
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:44,875
- Seriously?

258
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:46,291
Does your sister
even have a purpose?

259
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:49,583
- You are truly
a unique young man.

260
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:52,166
You come to the mansion
of Margrave Mathers

261
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,708
in the kingdom of Lugunica

262
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:56,375
and you say you
don't understand a thing.

263
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:57,791
- So what do you mean by that?

264
00:10:57,875 --> 00:10:59,416
Is something bad happening
in this country?

265
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,708
- Well, it is not in
an agreeable state,

266
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:04,083
which only makes sense.

267
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:07,541
After all,
Lugunica doesn't have a king.

268
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,416
Now, don't look so alarmed.

269
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,166
There's no need to be concerned.

270
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,750
Everyone in this country
is already quite aware

271
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:15,833
of that circumstance being
their reality.

272
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:17,125
- Wow, really?

273
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:19,208
I expected a,
"Now that you know my secret,

274
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:20,833
I can't let you leave
here alive" thing.

275
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:23,916
- Roughly around the same time
the king went into hiding,

276
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,750
an epidemic began to spread
throughout the castle.

277
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:29,333
The king and his children
are the last of his line.

278
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:31,458
At this moment,
the nation is being managed

279
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:34,625
by a council of wise men
and that council is currently

280
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:36,458
in the process
of selecting a new king.

281
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:39,500
- Okay, think I'm starting
to get the picture now.

282
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:41,250
On top of the king's absence,

283
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,000
the royal selection
is causing confusion

284
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:44,166
in the kingdom.

285
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,666
Suddenly I appear
from another country--

286
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,375
wait, I'm totally suspect here!

287
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:49,000
- And on top of that,

288
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,625
you made contact
with Miss Emilia,

289
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:52,458
thus initiating
a direct connection

290
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:54,750
to my household.
Ah, the dilemma.

291
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:56,833
- Mm?
Hey, hold on a second.

292
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:57,958
Why would the lord
of the mansion

293
00:11:58,041 --> 00:11:59,291
call her Miss Emilia?

294
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:01,583
- I'm not sure how things are
where you're from,

295
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:05,166
but here we address those
with higher status respectfully.

296
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:06,708
- [grunts]
But, uh,

297
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:09,208
that would mean Mili here is,
uh--

298
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:13,625
- Officially, my current title
is candidate for the 42nd ruler

299
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:15,541
of the Kingdom of Lugunica,

300
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:18,625
with the backing of the honor
of Lord Margrave Roswaal.

301
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:19,958
- What?

302
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:21,625
- Sorry to surprise you
like that.

303
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:24,041
I wasn't trying to keep it
a secret or anything.

304
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:25,750
<i>[exciting music]</i>

305
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:27,708
- Hey, it's that insignia.

306
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:30,750
- This qualifies one
to be a candidate for king.

307
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,625
It's a ceremonial touch stone
that's used to determine

308
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:35,291
if one is worthy to sit
at the throne

309
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:36,875
and lead this country
as a monarch.

310
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:38,083
- Wait a second.

311
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:39,458
Are you saying you lost
an insignia

312
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:41,666
that qualifies you
to rule the kingdom?

313
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,791
- Now, don't put it like that!
I didn't lose it!

314
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:45,291
It was stolen from me
by a thief!

315
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:47,000
- That's the same thing!

316
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:49,625
And what happens if you manage
to lose that thing, anyway?

317
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:51,625
Will a government office
issue another one?

318
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:54,000
- Oh, what a dreadful scenario.

Shouldn't we be seeing something
by now?

475
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:28,333
- Cooking, laundry, cleaning--

476
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:30,250
He's useless at all of them.

477
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:32,041
- How very harsh of you.

478
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:35,416
And what are the chances
he's a spy?

479
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,000
- I can't deny
that such potential exists,

480
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,291
but I think the possibility
is slim at best,

481
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:41,791
'cause for better or for worse--

482
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:43,708
for worse in this case
in particular--

483
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:44,916
he's too conspicuous.

484
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,666
- And if he's too conspicuous,
then...

485
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:50,208
Well, despite the odds
of that possibility,

486
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:52,541
he certainly is carefree,
isn't he?

487
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:54,416
Personally as I see it,

488
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,791
it would be wise
to interfere with things.

489
00:18:58,333 --> 00:18:59,750
- They're both only children.

490
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:02,583
Even if we let them be,
nothing will happen.

491
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,333
- Huh.

492
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:11,750
- It's not that exciting
to watch, is it?

493
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:12,750
- You may think that,

494
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:13,958
but nothing's ever boring

495
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:15,416
when I'm hanging around you,
Mili.

496
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,583
- That's good to hear,

497
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:18,333
even if you're only
flattering me.

498
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:20,916
[chuckles]

499
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,666
- Besides, the two
of us haven't had

500
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:25,375
a chance to just talk
for the past few days, have we?

501
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:26,625
- That's true.

502
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:28,291
Bet it must have been difficult
for you to learn

503
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:29,708
the work expected of you here.

504
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:31,541
- Ain't that the truth?
It's killing me!

505
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:33,416
I wish I could be
tenderly comforted

506
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,500
in your arms,
your chest,

507
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:36,000
and your lap in rotation.

508
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:38,166
- If you can go around making
tasteless jokes like that,

509
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,583
you're probably fine.
- [groans]

510
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:42,166
[thuds]

511
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,583
Wow, the moon sure is pretty.

512
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:49,666
- And it's up in the heavens
far beyond our reach.

513
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:50,708
- Well, what do you know?

514
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:52,125
I got a really touching response

515
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:54,250
without even trying.
- [chuckles]

516
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:55,583
On another matter,

517
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:57,333
don't you think you're
a bit lacking in ambition?

518
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:58,875
Like that one time with Puck,

519
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:01,916
and in the capital when
you asked me for my name.

520
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,583
- You just don't get me at all,
do you, Emilia?

521
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:06,791
I want what I want
at that exact moment,

522
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:08,625
and I want it from the bottom
of my heart.

523
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,083
It's self-gratification
in its purest form.

524
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:12,625
- Huh?

525
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:13,958
- Right then,

526
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:16,416
I wanted to know your name
more than anything.

527
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,625
I had no expectations
for tomorrow

528
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:20,583
and I was simply trying
to make it through the day,

529
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:23,041
<i>and on top of that,</i>
<i>I was in a new land,</i>

530
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:25,958
<i>nervous, and so uncertain</i>
<i>about my future.</i>

531
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:27,291
Looking back on it,

532
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:29,958
there were probably other things
I should have wanted.

533
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:31,875
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

534
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:34,333
But I can't lie to myself
about things like that.

535
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:36,250
Same as the request
I made to Ros.

536
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:37,708
I'm flat broke right now.

537
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:40,208
I could choose to cheat him
out of a fortune and live it up,

538
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:42,541
but I can just as easily obtain
an ongoing source

539
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:44,583
of livelihood, right?
- In that case,

540
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:47,250
why didn't you simply choose
to become a permanent guest

541
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:48,250
rather than an employee?

542
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:49,958
- I never thought of that!

543
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:51,166
- [gasps]

544
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,458
- [grunting]

545
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:55,166
Oh, man!
What an idiot!

546
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,833
Talk about a pathetic effort,
huh?

547
00:20:57,916 --> 00:21:00,458
- DO you want me to use
my healing magic?

548
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:02,166
- Nah, I'm fine like this.

549
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:03,333
- Really?
Why?

550
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:04,416
- [groans]

551
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,875
It's kind of hard
for me to explain,

552
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:07,333
but the way I see it,

553
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:10,125
this is proof of all
the effort I've been putting in.

554
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:13,458
I don't exactly dislike
exerting myself, you know?

555
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:16,083
Learning to do something
I couldn't do before?

556
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:19,000
To be honest,
it's not so bad.

557
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:21,583
- Yes, I see.

558
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:23,750
I would never have thought
of it that way.

559
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:25,833
[sighs]
You're such an idiot, Subaru.

560
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:28,500
- Well, that wasn't the reaction
I was expecting.

561
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:31,541
Wasn't I charming?
- You could never be.

562
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,791
Well, maybe just a little.

563
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:40,791
- EMA.
- Huh?

564
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:43,291
- Oh, it's short
for Emilia Major Angel.

565
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:44,791
- I was being so sincere

566
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:46,708
and now you're joking
around again?

567
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:48,833
Anyway, I know
you're working hard,

568
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:51,083
but how did your hands get
like that just by doing

569
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:52,833
some household chores?

570
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:54,833
- This hand I cut
with a kitchen knife,

571
00:21:54,916 --> 00:21:57,583
and the one on the other hand
is from when I went to town

572
00:21:57,666 --> 00:21:59,458
in the evening to shop
and a little animal

573
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:01,166
some kids were playing with
bit me.

574
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:03,583
- It wasn't the result
of your labor efforts?

575
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:06,375
- Those kids were ruthless,
hitting and kicking me,

576
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:07,875
and wiping their
runny noses on me.

577
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:09,375
Gotta say,
kinda sucked.

578
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:11,541
- You do seem like the type
of person who'd be good

579
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:13,458
with small children, Subaru.
- Hey, wait.

580
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:14,708
I've got an idea.

581
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:16,458
Wanna come with me tomorrow
to get revenge

582
00:22:16,541 --> 00:22:17,666
on those little--I mean,

583
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:18,833
to watch the kids

584
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:20,291
and that small animal
play together?

585
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:23,791
- It's not as if I don't want
to go out there with you.

586
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:24,916
- Fine, then.
Let's go.

587
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,708
- But if--if I come along,

588
00:22:26,791 --> 00:22:28,833
it might end up causing
a lot of trouble for you.

589
00:22:28,916 --> 00:22:31,000
- Okay, understood.
Let's go.

590
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:32,625
- Are you even listening to me?

591
00:22:32,708 --> 00:22:34,208
- I am, I swear.

592
00:22:34,291 --> 00:22:36,375
I hang on every word
you say, Mili.

593
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:38,833
- Fine, then,

594
00:22:38,916 --> 00:22:40,500
but only when I'm able
to take a break

595
00:22:40,583 --> 00:22:42,250
from all of my studying
and your work is done

596
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:44,708
for the day, okay?
- [gasps]

597
00:22:44,791 --> 00:22:47,250
Yeah, all right!
This is gonna be great!

598
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:50,875
[both laughing]

599
00:22:50,958 --> 00:22:54,083
[humming]

600
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:57,125
Hey, loli girl.
I see you're still up.

601
00:22:57,208 --> 00:23:00,375
- So now you can just casually
break through my door crossing

602
00:23:00,458 --> 00:23:01,583
like it's natural,
I suppose.

603
00:23:01,666 --> 00:23:03,791
- Well, I just wanted
to say hello

604
00:23:03,875 --> 00:23:04,958
before going to bed.

605
00:23:05,625 --> 00:23:07,125
Can I try that, too?

606
00:23:07,875 --> 00:23:10,916
- Only Bubby has permission
to touch me, I suppose.

607
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,958
- Why should you get to have all
of the fun?

608
00:23:13,041 --> 00:23:14,250
I'm in a good mood
so I can let it go.

609
00:23:14,333 --> 00:23:15,291
- Enough!
Get out of here!

610
00:23:15,375 --> 00:23:16,583
- [groans]

611
00:23:20,541 --> 00:23:23,625
- And that had nothing to do
with Betty, I suppose.

612
00:23:23,708 --> 00:23:24,916
- For our date tomorrow,

613
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,458
I'll have to come up with
a clever excuse

614
00:23:26,541 --> 00:23:27,958
to ditch the kids
in the village.

615
00:23:28,041 --> 00:23:30,833
Oh, but first I gotta find out
where all the good views

616
00:23:30,916 --> 00:23:33,291
and the flower fields
and other stuff are.

617
00:23:33,375 --> 00:23:36,083
Crap, I can't sleep while
I'm thinking about this!

618
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:38,708
Oh, I know.

619
00:23:38,791 --> 00:23:42,750
One Puck to pet.
Two Pucks to pet.

620
00:23:42,833 --> 00:23:46,041
101 Pucks to pet.

621
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:48,500
[crickets chirping]

622
00:23:50,916 --> 00:23:52,333
A new dawn has come across
the land.

623
00:23:52,416 --> 00:23:53,750
A dawn of hope!

624
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:57,083
Subaru Natsuki is going
to make great strides today!

625
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,083
What are you two doing in here?

626
00:24:00,166 --> 00:24:03,041
This is so embarrassing!
You should have said something!

627
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,125
- Sister, Sister, I do believe
that our guest appears

628
00:24:06,208 --> 00:24:08,583
appears to be a bit confused.
What do you think?

629
00:24:08,666 --> 00:24:10,500
- Rem, Rem, yes,
I agree.

630
00:24:10,583 --> 00:24:12,250
It looks as though our guest

00:29:54,833 --> 00:29:57,125
- Eh, huh?
- Now follow me, Barusu.

792
00:29:57,208 --> 00:29:59,541
- Are you gonna show me around
this place or--

793
00:29:59,625 --> 00:30:01,416
- Not right now.
That will also wait.

794
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:04,291
You're going to be helping me
with my work first.

795
00:30:04,375 --> 00:30:06,166
- Hey, hang on a second!

796
00:30:07,916 --> 00:30:10,708
<i>Retrace the same path</i>
<i>I took yesterday.</i>

797
00:30:10,791 --> 00:30:11,875
<i>Simple.</i>

798
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,208
<i>That's what I meant to do,</i>
<i>but...</i>

799
00:30:15,958 --> 00:30:18,833
This is totally different
from what happened last time.

800
00:30:18,916 --> 00:30:20,416
It's like when you make
a cheat sheet

801
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,791
for a major exam
but when you see the answers,

802
00:30:22,875 --> 00:30:24,500
you realize
it's the wrong subject.

803
00:30:24,583 --> 00:30:25,958
Total waste of effort.
[doors opening]

804
00:30:26,041 --> 00:30:27,041
Hmm?

805
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:29,000
- Hi, there!
Mind if I join you?

806
00:30:29,083 --> 00:30:30,500
- Yes, I do.

807
00:30:30,583 --> 00:30:32,625
- This facility is part
of my mansion

808
00:30:32,708 --> 00:30:34,291
which makes it my property.

809
00:30:34,375 --> 00:30:36,375
Therefore I'll do with it
as I please.

810
00:30:36,458 --> 00:30:37,916
- Why bother asking permission?

811
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,125
Take a bath if you want to.

812
00:30:39,208 --> 00:30:41,750
- My, what harsh words
from the hired help.

813
00:30:41,833 --> 00:30:43,291
You don't seem to understand.

814
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:45,375
As we've both made
abundantly clear,

815
00:30:45,458 --> 00:30:47,041
this bath is my property,

816
00:30:47,125 --> 00:30:49,833
but as you are part of my staff,

817
00:30:49,916 --> 00:30:54,750
does it not stand to reason
that you're my property as well?

818
00:30:54,833 --> 00:30:56,875
- Chomp.
- No hesitation at all.

819
00:30:56,958 --> 00:31:00,125
<i>This is turning out different</i>
<i>from what I'd expected, too.</i>

820
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:02,250
- I don't know
what's bothering you,

821
00:31:02,333 --> 00:31:04,583
but you'll come to discover
that life is full of things

822
00:31:04,666 --> 00:31:06,416
that don't go your way.

823
00:31:07,166 --> 00:31:09,500
Incidentally, what do you think
of my support staff?

824
00:31:09,583 --> 00:31:11,083
Getting along famously, I hope.

825
00:31:11,166 --> 00:31:13,416
- I haven't spoken that much
to Rem at this point,

826
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,083
but I get along
just fine with Ram.

827
00:31:15,166 --> 00:31:16,583
In fact, I think she might

828
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:18,125
be getting
a little too friendly.

829
00:31:18,208 --> 00:31:20,625
I can't believe she can work
as a maid that way.

830
00:31:20,708 --> 00:31:23,458
- Well, Rem handles the things
Ram is unable to do.

831
00:31:23,541 --> 00:31:25,708
As sisters,
they must help each other.

832
00:31:25,791 --> 00:31:27,541
If you think about it
in that sense,

833
00:31:27,625 --> 00:31:30,416
I believe the two of them
are getting by quite well.

834
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,916
It seems like Ram's the inferior
version of her sister

835
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,791
and all Rem does
is cover for her,

836
00:31:34,875 --> 00:31:37,291
yet they insist Ram is superior
'cause she happens

837
00:31:37,375 --> 00:31:38,541
to be the older one.

838
00:31:38,625 --> 00:31:40,416
It's scary how much nerve
the two of them have.

839
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,541
- While we're on the subject
of nerves,

840
00:31:42,625 --> 00:31:44,916
yours appears
quite impressive as well,

841
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,458
if I do say so.

842
00:31:47,416 --> 00:31:49,083
- Damn, I'm dizzy
from that bath.

843
00:31:49,166 --> 00:31:50,708
Stupid Roswaal.

844
00:31:50,791 --> 00:31:52,541
[screams]

845
00:31:53,125 --> 00:31:55,458
- Would you mind covering up
that sorry thing?

846
00:31:55,541 --> 00:31:57,333
- Hey, what are you doing here?

847
00:31:57,416 --> 00:31:58,791
- I was just waiting to help

848
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:00,916
Lord Roswaal
put on fresh clothes.

849
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,833
While I'm sure you
were looking forward to it,

850
00:32:02,916 --> 00:32:04,958
I'm sorry to say that
I finished my bath,

851
00:32:05,041 --> 00:32:06,791
so I won't be changing.
- As if!

852
00:32:06,875 --> 00:32:08,083
I wasn't thinking
about that at all!

853
00:32:08,166 --> 00:32:10,166
On top of that,
you spoil him too much.

854
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:12,125
Let him dress himself!
- Enough.

855
00:32:12,208 --> 00:32:14,791
I will not condone disrespect
toward Lord Roswaal.

856
00:32:14,875 --> 00:32:17,291
Next time I will use
a more forceful approach.

857
00:32:17,375 --> 00:32:19,500
- Easy.
Don't stir the hornet's nest.

858
00:32:19,583 --> 00:32:22,333
- By the way, Barusu,
do you have plans after this?

859
00:32:22,416 --> 00:32:24,625
- No, not really.
I'm just going to sleep.

860
00:32:24,708 --> 00:32:26,291
- Then please wait
in your room for me.

861
00:32:26,375 --> 00:32:27,833
I'll come by later.

862
00:32:28,708 --> 00:32:29,791
- Huh?

863
00:32:29,875 --> 00:32:31,458
Easy.
She didn't mean anything by it.

864
00:32:31,541 --> 00:32:33,500
Clear your mind.
Mili's the only one for you.

865
00:32:33,583 --> 00:32:34,666
Calm down.
Calm down!

866
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:37,166
One smiling Mili.
Two smiling Milis.

867
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:38,958
Three smiling Milis.

868
00:32:39,041 --> 00:32:42,291
Am I in Heaven?
- You're far too noisy, Barusu.

869
00:32:42,375 --> 00:32:44,125
It's nighttime.
You need to be quiet now.

870
00:32:44,208 --> 00:32:45,500
- [whimpers]

871
00:32:46,416 --> 00:32:48,625
- Barusu, come over here.

872
00:32:48,708 --> 00:32:50,541
- Wait, my heart's already
set on someone

873
00:32:50,625 --> 00:32:52,125
and her name is Mili!

874
00:32:52,208 --> 00:32:53,583
- What are you talking about?

875
00:32:53,666 --> 00:32:55,708
I'm telling you that you need
to sit over here

876
00:32:55,791 --> 00:32:57,208
so I can teach you how
to read and write.

877
00:32:57,291 --> 00:32:58,791
- That's what you wanted?

878
00:32:59,333 --> 00:33:00,875
So where's this coming from?

879
00:33:00,958 --> 00:33:02,666
- I could tell by watching you

880
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:04,375
that you're
completely illiterate.

881
00:33:04,458 --> 00:33:07,500
If you can't read or write,
then I can't send you shopping.

882
00:33:07,583 --> 00:33:09,791
It also means you can't
take down orders.

883
00:33:09,875 --> 00:33:12,708
We'll start with
some children's fairy tales.

884
00:33:12,791 --> 00:33:13,833
Beginning tonight,

885
00:33:13,916 --> 00:33:15,708
I'll help you study
every evening.

886
00:33:15,791 --> 00:33:18,458
- Thanks, but why are you being
so nice to me?

887
00:33:18,541 --> 00:33:20,041
- Well, why do you think?

888
00:33:20,125 --> 00:33:22,166
So I can--no, wait.

889
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,916
It makes things easier for me.
- You're correcting yourself?

890
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,416
You're never out of character.

891
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,791
- It's rather obvious.

892
00:33:27,875 --> 00:33:30,125
The more you're able to do
and handle on your own,

893
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:31,958
the less I have
to do around here,

894
00:33:32,041 --> 00:33:33,375
and when I have less to do,

895
00:33:33,458 --> 00:33:35,583
that means Rem's workload
is lighter also.

896
00:33:35,666 --> 00:33:37,666
So it's a total win-win.
- Look, I get it,

897
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:40,250
but that leaves me
with piles of work, though!

898
00:33:40,333 --> 00:33:42,708
- We'll start
with the basic i-glyphs.

899
00:33:42,791 --> 00:33:44,708
After that, we'll move on
to ro-glyphs

900
00:33:44,791 --> 00:33:45,875
and ha-glyphs.

901
00:33:45,958 --> 00:33:47,375
- There are three
different types?

902
00:33:47,458 --> 00:33:49,083
Just hearing that
is depressing.

903
00:33:49,166 --> 00:33:51,833
- You don't have time to waste
on silly doodles.

904
00:33:51,916 --> 00:33:54,833
We have an early start tomorrow
so we're short on time.

905
00:33:54,916 --> 00:33:56,291
I'm sleepy, too.

906
00:33:56,375 --> 00:33:58,666
- You know, can't say I dislike
how you manage to slip in

907
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:00,583
your own feelings about this
at the end of that thought.

908
00:34:00,666 --> 00:34:02,166
- In my own humble opinion,

909
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:04,500
I believe honesty
is my most charming feature.

910
00:34:04,583 --> 00:34:06,250
Now then,
let's get started.

911
00:34:09,416 --> 00:34:10,708
- So monotonous,

912
00:34:10,791 --> 00:34:12,791
I feel a Gestaltzerfall
phenomenon coming on.

913
00:34:13,041 --> 00:34:15,541
But still, even if you did
teach me to read and write

914
00:34:15,625 --> 00:34:18,166
just to make your life easier,
it made me happy.

915
00:34:18,541 --> 00:34:20,416
Honestly, I was beginning
to get the feeling

916
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,125
you just didn't like me
that much,

917
00:34:22,208 --> 00:34:24,250
and I'll probably cause
even more problems for you

918
00:34:24,333 --> 00:34:26,583
down the line,
but I'll try to become useful

919
00:34:26,666 --> 00:34:30,750
as soon as I...
- [breathing heavily]

920
00:34:30,833 --> 00:34:31,916
- [grunts]

921
00:34:35,708 --> 00:34:36,791
- Oh, wow.

922
00:34:36,875 --> 00:34:38,416
It actually turned out perfect.

923
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,166
Guess my sewing skills

924
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:42,125
aren't gonna be needed
this time around, huh?

925
00:34:42,208 --> 00:34:43,708
- Your sewing skills?

926
00:34:43,791 --> 00:34:45,083
If you excel at it,

927
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:46,583
I assume you enjoy it, then?

928
00:34:46,666 --> 00:34:47,791
- Yeah, kinda.

929
00:34:47,875 --> 00:34:49,791
By the way,
it looks like Ros and Mili

930
00:34:49,875 --> 00:34:51,500
have quite a few outfits
to choose from,

931
00:34:51,583 --> 00:34:53,875
but I don't really see any
for you or Ram.

932
00:34:53,958 --> 00:34:55,708
Want me to sew some for you?

933
00:34:55,791 --> 00:34:57,083
I'll take your measurements.

934
00:34:57,166 --> 00:34:58,416
- That's not necessary.

935
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,791
The uniforms my sister
and I wear daily

936
00:35:00,875 --> 00:35:02,666
are all that we need.
- Seriously?

937
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:05,125
How can you have nothing
but those uniforms?

938
00:35:05,208 --> 00:35:06,583
You own no other clothes?

939
00:35:06,666 --> 00:35:09,000
- It makes things much easier
when there are guests here

940
00:35:09,083 --> 00:35:12,125
in the mansion or when we're
with Lord Roswaal on business.

941
00:35:12,208 --> 00:35:14,583
Doing so eliminates the need
to explain our place

942
00:35:14,666 --> 00:35:16,750
in the hierarchy which makes it
very logical.

943
00:35:16,833 --> 00:35:19,500
- Well, I'm not talking
about being logical here.

944
00:35:19,583 --> 00:35:22,083
What I'm trying to say is that
a couple of cute girls like you

945
00:35:22,166 --> 00:35:23,958
and your sister ought
