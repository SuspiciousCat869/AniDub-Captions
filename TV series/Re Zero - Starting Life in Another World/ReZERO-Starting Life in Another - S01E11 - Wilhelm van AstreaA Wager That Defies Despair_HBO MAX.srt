Staying close together

and then I became a knight.

Well, congratulations.

It puts you one step closer
to your dream, right?

- Dream?

- You wield a sword to protect,
don't you?

351

After all, a knight's someone

- Fine. I won't come here again.

00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,583
- With a face like yours,

372
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:21,291
there's no reason
you should be holding a sword.

373
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,166
- I'm the Master Swordsman.

374
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:28,083
I didn't understand
the reason why at first,

375
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:29,708
but now I do.

376
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:32,500
- What do you mean, the reason?

377
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,041
- Wielding a sword
to protect someone,

378
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:38,916
honestly that sounds nice
to me, too.

379
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:44,041
- Listen to me, Theresia.

380
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:46,916
I'm gonna take
your sword away from you,

381
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,791
and I don't care about the role

382
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:51,416
that was bestowed upon you,
understand?

383
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,125
The art of wielding a sword
is beautiful!

Don't ever look down
on that beauty...

Where is Wilhelm?

If you remember it,

doesn't it

If this creature is actually

we won't last long,

but we've come way too far

You mean Ricardo's still alive?

for healing
just in the nick of time.

gouged out convinced me.

529
00:28:25,125 --> 00:28:26,416
Your group's
been engaging it head-on,

530
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,875
so you must have sensed it.

- I was absorbed in battle,
but now that you mention it,

532

I think you're right.

533
00:28:32,208 --> 00:28:34,666
- I do agree with
the conjecture that this one

534
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:36,916
is weaker than the original one
we faced earlier,

535
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,625
but what good does knowing
that bit of information do?

536
00:28:38,708 --> 00:28:41,875
There are three White Whales
to contend with.

537
00:28:41,958 --> 00:28:44,375
Destroying them will be
much easier said than done.

538
00:28:44,458 --> 00:28:47,125
- Well, luckily we don't need
to kill all three of 'em.

539
00:28:47,208 --> 00:28:49,125
I think only one
should be enough.

540
00:28:49,208 --> 00:28:49,916
That bastard's been making

541
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,916
its two doubles
do all the fighting.

542
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,958
Meanwhile it's
just hanging around high up

543
00:28:54,041 --> 00:28:55,125
and watching from a distance.

544
00:28:55,208 --> 00:28:58,250
What do you think
it's really doing up there?

545
00:28:58,958 --> 00:29:01,375
- You mean that's the real one?

546
00:29:01,458 --> 00:29:03,833
- It won't come down,
because it knows if it does,

547
00:29:03,916 --> 00:29:05,333
it'll be in danger
of being killed.

- [sword rattles]

549

But I can't rely on my

to hit from this
distance.

550
00:29:12,416 --> 00:29:15,458
If I had one strike,
it might be possible, but...

and I'd hate to consider
the odds of success.

brought down the White Whale."

To be perfectly honest,
it isn't in my nature

to be modest.

In fact, I believe
a reward's in order,

753
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:17,708

express my gratitude.

It's not really
about loyalty or allegiance,

lies exactly where it should.

but hearing it
still stings a bit.

763
00:40:47,041 --> 00:40:48,791
- I think you're truly
an amazing person.

764
00:40:48,875 --> 00:40:49,916
And you know what?

765
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,166
If I'd been on my own,

766
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:53,625
I probably would have
accepted your offer.

767
00:40:53,708 --> 00:40:56,166
But I'll be counting on you
to uphold the alliance,

768
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:58,166
and even if we both
end up as enemies,

769
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:01,708
I believe we can get along
until that moment comes, so...

770
00:41:01,791 --> 00:41:02,500
what do you say?

771
00:41:03,916 --> 00:41:04,625
- Subaru Natsuki,

772
00:41:04,708 --> 00:41:07,166
allow me to correct
one idea you have.

773

- Eh?

774
00:41:08,125 --> 00:41:10,666
- If we find ourselves
in conflict one day,

775
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:14,875
I promise that I will continue
to remain friendly towards you.

776
00:41:14,958 --> 00:41:16,208
Even if the time comes

777
00:41:16,291 --> 00:41:18,208
and we must settle things
once and for all,

778
00:41:18,291 --> 00:41:21,541
I will not forget the great debt
I have incurred to you this day.

779
00:41:21,625 --> 00:41:24,458
Therefore, even if
we do become enemies,

780
00:41:24,541 --> 00:41:27,000
my respect for you
will never fade nor falter,

781
00:41:27,083 --> 00:41:29,291
and I will continue
to show you favor 'til the end.

already have a number one

784
00:41:38,708 --> 00:41:39,458
and number two
firmly placed in my heart,

785
00:41:39,541 --> 00:41:41,958
that would have been
a pretty close call.

- [chuckles]

I haven't gone so far
as to think of you

788
00:41:45,291 --> 00:41:48,041
in the way some women might.

789
00:41:48,125 --> 00:41:49,958
I don't deny
there were occasions

790
00:41:50,041 --> 00:41:51,583
where my sentiments
felt a pull.

791
00:41:51,666 --> 00:41:54,500
But as for my heart,
it lies at the end of my dream.

792
00:41:59,833 --> 00:42:01,875
- [chuckles]

793
00:42:03,666 --> 00:42:06,500
- Now then, I'll be leaving
for the capital

794
00:42:06,583 --> 00:42:07,416
to take our wounded in
for proper treatment

795
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:10,750
and to present
the White Whale's carcass.

796
00:42:10,833 --> 00:42:12,291
But from the sound of things,

797
00:42:12,375 --> 00:42:14,833
it would seem that you
still
have a duty to attend
to.

798
00:42:14,916 --> 00:42:17,791
- Yeah, I do. It may seem rude,
but in a sense,

799
00:42:17,875 --> 00:42:18,541
that's what
this whole whale-hunt thing

800
00:42:18,625 --> 00:42:20,541
was all about
in the first place.

801
00:42:20,625 --> 00:42:23,875
- Is that so? You mean
the White Whale was secondary?

802
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:25,416
That sounds intriguing.

803
00:42:26,416 --> 00:42:27,625
Do you need assistance?

804
00:42:27,708 --> 00:42:29,708
- You bet I do. Take a look.

805
00:42:29,791 --> 00:42:35,000
Frankly, I didn't think it
would
take this kind of toll on us.

806
00:42:35,083 --> 00:42:37,291
- And on top of--
- If that's the case,

807
00:42:37,375 --> 00:42:40,333
then why not make use
of this old man before you?

810
00:42:46,375 --> 00:42:47,291
you have my deepest gratitude.

811
00:42:47,375 --> 00:42:49,375
It was because of you
and your plan

812
00:42:49,458 --> 00:42:52,750
that I was able to take part
in this subjugation

813
00:42:52,833 --> 00:42:55,291
and carry out my reason
for living all this time.

814
00:42:55,375 --> 00:42:58,125
I thank you. I thank you.

815
00:42:59,583 --> 00:43:03,125
From the bottom of my heart,
I humbly thank you.

816

- [gasps]

817
00:43:07,083 --> 00:43:08,833
Actually it was
your own strength

818
00:43:08,916 --> 00:43:10,208
that made it possible, Wilhelm.

819
00:43:10,291 --> 00:43:11,500
You're what inspired me
to defeat the White Whale

820
00:43:11,583 --> 00:43:15,208
and to keep on fighting
without giving up.

821
00:43:15,291 --> 00:43:17,333
I don't know if it's okay
to say it like this,

822
00:43:17,416 --> 00:43:20,000
but congratulations.

823
00:43:20,083 --> 00:43:22,250
And I want to thank you
for your service.

824
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:24,333
I believe you were
able to do this

825
00:43:24,416 --> 00:43:26,750
because you loved your wife
that much.

826
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:30,666
Forever, sir.

827
00:43:35,625 --> 00:43:38,166
- If you want my opinion,
I think you should hold on

828
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:40,000
to that treasured sword
for a while.

829

In these times, being unarmed
will do you little good.

830
00:43:42,208 --> 00:43:44,666
- Right. Thank you, Milady.

831
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:46,000

832
00:43:46,083 --> 00:43:48,375
and half of the uninjured
soldiers with you.

833
00:43:48,458 --> 00:43:50,083
There should be
about 20 of them.

- Are you sure?

835
00:43:51,125 --> 00:43:52,833
- Like I said before,

836
00:43:52,916 --> 00:43:54,416
I don't want to be shameless.

837
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:56,208
I respect you, remember?

838
00:43:58,291 --> 00:43:59,125

839
00:43:59,208 --> 00:44:00,791
I truly appreciate it.

I mean, it's not like

I can't allow you
to push yourself any further.

You need to stay behind

00:44:20,083 --> 00:44:21,833
Stay here,
and do as Felix says.

850
00:44:21,916 --> 00:44:23,833
You shouldn't overdo it
in your condition.

00:44:23,916 --> 00:44:24,916
- No, I won't.

00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,333
It hurts too much.

00:44:26,416 --> 00:44:27,791
I can't bear it.

When you're in trouble,

00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:31,250
I want to be the first
to reach out to you,

856
00:44:31,333 --> 00:44:32,916
to help you
with whatever you need.

857
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,375
That's the promise
I made to you,

858
00:44:34,458 --> 00:44:36,833
and I intend to keep it,
so please...

859
00:44:36,916 --> 00:44:38,791
- In that case,
you don't have to worry.

860
00:44:38,875 --> 00:44:39,875
- [gasps]

861
00:44:39,958 --> 00:44:43,250

so many times already.

- [gasps]

863
00:44:45,083 --> 00:44:47,083
- Don't you realize
how much you've done for me

864
00:44:47,166 --> 00:44:49,291
over and over again
up to this point?

865
00:44:49,375 --> 00:44:51,500
I want you to help me
from now on, too,

866
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:55,458
so just leave everything to me,
all right?

867
00:44:56,625 --> 00:44:58,416
And you'll still
keep me by your side,

868
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:00,166
no matter where you go
from now on?

869
00:45:00,250 --> 00:45:02,875
- Hey, come on.

870
00:45:02,958 --> 00:45:04,916
I'm the one who should be
begging you to do that.

871
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,208
- [laughs]

872
00:45:08,375 --> 00:45:10,916
I'll take that as a promise.

873
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,083
Can't back out now, Subaru.

I'll find a way
to take care of everything,

so you don't have to worry.

878
00:45:22,375 --> 00:45:24,541
I'm your hero,
and that's what heroes do.

879
00:45:24,625 --> 00:45:27,750
I've made up my mind, and I'm
ready to take that first step,

880
00:45:27,833 --> 00:45:29,458
so just relax,
and leave it to me.

I managed to pull off
the whale hunt, now, didn't I?

Your hero's feeling
demonically inspired,

883
00:45:34,125 --> 00:45:36,125
so the world should stand back.

884
00:45:36,208 --> 00:45:38,041

885
00:45:42,916 --> 00:45:44,875
Right.

886
00:45:44,958 --> 00:45:46,500
My hero is the greatest,

887
00:45:46,583 --> 00:45:48,458
the best in the world.

You really got

all the good parts
back there, didn't you?

Well, way to go, kid.
Nice work.

Mimi, too! Mimi, too!

Praise me, too!

Didn't you almost die?

Also your brother
was totally exhausted

How in the world do you
still have so much energy?

900
00:46:24,916 --> 00:46:26,041
- Hetaro's just a baby.

901
00:46:26,125 --> 00:46:27,166
He's weak and frail.

902

- [sighs]
- Honestly, it's so pathetic.

903
00:46:28,708 --> 00:46:30,333
- I know
I didn't get much action

904
00:46:30,416 --> 00:46:32,916
in doing battle with that whale,

905
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,083
but you don't
have to worry about a thing.

SUBARU: The real battle?

What exactly are you
trying to get at?

- Wait. What?

919
00:46:59,375 --> 00:47:02,375
This half of the crew
was sent to block the road

920
00:47:02,458 --> 00:47:04,000
and keep the battleground
free of civilians

the whale.

are gonna help us, too?

That sounds awesome.
So who's leading them?

- My younger brother Tivey.

I can't wait
for you to meet him.

I'm really curious to find out

whether he's more like you
or Hetaro.
