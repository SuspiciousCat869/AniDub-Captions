- And why are you
dressed up like that?

- No! I've already failed!
- [laughing]

- Recognized just three seconds
into my mission!

27
00:01:32,791 --> 00:01:35,500
- What's a "mission," anyway?

28
00:01:35,583 --> 00:01:37,166
- What does "top secret" mean?
- Come on!

- Think I just peed my pants!

- Can't you see
I'm busy right now! Go away!

31
00:01:40,916 --> 00:01:44,208
You better not butt in during
the actual date! You hear me?!

32
00:01:44,291 --> 00:01:47,625
- So what's a "date"?
I've never heard of that before.

33
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:49,250
- A date
is a secret, awesome time

00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:52,333

for two people who are in love!

"pleasurable embarrassment"?

Well, we've got
a cool secret, too, you know!

- With the royal selection
now upon us,

this timing
is most unfortunate.

It appears
that something quite troubling

00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:59,416

Subaru?

68
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:39,500
- I'm fine. Thank you, Rem.

69
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:41,583
Hang on a minute!

70
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:43,250
What are you doing in my room?!

71
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:45,250
- I have some time
before my work begins,

72
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:46,000
so I was just gazing
at your face.

73
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:49,250
It's to help get my spirits up.

74
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:50,083
- What does that mean, exactly?

75
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:53,666
- Anyway, what were
you dreaming about?

76
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,708
- It's the sort of thing
that would become real

77
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:57,458
if I were to tell you,

78
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:58,750
so just forget it.

79
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:00,708
[shivers] Aw, man.

80
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:02,208
It's kind of chilly today, huh?

81
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:05,791
- It is, yes. This morning
does seem unusually brisk.

82
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:08,791
How very perceptive of you,
Subaru.

83
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:12,041
- Uh, anyone could tell
that it's cold right now.

84
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:13,125
[lid rattling]

85
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:16,333
I mean, yesterday
it was so hot outside

86
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:18,250
that I couldn't stop sweating
the whole day,

87
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:21,125
so I'd say this is
one heck of a temperature drop.

88
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:26,916
Don't you have
a uniform for cold weather?

89
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,333
'Cause you've gotta be
freezing in that thing.

90
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:31,583
- When the Glacial Period
starts in earnest,

91
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:34,083
then I'll begin wearing
my outfit for the cold.

92
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:36,916
It's made from a thick fabric
and lined with heavy cotton,

93
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,666
so it's very cozy.

94
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:39,333
- Hmm.

95
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:41,708
Wouldn't you be better off

96
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:44,875
in your "Glacial Period" outfit
for times like these?

97
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:46,833
If you don't feel comfortable
bringing it up,

98
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:49,333
I have no problem
asking Roz about it for you.

99
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:52,250
- Don't worry. My sister and I
are used to this.

100
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:55,458
It's nothing worth
troubling Master Roswaal over.

101
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:58,416
- Okay, then. If you say
you'll be all right...

102
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:02,791
Uh, so where
is your sister, anyway?

103
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:05,708
- She said it was a bit
too shivery to get out of bed,

104
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:07,500
so she decided
to sleep in a little.

105
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:08,541
- Didn't you just tell me

106
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:10,500
that you were both
used to weather like this?!

107
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:12,375
Well, I've heard enough!

108
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:13,916
We gotta go up there
and tell her

109
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,583
that live-in servants
don't get to sleep late,

110
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:16,875
regardless of what the
temperature might be outside!

111
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:19,166
- [door opens]
- Come on, Rem!

112
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:22,166
- But she's exhausted from
her daily responsibilities,

113
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,875
so I don't think
some extra sleep would really--

114
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:24,875
- Come on, Rem!

115
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:28,041
- Right! If you insist, Subaru.

119
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:43,500
Just look at all the dust
that you missed. Now try again.

120
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:44,666
You truly are useless, Barusu.

121
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,833
- Listen, I know you didn't
like being dragged out of bed,

122
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:49,958
but how long are you
planning on holding a grudge?

123
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:52,041
Stop being mad, already.

124
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:52,625
[yelps]

125
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:54,500
Huh?

126
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:55,125
Ram, look.

127
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:58,041
I think I found a secret door.

128
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:00,833
Do you have any idea
what's in there?

129
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:01,833
- Not at all.

130
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:02,875
[floorboard rattling]

131
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:04,750
Stop that, Barusu.

132
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:07,583
What if a swarm of bugs
flies out the moment it opens?

133
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:10,375
You should wait until I've left
the room and locked the door.

134
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:11,250
- And why would you
need to lock it?

135
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:14,083
Anyway, it's too late
for that right now.

136
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,000
[gasps]

137
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:17,750
Oh, man.

138
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:19,875
This looks
like quite a collection.

139
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:21,750
So is all of it alcohol?

140
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:23,625
- Come to think of it,
I've heard stories

141
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:25,041
about Master Roswaal's
grandmother

142
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:26,958
being a rather heavy drinker.

143
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:28,291
I would bet they've been
down here for a while, then.

144
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:31,916
- Whoa.
Since Roz's granny was around?

145
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,041
It's hard to even picture that.

146
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:36,333
But if this stuff
really is that old,

147
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:38,041
then it's gotta be worth
a fortune by now, right?

148
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:40,833
- I know you struggle
with everything,

149
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:43,541
but you mustn't drink them
without permission, Barusu.

150
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:43,875
- I wasn't gonna!

151
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:45,625
EMILIA: Oh.

152
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:46,875
Subaru! Ram!

153
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:47,791
- Eh?

154
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:50,500
- I wondered what
those rummaging noises were.

155
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:51,625
I guess it was you two.

156
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:53,500
- [gasps]

157
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:54,375
[joyful] Hello, Mili!

158
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:57,541
- So what are you both
doing in here, huh?

159
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,833
- I was warning Barusu that no
matter how painful his life is,

160
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:02,541
alcohol is never the answer.

161
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:03,708
- Oh, really?

162
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:05,916
Subaru, if you
were suffering that much,

163
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,458
then you should have told me.

164
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:08,291
- No! You've got it all wrong!

165
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:09,958
I'm not drinking away
my problems.

166
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:11,333
In fact, I'm still underage,

167
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:14,833
so I'm too young
to do that, anyway!

168
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:17,208
I still have a hard time
getting on adult websites.

169
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:18,708
- That's strange.

170
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:20,166
I don't think I've ever heard
of one of those before.

171
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,166
But anyway, here in Lugunica,

172
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:25,083
the legal drinking age
is 15 years old.

173
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:26,833
- What?
- Incidentally,

174
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:28,666
if getting
on these adult websites

175
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,166
is something
that's important to you,

176
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,000
I'll do what I can to help you
with it as much as possible.

177
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:34,000
- You're the sweetest! E.M.A.!

178
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:36,500
Emilia, major angel! [laughs]

179
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:40,041
But an angel like you shouldn't
be saying stuff like that.

180
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:42,750
Uh, by the way, Mili,
do you like drinking?

181
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:45,833
A tipsy version of you
would be adorable!

182
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:48,416
- Sorry. I'm not quite sure
what you're saying,

183
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,208
but if it's about alcohol,
I've never had it before.

184
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:52,166
- That's too bad!

185
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,625
With drinks, our date tomorrow

186
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:55,708
would be more
like the kind adults go on.

187
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:57,583
A glass or two, some flow--

188
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:59,791
Whoops. Don't wanna spoil
the surprise, now, do I?

189
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:00,875
- [gasps]

190
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:02,791
That's right.

191
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:04,458
Tomorrow's our date, isn't it?

192
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:07,041
- Yup! And I can't tell you
how excited I am!

193
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:09,208
I'll get up early
and pack lunch for us, okay?!

194
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:12,000
- Oh, really?
I'll look forward to that, then!

195
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:13,666
- Hope the sun comes out
and it gets warmer.

196
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,708
- [giggles]

197
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:17,791
- And speaking of the weather,

198
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:19,500
aren't you cold in that outfit?

199
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:22,875
- Huh? Uh, no, I don't
feel cold in the slightest!

200
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:25,916
If anything, it's quite toasty.

201
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,166
- Is everything all right?

202
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,625
You're acting kinda weird.

203
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,916
- Well, I have some things
I need to take care of.

204
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,166
They came up really suddenly.
Bye!

205
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:32,708
[whoosh]

206
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:38,041
- [scoffs] The things
she needs to do

207
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:41,083
are simply trivial matters
and not even worth mentioning.

208
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:42,041
So in other words,

209
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:43,875
you mean even less to her
than those, Barusu.

210
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:45,791
- What?! No.

211
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:47,166
Uh, it's more like, you know,

212
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,750
she's probably
so excited about our date

213
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:51,000
that she's feeling
all flustered now and can't--

214
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:52,750
[wind blowing]

215
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,083
[grunts]

216
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:55,875
Canteen, check.

217
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:56,916
Bread basket, check.

218
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,291
Date schedule, check.

219
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:00,000
Handkerchief, check.

220
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:01,833
Lucky boxers, check.

221
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:04,000
And...

222
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:07,291
Got the alarm all set.

223
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:07,708
Perfect.

224
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:15,333
[grunts]

225
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:16,750
[sighs]

226
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:17,958
No use. I can't sleep.

227
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:19,750
All right, in that case...

228
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:22,125
There's one Puck

229
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:24,416
and two Pucks
and three Pucks...

230
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:28,958
Wait. I'm getting
some intense déjà vu.

231
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:31,083
This has
definitely happened before.

232
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:32,208
It was the night
that I was cursed.

233
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:34,833
I can't use Puck, then!

234
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:36,250
Talk about bad luck.

235
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:38,125
So in that case...

236
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:39,625
There's one Mili

237
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:42,291
and two Milis
and three Milis.

238
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:43,750
It's fantastic!

239
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,208
[groans] But I've
done this before, too!

240
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:47,333
It's time for me to innovate,

241
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:50,125
take things in a new direction.

242
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:53,000
One Roswaal and two Roswaals

243
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:54,875
and three Roswaals
and four Ros...

244
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:58,041
[sighs]

245
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,208
How is our date
even gonna have a chance

246
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:03,333
if it's still this cold outside?

247
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:05,541
I'm really hoping
the flower field that Petra

248
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:07,833
and the other kids showed me
hasn't died already.

249
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:11,041
No. The weather
will be nice tomorrow.

250
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:12,125
It'll be fine.

251
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:14,666
I've gotta believe that.

252
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:18,125
[organ music playing]

253
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:32,208
- [alarm ringtone playing]
- Eh?

254
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:33,416
It's freezing!

255
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,041
We'll die in this!

256
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:39,041
[door creaks]

257
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:40,916
Feels like
it's gotten even colder

258
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,708
than it was just yesterday,
so what's going on here?

259
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:45,708
Huh?

260
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:48,833
- Beatrice?
- [gasps]

261
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:52,291
- Why are you up
this early in the morning?

262
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:54,000
- N-No reason at all!

263
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:55,625
Stop snooping, I suppose!

264
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:57,333
- Anyway, it's insanely cold.
- Hmph!

265
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:58,916
- I have a date with Mili today,

266
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,166
but do I even have a shot
if it's like this?

267
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,875
- I wouldn't know
anything about that.

268
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:04,708
And besides,
I'm exceptionally busy,

269
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:06,875
so I have no time
to play around, I suppose.

270
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:09,791
- Well, it's not as if I was
asking you to play with me.

271
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:10,625
Regardless,
it's easy to catch a cold

272
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:13,416
when the seasons change,
so be careful--

273
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,750
- I'm not so weak

274
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:16,541
that I need someone like you
to worry about me.

275
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:18,750
- Oh, no, it's not you.
It's Rem I'd feel bad for

276
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:21,083
if you were to get sick.
She'd have to make you porridge,

277
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:23,250
and then she might
not be able to find you at all.

278
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:24,291
So if you come down with
something, try and behave, okay?

279
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:26,375
- Now, why should I
be criticized

280
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:27,875
over a hypothetical story

281
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:29,791
with a hypothetical ending,
I suppose?!

282
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:31,083
In any case, I'm very busy,

283
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:33,250
so don't make me
repeat myself, I suppose!

284
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:34,708
-<i> Buon giorno!</i>

285
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:40,083
- So the date you were looking
forward to with Miss Emilia

286
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:42,083
had to be canceled?

287
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:43,583
- Not canceled, just postponed.

288
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:47,166
This nasty weather
would have ruined it, anyway.

289
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,250
And she said...

290
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:50,875
-<i> Good idea! Mm, I agree!</i>

291
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:52,083
<i>I think we should postpone it!</i>
<i>It's so cold after all!</i>

292
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:53,458
<i>I know you've been really</i>
<i>excited about the whole thing</i>

293
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:55,958
<i>and I made</i>
<i>a promise to you, but--</i>

294
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:57,958
<i>Oh! Of course, it's not only</i>
<i>because I promised you I'd go.</i>

295
00:11:58,041 --> 00:11:59,791
<i>In fact, I was sort of</i>
<i>looking forward to it myself,</i>

296
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:01,583
<i>but if it's this chilly,</i>
<i>then we don't have a choice.</i>

297
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:06,083
- Though it kinda bugs me
that she came off

298
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:08,958
as just a little bit relieved
about the whole thing, you know?

299
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:09,833
- I think
it was a wise decision.

300
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:12,458
If you two found yourself
stranded out there

301
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:13,875
and the worst happened...

302
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:16,458
- It's not like we're
on some snowy mountaintop.

303
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:18,166
Wait a minute!
Maybe that's what this is!

304
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,291
- What what is?

305
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:21,458
- We get trapped in a blizzard

306
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:22,833
and take shelter in a hut,

307
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:25,291
where we keep each other warm
with our body heat!

308
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:27,958
A pleasurably
embarrassing situation!

309
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:29,083
- Right! I understand!

310
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:30,750
You can count on me
to keep you warm!

311
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,791
- Think you've got this story's
characters mixed up!

312
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:36,083
But still,
it's not like a blizzard

313
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:37,291
would hit so suddenly.

314
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:40,041
Besides, there's no way
it's gonna get that cold.

315
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:41,250
- [laughs]
- [slush crunches]

316
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:43,041
Uh...

317
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:45,500
it just made a crunching sound.

318
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:47,041
- Yes. It would seem

319
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:49,458
that some of the water
in the bucket has frozen.

320
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:51,250
- Huh?

321
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:54,333
- [ice crackling]
- [sputtering]

322
00:12:58,208 --> 00:12:59,791
[wood creaking]

323
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:01,500
Okay, something's
obviously going on here!

324
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:04,041
- [cup rattling]
- [shivering]

325
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:08,500
- I'm sorry! I should have
come to help warm you up,

326
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:11,166
but there was no way that I
could leave my sister alone.

327
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:14,125
- W-Were you
k-keeping each other warm?

328
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:16,375
J-Just imagining that
has b-brought

329
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:18,208
my body temperature up
by about th-three degrees.

330
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:19,708
ROSWAAL: Oh, my, Subaru!

331
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:23,250
You don't seem well.
Whatever is the matter?

332
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:26,083
- Well, what do you think?!
It's super freakin' cold!

333
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:28,375
This goes beyond
natural climate extremes!

334
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:31,666
- Goodness, I didn't think
you had such a faint heart.

335
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,958
If you keep your mind and body
in optimal condition,

336
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:37,541
you'll find you can remain
calm, no matter how cool it--

337
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:38,416
- That's not very convincing
coming from someone

338
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,208
dressed
in as many layers as you!

339
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:43,625
I'll develop homicidal
tendencies at this rate!

340
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:44,583
[sputters]

341
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:46,875
- [sneezes]
- I see.

342
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:50,041
Yes, we may indeed
be reaching our limit.

343
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:52,166
- The way you just said that,

344
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,041
do you know
more than you're letting on?

345
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,166
If it's General Winter
causing this,

346
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:56,750
let's go defeat him,

347
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:58,541
like, as soon as possible!

348
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:00,500
Help me out, Sensei! [sneezes]

349
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:02,541
- Do you have
a rather difficult time

350
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:04,416
handling
the cold weather, then?

351
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,750
- I complain when it
gets cold in the winter

352
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:09,125
and then in the summer
when it gets too hot,

353
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:10,833
also when
I'm sleepy in spring

354
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:12,750
and when matsutake mushrooms
are expensive in the fall,

355
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:15,625
like any other ordinary person,
you know?

356
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:16,958
[sneezes]

357
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:19,333
- Curious about the outside?

358
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:22,083
- Well, yeah, of course I am.

359
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:23,541
If it's snowing, I'm worried
about the village fields

360
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:25,875
and how they'll
clear it all away.

361
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:28,583
- You are indeed quite convivial
with the villagers,

362
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:31,416
especially the little children,
aren't you?

363
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,583
- Just by chance, though.

364
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:35,625
I don't actually
like kids very much.

365
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,083
As far as I'm concerned,

366
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:38,916
they're too selfish
and impulsive.

367
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,291
But they like me,
so I don't have much choice.

368
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:42,541
- Right, right.

369
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:44,291
I believe this is
what you call<i> tsundere.</i>

370
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:45,416
- Sniffle!

371
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,250
Aah! My nose is killing me!

372
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:49,375
Sniffle, sniffle!

373
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:50,500
Oh, man, this sucks!

374
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:52,416
- Don't worry!
I'll be right here

375
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,583
to take care
of all your sniffles for you.

376
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:56,875
- Anyway, you can rest easy.

377
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:58,916
This chill isn't affecting
the villagers.

378
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,125
It is only occurring
around the mansion.

379
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:02,750
- Hang on! How in the hell
is that even possible?

380
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:06,416
- We have two beings here
who are working hard

381
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,291
to ensure that it doesn't
spread beyond this domain.

382
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:12,125
- Does he mean...

383
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:14,583
- It certainly
isn't my sister and me.

384
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:16,291
- I guess that narrows it down,
then, doesn't it?

385
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:18,500
- That, it does.

386
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:20,750
So when it comes
to what's causing all of this,

387
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:24,166
it would seem you don't need
further explanation.

388
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:32,583
Miss Emilia, forgive me
for the early disturbance.

389
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:35,291
Do you have a moment to spare?

390
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:37,333
EMILIA: Roswaal?!

391
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:37,958
I, um--

392
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:40,708
Hold on! Just a minute, okay?

393
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:42,250
- Go ahead, then.

394
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:44,041
- [grunts]

395
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,500
[yelps] What the hell?!
It's freezing!

396
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:51,416
Are you okay in there, Mili?

397
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,708
EMILIA: Huh? Wait!

398
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:55,208
Subaru's there, too?!

399
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:58,083
- Yeah, I am, but that
isn't the issue right now.

400
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,083
Don't you have
something else to say?!

401
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:01,375
EMILIA: Let's see.

402
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:02,541
I, uh...

403
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:05,083
Right. G-Good morning!

404
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:06,125
- Hmm, hmm.

405
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:08,416
What a good, classic,
polite greeting that was.

406
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,583
Wait! Never mind that!

407
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:11,125
I'm opening the door!

408
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:13,041
And if you happen
to be changing, thank you!

409
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:14,375
EMILIA: Don't you mean,
"Sorry"?!

410
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:17,708
- [wind gusting]
- [gasps]

411
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:19,041
It's freezing!

412
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:21,416
What the hell
is going on in here?!

413
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,666
- Y-You shouldn't
barge into someone's room

414
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,375
before they've given you
permission to do so!

415
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:27,125
You're being very rude!

416
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:30,375
[gasps] Yes! Incredibly rude!

417
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:32,791
You know, I mean...

418
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:34,458
you should--

419
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:36,541
Just start over, okay?!

420
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:39,041
- All right, then,
that would be Mili's suggestion,

421
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:41,541
but does the mansion's owner
have anything else to say?

422
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,500
- You may enter if you wish.

423
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,125
- Hey, Roswaal!

424
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:48,541
- Now what's the cause
of this intense weather?

425
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:49,583
- Cause? Wh-What do you
mean by "cause"?

426
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:51,666
It's not like it's a--

427
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:54,166
I mean, it's not--
well, not quite "not."

428
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,250
I don't know!

429
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:56,583
PUCK: It's okay, Lia.

430
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:58,250
At this point, I don't think

431
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:00,708
it'd be possible
for us to hide this, anyway.

432
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:02,791
[sighs] Puck,
you aren't any help at all.

433
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:05,583
And right when I
almost had him convinced.

434
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:07,208
- Yeah, another hundred years

435
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:08,541
wouldn't have gotten you
closer to that.

436
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:09,166
- Huh?

437
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:12,291
- [sighs] I'm really sorry,

438
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:14,333
'cause I'm the one
who's causing the trouble.

439
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:16,291
Don't be upset
with Lia or Betty, okay?

440
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:18,500
I mean, after all,

441
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:21,291
those two have just been
trying to look out for me.

442
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:25,708
SUBARU: Okay, so I'm confused.

443
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:28,750
What's a magic release period?

444
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:30,291
Like your mating season?

445
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:32,166
PUCK: I'm not an animal,
you know.

446
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,458
Spirits don't even
have those, anyway.

447
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:35,541
How rude of you.

448
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:39,041
- I have no idea
how to respond to that.

449
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:41,500
- The magic release period
is a phenomenon

450
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:43,708
that occurs
in those with powerful magic.

451
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:45,458
The strength of one's magic

452
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:47,625
is affected
by the nature of their od,

453
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:49,375
and that makes it
highly restrictive.

454
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:51,791
When you say "od," do you
mean something different

455
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:54,125
from magic and gates
and all that other stuff?

456
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:55,791
- I question your common sense

457
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:57,625
if you don't even know
that much.

458
00:17:57,708 --> 00:18:00,000
You're as simpleminded
as they come, Barusu.

459
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:03,166
- Man, you're even
more demeaning than usual today.

460
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:03,791
Can't handle the cold, huh?

461
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:06,166
- Weaknesses and strengths,

462
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,375
Either way,
it's all quite subjective.

463
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:09,875
And I refuse
to look at the world

464
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:11,500
in such a narrow manner.

465
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:14,291
Don't say things to make you
feel better about yourself.

466
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:15,375
Just die.

467
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:16,708
SUBARU: Well,
that escalated quickly!

468
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:18,166
- We'll never get anywhere

469
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:21,500
if we leave the explanation
up to you two, I suppose.

470
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:22,750
It's rather obvious to me

471
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:23,541
that I'll have
to take over from here.

472
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:26,500
So od is a vessel for magic,

473
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:29,500
and its purpose is to store
magic taken in through a gate.

474
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:32,541
- Oh, cool. It sounds
like a magic container.

475
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:34,166
Continue. Go on.

476
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,750
- The way you said that
irritates me.

477
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:37,833
Anyway,
the stronger one's od is,

478
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:41,000
the more magic
one can use, I suppose.

479
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:43,791
But every container has a limit
to how much it can hold.

480
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:47,125
And when one's od
reaches its limit,

481
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:49,000
the accumulated magic
overflows from it,

482
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:52,833
so it must be released
before that happens.

483
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:55,500
SUBARU: Being full
and wanting to get rid

484
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:56,375
of what's inside
before exploding?

485
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:58,333
- [sips]

486
00:18:58,416 --> 00:18:59,750
- Oh, like constipation.
- [wails]

487
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:01,791
Choose better words, I suppose!

488
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:04,666
- Think I got it.
So this entire thing

489
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,708
is just the result of Puck
letting out some excess mana.

490
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:10,250
- Yes, that's exactly right.

491
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:12,208
I'm sorry for not telling you.

492
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:13,916
- Pretty extreme way
to relieve being backed up.

493
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,458
Does this happen to you
very often?

494
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:19,458
- I'd say twice a year or so.

495
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:21,666
Back when I lived
in the forest with Lia,

496
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,708
I was able
to release it at any time,

497
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:25,916
but since coming here, I've had
to tone it down a little bit,

498
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,416
so I guess this is
the backlash from that.

499
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,791
- [giggles]
- Don't "hee hee hee hee" me!

500
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:34,083
I can't complain
if releasing your magic

501
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:36,708
is something you have to do,
but I'm still having trouble

502
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:39,541
understanding why things
became so intense this quickly.

503
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:42,250
- At first, I just let out
a little at a time,

504
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:45,750
but I had quite a bit more mana
stored up than I usually do,

505
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:48,666
and no one said anything
when it got cold, so I thought,

506
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,625
"Maybe I can get away
with a little more.

507
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:53,416
"Yes! I definitely can!

508
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,250
Good thing
they're simple-minded."

509
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:56,291
And here we are!

510
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:57,500
- SUBARU: What a sloppy job!
- [Puck chuckles]

511
00:19:57,583 --> 00:20:00,291
- For a great spirit
as powerful as Bubby,

512
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:02,916
this is something that he
can never truly be rid of.

513
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,916
Out of consideration
for how cute and fluffy he is,

514
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,458
you should stop
overreacting like this and...

515
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,500
SUBARU: See?
You're sniffling, too.

516
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:12,083
And since you figured you'd be
in trouble if you were caught,

517
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:14,083
I bet you were
trying to put up a barrier

518
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:16,750
to seal in the cold,
now, weren't you?

519
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:18,541
And I want you
to be honest with me.

520
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:20,375
- [snorts]
- Look! She's blowing her nose!

521
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:23,625
- I haven't the slightest idea
what you're talking about.

522
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:29,125
Listen. As for Puck and me,
we truly feel awful

523
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:32,541
for letting things
get out of hand like this.

524
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:36,625
Sorry. But the magic release
period should be over soon.

525
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:38,416
Right, Puck? Tell them.

526
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,916
- Yeah! With the way
things are heading now,

527
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,750
two more days
should be more than enough.

528
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:44,666
- Well, if you
keep on going at this rate,

529
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:45,833
you're gonna find
Ram's frozen body and mine

530
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:47,958
rolling around the mansion.

531
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:49,041
And what about you, Mili?

532
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:51,500
Aren't you freezing
in those clothes?

533
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,833
Because I wanna see the ones
you have for the wintertime.

534
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:54,875
- Actually, you know
how I have a contract

535
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:56,166
with Puck and all,
don't you?

536
00:20:56,250 --> 00:21:00,791
Due to that, his magic
influences me differently,

537
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:03,000
so I can adjust it.

538
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:04,166
And that means...

539
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:08,416
even with all
this extreme weather, I...

540
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,833
am completely fine.

541
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:12,208
Don't you feel a little bad

542
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:14,500
about putting your daughter
in such a tough spot?

543
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:17,000
I think we should try
and come up with a plan.

544
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:17,875
[gasps]

545
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:19,666
That's it! There's no need

546
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:22,041
for the rest of us
to stay inside the mansion!

547
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:23,833
Beako's keeping the cold
contained with her barrier,

548
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:26,333
so we can just stay outside

549
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:27,916
until this whole thing
blows over.

550
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,833
- Impressive as always, Subaru!
You have all my respect!

551
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:33,000
- Plus, this time of year,
the weather's mild, so we--

552
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:37,208
BEATRICE:
Doesn't seem like it'll be

553
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:39,458
letting up soon, I suppose.

554
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:40,625
SUBARU: Come on!

555
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:42,708
EMILIA: I don't think
we can camp out in this.

556
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:44,416
- No! If you all have a tent--

557
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,708
- Now, Subaru,
am I somehow mistaken,

558
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:48,583
or are you suggesting that I,

559
00:21:48,666 --> 00:21:52,041
the master of this mansion,
sleep outside?

560
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:53,541
- W-w-well, uh...

561
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:56,041
isn't there something you
can do with your magic, then?

562
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:58,666
Like maybe mustering up
a fireball or something

563
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:02,041
and then blasting it at Puck to
regulate his temperature, huh?

564
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:04,708
- That degree of control
would be difficult.

565
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:06,625
One incorrect movement
of my hand,

566
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:09,250
and the mansion
would be engulfed in fire.

567
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:11,666
- Man! Why does it feel
like our only choices

568
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,875
are a flood from above
or a fire from below?

569
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:15,416
Wait! That's it!

570
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,000
A flood above us
and a fire below!

571
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:18,583
- What are you saying?

572
00:22:18,666 --> 00:22:20,916
- It's a riddle that I remember
hearing from back home!

573
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,083
And the answer is a bath!

574
00:22:24,166 --> 00:22:25,916
In other words, the best way
to beat the cold is...

575
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,583
- What is it? Tell me!

576
00:22:28,666 --> 00:22:30,791
- To use the magic stones
of fire we have

577
00:22:30,875 --> 00:22:32,958
to boil the water
in the big bath!

578
00:22:33,041 --> 00:22:34,083
Then...

579
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:37,500
for the next two days, we'll...

580
00:22:37,583 --> 00:22:37,916
stay in a hot spring!

581
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,791
What do you say?!

582
00:22:39,875 --> 00:22:40,916
- Impressive as always, Subaru!

583
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,500
You have all my respect!

584
00:22:42,583 --> 00:22:44,625
- Unfortunately,
we can't do that.

585
00:22:45,666 --> 00:22:47,041
- What? Why?!

586
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,250
- Is all of this mayonnaise?

587
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:57,500
- Yes. I've been
making this for you,

588
00:22:57,583 --> 00:22:58,791
since I know
how very fond of it you are.

589
00:22:58,875 --> 00:23:01,166
Remember last time?

590
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:03,208
[camera shutter clicking]

591
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:06,500
- [groaning]

592
00:23:06,583 --> 00:23:08,958
- I didn't make
as much as you wanted,

593
00:23:09,041 --> 00:23:11,250
and you ended up
getting pretty angry with me.

594
00:23:12,541 --> 00:23:14,708
So this time,
I used the big bath!

595
00:23:17,875 --> 00:23:21,125
[giggles] If you wish
to praise me now, I won't mind.

596
00:23:22,625 --> 00:23:24,708
- How could you be that stupid?!

597
00:23:24,791 --> 00:23:26,541
- [gasps] Oh, no! You're right!

598
00:23:26,625 --> 00:23:27,625
The mayonnaise has frozen!

599
00:23:27,708 --> 00:23:28,750
- No! Not that!

600
00:23:28,833 --> 00:23:29,750
- But worry not, Subaru!

601
00:23:29,833 --> 00:23:33,458
We can boil it into
a nice, warm mayonnaise bath!

602
00:23:33,541 --> 00:23:35,416
- If you do that,
you're gonna earn the wrath

603
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,875
of every mayo lover
in the world!

604
00:23:41,291 --> 00:23:44,541
It still feels cold
right here next to the fire.

605
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:46,166
PUCK: But if
it weren't for this,

606
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:48,500
everyone in the mansion
would be frozen solid.

607
00:23:48,583 --> 00:23:49,916
Wanna test it out?

608
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,666
- Yeah, how 'bout
we<i> don't</i> do that?

609
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:54,166
Instead of releasing magic
slowly over the next two days,

610
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:55,625
can't you just unleash it

611
00:23:55,708 --> 00:23:57,708
in one massive blast
and be done with it?

612
00:23:57,791 --> 00:24:00,041
- In that case, does it mean
you plan on giving me...

613
00:24:00,125 --> 00:24:03,916
the permission
to destroy everything

614
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
and everyone
living in this world?

615
00:24:05,083 --> 00:24:06,291
SUBARU: That would be a no!

616
00:24:06,375 --> 00:24:08,666
- I was just kidding.
- So, anyway,

617
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:11,041
does this magic release thing
only happen to spirits,

618
00:24:11,125 --> 00:24:13,166
or do you and Beako
go through it, too?

619
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:16,708
- In my case, I use my magic
on a daily basis,

620
00:24:16,791 --> 00:24:18,958
which keeps it
well regulated.

621
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:20,791
My duties require that,
after all.

622
00:24:20,875 --> 00:24:21,833
[Ram moans]

623
00:24:21,916 --> 00:24:22,833
- Uh...

624
00:24:23,666 --> 00:24:27,500
- So my od always
has plenty of leeway.

625
00:24:27,583 --> 00:24:29,625
- Why did you look at Ram
when you said that?

626
00:24:29,708 --> 00:24:31,500
- [sighs]
- SUBARU: Uh, you know what?

627
00:24:31,583 --> 00:24:33,125
Never mind. I don't wanna know.

628
00:24:33,208 --> 00:24:35,500
- I maintain
the forbidden library

629
00:24:35,583 --> 00:24:37,791
and use my Door Crossing,
I suppose.

630
00:24:37,875 --> 00:24:39,208
Oh, right.
And recently, smacking away

631
00:24:39,291 --> 00:24:43,125
a certain noisy human
has been helping also.

632
00:24:43,208 --> 00:24:45,875
- Yeah, yeah. Very cute.
- [growls]

633
00:24:45,958 --> 00:24:47,708
- So what about
the two of you, then?

634
00:24:47,791 --> 00:24:48,875
Don't you have a mating--

635
00:24:48,958 --> 00:24:52,208
uh, I mean, have
a magic release period, too?

636
00:24:52,291 --> 00:24:55,416
- Only certain people with
really powerful magic have them.

637
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,708
For most, it's something
that isn't necessary.

638
00:24:57,791 --> 00:25:00,541
- I'm not a particularly strong
magic user, either,

639
00:25:00,625 --> 00:25:03,250
so I've also
never had to have one.

640
00:25:03,333 --> 00:25:07,666
Oh, but still, I have experience
from dealing with Puck's,

641
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:09,750
so I'm sorry
about what happened this time.

642
00:25:09,833 --> 00:25:12,125
I feel awful.

643
00:25:12,208 --> 00:25:13,833
- [thinking]<i> Man, Mili's really</i>
<i>beating herself up today.</i>

644
00:25:13,916 --> 00:25:15,375
Well, how about you?

645
00:25:15,458 --> 00:25:18,166
When was the last time
that you got to use

646
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:19,833
a good amount of magic, Puck?

647
00:25:19,916 --> 00:25:20,916
Just for a reference.

648
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,083
- Hmm. The last time, huh?

649
00:25:22,166 --> 00:25:24,208
It was probably when I fought

650
00:25:24,291 --> 00:25:25,125
that lady in black
in the capital.

651
00:25:25,208 --> 00:25:27,833
I actually ran out of mana then.

652
00:25:27,916 --> 00:25:29,916
SUBARU: I really hope
you're not askin' me

653
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,041
to bring you
another opponent that insane!

654
00:25:32,125 --> 00:25:33,458
I don't wanna be
forced to choose

655
00:25:33,541 --> 00:25:36,041
between being disemboweled
and freezing to death!

656
00:25:36,125 --> 00:25:37,250
- And I think before that
was when Roswaal

657
00:25:37,333 --> 00:25:39,375
came to the forest
to pick up Lia.

658
00:25:39,458 --> 00:25:41,750
It's kind of
embarrassing to say,

659
00:25:41,833 --> 00:25:44,083
but I think I caused
quite a fuss back then.

660
00:25:44,166 --> 00:25:48,166
- Ah, yes. It was
an exhilarating experience.

661
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:50,916
That was
the very first time in my life

662
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,958
I had participated
in such a large-scale magic war.

663
00:25:54,041 --> 00:25:56,208
At least, I think so!

664
00:25:56,291 --> 00:25:58,083
- You just came
right at me without warning.

665
00:25:58,166 --> 00:25:59,458
I couldn't believe it. [laughs]

666
00:25:59,541 --> 00:26:03,125
ROSWAAL: Indeed. We spent
the full day and night

667
00:26:03,208 --> 00:26:05,708
clashing in earnest.

668
00:26:05,791 --> 00:26:08,583
SUBARU: So what exactly
happened there, Mili?

669
00:26:08,666 --> 00:26:10,041
EMILIA: Afterwards,
I heard they had to redraw

670
00:26:10,125 --> 00:26:12,291
the maps for that area.

671
00:26:12,375 --> 00:26:13,958
SUBARU: Nope! Don't like that!

672
00:26:14,041 --> 00:26:15,666
Operation Pitting Friends
Against Each Other

673
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,750
- is hereby rejected!
- PUCK: Aww.

674
00:26:17,833 --> 00:26:18,666
- Don't give me that!

675
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:20,625
No changing the geography
by fighting!

676
00:26:20,708 --> 00:26:22,166
Apologize to Ino Tadataka!

677
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:25,833
PUCK: I am so sorry,
Mr. Tadataka!

678
00:26:27,333 --> 00:26:28,333
Was that okay?

679
00:26:31,791 --> 00:26:32,875
- [sighs] Right now,

680
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:35,916
our first priority should be
keeping the fire going.

681
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,125
- I really am sorry about this.

682
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:39,958
When Puck and I
lived in the forest,

683
00:26:40,041 --> 00:26:41,666
there was no one around
to worry about,

684
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:45,625
so I never realized it could be
this big of a problem.

685
00:26:45,708 --> 00:26:48,958
- Stop. You don't need
to keep on apologizing, okay?

686
00:26:49,041 --> 00:26:50,166
'Cause I can
figure somethin' out.

687
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:53,000
Every night breaks into dawn.

688
00:26:53,083 --> 00:26:55,791
There's no rain
that doesn't cease!

689
00:26:55,875 --> 00:26:56,250
[rain pattering]

690
00:26:56,333 --> 00:26:58,833
Oh, yeah. The rain.

691
00:26:58,916 --> 00:27:02,166
A little later on tonight,
it's gonna turn to snow.

692
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:03,708
But even in the daylight,

693
00:27:03,791 --> 00:27:06,541
the weather's so cold,
that'll happen.

694
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:09,250
- Subaru? Did you just come up
with another strange idea?

695
00:27:09,333 --> 00:27:11,083
- Impressive as always, Subaru!

696
00:27:11,166 --> 00:27:12,541
You have all my respect!

697
00:27:12,625 --> 00:27:16,041
- Listen, you guys
are jumpin' the gun here,

698
00:27:16,125 --> 00:27:16,666
and that's too much respect.

699
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:19,916
But, yes, I do have an idea,

700
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,041
a way to get through
all this peacefully,

701
00:27:22,125 --> 00:27:24,375
and we can even turn
this magic release period

702
00:27:24,458 --> 00:27:27,041
into something
we can actually enjoy!

703
00:27:27,125 --> 00:27:29,291
- So what is it
you're planning, exactly?

704
00:27:29,375 --> 00:27:31,916
- Back in my homeland,
Hokkaido...

705
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,708
though I do use "homeland"
in a very broad sense here...

706
00:27:35,791 --> 00:27:37,791
we had an amazing festival!

707
00:27:37,875 --> 00:27:38,541
Since Puck's got mana to burn,

708
00:27:38,625 --> 00:27:41,041
we might as well
put it to good use!

709
00:27:41,125 --> 00:27:43,125
We'll call it...

710
00:27:43,208 --> 00:27:47,166
the Roswaal Mansion's
first Wild and Crazy...

711
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:51,083
Snow Festival! [chuckles]

712
00:27:51,166 --> 00:27:52,833
- Impressive as always, Subaru!
- [gasps]

713
00:27:52,916 --> 00:27:53,625
A Wild and Crazy
Snow Festival, huh?

714
00:27:53,708 --> 00:27:54,541
SUBARU: I know.
Awesome, isn't it?

715
00:27:54,625 --> 00:27:56,500
- [Rem swoons]
- Since you seem so into it...

716
00:27:56,583 --> 00:28:00,083
EMILIA: Is the "wild and crazy"
part necessary?

717
00:28:00,166 --> 00:28:01,750
SUBARU: All right!
Let's get to work!

718
00:28:01,833 --> 00:28:02,833
[music playing]

719
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:14,083
SUBARU: The driving snow
has enveloped the mansion

720
00:28:14,166 --> 00:28:16,416
and our hearts as well!

721
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,750
A blanket of pure white
as far as the eye can see!

722
00:28:19,833 --> 00:28:21,958
But just as every night
breaks into dawn,

723
00:28:22,041 --> 00:28:23,875
every snow
will eventually cease!

724
00:28:23,958 --> 00:28:24,750
Bid farewell to the frozen sky,

725
00:28:24,833 --> 00:28:28,250
and welcome
our out-of-season Snow Festival!

726
00:28:28,333 --> 00:28:31,291
Now let's go to New York!

727
00:28:31,375 --> 00:28:32,250
Ready?!

728
00:28:32,333 --> 00:28:33,416
- New York?
- [murmuring]

729
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,291
- Huh?
- CHILDREN: Yeah!

730
00:28:35,375 --> 00:28:37,125
- We'll all go to New York,
no matter what it takes!

731
00:28:37,208 --> 00:28:39,125
Are you excited?!

732
00:28:39,208 --> 00:28:40,875
VILLAGERS: Yeah!

733
00:28:40,958 --> 00:28:42,791
- But where is this place?

734
00:28:42,875 --> 00:28:45,125
- It's a big town
back where Subaru's from.

735
00:28:45,208 --> 00:28:47,125
- He said it's "swirling
with love and desire"!

736
00:28:47,208 --> 00:28:48,333
- Yeah! Swirling!

737
00:28:48,416 --> 00:28:49,958
- The rules are simple.

738
00:28:50,041 --> 00:28:51,500
Each of you will try to build

739
00:28:51,583 --> 00:28:53,958
the most unique
and imaginative snow sculpture.

740
00:28:54,041 --> 00:28:55,166
And of course
we have a fantastic prize

741
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:57,791
for the winner, too!

742
00:28:57,875 --> 00:28:59,708
MILDO: Will we get
to go to New York?

743
00:28:59,791 --> 00:29:01,833
- I'm sorry,
but that'd be impossible.

744
00:29:01,916 --> 00:29:03,583
Don't you worry, though,
'cause I promise it's a prize

745
00:29:03,666 --> 00:29:06,875
that's just as amazing
as a trip out there!

746
00:29:06,958 --> 00:29:09,125
Okay, everyone,
do your best, all right?!

747
00:29:09,208 --> 00:29:11,208
VILLAGERS: Yeah!

748
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:14,416
[villagers murmuring]

749
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,166
- I never would have
even thought

750
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:18,416
about putting on
a snow festival here.

751
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,500
- I just figured
that if we couldn't hide it,

752
00:29:20,583 --> 00:29:22,875
then we should all
find a way to celebrate it.

753
00:29:22,958 --> 00:29:24,708
- [chuckles] I'll work hard

754
00:29:24,791 --> 00:29:27,541
to beat the band and
make a fantastic sculpture!

755
00:29:27,625 --> 00:29:31,166
- Nobody says, "Beat the band"
in this day in age.

756
00:29:32,583 --> 00:29:35,500
[villagers murmuring]

757
00:29:35,583 --> 00:29:37,000
- Eh?

758
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:41,166
Aha! I found you!

759
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:43,458
Man, this worked out
really great,

760
00:29:43,541 --> 00:29:45,458
and we never
could have done it if you

761
00:29:45,541 --> 00:29:46,625
hadn't adjusted the range
of your barrier for us.

762
00:29:46,708 --> 00:29:50,166
- Honestly, this is
all such a big fuss.

763
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:52,208
I should have expanded it
a little further

764
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:53,291
so they could have
their festival

765
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:54,916
in the village, I suppose.

766
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,500
- That would have been
pretty disastrous

767
00:29:56,583 --> 00:29:57,875
for the village, though...

768
00:29:57,958 --> 00:29:59,375
and even more so
for my first date with Mili.

769
00:29:59,458 --> 00:30:00,541
It would completely ruin

770
00:30:00,625 --> 00:30:02,875
the secret flower garden,
you know?

771
00:30:02,958 --> 00:30:05,083
- I do know. But I also
don't care about that at all.

772
00:30:05,166 --> 00:30:09,541
- Anyway, Beako, don't you want
to come join in on the fun?

773
00:30:09,625 --> 00:30:11,375
There's no need to be shy.

774
00:30:11,458 --> 00:30:14,000
- And just who is being shy,
I suppose?

775
00:30:14,083 --> 00:30:16,875
I'm very busy right now.
Shoo! Shoo!

776
00:30:16,958 --> 00:30:18,583
- [sighs] Come on.
Don't be like that.

777
00:30:18,666 --> 00:30:21,958
Everyone should play outside
now and then,

778
00:30:22,041 --> 00:30:24,125
'specially when it
comes to children.

779
00:30:24,208 --> 00:30:26,333
- [shrieks]

780
00:30:26,416 --> 00:30:27,541
- Buenos Aires!

781
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:28,791
[snow crunches]

782
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,875
- Hey! Look, it's Subaru!

783
00:30:32,958 --> 00:30:34,208
- Yeah! Where did he come from?!

784
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:36,208
- Have a taste
of my fearsome strike!

785
00:30:36,291 --> 00:30:37,458
- [children laughing]
- Even in this cold,

786
00:30:37,541 --> 00:30:39,416
you guys have so much energy.

787
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,333
However...

788
00:30:41,416 --> 00:30:42,583
you'll soon come to realize...

789
00:30:42,666 --> 00:30:46,000
that the ones
in danger from snow

790
00:30:46,083 --> 00:30:48,333
were all of you
right from the beginning.

791
00:30:48,416 --> 00:30:49,333
PUCK: There!

792
00:30:49,416 --> 00:30:52,416
- [laughing]

793
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,916
- Want another one?
What do you say?

794
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,250
- Absolutely not!

795
00:30:57,333 --> 00:30:59,250
- Hey, Subaru,
look at what I made.

796
00:30:59,333 --> 00:31:01,166
And I did it
all by myself, too!

797
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:03,375
- Oh, wow. It's a snow bunny!

798
00:31:03,458 --> 00:31:05,916
- [laughs]
It's really cute, isn't it?

799
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
So do you think
I did a good job?

800
00:31:08,083 --> 00:31:09,333
- Yeah, you sure did!

801
00:31:09,416 --> 00:31:11,083
- But how about this?
- Huh?

802
00:31:11,166 --> 00:31:13,250
Let's make it even fancier!

803
00:31:13,333 --> 00:31:14,583
Check this out.

804
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:18,791
- Wow! Look what you did!

805
00:31:18,875 --> 00:31:22,125
It's just like
a real-life bunny rabbit!

806
00:31:22,208 --> 00:31:25,875
- Just seeing you so happy makes
me feel pretty pumped up, too.

807
00:31:25,958 --> 00:31:28,000
All right, then!
How 'bout we really

808
00:31:28,083 --> 00:31:30,166
take this thing
to the next level, huh?

809
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:31,541
We'll give it
a tail and wings...

810
00:31:31,625 --> 00:31:34,208
- PETRA: Huh?
- and missiles

811
00:31:34,291 --> 00:31:35,208
a transformation ability,

812
00:31:35,291 --> 00:31:36,958
a cockpit,
and caterpillar tracks.

813
00:31:37,041 --> 00:31:38,958
PETRA: Wait a minute!
J-Just hold on!

814
00:31:41,375 --> 00:31:43,458
- How's that?!

815
00:31:43,541 --> 00:31:47,166
The flying assault form
of the ultra-firepower weapon...

816
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:50,333
BUN-E of snow!

819
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,041
- Well, I guess Petra's

820
00:31:56,125 --> 00:31:57,833
more into real robots
than super ones.

821
00:31:57,916 --> 00:32:02,000
- [children laughing]
- Hey, check it out.

822
00:32:02,083 --> 00:32:05,375
- Honestly, he simply
can't help himself, I suppose.

823
00:32:06,375 --> 00:32:07,625
- I think that Subaru

824
00:32:07,708 --> 00:32:10,041
just wants you to go
and play with him, Betty.

825
00:32:10,125 --> 00:32:12,291
Actually, I was kinda
hoping you'd do that, too.

826
00:32:12,375 --> 00:32:15,166
- Bubby.

827
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:16,166
[Subaru and children chatter]

828
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:17,208

- Over here!

- [gasps]

833
00:32:26,458 --> 00:32:28,416
Oh, Beatrice.

834
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:31,333
- Bubby insisted I do this,
I suppose,

835
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:33,458
so I'll be joining you
for a little bit.

836
00:32:33,541 --> 00:32:35,708
You should be grateful,
I suppose.

837
00:32:35,791 --> 00:32:37,083
- [chuckles]

838
00:32:38,291 --> 00:32:40,666
Just know I don't plan to lose.

839
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,541
[snow crunching]

840
00:32:42,625 --> 00:32:45,500
[villagers chatting]

841
00:32:48,625 --> 00:32:51,333
- Their sculptures really
seem to be coming together.

842
00:32:51,416 --> 00:32:52,375
- They are.
Although I gotta admit,

843
00:32:52,458 --> 00:32:53,833
it is a bit of a letdown

844
00:32:53,916 --> 00:32:56,250
that they're all
leaning toward realism.

845
00:32:56,333 --> 00:32:57,750
There's no pop culture here,

846
00:32:57,833 --> 00:33:00,416
so I guess it makes sense
it's mostly castles and animals.

847
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:03,291
Ah. Oh, hey there.

848
00:33:03,375 --> 00:33:04,291
This one looks really...

849
00:33:04,375 --> 00:33:06,666
nice?

850
00:33:08,708 --> 00:33:10,708
- Thank you.
I appreciate that, Subaru.

851
00:33:10,791 --> 00:33:12,583
This ulgarm is my best work.

852
00:33:12,666 --> 00:33:13,583
- Is this saying
that once it swallows you,

853
00:33:13,666 --> 00:33:16,083
you'll forget what warmth is?!

854
00:33:16,166 --> 00:33:17,375
' Cause that isn't funny!

855
00:33:17,458 --> 00:33:19,291
I like art that makes an impact,

856
00:33:19,375 --> 00:33:21,250
and I can tell you put in
lots of effort,

857
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:24,000
but because it shows
a strong lack of consideration

858
00:33:24,083 --> 00:33:26,416
for your judge,
I can only give it seven points!

859
00:33:28,541 --> 00:33:30,291
- All right. I think
it's looking pretty good.

860
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:32,333
[gasps]

861
00:33:33,666 --> 00:33:35,375
Wait! That's cheating!

862
00:33:35,458 --> 00:33:38,000
Hey! You know
you shouldn't do that.

863
00:33:38,083 --> 00:33:39,458
- I don't remember seeing
a rule written anywhere

864
00:33:39,541 --> 00:33:41,500
stating that I can't.

865
00:33:41,583 --> 00:33:42,666
- It's not right.

866
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:44,708
No magic allowed, okay?

867
00:33:44,791 --> 00:33:46,083
You should never cheat.

868
00:33:46,166 --> 00:33:49,125
You have to use your own hands
to grasp victory.

869

- [groans]

870
00:33:50,291 --> 00:33:52,333
Hmph.

871
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,291
- [giggles]

872
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:01,291
- [all gasping]
- Look at this one.

873
00:34:01,375 --> 00:34:04,083
- What a beautiful sight.
This is the best.

874
00:34:04,166 --> 00:34:05,833
- By the way, I'm curious
about the sculpture scoring.

875
00:34:05,916 --> 00:34:08,708
Who's in charge
of deciding all that?

876
00:34:08,791 --> 00:34:11,125
- There's me and Roswaal...

877
00:34:11,208 --> 00:34:14,125
and then there's Muraosa,
who's our secret judge.

878
00:34:14,208 --> 00:34:16,291
I figured if they knew
who the judges were,

879
00:34:16,375 --> 00:34:18,125
some people
might resort to bribery

880
00:34:18,208 --> 00:34:20,791
or making under-the-table deals
to make sure they win.

881
00:34:20,875 --> 00:34:22,708
- Do you think
someone would go that far

882
00:34:22,791 --> 00:34:24,750
to nab the prize
you're offering?

883
00:34:24,833 --> 00:34:28,125
- Totally. It's a top-tier,
gorgeous, one-of-a-kind item,

884
00:34:28,208 --> 00:34:29,500
and I'll be
presenting it myself.

885
00:34:29,583 --> 00:34:31,791
- Oh, wow. This wasn't even
your problem in the first place.

886
00:34:31,875 --> 00:34:33,500
You're really generous,
aren't you?

887
00:34:33,583 --> 00:34:35,666
- Other than you,

888
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:38,125
it's Mili who's dealing
with the most, right?

889
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:38,958
So of course I'm helping out.

890
00:34:39,041 --> 00:34:42,541
- Ah. As far
as I'm concerned, Subaru,

891
00:34:42,625 --> 00:34:43,958
I think that part of you
is really, you know.

892
00:34:44,041 --> 00:34:47,458
- No, I don't know.
You said a bunch of words,

893
00:34:47,541 --> 00:34:48,500
but none of them
meant much of anything.

894
00:34:48,583 --> 00:34:50,458
- Is that so?

895
00:34:50,541 --> 00:34:52,375
- Subaru, please come
take a look at this.

896
00:34:52,458 --> 00:34:55,625
My sister and I have constructed
this sculpture together.

897
00:34:55,708 --> 00:34:56,958
- I didn't know
you two were participating.

898
00:34:57,041 --> 00:34:59,666
I thought you were
just helping out.

899
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:02,083
- No, Barusu.
Our supreme artistic sense

900
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:03,541
must have brought you
toward us both instinctually.

901
00:35:03,625 --> 00:35:05,916
- I'm not sure how I feel

902
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,500
about you treating me
like a moth drawn to a flame,

903
00:35:07,583 --> 00:35:09,750
but show me.

904
00:35:09,833 --> 00:35:11,291
What convinced you to take part

905
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:13,791
in a freezing-cold
snow festival, anyway, Ram?

906
00:35:13,875 --> 00:35:15,833
- You expected me
to just rot in bed

907
00:35:15,916 --> 00:35:16,750
while Rem and the others
were outside

908
00:35:16,833 --> 00:35:18,916
having an enjoyable time
in the snow?

909
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,625
- That was
an awfully bitter response.

910
00:35:21,708 --> 00:35:22,458
But I suppose that means

911
00:35:22,541 --> 00:35:24,666
you didn't want
to be left out, right?

912
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:26,625
- I so earnestly wished
to have a little fun with Ram

913
00:35:26,708 --> 00:35:29,500
that I asked her to join me.

914
00:35:29,583 --> 00:35:31,375
- Don't you feel
at least sort of guilty

915
00:35:31,458 --> 00:35:33,958
for making your little sister
beg like that?

916
00:35:34,041 --> 00:35:36,833
- I admit her love gives me
quite the superiority complex,

917
00:35:36,916 --> 00:35:38,375
so go ahead and envy me.

918
00:35:38,458 --> 00:35:40,541
- [sighs]

919
00:35:40,625 --> 00:35:41,916
What is it?

920
00:35:43,333 --> 00:35:44,708
- Now presenting...

921
00:35:44,791 --> 00:35:46,666
our finest work
displaying our strength,

922
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:48,333
artistic talent,
and sisterly love.

923
00:35:48,416 --> 00:35:50,875
- That's right. And with my
sister's spectacular direction,

924
00:35:50,958 --> 00:35:53,875
I produced
the best work I could.

925
00:35:53,958 --> 00:35:55,541
SUBARU: Pretty sure
you just casually admitted

926
00:35:55,625 --> 00:35:56,375
she didn't do anything!

927
00:35:56,458 --> 00:35:59,291
So what are you
calling your sculpture?

928
00:35:59,375 --> 00:36:03,500
REM: We've titled it "A Statue
of the Magnificent Subawaal."

929
00:36:03,583 --> 00:36:05,708
SUBARU: Well, I can tell
where this is going.

930
00:36:05,791 --> 00:36:07,416
REM: Take a look!

931
00:36:12,958 --> 00:36:14,916
[music playing]

932
00:36:17,125 --> 00:36:19,833
My sister wanted the sculpture
to be of Master Roswaal,

933
00:36:19,916 --> 00:36:22,166
but I wanted it
to be of you, Subaru.

934
00:36:23,333 --> 00:36:25,375
RAM: After searching
for a compromise,

935
00:36:25,458 --> 00:36:26,916
this is the solution we reached.

936
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,291
SUBARU: The only thing you've
compromised is my happiness!

937
00:36:29,375 --> 00:36:31,583
- My, how very interesting.

938
00:36:31,666 --> 00:36:33,375
For what reason
have the three of you

939
00:36:33,458 --> 00:36:34,916
gathered out here together?

940
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,083
And what might this be?

941
00:36:36,166 --> 00:36:40,416
- Uh, Master Roswaal,
I'm quite embarrassed,

942
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,750
but please do take

- Yeah, individually,

1102
00:43:36,041 --> 00:43:37,833
- Just so you know,
I'm not anywhere near

1103
00:43:37,916 --> 00:43:40,041
too young to do that,
according to your laws.

1104
00:43:40,125 --> 00:43:43,125
I'll be turning 18 this year,
so I'm totally an adult.

1105
00:43:43,208 --> 00:43:46,541
- I don't think an adult would
be acting quite so boisterous,

1106
00:43:46,625 --> 00:43:49,208
but I didn't know
that you were 18. I, uh...

1107
00:43:49,291 --> 00:43:52,625
assumed you were a lot younger.

1108
00:43:52,708 --> 00:43:55,500
- Oh, yeah?
How old did you think I was?

1109
00:43:55,583 --> 00:43:57,083
- Uh...

1110
00:43:57,166 --> 00:43:58,166
- 12?
- Eh?

1111
00:43:58,250 --> 00:43:59,125
- I mean 13! 13!

1112
00:43:59,208 --> 00:44:01,291
- Come on! That would
make me younger than Felt!

1113
00:44:01,375 --> 00:44:03,083
Man, that's really hard to hear.

1114
00:44:03,166 --> 00:44:06,208
More importantly,
what about you, Mili?

1115
00:44:06,291 --> 00:44:08,291
I can assure you
that I'm not 13.

1116
00:44:08,375 --> 00:44:10,083
And I've never
had liquor before,

1117
00:44:10,166 --> 00:44:10,958
but I'm old enough to drink.

1118
00:44:11,041 --> 00:44:13,875
- I never doubted it.
And if you were 13,

1119
00:44:13,958 --> 00:44:16,041
I'm pretty sure
I'd be considered a criminal.

1120
00:44:16,125 --> 00:44:18,208
- What would make you say
something like that?

1121
00:44:18,291 --> 00:44:19,375
- Well, it's because...

1122
00:44:19,458 --> 00:44:22,666
you're just so darn adorable

1123
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:23,333
that it makes me
want to commit crimes.

1124
00:44:23,416 --> 00:44:25,875
- Anyway, about the alcohol,

1125
00:44:25,958 --> 00:44:27,291
Puck says
I'm not allowed to have any.

1126
00:44:27,375 --> 00:44:28,041
- You just
straight up ignored me!

1127
00:44:28,125 --> 00:44:30,750
- Of course I said that.

1128
00:44:30,833 --> 00:44:33,750
It's because drinking
is what bad grown-ups do!

1129
00:44:33,833 --> 00:44:35,916
And if I see any
put in front of Lia,

1130
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,916
I'll guzzle each one
and take 'em down!

1131
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,416
[fighting yells]

1132
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:42,916
- That said, I see no problem
if it's just for tonight.

1133
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,083
- Hmm?
- See?

1134
00:44:45,166 --> 00:44:47,833
It would be such a shame
if all of this well-aged alcohol

1135
00:44:47,916 --> 00:44:50,291
that I found in the wine cellar
were to go to waste.

1136
00:44:50,375 --> 00:44:51,333

[slurring] What's wrong, Subaru?

- really funny face right now.

00:45:09,083 --> 00:45:09,583
And whoa!

1142
00:45:09,666 --> 00:45:11,875
There are so many of you!

1143
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,666
- It's no fair!
- Eh?

1144
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:16,250
- I mean, all you Subarus
are tryin' to hog

1145
00:45:16,333 --> 00:45:18,833
- all the sweets!
- Whoa!

- [moans]
- [groans]

1147

Hey, now be careful, Mili.

1148
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:24,416
I think you've had enough.

1149
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:27,083
Look. You're getting
crumbs everywhere.

But that drink was so yummy!

1152
00:45:31,458 --> 00:45:35,208
Not fair! You kept
this secret for so long!

1153

[bells jingle]

1154
00:45:36,208 --> 00:45:39,208
You've all been going
behind my back with it

1155
00:45:39,291 --> 00:45:40,125
and sneakin' around,

1156
00:45:40,208 --> 00:45:43,375

Agh! She's just too damn cute!

1161
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:53,833
- Subaru.

1162
00:45:53,916 --> 00:45:55,541
- Yes? What is it you need, Rem?

1163
00:45:55,625 --> 00:45:57,916
- [grunts]

1164
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,375
- Uh, excuse me, but that hurts.

1165
00:46:00,458 --> 00:46:02,291
Guess somebody's
had one too many.

1166
00:46:02,375 --> 00:46:03,333
- Hmm.
- [gasps]

1167
00:46:03,416 --> 00:46:05,083
- Now, don't make fun of me,

1168
00:46:05,166 --> 00:46:06,833
Subaru! Subaru! Subaru!

1169
00:46:06,916 --> 00:46:08,375
- You just said my name
three times,

1170
00:46:08,458 --> 00:46:09,875
so, uh, what's goin' on?

1171
00:46:09,958 --> 00:46:12,000
- I'm usually very serious,

1172
00:46:12,083 --> 00:46:14,458
because my job
is so important to me, but...

1173
00:46:14,541 --> 00:46:16,791
since today
is all about having fun,

1174
00:46:16,875 --> 00:46:19,541
I guess I ended up letting
my guard down a little bit.

1175
00:46:19,625 --> 00:46:22,166
Either way, this whole thing
is your fault, Subaru.

1176
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:25,166
- [gasps]
- Mmm.

- You're a cat now?

1179
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,166
Given everything
I know about 'em,

1180
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:33,166
I thought demons
would hold their alcohol better.

1181
00:46:33,250 --> 00:46:36,000
RAM: Well, that actually is
true for demons, as a race.

1182
00:46:36,083 --> 00:46:40,166
In fact, I often drank alongside
the adults when I was smaller.

1183
00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:41,541
- Think you just admitted
to underage drinking

1184
00:46:41,625 --> 00:46:44,375
like it's a totally normal
thing to do,

1185
00:46:44,458 --> 00:46:45,583
but I guess you don't seem
to be turning red

1186
00:46:45,666 --> 00:46:48,375
or slurring
your words too much.

1187
00:46:48,458 --> 00:46:49,208
- Now, don't be ridiculous.

I have experi--[burps]

1189
00:46:51,083 --> 00:46:53,416
- Uh...

1190
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:55,875
I guess if there's anything I've
learned at all from tonight,

1191
00:46:55,958 --> 00:46:59,000
it's that maybe certain girls
who normally don't drink

1192
00:46:59,083 --> 00:47:01,208
should try
and keep it that way.

1193
00:47:01,291 --> 00:47:03,583
- Now, that's quite
an extreme proclamation.

1194
00:47:03,666 --> 00:47:05,291
[Puck laughs]

Well, perfect time
to pick on her for a while.

1200
00:47:18,625 --> 00:47:21,250
Hey, Mili, you think you
could keep an eye on Rem for me?

1201
00:47:21,333 --> 00:47:23,458
- Sure. No problem!

1202
00:47:23,541 --> 00:47:28,208
Hey, come here, Rem, okay?

1203
00:47:28,291 --> 00:47:29,083
Mmm!

1204
00:47:29,166 --> 00:47:32,000
[giggles]

1205
00:47:32,083 --> 00:47:34,666
Oh, wow! You're so cute.

[giggles]

1207
00:47:35,333 --> 00:47:37,416
- I want a picture.

1208
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:39,875
- I'm burning it
into my eyelids as we speak.

1209
00:47:42,750 --> 00:47:45,083
- You gonna stand here
by yourself the whole time?

1210
00:47:45,166 --> 00:47:46,083
If you're always alone,

1211
00:47:46,166 --> 00:47:46,958
then you'll never
want to do anything.

1212
00:47:47,041 --> 00:47:50,166
- That was unjustified slander,
I suppose,

1213
00:47:50,250 --> 00:47:51,416
and none of your business,
either.

1214
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:52,916
- Don't say that.

1215
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,333
Here. Now drink up.

- [grumbles]

1217
00:47:55,333 --> 00:47:58,125
- It's safe.
No booze in there whatsoever.

1218
00:47:58,208 --> 00:48:00,500
Just some delicious,
freshly squeezed appa juice.

1219
00:48:00,583 --> 00:48:02,333
- Do not treat me like a child,
I suppose.

1220
00:48:02,416 --> 00:48:04,416
In fact, next to Bubby,

1221
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:05,666
I'm the oldest one
in this mansion.

1222
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:07,083
- Whoa! Check that out!

1223
00:48:07,166 --> 00:48:09,208
Mili and Rem are even
more wrapped around each other

1224
00:48:09,291 --> 00:48:10,541
than they were earlier!

1225
00:48:10,625 --> 00:48:13,208
- You are being unbelievably
rude right now, I suppose!

1226
00:48:13,291 --> 00:48:14,583
- Wait! You've got it all wrong!

1227
00:48:14,666 --> 00:48:16,458
Those two are
getting cozy in a way

1228
00:48:16,541 --> 00:48:17,958
that would make any guy
really happy,

1229
00:48:18,041 --> 00:48:19,375
and it's not like they've
stolen my heart or anything,

1230
00:48:19,458 --> 00:48:22,125
but damn, I want a camera!

1231
00:48:22,208 --> 00:48:25,583
- That wasn't persuasive
in the slightest, I suppose!

1232
00:48:25,666 --> 00:48:28,291
- Anyway, while I don't
actually know how old you are,

1233
00:48:28,375 --> 00:48:29,875
based on the way you look,

1234
00:48:29,958 --> 00:48:30,541
it'd be weird
if I handed you liquor.

1235
00:48:30,625 --> 00:48:35,041
But we can still toast. Cheers.

1236

[music playing]

1238
00:48:41,875 --> 00:48:45,166
- It's crazy how many stars
you can see from out here.

1239
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:47,500
Okay, since you have
nothing better to do,

1240
00:48:47,583 --> 00:48:49,500
I'll tell you
something amazing.

1241
00:48:49,583 --> 00:48:51,666
Every star you can see
shining in the sky

1242
00:48:51,750 --> 00:48:54,125
has its own name
and its own story.

1243
00:48:54,208 --> 00:48:56,500
For example, the giant one
that's sparkling up there,

1244
00:48:56,583 --> 00:48:59,250
that's the North Star.

1245
00:48:59,333 --> 00:49:01,625
If you get lost,
you can follow it home.

1246
00:49:01,708 --> 00:49:03,500
It'll usually
lead you due north.

1247
00:49:03,583 --> 00:49:04,541
- That's south.

1248
00:49:04,625 --> 00:49:06,208
You're backwards, I suppose.

1249
00:49:06,291 --> 00:49:06,875
- Uh, all right, then.

1250
00:49:06,958 --> 00:49:09,458
See that M? That group of stars

1251
00:49:09,541 --> 00:49:11,666
is a constellation
called Cassiopeia.

1252
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:14,500
- Well, I have
no idea what an M is,

1253
00:49:14,583 --> 00:49:16,666
so it still doesn't look
like any shape to me.

1254
00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:18,541
- What are you
doing now, Barusu?

1255
00:49:18,625 --> 00:49:20,458
- Are you telling secrets?

1256

1258
00:49:24,041 --> 00:49:26,333
- Oh, hey, everybody.
I was just telling Beatrice

1259
00:49:26,416 --> 00:49:28,375
about some
of the stars up there.

1260

- The shiny stars!

1261
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:31,791
- Subaru, Subaru.
- SUBARU: Now...

1262
00:49:33,208 --> 00:49:36,125
the challenge that you've
all been waiting for.

1263
00:49:36,208 --> 00:49:38,375
You'll work together and...

- [sputters]
- Wait!

1268

Don't glare at me like that!

1269
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,500
I think there's
a misunderstanding here!

1270
00:49:49,583 --> 00:49:52,625
I mean, yeah, Subaru is my name,

1271
00:49:52,708 --> 00:49:55,208
but my folks got it
from the constellation, okay?!

1272
00:49:55,291 --> 00:49:57,375
- How cruel of your parents
to give you

1273
00:49:57,458 --> 00:49:59,291
the name of a group
of brilliant stars

1274
00:49:59,375 --> 00:50:00,375
that you could never live up to.

1275
00:50:00,458 --> 00:50:04,000
- Forever doomed to be compared
to their great majesty,

1276
00:50:04,083 --> 00:50:06,291
yet you don't shine.
It's rather sad.

1277
00:50:06,375 --> 00:50:09,250
- Why do you two
have to gang up on me like this?

1278
00:50:09,333 --> 00:50:10,708
- Aw, don't worry.
It'll be okay!

1279
00:50:10,791 --> 00:50:12,708
After all,
stars are a symbol of hope,

1280
00:50:12,791 --> 00:50:15,541
which means it's too soon
for you to give up now.

1281
00:50:15,625 --> 00:50:17,375

for the advice.

There are so many snow spirits!

1285
00:50:26,833 --> 00:50:28,375
SUBARU: Wow.

1286
00:50:28,458 --> 00:50:30,458
That's incredible.

What did you think?

1290
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:53,250
The snow festival
was fun, wasn't it?

1291
00:51:05,791 --> 00:51:08,625
- Well, it wasn't bad,
I suppose.

1292
00:51:08,708 --> 00:51:10,666
I'll give you that, at least.

00:51:15,541 --> 00:51:18,125
All right. Then I'll use
the last little bit

1296
00:51:18,208 --> 00:51:20,000
of my extra mana
to share this snow

1297

who are living in the capital!

1301
00:52:16,791 --> 00:52:17,750
So have you finally had enough

1302
00:52:17,833 --> 00:52:20,791
of your little tryst
with Subaru?

1303
00:52:20,875 --> 00:52:22,791
- You shouldn't tease anybody
in that outfit.

1304

I don't find it funny
in the least.

You can't be honest, can you?

This is for you.

1308
00:52:35,375 --> 00:52:37,708
Not having a single drop
on a fanciful night

1309
00:52:37,791 --> 00:52:40,000
such as this
would be such a crime.

1310
00:52:40,958 --> 00:52:42,583
- I'll pass, I suppose.

1311
00:52:42,666 --> 00:52:44,041
- Staying faithful to him,
is that it?

- Now, don't get
the wrong idea about this.

1313

My choice to not drink

1314

has nothing to do with
that boy's request, I suppose.

1315
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:57,250
Long ago, my mother
discouraged me from doing so,

1316
00:52:57,333 --> 00:52:58,375
and that's all.

[no audible dialogue]

00:53:30,375 --> 00:53:31,750
- I was just thinking...

1322
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:32,750
maybe we should have asked
for Subaru's help

1323
00:53:32,833 --> 00:53:34,041
from the very beginning.

1324
00:53:34,125 --> 00:53:36,125
That way, neither one of us
would have felt

1325
00:53:36,208 --> 00:53:39,333
quite so anxious
about what was happening here.

1326
00:53:39,416 --> 00:53:40,666
- Yeah, you got a point.

1327
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:42,291
But then again,
it wouldn't be good

1328
00:53:42,375 --> 00:53:43,916
if you grew up to be
somebody who's always

1329
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,958
relying on other people
for everything, either,

1330
00:53:46,041 --> 00:53:47,791
so even if things seem
way beyond your control,

1331
00:53:47,875 --> 00:53:49,583
give it a try first, okay?

1332
00:53:49,666 --> 00:53:52,041
- Yes, I understand.

1333
00:53:52,125 --> 00:53:52,583

EMILIA: Hey, do you remember

1336
00:53:56,625 --> 00:53:58,875
what Subaru suggested
during his toast?

1337
00:53:58,958 --> 00:54:01,541
- Hmm. That we should hold
another snow festival

1338
00:54:01,625 --> 00:54:04,000
during next year's
magic release period?

1339
00:54:04,083 --> 00:54:06,375
Normally, I wouldn't assume
he'd be interested,

1340
00:54:06,458 --> 00:54:07,458
but I have a feeling

1341
00:54:07,541 --> 00:54:09,791
he could make the next one
even more lively.

1342
00:54:09,875 --> 00:54:10,583
- Me, too.

1343
00:54:10,666 --> 00:54:13,458
I think that side
of him is just so...

1344
00:54:13,541 --> 00:54:15,000
you know.

1345
00:54:15,083 --> 00:54:16,416
- Indeed, it is.

1346
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:18,958
I think it's extremely
"you know" as well.

1347
00:54:19,041 --> 00:54:20,541
- Next year, huh?

1348
00:54:20,625 --> 00:54:23,958
I'm not sure what'll happen
that far into the future.

1349
00:54:24,041 --> 00:54:25,500
I wonder how it'll be.

1350
00:54:25,583 --> 00:54:26,833
- At this point,
it's pretty hard to say,

1351
00:54:26,916 --> 00:54:28,958
but I hope things turn out

1352
00:54:29,041 --> 00:54:30,750
exactly how you
want them to, Lia,

1353
00:54:30,833 --> 00:54:32,583
even if there's no guarantee

1354
00:54:32,666 --> 00:54:34,500
that the snow festival
he was talking about

1355
00:54:34,583 --> 00:54:36,000
will actually take place.

1356
00:54:36,083 --> 00:54:37,958
- You're not
against the idea now, are you?

1357
00:54:38,041 --> 00:54:39,833
- No, it's not that at all.

1358
00:54:39,916 --> 00:54:42,500
I had a whole lot of fun,

1359
00:54:42,583 --> 00:54:45,083
and it looked to me
like you did, too.

1360
00:54:45,166 --> 00:54:47,750
But I'm just wondering
if Subaru will still be happy

1361
00:54:47,833 --> 00:54:50,541
staying by your side
until next year rolls around.

1362
00:54:51,916 --> 00:54:53,708
The wounds on his belly,

1363
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:55,375
the one from the witch
biting him,

1364
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:56,708
all of those scars
he's gotten,

1365
00:54:56,791 --> 00:54:59,958
are the indirect results
of your actions.

1366
00:55:00,041 --> 00:55:02,291
It's not as if
you would ever forget that,

1367
00:55:02,375 --> 00:55:03,500
but it's still
important to remember.

1370
00:55:07,958 --> 00:55:09,041
another snow festival
next year, though,

1371
00:55:09,125 --> 00:55:11,166
because having
the excess mana to do it again

1372
00:55:11,250 --> 00:55:12,875
would mean
I didn't have to use it

1373

on anything big before that.

1374

And I can't think
of anyone but Subaru

1375
00:55:17,583 --> 00:55:18,500
who could lead
an entire festival.
