- Ah. Oh, I see.

162
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:40,083
So discussion on the matter
is already over.

163
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:42,541
I'm relieved.

164
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:44,916
But isn't this circumstance
a bit odd?

165
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,208
It seems too well timed.

166
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:46,875
[door slams open]

167
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:49,708
- Pardon me, sir!

168
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:51,041
The group hiding in the forest

169
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:51,750
has been observed
moving strangely.

170
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:53,875
- [gasps]

171
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:55,041
- We haven't a moment to waste
for the evacuation.

172
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:57,041
Once they make their move,

173
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:58,875
the whole region
will be a sea of blood!

174
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:00,958
What do you want us
to do, Captain?

175
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:03,875
No, Sword Demon Captain Wilhelm.

176
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:05,875
- What is your decision?

177
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:08,125
- [sighs]

178
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:11,541
I understand,

179
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:15,500
and I gratefully
accept your kindness.

180
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:17,041
Has this been explained
to the villagers?

181
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:19,208
RAM: Yes. They've been informed

182
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:21,875
in a timely fashion,
Miss Emilia.

183
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:23,791
- I see.

184
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:25,291
- Betty says she'll stay here.

185
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:26,333
- Puck!

186
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:30,083
<i>- Betty can't go</i>
<i>with you, I suppose.</i>

187
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:31,333
<i>I'll simply wait here</i>
<i>for you to return.</i>

188
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:34,500
<i>There's no need</i>
<i>to worry about me.</i>

189
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:37,125
- So that's that.

190
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:38,750
Of course, in Betty's case,

191
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:41,208
the forbidden library
is a safer place to be anyway.

192
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:43,958
And besides, she can't
leave
the grounds of the mansion

193
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:44,916
due to her contract.

194
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,750
You know that, right, Lia?

195
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:50,250
- She's using that
as a reason? Great.

196
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:51,375
- So since my cute little sister

197
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:54,416
will be staying here
and can look after things,

198
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,833
I don't think we should
do anything to the mansion.

199
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:58,208
Betty is kind and sweet,
of course,

200
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:00,583
but she'll show no mercy
to intruders.

201
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,208
- Understood, great spirit.

202
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:02,791
We shall heed your words.

203
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,291
- [grunts]

204
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:06,333
- [gasps]

205
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:09,041
- Either way, you should do
whatever you wanna do.

206
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:11,666
Never forget what I told you.

207
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,666
I'm on your side,
and yours alone.

208
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:18,833
- We will evacuate.

209
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:20,666
The villagers need protection.

210
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,416
I don't want to put them
in any danger.

211
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:25,083
- [chuckles]

212
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:32,125
- We're all packed up, Lady.

213
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:34,083
Ready when you are.

214
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:35,791
- Wait. What?

215
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:38,708
Sorry, but I think there
may have been a mistake.

216
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:41,041
- Not at all. Given the number
of people and carriages,

217
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,291
to expedite the process,

218
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,333
we ask you to share a ride
with these children.

219
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:48,083
It's a necessary measure.

220
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:50,166
- Can't we put them
in a different carriage?

221
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,750
Think that would be better,
for the children, that is.

222
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:55,875
- You think no one would want
to ride with you? Is that it?

223
00:09:55,958 --> 00:10:00,333
Tell me, have you asked the kids
how they feel about that?

224
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:02,666
Perhaps you just assumed
they hate you

225
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,083
and wouldn't want
to be around you

226
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:06,708
without any actual discussion
on the matter.

227
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:08,416
- No, that's not what I--

228
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,500
I don't need
to ask them to know.

229
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:13,791
I'm certain it would be best
for all of us.

230
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:15,833
- Six children
in one dragon-drawn carriage.

231
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:20,958
If we stumble here, how
will
your wish ever come true?

232
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,291
- Do I know you?

233
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:26,333
- What do you think, Petra?

234
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:27,458
Do you have anything
against taking a ride

235
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:30,875
in the same carriage
as this lady here?

236
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:32,625
- [sighs]

237
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,791
- No, of course not.
- [gasps]

238
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:36,958
- I know her.

239
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:39,208
You're the lady with
the potato stamps, aren't you?

240
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:41,750
The same one who always
came along with Subaru

241
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:44,375
to watch when we'd do
our exercises.

242
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:45,791
- Well, I, uh...

243
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:48,208
- You didn't say much,
but I know it was you.

244
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:49,666
We couldn't see your face,

245
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,875
but we saw you having
a good time talking with him.

246
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:52,875

00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:56,791
- Please come and ride with us.

00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:58,708
- [gasps]

250
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,250
- It'll be fun.

251
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:02,708
- Yeah, I wanna
ride with you, too.

252
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:04,833
- Come on. Let's go, already.

253
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:05,958
- [children laughing]
- Let's go!

254
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:07,875
- Come with us.

255
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,916
- It's gonna be
pulled by a dragon!

256
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,291
- [children laughing]
- That's so cool!

257
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:14,708
[Petra laughs]

258
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:18,125
- Ram, take care of things
at the Sanctuary.

259
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:20,041
Be sure to protect
the villagers.

260
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:21,291
- Of course, Miss Emilia.

261
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:22,791
You take care as well.

262
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:23,708
- And, whoever you are,

263
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:26,791
I'd like to thank you
for helping me to--

264
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:29,208
Huh? Where did he go?

265
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,250
- [sighs]

[wind blowing]

267
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:40,750
- SUBARU: Now I get it.
- Huh?

268
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:43,250
- We couldn't figure out
how you guys stayed in touch.

269
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:45,791
Those metia sure are handy,
aren't they?

270
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:46,833
- [blow strikes]
- Huh? [gasps]

271
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:49,375
- There's a heavy price to pay

272
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,333
for the crime of interrupting

273
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:53,958
my touching and long-awaited
reunion with Emilia.

274
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:55,208
- [gasps] You're...

[swords slash]

276
00:11:58,083 --> 00:11:59,041
- Too slow.

- [groans]

278
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:04,958
- Guess by now you've realized

279
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:06,458
we've had you pegged
as a spy for some time.

280
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:09,666
How we found out
is a little trade secret.

281
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:12,791
So knowing you were the contact
for the Witch's Cult,

282
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:15,583
we laid out this trap
just for you.

283
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:17,333
Two hours.

284
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:20,125
You gave your buddies
a schedule

285
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:22,708
that was two hours
behind the real time frame.

286
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:25,416
We can use that time to get
Emilia and the others out,

287
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,791
raid this forest,

288
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:29,291
and crush the fingers
that know our location,

289
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:31,000
then make
the proper preparations

290
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,958
to wipe out your Sin Archbishop
once and for all.

291
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:37,750
The feeling of your enemy
always being one step
ahead,

292
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:40,041
you're about to learn
just how terrifying it is

293
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:41,125
to be in that position.

294
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:43,916
[music playing]

295
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:47,708
- Please be careful.

296
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:50,083
May the blessings
of the spirits be with you.

- [gasps]

298
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:58,625
- May you prevail.

299
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:01,583
- So this is what enabled you
to deceive Miss Emilia

300
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:03,333
and chase her
out of harm's way, huh?

301
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,833
- [groans] Come on!

302
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:06,958
Don't put it like that!

303
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:09,250
Even if it's accurate,
it makes me sound bad.

304
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:12,333
- That robe has been
woven
with quite a peculiar
spell.

305
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,958
- [sighs] It's a handmade item
by Roswaal.

306
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:17,041
Apparently there's
a spell laced into it

307
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:18,791
that prevents recognition.

308
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:20,041
Originally it was Emilia's,
but I--

309
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:21,833
[gasps]

310
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:23,916
Look, I didn't steal it, okay?!

311
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,958
- Sure.

312
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:28,208
What a day, huh?

313
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:29,833
Things are looking up for you.

314
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:31,291
The mistake
with the blank letter,

315
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:32,416
correcting that worked out well.

316
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:40,875
RAM:<i> The letter was a mistake.</i>

317
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:42,125
<i>It was all my fault.</i>

318
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:45,416
- And all of those
doubtful villagers,

319
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,125
you worked hard
to convince them, Subaru.

How wondrous,

The Witch wouldn't want

You are absolutely right.

Yes, of course. The Ordeal!

415
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:26,375
What she needs from me
right now is the Ordeal.

[yelps]

- Thank you. Thank you.
- Uh...

419
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:36,625
- With this Ordeal,
we must test her

420
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:39,625
and find out if this half-devil
is good enough,

421
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:43,125
if she is a worthy vessel
to put the Witch into.

Worthy vessel?

424
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:48,250
- If she is worthy,

425
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:49,083
the Witch will possess her.

426
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:52,250
If she is not,
the Witch will reject her.

427
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:56,250
If she proves a worthy vessel,
then the Witch will be reborn

428
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:59,208
into this world
on the coming fated day.

429

You're saying
Emilia is secondary,

431

with no value to you at all?

You monster.

All of it guides me
down this glorious path!

436

How can your eyes
see my Authority?!

- No idea.
Maybe you should ask the Witch

458
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:09,250
who left her scent all over me
for the answer to that
question.

Oh, that's right.

letting you meet with the
Witch
anytime you want, have you?

- [gasps] What do you mean?
How dare you speak

463
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:20,416
as though you are intimate
with the Witch, imposter?!

464

- I'm not lying.

465
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:24,625
We're so close,
she's grabbed my heart...

Thanks, though.
I thought I was a goner.

That cannot be! It's impossible!

It's a place

But this go-around,

are truly master and servant.

00:26:26,291 --> 00:26:29,166
I can see the same thing
in your eyes

642
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:30,708
that I see in his.

643
00:26:31,916 --> 00:26:32,875

644
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,333
Thank you, Wilhelm.

This cannot be!

You cannot use such means,
such evil tricks

to make light of me
and my undying devotion!

where, as soon
as you're caught, it's over.

We must be out of our minds to

Shall we speed up?

Don't worry about me!

Awesome.

so we could take the villagers

Once we did, we noticed
that the stones were missing.

it means somebody

left them on board when they
loaded the villagers.

in Ketty's carriage,

753
00:31:49,333 --> 00:31:51,083
and there are
enough magic stones

Ketty's carriage is the one

00:32:20,666 --> 00:32:22,666
Now come on.
We need to get going.

767
00:32:29,208 --> 00:32:30,625
- Damn it! Just when I think

768
00:32:30,708 --> 00:32:33,583
we've got it all under control,
everything backfires!

769
00:32:33,666 --> 00:32:36,375
- We verified that no spell
was used to set a trap,

770
00:32:36,458 --> 00:32:38,500
but if something were physically
rigged in the carriage,

771
00:32:38,583 --> 00:32:41,000
there's be no way of knowing
without seeing it.

772
00:32:41,083 --> 00:32:41,750
- Hey, Felix,
would a ground dragon

773
00:32:41,833 --> 00:32:44,708
be fast enough
to catch up with them?

774
00:32:44,791 --> 00:32:46,541
- If they're already
out of the Mathers domain

775
00:32:46,625 --> 00:32:48,041
and on the Lifaus Highway,

776
00:32:48,125 --> 00:32:50,250
then I think
it'd be pretty difficult.

777
00:32:50,333 --> 00:32:52,208
- That still wasn't enough?

778
00:32:52,291 --> 00:32:55,291
Even after everything we did,
I still can't...

779
00:32:55,375 --> 00:32:57,791
- Excuse me.
May I say something?

780
00:32:57,875 --> 00:33:00,750
I'm actually in a bit of
a desperate position right now.

781
00:33:00,833 --> 00:33:03,750
If you'd be willing
to accept a trade

782
00:33:03,833 --> 00:33:06,125
and help me out, I promise
to catch up to the carriage--

783
00:33:06,208 --> 00:33:09,625
If there's anything I can do
to make that happen, I'll do
it!

784
00:33:09,708 --> 00:33:12,333
- I like a man who can make
quick decisions, Mr. Natsuki.

785
00:33:12,416 --> 00:33:13,416
Thanks so much.

786
00:33:15,375 --> 00:33:18,208
- I'll send Ia along with you.
That should help.

787
00:33:18,291 --> 00:33:20,583
I wish I could
accompany you myself, but I...

788
00:33:20,666 --> 00:33:21,500
- You can't, Julius.

789
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:23,583
With all those injuries,

790
00:33:23,666 --> 00:33:25,458
what other help
could you possibly offer?

791
00:33:25,541 --> 00:33:27,458
And your mana's
not even restored yet.

792
00:33:27,541 --> 00:33:29,375
- You just get some rest, okay?

793
00:33:29,458 --> 00:33:31,208
Once this things finally over,
we can all celebrate.

794
00:33:31,291 --> 00:33:34,375
And I'll even make sure
to invite you, so don't die.

795
00:33:34,458 --> 00:33:36,458
- Don't you die, either.
Best of luck to you!

796
00:33:36,541 --> 00:33:38,208
- Careful out there.

797
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:41,708
OTTO: Instead of
taking this path,

798
00:33:41,791 --> 00:33:44,333
it's faster if we go off-road

799
00:33:44,416 --> 00:33:46,083
and cut through
the glade on the left.

800

and people,
so many people hate me

because I look like the Witch.

Those guys are completely blind.

1137

- I don't have much experience
with people,

1138
00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:50,500
so I don't have friends.

1139

I'm naive and not worldly,

so I say strange things
sometimes.

is really, really selfish.

no matter what you
happen to think of yourself,

I love you with all my heart.

You could sit there

that I love about you.

I want to give you.

Why 2,000?

just isn't enough,

that a day like this
would happen,

when someone
would tell me they loved me.

You've told me so many

I'm thankful,

I don't know what I'm supposed
to do at a time like this.

You don't have
to stress over it.

I'm not demanding
an answer right away.

and I'm confident
of what that answer will be.

1179
00:50:26,375 --> 00:50:27,583
- Really? I mean...

1180
00:50:27,666 --> 00:50:31,750
is it okay for someone like me

1181

to be given such pure happiness
all the time?

1182
00:50:35,166 --> 00:50:37,583
To know such joy
in my heart that it--

1183
00:50:37,666 --> 00:50:39,458
it actually feels
beyond indulgent?

- Sure it is.
Go on and be indulgent.

00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:19,458
but please hear me out.

1279
00:56:19,541 --> 00:56:22,125
And of course
it goes without saying

1280
00:56:22,208 --> 00:56:23,750
that I am completely prepared

1281
00:56:23,833 --> 00:56:26,416
to be knocked out by Ram
when I tell her!

1282
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:29,000
But I wanted you
to hear it first.

1283
00:56:29,083 --> 00:56:30,041
- [grunts]

1284
00:56:32,041 --> 00:56:35,791
- This is--
This is actually about Rem.

1285
00:56:35,875 --> 00:56:38,125
She--She said that, uh...

1286
00:56:38,208 --> 00:56:39,291
<i>- And you'll still</i>
<i>keep me by your side,</i>

1287
00:56:39,375 --> 00:56:42,750
<i>no matter where you go</i>
<i>from now on?</i>

1288
00:56:42,833 --> 00:56:45,750
- S-So you see
what I'm getting at, right?

1289
00:56:45,833 --> 00:56:48,083
I mean, well, Rem said

1290
00:56:48,166 --> 00:56:50,750
some really nice things
to me, and, uh...

1291
00:56:50,833 --> 00:56:52,916
- Easy, Subaru. Just calm down.

1292
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,875
Now, I'm not exactly sure
what you're trying to say to me,

1293
00:56:54,958 --> 00:56:57,666
but I can tell it means a lot

1294
00:56:57,750 --> 00:56:59,125
and you're trying your hardest
to say it, okay?

1295
00:56:59,208 --> 00:57:02,833
Just take it slow,
like a good boy.

1296
00:57:02,916 --> 00:57:05,958
- "Like a good boy," huh?
Not exactly encouraging.

1297
00:57:06,041 --> 00:57:07,666
But all right. Here goes.

1298
00:57:07,750 --> 00:57:08,875
[grunts]

1299
00:57:08,958 --> 00:57:10,000
Time for me to man up,

1300
00:57:10,083 --> 00:57:12,750
come right out, and say it!

1301
00:57:12,833 --> 00:57:14,125
You see...

1302
00:57:14,208 --> 00:57:15,958
the thing is,
Rem said that she loves me,

1303
00:57:16,041 --> 00:57:18,041
and she meant it in the same way
I told you that I love you!

1304
00:57:18,125 --> 00:57:19,916
All right, there! I said it!

1305
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,250
[steeds' footsteps rumbling]

1306
00:57:22,333 --> 00:57:25,166
[gasping]

1307
00:57:25,250 --> 00:57:27,250
[carriages rattling]

1308
00:57:31,875 --> 00:57:33,666
- Subaru.

1309
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:35,083
- Yes?

1310
00:57:38,041 --> 00:57:39,541
- I'm confused.

1311
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:44,041
Who is Rem?

1312
00:57:44,125 --> 00:57:45,041
- [gasps]

1313
00:57:46,125 --> 00:57:47,041
[shudders]
