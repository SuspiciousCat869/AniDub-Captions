00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:42,500
and lodged in the wall.

166
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:44,958
They disappeared quick though.
- I was too late.

167
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:47,500
I thought if I could keep
the insignia from being stolen

168
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:48,875
then maybe things wouldn't
have--

169
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:50,583
- What are you going on about?

170
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:52,625
- Oh, it's nothing important,
but, uh...

171
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:55,375
Thanks, mister.
Really.

172
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:57,875
You helped me even though
I didn't actually buy anything.

173
00:07:57,958 --> 00:07:59,666
- Ah, it's no big deal.

174
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:02,458
A broke kid a lot like yourself
just helped my daughter

175
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:04,541
after she got separated
from her mother earlier.

176
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:06,208
- [gasps]

177
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:08,875
I guess fate
is a compelling force, too.

178
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:10,375
Huh.
[chuckles]

179
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:13,291
- What are you smiling about?
- It's nothing.

180
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:15,875
I'll be sure to buy
an appa next time, okay?

181
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:16,916
- Sounds good.

182
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,375
Buy one
and you'll be a customer.

183
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:19,875
Get to work, broke boy!

184
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:22,208
See you!
- Later!

185
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,375
This means there's only one way.

186
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:27,083
I have to by the insignia
from felt before Elsa comes

187
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:28,750
to the loot house
and return it to Satella.

188
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:30,083
Wait.

189
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:32,500
Satella was just an alias
that she used, wasn't it?

190
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:36,208
Then I'm gonna need to do
whatever I can this time around

191
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:38,416
to make sure she tells me
what her real name actually is.

192
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,583
[grunts]

193
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,250
- What are you going on
and on about?

194
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:44,416
- If you don't want
to get hurt,

195
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,416
then cough up
whatever you've got.

196
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,083
- Listen Dumb, Dumber,
and Dumberest.

197
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:50,125
I'm getting sick
of seeing your faces.

198
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:52,250
After doing this four times,
I've learned my lesson.

199
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:53,583
all: Huh?

200
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,708
- [inhales]

201
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:01,750
Guards, help me!

202
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,791
- What the hell, you bastard?

203
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:04,791
- [chuckles]

204
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:05,791
<i>It seems my memory</i>

205
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:07,250
<i>from before was right.</i>

206
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:10,125
<i>This world does have</i>
<i>some kind of police force.</i>

207
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:12,750
Someone!
[gasping]

208
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:14,625
Please, I need a man!

209
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:15,625
- Damn it.
Shut up!

210
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:17,541
- No, don't touch me!
Stop!

211
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:19,958
I can't hear you!
You're not being sincere enough!

212
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:23,458
Someone please help me!
Please!

213
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:24,500
Huh?

214
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:26,583
- Don't scare me like that.

215
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,791
All that yelling
freaked me out a little bit.

216
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:30,291
- Just a little bit, though.

217
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:32,291
- Yeah, just a teeny
tiny little bit.

218
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:34,125
- [stammers]

219
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:36,375
- Trying to run away
won't help you.

220
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:38,416
- [winces]

221
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,375
- That's enough.

222
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:41,000
[all grunting]

223
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:47,500
- Red hair and a knight's sword
with scratches made

224
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:49,000
by dragon cloth.

225
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:52,500
Can that be Reinhard?

226
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:54,666
The master swordsman?

227
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:57,791
- Looks like I don't need
to introduce myself.

228
00:09:58,583 --> 00:09:59,833
Thought to be honest,

229
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:01,333
that nickname
is a bit much for me.

230
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:02,416
I don't know how much help

231
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,125
my modest strength
can be to him,

232
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:06,541
but if you wish to resort
to extreme measures,

233
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:07,875
let me warn you.

234
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:10,958
As a knight,
I will have to fight back.

235
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:13,208
- S--screw this business.

236
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:14,333
It's not worth it!

237
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:19,083
[all shouting]

238
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:21,166
Glad we both came out
of that unscathed.

239
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,583
Lucky break, huh?

240
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:24,791
- [grunting]

241
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:27,583
Uh, allow me to thank you
from the bottom of my heart.

242
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:28,708
You helped me out without
ever once giving it

243
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:30,208
a second thought.

244
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:33,250
I, Subaru Natsuki,
deeply admired your selfless act

245
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:35,541
of bravery and kindness.
- Hey, come on now.

246
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:37,541
There's no need
for such formality.

247
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:39,250
Once it was two
of us against three,

248
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:41,916
those thugs lost their advantage
on the situation.

249
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,166
Things might have been different
if I were alone.

250
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,666
<i>- Wow, his nice guy index</i>
<i>is off the charts.</i>

251
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,000
- [chuckles]

252
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:49,750
- [grunts]

253
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:54,083
So your Master
Swordsman Reinhard, right?

254
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:55,583
- It's Reinhard, Subaru.

255
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:57,125
Just Reinhard.

256
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:59,583
<i>- We went from zero</i>
<i>to buddy-buddy fast.</i>

257
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:02,333
Well, thanks again Reinhard.
I appreciate it.

258
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:04,791
I shouted for help over
and over but you're the only one

259
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:06,208
who answered my call.

260
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,375
I'm so pathetic.
- Hmm.

261
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:09,833
Don't be so down on yourself.

262
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:11,000
For most it's too risky

263
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:13,125
to face off
against people like them.

264
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:15,083
Listen, as far as I'm concerned,

265
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:16,708
you were right
to call for the guards.

266
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:18,083
- [grunts]

267
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:20,916
So would that make you a guard,
then?

268
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,583
You don't look like one.

269
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:24,666
- Well, today I happened
to be off duty,

270
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,250
so I'm not in
the standard uniform

271
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:27,458
and I know I don't look

272
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:29,916
particularly
intimidating either way.

273
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,916
- But they did call you
master swordsman, didn't they?

274
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,958
So--

275
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:36,083
- My family is a bit unique.

276
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:37,958
Most of the time
I don't feel like

277
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:40,000
I live up to their expectations.

278
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:42,333
Anyway, Subaru.
- Hmm?

279
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:43,750
- Your name,
your clothes,

280
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:46,083
and that haircut are unusual.

281
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:48,000
What nation are you from?

282
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:52,000
at the moment Lugunica is a bit
more on edge than in peacetime.

283
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:53,625
If you're having
problems while you're here,

284
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:55,583
I'm happy to
help out in any way I can

285
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:56,791
- [grunts]
Would you come

286
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:59,125
to the loot house with me?
- What?

287
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:03,625
- Uh, never mind.
forget about it.

288
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:06,791
I don't want to bother you,
especially on your day off.

289
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:09,041
I'll handle the rest
of this on my own somehow.

290
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:10,375
[chuckles]

291
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:13,791
But I'd appreciate it
if you could deliver

292
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:14,958
a message for me.

293
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:16,208
- Of course,
I'd be glad to.

294
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:19,125
What would you like me
to say and to whom?

295
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:21,291
- Well,
I don't exactly know her name,

296
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:24,125
but have you seen
a girl with white robes

297
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:25,916
and silver hair
around here lately?

298
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:29,291
- White robes
and silver hair, huh?

299
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:32,041
- Oh, he's also
exceptionally beautiful.

300
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:35,250
- No, it doesn't ring a bell.

301
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:37,125
- Well, if you do happen
to see her,

302
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:38,500
tell her not to come near

303
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:40,583
the loot house no matter what.

304
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:42,375
I'll find what she's been
looking for

305
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:43,625
and bring it to her myself.

306
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:45,166
No problem at all.
Okay?

307
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:46,833
- Very well, then.

308
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:49,666
If I see her then I'll be sure
to relay your message.

309
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,208
- Thanks a lot.

310
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:54,708
I'll repay you one day.
[grunts]

311
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,833
- Sure.
Take care.

312
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:01,666
[birds cawing]

313
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,666
- You're looking for Felts den,
huh?

314
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:04,833
You're close.

315
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:05,875
Just head straight this way

316
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:08,291
another two blocks or so.
- Great.

317
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:10,041
Thanks.
I appreciate it, man.

318
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:11,875
- Hey, not a problem at all,
kid.

319
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,958
Now live strong
and take care.

320
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:16,250
- The question is whether Felt
will come back there

321
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:17,375
before the meeting.

322
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:18,875
I'd rather catch up
with her before

323
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:20,166
she makes her way

than 20 holy coins.

I want to buy
your insignia with it.

that's in high demand nowadays.

This little number
is a one-of-a-kind item

428
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:18,916
that can capture
and freeze a moment in time.

to be lying,

I look much prettier than that.

I'll give you that much.

to do is have it appraised

[grunts]

1114
00:45:32,875 --> 00:45:35,125
I suppose he's like my grandpa.

1115
00:45:35,208 --> 00:45:36,833
- I see.

1116
00:45:36,916 --> 00:45:39,125
I only have one
family member, too.

1117
00:45:39,208 --> 00:45:41,916
He's always asleep at the most
important moments, though.

1118
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,166
'Course, I wouldn't say that
out loud when he's awake.

1119
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:46,125
I'd never hear the end of it.

1120
00:45:46,208 --> 00:45:47,375
- Considering what I did,

1121
00:45:47,458 --> 00:45:49,500
I figured you'd be
a lot harder on me.

1122
00:45:50,958 --> 00:45:53,958
You saved my life back there
and I can't let a debt go unpaid

1123
00:45:54,041 --> 00:45:56,291
so I'll return
what I stole from you, okay?

1124
00:45:56,958 --> 00:45:59,333
If it's important,
I suggest you keep it hidden

1125
00:45:59,416 --> 00:46:00,916
so no one can steal it again.

1126
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,875
- I appreciate the advice,
though it's a little strange

1127
00:46:02,958 --> 00:46:04,708
to hear it from you.

1129

- What are you doing?
- Hey, you're hurting me.

1130
00:46:11,166 --> 00:46:12,750
Let go of my arm.

1131
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,458
- [gasps]
This can't be possible.

1132
00:46:15,541 --> 00:46:17,208
What's your name?
- Huh?

1133
00:46:17,291 --> 00:46:18,541
It's Felt.
Why do--

1134
00:46:18,625 --> 00:46:21,083
- Family name,
and just how old are you?

1135
00:46:21,166 --> 00:46:24,500
- Look I don't have anything
fancy like a family name.

1136
00:46:24,583 --> 00:46:27,333
I'm about 15,
if I had to guess.

1137
00:46:27,416 --> 00:46:28,916
I don't know my birthday.

1138
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,291
Just let me go.
- Sorry, Miss Amelia,

1139
00:46:31,375 --> 00:46:34,583
but I'm afraid that I can't keep
my promise to you at this time.

1140
00:46:34,916 --> 00:46:37,291
I'll be taking this girl
with me for further questioning.

1141
00:46:37,583 --> 00:46:39,125
- May I ask you why?

1142
00:46:39,208 --> 00:46:41,500
If it's just for stealing
my insignia, then--

1143
00:46:41,583 --> 00:46:44,875
- That's left alone
is no small crime, certainly,

1144
00:46:44,958 --> 00:46:46,625
but if I overlook what's
unfolding before me

1145
00:46:46,708 --> 00:46:47,750
at this moment,

1146
00:46:47,833 --> 00:46:49,041
I know it would be
the greatest crime

1147
00:46:49,125 --> 00:46:50,375
of them all.

1148
00:46:50,458 --> 00:46:51,958
I'll need you
to come along with me.

1149
00:46:52,041 --> 00:46:53,583
I'm sorry,
but I simply can't allow you

1150
00:46:53,666 --> 00:46:55,625
to refuse.
- Get over yourself.

1151
00:46:55,708 --> 00:46:58,291
Just because
you saved me doesn't mean you--

1152
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:02,041
- That little move didn't seem
very knightly, either.

1153
00:47:02,125 --> 00:47:03,958
- I was careful not
to use too much.

1154
00:47:04,041 --> 00:47:05,041
Miss Amelia,

1155
00:47:05,125 --> 00:47:06,375
I will most likely be calling

1156
00:47:06,458 --> 00:47:08,125
upon you again very soon.

1157
00:47:08,958 --> 00:47:10,750
I hope you understand.

1158
00:47:13,541 --> 00:47:16,750
Please take good care of Subaru.
He's been through a lot.
