00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:29,541
then I'm sure the boy faces
quite a bumpy road ahead.

163
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,375
- Hey, uh, Mili?

164
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:37,333
Maybe we should stop doing this.

Absolutely not.

in the village,

179
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:07,291
you were the one who wanted
to hold hands so desperately.

180
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:09,541

and mentally prepared

Reinhard's expression went dark
and he took the girl away.

- When you say it like that,

198
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:46,708
it sounds like kidnapping
or an abduction

- If we want
to contact Reinhard,

00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:54,833
then we should probably go
to the guard station

I wanted to ask you about
the royal selection

206
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:01,625
that starts up tomorrow.
- Don't start, Subaru.

We discussed this thoroughly
before going

And you also seem well, Julius.

And I must say,

221

but I have business here,

for the warning.

And while we're on the subject,

235
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:09,041
I've got a warning
for you, too.

236
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:11,666
You shouldn't eat curry udon
in that suit.

237
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:12,791
If the soup splatters,

this curry udon is,

keep that in mind.

It isn't three-on-two.

00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:17,375
- Whoa, really?

320
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:19,750
Well, I guess I shouldn't
have butted in, then.

321
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:21,583
Sorry to interfere.

322
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:23,083
- Oh, by the way, boy,

323
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:25,541
is there any chance you know
where Felt went off to?

324
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:26,791
- Wait a minute.

325
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:28,041
You mean you didn't
hear about what happened?

326
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:29,875
Apparently Reinhard
took her away.

327
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:31,958
- Now why would he do that?

328
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:34,375
Well, don't that beat all?

329
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:36,208
Had to be an Astrea, huh?

330
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:38,458
- Something wrong?

331
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:40,916
- No, no, I'm just talking
to myself.

332
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Now you try not to cause
any more trouble

333
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:44,583
around these parts,
you hear?

334
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:46,041
- S--sure.

335
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:50,583
- There you are.
- [grunts]

336
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:52,333
- Oh, hey, Mili.

337
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:54,166
Wait, wait, wait!

338
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,875
You can't just go and hit on
Mili while I'm away, you jerk!

339
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:00,875
- Looks like your buddy's got
a screw loose, little lady.

340
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:02,958
He's more worried about losing
you to another guy

341
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:04,416
than happy to see you.

342
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,333
The man's heart is so complex,
it's a thrill to watch.

343
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:09,500
- You've got a pretty messed up
fashion sense,

344
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:10,958
don't you, Mr. Helmet?

345
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:13,166
- Now, that's no way to talk
to someone.

346
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:16,166
I can overlook that since
I'm a cool, good-natured man,

347
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,583
but some might lop off
your head for that.

348
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:20,250
- Easy.
Relax, Subaru.

349
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:21,875
I admit when I first saw him,

350
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:23,833
his outfit surprised me
a little, too.

351
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:26,958
- Yeah, well, I was surprised
when she asked for my help

352
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:28,666
while I was looking
for a lost child.

353
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,333
So there's that.

354
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:32,583
- You're way too soft-hearted
and trusting.

355
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:34,916
Most people would think that
a guy dressed like this

356
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,166
who's looking for a lost child

357
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,625
is gonna kidnap them.

358
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:39,083
- My, my.

359
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:40,458
How very attentive of you

360
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:41,958
to wait where you knew
I would be.

361
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:44,041
I commend you for your
dedication, Al.

362
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:46,041
- You mean you were
the lost child?

363
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:47,416
- [scoffs]

364
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:48,750
- [grunts]

365
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:51,666
- Well, what do you know?

366
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,750
Looks like we both found just
who we were looking for.

367
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:55,166
Let's go.
- Just a moment.

368
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:57,666
Would you mind telling me what
you have in that bag?

369
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,250
- These are appas.

370
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:00,791
Haven't you ever
seen one before?

371
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:02,208
- Please, don't make me laugh.

372
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:04,125
Everyone knows appas
have white flesh.

373
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:06,791
- Well, I mean, yeah,
the insides are white, but--

374
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:09,041
hang on, are you trying
to tell me you've never seen

375
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:10,583
an unpeeled appa?

376
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:17,750
Here you go.

377
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,125
Now don't go skipping off

378
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:21,875
after any obvious
bad guys again, okay?

379
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:26,083
- Subaru,
that girl from before.

380
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:27,416
- Huh?

381
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:31,500
I was wondering where you happen
to have met her and how.

382
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,041
- Huh?
What's this?

383
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:34,583
Are you jealous, Mili?

384
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:37,500
I can't believe you're actually
feeling that way over me--

385
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:39,500
or--
- Subaru.

386
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:44,083
- Uh, Mili, what's
with the serious face?

387
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:46,583
It's freaking me out a little.
- [gasps]

388
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:49,250
Nothing.
If you don't know, it's fine.

389
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:50,500
Forget about it.

390
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:52,083
- [grunts]

391
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:57,958
- [chomps]

392
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:01,375
Oh, wow.
I guess this thing

393
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:02,500
really is an appa.

394
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:06,083
<i>- What?</i>
<i>I have to stay here tomorrow?</i>

395
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:07,875
- Yes, of course you do.

396
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:10,000
That was our agreement
from the very beginning.

397
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:11,416
- Well, that was the plan,

398
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,375
but we never got in touch
with Reinhard, right?

399
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:15,541
If we go to the castle
together tomorrow,

400
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:17,416
we might run into him.
- There's no need.

401
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,125
I'll be sure to ask about Felt.

402
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:21,208
- I really think I should go
in person to--

403
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:23,375
- This is the reason
I can't take you with me.

404
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:24,958
If I allow you to do so,

405
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:27,166
you'll just push yourself
too hard again.

406
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,500
I don't want to let you do that.
Understand?

407
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:30,875
- I hear what you're saying,

408
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:32,458
but you're the one
who doesn't understand.

409
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:34,000
If I have to push myself
to help you,

410
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:35,500
then I'll do it without
a second thought.

411
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,458
I've gotta at least try.

412
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,000
- Absolutely not.

413
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,833
Until your body fully heals,

414
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:45,416
there is to be no using magic
or pushing yourself.

415
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,416
I want you to promise, okay?

416
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:51,416
- Okay, you win.
I promise you.

417
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,000
I won't use magic.

418
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:56,000
Either way,
let me go with you!

419
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:58,750
- I can't bring an outsider
into this.

420
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:02,416
So please, just wait here
with Rem until it's over,

421
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,416
all right?
- [grunts]

422
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:09,416
[grunts]

423
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:12,125
- I'm asking you, Subaru.

424
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:14,291
Give me a reason to trust you.

425
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,375
<i>- I know there are those</i>
<i>in the capitol</i>

426
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:25,458
<i>who consider Emilia an enemy.</i>

427
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:29,625
<i>That's exactly why I have</i>
<i>to stay close to her.</i>

428
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:32,708
- What's the matter?

429
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:35,916
- I'm going to save Emilia.
- Huh?

430
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,041
- And to do that...
- [gasps]

431
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:41,000
<i>- [stare]</i>

432
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:42,958
- Wh--what is it, Subaru?

433
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:45,375
It makes me feel uncomfortable
when you stare at me

434
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:48,458
with such imposing eyes.
<i>- Stare.</i>

435
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:54,833
- [sighs[

436
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:56,500
It's at the castle,

437
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:59,166
although most likely there
will be heavy security.

438
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,250
- Security isn't the problem.

439
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:04,791
I can't stand not being involved
in Emilia's important affairs.

440
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:07,083
- I know, but--
- When it comes down to it,

441
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:09,666
I'm only of any use
when something happens.

442
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:13,458
I want to be with her at a time
when she may need me the most.

443
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:14,750
- [gasps]

444
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:16,208
[grunts]

445
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:19,333
I'm going to set about making
a brand new appa recipe

446
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:21,625
that I just came up with
this very moment.

447
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:23,541
- What?
- And this culinary adventure

448
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:25,583
requires intense concentration,

449
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:27,416
so if someone were
to leave his room,

450
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,333
I most likely wouldn't notice.

451
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:32,833
<i>- I'm such a scumbag</i>

452
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:34,708
<i>for relying on Rem</i>
<i>all the time.</i>

453
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:41,333
<i>But now the problem</i>
<i>is how I'm going</i>

454
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:42,916
<i>to get into the castle.</i>

455
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:47,625
I guess times like these call
for hitchhiking!

456
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:51,166
[dragon roars]

457
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,875
- You sure are lucky, bro.

458
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:55,625
Be grateful
for this coincidence.

459
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:58,208
We just happened to be on our
way to the castle, too.

460
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:00,708
- You are?
Why's that?

461
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:02,083
- What do you mean?

462
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:04,541
Today there's only one reason
to head to the castle.

463
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:06,958
- Huh?
- Oh, you didn't know?

464
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,750
The young lady who's seated
before you is one

465
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:12,750
of the candidates to succeed
to the throne of Lugunica.

466
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:15,541
Priscilla Barielle herself.

467
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:16,791
- Whoa, seriously?

468
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:18,541
So why did you pick me up?

469
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:21,375
- For no other reason than
it seemed amusing.

470
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:23,500
A mere lark, nothing more.

471
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:25,833
I simply have a feeling that
taking you in there

472
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:28,125
will make things
a bit more interesting.

473
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,750
- Why do you think that?

474
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:32,000
- This world is designed
to operate

475
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:34,083
in the way that works best
for me.

476
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:36,041
So with every choice I make,

477
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:39,083
it's a given that all things
will be in my favor.

478
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:40,458
In the end,

479
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:41,916
it's only a matter of choosing

480
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,041
whether something amuses me
or not.

481
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:45,291
- [gasps]

482
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:47,708
- However, if I had to name
a reason,

483
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:50,000
other than amusement...
- Huh?

484
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:55,041
- Did you say your appa handler?

485
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:56,416
- Indeed.

486
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,583
He's something
of a wretched clown

487
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:01,458
whose sole priority is to bring
me bittersweet appas

488
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:03,458
whenever I fancy one.

489
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:04,666
- [grunts]

490
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,000
- [stammers]

491
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:08,875
- Everyone is waiting inside.

492
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,916
So please make haste.

493
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,458
- As their superior,

494
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:14,583
I like to keep
the masses waiting.

495
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:17,875
[doors creaking]

496
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:26,791
- [gasps]

497
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:33,416
Subaru?

498
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,875
- Emilia.

499
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:36,541
I can explain.

500
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:38,250
- [giggles]

501
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:41,250
Is there a reason you're staring
at my man servant?

502
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:42,625
It's rude to gawk,
you halfwit.

503
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:45,500
- Get off!
You'll give Mili the wrong idea!

504
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:48,625
- My, how nice to see you,
Miss Priscilla!

505
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:50,375
I do hope you'll forgive
my servant

506
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:52,375
for troubling you so.
- Hmm.

507
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:59,166
- What in the world are you
doing here, Subaru?

508
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:03,416
Thought I told you you were
supposed to wait for me.

509
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,583
You remember that,
don't you?

510
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:10,125
- Attention, the council
of wise men will now enter.

511
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:17,833
- So that's the council
of wise men, huh?

512
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:19,041
If I remember correctly,

513
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:20,666
they're the people managing
the country

514
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,166
in the king's absence,
aren't they?

515
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:24,791
- Hey, that's where we're
supposed to stand.

516
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:26,500
- You mean I can stand there,
too?

517
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:28,208
- Well, what do we have here?

518
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:31,541
I find this situation amusing,
so you may accompany him.

519
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:32,833
- Wait, Roswaal!

520
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,500
If Subaru's allowed
to stay here,

521
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:36,666
I'm sure that he'll--
- Miss Emilia.

522
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,458
The conference is beginning now.

523
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:40,333
We can't make them wait.
- [gasps]

524
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:48,083
Move to the center,

525
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:49,625
but you're going
to explain this to me later.

526
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:51,375
- [grunts]

527
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:54,833
So those are the participants
in the royal selection.

528
00:21:54,916 --> 00:21:57,041
Guess one of them will be
the future ruler

529
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:58,208
of this country.

530
00:21:58,291 --> 00:22:01,041
- So you decided to come
after all, Subaru.

531
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:02,125
When I heard through
the grapevine

532
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:03,750
that Miss Emilia would be here,

533
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:06,291
I had a rather strong suspicion
that you would be here as well.

534
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:07,625
- Hey, Reinhard.

535
00:22:07,708 --> 00:22:08,750
I've been looking for you.

536
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:10,208
- Oh, how's it going?

537
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:11,791
- You, too?
- [laughs]

538
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:12,875
- Oh, Subaru.

539
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:14,208
You know him, I take it?

540
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,583
- Huh?
Know "him?"

541
00:22:15,666 --> 00:22:17,125
- That's right.
He's a knight

542
00:22:17,208 --> 00:22:18,625
by the name of Felix Argyle.

543
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:20,833
and despite all appearances,
he is male.

544
00:22:20,916 --> 00:22:22,375
- You're kidding!

545
00:22:22,458 --> 00:22:24,583
What's the point in looking like
that and even having cat ears

546
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:27,208
if you're a guy?
- I don't nyow what to tell you.

547
00:22:27,291 --> 00:22:29,041
You're the one who made
the wrong assumption,

548
00:22:29,125 --> 00:22:31,000
silly Subaru.

549
00:22:35,666 --> 00:22:37,750
- [snarls]

550
00:22:37,833 --> 00:22:39,416
- Hey, Subaru,
what's the matter?

551
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,833
- Where I come from,

552
00:22:40,916 --> 00:22:43,000
this is the kind of face you
make whenever you run into a guy

553
00:22:43,083 --> 00:22:45,000
who's a romantic rival.

554
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:47,250
- Now if I may be so forward,

555
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:49,625
I Marcos,
leader of the Imperial Knights,

556
00:22:49,708 --> 00:22:52,500
will act as the director
for all of today's proceedings.

557
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:55,625
It all happened about half
a year ago

558
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:58,958
when members of the royal family
starting with the king

559
00:22:59,041 --> 00:23:01,458
went into hiding one
by one causing--

560
00:23:01,541 --> 00:23:03,791
- Listen, I get that you
wanna talk things up

561
00:23:03,875 --> 00:23:05,625
and put on a good show here,

562
00:23:05,708 --> 00:23:07,458
but I'm kinda busy, you know?

563
00:23:07,541 --> 00:23:08,791
You may not have heard it,

564
00:23:08,875 --> 00:23:10,750
but we have a saying back
in Kararagi.

565
00:23:10,833 --> 00:23:12,166
Time is money.

566
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:14,500
- That attitude seems familiar
but I can't place it.

567
00:23:14,583 --> 00:23:17,083
- Evidently everybody who's in
western Kararagi

568
00:23:17,166 --> 00:23:18,291
acts like that.

569
00:23:18,375 --> 00:23:19,541
- I couldn't agree more.

570
00:23:19,625 --> 00:23:20,916
- Miss Crusch,

571
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,291
should the head of the Karsten
family say such a thing?

572
00:23:23,375 --> 00:23:25,666
- I acknowledge it's important
to observe formality.

573
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:28,500
But it is also a fact
that our time is rather limited.

574
00:23:28,583 --> 00:23:31,458
So it would be wise
to immediately inform us

575
00:23:31,541 --> 00:23:32,958
as to why we're here.

576
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:35,958
Naturally, however,
I do have a general idea.

577
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:37,916
- Am I to understand
you already know

578
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,458
the purpose
of this meeting?

579
00:23:39,541 --> 00:23:41,750
- Yes, I do, lord Miklotov.

580
00:23:41,833 --> 00:23:43,166
For a drinking party.

581
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:45,750
One day soon we'll face each
other as rivals.

582
00:23:45,833 --> 00:23:47,500
But by sharing drinks
and conversing

583
00:23:47,583 --> 00:23:48,875
at the same table,

584
00:23:48,958 --> 00:23:51,291
we'll have a chance to learn
more about one another.

585
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:55,000
- No, ma'am.
That is not correct.

586
00:23:55,083 --> 00:23:56,875
- [grunts]
Felix.

587
00:23:56,958 --> 00:23:58,791
This is not what you
told me earlier.

588
00:23:58,875 --> 00:24:00,333
- What?
That's not true.

589
00:24:00,416 --> 00:24:02,791
All I said was maybe it'll be
a drinking party.

590
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:05,000
I never said I knew it
for a fact or anything.

591
00:24:05,083 --> 00:24:06,041
- I see.

592
00:24:06,125 --> 00:24:07,458
Then I jumped to conclusions.

593
00:24:07,541 --> 00:24:08,833
Forgive me.

594
00:24:08,916 --> 00:24:11,041
Please allow me to retract
everything I just said.

595
00:24:11,125 --> 00:24:12,250
- Now just a second.

596
00:24:12,333 --> 00:24:13,583
Even if she backs down,

597
00:24:13,666 --> 00:24:15,375
my opinion on this
isn't gonna change.

598
00:24:15,458 --> 00:24:18,416
There's no need to explain
the royal selection process now.

599
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,166
We already know how it works.

600
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:22,333
Am I right?
- Well, even so,

601
00:24:22,416 --> 00:24:23,750
I think maybe we should hear--

602
00:24:23,833 --> 00:24:25,875
- Sorry, but I don't remember
asking for your opinion

603
00:24:25,958 --> 00:24:27,000
on any of this business.

604
00:24:27,083 --> 00:24:28,666
- [grunts]
Why, you little--

605
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:29,916
- Hey!

606
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,958
I don't know what's up
with the royal selection,

607
00:24:32,041 --> 00:24:33,875
so I'd kinda like
to hear the rest.

608
00:24:33,958 --> 00:24:36,458
- Excuse me, but I was informed

609
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:38,958
that this young man
is your knight, Miss Priscilla.

610
00:24:39,041 --> 00:24:41,500
Haven't you explained
the selection to him?

611
00:24:41,583 --> 00:24:43,500
- Whether I have or not
holds no merit.

612
00:24:43,583 --> 00:24:46,000
You men will still ramble on
about it, won't you?

613
00:24:46,083 --> 00:24:48,125
Please continue, Marcos.

614
00:24:48,208 --> 00:24:49,666
- As you wish.

615
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:51,208
There's a specific reason

616
00:24:51,291 --> 00:24:52,750
we've gathered you
who are qualified

617
00:24:52,833 --> 00:24:54,208
to be the dragon's priestess.

618
00:24:54,291 --> 00:24:58,458
<i>A new prophecy has been engraved</i>
<i>in the Dragon Stone.</i>

619
00:24:58,541 --> 00:25:00,375
<i>This new insight says,</i>

620
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:02,916
<i>"From the five capable</i>
<i>of becoming the nations's</i>

621
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,708
<i>"new leader,</i>
<i>choose one priestess</i>

622
00:25:04,791 --> 00:25:07,166
<i>to enter into a covenant</i>
<i>with the dragon."</i>

623
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:08,708
- Wait, five?

624
00:25:08,791 --> 00:25:10,208
- That's right.

625
00:25:10,291 --> 00:25:13,250
At the moment there are only
four candidates for the honor.

626
00:25:13,333 --> 00:25:16,791
And the royal selection hasn't
even begun as of yet.

627
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,958
But today,

628
00:25:20,041 --> 00:25:22,541
History will be set in motion.

629
00:25:22,833 --> 00:25:27,000
Reinhard van Estraia
come forward. Yes, sir.

630
00:25:31,125 --> 00:25:35,583
Honored members of
the Wiseman Imperial night

631
00:25:35,666 --> 00:25:38,666
Reinhard van
Estraia would like to announce

632
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:42,333
the completion of my
mission the 5th Contender

633
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:45,875
the final candidate
mentioned in the prophecy.

634
00:25:47,291 --> 00:25:48,875
Has been located.

635
00:26:00,291 --> 00:26:05,041
The one I myself
Revere as Queen. Her name.

636
00:26:06,458 --> 00:26:08,458
He's Miss felt.

637
00:26:22,375 --> 00:26:24,916
Thank you for gracing
us with your presence mess felt.

638
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:29,583
It's wonderful to see you.
Hi Reinhard.

639
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,875
You surprised me
what could have brought on

640
00:26:42,958 --> 00:26:44,750
such aggressive behavior?

641
00:26:45,583 --> 00:26:47,041
My kicking ask me.

642
00:26:47,375 --> 00:26:49,500
That happen because I've
had about all I can take of

643
00:26:49,583 --> 00:26:53,000
your surprises do the dress
and shoes not suit your tastes.

644
00:26:53,083 --> 00:26:54,708
They both look lovely on you.

645
00:26:54,791 --> 00:26:57,416
Gimme a Break I'm not
talking about what I'm wearing.

646
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:00,375
Wait a second.
That's the girl from I guess

647
00:27:00,458 --> 00:27:03,000
it's not that easy to
change somebody at their Roots

648
00:27:03,083 --> 00:27:05,333
glad to see it's not just me.

649
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:08,541
Oh, no. What in the world
are you doing out here?

650
00:27:08,625 --> 00:27:11,833
Hey there. It's been a while
hasn't it? If you believe.

651
00:27:15,125 --> 00:27:18,041
That then why did you kick
me Miss felt if you finish

652
00:27:18,125 --> 00:27:22,083
rekindling old friendships I ask
that you please step over here.

653
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:28,208
You want me to do anyway,
if you were asking me I'd say to

654
00:27:28,291 --> 00:27:31,833
act more like
a lady but this comes first.

655
00:27:39,083 --> 00:27:42,208
As you can see
the Dragon Gem has recognized

656
00:27:42,291 --> 00:27:45,833
Miss felt as a priestess now
that her participation has been

657
00:27:45,916 --> 00:27:48,333
approved by the powers
that be I believe it's time

658
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:51,333
to begin the Royal
selection process in earnest.

659
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,666
Even if the dragons
don't has recognized her don't

660
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:01,083
you think her selection
is a bit problematic.

661
00:28:01,166 --> 00:28:04,041
So we the Imperial Knights
made a mistake.

662
00:28:06,375 --> 00:28:09,791
Is it just me or is
it getting dicey in here?

663
00:28:09,875 --> 00:28:14,708
Uh-huh doesn't bother me though.
No big deal.

664
00:28:14,791 --> 00:28:17,791
And because no matter
what happens I've already.

665
00:28:19,333 --> 00:28:22,541
Don lady
I feel the same way you do

666
00:28:22,625 --> 00:28:26,000
my sword already
belongs to miss anesthesia.

667
00:28:28,291 --> 00:28:30,625
Well, my feelings
for Amelia won't come in

668
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:33,291
second to
anybody else's look at her.

669
00:28:33,375 --> 00:28:35,875
She doesn't have
the Healing Treasures becoming.

670
00:28:38,833 --> 00:28:39,958
Silent.

671
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:45,708
Knight Reinhard Would You Begin
by explaining to us?

672
00:28:45,791 --> 00:28:49,250
Just what steps you took
that led to her discovery?

673
00:28:51,041 --> 00:28:53,666
Of course. I took
custody of Miss felt about

674
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:56,083
one month ago
while I was in the slums

675
00:28:56,458 --> 00:28:59,208
you mean she's
a gutter rat from the slums.

676
00:29:00,875 --> 00:29:03,458
Sorry for being a gutter rat
you were the one who dragged me

677
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:06,083
here against my will
all of this long-winded

678
00:29:06,166 --> 00:29:08,791
and pointless blather
could not be more tedious.

679
00:29:08,875 --> 00:29:11,375
But then again
I suppose it's quite possible.

680
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:14,000
You were living that way because
you could only manage tedious

681
00:29:14,083 --> 00:29:18,000
conversation mind then if
you want to fight you got one.

682
00:29:18,083 --> 00:29:22,333
What insolence who do you think
I am you little urchin princess?

683
00:29:22,416 --> 00:29:23,958
That's not her.

684
00:29:25,791 --> 00:29:28,166
A thousand
pardons Miss Priscilla.

685
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:29,750
What are you thinking?

686
00:29:31,666 --> 00:29:33,958
Helm down, would
you I was only trying to teach

687
00:29:34,041 --> 00:29:38,000
that undisciplined little bitch
her place you're not apologizing

688
00:29:38,083 --> 00:29:41,416
for that you're kidding
right but out of curiosity,

689
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:44,208
would you also
apologize for being born?

690
00:29:44,291 --> 00:29:46,041
You silver-haired half-elf.

691
00:29:46,125 --> 00:29:49,916
I've told you I'm not
connected to the which at all.

692
00:29:50,541 --> 00:29:52,291
Princess.
Could you drop it now?

693
00:29:52,375 --> 00:29:53,875
I'll be the one
suffering if you make too

694
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,125
many enemies, seriously.

695
00:29:57,208 --> 00:29:59,916
Well then are
you all quite finished

696
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,375
will the Royal selection
candidates?

697
00:30:01,458 --> 00:30:03,791
Please come for that this time.

698
00:30:04,041 --> 00:30:07,791
Miss Priscilla Boreal
and her attendant owl.

699
00:30:07,875 --> 00:30:10,041
The selection
process is pointless.

700
00:30:10,125 --> 00:30:12,958
I'm the only one
who suited to rule this nation.

701
00:30:13,041 --> 00:30:14,791
All you people
need to do is just grovel

702
00:30:14,875 --> 00:30:17,333
before my feet and serve.
Give me.

703
00:30:17,416 --> 00:30:20,041
The head of the Karsten
family his crew Shake

704
00:30:20,125 --> 00:30:24,166
our state and her attendant
the night Felix Argyle.

705
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:28,125
Should I become the new ruler?
I vow the dragon will forget.

706
00:30:28,208 --> 00:30:30,916
It's demanded
Covenant the dragons Empire of

707
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,041
Lugunica
belongs not to that beast.

708
00:30:33,125 --> 00:30:34,666
But to its people.

709
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:38,083
Miss Anastasia
who she of the ocean company

710
00:30:38,166 --> 00:30:41,541
and her attendants
the night Julius Eucleas.

711
00:30:42,333 --> 00:30:45,166
I'm a greedy little now,
so I want everything

712
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:47,833
no amount of commercials.
Have to satisfy me.

713
00:30:47,916 --> 00:30:51,333
I want to have
my very own Nation.

714
00:30:51,666 --> 00:30:54,208
Miss Amelia
and the man whose endorsing her

715
00:30:54,291 --> 00:30:57,416
Hargrave Roswaal L. Mathers.

716
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:01,375
I have only one wish
equality for everyone.

717
00:31:01,458 --> 00:31:05,500
I desire to create a nation
where all citizens are equal.

718
00:31:06,416 --> 00:31:09,208
Stew after the very
formal and official sounding

719
00:31:09,291 --> 00:31:11,208
introduction of all
those nights as attendance.

720
00:31:11,291 --> 00:31:15,041
I must admit that I feel
terribly out of place here.

721
00:31:15,416 --> 00:31:17,250
Finally.
Mrs. Felt on her.

722
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:19,958
Didn't the night
Reinhard van Astraia,

723
00:31:20,041 --> 00:31:22,291
hang on
don't get the wrong idea.

724
00:31:22,375 --> 00:31:24,541
I never said I wanted
to be the next ruler of this

725
00:31:24,625 --> 00:31:28,958
stupid country to be in
a Royal selection Miss felt.

726
00:31:29,041 --> 00:31:32,041
Do you actually wish to
withdraw from the selection?

727
00:31:32,833 --> 00:31:35,958
What a joke, I've overlooked
this because the situation

728
00:31:36,041 --> 00:31:38,958
was urgent but to drag
it out this long as senseless.

729
00:31:39,041 --> 00:31:41,583
He has a point
the Astraia family offers

730
00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:43,958
a gutter rat
to rule us while

731
00:31:44,041 --> 00:31:47,125
Margrave Mathers endorses
a half devil utter foolishness.

732
00:31:47,208 --> 00:31:48,458
No, let's mind our manners.

733
00:31:48,541 --> 00:31:50,333
It's not nice to
call a half L something.

734
00:31:50,416 --> 00:31:53,083
So cruel that silver hair cut.

735
00:31:53,166 --> 00:31:55,125
Not just the appearance
of the witch of Envy

736
00:31:55,208 --> 00:31:57,541
as it has been
described for many generations.

737
00:31:57,625 --> 00:31:59,250
Now, why
do not realize that even

738
00:31:59,333 --> 00:32:01,666
allowing her in
the throne room is Dreadful.

739
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:03,666
Filthy woman.

740
00:32:04,625 --> 00:32:07,583
That's enough of your crap.

741
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,500
Subaru. It's
all right. Stop this.

742
00:32:15,583 --> 00:32:17,166
No, I can't do that.

743
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:21,583
You people should be ashamed
of yourself. Apologize to her.

744
00:32:24,041 --> 00:32:26,000
Allow me to
formally introduce myself

745
00:32:26,083 --> 00:32:28,208
to the honored Council
of Elders.

746
00:32:28,291 --> 00:32:30,166
My name is Amelia.

747
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:33,833
I'm accompanied by puck
a great spirit who controls fire

748
00:32:33,916 --> 00:32:35,875
and I'm
a silver-haired half-elf.

749
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:42,458
I understand that my
half-elf lineage and other

750
00:32:42,541 --> 00:32:45,791
similarities to the infamous
which subject me to Prejudice.

751
00:32:45,875 --> 00:32:49,041
However,
I adamantly refused to let all

752
00:32:49,125 --> 00:32:52,041
my potential be plucked
out Simply for that reason.

753
00:32:52,125 --> 00:32:53,916
I will not falter.

754
00:32:54,916 --> 00:32:56,750
Amelia.

755
00:32:57,125 --> 00:33:00,208
By the way,
what exactly is the position

756
00:33:00,291 --> 00:33:02,125
of the young man speaking out?

757
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:06,500
What's that? Oh,
It's okay Amelia.

758
00:33:06,583 --> 00:33:09,666
I've made up
my mind to your mind to do.

759
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:11,875
What hold on a minute Subaru.

760
00:33:11,958 --> 00:33:14,458
What do you think
you're doing stop?

761
00:33:16,125 --> 00:33:19,041
It's nice to meet you members
of the Council of Elders.

762
00:33:19,125 --> 00:33:21,333
My name is Subaru not ski.

763
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:25,833
Man serving in Roswaal's mansion
and I serve as this candidates.

764
00:33:25,916 --> 00:33:28,875
I mean this Amelia's best night.

765
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,166
What's that a knight? Is he.

766
00:33:35,625 --> 00:33:38,708
He continues to show us how
little he knows of our world.

767
00:33:38,791 --> 00:33:40,916
Please forgive
this Interruption Council

768
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,083
my apologies, but there is
something I feel I must ask him.

769
00:33:45,166 --> 00:33:46,416
What exactly are you saying?

770
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:49,875
When you Proclaim yourself to be
miss Emily as night.

771
00:33:50,375 --> 00:33:52,500
And what's that supposed to mean

772
00:33:53,083 --> 00:33:57,000
you just declared before
everyone that you're a night

773
00:33:57,083 --> 00:33:59,875
and you did
so she audacious Lee and

774
00:33:59,958 --> 00:34:03,083
without Reserve before
the nights of Lugunica.

775
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:08,125
That was a pretty
well coordinated move.

776
00:34:08,208 --> 00:34:09,375
So did you guys practice
that just

777
00:34:09,458 --> 00:34:10,750
for this meeting or what?

778
00:34:10,833 --> 00:34:13,916
Of course we did to make
known the Dignity of our Empire.

779
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,125
We are highly conscious
every day of who we are

780
00:34:17,208 --> 00:34:21,000
tell me do you feel you have
the resolve to match that?

781
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,416
I want to meet
Miss Amelia the next ruler.

782
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:28,625
No, I will do it and
you believe you have the resolve

783
00:34:28,708 --> 00:34:31,583
and strength to do that,
which you boldly claim.

784
00:34:31,666 --> 00:34:34,000
I may not have
anything as Grand as resolved

785
00:34:34,083 --> 00:34:36,000
and I'm well aware
that I'm lacking strength.

786
00:34:36,083 --> 00:34:39,541
Either way. Amelia will
be the ruler of this land.

787
00:34:39,625 --> 00:34:43,500
I'm going to make her wish
come true. Do you not feel that?

788
00:34:43,583 --> 00:34:47,041
Your answer is far too
arrogant you spoke of weakness.

789
00:34:47,125 --> 00:34:49,333
That's something to
be ashamed of it's not

790
00:34:49,416 --> 00:34:51,625
something
for you to take pride in.

791
00:34:51,708 --> 00:34:53,833
Have you worked enough
to earn the right to stand

792
00:34:53,916 --> 00:34:56,166
there as
a champion have you performed?

793
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:57,750
Formed enough service to shame

794
00:34:57,833 --> 00:35:01,458
us the Imperial Knights
answer me.

795
00:35:02,125 --> 00:35:05,208
Whatever. I'm still
going to make Amelia the ruler.

796
00:35:05,291 --> 00:35:08,958
I don't understand.
After being so denied.

797
00:35:09,041 --> 00:35:12,291
Why do you continue to
stand there? And two fires.

798
00:35:17,583 --> 00:35:20,791
It's simple
it's because she's special.

799
00:35:22,625 --> 00:35:25,791
I recognize and accept
your reason for standing.

800
00:35:25,875 --> 00:35:28,625
However, I cannot
stand idly by and acknowledge

801
00:35:28,708 --> 00:35:31,166
your claim as a night
when I know it's not true.

802
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:32,708
What do you mean?

803
00:35:33,916 --> 00:35:37,208
Anyone inspiring such
an expression on the face

804
00:35:37,291 --> 00:35:41,041
of one they wish to
stand beside is not a knight.

805
00:35:45,333 --> 00:35:47,791
He's being
a knight that big a deal.

806
00:35:48,583 --> 00:35:50,333
You just happen to
be born into the chop.

807
00:35:50,416 --> 00:35:51,500
It's the luck of the draw.

808
00:35:51,583 --> 00:35:52,833
Don't use
your daddy's name to act

809
00:35:52,916 --> 00:35:55,125
like a big
shot about do not ski,

810
00:35:55,208 --> 00:35:56,791
that is not a good one.

811
00:36:04,375 --> 00:36:07,416
Quiet Subaru.
That's enough.

812
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:12,208
I am deeply sorry to
waste the council's time.

813
00:36:12,291 --> 00:36:14,166
I'll make him stand down.

814
00:36:16,333 --> 00:36:20,625
Miss Amelia if that young
man has done nothing else.

815
00:36:20,708 --> 00:36:24,208
He has shown us all that you are
not one to be feared.

816
00:36:24,583 --> 00:36:26,875
You have a fine attendant.

817
00:36:26,958 --> 00:36:32,791
Thank you. However,
Subaru is not my attendant.

818
00:36:35,291 --> 00:36:39,208
Mr. Subaru not ski,
please leave the room.

819
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:48,083
Now that orders
return to let us discuss how

820
00:36:48,166 --> 00:36:50,708
the Royals
selection will proceed.

821
00:36:51,833 --> 00:36:53,375
What's going on.

822
00:37:10,625 --> 00:37:12,750
I don't know who you are,
but for stealing into

823
00:37:12,833 --> 00:37:15,458
the castle,
you must be executing.

824
00:37:17,125 --> 00:37:19,458
Unfortunately, I cannot comply.

825
00:37:19,541 --> 00:37:22,375
Let me remind you that you are
publicly declared to have no

826
00:37:22,458 --> 00:37:25,625
intention of participating
in the Royal selection

827
00:37:25,708 --> 00:37:29,583
there by I am not
obligated to obey your orders.

828
00:37:43,041 --> 00:37:45,000
I'll tell your stupid selection.

829
00:37:45,083 --> 00:37:48,291
You just want me to try
to be the next ruler, don't you.

830
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:53,833
On a sec? What are you saying
felt that old man is my family.

831
00:37:53,916 --> 00:37:58,500
So let him go right now
treat him with care very well.

832
00:37:58,583 --> 00:38:00,625
Really.
Sorry felt.

833
00:38:00,708 --> 00:38:04,666
I just wanted to
we'll talk later on. Okay,

834
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,083
Pretty sneaky Reinhard.

835
00:38:10,166 --> 00:38:12,500
So this was all part
of your plan to I take it.

836
00:38:12,583 --> 00:38:17,208
No certainly not miss. This was
something Guided by Fate itself.

837
00:38:17,291 --> 00:38:21,208
This is me. You're
some kind of slave to fate.

838
00:38:21,583 --> 00:38:26,625
Not at all. Tall from
now on I am your night.

839
00:38:26,708 --> 00:38:30,458
Okay fine,
then I'll work you to death.

840
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:35,208
No Miss felt
and her night Reinhard.

841
00:38:35,291 --> 00:38:37,375
May we conclude
that you both intend to

842
00:38:37,458 --> 00:38:39,958
participate
in the Royal selection?

843
00:38:40,333 --> 00:38:42,416
Sure, you can
Count Me In let me just say

844
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,500
one thing to you clowns.

845
00:38:45,125 --> 00:38:50,125
I hate the nobility.
And I hate night. right.

846
00:38:52,125 --> 00:38:55,000
I hate every last
thing about this damn place.

847
00:38:55,083 --> 00:38:59,208
So I'm planning to tear
it all down to the ground.

848
00:38:59,291 --> 00:39:01,250
How about that?

849
00:39:02,333 --> 00:39:04,833
Wait, what are you saying?

850
00:39:05,416 --> 00:39:09,125
If I become the next roller?
I'll destroy everything.

851
00:39:09,208 --> 00:39:10,833
Do you think I'm kidding?

852
00:39:10,916 --> 00:39:13,000
I'll take down every
single one of you and bring

853
00:39:13,083 --> 00:39:15,416
a little fresh
air into this country.

854
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:19,041
Your mistress is quite
the intense lady Reinhard Miss

855
00:39:19,125 --> 00:39:22,000
felt speaks
with conviction soon her.

856
00:39:22,083 --> 00:39:24,166
I will be heard by all.

857
00:39:25,041 --> 00:39:30,375
I see. In any case all
the candidates are here at last.

858
00:39:31,583 --> 00:39:35,291
The Royal
selection will now begin.

859
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,583
The time has come
the Royal selection has

860
00:39:39,666 --> 00:39:44,250
finally begun Subaru Hey
you Miss Amelia is nighttime.

861
00:39:44,333 --> 00:39:46,208
Yeah, let's
both do our best for this.

862
00:39:46,291 --> 00:39:49,500
Okay, forgive
me for interrupting.

863
00:39:50,708 --> 00:39:52,958
What the hell
are you doing here?

864
00:39:53,041 --> 00:39:56,125
I wish you wouldn't
make such an unpleasant face.

865
00:39:56,208 --> 00:39:58,708
I didn't expect
you to warmly welcome me,

866
00:39:58,791 --> 00:40:01,208
but if you take
that That attitude then if

867
00:40:01,291 --> 00:40:04,000
I take that attitude,
then what the propriety of

868
00:40:04,083 --> 00:40:06,208
those in your company
will come into question.

869
00:40:06,291 --> 00:40:08,916
I would suggest
that you be careful.

870
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:13,041
Now that you ask me
why I'm here, correct.

871
00:40:13,125 --> 00:40:14,958
I came to see you. Of course.

872
00:40:15,041 --> 00:40:17,166
I'd like you to
come with me for a bit.

873
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:20,833
There's something rather
important we need to discuss.

874
00:40:25,291 --> 00:40:29,750
Julius you shouldn't do this.
It's not like you he insulted.

875
00:40:29,833 --> 00:40:31,583
Knights directly in
front of the candidates

876
00:40:31,666 --> 00:40:33,250
to be our future ruler.

877
00:40:33,333 --> 00:40:35,041
He also made
light of the chivalry.

878
00:40:35,125 --> 00:40:37,541
We dutifully
practice I admit he said

879
00:40:37,625 --> 00:40:39,125
some things
that went a bit too far,

880
00:40:39,208 --> 00:40:41,166
but to take proper
measures for such a matter.

881
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:44,000
He need only
be warned and corrected.

882
00:40:44,083 --> 00:40:48,041
Proper sorry,
but this is not only my problem.

883
00:40:48,125 --> 00:40:50,666
I administer the death
penalty to this insubordinate

884
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:53,208
man who solely
the Knighthood daughter.

885
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:56,916
Now it wouldn't
be unusual for you to be

886
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,208
slain for such insolence.

887
00:40:59,291 --> 00:41:01,791
However much to my
dismay you are missing

888
00:41:01,875 --> 00:41:03,500
me and he has attempted.

889
00:41:03,583 --> 00:41:06,791
Therefore. We will
fight using wooden swords.

890
00:41:07,958 --> 00:41:10,791
Right Shall We Begin you got it,

891
00:41:10,875 --> 00:41:13,291
but I warn
you I won't hold back.

892
00:41:23,208 --> 00:41:24,791
As expected it appears.

893
00:41:24,875 --> 00:41:29,291
You truly have no Pride what
a simple and vulgar way to live.

894
00:41:35,458 --> 00:41:39,666
Withholding the night Julius
and Mr. Subaru not skier having

895
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:42,500
a mock battle with wooden
swords in the training ring.

896
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,291
There's just one thing.

897
00:41:47,375 --> 00:41:49,916
I want to know which one
of them issued the challenge.

898
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,958
Do you have any idea I'm
told it was the night Julius.

899
00:41:54,041 --> 00:41:56,541
Mr. Subaru not ski
accepted the challenge

900
00:41:56,625 --> 00:41:58,541
leading to this
fight kind of figured.

901
00:41:58,625 --> 00:42:01,208
Well, I'm against
stopping them then hold on

902
00:42:01,291 --> 00:42:03,791
your night and my
um friend are fighting

903
00:42:03,875 --> 00:42:06,500
aren't you the least bit
worried about what might happen

904
00:42:06,583 --> 00:42:09,750
worried seriously about
what the Julie is takes things

905
00:42:09,833 --> 00:42:12,583
too far, and I'll have to pay
for your boys medical treatment

906
00:42:12,666 --> 00:42:15,125
if we're questioning the Dilemma
of their mock battle.

907
00:42:15,208 --> 00:42:17,750
Well, I can't agree with
stopping it before they finish

908
00:42:17,833 --> 00:42:19,458
either if they're just
duking it out you could have

909
00:42:19,541 --> 00:42:22,375
waited until it ended
and simply told us who won.

910
00:42:22,458 --> 00:42:25,875
Yes, ma'am.
But the fight was well,

911
00:42:25,958 --> 00:42:29,916
it was just so
one-sided that I never stop it.

912
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:32,833
We should go to after all.

913
00:42:32,916 --> 00:42:34,583
You like
watching weak creatures being

914
00:42:34,666 --> 00:42:36,125
tormented
by a vicious Beast don't

915
00:42:36,208 --> 00:42:40,333
you misjudge me with your own
unfounded imaginings Al.

916
00:42:40,708 --> 00:42:42,916
Yes, you know I do.

917
00:42:44,708 --> 00:42:47,166
Do why don't you stop
this self-torturing admit

918
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:48,916
that you've reached her limit.

919
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,291
I'm sure you've now
realized what painful extent

920
00:42:52,375 --> 00:42:55,958
just nights that you insulted
and made light of really are.

921
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:04,208
I believe continuing
would endanger your life.

922
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:12,250
I'm gonna break. The nose
of yours. I'll Crush you.

923
00:43:29,041 --> 00:43:31,625
This was the ace up your sleeve.

924
00:43:31,875 --> 00:43:35,666
Sure skill level is far
too poultry such low level

925
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:39,791
magic will only work on
unintelligent Beasts, boy.

926
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,916
You aren't worthy
to stand at her side.

927
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:50,833
You are irredeemably powerless.

928
00:44:06,833 --> 00:44:08,666
So I didn't die then.

929
00:44:11,916 --> 00:44:15,916
Subaru that talk with
the Royal candidates Subaru.

930
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,500
I see let's head straight back.

931
00:44:18,583 --> 00:44:22,750
Then. We need to work out
a plan for the selection. Sorry.

932
00:44:23,458 --> 00:44:28,708
Let's talk. Okay. I have
some things I want to ask you.

933
00:44:29,291 --> 00:44:34,000
Many things actually.
Yeah, I guess you do.

934
00:44:34,458 --> 00:44:38,208
Tell me. Why did you end
up? Well fighting with Julius.

935
00:44:38,291 --> 00:44:41,416
I mean there must have
been a reason right knowing you.

936
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:42,708
I'm sure it was very important.

937
00:44:42,791 --> 00:44:45,375
Wanted to get him
back for what he said.

938
00:44:46,666 --> 00:44:48,416
I was being stubborn.

939
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:52,333
He said I was pathetic
powerless and not worthy of you.

940
00:44:52,416 --> 00:44:56,250
He was trying to distance me
from you and I hated him for it.

941
00:44:56,333 --> 00:45:00,916
That's why I fought him.
Really just for that.

942
00:45:02,291 --> 00:45:04,541
It's true.
Melee.

943
00:45:05,333 --> 00:45:10,416
And I know that you don't
understand. I see.

944
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:12,375
Roswell and
I have made arrangements to

945
00:45:12,458 --> 00:45:14,708
head back
to the mansion tomorrow.

946
00:45:14,791 --> 00:45:17,083
You will remain here
in the capital to recover.

947
00:45:17,166 --> 00:45:18,583
Wait a minute.

948
00:45:18,958 --> 00:45:21,000
That was
our agreement wasn't it?

949
00:45:21,083 --> 00:45:23,083
Yeah, but hang on
Earth came to the capital.

950
00:45:23,166 --> 00:45:25,166
So Felix could
heal your exhausted gate.

951
00:45:25,250 --> 00:45:28,083
I was very clear about this. No,
wait a minute.

952
00:45:28,166 --> 00:45:29,875
How can you suddenly.

953
00:45:30,208 --> 00:45:33,750
Because.
When I'm with you?

954
00:45:33,833 --> 00:45:36,375
Do you always push yourself
to do impossible things?

955
00:45:36,458 --> 00:45:39,791
Wait? No, hold on.
That's not what I'm saying.

956
00:45:39,875 --> 00:45:43,291
I just wanted you wanted
what was let me finish.

957
00:45:43,375 --> 00:45:46,083
I just wanted to try and
do something important for you.

958
00:45:46,166 --> 00:45:49,166
Is that right for me?

959
00:45:51,583 --> 00:45:57,875
It was for you, wasn't it?
No it was for you. I swear.

960
00:46:01,208 --> 00:46:04,291
You said that to me
so many times stop telling

961
00:46:04,375 --> 00:46:07,208
lies about how
everything is for my sake.

962
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:11,666
So coming to the castle
fighting Julius and using magic.

963
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:14,583
Are you trying to
say that was all for me

964
00:46:14,666 --> 00:46:17,541
why I never
ask you to do any of that.

965
00:46:17,916 --> 00:46:21,833
Now think back. Do you remember
what I asked you to do?

966
00:46:21,916 --> 00:46:24,500
Really?
I let me remind you.

967
00:46:24,583 --> 00:46:27,500
I asked you to stay
behind to the lodging with REM.

968
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:31,125
I asked you specifically not to
use magic because using anymore.

969
00:46:31,208 --> 00:46:34,000
Would endanger human I'm sorry.
I didn't do as you asked.

970
00:46:34,083 --> 00:46:35,750
It was a mistake,
but you're wrong about

971
00:46:35,833 --> 00:46:37,250
my reasons you're wrong.

972
00:46:37,333 --> 00:46:40,666
Honestly, it wasn't for myself.
Please believe me.

973
00:46:42,333 --> 00:46:48,625
I say that but you won't
believe me. Will you I want to.

974
00:46:48,916 --> 00:46:53,166
I want to believe
you Subaru very much.

975
00:46:53,541 --> 00:46:56,125
With every choice
you make you show me.

976
00:46:56,208 --> 00:46:58,166
I have no reason to.

977
00:47:00,666 --> 00:47:03,083
You made a promise to me, but

978
00:47:03,166 --> 00:47:06,458
you threw it away just like
that and came all the way here.

979
00:47:06,541 --> 00:47:08,625
Despite what you swore to me.

980
00:47:08,708 --> 00:47:11,541
You won't keep
your soul about to me your word

981
00:47:11,625 --> 00:47:13,500
and yet
you ask me to believe you.

982
00:47:13,583 --> 00:47:17,000
I can't do that. I can't.

983
00:47:24,625 --> 00:47:26,416
I still don't understand.

984
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:29,500
Why do you keep
trying to help me like this.

985
00:47:29,875 --> 00:47:32,875
Because of the many
times that you helped me.

986
00:47:33,166 --> 00:47:38,458
Wait. I helped you. Yes,
that's right.

987
00:47:39,333 --> 00:47:41,250
You don't even realize
how the things you've done

988
00:47:41,333 --> 00:47:44,375
for me if
saved me over and over.

989
00:47:46,916 --> 00:47:48,083
No, sir.

990
00:47:48,166 --> 00:47:51,166
I don't
and I don't expect you to

991
00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:54,375
but it's the truth
you seek me time and time again.

992
00:47:54,458 --> 00:47:56,250
So every last thing
I've done is been to repay

993
00:47:56,333 --> 00:47:59,041
you for your kindness.
I love you.

994
00:48:00,708 --> 00:48:04,291
Maybe you don't I totally
get that but please listen to me

995
00:48:04,375 --> 00:48:06,208
cuz it's the absolute truth.

996
00:48:06,291 --> 00:48:08,375
It was you when
I first came to this world.

997
00:48:08,458 --> 00:48:10,625
You were the one who saved me.

998
00:48:15,958 --> 00:48:19,375
It appears that once again,
you won't tell me anything.

999
00:48:19,750 --> 00:48:22,875
Why won't you understand
what I'm going through?

1000
00:48:22,958 --> 00:48:25,958
I thought if anyone
would be able to understand

1001
00:48:26,041 --> 00:48:29,750
everything
that's happening to me you.

1002
00:48:30,125 --> 00:48:33,750
The version of me that lives
within you must be amazing.

1003
00:48:34,125 --> 00:48:37,208
She understands
all of your thoughts.

1004
00:48:37,291 --> 00:48:40,041
Even if you don't
explain them to her.

1005
00:48:40,125 --> 00:48:43,166
She can feel all your pain
and all of your sadness

1006
00:48:43,250 --> 00:48:46,166
as well as
your anger is her very young.

1007
00:48:48,083 --> 00:48:51,666
I can't understand.
If you don't tell me Subaru.

1008
00:48:54,625 --> 00:49:00,125
Everything.
Everything has been thrown.

1009
00:49:00,708 --> 00:49:04,166
Everything that we both face
it all worked out next to me.

1010
00:49:04,250 --> 00:49:06,250
Didn't it? When
your Insignia was stolen?

1011
00:49:06,333 --> 00:49:09,000
I saved you from an insane
killer at the Lewis house.

1012
00:49:09,083 --> 00:49:11,833
I risk my life for
you all because you are

1013
00:49:11,916 --> 00:49:14,333
important
to me at the Mansion to

1014
00:49:14,416 --> 00:49:17,083
it works out because of
what I did without me there.

1015
00:49:17,166 --> 00:49:20,416
We have been a whole lot worse.
Oh all of it all of it,

1016
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:24,000
you are saved
because I was there for you.

1017
00:49:24,083 --> 00:49:25,916
Don't you see
you should have a greater

1018
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,500
density
than you could ever repay.

1019
00:49:30,958 --> 00:49:32,500
Yes.
You're right.

1020
00:49:33,125 --> 00:49:36,041
All of these debts
that I owe you so many

1021
00:49:36,125 --> 00:49:38,208
they piled up haven't they?

1022
00:49:39,291 --> 00:49:40,458
Yeah, that's right.

1023
00:49:40,541 --> 00:49:43,208
So do you get
it now then I'll repay

1024
00:49:43,291 --> 00:49:45,291
all of them This Moment.

1025
00:49:46,375 --> 00:49:47,875
By ending.

1026
00:49:55,791 --> 00:49:59,291
You've done
enough Subaru not ski,

1027
00:49:59,875 --> 00:50:03,625
You know I had
such high hopes for him.

1028
00:50:04,041 --> 00:50:07,750
Thought maybe you only
you wouldn't give me the special

1029
00:50:07,833 --> 00:50:12,458
treatment that surrounded
me my entire life and that maybe

1030
00:50:12,541 --> 00:50:14,375
he would look at me
in the exact same way.

1031
00:50:14,458 --> 00:50:19,500
You look at everyone else.
I'm sorry, I can't do that.

1032
00:50:20,708 --> 00:50:23,083
Absolutely no way
I can look at you the same way

1033
00:50:23,166 --> 00:50:26,625
I look at other people.
It's impossible.
