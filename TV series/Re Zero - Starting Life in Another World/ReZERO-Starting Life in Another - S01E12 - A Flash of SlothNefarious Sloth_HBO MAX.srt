- [energy warbles]

169
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,708
You must be exhausted, Lia.

170
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:35,750
You should lie down
and rest for a bit.

171
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:38,500
- Mm-mmm.

172
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:41,500
I don't think that I'll
be able to fall asleep.

173
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:43,208
Aren't you
getting tired, though?

174
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:45,166
- No way. I'm fine.

175
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,583
The forest barrier
is all fixed up, too.

176
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:48,708
You don't have
to worry about anything.

[brush rustling]

00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:06,875
- This feels a little bit
like the time

181
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:11,833
I found a big, ugly insect
in the corner of a quiet room.

182
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:13,375
So you guys are drawn
to the smell, huh?

183
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:17,166
Looks like I'm
perfect cockroach bait.

184
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,125
Man, I must reek.

185
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:20,791
Thank you for meeting me.

186
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,791
I know you
just got here and all,

187
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:25,875
but the business
that I need to discuss,

188
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:28,916
it's really more a matter for
me
and your boss, not you guys,

189
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,208
so don't get in my way.

190

[sighs]

191
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:37,166
If they'd hung around and
waited
for just a little bit longer,

192
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,541
I could have told them
to pack up and go home.

193
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:40,833
Guess we'll do it
the hard way.

[men's chorus chanting]

- I've been waiting
ever so patiently for you,

197
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:52,583
believer in love.

198
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:54,916
I am a Sin Archbishop
of the Witch's cult

199
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,125

00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:02,291
I welcome you,

203
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:06,166
beloved child blessed with love.
[laughs]

204
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,666
Wonderful! [laughs]

205
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,208
Wonderful!

[chorus vocalizing]

00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:13,583
- Hey.

208
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:17,083
I really appreciate
the unexpected welcome,

209
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:19,291
but I gotta admit
I'm not sure I really feel

210
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:20,416
all of this love
you keep bringing up.

211
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,791
- It always begins
suddenly out of the blue.

212
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:25,000
Everyone on a certain day

213
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:27,958
comes to the realization
that they're indeed loved.

214
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:29,333
They feel it...

215
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:31,291
the love, the love, the love,
the love, the love,

216
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:33,125
the love, the love, the love...

217
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:37,291
- So what exactly
am I supposed to do now?

218
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:38,625
- Ah...

219
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:40,125
the most generous
love of the Witch.

220
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:43,541
Now tell me something, boy,

221
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,291
you wouldn't happen
to be Pride, would you?

222
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:48,916
Out of the six Sin Archbishops
in total,

223
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,958
only the seat of Pride
remains unclaimed and vacant.

224
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:54,833
A query for you.

225
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:58,750
You have received the Gospel,
have you not?

226
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:00,125
- The Gospel?

- Presentation of the Gospel.

Where is the proof of love?

[cackles] The proof!

Huh?

There doesn't seem to be
an account of you

238
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,708
anywhere in my Gospel.

Why appear here before me?

242
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:29,708
Why visit
this place in particular?!

243
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:32,125
What fortune are you here
to bestow upon me, boy?!

244

Huh?!

- Oh, wow.

246
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:36,041
So that's the Gospel.

00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:37,375
Yeah, I see. I see.

248
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:40,875
Of course.
I understand completely.

249
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:43,208
You should have just said so
in the first place.

[patting]

Ah, darn it!

My bad. I'm sorry.

- About what?

254
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,750
- My Gospel is, well...

00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:52,708
you see...

256
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:56,458
I used it as a coaster,
and it got messy...

257
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:59,250
so I threw it in the trash.

[music playing]

Behold the Unseen Hand!

- How did you...

00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:13,708
- Oh, wow. Crappy trick.

263
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,125
An Unseen Hand
isn't all that great

264
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,791
if I can see it and evade it.

265
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:17,416
- What did you say?!

266
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,916
You can see my Unseen Hand?!

267
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,375
- Okay, I'd say I'm
just about done buying time.

Suffer in darkness

275
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:43,833
for all the terrible things
you've done!

276
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:45,583
- How? How can this be?

277
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:49,333
My fingers so cruelly,
so mercilessly,

278
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:53,791
so chaotically,
so arbitrarily,

279
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:56,125
so artlessly,
so very meaninglessly...

00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:59,500
[wailing]

00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:01,958
My brain.

282
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:03,083
My brain trembles!

283
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:05,291
- Scary.

284
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:07,125
That guy's
completely out of his mind.

285

- Pretty sure all the Witch's
Cultists are like that,

286
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:10,416
scary and crazy.

287
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,291
- Yes, of course.
It all makes sense.

288
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:13,875
Yes, of course.
It all makes sense.

289
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:16,500
Yes, of course.
It all makes sense. [gasps]

290
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:17,833
Yes. Fine!

291
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:19,041
Yes. Fine! I understand.

292
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:20,166
Let's do this!

293
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,125
I'm ready to do this!

294
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,125
I'm not afraid.

295
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:26,208
The time has come
to find out which one of us

296
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:27,833
is worthy of her love!

297
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:29,375
Worthy of her love, yes!

298
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:31,166
Her love!

your screamy fun, but...

- Eh?

301
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:36,750
- I've got someone else
lined up to take you on.

302
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:40,166
- Hyah!

303
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:51,041
[thump]

304
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:53,375
SUBARU: I-It's over, right?

305
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:54,375
He's dead?

306
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:56,916
- Oh, yes, he's very much dead.

307
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,833
The most powerful healer
in the capital

308
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:00,875
personally guarantees it.

309
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:02,333
- Right. Good.

310
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:04,208
Thanks for that, Wilhelm.

311
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:06,500
I hope it wasn't
asking too much.

312
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:09,166
- Really? What do you mean?

313
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:12,250
- Isn't cutting someone down
from behind without warning

314
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,916
like the worst thing
a knight can do?

315
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,125
- Chivalry is a code of conduct
that's long dead.

316
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:20,958
You need not concern yourself
with that.

317
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:22,541
- Hmm.

318
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:25,000
It doesn't look like this weirdo

319
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:27,041
was carrying
anything useful on him.

320
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:30,250
- Wow, you two little guys
are ransacking his corpse

321
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:32,791
like it's not a big deal.
Kinda creepy.

322
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:34,916
- Look, I'm not little,
and the name's Tivey.

323
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,875
I believe
it's our right as victors

324
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:39,125
to search out
the spoils of battle.

325
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:40,375
Hmm?

326
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:42,375
What is this?

327
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:43,208
Some kind of book?

328
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:45,791
SUBARU: Well, I think
that particular book

329
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:47,833
is the one Betelgeuse
called the Gospel.

330
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:49,250
- [both gasp]
- You mean this is the Gospel?!

331
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:51,833
Oh, no! I-I touched it!

332
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:56,583
- I can't read it.

333
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:59,250
Do you know
what this says, Felix?

334
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:00,041
- [both gasp]
- No, wait!

335
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:02,125
Don't you point
that thing at me!

336
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:03,041
Why in the world
would you do something

337
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:06,291
as stupid as trying to read
the Gospel, huh?

338
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:08,375
- Is it really that dangerous?

339
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:09,875
Huh?

340
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:11,208
WILHELM:
The Gospel is the proof

341
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:13,583
that one belongs
to the Witch's Cult.

342
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:16,958
It's basically what you'd call
their sacred text.

343
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:18,208
SUBARU: Their what?

344
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:19,916
FELIX: From what
the rumors say,

345
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,541
one of these is delivered
to anybody with the potential

346
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:23,833
to join the cult,

347
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:26,583
and once a person gets it,
guess what.

348
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:29,250
They're neow a devout member
of the Witch's Cult,

349
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:30,583
just like that!

350
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:34,250
SUBARU: Man,
how shady can you get?

351
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:37,083
Well, I guess
I'll take this with me.

352
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:38,333
If I can decipher it,

353
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:41,458
maybe I can figure out what
the Witch's Cult really is.

354
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:43,458
- [gasps] Hey, hey!

355
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:45,458
Oh, listen, I know we've
killed the enemy here,

356
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:47,958
but shouldn't we
take a look around and make sure

357
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:50,166
there aren't any other ones
to make dead, too?

358
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,500
- Yeah. You know,
as adorable as you might look,

359
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:55,916
you sure say some pretty weird
and disturbing things.

360
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,916
- [laughs] I'm adorable?
You're making me blush.

361
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,666
- So the subordinates
that Betelgeuse called fingers

362
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:04,208
number ten in total, correct?
That makes things easier.

363
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:08,166
- I think one of those creeps is
pinned under this pile of rocks.

364
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,500
- Ten creeps minus one is nine!

365
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:11,333
That means nine creeps are left!

366
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:14,208
- Well, then,
shall we find the others?

367
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:15,250
- [grunts]

368
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,666
Now, this freak of nature
is actually dead, right?

369
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,000
He's not gonna come back

370
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:26,875
the second we look away,
is he? [groans]

371
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:30,250
- Fine! If you're
that worried about it,

372
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:31,083
we'll make extra sure!

373
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:32,750
- [gasps]

374
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:37,916
[overlapping chatter]

375
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,500
JULIUS: We crushed two
of the ones called fingers here.

376
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:42,416
A few of the cultists
were skilled,

377
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,625
but in the end,
they weren't a threat.

378
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:47,416
It would seem we made no errors
in driving them off.

379
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,625
- I'm glad it went well
for you guys, too.

380
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:51,083
JULIUS: Given your demeanor,

381
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:53,625
I can only assume
that your news is good as well.

382
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:56,500
- Yep. Our group
took out Betelgeuse.

383
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:59,000
- That Subaru, he's a worrywart.

384
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,000
so that's why
we blew him to bits,

385
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:03,708
blasting that creep kaboom-style
after we killed him!

386
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:04,708
- Whoa!

387
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:06,000
- Nice work.

388
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:07,541
So that just leaves
the simple task

389
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:09,166
of mopping up
the remnants then, huh?

390
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,041
- We'd better hurry
and take care of 'em

391
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:13,625
before my beautiful lady
turns into an old granny.

392
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:14,458
Hey, what's going on?

393
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:16,625
That was my best joke.

394
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:18,541
[Mimi laughs]

395
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:20,541
JULIUS: We rendezvous soon

396
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:21,875
with the dragon-drawn carriages
you arranged.

397
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:24,708
Let's eliminate
the remaining fingers

398
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:27,666
and greet our victory
over this cult together.

399
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,750
- 'Kay, Subaru,
time for the bait.

400
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:31,125
Put out that smell.

401
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:32,416
Neow breathe in.

402
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,083
- [inhales]
- And out.

403
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:36,416
- [exhales]
- And out!

404
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,291
- And out! And out!
- [gasping]

405
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:41,541
Stop that!
I gotta breathe in, too!

406
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:44,166
- [laughter]

407
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:47,250
- So I guess...

408
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:50,125
- [laughter]
- once this is all done,

409
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:52,791
we'll just go back to being
friend and foe, won't we?

410
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:56,166
- How confident of you to worry
about what's yet to come.

411
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:56,791
- Hey, give me a break.

412
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:57,833
It's going almost too well,

413
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:01,583
so maybe I let
my guard down a little.

414
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:04,250
[gasps]

415
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:06,583
Get down now, all of you!

416
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:10,083
[Authority warbles]

417
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:19,750
- What the hell?
What's going on here?

418
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:21,583
-<i> The Unseen Hand.</i>

- [all gasp]
- WILHELM: Subaru!

424
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:35,208
- Damn it! Agh!

425
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:38,625
[gasping]

426
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:45,708

427
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:48,208
My brain, it trembles.

428
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:50,583
- [gasps]

429
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:55,291
Who are you? Huh?

430
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:59,625
Who the hell are you?

431
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:01,708
Wait a second.

432
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:03,750
Are you Betelgeuse's...

433
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:04,916
- His finger?

434
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:06,166
Yes!

435
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:07,291
- [warbles]
- [Subaru groans]

436
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:09,583
[straining] Let me... go.

437
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:12,791
- I am a finger that carries out
whatever needs to be done,

438
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:14,583
one who reciprocates love.

439
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:18,666
I am a disciple, a faithful
and diligent one, to be sure,

440
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:22,208
and I will carry out the Ordeal
following love's guidance!

441

- [creaking]
- [groaning]

442
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:24,500
A copy.

443
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:27,458
A replica
of the original Betelgeuse.

444
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:29,000
If that's true,

445
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:32,666
this couldn't possibly
get any worse for us.

446
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,916
- [gagging]
- Sniff, sniff.

447
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,416
The love I smell
that wraps itself around you

448
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,875
does not compare to that
of a mere lowly follower.

449
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:43,500
It is equal to that
of a Sin Archbishop.

450
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,666
It is exceedingly displeasing,

451
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:47,500
dissatisfying, disturbing,

452
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:49,208
disagreeable, discomforting,

453
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:51,333
disproportionate, discordant!

454
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:55,791
But that is the proof
which tells me you are Pride!

455
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:58,500
- [gasps] Don't make me
keep saying it.

456
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:00,541
I'm not even close
to being Pride!

457
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:03,458
I've never even gotten a free
book as a membership perk!

458
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:06,541
- Ah! My, aren't you
a stubborn one?

459
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:10,375
Even so, soon enough,
you will quite readily receive--

460
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:11,833
Eh? The Gospel.

461
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:15,208
[gasps] My love's guidance.

462
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:15,875
The Gospel that allows me,

463
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:18,333
inexperienced though I may be,

464
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:20,208
to reciprocate love!

465
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:21,500
What happened?!

466
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:23,791
Why is not with me?! No!

467
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:26,583
Wait a moment.

468
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:27,375
Was it you?

469
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:28,916
Was it you? Was it you?
Was it you?

470
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,958
Was it you, you, you,
you, you, you, you?!

471
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:35,375
Did you steal
my copy of the Gospel?!

472
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:36,375
- Eh?

473
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:39,375
- What is--
- A spirit!

Are you two slothful?!

486
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:12,875
- [grunts]
- [yelps]

487
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:16,708
My life is spilling out.

488
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:19,666
My blood is running dry.

489
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:22,625
[gasps] My diligent
and constant pulse,

490
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:24,833
my precious life support,

491
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:27,833
it's stopping, disappearing.

492
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:30,541
[gasps] Oh, my brain...

493
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:31,875
trembles!

494
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:35,291
[wind blowing]

495
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:36,416
- From what I can gather,

496
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,416
the first Sloth we defeated
was a double,

497
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,791
and the one dead on the ground
is the real one?

498
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:42,291
JULIUS: No.

499
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:43,916
I believe this may not
even be a matter

500
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,250
of knowing which of them
is the real one.

501
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:47,958
- You don't mean
the Sin Archbishop of Sloth

502
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:51,333
might actually
be more than one person?

503
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:54,000
- Possibly,
or all hundred followers,

504
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:55,416
including the fingers,

505
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,916
are the Sin Archbishop of Sloth.

506
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:00,583
- I dragged you into this.

507
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:02,041
It's all my fault.

508
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:05,625
- [steeds growling]
- [carriage jostling]

509
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:08,125
[wind blowing]

510
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:11,750
- [gasps]

511
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:14,666
If I'd realized it sooner,

512
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,541
I could have avoided this.
Damn it.

513
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:19,500
[sighs] I knew
what kind of power it was,

514
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:21,625
so I-I just...

515
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:24,833
- Subaru, sir.
- [gasps]

516
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:27,416
- I'm sure many thoughts

517
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,333
are going through
your mind right now,

518
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:32,250
and I am certain
none of them are superficial,

519
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:35,541
but while it may be
somewhat
inelegant of me to say so,

520
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:37,625
I feel rather compelled

521
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:40,583
to speak from my heart
and my mind on this.

522
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:41,791
- [gasps]

523
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:44,916
- Keep fighting!
- [gasps]

524
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,125
- Even if you have regrets,

525
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:49,708
even if you're
completely remorseful,

526
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:50,833
you must fight on.

527
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:53,250
If you've committed,

528
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:55,875
if you've made the decision
to stand against them,

529
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:58,041
struggle and fight
with all you have.

530
00:21:58,125 --> 00:21:59,833
- [gasps]
- Don't give up for one second,

531
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:03,375
one moment, or one instant.

532
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:06,541
Cling greedily to the victory
you have within your sight.

533
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:08,000
If you can still stand,

534
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:10,208
if your fingers can still move,

535
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:13,291
if all your teeth
haven't yet broken...

536
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:17,041
then stand tall
to the bitter end.

537
00:22:21,125 --> 00:22:23,083
You mustn't ever stop.

538
00:22:25,833 --> 00:22:28,541
- Are you telling me
to get stronger?

539
00:22:29,583 --> 00:22:31,750
- Hardly.

540
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:35,416
I'm telling you to be strong.

541
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:41,083
Are you ready?

542
00:22:41,166 --> 00:22:43,125
- Yeah.

543
00:22:43,208 --> 00:22:44,583
Let's go.

544
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:48,833
Lend me your wisdom
and your strength!

545
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:53,666
We're gonna start
evacuating
the mansion and village.

546
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:55,500
Don't waste a single second!

547
00:22:57,916 --> 00:22:59,875
As of right now,

548
00:22:59,958 --> 00:23:01,583
the Witch's Cult
hasn't had enough time

549
00:23:01,666 --> 00:23:03,750
to notice
that we've gotten away,

550
00:23:03,833 --> 00:23:06,541
which means we can get Emilia
and the rest in carriages

551
00:23:06,625 --> 00:23:09,083
and get them to safety
in plain sight.

552
00:23:09,166 --> 00:23:11,416
- With Miss Emilia and
the others out of harm's way,

553
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,416
we won't have to worry
about them anymore,

554
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:15,458
so we can focus
on conquering the Witch's Cult.

555
00:23:15,541 --> 00:23:17,125
Going into battle isn't easy

556
00:23:17,208 --> 00:23:18,958
when you know
you have a weak point.

557
00:23:19,041 --> 00:23:20,541
- You're making my ears hurt,

558
00:23:20,625 --> 00:23:21,583
but, yeah, that's exactly right.

559
00:23:22,916 --> 00:23:24,916
- And while I'm at it,

560
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,125
there's one more thing
I want to say to you.

561
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:28,250
Subaru, you should
really settle things

562
00:23:28,333 --> 00:23:31,625
and make up with Julius soon.
Understand?

563
00:23:31,708 --> 00:23:33,750
- Soon?
What are you talking about?

564
00:23:33,833 --> 00:23:36,625
We already reconciled
after our fight. Didn't you see?

565
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:38,791
- But that was
just the first step.

566
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:41,000
Subconsciously
you're still harboring

567
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:42,333
- some resentment towards him.
- [grumbles]

568
00:23:42,416 --> 00:23:45,791
- You should kneow
you can rely on Julius.

569
00:23:45,875 --> 00:23:46,958
Though I admit
he's a bit unapproachable

570
00:23:47,041 --> 00:23:49,458
and incomprehensible.

571
00:23:53,041 --> 00:23:54,291
Go on. Hurry up.

572
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:54,708
- Uh...

573
00:23:54,791 --> 00:23:55,791
[groans]

574
00:23:55,875 --> 00:23:57,625
Okay, fine!

575
00:24:02,791 --> 00:24:04,833
So, uh...

576
00:24:04,916 --> 00:24:06,083
hey, listen.

577
00:24:06,166 --> 00:24:08,166
There's something that--

578
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:09,958
something that I wanted
to say to you,

579
00:24:10,041 --> 00:24:12,750
but it's hard for...

580
00:24:14,666 --> 00:24:16,000
[gasps]

581
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:18,833
Huh?

582
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:20,958
[music playing]

583
00:24:32,875 --> 00:24:34,875
[music playing]

584
00:24:34,958 --> 00:24:35,916
- [shudders]

585
00:24:36,666 --> 00:24:38,875
What in the hell's
going on here?

586
00:24:38,958 --> 00:24:40,875
Did the Witch's Cult do this?

587
00:24:40,958 --> 00:24:42,583
Hey, anyone!

588
00:24:42,666 --> 00:24:44,208
Is anyone there?!

589
00:24:44,291 --> 00:24:46,666
Hey, answer me!

590
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:47,750
[soft buzzing]

591
00:24:47,833 --> 00:24:49,708
[winces]

592
00:24:49,791 --> 00:24:52,875
Wh-What is that intense smell?

593
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:53,666
[buzzing continues]

594
00:24:54,791 --> 00:24:56,500
[gasps]

Patrasche.

[gagging]

599
00:25:12,291 --> 00:25:13,416
Hang on a second.

600
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:17,541
A flower like this
couldn't actually exist.

601
00:25:17,625 --> 00:25:20,666
And Patrasche
wouldn't just let me die.

602
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:24,125
Which means that this
is just an illusion.

603
00:25:24,208 --> 00:25:27,250
It's all just make-believe!

604
00:25:27,333 --> 00:25:29,208
[spirit warbles]

605
00:25:30,333 --> 00:25:31,833
- [yelps]

606
00:25:33,916 --> 00:25:35,583
[spirit warbles]

607
00:25:36,875 --> 00:25:39,208
- A lesser spirit?

608
00:25:39,291 --> 00:25:42,000
Did you come here
just to help me out or...

609
00:25:44,208 --> 00:25:46,250
- Subaru.
- [gasps]

610
00:25:46,333 --> 00:25:48,666
So you saved me?

611
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,291
- I can tell
from that spiteful tone

612
00:25:50,375 --> 00:25:51,666
it's definitely you.

613
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:54,791
I may have a vivid subconscious,

614
00:25:54,875 --> 00:25:58,041
but it could never make such
a realistic imitation of you.

615
00:26:01,208 --> 00:26:03,000
It's a bewitching spell.

616
00:26:03,583 --> 00:26:05,750
We seem to be the only ones

617
00:26:05,833 --> 00:26:07,208
who have returned to normal.

618
00:26:07,291 --> 00:26:08,875
How did you make it back?

619
00:26:08,958 --> 00:26:11,291
- In my illusion,
I fought and burned a flower.

620
00:26:11,375 --> 00:26:12,875
- Is that so?

621
00:26:12,958 --> 00:26:15,375
Someone put a suggestion spell
on the flower's scent.

622
00:26:17,333 --> 00:26:20,250
- Hold on a sec.
What's that glow?

623
00:26:20,333 --> 00:26:22,416
It's the light
of my little buds.

624
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,750
I will now teach everyone
how to break out of the spell.

625
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:28,625
In. Nes.

631
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,750
My apologies, but I'm
afraid
you'll need to endure it.

632
00:26:46,833 --> 00:26:49,875
I can't spare the energy
needed
to fine-tune it just for you.

633
00:26:49,958 --> 00:26:52,958
Bringing them all back
is our priority.

634

- [yelps]

641
00:27:13,458 --> 00:27:14,250
- You need to kill me.

642
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:17,125
I won't accept this disgrace.

643
00:27:18,416 --> 00:27:20,666
Well, what is the meaning
of all of this?

644
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:23,208
You'll explain it to me,
right, Barusu?

645
00:27:23,291 --> 00:27:25,375
- I'd like to ask you
the same thing.

646
00:27:25,458 --> 00:27:26,791
We were just riding up,

647
00:27:26,875 --> 00:27:28,875
and you attacked us
out of nowhere.

648
00:27:28,958 --> 00:27:30,416
What were you thinking?

649
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,625
- You shouldn't have to ask
what I was thinking.

650
00:27:32,708 --> 00:27:34,250
That's rich,
coming from an ingrate like you.

651
00:27:34,333 --> 00:27:36,125
- What's that supposed to mean?

652
00:27:36,208 --> 00:27:38,125
- Don't you try to deny it.

653
00:27:38,208 --> 00:27:40,250
And after everything
that Lord Roswaal did for you,

654
00:27:40,333 --> 00:27:41,250
it's simply disgraceful.

655
00:27:41,333 --> 00:27:42,833
Once you're done with him,

656
00:27:42,916 --> 00:27:45,041
you rush to wag your tail
for another master.

657
00:27:45,125 --> 00:27:48,000
- Hang on. I think you've got
your stories all mixed up
here.

658
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:50,250
- You dare to bite
the hand that feeds you.

659
00:27:50,333 --> 00:27:51,250
Mangy mutt.

660
00:27:51,333 --> 00:27:52,041
- Listen to me.

661
00:27:52,125 --> 00:27:54,416
I wrote a letter,
a handwritten letter

662
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,416
explaining all this.

663
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,250
Wasn't it
delivered to the mansion?

664
00:27:57,333 --> 00:28:00,416
- Yes. I did receive one
from the capital.

665
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:03,375
But I found it laughable
and despicable

666
00:28:03,458 --> 00:28:05,208
that you would have the
gall
to send me a blank
letter.

667
00:28:05,291 --> 00:28:07,708
- Wait. It was blank?

668
00:28:07,791 --> 00:28:10,708
- The act of sending
a blank letter is a metaphor.

669
00:28:10,791 --> 00:28:11,750
It means that you
have nothing to discuss

670
00:28:11,833 --> 00:28:15,166
and have no intention
of speaking to the recipient.

671
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:17,500
It could easily be interpreted
as a declaration of war.

672
00:28:17,583 --> 00:28:19,583
- Uh, look,
that was an accident.

673
00:28:19,666 --> 00:28:22,208
You think I'm even
remotely clever enough

674
00:28:22,291 --> 00:28:23,083
to do something like that?

675
00:28:23,166 --> 00:28:24,958
- You dare to bite
the hand that feeds you.

676
00:28:25,041 --> 00:28:26,958
Reprehensible.

677
00:28:27,041 --> 00:28:28,166
- Stop saying that!

678
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:29,916
- I can't say it enough.

679
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,250
But now I get the idea.

680
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,458
The blank letter
was some kind of mistake,

681
00:28:34,541 --> 00:28:36,041
and you're still
Miss Emilia's dog.

682
00:28:36,125 --> 00:28:38,875
Is that correct?

683
00:28:38,958 --> 00:28:40,625
- Not exactly, but okay, fine.

684
00:28:40,708 --> 00:28:42,625
I mean, after all,
they're like family anyway.

685
00:28:42,708 --> 00:28:46,416
I'm cool with being a dog
if I'm Emilia's.

686
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,458
- Wouldn't you say
that such a low standard

687
00:28:47,541 --> 00:28:50,125
is a bit demeaning
and degrading?

688
00:28:50,208 --> 00:28:52,958
- In any case,
these guys are reinforcements.

689
00:28:53,041 --> 00:28:53,958
They're friends of ours.

690
00:28:54,041 --> 00:28:55,833
I pulled them together
as a special team

691
00:28:55,916 --> 00:28:58,083
designed to wipe out
the Witch's Cult.

692
00:28:58,166 --> 00:28:59,416
There's not much time now.

693
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,833
We need to start evacuating
the villagers.

694
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:05,333
[villagers murmuring]

695
00:29:08,041 --> 00:29:11,416
- Subaru, they seem
rather uneasy and skeptical.

696
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,041
Remember to be considerate.

697
00:29:13,125 --> 00:29:14,916
- [grunts]

698
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Hey, everybody!
How's it going?

699
00:29:17,083 --> 00:29:19,083
I haven't seen you guys
in quite a while,

700
00:29:19,166 --> 00:29:19,791
so thanks for showing up!

701
00:29:19,875 --> 00:29:22,000
Sorry to get
right to the point,

702
00:29:22,083 --> 00:29:23,250
but now that I
have your attention,

703
00:29:23,333 --> 00:29:24,083
I have a favor to ask.

704
00:29:24,166 --> 00:29:27,083
It seems that mabeasts
are up to no good

705
00:29:27,166 --> 00:29:29,166
out in the forest
near here once again.

706
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:30,958
So I've brought in
a few specialists

707
00:29:31,041 --> 00:29:33,375
from outside the village
to help exterminate them.

708
00:29:33,458 --> 00:29:35,333
But while they're here working,

709
00:29:35,416 --> 00:29:37,958
I'd like for all of you
to leave for the time being.

710
00:29:38,041 --> 00:29:40,333
- Don't try to fool us.
- [gasps]

711
00:29:40,416 --> 00:29:43,416
- I know you're trying to
sound
calm and cheerful about this,

712
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,208
but everyone
in the village is frightened.

713
00:29:44,291 --> 00:29:45,583
We feared all along

714
00:29:45,666 --> 00:29:48,166
that the Witch's Cult
would try something.

715
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:51,000
- Wait. The Witch's Cult?
What are you talking about?

716
00:29:51,083 --> 00:29:53,250
- Hang on a second.
- Why lie about this?

717
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:54,541
- Maybe he's trying
to hide something.

718
00:29:54,625 --> 00:29:57,208
- [murmuring continues]
- [sighs]

719
00:29:57,291 --> 00:29:59,958
- So you don't deny it, then?

720
00:30:00,041 --> 00:30:02,041
- Then that means
that it's all true, isn't it?

721
00:30:02,125 --> 00:30:03,416
- Why would they bother
a place like this?

722
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,958
- Come on.
The reason is obvious.

723
00:30:06,041 --> 00:30:07,125
It's 'cause of that half-elf.

724
00:30:07,208 --> 00:30:09,041
MAN: That's right.
The lord of the domain

725
00:30:09,125 --> 00:30:11,041
endorses a half-elf
for our ruler.

726
00:30:12,291 --> 00:30:14,125
- Why do you
have to make it about that,

727
00:30:14,208 --> 00:30:16,416
the half-elf thing?

728
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,375
Look, Emilia has
nothing to do with it!

729
00:30:17,458 --> 00:30:20,250
- She has everything
to do with it.

730
00:30:20,333 --> 00:30:22,000
If you keep company
with a half-elf,

731
00:30:22,083 --> 00:30:23,458
then the Witch's Cult shows up.

732
00:30:23,541 --> 00:30:26,166
Even the children
of this village know that.

733
00:30:27,291 --> 00:30:29,041
- You're kidding me.

734
00:30:29,125 --> 00:30:30,875
You guys seriously believe that?

735
00:30:30,958 --> 00:30:34,625
All of this is the fault
of the half-elf in the mansion?

736
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:37,958
[gasps]

737
00:30:38,041 --> 00:30:39,416
-<i> To the village?</i>

738
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,000
<i>It does sound nice,</i>

739
00:30:41,083 --> 00:30:42,291
<i>but it might cause</i>
<i>trouble for you</i>

740
00:30:42,375 --> 00:30:43,250
<i>if we went there together.</i>

741
00:30:43,333 --> 00:30:44,750
- [gasps]

742
00:30:44,833 --> 00:30:48,416
So does that mean
I'm just being selfish again?

743
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,125
Serving my own personal needs?

744
00:30:50,208 --> 00:30:51,875
Agh!

745
00:30:52,166 --> 00:30:54,041
[gasps]

746
00:30:54,125 --> 00:30:57,041
- Lift up your head,
and don't look down.

747
00:30:57,125 --> 00:30:59,500
That's exactly what Miss
Crusch
would say to you right neow.

748
00:30:59,583 --> 00:31:00,250
- What do you mean?

749
00:31:00,333 --> 00:31:02,416
- Do you believe anything

750
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,250
you were trying
to get them to do was wrong?

751
00:31:04,333 --> 00:31:05,083
If your answer is neo,

752
00:31:05,166 --> 00:31:07,333
there isn't any reason
to look down.

753
00:31:07,416 --> 00:31:09,916
Or is it somehow harder
to lift your head up here

754
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,333
than it was to throw a tantrum

755
00:31:11,416 --> 00:31:12,333
in front of everybody
back at the castle?

756
00:31:12,416 --> 00:31:14,500
- Come on. That's--

757
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,916
Wait. You're right.

758
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:20,125
Compared to what I did
that day, this is nothing.

759
00:31:21,916 --> 00:31:24,125
I understand your feelings
and concerns very well!

760
00:31:24,208 --> 00:31:28,250
I'm not gonna try to convince
you to change your minds now.

761
00:31:28,333 --> 00:31:30,583
Obviously you'll have
your own beliefs about things.

762
00:31:30,666 --> 00:31:33,125
It hurts, but I understand.

763
00:31:33,208 --> 00:31:33,708
- [grunts]

764
00:31:33,791 --> 00:31:34,541
- But whatever you believe,

765
00:31:34,625 --> 00:31:36,625
please accept my request.

766
00:31:36,708 --> 00:31:37,666
I need you all
to clear out of here!

767
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:41,000
It's dangerous
to stay in the village,

768
00:31:41,083 --> 00:31:42,000
and that's the truth.

769
00:31:42,083 --> 00:31:43,125
[villager murmuring]

770
00:31:44,541 --> 00:31:47,333
- The words
of my household's employee

771
00:31:47,416 --> 00:31:49,166
are those of our master,
Lord Roswaal himself.

772
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:51,166
- What are you...

773
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:54,583
- So follow his instructions
immediately.

774
00:31:54,666 --> 00:31:55,666
- [overlapping chatter]
- Hey, come on. Let's Move.

775
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:56,916
- Tell him we're here.

776
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:00,166
SUBARU: You saved me back there.

777
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:00,750
Thanks a lot.

778
00:32:00,833 --> 00:32:03,500
- Even so--
- What is it?

779
00:32:03,583 --> 00:32:05,958
- I've gotta admit having you
take my side so easily

780
00:32:06,041 --> 00:32:08,000
is something
that's never happened before.

781
00:32:08,083 --> 00:32:10,500
So does that mean
you've acknowledged me?

782
00:32:10,583 --> 00:32:11,583
- [scoffs]

783
00:32:11,666 --> 00:32:13,083
PETRA: Subaru!

784
00:32:13,166 --> 00:32:15,041
- Oh, hey, Petra.
What's going on?

785
00:32:15,125 --> 00:32:16,125
Do you need something?!

786
00:32:16,208 --> 00:32:17,875
- Well, i-is--

787
00:32:17,958 --> 00:32:20,750
is the lady from the mansion
gonna run away with us, too?

788
00:32:20,833 --> 00:32:21,333
- Wha?

789
00:32:21,416 --> 00:32:23,458
- She was here.

790
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:24,708
She came to the village
yesterday.

791
00:32:24,791 --> 00:32:28,041
She told us we should all
come to the mansion

792
00:32:28,125 --> 00:32:30,666
and stay with her because it's
dangerous here right now,

793
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,666
just like you said.

794
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:34,041
She warned us,

795
00:32:34,125 --> 00:32:37,416
but no one in the village
would even listen to her.

796
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,208
- [gasps]
- It's all right.

797
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:42,250
She'll be fine.
Don't worry about a thing.

798
00:32:42,333 --> 00:32:43,750
So go on and get moving now.

799
00:32:43,833 --> 00:32:44,791
- Okay.

800
00:32:48,583 --> 00:32:50,250
- What happened
to Emilia after that?

801
00:32:50,333 --> 00:32:52,333
RAM: You should know her
well enough to realize

802
00:32:52,416 --> 00:32:54,291
she's not so perceptive
as to back down

803
00:32:54,375 --> 00:32:56,125
the moment someone denies her.

804
00:32:56,208 --> 00:32:58,916
- That's true, but I also know
she isn't the kind of girl

805
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,875
who wouldn't be hurt
by mean words hurled at her.

806
00:33:00,958 --> 00:33:04,208
- She came down and tried
to convince the villagers

807
00:33:04,291 --> 00:33:06,125
to leave or join her
in the mansion,

808
00:33:06,208 --> 00:33:07,208
but they all refused.

809
00:33:07,291 --> 00:33:08,000
She couldn't do nothing,

810
00:33:08,083 --> 00:33:10,708
so she repaired
the forest barrier,

811
00:33:10,791 --> 00:33:13,625
because she feared there
might be another mabeast attack.

812
00:33:13,708 --> 00:33:14,708
Well, doing all that
wasn't a bad decision

813
00:33:14,791 --> 00:33:18,041
in and of itself, but still...

814
00:33:18,125 --> 00:33:20,208
[footsteps crunching]

815
00:33:20,291 --> 00:33:21,708
- Hey, Julius.
- [gasps]

816
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:23,583
- I was hoping you'd join me.

817
00:33:23,666 --> 00:33:25,250
I'm gonna go and explain
things to Emilia

818
00:33:25,333 --> 00:33:26,625
and the little girl
in the mansion.

819
00:33:26,708 --> 00:33:28,250
Think it would be
a lot more convincing

820
00:33:28,333 --> 00:33:29,625
if you were
to come along with me.

821
00:33:29,708 --> 00:33:30,583
I mean, after all,
you are a knight.

822
00:33:30,666 --> 00:33:33,125
Just take it as my way

823
00:33:33,208 --> 00:33:35,750
of trying to make up
for going nuts in the castle.

824
00:33:36,375 --> 00:33:38,375
- I see.

825
00:33:39,791 --> 00:33:42,416
If that will help the discussion
to go more smoothly,

826
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,541
then don't hesitate to use me.

827
00:33:44,625 --> 00:33:46,416
- And another thing.

828
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,125
That little spirit I had on me,

829
00:33:48,208 --> 00:33:50,416
you were the one
who put it there, weren't you?

830
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,041
So how are you able to do that?

831
00:33:52,125 --> 00:33:52,791
I get that you're
a spirit arts user,

832
00:33:52,875 --> 00:33:55,500
but I don't get
how it all works.

833
00:33:55,583 --> 00:33:56,750
- To be more precise
about it,

834
00:33:56,833 --> 00:33:59,041
I prefer to be called
a Spirit Knight.

835
00:33:59,125 --> 00:34:01,666
I do use the spirit arts,
of course,

836
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:05,375
but that hasn't prevented me
from also training with a
sword.

837
00:34:05,458 --> 00:34:07,083
- Then you're the one

838
00:34:07,166 --> 00:34:10,041
who set that helpful
little red thing on me?

839
00:34:10,125 --> 00:34:11,625
- "Set it on you"
is a harsh way to put it.

840
00:34:11,708 --> 00:34:15,083
That was Ia.
I was only having her

841
00:34:15,166 --> 00:34:17,000
secretly guard you
and keep you safe.

842
00:34:17,083 --> 00:34:19,583
- Oh, by the way, what was
that other thing you did

843
00:34:19,666 --> 00:34:20,541
when you broke
the illusion earlier?

844
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:24,458
- It's a high class of magic
known as<i> Nect.</i>

845
00:34:24,541 --> 00:34:27,125
It connects the gates
of everyone who is in range

846
00:34:27,208 --> 00:34:29,083
so they can easily
communicate with each other.

847
00:34:30,375 --> 00:34:31,291
It appeared to work

848
00:34:31,375 --> 00:34:32,833
a bit too well on you, though.

849
00:34:32,916 --> 00:34:34,041
- Yeah, no kidding.

850
00:34:34,125 --> 00:34:36,291
I thought my head
was gonna split open.

851
00:34:36,375 --> 00:34:39,291
- It's unusual for the spirits
to mistake the tuning.

852
00:34:39,375 --> 00:34:41,333
It could be something else.

853
00:34:41,416 --> 00:34:42,708
Perhaps you have
a strong affinity

854
00:34:42,791 --> 00:34:43,833
towards the spirit world.

855
00:34:43,916 --> 00:34:45,291
- [scoffs]

856
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:47,000
Sadly, the only spirit
I ever made friends with

857
00:34:47,083 --> 00:34:51,083
was a little gray cat
with a lot of attitude.

858
00:34:52,583 --> 00:34:54,291
- Well, did you patch
things up with Julius?

859
00:34:54,375 --> 00:34:56,500
Fill me in.

860
00:34:56,583 --> 00:34:57,583
- Uh, I'm gonna take
that matter back with me

861
00:34:57,666 --> 00:34:59,666
and mull it over carefully

862
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:01,333
before making
an optimistic decision.

863
00:35:01,416 --> 00:35:04,500
I think you should come
down to the mansion with me.

864
00:35:04,583 --> 00:35:06,291
I'm gonna need
at least one person there

865
00:35:06,375 --> 00:35:07,333
from the Crusch camp.

866
00:35:07,416 --> 00:35:08,416
I've gotta smooth over

867
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,666
the misunderstanding
with the letter.

868
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:11,333
- [sighs] Fine.

869
00:35:11,416 --> 00:35:13,375
I'll do that
after I finish up my work,

870
00:35:13,458 --> 00:35:15,666
Come to think of it,
I could use your help here.

871
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:17,250
It involves the Witch's Cult,
so it's kinda dangerous.

872
00:35:17,333 --> 00:35:21,500
The contract said he'd buy
their cargo at the asking price,

873
00:35:21,583 --> 00:35:23,791
so we need to inspect
the goods thoroughly.

874
00:35:23,875 --> 00:35:27,333
- Wait. Really? A task like that
shouldn't be our job, should it?

875
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:28,375
Don't we have more impor--

876
00:35:28,458 --> 00:35:29,625
- Oh, come on. It'll be fun.

877
00:35:29,708 --> 00:35:32,125
- Hey, hey.
Now take it easy, you two.

878
00:35:32,208 --> 00:35:33,666
No lovers' quarrels
in my carriage.

Looks like you're
in trouble neow, Subaru.

881
00:35:38,333 --> 00:35:40,875
Goodness.
I can't take him anywhere.

882
00:35:40,958 --> 00:35:42,458
You let your guard down.

883
00:35:42,541 --> 00:35:44,375
- Eh?

884
00:35:44,458 --> 00:35:45,458
[groans]

885
00:35:48,541 --> 00:35:50,583
- This guy is one
of the Witch's Cult.

886
00:35:50,666 --> 00:35:52,791
I touched him earlier
to confirm it.

887
00:35:52,875 --> 00:35:54,875
There's some weird spell
implanted in him

888
00:35:54,958 --> 00:35:57,375
just like the fingers
of the Sin Archbishop's.

889
00:35:57,458 --> 00:35:58,333
- There was one
among the merchants?

890
00:35:58,416 --> 00:36:01,458
- That's the reason
I snuck into his carriage,

891
00:36:01,541 --> 00:36:03,708
so I could get under his guard.

892
00:36:03,791 --> 00:36:06,541
- Neow, then, I want you
to tell us the details

893
00:36:06,625 --> 00:36:08,333
of what your little cult's
been plotting.

the gentlest ones in the world,

some nasty things, too.

- It's what?

00:36:17,625 --> 00:36:18,000
- over.

I was wondering
when you'd wake up.

908
00:36:38,833 --> 00:36:41,583
- Why are you dressed like that?

909
00:36:41,666 --> 00:36:43,333
- I had neo choice.

910
00:36:43,416 --> 00:36:46,166
It isn't as if I can reproduce
clothes with healing magic.

911
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:48,583
- Regardless, given our
horrific circumstances,

are all right.

- By stowing away
in the carriages.

918
00:37:01,875 --> 00:37:03,875
There was a finger
hiding among the merchants,

00:37:03,958 --> 00:37:05,708
and we didn't know
'til it was too late.

00:38:50,791 --> 00:38:53,333
It's a special gift
from your precious Witch!

This is what you're
looking for, right?

- Eh? [gasps]

967
00:38:56,833 --> 00:38:58,875
No-good thief. How could you?!

968
00:38:58,958 --> 00:39:01,708
Those words were not meant
for your unworthy eyes!

969
00:39:01,791 --> 00:39:03,083
- Enough with the shouting.

970
00:39:03,166 --> 00:39:05,000
'Cause if you keep on
yelling at me like that,

971
00:39:05,083 --> 00:39:06,833
it's gonna make
my brain tremble.

972

We can handle things here.

976
00:39:14,083 --> 00:39:15,083
You just keep up
with your end of the plan,

977
00:39:15,166 --> 00:39:17,666
and be sure
to take care of Wilhelm.

978
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:19,916
- Not too specific
with your orders, are you?

979
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,625
- But very well.
- [sighs]

it seems the ending's
finally arrived.

- Question.

Do you know what this is?

- Huh?

1000
00:40:05,833 --> 00:40:08,250
- It's a magic stone
used for creating barriers.

1001
00:40:08,333 --> 00:40:11,041
See, they were all stashed away
in trees throughout the forest.

1002
00:40:11,125 --> 00:40:12,541
What, you didn't
even notice them?

1003

- Magic stones?

is a mabeast breeding ground.

People like you and me
are a prime feast for them.

among them now.

Once that one's gone,
it's all over.

[music playing]

- It's Emilia.

1030
00:41:27,208 --> 00:41:30,583
- Now stand down this instant.

- Wait!

- Let go of me.
I can't wait around right now.

1039
00:41:48,166 --> 00:41:49,875
Do you want to make Emilia
fight him herself?

1040
00:41:49,958 --> 00:41:52,875

a little faith in her, okay?

My Witch, my love's guide!

Show me more
of your incredible abilities!

blame you at all

Behold, this is
love's true ending.

1059
00:42:37,041 --> 00:42:39,583
The ripened fruit of my love,
proof that the Witch

1060
00:42:39,666 --> 00:42:42,125
has accepted my love
and returned it in kind!

the one to tell you,

but that proof doesn't exist.

1063
