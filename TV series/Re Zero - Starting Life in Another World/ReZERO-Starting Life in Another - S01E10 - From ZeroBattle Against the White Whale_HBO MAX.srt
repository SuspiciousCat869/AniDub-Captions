166
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:07,875
Knowing you, it must be
because you've had

167
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:09,375
another great idea about
what our next move should be,

168
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:11,875
something to help Miss Emilia
and Lord Roswaal.

169
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,833
That's it, right?

170
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:16,000
- That's not what this is, Rem.
- Huh?

171
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:19,541
- There's nothing
I can do in the capital,

172
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:21,166
and I'd be every bit
as powerless

173
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,875
if I headed back to the mansion.

174
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:26,958
That's what I figured out.

175
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:29,250
So again, run away with me.
Please, Rem.

176
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:32,791
Staying here is not an option.

177
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:35,916
That's what everyone's been
telling me this whole time.

178
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,041
I didn't want to believe
that it was true,

179
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:40,583
so I denied it
with all my might.

180
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:41,458
But yeah, they were right.

181
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:44,500
No one ever needed me around
for anything.

182
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:46,958
- No, that's not--
- It's a cold, hard fact!

183
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:48,833
It's been plainly
spelled out for me

184
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:50,416
over and over again.

185
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,250
That's why I've decided
to just disappear.

186
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:56,250
It's for the best. Anything I do

187
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:59,083
will just lead to a dead body
or maybe more,

188
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:00,916
depending on what happens.

189
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,625
I've had enough of all this.

190
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:06,916
Let's run, Rem.

191
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,875
You and I can't stay here.

192
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:11,750
[gasps] We shouldn't
be in this country!

193
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:16,166
- But this is all so sudden.
I can't think straight.

194
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,166
- I'm sorry it's coming
from out of nowhere.

195
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,791
I really am,
but we don't have time.

196
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:21,708
I know it's not fair to ask...

197
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:25,958
but you must make a choice.

198
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:27,750
- What do you mean?

199
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:30,333
- Choose me,
or choose someone else,

200
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:31,875
but you have to choose.

201
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:36,500
Let's get a dragon-drawn
carriage and head west.

202
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:39,083
We'll leave Lugunica
and go far west to...

203
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:40,708
Kararagi, was it?

204
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:43,125
We'll buy a little house
and live there together.

205
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,000
Even if bad things happen,

206
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:47,916
I can keep going
if you're there.

207
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,958
Just having someone waiting
at home for me with a smile.

208
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:52,333
No matter how tired I am,

209
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:55,166
if I know you're waiting for me,
I can make it through anything.

210
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,958
[gasps]

211
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:59,583
So please, choose me.

212
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,208
'Cause if you do,
I'll give you all that I have

213
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:03,708
for the rest of my life.

214
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:05,333
I'm begging you.

215
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:07,291
Let's run away from here.

216
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:09,458
Live out your life with me!

217
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,375
- [chuckles]

218
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:17,750
Subaru.

219
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:18,875
- [gasps]

220
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:19,791
- Look, I--

221
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:22,958
I'm sorry,
but I can't run away with you.

222
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:23,791
We have a plan.

223
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:26,000
I mean, we're supposed
to sit around

224
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:29,041
and laugh together as we
talk about the future, remember?

225
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:31,250
- [sighs] I remember.

226
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:33,375
And maybe
we can't laugh now, but,

227
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:35,708
you know, once we start,

228
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:36,666
once we actually get moving,

229
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:37,500
then I bet we can
both find a way--

230
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:39,791
- I've thought about it,
too, you know?

231
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:45,208
We would arrive in Kararagi

232
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:47,000
and rent a place to stay.

233
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:49,208
As long as we had a home
and some work,

234
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:50,375
we could manage
to get by somehow.

235
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:53,541
Fortunately,
thanks to the graciousness

236
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:56,333
of Lord Roswaal, I've received
a formal education,

237
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:58,375
so I think
it would be easy for me

238
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:01,125
to find some kind of work,
even in Kararagi.

239
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:03,833
You, on the other hand,
might have to do manual labor

240
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:05,208
or maybe
just take care of things

241
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:08,916
around whatever work I have,
like an assistant or something.

242
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,416
Once the two of us
had a stable income,

243
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,750
we could look
for a better place to live.

244
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:15,125
In the meantime,

245
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:17,541
you could study
for maybe a year or two

246
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:20,666
so that you'd be able to go out
and find a decent job,

247
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:23,125
something that would benefit
from your creativity.

248
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:26,541
We would go to work,
spend our evenings together,

249
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:29,333
and once we had enough money,
we could buy a house,

250
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:32,750
maybe even open up
a little shop of our very own.

251
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:35,750
After all, Kararagi is
a pretty thriving town,

252
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:36,416
so I'm sure
we could earn a living

253
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,375
on one of your fanciful ideas.

254
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:40,375
And once our jobs
were on track,

255
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:43,416
um, it's embarrassing to say,

256
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,166
but we could have a baby.

257
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:47,375
The child would be
half-demon and half-human,

258
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:50,083
so I'm sure it would be feisty,

259
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:52,250
but I know that they would
be completely adorable,

260
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:55,750
whether we ended up with a boy,
a girl, twins, or even triplets.

261
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:57,625
I'm sure that it wouldn't be

262
00:11:57,708 --> 00:12:00,125
all fun and games
and good times,

263
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:02,041
and I know not everything
would work out

264
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:04,125
exactly the way
I imagined it.

265
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:06,083
I mean, the two of us
might end up

266
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:08,041
having only daughters
and no sons,

267
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:09,625
so if you were hoping
to pass down your family name,

268
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:12,791
you might end up
being disappointed with that.

269
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:14,208
- Rem, I--
- But either way,

270
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:15,291
you've no need to worry.

271
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:16,875
Even when
the children grow up

272
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:19,375
and reach the age where they
might begin to treat you coldly,

273
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:21,708
I'll still be right there
by your side.

274
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:23,166
In the neighborhood,
we'll be known

275
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,458
as a couple
of old, romantic lovebirds,

276
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:28,041
the kind who still laugh
and flirt with each other

277
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:29,208
after so many years...

278
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:32,083
growing old together.

279
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:33,708
- Then why don't--

280
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:36,291
- I would feel bad
for doing such a thing to you,

281
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:39,541
but I would prefer to die
before you if possible.

282
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:42,333
I want to die quietly
in the home we'd made together,

283
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:43,541
lying on our bed
with your hand in mine,

284
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:45,625
surrounded by our children
and their children,

285
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:49,500
and I'd say,
"I lived such a happy life,"

286
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:52,250
then, with all you there,
take my last breath.

287
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:55,166
If I could do that,

288
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,083
I'd end my life so happily,

289
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:58,875
so very happily.

290
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:00,875
- I don't understand.

291
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:02,500
Then why, Rem?

292
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:05,000
If you want it that badly,
then why can't--

293
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:06,458
- Because you're not smiling.

294
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:09,333
If you really wanted
that future,

295
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:12,041
one with the two of us
growing old together,

296
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,500
- I would die so happy.
- [gasps]

297
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:17,250
- I would love
a future like that with you,

298
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:19,208
and knowing you truly care
enough about me

299
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:20,333
to want me there with you
when you run away,

300
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:23,041
leaving everything behind,

301
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:25,333
makes me happy
from the bottom of my heart.

302
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:28,333
But I'm afraid I can't do it.

303
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:30,958
Because I know...

304
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:33,458
that if we ran away
together now,

305
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:34,583
the Subaru I'd be leaving behind

306
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:38,000
would be the Subaru
that I love most.

307
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:41,250
Now please...

308
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:43,416
tell me what happened
that's bothering you so.

309
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,375
- [sighs]

310
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:47,083
- If you can't tell me,
then just trust me.

311
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:49,041
I swear that I'll
do something to make it right.

312
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:51,458
- [gasps]

313
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:54,000
- But for now, at least,
we should return to the manor.

314
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,708
If we can take our time
and consider things calmly,

315
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:57,416
maybe we can find
a different answer

316
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,916
to whatever the problem is.

317
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,333
- I've agonized over this.

318
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:03,625
I've thought about it.

319
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:04,333
I've suffered for it!

320
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:07,083
And that's why...

321
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:08,625
I'm giving up.

322
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:12,708
- Look, it's easy to do, but...

323
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:18,125
- Did you just say
what I thought you said?

324
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:19,416
- Subaru, you're shaking.

325
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,250
- Don't give me that crap!

326
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:23,708
There's nothing easy
about giving up, nothing!

327
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:26,416
You think
I'm just doing nothing,

328
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,541
thinking about nothing,

329
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:29,583
cutting myself off
from everything,

330
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:31,750
throwing my entire life away,

331
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:34,250
leaving every last thing
I know and care about behind,

332
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:36,666
and that's all it took
for me to call it quits?!

333
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,166
That's a lie!

334
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,958
It was never that easy for me!

335
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:42,458
It was so much easier for me
to go on thinking

336
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:45,625
that there was something I could
do to make a real difference!

337
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:48,208
But I know now
that there's nothing I can do!

338
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:50,291
There's no way out! Understand?!

339
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:53,208
The only path everything
leads to is giving up!

340
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:57,041
If I could do something,
then I'd do it.

341
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:58,291
I swear that I would.

342
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:03,125
- Listen to me.

343
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:04,416
- [crying]

344
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,041
- It is easy to give up.

345
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:12,125
But it doesn't suit you at all.

346
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:16,125
I don't know what painful things
you've been through

347
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:19,250
or what you've done that
makes you suffer so terribly.

348
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:21,375
And I know
it would be wrong of me

349
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:23,250
to say that I understand
whatever it is

350
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:25,125
you've been experiencing
to make you feel this way.

351
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:28,208
It would.

352
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:29,708
Even so...

353
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:32,708
there's something
that I do know about all this.

354
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:36,333
I know for certain
that you are someone

355
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:38,958
who cannot give up on something
when you're halfway through.

356
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:41,583
And I know for certain

357
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:43,166
that you are someone
who can smile

358
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:47,333
when you talk about all of your
hopes and wishes for the future.

359
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:50,166
And I know for certain

360
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:53,333
that you are someone who can't
give up on the future,

361
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:55,083
no matter what.

362
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:57,875
- I'm sorry, but you're wrong.

363
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:00,375
- I'm not that kind of person.
- I'm not wrong.

364
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:02,625
You haven't given up on us,

365
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:06,000
not Miss Emilia or Sister,
on Lord Roswaal,

366
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:08,625
or Miss Beatrice
or on anyone else.

367
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:10,250
That isn't who you are.

368
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:12,208
- You don't know
what you're talking about.

369
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:13,583
I have given up.

370
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:16,458
Carrying it all was impossible
from the very start.

371
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:20,333
My hands are so small that it
all slipped through my fingers,

372
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:21,708
leaving nothing behind.

373
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:23,500
- No, that's not true.

374
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,208
That's not true at all.
You have--

375
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:27,375
- Bullshit! What do you know?!

376
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:30,083
What the hell do you
actually know about me, huh?!

377
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:31,375
Nothing!

378
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:33,708
I'll tell you
what kind of man I really am.

379
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:36,041
I have no strength,
but I want it all.

380
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:37,291
I have no knowledge,
but all I do is dream.

381
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:41,500
There's nothing I could do but
struggle in vain like an idiot!

382
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:44,333
I...

383
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:45,375
I hate...

384
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:48,416
I hate myself!

385
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,500
All I do is talk a big game

386
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:52,083
and make myself
sound like a big shot

387
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:53,333
when I can't do anything!

388
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:54,083
I never do anything,

389
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:56,458
yet I complain
with the best of them,

390
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:57,375
like it's my job or something.

391
00:16:57,458 --> 00:17:00,250
Who the hell do I think I am?!
I'm a fraud.

392
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:03,750
It's amazing that I can live
like this and not feel ashamed.

393
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:05,250
You know I'm right!

394
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,208
I'm an empty shell.

395
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:09,500
There's nothing
inside me at all.

396
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:12,208
I know there isn't.

397
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:14,375
Guess that's obvious.

398
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:16,416
Anybody could see that.

399
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,541
Before I came to this place,

400
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:19,750
before I got in the situation
that led me to all of you,

401
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:23,166
do you have any idea
what I did with my life?

402
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:26,000
I did nothing, that's what.

403
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:29,250
I've never done
a single thing worth mentioning.

404
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:31,125
I had all that time and freedom,

405
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:33,291
but I just squandered it away
on nothing.

406
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:33,916
I could have done
anything with my life,

407
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,875
but I never did a damn thing,

408
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:38,208
and what you're
looking at now is the result,

409
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,166
this cowardly, weak,
worthless crybaby.

410
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:43,625
All of my powerlessness,
all of my incompetence,

411
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:47,458
it's the product of my rotten
and pathetic character.

412
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:49,291
Wanting to accomplish
something important

413
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:50,208
when I've never done
anything to earn it

414
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:52,916
goes way beyond
the limitations of arrogance.

415
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,625
The cost of my lifetime
of laziness

416
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:56,791
and all the wasteful habits
I forged along the way

417
00:17:56,875 --> 00:18:00,708
just ends up killing
both you and me.

418
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:02,708
[inhales]

419
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:03,708
That's right.

420
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,541
I have no character,

421
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:07,041
even when I thought
I could go on living here

422
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:09,958
and nothing changed
about who I really am.

423
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:14,291
The old man back at the manor
saw that part of me perfectly,

424
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:15,083
didn't he?

425
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:17,833
I wasn't trying to get stronger

426
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:18,583
or trying to make things better.

427
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:21,208
That was a lie.

428
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:22,666
I was just striking
an obvious pose

429
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:25,000
to justify myself, to say
that I was trying my best,

430
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:27,916
that it wasn't like I
wasn't doing anything,

431
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,750
to able to appear to be
doing everything I could.

432
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:31,791
I wanted to say
I couldn't help it,

433
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:34,833
to be told that it
couldn't be helped.

434
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:37,500
I was only pretending
to push my body to the limit

435
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:40,500
so that all of those excuses
would be possible!

436
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:42,416
Even when I had you
help me study,

437
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,666
I was just posing to cover up
how embarrassed I felt

438
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,000
to be such an incompetent idiot!

439
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:49,750
Deep down inside,
at the core of my heart,

440
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:52,500
I'm just a small, cowardly,
filthy piece of trash

441
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:54,291
who's always worried
about how others see me,

442
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:55,166
how they'll accept or judge me,

443
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:59,541
and nothing--nothing
about me has changed!

444
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:01,500
[crying]

445
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:07,708
I've known it
since the very beginning.

446
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:09,583
Everything that was happening
was my fault.

447
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:12,583
I'm the lowest of the low.

448
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,708
I absolutely...

449
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:17,208
hate myself.

450
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:22,583
- Listen to me.

451
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:24,041
I know that no matter how deeply

452
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:27,416
you've fallen
into the pit of darkness,

453
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,833
you still have enough courage
to reach out your hand.

454
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:35,541
I love it when you
run your hand along my hair.

455
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:37,750
I feel as though
we can understand each other

456
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:39,333
without ever saying a word,

457
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:41,666
just through
that bit of contact.

458
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,750
I love the sound of your voice.

459
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:45,083
Just hearing you
say a single word

460
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:47,083
makes my heart flutter
and feel warmer.

461
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:50,750
I love how much of you
I see in your eyes.

462
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:52,750
Normally they look
so stern and serious,

463
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:55,208
but in those moments when
you're being kind to someone,

464
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:58,000
I really love
the way they soften.

465
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:01,458
I love your fingers, too.

466
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:03,833
For a boy, they're so delicate.

467
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:05,583
But when they hold mine,

468
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:08,541
I know they're the strong,
slender fingers of a man.

469
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,458
They make me feel safe.

470
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:13,375
I love the way you move
when you're walking.

471
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:15,625
Whenever we're out
walking together,

472
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:17,458
I love the way
you occasionally turn

473
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:19,625
to make sure
I'm keeping up with you

474
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:21,458
and never leave me behind.

475
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:22,625
- Stop.

476
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:23,958
- I love the way
you look when you sleep.

477
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:27,250
You seem unguarded,
like an infant,

478
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:29,333
and your eyelashes
are so long.

479
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:31,666
When I touch your cheek,
you calm down.

480
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,708
And when I playfully
touch your lips,

481
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:35,458
you don't even notice.

482
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:37,791
And it makes my heart
ache terribly.

483
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:38,666
I love you.

484
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:41,791
- Why would you say that?

485
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:43,625
- When you said
that you hate yourself

486
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:45,125
and told me all the reasons
why you feel that way,

487
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:48,000
it made me want
to counter those reasons

488
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:50,375
and tell you all
the absolutely wonderful things

489
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:51,750
I know and love about you.

490
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:54,000
- You're just seeing
what you want to see!

491
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:55,875
Those things were all phony!

492
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:56,833
That isn't me.

493
00:20:56,916 --> 00:20:59,625
I know myself
better than anybody ever could!

494
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:02,333
- That's not true!
All you know is yourself!

495
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:05,583
How much do you know
about the Subaru that I see?

496
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:08,250
[crying] The one I was
just telling you about?

497
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:10,958
- Why?

498
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:14,000
Why do you like me so much?

499
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:18,000
'Cause I'm--I'm nothing
but a small weakling.

500
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:21,708
I'm running, running away
just like I did last time,

501
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:23,916
so why do you
even care about me?

502
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,333
- You don't know?

503
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:28,000
Because you're my hero, Subaru.

504

[wings fluttering]

505
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:32,833
Back in that dark forest,

506
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:35,041
when I didn't even know
who I was anymore

507
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:36,875
and couldn't think of anything
but violently lashing out,

508
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:39,708
you were the one who saved me.

509
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:40,375
- [singing in Japanese]

510
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:43,125
- When I woke up
unable to move

511
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:45,750
and Sister was exhausted
after using too much magic,

512
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:47,375
you faced the mabeasts
all alone

513
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:49,416
as a diversion
so we could escape.

514
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,000
There was no way you could win,

515
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:53,625
and your life
was in real danger,

516
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:57,416
but you still stayed and
made your way back to my arms

517
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,583
so warm from the battle.

518
00:21:59,666 --> 00:22:02,000
When you finally woke up,
you smiled at me

519
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:04,458
and said the words
I wanted to hear most

520
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:05,375
when I wanted
to hear it the most

521
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:08,458
from the one I wanted
to most hear them from.

522
00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:13,708
My time has been stopped
for so very long.

523
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:16,000
Ever since
that horrible fiery night,

524
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:17,916
that tragic night
I lost everything

525
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,916
I had in this world
except for my sister,

526
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,750
my time has been stopped.

527
00:22:22,833 --> 00:22:24,916
It was you
who melted my frozen heart,

528
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,041
and through your never-ending
care and kindness,

529
00:22:27,125 --> 00:22:28,000
made the time
that had been stopped for me

530
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:31,000
for so long start moving again.

531
00:22:32,166 --> 00:22:32,833
I'm sure you have no idea

532
00:22:32,916 --> 00:22:35,416
how you saved me that morning

533
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,458
or just how happy
you made me feel.

534
00:22:37,541 --> 00:22:39,666
There was
so much joy inside me.

535
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,958
I couldn't hold back the tears.

536
00:22:42,041 --> 00:22:42,958
Understand?

537
00:22:43,041 --> 00:22:45,708
That's why I believe,

538
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:48,583
no matter what painful things
may happen,

539
00:22:48,666 --> 00:22:51,500
even when it looks
like you'll go down in flames,

540
00:22:51,583 --> 00:22:54,791
when no one else in the entire
world believes in you,

541
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:56,625
when you don't even
believe in yourself

542
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:58,458
and you think
that you can't go on,

543
00:22:58,541 --> 00:23:00,750
I will still believe in you.

544
00:23:00,833 --> 00:23:03,208
[singing continues]

545
00:23:03,291 --> 00:23:04,875
- [cries]

546
00:23:07,875 --> 00:23:10,875
- The Subaru who came
into my life and saved me

547
00:23:10,958 --> 00:23:13,666
is the hero
that I will always call mine.

548
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,000
[singing continues]

549
00:23:25,208 --> 00:23:28,708
- No matter what I did
or how hard I tried,

550
00:23:28,791 --> 00:23:30,250
I couldn't manage
to save anyone.

551
00:23:31,291 --> 00:23:33,041
- I'm here.

552
00:23:33,125 --> 00:23:34,416
Don't you see?

553
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,583
The Rem you saved
is right here.

554
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:39,083
- I've never done anything.

555
00:23:39,166 --> 00:23:41,000
I'm empty.

556
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:43,208
No one will even listen to me.

557
00:23:43,291 --> 00:23:45,000
- I'm right here.

558
00:23:45,083 --> 00:23:48,000
I'm ready to listen
to anything you have to say.

559
00:23:48,083 --> 00:23:49,125
I want to.

560
00:23:49,208 --> 00:23:52,833
- No one expects
anything of me.

561
00:23:52,916 --> 00:23:54,708
No one in the world
believes in me.

562
00:23:56,666 --> 00:23:58,958
I'm no good. I hate myself.

563
00:24:01,666 --> 00:24:02,833
- No matter how you feel
about yourself,

564
00:24:02,916 --> 00:24:05,583
I still love you.

565
00:24:09,875 --> 00:24:12,500
- You really don't mind
that it's me?

566
00:24:12,583 --> 00:24:14,333
- I want it to be you.

567
00:24:14,416 --> 00:24:17,625
I wouldn't want for it
to be anyone else.

568
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,875
If you can't forgive yourself

569
00:24:21,958 --> 00:24:23,541
for being empty
and having nothing,

570
00:24:23,625 --> 00:24:28,083
then let's start from here
right now at this very moment.

571
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:30,666
- Start what?

572
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:32,541
- Just like when you
started time for me

573
00:24:32,625 --> 00:24:33,750
after it had been stopped
for so long,

574
00:24:33,833 --> 00:24:37,875
we'll make the time that you
feel has somehow stopped for you

575
00:24:37,958 --> 00:24:39,958
begin to move again.

576
00:24:40,041 --> 00:24:42,166
Let's start over right here...

577
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:45,291
from square one.

578
00:24:46,291 --> 00:24:49,500
No, we'll start from zero.

579
00:24:49,791 --> 00:24:51,875
- [gasps]

580
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:56,708
- If it's too hard
for you to walk on your own,

581
00:24:56,791 --> 00:24:57,291
then I'll hold you up.

582
00:24:57,375 --> 00:24:59,458
We can both share the burden

583
00:24:59,541 --> 00:25:01,708
supporting each other,
walking side by side.

584
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:05,166
Isn't that more or less what
you said to me that morning?

585
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,875
Show me how awesome
you can be, Subaru.

586
00:25:08,958 --> 00:25:10,083
Show them all.

587
00:25:12,125 --> 00:25:15,291
- Rem.
- What is it?

588
00:25:18,208 --> 00:25:19,708
- Emilia is the one I love.

589
00:25:23,416 --> 00:25:24,750
- I know.

590
00:25:24,833 --> 00:25:26,250
- I want to see Emilia smile.

591
00:25:26,333 --> 00:25:29,875
I want to be of help
to Emilia's future.

592
00:25:29,958 --> 00:25:31,916
Even if she says
I'm in the way,

593
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,791
even if she tells me
to leave her...

594
00:25:35,708 --> 00:25:38,000
I want to be right there
at her side.

595
00:25:39,791 --> 00:25:41,875
Using my feelings for her
as an excuse

596
00:25:41,958 --> 00:25:42,583
to get her
to understand everything

597
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:44,958
was pretty arrogant
of me, huh?

598
00:25:45,041 --> 00:25:46,916
Man, do I feel stupid.

599
00:25:48,958 --> 00:25:51,708
It's okay
if she doesn't understand.

600
00:25:51,791 --> 00:25:53,250
I just want to save her.

601
00:25:53,333 --> 00:25:56,250
If there's a bleak, painful
future waiting for her,

602
00:25:56,333 --> 00:25:57,541
I want to take her away

603
00:25:57,625 --> 00:25:59,541
to a future where we
can all laugh together.

604
00:26:03,125 --> 00:26:03,833
Will you help me?

605
00:26:03,916 --> 00:26:06,000
I need you.

606
00:26:06,083 --> 00:26:08,916
I can't do anything alone.

607
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,625
I'm lacking in everything.

608
00:26:10,708 --> 00:26:12,041
I'm not even sure
I can keep walking straight.

609
00:26:12,125 --> 00:26:14,166
I'm just a weakling,

610
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:16,791
so fragile and small.

611
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:20,125
I'm asking to make sure
I stay on the right path,

612
00:26:20,208 --> 00:26:21,958
to help me realize
when I'm wrong.

613
00:26:22,041 --> 00:26:23,291
Will you help me?

614

- [giggles]

615
00:26:26,958 --> 00:26:29,291
You're a cruel man.
You know that?

616
00:26:29,375 --> 00:26:31,833
You ask this of somebody
who confessed their love for you

617
00:26:31,916 --> 00:26:32,875
and then reject it?

618
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:34,833
- Hey, it's also hard
for me to ask this

619
00:26:34,916 --> 00:26:36,291
of the one who rejected
my once-in-a-lifetime proposal.

620
00:26:36,375 --> 00:26:39,125
You wanna just call it even
and move on?

- I'll be there to help
with whatever you need.

624
00:26:53,083 --> 00:26:55,083
I'll do everything
I can for you.

625
00:26:55,166 --> 00:26:58,125
If it helps my hero,

626
00:26:58,208 --> 00:27:01,333
if you greet the future with
a smile, then it's worth it.

627
00:27:01,416 --> 00:27:02,000
- Thanks, Rem.

628
00:27:02,083 --> 00:27:04,000
And now watch me.

629
00:27:04,083 --> 00:27:05,833
You get a front-row seat...

you fell in love with

00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:15,041
become the most awesome hero

You're watching me...

00:27:33,208 --> 00:27:36,708
so I won't look downward,
not anymore.

641
00:27:36,791 --> 00:27:38,208
Subaru Natsuki's story

642
00:27:38,291 --> 00:27:40,833
will begin right here
at this moment.

643
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,250
My life in another world
starts here...

644
00:27:46,333 --> 00:27:47,708
from zero!

645
00:27:51,125 --> 00:27:53,833
[wind blowing]

646
00:27:55,333 --> 00:27:56,375
- Are you serious?

647
00:27:56,458 --> 00:27:59,750
SUBARU: Yes.
You heard me correctly.

648
00:27:59,833 --> 00:28:01,083
I'm proposing an alliance

649
00:28:01,166 --> 00:28:04,000
between the Emilia and
Crusch camps on equal terms,

650
00:28:04,083 --> 00:28:07,083
and the information I'll offer
for that purpose is this,

651
00:28:07,166 --> 00:28:09,750
the next time and place
you'll find the White Whale.

652
00:28:09,833 --> 00:28:12,250
That's the one card
I can play here.

653
00:28:16,166 --> 00:28:17,416
- The White Whale?

654
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,291
[energy humming]

655
00:28:21,083 --> 00:28:22,208
- [gasps]

656
00:28:23,166 --> 00:28:24,833
- [sighs]

657
00:28:26,375 --> 00:28:28,750
Please forgive my indiscretion.

658
00:28:28,833 --> 00:28:30,916
I suppose I still
have much to learn.

659
00:28:31,041 --> 00:28:32,208
- [chuckles]

660
00:28:32,291 --> 00:28:34,791
- I must say,
it seems a bit out of nowhere

661
00:28:34,875 --> 00:28:37,125
for you to suddenly bring up
the White Whale like this.

662
00:28:37,208 --> 00:28:37,958
- Oh, I wouldn't say that.

663
00:28:38,041 --> 00:28:40,375
When we first began
this negotiation,

664
00:28:40,458 --> 00:28:43,166
I mentioned the magic stones
that were found in Elior Forest,

665
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:45,250
located inside
Lord Roswaal's domain.

666
00:28:45,333 --> 00:28:47,875
If sharing the mining rights
is an insufficient incentive

667
00:28:47,958 --> 00:28:50,125
to seal this deal,
then I suppose I'm gonna need

668
00:28:50,208 --> 00:28:51,875
to offer up an additional push.

669
00:28:51,958 --> 00:28:54,208
So listen to me.
I'm absolutely certain

670
00:28:54,291 --> 00:28:55,750
that the information
I can provide

671
00:28:55,833 --> 00:28:59,416
will help you in your plan
to bring that thing down.

672
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,250
- There's something
I'd like to ask you about

673
00:29:00,333 --> 00:29:02,333
concerning this matter.

674
00:29:02,416 --> 00:29:04,833
What made you feel
this would be enticing to me?

675
00:29:04,916 --> 00:29:06,083
Since we've never discussed it,

676
00:29:06,166 --> 00:29:08,083
this seems oddly focused
to present.

677
00:29:08,166 --> 00:29:09,416
For the past few days,

678
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,125
I've noticed a few things
that bothered me.

679
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:14,208
First, the traffic
to and from your mansion.

680
00:29:14,291 --> 00:29:16,875
It's been just a little
excessive, if you ask me.

681
00:29:16,958 --> 00:29:18,125
Also I heard in the capital

682
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:21,375
that you've been buying up a lot
of weapons and armor lately.

683
00:29:21,458 --> 00:29:22,708
Plus...

684
00:29:22,791 --> 00:29:24,916
<i>- If Miss Crusch's goal</i>
<i>were to be attained,</i>

685
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:25,833
<i>then, Mr. Wilhelm,</i>
<i>I'm confident</i>

686
00:29:25,916 --> 00:29:29,166
<i>such an outcome</i>
<i>would suit your desires.</i>

687
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:31,041
- Based on those observations,

688
00:29:31,125 --> 00:29:33,000
it seemed like you were
planning something big.

689
00:29:33,083 --> 00:29:34,166
'Course, I can't
exactly prove that, can I?

690
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:36,500
Who's to say?

691
00:29:36,583 --> 00:29:39,166
Maybe I only made the connection
because I happen to know

692
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:41,125
the White Whale
will be appearing soon.

693
00:29:41,208 --> 00:29:44,291
- I have another question,
Subaru Natsuki.

694
00:29:44,375 --> 00:29:45,833
On what grounds do you know

695
00:29:45,916 --> 00:29:48,250
when and where the White Whale
will next appear?

696
00:29:49,583 --> 00:29:50,416
- Because of this.

697
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:53,500
- And what is this contraption?

698
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:55,458
<i>- The moment</i>
<i>before that went down,</i>

699
00:29:55,541 --> 00:29:57,375
<i>I happened to notice...</i>

700
00:30:00,625 --> 00:30:04,291
That device is what
you'd call a metia.

701
00:30:04,375 --> 00:30:08,416
It tells me exactly when and
where that monster will appear.

702
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,000
- I find all this
a bit hard to believe.

703
00:30:13,458 --> 00:30:14,541
But I see that you aren't lying.

704
00:30:14,625 --> 00:30:17,333
- I appreciate you believing me,

705
00:30:17,416 --> 00:30:19,625
but I'm surprised
you did so easily.

706
00:30:19,708 --> 00:30:22,375
- Telling lies will get you
nowhere with Miss Crusch.

707
00:30:22,458 --> 00:30:24,041
She has the divine protection
of wind-reading.

708
00:30:24,125 --> 00:30:25,500
- Uh, say what?

709
00:30:25,583 --> 00:30:28,583
- Whenever anyone attempts
to tell a lie,

710
00:30:28,666 --> 00:30:30,875
there's a telling wind
that blows around them.

711
00:30:30,958 --> 00:30:31,583
I'm able to see that wind.

712
00:30:31,666 --> 00:30:34,958
There's no evidence
of it now.

713
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:36,166
- So then, does that mean

714
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:37,625
you'll agree
to an alliance in exchange

715
00:30:37,708 --> 00:30:39,541
for all the information
I have on the White Whale?

716
00:30:39,625 --> 00:30:40,250
- Not so fast.

717
00:30:40,333 --> 00:30:42,541
That's not what I said.

718
00:30:42,625 --> 00:30:45,125
Whether or not I agree to
the alliance you just proposed

719
00:30:45,208 --> 00:30:48,250
and whether or not I believe you
are entirely separate matters.

720
00:30:48,333 --> 00:30:50,000
This important decision
will determine

721
00:30:50,083 --> 00:30:51,750
not only the outcome
of the royal selection itself,

722
00:30:51,833 --> 00:30:55,125
but the entire future
of the kingdom.

723
00:30:56,333 --> 00:30:57,375
ANASTASIA: Hey, would you mind

724
00:30:57,458 --> 00:30:59,875
if I listen in
on this little chat, too?

725
00:31:01,708 --> 00:31:03,375
RUSSELL: Pardon us.

726
00:31:03,458 --> 00:31:05,083
CRUSCH: Anastasia Hoshin.

727
00:31:05,166 --> 00:31:06,458
And Russell Fellow?

728
00:31:06,541 --> 00:31:08,000
- [giggles]

729
00:31:08,083 --> 00:31:09,416
Now this isn't fair at all,
if you ask me.

730
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,583
You asked us to come,

731
00:31:11,666 --> 00:31:13,958
and then here you are
starting things without us.

732
00:31:14,041 --> 00:31:15,125
Let us in on this, too.

733
00:31:15,208 --> 00:31:17,041
- I wasn't aware
of this invitation.

734
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:19,333
Was it Subaru Natsuki
who asked you to come here?

735
00:31:19,416 --> 00:31:20,625
- Well, to be exact,

736
00:31:20,708 --> 00:31:23,250
it was this blue-haired girl
he keeps with him.

737
00:31:23,333 --> 00:31:25,458
I only heard the gist
of what you were talking about,

738
00:31:25,541 --> 00:31:28,000
but if you're really planning
on putting down the White Whale,

739
00:31:28,083 --> 00:31:29,500
I'm all about it.

740
00:31:29,583 --> 00:31:31,458
For us businessfolk,
whether that thing

741
00:31:31,541 --> 00:31:33,958
is around or not is pretty much
a life-or-death matter,

742
00:31:34,041 --> 00:31:37,041
so our mercenary team will help
with whatever you need.

743
00:31:37,125 --> 00:31:38,166
- In addition to all matters

744
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:39,708
that are concerning
the White Whale,

745
00:31:39,791 --> 00:31:41,458
I'm interested in the concession
proposed by Mr. Natsuki

746
00:31:41,541 --> 00:31:42,666
regarding the possibility

747
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:44,666
of mining rights
to the magic stones.

748
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:47,583
If the aforementioned alliance
is formed,

749
00:31:47,666 --> 00:31:50,125
magic stones mined
from veins previously untouched

750
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:53,291
will be distributed to
the capital through Miss Crusch.

751
00:31:53,375 --> 00:31:55,083
As the merchant guild's
representative,

752
00:31:55,166 --> 00:31:57,166
I cannot let this offer
go unheard.

753
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:59,583
- Natsuki called you as well?

754
00:31:59,666 --> 00:32:01,333
- I'll say it once more.

755
00:32:01,416 --> 00:32:03,333
What I offer
in return for this alliance

756
00:32:03,416 --> 00:32:05,500
is a share in the magic stone
mining rights

757
00:32:05,583 --> 00:32:07,416
and information concerning
when and where

758
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,291
the White Whale
will next appear.

759
00:32:08,375 --> 00:32:09,666
You'd have everything
you need to locate

760
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:12,666
and attack
that terrorizing mabeast

761
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:15,416
and then bring it down.

762
00:32:17,041 --> 00:32:19,250
If what I've said doesn't
have any appeal for you,

763
00:32:19,333 --> 00:32:21,208
then forget I mentioned
anything about it.

764
00:32:21,291 --> 00:32:22,500
On the other hand,
if your goal and my wish

765
00:32:22,583 --> 00:32:25,541
align the way I think they do,

766
00:32:25,625 --> 00:32:27,250
then let's defeat
the White Whale.

767
00:32:29,125 --> 00:32:31,291
Let's go on a hunt together.

768
00:32:31,375 --> 00:32:33,000
[no audible dialogue]

769
00:32:34,416 --> 00:32:35,750
[swallows]

770
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:41,291
- [sighs]

771
00:32:41,375 --> 00:32:44,291
I still have several questions
concerning this arrangement,

772
00:32:44,375 --> 00:32:46,291
but it was brilliant of you
to uncover my plans.

773
00:32:46,375 --> 00:32:47,625
- So then...

774
00:32:47,708 --> 00:32:51,166
- I have questions,
as well as doubts.

775
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:53,041
Some things you've said
are unclear to me,

776
00:32:53,125 --> 00:32:55,333
so I'm having difficulty
agreeing immediately.

777
00:32:55,416 --> 00:32:57,958
However, I will choose
to trust your eyes

778
00:32:58,041 --> 00:33:00,125
and the spirit that led you
to create this situation.

779
00:33:03,541 --> 00:33:05,666
- I would say
that the deal is made, then.

780
00:33:07,625 --> 00:33:08,958
- [sighs]

781
00:33:09,041 --> 00:33:11,041
RUSSELL: There may have been
a few touch-and-go moments,

782
00:33:11,125 --> 00:33:13,083
but I'm glad it worked out,
Mr. Natsuki.

783
00:33:13,166 --> 00:33:14,708
I trust the promise
we made earlier still stands?

784
00:33:14,791 --> 00:33:16,750
- Yeah, you bet.
You were a big help.

785
00:33:16,833 --> 00:33:19,416
Once the Whale
has been taken care of,

786
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,208
I'll hand over the metia to you.

787
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:25,291
- [sighs] Looks like you
laid some groundwork beforehand.

788
00:33:25,375 --> 00:33:26,583
Were you waiting
outside the door

789
00:33:26,666 --> 00:33:28,083
for your moment to enter?

790
00:33:28,166 --> 00:33:30,583
- Yes, but it was entirely
up to us when we interrupted.

791
00:33:30,666 --> 00:33:33,250
Well, far as negotiations go,

792
00:33:33,333 --> 00:33:35,208
I guess that barely gets
a passing mark.

793
00:33:35,291 --> 00:33:36,333
- Took you long enough.

794
00:33:36,416 --> 00:33:37,125
What were you doing out there?

795
00:33:37,208 --> 00:33:39,333
I thought you were
never gonna come in.

796
00:33:39,416 --> 00:33:41,458
- When negotiating,
there's always a perfect time

797
00:33:41,541 --> 00:33:42,750
to make your move.

798
00:33:42,833 --> 00:33:44,750
Right. Well,
as you're getting ready

799
00:33:44,833 --> 00:33:46,458
for the subjugation and such,

800
00:33:46,541 --> 00:33:48,833
don't forget to patronize
the Hoshin Company.

801
00:33:50,125 --> 00:33:50,708
- You paved the way
for everything

802
00:33:50,791 --> 00:33:53,708
before negotiations began, huh?

803
00:33:53,791 --> 00:33:56,125
You're surprisingly shrewd
in your tactics.

804
00:33:56,208 --> 00:33:57,458
I commend you.

805
00:33:57,541 --> 00:34:00,416
- My review and preparation
paid off. That's all.

806
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,916
To be honest,
I couldn't be more relieved.

807
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,541
- You can say that again.
You look completely worn out.

808
00:34:05,625 --> 00:34:06,583
- [sighs]
- [laughs]

809
00:34:06,666 --> 00:34:08,416
[Rem laughs]

810
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,708
- Well, Rem, we somehow
managed to save face

811
00:34:10,791 --> 00:34:12,458
for staying in the capital,
right?

812
00:34:12,541 --> 00:34:16,041
- Indeed. Once again, you were
truly wonderful, Subaru.

813
00:34:16,625 --> 00:34:18,666
<i>The Witch's Cult?</i>

814
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:20,291
<i>- Yeah. They're on the move</i>

815
00:34:20,375 --> 00:34:22,208
<i>and have got their eyes</i>
<i>on Emilia.</i>

816
00:34:22,291 --> 00:34:25,375
<i>- Coincidentally,</i>
<i>Lord Roswaal had a feeling</i>

817
00:34:25,458 --> 00:34:26,625
<i>like something like this</i>
<i>might happen as well.</i>

818
00:34:26,708 --> 00:34:28,958
<i>- I want to stop them,</i>

819
00:34:29,041 --> 00:34:31,333
<i>but I just don't have</i>
<i>the fighting strength to do it.</i>

820
00:34:31,416 --> 00:34:32,625
<i>I have to start negotiating</i>

821
00:34:32,708 --> 00:34:34,166
<i>if I hope</i>
<i>to pull some together.</i>

822
00:34:35,416 --> 00:34:37,833
<i>You think</i>
<i>you'll be able to help me?</i>

823
00:34:37,916 --> 00:34:38,916
- [chuckles]

824
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,750
- Mr. Subaru.
- Eh?

825
00:34:46,583 --> 00:34:47,916
- I must thank you.

826
00:34:48,875 --> 00:34:50,791
- Huh?
- You have my deepest respect

827
00:34:50,875 --> 00:34:53,500
and most humble gratitude
equal to that

828
00:34:53,583 --> 00:34:56,458
which I offer to My Lady
Duchess Crusch Karsten.

829
00:34:56,541 --> 00:34:58,458
- Oh. Well, that's, uh...

830
00:34:58,541 --> 00:35:01,375
- As perceptive as you are,
I'm sure you're aware,

831
00:35:01,458 --> 00:35:03,416
but if I may introduce myself,

832
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:06,250
my family name is Astrea.

833
00:35:06,333 --> 00:35:08,250
I took the previous
Master Swordsman,

834
00:35:08,333 --> 00:35:10,833
Theresia van Astrea as my wife,
which in turn gave me the honor

835
00:35:10,916 --> 00:35:13,666
of the lowest seat
in the bloodline.

836
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:17,250
That is who I,
Wilhelm van Astrea, proudly am.

837
00:35:19,291 --> 00:35:20,708
Thank you for so very kindly

838
00:35:20,791 --> 00:35:22,500
granting this old man
the opportunity

839
00:35:22,583 --> 00:35:25,833
to slay the loathsome mabeast
that took my wife.

840
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:29,375
- Uh, sure. Of course.

841
00:35:29,458 --> 00:35:30,583
I knew that. No big deal.

842
00:35:30,666 --> 00:35:33,208
I figured Miss Crusch
would weigh that into account

843
00:35:33,291 --> 00:35:34,750
and accept my offer
with that in mind.

844
00:35:34,833 --> 00:35:36,208
- Subaru Natsuki,

845
00:35:36,291 --> 00:35:39,750
the wind of untruth
is blowing from you.

846
00:35:39,833 --> 00:35:41,833
[overlapping chatter]

847
00:35:49,708 --> 00:35:51,875
SUBARU:<i> I get it now.</i>

848
00:35:51,958 --> 00:35:53,875
<i>You bought all the dragon-drawn</i>
<i>carriages for this,</i>

849
00:35:53,958 --> 00:35:55,875
<i>and that's why I had trouble</i>

850
00:35:55,958 --> 00:35:56,791
<i>getting a ride</i>
<i>back to the mansion.</i>

851
00:35:56,875 --> 00:35:59,125
- You're still awake, huh?

852
00:35:59,208 --> 00:36:00,083
- No way I could sleep
through all this.

853
00:36:00,166 --> 00:36:03,250
Everyone else here
is working through the night.

854
00:36:03,333 --> 00:36:04,750
- They have neo choice.
We don't have much time neow.

855
00:36:04,833 --> 00:36:07,291
- That's true. The White Whale's

856
00:36:07,375 --> 00:36:09,083
next appearance
will be tomorrow night

857
00:36:09,166 --> 00:36:11,166
in the area that's
right around Flügel's Tree.

858
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:13,250
- Given all the traveling
it takes to get there,

859
00:36:13,333 --> 00:36:14,416
we'll just barely make it.

860
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:17,541
Besides, can't you see it
in all of their faces?

861
00:36:17,625 --> 00:36:19,208
- [gasps]
- [laughter]

862
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,833
FELIX: Not a single one of them
is preparing unwillingly.

863
00:36:22,916 --> 00:36:25,458
Everyone in the entire kingdom

864
00:36:25,541 --> 00:36:27,375
wants to be rid
of the White Whale,

865
00:36:27,458 --> 00:36:28,333
especially old man Wil
over there.

866
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,500
- He said it took his wife.

867
00:36:33,583 --> 00:36:35,291
- Hmm.

868
00:36:35,375 --> 00:36:36,916
Since before you were born,

869
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:37,916
he's been chasing
after that awful thing.

870
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,250
His wife was
the Master Swordsman.

871
00:36:41,333 --> 00:36:43,375
Even knowing
what her duties entailed,

872
00:36:43,458 --> 00:36:45,250
her death was no less tragic.

873
00:36:45,333 --> 00:36:46,833
- The previous Master Swordsman.

874
00:36:46,916 --> 00:36:48,666
- Well, now you know the story.

875
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:50,375
You should stop
worrying about things

876
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:51,666
and try to get some sleep.

877
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:53,375
Besides, there's
nothing you can do

878
00:36:53,458 --> 00:36:54,791
to help with supply distribution

879
00:36:54,875 --> 00:36:57,041
or organization
of this mission anyway.

880
00:36:57,125 --> 00:36:59,375
- That may be true,
but you didn't have to say it

881
00:36:59,458 --> 00:37:00,458
and rub it in my face!

882
00:37:00,541 --> 00:37:03,833
- [laughs]

883
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:09,250
[wind blowing]

884
00:37:10,875 --> 00:37:14,541
SUBARU: So I'm supposed
to pick whichever one I want?

885
00:37:14,625 --> 00:37:15,458
- What are you
complaining about neow?

886
00:37:15,541 --> 00:37:17,666
- Don't you like 'em?
- It's not that.

887
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:19,375
I'm glad you're
letting me borrow one,

888
00:37:19,458 --> 00:37:20,166
but I don't
know enough about 'em

889
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:22,958
to figure out
what I'm looking for.

890
00:37:23,041 --> 00:37:25,625
I mean, do I look like a guy
who studied ground dragons

891
00:37:25,708 --> 00:37:27,291
for decades or something? Wait.

892
00:37:31,041 --> 00:37:34,083
Are you
the same one from before?

893
00:37:36,916 --> 00:37:37,875
- [grunts]

894
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:42,541
- [laughs] Well, it looks
like this is the one for me.

895
00:37:42,625 --> 00:37:43,833
- Wow. I'm surprised.

896
00:37:43,916 --> 00:37:45,083
This type of ground dragon

897
00:37:45,166 --> 00:37:47,916
is known for being
really proud and difficult,

898
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,916
yet it took to him right away.

899
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,500
- Felix, I'll take this one.

900
00:37:51,583 --> 00:37:52,750
It's love at first sight.

901
00:37:52,833 --> 00:37:53,541
- That's fine by me.

902
00:37:53,625 --> 00:37:55,750
But don't say,
"Love at first sight."

903
00:37:55,833 --> 00:37:56,958
You're making little Rem
pouty-wouty.

904
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:58,916
- I'm not
pouty-whatever you said.

905
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,833
I'll be nice to it. I promise.

906
00:38:00,916 --> 00:38:02,875
- I can do it.
- [grunts]

907
00:38:02,958 --> 00:38:04,416
- [crackling]
- [Rem groans]

908
00:38:07,125 --> 00:38:09,125
[overlapping chatter]

909
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:15,791
- [grunts] Hey!

910
00:38:15,875 --> 00:38:17,500
- My Lady was telling me
about you.

911
00:38:17,583 --> 00:38:21,375
I believe you're the star
of this little show, aren't you?

912
00:38:21,458 --> 00:38:24,875
<i>- That logo.</i>
<i>A demihuman from Kararagi?</i>

913
00:38:24,958 --> 00:38:25,916
So I take it
you're with Anastasia?

914
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,791
- Sure am. What gave it away?

915
00:38:28,875 --> 00:38:31,791
I'm Ricardo,
head of her mercenary team.

916
00:38:31,875 --> 00:38:34,500
It is nice to meet you,
too, little lady.

917
00:38:34,583 --> 00:38:36,041
- Keep it down. Also be careful.

918
00:38:36,125 --> 00:38:37,708
You're huge.
You'll snap my neck.

919
00:38:37,791 --> 00:38:39,541
- Hey, My Lady!

920
00:38:39,625 --> 00:38:41,166
- Easy! [groans]

921
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:42,166
Holy crap.

922
00:38:43,625 --> 00:38:44,625
CRUSCH: Must be the pride

923
00:38:44,708 --> 00:38:47,458
of Anastasia and the Hoshins,
the Iron Fang.

924
00:38:47,541 --> 00:38:50,541
Impressive. They all do
look rather formidable.

925
00:38:50,625 --> 00:38:51,375
So did you sleep well
last night?

926
00:38:51,458 --> 00:38:53,750
- Yeah, but I nearly died
a second ago.

927
00:38:53,833 --> 00:38:56,416
Oh. Judging by your outfit,

928
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,750
I guess you're fighting,
too, then?

929
00:38:57,833 --> 00:39:00,208
- Well, of course I am.
Do you really think I'm capable

930
00:39:00,291 --> 00:39:02,541
of just sitting in a chair
and waiting for good news?

931
00:39:02,625 --> 00:39:04,250
To be honest, I'm more surprised
that you're participating.

932
00:39:04,333 --> 00:39:07,416
Are you skilled
in the art of combat?

933
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:08,583
- That would be a no.

934
00:39:08,666 --> 00:39:10,916
But even if I can't fight,
let me tell you,

935
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,416
someone here's
gonna come in pretty handy

936
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:14,083
in this battle
against the White Whale,

937
00:39:14,166 --> 00:39:16,625
- and that's me.
- Really?

938
00:39:16,708 --> 00:39:17,416
What makes you say that?

939
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,791
- Well, it's not
exactly something

940
00:39:19,875 --> 00:39:20,791
I'm really happy about, but...

941
00:39:20,875 --> 00:39:22,708
I seem to be the type of guy
that attracts mabeasts

942
00:39:22,791 --> 00:39:24,916
like moths to a flame.

943
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,125
- Seriously? [gasps]

944
00:39:27,208 --> 00:39:28,916
- It's the truth.

945
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,083
In fact, Subaru has
saved my life before

946
00:39:31,166 --> 00:39:32,666
thanks to that very ability.

947
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:35,583
- So I figured I'd run around
under the White Whale's nose

948
00:39:35,666 --> 00:39:38,041
on my borrowed ground dragon
and draw its attention

949
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:40,958
while the rest of you ride in
and launch an all-out attack.

950
00:39:41,041 --> 00:39:43,625
Eh, at least that's the tactic
I'd recommend, anyway.

951
00:39:43,708 --> 00:39:46,708
- So you'd risk your life
to be the bait?

[sighs] Shockingly,

953
00:39:49,625 --> 00:39:51,958
I don't sense any lies
in that idiotic statement.

954
00:39:52,041 --> 00:39:54,000
Never thought I'd doubt
my divine protection

955
00:39:54,083 --> 00:39:56,000
as often as I have
in the past half-day,

956
00:39:56,083 --> 00:39:58,000
but this is a unique
set of circumstances.

[Crusch and Rem gasp]

959
00:40:03,125 --> 00:40:04,250
- They've arrived.

960
00:40:07,541 --> 00:40:08,291
- Greetings, Miss Crusch.

961
00:40:08,375 --> 00:40:12,000
Reporting as ordered
under your command.

962
00:40:13,208 --> 00:40:14,916
Is this the boy?

963
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,666
- Yes, the very same.

964
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:20,000
- [gasps]
- You have my gratitude.

965
00:40:20,083 --> 00:40:22,583
- Huh?
- Because of you,

966
00:40:22,666 --> 00:40:24,916
our greatest wish
may come true,

967
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,125
and we couldn't
be happier about it.

968
00:40:27,208 --> 00:40:28,625
I thank you.

969
00:40:28,708 --> 00:40:30,541
- Uh...

970
00:40:30,625 --> 00:40:31,666
- [chuckles]

971
00:40:36,666 --> 00:40:38,083
REM: It's seems
they're all people

972
00:40:38,166 --> 00:40:40,166
who have a history
with the White Whale.

973
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:43,875
- Those soldiers, are they all
just like Wilhelm, then?

974
00:40:43,958 --> 00:40:45,833
- Indeed. Many of them are men

975
00:40:45,916 --> 00:40:47,583
who have since retired from
fighting on the front lines.

976
00:40:47,666 --> 00:40:51,125
They've donned their armor
and joined our subjugation force

977
00:40:51,208 --> 00:40:52,916
at Wilhelm's invitation.

978
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,625
Their experience is comparable

979
00:40:54,708 --> 00:40:56,541
to those of the capital's
active knights.

980
00:40:56,625 --> 00:40:59,041
- The time has come,
Miss Crusch.

981
00:40:59,125 --> 00:41:00,000
- Right.

982
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:02,083
[no audible dialogue]

983
00:41:05,958 --> 00:41:07,333
400 years...

984
00:41:07,416 --> 00:41:10,708
since the White Whale
created by the jealous Witch

985
00:41:10,791 --> 00:41:12,916
made the world
its hunting ground,

986
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,041
trampling the weak
and dominating the land

987
00:41:15,125 --> 00:41:15,875
as if it were its owner.

988
00:41:15,958 --> 00:41:18,708
400 years have passed.

989
00:41:18,791 --> 00:41:23,125
Countless lives have been lost
to the beast during that time.

990
00:41:23,208 --> 00:41:25,708
Given the unscrupulous nature
of its fog,

991
00:41:25,791 --> 00:41:27,833
the number of graves we cannot
even inscribe with names

992
00:41:27,916 --> 00:41:30,583
will only rise.

993
00:41:30,666 --> 00:41:31,541
- [grunts]

994
00:41:31,625 --> 00:41:32,125
- But the days of helplessness

995
00:41:32,208 --> 00:41:34,875
and sitting idle end today!

996
00:41:34,958 --> 00:41:37,875
Those of us gathered here
will end it.

997
00:41:37,958 --> 00:41:39,541
We will strike down
the White Whale

998
00:41:39,625 --> 00:41:41,208
and stop any further tragedy.

999

- [weeping]

1000
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:45,125
- We will give the despair
that fell short of true sorrow

1001
00:41:45,208 --> 00:41:47,958
a chance to shed
long overdue tears!

1002
00:41:49,083 --> 00:41:50,125
We move out!

1003
00:41:50,208 --> 00:41:54,583
Our destination is Flügel's Tree
on the Lifaus Highway!

1004
00:41:54,666 --> 00:41:56,750
Tonight, we slay
the White Whale

1005
00:41:56,833 --> 00:41:57,708
with our own hands!

1006
00:41:58,208 --> 00:42:00,916
- [cheering]
- Yeah!

[steeds galloping]

- [gasps]

1009
00:42:07,166 --> 00:42:08,833
- Hey there! I'm Mimi!

1010
00:42:08,916 --> 00:42:10,750
- Glad to know you!
- I'm Hetaro.

1011
00:42:10,833 --> 00:42:12,291
It's nice to make
your acquaintance.

1012
00:42:12,375 --> 00:42:13,875
- Yeah. Nice to meet you.

1013
00:42:13,958 --> 00:42:17,625
Anyway, not that I had any
reason to doubt it, but, uh,

1014
00:42:17,708 --> 00:42:19,083
you really are the
second-in-command, aren't you?

1015
00:42:19,166 --> 00:42:21,916
- Hmm? Wait a second.

1016
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,833
Have we met somewhere before?

1017
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:25,083
I'm thinking about it,

1018
00:42:25,166 --> 00:42:27,250
but I totally don't remember
seeing your face at all.

1019
00:42:27,333 --> 00:42:28,541
- Hey, come on, Sister.

1020
00:42:28,625 --> 00:42:29,125
- You have to sit up properly.
- So weird.

1021
00:42:29,208 --> 00:42:30,416
I totally don't remember.

1022
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:33,791
- Don't worry about it.
Just talking to myself.

1023
00:42:33,875 --> 00:42:35,125
I'm Subaru Natsuki.

1024
00:42:35,208 --> 00:42:36,625
From the resemblance,
I guess you two

1025
00:42:36,708 --> 00:42:37,708
are brother and sister, huh?

1026
00:42:37,791 --> 00:42:39,958
- Yes. My big sister and I
will do our best--

1027
00:42:40,041 --> 00:42:42,125
- Mimi and Hetaro
are the strongest!

1028
00:42:42,208 --> 00:42:42,958
The captain's here, too,

1029
00:42:43,041 --> 00:42:44,458
so we're the super strongest!
[laughs]

1030
00:42:44,541 --> 00:42:47,958
- Honestly, my sister
and the captain

1031
00:42:48,041 --> 00:42:49,958
tend to be hasty with decisions,

1032
00:42:50,041 --> 00:42:52,000
so I'm the one
who usually gives the orders.

1033
00:42:52,083 --> 00:42:53,833
- I see.

1034
00:42:53,916 --> 00:42:55,291
I don't envy that at all.

1035
00:42:55,375 --> 00:42:56,833
RICARDO: What's the matter, bro?

1036
00:42:56,916 --> 00:42:57,416
You're looking kind of gloomy.

1037
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:58,833
- And whose fault is that?

1038
00:42:58,916 --> 00:43:02,125
The captain shouldn't go around
making trouble for his men.

1039
00:43:02,208 --> 00:43:03,750
- Hey, that's a nice
ground dragon you got there.

1040
00:43:03,833 --> 00:43:05,875
- Yeah!

1041
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,916
Thanks for saying so.

1042
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,625
But honestly,
I only borrowed this one

1043
00:43:09,708 --> 00:43:11,541
because it kind of
seemed to like me.

1044
00:43:11,625 --> 00:43:13,041
Come to think of it,
the ones you guys are riding

1045
00:43:13,125 --> 00:43:15,000
look pretty different.

1046
00:43:15,083 --> 00:43:16,458
- They're called rigers.

1047
00:43:16,541 --> 00:43:19,250
I guess you don't see 'em
too often around here, though.

1048
00:43:19,333 --> 00:43:20,250
They aren't as strong
as those ground dragons,

1049
00:43:20,333 --> 00:43:22,958
but they're much more lively.

1050
00:43:23,041 --> 00:43:25,208
If it comes to a brawl
against the Whale,

1051
00:43:25,291 --> 00:43:26,750
that's where they really shine,
so watch closely.

1052
00:43:26,833 --> 00:43:28,916
- [laughs]

1053
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,208
Well, if that's the case,
shouldn't you have had

1054
00:43:30,291 --> 00:43:33,250
ground dragons
pull the cargo, then?

1055
00:43:33,333 --> 00:43:34,916
- I hear what you're saying,

1056
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,875
but we gotta manage
our luggage on our own.

1057
00:43:36,958 --> 00:43:39,833
If you think the White Whale's
our only enemy,

1058
00:43:39,916 --> 00:43:41,916
you'll get the rug
pulled out from under you.

1059

- [gasps]
- [chant echoes]

1060
00:43:44,083 --> 00:43:45,833
RICARDO: After all,
there's no guarantee

1061
00:43:45,916 --> 00:43:47,833
we won't run into thieves
on the road.

1062
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:49,041
- If anybody's got the guts

1063
00:43:49,125 --> 00:43:50,875
to take on a fully armed group
like this,

1064
00:43:50,958 --> 00:43:52,875
they wouldn't settle
for being thieves.

1065
00:43:52,958 --> 00:43:53,875
- You got a point there.

1066
00:43:53,958 --> 00:43:56,750
[laughs]

1067
00:43:59,875 --> 00:44:01,208
[no audible dialogue]

1068
00:44:01,291 --> 00:44:04,041
- It looks like Mr. Ricardo
is doing his best

1069
00:44:04,125 --> 00:44:06,750
to try and ease everybody's
nerves a little bit.

1070
00:44:06,833 --> 00:44:08,000
Hey, what's wrong?

1071
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:10,833
- [sighs]

1072
00:44:10,916 --> 00:44:13,041
I thought I'd fully prepared
myself for this, but...

1073
00:44:13,125 --> 00:44:15,875
I want to be heroic.

1074
00:44:15,958 --> 00:44:17,708
'Course wanting something
and making it happen

1075
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:19,375
are two different things
entirely.

1076

SUBARU: Whoa. It's huge.

1079
00:44:37,125 --> 00:44:38,416
- It's impressive, isn't it?

1080
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:38,916
You sound happy.

1081

[sighs]

00:44:43,291 --> 00:44:46,416
Oh, man. Check this out.

1084
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:48,833
Looks like people have carved
their names into the trunk.

1085
00:44:48,916 --> 00:44:51,875
We're not on some field trip.
That's just bad manners.

1086
00:44:51,958 --> 00:44:53,250
Hey, Rem, give me a chisel.

1087
00:44:53,333 --> 00:44:54,916
- Even you
should know doing that

1088
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,833
will get you
in big trouble, Subaru,

1089
00:44:56,916 --> 00:44:58,208
with me, for starters.

1090
00:44:58,958 --> 00:45:00,416
So the White Whale
is coming here?

1091
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:03,375
Honestly, I'm opposed to using

1092
00:45:03,458 --> 00:45:05,291
the Witch's scent
to draw it here.

1093
00:45:05,375 --> 00:45:07,916
It's much too dangerous.

1094
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,083
It worries me.

1095
00:45:09,166 --> 00:45:11,250
- I'll use whatever I can
to stop it.

1096
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:12,708
[grunts]

1097
00:45:12,791 --> 00:45:14,291
I mean, if it gives us
even a slightly better chance

1098
00:45:14,375 --> 00:45:16,416
of winning, it's worth it.

1099
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:17,791
For a guy who's lacking

1100
00:45:17,875 --> 00:45:19,291
in pretty much
every way imaginable,

1101
00:45:19,375 --> 00:45:22,875
this is the only way
I can pitch in and compensate.

1102
00:45:22,958 --> 00:45:25,375
- You're so wonderful, Subaru.

1103
00:45:25,458 --> 00:45:26,416
- [chuckles]

1104
00:45:28,916 --> 00:45:32,875
- So that metia will tell you
when the White Whale is coming?

1105
00:45:32,958 --> 00:45:36,291
- Yeah. I set it
to make noise when it's time.

1106
00:45:36,375 --> 00:45:38,125
And to be honest, without this--

1107
00:45:38,208 --> 00:45:38,875
- That's a lie.
- [gasps]

1108
00:45:41,166 --> 00:45:42,875
What--Hold on!
What are you saying?

1109
00:45:42,958 --> 00:45:44,416
If it's a lie, then how am I

1110
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:46,000
gonna help catch
that White Whale in the...

1111
00:45:46,083 --> 00:45:46,625
- It sounds as if
you're speaking

1112
00:45:46,708 --> 00:45:48,458
like someone from Kararagi.

1113
00:45:48,541 --> 00:45:49,875
It doesn't suit you at all.

1114
00:45:49,958 --> 00:45:50,708
- No, no, no, no!
I mean, there's no way

1115
00:45:50,791 --> 00:45:53,083
I could be lying!
Even Miss Crusch said

1116
00:45:53,166 --> 00:45:55,000
I didn't have the wind thing
blowing around me...

1117
00:45:55,083 --> 00:45:56,208
- It's all an act, Subaru.

1118
00:45:56,291 --> 00:45:58,291
I can always tell
when you're lying,

1119
00:45:58,375 --> 00:46:00,125
with or without the power
to see the telltale wind.

1120
00:46:00,208 --> 00:46:03,125
I also know every time

1121
00:46:03,208 --> 00:46:05,416
that you can't tell me
why you're lying,

1122
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:07,708
so there's no need for you
to try to convince me

1123
00:46:07,791 --> 00:46:09,750
to believe whatever excuse
you're coming up with

1124
00:46:09,833 --> 00:46:11,541
or wrap everything
you're saying in lies

1125
00:46:11,625 --> 00:46:14,125
or try to take the blame
upon yourself like that.

1126
00:46:15,333 --> 00:46:17,958
It's not necessary,

1127
00:46:18,041 --> 00:46:20,833
because I have absolute faith
in you, Subaru.

Man, looking up
at this huge tree

1132
00:46:30,583 --> 00:46:32,875
really gets you fired up,
doesn't it, Rem?

1133
00:46:32,958 --> 00:46:34,666
- Yes. It certainly does.

1134
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:37,875
- I don't think
that I'll be able to relax

1135
00:46:37,958 --> 00:46:40,083
if I don't look up at it
for a long time.

1136
00:46:40,166 --> 00:46:41,375
I won't be able to look
anywhere else for a while.

1137
00:46:41,458 --> 00:46:44,375
- Yes, I understand.

1138
00:46:48,125 --> 00:46:50,375
- Should say thanks
instead of I'm sorry

1139
00:46:50,458 --> 00:46:52,375
in these situations.

1140
00:46:53,375 --> 00:46:55,000
- Well, in that case,

1141
00:46:55,083 --> 00:46:56,375
you're welcome.

1142
00:46:56,458 --> 00:46:59,458
Besides, if I look back on
all that's happened between us,

1143
00:46:59,541 --> 00:47:01,208
I'm far more grateful
to you, Subaru,

1144
00:47:01,291 --> 00:47:03,208
so we're even.

Uh, Wilhelm.

1148
00:47:19,125 --> 00:47:22,208
I heard a little bit
of the story from Felix,

1149
00:47:22,291 --> 00:47:24,333
that you've been seeking revenge
on the White Whale

1150
00:47:24,416 --> 00:47:27,041
ever since it took
your wife away from you.

1151
00:47:27,125 --> 00:47:29,208
- Please forget that.

1152
00:47:29,291 --> 00:47:33,083
It was all time idly spent
in an old man's delusions.

1153
00:47:33,166 --> 00:47:36,208
- You truly love your wife
with all your heart, don't you?

1154
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,166
- Yes. I love her
more than anything,

1155
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:42,416
more than anyone,

1156
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:44,875
no matter how much time
passes without her.

1157
00:47:46,666 --> 00:47:48,250
My wife was a woman
who loved to make the time

1158
00:47:48,333 --> 00:47:50,333
to look at flowers.

1159
00:47:51,208 --> 00:47:54,000
She never wished
she had to carry a sword,

1160
00:47:54,083 --> 00:47:57,375
but the sword she wielded
loved her more than anyone.

1161
00:47:57,458 --> 00:48:00,041
With no choice
but to live for that weapon,

1162
00:48:00,125 --> 00:48:03,750
my wife gave in to her destiny
and accepted her fate.

1163
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:07,625
When I married her,
I made a decision,

1164
00:48:07,708 --> 00:48:10,375
she would abandon
the title of Master Swordsman.

1165
00:48:10,458 --> 00:48:12,583
I tried to take that life away,

1166
00:48:12,666 --> 00:48:14,750
but the sword
wouldn't allow her to do it.

1167
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:21,291
Mr. Subaru, I thank you again.

1168
00:48:21,375 --> 00:48:22,416
In the battle before us,

1169
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:26,041
I needn't look any further
than my own sword for answers.

1170
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:29,416
And perhaps I will finally

1171
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:31,916
be able to visit
my wife's grave.

1172
00:48:33,416 --> 00:48:35,458
At last I can stand
before her once again.

1173
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:42,291
- Let's do everything we can
and work together

1174
00:48:42,375 --> 00:48:44,458
to beat the hell
out of that damn Whale.

1175
00:48:44,541 --> 00:48:46,666
I promise to give it
everything I've got.
