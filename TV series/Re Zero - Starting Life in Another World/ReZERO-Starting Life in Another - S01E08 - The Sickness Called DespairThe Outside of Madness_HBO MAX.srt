00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:44,875
That goes both ways, Emilia.

163
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:46,958
[music playing]

164
00:07:57,958 --> 00:08:00,291
[music playing only]

165
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,250
[music ends]

00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:08,125
[footsteps pattering]

167
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:11,833
Hmm?

168
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:13,541
- Subaru Natsuki,

169
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:14,833
would you mind
joining me for a bit?

170
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:17,041
- Miss Crusch, right?

171
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:19,250
- Yes, that's right.

172
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,583
Oh, of course.

173
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:23,625
This is probably
the first time you've seen me

174
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:25,750
out of my business attire,
isn't it?

175
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:27,708
The breeze
is pleasantly cool tonight,

176
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:29,083
perfect conditions
for sharing a drink

177
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:32,791
as we gaze out
upon the night sky.

178
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:38,083
- Uh, I'm too young
to drink alcohol.

179
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:39,666
- You're welcome
to have some water, then.

180
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:43,291
Don't worry. I won't be
drinking
enough to get drunk tonight.

181
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:45,333
[ice clinking]

182
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:50,708
- [sighs]

183
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:57,208
- Tell me,
how's the healing of your gate?

184
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:58,875
- Huh?

185
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:00,208
<i>- Neow, neow.</i>
<i>- Hey!</i>

186
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:01,833
Oh. [chuckles]

187
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:05,291
I guess not too bad.

188
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:06,166
- Hmm.

189
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:09,041
Well, Felix is excellent
with healing magic.

190
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:10,958
You can put your trust in him.

191
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:16,125
- What about you?

192
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:17,000
You seem to be
pretty busy lately.

193
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:19,125
- Yes, indeed.

194
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:21,583
My family's currently
gathering people and supplies

195
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:22,500
in response
to a certain occurrence.

196
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:26,541
Also, since word
of the royal selection spread,

197
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:28,791
I've received proposals
every day now.

198
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:30,583
I'm sure the other candidates
have as well.

199
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:32,791
- [spits]
Did you say, "Proposals"?

200
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:34,958
You mean as in marriage?!

201
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,250
Oh, yeah.

202
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:38,208
I guess they're all single,
aren't they?

203
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:38,958
- Does that bother you?

204
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:41,666
- Uh, not really.

205
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:42,875
It's just--

206
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:44,958
Oh, wait. That's right.

207
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:46,250
I remember
Mr. Wilhelm telling me

208
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:48,083
that he had a beautiful wife.

209
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,291
- Are you aware of why
he's acting as my servant?

210
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:53,000
Seems rather curious to me.

211
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:56,041
- Huh? Why is that?

212
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:57,458
- [squeal]

213
00:09:57,541 --> 00:10:00,333
What are you doing out here
with Miss Crusch, Subaru?!

214
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:01,333
And, Miss Crusch,

215
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:04,125
why are you dressed
so vulnerably?

216
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:06,833
- Is it strange?
I mean, it's no different

217
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:08,708
from what I wear
when I dine with you.

218
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:09,750
- Well, yes, I know.

219
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:10,666
That's exactly the problem.

220
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,625
'Cause men are nothing
but wolves, Miss!

221
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:14,458
- Don't forget.
You're a man, too.

222
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:18,000
- That's enough joking around,
Felix.

223
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:20,791
Everyone who was present
at the royal selection

224
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:23,166
knows whom Subaru
has real feelings for.

225
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,666
- Yeah, that's true.

226
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,041
I heard they had
a big fight, though.

227
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,833
- [grumbles]
- Aww!

228
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:29,208
Don't be mad, Subaru.

229
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:31,375
You're so easy to read.

230
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:32,166
- [sighs]

231
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,666
- Don't cast your gaze down,
Subaru.

232
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,875
- Huh?
- When your eyes are clouded,

233
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:39,416
your soul darkens,
your future is closed,

234
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,375
and you lose sight
of your reasons to live.

235
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:45,375
When you do
what you know to be right,

236
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:49,041
what is it you possibly hope
to achieve by looking downward.

237
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:52,750
Lift your head, face forward,
and reach out.

238
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:53,583
It is not in my preferred stance

239
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:57,208
to regard you
as an insignificant enemy.

240
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:59,958
- If Miss Crusch says so,

241
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:02,000
you have neo choice
in the matter.

242
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:03,708
The point is, Subaru,

243
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:06,750
you need to hurry up
and make up with Miss Emilia.

244
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,416
So think about how
you accomplish that, and do it!

245
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,458
Seriously,
it's as simple as that.

246
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:17,125
<i>- How I can accomplish that,</i>
<i>huh?</i>

247
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:24,000
There is something,
and only I can do it.

248
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,958
- Huh?
- Oh?

249
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:27,500
[no audible dialogue]

250
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:29,333
- [sighs]

251
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:32,250
Yeah, I know
that's what needs to happen.

252
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:34,333
It's so clear to me now.

253
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:36,208
You don't even
have to tell me a thing.

254
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:40,083
- Hmm.
- [wind blowing]

255
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:43,416
The wind is picking up.

256
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,833
From the looks of things,

257
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:47,833
I'd say the weather
will be rough again tomorrow.

258
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:54,333
[wood clatters]

259
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:59,208
- What do you say, young man?
Shall we stop for now?

260
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:00,291
- Come on. You kidding me?

261
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:02,375
You've seen how far I've come

262
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:04,375
taking blows
and rolling with it, right?

263
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:05,583
- Your attitude
seems quite different.

264
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:08,333
I'm sensing a change in you
this morning.

265
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:10,708
- It's possible,
'cause Miss Crusch

266
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:12,791
gave me some much-needed advice
last night.

267
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:14,791
<i>If I just get a chance,</i>

268
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:18,041
<i>I can make</i>
<i>any problem I have go away.</i>

269
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:21,000
- Hmm. I see.

270
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:23,416
I must suggest
that we call it a day.

271
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,416
- Eh?

272
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,500
- Well, in my opinion,

273
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:27,416
it's become rather meaningless.

274
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,750
Why bother teaching someone

275
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:30,666
who's abandoned the option
to get stronger

276
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,125
how to use a sword
that makes him stronger?

277
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:35,166
- Uh, hang on.

278
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,166
What do you mean by--

279
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:38,291
- Subaru.
- Eh?

280
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,041
- We need to talk
about something.

281
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,333
- Has Rem told you
what's been going on?

282
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:50,833
- The feeling I sensed
was something like a presence

283
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:53,291
through the sense
that I share with my sister.

284
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,166
I wish she could have used
her clairvoyance

285
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,958
to get a clear picture,
but that's all I have.

286
00:12:58,041 --> 00:12:59,041
- So you must have picked up

287
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:01,875
a nasty sort of synesthesia
from her, I take it?

288
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:03,375
- We're not sure
of the details yet,

289
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:06,000
but it's
from the Mathers domain,

290
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:08,833
which you know
as Margrave Roswaal's territory.

291
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:10,375
It seems some troubling movement

292
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:13,041
was seen in the vicinity
of his mansion.

293
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,208
Parts of the domain

294
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:16,583
are already on high alert
as we speak

295
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:18,041
- Troubling movement?

296
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:18,583
- Indeed.

297
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:21,000
We foresaw this situation

298
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:24,500
from the moment the margrave
declared his intention

299
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:27,291
to back Miss Emilia, a half-elf.

300
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:31,041
- You mean all of this is
happening because of prejudice?

301
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:33,958
- That is likely
a correct summation.

302
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:34,875
- [sputters]

303
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:36,541
<i>The moment I leave her,</i>

304
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:37,916

00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,791
- [gasps]

306
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:40,500
<i>- Everyone around her</i>

00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:43,666
<i>Only one person</i>

308
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:48,291
<i>and that would be me.</i>

309
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:49,625
Okay, then.

310
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:52,666
We have to go there and
help settle things, right?

311
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,458
- You mustn't, Subaru.

312
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:57,833
You have to obey
Miss Emilia's orders.

313
00:13:57,916 --> 00:13:59,208
She said that you
should focus on healing,

314
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:01,916
and I agree with her.

315
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Making sure you're healed
must take priority.

316
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:07,916
- Rem, no one's
at Emilia's side.

317
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,083
You and I are the only ones
who can help her.

318
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:11,250
- [gasps]

319
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:14,166
- You heard what I said,
Miss Crusch.

320
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:18,541
We're going back to the
mansion,
right back to where Emilia is.

321
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,833
'Til it's taken care of,
my healing will just have to--

322
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:23,583
- Subaru Natsuki,
if you leave at this time,

323
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:25,333
I'm left with no choice

324
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:27,416
- but to make you my enemy.
- Uh...

325
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,583
- Perhaps I need to correct
one idea you have.

326
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:32,958
I've only allowed you
to stay here as a guest

327
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:36,291
and receive treatment
because I'm contracted to do so.

328
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,541
- Contracted?

329
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:38,958
- Yes, that's right.

330
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:40,625
Emilia and I made an agreement

331
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:43,458
regarding your treatment
as well as your safety.

332
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:46,125
However, if you
abandon that yourself,

333
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:49,250
I am not obligated
to continue protecting you.

334
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:50,666
The moment
you leave this household,

335
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,125
that deal is broken,

336
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:55,541
and Emilia and I will
not hesitate to become enemies.

337
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:57,625
- I was wrong about you.

338
00:14:57,708 --> 00:15:00,083
I thought
that maybe, just maybe,

339
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:02,291
you and I
could actually get along.

340
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:04,416
Your advice,
that was just a little joke

341
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,458
over some drinks, right?

342
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:08,291
I was stupid
to take you seriously

343
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:11,208
when you told me, an enemy,
to do what I could.

344
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:11,958
You don't want me to leave,

345
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:14,291
because getting Emilia
out of trouble

346
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:15,875
would be bad for you,
wouldn't it?

347
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,625
- I think you seem to have
gotten some things wrong.

348
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:20,958
- Felix, enough.
- No, I will say it.

349
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:23,500
The mistake he's making
is a bit too grave.

350
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:26,291
Even if you leave here
and rush to her side,

351
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:27,708
nothing will change.
It's a waste of time.

352
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:31,208
After making a fool of yourself
at the castle

353
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:34,500
and being clobbered by Julius,
you still don't realize that?

354
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:35,541
You'll be much better off
staying with us

355
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:38,458
and finishing up your treatment.

356
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:41,375
- I've decided.

357
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:43,333
I'm going back to Emilia.

358
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:46,458
Thanks for taking care of me,
though it wasn't for long.

359
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:48,958
- A good man knows
how to take a warning.

360
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:50,458
I guess that saying's not true.

361
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:53,166
- It's because of your warning
that I've made up my mind.

362
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,750
Thanks for that.

[ground dragons snorting]

364
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:00,416
Rem, how long
until we reach the mansion?

365
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,375
- About 2 1/2 days, I think.

366
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:04,625
- Over two days?

367
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:06,708
But it took less
than half a day to get here.

368
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:08,166
- When we came here,

369
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,583
we used a road
that's covered in fog now.

370
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:11,625
We'll have to use a detour.

371
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:12,708
- Who cares about a little fog?

372
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:16,208
- The fog is created
by the White Whale.

373
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:19,375
If we encounter it,
we'd never get out alive.

It is very much appreciated.

In my master's stead,

378

thank you for all the kindness
you've shown us during our
stay.

take care of yourselves.

- Are you getting
anything from Ram?

382
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:45,875
- Not yet. To an extent,

383
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:48,416
our shared sense is something
consciously controlled.

384
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,666
I could be wrong,

385
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,708
but I believe
what I felt this morning

386
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:54,625
was something that exceeded
my sister's control.

387
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:55,958
- I see.

388
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:58,791
So Ram didn't even mean
to let us know about it.

389
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:04,041
Is she trying to keep us
from getting involved?

390
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:07,208
But why?

391
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:09,625
She needs me by her side.

Once I do,
I'm sure she'll understand.

She has to.

Can't help that, I guess.

You're pretty worried
about the mansion

after what you felt through
your shared sense, aren't you?

Hey, it'll be fine.

00:31:04,958 --> 00:31:06,541
I'm hoping
that if he can see her,

650
00:31:06,625 --> 00:31:09,041
maybe his condition will change.

651
00:31:11,541 --> 00:31:14,000
- I realize this is tasteless,
but I must ask you something.

652
00:31:15,958 --> 00:31:18,041
How can you give
so much of yourself

653
00:31:18,125 --> 00:31:18,916
for Subaru Natsuki?

654
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,875
Your relationship with him
is not the same

655
00:31:21,958 --> 00:31:25,125
as that of a master and servant,
like Felix and mine,

656
00:31:25,208 --> 00:31:27,541
but I hesitate to conclude
that your behavior

657
00:31:27,625 --> 00:31:30,375
and the glances you cast
are those a woman gives a man.

658
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:35,416
I'm sorry.
That's really too forward.

659
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,291
- Forget I said--
- No. No, it's not that.

660
00:31:37,375 --> 00:31:38,458
It's just...

661
00:31:38,541 --> 00:31:41,125
well, how can I put it?

662
00:31:42,375 --> 00:31:43,291
You see...

663
00:31:47,625 --> 00:31:52,125
all of this is because Subaru
is really special to me.

664
00:31:52,208 --> 00:31:53,208
- [gasps]
- Huh?

665
00:31:54,333 --> 00:31:55,500
- Um...

666
00:31:55,583 --> 00:31:57,625
CRUSCH: Please, forgive me.

667
00:31:57,708 --> 00:32:00,041
I was stunned speechless
for a moment.

668
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:03,583
I'd say Subaru Natsuki
is a lucky man.

669
00:32:03,666 --> 00:32:06,166
- Hah! You can say that again.
If he ever recovers,

670
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:08,250
I'll have to make sure
to tease him to the max.

671
00:32:08,333 --> 00:32:09,458
- [giggles]

672
00:32:09,541 --> 00:32:11,166
- Safe travels.

673
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:12,458
- Good luck with everything.

[fire crackling]

676
00:32:34,166 --> 00:32:38,000
- I know I mustn't let
my personal feelings interfere,

677
00:32:38,083 --> 00:32:40,041
but...

678
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:42,625
if I'm being completely honest
with myself,

679
00:32:42,708 --> 00:32:44,125
I felt happy to have

680
00:32:44,208 --> 00:32:47,208
so much one-on-one time with you
at Miss Crusch's house.

681
00:32:47,291 --> 00:32:48,541
I realize once we
get back to the mansion,

682
00:32:48,625 --> 00:32:51,083
things won't be like that.

683
00:32:52,458 --> 00:32:54,583
Even though I knew
something was troubling you,

684
00:32:54,666 --> 00:32:56,083
I'm sorry.

685
00:32:56,166 --> 00:32:59,541
Even though I heard that you
had quarreled with Miss
Emilia,

686
00:32:59,625 --> 00:33:01,416
causing a rift
between the two of you,

687
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,125
- I'm sorry.
- [ground dragon sighs]

688
00:33:03,208 --> 00:33:04,416
- I know you'll be all right.

689
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:07,208
Just you wait.

690
00:33:07,291 --> 00:33:08,958
You're demonically inspired.

691
00:33:14,833 --> 00:33:15,458
And so driven.

692
00:33:15,541 --> 00:33:18,166
You're a remarkable person.

You stole my sister's horn

00:39:06,541 --> 00:39:08,583
which is why I ask why,
for what reason,

814
00:39:08,666 --> 00:39:09,916
for what purpose,
for what resolution,

815
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,625
for what possible outcome
do you act so utterly crazed?

816
00:39:12,708 --> 00:39:13,958
- [shudders]

817
00:39:14,041 --> 00:39:16,041
- Your so-called insanity
is far too sane.

818
00:39:16,125 --> 00:39:19,000
To behave so cleverly
and quietly

819
00:39:19,083 --> 00:39:21,041
as if seeking sympathy
for your situation,

820
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:23,916
it is a demeaning insult,
a true madness.

821
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
- [groaning]

822
00:39:27,083 --> 00:39:30,083
- You are a fake,
a poorly acted madman.

823
00:39:30,166 --> 00:39:31,916
If your insanity was genuine,

824
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,833
you would pay no heed
to the gazes of others.

825

- [sobbing]

826
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:38,000
- [laughs] How comical.

827
00:39:38,083 --> 00:39:40,833
How completely comical!

- [laughs]
- [weeps]

829
00:39:42,875 --> 00:39:45,708
- How I pity you.

830
00:39:45,791 --> 00:39:48,416
I pity
your wretched, despicable,

831
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,000
wicked, ugly, lowly,
diminutive, sinful being

832
00:39:50,083 --> 00:39:52,875
from the bottom of my heart.

833
00:39:52,958 --> 00:39:54,625
Yet despite those shortcomings,

834
00:39:54,708 --> 00:39:56,791
you are so loved!

835
00:39:56,875 --> 00:39:59,208
[yelps] You mean
that you'd rather waste away

836
00:39:59,291 --> 00:40:02,416
in stagnation than repay
the goodwill shown to you?

837
00:40:07,875 --> 00:40:09,958
That makes you...

838
00:40:10,041 --> 00:40:12,666
truly slothful.

839
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:14,916

- I found your lair.

843
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:28,833
What have you done?!

844
00:40:28,916 --> 00:40:30,125
- [wails]

845
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:33,708
How absolutely fantastic
this is!

846
00:40:33,791 --> 00:40:36,125
A girl, a lone girl,
is so badly injured.

847
00:40:36,208 --> 00:40:38,500
Yet she presses on for this boy!

848
00:40:38,583 --> 00:40:41,375
- That's enough
of your nonsense, Witch Cultist!

849
00:40:41,458 --> 00:40:43,291
You're fools to carry out
your insubordinate acts

850
00:40:43,375 --> 00:40:47,500
in Lord Roswaal's domain
without his permission!

851
00:40:47,583 --> 00:40:49,500
In my absent master's stead,

852
00:40:49,583 --> 00:40:51,875
I will bring
the death penalty upon you!

853
00:40:51,958 --> 00:40:54,000
- And you'll do all that
in your battered state?

854
00:40:54,083 --> 00:40:56,166
Correct me if I'm wrong,

855
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:58,375
but you really only came here
to retrieve this boy,

856
00:40:58,458 --> 00:41:00,291
and if that's the case,
you should stop saying

857
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:02,041
these tempting things
that sound, oh, so attractive.

858
00:41:02,125 --> 00:41:04,250
- Don't you touch him.

859
00:41:04,333 --> 00:41:06,708
- Eh? What was that?

860
00:41:06,791 --> 00:41:08,625
- I said don't you touch him!

- [squeals]

862
00:41:11,916 --> 00:41:14,375
That shot was utterly fantastic,
a work of art,

863
00:41:14,458 --> 00:41:16,125
but tell me, why does such
a believer in love as yourself

864
00:41:16,208 --> 00:41:18,958
adhere to someone like him?

865
00:41:19,041 --> 00:41:21,250

about Subaru, bastard!

That was nothing short

I summon the Unseen Hand.

00:42:02,833 --> 00:42:03,916
Look at her, boy.

883
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
- Just look at her.
- [moans]

884
00:42:05,083 --> 00:42:07,791
- This is a result
of your actions.

885
00:42:07,875 --> 00:42:10,166
- By doing nothing,
you practiced sloth,

886
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:12,791
and because of that,
the girl is dead.

887
00:42:12,875 --> 00:42:15,041
You killed her.
It was all your doing!

888
00:42:15,125 --> 00:42:17,666
Or more to the point,
your lack of doing anything!

889
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:19,250
How awful! How completely awful!

- With my arm,

with my fingers, it was you.

It was you. It was you.

[shrill]
It was you! It was you!

894
00:42:28,875 --> 00:42:31,333
You killed her.

This place has turned

913
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:15,833
I'll just leave it!

914
00:43:15,916 --> 00:43:17,250
All right, men.

915
00:43:17,333 --> 00:43:19,833
Time for you to resume
your previously planned duties

916
00:43:19,916 --> 00:43:21,958
and rendezvous
with the other fingers.

917
00:43:22,041 --> 00:43:24,958
The Ordeal will proceed
on the scheduled day.

- your position in all this...
- Bastard, I'll kill you...

- to be completely honest
with you,

921
00:43:30,083 --> 00:43:32,541
I have no idea what it is,

922
00:43:32,625 --> 00:43:35,333
so I shall simply judge you
as our lord sees fit.

Should the Gospel happen
to find its way to you,

I'm sure you'll be saved

- Oh?

932
00:43:54,083 --> 00:43:57,208
Ah, yes, you were also
a believer in love.

933
00:43:57,291 --> 00:43:59,708
You sacrificed yourself for it,
defying your own faith,

934
00:43:59,791 --> 00:44:02,875
but you fell just before
your feelings reached him,

leaving your love
with nowhere to go,

That makes you
a truly slothful one.

I...

977
00:45:56,291 --> 00:45:58,125
love you.

978
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:02,916
- Rem?

979
00:46:05,166 --> 00:46:07,791
[crying]

980
00:46:13,291 --> 00:46:15,000

[music playing]

982
00:46:25,041 --> 00:46:25,916
Okay, Rem. Let's go.

983
00:46:32,083 --> 00:46:33,291
[music continues]

984
00:46:37,041 --> 00:46:39,000
[gasping]

985

[snow crunching]

986
00:46:55,125 --> 00:46:57,041
Damn you, Betelgeuse.

987
00:47:00,666 --> 00:47:02,500
Damn you, Betelgeuse.

988
00:47:05,541 --> 00:47:07,875
[wind gusting]

989
00:47:22,041 --> 00:47:24,291
[crying]

990
00:47:24,375 --> 00:47:26,041
Betelgeuse, damn you!

00:47:26,125 --> 00:47:28,666
[crying]

992
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:33,250
Betelgeuse!

993
00:47:33,333 --> 00:47:36,083
[rumbling]

994
00:47:41,625 --> 00:47:43,250
PUCK: Sleep...

995
00:47:43,333 --> 00:47:45,208
along with my daughter.

996
00:47:50,166 --> 00:47:51,916
[instrumental playing]

997
00:49:22,666 --> 00:49:24,208
KADOMON: Hey.

998
00:49:24,291 --> 00:49:25,583
- [gasps]
- You listening?

999
00:49:25,666 --> 00:49:28,250
- Huh?
- Now, don't you "huh" me.

1000
00:49:28,333 --> 00:49:29,208
What's your problem?

1001
00:49:29,291 --> 00:49:30,166
It's like
you suddenly spaced out.

1002
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:31,333
- I, uh...

1003
00:49:31,416 --> 00:49:33,208
REM: Subaru.

1004
00:49:34,791 --> 00:49:35,708
- Rem-Rem.

1005
00:49:35,791 --> 00:49:37,416
- Yes?

1006
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:39,416
What's the matter?

1007
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:42,125
You look like
you've just seen a ghost.

1008
00:49:43,375 --> 00:49:44,791
- It's you.
- Me?

1009
00:49:44,875 --> 00:49:46,541
What is it?

1010
00:49:46,625 --> 00:49:47,708
- Rem-Rem.

1011
00:49:47,791 --> 00:49:48,750
- Yes?

1012
00:49:50,291 --> 00:49:51,333
- I'm just...
- Look...

1013
00:49:51,416 --> 00:49:54,583
I hate to interrupt when you're
just getting heated up,

1014
00:49:54,666 --> 00:49:57,333
but I can't do business
with you two flirtin' there.

1015
00:49:57,416 --> 00:49:59,333
[market chatter]

1016
00:49:59,416 --> 00:50:01,208
REM: Do you think
I could ask you something?

1017
00:50:01,291 --> 00:50:02,541
- What is it?

1018
00:50:02,625 --> 00:50:04,541
- Well, I may be mistaken,

1019
00:50:04,625 --> 00:50:06,416
but it's just, um...

1020
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:09,583
that unpleasant odor.

1021
00:50:09,666 --> 00:50:12,458
It seems to have grown
even stronger on you.

1022
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:16,083
- Unpleasant odor, huh.

1023
00:50:16,166 --> 00:50:17,750
Well, if that's got you worried,

1024
00:50:17,833 --> 00:50:19,500
then you can
just keep holding my hand.

1025
00:50:19,583 --> 00:50:20,875
- Huh?

1026
00:50:20,958 --> 00:50:23,250
I mean, it feels a lot safer
like this, doesn't it?

1027
00:50:23,333 --> 00:50:24,708
- [gasps]

1028
00:50:24,791 --> 00:50:25,708
Yes.
