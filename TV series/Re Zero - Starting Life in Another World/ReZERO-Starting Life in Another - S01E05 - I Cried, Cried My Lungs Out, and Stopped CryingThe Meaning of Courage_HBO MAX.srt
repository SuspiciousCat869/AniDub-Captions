00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:10,666
- Visualizing I can do.

162
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,625
I fantasize like a champ.

163
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:16,625
Nyom, nyom, nyom,
nyom, nyom.

164
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:20,083
[whooshing]

165
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:21,083
- What the--

166
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:22,250
Well, that's not good.

167
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:23,291
Looks like the gate just--

168
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:26,250
- [shouting]

169
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:31,791
- Long story short,

170
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:33,666
you don't have very good control
over your gate,

171
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:36,125
so I suggest you shouldn't
try too hard.

172
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:38,625
- You're the one who said
I'd be fine.

173
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,875
- [laughs]
- That's so not cute.

174
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:42,541
- Well, for better or for worse,

175
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:44,916
it doesn't seem like your gate
is very well used.

176
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,916
That would explain why the mana
inside ignored the user's will

177
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,333
and simply burst its way out.

178
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:51,916
- What am I,
some kind of soy sauce bottle

179
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,041
with a loose cap?
[grunts]

180
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:55,541
- You shouldn't move.

181
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:57,791
That little experiment used up
all the mana in your body.

182
00:07:57,875 --> 00:08:00,958
You might not be able
to work anymore today.

183
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:02,083
- No, I have to!
- [gasps]

184
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:04,000
Don't try to overdo it!

185
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:06,250
- This is exactly when I need
to overdo it.

186
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:08,333
I can't waste a single day.

187
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:11,958
- Goodness, you really
are hopeless.

188
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:13,666
Take this.

189
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,375
- What?
[gurgles]

190
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,000
- Chew it up.
- Hmm?

191
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:20,166
- Chew it up and swallow it.
Ready?

192
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,375
Go.
- [grunts]

193
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:23,666
[screams]

194
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:25,583
Whoa.

195
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:26,833
What did I just eat?

196
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:28,541
- [giggles]
A little something

197
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:30,041
called a bocco fruit.

198
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:31,125
When you eat one of these,

199
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:32,833
the mana in your body activates

200
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:35,208
and then your gate regains
some of its strength back.

201
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:36,666
- [groans]

202
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:40,083
Sorry, I guess I've caused you
some trouble, haven't I?

203
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:43,416
- I don't think you understand,
Subaru.

204
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,458
- Huh?

205
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:46,375
- It's infinitely
more satisfying

206
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:48,333
to hear a single thank you than
to be subjected to a barrage

207
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:51,041
of sorry after sorry.

208
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:52,875
I did it because I wanted
to help you,

209
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:55,291
not because I was looking
for an apology.

210
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:56,333
Okay?

211
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:57,958
- [gasps]

212
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:00,333
[distant wolves howling]

213
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:02,708
- So, given what you've seen
of our new guest

214
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:03,750
and everything he can do so far,

215
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:06,708
what do you think of him,
dear Ram?

216
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:08,416
- In terms of abilities,

217
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,916
he's completely incompetent,

218
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,125
but he can be excessively
quick-witted when it counts. I

219
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:15,416
believe it may be necessary
to keep an eye

220
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,000
on him for a time.

221
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:18,833
- This is a problem
we must handle

222
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:21,166
with the utmost care
and caution.

223
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:24,000
And I ask that you be sure
to give the proper warnings

224
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:27,166
<i>to your sister so that</i>
<i>she doesn't act rashly.</i>

225
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:31,500
- I guess that's about all
I can expect of the first day.

226
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:34,791
I earned quite a bit of trust
from Ram and Rem, I think.

227
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,125
Way to go.

228
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:38,833
But the bigger problem here
is that shaman's attack.

229
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:40,750
How do we go
about fighting that?

230
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,625
- You want to know more
about shamans, I suppose?

231
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:49,000
- Yeah, like how do you
avoid curses, for instance?

232
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:50,750
- There is no way
to do so.

233
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:51,791
- Huh?

234
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:53,541
- It's impossible
to undo a curse

235
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:56,125
once it's been activated,
I suppose.

236
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:58,083
Once they've begun,
that's it.

237
00:09:58,166 --> 00:09:59,500
That's what curses are.

238
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:03,041
- It's possible to nullify
instant death resistances?

239
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:05,500
- However,
before they're activated,

240
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:07,416
curses are nothing more
than simple spells,

241
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,041
so I can easily undo them.

242
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:10,208
[grunts]

243
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:11,500
[sniffing]

244
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,500
That is the Witch's scent.

245
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:16,208
- You know,
Rem mentioned that, too.

246
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:17,791
Who is this witch?

247
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:20,625
Are all of these witches related
to shamans in any way?

248
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:25,041
- In this world,
when one says the word witch,

249
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,875
they're really just referring
to one person in particular.

250
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:31,166
- The Witch of Envy, right?

251
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,041
- Exactly.

252
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:34,250
The Witch of Envy, Satella.

253
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,583
Long ago she devoured
the six witches

254
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:38,416
who bore the names
of the deadly sins

255
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,916
and drained half
the world dry.

256
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,250
She's pretty much the worst
of the worst, I suppose.

257
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:43,208
- [gasps]

258
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:44,500
- The story goes that she

259
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:45,916
was starved for love.

260
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,208
It's said that she doesn't
understand human language.

261
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:52,166
It's also been said that her
body never withers from age,

262
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,416
weakens from sickness,
or dies.

263
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,166
And although she was sealed
by the powers of a dragon,

264
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:58,541
a hero,
and a sage,

265
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:01,250
they were still never able
to destroy her flesh.

266
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:04,333
It's said that her body
is that of a half elf

267
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:06,125
with silver hair.

268
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,250
- [grunts]

269
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:12,333
- It's Satella.

270
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,458
- What would it take
to make somebody steal

271
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:17,500
the Witch of Envy's name?
Hang on.

272
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:19,083
I guess "steal" makes
the person sound bad.

273
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:22,000
Maybe I should say to make
somebody borrow the Witch

274
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:24,083
of Envy's name instead.
- Either way,

275
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:26,625
they must have no fear of death,
I suppose.

276
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:28,916
One who would steal the name
of the Witch of Envy

277
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,458
can be called nothing
but insane.

278
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:31,833
- [gasps]

279
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:36,375
I see.

280
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:38,000
So that's why.
- Huh?

281
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:39,333
- She wouldn't have
to be involved

282
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:42,500
in this royal selection mess
if everyone just saw her

283
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:43,791
as some kind of crazy freak.

284
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:45,625
- What are you talking about?

285
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:49,333
- Nothing at all.
Don't worry about it.

286
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:52,333
- Good morning!

287
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:53,833
It's another sunny day,

288
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:55,250
perfect for drying laundry!

289
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:57,208
Let's make this a day filled
with happiness!

290
00:11:57,291 --> 00:12:00,125
Make this a day of victory!

291
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:03,250
Victory!

292
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:05,166
- You're so energetic again
this morning.

293
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:06,166
- Yep!

294
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,458
Even as I'm ordered around

295
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:09,000
and disciplined
by the maid sisters,

296
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:11,666
I'll enjoy my life of servitude
to the fullest once again!

297
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,291
But when that lifestyle wears me
out--and you know it will--

298
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:15,750
I'll come rest my head
in your lap

299
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:17,125
so save it for me, okay?

300
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:18,833
When you wash your face
that way,

301
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:20,250
you really look like a cat!

302
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:22,708
So, do spirits get sleepy
and worn out?

303
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:23,750
Do they ever oversleep?

304
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:25,625
- Yeah, don't you people
get sleepy

305
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:27,125
when you're fatigued, too?

306
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:31,875
Spirits can go through something
that's similar when their mana

307
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:33,833
is depleted.
[yawns]

308
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:35,041
- [yawns]

309
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:36,875
- Did you two stay up all night?

310
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:38,666
I bet you were up late talking
about who you like, right?

311
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,666
That's it, isn't it?
Come on!

312
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,541
Let me in on the fun.
Huh?

313
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:43,875
So who do I like?

314
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:45,250
Well, it's embarrassing
to say but--

315
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:46,833
- The one that I like is Puck

316
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:48,791
and the one that Puck likes
is me.

317
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:50,458
There.
Conversation's over.

318
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:52,875
- It's mutual?
Then where do I fit in?

319
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:54,125
- Nowhere.

320
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:56,625
Lia's head over heels
for my charms.

321
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:58,916
It's not like you're a bad guy
or anything.

322
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,041
But compared to me
you've got nothing to offer.

323
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:02,791
- [shouts]
- You should give up on Lia

324
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:04,458
and just--
[both shouting]

325
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:06,291
- Don't get carried away,
you two.

326
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:08,958
I'm going to get mad
if you keep up this foolishness.

327
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:11,041
both: Sorry, sorry!
Didn't mean to make you mad!

328
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:12,291
- Whoopsie!

329
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:13,708
I'd better get going
or the maid sisters

330
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:16,416
will be angry!
Bye!

331
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:17,500
- [groans]

332
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:19,708
- Mm?
Hey, what's wrong?

333
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:23,083
You don't look very happy.

334
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:26,291
- I just feel sort of uneasy.

335
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:28,291
I don't think I can explain it.

336
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:31,916
- Well, I can't exactly blame
you for being confused,

337
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,291
'cause this has gotten
to be kind of a problem.

338
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:37,125
- [gasps]
- Hey, don't worry!

339
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:38,791
Forget about it!
Everything's fine!

340
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:40,166
- What do you mean, problem?

341
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,500
- Just relax, okay?

342
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:43,375
I'll clean this up so fast
no one will get hurt.

343
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:44,625
See?
Already done.

344
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:47,875
- What I'm saying
is Subaru's mind is mixed up.

345
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:50,041
The inside and outside
are all jumbled.

346
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:53,916
- I think that attitude of yours
is quite admirable

347
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,708
but you were the one who knocked
it over in the first place.

348
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:58,458
I'll go find a replacement.

349
00:13:58,541 --> 00:13:59,791
- No, that's okay!

350
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:01,250
Let me take care
of the vase and flowers!

351
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:02,583
I insist!

352
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:04,666
You can just keep doing
your own work!

353
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:07,916
<i>- If he keeps this state</i>
<i>of confusion going,</i>

354
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,125
<i>he'll wear himself out</i>
<i>before long.</i>

355
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:14,375
- [exhales sharply]

356
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:17,166
It feels pretty great
to finish a job, huh, Rem-Rem?

357
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,958
- It was work that you created

358
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:21,333
and took care of on your own,
though.

359
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:24,041
When did you learn
where the vases are kept?

360
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:25,458
- [grunts]

361
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:26,583
- Did my sister--
- That's right!

362
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,833
Your sister told me!

363
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:31,125
Since she knows me and how much
of a klutz I am,

364
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:33,333
she said, "You're bound to break
a vase eventually.

365
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:35,000
"I'll tell you where
the extra vases are

366
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,708
so you'll always be prepared."

367
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:38,000
[laughs]
- Subaru--

368
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:39,000
- Whoops!

369
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:40,333
I totally forgot about some work

370
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:41,666
that Ram asked me to do!

371
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,083
Would you excuse me for a bit?

372
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:44,333
I can take care of it quick.

373
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:47,416
See you later!
I'll come find you soon!

374
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:50,166
<i>I feel sick.</i>

375
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,375
[knocking]

376
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:53,625
Don't you think
my knife technique

377
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:55,500
has come a long way
in just one day?

378
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:57,291
I think my talent
has finally awakened.

379
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:59,041
<i>I feel sick.</i>
<i>I feel sick.</i>

380
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:00,375
<i>I feel sick.</i>

381
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:02,666
That makes such amazing
crafting possible.

382
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,916
There must be a miracle residing
in my fingertips right now.

383
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,166
Illusion!
<i>I feel sick.</i>

384
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,208
<i>I feel sick.</i>
<i>I feel sick.</i>

385
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:11,458
<i>I feel sick.</i>

386
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:13,250
<i>I feel sick.</i>
Honestly, Mili,

387
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:15,333
every time we meet,
you stir up my heart.

388
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:18,958
You're such a sinful girl.
You're guilty, I tell ya!

389
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:21,125
<i>I should be able</i>
<i>to laugh better.</i>

390
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:23,666
<i>I should be able</i>
<i>to make them laugh better.</i>

391
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,166
<i>I can't fail this time.</i>

392
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,958
<i>I can't waste a single second.</i>

393
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:29,791
<i>I have to throw all my strength</i>
<i>into my work and produce</i>

394
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:30,833
<i>some kind of results or--</i>
[gasps]

395
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:33,625
Oh, Ram!
I wasn't slacking.

396
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:35,541
I'll finish up all my work.
Just you wait.

397
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:37,541
Now, why don't you go kick back
in your room

398
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:38,500
and take a well-earned siesta
while I--

399
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:43,500
[vomiting]

400
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:46,125
[gasping]

401
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:48,208
Damn, I look so lame.

402
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:52,000
I don't have time to spend
whining like this.

403
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:54,041
You idiot.

404
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:56,375
[grunts]

405
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:57,541
- Subaru?
- [grunts]

406
00:15:57,625 --> 00:15:58,958
[chuckles]

407
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,333
Mili!
- Subaru.

408
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:02,375
Come with me.
- Uh-oh!

409
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:04,750
A personal invitation?
From Mili?

410
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:06,083
This is moving so fast.

411
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:07,666
How joyous.
How embarrassing.

412
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:08,791
How rare!
Say anything.

413
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:10,250
Tell me to do anything.

414
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:11,916
For you I'd dive into fire,
water, the loot house, anywhere!

415
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,916
- Listen to me.
- [grunts]

416
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,125
Hey, come on.

417
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:17,500
The Mili I know would never
be so cold.

418
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:19,625
Wait, are you some kind of fake?

419
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:21,000
No way.
That's impossible!

420
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:22,291
How could anyone else be capable
of looking so gorgeous

421
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:25,208
that when I see her all I want
to do is hug her?

422
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:27,250
- All right.

423
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:29,666
Subaru, you heard me.
- Wha--

424
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,125
- Let's go.

425
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:33,000
Now sit down right here.

426
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:35,375
- Can't I sit on the bed
or a chair?

427
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:37,000
Why does it have
to be the floor?

428
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:38,291
- Just sit down!

429
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:39,708
- With pleasure!
Right away!

430
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:40,958
Yes, ma'am.

431
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:43,208
- [grunts]

432
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,500
Only this once, all right?

433
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:55,625
- Huh?

434
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,666
[grunts]

435
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,500
- Your position
is a little weird,

436
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:03,166
and it tickles a bit.

437
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:05,916
- I can rest in your lap?

438
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,416
- Don't say that out loud!
It's embarrassing!

439
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,000
And no looking up here.
Face the wall.

440
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:12,333
Close your eyes.

441
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:14,625
- You're even more adorable
when you're embarrassed,

442
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:18,291
but why did you suddenly let
me do this, anyway?

443
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:20,458
I mean, when did I do something
worthy enough

444
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:22,250
to earn a reward this awesome?

445
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:24,208
- Enough of that
weird tough act.

446
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:27,041
You don't need
to do that right now.

447
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:29,166
Isn't this what you wanted?

448
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:32,291
Didn't you tell me to lend you
my lap when you were exhausted?

449
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:35,291
I can't do this all the time,

450
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:36,833
but today is special.

451
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:39,375
- Hey, it's only my second day
of working here.

452
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:40,916
If I'm already completely
worn out,

453
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,458
what kind of weakling am I?

454
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:46,791
- It's plain to see that you're
overwhelmed about something.

455
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:50,375
But you're not going to tell me
what's really going on, are you?

456
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:54,708
I don't know if doing this will
make things any easier for you,

457
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:57,958
but if it helps at all,
I'm happy to.

458
00:17:58,041 --> 00:18:00,250
- [chuckles]

459
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:02,291
Mili, come on now.

460
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:03,708
You don't have to.

461
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,333
- Are you tired?

462
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:08,333
- No, I'm totally fine, really.

463
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:10,041
- Do you feel troubled?

464
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:12,916
- If you're this nice to me,
I'm gonna fall in love with you.

465
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,958
When you--I mean,
like that.

466
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:18,375
- It's been rough.

467
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:20,541
Hasn't it?

468
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,666
<i>[Rie Takahashi's</i>
<i>"Bouya no Yume yo"]</i>

469
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:31,000
- Yeah, it was rough.

470
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:33,416
And it was so painful.

471
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,291
I was just so terrified.

472
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:37,083
I was so sad, it hurt.

473
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:38,916
It hurt so much.

474
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:39,708
I thought I'd die.

475
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:41,541
- [grunts]

476
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:43,166
- I tried so hard and I--
[sniffs]

477
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,750

00:36:51,541 --> 00:36:54,041
And the brothers Dyne and Cain
are always fighting over which

954
00:36:54,125 --> 00:36:56,500
one of them will be lucky enough
to marry Petra.

955
00:37:00,875 --> 00:37:02,833
All of those kids matter to me.

956
00:37:02,916 --> 00:37:04,083
I know their names.

957
00:37:04,166 --> 00:37:05,458
I know their faces.

958
00:37:05,541 --> 00:37:08,250
And I know what they each want
to do in the future.

959
00:37:08,333 --> 00:37:10,125
On top of that,
I promised them

960
00:37:10,208 --> 00:37:12,375
we'd do radio calisthenics
again tomorrow.

961
00:37:13,708 --> 00:37:16,791
I keep my promises and I
make sure others keep theirs.

962
00:37:17,583 --> 00:37:18,916
No matter what happens,

963
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
I'm gonna do those exercises
with those kids again.

964
00:37:22,083 --> 00:37:24,750
That means I'm going in there.

965
00:37:28,458 --> 00:37:30,291
- Very well, then.
- [grunts]

966

an eye on you.

967
00:37:32,916 --> 00:37:35,041
It wouldn't be right
if I failed to do so.

968
00:37:35,125 --> 00:37:37,041
- Yeah, absolutely.

969
00:37:37,125 --> 00:37:38,166
After all, you need
to be there to make sure

970

I don't do anything shady.

I smell living creatures.

982

- Is it the kids?

983
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:12,333
- I'm not certain but
it doesn't smell like

984
00:38:12,416 --> 00:38:13,458
beasts to me.

985
00:38:25,583 --> 00:38:26,750

It's them!

989
00:38:31,458 --> 00:38:32,750
They're still alive.

990
00:38:32,833 --> 00:38:34,958
- That's true,
but their breathing is shallow.

991
00:38:35,041 --> 00:38:36,500
They're all unconscious
and weak.

992
00:38:36,583 --> 00:38:39,083
If left alone--
- They're weak?

993
00:38:39,166 --> 00:38:40,375
Is it the curse?

994
00:38:42,791 --> 00:38:44,833
And we finally found them.

995
00:38:44,916 --> 00:38:46,750
Rem, can't you do anything
to reverse it?

996
00:38:46,833 --> 00:38:48,708
- Not a spell of this magnitude.

997
00:38:48,791 --> 00:38:50,291
If only my sister were with us.

998
00:38:50,375 --> 00:38:52,000
I'm sure she could do something.

999
00:38:52,083 --> 00:38:53,541
I'll try what I can

1000
00:38:53,625 --> 00:38:54,875
and cast a healing spell
to comfort them.

1001
00:38:54,958 --> 00:38:57,708
When they're calm we can carry
them back with us.

1002
00:38:59,541 --> 00:39:01,833
- Yeah, sounds good.
And I'll--

1003
00:39:01,916 --> 00:39:04,416
Who am I kidding?
I'm so useless.

1004
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:07,041
I'll keep an eye out for--
- Subaru.

1005
00:39:07,125 --> 00:39:08,791
- Petra, you're awake.

1006
00:39:08,875 --> 00:39:10,125
All right, good.

1007
00:39:10,208 --> 00:39:11,541
You're a tough girl.

1008
00:39:11,625 --> 00:39:12,958
I need you to save
your strength, though.

1009
00:39:13,041 --> 00:39:14,500
Don't overdo it.

1010
00:39:14,583 --> 00:39:15,875
I'll take you back home where
you can say good-bye

1011
00:39:15,958 --> 00:39:17,333
to the pain.
Just rest up

1012
00:39:17,416 --> 00:39:19,041
for the time being--
- One is--

1013
00:39:19,125 --> 00:39:22,958
one is still in--in the--

1014
00:39:23,041 --> 00:39:24,708
- Hold on.
What did you say?

1015
00:39:24,791 --> 00:39:27,041
Petra!
[grunts]

1016
00:39:28,916 --> 00:39:30,333
Damn it, she's right.

1017
00:39:30,416 --> 00:39:32,583
I don't see the little girl
with the braid anywhere.

1018
00:39:32,666 --> 00:39:34,125
- No, please don't go.

1019
00:39:34,208 --> 00:39:35,458
It's far too dangerous.

1020
00:39:35,541 --> 00:39:37,750
And if the mabeast took her
it may already be--

1021
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:40,125
- Look, I understand what
you're trying to tell me,

1022
00:39:40,208 --> 00:39:42,875
I really do,
but you heard what Petra said.

1023
00:39:42,958 --> 00:39:45,791
She was trying to tell us
the other girl was taken away.

1024
00:39:46,666 --> 00:39:47,791
Even in her state,

1025
00:39:47,875 --> 00:39:49,583
she showed concern
for her missing friend

1026
00:39:49,666 --> 00:39:51,750
before asking for my help.
Don't you see?

1027
00:39:51,833 --> 00:39:54,625
She put her friend's life
and well-being before her own.

1028
00:39:56,541 --> 00:39:58,750
I want to respect
Petra's feelings.

1029
00:39:58,833 --> 00:40:00,291
If you take something on,

1030
00:40:00,375 --> 00:40:02,083
you should see it through
to the bitter end.

1031
00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:03,458
- If you get too greedy,

1032
00:40:03,541 --> 00:40:05,000
then you run the risk
of taking on

1033
00:40:05,083 --> 00:40:07,708
much more than you could ever
possibly carry back with you.

1034
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,958
- I know but that's the reason
you came along, isn't it?

1035
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:12,833
- And what does the situation
have to do with me?

1036
00:40:12,916 --> 00:40:16,666
- Those kids need you now more
than they ever did before.

1037
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:18,083
When the villagers show up here,

1038
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:20,083
leave the children with them
and then follow me out

1039
00:40:20,166 --> 00:40:22,041
into the forest.
[grunts]

1040
00:40:22,125 --> 00:40:24,333

our opponent presents

1041
00:40:24,416 --> 00:40:25,958
or when the villagers
will arrive.

1042
00:40:26,041 --> 00:40:28,541
At worst there's always a chance
that you'll wander off somewhere

1043
00:40:28,625 --> 00:40:30,291
and I would never be able
to find you.

1044
00:40:30,375 --> 00:40:32,583
- It'll be fine 'cause
I'm confident that you won't

1045
00:40:32,666 --> 00:40:35,291
lose track of me.
- What makes you so sure?

1046
00:40:35,375 --> 00:40:37,000
- Even if no one else does,

1047
00:40:37,083 --> 00:40:38,791
I know that you
can pick up my scent.

1048
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:42,750
The foul odor that hangs on me.

1049
00:40:42,833 --> 00:40:44,125
The Witch's scent.

1050
00:40:44,208 --> 00:40:45,500
Isn't that right?

1051
00:40:45,583 --> 00:40:46,583
- [gasps]
Wait, Subaru.

1052
00:40:46,666 --> 00:40:49,500
How do you know about--
- No idea.

1053
00:40:49,583 --> 00:40:50,750
[chuckles]
There's a ton

1054
00:40:50,833 --> 00:40:52,166
I don't understand.

1055
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:54,833
So much that no matter how
many times I start over,

1056
00:40:54,916 --> 00:40:57,375
I can't seem to find
the answer I'm looking for.

1057
00:40:59,333 --> 00:41:02,250
Just like there are many things
you want to ask me,

1058
00:41:02,333 --> 00:41:05,541
there are a ton of things that
I want to ask you about, too.

1059
00:41:05,625 --> 00:41:07,083
So when all of this
is taken care of,

1060
00:41:07,166 --> 00:41:08,291
we should talk.

1061
00:41:08,375 --> 00:41:10,208
We can chat until our voices
are hoarse.

1062
00:41:10,291 --> 00:41:11,791
It's a promise.

1063
00:41:11,875 --> 00:41:13,416
- Huh?

1064
00:41:14,583 --> 00:41:17,125
- I just want you to know
I trust you, Rem.

1065
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:18,500
And this is my attempt
at showing

1066
00:41:18,583 --> 00:41:20,125
that you can trust me also.

1067
00:41:20,208 --> 00:41:21,250
So that promise I made,

1068
00:41:21,333 --> 00:41:23,708
I'm sticking to it.

1069
00:41:24,791 --> 00:41:26,083
- All right, very well.

1070
00:41:26,166 --> 00:41:28,541
Then I promise on my end, too.

1071
00:41:28,625 --> 00:41:30,666
I plan on asking you
many questions

1072
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:32,083
so be ready for them.
- You got it.

1073
00:41:32,166 --> 00:41:35,125
- And once the villagers arrive
to help the children,

1074
00:41:35,208 --> 00:41:37,583
I'll join you.
Just be careful out there.

1075
00:41:37,666 --> 00:41:39,083
Don't do anything reckless.

1076
00:41:39,166 --> 00:41:41,500
- Appreciate the concern,
but don't worry about a thing.

1077
00:41:41,583 --> 00:41:43,666
I'm demonically
inspired tonight.

1078
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:44,833
- Demonically inspired?

1079
00:41:44,916 --> 00:41:47,791
- Demon version
of divine inspiration.

1080
00:41:47,875 --> 00:41:50,666
For some reason
it's my favorite phrase lately.

1081
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:53,083
- Please take care.
I'll join you soon.

1082
00:41:59,333 --> 00:42:01,541
- If the one who cursed
those kids from the village

1083
00:42:01,625 --> 00:42:03,875
really turns out to be that dog
from earlier today,

1084
00:42:03,958 --> 00:42:07,041
then there's no way I can lose
this fight, right?
