1
00:00:10,274 --> 00:00:11,783
Time to get out of bed, Sissy...

2
00:00:12,251 --> 00:00:13,506
The day has finally come!

3
00:00:13,531 --> 00:00:14,571
Aren't you excited?

4
00:00:15,007 --> 00:00:16,232
No, not exactly.

5
00:00:16,502 --> 00:00:17,931
But it's your moment to shine!

6
00:00:18,558 --> 00:00:22,952
I know big, important events are pretty much an
everyday occurrence for you, but today is extra special...

7
00:00:23,202 --> 00:00:24,727
I'm not the only one who thinks so...

8
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:29,317
The rest of the girls in our dorm have been
waiting for this almost as anxiously as I have.

9
00:00:29,867 --> 00:00:31,518
My moment to shine, huh?

10
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:37,126
There must have been any number of girls who would've
been better suited for something like this than I am.

11
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:38,971
Aw... always modest!

12
00:00:39,074 --> 00:00:43,181
You shouldn't be. If you ask a hundred people
who best represents the pride of Tokiwadai,

13
00:00:43,206 --> 00:00:45,222
every single one of them would say your name.

14
00:00:45,556 --> 00:00:48,773
Well... since it's all set, it's too late to back out now.

15
00:00:49,053 --> 00:00:50,975
That's the attitude I'm looking for...

16
00:00:51,245 --> 00:00:52,158
Now, then...

17
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,401
Let's see about getting you changed, shall we?

18
00:00:58,774 --> 00:01:00,809
I can dress myself. I don't need your help.

19
00:01:01,586 --> 00:01:02,835
Let's get this over with.

20
00:02:37,162 --> 00:02:41,657
One day out of each year, the Tokiwadai Girls'
dormitories open their doors to the public...

21
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:43,818
This is a special annual event.

22
00:02:44,672 --> 00:02:46,297
It's our midsummer festival.

23
00:02:46,598 --> 00:02:48,561
You have all invited special guests,

24
00:02:48,586 --> 00:02:50,858
and today they will be allowed inside.

25
00:02:51,366 --> 00:02:56,499
I expect you all to behave in a way that
befits your status as Tokiwadai dorm residents.

26
00:02:56,531 --> 00:02:58,197
There will be no missteps!

27
00:02:59,691 --> 00:03:01,505
I get that we want to be hospitable...

28
00:03:01,658 --> 00:03:03,703
but are these outfits really necessary?

29
00:03:07,781 --> 00:03:09,018
Welcome to our dorm...

30
00:03:09,168 --> 00:03:11,561
Would you like a pamphlet listing today's events?

31
00:03:13,214 --> 00:03:14,207
You sure are cute...

32
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,439
Can I take a picture?

33
00:03:15,716 --> 00:03:17,115
I'm afraid not, sorry...

34
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:19,847
We ask that within the dorms there be no photography.

35
00:03:19,872 --> 00:03:20,997
Yeah... Work it... Work it...

36
00:03:21,063 --> 00:03:22,566
No photography!

37
00:03:23,249 --> 00:03:25,981
Yes! Yes...! Yes... Perfect!

38
00:03:26,082 --> 00:03:27,582
What did I just say...?

39
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:29,040
Why are you taking pictures?

40
00:03:29,065 --> 00:03:31,130
I am working in an official capacity...

41
00:03:31,296 --> 00:03:33,632
I'm the midsummer festival's archivist this year.

42
00:03:34,265 --> 00:03:36,023
Somebody needs to take pictures...

43
00:03:36,279 --> 00:03:38,725
Future classes will want to look back on this festival.

44
00:03:39,248 --> 00:03:41,132
But Sissy... I have to say,

45
00:03:41,232 --> 00:03:44,564
your outfit doesn't photograph well
with those stupid shorts underneath it...

46
00:03:44,764 --> 00:03:47,432
Couldn't you put on something
a little nicer for the occasion?

47
00:03:49,992 --> 00:03:51,332
Please tell me, Kuroko...

48
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:54,275
How exactly will sticking a camera up my skirt

49
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:58,061
help future Tokiwadai classes to "look
back" on this year's festival? Huh?!

50
00:03:58,086 --> 00:03:59,290
Now, now, Sissy.

51
00:03:59,315 --> 00:04:01,613
I think we have a misunderstanding here...

52
00:04:01,638 --> 00:04:02,583
Hey, you guys!

53
00:04:05,106 --> 00:04:07,022
You two are always wrestling.

54
00:04:10,051 --> 00:04:12,458
I can't thank you enough for inviting us, Shirai!

55
00:04:12,755 --> 00:04:13,712
What an honor!

56
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:16,841
We're here for the exclusive Tokiwadai
Middle School midsummer festival!

57
00:04:17,091 --> 00:04:18,171
I can't wait!

58
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:22,524
I'm certain today's festivities will
exceed even my wildest imaginations!

59
00:04:22,607 --> 00:04:23,899
I'm glad you could be here...

60
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,298
We won't disappoint...

61
00:04:25,536 --> 00:04:27,467
The events to come will be memorable...

62
00:04:27,657 --> 00:04:30,080
I'm certain you'll enjoy everything we have to offer.

63
00:04:30,232 --> 00:04:32,875
Now then... shall I take you on a little tour?

64
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:33,704
Just a minute.

65
00:04:34,761 --> 00:04:38,327
Shirai, when were you planning
on helping us out with the buffet?

66
00:04:38,382 --> 00:04:41,331
Uh... I, uh, guess I must have forgotten.

67
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:42,704
So?

68
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:45,470
Oh, allow me to introduce you...

69
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:49,363
This is Maika Tsuchimikado, from
Ryouran Girls' Housekeeping School...

70
00:04:49,442 --> 00:04:51,692
She and her classmates are helping us out this year...

71
00:04:51,857 --> 00:04:54,065
They're overseeing all the food for the festival.

72
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:55,300
Oh, I've heard of that place!

73
00:04:55,325 --> 00:04:57,938
They really specialize in training future housekeepers?

74
00:04:58,699 --> 00:04:59,565
Yes, they do.

75
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:00,837
It's a pleasure to meet you.

76
00:05:01,646 --> 00:05:04,204
Maika... These are two very good friends of mine...

77
00:05:04,431 --> 00:05:07,151
Kazari Uiharu and... Ruiko Saten.

78
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:08,294
Hey, there.

79
00:05:08,571 --> 00:05:10,115
It's so nice to meet you!

80
00:05:10,332 --> 00:05:13,138
If there's anything you need,
feel free to give me a shout.

81
00:05:14,273 --> 00:05:16,528
And as for you... time to work!

82
00:05:16,553 --> 00:05:19,404
Hey! Stop dragging me for a second, will you?

83
00:05:19,482 --> 00:05:21,152
I can't just abandon my friends.

84
00:05:21,177 --> 00:05:23,624
Oh, but you can abandon your work, is that it?

85
00:05:23,685 --> 00:05:25,242
Now you're just twisting my words.

86
00:05:25,444 --> 00:05:27,506
I can show you around, since she's busy.

87
00:05:31,313 --> 00:05:32,207
All right, then...

88
00:05:32,377 --> 00:05:33,806
What should we start with first?

89
00:05:33,908 --> 00:05:34,950
Is there anywhere you'd like to...

90
00:05:34,975 --> 00:05:37,047
Yes! Yes, yes, yes!

91
00:05:37,542 --> 00:05:39,709
There is someplace I'd like to see, very much!

92
00:05:40,069 --> 00:05:41,664
Right here... and here... and here...

93
00:05:42,088 --> 00:05:44,171
Oh! And from here to down there, too.

94
00:05:44,675 --> 00:05:46,327
Okay... everywhere, then?

95
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:47,749
I'll have you know...

96
00:05:47,877 --> 00:05:48,784
For today, at least,

97
00:05:48,809 --> 00:05:51,372
I am no longer mild-mannered Kazari Uiharu!

98
00:05:51,657 --> 00:05:53,050
Yes, I hereby announce...

99
00:05:53,374 --> 00:05:55,369
The arrival of my alter ego!

100
00:05:56,474 --> 00:05:58,132
Well... that's fine...

101
00:05:58,303 --> 00:05:59,937
We'll see everything there is to see.

102
00:06:02,789 --> 00:06:05,457
Wow! What an incredible display!

103
00:06:05,482 --> 00:06:07,500
That's what you get from a top-notch school.

104
00:06:07,663 --> 00:06:09,090
Well? What do you think?

105
00:06:09,418 --> 00:06:12,101
Are all of these really made entirely of sugar?

106
00:06:12,126 --> 00:06:13,960
It seems almost impossible.

107
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:15,217
Let's see...

108
00:06:22,263 --> 00:06:24,066
Yep, that's pure sugar all right.

109
00:06:24,357 --> 00:06:26,377
You can't just eat that, you know!

110
00:06:26,649 --> 00:06:28,697
They're handcrafted display models!

111
00:06:28,884 --> 00:06:30,158
Right... Misaka?

112
00:06:30,183 --> 00:06:31,297
Here, Misaka.

113
00:06:31,582 --> 00:06:32,582
Have another, please.

114
00:06:32,607 --> 00:06:33,857
It's really no trouble at all.

115
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,436
Oh... thanks...

116
00:06:35,671 --> 00:06:37,838
It's lovely, really, but I don't think so.

117
00:06:41,565 --> 00:06:44,318
Wow... the detailing on this is amazing.

118
00:06:45,632 --> 00:06:46,797
Oh, hey, look at that!

119
00:06:47,489 --> 00:06:49,211
We can even do it ourselves!

120
00:06:49,457 --> 00:06:52,024
Okay, Uiharu... I'll give it a try.

121
00:06:52,049 --> 00:06:53,978
You're going to come with us, aren't you, Misaka?

122
00:06:54,376 --> 00:06:55,982
Oh, well... Thank you, but...

123
00:06:56,007 --> 00:06:57,577
That settles it! This'll be great...

124
00:06:57,774 --> 00:06:59,435
Okay we've got a party of three.

125
00:07:07,308 --> 00:07:09,273
I think I did a pretty decent job...

126
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:10,654
Here, take a look, Saten.

127
00:07:13,356 --> 00:07:16,432
This one's not quite as good as the
one I made for my brother's book-bag.

128
00:07:23,773 --> 00:07:25,529
Oh, hey... how's it coming?

129
00:07:31,469 --> 00:07:33,577
Oh, wow! These are magnificent!

130
00:07:34,267 --> 00:07:37,692
You can really tell that these were
arranged by proper young ladies, huh?

131
00:07:37,815 --> 00:07:39,846
They're all so graceful and refined.

132
00:07:40,155 --> 00:07:42,674
I think that's exactly the impression they want to give...

133
00:07:43,061 --> 00:07:44,842
This is a girls' school, after all.

134
00:07:44,991 --> 00:07:46,598
Excuse me, I was wondering...

135
00:07:46,688 --> 00:07:49,165
Did you arrange all the flowers here by yourselves?

136
00:07:49,776 --> 00:07:51,493
Yes, that's why we're displaying them.

137
00:07:51,801 --> 00:07:54,759
Oh...! They're very beautiful.

138
00:07:54,784 --> 00:07:56,784
Thanks for saying so... We tried.

139
00:07:56,809 --> 00:08:00,223
I have to say, the flowers in your
hair are far prettier than these are.

140
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,247
It's true.

141
00:08:01,643 --> 00:08:03,696
You have an eye for arrangements, clearly.

142
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:06,299
What are you talking about?

143
00:08:31,897 --> 00:08:34,064
Tokiwadai is a fine institution...

144
00:08:34,315 --> 00:08:35,707
The festival is perfect.

145
00:08:35,866 --> 00:08:36,940
I'm amazed...

146
00:08:36,965 --> 00:08:38,471
Each exhibit is flawless...

147
00:08:38,867 --> 00:08:40,846
Our school could never aspire to this...

148
00:08:40,928 --> 00:08:44,294
Tokiwadai has achieved a greatness
that few places could hope to match.

149
00:08:44,554 --> 00:08:45,304
Well, Saten...?

150
00:08:46,402 --> 00:08:47,447
Don't you agree?

151
00:08:51,952 --> 00:08:54,774
You're awful! How could you do
that to me, here of all places?!

152
00:08:54,933 --> 00:08:55,766
Welcome back.

153
00:08:56,482 --> 00:08:59,482
Well... you were looking so dreamy, I had to wake you up.

154
00:08:59,613 --> 00:09:02,368
I wasn't dreaming, thank you very much. I'm wide awake!

155
00:09:02,726 --> 00:09:04,377
Here. That should do it.

156
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:07,849
Thank you so very much!

157
00:09:08,753 --> 00:09:12,141
Oh... and please allow me to
wish you the very best of luck.

158
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,000
Yeah, well... thanks...

159
00:09:14,524 --> 00:09:15,428
That's nice of you.

160
00:09:18,501 --> 00:09:22,418
Lucky! I can't believe Misaka tied your apron for you.

161
00:09:22,556 --> 00:09:24,067
Just look at her, Uiharu...

162
00:09:24,219 --> 00:09:26,299
She's what Tokiwadai is all about.

163
00:09:26,444 --> 00:09:28,473
Yeah... that is so true.

164
00:09:35,826 --> 00:09:37,913
So... are you guys getting hungry?

165
00:09:51,555 --> 00:09:53,384
That's it, I don't ever want to leave!

166
00:09:53,539 --> 00:09:55,442
I'm just going to have to move in with you.

167
00:09:55,664 --> 00:09:57,386
I'll go look for a seat, all right?

168
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:58,871
Oh... okay.

169
00:10:04,441 --> 00:10:06,477
What's wrong? Oh, is it not cut yet?

170
00:10:08,565 --> 00:10:10,357
Well. Allow me.

171
00:10:17,662 --> 00:10:19,799
How could you do that to such an exquisite cake?!

172
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:23,439
This from someone who didn't think twice
about popping a sugar statue in her mouth?

173
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:26,171
How can you possibly eat that much cake?

174
00:10:26,368 --> 00:10:29,213
People always say you have a
second stomach for desserts, right?

175
00:10:31,018 --> 00:10:33,139
I... I can't move...

176
00:10:33,835 --> 00:10:36,001
That's what happens when you eat twenty plates of food.

177
00:10:36,372 --> 00:10:38,216
But... it's good...

178
00:10:38,343 --> 00:10:40,057
and they said it was all you can eat...

179
00:10:40,538 --> 00:10:41,616
Come on...

180
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,840
we can't let the students see you in this state...

181
00:10:44,157 --> 00:10:46,189
Move it... Get up, get up!

182
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:50,832
If you're not careful, it's all gonna come back up!

183
00:10:57,928 --> 00:10:59,650
Big Sister Mikoto!

184
00:11:03,463 --> 00:11:05,521
Huh? You're from Asunaro Park...

185
00:11:05,827 --> 00:11:07,310
So, what are you doing here?

186
00:11:12,274 --> 00:11:13,992
I invited them to come today.

187
00:11:15,248 --> 00:11:16,336
Guess what?

188
00:11:16,753 --> 00:11:20,355
We made rings out of beads and drew
pictures and built stuff with sugar!

189
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,294
Wow... that sounds like fun.

190
00:11:22,319 --> 00:11:23,345
Yeah, it was!

191
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:25,857
But you want to know what I'm most excited about?

192
00:11:25,998 --> 00:11:26,668
Do you?

193
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:27,553
Yes...

194
00:11:27,848 --> 00:11:29,149
I would love to know.

195
00:11:29,183 --> 00:11:31,582
Seeing Big Sister Mikoto on stage!

196
00:11:34,156 --> 00:11:35,457
Me, too. I can't wait!

197
00:11:35,482 --> 00:11:37,058
Yeah, I hope it's not gonna be much longer!

198
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:39,368
Okay, wait. Who told you guys about that...?

199
00:11:39,479 --> 00:11:41,245
It's not a big deal, really!

200
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:45,787
Yeah! We're gonna cheer for you!

201
00:11:45,957 --> 00:11:47,114
Good luck, Big Sister!

202
00:11:50,065 --> 00:11:51,232
You heard her, right?

203
00:11:51,589 --> 00:11:53,709
You're going to give them a show to remember.

204
00:11:54,123 --> 00:11:56,291
Yes... Of course.

205
00:11:57,142 --> 00:11:58,886
Now, now... No running.

206
00:11:58,911 --> 00:12:00,184
You might fall and get hurt.

207
00:12:01,524 --> 00:12:03,370
I mean... Absolutely no running!

208
00:12:06,802 --> 00:12:08,034
That's just great...

209
00:12:08,229 --> 00:12:11,647
Does she think putting extra pressure
on me is gonna make me do any better?

210
00:12:11,672 --> 00:12:12,651
Hey, Misaka!

211
00:12:13,061 --> 00:12:15,231
Are you really gonna perform something for us?

212
00:12:15,256 --> 00:12:16,987
Huh? Oh, well, I...

213
00:12:17,012 --> 00:12:18,690
Yeah! Really?

214
00:12:18,715 --> 00:12:21,254
So how come you didn't say anything about it earlier?

215
00:12:21,827 --> 00:12:24,327
Oh! I get it! It's gonna be a surprise!

216
00:12:24,482 --> 00:12:25,997
Huh? No, no, no...

217
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:27,307
It isn't like that.

218
00:12:27,665 --> 00:12:28,769
Don't worry about it...

219
00:12:28,982 --> 00:12:30,684
We won't ask any more questions.

220
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:31,762
But...

221
00:12:31,786 --> 00:12:33,595
Ah! Quiet! Say no more!

222
00:12:33,732 --> 00:12:34,982
We'll just wait and see.

223
00:12:35,271 --> 00:12:36,207
Yeah, don't tell us...

224
00:12:36,232 --> 00:12:37,709
I want it to be a surprise...

225
00:12:37,867 --> 00:12:40,098
Ah... what could it be?

226
00:12:40,172 --> 00:12:41,797
I can't wait to find out!

227
00:12:41,915 --> 00:12:43,600
Um... yeah...

228
00:12:44,071 --> 00:12:45,000
Hey, Misaka!

229
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,328
Have you seen Shirai around lately?

230
00:12:48,898 --> 00:12:51,704
Didn't you take her earlier
to help you out with the buffet?

231
00:12:52,327 --> 00:12:54,295
Yeah, but she's not in the kitchen anymore...

232
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:56,742
The little brat must have run away on me.

233
00:12:57,882 --> 00:13:02,940
One of the guests here is a freakishly big eater, so we
have our hands full just getting enough food on the table.

234
00:13:03,024 --> 00:13:04,163
It's a big hassle.

235
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:07,698
Kuroko... she's so sneaky.

236
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:09,047
Oh, yeah...

237
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:10,787
Good luck today.

238
00:13:11,404 --> 00:13:12,941
I can't wait to see you up there!

239
00:13:14,499 --> 00:13:16,499
So much suspense! Oh, my!

240
00:13:16,649 --> 00:13:17,794
It's killing me!

241
00:13:20,454 --> 00:13:23,373
Ah! That was one delicious meal!

242
00:13:23,524 --> 00:13:24,922
What's up next? Where to?

243
00:13:24,947 --> 00:13:26,499
Well, isn't it obvious?

244
00:13:26,563 --> 00:13:27,473
No... Where?

245
00:13:28,273 --> 00:13:29,323
Well, if we keep going straight, we can...

246
00:13:29,348 --> 00:13:30,507
Uh, sorry, guys.

247
00:13:32,155 --> 00:13:34,029
I need to use the restroom real quick...

248
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:36,093
Go on ahead without me.

249
00:13:38,214 --> 00:13:39,929
Hey... what's up with her?

250
00:13:40,017 --> 00:13:42,154
She's been acting kinda nervous and twitchy.

251
00:13:42,574 --> 00:13:43,521
Really? You think so?

252
00:13:43,546 --> 00:13:44,953
Last call, everybody.

253
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:46,629
Do we have any other bidders?

254
00:13:46,766 --> 00:13:47,740
Saten, look...

255
00:13:48,098 --> 00:13:49,589
Something's going on out here.

256
00:13:50,355 --> 00:13:51,831
I don't hear anybody...

257
00:13:52,032 --> 00:13:54,285
Okay! That makes this our final bid!

258
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:55,377
Oh, that's cool...

259
00:13:55,472 --> 00:13:56,591
They're having an auction.

260
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:59,578
Those are some incredibly rare items up for bid...

261
00:13:59,787 --> 00:14:01,625
I've seen some of that stuff in a magazine.

262
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:04,368
It's so exclusive, you can't even get it on the market.

263
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,188
Leave it to Tokiwadai!

264
00:14:13,762 --> 00:14:14,928
Hey there, Konori!

265
00:14:16,843 --> 00:14:18,653
Oh... what are you doing here?

266
00:14:19,007 --> 00:14:21,505
I had no idea you were into purses that much.

267
00:14:24,077 --> 00:14:27,058
Oh! No... this isn't my style normally.

268
00:14:27,109 --> 00:14:28,693
They're doing it for charity, though...

269
00:14:28,857 --> 00:14:32,786
The proceeds they get from the auction are
being donated to the Child Error children...

270
00:14:33,234 --> 00:14:36,307
As a member of Judgment, it is
expected for me to participate.

271
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:37,182
You know...

272
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:39,749
that sounds suspiciously like an excuse.

273
00:14:39,781 --> 00:14:40,810
Well... it isn't.

274
00:14:41,357 --> 00:14:43,028
Well, why don't you guys bid on something?

275
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:44,459
No...

276
00:14:44,654 --> 00:14:46,110
I don't think we can...

277
00:14:46,269 --> 00:14:47,303
We can't afford it.

278
00:14:47,328 --> 00:14:49,107
We don't have a whole lot of spending money.

279
00:14:50,393 --> 00:14:51,697
Oh, that's all right.

280
00:14:52,149 --> 00:14:53,746
Let's see what we have now.

281
00:14:54,107 --> 00:14:55,874
It's a lovely stationery set.

282
00:14:55,899 --> 00:14:57,440
We'll start the bidding at one hundred!

283
00:14:57,467 --> 00:14:58,135
200!

284
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,019
300!

285
00:14:59,043 --> 00:14:59,609
400!

286
00:14:59,634 --> 00:15:00,565
There, you see?

287
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:01,748
I guess you're right...

288
00:15:02,142 --> 00:15:03,843
Okay. 10,000!

289
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,879
Why are you here?

290
00:15:13,165 --> 00:15:15,530
Tsuchimikado's been looking all over for you.

291
00:15:15,586 --> 00:15:18,359
This is the reason you abandoned your duty in the kitchen?

292
00:15:18,479 --> 00:15:21,249
Just to drop a bunch of money on some stationery?

293
00:15:21,338 --> 00:15:21,997
Oh, no...

294
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:25,165
This isn't just a stationery set, I'll have you know.

295
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:26,923
It is so very much more...

296
00:15:27,013 --> 00:15:29,888
You see, it was put up for
auction by none other than Sissy...

297
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:32,421
These pens and pencils... these pages...

298
00:15:32,529 --> 00:15:34,734
They are a part of her, like bits of her soul.

299
00:15:35,761 --> 00:15:38,022
I... am so... lucky!

300
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,088
Those belonged to Misaka...

301
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:41,390
That explains it.

302
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:43,274
Speaking of which, where is she...?

303
00:15:43,536 --> 00:15:44,591
She's not with you?

304
00:15:44,769 --> 00:15:46,415
Oh... well, you see...

305
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,193
Good afternoon, ladies.

306
00:15:50,623 --> 00:15:52,554
Just perfect. What are you doing here...?

307
00:15:52,707 --> 00:15:54,749
And what's with that outfit you've got on?

308
00:15:54,774 --> 00:15:57,732
I should think that would be
obvious, even to someone like you.

309
00:15:57,815 --> 00:16:00,940
I felt certain you would need coaching
on what it is to be a proper maid,

310
00:16:00,965 --> 00:16:04,649
so I condescended to come and provide
the benefit of my expert instruction...

311
00:16:04,732 --> 00:16:07,349
I know! I am so generous of spirit.

312
00:16:07,388 --> 00:16:08,387
So benevolent!

313
00:16:08,442 --> 00:16:11,756
I cordially invite you to study
my impeccably attired self...

314
00:16:11,829 --> 00:16:14,125
This maid uniform is authentically English...

315
00:16:14,249 --> 00:16:16,079
With an Eastern flair, of course...

316
00:16:16,104 --> 00:16:18,303
It was designed specifically for today.

317
00:16:18,328 --> 00:16:20,504
There's nothing authentic about that get-up.

318
00:16:20,766 --> 00:16:22,092
All right then, Shirai...

319
00:16:22,117 --> 00:16:23,357
Let's test your skill...

320
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:25,461
I want you to say, "Welcome home, my lady."

321
00:16:25,486 --> 00:16:27,949
Oh yeah?! Why would I want to do something like that?

322
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:30,063
You can't do it, can you?

323
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:32,899
Poor dear, even with that
outfit, I can see you're hopeless.

324
00:16:32,924 --> 00:16:34,178
I humbly beg your pardon...

325
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,232
I wonder if you would be kind
enough to offer a demonstration?

326
00:16:37,257 --> 00:16:39,722
I know so very little about good manners, you see.

327
00:16:39,747 --> 00:16:40,677
Oh, very well...

328
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:42,893
I am Mitsuko Kongo, the Maid of Maids.

329
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:44,370
I will show you how it is done.

330
00:16:44,607 --> 00:16:46,315
Please, watch me very closely.

331
00:16:47,483 --> 00:16:49,400
First a little twirl, and then...

332
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:50,903
Welcome home, my lady.

333
00:16:50,928 --> 00:16:52,137
It is so good to see you.

334
00:16:52,712 --> 00:16:53,308
Yes...

335
00:16:53,469 --> 00:16:55,406
Now, my friends and I are very thirsty.

336
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:57,082
Please bring drinks for everybody.

337
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:58,749
Yes, of course, my lady.

338
00:16:58,774 --> 00:16:59,632
Right away.

339
00:17:01,382 --> 00:17:04,208
Thank goodness simple-minded folks are so easy to handle.

340
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:06,357
Hey, guys. Good to see you.

341
00:17:06,498 --> 00:17:07,920
Yes, how have you been?

342
00:17:08,365 --> 00:17:10,383
Probably a lot better than you two...

343
00:17:10,631 --> 00:17:12,551
having to put up with someone like her.

344
00:17:13,608 --> 00:17:16,815
She can be trying sometimes,
but she's not a bad person, really.

345
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,933
Yeah, she's actually the one who
invited us to the midsummer festival...

346
00:17:20,196 --> 00:17:22,118
She's spent the whole year waiting for it...

347
00:17:22,221 --> 00:17:23,165
That's why we're here.

348
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:25,190
Wait... I'm confused now.

349
00:17:25,215 --> 00:17:26,829
You guys don't all live here in the dorm?

350
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:31,008
No, actually Tokiwadai's girls are split
up between two different dormitories...

351
00:17:31,199 --> 00:17:34,624
There's this one, of course, and then
there's also one inside the Garden of Learning.

352
00:17:34,649 --> 00:17:37,015
Wannai, Kongo, and I all live in the other one.

353
00:17:37,832 --> 00:17:39,477
You live in the Garden of Learning?!

354
00:17:39,575 --> 00:17:42,488
That magical paradise filled with elegant young ladies?

355
00:17:45,488 --> 00:17:47,987
Anyway... is Misaka around somewhere?

356
00:17:48,055 --> 00:17:50,957
Come to think of it, we haven't seen
her since she took a bathroom break.

357
00:17:51,065 --> 00:17:56,066
Oh... That's too bad. I wanted to tell her
how excited I am about seeing her perform today.

358
00:17:56,186 --> 00:17:58,560
Do you know what kind of performance Misaka's giving?

359
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,974
No, we have no idea. It's a surprise!

360
00:18:01,124 --> 00:18:02,874
Ooh... I wonder what it is?

361
00:18:02,899 --> 00:18:06,624
Oh! That's right! This is no time
for me to be hanging around here.

362
00:18:06,766 --> 00:18:10,326
I have to get a good seat so I can
capture Sissy's performance on camera!

363
00:18:13,522 --> 00:18:15,769
I wish they would stop being so excited.

364
00:18:16,705 --> 00:18:17,547
Oh, no...

365
00:18:17,928 --> 00:18:19,303
I'm breaking out in a sweat!

366
00:18:20,902 --> 00:18:22,140
Do I have the jitters?

367
00:18:22,779 --> 00:18:24,548
No. No way...

368
00:18:25,078 --> 00:18:27,120
That can't be happening to me of all people.

369
00:18:33,188 --> 00:18:36,267
I wonder what kind of surprise
she has in store for her performance.

370
00:18:36,475 --> 00:18:37,857
I can't wait to find out.

371
00:18:38,134 --> 00:18:38,999
Oh, dear...

372
00:18:39,399 --> 00:18:42,742
My heart's starting to pound, and
I've got butterflies in my stomach!

373
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,959
Why are you nervous? It's not your show.

374
00:18:46,328 --> 00:18:49,482
You guys are close, Shirai. Do you
know what Misaka's going to do up there?

375
00:18:49,565 --> 00:18:50,734
Of course I do.

376
00:18:51,665 --> 00:18:54,310
However... my lips are firmly sealed.

377
00:18:54,429 --> 00:18:56,907
S... E... A... L... E... D!

378
00:19:02,385 --> 00:19:03,218
Lovely!

379
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,187
Look at the flowers!

380
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:06,799
I can barely walk.

381
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:13,410
Oh, no...

382
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,825
My heart's going a million miles an hour.

383
00:19:16,557 --> 00:19:19,352
Ah! You've got to get it together, now!

384
00:19:19,377 --> 00:19:20,582
Um... Hey...

385
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,073
Sorry if I'm interrupting...

386
00:19:30,462 --> 00:19:33,629
It's just... I got separated from the person I came with.

387
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:35,804
Maybe you've seen her around...?

388
00:19:36,354 --> 00:19:38,384
She's about this tall, and she's wearing a nun's habit.

389
00:19:38,409 --> 00:19:39,259
What are you doing here?

390
00:19:40,705 --> 00:19:43,246
I said, what are you doing here? Answer me!

391
00:19:43,285 --> 00:19:44,764
Whoa... I'm sorry!

392
00:19:45,061 --> 00:19:47,020
Uh... I'm not doing anything wrong...

393
00:19:48,065 --> 00:19:50,215
See, I have an invitation and everything.

394
00:19:50,394 --> 00:19:52,058
Did you come here to make fun of me...?

395
00:19:52,189 --> 00:19:54,108
You wanted to laugh at my silly dress?

396
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:55,578
No... No way...

397
00:19:56,232 --> 00:19:57,890
I think it looks really pretty, actual...

398
00:19:58,565 --> 00:19:59,732
Get outta here!

399
00:20:02,735 --> 00:20:03,786
What is with that guy?

400
00:20:03,811 --> 00:20:05,732
He chooses now of all times to show up?

401
00:20:05,757 --> 00:20:07,424
I'm already enough on edge!

402
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:32,627
Oh, cool. She's doing a violin solo!

403
00:20:32,735 --> 00:20:35,674
Oh, wow! I didn't even know that she could play.

404
00:20:39,274 --> 00:20:39,935
Look at that.

405
00:20:40,462 --> 00:20:42,183
They have no idea I'm nervous.

406
00:20:43,495 --> 00:20:44,392
All right, then.

407
00:21:03,868 --> 00:21:04,797
What do you know.

408
00:21:05,195 --> 00:21:07,737
It looks like that guy is good for something, after all...

409
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,512
I didn't see that coming.

410
00:23:32,019 --> 00:23:33,846
Hey! Do you feel that swaying...?

411
00:23:33,948 --> 00:23:34,887
Back and forth...

412
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:36,857
Now, Sissy, you know I'm steadfast.

413
00:23:36,882 --> 00:23:39,080
I would never waver in the face of your lov...

414
00:23:39,105 --> 00:23:41,007
I'm talking about an earthquake!
