1
00:00:03,333 --> 00:00:04,253
This is true.

2
00:00:04,507 --> 00:00:09,396
The events I'm about to describe actually happened
to our friend's sister's roommate's boyfriend.

3
00:00:10,058 --> 00:00:14,083
It was a sultry summer evening, and this
boyfriend of hers was strolling through a park.

4
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:16,707
There was no sign of anyone else in the area.

5
00:00:17,247 --> 00:00:21,219
A lone woman appeared and came up to
him asking how to get the train station.

6
00:00:21,903 --> 00:00:26,706
The boyfriend was a polite young man, and
he graciously began giving her directions.

7
00:00:26,901 --> 00:00:33,857
As he did, the woman stared at him with a vacant
look in her eyes and started slowly lifting her hands.

8
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:39,707
Then, suddenly, there was a great whoosh!

9
00:00:39,732 --> 00:00:41,056
Why was there a whoosh?

10
00:00:44,287 --> 00:00:46,347
The strange woman removed her blouse.

11
00:00:49,581 --> 00:00:52,097
Please! That was the least scary story ever!

12
00:02:28,665 --> 00:02:32,951
We did a lot to create a creepy atmosphere,
but I don't think anything can save that story.

13
00:02:33,207 --> 00:02:33,689
Huh?

14
00:02:34,349 --> 00:02:37,397
It really happened to someone
we know. How is that not freaky?

15
00:02:37,539 --> 00:02:40,607
The legend of the Undress-tress
who disrobes without warning!

16
00:02:40,737 --> 00:02:41,886
No, not scary.

17
00:02:41,992 --> 00:02:45,827
It's more like a story about a sicko
who could use some serious therapy.

18
00:02:45,852 --> 00:02:47,061
Then how about another one?

19
00:02:47,192 --> 00:02:49,237
This site is full of different stories.

20
00:02:50,656 --> 00:02:54,080
"When you see the wind turbines spin
backwards, it's a sign of the apocalypse.

21
00:02:54,105 --> 00:02:55,671
Doom is just around the corner!"

22
00:02:55,696 --> 00:02:58,498
"Don't cross between districts at
four-forty-four in the afternoon.

23
00:02:58,523 --> 00:03:01,472
You'll find yourself in the
Imaginary Number School District!"

24
00:03:01,497 --> 00:03:05,292
It says there's the tool that'll instantly
increase your ability- The Level Upper!

25
00:03:06,026 --> 00:03:09,615
This is getting ridiculous. Would you
stop looking at that stupid site already?

26
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:13,165
Urban legends are useless. They
have no basis in scientific fact.

27
00:03:13,304 --> 00:03:15,089
This is Academy City after all.

28
00:03:15,114 --> 00:03:17,409
Geez, you have no sense of adventure.

29
00:03:17,984 --> 00:03:21,813
Besides, sometimes these stories are based
on real events that have just gotten twisted

30
00:03:21,838 --> 00:03:23,869
until they become crazy legends.

31
00:03:24,265 --> 00:03:25,189
Look at this one.

32
00:03:25,257 --> 00:03:27,913
"The boy with the power to
prevent other powers from working."

33
00:03:27,938 --> 00:03:29,924
That's a story you'd only hear in Academy City.

34
00:03:31,132 --> 00:03:33,769
The power to prevent other powers from working?

35
00:03:35,867 --> 00:03:37,742
That's the most absurd one we've heard!

36
00:03:37,785 --> 00:03:39,243
Nobody could have that ability.

37
00:03:39,525 --> 00:03:41,510
Please! Don't you agree, Sissy?

38
00:03:45,996 --> 00:03:47,329
Yeah, totally crazy.

39
00:03:47,453 --> 00:03:50,159
But if someone like that did
exist, I'd sure like to fight him.

40
00:03:52,207 --> 00:03:53,789
But, of course, he doesn't. So...

41
00:04:03,402 --> 00:04:05,148
Even more urban legends, huh?

42
00:04:10,222 --> 00:04:13,785
A boy who somehow has the power to
prevent other powers from working.

43
00:04:14,315 --> 00:04:15,467
Of all things.

44
00:04:17,042 --> 00:04:18,584
We got ourselves a cutie here.

45
00:04:18,849 --> 00:04:21,333
Oooh, and she's from Tokiwadai, too.

46
00:04:21,476 --> 00:04:23,596
Wanna come with us? Have some fun tonight?

47
00:04:23,948 --> 00:04:28,514
We'll even take you back to your dorm. Of course,
there's no telling how late it might be by then.

48
00:04:32,373 --> 00:04:35,634
What do these idiots think they're
going to accomplish by talking to me?

49
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:37,200
Pathetic.

50
00:04:38,163 --> 00:04:40,266
Everyone else is pretending not to see.

51
00:04:40,432 --> 00:04:41,593
It's not that they don't care.

52
00:04:42,132 --> 00:04:43,667
They just can't do anything about it.

53
00:04:43,793 --> 00:04:45,923
If they interfered, they'd only get themselves hurt.

54
00:04:46,003 --> 00:04:47,362
And that wouldn't help anyone.

55
00:04:47,815 --> 00:04:50,761
Everyone has to look out for
themselves. That's the way it works.

56
00:04:51,211 --> 00:04:54,958
And if there is somebody out there who would
jump in the middle of this to help out a stranger.

57
00:04:55,158 --> 00:04:56,631
Well, that person is just a fool.

58
00:04:56,656 --> 00:04:57,872
Oh, hey! There you are!

59
00:04:58,684 --> 00:05:00,574
Thanks for keeping her company, guys!

60
00:05:00,913 --> 00:05:03,530
You shouldn't wander off like
that. You know how much I worry!

61
00:05:04,413 --> 00:05:05,794
Okay! Thanks, again!

62
00:05:06,692 --> 00:05:08,175
You mind telling me who you are?

63
00:05:11,952 --> 00:05:16,581
Why couldn't you just play along? The plan was I pretend
to be your friend and casually walk you away from here.

64
00:05:16,606 --> 00:05:17,844
And now that's ruined!

65
00:05:17,869 --> 00:05:20,863
Why should I follow a convoluted
plan from some random guy?

66
00:05:20,888 --> 00:05:22,222
Who do you think you are, punk?

67
00:05:22,336 --> 00:05:23,628
Think you can make us look like fools?

68
00:05:23,653 --> 00:05:25,765
Yeah, dude, you got some kinda problem with us?

69
00:05:25,813 --> 00:05:27,021
No, I just...

70
00:05:29,198 --> 00:05:30,589
What's the use, really?

71
00:05:31,585 --> 00:05:33,335
Yeah, I've got a problem.

72
00:05:33,418 --> 00:05:35,452
You guys don't have any shame, do you?

73
00:05:35,477 --> 00:05:38,723
All of you ganging up like this
on a single, helpless young girl?

74
00:05:38,817 --> 00:05:42,649
It's pathetic! I mean, have you taken a
good look at her? She's basically a kid.

75
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:47,505
You heard her talking to me. She sounded like a
child who hasn't learned how to respect her elders.

76
00:05:48,038 --> 00:05:51,248
She looks sweet, but she still
hasn't outgrown her rebellious phase.

77
00:05:51,334 --> 00:05:52,693
That's how young she is!

78
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:56,944
And besides that, you can't even face this
defenseless child unless you gang up on her?

79
00:05:56,991 --> 00:05:57,743
You guys make me sick!

80
00:05:57,768 --> 00:06:00,107
You wanna know what's making
me sick right now, Wonder Boy?

81
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:01,432
You are!

82
00:06:22,137 --> 00:06:23,751
I just can't understand it.

83
00:06:23,834 --> 00:06:25,571
Why don't my shocks work on him?

84
00:06:26,114 --> 00:06:28,510
Could it really be like that urban legend says?

85
00:06:28,827 --> 00:06:30,129
No, impossible!

86
00:06:30,355 --> 00:06:32,679
If I hit him with my full force, he'd be toast.

87
00:06:32,795 --> 00:06:34,412
Next time I run into him, I'll...

88
00:06:34,563 --> 00:06:36,658
Can you remember any landmarks or anything?

89
00:06:37,347 --> 00:06:38,561
Landmarks?

90
00:06:38,743 --> 00:06:42,165
Hm. Well, there was a crosswalk in front of it, I think.

91
00:06:42,451 --> 00:06:45,498
That's not really a landmark.
There are kind of a lot of them here.

92
00:06:45,523 --> 00:06:46,199
It's you!

93
00:06:48,179 --> 00:06:50,205
Oh. Hey, Bug Zapper. What's up?

94
00:06:50,473 --> 00:06:52,898
Don't call me that! I'm Mikoto Misaka!

95
00:06:53,059 --> 00:06:55,601
And today is the day I'm gonna settle the score with you!

96
00:06:55,973 --> 00:06:56,990
Okay, that's nice.

97
00:06:57,015 --> 00:06:58,723
So does that mean you aren't busy right now?

98
00:06:59,008 --> 00:07:01,082
If it's time you want, I've got plenty to spare.

99
00:07:01,242 --> 00:07:01,904
Good deal.

100
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:05,507
Then do you think you could help this
woman find where she parked her car?

101
00:07:05,532 --> 00:07:06,206
Huh?

102
00:07:06,633 --> 00:07:12,036
Yeah. I know I parked it in a lot around here some
place, but I can't figure out exactly where it was.

103
00:07:12,061 --> 00:07:13,603
Uh, hold on.

104
00:07:13,783 --> 00:07:14,657
Why me?

105
00:07:14,682 --> 00:07:17,614
Well, there's somewhere important that I need to be now.

106
00:07:18,099 --> 00:07:19,967
You've got time, so it's fine, right?

107
00:07:20,873 --> 00:07:22,582
No, actually, it isn't fine!

108
00:07:22,723 --> 00:07:25,297
You want to weasel out of this,
but I'm not going to let you!

109
00:07:25,322 --> 00:07:28,707
And don't try to come up with some lame
excuse again, because it isn't going to work.

110
00:07:28,853 --> 00:07:30,827
Wow. It sure is hot out, don't you think?

111
00:07:34,874 --> 00:07:37,706
What... what are you doing that for?

112
00:07:38,781 --> 00:07:41,965
I've been walking around in the
blazing sun for quite a while now.

113
00:07:42,523 --> 00:07:43,825
I'm dripping with sweat.

114
00:07:46,015 --> 00:07:47,304
What is with this woman?

115
00:07:47,363 --> 00:07:49,832
I have no idea. I just met her a few minutes ago.

116
00:07:50,785 --> 00:07:53,692
Anyway, lady, would you please put your shirt back on?

117
00:07:55,837 --> 00:07:57,348
That woman is being assaulted!

118
00:07:57,373 --> 00:07:59,745
Huh? Is that boy ripping off her clothes?

119
00:08:00,167 --> 00:08:01,182
I think he is!

120
00:08:01,207 --> 00:08:02,064
No, really.

121
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:02,821
Huh?

122
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,548
You've got it all wrong!

123
00:08:05,573 --> 00:08:06,525
Hey, get back here!

124
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:07,495
Excuse me...

125
00:08:07,712 --> 00:08:10,789
If you're going to run off, could you
at least give me my shirt back, please?

126
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,348
Whatever, hurry up and put it back on, okay?

127
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:18,926
People are starting to stare!

128
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:26,662
That was refreshing. I feel so much better now.

129
00:08:29,168 --> 00:08:30,668
What's the deal with that woman?

130
00:08:30,693 --> 00:08:33,004
Just randomly stripping her clothes off in public?

131
00:08:33,942 --> 00:08:37,617
Huh? It really happened to someone
we know. How is that not freaky?

132
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:40,772
The legend of the Undresstress
who disrobes without warning!

133
00:08:41,143 --> 00:08:42,941
No way, that was just a story.

134
00:08:45,923 --> 00:08:46,433
Hello?

135
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:48,842
Hey, Sissy! Where are you right now? Are you busy?

136
00:08:48,894 --> 00:08:51,269
I was about to go have tea with Uiharu and Saten.

137
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:53,213
You're welcome to come along if you'd like.

138
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:56,583
Well, the thing is, I'm stuck helping out this weird lady.

139
00:08:56,954 --> 00:08:58,281
Weird? How so?

140
00:08:59,152 --> 00:09:01,769
She started stripping off her clothes without any warning?

141
00:09:03,506 --> 00:09:06,259
She's stripping! It's the Undresstress. It has to be!

142
00:09:06,284 --> 00:09:08,480
Oh, no, Misaka! Will you be okay?

143
00:09:08,575 --> 00:09:09,500
Let go! Please!

144
00:09:09,525 --> 00:09:11,161
Could you two try to get it together?

145
00:09:11,633 --> 00:09:14,243
Text me her picture, okay? I want documentation!

146
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:16,054
Get a grip, you guys.

147
00:09:16,147 --> 00:09:18,688
Don't go thinking she's something from an urban legend.

148
00:09:19,002 --> 00:09:21,863
She might seem a little odd, but
I'm sure she's just an ordinary...

149
00:09:21,888 --> 00:09:22,991
You said somebody is odd?

150
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:24,795
Is it me you're talking about?

151
00:09:27,019 --> 00:09:30,268
No. Of course not. I mean, you did take off your shirt.

152
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:31,296
Well...

153
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:36,576
The number you have dialed is unavailable.

154
00:09:36,601 --> 00:09:38,476
Please leave a message at the tone.

155
00:09:38,547 --> 00:09:40,929
That seems a little bit suspicious, don't you think?

156
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:44,100
Shouldn't we track Misaka down
and make sure that she's okay?

157
00:09:44,691 --> 00:09:46,983
You're really taking this urban legend seriously.

158
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,525
How incredibly childish.

159
00:09:51,185 --> 00:09:52,944
To thank you for keeping me company.

160
00:09:53,155 --> 00:09:54,667
Oh, all right. Thank you.

161
00:09:57,973 --> 00:09:59,158
Why something hot?

162
00:09:59,183 --> 00:10:00,975
Especially curry soup?

163
00:10:01,112 --> 00:10:04,647
Most people don't realize this, but when
it's hot out, a warm drink is better for you.

164
00:10:04,955 --> 00:10:09,698
Also, curry contains special spices that
help to relieve fatigue and rejuvenate the body.

165
00:10:09,732 --> 00:10:12,297
I think I understand the theory of what you're saying.

166
00:10:12,768 --> 00:10:16,762
But, emotionally, I find a cold drink
on a hot day more satisfying, so...

167
00:10:17,058 --> 00:10:18,294
Emotionally? Huh.

168
00:10:19,056 --> 00:10:23,101
I suppose when you're younger, emotions tend
to drive your decisions more than practicality.

169
00:10:23,683 --> 00:10:25,317
I'll get you something else. What would you like?

170
00:10:25,342 --> 00:10:27,623
Oh, no. Please, that's okay. The sentiment is enough.

171
00:10:29,265 --> 00:10:30,394
Sorry about that.

172
00:10:30,734 --> 00:10:35,527
I tend to look at things from a logical perspective
maybe because of all the time I spend doing research.

173
00:10:35,572 --> 00:10:36,837
You do a lot of research?

174
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:39,023
Are you some kind of scientist, then?

175
00:10:40,118 --> 00:10:42,034
I'm a cerebrophysiologist.

176
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:45,489
My primary area of study is AIM diffusion fields.

177
00:10:46,484 --> 00:10:47,464
Diffusion fields.

178
00:10:47,489 --> 00:10:52,109
Those are the weak spheres of power that Espers
continuously emit without being consciously aware of it?

179
00:10:52,207 --> 00:10:54,826
That's right. You've already learned about them in school?

180
00:10:55,492 --> 00:10:57,590
Uh... huh. Back during my first year.

181
00:11:05,946 --> 00:11:07,493
They told us the fields are so weak

182
00:11:07,518 --> 00:11:11,790
they can't be detected with human senses and
have to be measured using specialized devices.

183
00:11:13,165 --> 00:11:17,057
I'm especially interested in discovering
ways to harness and apply that power.

184
00:11:17,599 --> 00:11:19,821
Oh, does that mean...

185
00:11:20,008 --> 00:11:22,299
Do you know a lot about Esper abilities?

186
00:11:22,494 --> 00:11:24,405
Are you interested in something specific?

187
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:26,304
Well, yeah,

188
00:11:27,158 --> 00:11:30,561
Um... Is it possible that there's an ability

189
00:11:31,284 --> 00:11:33,040
that can negate other powers?

190
00:11:33,944 --> 00:11:36,465
Well, there are so many different abilities out there.

191
00:11:36,957 --> 00:11:39,602
Can you give me a clearer
example of what you're describing?

192
00:11:39,627 --> 00:11:42,883
Let's say someone was hit with an
electric shock and it had no effect.

193
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:44,808
An electric shock, huh?

194
00:11:45,379 --> 00:11:50,289
Maybe this person generated something to act as a
lightning rod and deflected the electrical current?

195
00:11:50,432 --> 00:11:53,735
It's something different than that.
I'm not really sure how to explain it.

196
00:11:54,673 --> 00:11:56,874
Is this person an acquaintance of yours?

197
00:11:58,332 --> 00:11:59,616
Oh! No!

198
00:11:59,968 --> 00:12:02,205
It's an urban legend my friends were talking about.

199
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,652
It's ridiculous. I shouldn't have said anything.

200
00:12:04,797 --> 00:12:06,385
An urban legend, huh?

201
00:12:06,835 --> 00:12:10,040
Is that the kind of thing children
are interested in these days?

202
00:12:10,065 --> 00:12:13,164
I know it sounds silly, but there
are quite a few of them going around.

203
00:12:13,537 --> 00:12:14,932
Y'know, like the Undresstress?

204
00:12:14,957 --> 00:12:15,919
Undresstress?

205
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:18,818
No, never mind. Forget I even mentioned it!

206
00:12:23,734 --> 00:12:25,864
Oh! I'm so sorry!

207
00:12:26,488 --> 00:12:27,696
No, don't worry about it.

208
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:29,640
It'll wash off easily enough.

209
00:12:31,445 --> 00:12:33,055
Can't you keep your clothes on?

210
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:42,876
Still no answer.

211
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:44,419
Why can't I get a hold of her?

212
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:47,476
Probably 'cause the Undresstress is attacking her!

213
00:12:47,501 --> 00:12:49,114
I'm not listening to that nonsense.

214
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:50,144
Look what I found.

215
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:52,657
This website has a ton of detailed information on it.

216
00:12:52,737 --> 00:12:53,983
And it's all about her.

217
00:12:54,263 --> 00:12:54,928
Let me see.

218
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,203
What is it? What does it say?

219
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:01,608
It's terrible.

220
00:13:02,182 --> 00:13:04,910
It says here the victims of the
Undresstress may try to hold out,

221
00:13:04,935 --> 00:13:07,792
but all eventually utter a final cry and are lost forever.

222
00:13:08,678 --> 00:13:10,332
This gets more absurd every second.

223
00:13:10,866 --> 00:13:12,033
It's just a dumb story.

224
00:13:12,058 --> 00:13:13,063
But, if you're that worried,

225
00:13:13,088 --> 00:13:17,296
remember that Sissy is the ultimate,
unstoppable shock princess, the Ace of Tokiwadai.

226
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:21,854
She's hardly going to be undone by some strange
woman just because she likes to undress in public.

227
00:13:22,657 --> 00:13:23,516
That's not all.

228
00:13:23,613 --> 00:13:26,557
I think something even more
terrifying could be happening here.

229
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:28,973
Now what are you going on about?

230
00:13:29,697 --> 00:13:32,134
What if the Undresstress is contagious somehow?

231
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:34,247
What? You mean like a disease?

232
00:13:34,998 --> 00:13:37,577
Maybe those who meet her become cursed the way she is.

233
00:13:38,167 --> 00:13:40,445
Maybe they become Undresstresses, too!

234
00:13:41,536 --> 00:13:44,306
Then Misaka will go around stripping for everybody!

235
00:13:44,635 --> 00:13:47,999
Oh, no. That can't happen. Not to my Sissy!

236
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:52,204
No! Don't do it, Sissy! You can't!

237
00:13:53,259 --> 00:13:55,215
Um, Shirai?

238
00:13:56,782 --> 00:13:59,520
Uiharu, you have to find a way to lift the curse!

239
00:13:59,684 --> 00:14:00,589
Right now!

240
00:14:00,726 --> 00:14:03,682
Please, don't get so worked up. You're hurting me!

241
00:14:03,707 --> 00:14:04,551
Yeah, remember?

242
00:14:04,776 --> 00:14:06,824
It's nothing but an urban legend, right?

243
00:14:10,829 --> 00:14:13,069
Sorry for inconveniencing you so much.

244
00:14:14,593 --> 00:14:16,919
Well, I've already come this far.

245
00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:20,828
There you go.

246
00:14:21,147 --> 00:14:22,314
Great. Thank you.

247
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:26,977
Oh, yes. Thank that young man for me, too, won't you?

248
00:14:27,513 --> 00:14:28,328
Young man?

249
00:14:28,688 --> 00:14:30,069
He's a friend of yours, right?

250
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:33,437
He could tell I was in trouble
and asked what he could do to help.

251
00:14:33,736 --> 00:14:35,121
Oh, did he?

252
00:14:36,322 --> 00:14:37,348
He's a good kid.

253
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:39,158
He's always butting in.

254
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:41,041
I think he just likes to play the hero.

255
00:14:41,348 --> 00:14:45,665
He barges into the middle of a situation,
babbling random stuff, and then disappears again.

256
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:46,521
It's annoying.

257
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:50,962
I don't know how to describe it, but
something about him rubs me the wrong way.

258
00:14:50,987 --> 00:14:52,207
He's headstrong and naive.

259
00:14:52,243 --> 00:14:53,911
It's like he stepped out of a fairy tale.

260
00:14:54,248 --> 00:14:55,165
He's always convinced that he's...

261
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:56,389
He sounds like a fun guy.

262
00:14:56,851 --> 00:14:59,424
So are you, you know, in love with this kid?

263
00:14:59,806 --> 00:15:01,387
What? You're crazy!

264
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:03,453
You know what I'm talking about.

265
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:06,916
That thing where you pretend to hate
someone but, really, you're nuts about them?

266
00:15:07,303 --> 00:15:08,418
What do they call it again?

267
00:15:09,207 --> 00:15:10,007
Let's see, here.

268
00:15:10,593 --> 00:15:12,613
Ah, yes. Playing hard to get.

269
00:15:12,832 --> 00:15:13,520
That's it.

270
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:15,951
That's impossible!

271
00:15:21,723 --> 00:15:23,890
What's happening? Why'd the alarm go off?

272
00:15:24,088 --> 00:15:25,683
No time to ask questions.

273
00:15:25,785 --> 00:15:26,995
Come on, let's go!

274
00:15:28,121 --> 00:15:28,781
Move.

275
00:15:34,211 --> 00:15:35,795
Thanks so much for helping me.

276
00:15:36,165 --> 00:15:37,042
Take care, okay?

277
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:41,948
'Kay. Drive safely!

278
00:15:45,509 --> 00:15:47,829
Come to think of it, who forgets
where they parked their car?

279
00:15:47,854 --> 00:15:50,191
There's definitely something off about her, all right.

280
00:15:54,361 --> 00:15:56,000
I'm exhausted.

281
00:15:56,425 --> 00:15:59,496
It's not like I did all that
much today. Why am I so worn out?

282
00:16:04,699 --> 00:16:06,551
This is his fault. He ruined my day.

283
00:16:06,746 --> 00:16:08,292
Next time I see him I swear I'll...

284
00:16:10,282 --> 00:16:11,262
They all broke!

285
00:16:12,634 --> 00:16:14,669
A week's worth of breakfast, just gone!

286
00:16:15,264 --> 00:16:16,219
This is awful.

287
00:16:17,057 --> 00:16:19,223
I waited in line for two hours!

288
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,930
I can't believe it! This is why you ran away earlier?

289
00:16:24,991 --> 00:16:28,373
You saddled me with some crazy
exhibitionist lady so you could go shopping?

290
00:16:28,417 --> 00:16:33,219
You know, for a student as poor as I am, getting groceries
while they're on sale can be a matter of life and death!

291
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,917
Not that somebody from Tokiwadai would understand!

292
00:16:35,942 --> 00:16:38,155
I didn't have an awesome day either, thank you!

293
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:41,818
Her skirt got dirty, so she stripped again,
and I had to wash it, and after all that.

294
00:16:41,843 --> 00:16:42,957
She told me I was playing...

295
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:46,029
What?

296
00:16:48,642 --> 00:16:51,232
Never mind. Just forget about it. You owe me a fight!

297
00:16:51,962 --> 00:16:54,087
I don't get why you're so eager for another fight.

298
00:16:54,112 --> 00:16:56,144
You've lost every one so far, haven't you?

299
00:16:56,747 --> 00:16:57,326
Shut up!

300
00:16:57,711 --> 00:17:01,154
I haven't been giving it everything
I've got yet, so I haven't lost anything.

301
00:17:01,301 --> 00:17:03,594
Okay. How are we going to resolve this?

302
00:17:03,738 --> 00:17:06,328
Huh? Well, it's a simple matter, really.

303
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,320
I just have to beat you up.

304
00:17:09,952 --> 00:17:12,436
Quit with the sighing, already. It's irritating me!

305
00:17:12,832 --> 00:17:13,900
All right, I give.

306
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:17,204
If it's the only thing that will satisfy you.

307
00:17:18,228 --> 00:17:19,841
I'm willing to take you on.

308
00:17:25,525 --> 00:17:27,547
Good. I'm glad you finally came around.

309
00:17:35,026 --> 00:17:37,613
We shouldn't bother anybody if we fight down here.

310
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,679
I'm ready when you are.

311
00:17:40,212 --> 00:17:41,141
So bring it on.

312
00:17:43,775 --> 00:17:45,275
You don't have to tell me twice.

313
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,561
I've been waiting a long time for this opportunity.

314
00:17:47,804 --> 00:17:49,037
All right, here we go!

315
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:57,709
Like I thought. Shocks don't work on you.

316
00:17:58,790 --> 00:17:59,494
Well, then...

317
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:09,196
Huh? What's that thing?

318
00:18:12,463 --> 00:18:13,755
Whoa! Hey, now.

319
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,530
Isn't it against the rules to use weapons?

320
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:17,822
Not if I made it using my ability.

321
00:18:20,745 --> 00:18:23,669
The iron sand vibrates, making it sort of like a chainsaw.

322
00:18:23,908 --> 00:18:26,204
Fair warning, it might hurt a bit if it touches you.

323
00:18:26,832 --> 00:18:28,112
I'm really not okay with this.

324
00:18:28,137 --> 00:18:29,929
Do you think you could put that thing away?

325
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:38,949
You can dodge and duck and run all you want.

326
00:18:39,024 --> 00:18:41,579
No matter how far you scamper, I can still reach you!

327
00:18:42,695 --> 00:18:43,517
It's longer!

328
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:47,290
Gotcha! Let's see if you can dodge this!

329
00:18:52,968 --> 00:18:55,252
He deflected the sand particles back at me!

330
00:18:56,113 --> 00:18:58,326
Oh, well. I anticipated that, too.

331
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:00,970
Well, looks like that's the match, huh?

332
00:19:01,173 --> 00:19:01,950
Oh, no.

333
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:04,055
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

334
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:09,394
Uh... oh. Even in the wind she can control it?

335
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:13,747
No matter how many times you try it's
going to end the same way it always has.

336
00:19:17,026 --> 00:19:19,317
I've got you! You can stop my currents in mid-air,

337
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:19,804
but...

338
00:19:21,428 --> 00:19:22,711
My electricity!

339
00:19:22,831 --> 00:19:24,141
It isn't even flowing!

340
00:19:24,721 --> 00:19:26,263
How does this guy do it?

341
00:19:36,877 --> 00:19:37,754
Uh...

342
00:19:46,945 --> 00:19:49,199
Yeah. I give up. You're the winner.

343
00:20:00,898 --> 00:20:03,358
Jerk! Don't screw with me!

344
00:20:05,715 --> 00:20:07,252
Take this fight seriously!

345
00:20:07,277 --> 00:20:09,419
I'm trying to help. You looked really scared!

346
00:20:09,582 --> 00:20:11,350
No I didn't. You don't scare me!

347
00:20:11,382 --> 00:20:12,342
Now you're lying!

348
00:20:12,914 --> 00:20:14,973
Your eyes got all red and watery like a baby.

349
00:20:14,998 --> 00:20:16,347
Then you flinched.

350
00:20:18,099 --> 00:20:19,163
Die!

351
00:20:21,332 --> 00:20:22,599
Get back here!

352
00:20:24,063 --> 00:20:27,240
Be careful! If that had hit me
directly, it could have killed me!

353
00:20:28,593 --> 00:20:30,426
You know full well it wouldn't have hurt you!

354
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:32,886
Whether it would have worked on me or not,

355
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:36,265
you've gotta be pretty sick to send an
attack like that without even hesitating.

356
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:40,048
I'll have you know I've never used that much
of my power to attack somebody before today!

357
00:20:40,262 --> 00:20:42,161
Then why start now? Why me?

358
00:20:42,186 --> 00:20:44,122
Quit running like a little girl and face me!

359
00:20:44,147 --> 00:20:46,459
Just leave me alone. I didn't ask for this!

360
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:52,999
Hey, I'm back.

361
00:20:53,706 --> 00:20:56,063
Huh? Kuroko isn't home yet?

362
00:21:00,832 --> 00:21:02,000
I'm exhausted.

363
00:21:04,026 --> 00:21:05,416
So, it's true then.

364
00:21:05,867 --> 00:21:08,474
Kuroko? Where are you hiding?

365
00:21:12,303 --> 00:21:13,868
You were stripping off all your clothing.

366
00:21:13,893 --> 00:21:16,896
Saten was right. You really
were cursed by the Undresstress!

367
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:17,705
Here!

368
00:21:17,926 --> 00:21:20,390
It's imperative that you put
these on your head immediately!

369
00:21:20,415 --> 00:21:22,153
Geez. What's gotten into you now?

370
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:24,417
This is the only way to lift the evil curse.

371
00:21:24,442 --> 00:21:26,462
The curse of the vile Undresstress!

372
00:21:28,013 --> 00:21:29,877
Undresstress, I banish you!

373
00:21:29,902 --> 00:21:31,498
Put those down! Have you gone insane?

374
00:21:32,128 --> 00:21:33,412
I banish you!

375
00:21:33,436 --> 00:21:35,027
I banish you!

376
00:21:35,194 --> 00:21:36,686
Curse, be gone!

377
00:21:41,641 --> 00:21:43,169
So, she's the Level 5.

378
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:44,886
I've heard so much about her.

379
00:21:45,954 --> 00:21:47,794
What a fascinating young girl.

380
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:34,915
I had fun today, and as an added
bonus, I get to do the preview.

381
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:39,554
Let's see. I think I'll accompany the preview
with some tasteful disrobing. Next time...

382
00:23:39,579 --> 00:23:40,666
Don't you dare!
