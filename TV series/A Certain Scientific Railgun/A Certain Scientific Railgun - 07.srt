1
00:00:04,913 --> 00:00:08,247
The attacks began a week ago and
they have been escalating ever since.

2
00:00:13,606 --> 00:00:18,711
It is a series of Graviton attacks, with each successive
incident the force and scale have both increased.

3
00:00:24,205 --> 00:00:27,497
We cannot find any pattern in the
times and locations of the attacks,

4
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:32,213
and after examining the psychometry of articles
left behind, we still do not have any leads.

5
00:00:32,763 --> 00:00:35,677
We are working with anti-skill
to prevent anymore casualties.

6
00:00:35,888 --> 00:00:39,856
We have increased security that we must do
everything we can to get this case solved.

7
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,747
Are you sure you're feeling okay?

8
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:30,180
You were up late again last night
investigating those serial attacks.

9
00:02:30,276 --> 00:02:32,168
It's the only thing I can think to do.

10
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,123
The search is still turning up nothing.

11
00:02:34,268 --> 00:02:37,294
For now, I'm just checking to make
sure we haven't overlooked anything.

12
00:02:37,589 --> 00:02:39,964
Well, it's great you're so committed to your work and all,

13
00:02:40,103 --> 00:02:41,956
but you shouldn't push yourself so hard.

14
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:45,131
Aw! Thank you, Sissy!

15
00:02:45,747 --> 00:02:48,413
It warms my heart to know you're so concerned about me.

16
00:02:48,555 --> 00:02:52,052
I think what would really help is if we
could sleep in the same bed together tonight.

17
00:02:52,664 --> 00:02:55,061
My fatigue would evaporate immediately!

18
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:58,196
Aw, man!

19
00:02:58,616 --> 00:03:01,015
Well, the least you can do is wait for me, Sissy.

20
00:03:01,398 --> 00:03:03,764
Really, must you always be so coy?

21
00:03:13,286 --> 00:03:18,374
AIM diffusion fields are localized
phenomena that occur only around Espers.

22
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:23,047
Of course, AIM is an acronym. It
stands for "An Involuntary Movement."

23
00:03:23,591 --> 00:03:29,124
An AIM diffusion field is a weak force that
Espers involuntarily emit around themselves.

24
00:03:29,388 --> 00:03:31,389
It can't be felt with the five senses.

25
00:03:31,414 --> 00:03:34,018
Without specialized equipment,
it can't be detected at all.

26
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:40,080
However, researchers into applications in this
field have been making remarkable progress recently.

27
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,138
Hey! What're you poking me for?

28
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,763
You want to do some shopping
at Seventh Mist on the way home?

29
00:03:45,788 --> 00:03:47,883
Yeah! Oh, I can't.

30
00:03:47,975 --> 00:03:49,742
I still have work to do for Judgment.

31
00:03:49,821 --> 00:03:52,038
You can blow that off for a bit, though, can't you?

32
00:03:52,063 --> 00:03:53,869
Just say we were out patrolling or something.

33
00:03:53,894 --> 00:03:54,788
That won't work.

34
00:03:54,813 --> 00:03:58,749
I really would love to go with you, but
solving this case just matters more right now.

35
00:03:59,596 --> 00:04:00,685
Oh. Okay.

36
00:04:10,676 --> 00:04:11,382
Hey.

37
00:04:15,369 --> 00:04:17,663
We need cash. You gonna lend us some more?

38
00:04:17,688 --> 00:04:19,388
What? I can't.

39
00:04:19,484 --> 00:04:22,830
I mean, I would, but you haven't paid
back what you already borrowed from me.

40
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:23,693
Huh?

41
00:04:29,332 --> 00:04:31,576
We told you we'd pay you back, didn't we?

42
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:33,783
Once we've got the dough.

43
00:04:33,808 --> 00:04:37,725
Don't you remember? You're giving us
loans, indefinitely and interest, free.

44
00:04:37,852 --> 00:04:39,163
That was the deal we had.

45
00:04:39,204 --> 00:04:40,933
Is this seriously all you've got?

46
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:42,124
Come on.

47
00:04:42,346 --> 00:04:44,754
Let's get going before Judgment shows up.

48
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:46,464
Nothin' to worry about there.

49
00:04:46,709 --> 00:04:49,497
They're too busy with those bombings
to have time for anything else.

50
00:04:52,486 --> 00:04:53,081
Damn it.

51
00:04:53,538 --> 00:04:55,044
He's right. They're useless.

52
00:04:56,237 --> 00:04:58,163
Judgment? Don't make me laugh.

53
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,949
This wouldn't be happening to me if they'd do their job.

54
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:04,901
But just wait.

55
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:14,053
Aw, geez!

56
00:05:14,078 --> 00:05:16,137
I wish we had just a little more to go on.

57
00:05:16,872 --> 00:05:18,295
Yeah, tell me about it.

58
00:05:18,497 --> 00:05:22,163
So far all we know is the suspect
is a Level 4 Esper or higher.

59
00:05:22,188 --> 00:05:24,105
We really need more information.

60
00:05:24,819 --> 00:05:25,573
Hm.

61
00:05:26,392 --> 00:05:29,299
And the databank isn't coming
up with a match to the ability.

62
00:05:30,278 --> 00:05:33,888
Maybe it's somebody who's had a very
sudden, dramatic increase in power.

63
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,195
No. No way.

64
00:05:35,346 --> 00:05:38,288
Over such a short period of
time? That would be impossible.

65
00:05:38,411 --> 00:05:39,993
Just wishful thinking.

66
00:05:40,747 --> 00:05:42,853
You're right. Something like that could never happen.

67
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:45,126
Let's keep at it.

68
00:05:45,497 --> 00:05:47,748
We'll go over the fragments left behind again.

69
00:05:48,254 --> 00:05:49,504
Yeah, good idea!

70
00:05:59,231 --> 00:06:00,001
Saten!

71
00:06:10,576 --> 00:06:12,068
Kuroko's so stressed.

72
00:06:12,176 --> 00:06:14,285
It must be just as hard on Uiharu.

73
00:06:14,671 --> 00:06:16,375
She's working so much!

74
00:06:16,769 --> 00:06:19,091
I asked if she wanted to go shopping with me today.

75
00:06:19,339 --> 00:06:20,600
Of course she said, "No."

76
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:24,497
Yeah. They don't really have a choice
until this mad bomber is captured.

77
00:06:26,555 --> 00:06:27,981
It all makes me feel...

78
00:06:28,385 --> 00:06:29,282
I don't know.

79
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,464
I feel so insignificant right now.

80
00:06:33,066 --> 00:06:34,407
Oh, how should I put it?

81
00:06:34,951 --> 00:06:38,539
Uiharu and Kuroko are doing so
much work for this Judgment case

82
00:06:38,691 --> 00:06:40,796
and obviously, you're in a league of your own.

83
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,392
And then there's me, and I'm just...

84
00:06:48,048 --> 00:06:49,776
Oh, sorry! Really!

85
00:06:49,986 --> 00:06:51,729
I'm not trying to throw a pity party!

86
00:06:52,316 --> 00:06:54,486
I just mean if I had an ability, too,

87
00:06:54,663 --> 00:06:56,838
it would really change my life, you know?

88
00:07:00,797 --> 00:07:05,642
Aw. If only I had a Level Upper or something,
then maybe I could be a Level 5 someday, too.

89
00:07:05,898 --> 00:07:07,070
What's a Level Upper?

90
00:07:07,872 --> 00:07:10,264
It's one of those urban legends I mentioned before.

91
00:07:10,788 --> 00:07:14,745
Apparently, it's a device that will
automatically upgrade your ability level for you.

92
00:07:17,726 --> 00:07:22,158
When we found out the "Undresstress" was real,
I started thinking maybe it could be real, too.

93
00:07:23,167 --> 00:07:24,802
But that's ridiculous, isn't it?

94
00:07:27,117 --> 00:07:30,412
Say... Let's all go together!

95
00:07:36,249 --> 00:07:38,882
You want me to go shopping with you, Sissy? Really?

96
00:07:39,163 --> 00:07:40,795
You and Uiharu are both off.

97
00:07:41,016 --> 00:07:44,388
I told Saten I thought it would be
fun for all of us to make a day of it.

98
00:07:44,413 --> 00:07:46,795
Oh. You said that, did you?

99
00:07:47,749 --> 00:07:51,144
Well, I appreciate the offer, but
I don't think I'll be able to go.

100
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:54,544
I still need to do a little bit more investigating.

101
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,891
Oh. Okay, then.

102
00:07:58,069 --> 00:07:59,065
Well, good luck.

103
00:08:00,359 --> 00:08:01,399
I'm going to sleep.

104
00:08:24,048 --> 00:08:26,197
A new world order is on its way.

105
00:08:33,622 --> 00:08:35,858
And this time, I'll be on top.

106
00:08:40,122 --> 00:08:42,111
It's a shame Shirai couldn't make it today.

107
00:08:42,452 --> 00:08:44,152
Oh, she's not coming at all?

108
00:08:44,288 --> 00:08:45,868
Apparently, she still has to work.

109
00:08:46,258 --> 00:08:48,571
Judgment has never done anything to help me.

110
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:51,455
Who needs them?

111
00:09:03,557 --> 00:09:05,065
Over here! Come on!

112
00:09:05,668 --> 00:09:07,628
So, are you looking for anything specific?

113
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,005
No, but I haven't really thought about it that much.

114
00:09:12,209 --> 00:09:14,286
U... i... ha... ru!

115
00:09:14,413 --> 00:09:15,669
Come look over here!

116
00:09:15,694 --> 00:09:17,418
Uh, at what exactly?

117
00:09:18,926 --> 00:09:19,697
See?

118
00:09:19,933 --> 00:09:21,422
These are great, aren't they?

119
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,483
No! Never, never, never!

120
00:09:23,853 --> 00:09:24,654
On me?

121
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:26,180
I couldn't get away with those, could I?

122
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:28,881
Think of how stylish and mature they'd look.

123
00:09:29,079 --> 00:09:31,685
You could show them off proudly
whenever I flip up your skirt.

124
00:09:33,163 --> 00:09:34,294
I don't want to show off.

125
00:09:34,587 --> 00:09:36,151
I don't want my skirt flipped up!

126
00:09:36,239 --> 00:09:37,462
Aw, that's too bad.

127
00:09:37,756 --> 00:09:38,859
Oh, hey!

128
00:09:39,128 --> 00:09:40,833
What are you in the market for today?

129
00:09:41,037 --> 00:09:43,396
Huh? Well, let's see.

130
00:09:43,575 --> 00:09:45,282
Maybe some new pajamas?

131
00:09:46,501 --> 00:09:48,334
In that case, let's head this way.

132
00:09:51,782 --> 00:09:53,670
They sure do have a lot of stuff here.

133
00:09:54,366 --> 00:09:56,616
But I haven't seen anything I like so far.

134
00:10:05,747 --> 00:10:07,294
Over here! These are adorable!

135
00:10:07,319 --> 00:10:08,663
Whoa. Hey, Uiharu.

136
00:10:08,747 --> 00:10:10,498
You've gotta check these pj's out.

137
00:10:10,723 --> 00:10:13,540
When was the last time you saw
anybody wearing something like that?

138
00:10:14,529 --> 00:10:17,804
I had something that looked very similar
back when I was in elementary school.

139
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:20,131
But that was a while ago.

140
00:10:20,156 --> 00:10:21,882
Well, yeah, of course.

141
00:10:21,907 --> 00:10:24,618
Now that we're in middle school,
we can't wear this type of thing.

142
00:10:25,503 --> 00:10:26,357
Obviously.

143
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:31,305
Well, I think I'm gonna look at swimsuits.

144
00:10:31,522 --> 00:10:32,413
Yeah, all right.

145
00:10:32,438 --> 00:10:34,017
I'm pretty sure they were back this way.

146
00:10:34,209 --> 00:10:34,612
Cool.

147
00:10:37,199 --> 00:10:38,472
Who cares, anyway?

148
00:10:38,544 --> 00:10:40,060
They're just pajamas, right?

149
00:10:40,143 --> 00:10:42,015
It's not like anyone else will see them.

150
00:10:42,872 --> 00:10:44,546
How about this one? Isn't it pretty?

151
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,049
All right, now's my chance.

152
00:10:46,122 --> 00:10:48,242
Nobody will notice if I take a quick look.

153
00:10:50,455 --> 00:10:51,197
Yoink!

154
00:10:52,104 --> 00:10:53,765
Uh, what are you doing, Zapper?

155
00:10:56,927 --> 00:10:58,674
I'm shopping with friends.

156
00:10:58,699 --> 00:10:59,858
What are you doing here?

157
00:10:59,883 --> 00:11:01,580
What, am I not allowed to be here?

158
00:11:01,726 --> 00:11:02,853
Big Brother!

159
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:09,234
You're with the nice lady from Tokiwadai!

160
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:13,109
Oh! The girl with the bag.

161
00:11:14,149 --> 00:11:16,463
I didn't realize you had a younger sister.

162
00:11:16,764 --> 00:11:18,055
Yeah, well, I don't.

163
00:11:18,274 --> 00:11:21,413
This little girl just asked me
to help her find a clothing store.

164
00:11:21,554 --> 00:11:23,455
Seems she's nicknamed me, Big Brother.

165
00:11:23,577 --> 00:11:26,949
Now we're here! Big Brother picked out a perfect store!

166
00:11:27,072 --> 00:11:29,563
I'm gonna dress up real pretty and fancy!

167
00:11:29,825 --> 00:11:32,117
And I'll look just like the grown-ups on TV!

168
00:11:32,329 --> 00:11:33,478
You will, will you?

169
00:11:33,805 --> 00:11:36,531
Well, I think you already look pretty snazzy this way.

170
00:11:37,101 --> 00:11:39,550
Unlike a certain somebody I happen to know.

171
00:11:39,997 --> 00:11:41,187
You want a piece of me?

172
00:11:41,522 --> 00:11:44,205
I'm perfectly happy to settle
what we started the other day.

173
00:11:44,364 --> 00:11:46,295
Huh? You're still worked up?

174
00:11:46,346 --> 00:11:48,329
Is that the only thing you ever think about?

175
00:11:50,515 --> 00:11:51,459
Here? Really?

176
00:11:51,785 --> 00:11:54,565
You actually want to start a
fight in front of all these people?

177
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:57,758
Hey, hey!

178
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,388
I wanna look there!

179
00:11:59,428 --> 00:12:01,040
Oh? Well, let's go.

180
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:03,872
Bye... bye, nice lady!

181
00:12:04,075 --> 00:12:05,071
See you!

182
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:16,026
What's up?

183
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:17,862
Is something wrong, Misaka?

184
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,912
No. It's nothing.

185
00:12:29,361 --> 00:12:31,477
That guy always makes me lose my temper.

186
00:12:31,788 --> 00:12:33,321
Why does he do that to me?

187
00:12:36,199 --> 00:12:37,033
Gekota!

188
00:12:39,047 --> 00:12:40,456
Never mind. It's not.

189
00:12:42,778 --> 00:12:44,595
It doesn't look much like him at all.

190
00:12:54,814 --> 00:12:56,068
I'm starting to wonder.

191
00:12:56,207 --> 00:12:59,262
Could we have two different
suspects? Both with the same M.O.?

192
00:13:00,645 --> 00:13:01,653
Don't be silly.

193
00:13:02,195 --> 00:13:03,600
I'm grasping at straws.

194
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:06,357
I just can't see any connection
between all of the attacks.

195
00:13:06,497 --> 00:13:10,480
If we don't figure this out soon, we'll have
another victim on our hands-maybe more than one.

196
00:13:11,175 --> 00:13:13,466
If only we had at least one solid lead.

197
00:13:13,546 --> 00:13:15,699
Nine of our colleagues have been hurt already.

198
00:13:18,154 --> 00:13:19,117
Nine?

199
00:13:20,455 --> 00:13:21,601
What are you thinking?

200
00:13:21,872 --> 00:13:23,939
That seems like an awful lot, don't you think?

201
00:13:25,808 --> 00:13:27,267
Maybe we're the targets!

202
00:13:30,565 --> 00:13:32,950
Accelerated gravitons have been detected!

203
00:13:36,494 --> 00:13:38,415
Uiharu. That's your phone, isn't it?

204
00:13:38,788 --> 00:13:40,187
Oh. Yeah, it is.

205
00:13:41,185 --> 00:13:42,025
Yes, this is Ui...

206
00:13:42,074 --> 00:13:42,681
Uiharu!

207
00:13:43,538 --> 00:13:45,326
Update on the graviton attacks.

208
00:13:46,305 --> 00:13:50,172
The surveillance satellite has picked
up an explosive acceleration of gravitons.

209
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,198
Where is it happening?

210
00:13:52,223 --> 00:13:56,941
Antiskill officers in the area are responding
immediately, but we need you to get back here at once!

211
00:13:57,021 --> 00:13:59,102
Wait, Kuroko. Where is the attack?

212
00:13:59,127 --> 00:14:02,305
A clothing store called Seventh
Mist in the Seventh School District.

213
00:14:04,738 --> 00:14:06,744
Seventh Mist clothing store?

214
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:09,710
That's perfect, then. That's where I am right now.

215
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:11,974
I'll start the emergency evacuation!

216
00:14:12,819 --> 00:14:13,696
Uiharu!

217
00:14:13,985 --> 00:14:15,549
Hello? Are you there?

218
00:14:16,442 --> 00:14:17,988
What does she think she's doing?

219
00:14:18,127 --> 00:14:19,903
What's going on? What did she say?

220
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:26,250
Please listen and don't panic.

221
00:14:26,405 --> 00:14:28,682
We know where the attacker's next target is.

222
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:29,993
We're standing in it.

223
00:14:30,121 --> 00:14:32,163
Wha... What did you say?

224
00:14:32,437 --> 00:14:33,330
Here's the plan.

225
00:14:33,355 --> 00:14:36,301
I want you to start helping with the evacuation, Misaka.

226
00:14:36,436 --> 00:14:37,288
Yeah. Sure thing.

227
00:14:37,313 --> 00:14:39,623
And Saten-you get to safety, okay?

228
00:14:42,133 --> 00:14:43,665
You'll be careful, too, won't you?

229
00:14:48,853 --> 00:14:50,686
He's got his next target, all right.

230
00:14:52,136 --> 00:14:53,638
Attention all customers.

231
00:14:53,742 --> 00:14:57,301
We are experiencing an electrical
malfunction inside the store.

232
00:14:57,603 --> 00:15:00,930
We sincerely apologize for any
inconvenience this might cause,

233
00:15:00,955 --> 00:15:03,559
<i>but we must immediately suspend business for the day.</i>

234
00:15:03,872 --> 00:15:06,921
<i>Please follow the clerks'
instructions to the nearest exit.</i>

235
00:15:07,374 --> 00:15:11,921
<i>Again, we sincerely apologize for any
inconvenience, but we must immediately suspend business.</i>

236
00:15:11,955 --> 00:15:12,742
Zapper!

237
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:15,674
Have you seen that little girl?

238
00:15:15,872 --> 00:15:17,955
Huh? I thought she was with you!

239
00:15:17,984 --> 00:15:19,426
I can't find her anywhere.

240
00:15:20,101 --> 00:15:21,705
She could still be inside the store.

241
00:15:21,788 --> 00:15:22,992
What is she doing?

242
00:15:23,444 --> 00:15:23,865
Hey!

243
00:15:32,274 --> 00:15:33,155
Uiharu!

244
00:15:33,395 --> 00:15:34,895
Everyone has been evacuated.

245
00:15:35,332 --> 00:15:37,556
Listen to me. You need to get out of there right now!

246
00:15:38,739 --> 00:15:42,196
The only human casualties in the
past attacks were Judgment members.

247
00:15:42,245 --> 00:15:45,944
The suspect's actual target is any
Judgment officer who's in the area!

248
00:15:46,151 --> 00:15:49,257
And that means that this time
the target is going to be you!

249
00:15:51,429 --> 00:15:52,770
Hey there, lady!

250
00:16:01,351 --> 00:16:02,139
Is that...?

251
00:16:03,081 --> 00:16:06,998
A strange man wearing glasses asked me to
come over and give this to you as a present.

252
00:16:07,102 --> 00:16:07,570
Here!

253
00:16:13,185 --> 00:16:15,538
Get down right now! That thing is a bomb!

254
00:16:15,563 --> 00:16:16,836
I'll railgun it out of here!

255
00:16:17,629 --> 00:16:18,391
Uh... oh!

256
00:16:25,788 --> 00:16:26,970
What was that?

257
00:16:26,994 --> 00:16:27,753
An explosion!

258
00:16:29,681 --> 00:16:31,693
It must be one of those serial bombings!

259
00:16:31,846 --> 00:16:34,055
It looked like there were still people inside!

260
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,072
I think I saw a girl from Judgment.

261
00:16:36,104 --> 00:16:37,455
Everybody! Stand back!

262
00:16:37,701 --> 00:16:40,205
Get back now, people! Clear the area!

263
00:16:42,557 --> 00:16:43,324
Awesome!

264
00:16:43,705 --> 00:16:45,969
That was perfect! Perfect!

265
00:16:46,168 --> 00:16:49,204
I'm controlling stronger and stronger power every time!

266
00:16:52,169 --> 00:16:55,576
I'm getting close. A few more
attacks and I should be ready.

267
00:16:56,305 --> 00:16:59,413
I'll take on Judgment and those
punks at school along with 'em.

268
00:16:59,497 --> 00:17:01,264
I'll blow every last one...

269
00:17:11,204 --> 00:17:13,140
What the... What happened?

270
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:14,292
Hi!

271
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:16,740
I assume you know what this is about.

272
00:17:16,997 --> 00:17:19,417
I'm right, aren't I? Mister Mad Bomber?

273
00:17:20,274 --> 00:17:20,901
-No.

274
00:17:21,071 --> 00:17:23,626
I have no idea what you're talking about, really.

275
00:17:23,651 --> 00:17:27,082
Well, there is a lot of property
damage. I'll give you that.

276
00:17:27,431 --> 00:17:28,608
But too bad for you.

277
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:30,609
There wasn't a single causality.

278
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:33,373
Nobody suffered even so much as a scratch.

279
00:17:33,649 --> 00:17:37,536
No! That's impossible! I was using the maximum power.

280
00:17:41,011 --> 00:17:44,091
Well, I mean, it looked like
a huge explosion from outside.

281
00:17:44,116 --> 00:17:47,984
So, I seriously doubt anybody still
in the store could have survived it.

282
00:17:57,774 --> 00:17:58,917
It's Railgun.

283
00:18:02,747 --> 00:18:04,680
The great Ace of Tokiwadai.

284
00:18:04,931 --> 00:18:06,090
Just my luck.

285
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:08,514
It's always like this.

286
00:18:09,127 --> 00:18:10,326
No matter what I do.

287
00:18:11,012 --> 00:18:14,337
People are always beating me down, but I'm gonna stop it.

288
00:18:15,263 --> 00:18:16,531
I'll kill you all.

289
00:18:17,162 --> 00:18:19,224
It's people like you who are the problem.

290
00:18:19,372 --> 00:18:21,075
And Judgment is the same way!

291
00:18:21,497 --> 00:18:24,831
And anyone who has power! All you ever do is abuse it!

292
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:29,520
Power? Power, you say?

293
00:18:31,785 --> 00:18:33,095
I'll show ya power.

294
00:18:33,567 --> 00:18:34,200
Ahh!

295
00:18:41,899 --> 00:18:42,590
You fool.

296
00:18:50,255 --> 00:18:52,434
That punch was the least that you deserved.

297
00:18:53,077 --> 00:18:56,603
You use other people's power as
an excuse for your own weakness.

298
00:18:56,959 --> 00:18:59,219
There's almost nothing more pathetic than that.

299
00:18:59,913 --> 00:19:02,761
Don't you realize even the great Railgun,

300
00:19:02,853 --> 00:19:05,296
Ace of Tokiwadai, started out at Level 1.

301
00:19:05,945 --> 00:19:08,539
She didn't become a Level 5 because of some fluke.

302
00:19:08,716 --> 00:19:11,017
She worked hard for it every step of the way.

303
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:15,981
You know, even if she was a Level 1 instead of a Level 5,

304
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:19,628
I have a feeling she still would
have been able to get the best of you.

305
00:19:39,867 --> 00:19:40,811
There you are!

306
00:19:43,565 --> 00:19:45,268
Oh! I was so worried about you!

307
00:19:45,639 --> 00:19:46,841
I know. I'm sorry.

308
00:19:47,252 --> 00:19:49,415
But thanks to Misaka, here we are.

309
00:19:49,464 --> 00:19:51,380
All in one piece! See?

310
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:54,546
The lady from Tokiwadai saved us just in time!

311
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:55,882
Yeah!

312
00:19:56,283 --> 00:19:57,880
She was pretty amazing, huh?

313
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:58,534
Yeah!

314
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:00,848
There's something strange about it, though.

315
00:20:01,167 --> 00:20:04,390
The place where they were standing
is the only spot left unharmed.

316
00:20:04,821 --> 00:20:07,586
I don't know how Sissy's ability could have this effect.

317
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:17,507
Hey! There she is!

318
00:20:18,922 --> 00:20:22,048
I have to admit, you really
outdid yourself this time, Sissy!

319
00:20:22,073 --> 00:20:23,764
Thank you so much for everything!

320
00:20:23,843 --> 00:20:24,375
Huh?

321
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:25,964
Oh. Yeah.

322
00:20:26,941 --> 00:20:31,415
I know! Let me be your personal slave
for a day. I'll do anything you want me to!

323
00:20:32,097 --> 00:20:35,650
I could wash your back for you or give you a nice massage.

324
00:20:35,931 --> 00:20:37,333
What is your bidding, Sissy?

325
00:20:37,358 --> 00:20:37,970
I'll pass.

326
00:20:38,281 --> 00:20:39,972
That sounds more like what you want.

327
00:20:40,218 --> 00:20:41,243
Thanks anyway.

328
00:20:41,268 --> 00:20:42,972
Aw, come on!

329
00:20:42,997 --> 00:20:45,517
Just a short massage, then! Please!

330
00:22:19,306 --> 00:22:20,796
I don't deserve the credit.

331
00:22:20,987 --> 00:22:23,481
My railgun wouldn't have made it in time back there.

332
00:22:34,951 --> 00:22:37,876
It wasn't me who saved Uiharu and that little girl.

333
00:22:41,661 --> 00:22:42,590
It was him.

334
00:22:47,357 --> 00:22:48,199
An ambush?

335
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:50,006
You angry?

336
00:22:50,375 --> 00:22:50,780
Huh?

337
00:22:51,335 --> 00:22:55,608
Everybody seems to think I'm the one who
saved those guys from the graviton explosion.

338
00:22:57,038 --> 00:22:58,960
If you come forward, you'll be a hero.

339
00:22:59,125 --> 00:23:01,234
Huh? What are you talking about?

340
00:23:02,722 --> 00:23:04,442
Everybody got out of it all right.

341
00:23:04,632 --> 00:23:06,419
I don't really see a problem. Do you?

342
00:23:06,907 --> 00:23:09,145
So what difference does it make who saved them?

343
00:23:17,846 --> 00:23:19,748
Stop acting so cool!

344
00:23:22,557 --> 00:23:24,807
Why does he always have to play the hero?

345
00:23:24,978 --> 00:23:27,109
And why does he only do it in front of me?

346
00:23:28,129 --> 00:23:30,049
It's driving me crazy!

347
00:23:31,538 --> 00:23:32,705
It's always the same thing.

348
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:33,980
That guy really ticks me off!

349
00:23:34,005 --> 00:23:35,889
You should calm down, Sissy. You're turning red.

350
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:36,476
Next time...

351
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,673
I'm not turning red!

352
00:23:37,713 --> 00:23:38,649
Ooh, bright red!

353
00:23:38,674 --> 00:23:40,277
Your face is burning my eyes!
