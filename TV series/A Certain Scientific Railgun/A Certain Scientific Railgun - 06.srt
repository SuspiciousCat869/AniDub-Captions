1
00:00:16,724 --> 00:00:17,765
That was an odd noise.

2
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:19,391
What was that? A firecracker?

3
00:00:19,454 --> 00:00:20,344
It startled me.

4
00:00:20,368 --> 00:00:20,873
Yeah.

5
00:01:54,561 --> 00:01:55,981
There was another incident?

6
00:01:56,006 --> 00:01:57,871
Yes, it was the fifth one so far.

7
00:01:58,015 --> 00:02:01,248
Luckily the explosion was
relatively small, and no one was hurt.

8
00:02:01,916 --> 00:02:02,796
Even so...

9
00:02:04,885 --> 00:02:07,835
Even so, if it's just a prank, it's not a very funny one.

10
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,289
So, have any leads so far?

11
00:02:10,314 --> 00:02:13,562
Well, it's not much, but we finally
got something to go on yesterday.

12
00:02:13,745 --> 00:02:16,812
Tell me, Sissy, do you know about gravitons at all?

13
00:02:17,094 --> 00:02:18,155
Gravitons.

14
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,427
Um, those are gravity particles, right?

15
00:02:21,611 --> 00:02:22,637
Yes, that's right.

16
00:02:22,662 --> 00:02:26,323
In each of the attacks, the satellite
detected a sharp spike in gravitons

17
00:02:26,348 --> 00:02:28,363
immediately before the explosion occurred.

18
00:02:29,246 --> 00:02:33,445
The speed of the gravitons was accelerated
explosively using an aluminum base,

19
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,604
so they popped out into the surrounding area.

20
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:38,447
Thus, the aluminum was transformed into a bomb

21
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:39,858
as far as we can tell.

22
00:02:40,023 --> 00:02:40,738
Hm.

23
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:42,828
Why use aluminum, though?

24
00:02:42,888 --> 00:02:43,642
Who knows?

25
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:44,721
Well, shouldn't you?

26
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:49,199
Anyway, at least this indicates it
was the work of an Esper, doesn't it?

27
00:02:49,342 --> 00:02:52,622
Just search through Academy City's
databank, and you should have the guy.

28
00:02:53,086 --> 00:02:55,971
The data bank registers all of the students' ability info.

29
00:02:57,468 --> 00:02:59,773
Of course. That was the first place we turned to.

30
00:03:00,243 --> 00:03:02,745
The corresponding ability is called Synchrotron.

31
00:03:02,958 --> 00:03:06,725
We found only one Esper whose power
could be used to make aluminum explode.

32
00:03:06,914 --> 00:03:08,646
It was a Level 4 student.

33
00:03:09,131 --> 00:03:11,733
That's simple. This person must be the suspect.

34
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:13,844
Except the thing is, she has an alibi.

35
00:03:13,893 --> 00:03:15,042
It's solid, too.

36
00:03:15,067 --> 00:03:16,545
The girl has been in the hospital.

37
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:19,842
So, there's no way she could have
orchestrated any of the attacks.

38
00:03:20,145 --> 00:03:21,265
So, that's ruled out.

39
00:03:21,344 --> 00:03:23,067
The inquiry's reached a dead-end, then?

40
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:24,604
I'd say so.

41
00:03:24,661 --> 00:03:27,422
I can't believe there would be
such an oversight in the databank.

42
00:03:27,685 --> 00:03:29,702
Oh. Well, maybe...

43
00:03:30,081 --> 00:03:32,299
Maybe there's an unregistered Esper out there

44
00:03:32,349 --> 00:03:33,094
or something.

45
00:03:33,292 --> 00:03:33,936
Hm...

46
00:03:34,735 --> 00:03:35,397
So,

47
00:03:35,421 --> 00:03:37,360
I think I should join in on the search for this criminal.

48
00:03:37,385 --> 00:03:38,941
No, absolutely not.

49
00:03:39,642 --> 00:03:40,793
I know how you think.

50
00:03:41,025 --> 00:03:41,745
Let's see.

51
00:03:42,156 --> 00:03:44,661
"This could be fun, facing a new opponent.

52
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,417
Yes, I'd like the chance to pit my powers against his.

53
00:03:47,548 --> 00:03:50,048
That's exactly what you were just thinking, wasn't it?

54
00:03:50,073 --> 00:03:50,672
Don't lie.

55
00:03:50,696 --> 00:03:52,073
No. I would never think that.

56
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:54,054
Don't you know that you can't fool me?

57
00:03:54,147 --> 00:03:55,768
I can see right through you.

58
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:57,459
Come on, now.

59
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,626
It's like I've told you over and over.

60
00:03:59,651 --> 00:04:01,713
Remember that you're a civilian, Sissy,

61
00:04:01,895 --> 00:04:03,150
and maintaining the peace of the city...

62
00:04:03,182 --> 00:04:05,902
It is a job for Judgment or Antiskill, and nobody else."

63
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:06,645
I know.

64
00:04:06,891 --> 00:04:08,002
You've told me that enough.

65
00:04:08,027 --> 00:04:09,319
If you think I serve in Judgment

66
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:11,339
because I get a kick out of this sort of thing,

67
00:04:11,364 --> 00:04:12,683
you're sadly mistaken.

68
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:15,955
Now, look. That's not what I was saying!

69
00:04:16,223 --> 00:04:17,066
Listen to me.

70
00:04:17,155 --> 00:04:19,148
I need you to make some promises now.

71
00:04:19,557 --> 00:04:21,883
First one, that you will not go recklessly

72
00:04:21,908 --> 00:04:23,558
poking your nose into this case.

73
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:25,016
Is this really necessary?

74
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:25,942
I don't think that you're...

75
00:04:25,967 --> 00:04:29,209
And second, in the unlikely
event that you do become involved,

76
00:04:29,353 --> 00:04:30,867
you will not charge into a fight,

77
00:04:30,919 --> 00:04:32,995
but wait for Judgment to arrive on the scene.

78
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:33,579
Hey, now.

79
00:04:33,603 --> 00:04:35,515
I always take care of things before you guys show...

80
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:38,289
And third, you must not wear shorts under your skirt.

81
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:40,439
What's that got to do with anything?

82
00:04:40,539 --> 00:04:42,615
It may not deal directly with this issue,

83
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:46,267
but I wanted to use this opportunity
to help you elevate your sense of style.

84
00:04:46,307 --> 00:04:47,807
You must remember, Sissy,

85
00:04:47,832 --> 00:04:49,282
that as the Ace of Tokiwadai,

86
00:04:49,307 --> 00:04:50,849
you have an image to uphold.

87
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:51,767
You still seem to

88
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,432
lack the self awareness necessary to be...

89
00:04:53,457 --> 00:04:54,807
This is totally off-topic!

90
00:04:54,855 --> 00:04:56,247
No. Please listen to me.

91
00:04:56,381 --> 00:04:57,786
If you were more self-aware,

92
00:04:57,819 --> 00:04:59,868
you would realize that the Ace should not sleep

93
00:04:59,893 --> 00:05:02,721
with a teddy bear nor bathe with a strange frog doll.

94
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:04,329
It's about time for you

95
00:05:04,353 --> 00:05:06,249
to let go of those childish things.

96
00:05:06,484 --> 00:05:07,208
And there's more.

97
00:05:07,242 --> 00:05:10,114
For instance, those cutesy pajamas you insist on wearing.

98
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:12,328
I mean, you are the third ranked Level 5 Esper...

99
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:14,440
Who do you think you are?

100
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:17,074
Why should I ever listen to you?

101
00:05:17,799 --> 00:05:19,109
Oh. I see.

102
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:21,212
Well, what do you think?

103
00:05:21,377 --> 00:05:22,985
Uh, well, maybe...

104
00:05:23,447 --> 00:05:25,281
Could you sit down, if that's okay?

105
00:05:25,362 --> 00:05:26,488
I think it'll help.

106
00:05:33,149 --> 00:05:34,275
Here's my theory.

107
00:05:34,574 --> 00:05:38,676
I think Shirai means well and her concern
is keeping you safe and out of danger.

108
00:05:39,157 --> 00:05:40,324
Out of danger?

109
00:05:40,543 --> 00:05:42,626
Like with these graviton attacks we've had.

110
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:45,044
Oh. Is that their formal name now?

111
00:05:45,332 --> 00:05:50,281
At first, they were just put into empty tin
cans or garbage bins, but the suspect has evolved.

112
00:05:50,594 --> 00:05:54,984
The latest bombs were put into stuffed animals
or other toys to make them less suspicious.

113
00:05:55,373 --> 00:05:57,095
Who would do that? It's awful.

114
00:05:57,214 --> 00:05:59,411
You can see how serious it is now

115
00:05:59,678 --> 00:06:02,594
and why Shirai might be a bit concerned about you helping.

116
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:03,808
Thank you for waiting.

117
00:06:04,953 --> 00:06:06,619
One fruit parfait, as ordered.

118
00:06:08,104 --> 00:06:10,296
Wow! Finally!

119
00:06:10,999 --> 00:06:12,252
I am so hungry!

120
00:06:12,394 --> 00:06:14,760
U... i... ha... ru!

121
00:06:15,813 --> 00:06:17,486
Oh! Hello, Shirai.

122
00:06:19,328 --> 00:06:22,566
Trying to duck your responsibility
by lounging around here?

123
00:06:22,678 --> 00:06:24,812
Well? Are you ready to go on patrol?

124
00:06:24,837 --> 00:06:25,963
Of course.

125
00:06:26,557 --> 00:06:28,359
Oh! But, uh, my parfait.

126
00:06:28,384 --> 00:06:30,129
Uh... Aw, just a bite? Please don't...

127
00:06:30,154 --> 00:06:32,577
I asked Uiharu to join me here to have a snack.

128
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:33,426
Hm?

129
00:06:33,617 --> 00:06:35,617
If that's a problem, then you should talk to me.

130
00:06:35,832 --> 00:06:37,368
It's nothing to do with you.

131
00:06:37,465 --> 00:06:39,781
This is exclusively a Judgment matter.

132
00:06:39,806 --> 00:06:42,222
So, we civilians should butt out, is that it?

133
00:06:42,806 --> 00:06:44,881
What more do you want from me, Sissy?

134
00:06:44,906 --> 00:06:46,387
Like I've already explained,

135
00:06:46,412 --> 00:06:47,662
whatever you want to imagine,

136
00:06:47,712 --> 00:06:50,047
Judgment work isn't exactly a walk in the park.

137
00:06:50,072 --> 00:06:50,690
Wha...?

138
00:06:50,715 --> 00:06:53,333
Ah, my parfait! Please, just one bite!

139
00:06:53,928 --> 00:06:55,613
She is so condescending!

140
00:06:55,721 --> 00:06:58,204
All I hear is "Judgment this" and "Judgment that."

141
00:06:58,602 --> 00:07:02,506
I'd be more impressed by them if they
showed up before I'd taken care of everything.

142
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,199
Well, whatever.

143
00:07:12,523 --> 00:07:13,821
I'll give it to her later.

144
00:07:13,886 --> 00:07:15,623
What are you just standing around for?

145
00:07:16,864 --> 00:07:18,485
Uh, sorry.

146
00:07:19,517 --> 00:07:20,422
You mean me?

147
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:22,940
Do I have it wrong? Are you not my backup?

148
00:07:23,117 --> 00:07:24,408
Your backup? What?

149
00:07:25,929 --> 00:07:28,114
Oh! No.

150
00:07:28,368 --> 00:07:31,429
You see, funny story, one of my friends just left this...

151
00:07:31,454 --> 00:07:33,388
Stop blabbering and put on your armband.

152
00:07:33,413 --> 00:07:34,721
We need to go! Come with me.

153
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:35,856
What? Where are we going?

154
00:07:36,409 --> 00:07:38,399
To do our jobs, obviously.

155
00:07:38,795 --> 00:07:40,846
Oh. Have you not heard yet?

156
00:07:40,923 --> 00:07:43,436
To do our jobs? That means I...

157
00:07:44,932 --> 00:07:47,456
Hey. You don't know what's going on, do you?

158
00:07:48,015 --> 00:07:50,043
Come to think of it, I don't know your face.

159
00:07:50,495 --> 00:07:52,202
Are you one of the new recruits?

160
00:07:52,845 --> 00:07:53,249
Hm...

161
00:07:54,378 --> 00:07:55,927
Yes! I'm Misaka,

162
00:07:55,952 --> 00:07:57,308
and this is my first day!

163
00:07:57,465 --> 00:07:58,348
Misaka.

164
00:07:58,925 --> 00:08:01,592
You know, I think I've heard that somewhere before.

165
00:08:01,617 --> 00:08:03,825
I'm sorry, but I don't know your name.

166
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:06,595
I'm Mii Konori of the 177th Branch.

167
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,119
Good afternoon, Konori.

168
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,410
Nice to meet you!

169
00:08:09,435 --> 00:08:11,048
Oh. Yes. Same to you.

170
00:08:11,137 --> 00:08:14,773
I'll show her that a civilian is
perfectly capable of doing Judgment work.

171
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:16,773
They can throw whatever they want at me.

172
00:08:16,798 --> 00:08:17,569
I'll take it!

173
00:08:19,384 --> 00:08:19,755
Here.

174
00:08:21,684 --> 00:08:23,235
What is that thing?

175
00:08:23,357 --> 00:08:26,227
What is this? It's a broom, obviously.

176
00:08:26,515 --> 00:08:27,040
Oh.

177
00:08:27,442 --> 00:08:29,024
We're here to tidy this place up.

178
00:08:30,113 --> 00:08:31,321
Uh, really?

179
00:08:32,005 --> 00:08:34,505
It's just, well, you know.

180
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:36,083
I'm in Judgment and all.

181
00:08:36,108 --> 00:08:38,474
Exactly. Students throw their litter about,

182
00:08:38,499 --> 00:08:40,705
and we in Judgment have to pick up after them.

183
00:08:41,004 --> 00:08:42,504
Didn't you learn that in your training?

184
00:08:42,529 --> 00:08:44,237
Eh... Oh!

185
00:08:44,262 --> 00:08:45,804
Yes, I remember that now!

186
00:08:53,877 --> 00:08:55,341
This is what Judgment does?

187
00:08:55,366 --> 00:08:56,730
You've got to be kidding me.

188
00:08:59,825 --> 00:09:01,783
Hey, you just threw trash on the ground!

189
00:09:01,847 --> 00:09:03,532
Oh. You can get this, too.

190
00:09:08,406 --> 00:09:10,586
You little punk! Come back here, right now!

191
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:14,146
Huh. You got what you deserved.

192
00:09:14,194 --> 00:09:14,985
Now throw...

193
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:18,334
Eh... Huh? Uh...

194
00:09:20,441 --> 00:09:21,536
Seriously?

195
00:09:22,134 --> 00:09:26,115
I can't believe anybody would be
careless enough to leave their armband here.

196
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,297
Well, what did they say?

197
00:09:29,932 --> 00:09:30,710
No luck.

198
00:09:30,933 --> 00:09:34,626
No one saw anything matching its
description, and nothing's been turned in.

199
00:09:35,214 --> 00:09:36,039
I'm sorry.

200
00:09:36,277 --> 00:09:37,874
What am I going to do with you?

201
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:40,177
You'll have to submit an official report.

202
00:09:40,217 --> 00:09:42,482
But, for now, let's go back to the branch office a...

203
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:51,391
What's the matter?

204
00:09:53,605 --> 00:09:55,036
Are you lost, sweetie?

205
00:09:57,403 --> 00:09:58,662
What were you thinking?

206
00:09:58,751 --> 00:10:00,954
You can't get trigger-happy with your powers.

207
00:10:01,322 --> 00:10:02,076
Yeah, but...

208
00:10:02,162 --> 00:10:03,513
"But" nothing Misaka.

209
00:10:03,688 --> 00:10:05,586
The use of your ability is one thing.

210
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:07,668
Guarding the safety of the city is another.

211
00:10:07,962 --> 00:10:09,995
Uh... Oh, yeah.

212
00:10:10,052 --> 00:10:11,449
I think I remember now.

213
00:10:11,474 --> 00:10:12,547
That was part of my training.

214
00:10:12,572 --> 00:10:13,906
Before you look to your training,

215
00:10:13,931 --> 00:10:15,391
look to your common sense.

216
00:10:18,428 --> 00:10:21,687
The work of Judgment isn't exactly a walk in the park!

217
00:10:23,563 --> 00:10:24,301
Come on.

218
00:10:24,941 --> 00:10:25,674
I'll do better!

219
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:29,485
I promise you I can do this job!

220
00:10:29,599 --> 00:10:30,738
Yes, of course.

221
00:10:31,029 --> 00:10:32,008
Just hang in there.

222
00:11:38,229 --> 00:11:40,142
It's no use. I should quit.

223
00:11:42,477 --> 00:11:43,644
Oh, thank you.

224
00:11:48,649 --> 00:11:51,577
Being out in the field is a lot
different than training, isn't it?

225
00:11:51,745 --> 00:11:53,276
Yeah. Totally.

226
00:11:53,557 --> 00:11:57,765
I guess I never realized how difficult it
could be to give directions and help people.

227
00:11:59,263 --> 00:12:00,954
Yeah. It was hard for me, too.

228
00:12:01,802 --> 00:12:03,088
You know, the maps.

229
00:12:03,386 --> 00:12:06,164
It can be a hassle even when you think you know the place.

230
00:12:13,229 --> 00:12:14,531
Yes. Konori here.

231
00:12:16,761 --> 00:12:17,042
Right.

232
00:12:18,994 --> 00:12:19,648
I hear you.

233
00:12:19,985 --> 00:12:21,846
We'll both keep our eyes open for it, then.

234
00:12:23,194 --> 00:12:25,285
Well, it looks like we've got something to find.

235
00:12:25,512 --> 00:12:26,551
Oh yeah, really?

236
00:12:26,576 --> 00:12:28,218
Yeah. They say it's a bag.

237
00:12:28,284 --> 00:12:28,959
A bag?

238
00:12:29,931 --> 00:12:32,383
In the beginning it was just garbage bins,

239
00:12:32,408 --> 00:12:34,541
but the latest bombs were put into stuffed animals

240
00:12:34,566 --> 00:12:36,806
or other toys to make them less suspicious.

241
00:12:37,161 --> 00:12:40,457
The bag we want, could it be a kid's by any chance?

242
00:12:40,482 --> 00:12:42,457
Well, yeah, but how did you know that?

243
00:12:42,634 --> 00:12:45,009
Apparently it's pink and has some flowers on it.

244
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:46,938
She said she left it on a bench,

245
00:12:46,973 --> 00:12:49,373
and then a dog grabbed it and started running away.

246
00:12:49,398 --> 00:12:50,801
No! Not a dog!

247
00:12:51,009 --> 00:12:53,025
We have to do something now!

248
00:12:53,077 --> 00:12:54,912
Come on. Let's hurry up and go catch it.

249
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:56,150
Well, yeah.

250
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:58,241
It would be a pain if he dropped it somewhere.

251
00:12:58,266 --> 00:12:59,494
You're worried about that?

252
00:12:59,527 --> 00:13:01,903
We would have no way of telling who walked away with it.

253
00:13:01,928 --> 00:13:02,343
So...

254
00:13:02,609 --> 00:13:03,704
It could be anywhere.

255
00:13:03,932 --> 00:13:04,688
Let's go!

256
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,299
We need to find that bag!

257
00:13:06,515 --> 00:13:08,152
Uh... Uh... huh.

258
00:13:08,881 --> 00:13:09,660
Of course.

259
00:13:15,354 --> 00:13:16,357
Hey, sorry.

260
00:13:16,435 --> 00:13:18,364
But I can't really squeeze through there.

261
00:13:18,446 --> 00:13:19,464
Don't worry about it.

262
00:13:19,614 --> 00:13:21,734
I'm almost all the way through. I think.

263
00:13:23,323 --> 00:13:24,740
Are you okay, Misaka?

264
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:25,953
There's a bug.

265
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:27,567
It has lots of legs.

266
00:13:28,082 --> 00:13:29,777
Ah! No! Get away!

267
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:35,627
Come on. Where are you hiding?

268
00:13:38,266 --> 00:13:39,094
What is it?

269
00:13:39,368 --> 00:13:41,344
There's a bug. It has no legs!

270
00:13:41,563 --> 00:13:44,053
Ah! No! Get away!

271
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:47,336
Hm.

272
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:48,963
No, nothing here.

273
00:13:50,043 --> 00:13:51,699
Why do I have to be on the bottom?

274
00:13:51,724 --> 00:13:53,197
And what is she doing?

275
00:13:53,262 --> 00:13:55,365
The bag we're looking for isn't gonna be up there.

276
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:56,414
This is stupid!

277
00:13:57,081 --> 00:13:58,970
A little bit more to the right, please.

278
00:13:59,312 --> 00:14:00,410
Yeah. Sure.

279
00:14:02,485 --> 00:14:03,937
Ah! There's a bug!

280
00:14:03,978 --> 00:14:05,858
Ah! Whoa. Steady, now.

281
00:14:09,331 --> 00:14:11,943
Oh, really? Area D, as well?

282
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,267
Okay, thank you.

283
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:15,613
We appreciate all your help with this matter.

284
00:14:18,443 --> 00:14:20,609
Oh, hey. Is Uiharu here?

285
00:14:20,634 --> 00:14:21,797
Yeah, she's in the back.

286
00:14:24,224 --> 00:14:26,921
Yes. Judgment. Branch 177.

287
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:28,048
There you are!

288
00:14:28,118 --> 00:14:29,207
You gotta listen to this.

289
00:14:29,232 --> 00:14:31,182
I finally found the song I was looking for.

290
00:14:31,207 --> 00:14:31,509
Shh!

291
00:14:32,186 --> 00:14:34,350
She's finally tired enough to sleep.

292
00:14:35,305 --> 00:14:36,964
Aw, she's adorable!

293
00:14:37,031 --> 00:14:38,790
I never knew you had a little girl.

294
00:14:38,815 --> 00:14:40,655
Yeah! No. Wait.

295
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:42,837
So, when will she get flowers?

296
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,544
You know these don't grow out of my head, right?

297
00:14:45,569 --> 00:14:46,425
Oh, I see.

298
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:47,785
And for your information,

299
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:49,468
I don't have any children, either.

300
00:14:49,736 --> 00:14:50,725
But look at her.

301
00:14:50,814 --> 00:14:52,518
Right around the eyes. Do you see?

302
00:14:52,543 --> 00:14:53,656
Not my daughter!

303
00:14:55,538 --> 00:14:56,314
Easy, now.

304
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,187
You'll wake her up if you're not careful.

305
00:14:58,212 --> 00:14:59,776
You're the one being loud, Saten.

306
00:14:59,801 --> 00:15:00,743
Yeah, I'm sorry.

307
00:15:00,993 --> 00:15:02,536
So, who is she?

308
00:15:02,755 --> 00:15:03,964
Did she get lost or something?

309
00:15:03,989 --> 00:15:04,937
It's not that.

310
00:15:05,056 --> 00:15:07,129
We're just trying to help find her bag for her,

311
00:15:07,154 --> 00:15:07,709
that's all.

312
00:15:08,367 --> 00:15:10,924
Apparently it was a birthday present from her parents,

313
00:15:10,957 --> 00:15:12,472
so it's very important.

314
00:15:12,956 --> 00:15:16,089
So we've asked the other branches
to assist us in the search, also.

315
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,565
Until the search is complete,

316
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:19,037
Shirai and I are looking after her.

317
00:15:19,062 --> 00:15:21,830
Wow. All of Judgment looking for a bag?

318
00:15:22,105 --> 00:15:23,356
Why is it such a big deal?

319
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:26,351
Life is much different here.

320
00:15:26,402 --> 00:15:28,754
You're completely separated from your family.

321
00:15:29,533 --> 00:15:32,817
It's something everybody
understands when a child is homesick.

322
00:15:33,298 --> 00:15:37,884
Hm. Judgment handles more than I ever realized before now.

323
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:40,529
There, there.

324
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:45,105
It really matters.

325
00:15:45,672 --> 00:15:47,172
I'm sick of this. Where are you?

326
00:15:53,303 --> 00:15:54,734
Hey! Watch where you're going, punk.

327
00:15:55,076 --> 00:15:57,206
You bump into someone without apologizing?

328
00:15:57,501 --> 00:15:58,858
No. I didn't.

329
00:15:59,071 --> 00:15:59,866
You ran...

330
00:16:00,298 --> 00:16:02,496
Aw, look. The little twerp wants to argue!

331
00:16:05,794 --> 00:16:07,211
Stop it! What are you doing?

332
00:16:08,904 --> 00:16:11,521
It's Judgment. So no big deal, then.

333
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:13,935
What do you mean, "No big deal then"?

334
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,751
You two were just ganging up on that guy.

335
00:16:15,776 --> 00:16:16,742
Shut up already.

336
00:16:17,132 --> 00:16:17,916
What a brat.

337
00:16:20,737 --> 00:16:23,176
No. Patience. Patience.

338
00:16:25,942 --> 00:16:26,825
Are you okay?

339
00:16:28,189 --> 00:16:29,929
It's a little late for that.

340
00:16:34,332 --> 00:16:35,713
That wasn't very polite.

341
00:16:35,738 --> 00:16:36,701
Hey, Misaka.

342
00:16:37,351 --> 00:16:39,005
Well? Did you find it?

343
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,283
Oh! No.

344
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:41,854
Not here either, huh?

345
00:16:42,372 --> 00:16:44,571
Where haven't we looked for it yet? Let's see.

346
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,500
Maybe here.

347
00:16:51,022 --> 00:16:53,384
No. Please don't tell me it's in the park.

348
00:16:53,443 --> 00:16:54,717
There are all these kids here.

349
00:16:54,828 --> 00:16:57,602
True. Children and dogs don't always get along.

350
00:16:57,674 --> 00:17:00,082
Dogs? That's not what I'm talking about!

351
00:17:00,431 --> 00:17:00,962
Really?

352
00:17:01,273 --> 00:17:03,081
Because it's a dog we're looking for.

353
00:17:03,146 --> 00:17:05,021
No, I... I mean, are you sure?

354
00:17:05,046 --> 00:17:06,462
Let's concentrate on the bag.

355
00:17:06,612 --> 00:17:08,304
Why don't you start over there, okay?

356
00:17:08,374 --> 00:17:10,032
Hey! Don't leave me!

357
00:17:10,057 --> 00:17:10,831
Off you go, now.

358
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:13,393
That's not fair.

359
00:17:13,624 --> 00:17:15,972
Hey, lady, are you a Judgment officer?

360
00:17:18,346 --> 00:17:20,282
That's a Tokiwadai uniform!

361
00:17:20,307 --> 00:17:21,853
Are you a princess?

362
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:23,128
Uh, I...

363
00:17:24,162 --> 00:17:26,644
She's wearing shorts underneath her skirt. Look!

364
00:17:26,669 --> 00:17:28,390
Why do you think she's wearing those?

365
00:17:28,515 --> 00:17:29,996
Maybe it's a princess thing.

366
00:17:30,447 --> 00:17:33,413
Hey. Don't you have underwear like normal people?

367
00:17:33,477 --> 00:17:35,115
I'm wearing them underneath the shorts!

368
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:36,630
She's going commando!

369
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:38,446
A commando Judgment officer!

370
00:17:38,471 --> 00:17:40,060
You don't know what you're talking about!

371
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,557
Ooh, look. A dog!

372
00:17:43,725 --> 00:17:44,536
Got you!

373
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:46,797
Konori, quick!

374
00:17:46,821 --> 00:17:47,864
Stop right there!

375
00:17:48,302 --> 00:17:49,597
I can take care of this.

376
00:17:50,681 --> 00:17:53,155
He's fast! I don't have any choice.

377
00:17:56,599 --> 00:17:58,432
Hah... hah! I've got you!

378
00:18:00,681 --> 00:18:01,189
Huh?

379
00:18:02,015 --> 00:18:02,840
Look out!

380
00:18:03,245 --> 00:18:03,650
No!

381
00:18:05,772 --> 00:18:07,511
It's mine now!

382
00:18:08,982 --> 00:18:09,728
Misaka!

383
00:18:13,141 --> 00:18:14,667
Target safely recovered.

384
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:15,476
She's so cool!

385
00:18:15,501 --> 00:18:15,961
She is a princess!

386
00:18:15,985 --> 00:18:16,790
I knew it.

387
00:18:18,056 --> 00:18:20,224
Well done, Misaka. That was something.

388
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:21,284
Whoa!

389
00:18:21,494 --> 00:18:24,124
Uh, don't you think you should handle it more gently?

390
00:18:24,219 --> 00:18:26,293
And shouldn't we be calling in the bomb squad now?

391
00:18:26,318 --> 00:18:26,770
Uh,

392
00:18:27,785 --> 00:18:29,057
what are you talking about?

393
00:18:36,862 --> 00:18:38,726
Here. Try not to lose it again.

394
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:39,698
Yeah!

395
00:18:40,796 --> 00:18:42,050
That was really good work.

396
00:18:43,028 --> 00:18:45,002
I knew Konori would come through!

397
00:18:45,241 --> 00:18:47,148
I'm not the one who found it, actually.

398
00:18:49,433 --> 00:18:50,853
What was Misaka doing here?

399
00:18:51,314 --> 00:18:54,306
I'm sorry. I didn't realize
you were acquainted with Misaka.

400
00:18:54,331 --> 00:18:55,870
Um, acquainted with her?

401
00:18:55,895 --> 00:18:57,478
That's Mikoto Misaka.

402
00:18:57,604 --> 00:18:59,145
You know, from Tokiwadai?

403
00:18:59,349 --> 00:19:01,684
Mikoto. Misaka.

404
00:19:03,325 --> 00:19:04,672
You don't mean the Railgun?

405
00:19:04,751 --> 00:19:06,951
Well, yeah. But what is she doing here?

406
00:19:07,068 --> 00:19:09,762
And, more importantly, what is she doing soaking wet?

407
00:19:10,099 --> 00:19:11,042
Oh, about that.

408
00:19:11,653 --> 00:19:15,272
She actually dove into the fountain
to protect the bag from going in.

409
00:19:15,334 --> 00:19:18,676
Apparently she was convinced that
there was a bomb inside the bag.

410
00:19:18,978 --> 00:19:20,629
Hey, is that my...

411
00:19:20,989 --> 00:19:24,886
Seriously, how does this happen
after all the lectures I've given her?

412
00:19:24,974 --> 00:19:27,977
Hey, now. This is totally something she would do.

413
00:19:33,122 --> 00:19:34,355
K... Kuroko!

414
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,049
I, uh, I can explain.

415
00:19:36,114 --> 00:19:37,799
There's no need to be flustered.

416
00:19:38,538 --> 00:19:40,422
Miss Railgun of Tokiwadai.

417
00:19:41,393 --> 00:19:43,588
Oh. Uh, well...

418
00:19:43,707 --> 00:19:44,582
She knows, then?

419
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:45,940
Okay, that's cool.

420
00:19:46,096 --> 00:19:47,637
Come on. This way.

421
00:19:52,789 --> 00:19:53,841
Pretty lady.

422
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:55,603
Thanks a lot!

423
00:19:56,651 --> 00:19:57,214
Oh.

424
00:19:57,537 --> 00:19:59,551
I mean, really I just...

425
00:20:05,164 --> 00:20:06,439
You're very welcome!

426
00:20:07,937 --> 00:20:09,074
Good job, sweetie.

427
00:20:09,098 --> 00:20:09,840
Mm... hm!

428
00:20:09,865 --> 00:20:11,475
After everything I said, Sissy,

429
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,631
Job well done.

430
00:20:15,576 --> 00:20:17,925
This has been one heck of a day, hasn't it?

431
00:20:18,474 --> 00:20:20,258
You'll get no sympathy from me.

432
00:20:20,284 --> 00:20:22,531
You're the one who decided to play Judgment officer

433
00:20:22,564 --> 00:20:24,141
because you were annoyed with the rules

434
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:25,248
I'd laid out for you.

435
00:20:25,565 --> 00:20:27,861
I hope you learned your lesson this time, at least.

436
00:20:28,015 --> 00:20:29,420
It sure is hard, huh?

437
00:20:29,757 --> 00:20:31,150
Being in Judgment, I mean.

438
00:20:31,659 --> 00:20:32,882
What are you saying?

439
00:20:33,104 --> 00:20:35,063
Maybe I should look at you in a different light.

440
00:20:37,914 --> 00:20:40,844
You don't know how much I have
longed for this day to come.

441
00:20:42,386 --> 00:20:44,275
Please look at me in a different light!

442
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,425
If this one doesn't work,

443
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:47,557
I'm happy to change it for you, Sissy!

444
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,724
Whoa! No! I didn't mean that literally!

445
00:20:50,195 --> 00:20:50,735
Sissy!

446
00:20:51,812 --> 00:20:54,324
Sissy! Just look at me! I'll change the light!

447
00:20:54,349 --> 00:20:56,408
Anything you want! Oh, Sissy!

448
00:21:05,535 --> 00:21:06,730
Keep it down!

449
00:22:41,069 --> 00:22:42,133
We're with Judgment!

450
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:44,521
I need everybody to evacuate the store at once!

451
00:22:44,698 --> 00:22:45,739
Hey, what's going on?

452
00:22:45,764 --> 00:22:47,162
What's happening in my store?

453
00:22:47,438 --> 00:22:49,902
Sir, we have detected accelerated gravitons here.

454
00:22:50,037 --> 00:22:50,720
You what?

455
00:22:50,912 --> 00:22:52,782
I'm sorry, but it's possible there's a bomb

456
00:22:52,807 --> 00:22:54,106
hidden somewhere in this store.

457
00:22:54,215 --> 00:22:55,439
Wha? A bomb?

458
00:22:56,890 --> 00:22:58,224
Damn. Where is it?

459
00:23:00,354 --> 00:23:01,200
Are you okay?

460
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,481
I'm sorry. I fell.

461
00:23:03,767 --> 00:23:04,965
Let's get you out of here.

462
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:05,537
Thank you.

463
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:09,177
No! Not yet!

464
00:23:18,706 --> 00:23:19,593
Are you okay?

465
00:23:20,629 --> 00:23:21,267
Are you hurt?

466
00:23:23,884 --> 00:23:24,773
I'm fine.

467
00:23:25,109 --> 00:23:25,974
He shielded me.

468
00:23:30,762 --> 00:23:33,304
I'm doing it. I'm doing it.

469
00:23:33,554 --> 00:23:36,971
I said I was gonna do it, and I'm doing it now!

470
00:23:37,134 --> 00:23:39,242
Doing what? Who are you?
