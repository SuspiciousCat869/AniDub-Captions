1
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:20,545
It looks like those guys are bothering her.

2
00:00:20,628 --> 00:00:22,961
You think we should call Judgment and get them down here?

3
00:00:25,003 --> 00:00:25,969
Here we go.

4
00:00:26,088 --> 00:00:27,811
Never a dull moment in this place.

5
00:00:28,065 --> 00:00:29,635
Lovely Academy City.

6
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:31,446
Welcome to our amazing city,

7
00:00:31,517 --> 00:00:34,878
a thriving urban area with a
population of twenty-three million.

8
00:00:34,961 --> 00:00:36,678
Eighty percent of which are students.

9
00:00:37,128 --> 00:00:42,195
The city itself is like a giant experiment, standing
at the very forefront of the scientific community.

10
00:00:43,211 --> 00:00:46,003
It's estimated that the technology we use here,

11
00:00:46,086 --> 00:00:50,086
is twenty to thirty years more advanced than
you'll find anywhere else in the world today.

12
00:00:51,378 --> 00:00:52,108
Now, then.

13
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,922
Can you tell me what all the students are here to study?

14
00:00:55,954 --> 00:00:58,211
Esper powers!

15
00:00:58,406 --> 00:01:00,086
I can't wait til I find out my power!

16
00:01:00,111 --> 00:01:02,545
The city has a tip-top public safety system,

17
00:01:02,628 --> 00:01:06,086
so you parents will never have to worry
about your precious children while they're here.

18
00:01:06,238 --> 00:01:07,636
Please rest assured that...

19
00:01:12,961 --> 00:01:13,920
Ow.

20
00:01:14,183 --> 00:01:15,279
What was that?

21
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,045
Did we hit something?

22
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,815
The traffic signals are out.

23
00:01:24,569 --> 00:01:25,180
Damn!

24
00:01:25,569 --> 00:01:26,794
Nothing's going right.

25
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:28,159
Who in the world is that?

26
00:01:28,199 --> 00:01:29,686
Hold it right there, punk!

27
00:01:34,777 --> 00:01:36,237
In the name of Judgment!

28
00:01:36,978 --> 00:01:40,003
I was right. You're the hoodlum
they named in the alert, aren't you?

29
00:01:40,028 --> 00:01:41,887
It looks like today isn't your day.

30
00:01:44,422 --> 00:01:45,041
Damn.

31
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:48,538
This is Kuroko Shirai.

32
00:01:48,563 --> 00:01:50,365
I've just captured one of the criminals.

33
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:53,217
Uiharu, where are the remaining targets to apprehend?

34
00:01:53,598 --> 00:01:55,260
Take a left at the end of the alley,

35
00:01:55,324 --> 00:01:57,451
then another left five meters after that.

36
00:01:57,929 --> 00:01:59,220
Copy that! On it!

37
00:02:01,425 --> 00:02:02,811
Halt, in the name of Judgment!

38
00:02:02,836 --> 00:02:04,753
We've been alerted to your activities.

39
00:02:04,844 --> 00:02:06,614
Come quietly, or I'll be forced to....

40
00:02:10,459 --> 00:02:11,670
What happened here?

41
00:02:17,586 --> 00:02:18,944
Oh. Hey, Kuroko.

42
00:02:20,016 --> 00:02:20,920
Sissy!

43
00:03:54,755 --> 00:03:55,732
Honestly!

44
00:03:56,461 --> 00:03:59,171
How many times do I have to say it before you understand?

45
00:03:59,615 --> 00:04:04,510
Maintaining the public safety of Academy
City is a job for Judgment, not regular citizens.

46
00:04:04,586 --> 00:04:07,045
You can't keep doing that sort of thing on your own.

47
00:04:08,523 --> 00:04:09,843
Are you listening to me?

48
00:04:09,946 --> 00:04:10,962
Well, Sissy?

49
00:04:11,558 --> 00:04:13,734
I can't help it if I get there first, can I?

50
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:16,086
I'm always done by the time you guys even show up.

51
00:04:16,318 --> 00:04:19,342
You can't just beat up another
student without authorization.

52
00:04:19,836 --> 00:04:22,578
The city directors get all twitchy when that happens.

53
00:04:22,753 --> 00:04:25,661
In that case, maybe you guys should
try getting there a little sooner.

54
00:04:26,518 --> 00:04:28,661
Academy City isn't living up to its name.

55
00:04:29,034 --> 00:04:32,852
They've got security posted all over, but
they can't even eliminate petty criminals.

56
00:04:33,181 --> 00:04:36,185
They can claim to be scientifically
advanced all they want, but...

57
00:04:36,971 --> 00:04:37,416
Sissy...

58
00:04:39,339 --> 00:04:40,170
Chaser!

59
00:04:42,326 --> 00:04:45,270
I don't see how those advances really impact our lives.

60
00:04:45,409 --> 00:04:47,162
What am I going to do with you?

61
00:04:47,187 --> 00:04:50,718
How come you still insist on wearing
those dowdy shorts under your skirt?

62
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,718
Why were you even looking?

63
00:04:52,908 --> 00:04:54,845
I wear these because it's easier to...

64
00:05:00,361 --> 00:05:03,420
Trouble detected with vending
machine seven-one-one-six-five.

65
00:05:03,599 --> 00:05:05,285
Destruction of property suspected.

66
00:05:05,436 --> 00:05:07,126
Destruction of property suspected.

67
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:13,129
Now, was that really necessary?

68
00:05:13,295 --> 00:05:14,711
You could've gotten into trouble.

69
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:15,961
Oh, no.

70
00:05:15,986 --> 00:05:16,994
We're going to have to hurry.

71
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,726
Hm? Oh. That's right.

72
00:05:19,798 --> 00:05:21,800
We have our System Scan today, huh?

73
00:05:43,627 --> 00:05:44,795
Those are waves.

74
00:05:46,586 --> 00:05:47,440
A star.

75
00:05:48,029 --> 00:05:48,760
Waves.

76
00:05:49,498 --> 00:05:50,196
Circle.

77
00:05:50,376 --> 00:05:52,031
Next, 38 degrees.

78
00:05:52,096 --> 00:05:52,667
Right.

79
00:05:54,045 --> 00:05:55,836
Off by point two millimeters.

80
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,461
Very good. Next student please.

81
00:06:02,836 --> 00:06:06,050
Recording 78 meters and 23 centimeters.

82
00:06:06,189 --> 00:06:08,843
Distance from target, 54 centimeters.

83
00:06:09,177 --> 00:06:11,275
Overall rating, Level 4.

84
00:06:12,545 --> 00:06:15,003
I'm feeling a little bit off today for some reason.

85
00:06:15,052 --> 00:06:17,900
Maybe my work with Judgment yesterday exhausted my...

86
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:20,920
Making excuses for your poor performance?

87
00:06:21,003 --> 00:06:22,795
Don't you think that's a little pathetic?

88
00:06:22,878 --> 00:06:24,233
Even for you, Shirai.

89
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:25,235
Shut it, Mitsuko Kongo.

90
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,276
At the rate you're going,

91
00:06:26,301 --> 00:06:28,871
it's pretty obvious I'll reach Level 5 before you do.

92
00:06:28,896 --> 00:06:30,057
Won't that be exciting?

93
00:06:30,366 --> 00:06:30,747
Hmph.

94
00:06:31,048 --> 00:06:32,387
I'd greatly appreciate it

95
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:35,128
if you'd avoid comparing your abilities with my powers.

96
00:06:35,153 --> 00:06:38,336
The differences between grasping three-dimensional
space and eleven-dimensional space are simply...

97
00:06:38,363 --> 00:06:39,770
It will be a nice change.

98
00:06:39,795 --> 00:06:44,073
I've always found it annoying to have a first-year
student like you talking down to someone like me.

99
00:06:44,572 --> 00:06:48,003
She never developed the ability to
listen to anybody's voice but her own.

100
00:06:53,266 --> 00:06:55,547
Geez. Was that some kind of explosion?

101
00:06:56,396 --> 00:07:01,270
Since you transferred in this term as a second year, there
are probably some gaps in your knowledge of the school.

102
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:04,737
A certain student is having her
abilities tested at the pool right now.

103
00:07:04,878 --> 00:07:07,120
And she's the real Ace of Tokiwadai.

104
00:07:08,981 --> 00:07:11,352
If they didn't use the water
in the pool to act as a buffer,

105
00:07:11,377 --> 00:07:13,926
they couldn't accurately measure her destructive powers.

106
00:07:15,889 --> 00:07:16,842
What do you think?

107
00:07:16,867 --> 00:07:19,580
Are you ready to face one of those blasts head-on, huh?

108
00:07:23,087 --> 00:07:26,471
Recording initial shot speed at
one-thousand-thirty meters per second.

109
00:07:26,711 --> 00:07:29,092
Rapid-fire ability, eight shots per minute.

110
00:07:30,068 --> 00:07:32,778
Pattern grouping, eighteen point nine millimeters.

111
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:35,155
Overall rating, Level 5.

112
00:07:48,764 --> 00:07:51,449
Huh? You heard it from across the school grounds?

113
00:07:51,474 --> 00:07:52,839
It was incredibly loud.

114
00:07:52,982 --> 00:07:55,189
Girls were nearly jumping out of their skins.

115
00:07:55,286 --> 00:07:56,225
Good grief.

116
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,760
It's so annoying that's the only
way to get an accurate reading.

117
00:07:59,514 --> 00:08:03,192
Sometimes I think an ability like yours
would be a lot more convenient than mine.

118
00:08:03,503 --> 00:08:06,925
Isn't it amazing how the grass is
always greener on the other side?

119
00:08:07,001 --> 00:08:09,269
Yeah, yeah, spout all the platitudes you want to...

120
00:08:09,294 --> 00:08:10,373
Say whatever you want.

121
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:13,122
It doesn't change the fact that you're Tokiwadai's Ace.

122
00:08:13,176 --> 00:08:16,103
You can thrust out your chest
with pride based upon that alone.

123
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:17,595
The Ace, am I?

124
00:08:17,796 --> 00:08:19,883
Although, I may be wrong.

125
00:08:21,295 --> 00:08:25,061
This small chest of yours might be
too modest and bashful to be thrust out.

126
00:08:25,184 --> 00:08:27,828
But, oh! It's this very modesty

127
00:08:27,853 --> 00:08:30,878
that lays at the heart of your
undeniable sensuality, Sissy!

128
00:08:30,961 --> 00:08:34,866
This simple yet elegant temptation is
almost too much for one girl to bear!

129
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,679
My poor heart might break!

130
00:08:38,878 --> 00:08:41,081
There's already something broken in your head.

131
00:08:41,445 --> 00:08:43,638
I was just trying to bond with you, Sissy.

132
00:08:43,743 --> 00:08:44,283
Shut up!

133
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,543
Let's see.

134
00:08:56,584 --> 00:09:01,562
U... i... ha... ru!

135
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:08,128
Oh, I see that you're sporting
the light pink polka-dots today.

136
00:09:10,502 --> 00:09:11,573
I can't believe you!

137
00:09:11,598 --> 00:09:12,891
What do you think you're doing, Saten?

138
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:14,061
Oh, come on, just relax.

139
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:15,211
We're classmates, aren't we?

140
00:09:15,236 --> 00:09:17,270
There's no need to be so bashful about it.

141
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:18,836
Here, let's try again.

142
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:19,971
It'll make you feel better.

143
00:09:24,276 --> 00:09:25,851
You're awful, you know that?

144
00:09:25,954 --> 00:09:26,753
Sorry, sorry.

145
00:09:26,836 --> 00:09:28,061
I got carried away.

146
00:09:28,146 --> 00:09:29,829
Want to see mine to even the score?

147
00:09:29,854 --> 00:09:30,793
No, thank you.

148
00:09:31,128 --> 00:09:33,086
Sometimes I think you're pure evil.

149
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:34,582
Oh, I forgot. How'd it go?

150
00:09:35,622 --> 00:09:36,559
How did what go?

151
00:09:36,711 --> 00:09:38,052
Well, what do you think, silly?

152
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,410
You had your System Scan.

153
00:09:39,435 --> 00:09:39,863
Oh.

154
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:42,493
An absolute disaster.

155
00:09:42,797 --> 00:09:44,420
I'm still ranked a Level 1,

156
00:09:44,594 --> 00:09:47,336
just like I've always been way back to grade school.

157
00:09:47,506 --> 00:09:49,455
You should have heard my homeroom teacher,

158
00:09:49,606 --> 00:09:51,795
"Are those flowers on your head just for show?

159
00:09:51,878 --> 00:09:54,929
Use their blooming power to encourage
your own abilities to blossom!"

160
00:09:56,167 --> 00:09:56,953
Oh, wow.

161
00:09:57,231 --> 00:10:00,211
There's so much in that speech I
could make fun of, it's too easy.

162
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:01,356
But, that aside,

163
00:10:01,779 --> 00:10:03,128
try to keep your chin up, 'kay?

164
00:10:03,515 --> 00:10:08,099
Level 1 is a whole lot better than nothing,
if you ask me. Unlike my pathetic Level Zero.

165
00:10:08,252 --> 00:10:09,920
I am officially incompetent.

166
00:10:13,051 --> 00:10:14,791
Now, now. Don't worry about me.

167
00:10:15,586 --> 00:10:18,032
I make sure to enjoy every day as much as I can.

168
00:10:18,175 --> 00:10:19,817
Long as I do that, it's okay!

169
00:10:20,812 --> 00:10:22,106
That's a good philosophy.

170
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:24,570
Here. Listen to this. It'll cheer you up.

171
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:27,611
It's Hitotsui Hajime!

172
00:10:27,636 --> 00:10:28,419
What's this song?

173
00:10:28,443 --> 00:10:31,155
You wouldn't have heard it. I
downloaded the pre-release early.

174
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:34,039
The album this song is on actually goes on sale today.

175
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:37,233
Do you still buy the CD even after you've downloaded it?

176
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,410
Of course I do.

177
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:42,128
But I still like entering to win
stuff like this limited-release download.

178
00:10:42,393 --> 00:10:44,568
Because that is the mark of a true fan!

179
00:10:45,203 --> 00:10:47,111
Now, come with me so we can buy that CD!

180
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:50,379
I can't go with you. I have a
meeting with Kuroko Shirai today.

181
00:10:50,709 --> 00:10:52,109
That name sounds familiar.

182
00:10:52,177 --> 00:10:54,020
Is she that girl who's in Judgment with you?

183
00:10:54,188 --> 00:10:56,020
My fondest wish is about to come true.

184
00:10:56,099 --> 00:10:58,088
Today I'm going to meet Mikoto Misaka.

185
00:10:58,253 --> 00:11:01,230
She's one of only seven Level-5s in all of Academy City!

186
00:11:01,389 --> 00:11:02,795
The Ace of Tokiwadai!

187
00:11:02,939 --> 00:11:04,145
I think she's amazing!

188
00:11:04,338 --> 00:11:07,046
Really, a Level 5 from Tokiwadai Middle School?

189
00:11:07,114 --> 00:11:11,912
I bet she's just another arrogant jerk who flaunts
her power while looking down her nose at the rest of us.

190
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:12,969
No, she's not!

191
00:11:13,329 --> 00:11:14,955
People like her are all the same.

192
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:17,523
They treat anyone on the lower Levels with contempt.

193
00:11:17,674 --> 00:11:18,860
I think they're disgusting.

194
00:11:19,878 --> 00:11:22,338
And she'll be worse since she's the darling of Tokiwadai.

195
00:11:22,363 --> 00:11:24,395
The darling of Tokiwadai. I love that!

196
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:27,191
I get to meet somebody who's
no simple student, but a darling!

197
00:11:27,326 --> 00:11:28,334
Know what I think?

198
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:32,030
You're so starry-eyed over meeting a
celebrity that it's addled your brains.

199
00:11:32,055 --> 00:11:35,336
I'm excited about meeting her because
I'm sure she's a very nice person.

200
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:38,082
And the anticipation hasn't affected my brain at all!

201
00:11:38,378 --> 00:11:40,494
Hey, I know! Why don't you come along, Saten?

202
00:11:41,238 --> 00:11:42,703
I don't really know about that.

203
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:44,408
Oh, come on. It'll be so much fun!

204
00:11:44,433 --> 00:11:46,503
Yeah, maybe, but I just don't think tha...

205
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:47,545
You don't get a chance like this very often!

206
00:11:47,628 --> 00:11:49,101
Hey, I said I wasn't sure!

207
00:11:49,138 --> 00:11:50,455
Let me think a second.

208
00:11:50,542 --> 00:11:51,709
Uiharu!

209
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,374
One of my fans?

210
00:11:56,667 --> 00:11:58,423
She's a girl I know from Judgment.

211
00:11:58,448 --> 00:12:01,546
She takes care of my backup at the 177th Branch.

212
00:12:01,618 --> 00:12:02,732
She's a big supporter.

213
00:12:02,757 --> 00:12:06,143
She's always asking to meet you,
even if it's only for a few minutes.

214
00:12:08,586 --> 00:12:10,609
Now Sissy, I know that lately your fans

215
00:12:10,634 --> 00:12:12,503
have been becoming more and more annoying

216
00:12:12,528 --> 00:12:14,518
and you have little enough patience for meeting them.

217
00:12:14,925 --> 00:12:19,016
But I think you'll find that Uiharu is
different. She's a reasonable, polite girl.

218
00:12:19,667 --> 00:12:23,278
Besides which, she's one of the few
people I actually consider my friend.

219
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,880
So, really I'm asking you to do it for me.

220
00:12:26,003 --> 00:12:27,628
And since I know how busy you are,

221
00:12:27,653 --> 00:12:30,420
I've taken the liberty of arranging
an orderly schedule for the day.

222
00:12:30,445 --> 00:12:32,278
I'm pretty sure you'll find it to your liking.

223
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:33,658
Hey!

224
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:35,564
Let's see, what have we here?

225
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:38,170
"Date plan with Sissy using Uiharu as a ruse.

226
00:12:38,195 --> 00:12:40,540
Part one, foster friendship at a family restaurant.

227
00:12:40,595 --> 00:12:41,795
Part two, lingerie shopping.

228
00:12:41,878 --> 00:12:43,351
Purchase 'big moment' underwear.

229
00:12:43,376 --> 00:12:45,267
Part three, shopping at a perfume store.

230
00:12:45,292 --> 00:12:46,481
Purchase aphrodisiac.

231
00:12:46,506 --> 00:12:50,351
Ditch Uiharu and go to an upscale
but discreet hotel with Sissy."

232
00:12:50,901 --> 00:12:53,117
In other words, you're just using this reasonable,

233
00:12:53,142 --> 00:12:54,553
polite girl you call your friend

234
00:12:54,578 --> 00:12:56,755
in order to fulfill your own perverted desires.

235
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:57,327
Is that right?

236
00:12:57,711 --> 00:12:58,748
Not really.

237
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:01,663
I thought you were trying to make my life less stressful!

238
00:13:01,688 --> 00:13:03,170
You've got it all wrong, Sissy I swear.

239
00:13:03,195 --> 00:13:04,561
It wasn't like that.

240
00:13:04,602 --> 00:13:07,852
Owowowowowow!

241
00:13:09,309 --> 00:13:10,414
Even so...

242
00:13:10,922 --> 00:13:13,877
You say she's a friend of yours,
Kuroko, so what choice is there?

243
00:13:14,045 --> 00:13:14,991
Oh, my!

244
00:13:15,864 --> 00:13:17,600
Sissy! Sweet Sissy!

245
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:18,252
Kuroko...

246
00:13:18,277 --> 00:13:21,603
At last you reveal how deeply you care about my happiness!

247
00:13:21,628 --> 00:13:22,847
I could die!

248
00:13:22,942 --> 00:13:23,946
I could die right now from hearing that!

249
00:13:23,971 --> 00:13:25,256
Excuse me, miss...

250
00:13:25,281 --> 00:13:26,228
Ah, Sissy, my heart is about
to burst! I can't contain myself!

251
00:13:26,253 --> 00:13:27,686
I'm terribly sorry,

252
00:13:27,711 --> 00:13:30,338
but you're beginning to frighten the other customers.

253
00:13:33,286 --> 00:13:34,961
Now that that's out of the way,

254
00:13:35,045 --> 00:13:36,916
it's time to get to the introductions.

255
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:39,403
This is Kazari Uiharu from Judgment.

256
00:13:39,428 --> 00:13:41,628
She's a first-year at Sakugawa Middle School.

257
00:13:41,809 --> 00:13:43,061
Oh! Pleased to meet you!

258
00:13:43,376 --> 00:13:45,170
I mean, it's really an honor.

259
00:13:45,297 --> 00:13:46,434
And this is?

260
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:50,228
Hi there. My name's Ruiko Saten, a classmate of Uiharu's.

261
00:13:50,253 --> 00:13:53,179
She decided to drag me along with her, so here I am.

262
00:13:53,338 --> 00:13:55,911
And by the way my power rating is Level Zero.

263
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,531
So there!

264
00:13:57,182 --> 00:13:58,462
Saten, why would you say that?

265
00:13:58,487 --> 00:13:59,701
Well, hello, Uiharu.

266
00:13:59,726 --> 00:14:00,392
Saten.

267
00:14:01,641 --> 00:14:03,378
I'm another friend of Kuroko's.

268
00:14:03,564 --> 00:14:04,230
Misaka.

269
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:07,185
Oh, it's a pleasure to meet you.

270
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:08,879
Yes, yes, such a pleasure.

271
00:14:09,253 --> 00:14:12,049
Okay, the introductions have
been completed without incident.

272
00:14:12,336 --> 00:14:14,043
The timetable has been thrown off somewhat,

273
00:14:14,068 --> 00:14:15,416
but I've made this schedule for today

274
00:14:15,441 --> 00:14:16,825
that I think should work for every...

275
00:14:17,848 --> 00:14:18,404
Okay.

276
00:14:19,376 --> 00:14:22,395
Well, standing around here isn't very much fun, is it?

277
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:23,656
I have an idea.

278
00:14:23,918 --> 00:14:25,143
Let's go to the arcade.

279
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:27,254
Go to the arcade?

280
00:14:27,711 --> 00:14:28,581
What do you think?

281
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:30,187
Come on, Kuroko.

282
00:14:30,251 --> 00:14:30,806
Let's go.

283
00:14:36,185 --> 00:14:37,990
I think it's beneath you, Sissy.

284
00:14:38,295 --> 00:14:41,503
I guess playing games in the arcade
and browsing magazines is fun enough,

285
00:14:41,528 --> 00:14:43,731
but shouldn't you have some more dignified hobbies?

286
00:14:43,756 --> 00:14:46,560
You could try arranging flowers,
maybe, or playing the harp.

287
00:14:46,795 --> 00:14:49,427
Please. Why should I waste my
time stuffing flowers in a vase

288
00:14:49,452 --> 00:14:51,486
or learning an instrument no one knows how to play?

289
00:14:51,511 --> 00:14:52,938
Please, take one. Have a good afternoon!

290
00:14:52,963 --> 00:14:53,926
You know something.

291
00:14:54,162 --> 00:14:56,385
She doesn't act like some arrogant celebrity.

292
00:14:56,652 --> 00:14:59,318
Yeah and she doesn't look down
her nose at us at all, either.

293
00:14:59,749 --> 00:15:00,686
What's on the flyer?

294
00:15:00,748 --> 00:15:02,770
It looks like there's a new crepe stand opening,

295
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:06,287
and the first one hundred customers
get a Gekota figurine as a free gift.

296
00:15:07,586 --> 00:15:09,461
Now that's one cheesy looking character.

297
00:15:09,545 --> 00:15:11,817
I mean, who would go for something like that these days?

298
00:15:12,477 --> 00:15:13,310
Oh, sorry.

299
00:15:14,154 --> 00:15:15,378
Is there something wrong?

300
00:15:15,574 --> 00:15:17,628
What's the hold up, Sissy? Something the matter?

301
00:15:18,037 --> 00:15:19,047
Oh, I see.

302
00:15:19,072 --> 00:15:21,392
You're interested in the new crepe stand, aren't you?

303
00:15:21,703 --> 00:15:22,878
Or something else?

304
00:15:22,961 --> 00:15:25,427
Is it the free giveaway they're
offering that caught your eye?

305
00:15:25,836 --> 00:15:28,253
No! I don't know what you're talking about.

306
00:15:28,613 --> 00:15:30,607
Why would I care about this Gekota guy?

307
00:15:30,632 --> 00:15:35,753
I mean, he's just a frog, a stupid amphibian. What kind
of girl would be interested in some dumb thing like that?

308
00:15:48,134 --> 00:15:49,229
Wow.

309
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:51,240
There are so many people.

310
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,704
What's with all the kids running around?

311
00:15:54,561 --> 00:15:57,045
Remember our break will only be one hour long.

312
00:15:57,128 --> 00:15:58,253
Everybody please stay close.

313
00:15:58,336 --> 00:15:59,708
You don't want to miss the bus.

314
00:15:59,733 --> 00:16:00,811
It's some kind of tour.

315
00:16:00,836 --> 00:16:02,201
We must have bad timing.

316
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,961
I'll go see if I can find a free bench to save for us.

317
00:16:05,045 --> 00:16:07,086
Oh, then, why don't I go with you?

318
00:16:07,238 --> 00:16:08,969
Saten, we're finding a place to sit.

319
00:16:08,994 --> 00:16:10,270
Will you get something for us?

320
00:16:10,295 --> 00:16:12,099
Don't worry, we'll pay you back for it later.

321
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:12,988
Huh? Wait...

322
00:16:15,413 --> 00:16:16,492
Huh? What's wrong?

323
00:16:16,857 --> 00:16:17,524
Nothing.

324
00:16:18,393 --> 00:16:20,965
Would you like to switch places with me?

325
00:16:21,607 --> 00:16:23,482
No, it doesn't matter to me who goes first.

326
00:16:23,507 --> 00:16:25,295
We're just here for crepes, so
as long as I get one, I'm fine.

327
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,122
All right! I got a Gekota!

328
00:16:27,177 --> 00:16:28,008
So did I!

329
00:16:28,032 --> 00:16:29,030
So did I!

330
00:16:29,872 --> 00:16:30,970
Thank you for waiting.

331
00:16:31,327 --> 00:16:32,589
Here's your free gift.

332
00:16:33,004 --> 00:16:34,844
You're lucky. It's the last one we have.

333
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:35,711
Great, thank you.

334
00:16:35,736 --> 00:16:37,665
Oh, hold on. The last, you said?

335
00:16:40,819 --> 00:16:42,234
Um, Misaka...

336
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,491
It's all yours if you'd like it.

337
00:16:47,374 --> 00:16:49,208
Are you sure? You really mean it?

338
00:16:49,233 --> 00:16:50,533
Yeah, no problem.

339
00:16:50,558 --> 00:16:51,823
Thank you so much!

340
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:54,003
Y... you're welcome.

341
00:16:59,923 --> 00:17:01,769
Come on, Sissy, just try one bite.

342
00:17:01,794 --> 00:17:02,751
You know you want to!

343
00:17:02,775 --> 00:17:04,040
I said I don't want any!

344
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:06,398
Who chooses anchovies as a topping, anyway?

345
00:17:06,461 --> 00:17:07,461
Open wide and say, "Aaahhhh."

346
00:17:07,486 --> 00:17:08,665
No, just leave me alone already!

347
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:09,770
She's nice, isn't she?

348
00:17:10,569 --> 00:17:11,821
Misaka, I mean.

349
00:17:11,927 --> 00:17:14,856
Not at all what you'd expect for somebody so well known.

350
00:17:14,881 --> 00:17:16,188
She's not stuck up at all.

351
00:17:16,213 --> 00:17:17,867
Just approachable and friendly.

352
00:17:20,447 --> 00:17:21,697
You sure about that?

353
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:26,583
Here.

354
00:17:27,377 --> 00:17:27,979
Uh, what?

355
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,311
Would you like to taste it?

356
00:17:29,336 --> 00:17:31,451
Go on try some as a thank you for before.

357
00:17:32,239 --> 00:17:33,670
Absolutely not!

358
00:17:33,797 --> 00:17:35,028
I won't stand for this, Sissy!

359
00:17:35,053 --> 00:17:36,843
I'm right here, yet you offer somebody else

360
00:17:36,868 --> 00:17:37,844
what is rightfully mine?

361
00:17:37,869 --> 00:17:39,835
I'm not sure I can keep up with your friends.

362
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:40,958
They're so energetic.

363
00:17:42,762 --> 00:17:43,047
Huh?

364
00:17:43,809 --> 00:17:44,786
It's nothing.

365
00:17:45,027 --> 00:17:47,170
I was just noticing that bank over there.

366
00:17:47,471 --> 00:17:50,295
Why would the security shutters
be down in the middle of the day?

367
00:17:58,716 --> 00:17:59,573
What was that crash?

368
00:17:59,598 --> 00:18:03,920
Uiharu, I want you to contact Antiskill and
request some officers to our location right away.

369
00:18:04,207 --> 00:18:04,769
Yeah, I'm on it!

370
00:18:04,794 --> 00:18:05,817
Wait up, Kuroko!

371
00:18:05,842 --> 00:18:06,478
No you don't.

372
00:18:06,503 --> 00:18:07,758
Stay right where you are.

373
00:18:07,972 --> 00:18:12,305
Like I've told you a million times, public
safety is the concern of those of us in Judgment.

374
00:18:12,545 --> 00:18:15,170
Please do me a favor and just behave yourself this time.

375
00:18:15,407 --> 00:18:16,395
Yes, that's correct.

376
00:18:16,544 --> 00:18:20,520
There's a bank robbery in progress across
from the public square on the edge of District 7.

377
00:18:20,673 --> 00:18:21,963
Requesting Antiskill.

378
00:18:24,106 --> 00:18:25,344
Come on, you idiots.

379
00:18:26,036 --> 00:18:27,090
We've gotta move it, or...

380
00:18:27,114 --> 00:18:27,974
Stop right there!

381
00:18:29,461 --> 00:18:30,978
I am a Judgment officer,

382
00:18:31,058 --> 00:18:34,688
and I am placing you under arrest for
destruction of property and bank robbery.

383
00:18:42,545 --> 00:18:44,145
Who does this kid think she is?

384
00:18:44,387 --> 00:18:46,573
Judgment must be short-staffed.

385
00:18:47,862 --> 00:18:49,086
Hey, little lady.

386
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:52,604
You should find somewhere else to
play, or you could end up getting hurt.

387
00:18:53,545 --> 00:18:56,180
Is that the most intimidating line you can come up with?

388
00:18:59,477 --> 00:19:01,494
You're not much of a professional, are you?

389
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:02,066
Wha-?

390
00:19:02,091 --> 00:19:03,061
Damn brat!

391
00:19:03,234 --> 00:19:04,314
She's amazing!

392
00:19:04,339 --> 00:19:05,628
That's Kuroko for you.

393
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:06,849
Please, stay here.

394
00:19:06,874 --> 00:19:08,645
It's not safe to leave the square right now.

395
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:09,118
Let go!

396
00:19:09,142 --> 00:19:09,971
What's wrong here?

397
00:19:10,677 --> 00:19:11,408
Misaka!

398
00:19:11,433 --> 00:19:13,594
We're missing one of the boys who was on the tour!

399
00:19:14,793 --> 00:19:17,846
He said he left something on the
bus, and then he went to look for it.

400
00:19:18,295 --> 00:19:20,371
All right. Uiharu and I will see what we can...

401
00:19:20,396 --> 00:19:21,461
I want to help, too!

402
00:19:24,265 --> 00:19:25,128
All right, then.

403
00:19:25,153 --> 00:19:26,606
Let's split up and look for him.

404
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:32,420
It's too late to back down, now, girlie.

405
00:19:32,602 --> 00:19:34,166
A pyrokineticist?

406
00:19:34,499 --> 00:19:35,142
All right.

407
00:19:37,282 --> 00:19:38,459
Hey, watch it!

408
00:19:40,494 --> 00:19:41,232
Run away?

409
00:19:42,128 --> 00:19:42,895
She's gone!

410
00:19:42,919 --> 00:19:43,920
Who says I'm running?

411
00:19:55,684 --> 00:19:57,405
What? She's a teleporter?

412
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:59,336
You should probably stop resisting me.

413
00:19:59,535 --> 00:20:01,162
Or I'll take drastic measures.

414
00:20:01,187 --> 00:20:04,134
Like teleporting this directly
into your body, for example.

415
00:20:06,328 --> 00:20:07,128
Find anything?

416
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:08,323
No, nothing!

417
00:20:08,895 --> 00:20:11,170
Where in the world has that kid disappeared to?

418
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:13,710
What do we have here?

419
00:20:14,948 --> 00:20:16,443
Perfect! You're coming with me.

420
00:20:16,578 --> 00:20:18,003
What are you doing, mister?

421
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:18,916
Who are you?

422
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,089
Never mind, just move it.

423
00:20:20,114 --> 00:20:20,836
Hurry up!

424
00:20:21,034 --> 00:20:22,304
I have to stop him.

425
00:20:24,537 --> 00:20:26,492
Maybe we should have another look around the square.

426
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:27,878
Hey! What do you want?

427
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:28,922
Go away!

428
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:30,670
Let go!

429
00:20:30,695 --> 00:20:31,402
Damn it!

430
00:20:36,107 --> 00:20:37,295
He hurt Saten!

431
00:20:37,448 --> 00:20:38,170
Kuroko!

432
00:20:42,057 --> 00:20:44,597
From here on out, this fight is a personal one for me.

433
00:20:44,974 --> 00:20:47,811
I hate to do this, but it's too late.

434
00:20:47,982 --> 00:20:49,771
I'm going to have to get involved now.

435
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:52,773
Crap, I just remembered.

436
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:54,708
They say there's this scary girl in Judgment.

437
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:58,613
She's a teleporter who will beat you up inside
and out until you wish that you'd never been born.

438
00:20:58,638 --> 00:21:00,295
I don't know what you're talking about.

439
00:21:00,545 --> 00:21:01,077
Damn her!

440
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,350
I'm not gonna turn tail and run.

441
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:06,528
What's even worse,

442
00:21:06,553 --> 00:21:11,082
apparently this teleporter has given herself,
heart and soul, to a powerful electromaster.

443
00:21:13,415 --> 00:21:14,203
Go ahead.

444
00:21:14,228 --> 00:21:15,982
I'm happy to take you out, too.

445
00:21:16,768 --> 00:21:17,688
That's right.

446
00:21:17,897 --> 00:21:22,290
That girl over there is one of the most powerful
of the twenty-three million people in the city.

447
00:21:23,336 --> 00:21:25,858
Out of the seven Level-5s, she's ranked third.

448
00:21:38,586 --> 00:21:39,492
Railgun.

449
00:21:39,711 --> 00:21:41,094
Mikoto Misaka.

450
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:42,389
My Sissy.

451
00:21:42,891 --> 00:21:45,228
The pride and joy of Tokiwadai Middle School.

452
00:21:45,253 --> 00:21:48,045
The ultimate, unstoppable shock princess!

453
00:22:01,806 --> 00:22:02,745
Wow.

454
00:22:02,928 --> 00:22:04,086
That was incredible.

455
00:22:13,378 --> 00:22:15,902
There were zero injuries among the general population.

456
00:22:16,441 --> 00:22:19,190
Please, keep walking forward in an orderly fashion.

457
00:22:21,295 --> 00:22:24,046
Your pyrotechnic abilities weren't all that bad, you know.

458
00:22:25,067 --> 00:22:28,025
Unless I miss my guess, you'd be right around a Level 3.

459
00:22:28,289 --> 00:22:32,089
You probably got caught up in the excitement
of your powers and went down the wrong path.

460
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:36,020
Take a good look at yourself and
the consequences of your actions,

461
00:22:36,045 --> 00:22:37,981
and maybe you can make a fresh start.

462
00:22:41,878 --> 00:22:42,788
You were great!

463
00:22:42,963 --> 00:22:44,129
Thank you so much!

464
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,770
No, really. It's nothing.

465
00:22:46,795 --> 00:22:48,753
I don't how I can ever repay you.

466
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,211
Thank the nice lady.

467
00:22:50,543 --> 00:22:52,464
Thank you for helping me, nice lady!

468
00:23:04,338 --> 00:23:06,811
You handled that situation pretty well, Saten.

469
00:23:07,481 --> 00:23:08,001
Really?

470
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:08,645
Yeah.

471
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:10,556
I think it was downright heroic of you.

472
00:23:14,562 --> 00:23:15,702
You, too, Misaka.

473
00:23:15,726 --> 00:23:17,764
There you are, Sissyyyyyyy!

474
00:23:17,899 --> 00:23:19,423
Kuroko, let go of me!

475
00:23:19,448 --> 00:23:20,295
You're making a scene!

476
00:23:20,504 --> 00:23:22,498
Look at your face! Are you hurt badly?

477
00:23:22,523 --> 00:23:24,013
Oh, no. I'm okay, really.

478
00:23:24,038 --> 00:23:25,395
It looks bad. Are you sure?

479
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:26,835
Misaka's so brave.

480
00:23:27,929 --> 00:23:29,488
She was the real hero today.

481
00:23:29,513 --> 00:23:30,878
That's it. I've had enough!

482
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,558
My idol Misaka was great today.

483
00:25:03,583 --> 00:25:04,436
She sure was.

484
00:25:04,488 --> 00:25:05,503
Saten, stop it.

485
00:25:05,528 --> 00:25:07,243
What are you pouring water on my head for?

486
