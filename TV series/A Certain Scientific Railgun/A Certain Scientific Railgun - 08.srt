1
00:00:03,007 --> 00:00:05,055
From what we've learned today, it should be apparent

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:09,430
that this aspect of Academy City's
ability-developing curriculum is the most important.

3
00:00:09,732 --> 00:00:10,819
Personal Reality.

4
00:00:11,232 --> 00:00:12,425
To put it another way,

5
00:00:12,561 --> 00:00:15,272
it is the acquiring of a reality unto oneself.

6
00:00:15,539 --> 00:00:18,302
This is the basis for the development of Esper powers.

7
00:00:19,243 --> 00:00:23,573
Once you understand Personal Reality, you
must begin to explore quantum theory as well.

8
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:28,858
This concept is based on the uncertainty principle
postulated by the German physicist Heisenberg.

9
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:33,617
Now, Personal Reality and quantum theory are
connected because they have something in common.

10
00:00:33,935 --> 00:00:35,859
Both concepts are rooted in probability.

11
00:00:37,416 --> 00:00:39,489
For example, let's look at Schrodinger's cat.

12
00:00:40,315 --> 00:00:41,601
Huh? A cold?

13
00:00:41,771 --> 00:00:45,688
Yeah. I only have a slight
fever, but it won't seem to budge.

14
00:00:45,894 --> 00:00:46,568
Okay.

15
00:00:47,274 --> 00:00:49,190
Try to get some rest and feel better.

16
00:00:51,797 --> 00:00:52,352
Saten!

17
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,379
Ruiko Saten!

18
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:56,109
Uh, yes?

19
00:00:56,524 --> 00:00:58,614
You look like you already know the material.

20
00:00:59,091 --> 00:01:01,529
Maybe you'd like to explain that last point to the class.

21
00:01:01,554 --> 00:01:02,521
Oh, sure!

22
00:01:03,571 --> 00:01:04,508
Let's see.

23
00:01:04,985 --> 00:01:05,762
One sec.

24
00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:08,331
Never mind.

25
00:01:08,664 --> 00:01:11,681
I suggest you study up on Personal Reality for next time.

26
00:01:12,995 --> 00:01:14,178
That's all for today.

27
00:01:19,373 --> 00:01:22,136
Who cares about theories and thought experiments?

28
00:01:24,913 --> 00:01:27,286
I wish they'd teach us how to level up faster.

29
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:28,805
That would be useful.

30
00:03:01,549 --> 00:03:03,466
It's really hot out today, isn't it?

31
00:03:07,608 --> 00:03:09,716
What's with the face? You look super grouchy.

32
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:14,399
I can't believe that Hatsuya Kaitabi was a
Level 2. It just doesn't make any sense to me.

33
00:03:15,065 --> 00:03:15,831
Kaitabi?

34
00:03:16,399 --> 00:03:17,236
Oh.

35
00:03:17,442 --> 00:03:19,627
The guy behind the graviton attacks.

36
00:03:20,595 --> 00:03:22,785
But, all of the destruction,

37
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:25,540
he would have to be at least a Level 4 to cause that.

38
00:03:25,565 --> 00:03:28,014
Right. And that can only mean one thing.

39
00:03:29,015 --> 00:03:30,265
Well, it has to mean...

40
00:03:33,806 --> 00:03:35,857
I have no idea. What does it mean?

41
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:36,841
Hey, don't look at me.

42
00:03:36,873 --> 00:03:38,459
That's kinda what I was asking you.

43
00:03:40,032 --> 00:03:41,961
You're stressing. Let's take a break.

44
00:03:42,031 --> 00:03:43,323
It might help you to cool off.

45
00:03:47,626 --> 00:03:48,345
What do you want?

46
00:03:48,409 --> 00:03:50,249
Just whatever you're having, Sissy.

47
00:03:51,506 --> 00:03:53,366
You know what I've always found strange?

48
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:56,950
How whenever you hear a wind chime,
it makes you feel a little bit cooler.

49
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:59,825
Yeah. It does that because of synesthesia.

50
00:04:00,743 --> 00:04:01,947
What's synesthesia?

51
00:04:01,972 --> 00:04:02,986
Thank you for waiting.

52
00:04:03,846 --> 00:04:05,441
Here you go. Two strawberries.

53
00:04:06,347 --> 00:04:09,744
It's the reception of multiple
sensations from a single stimulus.

54
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:11,556
And we're paying separately, by the way.

55
00:04:13,857 --> 00:04:15,290
You were the one who suggested it.

56
00:04:15,315 --> 00:04:16,615
I thought it was your treat.

57
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,814
Huh? What's that?

58
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,097
Oh, nothing at all.

59
00:04:20,661 --> 00:04:24,394
So, anyway, seeing reddish
colors makes you feel warmer, right?

60
00:04:24,614 --> 00:04:27,823
And in the same way, seeing
bluish tones makes you feel cooler.

61
00:04:27,994 --> 00:04:30,487
Reds are warm colors, whereas blues are cool colors.

62
00:04:30,598 --> 00:04:33,346
Right. And this shaved ice is strawberry-red.

63
00:04:33,557 --> 00:04:34,267
I get it.

64
00:04:34,651 --> 00:04:38,343
The fact that it's such a bright red
intensifies the fruitiness of the sensation.

65
00:04:40,943 --> 00:04:42,164
Did your brain freeze?

66
00:04:42,189 --> 00:04:42,902
Aw.

67
00:04:45,749 --> 00:04:47,885
Misaka Shirai! Hey you guys!

68
00:04:49,035 --> 00:04:49,888
Hey, Saten.

69
00:04:50,417 --> 00:04:52,182
Those ices look delicious.

70
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:57,649
Yeah, we feel your pain.

71
00:04:57,674 --> 00:04:59,332
That happened to both of us a second ago.

72
00:04:59,357 --> 00:05:01,869
You know what's going to happen,
but you can't stop eating it.

73
00:05:02,059 --> 00:05:04,156
Ooh. Did you guys get strawberry?

74
00:05:04,315 --> 00:05:05,116
Mm... hmm.

75
00:05:05,274 --> 00:05:06,589
Here, would you like to taste?

76
00:05:06,617 --> 00:05:08,124
Aw, that's so nice of you.

77
00:05:08,306 --> 00:05:09,306
Don't mind if I do!

78
00:05:10,886 --> 00:05:12,521
Mmm, yummy!

79
00:05:12,931 --> 00:05:14,940
Let me give you a bite of lemon in return.

80
00:05:15,024 --> 00:05:16,002
Cool, thank you.

81
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:21,937
What? What do you think you're doing?

82
00:05:22,454 --> 00:05:24,806
Uh, tasting each other's flavors.

83
00:05:24,831 --> 00:05:26,665
You're tasting her flavor.

84
00:05:26,767 --> 00:05:27,529
Tasting.

85
00:05:28,013 --> 00:05:28,559
Flavor.

86
00:05:29,524 --> 00:05:30,686
I could have done that!

87
00:05:30,903 --> 00:05:32,837
Kuroko, you're a complete idiot!

88
00:05:33,152 --> 00:05:34,094
Oh, okay.

89
00:05:34,245 --> 00:05:35,435
Then why don't you kiss my...

90
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,708
I mean taste my flavor, too?

91
00:05:37,733 --> 00:05:40,076
What would be the point? You got the same flavor I did.

92
00:05:42,149 --> 00:05:43,789
Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

93
00:05:43,982 --> 00:05:45,471
I am such a moron!

94
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:51,027
Hey, I just realized Uiharu isn't with you today.

95
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:54,466
She stayed home from school
because, apparently, she's got a cold.

96
00:05:54,558 --> 00:05:57,218
I was just on my way to drop off some medicine for her.

97
00:05:57,359 --> 00:05:58,429
Is it really bad?

98
00:05:58,544 --> 00:06:00,869
No. She doesn't think it's anything serious,

99
00:06:01,116 --> 00:06:03,139
but I know how annoying colds can be.

100
00:06:04,379 --> 00:06:06,716
You know, you guys could come along, too.

101
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:09,479
Here we are!

102
00:06:09,622 --> 00:06:11,193
We all wanted to check up on you.

103
00:06:11,374 --> 00:06:13,043
Hope it isn't a bad time.

104
00:06:13,511 --> 00:06:15,578
Thanks guys. That's sweet.

105
00:06:15,646 --> 00:06:16,574
Don't worry about it.

106
00:06:17,084 --> 00:06:17,981
Now, hold still.

107
00:06:21,024 --> 00:06:22,716
It says 37 point three.

108
00:06:23,103 --> 00:06:26,314
Well, that's slightly high, so
you should probably stay in bed.

109
00:06:26,789 --> 00:06:28,898
And be sure to cover up so you don't catch a chill.

110
00:06:29,214 --> 00:06:31,652
You know, Saten, it might help prevent a chill

111
00:06:31,687 --> 00:06:33,981
if you'd stop flipping my skirt up all the time.

112
00:06:34,006 --> 00:06:35,528
Don't give them the wrong idea!

113
00:06:35,553 --> 00:06:36,969
As Uiharu's best friend,

114
00:06:36,994 --> 00:06:39,457
I just want to make sure she's wearing panties every day

115
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:41,225
like she's supposed to. It's my duty.

116
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,167
Of course I wear panties! Every day!

117
00:06:43,192 --> 00:06:44,918
Yes, of course. We know you do.

118
00:06:45,142 --> 00:06:47,251
Now lie down before you get any worse.

119
00:06:48,433 --> 00:06:50,473
I'll go fix up a cool towel for you.

120
00:06:54,102 --> 00:06:56,233
Oh, I wanted to ask you, Shirai,

121
00:06:56,601 --> 00:06:59,755
have there been any developments
in the graviton attacker case?

122
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,064
There is one thing, I guess.

123
00:07:02,315 --> 00:07:04,223
It isn't really much help, though.

124
00:07:04,898 --> 00:07:08,822
We know that the person who's responsible
for the attacks has a Level 2 ranking.

125
00:07:08,884 --> 00:07:11,509
But what he did was unmistakably Level 4 stuff.

126
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:16,830
So the only development so far is the discovery
that there's even more we don't understand about it?

127
00:07:17,274 --> 00:07:19,292
Yeah, that's pretty much it.

128
00:07:19,834 --> 00:07:24,340
Now that I think about it, didn't you mention
something before about a machine called the Level Upper?

129
00:07:24,982 --> 00:07:25,399
Huh?

130
00:07:26,396 --> 00:07:28,402
It raises a person's ability level?

131
00:07:29,008 --> 00:07:31,214
Yeah, but like I said, it's just a rumor

132
00:07:31,389 --> 00:07:33,706
all totally unsubstantiated.

133
00:07:34,048 --> 00:07:35,737
So there's no proof it exists?

134
00:07:35,762 --> 00:07:36,532
None at all.

135
00:07:36,619 --> 00:07:38,577
The stories about it are all mixed up.

136
00:07:38,748 --> 00:07:41,198
It's nothing more than an urban legend, really.

137
00:07:41,801 --> 00:07:42,576
Oh, well.

138
00:07:43,024 --> 00:07:45,912
I suppose there's no way it
could be that convenient, is there?

139
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:51,870
The truth is, this isn't the first time a person's Level

140
00:07:51,895 --> 00:07:54,855
as shown in the databank doesn't
match what they've actually done.

141
00:07:55,526 --> 00:07:57,931
We've seen situations like this more than once.

142
00:07:57,956 --> 00:07:58,361
Uhh?

143
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:01,042
That girl with the funny eyebrows and the stun gun

144
00:08:01,122 --> 00:08:03,510
and the bank robber who was a pyrokineticist.

145
00:08:03,658 --> 00:08:07,318
I use those as examples because they're
ones you already know about, Sissy.

146
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:12,247
But Judgment has recorded even more instances
of an Esper's ability not matching their attack.

147
00:08:12,949 --> 00:08:14,088
Are you saying?

148
00:08:14,146 --> 00:08:16,804
There really is such a thing as a Level Upper somewhere?

149
00:08:16,883 --> 00:08:19,024
Is there anything else you can tell us about it?

150
00:08:19,049 --> 00:08:20,854
Huh? Let me see.

151
00:08:21,122 --> 00:08:23,372
There is something, but it could be another rumor.

152
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:26,065
I heard somewhere about people who use the Level Upper

153
00:08:26,098 --> 00:08:28,346
posting to some kind of message board on the net.

154
00:08:28,371 --> 00:08:30,288
Do you know which message board it is?

155
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:32,420
Um, let me think.

156
00:08:32,815 --> 00:08:34,163
I don't know. Let's see.

157
00:08:34,188 --> 00:08:35,238
Take a look, Saten.

158
00:08:36,328 --> 00:08:37,287
Could it be this one?

159
00:08:37,355 --> 00:08:38,480
Ah, there it is!

160
00:08:38,523 --> 00:08:40,302
Nicely done, Uiharu!

161
00:08:40,749 --> 00:08:44,015
Now if we can only determine their
identities and where they hang out.

162
00:08:44,185 --> 00:08:47,530
I can't speak to their identities,
but as for their hangouts, look.

163
00:08:47,681 --> 00:08:50,645
They seem to get together at
this restaurant pretty frequently.

164
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:53,457
Thanks a lot, Uiharu.

165
00:08:53,482 --> 00:08:54,735
I'm gonna look into it.

166
00:08:54,789 --> 00:08:56,441
Oh, and get well soon!

167
00:08:57,797 --> 00:08:58,860
Get back here!

168
00:08:59,081 --> 00:09:01,051
This is a job for me! Not you!

169
00:09:01,735 --> 00:09:04,235
Sissy! Listen to me when I'm talking to you!

170
00:09:04,565 --> 00:09:05,013
Sissy!

171
00:09:05,599 --> 00:09:07,442
Do you think they're gonna be okay?

172
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:10,030
With those two, we don't have anything to worry about.

173
00:09:10,231 --> 00:09:13,398
I mean, Kuroko's a Level 4, and Misaka is a Level 5.

174
00:09:13,552 --> 00:09:14,935
What could they need us for, right?

175
00:09:16,753 --> 00:09:17,855
Yeah, I guess so.

176
00:09:18,214 --> 00:09:19,414
Say, Uiharu,

177
00:09:19,983 --> 00:09:22,060
what if we could get a hold of the Level Upper?

178
00:09:22,924 --> 00:09:26,034
Do you think we could really use
it to increase our ability levels?

179
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:27,328
Who knows?

180
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:30,383
But in any case, cheating is wrong.

181
00:09:30,466 --> 00:09:31,415
Yeah, I know.

182
00:09:31,575 --> 00:09:32,732
Just hypothetically.

183
00:09:32,924 --> 00:09:34,748
I would never actually do it, of course.

184
00:09:34,982 --> 00:09:36,473
Hey! I've got an idea!

185
00:09:37,596 --> 00:09:41,104
The teacher called on me at school
today, and I had no clue how to answer.

186
00:09:41,311 --> 00:09:42,845
Think you could explain this to me?

187
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:45,632
I'm sick and you're asking me
to help you do your schoolwork?

188
00:09:45,672 --> 00:09:46,625
I bet you're hungry.

189
00:09:46,674 --> 00:09:48,189
I could make something for you.

190
00:09:48,214 --> 00:09:50,911
And now you're trying to bribe
me with the promise of food?

191
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:53,062
All right, then. Fine.

192
00:09:53,162 --> 00:09:54,187
I won't ask again.

193
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,004
Well, I guess I could eat.

194
00:10:01,383 --> 00:10:02,184
So, anyway.

195
00:10:02,209 --> 00:10:04,898
He told me to study up on Personal Reality,

196
00:10:04,923 --> 00:10:06,927
but I just don't get the concept, you know?

197
00:10:07,358 --> 00:10:09,834
Yeah, it's complicated.

198
00:10:10,183 --> 00:10:12,382
I feel like I've heard something about it before, though.

199
00:10:13,102 --> 00:10:15,207
You have to create a reality unto yourself.

200
00:10:15,332 --> 00:10:17,213
A reality unto oneself?

201
00:10:17,642 --> 00:10:18,991
A reality unto you.

202
00:10:19,095 --> 00:10:20,396
A reality unto me.

203
00:10:20,774 --> 00:10:22,296
What are these realities, anyway?

204
00:10:23,024 --> 00:10:24,034
Delusions, maybe?

205
00:10:24,274 --> 00:10:25,847
Oh. That might be it.

206
00:10:25,872 --> 00:10:26,335
Huh?

207
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:28,252
Well, not delusions exactly.

208
00:10:28,309 --> 00:10:29,809
Those are totally unreal.

209
00:10:29,974 --> 00:10:32,336
But what about the assumptions we make about the world.

210
00:10:32,553 --> 00:10:34,125
The power of our own belief?

211
00:10:36,064 --> 00:10:37,633
The power of our own belief, huh?

212
00:10:37,676 --> 00:10:39,244
I'm only a Level 1, though.

213
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:41,859
I'm sure somebody else could explain it better.

214
00:10:42,537 --> 00:10:43,467
That was great.

215
00:10:43,492 --> 00:10:46,707
I mean, when you first used
the phrase "reality unto oneself,"

216
00:10:46,732 --> 00:10:47,697
I was confused.

217
00:10:48,404 --> 00:10:50,452
But I feel like I'm starting to understand.

218
00:10:54,107 --> 00:10:55,831
Maybe I just have to believe enough

219
00:10:56,163 --> 00:10:57,973
and then my Level will go up someday.

220
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,653
You'll be fine, Saten. I know you.

221
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:02,577
You're too stubborn to give up easily.

222
00:11:04,826 --> 00:11:06,825
Sometimes you say the rudest things.

223
00:11:06,881 --> 00:11:07,653
You know that?

224
00:11:11,272 --> 00:11:12,022
This is it.

225
00:11:14,065 --> 00:11:15,645
Well, shall we go in?

226
00:11:15,761 --> 00:11:17,344
Sissy, this doesn't concern you.

227
00:11:17,369 --> 00:11:21,114
Maybe but the people we're looking for
might recognize you as a member of Judgment.

228
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:22,269
But, I...

229
00:11:22,293 --> 00:11:23,463
Look, it'll be fine.

230
00:11:23,488 --> 00:11:25,030
Just let me handle it, okay?

231
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:27,054
You lay low at another table and wait for me.

232
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,356
What's she planning to do?

233
00:11:29,567 --> 00:11:31,965
I've got a bad feeling about this idea.

234
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:33,192
Okay, here I go!

235
00:11:33,216 --> 00:11:34,069
No, hold on!

236
00:11:34,178 --> 00:11:35,928
Please don't go in there, Sissy!

237
00:11:38,789 --> 00:11:41,315
You came here looking for
information on the Level Upper, huh?

238
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:43,982
I came across your message board

239
00:11:44,007 --> 00:11:45,540
and I thought it was super interesting,

240
00:11:45,565 --> 00:11:46,909
so I came here to ask about it

241
00:11:46,934 --> 00:11:48,686
because I know this is where you guys hang out.

242
00:11:49,134 --> 00:11:50,554
Please! I'm begging you!

243
00:11:51,207 --> 00:11:52,515
So, will you tell me?

244
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,849
Don't know what you're talkin' about.

245
00:11:54,201 --> 00:11:55,524
Now scram already.

246
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:57,482
Come on, I'm not asking very much.

247
00:11:57,554 --> 00:11:58,561
You're buggin' us.

248
00:11:58,736 --> 00:12:00,787
Shouldn't a squirt like you be in bed by now?

249
00:12:01,823 --> 00:12:03,092
This isn't working.

250
00:12:03,227 --> 00:12:05,597
I knew from the beginning it was going to fail.

251
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,630
Hey, now. I'm not as young as I look!

252
00:12:10,535 --> 00:12:13,093
You don't look like such a
little girl from where I'm sitting.

253
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,993
As a matter of fact, you're just my type.

254
00:12:15,107 --> 00:12:16,660
Aw! You really mean it?

255
00:12:17,187 --> 00:12:18,757
So about the Level Upper.

256
00:12:18,837 --> 00:12:20,196
Don't get ahead of yourself, sweetie.

257
00:12:20,265 --> 00:12:22,515
That kinda information doesn't come cheap, you know.

258
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:26,077
Oh. Well, I guess I have a little money I can give you.

259
00:12:26,101 --> 00:12:27,418
Yeah, money is great and all,

260
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:31,021
but I actually had another form of
payment in mind, if you get what I'm saying.

261
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:35,082
Hey now, don't get the wrong impression.

262
00:12:35,107 --> 00:12:36,557
I'm not that kind of girl.

263
00:12:38,446 --> 00:12:40,946
I mean, I only just met you tonight after all.

264
00:12:41,172 --> 00:12:43,071
Are you sure money won't do?

265
00:12:43,277 --> 00:12:45,678
What was that earlier about not being a little girl?

266
00:12:49,419 --> 00:12:52,401
I'm... I'm in a really rough spot right now.

267
00:12:52,732 --> 00:12:54,686
What's going on with all the sniffling?

268
00:12:56,767 --> 00:12:58,359
I don't know what to do.

269
00:12:59,107 --> 00:13:02,084
I don't have anywhere else to
turn other than the Level Upper.

270
00:13:02,684 --> 00:13:03,682
So, please.

271
00:13:04,176 --> 00:13:05,739
Won't you help me?

272
00:13:08,858 --> 00:13:10,316
Whatever, just quit crying.

273
00:13:10,341 --> 00:13:12,152
I'm just, I'm just so...

274
00:13:13,823 --> 00:13:14,763
That uniform.

275
00:13:15,314 --> 00:13:16,663
Isn't it from Tokiwadai?

276
00:13:18,396 --> 00:13:19,969
Yeah, now that you mention it.

277
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:21,437
If we play it right

278
00:13:21,462 --> 00:13:23,640
she could make for a seriously good money tree.

279
00:13:25,287 --> 00:13:26,754
Hey, uh...

280
00:13:26,936 --> 00:13:27,794
All right, kid.

281
00:13:27,962 --> 00:13:29,598
Quit crying. It's irritating me.

282
00:13:29,623 --> 00:13:30,901
We'll give you the information.

283
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:34,242
Really? Thanks so much!

284
00:13:34,424 --> 00:13:35,725
We should step outside.

285
00:13:36,945 --> 00:13:38,808
We're not gonna say anything about it in here.

286
00:13:39,065 --> 00:13:39,594
Let's go.

287
00:13:47,774 --> 00:13:48,715
Okay, then.

288
00:13:49,072 --> 00:13:50,128
This is far enough.

289
00:13:50,411 --> 00:13:52,417
Nobody's going to interfere with us out here.

290
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:53,051
Great!

291
00:13:53,304 --> 00:13:55,882
Why don't you start by giving
us all the cash you've got on you?

292
00:13:56,565 --> 00:13:59,623
Oh, and you can hand over your
debit card and PIN number, too.

293
00:14:00,198 --> 00:14:01,857
And any credit cards, of course.

294
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:04,214
Being a Tokiwadai lady, I'm sure you've got a few.

295
00:14:05,067 --> 00:14:08,854
Um, well, I did withdraw some cash before I came here,

296
00:14:08,964 --> 00:14:10,683
but I can't just give it all to you.

297
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:11,167
Oh?

298
00:14:11,819 --> 00:14:13,352
You wanna hear what we have to say?

299
00:14:13,809 --> 00:14:15,684
Then you'd better hurry and pay up.

300
00:14:15,735 --> 00:14:16,593
Do it now.

301
00:14:17,025 --> 00:14:18,724
Give us every last dime you've got

302
00:14:18,749 --> 00:14:21,474
unless you want us to strip search
you and get your money that way.

303
00:14:22,325 --> 00:14:23,429
How annoying.

304
00:14:24,198 --> 00:14:26,254
Look, just hand over the money or we'll...

305
00:14:31,565 --> 00:14:32,810
Whoa! Are you okay?

306
00:14:32,835 --> 00:14:34,500
You! You little brat!

307
00:14:34,982 --> 00:14:36,348
I've had enough of this.

308
00:14:36,587 --> 00:14:39,504
I was trying to go about this in a more civilized manner,

309
00:14:39,857 --> 00:14:41,815
but you guys had to go and get nasty.

310
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,940
Now tell me everything you know about the Level Upper.

311
00:14:43,965 --> 00:14:45,642
I'd change my tone if I were you,

312
00:14:45,928 --> 00:14:47,121
though we're happy to show you

313
00:14:47,146 --> 00:14:49,018
just what our powered-up strength can do.

314
00:14:53,156 --> 00:14:54,056
More of them.

315
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,563
Have all these guys really used this Level Upper thing?

316
00:14:58,161 --> 00:15:00,822
With this many of them at the same Level as Kaitabi...

317
00:15:01,331 --> 00:15:03,082
Yeah, I'm gonna give it to you now.

318
00:15:03,107 --> 00:15:04,171
Take my Level 2...

319
00:15:12,019 --> 00:15:13,932
There were a lot of you guys to deal with.

320
00:15:14,698 --> 00:15:17,000
I'm afraid things were bound to get a little messy.

321
00:15:18,127 --> 00:15:20,615
You really did a number on them, didn't you?

322
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:22,633
It... it's the boss!

323
00:15:22,744 --> 00:15:24,609
Hey, what's going on?

324
00:15:24,726 --> 00:15:27,160
What were you trying to do to that little lady over there?

325
00:15:27,185 --> 00:15:28,949
We're sorry, Boss.

326
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:31,637
Shamelessly trying to steal a young girl's money?

327
00:15:31,662 --> 00:15:32,548
But, Boss...

328
00:15:33,567 --> 00:15:35,947
Are you talking back to me? To me?

329
00:15:35,972 --> 00:15:36,867
I... I'm sorry!

330
00:15:36,892 --> 00:15:39,183
I'm not the one you need to apologize to.

331
00:15:39,489 --> 00:15:40,655
Go on, all of you!

332
00:15:42,777 --> 00:15:44,165
Uh, my bad. Sorry.

333
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:45,426
That's not gonna cut it.

334
00:15:45,591 --> 00:15:47,342
I sincerely apologize.

335
00:15:47,452 --> 00:15:48,297
Us, too!

336
00:15:50,373 --> 00:15:52,156
Well, that should square things, right?

337
00:15:52,571 --> 00:15:54,046
I hope you can forgive them.

338
00:15:54,717 --> 00:15:56,082
You guys! Get out of here!

339
00:15:56,115 --> 00:15:57,398
Ma'am! We're going!

340
00:15:59,187 --> 00:16:00,944
All right. So you're their boss?

341
00:16:01,097 --> 00:16:04,000
In that case, you must know
all about the Level Upper, too.

342
00:16:04,112 --> 00:16:05,606
Let's set that aside.

343
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:08,232
You gave my underlings a serious working over.

344
00:16:08,496 --> 00:16:10,446
I hope you're prepared to answer for that.

345
00:16:10,825 --> 00:16:11,780
Prepared to...

346
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:12,597
but, uh...

347
00:16:12,886 --> 00:16:14,740
you just made them apologize to me.

348
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:17,251
Well, that was that, and now this is this.

349
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:20,144
Honor demands that I pay you back for what you did.

350
00:16:21,139 --> 00:16:21,858
Let's go!

351
00:16:23,624 --> 00:16:25,083
Whoa! What's happening?

352
00:16:25,277 --> 00:16:26,522
The ground's shifting.

353
00:16:27,944 --> 00:16:29,290
That would be my ability.

354
00:16:29,315 --> 00:16:30,538
It's called Flux Coat.

355
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:34,071
With it, I have the power to
control the viscosity of the asphalt.

356
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:40,582
Whatcha gonna do?

357
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:41,789
There's nowhere to run.

358
00:16:48,054 --> 00:16:51,343
Nice try, girl, but that attack won't... What the?

359
00:16:52,232 --> 00:16:53,224
She vanished!

360
00:16:53,449 --> 00:16:54,481
That wasn't bad.

361
00:16:57,982 --> 00:17:00,329
Impossible! How are you staying up there?

362
00:17:01,006 --> 00:17:02,524
An electrical current.

363
00:17:02,607 --> 00:17:04,157
It creates a magnetic field.

364
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:07,140
All I have to do is direct it
toward the rebar in the wall.

365
00:17:07,398 --> 00:17:08,276
I'll show you!

366
00:17:17,024 --> 00:17:17,632
Well?

367
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:22,587
Do you feel like telling me what
you know yet, or shall we continue?

368
00:17:23,065 --> 00:17:24,034
I see now.

369
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:28,300
You didn't put all the power of your
ability into your first attack, did you?

370
00:17:28,482 --> 00:17:31,024
And just now you intentionally missed me

371
00:17:31,107 --> 00:17:32,283
with that blast as well.

372
00:17:32,626 --> 00:17:33,585
Exactly.

373
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:35,117
Now, be a good girl and tell me...

374
00:17:35,142 --> 00:17:37,982
Screw you! I'm not declaring defeat yet!

375
00:17:38,281 --> 00:17:40,691
If you call yourself an Esper, give me your best!

376
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:43,321
You want to try your will against mine?

377
00:17:43,346 --> 00:17:45,763
You think a little electric shock can beat me?

378
00:17:45,968 --> 00:17:48,177
Then go ahead and try. We'll see who wins!

379
00:17:54,154 --> 00:17:55,596
That sounds like a challenge.

380
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,130
Well, I'm happy to take you up on it.

381
00:18:02,982 --> 00:18:04,241
Sissy, hold on!

382
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.

383
00:18:06,825 --> 00:18:08,200
No, I really don't think you do!

384
00:18:08,399 --> 00:18:09,419
Stop, Sissy!

385
00:18:12,953 --> 00:18:15,085
Come on, Uiharu, admit it.

386
00:18:15,149 --> 00:18:17,433
You want to become a higher-level Esper, too.

387
00:18:18,186 --> 00:18:20,097
You know, like Misaka and Shirai.

388
00:18:21,861 --> 00:18:24,753
Well, having a high ability level would be pretty awesome,

389
00:18:24,971 --> 00:18:28,289
and it would offer a lot of
opportunities for academic advancement.

390
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:29,726
It's why we're here.

391
00:18:29,924 --> 00:18:33,646
If we wanted a normal school experience,
we could get that anywhere else.

392
00:18:33,938 --> 00:18:37,403
People flock to this city because
they're fascinated by Esper powers.

393
00:18:37,529 --> 00:18:39,017
That's the reason it exists.

394
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:41,880
Before I came here

395
00:18:41,944 --> 00:18:44,242
I wondered what my ability would turn out to be;

396
00:18:44,321 --> 00:18:46,938
what kind of secret power I could have hidden in me.

397
00:18:47,361 --> 00:18:50,835
I couldn't sleep the night before I
left I was so excited about it all.

398
00:18:51,202 --> 00:18:54,140
And then I had my first System Scan, and they told me,

399
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:56,624
"You have absolutely no discernible talent.

400
00:18:56,649 --> 00:18:58,397
You are a Level Zero, Saten."

401
00:18:59,629 --> 00:19:00,796
That was hard to hear.

402
00:19:02,868 --> 00:19:03,967
Really hard.

403
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:05,689
It made me sad.

404
00:19:05,888 --> 00:19:07,097
I know how you feel.

405
00:19:07,164 --> 00:19:08,258
I really do.

406
00:19:08,609 --> 00:19:11,317
I don't have much of an ability level myself, you know.

407
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,405
I'm a One.

408
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:14,452
But look at the friends I've made.

409
00:19:14,496 --> 00:19:16,789
I get to work side by side with Shirai.

410
00:19:16,835 --> 00:19:18,633
And you and I have fun all the time.

411
00:19:19,186 --> 00:19:21,310
I mean, if I hadn't come here,

412
00:19:21,335 --> 00:19:23,972
I never would have gotten the
chance to meet all of you guys.

413
00:19:24,565 --> 00:19:28,895
So, as far as I'm concerned, coming here
was a worthwhile experience if only for that.

414
00:19:29,232 --> 00:19:30,038
Uiharu.

415
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:33,220
You're adorable!

416
00:19:33,245 --> 00:19:35,341
Sometimes you say the sweetest things, you know that?

417
00:19:35,366 --> 00:19:38,154
And to say thank you, I'll sponge bathe your entire body!

418
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,956
That's okay! I can reach.

419
00:19:40,218 --> 00:19:41,157
I don't need help!

420
00:19:44,065 --> 00:19:45,098
A blackout?

421
00:19:48,169 --> 00:19:50,502
This is why I was trying to tell you not to do it.

422
00:19:50,664 --> 00:19:52,331
It's not my fault, is it?

423
00:19:52,382 --> 00:19:53,732
How was I supposed to know

424
00:19:53,757 --> 00:19:55,764
that there was something like this around here?

425
00:19:55,789 --> 00:19:57,081
Like I said, I knew there was.

426
00:19:57,106 --> 00:19:59,415
You can't just show up at the last second like that!

427
00:19:59,514 --> 00:20:01,555
And what am I gonna do about my shoes?

428
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:03,246
I'd say that's your problem.

429
00:20:05,676 --> 00:20:07,321
I guess I lost after all.

430
00:20:18,846 --> 00:20:20,262
So much for that plan.

431
00:20:20,561 --> 00:20:22,908
All that and I didn't end up with any information.

432
00:20:23,729 --> 00:20:24,478
Kuroko!

433
00:20:24,543 --> 00:20:26,710
Come on. We've got a new problem on our hands.

434
00:20:27,063 --> 00:20:29,056
Hatsuya Kaitabi is unconscious?

435
00:20:29,273 --> 00:20:30,667
I don't know all the details.

436
00:20:30,692 --> 00:20:33,442
He suddenly passed out while
Antiskill was questioning him.

437
00:20:35,005 --> 00:20:36,579
Kuroko Shirai, with Judgment.

438
00:20:36,856 --> 00:20:37,693
How is he?

439
00:20:38,086 --> 00:20:41,965
We're doing everything we can, but he
shows no signs of regaining consciousness.

440
00:20:42,293 --> 00:20:45,482
Um, well, I don't know if this
could have something to do with it,

441
00:20:45,507 --> 00:20:47,446
but I punched him pretty hard in the face.

442
00:20:47,574 --> 00:20:50,769
No. He doesn't exhibit any significant head trauma.

443
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:53,555
For that matter, we can't find
anything wrong with him at all.

444
00:20:53,884 --> 00:20:55,349
We looked him over thoroughly.

445
00:20:55,564 --> 00:20:57,269
He simply lost consciousness.

446
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,257
So you don't know what caused
it or how long it will go on.

447
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:02,150
There is one unusual thing.

448
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:05,180
This week we've had multiple patients brought in here

449
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:06,767
with the same symptoms.

450
00:21:08,968 --> 00:21:10,426
I hate to have to admit it,

451
00:21:10,501 --> 00:21:13,969
but this is beyond the capabilities
of this hospital and its staff.

452
00:21:14,009 --> 00:21:17,732
So, I've called in an outside
specialist in cerebrophysiology.

453
00:21:20,999 --> 00:21:22,519
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

454
00:21:23,837 --> 00:21:27,421
I came here at the request of the
Mizuho Systems Hospital Director.

455
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:30,438
My name is Harumi Kiyama.

456
00:21:30,918 --> 00:21:32,084
Thank you for coming.

457
00:21:32,849 --> 00:21:34,087
Why are you here?

458
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:10,297
I can't find anything concrete on the Level Upper.

459
00:23:11,034 --> 00:23:13,495
Maybe it really is nothing more than just a rumor.

460
00:23:16,156 --> 00:23:18,156
Guess I'll download some new songs on here.

461
00:23:21,382 --> 00:23:22,640
Is that a hidden link?

462
00:23:28,564 --> 00:23:29,286
Could this be?

463
00:23:30,569 --> 00:23:32,653
The Level Upper actually exists?

464
00:23:32,736 --> 00:23:35,153
Do people who use it ever go back to normal?

465
00:23:35,418 --> 00:23:37,520
Huh? I was talking to you.

466
00:23:37,664 --> 00:23:38,581
Where did you go?

467
00:23:38,638 --> 00:23:39,634
Saten?
