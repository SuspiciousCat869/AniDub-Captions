1
00:00:04,161 --> 00:00:04,896
Uiharu!

2
00:00:07,703 --> 00:00:08,755
Uiharu!

3
00:00:22,618 --> 00:00:23,998
Saten, are you all right?

4
00:00:35,066 --> 00:00:36,399
That was a close call.

5
00:00:38,973 --> 00:00:39,796
Are you injured?

6
00:00:41,267 --> 00:00:42,267
You're safe now.

7
00:00:42,995 --> 00:00:44,092
I know that lady!

8
00:02:21,769 --> 00:02:23,453
Right... No one was injured.

9
00:02:25,911 --> 00:02:29,815
And, of course, we need to make an official
announcement to keep any panic from spreading.

10
00:02:30,213 --> 00:02:31,037
As we know...

11
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:33,000
what happened wasn't the result of an earthquake.

12
00:02:33,025 --> 00:02:34,161
It was poltergeisting.

13
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:38,139
Yes... You're correct about that, girls.

14
00:02:38,164 --> 00:02:38,517
Bye.

15
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,828
I wanted to thank you personally...

16
00:02:41,256 --> 00:02:42,909
for saving my friends back there.

17
00:02:43,266 --> 00:02:45,435
I'm just relieved that nobody was injured.

18
00:02:45,594 --> 00:02:47,088
I was wondering something.

19
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:51,377
Are your people measuring the AIM
diffusion field around this area?

20
00:02:52,618 --> 00:02:56,979
Is MAR able to detect abnormalities
in the field before an event happens?

21
00:02:57,908 --> 00:02:59,895
I... well... um...

22
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:02,730
I mean, you arrived so quickly on the scene.

23
00:03:03,196 --> 00:03:04,351
Could you tell me your name?

24
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:07,322
Yes... I'm Kuroko Shirai,

25
00:03:07,347 --> 00:03:10,031
of Tokiwadai and Judgment Branch 177.

26
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:11,065
That explains it.

27
00:03:11,248 --> 00:03:15,300
It seems your branch in particular has
some outstanding officers working for it.

28
00:03:15,814 --> 00:03:19,503
There is a connection between
AIM diffusion fields and RSPK.

29
00:03:19,911 --> 00:03:21,642
It's impressive that you've already found it.

30
00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:27,846
From what we can tell, the RSPK incidents are being
caused by someone tampering with AIM diffusion fields,

31
00:03:27,943 --> 00:03:31,278
and these synchronized events are
leading to the poltergeisting we've seen.

32
00:03:32,143 --> 00:03:35,440
It would have been helpful if you'd
mentioned this at the joint conference earlier,

33
00:03:35,497 --> 00:03:39,738
that way I would have known to be on the lookout
for any suspicious persons in the area at the time.

34
00:03:39,763 --> 00:03:41,932
That's under Antiskill's jurisdiction.

35
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:43,688
I thought I was clear before.

36
00:03:43,803 --> 00:03:49,088
We want Judgment to focus on countering rumors and
managing matters of day-to-day safety within the city.

37
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:51,950
Tampering with AIM diffusion fields.

38
00:03:52,659 --> 00:03:56,248
We know somebody who has done just
that. Could this be her work, also?

39
00:03:56,657 --> 00:03:57,272
Whose work?

40
00:03:57,718 --> 00:03:58,488
Misaka!

41
00:03:59,927 --> 00:04:02,462
We're going to ride along to the hospital with Haru'ue.

42
00:04:02,487 --> 00:04:03,921
Oh... we'll come, too.

43
00:04:03,946 --> 00:04:05,592
Unfortunately, we can't do that.

44
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:07,637
The head resident will be doing room check.

45
00:04:10,757 --> 00:04:11,623
What a relief.

46
00:04:11,807 --> 00:04:12,996
Thanks for letting us know.

47
00:04:13,573 --> 00:04:14,163
Goodnight.

48
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,596
She's gonna be fine.

49
00:04:16,842 --> 00:04:18,883
They've all made it safely back to the dorm.

50
00:04:24,946 --> 00:04:26,113
So... Tell me, Sissy.

51
00:04:26,138 --> 00:04:28,798
What has captured your attention so completely?

52
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:30,950
The Level Upper fiasco?

53
00:04:31,335 --> 00:04:32,587
Why are you looking at that?

54
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,201
It's just a hunch I have.

55
00:04:34,335 --> 00:04:37,347
There's something about the current
situation that reminds me of it.

56
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:41,953
The manipulation of AIM diffusion fields
was a big part of that incident as well.

57
00:04:42,036 --> 00:04:43,012
What's more...

58
00:04:43,037 --> 00:04:45,451
I'm still not going to be choosy about my methods.

59
00:04:46,683 --> 00:04:48,453
If you don't like the plan I come up with,

60
00:04:48,536 --> 00:04:50,036
you'll have to come and stop me again.

61
00:04:51,675 --> 00:04:52,942
I see what you mean.

62
00:04:53,578 --> 00:04:57,407
You're thinking that Kiyama might be
involved in the recent spate of poltergeisting.

63
00:04:58,004 --> 00:04:59,385
I understand why,

64
00:04:59,452 --> 00:05:01,682
but aren't you forgetting one important detail?

65
00:05:02,257 --> 00:05:06,887
The woman in question is currently a resident of
the detention center in School District Seventeen.

66
00:05:07,147 --> 00:05:11,470
There's no way a high-profile criminal
like Kiyama would be able to get out of there.

67
00:05:11,562 --> 00:05:12,973
Yeah, you're probably right.

68
00:05:12,998 --> 00:05:15,778
There is something else about
all this that concerns me, though.

69
00:05:16,532 --> 00:05:17,000
Yeah?

70
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:19,813
The way Haru'ue was behaving at the fireworks show.

71
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:20,974
Where?

72
00:05:23,335 --> 00:05:24,262
Where are you...?

73
00:05:24,597 --> 00:05:25,519
Please, where?

74
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:27,606
Yeah, you're right.

75
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:31,651
It's kind of like she was talking
to somebody who wasn't even there.

76
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:34,058
All right, let's think through the situation.

77
00:05:34,453 --> 00:05:37,991
We know this is the result of
someone tampering with AIM fields...

78
00:05:38,578 --> 00:05:40,828
which means it has to be the work of an Esper.

79
00:05:41,411 --> 00:05:42,627
Wait, you aren't saying...

80
00:05:42,652 --> 00:05:45,077
I know... It's a horrible thing to think about.

81
00:05:45,102 --> 00:05:46,270
I'll comfort you, Sissy!

82
00:05:46,295 --> 00:05:47,019
Get off me!

83
00:05:47,292 --> 00:05:49,448
How could something like that even be possible?

84
00:05:49,473 --> 00:05:52,897
Haru'ue only recently transferred
into our school district, remember?

85
00:05:53,377 --> 00:05:54,095
Although...

86
00:05:54,257 --> 00:05:56,272
You're from District Nineteen, right, Haru'ue?

87
00:05:56,297 --> 00:05:58,853
Weren't there several
poltergeisting outbreaks in that area?

88
00:05:59,102 --> 00:05:59,868
What was it like?

89
00:06:01,328 --> 00:06:03,120
I think Saten's onto something.

90
00:06:03,778 --> 00:06:08,054
Poltergeisting incidents in District Nineteen
have stopped completely for a short while.

91
00:06:08,238 --> 00:06:10,928
And, in the meantime... here in District Seven...

92
00:06:11,177 --> 00:06:12,639
That's a coincidence!

93
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:16,285
You really think a sweet little girl
like her could have anything to do with this?

94
00:06:16,472 --> 00:06:17,771
You're right. There's no way.

95
00:06:18,094 --> 00:06:21,418
It's my Judgment training
making me suspicious of everybody.

96
00:06:21,804 --> 00:06:24,093
It's just, after that call from Konori, I...

97
00:06:24,481 --> 00:06:24,985
Uh...

98
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,423
Hello, Konori.

99
00:06:33,573 --> 00:06:34,797
I hope I'm not disturbing you...

100
00:06:34,822 --> 00:06:35,671
Oh, Shirai?!

101
00:06:35,801 --> 00:06:36,334
Are you okay?

102
00:06:36,366 --> 00:06:36,823
Yes.

103
00:06:37,192 --> 00:06:38,650
Why didn't you call and tell me?

104
00:06:38,805 --> 00:06:39,928
You're always doing stuff like this!

105
00:06:39,953 --> 00:06:40,803
'Night, Konori!

106
00:06:42,242 --> 00:06:43,661
I'm glad she's sleeping.

107
00:06:44,077 --> 00:06:47,110
I'm sorry you had to come all
the way here after the hospital.

108
00:06:47,135 --> 00:06:48,742
Oh, please, don't worry about it.

109
00:06:48,767 --> 00:06:50,902
It's not like any of this is your fault, you know.

110
00:06:50,964 --> 00:06:53,833
Besides, if she's your roommate,
that makes her my friend, too.

111
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:58,798
It seems like I have to keep coming to
you for help over and over again today, huh?

112
00:06:58,823 --> 00:06:59,864
Well, that's nothing new.

113
00:07:02,829 --> 00:07:04,621
I am a little worried about her, though.

114
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:05,741
You know what I mean?

115
00:07:06,121 --> 00:07:08,974
She still doesn't remember
anything at all about the earthquake.

116
00:07:09,008 --> 00:07:11,732
Yes. I think she's in a mild state of shock.

117
00:07:11,888 --> 00:07:15,109
That's what the doctor at the
hospital said, and it seems to be true.

118
00:07:15,704 --> 00:07:17,318
It was pretty scary, huh?

119
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:18,850
Yeah.

120
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:22,855
Well, at least the fireworks show was awesome...

121
00:07:23,061 --> 00:07:24,500
and nobody got badly hurt.

122
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,591
Now... you take excellent care of Haru'ue, you hear me?

123
00:07:27,616 --> 00:07:29,325
Yep, you just leave it to me!

124
00:07:29,419 --> 00:07:31,095
Oh... one more thing.

125
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:33,706
Thanks for all your help tonight.

126
00:07:43,476 --> 00:07:45,387
Oh... I didn't know you were up.

127
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,525
What? Where am I?

128
00:07:46,729 --> 00:07:48,040
Back in our dorm room...

129
00:07:48,311 --> 00:07:51,253
How are you feeling? Can I get
you something to drink or anything?

130
00:07:54,067 --> 00:07:57,216
I'm sorry. I hope I wasn't too much trouble tonight.

131
00:07:58,993 --> 00:08:01,089
No trouble at all, I promise you.

132
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:04,956
I'm strange. I know that.

133
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:08,345
Now other people know, too,
and they don't like me anymore.

134
00:08:08,381 --> 00:08:09,691
That's not going to happen!

135
00:08:10,501 --> 00:08:13,584
For one thing... you've got me
and I still like you just fine.

136
00:08:13,905 --> 00:08:15,571
Oh I can't believe I almost forgot!

137
00:08:15,831 --> 00:08:18,319
Saten brought you a get-well treat to cheer you up.

138
00:08:18,608 --> 00:08:19,858
Hold on just a second.

139
00:08:29,295 --> 00:08:30,381
It's delicious.

140
00:08:30,406 --> 00:08:32,518
Apparently, this came from outside the city.

141
00:08:32,911 --> 00:08:36,935
Saten says the ones we have here are too
bland, and she wanted you to have the best!

142
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:38,993
She's really nice.

143
00:08:39,812 --> 00:08:43,315
Both you and Saten and the others... all of you.

144
00:08:44,067 --> 00:08:45,636
You've helped me so much.

145
00:08:45,706 --> 00:08:46,912
I can't do anything.

146
00:08:47,797 --> 00:08:49,502
All I'm good at is waiting.

147
00:08:50,305 --> 00:08:52,617
I hate being like this, but it's true.

148
00:08:53,237 --> 00:08:54,909
I wish I could change.

149
00:08:58,499 --> 00:08:59,432
Don't give up.

150
00:08:59,475 --> 00:09:00,704
You can change.

151
00:09:01,313 --> 00:09:05,193
I would never have become a Judgment
officer without all my friends helping me.

152
00:09:05,634 --> 00:09:06,884
We're on your side now.

153
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,293
We're going to help you.

154
00:09:08,627 --> 00:09:10,261
So you'll be just fine.

155
00:09:11,099 --> 00:09:13,224
Really? You think I can change?

156
00:09:13,373 --> 00:09:15,998
Of course. In fact, I guarantee it.

157
00:09:16,392 --> 00:09:18,834
Now, eat your watermelon. It'll make you feel better.

158
00:09:20,007 --> 00:09:21,337
You're at Nature Park?

159
00:09:21,918 --> 00:09:23,277
Together with Haru'ue?

160
00:09:23,637 --> 00:09:24,753
That isn't fair!

161
00:09:24,844 --> 00:09:27,010
Why didn't you invite me to come along with you?

162
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:29,844
I didn't even know you were off Judgment duty already.

163
00:09:31,969 --> 00:09:32,889
I'm sorry.

164
00:09:33,312 --> 00:09:35,400
I thought... breathing fresh air...

165
00:09:35,751 --> 00:09:37,439
would be nice, for a change.

166
00:09:39,761 --> 00:09:41,439
Have you overdosed on fresh air?

167
00:09:41,854 --> 00:09:42,965
You're way out of breath.

168
00:09:43,304 --> 00:09:44,425
I'm fine, really.

169
00:09:46,046 --> 00:09:46,769
A... okay.

170
00:09:48,485 --> 00:09:49,735
Just dandy.

171
00:09:52,245 --> 00:09:52,975
Aw.

172
00:09:53,424 --> 00:09:55,857
I dropped by to hang out with
her, and she's blowing me off.

173
00:09:56,127 --> 00:09:58,927
Well, this isn't exactly a place
where people come to hang out.

174
00:09:59,857 --> 00:10:00,938
I'm sorry about that.

175
00:10:01,195 --> 00:10:04,210
I know! Why don't I go out and
get some snacks for us to share?

176
00:10:04,442 --> 00:10:05,942
A snack would be nice.

177
00:10:06,448 --> 00:10:09,857
How about some ramen, some fried rice, a seafood sampler

178
00:10:10,099 --> 00:10:11,845
and let's see, what else sounds good?

179
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:12,583
You're hungry, huh?

180
00:10:12,608 --> 00:10:14,441
Oh, and how about some spring rolls, too.

181
00:10:14,577 --> 00:10:16,040
You know, the kind with shrimp in them.

182
00:10:16,072 --> 00:10:18,200
Uh, you do know I'm not paying for all this, right?

183
00:10:18,225 --> 00:10:19,598
You know, I don't feel good about this.

184
00:10:19,731 --> 00:10:20,305
Yeah.

185
00:10:20,852 --> 00:10:24,420
Same here... but we have to do it if we
want to clear Haru'ue's name, right...?

186
00:10:24,631 --> 00:10:25,381
There's no choice.

187
00:10:25,406 --> 00:10:26,130
Yeah, okay.

188
00:10:31,446 --> 00:10:32,216
There she is.

189
00:10:32,446 --> 00:10:34,487
It looks like her ability is telepathy.

190
00:10:35,328 --> 00:10:37,417
Psychological responsiveness.

191
00:10:37,935 --> 00:10:39,277
But she's still a Level 2.

192
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:41,583
Which basically means she can't utilize it at all.

193
00:10:41,848 --> 00:10:42,884
There, you see!

194
00:10:43,067 --> 00:10:45,514
Haru'ue doesn't have anything
to do with the poltergeisting...

195
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:48,495
I knew we were getting ourselves
all worked up about nothing.

196
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,232
Wait, Sissy...

197
00:10:50,111 --> 00:10:50,963
Look at this.

198
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:04,093
Ah! That breeze feels so good!

199
00:11:07,561 --> 00:11:10,230
Have you noticed food tastes better when you eat outside?

200
00:11:10,327 --> 00:11:12,890
I guess that's why people like going on picnics.

201
00:11:15,672 --> 00:11:17,643
Um... about the other night.

202
00:11:18,834 --> 00:11:21,043
I've been thinking a lot about what you said.

203
00:11:21,321 --> 00:11:23,665
How you told me I could change if I wanted to

204
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:26,065
and how you'd be there to help me if I tried.

205
00:11:26,903 --> 00:11:28,464
Well, I've made a decision.

206
00:11:29,315 --> 00:11:31,514
I want... I want to change, really.

207
00:11:32,093 --> 00:11:33,501
That's a big choice to make.

208
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:36,203
Yes, but I think it's the right one.

209
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:37,920
And there's something else I want to tell you.

210
00:11:39,217 --> 00:11:40,158
You see, I...

211
00:11:40,836 --> 00:11:42,370
I'm looking for a friend.

212
00:11:43,682 --> 00:11:45,728
We were friends for a long time...

213
00:11:46,011 --> 00:11:47,644
always by each other's side.

214
00:11:48,481 --> 00:11:49,501
But then one day...

215
00:11:49,763 --> 00:11:50,861
we got split up.

216
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:55,325
She made me promise that someday, no matter what...

217
00:11:55,646 --> 00:11:56,843
we'd meet up again.

218
00:11:57,613 --> 00:11:59,489
All this time... I've been waiting.

219
00:12:00,382 --> 00:12:01,530
But I've made up my mind.

220
00:12:01,776 --> 00:12:03,568
Waiting isn't good enough anymore.

221
00:12:03,713 --> 00:12:05,924
I need to actually start looking for her.

222
00:12:06,695 --> 00:12:09,920
I'm here... but who knows where she is?

223
00:12:13,077 --> 00:12:15,648
Okay, Haru'ue, we'll look for your friend together.

224
00:12:16,521 --> 00:12:17,938
And I'm sure we'll find her.

225
00:12:18,052 --> 00:12:18,944
Don't you worry!

226
00:12:19,724 --> 00:12:21,066
Thank you so much.

227
00:12:25,196 --> 00:12:26,660
What is it? What are you doing?

228
00:12:26,685 --> 00:12:28,861
I can't find you. Where are you?

229
00:12:28,935 --> 00:12:30,031
Why are you hurting?

230
00:12:30,526 --> 00:12:31,777
Please, listen to me!

231
00:12:31,802 --> 00:12:32,795
What's going on?

232
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:33,502
Haru'ue!

233
00:12:33,621 --> 00:12:34,446
Where are you?

234
00:12:35,228 --> 00:12:36,000
What the...

235
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:47,383
Not again!

236
00:12:52,979 --> 00:12:53,983
What's that beeping?

237
00:12:54,016 --> 00:12:56,018
No, I'm telling you, it's better than you think.

238
00:12:56,043 --> 00:12:57,178
I'll get some for us.

239
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,967
A large-scale poltergeist event!

240
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,602
Out in Nature Park?

241
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:04,820
That's where Uiharu and Haru'ue are!

242
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:36,062
What's the casualty count?

243
00:13:36,305 --> 00:13:39,500
72 people injured... eighteen of them seriously...

244
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:41,780
No fatalities as of yet.

245
00:13:41,937 --> 00:13:43,972
Continue with the rescue operation.

246
00:13:44,266 --> 00:13:44,821
Yes, ma'am.

247
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:50,700
It's true. You really couldn't distinguish
this from the aftermath of an actual earthquake.

248
00:13:50,725 --> 00:13:51,870
Please just come with me.

249
00:13:51,895 --> 00:13:53,149
It's okay. You can let me go.

250
00:13:53,174 --> 00:13:54,480
I'm a Judgment officer.

251
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:57,057
Please, just let me see what I can do to help out.

252
00:13:57,082 --> 00:13:57,642
It's you.

253
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:59,695
You were at the last one.

254
00:13:59,945 --> 00:14:01,543
Miss Therestina? You're here?

255
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:07,588
Uiharu!

256
00:14:09,221 --> 00:14:10,203
Hi, guys.

257
00:14:11,203 --> 00:14:12,717
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

258
00:14:13,038 --> 00:14:14,433
Sorry you came down here.

259
00:14:14,631 --> 00:14:15,973
As you can see, I'm fine.

260
00:14:16,128 --> 00:14:17,912
It's just a little scrape, that's all.

261
00:14:18,702 --> 00:14:21,473
I told them it wasn't a big deal, but they still insisted.

262
00:14:21,798 --> 00:14:22,756
I'm glad you're okay.

263
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:23,781
You could have called...

264
00:14:23,923 --> 00:14:25,223
We were worried about you!

265
00:14:25,248 --> 00:14:28,194
You got caught in poltergeisting
events two times in a row!

266
00:14:28,336 --> 00:14:31,253
You and Haru'ue must be the
unluckiest people in Academy City!

267
00:14:31,932 --> 00:14:34,153
Now that I think about it, where is Haru'ue?

268
00:14:34,729 --> 00:14:38,285
She was evacuated before me, so
she must be around here somewhere.

269
00:14:38,512 --> 00:14:40,001
It's okay, though, she' not hurt...

270
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,383
She just passed out.

271
00:14:42,328 --> 00:14:43,256
That's a relief.

272
00:14:43,306 --> 00:14:45,141
It could've been a lot worse than that.

273
00:14:45,554 --> 00:14:46,355
Uiharu.

274
00:14:46,953 --> 00:14:48,612
Think back to right before it happened.

275
00:14:49,049 --> 00:14:52,068
Do you remember Haru'ue behaving strangely in any way?

276
00:14:52,831 --> 00:14:55,419
You know, like what happened
to her during the fireworks show.

277
00:14:55,854 --> 00:14:57,598
Well, uh... why are you asking?

278
00:14:57,623 --> 00:14:59,148
According to my investigation,

279
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:03,128
Haru'ue is a Level Two telepath with
some irregularities in her ability.

280
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:06,870
If you observed any suspicious behavior, like
what happened before, then you need to tell me...

281
00:15:06,953 --> 00:15:07,529
Why?

282
00:15:08,245 --> 00:15:08,609
Huh?

283
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,851
Why would you be investigating Haru'ue?

284
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:13,178
Oh, well, you see...

285
00:15:13,281 --> 00:15:14,154
No way.

286
00:15:14,388 --> 00:15:17,173
You can't suspect Haru'ue of being involved in this.

287
00:15:17,745 --> 00:15:19,995
Well. Suspect is a strong word.

288
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,576
How could you do this, Shirai?

289
00:15:22,119 --> 00:15:24,173
Haru'ue just transferred to our District.

290
00:15:24,508 --> 00:15:27,176
She's nervous, and she's relying on us to help her...

291
00:15:27,411 --> 00:15:28,226
and yet, you...

292
00:15:29,694 --> 00:15:30,488
You're horrible!

293
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:32,199
Whoa, take it easy, Uiharu.

294
00:15:32,674 --> 00:15:35,295
Listen, to her, Uiharu. Kuroko didn't mean t...

295
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:39,880
It's certainly possible that a telepath is
the one tampering with the AIM diffusion fields.

296
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,220
We can't write it off.

297
00:15:41,245 --> 00:15:42,662
Oh, I didn't see you there.

298
00:15:44,299 --> 00:15:46,245
It doesn't look like they can take any more here.

299
00:15:46,944 --> 00:15:49,773
Have the rest of the injured sent
to the hospital in District Fifteen.

300
00:15:50,101 --> 00:15:50,569
Right.

301
00:15:51,633 --> 00:15:52,209
What now?

302
00:15:52,233 --> 00:15:53,064
As I was saying,

303
00:15:53,201 --> 00:15:57,162
a telepath could indeed be responsible, but
they would have to be a Level Four at least

304
00:15:57,187 --> 00:15:59,991
and the number of people who
fit that description is very small.

305
00:16:00,321 --> 00:16:03,717
The chance of a Level Two managing
such a feat is practically zero.

306
00:16:04,001 --> 00:16:06,989
But I still think we should look
into this, just to be on the safe side.

307
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:08,857
Who is this friend of yours?

308
00:16:09,073 --> 00:16:11,026
A transfer student: Erii Haru'ue

309
00:16:11,184 --> 00:16:12,153
How could you?!

310
00:16:12,239 --> 00:16:14,727
We're sending one victim to the lab at headquarters.

311
00:16:14,872 --> 00:16:15,923
Have a car brought around.

312
00:16:16,372 --> 00:16:17,046
Please, no!

313
00:16:17,071 --> 00:16:19,017
Just think of this as proving her innocence.

314
00:16:20,014 --> 00:16:21,035
It will be all right.

315
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:23,800
We have an excellent staff of specialists at the lab.

316
00:16:23,911 --> 00:16:25,165
She's in good hands.

317
00:16:25,415 --> 00:16:28,057
And, you know, you shouldn't shout in a hospital.

318
00:16:38,203 --> 00:16:39,241
Here, have a drink.

319
00:16:41,677 --> 00:16:43,185
No thanks, I'm not thirsty.

320
00:16:44,945 --> 00:16:46,198
Take it already.

321
00:16:46,223 --> 00:16:48,104
Oh, hey... is that watermelon tea?

322
00:16:48,129 --> 00:16:51,186
That's perfect! I'm dying of
thirst over here. Thanks a lot!

323
00:16:51,482 --> 00:16:52,514
Have one, Kuroko.

324
00:16:57,053 --> 00:16:58,361
The exam is complete.

325
00:16:59,595 --> 00:17:01,355
Is it...? Great...! Where is she?

326
00:17:01,706 --> 00:17:02,890
Please calm yourself.

327
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:05,216
It will still be a little while before we get the results.

328
00:17:05,271 --> 00:17:06,344
Now. Follow me.

329
00:17:18,679 --> 00:17:19,528
Wow.

330
00:17:20,142 --> 00:17:22,559
This doesn't really look much
like a laboratory, does it...?

331
00:17:22,584 --> 00:17:24,501
It's not decorated like one, anyway.

332
00:17:30,335 --> 00:17:32,698
In this job you see a lot of pain and suffering.

333
00:17:33,129 --> 00:17:36,195
It's nice to remember there are still
pure, beautiful things in the world.

334
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:39,158
Huh? You mean, this stuff is all you?

335
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:40,993
Sure... I was the decorator.

336
00:17:42,077 --> 00:17:44,786
All right. Shall we have some introductions?

337
00:17:45,028 --> 00:17:48,375
I'm Therestina, director of the
Multi Active Rescue Laboratory.

338
00:17:49,773 --> 00:17:50,908
The director?!

339
00:17:51,178 --> 00:17:52,269
Do I have this right?

340
00:17:52,294 --> 00:17:56,096
You're the commander of the Multi Active
Rescue team, the director of the entire lab.

341
00:17:56,121 --> 00:17:57,131
I think that's it.

342
00:17:57,657 --> 00:17:59,077
Or do you have more titles?

343
00:17:59,786 --> 00:18:00,720
No, that's all.

344
00:18:01,093 --> 00:18:02,135
And what about you?

345
00:18:02,317 --> 00:18:04,947
Except for Shirai there, I don't know any of your names.

346
00:18:05,397 --> 00:18:06,433
Tell me who you are.

347
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:08,888
Oh right, sorry. My name's Mikoto Misaka.

348
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:10,795
From Tokiwadai Girls' school?

349
00:18:11,029 --> 00:18:14,537
What an unexpected honor to have
the famous Railgun here in my own lab.

350
00:18:14,828 --> 00:18:16,262
No... really...

351
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:16,935
And...

352
00:18:17,264 --> 00:18:20,053
Oh... I'm Ruiko Saten. Uh. Hi.

353
00:18:20,078 --> 00:18:21,473
Are you at Tokiwadai, too?

354
00:18:21,831 --> 00:18:23,498
No, I'm at Sakugawa.

355
00:18:23,549 --> 00:18:27,503
If you're friends with somebody like Misaka,
you must be quite an Esper in your own right.

356
00:18:27,933 --> 00:18:29,261
No... actually...

357
00:18:29,286 --> 00:18:29,958
I'm not.

358
00:18:30,571 --> 00:18:31,497
Well, no matter...

359
00:18:31,712 --> 00:18:32,667
Nice to meet you.

360
00:18:32,764 --> 00:18:34,908
Oh... it's a pleasure to meet you, too.

361
00:18:35,203 --> 00:18:35,946
And you are?

362
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:39,262
Kazari Uiharu. officer with Judgment Branch 177.

363
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:40,300
I see...

364
00:18:40,503 --> 00:18:41,453
So you and Shirai are...

365
00:18:41,478 --> 00:18:44,536
Please! Haru'ue's not the person you're looking for.

366
00:18:44,772 --> 00:18:46,467
She's not some kind of criminal!

367
00:18:47,671 --> 00:18:48,708
Let's try something.

368
00:18:49,932 --> 00:18:51,472
Tell me, what's your favorite color?

369
00:18:52,387 --> 00:18:53,958
I like all colors, really...

370
00:18:54,332 --> 00:18:56,048
If I have to pick, I guess yellow.

371
00:18:56,252 --> 00:18:57,423
Yellow, is it?

372
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:00,179
Well... we shall see.

373
00:19:00,892 --> 00:19:02,517
What are you doing, exactly?

374
00:19:03,931 --> 00:19:04,351
There.

375
00:19:05,506 --> 00:19:06,902
I'd say that's a good sign.

376
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:07,918
Huh?

377
00:19:09,418 --> 00:19:10,357
Excuse me!

378
00:19:10,743 --> 00:19:12,344
You would dare to assault me?

379
00:19:12,393 --> 00:19:14,997
You do know that I am Mitsuko Kongo of Tokiwadai?

380
00:19:15,421 --> 00:19:16,450
There's no assault.

381
00:19:16,915 --> 00:19:18,088
Please, just listen...

382
00:19:18,113 --> 00:19:21,949
As we've been trying to explain, cases of
poltergeisting among Level Fours are quite rare,

383
00:19:21,974 --> 00:19:22,879
so further examination...

384
00:19:22,904 --> 00:19:25,318
And as I've explained, no exam is necessary.

385
00:19:25,356 --> 00:19:27,137
There is absolutely nothing wrong with me...

386
00:19:27,262 --> 00:19:28,861
Ecaterina is waiting, so...

387
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:32,415
That's Shirai.

388
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:35,717
Shirai, Misaka, can you hear me?

389
00:19:35,742 --> 00:19:36,504
Quick, hold her down!

390
00:19:37,206 --> 00:19:38,378
Wait, what are you...

391
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:39,628
Is something the matter?

392
00:19:40,557 --> 00:19:41,898
No... it's nothing.

393
00:19:49,113 --> 00:19:50,129
That's Haru'ue!

394
00:19:50,602 --> 00:19:51,358
Results in?

395
00:19:51,465 --> 00:19:51,885
Yes.

396
00:19:52,578 --> 00:19:53,378
Let's see here.

397
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:55,977
Well? What is it?

398
00:19:58,121 --> 00:19:59,352
You can relax now.

399
00:19:59,832 --> 00:20:01,562
She isn't the person we're looking for.

400
00:20:03,037 --> 00:20:04,041
You were right about her.

401
00:20:04,066 --> 00:20:05,679
She is a Level Two telepath.

402
00:20:05,867 --> 00:20:09,580
What's more, she's only a receiver and
unable to send out any messages herself.

403
00:20:10,012 --> 00:20:12,410
But what about the note in her record in the database

404
00:20:12,435 --> 00:20:16,904
saying she exhibited "anomalistic ability
above her level under specific wavelengths?"

405
00:20:16,929 --> 00:20:18,740
Be quiet! Let it go!

406
00:20:19,002 --> 00:20:20,961
Our examination was quite thorough.

407
00:20:21,075 --> 00:20:23,951
We found that she is limited
to a select number of partners.

408
00:20:24,212 --> 00:20:28,036
She can pick up on those people regardless
of the distance or any obstacles in the way,

409
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:29,727
but she can't hear anybody else.

410
00:20:30,155 --> 00:20:31,276
Whatever the case.

411
00:20:31,443 --> 00:20:34,810
It simply isn't possible for
her to tamper with AIM fields.

412
00:20:34,954 --> 00:20:36,583
You see? Told you.

413
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,712
I was only doing my job.

414
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:43,097
So... If it's not her, then who is
the one behind the poltergeisting?

415
00:20:48,758 --> 00:20:49,812
Hi, Haru'ue.

416
00:20:51,423 --> 00:20:52,957
Oh... Uiharu...

417
00:20:53,461 --> 00:20:55,461
I guess I passed out again.

418
00:20:55,905 --> 00:20:56,572
It's okay.

419
00:20:56,829 --> 00:20:58,114
Everything's okay.

420
00:20:58,328 --> 00:21:00,578
You don't have anything to worry about now!

421
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:06,370
Here.

422
00:21:08,302 --> 00:21:10,373
This pendant is important to you, isn't it?

423
00:21:11,273 --> 00:21:14,051
Yes... it's a memento of a good friend.

424
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:17,253
You mean the one you told me you were looking for earlier?

425
00:21:17,578 --> 00:21:18,745
Yes, that's right.

426
00:21:18,828 --> 00:21:19,870
I can hear her.

427
00:21:19,912 --> 00:21:20,796
Like her voice?

428
00:21:22,129 --> 00:21:23,888
That sounds like telepathy to me.

429
00:21:24,178 --> 00:21:25,842
It's only once in a while.

430
00:21:26,219 --> 00:21:27,487
But when I do hear it.

431
00:21:27,714 --> 00:21:29,520
I get lost in it somehow.

432
00:21:29,901 --> 00:21:31,800
So that's what those attacks are.

433
00:21:32,381 --> 00:21:34,445
Is there a photograph inside the pendant?

434
00:21:35,536 --> 00:21:36,027
Yes.

435
00:21:39,205 --> 00:21:41,523
See. Her name's Banri Edasaki.

436
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:42,724
It's that girl!

437
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,474
I've seen her before.

438
00:21:48,356 --> 00:21:49,779
You know who Banri is?

439
00:21:52,351 --> 00:21:53,172
Well, I...

440
00:21:54,037 --> 00:21:55,166
There's something else.

441
00:21:56,308 --> 00:21:57,073
I'm like her.

442
00:21:58,297 --> 00:21:59,956
I'm a Child Error, too.

443
00:23:30,778 --> 00:23:32,588
So, Haru'ue is a Child Error.

444
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:35,598
Kuroko and Uiharu aren't exactly on the best of terms.

445
00:23:35,939 --> 00:23:37,331
I guess it's up to me to...

446
00:23:37,684 --> 00:23:38,934
Wait! You again?!
