1
00:00:07,724 --> 00:00:08,691
Who do you think you are?

2
00:00:08,969 --> 00:00:10,136
Trying to assault me?

3
00:00:10,391 --> 00:00:13,673
You should know that I am Mitsuko
Kongo of Tokiwadai Middle School.

4
00:00:14,541 --> 00:00:15,485
"Assault" you?

5
00:00:16,382 --> 00:00:20,641
One of Tokiwadai's darlings would bust out
the fancy words instead of talking normal.

6
00:00:20,724 --> 00:00:21,267
Huh?

7
00:00:22,815 --> 00:00:25,719
How sad that you have such a feeble grasp of the language.

8
00:00:26,227 --> 00:00:28,244
Well, I'll be happy to teach you a thing or two.

9
00:00:32,956 --> 00:00:33,934
Aw, what's wrong...?

10
00:00:34,227 --> 00:00:35,729
Does the little girl have a headache?

11
00:00:36,116 --> 00:00:37,086
What's happening?

12
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:43,361
Hurts, doesn't it?

13
00:00:43,386 --> 00:00:44,168
Who are you?

14
00:00:46,682 --> 00:00:47,398
Hey, now...

15
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,678
picking on young girls, are we?

16
00:00:51,229 --> 00:00:52,682
Well, we can't have that.

17
00:00:55,182 --> 00:00:56,482
Who's... there?

18
00:01:01,732 --> 00:01:05,720
Maybe this marks the end of the recent
outbreak of esper hunts conducted by Skill Out.

19
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:08,390
Though that could be too much to hope for.

20
00:01:09,459 --> 00:01:12,123
Going after somebody like Kongo was a gutsy move.

21
00:01:12,537 --> 00:01:17,025
No matter how many of them ganged up, Level
Zeroes wouldn't be a match for a Level Four Esper.

22
00:01:17,407 --> 00:01:19,266
I guess they learned that lesson the hard way...

23
00:01:19,657 --> 00:01:21,895
Unless they're stupider than they look, of course.

24
00:01:22,175 --> 00:01:23,358
That isn't how it happened.

25
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,138
It's all in Kongo's report...

26
00:01:26,449 --> 00:01:29,277
For some reason, she wasn't able to use her esper ability.

27
00:01:29,758 --> 00:01:32,082
Fortunately, some stranger appeared and helped her.

28
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:34,321
Tamezo?

29
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:36,953
What? Is something wrong?

30
00:01:38,007 --> 00:01:39,094
Huh...? Sorry...

31
00:01:39,533 --> 00:01:40,105
Let's see...

32
00:01:40,382 --> 00:01:42,949
Maybe Uiharu's questioning will produce something.

33
00:01:43,057 --> 00:01:43,711
Yes.

34
00:01:44,269 --> 00:01:47,254
And after that, I don't know
what happened. I just passed out.

35
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:50,307
And when you came to again, your
attackers were all on the ground?

36
00:01:50,557 --> 00:01:51,063
Yeah.

37
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:54,304
Can you remember anything else about what happened?

38
00:01:54,441 --> 00:01:55,391
Well, maybe...

39
00:01:56,072 --> 00:01:58,007
I don't know what they're called, exactly...

40
00:01:58,237 --> 00:02:00,136
It's a particular kind of garment...

41
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,862
Something you would generally see on
men who ride motorcycles and the like.

42
00:02:03,894 --> 00:02:04,982
A leather jacket?

43
00:02:05,429 --> 00:02:06,961
Yes! That's what it was!

44
00:02:07,797 --> 00:02:09,288
A black leather jacket!

45
00:02:09,519 --> 00:02:14,149
And the gentleman who was carrying it had what
looked like a large black spider tattooed on his back.

46
00:02:16,991 --> 00:02:18,283
Are you sure you're okay?

47
00:02:18,557 --> 00:02:20,074
You seem sort of distracted...

48
00:02:20,387 --> 00:02:22,029
If there's something wrong, just tell me.

49
00:02:22,054 --> 00:02:23,659
Oh, no... it's nothing.

50
00:02:25,001 --> 00:02:28,284
So, we have a man with a leather
jacket and a black spider tattoo...

51
00:02:28,945 --> 00:02:31,072
Could he be the one who beat all these punks up?

52
00:04:06,008 --> 00:04:07,024
Big Spider?

53
00:04:07,813 --> 00:04:11,088
That's the name of the group that's
been carrying out all these Esper hunts?

54
00:04:11,113 --> 00:04:12,353
Who are they, exactly?

55
00:04:12,803 --> 00:04:17,788
Big Spider has always been a fairly well-known
organization, even within the members of Skill Out.

56
00:04:18,193 --> 00:04:20,514
At one time, they had their own sense of pride.

57
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,277
They knew where the line was.

58
00:04:22,821 --> 00:04:25,891
But they've degenerated into
little more than a band of outlaws.

59
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:29,682
I know you claim that these
people had some sense of pride...

60
00:04:29,707 --> 00:04:32,582
But they sound like a bitter mob,
sulking at the rest of the world.

61
00:04:32,926 --> 00:04:34,861
Maybe... but still...

62
00:04:35,231 --> 00:04:37,439
Despite all the indignation they felt...

63
00:04:37,646 --> 00:04:38,540
and the anger...

64
00:04:38,799 --> 00:04:41,536
They maintained a sort of admiration for Espers.

65
00:04:41,974 --> 00:04:44,229
It sounds like you really know a lot about them.

66
00:04:45,015 --> 00:04:46,438
Yeah... I guess so.

67
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:48,050
You've done your research!

68
00:04:50,558 --> 00:04:52,296
Somebody attacked Kongo?

69
00:04:53,365 --> 00:04:56,282
Calm down now... You should just take it easy, Sissy.

70
00:04:56,307 --> 00:04:57,903
Those guys are disgusting!

71
00:04:57,928 --> 00:05:00,556
Ganging up and attacking a girl like that! Come on!

72
00:05:00,599 --> 00:05:03,822
You, uh... seem pretty worked up about this, Misaka.

73
00:05:04,474 --> 00:05:09,185
I just don't have any patience for people who would
rather hurt others instead of facing their own reality.

74
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:11,710
If you want my opinion, it's both futile and cruel.

75
00:05:13,342 --> 00:05:15,977
It's beginning to sound like you're talking about me now.

76
00:05:16,057 --> 00:05:18,052
What? You're nothing like that, Saten.

77
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:19,751
Yes, she's right...

78
00:05:19,858 --> 00:05:20,840
You're not like them...

79
00:05:20,878 --> 00:05:23,173
Skill Out only act when they can do so as a gang.

80
00:05:23,405 --> 00:05:25,489
It takes a lot more guts to act on your own,

81
00:05:25,514 --> 00:05:27,623
like you did when you were so desperate to level up.

82
00:05:27,648 --> 00:05:29,561
Shirai... I know you mean well,

83
00:05:29,586 --> 00:05:31,065
but I don't think you're helping here.

84
00:05:31,614 --> 00:05:35,267
I thought that Skill Out was made up
of a bunch of Level Zero runaways...

85
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:38,073
Why would they be going after Espers like this?

86
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,321
It's a numbers game...

87
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:44,164
No matter how brilliant an Esper is, it'll still
be difficult for him or her to face a large group.

88
00:05:45,957 --> 00:05:49,691
What's worse... We've received
information that this Big Spider organization

89
00:05:49,731 --> 00:05:53,364
has gotten its hands on illegal
weapons using black market channels.

90
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:58,330
I think maybe these guys would feel
differently after tangling with me.

91
00:05:58,355 --> 00:05:59,588
Now, now, Sissy.

92
00:06:00,214 --> 00:06:03,900
You know if you want somebody to tangle with,
you don't have to look any further than right here.

93
00:06:03,925 --> 00:06:05,268
That's not what I meant!

94
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:07,182
You are a seriously disturbed person, do you know that?

95
00:06:07,207 --> 00:06:08,914
So... How'd it all go down?

96
00:06:08,939 --> 00:06:11,657
Those Skill Out people who
attacked Kongo were caught, right?

97
00:06:11,682 --> 00:06:12,911
But who was responsible?

98
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,018
Apparently some mystery man
showed up and took them all out.

99
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:18,657
Wow! A mysterious champion of justice!

100
00:06:18,775 --> 00:06:19,997
Champion? Please!

101
00:06:20,207 --> 00:06:24,431
Members of Judgment and Antiskill are the only
people who should be involved in fighting crime.

102
00:06:24,456 --> 00:06:26,623
This person is nothing more than a vigilante!

103
00:06:35,085 --> 00:06:35,934
It's not you.

104
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,072
It can't be you, right?

105
00:06:40,265 --> 00:06:40,972
Kurozuma...

106
00:06:41,288 --> 00:06:41,836
Yeah?

107
00:06:42,177 --> 00:06:43,117
Here's the thing...

108
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:45,270
The guy who took out Tamezo...

109
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:51,157
You think you can lie to me?

110
00:06:52,387 --> 00:06:53,715
I know what I heard.

111
00:06:58,474 --> 00:07:00,913
No way... we all know he's dead...

112
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:03,360
He didn't suddenly come back to life.

113
00:07:04,849 --> 00:07:05,815
Hey, listen up!

114
00:07:06,831 --> 00:07:08,183
Tell me what my name is!

115
00:07:08,444 --> 00:07:09,994
Wataru Kurozuma!

116
00:07:10,019 --> 00:07:10,653
That's right.

117
00:07:10,965 --> 00:07:12,173
I am Kurozuma...

118
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:14,180
The rightful head of Big Spider.

119
00:07:14,664 --> 00:07:16,287
You haven't forgotten, have you?

120
00:07:17,349 --> 00:07:19,361
You know that look as well as I do...

121
00:07:19,783 --> 00:07:21,665
The taunting look of the Espers.

122
00:07:22,441 --> 00:07:24,693
We're all here to take 'em down a notch or two.

123
00:07:25,184 --> 00:07:26,783
We're gonna show 'em who we are.

124
00:07:26,808 --> 00:07:28,724
They'll know Skill Out means business!

125
00:07:28,862 --> 00:07:29,808
Yeah!

126
00:07:31,886 --> 00:07:33,232
It's Big Spider again?

127
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:36,156
Yes... this is the third time this week.

128
00:07:36,437 --> 00:07:38,931
They seem to be kicking their campaign into high gear.

129
00:07:39,001 --> 00:07:40,878
We'll have to take the wind out of their sails, then.

130
00:07:41,171 --> 00:07:42,394
Not "we," Sissy...

131
00:07:42,836 --> 00:07:46,700
You know full well that I don't approve of
you getting involved in our cases like this.

132
00:07:46,756 --> 00:07:51,650
From what I can tell, it was about two years ago
that Big Spider began expanding their organization.

133
00:07:52,391 --> 00:07:57,140
Around that time, they started carrying weapons
and got involved in a lot of criminal activities.

134
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:58,411
That makes sense...

135
00:07:58,825 --> 00:08:01,350
They were armed, so they must've
thought they could do anything.

136
00:08:01,922 --> 00:08:03,265
But the question remains:

137
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:06,260
how were they able to smuggle
those weapons into Academy City?

138
00:08:06,726 --> 00:08:09,147
The distribution of goods is strictly monitored...

139
00:08:09,263 --> 00:08:13,039
So, in theory, illegal items should
be easy enough to spot, shouldn't they?

140
00:08:14,063 --> 00:08:16,400
People who deal in such things must have their ways.

141
00:08:16,711 --> 00:08:18,345
They probably aren't working alone.

142
00:08:18,432 --> 00:08:20,673
It's likely they have others setting up routes.

143
00:08:21,003 --> 00:08:22,239
You think they have backing?

144
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:24,366
Interesting...

145
00:08:24,822 --> 00:08:27,047
At any rate, it's an idea worth looking into.

146
00:08:27,172 --> 00:08:27,698
Um...

147
00:08:28,314 --> 00:08:29,938
I've found something else...

148
00:08:29,997 --> 00:08:32,654
It's the name of the person who leads Big Spider.

149
00:08:32,878 --> 00:08:34,267
Wataru Kurozuma...

150
00:08:34,602 --> 00:08:36,785
By all accounts, he's a very vicious man.

151
00:08:37,564 --> 00:08:40,949
He doesn't seem to have any qualms
about betraying his followers...

152
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:46,056
Reports say that if somebody leaves the group, he
won't hesitate to shoot the so-called traitor in the back.

153
00:08:47,178 --> 00:08:50,219
So, basically this is one of
the biggest jerks we've dealt with.

154
00:08:50,673 --> 00:08:52,595
Oh... speaking of backs...

155
00:08:52,662 --> 00:08:55,741
apparently this guy has a tattoo of a spider on his.

156
00:08:56,891 --> 00:08:57,751
A spider?

157
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,327
Really? Didn't the man who
rescued Kongo have a spider tattoo?

158
00:09:01,725 --> 00:09:04,024
So he's the infamous Wataru Kurozuma?

159
00:09:04,181 --> 00:09:05,738
But that doesn't make any sense.

160
00:09:05,876 --> 00:09:09,408
Maybe he wasn't trying to rescue
her, but fighting a faction of the gang.

161
00:09:09,641 --> 00:09:12,332
According to Uiharu, loyalty's not his strong suit.

162
00:09:12,641 --> 00:09:13,538
You might be right.

163
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,573
It's at least something we should consider.

164
00:09:16,053 --> 00:09:22,023
According to my information, Kurozuma's base of operations
is in an area of School District Ten known as "Strange."

165
00:09:23,474 --> 00:09:24,208
Are we going?

166
00:09:24,305 --> 00:09:26,425
Technically, it's outside of our jurisdiction...

167
00:09:26,568 --> 00:09:30,657
but since the incident we're investigating happened
in District Seven, I think we can make it stick.

168
00:09:31,031 --> 00:09:32,197
Are you coming, Konori?

169
00:09:32,222 --> 00:09:33,887
Sorry... I wish I could go.

170
00:09:34,088 --> 00:09:36,485
But I absolutely have to get these reports done today.

171
00:09:36,818 --> 00:09:37,239
Huh?

172
00:09:38,074 --> 00:09:39,527
Well... let's get going.

173
00:09:39,724 --> 00:09:41,315
You know you shouldn't get involved!

174
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:43,300
I'm pinch-hitting for Konori. Now, come on.

175
00:09:43,325 --> 00:09:45,176
Hold on, Sissy. Did you hear what I said?

176
00:09:45,398 --> 00:09:46,282
Oh, all right...

177
00:09:46,407 --> 00:09:47,822
I can never say no to you!

178
00:09:49,057 --> 00:09:50,037
And off they go.

179
00:09:51,182 --> 00:09:52,307
Always eager.

180
00:09:57,338 --> 00:09:58,141
Here we are.

181
00:09:58,282 --> 00:09:59,928
The headquarters for Big Spider...

182
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:01,612
otherwise known as Strange.

183
00:10:03,949 --> 00:10:04,590
Wow.

184
00:10:05,382 --> 00:10:06,307
"Strange," huh?

185
00:10:06,807 --> 00:10:08,692
Not a bad word to describe this place.

186
00:10:09,182 --> 00:10:12,935
It's not like I expected them to have
their headquarters in a mansion or anything.

187
00:10:13,452 --> 00:10:14,548
But this is pretty bad.

188
00:10:14,764 --> 00:10:18,382
Well, I guess I can see how this
would be a fitting place for a gang

189
00:10:18,407 --> 00:10:20,695
who commits the kind of crimes that Skill Out does.

190
00:10:26,235 --> 00:10:28,864
Although... as vile as Skill Out is...

191
00:10:29,281 --> 00:10:34,734
Maybe Academy City should share some of the blame for
neglecting this area and letting it become so dilapidated.

192
00:10:34,827 --> 00:10:39,016
I don't know about you, but this definitely
isn't one of the warmer welcomes I've ever received.

193
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:41,107
It would help if you didn't have that armband on.

194
00:10:41,132 --> 00:10:42,925
Wha... You were rushing so much,

195
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:44,005
I forgot to take it off!

196
00:10:44,066 --> 00:10:45,890
I'd planned on wearing a disguise, b...

197
00:10:46,614 --> 00:10:48,697
Hey, ladies. What brings you to our part of town?

198
00:10:48,824 --> 00:10:49,657
Take a look at this.

199
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:51,181
These two are with Judgment.

200
00:10:51,365 --> 00:10:52,461
So, like I was saying...

201
00:10:52,866 --> 00:10:53,977
I get it, Sissy.

202
00:10:54,073 --> 00:10:56,051
It looks like they're having a little squabble.

203
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:57,864
It's too late to run back home.

204
00:10:57,995 --> 00:10:58,696
Hey now.

205
00:11:01,641 --> 00:11:03,516
Picking on young girls, are we?

206
00:11:09,976 --> 00:11:11,464
I'm afraid we can't have that.

207
00:11:12,391 --> 00:11:13,115
What the heck?

208
00:11:14,182 --> 00:11:15,355
Is that milk?

209
00:11:17,615 --> 00:11:20,099
Yeah? Who do you think you are?

210
00:11:21,173 --> 00:11:22,619
Hold on a second, okay?

211
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:23,984
Huh? What the...?

212
00:11:24,705 --> 00:11:27,907
I get it. He's trying to show off in
front of these girls by playing hero.

213
00:11:28,029 --> 00:11:28,951
Am I, now?

214
00:11:29,596 --> 00:11:32,017
How 'bout you walk away and mind your own business.

215
00:11:35,265 --> 00:11:36,976
Uh... here you go, sir...

216
00:11:37,102 --> 00:11:40,034
Um... Will this carton be an acceptable replacement?

217
00:11:40,131 --> 00:11:42,282
Yeah... thanks for taking the trouble.

218
00:11:42,307 --> 00:11:44,564
Oh, of course... Well, we have to be going!

219
00:11:45,095 --> 00:11:46,000
Sounds good...

220
00:11:46,169 --> 00:11:47,088
You take care.

221
00:11:51,437 --> 00:11:54,271
Good stuff. When it comes to milk, it's gotta be Musasino.

222
00:11:54,378 --> 00:11:55,378
You know, it's funny...

223
00:11:55,403 --> 00:11:57,069
I don't remember asking for your help.

224
00:11:58,269 --> 00:11:59,309
Sorry about that.

225
00:11:59,827 --> 00:12:03,917
It's just you reminded me of a girl I once knew
whose chest was no bigger than either of yours.

226
00:12:04,164 --> 00:12:05,307
I couldn't walk away.

227
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:09,621
A man we've never met just
made a comment about our breasts.

228
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:11,599
And surprisingly, it didn't sound offensive.

229
00:12:12,395 --> 00:12:14,292
Hey hold on a sec. We're not done!

230
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:15,246
Wait up, Sissy!

231
00:12:23,991 --> 00:12:26,018
Mii? You're home already?

232
00:12:27,085 --> 00:12:29,585
It's not like you to be home so early in the day...

233
00:12:29,717 --> 00:12:31,223
What about your work for Judgment?

234
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,200
Don't worry. I'm gonna take care of it...

235
00:12:33,487 --> 00:12:34,312
What about you?

236
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:36,243
You could stop by the branch once in a while.

237
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:38,328
Being on campus is enough for me.

238
00:12:38,653 --> 00:12:40,996
I have matters of love and youth to attend to.

239
00:12:41,304 --> 00:12:43,650
Honestly... You're always like this, aren't you?

240
00:12:43,932 --> 00:12:45,665
Hey... Is something wrong?

241
00:12:49,682 --> 00:12:50,325
Not really.

242
00:12:53,809 --> 00:12:54,303
'Kay.

243
00:12:54,947 --> 00:12:57,107
Well... since you're home early for once,

244
00:12:57,296 --> 00:12:59,171
maybe you can take a turn cooking dinner.

245
00:12:59,391 --> 00:13:01,349
Huh? That's not fair, Aomi!

246
00:13:05,115 --> 00:13:05,926
Wow...

247
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:07,961
Nice, isn't it?

248
00:13:08,615 --> 00:13:10,018
It's kind of a secret spot.

249
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:13,037
The streets below can start to feel suffocating.

250
00:13:14,261 --> 00:13:16,325
But the breeze up here takes you away from all that.

251
00:13:17,882 --> 00:13:21,675
The view of Strange from this rooftop
isn't any different than it was two years ago.

252
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,056
Two years ago?

253
00:13:23,266 --> 00:13:24,900
Well... a lot can happen.

254
00:13:25,366 --> 00:13:26,400
I have to wonder...

255
00:13:27,067 --> 00:13:30,682
Why do the members of Skill Out
choose to be in this area of all places?

256
00:13:30,835 --> 00:13:32,764
It's not something you two would understand.

257
00:13:34,552 --> 00:13:36,379
It's not like I don't understand.

258
00:13:36,423 --> 00:13:37,363
Understand what?

259
00:13:37,959 --> 00:13:39,918
The way the members of Skill Out feel.

260
00:13:41,225 --> 00:13:44,516
You keep trying and trying, but
your level never goes any higher.

261
00:13:44,674 --> 00:13:46,390
And eventually, you start to lose hope.

262
00:13:48,042 --> 00:13:48,804
I don't know...

263
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:52,174
It's like, after a while, you
feel like giving up on everything.

264
00:13:53,726 --> 00:13:55,575
We really have given up on everything...

265
00:13:55,899 --> 00:13:57,116
The system's broken.

266
00:13:57,913 --> 00:14:01,748
So we left Academy City behind, where
everybody's judged by their ability.

267
00:14:04,099 --> 00:14:04,958
What about you?

268
00:14:05,539 --> 00:14:07,547
Huh...? Me...? No, no...

269
00:14:07,665 --> 00:14:10,169
I decided that giving up on everything doesn't help.

270
00:14:11,538 --> 00:14:14,387
Yeah... from now on, I'm gonna keep on trying.

271
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:19,178
For us trying to use our Esper
abilities is like trying to touch the sky.

272
00:14:19,891 --> 00:14:23,897
And the sky is especially far away
from the alleys of this city... So...

273
00:14:24,546 --> 00:14:27,323
Whatever the reason, Skill Out
is still Skill Out, isn't it?

274
00:14:27,636 --> 00:14:30,651
Individuals may be different,
but the group is up to no good.

275
00:14:32,293 --> 00:14:33,464
That's pretty harsh.

276
00:14:34,096 --> 00:14:36,471
So what did the two of you come down here for?

277
00:14:36,496 --> 00:14:37,683
Oh, I almost forgot.

278
00:14:37,853 --> 00:14:40,335
We're looking for an organization called Big Spider.

279
00:14:41,574 --> 00:14:45,016
If I were you... I'd be careful
dropping that name around here too much.

280
00:14:46,769 --> 00:14:50,029
By any chance do you recognize the name Wataru Kurozuma?

281
00:14:50,077 --> 00:14:51,467
Nope. I'm afraid I don't.

282
00:14:51,827 --> 00:14:53,722
Well... have a safe trip home.

283
00:14:57,528 --> 00:14:58,599
What is it, Sissy?

284
00:14:58,682 --> 00:14:59,785
Is something the matter?

285
00:15:00,143 --> 00:15:03,050
I don't know... Something about him just bothers me.

286
00:15:03,182 --> 00:15:04,481
Oh...! No...!

287
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:07,699
I don't know if I can handle you
getting all hot and bothered by this guy.

288
00:15:07,777 --> 00:15:08,929
It's too much...! Too much!

289
00:15:09,724 --> 00:15:10,431
Ow...

290
00:15:11,089 --> 00:15:14,410
Did you hear him? He said he'd come
back here after being away for two years.

291
00:15:14,444 --> 00:15:16,716
Yeah, I guess so. But what does that matter?

292
00:15:17,046 --> 00:15:20,832
It was also two years ago that Big
Spider began expanding its operation.

293
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:23,082
Doesn't that raise any flags for you?

294
00:15:23,107 --> 00:15:25,203
Now that you mention it, that is kinda weird.

295
00:15:25,273 --> 00:15:27,074
Let's go and check out some other places...

296
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,475
Maybe we'll learn something.

297
00:15:28,684 --> 00:15:31,469
Uh... Sure, Sissy, but at least wait for me!

298
00:15:32,921 --> 00:15:34,512
What are you idiots doing?

299
00:15:34,813 --> 00:15:38,287
Over a dozen guys from our esper
hunting parties have been taken down.

300
00:15:39,633 --> 00:15:41,383
How is it we still have no leads?

301
00:15:41,574 --> 00:15:43,627
W... we are looking, I swear!

302
00:15:43,741 --> 00:15:45,200
Oh, you're looking, are you?

303
00:15:45,438 --> 00:15:47,147
Well looking isn't gonna be enough...

304
00:15:47,408 --> 00:15:48,718
You need to find something!

305
00:15:49,182 --> 00:15:51,223
Do you know why you can't find anything?

306
00:15:51,442 --> 00:15:53,470
It's because they think they're better than we are.

307
00:15:54,324 --> 00:15:55,487
Listen up everybody...

308
00:15:55,657 --> 00:15:57,061
We need to show 'em they're wrong!

309
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:01,452
We need to hunt down those Espers until
they realize how much power Big Spider has.

310
00:16:01,479 --> 00:16:03,448
They'll see that they're too weak to fight us.

311
00:16:03,516 --> 00:16:07,373
Once we do that there won't be anybody
standing in the way of us and what we want!

312
00:16:07,788 --> 00:16:08,669
Yeah!

313
00:16:13,788 --> 00:16:15,834
After all this time, he's still alive?

314
00:16:16,327 --> 00:16:18,535
No... no way can that be true.

315
00:16:19,473 --> 00:16:20,029
But if...

316
00:16:21,074 --> 00:16:23,535
If it is... if he is alive...

317
00:16:28,882 --> 00:16:30,525
Something needs to be done.

318
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:33,154
W... What is this?!

319
00:16:33,591 --> 00:16:35,591
I see... you guys are Skill Out.

320
00:16:35,682 --> 00:16:37,207
You're messin' with the wrong guy...

321
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,255
I happen to be...

322
00:16:48,075 --> 00:16:48,688
See that...?

323
00:16:49,196 --> 00:16:51,706
Now, unless the rest of you guys wanna end up like him...

324
00:16:55,824 --> 00:16:57,680
Think we're scared of someone like you?

325
00:16:58,783 --> 00:17:01,430
What happened to all that brave talk of yours? Huh?

326
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,718
Go ahead and use your ability on us...

327
00:17:03,905 --> 00:17:08,399
Assuming you can concentrate enough to calculate
while you're gettin' the pulp beaten out of you.

328
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:11,791
Survival of the fittest is the rule here in Academy City.

329
00:17:12,019 --> 00:17:14,282
Right now we're the predators and you're the prey.

330
00:17:14,307 --> 00:17:14,786
You know...

331
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:18,814
It's pretty amazing how quickly
the hunters can become the hunted.

332
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:20,951
Time for you to face Judgment!

333
00:17:22,114 --> 00:17:23,489
Why don't you keep moving?

334
00:17:23,557 --> 00:17:25,474
Yeah, little girls, run along and play now.

335
00:17:30,191 --> 00:17:32,051
Why'd you have to go and make it difficult?

336
00:17:32,982 --> 00:17:35,720
I left the victim at the nearby branch to make his report.

337
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,381
These guys are finished.

338
00:17:38,092 --> 00:17:41,212
Man... we searched all over
Strange and didn't find anything.

339
00:17:42,107 --> 00:17:45,327
Then we come upon these guys while
just walking down the street like normal.

340
00:17:45,352 --> 00:17:47,393
So? All's well that ends well, right?

341
00:17:47,593 --> 00:17:49,282
Yeah... I guess that's true...

342
00:17:49,886 --> 00:17:50,719
Where to now?

343
00:17:54,067 --> 00:17:55,484
What's goin' on here?

344
00:17:57,856 --> 00:17:59,213
We represent Judgment!

345
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,602
What do they want?

346
00:18:01,141 --> 00:18:03,010
You kids shouldn't be messing around here.

347
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:05,838
Oh? Judgment's paying a visit?

348
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:08,008
What the hell do you want with us?

349
00:18:08,271 --> 00:18:09,939
Wataru Kurozuma, right?

350
00:18:10,933 --> 00:18:15,309
You are under arrest for your involvement in
leading the recent acts of violence against Espers.

351
00:18:17,366 --> 00:18:18,727
You're here to arrest me?

352
00:18:19,302 --> 00:18:22,500
Sorry, but I don't have time to play
house with you and your little sidekick.

353
00:18:22,915 --> 00:18:23,931
Now get lost.

354
00:18:23,956 --> 00:18:25,410
You aren't very polite, are you?

355
00:18:25,697 --> 00:18:30,906
I'm trying to explain things to you nicely... but if
you don't get it, we can make you understand the hard way.

356
00:18:32,115 --> 00:18:33,250
Stand back, Sissy...

357
00:18:33,505 --> 00:18:37,157
I can handle the likes of these wretched
pests all on my own without any problems.

358
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:38,615
Don't get ahead of yourself.

359
00:18:38,872 --> 00:18:41,592
'Cause ya see... we have a secret weapon.

360
00:18:43,865 --> 00:18:45,358
What is that horrible sound?

361
00:18:45,612 --> 00:18:48,598
It feels like it's reverberating directly inside my head.

362
00:18:49,093 --> 00:18:50,204
Is something wrong?

363
00:18:52,437 --> 00:18:53,383
I can't do it!

364
00:18:53,824 --> 00:18:55,170
Well, why aren't you fighting?

365
00:18:55,542 --> 00:18:57,928
I thought you were gonna take us all out by yourself!

366
00:18:58,569 --> 00:18:59,405
Kuroko!

367
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:06,745
What happened...? I can't aim or use my full power.

368
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:08,533
Heh... technical difficulties?

369
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,203
Let me tell you about our handy new weapon...

370
00:19:11,506 --> 00:19:14,467
That device over there is called a Capacity Down system.

371
00:19:14,734 --> 00:19:17,279
I don't know much about it, but I'll explain what I can.

372
00:19:17,505 --> 00:19:20,673
Essentially, it jumbles up the
arithmetic capacity of the brain.

373
00:19:21,138 --> 00:19:23,657
But... it doesn't work on members of Skill Out...

374
00:19:23,682 --> 00:19:25,224
All we hear is a high-pitched sound.

375
00:19:25,365 --> 00:19:26,973
Annoying, but harmless to us.

376
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:28,498
Capacity Down...?

377
00:19:28,617 --> 00:19:30,278
Where on earth did they get that thing?

378
00:19:30,941 --> 00:19:34,799
Now... I would like to hear you
say, "Please forgive us, Mr. Kurozuma."

379
00:19:35,067 --> 00:19:37,485
If you do that, I might consider letting you go.

380
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:37,978
Oh?

381
00:19:38,795 --> 00:19:40,670
Did you say your name is Kurozuma?

382
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:44,474
Ah! It's him!

383
00:19:44,557 --> 00:19:46,182
Yeah! That's the guy, all right.

384
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:48,202
Kurozuma! It's the man from before!

385
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,172
He's the one who's been interfering with us.

386
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:53,454
Kurozuma... it's you.

387
00:19:54,731 --> 00:19:55,557
I'm confused.

388
00:19:55,608 --> 00:19:56,465
What's going on?

389
00:19:56,905 --> 00:19:57,936
Kurozuma, what's the matter?

390
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:58,405
Let's see...

391
00:19:58,487 --> 00:19:59,476
Kurozuma!

392
00:19:59,849 --> 00:20:00,724
There we go!

393
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:02,891
The noise!

394
00:20:03,129 --> 00:20:04,108
It's gone now!

395
00:20:04,694 --> 00:20:05,513
Are you okay?

396
00:20:06,349 --> 00:20:06,871
And you?

397
00:20:07,457 --> 00:20:09,048
Uh... yeah.

398
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:10,118
Hey, y...

399
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:11,383
Hold this for me, will you?

400
00:20:13,593 --> 00:20:14,555
Hey, Hebitani...

401
00:20:15,238 --> 00:20:16,516
long time no see, huh?

402
00:20:16,741 --> 00:20:18,058
No... impossible...

403
00:20:18,394 --> 00:20:19,870
You've been dead for two years...

404
00:20:20,234 --> 00:20:21,745
There's no way you could've survived.

405
00:20:21,907 --> 00:20:22,905
Not after what happened.

406
00:20:23,628 --> 00:20:24,922
Fine then, have it your way.

407
00:20:24,947 --> 00:20:25,693
I'm a ghost.

408
00:20:26,235 --> 00:20:27,069
A ghost?

409
00:20:28,157 --> 00:20:29,706
That's right... a ghost...

410
00:20:30,253 --> 00:20:32,803
Time for you to go back to your grave!

411
00:20:32,867 --> 00:20:34,448
Go on... let him have it!

412
00:20:34,972 --> 00:20:36,538
He's just one guy, isn't he...?

413
00:20:36,863 --> 00:20:38,374
And besides, we're all armed.

414
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,439
It's such a shame...

415
00:20:40,686 --> 00:20:42,067
You've changed, Hebitani.

416
00:20:47,197 --> 00:20:47,758
Die!

417
00:20:49,352 --> 00:20:50,274
Put that away...

418
00:20:50,507 --> 00:20:53,636
With your aim, you'll probably just
end up shooting yourself in the foot.

419
00:21:09,107 --> 00:21:10,520
Hey, wait for us!

420
00:21:17,661 --> 00:21:18,463
All done.

421
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,482
Starting to feel a little better now?

422
00:21:20,832 --> 00:21:23,309
More or less. Still not back up to full power yet...

423
00:21:23,555 --> 00:21:24,365
I'll be fine...

424
00:21:24,879 --> 00:21:25,970
So, that guy...

425
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,432
He wasn't Kurozuma?

426
00:21:27,574 --> 00:21:30,237
A long time ago, back when I knew him he was Hebitani.

427
00:21:30,762 --> 00:21:33,210
Apparently he prefers to go by Kurozuma now.

428
00:21:33,368 --> 00:21:36,396
But... the real Kurozuma is actually you, right?

429
00:21:36,766 --> 00:21:39,099
Yeah, I suppose I've been called that before.

430
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:43,165
When it comes to milk...

431
00:21:43,189 --> 00:21:44,483
It's gotta be Musasino.

432
00:21:47,266 --> 00:21:48,065
Konori?!

433
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:50,927
It's been a long time...

434
00:21:51,531 --> 00:21:52,038
Mii.

435
00:23:30,449 --> 00:23:31,944
Hey, Konori, what's going on?

436
00:23:32,056 --> 00:23:33,787
I don't understand what you're so upset about.

437
00:23:33,932 --> 00:23:36,741
Oh Sissy! Sometimes you can be really naïve...

438
00:23:36,912 --> 00:23:39,174
The next episode might be too mature for you.
