1
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:04,683
It's been a long time Mii.

2
00:00:06,944 --> 00:00:07,738
Kurozuma.

3
00:00:08,915 --> 00:00:09,852
You're really alive.

4
00:00:10,989 --> 00:00:12,132
It looks that way.

5
00:00:13,809 --> 00:00:14,483
But why?

6
00:00:15,038 --> 00:00:17,900
Why didn't you contact me? All
this time, not a word from you!

7
00:00:18,127 --> 00:00:19,807
I thought... you were dead.

8
00:00:26,734 --> 00:00:27,823
Don't worry about me.

9
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:31,263
I can easily disappear again.

10
00:00:32,155 --> 00:00:32,913
Come back!

11
00:00:35,718 --> 00:00:36,560
Please don't go.

12
00:02:10,037 --> 00:02:12,341
So Konori and Kurozuma know each other?

13
00:02:12,462 --> 00:02:13,320
Mm... hmm.

14
00:02:13,616 --> 00:02:16,282
She hasn't explained exactly
how they're acquainted, though.

15
00:02:16,923 --> 00:02:19,110
But I thought Kurozuma was part of that gang.

16
00:02:19,425 --> 00:02:21,843
He's supposedly the boss of Big Spider.

17
00:02:22,606 --> 00:02:23,877
According to our information.

18
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:25,282
It makes no sense.

19
00:02:25,313 --> 00:02:26,953
How would she know someone like that?

20
00:02:26,985 --> 00:02:29,822
She wouldn't be friends with a
guy who goes around attacking girls!

21
00:02:29,847 --> 00:02:32,007
Oh... um... that's not him...

22
00:02:32,173 --> 00:02:33,740
This is a different Kurozuma...

23
00:02:34,113 --> 00:02:35,221
How do I explain it?

24
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:36,694
It's like, uh...

25
00:02:39,004 --> 00:02:40,101
You wanna chime in?

26
00:02:40,245 --> 00:02:42,289
I could use some help clarifying this thing.

27
00:02:42,721 --> 00:02:45,255
People connect in mysterious ways sometimes.

28
00:02:45,591 --> 00:02:49,245
When it comes to situations like this, I
find it best to remain a silent observer.

29
00:02:49,976 --> 00:02:51,590
Oh, man, this is bugging me!

30
00:02:51,615 --> 00:02:53,387
Why does it have to be so confusing?!

31
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:56,508
Maybe I'll just go straight to
Konori and ask her about it myself.

32
00:02:56,622 --> 00:02:57,262
Good luck.

33
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:00,771
Nobody's seen her for a few days now.

34
00:03:00,796 --> 00:03:02,418
She hasn't shown up at the branch.

35
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:03,804
Not at all?

36
00:03:03,828 --> 00:03:04,286
Nope...

37
00:03:04,456 --> 00:03:06,748
and I can't get through to her on her cell, either...

38
00:03:06,871 --> 00:03:10,538
It's weird for her to disappear when
we're in the middle of a big case like this.

39
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:13,104
Fretting about her vanishing act won't do us any good...

40
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:15,980
We're not going to find any
answers by sitting here all day.

41
00:03:16,206 --> 00:03:18,033
It's time for us to take this show on the road.

42
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:19,503
What are you talking about?

43
00:03:19,528 --> 00:03:20,604
The road to where?

44
00:03:23,702 --> 00:03:24,489
Coming!

45
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,040
Hello. Who are you?

46
00:03:28,327 --> 00:03:29,034
Oh, um...

47
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:31,221
We were looking for Mii Konori,

48
00:03:31,246 --> 00:03:33,793
but maybe we got the wrong place... Sorry.

49
00:03:33,818 --> 00:03:35,845
Oh, you're junior Judgment officers...

50
00:03:36,098 --> 00:03:37,718
Sorry. I'm afraid you're out of luck.

51
00:03:37,743 --> 00:03:38,927
Mii isn't here right now.

52
00:03:39,014 --> 00:03:40,382
Oh... she isn't?

53
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:44,201
I wanted to hear more about this Kurozuma character.

54
00:03:44,669 --> 00:03:45,973
Yeah... that's a real shame.

55
00:03:46,764 --> 00:03:47,555
All right, then.

56
00:03:47,704 --> 00:03:48,776
We'll try again later...

57
00:03:49,092 --> 00:03:50,201
Sorry to bother you.

58
00:03:51,674 --> 00:03:52,923
Wait... don't go.

59
00:03:54,922 --> 00:03:56,422
What am I gonna do with her?

60
00:03:56,538 --> 00:03:58,566
Making all of you worry along with me.

61
00:03:58,811 --> 00:04:00,129
It's okay. Thanks.

62
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,259
So then...

63
00:04:02,894 --> 00:04:04,674
Kurozuma has returned, has he?

64
00:04:07,764 --> 00:04:09,767
He's still alive after all this time.

65
00:04:10,455 --> 00:04:12,166
Then you know who Kurozuma is?

66
00:04:12,496 --> 00:04:14,638
Can you tell us how he and Konori know each other?

67
00:04:14,663 --> 00:04:16,075
Just slow down a second...

68
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,697
Maybe you could tell me more about yourselves first.

69
00:04:23,604 --> 00:04:24,354
I see.

70
00:04:24,799 --> 00:04:25,904
Then it's no wonder.

71
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:27,967
So... anyway...

72
00:04:28,404 --> 00:04:32,096
It would be great if you'd tell us about
Konori's past involvement with Kurozuma...

73
00:04:32,197 --> 00:04:33,538
We don't know anything really,

74
00:04:33,563 --> 00:04:36,224
but I thought maybe she apprehended him sometime before?

75
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,194
No, you're wrong about that...

76
00:04:38,654 --> 00:04:39,424
Very wrong...

77
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:42,476
You see, Mii was actually part of Big Spider once.

78
00:04:44,628 --> 00:04:46,971
No way! Impossible! I don't believe it.

79
00:04:46,996 --> 00:04:49,316
Neither do I. She's a senior member of Judgment!

80
00:04:49,341 --> 00:04:50,705
You must be mistaken!

81
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:52,052
That's who she is now...

82
00:04:52,165 --> 00:04:54,212
But she used to have a little bit of a wild streak.

83
00:04:54,466 --> 00:04:55,839
She had a wild streak??

84
00:04:56,343 --> 00:05:00,011
I hate to speak out of turn about
somebody's past, but it makes no sense to me.

85
00:05:00,098 --> 00:05:03,675
Wild child or not, the fact remains
that Konori is a Level 3 Esper...

86
00:05:03,851 --> 00:05:06,580
She could've become involved
in any number of organizations.

87
00:05:06,663 --> 00:05:11,442
With so many options open why in the world would she
choose to run with a group of non-espers like Skill-Out?

88
00:05:12,123 --> 00:05:13,498
It's not as simple as that...

89
00:05:13,739 --> 00:05:15,938
Have you ever hit a wall when it came to your ability?

90
00:05:16,146 --> 00:05:20,743
She had a difficult time trying to get past
hers, and the depression became too much to handle.

91
00:05:22,557 --> 00:05:24,399
Back then things were hard for her.

92
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:27,656
She felt like no matter where she went, she didn't belong.

93
00:05:29,389 --> 00:05:30,946
One day that changed.

94
00:05:58,238 --> 00:06:00,875
She found a group of people who made her feel less alone.

95
00:06:02,108 --> 00:06:03,838
Skill-Out was a gang, true...

96
00:06:04,096 --> 00:06:07,984
but they did nothing more harmful than
hang out together and goof around a little bit.

97
00:06:08,351 --> 00:06:09,136
Honestly...

98
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:11,020
I was worried at first, too.

99
00:06:11,459 --> 00:06:14,690
She was intentionally hiding the
fact that she was an Esper from them...

100
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,510
It didn't seem right somehow.

101
00:06:17,386 --> 00:06:17,756
But...

102
00:06:22,065 --> 00:06:25,861
"Big Spider is the first place I've
found where I've felt free to be myself."

103
00:06:28,032 --> 00:06:28,944
So she said...

104
00:06:29,297 --> 00:06:30,405
and I believed her.

105
00:06:31,733 --> 00:06:32,630
Being yourself.

106
00:06:35,363 --> 00:06:36,347
Alienation...

107
00:06:36,846 --> 00:06:37,961
self-discovery...

108
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:42,323
Everyone who lives in Academy City is
sure to experience those at some point.

109
00:06:42,859 --> 00:06:45,042
It's a fact of life here, like chicken pox.

110
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:47,821
The problem with that is you only catch chicken pox once.

111
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,093
What's wrong, Sissy?

112
00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:07,695
Yo.

113
00:07:07,867 --> 00:07:09,280
Oh. Hey...

114
00:07:09,928 --> 00:07:10,987
I was just...

115
00:07:12,613 --> 00:07:15,661
So, Mii... word on the street is you're a Level Two.

116
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,455
If that's true, you shouldn't be here.

117
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,347
Let me stay!

118
00:07:19,452 --> 00:07:20,904
I don't have anywhere else to go...

119
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:23,166
Please don't make me!

120
00:07:27,268 --> 00:07:29,531
I guess Espers have problems of their own, huh?

121
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:33,100
Well... okay then.

122
00:07:35,084 --> 00:07:35,801
However...

123
00:07:36,663 --> 00:07:38,295
What're you going to do next year?

124
00:07:38,492 --> 00:07:39,533
And the year after that?

125
00:07:41,081 --> 00:07:43,243
Just something you might want to be thinking about.

126
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:56,338
What now?

127
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:03,497
I don't get it.

128
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:05,930
What don't you get?

129
00:08:06,094 --> 00:08:09,247
It's bad enough already that Konori
used to be a member of Skill-Out.

130
00:08:09,548 --> 00:08:11,895
But now she's missing all of this Judgment work, too.

131
00:08:12,389 --> 00:08:13,930
The two things seem related.

132
00:08:14,176 --> 00:08:15,319
I'm sure Konori is...

133
00:08:15,344 --> 00:08:16,559
She's past all that...

134
00:08:16,664 --> 00:08:19,950
Whatever happened before, Konori's a
hard-working member of Judgment now.

135
00:08:20,057 --> 00:08:21,748
She's strict sometimes, that's true...

136
00:08:21,886 --> 00:08:24,465
but she's still nice to us... and she's dependable.

137
00:08:24,684 --> 00:08:26,069
That's the Konori we know.

138
00:08:26,581 --> 00:08:28,801
So why is she behaving like this now?

139
00:08:29,746 --> 00:08:33,138
I have a feeling it's not as cut
and dried as you make it sound, Misaka.

140
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:37,237
Just like everybody, who Konori
is, is a result of who she was.

141
00:08:37,702 --> 00:08:41,101
Besides, it sounds like that part of
her past has special meaning to her...

142
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,569
and is hard to let go.

143
00:08:44,429 --> 00:08:46,056
No! It's not like that, I swear!

144
00:08:46,211 --> 00:08:48,301
I'm not trying to side against you, Misaka!

145
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:51,753
Anyway.

146
00:08:52,983 --> 00:08:54,112
I just don't get it.

147
00:08:58,324 --> 00:08:58,998
What gives?

148
00:08:59,588 --> 00:09:00,548
Where is everybody?

149
00:09:00,918 --> 00:09:02,574
What do you expect after what happened?

150
00:09:02,621 --> 00:09:04,246
Not many guys wanted to hang around.

151
00:09:04,529 --> 00:09:05,553
Yeah, I guess so.

152
00:09:06,117 --> 00:09:09,278
Hey... does this mean the Kurozuma we know is an imposter?

153
00:09:10,209 --> 00:09:11,465
There's no way he is!

154
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:13,515
Kurozuma is still the same guy we knew!

155
00:09:14,015 --> 00:09:17,654
Yeah... but if that's true, why'd he look
so spooked when the guy called him Hebitani?

156
00:09:18,013 --> 00:09:19,371
You saw that too, huh?

157
00:09:19,521 --> 00:09:20,466
Hard to miss...

158
00:09:20,718 --> 00:09:22,009
He almost looked scared.

159
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:24,096
What was that?

160
00:09:24,347 --> 00:09:25,806
Who almost looked scared?

161
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:27,338
Oh... hey, Kurozuma.

162
00:09:27,705 --> 00:09:30,621
You've got time on your hands
to stand around here doubting me?

163
00:09:30,733 --> 00:09:33,591
Then you have time to get out
there, find that poser, and kill 'im!

164
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:37,992
There isn't enough room in Academy
City for two Wataru Kurozumas. Just me!

165
00:09:38,201 --> 00:09:38,858
R... Right!

166
00:09:38,882 --> 00:09:40,074
Okay, let's move!

167
00:09:40,099 --> 00:09:40,606
Let's go!

168
00:09:40,631 --> 00:09:41,581
Come on, hurry it up!

169
00:09:41,606 --> 00:09:42,423
Faster, idiots!

170
00:09:55,129 --> 00:09:56,163
Yeah, hello?

171
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:57,446
Who else would it be?

172
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:01,043
Huh? The Capacity Down system?

173
00:10:01,426 --> 00:10:03,705
Yeah... we're using the hell out of it, all right.

174
00:10:04,756 --> 00:10:05,628
Oh, shut up!

175
00:10:06,017 --> 00:10:07,705
Things are a big mess here, too.

176
00:10:07,788 --> 00:10:09,792
We don't have time for Esper hunting now!

177
00:10:11,562 --> 00:10:12,816
What did you just say?

178
00:10:15,758 --> 00:10:16,719
She looks sad.

179
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,753
Has Misaka been like that for long?

180
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:20,404
Oh yeah... all day.

181
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:23,580
Hey, guys...

182
00:10:23,605 --> 00:10:25,324
I've got an email from Antiskill.

183
00:10:25,967 --> 00:10:26,817
Let's see here...

184
00:10:26,842 --> 00:10:31,568
"To counteract the Esper hunts by Skill-Out,
Antiskill headquarters will be mobilizing tomorrow.

185
00:10:31,713 --> 00:10:36,708
At ten a.m., units will move into School
District Ten, Area G, commonly known as Strange.

186
00:10:36,871 --> 00:10:38,772
It will be a comprehensive sweep."

187
00:10:49,674 --> 00:10:51,789
Mii... you forgot something.

188
00:11:08,307 --> 00:11:09,807
I knew this is where you would be.

189
00:11:12,877 --> 00:11:13,552
Misaka...

190
00:11:16,238 --> 00:11:18,348
So, Konori, what are you doing up here?

191
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,174
No, don't tell me.

192
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:24,393
You've come to warn Kurozuma about the
comprehensive sweep that's happening tomorrow.

193
00:11:26,254 --> 00:11:29,431
Let's go, Konori. This isn't the
place for you. You have to know that.

194
00:11:30,352 --> 00:11:31,114
Yeah you're right.

195
00:11:31,996 --> 00:11:33,927
This isn't the place for me anymore.

196
00:11:34,451 --> 00:11:35,493
I realize that...

197
00:11:35,764 --> 00:11:38,250
but do you know who helped me
figure it out in the first place?

198
00:11:38,773 --> 00:11:39,869
It was Kurozuma.

199
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,430
It's too dangerous! Please don't go!

200
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:45,964
I understand how you feel...

201
00:11:46,188 --> 00:11:48,140
but I can't very well abandon Hebitani.

202
00:11:48,205 --> 00:11:50,538
Even when it's obvious you're walking into a trap?

203
00:11:53,263 --> 00:11:54,753
About that talk we had earlier.

204
00:11:56,038 --> 00:12:00,083
I have to tell you, I really don't think this is
the rooftop where you should be leaving your name.

205
00:12:00,872 --> 00:12:01,745
Sorry, Mii.

206
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:11,500
He's gone.

207
00:12:16,548 --> 00:12:18,301
By the time I arrived on the scene...

208
00:12:34,183 --> 00:12:35,135
And here I am...

209
00:12:35,896 --> 00:12:37,313
Back up on this roof again.

210
00:12:39,788 --> 00:12:42,301
But... you can still leave.

211
00:12:42,499 --> 00:12:45,505
You have to think this through.
You're a senior Judgment officer now...

212
00:12:45,705 --> 00:12:48,428
That means it isn't right for
you to let criminals get away...

213
00:12:48,819 --> 00:12:49,379
Shouldn't you be...

214
00:12:49,403 --> 00:12:49,851
Yeah...

215
00:12:50,361 --> 00:12:51,829
that would be wrong, wouldn't it?

216
00:12:53,028 --> 00:12:53,623
You came.

217
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:56,499
It's really been two years, huh?

218
00:12:57,618 --> 00:12:58,620
Hard to believe...

219
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:01,029
After it happened I woke up in a hospital...

220
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:03,952
From there, I was sent to a treatment facility...

221
00:13:04,947 --> 00:13:07,788
and I didn't get out of there until about six months ago.

222
00:13:08,283 --> 00:13:09,323
All this time...

223
00:13:09,727 --> 00:13:10,506
I never...

224
00:13:11,288 --> 00:13:12,707
It's still nice up here, huh?

225
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:16,091
I thought I would never get to
see the view from this roof again.

226
00:13:17,577 --> 00:13:20,700
I also thought it would be better
if I didn't see you again, either.

227
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:22,653
I know what you'll say.

228
00:13:22,678 --> 00:13:22,996
What?

229
00:13:23,127 --> 00:13:25,126
That it's stupid for you to go in on your own?

230
00:13:25,269 --> 00:13:26,501
Like you did last time?

231
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:29,876
I'm the one who first created Big Spider.

232
00:13:30,514 --> 00:13:32,323
I should be the one to bring it down...

233
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:34,101
Not Antiskill.

234
00:13:34,805 --> 00:13:35,786
No, don't go!

235
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:37,471
You haven't changed at all!

236
00:13:37,804 --> 00:13:41,349
You're still putting others before yourself,
no matter what the cost might be to you.

237
00:13:41,963 --> 00:13:44,271
I couldn't stop you last time. But now!

238
00:13:44,496 --> 00:13:46,028
You're the same way, aren't you?

239
00:13:47,892 --> 00:13:49,658
That's why you're standing here right now...

240
00:13:51,774 --> 00:13:53,671
Well... you should really get going...

241
00:13:54,263 --> 00:13:54,854
Go on...

242
00:13:55,406 --> 00:13:57,761
She's just standing there, waiting patiently for you.

243
00:13:58,946 --> 00:13:59,645
So long.

244
00:14:00,397 --> 00:14:02,648
Try to cherish the place where you belong now.

245
00:14:03,554 --> 00:14:04,515
I'm coming with you...

246
00:14:05,697 --> 00:14:07,964
I... I can't go through that again.

247
00:14:08,696 --> 00:14:10,649
Enough already Mii. Just let it go...

248
00:14:11,005 --> 00:14:12,946
It's not like it was last time, okay?

249
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:14,271
For either of us.

250
00:14:14,763 --> 00:14:16,631
What used to be has nothing to do with it!

251
00:14:16,702 --> 00:14:19,929
The place where I belong may have
changed, but the way I feel hasn't!

252
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,482
Can I ask you something?

253
00:14:30,257 --> 00:14:30,717
Hmm?

254
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:32,347
Time's gonna pass, right?

255
00:14:32,722 --> 00:14:34,135
And we're bound to change some.

256
00:14:35,078 --> 00:14:37,867
But do you think some feelings
may stay the same, no matter what?

257
00:14:41,502 --> 00:14:46,043
I think if your feelings for somebody are strong
enough, then they don't change, even if you do.

258
00:14:48,231 --> 00:14:49,024
Instead...

259
00:14:49,143 --> 00:14:51,503
Those feelings keep growing with every day you live...

260
00:14:51,721 --> 00:14:54,434
Past and present mingle together to make you who you are.

261
00:14:55,795 --> 00:14:57,128
The past and the present...

262
00:14:57,907 --> 00:14:59,550
It may sound presumptuous

263
00:14:59,843 --> 00:15:01,593
but in the short time we've known each other...

264
00:15:01,695 --> 00:15:05,603
I feel like we've built something that isn't
going to fade away just because we get older.

265
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:06,909
I see.

266
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:09,549
We're friends no matter what...

267
00:15:09,788 --> 00:15:12,571
and we're going to keep building
on that friendship every day.

268
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:17,792
You know what, Kuroko?

269
00:15:19,062 --> 00:15:20,945
I have a small favor to ask of you.

270
00:15:34,408 --> 00:15:36,439
We are preparing to launch a general sweep.

271
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,712
Target is District Ten, Area G, also known as "Strange."

272
00:15:40,063 --> 00:15:40,626
Move out!

273
00:15:51,377 --> 00:15:52,314
You two again?

274
00:15:53,964 --> 00:15:54,877
Why are you here?

275
00:15:56,867 --> 00:15:59,374
What the... Hey! What are you doing?

276
00:15:59,952 --> 00:16:01,647
Now that's what I'm talking about!

277
00:16:03,338 --> 00:16:04,563
You brought my armband.

278
00:16:05,174 --> 00:16:06,120
But how did you...?

279
00:16:10,134 --> 00:16:11,054
You know, Konori...

280
00:16:12,107 --> 00:16:13,652
I think that look suits you.

281
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:32,380
You're certainly busy for this hour of the morning.

282
00:16:33,832 --> 00:16:35,318
I've come to put an end to this.

283
00:16:35,555 --> 00:16:37,574
Him again...! The guy from before!

284
00:16:38,178 --> 00:16:39,370
Why, you little...

285
00:16:39,934 --> 00:16:41,729
I'm sure you know this already,

286
00:16:42,922 --> 00:16:44,676
but I have a talent for fighting.

287
00:16:53,543 --> 00:16:56,101
Yeah... I know how good you are in a fight...

288
00:16:56,935 --> 00:16:57,500
but then...

289
00:16:57,691 --> 00:17:00,090
Espers are pretty good at fighting, too, aren't they?

290
00:17:00,195 --> 00:17:02,180
And they've proven no match for our numbers and weapons.

291
00:17:02,205 --> 00:17:02,719
Hold it!

292
00:17:04,746 --> 00:17:05,309
Mii...?

293
00:17:08,209 --> 00:17:09,457
You're looking good today.

294
00:17:11,972 --> 00:17:13,168
Is that you, Konori?!

295
00:17:13,224 --> 00:17:13,923
Hebitani.

296
00:17:14,639 --> 00:17:18,006
You've become quite the scumbag
since the last time we met, haven't you?

297
00:17:18,248 --> 00:17:21,249
Relying on your minions and
weapons to win your battles for you.

298
00:17:22,482 --> 00:17:23,665
Please! You dumb brat!

299
00:17:24,077 --> 00:17:25,055
You don't know anything!

300
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,303
You turned your back on us and joined up with Judgment.

301
00:17:27,426 --> 00:17:30,361
Go on! Show these two just how much we're capable of!

302
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:35,065
Hello there.

303
00:17:35,525 --> 00:17:38,283
I'll be happy to stick these into
your bodies if that would be quicker.

304
00:17:38,362 --> 00:17:39,664
Esper! Hah...

305
00:17:39,746 --> 00:17:41,213
we've still got our ways of dealing with you...

306
00:17:41,238 --> 00:17:41,929
Oh, yeah?

307
00:17:49,087 --> 00:17:50,043
You mean that thing?

308
00:17:50,821 --> 00:17:53,806
You didn't really think we'd fall
for the same trap twice, did you?

309
00:17:54,562 --> 00:17:56,188
You must be stupider than you look.

310
00:17:58,429 --> 00:17:59,535
Kill the girl!

311
00:18:00,138 --> 00:18:01,696
Y... you can't be serious...

312
00:18:01,881 --> 00:18:04,029
but that's the Railgun of Tokiwadai!

313
00:18:09,498 --> 00:18:10,839
I said kill her!

314
00:18:10,949 --> 00:18:13,501
If you wanna live, you'd better follow my orders!

315
00:18:13,814 --> 00:18:15,607
I want you two to stay out of this.

316
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,927
Please, respect your elders for once, okay?

317
00:18:23,455 --> 00:18:24,599
Go on... do it!

318
00:18:37,363 --> 00:18:38,337
Come on, boys...

319
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:39,244
This is sad.

320
00:18:39,269 --> 00:18:40,802
You've gotta put some heart into it...

321
00:18:40,908 --> 00:18:42,485
or else it won't be a challenge!

322
00:18:50,883 --> 00:18:53,242
I'll be taking that... and this, too.

323
00:18:53,288 --> 00:18:54,972
You don't need a stun gun, do you?

324
00:18:54,997 --> 00:18:55,538
Hey, how...

325
00:18:59,169 --> 00:19:00,877
So that's your ability, is it?

326
00:19:02,329 --> 00:19:03,705
Feels good to use it, huh?

327
00:19:04,968 --> 00:19:05,866
Sure does.

328
00:19:08,256 --> 00:19:10,385
I'm not gonna let you have all the fun, though!

329
00:19:20,955 --> 00:19:22,788
Now then... what'll it be?

330
00:19:25,381 --> 00:19:27,366
You really think you've beaten us, don't you?

331
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,797
You're wrong! Take a look at this!

332
00:19:31,554 --> 00:19:32,568
Dynamite?!

333
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:35,292
Who uses something that old school anymore?

334
00:19:35,317 --> 00:19:37,176
Go on. I dare you to come closer...

335
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:39,457
I'll blow us all sky-high!

336
00:19:43,747 --> 00:19:44,909
Well? What's the matter...?

337
00:19:45,004 --> 00:19:46,131
Are you scared now?

338
00:19:48,564 --> 00:19:49,452
What a pain.

339
00:19:51,073 --> 00:19:52,322
No... stay back!

340
00:19:52,605 --> 00:19:53,629
I'll blow us up.

341
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:55,108
Ah, Hebitani...

342
00:19:55,472 --> 00:19:57,769
We had some good times together, didn't we?

343
00:19:57,885 --> 00:20:00,113
Stand still! Not one step more!

344
00:20:00,138 --> 00:20:02,593
We all used to hang out, just because it was fun.

345
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:04,506
What happened to that?

346
00:20:06,429 --> 00:20:07,137
Stay there.

347
00:20:07,779 --> 00:20:08,264
Stop.

348
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,790
What happened to you?

349
00:20:17,522 --> 00:20:18,588
What changed?

350
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:22,247
I... I had no choice...

351
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:24,289
What else could I have done?

352
00:20:25,771 --> 00:20:27,689
This is the only place where we belong...

353
00:20:28,357 --> 00:20:30,867
I had to find a way to keep Big Spider together...

354
00:20:31,494 --> 00:20:33,994
and that could only happen if I became Kurozuma.

355
00:20:36,175 --> 00:20:37,001
And that's why...

356
00:20:37,349 --> 00:20:40,393
I have no choice but to get rid of you once and for all!

357
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:51,383
Hebitani...

358
00:20:52,912 --> 00:20:54,671
This isn't where you belong.

359
00:20:54,774 --> 00:20:56,895
Your place is wherever you can be yourself.

360
00:20:56,956 --> 00:20:58,235
Haven't you realized that yet?

361
00:21:07,496 --> 00:21:10,107
Well... I'm glad that's over, at least...

362
00:21:10,927 --> 00:21:11,554
Now...

363
00:21:12,977 --> 00:21:13,477
Here.

364
00:21:15,581 --> 00:21:16,272
Mii...

365
00:21:21,064 --> 00:21:22,311
Wataru Kurozuma...

366
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:26,252
On behalf of Judgment, I am placing
you under arrest for suspicion of assault.

367
00:21:31,817 --> 00:21:32,900
That looks good on you.

368
00:21:34,778 --> 00:21:35,691
I have to say...

369
00:21:35,972 --> 00:21:38,701
It does look a little tight in the
bust area, if you know what I mean.

370
00:21:41,232 --> 00:21:43,667
Yes, well. That's because I drink it every day.

371
00:21:47,124 --> 00:21:49,871
When it comes to milk, it's gotta be Musasino!

372
00:21:53,305 --> 00:21:56,305
There he goes, talking about
breasts, just like he was before.

373
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:58,080
And somehow, it's still not offensive.

374
00:21:59,325 --> 00:22:00,064
Kurozuma...

375
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:04,055
Thank you.

376
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:04,475
The breeze up here really does
feel incredible, don't you think so?

377
00:23:04,663 --> 00:23:06,310
Oh, so that's it, Sissy.

378
00:23:06,491 --> 00:23:08,987
I was wondering why you wanted
to come all the way up here.

379
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:10,288
Oh, look.

380
00:23:10,647 --> 00:23:12,847
Somebody's scrawled graffiti on this railing.

381
00:23:13,857 --> 00:23:15,326
"Mii... Kuro."

382
00:23:15,804 --> 00:23:16,844
Wonder what it means.

383
00:23:17,318 --> 00:23:20,801
It means that no matter what, there
are some feelings that don't change...

384
00:23:21,134 --> 00:23:23,217
It means someone cares about someone else.

385
00:23:27,261 --> 00:23:29,295
Academy City at its best.

386
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,805
I'll never forget the things you showed me, Kuro...

387
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:36,190
The soft caresses, the twilight strolls, the...

388
00:23:36,507 --> 00:23:37,721
Hey, what's with this?

389
00:23:37,746 --> 00:23:38,646
That didn't happen!

390
00:23:38,671 --> 00:23:40,103
We call that payback.
