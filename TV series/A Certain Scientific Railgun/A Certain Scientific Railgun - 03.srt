1
00:00:32,411 --> 00:00:33,324
Who's back there?

2
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:40,188
I am Mitsuko Kongo of Tokiwadai Middle School.
Knowing that, will you still dare to attack me?

3
00:02:45,087 --> 00:02:48,337
I'm so excited! We're going to the Garden of Learning!

4
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,420
I don't know why they gave it such a fancy name.

5
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:53,653
It's just the area of town where there's
a cluster of girls' schools, you know?

6
00:02:53,741 --> 00:02:57,840
But they aren't just any ordinary schools.
The ones in the Garden of Learning are special.

7
00:02:58,167 --> 00:03:02,304
They're all well-known girls' schools.
Tokiwadai Middle School is only one of them.

8
00:03:02,558 --> 00:03:04,523
Yeah, sure, whatever.

9
00:03:05,144 --> 00:03:08,749
We're only allowed in here today because
Shirai was kind enough to invite us.

10
00:03:09,228 --> 00:03:12,920
If she hadn't, a student as lowly and
common as I am would have no business visiting

11
00:03:12,945 --> 00:03:15,130
such an exalted place as this.

12
00:03:15,956 --> 00:03:17,519
Could you please stop groveling?

13
00:03:18,728 --> 00:03:21,003
You're starting to sound like a brown-noser.

14
00:03:21,087 --> 00:03:22,622
Oh, hey. What is this?

15
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:26,820
Oh, I see now. You've got a page highlighted in here.

16
00:03:26,943 --> 00:03:29,739
Is this a bakery you want to try
out while we're visiting, Saten?

17
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:33,172
Well, of course! It's the Pasticceria Manicagni!

18
00:03:33,274 --> 00:03:34,374
Just read what it says.

19
00:03:34,399 --> 00:03:40,511
"The cheesecake is a work of art, made from an authentic
Italian recipe and using only the finest ingredients."

20
00:03:40,551 --> 00:03:42,268
I've always wanted to try a piece,

21
00:03:42,337 --> 00:03:45,758
but the Garden of Learning is the only
place in the whole country where they have it!

22
00:03:46,084 --> 00:03:49,245
You're more of a sucker for
advertising than I thought, Saten.

23
00:03:49,642 --> 00:03:55,347
<i>Next stop, the entrance to the Garden of
Learning. Repeat. Entrance to the Garden of Learning.</i>

24
00:03:59,462 --> 00:04:00,290
Uh... oh.

25
00:04:00,845 --> 00:04:02,893
The bus got us here ahead of schedule, huh?

26
00:04:03,329 --> 00:04:04,776
It shouldn't be a problem.

27
00:04:04,927 --> 00:04:07,524
Three, two and one.

28
00:04:09,313 --> 00:04:13,841
Wow! I've never seen weather forecasts as
accurate as the ones they have in this city.

29
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:16,071
The word "forecast" is so vague.

30
00:04:16,096 --> 00:04:21,305
It's more accurate to say that they are readings
of future events established by precise calculations.

31
00:04:21,525 --> 00:04:23,027
It kinda gets boring, though.

32
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:26,354
It would be more exciting if they
would slip up every once in a while.

33
00:04:26,386 --> 00:04:28,357
Enough of that. Let's get moving!

34
00:04:33,204 --> 00:04:37,254
We have invitations from Kuroko Shirai,
first-year at Tokiwadai Middle School.

35
00:04:37,326 --> 00:04:38,759
I'm Kazari Uiharu.

36
00:04:38,795 --> 00:04:40,025
And I'm Ruiko Saten.

37
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:43,601
Very good. Go on ahead.

38
00:05:08,394 --> 00:05:10,958
This is such a charming area, isn't it?

39
00:05:11,474 --> 00:05:16,073
Everything looks different from the rest of the
world, down to the crosswalks and traffic signals.

40
00:05:16,297 --> 00:05:17,463
Pretty impressive, huh?

41
00:05:18,712 --> 00:05:22,208
It really does feel like we're
tourists visiting a foreign country!

42
00:05:22,391 --> 00:05:23,533
Yeah, it does.

43
00:05:27,589 --> 00:05:31,685
You know, it kinda seems like
we're attracting a lot of attention.

44
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:32,677
Huh?

45
00:05:33,705 --> 00:05:34,784
Yeah, you're right.

46
00:05:34,991 --> 00:05:36,427
I bet it's our outfits.

47
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:39,399
I'm sure it's unusual for them to
see students who aren't from this area.

48
00:05:40,353 --> 00:05:42,019
Yeah. That makes sense.

49
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:45,414
Whoops! Look at the time!

50
00:05:45,826 --> 00:05:47,969
Huh? Oh yeah, you're right.

51
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:50,215
Come on. We should hurry.

52
00:05:54,377 --> 00:05:55,947
It looks like they're running late, huh?

53
00:05:56,721 --> 00:05:58,748
This is where we're supposed to meet them, right?

54
00:05:58,908 --> 00:05:59,948
Yeah, it is.

55
00:05:59,979 --> 00:06:04,116
They said that they wanted to see our school, so
it made sense for them to meet us by the entrance.

56
00:06:04,246 --> 00:06:07,652
How inconsiderate of them,
keeping my Sissy waiting like this.

57
00:06:07,684 --> 00:06:09,298
Oh, here they come now.

58
00:06:11,529 --> 00:06:12,688
What happened to you?

59
00:06:13,735 --> 00:06:17,218
Well, you see... I sort of slipped in a puddle.

60
00:06:17,837 --> 00:06:19,128
Ah...

61
00:06:23,772 --> 00:06:25,793
You asked for a quick change of clothes.

62
00:06:26,116 --> 00:06:29,492
I'm afraid this school uniform's
the only thing I have to offer.

63
00:06:29,667 --> 00:06:31,032
No, this'll be fine.

64
00:06:33,887 --> 00:06:35,174
Does the size work for you?

65
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,977
Oh, yeah, it fits perfectly.

66
00:06:37,574 --> 00:06:40,194
Though the skirt's a bit short, so it's a little breezy.

67
00:06:40,995 --> 00:06:42,926
It's not fair you get to wear that.

68
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,311
Huh?

69
00:06:43,684 --> 00:06:44,319
I know!

70
00:06:44,906 --> 00:06:46,204
We should trade outfits!

71
00:06:46,243 --> 00:06:48,543
What do you say? I think it's a great idea!

72
00:06:48,853 --> 00:06:50,696
Yours is too small for me to wear.

73
00:06:50,721 --> 00:06:52,532
Then, I'll go find a puddle to slip in.

74
00:06:52,557 --> 00:06:53,426
Let it go already.

75
00:06:53,451 --> 00:06:55,270
It will only be for a little while!

76
00:06:55,295 --> 00:06:56,587
Give it up, Uiharu!

77
00:06:56,612 --> 00:06:57,860
Aw, pleeease?

78
00:06:59,406 --> 00:07:01,676
I sent your dirty uniform off to the cleaners.

79
00:07:01,941 --> 00:07:03,548
Stop by there on your way home.

80
00:07:03,721 --> 00:07:06,873
And if that doesn't work, we can
always have it sent to your dorm for you.

81
00:07:06,898 --> 00:07:07,606
It's no trouble.

82
00:07:07,631 --> 00:07:09,599
Wow. That's what I call service.

83
00:07:09,624 --> 00:07:11,848
Do you have maids at your school, too? I bet you do!

84
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:13,522
I bet they come every day!

85
00:07:13,547 --> 00:07:14,723
Oh, calm down.

86
00:07:16,868 --> 00:07:20,537
Hmm... Maybe I want that strawberry crostata.

87
00:07:20,713 --> 00:07:21,475
It looks good.

88
00:07:21,962 --> 00:07:26,146
No, wait... That Monte Bianco over
there looks awfully delicious, too.

89
00:07:26,171 --> 00:07:28,657
Ah! But how could I pass up that cioccolata?

90
00:07:29,522 --> 00:07:32,014
Is it really that difficult of a decision to make?

91
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:35,762
Oh, not for me. I've already
decided on the cheesecake for sure.

92
00:07:36,685 --> 00:07:38,907
Uiharu the sun'll be going down soon.

93
00:07:38,932 --> 00:07:39,747
I'm sorry.

94
00:07:40,135 --> 00:07:41,576
Just one more minute, okay?

95
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,115
Hold on.

96
00:07:45,271 --> 00:07:45,890
Yes?

97
00:07:47,096 --> 00:07:47,533
Huh?

98
00:07:48,454 --> 00:07:49,322
Uh,

99
00:07:50,051 --> 00:07:51,829
okay. Yes, I understand.

100
00:07:52,445 --> 00:07:53,756
Is Judgment calling us in?

101
00:07:53,781 --> 00:07:54,531
They sure are.

102
00:07:54,758 --> 00:07:58,071
Go figure. Their timing couldn't
be any worse if they tried, huh?

103
00:08:00,075 --> 00:08:02,414
We'll get yours wrapped up for take-out, Uiharu.

104
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:03,939
Thanks. I appreciate it.

105
00:08:05,381 --> 00:08:06,559
We should probably hurry.

106
00:08:06,584 --> 00:08:07,096
Yeah!

107
00:08:08,717 --> 00:08:10,171
Always on the move, huh?

108
00:08:11,149 --> 00:08:12,515
Well, I guess it's just us.

109
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,700
Uh, just a sec.

110
00:08:15,065 --> 00:08:17,159
I need to use the ladies' room real quick.

111
00:08:22,025 --> 00:08:24,912
Honestly! Why are they calling us in on our day off?

112
00:08:24,984 --> 00:08:26,121
It's a Saturday!

113
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:26,956
Hey!

114
00:08:27,052 --> 00:08:27,727
Ow!

115
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:30,645
No complaining. You can do that on your own time.

116
00:08:30,812 --> 00:08:32,879
Yes, of course. Sorry, Konori.

117
00:08:33,084 --> 00:08:36,031
So, are you going to tell us why you've called us in?

118
00:08:36,056 --> 00:08:38,527
It began yesterday and continued overnight.

119
00:08:38,828 --> 00:08:40,991
Six students, all from Tokiwadai.

120
00:08:41,301 --> 00:08:43,817
They've been assaulted in a string of related attacks.

121
00:08:46,578 --> 00:08:49,943
What's more, it's all been
happening in the Garden of Learning.

122
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:03,982
There's no one lower than a Level 3
Esper enrolled in Tokiwadai Middle School.

123
00:09:04,732 --> 00:09:08,529
But these students are being targeted and
easily bested, which leads me to believe...

124
00:09:08,554 --> 00:09:11,370
that the perpetrator must be a formidable Esper.

125
00:09:12,435 --> 00:09:13,824
That is likely the case.

126
00:09:14,268 --> 00:09:16,387
However, we don't know their ability.

127
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:17,736
Every victim...

128
00:09:26,341 --> 00:09:28,740
was knocked unconscious using a stun gun.

129
00:09:30,406 --> 00:09:31,213
And then?

130
00:09:31,494 --> 00:09:33,835
What happened to the victims once they were knocked out?

131
00:09:34,543 --> 00:09:36,161
I can show you the photographs.

132
00:09:37,929 --> 00:09:39,005
It's not pretty.

133
00:09:39,855 --> 00:09:42,683
I suggest you prepare yourselves before looking at them.

134
00:09:48,605 --> 00:09:50,240
The tea is starting to get cold.

135
00:09:52,488 --> 00:09:56,229
I've prepared for this sort of thing since
I first applied to be a Judgment officer.

136
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,959
The same goes for me.

137
00:09:59,317 --> 00:09:59,807
Right.

138
00:10:01,173 --> 00:10:02,276
In that case...

139
00:10:08,187 --> 00:10:09,607
Hey, what's taking so long?

140
00:10:13,049 --> 00:10:14,184
What happened?

141
00:10:15,838 --> 00:10:17,013
Saten, wake up!

142
00:10:25,809 --> 00:10:27,150
Targeting our school?

143
00:10:27,769 --> 00:10:30,702
Oh yeah. She was wearing our uniform.

144
00:10:30,934 --> 00:10:32,727
How's she doing? Is she all right?

145
00:10:33,305 --> 00:10:38,239
Well, physically, it's nothing too serious.
She should be fine after she lies down for a bit.

146
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:40,129
It's just...

147
00:10:44,258 --> 00:10:46,298
Have you zeroed in on any suspects yet?

148
00:10:46,323 --> 00:10:47,602
No, not yet.

149
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:51,146
See, their particular ability is making it tricky for us.

150
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:52,534
Tricky in what way?

151
00:10:53,058 --> 00:10:54,794
The attacker was invisible.

152
00:10:57,341 --> 00:11:00,853
I'm telling you, it's true! I
didn't see anything when it happened!

153
00:11:01,059 --> 00:11:03,212
Yes, but here. Take a look.

154
00:11:03,237 --> 00:11:05,442
This is the image from the surveillance camera.

155
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:07,166
I don't care!

156
00:11:07,576 --> 00:11:09,806
For the last time, I didn't see a single thing!

157
00:11:12,253 --> 00:11:14,633
So the victims didn't see their attacker at all.

158
00:11:14,983 --> 00:11:19,308
Naturally, our first idea was that it was an
Esper who could perform optical manipulation.

159
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:21,946
We made a list of forty-seven Espers.

160
00:11:22,288 --> 00:11:25,458
They all have the ability to make
themselves disappear completely.

161
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:28,506
However, every last person on the list has an alibi.

162
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:31,840
Well, whoever it was showed up on
the surveillance cameras, didn't they?

163
00:11:32,087 --> 00:11:34,887
Maybe it's something different than optical manipulation.

164
00:11:35,581 --> 00:11:36,962
That could be the case.

165
00:11:38,071 --> 00:11:38,948
Oh, a dove.

166
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:39,577
Eh?

167
00:11:39,885 --> 00:11:41,611
Shirai, didn't you see it just now?

168
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:44,587
No, sorry. I didn't notice anything.

169
00:11:46,258 --> 00:11:47,639
You didn't notice anything.

170
00:11:48,674 --> 00:11:51,847
Uiharu, there's something I'd like you to try.

171
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:55,776
Here it is.

172
00:11:56,068 --> 00:11:57,739
The ability's name is "Dummy Check."

173
00:11:58,081 --> 00:12:02,020
It's the power to impair the awareness that
a person is looking at a particular subject.

174
00:12:02,998 --> 00:12:04,816
Apparently, only one person has it.

175
00:12:06,274 --> 00:12:09,349
Miho Jufuku, a second-year at Sekichu Middle School.

176
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:11,013
That's our attacker!

177
00:12:11,069 --> 00:12:13,969
I don't think that's possible,
though. She's only a Level 2.

178
00:12:14,353 --> 00:12:15,583
She's not strong enough.

179
00:12:15,727 --> 00:12:19,592
According to her test results, she doesn't
have the power to completely conceal herself.

180
00:12:21,577 --> 00:12:24,219
Man, I really thought we were on the right track, too.

181
00:12:30,385 --> 00:12:31,445
What happened?

182
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:32,274
She's awake!

183
00:12:32,497 --> 00:12:33,759
You should take it easy.

184
00:12:39,768 --> 00:12:41,628
Ahhhhhhhhhhhh!

185
00:12:49,231 --> 00:12:51,521
Come on now. Just get a hold of yourself.

186
00:12:52,865 --> 00:12:55,036
I understand. This has to be a shock.

187
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,215
If your bangs were a little longer, like this
girl's are, you would at least be able to hide it.

188
00:12:59,842 --> 00:13:01,113
Who has long bangs?

189
00:13:02,225 --> 00:13:03,474
Hey! It was her!

190
00:13:04,946 --> 00:13:07,184
You mean you saw the person who did this to you?

191
00:13:07,209 --> 00:13:07,827
That's right.

192
00:13:08,649 --> 00:13:09,538
When it happened...

193
00:13:12,106 --> 00:13:15,154
I saw this girl in the mirror.

194
00:13:16,592 --> 00:13:18,783
First surveillance cameras, now mirrors.

195
00:13:19,044 --> 00:13:20,869
So that's how it is, then. I think I get it.

196
00:13:20,977 --> 00:13:25,459
She can make people unaware of her presence, but
only if they're looking right at her with the naked eye.

197
00:13:27,695 --> 00:13:31,603
That girl made me look like a freak,
and now she's gonna pay for it, big time!

198
00:13:31,866 --> 00:13:33,395
Let's do it, Uiharu!

199
00:13:34,358 --> 00:13:35,032
Do what?

200
00:13:47,752 --> 00:13:49,443
You've got some skills with that thing.

201
00:13:49,468 --> 00:13:53,999
Yeah, well, I have to do it like this, or else the
terminals won't be able to keep up with the processing.

202
00:13:54,497 --> 00:13:59,685
Anyway, the Garden of Learning doesn't fall under the
hundred and seventy-seventh Branch's jurisdiction, Kuroko.

203
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:01,148
Are you sure this is okay?

204
00:14:01,309 --> 00:14:03,649
Our superiors have just given us the go ahead.

205
00:14:03,738 --> 00:14:06,603
Now you're talking! Uiharu,
let's get this show on the road.

206
00:14:07,198 --> 00:14:09,142
I'm on it. And, "Go."

207
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,120
There you have it, girls.

208
00:14:15,184 --> 00:14:19,649
We are now connected to all two thousand fifty-eight
surveillance cameras in the Garden of Learning.

209
00:14:20,944 --> 00:14:26,465
I'll find you now, creepy chick with the long bangs.
Just you wait. You're gonna get what's coming to you soon.

210
00:14:26,607 --> 00:14:29,267
I still haven't forgotten that
cake you promised me earlier.

211
00:14:29,566 --> 00:14:32,238
Do this and I'll get you a dozen of them if you want.

212
00:14:32,263 --> 00:14:33,214
Yeah!

213
00:14:33,612 --> 00:14:34,858
That's going to be too many.

214
00:14:35,129 --> 00:14:36,179
Oh, you think so?

215
00:14:36,395 --> 00:14:38,388
Really? Cause I don't see any harm in it.

216
00:14:38,413 --> 00:14:40,323
We're not talking about cake anymore, you two.

217
00:14:40,348 --> 00:14:40,885
Huh?

218
00:14:41,596 --> 00:14:45,748
Uiharu, go ahead and exclude areas
E through H, as well as J and N.

219
00:14:46,012 --> 00:14:47,084
Okay.

220
00:14:49,091 --> 00:14:52,327
Those are the areas the furthest
distance away from Tokiwadai.

221
00:14:52,529 --> 00:14:56,041
Since they're so far, students from
our school rarely have reason to go there.

222
00:14:56,983 --> 00:15:00,337
I think we can go ahead and
exclude high-traffic areas, too.

223
00:15:00,902 --> 00:15:02,107
Why do you say that?

224
00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:03,815
The suspect's uniform.

225
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:07,191
Don't you think it would stand
out a bit in the Garden of Learning?

226
00:15:09,188 --> 00:15:10,074
Yeah, it would.

227
00:15:10,099 --> 00:15:14,063
Think she uses her ability whenever people
are around, even when she's not attacking?

228
00:15:14,301 --> 00:15:18,884
Probably. Even so, she can't
possibly maintain it 24 hours a day.

229
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:23,081
Then she'll have to find someplace out of
the way so she'll be able to catch her breath.

230
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:24,924
Exactly!

231
00:15:25,471 --> 00:15:27,286
And if that is the case, then...

232
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:49,546
You should put that away.

233
00:15:51,479 --> 00:15:56,831
You were the one who gave me these ridiculous
eyebrows. I fully intend to pay you back with interest.

234
00:15:59,146 --> 00:16:00,445
She really disappeared.

235
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:03,616
This is no time to be impressed. Go after her, Saten!

236
00:16:03,942 --> 00:16:05,347
All right, I'm on my way.

237
00:16:09,659 --> 00:16:10,306
Ow!

238
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:11,857
What just happened?

239
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:14,123
Something bumped into me, but I don't know what it was.

240
00:16:15,244 --> 00:16:16,231
Coming through!

241
00:16:16,854 --> 00:16:17,995
Be careful!

242
00:16:25,301 --> 00:16:26,166
Here we go.

243
00:16:32,456 --> 00:16:34,212
As you can see, I'm with Judgment.

244
00:16:34,434 --> 00:16:36,821
I'm taking you into custody. Come quietly, or...

245
00:16:39,509 --> 00:16:41,733
Yep. She was never going to come quietly.

246
00:16:42,521 --> 00:16:45,062
Uiharu, could I get some directions, please?

247
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:45,872
Working on it.

248
00:16:46,645 --> 00:16:49,814
Go out to the street, turn
left, then go up to Third Avenue.

249
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:51,420
Copy that. Thanks a lot.

250
00:16:51,621 --> 00:16:52,157
Sure.

251
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:56,261
How?

252
00:16:59,373 --> 00:17:00,281
How?

253
00:17:01,136 --> 00:17:01,814
How?

254
00:17:29,211 --> 00:17:30,719
This game has been fun.

255
00:17:31,761 --> 00:17:33,059
But it's all over now.

256
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:37,619
Impossible. Why isn't my Dummy Check working anymore?

257
00:17:39,337 --> 00:17:40,193
Who can say?

258
00:17:42,017 --> 00:17:44,571
This is why I hate all you brats from Tokiwadai!

259
00:17:57,745 --> 00:18:01,269
Nice try. But, you see, stun guns
don't really have any effect on me.

260
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:05,019
Uh, um...

261
00:18:13,623 --> 00:18:15,226
And that was actually holding back.

262
00:18:15,483 --> 00:18:20,775
Uiharu! Please contact Antiskill and inform them
that we have successfully apprehended the suspect.

263
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,936
Right.

264
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:23,237
Good work today!

265
00:18:28,106 --> 00:18:29,559
One last thing to do.

266
00:18:36,447 --> 00:18:40,002
So, what'll it be? What kind
of eyebrows should I give her?

267
00:18:44,672 --> 00:18:45,299
No!

268
00:18:46,864 --> 00:18:47,771
Oh, dear.

269
00:18:47,796 --> 00:18:48,865
Funny looking, right?

270
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:51,085
Oh, well, uh...

271
00:18:51,618 --> 00:18:52,721
Go ahead and laugh!

272
00:18:53,167 --> 00:18:55,608
Laugh as loud as you can. Just like he did!

273
00:18:56,726 --> 00:18:57,771
Just like who?

274
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,356
It was spring.

275
00:19:03,955 --> 00:19:07,229
I was dozing off in the glorious midday sunshine.

276
00:19:08,082 --> 00:19:12,782
In my naiveté, I believed that this time
of peace and comfort would last forever.

277
00:19:13,613 --> 00:19:14,253
But then...

278
00:19:19,286 --> 00:19:20,952
Spring came to an end.

279
00:19:21,767 --> 00:19:22,965
It was so sudden.

280
00:19:23,581 --> 00:19:27,455
Tell me why! Are girls from Tokiwadai really so special?

281
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,733
That's not exactly the reason.

282
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:30,075
Then what is it?

283
00:19:30,433 --> 00:19:32,433
Well, your eyebrows are just so...

284
00:19:33,212 --> 00:19:34,924
Weird!

285
00:19:40,191 --> 00:19:42,462
I hated the boy who cast me aside,

286
00:19:43,123 --> 00:19:46,742
and I hated the dumb girl from
Tokiwadai who took him away from me!

287
00:19:47,707 --> 00:19:52,395
But more than anything else, I hated
the funny eyebrows that ruined my life!

288
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:56,288
And that's why I decided I would
give everybody funny eyebrows like mine!

289
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:57,632
Uh, what?

290
00:19:57,718 --> 00:20:00,214
Yeah, sorry. You lost me about halfway through, there.

291
00:20:01,974 --> 00:20:02,812
What's the matter?

292
00:20:03,719 --> 00:20:06,512
Just go ahead. Laugh at me! You know you want to!

293
00:20:07,268 --> 00:20:07,893
Um...

294
00:20:08,543 --> 00:20:09,739
I, uh...

295
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:13,424
I don't think they're weird.

296
00:20:14,495 --> 00:20:15,608
Not weird they're just...

297
00:20:16,011 --> 00:20:16,673
um...

298
00:20:17,487 --> 00:20:22,349
Yeah! They give your face character, that's
what it is. Personally, I really like them!

299
00:20:27,801 --> 00:20:29,760
Now that's taking it too far.

300
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:45,398
I, uh...

301
00:20:46,059 --> 00:20:48,850
Is it okay if I sent you a letter sometime?

302
00:20:50,949 --> 00:20:51,775
That's fine.

303
00:21:06,072 --> 00:21:07,001
Impressive.

304
00:21:07,374 --> 00:21:09,779
She really could make herself disappear completely.

305
00:21:10,303 --> 00:21:13,641
Now that you mention it, wasn't
she listed as a Level 2 Esper?

306
00:21:13,914 --> 00:21:14,795
That is odd.

307
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:18,931
I wonder, could the info in the database be incorrect?

308
00:21:19,763 --> 00:21:21,199
No, of course not!

309
00:21:26,724 --> 00:21:28,264
What is going on here?

310
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:31,819
Oh? The other victims too, huh? Yes, I see.

311
00:21:32,238 --> 00:21:37,049
Here's the thing. It's a special ink developed
by a university in the tenth school district.

312
00:21:37,752 --> 00:21:40,368
They say there's no way it's
coming off sooner than a week.

313
00:21:43,788 --> 00:21:47,546
What now, Saten? Do you want me to
get that cute hat ready for you again?

314
00:21:48,276 --> 00:21:49,374
That jerk.

315
00:21:49,569 --> 00:21:53,063
Stupid eyebrow girl! I knew I
should've drawn something on her!

316
00:21:53,117 --> 00:21:55,660
Calm down, Saten! Get a hold of yourself!

317
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,300
What am I gonna do?

Hey, Uiharu. Have you heard of the sandal hag?

319
00:23:32,684 --> 00:23:33,809
The sandal hag?

320
00:23:33,834 --> 00:23:36,724
They say she's this ugly old woman
in sandals who chases after you!

321
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:37,409
Yikes!

322
00:23:37,434 --> 00:23:38,463
And she's butt naked!

323
00:23:38,488 --> 00:23:39,560
That's just gross!
