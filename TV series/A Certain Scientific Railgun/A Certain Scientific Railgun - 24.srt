1
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,468
A Level Six Esper?

2
00:00:06,349 --> 00:00:07,007
Yes.

3
00:00:07,446 --> 00:00:09,168
That's what you will become, dear.

4
00:00:09,626 --> 00:00:13,084
You will be the very embodiment
of Academy City's greatest dream.

5
00:00:14,915 --> 00:00:16,151
Oh, Grandfather!

6
00:00:16,176 --> 00:00:17,971
How amazing! Will that really happen?

7
00:00:18,886 --> 00:00:19,767
Yes.

8
00:00:20,392 --> 00:00:23,913
Today... we lay the groundwork... dear.

9
00:00:33,806 --> 00:00:35,899
Yellow Marble leader reporting in, ma'am.

10
00:00:36,569 --> 00:00:37,391
We have arrived.

11
00:00:38,097 --> 00:00:39,632
Now commencing installation.

12
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,992
Brown Marble leader, how are you coming along.?

13
00:00:43,282 --> 00:00:44,796
Is the blue car following you?

14
00:00:45,391 --> 00:00:46,327
Right on schedule.

15
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:49,496
Then it's time to put an end to these foolish dreams.

16
00:00:54,245 --> 00:00:55,403
I'm tired of waiting.

17
00:00:55,629 --> 00:00:57,141
Let's move right to the finale.

18
00:01:01,034 --> 00:01:02,195
Just you wait.

19
00:01:02,541 --> 00:01:04,235
When I get my hands on you...

20
00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:19,692
What was that?

21
00:01:20,708 --> 00:01:21,422
Come on...

22
00:01:21,724 --> 00:01:23,332
Is this really your idea of fun?

23
00:01:24,576 --> 00:01:26,687
Just a fancy little trick I wanted to try.

24
00:01:26,974 --> 00:01:28,041
What are you doing?

25
00:01:28,892 --> 00:01:31,432
Why the hell did you choose now to interfere?

26
00:01:31,613 --> 00:01:32,837
Well, say something!

27
00:01:36,582 --> 00:01:37,707
Dr. Kiyama!

28
00:01:37,762 --> 00:01:39,521
Those trucks are only decoys!

29
00:01:39,546 --> 00:01:41,173
The children aren't inside them!

30
00:01:41,415 --> 00:01:42,847
They're not there? But...

31
00:01:43,279 --> 00:01:44,324
Come on, Saten, hurry.

32
00:01:44,348 --> 00:01:45,084
Hey wait, calm down, I'm going.

33
00:01:45,109 --> 00:01:46,790
What do you two girls think you're doing?

34
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:48,251
Watch it. You're squishing me!

35
00:01:48,276 --> 00:01:49,443
Just sit still!

36
00:01:49,918 --> 00:01:51,492
I'm going to be your navigator.

37
00:01:51,517 --> 00:01:52,318
Now, get in!

38
00:01:52,407 --> 00:01:54,115
You want to save the children, right?

39
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,695
Okay, get ready, Sissy!

40
00:02:11,793 --> 00:02:14,190
If you guys wanna fight, I'm happy to play along.

41
00:02:18,498 --> 00:02:20,091
Helicopter, huh?

42
00:02:20,672 --> 00:02:22,343
I think you're about done here.

43
00:02:28,423 --> 00:02:31,658
Ugh. I recognize that ability all too well.

44
00:02:31,907 --> 00:02:33,780
I think you can relax, ladies.

45
00:02:34,374 --> 00:02:35,806
The cavalry is here.

46
00:02:36,063 --> 00:02:38,803
Try not to be too intimidated by my ability.

47
00:02:39,423 --> 00:02:42,067
"Aero Hand" will make swift work of our opponents.

48
00:02:42,415 --> 00:02:43,659
That was good timing!

49
00:02:45,481 --> 00:02:47,751
Go on. We can take care of things from here.

50
00:02:49,414 --> 00:02:51,936
You go catch up with Kiyama and the others, Sissy.

51
00:02:52,332 --> 00:02:53,022
Kuroko.

52
00:02:55,087 --> 00:02:55,885
All right, then.

53
00:02:57,003 --> 00:02:58,245
But you had better catch up.

54
00:02:58,585 --> 00:02:59,776
Or you'll answer to me!

55
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:02,849
Who would dare to assault me?

56
00:03:02,874 --> 00:03:06,308
I am Kuroko Shirai of Tokiwadai,
partner of the great Railgun!

57
00:03:06,341 --> 00:03:08,654
Hold on! That phrase sounds suspiciously familiar...

58
00:03:09,567 --> 00:03:11,083
Konori! On it!

59
00:03:14,715 --> 00:03:15,582
We're ready now.

60
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:17,392
Let's do this!

61
00:05:08,003 --> 00:05:08,985
I have to say...

62
00:05:09,258 --> 00:05:10,850
This is rather unexpected...

63
00:05:11,156 --> 00:05:13,424
I never thought we would team up for a fight.

64
00:05:13,669 --> 00:05:16,252
We can use this opportunity to settle something:

65
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:18,316
"Whose ability is the greater one"?

66
00:05:24,815 --> 00:05:29,394
Shortly after the other squad moved out, Antiskill
surveillance picked up something interesting.

67
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:34,848
They recorded two transport vehicles posing
as civilian trucks departing MAR headquarters.

68
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:35,716
Most likely...

69
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,315
Those are the real transports.

70
00:05:37,554 --> 00:05:41,535
I can't believe I fell hook, line, and
sinker for that madwoman's amateur trick.

71
00:05:42,488 --> 00:05:43,571
We need to hurry...

72
00:05:43,596 --> 00:05:46,890
It looks like the transport has
already reached its destination.

73
00:05:46,973 --> 00:05:47,718
Where is it?

74
00:05:47,743 --> 00:05:51,165
An unused propulsion system
laboratory in School District 23.

75
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,641
Take this exit on the left.

76
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,536
Oh... Good work, Doctor...

77
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:02,290
Of course, I wouldn't expect
anything less from an opponent like you.

78
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:07,730
Hold on tight!

79
00:06:10,071 --> 00:06:13,358
That's what will make killing you. Such an amusing task!

80
00:06:16,392 --> 00:06:18,184
Hold on, Konori. I've got this!

81
00:06:21,412 --> 00:06:23,418
Hey... what made that thunk just now?

82
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:24,486
Come on, come on!

83
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:27,574
I want to see you run like your life depends on it.

84
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,557
Which, of course, it does.

85
00:06:30,582 --> 00:06:31,976
Better keep moving!

86
00:06:32,001 --> 00:06:33,271
I know that voice.

87
00:06:33,629 --> 00:06:35,614
So do I. That evil witch.

88
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,825
Hey... That's Misaka.

89
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:41,717
Uh... what are you doing out there?

90
00:06:42,624 --> 00:06:44,021
Quick, you need to go faster!

91
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,793
Yes, I kind of noticed that.

92
00:06:51,323 --> 00:06:52,038
I'm sorry.

93
00:06:53,423 --> 00:06:54,477
About before...

94
00:06:55,468 --> 00:06:56,858
I was wrong, I know that.

95
00:06:59,353 --> 00:07:01,070
I suppose I can't really blame you.

96
00:07:01,345 --> 00:07:03,220
In your position, I would have done the same thing.

97
00:07:07,964 --> 00:07:09,506
I'll make up for my failure.

98
00:07:11,311 --> 00:07:12,328
I'll beat her...

99
00:07:12,631 --> 00:07:13,669
I will!

100
00:07:18,155 --> 00:07:19,694
My attacks were deflected!

101
00:07:22,061 --> 00:07:24,967
Did you really think your little
shocks would work against me?

102
00:07:25,573 --> 00:07:26,604
All right, then.

103
00:07:29,522 --> 00:07:30,475
Take this!

104
00:07:34,024 --> 00:07:35,866
I know about that trick, too.

105
00:07:36,631 --> 00:07:37,520
Impossible!

106
00:07:37,545 --> 00:07:39,220
I've done my homework, you see.

107
00:07:39,305 --> 00:07:43,448
I'm up to date on everything they have in
the databank concerning that ability of yours.

108
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:48,086
Including the especially interesting fact
that your railgun's range is only fifty meters.

109
00:07:53,128 --> 00:07:54,763
I'm getting sick of this woman.

110
00:07:55,855 --> 00:07:57,596
Take the next turnoff on the left.

111
00:07:58,957 --> 00:07:59,663
What's that?

112
00:08:01,818 --> 00:08:02,628
I missed...

113
00:08:02,707 --> 00:08:03,564
Oh, well.

114
00:08:05,214 --> 00:08:07,622
The targets are headed your way now, Green Marble.

115
00:08:07,647 --> 00:08:08,482
Crush them.

116
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:09,749
We're under attack!

117
00:08:09,886 --> 00:08:10,828
Take care of it!

118
00:08:14,011 --> 00:08:17,599
There's no way you're getting past
us, so you shouldn't bother trying!

119
00:08:17,624 --> 00:08:18,516
Yes, that's right.

120
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:21,344
We've managed to gain control of
all ramps from this point forward.

121
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:23,934
Sorry, but we're being harried from above, too.

122
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,950
This is the most we can do for you right now.

123
00:08:26,226 --> 00:08:27,790
Why is Antiskill helping me?

124
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:28,849
Never mind that.

125
00:08:29,029 --> 00:08:30,904
Just hurry up and get to those children!

126
00:08:34,215 --> 00:08:36,406
Why am I surrounded by incompetents?

127
00:08:36,553 --> 00:08:38,766
Very well. I'll take care of it myself.

128
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:43,882
Huh? Again?

129
00:08:44,075 --> 00:08:45,329
Hold on tight up there!

130
00:08:59,984 --> 00:09:01,202
It's a lost cause.

131
00:09:01,701 --> 00:09:04,055
Give up, already! You don't stand a chance!

132
00:09:04,693 --> 00:09:07,629
It doesn't matter how hard you try or how fast you run.

133
00:09:07,766 --> 00:09:09,624
You might as well pack up and go home.

134
00:09:09,673 --> 00:09:11,506
You're never gonna be able to save those brats.

135
00:09:11,536 --> 00:09:12,947
I'll make sure of it!

136
00:09:13,201 --> 00:09:14,248
I won't stop.

137
00:09:15,415 --> 00:09:17,163
I swore that I would revive them!

138
00:09:17,949 --> 00:09:19,074
I have to try!

139
00:09:22,138 --> 00:09:25,704
A teacher doesn't give up on her
students just because things get tough!

140
00:09:28,717 --> 00:09:30,409
I would never expect you to.

141
00:09:31,053 --> 00:09:33,915
No matter what happens, I'll make certain you get to them.

142
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:34,953
That's why I'm here.

143
00:09:35,038 --> 00:09:37,503
And I promise you, I'm not gonna give up, either!

144
00:09:38,413 --> 00:09:39,593
Little fools.

145
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:41,752
You don't have any cards left to play now.

146
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:43,897
Just roll over and die!

147
00:09:48,095 --> 00:09:48,911
Misaka!

148
00:10:06,415 --> 00:10:08,987
Ha! Another pathetic attempt!

149
00:10:09,101 --> 00:10:11,060
I know all of your attacks, remember?

150
00:10:11,085 --> 00:10:12,959
Nothing you can do will surprise me!

151
00:10:13,062 --> 00:10:13,928
Oh, really?

152
00:10:13,953 --> 00:10:15,661
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

153
00:10:17,064 --> 00:10:18,847
Kuroko!

154
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:19,966
On my way!

155
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,119
Yes, I can fire coins.

156
00:10:23,874 --> 00:10:24,884
But that isn't all.

157
00:10:25,148 --> 00:10:27,443
I'll show you the full extent of my power!

158
00:10:31,165 --> 00:10:32,082
What the...

159
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:41,022
How rude.

160
00:10:41,408 --> 00:10:43,728
Teleporting away without warning like that.

161
00:10:53,957 --> 00:10:55,582
Shirai, Misaka!

162
00:10:55,665 --> 00:10:58,082
You guys terrified us...! Are you okay?

163
00:10:58,107 --> 00:10:59,611
Yeah, we're fine. Don't worry.

164
00:11:00,124 --> 00:11:01,121
You saved us.

165
00:11:02,165 --> 00:11:02,913
I want to...

166
00:11:02,937 --> 00:11:03,417
Hold on.

167
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:06,182
Don't say it...

168
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,724
Let's wait until after we've saved the children.

169
00:11:12,366 --> 00:11:12,996
Right.

170
00:11:21,615 --> 00:11:22,075
Well?

171
00:11:22,808 --> 00:11:23,734
Can you figure it out?

172
00:11:24,131 --> 00:11:25,170
Almost there.

173
00:11:25,687 --> 00:11:27,540
The security on this is pretty tight.

174
00:11:27,624 --> 00:11:28,569
How annoying.

175
00:11:28,955 --> 00:11:32,543
This would be a lot easier if you
hadn't taken out every single one of them.

176
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,906
Oh, yeah? How was I supposed to know?

177
00:11:34,931 --> 00:11:37,946
I figured they would have left at
least one person inside to guard it.

178
00:11:39,446 --> 00:11:39,973
Got it!

179
00:11:40,869 --> 00:11:45,399
In this facility, there's only one area
where power consumption is especially high.

180
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:47,640
The lowermost block.

181
00:11:55,499 --> 00:11:56,457
I found you!

182
00:11:57,778 --> 00:11:59,826
Haru'ue! Can you hear me?

183
00:12:00,585 --> 00:12:01,281
Wake up!

184
00:12:05,061 --> 00:12:09,083
We came for you! All right...
where's the control panel for this?

185
00:12:09,108 --> 00:12:10,766
Hold on... I'll go look over there.

186
00:12:12,139 --> 00:12:13,213
Great, thank you!

187
00:12:17,827 --> 00:12:18,719
Not long now.

188
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:20,517
We'll get you out of there.

189
00:12:24,442 --> 00:12:26,093
What is it...? What's the matter?

190
00:12:27,712 --> 00:12:29,000
No, that sound again!

191
00:12:29,436 --> 00:12:30,381
It can't be.

192
00:12:30,617 --> 00:12:31,376
But it is.

193
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:34,538
You pesky, meddling brats.

194
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:35,483
Oh, no.

195
00:12:35,992 --> 00:12:36,730
It's her!

196
00:12:37,107 --> 00:12:39,065
This is to pay you back for earlier!

197
00:12:39,457 --> 00:12:41,012
Shirai, Misaka! You okay?

198
00:12:41,037 --> 00:12:42,499
How dare you?!

199
00:12:45,961 --> 00:12:46,668
What was that?

200
00:12:53,996 --> 00:12:55,766
Ah... that felt good.

201
00:12:56,728 --> 00:12:57,807
You think you can get away
with making me look like a fool?

202
00:12:57,832 --> 00:12:58,625
Her again!

203
00:13:00,601 --> 00:13:02,435
You're using Capacity Down!

204
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:05,295
Misaka described it to us before...

205
00:13:05,395 --> 00:13:07,782
The sound it emits only affects Espers!

206
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:09,790
This is Capacity Down?

207
00:13:09,815 --> 00:13:10,833
What's your point?

208
00:13:11,055 --> 00:13:14,015
Knowing what it does isn't going to protect you from it.

209
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,847
She told us that you'd upgraded it, though.

210
00:13:15,976 --> 00:13:18,601
That the speakers were a lot bigger than they were before.

211
00:13:18,692 --> 00:13:20,307
Too big to be moved easily.

212
00:13:20,548 --> 00:13:21,360
That's right.

213
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:24,357
It wasn't easy to do, but I've
placed them throughout the facility.

214
00:13:24,668 --> 00:13:27,328
Would you care to go around destroying them one by one?

215
00:13:27,855 --> 00:13:29,924
It still has to have a control center.

216
00:13:30,122 --> 00:13:32,181
And its size limits where that could be.

217
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:35,151
I know a little about this building's structure.

218
00:13:35,449 --> 00:13:36,538
From what I can tell...

219
00:13:36,746 --> 00:13:39,609
the power center must be back where we just were.

220
00:13:40,135 --> 00:13:41,812
The central control room!

221
00:13:42,193 --> 00:13:43,066
Uiharu...

222
00:13:44,265 --> 00:13:45,275
You might be right.

223
00:13:47,261 --> 00:13:48,556
But what does that matter?

224
00:13:48,999 --> 00:13:50,932
There's nothing you can do about it now.

225
00:13:52,585 --> 00:13:55,426
Ugh. Do all little girls talk as much as you?

226
00:13:56,663 --> 00:13:57,732
You should thank me.

227
00:13:57,757 --> 00:13:59,774
I'm about to show you something amazing.

228
00:14:00,113 --> 00:14:02,238
The culmination of years of research.

229
00:14:02,263 --> 00:14:04,183
The completion of the ability crystal.

230
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:05,805
How can you?

231
00:14:07,432 --> 00:14:08,639
I don't understand.

232
00:14:08,664 --> 00:14:10,119
You're a victim in this, too.

233
00:14:10,744 --> 00:14:13,327
Your own grandfather used you for his experiments.

234
00:14:13,657 --> 00:14:16,037
He made your ability run out of control.

235
00:14:16,366 --> 00:14:17,556
And yet here you are.

236
00:14:17,644 --> 00:14:18,519
You're wrong.

237
00:14:18,619 --> 00:14:19,731
I'm no victim.

238
00:14:21,013 --> 00:14:22,988
I'm Academy City's ultimate dream.

239
00:14:23,361 --> 00:14:25,652
This seed of greatness was born thanks to me.

240
00:14:25,847 --> 00:14:27,513
And I intend to let it bloom.

241
00:14:27,538 --> 00:14:29,502
It can't be. That vial.

242
00:14:29,527 --> 00:14:31,042
It contains the First Sample?

243
00:14:31,898 --> 00:14:35,015
Using this, I am finally going to create a Level 6.

244
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:35,417
Hah!

245
00:14:36,191 --> 00:14:37,286
A Level 6?

246
00:14:37,555 --> 00:14:38,314
No way.

247
00:14:38,338 --> 00:14:39,240
Oh, yes.

248
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,040
This young girl is about to become the
first esper in Academy City to reach Level 6.

249
00:14:44,404 --> 00:14:47,097
The power of the other children will flow into her!

250
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:52,018
You can't do it!

251
00:14:52,236 --> 00:14:53,380
Not Haru'ue!

252
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:03,890
Under specific wavelengths, she has
a reception ability above her level.

253
00:15:04,648 --> 00:15:09,807
It was truly a stroke of luck to find someone whose
ability can resonate with the crystal like hers can.

254
00:15:10,288 --> 00:15:12,962
High-level Telepaths are quite rare, after all.

255
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:14,138
Why them?

256
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:16,782
Why use these same children again?

257
00:15:17,421 --> 00:15:20,337
Why are they always the ones who have to suffer the most?

258
00:15:20,832 --> 00:15:21,943
It's not so bad.

259
00:15:22,247 --> 00:15:24,046
They probably won't even feel a thing.

260
00:15:24,407 --> 00:15:28,106
I'm just going to borrow the realities
they've created inside their minds.

261
00:15:28,324 --> 00:15:30,514
You're talking about Personal Reality.

262
00:15:31,151 --> 00:15:32,865
You can call it whatever you want.

263
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,844
Shall I explain the process to you?

264
00:15:35,126 --> 00:15:39,619
Essentially, I'm extracting the neurotransmitters
that control activity within the brain.

265
00:15:39,943 --> 00:15:44,466
Particularly those which make them runaway
Espers and fusing them with the First Sample.

266
00:15:45,004 --> 00:15:48,431
By doing so, I will create an
inhibitor for the ability crystal.

267
00:15:48,763 --> 00:15:50,697
And it will be perfected at last.

268
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,708
The old geezer never could figure it out.

269
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:57,815
He spent all his time applying minor
changes that were ultimately useless.

270
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:00,775
And now... only one step left.

271
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,651
Don't do it!

272
00:16:03,409 --> 00:16:04,224
Why not?

273
00:16:04,319 --> 00:16:06,155
Do you realize what will happen?

274
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:10,025
If you do this, and the children
awaken while still in their runaway state.

275
00:16:10,216 --> 00:16:15,284
Then Academy City will be hit by an unprecedented
wave of poltergeisting, and it will be destroyed.

276
00:16:16,713 --> 00:16:18,399
So what? That's fine by me.

277
00:16:20,288 --> 00:16:24,541
"Someone who attains the power of God
while still inhabiting a mortal body."

278
00:16:27,605 --> 00:16:30,198
Creating such a person is the whole point of this city!

279
00:16:30,393 --> 00:16:35,147
And once that's done, there's no real reason
for Academy City to remain standing anymore.

280
00:16:40,579 --> 00:16:41,114
Careful.

281
00:16:42,124 --> 00:16:43,807
You're going to get yourself hurt.

282
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:45,490
Dr. Kiyam...

283
00:16:45,888 --> 00:16:48,659
Just lay there and be quiet like a good little girl.

284
00:16:48,684 --> 00:16:49,479
Please, Saten!

285
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:50,840
Please hurry!

286
00:16:53,337 --> 00:16:54,102
Come on!

287
00:16:54,443 --> 00:16:55,205
Where is it?

288
00:16:55,579 --> 00:16:57,816
I have to find that Capacity Down thingy!

289
00:17:00,228 --> 00:17:02,346
You said something interesting before.

290
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:03,301
I can hear her.

291
00:17:03,832 --> 00:17:06,328
That Skill Out members weren't my lab rats.

292
00:17:06,493 --> 00:17:09,099
Well, you were just one word away from being correct.

293
00:17:09,124 --> 00:17:11,165
They aren't my only lab rats.

294
00:17:11,246 --> 00:17:13,787
No, you are all my lab rats, don't you see?

295
00:17:14,311 --> 00:17:16,647
Would you prefer a different analogy? Very well.

296
00:17:16,766 --> 00:17:21,096
Academy City is my breeding farm,
and all you children are my livestock.

297
00:17:22,044 --> 00:17:23,560
Misaka... hang on...

298
00:17:24,249 --> 00:17:26,243
I think it's time to put you down, though.

299
00:17:26,637 --> 00:17:27,419
What the?

300
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:28,540
What was that?

301
00:17:29,492 --> 00:17:31,568
I don't give a damn if you think we're lab rats.

302
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:32,909
Don't forget.

303
00:17:32,934 --> 00:17:34,459
Rats have sharp teeth!

304
00:17:34,855 --> 00:17:35,659
That sounds like.

305
00:17:35,774 --> 00:17:37,035
Thank goodness! Saten!

306
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:38,668
There's another one of you brats here?

307
00:17:38,693 --> 00:17:39,860
How is she still standing?

308
00:17:39,885 --> 00:17:41,267
I'm not going to tell you twice.

309
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,018
Keep your hands off my friends!

310
00:17:46,891 --> 00:17:47,660
It went away!

311
00:17:47,684 --> 00:17:48,388
Damn it!

312
00:18:03,388 --> 00:18:04,310
Fine, then.

313
00:18:04,582 --> 00:18:06,804
Looks like it's time to change tactics.

314
00:18:06,829 --> 00:18:08,759
Fortunately, I have a plan B.

315
00:18:08,959 --> 00:18:11,245
I'm going to blow you and this whole place away!

316
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:16,115
I built this particular weapon
after carefully analyzing your ability.

317
00:18:16,274 --> 00:18:18,649
It's even more powerful than your railgun.

318
00:18:18,716 --> 00:18:22,204
Honestly, first laboratory rats, then livestock.

319
00:18:22,229 --> 00:18:26,462
How bitter and pathetic do you have to
be to think so lowly of other human beings?

320
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,838
You may be a Level 5 Electromaster.

321
00:18:29,369 --> 00:18:32,389
In this town, however, you're
nothing more than a bunch of data.

322
00:18:33,077 --> 00:18:35,489
That's right! Just a bunch of
data with two legs and a smart mouth!

323
00:18:35,522 --> 00:18:36,934
That's where you've got it all wrong.

324
00:18:37,301 --> 00:18:39,819
The people of Academy City are so much more than that.

325
00:18:39,962 --> 00:18:42,065
Anything is possible in this place.

326
00:18:42,696 --> 00:18:44,250
Here we can achieve greatness.

327
00:18:45,876 --> 00:18:47,698
In a way that we couldn't anywhere else.

328
00:18:48,777 --> 00:18:49,652
So you see.

329
00:18:49,885 --> 00:18:51,427
You think you're human beings?

330
00:18:51,478 --> 00:18:52,682
You're just samples.

331
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:54,784
That's what Academy City was made for!

332
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:57,976
I'll stop you... for the sake of my city!

333
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:43,000
That was nice work.

334
00:19:44,871 --> 00:19:46,663
You saved all our lives, Saten.

335
00:19:59,983 --> 00:20:00,724
Is that it?

336
00:20:01,415 --> 00:20:01,882
Yes.

337
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,234
The program is complete.

338
00:20:05,362 --> 00:20:06,095
And now.

339
00:20:13,848 --> 00:20:15,299
Go on, it's all right.

340
00:20:18,165 --> 00:20:19,377
Banri spoke to me.

341
00:20:20,165 --> 00:20:21,567
She wanted me to tell you.

342
00:20:22,124 --> 00:20:23,387
"I trust you, teacher."

343
00:20:52,249 --> 00:20:53,144
Teacher?

344
00:20:55,332 --> 00:20:56,676
You look tired...

345
00:20:56,925 --> 00:20:59,826
Why do you have those dark circles under your eyes?

346
00:21:04,372 --> 00:21:06,609
I... I've just been very busy.

347
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,722
There was so much work to do.

348
00:21:11,936 --> 00:21:12,884
Oh, yeah.

349
00:21:13,276 --> 00:21:14,352
And you know what?

350
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,849
Your hair's longer.

351
00:21:16,913 --> 00:21:17,778
It's her, though.

352
00:21:18,363 --> 00:21:19,542
That's our teacher.

353
00:21:20,098 --> 00:21:21,368
It's Miss Kiyama.

354
00:21:21,505 --> 00:21:22,420
She's here!

355
00:21:25,207 --> 00:21:26,839
My children are all awake.

356
00:21:29,045 --> 00:21:30,155
Hey, Erii.

357
00:21:33,116 --> 00:21:34,403
I want to thank you...

358
00:21:35,051 --> 00:21:36,397
for hearing my voice.

359
00:21:36,991 --> 00:21:38,448
You're a true friend.

360
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:41,248
Yeah!

361
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:49,137
All right...

362
00:21:49,605 --> 00:21:50,843
can I finish saying it now?

363
00:21:52,877 --> 00:21:54,210
Thank you so much.

364
00:22:08,872 --> 00:22:10,484
How can I describe it best?

365
00:22:10,509 --> 00:22:12,444
A battle of singular heroism!

366
00:22:13,196 --> 00:22:16,227
Of course, it didn't take long for
Shirai to lose her nerve and run away...

367
00:22:16,363 --> 00:22:18,126
but I wasn't about to let that stop me.

368
00:22:18,151 --> 00:22:21,288
I stood firm, facing the enemy
head-on, defeating them easily.

369
00:22:21,313 --> 00:22:26,515
Wow! Then you were the one who finally put an end
to all the dreadful poltergeisting that was happening?

370
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:28,081
Oh, was it really you, Kongo?

371
00:22:28,349 --> 00:22:29,923
We should have known!

372
00:22:31,346 --> 00:22:32,299
When is it coming?

373
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:33,687
Any moment now.

374
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:35,452
Aw, man, I can't wait!

375
00:22:36,029 --> 00:22:36,990
So, where are they?

376
00:22:37,265 --> 00:22:39,013
Uiharu and the others.

377
00:22:39,128 --> 00:22:42,279
She said they would be along in just
a minute and we should go on ahead.

378
00:22:42,798 --> 00:22:44,671
They're running later than I thought, though.

379
00:22:44,829 --> 00:22:45,912
I hope they make it.

380
00:22:45,937 --> 00:22:47,186
This is a special day.

381
00:22:48,451 --> 00:22:50,826
We have to hurry! I don't want to miss it!

382
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:53,645
Misaka, Shirai, it's unlike you to be late.

383
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:54,815
What's gotten into you?

384
00:22:54,922 --> 00:22:58,972
Honestly! Of all days, Sissy, this
is the one you choose to sleep in on?

385
00:22:59,374 --> 00:23:00,196
Shut up!

386
00:23:00,312 --> 00:23:02,500
You were sleeping every bit as soundly as I was!

387
00:23:02,805 --> 00:23:04,805
I have to admit, I'm kinda surprised.

388
00:23:05,023 --> 00:23:08,089
I would never have expected Misaka
to come up with something like this.

389
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:09,561
What are you talking about?

390
00:23:09,906 --> 00:23:13,199
It's sweet and generous and
thoughtful, just like Misaka is.

391
00:23:13,247 --> 00:23:13,892
Yeah...

392
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:15,948
I don't think I'd go that far.

393
00:23:19,238 --> 00:23:20,120
Hello, Shirai?

394
00:23:20,817 --> 00:23:22,848
Oh? You haven't gotten there yet?

395
00:23:24,127 --> 00:23:26,523
No, I don't need anything from you guys right now.

396
00:23:26,956 --> 00:23:30,320
Just calling to let you know that
you-know-who's regained consciousness.

397
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:34,190
We've begun interrogating her, but I don't
think she's going to give much up easily.

398
00:23:34,736 --> 00:23:35,868
Yeah, I agree.

399
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:37,272
All right.

400
00:23:37,659 --> 00:23:38,846
Thanks for letting me know.

401
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:40,711
What is it?

402
00:23:41,099 --> 00:23:45,066
It's going to be a long time before we
have a full account of Therestina's crimes.

403
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:48,123
Hey! What are we doing standing around?

404
00:23:48,148 --> 00:23:48,984
We need to hurry!

405
00:23:50,526 --> 00:23:51,778
Look...! Up there!

406
00:23:54,715 --> 00:23:55,599
Hey, it's here!

407
00:23:55,623 --> 00:23:56,215
Look, there it is!

408
00:23:56,499 --> 00:23:56,977
Where?

409
00:23:57,564 --> 00:23:57,966
Look!

410
00:23:57,990 --> 00:23:58,980
That's so cool!

411
00:24:09,371 --> 00:24:12,088
Okay. One, two, three...

412
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,227
Ready, go!

413
00:24:15,801 --> 00:24:17,175
We just wanted to say...

414
00:24:17,511 --> 00:24:19,604
Happy birthday Miss Kiyama!

415
00:24:20,928 --> 00:24:22,932
Rest up and get well soon, okay?

416
00:24:22,957 --> 00:24:23,742
We'll do the same!

417
00:24:23,766 --> 00:24:24,832
I can't wait to see you again!

418
00:24:24,857 --> 00:24:25,475
Me, neither!

419
00:24:25,831 --> 00:24:26,968
Bye for now, Teacher...

420
00:24:26,993 --> 00:24:28,318
Thank you so much!

421
00:24:30,754 --> 00:24:32,093
We love you!

422
00:25:00,985 --> 00:25:02,800
There's never a dull moment, is there?

423
00:25:07,221 --> 00:25:08,603
Not in this city.
