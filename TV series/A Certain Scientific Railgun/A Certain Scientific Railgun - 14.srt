1
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:05,997
You know what we should do?

2
00:00:06,531 --> 00:00:08,206
We should go see a movie today.

3
00:00:08,259 --> 00:00:08,999
What do you think?

4
00:00:09,944 --> 00:00:11,660
A movie? Yeah, maybe.

5
00:00:12,105 --> 00:00:14,184
Here, this looks like a good one, doesn't it?

6
00:00:14,324 --> 00:00:16,449
It's called "Caught Between Love and Youth."

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,094
Yeah, sounds okay...

8
00:00:19,327 --> 00:00:21,837
I guess I like a romance flick as much as the next girl.

9
00:00:22,198 --> 00:00:23,043
Oh, really?

10
00:00:23,137 --> 00:00:24,735
You don't sound all that interested.

11
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,245
I don't care one way or the other.

12
00:00:26,736 --> 00:00:28,048
We both have the day off.

13
00:00:28,073 --> 00:00:29,837
I thought we could do something together.

14
00:00:29,862 --> 00:00:34,816
Hey! It looks like they're having some kind of
summer festival on the rooftop over at Seventh Mist.

15
00:00:34,857 --> 00:00:39,543
Oh? My guess is it's just some
silly event designed to amuse children.

16
00:00:40,271 --> 00:00:42,437
We won't know for sure unless we see it, will we?

17
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:45,451
Uh... well, I mean...

18
00:00:45,591 --> 00:00:48,475
it might be nice to try something
new every once in a while.

19
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:50,302
Oh, I see what it is...

20
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:54,265
This is what you're really interested
in checking out, isn't it, Sissy?

21
00:00:56,248 --> 00:00:59,416
It's not! I couldn't care less about some stupid thing...

22
00:00:59,441 --> 00:01:00,772
No need to be ashamed, Sissy...

23
00:01:00,956 --> 00:01:02,648
You can tell me if you like Gekota.

24
00:01:02,673 --> 00:01:03,331
It's all right.

25
00:01:03,356 --> 00:01:04,279
I told you, I don't care!

26
00:01:04,304 --> 00:01:04,850
Sorry I'm late!

27
00:01:06,335 --> 00:01:08,233
I hope you haven't been waiting for too long.

28
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:09,772
I missed the first bus.

29
00:01:09,797 --> 00:01:11,348
No, no, don't worry about it!

30
00:01:11,373 --> 00:01:13,053
We only just got here ourselves.

31
00:01:13,331 --> 00:01:15,456
Hey, Saten's not with you today?

32
00:01:16,397 --> 00:01:18,370
Oh... well, you see...

33
00:01:19,191 --> 00:01:22,145
Man! Extra classes on a day off?

34
00:01:22,375 --> 00:01:24,417
That's a dirty trick for them to play.

35
00:01:24,442 --> 00:01:27,546
Yeah... and it's not just our
middle school that's doing it, either.

36
00:01:27,571 --> 00:01:32,110
They're calling students together from all over
to participate in some special workshop for the day.

37
00:01:32,228 --> 00:01:33,002
A workshop?

38
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:33,752
That's right...

39
00:01:33,901 --> 00:01:35,693
I don't know what makes it special, though.

40
00:01:35,839 --> 00:01:38,741
Well, special or not, it's bad luck for poor Saten.

41
00:01:39,151 --> 00:01:41,561
Such a beautiful day to be stuck in class.

42
00:03:33,542 --> 00:03:35,945
This is it... at least I think so.

43
00:03:59,602 --> 00:04:00,490
Let's see here...

44
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:03,285
Hey! Ruiko!

45
00:04:05,338 --> 00:04:07,057
Akemi! Mu! Mako!

46
00:04:07,174 --> 00:04:07,820
Hey, guys.

47
00:04:09,089 --> 00:04:11,399
What's with making us climb all these stairs?

48
00:04:11,482 --> 00:04:12,746
I'm exhausted.

49
00:04:12,809 --> 00:04:15,154
Don't be such babies. We just got here.

50
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,464
Yeah, well...

51
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:18,174
It was a whole lot of steps!

52
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,558
This way, then.

53
00:04:27,255 --> 00:04:29,590
Honestly, this is the worst...

54
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:33,260
Going to some school on our day off
to take extra classes, and for what?

55
00:04:33,285 --> 00:04:35,983
It's not like they're gonna teach
us how to raise our ability levels.

56
00:04:36,008 --> 00:04:37,432
That would be too easy, wouldn't it?

57
00:04:38,739 --> 00:04:40,879
Normally, I'd be sitting by the pool right now.

58
00:04:42,466 --> 00:04:46,133
And what about you? You were planning to
hang out with Uiharu today, weren't you?

59
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,621
Well... What choice do we have?

60
00:04:54,307 --> 00:04:57,023
What're we gonna do with you, not even putting up a fight?

61
00:04:57,316 --> 00:04:58,247
Oh, come on...

62
00:04:58,286 --> 00:04:59,858
You won't even complain a little?

63
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:00,789
You're hopeless.

64
00:05:01,353 --> 00:05:04,444
Hey, we've got a long day ahead. Be nice!

65
00:05:05,595 --> 00:05:08,251
Well, the quicker we get started, the quicker it'll end.

66
00:05:08,571 --> 00:05:09,640
Let's hope so.

67
00:05:22,712 --> 00:05:25,888
They really did pick people from all
different schools for this, didn't they?

68
00:05:26,134 --> 00:05:28,565
It sure looks like it. That may be the case.

69
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:30,592
But this is still a lousy turnout.

70
00:05:30,634 --> 00:05:33,935
It's so much easier to doze off in
class when there are more people there.

71
00:05:34,201 --> 00:05:35,564
What's with the long faces?

72
00:05:35,589 --> 00:05:37,360
You all look like your puppies just died.

73
00:05:37,527 --> 00:05:39,775
Why did we come to this thing, anyway, Boss...?

74
00:05:40,029 --> 00:05:41,070
It's so lame.

75
00:05:41,991 --> 00:05:44,774
Well, we're here, so you might as
well quit your griping you got it?

76
00:05:44,806 --> 00:05:45,552
Yes, I'm sorry.

77
00:05:45,577 --> 00:05:46,302
I didn't hear you!

78
00:05:46,326 --> 00:05:46,730
Scary...

79
00:05:46,755 --> 00:05:48,050
They look like they're in high school.

80
00:05:48,075 --> 00:05:49,642
Quit staring! They'll notice us.

81
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:51,176
No, no problems here.

82
00:05:51,201 --> 00:05:52,346
Please, just take it easy.

83
00:05:53,068 --> 00:05:54,274
Yes... got it.

84
00:05:54,299 --> 00:05:55,745
Okay, kids, that's enough.

85
00:05:55,971 --> 00:05:57,318
Let's all get inside now.

86
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,599
Yeah? Who're you supposed to be?

87
00:06:00,754 --> 00:06:02,077
I'm your teacher for today.

88
00:06:02,178 --> 00:06:03,109
Our teacher?!

89
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:06,470
I'm Komoe Tsukuyomi and I teach the morning class here.

90
00:06:06,968 --> 00:06:10,387
If you want to smart off to me, I will
happily extend the lessons even longer.

91
00:06:16,551 --> 00:06:19,786
One thing is paramount if you wish
to further develop your abilities.

92
00:06:21,372 --> 00:06:23,814
And that's the achievement of Personal Reality.

93
00:06:24,537 --> 00:06:29,081
Today, we're going to go back to the basics
and really explore exactly what that phrase means.

94
00:06:29,586 --> 00:06:32,956
Personal Reality involves the
development of a reality unto oneself,

95
00:06:33,015 --> 00:06:35,668
separate from that which may be accepted as true reality.

96
00:06:36,161 --> 00:06:40,483
As we study this concept, we must also look at
the quantum theory and the uncertainty principle

97
00:06:40,508 --> 00:06:41,961
postulated by Heisenberg.

98
00:06:42,483 --> 00:06:47,236
We must study theoretical physics because Personal
Reality and quantum theory have something in common:

99
00:06:47,466 --> 00:06:48,929
both are rooted in probability.

100
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:04,819
Okay, unless anybody has questions,
that should conclude the morning lecture...

101
00:07:05,357 --> 00:07:09,609
I'm sure you'd all like a nice, long lunch break,
but please don't be late to the afternoon class.

102
00:07:09,634 --> 00:07:11,403
It's for your own good, I promise.

103
00:07:12,522 --> 00:07:13,596
Ugh.

104
00:07:13,799 --> 00:07:15,607
I thought lunch would never come...

105
00:07:16,043 --> 00:07:18,531
Hey... massage my back, would you?

106
00:07:19,543 --> 00:07:21,208
Do I have a choice in the matter?

107
00:07:22,949 --> 00:07:24,282
That feels so good!

108
00:07:24,528 --> 00:07:26,158
You're becoming an old lady.

109
00:07:26,431 --> 00:07:27,357
Oh, shut up.

110
00:07:27,816 --> 00:07:29,375
We've been here for so long.

111
00:07:29,476 --> 00:07:31,655
I can't believe the day's only halfway over.

112
00:07:31,982 --> 00:07:33,737
This is seriously draining.

113
00:07:34,023 --> 00:07:35,031
Yeah, it is...

114
00:07:35,711 --> 00:07:37,114
Oh, now that you mention it...

115
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:39,373
don't we have to go to physical training this afternoon?

116
00:07:39,398 --> 00:07:40,440
We sure do.

117
00:07:41,126 --> 00:07:44,559
Oh... and what's even worse you guys
know the teacher they put in charge of it?

118
00:07:44,718 --> 00:07:47,300
From what I hear, she normally does this with Antiskill.

119
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:48,410
Eh?!

120
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:49,477
That is bad...

121
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:52,233
I bet she's gonna make us run some really harsh drills.

122
00:07:52,258 --> 00:07:53,862
I wanna go home!

123
00:07:57,663 --> 00:08:00,288
Well... sitting around here's not gonna help anything...

124
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,952
We might as well eat while we still can.

125
00:08:03,899 --> 00:08:04,628
What is it?

126
00:08:05,172 --> 00:08:06,672
I forgot to bring lunch with me.

127
00:08:10,003 --> 00:08:11,712
Everyone else has the day off.

128
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:16,203
Hey, it's me...

129
00:08:16,536 --> 00:08:17,761
No, they're not open...

130
00:08:18,017 --> 00:08:19,564
I'm gonna go out and grab something.

131
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:21,310
Don't worry about it.

132
00:08:22,967 --> 00:08:23,710
Hey, Saten.

133
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,247
So... long time no see...

134
00:08:28,473 --> 00:08:29,557
Jufuku, remember?

135
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:31,623
Oh... uh... hi Jufuku...

136
00:08:32,214 --> 00:08:34,326
Are you taking the workshop this afternoon, too?

137
00:08:34,761 --> 00:08:35,572
Yeah, I am.

138
00:08:35,597 --> 00:08:37,431
Sorry, I didn't notice you.

139
00:08:37,815 --> 00:08:39,521
I didn't really want to be noticed...

140
00:08:39,831 --> 00:08:41,585
Have you forgotten my Dummy Check ability?

141
00:08:41,802 --> 00:08:44,505
It comes in handy when you don't
want people to realize you're there.

142
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:46,840
You made yourself disappear?

143
00:08:46,865 --> 00:08:49,890
No... My level isn't high enough to manage that...

144
00:08:50,366 --> 00:08:53,330
but I do have a knack for making things seem less present.

145
00:08:54,007 --> 00:08:55,523
Oh... I get it.

146
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:57,557
Uh... Saten?

147
00:08:57,612 --> 00:08:59,343
Huh? Yes? What is it?

148
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,753
I wanted to say thanks for always
answering the letters I wrote you...

149
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:04,216
I really appreciated it.

150
00:09:04,391 --> 00:09:05,683
Oh... sure...

151
00:09:05,924 --> 00:09:06,861
no problem...

152
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:08,608
I did promise I would.

153
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,254
But, uh...

154
00:09:10,227 --> 00:09:13,599
Well... it would mean a lot to me if
you would write the next letter first...

155
00:09:13,922 --> 00:09:14,623
maybe?

156
00:09:16,277 --> 00:09:18,235
Uh... Well...

157
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:19,891
if I get a chance...

158
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:24,524
It might sound silly, but I sleep with the postcards
you send me tucked under my pillow every night...

159
00:09:24,874 --> 00:09:27,948
I like feeling close to you,
even if it's only in my dreams.

160
00:09:28,187 --> 00:09:29,854
That's... very sweet.

161
00:09:29,963 --> 00:09:32,309
You know... I'm so glad I came today...

162
00:09:32,618 --> 00:09:35,796
I was really dreading coming to
this stupid "special" workshop...

163
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,775
But it turns out I was wrong, though.

164
00:09:38,103 --> 00:09:39,491
Since I got to see you.

165
00:09:44,797 --> 00:09:46,251
Hey... you... you know...

166
00:09:46,438 --> 00:09:49,875
um, if you feel like it, maybe we can eat lunch together.

167
00:09:49,986 --> 00:09:51,320
Oh... I can't...

168
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,023
I forgot to bring one, and the cafeteria's closed...

169
00:09:54,171 --> 00:09:56,397
So I'm gonna have to go out and pick something up.

170
00:09:56,851 --> 00:09:57,582
That's okay...

171
00:09:57,975 --> 00:10:00,465
I mean, I actually packed way more than I can eat today.

172
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:02,221
You're welcome to have some if you'd like.

173
00:10:02,329 --> 00:10:04,231
Oh... thanks, but...

174
00:10:12,322 --> 00:10:14,711
Wow! You're sure you don't mind?

175
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:15,592
Not at all.

176
00:10:16,055 --> 00:10:17,976
Please help yourself to whatever looks good.

177
00:10:18,032 --> 00:10:19,327
Okay, thanks a lot.

178
00:10:24,337 --> 00:10:26,239
You made this? It's delicious!

179
00:10:26,964 --> 00:10:29,240
You think so? I'm glad to hear it.

180
00:10:31,271 --> 00:10:31,958
You know...

181
00:10:33,764 --> 00:10:36,582
It felt really awkward sitting in that classroom...

182
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:40,135
almost like I should be ashamed or something.

183
00:10:40,842 --> 00:10:43,152
Why do you say that? We're all in the same boat.

184
00:10:43,357 --> 00:10:45,838
Well... That's kinda the point, isn't it?

185
00:10:46,684 --> 00:10:49,081
They've gathered together a certain type of people.

186
00:10:50,752 --> 00:10:52,828
I wonder if there will be more workshops...

187
00:10:53,133 --> 00:10:54,403
for people like us.

188
00:10:55,001 --> 00:10:55,522
Maybe...

189
00:10:56,484 --> 00:10:57,968
but even if there are more of them...

190
00:10:58,928 --> 00:11:00,592
There's nothing we can do about it.

191
00:11:06,928 --> 00:11:08,340
There's nothing we can do.

192
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:15,640
It's hot out here.

193
00:11:15,665 --> 00:11:17,733
I can't believe they're making us work out in this.

194
00:11:17,758 --> 00:11:19,152
Isn't this some kinda abuse?

195
00:11:19,177 --> 00:11:20,941
Can you do anything but complain?

196
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:23,808
You think whining's gonna make it any cooler? Huh?

197
00:11:24,324 --> 00:11:25,046
Sorry, Boss!

198
00:11:25,071 --> 00:11:26,524
Seriously scary.

199
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:29,162
What did I tell you earlier? Don't stare at them!

200
00:11:30,155 --> 00:11:31,681
Okay, look sharp, people...

201
00:11:32,252 --> 00:11:33,399
In case you haven't guessed,

202
00:11:33,424 --> 00:11:34,861
I'm your physical training teacher,

203
00:11:34,886 --> 00:11:35,875
Miss Yomikawa...

204
00:11:36,555 --> 00:11:37,679
Nice to meet you all.

205
00:11:38,726 --> 00:11:41,858
Nice to meet you too, Miss Yomikawa.

206
00:11:41,883 --> 00:11:43,105
All right, that's enough of that.

207
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:45,314
Why don't we get started with an endurance run?

208
00:11:46,467 --> 00:11:47,320
It's too hot!

209
00:11:47,344 --> 00:11:47,872
No way!

210
00:11:49,585 --> 00:11:51,170
Not up for testing your limits?

211
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:00,762
Slow down, Ruiko.

212
00:12:00,987 --> 00:12:02,445
You should be conserving your strength.

213
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:04,733
I don't get why we're even doing this in the first place.

214
00:12:04,758 --> 00:12:05,416
It's not fair.

215
00:12:05,614 --> 00:12:07,624
What's the point in making us run until we drop...?

216
00:12:07,973 --> 00:12:08,819
Torture?

217
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,169
Hey, you three!

218
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:13,949
Stop dragging your feet.

219
00:12:14,174 --> 00:12:15,588
I know you can go faster.

220
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:20,137
When you don't think you can run
any farther, then raise your hand.

221
00:12:20,941 --> 00:12:22,217
She's enjoying this.

222
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:23,609
Keep moving!

223
00:12:24,017 --> 00:12:26,582
Yomikawa runs her classes like a drill sergeant...

224
00:12:27,392 --> 00:12:28,979
Hang in there, kids. You can do it.

225
00:12:29,966 --> 00:12:31,166
Get through this...

226
00:12:31,706 --> 00:12:33,714
and you may overcome something greater.

227
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:34,772
Run!

228
00:12:40,939 --> 00:12:42,857
Get up! On your feet!

229
00:12:55,261 --> 00:12:56,454
I can't do it.

230
00:12:58,319 --> 00:12:59,052
I can't...

231
00:13:00,716 --> 00:13:01,504
You giving up?

232
00:13:01,529 --> 00:13:02,936
Yes, ma'am. I give up.

233
00:13:02,961 --> 00:13:04,651
All right, make this last lap a sprint.

234
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:05,406
Huh?!

235
00:13:05,605 --> 00:13:06,512
I said, sprint!

236
00:13:17,813 --> 00:13:18,866
Just hang in there.

237
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:20,628
You're almost done now.

238
00:13:23,182 --> 00:13:24,259
Okay, very good...

239
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:26,580
How about going for one more lap?

240
00:13:27,555 --> 00:13:28,908
I can't run anymore.

241
00:13:29,412 --> 00:13:29,908
Get up.

242
00:13:30,811 --> 00:13:32,387
Get up and give me one more lap.

243
00:13:32,765 --> 00:13:34,057
You call this training?

244
00:13:35,696 --> 00:13:36,789
I certainly do.

245
00:13:36,987 --> 00:13:39,736
How can you? All you're doing
is putting her through the ringer!

246
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:42,510
Why not go ahead and call this what it is...

247
00:13:42,535 --> 00:13:44,416
It's punishment! Admit it, lady!

248
00:13:44,441 --> 00:13:47,196
The whole point of this
so-called workshop is to punish us!

249
00:13:47,408 --> 00:13:48,533
It's nothing of the sort.

250
00:13:48,691 --> 00:13:51,932
Then why do you have us running
until we're too exhausted to move?

251
00:13:52,232 --> 00:13:54,581
The point is to teach you how to overcome your limits.

252
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:56,359
Look at him.

253
00:13:57,874 --> 00:13:59,465
He was the first one to raise his hand...

254
00:13:59,724 --> 00:14:00,718
yet he's still running.

255
00:14:01,732 --> 00:14:04,525
When you convince yourself you
can't do any more, you're finished...

256
00:14:05,149 --> 00:14:08,171
Even though you may still have some
strength left that you're just unaware of.

257
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:10,793
Her, for instance.

258
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:14,790
So sure she couldn't go one more
step. until she ran another lap...

259
00:14:15,137 --> 00:14:18,110
Where do you think the strength
to run the additional lap came from?

260
00:14:18,311 --> 00:14:20,661
The same applies to developing your abilities.

261
00:14:21,484 --> 00:14:25,118
What I wanted to teach you today is not
to decide so quickly what your limits are.

262
00:14:25,946 --> 00:14:27,224
Oh, please!

263
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:28,750
Don't give me that crap!

264
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:34,508
She's down! Are you okay, Boss?

265
00:14:34,606 --> 00:14:36,908
You think we won't go after you because you're a teacher?

266
00:14:37,347 --> 00:14:39,109
That will be all. Class dismissed.

267
00:14:39,205 --> 00:14:40,283
You're running away?

268
00:14:41,424 --> 00:14:42,667
Time's up for today.

269
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:50,543
Everybody hurry back inside!

270
00:15:03,462 --> 00:15:04,636
Hey, Ruiko!

271
00:15:05,202 --> 00:15:06,114
Come on! Hurry!

272
00:15:06,813 --> 00:15:08,195
Quick, before you get soaked.

273
00:15:12,409 --> 00:15:14,385
It should clear up by the time we're done here.

274
00:15:14,443 --> 00:15:15,448
Aww, man...

275
00:15:15,787 --> 00:15:18,984
after the last class, they're
gonna make us take an ability test...

276
00:15:19,226 --> 00:15:21,241
We know how that one's gonna turn out.

277
00:15:21,615 --> 00:15:23,869
"When you think you can't do any more, you're finished!"

278
00:15:23,893 --> 00:15:24,634
Dead on...

279
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,056
Always nice to hear another empty pep talk.

280
00:15:27,477 --> 00:15:28,160
You know...

281
00:15:28,758 --> 00:15:32,911
maybe that punk girl was right earlier and this
workshop doesn't have anything to do with education.

282
00:15:32,936 --> 00:15:34,398
Like I said: punishment.

283
00:15:34,678 --> 00:15:38,529
First we all slip into comas, and then
they force us to take these stupid classes...

284
00:15:38,656 --> 00:15:39,906
I wonder what'll be next...

285
00:15:40,133 --> 00:15:41,889
They could at least have been straight with us.

286
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:45,853
Why didn't they come out and say we're being
punished instead of pretending it's a workshop?

287
00:15:46,204 --> 00:15:47,023
I mean, come on...

288
00:15:47,153 --> 00:15:48,866
was what we did even that wrong?

289
00:15:49,731 --> 00:15:53,655
Who wouldn't want to level up so easily? In
this world, you gotta take every advantage you get.

290
00:15:53,866 --> 00:15:55,444
Yeah, you've got a point there.

291
00:15:57,843 --> 00:15:59,093
It's not right to cheat.

292
00:16:00,732 --> 00:16:01,990
Um... Ruiko...?

293
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:05,406
We all cheated, so it's only natural
that we're being punished for it.

294
00:16:19,667 --> 00:16:21,332
My, aren't you a good little girl?

295
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:30,038
You idiot!

296
00:16:30,178 --> 00:16:31,832
Why did you challenge her like that?

297
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:33,389
Aren't you scared of her?

298
00:16:33,685 --> 00:16:35,954
Yes... Terrified, actually...

299
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:37,863
Her eyes are like daggers.

300
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:40,355
Even so... you didn't back down one bit!

301
00:16:40,787 --> 00:16:42,779
I swear I could see sparks when their eyes met.

302
00:16:42,804 --> 00:16:43,471
Me, too!

303
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:45,354
Then there was that popping sound!

304
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:46,858
I think that was just thunder, guys.

305
00:16:46,883 --> 00:16:47,873
I know what I heard.

306
00:16:47,921 --> 00:16:50,342
Sparks or not, what Ruiko said was right.

307
00:16:50,531 --> 00:16:51,764
It was wrong of us to cheat.

308
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,883
It was.

309
00:17:03,505 --> 00:17:06,352
It appears that some of you may
have jumped to the wrong conclusion.

310
00:17:06,897 --> 00:17:09,444
So before we continue, I want to clarify something.

311
00:17:10,316 --> 00:17:15,027
Please understand this workshop was not intended as
a punishment for students who used the Level Upper.

312
00:17:15,978 --> 00:17:18,311
Certainly, your actions were far from laudable.

313
00:17:18,432 --> 00:17:23,243
It would've been better had you resisted the
temptation to use that device to augment your abilities.

314
00:17:23,758 --> 00:17:28,780
However... we do not want you to feel a disproportionate
sense of shame or remorse for having done so...

315
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:33,064
As far as punishment goes, I'd say
slipping into a coma should suffice...

316
00:17:33,329 --> 00:17:35,892
That's a far more harrowing experience than a workshop.

317
00:17:36,497 --> 00:17:38,966
You've already paid for your transgressions the hard way.

318
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:41,135
So, instead of feeling guilty or bitter,

319
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:43,614
why not make the most of all you've gone through?

320
00:17:44,638 --> 00:17:47,898
The Level Upper gave you a taste of
power that you've never had before.

321
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:50,487
However, that power didn't come from some device.

322
00:17:50,568 --> 00:17:52,823
It was already inside you, waiting to come out.

323
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:55,818
As I'm sure my friend Miss Yomikawa would tell you...

324
00:17:56,109 --> 00:17:58,105
"You convinced yourselves you'd reached your limits,

325
00:17:58,130 --> 00:17:59,995
but... you overcame them."

326
00:18:00,425 --> 00:18:01,120
Okay then.

327
00:18:01,267 --> 00:18:04,009
With that said, we'll begin
the last class of the workshop.

328
00:18:04,122 --> 00:18:06,186
I want you to think about using the Level Upper.

329
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:08,617
Close your eyes if it will help you focus.

330
00:18:09,144 --> 00:18:11,186
Concentrate on the time you used your power.

331
00:18:11,311 --> 00:18:12,582
As clearly as you can.

332
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,828
Remember every aspect of how it felt.

333
00:18:16,067 --> 00:18:19,351
Now, I want each of you to try to
achieve your own Personal Reality...

334
00:18:19,813 --> 00:18:22,933
or at least reinforce the footholds
that you already have in place.

335
00:18:31,512 --> 00:18:32,683
A new reality...

336
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:34,556
my own reality...

337
00:18:35,233 --> 00:18:35,939
Concentrate.

338
00:18:37,868 --> 00:18:38,709
So, anyway...

339
00:18:38,734 --> 00:18:41,277
he told me to study up on "Personal Reality,"

340
00:18:41,421 --> 00:18:43,495
but I just don't get the concept, you know?

341
00:18:43,762 --> 00:18:46,489
Maybe it has something to do
with the power of our own belief...

342
00:18:46,572 --> 00:18:49,041
The way we shape the assumptions we make about the world.

343
00:18:49,654 --> 00:18:50,582
I'm sorry...

344
00:18:50,883 --> 00:18:52,265
I came so close...

345
00:18:52,602 --> 00:18:56,652
So close to losing something far more
important to me than some stupid ability.

346
00:18:57,869 --> 00:18:58,861
I couldn't take it...

347
00:18:59,457 --> 00:19:01,783
I was so tired of not having any power.

348
00:19:03,055 --> 00:19:06,956
And finally, it didn't matter anymore
what lengths I had to go to to get it.

349
00:19:07,224 --> 00:19:08,148
I understand.

350
00:19:08,516 --> 00:19:09,951
But this doesn't have to be it.

351
00:19:10,127 --> 00:19:12,358
You'll be fine, Saten... I know you.

352
00:19:12,383 --> 00:19:14,059
You're too stubborn to give up easily.

353
00:19:14,967 --> 00:19:17,387
Don't stay here and let yourself be defeated.

354
00:19:18,229 --> 00:19:19,755
You are not defective.

355
00:19:19,832 --> 00:19:21,186
There's nothing wrong with you.

356
00:19:21,868 --> 00:19:23,251
So... don't give up!

357
00:19:37,823 --> 00:19:38,851
Okay, everyone!

358
00:19:39,638 --> 00:19:42,169
We're going to finish up the
day with a quick ability test.

359
00:19:42,629 --> 00:19:45,305
Go ahead and pack up your stuff and follow us, please.

360
00:19:51,004 --> 00:19:53,298
So, how did you guys do on the test?

361
00:19:53,535 --> 00:19:55,173
My numbers were actually up a little.

362
00:19:55,423 --> 00:19:56,802
No way! Mine, too!

363
00:19:57,167 --> 00:19:59,154
But our levels are still the same as ever.

364
00:20:00,995 --> 00:20:04,591
I know...! Let's go do something
to celebrate the workshop being over.

365
00:20:04,674 --> 00:20:05,534
Good idea.

366
00:20:05,565 --> 00:20:07,417
Hey... you coming along Ruiko?

367
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:10,213
Oh... I don't know. Let me think.

368
00:20:11,804 --> 00:20:13,054
No... sorry...

369
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,289
Go ahead without me.

370
00:20:15,265 --> 00:20:17,030
I've got something I need to take care of.

371
00:20:22,823 --> 00:20:24,721
Like I thought. It's from Jufuku.

372
00:20:25,692 --> 00:20:28,645
I'm so glad we got to spend
time together again today, Saten...

373
00:20:28,967 --> 00:20:30,440
It was really inspiring.

374
00:20:31,426 --> 00:20:34,183
Seeing you go lap after lap in the endurance run...

375
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:39,323
And the way you stood your ground with that scary
high-school girl when everybody else was afraid to...

376
00:20:42,318 --> 00:20:44,725
Watching you be brave gave me more courage.

377
00:20:45,624 --> 00:20:47,650
I'm gonna try to learn from your example...

378
00:20:48,155 --> 00:20:52,235
I'll stop moping about things I can't
change and be strong like you, instead.

379
00:20:53,188 --> 00:20:54,751
I don't think I'm all that strong.

380
00:20:57,757 --> 00:20:59,766
Of course I wasn't going to do that well...

381
00:21:00,524 --> 00:21:01,150
For now...

382
00:21:01,692 --> 00:21:03,039
I'll just keep trying.

383
00:21:05,174 --> 00:21:07,360
Oh... hey... how's it going?

384
00:21:07,668 --> 00:21:08,341
Pretty good.

385
00:21:15,012 --> 00:21:17,778
All right! Done for the day. It's time to go home.

386
00:21:19,783 --> 00:21:21,074
All finished, Saten?

387
00:21:21,349 --> 00:21:23,911
We wanted to come by and pick you up. How did it go?

388
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:25,040
What was the hold up?

389
00:21:25,169 --> 00:21:29,147
You took so long coming out of there, we
thought you'd already left and headed for home.

390
00:21:29,456 --> 00:21:34,039
You should have seen it, Saten. Without you, we
weren't able to decide on a single thing to do.

391
00:21:36,736 --> 00:21:39,203
Yeah? Then what've you been up to all this time?

392
00:21:39,561 --> 00:21:40,421
So, Saten...

393
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:42,172
how does going to the movies sound?

394
00:21:42,197 --> 00:21:43,350
Huh? Forget that.

395
00:21:43,423 --> 00:21:46,124
They're having some kind of
event on the roof at Seventh Mist...

396
00:21:46,149 --> 00:21:47,392
Doesn't that sound fun?

397
00:21:47,417 --> 00:21:48,274
Well, I...

398
00:21:48,299 --> 00:21:50,591
Do you really want to see Gekota that badly?

399
00:21:50,616 --> 00:21:52,234
I told you, that isn't it!

400
00:21:52,539 --> 00:21:55,102
So, you see, we've been split between two ideas.

401
00:21:55,307 --> 00:21:57,820
We spent the whole day at the restaurant talking it over.

402
00:21:58,339 --> 00:22:00,258
And... you want me to pick?

403
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:03,416
It's the movie, right?

404
00:22:03,441 --> 00:22:04,913
Hey, Kuroko! No fair!

405
00:22:05,367 --> 00:22:07,478
Okay! I say we go to the pool!

406
00:22:07,689 --> 00:22:08,162
Eh?!

407
00:22:08,502 --> 00:22:10,358
But that wasn't one of the options.

408
00:22:10,383 --> 00:22:12,509
All right then. Why don't you decide Uiharu?

409
00:22:12,534 --> 00:22:12,751
Huh?

410
00:22:12,776 --> 00:22:13,725
Seventh Mist, right?

411
00:22:13,758 --> 00:22:14,868
No, the pool!

412
00:23:30,441 --> 00:23:33,236
What? Armed gunmen are hunting down Espers?

413
00:23:33,261 --> 00:23:35,351
This is the work of the gang known as Skill Out.

414
00:23:35,549 --> 00:23:36,737
What should we do, Konori?

415
00:23:37,139 --> 00:23:37,649
Konori...

416
00:23:37,948 --> 00:23:38,888
did you hear me?
