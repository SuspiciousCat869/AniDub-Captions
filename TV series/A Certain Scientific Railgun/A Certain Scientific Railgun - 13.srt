1
00:00:05,651 --> 00:00:06,698
Ugh...

2
00:00:06,934 --> 00:00:08,634
I'm so sick of this heat.

3
00:00:09,395 --> 00:00:12,074
It isn't even pleasant to eat outside anymore.

4
00:00:12,615 --> 00:00:14,028
Yeah, I know what you mean.

5
00:00:14,501 --> 00:00:17,578
But at least we have that really
strong sunblock to put on, right?

6
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,535
You did put the sunblock on
before coming outside, right, Sissy?

7
00:00:22,778 --> 00:00:23,998
Huh...? Why would I?

8
00:00:24,078 --> 00:00:26,032
Are you a dermatological idiot?

9
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:28,360
Ultraviolet rays are the skin's enemy.

10
00:00:28,487 --> 00:00:31,784
You don't want your beautiful, creamy
white skin covered in freckles, do you?

11
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,281
But we won't let that happen, now will we?

12
00:00:34,387 --> 00:00:36,707
Just hold still while I rub this
over every last inch of your body.

13
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:37,432
Uh, no thanks.

14
00:00:38,177 --> 00:00:41,610
Come on, there's no need to be shy,
Sissy. I only want to look after your health.

15
00:00:41,635 --> 00:00:42,804
Koroko, quit it!

16
00:00:43,068 --> 00:00:43,314
Knock it off!

17
00:00:43,338 --> 00:00:43,812
Shirai?

18
00:00:45,164 --> 00:00:46,529
Oh, hi there, Wannai.

19
00:00:46,726 --> 00:00:47,893
And Awatsuki, too...

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,696
What's up?

21
00:00:49,217 --> 00:00:51,288
Actually, we wanted to ask you a favor.

22
00:02:25,151 --> 00:02:26,460
Swimsuit modeling?

23
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:30,352
Yes! The swim club is involved
with this swimsuit manufacturer.

24
00:02:30,585 --> 00:02:32,586
They've been insisting we do this for them.

25
00:02:32,765 --> 00:02:35,771
Apparently, it'll be in the
upcoming issue of their web catalog.

26
00:02:36,078 --> 00:02:39,092
The older girls in the club are
all busy competing in a swim meet...

27
00:02:39,286 --> 00:02:41,929
which means we're the only ones available to participate.

28
00:02:44,508 --> 00:02:47,432
This is perfect! We have to help them out, Sissy.

29
00:02:47,818 --> 00:02:48,521
Hmm...

30
00:02:48,798 --> 00:02:50,825
Me wearing a swimsuit and modeling?

31
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:52,850
It doesn't sound like something I'd be good at...

32
00:02:53,209 --> 00:02:54,455
I don't know...

33
00:02:55,395 --> 00:02:57,168
Of course. We totally understand.

34
00:02:57,251 --> 00:02:58,096
Thanks, I'm sorry.

35
00:02:58,121 --> 00:02:59,527
I thought better of you than this!

36
00:03:00,081 --> 00:03:02,657
These poor girls are in desperate need of our assistance.

37
00:03:02,924 --> 00:03:04,882
Yet you refuse to volunteer your time?

38
00:03:04,907 --> 00:03:06,115
How uncharitable!

39
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:08,378
I'm tearing up... it's so tragic!

40
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,274
Hey! You wanna chip in?

41
00:03:17,845 --> 00:03:20,849
All right. If you don't think I'll
be too bad at it, I'll help you out.

42
00:03:20,874 --> 00:03:22,360
That's the selfless Sissy I know!

43
00:03:22,385 --> 00:03:23,241
I'm so glad!

44
00:03:23,266 --> 00:03:25,228
Yes, thank you! We really appreciate it!

45
00:03:26,026 --> 00:03:26,987
Excellent!

46
00:03:27,068 --> 00:03:30,033
I get to spend a whole day with Sissy in a swimsuit!

47
00:03:30,425 --> 00:03:33,340
I gonna have to pick out a really sexy bikini to model...!

48
00:03:33,372 --> 00:03:35,380
Yes! I'll have her salivating!

49
00:03:36,901 --> 00:03:38,776
I know there are dirty thoughts going through your head.

50
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,522
I give! I give! I give! I give! I give!

51
00:03:47,288 --> 00:03:49,191
I didn't know it was such a big business!

52
00:03:49,418 --> 00:03:51,960
It's exciting and intimidating all at the same time!

53
00:03:52,097 --> 00:03:53,240
Uiharu!

54
00:03:53,265 --> 00:03:56,133
It's great that you were able to get
your friends to come along, thanks again!

55
00:03:56,568 --> 00:04:00,288
It was no problem. With something like
this, the more the merrier, don't ya think?

56
00:04:00,335 --> 00:04:03,876
Eh, so after seeing us, are you sure
you want us to play swimsuit models?

57
00:04:03,901 --> 00:04:04,926
Don't worry so much.

58
00:04:04,951 --> 00:04:06,651
Modern fashion designers have come up with

59
00:04:06,735 --> 00:04:10,683
all sorts of ways to make even underdeveloped
bodies look more appealing to the eye.

60
00:04:11,026 --> 00:04:12,881
Thank you for your support, Shirai.

61
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:15,405
Sorry to keep you waiting.

62
00:04:17,743 --> 00:04:18,395
Who is she?

63
00:04:18,862 --> 00:04:21,016
She's the manufacturer's general manager.

64
00:04:21,286 --> 00:04:22,592
Thanks for coming today.

65
00:04:22,617 --> 00:04:23,743
It's gonna be great...

66
00:04:23,779 --> 00:04:25,936
Uh... weren't there two more coming?

67
00:04:25,961 --> 00:04:26,864
More models?

68
00:04:27,111 --> 00:04:28,486
Well, hello, Shirai.

69
00:04:28,511 --> 00:04:30,430
Ugh... I know that voice.

70
00:04:30,455 --> 00:04:32,585
Oh, my, look at all the people who are with you!

71
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:35,467
Is this a social studies field
trip for school, or something?

72
00:04:36,104 --> 00:04:37,416
Oh, hi there, Kongo.

73
00:04:37,441 --> 00:04:38,720
And Konori's here, too!

74
00:04:39,014 --> 00:04:40,341
What do you have to say for yourself?

75
00:04:40,366 --> 00:04:41,706
Why are you wearing that outfit?

76
00:04:42,026 --> 00:04:45,479
The school rule dictates that we
wear our uniforms even on days off.

77
00:04:45,504 --> 00:04:46,754
Or have you forgotten that?

78
00:04:47,055 --> 00:04:50,834
For this afternoon at least, I am no
mere student of Tokiwadai Middle School.

79
00:04:51,164 --> 00:04:52,623
I am here as a model...

80
00:04:52,675 --> 00:04:54,323
Naturally, I dressed as such.

81
00:04:54,633 --> 00:04:55,355
A model?

82
00:04:55,918 --> 00:04:57,148
They asked you, too?

83
00:04:57,404 --> 00:04:59,707
Huh? You don't mean... are you?

84
00:05:00,144 --> 00:05:02,878
Did you come for the swimsuit modeling as well, Konori?

85
00:05:03,082 --> 00:05:07,614
Yeah. I ran into a classmate at the gym, and
she asked me if I'd be willing to come today...

86
00:05:08,042 --> 00:05:09,138
What about you guys?

87
00:05:09,543 --> 00:05:12,611
We've got some friends in the swim
club, and they asked us to help out.

88
00:05:13,936 --> 00:05:17,171
It's obvious that none of you have
done anything like this before...

89
00:05:17,255 --> 00:05:19,682
I'd be delighted to give you a pointer or two.

90
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,169
From a pro! I've been modeling
ever since I was a little girl.

91
00:05:25,864 --> 00:05:28,504
The thunderous applause echoing off all the walls...

92
00:05:28,574 --> 00:05:30,583
the cheers screaming my name!

93
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:35,063
I can still hear their ardent admiration, even now!

94
00:05:37,985 --> 00:05:41,358
Give me a break. I bet the only
person cheering for you was your mother.

95
00:05:41,962 --> 00:05:46,085
Now, shall we get down to business?
Will you show me to the changing rooms?

96
00:05:46,133 --> 00:05:47,119
Uh... sure...

97
00:05:47,476 --> 00:05:48,158
Right this way.

98
00:05:48,183 --> 00:05:49,636
I must be dressed in a suit that flatters my curves.

99
00:05:49,661 --> 00:05:51,651
Is that girl an acquaintance of yours?

100
00:05:51,676 --> 00:05:54,668
She's more like somebody I wish I wasn't acquainted with.

101
00:05:56,905 --> 00:06:00,670
All right! Everybody please
choose whichever swimsuit you prefer.

102
00:06:00,882 --> 00:06:02,004
Okay!

103
00:06:03,659 --> 00:06:05,637
Hey, look... what do you think of this?

104
00:06:05,841 --> 00:06:07,957
Wow! that's a really pretty one.

105
00:06:08,131 --> 00:06:10,261
Oh! This one's really cute.

106
00:06:10,313 --> 00:06:12,335
I think I found one I like, too.

107
00:06:12,682 --> 00:06:15,472
Hmm... This doesn't look that great...

108
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:19,022
and I don't care for this one... Hmm...

109
00:06:19,058 --> 00:06:20,827
Haven't you decided on a suit yet?

110
00:06:21,482 --> 00:06:23,393
It seems like you could use some tutoring.

111
00:06:23,418 --> 00:06:25,634
Why don't you allow me to select one for you?

112
00:06:25,659 --> 00:06:27,159
I don't need your help, thanks.

113
00:06:27,184 --> 00:06:29,668
Halter-top suits are best for those with a nice bust...

114
00:06:29,693 --> 00:06:34,000
and then there are triangle-top bikinis, which
always work well, whether you have the goods or not.

115
00:06:34,025 --> 00:06:35,971
I said no thanks. Now go away.

116
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,125
It's obvious which one you'll need.

117
00:06:39,013 --> 00:06:40,490
You have my sympathy.

118
00:06:41,163 --> 00:06:45,107
I look forward to sitting you down and having
a nice, long chat one of these days, Kongo.

119
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:57,406
Wow, look what Misaka found.

120
00:06:57,431 --> 00:06:58,343
It's so cute!

121
00:06:58,943 --> 00:07:01,737
Oh, yeah. Frills and polka-dots work so well together.

122
00:07:02,411 --> 00:07:03,742
No, you've got it wrong...

123
00:07:03,806 --> 00:07:05,599
I don't want to wear this one or anything...

124
00:07:05,731 --> 00:07:09,944
I'd love to see you in that one! It's
perfect. I know it'll look adorable on you!

125
00:07:10,254 --> 00:07:13,193
I agree! What's the harm in trying it on?

126
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:14,233
I don't know...

127
00:07:14,284 --> 00:07:15,719
I don't think it's the right fit.

128
00:07:15,837 --> 00:07:17,611
Don't be like that. Give it a chance!

129
00:07:17,794 --> 00:07:18,809
It'll look great.

130
00:07:18,834 --> 00:07:19,826
No doubt in my mind!

131
00:07:20,797 --> 00:07:21,866
You really think so...?

132
00:07:22,249 --> 00:07:24,396
Well, if you guys insist, I'll give it a shot.

133
00:07:24,421 --> 00:07:28,137
Oh, nice... I take it you prefer
designs that look more child-like, Misaka?

134
00:07:30,155 --> 00:07:32,665
No! Of course I don't. I was just browsing...

135
00:07:32,887 --> 00:07:34,437
Here... this is what I want...

136
00:07:34,462 --> 00:07:36,368
I'll just take it over here and try it on.

137
00:07:39,985 --> 00:07:42,953
Um... what's wrong...? Was it something that I said?

138
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:48,472
Why do I have to be so embarrassed about the stuff I like?

139
00:07:58,077 --> 00:08:01,163
I... I feel practically naked wearing this thing.

140
00:08:01,188 --> 00:08:02,521
We're all girls here, Uiharu.

141
00:08:02,546 --> 00:08:03,796
There's nothing to be shy about.

142
00:08:03,985 --> 00:08:05,357
Plus that looks great on you!

143
00:08:06,103 --> 00:08:07,153
It does? Really?

144
00:08:07,287 --> 00:08:10,164
A bikini divides the eyeline between top and bottom...

145
00:08:10,371 --> 00:08:13,162
but a one-piece shows off a woman's entire figure...

146
00:08:13,373 --> 00:08:15,639
so they only flatter truly slender people.

147
00:08:15,881 --> 00:08:18,093
Oh... Is that swim club knowledge?

148
00:08:18,118 --> 00:08:20,874
Do you have any other pointers
for picking out a suit to wear?

149
00:08:21,485 --> 00:08:22,622
Well, let me think...

150
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,210
sarongs are an option...

151
00:08:24,294 --> 00:08:25,877
they are, of course, fashionable...

152
00:08:26,119 --> 00:08:28,453
and they're also useful for covering the lower body.

153
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,874
It's not like I was trying to hide anything.

154
00:08:32,899 --> 00:08:34,151
I just thought it was cute!

155
00:08:34,254 --> 00:08:35,653
Sorry for taking so long.

156
00:08:39,697 --> 00:08:43,791
I am a little disappointed that all the
designs they had were so tame like this.

157
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:47,841
But given that these are off-the-rack
swimsuits, what more can a girl expect?

158
00:08:49,516 --> 00:08:50,932
I don't know what to say.

159
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,868
We probably shouldn't be surprised.

160
00:08:53,031 --> 00:08:55,460
Uh... individuality's important in a model.

161
00:08:55,527 --> 00:08:56,682
It sure is.

162
00:08:56,707 --> 00:08:59,668
Modest as it is, I'm sure this
must be driving you crazy, Sissy.

163
00:08:59,693 --> 00:09:02,291
I know it'll be difficult, but please, try to resist!

164
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:04,644
I don't think I'm gonna have a hard time with that.

165
00:09:05,057 --> 00:09:06,599
Oh, look at you girls...

166
00:09:06,695 --> 00:09:08,203
Is that all you're working with?

167
00:09:11,439 --> 00:09:13,630
Well, what do you think? Impressive, huh...?

168
00:09:14,032 --> 00:09:17,291
I'm working the "sexy and exotic"
angle. I expect rave reviews.

169
00:09:17,316 --> 00:09:19,660
It's the ultimate swimsuit experience for the audience.

170
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:21,313
That's a snake!

171
00:09:21,338 --> 00:09:22,208
It's not so scary, I think it's cute!

172
00:09:22,233 --> 00:09:23,750
Her name is Ecaterina.

173
00:09:23,775 --> 00:09:25,689
Oh, look at that. What a pretty python.

174
00:09:25,714 --> 00:09:28,350
You do realize it's a snake not a dog, Don't you?

175
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:30,193
Would you hurry up and put that away already?!

176
00:09:30,615 --> 00:09:31,433
Oh, why?

177
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:33,571
Don't you want to play with this little cutie?

178
00:09:36,055 --> 00:09:38,210
What do you think, Shirai. Surely you're not scared.

179
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:39,490
What? Me?

180
00:09:39,515 --> 00:09:41,435
I think it's just a tasteless stage prop.

181
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:47,250
It's a little bit tight...

182
00:09:47,674 --> 00:09:48,722
but it's all they had...

183
00:09:48,914 --> 00:09:50,581
They don't carry larger sizes.

184
00:09:53,748 --> 00:09:54,720
Oh, wow!

185
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:01,848
It's nothing but an empty room.

186
00:10:02,262 --> 00:10:04,699
This is where we're going to be shooting? It's so bare.

187
00:10:12,901 --> 00:10:16,886
This high... tech studio digitally
creates any number of different settings.

188
00:10:20,123 --> 00:10:22,782
Wow, that's amazing! I can even touch it.

189
00:10:22,835 --> 00:10:25,268
It's the latest in Academy City technology.

190
00:10:26,203 --> 00:10:30,161
Oh... I was just wondering-is the
person shooting us going to be a man?

191
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:32,810
Yeah... now that you mention it, that's a good question.

192
00:10:33,029 --> 00:10:35,653
Even if he was a professional, it would still be kinda...

193
00:10:35,847 --> 00:10:38,180
you know? I can't stand amateurs...

194
00:10:38,205 --> 00:10:41,841
Don't you people get it? The whole point
of modeling is to be seen at your sexiest.

195
00:10:42,143 --> 00:10:43,820
All the photography is automated.

196
00:10:44,834 --> 00:10:48,587
The camera will never be inside your field
of view, so you don't have to worry about it.

197
00:10:48,663 --> 00:10:50,017
Just act naturally, okay?

198
00:11:12,067 --> 00:11:15,631
She said to act naturally and
nothing about that looks natural to me.

199
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:18,316
Come on, Sissy. We need to play our parts, too.

200
00:11:18,901 --> 00:11:19,793
What parts do you mean?

201
00:11:19,818 --> 00:11:20,747
Oh, you know...

202
00:11:20,851 --> 00:11:23,607
You're the sexy beach babe I apply suntan lotion to.

203
00:11:23,712 --> 00:11:25,537
Not this again! I said no!

204
00:11:25,562 --> 00:11:28,360
Aww! Just a little, please? You'll like it!

205
00:11:28,466 --> 00:11:29,423
Go away!

206
00:11:29,536 --> 00:11:30,493
Rub... a... dub... dub!

207
00:11:30,517 --> 00:11:30,854
No, no, no!

208
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:33,235
I get it now. That's totally natural for them.

209
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:35,302
Yeah, that's Misaka for you...

210
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:37,027
She always sets a great example.

211
00:11:37,361 --> 00:11:39,370
What do you guys think? Should we follow her cue?

212
00:11:39,395 --> 00:11:40,037
Yeah!

213
00:12:01,034 --> 00:12:02,500
W... where are we now?

214
00:12:03,015 --> 00:12:05,248
Wherever it is, it's incredibly cold.

215
00:12:05,337 --> 00:12:09,668
When the scenery changes in the room, the
temperature changes, too? That is high-tech.

216
00:12:09,693 --> 00:12:11,860
I think this may be taking it a little far.

217
00:12:11,943 --> 00:12:15,163
We're supposed to be relaxed and
natural in the middle of a blizzard?

218
00:12:15,188 --> 00:12:16,866
That's what makes a real model...

219
00:12:17,164 --> 00:12:19,064
Whatever happens, you get the job done.

220
00:12:21,565 --> 00:12:23,857
Serves you right for being such a show-off.

221
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:31,324
Ow! Hot!!

222
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,373
From too cold to too warm.

223
00:12:33,578 --> 00:12:34,769
Way, way too warm.

224
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:37,181
Why'd they program in such extremes?

225
00:12:37,206 --> 00:12:38,219
Water! Water!

226
00:12:41,532 --> 00:12:42,865
Not this much water!

227
00:12:43,107 --> 00:12:45,501
Like I said, what's with all the extreme weather?

228
00:12:45,552 --> 00:12:48,768
If they want to put us on a boat,
can't they at least make it comfortable?

229
00:12:54,144 --> 00:12:56,165
Not bad...! A prize barracuda!

230
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:58,585
Sorry... I think that's just a really big tuna.

231
00:12:58,610 --> 00:12:59,454
Is not!

232
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:02,092
Maybe you should let her have her fantasy...

233
00:13:02,157 --> 00:13:05,049
I'm sure she doesn't want
credit for something she didn't do.

234
00:13:06,614 --> 00:13:08,201
Oh, I guess we're off the boat.

235
00:13:08,226 --> 00:13:10,117
Wow... the stars are beautiful...!

236
00:13:10,506 --> 00:13:11,577
And over there!

237
00:13:11,955 --> 00:13:13,644
Looks a lot like the Earth!

238
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:14,576
Huh?

239
00:13:16,742 --> 00:13:18,190
Great, we're on the moon, now?!

240
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:19,812
Well, at least it's pretty.

241
00:13:20,376 --> 00:13:21,526
Yeah. Very pretty.

242
00:13:22,347 --> 00:13:23,541
Hey, you guys, look!

243
00:13:23,649 --> 00:13:24,823
What's that over there?

244
00:13:39,948 --> 00:13:41,767
I'm sorry. Please hold on a moment...

245
00:13:41,957 --> 00:13:44,195
We need to make some adjustments and change the scene.

246
00:13:44,944 --> 00:13:46,903
Great. What are we in for this time?

247
00:13:51,584 --> 00:13:52,529
A campsite?

248
00:13:53,395 --> 00:13:54,299
I'm sorry.

249
00:13:54,857 --> 00:13:58,359
We're experiencing some technical
difficulties with the cameras...

250
00:13:58,812 --> 00:14:00,735
We should have it taken care of soon...

251
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,768
In the meantime, why don't you take a short break?

252
00:14:05,965 --> 00:14:07,241
So, what do we do now?

253
00:14:07,357 --> 00:14:09,419
Oh, by the way, the food there is real.

254
00:14:09,651 --> 00:14:11,693
Feel free to cook something up if you want to.

255
00:14:11,926 --> 00:14:13,718
Cook something up using this stuff?

256
00:14:14,003 --> 00:14:14,939
What should we make?

257
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,657
With the number of people and the ingredients we have...

258
00:14:19,604 --> 00:14:21,026
We need to make some curry!

259
00:14:22,943 --> 00:14:25,642
Some of us can work on the
curry, and the rest can do rice.

260
00:14:25,667 --> 00:14:26,896
I'll be on team curry!

261
00:14:27,247 --> 00:14:28,643
Yeah, me too, please.

262
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:30,600
All right. Why don't I take the rice.

263
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:32,583
If you're making rice, Sissy, that's what I'm doing!

264
00:14:32,608 --> 00:14:33,674
Ugh... please...

265
00:14:33,699 --> 00:14:36,121
curry is such a boorish, unsophisticated food.

266
00:14:37,448 --> 00:14:39,124
What are you talking about? It's delicious.

267
00:14:39,288 --> 00:14:40,951
You really don't like curry?

268
00:14:41,098 --> 00:14:43,446
I'm betting you just have no idea how to make it.

269
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:45,375
Please! Don't be ridiculous!

270
00:14:45,608 --> 00:14:47,206
I have a recipe for the best curry.

271
00:14:47,231 --> 00:14:50,000
It's been passed down through
the Kongo family for generations!

272
00:14:50,025 --> 00:14:52,010
Oh? What kind of curry is it?

273
00:14:53,129 --> 00:14:55,673
An authentic family recipe? I'd love to try it!

274
00:14:55,698 --> 00:14:57,032
Yes, please make it for us!

275
00:14:57,057 --> 00:15:01,863
Well, since I'm stuck here anyway, I suppose I can
make do with whatever plebeian curry dish you all prefer.

276
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:03,985
We can make a normal curry and your dish.

277
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:05,424
We've got lots to work with.

278
00:15:05,891 --> 00:15:07,265
That's a great idea!

279
00:15:07,499 --> 00:15:09,271
Okay let's do it! Yeah?!

280
00:15:09,373 --> 00:15:09,810
Well...

281
00:15:09,988 --> 00:15:11,708
if you insist, I guess we can.

282
00:15:12,224 --> 00:15:13,288
Hooray!

283
00:15:13,718 --> 00:15:15,404
All right... everything's settled then...

284
00:15:15,429 --> 00:15:16,928
We'll go and get the rice started.

285
00:15:17,544 --> 00:15:18,079
Right!

286
00:15:19,653 --> 00:15:21,471
Be ready for something amazing!

287
00:15:24,067 --> 00:15:25,692
Um, excuse me, Kongo...

288
00:15:25,776 --> 00:15:26,818
Oh...! Yes?

289
00:15:26,997 --> 00:15:29,891
Would you mind if we joined you?
We'd love to see how it's done.

290
00:15:31,619 --> 00:15:33,762
Uh... certainly, if that's what you want.

291
00:15:34,528 --> 00:15:36,581
Shall we get started cooking, ladies?

292
00:15:36,985 --> 00:15:38,409
First... why don't we...

293
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:40,061
uh... peel these onions?

294
00:15:40,086 --> 00:15:40,768
Sure!

295
00:15:45,722 --> 00:15:46,789
Stupid thing.

296
00:15:49,311 --> 00:15:50,220
It's broken?

297
00:15:50,332 --> 00:15:51,733
This isn't working, either.

298
00:15:53,607 --> 00:15:54,344
I know!

299
00:15:58,155 --> 00:16:00,293
This is what I call induction cooking!

300
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,171
Don't talk to me.

301
00:16:01,196 --> 00:16:03,569
I have to concentrate, or it's gonna boil over.

302
00:16:04,094 --> 00:16:05,514
Could you do this one, too?

303
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:07,482
What? Don't tell me there's more!

304
00:16:10,332 --> 00:16:12,898
You get a lot less onion after all that peeling, huh?

305
00:16:13,359 --> 00:16:15,043
So, what are we supposed to do with this?

306
00:16:15,068 --> 00:16:16,775
Oh... well, we, uh...

307
00:16:20,182 --> 00:16:22,664
That's what those things on the side of the plate are!

308
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:26,174
Out of the whole entire onion
they only use this one tiny part?

309
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:28,860
It must be a precious ingredient for all that work.

310
00:16:28,885 --> 00:16:30,918
Well... feel like you're learning some things?

311
00:16:31,196 --> 00:16:31,870
Yes!

312
00:16:32,634 --> 00:16:33,245
Thanks...

313
00:16:33,407 --> 00:16:34,261
I mean that.

314
00:16:34,996 --> 00:16:36,663
This is a great experience.

315
00:16:36,786 --> 00:16:38,632
It's so nice of you to teach us.

316
00:16:38,849 --> 00:16:43,049
It's embarrassing to admit... but neither
one of us has ever made a curry dish before.

317
00:16:43,244 --> 00:16:45,679
It's an honor to learn from someone so talented.

318
00:16:46,986 --> 00:16:48,069
Now the carrots...

319
00:16:48,128 --> 00:16:49,835
Do we cut them into quarter-rounds?

320
00:16:50,201 --> 00:16:53,101
Huh? I think for curry, they're supposed to be in chunks.

321
00:16:53,222 --> 00:16:57,732
But quarter-rounds will look more appealing on the
plate, and besides, they'll cook faster at that size.

322
00:16:57,942 --> 00:17:00,335
Oh, Uiharu, don't you know anything?

323
00:17:00,513 --> 00:17:04,055
The key to a good curry is that the
vegetables are neither too big nor too small.

324
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:07,877
When we make curry at home, we chop the
veggies up smaller so they blend in with the sauce.

325
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:08,832
No, no, no!

326
00:17:08,857 --> 00:17:10,041
You've got it all wrong!

327
00:17:10,066 --> 00:17:13,312
You want the vegetables to be
large enough to add some substance.

328
00:17:13,585 --> 00:17:15,710
Making it taste good is the bigger concern.

329
00:17:15,735 --> 00:17:17,077
It tastes just fine my way!

330
00:17:18,445 --> 00:17:19,367
Let's settle this.

331
00:17:19,392 --> 00:17:21,536
The vegetables should be cut in bigger chunks, right?

332
00:17:21,561 --> 00:17:23,299
No, chopping them up is better, right?

333
00:17:27,324 --> 00:17:28,752
Okay, now I'm confused.

334
00:17:28,918 --> 00:17:30,165
They're grating the corn?

335
00:17:32,992 --> 00:17:34,755
Tomato skins, interesting.

336
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,669
They're pretty hard to peel, aren't they?

337
00:17:41,139 --> 00:17:42,843
And now we're adding seaweed?

338
00:17:42,868 --> 00:17:44,146
Also unexpected...

339
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:46,545
and difficult to cut up, too.

340
00:17:52,776 --> 00:17:54,769
We leave the peel on the tangerine...

341
00:17:54,794 --> 00:17:56,279
And slice it into rounds...

342
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:58,097
Ah! I got juice in my eye!

343
00:17:58,122 --> 00:17:59,901
Ow. That doesn't sound like fun.

344
00:18:02,954 --> 00:18:05,249
I wonder what the finished product will be like.

345
00:18:05,274 --> 00:18:08,132
I'm just excited about trying
the first curry I've ever made!

346
00:18:08,157 --> 00:18:10,240
The ingredient choices are all so unique!

347
00:18:10,358 --> 00:18:12,502
I never would've thought of adding burdock root.

348
00:18:12,527 --> 00:18:13,780
Or strawberries...!

349
00:18:13,931 --> 00:18:16,568
Ah... all this cooking is making me hungry!

350
00:18:16,735 --> 00:18:17,806
I can hardly wait!

351
00:18:19,901 --> 00:18:20,787
What's wrong?

352
00:18:22,171 --> 00:18:22,869
What is it?

353
00:18:25,031 --> 00:18:25,691
Um...

354
00:18:27,598 --> 00:18:28,590
The truth is...

355
00:18:29,086 --> 00:18:29,550
well...

356
00:18:31,331 --> 00:18:32,188
You see, I...

357
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,248
I've never actually made this curry recipe before, okay?

358
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:39,220
In fact, it's not just this...

359
00:18:39,729 --> 00:18:41,151
I've never done any cooking.

360
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:43,232
I'm sorry...

361
00:18:43,257 --> 00:18:46,314
It would have been too embarrassing
to back down after what I'd said.

362
00:18:50,276 --> 00:18:51,354
Well, in that case...

363
00:18:51,551 --> 00:18:53,635
we can ask the others to tell us how to make it.

364
00:18:54,308 --> 00:18:54,761
Yeah?

365
00:18:54,894 --> 00:18:56,316
I'm sure they wouldn't mind.

366
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:05,612
Do it, Sissy... do it, Sissy.

367
00:19:05,761 --> 00:19:07,416
You can do it, yes you can...!

368
00:19:07,672 --> 00:19:09,315
Do it, Sissy... do it, Sissy.

369
00:19:09,496 --> 00:19:11,627
You can do it. Yes, you can!

370
00:19:25,017 --> 00:19:26,684
Yeah! Time to eat!

371
00:19:28,385 --> 00:19:30,020
Here we have chicken curry!

372
00:19:30,093 --> 00:19:32,553
Which is accompanied by a lovely seafood curry.

373
00:19:32,667 --> 00:19:33,785
Looks great!

374
00:19:34,168 --> 00:19:35,708
Okay, everybody ready to eat?

375
00:19:35,733 --> 00:19:37,049
Absolutely!

376
00:19:41,316 --> 00:19:42,899
Mmm... It's delicious!

377
00:19:43,029 --> 00:19:45,679
You know, you really can still
taste the little vegetables.

378
00:19:45,704 --> 00:19:47,577
It's nice to have big ones in there, too!

379
00:19:54,064 --> 00:19:56,279
I'd say we did a pretty good job, wouldn't you?

380
00:19:56,363 --> 00:19:57,985
Yep. I couldn't agree more.

381
00:20:01,952 --> 00:20:03,357
This is great, isn't it?

382
00:20:03,465 --> 00:20:05,217
It was worth every bit of effort.

383
00:20:05,465 --> 00:20:06,360
Y... Yes.

384
00:20:20,865 --> 00:20:21,458
See?

385
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,936
It tastes better because we
all worked together to make it.

386
00:20:26,419 --> 00:20:28,423
You know, you seem like a nice person...

387
00:20:28,611 --> 00:20:29,806
What's your name again?

388
00:20:31,345 --> 00:20:34,317
Oh, um... I'm Mikoto Misaka.

389
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:36,803
Misaka? That sounds familiar...

390
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:39,882
Well, in any case...

391
00:20:40,033 --> 00:20:43,075
I've decided to give you the
opportunity to become my friend...

392
00:20:43,479 --> 00:20:44,622
How does that sound?

393
00:20:44,949 --> 00:20:46,126
Uh, that sounds great...

394
00:20:46,339 --> 00:20:47,180
Thanks a lot.

395
00:20:48,135 --> 00:20:49,223
Sorry for the delay.

396
00:20:49,876 --> 00:20:52,822
The system is up and running,
so we'll resume shooting now.

397
00:20:53,509 --> 00:20:54,785
Huh? Already?

398
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:56,771
Oh, you can continue eating...

399
00:20:57,457 --> 00:20:59,758
I think we can get some great shots of that.

400
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:06,973
Mmm... that was fantastic!

401
00:21:08,318 --> 00:21:10,516
I'll model anytime if we get to eat like that.

402
00:21:10,553 --> 00:21:12,312
It really was a lot of fun.

403
00:21:12,441 --> 00:21:14,774
I'm so glad you all had a good time today.

404
00:21:15,085 --> 00:21:18,205
I suppose eating peasant food
isn't so bad every once in a while.

405
00:21:18,604 --> 00:21:20,136
You did have seconds.

406
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:22,305
Hey... where's Misaka?

407
00:21:23,701 --> 00:21:24,831
Where'd she run off to?

408
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,085
Let's see here...

409
00:21:28,997 --> 00:21:30,368
No, that's not it...

410
00:21:31,017 --> 00:21:31,982
Maybe this one?

411
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,144
This bathing suit is adorable!

412
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:46,449
Now then...

413
00:21:50,766 --> 00:21:52,624
Woohoo!

414
00:21:53,493 --> 00:21:54,745
That looks like Zapper...

415
00:21:55,255 --> 00:21:57,540
what is she doing? Weird.

416
00:21:57,596 --> 00:21:59,256
I'm ready for my close-up!

417
00:23:31,857 --> 00:23:36,196
Who's there? You would dare to assault
Mitsuko Kongo of Tokiwadai Middle School?

418
00:23:36,221 --> 00:23:37,999
Um, I hate to break it to you, Kongo,

419
00:23:38,024 --> 00:23:39,952
but you're not actually in the next one.
