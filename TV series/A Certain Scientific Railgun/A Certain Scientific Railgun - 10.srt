1
00:00:13,816 --> 00:00:16,239
All I could do before was lift a paper cup.

2
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:18,505
This is the most amazing thing ever!

3
00:00:19,974 --> 00:00:20,934
Ruiko...?

4
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:28,094
It's happening...

5
00:00:28,385 --> 00:00:29,718
I'm doing something.

6
00:00:34,004 --> 00:00:36,691
How could you drop me like that, Akemi?!

7
00:00:36,754 --> 00:00:38,502
That was so uncool!

8
00:00:38,724 --> 00:00:39,656
It's not much...

9
00:00:39,839 --> 00:00:42,023
nothing like what Shirai and Misaka can do...

10
00:00:42,324 --> 00:00:43,207
but it's something...

11
00:00:43,866 --> 00:00:44,514
finally...

12
00:00:44,987 --> 00:00:47,554
After all this time, I'm an esper now, too.

13
00:00:50,405 --> 00:00:51,700
I can't believe it...!

14
00:00:51,814 --> 00:00:54,330
It's too good to be true...! but it is!

15
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:28,948
There. All done.

16
00:02:29,305 --> 00:02:32,593
Being able to level up just
by simply listening to a song...

17
00:02:32,688 --> 00:02:35,001
How can something like that even be possible?

18
00:02:35,097 --> 00:02:37,210
I don't fully understand it, either,

19
00:02:37,389 --> 00:02:39,450
but that's what our informant told me.

20
00:02:39,641 --> 00:02:41,254
Well I'm not sure I believe it.

21
00:02:42,031 --> 00:02:46,115
But what if I did listen to it and became
an even stronger esper than you are...?

22
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,665
That would certainly open up a
whole world of possibilities to me.

23
00:02:50,088 --> 00:02:52,345
And what would these possibilities be?

24
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:56,022
Perhaps you should go ahead and
give it a try so we can find out.

25
00:02:56,094 --> 00:02:57,920
Ah I'm kidding...! Just kidding...

26
00:02:57,992 --> 00:02:59,938
I would never do that, I promise!

27
00:03:01,273 --> 00:03:02,019
Hear that...?

28
00:03:02,186 --> 00:03:03,941
Sounds like your phone is ringing.

29
00:03:05,133 --> 00:03:05,697
Yes...

30
00:03:06,395 --> 00:03:08,320
Yes... I understand....

31
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:11,086
It seems we've got another situation on our hands...

32
00:03:11,157 --> 00:03:13,087
Contact Dr. Kiyama, will you, please?

33
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:14,912
Yeah, I'm on it.

34
00:03:16,383 --> 00:03:18,608
Yes. The item has already arrived.

35
00:03:18,814 --> 00:03:23,367
Can it really be possible for someone to
raise their ability level by listening to a song?

36
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:25,997
That is the question, huh?

37
00:03:26,307 --> 00:03:27,754
With a Testament maybe.

38
00:03:28,221 --> 00:03:29,828
Using a Testament?

39
00:03:30,059 --> 00:03:31,662
Do you have such a device?

40
00:03:33,664 --> 00:03:34,212
Oh...

41
00:03:35,372 --> 00:03:36,086
Yes...

42
00:03:36,737 --> 00:03:37,469
yes...

43
00:03:38,612 --> 00:03:39,629
You don't say...

44
00:03:40,536 --> 00:03:42,679
Okay, thanks for everything.

45
00:03:47,996 --> 00:03:51,799
I wonder if we could be barking up
the wrong tree with this music idea.

46
00:04:05,362 --> 00:04:07,082
Oh, Saten, I'm so glad you answered...

47
00:04:07,107 --> 00:04:10,707
The phone you have dialed is either out
of signal range or has been turned off...

48
00:04:11,201 --> 00:04:12,900
Please try your call again later.

49
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:26,044
Pretty impressive power, dontcha think?

50
00:04:26,658 --> 00:04:28,943
The Level Upper strikes again, huh?

51
00:04:29,539 --> 00:04:31,175
You wanna mess with me...?

52
00:04:31,278 --> 00:04:33,510
Go ahead and try it. See what happens.

53
00:04:36,608 --> 00:04:39,104
This must be pretty embarrassing for you.

54
00:04:39,129 --> 00:04:39,913
Bring it.

55
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,337
I'll show you my power!

56
00:04:43,584 --> 00:04:46,760
Man... I wish these creeps would give up already!

57
00:04:49,186 --> 00:04:51,622
Okay, this is gonna sting a bit...

58
00:04:55,249 --> 00:04:57,915
It seems like you're getting bruised up every day.

59
00:04:58,193 --> 00:05:02,984
There are so many people using Level Uppers
now, it doesn't seem like I have much of a choice.

60
00:05:03,023 --> 00:05:07,084
I wish there was some way we could figure
out how far this craze was spreading, y'know?

61
00:05:07,154 --> 00:05:08,738
Wishing won't do any good.

62
00:05:08,849 --> 00:05:10,430
This is going to take work.

63
00:05:10,581 --> 00:05:11,606
We need a plan...

64
00:05:11,717 --> 00:05:14,626
There are three things I think
we should be doing about this.

65
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:19,575
First, we get the item off the street, and
then we help those who've fallen into a coma.

66
00:05:19,646 --> 00:05:20,631
And then...

67
00:05:21,156 --> 00:05:23,359
We arrest whoever is responsible.

68
00:05:23,827 --> 00:05:26,933
We'll find out who created
this thing and made it available.

69
00:05:27,051 --> 00:05:31,263
And somehow or another, we'll learn
what their true motive was for doing it.

70
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,814
Well... let's get you taken care of first.

71
00:05:36,353 --> 00:05:39,477
Are you sure you wouldn't rather
have Misaka wrap you up, though?

72
00:05:39,502 --> 00:05:43,777
I would just as soon not have anybody
see me like this, much less my Sissy.

73
00:05:43,824 --> 00:05:47,106
I promise Shirai, nobody wants to see you like this.

74
00:05:48,905 --> 00:05:52,407
Hey, guys! I just wanted to see
if there was anything I could do...

75
00:05:55,026 --> 00:05:58,259
Oh... Hey, Sissy... great to see you.

76
00:06:01,017 --> 00:06:04,353
So, are you guys making any progress with the case?

77
00:06:04,908 --> 00:06:06,024
Hard to say...

78
00:06:06,409 --> 00:06:08,580
We have uncovered some new information...

79
00:06:08,635 --> 00:06:12,297
From what Dr. Kiyama tells us, there's
a certain device called a Testament,

80
00:06:12,353 --> 00:06:16,697
which is able to electrically input a
large quantity of data directly into the brain.

81
00:06:16,808 --> 00:06:22,465
However, it operates using all of the five human
senses. Taste, touch, hearing, smell and sight:

82
00:06:22,537 --> 00:06:24,181
all are at work with this thing.

83
00:06:24,522 --> 00:06:28,979
But we know the Level Upper is a music
file, so the only sense that it uses is hearing.

84
00:06:29,177 --> 00:06:33,142
We searched the rooms of all the
users who are now in vegetative states,

85
00:06:33,167 --> 00:06:36,375
but we didn't come up with any
relevant data other than the song.

86
00:06:40,064 --> 00:06:42,107
Okay let's look at this hypothetically...

87
00:06:42,572 --> 00:06:47,317
Do you think there's any way the song could have an
effect on all five senses, instead of just hearing?

88
00:06:47,357 --> 00:06:49,089
I don't really understand.

89
00:06:49,152 --> 00:06:52,664
Remember that conversation we had
when we were eating the shaved ice?

90
00:06:54,276 --> 00:06:55,707
Let me see...

91
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:56,915
About brain freezes?

92
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,242
No that's not what I meant.

93
00:06:59,742 --> 00:07:01,244
It's synesthesia!

94
00:07:01,499 --> 00:07:02,652
Synes... what?

95
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,860
Something we were talking about the other day...

96
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:08,365
It's what occurs when a single thing
stimulates more than one of the senses.

97
00:07:08,412 --> 00:07:12,009
You stimulate one sense with a
particular method, and others react too,

98
00:07:12,105 --> 00:07:14,440
even though those senses weren't the original targets.

99
00:07:14,465 --> 00:07:17,857
So in this case, do you mean by
stimulating the senses using sound,

100
00:07:17,882 --> 00:07:20,691
you could get the same effect
you would get by using a Testament?

101
00:07:21,241 --> 00:07:23,139
Yes, it is a possibility.

102
00:07:23,896 --> 00:07:25,842
I had overlooked that until now.

103
00:07:26,294 --> 00:07:29,269
Would you mind pursuing that avenue of investigation?

104
00:07:29,294 --> 00:07:33,954
Yeah... and in this case, I should even be
able to get permission to use Tree Diagram.

105
00:07:34,104 --> 00:07:35,663
Tree Diagram, really?!..

106
00:07:35,885 --> 00:07:38,873
Academy City's greatest
supercomputer should speed things up!

107
00:07:38,968 --> 00:07:40,946
I'll be in touch once I have the results.

108
00:07:40,971 --> 00:07:43,369
Would you mind if I headed over there right now...?

109
00:07:43,503 --> 00:07:47,300
I'd love the chance to see Tree
Diagram at work. It must be amazing.

110
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:49,317
Sure... come on over.

111
00:07:58,502 --> 00:08:02,275
Nice, huh...? I can do this
after only five days of practicing.

112
00:08:02,317 --> 00:08:03,893
Have you seen what I've been doing?

113
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:05,418
It's all amazing.

114
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,764
Maybe I should at least tell Uiharu about all this.

115
00:08:11,443 --> 00:08:14,101
Knowing her, though, she'll be mad at me for doing it.

116
00:08:17,774 --> 00:08:18,618
Akemi!

117
00:08:18,642 --> 00:08:20,338
Akemi...! What happened?

118
00:08:21,433 --> 00:08:22,225
Akemi!

119
00:08:22,308 --> 00:08:23,330
Akemi, wake up!

120
00:08:23,355 --> 00:08:23,962
Are you okay?

121
00:08:23,987 --> 00:08:24,622
Akemi!

122
00:08:28,584 --> 00:08:31,175
Finally, you answered... I've been worried about you....

123
00:08:31,317 --> 00:08:34,455
You seemed really distant at school, and I
haven't been able to get you on the phone.

124
00:08:34,542 --> 00:08:35,417
All of a sudden.

125
00:08:35,845 --> 00:08:36,472
What?

126
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,158
Akemi. She just collapsed all of a sudden.

127
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:43,433
I didn't know that using the Level Upper
could make anything like that happen....

128
00:08:43,504 --> 00:08:45,434
She just fell down out of nowhere.

129
00:08:46,021 --> 00:08:48,239
It's like something out of a bad dream.

130
00:08:49,501 --> 00:08:50,797
I can't believe this...

131
00:08:50,987 --> 00:08:52,790
I just-I had no idea.

132
00:08:53,721 --> 00:08:54,364
Okay...

133
00:08:54,522 --> 00:08:55,580
You need to calm down...

134
00:08:55,642 --> 00:08:57,304
Go slow. Start from the beginning.

135
00:08:58,514 --> 00:09:01,738
Well, the thing is, I got my hands on a Level Upper.

136
00:09:02,183 --> 00:09:05,193
You said anyone found in possession
of one would be in trouble...

137
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,118
But I couldn't bring myself to get rid of it.

138
00:09:08,213 --> 00:09:11,351
And then Akemi and the others
said they really wanted one...

139
00:09:12,488 --> 00:09:14,457
No... the truth is...

140
00:09:14,553 --> 00:09:17,969
I... I was too afraid to use it by myself.

141
00:09:18,112 --> 00:09:19,980
Never mind. Where are you now?

142
00:09:20,756 --> 00:09:23,085
Do you think whatever this is will happen to me, too?

143
00:09:23,902 --> 00:09:25,899
And if it does,... will I ever wake up?

144
00:09:26,057 --> 00:09:27,670
Or will I be unconscious forever?

145
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:30,041
I couldn't take it...

146
00:09:30,505 --> 00:09:32,944
I was so tired of not having any power.

147
00:09:34,106 --> 00:09:38,111
And finally, it didn't matter anymore
what lengths I had to go to to get it.

148
00:09:42,132 --> 00:09:42,886
Mama...

149
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:45,247
Huh...? What did you just say?

150
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:49,116
Maybe Level Zeroes like me are permanently defective.

151
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,229
No, don't talk like that.

152
00:09:51,562 --> 00:09:54,899
I ignored the rules and went
looking for power of my own, anyway...

153
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,092
Maybe I'm being punished for that.

154
00:09:58,816 --> 00:10:02,558
I got involved in something
dangerous... and it hurt my friends...

155
00:10:02,605 --> 00:10:04,591
I... I'm awful!

156
00:10:08,501 --> 00:10:09,793
It'll be okay!

157
00:10:12,061 --> 00:10:16,057
If you fall asleep, I'll wake you up...
It's not gonna be forever, I promise you!

158
00:10:16,461 --> 00:10:19,244
You, and Akemi, and everybody else who's gotten sick.

159
00:10:19,307 --> 00:10:21,951
We'll make you all better in no time! I know it!

160
00:10:22,523 --> 00:10:26,035
So you just sit back and leave
everything to me, understand?!

161
00:10:26,566 --> 00:10:30,562
Saten, you just need to hang in there, and
things will get better before you know it!

162
00:10:34,353 --> 00:10:35,577
Uiharu...

163
00:10:36,283 --> 00:10:39,065
Being a Level Zero doesn't make you defective.

164
00:10:39,589 --> 00:10:44,912
Even without abilities, you're so full of life and
energy, it's a challenge to keep up with you every day.

165
00:10:45,681 --> 00:10:49,606
No amount of power could make you more
incredible than you already are to me.

166
00:10:49,677 --> 00:10:51,299
You're my best friend in the world!

167
00:10:52,746 --> 00:10:55,057
So stop it... just stop it!

168
00:10:55,597 --> 00:10:57,704
Stop saying such horrible things...

169
00:10:58,794 --> 00:11:00,563
because they aren't true!

170
00:11:12,459 --> 00:11:15,104
You're asking me to put all my trust in you on this one?

171
00:11:15,953 --> 00:11:17,876
No, I'm not saying it's just me!

172
00:11:18,066 --> 00:11:21,436
There's Misaka and Shirai and lots
of other people working on it, too.

173
00:11:22,562 --> 00:11:23,373
Yes...

174
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:25,607
of course there are...

175
00:11:26,162 --> 00:11:27,274
Thanks a lot...

176
00:11:27,754 --> 00:11:28,918
You're a good friend.

177
00:11:31,163 --> 00:11:33,210
Sorry for causing so much trouble.

178
00:11:33,872 --> 00:11:36,008
I'll let you handle it from here, okay?

179
00:12:04,986 --> 00:12:07,190
Saten... no!

180
00:12:20,302 --> 00:12:22,740
So, Saten used the Level Upper?

181
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:23,606
Yes.

182
00:12:23,773 --> 00:12:28,118
Uiharu wanted to make sure Saten was here
and as stable as they could make her right now.

183
00:12:28,174 --> 00:12:30,701
Then she took the data and hurried to Dr. Kiyama.

184
00:12:31,629 --> 00:12:32,130
Oh.

185
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,720
Do you have a second?

186
00:12:37,516 --> 00:12:39,460
What did you want to talk about out here?

187
00:12:39,924 --> 00:12:41,775
Saten had a good luck charm...

188
00:12:42,037 --> 00:12:43,038
Do you remember it?

189
00:12:43,173 --> 00:12:46,384
Oh, wait... the thing she
always had dangling from her bag?

190
00:12:46,535 --> 00:12:47,465
That's the one...

191
00:12:47,711 --> 00:12:50,102
She said she got it as a gift from her mother...

192
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:52,471
right before she came to Academy City.

193
00:12:52,653 --> 00:12:54,948
She told you that? It sounds very personal.

194
00:12:55,663 --> 00:12:56,369
Yeah...

195
00:12:56,687 --> 00:12:59,714
I get the feeling there were a
lot of things she wanted to tell me.

196
00:13:00,588 --> 00:13:02,064
But I just froze up.

197
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,949
They can call me a Level 5 all they want...

198
00:13:05,346 --> 00:13:07,795
but I'm not any good when it comes to this stuff.

199
00:13:08,795 --> 00:13:10,225
Aw, that's not true.

200
00:13:10,941 --> 00:13:12,701
It's the kind of person I am...

201
00:13:13,102 --> 00:13:15,291
someone places a hurdle in front of me,

202
00:13:15,723 --> 00:13:18,013
and I can't rest until I've jumped over it.

203
00:13:19,489 --> 00:13:21,936
That's how I felt about reaching Level 5...

204
00:13:22,278 --> 00:13:25,305
It never seemed like anything particularly great.

205
00:13:27,035 --> 00:13:27,519
But...

206
00:13:28,168 --> 00:13:31,120
I guess there are some hurdles that you can't cross.

207
00:13:32,256 --> 00:13:36,014
I'd never thought how difficult
it must be to be in that situation.

208
00:13:36,938 --> 00:13:39,263
"Does your Level really matter that much?"...

209
00:13:40,868 --> 00:13:42,308
Come on.

210
00:13:44,294 --> 00:13:46,280
How inconsiderate can I be?

211
00:13:49,934 --> 00:13:52,779
Will you please let me help you out with this one case...?

212
00:13:52,826 --> 00:13:54,700
I feel like it's something I owe to Saten.

213
00:13:55,865 --> 00:13:57,265
I guess I can do that.

214
00:13:59,285 --> 00:14:00,501
That's awesome...

215
00:14:00,672 --> 00:14:02,041
Thanks Kuroko.

216
00:14:03,638 --> 00:14:06,531
I... I should be thanking you.

217
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:11,199
Do you have a moment?

218
00:14:12,631 --> 00:14:14,232
A real Gekota!

219
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:17,365
Calm down, Sissy, he's just a normal doctor.

220
00:14:18,414 --> 00:14:22,529
What we're looking at are the brainwave
patterns of the Level Upper victims.

221
00:14:22,854 --> 00:14:28,375
Brainwaves vary from person to person, so the
waveforms should all be quite different across the board.

222
00:14:28,469 --> 00:14:31,332
However, I noticed something surprising in this case.

223
00:14:31,396 --> 00:14:34,725
Each of the Level Upper victims
has a common brainwave pattern.

224
00:14:34,811 --> 00:14:36,363
What does that mean, exactly?

225
00:14:36,466 --> 00:14:38,587
It could point to an outside influence...

226
00:14:38,746 --> 00:14:42,232
Perhaps somebody else is forcing their
brains into these particular patterns,

227
00:14:42,257 --> 00:14:44,449
and thus controlling the function of their bodies.

228
00:14:45,457 --> 00:14:50,289
So someone controlling the Level Upper is tampering
with their brains to put them all into a coma?

229
00:14:50,359 --> 00:14:52,109
Why would somebody want to do that?

230
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:55,163
I'm just a humble doctor reporting my findings to you...

231
00:14:56,113 --> 00:14:58,089
Determining the motive is your job.

232
00:15:23,887 --> 00:15:24,696
I see.

233
00:15:25,365 --> 00:15:27,057
That girl we met the other day.

234
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,480
I feel so responsible.

235
00:15:29,765 --> 00:15:31,959
You can't blame yourself for what happened to her...

236
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:34,699
Sit here and calm down...

237
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:37,194
I'm going to put on some coffee.

238
00:15:37,337 --> 00:15:39,632
This is no time to be calm and relaxed.

239
00:15:41,452 --> 00:15:43,941
The results of the analysis haven't come through yet...

240
00:15:44,584 --> 00:15:46,794
If she wakes up to find you've collapsed...

241
00:15:46,825 --> 00:15:49,931
that's not going to do either one of you any good will it?

242
00:15:50,669 --> 00:15:51,814
It will be okay...

243
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:54,141
I'm sure everything is going to work out in the end.

244
00:16:15,864 --> 00:16:18,983
If this really does match a
specific person's brainwave pattern...

245
00:16:19,008 --> 00:16:22,600
All we have to do is have Uiharu run
a search through the databank, and...

246
00:16:24,379 --> 00:16:26,588
Right, Uiharu isn't here to do that.

247
00:16:26,613 --> 00:16:27,907
Yeah, that's a problem.

248
00:16:27,932 --> 00:16:30,473
Goodness, what's all the moaning
and groaning about in here?

249
00:16:32,056 --> 00:16:33,659
Well, since you asked...

250
00:16:35,145 --> 00:16:40,134
If that's the case, the first step we'll need to
take is to access the databank to get the information.

251
00:16:40,245 --> 00:16:42,250
What if the data isn't in the databank?

252
00:16:42,337 --> 00:16:43,655
It will be there somewhere.

253
00:16:43,789 --> 00:16:48,484
Data is stored on any adult who has been to
the hospital or taken a vocational aptitude test,

254
00:16:48,531 --> 00:16:51,797
along with all the students
undergoing ability development.

255
00:16:51,892 --> 00:16:54,707
Okay... but this is all still really confusing...

256
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:57,788
How could using the Level Upper
reprogram somebody's brain waves?

257
00:16:57,813 --> 00:17:00,840
And moreover, how would doing that
raise somebody's ability level...?

258
00:17:00,983 --> 00:17:02,880
So much of this seems impossible.

259
00:17:02,905 --> 00:17:04,025
It's like a computer.

260
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:06,244
Not even one of those will increase in performance that

261
00:17:06,269 --> 00:17:09,109
dramatically just because you're
running different software on it.

262
00:17:09,355 --> 00:17:11,550
Unless it's connected to a network, anyway.

263
00:17:11,796 --> 00:17:15,075
So a computer's performance
increases when connected to a network?

264
00:17:15,123 --> 00:17:17,682
Well, individually, there's no major improvement...

265
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:21,202
But you can connect a lot of different
computers in a parallel network...

266
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:23,586
then their computing power does increase.

267
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:27,303
That's it... Whoever's behind this
is constructing a network of brains!

268
00:17:27,328 --> 00:17:28,854
And they're doing it with the Level Upper!

269
00:17:28,909 --> 00:17:30,564
Well, it is a possibility.

270
00:17:30,777 --> 00:17:31,845
But how does it work?

271
00:17:31,879 --> 00:17:34,125
What's connecting all of their brainwaves together?

272
00:17:34,228 --> 00:17:36,104
If I had to make a guess, then...

273
00:17:36,318 --> 00:17:38,368
maybe an AIM diffusion field...?

274
00:17:38,811 --> 00:17:42,514
All espers emit a force around
themselves without even being aware of it.

275
00:17:42,696 --> 00:17:44,581
If those were to be connected....

276
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,586
But you said espers do that unconsciously...

277
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:52,149
Besides, if we're comparing humans to computers,
wouldn't we all run different operating systems...?

278
00:17:52,479 --> 00:17:54,941
How would it be possible to link up together, then?

279
00:17:55,052 --> 00:17:58,269
Computers in a network also
have different operating systems;

280
00:17:58,333 --> 00:18:00,042
they even use different languages.

281
00:18:00,804 --> 00:18:04,047
But networks can be created by
putting certain protocols in place.

282
00:18:05,747 --> 00:18:09,258
So in this case, you're saying that a
particular person's brainwave pattern

283
00:18:09,283 --> 00:18:11,482
is serving as the protocol for the whole network?

284
00:18:11,546 --> 00:18:13,413
It's all speculation at this point.

285
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,273
Okay... and if a number of
brains were connected like that...

286
00:18:16,391 --> 00:18:19,664
they would be able to do an enormous amount of computing.

287
00:18:20,697 --> 00:18:24,671
So one person might have only a weak
ability, but by plugging into the network,

288
00:18:24,702 --> 00:18:28,803
the throughput of that ability would increase,
making the person significantly stronger.

289
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,535
Add to that the collective thought
patterns of espers who have the same talent,

290
00:18:32,598 --> 00:18:35,523
and you'd be able to manage
that ability much more efficiently.

291
00:18:35,562 --> 00:18:37,525
It would be an incredible boost in power.

292
00:18:37,588 --> 00:18:43,277
So my hypothesis is that all the brain activity of
the coma patients is being used to power this network.

293
00:18:44,848 --> 00:18:45,941
Hey, here we go!

294
00:18:46,161 --> 00:18:49,131
The brain patterns' agreement
rate is ninety... nine percent.

295
00:18:53,978 --> 00:18:54,787
This, too...

296
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:55,938
and this.

297
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,386
These are all papers on synesthesia...

298
00:18:59,389 --> 00:19:00,306
but why?

299
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:04,836
How impolite of you.

300
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:10,151
Looking at somebody's research
papers without asking permission.

301
00:19:11,327 --> 00:19:13,576
Can... can it be true?

302
00:19:13,703 --> 00:19:14,927
Registrant name...

303
00:19:15,459 --> 00:19:16,710
Harumi Kiyama?!

304
00:19:17,516 --> 00:19:18,693
Uiharu!

305
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:20,449
What do you mean? What about her?

306
00:19:20,474 --> 00:19:23,325
She said earlier that she was
on her way to Dr. Kiyama's office!

307
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:24,445
What's she doing?

308
00:19:26,034 --> 00:19:26,962
Uiharu!

309
00:19:28,673 --> 00:19:30,126
I'm not getting through to her.

310
00:19:30,151 --> 00:19:33,344
Contact Antiskill and have them
take the doctor into custody...

311
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:35,830
but be sure to warn them. There might be a hostage.

312
00:19:35,891 --> 00:19:36,506
Right!

313
00:19:44,764 --> 00:19:45,797
You know something...?

314
00:19:46,011 --> 00:19:48,449
I've been wondering about this for a while now...

315
00:19:48,497 --> 00:19:50,658
What's with all the flowers in your hair...?

316
00:19:50,951 --> 00:19:53,675
Does it have something to do
with your ability as an esper?

317
00:19:53,739 --> 00:19:55,748
I don't see why I should answer your questions.

318
00:19:55,828 --> 00:19:57,194
But I have some for you...

319
00:19:57,266 --> 00:19:59,299
I want you to tell me about the Level Upper.

320
00:19:59,585 --> 00:20:01,230
Why have you done all of this...?

321
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,606
What will happen to the people who are sick?

322
00:20:04,523 --> 00:20:06,359
You are full of questions...

323
00:20:06,445 --> 00:20:09,828
And yet you refuse to answer
the single question I asked of you.

324
00:20:10,018 --> 00:20:13,010
What do you get out of randomly
increasing someone's ability...?

325
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:15,593
You raise their hopes, and then you put them in a coma?

326
00:20:16,196 --> 00:20:18,380
Saten's a kind, loving person.

327
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:21,943
She doesn't deserve something like this.

328
00:20:23,312 --> 00:20:26,658
I have no interest at all in other people's abilities.

329
00:20:27,316 --> 00:20:30,598
My ultimate objective is much greater than that.

330
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:35,000
I'm coming along, too.

331
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:37,526
Although I don't normally like
getting civilians involved...

332
00:20:37,629 --> 00:20:40,535
having someone with your power around could be beneficial.

333
00:20:43,506 --> 00:20:44,706
Hold on, Sissy!

334
00:20:45,231 --> 00:20:47,687
Don't forget Uiharu's a member of Judgment.

335
00:20:47,785 --> 00:20:49,808
She can handle herself if she needs to.

336
00:20:51,991 --> 00:20:54,678
Probably... if she's lucky...

337
00:20:56,738 --> 00:20:58,571
It isn't that unlikely...

338
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:02,322
Besides, Antiskill is getting involved, too.

339
00:21:02,347 --> 00:21:05,866
I doubt a scrawny scientist like her
will be able to do much against them.

340
00:21:06,048 --> 00:21:10,275
The lives of thousands of comatose
espers are in her hands as we speak.

341
00:21:11,325 --> 00:21:11,957
Plus...

342
00:21:12,235 --> 00:21:14,199
I've just got a bad feeling about this...

343
00:21:14,224 --> 00:21:17,473
You're right... This could be bad...
Which is why a Judgment officer...

344
00:21:22,352 --> 00:21:24,530
Are you in good enough shape to go into action?

345
00:21:24,578 --> 00:21:26,991
You mean you knew... about all my injuries?

346
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:28,398
Yeah, of course I did.

347
00:21:31,696 --> 00:21:34,213
You may be strong, but I'm still the older one here.

348
00:21:34,879 --> 00:21:36,143
It's been a rough week...

349
00:21:36,365 --> 00:21:38,097
so you can turn to your Sissy.

350
00:21:42,671 --> 00:21:43,945
Thank you, Sissy.

351
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,412
I had a great time today...

352
00:23:33,682 --> 00:23:36,119
And I think I'll finish by undressing for the preview...

353
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:36,885
Next time...

354
00:23:36,909 --> 00:23:37,992
Keep your clothes on!

355
00:23:38,071 --> 00:23:40,182
And get ready, 'cause I'm taking you down!
