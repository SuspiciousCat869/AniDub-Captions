1
00:00:30,621 --> 00:00:31,813
Oh, hi there, Tesso.

2
00:00:33,529 --> 00:00:36,295
Still hard at work, I see... even during summer vacation.

3
00:00:36,637 --> 00:00:39,137
Yeah, I still had some loose ends that needed tying up.

4
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:41,211
Quite the busy little bee, aren't you?

5
00:00:41,613 --> 00:00:42,187
Yeah...

6
00:00:43,364 --> 00:00:45,127
Ah! It's that late already?!

7
00:00:45,897 --> 00:00:47,644
You have to work at your other job today, too?

8
00:00:47,669 --> 00:00:48,704
And I need to hurry!

9
00:00:48,795 --> 00:00:50,624
See you later! Have a good day!

10
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:52,396
Well, be careful out there.

11
00:00:53,781 --> 00:00:54,796
Ow ow ow!

12
00:00:56,429 --> 00:00:57,767
I really don't have time for this!

13
00:00:58,210 --> 00:00:59,253
No I'm serious.

14
00:01:00,488 --> 00:01:01,668
Be very careful.

15
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:06,293
Oh! The train!

16
00:01:10,855 --> 00:01:15,555
Wait for me!!

17
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:31,184
Why do these things always happen to me?!

18
00:03:04,662 --> 00:03:06,565
Sorry, I know I'm late!

19
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:09,305
No kidding... You're good and late, aren't you?

20
00:03:10,328 --> 00:03:11,656
R... really sorry.

21
00:03:11,755 --> 00:03:14,238
Students get restless when they're on summer vacation...

22
00:03:14,263 --> 00:03:17,245
Judgment has a hard time maintaining
discipline in the city on their own,

23
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:19,346
so we've been called in to assist whenever we can.

24
00:03:19,846 --> 00:03:21,952
You're late. Now get over it and pull yourself together.

25
00:03:22,341 --> 00:03:23,945
Right... I will. I'm sorry.

26
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:24,988
Honestly.

27
00:03:26,678 --> 00:03:27,752
Yes, Yomikawa...

28
00:03:28,943 --> 00:03:29,722
A robbery?

29
00:03:31,048 --> 00:03:31,678
Roger that...

30
00:03:33,217 --> 00:03:35,125
Make up for your mistake by doing well today.

31
00:03:35,346 --> 00:03:35,855
Got it?

32
00:03:36,523 --> 00:03:37,008
Yes!

33
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:39,868
Can you help me, please, Yomikawa?!

34
00:03:40,037 --> 00:03:41,362
All of you, just stay back!

35
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:43,117
Come any closer and I'll kill 'er!

36
00:03:43,142 --> 00:03:44,524
Forget about me... Take him down.

37
00:03:44,549 --> 00:03:45,046
What should we do?

38
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:45,787
Keep quiet!

39
00:03:46,072 --> 00:03:46,933
Let me have that.

40
00:03:47,226 --> 00:03:47,806
Ma'am?

41
00:03:48,104 --> 00:03:49,418
Don't think I won't do it!

42
00:03:55,289 --> 00:03:56,321
I'm in the zone!

43
00:03:57,074 --> 00:03:58,741
Well, that was a pathetic display.

44
00:03:58,881 --> 00:04:01,548
Huh? She got the all-time high score. That's impressive!

45
00:04:01,573 --> 00:04:03,539
It wasn't too shabby, I'll grant you that.

46
00:04:04,003 --> 00:04:05,864
But... Wait 'til you see me go!

47
00:04:07,134 --> 00:04:07,721
Come on.

48
00:04:08,295 --> 00:04:10,686
The hostages had been rescued, so you let your guard down.

49
00:04:11,037 --> 00:04:11,954
Look where that got you.

50
00:04:11,989 --> 00:04:13,594
I didn't think he'd move so fast.

51
00:04:16,023 --> 00:04:16,769
I did it!

52
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:18,221
You beat my high score?

53
00:04:18,246 --> 00:04:20,390
That's incredible, Saten. Good job!

54
00:04:20,415 --> 00:04:22,725
Well look at that. It's almost time for school curfew.

55
00:04:22,947 --> 00:04:23,979
Yep, just about.

56
00:04:24,589 --> 00:04:26,014
Go in there and do your job.

57
00:04:27,157 --> 00:04:29,486
Make up for your mistakes by working hard, remember?

58
00:04:29,787 --> 00:04:31,287
Oh... right.

59
00:04:32,714 --> 00:04:34,595
This time I'm gonna hit it like I mean it.

60
00:04:34,829 --> 00:04:37,549
Oh, so now you're saying you
didn't give it your all last time?

61
00:04:37,641 --> 00:04:40,100
Please, don't get carried away
and start kicking and stuff.

62
00:04:40,141 --> 00:04:41,904
Oh...! I didn't know I could!

63
00:04:41,929 --> 00:04:43,739
But you shouldn't. That would be cheating.

64
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:45,670
Hey... that's it for today.

65
00:04:46,741 --> 00:04:49,243
Time's up. It's going to be
school curfew any minute now...

66
00:04:49,871 --> 00:04:51,955
You four should hurry on back to your dorms.

67
00:04:52,352 --> 00:04:52,963
Oh, hey...

68
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:54,703
I recognize her.

69
00:04:56,903 --> 00:04:58,142
You're those girls...

70
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:00,890
We were in a tight spot, and you helped us. Thank you.

71
00:05:00,915 --> 00:05:03,132
I should be thanking you for all the help you gave us.

72
00:05:03,301 --> 00:05:05,372
You know, you look a lot skinner than I remember.

73
00:05:06,595 --> 00:05:08,790
If I had to guess, I'd say it's due to exhaustion.

74
00:05:08,815 --> 00:05:09,940
Oh? I don't think so...

75
00:05:10,133 --> 00:05:11,022
No, she's right.

76
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:12,221
You're as pale as a ghost.

77
00:05:12,246 --> 00:05:13,828
You should take better care of your skin.

78
00:05:14,352 --> 00:05:17,028
You guys over in Antiskill must have it really rough, huh?

79
00:05:17,298 --> 00:05:18,290
Yeah, that's the truth.

80
00:05:18,871 --> 00:05:19,649
What do you say?

81
00:05:19,921 --> 00:05:20,935
Want to give it a try?

82
00:05:20,985 --> 00:05:22,532
It's an excellent stress reliever.

83
00:05:22,787 --> 00:05:24,597
I don't think so. I'm still on duty.

84
00:05:24,872 --> 00:05:27,247
Who knows, it might do wonders for your skin, too.

85
00:05:28,396 --> 00:05:30,697
Well... maybe I could play just one game...

86
00:05:31,951 --> 00:05:33,526
Games aren't in your job description...

87
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:35,893
Now, get moving, girls. Back to your dorm rooms.

88
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:37,824
It's the scary teacher from the workshop.

89
00:05:38,142 --> 00:05:39,795
Come on, move it! Curfew!

90
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:40,764
Everybody outta here!

91
00:05:41,579 --> 00:05:42,385
You heard me.

92
00:05:42,621 --> 00:05:43,210
Go on.

93
00:05:44,546 --> 00:05:44,959
Huh?

94
00:05:45,784 --> 00:05:46,594
That's Konoe.

95
00:05:47,073 --> 00:05:47,883
Friend of yours?

96
00:05:48,248 --> 00:05:50,204
No, not really. He does go to our school,

97
00:05:50,229 --> 00:05:51,626
but we don't know him all that well.

98
00:05:52,005 --> 00:05:54,048
He's kind of the unapproachable type, you know?

99
00:06:06,329 --> 00:06:08,168
Ow! That really hurts!

100
00:06:10,019 --> 00:06:11,561
What's the matter with you, Tesso?

101
00:06:11,803 --> 00:06:14,657
Oh, the hot water stings the spots where I got scraped up.

102
00:06:14,793 --> 00:06:16,135
I'm not talking about that...

103
00:06:16,396 --> 00:06:18,360
I wanna know what was the matter with you today...

104
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:21,469
First you were late, then you got yourself taken hostage,

105
00:06:21,494 --> 00:06:24,073
and then you were manipulated
by a group of young students.

106
00:06:24,398 --> 00:06:25,367
Yeah...

107
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:29,226
I can't say you were always the best Antiskill officer,

108
00:06:29,367 --> 00:06:31,594
but today was a particularly poor showing.

109
00:06:32,165 --> 00:06:33,437
I know. Sorry.

110
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:36,429
Well... Whatever else happened today,

111
00:06:36,454 --> 00:06:39,681
a nice, hot bath is always a great
way to finish a long day of work.

112
00:06:39,912 --> 00:06:41,135
Yeah, it sure is.

113
00:06:41,329 --> 00:06:43,193
Komoe thinks so, too. Isn't that right?

114
00:06:53,295 --> 00:06:55,086
Hey, Pops, an order of gizzards!

115
00:06:55,329 --> 00:06:56,162
Here ya go.

116
00:07:00,592 --> 00:07:02,204
Hard-drinking as ever, huh?

117
00:07:02,287 --> 00:07:04,248
Well, here's to you!

118
00:07:05,002 --> 00:07:06,191
Now, Tsuzuri Tesso!

119
00:07:06,215 --> 00:07:07,418
Uh... yes?

120
00:07:07,525 --> 00:07:10,849
Listen to me! Your problem is
that you're a wimpy little insect...

121
00:07:10,874 --> 00:07:12,193
You gotta hold your head high.

122
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,586
Sometimes you gotta give life a hard smack in the face.

123
00:07:16,611 --> 00:07:17,555
A good, hard smack!

124
00:07:18,216 --> 00:07:20,721
That's right. Sometimes a girl's got no other choice.

125
00:07:21,044 --> 00:07:22,726
Ah! That's enough!

126
00:07:23,621 --> 00:07:25,458
Hey, Pops. How 'bout some liver steaks?

127
00:07:25,483 --> 00:07:26,419
Here ya go.

128
00:07:37,012 --> 00:07:38,703
A hard smack... huh?

129
00:07:41,662 --> 00:07:42,994
I will try harder.

130
00:07:45,246 --> 00:07:47,491
Today's patrol is from Area A through D...

131
00:07:47,746 --> 00:07:49,088
Let's split up and get to it.

132
00:07:49,397 --> 00:07:50,596
Are you ready, Tesso?

133
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,344
Yes!

134
00:07:52,496 --> 00:07:53,376
Let's see...

135
00:07:54,295 --> 00:07:56,318
That way is north, so that means...

136
00:07:58,629 --> 00:08:01,100
Where did you get separated from your mommy, little one?

137
00:08:09,317 --> 00:08:11,118
Nothing is going right today.

138
00:08:15,314 --> 00:08:16,162
It's that boy.

139
00:08:18,504 --> 00:08:19,316
Here I go.

140
00:08:22,685 --> 00:08:23,306
You there.

141
00:08:23,763 --> 00:08:25,252
Have you looked at a clock lately?

142
00:08:25,277 --> 00:08:26,221
It's almost curfew...

143
00:08:26,293 --> 00:08:28,037
You need to pack it up and head home.

144
00:08:29,034 --> 00:08:30,502
Hey, are you listening to me?

145
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:34,239
Gekisho 9!

146
00:08:35,401 --> 00:08:38,354
I wouldn't think they'd have an old
classic game like this in Academy City.

147
00:08:38,379 --> 00:08:39,832
It sure takes me back, though!

148
00:08:40,276 --> 00:08:41,747
I used to play this a lot...

149
00:08:41,859 --> 00:08:44,066
They never did come out with ten, did they?

150
00:08:44,614 --> 00:08:45,606
K.O.!!

151
00:08:46,956 --> 00:08:47,960
Anyway, enough of that.

152
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:49,433
It's time for you to get going.

153
00:08:54,119 --> 00:08:55,076
Hey, you...!

154
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,874
Pig's trotters, please, Pops!

155
00:09:28,162 --> 00:09:29,027
Here ya go.

156
00:09:29,467 --> 00:09:32,529
Let's add on some shrimp cakes
and bamboo shoot sashimi, too.

157
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:33,471
Here ya go.

158
00:09:33,496 --> 00:09:34,076
Hey, Tesso...

159
00:09:34,921 --> 00:09:35,508
Yeah?

160
00:09:35,912 --> 00:09:38,202
You know, if something's bothering you, I'm all ears...

161
00:09:38,227 --> 00:09:39,514
It's okay, you can tell me.

162
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:42,079
Oh, goodie! Are we talking about boys?

163
00:09:42,741 --> 00:09:44,838
Thank you, but nothing's really bothering me.

164
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:48,119
Oh, really? Then why do you keep
screwing things up all the time?

165
00:09:48,849 --> 00:09:49,904
I dunno. Sorry.

166
00:09:50,207 --> 00:09:51,199
How does it go...?

167
00:09:51,431 --> 00:09:52,678
Something along the lines of

168
00:09:52,703 --> 00:09:54,401
"Gather ye rosebuds while ye may."

169
00:09:54,674 --> 00:09:55,679
She's right, Tesso.

170
00:09:55,704 --> 00:09:57,184
Your life shouldn't be all about work.

171
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,305
Maybe what you need is a hobby...

172
00:09:59,552 --> 00:10:02,785
Do something you enjoy every once in a
while, and you won't be so burned out.

173
00:10:03,121 --> 00:10:04,494
Something I enjoy. Like what?

174
00:10:04,994 --> 00:10:07,471
Summer's the best time for a young woman to find herself!

175
00:10:07,496 --> 00:10:08,726
Cut loose! Run wild!

176
00:10:08,751 --> 00:10:10,467
Anything goes! The sky's the limit!

177
00:10:10,492 --> 00:10:11,985
Yeah...! Go nuts!

178
00:10:13,309 --> 00:10:14,454
Go nuts, huh?

179
00:10:17,027 --> 00:10:18,355
Yes, you're right.

180
00:10:18,705 --> 00:10:19,477
Thanks.

181
00:10:19,539 --> 00:10:20,255
Good!

182
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:22,345
Pops, give us something special.

183
00:10:22,464 --> 00:10:23,347
Here ya go.

184
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:24,744
Um, Komoe...

185
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:27,334
there's something I've been
meaning to ask you for a while.

186
00:10:27,564 --> 00:10:28,582
Okay, shoot.

187
00:10:29,137 --> 00:10:32,250
Uh... what kind of restaurant is this, exactly?

188
00:10:36,543 --> 00:10:37,909
You're gonna be late again?

189
00:10:38,385 --> 00:10:39,824
What in the world are you doing?

190
00:10:40,229 --> 00:10:41,094
Well, you see...

191
00:10:41,119 --> 00:10:43,763
I haven't gotten my term evaluations filed yet.

192
00:10:43,788 --> 00:10:47,538
What? Those are supposed to be
finished before summer vacation starts!

193
00:10:47,953 --> 00:10:49,080
Yeah, I'm sorry.

194
00:10:49,194 --> 00:10:50,971
Geez, what am I gonna do with you?

195
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:53,283
All right, you don't have to come in.

196
00:10:54,108 --> 00:10:56,421
Get your work done so this doesn't happen anymore.

197
00:10:57,548 --> 00:10:58,278
Yes ma'am!

198
00:10:58,684 --> 00:11:01,596
One more thing... the next time
we go out drinking, it's your treat.

199
00:11:01,792 --> 00:11:02,284
Right!

200
00:11:16,793 --> 00:11:17,913
All done!

201
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:21,739
It's a lot later than I thought.

202
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:29,863
Something I enjoy...

203
00:11:30,242 --> 00:11:30,760
well...

204
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:35,609
K.O.!!

205
00:11:36,952 --> 00:11:38,911
You rely too much on the big moves.

206
00:11:39,805 --> 00:11:42,803
And you should really balance your
offense and defense better too...

207
00:11:42,954 --> 00:11:45,895
If your attacks aren't well-defined,
you're better off not making them.

208
00:11:46,633 --> 00:11:47,696
Aren't you?

209
00:11:48,031 --> 00:11:49,614
I used to be really into this game.

210
00:11:49,802 --> 00:11:51,121
You mind switching out with me?

211
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:55,937
Watch this... All you do is just press the start button...

212
00:11:59,481 --> 00:12:00,901
Then hit these like so.

213
00:12:01,377 --> 00:12:02,815
Come on! Bring it!

214
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:04,310
A hidden character?

215
00:12:04,335 --> 00:12:05,083
Cool, huh?

216
00:12:05,113 --> 00:12:07,686
Unfortunately this guy's not all that good, though.

217
00:12:08,871 --> 00:12:10,412
Why are you showing me all this?

218
00:12:10,779 --> 00:12:12,850
Because I enjoy it! The game!

219
00:12:14,702 --> 00:12:15,758
You like it, too...

220
00:12:16,054 --> 00:12:17,928
Don't you wanna know all the secret stuff?

221
00:12:18,255 --> 00:12:20,026
Besides, look at this guy.

222
00:12:20,192 --> 00:12:21,201
He's kinda cute.

223
00:12:22,265 --> 00:12:23,496
Nope, not even a little.

224
00:12:25,158 --> 00:12:26,309
Are you sure about this?

225
00:12:26,334 --> 00:12:27,579
Being Antiskill, and all.

226
00:12:27,717 --> 00:12:28,852
I've got the day off.

227
00:12:29,471 --> 00:12:30,997
My schoolwork is all done, too.

228
00:12:31,363 --> 00:12:34,595
I thought it might be nice to cut
loose and relax for once, you know?

229
00:12:37,377 --> 00:12:40,704
Now then... Let's see if I've
gotten rusty after all these years.

230
00:12:42,377 --> 00:12:43,415
Komoe's calling.

231
00:12:44,661 --> 00:12:46,670
Yes, hello? What?!

232
00:12:46,706 --> 00:12:48,779
There's an emergency involving Yomikawa?

233
00:12:49,136 --> 00:12:50,496
Uh, yes... okay...

234
00:12:50,757 --> 00:12:51,154
but...

235
00:12:52,395 --> 00:12:54,093
Yomikawa needs my help...

236
00:12:54,863 --> 00:12:56,667
I know... but still...

237
00:12:57,334 --> 00:12:58,532
Jamie!

238
00:13:01,103 --> 00:13:03,021
Sorry, would you take over?

239
00:13:04,731 --> 00:13:09,735
Oh! And the Jamie ending is totally
awesome, so make sure you watch it, okay?

240
00:13:17,872 --> 00:13:19,024
All right, I'm here!

241
00:13:21,306 --> 00:13:24,100
Uh oh... I think I drank too much.

242
00:13:24,377 --> 00:13:26,866
This is the emergency that you needed me for?

243
00:13:26,986 --> 00:13:28,493
Yes. Thanks for coming.

244
00:13:30,121 --> 00:13:32,021
Isn't it a little early for this?

245
00:13:32,504 --> 00:13:34,882
Exactly how much did she drink, Komoe?

246
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:37,558
Between the both of us, we had about two gallons.

247
00:13:42,516 --> 00:13:43,445
Hey Tesso...

248
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:45,044
are you enjoying yourself?

249
00:13:47,329 --> 00:13:49,651
How in the world could I be enjoying this?

250
00:13:50,428 --> 00:13:52,470
Well... what about the rest of your day?

251
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:53,384
Huh?

252
00:13:53,873 --> 00:13:54,832
And yesterday?

253
00:13:54,966 --> 00:13:56,159
And the day before that?

254
00:13:57,481 --> 00:13:59,221
Oh... aside from this,

255
00:13:59,246 --> 00:14:01,354
it's been basically enjoyable, I guess...

256
00:14:01,481 --> 00:14:03,441
I mean, I've been busy with work and all...

257
00:14:05,246 --> 00:14:07,853
I make it a point to enjoy myself every day.

258
00:14:09,044 --> 00:14:12,073
With all the different students
in this city, life's never dull.

259
00:14:13,885 --> 00:14:14,576
Yeah.

260
00:14:15,362 --> 00:14:16,950
Just recently, for instance,...

261
00:14:17,092 --> 00:14:19,611
this poor young girl blew the roof off my place.

262
00:14:19,686 --> 00:14:21,463
Huh? She destroyed your roof?

263
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:23,121
Yes, she did.

264
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:24,799
But it's all right.

265
00:14:25,162 --> 00:14:27,492
Because I love every one of my students...

266
00:14:27,709 --> 00:14:29,685
no matter what mistakes they might make...

267
00:14:30,248 --> 00:14:31,429
and what about you, Tesso?

268
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:32,663
What is it that you love?

269
00:14:44,624 --> 00:14:45,473
Right.

270
00:14:48,204 --> 00:14:50,406
Today, we've got areas I through L...

271
00:14:50,579 --> 00:14:51,320
Let's split up, and...

272
00:14:51,345 --> 00:14:52,681
That sounds perfect. I'm on it.

273
00:14:52,706 --> 00:14:54,414
I'll start by patrolling area L.

274
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:58,079
She's pretty fired up today.

275
00:15:01,063 --> 00:15:03,087
Come back here!

276
00:15:04,044 --> 00:15:05,174
Stop there, you!

277
00:15:05,353 --> 00:15:07,336
What kind of automaton monster are you?!

278
00:15:07,363 --> 00:15:07,906
Hey there!

279
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:08,479
Give it back!

280
00:15:08,619 --> 00:15:10,428
Um. What school do you go to?

281
00:15:10,611 --> 00:15:12,223
I'm not a student here...

282
00:15:12,528 --> 00:15:13,606
I'm a holy sister!

283
00:15:14,812 --> 00:15:15,709
Okay, so...

284
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:19,637
What you're saying is you dropped a donut,
and it was picked up by the cleaning robot?

285
00:15:19,716 --> 00:15:22,012
Exactly! And I'm well within my rights.

286
00:15:22,037 --> 00:15:25,321
Toma told me about the regulation you
have known as the "three second rule".

287
00:15:25,532 --> 00:15:28,725
I know what you're talking about, but I
don't think the rule applies on the street.

288
00:15:28,956 --> 00:15:29,448
Ah!

289
00:15:29,994 --> 00:15:32,616
Hey! Give me back my donut this instant!

290
00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:33,596
Oh. Uh, hey wait!

291
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:35,080
O... kay...

292
00:15:36,256 --> 00:15:38,654
Huh? I'm sorry, miss, but...

293
00:15:39,054 --> 00:15:39,903
All of them.

294
00:15:40,763 --> 00:15:41,500
All of them?

295
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:43,788
All of them.

296
00:15:45,127 --> 00:15:46,672
Okay, let me get this straight...

297
00:15:46,793 --> 00:15:50,287
That girl was adamant about buying
all the hamburgers the restaurant had?

298
00:15:52,553 --> 00:15:52,878
Hey.

299
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:55,872
Can you tell me what school you go to?

300
00:15:56,316 --> 00:15:57,597
Kirigaoka Girls'...

301
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,558
But I'm on break right now.

302
00:15:59,789 --> 00:16:00,757
For lunch, right?

303
00:16:01,037 --> 00:16:04,461
And why do you want so many
hamburgers, if you don't mind me asking?

304
00:16:04,486 --> 00:16:05,835
They taste incredible...

305
00:16:06,431 --> 00:16:07,716
I must have them all.

306
00:16:08,115 --> 00:16:09,107
Okay...

307
00:16:09,339 --> 00:16:10,052
Sure...

308
00:16:12,454 --> 00:16:14,228
Maybe this is too much for me...

309
00:16:14,555 --> 00:16:16,396
No! I can't give up now.

310
00:16:16,535 --> 00:16:17,690
Forward, march!

311
00:16:23,246 --> 00:16:24,246
What's the matter?

312
00:16:26,238 --> 00:16:28,984
A special necklace that I had... it's gone.

313
00:16:29,009 --> 00:16:30,037
A lost necklace?

314
00:16:30,288 --> 00:16:31,022
Describe it.

315
00:16:32,156 --> 00:16:33,889
It has a photo inside.

316
00:16:33,996 --> 00:16:35,533
Oh, it's a locket, then.

317
00:16:35,851 --> 00:16:36,835
What's a locket?

318
00:16:36,989 --> 00:16:39,830
That's what you call a necklace
you can put a photo inside of.

319
00:16:41,826 --> 00:16:43,979
What?! Kids don't call it that anymore?

320
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:45,408
It's a necklace.

321
00:16:45,433 --> 00:16:46,592
A necklace. Right...

322
00:16:46,773 --> 00:16:49,000
So, uh... did you lose it around here?

323
00:16:49,387 --> 00:16:50,978
Maybe. Who knows?

324
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,012
Okay. We'll start here.

325
00:16:53,037 --> 00:16:54,220
I'll help you search for it.

326
00:17:01,668 --> 00:17:02,877
Not there either.

327
00:17:05,417 --> 00:17:06,406
Earthquake!

328
00:17:10,942 --> 00:17:12,169
Hey, was that an earthquake?

329
00:17:13,023 --> 00:17:15,471
Huh? Was it...? I didn't notice.

330
00:17:15,496 --> 00:17:17,069
Oh. Never mind then.

331
00:17:20,749 --> 00:17:21,781
I found it.

332
00:17:22,549 --> 00:17:23,289
You did?

333
00:17:23,587 --> 00:17:24,781
That's fantastic!

334
00:17:27,554 --> 00:17:29,226
I'm glad it's not gone for good.

335
00:17:29,938 --> 00:17:33,181
Yeah... Oh, by the way, can you
tell me what school you go t...

336
00:17:39,018 --> 00:17:41,946
What good am I if I can't even
help some girl find her locket...?

337
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:45,004
Is this really the best that I can do?

338
00:17:51,019 --> 00:17:52,495
She sure is late, huh?

339
00:17:52,852 --> 00:17:53,995
What could she be up to?

340
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:10,740
Let's do this!

341
00:18:11,004 --> 00:18:12,534
Huh...? It's another Jamie...

342
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:14,912
All right, you don't stand a chance!

343
00:18:14,937 --> 00:18:15,853
Ready... Go!

344
00:18:21,164 --> 00:18:22,329
This guy's pretty good.

345
00:18:24,011 --> 00:18:24,736
Lariat, huh?!

346
00:18:26,297 --> 00:18:27,283
K.O.!!

347
00:18:29,537 --> 00:18:30,717
Round 2.

348
00:18:35,795 --> 00:18:36,708
Yeah, take that!

349
00:18:36,742 --> 00:18:39,069
They didn't used to call me Jamie's Empress for nothing!

350
00:18:42,183 --> 00:18:43,025
K.O.!!

351
00:18:43,579 --> 00:18:45,766
I did it...! We're even!

352
00:18:46,596 --> 00:18:47,601
Final round!

353
00:18:48,268 --> 00:18:49,554
I'm gonna take this match.

354
00:18:49,579 --> 00:18:50,429
Just watch!

355
00:18:53,323 --> 00:18:53,916
Got 'im!

356
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:58,787
Time to say goodbye!

357
00:19:04,238 --> 00:19:05,188
K.O.!!

358
00:19:07,481 --> 00:19:08,440
You lose.

359
00:19:12,236 --> 00:19:14,661
I guess I have gotten rusty, after all.

360
00:19:18,341 --> 00:19:19,111
Oh, well...

361
00:19:19,535 --> 00:19:21,493
For a while there, I was on fire.

362
00:19:23,387 --> 00:19:24,989
Jamie's Empress, is it?

363
00:19:25,954 --> 00:19:27,516
What? Oh, no! You heard that?

364
00:19:31,318 --> 00:19:32,154
No kidding?

365
00:19:32,194 --> 00:19:35,412
You really did what I said and
played until you saw Jamie's ending?

366
00:19:35,496 --> 00:19:36,915
No wonder you're so good.

367
00:19:37,994 --> 00:19:41,325
Aw, man, I really wish they
would come out with a Gekisho 10.

368
00:19:41,391 --> 00:19:43,627
They never will not with an old game like that.

369
00:19:43,894 --> 00:19:46,551
Well, if they do, I have no doubt I'll beat you on it.

370
00:19:50,204 --> 00:19:50,746
What?

371
00:19:51,673 --> 00:19:52,178
Nothing.

372
00:19:54,204 --> 00:19:55,395
I'll look forward to it...

373
00:19:55,887 --> 00:19:57,637
Your Imperial Majesty.

374
00:19:58,106 --> 00:20:00,099
Didn't I tell you to forget you heard that?

375
00:20:06,169 --> 00:20:07,306
You can just leave me here.

376
00:20:07,576 --> 00:20:08,787
What are you talking about?

377
00:20:08,926 --> 00:20:10,179
It's past curfew...

378
00:20:10,204 --> 00:20:12,159
A middle-schooler can't be out on his own.

379
00:20:12,342 --> 00:20:14,209
It's okay. My place is right over there.

380
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:15,375
Oh...

381
00:20:16,287 --> 00:20:16,783
Bye.

382
00:20:20,303 --> 00:20:20,853
Um...

383
00:20:23,001 --> 00:20:23,750
Thanks a lot.

384
00:20:32,538 --> 00:20:32,860
Yes?

385
00:20:32,884 --> 00:20:33,418
Where are you?!

386
00:20:33,443 --> 00:20:34,310
You didn't even call!

387
00:20:34,613 --> 00:20:37,097
If you're not coming, the least you can do is let us know!

388
00:20:37,431 --> 00:20:39,370
Yomikawa worries about you, Tesso.

389
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,683
Well, I wouldn't say "worry," exactly...

390
00:20:42,582 --> 00:20:44,463
Anyway... remember what I told you.

391
00:20:44,488 --> 00:20:44,806
It's your turn to buy!

392
00:20:44,831 --> 00:20:45,554
All right, Pops...

393
00:20:45,747 --> 00:20:47,666
Today I'll take the entire pig's head!

394
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:48,126
Here ya go!

395
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:49,929
You'd better hurry up and get down here!

396
00:20:49,954 --> 00:20:51,852
Yes, ma'am! Coming!

397
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:56,562
He transferred?

398
00:20:57,167 --> 00:20:58,064
That's what we heard.

399
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:01,244
It does seem strange, going in
the middle of summer vacation.

400
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:02,141
You're right...

401
00:21:02,596 --> 00:21:03,506
It does.

402
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:05,604
The school he's transferring to.

403
00:21:05,629 --> 00:21:06,629
What was it called, again?

404
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:08,695
Zasso Academy Junior High.

405
00:21:09,154 --> 00:21:10,946
I don't recognize the name at all.

406
00:21:11,269 --> 00:21:12,346
I think I'd remember it.

407
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:14,221
Zasso is a weird name for a school.

408
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:15,377
Here's the thing...

409
00:21:15,591 --> 00:21:17,474
Zasso is a game-making company.

410
00:21:18,613 --> 00:21:21,288
They're the ones who established
the school in the first place.

411
00:21:21,725 --> 00:21:22,860
They make games?

412
00:21:23,012 --> 00:21:26,593
Yeah, they're famous for those Gekisho
games that were real popular a while back.

413
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:28,874
Oh... I think I have heard of those.

414
00:21:29,992 --> 00:21:33,554
So then, is the whole purpose of the
school to train future game creators?

415
00:21:33,769 --> 00:21:37,424
From what I've heard, the real technical
stuff doesn't start until the high-school level...

416
00:21:37,568 --> 00:21:39,347
I wonder why he picked Zasso, though...

417
00:21:39,744 --> 00:21:41,332
I mean, they're kinda washed up.

418
00:21:41,357 --> 00:21:42,496
Are they really?

419
00:21:42,778 --> 00:21:43,804
That surprises me...

420
00:21:43,829 --> 00:21:45,575
They made some of my favorite games.

421
00:21:45,718 --> 00:21:47,629
Yes, but you're a big dork, Uiharu.

422
00:21:47,704 --> 00:21:49,912
What is it, Tesso? You're acting strangely.

423
00:21:50,178 --> 00:21:51,056
Oh, nothing.

424
00:21:56,207 --> 00:21:57,016
All right...

425
00:21:57,291 --> 00:21:59,804
I expect all of you to get back home before curfew!

426
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:00,653
Right!

427
00:22:05,754 --> 00:22:06,494
Yes!

428
00:22:06,777 --> 00:22:08,068
I'll do my best!

429
00:22:08,242 --> 00:22:09,441
What's come over you today?

430
00:22:09,466 --> 00:22:11,991
Come on, let's go! Area E is next, right?

431
00:22:12,016 --> 00:22:12,930
No, it's F.

432
00:22:12,955 --> 00:22:14,614
Oh, is it? All right, then!

433
00:23:30,544 --> 00:23:34,343
When I was a little girl, my mom
always told me "Drink before you speak."

434
00:23:34,476 --> 00:23:36,647
Wait, that wasn't it... "Think before you speak?"

435
00:23:36,901 --> 00:23:38,163
"Drink before you leap?"

436
00:23:38,324 --> 00:23:39,476
W... Whatever...
