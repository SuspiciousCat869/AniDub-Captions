1
00:00:01,444 --> 00:00:03,134
You understand nothing!

2
00:00:03,977 --> 00:00:05,937
I would do anything to save them.

3
00:00:06,021 --> 00:00:08,214
Anything in the entire world!

4
00:00:08,447 --> 00:00:13,473
The whole city can hate and revile me. I don't
care! I'm not going to let anything stop me now!

5
00:00:18,134 --> 00:00:19,846
Hey... what's wrong?

6
00:00:20,517 --> 00:00:22,175
Oh, gosh... what's that?

7
00:00:24,571 --> 00:00:25,520
A fetus...?

8
00:02:13,221 --> 00:02:16,125
It's no use. Every single camera has gone dead.

9
00:02:16,762 --> 00:02:18,540
My phone's not going through, either.

10
00:02:23,229 --> 00:02:24,045
Kuroko!

11
00:02:24,782 --> 00:02:27,096
I can't just leave Sissy alone out there!

12
00:02:28,228 --> 00:02:30,426
How can you help her with all these injuries?

13
00:02:30,547 --> 00:02:31,275
Well, I...

14
00:02:31,452 --> 00:02:33,238
You need to have more faith in Misaka.

15
00:02:33,263 --> 00:02:34,585
I'm sure she can handle it.

16
00:02:40,485 --> 00:02:41,364
A fetus...?

17
00:02:43,554 --> 00:02:45,166
Is this the "Metamorphose" skill?

18
00:02:45,804 --> 00:02:46,849
I've heard about it.

19
00:02:47,303 --> 00:02:48,351
I guess it's real.

20
00:03:08,033 --> 00:03:08,779
This is bad...

21
00:03:09,054 --> 00:03:10,025
It's getting bigger.

22
00:03:21,437 --> 00:03:22,473
Hurry, Misaka!

23
00:03:22,887 --> 00:03:24,470
Why are you here, Uiharu?!

24
00:03:33,437 --> 00:03:34,898
Uiharu! You okay?

25
00:03:36,096 --> 00:03:37,341
Yes... I'm fine.

26
00:03:37,366 --> 00:03:37,851
You're lucky.

27
00:03:38,168 --> 00:03:39,567
You shouldn't have come down here!

28
00:03:40,133 --> 00:03:41,553
Yeah... I'm sorry.

29
00:03:41,967 --> 00:03:42,433
But, I...

30
00:03:42,754 --> 00:03:43,675
Just stay there.

31
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,995
I'm not sure what this thing is,

32
00:03:46,425 --> 00:03:48,211
but if it wants a fight, it can have one.

33
00:03:50,346 --> 00:03:51,499
It's not after me.

34
00:03:52,204 --> 00:03:54,367
What, then? Is it just on a random rampage?

35
00:03:55,887 --> 00:03:56,484
Look at it.

36
00:03:57,549 --> 00:03:59,757
It's almost like it's in pain or something.

37
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:06,776
What's happening?

38
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:07,781
The patients!

39
00:04:07,988 --> 00:04:09,696
They all suddenly started going berserk.

40
00:04:09,721 --> 00:04:10,807
We don't know why!

41
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:12,548
Have they regained consciousness?

42
00:04:12,603 --> 00:04:15,494
No... They were in the same comatose state as usual.

43
00:04:15,723 --> 00:04:16,301
And then, this.

44
00:04:16,325 --> 00:04:17,488
All at the same time?

45
00:04:19,316 --> 00:04:20,554
As if on cue...

46
00:04:20,979 --> 00:04:22,938
They're all exhibiting the same symptoms...

47
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:28,118
They haven't regained consciousness, it's more
like they're all experiencing the same horrible dream.

48
00:04:28,841 --> 00:04:29,794
Good grief!

49
00:04:30,168 --> 00:04:31,889
What the hell is going on?

50
00:04:41,379 --> 00:04:42,904
Hey, what is that thing?

51
00:04:43,084 --> 00:04:44,000
A monster?

52
00:04:44,122 --> 00:04:45,953
Some new kind of bio-weapon?

53
00:04:46,396 --> 00:04:48,789
We'll have to do what we can with the men we have left.

54
00:04:49,158 --> 00:04:51,188
Use of live ammo is authorized...

55
00:04:51,577 --> 00:04:52,188
Fire!

56
00:05:02,554 --> 00:05:02,972
Look...!

57
00:05:03,496 --> 00:05:05,512
I think... it's getting bigger!

58
00:05:16,387 --> 00:05:17,375
How incredible.

59
00:05:17,767 --> 00:05:20,457
Who would've thought something
like that could ever be created?

60
00:05:21,164 --> 00:05:24,063
I can just imagine the recognition I'll get from academia.

61
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,789
The network is utterly out of my hands at this point.

62
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:28,995
That's it...

63
00:05:29,347 --> 00:05:33,166
I no longer have any hope of bringing
back all those children I helped to destroy...

64
00:05:35,131 --> 00:05:36,436
They're lost forever.

65
00:05:37,099 --> 00:05:38,880
Please! You can't give up now!

66
00:05:50,512 --> 00:05:52,387
Is that an AIM diffusion field?

67
00:05:52,888 --> 00:05:54,707
It's most likely a collection of them...

68
00:05:55,119 --> 00:05:56,159
Yes, that's it...

69
00:05:56,442 --> 00:05:59,878
Although I think it would be more
appropriate to call it an AIM burst.

70
00:06:00,707 --> 00:06:03,548
The AIM diffusion fields of ten thousand people...

71
00:06:03,854 --> 00:06:06,520
all bundled up together within the Level Upper network.

72
00:06:07,372 --> 00:06:11,276
They acted as the catalyst to bring to
life a monster of latent consciousness.

73
00:06:13,096 --> 00:06:14,149
Simply stated...

74
00:06:14,619 --> 00:06:18,047
That thing up there is a collection
of ten thousand children's thoughts.

75
00:06:25,804 --> 00:06:27,012
Academy City.

76
00:06:27,627 --> 00:06:29,694
All my dreams were going to come true here.

77
00:06:30,387 --> 00:06:32,239
I was going to be a powerful Esper.

78
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:34,358
But now...

79
00:06:37,668 --> 00:06:39,501
My dreams have become a nightmare.

80
00:06:43,093 --> 00:06:44,949
It doesn't matter how hard I try...

81
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:48,371
In this city, if you have no talent, you have no power.

82
00:06:49,414 --> 00:06:52,147
So I'm stuck with my miserable, ordinary life.

83
00:06:52,408 --> 00:06:57,179
A life where every day means being beaten
down, taken advantage of, or simply ignored.

84
00:06:59,429 --> 00:07:00,648
So what can I do?

85
00:07:01,849 --> 00:07:04,137
I have no choice but to get my hands on it.

86
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:06,424
I can't keep living like this!

87
00:07:06,756 --> 00:07:08,923
I'm so tired of being powerless.

88
00:07:22,314 --> 00:07:24,266
In a way... I pity it.

89
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,607
What now? How do we go about stopping it?

90
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:31,602
You're asking me that question?

91
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:33,533
It makes no difference what I say...

92
00:07:33,764 --> 00:07:34,970
You'll never trust me.

93
00:07:37,221 --> 00:07:38,412
Then what about this?

94
00:07:38,454 --> 00:07:40,858
You're the one who took my handcuffs off, aren't you?

95
00:07:44,049 --> 00:07:45,435
That doesn't mean anything.

96
00:07:45,934 --> 00:07:48,226
You can't possibly trust me just because of that.

97
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:51,385
That's not all.

98
00:07:55,789 --> 00:07:59,054
I know you're sincere about wanting
to help bring those children back.

99
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:00,761
I can hear it in your voice.

100
00:08:02,096 --> 00:08:03,009
I trust you.

101
00:08:04,086 --> 00:08:05,980
I completely trust you, Teacher.

102
00:08:08,527 --> 00:08:09,546
You heard it, too?

103
00:08:13,604 --> 00:08:14,592
There might be a way.

104
00:08:16,802 --> 00:08:17,570
Think about it...

105
00:08:17,942 --> 00:08:21,433
The AIM burst is a monster
created by the Level Upper network...

106
00:08:21,971 --> 00:08:24,666
If the network were brought
down somehow, that might stop it.

107
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,705
The Level Upper treatment program!

108
00:08:29,418 --> 00:08:31,715
It might not work but it's worth a shot at least.

109
00:08:39,177 --> 00:08:40,858
I'll find a way to handle that thing.

110
00:08:41,912 --> 00:08:45,450
While I'm doing that, You get that
chip and whatever's on it to Antiskill.

111
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:48,017
Right, let's do it!

112
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:54,032
Incredible...

113
00:08:55,057 --> 00:08:58,679
There are still people out there who
are willing to trust without any reason to.

114
00:09:02,437 --> 00:09:03,122
Captain!

115
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,843
No... No!

116
00:09:06,387 --> 00:09:08,355
No! Stay away!

117
00:09:27,593 --> 00:09:29,196
What were you just standing there for?

118
00:09:29,221 --> 00:09:30,818
That monster could've killed you!

119
00:09:31,042 --> 00:09:32,717
Uh... who are you?

120
00:09:33,481 --> 00:09:36,306
A civilian shouldn't be here! It's too dangerous!

121
00:09:36,574 --> 00:09:37,409
Geez...

122
00:09:37,616 --> 00:09:40,889
Everybody just has to call me a
civilian. It's starting to get old.

123
00:09:41,257 --> 00:09:43,733
Whatever, just get away from here right now!

124
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:49,449
You're the one who should get going.

125
00:09:49,607 --> 00:09:52,498
That thing won't come this way unless
you provoke it with more shooting.

126
00:09:52,965 --> 00:09:53,857
Even so...

127
00:09:54,977 --> 00:09:57,503
We can't just stand down and do nothing either.

128
00:09:58,445 --> 00:09:59,950
Do you know what that is over there?

129
00:10:00,512 --> 00:10:02,778
An experimental nuclear reactor.

130
00:10:03,667 --> 00:10:04,207
What?!

131
00:10:04,706 --> 00:10:06,640
Hey, what's that girl doing?

132
00:10:08,071 --> 00:10:08,801
That's her!

133
00:10:09,351 --> 00:10:11,066
The girl Kiyama held hostage.

134
00:10:12,389 --> 00:10:14,514
She sure is taking her time getting away.

135
00:10:14,636 --> 00:10:15,426
She's not.

136
00:10:16,572 --> 00:10:20,179
Uiharu's not being held against her
will anymore, and she's not getting away.

137
00:10:22,198 --> 00:10:23,489
I need to ask a favor.

138
00:10:34,123 --> 00:10:36,078
From now on, you're going to be facing me.

139
00:10:39,454 --> 00:10:40,160
Geez...!

140
00:10:40,351 --> 00:10:42,126
You're not going to make this easy, are you?

141
00:10:44,596 --> 00:10:45,181
No!

142
00:10:56,304 --> 00:10:58,093
Thank goodness! It's not broken.

143
00:10:59,198 --> 00:11:00,380
I have to hurry...

144
00:11:01,025 --> 00:11:02,900
Or it will be too late for everyone.

145
00:11:04,803 --> 00:11:05,886
I can do this...

146
00:11:06,176 --> 00:11:07,920
I'm a member of Judgment.

147
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:09,803
For them.

148
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,859
And for Saten!

149
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,475
You okay?

150
00:11:19,912 --> 00:11:20,754
Honestly!

151
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:23,168
You kids these days do the craziest things.

152
00:11:23,387 --> 00:11:24,971
Do you have the treatment program?

153
00:11:25,637 --> 00:11:26,527
Yes, it's safe.

154
00:11:27,029 --> 00:11:27,916
We'll cover you...

155
00:11:28,251 --> 00:11:28,745
Hurry!

156
00:11:29,836 --> 00:11:31,453
Damn! Another one.

157
00:11:34,363 --> 00:11:35,958
Didn't you hear what I told you?

158
00:11:36,968 --> 00:11:38,821
I said, you're going to face me.

159
00:11:38,846 --> 00:11:40,281
I'm your biggest problem now.

160
00:11:40,654 --> 00:11:42,833
So stop just standing there, looking all creepy...

161
00:11:43,888 --> 00:11:46,230
Go on, make a move! Come after me, already!

162
00:11:52,266 --> 00:11:55,266
By broadcasting the vaccine file throughout Academy City,

163
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,456
you will bring down the Level Upper network.

164
00:11:59,814 --> 00:12:01,899
If the flower-haired girl can manage that,

165
00:12:02,249 --> 00:12:05,578
It should succeed in bringing the
runaway AIM burst under control...

166
00:12:06,294 --> 00:12:06,888
However...

167
00:12:19,782 --> 00:12:21,964
It's starting to feel like this could go on forever.

168
00:12:22,613 --> 00:12:23,274
Sheesh!

169
00:12:23,813 --> 00:12:26,562
What do you want with a nuclear power facility anyway?

170
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:29,001
This is straight out of a monster movie!

171
00:12:34,915 --> 00:12:35,669
Oh, yeah?

172
00:12:36,587 --> 00:12:39,171
A collection of ten thousand children's thoughts...

173
00:12:54,054 --> 00:12:54,665
Oh, no!

174
00:12:57,591 --> 00:12:58,532
Yes, that's right.

175
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:00,227
We're out of time.

176
00:13:00,252 --> 00:13:04,179
Take the file I'm sending and broadcast it
by all means possible throughout the city!

177
00:13:04,204 --> 00:13:05,871
All right. The transfer is complete!

178
00:13:07,331 --> 00:13:08,757
I'll take responsibility.

179
00:13:09,102 --> 00:13:10,268
Just play it right now!

180
00:13:27,699 --> 00:13:28,545
What is that?

181
00:13:29,014 --> 00:13:30,972
Doctor! Look at the patients!

182
00:13:38,096 --> 00:13:42,221
Whatever I have to do, I absolutely
cannot allow it to come any closer than this.

183
00:13:45,228 --> 00:13:45,923
Music?

184
00:13:46,351 --> 00:13:47,267
What is that?

185
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,420
Crap!

186
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:58,286
It won't matter how many times I
hit it if it just keeps regenerating.

187
00:13:59,956 --> 00:14:01,051
It's not growing back.

188
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:04,148
That music must be the treatment program!

189
00:14:04,347 --> 00:14:05,555
You did it, Uiharu!

190
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:14,000
Sorry about this... but it's game over for you now!

191
00:14:30,518 --> 00:14:32,112
That was a closer fight than I like.

192
00:14:32,137 --> 00:14:33,092
Don't relax.

193
00:14:33,445 --> 00:14:34,703
This isn't over yet!

194
00:14:34,805 --> 00:14:37,095
Hey! What do you think you're doing here?

195
00:14:38,421 --> 00:14:39,305
No way!

196
00:14:39,836 --> 00:14:41,419
The network may have been disrupted,

197
00:14:41,444 --> 00:14:46,488
but remember, that's a mass of ten thousand
people's thoughts, created by AIM diffusion fields.

198
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:49,196
You can't think about it like an ordinary creature.

199
00:14:49,309 --> 00:14:50,890
This isn't what we bargained for.

200
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:52,900
What am I supposed to do, huh?

201
00:14:53,368 --> 00:14:54,329
The nucleus!

202
00:14:55,158 --> 00:14:58,827
There has to be a nucleus where the
fields have become embedded somewhere inside.

203
00:14:59,633 --> 00:15:00,440
That's the key!

204
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:02,190
Find a way to destroy it.

205
00:15:02,404 --> 00:15:03,252
Is that it?

206
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:05,434
Was that Saten?

207
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:08,462
Are Level Zeroes permanently defective?

208
00:15:08,721 --> 00:15:09,893
That's what they think.

209
00:15:10,455 --> 00:15:11,536
I can't stand it.

210
00:15:12,069 --> 00:15:13,109
It's hopeless...

211
00:15:13,637 --> 00:15:14,619
As a Level Zero...

212
00:15:14,644 --> 00:15:15,350
What's happening?

213
00:15:16,464 --> 00:15:17,649
You probably...

214
00:15:18,181 --> 00:15:19,514
wouldn't understand...

215
00:15:19,808 --> 00:15:21,988
how miserable every day is for us.

216
00:15:22,344 --> 00:15:24,886
You come here with so many expectations, and then,

217
00:15:25,128 --> 00:15:25,870
nothing.

218
00:15:27,905 --> 00:15:28,953
Stand back now...

219
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,772
Where you are, you might get hit.

220
00:15:30,904 --> 00:15:31,796
What do I care?

221
00:15:32,244 --> 00:15:33,946
I'm responsible for creating that creature...

222
00:15:33,986 --> 00:15:35,023
Maybe you don't care.

223
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,778
But what about the students you taught?

224
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:40,919
Once we save them, don't you think
it's your face they're gonna want to see?

225
00:15:42,676 --> 00:15:45,987
I'll help you save the children...
but I won't help you die...

226
00:15:46,778 --> 00:15:48,442
You shouldn't give up so easily.

227
00:15:49,347 --> 00:15:49,942
Got it?

228
00:15:54,801 --> 00:15:56,696
I don't want you tangled up in that thing.

229
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:00,321
I'm the one who's going to tangle with it...

230
00:16:00,346 --> 00:16:01,556
Right about now!

231
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:04,675
Incredible...

232
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:07,797
Is that the same kind of
induction field I was using before?

233
00:16:08,119 --> 00:16:09,439
With power like hers...

234
00:16:09,776 --> 00:16:11,108
maybe this will work.

235
00:16:16,585 --> 00:16:18,325
The lightning isn't hitting it directly.

236
00:16:19,364 --> 00:16:23,581
But the heat from the electrical impedance
she's forcing on it is blasting its body away.

237
00:16:25,487 --> 00:16:29,012
When she was fighting me earlier...
that wasn't her full power at all.

238
00:16:39,268 --> 00:16:40,116
Forgive me...

239
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:46,113
Anyone... would want to be... an Esper...

240
00:16:47,341 --> 00:16:49,196
I should have realized so much sooner.

241
00:16:50,318 --> 00:16:51,637
What's the use anymore?

242
00:16:51,945 --> 00:16:53,337
I'll always be nothing.

243
00:16:53,803 --> 00:16:54,828
There's no point.

244
00:16:57,968 --> 00:16:59,739
I know how hard you were trying.

245
00:17:01,069 --> 00:17:03,345
I was so tired of not having any power...

246
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:07,643
And finally, it didn't matter anymore
what lengths I had to go to to get it.

247
00:17:08,762 --> 00:17:09,677
I understand.

248
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:13,061
But this doesn't have to be it. You can keep trying.

249
00:17:16,182 --> 00:17:18,577
Don't stay here and let yourself be defeated.

250
00:17:20,137 --> 00:17:21,554
You are not defective.

251
00:17:21,637 --> 00:17:23,089
There's nothing wrong with you.

252
00:17:23,637 --> 00:17:25,144
So... don't give up!

253
00:17:36,735 --> 00:17:37,777
So that's it...

254
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:41,243
That's a Level 5.

255
00:17:51,684 --> 00:17:53,502
It... worked.

256
00:18:11,536 --> 00:18:15,182
Inspection of experimental reactor
core and surrounding area is complete.

257
00:18:16,691 --> 00:18:18,107
Nothing out of the ordinary.

258
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:19,030
Roger.

259
00:18:19,763 --> 00:18:22,913
Do an additional sweep to make
sure no one was injured in the area.

260
00:18:28,314 --> 00:18:29,061
Wait... uh...

261
00:18:30,837 --> 00:18:31,638
What now?

262
00:18:32,054 --> 00:18:32,932
What do we do?

263
00:18:33,107 --> 00:18:34,482
About the children, I mean.

264
00:18:37,628 --> 00:18:39,454
I have no intention of giving up.

265
00:18:40,346 --> 00:18:41,814
I'll just have to try again.

266
00:18:43,423 --> 00:18:46,241
It doesn't matter whether I'm
in a laboratory or a prison cell.

267
00:18:47,587 --> 00:18:50,046
They can lock me up but they can't stop me from planning.

268
00:18:51,716 --> 00:18:52,286
However...

269
00:18:53,468 --> 00:18:55,864
I'm still not going to be choosy about my methods.

270
00:18:57,252 --> 00:19:00,620
If you don't like the plan I come up
with, you'll have to come and stop me again.

271
00:19:06,221 --> 00:19:06,936
Good grief.

272
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,264
She's never gonna learn, is she?

273
00:19:11,898 --> 00:19:12,635
Sissy! Sissy!

274
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:13,422
Oh... Kuroko...

275
00:19:13,446 --> 00:19:14,097
Sissy!!

276
00:19:16,487 --> 00:19:19,141
I was worried about you! My
heart was aching the whole time...!

277
00:19:19,643 --> 00:19:23,179
And look at you: Hair messed up,
scrapes and bruises all over your skin!

278
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,134
And I'm guessing you don't have
the strength left to shock, either...

279
00:19:28,159 --> 00:19:33,519
I think I'll take this time to examine every inch of your
body for injuries and rub the soreness from your limbs.

280
00:19:33,732 --> 00:19:35,062
Oh, I almost forgot.

281
00:19:35,929 --> 00:19:38,589
I received a message from the hospital with good news.

282
00:19:39,395 --> 00:19:43,658
It looks like all the people who used the
Level Upper are beginning to regain consciousness.

283
00:19:44,509 --> 00:19:46,194
And we have you to thank for that...

284
00:19:46,641 --> 00:19:47,313
Good job.

285
00:19:49,126 --> 00:19:52,072
Now then, Sissy, let's pick up where we left off.

286
00:19:52,147 --> 00:19:53,654
What are you doing? Knock it off!

287
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,758
I swear, if you don't stop this second...

288
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:14,667
There you are!

289
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:22,565
Oh, hey, Uiharu!

290
00:20:24,488 --> 00:20:26,944
Don't "oh, hey" me! I've been looking everywhere for you!

291
00:20:26,969 --> 00:20:28,130
Why aren't you in your room?

292
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:31,096
Are you sure you should be out of bed so
soon? There could still be something wrong.

293
00:20:31,121 --> 00:20:32,512
You were in a coma!

294
00:20:34,046 --> 00:20:35,801
I just took a long nap, that's all...

295
00:20:35,892 --> 00:20:39,942
I'm totally back to normal now.
Including not having any kind of ability.

296
00:20:55,751 --> 00:20:56,460
What is it?

297
00:20:58,222 --> 00:20:59,039
I'm sorry...

298
00:20:59,698 --> 00:21:01,622
for getting hung up on stupid stuff...

299
00:21:02,282 --> 00:21:03,934
and for keeping secrets from you...

300
00:21:04,785 --> 00:21:06,588
and for putting you through all of this.

301
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:09,090
You don't have to...

302
00:21:10,661 --> 00:21:11,441
But I am...

303
00:21:11,857 --> 00:21:13,046
I came so close...

304
00:21:13,349 --> 00:21:17,510
So close to losing something far more
important to me than some stupid ability.

305
00:21:22,351 --> 00:21:23,113
Oh, yeah...

306
00:21:24,709 --> 00:21:25,829
I almost forgot.

307
00:21:26,891 --> 00:21:28,832
I'm back!!

308
00:21:34,175 --> 00:21:37,262
What did you do that for? Get back to your bed right now!

309
00:21:37,363 --> 00:21:39,654
I was just thanking you for taking care of me!

310
00:21:39,737 --> 00:21:42,554
Though, I think you should know,
even your panties are covered in mud.

311
00:21:42,579 --> 00:21:44,724
That settles it. Things are officially back to normal.

312
00:21:45,362 --> 00:21:46,529
How can you say that?

313
00:21:46,554 --> 00:21:48,976
After everything I've done,
you're insulting my underwear?!

314
00:21:49,001 --> 00:21:50,206
Is something bothering you?

315
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:52,287
Huh...? No, it's nothing.

316
00:21:56,444 --> 00:22:00,383
"Can we really blame the people who used the
Level Upper for making the choice they did?"

317
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:05,317
"Maybe we're responsible for all of this; We
Espers, who didn't realize how much pain they were in,

318
00:22:05,342 --> 00:22:07,818
how hard it must be to live here and not have an ability."

319
00:22:08,988 --> 00:22:11,983
That's what you were thinking, or
something along those lines. Am I right?

320
00:22:13,286 --> 00:22:14,254
Don't mimic me...

321
00:22:14,443 --> 00:22:15,263
It's creepy.

322
00:22:16,012 --> 00:22:18,321
That kind of compassion is just like you, Sissy.

323
00:22:20,216 --> 00:22:24,375
And while we're on the topic of compassion, there's
one other thing I wish you would give some thought to...

324
00:22:24,756 --> 00:22:25,687
and that is...

325
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:27,928
My feelings!

326
00:22:27,953 --> 00:22:29,953
I deserve some love too, don't I?

327
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:32,243
I should thank you, Kuroko...

328
00:22:32,415 --> 00:22:37,016
Your unrelentingly, unapologetically perverted
nature is giving me some of my strength back.

329
00:22:37,666 --> 00:22:38,666
I'm serious here, Saten!

330
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:39,538
You are gonna get it...

331
00:22:43,533 --> 00:22:44,862
Careful, Misaka!

332
00:22:44,887 --> 00:22:46,981
Oh, dear! Shirai, are you all right?

333
00:22:47,251 --> 00:22:48,731
Some things never change, huh?

334
00:23:30,634 --> 00:23:33,279
After all we just went through,
isn't this kind of a cheap thing to do?

335
00:23:33,304 --> 00:23:34,304
What are you talking about?

336
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:35,637
A swimsuit episode is perfect.

337
00:23:35,662 --> 00:23:37,196
Here, tell me which one you like better...

338
00:23:37,269 --> 00:23:37,956
Sissy, look!

339
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,253
I don't want to!
