1
00:00:04,378 --> 00:00:07,066
Hot, hot, it is so hot in here.

2
00:00:10,528 --> 00:00:11,674
Come on, wake up...!

3
00:00:12,006 --> 00:00:13,526
Please, open your eyes, Sissy!

4
00:00:13,696 --> 00:00:14,605
Sissy!

5
00:00:15,028 --> 00:00:16,307
Wake up already...

6
00:00:18,774 --> 00:00:21,285
Okay, well maybe a kiss will help, then...

7
00:00:25,666 --> 00:00:27,514
This isn't a fairy tale, ya know.

8
00:00:27,703 --> 00:00:30,121
But it did work. You're awake now, aren't you?

9
00:00:30,254 --> 00:00:31,466
That's unexpected...

10
00:00:31,557 --> 00:00:33,156
Why are you two still here?

11
00:00:33,402 --> 00:00:35,731
Yeah, well, there's something we needed to ask you.

12
00:02:06,956 --> 00:02:09,318
I find it unbelievably hot in here...

13
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,688
It's the middle of summer.

14
00:02:11,713 --> 00:02:14,062
Shouldn't they at least turn
on the air conditioning for us?

15
00:02:14,087 --> 00:02:15,609
You do make a good point.

16
00:02:16,216 --> 00:02:18,906
I'm very sorry, but we had a power outage last night.

17
00:02:18,931 --> 00:02:21,098
Things haven't been restored to normal quite yet.

18
00:02:23,419 --> 00:02:24,404
All right, then...

19
00:02:24,429 --> 00:02:28,529
They're using emergency power for
basic operations and critical patients.

20
00:02:32,396 --> 00:02:33,954
Again, seriously?!

21
00:02:34,065 --> 00:02:36,690
Your solution to this is to take off all your clothing?!

22
00:02:36,853 --> 00:02:39,403
Well... it's really hot in here, y'know?

23
00:02:39,428 --> 00:02:41,859
We're not alone. There are people everywhere!

24
00:02:42,001 --> 00:02:43,876
What if I just leave my underwear on?

25
00:02:44,088 --> 00:02:45,588
No, not going to work.

26
00:02:45,934 --> 00:02:46,523
Alright.

27
00:02:46,608 --> 00:02:51,719
Dr. Kiyama, we're really interested in
your opinion on these patients as a specialist.

28
00:02:51,976 --> 00:02:53,366
I'd be happy to help you...

29
00:02:53,952 --> 00:02:55,655
but it's so hot in here.

30
00:03:01,461 --> 00:03:03,529
Saten's running really late.

31
00:03:04,399 --> 00:03:06,538
Got on the blue stripes today, huh?

32
00:03:10,867 --> 00:03:13,362
In your email you said you wanted to show me something.

33
00:03:15,202 --> 00:03:17,232
That's right, and I can't wait anymore.

34
00:03:18,744 --> 00:03:20,597
This thing is so incredible.

35
00:03:21,252 --> 00:03:24,770
I've finally found the elusive
item we've all been looking for!

36
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:27,135
Ta... da!

37
00:03:30,188 --> 00:03:32,521
That just looks like a music player to me.

38
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:34,661
It's what's on it that really matters.

39
00:03:35,463 --> 00:03:37,617
Just wait... I'll show you later, okay?

40
00:03:39,602 --> 00:03:41,715
Now, I'd like to pick up where we left off,

41
00:03:41,796 --> 00:03:42,596
if it's okay...

42
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:45,521
Why are swimsuits acceptable and underwear is not,

43
00:03:45,679 --> 00:03:47,587
when both expose the same amount of skin?

44
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:49,723
No.... that isn't the point.

45
00:03:50,633 --> 00:03:52,064
This "Level Upper"?

46
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:55,545
Can you tell me what kind of thing it is, exactly?

47
00:03:55,849 --> 00:03:56,783
What does it do...?

48
00:03:57,213 --> 00:03:58,151
How is it used?

49
00:03:59,213 --> 00:04:00,947
Unfortunately, we don't know.

50
00:04:01,722 --> 00:04:03,181
No details so far...

51
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:07,557
but it might have something to do with the
students who have fallen into comas recently.

52
00:04:08,411 --> 00:04:09,814
That's what you think, yes?

53
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:10,933
Right.

54
00:04:11,531 --> 00:04:14,142
So... why bring this problem to me?

55
00:04:14,664 --> 00:04:17,478
Well, I've been giving this some serious thought lately...

56
00:04:17,702 --> 00:04:21,826
It seems that elevating one's ability
might well disrupt normal brain function.

57
00:04:22,734 --> 00:04:23,979
If that's the case...

58
00:04:24,004 --> 00:04:26,260
I think we'll need help when we find this thing...

59
00:04:26,498 --> 00:04:29,660
and I feel that your professional
experience could be invaluable.

60
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:34,714
This is something I would be happy to help with.

61
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,992
I am a cerebrophysiologist...

62
00:04:38,046 --> 00:04:39,123
it's my area...

63
00:04:39,789 --> 00:04:40,765
Aside from that...

64
00:04:41,017 --> 00:04:43,589
there is something else that's been bothering me.

65
00:04:44,921 --> 00:04:46,338
Who are those girls?

66
00:04:47,848 --> 00:04:50,201
Oh... so you're a brain doctor?

67
00:04:50,871 --> 00:04:52,912
Are you here to look at Shirai's brain?!

68
00:04:53,713 --> 00:04:56,421
We are conferring with her about the Level Upper matter.

69
00:04:57,551 --> 00:04:59,213
Well, if that's the case...

70
00:04:59,372 --> 00:05:00,911
This is pretty serious...

71
00:05:01,088 --> 00:05:04,214
Anyone found in possession of
it will be taken into custody.

72
00:05:06,214 --> 00:05:07,953
Isn't that a bit extreme?

73
00:05:08,147 --> 00:05:11,653
The investigation is ongoing,
so I can't tell you everything...

74
00:05:11,842 --> 00:05:14,815
but it does seem that its users suffer some side effects.

75
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:20,514
Anyway, I find the users of
any drug usually turn to crime.

76
00:05:22,515 --> 00:05:24,771
Saten, is there something bothering you?

77
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:25,430
Oh...

78
00:05:26,018 --> 00:05:27,935
no. Not at all.

79
00:05:32,518 --> 00:05:33,933
I'm so sorry!

80
00:05:37,154 --> 00:05:38,582
Please don't worry about it.

81
00:05:38,761 --> 00:05:40,418
It just got on my stockings,

82
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:42,103
so once I take them off...

83
00:05:42,556 --> 00:05:47,000
How many times do we have to tell you not to
take your clothing off while you're in public?!

84
00:05:47,069 --> 00:05:48,569
Look at me for a moment.

85
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:51,408
It's not like I'm anything particularly special...

86
00:05:51,871 --> 00:05:54,704
No man in here is going to care about seeing my body.

87
00:05:54,732 --> 00:05:57,529
Everyone has different tastes, so you can't really know...

88
00:05:57,554 --> 00:06:01,174
Besides which, it's not only men
you should be thinking of, you know?!

89
00:06:04,735 --> 00:06:07,927
I know you're busy, so thank
you for giving us this information.

90
00:06:08,387 --> 00:06:10,157
No... I thank you...

91
00:06:10,351 --> 00:06:12,883
This has reminded me of the time when I was a teacher.

92
00:06:13,296 --> 00:06:14,121
I've enjoyed it.

93
00:06:15,188 --> 00:06:17,592
I didn't realize you'd been a teacher before.

94
00:06:17,617 --> 00:06:18,754
I was once...

95
00:06:19,362 --> 00:06:19,761
Bye.

96
00:06:24,037 --> 00:06:26,753
I don't know what to say. She's a little different, huh?

97
00:06:27,579 --> 00:06:29,637
Aren't you a little different, too?

98
00:06:30,877 --> 00:06:31,900
All right then...

99
00:06:32,076 --> 00:06:34,409
I think it's time we headed back to the office now.

100
00:06:34,468 --> 00:06:35,694
That's a good idea.

101
00:06:35,719 --> 00:06:39,015
and we should put whatever data
we have together for Dr. Kiyama.

102
00:06:39,248 --> 00:06:40,373
Yes, you're right.

103
00:06:44,008 --> 00:06:47,350
Okay guys, so we're all ready to
head back to the branch then, yeah?

104
00:06:48,267 --> 00:06:49,541
Where did Sissy go?

105
00:06:52,296 --> 00:06:53,713
I don't want to give this up.

106
00:06:56,756 --> 00:06:58,541
It's not like I've used it yet.

107
00:06:59,379 --> 00:07:01,133
So I don't have to tell anyone.

108
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:13,773
But I worked so hard to find it.

109
00:07:15,596 --> 00:07:16,644
Are you okay?

110
00:07:17,368 --> 00:07:19,541
Misaka! Why are...

111
00:07:19,566 --> 00:07:21,478
Well, you disappeared so suddenly.

112
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:23,982
I was a little bit worried about you.

113
00:07:24,913 --> 00:07:26,913
Oh... it's nothing, really.

114
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,528
Are you sure?

115
00:07:28,553 --> 00:07:34,052
Oh, well... It's just that you know, it feels
like everybody is involved in this case other than me.

116
00:07:35,825 --> 00:07:37,495
I'm not Judgment or anything.

117
00:07:43,658 --> 00:07:45,243
Thanks you didn't have do that.

118
00:07:45,473 --> 00:07:47,850
You've always got that thing hanging from your bag.

119
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:50,329
Yeah... I guess I do.

120
00:07:51,813 --> 00:07:53,043
I got it from my mom.

121
00:07:56,373 --> 00:07:58,003
It seems silly, huh...?

122
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,844
It's not as if good luck charms are scientific

123
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,900
You're gonna be an Esper, Sis! That's so cool!

124
00:08:12,606 --> 00:08:13,564
Sweetheart...

125
00:08:13,883 --> 00:08:15,217
I need you to know...

126
00:08:15,242 --> 00:08:17,160
I'm not totally on board with this.

127
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:20,985
Mom's a big worrywart, huh?

128
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:24,571
I'm just concerned about her.

129
00:08:24,596 --> 00:08:26,304
I don't want them messing with her head.

130
00:08:26,546 --> 00:08:28,678
It's not like that at all, Mom!

131
00:08:33,129 --> 00:08:34,573
I want you to take this.

132
00:08:34,598 --> 00:08:36,890
A good luck charm? That's not scientific!

133
00:08:36,932 --> 00:08:40,357
No matter what happens, you can
always, always, come back home...

134
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,876
I want you to know,

135
00:08:42,254 --> 00:08:45,182
you're more important to me than anything else.

136
00:08:47,335 --> 00:08:50,145
At the end of the day, my mom is just superstitious.

137
00:08:51,392 --> 00:08:54,370
It's not like something like
this can protect me anyway, right?

138
00:08:55,182 --> 00:08:56,699
It's not as if it's magic.

139
00:08:57,236 --> 00:08:59,643
It sounds like your mom is really nice...

140
00:09:00,461 --> 00:09:04,135
What I mean is, she cares enough about
you to give you a charm like that, right?

141
00:09:05,726 --> 00:09:06,976
Yeah, she's a good mom.

142
00:09:07,619 --> 00:09:11,551
But even still, sometimes I feel like
I'm not living up to expectations...

143
00:09:11,753 --> 00:09:14,820
It's been all this time, and I'm still only a Level Zero.

144
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:16,614
Aw, Saten, really...?

145
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,584
Does your level matter that much?

146
00:09:29,881 --> 00:09:30,849
How is it going?

147
00:09:32,645 --> 00:09:35,904
There's a lot of code and jargon
here, so it's hard to know for sure,

148
00:09:36,229 --> 00:09:40,981
but I think I've managed to uncover some sites
that look like they're Level Upper exchange spots.

149
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,737
Good job, Uiharu!

150
00:09:43,344 --> 00:09:45,344
A list of presumptive places.

151
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:47,955
Wow, there sure are a lot of them, aren't there?

152
00:09:49,866 --> 00:09:51,334
Hey, what are you doing?

153
00:09:51,734 --> 00:09:53,814
It has to be one of these places, right...?

154
00:09:54,198 --> 00:09:57,225
So, if I go through them one...
by... one, I'll find it eventually.

155
00:10:06,163 --> 00:10:07,239
Level Upper, huh?

156
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,560
It's everything I've dreamed of...

157
00:10:10,869 --> 00:10:13,261
Something that will finally make me an esper.

158
00:10:13,853 --> 00:10:15,499
But I don't know anything about it,

159
00:10:15,706 --> 00:10:16,765
and that scares me...

160
00:10:17,376 --> 00:10:18,630
What if it isn't good?

161
00:10:22,259 --> 00:10:23,861
You said you would give it to me!

162
00:10:23,908 --> 00:10:25,202
Where's the Level Upper?

163
00:10:33,637 --> 00:10:34,752
The price has gone up.

164
00:10:37,229 --> 00:10:40,317
If you want this, it's gonna
take another hundred thousand.

165
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:42,909
Could you just give me my money back?

166
00:10:48,411 --> 00:10:49,625
Please, just stop!

167
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:51,333
Quit whining and give us the money!

168
00:10:53,206 --> 00:10:55,999
Is he a test to see how elevated your levels are?

169
00:10:56,769 --> 00:10:58,752
Need to know how far you've come, huh?

170
00:11:05,356 --> 00:11:08,023
I should really call Judgment or Antiskill.

171
00:11:10,857 --> 00:11:13,115
Aw, great! My battery's dead!

172
00:11:17,452 --> 00:11:18,211
Really...

173
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:19,941
what can I do?

174
00:11:20,482 --> 00:11:23,738
There are three of them... and
I'm barely out of grade school...

175
00:11:24,523 --> 00:11:26,709
What can I possibly hope to accomplish?

176
00:11:27,442 --> 00:11:28,677
I'm a level zero...

177
00:11:29,349 --> 00:11:31,581
how can I help in a situation like this?

178
00:11:39,585 --> 00:11:40,790
You leave him alone!

179
00:11:41,873 --> 00:11:43,817
Can't you stop? He's already hurt...

180
00:11:44,053 --> 00:11:46,721
and Antiskill will be arriving at any moment!

181
00:11:51,945 --> 00:11:53,713
'Scuse me... What did you say?

182
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:58,036
You've got a smart mouth on you, don't you, kid?

183
00:11:58,748 --> 00:12:00,842
But you also don't have any power.

184
00:12:01,034 --> 00:12:03,750
so what right do you have to tell me what to do?

185
00:12:05,552 --> 00:12:07,972
You have power, so you think you've earned it.

186
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,139
Well, I've got news for you: you haven't.

187
00:12:10,204 --> 00:12:11,392
So leave her alone...

188
00:12:11,482 --> 00:12:14,729
You're a bunch of pathetic losers with no power at all!

189
00:12:15,361 --> 00:12:17,462
And I am an officer of Judgment!

190
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:18,789
Shirai's here?

191
00:12:18,814 --> 00:12:21,838
I'm placing you under arrest for aggravated assault.

192
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:23,183
Now cooperate.

193
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,260
Ha...! You've got to be kidding me, here!

194
00:12:31,813 --> 00:12:34,725
One more little kid to deal with isn't gonna a problem.

195
00:12:34,896 --> 00:12:36,744
You should really be more careful...

196
00:12:37,143 --> 00:12:39,850
I've been running around the city for hours already...

197
00:12:40,103 --> 00:12:44,497
and then I finally find what I'm looking for
and it's a bunch of thugs assaulting my friend.

198
00:12:45,795 --> 00:12:47,467
What are you talking about?

199
00:12:52,308 --> 00:12:55,043
It looks like I'm going to be
hazardous to your health today.

200
00:13:07,599 --> 00:13:09,735
Interesting! Quite a skill.

201
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:12,029
Teleportation, huh...?

202
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,690
I never seen that before.

203
00:13:14,297 --> 00:13:16,583
It almost seems like you're disinterested...

204
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:19,488
but you're very much involved right now.

205
00:13:20,588 --> 00:13:24,284
Before the Level Upper, we used
to be scared of you Judgment types.

206
00:13:25,313 --> 00:13:28,497
But there have been some pretty
big changes lately, you see...

207
00:13:28,674 --> 00:13:29,743
We're stronger.

208
00:13:31,754 --> 00:13:33,487
And now that we've gotten stronger...

209
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:37,379
we'd like nothing more than to pound
you and people like you into the ground!

210
00:13:40,756 --> 00:13:42,401
Too bad you're going to lose to...

211
00:13:43,901 --> 00:13:44,901
He vanished!

212
00:13:48,019 --> 00:13:49,287
He came from behind me.

213
00:13:49,312 --> 00:13:50,875
He must've sneaked up somehow.

214
00:13:51,754 --> 00:13:53,353
I don't think I have much choice!

215
00:13:53,385 --> 00:13:55,283
I'm going to have to use these on him.

216
00:13:56,408 --> 00:13:57,708
I... missed him!

217
00:14:02,348 --> 00:14:05,501
First I have to figure out why
I can't anticipate his movements.

218
00:14:25,915 --> 00:14:28,832
Yep, that was a different direction than I expected.

219
00:14:32,177 --> 00:14:34,320
That was pretty cool, I have to say...

220
00:14:34,827 --> 00:14:36,799
You cracked, what, one, two ribs?

221
00:14:44,512 --> 00:14:46,263
What do you think you're doing now...?

222
00:14:46,734 --> 00:14:49,481
Aw, don't tell me you can't teleport anymore.

223
00:14:50,171 --> 00:14:52,171
I'm not through playin' just yet.

224
00:14:57,108 --> 00:14:58,983
What, are we playing tag, now?

225
00:14:59,129 --> 00:15:00,842
It's fine if you wanna run away,

226
00:15:01,072 --> 00:15:04,694
but that just means the other two
are forfeit... the girl and the fatty...

227
00:15:04,823 --> 00:15:06,071
I'll just kill them.

228
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,125
This building is scheduled for demolition...

229
00:15:12,796 --> 00:15:15,802
I probably won't be able to
find anywhere safe to hide in here.

230
00:15:22,309 --> 00:15:23,566
I don't hear anything...

231
00:15:24,107 --> 00:15:25,185
no footsteps.

232
00:15:34,803 --> 00:15:38,704
Okay... at this point, he should
still think I'm on the first floor.

233
00:15:41,594 --> 00:15:43,054
Ah! Found ya!

234
00:15:46,662 --> 00:15:50,201
Funny story: one of our hangouts
happens to be in this building...

235
00:15:50,551 --> 00:15:53,106
so I know every last little nook and cranny.

236
00:15:55,904 --> 00:15:58,231
And in here... sound resonates.

237
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:04,438
Hey, kid.

238
00:16:04,752 --> 00:16:07,224
you heard what I said about sound, didn't you?

239
00:16:07,948 --> 00:16:11,383
You can spend all your time
tiring yourself out and runnin' away.

240
00:16:12,007 --> 00:16:13,716
I don't think it'll take very long.

241
00:16:14,141 --> 00:16:15,935
I'll get you soon enough.

242
00:16:20,465 --> 00:16:23,296
Seems like you're finally tired of playing tag.

243
00:16:24,966 --> 00:16:26,109
All right, girl.

244
00:16:26,433 --> 00:16:27,902
let's take care of this.

245
00:16:30,903 --> 00:16:32,364
I kinda pity you.

246
00:16:32,823 --> 00:16:37,671
Your life is going to end before you
even know what ability ultimately did you in.

247
00:16:38,322 --> 00:16:39,925
I know more than you think...

248
00:16:40,657 --> 00:16:43,735
You have the power to mislead
peoples' visual perception...

249
00:16:44,133 --> 00:16:47,825
You distort the light around you to
make it show what you want it to show.

250
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:49,964
You figured it out.

251
00:16:50,555 --> 00:16:53,400
Your legs swing around at an impossible angle.

252
00:16:53,825 --> 00:16:56,282
Things I throw trace an impossible trajectory.

253
00:16:57,708 --> 00:17:01,617
Basically, you project the image
of yourself to a different location.

254
00:17:03,067 --> 00:17:05,567
So my focus is diverted to a different area...

255
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,411
and my attacks end up missing your actual body.

256
00:17:09,213 --> 00:17:10,326
That explains it.

257
00:17:10,464 --> 00:17:12,112
The pins I threw curved...

258
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:13,932
Because of you!

259
00:17:16,537 --> 00:17:18,240
Heh... Enjoy.

260
00:17:18,265 --> 00:17:19,629
I call it Trick Art...

261
00:17:20,111 --> 00:17:21,053
So what now?

262
00:17:21,138 --> 00:17:23,720
How do you plan on fighting against my power?

263
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:27,417
You have nothing to rely on but your own eyes.

264
00:17:28,825 --> 00:17:29,705
Perhaps...

265
00:17:30,363 --> 00:17:33,470
Maybe what you say is true, and I can't hit you directly.

266
00:17:39,118 --> 00:17:42,055
Huh? What are you trying now, girl?

267
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:44,192
Here's the thing about teleportation...

268
00:17:44,418 --> 00:17:48,171
It means I have the power to displace
matter from one place to another.

269
00:17:49,851 --> 00:17:55,278
One example of this is my ability to cut through
these steel... reinforced columns with window glass.

270
00:17:55,879 --> 00:17:57,921
Look, this is your final warning.

271
00:17:59,619 --> 00:18:01,410
Drop your weapon and surrender...

272
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:04,705
If you refuse, I can't guarantee your safety.

273
00:18:05,563 --> 00:18:08,272
Give up? Are you kidding me?

274
00:18:08,415 --> 00:18:10,912
I'm not the one who should be surrendering here.

275
00:18:12,742 --> 00:18:13,967
It's sad really...

276
00:18:14,133 --> 00:18:16,761
I wish our situation didn't have to be this way.

277
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:20,883
But unfortunately you're leaving me with no other option.

278
00:18:21,473 --> 00:18:22,965
You should say your prayers.

279
00:18:23,134 --> 00:18:24,285
'Cause at this point,

280
00:18:24,402 --> 00:18:26,860
I'm afraid I have no choice but to crush you.

281
00:18:27,132 --> 00:18:29,640
your little light trick isn't going to save you this time.

282
00:18:41,511 --> 00:18:43,529
What the hell d'ya think you're doing?

283
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:53,257
Do you know what will happen after I destroy
all the columns that are supporting the building?

284
00:19:01,147 --> 00:19:03,003
You can make a guess, can't you?

285
00:19:03,493 --> 00:19:05,659
You wouldn't! No way!

286
00:19:08,318 --> 00:19:09,762
You can't do this!!!

287
00:19:33,971 --> 00:19:36,463
I was a little worried I may have overdone it a bit,

288
00:19:36,488 --> 00:19:37,661
but... hah...

289
00:19:37,775 --> 00:19:41,156
it was scheduled for demolition
anyway, so I guess it's no big deal.

290
00:19:42,095 --> 00:19:44,982
Now... I'll be taking that Level Upper from you. 'Kay?

291
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:48,489
Aw, do you wanna cry?

292
00:19:48,514 --> 00:19:51,346
We can go demolish some more buildings if you would like.

293
00:19:53,304 --> 00:19:54,400
Are you kidding me?

294
00:19:54,425 --> 00:19:56,853
The best you can do is hand me a music player...?

295
00:19:57,228 --> 00:19:59,196
Please, don't be ridiculous.

296
00:19:59,914 --> 00:20:01,581
But the Level Upper, it,

297
00:20:01,715 --> 00:20:03,020
it's a song!

298
00:20:03,482 --> 00:20:05,575
Wha-what did you say?

299
00:20:07,361 --> 00:20:09,858
That's some good work... We'll take over from here.

300
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:31,690
Gosh... I'm so glad Shirai is safe.

301
00:20:34,011 --> 00:20:35,251
I feel this way...

302
00:20:35,504 --> 00:20:36,546
but I'm not proud.

303
00:20:37,719 --> 00:20:38,779
She's a friend...

304
00:20:39,422 --> 00:20:40,575
She's my age...

305
00:20:41,338 --> 00:20:45,890
We are so similar in so many ways, but
she happens to be Levels up from me...

306
00:20:46,636 --> 00:20:48,400
and it hurts a lot of the time.

307
00:20:50,414 --> 00:20:52,907
How can a Level Zero relate to an Esper?

308
00:20:54,058 --> 00:20:54,998
I wish I knew.

309
00:21:03,557 --> 00:21:04,410
Ruiko!

310
00:21:05,206 --> 00:21:05,918
Hey!

311
00:21:06,507 --> 00:21:07,582
How's it goin'?

312
00:21:08,337 --> 00:21:10,225
Akemi? And Mu,

313
00:21:10,262 --> 00:21:11,455
and Mako, too!

314
00:21:12,248 --> 00:21:14,273
What are you doing here alone, studying?

315
00:21:15,301 --> 00:21:16,801
Yeah, I guess you could say that...

316
00:21:16,972 --> 00:21:18,079
What about you guys?

317
00:21:18,483 --> 00:21:20,293
Just studying at the library.

318
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:24,184
We can't change our ability levels,
but we still have to keep our grades up.

319
00:21:24,899 --> 00:21:25,963
Yeah, I know.

320
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:30,513
Oh, hey guys, have you heard about this Level Upper thing?

321
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,785
Hold on what are you talking about?

322
00:21:33,853 --> 00:21:34,824
Oh I know,

323
00:21:34,892 --> 00:21:37,393
It's the thing that's supposed to increase your ability.

324
00:21:37,575 --> 00:21:38,541
Yeah, yeah...

325
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:42,314
and I heard someone say that it goes
for a lot of money on the black market.

326
00:21:42,339 --> 00:21:43,889
Well, I don't have any money!

327
00:21:45,523 --> 00:21:47,122
Um... hey, you guys...

328
00:21:51,008 --> 00:21:51,951
I have one...

329
00:21:52,539 --> 00:21:53,216
you know...

330
00:21:54,609 --> 00:21:56,020
I've got one of them.

331
00:23:30,878 --> 00:23:34,397
Maybe I was trying to pretend I
was okay with not having an ability.

332
00:23:35,911 --> 00:23:37,196
And maybe I was wrong...

333
00:23:37,464 --> 00:23:39,261
Saten! Please, no!
