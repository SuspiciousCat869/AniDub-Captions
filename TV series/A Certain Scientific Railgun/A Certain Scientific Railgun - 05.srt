1
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:16,470
Give me a break!

2
00:00:16,884 --> 00:00:20,763
I can't believe they still have me training
with the green recruits after all this time.

3
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:25,009
I didn't join Judgment to spend time
doing pushups with a bunch of newbies.

4
00:00:30,926 --> 00:00:31,911
Come on, Uiharu!

5
00:00:32,347 --> 00:00:33,426
Can't you even do one?

6
00:00:41,311 --> 00:00:42,895
Here, would you like a sip of this?

7
00:00:49,357 --> 00:00:53,622
Wow. An entire year, really? You've
already been in Judgment that long, Shirai?

8
00:00:54,318 --> 00:00:57,632
So, I guess they must be letting
you go out in the field by now, huh?

9
00:00:58,616 --> 00:01:00,759
Yeah of course they are.

10
00:01:00,843 --> 00:01:01,997
How exciting.

11
00:01:02,077 --> 00:01:04,457
That's kind of out of the question for someone like me.

12
00:01:04,482 --> 00:01:05,894
I'm not very athletic.

13
00:01:06,509 --> 00:01:08,204
I've always been a straggler.

14
00:01:08,325 --> 00:01:12,101
And I was hoping that if they accepted me
into Judgment, it might help me to change that.

15
00:01:12,741 --> 00:01:15,442
But what use is it if I can't
even keep up with the training?

16
00:01:17,345 --> 00:01:21,569
You must always follow your convictions and
act in the way you feel is right at all times.

17
00:01:22,112 --> 00:01:24,847
That's one of Judgment's primary philosophies, you know.

18
00:01:25,862 --> 00:01:28,833
If you can just nurture the
strength to stick to your convictions,

19
00:01:28,921 --> 00:01:31,075
the results you seek are sure to follow in time.

20
00:03:05,093 --> 00:03:06,295
Let's see here.

21
00:03:06,563 --> 00:03:08,896
Where else do we need to get these cameras installed?

22
00:03:09,218 --> 00:03:10,124
Right over there.

23
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:11,274
And there, too, I think.

24
00:03:12,343 --> 00:03:13,640
It's almost shameful.

25
00:03:13,724 --> 00:03:18,325
I really can't believe they've put off the
installation of additional surveillance cameras until now.

26
00:03:18,718 --> 00:03:22,321
The Judgment officers at this school
must be pretty lax to have let this happen.

27
00:03:22,843 --> 00:03:26,009
Well, at least they're taking care
of it now before any real harm is done.

28
00:03:26,093 --> 00:03:28,259
That's not the point. It's the principle of the...

29
00:03:29,343 --> 00:03:30,426
Come on. Let's go!

30
00:03:30,509 --> 00:03:31,062
Right!

31
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:40,444
Seriously?

32
00:03:40,648 --> 00:03:42,457
Right out in broad daylight.

33
00:03:42,801 --> 00:03:46,115
At school and in front of Judgment officers, too.

34
00:03:46,926 --> 00:03:50,301
You can't go out there alone. You
have wait a minute for backup to arrive.

35
00:03:50,384 --> 00:03:51,968
Don't worry, I can handle this.

36
00:03:52,051 --> 00:03:53,301
You stay here. I'll be fine.

37
00:03:56,404 --> 00:03:58,386
All right, that's as far as you're getting.

38
00:03:58,968 --> 00:03:59,480
Huh?

39
00:04:00,134 --> 00:04:01,760
Judgment knows your crimes now.

40
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:03,186
I am arresting you.

41
00:04:03,211 --> 00:04:05,678
The charges are destruction of property and burglary.

42
00:04:06,259 --> 00:04:08,676
Please be careful. There may be more than one burglar.

43
00:04:08,701 --> 00:04:11,650
Please, that doesn't really matter.
Car thieves are small potatoes.

44
00:04:11,786 --> 00:04:13,011
They're easy to deal with.

45
00:04:14,894 --> 00:04:17,227
Now, if you would please come along quietly.

46
00:04:17,501 --> 00:04:18,860
Cooperate and no harm will...

47
00:04:20,945 --> 00:04:21,730
Shirai!

48
00:04:21,926 --> 00:04:23,262
Hey! Let's get going!

49
00:04:23,551 --> 00:04:23,927
Right.

50
00:04:25,034 --> 00:04:26,600
Wait! Please, stop running!

51
00:04:26,634 --> 00:04:27,301
Move it!

52
00:04:35,386 --> 00:04:36,261
Uiharu?

53
00:04:39,634 --> 00:04:40,673
Uiharu!

54
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:42,709
Uiharu! Shake it off! Get up!

55
00:04:43,997 --> 00:04:44,941
Oh, good!

56
00:04:47,963 --> 00:04:49,864
I... I think I'm all right.

57
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:51,864
My goodness.

58
00:04:52,171 --> 00:04:54,587
I think that took a year or two off of my life.

59
00:04:56,551 --> 00:04:58,009
What about the burglars?

60
00:04:58,093 --> 00:04:59,327
They'll be long gone by now.

61
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:01,433
My word.

62
00:05:01,829 --> 00:05:06,614
You know, Uiharu, today's further proof
you're not ready to be a full-fledged officer.

63
00:05:06,926 --> 00:05:07,861
You should stay back.

64
00:05:08,043 --> 00:05:10,926
Just sit at the branch office
backing me up like you always have.

65
00:05:11,207 --> 00:05:12,968
But that's not fair.

66
00:05:13,051 --> 00:05:14,463
I did try to help you.

67
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:18,893
I told you that you should be careful because
there might be more than one of them in there,

68
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,647
but you totally ignored me and now they've gotten away!

69
00:05:21,672 --> 00:05:24,432
You're always doing this, again and again.

70
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:28,901
You're reckless, and you try to do too much on your
own, even though it keeps getting you into trouble.

71
00:05:28,948 --> 00:05:31,864
You... You're exaggerating things a little, aren't you?

72
00:05:31,988 --> 00:05:34,217
When have I ever rushed into a situation on my ow...

73
00:05:34,242 --> 00:05:36,280
The better question would be, when have you not?

74
00:05:36,305 --> 00:05:37,468
You're always doing it!

75
00:05:37,493 --> 00:05:38,960
Just like now. You could've waited for...

76
00:05:38,985 --> 00:05:42,176
I suppose you think it would've been better
to stand there and let the criminals get away?

77
00:05:42,201 --> 00:05:44,107
Would you stop and think about what you've done?

78
00:05:44,172 --> 00:05:48,051
If you keep this kind of behavior up,
what will become of the promise we made?

79
00:05:52,468 --> 00:05:53,403
The promise?

80
00:05:55,012 --> 00:05:57,262
You mean you don't remember?

81
00:05:57,551 --> 00:05:58,509
Well, uh...

82
00:06:00,718 --> 00:06:01,848
Oh, never mind!

83
00:06:01,929 --> 00:06:04,865
If you don't even care, I
won't bother helping you anymore!

84
00:06:05,304 --> 00:06:07,017
Just do whatever you want!

85
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:20,445
How're you doing?

86
00:06:20,593 --> 00:06:22,260
Is Uiharu around today?

87
00:06:22,722 --> 00:06:24,055
Oh, you're here again?

88
00:06:24,082 --> 00:06:26,432
You can't just stop by to hang out whenever you want.

89
00:06:26,509 --> 00:06:28,379
Yeah, yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

90
00:06:28,711 --> 00:06:30,807
But I have a legitimate reason this time.

91
00:06:31,009 --> 00:06:31,664
See?

92
00:06:32,044 --> 00:06:33,885
A bona fide school assignment.

93
00:06:33,986 --> 00:06:36,273
I was going to see if Uiharu would help me.

94
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:38,003
Ah, geez.

95
00:06:38,217 --> 00:06:39,695
Fine, she's right over there.

96
00:06:39,843 --> 00:06:40,448
See?

97
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:44,381
So, you know, it might not be the best time.

98
00:06:44,877 --> 00:06:46,707
She's in a pretty foul mood right now.

99
00:06:46,732 --> 00:06:49,371
U... i... ha... ru!

100
00:06:49,968 --> 00:06:51,633
We've got clovers today, huh?

101
00:06:51,864 --> 00:06:54,634
Where's the lucky four-leaf
clover? There must be one here.

102
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:59,335
Hey! I'm lifting it up even higher!

103
00:06:59,551 --> 00:07:01,218
My, what a nice view!

104
00:07:03,404 --> 00:07:04,332
Something's wrong.

105
00:07:04,364 --> 00:07:05,746
What is the matter with her?

106
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,134
She got into it with Shirai a bit,

107
00:07:08,159 --> 00:07:10,200
so she's a little off.

108
00:07:14,502 --> 00:07:16,597
Wow, that sounds like quite an argument.

109
00:07:16,843 --> 00:07:17,991
It was pretty ugly.

110
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,643
We should probably just leave
her alone for a little while.

111
00:07:23,195 --> 00:07:26,703
I can see how that might make her think
about leaving her post at Judgment altogether.

112
00:07:27,472 --> 00:07:28,862
Whoa, hold on there.

113
00:07:29,154 --> 00:07:31,214
Let's not give her any crazy ideas.

114
00:07:31,781 --> 00:07:36,575
Together with Antiskill, Judgment is in charge of
maintaining peace and safety within Academy City.

115
00:07:36,991 --> 00:07:39,170
It's not the kind of job you can just toss aside.

116
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,490
Oh. I see.

117
00:07:41,585 --> 00:07:44,147
But is giving her time alone really all we can do?

118
00:07:44,341 --> 00:07:46,486
There's more between those two than meets the eye.

119
00:07:46,634 --> 00:07:49,051
So, I think they'll work it out somehow.

120
00:07:49,134 --> 00:07:49,616
Huh?

121
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:51,996
What do you mean there's more between them?

122
00:07:54,277 --> 00:07:55,319
Well, you see...

123
00:08:11,856 --> 00:08:13,410
I can't take it anymore!

124
00:08:13,435 --> 00:08:17,390
If this fight is really bothering you so much,
why don't you go ahead and make up with her already?

125
00:08:19,783 --> 00:08:21,071
Don't want to.

126
00:08:21,404 --> 00:08:22,487
You need to do something.

127
00:08:22,576 --> 00:08:23,270
Talk to her.

128
00:08:23,672 --> 00:08:27,247
Otherwise, she's going to stay angry with
you, and your partnership will fall apart.

129
00:08:28,972 --> 00:08:30,854
Maybe that's just how it has to be.

130
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:34,533
If it ends over something like this, it
wasn't much of a partnership to begin with.

131
00:08:34,843 --> 00:08:36,391
There's that bravado she mentioned.

132
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:38,018
It isn't just bravado!

133
00:08:39,856 --> 00:08:42,522
You and Uiharu have such different personalities.

134
00:08:42,718 --> 00:08:44,720
How did you become partners in the first place?

135
00:08:46,509 --> 00:08:48,426
Well, it's a long story.

136
00:08:50,484 --> 00:08:52,783
It wasn't something I had planned on happening.

137
00:08:53,843 --> 00:08:56,556
She was so slow she could barely keep up in training.

138
00:08:57,134 --> 00:08:58,468
But then one day...

139
00:09:04,518 --> 00:09:06,978
Okay. That concludes our patrol for the day.

140
00:09:07,182 --> 00:09:09,676
If you have any questions, now's the time to ask.

141
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:13,481
Actually, there is something I'd like to ask.

142
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:14,974
What is it?

143
00:09:15,302 --> 00:09:18,252
I've been a member of Judgment
for an entire year at this point.

144
00:09:18,311 --> 00:09:20,479
I'm always stuck doing research and odd jobs,

145
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:24,368
or I accompany you when you go on
patrol. It's not what I expected.

146
00:09:25,051 --> 00:09:29,326
You're upset because you're an honor student, but
you're not being treated as a full-fledged officer, right?

147
00:09:30,646 --> 00:09:33,104
I don't know if that's how I would put it, exactly.

148
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:36,131
I thought that maybe it was because
I'm still in elementary school.

149
00:09:38,221 --> 00:09:40,555
Your age isn't the only cause for concern.

150
00:09:40,926 --> 00:09:42,010
There's another issue.

151
00:09:42,343 --> 00:09:44,315
You've shown a lot of potential so far,

152
00:09:44,363 --> 00:09:46,782
but you have a habit of trying
to solve things by yourself,

153
00:09:46,843 --> 00:09:47,899
and that's dangerous.

154
00:09:47,924 --> 00:09:52,029
You have to learn to rely more on other people
around you, or you could get yourself into trouble.

155
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,166
Come on, don't make that face.

156
00:09:55,488 --> 00:09:59,126
Tell you what, why don't I buy you something
sweet as a reward for all your hard work?

157
00:09:59,285 --> 00:10:01,523
Just hang on one sec while I withdraw some cash.

158
00:10:02,442 --> 00:10:05,173
I knew it. She does still think of me as a child.

159
00:10:17,676 --> 00:10:18,793
Hello, Shirai!

160
00:10:19,444 --> 00:10:21,047
What a coincidence!

161
00:10:21,249 --> 00:10:23,749
Uiharu? What are you doing in the Seventh District?

162
00:10:24,468 --> 00:10:28,666
Middle school is almost here, so I came to
look at the different schools and dormitories.

163
00:10:28,963 --> 00:10:30,151
Middle school, huh?

164
00:10:30,223 --> 00:10:31,455
You have an older friend?

165
00:10:32,775 --> 00:10:35,069
Why would you say that? I'm looking for my own sake.

166
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:36,759
It's such a big decision.

167
00:10:36,843 --> 00:10:38,026
Oh, uh... huh.

168
00:10:38,051 --> 00:10:39,621
She's the same age as I am?

169
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:42,009
I always thought she was two or three years younger.

170
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:45,468
So, Shirai, have you decided which
school you're going to go to yet?

171
00:10:45,618 --> 00:10:47,078
Oh. Yeah, I have.

172
00:10:47,119 --> 00:10:49,192
It's this place called Tokiwadai Middle School.

173
00:10:54,142 --> 00:10:55,753
What a great opportunity!

174
00:10:55,896 --> 00:10:59,962
Tokiwadai is one of the five most
prestigious schools in Academy City!

175
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:03,132
I bet life at a place like that is so refined and elegant!

176
00:11:04,156 --> 00:11:07,190
It may not actually be as glamorous
as you're making it out to be.

177
00:11:08,259 --> 00:11:10,178
I bet everybody is pretentious.

178
00:11:10,263 --> 00:11:13,844
All the students who are enrolled at
the school are at least a Level 3 Esper.

179
00:11:14,239 --> 00:11:14,775
Basically,

180
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:19,279
it's going to be full of a whole bunch of girls, all
of whom are convinced that they are somebody special.

181
00:11:20,028 --> 00:11:24,307
From what I hear, there's a Level 5 there
who they've given the absurd nickname "Railgun".

182
00:11:24,668 --> 00:11:28,762
I can only imagine how arrogant and
condescending a girl like that is going to be.

183
00:11:30,043 --> 00:11:33,325
That's a pretty severe assessment
of someone you've never met before.

184
00:11:33,531 --> 00:11:36,114
So, if you came to look at
schools, what are you doing in here?

185
00:11:36,676 --> 00:11:37,909
Is something the matter?

186
00:11:38,093 --> 00:11:39,038
Excuse me.

187
00:11:41,051 --> 00:11:42,397
Is something going on?

188
00:11:45,309 --> 00:11:46,435
That man over there.

189
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:50,248
He's focusing on where the
workers are and what they're doing.

190
00:11:52,134 --> 00:11:54,468
I don't like looking at people's
things without their permission,

191
00:11:54,551 --> 00:11:55,976
but I'll have to make an exception.

192
00:11:59,487 --> 00:12:01,471
I don't see anything too out of place.

193
00:12:04,301 --> 00:12:05,876
He has a gun in his right pocket.

194
00:12:06,593 --> 00:12:07,744
He's robbing the place?

195
00:12:07,884 --> 00:12:09,395
I'll go inform the employees.

196
00:12:09,556 --> 00:12:13,059
I want you ready to lead the customers out
if it looks like something bad is happening.

197
00:12:13,361 --> 00:12:14,884
You're not going to arrest him?

198
00:12:15,176 --> 00:12:16,911
Of course not. That would be out of bounds.

199
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:18,384
That's a job for Antiskill.

200
00:12:18,409 --> 00:12:19,784
They're the ones who catch criminals.

201
00:12:23,277 --> 00:12:25,492
How can she be so complacent about it?

202
00:12:26,055 --> 00:12:26,968
That's correct.

203
00:12:27,051 --> 00:12:28,436
Contact the Antiskill...

204
00:12:35,593 --> 00:12:37,202
No one try anything funny.

205
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:39,484
Everybody keep quiet.

206
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:41,078
There's no need to make a big scene.

207
00:12:41,371 --> 00:12:43,064
Damn, he's already making a move.

208
00:12:44,761 --> 00:12:46,469
This is what I've been training for.

209
00:13:02,884 --> 00:13:03,923
What do you know?

210
00:13:04,018 --> 00:13:05,661
That wasn't so difficult after all.

211
00:13:07,884 --> 00:13:08,864
Pathetic.

212
00:13:09,126 --> 00:13:11,709
Letting a little girl like that get the best of you.

213
00:13:12,097 --> 00:13:13,232
You're useless.

214
00:13:14,468 --> 00:13:15,426
Uiharu!

215
00:13:15,826 --> 00:13:18,718
What's that? So this other girl is a friend of yours, huh?

216
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:22,806
That's very convenient.

217
00:13:24,551 --> 00:13:26,365
Easy, now. Stay right where you are.

218
00:13:26,551 --> 00:13:28,154
You're with Judgment, aren't you?

219
00:13:28,387 --> 00:13:31,179
A Judgment officer could never abandon a hostage, right?

220
00:13:31,247 --> 00:13:33,621
Especially if she happened to be a friend as well.

221
00:13:35,715 --> 00:13:37,145
Could this get any worse?

222
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:39,640
If so, they should come out now.

223
00:13:46,981 --> 00:13:47,981
What are they thinking?

224
00:13:48,099 --> 00:13:50,436
Sounding the alarm is going to spook them.

225
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:52,814
Do they care more about the money than people's lives?

226
00:13:54,239 --> 00:13:55,596
Security signal received.

227
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:57,254
Security signal received.

228
00:13:57,575 --> 00:13:59,249
Proceeding to eliminate intruder.

229
00:13:59,634 --> 00:14:00,538
Please drop your weapon and lie down on the floor.

230
00:14:00,563 --> 00:14:01,467
Gimme a break.

231
00:14:01,522 --> 00:14:03,260
There's something in his right pocket.

232
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:05,292
Warning issued.

233
00:14:05,317 --> 00:14:06,467
Initiating action.

234
00:14:16,489 --> 00:14:17,180
Close one!

235
00:14:29,384 --> 00:14:30,510
Konori, no!

236
00:14:31,093 --> 00:14:32,415
Don't charge someone.

237
00:14:32,822 --> 00:14:34,513
Not unless you can be certain

238
00:14:35,227 --> 00:14:36,898
of what they have up their sleeve.

239
00:14:38,634 --> 00:14:39,917
Remember that, okay?

240
00:14:40,489 --> 00:14:41,229
Konori!

241
00:14:41,254 --> 00:14:41,574
Hey!

242
00:14:44,468 --> 00:14:46,200
So, there were more of you hiding here.

243
00:14:46,225 --> 00:14:47,201
Are you okay?

244
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:50,501
He was an idiot.

245
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:53,160
Did you think you could take me so easily?

246
00:14:57,935 --> 00:14:59,038
Please, stop it!

247
00:15:01,523 --> 00:15:02,082
Shirai!

248
00:15:02,106 --> 00:15:02,634
I'll show you.

249
00:15:02,659 --> 00:15:05,014
Are you all right? Please don't hurt her anymore!

250
00:15:05,168 --> 00:15:06,053
Shirai!

251
00:15:06,632 --> 00:15:08,517
There's no one to blame but myself.

252
00:15:08,632 --> 00:15:11,441
I made a reckless decision
without thinking things through.

253
00:15:12,051 --> 00:15:13,238
It's my fault.

254
00:15:13,867 --> 00:15:15,470
I put them both in danger.

255
00:15:16,218 --> 00:15:17,474
What a mess I've made.

256
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,188
Konori was right about me.

257
00:15:21,994 --> 00:15:23,953
This is more trouble than I'd bargained for.

258
00:15:25,745 --> 00:15:26,856
Please!

259
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:27,993
But still.

260
00:15:31,843 --> 00:15:33,036
Just give up already.

261
00:15:33,242 --> 00:15:33,623
No.

262
00:15:34,093 --> 00:15:35,551
You don't have to do this!

263
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:36,555
Please!

264
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,899
If nothing else, I can get you out safely.

265
00:15:41,226 --> 00:15:43,133
What now? What are you up to, kid?

266
00:15:49,131 --> 00:15:49,888
I'm free?

267
00:15:50,551 --> 00:15:51,951
You're a teleporter?

268
00:15:52,724 --> 00:15:54,375
Are you still in there, Shirai?

269
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:55,926
Why didn't you come?

270
00:15:56,009 --> 00:15:57,570
Why did you just send me?

271
00:15:58,468 --> 00:16:00,176
I'll teach you to mess with me.

272
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:01,468
Shirai, get out of there!

273
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:02,637
Come on, hurry!

274
00:16:02,662 --> 00:16:04,445
Unfortunately, that's not an option.

275
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:06,040
My power is not yet at the point

276
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:07,660
where I can transport myself.

277
00:16:08,285 --> 00:16:09,271
And besides,

278
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:12,116
I intend to see this case through to its conclusion.

279
00:16:14,445 --> 00:16:15,349
Say something!

280
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,822
Somebody! Help!

281
00:16:18,868 --> 00:16:20,116
This is an emergency!

282
00:16:20,141 --> 00:16:23,250
There's a burglar inside, and
he's attacking a Judgment officer!

283
00:16:23,426 --> 00:16:24,590
He's got her trapped!

284
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:28,007
Is anybody listening? I need help!

285
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:32,162
I bet I can guess what's going
through your head right now.

286
00:16:33,505 --> 00:16:35,704
You're thinking the alarm sounded a while ago.

287
00:16:36,009 --> 00:16:38,492
So, surely Antiskill will be here any minute now.

288
00:16:38,821 --> 00:16:43,029
And, if you can just stall me and prevent me
from taking hostages, everything will be okay.

289
00:16:44,047 --> 00:16:45,254
I'm right, aren't I?

290
00:16:46,218 --> 00:16:47,426
You're wrong, though.

291
00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:50,576
Because I don't plan to wait
around to be taken into custody.

292
00:17:00,884 --> 00:17:02,361
The power of "Equal Speed."

293
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:07,062
Anything I throw will keep moving
forward until I release my power.

294
00:17:07,087 --> 00:17:08,811
It doesn't matter what's in the way.

295
00:17:09,024 --> 00:17:10,925
All obstacles will be destroyed.

296
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:13,800
Too bad for you.

297
00:17:14,225 --> 00:17:15,684
Didn't see that one coming, huh?

298
00:17:18,426 --> 00:17:19,600
Time's running out.

299
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:20,436
Hey!

300
00:17:21,576 --> 00:17:23,668
Use your power to get the money out of there.

301
00:17:24,372 --> 00:17:26,742
If you cooperate with me, I'll let everyone else go.

302
00:17:28,764 --> 00:17:30,160
Yeah. I know.

303
00:17:30,398 --> 00:17:32,017
You and I should become partners.

304
00:17:32,239 --> 00:17:34,273
Working together we'd be unstoppable.

305
00:17:34,658 --> 00:17:36,127
So, what do you say?

306
00:17:37,436 --> 00:17:39,730
This situation just keeps getting worse.

307
00:17:40,384 --> 00:17:42,055
I acted impulsively.

308
00:17:42,534 --> 00:17:44,806
And I've dragged everyone down with me.

309
00:17:46,093 --> 00:17:49,487
But... It's not over yet.

310
00:17:50,176 --> 00:17:51,528
My answer is...

311
00:17:52,631 --> 00:17:53,459
No!

312
00:17:53,628 --> 00:17:55,617
I'll never work with someone like you!

313
00:17:56,426 --> 00:17:58,105
Be your partner? Please!

314
00:17:58,232 --> 00:18:01,750
You're a petty thief who couldn't even
manage to rob a small place like this

315
00:18:01,775 --> 00:18:03,577
without making a mess of the whole thing.

316
00:18:04,176 --> 00:18:05,657
So, I think I'll pass.

317
00:18:05,779 --> 00:18:07,387
Anybody! Please! Help me!

318
00:18:07,412 --> 00:18:08,807
I've already made my decision.

319
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:11,752
I believe in the power of justice.

320
00:18:12,426 --> 00:18:14,112
And I'll never stray from that!

321
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:15,846
Well, then.

322
00:18:16,926 --> 00:18:18,211
That's too bad.

323
00:18:18,236 --> 00:18:21,121
His ability may be strong, but it isn't especially fast.

324
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,592
As long as my legs cooperate.

325
00:18:24,513 --> 00:18:27,016
That means I'll have to kill you.

326
00:18:28,426 --> 00:18:29,291
Aw, sorry.

327
00:18:29,324 --> 00:18:31,307
Did you think I could only throw one at a time?

328
00:18:43,426 --> 00:18:43,884
Hey!

329
00:18:51,092 --> 00:18:52,634
Your power versus my power.

330
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:54,975
A steel ball versus teleportation.

331
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,750
Shall we see which is the quicker one?

332
00:19:00,968 --> 00:19:01,561
Damn it.

333
00:19:26,186 --> 00:19:28,470
You know, that was pretty amazing!

334
00:19:29,068 --> 00:19:31,940
It takes real skill to handle
something like that by yourself.

335
00:19:32,136 --> 00:19:32,856
Yeah.

336
00:19:34,578 --> 00:19:36,234
What exactly happened there?

337
00:19:38,066 --> 00:19:40,405
If it's okay, I'd like to make you a promise.

338
00:19:41,301 --> 00:19:46,159
I will always follow my convictions and act in
the way I feel is right, just like you told me.

339
00:19:47,232 --> 00:19:50,849
And, like you, I believe in the power
of justice, and I won't stray from it.

340
00:19:51,098 --> 00:19:53,305
No matter what happens I'll never lose heart.

341
00:19:53,512 --> 00:19:54,185
Someday,

342
00:19:54,266 --> 00:19:56,908
I know I'll be as good a Judgment officer as you are.

343
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,321
Thanks, Uiharu.

344
00:20:00,988 --> 00:20:03,003
I'd like to make a promise to you, too.

345
00:20:04,144 --> 00:20:07,533
Until today, I thought I could take
care of everything without anybody's help,

346
00:20:07,697 --> 00:20:08,955
but I was wrong about that.

347
00:20:10,593 --> 00:20:13,181
I propose a partnership between the two of us.

348
00:20:13,593 --> 00:20:16,259
Let's become full-fledged Judgment officers together.

349
00:20:21,521 --> 00:20:22,159
Deal!

350
00:20:25,585 --> 00:20:26,523
Aww.

351
00:20:26,556 --> 00:20:28,014
What a sweet story.

352
00:20:30,461 --> 00:20:32,264
Hmm? Is something wrong?

353
00:20:32,894 --> 00:20:34,521
Oh. No, it's nothing.

354
00:20:35,239 --> 00:20:37,513
That must have been the promise she was talking about.

355
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:39,949
But how am I going to apologize to her now?

356
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,016
Hello? Shirai, here.

357
00:20:44,955 --> 00:20:45,344
Huh?

358
00:20:46,105 --> 00:20:47,296
Uiharu did what?

359
00:20:47,987 --> 00:20:51,342
Well, she figured out where those car
thieves you lost track of earlier were.

360
00:20:51,387 --> 00:20:53,500
As soon as she did, she rushed right out of here.

361
00:20:53,593 --> 00:20:55,846
After what happened, she's determined to find them.

362
00:20:56,268 --> 00:20:58,841
So, Shirai, what are you going to do about it?

363
00:21:00,566 --> 00:21:01,634
I am going to...

364
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:06,359
Follow your convictions and act
in the way you believe is right,

365
00:21:06,384 --> 00:21:07,961
never straying from justice.

366
00:21:08,056 --> 00:21:08,620
That it?

367
00:21:09,104 --> 00:21:09,765
Go on.

368
00:21:10,409 --> 00:21:12,013
You can still work together.

369
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,277
Even if you do butt heads sometimes.

370
00:21:30,616 --> 00:21:32,377
Hey! What are you dawdling around for?

371
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:37,798
If you keep moving at this rate, the two of us
will never become full-fledged officers together!

372
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:44,304
Always in such a hurry.

373
00:21:45,301 --> 00:21:46,301
A happy ending.

374
00:21:46,384 --> 00:21:47,720
I'm not too surprised.

375
00:21:47,968 --> 00:21:50,588
Fights don't tend to last very
long when you're that young.

376
00:21:51,167 --> 00:21:52,555
Sh... Shirai,

377
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:54,730
don't you think we should slow down a little?

378
00:21:54,889 --> 00:21:56,754
Forget it. I'm going on ahead.

379
00:21:57,211 --> 00:21:58,836
Hey! No teleporting!

380
00:21:58,861 --> 00:22:00,033
That's not fair!

381
00:23:30,473 --> 00:23:32,430
It's about time for Judgment to step up.

382
00:23:32,455 --> 00:23:33,825
You think this job is easy?

383
00:23:33,875 --> 00:23:34,873
Let's see you try it.

384
00:23:34,926 --> 00:23:35,920
There's an idea!

385
00:23:35,945 --> 00:23:38,111
Next episode, "Sissy's First Time"!

386
00:23:38,136 --> 00:23:39,714
You don't have to say it like that!
