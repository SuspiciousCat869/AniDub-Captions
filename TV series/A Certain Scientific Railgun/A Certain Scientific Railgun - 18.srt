1
00:00:01,206 --> 00:00:02,118
Kuroko!

2
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:17,583
Use of your abilities inside the dorms is prohibited...

3
00:00:17,721 --> 00:00:19,689
How many times do I have to say it?

4
00:00:20,141 --> 00:00:21,842
Right, Misaka?

5
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:56,305
Give me a break.

6
00:01:56,461 --> 00:01:57,551
What an old bat...

7
00:01:57,664 --> 00:01:59,799
All she ever talks about is rules!

8
00:02:00,432 --> 00:02:03,054
Well, that is kind of her job description, you know.

9
00:02:03,315 --> 00:02:06,160
Is there nothing we can do to
make her chill out a little bit?

10
00:02:06,328 --> 00:02:10,214
I was just teasing you yesterday; it's
not like I was doing any harm to anyone.

11
00:02:10,281 --> 00:02:13,535
Why am I always the one she
chooses to vent her frustration on?

12
00:02:13,848 --> 00:02:15,807
I'm telling you, she's a bitter old maid.

13
00:02:16,247 --> 00:02:17,929
I wouldn't let her hear you say that.

14
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:20,334
That's the truth of the situation, though, isn't it?

15
00:02:20,489 --> 00:02:24,513
She's the head resident of a girls' dormitory,
a job that offers zero contact with men.

16
00:02:24,538 --> 00:02:25,904
No wonder she's still single.

17
00:02:26,003 --> 00:02:27,415
But she shouldn't take it out on us,

18
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,608
it isn't our fault she's heartless and alone.

19
00:02:32,688 --> 00:02:34,269
That was just her, wasn't it?

20
00:02:34,887 --> 00:02:36,400
Yeah, but what is she up to?

21
00:02:37,203 --> 00:02:38,222
There's something off here.

22
00:02:38,247 --> 00:02:39,880
She's dressed like a normal person.

23
00:02:40,206 --> 00:02:44,162
Now that you mention it, I've noticed that
she goes out somewhere whenever she has time off.

24
00:02:44,589 --> 00:02:45,643
To meet a man!

25
00:02:46,158 --> 00:02:46,666
Huh?

26
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,143
Come on. This is the perfect opportunity!

27
00:02:49,168 --> 00:02:50,575
Kuroko, where are you going?

28
00:02:55,513 --> 00:02:57,470
So... do you have a plan, here?

29
00:02:57,495 --> 00:03:00,752
Oh, yes. We're going to follow her
and get leverage to use against her.

30
00:03:00,956 --> 00:03:01,831
Leverage? Like what?

31
00:03:01,914 --> 00:03:03,295
It must be a blind date...

32
00:03:03,664 --> 00:03:08,411
I can't imagine that somebody would willingly go out
with such an inhuman harpy after actually meeting her.

33
00:03:08,665 --> 00:03:11,124
Although, whoever set her up must be quite a gambler.

34
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:13,845
What are the chances of this
matchmaking foray turning out well?

35
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:17,529
Oh! Perhaps her date lost a bet
and has to go out with her as payment.

36
00:03:18,779 --> 00:03:20,693
I think that's taking it a little far.

37
00:03:23,906 --> 00:03:25,325
Odd place for a blind date.

38
00:03:30,204 --> 00:03:31,154
I see now.

39
00:03:31,704 --> 00:03:33,691
Her mystery man must be Italian...

40
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:36,306
An Italian man named Marco!

41
00:03:36,331 --> 00:03:38,338
Okay, now you're just making stuff up.

42
00:03:51,847 --> 00:03:53,488
School District 13...

43
00:03:53,878 --> 00:03:54,933
All this way?

44
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:56,675
What on earth is she doing here?

45
00:03:57,326 --> 00:03:59,781
How long do you plan to follow her, anyway?

46
00:04:00,033 --> 00:04:03,109
Until I get to see her darling Marco with my own eyes.

47
00:04:03,134 --> 00:04:04,862
Yes, of course. "Marco."

48
00:04:16,306 --> 00:04:18,181
Ah... hey look, Auntie's here!

49
00:04:18,206 --> 00:04:20,622
Best be careful who you're calling Auntie, young man...

50
00:04:20,989 --> 00:04:23,942
If you want some of this yummy
food, you should call me Big Sister.

51
00:04:24,238 --> 00:04:25,904
Wow! It's pizza!

52
00:04:26,592 --> 00:04:28,145
Now, now, there's no need to push.

53
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:29,638
I've brought enough for everybody.

54
00:04:31,081 --> 00:04:32,045
No way.

55
00:04:32,427 --> 00:04:34,947
This is Asunaro Park Children's Orphanage...

56
00:04:35,789 --> 00:04:38,325
It says here that this is a Child Error facility.

57
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:42,787
Huh? That's the term they use for kids who
are left in Academy City without any family.

58
00:04:46,571 --> 00:04:48,580
As always, thanks so much for coming.

59
00:04:48,802 --> 00:04:49,738
It's nothing.

60
00:04:50,109 --> 00:04:52,568
The little ones always look forward to seeing you...

61
00:04:52,755 --> 00:04:54,824
"When's Big Sister coming?" they ask.

62
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:57,239
I'm sure I enjoy it more than they do.

63
00:04:57,644 --> 00:04:59,286
The help you give us is priceless...

64
00:04:59,454 --> 00:05:02,753
I can't tell you how much we
appreciate having you volunteer here.

65
00:05:03,118 --> 00:05:05,455
I hope you'll continue coming for a long time.

66
00:05:05,691 --> 00:05:06,757
Yes, I will.

67
00:05:06,878 --> 00:05:09,097
Big Sister, you're gonna eat with us, aren't you?

68
00:05:09,122 --> 00:05:10,291
Just try to stop me.

69
00:05:13,782 --> 00:05:15,561
I've never seen her act like this before...

70
00:05:15,586 --> 00:05:16,681
She's so happy.

71
00:05:17,173 --> 00:05:18,697
This is unusual indeed...

72
00:05:18,898 --> 00:05:22,455
I never would have guessed that this is
what she'd choose to do on her days off.

73
00:05:23,647 --> 00:05:29,368
To think I had no idea that the noble Head Resident had
such a tender heart buried underneath her rough exterior.

74
00:05:29,703 --> 00:05:30,455
"Noble"?

75
00:05:30,848 --> 00:05:33,030
Compared to her, we are selfish children...

76
00:05:33,274 --> 00:05:35,906
I am ashamed to think of all the horrible things we said.

77
00:05:35,997 --> 00:05:37,623
calling her a bitter old harpy!

78
00:05:37,996 --> 00:05:38,696
Idiots!

79
00:05:38,787 --> 00:05:40,706
Uh, you're the one who said all that...

80
00:05:41,112 --> 00:05:41,992
Hold on...

81
00:05:43,003 --> 00:05:47,522
It's not fair for them to make us do community
service because we had lousy test scores.

82
00:05:48,164 --> 00:05:50,382
This could be a valuable life experience.

83
00:05:50,789 --> 00:05:54,276
Besides, it's fun playing with the
children and seeing their smiling faces.

84
00:05:54,467 --> 00:05:56,397
Yeah... I guess you're right about that.

85
00:05:56,628 --> 00:05:58,367
Oh... excuse me... do you have a moment?

86
00:05:59,779 --> 00:06:01,601
I want to introduce you to our director...

87
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:05,056
Saten, Uiharu, this is Miss Kazuko Shigenomori.

88
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:06,486
It's a pleasure to meet you...

89
00:06:06,648 --> 00:06:08,757
Are these two girls students of yours, Daigo?

90
00:06:08,782 --> 00:06:09,412
They are.

91
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:12,159
I want to thank you in advance for all your help today.

92
00:06:12,184 --> 00:06:13,934
Not at all. We're happy to be here.

93
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:14,900
By the way...

94
00:06:15,156 --> 00:06:17,722
are those two over there friends of yours by any chance?

95
00:06:17,747 --> 00:06:18,205
Huh?

96
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:24,522
What a coincidence running into you guys here, huh?

97
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:26,731
Are you guys volunteering, too?

98
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:28,995
Oh... um... y'see...

99
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,378
Hey... isn't that the head resident of your dorm in there?

100
00:06:33,195 --> 00:06:34,850
Did the three of you come together?

101
00:06:35,147 --> 00:06:39,092
Oh, no... Certain circumstances
led us here, but I won't go into it.

102
00:06:39,117 --> 00:06:41,311
Okay... nicely done, everybody.

103
00:06:41,754 --> 00:06:42,279
Hello!

104
00:06:43,582 --> 00:06:44,947
It's nice to see you again.

105
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:47,394
Oh... it's nice to see you, too.

106
00:06:47,811 --> 00:06:50,312
A couple of my students came to volunteer today...

107
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:52,464
They're new, so they might make some mistakes...

108
00:06:52,489 --> 00:06:54,420
Please feel free to tell them if they do.

109
00:06:54,727 --> 00:06:55,817
Oh, no, no...

110
00:06:55,922 --> 00:06:58,637
I'm sure that none of your
charges could do anything wrong...

111
00:06:58,831 --> 00:06:59,717
Don't be silly...

112
00:06:59,946 --> 00:07:03,524
Plus... I don't have much experience
when it comes to scolding students.

113
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:07,884
Wow... I had no idea your head resident volunteered here.

114
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:10,093
Maybe Mr. Daigo asked her to help out.

115
00:07:10,929 --> 00:07:13,915
The man she's talking to in there is called Mr. Daigo?

116
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:16,769
Yes, that's his name. He's our homeroom teacher.

117
00:07:16,794 --> 00:07:19,351
Finally, her mystery man has been revealed to us.

118
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:21,257
Huh? What are you talking about?

119
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:25,293
Isn't it obvious? Our head resident has
fallen head over heels in love with him!

120
00:07:25,388 --> 00:07:27,166
Wha... In love?!

121
00:07:28,929 --> 00:07:29,901
I have a mission.

122
00:07:30,051 --> 00:07:32,808
I will see to it that her love does not go unrequited...

123
00:07:32,949 --> 00:07:34,116
I will not fail her!

124
00:07:34,305 --> 00:07:36,003
I don't know about this, Kuroko...

125
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:38,775
I do! I think it could be a lot of fun.

126
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,001
I'll help, too. She deserves a happy ending!

127
00:07:41,397 --> 00:07:43,614
You guys're getting on board with this idea, too?

128
00:07:43,804 --> 00:07:46,513
I hope you realize it's not going to be a simple task.

129
00:07:46,538 --> 00:07:50,622
Fortunately, Shirai has a devious
talent for creating romantic situations.

130
00:07:51,748 --> 00:07:53,561
How about I give you a smack on the head?

131
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:55,674
It's no good to ask after you've done it...

132
00:07:55,873 --> 00:07:57,127
That wasn't nice.

133
00:07:57,247 --> 00:07:59,026
Okay, that's enough standing around...

134
00:07:59,284 --> 00:08:00,735
Let's hold a strategy meeting!

135
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:07,957
Oh, noble head resident...

136
00:08:08,332 --> 00:08:09,624
We welcome you home.

137
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,264
What do you think you're doing?

138
00:08:14,331 --> 00:08:16,259
You do not care for a moist towel?

139
00:08:16,284 --> 00:08:18,579
Then please allow me to take your bag for you.

140
00:08:18,975 --> 00:08:19,937
Oh, look at that...

141
00:08:19,962 --> 00:08:22,503
I see you've chosen a higher-end beverage than normal...

142
00:08:22,528 --> 00:08:24,482
Did something special happen today?

143
00:08:24,595 --> 00:08:26,516
What kind of joke are you playing?

144
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:28,741
I don't mind punishing you again.

145
00:08:30,618 --> 00:08:31,855
No joke, ma'am.

146
00:08:31,937 --> 00:08:34,429
Helping you in your time of need is my only desire.

147
00:08:34,454 --> 00:08:37,847
If you have anything you need to get
off your chest, you can confide in me.

148
00:08:37,872 --> 00:08:38,736
Anything at all!

149
00:08:39,142 --> 00:08:41,087
Discuss my personal life with you?

150
00:08:41,112 --> 00:08:42,716
No way, not a chance...

151
00:08:42,956 --> 00:08:43,956
Don't be absurd.

152
00:08:44,086 --> 00:08:44,955
Forgive me...

153
00:08:45,141 --> 00:08:48,099
I only want to be of service to my noble role model.

154
00:08:48,501 --> 00:08:50,406
I can tell when you're up to something, Shirai...

155
00:08:50,675 --> 00:08:51,391
What is it?

156
00:08:51,693 --> 00:08:53,386
I'm not up to anything at all...

157
00:08:53,808 --> 00:08:56,126
I'm sorry I've given you reason to think so.

158
00:08:56,151 --> 00:08:59,622
It's just that today I had the chance to
see you playing with the poor young orphans,

159
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:01,689
and I gained so much respect for you!

160
00:09:02,668 --> 00:09:04,007
How do you know about that?

161
00:09:04,445 --> 00:09:05,903
That's not even the half of it.

162
00:09:05,937 --> 00:09:07,774
I know about Mr. Daigo, too...

163
00:09:07,909 --> 00:09:09,393
Right? We know it all?

164
00:09:09,503 --> 00:09:11,445
Oh, uh... well... Uh... huh!

165
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:14,628
All right, you! What exactly do you know about Daigo?

166
00:09:14,824 --> 00:09:17,688
Won't you let us help you this once, Head Resident?

167
00:09:17,926 --> 00:09:19,029
Help how?

168
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,181
We could play the part of Cupid for you and Mr. Daigo.

169
00:09:22,206 --> 00:09:23,331
Wouldn't that be great?

170
00:09:23,356 --> 00:09:26,228
No! Never! Why would I need Cupid?

171
00:09:26,253 --> 00:09:29,088
Besides... I'm not even interested in Mr. Daigo.

172
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,377
Ma'am surely you do not want to
deny the true desires of your heart.

173
00:09:32,402 --> 00:09:33,500
That would be tragic!

174
00:09:33,616 --> 00:09:37,455
You may as well admit that what you want
from Mr. Daigo goes beyond friendship...

175
00:09:37,561 --> 00:09:38,975
It's no use saying otherwise.

176
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,404
I can see right through you.

177
00:09:40,627 --> 00:09:43,136
While you're little, what gives you the right to say that?

178
00:09:43,521 --> 00:09:45,477
It's been twenty-nine long years.

179
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,954
Hasn't the time come to know the joys of love?

180
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:49,473
Isn't that what you deserve?

181
00:09:50,392 --> 00:09:51,948
Just... go away!

182
00:09:52,136 --> 00:09:55,279
Are you sure you want to spend
the rest of your life as an old maid?

183
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:57,226
K... Kuroko...

184
00:09:57,996 --> 00:10:01,181
If you let this chance pass you
by, you may not get another one...

185
00:10:01,219 --> 00:10:03,764
I have my own experience with unrequited love.

186
00:10:03,957 --> 00:10:07,172
Please, Head Resident, allow me to
help you make your dreams come true!

187
00:10:07,197 --> 00:10:09,155
Er... don't you think that's enough?

188
00:10:09,468 --> 00:10:09,953
Eh?

189
00:10:11,406 --> 00:10:12,215
You mean it?

190
00:10:15,164 --> 00:10:16,357
This isn't just some trick?

191
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:17,541
You really wanna help me?

192
00:10:17,889 --> 00:10:19,247
Yes. I really do.

193
00:10:19,699 --> 00:10:20,193
Eh...

194
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:21,900
Huh?!

195
00:10:24,851 --> 00:10:27,860
These lovely girls have volunteered
to play with you this afternoon...

196
00:10:28,229 --> 00:10:30,576
Let's give them a nice, warm welcome, okay?

197
00:10:30,816 --> 00:10:32,834
It's nice to meet all of you.

198
00:10:33,494 --> 00:10:34,780
What a great turnout...

199
00:10:34,805 --> 00:10:36,727
I'm so glad your students could come along...

200
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,928
You must be really proud of
them for volunteering like this.

201
00:10:39,953 --> 00:10:42,613
Oh... yes... I'm very proud.

202
00:10:42,638 --> 00:10:44,525
Mr. Daigo!

203
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:45,276
Yes?

204
00:10:45,642 --> 00:10:46,214
What is it?

205
00:10:48,134 --> 00:10:51,289
So... what's this brilliant plan for me, Shirai? What now?

206
00:10:51,329 --> 00:10:53,356
You just relax and take it easy for now...

207
00:10:53,467 --> 00:10:56,731
Your love life is in very capable hands, I can assure you.

208
00:10:56,838 --> 00:10:59,728
All right. We're going to put
the plan into action immediately.

209
00:11:00,435 --> 00:11:01,681
So there is a plan?

210
00:11:01,706 --> 00:11:03,081
Oh... well...

211
00:11:06,871 --> 00:11:09,443
Mission accomplished! I've got
her all settled in the kitchen.

212
00:11:09,715 --> 00:11:11,334
Good. Excellent work, Saten...

213
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,496
With that done, phase one of
the plan is officially complete.

214
00:11:14,784 --> 00:11:15,887
On to phase two.

215
00:11:16,616 --> 00:11:19,670
In which we get the head resident
and Mr. Daigo alone together.

216
00:11:19,848 --> 00:11:24,277
Having them participate in a collaborative
activity is a surefire way to bring them closer...

217
00:11:24,621 --> 00:11:25,835
Our plan needs a name...

218
00:11:25,888 --> 00:11:28,200
"Operation Fruits of Love" is now in effect.

219
00:11:28,225 --> 00:11:29,665
"Fruits of Love"? Are you sure...?

220
00:11:29,752 --> 00:11:31,643
Doesn't that make it sound improper?

221
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,472
Well... the fruits of love are children, aren't they?

222
00:11:34,687 --> 00:11:35,924
Hey, Big Sisters...

223
00:11:36,156 --> 00:11:37,140
Come play with us!

224
00:11:37,461 --> 00:11:38,919
Well, you heard the girl, Sissy...

225
00:11:38,992 --> 00:11:40,327
Why don't you go and play with them?

226
00:11:41,096 --> 00:11:43,347
You remember us discussing this part, don't you?

227
00:11:43,372 --> 00:11:45,547
Oh... well, okay then.

228
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,611
All right, everyone! Let's go!

229
00:11:53,281 --> 00:11:54,656
Oh, Shirai... what am I...

230
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:55,970
Sorry to keep you waiting.

231
00:11:57,597 --> 00:11:59,372
Daigo, hi... Why are you?

232
00:11:59,543 --> 00:12:00,004
Well...

233
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,111
I wanted to come help you with the cake.

234
00:12:03,164 --> 00:12:07,552
I have to admit, I'm really impressed that you're
going to make a cake from scratch for the birthday party.

235
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,000
Homemade is always better.

236
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:11,143
Well... uh...

237
00:12:11,245 --> 00:12:13,337
Well, how about I get started on the icing?

238
00:12:13,744 --> 00:12:17,214
I know I don't look it, but I am
fairly good at cooking... or I try.

239
00:12:18,884 --> 00:12:21,888
There's something about baking a
cake from scratch that feels so homey.

240
00:12:21,913 --> 00:12:23,053
Oh... Yeah...

241
00:12:23,265 --> 00:12:24,468
It may sound silly...

242
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:26,271
but this is the kind of thing I love.

243
00:12:27,729 --> 00:12:30,443
It's so fulfilling... the act of creating something.

244
00:12:31,419 --> 00:12:33,167
Sorry, I realize I'm blabbering...

245
00:12:33,302 --> 00:12:34,550
but this is so nice.

246
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:36,944
It's just... I'm hoping to get married someday...

247
00:12:37,113 --> 00:12:40,803
and standing in the kitchen like this
with my wife is a favorite daydream of mine.

248
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:44,927
I wonder how they're getting along so far.

249
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:48,638
Come to think of it, we just assumed that
things were going to go well between them...

250
00:12:49,106 --> 00:12:51,315
What do we do if it doesn't go as we planned?

251
00:12:51,349 --> 00:12:52,515
Well, you see...

252
00:12:53,207 --> 00:12:55,692
Hey, that sounded like the head resident, didn't it?

253
00:12:55,832 --> 00:12:56,817
What in the world?

254
00:12:56,841 --> 00:12:57,347
Calm down.

255
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,728
There's nothing to worry about...

256
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:02,834
Naturally, I made sure to prepare contingency
plans should anything unexpected happen.

257
00:13:04,233 --> 00:13:07,436
Ah! What's going on? It looks like something exploded!

258
00:13:07,643 --> 00:13:08,588
What is all this?

259
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:10,645
Uh. I can explain.

260
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:11,687
It was all my fault...

261
00:13:11,933 --> 00:13:14,244
I was trying to open a bag of flour, and it just...

262
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,510
All of this from opening a bag of flour?

263
00:13:18,528 --> 00:13:19,991
Hey... It'll be okay...

264
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,242
We can start over...

265
00:13:21,386 --> 00:13:22,449
No problem... Right?

266
00:13:24,366 --> 00:13:25,979
Right... thank you, Daigo.

267
00:13:26,004 --> 00:13:29,113
Unfortunately, there isn't enough
time for that before the birthday party.

268
00:13:29,206 --> 00:13:32,454
So, maybe you could run out and get us a replacement cake.

269
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:35,193
Oh... I guess you're right... Okay...

270
00:13:35,218 --> 00:13:36,497
If you could wait one sec.

271
00:13:36,522 --> 00:13:39,887
Our noble head resident here knows of
a cake shop that should work perfectly!

272
00:13:39,912 --> 00:13:41,145
Sh... Shirai!

273
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:43,028
It's fine. Don't be nervous...

274
00:13:43,223 --> 00:13:45,515
These two will go along with you for moral support.

275
00:13:46,717 --> 00:13:47,459
You're coming?

276
00:13:47,859 --> 00:13:49,471
Yes! We're at your service!

277
00:13:49,592 --> 00:13:50,822
Hurry! Run away!

278
00:13:51,725 --> 00:13:53,753
This is crazy. What am I doing here?

279
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:55,183
Hah! I caught you!

280
00:13:55,424 --> 00:13:57,622
Yeah... I was no match for you...

281
00:13:57,735 --> 00:13:59,942
and I guess that means it's my turn to be "it."

282
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:01,387
Now... run!

283
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:04,326
Run as fast as you can, or I'm gonna catch you!

284
00:14:07,935 --> 00:14:09,746
I would do anything to save them...

285
00:14:09,973 --> 00:14:12,106
Anything in the entire world!

286
00:14:12,131 --> 00:14:17,122
The whole city can hate and revile me. I don't
care! I'm not going to let anything stop me now!

287
00:14:19,563 --> 00:14:20,701
Child Errors...

288
00:14:21,549 --> 00:14:21,942
Huh...

289
00:14:22,662 --> 00:14:24,389
Happy Birthday, Meg and Kei!!

290
00:14:24,477 --> 00:14:26,215
Hip, hip, hooray!

291
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,655
It ended up being a big ordeal.

292
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,229
First we went the wrong way...

293
00:14:30,674 --> 00:14:32,062
Then we got chased by a dog...

294
00:14:32,398 --> 00:14:34,010
And nearly fell into the river.

295
00:14:34,222 --> 00:14:35,185
How could that happen?

296
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:36,577
You were just buying a cake.

297
00:14:36,805 --> 00:14:38,097
Well... who cares?

298
00:14:38,122 --> 00:14:39,690
It turned out all right in the end.

299
00:14:39,715 --> 00:14:40,847
All right, everybody...

300
00:14:40,872 --> 00:14:41,926
Time to dig in!

301
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,229
Yeah!

302
00:14:43,254 --> 00:14:44,317
This is nice, huh?

303
00:14:44,493 --> 00:14:46,303
Everybody's having such a good time.

304
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:48,001
I'm sorry...

305
00:14:48,497 --> 00:14:51,028
I... I wish I could've been more helpful today.

306
00:14:51,174 --> 00:14:51,776
Oh, hey...

307
00:14:53,021 --> 00:14:54,764
I haven't seen you without your glasses.

308
00:14:54,789 --> 00:14:55,652
It looks nice.

309
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:59,370
Oh... I mean... you look good with them on, too...

310
00:14:59,526 --> 00:15:01,549
but you also look pretty when you take them off.

311
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,456
Look at that! They're being
all lovey-dovey with each other!

312
00:15:06,481 --> 00:15:08,460
Hah! Lovey-dovey!

313
00:15:10,551 --> 00:15:13,264
Hey! You shouldn't be teasing grownups like that!

314
00:15:13,289 --> 00:15:14,204
That's just silly...

315
00:15:14,252 --> 00:15:18,144
For one thing, I'm certain that your Big
Sister would have no interest in me whatsoever.

316
00:15:18,175 --> 00:15:19,193
I've got an idea.

317
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:22,219
How about you describe your ideal woman for us, Mr. Daigo?

318
00:15:22,484 --> 00:15:24,427
Huh... well, let me see...

319
00:15:24,872 --> 00:15:26,804
Someone I could respect, I guess.

320
00:15:26,836 --> 00:15:28,392
Someone you can respect, huh?

321
00:15:28,481 --> 00:15:29,768
And what would that require?

322
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:34,955
Well... she would really have to be somebody who
puts the needs of others before her own, you know?

323
00:15:38,285 --> 00:15:39,046
Earthquake?!

324
00:15:41,318 --> 00:15:43,065
Right... okay... everybody stay...

325
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:46,354
Listen up! Everybody take cover under the table.

326
00:15:48,504 --> 00:15:50,876
Good! now stay there and keep qui...

327
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:53,295
Be careful!

328
00:15:58,127 --> 00:15:59,004
Has it stopped?

329
00:15:59,331 --> 00:16:01,110
We've had a lot of these lately.

330
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:02,683
Thankfully it was small...

331
00:16:02,914 --> 00:16:03,754
We'll be fine.

332
00:16:04,144 --> 00:16:04,622
Oh, no!

333
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:09,363
Miss! Are you two okay?

334
00:16:09,388 --> 00:16:12,239
Young man! Didn't I tell everyone to get under the table?

335
00:16:12,364 --> 00:16:14,330
Yes... I'm sorry, Big Sister.

336
00:16:14,896 --> 00:16:17,055
It'll be okay. Are you sure you're not hurt?

337
00:16:18,552 --> 00:16:19,391
Oh, wow.

338
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:22,251
You were fantastic.

339
00:16:22,549 --> 00:16:23,759
You have my respect.

340
00:16:26,094 --> 00:16:28,344
No, really... it was nothing.

341
00:16:32,952 --> 00:16:34,183
You were fantastic.

342
00:16:35,033 --> 00:16:36,313
You have my respect.

343
00:16:37,917 --> 00:16:38,741
No, really...

344
00:16:38,765 --> 00:16:39,403
And so...

345
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,533
I would like to marry you.

346
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:43,702
Say yes, and we'll cook together forever.

347
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:45,695
Yes.

348
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:53,014
I am so sorry.

349
00:16:53,611 --> 00:16:55,278
I know I was out past curfew.

350
00:16:58,646 --> 00:16:59,822
These things happen...

351
00:17:00,157 --> 00:17:02,491
Just try to be more punctual next time.

352
00:17:02,796 --> 00:17:03,993
That's unbelievable...

353
00:17:04,201 --> 00:17:07,600
I've never seen the head resident
overlook a curfew infraction before.

354
00:17:07,721 --> 00:17:10,509
It was inevitable, I suppose. Love changes a person.

355
00:17:12,587 --> 00:17:13,505
Yes, hello...?

356
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:15,441
Oh! Daigo!

357
00:17:16,717 --> 00:17:19,152
Huh? There's something you wanna ask me?

358
00:17:19,423 --> 00:17:20,703
And you're sure you want me?

359
00:17:21,164 --> 00:17:22,806
It has to be me, you say?

360
00:17:23,198 --> 00:17:24,325
All right. I'll be there.

361
00:17:27,567 --> 00:17:29,665
What does he need to ask her so urgently?

362
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:30,991
Isn't it obvious?

363
00:17:31,016 --> 00:17:33,708
After today, there's only one thing it could possibly be.

364
00:17:33,733 --> 00:17:34,065
Huh?

365
00:17:37,165 --> 00:17:38,385
He's going to propose?

366
00:17:38,544 --> 00:17:40,239
I can't believe it's really happening!

367
00:17:40,572 --> 00:17:43,067
This is so exciting, I can hardly stand it!

368
00:17:43,348 --> 00:17:45,681
Why would he choose a family restaurant like this?

369
00:17:45,706 --> 00:17:46,899
It is pretty pathetic...

370
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:50,830
I'm guessing he's never had a girlfriend
before so he doesn't have any idea what to do.

371
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:53,597
Obviously when a man proposes to a woman,

372
00:17:53,622 --> 00:17:57,113
it should be at sunset in a fancy,
romantic restaurant on the beach!

373
00:17:57,328 --> 00:18:00,529
No... a rooftop restaurant with a view of the city...

374
00:18:00,674 --> 00:18:01,929
Right... Misaka?

375
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:03,500
Yes, and then...

376
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:05,766
after she's accepted his gallant proposal...

377
00:18:05,819 --> 00:18:08,825
they climb on top of a mountain
and watch a fireworks display!

378
00:18:10,237 --> 00:18:11,597
That's going a little far.

379
00:18:11,717 --> 00:18:12,415
What?

380
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:13,616
So, anyway...

381
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,981
You said there's something you wanted to ask me?

382
00:18:16,816 --> 00:18:19,899
Yes... I guess I should just come right out and say it.

383
00:18:20,428 --> 00:18:20,988
Yes?

384
00:18:21,783 --> 00:18:22,968
I was wondering...

385
00:18:24,342 --> 00:18:27,289
How would you feel about marrying
somebody who is younger than you?

386
00:18:28,331 --> 00:18:29,321
M... Marrying...

387
00:18:30,483 --> 00:18:32,396
Someone... younger?

388
00:18:32,789 --> 00:18:34,390
Yes... for instance...

389
00:18:34,605 --> 00:18:35,590
someone like me.

390
00:18:36,989 --> 00:18:38,539
I've got you now!

391
00:18:41,927 --> 00:18:43,543
Well... I, uh...

392
00:18:43,642 --> 00:18:45,467
I don't really think age matters...

393
00:18:45,973 --> 00:18:48,088
not as long as you respect the person.

394
00:18:49,651 --> 00:18:50,400
I knew it...!

395
00:18:51,164 --> 00:18:54,103
I figured you would say that,
but I just wanted to make sure.

396
00:18:54,629 --> 00:18:57,376
Sorry for calling you out of the
blue to ask you something like that.

397
00:18:58,789 --> 00:18:59,236
No...

398
00:19:08,155 --> 00:19:09,919
Congratulations! Way to go!

399
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:12,358
You mean you were watching?

400
00:19:12,383 --> 00:19:14,633
Head Resident, I knew you had it in you!

401
00:19:14,658 --> 00:19:16,325
Now, you'll need to pick a venue...

402
00:19:16,428 --> 00:19:17,652
and meet his parents...

403
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:18,782
and then honeymoon!

404
00:19:18,827 --> 00:19:23,141
Shirai... I would appreciate it if you
would give me a hard pinch on the cheek.

405
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:23,578
Huh?

406
00:19:24,688 --> 00:19:27,463
If this is all just a dream, I'd like to wake up now.

407
00:19:28,246 --> 00:19:29,578
Well if you insist.

408
00:19:32,111 --> 00:19:34,572
Okay. That's enough, Shirai.

409
00:19:35,664 --> 00:19:36,901
Before you go...

410
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:39,959
There's one additional favor I need to ask of you.

411
00:19:49,209 --> 00:19:50,265
I, uh...

412
00:19:50,776 --> 00:19:53,038
I want to give him a proper answer.

413
00:19:58,757 --> 00:20:00,911
Around and around and around and around...

414
00:20:00,936 --> 00:20:01,936
Hello, Daigo...

415
00:20:01,961 --> 00:20:04,664
Around and around and around and around...

416
00:20:04,689 --> 00:20:06,981
Do you... have a sec?

417
00:20:08,314 --> 00:20:11,343
I can't put my finger on it, but there's
something different about you today.

418
00:20:12,328 --> 00:20:15,818
Um... about our conversation the other night...

419
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:18,667
Yes. I really appreciated that.

420
00:20:18,887 --> 00:20:21,957
I finally have the courage I
need, and it's all thanks to you.

421
00:20:24,346 --> 00:20:26,096
Oh! What's this?

422
00:20:26,973 --> 00:20:28,948
I'm going to propose to my girlfriend.

423
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:31,021
Girlfriend?

424
00:20:31,215 --> 00:20:31,997
That's right.

425
00:20:37,228 --> 00:20:38,686
And your girlfriend is...

426
00:20:38,864 --> 00:20:39,522
Yes...

427
00:20:40,826 --> 00:20:41,945
I was nervous.

428
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:45,101
But then you said age doesn't matter
as long as you respect the person...

429
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:46,379
and I knew you were right.

430
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:50,678
I can't tell you how grateful I am to you.

431
00:20:52,081 --> 00:20:52,990
Sure.

432
00:20:54,704 --> 00:20:55,970
It's no problem...

433
00:20:56,443 --> 00:20:57,541
I'm glad I could help.

434
00:21:00,348 --> 00:21:01,651
Congratulations...

435
00:21:02,152 --> 00:21:03,689
I wish you all the best.

436
00:21:22,464 --> 00:21:23,302
All right.

437
00:21:25,494 --> 00:21:28,321
Aww... I was sure it was going to work out for her.

438
00:21:29,093 --> 00:21:30,045
That's a shame.

439
00:21:30,983 --> 00:21:32,905
I bet she'll find someone else before long.

440
00:21:33,055 --> 00:21:34,230
Of course she will.

441
00:21:34,365 --> 00:21:35,757
She's a great person.

442
00:21:36,264 --> 00:21:37,411
Okay, everyone!

443
00:21:37,743 --> 00:21:39,404
What are we going to play today?

444
00:23:14,895 --> 00:23:17,472
No fair! I couldn't've been more than a second late!

445
00:23:17,497 --> 00:23:20,564
It doesn't matter if it's an hour,
a second, or a tenth of a second.

446
00:23:20,589 --> 00:23:22,448
Whatever the case, you broke curfew.

447
00:23:22,866 --> 00:23:25,370
I hope you're prepared to answer for that, Shirai.

448
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:26,554
Kuroko!

449
00:23:27,456 --> 00:23:28,882
Kuroko!!

450
00:23:30,379 --> 00:23:34,412
Now, Head Resident, I know you've suffered a
major disappointment, but don't let it get you down...

451
00:23:34,502 --> 00:23:38,095
Just think of those children looking up
at you with their sweet, angelic faces...

452
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,190
Mow them down!
