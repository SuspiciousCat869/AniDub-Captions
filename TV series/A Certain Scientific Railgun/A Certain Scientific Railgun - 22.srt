1
00:00:16,169 --> 00:00:17,002
Bye!

2
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:19,419
I'll miss you so much!

3
00:00:19,444 --> 00:00:21,185
I'm so sorry, Erii.

4
00:00:24,294 --> 00:00:25,238
But don't worry...

5
00:00:25,508 --> 00:00:26,968
We'll see each other again.

6
00:00:31,321 --> 00:00:32,098
Bye!

7
00:00:32,123 --> 00:00:33,810
See you later!

8
00:00:34,478 --> 00:00:35,370
See you!

9
00:00:35,455 --> 00:00:36,489
Bye, Banri!

10
00:00:37,768 --> 00:00:38,963
Take care of yourself.

11
00:02:10,907 --> 00:02:12,619
That's how Banri and I met.

12
00:02:13,207 --> 00:02:15,548
We were in the same Child Error facility.

13
00:02:16,834 --> 00:02:20,504
I'm really shy around other people,
so I don't make friends easily.

14
00:02:21,768 --> 00:02:25,017
But for some reason, it wasn't
as hard to be friends with Banri.

15
00:02:25,906 --> 00:02:29,292
Whenever she spoke to me, it
was always using our telepathy.

16
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,374
but then she was transferred to another facility.

17
00:02:33,864 --> 00:02:34,819
And that was it.

18
00:02:35,694 --> 00:02:36,521
But lately...

19
00:02:36,562 --> 00:02:38,610
I've been hearing Banri's voice again...

20
00:02:38,927 --> 00:02:40,437
just like when we were young.

21
00:02:41,502 --> 00:02:42,932
She's asking for help...

22
00:02:43,269 --> 00:02:45,046
telling me she's in a lot of pain.

23
00:02:46,188 --> 00:02:48,112
But I... I don't know why...

24
00:02:48,764 --> 00:02:50,932
and I have no idea where she is now.

25
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:53,204
I want to help her.

26
00:02:53,783 --> 00:02:55,390
But there's nothing I can do.

27
00:02:55,876 --> 00:02:59,013
I wish... I wish I knew where she was.

28
00:03:01,961 --> 00:03:03,160
It will be all right!

29
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:04,956
I'm sure you'll find her again.

30
00:03:05,376 --> 00:03:07,251
No... I'll find her for you!

31
00:03:07,779 --> 00:03:10,637
As a Judgment officer, that's the least that I can do.

32
00:03:11,877 --> 00:03:12,941
You really can?

33
00:03:13,965 --> 00:03:18,207
Yeah! Despite her appearance, Uiharu's
actually an excellent Judgment officer.

34
00:03:18,419 --> 00:03:20,035
"Despite my appearance"?

35
00:03:20,247 --> 00:03:21,917
Oh, sorry... my bad.

36
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:25,907
Anyway, just leave it to me, okay?

37
00:03:26,547 --> 00:03:28,440
Thank you so much!

38
00:03:29,808 --> 00:03:31,856
You must be tired after all this.

39
00:03:32,102 --> 00:03:33,602
You should get some rest.

40
00:03:33,627 --> 00:03:35,782
No. I'm fine, really.

41
00:03:37,491 --> 00:03:38,920
The Level Upper incident.

42
00:03:39,429 --> 00:03:40,061
You mean...

43
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:40,771
Yes.

44
00:03:41,101 --> 00:03:44,165
Harumi Kiyama was responsible, and I saw into her past.

45
00:03:44,748 --> 00:03:47,305
Haru'ue's friend, Edasaki, was in the flashback.

46
00:03:48,191 --> 00:03:52,030
An induced burst experiment to
analyze the law of runaway abilities.

47
00:03:52,555 --> 00:03:55,472
It's hard to believe such an
experiment would be conducted.

48
00:03:55,707 --> 00:04:00,711
I know. From what I can tell, the person in
charge of it all was an old researcher named Kihara.

49
00:04:00,736 --> 00:04:03,320
Kihara? Do you mean Gensei Kihara?

50
00:04:03,816 --> 00:04:05,004
I've never heard of him.

51
00:04:05,227 --> 00:04:06,370
He's a scientist...

52
00:04:06,399 --> 00:04:08,151
A famous one, in some respects.

53
00:04:08,502 --> 00:04:10,788
Though "mad scientist" might be more accurate.

54
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:12,058
I know some of his work.

55
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,362
He's not above human experimentation.

56
00:04:14,711 --> 00:04:16,905
His current whereabouts are unknown, however.

57
00:04:18,231 --> 00:04:20,576
If he actually carried out such an experiment...

58
00:04:20,641 --> 00:04:25,247
then it's entirely possible that the children he
used are the source of the recent poltergeisting.

59
00:04:25,773 --> 00:04:27,155
What do you mean exactly?

60
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:30,691
That all those child subjects have become runaway Espers.

61
00:04:31,977 --> 00:04:33,193
How's that possible.

62
00:04:33,218 --> 00:04:35,903
Kiyama was certain the children are asleep, even now.

63
00:04:35,928 --> 00:04:39,256
What if their abilities are out of
control while they're unconscious?

64
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:40,377
Oh, no.

65
00:04:40,599 --> 00:04:45,460
You think the interference isn't intentional, but
rather the accidental result of their unconscious state?

66
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:47,455
It is a possibility.

67
00:04:48,024 --> 00:04:50,060
Where are the children now, do you girls know?

68
00:04:50,085 --> 00:04:52,769
Antiskill has been searching
for them ever since the incident,

69
00:04:52,794 --> 00:04:54,894
but they still haven't discovered their location.

70
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:55,375
Oh.

71
00:04:56,185 --> 00:04:59,123
Well, it sounds like finding
these kids is our top priority.

72
00:04:59,631 --> 00:05:01,834
Now then, the lucky color of the day is pink.

73
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:06,097
That's a good sign, huh?

74
00:05:09,784 --> 00:05:11,154
Whoa... this is crazy!

75
00:05:11,538 --> 00:05:15,411
You're telling me that Edasaki, Haru'ue's
friend, was one of Kiyama's students...

76
00:05:15,436 --> 00:05:18,478
and that these children are the
ones causing the poltergeisting?

77
00:05:18,978 --> 00:05:21,004
Yes, that's the hypothesis, anyway.

78
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:25,136
Until we actually locate the children,
we can't know anything for certain, though.

79
00:05:25,297 --> 00:05:27,503
Okay, but how are we supposed to find them?

80
00:05:27,797 --> 00:05:28,831
Well, maybe...

81
00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:32,586
I see what you're getting at.

82
00:05:32,611 --> 00:05:34,521
We should use the computer to find where they are.

83
00:05:34,745 --> 00:05:36,259
That means you're up, Uiharu!

84
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:40,105
Right...? You'll look.

85
00:05:40,484 --> 00:05:41,896
Of course I'm going to look...

86
00:05:42,266 --> 00:05:43,576
but I don't like this.

87
00:05:45,324 --> 00:05:49,217
We've cleared Haru'ue, and now you turn
around and start suspecting her friend?

88
00:05:53,552 --> 00:05:55,319
That's it! You're being unreasonable!

89
00:06:05,193 --> 00:06:06,378
Those poor kids.

90
00:06:07,127 --> 00:06:07,927
They need help.

91
00:06:08,467 --> 00:06:09,342
They're pleading.

92
00:06:12,162 --> 00:06:12,924
Hey, Sissy?

93
00:06:13,682 --> 00:06:15,403
You've been in there for a long time.

94
00:06:15,593 --> 00:06:16,103
Yeah.

95
00:06:16,683 --> 00:06:18,303
I've got a lot to think about.

96
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:20,536
After today, I guess we all have.

97
00:06:21,099 --> 00:06:22,490
So what are you going to do?

98
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:24,930
Don't you want to make up with Uiharu?

99
00:06:26,405 --> 00:06:29,012
It's not like I don't understand why she's upset.

100
00:06:30,576 --> 00:06:31,349
But still...

101
00:06:32,127 --> 00:06:33,478
I'm a Judgment officer.

102
00:06:33,544 --> 00:06:35,678
I've done nothing more than duty requires.

103
00:06:37,151 --> 00:06:40,207
Uiharu feels betrayed because I investigated her friend.

104
00:06:42,294 --> 00:06:43,030
Even so...

105
00:06:43,305 --> 00:06:44,736
I'm sure she'll come around.

106
00:06:49,252 --> 00:06:50,552
She'll see that I just...

107
00:06:53,252 --> 00:06:56,367
Don't think I'm gonna let you come
in here just because we're talking!

108
00:06:56,392 --> 00:06:58,774
Huh? I thought it would be a perfect opportunity for...

109
00:06:58,799 --> 00:06:59,579
Get out!

110
00:07:02,113 --> 00:07:03,970
Here. I brought snacks.

111
00:07:05,701 --> 00:07:08,888
They're from a shop in District
Eight that's famous for its pastries.

112
00:07:09,383 --> 00:07:11,018
You went that far to get them?

113
00:07:11,211 --> 00:07:12,551
You'll understand why.

114
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:15,252
These are the best cakes in all of Academy City.

115
00:07:15,481 --> 00:07:17,334
Oh, I got the sweet bean filling.

116
00:07:17,419 --> 00:07:18,948
You have to go with the classic.

117
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:19,930
Wow...

118
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,680
That far and they're still warm?

119
00:07:22,461 --> 00:07:23,333
Actually...

120
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:26,534
That's because I used my ability on them.

121
00:07:27,967 --> 00:07:29,467
It doesn't sound that fancy,

122
00:07:29,492 --> 00:07:31,810
but I can maintain the temperature of things I touch.

123
00:07:31,995 --> 00:07:33,949
I can't handle anything that's really hot,

124
00:07:33,974 --> 00:07:36,664
so I just stick with moderately warm items, like pastry.

125
00:07:38,456 --> 00:07:41,653
I haven't told the others about this... not even Saten.

126
00:07:42,656 --> 00:07:43,736
But it's only fair.

127
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:47,175
You told me about your ability, so I told you about mine!

128
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:53,000
So... it's good?

129
00:07:55,496 --> 00:07:56,630
It's delicious.

130
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:01,938
It's so good.

131
00:08:04,585 --> 00:08:08,863
According to Kiyama's deposition, there
were ten human experimentation subjects.

132
00:08:09,387 --> 00:08:11,256
They were all put in a vegetative state.

133
00:08:11,484 --> 00:08:15,110
And then they were divided up and taken to
different treatment centers across the city.

134
00:08:15,178 --> 00:08:16,445
But they aren't there anymore?

135
00:08:16,758 --> 00:08:21,258
Right. They were transferred repeatedly, and
somewhere along the way, the trail vanishes.

136
00:08:22,372 --> 00:08:22,920
Yeah.

137
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:25,089
How about you take a quick break?

138
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:28,305
No, thank you.

139
00:08:38,891 --> 00:08:40,352
Saten... where are you going?

140
00:08:40,757 --> 00:08:42,455
Uh... I don't know.

141
00:08:44,786 --> 00:08:46,587
Well... why don't we get a drink?

142
00:08:49,437 --> 00:08:52,443
Thanks. It's just really hard to be around them right now.

143
00:08:52,836 --> 00:08:53,403
I know.

144
00:08:53,749 --> 00:08:56,081
I wish there wasn't so much tension between them.

145
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:00,388
We need to find Edasaki somehow.

146
00:09:01,266 --> 00:09:02,922
For Haru'ue's sake naturally...

147
00:09:03,076 --> 00:09:04,885
but for Uiharu's sake as well...

148
00:09:05,417 --> 00:09:07,753
and I'm sure it would make us feel better also.

149
00:09:09,592 --> 00:09:10,430
Absolutely.

150
00:09:12,363 --> 00:09:13,052
Who's that?

151
00:09:13,812 --> 00:09:14,903
Yes, Misaka here?

152
00:09:16,685 --> 00:09:18,366
Kiyama is out on bail?!

153
00:09:18,668 --> 00:09:19,263
Yes.

154
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:22,855
I went to speak with her at the detention
center about the child experiments,

155
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,906
but she'd been released.

156
00:09:24,686 --> 00:09:28,458
After everything she did, I can't believe
they would let her see the light of day!

157
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:32,152
I don't know the specifics of her
bail agreement... but it's a done deal.

158
00:09:33,969 --> 00:09:34,662
Crazy!

159
00:09:35,381 --> 00:09:38,443
I don't know how we'll ever be able
to locate the children without her.

160
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:39,722
Huh...

161
00:09:40,028 --> 00:09:41,759
Something about this doesn't make sense.

162
00:09:41,784 --> 00:09:45,260
Everything Kiyama did was for the
sole purpose of rescuing those children.

163
00:09:45,588 --> 00:09:48,748
Why would she go through all that just
to turn around and use them like this?

164
00:09:50,013 --> 00:09:51,372
It's not so surprising.

165
00:09:51,806 --> 00:09:56,082
She is the same one who exploited
students' desires to increase their abilities.

166
00:10:00,538 --> 00:10:01,570
I said no, thanks.

167
00:10:01,872 --> 00:10:03,612
How about you stop playing the martyr?

168
00:10:04,091 --> 00:10:05,448
Oh. I'm sorry.

169
00:10:08,587 --> 00:10:09,945
You've been at this for a while.

170
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:12,258
I'm surprised you haven't been
able to track them down yet.

171
00:10:12,794 --> 00:10:13,671
I'm not done.

172
00:10:14,131 --> 00:10:16,363
There's still more data that I need to trace.

173
00:10:19,508 --> 00:10:21,035
Hey... what's this, here?

174
00:10:21,601 --> 00:10:24,587
It's something about AIM Diffusion Field resonance.

175
00:10:24,612 --> 00:10:28,195
And how that's a possible cause
for mass outbreaks of RSPK syndrome.

176
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:30,596
Resonance?

177
00:10:30,841 --> 00:10:31,858
Yes, that's right.

178
00:10:31,992 --> 00:10:37,005
The way in which the AIM diffusion fields of
similarly-typed Espers resonate with each other.

179
00:10:38,643 --> 00:10:41,354
It starts with one runaway Esper being tampered with.

180
00:10:41,655 --> 00:10:45,476
Then, like a domino effect, other Espers
of a like type are triggered as well.

181
00:10:46,498 --> 00:10:49,511
The resonating Esper powers share general characteristics.

182
00:10:50,109 --> 00:10:52,196
Let's look at your ability as an example.

183
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:57,193
Similar types would include Espers who can
manipulate either electrical or magnetic fields.

184
00:10:58,086 --> 00:11:01,453
Which means there is a wide range
of Espers who could resonate with you.

185
00:11:01,803 --> 00:11:06,744
And that means a similarly wide range exists for
the ten child experiments who have gone missing.

186
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,955
Imagine if all of their runaway
abilities have been activated.

187
00:11:12,349 --> 00:11:15,357
Their sphere of influence among
other students would be huge.

188
00:11:15,776 --> 00:11:17,452
As high as seventy-eight percent.

189
00:11:18,137 --> 00:11:19,714
Really? Seventy-eight?!

190
00:11:20,044 --> 00:11:20,860
But then.

191
00:11:21,271 --> 00:11:25,492
We could see poltergeisting on such a large
scale that it would tear apart the entire city.

192
00:11:26,122 --> 00:11:28,201
All right, but who says this theory is correct?

193
00:11:28,226 --> 00:11:30,584
Take a closer look at the person who wrote this article.

194
00:11:31,368 --> 00:11:32,534
Gensei Kihara?

195
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:34,722
After what we learned earlier, I looked into him.

196
00:11:34,889 --> 00:11:38,298
His whereabouts are indeed
unknown, just as Therestina told us.

197
00:11:38,746 --> 00:11:42,239
All of the research facilities he
was associated with are shut down...

198
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:43,979
and his data has been scattered.

199
00:11:45,772 --> 00:11:47,227
What is it? Is something the matter?

200
00:11:47,252 --> 00:11:48,682
Huh? Oh, no.

201
00:11:49,012 --> 00:11:49,772
Not really.

202
00:11:53,998 --> 00:11:55,563
Ah! Oh, Sissy!

203
00:11:55,774 --> 00:11:57,399
Oh, you're so rough! No, please don't stop!

204
00:11:57,424 --> 00:12:00,861
If I had time, I'd slap her silly and
put a stop to whatever she's dreaming.

205
00:12:06,782 --> 00:12:07,567
I'm sorry.

206
00:12:14,026 --> 00:12:16,211
All right. My disguise is complete.

207
00:12:28,723 --> 00:12:31,235
If the power isn't on, I guess I didn't need a mask.

208
00:12:40,778 --> 00:12:41,500
I was right.

209
00:12:42,035 --> 00:12:42,746
This is it.

210
00:12:44,449 --> 00:12:45,903
For whatever good that does.

211
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,129
No, there is nothing left here.

212
00:12:51,968 --> 00:12:53,843
Yes. I'm pulling out now.

213
00:12:55,205 --> 00:12:55,904
It's her!

214
00:13:02,187 --> 00:13:02,937
You again.

215
00:13:03,232 --> 00:13:03,983
I knew it.

216
00:13:04,461 --> 00:13:05,603
Harumi Kiyama.

217
00:13:06,233 --> 00:13:07,251
Can I help you with something?

218
00:13:07,276 --> 00:13:09,394
Are you responsible for these latest events, too?

219
00:13:11,468 --> 00:13:12,994
What would you do if I was?

220
00:13:13,956 --> 00:13:15,123
Stop you, that's what!

221
00:13:21,145 --> 00:13:23,103
Hey! What the... What's happening?

222
00:13:23,456 --> 00:13:24,495
Well, that's that.

223
00:13:27,499 --> 00:13:28,676
Nice job back there...

224
00:13:29,109 --> 00:13:32,006
Sending an electric current
through a dead security system.

225
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:34,352
It's not like that's what I meant to happen.

226
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:36,074
But never mind that...

227
00:13:36,252 --> 00:13:37,441
What were you doing there?

228
00:13:37,623 --> 00:13:38,957
How did you get out on bail?

229
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:40,546
What are you planning now?

230
00:13:41,941 --> 00:13:44,524
This situation feels regrettably familiar to me.

231
00:13:44,655 --> 00:13:47,441
Being interrogated in my own car by a schoolgirl.

232
00:13:47,623 --> 00:13:48,106
Huh?

233
00:13:48,546 --> 00:13:49,332
Well, sorry.

234
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,533
But the questions will have to wait for later.

235
00:14:06,127 --> 00:14:07,647
What is this place?

236
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:08,623
Come this way.

237
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:18,904
What's that?

238
00:14:19,502 --> 00:14:22,660
If you've peeked through my memories,
you should know the answer to that question.

239
00:14:24,086 --> 00:14:24,893
These are them.

240
00:14:25,922 --> 00:14:27,147
These are my students.

241
00:14:29,538 --> 00:14:30,384
I was right.

242
00:14:30,894 --> 00:14:33,926
You are the one who's behind
all these poltergeisting incidents.

243
00:14:36,217 --> 00:14:36,818
I am.

244
00:14:37,852 --> 00:14:38,669
It's true.

245
00:14:39,332 --> 00:14:41,989
However, there is a rather long story behind it all.

246
00:14:43,016 --> 00:14:46,407
Oh, and... as you may have noticed, this is a hospital.

247
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,736
Please try to refrain from the use of electric shocks.

248
00:14:51,627 --> 00:14:52,810
I remember you!

249
00:14:54,067 --> 00:14:55,591
Long time, no see, huh?

250
00:14:56,669 --> 00:14:58,896
Will someone please tell me what's going on here?

251
00:15:01,672 --> 00:15:02,980
Gensei Kihara.

252
00:15:04,643 --> 00:15:07,174
It was with him that all of this first began.

253
00:15:07,714 --> 00:15:09,209
Consider these questions.

254
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:11,029
Why are we here?

255
00:15:11,461 --> 00:15:13,197
What is our ultimate purpose?

256
00:15:13,701 --> 00:15:17,369
For what reason was Academy City
designed and built in the first place?

257
00:15:17,902 --> 00:15:20,547
Yes... there is one fundamental reason.

258
00:15:20,907 --> 00:15:24,242
Creating a being who transcends mankind: A Level 6.

259
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:28,040
What you are looking at now
are the results of much research.

260
00:15:28,265 --> 00:15:33,425
Signal pathways form that differ from a normal
neural network within the brains of runaway Espers.

261
00:15:33,678 --> 00:15:37,113
Various neurotransmitters and
hormones are secreted abnormally.

262
00:15:37,669 --> 00:15:41,711
Through the process of extracting those
secretions and then condensing and refining them,

263
00:15:41,736 --> 00:15:44,303
we can produce an ability crystal such as this.

264
00:15:45,002 --> 00:15:48,410
And by administering this crystal
to a specially-selected Esper,

265
00:15:48,435 --> 00:15:51,143
we can produce the long sought after Level 6.

266
00:15:51,516 --> 00:15:55,592
Yes, the ability crystal will help us
realize the ultimate purpose of our city.

267
00:15:56,237 --> 00:15:57,665
The creation of SYSTEM.

268
00:15:57,991 --> 00:16:00,612
After all these years of stumbling through the dark

269
00:16:00,836 --> 00:16:03,980
we may at last find someone who attains the power of God

270
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:06,156
while still inhabiting a mortal body.

271
00:16:12,345 --> 00:16:13,529
You really believe it?

272
00:16:14,657 --> 00:16:18,236
That you'll be able to create a
Level 6 using your ability crystal.

273
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:19,779
Of course I believe it.

274
00:16:20,906 --> 00:16:21,898
And the price?

275
00:16:22,248 --> 00:16:24,385
Intentionally impairing consciousness...

276
00:16:24,723 --> 00:16:27,880
leaving the subjects vulnerable to serious side effects.

277
00:16:28,191 --> 00:16:31,107
My experiments have produced consistent results.

278
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:32,416
Is that so?

279
00:16:32,921 --> 00:16:34,816
And how many victims do you have?

280
00:16:35,866 --> 00:16:36,659
Victims?

281
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,567
My research produces answers, not victims.

282
00:16:39,908 --> 00:16:41,597
Don't be ridiculous.

283
00:16:43,761 --> 00:16:47,147
Perhaps he truly did not see the
harm he was causing with his work.

284
00:16:48,938 --> 00:16:50,683
But there were victims.

285
00:16:51,871 --> 00:16:55,624
The more I learned about the facts of
the case, the more convinced I became.

286
00:16:56,425 --> 00:16:58,836
Finally, there was no denying it.

287
00:17:00,176 --> 00:17:03,318
The Child Errors that Kiyama
was trying so desperately to save

288
00:17:03,343 --> 00:17:06,484
were used as test subjects for Kihara's ability crystal.

289
00:17:07,313 --> 00:17:09,395
The burst experiment I told you about.

290
00:17:09,877 --> 00:17:11,993
The one that analyzed runaway abilities...

291
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:13,604
that was part of it, too.

292
00:17:15,455 --> 00:17:19,310
The experiment you saw in my memory
was a dosing of the ability crystals.

293
00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:24,926
Crazy... all this to create a Level
6 which we barely know anything about?

294
00:17:26,454 --> 00:17:28,462
These poor kids have ended up like this.

295
00:17:28,846 --> 00:17:30,661
And that's the reason behind it?!

296
00:17:36,449 --> 00:17:38,464
And now I am doing what I can.

297
00:17:38,784 --> 00:17:41,522
I hope my talents as a doctor will allow me to save them.

298
00:17:41,841 --> 00:17:45,718
Luckily, it didn't take too much time
to get them all transferred into my care.

299
00:17:46,836 --> 00:17:49,921
My name carries a certain amount
of weight in this town, you see.

300
00:17:50,367 --> 00:17:53,820
However, I did need to speak to a
specialist about how to revive them.

301
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:56,612
That's how you made bail.

302
00:17:57,002 --> 00:17:58,414
He did me a great favor.

303
00:17:58,954 --> 00:18:00,241
I'll be forever grateful.

304
00:18:01,822 --> 00:18:03,822
Thanks to my access to this facility,

305
00:18:03,847 --> 00:18:06,208
I have a rough idea of how to revive the children.

306
00:18:06,841 --> 00:18:08,004
You can save them?

307
00:18:08,133 --> 00:18:10,688
Unfortunately, another problem has arisen.

308
00:18:11,629 --> 00:18:12,317
What's that?

309
00:18:12,584 --> 00:18:14,216
As they approach awakening...

310
00:18:14,502 --> 00:18:18,252
their AIM diffusion field readings have abnormal values.

311
00:18:18,277 --> 00:18:19,016
Which means?

312
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,334
Their powers are out of control.

313
00:18:21,845 --> 00:18:25,673
They've triggered cases of
multiple simultaneous RSPK Syndrome.

314
00:18:26,086 --> 00:18:26,761
But why?

315
00:18:27,821 --> 00:18:30,678
It seems Kihara's research hasn't stopped entirely.

316
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,072
If he was using the ability
crystal that I knew he had developed,

317
00:18:34,127 --> 00:18:37,328
then the children should not have
set off any poltergeisting events.

318
00:18:38,029 --> 00:18:41,714
But there seems to be an upgraded crystal at work here.

319
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:45,423
He has turned these children into runaway Espers.

320
00:18:45,859 --> 00:18:48,029
Even as they lie here, in a deep sleep.

321
00:18:48,298 --> 00:18:51,671
So... if you did try to wake
them up, the poltergeisting...

322
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:52,346
Yes.

323
00:18:53,169 --> 00:18:55,117
The force would be incalculable.

324
00:18:56,749 --> 00:18:57,445
What now?

325
00:18:57,826 --> 00:18:59,177
We have to do something.

326
00:18:59,606 --> 00:19:04,221
I am developing a program that will
bring their abilities under control, but...

327
00:19:05,292 --> 00:19:09,077
The building block of Kihara's ability
crystal is known as the First Sample...

328
00:19:09,392 --> 00:19:14,295
It is a refined extraction that is derived from
the very first human subject of the experiment.

329
00:19:15,193 --> 00:19:17,401
If I'm going to complete the vaccine software,

330
00:19:17,426 --> 00:19:20,383
I have to analyze the data contained within that sample.

331
00:19:20,882 --> 00:19:23,520
So then that's why you were back at that laboratory.

332
00:19:24,016 --> 00:19:25,998
Yes, I was looking for that data.

333
00:19:26,558 --> 00:19:28,421
Unfortunately, I didn't find anything.

334
00:19:30,172 --> 00:19:31,648
But I'm not about to give up.

335
00:19:33,429 --> 00:19:37,393
That data is indispensable to the
continued research of ability crystals.

336
00:19:37,757 --> 00:19:40,293
There's no way something like that would be discarded.

337
00:19:41,616 --> 00:19:43,253
It must be out there somewhere...

338
00:19:43,826 --> 00:19:44,835
and I swear,

339
00:19:45,419 --> 00:19:47,528
I'll do whatever it takes to find it!

340
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:50,042
I see.

341
00:19:50,633 --> 00:19:51,764
And what if you can't?

342
00:19:54,851 --> 00:19:56,810
Then I will still wake up the children.

343
00:19:57,951 --> 00:19:59,940
Even knowing the kind of damage it'll cause?!

344
00:20:00,037 --> 00:20:02,674
I will not allow them to remain like this forever!

345
00:20:02,786 --> 00:20:05,827
I understand... but... you can't.

346
00:20:06,394 --> 00:20:07,136
She's right.

347
00:20:07,859 --> 00:20:09,289
Because I won't let you.

348
00:20:10,938 --> 00:20:11,922
Therestina?

349
00:20:12,581 --> 00:20:13,462
Hello, there.

350
00:20:13,786 --> 00:20:15,067
Sorry, but I followed you.

351
00:20:16,251 --> 00:20:16,807
What the...

352
00:20:17,169 --> 00:20:19,085
We're the Multi Active Rescue Team.

353
00:20:19,288 --> 00:20:21,204
These children are in our custody.

354
00:20:21,336 --> 00:20:23,266
It's best if you do as we instruct.

355
00:20:24,247 --> 00:20:25,943
Do I have a choice in the matter?

356
00:20:25,968 --> 00:20:31,281
No. It's our duty to seek out and prevent
any situation that might endanger Academy City.

357
00:20:31,498 --> 00:20:33,323
Naturally, I have a warrant with me.

358
00:20:33,586 --> 00:20:34,667
Feel free to read it...

359
00:20:34,837 --> 00:20:37,875
though, I had hoped you would
cooperate and make the process easier.

360
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:39,760
This looks to be in order.

361
00:20:40,913 --> 00:20:42,047
Please, don't worry.

362
00:20:42,294 --> 00:20:43,891
This kind of thing is our specialty.

363
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:47,768
We have a facility ready to offer the
children whatever treatment they need.

364
00:20:49,627 --> 00:20:50,564
But, please...

365
00:20:50,589 --> 00:20:52,892
And our data access exceeds yours.

366
00:20:53,044 --> 00:20:55,886
We can find information you could never lawfully obtain.

367
00:20:56,738 --> 00:20:59,669
Earlier, you mentioned something called the First Sample.

368
00:20:59,956 --> 00:21:02,790
It's possible that we can
acquire data on that item as well.

369
00:21:11,569 --> 00:21:12,383
Secure them.

370
00:21:16,748 --> 00:21:17,658
Hold on!

371
00:21:23,461 --> 00:21:24,330
What are you doing?

372
00:21:25,513 --> 00:21:29,136
You told me that if I didn't like what you
were doing, I'd have to come and stop you.

373
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:33,285
Move, now! I'm the only one who
can possibly save those children!

374
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:34,779
But you haven't, have you?!

375
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:37,193
First it was the Level Upper...

376
00:21:37,752 --> 00:21:41,127
now these poltergeist attacks... and still...

377
00:21:41,329 --> 00:21:42,880
You haven't saved one of them.

378
00:21:44,549 --> 00:21:46,035
I'm so close, though.

379
00:21:46,575 --> 00:21:48,109
I'm just one step away.

380
00:21:48,578 --> 00:21:49,443
I have to.

381
00:21:50,228 --> 00:21:51,413
You know Edasaki?

382
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:54,370
Well, she's asking for help, even now.

383
00:21:55,185 --> 00:21:56,324
I met this girl.

384
00:21:57,345 --> 00:21:58,604
Her name is Haru'ue.

385
00:21:59,384 --> 00:22:00,828
She's Edasaki's friend.

386
00:22:01,188 --> 00:22:02,616
She can hear her voice.

387
00:22:11,849 --> 00:22:12,690
Carry them out.

388
00:23:31,565 --> 00:23:34,248
I'm nervous. It's been a while since I've done a preview.

389
00:23:34,382 --> 00:23:36,549
I'll feel more comfortable if
I just remove some clothing...

390
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:38,079
For the millionth time: No!

391
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:40,095
Things are getting serious, so behave!
