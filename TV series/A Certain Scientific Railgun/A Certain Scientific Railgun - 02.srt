1
00:00:35,553 --> 00:00:36,549
You're not getting away now.

2
00:00:36,632 --> 00:00:38,591
Hey, hold on just a second. I'm only...

3
00:00:38,674 --> 00:00:40,174
You might as well give up!

4
00:00:48,985 --> 00:00:50,110
Hey, Misaka!

5
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,194
Oh, Uiharu. Saten. Hi, guys.

6
00:00:53,447 --> 00:00:55,122
What's up? Did something just happen?

7
00:00:55,402 --> 00:00:57,319
We heard a loud noise from this direction.

8
00:00:57,402 --> 00:00:57,915
Eh?

9
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:00,152
No, it was nothing.

10
00:02:39,152 --> 00:02:41,110
Today is a very important day.

11
00:02:41,303 --> 00:02:43,208
It's me and Sissy's anniversary.

12
00:02:43,707 --> 00:02:45,569
It happened exactly one month ago.

13
00:02:45,652 --> 00:02:47,821
Fate bound us together as roommates.

14
00:02:49,777 --> 00:02:51,360
I ordered something special.

15
00:02:51,447 --> 00:02:53,526
Unfortunately it hasn't arrived yet.

16
00:02:54,985 --> 00:02:57,028
But I still have one thing to offer.

17
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,174
Me.

18
00:02:59,965 --> 00:03:04,157
A heartfelt anniversary present
gift, wrapped in nothing other than...

19
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:07,694
My birthday suit!

20
00:03:07,777 --> 00:03:08,735
Kuroko!

21
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,306
Sissy! You're home at last!

22
00:03:10,944 --> 00:03:11,394
We're here.

23
00:03:11,419 --> 00:03:12,194
Also!

24
00:03:17,252 --> 00:03:18,444
I can't believe I'm in her room.

25
00:03:18,518 --> 00:03:19,726
This is too amazing!

26
00:03:19,819 --> 00:03:21,235
It's so stylish.

27
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:22,592
Talk about chic!

28
00:03:25,195 --> 00:03:27,742
Come and feel this. The bed's so soft and fluffy.

29
00:03:28,147 --> 00:03:29,740
It's very comfortable!

30
00:03:30,444 --> 00:03:33,060
Seriously, opening the door
like that? What were you thinking?

31
00:03:33,236 --> 00:03:37,069
I didn't expect company. Why did
you bring Uiharu and Saten along?

32
00:03:37,094 --> 00:03:39,131
I happened to run into them out on the street.

33
00:03:39,369 --> 00:03:41,705
They tagged along with me while I did some shopping.

34
00:03:41,845 --> 00:03:44,419
Then they said they wanted to see my dorm, so here we are.

35
00:03:44,444 --> 00:03:45,136
Shopping?

36
00:03:45,338 --> 00:03:45,833
Huh?

37
00:03:47,758 --> 00:03:48,787
Just for a little.

38
00:03:49,485 --> 00:03:50,363
It's official!

39
00:03:50,495 --> 00:03:53,017
The girls' dorms at Tokiwadai are amazing!

40
00:03:53,136 --> 00:03:54,961
I'm green with envy!

41
00:03:55,147 --> 00:03:58,194
And don't forget the dining
room. It was absolutely gigantic!

42
00:03:58,277 --> 00:03:59,860
It's not all that wonderful.

43
00:03:59,885 --> 00:04:02,609
Sissy, why did you choose today of all days?

44
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:05,127
My perfect anniversary plans are ruined!

45
00:04:05,697 --> 00:04:06,988
Oh! But what if...

46
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,902
I wanted you to witness this special day.

47
00:04:10,985 --> 00:04:14,717
Exactly one month ago, fate bound
Kuroko and me together as roommates.

48
00:04:14,902 --> 00:04:17,319
We may be two people, but we share a single heart.

49
00:04:17,402 --> 00:04:21,575
And so Uiharu, Saten, I truly hope we
have your blessing on our anniversary.

50
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:24,985
Here's looking at you, kid. Shall we drink?

51
00:04:28,809 --> 00:04:30,434
Um, excuse me, Shirai.

52
00:04:30,652 --> 00:04:32,003
But are you all right?

53
00:04:32,655 --> 00:04:34,498
Oh yes, I'm very well, thank you.

54
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:39,044
I'm afraid we don't have much to offer by way
of hospitality, but please make yourselves...

55
00:04:39,632 --> 00:04:41,705
Hey, Saten. What are you doing down there?

56
00:04:42,028 --> 00:04:47,313
Well, when you visit a friend's home, it's natural
to do some good-natured snooping, don't you think?

57
00:04:48,473 --> 00:04:49,557
Hot stuff!

58
00:04:49,582 --> 00:04:52,890
Stop that, Saten! You can't just
go through other people's things!

59
00:04:53,007 --> 00:04:55,110
Just what I'd expect from you, Misaka!

60
00:04:55,988 --> 00:04:58,118
Well, as a matter of fact...

61
00:04:58,143 --> 00:04:59,796
Those actually belong to me.

62
00:05:01,403 --> 00:05:02,867
Those are your panties, Shirai?

63
00:05:02,892 --> 00:05:04,586
These make a very bold statement.

64
00:05:04,894 --> 00:05:06,946
I would hardly consider those to be bold.

65
00:05:07,027 --> 00:05:08,446
They're a simple necessity.

66
00:05:08,596 --> 00:05:10,702
Every lady should have a pair of black panties.

67
00:05:11,528 --> 00:05:12,927
Well, what about this pair, then?

68
00:05:13,481 --> 00:05:16,956
Those really lift the spirit. I
wear them when I need some cheering up.

69
00:05:17,186 --> 00:05:19,268
And what about this barely-there thong?

70
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:22,715
Handy for avoiding lines when
one's clothes fit very tightly.

71
00:05:22,818 --> 00:05:25,868
A... And this black mesh, full-body stocking type thing?

72
00:05:25,893 --> 00:05:30,450
That's absolutely essential. It brings out the
supple feline that hides in the heart of every woman.

73
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:36,309
Couldn't you have at least given me a little warning?

74
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,944
Sorry, I was feeling overwhelmed. I
needed something to calm me down a little.

75
00:05:39,985 --> 00:05:43,152
And seeing your ordinary-striped
panties helps me to relax.

76
00:05:44,292 --> 00:05:47,003
I don't see what the big deal is. It's all just underwear.

77
00:05:47,409 --> 00:05:50,253
And there are other kinds that
you haven't even gotten to yet.

78
00:05:50,324 --> 00:05:53,875
A pearl-white babydoll with
an open bra and feminine frills.

79
00:05:53,961 --> 00:05:56,426
A lace teddy with sexy garter belts.

80
00:05:57,055 --> 00:05:58,252
And also these.

81
00:05:59,386 --> 00:06:00,466
That's good to know.

82
00:06:00,907 --> 00:06:03,139
At least she wears regular underwear, too.

83
00:06:03,164 --> 00:06:04,402
It's very comforting.

84
00:06:04,485 --> 00:06:06,239
I was beginning to think I didn't know her.

85
00:06:08,282 --> 00:06:08,956
Sorry.

86
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:10,520
These are actually mine.

87
00:06:11,542 --> 00:06:13,084
As for you, Kuroko!

88
00:06:13,152 --> 00:06:16,652
Explain yourself! What is my
underwear doing under your bed, huh?

89
00:06:16,735 --> 00:06:18,360
You've got it all wrong, Sissy!

90
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:20,569
Oh, you know what would be awesome, Misaka?

91
00:06:20,652 --> 00:06:23,277
I'd love to see some old photo albums if you have any!

92
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:24,902
Great idea! So would I!

93
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:27,886
Maybe some pictures from when
you and Shirai were in grade school?

94
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:29,544
That would be so interesting to see!

95
00:06:32,235 --> 00:06:34,902
Wow! How adorable!

96
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:37,160
Is that from your first day of elementary school?

97
00:06:37,185 --> 00:06:39,584
That pretty woman next to you. Is she your mother?

98
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:40,806
Uh, yeah.

99
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:42,919
What a cute kimono!

100
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:44,319
You were such a darling little kid!

101
00:06:44,402 --> 00:06:46,277
You know, I'm a little surprised.

102
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,204
About what?

103
00:06:47,366 --> 00:06:50,044
It's just-you're this powerful Level 5, Misaka.

104
00:06:50,069 --> 00:06:52,280
The Ace of Tokiwadai, an electromaster.

105
00:06:52,325 --> 00:06:56,360
I guess I kinda expected you to be one of those
kids who get taken away while they are really young

106
00:06:56,385 --> 00:06:58,218
and immediately fast-tracked for success.

107
00:06:58,243 --> 00:06:59,693
It wasn't like that at all.

108
00:07:00,106 --> 00:07:02,908
I wasn't always like this. I started out as a Level 1.

109
00:07:03,134 --> 00:07:04,791
I was just an ordinary girl.

110
00:07:06,723 --> 00:07:07,429
Wow.

111
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:10,681
Cool, let's look at Shirai's photos next.

112
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:12,291
I'd be glad to show you them.

113
00:07:12,356 --> 00:07:14,669
At least, I would be if I had something to show.

114
00:07:14,694 --> 00:07:17,824
Unfortunately, I don't have any
photo albums for your viewing pleasure.

115
00:07:18,777 --> 00:07:21,175
I am a girl who believes in seizing the day.

116
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:25,107
I don't like to dwell in the past
nor do I worry about the future.

117
00:07:25,306 --> 00:07:28,790
No, not me. I stay in the present and savor each moment.

118
00:07:29,027 --> 00:07:30,881
That's the philosophy I live my life by.

119
00:07:30,906 --> 00:07:31,641
What about this?

120
00:07:32,694 --> 00:07:34,236
No, you can't look at that!

121
00:07:41,915 --> 00:07:46,113
Kuroko, you...! It's a good thing that you
like to live in the present moment so much,

122
00:07:46,138 --> 00:07:49,022
because right now I'm thinking you're
not going to have a very enjoyable future!

123
00:07:49,047 --> 00:07:50,197
You've got it all wrong!

124
00:07:50,628 --> 00:07:53,709
Don't you understand I only made
it because you mean so much to me?

125
00:07:54,363 --> 00:07:57,969
Do you not even remember what an
important day it is today, Sissy?

126
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:02,537
And here I thought you brought Uiharu
and Saten so they could celebrate with us!

127
00:08:03,579 --> 00:08:04,055
What?

128
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:06,740
Celebrating with Uiharu and Saten?

129
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,730
Oh, I see what you're saying.

130
00:08:08,755 --> 00:08:10,854
Then you do remember what today is, Sissy?

131
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,439
Of course! How silly of me.

132
00:08:12,464 --> 00:08:16,027
Today is the one-week anniversary of the
day you introduced me to Saten and Uiharu!

133
00:08:19,537 --> 00:08:20,755
It's unbelievable!

134
00:08:21,069 --> 00:08:23,312
The last seven days have gone by so quickly!

135
00:08:23,344 --> 00:08:25,473
It seems really crazy that it's only been a week!

136
00:08:25,606 --> 00:08:28,027
It feels like we've known each
other so much longer than that.

137
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,175
Don't you guys agree?

138
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,241
I'm really glad I met you two, though.

139
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:34,022
Why does she treat me so much
differently from those other two?

140
00:08:34,654 --> 00:08:37,009
I'm starting to feel like I'm a third wheel here.

141
00:08:37,312 --> 00:08:39,187
We've already been through a lot together.

142
00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:40,575
Like this little bean.

143
00:08:41,027 --> 00:08:46,360
It's been cast aside and neglected by its fellow
beans and now it is but a sad solitary legume.

144
00:08:46,652 --> 00:08:48,569
You know, this is better than I expected.

145
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:49,117
Yeah?

146
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:51,023
That's the liquid sandwich?

147
00:08:52,067 --> 00:08:54,140
Anyway, like I was saying, Uiharu...

148
00:08:54,165 --> 00:08:55,623
Please, Saten, don't finish that thought!

149
00:08:57,944 --> 00:08:59,515
You guys're hysterical!

150
00:09:00,696 --> 00:09:03,115
Pipe down, would you? What's with all the slurping?

151
00:09:04,152 --> 00:09:05,969
Red beans have feelings too, you know.

152
00:09:06,273 --> 00:09:06,750
Huh?

153
00:09:07,011 --> 00:09:10,162
Can't you see how I might be
feeling a little abandoned, here?

154
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:11,485
Well, uh...

155
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:12,801
One week since you met them?

156
00:09:13,062 --> 00:09:15,303
Don't make me laugh. One week is nothing.

157
00:09:15,497 --> 00:09:16,239
One month.

158
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,417
That's how long it's been for us, Sissy.

159
00:09:18,612 --> 00:09:22,731
Today is the one... month anniversary of when
fate decreed that we would be bound together!

160
00:09:24,152 --> 00:09:25,520
One whole month, Sissy.

161
00:09:25,545 --> 00:09:30,112
Exactly one month ago, by some random
chance, you and I became roommates.

162
00:09:30,852 --> 00:09:35,833
Since then, we've eaten together and slept
together. Shared each others' joys and sorrows.

163
00:09:36,235 --> 00:09:38,444
All right here! In this very room!

164
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,900
But you, you don't remember, do you?

165
00:09:46,418 --> 00:09:47,668
She seems upset.

166
00:09:47,902 --> 00:09:51,197
It does seem serious. Maybe we
should go and leave them to talk.

167
00:09:51,422 --> 00:09:54,098
Kuroko, stop that.

168
00:09:54,765 --> 00:09:55,270
What is it, Sissy?

169
00:09:55,295 --> 00:09:58,122
You know full well that you manipulated your way in here.

170
00:09:58,245 --> 00:10:01,374
It wasn't fate or random chance or anything of the sort,

171
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:03,069
and now you talk about joys
and sorrows and lonely red beans?

172
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:06,235
You know, I think I just remembered
something urgent that I need to attend to.

173
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,784
How dare you make this all
sound like some kind of fairy tale!

174
00:10:08,985 --> 00:10:11,210
I was just altering the story slightly, that's all.

175
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:13,777
And in return, I'm going to alter your face for you!

176
00:10:15,173 --> 00:10:16,990
Maybe I see things different than you.

177
00:10:17,335 --> 00:10:19,254
It's not like I'm asking very much.

178
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:23,132
I just wanted to celebrate today
with you in one small way, Sissy.

179
00:10:24,052 --> 00:10:24,663
Yes?

180
00:10:25,044 --> 00:10:28,169
I have a delivery. It's addressed to a Miss Kuroko Shirai.

181
00:10:28,238 --> 00:10:29,520
Is this room 208?

182
00:10:31,147 --> 00:10:33,627
Yes. Can you tell me what the delivery is?

183
00:10:33,652 --> 00:10:35,241
It just says "computer parts."

184
00:10:35,937 --> 00:10:37,377
I shouldn't have been so worried.

185
00:10:37,481 --> 00:10:40,261
These people know their business
well enough to be discreet.

186
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:42,382
What's the name of the sender?

187
00:10:42,505 --> 00:10:45,596
Ehh, Love and Herbs: Premiere Aphrodisiacs, Ltd.

188
00:10:45,705 --> 00:10:47,942
Way to throw discretion right out the window!

189
00:10:48,289 --> 00:10:53,846
Kuroko, why does this small celebration you
have planned involve the use of aphrodisiacs?

190
00:10:53,871 --> 00:10:54,380
Well, uh...

191
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,752
I've been too lenient.

192
00:10:55,777 --> 00:10:59,677
It looks like you're going to need some harsher
punishment before you learn to behave yourself.

193
00:11:00,122 --> 00:11:03,654
Now I'm going to fry you until
your appearance matches your name!

194
00:11:08,205 --> 00:11:11,992
Did you forget that I can just
teleport away from you whenever I want to?

195
00:11:12,319 --> 00:11:15,152
If this is how you truly feel, you leave me no choice.

196
00:11:15,235 --> 00:11:17,299
You will not return the love I freely offer.

197
00:11:17,352 --> 00:11:19,871
So I'll make sure nobody else can have your love, either.

198
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:25,187
Is something wrong, Sissy?

199
00:11:25,444 --> 00:11:27,305
Dormitory Rules, Part 9.

200
00:11:27,527 --> 00:11:31,658
The use of Esper abilities inside
the dormitories is strictly prohibited.

201
00:11:32,027 --> 00:11:34,256
Surely you haven't forgotten that, Shirai. Hm?

202
00:11:35,114 --> 00:11:38,989
Good afternoon, Head Resident, and
might I say you look quite stunning today.

203
00:11:39,189 --> 00:11:41,350
Naturally, we haven't forgotten the rules.

204
00:11:41,408 --> 00:11:43,366
We weren't just casually using our powers.

205
00:11:43,446 --> 00:11:46,679
I assure you, we had a good
reason. Yes, a very good reason.

206
00:11:47,046 --> 00:11:48,134
Is that so?

207
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:50,635
There weren't unavoidable circumstances, were there?

208
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:52,915
Yes, that's it exactly. You see, we...

209
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:53,709
Too bad.

210
00:11:56,889 --> 00:11:57,873
Kuroko!

211
00:12:00,522 --> 00:12:06,004
If I made allowances for every so-called emergency
situation, the dorm would fall into utter chaos.

212
00:12:06,544 --> 00:12:09,450
Rule breakers must be punished, without exception.

213
00:12:10,655 --> 00:12:12,780
That's how order is maintained.

214
00:12:12,944 --> 00:12:13,898
Don't you think?

215
00:12:14,569 --> 00:12:17,291
Y... Yes.

216
00:12:19,777 --> 00:12:21,121
Give me a break!

217
00:12:21,488 --> 00:12:23,696
Why should I be stuck doing this, too?

218
00:12:23,929 --> 00:12:26,385
So I got a little carried away. It was no big deal.

219
00:12:26,485 --> 00:12:28,279
This punishment is unreasonable!

220
00:12:28,843 --> 00:12:30,811
Making me clean this whole pool by hand?

221
00:12:31,105 --> 00:12:33,813
That's cruel and unusual by anyone's standards!

222
00:12:35,694 --> 00:12:36,366
Ahhh!

223
00:12:37,233 --> 00:12:40,061
We started in the morning and it's already past noon now.

224
00:12:40,152 --> 00:12:43,071
How is it we're not even a third
of the way done with this yet?

225
00:12:43,455 --> 00:12:45,610
I don't think we're going to finish it all today.

226
00:12:52,812 --> 00:12:54,733
I totally lucked out!

227
00:12:54,806 --> 00:13:00,454
Here with Sissy at the pool, spending quality
time alone together, working up a good sweat.

228
00:13:01,267 --> 00:13:05,486
This is the perfect opportunity to get
some payback for yesterday's humiliation.

229
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,052
You know, Sissy...

230
00:13:08,911 --> 00:13:13,089
When working under a hot sun, rehydration
is essential to one's health, don't you think?

231
00:13:13,214 --> 00:13:15,673
Would you like some of this specially formulated beverage?

232
00:13:15,947 --> 00:13:17,073
Thanks. I'll pass.

233
00:13:18,235 --> 00:13:19,895
Why not? Aren't you thirsty?

234
00:13:21,198 --> 00:13:22,252
Well, tell me this.

235
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:26,960
Those computer parts that you ordered, they didn't
happen to find their way into that drink, did they?

236
00:13:28,945 --> 00:13:30,154
That's what I thought.

237
00:13:30,763 --> 00:13:31,529
Shirai?

238
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:34,527
Yep. That's Shirai, all right.

239
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:37,152
We thought that was you, but
what are you doing down there?

240
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:39,946
What does it look like I'm
doing? I'm scrubbing out the pool.

241
00:13:39,971 --> 00:13:41,422
We see that. But why?

242
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:44,496
Because we live in a cold, cold
world, even during the summer.

243
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:46,533
What are you two doing here?

244
00:13:47,095 --> 00:13:49,057
We're members of the swim club, so
it's our job to check on the tank filters.

245
00:13:49,082 --> 00:13:51,066
They must be Kuroko's classmates.

246
00:13:51,277 --> 00:13:52,360
And that means...

247
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:57,777
They're actually younger than me.

248
00:13:57,987 --> 00:13:58,834
Hey, Sissy.

249
00:13:59,485 --> 00:14:01,434
I want you to meet some classmates of mine.

250
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,298
That's Kinuho Wannai on the right

251
00:14:03,477 --> 00:14:05,164
and the other's Ma'aya Awatsuki.

252
00:14:06,485 --> 00:14:07,770
Hey, nice to meet you.

253
00:14:07,908 --> 00:14:08,870
And this august personage...

254
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:12,058
Excuse me. I think I recognize you. Are you Misaka?

255
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:12,939
Huh?

256
00:14:13,444 --> 00:14:14,513
Oh, yeah. That's me.

257
00:14:15,215 --> 00:14:16,133
I knew it!

258
00:14:17,114 --> 00:14:18,524
Do you remember me at all?

259
00:14:19,038 --> 00:14:20,772
You came to my rescue a while back.

260
00:14:21,035 --> 00:14:24,302
Some guys were giving me trouble, and
you dealt with them like they were nothing.

261
00:14:24,574 --> 00:14:25,644
It was amazing!

262
00:14:27,277 --> 00:14:29,235
Did I do that? It must have slipped my mind.

263
00:14:29,319 --> 00:14:32,319
Anyway, ever since then, I've
really wanted to say thank you.

264
00:14:32,508 --> 00:14:36,152
I've heard a lot of stories about
you. It's an honor to meet you in person.

265
00:14:36,177 --> 00:14:38,054
That sounds like my Sissy, all right.

266
00:14:38,103 --> 00:14:42,465
She goes around dealing with thugs like
that no matter how many times I tell her not to.

267
00:14:44,256 --> 00:14:45,069
No doubt.

268
00:14:45,268 --> 00:14:48,019
When it starts to get hot, the
weirdos come out of the woodwork.

269
00:14:48,044 --> 00:14:49,858
It sounds like you were incredible.

270
00:14:50,402 --> 00:14:53,386
Absolutely. You were so cool and collected the whole time.

271
00:14:53,411 --> 00:14:54,536
No, no, no. It wasn't a big deal, really.

272
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:55,499
Wait a sec...

273
00:14:57,027 --> 00:14:58,529
Oh, you guys are hysterical!

274
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:03,827
Déjà vu! No, it's just my imagination.

275
00:15:03,972 --> 00:15:06,097
The incident yesterday is making me paranoid.

276
00:15:06,444 --> 00:15:09,615
I'm not the odd-man-out here. That would be crazy! Right?

277
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,158
Hot as it is, it must be tough working out here.

278
00:15:13,319 --> 00:15:16,090
I should have a sports drink in my bag if you'd like some.

279
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:17,406
Here, you need it more than me.

280
00:15:17,431 --> 00:15:18,433
I'd love some.

281
00:15:18,569 --> 00:15:19,902
That's so nice of you.

282
00:15:23,451 --> 00:15:25,623
Why is she excluding me like this?

283
00:15:26,165 --> 00:15:27,062
Could it be?

284
00:15:27,485 --> 00:15:30,978
Now that I think about it, this isn't
the first time she's ignored me lately.

285
00:15:31,174 --> 00:15:35,364
I've tried over and over again to deepen
our friendship, but she keeps tossing me aside.

286
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:41,401
It's entirely possible that Sissy has
been deliberately giving me the cold shoulder.

287
00:15:42,319 --> 00:15:43,737
Suck it up, Kuroko.

288
00:15:43,902 --> 00:15:46,141
You've lost your confidence, and you need to get it back.

289
00:15:46,254 --> 00:15:48,569
Forget your anxiety and play to your strengths.

290
00:15:48,594 --> 00:15:49,469
That's it!

291
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:51,110
I'm a teleporter, after all!

292
00:15:51,135 --> 00:15:53,874
There are any number of ways
I can prove my worth to Sissy.

293
00:15:53,899 --> 00:15:55,453
I just have to find the right one.

294
00:15:57,601 --> 00:16:00,652
Wow, incredible! It's washing away all the grime.

295
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:04,117
My ability is manipulating water
currents, so it's a piece of cake.

296
00:16:04,246 --> 00:16:07,777
We need to finish up our inspection
right now, but after I've taken care of that,

297
00:16:07,814 --> 00:16:11,186
I would love to come back down here and
help you out, if you wouldn't mind the company.

298
00:16:11,277 --> 00:16:13,092
Huh? I don't know...

299
00:16:13,117 --> 00:16:16,200
It's the least I can do to repay
you for saving me from those guys.

300
00:16:16,903 --> 00:16:19,194
Well in that case, how could a girl say no?

301
00:16:19,219 --> 00:16:21,011
Excellent. I'm so glad you agreed!

302
00:16:21,152 --> 00:16:22,150
It's amazing!

303
00:16:22,257 --> 00:16:25,234
We'll be done in no time at this rate. Thank you so much!

304
00:16:26,468 --> 00:16:28,069
Okay, then. I'll see you in a bit!

305
00:16:28,184 --> 00:16:30,944
I'll leave the sports drink
here, too, so you can stay hydrated.

306
00:16:31,082 --> 00:16:32,281
Have as much as you want.

307
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:38,735
Wow. Those friends of yours are really nice, Kuroko.

308
00:16:38,818 --> 00:16:39,734
One could say so.

309
00:16:39,819 --> 00:16:43,319
I'm glad they came along. This will
take ten minutes doing it her way.

310
00:16:43,344 --> 00:16:44,302
One could say so.

311
00:16:44,444 --> 00:16:45,439
Ahhh!

312
00:16:45,705 --> 00:16:47,727
When we're done I wanna get some ice cream.

313
00:16:47,752 --> 00:16:48,747
One could say so.

314
00:16:51,569 --> 00:16:54,985
I've got a rip in one of my school uniforms.
What do you think I should do about it?

315
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:56,093
One could say "sew."

316
00:16:56,472 --> 00:16:58,993
Is there something wrong? You seem down or something.

317
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,226
I'm fine. Pay no attention to me.

318
00:17:02,743 --> 00:17:04,475
Don't trouble yourself on my account.

319
00:17:04,505 --> 00:17:06,808
I'm a useless teleporter who can't even clean pool.

320
00:17:07,771 --> 00:17:08,964
Um, Kuroko.

321
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:11,569
If there's something that you
need to get off your chest, then...

322
00:17:11,594 --> 00:17:12,878
Thanks, but no thanks!

323
00:17:13,635 --> 00:17:16,987
It's my own fault for not being
worthy of your affection, Sissy.

324
00:17:17,841 --> 00:17:19,567
I know I'm no help at all.

325
00:17:19,944 --> 00:17:21,741
I just annoy you all the time.

326
00:17:22,865 --> 00:17:24,823
I see why you've been acting this way.

327
00:17:24,985 --> 00:17:28,942
Someone like me could never hope to
deserve somebody as amazing as you!

328
00:17:40,509 --> 00:17:42,527
Great. What do I do?

329
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:45,152
I don't know how to handle sudden breakdowns like this.

330
00:17:45,777 --> 00:17:46,843
I'm curious.

331
00:17:47,128 --> 00:17:48,886
I wonder if Misaka's given it to her.

332
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,819
I don't know, but I sure wish
we could be there when she does.

333
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,273
It seems only fair since we
were with her when she bought it.

334
00:17:54,321 --> 00:17:56,742
I'm interested to find out how Shirai will react.

335
00:17:56,822 --> 00:17:59,044
I mean, given her taste in underwear and all.

336
00:17:59,173 --> 00:18:00,944
Yeah, that was crazy, huh?

337
00:18:00,977 --> 00:18:04,114
I never would have expected her
to own all that daring lingerie.

338
00:18:04,544 --> 00:18:07,365
But, you know, it's the thought that counts, ultimately.

339
00:18:08,944 --> 00:18:10,277
Yeah, that's true.

340
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,467
So, Kuroko.

341
00:18:16,813 --> 00:18:19,489
Do you remember what happened exactly a month ago today?

342
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,571
A month ago today?

343
00:18:23,596 --> 00:18:26,568
That's right. Don't you remember?
The night that you broke into my room?

344
00:18:26,945 --> 00:18:29,486
The Head Resident caught you, and you got a good scolding.

345
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:32,242
Then, the next day

346
00:18:33,289 --> 00:18:35,577
they made the two of us clean the whole dining hall.

347
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,838
And one thing led to another, and here we are.

348
00:19:03,096 --> 00:19:04,658
Still together a month later.

349
00:19:05,347 --> 00:19:07,636
So, if we were going to have an anniversary

350
00:19:08,157 --> 00:19:09,574
then it would be today, wouldn't it?

351
00:19:22,277 --> 00:19:23,694
May I open it now?

352
00:19:23,777 --> 00:19:24,778
Yeah, of course.

353
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,350
I plan to be friends for a long time,

354
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:38,084
so don't quit on me now.

355
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:42,652
Do you mean it, Sissy? A long
time? Like, forever and ever, maybe?

356
00:19:42,735 --> 00:19:46,773
Well, of course I mean it. We go to the
same school, and we live in the same room.

357
00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:48,576
We couldn't split up even if we tried.

358
00:19:49,197 --> 00:19:50,824
After all, we're partners, right?

359
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:52,839
Here.

360
00:19:55,136 --> 00:19:57,761
Here's to being partners. Shall we drink?

361
00:19:59,314 --> 00:20:01,564
Here's to being forever bound together by fate!

362
00:20:01,589 --> 00:20:03,984
Here's to remaining roommates and good friends!

363
00:20:11,493 --> 00:20:13,716
All right, then. What do you say we get back to work?

364
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:21,930
Right. Back to work.

365
00:20:26,606 --> 00:20:28,136
You know something, Sissy?

366
00:20:29,257 --> 00:20:32,388
I think it would be better to wear
a swimsuit while you clean the pool.

367
00:20:32,413 --> 00:20:34,745
That way it wouldn't matter if you got wet, you know?

368
00:20:35,436 --> 00:20:39,329
Yeah, but it would be too much
of a pain to go back and get it.

369
00:20:40,652 --> 00:20:43,277
Actually, I thought something like this might happen.

370
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,159
Ta... da!

371
00:20:44,652 --> 00:20:48,157
I brought your school swimsuit with
me in case of just such an emergency.

372
00:20:49,306 --> 00:20:52,431
The last time I checked, that swimsuit was in my locker!

373
00:20:52,547 --> 00:20:57,197
You should know locks don't mean very much
to somebody who has my particular abilities.

374
00:20:57,658 --> 00:21:00,360
Now, why don't you go ahead and put it on, Sissy?

375
00:21:10,021 --> 00:21:13,098
How sad. I don't think I've seen
such childish underwear before.

376
00:21:13,123 --> 00:21:14,825
That's enough! Give them back!

377
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:18,935
Like I said, put on your swimsu...
Wait a sec... Oh, my goodness!

378
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,048
This is a bunny, and this is a bunny, too!

379
00:21:22,263 --> 00:21:24,813
We match! Me and Sissy match!

380
00:21:25,302 --> 00:21:26,560
Kuroko!

381
00:21:27,585 --> 00:21:29,685
It sounds so lively. What's going on?

382
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:33,909
Misaka, we're all finished up with our inspection,
so we came back to help out like we promised.

383
00:21:34,775 --> 00:21:37,970
Oh, yes. Hit me again with your electrified whip of love!

384
00:21:39,449 --> 00:21:40,402
Give them back!

385
00:21:40,607 --> 00:21:42,002
Give them back now!

386
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:42,671
I can't do that.

387
00:21:42,696 --> 00:21:43,502
I'm dead serious.

388
00:21:43,527 --> 00:21:44,819
If I give them back, you'll stop.

389
00:21:44,844 --> 00:21:46,261
Stop saying that!

390
00:21:48,694 --> 00:21:50,569
Let's pretend we didn't see anything.

391
00:21:50,594 --> 00:21:52,230
Yeah. That's a good idea.

392
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:56,294
I'll never get disheartened
again. Nothing can take her from me.

393
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:58,152
We'll be together forever!

394
00:23:30,819 --> 00:23:32,761
He loves me, he loves me not,

395
00:23:33,027 --> 00:23:33,880
he loves me, he loves me not...

396
00:23:33,936 --> 00:23:35,110
Um, excuse me.

397
00:23:35,194 --> 00:23:36,652
Please stop doing that, Saten.

398
00:23:36,735 --> 00:23:38,968
That's not what the flowers on my head are intended for.
