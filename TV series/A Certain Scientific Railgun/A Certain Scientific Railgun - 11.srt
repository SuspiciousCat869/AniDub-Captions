1
00:00:06,921 --> 00:00:08,698
Computational device?

2
00:00:09,171 --> 00:00:13,373
By using the AIM diffusion field as a
medium, I was able to construct a network...

3
00:00:13,721 --> 00:00:18,734
And by distributing the processing across
multiple brains, I can enable complex computations.

4
00:00:19,069 --> 00:00:20,892
That's what the Level Upper really is.

5
00:00:23,539 --> 00:00:24,264
But why?

6
00:00:24,772 --> 00:00:26,897
I requested the use of Tree Diagram...

7
00:00:27,099 --> 00:00:29,983
I needed access to it to perform certain simulations.

8
00:00:30,355 --> 00:00:32,226
But for whatever reason, I was denied.

9
00:00:32,734 --> 00:00:35,270
I needed a computational device in its place.

10
00:00:36,754 --> 00:00:39,034
You've used their brains to construct a computer?

11
00:00:39,422 --> 00:00:41,672
I've put about ten thousand of them together.

12
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:43,656
That should be an adequate substitute.

13
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:47,797
Don't give me such a reproachful look.

14
00:00:49,272 --> 00:00:50,990
It will all be over soon enough.

15
00:00:51,713 --> 00:00:53,994
And once it is, everyone will be released.

16
00:00:56,437 --> 00:00:58,014
This is a treatment program...

17
00:00:58,051 --> 00:00:59,841
It will uninstall the Level Upper.

18
00:01:00,976 --> 00:01:02,254
I'm giving it to you.

19
00:01:05,546 --> 00:01:07,338
There are no lasting aftereffects.

20
00:01:07,363 --> 00:01:10,939
Everything will return to normal,
and nobody will be lost in the process.

21
00:01:11,068 --> 00:01:12,679
And I'm supposed to trust you?

22
00:01:12,794 --> 00:01:15,756
You give me this thing that probably
hasn't even been tested before,

23
00:01:15,781 --> 00:01:18,170
and I should just take it without asking questions?

24
00:01:18,825 --> 00:01:20,448
You have quite a harsh view of me.

25
00:01:23,634 --> 00:01:26,645
Yes. Dr. Kiyama is not at this location.

26
00:01:28,148 --> 00:01:30,264
Copy that. We are seizing all data.

27
00:01:36,516 --> 00:01:37,466
What is all this?

28
00:01:38,938 --> 00:01:39,873
That's not good.

29
00:01:41,164 --> 00:01:42,846
It looks like they've already arrived.

30
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:48,263
It hasn't been long enough since they lost contact with
you for that to be the reason they're making this move.

31
00:01:48,382 --> 00:01:50,382
They must have figured it out some other way.

32
00:01:51,452 --> 00:01:54,235
I programmed my equipment with
security measures in the event

33
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:56,991
it was booted without following designated protocols.

34
00:01:58,172 --> 00:02:02,112
Those measures have been activated, which
means all data on the Level Upper has been lost.

35
00:02:02,626 --> 00:02:06,671
The only means of waking the sleepers now
is what you're holding there in your hand.

36
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,818
So take good care of it.

37
00:02:25,567 --> 00:02:27,344
Attention, Harumi Kiyama!

38
00:02:27,978 --> 00:02:29,625
Antiskill is here, huh?

39
00:02:30,064 --> 00:02:34,463
One thing that I can say for them is that they
sure move fast when their orders come from the top.

40
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:38,111
You are under arrest for suspicion
of distributing the Level Upper...

41
00:02:38,399 --> 00:02:40,021
Surrender yourself at once.

42
00:02:40,105 --> 00:02:41,208
What are you gonna do...?

43
00:02:41,403 --> 00:02:43,576
It looks like this is the end of the line for you.

44
00:02:45,084 --> 00:02:46,751
The Level Upper is a program...

45
00:02:46,881 --> 00:02:50,918
It was designed for making computing equipment
through the use of human brain activity...

46
00:02:51,688 --> 00:02:52,711
but that isn't all.

47
00:02:53,157 --> 00:02:56,480
It also generates a certain byproduct within its users.

48
00:02:57,994 --> 00:03:00,562
I've got an interesting demonstration for you.

49
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:40,981
I want you to slowly place both hands
behind your head and lie down on your stomach.

50
00:04:43,061 --> 00:04:44,995
The girl hostage appears unharmed.

51
00:04:46,171 --> 00:04:47,242
Secure her!

52
00:04:58,361 --> 00:04:59,067
What was that?!

53
00:04:59,211 --> 00:05:01,145
I... I can't control myself!

54
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:07,557
Impossible! She's an Esper?!

55
00:05:11,641 --> 00:05:14,104
Keep the change... and please, get out of here quickly.

56
00:05:14,129 --> 00:05:15,111
Why? What's happening?

57
00:05:16,224 --> 00:05:17,840
Kuroko, tell me what's going on!

58
00:05:17,865 --> 00:05:18,515
Kuroko!

59
00:05:19,474 --> 00:05:22,775
Antiskill managed to locate
Kiyama, but she's engaging them...

60
00:05:23,224 --> 00:05:25,619
What's more... She's using an ability.

61
00:05:26,271 --> 00:05:28,265
What are you saying? Is she an Esper?

62
00:05:28,727 --> 00:05:32,571
The databank doesn't show any record
of her receiving any ability development.

63
00:05:32,793 --> 00:05:33,666
Even so...

64
00:05:39,008 --> 00:05:41,350
She is clearly using some kind of ability.

65
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:44,754
And what's more, it looks like there
have to be multiple abilities in play.

66
00:05:44,782 --> 00:05:45,720
No way!

67
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,177
No one ever has more than one ability.

68
00:05:50,469 --> 00:05:52,148
There are no exceptions, are there?

69
00:05:53,081 --> 00:05:55,260
Maybe it has something to do with the Level Upper.

70
00:05:56,288 --> 00:06:01,542
In her system, she has ten thousand Espers synaptically
linked by some kind of bizarre computer network...

71
00:06:02,043 --> 00:06:04,058
They can be thought of as one giant brain.

72
00:06:04,772 --> 00:06:09,483
If she can really control them, she should be
able to do things that no normal brain could do alone.

73
00:06:10,149 --> 00:06:13,686
If my guess is correct, then
Kiyama's become something entirely new.

74
00:06:14,033 --> 00:06:17,339
The phantom being that nobody
thought could actually exist...

75
00:06:17,588 --> 00:06:19,096
A compound Esper...

76
00:06:19,525 --> 00:06:20,565
"Dual Skill."

77
00:06:26,954 --> 00:06:28,351
Antiskill's wiped out...

78
00:06:28,946 --> 00:06:29,756
All of them.

79
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:33,634
Uiharu!

80
00:06:36,147 --> 00:06:37,060
Are you all right?

81
00:06:37,354 --> 00:06:38,568
You can relax.

82
00:06:39,404 --> 00:06:42,366
She just caught an aftershock from
the fighting and got knocked out...

83
00:06:42,665 --> 00:06:44,106
Her life is in no danger.

84
00:06:45,421 --> 00:06:46,570
Mikoto Misaka...

85
00:06:47,426 --> 00:06:50,079
One of only seven Level 5s in Academy City...

86
00:06:51,546 --> 00:06:56,142
Despite your extensive skill and experience, I
doubt you have fought against an opponent like me.

87
00:06:56,722 --> 00:07:01,157
Do you think you'll be able to stop me when I
have the power of ten thousand minds at my disposal?

88
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:03,239
That's what you want to know?

89
00:07:03,453 --> 00:07:04,366
Can I stop you...?

90
00:07:05,325 --> 00:07:06,439
Of course I can!

91
00:07:15,508 --> 00:07:16,641
You're full of surprises.

92
00:07:16,883 --> 00:07:19,636
You really can use a lot of
different abilities, can't you?

93
00:07:19,725 --> 00:07:21,846
This "Dual Skill" thing's pretty fascinating.

94
00:07:21,871 --> 00:07:23,610
It should make for an interesting battle.

95
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:28,835
You'll find my ability is different in nature and
in name than the impossible power people speak of.

96
00:07:29,308 --> 00:07:31,963
It should be called... "Multiskill"!

97
00:07:33,296 --> 00:07:37,654
Call it whatever you want, for all I care... A
new name won't change what I'm going to do to you!

98
00:07:41,588 --> 00:07:42,581
Is something wrong?

99
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:47,925
You knew I could use multiple abilities, but
you didn't think I could use them all at once?

100
00:08:02,431 --> 00:08:03,563
Is she insane?

101
00:08:03,659 --> 00:08:06,957
She wields those abilities without any
concern of getting caught up in them?!

102
00:08:07,355 --> 00:08:08,966
That was anticlimactic.

103
00:08:09,326 --> 00:08:12,175
I would've thought a Level 5
would be capable of more than that.

104
00:08:14,363 --> 00:08:16,364
So you were able to counter one of my shocks.

105
00:08:16,756 --> 00:08:18,420
Don't think that means you've won!

106
00:08:21,464 --> 00:08:21,972
Huh?

107
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,578
Oh, crap!

108
00:08:31,554 --> 00:08:33,640
Why don't you stop this foolishness?

109
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:37,613
There's just one little matter
that I need to look into further...

110
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:40,274
and once that's done, I'll release all of them.

111
00:08:41,797 --> 00:08:43,438
I won't sacrifice anyone.

112
00:08:43,463 --> 00:08:44,590
Are you kidding me?!

113
00:08:45,362 --> 00:08:47,134
You won't sacrifice anyone?

114
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:49,562
What about all the people you've dragged into this?

115
00:08:50,849 --> 00:08:53,351
What about all the people whose lives you've toyed with?!

116
00:08:53,628 --> 00:08:56,458
After all you've done there's no
chance you're getting away with it!

117
00:08:58,272 --> 00:09:03,225
Good grief. You may be a Level 5 but still,
you have no idea how the world works, do you?

118
00:09:03,806 --> 00:09:05,671
Not the twisted world you live in!

119
00:09:07,248 --> 00:09:10,859
You undergo a special "ability
development" on a daily basis.

120
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:14,418
Do you really think everything they
do in this city is safe and humane?

121
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:21,492
The powers that be in Academy City are concealing
something very important about these abilities.

122
00:09:22,287 --> 00:09:24,662
The teachers who work here know nothing about it.

123
00:09:25,801 --> 00:09:29,183
But they're still "developing" the
brains of their young students every day.

124
00:09:31,287 --> 00:09:34,267
Can you begin to understand how dangerous that might be?

125
00:09:35,035 --> 00:09:37,922
I'll admit that's quite an
interesting story you just told.

126
00:09:38,985 --> 00:09:41,713
And I'll be sure to take a nice, long look into it.

127
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:43,945
Once I've taken you into custody!

128
00:09:46,988 --> 00:09:48,188
That will have to wait...

129
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,904
I've got other things to tend to at the moment.

130
00:09:54,629 --> 00:09:55,629
Empty cans...?

131
00:09:57,808 --> 00:09:58,721
Gravitons!

132
00:09:59,844 --> 00:10:01,018
So, what will you do now?

133
00:10:01,463 --> 00:10:02,203
That's easy...

134
00:10:03,212 --> 00:10:04,109
Blow them away!

135
00:10:07,129 --> 00:10:08,383
That's very impressive...

136
00:10:09,004 --> 00:10:09,709
Too bad.

137
00:10:13,156 --> 00:10:15,620
Well? I made short work of those.

138
00:10:16,496 --> 00:10:17,449
Are we done ye...

139
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:32,838
I expected you to give me more trouble than that...

140
00:10:33,457 --> 00:10:34,760
Is that really all you've got?

141
00:10:35,174 --> 00:10:36,109
Level 5?

142
00:10:37,674 --> 00:10:39,549
I suppose you'll hold it against me.

143
00:10:43,046 --> 00:10:44,795
Look at that... I caught you.

144
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,183
Impossible!

145
00:10:47,588 --> 00:10:49,911
You used magnetics to make yourself a shield.

146
00:10:50,504 --> 00:10:52,564
I'll shock you at point blank range.

147
00:10:53,001 --> 00:10:55,163
It didn't work against this idiot I know...

148
00:10:55,438 --> 00:10:59,103
but I don't think even you possess an
ability as out of this world as his is.

149
00:11:00,671 --> 00:11:01,504
Too slow!

150
00:11:12,163 --> 00:11:14,415
I admit, I did hold back on you a little.

151
00:11:14,796 --> 00:11:15,387
Teacher?

152
00:11:15,684 --> 00:11:16,811
Teacher!

153
00:11:17,058 --> 00:11:17,722
What the...?

154
00:11:17,796 --> 00:11:18,180
Teacher!

155
00:11:18,205 --> 00:11:20,069
I'm hearing this directly in my head.

156
00:11:20,094 --> 00:11:21,165
Teacher!

157
00:11:21,298 --> 00:11:21,941
Am I...

158
00:11:21,965 --> 00:11:22,296
Teacher!

159
00:11:22,338 --> 00:11:24,479
Am I hearing Dr. Kiyama's memories?

160
00:11:24,504 --> 00:11:25,416
Teacher?

161
00:11:25,444 --> 00:11:29,127
I must have created an electrical circuit
between us that allows me to hear them.

162
00:11:29,661 --> 00:11:30,548
Teacher!

163
00:11:33,846 --> 00:11:35,164
Hi, Miss Kiyama!

164
00:11:37,475 --> 00:11:38,646
Me, a teacher?

165
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,355
This must be some kind of joke, right?

166
00:11:41,522 --> 00:11:42,379
Not at all...

167
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:46,209
Why, is there a problem? You do
have a teaching certificate, don't you?

168
00:11:46,379 --> 00:11:46,947
Yes.

169
00:11:47,796 --> 00:11:52,216
In that case what could be out of place
about you taking up a position as a teacher?

170
00:11:52,286 --> 00:11:55,155
That certificate's just something
I happened to get along the way.

171
00:11:55,209 --> 00:11:57,245
I know research is your preferred area...

172
00:11:57,438 --> 00:11:58,968
I'm not asking you to give it up.

173
00:11:59,963 --> 00:12:01,165
Far from it in fact,

174
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:05,824
I'm asking you to head up a high level experiment
that's being backed by the board of directors themselves.

175
00:12:06,078 --> 00:12:07,144
You really mean it?

176
00:12:07,896 --> 00:12:09,662
You see those children down there?

177
00:12:10,754 --> 00:12:13,611
They're what we refer to as "Child Errors."

178
00:12:13,867 --> 00:12:16,733
For whatever reason, they were
abandoned here in Academy City.

179
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:18,289
They have no other family.

180
00:12:18,979 --> 00:12:19,482
Ah...

181
00:12:20,101 --> 00:12:22,435
They are also the subjects of this experiment.

182
00:12:22,796 --> 00:12:24,838
As well as the students who you will be teaching.

183
00:12:26,426 --> 00:12:30,221
In order for the experiment to succeed,
we will need to keep detailed growth data

184
00:12:30,246 --> 00:12:35,467
on each one of the subjects, analyze them meticulously,
and make any necessary adjustments as time goes on.

185
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:40,044
I'm sure you can see that having their
teacher handle that will save a lot of trouble.

186
00:12:41,086 --> 00:12:41,935
I guess so.

187
00:12:42,671 --> 00:12:44,199
It does sound more efficient.

188
00:12:51,019 --> 00:12:55,902
Uh... my name is Harumi Kiyama and
starting today I'm going to be your teacher.

189
00:12:56,454 --> 00:12:57,311
Nice to meet you.

190
00:12:57,438 --> 00:12:59,559
Nice to meet you, too, teacher!

191
00:13:00,915 --> 00:13:02,581
This is not gonna be easy.

192
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:11,322
Ha... ha...! She fell for it!

193
00:13:11,788 --> 00:13:13,379
We got the Teacher! We got the Teacher!

194
00:13:13,404 --> 00:13:14,604
Hey, you two!

195
00:13:14,847 --> 00:13:16,669
Are you okay Miss Kiyama?

196
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:20,512
Yeah... It's a sunny day. This
shouldn't take long to dry outside.

197
00:13:22,726 --> 00:13:24,726
You can't change your clothes out here!

198
00:13:24,751 --> 00:13:26,799
Boys! Look away, right now!

199
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:27,771
Seriously, you can't do that in the middle of a classroom!

200
00:13:27,796 --> 00:13:29,046
Aw, gimme a break.

201
00:13:29,071 --> 00:13:31,765
It's not like we'd be interested
in a flat chest like that anyway.

202
00:13:33,069 --> 00:13:34,672
Me...? Flat-chested?

203
00:13:35,421 --> 00:13:36,571
I hate children.

204
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,097
They have no decency.

205
00:13:38,736 --> 00:13:40,711
You're not really very pretty, Teacher...

206
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:42,117
Do you have a boyfriend?

207
00:13:42,309 --> 00:13:43,633
Wh... what was that?

208
00:13:43,937 --> 00:13:46,591
Didn't think so. But I'll be your boyfriend if you want.

209
00:13:47,692 --> 00:13:49,062
They have no manners.

210
00:13:50,126 --> 00:13:51,747
And if you'll just look at your books...

211
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:57,977
They play stupid pranks.

212
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:00,543
I see that you're sad...

213
00:14:00,921 --> 00:14:03,713
If there's something bothering
you, I'd be happy to listen.

214
00:14:06,631 --> 00:14:08,058
They're far too emotional.

215
00:14:10,794 --> 00:14:13,674
Hey...! You can't be fussy. Eat it all!

216
00:14:16,248 --> 00:14:19,212
They're overly familiar, and
they become attached too quickly.

217
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:25,155
I really hate children.

218
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:33,441
Edasaki. What's wrong?

219
00:14:33,713 --> 00:14:35,254
Oh, Miss Kiyama!

220
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,915
I slipped in the rain and fell.

221
00:14:41,891 --> 00:14:43,555
My apartment isn't far from here...

222
00:14:43,956 --> 00:14:44,968
Would you like to wash up?

223
00:14:45,524 --> 00:14:46,524
You mean it?!

224
00:14:49,736 --> 00:14:51,611
Wow! A bathtub!

225
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:53,447
Is taking a bath that exciting?

226
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:57,499
Yeah. At my facility, we only get two showers a week.

227
00:14:59,407 --> 00:15:01,248
So... can I really use it?

228
00:15:02,504 --> 00:15:02,933
Yeah.

229
00:15:03,357 --> 00:15:06,324
Hooray...! I'm gonna brag to all the others!

230
00:15:20,683 --> 00:15:21,475
Teacher?

231
00:15:23,158 --> 00:15:28,062
Do you think if I tried really hard, I
could make it to Level 4 or even 5 someday?

232
00:15:29,071 --> 00:15:31,805
At this stage it's too early to know one way or the other.

233
00:15:32,715 --> 00:15:34,942
Do you want to be a high-level Esper when you get older?

234
00:15:37,111 --> 00:15:39,191
Well, of course. I mean, who wouldn't?

235
00:15:39,487 --> 00:15:42,766
But Academy City's going to all this trouble to raise me.

236
00:15:43,858 --> 00:15:47,278
I'd like an ability that would
help the city in return, you know?

237
00:16:02,937 --> 00:16:05,958
With all this work, I have no
time for my research anymore...

238
00:16:07,295 --> 00:16:09,064
Teaching is a real pain in the neck.

239
00:16:15,463 --> 00:16:16,588
On top of which...

240
00:16:19,296 --> 00:16:20,500
I hate children.

241
00:16:23,603 --> 00:16:25,728
They're indelicate, annoying, and loud.

242
00:16:26,305 --> 00:16:29,104
Hey, Teacher... will you be my girlfriend, please?

243
00:16:29,129 --> 00:16:30,055
Yeah, whatever.

244
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,375
They have no manners.

245
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:33,612
Yay!

246
00:16:33,637 --> 00:16:35,173
They play stupid pranks.

247
00:16:35,649 --> 00:16:37,251
Oh... is that me?

248
00:16:37,389 --> 00:16:37,842
Mhm!

249
00:16:38,201 --> 00:16:39,606
They're far too emotional.

250
00:16:40,153 --> 00:16:42,236
It's a surprise party just for you!

251
00:16:42,284 --> 00:16:43,728
Happy birthday, Teacher!

252
00:16:43,811 --> 00:16:44,734
How old are you now?

253
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:45,353
Aren't you surprised?

254
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:47,066
Do you like the decorations?

255
00:16:55,254 --> 00:16:56,488
What did we say?

256
00:16:57,421 --> 00:16:58,578
You have to eat it all.

257
00:16:58,603 --> 00:16:59,189
Right.

258
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:09,027
I knew you could do it!

259
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:11,109
Children are...

260
00:17:20,034 --> 00:17:21,286
You'll feel a slight prick.

261
00:17:24,964 --> 00:17:26,188
Anything unusual here?

262
00:17:26,304 --> 00:17:27,705
No, no problems so far.

263
00:17:28,046 --> 00:17:28,864
We're fine, too.

264
00:17:29,067 --> 00:17:30,213
Okay, great.

265
00:17:34,588 --> 00:17:35,468
Are you frightened?

266
00:17:35,925 --> 00:17:39,422
Not one bit. After all, you're in
charge of this experiment, aren't you?

267
00:17:39,572 --> 00:17:41,417
I completely trust you, Teacher.

268
00:17:45,703 --> 00:17:48,296
Do I finally get to stop playing teacher now?

269
00:17:51,619 --> 00:17:52,978
Dopamine levels are dropping!

270
00:17:53,065 --> 00:17:55,219
Anticholinergics are having no effect!

271
00:17:55,437 --> 00:17:57,722
Hypovolemic shock is setting in from the burns.

272
00:17:58,068 --> 00:18:00,448
Lactated Ringer's solution. Transfusion, stat!

273
00:18:00,473 --> 00:18:02,050
There's nothing more we can do.

274
00:18:02,574 --> 00:18:04,013
Uh... Hurry and contact the hospital!

275
00:18:04,144 --> 00:18:06,330
No... we won't do anything of the sort.

276
00:18:06,605 --> 00:18:08,192
But if we don't do something right now...

277
00:18:08,217 --> 00:18:12,013
Are you a scientist or not? Don't get
frantic, just gather all the data you can.

278
00:18:12,844 --> 00:18:15,583
I'm ordering you to keep this
experiment strictly in-house.

279
00:18:16,945 --> 00:18:19,450
Everything was completed here without any incident.

280
00:18:19,934 --> 00:18:22,110
Nobody saw anything out of the ordinary...

281
00:18:22,772 --> 00:18:23,499
Understood?

282
00:18:24,058 --> 00:18:25,144
Y... Yes, sir.

283
00:18:28,311 --> 00:18:30,660
Don't worry you did your job and you did it well...

284
00:18:31,004 --> 00:18:32,948
It is a pity this had to happen to them.

285
00:18:34,215 --> 00:18:37,157
But that's how scientific progress is made, after all.

286
00:18:39,749 --> 00:18:42,768
You don't need to worry yourself
about this little accident.

287
00:18:43,471 --> 00:18:46,304
I'm still expecting great things from you in the future.

288
00:19:09,956 --> 00:19:10,782
What was that?

289
00:19:12,338 --> 00:19:14,531
You saw what they... we did?

290
00:19:21,109 --> 00:19:22,970
Half the street's been blown away.

291
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:31,791
It's Misaka!

292
00:19:32,775 --> 00:19:33,179
What...

293
00:19:34,043 --> 00:19:35,108
What were they doing?

294
00:19:39,907 --> 00:19:41,545
On the record or off of it?

295
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:46,152
Officially, it was designed as a test
in controlling AIM diffusion fields.

296
00:19:46,615 --> 00:19:48,464
but... the real study...

297
00:19:49,086 --> 00:19:52,651
was on the effects of pushing an
ability beyond its natural limit.

298
00:19:53,365 --> 00:19:59,428
They over-stimulated the children's AIM diffusion
fields in order to study runaway abilities first-hand.

299
00:19:59,838 --> 00:20:00,261
Then...

300
00:20:00,683 --> 00:20:03,647
They were intentionally manipulated to run out of control.

301
00:20:04,293 --> 00:20:07,134
but I didn't realize what was
going on until after it happened.

302
00:20:08,671 --> 00:20:11,122
Experiments... on the children.

303
00:20:11,713 --> 00:20:13,030
Innocent little kids...

304
00:20:13,674 --> 00:20:15,310
And even after all this time...

305
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:17,241
they still haven't woken up.

306
00:20:17,756 --> 00:20:20,165
We stole their youth from them, and for what?

307
00:20:20,506 --> 00:20:22,620
To turn them into laboratory rats?!

308
00:20:24,065 --> 00:20:24,461
But...

309
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:28,671
If something that terrible happened,
why didn't you report it to Antiskill?

310
00:20:28,812 --> 00:20:29,949
23 times.

311
00:20:30,921 --> 00:20:33,675
That's how many times I requested to use Tree Diagram...

312
00:20:34,219 --> 00:20:38,204
If I could just get access to it, I
could use it to find a way to revive them...

313
00:20:38,546 --> 00:20:42,009
I could run simulations to uncover
the true cause of the accident.

314
00:20:42,549 --> 00:20:45,868
Tree Diagram is the greatest
supercomputer in Academy City...

315
00:20:46,194 --> 00:20:48,571
If I'd had it, I could have brought those children back...

316
00:20:48,844 --> 00:20:53,306
I could've set them free to laugh and run and
play in the park like children are supposed to.

317
00:20:53,838 --> 00:20:57,088
But I was always turned down!
Twenty-three times, they said "no"!

318
00:20:58,088 --> 00:20:59,003
Don't you get it?

319
00:20:59,121 --> 00:21:00,974
The board of directors was in on it!

320
00:21:01,088 --> 00:21:03,016
There's no way Antiskill would act!

321
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:05,420
There must have been a better solution than this!

322
00:21:05,454 --> 00:21:06,749
You understand nothing!

323
00:21:08,075 --> 00:21:09,912
I would do anything to save them.

324
00:21:10,124 --> 00:21:12,283
Anything in the entire world!

325
00:21:12,308 --> 00:21:17,235
The whole city can hate and revile me. I don't
care! I'm not going to let anything stop me now!

326
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:23,776
Hey... what's wrong?

327
00:21:25,064 --> 00:21:27,550
The network... it's out of control.

328
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:44,672
Oh, gosh... what's that?!

329
00:21:45,418 --> 00:21:46,368
A fetus?

330
00:23:30,674 --> 00:23:32,606
I'm putting a stop to Kiyama's scheme...

331
00:23:32,726 --> 00:23:35,045
I will find a way to save Saten and the others...

332
00:23:35,254 --> 00:23:36,521
But what is that thing?!

333
00:23:36,633 --> 00:23:39,325
Nobody said anything about fighting a monster!
