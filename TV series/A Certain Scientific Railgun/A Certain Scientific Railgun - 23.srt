1
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:14,078
Hello there, Haru'ue.

2
00:00:14,587 --> 00:00:15,538
Your friends are here.

3
00:00:19,046 --> 00:00:20,514
You said my friends were here.

4
00:00:20,827 --> 00:00:22,696
You mean Uiharu and the others?

5
00:00:23,181 --> 00:00:24,548
Well, why don't we just see?

6
00:00:45,589 --> 00:00:47,499
It's... Banri?

7
00:00:48,623 --> 00:00:50,422
Yes! It is you!

8
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:53,093
Incredible!

9
00:00:53,877 --> 00:00:55,730
You're here. I can't believe it!

10
00:00:57,458 --> 00:01:00,228
I need to tell Uiharu about this right away!

11
00:02:33,882 --> 00:02:39,520
So, the ten child subjects who've been missing
are now securely installed at MAR's laboratory?

12
00:02:40,009 --> 00:02:40,549
Yes.

13
00:02:41,066 --> 00:02:42,805
They've been found, finally.

14
00:02:43,557 --> 00:02:45,057
Isn't that great, Uiharu?

15
00:02:45,223 --> 00:02:46,584
Oh... yeah.

16
00:02:46,841 --> 00:02:51,200
And the woman responsible for the Level
Upper incident is behind this situation as well.

17
00:02:51,613 --> 00:02:55,944
She said that she didn't care if the city was
destroyed, so long as the children were saved?

18
00:02:56,378 --> 00:02:58,661
That's a pretty extreme stance, wouldn't you say?

19
00:02:59,636 --> 00:03:04,016
So, Therestina said she's going to find
a way to wake up Edasaki and the others?

20
00:03:04,748 --> 00:03:05,257
Huh?

21
00:03:06,056 --> 00:03:07,495
Oh... yeah.

22
00:03:08,001 --> 00:03:10,292
Well, then, it sounds like we've closed the case.

23
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:11,429
Excellent work!

24
00:03:12,509 --> 00:03:13,551
Is something the matter?

25
00:03:15,464 --> 00:03:16,228
It's nothing.

26
00:03:17,889 --> 00:03:19,969
I know you all too well, Sissy.

27
00:03:20,206 --> 00:03:22,908
I'm guessing you're still
concerned about Kiyama, aren't you?

28
00:03:24,025 --> 00:03:28,424
You still aren't convinced it was the right idea
to have the children taken away from her, right?

29
00:03:29,248 --> 00:03:30,466
I'm just not sure.

30
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:31,585
Well, be sure.

31
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:32,953
You made the right choice.

32
00:03:33,817 --> 00:03:35,900
At least that's what I believe, anyway.

33
00:03:37,601 --> 00:03:38,014
Right.

34
00:03:39,248 --> 00:03:40,157
Even so.

35
00:03:40,651 --> 00:03:42,445
You crossed the line this time, Sissy!

36
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,598
Going into a place like that on your own?

37
00:03:44,623 --> 00:03:46,598
If anything had happened to you, I
don't know what I would have done!

38
00:03:46,623 --> 00:03:47,468
Hello, there.

39
00:03:48,127 --> 00:03:50,229
You're spacing out now. Are you okay?

40
00:03:50,253 --> 00:03:51,821
Oh... yeah.

41
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:54,815
Come on. Aren't you anxious to see how Haru'ue's doing?

42
00:03:54,988 --> 00:03:57,113
Well.. Yeah... I guess.

43
00:03:57,344 --> 00:03:58,987
She'll be thrilled to see you!

44
00:03:59,756 --> 00:04:00,595
Let's get a move on!

45
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,640
Hey! All this pushing isn't really necessary!

46
00:04:02,665 --> 00:04:04,890
Now, now, you don't want to keep her waiting, do you?

47
00:04:04,915 --> 00:04:05,645
Let go!

48
00:04:09,926 --> 00:04:11,191
Thrilled to see me, huh?

49
00:04:11,579 --> 00:04:14,090
Well... maybe I should bring her some things.

50
00:04:16,737 --> 00:04:18,156
Let's see here...

51
00:04:18,555 --> 00:04:22,319
Snacks, a game, some reading material...

52
00:04:22,535 --> 00:04:23,394
And what else?

53
00:04:25,045 --> 00:04:27,087
Changes of clothing, of course!

54
00:04:33,935 --> 00:04:35,993
Waiting isn't good enough anymore.

55
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:38,061
I need to start looking for her.

56
00:04:38,902 --> 00:04:40,140
Oh, Haru'ue.

57
00:04:40,394 --> 00:04:42,056
I'm so proud of you.

58
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:47,005
I would do anything to save them.

59
00:04:47,207 --> 00:04:49,222
anything in the entire world!

60
00:04:49,276 --> 00:04:54,299
The whole city can hate and revile me. I don't
care! I'm not going to let anything stop me now!

61
00:05:08,248 --> 00:05:09,372
I'm sorry, Doctor.

62
00:05:09,978 --> 00:05:11,318
I don't have anything yet.

63
00:05:11,355 --> 00:05:12,174
I... um...

64
00:05:16,103 --> 00:05:17,411
Oh, it's you.

65
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:22,169
I have this friend, Haru'ue.

66
00:05:22,801 --> 00:05:25,064
Maybe you've already heard of her by now.

67
00:05:26,054 --> 00:05:28,637
I actually haven't known her for very long.

68
00:05:29,793 --> 00:05:33,913
But she did tell me that she and Banri
Edasaki were friends when they were little.

69
00:05:34,327 --> 00:05:35,577
And.. you see...

70
00:05:35,748 --> 00:05:37,236
Haru'ue is a telepath.

71
00:05:37,611 --> 00:05:41,867
Every time one of the poltergeisting incidents
occurred, she could hear Edasaki's voice.

72
00:05:42,311 --> 00:05:45,666
Because of the way she acted, she
was suspected of being responsible.

73
00:05:46,158 --> 00:05:50,544
Even so, she did everything she could
to hear what Edasaki was saying to her.

74
00:05:51,359 --> 00:05:54,330
But now Edasaki isn't missing anymore...

75
00:05:54,634 --> 00:05:55,173
so...

76
00:06:00,765 --> 00:06:01,585
Surely...

77
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:07,044
Surely, Haru'ue must be happy
with the way things have turned out.

78
00:06:07,472 --> 00:06:08,896
So, what are you trying to say?

79
00:06:09,837 --> 00:06:11,032
I don't really know.

80
00:06:12,016 --> 00:06:13,946
I just thought I should tell you.

81
00:06:23,232 --> 00:06:26,073
I was so close to finishing the
vaccine that would help them...

82
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:29,354
All I needed was to get my hands on the First Sample.

83
00:06:30,673 --> 00:06:33,135
I could have gotten their runaway abilities under control.

84
00:06:34,212 --> 00:06:36,193
I could have awakened them at last.

85
00:06:41,885 --> 00:06:43,591
I could have brought them back!

86
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,196
Dr. Kiyama.

87
00:06:53,381 --> 00:06:56,246
Let's collect all of your data and take it to MAR.

88
00:06:56,285 --> 00:06:57,970
It's bound to be of some use.

89
00:06:57,995 --> 00:07:00,815
And then they'd let us in to see Edasaki and the others.

90
00:07:03,603 --> 00:07:05,110
I couldn't possibly.

91
00:07:06,207 --> 00:07:07,790
I know that's what you want.

92
00:07:07,952 --> 00:07:09,147
Let's go see them!

93
00:07:15,129 --> 00:07:16,656
How can I say no to that?

94
00:07:18,843 --> 00:07:21,686
Wow, you came all the way out
here to bring me your research?

95
00:07:22,498 --> 00:07:23,331
That's right.

96
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:27,973
Although... we were also hoping we could
see how the children were getting along here.

97
00:07:27,998 --> 00:07:29,290
That's not possible.

98
00:07:30,307 --> 00:07:32,165
We had to transfer the children.

99
00:07:32,628 --> 00:07:35,454
They will be going to a facility that's better equipped.

100
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:37,225
Okay. Which facility?

101
00:07:37,389 --> 00:07:40,006
I'm sorry, but I can't disclose that information.

102
00:07:40,142 --> 00:07:43,360
You'll just have to take my word
that they'll be well taken care of.

103
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:47,587
From here on out, MAR will be
responsible for their treatment.

104
00:07:48,515 --> 00:07:49,494
And another thing.

105
00:07:49,801 --> 00:07:51,107
Haru'ue will be staying with us.

106
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,498
What? But, why?

107
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,256
Well, as you know, she's spent a long
time waiting to see her friend again.

108
00:07:56,502 --> 00:07:57,963
She wants to stay by her side.

109
00:07:58,752 --> 00:07:59,471
Really?

110
00:08:01,245 --> 00:08:02,147
Here, pick one.

111
00:08:02,539 --> 00:08:04,023
Um... one, what?

112
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:05,349
Why, a color...

113
00:08:05,496 --> 00:08:09,730
If the color you choose is the one that comes
out, I'll let you see Haru'ue and the others.

114
00:08:09,966 --> 00:08:10,775
Well... um...

115
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,299
So indecisive!

116
00:08:12,406 --> 00:08:14,364
Well, why don't we choose yellow?

117
00:08:14,534 --> 00:08:14,932
Here.

118
00:08:16,645 --> 00:08:18,265
Aw, it's a brown one.

119
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:19,307
What a shame, huh?

120
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,352
This is no time to be playing games!

121
00:08:21,377 --> 00:08:23,086
Oh, I'm not playing at anything.

122
00:08:24,353 --> 00:08:26,936
Uh-oh... I'm so sorry about that.

123
00:08:27,326 --> 00:08:28,265
I don't understand.

124
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:29,187
What's going on?

125
00:08:29,755 --> 00:08:33,205
Oh, well. It's not as if the
data will be of any use anyway.

126
00:08:34,912 --> 00:08:36,517
Director Kihara, it's about time.

127
00:08:37,623 --> 00:08:38,390
One moment.

128
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,093
Kihara?

129
00:08:40,605 --> 00:08:42,279
Oh, you mean you didn't know that?

130
00:08:42,718 --> 00:08:44,359
That's my middle name, you see.

131
00:08:44,582 --> 00:08:45,354
Kihara.

132
00:08:45,978 --> 00:08:48,737
In full, Therestina Kihara Lifeline.

133
00:08:50,286 --> 00:08:51,336
Why, you...!

134
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:00,098
Dr. Kiyama! Are you okay?

135
00:09:00,201 --> 00:09:01,561
Say something please!

136
00:09:02,982 --> 00:09:05,079
We're terribly busy, you understand.

137
00:09:05,277 --> 00:09:08,332
I hope you won't mind if I ask you to show yourselves out.

138
00:09:13,184 --> 00:09:14,258
Here, have some tea.

139
00:09:15,311 --> 00:09:16,728
You seem to be in a good mood.

140
00:09:16,827 --> 00:09:18,119
Well, why wouldn't I be?

141
00:09:18,144 --> 00:09:20,880
It's a relief to have the
poltergeisting case closed, finally.

142
00:09:21,246 --> 00:09:23,267
We can go back to our everyday lives again.

143
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:25,061
Uh-huh...

144
00:09:25,101 --> 00:09:27,770
I know you guys have been a
little bit out of sorts lately,

145
00:09:27,928 --> 00:09:30,074
but now everything can get back to normal.

146
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,379
Isn't that right, Shirai?

147
00:09:32,009 --> 00:09:34,365
I haven't behaved any differently than usual.

148
00:09:34,734 --> 00:09:35,087
Here.

149
00:09:41,435 --> 00:09:45,173
I know! I'll give Uiharu a call and see
when Haru'ue is getting out of the hospital.

150
00:09:45,457 --> 00:09:47,261
It is practically the height of summer.

151
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:48,515
We should enjoy it.

152
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:49,874
You're right about that.

153
00:09:50,665 --> 00:09:52,352
Hey, Uiharu. It's Saten.

154
00:09:52,522 --> 00:09:53,313
Where are you?

155
00:09:53,338 --> 00:09:54,704
S... S... Saten...

156
00:09:56,657 --> 00:09:57,406
What's wrong?

157
00:09:57,891 --> 00:09:58,377
It's...

158
00:09:59,073 --> 00:09:59,615
Oh...

159
00:10:00,306 --> 00:10:00,814
Saten!

160
00:10:01,071 --> 00:10:02,086
What's the matter?

161
00:10:02,417 --> 00:10:03,332
Uiharu!

162
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,543
Come on, I can't understand through all the sniffling.

163
00:10:07,985 --> 00:10:08,648
What is it?

164
00:10:11,455 --> 00:10:12,874
Finally, this is it.

165
00:10:13,242 --> 00:10:16,520
I've finished gathering all the
material about the poltergeisting.

166
00:10:16,545 --> 00:10:18,127
Well, go ahead and get rid of it.

167
00:10:18,654 --> 00:10:21,415
I got a call from the MAR laboratory just now.

168
00:10:21,498 --> 00:10:24,164
They said they have all the information they require.

169
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,057
Aw, man. This took me so long!

170
00:10:27,129 --> 00:10:28,788
Did they say anything more?

171
00:10:28,905 --> 00:10:31,838
Nope. They said "it's over now" and left it at that.

172
00:10:32,144 --> 00:10:34,730
Doesn't that seem a little... unusual?

173
00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:40,816
Her name's Therestina Kihara?

174
00:10:40,978 --> 00:10:42,470
Are you sure that's what she said?

175
00:10:42,998 --> 00:10:44,457
And Kiyama, what about her?

176
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:46,464
I don't know.

177
00:10:46,941 --> 00:10:49,168
She went... somewhere...

178
00:10:49,193 --> 00:10:50,035
Take it easy.

179
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:51,816
It's gonna be okay.

180
00:10:52,053 --> 00:10:52,438
Huh?

181
00:10:52,608 --> 00:10:53,172
Found her.

182
00:10:53,746 --> 00:10:55,920
Yes, Therestina Kihara Lifeline.

183
00:10:56,158 --> 00:10:58,074
Gensei Kihara's granddaughter.

184
00:10:58,342 --> 00:10:58,816
Oh, my.

185
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,990
What, is there more?

186
00:11:00,149 --> 00:11:04,828
She's included in the personnel data from
Kihara's lab, from the time he wrote his thesis.

187
00:11:04,957 --> 00:11:05,918
What does that mean?

188
00:11:05,943 --> 00:11:08,341
Therestina was Kihara's research assistant?

189
00:11:08,623 --> 00:11:09,994
That would make sense, wouldn't it?

190
00:11:10,676 --> 00:11:11,518
Wait a second!

191
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:13,790
What is it?

192
00:11:16,466 --> 00:11:19,882
Therestina was the first test
subject for the ability crystal.

193
00:11:20,123 --> 00:11:21,115
How can that be?

194
00:11:22,259 --> 00:11:23,888
Whoa, let me get this straight.

195
00:11:24,123 --> 00:11:28,146
You're telling me Kihara's first human
experiment was on his own granddaughter

196
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:30,894
and that Therestina helped with his research?

197
00:11:31,002 --> 00:11:34,207
The same woman who has the
Child Errors under her protection?

198
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:35,241
What's going on?!

199
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:37,607
Don't ask me! I'm just as confused as anybody.

200
00:11:40,143 --> 00:11:41,946
What... What do we do?

201
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:43,590
I can't believe it!

202
00:11:43,777 --> 00:11:44,723
How is this happening?

203
00:11:44,748 --> 00:11:46,346
Please try to stop crying.

204
00:11:46,621 --> 00:11:47,442
I can't!

205
00:11:47,979 --> 00:11:52,021
Haru'ue... Edasaki... all the other children...

206
00:11:54,195 --> 00:11:55,159
It's okay.

207
00:11:55,508 --> 00:11:56,365
What now?

208
00:11:56,682 --> 00:11:57,971
I've failed them all!

209
00:11:58,210 --> 00:11:59,415
What do I do?

210
00:12:04,537 --> 00:12:07,512
Tell me, how much longer are
you going to sit there, crying?

211
00:12:08,738 --> 00:12:10,260
You.. hit me...

212
00:12:10,697 --> 00:12:13,280
Isn't there something more useful you could be doing?

213
00:12:14,506 --> 00:12:18,198
When are you going to get a hold of
yourself and act like a Judgment officer again?

214
00:12:24,815 --> 00:12:26,029
Let me take over.

215
00:12:28,035 --> 00:12:28,805
If you want.

216
00:12:29,296 --> 00:12:32,988
Checking for probable locations
where the children would have been sent.

217
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:45,124
Where's Misaka?

218
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:48,708
Sissy...

219
00:13:04,224 --> 00:13:04,686
Here.

220
00:13:05,819 --> 00:13:07,277
You can use this to dry off.

221
00:13:07,515 --> 00:13:08,657
Great, thanks a lot!

222
00:13:09,867 --> 00:13:12,730
I can't believe Kongo's been
in the hospital this entire time.

223
00:13:12,755 --> 00:13:13,816
It seems excessive.

224
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:15,976
Is her condition really that serious?

225
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:17,285
I'm kind of worried about her.

226
00:13:17,492 --> 00:13:19,333
Maybe we should go pay her a visit, then.

227
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:21,376
Yeah, good idea.

228
00:13:29,146 --> 00:13:30,848
Ignore her. Keep moving.

229
00:13:36,362 --> 00:13:37,513
I should tell you.

230
00:13:37,769 --> 00:13:40,549
The children were aboard the
trucks that passed by just now.

231
00:13:41,223 --> 00:13:42,660
Don't you want to go after them?

232
00:13:43,196 --> 00:13:44,223
You tricked us.

233
00:13:46,255 --> 00:13:47,356
Are you angry?

234
00:13:47,803 --> 00:13:49,794
I want to know what you've got up your sleeve.

235
00:13:50,223 --> 00:13:52,059
You make it sound so sinister.

236
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,744
You are Gensei Kihara's granddaughter.

237
00:13:55,046 --> 00:13:58,350
You were also the first test
subject for the ability crystal.

238
00:13:58,767 --> 00:14:01,308
Used as a lab rat by your own flesh and blood.

239
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:05,256
And yet, you're still assisting
with your grandfather's research.

240
00:14:05,663 --> 00:14:07,580
Using the children as you were used.

241
00:14:07,605 --> 00:14:09,333
So, tell me, what are you planning?!

242
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:14,486
You've done your homework, haven't you.

243
00:14:14,755 --> 00:14:19,803
But what you still don't seem to realize is
that I don't answer to anybody other than myself.

244
00:14:20,095 --> 00:14:20,939
Moron!

245
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:24,935
And now you're going to try forcing me to reveal my plans.

246
00:14:30,424 --> 00:14:31,245
That sound.

247
00:14:31,562 --> 00:14:32,915
It's Capacity Down!

248
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,566
You're familiar with it, then?

249
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,021
Why do you have it, though?

250
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:38,540
Why wouldn't I have it?

251
00:14:38,582 --> 00:14:40,692
I am its creator, after all!

252
00:14:44,705 --> 00:14:45,377
You are?

253
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:50,549
As it happens, I gathered a lot of helpful information
from loaning it out to those idiots in Skill Out.

254
00:14:50,574 --> 00:14:53,361
So this new version is significantly more powerful.

255
00:14:53,694 --> 00:14:56,694
Though that did require making
the device a good deal larger.

256
00:14:56,931 --> 00:15:00,782
Apparently, even a band of fools
like Skill Out can be somewhat useful.

257
00:15:06,435 --> 00:15:07,924
Stop screwing around with me.

258
00:15:08,896 --> 00:15:09,403
Huh?

259
00:15:09,644 --> 00:15:11,144
Using Skill Out, too?!

260
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:13,998
They aren't your lab rats!

261
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,984
No need for hysterics.

262
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:22,760
I missed.

263
00:15:22,942 --> 00:15:24,386
Calibration's a bit off

264
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:26,984
but I guess that'll just draw the fun out a little longer.

265
00:15:29,802 --> 00:15:31,313
Why, you!

266
00:15:33,936 --> 00:15:34,817
My power...

267
00:15:35,006 --> 00:15:38,503
Poor girl. Haven't you noticed that
none of your attacks are reaching me?

268
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:45,415
Keep running, my darling Level
Five, but it won't do you any good.

269
00:15:50,912 --> 00:15:53,204
Goodness. What on earth is going on out there?

270
00:15:55,891 --> 00:15:56,896
All that smoke.

271
00:15:57,228 --> 00:15:58,971
It looks like a disaster area.

272
00:15:59,825 --> 00:16:01,502
Huh? Isn't that.

273
00:16:02,013 --> 00:16:02,965
It's Misaka!

274
00:16:13,902 --> 00:16:16,999
People like you and your friends
are such fascinating specimens.

275
00:16:17,024 --> 00:16:19,815
In thrall to your own naive sense of justice.

276
00:16:20,137 --> 00:16:21,502
I owe you my gratitude.

277
00:16:21,702 --> 00:16:25,224
It's all thanks to you that I was
able to track down the test subjects.

278
00:16:25,707 --> 00:16:28,124
As a reward, I'll let you in on a little secret.

279
00:16:28,149 --> 00:16:32,257
I needed access to those children because
I intend to perfect the ability crystal.

280
00:16:32,354 --> 00:16:34,146
No... You... can't...

281
00:16:37,669 --> 00:16:38,712
Oh, can't I?

282
00:16:38,737 --> 00:16:40,487
Who's going to stand in my way?

283
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,497
We've got a new candidate for experimentation.

284
00:16:46,915 --> 00:16:48,173
Someone take her away.

285
00:16:55,915 --> 00:16:56,899
Just a moment!

286
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:00,616
I'll have you know, that girl
you're carrying is a friend of mine.

287
00:17:02,391 --> 00:17:06,208
And you do not want to cross Mitsuko
Kongo of Tokiwadai Middle School!

288
00:17:09,347 --> 00:17:11,009
All units, report status.

289
00:17:11,034 --> 00:17:12,415
Yellow Marble. Good to go.

290
00:17:12,587 --> 00:17:13,887
Brown Marble. Good to go.

291
00:17:14,448 --> 00:17:16,578
All units, you are clear to proceed as planned...

292
00:17:16,603 --> 00:17:17,690
This is Blue Marble reporting.

293
00:17:17,883 --> 00:17:19,005
We've lost Railgun!

294
00:17:19,302 --> 00:17:19,985
You what?!

295
00:17:20,196 --> 00:17:21,139
I apologize.

296
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,956
We're currently searching the surrounding area.

297
00:17:23,194 --> 00:17:23,906
We'll find her.

298
00:17:24,269 --> 00:17:25,142
Never mind!

299
00:17:25,238 --> 00:17:27,803
But I will not soon forget today's incompetence!

300
00:17:33,347 --> 00:17:34,215
Sissy!

301
00:17:34,385 --> 00:17:35,787
Misaka! Are you all right?

302
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:38,210
How do you feel? Are you hurt at all?

303
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:40,419
I'm confused...

304
00:17:40,603 --> 00:17:41,451
What happened?

305
00:17:42,082 --> 00:17:45,073
Well, I'm not one to brag, but
it all worked out, thanks to me.

306
00:17:45,098 --> 00:17:49,885
I'm certain you'd love to hear all about my heroic
rescue but really, there isn't that much to tell.

307
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:52,297
Oh, all right, if you insist.

308
00:17:52,322 --> 00:17:55,258
I'd hate to deprive you of a
thrilling tale of selflessness.

309
00:17:55,508 --> 00:17:57,607
Really? So Kongo saved me?

310
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,659
Therestina.

311
00:18:02,377 --> 00:18:03,793
Sit back down, Sissy.

312
00:18:03,838 --> 00:18:05,115
You need to rest some more.

313
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,261
Get out of my way.

314
00:18:06,892 --> 00:18:09,522
I don't have time to be lounging around in bed now.

315
00:18:10,082 --> 00:18:11,032
I need to go.

316
00:18:11,317 --> 00:18:12,867
I have to help the children!

317
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:15,043
You're staying here, Sissy.

318
00:18:15,389 --> 00:18:19,198
What a fool! I snuck into the
laboratory on my own and lost my temper.

319
00:18:19,658 --> 00:18:23,116
I found the children, but I led
Therestina straight to them as well.

320
00:18:24,273 --> 00:18:25,476
And now they're all gone.

321
00:18:26,222 --> 00:18:28,304
They're gone, and it's entirely my fault.

322
00:18:28,556 --> 00:18:29,503
Don't you see?

323
00:18:29,642 --> 00:18:31,642
I have to stop her and make this right.

324
00:18:31,798 --> 00:18:33,341
So stand aside, Kuroko.

325
00:18:39,734 --> 00:18:40,738
What are you doing?

326
00:18:41,397 --> 00:18:42,206
Misaka...

327
00:18:42,962 --> 00:18:44,432
I want you to stop for a minute.

328
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:46,156
Look around and tell me what you see.

329
00:18:46,794 --> 00:18:48,037
What are you talking about?

330
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,549
I see you, standing there.

331
00:19:06,468 --> 00:19:07,393
I'm sorry.

332
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:10,507
Really.

333
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:12,637
You're right.

334
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:15,783
I was... I was being selfish.

335
00:19:16,453 --> 00:19:19,120
And... I've gone and caused trouble for you all again.

336
00:19:19,307 --> 00:19:20,516
It isn't any trouble.

337
00:19:22,501 --> 00:19:27,706
Really. But I'd rather fight together with you
than worry about you out there all on your own again.

338
00:19:28,078 --> 00:19:30,638
You know. That's what friends are for, isn't it?

339
00:19:31,573 --> 00:19:32,690
Saten's right!

340
00:19:33,101 --> 00:19:35,105
You're not alone. You've got all of us!

341
00:19:41,059 --> 00:19:43,336
Yeah, I know I do.

342
00:19:43,716 --> 00:19:44,805
Thanks, you guys.

343
00:19:46,593 --> 00:19:47,946
You're next, Uiharu.

344
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,485
You'll apologize to Shirai.

345
00:19:50,913 --> 00:19:53,648
Tell her you're sorry for the way
you've been treating her through all this!

346
00:19:53,787 --> 00:19:55,711
Hey, hold on! That's not fair!

347
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:56,773
You, too, Shirai...

348
00:19:57,323 --> 00:19:59,583
Apologize to Uiharu for slapping her!

349
00:20:03,884 --> 00:20:05,676
I'm sorry for how I've behaved.

350
00:20:05,998 --> 00:20:07,417
Yeah, I'm sorry, too.

351
00:20:08,351 --> 00:20:11,404
So? Don't you have something to say to me, as well?

352
00:20:12,255 --> 00:20:14,161
Yes, I do. Thanks, Kongo.

353
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:16,465
Oh, it was nothing, really.

354
00:20:20,827 --> 00:20:25,851
We now have irrefutable evidence that
Therestina Kihara is involved in illegal activities.

355
00:20:26,082 --> 00:20:29,409
We've always suspected there was
something suspicious about her organization.

356
00:20:29,611 --> 00:20:30,527
We're looking into her, too...

357
00:20:30,552 --> 00:20:33,416
We don't have any time to waste.
We need to be doing something!

358
00:20:33,512 --> 00:20:34,890
Can't Antiskill help out?

359
00:20:34,915 --> 00:20:36,927
It isn't that easy for us to get involved.

360
00:20:37,157 --> 00:20:38,848
There are limits to what we can do.

361
00:20:39,387 --> 00:20:42,288
Oh, yeah? What about finding the
strength to overcome your limits?

362
00:20:42,413 --> 00:20:44,181
It's you... from the workshop.

363
00:20:44,527 --> 00:20:48,293
You're the one who said that when you convince
yourself you can't do any more, you're finished.

364
00:20:48,318 --> 00:20:49,998
Well, we can't give up. Not now.

365
00:20:50,023 --> 00:20:51,273
The children need us!

366
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,278
Okay. Give me a little time.

367
00:20:59,033 --> 00:21:02,025
I'm receiving satellite surveillance data from Antiskill.

368
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:07,936
The MAR trailers are on Urban Expressway Five, just
passing the interchange for School District Eighteen.

369
00:21:08,766 --> 00:21:10,136
Urban Expressway Five.

370
00:21:10,415 --> 00:21:12,665
That leads to District Seventeen, doesn't it?

371
00:21:12,795 --> 00:21:14,085
Why District Seventeen?

372
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:15,694
Do they have some reason for heading there?

373
00:21:16,196 --> 00:21:16,974
I think so.

374
00:21:16,999 --> 00:21:19,440
Gensei Kihara had a private lab in that area.

375
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:20,829
Well, let's see.

376
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:25,708
Here. Can you zoom in enough to
see what's behind the trailers?

377
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:26,679
Sure.

378
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:29,649
Dr. Kiyama!

379
00:21:30,231 --> 00:21:32,183
Geez, she's going after them on her own?

380
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:34,057
How can she take this all on herself?

381
00:21:34,082 --> 00:21:35,248
Really, Sissy?

382
00:21:35,324 --> 00:21:38,728
You know it's almost impossible
not to say something sarcastic now.

383
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:41,882
Yeah, it sounds like you've
got a lot in common with Kiyama.

384
00:21:41,907 --> 00:21:43,656
Hey, now. That isn't true.

385
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:46,960
So, is there something I'm supposed to be doing here?

386
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:49,479
Huh? Oh, are you still around?

387
00:21:49,915 --> 00:21:51,395
Here, wash it down with this.

388
00:21:52,538 --> 00:21:54,633
We can't fight on empty stomachs, can we?

389
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,969
Now eat up, everyone!

390
00:21:56,105 --> 00:21:56,668
Right!

391
00:21:57,033 --> 00:21:59,732
Huh? What is this recording?

392
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:18,220
All right, then.

393
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:19,545
Let's get going!

394
00:23:30,801 --> 00:23:32,082
We've got work to do!

395
00:23:32,165 --> 00:23:33,707
We'll defeat Therestina...

396
00:23:33,732 --> 00:23:35,607
find Haru'ue... and Kiyama...

397
00:23:35,632 --> 00:23:36,242
And then...

398
00:23:36,688 --> 00:23:38,354
We'll save the children!
