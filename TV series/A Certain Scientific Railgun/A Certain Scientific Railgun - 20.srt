1
00:00:17,541 --> 00:00:18,921
Was that another earthquake?

2
00:00:19,492 --> 00:00:21,064
There have been a lot of those lately.

3
00:00:36,713 --> 00:00:37,363
Who's there?!

4
00:00:37,792 --> 00:00:40,531
Beware, I am Mitsuko Kongo of Tokiwadai Middle Scho...

5
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,118
I heard there was another earthquake yesterday...

6
00:00:57,771 --> 00:00:59,249
Was your dorm damaged at all?

7
00:00:59,384 --> 00:01:00,457
No, we were fine...

8
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,030
Fortunately my place didn't really shake that much.

9
00:01:03,055 --> 00:01:06,796
Hmm... That's strange, considering
you're in District Seven, and all.

10
00:01:06,827 --> 00:01:07,821
Mr. Daigo...

11
00:01:08,124 --> 00:01:10,465
Can I ask you... why I'm here?

12
00:01:10,592 --> 00:01:12,111
Oh, of course.

13
00:01:12,987 --> 00:01:13,731
Come on in.

14
00:01:16,791 --> 00:01:18,871
A new transfer student is joining us.

15
00:01:19,057 --> 00:01:20,432
I thought you two should meet...

16
00:01:20,583 --> 00:01:22,151
since she's going to be your roommate.

17
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:25,391
I know it's late notice.

18
00:01:25,513 --> 00:01:29,624
But as our school's Judgment officer, we thought
you'd be a good choice to help her get settled.

19
00:01:31,827 --> 00:01:33,863
Oh...! Yes...! I'll do my best!

20
00:01:36,666 --> 00:01:37,583
Thank you!

21
00:01:37,788 --> 00:01:39,059
I'm Erii Haru'ue.

22
00:03:11,766 --> 00:03:14,242
A transfer student from District Nineteen?

23
00:03:14,678 --> 00:03:15,417
That's odd...

24
00:03:15,454 --> 00:03:17,224
In the middle of the term like this?

25
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:22,122
Yeah, usually transfer students join at the start
of the year, or at least the beginning of a term...

26
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:24,041
What's gotten into you, Saten?

27
00:03:24,066 --> 00:03:25,659
You seem really happy about this.

28
00:03:26,576 --> 00:03:29,974
Well, of course I am! She's going
to be Uiharu's roommate, after all...

29
00:03:29,999 --> 00:03:31,682
That means she'll be my friend, too.

30
00:03:31,707 --> 00:03:32,651
Hey, Saten!

31
00:03:36,805 --> 00:03:37,601
So, um...

32
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:39,421
I'd like you to meet Erii Haru'ue...

33
00:03:39,626 --> 00:03:41,374
And Haru'ue, these are my friends.

34
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,249
On the right is Kuroko Shirai...

35
00:03:43,481 --> 00:03:45,244
Next to her is Mikoto Misaka.

36
00:03:45,374 --> 00:03:47,141
They both go to Tokiwadai Middle School...

37
00:03:47,301 --> 00:03:48,516
And that's Ruiko Saten.

38
00:03:48,613 --> 00:03:49,653
She's in our class.

39
00:03:49,782 --> 00:03:50,629
Hello, there...

40
00:03:50,891 --> 00:03:52,949
Uh... if you don't mind me asking...

41
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:55,524
Why's all your stuff just sitting out here?

42
00:03:55,742 --> 00:03:56,492
Oh, yeah...

43
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:57,740
You see...

44
00:03:57,907 --> 00:04:00,240
I was at the train station picking up Haru'ue

45
00:04:00,265 --> 00:04:03,696
when we got the call that the movers
were already here with all of her things.

46
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:07,409
It wasn't very considerate of the
movers to just drop these here and go.

47
00:04:07,444 --> 00:04:09,371
Well, we can't leave it all sitting here.

48
00:04:09,584 --> 00:04:11,501
I can take care of that simply enough.

49
00:04:14,703 --> 00:04:17,110
Oh! Why didn't I think of that?

50
00:04:19,168 --> 00:04:20,359
Amazing.

51
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,782
I've never seen teleporting before.

52
00:04:22,934 --> 00:04:24,570
That doesn't surprise me a bit...

53
00:04:24,804 --> 00:04:25,849
Not to sound immodest,

54
00:04:25,874 --> 00:04:29,999
but there aren't many teleporters with my
level of power, even within Academy City.

55
00:04:31,661 --> 00:04:32,780
Okay, okay...!

56
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:35,043
Now... shall we get this all put away?

57
00:04:35,265 --> 00:04:35,971
Yeah!

58
00:04:43,888 --> 00:04:45,174
That's the last of it, huh?

59
00:04:46,507 --> 00:04:47,541
Thank you all...

60
00:04:47,599 --> 00:04:49,754
I really appreciate you helping me.

61
00:04:49,779 --> 00:04:51,374
It's no big deal, really...

62
00:04:51,515 --> 00:04:52,394
So anyway...

63
00:04:52,499 --> 00:04:54,276
we finished sooner than expected...

64
00:04:54,301 --> 00:04:55,523
Let's have some fun, huh?

65
00:04:55,548 --> 00:04:56,293
Agreed!

66
00:04:56,723 --> 00:04:58,676
Don't get too excited, Uiharu...

67
00:04:58,701 --> 00:05:00,370
Geez, have you already forgotten?

68
00:05:00,395 --> 00:05:02,626
We have that joint conference to attend today.

69
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:05,177
What conference?

70
00:05:05,397 --> 00:05:07,997
Judgment and Antiskill are meeting this afternoon.

71
00:05:08,124 --> 00:05:09,124
Supposedly...

72
00:05:09,262 --> 00:05:12,624
it has to do with all the earthquakes
we've been experiencing recently.

73
00:05:12,675 --> 00:05:14,305
A conference on earthquakes?

74
00:05:15,218 --> 00:05:16,749
Yeah. We have to go.

75
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:20,000
Well... Misaka and I can still show Haru'ue around.

76
00:05:20,025 --> 00:05:21,541
Without me? No fair!

77
00:05:21,718 --> 00:05:22,786
It'll be fine.

78
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:24,539
They can meet up with us later, right?

79
00:05:26,158 --> 00:05:27,304
It'll be okay...

80
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:29,996
Saten can be a bit too much to handle sometimes,

81
00:05:30,021 --> 00:05:32,916
but Misaka's nice... and we'll
join you as soon as we're finished.

82
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:34,582
Too much to handle?

83
00:05:34,648 --> 00:05:36,745
Saten, I want you to promise me something...

84
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:40,435
Swear you won't flip up Haru'ue's
skirt, even as a joke, okay?

85
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:43,391
Huh? But why would I do something like that?

86
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:44,615
Well, uh...

87
00:05:45,029 --> 00:05:45,489
you...

88
00:05:46,102 --> 00:05:46,951
you know...

89
00:05:48,774 --> 00:05:50,982
All right...! Where should we go now?

90
00:05:51,264 --> 00:05:52,041
Your choice...

91
00:05:52,194 --> 00:05:53,766
Anything special you want to do?

92
00:05:53,829 --> 00:05:54,926
Oh, well, um...

93
00:05:55,491 --> 00:05:57,866
I don't know this district well enough to say.

94
00:05:58,162 --> 00:05:59,646
Oh... of course.

95
00:06:00,089 --> 00:06:01,546
Hey... I know!

96
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:08,108
This spot's becoming the place where friendships begin!

97
00:06:08,497 --> 00:06:09,338
It is, huh...?

98
00:06:09,496 --> 00:06:12,168
This is where we came when I first met you and Uiharu.

99
00:06:12,915 --> 00:06:13,527
It's good?

100
00:06:15,987 --> 00:06:17,141
You've got a little bit on your face, though.

101
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:19,544
Still... it's too bad the others couldn't come...

102
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:24,566
Why would Judgment and Antiskill be holding a
joint conference about something like earthquakes?

103
00:06:24,957 --> 00:06:27,057
It'd make more sense if it was a case.

104
00:06:27,164 --> 00:06:29,754
Heh, heh... I didn't really want to get into it earlier...

105
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:32,225
but there's a hot rumor going around about that.

106
00:06:33,315 --> 00:06:37,232
There is one thing we know for certain
about the recent spate of tremors in the city.

107
00:06:37,556 --> 00:06:39,082
Despite what many people think...

108
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,874
they are not earthquakes.

109
00:06:41,259 --> 00:06:42,378
To be precise...

110
00:06:42,904 --> 00:06:44,432
Poltergeists? You're kidding me.

111
00:06:44,637 --> 00:06:46,533
No! I really think this is true!

112
00:06:46,558 --> 00:06:48,052
What are we talking about here?

113
00:06:48,294 --> 00:06:50,316
Furniture moving around on its own, and stuff?

114
00:06:50,341 --> 00:06:52,165
No P-waves or S-waves were observed!

115
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,788
It's a paranormal phenomenon,

116
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:55,845
I'm telling you! Paranormal!

117
00:06:56,091 --> 00:06:59,477
No doubt the rumor mill is already
churning with all sorts of absurd ideas,

118
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:01,272
so let me make this perfectly clear.

119
00:07:01,749 --> 00:07:03,926
This is not a paranormal phenomenon.

120
00:07:04,394 --> 00:07:09,207
The cause of poltergeisting is simultaneous,
multiple incidents of RSPK Syndrome.

121
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:11,801
What does she mean? What is RSPK Syndrome?

122
00:07:11,907 --> 00:07:13,063
We're about to find out.

123
00:07:13,252 --> 00:07:15,266
At this point, I am going to turn the floor over to

124
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:19,029
Miss Terrestina of the Multi-Active
Rescue Team, who'll explain further.

125
00:07:23,141 --> 00:07:26,641
Hello! As Miss Yomikawa has informed you.

126
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:30,199
My name is Terrestina and I am
with the Multi-Active Rescue Team

127
00:07:30,608 --> 00:07:36,507
RSPK Syndrome refers to the state or phenomenon that
occurs when an Esper temporarily loses their autonomy,

128
00:07:36,674 --> 00:07:39,493
causing their abilities to
unconsciously run out of control.

129
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:42,291
The phenomenon varies according to the Esper.

130
00:07:42,435 --> 00:07:44,133
Please look at the display if you will.

131
00:07:44,652 --> 00:07:49,347
When these phenomena occur simultaneously,
the runaway abilities can merge with each other,

132
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:52,262
and manifest as a uniform poltergeist phenomenon.

133
00:07:52,582 --> 00:07:56,219
As the poltergeisting gains in
strength and spreads over a wide area,

134
00:07:56,474 --> 00:08:00,508
the resulting occurrence can be virtually
indistinguishable from the effects of an earthquake.

135
00:08:01,876 --> 00:08:05,244
The recent tremors we've experienced
are the result of this poltergeisting.

136
00:08:05,744 --> 00:08:10,796
We're still investigating the cause of the
multiple RSPK Syndrome incidents that are responsible.

137
00:08:11,028 --> 00:08:15,652
Unfortunately, there are sure to be a few students
who will believe this is some sort of occult power.

138
00:08:15,732 --> 00:08:17,813
It's a pulse from an alternate dimension!

139
00:08:18,146 --> 00:08:19,332
Or another planet!

140
00:08:19,431 --> 00:08:23,766
Oh! Or maybe the result of secret underground
experiments conducted by the government!

141
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:24,899
In any case...

142
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:30,134
Belief in such nonsense could lead to mass hysteria...
which would only increase the number of casualties.

143
00:08:30,756 --> 00:08:33,462
That is why we have asked
Judgment to attend this conference...

144
00:08:33,487 --> 00:08:37,691
We want you to take measures to ensure that
students are not spreading inflammatory rumors.

145
00:08:37,999 --> 00:08:40,138
Try to put a stop to them before they start.

146
00:08:40,757 --> 00:08:44,358
They say we can expect a really
big one to happen before much longer.

147
00:08:45,596 --> 00:08:46,231
You see?

148
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:51,224
Oh, yeah, you're from District Nineteen, right, Haru'ue?

149
00:08:51,249 --> 00:08:53,807
Weren't there several
poltergeisting outbreaks in that area?

150
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:54,789
What was it like?

151
00:08:56,384 --> 00:08:59,936
Hey, you shouldn't be getting so
excited about this kind of thing.

152
00:09:00,141 --> 00:09:01,641
It could be really serious.

153
00:09:05,774 --> 00:09:08,231
Well, that was over a lot sooner than I expected.

154
00:09:08,417 --> 00:09:11,854
It says that Antiskill has an
additional meeting after the joint one.

155
00:09:12,932 --> 00:09:15,341
You look like you have something on your mind, Konori.

156
00:09:15,427 --> 00:09:18,260
Those RSPK Syndrome incidents she was describing...

157
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:19,575
I've never heard of them...

158
00:09:19,932 --> 00:09:21,483
And the way they're handling this...

159
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,341
something about it just doesn't sit right with me.

160
00:09:24,367 --> 00:09:27,043
Why? They have specialists investigating the occurrences.

161
00:09:27,068 --> 00:09:28,522
That's their job, after all...

162
00:09:28,582 --> 00:09:32,349
At any rate, it's not gonna do any
good for us to try and figure it all out.

163
00:09:32,374 --> 00:09:34,098
You're probably right, but even so...

164
00:09:34,131 --> 00:09:35,548
Hey! We're done here!

165
00:09:35,647 --> 00:09:36,689
Where are you guys now?

166
00:09:41,611 --> 00:09:42,754
All right, Haru'ue.

167
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:45,399
What game would you like to try out next?

168
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,448
Oh...! I know, over here!

169
00:09:48,102 --> 00:09:50,220
Uiharu sure is in rare form, huh?

170
00:09:50,283 --> 00:09:51,220
It looks like you are, too, Sissy

171
00:09:51,245 --> 00:09:52,641
Oh, no... No, these are...

172
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:55,004
You know, something about those
coins looks familiar to me...

173
00:09:59,998 --> 00:10:01,636
Oh... You're playing whack-a-mole?

174
00:10:01,832 --> 00:10:03,666
Yeah... Well, sort of anyway.

175
00:10:03,808 --> 00:10:05,391
I played that when I was younger.

176
00:10:05,537 --> 00:10:06,497
It's so fun.

177
00:10:06,724 --> 00:10:08,953
I've never seen anything like it before.

178
00:10:09,326 --> 00:10:12,130
Look at them popping up like that. So cute!

179
00:10:13,897 --> 00:10:15,333
Yes... very cute...

180
00:10:15,413 --> 00:10:16,207
But, you know...

181
00:10:16,425 --> 00:10:18,829
You might try hitting them, instead of just staring.

182
00:10:20,228 --> 00:10:21,284
Hit the moles?

183
00:10:24,186 --> 00:10:25,416
But that's cruel.

184
00:10:26,471 --> 00:10:27,774
Oh... I guess you're right.

185
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:28,832
Uh... okay!

186
00:10:28,857 --> 00:10:31,248
You can play the game any way you want to.

187
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:33,146
One more time.

188
00:10:33,249 --> 00:10:35,441
Um... that'll be the fourth time in a row...

189
00:10:35,466 --> 00:10:37,689
Hey... you guys, why don't we check that out?

190
00:10:39,469 --> 00:10:40,311
What is it?

191
00:10:41,615 --> 00:10:42,757
Say "cheese!"

192
00:10:42,782 --> 00:10:43,576
Cheese!

193
00:10:48,725 --> 00:10:49,663
Let's see...

194
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,085
Sending...

195
00:10:54,835 --> 00:10:55,510
There we go!

196
00:10:56,115 --> 00:10:56,615
Here.

197
00:10:59,953 --> 00:11:01,446
How should I put this?

198
00:11:01,924 --> 00:11:03,549
The girl is a curiosity.

199
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:05,608
Really? She seems sweet.

200
00:11:06,008 --> 00:11:09,169
Actually, she reminds me of how Uiharu used to be.

201
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:11,328
What do you mean?

202
00:11:12,082 --> 00:11:14,682
You know... back when she'd first transferred in.

203
00:11:15,727 --> 00:11:16,889
Where are you going?

204
00:11:18,378 --> 00:11:18,918
Look out!

205
00:11:20,037 --> 00:11:22,277
Oh, dear... You ran right into it.

206
00:11:22,508 --> 00:11:23,216
You okay?

207
00:11:24,788 --> 00:11:25,915
Up there.

208
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,505
That poster?

209
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:29,268
The one for the fireworks show?

210
00:11:29,931 --> 00:11:32,890
Oh... yeah, that's supposed to be tonight, isn't it?

211
00:11:32,915 --> 00:11:33,789
Yeah, it is.

212
00:11:33,814 --> 00:11:35,038
Hey, we should all go together.

213
00:11:35,063 --> 00:11:36,102
That's a great idea!

214
00:11:36,127 --> 00:11:37,422
We can dress up and everything!

215
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:38,565
Well, what do you say?

216
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:40,275
This is gonna be great!

217
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:42,457
Yeah!

218
00:11:46,185 --> 00:11:48,942
I never worn one of these. It feels strange.

219
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:51,062
Me too, I know what you mean.

220
00:11:51,832 --> 00:11:53,255
Isn't it a little long?

221
00:11:53,827 --> 00:11:55,432
I'm looking up how to wear them.

222
00:11:55,948 --> 00:11:58,141
Oh, here, I think I found something!

223
00:11:58,346 --> 00:12:00,095
Use the sash to adjust the length...

224
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:01,430
Sounds easy enough.

225
00:12:02,414 --> 00:12:04,218
It looks pretty complicated.

226
00:12:04,784 --> 00:12:06,324
Well... we can give it a try!

227
00:12:08,882 --> 00:12:09,652
Let's see here...

228
00:12:10,424 --> 00:12:12,355
First, we pair up the front, like so...

229
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:15,635
Ah... What a beautiful pendant!

230
00:12:17,582 --> 00:12:18,566
It's special...

231
00:12:18,921 --> 00:12:20,664
It's kind of a good luck charm.

232
00:12:20,689 --> 00:12:21,889
A good luck charm, huh?

233
00:12:22,008 --> 00:12:22,913
How nice.

234
00:12:24,552 --> 00:12:27,045
Now... let's see if we can get this to fit right.

235
00:12:28,095 --> 00:12:30,899
Okay... so what's the next step in the process?

236
00:12:31,288 --> 00:12:36,025
"After you pair up the front, you should raise the
garment's collar approximately twenty centimeters..."

237
00:12:36,849 --> 00:12:38,393
I wanted to thank you.

238
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:39,147
Huh?

239
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,749
I mean it...

240
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:42,332
You've helped me so much...

241
00:12:42,485 --> 00:12:44,295
I can tell that you're a good person.

242
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,163
Oh... it's nothing...

243
00:12:46,377 --> 00:12:48,848
As a Judgment officer, I'm happy to help you...

244
00:12:49,332 --> 00:12:52,707
Really, I'm having a lot more fun with
this than with my other duties lately...

245
00:12:52,732 --> 00:12:55,046
Sweeping up, looking for stuff people have lost...

246
00:12:55,427 --> 00:12:56,451
Oh, I see.

247
00:12:56,795 --> 00:13:00,541
Anyway... I'm happy to do anything
I can to help you feel at home...

248
00:13:00,671 --> 00:13:02,671
So... you can always count on me!

249
00:13:05,141 --> 00:13:08,957
Oh... I'm starting to understand why
you needed me to come over so urgently.

250
00:13:08,982 --> 00:13:10,214
Don't just stand there!

251
00:13:10,239 --> 00:13:11,556
Help us out of this thing!

252
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:13,606
There!

253
00:13:14,368 --> 00:13:15,210
That should do it.

254
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:17,141
It's perfect. Thank you.

255
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:20,249
That was amazing, Saten...

256
00:13:20,565 --> 00:13:22,557
You made it look perfect in no time at all!

257
00:13:22,653 --> 00:13:23,582
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

258
00:13:23,838 --> 00:13:25,602
We're gonna be late. Let's hurry up.

259
00:13:26,332 --> 00:13:27,819
I made a mess of things.

260
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:31,108
If I'd known how good you were at
this, I would've asked before we started.

261
00:13:31,344 --> 00:13:33,291
Come on now, you're doing just fine.

262
00:13:35,932 --> 00:13:38,480
Well, I figure it should be my turn to help out this time.

263
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:39,536
How so?

264
00:13:39,832 --> 00:13:43,691
Do you remember how difficult it was
for me to pass all those Judgment tests...

265
00:13:44,393 --> 00:13:47,538
and how that, in turn, made me
insecure about other stuff, too?

266
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:49,422
Yeah, I do...

267
00:13:49,549 --> 00:13:51,207
You were in quite a state, huh?

268
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:53,188
Constantly getting down on yourself.

269
00:13:54,183 --> 00:13:56,516
But fortunately, I didn't have to do it all alone.

270
00:13:56,674 --> 00:13:58,032
You kept encouraging me.

271
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:00,813
You and the others were there for me when I needed help.

272
00:14:00,948 --> 00:14:02,919
Oh, yeah? And we were helpful?

273
00:14:03,318 --> 00:14:04,056
Yes.

274
00:14:05,182 --> 00:14:06,828
It was all thanks to you guys.

275
00:14:07,332 --> 00:14:08,878
I finally passed the tests...!

276
00:14:09,886 --> 00:14:10,881
And that's why...

277
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:15,957
I think it's my turn now... to help
Haru'ue the same way that you guys helped me.

278
00:14:18,126 --> 00:14:19,641
Oh... I mean...

279
00:14:19,802 --> 00:14:22,217
it's not that I'm the only one you should turn to...

280
00:14:23,905 --> 00:14:27,196
I'm really glad that I have you for a roommate, Uiharu.

281
00:14:27,516 --> 00:14:28,481
I trust you!

282
00:14:29,444 --> 00:14:30,992
Oh... good!

283
00:14:31,182 --> 00:14:32,042
Look at you...!

284
00:14:32,305 --> 00:14:34,679
Being recognized for your good deeds at last...

285
00:14:34,822 --> 00:14:35,839
I am so proud!

286
00:14:35,864 --> 00:14:39,307
Geez! You make it sound as though
I'm a little kid or something.

287
00:14:39,376 --> 00:14:40,315
My kid sister!

288
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:41,551
I'm older than you!

289
00:14:41,576 --> 00:14:42,688
Now, stop fidgeting.

290
00:14:42,713 --> 00:14:44,200
We need to get you dressed, don't we?

291
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:54,939
Ready? Let's go.

292
00:15:04,243 --> 00:15:04,790
Whew!

293
00:15:06,343 --> 00:15:08,593
Surely we're safe after that, don't you think?

294
00:15:10,822 --> 00:15:12,045
Escape successful!

295
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:12,936
We're on our way!

296
00:15:14,222 --> 00:15:16,248
Could our dorm be any more of a drag?

297
00:15:17,183 --> 00:15:20,061
They won't even change our curfew for a fireworks show?

298
00:15:20,466 --> 00:15:24,231
Quit fidgeting. Your outfit will be
down around your ankles if you continue.

299
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,249
Yeah, okay.

300
00:15:25,332 --> 00:15:29,757
Although... I guess it doesn't really matter,
since you're still wearing those stupid shorts under it.

301
00:15:29,783 --> 00:15:30,824
What's the big deal?

302
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:32,457
Nobody is gonna see them.

303
00:15:32,482 --> 00:15:34,398
I don't have to see them, but that doesn't change the fact

304
00:15:34,423 --> 00:15:35,833
that I know you have them on.

305
00:15:35,858 --> 00:15:38,486
Anyway... Is Konori coming with us tonight?

306
00:15:38,957 --> 00:15:42,707
Well, she said she wanted to start
investigating these poltergeisting incidents...

307
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:45,929
Something's been nagging at her ever
since the conference this afternoon.

308
00:15:46,874 --> 00:15:49,307
Hmm... You have to admit, it is weird...

309
00:15:49,536 --> 00:15:52,416
All these events occurring, almost
as if they've been coordinated.

310
00:15:56,282 --> 00:15:58,374
Man, this is taking me forever.

311
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:01,906
I don't know if the net's ever
seemed more full of useless information.

312
00:16:02,921 --> 00:16:06,173
Wow! Misaka, you look fantastic!

313
00:16:06,388 --> 00:16:08,589
You, too, Shirai. You're both adorable!

314
00:16:08,749 --> 00:16:10,200
Would you expect any less?

315
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:12,402
And you guys look wonderful, as well.

316
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:16,294
Uh... thank you... We did try.

317
00:16:16,319 --> 00:16:18,422
Ah! All those stands!

318
00:16:18,447 --> 00:16:19,155
You're right!

319
00:16:19,632 --> 00:16:21,046
There sure are a lot.

320
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:23,041
Mmm, it smells so good!

321
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:23,970
I'm going!

322
00:16:24,287 --> 00:16:25,160
Me too!

323
00:16:25,354 --> 00:16:27,289
Sissy, be careful running down that hill!

324
00:16:28,768 --> 00:16:29,522
What do you think?

325
00:16:29,742 --> 00:16:30,682
Should we go?

326
00:16:30,978 --> 00:16:31,962
Yes, please!

327
00:16:59,542 --> 00:17:01,682
Come on, Sissy. You look ridiculous.

328
00:17:01,707 --> 00:17:03,394
Hey,... What's the big deal?

329
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,807
It's a festival, right?

330
00:17:04,832 --> 00:17:06,612
I'm just getting into the spirit.

331
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,096
Honestly!

332
00:17:09,057 --> 00:17:11,448
Huh? What are those trucks for?

333
00:17:11,598 --> 00:17:14,674
MAR. They're with the Multi Active Rescue Team.

334
00:17:16,018 --> 00:17:18,724
They must be a countermeasure for all the poltergeisting.

335
00:17:18,814 --> 00:17:19,916
Poltergeisting?!

336
00:17:19,941 --> 00:17:21,589
Then... all the rumors are true?

337
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:26,211
It would be a real mess if one of those
incidents happened here with all these people around.

338
00:17:26,444 --> 00:17:28,438
It's not that I don't get why they're here...

339
00:17:28,808 --> 00:17:30,821
but it's a shame on a night like tonight...

340
00:17:31,224 --> 00:17:33,513
They don't exactly blend in at a festival.

341
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,142
Oh...! Just a second.

342
00:17:35,325 --> 00:17:37,082
I know the perfect place to go!

343
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:45,214
Nice, huh? We've got a great view here.

344
00:17:45,354 --> 00:17:46,124
Hey, look, you guys!

345
00:17:46,207 --> 00:17:47,666
There's another round going.

346
00:17:51,214 --> 00:17:54,187
You can kind of feel the "boom" in your tummy, can't you?

347
00:17:55,242 --> 00:17:55,758
Yeah...

348
00:17:56,066 --> 00:17:57,394
Like... like an echo.

349
00:18:03,805 --> 00:18:05,110
It's so pretty.

350
00:18:10,009 --> 00:18:12,124
Maybe I should have gone to the festival.

351
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:15,199
It still feels like something's wrong.

352
00:18:15,434 --> 00:18:17,111
But I'm not making any headway.

353
00:18:19,075 --> 00:18:19,783
What's this?

354
00:18:21,249 --> 00:18:23,082
AIM diffusion fields?

355
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:28,800
What a great show!

356
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:30,977
Woo... hoo!

357
00:18:31,192 --> 00:18:32,291
Here they come!

358
00:18:32,456 --> 00:18:34,824
Light up the sky!!

359
00:18:36,909 --> 00:18:38,064
Is something the matter?

360
00:18:41,605 --> 00:18:43,292
I was just remembering.

361
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,375
Remembering what?

362
00:18:47,655 --> 00:18:48,822
More like "who".

363
00:18:49,266 --> 00:18:51,474
You see... I had a friend once...

364
00:18:51,641 --> 00:18:54,413
We were super close, just like the two of you are.

365
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:58,586
Are you okay?

366
00:18:58,978 --> 00:19:00,126
Something wrong?

367
00:19:02,914 --> 00:19:03,724
Where's she going?

368
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:04,710
Haru'ue!

369
00:19:05,059 --> 00:19:05,964
Hold on a sec!

370
00:19:06,863 --> 00:19:08,975
Huh? I wonder where they're going.

371
00:19:11,132 --> 00:19:14,391
Finally! They're taking the hint
and giving us time alone together!

372
00:19:14,474 --> 00:19:17,667
Now we can imitate the fireworks and
let our bodies glow with passionate fire!

373
00:19:17,692 --> 00:19:19,938
Let go! I don't feel like fighting you.

374
00:19:19,963 --> 00:19:21,315
It's too hot out here!

375
00:19:21,567 --> 00:19:24,270
As hot as the flame that burns in my heart for you!

376
00:19:24,424 --> 00:19:26,200
Huh? Who could it be?

377
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:29,995
Hi, Konori. What are you doing, calling me at this hour?

378
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,967
Listen! It's about the poltergeist incidents!

379
00:19:32,918 --> 00:19:37,337
I know that doing research is important, but
would it hurt you to take a breather once in a while?

380
00:19:37,637 --> 00:19:39,374
The fireworks show is beautiful.

381
00:19:39,399 --> 00:19:40,886
Just listen to me, will you?!

382
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:44,562
I've found a possible cause
for the RSPK Syndrome activity.

383
00:19:44,737 --> 00:19:48,176
Intentional outside interference
with AIM diffusion fields.

384
00:19:48,663 --> 00:19:50,154
AIM diffusion fields.

385
00:19:50,179 --> 00:19:51,340
So, what are you saying?

386
00:19:52,267 --> 00:19:55,897
That all of this poltergeisting
lately isn't just some random accident!

387
00:19:56,542 --> 00:19:57,489
Where are you?

388
00:19:58,225 --> 00:19:59,212
Where have you gone?

389
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:01,670
Haru'ue... what's wrong?

390
00:20:02,557 --> 00:20:03,540
Where are you?

391
00:20:04,307 --> 00:20:07,371
You're saying there's actually
somebody orchestrating these events?

392
00:20:11,584 --> 00:20:12,346
What was that?

393
00:20:12,727 --> 00:20:13,807
Shirai, hello?

394
00:20:14,108 --> 00:20:14,791
Is this?!

395
00:20:15,219 --> 00:20:16,211
I think so.

396
00:20:16,729 --> 00:20:18,070
It's poltergeisting!

397
00:20:20,845 --> 00:20:21,758
I've got you!

398
00:20:25,994 --> 00:20:27,391
What about the other three?

399
00:20:27,988 --> 00:20:28,835
Uiharu!

400
00:20:31,499 --> 00:20:32,496
Uiharu!

401
00:20:46,978 --> 00:20:48,395
Saten, are you all right?

402
00:21:00,806 --> 00:21:02,018
That was a close call.

403
00:21:04,734 --> 00:21:05,542
Are you injured...?

404
00:21:07,026 --> 00:21:08,062
You're safe now.

405
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:10,040
I know that lady!

406
00:21:15,815 --> 00:21:17,649
Haru'ue! Can you hear me?

407
00:21:20,075 --> 00:21:21,053
Good, you're awake...

408
00:21:21,275 --> 00:21:22,418
Are you okay?

409
00:21:22,826 --> 00:21:24,151
That was quite a fall.

410
00:21:25,288 --> 00:21:25,955
Where?

411
00:21:28,304 --> 00:21:29,272
Where are you?

412
00:21:29,612 --> 00:21:30,626
Please, where?

413
00:21:33,024 --> 00:21:34,477
I don't understand.

414
00:21:40,918 --> 00:21:42,876
Wow, that's amazing!

415
00:21:46,741 --> 00:21:47,907
Something's collapsed.

416
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:49,479
Was there an accident?

417
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:31,806
Where are you?

418
00:23:32,092 --> 00:23:33,220
Where did you go?

419
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:34,516
This direction, Haru'ue...

420
00:23:34,715 --> 00:23:37,435
No! No! Not that way! Over here!

421
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:39,087
It's the blind leading the blind.
