00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.751  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
it looks as though there are multiple IBMs

[Ogura] There is no precedent

00:06:53.946 --> 00:06:57.583  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It's a phenomenon
that happens extremely rarely,
