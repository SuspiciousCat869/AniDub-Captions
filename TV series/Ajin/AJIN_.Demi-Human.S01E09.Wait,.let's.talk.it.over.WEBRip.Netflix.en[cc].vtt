00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:40.279  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:14:40.346 --> 00:14:42.281  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:14:42.448 --> 00:14:45.484  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:14:52.057 --> 00:14:55.427  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

He was sympathetic to Ajins.

00:14:59.265 --> 00:15:01.233  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And he's also part of the government.

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:03.669  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:15:04.103 --> 00:15:07.940  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
So, it was worth dying to save him.
Any more questions?

00:15:53.519 --> 00:15:57.222  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Now then, as I've said many times already,

00:15:57.289 --> 00:16:02.294  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
there's absolutely no truth to the rumor

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:24.249  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It must be because something awful

00:16:24.316 --> 00:16:27.386  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%
