"it's lonely at the top."

And the fact that I selected
you just confirms my genius.

I'm not letting up until I've
seen how far we can take this.

Ha, ha!

You've abandoned the world
of your former height,

well say goodbye.

Whoa! I'm looking at me!

Your eyes are incredible.

I've never pulled a stunt
this labor-intensive before,

it'll take to reach my limit.

[LI GADO]
Hm? Your limit?

Doing this generates heat.

185

Too much strain and my eyes
start roasting in my sockets.

[LI GADO] Then we'll do this

[GEMNEMO] This is beginning
to get tedious.

193
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:51,000
There's really no point in
acting all sanctimonious now.

[GEMNEMO]
Huh?

196
00:12:57,375 --> 00:13:00,708
[LI GADO] Gemnemo's a textbook
megalomaniacal control freak.

197
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:02,833
There's no doubt he's inside
where he can continue

198
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:04,958
to manipulate Riel.

Oh! Go up to the left

[LI GADO]
If he's in there like I suspect,

202
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:26,333
he'll be positioned
somewhere on the brainstem.

203
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:36,208
[K.K.] Feels like he's been
standing there forever.

204
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:38,041
Think he'll ever move?

205
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:40,250
You should probably
keep further back.

206
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:44,333
You've at least got the luxury
of attacking from a distance.

[K.K.] As big as that thing is,
anywhere is close to it.

These sonic speed monkeys

Don't worry about me.

Wait, what are you doing?

[GEMNEMO] I tried asking nicely,

Chain inconvenienced you,

316
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:35,083
considering you were in the
hospital the entire time.

317
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:37,166
And with the three different
harassment complaints

318
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:40,208
the nurses filed on you, there's
a paper trail to prove it.

319
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:40,833
[ZAPP gasps]

320
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:41,500
[thud]

321
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:42,500
[LEO]
Ow!

322
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:44,666
[ZAPP laughing]

323
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,291
Oh, you, joker, you!

324
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:48,958
However do you come up with
all these funny stories?

325
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:52,750
--[LEO] Please, stop!
--[ZAPP laughing]

326
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:04,625
[LEO] It's been five
days now since Riel

327
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:07,083
tumbled into the Eternal Hollow.

328
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:08,750
At the moment he fell,

329
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:11,500
everyone braced
themselves for the impact.

330
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:13,083
But that giant hole,

331
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:15,625
it just swallowed him up
without a sound.

332
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:19,333
[LI GADO] And that's all there
is to it. Problem solved!

333
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:21,333
[LEO grumbles]

334
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:24,000
[LEO] Li Gado's convinced his
procedure-reversal program

335
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:26,541
successfully reverted Riel.

336
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:33,791
[LEO] But still, I'm really
not sure what to think.

337
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:37,583
Actually, I'm just
not sure how I feel.

338
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:44,083
[LEO]
It's just...

339
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:47,916
If Riel is actually alive
at the bottom of that hole,

340
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,458
I can't help but
worry about him.

341
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:56,500
[LEO]
And how lonely he must feel.

342
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:07,500
[LEO, RIEL laughing]

343
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:20,708
[grunting]

344
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:27,041
Hey, Leo, good to see ya.

345
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:30,083
What the hell?!

346
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,750
[LEO]
Oh! That's it!

347
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:36,416
Let's talk to Dr. Li Gado.
I bet he can help.

348
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,916
[RIEL]
I'm okay, Leo.

349
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
[LEO]
Huh?

350
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:41,291
After the havoc I
managed to cause,

351
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:44,375
I'm wholly comfortable accepting
this as my true height.

352
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:45,500
[LEO]
Are you sure?

353
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:46,916
Believe me.

354
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,166
The view from down here?

355
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:52,166
It really puts the
world in perspective.

356
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:55,125
Hey, y'know what, Riel?

357
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:56,958
I think you've grown.

358
00:21:57,041 --> 00:21:58,208
[chuckles]

359
00:21:58,291 --> 00:22:00,666
Yeah, I guess I have.

360
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:05,708
[LEO]
Ah! Riel!

361
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,625
[RIEL laughs]

362
00:23:35,708 --> 00:23:36,833
[KLAUS]
Hmm.

363
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:39,375
Hey, Steven. Has Zapp
been in yet today?

364
00:23:39,458 --> 00:23:41,000
He's at Central Hospital.

365
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:42,458
Not again.

366
00:23:42,541 --> 00:23:44,416
Doesn't sound like a pretty
sight when they found him.

367
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,666
His face was swollen
three times its size

368
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:49,000
and there were five sets
of handprints on him.

369
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:51,875
[LI GADO] And that's all there
is to it. Problem solved!

370
00:23:51,958 --> 00:23:54,333
[LEO grumbles]

371
00:23:54,416 --> 00:23:56,625
[K.K.] Children know not
their parents' hearts,

372
00:23:56,708 --> 00:23:58,625
and parents know not
their children's.

373
00:23:58,708 --> 00:24:01,291
And there's a good chance
they might not mesh.

374
00:24:01,375 --> 00:24:03,333
In the end, there's
one thing for certain.

375
00:24:03,416 --> 00:24:06,333
Nobody is ever loved the
way they truly want to be.

376
00:24:06,416 --> 00:24:08,208
It's tough having kids.
