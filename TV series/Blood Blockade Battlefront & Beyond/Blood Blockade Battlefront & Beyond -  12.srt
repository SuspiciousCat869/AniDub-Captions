1
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:21,000
[GAMIMOZU]
The rubberneckers sure did

2
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:22,916
come out in droves
for the chaos.

3
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,166
[LEO] We won't be able to
get a cab in this crowd.

4
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,541
[GAMIMOZU]
A minor setback.

5
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:29,083
We'll just have to walk a bit.

6
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:31,458
Oh, and I'm sure this
goes without saying.

7
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:33,000
[LEO]
Go on and say it.

8
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:35,000
[GAMIMOZU] Don't even think
about losing me in this crowd.

9
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:37,083
I can assure you with
absolute certainty

10
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:39,833
that such an act will not work
out the way you want it to.

11
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:41,000
[LEO]
Of course not.

12
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:43,458
I'm not gonna leave
my sister with you.

13
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:45,125
[GAMIMOZU]
That's a smart lad.

14
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:47,291
You would regret that.

15
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:51,666
Nice day, huh?

16
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,583
Huh? What? Sorry.

17
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:55,083
Jeez, Leo.

18
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:57,375
Conversations work better
when you listen.

19
00:03:57,458 --> 00:03:59,708
[LEO laughs]

20
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:02,833
I'll try to keep that in mind.
You really like this spot.

21
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:04,958
[MICHELLA]
I suppose. What, you don't?

22
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:08,750
[LEO] To be perfectly honest,
I'm a little tired of it.

23
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:13,375
[MICHELLA]
Hey, Leo.

24
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:14,708
[LEO]
Hm?

25
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:16,583
[MICHELLA]
Thanks for this.

26
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:18,875
Even though you're
bored with this place,

27
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:22,666
it means a lot to me that
you always bring me out here.

28
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,625
I'm kind of a spoiled brat, huh?

29
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:25,333
[LEO]
Hm?

30
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:26,875
What makes you say that?

31
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:29,458
[MICHELLA] Well, I practically
disrupt someone's entire day

32
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:32,333
whenever I get the whim
to come out here.

33
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:40,333
[MICHELLA] It's not like I can
come here on my own or anything.

34
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:45,833
I mean, look at me!
I'm not really a hiker.

35
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:47,583
Well, that was dark.

36
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:49,875
[chuckles]

37
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:53,875
[LEO]
Just hang on, Sis.

38
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,291
[GAMIMOZU] They'll be
calling any moment now.

39
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:02,625
Who will?

40
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:05,416
[phone rings]

41
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,750
[LEO]
Klaus?

42
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:12,000
[GAMIMOZU] Go on and answer it.
And be mindful of your words.

43
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:14,958
Hey. What's going on, Klaus?

44
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:18,791
Oh, yeah.
No, sorry about that.

45
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:21,000
You guys looked busy, so...

46
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:23,958
Uh, yeah. I'm fine.

47
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:25,708
Mh-hm.

48
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:28,958
Okay. Later.

49
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:31,541
You knew that they would call.
Are you tapping them?

50
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:34,000
[GAMIMOZU] Of course not,
it was just simple deduction.

51
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,750
You left without a word
after that battle,

52
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:38,750
so it's only natural
they'd check in on you.

53
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:43,291
[GAMIMOZU]
You can get rid of that now.

54
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:46,375
Go on and toss your cellphone
over the railing there.

55
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:51,708
[GAMIMOZU]
No one else should be calling,

56
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:55,166
so it's not like you need it.

57
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,041
Quit thinking.

58
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:59,458
Just go on and throw it.

59
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:15,875
[GAMIMOZU]
Now simply let it drop.

60
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:28,291
[LEO grunts]

61
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:33,583
[GAMIMOZU]
Very good.

62
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:36,000
Now, let's hurry and find a cab.

63
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:47,333
[GAMIMOZU]
Why're you just standing there?

64
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:49,083
[LEO]
Uh, sorry.

65
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:52,166
Let's keep moving.

66
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:59,125
[LEO] He missed that. He didn't
see Sonic back there.

67
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:04,541
[LEO] I've gotta take
a chance and test him.

68
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:07,666
[GAMIMOZU] I have to say, this
is certainly a fascinating city.

69
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,291
In the few short blocks
that we've walked,

70
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:11,583
countless wonders have
emerged from this fog,

71
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:15,333
sights most people live their
whole lives without seeing.

72
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:19,083
You should be grateful for
the gifts this fog offers. Hm?

73
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:27,833
[LEO]
It hurried to close the gap.

74
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:29,208
That settles it.

75
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:32,458
That thing doesn't have the
All-seeing Eyes' powers.

76
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:35,083
And I was convinced
I had no chance here.

77
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:37,750
Thanks for opening
my eyes, Sonic.

78
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:39,041
[sneezes]

79
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:43,958
[GAMIMOZU]
All right then.

80
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:47,291
It should be easy enough
to flag down a cab here.

81
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:48,625
[LEO]
Uh?

82
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:56,416
[GAMIMOZU] Hey, why are you
heading into an alley?

83
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,583
It's a shortcut.

84
00:07:57,666 --> 00:08:00,250
You wanna get there
quickly, don't you?

85
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:01,625
[PUNK A]
Huh?

86
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:07,416
[PUNK B] You picked the
wrong alley, little huma.

87
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,375
Hand over your money, kid.

88
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:11,833
We'll also take one of your
organs while you're at it.

89
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:14,083
We'll let ya pick which one.

90
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:20,208
[GAMIMOZU] I knew it was a
bad idea to take this route.

91
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:23,541
If they try to steal your eyes,
you tell them they're mine.

92
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:29,958
[LEO]
Shuffle!

93
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:33,000
[PUNK B] What the hell?
Get back here, asshole!

94
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:41,666
[PUNK B] Can't see
anything in this damn fog!

95
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:45,125
[yelling]

96
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:47,041
[horn blares]

97
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:52,708
[PUNK B] I'm gonna find ya,
ya shit! Yer freakin' dead!

98
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,166
[GAMIMOZU]
Hey! There you are.

99
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,958
Were you trying to
get yourself killed?

100
00:08:57,041 --> 00:09:00,041
You are not getting out
of this that easily.

101
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:08,833
[STARPHASE]
What's up?

102
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:09,791
[KLAUS]
Hm...

103
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:11,291
What, is it Leo?

104
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:13,416
Did something seem off
when you talked to him?

105
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,333
No. It was a fairly
normal conversation.

106
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:18,458
But something just
doesn't feel right.

107
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:20,791
Sure. I've got
the same feeling.

108
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:22,416
It's definitely not
like him to leave

109
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,916
without even bothering
to say goodbye.

110
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,583
[gasps]

111
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:35,541
What the hell is it?
What's wrong?

112
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:38,083
Everything.
We've got a code red here.

113
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:40,250
Call in every
operative we've got!

114
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:44,875
[horns honking]

115
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:45,916
[KLAUS]
It's no good.

116
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,375
He's not answering.

117
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:49,458
His GPS has gone offline.

118
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:52,250
This is bad.
And it happened so quickly.

119
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:55,375
No, this situation's been
in motion for a while.

120
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:57,625
Huh?

121
00:09:57,708 --> 00:09:58,833
Yeah, it's the text he sent

122
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:02,333
from his Blood Breed
name-input app, right?

123
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:04,000
Is something hidden in the name?

124
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:05,208
[KLAUS]
Below the name.

125
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:08,125
Look how far down the
blank space extends.

126
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,250
[STARPHASE gasps]

127
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:14,500
[KLAUS] Whatever's happening,
it's been silently escalating.

128
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:16,875
This conflict Leo's
embroiled in,

129
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:19,416
it's outside the bounds
of our perception.

130
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:30,833
[GAMIMOZU] And we've arrived
at last. Please, after you.

131
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,166
[LEO gasps]

132
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:41,125
[GAMIMOZU]
Welcome home, Leo.

133
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:44,458
I thought you might enjoy a
little stroll down memory lane.

134
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:45,750
It has been a couple of years

135
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:47,958
since you've been
home to visit, right?

136
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:49,541
How do you know this place?

137
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:52,250
[GAMIMOZU] Oh, it's a very
dear memory for Toby.

138
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:56,333
Such a lovely and romantic
backdrop for a first date.

139
00:10:57,625 --> 00:11:00,208
[MICHELLA] Well, I practically
disrupt someone's entire day

140
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:04,041
whenever I get the whim
to come out here.

141
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:08,125
It's not like I can come here
on my own or anything.

142
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:13,500
[screams]

143
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:19,750
[GAMIMOZU] My, my. Lashing out
in desperation now, are we?

144
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:22,583
You can't hope to match the
power of my All-seeing Eye,

145
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:25,000
so you physically attack me?

146
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:32,625
[LEO]
I thought so.

147
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:35,416
He hides his actions through
visual manipulation,

148
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,750
but the only way
to make that work

149
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:39,416
is for him to be as silent
as he possibly can.

150
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,833
Which means...

151
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,000
[LEO]
...he's extremely light!

152
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:47,625
[GAMIMOZU] You are rather
headstrong, aren't you?

153
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,208
But how quickly
will it take for me

154
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,375
to bleed that strength from you?

155
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:56,958
[GAMIMOZU]
No! Why are they coming back?

156
00:11:57,041 --> 00:12:01,791
He has no way of contacting
them. Coincidence?

157
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:03,250
It can't be.

a design beyond fortuity.

procedure will take 30 minutes.

settle down. Understood?

[GAMIMOZU]
Really?

I just can't seem to hit your

Oh? So that's your game.

You're running your All-seeing

momentarily overwhelm
my abilities.

00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:21,750
But that is a truly
reckless gambit.

181
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:23,125
You're searing your own flesh

182
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:25,375
and you're more than
likely to boil your brain

inside your skull.

184

And yet you choose
to get back up.

You decided this fate for her.

If you had only
obeyed my wishes,

195
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,291
there would be no need for
her involvement in this.

I will only give you
this one final warning.

Submit to my demands and
let me operate on you.

Or would you rather watch me
carve up your sister

00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:07,250
like a medical school cadaver?

the vast importance of this eye.

You deserve to die a thousand

option off of the table.

all you've done.

Of course.

So how is he today? Any changes?

255
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:09,833
[MICHELLA] He'll briefly
wake up from time to time,

256
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:12,208
but then he immediately
falls back asleep.

257
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:13,750
That's only natural,

258

D'you know tortoises
can't move backwards?

261
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:21,791
I think that it
has something to do

with the shape of their shell.

263
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:26,125
I remember when
I first heard that.

264
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:30,041
It immediately made me
think of my big brother.

00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:32,625
Even if his knees lock up
and he can't move,

266
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:37,125
frozen in place with doubt,
he still never runs away.

267
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:39,583
He just hunkers down
and endures it,

268
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:42,083
until he can take
a step forward.

269
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,625
My brother, the Tortoise Knight.

I know you will,

271

She's back at the hotel

278
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:11,458
[LEO]
Oh, thank you.

279
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,833
[KLAUS]
I've been thinking.

280
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:20,291
Do you remember
the day when we met?

281
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:24,166
[KLAUS] One of the first
things you said to me,

282
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,875
you called yourself a coward.

283
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:28,166
It's understandable
you would feel such pain.

284
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,041
It makes my heart ache to think
of the incident you endured,

285
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:33,083
and the dark shadow
it cast over you.

286
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:36,416
However, perhaps you can think
of it this way instead.

287
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,833
If the despair you've suffered

288
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:40,791
has become the foundation
you stand upon,

289
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:44,750
and your profound remorse has
come to serve as your resolve,

290
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:46,833
then the pain inflicted
on you that day,

291
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:49,666
it's made you who you are now.

292
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,875
That strength is what
saved your sister.

293
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:53,958
And all of mankind,
for that matter.

294
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:56,416
That is the absolute
and undeniable truth.

295
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:00,041
Your actions are the exact
opposite of cowardice.

296
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:02,000
You should be proud.

297
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:08,958
I'm glad you're a part of

[LEO]
Whoa, Black! Why are you...?

314
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:55,291
Well, uh, I got to thinking
after we talked the other day

315
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:57,416
and figured it was
time to come visit.

But, y'know,
I stepped off the bus...

00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:01,041
You got mugged?

318
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:02,916
They didn't even leave
me a single penny.

319
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,333
Yup. That's how they do.

320
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:05,916
Thank God for Vivian.

321
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,875
She was kind enough to hire me
so I could get back on my feet.

322
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:18,166
Your timing is excellent.
Jump in and give us a hand.

323
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,583
All three of you.

[ZAPP] We could've been at the
airport, you ugly nutsack!

329
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:32,416
[BLACK]
Well, White.

330
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,541
Seems like Leo's
doing just fine.

331
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:37,291
Guess there was nothing
to worry about after all.

[LEO screams]

333
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:42,000
Hi, boys and girls,
remember me?

334
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:46,625
It's your King of Depravity!
F.E.M.T! Femt!

[FEMT]
I know you missed me,

337
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,833
and I'm sure you missed
my demon beasts even more,

338
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:53,125
so here they are!

339
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:54,458
I did some tinkering
with their recipe

340
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:55,833
and modified their composition,

341
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:58,041
and what do you know, their
metabolisms skyrocketed!

342
00:21:58,125 --> 00:21:59,333
Which means that--

343
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:02,458
Well, I doubt I need to
spell it out for you.

344

[LEO]
Today, tomorrow, the day after.

345
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:09,583
Every day unveils some brand
new unprecedented insanity.

346
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:13,583
And I doubt it's gonna
let up anytime soon.

347
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:17,666
But that's what happens when two
worlds intersect in one city.

348
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:20,750
You get Hellsalem's Lot.

Hello, Michella.

I'm glad you got to
