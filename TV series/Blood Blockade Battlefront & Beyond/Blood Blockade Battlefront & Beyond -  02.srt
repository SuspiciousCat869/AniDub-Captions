00:00:10,833 --> 00:00:12,416
[PARAMEDIC A]
BP's at 90 over 60!

00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,958
Pulse is 140 and erratic!

00:00:15,041 --> 00:00:16,541
[PARAMEDIC B]
Is he cognizant?

4
00:00:16,625 --> 00:00:17,875
They're all packed!

5
00:00:17,958 --> 00:00:20,416
Every single ER in the city
has turned us away!

6
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,708
Well, shit.

7
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:23,000
[LEO] Zapp! Say something!
Please, Zapp!

8
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:24,291
Shut up!

9
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:26,625
Or I'll stick you with
a syringe of Demerol!

10
00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:27,583
[PILOT A]
What the hell?

11
00:00:27,666 --> 00:00:28,750
[PARAMEDIC B]
Huh?

12
00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:32,125
Something wrong?

13
00:00:32,208 --> 00:00:34,375
Aim your eyes
toward one o'clock.

14
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:42,666
What the--? Where the
hell'd that come from?

15
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,458
[KLAUS] The intersection between
two worlds. Hellsalem's Lot.

16
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:55,083
Libra, a secret society of super
humans toiling in the shadows

17
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:58,583
to preserve the fractured
balance between worlds.

18
00:00:58,666 --> 00:01:01,166
These are the records
of our covert missions.

19
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:36,500
[PARAMEDIC B] Well, that
looks like a hospital.

20
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:38,708
[COPILOT A] Yeah,
but I've never seen it before.

21
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:40,833
And it was not there when
we flew past this spot

22
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:42,250
15 minutes ago.

23
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:43,833
Hey, look!

24
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:48,250
[PILOT A] They've already got
an admin team ready to greet us.

25
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:49,250
What do we do here?

26
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:50,500
[ZAPP]
Why do I feel so sleepy?

27
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:51,666
[LEO screams]

00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,291
[ZAPP]
Look at the pretty pasture.

00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:55,208
[PARAMEDIC B]
Take us down!

30
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:56,708
What?!

31
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:59,083
[PARAMEDIC B]
Zap Renfro. Age 24.

32
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:01,416
Fractured femur and
multiple compound fractures

33
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,625
sustained in a head-on collision
with a heavily-armored vehicle.

34
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:06,375
We stopped the bleeding
and he's stable.

35
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:08,291
You guys take it from here!

36
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:10,250
Now I know how it feels
to be abandoned.

37
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:12,375
[LUCIANA]
How unprofessional.

38
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:14,375
I don't think they
liked you very much.

39
00:03:14,458 --> 00:03:15,708
[LEO]
Mm...

40
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:19,625
Not to be rude, but you're
not a doctor, are you?

41
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:20,958
I certainly am.

42
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:22,916
Wait, what? You're not
even old enough to drive!

43
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,291
[LUCIANA]
And your point is?

44
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:25,458
[LEO]
Eh...

45
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:28,333
[ZAPP]
All those moments will be lost.

46
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:32,291
[LEO] Okay, this place
is weirdin' me out!

47
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:36,333
I do not wanna deal with
this crap on my own!

48
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:38,333
Uh, hey, Steven?

49
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:46,291
Wait. Is that what
I think it is?

50
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:48,750
[LEO] All I know is that it's
supposed to be a hospital.

51
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:51,000
Well, that, and it's
staffed by toddlers.

52
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:52,041
[STARPHASE]
Klaus.

53
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:54,291
[KLAUS]
Yes. It's finally returned.

54
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:56,500
Uh. Wait, you know this place?

55
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:59,000
[STARPHASE] We've both been
in this building once before.

56
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:01,875
Three years ago, during the
night of the Great Collapse.

57
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:03,291
[LEO]
Huh?!

58
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:35,000
[STARPHASE]
Seventeen hours since this fog

59
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:36,875
started ripping
the city to hell,

60
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:38,166
and it doesn't
look like the chaos

61
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,333
is gonna let up anytime soon.

62
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:41,416
Christ.

63
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,208
Hm?

64
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:45,583
Pretty sure that
guide's lost its use.

65
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:47,041
In case you haven't noticed,

66
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:49,500
most of the buildings aren't
where they were yesterday.

67
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:52,291
I'm using it to identify
the buildings floating past.

68
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,333
It's helping me to
assess the destruction.

69
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:56,916
That was the GE building
we drove beneath earlier.

70
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,541
Are you really trying to
pinpoint every building we pass?

71
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:02,541
You're treating the apocalypse
like a tourist trap.

72
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:07,541
[STARPHASE] Speaking of, we
should be thinking big picture.

73
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:10,458
Suppose the entire world's
shrouded in this fog.

74
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:13,000
If that's the case, then what?

75
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:15,166
I have no idea.

76
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:18,083
Whatever this is, I'm not sure
if our monster fighting days

77
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:19,875
have prepared us for it.

78
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:21,916
We're talking about
someone or something

79
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,333
that can rearrange New York
like it was made of Lego blocks.

80
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:28,583
I doubt our techniques are
gonna be enough to stop it.

81
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:30,083
Stop the jeep!

82
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:37,625

[KLAUS]
Steven.

84
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,666
Let's try to avoid any premature

85
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,541
and distraught
conclusions, shall we?

86
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:49,916
We need to stay
focused on surviving.

87
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,166
And we'll gather intel as we go.

88
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,500
But the first thing
we need to do...

89
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:59,541
[KLAUS] ...is find a safe
place to take this child.

90
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:01,083
Sounds good.

91
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,333
[KLAUS] That appears to be
Bradbury General Hospital.

92
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:07,791
[STARPHASE] All that's left
is the central building.

93
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:10,833
Hold it!

94
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:14,333
We have an infant.
It needs shelter and food.

Paging Dr. Gunther. Dr. Gunther.

96

[GUNTHER]
Well, now.

97
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:35,791
I'm pretty sure I would remember
admitting a man your size.

98
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:37,208
[KLAUS]
We've only just walked in.

99
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:40,291
[GUNTHER] Really? From that
maelstrom of surreality?

100
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:43,458
[KLAUS] Yes. And we
found this poor child.

101
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:52,125
[GUNTHER] So, can you update me
on what's happening out there?

102
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:53,916
Well, honestly...

103
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,791
[GUNTHER] Still beyond
description then, huh?

104
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,125
[STARPHASE]
Exactly.

105
00:06:58,208 --> 00:06:59,541
[GUNTHER] Well, I guess
that describes it plenty.

106
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:01,041
[NURSE A]
Doctor.

107
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:03,125
It seems the pain is keeping
Mr. Phillips from sleeping.

108
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:04,500
Five cc's morphine.

109
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:06,583
[NURSE A]
Right.

110
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:08,750
[GUNTHER] And don't forget
the laxative and antiemetic.

111
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:10,416
[NURSE A]
Yes, sir.

112
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,791
[GUNTHER] It's been
like this 18 hours now.

113
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:15,541
Not exactly easy
on a man my age.

114
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:19,041
Huh?

115
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:24,083
Hey, wake up, Luciana!

116
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:26,083
Go lie down on a sofa
in the waiting room

117
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:27,500
if you need some sleep.

118
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:29,583
[LUCIANA]
Uh?

119
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:31,041
Oh. Doctor!

120
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:33,750
I'm sorry. Did I
really fall asleep?

121
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:36,250
[GUNTHER]
Sure did. While standing up.

122
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:37,708
[LUCIANA]
Wow, oh my God.

123
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:41,416
Well, I do feel more alert
so I guess it helped some.

124
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,541
[KLAUS] That was some
rather impressive repose.

125
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:46,125
I've seen others fall asleep
on their feet before,

126
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:47,791
but never so gracefully.

127
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:50,708
Well, hello, big guy.
Aren't you a smooth talker?

128
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:54,000
If you caught me any other day,
I'd offer you a physical exam.

129
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:56,166
On the house, of course.

We're all right.

140
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:46,708
[STARPHASE]
Huh.

141
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:48,791
So this guy, do ya think
he speaks English?

142
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:50,416
We know a total
of nine languages,

143
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,375
so we can work our
way down the list.

00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:53,875
You okay there, Klaus?

145
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:56,458
That almost sounded like you
were tryin' to crack a joke.

00:08:56,541 --> 00:09:00,125
Yeah, well, I suppose
I am a little bit anxious.

[KLAUS]
Steven. That's a Blood Breed.

[laughs]

149
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:10,541
I'm just out trying to enjoy
a stroll with my dog,

150
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:13,416
but of course, my shitty luck.

151
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,833

can we not take a break from
the boring old routine?

of something

00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,208
that's always been there.

159
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:35,083
This mist is a world that
exists right next to your own.

160
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:38,666
It's just that sometimes
the two realities collide.

161
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:42,500
All of your legendary monsters,
your vanishing aircraft,

162
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:47,958
all of the inexplicable, ancient
artifacts, now explained.

163
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:49,916
You know it's
January 1st, right?

164
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,625
New Year's Day, fellas.

165
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:55,375
Today's a celebration. It's
the start of a brand new era.

166
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:56,083
Which is why--

167
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:58,666
[ZAMEDLE'S DOG barking]

168
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,083
[ZAMEDLE laughs]

169
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,791
[ZAMEDLE] My bad. You know
how I like my monologues.

170
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:03,208
Sorry to keep you waiting.

171
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:05,458
[ZAMEDLE'S DOG barks]

172
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:07,541
[ZAMEDLE]
Anyhow, I've got nothing to do

173
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:11,125
with this natural disaster,
so I'd like to feed my pup now.

174
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:16,208
So then, would you
kindly step aside?

175
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,750
I'll apply my Brain Grid
Blood Battle Technique!

176
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:30,958
[STARPHASE]
Esmerelda Blood Freeze!

177
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:34,208
[KLAUS]
You will not pass us.

178
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:35,416
[chuckles]

179
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,083
My goodness. I have
never been this scared.

180
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:39,458
I'm utterly terrified.

181
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:41,000
You brutes have
frightened me so much

182
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:43,708
I've dropped the leash
of my beloved dog!

183
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:52,958
[ZAMEDLE]
Look away from me, and you die.

184
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,500
[yells]

185
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,958
Lanza del Cero Absoluto!

186
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:13,583
[ZAMEDLE laughs]

187
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:15,625
[ZAMEDLE]
Nicely done, fang hunter.

188
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,458
[KLAUS yells]

189
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:18,708
[yells]

190
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:20,958
[ZAMEDLE]
You're not bad,

191
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:23,041
but you're fighting a
battle you cannot win.

192
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:25,208
The same way no one
can stop this fog

193
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:26,916
from devouring New York.

194
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,583
[bang]

195
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:02,166
[whimpering]

196
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,875
[LUCIANA screams]

197
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,250
He's regenerating too fast.

198
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:25,416
[KLAUS]
Go, Steven.

199
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,958
I'm not leaving, Klaus!

200
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:28,500
You try to take him on your own,

201
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:30,750
he'll feast on the
whole hospital!

202
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:34,958
We deal with the dog afterward.

203
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:36,166
It's a two man fight,

204
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,833
and I'm not gonna let
you martyr yourself!

205
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:47,250
[KLAUS]
I can still see the light.

206
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:48,416
[STARPHASE]
Huh?

207
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:51,833
[KLAUS]
We always stand a half-step

208
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:54,041
between the light and surrender,

209
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:56,791
but I know which
direction I'm taking.

210
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:58,916
Forward. Toward the light.

211
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,416
Even if that half-step takes me
through hell to get there.

212
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,166
[STARPHASE] Good lord, man.
You and your speeches.

213
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,125
I've got one minute
and 40 seconds in me.

214
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:11,500
Exterminate that beast in there
and get back to me by then.

215
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:12,916
[STARPHASE]
Hm.

216
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,083
That's a good number.
Not too modest or too arrogant.

217
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:18,083
Perfectly sums up your
whole personality.

218
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:19,500
Too bad, though.

219
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:21,208
Wish I could witness
the 100 seconds

220
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:23,375
you're about to unleash on him.

221
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:27,625
Three.

222
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:29,875
Two.

223
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:31,041
One!

224
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,416
What stopped it?

225
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,958
Heh.

226
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:11,875
Looks like some wet blankets
went and pooped on the party.

227
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:13,291
Never would've guessed
this dimension

228
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:16,708
had such powerful casters in it.

229
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:18,958
[SAILOR A]
Huh? What the hell?

230
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:33,625
[grunts]

231
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:39,458
[KLAUS]
And then we suddenly woke up,

232
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:41,916
only to find ourselves
surrounded by Hellsalem's Lot,

233
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,833
as it currently stands.

234
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:46,250
[STARPHASE]
Since that day,

235
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:47,708
I can't even tell
you how many times

236
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:49,541
we've searched
for this hospital,

237
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:52,416
but we couldn't find a
trace anywhere we looked.

238
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,833
[LEO]
Whoa.

239
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:56,875
--[horn blaring]
--[tires screeching]

240
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:58,375
[bang]

241
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:04,750
[LEO] Holy crap,
that's a serious pileup!

242
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:07,708
[GUNTHER] On the double!
Act swiftly and calmly!

243
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:13,333
[LEO]
Whoa. Look at 'em go!

244
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:17,958
[GUNTHER]
Ah, so we meet again.

245
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:19,250
Oh!

246
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:20,583
Dr. Gunther!

247
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:22,833
I'm glad to see you're alive.

248
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:26,958
[LUCIANA] Wounds sustained
to neck, back, and abdomen.

249
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:29,416
Red tag him and
send him to Trauma 2!

250
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:32,833
[GUNTHER] We'll have this
wrapped up in no time.

251
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:34,958
Just wait here
if you don't mind.

252
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:40,583
[LUCIANA] Yellow tag for
that one! Curtain 4, got it?

253
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:44,750
Oh, hey! Set him up for
the next available cat scan!

254
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:45,916
[KLAUS]
Hm?

255
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:48,916
[LUCIANA squeals]

256
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:55,416
[LUCIANA whimpers]

257
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:57,833
Wait, that couldn't be...

258
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:00,500
[ZAPP] Get the hell away
from me, you brat!

259
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:01,625
And hey!

260
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:04,541
Gimme back my damn
pants! Perverts!

261
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:09,875
[LEO]
You're okay!

262
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:11,208
[STARPHASE]
All right, Leo.

263
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:13,125
Ya told us there was barely
anything left of him

264
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:14,875
and that he was on
the brink of death.

265
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:16,375
[LUCIANA]
And that's true.

266
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:17,500
But I put him back together

267
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:19,958
and on the path
to a full recovery.

268
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:22,166
In truth, though,
I almost regret it.

269
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,250
Hm?

270
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:28,166
[yelping]

271
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:32,916
Dr. Estevez. Wait just
one moment, please.

272
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:42,666
[LUCIANA CLONE 4] Break's over!
We've got patients in need!

273
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,666
[LUCIANA]
Long time, Mr. Reinherz.

274
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:47,291
And a lot has transpired.

275
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:49,291
[KLAUS]
I'd appreciate an explanation.

276
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:52,791
What exactly happened?
To the hospital, and you.

277
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:55,958
[DIRECTOR] I'd be happy
to answer that for you.

278
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:57,291
Pleasure to meet you, sir.

279
00:16:57,375 --> 00:17:00,833
I'm the director of the
hospital, Magra de Grana.

280
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,791
[DIRECTOR] The day the
Great Collapse occurred,

281
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:08,083
there was a comparable
amount of chaos and panic

282
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:10,000
on our side as well.

283
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:12,625
I was rushing about, giving
treatment to those in need,

284
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:14,125
when suddenly...

285
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:19,708
[DIRECTOR]
Huh?

286
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:27,000
[DIRECTOR] I discovered her
in the midst of the wreckage,

287
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:29,083
barely clinging to life.

288
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:38,333
[LUCIANA]
I consent.

289
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:41,000
Hurry, dammit!

290
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:42,625
[DIRECTOR]
The ability to divide herself

291
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:45,625
and administer multiple
treatments simultaneously,

292
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:47,916
despite the fact she would
no longer be a human.

293
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,375
She chose this existence

294
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:52,666
because it was the only way
to save those around her.

295
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,375
A truly admirable decision.

296
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:57,500
I deeply apologize for
our failure to protect you.

297
00:17:57,583 --> 00:18:00,500
[LUCIANA] Oh, stop that.
Please, Mr. Reinherz.

298
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:03,000
None of us were equipped
for the events of that day.

299
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:04,833
That's all there is to it.

300
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:13,541
[LUCIANA] Although, the 247
patients that were here with us?

301
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,333
It's not over for them.

302
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:18,291
[STARPHASE]
Huh? What do you mean by that?

303
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:22,666
[KLAUS]
Hm? What is this?

304
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,500
[LUCIANA]
An organic life support system,

305
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:25,875
kind of like a cocoon.

306
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:27,375
[STARPHASE]
What for?

307
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:29,041
[LUCIANA] The monster that
attacked the ward infected them

308
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:30,541
with some type of spores

309
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:34,458
that've continued to extract
their vitality to this day.

310
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:37,125
But that changed 13 hours ago.

311
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:39,458
And that's why
we resurfaced here.

312
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:42,125
Their nutrition is no
longer being harvested.

313
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:45,083
So that son of a bitch
is sure to come to collect.

314
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,208
[gasps]

315
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:49,500
[LUCIANA]
He's here!

316
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:53,333
[LUCIANA CLONE 1]
Is that it?

317
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:55,416
The freakin' beast
hyper-evolved on us!

318
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,000
[LUCIANA CLONE 3]
It's disgusting!

319
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:59,041
[LUCIANA CLONE 4]
Bad dog! Bad!

320
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:09,125
[LUCIANA]
I've got a favor to ask.

321
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:11,166
For the sake of our
patients' wellbeing,

322
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,250
I would appreciate
it if you could--

323
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:13,500
Yeah, whatever.

324
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:15,625
So, you stickin' around
on this side for long?

325
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:18,333
'Cause I'm starved enough
to eat an entire buffet.

326
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:20,041
[growls]

327
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:24,000
What's wrong? You gettin' mad?
You gonna attack me, doc?

328
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:25,916
[DIRECTOR]
This is a facility for healing.

329
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,875
Our only objective is treatment,
not the opposite.

330
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:30,166
Ugh, really?

331
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,708
I guess that works
out for all of us,

332
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:33,916
since I got my spores
in yer patients.

333
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,041
So ya probably don't wanna risk
nothin' bad happenin' t' me.

334
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:38,750
[ZAMEDLE'S DOG laughs]

335
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:40,333
[ZAPP]
Hey, ya big ugly bitch!

336
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:43,708
For such a large guy, ya sure do
a lot of little dog yappin'.

337
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:45,250
Now maybe ya
think you're special

338
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:48,166
'cause you're up on two legs,
but I got news for you, pal.

339
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:51,458
That trick is called
begging, so you-- Ah!

340
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:53,500
And that's called shut up!

341
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:06,083
[LUCIANA]
Phardem Triga!

342
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:07,416
[grunts]

343
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,041
What?! You jerk!

344
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:10,458
You really think
you're gonna get away

345
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:12,583
with treatin' me like this?

346
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:14,583
[LUCIANA]
Treating you?

347
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:16,250
That's pretty rich
coming from the creep

348
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:18,750
who's been sucking the
life out of my patients.

349
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:20,333
Well, uh.

350
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:23,333
[LUCIANA] You've got a long life
as a test subject ahead of you.

351
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:24,791
[LUCIANA gasps]

352
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:27,625
How could anyone treat
a dog this poorly?

353
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:30,333
You're heartless.

354
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:31,875
Now die.

355
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,208
[ZAMEDLE]
Well hello, fang hunter.

356
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:39,666
[DIRECTOR]
Dr. Estevez! This way!

357
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:48,666
[ZAMEDLE]
Still haven't learned, huh?

358
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,083
Fight all you want,

359
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,500
but you're just gonna pass out
from blood loss again!

360
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:54,791
And this time, you'll die!

361
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,083
[gasps]

362
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:12,458
[ZAMEDLE]
There's the other one!

363
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:17,708
[STARPHASE]
Not too shabby, Klaus.

364
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:20,791
You held out for 133 seconds.

365
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:22,041
[phone rings]

366
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:26,000
[KLAUS]
Zamedle...

367
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:26,833
...Lolow Zeaze...

368
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:27,666
Shut up!

[screams]

372
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:42,375
Ewiges Gefängnis!

373
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:44,750
Ow!

374
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,083
Doctor Estevez. Thank you.
You have my gratitude for--

375
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,250
These past three years,

376
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:56,583
we've both done
well for ourselves.

377
00:23:40,458 --> 00:23:42,000
[LEO]
I'm givin' you MVP, Zapp.

378
00:23:42,083 --> 00:23:43,791
I mean, we never would've
been here to save the day

379
00:23:43,875 --> 00:23:45,166
if it weren't for
you and that truck.

380
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:47,875
Where the hell's that
roided-out, rat-terrier?

381
00:23:47,958 --> 00:23:49,291
I'll rip him limb from limb!

382
00:23:49,375 --> 00:23:50,541
[LEO]
Uh, that already happened.

383
00:23:50,625 --> 00:23:53,125
Somebody beat me to it?

384
00:23:54,291 --> 00:23:55,500
[CHAIN]
No expectations.

385
00:23:55,583 --> 00:23:58,250
No excess.
No pointless involvement.

386
00:23:58,333 --> 00:23:59,875
One can live a
largely peaceful life

387
00:23:59,958 --> 00:24:02,041
if they stick to
those three rules.

388
00:24:02,125 --> 00:24:03,833
But no matter how hard you try,

389
00:24:03,916 --> 00:24:06,375
things don't always
work out that way.

390
00:24:06,458 --> 00:24:08,458
Holy crap, people are idiots.
