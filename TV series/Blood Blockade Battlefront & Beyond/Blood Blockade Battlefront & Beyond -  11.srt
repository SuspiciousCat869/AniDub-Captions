1
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:01,875
[BLACK] Talk about
a blast from the past.

2
00:02:01,958 --> 00:02:03,250
It's good to see you, man.

3
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:05,291
[LEO] Yeah, you oughta come
back and visit sometime.

4
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,083
[BLACK]
Ha. That's a nice thought.

5
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:09,666
But I'm not sure if I'm ready
for Hellsalem's Lot yet.

6
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,666
That city's inextricably linked
with White in my mind, y'know?

7
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,041
Yeah, sure. I get that.

8
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:18,041
Even so, it'd be nice
to catch up in person.

9
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:19,375
[BLACK chuckles]

10
00:02:19,458 --> 00:02:20,250
Uh?

11
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:21,666
You know how it goes.

12
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,708
We'd probably just end up
talking about our sisters

13
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:24,958
the whole time.

14
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:26,125
You've got a point.

15
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:28,416
[laughs]

16
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,416
[BLACK] Speaking of,
how's Michella been doing?

17
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,541
Oh, well, so-so, I guess.

18
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:36,333
[BLACK]
C'mon, Leo.

19
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:39,875
You really need to actually
call her every once in a while.

20
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:41,000
Well, catch ya later!

21
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:42,541
[LEO]
Whoa, hang on!

22
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,000
[groans]

23
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:49,083
[LEO]
Thanks for the guilt, Black.

24
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:58,166
[MICHELLA]
Hello?

25
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,750
Uh, hey, Michella.

26
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:01,333
[MICHELLA]
Oh my God! Leo?

27
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:03,833
I can't believe I'm
finally hearing from you!

28
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:05,500
Are you really that busy, there?

29
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:07,500
You can't even find
the time to call?

30
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:10,416
Uh, sorry. Things have just
been a little hectic since I--

31
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,083
[MICHELLA] Forget it,
this is actually good timing.

32
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:14,041
Listen, I'm sorry to
spring this on you,

33
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:16,041
but I've got something
to tell you.

34
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:18,250
[LEO]
Huh? Sure, what's up?

35
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:20,791
You ready? Brace yourself.

36
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:22,041
Yeah?

37
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:23,333
[MICHELLA]
So I'm, uh...

38
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:24,458
Yeah?

39
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:26,416
[MICHELLA]
Well, I'm getting married.

40
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,125
Yeah?

41
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:35,125
[LEO]
Huh?!

42
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:36,833
[MICHELLA]
What kind of reaction is that?

43
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:39,833
I know the news is surprising,
but it's not shocking.

44
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:41,500
You're acting like
I murdered someone

45
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:43,916
and I'm asking you
to bury the body.

46
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:47,750
Seriously, you're
hurting my feelings.

47
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:49,958
[LEO] No, no! No,
really, it's just that--

48
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:52,375
I just mean-- I just
mean that just--

49
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:55,375
[MICHELLA] Whatever.
We'll talk about it soon.

50
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:56,791
Surprise part two.

51
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:59,041
I'm actually on my way to
Hellsalem's Lot right now

52
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:00,000
to visit you.

53
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:01,458
Huh?!

54
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,083
[MICHELLA] Well, you are the
only person in our family

55
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:05,000
that still hasn't met my fiancé.

56
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:06,375
[LEO]
Wait, you're coming?

57
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:07,958
Anyway, I've got some
other calls to make,

58
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:09,416
but I'll see you in three days.

59
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,750
[LEO]
Huh?!

60
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:14,416
[MICHELLA] Two PM sharp at
the New Asterisk Hotel.

61
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,833
And you better be
there, Leo! Bye!

62
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:19,375
[LEO]
Hey, wait! Michella!

63
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,583
You don't say.

64
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:25,458
Hmm.

65
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:27,833
[STARPHASE] Well, this makes
for a delicate situation.

66
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:29,458
I know.

67
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:30,541
Hey, Steven.

68
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:32,250
We're on the same page.

69
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:34,416
Here's the thing, kid,
there's a strong likelihood

70
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,291
that you and your sister's
eyes are connected somehow.

71
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:39,333
If something were
to befall Michella,

72
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:43,291
we have no idea what might
happen to your eyes in turn.

73
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:45,000
Reason enough for us
to protect her.

74
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:46,625
She's under our watch.

75
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:48,458
[chuckles]

76
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:50,541
[LEO] Thank you, guys,
that's awesome!

77
00:04:58,333 --> 00:04:59,458
[ZAPP]
Why?

78
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:01,916
Why'd I get stuck on
babysitter duty again?

79
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,458
Stupid, helpless,
unwiped asshole...

80
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:05,041
Oh, drop it.

81
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:07,708
Anyone with one eye can see that
you obviously care about him.

82
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:09,291
So quit with the posturing.

83
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:12,125
Didn't ask for your opinion,
but I will ask why you're here.

84
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:14,791
Well, I wanna see
Leo's little sister,

85
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,625
and witness the
heartfelt reunion.

86
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:18,583
Cool, then there's no
reason for me to be here.

87
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:20,125
Stay put, slacker.

88
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:23,416
I'm on call today so I might
need to duck out at any minute.

89
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:32,250
[K.K.] Aww, it's adorable
how anxious he is.

90
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:33,666
He can't even sit still.

91
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,208
He stood up again!

92
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:36,791
[K.K. squeals]

93
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:38,750
[K.K.] Oh, God, my stomach
is filled with butterflies.

94
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:40,458
You're not watching
a soap opera, y'know.

95
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:42,833
Christ, try not to get
any estrogen on me.

96
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:44,541
[K.K.] Oh, it's like I'm
pregnant with Mothra.

97
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:47,416
So what the hell's your
excuse, Black Lagoon?

98
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,083
Nobody asked you to be here.

99
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:50,791
Oh, don't mind me.

100
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:51,875
I just don't feel comfortable

101
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:53,291
with you standing
guard on your own.

102
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:54,708
[ZAPP]
Huh?!

103
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:56,958
Well, to be more specific,
I'm not worried about Leo

104
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:58,333
so much as I thought
someone might need

105
00:05:58,416 --> 00:05:59,666
to protect his sister from you.

106
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,750
Oh, you think you're
better than me, crab cakes?

107
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:04,250
Why don't ya go eat a net
full of dicks, blow fish!

108
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:05,750
No, I'm okay here,

109
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:08,083
but thank you for confirming
the validity of my concern.

110
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:10,000
Uh.

111
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:13,000
[ZAPP]
What? Patrick? And Neyka?

112
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:16,416
Did the entire agency turn out
to watch this sappy shit?

113
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,291
Uh. Huh?!

114
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:20,166
Oh, you can't be serious!

115
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,958
And they brought that hot,
nerdy doctor with them?

116
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:25,916
[ZAPP] I don't get it, what the
hell is the big draw here?

117
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,875
We're a world-saving
secret society!

118
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:30,625
Don't these friggin' people
have anything better to do

119
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:31,958
with their day?

120
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:41,416
[elevator dings]

121
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:47,416
Thanks so much, sir.

122
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,041
Michella.

123
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:54,916
Is that a big brother I hear?

124
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,958
Feel free to say hello.

125
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:10,250
[MICHELLA] Hey, c'mon,
don't suffocate me.

126
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:13,166
That's not what
Tortoise Knights do.

127
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,958
Are you ever gonna stop
calling me that?

128
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:16,125
[MICHELLA laughs]

129
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:17,625
Sorry.

130
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,916
Have you lost some weight?

131
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,791
[LEO] Maybe, I dunno.
Not like I own a scale.

132
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:30,125
I worry about you, Leo.

133
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:31,833
You've never taken very
good care of yourself

134
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:33,416
when it comes to your diet.

135
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,583
[LEO]
I'm fine, I promise.

136
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:36,541
Are you making sure
to get enough sleep?

137
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:38,541
Yeah, except for last night.

138
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:41,666
Well, sure.
That makes two of us.

139
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,375
[K.K.]
Aww!

140
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:44,791
It's so beautiful!

141
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:48,916
The bond between siblings
is such a wonderful thing!

142
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,833
Gotta say I feel sorry
for your actual kids.

143
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:54,000
So if you were on your way here,

144
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:55,666
what would you have done
if I hadn't called?

145
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,458
I mean, you don't
have my address.

146
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:58,708
[clears throat]

147
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:00,375
[MICHELLA] Oh, sorry,
got a little caught up.

148
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:02,041
I forgot to introduce you.

149
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:07,166
Leo Watch, meet Toby
McLachlan, my fiancé.

150
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:10,041
It's a pleasure to
finally meet you, Leo.

151
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:11,916
I know we've never met before,

152
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
but it feels like I've
known you for years.

153
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:16,833
Michella talks about you
just about every day.

154
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:18,375
She has so much pride in you.

155
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:20,250
According to her, you're
the kindest, strongest,

156
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,916
most reliable man alive.

157
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,666
To be honest, I couldn't help
but feel a little jealous.

158
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,291
Wow, no, I wish I was like that.

159
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:31,458
[TOBY]
Well, sure, I gotta say...

160
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:32,833
You certainly don't
look anything like

161
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:34,583
I was expecting you to.

162
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:35,708
Uh.

163
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:38,958
[TOBY clears throat]

164
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:40,375
Uh, no offense.

165
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:42,791
I believe every word
she's told me about you.

166
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:43,916
You do, huh?

167
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,041
Well, yeah, you said it.

168
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:49,333
So there's no doubt
that it's true.

169
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:50,333
[MICHELLA]
Ha!

170
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:51,958
He's really funny, right?

171
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:54,708
He's always saying all sorts
of silly jokes like that.

172
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:56,208
Wait, what silly joke?

173
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:58,458
I was being entirely
earnest there.

174
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:04,916
[MICHELLA laughing]

175
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,833
Oh, boy, see what I'm
talking about, Leo?

176
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:11,625
[MICHELLA laughs]

177
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:14,375
Doesn't look like trouble's
gonna suddenly rear its head.

178
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:17,500
I feel like we're safe to let
Zapp handle it from here.

179
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:18,875
Sure.

180
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:34,833
[MICHELLA]
What sounds good to you?

181
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:37,416
I figured we could just
get a bottle of red.

182
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:52,833
[LEO] And of course, I'm the
only one who can see this.

183
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:57,875
[MICHELLA]
Why'd we stop?

184
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:01,000
I gotta use the restroom.

185
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:14,583
[GAMIMOZU] Excuse me there,
young Leonardo Watch.

186
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:16,375
You can see me, correct?

187
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:18,666
If not, you would be
woefully inadequate

188
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:21,416
to possess the All-seeing
Eyes of the Gods.

189
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,125
[LEO]
So I guess he knows.

190
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:25,291
Who the hell are you?

191
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,416
Is that Toby guy
even still alive?

192
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,791
You beter not have done anything
messed up to my sister!

193
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:31,166
[laughs]

194
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,833
[GAMIMOZU] From top to bottom,
I'm Doctor Gamimozu.

195
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:35,833
Yes, Toby McLachlan
is still alive.

196
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:39,250
And no, I haven't even laid
a finger on your sister.

197
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:41,000
And what do you want from us?

198
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:43,500
[GAMIMOZU] I've been studying
the various prosthetic limbs

199
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,583
of the Gods scattered
throughout the world.

200
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:49,291
Not to mention
experimenting with them.

201
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:52,458
First time seeing one
outside your own head, right?

202
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:57,166
Feel free to take a closer look.
It's over 150 years old now.

203
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,000
You... You know the truth.

204
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:01,083
Tell me everything you
know about these eyes!

205
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:04,375
And start with why the hell
my sister had to be involved!

206
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:07,458
[GAMIMOZU]
Ohh. Your anger does make sense.

207
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:10,750
Bestowing the eyes upon such an
average human like yourself,

208
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:14,041
Riga El's actions were
cruel to say the least.

209
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:15,208
[LEO]
Riga?

210
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:17,250
[GAMIMOZU]
Riga El Menuhyut.

211
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:21,916
Personal ophthalmological
engineer to the divine.

212
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,958
I believe that you've already
made his acquaintance.

213
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:31,083
[GAMIMOZU] I've heard the
story from your dear sister.

214
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:32,583
I believe he asked you to choose

215
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:35,333
which of you two would
bear witness, right?

216
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:39,791
And that, my boy, is precisely
what your calling entails.

217
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:41,833
Ever since the dawn of mankind,

218
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:44,791
the All-seeing Eyes of the Gods
have been routinely dispersed

219
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:47,958
amongst your species to
monitor all significant events.

220
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,916
Essentially, these eyes--well,
it wouldn't be inaccurate

221
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,750
to describe them as the world's
most successful hidden cameras,

222
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:56,625
since they've spied on every
critical moment in history.

223
00:11:56,708 --> 00:12:00,708
The emergence of Hellsalem's
Lot is easily mankind's--no,

224
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:03,666
it's easily Earth's most
significant occurrence,

225
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:07,041
eclipsing every last thing
that came before it.

226
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:09,666
To be chosen as its
official observer?

227
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:13,958
Good lord, man, I envy
how fortunate you are!

228
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,708
[LEO]
Did you say I'm fortunate?

229
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:20,833
Is that some sick joke?

230
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:23,125
If you ever say that
in front of Michella,

231
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:25,625
I'll kick your ass
out your mouth!

232
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:36,583
[GAMIMOZU] Oh, I'm sorry,
were you saying something?

233
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:38,083
And get this,

234
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:39,916
nobody told Danny so the putz
went ahead and ordered it!

235
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,291
Oh, the poor dumbass.

236
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:42,166
[BOTH laugh]

237
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,583
[GAMIMOZU chuckes]

238
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:46,125
[GAMIMOZU] That's the brilliant
beauty of these eyes.

239
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:49,083
Every eyeball in this
place is under my control,

240
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:52,583
and they only see
what I want them to.

241
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:56,083
I have to say, this new
model is truly exquisite.

242
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:57,500
Tell me, Leonardo,

243
00:12:57,583 --> 00:13:00,833
you're absolutely ravenous
for vengeance, aren't you?

244
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:02,458
Provide me with one of your eyes

245
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:04,458
and we might be able
to strike a deal.

246
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:06,666
In fact, cooperating
with my research

247
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:10,750
is the best chance you have at
restoring your sister's vision.

248
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:16,666
Hey, Leo.

249
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,208
So your sister's fine
and everything's cool

250
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:21,958
and there's really no
reason for me to be here.

251
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:23,500
Right?

252
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,583
I, uh, actually...

253
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:26,958
[ZAPP]
See, the thing is,

254
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:29,208
Miranda dropped by my place
and found Nyala there

255
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:31,416
and now they've turned my
apartment into a warzone.

256
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,208
Aw, shit, this looks bad.

257
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:35,708
Anyway, I gotta go, so
you're gonna be fine, right?

258
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:36,583
[LEO]
Please don't leave!

259
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:39,291
Heh? Is there somethin' wrong?

260
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:43,458
Uh. No, I--
It's just that I, uh--

261
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:45,958
Dude, you'll conceivably
be fine on your own.

262
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:47,666
[LEO]
Yeah, but still--

263
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:50,083
Christ, ya look like you're
about to shit your pants.

264
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:52,583
Calm down, I'm leavin'
the fish here for ya.

265
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:53,791
And seriously, man,

266
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,791
you gotta be able to
protect your own family.

267
00:13:55,875 --> 00:14:00,458
I mean, you are a member
of Libra after all.

268
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:03,416
Okay, good luck. Don't die!

269
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,916
[GAMIMOZU]
This Libra he mentioned...

270
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,583
Don't tell me you're a fang
hunter. You are, aren't you?

271
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:11,208
You snuck into their ranks
using your eyes' powers.

272
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:12,708
Impressively done.

273
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:15,750
[clock chimes]

274
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:17,000
[GAMIMOZU]
Oh, my.

275
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:19,958
This bathroom break has
turned worrisomely long.

276
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:23,875
So then, it's time that we
get back to your sister.

277
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:44,958
[MICHELLA] The castle's
haunted and full of ghosts.

278
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:47,333
[LEO] They look like they're
some pretty scary dudes.

279
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:49,541
Yep, and anytime
the mighty warrior

280
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:51,375
goes in the castle
to fight them,

281
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:53,500
the ghosts hide themselves
by turning invisible

282
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:55,791
and trick the warrior.

283
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:58,375
[LEO] So how does he
even fight them, then?

284
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:00,333
[MICHELLA]
Hmm...

285
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:01,666
Huh, good question.

286
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:04,500
What?! You haven't
thought that up yet?!

287
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:06,291
[giggles]

288
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:12,375
There he is. My brave
Tortoise Knight.

289
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:17,083
Sorry, that took a while.

290
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:21,125
[LEO] She knows that
something's wrong.

291
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:22,458
[MICHELLA]
But I'll see you in three days.

292
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:23,791
[LEO]
Huh?!

293
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:27,166
[MICHELLA] Two PM sharp
at the New Asterisk Hotel.

294
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,291
[LEO] That would explain
why she's been more assertive

295
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:32,166
than usual.

296
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:36,208
There's no one else she can turn
to, so she came to me for help.

297
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:40,333
All alone, with an unknown
creature at her back.

298
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,333
[phone rings]

299
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:54,375
[GAMIMOZU]
Hmm?

300
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:56,000
Hey, what's up, Steven?

301
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:57,791
Sorry to interrupt, Leo.

302
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:05,375
Nice, a direct head shot!

303
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:06,458
[gasps]

304
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:13,416
[STARPHASE] We've got a
rampaging Blood Breed.

305
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:18,000
Right. Yeah. I understand.

306
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:19,291
I'm sorry, Sis.

307
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:20,791
A little emergency
just sprang up

308
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:22,375
and I need to go
take care of it.

309
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:23,666
Huh?

310
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:27,166
I'll head straight back
as soon as it's handled!

311
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,916
[TOBY] I do hope that you'll be
able to make it back by tonight.

312
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,416
We don't have much time and
there's plenty to discuss.

313
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:36,000
There's the matter of her eyes,
and our wedding, of course.

314
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:37,916
Not to mention our
plans for afterward.

315
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,041
And really, that's just
scratching the surface.

316
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:43,583
[MICHELLA] Okay, guys. You
trying to keep secrets from me?

317
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,916
No, not at all.

318
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,625
I deeply love your sister, Leo.

319
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,708
And I want to help her.

320
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:54,958
Right, I'll try
not to take long.

321
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,583
[LEO] That was pretty
messed up in there.

322
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:08,958
What the hell was that?

323
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:11,791
You don't give a shit about
helping her. Screw you!

324
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:14,291
[GAMIMOZU] I didn't choose
those words to toy with you.

325
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:17,541
In fact, that was
Toby's natural response.

326
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:21,500
The perfect simulacrum requires
the perfect source material.

327
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:24,250
He genuinely is a fine,
upstanding gentleman.

328
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:26,250
Your sister really
knows how to pick 'em.

329
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:29,208
So where are we rushing
off to? I'm dying to know.

330
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:31,000
[LEO]
Shit, this is bad.

331
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,208
I've gotta shake him somehow.

332
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:41,000
Leo! Over here!

333
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:42,333
[LEO groans]

334
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:50,500
[DANIEL]
Crap!

335
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:54,000
[POLICESUIT A] You need to
step back, Lieutenant!

336
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:55,166
It's too dangerous!

337
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,416
Shut your hole!
Just keep him surrounded!

338
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:00,416
If he gets past us,
I'm docking your pay!

339
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,666
[STARPHASE]
Lieutenant Law.

340
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:03,791
[DANIEL]
About time.

341
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,083
What's the situation?

342
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:06,416
[DANIEL]
Take a look for yourself.

343
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,666
It's an absolute shit show.

344
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:11,000
Our sniper detail managed
to blow his head off

345
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:12,666
with a series of
explosive rounds,

346
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,583
but that didn't
exactly stop him.

347
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:16,625
It just made things worse.

348
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,416
[gasps]

349
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:31,166
[DANIEL]
What the hell is it doing now?

350
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,125
He can't seem to
regenerate his head.

351
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:35,833
Then the good news is he's
not an Elder-class, at least.

352
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:38,458
Although... that
doesn't help us much.

353
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:40,333
He has all of the powers
of a Blood Breed,

354
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:42,791
but he's rampaging
like a wild beast.

355
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:45,250
This is bad.

356
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:46,375
[gasps]

357
00:18:56,833 --> 00:19:00,041
Get back some! We'll buy you
some time while you work.

358
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:03,333
We'll do what we can.
Back us up with firepower.

359
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:08,250
[K.K.]
Ew.

360
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:10,291
Damn, that thing's ugly.

361
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:20,541
[GAMIMOZU]
How fascinating.

362
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:23,083
It's been quite some time
since I've seen a Blood Breed.

363
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:26,666
But a rabid, crazed one like
this is a rather rare anomaly.

364
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:27,750
[LEO]
Dammit.

365
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:28,916
I've gotta help them,

366
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,583
but I can't let him
see what I'm doing.

367
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:34,875
So what...? What do I do?

368
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:42,583
[STARPHASE]
Esmerelda Blood Freeze!

369
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:47,083
Escudo del Cero Absoluto!

370
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,041
[GAMIMOZU]
Huh? Something wrong?

371
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:57,250
You're just frozen there
gripping your phone.

372
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:59,083
You were about to do
something, weren't you?

373
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:02,666
I mean, you do have some
role to fulfill here, correct?

374
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:06,416
[STARPHASE] Doesn't even
matter if he's corrupted,

375
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,375
we can't hold a Blood
Breed for ten seconds.

376
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:12,750
[KLAUS]
Leo, hurry.

377
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:19,083
[STARPHASE]
He shed his exterior! Dammit!

378
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:21,625
We can't let him
become a Zhen Tai Dan!

379
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:29,500
Well, boys, he's all yours.

380
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:32,583
[ZED] Big Dipper
Style Blood Technique.

381
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:34,250
Blade number Five!

382
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:39,208
Blade One!
Kagutsuchi Homuramaru!

383
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:43,166
Shinatobe Piercing Dragon Spear!

384
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:57,416
[ZAPP]
Seven Hells!

385
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,708
[ZED]
Heavenly Winged Bellows!

386
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:03,625
What are you
waiting for, dick bag?

387
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,208
Hurry the hell up already!

388
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,958
[screaming]

389
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:37,833
[BLOOD BREED roars]

390
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:43,750
[KLAUS] Ardamachael Zi--
Zirlahia Or Salzmailoros!

391
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:46,000
I hereby seal you!

392
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:51,750
[KLAUS]
Ewiges Gefängnis!

393
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:55,708
[roars]

394
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:03,250
[GAMIMOZU]
So that's your trick!

395
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:06,958
Ha-ha! Well done, Leonardo!
A remarkable feat!

396
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:10,083
Using the power of your eyes
to uncover their true names?

397
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:13,625
No wonder Libra considers you
to be such a valuable asset.

398
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:14,958
This is splendid!

399
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:17,833
Your access alone can
take me to the next level.

400
00:22:17,916 --> 00:22:19,375
That settles it!

401
00:22:19,458 --> 00:22:24,875
Leonardo. I believe the time
has come for me to possess you.

402
00:23:54,708 --> 00:23:56,791
[LEO] Back when I first
moved to this city,

403
00:23:56,875 --> 00:24:00,250
I used to have such dark
and depressing thoughts.

404
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:01,583
But these days,

405
00:24:01,666 --> 00:24:05,333
I can't even remember
what those thoughts were.

406
00:24:05,416 --> 00:24:08,500
Michella, I think
I'm about to--
