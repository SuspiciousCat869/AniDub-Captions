[LEO]
Doctor Estevez?

28
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:11,291
[LUCIANA] So I heard you
tried to head-butt an ogre

29
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:13,250
and knocked yourself out.

30

Eh?

I'll kill him.

This one counts as
a killable offense.

00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:25,041
Wait. That's right.

35
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:26,458
While I'm here...

36
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:27,541
[LUCIANA]
Hm?

37
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:32,041
[LUCIANA]
Hmm...

38
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:34,750
I really can't say that
I would recommend it.

39
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:37,000
I mean, sure, we perform
plenty of arcane,

40
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:39,250
thaumaturgic procedures
from the other side,

41
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:41,083
but we try not to
use them on humans

42
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:43,916
'cause when they go wrong,
they go disastrously wrong.

43
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,166
We're talking stitches
turning inside out,

44
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,333
malignant tumors
becoming sentient,

45
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:49,541
and even the random mutation

46
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:52,125
of previously healthy
friends and family.

47
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:53,541
So attempting an operation

48
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:55,875
that would allow your
sister to walk again,

49
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:58,166
and one that would restore
her sight, to boot,

50
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:01,375
well, that would require
some highly volatile magic.

51
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:07,750
[LEO] Right, so I'm guessing
that goes for my eyes, too?

[LUCIANA]
The All-seeing Eyes of the Gods.

00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:23,208
This is the first time I've seen
them outside of a textbook.

00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:24,333
Textbook?

59
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:25,625
How much have you
studied the history

60
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:27,500
of the All-seeing
Eyes of the Gods?

61
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:28,666
Are the stories true?

62
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,000
Does someone else
always have their sight

63
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:31,708
taken from them in exchange?

64
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:33,458
Well, I'm no expert, but--

65
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:35,666
[DIRECTOR]
Fortunately, I am.

66
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,416
And of all the
incidents reported

67
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,541
through 53 volumes
of literature,

68
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:42,125
that has always been the case.

69
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:43,458
Tell me, Leonardo,

70
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:45,666
are you trying to find a
way to reverse the effects

71
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,333
on your sister's eyes?

72
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:49,416
Well, yeah, of course I am!

73
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,666
That's the entire reason I even
moved to Hellsalem's Lot

74
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,958
in the first place.

75
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:56,000
[DIRECTOR]
That's understandable.

76
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:58,750
Although, in all of the
passages documenting

77
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:02,000
those who came to possess the
All-seeing Eyes of the Gods,

78
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:05,250
there isn't a single
mention of reversal.

79
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:07,583
And I sincerely doubt
that they can be removed

80
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:09,750
by any known medical procedure.

81
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:12,250
If I had to surmise,
such an action would be

82
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:15,875
a unilateral breach of contract
with a divine being.

83
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:19,500
The price of which,
would surely be exorbitant.

84
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:39,041

Damn it. Nothing but dead ends.

00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:51,416
[MICHELLA]
It's me.

00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,875
Oh, so you get to be a princess,
but I'm just a dumb turtle?

[MICHELLA] Ha! That's not
all you are! Look closer.

92

You're a brave and
heroic tortoise knight.

93
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:01,666
See, you protect the princess
from the evil ghosts.

94
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,625
But you still made me a turtle.

95
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:05,333
So? Turtles are good.

96
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:09,625
Turtles are slow.

never any kind of knight.

acknowledge the adversity

in the path before him,

101
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,833
and yet he still struggles
toward the light,

102
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:37,291
then his spirit can't be broken!

103

to objects made from pubes!

Okay, okay.
Sorry, Professor Pubes.

110
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:00,041

make it any less insulting!

How can such a calm,

be so utterly terrifying?

'Cause the nicer he acts,

yourself too hard.

Not like I have
much of a choice.

If one more major
earthshaker gets summoned,

it could wipe out
the entire city.

00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:05,625
I'm guessin' they overlooked
some of his tissue,

162
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:07,583
'cause that's him.

163
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:10,208
Prepare for crisis response!

164
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:12,166
If we let him evolve
any further than he has,

165
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,583
there'll be no stopping him.

166
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:16,125
This time, we eradicate
every last molecule.

167
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:19,541
Well then, I'm gonna run
down to the corner store.

168
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:24,333
[sighs]

169
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,250
[gasps]

170
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:00,541
[JOSH]
Ah, crap, my wallet.

171
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:05,416
[BIG GUY A]
Hm? Do I know you, asshole?

172
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:08,875
[PLANARIO]
Even if I'm defeated,

173
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:12,166
my next regeneration
will surely-- Ah!

174
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:14,625
[STARPHASE]
Pack it up!

175
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:16,166
I did the hard work for ya,

176
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,750
now make sure you incarcerate
or incinerate him this time!

177
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:19,708
[GARRETT]
Copy that.

178
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:21,166
Make sure you don't shatter him!

179
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,375
It'll leave tissue behind!

180
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:25,958
Well, that was efficient.

181
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:31,166
Something's wrong, Klaus.

182
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:34,000
I can't reach Anila.
The lines are down.

183
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:39,791
[BIG GUY A] Huh? Now who
the hell are you people?

184
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:42,583
[ZAPP]
Tch.

185
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:45,250
[KLAUS] Are you all right, Josh?
What happened here?

186
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:48,166
[JOSH]
Th-The entrance changed.

187
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:51,500
[LEO] What? How is that
not an elevator anymore?

188
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:54,083
Remain calm.
We'll figure this out.

189
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:56,125
That's not the only
office entrance.

190
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:58,916
Everyone split up and
search for the elevator.

191
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:03,250
[KLAUS]
Hm? You okay, Steven?

192
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:04,208
Huh? Yeah.

193
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:05,291
[ZAPP]
This way, jack ass.

194
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:07,125
[KLAUS]
I'll contact Yurian, as well.

195
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:10,083
You just wait down here
and rest until he arrives.

196
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:11,625
Sure, thanks.

197
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:18,583
[STARPHASE]
What the hell is going on here?

198
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,791
There's something on your head.

199
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:31,541
I can't get 'em off.

200
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:33,500
[STARPHASE] I take it you
didn't have any luck.

201
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:35,041
Nope.

202
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:36,541
[ZAPP grunting]

203
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:37,791
[STARPHASE]
How'd it go?

204
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:40,666
[ZED] Not good. It led
to a subway platform.

205
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,083
Same with my door.

206
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:44,833
It revealed an equipment room
I've never seen before.

207
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:48,000
[YURIAN] Hey, sorry
to keep you waiting.

208
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:50,291
Heard you guys are
in need of a locksmith.

209
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:53,375
Yurian! You made it.
Thanks for coming.

210
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:54,541
[chuckles]

211
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:03,000
[YURIAN]
Hm.

212
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:06,291
Well, this is pretty serious.
You're at DEFCON Level 2.

213
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:07,708
[STARPHASE]
What?

214
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:09,291
[YURIAN] Even worse, security's
completely battened down

215
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:11,416
from the inside.

216
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,458
Is anybody still in there?

217
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:15,208
[STARPHASE]
Anila might be.

218
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:16,333
[YURIAN]
Could she be doing anything

219
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:18,250
that would trigger the alarm?

220
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:20,208
[STARPHASE]
Nothing I can think of.

221
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:22,958
She's just been
crunching our algorithm.

222
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:24,833
[YURIAN]
Okay, then.

223
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:26,166
Whatever caused it,

224
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:28,250
our access is completely
restricted from out here,

225
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:30,625
both physically and magically.

226
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:33,000
[LEO]
Uh.

227
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:38,916
[LEO]
It's Chain!

228
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,416
Oh, goddammit.

229
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,583
She doesn't know
about the lockout!

230
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:46,000
[phone ringing]

231
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:47,625
Hello. Go for Cha--

232
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:55,375
Chain, no!

Crimson Orb-weaver!

235
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:12,166
[KLAUS]
Do you feel all right, Chain?

236
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,666
[CHAIN]
Yeah, but... I saw them.

237
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:15,916
[STARPHASE]
Huh?

238
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,208
The office. The place is
filled with giant bugs.

239
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:21,000
They looked like--I don't know--

240
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:24,166
almost like crane flies, but
they were three feet long!

241
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,333
Well that's gross.

242
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:26,875
Ugh.

243
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:30,500
But y'know, it's just a bunch
of stupid bugs, right?

244
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:32,166
Even if there's a billion
of them in there,

245
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,500
it's not like an insect can
hack our defense system

246
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:37,958
and crank up the DEFCON level.

247
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:40,708
[ZED] That would require
a level of intelligence.

248
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:42,125
[STARPHASE] But if we
assume just one of them

249
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:44,375
infiltrated the office
and spawned thousands

250
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:45,750
within the last two hours,

251
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:47,500
we can't really rule
out the possibility

252
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:50,958
they're evolving at an
inconceivably accelerated rate.

253
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,750
Well, this just topped
the urgency list.

254
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:59,583
Yurian, how much time will
it take to hack the system

255
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:01,291
and override this lockout?

256
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:04,000
Give me three hours and
I should have it sorted out.

257
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:05,416
Then hop to.

258
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,500
Our top priority is recovering
that code trace data.

259
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:09,875
We've gotta stop that summons.

260
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:11,500
There's only a few
days before they--

[LEO whimpers]

262
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,416
[STARPHASE]
What's wrong, Leo?

263
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:19,041
You know that earthshaker thing?

264
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:21,541
Well, uh, they've
already summoned it.

265
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:24,708
What the hell?
That is way too fast!

266
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:26,333
Bastards must've figured
out how to shorten

267
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:28,583
the minimum incantation time!

268
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:31,791
Yeah, it could be that.

269
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:35,250
But personally, I'm not
seein' a damn thing.

270
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:36,625
[STARPHASE]
Shit!

271
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:38,541
If his fingertips touch the
ground, we're all dead!

What's up, Dr. Starphase?

274
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:44,208
Greetings from above.

275
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:45,916
I'm in position, so relax.

276
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,583
Wait. You're what, K.K?

277
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:50,041
[K.K.] Why do you sound
like there's a turd

278
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:51,333
in your underwear?

279
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:52,583
Were you not listening to me?

280
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:54,958
I just told you that I'm
here to save the day.

281
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:57,375
So maybe try to muster up
a little gratitude?

282
00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:58,791
[STARPHASE]
Whoa! What're you doing?

283
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:02,583
[K.K.] Ew, that is one alarming
infestation in there.

284
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:04,416
I mean, it looks like an apiary.

285
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,500
Anyhow, I'm gonna blast
a shock round in there

286
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:09,416
and paint the walls
with some bug guts.

Don't you dare!

288
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:14,583
I'm running code to
save the world in there

289
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:16,500

not've gotten out!

You are just one more
thunder fart in this shit storm

00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:20,625
I don't need!

292
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:21,500
[K.K.]
Tch.

293
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:22,625
Did you just click your tongue?

294
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:25,375
Oh, did I disappoint
you, you lunatic?

295

[phone beeping]

296
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:34,041
[INSECT] Nice do meed you,
gen... tlemen.

297
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:36,500
[KLAUS]
Who is this? Identify yourself.

298
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:38,541
[INSECT]
We do nod...

299
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:40,833
...have a name.

300
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:46,250
We only became aware of
our existence when you did.

301
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:49,458
But in the amount of
time that's transpired,

302
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:52,791
we now function on the
same level as humanity,

303
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:55,583
and will soon surpass you.

304
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:57,625
[KLAUS]
And what is your objective here?

305
00:15:57,708 --> 00:16:00,750
[INSECT] Oh, my objective?
It's really quite simple.

306
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:02,375
I intend to borrow this office

307
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:06,500
until my evolution crescendos
and I've become a god.

308
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:08,500
[KLAUS]
I'm afraid that's unacceptable.

309
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:10,291
It's imperative we
return to the office

310
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:11,833
and we have no time to waste.

311

[INSECT] You seem to have
misunderstood my words.

314
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:21,250
I am not requesting your
acquiescence in the matter.

315
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:25,541
The number of options
available to you are zero.

[LEO]
Whoa, there's a web of light.

317
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:33,416
[YURIAN] That's really bad.
They've gone to DEFCON 1!

[ALL gasp]

320
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:45,541
[STARPHASE]
It's hopeless.

321
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:48,541
Nobody can get past
that level of security.

322
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:58,500
Leonardo, you said you can
see a web of light, correct?

323
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:00,333
[LEO]
Uh, yeah?

324
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:02,375
I need to assess this situation.

325
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:04,625
Can you hack my eyes
so I can see it?

326
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:06,500
[LEO]
Oh, of course!

327
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:12,083
[KLAUS]
Hm. There it is.

328
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:15,333
[ZAPP] Hey, Chief.
What exactly are you planning?

329
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:16,791
[KLAUS]
Throughout history,

330
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:19,458
anytime a warrior was
locked out of a fortress,

331
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:21,708
they snuck in through
the top floor.

332
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:35,166
[KLAUS] What happens if
my Blood Battle Technique

333
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,541
reaches its activation limit

334
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:39,166
and the blood returns
to its natural state?

335
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:42,666
One drop on that web and
it'll blow you sky high.

336
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,250
Okay, I'm glad I asked.

337
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:47,500
I'll need to infuse my blood to
hold its state all the way up.

338
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:48,833
What?

339
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:51,083
Sorry, Chief, but have you
lost your goddamn mind?

340
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:52,291
Your technique requires

341
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:54,291
a whole other insane
level of concentration

342
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:57,208
than our burning
or freezing types.

343
00:17:57,291 --> 00:17:58,875
I'm well aware.

344
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:01,291
It's a good thing
I have discipline.

345
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:14,166
[PEDESTRIANS screaming]

346
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:31,541
[LEO] Klaus will always
refuse to give up.

347
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:34,041
I don't even think he knows how.

348
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:43,833
Now, K.K., commence
with the operation.

349
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:46,666
[K.K.] Get a tight grip
on those blood daggers.

350
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,125
[INSECT laughs]

351
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:52,708
[INSECT]
How pathetic.

352
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:55,916
Are they really unaware of how
robust their own security is?

353
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,583
Bullets are about as effective
as tossing pebbles at a tank.

354
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:18,750
Now that I think about
it, this isn't right.

355
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,125
[gasps]

356
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:27,125
Damn, it was a diversion.

[ALL gasp]

00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:48,583
[YURIAN] All right, perfect!
I've got an opening now!

[KLAUS]
Yurian.

360
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,416
What's the likelihood of
deactivating the barrier?

361
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,875
It's impossible!

362
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:55,458
I only need a moment.

363
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:58,125
If you can crack it open
for just a few seconds,

364
00:19:58,208 --> 00:20:00,416
I can force my way in.

365
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:06,958
It's gonna work, but holy
crap this keyhole's small.

Only about 20 feet left

Oh, dammit! I've

You're gonna miss it, dumb ass!

around it, man!

We're almost there!

Hell yeah!

Oh, yeah! Good idea!

[VILLAIN B] Ha-ha! Screw it!
Let's start the count!

most consequential lockout

395
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:41,375
in the history of the

396
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:43,416
Steven looked like he
was about to collapse

397
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,791
right there on the street,

398
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:47,416
but he still stuck around
to finish the post work.

399
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:51,333
Once done, he left early to
finally catch up on his sleep.

400
00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:53,666
Our defense system underwent
a major overhaul,

401
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:56,250
which temporarily
closed down the office.

And during that downtime,

407
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:08,208
we lost the one place where
we could get away from work.

408
00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:45,458
I won't give up.

409
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:52,458
[LEO]
And that's a promise, Michella.

00:23:54,125 --> 00:23:55,708
[ZED]
When you encounter loneliness,

411
00:23:55,791 --> 00:23:57,708
it leaves you helpless
and confused,

412
00:23:57,791 --> 00:24:00,458
and the despair of it
never stops gnawing at you.

413
00:24:00,541 --> 00:24:01,916
But take heart, friends.

414
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Because if you can find
despair in this world,

415
00:24:04,083 --> 00:24:07,458
then it's a certainty that hope
is there to be found as well.
