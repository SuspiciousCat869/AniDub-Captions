Well that's quite the get.
Well done, party committee.

Here, check it out!

I can't believe
I pulled this off.

It's kind of a miracle,

21
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:55,083
but I booked one of the
hottest bars in the city.

22
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:56,291
The place is so exclusive

23
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:58,208
that they move the
entrance every day.

24
00:02:58,291 --> 00:02:59,958
It's isolated in mobile space,

25
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:02,791

I'd have a better chance
of getting that money back

if I ate it and then
set my poop on fire.

[ZAPP] You pay how much
for that fish tank?

41
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:45,833
It's costly, but the equipment
has to be custom-made for him

42
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:47,750
so it's a necessary
expenditure.

That's bullshit! Just
get him a kiddie pool!

Wow. Prostitutes don't
count as a living expense.

Equipment costs aside,

47
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:59,916
operating funds are equally
dispersed through our payroll.

Yeah, it's a goddamn pittance!

[MILA] An astute observation,
Your Majesty.

318
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:40,708
The true melody of the world
is one of escalating chaos.

319
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:42,416
There's no way to
really anticipate

320
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,166
what threats may be looming.

321
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:47,041
However, you can still be
properly prepared for them,

322
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:49,125
and our company
provides such prep--

Hop to it, she-bitch!

326
00:17:58,083 --> 00:17:59,833
The alpha asshole's gonna
be on the top floor

327
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:02,083
and I just made an
entrance for ya.

328
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:04,000
Holy crap, I hate him.

[SECURITY GUARDS gasping]

330
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:09,375
Hey, so, um, is there
anything I can do to help?

331
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:10,875
Yeah, stay outta my damn way.

332
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:13,333
And don't get killed. I don't
wanna slip in your blood.

333
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:15,291
Huh?!

334
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:18,166
We're under attack?
How many of them are there?

335
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:33,833
Just two of them against
the 4000 Series?

336
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:35,333
That's impossible!

337
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:36,375
[gasps]

338
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,041
Get away from those!
How'd you even get in here?

339
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,416
Put the headphones
back in the case now.

340
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:51,208
If you choose not to obey me,
I'll fill you with holes.

Did she just dodge that?

343
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:06,666
Don't think you're
walking out of here!

344
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,833
This building is
like a fortress!

[CHAIN] I can't imagine
it feels too good

347
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:21,083
to be lifted by your myocardium.

[CHAIN] You seem to
be rather successful,

00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:27,625
and hey, good for you.

351
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,541
I'm guessing that you're used
to manipulating the world

352
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:30,958
at your whim.

353
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:32,625
But you're not invincible.

354
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:35,750
You pull this kind of crap
again with a friend of mine...

355
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:37,333
...I'll pack your

Ohh!

Well, they all appear to be

[ZED]
Before you act in the future,

373
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:55,333
can you please assess
all factors first?

Are you serious, dude?!

Huh?

Oh, yeah, I almost forgot.
Zed's doing really well now.

He even went so far as

he's reelin' these suckers in?

If that was a fish
pun, it sucked.

402
00:23:54,583 --> 00:23:56,416
[ZAPP] You ever notice
how fast the frail are

403
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,416
to shamelessly rattle off
their shortcomings

404
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:01,333
and use them as an excuse
to hide from everything?

405
00:24:01,416 --> 00:24:02,375
Jesus.

406
00:24:02,458 --> 00:24:03,875
Just put on your big boy pants

407
00:24:03,958 --> 00:24:05,791
and quit thinkin'
of 'em as flaws.

That's what true strength is.
