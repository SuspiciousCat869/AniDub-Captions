stocked up on wine for tonight?

But if you're offering
to bring a bottle,

I won't discourage you.

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,791
More composed than when
you called me this morning.

164
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:46,166
This is Christopher.

165
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,041
Hello.

166
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:48,291
How's it goin'?

167
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:50,291
[LARRY] And I thought
I was showin' up early.

168
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:52,041
Larry! You made it!

169
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:54,500
I'm hoping you've got
a big ass fridge.

170
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:55,666
[STARPHASE]
Damn, Larry,

171
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,250
you brought a whole
meat locker with ya.

172
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:58,458
Oh, that's right.

173
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:02,208
I forgot to check if
we have any charcoal.

174
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:03,083
Dammit.

175
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:04,791
Heh! You start without us?

176
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:06,125
Well, maybe one or two.

177
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:08,125
[CHARLIE] Crippling symptoms
of working too hard.

178
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:09,291
The only known cure is for us

179
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,833
to drink you under
the table tonight.

180
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:12,583
[STARPHASE chuckles]

181
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:15,333
[STARPHASE] I better go hang an
IV for tomorrow, in that case.

182
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:17,041
Come on in. Make
yourselves at home.

183
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:18,541
[LARRY]
You do that,

184
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:21,666
but don't be surprised if I fill
your IV bag with Opus One.

185
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:29,250
[STARPHASE]
Hey, Veded.

186
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:31,000
Thank you, but I can
take it from here.

187
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:33,416
You can head on home.

188
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,583
You're sure?

189
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:40,416
[GUESTS chattering]

190
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,125
Thanks for all your help.

191
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,083
Well, if you're certain.

192
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:54,583
Now then.

193
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:00,333
[STARPHASE]
All right, everyone. Shall we?

194
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:03,333
[GUESTS cheering]

195
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:10,250
Huh? A weapon?

196
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:13,166
So, you've finally come
to your senses, have you?

197
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,708
A dinky little squirt like you,

198
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:17,750
it's just crazy to be walkin'
around this city unarmed.

199
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:20,250
Now what's a good fit for you?

200
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:21,166
[chuckles]

201
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,166
Wha'cha think?

202
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,083
She cuts a ten
foot diameter hole

203
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,416
in the fabric of space itself!

204
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,166
[PATRICK sighs]

205
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:30,791
[PATRICK]
Huh? That one?

206
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:33,041
That's nothin' but a stun baton.

207
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:35,750
Can't even kill your
opponent with that thing.

208
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:38,750
That's fine by me. I'll take it.

209
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,791
[PATRICK]
Hmm...

210
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:54,750
[PUNK A laughs]

211
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:57,000
[PUNK A]
Let's do some shots!

212
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:58,875
--[WAITRESS A] Watch it, creep!
--[LEO] There he is.

[PUNKS laughing]

214
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:02,833
[LEO]
Hey!

215
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:04,541
I-I want my wallet!

216
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:05,958
Piss off.

217
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:09,541
I don't won'chur whiny,
ugly-ass face ruinin' my night.

218
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:11,708
That money is for
my blind sister.

219
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:14,000
I'm asking you to
do the right thing--

220
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:17,208
Do I really strike you as
the type to give a shit

221
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:18,916
about anyone's sister?

222
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,708
Blind or not.

223
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:28,958
Real scary. I'm pissin'
my pants here.

224
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:31,666
[LEO] It won't kill you,
but it'll hurt like hell.

225
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:34,583
The shock'll just knock you out
and keep you still for a bit.

226
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:36,875
[PUNK A]
You sure it won't kill me?

227
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:38,333
What if I've got a pacemaker

228
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:40,625
or just some kind of
weak heart condition?

229
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:43,458
'Cause that would make
you a murderer.

230
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:44,625
[chuckles]

231
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:56,375
[PUNK A]
Here. Ya left this.

232
00:11:56,458 --> 00:12:00,250
[LEO screams]

233
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:02,833
All right, Hellsalem's
Lot's a joke.

234
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:05,291
One thousand years
of domination my ass.

235
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:07,500
Cleveland's tougher than this.

236
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:16,875
[PUNKS laughing]

237
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:23,666
[PUNK B]
Ahh...

238
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,166
Well. Hello, beautiful.

239
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,833
Ya just get here?

240
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:29,416
No way in hell I
could've overlooked

241
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,625
a gorgeous fox like you.

242
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:33,125
Don't think I've
seen you before.

243
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:34,708
Wait, are you from outside?

244
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:36,250
Ya got me.

245
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:39,083
Thought I'd get a firsthand look
at this big ol' scary city.

246
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:42,000
Gotta say I'm disappointed
with how tame it is.

247
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:44,416
I mean, if a sexy girl like
you feels safe enough

248
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,208
to go out drinkin' on her own.

249
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:49,875
Well, it can't be too
dangerous then, right?

250
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:51,958
[CHAIN] Actually, that's
where you'd be wrong.

251
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:54,833
I always find a big,
strong man to protect me.

252
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:55,916
[chuckles]

253
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,750
Well, that's one thing
we're good for.

254
00:12:57,833 --> 00:13:02,458
Well, here's to meeting new
people. Have a drink on me.

255
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:04,208

Thank you.

00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:07,125
A gal after my own heart!

258
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:09,333
[CHAIN]
I won't lie, I do like to drink.

259
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:11,541
How about a game?

260
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,083
If you can drink
more than I do,

261
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:15,458
you can do anything
you want with me.

262
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:18,041
Anything.

263
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:19,458
You're on!

264
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:20,666
Hey, outsider.

265
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,416
Do you really think
you can outdrink her?

266
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,666
Or are ya bluffin'?

267

What the hell is it to you?

I got a hundred on Chain!

kinda booze is this?

Don't tell me these freaks
drink this shit every night.

Every noise is like an atomic
explosion in my skull!

Well, Jim and I were first
introduced at the theater.

Oh, you're so gauche.

order by the Maxium Milligan.

Vavradugo-based quiche yet?

Yep.

low on beer? I got it.

Is this some kinda party game?

[ELLEN]
Sorry, but the party's over.

299
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:08,875
Although you, Steven Alan
Starphase, member of Libra,

300
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:11,041
are invited to leave with us.

301
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:12,958
If you refuse, we'll
just have to kill you

302
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:14,166
and take your brain.

303
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,166
Well, and your flesh and bones.

304
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,833
A little postmortem doggy bag.

305
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:22,041
[STARPHASE] Hmm, sorry, I'm
afraid you've got the wrong guy.

306
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:23,125
Furthermore, Ellen.

307
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:25,166
I thought I'd
introduced you to Larry

308
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,500
for the very first
time this evening.

309
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:29,375
But if you already
knew each other,

310
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:32,250
well, now, that would've been...

311
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:33,791
...really fucking rude.

You're unbelievable.

314
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:38,958
Easiest thing to do would've
been to riddle me with holes

315
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:40,375
without a word.

316
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:42,875
So you were ordered
to take me alive, huh?

317
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:44,250
Who the hell is your boss?

318
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:47,541
'Cause they gave you an
incredibly foolish mission.

319
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:49,791
Do you really expect
us to tell you that?

320
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:52,333
[STARPHASE] 'Course not.
I just wish I could thank them.
