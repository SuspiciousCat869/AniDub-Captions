00:00:20,583 --> 00:00:23,333
[VELVED] Well, well, well!
Hello, General Gahnen.

3
00:00:23,416 --> 00:00:25,958
I had a funny feeling you'd
be calling me about now.

4
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:27,666
[GAHNEN]
Cut the horse shit!

5
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,583
Is this intel about the werewolf
squad incursion authentic?

6
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:32,166
[VELVED laughs]

7
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:33,958
[VELVED] The rumors have
been lighting up the Alternet

8
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:39,041
for a whole three minutes
now, so it must be true.

9
00:00:39,125 --> 00:00:41,875
It's also highly likely
the intel was leaked

10
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:43,666
by the werewolves themselves.

11
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,083
[GAHNEN]
Why the hell would they do that?

12
00:00:45,166 --> 00:00:47,208
[VELVED] No reason for
them to keep it a secret.

13
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:49,958
And, of course, they want you
to know they're coming for you.

14
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:52,583
It's more fun for them that way.

15
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:54,166
[VELVED laughs]

16
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:56,416
[VELVED] I'd back against
a wall if I were you.

17
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,125
They're probably
already in your room.

18
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,500
[KLAUS] The intersection between
two worlds. Hellsalem's Lot.

19
00:01:20,583 --> 00:01:24,208
Libra, a secret society of super
humans toiling in the shadows

20
00:01:24,291 --> 00:01:27,291
to preserve the fractured
balance between worlds.

21
00:01:27,375 --> 00:01:29,958
These are the records
of our covert missions.

22
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:03,000
[DELIMID] So, the five of you
managed to let loose

23
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:07,833
a total of 94 rounds...
and every one of them missed?!

24
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:10,166
That takes some real talent!

25
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,333
Wow! Thanks for saying so!

26
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:13,958
We'll do even better
on the next job!

27
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:15,583
Yeah, sorry about that.

28
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:17,375
[DELIMID growls]

29
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:18,583
Well, hey.

30
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:20,375
If you're not happy,
you handle the next one.

31
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:21,666
[DELIMID]
What was that?!

32
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,041
Killing is unnecessary
for a show of force.

33
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:26,458
Scare tactics work just fine.

34
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:28,625
[OLGA]
I...

35
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:29,458
...need a drink.

36
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:30,625
[growls]

37
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:33,125
[OGAMU] Now, now,
take a breath, Delimid.

38
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:35,916
Espionage has been the only
focus of our agency so far,

39
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,791
and it should remain that way.

40
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:40,791
If you want my feelings on this,
despite their natural skills,

41
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:43,416
I don't believe these ladies
were intended to be assassins.

42
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,125
Yeah!

43
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:45,583
Precisely stated, Chief!

44
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:46,833
Suck it, Delimid!

45
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:48,750
[DELIMID]
That's uncalled for!

46
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:51,916
See ya, Chain!

47
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,166
[OLGA]
Good work today!

48
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,833
Right back at ya!

49
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:56,375
[JANET]
Great job!

50
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:03,000
[MI-YEON]
Hey, Chain!

51
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:06,250
[MI-YEON]
Chain, hang on!

52
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:10,708
Hey, Chain! Will you
please wait a second?

53
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:13,375
[yelping]

54
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:16,291
[CHAIN] Still haven't made
your mind up yet, have you?

55
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:19,291
About your token, I mean.
Isn't that what you wanna ask?

56
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:21,333
[MI-YEON]
Well, yeah.

57
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:23,125
[CHAIN]
You need to make a decision.

58
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:24,958
It's pretty damn important.

59
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:27,333
[MI-YEON] Trust me, I know.
It's just that--

60
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:30,916
I guess I'm still kinda
figuring out who I am, y'know?

61
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,125
It's super hard to pin
down one single thing

62
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:36,250
I care about so much that
it ties me to reality.

63
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:39,875
I mean, for Emelina,
it's gotta be her kid, right?

64
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:42,625
For Olga, I'm guessing
it's alcohol.

65
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:44,875
And then Janet,
well, it's probably--

66
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:47,291
Gonna stop you right there.

67
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:49,541
It's against the rules
to pry like that.

68
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:51,333
Our tokens are crucial,

69
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:55,125
and they can even be
fatal if they're misused.

70
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:56,458
So...

71
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:58,625
Sorry, kid, no way in hell
I'm gonna tell you mine.

72
00:04:58,708 --> 00:04:59,625
[MI-YEON]
Aww.

73
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:00,916
[CHAIN]
Bye, now.

74
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,833
Oh, come one, Chain,
please help me out here!

75
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:11,916
[LEO]
Come on!

76
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,166
How is it possible that you
forget every single time?

77
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,833
[NEJ chuckles]

78
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:19,541
[LEO] Don't give me that
"heh-heh-heh" crap!

79
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:21,708
I've been waiting here
for a full five hours!

80
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,916
I'm lucky I noticed
you happen to pass by.

81
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,083
No telling how long
I would've been here.

82
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:27,458
[NEJ chuckles]

83
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:30,083
"Heh-heh-heh!" Stop laughing!

84
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:33,250
Look, just get a
cellphone, all right?

85
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:37,916
[NEJ] But, Leo...
I can't buy a cellphone.

86
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,291
If I had that kinda money,
I'd just-- I would buy...

87
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,208
I'd buy burgers!

88
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:48,125
[LEO] You don't think I know
that?! You have zero willpower!

89
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:51,791
All right, that's it!
No burgers for you tomorrow!

90
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:53,583
[NEJ screams]

91
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:55,333
[LEO] Take the day
to learn consideration

92
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:57,208
and how to be on time!

93
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:03,500
[NEJ]
Bur-- Bu. Bu. Bu. Bu. Bu.

94
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:08,000
Burgers!

95
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:13,166
No, please. Burgers!

96
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:18,000
Bu. Bu. Burger.
Ha-Hamburger. Eat. Eat.

97
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:23,041
A hamburger. Uh?

98
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:23,791
Huh?

99
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:25,333
[CHAIN laughs]

100
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:27,958
[CHAIN] You there, the fat
little mushroom fellow.

101
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:30,541
Are you a friend of
Leonardo Watch's?

102
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:31,916
Yeah! I am!

103
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,791
Bur-Leo-ger ham-Watch-burger
is my bestest friend

104
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:37,875
in the whole wide world!

105
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:40,541
That's a terrible mnemonic
device for remembering his name,

106
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:43,041
but whatever works, I guess.

107
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:45,916
Life can be difficult
for the forgetful.

108
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,833
A string of missed opportunities
and inscrutable tribulations.

109
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:52,125
I wonder what's takin'
bur-Leo-ger so long.

110
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:52,958
[CHAIN]
Hey!

111
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:55,166
[NEJ]
Huh?

112
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,958
Holy crap, your memory
is nonexistent.

113
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:00,125
Write the stuff you need
to remember in that pad

114
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:01,666
and carry it with you.

115
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,750
Right, I will! Brilliant!

116
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:05,750
Hey, who are you, by the way?

117
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:08,333
Uh?

118
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:09,666
For the time being,

119
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,916
you may refer to me as
the spirit of hamburgers.

120
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,833
[NEJ]
Huh?!

121
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:17,458
Would you like fries with that?

122
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:20,041
[CHAIN] Well, that had a
terrifying effect on him.

123
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:22,875
Maybe I should've chosen
a different identity.

124
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:28,875
[phone ringing]

125
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:30,291
Chain here.

126
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:32,208
[STARPHASE] Hey, good work
today. You off the clock?

127
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:33,500
Yep.

128
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:34,875
It went off without a hitch.

129
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:36,833
I doubt the general will
try to move forward

130
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:40,083
with his Blood Breed soldier
program after this.

131
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:41,583
Pretty sure he got the message.

132
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:43,041
Well, let's hope so.

133
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:46,541
Hang on a sec. Schedule's
pretty clear today.

134
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:48,791
Why don't you head on home
and get some rest?

135
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:50,583
[CHAIN]
Sounds good to me.

136
00:07:56,541 --> 00:08:01,500
[CHAIN humming]

137
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:20,583
[sighs]

138
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:25,500
[CHAIN] Aw, dammit.
Did I just pop a button?

139
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:31,083
Whatever. Forget it.
I've gotta... brush my teeth...

140
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:34,250
[door opens]

141
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:36,708
Hey. Any new developm--?

142
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,833
I'm guessing you got bad news.

143
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,500
Yeah.

144
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:50,250
[VELVED] The so-called
invisible werewolves.

145
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:54,333
They currently exist everywhere,
and yet they exist nowhere.

146
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:56,083
That is the state
of their being.

147
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:57,416
[GAHNEN]
Enough with the riddles!

148
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,416
I'm asking how the hell
they were able to bypass

149
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,375
my mansion's panoptic
security system!

150
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,666
Five of them, just
appearing like ghosts.

151
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,541
[VELVED] Fifty experienced
guards, infrared alarms,

152
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:11,875
thermal sensors, motion
detectors, etcetera, etcetera.

153
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:13,416
[VELVED sighs]

154
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,916
[VELVED] Sorry to tell you,
but that's child's play to them.

155
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,416
[GAHNEN]
How is that possible?!

156
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,791
[VELVED] Although they're
referred to as "invisible,"

157
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:21,750
their stealth far exceeds
optical parameters.

158
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:25,916
Their shape, weight,
temperature, physicality, odor,

159
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
hell, even their very causality,

160
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:31,083
they can diminish every single
aspect of their existence

161
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:33,000
to an infinitesimal degree.

162
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:36,083
In other words, they can
alter reality to only exist

163
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:39,500
where and when they want to.

164
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,958
But don't you worry.

165
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:42,375
There are very few
of them in the world

166
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:45,000
and their powers
are not boundless.

167
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:47,291
Once they return to
their human form,

168
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:50,708
you can kill them
like any other person.

169
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:52,000
You're certain of that?

[CHAIN] Hey, Gilbert,
got you a little gift.

176
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:21,708
[GILBERT] Mm. A most impressive
vase. Lovely choice.

177
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:25,541
You do have a rather exquisite
eye for appurtenances, Chain.

178
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:26,916
I can pick out a vase,

179
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,333
just don't ask me to arrange
the flowers, though.

180
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:32,291
But ya got no problems
rearranging my face, she-bitch!

Yes, this is Chain.

197

Sounds urgent.

198
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:14,791
[DELIMID] These images were
captured three hours ago.

199
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:16,833
It's one of the country's
eight missile bases,

200
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:19,291
and it's currently on
standby to launch.

201
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:20,833
The target is unknown.

202
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:23,083
But the intel we've received
from various sources

203
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:25,416
cites "BB virus warheads."

204
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,958
"BB"? As in Blood Breed?

205
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:31,916
[DELIMID]
Let's try to avoid conjecture.

206
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,916
Although, given the
country's attempts

207
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
to manufacture vampire soldiers,

208
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:38,125
we can't rule out
the possibility.

209
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:39,458
Um, Delimid?

210
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:40,750
Yes, Emilina?

211
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:43,458
I'm 99% certain this is a trap.

212
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:45,208
And I agree.

213
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:48,416
But we still can't risk not
doing anything about it either.

214
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,583
Especially since we're the only
ones who can do something.

215
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:55,916
This is the floorplan
of the base.

216
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,583
The missile control mainframe
is housed in the central room

217
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:01,708
with four backups
surrounding it.

218
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:03,708
If even one of the
hubs goes down,

219
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:05,500
the system will
immediately crosscheck

220
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:08,416
with the other terminals
and reboot itself.

221
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,291
So your only option
is to take down

222
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:12,500
the four backups simultaneously.

223
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:14,833
The central system will
then be left vulnerable

224
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:16,541
for you to disable it.

225
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:19,375
One question.
How are we getting in?

226
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:22,125
[JANET] There don't appear
to be any infiltration routes.

227

No, there is one.

They're not expecting

If we weren't anticipating
their interference,

00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:47,500
all of this would look just
like a normal malfunction.

[DELIMID]
Uh! Are you serious?

250
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:26,875
[OGAMU] Well, she has certainly
changed her appearance

251
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:29,708
since her time spent with
the Werewolf Bureau.

252

Makes sense.

Dammit!

255
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I knew we should've killed her
when we had the chance.

256
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:39,625
[KLAUS] So she's still aiming
to take down the werewolves?

257
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:41,916
I don't see how she
possibly could.

258
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,250
Due to the level of injuries she
sustained in our last battle,

259
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:48,500
she no longer possesses the
ears, eyes, or nose it takes

to even detect another werewolf.

There it is. Motive.

just under two weeks ago now.

closed a transaction on that day

in the recesses of
Hellsalem's Lot.

266
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:09,708
The merchant in question...
was Zeodra the Heretic.

267
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:13,208
Among the 13 Kings, he's proven
to be the most mercurial.

Tottering between
madness and lucidity,

269
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:17,333
his senses are
constantly bombarded

00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:20,125
with the deluge of light,
sound, and vibration

flooding through all
of Hellsalem's Lot.

272

Zeodra's ubiquitary sensitivity,

Velved Rheinkeimer will
find the werewolves.

Unless you go so far as to
wipe out your existence,

you to ruin this for me!

fate for yourselves.

along with my plan,

get my hands on Chain.

I ever cared much
for the young lady.

better than everyone else.

00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:27,750
[CHAIN]
Nope. No way. Nu-uh.

316
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:31,208
So you want me to prove how
much better I am than you?

317
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:33,833
Let's head for the
horizon of causality.

318
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:35,916
Try to catch me if you can!

319
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,875
Existence Dilute!

320
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:51,916
Don't do it.

321
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:59,166
[VELVED] 1st Sensitivity.
2nd Sensitivity.

322
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,291
3rd Sensitivity!

323
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:06,541
Where the hell are you?
Dammit. Time to go deeper.

324
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:08,708
4th Sensitivity!

325
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:23,041
Where are you?!

326
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:26,000
Dammit, you bitch,
where the hell are you?

327
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:32,833
Still no sign. How much did that
crazy mongrel dilute herself?

328
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:35,041
[gasps]

329
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:37,000
[VELVED]
Now I've got you!

330
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:43,791
[VELVED]
She dissolved even further.

331
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:45,375
Don't tell me...

332
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:48,958
Did she stick her tail out
just to rub it in my face?

333
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:55,125
[VELVED]
Nobody mocks me!

334
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:58,041
13th Sensitivity!

335
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:07,041
[EMILINA]
Chain. You gotta stop!

336
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:09,583
Any further and you
won't make it back.

337
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:13,916
Please, don't. It'll be like
you never even existed!

338
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,791
[VELVED yells]

339
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:37,583
[VELVED] What the hell? Is this
the only thing left of her?

340
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:39,541
[VELVED screams]

341
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:02,166
[EMILINA] Casper 1 to HQ.
Plan B achieved.

342
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:05,125
Repeat. Plan B achieved.

343
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:08,166
Team status.
Casper 4 is missing.

344
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:11,083
Requesting Emergency
Salvage Protocol.

345
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:21,625
[groaning]

346
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:28,041
[GILBERT]
Good morning, Zapp.

347
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:30,166
I don't really see what's
so good about it.

348
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,083
[GILBERT] Would you care for
me to brew a pot of coffee?

349
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:34,208
[ZAPP]
Sure. Brew two pots.

350
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:36,375
[LEO] I can't believe
you're late again!

351
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:38,458
I told you to figure out
a way to fix this!

352
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:40,208
[NEJ chuckles]

353
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,333
[STARPHASE]
Token? What the hell is that?

354
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:45,875
I'm not following
you at all here.

355
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:47,541
You don't have to understand.

356
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:49,416
Just follow the
directions, okay?

357
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,708
That token expresses
Chain's most ardent need

358
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:53,041
for her existence.

359
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:55,750
It's her strongest tie
to this reality,

360
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:59,750
and her 100%, fail-safe,
pure reason to return.

361
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:01,958
Wait, this is her reason?

362
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:08,458
Hold on, what am I
doing here again?

363
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,166
[DELIMID grunting]

364
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,791
Ohh. That's right.

365
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:20,083
[STARPHASE] Better get
this over with quickly.

366
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:22,458
Just do it exactly as written.

367
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:26,208
Um, hello, there, Chain!

368
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:29,291
I've come to visit you!

369
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:33,750
[CHAIN grunting]

370
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:36,541
Um. Okay.

371
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:45,375
[CHAIN screaming]

372
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:48,583
[LEO screams]

373
00:21:48,666 --> 00:21:50,083
[LEO]
You got here before me?!

374
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:52,708
And I'm running
15 minutes early!

375
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:55,041
[ZAPP]
Whoa, hey, Steven.

376
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:57,750
What the hell
happened to you, man?

377
00:21:57,833 --> 00:22:00,083
Y'know, Zapp,
just don't even ask.

378
00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:02,458
Actually, great question,
please do ask.

379
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:04,125
[ZAPP]
So, which is it?

380
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:05,666
[STARPHASE] I only went over
to Chain's apartment

381
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,458
and did as I was told, and this?

382
00:22:07,541 --> 00:22:11,958
This is the result! So you
explain to me what happened!

383
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:13,541
[ZAPP]
Heh?

384
00:23:54,416 --> 00:23:55,833
[GILBERT]
"Quarrels should be avoided."

385
00:23:55,916 --> 00:23:58,541
And that most certainly
applies to this city.

386
00:23:58,625 --> 00:24:01,666
The direct approach is likely
to lead to your own defeat.

387
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:03,708
That is why I always
choose to make a point

388
00:24:03,791 --> 00:24:05,500
of hanging several steps back.

389
00:24:05,583 --> 00:24:08,500
And it can appear
intimidating as well.
