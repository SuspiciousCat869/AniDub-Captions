and I looked into his eyes.

161
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:31,750
And I loved him
with all my heart.

162
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:33,916
And now, here he is.

163
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,375
Spending his days without
me and talking with kids

164
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:39,375
I've never even met before.

165
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:41,208
It's all so amazing.

166
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:42,541
[beeping]

167
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:45,083
[GRAHAM]
Emergency! Emergency!

168
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:48,166
We walked right into an ambush.
They've got us pinned down!

169
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:55,083
[GRAHAM] I'm counting 12
armored, mechanized beasts!

170
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:57,416
Clear the room for us, K.K.!

171
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:24,875
[GRAHAM gasps]

172
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,791
[GRAHAM]
Ha-ha! You saved us again.

173
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:34,208
[GRAHAM]
I owe you a cold one.

174
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:37,208
You're the goddamn best, K.K.!

175
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:39,916
[sighs]

176
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:43,125
[ALAN]
Very well, then.

177
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:47,666
Right, just call me back if the
situation changes in any way.

178
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:48,875
Hm?

179
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:51,166
Hey, um, where did everyone go?

180
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,166
[ALAN]
They moved on to the next class.

181
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,208
They only just left
a moment ago.

182
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:57,250
C'mon, I'll show you the way.

183
00:10:58,625 --> 00:10:59,958
[K.K.]
Can't escape work, huh?

184
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:02,541
[ALAN]
Yeah, no rest for the wicked.

185
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:05,541
My job has been
absolute murder lately.

186
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:06,791
And with everything going on,

187
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:09,125
I really shouldn't
even be here today.

188
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:10,416
I tried to back out,

189
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,375
but my daughter broke down
crying and screaming

190
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:14,666
how I don't love her,
so y'know...

191
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,416
I've been on the
same guilt trip.

192
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,708
Yeah? You too, huh?

193
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:25,083
Hey! Where'd you disappear to?

194
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:26,791
I had to use the restroom.

195
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:28,541
[KANE]
If you say so.

196
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:30,416
But you better not be lying
so you can run off

197
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,041
for more work stuff again.

198
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:35,333
[K.K.]
What? No, of course not!

199
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:37,041
Uh, so what's up next?

200
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:40,000
[KANE] A biology lesson
in the science lab.

201
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:41,958
[K.K.] They keep you
really busy, don't they?

202
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:44,875
[KANE] I guess.
It's like this every day.

203
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:46,083
[CAROLINE gasps]

204
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:49,666
Hey, Kane. That lady's
your mom, right?

205
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,875
Maybe.

206
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:54,125
Not like it's any of
your business, though.

207
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:55,916
Well, I think she
looks pretty cool.

208
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,916
Huh? She's the exact
opposite of cool!

209
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,625
She's always freaking out
over every stupid thing.

210
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:03,916
And always crying.

211
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,250
[K.K.]
And what's this?

212
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:07,916
Is this what I think it is?

213
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,041
I'm dying here. They are just
the most adorable pair ever!

214
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:14,500
A girlfriend?
Is she a girlfriend?

215
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:18,666
Does my baby boy already
have a girlfriend? Ah!

216
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,500
Way to go, little guy.

217
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:21,708
Your older brother's so aloof.

218
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:23,291
Who knows what's
going on with him.

219
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:27,208
But I've got high hopes for you
in the department of romance.

220
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:32,791
[K.K.] Oh, my God! She's so
precious! And so pretty!

221
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:35,500
I know you'll hate it, but I'm
holding a press conference

222
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:37,041
the second we get home!

223
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:40,458
Your mama can't control herself,
the whole world has to know!

224
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:42,875
Wait, is the video
camera charged up?

225
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:44,625
This is a moment that
demands image and sou--

226
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:46,375
[GRAHAM]
K.K.!

227
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:47,958
We managed to
rendezvous with Steven,

228
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:49,791
but the enemy's got
us cornered again!

229
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:51,708
We need immediate relief!

230
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:53,500
K.K.!

231
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:55,291
[growls]

232
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:08,500
[STARPHASE]
Thank you, K.K.

233
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:13,416
[STARPHASE]
Whoa. Too much, K.K.!

234
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:17,500
I said we're good!
Hold your fire!

235
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:41,791
[gasps]

236
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,708
[STARPHASE]
What the hell is that?

237
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:50,541
[K.K.] Steven! Turn around
and run right now!

238
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:52,291
Only thing I can see
on my monitor

239
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:55,375
is what looks like thin air
holding my missile in place!

240
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:02,958
[STARPHASE]
Son of a bitch.

241
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:06,083
I've confirmed it.
That's a Blood Breed.

242
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:16,708
[K.K.] There's no way to target
an enemy via remote feed

243
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:19,333
when the bastard doesn't
even show up in mirrors.

244
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:20,958
I've gotta do this in person.

245
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:24,041
I'm sorry, Kane.
Please don't hate me.

246
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:32,083
[clapping]

247
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:34,125
[BOSS]
Most impressive, maestro.

248
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:36,916
Effective and nightmarish
in equal measure.

249
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,791
[BOSS laughing]

250
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:40,333
Hey! Dumb asses!

251
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:42,791
You must be draggin' some
giant balls behind you

252
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:46,750
to come chargin' into
Brigade Argento's place!

253
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:49,833
But that ambition of
yours just screwed ya.

254
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:51,250
You've made it this far,

255
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:54,666
but not one of you is
walkin' any further.

256
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,625
And you're not
walkin' out either.

257
00:14:56,708 --> 00:15:01,500
[laughing]

258
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:07,708
[KANE]
Huh?

259
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:10,083
Jeez, did you have to
go the bathroom agai--?

260
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:14,125
[K.K.]
I love you.

261
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:16,666
Nothing could be
more true than that.

262
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:23,333
[KANE] So I guess you're gonna
abandon me, after all.

263
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:27,083
Y'know what, you're
a terrible mother!

264
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:28,875
That's not true at all!

265
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:30,166
You don't know.

266
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,958
You have no idea
how much it hurts

267
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:33,500
for you to hate me like this,

268
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:34,833
but it's fine.

269
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:38,458
I can live with it because
I'm keeping you safe!

270
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:40,041
I'll see you soon.

271
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:42,250
[KANE] Wait, what does that even
mean, you're keeping me safe?

272
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:44,083
I'm conducting a "hero
interview" with you

273
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:46,041
when I get home tonight.

274
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:48,541
So you better be prepared.

275
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:50,083
Hey, hang on, Mom!

276
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:52,000
Oh, no! Don't tell
me you're leaving.

277
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:54,833
Afraid so, I've been
called into work.

278
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:15,708
[K.K.] Well this
certainly sucks a fat one.

279
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:17,958
It's disgusting how
careless I've been.

280
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:19,875
I've spent the entire
day with this guy.

281
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:23,958
How many chances have I missed
to notice the telltale signs?

282
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:26,375
This is what I get for
being in a good mood.

283
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:28,000
Agh! Dammit.

284
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:31,333
Is taking a simple parents' day
really too much to ask?

285
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:33,583
[ALAN] Hey, I'll be
right back, Caroline.

286
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:36,666
I'm stepping out for a smoke.
The craving's too strong.

287
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:39,583
[CAROLINE] Huh? But, Dad, our
next class is about to start.

288
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:42,708
Yeah, sorry.
I'll be back in a flash.

289
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:49,583
No choice but to use
Esmerelda Blood Freeze.

290
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:55,166
[STARPHASE]
Espada del Cero Absoluto!

291
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:17,416
[BOSS]
Well, not too shabby.

292
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,125
That move would've made
a puddle out of most men.

293
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:22,041
You're actually a pretty
formidable match

294
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,541
against the maestro here.

295
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:27,291
The maestro?
Don't make me laugh.

296
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:29,750
Seriously, a Blood
Breed bodyguard?

297
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:32,500
What kinda idiot would
think that's a good idea?

298
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:35,333
What'd you call m--?

299
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:38,125
[ALAN] You really couldn't have
chosen a more inconvenient day

300
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:42,458
to spring this encounter
on me, fang hunter.

301
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:44,291
I imagine you're
feared far and wide

302
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:47,875
for your mastery of the
Esmerelda Blood Freeze style.

303
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:51,541
Regardless, you'll never be
able to take me on your own.

304
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:53,583
I can't let you
call in for help.

305
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:56,250
So I'll have to
kill you quickly.

306
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:04,375
[K.K.] Get your hands up.
Or I put you down.

307
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:07,500
[ALAN] Well, this is weird.
And I'm hoping it's a joke.

308
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:10,000
Kind of a messed up
one since we just met.

309
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:12,958
[K.K.]
Quit acting so normal, monster.

310
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:14,791
Y'know, I had
a sneaking suspicion

311
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:16,708
I've been missing
something all day.

312
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:18,916
You're another fang hunter, huh?

313
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:19,666
