This is pretty rare for him.

00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:30,208
He never warms up to people
as quickly as he has with you.

00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:31,833
[RIEL]
That's because he's smart.

9
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:34,000
It's better to be apprehensive
than to get eaten.

10

And evasion's the sole survival
tactic of sonic speed monkeys.

But he can tell I'm no threat.

00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:44,375
Even a monkey can see
I'm pathetically weak.

No, I'm pretty sure he
just likes you, Riel!

I think I deserve the
right to vent, though.

[KLAUS] Well, what can I say?
The man reveres cubism.

78
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,750
It just felt wrong to let him
miss this visiting Cezanne.

79
00:05:57,833 --> 00:06:00,083
[ALICE] His taste in art
is beside the point.

80
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:01,625
He's a double-S class prisoner

under constant Dreadnought
level supervision.

82
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,208
Allowing him to visit
a goddamn museum

83
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:07,833
completely contradicts that.

[KLAUS] Trust me, Warden,
I understand your concern.

85

That is why we took
the proper precautions.

I even had them clear
the building for the day.

[ALICE] That's all very well and
good for the public at large,

88
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:18,833
but still, it doesn't
do anything for me.

89
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:21,583
This little fieldtrip
interferes with my duties.

90
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:23,125
And that's what pisses me off.

91
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:24,958
I am terribly sorry for that.

92
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:27,708

just consider it a reward

You're talking about

[LI GADO]
No, no, you have it backward.

113
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:25,000
The bacterium is the terrorist.

114
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:26,791
He goes by the name Gemnemo.

115
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:30,416
He's a fully cognizant and
aggressively active being.

Hmm.

118
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,583
This is really silly.
But then again, here I am.

119
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,750
Having a perfectly
fluent conversation

120
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:42,291
with a tech-savvy flea.

121
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:43,250
[LI GADO]
What flea?

122
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:44,833
Oh, you mean this!

123
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:48,416
It's just an exosuit to shield
me from your atmosphere.

124
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,166
Heh?! Whoa, hang on.

125
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,041
Are you saying
you're even smaller?

126
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:55,083
[LI GADO] Much smaller.
I'm a microbe, too, after all.

127
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:56,791
But the only thing we
should be discussing

128
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:59,750
is how I can promptly find
Gemnemo and arrest him.

129
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:02,000
Not only is he a
sociopathic genius,

130
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:05,166
he's the first bacterium
to master sorcerology.

131
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,666
And according to
our latest intel,

132
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,625
he's developed a
hyper-augmented method

133
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:11,416
for accelerated
cytological division.

Huh.

135
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:15,333
[LI GADO]
If we don't apprehend him,

136
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:18,458
it'll result in catastrophe.

137
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:21,666
However, there is still hope.

138

139
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:26,708

140
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:29,666
so it must be repaired.

00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,750
You mean, the thing that
slammed into my head,

142
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:34,791
and then shattered like
a cheap, shoddy toy?

but do you think your monkey

Hey, are you certain about this?

00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:13,083
This isn't the first time we've
retrieved stuff from down there.

158
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:15,458
It's no sweat with
me navigating.

159
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:18,333
[LI GADO]
How exactly does that work? Hm?

160
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,666
Take a left there. Good.
Now start heading down.

161
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:34,750
That's it. Just keep
on moving down.

162
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:41,708
[meowing]

163
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:43,041
[LANDLADY A]
Thank you so much.

164
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:44,541
[LEO]
No problem at all,

165
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:47,125
and thank you again
for the extension!

166
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:49,458
[LI GADO]
So that's your trick.

167
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:52,833
You were able to guide him
with those eyes of yours.

168
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:54,500
That's it, right?

169
00:09:57,208 --> 00:09:59,041
[LEO]
Mmm. Yeah.

170
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:06,541
[ZAPP]
Huh?

171
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:08,791
Hey, uh, you. I know you.

172
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:11,083
Oh. Yeah, you work with Leo.

173
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:12,500
[ZAPP]
Hm?

174
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:15,083
Look at you!

175
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:16,458
You've been bulkin'
up the old guns

176
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:18,625
since the last time I saw you.

177
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:20,958
Um, I have?

178
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:23,166
Now that I've said
somethin' nice.

179
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,166
[ZAPP chuckles]

180
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,833
How 'bout you do me
a friendly solid

181
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:28,666
and let me borrow 20 bucks?

182
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:31,250
I'll get Leo to pay you back
the next time you guys hang out.

183
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:32,083
[RIEL]
Well, I--

184
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:36,666
C'mon. Help me out! Please?

185
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:37,875
[ZAPP screams]

186
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:41,000
[ZAPP screams]

187
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:12,083
[GEMNEMO]
You speak the truth, my friend.

188
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:14,833
Power's the only thing that
matters in this world.

189
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:18,250
So many people get trampled
into the ground, and for what?

190
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:20,250
Just so the powerful
can pile them up

191
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:23,458
and stand on their broken
backs to enjoy a better view.

192
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:25,250
And for someone as frail as you?

193
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:26,916
There's really no
hope for crawling out

194
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,833
from beneath that
helpless mound.

195
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:30,166
And climbing up
is nothing more

196
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:33,833
than a dream within a dream.

197
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:37,416
Tell me, friend. You long
to see it, don't you?

198
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,791
Go on, be honest, now.
This is just between us.

199
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:42,375
You'd like to see it, right?

200
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:45,250
For just once in your
miserable, little life,

201
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:48,625
don't you want to enjoy
the view from the top?

202
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,291
[footsteps]

203
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:55,500
[RIEL]
Hm?

204
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:58,666
Well, look who it is.

205
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:02,875
Y'know it's rude to just cower
instead of sayin' hello, right?

206
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,333
[NUZRUBA laughs]

207
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:11,000
[RIEL screams]

208
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,333
[ALL gasping]

209
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:31,166
[LI GADO]
I've finally finished it!

210
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,375
[LI GADO] The viral aggression
surgical strike cannon.

211
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:40,833
The Fuldra Radrict
Huvaserganon 7000-AR!

212
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:43,666
I can neutralize 99%
of the Gemnemo threat

213
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,041
with this beauty here!

214
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:48,541
Oh! Feast your eyes upon
the mighty spear of justice!

215
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:50,000
That's gonna save the world?

216
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:52,416
It looks like it came out
of a Gundam model kit.

217
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,916
[LI GADO]
It's not a toy!

218
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,208
It is built from the refuse
of my first weapon, though,

219
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:59,666
so unpredictability is a factor.

220
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,041
I've put in a request
with my headquarters,

221
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:04,666
but my regular gear, the
Grag Gigaramd Vedabalson,

222
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,375
is apparently still
undergoing its own repairs.

223
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:08,833
Then what's your plan here?

224
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:11,291
You've got a weapon but you
don't know if it'll work?

225
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:13,666
[LI GADO] The two of us will
just have to do the best we can.

226
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:14,958
[grumbles]

227
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:19,000
It's all up to you and me!

228
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:20,500
About that.

229
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:22,625
What makes you so certain
I'm getting mixed up in this?

230
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:24,166
[LI GADO]
Are you deaf?

231
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,458
I told you the fate of your
world hangs in the balance here!

232
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:27,958
Right.

233
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:29,708
[LI GADO] What's with the
dismissive, patronizing tone?

234
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:31,125
Well, basically,

235
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:33,333
you act like this thing's
a doomsday weapon,

236
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:35,625
but it already lost in
the battle against my head

237
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:37,708
and it barely left a bump on me.

238
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:40,750
So your fate-of-the-world talk
feels a bit disproportionate.

239
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:42,041
[LI GADO]
Unbelievable!

240
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:44,041
That right there is the
problem with you giants!

241
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:45,833
You only worry about
things bigger than you!

242
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:47,416
Wait, giant?

243
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,083
Well that's the only time in my
life anyone's called me that.

244
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:52,916
It's usually "little dude,"
or "runt," or "pipsqueak."

245
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,458
And then they rub my
head or push me down.

246
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:57,625
[LI GADO] That's the exact
behavior I'm talking about!

247
00:13:57,708 --> 00:14:00,250
Strength doesn't determine
the outcome of every fight!

248
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:03,541
So don't you go and judge
everything by the same metric!

249
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:06,833
[STARPHASE] So, you thought
it best to bring him here?

250
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:09,833
[LEO] Yeah. You haven't
heard any news, have you?

251
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:13,458
Y'know, about any threats to
the city? Apocalypse type stuff?

252
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:14,916
Well, yeah, of course.

253
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,166
Apocalyptic threats are like

254
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,875
the everyday background
music to this city.

255
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:20,333
Hm.

256
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:21,583
It's not all that relevant,

257
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:24,291
but I just got word that
Zapp was hospitalized.

258
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:25,708
[LEO]
Huh?

259
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,333
He got in a fight and someone
tossed him into traffic.

260
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:28,708
[LEO]
How does that even happen?

261
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:30,166
[STARPHASE sighs]

262
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,750
Nothing that guy does
makes any sense to me.

263
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:36,000
So then, this, uh,
hyper-augmented method

264
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:39,125
for accelerated cytological
division you were mentioning.

265
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:41,333
Can you explain that to me?

266
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:42,875
[LI GADO]
In the broadest of terms,

267
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:45,958
it's a method for enlarging and
strengthening living tissue.

268
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:49,083
He first performs the procedure
on a target microbe,

269
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:51,583
which is implanted in a subject,

270
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:54,208
where it then proceeds
to rapidly multiply.

271
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:55,708
Knowing Gemnemo, though,

272
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:58,500
he's out for more than the
amplification of muscle mass.

273
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:00,750
I'd wager it results in
the unbridled evolution

274
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:04,166
of the full physical structure,
skeleton and all.

275
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:07,166
[NUZRUBA screams]

276
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:11,083
Please! I'm so sorry!
Please forgive me!

277
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:13,000
Not so quickly, Nuzruba.

278
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:15,916
I've only broken one
measly pinky, after all.

279
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,166
Me, on the other hand,

280
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:21,375
my body was a web of
compound fractures!

281
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:23,916
Consider this a greatest
hits of your abuse.

282
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I want you to feel
every ounce of pain

283
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:28,166
that you've inflicted
on anyone in your life!

[NUZRUBA screams]

285
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,166
[GEMNEMO]
How's the view?

286
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,583
You've got a whole new
perspective, don't you?

287
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:40,166
It must be intoxicating to see
the world through new eyes.

288
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,833
The power's irresistible,
isn't it?

289
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:46,625
[GEMNEMO laughing]

290
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:52,333
Police, hold it! Hands
where I can see 'em! Huh?

291
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:55,375
Shit, that's just barbaric.

292
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:59,208
[RIEL] What I've done?
You call this barbaric?

293
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,750
Freeze, dammit!

294
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:07,166
[RIEL] If you could've only seen
what these monsters did to me

295
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:10,416
because that... was much worse.

296
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:20,083

297
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:34,333
[RIEL roars]

298
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:38,791
[BRODY] Well, I'm feeling
artistically fulfilled.

299
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:40,875
That Cezanne was lovely, huh?

300
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,125
[growls]

301
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:44,250
[BRODY] Oh, don't give
me that stupefied look.

302
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:46,708
Prisoners are capable of
appreciating something

303
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:48,791
other than pornography, y'know.

304
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:49,916
[ALICE]
Tch.

305
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,458
This interest in painting,

306
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:53,541
do the two of you
often discuss art?

307
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:56,041
[BRODY] Well, only about the
stuff we do and don't like.

308
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:57,458
Nothing too complex.

309
00:16:57,541 --> 00:17:00,208
This guy's not much for
debating theory and technique.

310
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:04,083
Yet you give him the materials,
he's actually quite skilled.

311
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:07,000
[KLAUS] Really?
I was completely unaware.

312
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:09,083
I'll have some art supplies
sent over for you.

313
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:11,250
You mean it? That's awesome!

314
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:13,875
[BRODY] Roll up a leaf green
Crayon and slip it in the pack,

315
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:15,166
if ya get my drift.

316
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,083
[HUMMER chuckles]

317
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:18,166
[BRODY]
Calm down, I'm joking.

318
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,208
[KLAUS]
Hm?

319
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:33,708
Whoa!

320
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:35,041
That was rad!

321
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:36,250
[bang]

322
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:41,250
[BOTH scream]

323
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:43,666
[HUMMER]
Exocrimson!

324
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,208
That's a catch and release!

325
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:54,291
[BRODY laughs]

326
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:56,250
Never thought I'd see the
day it's rainin' policesuits.

327
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:58,750
Weird, the weather
looks so nice.

328
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,041
[gasps]

329
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:15,791
[phone ringing]

330
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:17,166
[KLAUS]
It's me.

331
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,791
We have an emergency situation
on New Third Avenue.

332
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:21,708
An unidentified giant humanoid.

333
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:24,625
It's currently
engaging a swat team.

334
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:26,625
Alert all personnel
as a precaution.

335
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:30,083
DEFCON level 2. Prepare
for crisis mobilization!

336
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:38,208
[HUMMER]
Hm.

337
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:41,750
Hey, y'know, Klaus, seems like
we should give them a hand.

338
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:44,125
[KLAUS]
Warden?

339
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:45,750
Permission granted.

340
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,500
Put it down ASAP.

341
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:48,833
Understood.

342
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,541
Yee-hee-hee!

343
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:59,291
[KLAUS] Ah. By the way, Steven.
Leave a message for Gilbert.

344
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:01,750
Just to err on the
side of caution.

345
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:04,416
Tell him to please cancel
my schedule for tonight.

346
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,958
Exocrimson.

347
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:21,250
[STARPHASE]
It's 13 feet tall?

348
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:23,458
Near-human types tend
to get pretty big,

349
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:25,208
but that's still pretty
goddamn enormous.

350
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:26,250
[LEO]
Huh?!

351
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:27,541
Is that Riel?

352
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,750
Hang on. You know that thing?

353
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:33,333
[LEO] Well, I think so,
but not like that.

354
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:35,291
He normally weighs
less than I do.

355
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:36,958
[LI GADO]
Jackpot!

356
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:38,000
[LEO]
Ow!

357
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:40,833
[LI GADO] That's what
we've been looking for!

358
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:44,125
I'm sorry to tell you this, Leo,
but I am at least 80% positive

359
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:46,583
that your friend is now
a pathogenic terrorist.

360
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:49,708
Gemnemo's exposed him
to his procedure.

361
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:51,125
Huh?

362
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:52,708
[LI GADO]
His cellular tissue is splitting

363
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:54,541
at a hyper accelerated rate.

364
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:57,791
Just as muscles torn by exertion
create even thicker muscle,

365
00:19:57,875 --> 00:20:00,666
and broken bones are even
stronger once they mend.

366
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:03,583
This process is being endlessly
repeated within him,

367
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:07,041
resulting in unchecked
explosive bodybuilding!

368
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:10,875
[LEO] Right. So, um, what
are you trying to tell us?

369
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:13,166
[LI GADO] Physically confronting
him is the worst thing

370
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:14,625
one can possibly do.

371
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:17,250
It'll only increase
his savagery.

372
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:34,750
Brain Grid. Blood Battle
Technique. Form 1-1-7!

373
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:40,791
[KLAUS]
Unzerbrechlich Kreuzschild!

374
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:41,875
[BRODY grunts]

375
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:47,458
[STARPHASE]
Klaus!

376
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:49,541
Delicacy might be required
with this target!

377
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:51,750
Avoid undue engagement!

378
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,458
[KLAUS]
Just confirmed that.

379
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:54,750
I'm going to attempt
to restrain it.

380
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:58,166
[RIEL roars]

381
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:02,583
Let's try Brain Grid Blood
Battle Technique. Formation 39.

382
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:10,333
[KLAUS]
Keilbarrikade!

383
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:11,833
Warden Alice!

384
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:14,375
Take Hummer and the others
and move far away from here.

385
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:16,333
What the hell're you gonna do?!

386
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:19,458
[KLAUS] I'll stay right here
and contain the damage.

387
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:21,041
Steven.

388
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:23,750
I've never seen anything close
to this kind of power before.

389
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:25,833
Do you have any
further information?

390
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:27,708
I could use some input.

391
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:34,333
[KLAUS]
What? My God.

392
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:48,416
Look out, Klaus!
I'm comin' for ya!

393
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,666
[HUMMER]
Hundred Crack Fist of the Me!

394
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:14,416
[BEYONDER B]
Look!

395
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:56,000
[SONIC gibbering]

396
00:23:56,083 --> 00:23:57,583
[KLAUS]
My apologies, Sonic.

397
00:23:57,666 --> 00:23:59,791
I'm afraid I never learned
to speak monkey.

398
00:23:59,875 --> 00:24:00,958
Can you translate, Zapp?

399
00:24:01,041 --> 00:24:02,208
[SONIC gibbers]

400
00:24:02,291 --> 00:24:03,666
[ZAPP]
Yeah, he says he wants a banana

401
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:05,208
for not flingin' his shit.

402
00:24:05,291 --> 00:24:07,791
[LEO] Guess I know why Chain
calls you "monkey brain" now.
