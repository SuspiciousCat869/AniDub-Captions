1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,875
[GILBERT] Two containers of
nemesis coffee beans.

2
00:00:11,958 --> 00:00:15,416
Three kilos of Xestaro
pasta 1.8, in six packs.

3
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,500
Three bundles of eyeball onions.

4
00:00:18,583 --> 00:00:20,375
One bale of ogrehorn carrots.

5
00:00:20,458 --> 00:00:23,125
Eighteen servings of
condensed liver.

6
00:00:25,375 --> 00:00:26,875
[GILBERT]
Well, that's everything.

7
00:00:26,958 --> 00:00:28,666
A pleasure doing
business with you.

8
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:29,541
Thank you, sir.

9
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:32,000
How should I stack these?

10
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:33,958
Anything that needs
to go up top?

11
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:38,000
Oh. Please, allow me
to handle-- Uh!

12
00:00:38,083 --> 00:00:39,333
...that.

13
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:47,416
[KLAUS] The intersection between
two worlds. Hellsalem's Lot.

14
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,083
Libra, a secret society of super
humans toiling in the shadows

15
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:54,333
to preserve the fractured
balance between worlds.

16
00:00:54,416 --> 00:00:56,916
These are the records
of our covert missions.

17
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:30,708
[ZAPP] Yeah, I'm callin'
bullshit, dude.

18
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:32,458
No way that's a skyfish.

19
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:34,416
Looks like you just got some bug
guts smeared on your lens.

20
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,750
I was there, Zapp!

21
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:37,958
I watched it slam into
Gilbert with my own eyes!

22
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:40,291
I do apologize for
alarming you so.

23
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:42,958
Although, there's no
cause for concern.

24
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:45,166
As you can see, I'm perfectly--

25
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:45,750
[GILBERT groans]

26
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:46,750
[LEO]
Heh?

27
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:47,708
[LEO, ZAPP]
Uh?

28
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:49,166
[GILBERT groaning]

29
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:52,583
[phone ringing]

30
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:53,625
[GILBERT]
Yes?

31
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:55,541
[CATHERINE]
Gilbert Franke Altstein.

32
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:59,125
It has been far too long,
my old friend.

33
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:01,166
[GILBERT]
My, what a lovely surprise.

34
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,958
Hello, Head Maid
Catherine Bates.

35
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:04,583
To what do I owe this rarity?

36
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:07,458
I wish this was a social
call, but it's business.

37
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:10,125
I was informed you sustained
some rather grave injuries.

38
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,208
[GILBERT]
Oh, how odd.

39
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:13,333
Wherever would you
hear such a thing?

40
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:14,500
[chuckles]

41
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:17,125
Pretense will not
deter this discussion.

42
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:19,291
Despite his protective
and reticent nature,

43
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:22,458
Master Klaus cannot
keep secrets from me.

44
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:24,750
[GILBERT] You personally
rang him over this matter?

45
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:26,791
[CATHERINE] As head maid
of the Reinherz Family,

46
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:27,875
that is my devoir.

47
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:28,916
[GILBERT]
Yes, but, madam--

48
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,375
[CATHERINE]
In light of your health,

49
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:32,833
I've dispatched additional
aide to provide you relief.

50
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,625
[GILBERT] Most unnecessary.
An imperious judgment, madam.

51
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:44,791
[PHILIP]
There it is. Hellsalem's Lot.

52
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:50,333
[PHILIP screams]

53
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:52,458
[PHILIP]
I'm ready to serve!

54
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:58,458
I'm from the Reinherz
Family Special Butler Corps!

55
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:01,916
My name is Philip Lenore!
I'm honored to serve you!

56
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,958
[LEO]
Holy crap, this dude is loud.

57
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:06,791
Is he always gonna
yell like that?

58
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:08,208
[GILBERT]
Mr. Lenore has been appointed

59
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:10,416
to provide supplementary,
interim aid.

60
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,125
A thoughtful gesture, but I will
maintain the primary role--

61
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,333
[GILBERT groans]

62
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:16,500
[PHILIP]
Are you all right?

63
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:18,250
[GILBERT]
Perfectly fine. Merely resting.

64
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:21,125
Please, Mister Altstein!
You need to convalesce.

65
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:24,000
Allow me to execute the full
purview of your duties.

66
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:27,833
Please, give me the chance to
prove myself as a combat butler.

67
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:30,666
Huh? Did he say combat?

68
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,625
What, like you fight?

69
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:34,041
When necessary, yes.

70
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:35,083
[PHILIP gasps]

71
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:45,083
[KLAUS]
Hey, Gilb--

72
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:46,125
Hm?

73
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,333
[gasps]

74
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:05,833
[STARPHASE]
He drank his tea?

75
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:08,458
And he actually liked it?!

76
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:11,416
You're positive Gilbert
didn't make it for him?

77
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,250
This new guy must
really know his stuff.

78
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:14,916
Count me impressed.

79
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,250
[ZAPP]
Oh, the freaking pain!

80
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:17,500
[LEO]
Calm down, Zapp!

81
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:20,666
My arm! My arm!

82
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:26,375
What the hell?!

83
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:27,875
[CHAIN] I'm sorry! He looked
so weak I couldn't help it!

84
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:29,250
Seriously?

85
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,458
I've called for a doctor.

86
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,333
This should suffice
until they arrive.

87
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:37,625
[LEO]
Ohh...

88
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:38,791
[GILBERT chuckles]

89
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:40,416
[GILBERT]
So he's performing admirably.

90
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,583
Well, that's reassuring to hear.

91
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:45,500
I should've known not to fret
over Head Maid Bates acumen.

92
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:47,875
You can drop the seething
decorum around us.

93
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:49,583
You've got every
reason to freak out.

94
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:52,125
That asshole's clearly
angling to steal your job.

95
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:53,333
[GILBERT chuckles]

96
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:55,416
[GILBERT] I would never
be so paranoid. Ha!

97
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,958
[LEO] I've gotta say, Gilbert's
a pretty remarkable guy.

98
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:01,125
No matter how crazy
things get around here,

99
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:03,916
he always takes
everything in stride.

100
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,833
And he seems to get along
with every person he meets.

101
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:09,416
The thing about him though,

102
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,625
it's almost like he
doesn't have a presence.

103
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:14,083
He's always just standing
there in the background.

104
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:15,625
Sometimes, I don't
even notice him.

105
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,958
He just blends in like
heavily bandaged wallpaper.

106
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:23,875
[LEO] So, um, the Eternal
Hollow's further down that way.

107
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:26,166
Trust me, you don't wanna
go anywhere near there.

108
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,291
If you're gonna use mass
transit, keep an eye out

109
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:30,250
for the destinations
marked with red letters.

110
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:31,666
For those spots
your survival rate

111
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:35,083
goes down by 30%, so avoid 'em.

112
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:37,416
I have to give this
city its proper due.

113
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,791
It far exceeds my imagination.

114
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:41,708
I'm surprised you've managed
to survive this long.

115
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:43,666
Yeah, but, hey,

116
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,458
it's not like every
block of this city

117
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:47,500
is a den of rabid demons.

118
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:51,125
There are still plenty of normal
folks who live here, too.

119
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:52,333
[door opens]

120
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:54,083
Hey, Leo! What's up?

121
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:55,458
[LEO]
How's it goin', Vivian?

122
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:57,500
[VIVIAN]
Not too bad.

123
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,541
[LEO]
Ya see? Just your average diner.

124
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:01,208
Normal as you can get.

125
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:03,291
Uh. Sure.

126
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:06,208
[VIVIAN] Who's this?
Another friend from work?

127
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:08,000
[PHILIP] Yes, I have the
honor of serving as Li--

128
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:11,250
[LEO screams]

129
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:13,166
Yeah? "Li" what?

130
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,958
The live show begins!

131
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:18,041
Who's feeelin' blue?!

132
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:22,833
The blues, yeah!
Bah-da-bah-blues!

133
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:24,416
[VIVIAN]
I guess Leo's finally cracked

134
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,833
under the insanity of
living in this city.

135
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:28,666
Broke his damn brain in two.

136
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:31,500
[LEO] You do know I
can hear you, right?

137
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:34,458
[PHILIP] Hey, uh, did I commit
a faux-pas back there?

138
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:36,541
Saying the name Libra
out loud like that?

139
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:38,208
Libra's got its fair
share of enemies,

140
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,375
and most other people
are just leery of us.

141
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:41,791
We're a secret society.

142
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:44,916
So, y'know, it's safest
to just keep it a secret.

143
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,500
Yeah, that makes sense.

144
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:48,708
[BEYONDER A]
Watch it!

145
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:51,958
[PHILIP]
Pardon me, sir.

146
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:54,458
[BEYONDER A]
Yeah, what d'ya want?

147
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:57,125
[PHILIP] I want you to return
the wallet you just stole.

148
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:59,583
[BEYONDER A] Huh?
'Fraid you're mixed-up, pal.

149
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:01,916
Here, lemme set you straight!

150
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:11,625
[BEYONDER A] Ah! All right!
You win! I'll give it back!

151
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:14,708
[LEO] Thanks for that.
I guess I owe you one.

152
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:17,791
[PHILIP] Think nothing of it.
All a part of the profession.

153
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:19,750
But with this level
of lawlessness,

154
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,583
I worry about your safety here.

155
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:23,666
Not to mention your finances.

156
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,083
[LEO]
Nah. I've got a system for that.

157
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,291
I spread out the cash I've got.

158
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:31,750
The wallet's just a ruse.

159
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:33,250
I only keep small
change in there.

160
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:35,416
[PHILIP] Then you just expect
it to be stolen from you?

161
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,916
Yep.

162
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,291
The smallest bit of trouble
here can spiral into chaos.

163
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:41,291
It's best to shrug it off.

164
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:42,916
[PHILIP]
Hmm...

165
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:47,291
[PHILIP]
Caught you, Mister Altstein.

166
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:48,458
Thought you could
sneak in some work

167
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:49,916
when no one was looking, huh?

168
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,375
[GILBERT chuckles]

169
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:53,583
[PHILIP]
Please return to your bed, sir.

170
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:57,000
So what was that?

171
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:59,291
[GILBERT]
Oh. Amazing, isn't it?

172
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:02,250
It's a sequencer for authoring
my own symphonic compositions.

173
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,875
Oh, come clean.

174
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:06,208
You don't have to keep
everything under wraps.

175
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:09,958
That's the command uplink
system for Libra, isn't it?

176
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:12,916
[GILBERT] This is one duty I
cannot allow you to supersede.

177
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,041
And why not?

178
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:16,083
I'm more than capable
of learning!

179
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:18,125
I don't doubt your aptitude.

180
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:19,666
It is too perilous.

181
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:20,708
Uh! But--

182
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:22,125
If you were to
learn the details

183
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:24,750
of Libra's inner workings,
the contents of your brain

184
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:26,750
would be valued
somewhere in the millions.

185
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,250
You would live in
constant pursuit

186
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:29,625
from all manner of lifeforms.

187
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:31,791
And I would avoid them,
as you have!

188
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:34,041
[GILBERT] This is not
the reality you know.

189
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:35,500
You're simply unprepared.

190
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:38,416
There's little you could
do to stop them.

191
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,333
I'm not strong enough...
Is that it?

192
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:42,625
[GILBERT]
Indubitably.

193
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:43,750
[PHILIP]
Hm.

194
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,375
There's a major flaw
in your reasoning.

195
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:48,416
Explain you.

196
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,541
How have you lasted this long?!

197
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:53,500
And how can you allow Leo
to freely travel on his own?

198
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:54,750
If you think so lowly of me,

199
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:56,416
then why don't you just
tell me to leave?!

200
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,666
[gasps]

201
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:01,625
[PHILIP]
Please forgive me.

202
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:03,500
[GILBERT]
There's nothing to forgive.

203
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:07,791
Such unflinching candor
can prove to be a virtue.

204
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:10,916
However, standing your ground
and embracing confrontation

205
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,958
isn't the only
means of survival.

206
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:16,833
You've had the chance to spend
some time with Leonardo.

207
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,541
So I'm certain that
you've already witnessed

208
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,375
that truth for yourself.

209
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,791
[PHILIP]
Dammit.

210
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:26,083
Whoa, man, careful
with the glassware.

211
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:28,500
[PHILIP]
Oh, um, terribly sorry.

212
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:30,000
[BARTENDER A]
You're one gloomy Gus, huh?

213
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:31,625
[BARTENDER A giggles]

214
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:33,458
Well, whatever's on your mind,

215
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:35,500
you can unload it
on me if you need to.

216
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:37,000
[BARTENDER A giggles]

217
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:42,291
[PHILIP]
For as long as I can remember,

218
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:45,083
I've idolized Gilbert
Franke Altstein,

219
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:47,750
the legendary combat butler.

220
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:50,833
By the time I was employed to
serve the Reinherz family,

221
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,083
he had already left the estate

222
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:54,708
to accompany their
third-oldest son, Klaus,

223
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:58,541
with his esoteric endeavors
in Hellsalem's Lot.

224
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,666
"There are those in
need of protection,

225
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,916
and if I am one of the
few capable of performing

226
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,500
such a deed, I will then
be the first to volunteer."

227
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:10,583
Those words of his, they
exemplify the man's nobility.

228
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:16,083
I truly believed I was the
one who could assist him,

229
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:18,000
but in reality...

230
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:29,291
[BEYONDER A]
You got 'im!

231
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:30,500
[BEYONDER B]
'Course I did.

232
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:31,916
Hang tight a sec.

233
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,291
Just gonna take a quick,
little peek inside his brain.

234
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:36,083
Won't take no time at
all to whip up a list

235
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:38,541
of his friends and family for
you to hunt down and murder.

236
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:40,333
[BEYONDER A]
Ha-ha! Hell, yeah!

237
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:41,708
[BEYONDER A laughing]

238
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:45,291
[BEYONDER B]
Whoa. Hang on, what the hell?

239
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:47,083
This guy's involved
with freakin' Libra!

240
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:48,583
[BEYONDER A]
He what?

241
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,333
[BEYONDER B] I'm out! No way
I'm messin' with that shit!

242
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:52,458
[BEYONDER A]
Hey, not so fast!

243
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,916
[BEYONDER B]
What're ya thinkin'?

244
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,291
[BEYONDER A]
Oh, I'll tell ya.

245
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:59,791
I'm thinkin' we just won
the goddamn lottery.

246
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:03,083
[laughs]

247
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:09,875
[LEO]
Dammit, Zapp!

248
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:12,083
Give me back my burger,
you prehensile dick!

249
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:13,833
You can have it back
after I've digested it.

250
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:17,291
Damn, these Jack Cheese
Rockets are so good!

251
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:18,916
[PHILIP]
Good morning, gentlemen.

252
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,125
[ZAPP]
Huh?

253
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:21,125
--[LEO] Morning!
--[ZAPP] What's crackin', P?

254
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,583
[LEO]
Stop it! Give it back!

255
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:26,666
[ZED]
Hey, good morning, Philip.

256
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:30,291
[ZED]
Hm?

257
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:42,708
[gasps]

258
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:45,291
[GILBERT]
It's evident something is amiss.

259
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:47,666
If you've been compromised
by means of duress,

260
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:51,250
please signal by touching your
face with your left hand.

261
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:57,791
[gasps]

262
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,500
[GILBERT] It's always a shock
to see a brain extraction.

263
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:04,708
I'm sure you're aware,

264
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:07,666
but you've fallen victim
to a dire procedure.

265
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:10,208
Now, as to the matter
of your brain,

266
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:13,375
do you know where it is?

267
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:16,416
No, goodness me.
That complicates things.

268
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:20,750
Well then, please seat
yourself before the console.

269
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:24,583
[GILBERT]
Try not to fret.

270
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:28,250
Take your time and read
every word on the monitors.

271
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:38,000
[BEYONDER C]
Holy shit!

272
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,333
[BEYONDER D]
Fellas, we just struck payday!

273
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:42,375
Only reason Libra's
got the power they do

274
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:44,583
is 'cause nobody knows
nothin' about 'em.

275
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:46,250
But once we got eyes
on the big picture...

276
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:47,666
[BEYONDER F] ...we can
frame it and sell it

277
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:48,708
or burn it to smithereens!

278
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:50,166
This brain was a smart buy!

279
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,958
[BEYONDERS laughing]

280
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,583
[BEYONDERS]
Huh?

281
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:57,250
[GILBERT] Interference is a
common issue with brain control.

282
00:13:57,333 --> 00:13:59,208
They'll fall for it.

283
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:01,000
Now then, Master Leonardo.

284
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:02,791
Would you kindly
track down his brain

285
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:05,416
with your All-seeing
Eyes of the Gods?

286
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,541
Uh, sure.

287
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:19,791
[KLAUS] Got a lock.
I'll reclaim the brain.

288
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:22,833
[GILBERT] I would ask of you
to remain behind, young sir.

289
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:25,750
Mentally accouter your feet
with his symbolic shoes.

290
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:28,833
To bear the dark onus
of burdening his master,

291
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:31,833
not to mention exposing
him to grave danger.

292
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:33,791
That is a shameful regret

293
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:37,166
that will follow him
for the rest of his life.

294
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,958
Not to worry, though.

295
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:42,250
I will swiftly and safely
recover his brain.

296
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:43,333
I assure you.

297
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:45,625
That is an absolute certainty.

298
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:47,250
[LEO]
Hey, there's not enough room!

299
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:48,791
So damn stoic, Gilbert.

300
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:50,375
He's right.

301
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:53,083
Nothin' wrong with askin' your
ass-kickin' friends for help.

302
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:54,916
'Cause that's what we do.

303
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,458
[GILBERT laughs]

304
00:14:56,541 --> 00:15:00,041
[GILBERT] You'll have
to excuse me, gentlemen.

305
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:01,666
I was planning to call upon you

306
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:04,666
once I had properly
warmed up the car.

307
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:11,083
[BEYONDER D]
It's still down!

308
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:12,708
[BEYONDER C] What do we do?
They're probably on to us.

309
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:13,916
[BEYONDER E]
Want me to waste the brain?

310
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,291
[BEYONDER F]
You dumbass!

311
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:17,541
We still got a data treasure
trove stored in there!

312
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,458
[BEYONDER BOSS A]
Everyone calm down.

313
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:22,375
Brain extraction remote
signals are untraceable.

314
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:24,708
They ain't ever gonna find us.

315
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:25,916
[BEYONDER C]
You sure, boss?

316
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,958
[PHILIP]
So this is how I die.

317
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:32,083
A disembodied brain in a bottle
shot by frantic monsters.

318
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:35,041
Not exactly the most
dignified death.

319
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:38,583
[BEYONDER D]
Huh? Hey!

320
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,125
[BEYONDER C]
Who the hell's the kid?

321
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:44,875
[BEYONDER D]
Hey, you! Get out of our face!

322
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:46,291
[BEYONDERS gasp]

323
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:48,916
[GILBERT] Greetings, my fine,
enterprising thugs.

324
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,500
As things stand, you currently
have three options open to you.

325
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:55,083
The first, release the brain
from your possession

326
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:57,375
and abscond into the night.

327
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:59,375
The second, you can
attempt to fight us

328
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,625
and still lose possession
of the brain.

329
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:04,125
This option will lead to
a surfeit of casualties

330
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:05,333
on your end.

331
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:07,750
And the third, you
can foolishly panic

332
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,166
and destroy the brain.

333
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:12,041
This option will result in
the comprehensive massacre

334
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:13,625
of your crew.

335
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:15,375
There will be no exceptions.

336
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:18,791
We will find every last one
of you, and eviscerate you.

337
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:20,291
So which will it be?

338
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:23,791
As a reasonable man, I would
recommend option number one.

339
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:27,458
[BEYONDERS laughing]

340
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:30,291
I can practically taste the
smoke you're blowin' up my ass.

341
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:33,083
Sounds like you got some a'that
sundown dementia, gramps.

342
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:34,666
[ALL laugh]

343
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,708
[GILBERT]
So option one is off the table?

344
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:38,750
You reprobate fools.

345
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:40,000
Just remember....

346
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:42,541
...I tried to warn you.

347
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:45,958
Don't bother begging
for your lives.

348
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:47,583
For the crime you've committed,

349
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:50,583
I will see that you atone
in a baptismal geyser

350
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:53,416
of your own entrials and blood.

351
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,583
I assure you this
is not a threat.

352
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:58,458
It is an absolute certainty.

353
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:01,708
[LEO] Hey! Over there!
They're in that factory!

354
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:08,333
Can't breathe!

355
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:21,083
[BEYONDER D]
Huh?

356
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,583
It's up there! Second floor!

357
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:31,583
Sorry, man!

358
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:33,500
[GILBERT]
No, think nothing of it.

359
00:18:57,916 --> 00:18:59,375
[BEYONDER BOSS A]
Holy crap!

360
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:09,000
[LEO, SONIC scream]

361
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:38,625
[ALL yelping]

362
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:44,958
[GILBERT]
This will be somewhat bumpy.

363
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:47,666
Please buckle up and hold tight.

364
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:48,958
[ALL]
Huh?

365
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:13,166
I'm takin' you to hell with me!

366
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:22,333
[LEO]
Gilbert, no!

367
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:26,250
[BEYONDER BOSS A]
Heh. And that's how it's done.

368
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:29,250
[GILBERT] Don't gloat,
you bush-league imbecile.

369
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:32,500
It takes more than a sword
through my head to kill me.

370
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:34,583
The most damage you've
inflicted upon me

371
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:38,000
is the pain of having to
purchase new bandages.

372
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:41,083
[GILBERT]
You'll have time to regret

373
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:44,416
challenging a Regeneratore...

374
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,166
...when you're
putrefying in hell!

375
00:20:58,166 --> 00:21:00,083
[LEO sighs]

376
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:02,250
You hang in there,
Philip. Almost done.

377
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:04,125
[SONIC gibbers]

378
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:07,250
[ZAPP]
Ugh, man, I am starving.

379
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:11,875
[gasps]

380
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:14,833
[PHILIP]
If you had simply told us

381
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:16,875
you possessed
regenerative abilities,

382
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:18,000
then none of this
would've happened

383
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:20,458
in the first place,
Mr. Altstein.

384
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:22,041
[GILBERT]
I'm sorry for my furtiveness.

385
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:25,333
Although, this ability only
activates within my body

386
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:27,541
in the event of a fatal injury.

387
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:30,333
When it comes to any other
trauma or affliction,

388
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:32,875
I'm just a normal,
frail old man.

389
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,375
[PHILIP]
Uh-huh.

390
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:37,250
I must say,
despite my decrepitude,

391
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:39,333
I am quite fond of this body.

392
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:40,833
[PHILIP]
Oh?

393
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:43,541
[GILBERT] How else could I
remain by Master Klaus' side?

394
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:46,291
Attending to his needs
for many years to come.

395
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:48,750
[GILBERT chuckles]

396
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:49,791
[PHILIP sighs]

397
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:51,208
[GILBERT]
Hm?

398
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:54,500
I'm speechless. It's been
an eye-opening experience.

399
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:56,333
Literally.

400
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:58,791
I've got a lot to learn.
I can see that now.

401
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:00,250
[GILBERT]
Listen, Philip.

402
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:01,458
Sir?

403
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:02,875
Cheer up, lad.

404
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:06,625
At least you have a face
that's fit for this city now.

405
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:07,791
[chuckles]

406
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:08,750
Yeah.

407
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:10,166
[GILBERT]
So what do you say?

408
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:12,750
Would you care to formally
take a permanent position

409
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:14,208
with us at Libra?

410
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,000
[PHILIP gasps]

411
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:20,333
[PHILIP] Oh, no! No, no,
no, no, no! No, sir!

412
00:23:45,833 --> 00:23:48,541
[LEO] Kinda have to wonder why
Klaus even needs a butler.

413
00:23:48,625 --> 00:23:51,500
I mean, just look how happy
he is doing the dishes.

414
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:56,666
[STARPHASE] Although the
All-seeing Eyes of the Gods

415
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:59,541
provide him with absolute
power in matters of sight,

416
00:23:59,625 --> 00:24:02,333
there's something tormenting
him he can't see.

417
00:24:02,416 --> 00:24:04,250
Not that it's anything
to worry about.

418
00:24:04,333 --> 00:24:05,708
I'm sure he'll find
someone out there

419
00:24:05,791 --> 00:24:07,500
who can show him what it is.
