And heads up, they
are not picky eaters.

[STARPHASE]
Y'know.

I think I'm gonna have
to categorize this

169
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:40,250
as one of the more surreal jobs

No.

319
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:10,208
[ACKERMAN]
Then what brought you here?

320
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:21,666
[ACKERMAN]
Sensitive subject?

321
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:24,083
Never mind me.
What's it like outside?

322
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:25,541
[ACKERMAN]
Outside?

323
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:29,291
Oh... Still nothing but
fear and raw nerves.

324
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:30,708
But what else is there to expect

325
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:33,000
when the world's greatest
city is cracked open

326
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:35,750
by a void teeming
with alien life?

327
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:37,958
The general public
are living each day

328
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:40,083
like it's their last on earth.

329
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:42,000
It's an absolute joke.

330
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:45,333
Zero faith in the greatest
nation in history.

331
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:47,875
[LEO] You gonna set 'em straight
with stern uplifting speeches?

332
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:49,083
[ACKERMAN chuckles]

333
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:51,083
[ACKERMAN]
Not that easy.

334
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:52,541
[LEO]
I can see it!

335
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,916
[LEO chuckles]

336
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,833
We're almost there!

337
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:58,541
Eh?!

338
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:00,708
Get down, Leo!

339
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:08,291
[HUMMER]
Ya jerks better not kill Leo!

340
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:10,958
You'll feel real bad
about it later in life!

341
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:12,083
Huh?

342
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:15,041
Deldro? You see where
Leo ran off to?

343
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:16,208
[BRODY]
Nope.

344
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:21,375
[LEO screaming]

345
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:28,791
Heh?

346
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:31,583
[screams]

347
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:35,958
[LEO]
It's hopeless!

348
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:38,958
We're stuck in some kind
of nightmare loop!

349
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:42,375
[ACKERMAN] Leonardo, get back
on your feet and start running!

350
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:44,250
[LEO]
I can't anymore!

351
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:45,916
[ACKERMAN]
Don't cry, run!

352
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,208
You're welcome to
whine all you want,

353
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:49,000
but only after you've lost.

354
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:50,166
[LEO]
Are you for real?

355
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,166
How can you not wanna
give up right now?

356
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,958
You're just a head!

357
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,208
[ACKERMAN] Not giving up,
even if you want to,

358
00:19:57,291 --> 00:20:00,500
is a politician's job.

359
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:03,958
To willingly surrender, when
there's still a glimmer of hope,

360
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:06,458
is selfish and senseless!

361
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:08,250
Look around you and think.

362
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:10,666
Is there nothing
left you can do?

363
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:16,625
[ACKERMAN] Focus on the
most important outcome

364
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:18,458
and fight for it!

365
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,666
[LEO yelling]

366
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:28,958
[LEO] Just a few more blocks
between us and Federal Hall!

367
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,791
I'm chargin' right
through this shit!

368
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:37,833
[ACKERMAN]
Hold on! Let's be cautious!

369
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:39,625
There's no time for that!

370
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,250
[SOLDIERS grunting]

371
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:51,666
Impressively done,
Master Leonardo.

372
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:56,541
[LEO]
Uh.

373
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:58,375
[DURER'S SUBORDINATE A]
Nice of you to join us.

374
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:01,333
So glad to see you're safe
and sound, Leonardo.

375
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:03,833
Bring the head to me
if you want this to end.

376
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:05,958
[ACKERMAN]
Hm? That voice.

377
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:09,583
Wait. Rachel? How could
you act this foolish?

378
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:10,791
You believe you can broker

379
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:13,166
a peaceful coexistence
with these monsters,

380
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:14,791
and you're calling me foolish?

381
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:15,958
[ACKERMAN]
How dare you.

382
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:17,500
[DURER'S SUBORDINATE A chuckles]

383
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:19,541
[DURER'S SUBORDINATE A] Man,
I get a kick out of you humans.

384
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:22,958
You like to call us monsters,
but come on, look at you.

385
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:25,916
I at least get along
with my own kind.

386
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,791
[LEO]
Hey, uh...

387
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:28,041
[DURER'S SUBORDINATE A]
Hm?

388
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:29,916
Could you please explain
to me what you're doing?

389
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,750
[DURER'S SUBORDINATE A]
Uhh...

390
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:33,000
No. I'm not talking to you.

391
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:35,416
The question was
for Klaus and Steven.

392
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,416
It's not what it
looks like, Leonardo.

393
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,333
We were just being
mindful, that's all.

394
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:41,791
Trying to minimize the
inevitable burst of chaos.

395
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:45,000
[DURER'S SUBORDINATE A] Oh, you
were being mindful? Ha, ha.

396
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:46,458
Only thing you're
minimizing here

397
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:49,666
is the severity
of your situation.

398
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,416
Y'know what, Miss Washington?

399
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,833
Sorry about this,

400
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:55,416
but I've just decided to remove
every one of your heads.

401
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,666
[ALL gasp]

402
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:59,041

403

[whimpers]

404
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:07,708
I'll give you some
credit for ambition,

405
00:22:07,791 --> 00:22:09,541
but did you really think
we wouldn't prepare

406
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:11,000
for a double cross?

407
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:12,333
[yells]

408
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:20,291
Well, it's been fun,

409
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:23,500
but I'm afraid there's no
more time to play charades.

410
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:27,958
[ACKERMAN] Our great nation
is beside itself.

411
00:22:28,041 --> 00:22:30,166
How thrilling it is
to have a new world

412
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:32,041
born within our borders.

413
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:35,500
Although the boundless
possibilities within this city--

414
00:22:37,166 --> 00:22:38,958
[LEO]
Oh. Hang on.

415
00:22:39,041 --> 00:22:40,500
Ackerman said they
were gonna pay for me

416
00:22:40,583 --> 00:22:42,583
to get a new apartment.

417
00:22:42,666 --> 00:22:44,458
[STARPHASE]
You can't be serious, Leo.

418
00:22:44,541 --> 00:22:45,833
You're a member of Libra

419
00:22:45,916 --> 00:22:47,666
and you want the government
to know where you live?

420
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:49,041
Are you suicidal?

421
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:50,541
[LEO]
Huh?

422
00:22:50,625 --> 00:22:52,833
We managed to carry out our
mission without any losses.

423
00:22:52,916 --> 00:22:54,625
That's the only
compensation we need.

424
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:56,375
[LEO]
Uh, no, I did lose my home.

425
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:58,625
You could always stay
at the office again.

426
00:22:58,708 --> 00:23:01,166
I've already placed the order
for your new cellphone.

427
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:03,000
You'll rebuild the
rest in due time.

428
00:23:03,083 --> 00:23:04,750

But what about my...?

X--! X--!

431
00:23:08,291 --> 00:23:09,875
I saw this movie the other day.

432
00:23:09,958 --> 00:23:11,833
The heroes went and got
shawarma at the end.

433
00:23:11,916 --> 00:23:13,833
We should totally go
and do that, Deldro.

434
00:23:13,916 --> 00:23:15,625
Sure, why not?

435
00:23:17,125 --> 00:23:20,875
[KLAUS] The intersection between
two worlds. Hellsalem's Lot.

436
00:23:20,958 --> 00:23:24,750
Libra, a secret society of super
humans toiling in the shadows

437
00:23:24,833 --> 00:23:27,833
to preserve the fractured
balance between worlds.

438
00:23:27,916 --> 00:23:30,625
These are the records
of our covert missions.

439
00:23:45,708 --> 00:23:47,125
[LEO]
This is my story,

440
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:51,791
and the story of the
people in my life.

441
00:23:51,875 --> 00:23:53,958
And how they've given me hope.

442
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:56,000
[STARPHASE] Those first three
years after the Great Collapse,

443
00:23:56,083 --> 00:23:57,625
no one knew what to expect.

444
00:23:57,708 --> 00:23:59,500
These days though,
we consider the unexpected

445
00:23:59,583 --> 00:24:01,458
to be this city's BGM.

446
00:24:01,541 --> 00:24:03,375
But that's just another sign
of people's endurance

447
00:24:03,458 --> 00:24:05,041
and capacity to change.

448
00:24:05,125 --> 00:24:08,041
Except Klaus. You
never change, do you?
