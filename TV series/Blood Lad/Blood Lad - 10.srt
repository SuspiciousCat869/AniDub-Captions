-As chance would have it,
I am her dad.

And she inherited
all of her magic powers from me.

But Knell was born after Neyn
merged with her human half,

so his powers
aren't as strong as Bell's.

But they're both great kids,

-She's Yanagi's daughter,

But Neyn and I have been talking

If there are truly any mistakes
that need "fixing"

in the Demon World...

138
00:07:10,609 --> 00:07:13,176

00:07:18,042 --> 00:07:20,609
-I've done a little research
on her resurrection.

141

The best thing is to bring

then send her home
where she belongs.

143
00:07:24,642 --> 00:07:28,109
I figured that's probably why
you played that trick on Yanagi,

144
00:07:28,142 --> 00:07:29,576
but I guess I was wrong.

145

-You've been talking to Braz.

146
00:07:33,709 --> 00:07:36,476
-Yeah, and he told me you wanted
to bring her back to life

147

just so you could feed
on her human blood.

148
00:07:38,609 --> 00:07:42,109
See, kid, I've got no problem
killing you here and now,

149
00:07:42,142 --> 00:07:44,176
but there's only one demon
in the Demon World

150
00:07:44,209 --> 00:07:46,642
that can return Fuyumi
to the way she was before.

151
00:07:48,276 --> 00:07:50,242
And that's you, Staz.

152
00:07:50,276 --> 00:07:52,409
Braz told me
he'd only resurrect Fuyumi

153
00:07:52,442 --> 00:07:54,242
for you, and nobody else,

154
00:07:54,276 --> 00:07:57,642
so that means if I kill you,
Fuyumi will never come back.

155
00:07:57,676 --> 00:07:59,409
But if I allow you to live,

156
00:07:59,442 --> 00:08:02,442
you'll just feed on Fuyumi's

to find out your true feelings.

that he hasn't come back, so...

Be straight with me. How do
you really feel about Staz?

-Do you like him?

accept a vague answer like that?

-You can accept it or not,
but the fact is I don't know.

-Yeah, I thought I did,
at first, but...

-But I mean,
he's special to you, right?

186

-Well, he is trying to bring me
back to life and everything,

187

that does make him special.

-I've been thinking,

and I decided
to let you and Fuyumi go

if you'll both agree
to a couple conditions.

conditions do you want?

-Eat this.
-Blegh.

Looks like a turd with
the word "curse" written on it.

-It's not a turd! It's
a dumpling made with herbs.

217

Cursing herbs, that is.

218

-At least I got it half right.

219
00:10:20,376 --> 00:10:22,476
-You eat this
and make a sacred pledge to me.

220
00:10:22,509 --> 00:10:24,242
If you break it,
you'll be cursed.

-Talk about a pain in the ass.

222
00:10:25,942 --> 00:10:28,109
Why didn't you
just write "pledge" on it?

223
00:10:28,142 --> 00:10:29,976
-Can't tell you
what the curse is,

224
00:10:30,009 --> 00:10:32,042
but if it gets you,
you'll be 100% dead.

225
00:10:32,076 --> 00:10:35,242
-Way to spoil it.
So, what's this pledge, anyway?

226
00:10:35,276 --> 00:10:37,576
-Oh. Yeah,
it's pretty simple, actually.

227
00:10:37,609 --> 00:10:40,442
You're just gonna promise
to obey Fuyumi two times.

-Huh?
-Do you think you could you fly

to the store

if you could do that!

I'm so hungry!

234

-If she asks for that,
I can't do it.

235
00:10:51,476 --> 00:10:53,509
-Is there any chance
you could let me finish?

236
00:10:53,542 --> 00:10:55,509
Those aren't the requests
I'm talking about.

237
00:10:55,542 --> 00:10:57,276
Just keep your eyes
on the dumpling

238
00:10:57,309 --> 00:10:59,042
and listen to what
I'm about to say.

239
00:10:59,076 --> 00:11:02,076
First, when you leave
Demon World with Fuyumi,

240
00:11:02,109 --> 00:11:04,009
you have to ask her permission.

241
00:11:04,042 --> 00:11:06,376
You can only leave
if she answers, "Yes."

242
00:11:06,409 --> 00:11:08,642
Second, if you want to drink
Fuyumi's blood,

243
00:11:08,676 --> 00:11:10,442
you have to ask her permission.

244
00:11:10,476 --> 00:11:13,442
If she answers, "Yes",
you can go ahead and drink it.

245
00:11:13,476 --> 00:11:15,242
Will you swear
to do both of these?

246
00:11:15,276 --> 00:11:16,642
-Hmm.

247
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,242

to do a simple thing like that?

But you must be
very careful, Staz,

for if you break your pledge,
you will die

and you will meet
a horribly tragic end.

468
00:21:17,238 --> 00:21:18,104
-Huh?

469
00:21:18,138 --> 00:21:19,371
-[ Laughs ] All right!

470
00:21:19,404 --> 00:21:22,404
I'm about to make
your big wish come true!

471
00:21:22,438 --> 00:21:25,371
Not because I'm the one who
wants to bring you back to life!

472
00:21:25,404 --> 00:21:27,404
I'm bringing you back to life
because that's what you want!

473
00:21:27,438 --> 00:21:29,104
That's how this works!

474
00:21:29,138 --> 00:21:31,338
Yes, in this moment,
I went from the road to evil,

475
00:21:31,371 --> 00:21:33,238
where I was overcome
by selfish desires,

476
00:21:33,271 --> 00:21:34,704
to becoming a dark hero

477
00:21:34,738 --> 00:21:36,771
who fights on behalf
of the people!

478
00:21:38,004 --> 00:21:41,171
I guess it's time for me
to ask you the real question.

479
00:21:41,204 --> 00:21:42,804
To make your wish come true,

480
00:21:42,838 --> 00:21:44,438
I've got to get you out of here
as soon as I can.

481
00:21:44,471 --> 00:21:48,038
But what I really need to know
is, are you okay with that?

482
00:21:49,904 --> 00:21:51,871
-Isn't that what you want?

483
00:21:51,904 --> 00:21:54,138
-But I thought that only someone
from Hydra

484
00:21:54,171 --> 00:21:55,404
could open up that door.

485
00:21:55,438 --> 00:21:57,238
-Don't worry about the details,
damn it!

486
00:21:57,271 --> 00:21:59,171
I'll take care of it!
Just go with the flow!

487
00:21:59,204 --> 00:22:00,804
-What's the matter with you,
Staz?

488
00:22:00,838 --> 00:22:02,171
You're starting to sweat.

489
00:22:02,204 --> 00:22:04,371
-I'm great!
I always sweat when I'm happy!

490
00:22:04,404 --> 00:22:06,438
See?
Everything's just fine!

491
00:22:06,471 --> 00:22:09,138
-A-All right, sure.
Whatever you say.

492
00:22:09,171 --> 00:22:10,804
Now, cut it out, please.

493
00:22:10,838 --> 00:22:12,771
I'm gonna start having
nightmares.

494
00:22:12,804 --> 00:22:14,071
-Damn.

495
00:22:14,104 --> 00:22:16,071
Why didn't you say so
from the start?

496
00:22:16,104 --> 00:22:18,304
The dark hero almost died
a horrible death

497
00:22:18,338 --> 00:22:19,271
before he got started.

498
00:22:19,304 --> 00:22:20,804
That was a close one.

499
00:22:20,838 --> 00:22:22,671
-There you go again
with your gibberish.

500
00:22:22,704 --> 00:22:25,104
Honestly, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

501
00:22:25,138 --> 00:22:28,804
-Looks like you kept
your promise after all, kid.

502
00:22:28,838 --> 00:22:31,238
-If you're okay
with the way things turned out,

503
00:22:31,271 --> 00:22:32,704
then I'm fine with that.

504
00:22:32,738 --> 00:22:34,704
-You sure, Neyn?

505
00:22:34,738 --> 00:22:38,904
-But I have no intention
of giving up on her either.

506
00:22:38,938 --> 00:22:40,371
-You're on your own now.

507
00:22:40,404 --> 00:22:41,938
From here on out,

508
00:22:41,971 --> 00:22:44,738
you'll find even more challenges
in your path.

509
00:22:44,771 --> 00:22:48,304
You'll have to prove yourself to
be a true hero to overcome them.

510
00:22:48,338 --> 00:22:50,871
Good luck, kid.
You'll need it.

511
00:22:58,513 --> 00:23:02,513
-[ Singing in Japanese ]

512
00:24:36,595 --> 00:24:38,795
-Father, welcome back.
