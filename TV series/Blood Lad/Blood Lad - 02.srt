460
00:22:01,629 --> 00:22:03,962
-OH, WELL, IT ALL JUST SEEMED
TO HAPPEN SO FAST.

461
00:22:03,995 --> 00:22:06,629
AFTER I TOLD HER YOU DIDN'T
TAKE THE BLACK CURTAIN,

462
00:22:06,662 --> 00:22:07,895
WE KIND OF BECAME FRIENDS.

463
00:22:07,929 --> 00:22:09,695
-THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
A SECRET!

464
00:22:09,729 --> 00:22:11,495
YOU NEED TO BE PUNISHED!

465
00:22:11,529 --> 00:22:14,329
-AND THEN WHEN I TOLD HER
YOU WERE LOOKING FOR A WAY

466
00:22:14,362 --> 00:22:17,362
TO BRING ME BACK TO LIFE,
BELL SAID THAT SHE KNOWS A BOOK

467
00:22:17,395 --> 00:22:18,829
THAT SHOWS YOU HOW.
-HUH?

468
00:22:18,862 --> 00:22:23,062
-I SURE DO. AWHILE BACK,
I RAN INTO A LITTLE BOOK

469
00:22:23,095 --> 00:22:26,629
CALLED
THE BOOK OF HUMAN RESURRECTION.

470
00:22:26,662 --> 00:22:28,829
-REALLY?
WHERE IS IT NOW?

471
00:22:28,862 --> 00:22:31,329
-I HAD TO SELL IT.
-WELL, WHAT DID IT SAY?

472
00:22:31,362 --> 00:22:32,895
-LIKE I CARE.
-YOU LITTLE --

473
00:22:32,929 --> 00:22:35,362
-BUT I CAN STILL TELL YOU
WHERE I SOLD IT.

474
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:36,429
-AND WHERE'S THAT?

475
00:22:36,462 --> 00:22:37,929
-HMM...

476
00:22:37,962 --> 00:22:41,529
I BELIEVE IT WAS
OVER IN WEST DEMON WORLD.

477
00:22:41,562 --> 00:22:43,595
WOLF'S TERRITORY, I THINK.

478
00:22:45,971 --> 00:22:49,971
-[ SINGING IN JAPANESE ]

479
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:18,037
-WOLF? NO WAY.

480
00:24:18,071 --> 00:24:20,237
-YOU KNOW HIM, THEN?

481
00:24:20,271 --> 00:24:21,771
-[ WHIMPERS ]

482
00:24:21,804 --> 00:24:22,837
OH, YEAH.

483
00:24:22,871 --> 00:24:25,237
MORE THAN JUST "KNOW HIM."

484
00:24:25,271 --> 00:24:27,404
HE'S WOLF-BOY THE WEREWOLF,

485
00:24:27,437 --> 00:24:30,637
TERRITORY BOSS
OF WEST DEMON WORLD.

486
00:24:30,671 --> 00:24:33,304
HE HAPPENS TO BE
AN OLD FRIEND OF MINE...

487
00:24:33,337 --> 00:24:34,804
AND MY RIVAL.

488
00:24:35,871 --> 00:24:38,371
-WHAT'S THE BOSS
OF WEST DEMON WORLD LIKE?

489
00:24:38,404 --> 00:24:40,771
-I DON'T KNOW, BUT I'M GUESSING
HE'S A COMPLETE NIMROD,

490
00:24:40,804 --> 00:24:41,737
JUST LIKE STAZ.

491
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:43,237
MOST DEMONS ARE.

492
00:24:43,271 --> 00:24:45,671
-NEXT TIME ON "BLOOD LAD,"
"YOU HAD IT ALL ALONG."

493
00:24:45,704 --> 00:24:48,371
-IN THE DEMON WORLD,
IT'S GOOD TO BE BAD.
