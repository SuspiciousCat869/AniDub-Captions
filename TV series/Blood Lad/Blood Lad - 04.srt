SO, WHAT'S THIS PLACE FOR?

465
00:24:03,019 --> 00:24:05,919
MUST BE WHERE THE PRISONERS COME
TO HAVE A NICE PICNIC.

466
00:24:05,952 --> 00:24:07,186
-NO, IT'S NOT!

467
00:24:07,219 --> 00:24:09,819
I'LL LET YOU IN
ON A LITTLE SECRET.

468
00:24:09,852 --> 00:24:14,186
THE TRUTH IS, YOU CAN LEAVE
THIS PRISON ANY TIME YOU WANT.

469
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:17,386
JUST PUSH THE LITTLE RED BUTTON
AND DEFEAT THESE GUYS.

470
00:24:17,419 --> 00:24:19,086
THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT.

471
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:21,386
-[ GROWLING ]

472
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:24,786
-BUT SO FAR, NO ONE HAS.

473
00:24:24,819 --> 00:24:27,152
SPEND SOME TIME WITH THEM,
AND YOU'LL LEARN

474
00:24:27,186 --> 00:24:29,719
YOU'RE JUST LIKE THE REST
OF THE SCUM HERE.

475
00:24:29,752 --> 00:24:31,219
-HA HA!

476
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:37,386
-DR. FRANKEN, YOU REALLY CREATED
AN ARTIFICIAL DEMON?

477
00:24:37,419 --> 00:24:40,786
-YES. I SPECIALIZE
IN BODY MODIFICATION.

478
00:24:40,819 --> 00:24:42,986
CARE FOR A LITTLE
COSMETIC SURGERY?

479
00:24:43,019 --> 00:24:45,786
-NEXT TIME ON "BLOOD LAD,"
"UNIDENTIFIED DEMON OBJECT."

480
00:24:45,819 --> 00:24:48,386
-IN THE DEMON WORLD,
IT'S GOOD TO BE BAD.
