00:08:06,243 --> 00:08:09,009
What do you say we check in
on Wolf and cheer him on...

164
00:08:09,043 --> 00:08:10,609
from a box seat?

165
00:08:10,643 --> 00:08:11,643
-Huh?

166
00:08:14,276 --> 00:08:16,143
Oh! Wolf!

167
00:08:19,709 --> 00:08:21,543
What the hell is that thing?

168
00:08:24,576 --> 00:08:27,776
-So, what do you think
of my little magic trick?

169
00:08:27,809 --> 00:08:29,043
-Damn it.

170
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:33,643
It's wearing off
faster than I thought.

171
00:08:33,676 --> 00:08:34,943
-Staz is back!

172
00:08:34,976 --> 00:08:36,976
-Hold on!
What's he doing here?!

173
00:08:37,009 --> 00:08:38,276
-You out of time, Wolf?

174
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:40,009
This must be the first guy

175
00:08:40,043 --> 00:08:42,676
who's survived
your werewolf form, huh?

176
00:08:42,709 --> 00:08:44,876
-Hey, I'm not done with him yet.

177
00:08:44,909 --> 00:08:46,043
-Yeah, right.

178
00:08:46,076 --> 00:08:48,076
So, you gonna introduce me
or what?

179
00:08:48,109 --> 00:08:51,609
This punk rocker
is the so-called monster, right?

180
00:08:51,643 --> 00:08:54,043
-It sounds like
you know about me, too, huh?

181
00:08:54,076 --> 00:08:55,676
How's that?

182
00:08:55,709 --> 00:08:57,909
-What about getting answers
from your brother?

183
00:08:57,943 --> 00:08:59,976
-What about watching Fuyumi?

-That's not my problem!
-Excuse me.

-If you don't have time,
hurry up and say it!

-I said I don't have time
to tell you!

190
00:09:08,909 --> 00:09:11,043
-What do you mean, you
don't have time to tell
me you don't have time?!

191
00:09:11,076 --> 00:09:13,076

[ All gasp ]

You're 10 years too early.

206
00:09:50,309 --> 00:09:53,076
-It's not like any vampire magic
I've ever seen.

207
00:09:53,109 --> 00:09:55,076
-No, it wasn't.
Could he have...?

208
00:09:55,109 --> 00:09:56,243
-I knew it.

209
00:09:56,276 --> 00:09:58,209
Listen up, bullet-less.
-Huh?

210
00:09:58,243 --> 00:10:02,076
-I need to step out and recharge
my magic, which means...

211
00:10:02,109 --> 00:10:04,976
-It means if you tried
to fight him now,

212
00:10:05,009 --> 00:10:08,109
he could easily tear you
into little pieces.

00:10:08,143 --> 00:10:09,676
-Yeah, that's right.

214

So I'm out of this.

215

But I'll bet
you could do some real damage.

216
00:10:13,209 --> 00:10:16,676
Now, why don't we try
saving our argument for later

217
00:10:16,709 --> 00:10:19,576
and start focusing
on what we came here to do?

218

You know what I'm saying?

-It's my turn.

00:10:23,543 --> 00:10:25,043
-Exactly.

221
00:10:26,176 --> 00:10:29,809
Don't get yourself killed
until I recover, vampire.

222
00:10:29,843 --> 00:10:31,743
-What was that all about?

-[ Thinking ] <i>I think I know.</i>

-Yeah.

227
00:10:44,109 --> 00:10:47,009
Wolf Man had to scamper back
and fetch his favorite stick.

228
00:10:47,043 --> 00:10:48,943
And I knocked you
all the way out here

229
00:10:48,976 --> 00:10:50,609
so I could kick your ass.

230

You ready?
-I see.

231
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:56,009
This sure is a lonely place
you blasted me to.

00:10:56,043 --> 00:10:58,743
-Doesn't seem to bother you
too much.

233
00:10:58,776 --> 00:11:00,876
At least <i>pretend</i> to be scared.

234
00:11:00,909 --> 00:11:02,709
-I've got a little quiz for you.

235
00:11:02,743 --> 00:11:05,076
Why do you think
I waited for you out here

236
00:11:05,109 --> 00:11:08,176
after you so rudely
blasted me to this place?

237
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:09,843
-Beats me.

238
00:11:09,876 --> 00:11:11,976
Maybe you saw an ants' nest
and got distracted.

239
00:11:12,009 --> 00:11:13,476
You're not real bright.

00:11:13,509 --> 00:11:15,209
-[ Chuckles ] Funny.

241
00:11:15,243 --> 00:11:18,009
The correct answer is,
I thought this open space

242
00:11:18,043 --> 00:11:20,876
would be the perfect spot
to fight the two of you

243

with everything I've got.

244

-Man, you suck
at giving quizzes.

245

-Oh, I was looking forward
to this!

246
00:11:27,543 --> 00:11:29,009
Why'd you have to come alone?!

247
00:11:29,043 --> 00:11:30,543
-Isn't that obvious?!

248
00:11:32,143 --> 00:11:35,176
'Cause I'm more than a match
for you.

249
00:11:35,209 --> 00:11:38,009
-That attack
and your last one, too --

250
00:11:38,043 --> 00:11:39,609

You know, for once,
you're right, Bell.

258
00:11:55,976 --> 00:11:58,009
Staz has definitely
gotten stronger.

-Not quite.

I can tell these smaller attacks

00:12:08,009 --> 00:12:09,676
-A single attack.

266
00:12:09,709 --> 00:12:11,243
I'm gonna unleash an attack

267
00:12:11,276 --> 00:12:14,009
that's so big,
it'll blow you away.

-It's sickening to watch
such waste of talent.

You're comprised
of excellent parts,

yet you have no idea
how to put them to good use.

Your moves are powerful,

but they leave you vulnerable
and lack beauty.

283

The last one was god-awful.

284
00:12:53,589 --> 00:12:56,756
You attempted to unleash
that attack with such swagger --

285
00:12:56,789 --> 00:12:58,656

00:13:05,322 --> 00:13:09,156
-That move comes from the single
greatest hero in the universe.

290
00:13:09,189 --> 00:13:12,489
If he was standing here
and had attacked you with it,

291
00:13:12,522 --> 00:13:16,189
your sorry ass
would be turned into dust.

292
00:13:16,222 --> 00:13:19,856
You understand what I'm saying?
That's how awesome it is.

293
00:13:19,889 --> 00:13:22,289
You're alive
'cause I'm just a poseur.

294
00:13:22,322 --> 00:13:25,156
I was imitating
the greatest move

295
00:13:25,189 --> 00:13:27,389
of the greatest fighter ever!

296
00:13:27,422 --> 00:13:29,122
Of course I'm third-rate.

297
00:13:29,156 --> 00:13:31,689
I'm not worthy
to use such a technique.

298
00:13:31,722 --> 00:13:35,389
Which is why I have to fight
with my own style.

299
00:13:35,422 --> 00:13:37,456
-About time.
Why don't you --

300
00:13:37,489 --> 00:13:39,089
-Just shut up!

301
00:13:39,122 --> 00:13:41,122
I've decided...

302
00:13:41,156 --> 00:13:45,322
I'm gonna kill you
with a new finishing move --

303
00:13:45,356 --> 00:13:48,289
my original
super-finishing move!

304
00:13:48,322 --> 00:13:50,289
So I suggest you get ready.

305
00:13:50,322 --> 00:13:52,322
You're about to be destroyed
with an attack

306

created by the same guy
you called third-rate!

-[ Chuckles ] I see.

308
00:13:57,756 --> 00:14:00,389
Sounds like you've finally
gotten serious about this.

I think you've definitely
become something

310

He is what Staz was missing
all along --

315
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:19,656
an extremely powerful opponent,
worthy of his true potential.

[ Chuckles ]

317
00:14:21,256 --> 00:14:25,456
Now, Liz, pay close attention
to what happens.

318
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:28,422
Things are about to get
very interesting.

319

No -- your <i>brother's</i> magic

00:14:36,356 --> 00:14:38,122
-Let's go.

322
00:14:38,156 --> 00:14:40,256
-[ Snaps fingers ]
-Aah!

323
00:14:40,289 --> 00:14:42,389
Hey! What'd you
close the space for?!

324
00:14:42,422 --> 00:14:45,322
-Must be nice to be a low-level
demon with no worries.

325
00:14:45,356 --> 00:14:48,156
If we keep on watching,
we'll get blown away, too.

326
00:14:48,189 --> 00:14:51,556
Well, I got a few things to do,
so...later, guys.

327
00:14:51,589 --> 00:14:53,456
-Hey! Aww.

328
00:14:53,489 --> 00:14:56,356
She always does this to us,
you know?

329
00:14:56,389 --> 00:14:58,356
I wonder
how the fight turned out.

330
00:14:58,389 --> 00:15:00,556
-So beautiful.

331
00:15:00,589 --> 00:15:02,356
I have the feeling

332
00:15:02,389 --> 00:15:06,456
that I'm finally seeing you
exactly as you were meant to be.

333
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:10,422
In the blink of an eye,
we met...

334
00:15:10,456 --> 00:15:12,356
then parted.

335
00:15:15,322 --> 00:15:17,789
And this is the outcome.

336
00:15:17,822 --> 00:15:19,722
Truly a beautiful end.

337
00:15:19,756 --> 00:15:21,489
-Get up.

338
00:15:21,522 --> 00:15:25,456
-Unfortunately, I've used up
all my magic fighting you.

339
00:15:25,489 --> 00:15:27,456
I have no desire to continue.

340
00:15:27,489 --> 00:15:28,689
-That's too bad.

341
00:15:28,722 --> 00:15:30,422
See, I don't remember saying

342
00:15:30,456 --> 00:15:32,689
that we could stop this
on <i>your</i> terms,

343
00:15:32,722 --> 00:15:36,456
because this fight
has just begun.

344
00:15:42,822 --> 00:15:44,522
-Can I ask you a question?

345
00:15:44,556 --> 00:15:47,389
For me, raw power
is the essence of beauty.

346
00:15:47,422 --> 00:15:49,156
What is it to <i>you?</i>

347
00:15:49,189 --> 00:15:50,356
-A burden.

-I see.

349
00:15:52,356 --> 00:15:54,322
-I've been thinking
about which move

350
00:15:54,356 --> 00:15:56,156
I should finish you off with.

351
00:15:56,189 --> 00:15:59,289
But it's becoming a real pain
to decide which one is best,

352
00:15:59,322 --> 00:16:01,622
so...I'll use my favorite.

you sick, patchwork freak.

355

-[ Strained ] Not bad.

356
00:16:09,189 --> 00:16:12,722
It's quite a fitting move

-[ Grunts ]

358

Glad you approve.

-You done here?

360
00:16:27,256 --> 00:16:29,389
I know
you just finished fighting,

361
00:16:29,422 --> 00:16:31,322
but I have a favor to ask.

362
00:16:31,356 --> 00:16:33,189
-Huh?

363
00:16:34,356 --> 00:16:36,322
-There's no doubt in my mind.

364
00:16:36,356 --> 00:16:38,322
He's the perfect one
for the job.

365
00:16:38,356 --> 00:16:41,222
-But I don't think
he'd be willing to help you.

366
00:16:41,256 --> 00:16:43,356
-That doesn't matter.

367
00:16:43,389 --> 00:16:46,156
Let's go, Liz.
There's work to be done.

368
00:16:46,189 --> 00:16:48,256
-Oh! Two left!

369
00:16:48,289 --> 00:16:50,389
Aah!
And time's running out!

370
00:16:50,422 --> 00:16:52,222
What the hell's taking
those guys so long, anyway?!

00:16:52,256 --> 00:16:53,422
-It's gonna be all right.

372

-Hey! Come on!
Get serious!

373
00:16:55,756 --> 00:16:57,756
What the hell?

374
00:16:58,822 --> 00:17:00,589
-It'll be okay.

375
00:17:00,622 --> 00:17:03,322
I'm sure the three of them
are doing everything they can.

376
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:07,289
-I made a promise
to resurrect Fuyumi.

377
00:17:07,322 --> 00:17:09,389
So if what you're saying
is true,

378
00:17:09,422 --> 00:17:11,189
then I'm not gonna hold back.

379

-It's the truth, all right.

380

She'll be disappearing
in a few hours --

all because of you.

00:17:16,322 --> 00:17:19,122
-Then why do you insist
on wasting our time

383
00:17:19,156 --> 00:17:21,389
by challenging me again
for Fuyumi?

384
00:17:21,422 --> 00:17:23,389
-You know me well enough by now.

385
00:17:23,422 --> 00:17:26,489
I can't rest
until we've settled things.

-Yeah?

387
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:30,722
Guess our motives aren't
always logical, are they?

388
00:17:30,756 --> 00:17:32,289
Let's do this.

-I'm a pro at spatial magic.
This was child's play.

Poor guy. He probably thought
he managed to get away.

Your technique --
It's the same as mine.

-You're wrong.
<i>My</i> skill is the original.

399
00:18:00,589 --> 00:18:02,556
Yours is just a cheap imitation.

400
00:18:02,589 --> 00:18:05,322
Akim couldn't remember

401
00:18:05,356 --> 00:18:07,656
where he learned
to use his magical skill.

402
00:18:07,689 --> 00:18:11,456
Until he met me, he thought
it was something all his own.

403

So quit beating around the bush,
Franken.

404

Tell me who the demon was
that you used to make Akim.

All right.

Back then, my research
seemed to be at a dead end.

408

No matter how I tried,
it was no good.

409
00:18:27,389 --> 00:18:29,356
I couldn't obtain the one part

410
00:18:29,389 --> 00:18:32,456
that would be the key
to holding him together.

Have you been a good boy?

00:18:40,356 --> 00:18:41,622
I have a present for you.

-All right, who is this?

-Why don't you step outside
and have a little peek?

418
00:18:45,589 --> 00:18:49,256
I'm sure it'll jog your memory.

419
00:18:49,289 --> 00:18:52,622
-In that box was the body
of a spatial-magic user,

420
00:18:52,656 --> 00:18:55,589
which became the core
for Akim's current body.

421
00:18:55,622 --> 00:18:57,289
-So that's it, huh?

422
00:18:57,322 --> 00:19:00,256
<i>He's</i> the thief
who stole my spatial magic?

423
00:19:00,289 --> 00:19:01,589
-Most likely.

424
00:19:01,622 --> 00:19:04,422
-So, who was
this "Santa Claus," anyway?

425
00:19:04,456 --> 00:19:06,389
-No clue.
He's never revealed himself.

426

-Oh, great.

427
00:19:08,222 --> 00:19:11,322
So, just when I think I've
finally found the magic thief,

428
00:19:11,356 --> 00:19:13,156
there's another mystery to be --

-What have we here?

-Don't be alarmed.
I haven't reported it to anyone.

Actually, I'm here

-Frankenstein and Akim Papradon,

It doesn't make any sense.

Of course you don't.

like that, haven't you?

-Hey! Calm down, Wolf!

480
00:21:15,722 --> 00:21:17,356
-He's just
a spoiled little brat!

481
00:21:17,389 --> 00:21:19,622
-He's not!
He came from above!

482
00:21:19,656 --> 00:21:22,656
I know what that means!
You're one of the noble demons!

483
00:21:22,689 --> 00:21:24,189
Aren't you, you punk?!

484
00:21:24,222 --> 00:21:27,622
Why won't you fight me
like you mean it?!

485
00:21:27,656 --> 00:21:31,556
-Because if I did that,
then I would kill you.

486
00:21:31,589 --> 00:21:34,322
-"Who cares
if he's a noble demon?"

487
00:21:34,356 --> 00:21:36,522
That's what I used to think
back then.

488
00:21:36,556 --> 00:21:38,322
I thought I was so tough

489
00:21:38,356 --> 00:21:40,756
and that being a mongrel
wouldn't really matter much.

490
00:21:40,789 --> 00:21:42,422
But you know what, Staz?

491
00:21:42,456 --> 00:21:45,589
Turns out I was so weak,
you had to take pity on me.

492
00:21:45,622 --> 00:21:48,189
Even with your true power
sealed away,

493
00:21:48,222 --> 00:21:51,289
I wasn't even worthy
of you fighting at your best.

494
00:21:51,322 --> 00:21:54,389
How can I ever be satisfied
knowing all of that?

495
00:21:56,722 --> 00:21:57,722
See ya.

496
00:21:57,756 --> 00:22:00,589
But it's not over between us.

497
00:22:00,622 --> 00:22:03,522
Next time,
I'll make you fight for real.

498
00:22:03,556 --> 00:22:06,222
-I won't -- not against <i>you.</i>

499
00:22:06,256 --> 00:22:08,056
'Cause you're my friend.

500
00:22:09,256 --> 00:22:10,456
-Ah. How touching.

501
00:22:10,489 --> 00:22:12,022
-Braz?!

502
00:22:12,056 --> 00:22:14,556
-It seems that you have acquired
a true friend.

503
00:22:14,589 --> 00:22:16,522
-W-What are you doing out here?!

504
00:22:16,556 --> 00:22:19,156
And how'd you appear
out of nowhere?!

505
00:22:19,189 --> 00:22:20,522
-Liz had work to do,

506
00:22:20,556 --> 00:22:23,322
so we asked <i>her</i>
to bring us down here.

507
00:22:23,356 --> 00:22:25,589
-They say, "If you can't
beat 'em, join 'em."

508
00:22:25,622 --> 00:22:26,756
So I did.

509
00:22:26,789 --> 00:22:28,989
Sorry. [ Giggles ]

510
00:22:29,022 --> 00:22:30,356
-I must say --

511
00:22:30,389 --> 00:22:33,122
this young lady and that
young man from earlier --

512
00:22:33,156 --> 00:22:34,989
You have
remarkably good friends.

513
00:22:35,022 --> 00:22:36,189
Wouldn't you agree, Liz?

514
00:22:36,222 --> 00:22:37,389
-They must like jerks.

515
00:22:37,422 --> 00:22:39,222
-What's the matter
with you guys?

516
00:22:39,256 --> 00:22:41,456
If you're finished,
then just hurry up and leave.

517
00:22:41,489 --> 00:22:43,256
-Oh, but I have some business.

518
00:22:43,289 --> 00:22:46,456
Have you forgotten
the deal we made?

519
00:22:46,489 --> 00:22:48,456
About resurrecting a human?

520
00:22:48,489 --> 00:22:49,656
-[ Scoffs ]

521
00:22:49,689 --> 00:22:51,722
-First, let's go
and meet this young girl

522
00:22:51,756 --> 00:22:54,322
you want to bring back,
shall we?

523
00:22:54,356 --> 00:22:56,256
-[ Gasps ]

524
00:22:59,321 --> 00:23:03,321
-[ Singing in Japanese ]

525
00:24:32,621 --> 00:24:35,154
-Which way is west?

526
00:24:35,188 --> 00:24:37,454
-Liz is spending
the night with us?!

527
00:24:37,488 --> 00:24:39,454
That sounds like so much fun!
Let's play cards together!

528
00:24:39,488 --> 00:24:42,554
-Why are you getting so excited?
-Huh? But --

529
00:24:42,588 --> 00:24:44,754
-I'm not exactly thrilled.
I want to go home.

530
00:24:44,788 --> 00:24:47,354
-Next time on "Blood Lad" --
"Liz, For the First Time."

531
00:24:47,388 --> 00:24:50,421
-In the demon world,
it's good to be bad.
