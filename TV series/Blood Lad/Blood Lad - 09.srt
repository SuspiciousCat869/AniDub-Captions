but are you a virgin?

Okay, then.

-Are you feeling all right,
Fuyumi?

474
00:21:51,914 --> 00:21:55,548
-Uh, yeah.
Your family's been really nice.

-Not that! I mean the stuff
about you, me, and Mom.

How do you feel about it?

00:21:59,581 --> 00:22:02,014
-To be honest...

478
00:22:02,048 --> 00:22:04,548
it's so sudden,
I don't know what to think.

479
00:22:04,581 --> 00:22:07,314
It's kind of been that way ever
since I came to the Demon World,

480
00:22:07,348 --> 00:22:08,514
but...

481

-Hey, all I'm trying
to tell you is...

488
00:22:24,348 --> 00:22:26,114
just relax and think positive

489
00:22:26,148 --> 00:22:28,481
and don't try
to take it so seriously.
