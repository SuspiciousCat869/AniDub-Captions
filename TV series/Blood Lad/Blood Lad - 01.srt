-HMM?

451
00:21:33,062 --> 00:21:36,462
-IT'S JUST, HE SEEMS SO
IRRESPONSIBLE.

452
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:39,295
-WILL HE REALLY TRY
TO BRING ME BACK TO LIFE,

453
00:21:39,328 --> 00:21:41,528
OR WAS THAT
JUST AN EMPTY PROMISE?

454
00:21:41,562 --> 00:21:45,528
-MM, WELL, ONCE HE FINALLY MAKES
UP HIS MIND TO DO SOMETHING,

455
00:21:45,562 --> 00:21:47,528
HE SEES IT THROUGH TO THE END.

456
00:21:47,562 --> 00:21:49,395
HE'LL GO TO THE HUMAN WORLD

457
00:21:49,428 --> 00:21:52,795
EVEN IF IT MEANS GIVING UP
HIS POSITION AS THE BOSS.

458
00:21:52,828 --> 00:21:55,562
ONCE THAT SWITCH IS ON,
HE CAN'T TURN IT OFF,

459
00:21:55,595 --> 00:21:58,428
AND 'CAUSE OF THAT,
HE'S ALWAYS DRIVIN' US CRAZY

WITH ONE THING AFTER ANOTHER.

461
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:02,395
THAT MUST BE TOUGH.

462
00:22:02,428 --> 00:22:05,695
-THERE'S ONE THING I CAN TELL
YOU, THOUGH --

463
00:22:05,728 --> 00:22:08,895
REMEMBER WHEN HE WAS TALKING
ABOUT BRINGING YOU BACK TO LIFE?

464
00:22:08,928 --> 00:22:13,362
I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM
LOOK SO DETERMINED.

465
00:22:13,395 --> 00:22:15,362
-R-REALLY?

466
00:22:15,395 --> 00:22:19,195
S-SOUNDS LIKE
A PRETTY STRANGE GUY TO ME.

467
00:22:19,228 --> 00:22:23,662
-HUH? HEY, WHO SAID YOU COULD
SIT THERE AND EAT MY TSUCHINOKO?

468
00:22:26,295 --> 00:22:28,362
-TSUCHINOKO!

469
00:22:28,395 --> 00:22:32,228
-I WAS SAVING IT FOR LAST!
HEY, SATY, GRILL ME ANOTHER ONE.

470
00:22:32,262 --> 00:22:34,662
-NO, DON'T!
-WHY NOT?

471
00:22:34,695 --> 00:22:37,662
-SO, THE PARTY CONTINUED WITH
PEOPLE I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW,

472
00:22:37,695 --> 00:22:39,795
DOING THINGS
I DIDN'T ALWAYS UNDERSTAND.

473
00:22:39,828 --> 00:22:41,395
-TSUCHINOKO!

474
00:22:41,428 --> 00:22:44,362
-THE TSCUCHINOKO
WAS ACTUALLY VERY GOOD, THOUGH,

475
00:22:44,395 --> 00:22:45,795
AND THE FOLLOWING DAY,

476
00:22:45,828 --> 00:22:48,828
MY SCHOOL UNIFORM WAS COMPLETELY
DRY AND READY TO GO.

477
00:22:54,218 --> 00:22:58,218
-[ SINGING IN JAPANESE ]

478
00:24:26,718 --> 00:24:28,018
-ALL RIGHT, THEN.

479
00:24:28,051 --> 00:24:29,718
OFF TO THE HUMAN WORLD!

480
00:24:29,751 --> 00:24:31,984
-HMM.

481
00:24:34,018 --> 00:24:35,684
ALL RIGHT!
THE HUMAN WORLD!

482
00:24:35,718 --> 00:24:37,818
-YOU'D BETTER FIND
A WAY TO REVIVE ME.

483
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:40,984
-YEAH, SURE -- AFTER I GET
MY PRECIOUS DVDs AND FIGURES!

484
00:24:41,018 --> 00:24:42,784
-THAT'S YOUR PRIORITY?

485
00:24:42,818 --> 00:24:45,651
N-NEXT TIME ON "BLOOD LAD,"
"BACK HOME, BUT NOT REALLY."

486
00:24:45,684 --> 00:24:48,518
-IN THE DEMON WORLD,
IT'S GOOD TO BE BAD.
