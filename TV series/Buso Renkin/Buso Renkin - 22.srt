NARRATOR: The supernatural
alloy produced

2
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:18,933
by gathering the essence
of alchemy is the Kakugane.

3
00:00:18,966 --> 00:00:22,866
This device activates upon a
person's fighting instinct,

4
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,466
manifesting the
possessor's inner power

5
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,100
into a tangible form, creating
a weapon like no other.

6
00:00:30,133 --> 00:00:32,166
Its name, Buso Renkin.

00:02:11,241 --> 00:02:12,707
-He's coming!

9
00:02:12,741 --> 00:02:13,707
Papa!

10
00:02:13,741 --> 00:02:14,807
Welcome home!

11
00:02:19,407 --> 00:02:22,541
-Welcome home, dear.

12
00:02:22,574 --> 00:02:23,174
-I'm back.

13
00:02:27,607 --> 00:02:32,607
To fight against fear,
and to avoid disaster,

14
00:02:32,641 --> 00:02:36,474
so that more people
can live in happiness.

15
00:02:36,507 --> 00:02:39,441
That is what this
power exists for.

16
00:02:42,374 --> 00:02:42,841
Victoria.

17
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:46,007
Alexandria.

BUSTER BARON: Buso Renkin
of the Missile Launcher,

19
00:03:11,707 --> 00:03:12,541
Extermination Circus!

20
00:03:29,674 --> 00:03:32,007
-Extermination Circus,
all shots on target.

21
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:33,241
-Did we get him?

22
00:03:33,274 --> 00:03:33,941
-No.

23
00:03:33,974 --> 00:03:35,207
It wasn't even close.

24
00:03:35,241 --> 00:03:37,507
If he was that easy
to kill, we wouldn't

25
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:38,974
have to go through
all this trouble.

26

MAN: What?

27
00:03:46,407 --> 00:03:47,174
-Impossible.

28
00:03:47,207 --> 00:03:49,141
There's not even a scratch!

29
00:03:49,174 --> 00:03:51,774
-Keep your distance as you
continue your offensive attack.

30
00:03:51,807 --> 00:03:55,507
We will drive Victor
ito point A205.

31
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:56,374
MAN: Aye-aye.

32
00:03:56,407 --> 00:03:58,074
-I'm counting on all of you.

33
00:04:08,174 --> 00:04:09,707
-Such futile efforts.

34
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:16,007
It appears that
quite a few of you

35
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:19,141
gathered while I
was taking a nap.

36
00:04:19,174 --> 00:04:19,641
Hm.

37
00:04:24,607 --> 00:04:25,907
I see.

38
00:04:25,941 --> 00:04:28,841
So that's their plan.

39
00:04:28,874 --> 00:04:30,607
Very well, then.

40
00:04:30,641 --> 00:04:32,141
I'll just play along for now.

41
00:04:40,874 --> 00:04:42,207
-Victor's approaching!

42
00:04:42,241 --> 00:04:43,274
All right, men.

43
00:04:43,307 --> 00:04:44,474
Are you all ready?

44
00:04:44,507 --> 00:04:45,507
-Of course we are.

45
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:47,241
-There's no need to ask.

46
00:04:47,274 --> 00:04:49,674
-Ready to follow your lead, sir.

47
00:04:49,707 --> 00:04:53,641
-The world will be saved
if we just defeat Victor.

48
00:04:53,674 --> 00:04:54,541
-This is great.

49
00:04:54,574 --> 00:04:55,774
It's so simple.

50
00:04:55,807 --> 00:04:57,607
There's nothing
absurd about this.

51
00:04:57,641 --> 00:04:59,907
If we can somehow manage
to defeat this guy,

52
00:04:59,941 --> 00:05:02,707
then we will be the full-fledged
saviors of the entire world.

53
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:09,441
-Inukai, Maruyama.

54
00:05:09,474 --> 00:05:11,907
I'm sure you two know by now.

55
00:05:11,941 --> 00:05:13,141
-No need to tell us twice.

56
00:05:13,174 --> 00:05:15,074
We learned our lesson.

57
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:17,074
-We have already
fought him once.

58
00:05:17,107 --> 00:05:19,507
We are well aware he's not
the kind of opponent one

59
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:20,941
can handle alone.

60
00:05:20,974 --> 00:05:22,274
NEGORO: Very well, then.

61
00:05:22,307 --> 00:05:25,541
-We will combine our
powers and destroy him.

62
00:05:28,607 --> 00:05:29,107
-Buso Renkin!

63
00:05:37,307 --> 00:05:40,541
-All Alchemist Warriors
must be destroyed.

64
00:05:40,574 --> 00:05:44,241
Are you all prepared to die?

65
00:05:44,274 --> 00:05:45,441
-All write, dirtbag!

66
00:05:45,474 --> 00:05:46,141
Let's go!

67
00:05:54,174 --> 00:05:55,274
GOTA: Here we are.

68
00:05:55,307 --> 00:05:57,474
Newton Apple Academy for Girls

69
00:05:57,507 --> 00:05:59,874
KAZUKI: The person who knows
about the black Kakugane is

70
00:05:59,907 --> 00:06:02,041
somewhere in here.

71
00:06:02,074 --> 00:06:04,607
-Let's go.

72
00:06:04,641 --> 00:06:06,641
PAPILLON: What took you so long?

73
00:06:06,674 --> 00:06:07,507
-Huh?

74
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:09,674
-I was getting tired of waiting.

75
00:06:09,707 --> 00:06:10,541
KAZUKI: Chouno?

76
00:06:10,574 --> 00:06:11,941
what are you doing here?

77
00:06:11,974 --> 00:06:13,141
-Well, let's see.

78
00:06:13,174 --> 00:06:16,007
I heard you guys were
being chased all over,

79
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:18,807
so I decided to come check
things out with this little one

80
00:06:18,841 --> 00:06:19,307
here.

81
00:06:19,341 --> 00:06:20,607
-Kazuki!

82
00:06:20,641 --> 00:06:22,007
I missed you, Kazuki!

83
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:23,941
You had it so rough
all this time!

84
00:06:27,807 --> 00:06:29,141
-Who the heck are these two?

85
00:06:29,174 --> 00:06:31,141
-We don't have time to
be chit-chatting with you

86
00:06:31,174 --> 00:06:31,741
right now.

87
00:06:36,241 --> 00:06:39,974
If you get in our way--

88
00:06:40,007 --> 00:06:41,607
-Hold it, Tokiko.

89
00:06:41,641 --> 00:06:43,441
Angel Gozen is with him.

90
00:06:43,474 --> 00:06:45,807
That mean Chouno didn't
come to interfere.

91
00:06:45,841 --> 00:06:48,207
-Uh-huh.

92
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,674
That's right, Tokiko!

93
00:06:49,707 --> 00:06:52,107
Papillon's definitely come
here to help you guys!

94
00:06:52,141 --> 00:06:55,974
He even took out some Alchemist
Warriors along the way!

95
00:06:56,007 --> 00:06:58,907
OUKA: Kazuki, Tokiko, we
got a general understanding

96
00:06:58,941 --> 00:07:02,141
of the situation by hacking into
the Alchemist Army's computer.

97
00:07:02,174 --> 00:07:04,374
We need to move quickly.

98
00:07:04,407 --> 00:07:05,607
-Oh, I get it.

99
00:07:05,641 --> 00:07:07,841
So that's what's going on.

100
00:07:07,874 --> 00:07:09,841
-Hm.

101
00:07:09,874 --> 00:07:12,341
-I'm glad to see
you're safe, Muto.

102
00:07:12,374 --> 00:07:13,474
-Yeah.

103
00:07:13,507 --> 00:07:15,741
Same goes for you.

104
00:07:15,774 --> 00:07:16,674
-Tokiko, look.

105
00:07:16,707 --> 00:07:17,174
Over there!

106
00:07:22,407 --> 00:07:24,174
-Who's that over there?

107
00:07:24,207 --> 00:07:27,707
-That's the same person I saw
in the underground chamber.

108
00:07:27,741 --> 00:07:29,641
-He sure seems to be
in a rush, doesn't he?

109
00:07:36,607 --> 00:07:37,541
[sigh]

110
00:07:46,974 --> 00:07:49,341
-Aw, Dammit What's
with this guy?

111
00:07:49,374 --> 00:07:52,241
He just keeps on
running and running.

112
00:07:52,274 --> 00:07:53,974
-Stop complaining, will you?

113
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:55,441
That's exactly what
we're here for.

114
00:07:55,474 --> 00:07:57,041
Let's find out what's going on.

115
00:08:06,074 --> 00:08:08,074
He's headed for a dead end.

116
00:08:08,107 --> 00:08:09,074
This game is over.

117
00:08:16,974 --> 00:08:18,907
A school girl?

118
00:08:18,941 --> 00:08:20,141
-Hey there.

119
00:08:20,174 --> 00:08:21,974
Have you seen anyone
suspicious come through here?

120
00:08:22,007 --> 00:08:23,107
-Are you kidding?

121
00:08:23,141 --> 00:08:25,307
She's pretty suspicious herself.

122
00:08:25,341 --> 00:08:26,507
PAPILLON: You're right.

123
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:28,407
I can tell by the smell.

124
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:30,507
She's a Homunculus.

125
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:31,107
-A Homunculus?

126
00:08:34,441 --> 00:08:38,907
-I'll show you the
way, Kazuki Muto.

127
00:08:38,941 --> 00:08:43,341
Or maybe I should call
you Victor Three now.

128
00:08:43,374 --> 00:08:44,474
Come with me.

129
00:08:44,507 --> 00:08:47,374
Momma is waiting inside.

130
00:08:47,407 --> 00:08:48,307
This is the entrance.

131
00:08:52,607 --> 00:08:56,374
We are going to tell
you about your fate.

132
00:08:56,407 --> 00:08:58,874
-Buso Renkin of
the Military Dog.

133
00:08:58,907 --> 00:08:59,874
Killer Rabies!

134
00:09:06,874 --> 00:09:08,507
-Secret Trail!

135
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:10,041
-Futile.

136
00:09:10,074 --> 00:09:12,007
-It divided itself.

137
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:13,874
-A double axe?

138
00:09:13,907 --> 00:09:15,241
-I got him!

139
00:09:15,274 --> 00:09:17,574
Reverse Do!

140
00:09:17,607 --> 00:09:18,841
-I said it was futile!

141
00:09:21,841 --> 00:09:23,274
-Killer Rabies!

142
00:09:23,307 --> 00:09:25,774
-Bubble Cage!

143
00:09:25,807 --> 00:09:26,274
-Enough!

144
00:09:39,741 --> 00:09:42,274
-It looks like he's using
the gravity control again.

145
00:09:42,307 --> 00:09:44,141
-We're not able to get close.

146
00:09:44,174 --> 00:09:47,174
-You guys take the
wounded and fall back.

147
00:09:47,207 --> 00:09:48,307
-Busujima.

148
00:09:48,341 --> 00:09:49,807
Time to shine.

149
00:09:49,841 --> 00:09:50,807
-Yes, sir!

150
00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:55,207
Aerial Operator!

151
00:09:55,241 --> 00:09:56,674
-Hm.

152
00:09:56,707 --> 00:09:59,474
It's not poison gas.

153
00:09:59,507 --> 00:10:00,141
This is--

154
00:10:00,174 --> 00:10:01,874
HIWATARI: It's oxygen!

155
00:10:01,907 --> 00:10:03,007
-What is that?

156
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:05,674
-When my flames combine
with Busujima's oxygen,

157
00:10:05,707 --> 00:10:10,441
the destructive force becomes
10 to 20 times larger.

158
00:10:10,474 --> 00:10:11,441
Too bad.

159
00:10:11,474 --> 00:10:14,641
Unlike you, we're not alone.

160
00:10:14,674 --> 00:10:17,307
Burn to ashes, Victor!

161
00:10:17,341 --> 00:10:18,207
-Oxygen!

162
00:10:18,241 --> 00:10:19,307
-Blaze of Glory!

163
00:10:23,441 --> 00:10:24,907
[scream]

164
00:10:34,741 --> 00:10:38,641
[scream]

165
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:47,007
-What?

166
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:49,174
Is he charred?

167
00:10:49,207 --> 00:10:50,607
No!

168
00:10:50,641 --> 00:10:52,541
His skin color has changed!

169
00:10:57,874 --> 00:10:59,307
Ah!

170
00:10:59,341 --> 00:11:01,041
-No!

171
00:11:01,074 --> 00:11:04,307
-Victor is progressing
to his third stage.

172
00:11:04,341 --> 00:11:05,974
-Then he's progressing
to the next stage

173
00:11:06,007 --> 00:11:07,474
like Victor Three just did.

174
00:11:07,507 --> 00:11:12,807
Only he's more advanced and is
now changing into stage three.

175
00:11:12,841 --> 00:11:13,907
-Retreat.

176
00:11:13,941 --> 00:11:17,307
All vessels leave
this area at once.

177
00:11:17,341 --> 00:11:20,974
Send rescue to Hiwatari
and the others immediately.

178
00:11:21,007 --> 00:11:23,374
-Yes, sir!

179
00:11:23,407 --> 00:11:27,707
-It seems I must now take
this matter into my own hands.

180
00:11:27,741 --> 00:11:28,807
-What do you mean, sir?

181
00:11:28,841 --> 00:11:29,607
Great Warrior Chief!

182
00:11:36,574 --> 00:11:39,041
-How many casualties will
there be from here on?

183
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:46,707
TOKIKO (VOICEOVER):
The entrance location

184
00:11:46,741 --> 00:11:49,474
is different than
it was last time.

185
00:11:49,507 --> 00:11:52,141
VICTORIA: We change the
location periodically.

186
00:11:52,174 --> 00:11:54,874
It would be problematic
if we were discovered.

187
00:11:54,907 --> 00:11:58,374
My Buso Renkin, the
Underground Searchlight,

188
00:11:58,407 --> 00:12:00,174
has the ability
to build shelters

189
00:12:00,207 --> 00:12:02,874
in walls, and on the ground.

190
00:12:02,907 --> 00:12:06,674
Once I seal the entrance,
there's no way we can be found.

191
00:12:10,241 --> 00:12:11,507
-Whoa.

192
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:12,907
That's amazing.

193
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:14,974
-She doesn't have
much sense of design

194
00:12:15,007 --> 00:12:16,974
when it comes to
construction, though.

195
00:12:17,007 --> 00:12:19,141
-What a weird Buso Renking.

196
00:12:19,174 --> 00:12:21,341
Can this even be
considered a weapon?

197
00:12:21,374 --> 00:12:23,674
-Look who's talking.

198
00:12:23,707 --> 00:12:25,841
-Here we are This is it.

199
00:12:37,141 --> 00:12:37,641
-Huh?

200
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:38,541
What's this?

201
00:12:38,574 --> 00:12:39,574
Ah!

202
00:12:39,607 --> 00:12:40,374
Brains!

203
00:12:40,407 --> 00:12:42,041
There are brains everywhere!

204
00:12:42,074 --> 00:12:42,674
Ew!

205
00:12:42,707 --> 00:12:44,041
Yuck, yuck, yuck!

206
00:12:44,074 --> 00:12:44,874
-Wait a sec.

207
00:12:44,907 --> 00:12:47,007
This is artificial intelligence.

208
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:48,241
ALEXANDRIA: You are correct.

209
00:12:48,274 --> 00:12:49,341
-Huh?

210
00:12:49,374 --> 00:12:53,241
ALEXANDRIA: I am not
artificial intelligence.

211
00:12:53,274 --> 00:12:55,007
Pleased to meet you.

212
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:58,674
I am the developer of the
black Kakugane, Victor's wife,

213
00:12:58,707 --> 00:13:00,641
Alexandria.

214
00:13:00,674 --> 00:13:06,041
And the child behind you
is our daughter, Victoria.

215
00:13:06,074 --> 00:13:08,807
-Victor's wife and
Victor's daughter?

216
00:13:08,841 --> 00:13:11,174
-So this was the person
behind the mask then, huh?

217
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:12,541
-But why?

218
00:13:12,574 --> 00:13:14,241
Why are you like this?

219
00:13:14,274 --> 00:13:15,941
-If you've got something
to say to Muto,

220
00:13:15,974 --> 00:13:17,374
just hurry up and say it, brain.

221
00:13:17,407 --> 00:13:18,207
-Chouno.

222
00:13:18,241 --> 00:13:20,674
-Show some manners, will you?

223
00:13:20,707 --> 00:13:21,941
ALEXANDRIA: Very well, then.

224
00:13:21,974 --> 00:13:27,941
I will tell you about
everything we have done so far.

225
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:32,341
We've been conducting certain
research here for many years.

226
00:13:32,374 --> 00:13:38,241
Of course, it is not a
research done for your sake.

227
00:13:38,274 --> 00:13:40,407
However, it is the
only research that

228
00:13:40,441 --> 00:13:43,574
can turn you back into a human.

229
00:13:43,607 --> 00:13:48,107
-So that's how it is, then your
objective's to restore Victor

230
00:13:48,141 --> 00:13:49,841
back into a human state, right?

231
00:13:49,874 --> 00:13:51,041
-Restore Victor?

232
00:13:51,074 --> 00:13:52,607
ALEXANDRIA: You are
very perceptive.

233
00:13:52,641 --> 00:13:54,974
That is exactly right.

234
00:13:55,007 --> 00:13:56,307
-Then that means--

235
00:13:56,341 --> 00:13:57,307
-You're so naive.

236
00:14:00,174 --> 00:14:03,141
Do you really think that
the power of alchemy

237
00:14:03,174 --> 00:14:05,407
can bring happiness
to everyone so easily?

238
00:14:13,609 --> 00:14:16,576
Do you really think that
the power of alchemy

239
00:14:16,609 --> 00:14:21,209
can bring happiness
to everyone so easily?

240
00:14:21,243 --> 00:14:22,143
-Hey, you.

241
00:14:22,176 --> 00:14:25,009
What exactly do
you mean by that?

242
00:14:25,043 --> 00:14:27,076
ALEXANDRIA: Now, Victoria.

243
00:14:27,109 --> 00:14:27,776
-Hmph.

244
00:14:27,809 --> 00:14:29,209
There's no need to rush.

245
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:31,543
Once you hear Momma's
story, you'll understand.

246
00:14:31,576 --> 00:14:32,476
ALEXANDRIA: Victoria.

247
00:14:32,509 --> 00:14:34,876
-I've done all you
asked me to do.

248
00:14:34,909 --> 00:14:37,476
Take care of the
rest as you wish.

249
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:40,009
You know that I hate
everything about alchemy,

250
00:14:40,043 --> 00:14:42,376
just like daddy does, don't you?

251
00:14:42,409 --> 00:14:44,509
You know that, momma.

252
00:14:44,543 --> 00:14:48,043
Just being around Alchemist
Warriors makes me sick.

253
00:14:51,443 --> 00:14:55,243
-She sure has a lot of
attitude for someone so small!

254
00:14:55,276 --> 00:14:57,243
-Have you seen yourself
in a mirror lately?

255
00:15:07,276 --> 00:15:09,209
[shout]

256
00:15:14,109 --> 00:15:15,776
-Energy drain.

257
00:15:15,809 --> 00:15:17,343
-It's on a whole
different level.

258
00:15:17,376 --> 00:15:20,609
-Move farther away, or
we'll be killed instantly.

259
00:15:20,643 --> 00:15:21,509
-That's enough.

260
00:15:21,543 --> 00:15:22,209
-Huh?

261
00:15:22,243 --> 00:15:22,976
Wait, that voice.

262
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:30,709
-From here on, I will
be your opponent.

263
00:15:35,043 --> 00:15:36,443
-Huh?

264
00:15:36,476 --> 00:15:38,376
What is that?

265
00:15:38,409 --> 00:15:39,409
-Take a good look.

266
00:15:39,443 --> 00:15:41,009
-Warrior Chief Hiwatari.

267
00:15:41,043 --> 00:15:44,276
-That is the Great Warrior Chief
Shusei Sakaguchi's Buso Renkin.

268
00:15:56,209 --> 00:15:58,809
-Buso Renkin of the Full
Plate Armor, Buster Baron.

269
00:16:04,543 --> 00:16:05,009
Huh?

270
00:16:15,876 --> 00:16:18,809
Huh?

271
00:16:18,843 --> 00:16:20,343
ALEXANDRIA: Around
100 years ago,

272
00:16:20,376 --> 00:16:23,643
a large scale had taken
place between the Alchemist

273
00:16:23,676 --> 00:16:26,243
Army and the Homunculi.

274
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:28,776
During that time,
my husband Victor

275
00:16:28,809 --> 00:16:33,043
was the most powerful
Warrior in the army.

276
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:36,243
However, he was fatally
injured in a battle

277
00:16:36,276 --> 00:16:37,843
against the Homunculi.

278
00:16:37,876 --> 00:16:43,009
There was simply no other
way to save his life.

279
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:46,676
We decided to transplant a
philosopher's stone into him.

280
00:16:46,709 --> 00:16:49,309
No, rather, a
black Kakugane that

281
00:16:49,343 --> 00:16:51,109
was still in the
midst of research.

282
00:16:54,009 --> 00:16:55,576
You all know what
happened as a result.

283
00:17:03,309 --> 00:17:06,643
As my consciousness
was fading, all I saw

284
00:17:06,676 --> 00:17:09,076
was the destruction, the
bodies of my comrades,

285
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:12,809
and the tear-streaked
face of the being that

286
00:17:12,843 --> 00:17:14,009
was once my husband.

287
00:17:14,043 --> 00:17:17,309
[scream]

288
00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:23,509
ALEXANDRIA: my body ceased to
function from the neck down,

289
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:27,209
and I did not regain
consciousness for seven years.

290
00:17:27,243 --> 00:17:31,443
What I saw when I woke
up was my daughter,

291
00:17:31,476 --> 00:17:35,376
alone and no longer a
human, caring for me.

292
00:17:35,409 --> 00:17:37,843
KAZUKI: Why did your daughter
turn into a Homunculus?

293
00:17:37,876 --> 00:17:40,076
ALEXANDRIA: I do
not know the reason.

294
00:17:40,109 --> 00:17:43,676
She would never tell me.

295
00:17:43,709 --> 00:17:45,576
-There is no point
in listening to what

296
00:17:45,609 --> 00:17:48,843
happened to you 100
years ago, brain.

297
00:17:48,876 --> 00:17:51,876
Just hurry up and
tell us the results

298
00:17:51,909 --> 00:17:54,609
of your so-called research
for restoring Victor back

299
00:17:54,643 --> 00:17:56,576
to being human.

300
00:17:56,609 --> 00:17:57,243
ALEXANDRIA: Yes.

301
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:58,576
Of course.

302
00:17:58,609 --> 00:18:00,643
In the turmoil that followed,
we stole the two remaining

303
00:18:00,676 --> 00:18:03,743
black Kakugane, and we
came to this country

304
00:18:03,776 --> 00:18:06,109
where my husband was last seen.

305
00:18:06,143 --> 00:18:09,209
Here I began my research.

306
00:18:09,243 --> 00:18:13,109
I discarded my useless
body, and cloned my brain

307
00:18:13,143 --> 00:18:16,876
repeatedly to create a network
to magnify my intellect.

308
00:18:16,909 --> 00:18:20,676
I used the third black Kakugane
to create a new prototype that

309
00:18:20,709 --> 00:18:23,276
would contain its immense
power, and turn it back

310
00:18:23,309 --> 00:18:25,509
into an ordinary Kakugane.

311
00:18:25,543 --> 00:18:27,943
That's the one
that you recovered,

312
00:18:27,976 --> 00:18:29,909
and the one inside
your chest right now.

313
00:18:34,876 --> 00:18:39,276
I had already tested the
results, so I let her take it.

314
00:18:39,309 --> 00:18:41,743
It seems when you
clashed with Victor,

315
00:18:41,776 --> 00:18:44,676
the two black Kakugane
resonated with each other,

316
00:18:44,709 --> 00:18:46,643
destroying the protective seal.

317
00:18:46,676 --> 00:18:48,543
-It seems my butt, you quack!

318
00:18:48,576 --> 00:18:50,176
Because of that, Kazuki was--

319
00:18:50,209 --> 00:18:51,743
-It's OK, Angel Gozen.

320
00:18:51,776 --> 00:18:53,143
Then what happened?

321
00:18:53,176 --> 00:18:54,976
What happened after that?

322
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:57,943
ALEXANDRIA: We gathered data
from that prototype as a base,

323
00:18:57,976 --> 00:18:59,576
and carried out
further research.

324
00:18:59,609 --> 00:19:02,876
We are now just one step
away from completion.

325
00:19:02,909 --> 00:19:05,843
-What?

326
00:19:05,876 --> 00:19:06,343
What the--

327
00:19:15,176 --> 00:19:18,376
-What is this?

328
00:19:18,409 --> 00:19:19,876
ALEXANDRIA: The white Kakugane.

329
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:24,276
It will nullify all the
power of the black Kakugane.

330
00:19:24,309 --> 00:19:27,376
-Then if we use this, our
problem with Victor and--

331
00:19:27,409 --> 00:19:31,976
-All of Kazuki's problems
will be solved, as well!

332
00:19:32,009 --> 00:19:33,509
-Tokiko, what's wrong?

333
00:19:33,543 --> 00:19:36,676
-Thank goodness.

334
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:38,643
-Oh, Tokiko.

335
00:19:38,676 --> 00:19:43,609
-I am so-- I am so relieved.

336
00:19:43,643 --> 00:19:45,276
-Tell me something, brain.

337
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:51,109
What exactly did you use
as a basis to develop this?

338
00:19:51,143 --> 00:19:52,809
-Huh?

339
00:19:52,843 --> 00:19:54,976
ALEXANDRIA: You are
truly perceptive,

340
00:19:55,009 --> 00:19:56,443
to the point of being cold.

341
00:19:56,476 --> 00:19:57,409
Almost cruel.

342
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:13,543
-It seems his physical
strength is slightly more

343
00:20:13,576 --> 00:20:14,943
powerful than my Buster Baron.

344
00:20:33,576 --> 00:20:34,509
Buster Knuckle!

345
00:20:37,976 --> 00:20:38,943
-All right!

346
00:20:38,976 --> 00:20:39,976
-Did that do it?

347
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:48,209
-Below?

348
00:20:59,509 --> 00:21:00,209
-He's unharmed?

349
00:21:00,243 --> 00:21:01,443
How can that be?

350
00:21:01,476 --> 00:21:03,609
-I have a feeling this is
going to be a long battle.

351
00:21:07,909 --> 00:21:09,376
ALEXANDRIA: As you
probably guessed,

352
00:21:09,409 --> 00:21:12,876
we used the black Kakugane,
similar to the prototype

353
00:21:12,909 --> 00:21:14,209
inside Kazuki.

354
00:21:14,243 --> 00:21:18,076
The very last one of the three.

355
00:21:18,109 --> 00:21:20,909
-How long would it take
to create black Kakugane

356
00:21:20,943 --> 00:21:25,776
from scratch, and then alter
it into a white Kakugane?

357
00:21:25,809 --> 00:21:27,276
ALEXANDRIA: The
process for creating

358
00:21:27,309 --> 00:21:32,076
a black Kakugane was
lost 100 years ago.

359
00:21:32,109 --> 00:21:36,476
Unfortunately, it would be just
about impossible for my aged

360
00:21:36,509 --> 00:21:39,309
brain to duplicate
one from scratch.

361
00:21:39,343 --> 00:21:42,043
-So basically, that means that--

362
00:21:42,076 --> 00:21:43,543
ALEXANDRIA: There
are two Victors,

363
00:21:43,576 --> 00:21:46,509
but there is only
one white Kakugane.

364
00:21:46,543 --> 00:21:49,943
Therefore, between
Victor and Kazuki Muto,

365
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:52,976
only one can go back
to his human form.

366
00:21:56,009 --> 00:21:58,943
I will give you
the white Kakugane

367
00:21:58,976 --> 00:22:00,943
as soon as it is completed.

368
00:22:00,976 --> 00:22:08,343
How it will be used will
be your decision, Kazuki.

369
00:22:08,376 --> 00:22:11,843
-Do you really think
that the power of alchemy

370
00:22:11,876 --> 00:22:14,143
can bring happiness
to everyone so easily?

371
00:22:23,848 --> 00:22:33,882

372
00:23:54,584 --> 00:23:56,717
TOKIKO: You tried to
protect me back then,

373
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:58,684
so this time I'll protect you.

374
00:23:58,717 --> 00:24:03,984
No matter what happens, you
and I are one, body and soul.

375
00:24:04,017 --> 00:24:08,184
Next time, Boy
Meets Battle Girl.
