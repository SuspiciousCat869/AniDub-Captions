NARRATOR: The supernatural
alloy produced

2
00:00:13,651 --> 00:00:18,018
by gathering the essence
of alchemy is the Kakugane.

3
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:21,918
This device activates upon a
person's fighting instinct,

4
00:00:21,951 --> 00:00:24,251
manifesting the
possessor's inner power

5
00:00:24,285 --> 00:00:29,085
into a tangible form, creating
a weapon like no other.

6
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:31,485
Its name, Buso Renkin.

7
00:00:35,385 --> 00:00:38,818
[theme music]

8
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:13,331
-You look pretty
beat up, aren't you?

9
00:02:13,364 --> 00:02:14,631
I'll talk to the warrior chief.

10
00:02:14,664 --> 00:02:17,831
You should rest tonight.

11
00:02:17,864 --> 00:02:18,597
-I'm OK.

12
00:02:18,631 --> 00:02:19,931
I'm just getting started.

13
00:02:19,964 --> 00:02:22,564
-You're not very convincing
talking to me in your sleep.

14
00:02:22,597 --> 00:02:23,531
Just rest.

15
00:02:23,564 --> 00:02:24,764
KAZUKI: We don't
know when someone

16
00:02:24,797 --> 00:02:26,364
might be in danger out there.

17
00:02:26,397 --> 00:02:27,664
Or where.

18
00:02:27,697 --> 00:02:29,064
I don't need to rest.

19
00:02:29,097 --> 00:02:31,231
I should be training more.

20
00:02:31,264 --> 00:02:34,964
I just want to become as strong
as I (SLURRING) possibly can,

21
00:02:34,997 --> 00:02:35,497
you hear?

22
00:02:39,331 --> 00:02:40,464
-Hello, Warrior Chief.

23
00:02:40,497 --> 00:02:42,097
This is Tokiko.

24
00:02:42,131 --> 00:02:45,064
Is it all right if Kazuki took
a break from training today?

25
00:02:45,097 --> 00:02:46,031
BRAVO: Sure.

26
00:02:46,064 --> 00:02:48,464
Besides, it's raining
out there, so I

27
00:02:48,497 --> 00:02:50,964
guess there won't
be training tonight.

28
00:02:50,997 --> 00:02:52,431
-Taking a day off
because of rain.

29
00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:55,231
-The Warrior Chief's
so easy going.

30
00:02:55,264 --> 00:02:57,064
-Tokiko, do you
have an umbrella?

31
00:02:57,097 --> 00:02:57,931
-No.

32
00:02:57,964 --> 00:02:58,831
Do you?

33
00:02:58,864 --> 00:03:00,464
KAZUKI: No.

34
00:03:00,497 --> 00:03:01,697
What should we do?

35
00:03:01,731 --> 00:03:02,664
Should we run?

36
00:03:02,697 --> 00:03:03,331
-Here.

37
00:03:03,364 --> 00:03:04,931
You can borrow this.

38
00:03:14,531 --> 00:03:16,231
You really shouldn't
let a pretty girl get

39
00:03:16,264 --> 00:03:19,064
wet in the rain,
don't you think?

40
00:03:19,097 --> 00:03:21,331
I'll just wait for my little
brother's club activities

41
00:03:21,364 --> 00:03:24,631
to end and go home with him.

42
00:03:24,664 --> 00:03:25,497
TOKIKO: Who's that?

43
00:03:25,531 --> 00:03:26,697
KAZUKI: I think she's--

44
00:03:26,731 --> 00:03:28,931
-Ouka Hayasaka, Class 3A
student council president!

45
00:03:31,731 --> 00:03:32,697
-Kazuki.

46
00:03:32,731 --> 00:03:34,231
I thought you were
devoted to Tokiko,

47
00:03:34,264 --> 00:03:35,697
so I stood back
and secretly wished

48
00:03:35,731 --> 00:03:37,364
for my best friend's happiness.

49
00:03:37,397 --> 00:03:39,664
But now you've
betrayed me again!

50
00:03:39,697 --> 00:03:40,531
-Don't say anything.

51
00:03:40,564 --> 00:03:41,764
You'll only make things worse.

52
00:03:41,797 --> 00:03:44,164
-On top of that, you
toy with her emotions!

53
00:03:44,197 --> 00:03:45,031
-Shut up, pervert.

54
00:03:48,731 --> 00:03:49,497
-What?

55
00:03:49,531 --> 00:03:51,297
All you guys have umbrellas?

56
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:53,864
Then I should probably
give this one back.

57
00:03:53,897 --> 00:03:56,597
Does anyone know what club
the president's brother is in?

58
00:03:56,631 --> 00:03:57,664
ROKUMASU: Are you kidding?

59
00:03:57,697 --> 00:04:00,764
He's quite famous around here.

60
00:04:00,797 --> 00:04:01,697
-Awesome.

61
00:04:01,731 --> 00:04:03,697
-He's the star of
the kendo club.

62
00:04:03,731 --> 00:04:05,664
Last year he topped the
individual nationals.

63
00:04:05,697 --> 00:04:06,597
-Oh, hi there.

64
00:04:09,364 --> 00:04:10,331
-Thank you for this.

65
00:04:10,364 --> 00:04:11,864
I met up with my
friends, and it looks

66
00:04:11,897 --> 00:04:14,431
like we've got the
umbrella situation covered.

67
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:16,097
Your little brother
is really good.

68
00:04:16,131 --> 00:04:19,331
-He sure is, but lately he
feels that he's hit a wall.

69
00:04:23,131 --> 00:04:24,864
-Are you all right?

70
00:04:24,897 --> 00:04:26,497
-Get the first aid kit!

71
00:04:26,531 --> 00:04:28,031
-Sorry about that.

72
00:04:28,064 --> 00:04:28,797
So who's next?

73
00:04:32,997 --> 00:04:34,664
-Isn't that enough, Hayasaka?

74
00:04:34,697 --> 00:04:36,497
I have no doubt that,
with your skill,

75
00:04:36,531 --> 00:04:39,564
you'll surely be able to
win the next tournament.

76
00:04:39,597 --> 00:04:40,564
-No.

77
00:04:40,597 --> 00:04:42,964
Winning is not that
important to me.

78
00:04:42,997 --> 00:04:47,664
Right now, I just want to become
as strong as I possibly can.

79
00:04:47,697 --> 00:04:49,797
-But you know, Hayasaka,
all the other team members

80
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:52,497
will get crushed if you
continue training anymore.

81
00:04:52,531 --> 00:04:54,131
-I'll go easy on them.

82
00:04:54,164 --> 00:04:55,731
KAZUKI: I'll do it.

83
00:04:55,764 --> 00:04:56,564
-Hey!

84
00:04:56,597 --> 00:04:57,531
What do you think you're doing?

85
00:04:57,564 --> 00:04:59,164
You're wiped out and exhausted.

86
00:04:59,197 --> 00:05:00,164
-I'm OK.

87
00:05:00,197 --> 00:05:01,297
I don't have any
training for tonight.

88
00:05:01,331 --> 00:05:03,131
And besides, I kinda
cheered up a little bit

89
00:05:03,164 --> 00:05:04,631
having found someone like me.

90
00:05:04,664 --> 00:05:07,831
Someone who feels
the same as I do.

91
00:05:07,864 --> 00:05:10,131
-Hey, sorry kid, but you're
not even on the team.

92
00:05:10,164 --> 00:05:11,531
-No, it's all right.

93
00:05:11,564 --> 00:05:14,464
It doesn't look like any of the
team members will take me on,

94
00:05:14,497 --> 00:05:15,364
so let's do it.

95
00:05:19,197 --> 00:05:21,397
-Even though Hayasaka is
going pretty easy on him,

96
00:05:21,431 --> 00:05:22,664
he's still pretty good.

97
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:24,564
-He still hasn't
even scored one hit.

98
00:05:24,597 --> 00:05:26,297
TOKIKO (VOICEOVER):
Well, Kazuki's already

99
00:05:26,331 --> 00:05:28,797
survived real battles,
and the Warrior Chief

100
00:05:28,831 --> 00:05:30,697
has been training
him for a whole week.

101
00:05:30,731 --> 00:05:32,631
This shouldn't be
much of a surprise.

102
00:05:36,897 --> 00:05:38,131
-Just as I thought.

103
00:05:38,164 --> 00:05:40,297
You're new to kendo,
but you more than

104
00:05:40,331 --> 00:05:43,997
make up for it with
your speed and agility.

105
00:05:44,031 --> 00:05:45,064
-What?

106
00:05:45,097 --> 00:05:48,864
-Against you, I won't
need to hold back.

107
00:05:48,897 --> 00:05:50,631
Do!

108
00:05:50,664 --> 00:05:51,297
-There it is.

109
00:05:51,331 --> 00:05:52,164
Hyasaka's favrotie!

110
00:05:52,197 --> 00:05:53,231
-Reverse do!

111
00:05:53,264 --> 00:05:54,697
-Reverse do or left do.

112
00:05:54,731 --> 00:05:56,864
Samurai used to wear
both swords on the left,

113
00:05:56,897 --> 00:05:59,364
making it difficult to
land a fatal blow there.

114
00:05:59,397 --> 00:06:01,364
Even in today's
kendo, scoring a point

115
00:06:01,397 --> 00:06:03,531
on the left with a
reverse do is difficult.

116
00:06:03,564 --> 00:06:05,064
-Man, how do you
know all this stuff?

117
00:06:05,097 --> 00:06:05,964
-Never mind that!

118
00:06:05,997 --> 00:06:07,031
Let's focus on the fight!

119
00:06:12,297 --> 00:06:12,831
KAZUKI: OW.

120
00:06:12,864 --> 00:06:14,031
Ow ow ow ow ow.

121
00:06:14,064 --> 00:06:15,231
TOKIKO: Are you OK?

122
00:06:15,264 --> 00:06:16,231
KAZUKI: I am, but wow.

123
00:06:16,264 --> 00:06:17,664
I never thought
it'd be like this.

124
00:06:17,697 --> 00:06:19,597
I mean, I blocked it
with a bamboo sword

125
00:06:19,631 --> 00:06:21,364
and I was wearing my body armor.

126
00:06:21,397 --> 00:06:23,064
-We were once told
by a master swordsman

127
00:06:23,097 --> 00:06:25,364
that if my brother were
to use his reverse do

128
00:06:25,397 --> 00:06:28,331
with a real sword, it would cut
through a body, double swords

129
00:06:28,364 --> 00:06:31,897
and all, right in half.

130
00:06:31,931 --> 00:06:33,931
-This is the first
time someone's

131
00:06:33,964 --> 00:06:35,864
been able to block
my reverse do.

132
00:06:35,897 --> 00:06:38,097
And with the bamboo
sword on top of it.

133
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:39,264
Thanks for the work out.

134
00:06:39,297 --> 00:06:40,464
-The same face.

135
00:06:40,497 --> 00:06:42,031
-You must be twins.

136
00:06:42,064 --> 00:06:45,997
-Yes, but we're fraternal twins,
so we don't look exactly alike.

137
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:48,497
-I'd like to ask you something.

138
00:06:48,531 --> 00:06:51,597
Why did you offer to
be my sparring partner?

139
00:06:51,631 --> 00:06:53,231
-Because of what
you said before.

140
00:06:53,264 --> 00:06:55,864
I really wanna get as strong
as I possibly can too.

141
00:06:55,897 --> 00:06:57,997
That's my main goal right now.

142
00:06:58,031 --> 00:06:59,097
-Why'd that?

143
00:06:59,131 --> 00:07:00,064
-Sorry.

144
00:07:00,097 --> 00:07:00,864
Big secret.

145
00:07:00,897 --> 00:07:02,197
I can't really talk about it.

146
00:07:02,231 --> 00:07:04,397
What about you?

147
00:07:04,431 --> 00:07:07,697
-Well, I guess I'll keep
my reasons a secret too.

148
00:07:07,731 --> 00:07:09,764
I'm Shisui Hayasaka
I'm wondering

149
00:07:09,797 --> 00:07:12,631
if you'd like to spar
with me again sometime.

150
00:07:12,664 --> 00:07:13,564
-Kazuki Muto.

151
00:07:13,597 --> 00:07:14,264
Sure.

152
00:07:14,297 --> 00:07:15,497
I'd like that very much.

153
00:07:15,531 --> 00:07:17,731
I can't do it every day,
but feel free to ask.

154
00:07:25,431 --> 00:07:26,497
MOONFACE: Password?

155
00:07:26,531 --> 00:07:27,164
In one hand--

156
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:27,931
PAPILLON: A pistol.

157
00:07:27,964 --> 00:07:28,964
MOONFACE: In one's heart--

158
00:07:28,997 --> 00:07:30,431
PAPILLON: A bouquet of flowers.

159
00:07:30,464 --> 00:07:31,597
-On one's lush lips.

160
00:07:31,631 --> 00:07:33,064
Liquor of fire.

161
00:07:33,097 --> 00:07:34,231
MOONFACE: On one's back?

162
00:07:34,264 --> 00:07:35,731
PAPILLON: Life.

163
00:07:35,764 --> 00:07:38,664
So, what is it you
wanted to ask me?

164
00:07:38,697 --> 00:07:41,464
-It's been a week since
Jinnai disappeared.

165
00:07:41,497 --> 00:07:44,664
Surely an Alchemist Warrior
has taken care of him.

166
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:47,364
We still don't know about
the group's background.

167
00:07:47,397 --> 00:07:49,564
One of them is a
student in your school,

168
00:07:49,597 --> 00:07:52,231
but their identities
remain unknown.

169
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:54,731
You obviously know something.

170
00:07:54,764 --> 00:07:55,564
Tell us.

171
00:07:55,597 --> 00:07:58,131
Who is this Alchemist Warrior?

172
00:07:58,164 --> 00:07:59,797
-I've no intention of answering.

173
00:07:59,831 --> 00:08:04,397
He's someone I have
to defeat for my sake.

174
00:08:04,431 --> 00:08:07,864
-Well, that's an
answer I anticipated.

175
00:08:07,897 --> 00:08:10,397
I guess I'll have to
send in a team of my own.

176
00:08:10,431 --> 00:08:11,664
MOONFACE: Give me the password.

177
00:08:11,697 --> 00:08:12,664
In one hand--

178
00:08:12,697 --> 00:08:14,631
-A pistol.

179
00:08:14,664 --> 00:08:17,031
-Your mission is to find
the Alchemist Warrior

180
00:08:17,064 --> 00:08:20,931
hiding in Ginsei Academy
and eliminate him,

181
00:08:20,964 --> 00:08:24,297
but do it quietly and
behind closed doors.

182
00:08:24,331 --> 00:08:27,431
That place is the venue for
the special banquet celebrating

183
00:08:27,464 --> 00:08:28,964
his resurrection.

184
00:08:28,997 --> 00:08:32,531
I'd like to avoid causing
any unnecessary uproar.

185
00:08:32,564 --> 00:08:35,731
I'll leave the Kakugane
with you for this mission.

186
00:08:35,764 --> 00:08:38,731
If you succeed, they
are yours to keep.

187
00:08:38,764 --> 00:08:43,131
And also, I'll grant
your dearest wish.

188
00:08:43,164 --> 00:08:44,631
-The chance you're
been waiting for.

189
00:08:44,664 --> 00:08:47,264
Good luck to the both of you.

190
00:08:47,297 --> 00:08:48,564
PAPILLON: A wish?

191
00:08:48,597 --> 00:08:50,397
-It's not of your concern.

192
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:51,264
-Oh really?

193
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:53,664
Now I'm super curious.

194
00:08:53,697 --> 00:08:54,231
-Well.

195
00:08:54,264 --> 00:08:55,564
Super perfect.

196
00:08:55,597 --> 00:08:58,297
Then I'll give you a
mission to do as well.

197
00:08:58,331 --> 00:09:00,264
Observe those two and
inform me if there's

198
00:09:00,297 --> 00:09:01,764
any suspicious activity.

199
00:09:01,797 --> 00:09:03,997
-A watcher, huh?

200
00:09:04,031 --> 00:09:06,864
Like the two you sent to
keep an eye on me, right?

201
00:09:06,897 --> 00:09:08,364
-Nothing personal.

202
00:09:08,397 --> 00:09:10,331
I just want to take
all possible measures

203
00:09:10,364 --> 00:09:13,364
for his sake and
his safe return.

204
00:09:13,397 --> 00:09:15,464
[crash]

205
00:09:15,497 --> 00:09:17,664
-Ni hao, buddy buddy siblings.

206
00:09:17,697 --> 00:09:19,064
-So we heard.

207
00:09:19,097 --> 00:09:20,631
Seems you've been
assigned to get rid

208
00:09:20,664 --> 00:09:22,464
of the Alchemist Warrior, huh?

209
00:09:22,497 --> 00:09:23,931
KAZUKI (VOICEOVER): Tai and Shi.

210
00:09:23,964 --> 00:09:25,831
The giants of the LXE.

211
00:09:25,864 --> 00:09:27,631
-I can't accept that at all.

212
00:09:27,664 --> 00:09:29,331
We should've been
given the next mission.

213
00:09:29,364 --> 00:09:30,264
Not you.

214
00:09:30,297 --> 00:09:31,264
I want to know
why did he ask you

215
00:09:31,297 --> 00:09:32,731
guys who are lowest in rank!

216
00:09:32,764 --> 00:09:35,231
-Well, since we're students,
we don't stand out,

217
00:09:35,264 --> 00:09:37,564
which means we're best
suited for this mission.

218
00:09:37,597 --> 00:09:39,164
-Are you kidding me?

219
00:09:39,197 --> 00:09:41,264
Even if you're suited for
it, it would be dreadful

220
00:09:41,297 --> 00:09:43,831
if you were to lose or
the Kakugane were taken.

221
00:09:43,864 --> 00:09:45,364
The only thing
you two need to do

222
00:09:45,397 --> 00:09:48,631
is carry out your search for
the Warrior and locate him.

223
00:09:48,664 --> 00:09:49,564
Now hand it over.

224
00:09:55,764 --> 00:09:57,331
-Do not get in our way.

225
00:09:57,364 --> 00:09:59,064
And keep your hands
off my sister.

226
00:09:59,097 --> 00:10:00,931
-Shisui, no!

227
00:10:00,964 --> 00:10:02,531
-Wow, look at your hand.

228
00:10:02,564 --> 00:10:03,864
It's stuck to the wall.

229
00:10:03,897 --> 00:10:04,897
-Just shut up.

230
00:10:04,931 --> 00:10:06,097
-I'm sorry.

231
00:10:06,131 --> 00:10:07,731
I'll have a talk with my
little brother about this.

232
00:10:07,764 --> 00:10:09,064
I promise.

233
00:10:09,097 --> 00:10:11,364
As for the mission, we
don't have the authority

234
00:10:11,397 --> 00:10:13,197
to make any changes,
so you'll have

235
00:10:13,231 --> 00:10:15,664
to speak directly
with Dr. Butterfly.

236
00:10:15,697 --> 00:10:16,964
-Damn it all.

237
00:10:16,997 --> 00:10:18,264
If only we had a Kakugane.

238
00:10:18,297 --> 00:10:19,931
-What do you say we
waste those siblings

239
00:10:19,964 --> 00:10:21,964
and take the Kakugane from them?

240
00:10:21,997 --> 00:10:23,131
-Sure, why not.

241
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,697
Maybe if we carry
out the mission,

242
00:10:24,731 --> 00:10:26,697
Dr. Butterfly will
probably accept it

243
00:10:26,731 --> 00:10:28,331
and we'll get what we want.

244
00:10:28,364 --> 00:10:29,897
-But that little
brother's turning out

245
00:10:29,931 --> 00:10:31,497
to be quite troublesome.

246
00:10:31,531 --> 00:10:33,131
Despite being the
low rank that he is,

247
00:10:33,164 --> 00:10:34,964
he's been steadily
boosting his strength.

248
00:10:34,997 --> 00:10:35,597
-Ha.

249
00:10:35,631 --> 00:10:36,597
No sweat.

250
00:10:36,631 --> 00:10:37,997
We can just snuff
out the older sister

251
00:10:38,031 --> 00:10:39,264
and take away the Kakugane.

252
00:10:43,431 --> 00:10:44,831
OUKA: There's
absolutely no chance

253
00:10:44,864 --> 00:10:48,164
that Dr. Butterfly would assign
those two to this mission.

254
00:10:48,197 --> 00:10:51,131
He wants absolute discretion
for this operation.

255
00:10:51,164 --> 00:10:53,364
Those two couldn't get
anywhere near the Academy

256
00:10:53,397 --> 00:10:54,931
without being caught.

257
00:10:54,964 --> 00:10:56,364
There's no need
to worry, brother.

258
00:10:56,397 --> 00:10:58,397
This mission is ours.

259
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:01,231
We have to find the Alchemist
Warrior and kill him.

260
00:11:01,264 --> 00:11:02,964
And if we do that, then--

261
00:11:02,997 --> 00:11:04,131
- --our wish will come true.

262
00:11:17,497 --> 00:11:20,031
-Wow, my brother's on fire!

263
00:11:20,064 --> 00:11:23,264
-But this isn't even close
to kendo training anymore.

264
00:11:30,364 --> 00:11:31,831
-A reverse do.

265
00:11:31,864 --> 00:11:33,764
-And it was one handed to boot.

266
00:11:33,797 --> 00:11:36,197
-Are you OK, Kazuki?

267
00:11:36,231 --> 00:11:36,697
-I'm OK.

268
00:11:39,964 --> 00:11:42,631
You've gotten stronger, Shisui.

269
00:11:42,664 --> 00:11:44,631
But I sure gave it my best.

270
00:11:44,664 --> 00:11:46,064
-He's burned out!

271
00:11:46,097 --> 00:11:47,497
-You are the best!

272
00:11:47,531 --> 00:11:49,864
-Oh, Shisui Hayasaka!

273
00:11:49,897 --> 00:11:51,964
-Boy, women are so cruel.

274
00:11:51,997 --> 00:11:53,331
-That's another
reason why nobody

275
00:11:53,364 --> 00:11:55,964
likes to be Shusui's opponent,
even if they are good.

276
00:11:55,997 --> 00:11:58,031
It just boosts his popularity.

277
00:11:58,064 --> 00:11:58,964
-How dare you?

278
00:11:58,997 --> 00:12:00,331
Kazuki's an amateur.

279
00:12:00,364 --> 00:12:03,464
You could've at least
gone a little easy on him.

280
00:12:03,497 --> 00:12:04,264
-Sorry.

281
00:12:04,297 --> 00:12:07,164
I guess I got carried away.

282
00:12:07,197 --> 00:12:10,231
-His own little sister is
the cruelest of them all.

283
00:12:10,264 --> 00:12:12,564
-Kazuki really did
such an oustanding job.

284
00:12:12,597 --> 00:12:14,897
He probably should
join our club.

285
00:12:14,931 --> 00:12:16,864
-You all right, Kazuki?

286
00:12:16,897 --> 00:12:17,931
-Yeah, I'm OK.

287
00:12:17,964 --> 00:12:19,797
I'm just a little
frustrated, that's all.

288
00:12:19,831 --> 00:12:21,264
Even though a whole
week's passed,

289
00:12:21,297 --> 00:12:23,364
I still can't defend
your reverse do.

290
00:12:23,397 --> 00:12:24,364
-Are you kidding?

291
00:12:24,397 --> 00:12:25,931
You're definitely
getting stronger.

292
00:12:25,964 --> 00:12:27,931
But of course, I am too.

293
00:12:27,964 --> 00:12:32,264
It appears we just bring
out the best in each other.

294
00:12:32,297 --> 00:12:33,864
TOKIKO (VOICEOVER):
His basic training

295
00:12:33,897 --> 00:12:36,897
as an Alchemist Warrior, coupled
with sparring sessions, which

296
00:12:36,931 --> 00:12:39,664
is much more like
pseudo-combat than kendo.

297
00:12:39,697 --> 00:12:40,764
But more importantly--

298
00:12:40,797 --> 00:12:42,364
KAZUKI (VOICEOVER):
Right now, I just want

299
00:12:42,397 --> 00:12:44,997
to become as strong
as I possibly can.

300
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:46,931
-He's got the drive
to see it all through.

301
00:12:50,697 --> 00:12:51,697
MAN: All right, then.

302
00:12:51,731 --> 00:12:53,731
Please lock up and
turn off the lights.

303
00:12:53,764 --> 00:12:54,831
OUKA: Yes sir, will do.

304
00:12:57,697 --> 00:12:59,664
The Alchemist Warriors
wouldn't have come here

305
00:12:59,697 --> 00:13:02,964
unless they detected
Koushaku Chouno's activities,

306
00:13:02,997 --> 00:13:06,664
so it's likely that it's someone
associated with this school.

307
00:13:06,697 --> 00:13:08,864
Someone who came here after
the start of the year,

308
00:13:08,897 --> 00:13:11,364
making them relatively new.

309
00:13:11,397 --> 00:13:13,597
First there are the
newly appointed teachers,

310
00:13:13,631 --> 00:13:16,131
new students, and
transfer students.

311
00:13:22,828 --> 00:13:23,461
-Oh.

312
00:13:23,495 --> 00:13:25,428
Is everyone going home?

313
00:13:25,461 --> 00:13:26,695
-You too, Ouka?

314
00:13:26,728 --> 00:13:27,828
-Yes.

315
00:13:27,861 --> 00:13:29,261
I was pressed with some
student counsel work,

316
00:13:29,295 --> 00:13:30,195
and it took awhile.

317
00:13:30,228 --> 00:13:31,361
Shall we go home together?

318
00:13:31,395 --> 00:13:32,361
-Oh.

319
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:33,928
But we sweat quite
a bit today, so we

320
00:13:33,961 --> 00:13:37,328
were all thinking of stopping
by the public bath now.

321
00:13:37,361 --> 00:13:40,728
-Well maybe, in that case,
I'll just go with you guys.

322
00:13:43,928 --> 00:13:47,261
-30, 21, 31.

323
00:13:47,295 --> 00:13:50,428
My Mahiro eye's pretty
awesome, don't you think?

324
00:13:50,461 --> 00:13:51,095
-What?

325
00:13:51,128 --> 00:13:52,061
What are you doing?

326
00:13:52,095 --> 00:13:53,495
-You don't have
to be embarrassed.

327
00:13:53,528 --> 00:13:55,261
We're all girls here, right?

328
00:13:55,295 --> 00:13:58,528
-That's not the issue here.

329
00:13:58,561 --> 00:13:59,495
-Let's see.

330
00:13:59,528 --> 00:14:02,928
Ouka Hayasaka here is-- Wow, 34!

331
00:14:02,961 --> 00:14:05,861
-Hey, you girls both stay
in the dorms, don't you?

332
00:14:05,895 --> 00:14:07,261
What about your families?

333
00:14:07,295 --> 00:14:08,395
MAHIRO: Hm.

334
00:14:08,428 --> 00:14:11,761
Well, both my parents
are working abroad.

335
00:14:11,795 --> 00:14:14,661
-What about your family, Tokiko?

336
00:14:14,695 --> 00:14:15,528
-I don't have one.

337
00:14:15,561 --> 00:14:17,528
They passed away
a long time ago.

338
00:14:17,561 --> 00:14:18,161
-Oh my.

339
00:14:18,195 --> 00:14:19,195
I'm so sorry.

340
00:14:19,228 --> 00:14:20,395
-It's OK.

341
00:14:20,428 --> 00:14:22,261
I don't want people
worrying about me, anyway.

342
00:14:22,295 --> 00:14:24,228
-And what about
your family, Ouka?

343
00:14:24,261 --> 00:14:25,428
-It's a secret.

344
00:14:25,461 --> 00:14:28,428
The good news is now I
live together with Shusui.

345
00:14:28,461 --> 00:14:29,561
MAHIRO: I see.

346
00:14:29,595 --> 00:14:32,195
That's why you siblings
get along so well, huh?

347
00:14:32,228 --> 00:14:35,695
-Well, you and Kazuki also get
along very well, don't you?

348
00:14:35,728 --> 00:14:37,428
But aren't you actually
a little jealous

349
00:14:37,461 --> 00:14:40,628
that your big brother's got
a girlfriend like Tokiko?

350
00:14:40,661 --> 00:14:41,628
Come on, tell the truth.

351
00:14:41,661 --> 00:14:42,495
It's OK.

352
00:14:42,528 --> 00:14:43,528
-Mm.

353
00:14:43,561 --> 00:14:45,461
But if Tokiko became
my sister-in-law--

354
00:14:45,495 --> 00:14:46,695
-Oh, I see how it is.

355
00:14:46,728 --> 00:14:48,795
That way, you get to keep
the best of both worlds.

356
00:14:48,828 --> 00:14:50,995
-Kazuki and I are not in
that kind of relationship!

357
00:14:51,028 --> 00:14:52,661
Ah!

358
00:14:52,695 --> 00:14:53,795
-Wait a sec.

359
00:14:53,828 --> 00:14:55,495
Kazuki isn't getting in
shape to protect you?

360
00:14:55,528 --> 00:14:58,061
I was sure he was, because
it's become so dangerous.

361
00:14:58,095 --> 00:14:59,895
Around here, one
just never knows.

362
00:14:59,928 --> 00:15:02,495
People disappearing,
and-- but wait.

363
00:15:02,528 --> 00:15:04,728
That must be what
Shusui's doing, right?

364
00:15:04,761 --> 00:15:05,828
-I guess so.

365
00:15:05,861 --> 00:15:08,461
After all, it's
just the two of us.

366
00:15:08,495 --> 00:15:11,695
And we only have each other.

367
00:15:11,728 --> 00:15:12,761
-Come on!

368
00:15:12,795 --> 00:15:14,761
Having top grades in
class, being athletic,

369
00:15:14,795 --> 00:15:17,828
and having good looks all at the
same time is simply impossible!

370
00:15:17,861 --> 00:15:19,561
-How can you so sure about that?

371
00:15:19,595 --> 00:15:20,728
-Nobody is that perfect.

372
00:15:20,761 --> 00:15:23,161
I'm sure he's gotta
be hiding something.

373
00:15:23,195 --> 00:15:24,861
-Like what?

374
00:15:24,895 --> 00:15:27,195
-Well, like, uh--

375
00:15:27,228 --> 00:15:28,261
-Bigger than Okakura.

376
00:15:28,295 --> 00:15:30,495
Smaller than Kazuki.

377
00:15:30,528 --> 00:15:33,595
-Bigger than Kazuki,
smaller than Daihama.

378
00:15:33,628 --> 00:15:36,361
-Bigger than Okakura,
smaller than Rokumasu.

379
00:15:36,395 --> 00:15:38,595
-Bigger than Rokumasu,
smaller than Kazuki.

380
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:46,028
-That's just beautiful!

381
00:15:48,828 --> 00:15:51,761
-The guy is absolutely flawless.

382
00:15:51,795 --> 00:15:53,728
-He's the ultimate.

383
00:15:53,761 --> 00:15:55,161
-The ultimate stud.

384
00:15:55,195 --> 00:15:58,228
-Now if he'd just put
on a mask like this,

385
00:15:58,261 --> 00:16:00,195
he'd be the super ultimate stud.

386
00:16:00,228 --> 00:16:02,128
-Ah!

387
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:06,495
-Don't you know it's rude to
make a racket at a public bath?

388
00:16:06,528 --> 00:16:07,961
Hey, sure.

389
00:16:07,995 --> 00:16:10,661
It seems you've been
getting stronger lately.

390
00:16:10,695 --> 00:16:15,028
-And it seems you've
finally obtained a Kakugane.

391
00:16:15,061 --> 00:16:16,361
-I guess.

392
00:16:16,395 --> 00:16:18,861
But as you can obviously
see, it doesn't

393
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:21,428
appear that I have brought
it with me into the bath.

394
00:16:21,461 --> 00:16:23,595
Do you want to battle
without, anyway?

395
00:16:23,628 --> 00:16:25,295
-Now that wouldn't
be fair, would it?

396
00:16:25,328 --> 00:16:27,061
We're supposed to fight
it out after we're

397
00:16:27,095 --> 00:16:27,895
thoroughly prepared.

398
00:16:27,928 --> 00:16:29,061
Isn't that the pact?

399
00:16:29,095 --> 00:16:31,661
-There you go,
ever the hypocrite.

400
00:16:31,695 --> 00:16:33,161
-Say whatever you want.

401
00:16:33,195 --> 00:16:35,295
I'm just gonna go on being me.

402
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:36,328
-Ah, yes.

403
00:16:36,361 --> 00:16:38,761
That's the Kazuki
Muto I must defeat.

404
00:16:42,695 --> 00:16:43,861
Stay alert.

405
00:16:43,895 --> 00:16:47,261
The hand of the enemy is
getting closer and closer.

406
00:16:47,295 --> 00:16:47,761
-What?

407
00:16:53,161 --> 00:16:54,328
-That's weird.

408
00:16:54,361 --> 00:16:56,628
-I've never seen anything
like that before.

409
00:16:56,661 --> 00:17:00,061
-Never seen that before
in a public shower.

410
00:17:00,095 --> 00:17:01,361
-Shh.

411
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:02,628
SHUSUI (VOICEOVER): A watcher.

412
00:17:02,661 --> 00:17:04,328
I knew we were being followed.

413
00:17:04,361 --> 00:17:06,661
-Attendant, one fruit
flavored milkshake, please.

414
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:11,728
-Isn't that the weirdo
with the butterfly mask?

415
00:17:11,761 --> 00:17:12,861
-He really does exist.

416
00:17:12,895 --> 00:17:14,795
I thought it was just a rumor.

417
00:17:14,828 --> 00:17:17,461
-Kazuki, what were you
guys just talking about?

418
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:21,628
-Talking about how bad
security is in this town.

419
00:17:21,661 --> 00:17:23,995
BOY: You liar!

420
00:17:24,028 --> 00:17:25,228
OUKA: I see.

421
00:17:25,261 --> 00:17:26,895
So Papillon is the watcher.

422
00:17:26,928 --> 00:17:28,628
-I could just wipe him out.

423
00:17:28,661 --> 00:17:29,628
-Now, now, brother.

424
00:17:29,661 --> 00:17:31,795
Don't be saying
such violent things.

425
00:17:31,828 --> 00:17:33,428
But if we've got
a watcher on us,

426
00:17:33,461 --> 00:17:36,495
the slightest mistake could
cause us to be dismissed.

427
00:17:36,528 --> 00:17:40,061
So we need to be more careful.

428
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:41,128
BRAVO: I see.

429
00:17:41,161 --> 00:17:43,495
So, Papillon gave
you a warning, huh?

430
00:17:43,528 --> 00:17:45,195
-But do you think
we can trust him?

431
00:17:45,228 --> 00:17:46,861
-We probably can.

432
00:17:46,895 --> 00:17:49,761
He maintains a peculiar
respect for Kazuki.

433
00:17:49,795 --> 00:17:51,261
For the time being,
just try to be

434
00:17:51,295 --> 00:17:52,895
more alert than you have been.

435
00:17:52,928 --> 00:17:54,028
-Understand.

436
00:17:54,061 --> 00:17:56,161
I'll patrol the inside
of the school building,

437
00:17:56,195 --> 00:17:58,928
and if I find in an enemy,
I'll kill him immediately.

438
00:17:58,961 --> 00:18:01,761
-Well, I would like to
interrogate them about the LXE,

439
00:18:01,795 --> 00:18:04,295
so I prefer that
you take them alive.

440
00:18:04,328 --> 00:18:06,961
But remember, your
highest priority is--

441
00:18:06,995 --> 00:18:09,328
-To avoid victims at all costs.

442
00:18:09,361 --> 00:18:10,361
-Bravo.

443
00:18:10,395 --> 00:18:10,861
Exactly.

444
00:18:14,361 --> 00:18:15,361
-Here, huh?

445
00:18:15,395 --> 00:18:16,028
-That's right.

446
00:18:16,061 --> 00:18:17,861
Let's go.

447
00:18:17,895 --> 00:18:19,861
-Who are they?

448
00:18:19,895 --> 00:18:21,461
-A perfect disguise.

449
00:18:21,495 --> 00:18:23,828
-Yeah, we'll never
arouse suspicion.

450
00:18:23,861 --> 00:18:25,395
-Those two are weird.

451
00:18:25,428 --> 00:18:26,561
-They look very suspicious.

452
00:18:26,595 --> 00:18:28,495
-Totally suspicious.

453
00:18:28,528 --> 00:18:30,295
-A totally suspicious pair?

454
00:18:30,328 --> 00:18:31,961
-Aw, yeah, you gotta see them.

455
00:18:31,995 --> 00:18:33,895
Come check 'em out, guys!

456
00:18:33,928 --> 00:18:34,428
-Could it be?

457
00:18:34,461 --> 00:18:35,661
-Tai and Shi?

458
00:18:35,695 --> 00:18:37,161
-The enemy Chouno spoke of.

459
00:18:37,195 --> 00:18:38,228
-What's going on?

460
00:18:38,261 --> 00:18:39,895
The school's in an uproar.

461
00:18:39,928 --> 00:18:41,828
-My, this is a first.

462
00:18:41,861 --> 00:18:44,161
So you're not with
Kazuki Muto today, huh?

463
00:18:44,195 --> 00:18:46,961
-I told you, Kazuki and I
are not a couple, all right?

464
00:18:46,995 --> 00:18:48,528
-Well, your timing
is perfect, since I

465
00:18:48,561 --> 00:18:51,795
wanted to continue our talk from
last night a little bit more.

466
00:18:51,828 --> 00:18:52,795
-Hm.

467
00:18:52,828 --> 00:18:53,295
-Huh?

468
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:58,695
-I found her.

469
00:18:58,728 --> 00:19:00,161
-Now the Kakugane is ours!

470
00:19:02,995 --> 00:19:04,195
TOKIKO (VOICEOVER): Homunculi?

471
00:19:04,228 --> 00:19:06,661
I never thought they'd
attack in broad daylight.

472
00:19:06,695 --> 00:19:07,928
-Hold it right there!

473
00:19:07,961 --> 00:19:10,961
-Looks like the little
brother has arrived.

474
00:19:10,995 --> 00:19:12,795
-But who's that other kids?

475
00:19:12,828 --> 00:19:15,228
OUKA (VOICEOVER): The mission
must be behind closed doors.

476
00:19:15,261 --> 00:19:16,528
-Dammit.

477
00:19:16,561 --> 00:19:18,061
The slightest mistake could
cause us to be dismissed.

478
00:19:18,095 --> 00:19:19,195
TOKIKO (VOICEOVER): Dammit.

479
00:19:19,228 --> 00:19:21,461
We mustn't involve
the civilians here,

480
00:19:21,495 --> 00:19:24,028
which means we can't
use our Buso Renkin.

481
00:19:24,061 --> 00:19:24,761
-Buso Renkin!

482
00:19:29,228 --> 00:19:29,828
Run, Ouka!

483
00:19:29,861 --> 00:19:31,728
Run now!

484
00:19:31,761 --> 00:19:33,695
Sunlight Flasher!

485
00:19:33,728 --> 00:19:36,161
-It's a blinding attack!

486
00:19:36,195 --> 00:19:38,095
-Come and get me, Homunculi!

487
00:19:38,128 --> 00:19:39,295
Shusui, stay with Ouka.

488
00:19:39,328 --> 00:19:39,795
Go!

489
00:19:39,828 --> 00:19:40,528
Go, now!

490
00:19:40,561 --> 00:19:41,195
Move!

491
00:19:41,228 --> 00:19:43,795
-You're in the way!

492
00:19:43,828 --> 00:19:45,795
-Tai, it looks like it's
time to change targets.

493
00:19:45,828 --> 00:19:46,328
-I know.

494
00:19:46,361 --> 00:19:47,295
It's great.

495
00:19:47,328 --> 00:19:48,595
An Alchemist Warrior
has appeared.

496
00:19:48,628 --> 00:19:50,295
Now we have no use
for those siblings.

497
00:19:50,328 --> 00:19:51,961
-I remember from
Jinnai's report the one

498
00:19:51,995 --> 00:19:54,028
using the spear is
only half a warrior.

499
00:19:54,061 --> 00:19:55,761
So I think we can manage.

500
00:19:55,795 --> 00:19:59,028
[fire alarm]

501
00:19:59,061 --> 00:19:59,828
BOY: Fire?

502
00:19:59,861 --> 00:20:01,161
GIRL: Maybe it's a prank.

503
00:20:01,195 --> 00:20:02,561
TEACHER: All right,
students line up--

504
00:20:02,595 --> 00:20:03,595
TOKIKO (VOICEOVER): Now we can
clear people out of the school

505
00:20:03,628 --> 00:20:05,095
until the fire
department gets here.

506
00:20:05,128 --> 00:20:06,761
In the meantime--

507
00:20:06,795 --> 00:20:08,128
-You guys stay there.

508
00:20:08,161 --> 00:20:09,895
I'll explain later.

509
00:20:09,928 --> 00:20:11,328
-I knew it.

510
00:20:11,361 --> 00:20:12,728
She's an Alchemist Warrior, too.

511
00:20:15,761 --> 00:20:17,495
-They're right behind me!

512
00:20:17,528 --> 00:20:19,095
-Kazuki, you impulsive idiot!

513
00:20:19,128 --> 00:20:21,495
You can't use your Buso
Renkin as you please.

514
00:20:21,528 --> 00:20:22,695
-Sorry, couldn't help it.

515
00:20:22,728 --> 00:20:24,395
-Couldn't help
it's not an answer!

516
00:20:24,428 --> 00:20:25,561
-What about Ouka and Shusui?

517
00:20:25,595 --> 00:20:27,128
Do you know if
they're all right?

518
00:20:27,161 --> 00:20:28,061
-They're OK.

519
00:20:28,095 --> 00:20:29,295
They don't seem to
be very shocked.

520
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:31,161
In fact, they seem very normal.

521
00:20:31,195 --> 00:20:32,561
TOKIKO (VOICEOVER): Very normal?

522
00:20:32,595 --> 00:20:34,928
After being attacked by two
monstrous looking things

523
00:20:34,961 --> 00:20:37,928
and witnessing the Buso
Renkin with their own eyes?

524
00:20:37,961 --> 00:20:39,828
Behind you, KazukI!

525
00:20:39,861 --> 00:20:42,528
-First I'll be taking your life!

526
00:20:42,561 --> 00:20:45,495
[shout]

527
00:20:49,995 --> 00:20:52,195
KAZUKI (VOICEOVER): This
Homunculus is very strong.

528
00:20:52,228 --> 00:20:54,528
But I'm also a little
stronger than before.

529
00:20:54,561 --> 00:20:57,495
[shout]

530
00:20:57,528 --> 00:20:58,961
-Just get out of the way, Shi!

531
00:20:58,995 --> 00:21:01,261
Your Rain of Blows technique
is annoying to watch.

532
00:21:01,295 --> 00:21:05,461
It's better just to take him
out with one good, solid punch!

533
00:21:05,495 --> 00:21:07,661
[shout]

534
00:21:07,695 --> 00:21:09,795
TOKIKO (VOICEOVER): His
fighting style has changed.

535
00:21:09,828 --> 00:21:11,728
What were once
mainly charge attacks

536
00:21:11,761 --> 00:21:14,395
is now a skillful lance
control in response

537
00:21:14,428 --> 00:21:15,761
to the enemy's movement.

538
00:21:15,795 --> 00:21:18,528
The experience he's
gained in actual battle,

539
00:21:18,561 --> 00:21:20,795
in addition to his special
training with the Warrior

540
00:21:20,828 --> 00:21:23,461
Chief, the sparring
with Shisui Hayasaka,

541
00:21:23,495 --> 00:21:26,028
and his will to become
stronger have all

542
00:21:26,061 --> 00:21:27,995
come together to become one.

543
00:21:28,028 --> 00:21:31,728
-Kid, don't you be
getting carried away!

544
00:21:31,761 --> 00:21:33,028
-What?

545
00:21:33,061 --> 00:21:34,128
-This wound?

546
00:21:34,161 --> 00:21:37,461
Could it have been
inflicted from that time?

547
00:21:37,495 --> 00:21:39,895
The mission's a
complete disaster!

548
00:21:39,928 --> 00:21:41,828
-I won't let you get away!

549
00:21:45,728 --> 00:21:48,661
[scream]

550
00:21:48,695 --> 00:21:49,161
-Tokiko!

551
00:21:52,128 --> 00:21:53,661
-Kazuki's opponent
was just killed

552
00:21:53,695 --> 00:21:55,195
from an attack made
by a Buso Renkin.

553
00:21:57,695 --> 00:21:59,795
Two different types
of Buso Renkin.

554
00:21:59,828 --> 00:22:02,428
It seems the real enemy
is a different duo.

555
00:22:02,461 --> 00:22:04,395
-I'm sorry I messed up.

556
00:22:04,428 --> 00:22:05,361
-It's OK.

557
00:22:05,395 --> 00:22:07,995
Now we've seen
their Buso Renkin.

558
00:22:08,028 --> 00:22:10,861
Neither of them
is a match for me.

559
00:22:10,895 --> 00:22:13,428
-The Hayasaka twins
are the enemy.

560
00:22:13,461 --> 00:22:15,328
The LXE.

561
00:22:15,361 --> 00:22:15,828
Homunculi.

562
00:22:23,606 --> 00:22:27,006
[theme music]

563
00:23:54,601 --> 00:23:57,201
TOKIKO: It slices at an
abnormal speed and sharpness,

564
00:23:57,234 --> 00:23:59,934
and even Kazuki's energy
attacks have no effect.

565
00:23:59,967 --> 00:24:04,167
Shisui Hayasaka, just what sort
of Buso Renkin do you have?

566
00:24:04,201 --> 00:24:06,934
Next episode, It Seems
We're Well Matched.

567
00:24:06,967 --> 00:24:10,467
I'll splatter your guts!
