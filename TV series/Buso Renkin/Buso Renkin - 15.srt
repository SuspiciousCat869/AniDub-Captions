NARRATOR: The supernatural
power produced

2
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:18,900
by gathering the essence
of alchemy is the kakugane.

3
00:00:18,933 --> 00:00:22,866
This device activates upon a
person's fighting instinct,

4
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,433
manifesting the
possessor's inner power

5
00:00:25,466 --> 00:00:30,633
into a tangible form creating
a weapon like no other.

6
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:32,500
It's name, Buso Renkin.

[theme music]

8
00:02:12,255 --> 00:02:13,622
-Kasuki.

9
00:02:13,655 --> 00:02:15,322
-I will fight.

10
00:02:15,355 --> 00:02:17,388
I will fight.

11
00:02:17,422 --> 00:02:19,822
-Kasuki.

12
00:02:19,855 --> 00:02:21,288
-I will fight.

13
00:02:21,322 --> 00:02:24,722
I will fight.

14
00:02:24,755 --> 00:02:25,722
-Damn it.

15
00:02:25,755 --> 00:02:27,688
What's happening up there?

16
00:02:34,055 --> 00:02:35,488
-I will fight.

17
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:36,955
I will fight.

18
00:02:36,988 --> 00:02:39,288
I will fight.

19
00:02:39,322 --> 00:02:40,755
Fight me!

20
00:02:40,788 --> 00:02:41,255
-Kazuki!

21
00:03:05,388 --> 00:03:08,955
TOKIKO (VOICEOVER): That olive
skin and that glowing hair,

22
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:11,655
he's just like Victor.

23
00:03:25,322 --> 00:03:27,722
-This is like breathing for me.

24
00:03:27,755 --> 00:03:30,522
It is not my power,
but my biology.

25
00:03:30,555 --> 00:03:32,688
I can't stop it
even if I wanted to.

26
00:03:40,755 --> 00:03:43,222
-More energy drain.

27
00:03:43,255 --> 00:03:45,188
Ka- su- ki.

28
00:03:53,622 --> 00:03:54,088
-Victor.

29
00:04:00,055 --> 00:04:09,122
Buso-- Come.

30
00:04:41,188 --> 00:04:45,755
-With the both of us like this,
this won't be a short battle,

31
00:04:45,788 --> 00:04:47,455
and I'm not sure who
would be the victor.

32
00:04:50,488 --> 00:04:54,388
It seems you are not
capable of flight yet.

33
00:04:54,422 --> 00:04:56,388
The fog's cleared.

34
00:04:56,422 --> 00:04:59,522
I prefer not to expose
the power of alchemy

35
00:04:59,555 --> 00:05:02,022
to the rest of the
world out there.

36
00:05:02,055 --> 00:05:07,388
This battle and this feeding
are over for now, warrior.

37
00:05:07,422 --> 00:05:09,855
A whole century has passed.

38
00:05:09,888 --> 00:05:12,522
I think I'll go
see this new world.

39
00:05:12,555 --> 00:05:14,188
-You running away?

40
00:05:14,222 --> 00:05:16,655
-There's no hurry.

41
00:05:16,688 --> 00:05:21,222
You and I are the closest thing
to immortality on this earth.

42
00:05:21,255 --> 00:05:23,688
We've got plenty of time.

43
00:05:23,722 --> 00:05:27,788
I'll come back to
settle things with you.

44
00:05:27,822 --> 00:05:29,322
And not just you.

45
00:05:29,355 --> 00:05:32,622
Alchemist warriors
and Homunculi.

46
00:05:32,655 --> 00:05:34,722
All thing's alchemy
has created will

47
00:05:34,755 --> 00:05:37,222
meet their end by my hands.

48
00:05:37,255 --> 00:05:40,922
Alchemy itself is my enemy.

49
00:05:40,955 --> 00:05:42,922
-Victor!

50
00:05:42,955 --> 00:05:46,755
-From this day forth, you
shall suffer the same hardships

51
00:05:46,788 --> 00:05:49,188
I endured a century ago.

52
00:05:49,222 --> 00:05:50,422
Prepare yourself.

53
00:05:56,188 --> 00:05:59,922
-Don't chase him, Kazuki.

54
00:05:59,955 --> 00:06:02,255
-Come back and fight, Victor.

55
00:06:09,288 --> 00:06:09,755
-Kazuki.

56
00:06:14,855 --> 00:06:15,822
I'm begging you, Kazuki.

57
00:06:25,722 --> 00:06:27,655
I'll do anything.

58
00:06:27,688 --> 00:06:29,788
It's my fault you've
turned into this.

59
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:31,655
I'll make it up to you.

60
00:06:31,688 --> 00:06:37,088
That's why I'm begging you.

61
00:06:37,122 --> 00:06:41,422
Even if you
transformed physically,

62
00:06:41,455 --> 00:06:45,055
please let your heart
remain unchanged.

63
00:06:45,088 --> 00:06:45,555
Please.

64
00:06:55,088 --> 00:06:55,555
-Tokiko.

65
00:07:08,022 --> 00:07:09,022
-Papillon.

66
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,288
-Chouno.

67
00:07:10,322 --> 00:07:12,388
-I saw everything, Muto.

68
00:07:12,422 --> 00:07:15,288
Never in a million years would
I have thought you of all people

69
00:07:15,322 --> 00:07:18,355
would have given
up your humanity.

70
00:07:18,388 --> 00:07:20,655
I'm not happy about
this Kazuki Muto,

71
00:07:20,688 --> 00:07:22,622
especially after all your
efforts to prevent me

72
00:07:22,655 --> 00:07:26,288
from casting off my humanity
and becoming something greater.

73
00:07:26,322 --> 00:07:28,688
And on top of it, you
killed me in the process.

74
00:07:28,722 --> 00:07:31,522
How dare you turn around and
give up your own humanity?

75
00:07:31,555 --> 00:07:32,022
Hypocrite!

76
00:07:36,288 --> 00:07:38,622
-You shouldn't over
exert yourself like that.

77
00:07:38,655 --> 00:07:40,155
Are you all right?

78
00:07:40,188 --> 00:07:43,355
-Shut up.

79
00:07:43,388 --> 00:07:44,622
-Chouno, listen.

80
00:07:44,655 --> 00:07:45,755
-What do you want?

81
00:07:45,788 --> 00:07:48,355
-I will never give
up my humanity.

82
00:07:48,388 --> 00:07:50,855
Look at me, I'm back
to normal, aren't I?

83
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:53,622
-And how do you know you're not
just in some kind of remission?

84
00:07:56,622 --> 00:07:59,388
If you're fighting instinct
is triggered again,

85
00:07:59,422 --> 00:08:02,488
how do you know that the black
kakugane embedded in your chest

86
00:08:02,522 --> 00:08:04,188
isn't going to activate then?

87
00:08:07,022 --> 00:08:08,988
You can believe whatever
you want to believe,

88
00:08:09,022 --> 00:08:12,622
but now, you're something
between a human and Victor.

89
00:08:12,655 --> 00:08:15,555
Go on, keep on living
in a fool's paradise.

90
00:08:15,588 --> 00:08:17,455
Muto, do you really
believe you could ever

91
00:08:17,488 --> 00:08:20,822
be truly human again?

92
00:08:20,855 --> 00:08:24,222
-The warrior chief might--

93
00:08:24,255 --> 00:08:25,188
-Tokiko?

94
00:08:25,222 --> 00:08:26,122
-It's OK.

95
00:08:26,155 --> 00:08:28,222
I'm fine.

96
00:08:28,255 --> 00:08:32,922
About that black kakugane
and what happened to Kazuki,

97
00:08:32,955 --> 00:08:35,588
the warrior chief might know.

98
00:08:35,622 --> 00:08:38,288
-Yes, I see now.

99
00:08:38,322 --> 00:08:40,322
Guess you minions have no clue.

100
00:08:40,355 --> 00:08:42,155
Perhaps, someone higher
up the food chain

101
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,322
might know something.

102
00:08:43,355 --> 00:08:44,522
-I'll kill you.

103
00:08:44,555 --> 00:08:46,622
-Go ahead and try.

104
00:08:49,655 --> 00:08:52,222
-OK, then, let's go.

105
00:08:52,255 --> 00:09:03,288
But before that, we need
to-- Everyone's asleep.

106
00:09:03,322 --> 00:09:04,922
TOKIKO: That's no surprise.

107
00:09:04,955 --> 00:09:07,788
They've been severely drained.

108
00:09:07,822 --> 00:09:09,555
-Still, I'm relieved.

109
00:09:09,588 --> 00:09:12,622
Everyone seems to be doing OK.

110
00:09:12,655 --> 00:09:14,688
-I finished making
the rounds, and there

111
00:09:14,722 --> 00:09:17,822
doesn't seem to
be any casualties.

112
00:09:17,855 --> 00:09:18,788
-That's good news.

113
00:09:18,822 --> 00:09:21,322
-What do you mean,
that's good news?

114
00:09:21,355 --> 00:09:23,788
You also inflicted
suffering on them

115
00:09:23,822 --> 00:09:26,655
and drained their energy
when you became like Victor.

116
00:09:26,688 --> 00:09:31,088
So don't try to act like a hero.

117
00:09:31,122 --> 00:09:34,255
You're headed to the
LXE hideout next, right?

118
00:09:34,288 --> 00:09:38,255
Then I guess I
will see you there.

119
00:09:38,288 --> 00:09:43,855
Papill-- What do you
think you're doing?

120
00:09:43,888 --> 00:09:45,555
-Just fly, Homunculus.

121
00:09:45,588 --> 00:09:46,788
Tokiko, hop on.

122
00:09:46,822 --> 00:09:47,888
Come on, hurry up.

123
00:09:47,922 --> 00:09:49,222
-Stop screwing around!

124
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:50,155
Oh, my leg.

125
00:09:50,188 --> 00:09:51,622
You'll tear it off.

126
00:09:51,655 --> 00:09:53,488
Let go of me.

127
00:09:53,522 --> 00:09:56,322
-Don't worry, I'm
excellent at hanging on.

128
00:09:56,355 --> 00:09:57,122
Just go.

129
00:09:57,155 --> 00:09:57,622
-Tokiko.

130
00:10:03,122 --> 00:10:06,322
If you're in a hurry,
go ahead and use it.

131
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:07,155
It's my treasure.

132
00:10:07,188 --> 00:10:09,555
It's parked behind the dorm.

133
00:10:09,588 --> 00:10:12,688
-Don't you know that's
again school rules?

134
00:10:12,722 --> 00:10:13,722
-Be careful.

135
00:10:13,755 --> 00:10:16,688
If you get caught,
you'll be suspended.

136
00:10:16,722 --> 00:10:17,722
-Thank you.

137
00:10:17,755 --> 00:10:18,555
I'll treat her well.

138
00:10:42,122 --> 00:10:46,355
-That other Buso Renkin of
yours is a wonderful design.

139
00:10:46,388 --> 00:10:50,455
But it's unfortunate, a Buso
Renkin specializing in defense

140
00:10:50,488 --> 00:10:54,422
is like a band-aid
over a bullet hole.

141
00:10:54,455 --> 00:10:57,555
Your subordinate held
out for two entire days.

142
00:10:57,588 --> 00:10:59,955
Now tell us, what
about you, Bravo?

143
00:10:59,988 --> 00:11:04,455
I wonder how long you
can entertain us for?

144
00:11:04,488 --> 00:11:07,288
-It seems I was being
a bit too hot-headed.

145
00:11:14,755 --> 00:11:15,222
-Oh.

146
00:11:28,244 --> 00:11:28,710
Oh.

147
00:11:38,944 --> 00:11:40,644
Oh.

148
00:11:40,677 --> 00:11:41,344
-What's this?

149
00:11:41,377 --> 00:11:42,810
What is going on?

150
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:05,277
Wah!

151
00:12:13,777 --> 00:12:16,877
Oh, another way you can
use your powers, huh?

152
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:18,344
I should have known
you'd be harder

153
00:12:18,377 --> 00:12:19,910
to deal with than
your subordinate.

154
00:12:19,944 --> 00:12:21,410
-Smash, bravo, crush.

155
00:12:35,444 --> 00:12:36,877
-Hey!

156
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:38,377
Hi, Tokiko.

157
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:39,877
-Hey, quit moving so much.

158
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,177
-You're falling behind.

159
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:42,144
-Did you hear that?

160
00:12:42,177 --> 00:12:43,610
She's basically
saying you're slow.

161
00:12:43,644 --> 00:12:45,244
-If it hadn't been
for you, we would've

162
00:12:45,277 --> 00:12:47,177
been there a long time ago.

163
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:50,444
-Kazuki, can you see the
hideout from up there?

164
00:12:50,477 --> 00:12:52,010
-Yes, I can see it.

165
00:12:52,044 --> 00:12:53,210
It's just a little further.

166
00:12:58,177 --> 00:12:59,610
-Well, this sure is a first.

167
00:12:59,644 --> 00:13:02,010
I've been defeated.

168
00:13:02,044 --> 00:13:02,577
KAZUKI: Bravo.

169
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:12,177
-I'm sorry.

170
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:15,077
I kind of my had my hands full.

171
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:19,244
A black kakugane and a
third type of being, huh?

172
00:13:19,277 --> 00:13:21,477
Hm, well, this is news to me.

173
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:21,977
-Really?

174
00:13:25,644 --> 00:13:29,544
-So he's just as ignorant
as you minions, after all.

175
00:13:29,577 --> 00:13:31,944
Oh, what a waste of time.

176
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,844
I guess I should
have known better.

177
00:13:33,877 --> 00:13:36,810
Well, if I want to learn
something new in this world,

178
00:13:36,844 --> 00:13:40,177
seems I'm better off
doing my own research.

179
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:43,277
-Is that restore Kazuki
back to his human form,

180
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:47,710
or maybe that research is to
turn yourself into a Victor.

181
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:51,144
-Actually, it's both, so
then the awesome super

182
00:13:51,177 --> 00:13:53,810
me will defeat the
human, Kazuki Muto.

183
00:13:53,844 --> 00:13:57,010
That's really the
only outcome I desire.

184
00:13:57,044 --> 00:14:01,444
So you better hold onto what's
left of your humanity, Muto.

185
00:14:01,477 --> 00:14:03,177
-Ha!

186
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:05,777
I really don't need
you to tell me that.

187
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:08,410
Just make sure you
heal that wound first.

188
00:14:08,444 --> 00:14:11,344
-You didn't care about that
when you were hanging on to me.

189
00:14:11,377 --> 00:14:13,544
-Hold on, you think
you can just get away?

190
00:14:13,577 --> 00:14:15,544
-Let him go, Warrior Tokiko.

191
00:14:15,577 --> 00:14:16,877
-But he--

192
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:20,477
-If he does his research, he
might be useful to us later.

193
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:23,077
Besides, you really don't
look like you're in any shape

194
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:26,444
to be fighting either, Tokiko.

195
00:14:26,477 --> 00:14:30,177
There's no need to overdo it,
so why don't we call it a day?

196
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:32,444
-Yes, OK.

197
00:14:32,477 --> 00:14:34,610
-Anyway, we've got
him to deal with.

198
00:14:34,644 --> 00:14:36,077
-Moon.

199
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:38,810
-I thought of taking
him to the LXE hearing,

200
00:14:38,844 --> 00:14:41,310
but if he was involved
in Victor's restoration,

201
00:14:41,344 --> 00:14:42,877
he might know something.

202
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:48,310
We'll be sure to have him tell
us everything we need to know.

203
00:14:48,344 --> 00:14:51,544
-I lost so I guess
I have no choice.

204
00:14:51,577 --> 00:14:53,177
FEMALE SPEAKER (ON
RADIO): We apologize

205
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:55,510
for interrupting our regular
coverage to bring you

206
00:14:55,544 --> 00:14:58,977
this important followup
special report.

207
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:02,377
The mass fainting incident
that occurred at Ginsei Academy

208
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:07,477
resulted in 42 hospitalizations
and 26 minor injuries.

209
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:10,810
In addition, the number of
students suffering from nausea

210
00:15:10,844 --> 00:15:12,810
and headache
continues to increase,

211
00:15:12,844 --> 00:15:19,944
and it's now close to 100.

212
00:15:19,977 --> 00:15:22,510
-I'm going back to headquarters.

213
00:15:22,544 --> 00:15:25,210
I intend to find out
everything I can about Victor,

214
00:15:25,244 --> 00:15:28,877
and also, what exactly
happened 100 years ago.

215
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:32,044
Rest assured, this
time I'll come back

216
00:15:32,077 --> 00:15:33,977
with some definite leads.

217
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:35,410
KAZUKI: OK.

218
00:15:35,444 --> 00:15:37,677
-It seems like you're more
concerned about the others

219
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:39,644
than yourself.

220
00:15:39,677 --> 00:15:40,810
I understand.

221
00:15:40,844 --> 00:15:42,310
The trauma from
what happened today

222
00:15:42,344 --> 00:15:44,910
will surely affect a
number of students.

223
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:48,377
Unfortunately, no matter
how strong warriors are,

224
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:50,810
there are some things that
even they cannot protect people

225
00:15:50,844 --> 00:15:51,610
from.

226
00:15:51,644 --> 00:15:53,244
But you what?

227
00:15:53,277 --> 00:15:55,810
You were able to
protect their lives.

228
00:15:55,844 --> 00:16:00,577
The LXE has been wiped out,
and this town has been svaed.

229
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:05,377
Bravo, Warrior Kazuki, Warrior
Tokiko, to the both of you.

230
00:16:08,477 --> 00:16:09,777
Mission accomplished.

231
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:14,877
Now, you both should
rest until I return.

232
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:15,710
-Ready?

233
00:16:15,744 --> 00:16:18,077
One, two, three, go.

234
00:16:22,644 --> 00:16:24,310
-First time being number three!

235
00:16:24,344 --> 00:16:26,077
-Thank god I'm second.

236
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,877
-First place as usually.

237
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:31,244
-Dead last.

238
00:16:31,277 --> 00:16:34,944
Oh, I can't believe I
even lost to Okakura.

239
00:16:34,977 --> 00:16:36,410
I mean, I had to
cut class because

240
00:16:36,444 --> 00:16:38,277
of that special training
and all that combat.

241
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:39,810
I was just too busy.

242
00:16:39,844 --> 00:16:41,477
I was busy, that's all.

243
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:45,177
But still, I--
how'd this happen?

244
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:47,077
-It's hard to believe
this is the same guy who

245
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:48,977
was fighting monsters for us.

246
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:51,444
-Well, he is Mappy's
big brother after all.

247
00:16:51,477 --> 00:16:54,410
-Hey, I wonder if they're
going to show us on TV?

248
00:16:54,444 --> 00:16:55,377
Look.

249
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:56,944
-Well, since Kazuki
came out last,

250
00:16:56,977 --> 00:16:58,877
I'll have to think of
a punishment later.

251
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:02,610
But first, let's get
down to business.

252
00:17:02,644 --> 00:17:03,677
-The beach?

253
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:07,144
Wait a minute, what
are you talking about?

254
00:17:07,177 --> 00:17:07,877
-What do you mean?

255
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:09,210
We talked about it.

256
00:17:09,244 --> 00:17:11,144
The morning of the big battle.

257
00:17:11,177 --> 00:17:13,944
We're all going swimming
at the beach, all of us.

258
00:17:13,977 --> 00:17:16,110
-I didn't think you were
serious when you asked me.

259
00:17:16,144 --> 00:17:18,577
-We're leaving tomorrow
for two days and one night.

260
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:20,677
-But I don't even
own a swimsuit!

261
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:22,010
-What about the one from school?

262
00:17:22,044 --> 00:17:23,077
-Are you insane?

263
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:24,744
No way I'll wear one
of those in public.

264
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:25,610
-But why not?

265
00:17:25,644 --> 00:17:27,044
It would make Daihama happy.

266
00:17:27,077 --> 00:17:28,210
-What are-- Kazuki!

267
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:36,244
It's over.

268
00:17:36,277 --> 00:17:38,744
I'm ruined.

269
00:17:38,777 --> 00:17:40,944
-The spring semester
at Ginsei Academy

270
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:42,877
officially ended this afternoon.

271
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:44,810
The truth behind the
mass fainting incident

272
00:17:44,844 --> 00:17:46,177
still remains a mystery.

273
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:47,944
But a sense of
normalcy is gradually

274
00:17:47,977 --> 00:17:50,144
returning to the school
and the city as well.

275
00:17:50,177 --> 00:17:52,477
-No way they'll really
know what happened--

276
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:55,144
-Because none of us has said
a word about it to anyone.

277
00:17:55,177 --> 00:17:56,644
-Well, actually,
we really didn't

278
00:17:56,677 --> 00:17:58,477
understand what
happened ourselves.

279
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,544
FEMALE SPEAKER (ON TV):
However, similar incidents

280
00:18:00,577 --> 00:18:04,144
continue to occur in
various parts of the world.

281
00:18:04,177 --> 00:18:07,577
I think I'll go
see this new world.

282
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:09,610
-Victor.

283
00:18:09,644 --> 00:18:11,110
-So does this also
have something

284
00:18:11,144 --> 00:18:12,710
to do with the two of you?

285
00:18:12,744 --> 00:18:14,077
-No, it doesn't.

286
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:16,944
-Hm, well, all righty then.

287
00:18:16,977 --> 00:18:19,444
-I'm a bit surprised
you're not asking us

288
00:18:19,477 --> 00:18:21,377
a lot of questions
about what happened.

289
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:24,310
-We'd be happy to listen if you
feel like telling us, Tokiko.

290
00:18:24,344 --> 00:18:26,844
-But the truth is, it's not as
if we could really do anything

291
00:18:26,877 --> 00:18:29,377
about it, even if we did
know what was going on.

292
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:31,310
-The important thing
is everyone was saved,

293
00:18:31,344 --> 00:18:32,577
and we're fine with just that.

294
00:18:36,544 --> 00:18:39,010
-You really do
have good friends.

295
00:18:39,044 --> 00:18:41,077
-What are you talking about?

296
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:43,244
They've become your
friends too, Tokiko.

297
00:18:43,277 --> 00:18:45,077
-Yeah, I guess that's true.

298
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:47,844
But I can't bear
dragging them into this,

299
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:49,977
so I'm going to
keep my distance.

300
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:53,677
To me, my friends are comrades
who will fight alongside me.

301
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:57,977
Right now, that's you
and the Warrior Chief.

302
00:18:58,010 --> 00:18:59,577
-Any word from Bravo?

303
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:02,077
-Not a word since
we last saw him.

304
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:03,777
Does that worry you, Kazuki?

305
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,877
The story about
the black kakugane

306
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:08,144
and you becoming like Victor?

307
00:19:08,177 --> 00:19:09,777
-Here.

308
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:12,644
Deep in my heart, I also
feel that you and Bravo

309
00:19:12,677 --> 00:19:15,244
are my comrades as well, Tokiko.

310
00:19:15,277 --> 00:19:20,144
I can't wait until the three
of us work together again.

311
00:19:20,177 --> 00:19:22,410
But for now, it's
summer vacation,

312
00:19:22,444 --> 00:19:26,077
so let's just take it
easy until Bravo returns.

313
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:26,944
TOKIKO: You're right.

314
00:19:36,644 --> 00:19:37,844
-It's beautiful.

315
00:19:37,877 --> 00:19:39,744
-It's less crowded
than I expected.

316
00:19:39,777 --> 00:19:42,277
-It's because I chose
an unknown spot.

317
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:44,544
-Nothing like the beach.

318
00:19:44,577 --> 00:19:46,444
-Okakura, your jaw's dropping.

319
00:19:46,477 --> 00:19:49,210
-You ain't see
nothing yet, baby.

320
00:19:49,244 --> 00:19:50,644
-Sorry for the wait.

321
00:20:01,944 --> 00:20:02,844
-What is it?

322
00:20:02,877 --> 00:20:04,510
Is there something
wrong with it?

323
00:20:04,544 --> 00:20:07,144
-Oh no, nothing wrong at all.

324
00:20:07,177 --> 00:20:09,277
Uh, your belly
button is showing.

325
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:10,610
-Stop pointing at me.

326
00:20:10,644 --> 00:20:13,610
I had to go to a local store and
this is the only suit they had.

327
00:20:13,644 --> 00:20:15,644
It's not like you've
never seen one before.

328
00:20:15,677 --> 00:20:17,844
-You've seen it before?

329
00:20:17,877 --> 00:20:19,677
-I don't remember.

330
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:21,077
-Stop staring, will you?

331
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:23,010
-Aw, they're in love.

332
00:20:23,044 --> 00:20:25,577
-Actually, they sound
like a couple of kids.

333
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:27,344
-Hey, guys, look over
there in the water.

334
00:20:27,377 --> 00:20:27,944
It's a surfer.

335
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:29,810
A surfer.

336
00:20:29,844 --> 00:20:35,377
-Wait a sec, is
that Captain Bravo?

337
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:36,244
-Yes, that's me.

338
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:38,444
I'm here.

339
00:20:38,477 --> 00:20:39,444
-Hey, everyone.

340
00:20:39,477 --> 00:20:41,210
So how are you all doing today?

341
00:20:41,244 --> 00:20:41,877
-Huh?

342
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:42,910
How did he find us here?

343
00:20:42,944 --> 00:20:44,377
-And what about your job?

344
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,610
-I didn't know you could surf.

345
00:20:46,644 --> 00:20:48,510
-Will you tell us your
real name already?

346
00:20:48,544 --> 00:20:52,510
-Whoa, it's all a secret,
because it's cooler that way.

347
00:20:52,544 --> 00:20:55,144
Sorry I wasn't able to
join you on the way over.

348
00:20:55,177 --> 00:20:58,444
I've got a car so leave
the ride home to me.

349
00:20:58,477 --> 00:20:58,944
-All right.

350
00:20:58,977 --> 00:21:00,010
-Yes.

351
00:21:00,044 --> 00:21:01,777
That means we'll save
half of the fair.

352
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:03,110
-Nice to see you, Bravo.

353
00:21:03,144 --> 00:21:04,877
-Hey there.

354
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:06,144
Good to be back.

355
00:21:06,177 --> 00:21:07,810
-Warrior Chief,
Warrior Chief, what's

356
00:21:07,844 --> 00:21:10,310
the latest with the case?

357
00:21:10,344 --> 00:21:12,244
-Yes, all in good time.

358
00:21:12,277 --> 00:21:14,310
Don't be in such a hurry.

359
00:21:14,344 --> 00:21:16,310
Hey, since we are
at the beach, let's

360
00:21:16,344 --> 00:21:18,377
enjoy the rest of the day.

361
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:19,377
-Yeah!

362
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:20,244
-You kids!

363
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:28,077
Uh.

364
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:37,577
-You don't want to involve
the others now, do you?

365
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:39,710
Why don't we take out time
to talk it over tonight?

366
00:21:54,297 --> 00:21:57,130
[theme music]

367
00:23:25,197 --> 00:23:28,563
TOKIKO: Re-exterminate Kazuki
Muto, that is the new mission

368
00:23:28,597 --> 00:23:32,130
ordered by the Alchemist Army,
but I won't let them do that.

369
00:23:32,163 --> 00:23:34,430
I simply won't allow it.

370
00:23:34,463 --> 00:23:37,397
Next time, "New Strength."

371
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:40,930
I'll splatter your guts.
