and an Alchemist
Warrior, Kazuki Muto

a new life by replacing his
heart with the Kakugane,

expectation, "The Sword."

-That is the last thing
we should worry about!

105

and identify the enemy!

of working at it all night.

-What's that?

113
00:06:37,328 --> 00:06:38,995
-It's an incubator I
found in the basement

114
00:06:39,028 --> 00:06:41,162
for a homunculus embryo.

115

-Embryo?

116
00:06:42,462 --> 00:06:44,962
-Created from cells of
living organisms as the base.

117
00:06:53,762 --> 00:06:58,262
They are very fragile
things, 1.2 inches in size

118
00:06:58,295 --> 00:07:00,428
and they can't last
more than a day--

119
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:03,762
unless they're in an airtight
space like this flask.

120
00:07:03,795 --> 00:07:06,828
However, when that fragile
embryo lodges itself

121
00:07:06,862 --> 00:07:10,195
into a person's brain,
it takes over the flesh,

122
00:07:10,228 --> 00:07:12,695
alters the entire
body, and morphs

123
00:07:12,728 --> 00:07:15,228
into an unyielding
man-eating monster

124
00:07:15,262 --> 00:07:18,095

125

-Mita and Saruwatari were
shadows of their former selves.

127
00:07:22,628 --> 00:07:25,795
An embryo takes over
one body but more will

128
00:07:25,828 --> 00:07:27,562
be sacrificed to feed.

129
00:07:27,595 --> 00:07:29,162
-That means there'll
be more victims.

130

-Yes, that's right.

131
00:07:30,328 --> 00:07:32,395
Someone who knows the
results of his actions

132
00:07:32,428 --> 00:07:35,262
conducted these experiments
here and created these monsters.

133
00:07:38,828 --> 00:07:42,862
And there's only one thing that
can stop them and nothing else,

the same school as you master.

Should we attack?

I'm confident I can take
them out from where we are.

-Not yet.

146

00:09:08,395 --> 00:09:10,795
I thought we'd be able to do
some Kakugane research if we

164
00:09:10,828 --> 00:09:14,062
got close, but I guess
it won't be possible.

165
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:16,495
Washio, now go and attack.

166
00:09:19,828 --> 00:09:22,728
[grunt]

167
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:23,395
-It's up above.

168
00:09:27,028 --> 00:09:31,462
[grunt]

169
00:09:31,495 --> 00:09:32,462
-Buso Renkin!

170
00:09:37,928 --> 00:09:38,895
-He's coming.

171
00:09:38,928 --> 00:09:41,128
Throw your lance into this sky.

172
00:09:41,162 --> 00:09:42,828
With the power of
your Buso Renkin,

173
00:09:42,862 --> 00:09:44,395
it will reach him quicker.

174
00:09:44,428 --> 00:09:45,428
-But how?

175
00:09:45,462 --> 00:09:47,128
-Your Buso Renkin is
a part of yourself

176
00:09:47,162 --> 00:09:49,062
that's coming from
your fighting instinct.

177
00:09:49,095 --> 00:09:50,395
You have the power to do it.

178
00:09:50,428 --> 00:09:51,295
Just believe.

179
00:09:51,328 --> 00:09:53,228
-I got it.

180
00:09:53,262 --> 00:09:55,862
Pierce through, my Buso Renkin!

181
00:10:02,195 --> 00:10:03,128
[gasp]

182
00:10:03,162 --> 00:10:04,095
-Evade the attack.

183
00:10:04,128 --> 00:10:08,462
-I won't let you get away.

184
00:10:08,495 --> 00:10:09,662
-Isn't this a surprise?

185
00:10:09,695 --> 00:10:12,028
An Alchemist Warrior,
how interesting.

186
00:10:12,062 --> 00:10:13,962
[chuckling]

187
00:10:13,995 --> 00:10:17,328
-Valkyrie Skirt!

188
00:10:17,362 --> 00:10:19,262
He's fast.

189
00:10:19,295 --> 00:10:21,062
-Are you all right, Master?

190
00:10:21,095 --> 00:10:22,962
-Yes, I'm fine.

191
00:10:22,995 --> 00:10:26,062
But I shouldn't underestimate
that death scythe girl--

192
00:10:26,095 --> 00:10:29,195
and the other one, the
boy with the lance.

193
00:10:31,995 --> 00:10:33,762
TOKIKO (VOICEOVER):
That school uniform.

194
00:10:33,795 --> 00:10:36,128
This guy is from the
same school as Kazuki.

195
00:10:36,162 --> 00:10:39,328
It's a start.

196
00:10:39,362 --> 00:10:40,228
-Tokiko!

197
00:10:40,262 --> 00:10:42,862
Are you all right?

198
00:10:42,895 --> 00:10:43,728
Tokiko!

199
00:10:43,762 --> 00:10:47,962
[clang]

200
00:10:47,995 --> 00:10:51,695
[shuddering grunts]

201
00:10:51,728 --> 00:10:54,362
-Are you all right, Kazuki?

202
00:10:54,395 --> 00:10:55,095
-Uh huh.

203
00:10:59,462 --> 00:11:02,262
-There were a total of 20
incubators underground.

204
00:11:02,295 --> 00:11:05,295
We defeated 16
homunculi last night.

205
00:11:05,328 --> 00:11:08,162
Add the wretched embryo
I repelled off earlier.

206
00:11:08,195 --> 00:11:10,762
That leaves three homunculi
enemies left and the Papillon

207
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:13,995
Masked Creator, the one who
wears the Papillon mask.

208
00:11:14,028 --> 00:11:15,562
The remaining three
are most likely

209
00:11:15,595 --> 00:11:17,162
there to safeguard the creator.

210
00:11:17,195 --> 00:11:18,562
It's not going to be easy.

211
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:19,662
-I agree.

212
00:11:19,695 --> 00:11:21,262
We definitely gotta win.

213
00:11:21,295 --> 00:11:22,595
-That's right.

214
00:11:22,628 --> 00:11:26,295
The Buso Renkin was specifically
created to exterminate them.

215
00:11:26,328 --> 00:11:27,928
We'll beat them no matter what.

216
00:11:27,962 --> 00:11:29,528
We cannot lose.

217
00:11:29,562 --> 00:11:30,995
-We won't just beat them.

218
00:11:31,028 --> 00:11:33,895
We'll have to prevent any
further victims from dying.

219
00:11:33,928 --> 00:11:37,495
That's the only way we
can obtain true victory.

220
00:11:37,528 --> 00:11:41,662
I'm going to go pay my respects
at the gravesite once more.

221
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:43,795
TOKIKO (VOICEOVER): He makes
the most difficult task

222
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,262
sound so easy.

223
00:11:45,295 --> 00:11:47,428
However--

224
00:11:47,462 --> 00:11:48,728
TOKIKO: Wait.

225
00:11:48,762 --> 00:11:49,695
-Hmm?

226
00:11:49,728 --> 00:11:52,395
TOKIKO: I'll go with you.

227
00:11:52,428 --> 00:11:54,228
-That was really
something up there.

228
00:11:54,262 --> 00:11:57,195
I wonder what in the
world that big thing was?

229
00:11:57,228 --> 00:11:57,995
DAIHAMA: Hmm.

230
00:11:58,028 --> 00:11:59,595
Maybe a plastic bottle rocket.

231
00:11:59,628 --> 00:12:00,795
MAHIRO: Who knows?

232
00:12:00,828 --> 00:12:01,662
-Hah.

233
00:12:01,695 --> 00:12:02,495
All right, come on.

234
00:12:02,528 --> 00:12:03,728
Who cares?

235
00:12:03,762 --> 00:12:06,362
Let's get going, I won't
let him get away with this.

236
00:12:06,395 --> 00:12:08,062
He has to introduce me.

237
00:12:08,095 --> 00:12:08,762
Puh!

238
00:12:08,795 --> 00:12:10,162
MAHIRO: Can it be true?

239
00:12:10,195 --> 00:12:12,962
My big brother really meeting
a woman in a place like that?

240
00:12:12,995 --> 00:12:16,062
OKAKURA: I'll catch him
strawberrying there.

241
00:12:16,095 --> 00:12:17,462
[heartbeat]

242
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:35,759
-Kazuki.

243
00:12:35,792 --> 00:12:37,692
-What is it, Tokiko?

244
00:12:37,726 --> 00:12:39,792
-You've obtained
power, you know.

245
00:12:39,826 --> 00:12:40,992
-Mm-hmm.

246
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:42,992
-But that alone will not
be enough to prevent there

247
00:12:43,026 --> 00:12:45,892
from being more victims.

248
00:12:45,926 --> 00:12:48,359
If your main purpose is to
prevent there being any more

249
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:51,226
victims, then you must
understand how imperative

250
00:12:51,259 --> 00:12:55,459
it is to fully commander
your Buso Renkin.

251
00:12:55,492 --> 00:12:56,359
MAHIRO: Oh!

252
00:12:56,392 --> 00:12:57,692
There he is!

253
00:12:57,726 --> 00:13:01,026
Yoo-hoo, Kazuki!

254
00:13:01,059 --> 00:13:03,226
-Did you tell them we were
going to be coming here?

255
00:13:03,259 --> 00:13:04,759
-No, I didn't.

256
00:13:04,792 --> 00:13:05,892
-Well, that's fine.

257
00:13:05,926 --> 00:13:07,692
You're going to have
to handle this alone.

258
00:13:07,726 --> 00:13:08,892
I'm leaving.

259
00:13:08,926 --> 00:13:10,926
-Why would you want to
come to a place like this?

260
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:12,026
-Ooh, I can't believe it!

261
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:13,959
It's true, you've
got a girlfriend!

262
00:13:13,992 --> 00:13:14,926
-Huh?

263
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,592
-Kazuki!

264
00:13:17,626 --> 00:13:18,926
-Uh, I, I wha--

265
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:19,792
-Congratulations.

266
00:13:19,826 --> 00:13:21,292
-Please tell us the details.

267
00:13:21,326 --> 00:13:22,126
-So since when?

268
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:23,359
Tell me, tell me, I wanna know?

269
00:13:23,392 --> 00:13:24,326
-My girlfriend?

270
00:13:24,359 --> 00:13:24,826
What?

271
00:13:24,859 --> 00:13:25,326
Me?

272
00:13:25,359 --> 00:13:25,959
Her?

273
00:13:25,992 --> 00:13:27,359
I, well, um, uh--

274
00:13:27,392 --> 00:13:28,559
-I see.

275
00:13:28,592 --> 00:13:30,392
So I'm your girlfriend, huh?

276
00:13:30,426 --> 00:13:31,059
Very interesting.

277
00:13:34,459 --> 00:13:35,392
-Uh.

278
00:13:35,426 --> 00:13:39,359
[gasps]

279
00:13:39,392 --> 00:13:42,526
-(IN UNISON) We're
so very sorry.

280
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:46,859
-If you're not his girlfriend,
then who exactly are you?

281
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:48,026
-(IN UNISON) We're siblings.

282
00:13:48,059 --> 00:13:49,326
[gasp]

283
00:13:49,359 --> 00:13:50,292
-A big sister?

284
00:13:50,326 --> 00:13:52,626
Wait a minute, nobody told me.

285
00:13:52,659 --> 00:13:54,092
-Yeah.

286
00:13:54,126 --> 00:13:55,459
-Oh!

287
00:13:55,492 --> 00:13:57,426
But you have a different last
name, don't you, big sister?

288
00:13:57,459 --> 00:13:59,959
-Oh, this is wonderful.

289
00:13:59,992 --> 00:14:02,159
Can you come up with
something better than this?

290
00:14:02,192 --> 00:14:04,626
-Um, the only thing
I can think of

291
00:14:04,659 --> 00:14:07,459
is you being my teacher
or maybe my rival.

292
00:14:07,492 --> 00:14:08,692
[groan]

293
00:14:08,726 --> 00:14:11,659
-Hmm, Kazuki's girlfriend
is his teacher.

294
00:14:11,692 --> 00:14:13,459
MAHIRO (VOICEOVER): So
if she's his sister,

295
00:14:13,492 --> 00:14:14,859
then she has to be mine too.

296
00:14:14,892 --> 00:14:15,892
KAZUKI (VOICEOVER): Yeah!

297
00:14:15,926 --> 00:14:21,259
[laughter]

298
00:14:21,292 --> 00:14:24,459
-Oh, this is all so confusing.

299
00:14:24,492 --> 00:14:27,859
-Oh, you're so
freakin' lucky, Kazuki!

300
00:14:27,892 --> 00:14:29,259
DAIHAMA: Kazuki
and the girlfriend

301
00:14:29,292 --> 00:14:31,292
say they are rivals, but--

302
00:14:31,326 --> 00:14:31,992
-Ah!

303
00:14:32,026 --> 00:14:33,692
So that's it, isn't it?

304
00:14:33,726 --> 00:14:35,659
-I think their
imagination's completely

305
00:14:35,692 --> 00:14:37,292
getting out of control.

306
00:14:37,326 --> 00:14:38,359
[clicking tongue]

307
00:14:38,392 --> 00:14:39,659
-It's all for the best.

308
00:14:39,692 --> 00:14:40,926
[quiet screaming]

309
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:42,659
-Listen guys, why
don't we go somewhere

310
00:14:42,692 --> 00:14:45,626
to have some tea instead
of standing around here?

311
00:14:45,659 --> 00:14:47,059
-(GIGGLING) I second that.

312
00:14:47,092 --> 00:14:49,792
-It appears that we have
quite a bit to talk about,

313
00:14:49,826 --> 00:14:51,892
so what do you say, hmm?

314
00:14:51,926 --> 00:14:52,926
-I can't.

315
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,726
I have to go and--
all right, why not?

316
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:56,592
Let's just go.

317
00:15:00,492 --> 00:15:01,926
-All right, everybody!

318
00:15:01,959 --> 00:15:04,359
Then let's all get moving!

319
00:15:04,392 --> 00:15:06,992
-OK.

320
00:15:07,026 --> 00:15:10,926
[gasp]

321
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:12,192
-Tokiko, look.

322
00:15:12,226 --> 00:15:14,826
-Appears we've run
into some trouble.

323
00:15:14,859 --> 00:15:17,659
I should have destroyed it
instead of just deflecting it.

324
00:15:17,692 --> 00:15:19,059
[sigh]

325
00:15:22,326 --> 00:15:23,492
-Hello, Kawazui.

326
00:15:23,526 --> 00:15:24,392
Are you there?

327

If your little sister or your

to take care of business

would have certainly
finished myself off way

before you would have
even opened your eyes.

421
00:19:34,092 --> 00:19:36,759
At this point, it will probably
take about a week or so

422
00:19:36,792 --> 00:19:40,792
for the embryo to reach
the brain from my body.

423
00:19:40,826 --> 00:19:43,892
Before then, we have to defeat

00:24:30,726 --> 00:24:33,859
thanks to Tokiko, who implanted
a Kakugane as a replacement

489
00:24:33,892 --> 00:24:35,259
for his heart.

490
00:24:35,292 --> 00:24:37,592
And using that Kakugane,
he made the vow

491
00:24:37,626 --> 00:24:40,059
to fight and protect everyone.

492
00:24:40,092 --> 00:24:43,626
So anyway, Kazuki's Buso
Renkin looks like a sword,

493
00:24:43,659 --> 00:24:44,992
but it's really a lance.

494
00:24:45,026 --> 00:24:49,159
How fitting for my
reckless big brother.

495
00:24:49,192 --> 00:24:54,126
Using his lance, he charges
into the enemy with a bang!

496
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,259
But the ornament cloth
attached to the lance

497
00:24:56,292 --> 00:24:58,592
is really what makes
this Buso Renkin special.

498
00:24:58,626 --> 00:25:00,792
The cloth responds
to the bearer's will

499
00:25:00,826 --> 00:25:03,326
to fight and energizes
itself, emanating

500
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:05,292
a beautiful orange color.

501
00:25:05,326 --> 00:25:09,259
Inspired by this luminous
color, Tokiko gave the lance

502
00:25:09,292 --> 00:25:11,192
the name of Sunlight Heart.

503
00:25:11,226 --> 00:25:13,226
Kazuki also came up
with several names,

504
00:25:13,259 --> 00:25:15,992
but I think Sunlight
Heart is a much nicer one.

505
00:25:16,026 --> 00:25:17,892
Don't tell him I said that.

506
00:25:17,926 --> 00:25:20,692
Anyway, even though my
big brother has much

507
00:25:20,726 --> 00:25:23,859
learn from Tokiko, I
know we can count on him.

508
00:25:23,892 --> 00:25:27,092
And that's why he's there
for everyone, no matter who

509
00:25:27,126 --> 00:25:28,192
they are.

510
00:25:28,226 --> 00:25:31,626
Okie dokie, tune in
for our next seminar.

511
00:25:31,659 --> 00:25:35,159
