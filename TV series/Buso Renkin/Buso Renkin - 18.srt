NARRATOR: The supernatural
alloy produced

00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:18,933
by gathering the essence
of alchemy is the kakugane.

3
00:00:18,966 --> 00:00:22,866
This device activates upon a
person's fighting instinct,

4
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,166
manifesting the
possessor's inner power

5
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:30,100
into a tangible form, creating
a weapon like no other.

Its name?

00:00:31,366 --> 00:00:32,166
Buso Renkin.

00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:10,663
NARRATOR: Captain
Bravo's mission

10
00:02:10,696 --> 00:02:13,396
to re-exterminate Kazuki
seemed to have been completed,

11
00:02:13,429 --> 00:02:16,463
but thanks to his
energy-draining powers, Kazuki

12
00:02:16,496 --> 00:02:17,529
managed to survive.

13
00:02:20,463 --> 00:02:24,029
Seeing the depth of
Tokiko's concern for Kazuki,

14
00:02:24,063 --> 00:02:26,396
Gouta decided to
challenge Hiwatari

15
00:02:26,429 --> 00:02:30,496
and the Re-extermination
squad for Tokiko's sake.

16
00:02:30,529 --> 00:02:32,829
Ending with Gouta's
escape, the battle

17
00:02:32,863 --> 00:02:34,963
finished without a
clear winner, and thus

18
00:02:34,996 --> 00:02:38,496
the flight of Tokiko,
Kazuki, and Gouta begins.

19
00:02:52,196 --> 00:02:55,129
-Warrior Chief Sakimori,
the re-extermination

20
00:02:55,163 --> 00:02:57,896
of warrior Kazuki, also
known as Victor Three,

21
00:02:57,929 --> 00:02:59,463
was accepted by you.

22
00:02:59,496 --> 00:03:02,196
And although you had the target
standing right before you,

23
00:03:02,229 --> 00:03:04,663
in the end the mission
resulted in failure.

24
00:03:04,696 --> 00:03:07,563
Currently, Victor
Three is on the run

25
00:03:07,596 --> 00:03:10,196
with two former
alchemist warriors.

26
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:13,396
Why did you fail to
confirm his death?

27
00:03:13,429 --> 00:03:15,363
Once the target was
re-exterminated,

28
00:03:15,396 --> 00:03:18,363
the next priority was the
retrieval of the kakugane.

29
00:03:18,396 --> 00:03:22,563
It is difficult to believe
that you had simply forgotten.

30
00:03:22,596 --> 00:03:24,129
-It has been
reported that you've

31
00:03:24,163 --> 00:03:27,896
developed a close friendship
with the enemy, Victor Three.

32
00:03:27,929 --> 00:03:30,529
-If that is the case, then we
cannot help but think that you

33
00:03:30,563 --> 00:03:32,696
let him escape intentionally.

34
00:03:32,729 --> 00:03:35,096
-Warrior Chief Sakimori,
do you have anything

35
00:03:35,129 --> 00:03:39,263
to say in your defense regarding
this mission's failure?

36
00:03:39,296 --> 00:03:42,796
-Excuse me, If I may speak.

37
00:03:42,829 --> 00:03:44,696
-What is it, Warrior Chitose?

38
00:03:44,729 --> 00:03:46,529
-Well regarding
this mission, sir, I

39
00:03:46,563 --> 00:03:48,063
believe it would
be more practical

40
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:49,529
if you were to
treat it separately

41
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:52,396
from the usual missions,
since the target in question

42
00:03:52,429 --> 00:03:53,929
was a former
alchemist warrior that

43
00:03:53,963 --> 00:03:55,963
began to transform
into a victor.

44
00:03:55,996 --> 00:03:58,729
I wonder whether your assessment
of Warrior Chief Sakimori's

45
00:03:58,763 --> 00:04:01,329
mission against an opponent
with that much power

46
00:04:01,363 --> 00:04:04,429
is truly the most
appropriate conclusion.

47
00:04:04,463 --> 00:04:06,763
I believe the focus should
not be on that outcome,

48
00:04:06,796 --> 00:04:09,229
but rather on the power of
Warrior Chief Sakimori's buso

49
00:04:09,263 --> 00:04:11,496
renkin to suppress
Victor Three's attacks.

50
00:04:11,529 --> 00:04:12,729
-Hmm.

51
00:04:12,763 --> 00:04:14,996
-We are currently
in a dire situation.

52
00:04:15,029 --> 00:04:17,196
It is absolutely
necessary for us

53
00:04:17,229 --> 00:04:18,996
to gather as many
people as possible who

54
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:21,363
can serve as part of
a combative force.

55
00:04:21,396 --> 00:04:21,829
-Hmm.

56
00:04:25,663 --> 00:04:28,563
-May I assume that all concerns
have been brought to the table?

57
00:04:33,363 --> 00:04:38,396
Then, I've decided to let
Chief Sakimori's mission

58
00:04:38,429 --> 00:04:40,463
failure go unpunished.

59
00:04:40,496 --> 00:04:43,596
[disgruntled whispering]

60
00:04:43,629 --> 00:04:44,696
-That's enough.

61
00:04:44,729 --> 00:04:47,829
I, the great Warrior
Chief Shosei Sakaguchi,

62
00:04:47,863 --> 00:04:50,329
have made this decision
based on the discussions

63
00:04:50,363 --> 00:04:51,629
during this Inquiry Commission.

64
00:04:55,896 --> 00:04:59,896
Since there are no objections,
Warrior Chief Sakimori,

65
00:04:59,929 --> 00:05:01,363
you are to return
to your mission

66
00:05:01,396 --> 00:05:03,629
and complete the
re-extermination of Victor

67
00:05:03,663 --> 00:05:05,363
Three.

68
00:05:05,396 --> 00:05:07,329
Is that understood?

69
00:05:07,363 --> 00:05:09,063
-Yes, Great Warrior Chief.

70
00:05:09,096 --> 00:05:10,963
-There's not much time left.

71
00:05:10,996 --> 00:05:14,763
I'm expecting you to quickly
execute the mission before you.

72
00:05:14,796 --> 00:05:19,163
Now, in regards to the impending
battle-- Warrior Chitose,

73
00:05:19,196 --> 00:05:22,529
we need to establish and
prepare the victor search squad.

74
00:05:22,563 --> 00:05:25,596
I assign you to take
full charge of this.

75
00:05:25,629 --> 00:05:26,563
Understood?

76
00:05:26,596 --> 00:05:27,896
-Yes

77
00:05:27,929 --> 00:05:30,829
-With that said, the Inquiry
Commission is now adjourned.

78
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:31,796
That is all.

79
00:05:34,763 --> 00:05:35,896
-Thank goodness that's over.

80
00:05:35,929 --> 00:05:39,429
Or maybe it's too
soon to say that.

81
00:05:39,463 --> 00:05:41,263
This mission appears
to be a difficult one

82
00:05:41,296 --> 00:05:42,996
for you, Sakimori.

83
00:05:43,029 --> 00:05:44,229
-Why do you say that?

84
00:05:44,263 --> 00:05:46,263
-Well, that's because we've
worked on the same team

85
00:05:46,296 --> 00:05:49,729
together before,
don't you remember?

86
00:05:49,763 --> 00:05:51,063
Hmm?

87
00:05:51,096 --> 00:05:53,663
-No matter what the mission
is, I will hold to my beliefs

88
00:05:53,696 --> 00:05:55,396
until the very end.

89
00:05:55,429 --> 00:05:55,929
That's all.

90
00:05:59,329 --> 00:06:05,629
CHITOSE (VOICEOVER): Sakimori

91
00:06:05,663 --> 00:06:06,929
-Mm, what a relief.

92
00:06:10,029 --> 00:06:11,129
-You shouldn't be relaxing.

93
00:06:11,163 --> 00:06:13,196
We are being pursued, you know.

94
00:06:13,229 --> 00:06:15,629
-I know, but it
still feels good.

95
00:06:15,663 --> 00:06:20,863
[sighs]

96
00:06:20,896 --> 00:06:23,096
GOUTA (VOICEOVER):
I'm the underdog?

97
00:06:23,129 --> 00:06:24,129
Damn.

98
00:06:24,163 --> 00:06:25,863
But I can pee
further than you can.

99
00:06:25,896 --> 00:06:27,496
-Stop polluting the stream.

100
00:06:27,529 --> 00:06:29,063
And please do your
business elsewhere,

101
00:06:29,096 --> 00:06:31,829
where I can't see you.

102
00:06:31,863 --> 00:06:34,496
And I thought you two were
starting to get along.

103
00:06:34,529 --> 00:06:36,029
-Well, I think we're
actually getting

104
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:37,129
along better than we were.

105
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:39,229
Don't you think?

106
00:06:39,263 --> 00:06:40,729
-Nothing has changed.

107
00:06:40,763 --> 00:06:44,629
And wash your hands, will you?

108
00:06:44,663 --> 00:06:46,596
Honestly, Gouta.

109
00:06:46,629 --> 00:06:47,729
Really, come on.

110
00:06:47,763 --> 00:06:49,529
Can't you at least try
to get along with him?

111
00:06:49,563 --> 00:06:51,163
-That's entirely
out of the question.

112
00:06:51,196 --> 00:06:53,363
I can't stand that idiot.

113
00:06:53,396 --> 00:06:55,763
One of these days I'm
gonna beat him down

114
00:06:55,796 --> 00:06:57,029
until he begs for mercy.

115
00:06:57,063 --> 00:06:57,529
-Marcy.

116
00:07:01,196 --> 00:07:04,396
Well, I figured if I said
mercy, then it might help.

117
00:07:04,429 --> 00:07:05,696
But it looks like it didn't.

118
00:07:05,729 --> 00:07:07,696
-Actually, I want to
hear you say something

119
00:07:07,729 --> 00:07:09,296
completely different, Tokiko.

120
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:11,063
-Huh?

121
00:07:11,096 --> 00:07:13,529
-All I wanna hear you utter
are three magical words,

122
00:07:13,563 --> 00:07:16,496
and those are kiss me, Gouta.

123
00:07:16,529 --> 00:07:18,963
-I'll be the one making
you beg for mercy!

124
00:07:23,963 --> 00:07:25,529
-Hey, uh, Tokiko.

125
00:07:25,563 --> 00:07:28,296
Where exactly are we
headed for, anyway?

126
00:07:28,329 --> 00:07:31,596
-Newton Apple Academy for Girls
is going to be our destination.

127
00:07:34,596 --> 00:07:39,929
-That's the school where
you got my kakugane from.

128
00:07:39,963 --> 00:07:41,596
-Yes, that's the place.

129
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:44,463
I suppose it's time I tell
you what happened there.

130
00:07:44,496 --> 00:07:46,029
TOKIKO (VOICEOVER):
It was the mission

131
00:07:46,063 --> 00:07:48,763
I was on before I
came to Ginzei city.

132
00:07:48,796 --> 00:07:52,396
After hearing about a miracle
sacred stone that heals wounds,

133
00:07:52,429 --> 00:07:55,029
I decided to sneak into
that school to investigate.

134
00:08:07,729 --> 00:08:10,529
A fake.

135
00:08:10,563 --> 00:08:13,463
The miracle sacred
stone which heals wounds

136
00:08:13,496 --> 00:08:16,096
is said to be somewhere
at this school.

137
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:18,663
I know from investigating it
that the stone is actually

138
00:08:18,696 --> 00:08:19,796
a kakugane.

139
00:08:19,829 --> 00:08:21,996
But where in the
world is the real one?

140
00:08:31,963 --> 00:08:33,763
A basement-- No.

141
00:08:33,796 --> 00:08:35,129
More like an
underground chamber.

142
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:42,363
Found it.

143
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:44,329
This completes my mission.

144
00:08:44,363 --> 00:08:46,296
-Are you an Alchemist Warrior?

145
00:08:55,163 --> 00:08:57,596
Go ahead and take it.

146
00:08:57,629 --> 00:08:59,929
It belongs to you, anyway.

147
00:08:59,963 --> 00:09:01,963
You may use it, if you want.

148
00:09:01,996 --> 00:09:05,396
However, let no harm come to it.

149
00:09:05,429 --> 00:09:09,896
For if you do, a terrible
fate will befall you.

150
00:09:09,929 --> 00:09:11,429
TOKIKO (VOICEOVER):
The next morning,

151
00:09:11,463 --> 00:09:13,696
the Academy was in chaos.

152
00:09:13,729 --> 00:09:16,229
But not because of the
sacred stone's destruction,

153
00:09:16,263 --> 00:09:18,063
but because it was missing.

154
00:09:18,096 --> 00:09:20,496
The imitation I broke
and the floor I destroyed

155
00:09:20,529 --> 00:09:24,529
had been restored, leaving
no trace of what I'd done.

156
00:09:24,563 --> 00:09:27,029
The underground chamber
had disappeared as well.

157
00:09:27,063 --> 00:09:29,829
The next day, the Alchemist
Army came to investigate,

158
00:09:29,863 --> 00:09:33,429
but no evidence to support
my claim was found.

159
00:09:33,463 --> 00:09:36,063
In the end, the
case was suspended.

160
00:09:36,096 --> 00:09:38,229
But now I have no
doubt-- that man

161
00:09:38,263 --> 00:09:40,796
knows something regarding
Kazuki's black kakugane.

162
00:09:40,829 --> 00:09:42,163
I'm sure of it.

163
00:09:42,196 --> 00:09:44,029
-We should head straight to
the Academy as soon as we can.

164
00:09:44,063 --> 00:09:46,329
-And find the man that was
in the underground chamber.

165
00:09:49,129 --> 00:09:51,429
-Hey, Papi, where are
we heading to, anyway?

166
00:09:51,463 --> 00:09:53,429
We'll never find
Kazuki and the others

167
00:09:53,463 --> 00:09:56,029
if we just keep searching
randomly like this.

168
00:09:56,063 --> 00:09:58,396
-You might be right about
that, but I can't just

169
00:09:58,429 --> 00:10:00,063
sit around and do nothing.

170
00:10:00,096 --> 00:10:02,996
You see the lifestyle
of a beautiful butterfly

171
00:10:03,029 --> 00:10:04,063
is to dance in the sky.

172
00:10:04,096 --> 00:10:05,429
-Oh, come on, give me a break.

173
00:10:05,463 --> 00:10:08,696
I just wanna know where Kazuki
and the others are hiding.

174
00:10:08,729 --> 00:10:11,829
-It is your master's job to find
that information out for us,

175
00:10:11,863 --> 00:10:12,396
isn't it?

176
00:10:15,629 --> 00:10:17,229
Any luck finding
out the whereabouts

177
00:10:17,263 --> 00:10:19,129
of Mucho and the others?

178
00:10:19,163 --> 00:10:21,096
-No, it seems like
Tokiko is successfully

179
00:10:21,129 --> 00:10:23,296
out-witting the Army.

180
00:10:23,329 --> 00:10:25,829
Apparently, the Alchemist
Army has not yet located them,

181
00:10:25,863 --> 00:10:26,863
either.

182
00:10:26,896 --> 00:10:28,429
-Then find out where
they're headed.

183
00:10:28,463 --> 00:10:30,729
If that girl is with
them, it's hard to believe

184
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:33,163
that they are just running away.

185
00:10:33,196 --> 00:10:36,329
They must be headed
toward a specific place.

186
00:10:36,363 --> 00:10:37,163
-That hurts!

187
00:10:37,196 --> 00:10:38,796
It's gonna break, break, break!

188
00:10:38,829 --> 00:10:41,763
Ah, it broke!

189
00:10:41,796 --> 00:10:43,763
-You're right, that
does make sense.

190
00:10:43,796 --> 00:10:46,029
In that case, I'll
continue my search.

191
00:10:46,063 --> 00:10:50,363
-Oh, by the way, I have
one more thing to ask you.

192
00:10:50,396 --> 00:10:52,829
Where is the pursuit
team right now?

193
00:10:59,963 --> 00:11:02,996
-Pretty impressive how they
can elude us like this,

194
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:05,029
considering they're just kids.

195
00:11:05,063 --> 00:11:07,629
Well, as you know, they
were one of our own,

196
00:11:07,663 --> 00:11:10,363
so it's natural that
they have some skills.

197
00:11:10,396 --> 00:11:13,129
-So right now it's all
about outsmarting them.

198
00:11:13,163 --> 00:11:15,796
I can't stand the little
bastards playing around with us

199
00:11:15,829 --> 00:11:16,596
anymore.

200
00:11:16,629 --> 00:11:19,429
[beeping]

201
00:11:19,463 --> 00:11:20,296
-This is Chitose.

202
00:11:20,329 --> 00:11:21,563
Can you hear me?

203
00:11:21,596 --> 00:11:23,163
-Yeah, what's
happening, Chitose?

204
00:11:23,196 --> 00:11:24,929
Have you located
them for us yet?

205
00:11:24,963 --> 00:11:26,196
-No, not yet.

206
00:11:26,229 --> 00:11:27,996
But something else has caught
my attention right now.

207
00:11:28,029 --> 00:11:29,629
-Caught your attention?

208
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:32,563
-As I was looking through
some records and documents,

209
00:11:32,596 --> 00:11:35,396
I noticed something suspicious
in the report regarding

210
00:11:35,429 --> 00:11:38,596
the black kakugane which
produced Victor Three.

211
00:11:38,629 --> 00:11:40,363
The person who
originally retrieved it

212
00:11:40,396 --> 00:11:42,529
was Warrior Tokiko,
who is currently

213
00:11:42,563 --> 00:11:44,396
on the run with Victor Three.

214
00:11:44,429 --> 00:11:47,963
Their goal is to prevent the
transformation of Victor Three.

215
00:11:47,996 --> 00:11:51,629
If I consider all of these
factors into my investigation--

216
00:11:51,663 --> 00:11:53,763
-Then we got them.

217
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:54,963
And that place is?

218
00:11:54,996 --> 00:11:57,563
-Newton Apple Academy for Girls.

219
00:11:57,596 --> 00:11:59,263
-Let's get moving.

220
00:11:59,296 --> 00:12:01,029
-You know, it's kind
of amusing to me

221
00:12:01,063 --> 00:12:04,429
how those kids are still hanging
onto a hopeless situation.

222
00:12:04,463 --> 00:12:05,996
-They might be
kids, but it seems

223
00:12:06,029 --> 00:12:07,896
like we shouldn't
underestimate them.

224
00:12:07,929 --> 00:12:09,929
-Cut the chit chat
and hurry up, will ya?

225
00:12:09,963 --> 00:12:11,296
We've got to get them, quick.

226
00:12:15,163 --> 00:12:16,596
What is it?

227
00:12:16,629 --> 00:12:19,196
-Seems like we have
ourselves a guest.

228
00:12:19,229 --> 00:12:21,029
-It looks like a homunculus.

229
00:12:21,063 --> 00:12:22,029
Do

230
00:12:22,063 --> 00:12:23,896
-I've found you.

231
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:38,435
-Slow down, Tokiko, will ya?

232
00:12:38,469 --> 00:12:40,102
You're walking too fast.

233
00:12:40,135 --> 00:12:42,502
-Well you know, unlike
you, Tokiko and I

234
00:12:42,535 --> 00:12:44,769
did go through the grueling
training with the Alchemist

235
00:12:44,802 --> 00:12:48,335
Army, so this mountain
hiking is nothing for us.

236
00:12:48,369 --> 00:12:50,435
-I wonder if she gets
tired at that pace.

237
00:12:50,469 --> 00:12:52,302
-You don't have to
worry about it, right?

238
00:12:52,335 --> 00:12:54,002
If you get tired, then
all you have to do

239
00:12:54,035 --> 00:12:57,902
is drain energy from
others around you.

240
00:12:57,935 --> 00:13:01,569
-I don't find that funny at all.

241
00:13:01,602 --> 00:13:03,635
-Well tell me this.

242
00:13:03,669 --> 00:13:06,335
If we successfully prevent
the transformation--

243
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:08,002
-What do you mean, if?

244
00:13:08,035 --> 00:13:10,035
-Well, if you are
successful, will you

245
00:13:10,069 --> 00:13:12,502
go back to being a warrior
for the Alchemist Army?

246
00:13:12,535 --> 00:13:14,469
Do you really think
you'll be able to fight

247
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:17,235
alongside the people that
tried to kill you once?

248
00:13:17,269 --> 00:13:19,602
-Well, at least I'll be
fighting alongside people

249
00:13:19,635 --> 00:13:23,569
I share the same values with.

250
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:25,735
And if we all want to
protect the same thing,

251
00:13:25,769 --> 00:13:27,269
I'm sure we all can be allies.

252
00:13:34,569 --> 00:13:35,769
-Well, well, well.

253
00:13:35,802 --> 00:13:37,269
What a pleasant surprise.

254
00:13:37,302 --> 00:13:39,269
Such an elegant homunculus.

255
00:13:39,302 --> 00:13:42,102
-Oh, how nice to know there
are Alchemist Warriors that

256
00:13:42,135 --> 00:13:44,369
have a sense of what's fabulous.

257
00:13:44,402 --> 00:13:48,069
-It is rare to meet a homunculus
who actually has the courage

258
00:13:48,102 --> 00:13:50,302
to face us.

259
00:13:50,335 --> 00:13:51,735
-What do you want?

260
00:13:51,769 --> 00:13:55,169
We've got some more important
things to deal with right now.

261
00:13:55,202 --> 00:13:56,535
-What a coincidence.

262
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:59,902
We've got some important
things to deal with as well.

263
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:04,202
That is why I'll just get
directly to the point.

264
00:14:04,235 --> 00:14:06,969
Where is Kazuki Muto?

265
00:14:07,002 --> 00:14:08,035
-Muto?

266
00:14:08,069 --> 00:14:10,135
Are you referring
to Victor Three?

267
00:14:10,169 --> 00:14:12,469
-What, do you know
that stupid punk?

268
00:14:12,502 --> 00:14:14,135
-Well, in that
case, we can't let

269
00:14:14,169 --> 00:14:16,435
him get away that
easy, now can we?

270
00:14:16,469 --> 00:14:17,635
Just leave this one to me.

271
00:14:17,669 --> 00:14:19,169
I'll take care of it myself.

272
00:14:19,202 --> 00:14:22,102
-All right, then we're just
going to keep on moving ahead.

273
00:14:22,135 --> 00:14:23,835
-No worries, I'll catch up soon.

274
00:14:27,169 --> 00:14:28,602
-You think he'll be all right?

275
00:14:28,635 --> 00:14:29,802
-He'll be fine.

276
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:32,535
After all, he has
beaten more homunculi

277
00:14:32,569 --> 00:14:34,502
than even Sakimori and me.

278
00:14:34,535 --> 00:14:37,935
In fact, he's the current record
holder of the Alchemist Army.

279
00:14:44,602 --> 00:14:46,969
-All right, homunculus.

280
00:14:47,002 --> 00:14:49,202
If you actually win
against me, then I'll

281
00:14:49,235 --> 00:14:52,735
tell you where they're headed.

282
00:14:52,769 --> 00:14:55,669
-You better not forget
what you just said to me.

283
00:14:55,702 --> 00:14:58,102
-Remember, that's only
if you can beat me.

284
00:15:02,169 --> 00:15:02,669
-[inaudible].

285
00:15:14,702 --> 00:15:17,602
-I suppose you have some
idea as to why you have all

286
00:15:17,635 --> 00:15:20,235
been summoned here today.

287
00:15:20,269 --> 00:15:22,069
-I guess the time
is finally come.

288
00:15:22,102 --> 00:15:24,035
COMPUTER: For the final
destruction of Victor.

289
00:15:24,069 --> 00:15:28,069
-It's actually more of a
reconnaissance mission.

290
00:15:28,102 --> 00:15:31,335
Our mission is to search
for Victor's location.

291
00:15:31,369 --> 00:15:34,135
We must find Victor,
and prepare ourselves

292
00:15:34,169 --> 00:15:36,069
for the forthcoming battle.

293
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:38,602
-Oh that's no fun,
Warrior Chitose.

294
00:15:38,635 --> 00:15:41,569
What if we just go ahead and
kill him when we find him?

295
00:15:41,602 --> 00:15:43,802
-No order to kill
has been issued.

296
00:15:43,835 --> 00:15:46,169
There is no need for
you to go that far.

297
00:15:46,202 --> 00:15:48,535
-Well in that case, it
should be pretty simple.

298
00:15:48,569 --> 00:15:49,502
Let's get going.

299
00:15:49,535 --> 00:15:51,035
-Time to show off my skills.

300
00:15:51,069 --> 00:15:52,635
-No, not just yet.

301
00:15:52,669 --> 00:15:54,369
There will be one
more member who

302
00:15:54,402 --> 00:15:55,569
will be joining the mission.

303
00:16:05,502 --> 00:16:06,469
[sneers]

304
00:16:06,502 --> 00:16:07,569
-Be careful.

305
00:16:07,602 --> 00:16:10,535
That man in front of
you is Warrior Ikusabe.

306
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:13,235
Among all of the current
warriors in the Alchemist Army,

307
00:16:13,269 --> 00:16:15,802
he holds the record for
killing the most homunculi.

308
00:16:15,835 --> 00:16:17,302
-You don't have to tell me.

309
00:16:17,335 --> 00:16:20,469
I could tell just by
his fighting skills.

310
00:16:20,502 --> 00:16:23,869
However, it's not like I've been
fighting seriously up 'til now,

311
00:16:23,902 --> 00:16:24,702
anyway.

312
00:16:24,735 --> 00:16:25,935
-Excellent.

313
00:16:25,969 --> 00:16:27,669
Then I guess that means
we're both just warming up,

314
00:16:27,702 --> 00:16:29,369
doesn't it?

315
00:16:29,402 --> 00:16:33,102
Since that's the case, then
it's time for us to get serious.

316
00:16:33,135 --> 00:16:34,602
-Don't get too careless, Papi!

317
00:16:34,635 --> 00:16:36,669
Your opponent is an
Alchemist Warrior.

318
00:16:36,702 --> 00:16:39,102
It's hard to tell
what power he has!

319
00:16:39,135 --> 00:16:41,169
-I'm already well aware of that.

320
00:16:41,202 --> 00:16:44,269
However, that doesn't
worry me in the least.

321
00:16:44,302 --> 00:16:45,269
-Hmm?

322
00:16:45,302 --> 00:16:47,502
-Whatever it is he
has, it will be--

323
00:16:47,535 --> 00:16:47,969
-Huh?

324
00:16:50,835 --> 00:16:52,835
-Blown away with
near-death happiness.

325
00:16:55,902 --> 00:16:58,402
-Well, that's a pretty
interesting skill

326
00:16:58,435 --> 00:17:00,169
you've got there, homunculus.

327
00:17:00,202 --> 00:17:02,435
It seems apparent that
you're no small fry.

328
00:17:02,469 --> 00:17:03,402
But I--

329
00:17:07,835 --> 00:17:09,269
-Hey, what the hell is that?

330
00:17:09,302 --> 00:17:11,735
It just began itself right away!

331
00:17:11,769 --> 00:17:13,735
-Rapid regeneration.

332
00:17:13,769 --> 00:17:17,402
-So that's the feature
of your cross spear.

333
00:17:17,435 --> 00:17:19,469
-You won't be able
to stop my spear

334
00:17:19,502 --> 00:17:21,669
Gekisen with that
simple of an attack.

335
00:17:21,702 --> 00:17:22,669
-Then how about this?

336
00:17:25,635 --> 00:17:27,102
-The entire arm.

337
00:17:27,135 --> 00:17:28,569
-He's all gone!

338
00:17:28,602 --> 00:17:30,002
-Not yet.

339
00:17:30,035 --> 00:17:30,502
-What?

340
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:45,635
-That's payback.

341
00:17:45,669 --> 00:17:48,502
Your whole body can
be restored, huh?

342
00:17:48,535 --> 00:17:50,669
In that case, let's try it this.

343
00:17:53,535 --> 00:17:56,435
-No, what are you doing?

344
00:17:56,469 --> 00:17:57,535
-Oh, dear.

345
00:17:57,569 --> 00:18:01,369
Looks like I forgot to
control my strength.

346
00:18:01,402 --> 00:18:03,869
That was certainly an
oversight, now wasn't it?

347
00:18:03,902 --> 00:18:07,235
I was planning to gather
information on Muto.

348
00:18:07,269 --> 00:18:08,635
-This is pretty bad.

349
00:18:08,669 --> 00:18:10,869
There's nothing left of him.

350
00:18:10,902 --> 00:18:13,702
-Oh, don't tell me--

351
00:18:19,469 --> 00:18:20,835
-Oh, yeah.

352
00:18:20,869 --> 00:18:23,835
I haven't done a full-body
restoration in a while.

353
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:26,835
But this is the kind of
stuff that keeps things fun.

354
00:18:26,869 --> 00:18:29,935
-Huh, wasn't expecting
him to have more vitality

355
00:18:29,969 --> 00:18:31,335
than a homunculus.

356
00:18:31,369 --> 00:18:32,602
Who would've thought?

357
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:40,369
-I found him.

358
00:18:52,669 --> 00:18:54,002
-Who are you?

359
00:18:54,035 --> 00:18:56,635
-I am Warrior Chitose,
of the Alchemist Army.

360
00:18:59,269 --> 00:19:01,202
I have recently been
assigned to take

361
00:19:01,235 --> 00:19:03,602
charge of the
Victor search squad.

362
00:19:03,635 --> 00:19:07,835
Shusui Hayasaka, I'm here
to request your assistance.

363
00:19:07,869 --> 00:19:08,835
Please join our mission.

364
00:19:16,369 --> 00:19:17,269
-Hurry up, you two.

365
00:19:17,302 --> 00:19:19,602
This is no time to be sluggish.

366
00:19:19,635 --> 00:19:20,469
-She's right.

367
00:19:20,502 --> 00:19:21,769
Let's go, Gouta.

368
00:19:21,802 --> 00:19:24,269
-I told you, don't talk to
me like I'm your friend, OK?

369
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:30,135
-This is--

370
00:19:34,635 --> 00:19:37,102
-A cemetery.

371
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:40,502
Looks like you've chosen
the perfect battle field.

372
00:19:40,535 --> 00:19:41,469
-You're--

373
00:19:41,502 --> 00:19:45,535
-Warrior Chief Hiwatari.

374
00:19:45,569 --> 00:19:48,269
-A place well-suited for
a monster's last moment.

375
00:19:48,302 --> 00:19:49,869
At least it won't
matter if everything

376
00:19:49,902 --> 00:19:52,069
gets blown to pieces
if we fight here.

377
00:19:52,102 --> 00:19:54,635
-It's about time
we ended the chase.

378
00:19:54,669 --> 00:19:59,002
Besides, our skills are not
in chasing, but in fighting.

379
00:19:59,035 --> 00:20:00,169
TOKIKO (VOICEOVER): Damn it.

380
00:20:00,202 --> 00:20:01,635
We're surrounded.

381
00:20:01,669 --> 00:20:04,835
-Victor Three, also
known as Kazuki Muto,

382
00:20:04,869 --> 00:20:06,635
in the name of the
Alchemist Army,

383
00:20:06,669 --> 00:20:09,435
we are going to
re-exterminate you.

384
00:20:09,469 --> 00:20:10,802
Are you ready?

385
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:13,069
Hey you, droopy eyes?

386
00:20:13,102 --> 00:20:15,869
I still have to settle
things with you as well.

387
00:20:15,902 --> 00:20:17,869
You left in a rush last time.

388
00:20:17,902 --> 00:20:20,835
-I thought I finished
you off already.

389
00:20:20,869 --> 00:20:22,269
Tokiko, what should we do?

390
00:20:22,302 --> 00:20:23,602
-Isn't it obvious to you?

391
00:20:23,635 --> 00:20:24,302
We'll fight.

392
00:20:24,335 --> 00:20:27,502
-Please get out of our way.

393
00:20:27,535 --> 00:20:30,435
Unless I move forward,
my life and the lives

394
00:20:30,469 --> 00:20:33,802
of the ones I care
for will be over.

395
00:20:33,835 --> 00:20:34,902
So let us pass.

396
00:20:38,302 --> 00:20:40,169
I won't cause trouble
for the Alchemist Army,

397
00:20:40,202 --> 00:20:42,469
or jeopardize the
general population.

398
00:20:42,502 --> 00:20:46,002
Before I become a monster for
good, I will finish myself off.

399
00:20:46,035 --> 00:20:48,402
So please, just
move out of our way.

400
00:20:48,435 --> 00:20:49,535
-There's no way in hell.

401
00:21:05,169 --> 00:21:06,835
-It's no use, Papi.

402
00:21:06,869 --> 00:21:08,302
He keeps on restoring himself.

403
00:21:08,335 --> 00:21:10,235
This guy is going
against the rules.

404
00:21:15,435 --> 00:21:16,802
-Looks like you're
having trouble

405
00:21:16,835 --> 00:21:18,535
forming your buso renkin.

406
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:21,635
Your stamina and mental strength
appear to be running out.

407
00:21:25,469 --> 00:21:27,669
You were pretty strong.

408
00:21:27,702 --> 00:21:31,135
Among the 332 that I
have defeated so far,

409
00:21:31,169 --> 00:21:33,902
you are in the top tier.

410
00:21:33,935 --> 00:21:37,369
But now I'm going to
finish you off, homunculus.

411
00:21:37,402 --> 00:21:38,202
Don't resist.

412
00:21:38,235 --> 00:21:39,869
You'll only embarrass yourself.

413
00:21:39,902 --> 00:21:42,202
-What are you talking to
yourself like that for?

414
00:21:42,235 --> 00:21:44,235
I have only begun to
finally figure out

415
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:45,969
the weakness in
that spear of yours.

416
00:21:46,002 --> 00:21:48,769
-Your inability to admit
defeat only degrades you!

417
00:22:21,769 --> 00:22:23,427
[theme music]

418
00:22:23,427 --> 00:23:52,476
[theme music]

419
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,906
-Roaring flames block my sight.

420
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,940
Even if my body
shall burn, I will

421
00:23:58,973 --> 00:24:00,840
protect you no matter what.

422
00:24:00,873 --> 00:24:04,040
As long as you are fine, I
don't care what happens to me.

423
00:24:04,073 --> 00:24:07,573
Next, as long as I can protect
you, I'll splatter your guts.
