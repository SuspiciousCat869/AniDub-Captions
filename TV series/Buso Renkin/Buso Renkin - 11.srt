NARRATOR: The supernatural
alloy produced

2
00:00:14,533 --> 00:00:18,900
by gathering the essence
of alchemy is the Kakugane.

3
00:00:18,933 --> 00:00:22,833
This device activates upon a
person's fighting instinct,

4
00:00:22,866 --> 00:00:25,066
manifesting the
possessor's inner power

5
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:30,366
into a tangible form, creating
a weapon like no other.

00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,133
Its name, Buso Renkin.

[theme music]

8
00:02:08,342 --> 00:02:11,075
-Do you swear to live
together for all eternity?

9
00:02:11,108 --> 00:02:11,642
-Yes!

10
00:02:11,675 --> 00:02:14,008
Yes mommy, I do!

11
00:02:14,042 --> 00:02:16,775
-How about you, Shu?

12
00:02:16,808 --> 00:02:19,542
-Yes, I do.

13
00:02:19,575 --> 00:02:20,808
-All right, then!

14
00:02:20,842 --> 00:02:22,342
Mommy's going to sweat too!

15
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:25,742
Not just the two of you,
but the three of us.

16
00:02:25,775 --> 00:02:27,108
SHUSUI: The
childhood game that I

17
00:02:27,142 --> 00:02:31,042
remember the most is the wedding
game that my sister loved

18
00:02:31,075 --> 00:02:33,975
so much.

19
00:02:34,008 --> 00:02:34,742
WOMAN: OK, kids.

20
00:02:34,775 --> 00:02:37,175
It's time to go to bed now.

21
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:37,875
OUKA: Why, Mommy?

22
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:40,308
I wanna play it again!

23
00:02:40,342 --> 00:02:43,208
SHUSUI: It always ended with
the three of us together.

24
00:02:43,242 --> 00:02:43,975
WOMAN: Yes, honey.

25
00:02:44,008 --> 00:02:46,642
We will.

26
00:02:46,675 --> 00:02:48,308
We'll do it when we
wake up tomorrow.

27
00:02:51,942 --> 00:02:53,342
SHUSUI: I didn't
really understand

28
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:56,675
the meaning of the pledge,
but my mom and my sister

29
00:02:56,708 --> 00:03:02,042
seemed happy, so I
was happy as well.

30
00:03:02,075 --> 00:03:07,775
And I really didn't understand
'til death do us part either.

31
00:03:07,808 --> 00:03:11,042
That's why I had no idea
what happened to my mom

32
00:03:11,075 --> 00:03:13,975
that morning.

33
00:03:14,008 --> 00:03:15,075
We didn't have a dad.

34
00:03:15,108 --> 00:03:17,075
We didn't know why.

35
00:03:17,108 --> 00:03:19,542
I didn't understand.

36
00:03:19,575 --> 00:03:24,308
My sister, my mom,
and I. Our world

37
00:03:24,342 --> 00:03:27,042
consisted of the three of us
in a one bedroom apartment.

38
00:03:30,075 --> 00:03:32,775
-It's dangerous outside,
so don't go out.

39
00:03:32,808 --> 00:03:35,142
-OK!

40
00:03:35,175 --> 00:03:37,642
SHUSUI: Mom always
left for work early

41
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:39,708
and came back late at night.

42
00:03:39,742 --> 00:03:42,108
We listened to what
Mom said and never left

43
00:03:42,142 --> 00:03:44,008
the room in her absence.

44
00:03:44,042 --> 00:03:47,875
Not once did we ever take
a single step outside.

45
00:03:47,908 --> 00:03:50,308
As time went by,
we began to grow

46
00:03:50,342 --> 00:03:53,175
like we were in
some kind of race.

47
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:56,408
But for some reason, Mom
became smaller and thinner.

48
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:04,808
And then, one morning, Mom
stopped moving altogether.

49
00:04:04,842 --> 00:04:05,642
-Mommy, wake up!

50
00:04:05,675 --> 00:04:06,875
It's morning!

51
00:04:06,908 --> 00:04:07,708
Come on.

52
00:04:07,742 --> 00:04:10,308
Wake up, Mommy!

53
00:04:10,342 --> 00:04:11,842
SHUSUI: We waited.

54
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:15,808
And even though we waited for a
long time, Mom didn't wake up.

55
00:04:20,742 --> 00:04:25,342
We grew impatient, so we went
against our mother's words,

56
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:29,942
and eventually, we
decided to go outside.

57
00:04:29,975 --> 00:04:31,208
-Come on, Ouka.

58
00:04:31,242 --> 00:04:32,208
Let's go outside.

59
00:04:32,242 --> 00:04:34,375
-But Mommy said
outside is dangerous.

60
00:04:41,308 --> 00:04:42,108
SHUSUI: However--

61
00:04:42,142 --> 00:04:43,308
[gasping]

62
00:04:46,475 --> 00:04:47,775
SHUSUI AND OUKA: Open the door!

63
00:04:47,808 --> 00:04:48,775
Open, please!

64
00:04:48,808 --> 00:04:50,242
Open the door!

65
00:04:50,275 --> 00:04:51,242
Help!

66
00:04:51,275 --> 00:04:51,742
Help!

67
00:04:51,775 --> 00:04:52,242
Open!

68
00:04:52,275 --> 00:04:52,808
Open up!

69
00:04:52,842 --> 00:04:53,742
Open the door!

70
00:04:53,775 --> 00:04:54,742
Open the door!

71
00:04:54,775 --> 00:04:56,242
SHUSUI: We cried out for help.

72
00:04:56,275 --> 00:05:00,708
We yelled at the top of our lung
so that someone could hear us.

73
00:05:00,742 --> 00:05:02,408
-That apartment is so loud!

74
00:05:02,442 --> 00:05:03,875
It is kind of
disturbing, isn't it?

75
00:05:03,908 --> 00:05:05,942
-I think we should just
mind out own business

76
00:05:05,975 --> 00:05:07,008
and not get involved.

77
00:05:07,042 --> 00:05:08,575
-Shut up, you little brats.

78
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:11,542
Be quiet in there, will you?

79
00:05:11,575 --> 00:05:15,108
SHUSUI: But no one heard us.

80
00:05:15,142 --> 00:05:15,942
No.

81
00:05:15,975 --> 00:05:18,275
It wasn't that no one heard us.

82
00:05:18,308 --> 00:05:19,842
It was that no one
wanted to listen.

83
00:05:23,642 --> 00:05:27,108
We lost track of time.

84
00:05:27,142 --> 00:05:30,708
Then one day, without
any kind of warning,

85
00:05:30,742 --> 00:05:33,608
we were taken under
police custody.

86
00:05:33,642 --> 00:05:36,542
-No, I really didn't
notice anything at all.

87
00:05:36,575 --> 00:05:38,308
-Since it was always
so quiet, I had

88
00:05:38,342 --> 00:05:39,842
no idea there were kids inside.

89
00:05:43,442 --> 00:05:45,308
SHUSUI: It turned
out, the woman we

90
00:05:45,342 --> 00:05:48,042
thought was our mother
had kidnapped us

91
00:05:48,075 --> 00:05:51,175
from our real parents
after an emotional affair,

92
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:53,875
kept us locked
up, and raised us.

93
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:02,875
Our real parents
refused to take us in.

94
00:06:02,908 --> 00:06:04,808
There was no other
place for us to go.

95
00:06:12,775 --> 00:06:15,408
We snuck out of the
hospital in order

96
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:18,075
to make sure that we
wouldn't get separated.

97
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:25,375
So, um, where do
you want to go now?

98
00:06:25,408 --> 00:06:27,842
-Anywhere is fine, but
you have to promise

99
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:29,308
to stay with me, Shusui.

100
00:06:29,342 --> 00:06:30,642
Kay?

101
00:06:30,675 --> 00:06:31,475
-Ouka.

102
00:06:31,508 --> 00:06:36,642
-We'll be together forever, K?

103
00:06:36,675 --> 00:06:38,608
'Til death do us part.

104
00:06:42,142 --> 00:06:43,375
-Give me your money!

105
00:06:43,408 --> 00:06:44,208
And all your food!

106
00:06:44,242 --> 00:06:45,475
Hand over some medication, now!

107
00:06:48,442 --> 00:06:50,008
-Well, well, well!

108
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:53,775
What a cute little mugger!

109
00:06:53,808 --> 00:06:54,508
DR. BUTTERFLY: Ah.

110
00:06:54,542 --> 00:06:55,775
Those eyes.

111
00:06:55,808 --> 00:06:58,175
They're starting
to muddle nicely.

112
00:06:58,208 --> 00:06:58,842
-You see?

113
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:00,242
What did I tell you?

114
00:07:00,275 --> 00:07:03,608
Something good always happens
during a walk in the moonlight.

115
00:07:03,642 --> 00:07:06,675
This little one is
definitely a good catch.

116
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:08,175
-Come along, boy.

117
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:09,975
From what I can
tell, you probably

118
00:07:10,008 --> 00:07:11,308
don't have a place to go anyway.

119
00:07:11,342 --> 00:07:12,542
-No, I won't!

120
00:07:12,575 --> 00:07:14,508
Not without my sister!

121
00:07:14,542 --> 00:07:16,242
I won't go anywhere without her!

122
00:07:16,275 --> 00:07:18,008
-A sister, you say?

123
00:07:18,042 --> 00:07:18,808
I don't mind.

124
00:07:18,842 --> 00:07:20,142
Bring her along.

125
00:07:20,175 --> 00:07:24,075
However, if she doesn't
have eyes like yours,

126
00:07:24,108 --> 00:07:26,075
it's going to be hard
for her to survive.

127
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:33,908
-At some point, the LXE
adopted dozens of kids

128
00:07:33,942 --> 00:07:36,908
to serve as Familiars,
but only a handful

129
00:07:36,942 --> 00:07:39,275
were able to
survive to this day.

130
00:07:39,308 --> 00:07:41,975
All the rest failed
and were devoured.

131
00:07:42,008 --> 00:07:44,942
We're part of that
lucky few that survived.

132
00:07:44,975 --> 00:07:46,775
-Shusui, Ouka.

133
00:07:46,808 --> 00:07:49,775
I don't know what to say.

134
00:07:49,808 --> 00:07:51,008
-We don't want revenge.

135
00:07:51,042 --> 00:07:53,242
We don't blame
anyone for anything.

136
00:07:53,275 --> 00:07:56,875
And our aim isn't to destroy
or rule the world in any way,

137
00:07:56,908 --> 00:07:58,008
either.

138
00:07:58,042 --> 00:08:00,308
Actually, this world
has no meaning to us.

139
00:08:00,342 --> 00:08:04,408
We just really
don't care for it.

140
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:07,308
This entire time, we
had just one wish.

141
00:08:07,342 --> 00:08:09,275
To become Homunculi.

142
00:08:09,308 --> 00:08:12,075
We want a life where even
death can't separate us.

143
00:08:12,108 --> 00:08:15,542
So we can live forever
in a world of our own.

144
00:08:15,575 --> 00:08:18,508
-Is that all you have to say?

145
00:08:18,542 --> 00:08:22,342
The two of you may think
you've had a hard life.

146
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:24,542
That's unfortunate for you.

147
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:28,042
But a Homunculus eats humans,
and I can't allow you two

148
00:08:28,075 --> 00:08:31,608
to become Homunculi and inflict
pain and suffering on others.

149
00:08:31,642 --> 00:08:33,675
So why don't you two
be together in death?

150
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:35,108
-No, Tokiko, wait!

151
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:38,442
-Kazuki.

152
00:08:38,475 --> 00:08:39,342
What are you doing?

153
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:40,108
-Me?

154
00:08:40,142 --> 00:08:41,342
Look at yourself, Tokiko.

155
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:42,542
How can you do this?

156
00:08:42,575 --> 00:08:44,742
They're still
humans, aren't they?

157
00:08:44,775 --> 00:08:46,842
So how can you tell them to die?

158
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:50,242
-They are the enemy who've sold
their souls to the Homunculi.

159
00:08:50,275 --> 00:08:51,875
All Homunculi must die!

160
00:08:51,908 --> 00:08:53,242
They must be eliminated!

161
00:08:53,275 --> 00:08:54,042
-Stop it!

162
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:55,642
They're still human beings.

163
00:08:55,675 --> 00:08:57,075
It's not too late for them yet.

164
00:08:57,108 --> 00:08:58,842
They could start over.

165
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:02,608
The last time, I know I
failed trying to save Chouno,

166
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:06,175
but this time I--
this time I will!

167
00:09:09,642 --> 00:09:13,875
-So, are you telling me that you
are going to protect the enemy?

168
00:09:13,908 --> 00:09:15,075
-Look at them.

169
00:09:15,108 --> 00:09:16,908
In their current condition,
they pose no threat.

170
00:09:16,942 --> 00:09:20,175
In any case, I don't want
to kill unnecessarily.

171
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:24,775
And honestly, Tokiko, I
don't want you to either.

172
00:09:24,808 --> 00:09:26,342
-Kazuki.

173
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:27,975
You're just one big dilemma.

174
00:09:28,008 --> 00:09:30,775
Your kindness becomes your
liability during a fight,

175
00:09:30,808 --> 00:09:33,442
and I'm afraid that one
day, that liability's

176
00:09:33,475 --> 00:09:35,075
going to get you killed.

177
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:37,475
So before that
happens, I'm gonna

178
00:09:37,508 --> 00:09:40,375
take away your means to fight.

179
00:09:40,408 --> 00:09:43,142
I'm sorry, Kazuki, but I'm
taking away your fighting

180
00:09:43,175 --> 00:09:47,275
strength and putting an end
to your life as a Warrior!

181
00:09:47,308 --> 00:09:48,742
-No, Tokiko.

182
00:09:48,775 --> 00:09:50,675
Please, don't!

183
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:53,575
-Ouka, are you all right?

184
00:09:53,608 --> 00:09:55,042
Ouka.

185
00:09:55,075 --> 00:09:56,908
-I'm fine.

186
00:09:56,942 --> 00:10:02,842
But I guess, either
way, it's over, Shusui.

187
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:04,675
We've failed our mission.

188
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:07,108
Now either we get
eaten by the Homunculi,

189
00:10:07,142 --> 00:10:10,942
or get killed by an
Alchemist Warrior.

190
00:10:10,975 --> 00:10:14,742
We've already lost.

191
00:10:14,775 --> 00:10:17,608
-Huh?

192
00:10:17,642 --> 00:10:18,542
-Move aside!

193
00:10:22,542 --> 00:10:25,475
I can't believe you
didn't run away.

194
00:10:25,508 --> 00:10:26,375
-Why?

195
00:10:26,408 --> 00:10:28,675
Our fate is already sealed.

196
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:31,142
-That's very commendable of you.

197
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:45,775
Kazuki!

198
00:10:45,808 --> 00:10:46,575
I told you.

199
00:10:46,608 --> 00:10:48,308
You can't kill them.

200
00:10:48,342 --> 00:10:49,075
Don't you see?

201
00:10:49,108 --> 00:10:50,675
They're still human beings.

202
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:52,042
-You don't understand.

203
00:10:52,075 --> 00:10:53,775
They are allied
with the Homunculi.

204
00:10:53,808 --> 00:10:54,908
Can't you see that?

205
00:10:54,942 --> 00:10:56,942
Who do you want to save
in the end, your sister

206
00:10:56,975 --> 00:10:58,542
and friends, or these two?

207
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:00,275
Tell me, Kazuki.

208
00:11:00,308 --> 00:11:01,342
-All of them.

209
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:04,875
I want to protect every
single one of them!

210
00:11:04,908 --> 00:11:07,375
-Stop fooling around, and
make a choice, will you?

211
00:11:07,408 --> 00:11:08,575
-I can't!

212
00:11:08,608 --> 00:11:11,108
I'm not going to choose
who lives and who dies.

213
00:11:11,142 --> 00:11:13,775
I'm always going to
save every life I can.

214
00:11:13,808 --> 00:11:15,608
I owe it to you.

215
00:11:15,642 --> 00:11:19,342
Tokiko, that the first night
when we met, you gave me life.

216
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:22,875
You even gave up a precious
Kakugane to save my life.

217
00:11:22,908 --> 00:11:25,508
And because you saved
my life, I didn't

218
00:11:25,542 --> 00:11:28,408
have to be separated from
Mahiro or my friends.

219
00:11:28,442 --> 00:11:31,242
And I also got to
know you, Tokiko.

220
00:11:31,275 --> 00:11:34,042
Perhaps that night, it
also meant a new beginning

221
00:11:34,075 --> 00:11:35,208
for the twins.

222
00:11:35,242 --> 00:11:37,108
Maybe we're meant to help them.

223
00:11:37,142 --> 00:11:40,675
To end their world of
loneliness and start a new life.

224
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:43,508
And that is why you
can't end their lives

225
00:11:43,542 --> 00:11:44,642
like it doesn't matter.

226
00:11:44,675 --> 00:11:48,408
[groan]

227
00:11:48,442 --> 00:11:51,708
-I want to become as
powerful as I possibly can.

228
00:11:51,742 --> 00:11:55,908
The stronger I become, the
closer we get to our wish.

229
00:11:55,942 --> 00:11:56,742
Ha!

230
00:11:56,775 --> 00:11:57,308
SHUSUI (VOICEOVER): I'll win.

231
00:11:57,342 --> 00:11:58,108
I can't lose!

232
00:11:58,142 --> 00:11:58,842
Not here.

233
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:00,575
Not now!

234
00:12:00,608 --> 00:12:01,075
-Kazuki!

235
00:12:19,342 --> 00:12:20,308
-Huh?

236
00:12:20,342 --> 00:12:23,275
Ouka.

237
00:12:23,308 --> 00:12:24,742
Ouka!

238
00:12:24,775 --> 00:12:26,242
Ouka!

239
00:12:26,275 --> 00:12:27,442
Ouka!

240
00:12:27,475 --> 00:12:31,242
Why-- did you do that?

241
00:12:31,275 --> 00:12:35,508
-I thought back then,
when the door was locked

242
00:12:35,542 --> 00:12:38,775
in that apartment,
when we were little,

243
00:12:38,808 --> 00:12:40,575
and we were screaming,
asking for help,

244
00:12:40,608 --> 00:12:42,808
trying to get
out-- if Kazuki had

245
00:12:42,842 --> 00:12:45,808
been right outside, or
nearby, I have no doubt

246
00:12:45,842 --> 00:12:47,942
he would have come
in and saved us.

247
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:49,275
I'm sure of it.

248
00:12:49,308 --> 00:12:53,208
I tought, he might have
become our good friend.

249
00:12:53,242 --> 00:12:56,575
And I imagined a better
life, we would have never

250
00:12:56,608 --> 00:13:00,575
lost our faith in people.

251
00:13:00,608 --> 00:13:03,508
'Til death do us
part, and I guess

252
00:13:03,542 --> 00:13:05,442
that time has finally come.

253
00:13:05,475 --> 00:13:07,542
Goodbye, my Shusui.

254
00:13:07,575 --> 00:13:12,308
Thanks for everything
that you've done.

255
00:13:12,342 --> 00:13:13,475
-No, not yet!

256
00:13:13,508 --> 00:13:15,075
Don't give up, Ouka!

257
00:13:15,108 --> 00:13:16,442
The Kakugane.

258
00:13:16,475 --> 00:13:18,775
The healing power of the
Kakugane can save her.

259
00:13:23,508 --> 00:13:24,942
-It's no use.

260
00:13:24,975 --> 00:13:26,342
The bleeding won't stop.

261
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:28,608
-You mean two of them
still aren't enough?

262
00:13:28,642 --> 00:13:29,108
Tokiko.

263
00:13:31,642 --> 00:13:33,142
In the condition
that I'm in, there's

264
00:13:33,175 --> 00:13:36,608
no way I can remove the
Kakugane from my body.

265
00:13:36,642 --> 00:13:38,775
Tokiko, the choice is yours.

266
00:13:38,808 --> 00:13:41,508
You can either save
her, or let her die.

267
00:13:41,542 --> 00:13:42,808
-My choice, huh?

268
00:13:42,842 --> 00:13:45,508
But when I asked you to
choose just a minute ago,

269
00:13:45,542 --> 00:13:47,142
you didn't even bother.

270
00:13:47,175 --> 00:13:48,475
[gulp]

271
00:13:48,508 --> 00:13:50,275
-Fine.

272
00:13:50,308 --> 00:13:53,642
Unlike you, I am going
to make a choice.

273
00:13:53,675 --> 00:13:57,042
Buso Renkin, deactivate.

274
00:13:57,075 --> 00:13:59,375
-Thank you, Tokiko.

275
00:13:59,408 --> 00:14:00,475
-Yeah, whatever.

276
00:14:00,508 --> 00:14:03,642
And if that doesn't
help, then too bad.

277
00:14:03,675 --> 00:14:04,642
KAZUKI: Al right.

278
00:14:04,675 --> 00:14:05,508
The bleeding stopped.

279
00:14:05,542 --> 00:14:06,442
Good.

280
00:14:06,475 --> 00:14:08,075
We can save her

281
00:14:08,108 --> 00:14:12,208
-In times of sickness,
and in health.

282
00:14:12,242 --> 00:14:14,508
-In joy, and in sorrow.

283
00:14:14,542 --> 00:14:16,442
SHUSUI: For richer.

284
00:14:16,475 --> 00:14:18,175
OUKA: Or for poorer.

285
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:18,942
SHUSUI: To love--

286
00:14:18,975 --> 00:14:20,542
OUKA: And cherish.

287
00:14:20,575 --> 00:14:21,975
YOUNG SUSHUI AND
OUKA (VOICEOVER):

288
00:14:22,008 --> 00:14:25,042
To comfort and
protect, from this day

289
00:14:25,075 --> 00:14:27,908
forward, 'til death do us part.

290
00:14:27,942 --> 00:14:30,275
Will you promise to
live together forever?

291
00:14:33,108 --> 00:14:34,808
PAPILLON: How touching.

292
00:14:34,842 --> 00:14:37,742
I'm so glad you didn't have
to go through a situation

293
00:14:37,775 --> 00:14:39,008
like you did last time.

294
00:14:42,575 --> 00:14:46,142
But it might be a different
story for those twins.

295
00:14:46,175 --> 00:14:49,908
You know, even if a new
world is opened up for them,

296
00:14:49,942 --> 00:14:53,408
they have already experienced
the dark world of alchemy

297
00:14:53,442 --> 00:14:54,375
far too deeply.

298
00:14:54,408 --> 00:14:55,442
MOONFACE: And
that's not something

299
00:14:55,475 --> 00:14:57,775
you can leave behind so easily.

300
00:14:57,808 --> 00:15:00,608
-Mm?

301
00:15:03,555 --> 00:15:05,088
-Moon.

302
00:15:05,121 --> 00:15:07,321
Life can be so ephemeral.

303
00:15:07,355 --> 00:15:07,821
Moon!

304
00:15:10,588 --> 00:15:12,255
-What are you doing here?

305
00:15:12,288 --> 00:15:14,588
Being their watcher is my duty.

306
00:15:14,621 --> 00:15:16,988
-Taking a stroll
in the moonlight.

307
00:15:17,021 --> 00:15:18,688
But you know something?

308
00:15:18,721 --> 00:15:21,988
I was actually curious
about that infamous Warrior.

309
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:24,855
The one that defeated you
when you became a Homunculus.

310
00:15:24,888 --> 00:15:29,088
But frankly, I'm
not very impressed.

311
00:15:29,121 --> 00:15:31,121
Now come on, don't
scowl like that.

312
00:15:31,155 --> 00:15:32,721
Give me a smile.

313
00:15:32,755 --> 00:15:34,055
Aw.

314
00:15:34,088 --> 00:15:36,455
I have no intention of getting
involved with your enemy,

315
00:15:36,488 --> 00:15:38,355
but I'll admit I'm
planning to make

316
00:15:38,388 --> 00:15:40,521
those two failures my dinner.

317
00:15:40,555 --> 00:15:42,521
Come to think of it, on
the night we found them,

318
00:15:42,555 --> 00:15:44,921
it was a full moon,
like this one.

319
00:15:44,955 --> 00:15:46,455
I thought they had such promise.

320
00:15:46,488 --> 00:15:47,888
I really did.

321
00:15:47,921 --> 00:15:48,388
Oh?

322
00:15:53,221 --> 00:15:54,088
-Comet Bravo Kick.

323
00:15:56,855 --> 00:15:58,288
BRAVO AND MOONFACE:
Bizarre looking.

324
00:15:58,321 --> 00:15:59,288
-I see.

325
00:15:59,321 --> 00:16:01,188
So you are the third one.

326
00:16:01,221 --> 00:16:03,488
And I bet you're
also the leader.

327
00:16:03,521 --> 00:16:04,621
Am I right?

328
00:16:04,655 --> 00:16:07,088
-If you plan to lay your
hands on those children,

329
00:16:07,121 --> 00:16:08,621
you're gonna have
to deal with me.

330
00:16:08,655 --> 00:16:09,821
-With pleasure.

331
00:16:09,855 --> 00:16:12,888
But as much as I'd like
to, unfortunately I've

332
00:16:12,921 --> 00:16:15,788
been told by Dr. Butterfly
to restrain myself.

333
00:16:15,821 --> 00:16:18,321
It's a shame, but I guess
I should follow orders.

334
00:16:18,355 --> 00:16:20,655
What's your name?

335
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,821
-Captain Bravo.

336
00:16:22,855 --> 00:16:23,688
-Moon.

337
00:16:23,721 --> 00:16:25,388
What a magnificent name.

338
00:16:25,421 --> 00:16:27,055
My name is Moonface.

339
00:16:27,088 --> 00:16:30,355
I'm sure we'll meet
in battle soon enough.

340
00:16:30,388 --> 00:16:33,088
Moon!

341
00:16:33,121 --> 00:16:34,188
-Yes.

342
00:16:34,221 --> 00:16:36,021
I'm sure we will.

343
00:16:36,055 --> 00:16:38,755
The other one has left, as well.

344
00:16:38,788 --> 00:16:41,788
BOY: It's been 10 days since
the Hayasaka twins were in a car

345
00:16:41,821 --> 00:16:43,388
accident, and we're
just finding out

346
00:16:43,421 --> 00:16:44,721
where they've been hospitalized?

347
00:16:44,755 --> 00:16:47,321
-Let's go visit them!

348
00:16:47,355 --> 00:16:48,655
-Car accident?

349
00:16:48,688 --> 00:16:49,588
-Don't ask.

350
00:16:49,621 --> 00:16:51,955
That's outside of
my jurisdiction.

351
00:16:51,988 --> 00:16:54,921
Those twins have now been placed
in the custody of the Warrior

352
00:16:54,955 --> 00:16:56,321
Chief.

353
00:16:56,355 --> 00:16:59,621
I wonder how much information
he was able to get from them?

354
00:16:59,655 --> 00:17:00,988
-It's good he's got it covered.

355
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:03,855
I just really hope
they're getting better.

356
00:17:03,888 --> 00:17:06,455
-Only authorized persons
are allowed to visit.

357
00:17:09,288 --> 00:17:11,721
-What does that really mean?

358
00:17:11,755 --> 00:17:14,955
I wonder if we need to be
family members to be let in?

359
00:17:14,988 --> 00:17:18,155
-What exactly is our
relationship to them, anyway?

360
00:17:18,188 --> 00:17:19,388
-Well, we're just classmates.

361
00:17:19,421 --> 00:17:20,588
-Not true!

362
00:17:20,621 --> 00:17:23,221
We've already compared
sizes with them, remember?

363
00:17:23,255 --> 00:17:26,588
That makes us practically
family, don't you think?

364
00:17:26,621 --> 00:17:28,521
-What the hell were
you guys doing?

365
00:17:28,555 --> 00:17:30,921
MAHIRO: Well, in that case,
we're just as qualified.

366
00:17:30,955 --> 00:17:33,255
-You compared sizes, too?

367
00:17:33,288 --> 00:17:34,255
-Most definitely!

368
00:17:34,288 --> 00:17:35,321
-In that case, get ready!

369
00:17:35,355 --> 00:17:36,121
Let's go for it!

370
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:37,621
Charge!

371
00:17:37,655 --> 00:17:39,121
[shouting]

372
00:17:39,155 --> 00:17:40,621
-What the hell are you doing?

373
00:17:40,655 --> 00:17:42,621
If you fool around
with medical personnel,

374
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:44,088
get ready to pay the price.

375
00:17:44,121 --> 00:17:47,288
-When it comes to your health,
remember that we doctors always

376
00:17:47,321 --> 00:17:48,388
know what is best.

377
00:17:48,421 --> 00:17:50,388
-We can take on a bunch
of junk food punks.

378
00:17:50,421 --> 00:17:51,921
-We're ready, so bring it on.

379
00:17:55,321 --> 00:17:56,988
-What is wrong
with this hospital?

380
00:17:57,021 --> 00:17:58,155
-Hey, Kazuki!

381
00:17:58,188 --> 00:17:59,455
Catch this!

382
00:17:59,488 --> 00:18:00,388
-Got it!

383
00:18:00,421 --> 00:18:01,755
-Kazuki, this too!

384
00:18:01,788 --> 00:18:02,255
-What?

385
00:18:05,055 --> 00:18:06,755
-Hello, Mr. Bravo.

386
00:18:06,788 --> 00:18:08,655
So are you here
for another visit?

387
00:18:08,688 --> 00:18:09,488
-Yes.

388
00:18:09,521 --> 00:18:10,888
Thank you for everything.

389
00:18:10,921 --> 00:18:11,688
DOCTOR: Quick!

390
00:18:11,721 --> 00:18:13,421
Those two are getting away!

391
00:18:13,455 --> 00:18:14,221
-Hey, there!

392
00:18:14,255 --> 00:18:17,155
No running in the hallways.

393
00:18:17,188 --> 00:18:19,655
This hospital has connections
with headquarters.

394
00:18:19,688 --> 00:18:21,521
They accommodate our
needs well, and we

395
00:18:21,555 --> 00:18:23,155
have a little freedom here.

396
00:18:23,188 --> 00:18:24,455
[knocking]

397
00:18:24,488 --> 00:18:25,221
-Ouka?

398
00:18:25,255 --> 00:18:28,021
We're coming in.

399
00:18:28,055 --> 00:18:31,055
-Hey there, Bravo, my buddy!

400
00:18:31,088 --> 00:18:33,855
Now, don't you get tired
of coming every day?

401
00:18:33,888 --> 00:18:34,688
Oh!

402
00:18:34,721 --> 00:18:35,988
You're here too, Kazuki?

403
00:18:36,021 --> 00:18:37,555
Great.

404
00:18:37,588 --> 00:18:40,055
-Ouka can't hold long
conversations yet,

405
00:18:40,088 --> 00:18:43,255
so I'm interrogating her by
leaving Angel Gozen's speaking

406
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,121
ability turned on.

407
00:18:45,155 --> 00:18:46,388
-Yup!

408
00:18:46,421 --> 00:18:47,188
-Wow.

409
00:18:47,221 --> 00:18:49,221
It's a talking Buso Renkin.

410
00:18:49,255 --> 00:18:51,755
-A pretty stupid
one, if you ask me.

411
00:18:51,788 --> 00:18:52,255
-Mm?

412
00:18:52,288 --> 00:18:53,455
What was that?

413
00:18:53,488 --> 00:18:55,421
Oh, lookie here, scarface
calling me stupid.

414
00:18:55,455 --> 00:18:58,088
Well, what's your
weapon, a Valkyrie Skirt?

415
00:18:58,121 --> 00:18:59,155
Ha!

416
00:18:59,188 --> 00:19:01,088
So which part is the
death scythe, huh?

417
00:19:01,121 --> 00:19:01,655
No!

418
00:19:01,688 --> 00:19:02,188
Please!

419
00:19:02,221 --> 00:19:03,288
Help, help!

420
00:19:03,321 --> 00:19:05,555
TOKIKO: I'm actually
curious about its AI.

421
00:19:05,588 --> 00:19:07,221
Can I take it apart?

422
00:19:07,255 --> 00:19:09,655
BRAVO: I was pretty
curious about that, myself.

423
00:19:09,688 --> 00:19:11,421
Let's see.

424
00:19:11,455 --> 00:19:14,855
Bravo Arts 1 of 13,
all-seeing Bravo Eye.

425
00:19:18,021 --> 00:19:19,288
I got it.

426
00:19:19,321 --> 00:19:20,288
-Amazing.

427
00:19:20,321 --> 00:19:22,088
Is that another
ability of Silver Skin?

428
00:19:22,121 --> 00:19:23,188
-Negative!

429
00:19:23,221 --> 00:19:25,821
This sight is a result
of intense training.

430
00:19:25,855 --> 00:19:29,421
It seems like Ouka and Gozen
share their consciousness.

431
00:19:29,455 --> 00:19:34,921
In other words, Gozen is
a part of Ouka Hayasaka.

432
00:19:34,955 --> 00:19:37,588
-So what is he hiding
behind that smile?

433
00:19:37,621 --> 00:19:40,888
-Hey, by the way, Ouka--
where did Shusui go?

434
00:19:45,821 --> 00:19:50,055
-Shusui Hayasaka was already
discharged this morning.

435
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:53,055
So then, you want to go
into training right away?

436
00:19:53,088 --> 00:19:54,188
-Yes.

437
00:19:54,221 --> 00:19:55,821
I'm going back to training
with a swordmaster

438
00:19:55,855 --> 00:19:57,855
I've trained with before.

439
00:19:57,888 --> 00:20:00,121
-Tell me, are you trying
to become stronger

440
00:20:00,155 --> 00:20:01,188
in order to defeat Kazuki?

441
00:20:05,888 --> 00:20:07,255
-No.

442
00:20:07,288 --> 00:20:10,921
The one I wish to
overcome is myself.

443
00:20:10,955 --> 00:20:12,188
-Very well.

444
00:20:12,221 --> 00:20:14,588
But I need to
confiscate the Kakugane.

445
00:20:14,621 --> 00:20:17,821
And also, I need you to promise
that you will contact us once

446
00:20:17,855 --> 00:20:20,588
a week.

447
00:20:20,621 --> 00:20:22,621
-Dear Ouka--

448
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,921
I understand.

449
00:20:23,955 --> 00:20:25,821
Take care of yourself.

450
00:20:25,855 --> 00:20:27,121
-I'm sorry.

451
00:20:27,155 --> 00:20:28,588
But I promise I will come back.

452
00:20:34,588 --> 00:20:40,321
-Up until now, we had pledged to
live together forever and ever.

453
00:20:40,355 --> 00:20:43,321
But we were just
clinging to each other.

454
00:20:43,355 --> 00:20:46,588
We closed ourselves off
in our own little world,

455
00:20:46,621 --> 00:20:49,488
and were afraid one day
we had to part in death.

456
00:20:49,521 --> 00:20:53,621
From now then, we're going
to stand on our own two feet.

457
00:20:53,655 --> 00:20:58,388
I'll walk on my own, and
I will live on my own.

458
00:20:58,421 --> 00:21:02,655
Then we both live
in the real world.

459
00:21:02,688 --> 00:21:03,821
BRAVO: This is for you.

460
00:21:03,855 --> 00:21:04,321
From Shusui.

461
00:21:14,221 --> 00:21:15,488
-Ah!

462
00:21:15,521 --> 00:21:17,688
I thought something smelled
really good. is it melon?

463
00:21:17,721 --> 00:21:19,088
-Oh, I almost forgot.

464
00:21:19,121 --> 00:21:20,388
Here you go.

465
00:21:20,421 --> 00:21:22,988
Enjoy.

466
00:21:23,021 --> 00:21:23,955
-Huh?

467
00:21:23,988 --> 00:21:24,788
Ah!

468
00:21:24,821 --> 00:21:25,921
Ah, this is covered with blood!

469
00:21:25,955 --> 00:21:28,655
-And these flowers
are for you, Ouka.

470
00:21:28,688 --> 00:21:31,355
From Mahiro and the others.

471
00:21:31,388 --> 00:21:32,788
-They smell really nice.

472
00:21:32,821 --> 00:21:35,155
-Everyone was very
worried about you.

473
00:21:35,188 --> 00:21:36,588
When you get better,
we should all

474
00:21:36,621 --> 00:21:39,955
get together and hang
out, or something.

475
00:21:39,988 --> 00:21:42,321
This truly is a new beginning.

476
00:21:42,355 --> 00:21:43,788
You don't have to
be alone anymore.

477
00:21:48,588 --> 00:21:53,655
-They-- they really
do smell wonderful.

478
00:21:53,688 --> 00:21:59,721
I wish I could share them with
Shusui right now, you know?

479
00:21:59,755 --> 00:22:03,288
-Are those flowers I smell?

480
00:22:03,321 --> 00:22:06,121
Must be my imagination.

481
00:22:06,155 --> 00:22:09,121
But in any case, they
sure did smell nice.

Students screaming echoed in
front of countless monsters,

other sacrifices like before.

00:24:14,226 --> 00:24:15,526
-Hi!

490
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:18,560
This is Mahiro Muto, once again
introducing the Buso Renkin

491
00:24:18,593 --> 00:24:20,526
so everyone can understand.

492
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:23,726
Our fourth presentation is
the Angel Gozen and the Sword

493
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,560
Samurai X. They're
beautiful, handsome, smart,

494
00:24:27,593 --> 00:24:29,326
and also athletically
outstanding.

495
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,893
No matter how you look at
them, the twin siblings Ouka

496
00:24:32,926 --> 00:24:36,093
and Shusui Hayasaka
are just perfect.

497
00:24:36,126 --> 00:24:38,893
But the two were LXE Familiars.

498
00:24:38,926 --> 00:24:41,193
There they each
received a Kakugane,

499
00:24:41,226 --> 00:24:44,326
which gave them the
power of Buso Renkin.

500
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,293
For Ouka, Angel Gozen.

501
00:24:46,326 --> 00:24:50,726
And for Shusui, the Sword
Samurai X. Angel Gozen's

502
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:54,526
distinctive characteristic
is the cutesy ugly automaton

503
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,960
Angel Gozen.

504
00:24:55,993 --> 00:24:59,160
Angel Gozen shares its
consciousness with Ouka,

505
00:24:59,193 --> 00:25:02,626
and seems busy being angry
and crying all the time.

506
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:05,060
But that is supposed
to be just another side

507
00:25:05,093 --> 00:25:07,960
of Ouka's personality.

508
00:25:07,993 --> 00:25:11,526
Tokiko thinks it's a
true reflection of Ouka,

509
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,660
because that woman
is dark hearted.

510
00:25:13,693 --> 00:25:15,593
Oh, and another thing.

511
00:25:15,626 --> 00:25:18,526
When attacking, Angel Gozen
uses Ouka's bow and arrow

512
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,526
to create high speed shots.

513
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,626
That's right.

514
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:25,193
It is perfectly capable
of attacking, as well.

515
00:25:25,226 --> 00:25:27,626
Ouka can transfer physical
changes to herself

516
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:30,026
by shooting others
with her arrow.

517
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:33,060
She used this ability
to save my big brother.

518
00:25:33,093 --> 00:25:36,360
Oh, this must have
really hurt, I'm sure.

519
00:25:36,393 --> 00:25:37,493
-Oh!

520
00:25:37,526 --> 00:25:41,826
And it turned out Ouka
is a really nice person.

521
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:44,826
Oh, I just knew she was.

522
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:47,360
Now, moving on to Shusui.

523
00:25:47,393 --> 00:25:50,526
He's the one who gave my
big brother a tough battle.

524
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:54,593
His Buso Renkin is
Sword Samurai X.

525
00:25:54,626 --> 00:25:57,360
Because Shusui is
a master of kendo,

526
00:25:57,393 --> 00:25:59,260
he must have the
strength of Samson

527
00:25:59,293 --> 00:26:01,260
to wield a Japanese katana.

528
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:05,026
But the Sword Samurai X also
has the special property

529
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:07,793
to neutralize energy
based attacks.

530
00:26:07,826 --> 00:26:10,393
The blade absorbs the
energy, and releases it

531
00:26:10,426 --> 00:26:12,126
from the bottom
cord, which means

532
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:15,726
all of Kazuki's energy based
attacks with the Sunlight Heart

533
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,126
are absorbed, and therefore
have no effect on Shusui.

534
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,393
Kazuki himself
thought he was done

535
00:26:21,426 --> 00:26:24,426
for when he was faced
with a special property.

536
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:26,893
Ouka and Shusui have
been through a lot,

537
00:26:26,926 --> 00:26:28,860
but thanks to
Kazuki's kind heart,

538
00:26:28,893 --> 00:26:31,826
they've changed their ways,
and now the both of them

539
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,193
are our friends!

540
00:26:33,226 --> 00:26:34,726
We even compared
each others' sizes,

541
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,960
so we have an unbreakable bond.

542
00:26:37,993 --> 00:26:40,493
I would love for all of us
to hang out together sometime

543
00:26:40,526 --> 00:26:41,326
again.

544
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,160
Okie dokie, tune in next time!
