NARRATOR: The supernatural
alloy produced

2
00:00:14,466 --> 00:00:18,900
by gathering the essence
of alchemy is the Kakugane.

3
00:00:18,933 --> 00:00:22,866
This device activates upon a
person's fighting instinct,

4
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,466
manifesting the
possessor's inner power

5
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,100
into a tangible form, creating
a weapon like no other.

6
00:00:30,133 --> 00:00:32,533
Its name, Buso Renkin.

[theme music]

8
00:02:11,055 --> 00:02:13,022
NARRATOR: In order to
prevent his transformation

9
00:02:13,055 --> 00:02:15,488
into a Victor, Kazuki,
Tokiko, and Gota

10
00:02:15,522 --> 00:02:18,488
headed towards Newton
Apple Academy for Girls,

11
00:02:18,522 --> 00:02:23,188
where Tokiko originally
retrieved the black Kakugane.

12
00:02:23,222 --> 00:02:25,688
Meanwhile, at the Alchemist
Army headquarters,

13
00:02:25,722 --> 00:02:27,688
a Kazuki re-extermination
squad was

14
00:02:27,722 --> 00:02:30,588
formed, along with
Victor search squad.

15
00:02:30,622 --> 00:02:32,322
The re-extermination
squad, which

16
00:02:32,355 --> 00:02:35,355
consists of Hiwatari,
Negoro, and Ikusabe

17
00:02:35,388 --> 00:02:38,088
were confronted by Papillon,
who is also after Kazuki.

18
00:02:43,988 --> 00:02:46,122
In order to learn where
Kazuki was headed to,

19
00:02:46,155 --> 00:02:47,088
Papillon battled Ikusabe.

20
00:02:55,122 --> 00:02:58,088
Meanwhile, Hiwatori
and Negoro caught up

21
00:02:58,122 --> 00:02:59,855
with Kazuki and the others.

22
00:03:03,355 --> 00:03:06,988
-Unless I move forward, my
life, and the lives of the ones

23
00:03:07,022 --> 00:03:09,522
I care for will be over.

24
00:03:09,555 --> 00:03:10,622
So let us pass.

25
00:03:24,922 --> 00:03:26,888
Just move out of our way.

26
00:03:26,922 --> 00:03:27,888
-There's no way in hell.

27
00:03:36,888 --> 00:03:37,855
-Here he comes!

28
00:03:43,855 --> 00:03:44,322
-Heh.

29
00:03:57,322 --> 00:04:00,522
-I must admit, Homunculus,
you're pretty good.

30
00:04:00,555 --> 00:04:04,722
Unfortunately, you can't seem
to shake your exhaustion.

31
00:04:04,755 --> 00:04:08,422
Right now my only desire is to
become more powerful and fight

32
00:04:08,455 --> 00:04:11,055
against an entity stronger
than a Homunculus.

33
00:04:11,088 --> 00:04:12,588
It's time I put an
end to this fight.

34
00:04:16,755 --> 00:04:18,755
-It seems you don't get it.

35
00:04:18,788 --> 00:04:20,322
I've already figured
out the weakness

36
00:04:20,355 --> 00:04:21,988
of that spear of yours.

37
00:04:26,522 --> 00:04:29,922
-My Gekisen has no weaknesses.

38
00:04:29,955 --> 00:04:32,722
This rapid regeneration
is unbeatable.

39
00:04:35,355 --> 00:04:37,522
[scream]

40
00:04:37,555 --> 00:04:41,622
-High speed automatic
restoration means its speed

41
00:04:41,655 --> 00:04:46,355
and timing cannot be
controlled by the user.

42
00:04:46,388 --> 00:04:49,155
Whatever the circumstances,
the restoration

43
00:04:49,188 --> 00:04:50,988
will start instantly.

44
00:04:51,022 --> 00:04:52,288
All I need to do--

45
00:04:52,322 --> 00:04:54,288
-Pappy!

46
00:04:54,322 --> 00:04:56,288
-Is stop it in its tracks.

47
00:04:56,322 --> 00:04:57,588
-Huh?

48
00:04:57,622 --> 00:05:01,222
-By placing a foreign object
just in the nick of time.

49
00:05:01,255 --> 00:05:03,388
And the restoration fails.

50
00:05:03,422 --> 00:05:05,355
-You bastard!

51
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:07,222
-So, you want to
fight an entity more

52
00:05:07,255 --> 00:05:09,422
powerful than a
Homunculus, right?

53
00:05:09,455 --> 00:05:11,555
If I'm in the mood, then
I'll fight you later.

54
00:05:16,822 --> 00:05:19,822
Until then, I might
suggest you try

55
00:05:19,855 --> 00:05:21,722
becoming a little bit stronger.

56
00:05:21,755 --> 00:05:25,188
[scream]

57
00:05:25,222 --> 00:05:27,188
-Yeah, you did it, Pappy!

58
00:05:27,222 --> 00:05:28,155
Wah!

59
00:05:28,188 --> 00:05:28,788
Pappy!

60
00:05:28,822 --> 00:05:30,155
Are you all right?

61
00:05:30,188 --> 00:05:32,655
Is everything OK?

62
00:05:32,688 --> 00:05:33,355
-Yes.

63
00:05:33,388 --> 00:05:35,288
I'm magnificent.

64
00:05:35,322 --> 00:05:37,322
-Is this really a time
to be striking a pose?

65
00:05:37,355 --> 00:05:40,988
That muscle man is gonna
restore himself any minute now!

66
00:05:41,022 --> 00:05:41,755
PAPILLON: It's OK.

67
00:05:41,788 --> 00:05:42,788
-Huh?

68
00:05:42,822 --> 00:05:45,688
-Even if the main
spear isn't damaged,

69
00:05:45,722 --> 00:05:47,488
without the spear in
his hands, there's

70
00:05:47,522 --> 00:05:50,355
absolutely no way that
he'll be able to activate

71
00:05:50,388 --> 00:05:52,222
the rapid regeneration.

72
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,822
-What do you mean by that?

73
00:05:53,855 --> 00:05:57,955
-The spear will not know
whether he is injured or not.

74
00:05:57,988 --> 00:05:59,822
If it can't detect
his injuries, then it

75
00:05:59,855 --> 00:06:01,688
won't know he needs healing.

76
00:06:01,722 --> 00:06:07,055
In other words, you can now
pronounce me the victor.

77
00:06:07,088 --> 00:06:08,955
[laughter]

78
00:06:08,988 --> 00:06:11,522
-I really didn't think
you'd do that, knowing it

79
00:06:11,555 --> 00:06:13,022
would destroy us both.

80
00:06:13,055 --> 00:06:14,622
-Destroy us both?

81
00:06:14,655 --> 00:06:16,622
Are you kidding me?

82
00:06:16,655 --> 00:06:19,722
No matter what it
takes, I am determined

83
00:06:19,755 --> 00:06:22,055
to reach Kazuki Muto.

84
00:06:22,088 --> 00:06:24,555
-Is your goal really
that important to you?

85
00:06:24,588 --> 00:06:25,488
Tell me now.

86
00:06:25,522 --> 00:06:26,388
Is it?

87
00:06:26,422 --> 00:06:27,555
-I guess so.

88
00:06:27,588 --> 00:06:29,688
Now, a promise is a promise.

89
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:32,288
Let's hear where
Kazuki Muto is headed.

90
00:06:32,322 --> 00:06:34,155
That was our
agreement, wasn't it?

91
00:06:36,955 --> 00:06:40,255
-Newton Apple Academy for Girls.

92
00:06:40,288 --> 00:06:42,822
That's where they are going.

93
00:06:42,855 --> 00:06:43,955
PAPILLON: I see.

94
00:06:43,988 --> 00:06:46,688
-But I bet it's too late.

95
00:06:46,722 --> 00:06:48,088
-Why is that?

96
00:06:48,122 --> 00:06:51,322
-Surely by now,
Hiwatari and Negoro

97
00:06:51,355 --> 00:06:53,188
have already disposed of them.

98
00:06:53,222 --> 00:06:56,355
[groan]

99
00:06:56,388 --> 00:06:57,888
-So that's the situation.

100
00:06:57,922 --> 00:06:59,955
Did you get all that, Ouka?

101
00:06:59,988 --> 00:07:01,388
Look into it right away.

102
00:07:04,688 --> 00:07:07,055
-Hm?

103
00:07:07,088 --> 00:07:08,422
PAPILLON (VOICEOVER):
Kazuki Muto

104
00:07:08,455 --> 00:07:10,722
isn't the type to
die that easily.

105
00:07:20,855 --> 00:07:24,655
-You should be more careful not
to use too much firepower, sir.

106
00:07:24,688 --> 00:07:26,155
-Oh, shut up.

107
00:07:26,188 --> 00:07:28,522
It's best to just
finish off their type

108
00:07:28,555 --> 00:07:31,555
as quickly as you possibly can.

109
00:07:31,588 --> 00:07:33,922
-Where are you going?

110
00:07:33,955 --> 00:07:35,588
-I'm going back.

111
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:37,755
I'll leave finding
their Kakugane to you.

112
00:07:41,755 --> 00:07:42,222
-Understood.

113
00:07:50,288 --> 00:07:52,788
-So who's the guy
on the other side?

114
00:07:52,822 --> 00:07:54,222
-Oh, he looks handsome.

115
00:07:54,255 --> 00:07:55,855
He's totally my type.

116
00:07:55,888 --> 00:07:58,488
Tonight

117
00:07:58,522 --> 00:08:00,188
-Shisui Hayasaka.

118
00:08:00,222 --> 00:08:03,622
Until just recently,
he was an LXE Familiar.

119
00:08:03,655 --> 00:08:04,655
-I see.

120
00:08:04,688 --> 00:08:06,322
Well, I wonder if
he'll be of any use?

121
00:08:31,555 --> 00:08:32,555
-Victor.

122
00:08:32,588 --> 00:08:33,855
-Yes.

123
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:37,222
The mo important mission right
now is to hunt down Victor,

124
00:08:37,255 --> 00:08:39,888
and to eliminate him
as soon as possible.

125
00:08:39,922 --> 00:08:44,388
And for that battle, we're going
to need your help against him.

126
00:08:44,422 --> 00:08:46,322
-And Kazuki?

127
00:08:46,355 --> 00:08:50,155
Will Kazuki Muto be
involved as well?

128
00:08:50,188 --> 00:08:52,655
-He will not be involved.

129
00:09:03,655 --> 00:09:05,122
SHISUI: Kazuki.

130
00:09:05,155 --> 00:09:06,188
[beeping]

131
00:09:06,222 --> 00:09:09,122
-It appears that we
have located Victor.

132
00:09:14,622 --> 00:09:16,522
-They're here.

133
00:09:16,555 --> 00:09:19,355
The Alchemist
Warriors have come.

134
00:09:19,388 --> 00:09:21,055
-Tokiko.

135
00:09:21,088 --> 00:09:22,288
Tokiko.

136
00:09:22,322 --> 00:09:22,788
Tokiko!

137
00:09:28,188 --> 00:09:29,288
Thank goodness.

138
00:09:29,322 --> 00:09:31,255
You're conscious.

139
00:09:31,288 --> 00:09:32,255
-Where's Kazuki?

140
00:09:34,922 --> 00:09:35,388
G-- Gota?

141
00:09:38,488 --> 00:09:39,955
-I can't find him.

142
00:09:39,988 --> 00:09:42,988
It seems like after
the explosion,

143
00:09:43,022 --> 00:09:45,088
we were all blown into
different directions.

144
00:09:45,122 --> 00:09:48,288
-We must find Kazuki before the
re-extermination squad does.

145
00:09:48,322 --> 00:09:50,222
There's no time to
be resting here.

146
00:09:53,588 --> 00:09:55,788
-Tokiko.

147
00:09:55,822 --> 00:09:58,222
Please, just worry
about yourself

148
00:09:58,255 --> 00:10:00,355
before you worry about Kazuki.

149
00:10:00,388 --> 00:10:03,355
You received the main brunt
of Warrior Chief Hiwatari's

150
00:10:03,388 --> 00:10:04,655
attack.

151
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:06,822
I mean, it's amazing that
you're even alive right now.

152
00:10:10,555 --> 00:10:11,288
-Let's go.

153
00:10:15,022 --> 00:10:16,622
NEGORO: So you two
are still alive.

154
00:10:21,888 --> 00:10:24,088
Where is Victor Three?

155
00:10:24,122 --> 00:10:25,722
Is he alive as well?

156
00:10:25,755 --> 00:10:27,488
-Where-- where are you?

157
00:10:27,522 --> 00:10:30,222
NEGORO: Although you're
not my primary target,

158
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:32,622
eliminating you is also
part of the mission.

159
00:10:37,155 --> 00:10:37,622
-Tokiko!

160
00:10:46,244 --> 00:10:47,577
-Tokiko!

161
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:48,044
Gota!

162
00:10:51,444 --> 00:10:52,144
Where are they?

163
00:10:58,244 --> 00:10:59,144
-Damn you!

164
00:10:59,177 --> 00:11:00,110
You peeping Tom!

165
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:05,610
Are you all right, Tokiko?

166
00:11:05,644 --> 00:11:06,910
-Don't worry about me.

167
00:11:06,944 --> 00:11:07,644
He's coming back.

168
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:19,144
NEGORO: What are you aiming at?

169
00:11:21,777 --> 00:11:25,944
Buso Renkin of the Ninja Sword,
also known as Secret Trail.

170
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:28,510
For your information,
whatever this blade cuts,

171
00:11:28,544 --> 00:11:31,144
it becomes my secret path.

172
00:11:31,177 --> 00:11:32,877
-Gota, are you all right?

173
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:34,577
-I'm OK.

174
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:37,010
Stand back and let me
take care of this guy.

175
00:11:37,044 --> 00:11:39,610
-So then, you're protecting her.

176
00:11:39,644 --> 00:11:40,977
Very well, then.

177
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:44,610
It'll be much easier for me
to defeat my prey one by one.

178
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:52,744
GOTA (VOICEOVER): Dammit.

179
00:11:52,777 --> 00:11:56,777
Once he dives in, there's
no way to track him.

180
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:57,877
Think.

181
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:00,344
Where's he going to attack from?

182
00:12:00,377 --> 00:12:02,644
With that ability, it's
unlikely that he'll

183
00:12:02,677 --> 00:12:04,577
attack from the front.

184
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:07,610
He's probably going to aim for
the blind spot, like before.

185
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:10,444
Is it the back, or from below?

186
00:12:10,477 --> 00:12:14,477
Or is it from above?

187
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:16,977
Motor Gears,
Knuckle Duster Mode!

188
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:17,544
-Stop!

189
00:12:17,577 --> 00:12:19,244
Gota, look out!

190
00:12:19,277 --> 00:12:20,244
GOTA: A trick?

191
00:12:20,277 --> 00:12:21,677
Then that means he's--

192
00:12:27,977 --> 00:12:28,444
-Tokiko!

193
00:12:32,844 --> 00:12:33,644
-Thank you, Gota.

194
00:12:33,677 --> 00:12:35,844
-I'm-- I'm sorry.

195
00:12:35,877 --> 00:12:36,810
-Hm.

196
00:12:36,844 --> 00:12:38,677
Impressive.

197
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:40,110
-Get back here!

198
00:12:40,144 --> 00:12:41,577
I'm not letting you go.

199
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:44,477
I'm coming in with you!

200
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:46,577
NEGORO: Unfortunately
for you, this path

201
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:48,310
is reserved for me alone.

202
00:12:48,344 --> 00:12:49,777
No strangers.

203
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:54,277
Not even a speck of dust
can go through this pathway.

204
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:56,744
Damn it!

205
00:12:56,777 --> 00:12:59,377
Wait.

206
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:01,244
Not even a speck of dust?

207
00:13:01,277 --> 00:13:03,844
Then why is it that his clothes
are able to make it through?

208
00:13:03,877 --> 00:13:06,810
Does that mean his
possessions are the exception?

209
00:13:06,844 --> 00:13:07,744
Or maybe--

210
00:13:11,577 --> 00:13:12,744
-Hey.

211
00:13:12,777 --> 00:13:14,744
You were only targeting
Tokiko from the beginning,

212
00:13:14,777 --> 00:13:15,944
weren't you?

213
00:13:15,977 --> 00:13:18,177
NEGORO: What a silly question.

214
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:19,644
You said you were
going to fight me

215
00:13:19,677 --> 00:13:21,610
in order to protect the girl.

216
00:13:21,644 --> 00:13:23,977
And of course, I
acknowledged your wish.

217
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:29,344
However, I never said I would
fight abiding by your wishes.

218
00:13:29,377 --> 00:13:34,344
In a battle, the top priority
is to achieve victory.

219
00:13:34,377 --> 00:13:38,777
And to do that, I'll resort
to any means necessary.

220
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:41,210
-You've already aimed
for Tokiko twice.

221
00:13:41,244 --> 00:13:46,544
I also will resort to any
means, no matter what it takes!

222
00:13:46,577 --> 00:13:48,244
NEGORO: Here I come.

223
00:13:48,277 --> 00:13:49,677
-Bring it on.

224
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:51,677
The next time you show
yourself, you better

225
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:53,410
be ready for your defeat!

226
00:13:53,444 --> 00:13:55,077
-Here I come.

227
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:56,944
Buso Renkin of Floating Mine.

228
00:13:56,977 --> 00:13:58,477
Here comes a Bubble Cage!

229
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:23,644
The Bubble Cage
increases in number

230
00:14:23,677 --> 00:14:28,977
as it explodes and pressures
the space to restrict you.

231
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:29,944
Your turn, Inukai!

232
00:14:34,577 --> 00:14:35,044
-All right.

233
00:14:35,077 --> 00:14:36,110
Let's go.

234
00:14:36,144 --> 00:14:39,510
Buso Renkin of Military
Dog, Killer Rabies.

235
00:14:49,477 --> 00:14:51,044
-Sword Samurai X!

236
00:15:05,844 --> 00:15:07,810
-Hey, that kid is pretty good.

237
00:15:07,844 --> 00:15:10,144
-Not good enough.

238
00:15:10,177 --> 00:15:10,777
MAN: Damn.

239
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,044
He's still going.

240
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:13,877
-It's too dangerous to continue.

241
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:15,077
Let's just retreat for now.

242
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:17,210
-It really won't
make any difference.

243
00:15:17,244 --> 00:15:19,310
I think we should
go as far as we can.

244
00:15:19,344 --> 00:15:21,644
-With this many people,
even Victor can't.

245
00:15:21,677 --> 00:15:22,477
-Time to die.

246
00:15:26,977 --> 00:15:28,244
Buso Renkin of Great Axe.

247
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:34,677
Fatal Attraction!

248
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:48,477
-Wha-- What is this?

249
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:50,944
-I can't stand.

250
00:15:50,977 --> 00:15:54,410
-Is this gravity manipulation?

251
00:15:54,444 --> 00:15:56,910
-All Alchemist
Warriors must die!

252
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:01,810
-Buso Renkin of Gas Mask.

253
00:16:01,844 --> 00:16:02,777
Aerial Operator.

254
00:16:08,244 --> 00:16:09,177
All of you.

255
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:10,177
Now's our chance.

256
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:13,610
Leave this place immediately.

257
00:16:13,644 --> 00:16:14,577
Come on.

258
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:16,577
Let's go.

259
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:18,544
-We're saved.

260
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:19,510
-Very sneaky.

261
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:30,444
-Get out of here.

262
00:16:30,477 --> 00:16:30,944
Hurry.

263
00:16:40,877 --> 00:16:41,844
-Shisui.

264
00:16:41,877 --> 00:16:42,544
Let's go.

265
00:16:45,544 --> 00:16:47,444
-Hm.

266
00:16:47,477 --> 00:16:48,410
They've fled.

267
00:17:01,044 --> 00:17:03,077
-I knew it was the right
choice to bring you along

268
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:05,310
in the battle against Victor.

269
00:17:05,344 --> 00:17:08,944
Without you, we could've
been completely annihilated.

270
00:17:08,977 --> 00:17:10,844
-He's powerful.

271
00:17:10,877 --> 00:17:14,144
It's impossible for normal
Warriors to fight against him.

272
00:17:14,177 --> 00:17:15,444
-Yes, you're right.

273
00:17:15,477 --> 00:17:17,844
That Buso Renkin with
gravity manipulation

274
00:17:17,877 --> 00:17:19,977
is a serious threat, for sure.

275
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:23,944
But next time, we won't have
any trouble locating him

276
00:17:23,977 --> 00:17:27,444
since this Buso Renkin
of Radar, Hermes Drive,

277
00:17:27,477 --> 00:17:30,777
is now able to locate
Victor's signal.

278
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:32,944
-Are you really
sure it's this way?

279
00:17:32,977 --> 00:17:36,610
You know there is no absolute
guarantee that Kazuki has even

280
00:17:36,644 --> 00:17:39,344
reached Newton Apple Academy
for Girls at this point.

281
00:17:39,377 --> 00:17:41,844
That Ikusabe was quite
strong, and the two

282
00:17:41,877 --> 00:17:44,144
that were going after Kazuki
are probably the same.

283
00:17:44,177 --> 00:17:46,244
It could be all over by now.

284
00:17:46,277 --> 00:17:48,210
Kazuki could
already be defeated.

285
00:17:48,244 --> 00:17:49,177
Huh?

286
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:51,310
Wah!

287
00:17:51,344 --> 00:17:53,244
Oh no, Pappy, Pappy!

288
00:17:53,277 --> 00:17:55,444
Are you all right?

289
00:17:55,477 --> 00:17:55,944
-Fantastic!

290
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:00,310
-Pappy, Pappy, Pappy!

291
00:18:00,344 --> 00:18:01,544
Is everything all right?

292
00:18:01,577 --> 00:18:02,044
Huh?

293
00:18:02,077 --> 00:18:05,644
[snoring]

294
00:18:05,677 --> 00:18:06,144
-Uh.

295
00:18:09,544 --> 00:18:12,777
TOKIKO (VOICEOVER): It seems
Gota caught on to something.

296
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:14,577
Motor Gear's
offensive power is one

297
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:17,610
of the weakest among
the Buso Renkin.

298
00:18:17,644 --> 00:18:20,710
Gota's battle style is to
use creativity and strategy

299
00:18:20,744 --> 00:18:23,310
to compensate for that.

300
00:18:23,344 --> 00:18:27,677
When things click in Gota's
head, then he is very reliable.

301
00:18:31,344 --> 00:18:34,710
Just the sword!

302
00:18:34,744 --> 00:18:35,877
So then he--

303
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:37,510
NEGORO: How is it?

304
00:18:37,544 --> 00:18:39,877
From this inaccessible
dimension,

305
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:42,677
I can attack you
without showing myself.

306
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:45,810
Considering how you cannot
attack me in return,

307
00:18:45,844 --> 00:18:47,744
you're powerless.

308
00:18:47,777 --> 00:18:50,910
And this is the secret
trail's path to victory.

309
00:18:50,944 --> 00:18:52,710
I'll increase my speed.

310
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:03,977
-Gota!

311
00:19:08,444 --> 00:19:09,410
-Motor Gear!

312
00:19:09,444 --> 00:19:10,844
Skywalker Mode!

313
00:19:10,877 --> 00:19:13,077
-It's pointless.

314
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,144
Your act of escaping
means you've already

315
00:19:15,177 --> 00:19:18,310
fallen into my trap.

316
00:19:18,344 --> 00:19:20,277
What awaits you at the
end of that weak hope

317
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:22,910
is an even more tragic death.

318
00:19:22,944 --> 00:19:25,810
Just like Victor
Three, Kazuki Muto,

319
00:19:25,844 --> 00:19:29,210
you're simply engaging
in a futile struggle.

320
00:19:29,244 --> 00:19:32,610
-Don't compare me to that
super naive, optimistic guy.

321
00:19:32,644 --> 00:19:36,977
I really don't care
if he lives or dies.

322
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:40,244
If Tokiko is safe, I
don't care about the rest.

323
00:19:40,277 --> 00:19:42,977
As long as I can protect her.

324
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:45,377
-And if we both want to
protect the same thing,

325
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:48,777
I bet the two of
us can be allies.

326
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:49,477
Damn it.

327
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:51,310
Hey, peeping Tom ninja!

328
00:19:51,344 --> 00:19:52,877
NEGORO: What, droopy eyes?

329
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:56,010
-Tell me, Do you have an ally?

330
00:19:56,044 --> 00:19:56,577
-Hmph.

331
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:57,744
Ridiculous.

332
00:19:57,777 --> 00:20:00,444
Even if I had one, they're
just plain useless.

333
00:20:00,477 --> 00:20:02,910
I am fine on my
own, don't you see?

334
00:20:02,944 --> 00:20:04,744
You may be very good
with your surroundings,

335
00:20:04,777 --> 00:20:08,844
but your reflexes are slower
when you are in motion.

336
00:20:08,877 --> 00:20:10,110
I got you!

337
00:20:10,144 --> 00:20:11,444
-Motor Gears, fire now!

338
00:20:11,477 --> 00:20:11,944
-What?

339
00:20:18,577 --> 00:20:20,110
-You're quite persistent.

340
00:20:20,144 --> 00:20:23,510
But my attack was more
effective than yours.

341
00:20:23,544 --> 00:20:26,444
-Hope you're ready,
because my next move

342
00:20:26,477 --> 00:20:28,710
will spell the end of you.

343
00:20:28,744 --> 00:20:32,177
This piece from your scarf
is what gave you away.

344
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:36,010
Although you said that not
even a speck of dust can enter,

345
00:20:36,044 --> 00:20:39,344
your clothes and your
gear are the exception.

346
00:20:39,377 --> 00:20:44,344
The secret behind that
pathway is not noticeable

347
00:20:44,377 --> 00:20:46,744
when you look at
it at first glance.

348
00:20:46,777 --> 00:20:50,110
Your hair is woven
into the fabric.

349
00:20:50,144 --> 00:20:54,377
Which means the scarf is
recognized as a part of you.

350
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:58,944
The key to the pathway's
passage is your body's DNA.

351
00:20:58,977 --> 00:21:01,144
-Impressive you figured it out.

352
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:02,877
But unfortunately,
just knowing that,

353
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:04,610
you still can't get
into the pathway.

354
00:21:10,544 --> 00:21:11,744
That's--

355
00:21:11,777 --> 00:21:14,677
-My Motor Gear's completely
covered with your blood.

356
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:18,144
You're finished.

357
00:21:18,177 --> 00:21:21,144
[scream]

358
00:21:21,177 --> 00:21:24,177
-Just like you, I'm also
fine fighting on my own.

359
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:33,977
TOKIKO: Gota!

360
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:35,110
Where is he?

361
00:21:35,144 --> 00:21:36,977
Did you defeat him?

362
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:39,477
KAZUKI (VOICEOVER): Since we
want to protect the same thing,

363
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:41,810
I guess for now--

364
00:21:41,844 --> 00:21:43,744
-It was an easy victory.

365
00:21:43,777 --> 00:21:46,644
I bet that fool Kazuki is
all alone and helpless.

366
00:21:46,677 --> 00:21:48,144
So let's hurry up and find him.

367
00:21:50,877 --> 00:21:52,244
[heavy breathing]

368
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:53,844
-Where are they?

369
00:21:53,877 --> 00:21:56,477
I really hope they're
both all right.

370
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:56,977
What's that?

371
00:22:06,677 --> 00:22:07,710
Captain Bravo?

372
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:13,044
-It's time to settle
our score, Kazuki Muto.

373
00:22:23,636 --> 00:22:28,570
[theme music]

374
00:23:55,131 --> 00:23:56,931
TOKIKO: The time has
come to settle things

375
00:23:56,964 --> 00:23:59,364
between two men who
share the same belief.

376
00:23:59,397 --> 00:24:01,697
Protecting the things most
important each of them

377
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:04,064
will thrust them into
a decisive battle.

378
00:24:04,097 --> 00:24:06,731
Next time, With
Strength and Feeling.

379
00:24:06,764 --> 00:24:10,264
I'll splatter your guts!
