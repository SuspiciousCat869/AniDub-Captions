search four days ago,

165
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:47,936
he's obviously taken action and
raised his guard against us.

166
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:49,803
In other words, during
these past four days,

167
00:08:49,836 --> 00:08:51,970
there haven't been any victims.

168
00:08:52,003 --> 00:08:55,103
This is obviously a direct
result of what we're doing.

169
00:08:55,136 --> 00:08:58,303
For now, let's just think about
what we'll do after tomorrow.

170
00:08:58,336 --> 00:09:00,636
You should go home and
get a good night's sleep.

171
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:02,236
You look exhausted.

172
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:03,236
-Right.

173
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:05,336
Then I'll see you tomorrow.

174
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:09,336
Tomorrow we're gonna get the
Creator for sure, Tokiko!

-Tokiko is so
incredible and fierce.

179
00:09:18,136 --> 00:09:19,803
She truly is one
hell of a warrior.

180
00:09:22,503 --> 00:09:25,070
I need to try
harder and catch up.

181
00:09:25,103 --> 00:09:27,736
I know, I should
just ask her what

182
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:31,036
I need to do to master
the Buso Renkin.

183
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:31,770
Tokiko!

-Aiee!

198
00:10:15,436 --> 00:10:18,070
I want to eat her so badly
I can hardly stand it.

199
00:10:18,103 --> 00:10:21,303
The Creator may be interested in
creating an Alchemist Warrior,

200
00:10:21,336 --> 00:10:22,770
but I don't know.

201
00:10:22,803 --> 00:10:24,936
That really isn't
any of my concern.

202
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:27,170
Besides, I wouldn't
be able to eat her

203
00:10:27,203 --> 00:10:28,970
if she became a homunculus.

204
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:31,503
Three days left until
the expiration date.

205
00:10:31,536 --> 00:10:33,403
I've got to eat her up quick.

206
00:10:33,436 --> 00:10:37,836
But I guess it'll have to
be you first, Kazuki Muto.

207
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:40,736
You did kill my little ones
the other night, didn't you?

208
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:42,736
Well, now you're
going to have to pay

209
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:45,903
for that, my friend--
with your life!

210
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:47,336
-Bring it on.

211
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:48,170
-Aiee.

212
00:10:48,203 --> 00:10:51,536
Aren't you a brave little one?

213
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:53,803
-I won't let you
lay a finger on her.

214
00:10:53,836 --> 00:10:56,703
I'll defeat you and make
you talk about the Creator.

215
00:10:56,736 --> 00:10:57,603
-How delusional.

216
00:10:57,636 --> 00:10:59,036
You can't beat me.

217
00:10:59,070 --> 00:10:59,970
Just look at you.

218
00:11:00,003 --> 00:11:01,536
You're a pathetic human.

219
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:02,770
-You don't scare me.

220
00:11:02,803 --> 00:11:04,703
I may be inexperienced,
but I will not

221
00:11:04,736 --> 00:11:06,370
let Tokiko fight tonight.

222
00:11:06,403 --> 00:11:08,303
Besides her, I'm the
only one in this town who

223
00:11:08,336 --> 00:11:11,103
can fight any of you
and I'm not afraid.

224
00:11:11,136 --> 00:11:14,303
-How arrogant.

225
00:11:14,336 --> 00:11:17,070
Well, you both will die anyway.

didn't are you there?

228
00:11:25,506 --> 00:11:26,273
I'm coming in.

229
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:37,201
TOKIKO (VOICEOVER):
He's not here, huh?

230
00:11:37,235 --> 00:11:39,568
Oh well, I'll just leave the
gym clothes he let me borrow.

231
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:47,801
Hm, so this workout is the
reason for his lack of sleep.

232
00:11:47,835 --> 00:11:51,301
Hmm, that's so cute.

233
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:55,835
But he will never master the
Buso Renkin doing it this way.

234
00:11:55,868 --> 00:11:57,668
-Kazuki, look what I got!

235
00:11:57,701 --> 00:11:59,335
Real beauties,
totally your type.

236
00:11:59,368 --> 00:12:02,501
Just like that-- gah,
ya, hee, Tokiko--

237
00:12:02,535 --> 00:12:03,368
-Hmm?

238
00:12:03,401 --> 00:12:04,435
I see.

239
00:12:04,468 --> 00:12:06,635
So Kazuki likes this
kind of stuff, huh?

240
00:12:06,668 --> 00:12:08,635
But I guess this
is yours, though.

241
00:12:08,668 --> 00:12:10,501
You really should
control your perversions.

-Ohh!

I am not a pervert!

-Hey, Tokiko, what
are you doing here.

-Well, I just came to
return something I borrowed.

-Oh.

247
00:12:21,301 --> 00:12:23,183
Then I'll let him know
when he gets back.

-Huh?

249

He hasn't come back yet?

-I don't think so.

for dinner, either.

of town and not one
single soul around.

will to fight is not enough.

The void that separates
homunculus from humans

is much bigger than that.

he may have practiced,
mastering the Buso

298
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:34,049
Renkin is another story.

299

thing waiting for him is death.

Now all I have to do is eat
that girl and I'll get one more.

303
00:14:45,249 --> 00:14:47,783
And maybe once I bring
two pieces of Kakugane

this back to a Kakugane?

KAZUKI (VOICEOVER): What?

309
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:03,316
I'm still alive?

310
00:15:03,349 --> 00:15:07,349
Oh, that's right, my
chest is empty, isn't it?

311
00:15:07,383 --> 00:15:11,583
That means I'm still alive,
even if I've been stabbed.

Ow.

Dying really hurts like hell.

Even though it does
this much, I bet

315
00:15:18,249 --> 00:15:20,449
Tokiko would endure
it and try to hide it.

would do.

No way.

suffer this kind of pain.

that resides in me now is
not just to protect myself.
