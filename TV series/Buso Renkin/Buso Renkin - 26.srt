NARRATOR: The supernatural
alloy produced

00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:18,933
by gathering the essence
of alchemy is the Kakugane.

3
00:00:18,966 --> 00:00:22,866
This device activates upon a
person's fighting instinct,

4
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,466
manifesting the
possessor's inner power

5
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,100
into a tangible form, creating
a weapon like no other.

00:00:30,133 --> 00:00:32,000
Its name, Buso Renkin.

[theme music]

8
00:02:14,302 --> 00:02:16,702
-So what do you want?

9
00:02:16,735 --> 00:02:19,635
Are you on a mission
to eliminate me?

10
00:02:19,668 --> 00:02:21,368
-No, Papillon.

11
00:02:21,402 --> 00:02:25,835
I've come to settle
things-- in Kazuki's place.

12
00:02:25,868 --> 00:02:27,835
-No one could ever
take his place.

13
00:02:27,868 --> 00:02:30,968
Are you saying that Kazuki
Muto is replaceable?

14
00:02:35,535 --> 00:02:37,202
Well, why aren't you answering?

15
00:02:37,235 --> 00:02:39,368
Could someone replace
Kazuki Muto for you?

16
00:02:47,868 --> 00:02:51,302
-Tokiko, where are you?

17
00:02:51,335 --> 00:02:51,835
Look out!

18
00:02:56,835 --> 00:02:58,535
Tokiko!

19
00:02:58,568 --> 00:03:01,535
-Of course, no one
could replace Kazuki.

20
00:03:01,568 --> 00:03:05,468
There is no one in the world
that could ever take his place.

21
00:03:05,502 --> 00:03:06,902
I know that.

22
00:03:06,935 --> 00:03:12,535
But even so, the least I can
do is settle things with you

23
00:03:12,568 --> 00:03:14,835
in his place since he
couldn't do it himself.

24
00:03:19,602 --> 00:03:20,968

-Don't you dare interfere.

36
00:03:51,135 --> 00:03:53,802
-Do you really intend to?

37
00:03:53,835 --> 00:03:55,702
-As I thought before,
maybe it would be best

38
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:58,735
to burn it all down, and then
create a magnificent world that

39
00:03:58,768 --> 00:04:00,568
suits me, and only for me.

40
00:04:00,602 --> 00:04:02,402
-Tell me. do you
really intend to burn

41
00:04:02,435 --> 00:04:03,768
this world to the ground?

42
00:04:03,802 --> 00:04:06,202
-All I have to tell you is,
I have no interest in a world

43
00:04:06,235 --> 00:04:09,368
without Kazuki Muto.

44
00:04:09,402 --> 00:04:11,335
-Koushaku Chouno!

00:04:11,368 --> 00:04:12,835
-How dare you call
me by that name?

Near Death Happiness!

-Hm?

49
00:04:30,035 --> 00:04:31,468
Down there, huh?

50
00:04:39,902 --> 00:04:41,935
-Even if Kazuki
isn't here anymore,

51
00:04:41,968 --> 00:04:44,702
this is still the world he
sacrificed his life to protect!

White Kakugane
creation complete.

55
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:10,402
-Huh?

56
00:05:20,668 --> 00:05:22,768
-You mean that flask was--

57
00:05:22,802 --> 00:05:26,868
-It was built to quickly
create the white Kakugane.

58
00:05:26,902 --> 00:05:30,268
Using Dr. Butterfly and
Dr. Alexandria's technology

59
00:05:30,302 --> 00:05:33,668
as a basis, my master spent
the past month creating it

60
00:05:33,702 --> 00:05:36,502
with every knowledge
and resource available.

61
00:05:36,535 --> 00:05:39,368
My master's only
desire is one thing--

62
00:05:39,402 --> 00:05:42,068
a showdown with Kazuki Muto.

63
00:05:42,102 --> 00:05:46,502
The white Kakugane is
for that purpose alone.

64
00:05:46,535 --> 00:05:50,402
-But Kazuki's not here.

65

PAPILLON: Have you
given up on him?

66
00:05:54,268 --> 00:05:57,768
Have you given up
completely on Kazuki Muto?

67
00:05:57,802 --> 00:05:59,368
Will you give up on him?

68
00:06:11,068 --> 00:06:12,335
-Kazuki.

69
00:06:12,368 --> 00:06:12,835
Kazuki!

70
00:06:26,835 --> 00:06:28,802
-Kazukit Muto.

71
00:06:28,835 --> 00:06:30,602
Hm?

72
00:06:30,635 --> 00:06:32,868
Is that the moonlight?

73
00:06:32,902 --> 00:06:35,302
No!

74
00:06:35,335 --> 00:06:37,768
That's--

75
00:06:37,802 --> 00:06:39,235
-Could that be--

76
00:06:39,268 --> 00:06:39,735
-Wait.

77
00:06:39,768 --> 00:06:40,435
Is that--

78
00:06:40,468 --> 00:06:41,635
-Great Warrior Chief.

79
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:42,502
-It's--

80
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:43,468
BOY: Mahiro!

81
00:06:43,502 --> 00:06:44,402
-Mahiro!

82
00:06:44,435 --> 00:06:45,035
-Mahiro!

83
00:06:45,068 --> 00:06:45,835
-Look at the moon!

84
00:06:45,868 --> 00:06:46,335
Look!

85
00:06:46,368 --> 00:06:47,302
-The moon?

86
00:06:47,335 --> 00:06:47,902
-Outside.

87
00:06:47,935 --> 00:06:50,335
Outside!

88
00:06:50,368 --> 00:07:00,168
TOKIKO: A beautiful, golden,
yellow-- that's-- Kazuki,

89
00:07:00,202 --> 00:07:04,068
did you know that up close, your
Buso Renkin energy is a bright,

90
00:07:04,102 --> 00:07:09,602
golden yellow color, similar
to the rays of the sun?

91
00:07:09,635 --> 00:07:13,568
-Can it be?

92
00:07:13,602 --> 00:07:14,602
-I'll explain later.

93
00:07:14,635 --> 00:07:16,235
Just come with me right now.

94
00:07:16,268 --> 00:07:17,702
-But why are you here?

95
00:07:17,735 --> 00:07:18,268
-Let's go.

96
00:07:18,302 --> 00:07:18,835
Are you ready?

97
00:07:18,868 --> 00:07:19,335
-Go?

98
00:07:19,368 --> 00:07:21,602
Go where?

99
00:07:21,635 --> 00:07:23,468
-Sakimori will take
the right shoulder.

100
00:07:23,502 --> 00:07:25,035
Hiwatari and Busujima,
take the left.

101
00:07:28,502 --> 00:07:30,668
-Great Warrior Chief,
what's going on?

102
00:07:30,702 --> 00:07:33,568
-You have finally arrived.

103
00:07:33,602 --> 00:07:35,068
You're coming with us.

104
00:07:35,102 --> 00:07:36,968
We're planning to recover
Warrior Kazuki Muto.

105
00:07:40,568 --> 00:07:42,435
-Upper hatch release
has been completed.

106
00:07:42,468 --> 00:07:44,202
-Adjusting a mission angle.

107
00:07:44,235 --> 00:07:46,602
-Confirming heat resistance
and air treatment.

108
00:07:46,635 --> 00:07:47,568
-All clear.

109
00:07:47,602 --> 00:07:48,802
Ready for launch.

110
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:49,768
-Very well.

111
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:50,968
Begin launching phase.

112
00:07:51,002 --> 00:07:54,568
BUSUJIMA: Buso Renkin of
Gas Mask, Aerial Operator.

113
00:07:54,602 --> 00:07:57,435
Beginning gas manipulation!

114
00:07:57,468 --> 00:07:59,302
Mixing oxygen.

115
00:07:59,335 --> 00:08:02,702
Injection into rocket pack.

116
00:08:02,735 --> 00:08:04,202
-Blaze of Glory!

117
00:08:04,235 --> 00:08:08,002
Connecting to rocket
pack right now.

118
00:08:08,035 --> 00:08:10,502
-Buster Baron, blast off.

119
00:08:49,502 --> 00:08:51,768
-You still continue to
stand, but the truth

120
00:08:51,802 --> 00:08:55,068
is, this battle has
long been settled.

121
00:08:55,102 --> 00:08:56,002
-No.

122
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,535
Not just yet.

123
00:08:57,568 --> 00:08:58,502
I won't.

124
00:08:58,535 --> 00:09:00,968
I won't give up, no matter what.

125
00:09:03,935 --> 00:09:06,835
Let's finish this, Victor!

126
00:09:06,868 --> 00:09:09,335
I will protect my friends.

127
00:09:16,768 --> 00:09:18,202
And Tokiko too.

128
00:09:18,235 --> 00:09:19,202
No matter what!

129
00:09:29,668 --> 00:09:32,068
I will protect.

130
00:09:32,102 --> 00:09:35,602
I will protect them.

131
00:09:35,635 --> 00:09:36,102
Victor!

132
00:09:40,102 --> 00:09:43,535
-This fight is over.

133
00:09:43,568 --> 00:09:47,068
You must go back to Earth.

134
00:09:47,102 --> 00:09:48,068
Look behind you.

135
00:09:50,935 --> 00:09:52,335
-What is that?

136
00:09:52,368 --> 00:09:54,602
VICTOR: It's your comrades.

137
00:09:54,635 --> 00:10:00,168
They could see that sparkle
of yours from the Earth.

138
00:10:00,202 --> 00:10:01,802
-Victor.

139
00:10:01,835 --> 00:10:06,735
-Over the past month,
they've changed their mind.

140
00:10:06,768 --> 00:10:09,435
They saw that light
and figured out

141
00:10:09,468 --> 00:10:11,802
that you were still
alive out here

142
00:10:11,835 --> 00:10:15,435
and are doing everything
they can to come get you.

143
00:10:15,468 --> 00:10:18,468
That being said, it would be
utterly impossible for those

144
00:10:18,502 --> 00:10:21,768
without bodies like ours
to make it here alive.

145
00:10:21,802 --> 00:10:25,068
You have to go and
meet them halfway.

146
00:10:25,102 --> 00:10:28,168
But in your condition, it's
probably not possible for you

147
00:10:28,202 --> 00:10:32,168
to escape the gravity of
this moon with that lance.

148
00:10:32,202 --> 00:10:34,568
So this is the plan.

149
00:10:34,602 --> 00:10:37,602
I'll use Fatal Attraction to
reverse part of the moon's

150
00:10:37,635 --> 00:10:42,135
gravity and thrust
you into space.

151
00:10:42,168 --> 00:10:43,802
-But Victor, why?

152
00:10:43,835 --> 00:10:45,668
Why are you doing this, Victor?

153
00:10:45,702 --> 00:10:49,902
-Close your mouth, or
you'll bite your tongue.

154
00:10:49,935 --> 00:10:51,702
-Victor, what is this?

155
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:54,135
-The property of
Fatal Attraction

156
00:10:54,168 --> 00:10:57,335
does not have a direct
effect on my body.

157
00:10:57,368 --> 00:10:59,702
And on top of it, I
don't have enough energy

158
00:10:59,735 --> 00:11:02,635
left to propel the
both of off the moon.

159
00:11:02,668 --> 00:11:03,835
Go.

160
00:11:03,868 --> 00:11:08,202
The people you protected
are awaiting your return.

161
00:11:08,235 --> 00:11:09,968
Now go.

162
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:10,902
What are you doing?

163
00:11:10,935 --> 00:11:12,035
-No way!

164
00:11:12,068 --> 00:11:13,402
You're coming, too.

165
00:11:13,435 --> 00:11:15,935
Victoria's waiting for you.

166
00:11:15,968 --> 00:11:18,168
If you don't intend to
fight anymore, then let's

167
00:11:18,202 --> 00:11:21,068
search for a new way to
co-exist together, Victor.

168
00:11:21,102 --> 00:11:23,468
Hurry!

169
00:11:23,502 --> 00:11:24,268
-So be it.

170
00:11:24,302 --> 00:11:25,135
It's your funeral.

171
00:11:27,668 --> 00:11:30,602
VICTOR (VOICEOVER): Under
the same circumstances--

172
00:11:30,635 --> 00:11:31,735
[shout]

173
00:11:31,768 --> 00:11:34,568
VICTOR (VOICEOVER): One
man clung to despair.

174
00:11:34,602 --> 00:11:36,035
[shout]

175
00:11:36,068 --> 00:11:38,502
VICTOR (VOICEOVER): While
another wouldn't give up hope.

176
00:11:42,002 --> 00:11:45,635
There is no way despair
could ever defeat hope.

177
00:11:52,535 --> 00:11:53,902
-Dammit, Shusei.

178
00:11:53,935 --> 00:11:55,668
We're not able to
steadily navigate

179
00:11:55,702 --> 00:11:58,368
this rocket engine we
just whipped together.

180
00:11:58,402 --> 00:12:00,935
-The gas jet's fuel is
already at its limit.

181
00:12:00,968 --> 00:12:01,602
-Hold on.

182
00:12:01,635 --> 00:12:02,702
Everyone, be quiet.

183
00:12:02,735 --> 00:12:06,668
Look up ahead in
front of the moon.

184
00:12:06,702 --> 00:12:07,202
-Wait.

185
00:12:07,235 --> 00:12:08,602
Is that--

186
00:12:08,635 --> 00:12:09,102
-Kazuki!

187
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:18,635
-I can't choose
one or the other!

188
00:12:18,668 --> 00:12:20,702
I will protect us both.

189
00:12:20,735 --> 00:12:22,602
I'll protect everyone.

190
00:12:22,635 --> 00:12:24,868
But who will protect me?

191
00:12:24,902 --> 00:12:26,702
-Kazuki!

192
00:12:26,735 --> 00:12:28,868
SHUSEI: Buster Baron,
approach and acquire.

193
00:12:28,902 --> 00:12:30,768
HIWATARI: That's
easier said than done.

194
00:12:30,802 --> 00:12:32,202
BUSUJIMA: If
something goes wrong,

195
00:12:32,235 --> 00:12:33,835
we could end up killing him.

196
00:12:33,868 --> 00:12:35,668
-This is your mission now.

197
00:12:35,702 --> 00:12:36,735
Bring him home, Tokiko.

198
00:12:44,602 --> 00:12:46,535
TOKIKO: Kazuki.

199
00:12:46,568 --> 00:12:49,035
Kazuki!

200
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:51,502
Kazuki!

201
00:12:51,535 --> 00:12:53,968
Kazuki!

202
00:12:54,002 --> 00:12:56,435
Kazuki!

203
00:12:56,468 --> 00:12:56,935
Kazuki!

204
00:13:00,468 --> 00:13:01,635
KAZUKI: The Silver Skin?

205
00:13:01,668 --> 00:13:04,235
Bravo?

206
00:13:04,268 --> 00:13:06,202
No, it's not.

207
00:13:06,235 --> 00:13:07,202
That's--

208
00:13:07,235 --> 00:13:09,168
-Kazuki!

209
00:13:09,202 --> 00:13:11,635
-Tokiko, it's you!

210
00:13:11,668 --> 00:13:15,568
-When you die,
I'll die with you.

211
00:13:15,602 --> 00:13:16,935
No.

212
00:13:16,968 --> 00:13:20,935
I want to live on with you.

213
00:13:20,968 --> 00:13:22,802
I'll never leave
your side again.

214
00:13:26,435 --> 00:13:30,068
This time for sure.

215
00:13:30,102 --> 00:13:32,035
You and I are one.

216
00:13:58,064 --> 00:13:59,730
BUSUJIMA: Adjusting
atmospheric pressure.

217
00:13:59,764 --> 00:14:01,697
Cooling off heat friction.

218
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:03,697
WOMAN: Buster Baron
landing complete.

219
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:18,997
-Papa?

220
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:23,664
-You OK, Kazuki?

221
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:24,664
-I think so.

222
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:25,797
GOTA (VOICEOVER):
Whatever it takes,

223
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:29,764
I'll do anything, just
to see you smile again.

224
00:14:29,797 --> 00:14:31,364
Just to see you smile again.

225
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:36,597
I'm really happy
for you, Tokiko.

226
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:37,964
-Kazuki!

227
00:14:37,997 --> 00:14:38,497
-Kazuki!

228
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:38,997
-Kazuki!

229
00:14:44,964 --> 00:14:45,930
-Huh?

230
00:14:45,964 --> 00:14:48,797
-So you're back, Kazuki Muto!

231
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:50,697
[coughing]

232
00:14:55,497 --> 00:14:56,397
-Could this be--

233
00:14:59,264 --> 00:15:00,764
-Remember your promise.

234
00:15:00,797 --> 00:15:04,030
You haven't forgotten, have you?

235
00:15:04,064 --> 00:15:04,530
-No.

236
00:15:21,064 --> 00:15:23,864
-Let's settle this
once and for all!

237
00:15:23,897 --> 00:15:24,864
Buso Renkin!

238
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:40,797
[shout]

239
00:15:48,797 --> 00:15:49,264
-Kazuki!

240
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:19,597
-Yah!

241
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:42,964
-Just do it.

242
00:16:42,997 --> 00:16:44,964
And don't mess up this time.

243
00:16:50,664 --> 00:16:52,097
SHUSEI: We made
this by analyzing

244
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:54,197
the device Papillon left behind.

245
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:55,097
Please use this.

246
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:13,030
-Dear Victoria, what
were Alexandria's,

247
00:17:13,064 --> 00:17:15,597
your mother's
final words to you?

248
00:17:18,164 --> 00:17:23,130
ALEXANDRIA (VOICEOVER):
My dear Victoria,

249
00:17:23,164 --> 00:17:25,864
if you should ever
meet your papa,

250
00:17:25,897 --> 00:17:31,130
tell him-- tell him that I
loved him to the very end.

251
00:17:34,297 --> 00:17:39,064
-Great Warrior Chief,
I have a request.

252
00:17:39,097 --> 00:17:42,997
Make me into a Homunculus,
like my daughter.

253
00:17:45,897 --> 00:17:48,964
Homunculi cannot
coexist with humans.

254
00:17:48,997 --> 00:17:52,797
I will take the other Homunculi
and make my way to the moon.

255
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:56,197
We will dream of the day we
can return to being humans,

256
00:17:56,230 --> 00:18:00,830
and pray that the power of
alchemy is never misused again.

257
00:18:00,864 --> 00:18:05,830
Until then, we'll watch
over the earth from afar.

258
00:18:05,864 --> 00:18:07,864
SHUSEI: All Alchemist
Army activities

259
00:18:07,897 --> 00:18:10,297
will be suspended
for the time being.

260
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:12,364
Only the research to
change Homunculi back

261
00:18:12,397 --> 00:18:15,730
into humans and the maintenance
of the Kakugane will continue.

262
00:18:15,764 --> 00:18:18,530
All Warriors will surrender
their Kakugane at once.

263
00:18:21,664 --> 00:18:23,497
-I will remain in the army.

264
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:25,430
This is goodbye.

265
00:18:25,464 --> 00:18:28,597
But I'm warning you, if you
ever make Tokiko cry again--

266
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:29,964
-No, I won't.

267
00:18:29,997 --> 00:18:32,897
Not ever again.

268
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:34,297
-That's good.

269
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:37,664
Then we can always be allies.

270
00:18:37,697 --> 00:18:39,197
-It's time for Jump News.

271
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:40,897
We're bringing you a
special report today

272
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:43,764
on the latest urban legend
since the man-faced dog.

273
00:18:43,797 --> 00:18:47,297
Our story is on the much talked
about butterfly man Papillon.

274
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:48,430
-Papillon?

275
00:18:48,464 --> 00:18:50,897
Yeah, I saw him at the
public bath last month.

276
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:52,197
-Oh, him?

277
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:53,764
I guess he's kind of hard
to forget once you see him.

278
00:18:53,797 --> 00:18:56,364
-Yes, he comes to our
restaurant once a week.

279
00:18:56,397 --> 00:18:58,297
Now we have a butterfly
man promotion going on.

280
00:18:58,330 --> 00:18:59,830
Come see for yourself.

281
00:18:59,864 --> 00:19:02,564
-I hear that if you go on a
roof and call his name out--

282
00:19:02,597 --> 00:19:04,530
-The rumor is he's
likely to show himself.

283
00:19:04,564 --> 00:19:05,764
-Yeah!

284
00:19:05,797 --> 00:19:06,930
All right!

285
00:19:06,964 --> 00:19:08,330
Come on!

286
00:19:08,364 --> 00:19:11,597
-As you can see here in Ginsei,
the legend's place of origin,

287
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:12,364
it's almost like--

288
00:19:12,397 --> 00:19:13,930
-Well, it's hard to explain.

289
00:19:13,964 --> 00:19:15,897
It's like he's
become a local hero.

290
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:19,530
What is the identity of
the butterfly man Papillon?

291
00:19:19,564 --> 00:19:21,930
And what in the world
are his intentions?

292
00:19:26,097 --> 00:19:29,364
-Hey, Chouno, you gotta
tell me right now,

293
00:19:29,397 --> 00:19:31,464
and you have to be honest
with me-- do you still

294
00:19:31,497 --> 00:19:35,564
want to eat people and burn
this world to the ground?

295
00:19:35,597 --> 00:19:38,697
-I'd heard that you didn't
have any urges for cannibalism.

296
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:40,864
I guess it's true, then, huh?

297
00:19:40,897 --> 00:19:43,330
-My master's only
desire is one thing,

298
00:19:43,364 --> 00:19:44,664
a showdown with Kazuki Muto.

299
00:19:48,197 --> 00:19:50,464
-Chouno, there is
no point to this.

300
00:19:50,497 --> 00:19:52,730
I don't want to kill you again.

301
00:19:52,764 --> 00:19:54,730
So I've decided
this is the way I'm

302
00:19:54,764 --> 00:19:58,897
going to settle things with you.

303
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:03,097
Enough with taking
each other's lives.

304
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:06,864
I wish there was a Buso Renkin
to bring people back to life.

305
00:20:06,897 --> 00:20:08,830
But there isn't such a thing.

306
00:20:08,864 --> 00:20:12,630
So let's mourn for the
lives lost, and put an end

307
00:20:12,664 --> 00:20:13,630
to all this.

308
00:20:13,664 --> 00:20:15,230
PAPILLON: You're e
more of a hypocrite

309
00:20:15,264 --> 00:20:18,564
now than you ever were.

310
00:20:18,597 --> 00:20:20,464
-Whatever you say is fine.

311
00:20:20,497 --> 00:20:23,664
It's certainly much better
than me killing you.

312
00:20:23,697 --> 00:20:26,864
Listen, Chouno,
I'll always remember

313
00:20:26,897 --> 00:20:29,597
your name, no matter what.

314
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:32,564
I'll always, always
remember who you are.

315
00:20:32,597 --> 00:20:37,064
So please, take your new name,
and your new life, and live on.

316
00:20:44,864 --> 00:20:46,297
ALL: Papillon!

317
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:47,264
Papillon!

318
00:20:47,297 --> 00:20:49,164
Papillon!

319
00:20:49,197 --> 00:20:50,664
Papillon!

320
00:20:50,697 --> 00:20:52,230
Papillon!

321
00:20:52,264 --> 00:20:53,464
Papillon!

322
00:20:53,497 --> 00:20:56,264
-It's Papillon.

323
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:57,297
Oh, yes!

324
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:59,597
Now put more love into it!

325
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:00,897
ALL: Papillon!

326
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:02,630
Papillon!

327
00:21:02,664 --> 00:21:03,897
Papillon!

328
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,930
Papillon!

329
00:21:05,964 --> 00:21:08,797
KAZUKI: That Chouno's sure
enjoying himself, huh?

330
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:10,230
-How are you doing?

331
00:21:10,264 --> 00:21:11,264
Are you feeling OK?

332
00:21:11,297 --> 00:21:12,764
-Yeah, I'm totally fine.

333
00:21:12,797 --> 00:21:14,664
But are you OK, Tokiko?

334
00:21:14,697 --> 00:21:16,830
You seem kind of fidgety
and restless today.

335
00:21:16,864 --> 00:21:17,797
What's the matter?

336
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:20,430
-Well, the truth
is the Kakugane was

337
00:21:20,464 --> 00:21:22,597
such a big part of
me-- I don't know.

338
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:24,630
I feel like I'm
missing something.

339
00:21:24,664 --> 00:21:27,964
I'm feeling uneasy right now.

340
00:21:27,997 --> 00:21:29,764
-Well, don't worry.

341
00:21:29,797 --> 00:21:32,730
This Kakugane right here will
always be with you, Tokiko.

342
00:21:32,764 --> 00:21:33,230
Forever.

343
00:21:33,264 --> 00:21:34,397
I promise.

344
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:35,564
-Is that right?

345
00:21:35,597 --> 00:21:37,930
Then I'll definitely
feel at easy from now on.

346
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:45,397
TOKIKO (VOICEOVER): We went
from here to a world of battle,

347
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:47,164
and came back again.

348
00:21:47,197 --> 00:21:48,130
-Oh, here they come!

349
00:21:48,164 --> 00:21:49,597
I knew they'd be back!

350
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:51,530
-Kazuki!

351
00:21:51,564 --> 00:21:56,297
[shouting]

352
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:57,297
KAZUKI: Come on, Tokiko.

353
00:22:08,646 --> 00:22:13,046

354
00:23:57,694 --> 00:24:02,894
-Mahiro Muto's Buso
Renkin seminar.

355
00:24:02,928 --> 00:24:03,661
Hello, everyone.

356
00:24:03,694 --> 00:24:05,428
This is Mahiro Muto.

357
00:24:05,461 --> 00:24:08,394
After introducing all
sorts of Buso Renkin,

358
00:24:08,428 --> 00:24:09,961
today is our last one.

359
00:24:09,994 --> 00:24:13,061
So here is a super
duper Buso Renkin

360
00:24:13,094 --> 00:24:16,828
that's a perfect fit
for our final episode.

361
00:24:16,861 --> 00:24:22,128
And our last Buso Renkin
is the Sunlight Heart Plus.

362
00:24:22,161 --> 00:24:26,294
You already know who this
Buso Renkin belongs to, right?

363
00:24:26,328 --> 00:24:28,961
The wielder is-- yep!

364
00:24:28,994 --> 00:24:31,428
My big brother, Kazuki Muto.

365
00:24:31,461 --> 00:24:34,294
The reason his Sunlight
Heart transformed

366
00:24:34,328 --> 00:24:37,494
was because of his Victor-like
form, which he acquired

367
00:24:37,528 --> 00:24:40,061
through the black
Kakugane, so of course

368
00:24:40,094 --> 00:24:42,394
his Sunlight Heart
evolved as well.

369
00:24:42,428 --> 00:24:44,394
It still takes the
form of a lance,

370
00:24:44,428 --> 00:24:47,694
but the size is more
compact than before.

371
00:24:47,728 --> 00:24:50,128
Kazuki told me the weight
is also much lighter,

372
00:24:50,161 --> 00:24:53,328
and can easily be handled
with just one hand.

373
00:24:53,361 --> 00:24:56,028
However, Kazuki's
favorite energy attack

374
00:24:56,061 --> 00:24:57,928
is still as strong as ever.

375
00:24:57,961 --> 00:25:00,294
The Sunlight Heart
Plus is a Buso Renkin

376
00:25:00,328 --> 00:25:02,594
wit built in energy,
and Kazuki is

377
00:25:02,628 --> 00:25:04,594
able to control its
shape and size freely

378
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:06,861
by dismantling the lance tip.

379
00:25:06,894 --> 00:25:08,194
Oh, I see.

380
00:25:08,228 --> 00:25:11,228
So the energy isn't in the
decorative cloth, like before.

381
00:25:11,261 --> 00:25:15,394
But Kazuki's energy that
extends far and beyond

382
00:25:15,428 --> 00:25:19,694
still remains the color of
a beautiful sunlight yellow.

383
00:25:19,728 --> 00:25:20,894
Oh, boy.

384
00:25:20,928 --> 00:25:23,861
I remember back when Kazuki
was becoming a victor,

385
00:25:23,894 --> 00:25:26,361
we were all worried about
what was going to happen.

386
00:25:26,394 --> 00:25:28,361
But thanks to the
white Kakugane,

387
00:25:28,394 --> 00:25:30,061
which can neutralize
the black Kakugane,

388
00:25:30,094 --> 00:25:32,561
he's all back to normal.

389
00:25:32,594 --> 00:25:35,194
Pappy was the one who made
Kazuki's white Kakugane, right?

390
00:25:35,228 --> 00:25:38,194
I should remember to thank
him the next time I see him.

391
00:25:38,228 --> 00:25:40,594
A lot has happened,
but no matter

392
00:25:40,628 --> 00:25:43,594
what, my big brother is still
the big brother I've always

393
00:25:43,628 --> 00:25:47,228
known, ever reliable and
always there for everyone!

394
00:25:47,261 --> 00:25:51,328
But I'm telling you, he'd better
not make Tokiko cry again.

395
00:25:51,361 --> 00:25:54,594
So anyway, everyone's now
totally familiar with the Buso

396
00:25:54,628 --> 00:25:55,428
Renkin, correct?

397
00:25:55,461 --> 00:25:58,194
Then let's say you all graduate.

398
00:25:58,228 --> 00:26:01,561
That makes all of you
Buso Renkin masters.

399
00:26:01,594 --> 00:26:04,494
Thank you for watching
'til now, everyone.

400
00:26:04,528 --> 00:26:07,394
I really hope to see
you all again someday!

401
00:26:07,428 --> 00:26:09,894
Bye, bye, bye!
