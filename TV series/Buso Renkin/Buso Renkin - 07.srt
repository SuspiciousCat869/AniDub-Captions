00:00:14,566 --> 00:00:18,900
by gathering the essence
of alchemy is the Kakugane.

00:00:18,933 --> 00:00:22,866
This device activates upon a
person's fighting instinct,

4
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,466
manifesting the
possessor's inner power

5
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,133
into a tangible form, creating
a weapon like no other.

NESCASTOR: Three days
ago, the residents

9
00:02:10,608 --> 00:02:12,908
of an old family estate
vanished mysteriously.

10
00:02:12,941 --> 00:02:14,508
Officials have no
leads for what seems

11
00:02:14,541 --> 00:02:16,608
to be a modern case of
being spirited away.

12
00:02:16,641 --> 00:02:18,774
In addition, the number of
missing person cases here

13
00:02:18,808 --> 00:02:20,908
in Ginsei City has been
increasing steadily

14
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:22,808
since the beginning
of the-- year!

15
00:02:22,841 --> 00:02:23,308
Hey!

16
00:02:23,341 --> 00:02:23,974
Watch it!

17
00:02:24,008 --> 00:02:24,574
Who are you people?

18
00:02:24,608 --> 00:02:25,208
-Hey, Kazuki!

19
00:02:25,241 --> 00:02:26,008
Are you watchin'?

20
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:34,041
-There are still traces
of your blood here.

21
00:02:37,974 --> 00:02:40,274
10 days ago, you
unwillingly became

22
00:02:40,308 --> 00:02:42,974
involved in the world
of alchemy and combat.

23
00:02:43,008 --> 00:02:45,208
I still can't help but
feel responsible for that.

24
00:02:45,241 --> 00:02:46,874
But you've really
done a good job.

25
00:02:50,774 --> 00:02:52,908
KAZUKI: I haven't
done any good at all.

26
00:02:52,941 --> 00:02:55,108
In the end, I wasn't
able to carry out

27
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:57,874
any of the things I
vowed that I would do.

28
00:02:57,908 --> 00:03:01,341
And what's more, I killed
Chouno with my own hands.

29
00:03:01,374 --> 00:03:04,674
And in the end, he said to me--

30
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:08,341
-Don't apologize, you hypocrite!

31
00:03:08,374 --> 00:03:10,274
-I did the best I could.

32
00:03:10,308 --> 00:03:15,108
But I-- maybe I am a
hypocrite after all.

33
00:03:15,141 --> 00:03:15,608
-Kazuki--

34
00:03:19,974 --> 00:03:23,041
-For good or for evil,
there is no shame

35
00:03:23,074 --> 00:03:26,908
in holding to your beliefs
until the very end.

36
00:03:26,941 --> 00:03:30,008
If you don't know whether
or not you're a hypocrite,

37
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:32,841
then continue
fighting, Kazuki Muto.

38
00:03:32,874 --> 00:03:34,674
-Warrior Chief?

39
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:36,208
-He's the Warrior Chief?

40
00:03:36,241 --> 00:03:38,674
-The next battle
will soon begin.

41
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:40,274
-The next battle?

42
00:03:40,308 --> 00:03:42,241
-Will you continue to fight?

43
00:03:42,274 --> 00:03:46,474
If you're willing, then by
the authority vested in me,

44
00:03:46,508 --> 00:03:49,674
I proclaim you an
Alchemist Warrior.

45
00:04:04,508 --> 00:04:06,341
-Your English
teacher, Mr. Mida, has

46
00:04:06,374 --> 00:04:08,441
been in the hospital
due to illness.

47
00:04:08,474 --> 00:04:11,241
Therefore, starting this week--

48
00:04:11,274 --> 00:04:14,341
-If you don't know whether
or not you're a hypocrite,

49
00:04:14,374 --> 00:04:17,708
then continue
fighting, Kazuki Muto.

50
00:04:17,741 --> 00:04:20,508
TEACHER: Now I will introduce
a new transfer student.

51
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:21,774
Please come in.

[interested chatter]

53
00:04:29,974 --> 00:04:31,141
KAZUKI (VOICEOVER): Tokiko.

54
00:04:31,174 --> 00:04:33,741
-This is Tokiko
Tsumura, and as of today

55
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:35,874
she'll be your new classmate.

56
00:04:35,908 --> 00:04:37,708
BOY: What an awful scar.

57
00:04:37,741 --> 00:04:39,441
It's kind of scary.

58
00:04:39,474 --> 00:04:41,308
BOY: What do you
think happened to her?

59
00:04:41,341 --> 00:04:42,241
TOKIKO (VOICEOVER):
It's the same story

60
00:04:42,274 --> 00:04:43,808
as the last school
I infiltrated.

61
00:04:43,841 --> 00:04:46,508
I'm better off being a loner
than in a place like this.

62
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:48,241
-So, would you like
to introduce yourself?

63
00:04:48,274 --> 00:04:49,341
-I've got nothing to say.

64
00:04:49,374 --> 00:04:49,841
-Huh?

65
00:04:52,408 --> 00:04:54,308
TOKIKO (VOICEOVER): Yes,
it's better this way.

66
00:04:54,341 --> 00:04:58,274
I wouldn't be able to enjoy
a school life now, anyway.

67
00:04:58,308 --> 00:04:59,708
-Um, OK.

68
00:04:59,741 --> 00:05:02,374
So then, does anyone have
any questions for Tokiko?

69
00:05:02,408 --> 00:05:03,574
-Yeah!

70
00:05:03,608 --> 00:05:04,474
-What the hell is your
relationship with Kazuki?

71
00:05:04,508 --> 00:05:05,574
Are you guys going out?

72
00:05:05,608 --> 00:05:07,141
We're all dying to know!

73
00:05:07,174 --> 00:05:07,941
-Yeah!

74
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:08,808
I have a right to know, too!

75
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:10,741
-Mavy, this isn't our class!

76
00:05:10,774 --> 00:05:12,374
-Come on, our class
already started.

77
00:05:12,408 --> 00:05:14,641
GIRL: So you're friends with
the four stooges plus one?

78
00:05:14,674 --> 00:05:17,041
I mean, what kind of
relationship do you guys have?

79
00:05:17,074 --> 00:05:18,874
-Yeah, now we all want to know.

TOKIKO (VOICEOVER):
On second though, this

82
00:05:24,508 --> 00:05:26,774
is a little different
from the last school.

83
00:05:26,808 --> 00:05:29,374
-No questions about my scar
or relationship to Kazuki.

84
00:05:29,408 --> 00:05:30,074
Anyone else?

85
00:05:30,108 --> 00:05:30,908
-When's your birthday?

86
00:05:30,941 --> 00:05:31,874
What's your sign?

87
00:05:31,908 --> 00:05:33,841
-August 7th, which
makes me a Leo.

88
00:05:33,874 --> 00:05:35,108
-So where do you live?

89
00:05:35,141 --> 00:05:36,241
-The dorms, starting today.

90
00:05:36,274 --> 00:05:37,608
-Why aren't you
wear our uniform?

91
00:05:37,641 --> 00:05:39,941
-It flaps around, and it's
hard to move around in it.

92
00:05:39,974 --> 00:05:40,974
-Any hobbies or talents?

93
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:42,308
-Training and changing
clothes quickly.

94
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:43,308
-So what's your type?

95
00:05:43,341 --> 00:05:44,708
-I'm not interested in love.

96
00:05:44,741 --> 00:05:45,974
-Tell them to make me squeal.

97
00:05:46,008 --> 00:05:47,308
-You stupid pig.

98
00:05:47,341 --> 00:05:48,274
Wait a minute!

99
00:05:48,308 --> 00:05:49,141
Who was that?

100
00:05:49,174 --> 00:05:50,441
The last one wasn't a question.

101
00:05:50,474 --> 00:05:51,541
Who was it?

102
00:05:51,574 --> 00:05:54,008
-They're having so much fun.

103
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:56,274
-So just tell us, what
is your relationship?

104
00:05:56,308 --> 00:05:58,408
-Let's just say I'm willing
to keep that secret.

105
00:06:07,874 --> 00:06:09,341
-I'm alive.

106
00:06:09,374 --> 00:06:10,341
-Ah.

107
00:06:10,374 --> 00:06:11,541
You're awake.

108
00:06:11,574 --> 00:06:13,641
Goodmorning, Koushaku.

109
00:06:13,674 --> 00:06:16,274
Or are you now Papillon?

110
00:06:16,308 --> 00:06:17,341
-Who are you?

111
00:06:17,374 --> 00:06:19,541
-I never thought one
of my descendants

112
00:06:19,574 --> 00:06:22,708
would decipher the clues I
left in my research notes

113
00:06:22,741 --> 00:06:27,374
and manage to recreate my
work after a hundred years.

114
00:06:27,408 --> 00:06:29,708
I guess it pays to be immortal.

115
00:06:29,741 --> 00:06:31,541
-Complete the research?

116
00:06:31,574 --> 00:06:33,174
Immortal?

117
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:37,741
My great great grandfather,
Bakushaku Chouno?

118
00:06:37,774 --> 00:06:41,508
-I discarded that name after
I was no longer a human.

119
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:45,874
My brethren in battle now
refer to me as Dr. Butterfly.

120
00:06:45,908 --> 00:06:47,641
Welcome, Papillon.

121
00:06:47,674 --> 00:06:51,174
In acknowledgement of your
superior intellect and ability

122
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:54,274
to take action, I
welcome you to the League

123
00:06:54,308 --> 00:06:57,808
of Extraordinary Elect, the LXE.

124
00:06:57,841 --> 00:07:00,874
First of all, you will need
to restore that body of yours,

125
00:07:00,908 --> 00:07:03,241
and then you shall be
granted the true power

126
00:07:03,274 --> 00:07:05,441
of the humanoid
Homunculus that you still

127
00:07:05,474 --> 00:07:08,174
haven't been able to
successfully achieve.

128
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:11,808
That way you won't be defeated
by mere humans ever again.

129
00:07:11,841 --> 00:07:14,141
-So tell me, how do you feel?

130
00:07:14,174 --> 00:07:16,341
-Magnificent.

131
00:07:16,374 --> 00:07:18,608
KAZUKI: So you think
you're fitting in?

132
00:07:18,641 --> 00:07:19,208
TOKIKO: Yes.

133
00:07:19,241 --> 00:07:20,208
Thanks to you.

134
00:07:20,241 --> 00:07:21,574
KAZUKI: But you're
older than I am,

135
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:25,341
so why are you in
the same class as me?

136
00:07:25,374 --> 00:07:27,341
-Maybe the Warrior Chief
did it for the mission,

137
00:07:27,374 --> 00:07:29,008
to make it easier to execute.

138
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:30,941
But to be honest, it
was actually easier

139
00:07:30,974 --> 00:07:32,908
to function the way
things were before.

140
00:07:32,941 --> 00:07:35,374
I was able to move
around more freely.

141
00:07:35,408 --> 00:07:37,241
-So what's the
Warrior Chief like?

142
00:07:37,274 --> 00:07:39,208
-He's the way you just saw him.

143
00:07:39,241 --> 00:07:42,708
He's very mysterious, and always
hide himself in that coat.

144
00:07:42,741 --> 00:07:45,274
I don't know much about him, not
even his name, or background,

145
00:07:45,308 --> 00:07:47,008
or anything, for that matter.

146
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:48,674
-A man of mystery, huh?

147
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:50,708
Maybe it's just because
it's cooler that way.

148
00:07:50,741 --> 00:07:51,441
-Don't be silly.

149
00:07:51,474 --> 00:07:53,141
That's probably not the reason.

150
00:07:53,174 --> 00:07:56,274
-All I know without a doubt
is that whenever he shows up,

151
00:07:56,308 --> 00:07:58,241
a big battle's about to happen.

152
00:07:58,274 --> 00:08:00,141
The other thing I
can tell you for sure

153
00:08:00,174 --> 00:08:03,408
is that he has a habit of
always saying the word bravo.

154
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:04,808
BRAVO: All right.

155
00:08:04,841 --> 00:08:07,641
So as of today, I'm going to be
the new manager of this dorm.

156
00:08:07,674 --> 00:08:10,074
And you can just call
me Captain Bravo!

157
00:08:10,108 --> 00:08:10,841
-Warrior Chief?

158
00:08:10,874 --> 00:08:12,041
-Um, excuse me?

159
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:14,208
Why don't you just tell
us what your real name is?

160
00:08:14,241 --> 00:08:15,241
-Bravo.

161
00:08:15,274 --> 00:08:17,374
Looks like you're
a smart young lady.

162
00:08:17,408 --> 00:08:20,641
However, my real
name's a secret.

163
00:08:20,674 --> 00:08:23,941
And that's because
it's cooler that way.

164
00:08:23,974 --> 00:08:26,374
-Tokiko, that manager--

165
00:08:26,408 --> 00:08:27,441
-That's right.

166
00:08:27,474 --> 00:08:28,974
I really don't want
to believe it, but--

167
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,208
-The two of us are going
to get along great.

168
00:08:31,241 --> 00:08:33,008
-Are you really that stupid?

169
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:33,941
-Huh?

170
00:08:33,974 --> 00:08:35,141
-Haven't you figured it out?

171
00:08:35,174 --> 00:08:35,774
-What?

172
00:08:35,808 --> 00:08:37,108
-Well, well, well.

173
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:38,674
The fool and the
straight man there

174
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:40,441
with the makeout
strawberry stuff

175
00:08:40,474 --> 00:08:43,374
while someone's taking the
time to introduce themselves.

176
00:08:43,408 --> 00:08:45,174
Report to my office.

177
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:47,741
I'd like a word with
the both of you.

178
00:08:47,774 --> 00:08:48,774
PAPILLON: A story?

179
00:08:48,808 --> 00:08:50,108
DR. BUTTERFLY: Yes.

180
00:08:50,141 --> 00:08:54,941
A story from over 100 years
ago, when I was still human.

181
00:08:54,974 --> 00:08:58,574
Back then, everyone was
already skeptical of alchemy,

182
00:08:58,608 --> 00:08:59,874
and many dismissed it.

183
00:08:59,908 --> 00:09:02,008
But I knew there
was more to it, so I

184
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:05,308
began to completely
immerse myself in research.

185
00:09:05,341 --> 00:09:08,841
Yet, there was only so
much I could do on my own.

186
00:09:08,874 --> 00:09:13,274
I did identify the existence
of Homunculi and Kakugane,

187
00:09:13,308 --> 00:09:15,241
but ended up running
out of leads.

188
00:09:15,274 --> 00:09:18,074
And then he appeared.

189
00:09:18,108 --> 00:09:19,074
-Who?

190
00:09:19,108 --> 00:09:20,074
KAZUKI: A traitor?

191
00:09:20,108 --> 00:09:21,274
-That's right.

192
00:09:21,308 --> 00:09:22,908
100 years ago there
was a man who,

193
00:09:22,941 --> 00:09:24,874
despite being an
alchemist warrior,

194
00:09:24,908 --> 00:09:27,141
turned himself into a
Homunculus and fled.

195
00:09:27,174 --> 00:09:28,974
-Yes, I've heard that before.

196
00:09:29,008 --> 00:09:30,608
As I recall, he was
a strong warrior

197
00:09:30,641 --> 00:09:32,108
who was chased all
the way to Japan,

198
00:09:32,141 --> 00:09:34,041
and was cornered
by his pursuers.

199
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:36,941
Eventually, at the very end
he got away, disappeared,

200
00:09:36,974 --> 00:09:39,141
and has been missing
ever since then.

201
00:09:39,174 --> 00:09:40,008
-Bravo.

202
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:42,174
Great memory, Warriors Tokiko.

203
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:45,708
Now, over a century later,
because of the recent incident

204
00:09:45,741 --> 00:09:49,041
involving Papillon, we now
know about an alchemist

205
00:09:49,074 --> 00:09:51,741
named Bakushaku Chouno.

206
00:09:51,774 --> 00:09:54,174
And we've determined that
he and the Warrior Traitor

207
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:56,041
have joined forces here.

208
00:09:56,074 --> 00:09:59,408
-When I first met him,
he was seriously injured.

209
00:09:59,441 --> 00:10:02,508
So in exchange for his
knowledge of alchemy,

210
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:05,108
I pledged to heal him
once I had finished

211
00:10:05,141 --> 00:10:07,408
conducting my research.

212
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:10,441
It took 100 years,
but it appears

213
00:10:10,474 --> 00:10:12,274
I have finally succeeded.

214
00:10:12,308 --> 00:10:13,708
-I see.

215
00:10:13,741 --> 00:10:16,308
So I'm nothing more
than the guinea pig.

216
00:10:16,341 --> 00:10:20,174
-Remember, he is the
leader of the LXE,

217
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:21,974
and he is the one
who will become

218
00:10:22,008 --> 00:10:25,274
the king of all
Homunculi one day.

219
00:10:25,308 --> 00:10:26,574
-Really?

220
00:10:26,608 --> 00:10:29,208
Then I guess I should vacate
this throne to make room.

221
00:10:29,241 --> 00:10:32,008
Right?

222
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:33,141
-Can this be?

223
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:35,374
The restoration flask's power?

224
00:10:35,408 --> 00:10:36,208
Or is it--

225
00:10:36,241 --> 00:10:38,141
-I have one favor to ask.

226
00:10:38,174 --> 00:10:41,274
I wonder if you'd prepare
some fabulous clothes for me.

227
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:45,508
There's someone I can't
wait to meet again.

228
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:47,508
-The mission this
time around is to get

229
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:50,374
to the bottom of the League
of Extraordinary Elects led

230
00:10:50,408 --> 00:10:53,141
by Dr. Butterfly,
and destroy it.

231
00:10:53,174 --> 00:10:55,074
-Well, the fact that a
name has been confirmed,

232
00:10:55,108 --> 00:10:58,374
it seems the investigation is
already being conducted, sir.

233
00:10:58,408 --> 00:10:59,308
-Yes.

234
00:10:59,341 --> 00:11:00,808
I have already
deployed a warrior

235
00:11:00,841 --> 00:11:03,074
that I brought with
me three days ago.

236
00:11:03,108 --> 00:11:05,474
-So including you and
that warrior, three of us

237
00:11:05,508 --> 00:11:06,674
are assigned to the mission?

238
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:07,508
-No.

239
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,041
We might have to go it alone.

240
00:11:09,074 --> 00:11:11,441
His report stopped
coming two days ago.

241
00:11:11,474 --> 00:11:13,841
Which is why I need to ask you.

242
00:11:13,874 --> 00:11:18,408
Kazuki Muto, will
you join our fight?

243
00:11:18,441 --> 00:11:20,474
It appears that you're
still undecided.

244
00:11:28,274 --> 00:11:29,208
-I don't know.

245
00:11:29,241 --> 00:11:30,641
I'm still torn about
the whole thing.

246
00:11:33,274 --> 00:11:34,841
You see, half of
me wants to keep

247
00:11:34,874 --> 00:11:37,141
fighting those bad guys that
are still out there using

248
00:11:37,174 --> 00:11:39,141
the power of our alchemy.

249
00:11:39,174 --> 00:11:41,641
But the other half of me is
afraid that I'll mess up again,

250
00:11:41,674 --> 00:11:42,608
like I did with Chouno.

251
00:11:42,641 --> 00:11:46,174
[phone ringing]

252
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:48,974
-Honestly, I don't think
you should fight anymore.

253
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:51,541
You really should just leave
the fighting to us warriors,

254
00:11:51,574 --> 00:11:53,441
and go back to your
normal high school life.

255
00:11:53,474 --> 00:11:53,941
BRAVO: Muto!

256
00:11:53,974 --> 00:11:54,508
-Huh?

257
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:55,541
-A phone call.

258
00:11:55,574 --> 00:11:57,308
He says that he's
a friend of yours.

259
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:58,408
-A friend of mine?

260
00:11:58,441 --> 00:11:59,908
I wonder who it is?

261
00:11:59,941 --> 00:12:00,408
Yeah?

262
00:12:00,441 --> 00:12:01,241
Hello?

263
00:12:01,274 --> 00:12:02,608
-Oh, you poor thing.

264
00:12:02,641 --> 00:12:04,374
You sound dispirited.

265
00:12:04,408 --> 00:12:06,841
How strange that I,
the one who lost,

266
00:12:06,874 --> 00:12:08,874
is cheerful, while
you, the one who won,

267
00:12:08,908 --> 00:12:10,774
sound depressed and miserable.

268
00:12:10,808 --> 00:12:12,241
You're worrying me a bit.

269
00:12:12,274 --> 00:12:14,741
How about you and I meet
tomorrow, Kazuki Muto?

270
00:12:14,774 --> 00:12:15,474
-Koushaku Chouno!

271
00:12:28,709 --> 00:12:30,570
[shocked whispers]

272
00:12:30,611 --> 00:12:31,777
-Oh, yoo-hoo.

273
00:12:31,811 --> 00:12:32,573
Over here.

274
00:12:32,607 --> 00:12:34,073
-Koushaku Chouno.

275
00:12:34,107 --> 00:12:36,431
-Why don't we go
inside somewhere,

276
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,764
instead of standing
here talking?

277
00:12:38,797 --> 00:12:41,597
Oh, one hamburger meal A,
and two medium coffees.

278
00:12:41,631 --> 00:12:43,331
Yum.

279
00:12:43,364 --> 00:12:44,097
-Yes, sir.

280
00:12:44,131 --> 00:12:45,631
Will that be for here?

281
00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:47,597
Or maybe you'd like it to go?

282
00:12:47,631 --> 00:12:48,331
-For here.

283
00:12:48,364 --> 00:12:49,664
-Thank you, sir.

284
00:12:49,697 --> 00:12:51,064
Enjoy.

285
00:12:51,097 --> 00:12:51,964
-Just relax.

286
00:12:51,997 --> 00:12:53,331
You don't have to
be so vigilant.

287
00:12:53,364 --> 00:12:55,531
I have no intention
of fighting today.

288
00:12:55,564 --> 00:12:58,164
-Leave the clowning to
your hideous outfit.

289
00:12:58,197 --> 00:12:59,064
-Clowning?

290
00:12:59,097 --> 00:13:00,131
About what?

291
00:13:00,164 --> 00:13:02,131
This outfit of mine
is magnificent.

292
00:13:02,164 --> 00:13:04,864
In fact, it is so marvelous
I could wear it to a ball.

293
00:13:04,897 --> 00:13:06,097
Right, Muto?

294
00:13:06,131 --> 00:13:08,864
-Certainly better than
seeing you in your underwear.

295
00:13:08,897 --> 00:13:09,531
-Underwear?

296
00:13:09,564 --> 00:13:10,531
-Oh, come, now.

297
00:13:10,564 --> 00:13:12,464
I was very fond of
that outfit, too.

298
00:13:12,497 --> 00:13:13,831
It was pretty damn cool.

299
00:13:13,864 --> 00:13:15,997
-Your definition
of cool is way off.

300
00:13:16,031 --> 00:13:17,664
Now, the mask is another story.

301
00:13:17,697 --> 00:13:18,964
That is kind of cool.

302
00:13:18,997 --> 00:13:19,964
-Don't encourage him!

303
00:13:19,997 --> 00:13:21,431
Just take off that mask now.

304
00:13:21,464 --> 00:13:22,731
-That I cannot do.

305
00:13:22,764 --> 00:13:25,564
I'll never take it off in
front of people ever again.

306
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:29,731
It is a testament to me
abandoning my human life.

307
00:13:29,764 --> 00:13:31,831
I had my body
completely restored,

308
00:13:31,864 --> 00:13:34,431
but unfortunately the disease
is still inside of me,

309
00:13:34,464 --> 00:13:35,964
as it was before.

310
00:13:35,997 --> 00:13:38,664
I actually haven't recovered
enough of my physical strength

311
00:13:38,697 --> 00:13:40,064
to fight yet, either.

312
00:13:40,097 --> 00:13:41,564
And apparently I
haven't obtained

313
00:13:41,597 --> 00:13:43,797
the so-called true power.

314
00:13:43,831 --> 00:13:45,297
-True power?

315
00:13:45,331 --> 00:13:48,097
-Muto, you don't seem to
be at your best, either.

316
00:13:48,131 --> 00:13:51,031
So for the time being,
let's just declare war.

317
00:13:51,064 --> 00:13:52,964
We can find when we're
both more prepared.

318
00:13:52,997 --> 00:13:54,397
Something to look forward to.

319
00:13:54,431 --> 00:13:58,364
-In that case, there was no
reason for me to come at all.

320
00:13:58,397 --> 00:13:59,197
-Huh?

321
00:13:59,231 --> 00:14:00,197
-Captain Bravo?

322
00:14:00,231 --> 00:14:01,397
-Warrior Chief?

323
00:14:01,431 --> 00:14:04,597
-Miss, I too shall have
a hamburger meal A!

324
00:14:04,631 --> 00:14:07,031
-Are you going to want
that for here, sir?

325
00:14:07,064 --> 00:14:08,931
Or will that be to go, instead?

326
00:14:08,964 --> 00:14:09,964
-For here.

327
00:14:09,997 --> 00:14:11,364
-Manager!

328
00:14:11,397 --> 00:14:14,464
-This one is on the house, so
please just take it to go, sir.

329
00:14:14,497 --> 00:14:15,797
-What wonderful service.

330
00:14:15,831 --> 00:14:16,897
Bravo!

331
00:14:16,931 --> 00:14:19,231
I think I'll start
coming here all the time!

332
00:14:19,264 --> 00:14:19,997
PAPILLON: Me, too.

333
00:14:20,031 --> 00:14:21,831
This place is magnificent.

334
00:14:21,864 --> 00:14:23,431
[doorbell]

335
00:14:27,431 --> 00:14:28,531
-Mm.

336
00:14:28,564 --> 00:14:31,631
The flavor of blood is
absolutely delicious.

337
00:14:31,664 --> 00:14:34,364
-That's the taste of the
blood you coughed up.

338
00:14:34,397 --> 00:14:35,631
-So that was it, huh?

339
00:14:35,664 --> 00:14:36,964
I guess that's all right.

340
00:14:36,997 --> 00:14:38,331
Hm.

341
00:14:38,364 --> 00:14:40,531
I wonder how many years it's
been since I've been to school?

342
00:14:40,564 --> 00:14:41,664
-Serve the ball!

343
00:14:41,697 --> 00:14:43,197
-Here it comes!

344
00:14:43,231 --> 00:14:44,064
Eat this!

345
00:14:44,097 --> 00:14:45,331
-What, dodgeball?

346
00:14:45,364 --> 00:14:48,297
-But things haven't
really changed at all.

347
00:14:48,331 --> 00:14:50,997
No matter whose
voice I hear, it only

348
00:14:51,031 --> 00:14:54,131
sounds like people mocking me.

349
00:14:54,164 --> 00:14:57,164
Even after having been
reborn as a superhuman,

350
00:14:57,197 --> 00:14:59,697
it seems the world
hasn't changed at all.

351
00:14:59,731 --> 00:15:01,664
As I thought before,
maybe it would be best

352
00:15:01,697 --> 00:15:04,664
to burn it all down, and then
create a magnificent world that

353
00:15:04,697 --> 00:15:08,731
suits me, and is only for me.

354
00:15:08,764 --> 00:15:12,731
-So the LXE doesn't satisfy
you enough, Koushaku Chouno?

355
00:15:12,764 --> 00:15:15,431
-I've had enough seclusion
in the past, you see.

356
00:15:15,464 --> 00:15:19,197
And by the way, don't you ever
dare call me Chouno again.

357
00:15:19,231 --> 00:15:23,197
Only Kazuki Muto may
call me by that name.

358
00:15:23,231 --> 00:15:25,831
Muto, I'm not quite sure
why you're not yourself,

359
00:15:25,864 --> 00:15:28,297
and the truth is I don't care.

360
00:15:28,331 --> 00:15:31,764
Eventually I'll settle things
with you once and for all.

361
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:35,497
Until I do, I won't be able to
be myself, and truly take off.

362
00:15:35,531 --> 00:15:36,131
KAZUKI: Chouno.

363
00:15:38,964 --> 00:15:41,931
I also plan to settle things
with you once and for all.

364
00:15:41,964 --> 00:15:42,764
-Good.

365
00:15:42,797 --> 00:15:44,464
Your fighting spirit's returned.

366
00:15:44,497 --> 00:15:47,497
That makes me kind of happy.

367
00:15:47,531 --> 00:15:50,497
-Do you know what you're
getting into, Kazuki?

368
00:15:50,531 --> 00:15:53,064
Settling things means
killing him one more time.

369
00:15:53,097 --> 00:15:55,064
Do you really think
you can do that?

370
00:15:55,097 --> 00:15:56,431
Can you kill him again?

371
00:16:02,664 --> 00:16:04,097
-Sorry to interrupt.

372
00:16:04,131 --> 00:16:07,064
However, it appears
something urgent has come up.

373
00:16:07,097 --> 00:16:08,431
Another enemy.

374
00:16:08,464 --> 00:16:11,031
But unlike Papillon, this one
seems to possess true power.

375
00:16:13,864 --> 00:16:15,464
MOONFACE: Moon?

376
00:16:15,497 --> 00:16:17,597
-The experiment is a success.

377
00:16:17,631 --> 00:16:19,564
-So we'll finally
be able to heal him?

378
00:16:19,597 --> 00:16:22,064
-It'll have to be done
after the maintenance,

379
00:16:22,097 --> 00:16:24,731
so we won't be able
to do it right away.

380
00:16:24,764 --> 00:16:25,931
-I just can't wait.

381
00:16:25,964 --> 00:16:27,831
By the way, what about Papillon?

382
00:16:27,864 --> 00:16:30,264
-He couldn't wait to go
out in the elegant suit I

383
00:16:30,297 --> 00:16:31,531
prepared for him.

384
00:16:31,564 --> 00:16:33,831
He went to settle some
unfinished business

385
00:16:33,864 --> 00:16:34,997
with a warrior.

386
00:16:35,031 --> 00:16:36,697
Probably an
associative of the one

387
00:16:36,731 --> 00:16:38,431
we took care of the other day.

388
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:39,131
MOONFACE: Oh, my.

389
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:40,197
Will he be all right?

390
00:16:40,231 --> 00:16:42,197
-There won't be any problems.

391
00:16:42,231 --> 00:16:46,231
I sent Kinjo to
keep an eye on him.

392
00:16:46,264 --> 00:16:46,931
-Homunculus!

393
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,331
-Buso--

394
00:16:48,364 --> 00:16:48,831
-Renkin!

395
00:16:54,897 --> 00:16:59,531
Buso Renkin of the Right Hand
Gauntlet, Peaky Gulliver!

396
00:16:59,564 --> 00:17:02,097
-The difference between a
humanoid and an animal type

397
00:17:02,131 --> 00:17:04,664
isn't just what they eat,
or that the humanoid has

398
00:17:04,697 --> 00:17:08,064
superior power while
maintaining its human form.

399
00:17:08,097 --> 00:17:10,197
No matter how much human
knowledge an animal type

400
00:17:10,231 --> 00:17:12,597
acquires, it can only
fight instinctively

401
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:14,597
with its claws and fangs.

402
00:17:14,631 --> 00:17:17,764
A humanoid can fight with a
command of various weapons,

403
00:17:17,797 --> 00:17:19,964
using their own
fighting instincts.

404
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:21,364
In other words--

405
00:17:21,397 --> 00:17:25,064
-They're able to use Kakugane as
a Buso Renkin, just like we do.

406
00:17:25,097 --> 00:17:28,297
-So this is the true power
of the humanoid Homunculi?

407
00:17:28,331 --> 00:17:30,697
-I'll deal with you
little weaklings later.

408
00:17:30,731 --> 00:17:32,097
Hey, you in the coat!

409
00:17:32,131 --> 00:17:33,297
I'll start with you first!

410
00:17:35,864 --> 00:17:39,097
Homunculus power which exceeds
humans, and Buso Renkin

411
00:17:39,131 --> 00:17:41,164
power exceeding
all modern science!

412
00:17:41,197 --> 00:17:44,331
Do you really think you can beat
the most powerful combination

413
00:17:44,364 --> 00:17:47,531
of these two elements with
your single Buso Renkin alone?

414
00:17:47,564 --> 00:17:49,031
-We can, and we will.

415
00:17:49,064 --> 00:17:51,897
That is why we Alchemist
Warriors exist.

416
00:17:51,931 --> 00:17:52,431
-Buso Renkin!

417
00:17:55,597 --> 00:17:58,664
Buso Renkin of the
Lance, Sunlight Heart!

418
00:17:58,697 --> 00:17:59,931
Energy full blast!

419
00:17:59,964 --> 00:18:02,764
Go now!

420
00:18:02,797 --> 00:18:06,364
-I said that I would deal with
you little weaklings later!

421
00:18:06,397 --> 00:18:08,431
-Jousting renamed
to Sunlight Slasher!

422
00:18:16,064 --> 00:18:17,964
His fist suddenly got huge.

423
00:18:17,997 --> 00:18:19,497
-Why are you so surprised?

424
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:20,531
You should know better.

425
00:18:20,564 --> 00:18:23,097
A Buso Renkin is
no ordinary weapon.

426
00:18:23,131 --> 00:18:25,731
This is the special property
of my Peaky Gulliver!

427
00:18:25,764 --> 00:18:26,831
Yahoo!

428
00:18:26,864 --> 00:18:30,097
-You lousy-- All right,
I'll burst through

429
00:18:30,131 --> 00:18:31,297
with the Sunlight Slasher!

430
00:18:31,331 --> 00:18:32,664
-You wish.

431
00:18:32,697 --> 00:18:34,531
Laputa Falls!

432
00:18:34,564 --> 00:18:36,397
No way will a
Homunculus ever lose

433
00:18:36,431 --> 00:18:39,731
to a mere human
in a power match.

434
00:18:39,764 --> 00:18:40,231
-Kazuki!

435
00:18:47,097 --> 00:18:48,997
Are you all right, Kazuki?

436
00:18:49,031 --> 00:18:49,964
-Yeah, I'm fine.

437
00:18:49,997 --> 00:18:51,797
But this guy is tough.

438
00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:52,864
-I know that.

439
00:18:52,897 --> 00:18:54,631
Buso--

440
00:18:54,664 --> 00:18:56,131
-You two stay back.

441
00:18:56,164 --> 00:18:57,231
I'll deal with him.

442
00:18:57,264 --> 00:18:58,364
-Warrior Chief.

443
00:18:58,397 --> 00:19:00,997
-This guy's a small fry,
but he's more than you

444
00:19:01,031 --> 00:19:02,464
two can handle right now.

445
00:19:02,497 --> 00:19:02,997
-Me?

446
00:19:03,031 --> 00:19:04,164
A small fry?

447
00:19:04,197 --> 00:19:06,231
What a lousy judge of enemies.

448
00:19:06,264 --> 00:19:11,097
-As I recall, that Kakugane
had the serial number 52.

449
00:19:11,131 --> 00:19:12,464
-You got good eyes.

450
00:19:12,497 --> 00:19:15,364
It's been three days, but I
got the all clear from Moonface

451
00:19:15,397 --> 00:19:18,231
to use this weapon he got
from the Warrior he defeated.

452
00:19:18,264 --> 00:19:20,931
By any chance, was he
one of your subordinates?

453
00:19:20,964 --> 00:19:22,531
I'm sensing something here.

454
00:19:22,564 --> 00:19:26,664
Are you suddenly blind with
anger, Mr. Alchemist Warrior?

455
00:19:26,697 --> 00:19:27,497
-No.

456
00:19:27,531 --> 00:19:29,331
A Warrior's defeat means death.

457
00:19:29,364 --> 00:19:30,897
I'm not angry about that.

458
00:19:30,931 --> 00:19:32,664
-Wow, that's pretty darn cold.

459
00:19:32,697 --> 00:19:33,764
Well, here goes.

460
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:35,231
Brobdingnag Knuckles!

461
00:19:39,597 --> 00:19:40,564
What's this?

462
00:19:40,597 --> 00:19:42,264
It's like steel.

463
00:19:42,297 --> 00:19:43,131
This is not possible.

464
00:19:43,164 --> 00:19:44,364
No way.

465
00:19:44,397 --> 00:19:46,297
-Buso Renkin of
the Metal Jacket.

466
00:19:46,331 --> 00:19:48,364
Silver Skin.

467
00:19:48,397 --> 00:19:50,964
The service both turns into
hard metal and regenerates

468
00:19:50,997 --> 00:19:53,231
instantly when
something strikes it.

469
00:19:53,264 --> 00:19:55,797
You think I wear this outfit
because I like how it looks?

470
00:19:55,831 --> 00:19:56,631
-Uh.

471
00:19:56,664 --> 00:19:57,964
-Not bad at all.

472
00:19:57,997 --> 00:19:59,997
But it's just a
defense Buso Renkin.

473
00:20:00,031 --> 00:20:00,731
Not a real weapon.

474
00:20:00,764 --> 00:20:05,831
So, Finger Strike!

475
00:20:05,864 --> 00:20:07,797
-But I do have a weapon.

476
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:09,731
My Warrior body is my weapon.

477
00:20:18,997 --> 00:20:22,831
-You-- You are angry
after all, aren't you?

478
00:20:22,864 --> 00:20:24,531
-I told you already.

479
00:20:24,564 --> 00:20:28,064
I'm not angry at all.

480
00:20:28,097 --> 00:20:28,564
-Wow.

481
00:20:28,597 --> 00:20:29,531
So strong.

482
00:20:29,564 --> 00:20:30,031
What?

483
00:20:36,997 --> 00:20:39,231
KAZUKI (VOICEOVER):
Bravo really isn't angry.

484
00:20:39,264 --> 00:20:41,297
He looked like he was
about to cry at any moment.

485
00:20:44,731 --> 00:20:45,664
-Bravo.

486
00:20:45,697 --> 00:20:46,697
Tokiko.

487
00:20:46,731 --> 00:20:47,964
OK, I'll do it.

488
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:50,464
If we allow the LXE
to continue to exist,

489
00:20:50,497 --> 00:20:52,631
this town will go to pieces.

490
00:20:52,664 --> 00:20:56,497
Somebody's gotta fight them
now, so that Mahiro, my friends,

491
00:20:56,531 --> 00:21:00,997
and all the people in school
and in town can live in peace.

492
00:21:01,031 --> 00:21:02,731
Being called a hypocrite.

493
00:21:02,764 --> 00:21:05,197
Feeling the pain
of my own shame.

494
00:21:05,231 --> 00:21:06,831
I think I can live with it.

495
00:21:06,864 --> 00:21:08,464
I think I can bear
it if I want to help

496
00:21:08,497 --> 00:21:10,897
free people from
suffering and sadness.

497
00:21:10,931 --> 00:21:12,064
I've decided.

498
00:21:12,097 --> 00:21:15,664
I'll keep fighting as
long as we need to.

499
00:21:15,697 --> 00:21:16,831
Captain Bravo.

500
00:21:16,864 --> 00:21:19,231
Please make me into
an Alchemist Warrior.

501
00:21:19,264 --> 00:21:20,697
-Kazuki Muto.

502
00:21:20,731 --> 00:21:24,164
You can't always rely on
your Buso Renkin alone.

503
00:21:24,197 --> 00:21:27,364
If you keep on fighting the way
you have been all this time,

504
00:21:27,397 --> 00:21:32,031
you'll never win, and
you'll get yourself killed.

505
00:21:32,064 --> 00:21:34,297
In order to make you into
an Alchemist Warrior,

506
00:21:34,331 --> 00:21:36,664
I'll train you without mercy.

507
00:21:36,697 --> 00:21:38,564
If you don't want to
perish, sink your teeth

508
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:39,731
in with a do or die resolve.

509
00:21:39,764 --> 00:21:41,031
Got it?

510
00:21:41,064 --> 00:21:41,531
-Hm.

511
00:21:53,183 --> 00:21:56,150
[theme music]

512
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:25,317
TOKIKO (VOICEOVER):
Another enemy

513
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:27,950
has shown up targeting
the perfect place to feed.

514
00:23:27,983 --> 00:23:29,683
The school dorm.

515
00:23:29,717 --> 00:23:32,550
Never again will I let
that tragedy repeat itself.

516
00:23:32,583 --> 00:23:34,817
I'll kill that
Homunculus for sure!

517
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:37,050
Next time, A Night in the Dorm.

518
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:40,583
I'll splatter your guts!
