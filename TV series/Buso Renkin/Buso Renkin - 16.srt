NARRATOR: The supernatural
alloy produced

2
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:18,866
by gathering the essence
of alchemy is the kakugane.

3
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,866
This device activates upon a
person's fighting instinct,

4
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,433
manifesting the
possessor's inner power

5
00:00:25,466 --> 00:00:30,100
into a tangible form,
creating a weapon like other.

6
00:00:30,133 --> 00:00:35,100
Its name, Buso Renkin.

00:02:09,841 --> 00:02:11,907
NARRATOR: The decisive
battle with the League

9
00:02:11,941 --> 00:02:15,941
of Extraordinary Elects or
L.X.E. has come to an end.

10
00:02:15,974 --> 00:02:19,007
However, Victor has
been resurrected.

11
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:21,041
In the course of this
battle with Victor,

12
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:24,641
Kazuki himself has transformed
into a form similar

13
00:02:24,674 --> 00:02:25,841
to Victor's.

14
00:02:25,874 --> 00:02:28,707
With Victor's flight,
the mission is completed.

15
00:02:28,741 --> 00:02:30,974
Kazuki and the others
have gone to the beach

16
00:02:31,007 --> 00:02:32,541
for a brief vacation.

17
00:02:32,574 --> 00:02:33,707
But--

18
00:02:33,741 --> 00:02:36,374
-You don't want to involve
the others, now, do you?

19
00:02:36,407 --> 00:02:38,841
Why don't we take our time
to talk it over tonight?

20
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:47,074
-There's no place
like the beach.

21
00:02:47,107 --> 00:02:49,007
[laughs]

22
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:50,907
-An octopus!

23
00:02:50,941 --> 00:02:52,341
-Whoa.

24
00:02:52,374 --> 00:02:53,274
-Yeah!

25
00:02:53,307 --> 00:02:54,707
-Yeah.

26
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:55,774
-Yah!

27
00:02:55,807 --> 00:02:58,674
I I told you to quit
staring at my naval.

28
00:02:58,707 --> 00:03:00,474
-Bravo!

29
00:03:00,507 --> 00:03:01,941
Yeah, bravo!

30
00:03:09,907 --> 00:03:12,574
-Hey Rokumasu, where
did Okakura go?

31
00:03:12,607 --> 00:03:16,107
-Well, I'm not quite sure,
but I think I might know.

32
00:03:16,141 --> 00:03:17,241
-Hey, ladies.

33
00:03:17,274 --> 00:03:18,307
Want to get a drink?

34
00:03:18,341 --> 00:03:19,174
[giggling]

35
00:03:19,207 --> 00:03:22,141
-What a funny face.

36
00:03:22,174 --> 00:03:23,041
-Hey.

37
00:03:23,074 --> 00:03:24,941
Hey there.

38
00:03:24,974 --> 00:03:28,074
-I hate the beach
with a passion.

39
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:29,941
-Hey, what's with Okakura?

40
00:03:29,974 --> 00:03:32,841
-Well, I'm not quite sure,
but I think I might know.

41
00:03:35,707 --> 00:03:36,607
-Bravo?

42
00:03:36,641 --> 00:03:37,607
-Bravo.

43
00:03:37,641 --> 00:03:38,841
Don't be discouraged.

44
00:03:38,874 --> 00:03:40,574
Some things are more
rewarding in the end

45
00:03:40,607 --> 00:03:42,107
when you keep on trying.

46
00:03:42,141 --> 00:03:44,774
Maybe I should just demonstrate
to make things easier.

47
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:46,674
Hello, ladies.

48
00:03:46,707 --> 00:03:47,807
Watch closely now.

49
00:03:47,841 --> 00:03:48,541
Here goes.

50
00:03:48,574 --> 00:03:50,141
Bravo Arts 1 of 13!

51
00:03:50,174 --> 00:03:50,974
-Warrior chief.

52
00:03:51,007 --> 00:03:53,474
-The enchanting Bravo Kiss.

53
00:03:56,441 --> 00:03:57,574
-What was--

54
00:03:57,607 --> 00:04:00,541
-For a moment there
I felt kind of funny.

55
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:01,641
-What do you think?

56
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:05,207
-Master, please, take
me under your wing.

57
00:04:05,241 --> 00:04:08,507
-Enchanting Kazuki Kiss.

58
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:12,274
-You ever do that again and
I'll splatter your guts.

59
00:04:12,307 --> 00:04:13,174
-Got it.

60
00:04:13,207 --> 00:04:14,874
-By the way, I'm
the only one who

61
00:04:14,907 --> 00:04:18,141
can use this technique, because
it's one of a kind Bravo art.

62
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:21,307
-That's not fair.

63
00:04:21,341 --> 00:04:23,541
-All right, let's go
to clean up for dinner,

64
00:04:23,574 --> 00:04:25,674
and then we'll shoot some
fireworks around nine.

65
00:04:25,707 --> 00:04:26,207
-Roger.

66
00:04:26,241 --> 00:04:27,607
-Got it.

67
00:04:27,641 --> 00:04:29,707
-So about your belly
button, Tokiko.

68
00:04:29,741 --> 00:04:32,674
-What is it with the two
of you and belly buttons?

69
00:04:32,707 --> 00:04:34,474
-So tell me,
Kazuki, did anything

70
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:36,807
happen while I was gone?

71
00:04:36,841 --> 00:04:38,741
-Well, Let's see.

72
00:04:38,774 --> 00:04:41,574
Nobody from the L.X.E.
Came looking for us.

73
00:04:41,607 --> 00:04:45,274
Chono hasn't shown himself
even once since then.

74
00:04:45,307 --> 00:04:46,774
So nothing happened, I guess.

75
00:04:46,807 --> 00:04:48,574
We've had nothing but peace.

76
00:04:48,607 --> 00:04:50,774
-That's very good to hear.

77
00:04:50,807 --> 00:04:54,374
-By the way, Bravo,
once things settle down,

78
00:04:54,407 --> 00:04:58,507
will you continue
training me like before?

79
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:01,241
I'm no match for
Victor like this.

80
00:05:01,274 --> 00:05:03,274
And if I'd been
stronger then, maybe I

81
00:05:03,307 --> 00:05:07,074
would have been able to
prevent Victor's restoration.

82
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:09,974
I'm still not strong enough.

83
00:05:10,007 --> 00:05:13,974
I want to become a stronger
alchemist warrior, Bravo.

84
00:05:14,007 --> 00:05:15,307
-200.

85
00:05:15,341 --> 00:05:17,107
Oh, my back is killing me.

86
00:05:17,141 --> 00:05:19,041
-Hey, Kazuki, let's
do rock paper scissors

87
00:05:19,074 --> 00:05:20,641
to see who carries
the bags next.

88
00:05:20,674 --> 00:05:21,407
-Coming.

89
00:05:21,441 --> 00:05:22,807
-Kazuki.

90
00:05:22,841 --> 00:05:25,974
Tonight after midnight meet me
over at the rocks to the west.

91
00:05:29,941 --> 00:05:32,107
-Let's eat!

92
00:05:32,141 --> 00:05:34,941
-Everything looks so good.

93
00:05:34,974 --> 00:05:36,974
Touch my food, you die.

94
00:05:37,007 --> 00:05:38,907
All right, then I'm
going to take yours.

95
00:05:38,941 --> 00:05:41,407
-Over my dead body.

96
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:43,841
-Hey, knock it off, Rokumasu.

97
00:05:43,874 --> 00:05:46,841
My food!

98
00:05:46,874 --> 00:05:48,407
-What's wrong, Tokiko?

99
00:05:48,441 --> 00:05:48,941
-Huh?

100
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:49,974
Oh, nothing.

101
00:05:50,007 --> 00:05:51,507
-You haven't touched
your food at all.

102
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:53,174
Did you lose your
appetite or something?

103
00:05:53,207 --> 00:05:54,074
-Oh, no.

104
00:05:54,107 --> 00:05:55,474
It's not that at all.

105
00:05:55,507 --> 00:06:02,041
-Well in that case, get ready to
eat plenty of food, all right?

106
00:06:02,074 --> 00:06:03,974
-Well, uh, I guess so.

107
00:06:08,941 --> 00:06:18,974
[laughter]

108
00:06:18,974 --> 00:06:24,241
[laughter]

109
00:06:24,274 --> 00:06:25,207
-Hey, wait!

110
00:06:29,674 --> 00:06:35,374
[snoring]

111
00:06:49,007 --> 00:06:49,941
-Hey, Bravo.

112
00:06:57,274 --> 00:06:58,407
Wait a sec.

113
00:06:58,441 --> 00:07:00,741
Bravo, where's Tokiko?

114
00:07:00,774 --> 00:07:04,474
-Sorry to keep you
waiting, Gota Nakamura.

115
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:05,841
-You remembered me, huh?

116
00:07:05,874 --> 00:07:07,941
That's so nice of you.

117
00:07:07,974 --> 00:07:08,674
-Buso Renkin.

118
00:07:13,374 --> 00:07:14,774
Tell me.

119
00:07:14,807 --> 00:07:16,274
Why are you here?

120
00:07:16,307 --> 00:07:18,107
-Already bearing your fangs?

121
00:07:18,141 --> 00:07:21,407
You really are quite
the warrior, aren't you?

122
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:24,007
I've got to say, that happens
to be one of your best traits,

123
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:25,241
Tokiko.

124
00:07:25,274 --> 00:07:27,941
Thanks for your support
with my training back then.

125
00:07:27,974 --> 00:07:32,474
As of now, I'm officially
an alchemist warrior, just

126
00:07:32,507 --> 00:07:34,174
like you, Tokiko.

127
00:07:34,207 --> 00:07:35,407
-Skip the pleasantries.

128
00:07:35,441 --> 00:07:37,774
Hurry and explain
why you are here.

129
00:07:37,807 --> 00:07:39,474
-Hey, that's pretty cold.

130
00:07:39,507 --> 00:07:42,107
But that too is one of the
great things about you.

131
00:07:42,141 --> 00:07:45,674
-So what did you
call me out here for?

132
00:07:45,707 --> 00:07:48,941
-I'm here to deliver your new
assignment from headquarters.

133
00:07:48,974 --> 00:07:51,274
It's the same mission that
I've been assigned to.

134
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:55,841
-I wonder if she got lost.

135
00:07:55,874 --> 00:07:59,541
-Kazuki, how much of you
heard from Warrior Tokiko

136
00:07:59,574 --> 00:08:01,674
about the main
purpose of our forces?

137
00:08:01,707 --> 00:08:02,207
-How much?

138
00:08:02,241 --> 00:08:03,207
Well, let's see.

139
00:08:03,241 --> 00:08:04,774
Just that it
safeguards the kakugane

140
00:08:04,807 --> 00:08:06,807
and defeats the
Homunculi, but you know,

141
00:08:06,841 --> 00:08:09,474
actually I haven't
been told its name yet.

142
00:08:09,507 --> 00:08:10,874
-I see.

143
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:13,441
Well then, I'll
start from there.

144
00:08:13,474 --> 00:08:16,174
The organization that
binds us alchemist warriors

145
00:08:16,207 --> 00:08:20,274
together is called
the Alchemist Army.

146
00:08:20,307 --> 00:08:22,674
-The Alchemist Army?

147
00:08:22,707 --> 00:08:24,941
-It all started with
the alchemist guilds

148
00:08:24,974 --> 00:08:26,807
of medieval England.

149
00:08:26,841 --> 00:08:29,874
Over the years it has grown
into a secret society governing

150
00:08:29,907 --> 00:08:32,141
every aspect of alchemy.

151
00:08:32,174 --> 00:08:35,174
It has three main purposes.

152
00:08:35,207 --> 00:08:38,774
Two of them you already
know, but there is one more.

153
00:08:38,807 --> 00:08:41,674
The creation of the
philosopher's stone.

154
00:08:41,707 --> 00:08:44,107
Even those who are not
really familiar with alchemy

155
00:08:44,141 --> 00:08:45,874
have heard of it before.

156
00:08:45,907 --> 00:08:48,007
It is the transmutation
of base metals

157
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:52,474
into precious metals, the quest
for attaining immortality.

158
00:08:52,507 --> 00:08:55,474
This all powerful stone
represents that crystallization

159
00:08:55,507 --> 00:08:58,974
of all alchemy, making
all miracles possible.

160
00:08:59,007 --> 00:09:00,874
After many long
years of research,

161
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:04,807
the Alchemist Army had a
breakthrough 100 years ago.

162
00:09:04,841 --> 00:09:08,041
They used the kakugane with
serial numbers one, two,

163
00:09:08,074 --> 00:09:10,207
and three to create
three prototypes.

164
00:09:10,241 --> 00:09:11,907
And those became--

165
00:09:11,941 --> 00:09:13,907
-The black kakugane.

166
00:09:13,941 --> 00:09:15,107
-Correct.

167
00:09:15,141 --> 00:09:17,841
And the first person to be
chosen as a test subject

168
00:09:17,874 --> 00:09:21,674
was great warrior Victor.

169
00:09:21,707 --> 00:09:24,007
In a fierce battle
with the Homunculi,

170
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:26,174
Victor's heart was
severely damaged.

171
00:09:26,207 --> 00:09:28,841
In order to save his
life, he Alchemist Army

172
00:09:28,874 --> 00:09:31,807
replaced it right away with
the prototype black kakugane

173
00:09:31,841 --> 00:09:33,607
serial number one.

174
00:09:33,641 --> 00:09:35,974
The result, as you
know, was that Victor

175
00:09:36,007 --> 00:09:39,341
changed into a monster even
greater than the Homunculi.

176
00:09:39,374 --> 00:09:41,507
And for the time,
the Alchemist Army

177
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:44,174
was driven to the
brink of destruction.

178
00:09:44,207 --> 00:09:47,407
Amidst the chaos,
several kakugane,

179
00:09:47,441 --> 00:09:50,207
including the remaining
two black kakugane,

180
00:09:50,241 --> 00:09:53,807
found their way into
the outside world.

181
00:09:53,841 --> 00:09:57,541
Since then, all research
on the philosopher's stone

182
00:09:57,574 --> 00:10:00,074
has been indefinitely suspended.

183
00:10:00,107 --> 00:10:02,041
-What about the story of
Victor turning himself

184
00:10:02,074 --> 00:10:04,307
into a Homunculus and
becoming a traitor?

185
00:10:04,341 --> 00:10:08,374
-Well, that was a cover up
story to hide the organization's

186
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:09,074
greatest failure.

187
00:10:12,007 --> 00:10:13,807
The reason warrior
Tokiko implanted

188
00:10:13,841 --> 00:10:18,041
the kakugane in your chest was
because the story she heard

189
00:10:18,074 --> 00:10:21,241
about Victor's
transplant was incorrect.

190
00:10:21,274 --> 00:10:24,374
It has taken me an entire
month to really dig and uncover

191
00:10:24,407 --> 00:10:27,741
this information about Victor
and the black kakugane.

192
00:10:27,774 --> 00:10:29,741
And it took me another
month to investigate

193
00:10:29,774 --> 00:10:31,307
both you and your
condition, Kazuki.

194
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:35,407
When you were at
our hospital, you

195
00:10:35,441 --> 00:10:38,274
underwent an extensive
physical exam.

196
00:10:38,307 --> 00:10:40,807
After carefully
analyzing those results

197
00:10:40,841 --> 00:10:43,307
and studying records of what
transpired with your Victor

198
00:10:43,341 --> 00:10:46,207
form, all findings
confirm that your body

199
00:10:46,241 --> 00:10:48,674
and the black kakugane
have become linked

200
00:10:48,707 --> 00:10:51,641
and can no longer be
separated from one another.

201
00:10:51,674 --> 00:10:55,707
In other words, you will never
be able to be human again.

202
00:11:03,707 --> 00:11:06,307
OK what are you
talking about, Bravo?

203
00:11:06,341 --> 00:11:07,507
I mean, really, look at me.

204
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:10,174
I think I look pretty
human right now.

205
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:12,574
-One doesn't become
like Victor all at once.

206
00:11:12,607 --> 00:11:13,907
There are stages.

207
00:11:13,941 --> 00:11:16,141
And you are still at stage one.

208
00:11:16,174 --> 00:11:19,141
If my calculations are
correct, your transformation

209
00:11:19,174 --> 00:11:21,607
will be complete
in about six weeks.

210
00:11:21,641 --> 00:11:23,041
By the end of the
summer, you will

211
00:11:23,074 --> 00:11:26,574
be just like Victor, a monster
whose mere existence brings

212
00:11:26,607 --> 00:11:28,941
death and destruction
to all around it.

213
00:11:28,974 --> 00:11:31,407
Before that happens you
must be disposed of.

214
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:35,641
That is my new mission.

215
00:11:35,674 --> 00:11:37,507
-Bravo.

216
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:39,707
-You were killed
by a Homunculus.

217
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:41,974
The life that Warrior
Tokiko gave you

218
00:11:42,007 --> 00:11:44,207
should never have
been given to anyone.

219
00:11:44,241 --> 00:11:48,274
You must be killed once
again to set things right.

220
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:49,307
-Bravo!

221
00:11:49,341 --> 00:11:50,874
-Kazuki Muto must
be re-exterminated.

222
00:11:58,643 --> 00:12:00,043
-What did you just say?

223
00:12:00,076 --> 00:12:02,443
Explain what you
just said to me.

224
00:12:02,476 --> 00:12:04,743
Are you telling me you're
here to kill Kazuki?

225
00:12:07,343 --> 00:12:07,876
-No.

226
00:12:07,909 --> 00:12:09,043
Of course not.

227
00:12:09,076 --> 00:12:11,109
They don't give this
kind of job to rookies.

228
00:12:11,143 --> 00:12:14,876
I'm just supposed to keep you
here until the job is done.

229
00:12:14,909 --> 00:12:17,409
However, I could
take this guy Kazuki

230
00:12:17,443 --> 00:12:19,409
if I were given a fair chance.

231
00:12:19,443 --> 00:12:21,109
-If not you then who?

232
00:12:21,143 --> 00:12:22,509
Who could it be?

233
00:12:22,543 --> 00:12:24,243
Someone at this beach?

234
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:25,176
Some other warrior?

235
00:12:28,376 --> 00:12:29,776
It can't be.

236
00:12:34,443 --> 00:12:36,176
Where are they now?

237
00:12:36,209 --> 00:12:37,409
-I cannot tell you.

238
00:12:37,443 --> 00:12:40,043
A warrior's mission
is a sacred duty.

239
00:12:40,076 --> 00:12:40,976
-You're right.

240
00:12:41,009 --> 00:12:41,809
I'll search myself.

241
00:12:56,076 --> 00:12:57,809
-Five kilometers east of here.

242
00:12:57,843 --> 00:12:59,176
Deep into the craggy area.

243
00:13:02,143 --> 00:13:04,576
-Thank you, Gota.

244
00:13:04,609 --> 00:13:06,043
I owe you one.

245
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:08,376
I'm happy you achieved your
wish of becoming a warrior.

246
00:13:08,409 --> 00:13:09,043
Congratulations.

247
00:13:12,009 --> 00:13:15,009
-When she's not acting tough,
she's not so bad either.

248
00:13:15,043 --> 00:13:16,976
Oh no, what did I just do?

249
00:13:17,009 --> 00:13:18,209
You mustn't, Tokiko.

250
00:13:18,243 --> 00:13:19,843
It's too dangerous to go now.

251
00:13:19,876 --> 00:13:21,343
Captain Bravo means business.

252
00:13:26,609 --> 00:13:27,943
-Say it isn't so, Bravo.

253
00:13:31,543 --> 00:13:33,043
Please tell me you're
kidding, Bravo.

254
00:13:33,076 --> 00:13:36,043
Just say it.

255
00:13:36,076 --> 00:13:37,643
It's a lie!

256
00:13:37,676 --> 00:13:39,476
Lie, lie, lie, lie!

257
00:13:39,509 --> 00:13:42,576
You are lying!

258
00:13:42,609 --> 00:13:46,409
-For good or for evil,
there is no shame

259
00:13:46,443 --> 00:13:50,943
in holding to your beliefs
until the very end.

260
00:13:50,976 --> 00:13:53,776
-The same words he used when
he recruited me as a warrior.

261
00:13:53,809 --> 00:13:56,809
-My mission is to save
as many people as I can.

262
00:13:56,843 --> 00:13:59,743
And to do that, I'm even willing
to kill a fellow warrior if I

263
00:13:59,776 --> 00:14:01,309
need to.

264
00:14:01,343 --> 00:14:04,509
I would even become evil itself.

265
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,509
-So it's true.

266
00:14:06,543 --> 00:14:11,509
The man standing before me
really is Captain Bravo.

267
00:14:11,543 --> 00:14:14,243
-Now, will you lay down
your life willingly?

268
00:14:17,043 --> 00:14:17,509
Kazuki.

269
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:23,376
-I understand.

270
00:14:23,409 --> 00:14:25,209
But not now.

271
00:14:25,243 --> 00:14:26,276
I won't give up just yet.

272
00:14:26,309 --> 00:14:27,409
I can't.

273
00:14:27,443 --> 00:14:29,109
Don't you see that those
are the same words that

274
00:14:29,143 --> 00:14:31,209
encouraged me to become
an alchemist warrior,

275
00:14:31,243 --> 00:14:33,276
believing in my own
convictions like you?

276
00:14:33,309 --> 00:14:36,343
If six weeks is all I have
left as a human being,

277
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:40,143
then I'm going to pursue my
convictions to the very end.

278
00:14:40,176 --> 00:14:45,043
And I will fight until then
with the life Tokiko's given me.

279
00:14:45,076 --> 00:14:48,076
I will.

280
00:14:48,109 --> 00:14:52,076
-Kazuki, you really
have grown strong.

281
00:14:52,109 --> 00:14:56,876
-That's why I intend to fight.

282
00:15:00,209 --> 00:15:01,176
Buso Renkin!

283
00:15:20,076 --> 00:15:22,243
Something's wrong with
the sunlight heart.

284
00:15:22,276 --> 00:15:23,743
Could it be there's
still some damage

285
00:15:23,776 --> 00:15:25,143
left from the
battle with Victor?

286
00:15:28,176 --> 00:15:30,009
What's this?

287
00:15:30,043 --> 00:15:33,876
-Just like Victor's battle
records from a century ago.

288
00:15:33,909 --> 00:15:36,309
You yourself have
already changed,

289
00:15:36,343 --> 00:15:39,809
so your Buso Renkin
is changing with you.

290
00:15:39,843 --> 00:15:42,276
Kazuki will get even stronger.

291
00:15:42,309 --> 00:15:44,009
That is why I must
finish him off

292
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:46,343
before he becomes
even more powerful.

293
00:15:46,376 --> 00:15:47,343
-What is this?

294
00:15:47,376 --> 00:15:48,776
The sunlight heart
is changing form.

295
00:15:54,909 --> 00:15:56,409
Wait, is this?

296
00:15:56,443 --> 00:15:58,109
Could this possibly
be my new lance?

297
00:16:00,909 --> 00:16:01,709
-Yes.

298
00:16:01,743 --> 00:16:02,809
That is your new strength.

299
00:16:05,609 --> 00:16:07,143
Take it in your hand.

300
00:16:07,176 --> 00:16:08,243
Show me its power.

301
00:16:13,676 --> 00:16:15,843
-It's smaller and
lighter than before

302
00:16:15,876 --> 00:16:18,076
and I can wield it
easily with one hand.

303
00:16:18,109 --> 00:16:21,976
Now I can execute everything
I've learned thus far.

304
00:16:22,009 --> 00:16:24,843
But.

305
00:16:24,876 --> 00:16:27,676
-Its reach has become
that much shorter,

306
00:16:27,709 --> 00:16:30,509
and its destructive power
has also been reduced.

307
00:16:30,543 --> 00:16:32,543
He's missing his mark even
when he aims correctly.

308
00:16:32,576 --> 00:16:35,843
The lance will fail as a
weapon if it lacks the power

309
00:16:35,876 --> 00:16:37,309
to kill with a single blow.

310
00:16:37,343 --> 00:16:37,809
-Come on.

311
00:16:37,843 --> 00:16:39,276
Reach him.

312
00:16:39,309 --> 00:16:42,543
Reach him, please!

313
00:16:42,576 --> 00:16:43,043
-What?

314
00:16:46,043 --> 00:16:47,509
Slash bravo chop.

315
00:16:51,476 --> 00:16:52,943
-It's already begun.

316
00:16:52,976 --> 00:16:54,176
-Wait for me, Tokiko.

317
00:16:54,209 --> 00:16:54,909
Wait, Tokiko!

318
00:17:00,876 --> 00:17:02,109
-I see.

319
00:17:02,143 --> 00:17:05,009
This new lance is the
eternal energy type.

320
00:17:05,043 --> 00:17:07,776
It has the special feature
of activating and expanding

321
00:17:07,809 --> 00:17:09,709
as needed.

322
00:17:09,743 --> 00:17:12,009
It is a good lance.

323
00:17:12,043 --> 00:17:13,909
Its size and power
can be adjusted

324
00:17:13,943 --> 00:17:15,909
to suit the needs of a battle.

325
00:17:15,943 --> 00:17:18,776
However, with your
new Buso Renkin

326
00:17:18,809 --> 00:17:22,176
alone, you can't possibly
beat by silver skin or me.

327
00:17:25,143 --> 00:17:28,043
-I already knew that he was
strong, but he's really strong.

328
00:17:31,309 --> 00:17:33,943
-Come at me with
everything you've got.

329
00:17:33,976 --> 00:17:36,243
The warrior chief
commands a domain

330
00:17:36,276 --> 00:17:39,376
far superior to anything
you have ever imagined.

331
00:17:39,409 --> 00:17:42,009
If you want to see the smiles
of your friends, your sister

332
00:17:42,043 --> 00:17:44,109
and Warrior Tokiko
once again, then you'd

333
00:17:44,143 --> 00:17:48,476
better fight me with
everything you've got.

334
00:17:48,509 --> 00:17:49,476
-All right.

335
00:17:54,443 --> 00:17:57,876
Here I come, Bravo.

336
00:17:57,909 --> 00:18:01,576
I'll repel the silver
skin to end this battle.

337
00:18:01,609 --> 00:18:04,309
-So this is the power
of the black kakugane.

338
00:18:04,343 --> 00:18:06,743
But ultimately the man
who must be defeated

339
00:18:06,776 --> 00:18:09,076
has powers far
greater than this.

340
00:18:09,109 --> 00:18:11,009
If I cannot prevail
against Kazuki now,

341
00:18:11,043 --> 00:18:12,576
how will I ever defeat Victor?

342
00:18:19,309 --> 00:18:20,243
-I've crushed it!

343
00:18:20,276 --> 00:18:22,643
I'll use this to--

344
00:18:22,676 --> 00:18:26,409
-You'll use this to do what?

345
00:18:26,443 --> 00:18:29,076
Silver Skin, another type.

346
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:31,676
I have taken your
most powerful attack

347
00:18:31,709 --> 00:18:34,676
and I too shall give you in
return everything I've got.

348
00:18:34,709 --> 00:18:36,909
Here I come.

349
00:18:36,943 --> 00:18:38,743
-What?

350
00:18:38,776 --> 00:18:40,276
-Silver Skin, reverse.

351
00:18:44,276 --> 00:18:45,443
-Silver Skin reverse?

352
00:18:51,376 --> 00:18:52,309
What the?

353
00:18:56,309 --> 00:18:57,276
Again.

354
00:18:57,309 --> 00:18:58,943
I can't move my fist.

355
00:18:58,976 --> 00:19:00,376
-Not just your fist.

356
00:19:00,409 --> 00:19:03,609
You'll find that your
entire body is paralyzed.

357
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:07,076
That is the power of
Silver Skin reverse.

358
00:19:07,109 --> 00:19:09,809
The regular Silver Skin
is a powerful metal jacket

359
00:19:09,843 --> 00:19:12,876
that completely blocks out
attacks from the outside.

360
00:19:12,909 --> 00:19:15,243
But if it is reversed,
its characteristics

361
00:19:15,276 --> 00:19:18,476
are inverted, preventing an
enemy from releasing an attack.

362
00:19:18,509 --> 00:19:20,409
It becomes an
invisible straitjacket

363
00:19:20,443 --> 00:19:23,076
averting all offensive
action by the attacker.

364
00:19:23,109 --> 00:19:27,676
Of course, it does not only
shut out physical attacks.

365
00:19:27,709 --> 00:19:31,109
It seems to recognize your
energy drain as an attack

366
00:19:31,143 --> 00:19:33,576
as well.

367
00:19:33,609 --> 00:19:35,509
This battle is over.

368
00:19:35,543 --> 00:19:36,776
Surrender, Kazuki.

369
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:38,543
It's not too late.

370
00:19:38,576 --> 00:19:41,509
If you do so now, you can
still die as a human being.

371
00:19:44,443 --> 00:19:44,909
-No.

372
00:19:44,943 --> 00:19:45,876
Not yet.

373
00:19:54,843 --> 00:19:57,343
Those smiles.

374
00:19:57,376 --> 00:19:59,276
I'm not ready to give them up.

375
00:20:06,876 --> 00:20:12,209
-Another type of reverse, also
known as the double straight.

376
00:20:12,243 --> 00:20:14,543
Farewell to do, Kazuki Muto.

377
00:20:18,476 --> 00:20:19,909
-Bravo.

378
00:20:19,943 --> 00:20:20,376
No.

379
00:20:29,176 --> 00:20:31,043
[inaudible]

380
00:20:31,076 --> 00:20:32,543
Okakura.

381
00:20:32,576 --> 00:20:34,043
Everyone.

382
00:20:34,076 --> 00:20:34,543
Tokiko.

383
00:20:54,409 --> 00:20:54,876
-Kazuki!

384
00:20:57,709 --> 00:20:59,576
-Warrior Tokiko, halt.

385
00:20:59,609 --> 00:21:00,776
That's an order.

386
00:21:00,809 --> 00:21:02,309
-I cannot listen to that order.

387
00:21:05,076 --> 00:21:07,476
-Don't forget that
you're a warrior.

388
00:21:07,509 --> 00:21:08,609
Go and cool your head.

389
00:21:11,409 --> 00:21:13,376
-Tokiko!

390
00:21:13,409 --> 00:21:14,309
-Warrior Gota.

391
00:21:14,343 --> 00:21:15,143
-Forgive me.

392
00:21:22,243 --> 00:21:28,476
[phone ringing]

393
00:21:28,509 --> 00:21:33,109
-Has Kazuki Muto been properly
re-exterminated, Sakimori?

394
00:21:33,143 --> 00:21:33,609
-Hewatari.

395
00:21:41,809 --> 00:21:42,409
-Tokiko.

396
00:21:42,443 --> 00:21:43,276
Are you all right?

397
00:21:43,309 --> 00:21:43,776
-Kazuki!

398
00:21:43,809 --> 00:21:44,709
Let go.

399
00:21:44,743 --> 00:21:46,043
If I don't help
him soon he will--

400
00:21:46,076 --> 00:21:46,943
-What are you saying?

401
00:21:46,976 --> 00:21:47,643
Just calm down.

402
00:21:47,676 --> 00:21:48,276
It's hopeless.

403
00:21:48,309 --> 00:21:49,543
He's already dead.

404
00:21:49,576 --> 00:21:51,143
Besides, with your
legs in that shape,

405
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:53,276
it's not possible for
you to swim on your own.

406
00:21:53,309 --> 00:21:53,876
-I don't care.

407
00:21:53,909 --> 00:21:54,943
Let go.

408
00:21:54,976 --> 00:21:56,109
Where are you, Kazuki?

409
00:21:56,143 --> 00:21:57,343
Kazuki!

410
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:59,376
-Give up on him, Tokiko.

411
00:21:59,409 --> 00:22:01,876
There's no way Captain Bravo
would leave unfinished business

412
00:22:01,909 --> 00:22:03,276
behind when he's
given a mission.

413
00:22:06,076 --> 00:22:07,843
The re-extermination
has been completed.

414
00:22:12,276 --> 00:22:14,176
-Kazuki.

415
00:22:14,209 --> 00:22:14,676
Kazuki!

416
00:22:23,664 --> 00:22:25,530
[music playing]

417
00:23:54,297 --> 00:23:56,330
-I will not leave your side.

418
00:23:56,364 --> 00:23:58,464
As long as there's
a shred of hope,

419
00:23:58,497 --> 00:24:01,097
I won't give up
until the very end.

420
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:03,964
The moment you die,
I will die too.

421
00:24:03,997 --> 00:24:07,497
Next time, When Dawn Comes,
I'll splatter your guts.
