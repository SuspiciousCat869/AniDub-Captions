NARRATOR: The supernatural
alloy produced

2
00:00:14,974 --> 00:00:19,374
by gathering the essence
of alchemy is the Kakugane.

3
00:00:19,407 --> 00:00:23,074
This device activates upon a
person's fighting instinct,

4
00:00:23,107 --> 00:00:28,007
manifesting the possessor's
inner power into tangible form,

5
00:00:28,041 --> 00:00:30,874
creating a weapon like no other.

6
00:00:30,907 --> 00:00:32,841
Its name, Buso Renkin.

00:00:36,441 --> 00:00:40,907
[theme music]

8
00:02:08,697 --> 00:02:11,231
NARRATOR: An obscure antidote
is the only hope for Tokiko

9
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:14,997
to remove the parasite
Homunculus nesting in her body.

10
00:02:15,031 --> 00:02:17,331
Kazuki goes to find
Chouno, the only person who

11
00:02:17,364 --> 00:02:21,131
can provide this, but Kazuki
has sustained serious injuries,

12
00:02:21,164 --> 00:02:23,097
and his stamina
has been drained.

13
00:02:23,131 --> 00:02:25,264
To assist his healing
process, Tokiko

14
00:02:25,297 --> 00:02:27,964
entrusts him with
her own Kakugane.

15
00:02:27,997 --> 00:02:29,764
-I'll be back, Tokiko.

16
00:02:29,797 --> 00:02:33,764
Everyone, just wait for me.

17
00:02:33,797 --> 00:02:37,197
[heavy breathing]

18
00:02:42,731 --> 00:02:46,031
KAZUKI (VOICEOVER): This
must be Chouno's house.

19
00:02:46,064 --> 00:02:47,631
What you mean, you don't know?

20
00:02:47,664 --> 00:02:49,064
-It's been a long
time, and I don't

21
00:02:49,097 --> 00:02:50,964
care to know of his whereabouts.

22
00:02:50,997 --> 00:02:52,031
-But that's--

23
00:02:52,064 --> 00:02:53,964
-It was my intention
that he would eventually

24
00:02:53,997 --> 00:02:56,031
inherit the Chouno
family fortune.

25
00:02:56,064 --> 00:02:57,797
I gave him every
conceivable kind

26
00:02:57,831 --> 00:03:01,364
of education for the gifted, and
it all seemed to be paying off.

27
00:03:01,397 --> 00:03:02,964
People around us
would speak of how

28
00:03:02,997 --> 00:03:04,331
he was following
in the footsteps

29
00:03:04,364 --> 00:03:06,097
of his great, great
grandfather, who

30
00:03:06,131 --> 00:03:08,064
laid the foundation
for this family.

31
00:03:08,097 --> 00:03:09,697
But now look at him.

32
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:14,497
A 19-year-old recluse who
repeats the same year twice.

33
00:03:14,531 --> 00:03:14,997
-Chouno!

34
00:03:18,931 --> 00:03:20,464
-What do you want
with Master Jiro?

35
00:03:20,497 --> 00:03:21,997
-J-Jiro?

36
00:03:22,031 --> 00:03:24,531
-Big brother is missing, huh?

37
00:03:24,564 --> 00:03:26,464
How amusing.

38
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:27,897
-Chouno's younger brother?

39
00:03:27,931 --> 00:03:30,331
-If you find him,
give him this message.

40
00:03:30,364 --> 00:03:32,664
It has been decided that
Jiro will be the family's

41
00:03:32,697 --> 00:03:35,797
sole successor, and that he
is no longer needed here.

42
00:03:35,831 --> 00:03:37,831
-Are you serious?

43
00:03:37,864 --> 00:03:40,164
Your Chouno's
father, aren't you?

44
00:03:40,197 --> 00:03:43,397
He's suffering from
a terrible disease.

45
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:45,164
-What of it?

46
00:03:45,197 --> 00:03:47,297
If he isn't able to
carry out his purpose,

47
00:03:47,331 --> 00:03:50,497
then he is of no use to me.

48
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:51,764
MAN: Get lost, kid.

49
00:04:01,464 --> 00:04:05,364
[phone ringing]

50
00:04:05,397 --> 00:04:06,331
MAHIRO: Yes, hello?

51
00:04:06,364 --> 00:04:07,797
Oh, hi Kazuki.

52
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:09,097
Tokiko?

53
00:04:09,131 --> 00:04:09,664
Yeah!

54
00:04:09,697 --> 00:04:10,964
Oh, don't worry.

55
00:04:10,997 --> 00:04:11,964
She's just fine.

56
00:04:11,997 --> 00:04:14,764
I swear by nightingale,
I, nurse Mahiro,

57
00:04:14,797 --> 00:04:16,631
will make sure to
look after her.

58
00:04:16,664 --> 00:04:17,964
DAIHAMA: Is that her own outfit?

59
00:04:17,997 --> 00:04:19,964
OKAKURA: Don't tell me she
has a thing for uniforms.

60
00:04:19,997 --> 00:04:21,431
ROKUMASU: Well, the
truth is, you're

61
00:04:21,464 --> 00:04:24,531
more like a caretaker
than an actual nurse.

62
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:27,464
-Stop interrupting, or I'm
gonna give all you guys shots!

63
00:04:27,497 --> 00:04:29,897
-So Chouno didn't go to
his family home, huh?

64
00:04:29,931 --> 00:04:31,831
Well, do you think
there's a possibility

65
00:04:31,864 --> 00:04:33,597
that his father might be lying?

66
00:04:33,631 --> 00:04:35,131
KAZUKI (ON PHONE): Not a chance.

67
00:04:35,164 --> 00:04:38,431
If I were Chouno, there's no
way I'd go back there either.

68
00:04:38,464 --> 00:04:40,564
He clearly isn't
welcome there at all.

69
00:04:40,597 --> 00:04:43,564
-Then that means the only place
that he would return to is

70
00:04:43,597 --> 00:04:45,597
where it all began for him.

71
00:04:45,631 --> 00:04:47,531
It's gotta be.

72
00:04:47,564 --> 00:04:48,197
-Got it.

73
00:04:48,231 --> 00:04:49,397
I'll keep looking.

74
00:04:49,431 --> 00:04:50,631
TOKIKO: Stop running.

75
00:04:50,664 --> 00:04:53,231
If you overdo it, you'll
collapse for sure this time.

76
00:04:53,264 --> 00:04:54,597
-I'm fine.

77
00:04:54,631 --> 00:04:55,697
So far

78
00:04:55,731 --> 00:04:56,331
TOKIKO: So far?

79
00:05:05,631 --> 00:05:08,431
-Only three and a
half hours left.

80
00:05:08,464 --> 00:05:13,197
Come to think of it, I haven't
eaten anything since yesterday.

81
00:05:13,231 --> 00:05:17,364
Once I've become a
Homunculus, I'll have to eat.

82
00:05:17,397 --> 00:05:19,731
I wonder what would be good?

83
00:05:19,764 --> 00:05:21,297
I guess it'll have to be humans?

84
00:05:27,331 --> 00:05:29,931
-I've finally found you, Chouno.

85
00:05:29,964 --> 00:05:30,997
-Ah, yes.

86
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:31,664
You're Muto.

87
00:05:36,997 --> 00:05:37,697
-Chouno!

88
00:05:37,731 --> 00:05:38,197
-Muto!

89
00:05:40,831 --> 00:05:41,997
TOKIKO: What's wrong, Kazuki?

90
00:05:42,031 --> 00:05:44,797
What was that loud
noise just now?

91
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:46,797
Did you get excited and
collapse, or something?

92
00:05:46,831 --> 00:05:47,564
You're kidding me.

93
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:48,864
Didn't I warn you?

94
00:05:48,897 --> 00:05:51,464
-You look so energetic
all of a sudden.

95
00:05:51,497 --> 00:05:52,897
-I found him, Tokiko.

96
00:05:52,931 --> 00:05:55,164
Just as you predicted.

97
00:05:55,197 --> 00:05:58,297
His source of emotional
support is the alchemy research

98
00:05:58,331 --> 00:06:01,264
his great, great
grandfather left behind.

99
00:06:01,297 --> 00:06:03,297
His last resort
was the warehouse

100
00:06:03,331 --> 00:06:04,697
where he discovered
that research.

101
00:06:07,264 --> 00:06:09,731
-Then Washio must've
been defeated.

102
00:06:09,764 --> 00:06:11,297
Otherwise you wouldn't be alive.

103
00:06:11,331 --> 00:06:12,664
-That's right.

104
00:06:12,697 --> 00:06:14,197
And he was worried
about you right up

105
00:06:14,231 --> 00:06:15,797
until he took his last breath.

106
00:06:15,831 --> 00:06:16,531
-So what?

107
00:06:16,564 --> 00:06:17,964
Who cares?

108
00:06:17,997 --> 00:06:20,231
If he can't carry
out his function,

109
00:06:20,264 --> 00:06:22,264
then he is of no use to me.

110
00:06:22,297 --> 00:06:25,064
-The antidote and the
Homunculus embryo--

111
00:06:25,097 --> 00:06:26,631
give them to me, Chouno.

112
00:06:26,664 --> 00:06:28,297
-I'll give you the antidote.

113
00:06:28,331 --> 00:06:30,231
But I can't give you this.

114
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:33,464
If I don't have this, I'll
soon die from this disease.

115
00:06:33,497 --> 00:06:36,897
KAZUKI: I cannot let you
become a Homunculus like this.

116
00:06:36,931 --> 00:06:41,231
I promised myself I wouldn't
allow anymore sacrifices.

117
00:06:41,264 --> 00:06:43,331
TOKIKO: No use trying
to talk to him, Kazuki.

118
00:06:43,364 --> 00:06:45,931
He won't listen to
anyone right now.

119
00:06:45,964 --> 00:06:48,931
Grab the Homunculus embryo
and get out of there quickly.

120
00:06:48,964 --> 00:06:50,664
It's an incomplete embryo.

121
00:06:50,697 --> 00:06:52,964
Once you remove it from
the cultivation solution,

122
00:06:52,997 --> 00:06:54,264
it'll die right away.

123
00:06:54,297 --> 00:06:56,064
Got it, Tokiko.

124
00:06:56,097 --> 00:06:58,664
But I've got one last
thing to tell him.

125
00:06:58,697 --> 00:07:00,097
-Huh?

126
00:07:00,131 --> 00:07:00,797
-Chouno.

127
00:07:00,831 --> 00:07:02,031
Listen to me.

128
00:07:02,064 --> 00:07:04,731
Whether you become a
Homunculus or remain human,

129
00:07:04,764 --> 00:07:06,531
if you continue the
way you are, you're

130
00:07:06,564 --> 00:07:10,497
going to be by yourself forever
and you'll die all alone.

131
00:07:10,531 --> 00:07:12,697
Even if you have a grave,
there'll be no flowers.

132
00:07:12,731 --> 00:07:13,364
Nothing.

133
00:07:13,397 --> 00:07:14,831
-Do you think I care?

134
00:07:14,864 --> 00:07:16,897
-No one will even remember you.

135
00:07:16,931 --> 00:07:19,931
-I don't care what
happens after I die.

136
00:07:19,964 --> 00:07:21,031
-Listen.

137
00:07:21,064 --> 00:07:22,597
All you have to do is
make amends to those

138
00:07:22,631 --> 00:07:24,064
you've sacrificed and I'll--

139
00:07:24,097 --> 00:07:25,797
-You'll what?

140
00:07:25,831 --> 00:07:26,364
-Yes.

141
00:07:26,397 --> 00:07:26,964
You'll what?

142
00:07:26,997 --> 00:07:28,164
Please tell us.

143
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:30,297
However he dies is really
none of your business.

144
00:07:34,464 --> 00:07:36,831
You are quite a
hypocrite, I see.

145
00:07:36,864 --> 00:07:38,964
-Just what do you want, Jiro?

146
00:07:38,997 --> 00:07:40,231
-Well, well.

147
00:07:40,264 --> 00:07:42,697
You still haven't given
him my father's message.

148
00:07:42,731 --> 00:07:44,031
Then allow me.

149
00:07:44,064 --> 00:07:46,397
I've officially been named
the family successor.

150
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:48,531
All inheritance will go to me.

151
00:07:48,564 --> 00:07:50,264
-Oh, is that what it is?

152
00:07:50,297 --> 00:07:52,597
That really doesn't
matter to me anymore.

153
00:07:52,631 --> 00:07:53,631
-No kidding.

154
00:07:53,664 --> 00:07:54,664
Really?

155
00:07:54,697 --> 00:07:56,331
Well, I just want
you to know it does

156
00:07:56,364 --> 00:07:58,564
make a huge difference to me.

157
00:07:58,597 --> 00:08:00,297
Even though I was
born into this family,

158
00:08:00,331 --> 00:08:02,264
I was always treated
second rate just

159
00:08:02,297 --> 00:08:04,331
because I was born
a year after you.

160
00:08:04,364 --> 00:08:08,831
Ordinary education, ordinary
life, ordinary name.

161
00:08:08,864 --> 00:08:10,997
I wasn't granted
the suffix shaku,

162
00:08:11,031 --> 00:08:13,931
which carries the pride of
our great great grandfather.

163
00:08:13,964 --> 00:08:15,564
Jiro, the second born.

164
00:08:15,597 --> 00:08:18,131
Until you got sick, I was
nothing more than a worm,

165
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,664
crawling on the ground.

166
00:08:19,697 --> 00:08:20,431
-Well then.

167
00:08:20,464 --> 00:08:22,797
You must be satisfied now.

168
00:08:22,831 --> 00:08:25,564
-And that's the reason I
can't have you recovering

169
00:08:25,597 --> 00:08:29,264
from your illness, big brother.

170
00:08:29,297 --> 00:08:31,864
I didn't really understand
the conversation,

171
00:08:31,897 --> 00:08:34,931
but it seemed to me you'd be
saved if you had this, right?

172
00:08:34,964 --> 00:08:36,531
-Don't you dare, you fool.

173
00:08:36,564 --> 00:08:40,064
It only needs a little more
time before it's complete!

174
00:08:40,097 --> 00:08:40,564
No!

175
00:08:50,064 --> 00:08:51,831
JIRO: Nobody needs
a person like you.

176
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:54,731
-Don't you think it's funny
how twisted this family is?

177
00:08:54,764 --> 00:08:55,697
JIRO: Die!

178
00:08:55,731 --> 00:08:56,631
Hurry up and die!

179
00:08:56,664 --> 00:08:57,131
-Idiots.

180
00:09:02,764 --> 00:09:04,097
-So, are you dead yet?

181
00:09:08,697 --> 00:09:10,897
-Come to me!

182
00:09:10,931 --> 00:09:12,764
You and I are the same.

183
00:09:12,797 --> 00:09:14,931
You should want to
live more than anyone.

184
00:09:14,964 --> 00:09:16,697
More than anything!

185
00:09:16,731 --> 00:09:17,697
So come.

186
00:09:17,731 --> 00:09:20,297
Let us become a
Homunculus now, and be

187
00:09:20,331 --> 00:09:22,064
reborn into a
magnificent Papillon!

188
00:09:50,064 --> 00:09:51,097
-What happened?

189
00:09:51,131 --> 00:09:52,297
What happened to you?

190
00:09:55,597 --> 00:09:57,297
-Muto.

191
00:09:57,331 --> 00:10:00,331
As I recall, you did say
you wouldn't allow any more

192
00:10:00,364 --> 00:10:02,764
sacrifices, didn't you?

193
00:10:02,797 --> 00:10:04,364
Well, too bad.

194
00:10:11,597 --> 00:10:12,964
Ooh.

195
00:10:12,997 --> 00:10:16,464
As black as the devil himself,
and as scorching as all hell.

196
00:10:19,097 --> 00:10:21,597
Almost as sweet as a kiss.

197
00:10:21,631 --> 00:10:23,864
So this is what
humans taste like.

198
00:10:28,231 --> 00:10:29,997
TOKIKO (ON PHONE):
What's going on, Kazuki?

199
00:10:30,031 --> 00:10:30,931
Did something happen?

200
00:10:38,134 --> 00:10:39,967
-Now I am complete.

201
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,261
Papillon!

202
00:10:43,284 --> 00:10:44,884
-You pervert!

203
00:10:44,918 --> 00:10:47,051
-You mean perfect.

204
00:10:47,084 --> 00:10:49,446
I have achieved a
complete transformation.

205
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,413
Mm.

206
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:56,679
It does hurt a bit.

207
00:10:56,713 --> 00:10:57,146
Ooh.

208
00:10:57,179 --> 00:10:58,213
Ah.

209
00:10:58,246 --> 00:11:01,379
But it's good.

210
00:11:01,413 --> 00:11:02,379
-Look at that.

211
00:11:02,413 --> 00:11:03,846
It's-- It's-- It's a monster!

212
00:11:07,946 --> 00:11:09,879
-Not a monster.

213
00:11:09,913 --> 00:11:10,446
A superhuman!

214
00:11:17,446 --> 00:11:19,079
TOKIKO (ON PHONE):
Gunshots and screams.

215
00:11:19,113 --> 00:11:23,146
Chouno has become a humanoid
Homunculus, hasn't he?

216
00:11:23,179 --> 00:11:24,446
KAZUKI (ON PHONE): I'm sorry.

217
00:11:24,479 --> 00:11:26,279
-It's not your fault at all.

218
00:11:26,313 --> 00:11:28,279
Get out as soon as possible.

219
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:30,879
Just as humans and
monkeys are nothing alike,

220
00:11:30,913 --> 00:11:34,346
humanoid and animal Homunculi
are completely different.

221
00:11:34,379 --> 00:11:36,946
He's not an opponent you
can take on right now.

222
00:11:39,579 --> 00:11:41,479
Kazuki!

223
00:11:41,513 --> 00:11:42,946
-I know.

224
00:11:42,979 --> 00:11:46,113
But I still haven't
gotten the antidote.

225
00:11:46,146 --> 00:11:47,879
TOKIKO (ON PHONE):
Just forget it, Kazuki.

226
00:11:47,913 --> 00:11:48,846
-Buso Renkin!

227
00:11:52,146 --> 00:11:53,113
What?

228
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:54,579
-Ha ha.

229
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:56,479
-My Buso Renkin.

230
00:11:56,513 --> 00:11:57,813
It won't activate.

231
00:12:05,013 --> 00:12:06,379
-The game is over.

232
00:12:06,413 --> 00:12:07,279
[gurgling]

233
00:12:07,313 --> 00:12:08,379
-Oh.

234
00:12:08,413 --> 00:12:11,413
This body really uses
up a lot of energy.

235
00:12:11,446 --> 00:12:14,479
I guess I'll have to
get some food first.

236
00:12:14,513 --> 00:12:16,413
Almost midnight.

237
00:12:16,446 --> 00:12:21,279
Three hours left until that
girl turns into a Homunculus.

238
00:12:21,313 --> 00:12:23,213
You just lie there,
grief stricken

239
00:12:23,246 --> 00:12:24,679
by your own helplessness.

240
00:12:32,313 --> 00:12:32,979
-Jiro, sir.

241
00:12:33,013 --> 00:12:33,813
-Aren't you cold, sir?

242
00:12:37,046 --> 00:12:38,213
-Jiro, eh?

243
00:12:38,246 --> 00:12:39,046
Hm.

244
00:12:39,079 --> 00:12:41,279
Well, I guess we do look alike.

245
00:12:43,979 --> 00:12:44,846
-Hm?

246
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:46,179
Hey.

247
00:12:46,213 --> 00:12:48,379
Did you just hear something
coming from the front porch?

248
00:12:48,413 --> 00:12:49,813
-You're imagining things.

249
00:12:49,846 --> 00:12:50,946
-I know.

250
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:53,546
Anyone who can tell me
apart from Jiro lives.

251
00:12:53,579 --> 00:12:54,513
That's fun.

252
00:12:54,546 --> 00:12:55,846
-Let's check it out.

253
00:12:55,879 --> 00:12:58,379
-Whatever.

254
00:12:58,413 --> 00:12:59,746
-Now let's see.

255
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:03,146
I wonder how many
will figure it out.

256
00:13:03,179 --> 00:13:04,179
MAN: Jiro, sir--

257
00:13:04,213 --> 00:13:06,579
MAN: Please don't
scare us like that.

258
00:13:06,613 --> 00:13:10,379
[gurgling]

259
00:13:10,413 --> 00:13:12,479
TOKIKO (ON PHONE): Kazuki?

260
00:13:12,513 --> 00:13:14,279
Kazuki.

261
00:13:14,313 --> 00:13:16,379
Answer me.

262
00:13:16,413 --> 00:13:17,446
Kazuki?

263
00:13:17,479 --> 00:13:19,613
Do you hear me?

264
00:13:19,646 --> 00:13:20,113
Kazuki!

265
00:13:23,213 --> 00:13:24,246
Answer me.

266
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:25,746
KAZUKI (ON PHONE):
I can hear you.

267
00:13:25,779 --> 00:13:26,579
Tokiko.

268
00:13:26,613 --> 00:13:29,046
-Thank goodness you woke up.

269
00:13:29,079 --> 00:13:31,779
You must get out
of there right now.

270
00:13:31,813 --> 00:13:34,313
-I can still fight.

271
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:35,579
TOKIKO (ON PHONE): Impossible.

272
00:13:35,613 --> 00:13:38,313
You're only starting to
because of healing effects

273
00:13:38,346 --> 00:13:40,046
of the Kakugane.

274
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,713
Wait until the next
Warrior years you got it?

275
00:13:42,746 --> 00:13:43,913
-But what about the antidote?

276
00:13:43,946 --> 00:13:44,913
There won't be time.

277
00:13:44,946 --> 00:13:46,313
TOKIKO (ON PHONE):
Enough already.

278
00:13:46,346 --> 00:13:48,513
You've done more than enough.

279
00:13:48,546 --> 00:13:49,579
It's OK.

280
00:13:49,613 --> 00:13:51,546
I've accepted my fate.

281
00:13:51,579 --> 00:13:53,446
Just get back here quick.

282
00:13:53,479 --> 00:13:56,446
Everyone's waiting for you.

283
00:13:56,479 --> 00:13:57,679
-Do me a favor.

284
00:13:57,713 --> 00:14:00,846
Please put Mahiro and
the others on the phone.

285
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:02,646
-I peeled some apples for you.

287
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:07,379
-Hey Kazuki.

288
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:09,013
Calling for a back up after all!

289
00:14:09,046 --> 00:14:10,213
All right!

290
00:14:10,246 --> 00:14:12,479
I'm ready to show you the
true power of Okakura.

291
00:14:12,513 --> 00:14:13,413
-Right.

292
00:14:13,446 --> 00:14:14,613
I want to see it.

293
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:15,113
-Um.

294
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:16,079
Kazuki.

295
00:14:16,113 --> 00:14:17,713
That copy of "Erotic
Ladies Maximum"

296
00:14:17,746 --> 00:14:19,346
you had under your pillow.

297
00:14:19,379 --> 00:14:21,013
I've hidden it somewhere else.

298
00:14:21,046 --> 00:14:22,479
You'll have to be
more careful, man.

299
00:14:22,513 --> 00:14:27,179
If Tokiko or Mahiro find it,
they might get upset or angry.

300
00:14:27,213 --> 00:14:29,846
-Thanks for saving me, Daihama.

301
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:31,213
-Just a warning for you.

302
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:33,679
When you return, come
through the back.

303
00:14:33,713 --> 00:14:35,946
The dorm adviser's really
got his eyes out for you,

304
00:14:35,979 --> 00:14:37,779
so you had better be careful.

305
00:14:37,813 --> 00:14:39,013
-Right.

306
00:14:39,046 --> 00:14:42,979

Answer at roll call for me.

Hey big brother.

308
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:45,746
Tokiko is doing fine.

309
00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:47,079
Leave her to me.

310
00:14:47,113 --> 00:14:48,946
I'm taking good care of her.

311
00:14:48,979 --> 00:14:50,546
We're all having
apples right now,

312
00:14:50,579 --> 00:14:52,379
but if you don't
come back quickly,

313
00:14:52,413 --> 00:14:54,613
there aren't gonna
be any left for you.

314
00:14:54,646 --> 00:14:57,313
-Well, just save some for me.

315
00:14:57,346 --> 00:14:59,813
I can't go back
right away, but--

316
00:14:59,846 --> 00:15:00,713
-Kazuki.

KAZUKI (ON PHONE): Tokiko.

318
00:15:02,513 --> 00:15:03,779
I'm OK.

319
00:15:03,813 --> 00:15:05,946
Hearing everyone's voices.

320
00:15:05,979 --> 00:15:08,946
I feel like it really
gave me some strength.

321
00:15:08,979 --> 00:15:12,013
I'll get the antidote
and be back for sure.

322
00:15:12,046 --> 00:15:14,046
Just trust me.

323
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,646
Listen, Tokiko.

324
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:17,646
I'll be borrowing
some of your power.

-Not a single one.

330
00:15:34,046 --> 00:15:35,313
-What's going on out there?

331
00:15:35,346 --> 00:15:37,346
What's all the commotion?

332
00:15:37,379 --> 00:15:39,213
Hm?

333
00:15:39,246 --> 00:15:41,546
Hmph.

334
00:15:41,579 --> 00:15:42,479
-Father.

335
00:15:42,513 --> 00:15:42,979
-Huh?

336
00:15:46,846 --> 00:15:49,079
Whoa, what a fantastic costume.

337
00:15:49,113 --> 00:15:51,379
What party are you
going to tonight, Jiro?

338
00:15:54,646 --> 00:15:56,013
-That's right.

339
00:15:56,046 --> 00:16:00,846
It's a memorial in memory of the
dear, deceased Koushaku Chouno.

340
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:01,346
-Jiro.

341
00:16:09,846 --> 00:16:11,179
-I get it now.

342
00:16:11,213 --> 00:16:13,813
Koushaku Chouno
didn't die tonight.

343
00:16:13,846 --> 00:16:17,913
He's been dead for
a long time already.

344
00:16:17,946 --> 00:16:20,379
Now it's time for the
after party to begin!

345
00:16:23,479 --> 00:16:26,546
Let's celebrate the birth
of the Homunculus Papillon!

346
00:16:29,479 --> 00:16:32,113
Since this world doesn't
need Koushaku Chouno,

347
00:16:32,146 --> 00:16:36,313
I'll set his legacy all
on fire and burn it down.

348
00:16:36,346 --> 00:16:40,679
I'll light a bonfire befitting
of this icy dark night.

349
00:16:40,713 --> 00:16:41,913
A magnificent bonfire!

350
00:16:41,946 --> 00:16:44,546
KAZUKI: I won't let
you do such a thing.

351
00:16:44,579 --> 00:16:45,979
-You, huh?

352
00:16:46,013 --> 00:16:48,113
Now, I told you to
give into your despair.

353
00:16:48,146 --> 00:16:48,613
-Chouno!

354
00:16:48,646 --> 00:16:49,113
-Yes?

355
00:16:51,613 --> 00:16:53,113
-My Kakugane.

356
00:16:53,146 --> 00:16:54,146
-Listen, Tokiko.

357
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:56,213
I'll be borrowing
some of your power.

358
00:16:56,246 --> 00:16:59,513
Double Buso Renkin!

359
00:17:03,946 --> 00:17:06,079
Time to settle this.

360
00:17:06,113 --> 00:17:08,213
-Come on.

361
00:17:08,246 --> 00:17:09,613
-So, your wounds
have healed, huh?

362
00:17:12,213 --> 00:17:13,813
-Double tomahawk?

363
00:17:13,846 --> 00:17:14,713
No.

364
00:17:14,746 --> 00:17:16,546
Double lance, huh?

365
00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:17,579
Nice.

366
00:17:17,613 --> 00:17:20,846
But are you able to
use it skillfully?

367
00:17:20,879 --> 00:17:23,713
Covered with wounds, exhausted.

368
00:17:23,746 --> 00:17:25,479
Your precious
double lance appears

369
00:17:25,513 --> 00:17:28,779
unstable it looks like
it's going to fall apart.

370
00:17:28,813 --> 00:17:30,779
You think you could
beat me like that?

371
00:17:30,813 --> 00:17:33,846
Don't make me laugh.

372
00:17:33,879 --> 00:17:36,446
[coughing]

373
00:17:36,479 --> 00:17:37,513
TOKIKO (ON PHONE): Kazuki.

374
00:17:37,546 --> 00:17:40,079
What was that awful
sound I just heard?

375
00:17:40,113 --> 00:17:41,813
-Chouno just coughed up blood.

376
00:17:41,846 --> 00:17:44,579
TOKIKO (ON PHONE): Does
Chouno have an emblem mark?

377
00:17:44,613 --> 00:17:46,446
-Actually, I don't
see one anywhere.

378
00:17:46,479 --> 00:17:48,046
TOKIKO (ON PHONE): I see.

379
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:48,846
Kazuki.

380
00:17:48,879 --> 00:17:50,046
No, Chouno.

381
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,679
Listen carefully.

382
00:17:51,713 --> 00:17:53,746
Your transformation
was unsuccessful.

383
00:17:53,779 --> 00:17:55,479
Using an embryo
before completion

384
00:17:55,513 --> 00:17:58,246
caused something to go wrong.

385
00:17:58,279 --> 00:18:00,246
You turned into a
Homunculus, but you still

386
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:02,246
retained your diseased body.

387
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:04,179
With an immortal
and diseased body,

388
00:18:04,213 --> 00:18:06,746
you'll continue to
experience pain and suffering

389
00:18:06,779 --> 00:18:08,413
indefinitely.

390
00:18:08,446 --> 00:18:09,946
That's the price
you're going to have

391
00:18:09,979 --> 00:18:12,313
to pay for attempting
to lengthen your life,

392
00:18:12,346 --> 00:18:15,813
while sacrificing the
lives of so many others.

393
00:18:15,846 --> 00:18:18,513
-My transformation
may have failed,

394
00:18:18,546 --> 00:18:21,813
but it looks like I may
have another chance.

395
00:18:21,846 --> 00:18:24,213
Since I've got one more
life standing in front of me

396
00:18:24,246 --> 00:18:26,379
right now.

397
00:18:26,413 --> 00:18:29,946
The antidote is in the box
hidden behind the incubator.

398
00:18:29,979 --> 00:18:32,179
It'll explode instantly
if you force it

399
00:18:32,213 --> 00:18:35,946
with anything other
than this key.

400
00:18:35,979 --> 00:18:37,313
Now come and get it.

401
00:18:37,346 --> 00:18:39,779
Time to eat you and
get the Kakugane!

402
00:18:39,813 --> 00:18:41,813
Then when the woman
transforms and joins me,

403
00:18:41,846 --> 00:18:43,979
I'll burn down this
world to ashes!

404
00:18:44,013 --> 00:18:44,813
Ha ha ha!

405
00:18:44,846 --> 00:18:46,046
-Not if I can help it!

406
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:48,013
I'm going to stop
you once and for all.

407
00:18:48,046 --> 00:18:48,846
-Kazuki!

408
00:18:48,879 --> 00:18:51,946
-This will be the final blow!

409
00:18:51,979 --> 00:18:53,746
-The Kakugane is mine!

[shout]

411
00:19:20,379 --> 00:19:21,546
-Impossible.

412
00:19:21,579 --> 00:19:24,379
I may not be complete, but
I'm still a superhuman.

413
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,379
How could a mere
humans like you--

414
00:19:26,413 --> 00:19:29,646
-I may be just a human,
but unlike you, I've

415
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,479
already fought many
life and death battles.

416
00:19:34,846 --> 00:19:37,079
-So you're stronger and
you defeated me, but now

417
00:19:37,113 --> 00:19:38,546
what are you going to do?

418
00:19:38,579 --> 00:19:40,379
I've become a
Homunculus, which means

419
00:19:40,413 --> 00:19:43,413
I won't stop eating
human beings.

420
00:19:43,446 --> 00:19:46,446
Not to mention the fact that
the key to that woman's antidote

421
00:19:46,479 --> 00:19:47,679
is in this stomach.

422
00:19:47,713 --> 00:19:50,413
Will you wait for it to
come out with my excrement?

423
00:19:50,446 --> 00:19:52,046
Come on, what will
you do with me now?

424
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:58,246
What will you do?

425
00:19:58,279 --> 00:20:00,379
-Forgive me, Koushaku Chouno!

426
00:20:03,446 --> 00:20:05,546

-The-- the key!

430
00:20:39,246 --> 00:20:41,546
The key.

-Kazuki.

436
00:21:21,246 --> 00:21:24,379
Did you know that up close,
your Buso Renkin energy

437
00:21:24,413 --> 00:21:26,946
is a beautiful bright
golden yellow color?

438
00:21:26,979 --> 00:21:29,046
Similar to the rays of the sun.

439
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:31,679
It took me a little
while, but how

440
00:21:31,713 --> 00:21:35,113
about we name your
lance Sunlight Heart?

441
00:21:35,146 --> 00:21:37,313
What do you think?

442
00:21:37,346 --> 00:21:37,813
-Tokiko.

443
00:21:42,646 --> 00:21:43,279
-Kazuki.

444
00:21:43,313 --> 00:21:45,679
Thank you very much.

00:21:45,713 --> 00:21:47,079

This is the true power of

Next time, whether or
not you're a hypocrite,
