00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,500
NARRATOR: A supernatural
alloy produced

2
00:00:14,533 --> 00:00:18,900
by gathering the essence
of alchemy is the Kakugane.

3
00:00:18,933 --> 00:00:22,866
This device activates upon a
person's fighting instinct,

4
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,466
manifesting the
possessor's inner power

5
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,100
into a tangible form, creating
a weapon like no other.

6
00:00:30,133 --> 00:00:32,566
Its name, Buso Renkin.

7
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:39,600
[theme music]

8
00:02:11,274 --> 00:02:14,136
NARRATOR: The all out
attack on Victor has begun.

9
00:02:14,136 --> 00:02:17,236
The Alchemist Warriors made
full use of their Buso Renkins

10
00:02:17,269 --> 00:02:20,269
and tried to corner Victor.

11
00:02:20,303 --> 00:02:23,503
But Victor evolved
into his third stage

12
00:02:23,536 --> 00:02:27,669
and showed the Alchemist Army
the true extent of his powers.

13
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:34,136
Meanwhile, Kazuki and
the others arrived

14
00:02:34,169 --> 00:02:36,536
at Newton Apple
Academy for Girls.

15
00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:38,936
They came upon
the white Kakugane

16
00:02:38,969 --> 00:02:43,703
that could restore Kazuki
be back to his human form.

17
00:02:43,736 --> 00:02:48,603
However--

18
00:02:52,069 --> 00:02:53,836
FEMALE VOICE: It'll
be a few more days

19
00:02:53,869 --> 00:02:58,936
before the white
Kakugane is completed.

20
00:02:58,969 --> 00:03:05,503
Until then, think carefully
before you make your decision.

21
00:03:05,536 --> 00:03:07,803
-It must be quite a
lot for you to handle,

22
00:03:07,836 --> 00:03:09,903
but you should
consider yourself lucky

23
00:03:09,936 --> 00:03:11,269
since you still have a choice.

24
00:03:36,869 --> 00:03:38,303
-Do you have a pencil?

25
00:03:38,336 --> 00:03:39,469
I forgot my pencil.

26
00:03:39,503 --> 00:03:40,469
-Aw.

27
00:03:40,503 --> 00:03:42,269
I just hate going
to summer school.

28
00:03:42,303 --> 00:03:46,203
It's supposed to
be summer vacation.

29
00:03:46,236 --> 00:03:47,469
Huh?

30
00:03:47,503 --> 00:03:48,736
-Oh, there they are.

31
00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:50,336
-The bell's already
rung, and you guys

32
00:03:50,369 --> 00:03:52,269
are still taking your time?

33
00:03:52,303 --> 00:03:53,236
-Hey.

34
00:03:53,269 --> 00:03:54,803
It's been a while!

35
00:03:54,836 --> 00:03:56,203
-Come on, let's go.

36
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:56,903
-Kazuki!

37
00:03:56,936 --> 00:03:58,969
Tokiko!

38
00:03:59,003 --> 00:04:03,103
-If we don't hurry, we'll
be late for home room.

39
00:04:03,136 --> 00:04:05,303
-So, how'd it go?

40
00:04:05,336 --> 00:04:08,236
Any new developments
between you two?

41
00:04:08,269 --> 00:04:09,103
-Huh?

42
00:04:09,136 --> 00:04:10,769
What do you mean by that?

43
00:04:10,803 --> 00:04:12,869
-Isn't it about time you
made it clear to her?

44
00:04:12,903 --> 00:04:14,569
I'm sure Tokiko feels--

45
00:04:14,603 --> 00:04:15,569
-Argh.

46
00:04:15,603 --> 00:04:16,236
Stop.

47
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:17,003
Stay where you are.

48
00:04:17,036 --> 00:04:19,536
I'll splatter your guts!

49
00:04:19,569 --> 00:04:21,036
You guys are so annoying.

50
00:04:24,936 --> 00:04:26,069
-They look happy.

51
00:04:26,103 --> 00:04:27,603
-I'd say they are!

52
00:04:27,636 --> 00:04:30,669
-You would think they didn't
have a worry in the world.

53
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:32,969
-What's there really
to worry about?

54
00:04:33,003 --> 00:04:35,803
Kazuki hasn't done
anything wrong in his life.

55
00:04:35,836 --> 00:04:38,136
He should just return to being
human with great dignity.

56
00:04:38,169 --> 00:04:39,469
-You're right.

57
00:04:39,503 --> 00:04:40,936
Not only has he
done nothing wrong.

58
00:04:40,969 --> 00:04:44,069
He's also protected this school
and the city again and again.

59
00:04:44,103 --> 00:04:46,136
But--

60
00:04:46,169 --> 00:04:47,636
BRAVO: And because
of the kind of boy

61
00:04:47,669 --> 00:04:51,436
he is, that's why he won't
be able to just leave

62
00:04:51,469 --> 00:04:54,203
Victor like that in the end.

63
00:04:54,236 --> 00:04:56,903
-He really is a very strong boy.

64
00:04:56,936 --> 00:04:58,169
-Yes, he is.

65
00:04:58,203 --> 00:05:00,536
It's almost as if he were
born to become a Warrior,

66
00:05:00,569 --> 00:05:01,803
and nothing else.

67
00:05:01,836 --> 00:05:05,103
He's only going to become
stronger in mind and body.

68
00:05:05,136 --> 00:05:06,536
-Hm.

69
00:05:06,569 --> 00:05:13,803
-But-- we shouldn't forget,
he is still a 17-year-old high

70
00:05:13,836 --> 00:05:14,669
school kid.

71
00:05:23,069 --> 00:05:24,036
-So it's true!

72
00:05:24,069 --> 00:05:25,136
You've returned!

73
00:05:25,169 --> 00:05:26,069
Welcome back!

74
00:05:26,103 --> 00:05:26,903
-Hi, Mahiro!

75
00:05:26,936 --> 00:05:27,836
I'm back!

76
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:29,803
-Tokiko, you're
back, you're back!

77
00:05:29,836 --> 00:05:30,503
Oh, yeah.

78
00:05:30,536 --> 00:05:32,069
Welcome back, Kazuki.

79
00:05:32,103 --> 00:05:34,103
-Hey.

80
00:05:34,136 --> 00:05:35,236
-Now, now.

81
00:05:35,269 --> 00:05:36,503
-It may not look like
it, but she was really

82
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:37,769
worried about you.

83
00:05:37,803 --> 00:05:38,569
-So--

84
00:05:38,603 --> 00:05:39,936
-You came back in one piece.

85
00:05:39,969 --> 00:05:42,969
That must mean your mission
was successful, right, Kazuki?

86
00:05:43,003 --> 00:05:43,636
-That's right.

87
00:05:46,203 --> 00:05:47,336
-Well, listen, guys.

88
00:05:47,369 --> 00:05:49,569
We're only gonna have
school until noon today.

89
00:05:49,603 --> 00:05:51,769
So what do you say we
hang out afterwards?

90
00:05:51,803 --> 00:05:53,036
-That's a great idea.

91
00:05:53,069 --> 00:05:55,969
Kazuki, you and Tokiko are
gonna come with us, right?

92
00:05:56,003 --> 00:05:56,836
-Of course.

93
00:05:56,869 --> 00:05:58,069
So, where are we going?

94
00:05:58,103 --> 00:06:00,403
-I'd love to go to
the amusement park!

95
00:06:00,436 --> 00:06:02,136
-Hey, good call, Mahiro.

96
00:06:02,169 --> 00:06:03,003
-What about the pool?

97
00:06:03,036 --> 00:06:04,769
-Sounds good, too.

98
00:06:04,803 --> 00:06:06,236
-But the girls at
the pool won't be

99
00:06:06,269 --> 00:06:08,369
wearing their school
swimwear, Daihama.

100
00:06:08,403 --> 00:06:09,669
-Kazuki!

101
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:11,969
-Something like bowling
could be a lot of fun, too.

102
00:06:12,003 --> 00:06:14,036
-How about a Go parlor?

103
00:06:14,069 --> 00:06:15,903
-The amusement
park's a better idea.

104
00:06:15,936 --> 00:06:18,869
-You really love amusement
parks, don't you, Okakura?

105
00:06:18,903 --> 00:06:20,836
-As a matter of fact,
I love them, too.

106
00:06:20,869 --> 00:06:21,836
-Me too!

107
00:06:28,803 --> 00:06:30,236
-What do you mean by that?

108
00:06:30,269 --> 00:06:32,069
-The matter is obvious.

109
00:06:32,103 --> 00:06:34,603
After we win this ongoing
battle against Victor,

110
00:06:34,636 --> 00:06:37,869
the re-extermination of
Kazuki Muto will be next.

111
00:06:37,903 --> 00:06:41,869
And that's all there is to it.

112
00:06:41,903 --> 00:06:43,103
What are you gonna do?

113
00:06:46,236 --> 00:06:47,203
-Warrior Chief Hiwatari.

114
00:06:47,236 --> 00:06:48,436
-What is it?

115
00:06:48,469 --> 00:06:50,136
-The seventh and eighth
units have almost

116
00:06:50,169 --> 00:06:51,436
been completely wiped out.

117
00:06:51,469 --> 00:06:54,136
An order has been issues to
withdraw the second class

118
00:06:54,169 --> 00:06:55,936
combat deployment immediately.

119
00:06:55,969 --> 00:06:59,203
We've been ordered to back up
Buster Baron with his attacks,

120
00:06:59,236 --> 00:07:00,436
instead.

121
00:07:00,469 --> 00:07:01,269
-All right.

122
00:07:01,303 --> 00:07:02,336
That means all of you ladies.

123
00:07:02,369 --> 00:07:04,136
So you'd better get
yourselves ready.

124
00:07:04,169 --> 00:07:06,536
Busujima, you'll be
returning to headquarters.

125
00:07:06,569 --> 00:07:08,503
-Hold it.

126
00:07:08,536 --> 00:07:11,869
Are you saying that you're going
to use Kazuki to defeat Victor,

127
00:07:11,903 --> 00:07:14,269
then you're just going to
kill him like he's nothing?

128
00:07:14,303 --> 00:07:16,869
-And what are you
gonna do about it, huh?

129
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:18,169
You know what?

130
00:07:18,203 --> 00:07:20,536
Discussing this with you is
simply a waste of my time.

131
00:07:20,569 --> 00:07:22,469
Right now what we
gotta do is focus

132
00:07:22,503 --> 00:07:25,569
on killing the enemy that's
right in front of our eyes.

133
00:07:25,603 --> 00:07:26,069
Understand?

134
00:07:29,803 --> 00:07:32,136
Besides, ultimately
it doesn't matter

135
00:07:32,169 --> 00:07:34,236
which one we end up
taking care of first.

136
00:07:34,269 --> 00:07:37,069
If we had killed that brat back
then when we had the chance,

137
00:07:37,103 --> 00:07:41,069
then things wouldn't have
gotten this complicated.

138
00:07:41,103 --> 00:07:42,336
Absurd, isn't it?

139
00:07:42,369 --> 00:07:45,136
Well, that's just
the world we live in.

140
00:07:45,169 --> 00:07:46,436
-All right, then.

141
00:07:46,469 --> 00:07:48,936
I will concentrate on the
enemy before my eyes for now,

142
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:51,469
but whatever actions I
need to take after that,

143
00:07:51,503 --> 00:07:53,103
I will decide when
the time comes.

144
00:07:53,136 --> 00:07:55,736
-Glad you finally
see things my way.

145
00:07:55,769 --> 00:07:56,703
Here you go.

146
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:03,072
SHISUI (VOICEOVER): Kazuki.

147
00:08:03,106 --> 00:08:04,406
I won't give up on you.

148
00:08:10,739 --> 00:08:15,206
-Can you believe we have
homework on the first day?

149
00:08:15,239 --> 00:08:17,672
-Hey Tokiko, Kazuki's
taking a little longer,

150
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:18,772
so we're gonna go on ahead.

151
00:08:18,806 --> 00:08:20,472
You mind waiting for him?

152
00:08:20,506 --> 00:08:22,439
-We'll be at the station, OK?

153
00:08:22,472 --> 00:08:24,439
-I guess I don't
mind, but wouldn't it

154
00:08:24,472 --> 00:08:26,272
be better if we all
just go together?

155
00:08:26,306 --> 00:08:27,072
-All right!

156
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:28,206
We're counting on you!

157
00:08:28,239 --> 00:08:29,606
-See you later!

158
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:31,306
-Oh, hey, wait.

159
00:08:31,339 --> 00:08:32,272
Hold on a second.

160
00:08:32,306 --> 00:08:34,039
[sigh]

161
00:08:43,139 --> 00:08:44,472
-You came back in one piece!

162
00:08:44,506 --> 00:08:46,872
That must mean your mission
was successful, right Kazuki?

163
00:08:46,906 --> 00:08:47,806
That's right?

164
00:08:50,706 --> 00:08:53,372
I completely lied to them.

165
00:08:53,406 --> 00:08:55,639
GOTA: Well, isn't that
better than making

166
00:08:55,672 --> 00:08:57,906
them worry unnecessarily?

167
00:08:57,939 --> 00:08:59,139
-Gota!

168
00:08:59,172 --> 00:09:01,272
-I was worried that perhaps
Tokiko was being treated

169
00:09:01,306 --> 00:09:04,506
like an outcast at school,
but your younger sister

170
00:09:04,539 --> 00:09:05,906
and your friends
are good people.

171
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:14,039
Whatever choice you
make in the end,

172
00:09:14,072 --> 00:09:16,906
as long as you promise
not to hurt Tokiko,

173
00:09:16,939 --> 00:09:19,106
then I'll do whatever
I can to help you out.

174
00:09:19,139 --> 00:09:22,872
You have my word on that.

175
00:09:22,906 --> 00:09:25,172
If we are protecting
the same thing,

176
00:09:25,206 --> 00:09:26,972
I'd say that makes us allies.

177
00:09:27,006 --> 00:09:29,539
-Gota.

178
00:09:29,572 --> 00:09:31,306
-I won't be shaking your hand.

179
00:09:31,339 --> 00:09:34,672
We may be allies, but we're
still rivals for Tokiko's hand.

180
00:09:37,272 --> 00:09:37,739
-Hm.

181
00:09:42,972 --> 00:09:45,339
PAPILLON: So, what makes
that girl so great, anyway?

182
00:09:45,372 --> 00:09:45,939
-Huh?

183
00:09:45,972 --> 00:09:47,272
-I don't get it.

184
00:09:47,306 --> 00:09:50,006
It defies all explanation.

185
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:50,506
-Chouno!

186
00:09:50,539 --> 00:09:51,572
-Hi.

187
00:09:51,606 --> 00:09:52,872
-You're here.

188
00:09:52,906 --> 00:09:54,406
I was wondering why
I hadn't seen you

189
00:09:54,439 --> 00:09:56,306
since we left the
Girls' Academy.

190
00:09:56,339 --> 00:09:58,572
So tell me, where have
you been this whole time?

191
00:09:58,606 --> 00:10:01,406
-In my secret lab, of
course, conducting research

192
00:10:01,439 --> 00:10:02,839
on the white Kakugane.

193
00:10:02,872 --> 00:10:04,039
-What?

194
00:10:04,072 --> 00:10:06,072
You're planning on making
another white Kakugane?

195
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:09,606
-My ultimate goal is to
defeat the human Kazuki Muto

196
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:11,506
while achieving
my highest power.

197
00:10:11,539 --> 00:10:14,706
And for that to happen, a
white Kakugane is essential.

198
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:17,872
-But, remember what
Alexandria said?

199
00:10:17,906 --> 00:10:20,806
-How long would it take to
create another black Kakugane

200
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:24,972
from scratch, and then alter
it into a white Kakugane?

201
00:10:25,006 --> 00:10:26,472
ALEXANDRIA: The
process for creating

202
00:10:26,506 --> 00:10:31,272
a black Kakugane was
lost 100 years ago.

203
00:10:31,306 --> 00:10:35,406
Unfortunately, it would be just
about impossible for my aged

204
00:10:35,439 --> 00:10:38,639
brain to duplicate
one from scratch.

205
00:10:38,672 --> 00:10:39,906
-Hm.

206
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:42,639
When I was still a human
being, every doctor who saw me

207
00:10:42,672 --> 00:10:44,606
told me that my
days were numbered.

208
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:47,972
But, as you can see, I'm
still alive and kicking.

209
00:10:48,006 --> 00:10:50,472
A choice isn't something
that just falls from the sky

210
00:10:50,506 --> 00:10:51,539
and is given to you.

211
00:10:51,572 --> 00:10:53,639
You have to create it yourself.

212
00:10:53,672 --> 00:10:56,239
Muto, no matter what
your decision is,

213
00:10:56,272 --> 00:10:59,406
I'm not giving up on
settling our score.

214
00:10:59,439 --> 00:11:00,372
KAZUKI: Yeah.

215
00:11:00,406 --> 00:11:01,006
I know.

216
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:07,472
Hey, Tokiko!

217
00:11:07,506 --> 00:11:09,372
Sorry to keep you waiting.

218
00:11:09,406 --> 00:11:10,539
-What took you so long?

219
00:11:10,572 --> 00:11:12,072
Everything OK?

220
00:11:12,106 --> 00:11:12,639
-Huh?

221
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:13,806
Oh, I'm fine.

222
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,072
Where is everyone?

223
00:11:15,106 --> 00:11:16,472
-Well, they all went ahead.

224
00:11:16,506 --> 00:11:18,539
But if we hurry,
we can catch up.

225
00:11:18,572 --> 00:11:19,539
-Oh, really?

226
00:11:19,572 --> 00:11:20,539
Then let's go!

227
00:11:26,539 --> 00:11:27,939
It's pretty hot.

228
00:11:27,972 --> 00:11:28,906
-Huh?

229
00:11:28,939 --> 00:11:31,806
Oh, yeah.

230
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,772
Kazuki, are you all right?

231
00:11:34,806 --> 00:11:37,639
Given the circumstances,
are you OK?

232
00:11:37,672 --> 00:11:38,906
-I'm fine.

233
00:11:38,939 --> 00:11:40,439
-All right, then.

234
00:11:40,472 --> 00:11:42,372
If you say so, Kazuki.

235
00:11:42,406 --> 00:11:43,539
-Yup.

236
00:11:43,572 --> 00:11:45,372
I'm fine.

237
00:11:45,406 --> 00:11:46,372
Let's go.

238
00:11:58,272 --> 00:12:01,106
-The sky is so blue, isn't it?

239
00:12:01,139 --> 00:12:02,072
-Yeah.

240
00:12:02,106 --> 00:12:03,572
This year is
definitely a hot one.

241
00:12:09,806 --> 00:12:12,539
[scraping]

242
00:12:12,572 --> 00:12:14,472
-Mm.

243
00:12:14,506 --> 00:12:15,339
-Here you go.

244
00:12:15,372 --> 00:12:16,239
Thank you for waiting.

245
00:12:16,272 --> 00:12:17,706
-Thanks.

246
00:12:17,739 --> 00:12:18,872
Here you go.

247
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:20,172
Enjoy it.

248
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:22,639
-Uh, thank you.

249
00:12:22,672 --> 00:12:25,339
Uh--

250
00:12:25,372 --> 00:12:27,739
GIRL: Is yours good?

251
00:12:27,772 --> 00:12:29,772
-Mm-hm.

252
00:12:29,806 --> 00:12:31,272
-What is it?

253
00:12:31,306 --> 00:12:33,306
-I was just remembering
how when we were younger,

254
00:12:33,339 --> 00:12:35,139
Mahiro and I used to
eat snow cones all

255
00:12:35,172 --> 00:12:37,472
the time in the summer.

256
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:39,139
When I was a little
boy, I would always

257
00:12:39,172 --> 00:12:41,839
order melon flavored
syrup, and of course Mahiro

258
00:12:41,872 --> 00:12:43,972
would always get the
strawberry flavor.

259
00:12:44,006 --> 00:12:46,772
But this one time Mahiro
wanted to try the melon flavor,

260
00:12:46,806 --> 00:12:48,206
and so I gave her some.

261
00:12:48,239 --> 00:12:51,539
But it spilled on her dress,
so she started to cry.

262
00:12:51,572 --> 00:12:54,872
And I got flustered, and
I tried to console her.

263
00:12:54,906 --> 00:12:57,139
By the time she stopped
crying, both our shaved ices

264
00:12:57,172 --> 00:12:59,239
had melted.

265
00:12:59,272 --> 00:13:00,706
-It sounds like
you and your sister

266
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:02,239
have always gotten along, huh?

267
00:13:08,939 --> 00:13:10,239
This is the first
time I've heard

268
00:13:10,272 --> 00:13:13,106
you talk about your
childhood, Kazuki.

269
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:14,506
-Oh, really?

270
00:13:14,539 --> 00:13:16,406
-I find it rather
refreshing to hear people

271
00:13:16,439 --> 00:13:18,306
talk about their past, you know?

272
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:20,739
Perhaps because all I
have now is the present.

273
00:13:20,772 --> 00:13:22,939
-What do you mean by that?

274
00:13:22,972 --> 00:13:24,106
-I have no past.

275
00:13:24,139 --> 00:13:25,472
According to the
doctor, it seems

276
00:13:25,506 --> 00:13:27,406
I have partial memory
loss due to trauma.

277
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:29,406
At least that's what
they say, anyway.

278
00:13:29,439 --> 00:13:34,739
And because of that, all my
past memories are very vague.

279
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:35,872
All right.

280
00:13:35,906 --> 00:13:37,739
I think that's enough
talk about me for now.

281
00:13:37,772 --> 00:13:39,939
Anyway, that's the way it is.

282
00:13:39,972 --> 00:13:41,372
-I don't know.

283
00:13:41,406 --> 00:13:45,006
Maybe there just isn't a way
to unlock your past after all.

284
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:48,639
But I would like to see the
future with you, Tokiko.

285
00:13:48,672 --> 00:13:51,006
-Oh.

286
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,272
Yes, I agree.

287
00:13:52,306 --> 00:13:55,806
I also would like to see
the future with you, Kazuki.

288
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,272
-Are you blushing?

289
00:13:57,306 --> 00:13:58,106
-Shut up!

290
00:13:58,139 --> 00:13:59,172
Why do you say things like that?

291
00:14:02,006 --> 00:14:03,372
-Uh--

292
00:14:03,406 --> 00:14:05,006
[groaning]

293
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:06,439
-Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

294
00:14:06,472 --> 00:14:09,406
MAHIRO: Oh, so this
is where you both are.

295
00:14:09,439 --> 00:14:10,539
-What are you doing here?

296
00:14:10,572 --> 00:14:11,772
You kept us waiting.

297
00:14:11,806 --> 00:14:14,272
-I was worried you two had
run off into the sunset.

298
00:14:14,306 --> 00:14:16,339
-Maybe you should
update your slang.

299
00:14:16,372 --> 00:14:17,139
-We're sorry.

300
00:14:17,172 --> 00:14:19,172
I guess we just got distracted.

301
00:14:19,206 --> 00:14:20,706
-Wait a minute.

302
00:14:20,739 --> 00:14:21,939
Snow cones?

303
00:14:21,972 --> 00:14:23,039
-Hey, let's have some.

304
00:14:23,072 --> 00:14:24,106
-No!

305
00:14:24,139 --> 00:14:25,506
We have to hurry to
the amusement park.

306
00:14:25,539 --> 00:14:27,972
-Whoa, I guess you really
do like amusement parks.

307
00:14:28,006 --> 00:14:30,172
-It just means that
he's still boy at heart.

308
00:14:30,206 --> 00:14:31,172
[laughter]

309
00:14:31,206 --> 00:14:34,172
-Get off my back, will ya?

310
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:36,139
[screaming]

311
00:14:36,172 --> 00:14:39,139
[laughter]

312
00:14:39,172 --> 00:14:40,139
MAHIRO: Hang on!

313
00:14:44,172 --> 00:14:45,139
-Help me!

314
00:14:49,172 --> 00:14:51,106
-Whoa!

315
00:14:51,139 --> 00:14:53,072
[laughter]

316
00:14:53,106 --> 00:14:54,539
-Too much spinning!

317
00:15:00,106 --> 00:15:04,072
[scream]

318
00:15:04,106 --> 00:15:06,039
[laughter]

319
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:07,006
-Yeah, yeah.

320
00:15:10,606 --> 00:15:12,506
[scream]

321
00:15:12,539 --> 00:15:14,472
-Okakura?

322
00:15:14,506 --> 00:15:16,406
-Whoa!

323
00:15:16,439 --> 00:15:19,339
Whoa!

324
00:15:19,372 --> 00:15:21,772
Whoa!

325
00:15:21,806 --> 00:15:22,939
-Okakura?

326
00:15:22,972 --> 00:15:24,972
Okakura, are you all right?

327
00:15:25,006 --> 00:15:28,472
-For someone who loves amusement
parks, you're quite a crybaby.

328
00:15:28,506 --> 00:15:31,006
-Let's go on the next one!

329
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:33,039
-Whoa!

330
00:15:33,072 --> 00:15:35,039
-Come on, Tokiko, let's go.

331
00:15:35,072 --> 00:15:35,706
-No.

332
00:15:35,739 --> 00:15:36,839
I'll skip this one.

333
00:15:36,872 --> 00:15:38,306
I'm gonna take a break.

334
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:39,839
-Oh, OK.

335
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:42,072
Well then, Okakura,
Rokumasu, Daihama.

336
00:15:42,106 --> 00:15:42,872
Let's go.

337
00:15:42,906 --> 00:15:44,939
-Yeah!

338
00:15:44,972 --> 00:15:45,439
-Huh?

339
00:15:45,472 --> 00:15:46,906
-Hm.

340
00:15:46,939 --> 00:15:48,839
[scream]

341
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:52,339
-Okakura?

342
00:15:52,372 --> 00:15:52,839
Wait!

343
00:16:18,172 --> 00:16:20,139
-All right, let's ride
the flying carpet next!

344
00:16:25,172 --> 00:16:25,806
-Hey!

345
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:26,639
What are you doing?

346
00:16:26,672 --> 00:16:30,532
Wait for us!

347
00:16:30,532 --> 00:16:32,112
-Are we still going with them?

348
00:16:32,112 --> 00:16:33,112
-Yeah, let's go, let's go!

349
00:16:33,145 --> 00:16:34,112
-All right, Tokiko!

350
00:16:34,145 --> 00:16:36,078
You're coming, too!

351
00:16:36,112 --> 00:16:36,578
-Ah--

352
00:17:02,245 --> 00:17:04,445
-Oh, here she comes now.

353
00:17:04,478 --> 00:17:05,345
-Sorry, guys.

354
00:17:05,378 --> 00:17:06,812
Shouldn't we be getting back?

355
00:17:06,845 --> 00:17:07,945
-No!

356
00:17:07,978 --> 00:17:09,845
There's going to be an
after party with karaoke.

357
00:17:09,878 --> 00:17:10,645
-Karaoke?

358
00:17:10,678 --> 00:17:12,045
-That's right.

359
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:13,912
You're going to have a chance
to hear some of my hot rock n'

360
00:17:13,945 --> 00:17:14,878
roll styling.

361
00:17:14,912 --> 00:17:15,845
You'll love it.

362
00:17:15,878 --> 00:17:17,678
-I've come prepared
with earplugs.

363
00:17:17,712 --> 00:17:19,578
-Wait, why are you
carrying those around?

364
00:17:19,612 --> 00:17:22,045
-How dare you use earplugs
while I'm singing!

365
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:24,878
[laughter]

366
00:17:24,912 --> 00:17:28,212
-Hey, guys, I'm sorry, but
I think I'm gonna get going.

367
00:17:28,245 --> 00:17:29,345
-Aw, really?

368
00:17:29,378 --> 00:17:30,712
-Why, are you tired?

369
00:17:30,745 --> 00:17:31,778
Are you all right?

370
00:17:31,812 --> 00:17:33,045
-Mm-hm.

371
00:17:33,078 --> 00:17:35,245
-That's probably a smart move.

372
00:17:35,278 --> 00:17:37,078
-What the hell do
you mean by that?

373
00:17:37,112 --> 00:17:38,412
-In that case--

374
00:17:38,445 --> 00:17:39,378
-Hey, wait, Tokiko!

375
00:17:39,412 --> 00:17:41,078
You're coming with
us, aren't you?

376
00:17:41,112 --> 00:17:41,978
-You mustn't leave yet!

377
00:17:44,912 --> 00:17:46,245
-See you later, Kazuki.

378
00:17:46,278 --> 00:17:48,478
-Take it easy.

379
00:17:48,512 --> 00:17:49,712
-Be careful, all right?

380
00:17:49,745 --> 00:17:52,045
-Don't catch cold.

381
00:17:52,078 --> 00:17:54,012
-Sure.

382
00:17:54,045 --> 00:17:55,345
See ya.

383
00:17:55,378 --> 00:17:58,145
[excited chatter]

384
00:18:00,978 --> 00:18:01,445
TOKIKO: No.

385
00:18:01,478 --> 00:18:02,212
Really.

386
00:18:02,245 --> 00:18:03,212
You don't want me to sing.

387
00:18:03,245 --> 00:18:03,712
I promise.

388
00:18:23,278 --> 00:18:28,445
-How it will be used will
be your decision, Kazuki.

389
00:18:28,478 --> 00:18:31,378
-Whatever choice you
decide to make in the end,

390
00:18:31,412 --> 00:18:34,945
I will do anything within my
power to support you, Muto.

391
00:18:34,978 --> 00:18:38,445
But you must promise not
to make Tokiko suffer.

392
00:18:38,478 --> 00:18:41,412
-Muto, no matter what
your decision will be,

393
00:18:41,445 --> 00:18:45,578
I am not giving up on
settling my score with you.

394
00:18:45,612 --> 00:18:48,912
KAZUKI (VOICEOVER): The thing
is, I know what my decision is.

395
00:18:48,945 --> 00:18:50,178
Deep down, I already knew.

396
00:18:59,278 --> 00:19:07,212
But if I do that, I'll--
I'll protect everyone,

397
00:19:07,245 --> 00:19:10,878
but then who's
going to protect me?

398
00:19:10,912 --> 00:19:11,978
-Kazuki, you all right?

399
00:19:15,978 --> 00:19:17,445
-Tokiko.

400
00:19:17,478 --> 00:19:19,012
What are you doing here?

401
00:19:19,045 --> 00:19:22,445
-This is my special place.

402
00:19:22,478 --> 00:19:24,712
-Oh, that's right.

403
00:19:24,745 --> 00:19:27,512
-It isn't like you to leave
early like that, Kazuki.

404
00:19:27,545 --> 00:19:29,912
Everyone was really
worried about you.

405
00:19:29,945 --> 00:19:30,412
-Oh.

406
00:19:36,245 --> 00:19:37,678
-Huh?

407
00:19:37,712 --> 00:19:38,912
Oh, that's right.

408
00:19:38,945 --> 00:19:40,478
Kazuki.

409
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:41,745
Look, over there.

410
00:19:47,678 --> 00:19:50,978
-Th haunted factory
behind the school.

411
00:19:51,012 --> 00:19:54,712
-When we met for the first time
there, you tried to protect me.

412
00:19:54,745 --> 00:19:56,678
Thank you.

413
00:19:56,712 --> 00:19:58,445
-Huh?

414
00:19:58,478 --> 00:20:00,612
KAZUKI (VOICEOVER):
Oh, that's right.

415
00:20:00,645 --> 00:20:02,278
That day.

416
00:20:02,312 --> 00:20:03,645
I jumped in without
even thinking

417
00:20:03,678 --> 00:20:05,445
about what I was doing.

418
00:20:05,478 --> 00:20:08,678
I was simply determined
to protect the girl.

419
00:20:08,712 --> 00:20:10,078
The girl in front of my eyes.

420
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:18,345
An that desire that I had back
then, it's still with me today.

421
00:20:18,378 --> 00:20:21,412
If anything, it's
gotten stronger.

422
00:20:24,012 --> 00:20:25,845
I want to protect her.

423
00:20:25,878 --> 00:20:28,578
-Huh?

424
00:20:28,612 --> 00:20:29,112
-Tokiko?

425
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:29,978
I've decided.

426
00:20:32,912 --> 00:20:36,712
But I'm still lacking courage.

427
00:20:40,312 --> 00:20:41,578
-Really?

428
00:20:41,612 --> 00:20:45,078
In that case, then I'll make
up for what you're lacking.

429
00:20:45,112 --> 00:20:45,578
-Thanks.

430
00:20:48,178 --> 00:20:50,212
TOKIKO (VOICEOVER): It's
as I said that one night.

431
00:20:50,245 --> 00:20:54,112
When you die, I
will die with you.

432
00:20:54,145 --> 00:21:01,312
You and I are of
one mind and body.

433
00:21:01,345 --> 00:21:03,278
[beeping]

434
00:22:02,412 --> 00:22:04,378
[shout]

435
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,480
[theme music]

436
00:23:54,617 --> 00:23:56,317
TOKIKO (VOICEOVER):
Staking our final hopes

437
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:59,183
on one thing alone,
the white Kakugane.

438
00:23:59,217 --> 00:24:02,317
You head on to confront
Victor, but Kazuki, I

439
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:04,050
will not let you go alone.

440
00:24:04,083 --> 00:24:07,783
Next episode, When You
Die, I'll Die With You.

441
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:16,150
-Mahiro Muto's Buso
Renkin Seminar.

442
00:24:16,183 --> 00:24:17,083
Hello.

443
00:24:17,117 --> 00:24:18,950
This is Mahiro
Muto, and I'm here

444
00:24:18,983 --> 00:24:23,150
to introduce another
explosive set of Buso Renkin.

445
00:24:23,183 --> 00:24:25,350
Believe it or not,
for our eighth,

446
00:24:25,383 --> 00:24:27,583
we have the whole gang
from the Alchemist Army.

447
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:32,917
First up is this
guy Genja Ikusabe.

448
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:34,383
With a name difficult
to pronounce,

449
00:24:34,417 --> 00:24:36,683
it sounds like he
could be a samurai.

450
00:24:36,717 --> 00:24:41,317
Mr. Ikusabe weilds the Cross
Spear Buso Renkin Gekisen.

451
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:44,317
Its special property
is rapid regeneration.

452
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:47,083
In other words, even if
the spear and the wielder

453
00:24:47,117 --> 00:24:48,717
are damaged, it
will automatically

454
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:50,117
repair itself in an instant.

455
00:24:54,417 --> 00:24:56,983
Then we have Shinobu Negoro.

456
00:24:57,017 --> 00:25:00,517
Mr. Negoro wields the
Ninja Sword Buso Renkin,

457
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:02,150
Secret Trail.

458
00:25:02,183 --> 00:25:04,650
He says with this, he
can cut through objects

459
00:25:04,683 --> 00:25:08,483
to enter and exit
subspace at will.

460
00:25:08,517 --> 00:25:10,683
He comes out of the
darkness in stealth.

461
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:13,050
Now that's a ninja.

462
00:25:13,083 --> 00:25:15,983
Uh, by the way,
what's a subspace?

463
00:25:16,017 --> 00:25:21,417
Uh-- anyway, next we
have Rintaro Inukai.

464
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:24,883
Mr. Inukai's Buso
Renkin is a dog!

465
00:25:24,917 --> 00:25:26,750
Well, not exactly.

466
00:25:26,783 --> 00:25:30,750
It's a military dog style Buso
Renkin called Killer Rabies.

467
00:25:30,783 --> 00:25:34,183
But, well, I guess
it still is a dog.

468
00:25:34,217 --> 00:25:36,183
A dog type robot, that is.

469
00:25:36,217 --> 00:25:38,717
And it's way more
amazing than a real dog.

470
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:40,917
But when it comes to
real dogs, Mr. Inukai

471
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:43,183
is totally afraid of them!

472
00:25:43,217 --> 00:25:45,150
Ah, it makes no sense.

473
00:25:45,183 --> 00:25:46,017
Oh!

474
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:48,350
And then there's
Madoku Maruyama.

475
00:25:48,383 --> 00:25:50,817
The name and looks give
the impression of a woman,

476
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:54,283
but he is a full fledged man.

477
00:25:54,317 --> 00:25:56,850
Mr. Maruyama uses
a floating mine,

478
00:25:56,883 --> 00:26:01,217
an explosive Balloon Buso
Renkin called the Bubble Cage.

479
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:04,583
Each time the grotesque faced
balloons surround themselves

480
00:26:04,617 --> 00:26:07,283
around the target and explode,
the number of balloons

481
00:26:07,317 --> 00:26:09,750
increases and presses
down on the target!

482
00:26:09,783 --> 00:26:12,650
And then there's
Hanaka Busujima.

483
00:26:12,683 --> 00:26:16,750
She's really very cute, but
thanks to that bulky Gas Mask

484
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:19,317
Buso Renkin, called
Aerial Operator,

485
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:22,117
you can't see
Hanaka's true face.

486
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:24,817
With her Buso Renkin,
she can mix and create

487
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:27,383
all sorts of gas.

488
00:26:27,417 --> 00:26:30,483
But I still wanna see her face!

489
00:26:30,517 --> 00:26:34,583
And next, could it be
Bravo's girlfriend?

490
00:26:34,617 --> 00:26:35,550
Or, sort of.

491
00:26:35,583 --> 00:26:36,550
Maybe not.

492
00:26:36,583 --> 00:26:37,517
Who knows?

493
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:40,917
Well, her name is
Chitose Tateyama.

494
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:43,850
Miss Chitose's Buso Renkin
is the Hermes Drive.

495
00:26:43,883 --> 00:26:47,583
Taking the shape of a
radar, it can locate anyone,

496
00:26:47,617 --> 00:26:49,417
as long as she knows them.

497
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:52,283
Oh, and on top of
that, it also gives her

498
00:26:52,317 --> 00:26:53,783
the ability to teleport.

499
00:26:53,817 --> 00:26:57,883
And then there's Warrior
Chief Sekima Hiwatari.

500
00:26:57,917 --> 00:27:00,983
His Buso Renkin
is a napalm bomb,

501
00:27:01,017 --> 00:27:04,183
called Blaze of Glory,
capable of creating

502
00:27:04,217 --> 00:27:07,383
an instantaneous maximum
temperature of 10,000 degrees!

503
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:09,850
It can burn everything
in its path.

504
00:27:09,883 --> 00:27:10,817
Or so he says.

505
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:11,817
But 10,000 degrees!

506
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:12,850
Oh!

507
00:27:12,883 --> 00:27:15,250
Well, it must mean
it's very hot, right?

508
00:27:15,283 --> 00:27:17,250
And that's not all!

509
00:27:17,283 --> 00:27:19,417
There's his Pyro
Fusion, where he

510
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:21,117
can merge with that
super hot flame

511
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:23,817
to nullify the
opponent's attacks.

512
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:26,350
I'm saying this without really
knowing too much about it,

513
00:27:26,383 --> 00:27:27,717
though.

514
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:31,383
Anyway, last but not least, we
have the Great Warrior Chief

515
00:27:31,417 --> 00:27:33,017
Shosei Sakaguchi.

516
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:35,550
He sure doesn't go by the
title of Great Warrior

517
00:27:35,583 --> 00:27:37,083
Chief for nothing.

518
00:27:37,117 --> 00:27:41,183
His Buso Renkin is the
giant robot Buster Baron.

519
00:27:41,217 --> 00:27:43,750
What part of that
is Buso Renkin?

520
00:27:43,783 --> 00:27:46,983
That's just way over the top.

521
00:27:47,017 --> 00:27:50,050
The Buster Baron can even power
up other peoples' Buso Renkin,

522
00:27:50,083 --> 00:27:52,817
and use it for itself!

523
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:56,550
So, that's all the Buso Renkin
from the Alchemist Army.

524
00:27:56,583 --> 00:28:00,517
Well, next time is our final
one, so please tune in!

525
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:02,383
Okie dokie!
