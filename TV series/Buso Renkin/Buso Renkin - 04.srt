00:00:12,266 --> 00:00:14,466
NARRATOR: The supernatural
alloy produced

2
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:18,466
by gathering the essence
of alchemy is the Kakugane.

3
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:22,333
This device activates upon a
person's fighting instinct,

4
00:00:22,366 --> 00:00:26,166
manifesting the
possessor's inner power

5
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:30,166
into a tangible form, creating
a weapon like no other.

6
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,333
Its name, Buso Renkin.

[theme music]

8
00:02:16,715 --> 00:02:18,448
TOKIKO: So, you're
finally awake.

9
00:02:18,482 --> 00:02:18,948
-Wha--

10
00:02:22,815 --> 00:02:24,948
KAZUKI (VOICEOVER): I'm in
a hotel, in my underwear,

11
00:02:24,982 --> 00:02:26,648
and Tokiko's in casual clothes.

12
00:02:26,682 --> 00:02:28,682
What the hell is going on here?

13
00:02:35,582 --> 00:02:37,848
TOKIKO: You passed
out last night,

14
00:02:37,882 --> 00:02:39,715
so I just carried
you to the hotel

15
00:02:39,748 --> 00:02:42,515
where I'm staying, which
is closer than your dorm.

16
00:02:42,548 --> 00:02:44,748
Do you have any other
questions for me?

17
00:02:44,782 --> 00:02:47,348
-Nothing.

18
00:02:47,382 --> 00:02:48,348
Whoa.

19
00:02:48,382 --> 00:02:50,048
So you're staying
in place like this.

20
00:02:50,082 --> 00:02:51,982
It's just a bit unexpected.

21
00:02:52,015 --> 00:02:54,615
-Well, what did you think,
that I lived up in the clouds

22
00:02:54,648 --> 00:02:58,382
and survived on
mist or something?

23
00:02:58,415 --> 00:03:00,715
That is so rude of you!

24
00:03:00,748 --> 00:03:02,448
KAZUKI (VOICEOVER):
Come to think of it,

25
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:05,415
I don't know anything
about Tokiko.

26
00:03:05,448 --> 00:03:06,615
-Say.

27
00:03:06,648 --> 00:03:08,482
Where you go to school
and what grade are you in?

28
00:03:08,515 --> 00:03:10,982
-Why are you so interested
all of a sudden?

29
00:03:11,015 --> 00:03:12,548
I don't go to school at all.

30
00:03:12,582 --> 00:03:14,382
That uniform right
there is from a school

31
00:03:14,415 --> 00:03:17,215
I infiltrated during
my previous mission.

32
00:03:17,248 --> 00:03:19,548
If I were going to school
like everybody else,

33
00:03:19,582 --> 00:03:21,448
I'd be a senior this here.

34
00:03:21,482 --> 00:03:24,448
-Oh, so that means
you're older than me.

35
00:03:24,482 --> 00:03:26,348
-Does my age make you happy?

36
00:03:26,382 --> 00:03:27,348
-Uh.

37
00:03:27,382 --> 00:03:28,748
Wait a minute.

38
00:03:28,782 --> 00:03:30,115
So, why did you
become a warrior?

39
00:03:32,748 --> 00:03:35,048
-Because I hate all Homunculi.

40
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:38,582
Every single one.

41
00:03:38,615 --> 00:03:40,348
Enough with all these
silly questions.

42
00:03:40,382 --> 00:03:42,915
We should concentrate on
our search for the creator.

43
00:03:42,948 --> 00:03:45,148
And since today's Saturday,
we'll take the whole day.

44
00:03:45,182 --> 00:03:45,915
-Oh.

45
00:03:45,948 --> 00:03:47,315
Right.

46
00:03:47,348 --> 00:03:49,548
KAZUKI (VOICEOVER): I guess I
shouldn't have asked her that.

47
00:03:49,582 --> 00:03:51,582
I'm such an idiot.

48
00:03:51,615 --> 00:03:53,548
Tokiko is fighting those
man-eating monsters

49
00:03:53,582 --> 00:03:55,148
and protecting everyone.

50
00:03:55,182 --> 00:03:57,582
That's all I need
to know for now.

51
00:03:57,615 --> 00:04:00,615
What is really important is
that time is running out,

52
00:04:00,648 --> 00:04:02,848
and we only have two
days left to save her.

53
00:04:02,882 --> 00:04:06,815
That should be my top priority.

54
00:04:06,848 --> 00:04:07,948
-Now, listen.

55
00:04:07,982 --> 00:04:09,782
We haven't been able to
find the Papillon Masked

56
00:04:09,815 --> 00:04:13,348
Creator at school for the past
four days, which means whoever

57
00:04:13,382 --> 00:04:16,948
was absent during that time in
school becomes a prime suspect.

58
00:04:16,982 --> 00:04:20,382
And then there was a clue from
the Homunculus you defeated.

59
00:04:20,415 --> 00:04:22,482
-You guys are just too dumb.

60
00:04:22,515 --> 00:04:25,115
This school isn't the only
building on the campus that's--

61
00:04:25,148 --> 00:04:26,715
TOKIKO: He mentioned
a school facility

62
00:04:26,748 --> 00:04:30,348
that's not on the school
grounds, meaning-- the dorm.

63
00:04:30,382 --> 00:04:32,215
Kazuki, go to the dorm
and find the student

64
00:04:32,248 --> 00:04:34,148
who was absent from
school for four days.

65
00:04:34,182 --> 00:04:35,648
That'll narrow down our search.

66
00:04:35,682 --> 00:04:36,482
-Got it.

67
00:04:36,515 --> 00:04:37,548
And what are you going to do?

68
00:04:37,582 --> 00:04:39,015
-I'm going to sneak
into the school

69
00:04:39,048 --> 00:04:42,015
and check the attendance records
to see what I can find out.

70
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:42,782
-Oh, but--

71
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:44,015
-What is it now?

72
00:04:44,048 --> 00:04:46,082
-To be honest, it's
gonna kind of difficult

73
00:04:46,115 --> 00:04:48,415
just to go buy that description
mentioned in the note.

74
00:04:48,448 --> 00:04:49,482
-You think so?

75
00:04:49,515 --> 00:04:51,648
Then we should draw
a composite sketch.

76
00:04:51,682 --> 00:04:54,015
But I don't have any
drawing talent whatsoever.

77
00:04:54,048 --> 00:04:55,415
-Just leave that to me!

78
00:04:55,448 --> 00:04:58,848
As a matter of fact, I'm a true
master of composite sketches!

79
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:00,615
-You're just talking
without even thinking

80
00:05:00,648 --> 00:05:02,148
about what you're
saying, aren't you?

81
00:05:02,182 --> 00:05:03,715
-All right, here you go.

82
00:05:03,748 --> 00:05:04,882
-Amazing.

83
00:05:04,915 --> 00:05:06,948
But something doesn't
look quite right.

84
00:05:06,982 --> 00:05:08,648
All right, I'm counting on you.

85
00:05:08,682 --> 00:05:09,648
-You got it!

86
00:05:14,248 --> 00:05:15,982
I'm looking for this guy.

87
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:18,015
Have any of you have
seen him around?

88
00:05:18,048 --> 00:05:20,048
-What do you want from
a pervert like me?

89
00:05:20,082 --> 00:05:22,982
-By the way, where did you
stay last night, anyway?

90
00:05:23,015 --> 00:05:25,815
-More importantly, who the
heck is this Tokiko girl?

91
00:05:25,848 --> 00:05:26,582
-Ew.

92
00:05:26,615 --> 00:05:27,948
Looks like a super weirdo.

93
00:05:27,982 --> 00:05:29,982
-Hey, so what's the
deal with Okakura?

94
00:05:30,015 --> 00:05:30,948
-Well, that's because--

95
00:05:37,315 --> 00:05:40,215
-Does my age make you happy?

96
00:05:40,248 --> 00:05:41,382
-Pervert!

97
00:05:41,415 --> 00:05:43,182
-Who you talking about
being older, Kazuki?

98
00:05:43,215 --> 00:05:45,115
-Since we've got
nothing else to do,

99
00:05:45,148 --> 00:05:46,482
let's help look for this guy.

100
00:05:46,515 --> 00:05:47,848
-Sure, why not?

101
00:05:47,882 --> 00:05:50,615
-About 5' 9" to
5' 11" in height.

102
00:05:50,648 --> 00:05:52,448
Slim.

103
00:05:52,482 --> 00:05:53,382
Good posture.

104
00:05:53,415 --> 00:05:55,415
black hair, parted
in the middle.

105
00:05:55,448 --> 00:05:58,482
His skin is more on the
pale side rather than fair.

106
00:05:58,515 --> 00:06:00,015
-You'd think he's
be easy to find

107
00:06:00,048 --> 00:06:02,982
given such specific
characteristics.

108
00:06:03,015 --> 00:06:04,148
I don't know.

109
00:06:04,182 --> 00:06:05,682
Seems nobody knows him.

110
00:06:05,715 --> 00:06:07,615
-You don't think
this picture works?

111
00:06:07,648 --> 00:06:09,648
I put all of my effort
into each stroke.

112
00:06:09,682 --> 00:06:10,215
-Ah!

113
00:06:10,248 --> 00:06:11,582
Look over there.

114
00:06:11,615 --> 00:06:12,548
A green arm band.

115
00:06:12,582 --> 00:06:14,948
He's gotta be a senior student.

116
00:06:14,982 --> 00:06:15,915
Let's go ask him.

117
00:06:15,948 --> 00:06:16,882
Excuse me!

118
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:23,715
Do you mind if we
ask you a question?

119
00:06:23,748 --> 00:06:24,382
-Oh.

120
00:06:24,415 --> 00:06:25,515
Once second, please.

121
00:06:25,548 --> 00:06:27,282
Allow me to take my
medications first.

122
00:06:30,482 --> 00:06:32,748
KAZUKI: Whoa, he's
taking all of that?

123
00:06:32,782 --> 00:06:36,382
MAHIRO: Is it really OK for
you to take all of those?

124
00:06:36,415 --> 00:06:39,148
-No, of course it
isn't, but my body

125
00:06:39,182 --> 00:06:40,782
won't last if I
don't take them all.

126
00:06:40,815 --> 00:06:42,715
-Does that mean
you're in poor health?

127
00:06:42,748 --> 00:06:44,248
-You could say that.

128
00:06:44,282 --> 00:06:45,515
You wanted to ask me something?

129
00:06:45,548 --> 00:06:47,682
-Oh yeah, I forgot!

130
00:06:47,715 --> 00:06:49,215
You see, my brother
and I are looking

131
00:06:49,248 --> 00:06:50,882
for a male senior
student who was absent

132
00:06:50,915 --> 00:06:53,248
the past four days
up until yesterday.

133
00:06:53,282 --> 00:06:55,448
-So far, no matter
who we ask, the answer

134
00:06:55,482 --> 00:06:56,682
is, there's no such guy.

135
00:06:59,215 --> 00:07:00,415
-I see.

136
00:07:00,448 --> 00:07:03,715
So no such guy
exists, is that right?

137
00:07:03,748 --> 00:07:05,448
Well, if that's the
case, then I bet

138
00:07:05,482 --> 00:07:07,448
he's an invisible
presence to every one.

139
00:07:07,482 --> 00:07:09,615
MAHIRO: Invisible?

140
00:07:09,648 --> 00:07:11,482
BOY: Only perceived as
part of the background,

141
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:13,515
ignored by everyone.

142
00:07:13,548 --> 00:07:15,715
There's always someone
like that in every class.

143
00:07:15,748 --> 00:07:19,615
A person nobody cares about,
whether he's there or not.

144
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:21,015
That kind of presence.

145
00:07:24,748 --> 00:07:27,215
I feel so sorry for him.

146
00:07:27,248 --> 00:07:30,282
Is there anything else
you know about him?

147
00:07:30,315 --> 00:07:32,248
-A rough description
of his characteristics

148
00:07:32,282 --> 00:07:35,382
and this composite sketch.

149
00:07:35,415 --> 00:07:36,715
Magic in every single stroke!

150
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:38,882
-I guess such a person
doesn't exist after all.

151
00:07:38,915 --> 00:07:41,715
If he were, he'd be
some kind of loony, huh?

152
00:07:41,748 --> 00:07:42,982
-You think so?

153
00:07:43,015 --> 00:07:45,382
I actually think the mask
part is pretty darn cool.

154
00:07:45,415 --> 00:07:46,315
-Kazuki.

155
00:07:46,348 --> 00:07:47,348
Your definition of
cool is so lame!

156
00:07:47,382 --> 00:07:48,715
-No, he is correct!

157
00:07:48,748 --> 00:07:50,615
-Huh?

158
00:07:50,648 --> 00:07:53,348
-Yes. this mask is
quite brilliant.

159
00:07:53,382 --> 00:07:57,248
Butterflies are magnificent.

160
00:07:57,282 --> 00:07:59,482
From an ugly
caterpillar nobody cares

161
00:07:59,515 --> 00:08:03,315
about into a stunning
creature that one can't help

162
00:08:03,348 --> 00:08:05,782
but be drawn by its beauty.

163
00:08:05,815 --> 00:08:11,915
You see, this Papillon mask
represents a splendid symbol

164
00:08:11,948 --> 00:08:13,248
of transformation.

165
00:08:13,282 --> 00:08:15,515
TOKIKO (VOICEOVER): You'll
know by the look of his eyes.

166
00:08:15,548 --> 00:08:17,982
It's the color of
rotten river sewage.

167
00:08:18,015 --> 00:08:21,415
5'9 to 5'11 in height.

168
00:08:21,448 --> 00:08:23,148
Slim, good posture.

169
00:08:23,182 --> 00:08:24,915
Black hair parted in the middle.

170
00:08:24,948 --> 00:08:29,215
His skin is more on the
pale side, rather than fair.

171
00:08:29,248 --> 00:08:32,348
-Mahiro, what do you say
we go grab some lunch, OK?

172
00:08:32,382 --> 00:08:33,482
-Uh, mm-hm.

173
00:08:33,515 --> 00:08:35,215
-Why don't you go ahead
and wait the entrance

174
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:36,848
with Rokumasu and the others?

175
00:08:36,882 --> 00:08:38,348
-Oh, um, OK.

176
00:08:41,348 --> 00:08:42,448
KAZUKI: You know what?

177
00:08:42,482 --> 00:08:45,148
I've been living in this
dorm for the past year,

178
00:08:45,182 --> 00:08:49,048
but I don't remember ever
seeing your face before.

179
00:08:49,082 --> 00:08:50,648
-I told you.

180
00:08:50,682 --> 00:08:53,315
He is an invisible
presence to everyone,

181
00:08:53,348 --> 00:08:55,348
always just a part
of the background.

182
00:08:55,382 --> 00:08:59,815
And now there are only
two more days until--

183
00:08:59,848 --> 00:09:01,648
[coughing]

184
00:09:01,682 --> 00:09:04,415
[phone ringing]

185
00:09:04,448 --> 00:09:05,848
-I found him, Kazuki.

186
00:09:05,882 --> 00:09:07,882
There is indeed a senior
year boarding student

187
00:09:07,915 --> 00:09:09,848
who was absent for
four days straight.

188
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:14,148
Homeroom 3C, student number
eight, Koushaku Chouno, age 19.

189
00:09:14,182 --> 00:09:15,148
That's him.

190
00:09:15,182 --> 00:09:18,082
We've found the
Papillon Masked Creator.

191
00:09:18,115 --> 00:09:20,015
KOUSHAKU: The weak
caterpillar that can't even

192
00:09:20,048 --> 00:09:27,515
sustain its own life has found
awesome beauty on its own.

193
00:09:27,548 --> 00:09:30,782
The magnificent
power of alchemy.

194
00:09:30,815 --> 00:09:35,415
The means to a glorious
transformation!

195
00:09:35,448 --> 00:09:37,848
KAZUKI (VOICEOVER): This guy
is the Papillon Masked Creator

196
00:09:37,882 --> 00:09:39,182
himself.

197
00:09:39,215 --> 00:09:42,015
If I can catch him there,
there won't be anymore victims,

198
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:43,648
and Tokiko will be saved!

199
00:09:43,682 --> 00:09:45,315
TOKIKO: I'll be there
in five minutes.

200
00:09:45,348 --> 00:09:45,948
Wait for me.

201
00:09:48,815 --> 00:09:51,148
KAZUKI (VOICEOVER): I don't
know the extent of his power,

202
00:09:51,182 --> 00:09:53,982
but I'll get him
here no matter what.

203
00:09:54,015 --> 00:09:54,882
-Buso Ren--

204
00:09:54,915 --> 00:09:56,882
-That's far enough.

205
00:09:56,915 --> 00:09:57,548
-That's--

206
00:09:57,582 --> 00:09:58,482
-Correct.

207
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:00,715
The Homunculus embryo antidote.

208
00:10:00,748 --> 00:10:02,815
I made it for myself
in case of an accident

209
00:10:02,848 --> 00:10:04,282
during my experiments.

210
00:10:04,315 --> 00:10:05,548
A very rare item.

211
00:10:05,582 --> 00:10:07,082
The only one.

212
00:10:07,115 --> 00:10:09,348
I just completed the
final experiment now,

213
00:10:09,382 --> 00:10:11,282
so I don't need it anymore.

214
00:10:11,315 --> 00:10:13,082
However, without
this, your friend

215
00:10:13,115 --> 00:10:15,215
will turn into a
homunculus in two days.

216
00:10:15,248 --> 00:10:17,548
But you probably know
that by now, so what

217
00:10:17,582 --> 00:10:19,148
do you say we have a trade off?

218
00:10:19,182 --> 00:10:22,115
My antidote for your Kakugane?

219
00:10:22,148 --> 00:10:25,348
The other achievement of alchemy
along with the homunculus.

220
00:10:25,382 --> 00:10:27,382
I'd heard about it,
but after seeing it

221
00:10:27,415 --> 00:10:29,648
with my own eyes
the other day, it

222
00:10:29,682 --> 00:10:32,648
has drawn my interest as
the topic of research.

223
00:10:32,682 --> 00:10:34,015
So, what do you say?

224
00:10:34,048 --> 00:10:36,848
I guess if you don't need it,
I'll just dump it in the sewer.

225
00:10:36,882 --> 00:10:38,948
Even if you decide
you want it later,

226
00:10:38,982 --> 00:10:43,448
it takes time to produce, and
by then, it'll be too late.

227
00:10:43,482 --> 00:10:45,382
Now what will you do?

228
00:10:49,182 --> 00:10:51,048
-No.

229
00:10:51,082 --> 00:10:53,315
There's no way I'll
hand this over to you.

230
00:10:53,348 --> 00:10:54,748
-Just what I thought.

231
00:10:54,782 --> 00:10:56,648
No doubt if you were to
let go of your weapon,

232
00:10:56,682 --> 00:10:59,482
you would be at a
total disadvantage.

233
00:10:59,515 --> 00:11:00,582
I understand.

234
00:11:00,615 --> 00:11:02,548
I too value my life above all.

235
00:11:02,582 --> 00:11:03,515
That's not it.

236
00:11:03,548 --> 00:11:05,282
If I give up the
Kakugame, I'll die,

237
00:11:05,315 --> 00:11:07,582
which means I wouldn't be
able to deliver the antidote,

238
00:11:07,615 --> 00:11:09,348
even if I were to
get my hands on it.

239
00:11:09,382 --> 00:11:10,148
-What?

240
00:11:10,182 --> 00:11:11,882
What are you talking about?

241
00:11:11,915 --> 00:11:12,615
Explain.

242
00:11:12,648 --> 00:11:13,715
-I died once.

243
00:11:13,748 --> 00:11:16,748
A homunculus you created
stabbed me in the heart,

244
00:11:16,782 --> 00:11:18,448
killing me instantly.

245
00:11:18,482 --> 00:11:19,582
I was helpless.

246
00:11:19,615 --> 00:11:23,282
But then Tokiko replaced
my heart with a Kakugane

247
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:26,182
and brought me back to life.

248
00:11:26,215 --> 00:11:29,282
That's why this Kakugane
implanted in my chest

249
00:11:29,315 --> 00:11:30,282
is not only a weapon.

250
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:31,348
It's also my new life.

251
00:11:39,482 --> 00:11:40,648
-New life?

252
00:11:40,682 --> 00:11:41,948
A new life!

253
00:11:41,982 --> 00:11:43,048
That's remarkable.

254
00:11:43,082 --> 00:11:45,015
A Kakugane has such a power?

255
00:11:45,048 --> 00:11:47,882
You were able to obtain a
new life just like that,

256
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:50,182
and you didn't even work for it!

257
00:11:50,215 --> 00:11:52,248
[coughing]

258
00:11:52,282 --> 00:11:54,115
KAZUKI (VOICEOVER): This
guy is totally nuts.

259
00:11:54,148 --> 00:11:55,282
-Give it to me.

260
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:56,415
Give me new life.

261
00:11:56,448 --> 00:11:57,582
I deserve it!

262
00:11:57,615 --> 00:11:59,182
-You are responsible for this.

263
00:11:59,215 --> 00:12:02,248
The Homunculi you created
murdered so many people,

264
00:12:02,282 --> 00:12:04,515
and yet you still think
you deserve a new life.

265
00:12:04,548 --> 00:12:05,615
You're so selfish.

266
00:12:05,648 --> 00:12:06,615
I won't let this happen!

267
00:12:10,548 --> 00:12:13,848
I didn't mean to do that!

268
00:12:13,882 --> 00:12:15,948
Tokiko!

269
00:12:15,982 --> 00:12:18,215
That's the Homunculus
antidote in your hand.

270
00:12:18,248 --> 00:12:19,348
-No it's not.

271
00:12:19,382 --> 00:12:20,482
It's just a fake.

272
00:12:20,515 --> 00:12:22,315
It's not even a placebo.

273
00:12:22,348 --> 00:12:25,648
The real thing is a shot that's
injected into the embryo.

274
00:12:25,682 --> 00:12:26,982
-I totally fell for it.

275
00:12:27,015 --> 00:12:28,748
-Looks like you caught
the Papillon Masked

276
00:12:28,782 --> 00:12:29,748
Creator himself.

277
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:30,348
Good job.

278
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:31,615
-Yeah.

279
00:12:31,648 --> 00:12:33,248
But for someone who's
supposed to be the mastermind,

280
00:12:33,282 --> 00:12:35,415
he's pretty weak.

281
00:12:35,448 --> 00:12:37,015
-Well, of course he is.

282
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:40,248
He hasn't had any sort of formal
battle training like I have.

283
00:12:40,282 --> 00:12:42,882
Aside from the fact that he's
able to create Homunculi,

284
00:12:42,915 --> 00:12:45,448
he's just another human.

285
00:12:45,482 --> 00:12:48,048
I gathered his personal
record from the school.

286
00:12:48,082 --> 00:12:49,415
Koushaku Chouno.

287
00:12:49,448 --> 00:12:51,548
He's the eldest son of
a wealthy family that's

288
00:12:51,582 --> 00:12:54,282
operated a trade businesses
since the Meiji period.

289
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:56,915
He got a perfect 500
score on five subjects

290
00:12:56,948 --> 00:12:58,482
on his entrance examination.

291
00:12:58,515 --> 00:13:00,348
He has an IQ of 230.

292
00:13:00,382 --> 00:13:02,615
PAPILLON: And he would have
become the greatest genius

293
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:05,648
to attend this school
since it was founded.

294
00:13:05,682 --> 00:13:07,015
-What happened?

295
00:13:07,048 --> 00:13:08,848
-He came down with
an unknown disease

296
00:13:08,882 --> 00:13:11,082
just after entering school.

297
00:13:11,115 --> 00:13:12,515
There is no cure.

298
00:13:12,548 --> 00:13:14,715
His immune system
will eventually fail,

299
00:13:14,748 --> 00:13:17,282
and then he will die.

300
00:13:17,315 --> 00:13:18,882
He's been in and
out of hospitals

301
00:13:18,915 --> 00:13:21,082
and was held back
in school twice.

302
00:13:21,115 --> 00:13:24,115
He's been living in this room
like a recluse ever since.

303
00:13:24,148 --> 00:13:26,015
The other students
barely know him,

304
00:13:26,048 --> 00:13:29,382
and the teachers
have given up on him.

305
00:13:29,415 --> 00:13:30,482
See?

306
00:13:30,515 --> 00:13:35,348
Like I said before,
I feel sorry for him.

307
00:13:35,382 --> 00:13:37,182
-Let me ask you one thing.

308
00:13:37,215 --> 00:13:39,582
How exactly did you
learn about alchemy,

309
00:13:39,615 --> 00:13:42,582
and about the skills
needed to create Homunculi?

310
00:13:42,615 --> 00:13:45,782
-Based on research by my
great, great grandfather

311
00:13:45,815 --> 00:13:47,815
from over a half century ago.

312
00:13:47,848 --> 00:13:50,082
I found it in a
storage room in my home

313
00:13:50,115 --> 00:13:52,515
and spent three
years completing it.

314
00:13:52,548 --> 00:13:53,315
Hm.

315
00:13:53,348 --> 00:13:54,782
Remarkable, if I may say so.

316
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:56,382
-But why in the
world do you have

317
00:13:56,415 --> 00:13:58,948
to create all those
Homunculi monsters?

318
00:13:58,982 --> 00:14:01,182
-I already know what
his reasons are.

319
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:05,615
My suspicions were confirmed
soon after I discovered this.

320
00:14:05,648 --> 00:14:08,448
Up until now, they
were all prototypes.

321
00:14:08,482 --> 00:14:11,515
This 21st embryo is
the final product.

322
00:14:11,548 --> 00:14:15,148
He intends to use it to turn
himself into a homunculus.

323
00:14:15,182 --> 00:14:19,215
Even though a homunculus can be
destroyed with ordinary powers,

324
00:14:19,248 --> 00:14:22,282
slowly but surely, it
can regenerate itself,

325
00:14:22,315 --> 00:14:25,682
and having a strong body that
no power other than alchemy

326
00:14:25,715 --> 00:14:28,548
can affect is the closest
thing to achieving immortality

327
00:14:28,582 --> 00:14:30,448
in this world.

328
00:14:30,482 --> 00:14:33,848
His main goal is to discard
his diseased human body

329
00:14:33,882 --> 00:14:37,015
and obtain an immortal
Homunculus body.

330
00:14:37,048 --> 00:14:38,382
But isn't his
human mind supposed

331
00:14:38,415 --> 00:14:41,215
to die once The homunculus
embryo takes over?

332
00:14:41,248 --> 00:14:42,348
-That's right.

333
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:44,882
Mind would be killed and
the flesh taken away.

334
00:14:44,915 --> 00:14:47,948
However, there is one
Homunculus with an exception.

335
00:14:47,982 --> 00:14:48,882
-Indeed.

336
00:14:48,915 --> 00:14:51,715
The ultimate
humanoid Homunculus.

337
00:14:51,748 --> 00:14:54,715
Exactly what I've
been aiming for.

338
00:14:54,748 --> 00:14:58,382
This 21st embryo was made
with my own cells as a base.

339
00:14:58,415 --> 00:15:00,515
In other words, another me.

340
00:15:00,548 --> 00:15:03,315
If I fuse with myself, my
mind will remain intact

341
00:15:03,348 --> 00:15:05,882
and won't change, and this
body will get as close

342
00:15:05,915 --> 00:15:09,648
to immortal as you
can get in this world.

343
00:15:09,682 --> 00:15:12,248
Animal types and plant
types are mere monsters

344
00:15:12,282 --> 00:15:16,882
but this humanoid Homunculus
will be super human.

345
00:15:16,915 --> 00:15:19,448
-But that means you'll
still be a homunculus

346
00:15:19,482 --> 00:15:22,815
and still eat people.

347
00:15:22,848 --> 00:15:25,748
You're willing to become
a monster just to live?

348
00:15:25,782 --> 00:15:28,615
Is that really a rewarding
way to become immortal?

349
00:15:28,648 --> 00:15:30,082
-I want to live.

350
00:15:30,115 --> 00:15:33,315
I told you before, I
value my life above all,

351
00:15:33,348 --> 00:15:35,315
and I'll do whatever
it takes to live.

352
00:15:35,348 --> 00:15:36,115
What about you?

353
00:15:36,148 --> 00:15:38,082
Didn't you die once already?

354
00:15:38,115 --> 00:15:40,482
And last time, you
chose your own life,

355
00:15:40,515 --> 00:15:42,915
just as I would have done.

356
00:15:42,948 --> 00:15:44,648
That's because you
wanted to live,

357
00:15:44,682 --> 00:15:46,282
but you should have
been dead already.

358
00:15:46,315 --> 00:15:48,882
You came back to life
with absolutely no effort,

359
00:15:48,915 --> 00:15:51,082
and now you're telling
me to die like this?

360
00:15:51,115 --> 00:15:53,348
How dare you tell me to
just accept my illness

361
00:15:53,382 --> 00:15:54,682
and simply die?

362
00:15:54,715 --> 00:15:56,482
-Just go to hell.

363
00:15:56,515 --> 00:15:59,182
You won't be able to become
a superhuman, anyway.

364
00:15:59,215 --> 00:16:01,348
I'm going to destroy
this thing right now.

365
00:16:01,382 --> 00:16:02,215
-No!

366
00:16:02,248 --> 00:16:03,748
In two days, it'll
be all finished!

367
00:16:03,782 --> 00:16:05,848
-I can finally transform
myself from a caterpillar

368
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:06,948
to a butterfly!

369
00:16:06,982 --> 00:16:11,415
That's my new life!

370
00:16:11,448 --> 00:16:12,382
-What is that?

371
00:16:12,415 --> 00:16:13,882
-That must be it again.

372
00:16:13,915 --> 00:16:15,382
The last one, the
Hawk Homunculus.

373
00:16:26,513 --> 00:16:27,980
It's coming back!

374
00:16:32,446 --> 00:16:34,413
-Master, are you all right?

375
00:16:37,646 --> 00:16:39,280
Alchemist Warriors.

376
00:16:39,313 --> 00:16:41,380
How dare you attack my master!

377
00:16:41,413 --> 00:16:43,946
-It seems the
tables have turned.

378
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,413
Ha ha ha!

379
00:16:45,446 --> 00:16:47,913
Now you will turn into
a monster and die!

380
00:16:47,946 --> 00:16:50,346
And I'll be a superhuman
and live forever!

381
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:51,580
Ha ha!

382
00:16:51,613 --> 00:16:54,680
-Be it monster or superhuman,
I'll stop them both!

383
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:56,946
-So you're going to stop me?

384
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,046
I see.

385
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,580
Well, I guess you're
implying that you just

386
00:16:59,613 --> 00:17:01,146
want me to die
miserably like this.

387
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,346
-That's not it.

388
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,213
I would never say something
like that to anyone.

389
00:17:04,246 --> 00:17:06,880
I'm saying make amends to
all the people you sacrificed

390
00:17:06,913 --> 00:17:09,646
already, and then live until the
end of your life like everyone

391
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,480
else.

392
00:17:11,513 --> 00:17:14,346
-Master, please don't
waste your precious time,

393
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,146
and just leave this to me.

394
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:18,413
-We don't have any
time to argue, Kazuki.

395
00:17:18,446 --> 00:17:20,980
People will be here soon.

396
00:17:21,013 --> 00:17:21,946
-What happened?

397
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:22,480
-Did you see?

398
00:17:22,513 --> 00:17:25,946
-I don't know.

399
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,313
-Was that an explosion up there?

400
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:28,380
-Where is Kazuki?

401
00:17:28,413 --> 00:17:30,513
I don't see him anywhere.

402
00:17:30,546 --> 00:17:31,280
-What?

403
00:17:31,313 --> 00:17:32,280
-All right.

404
00:17:32,313 --> 00:17:34,446
You go catch the
Papillon Masked Creator.

405
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,813
I'll go after Washio.

406
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:36,913
-But why?

407
00:17:36,946 --> 00:17:38,513
-If he's just attacking
from that distance,

408
00:17:38,546 --> 00:17:39,913
then my lance should be faster.

409
00:17:39,946 --> 00:17:41,546
It should hit the
target in a flash.

410
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:44,046
-How dare you even think
you can challenge my speed?

411
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,513
TOKIKO (VOICEOVER):
Kazuki's right.

412
00:17:45,546 --> 00:17:47,580
It'd be different up in the
air, but in this small space,

413
00:17:47,613 --> 00:17:50,080
Kazuki's able to make the first
strike before the Homunculus

414
00:17:50,113 --> 00:17:51,413
completes his transformation.

415
00:17:51,446 --> 00:17:51,946
-All right.

416
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:52,846
Let's go.

417
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,646
-Buso--

418
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,113
-You've made a grave mistake.

419
00:17:57,146 --> 00:17:59,313
Prepare to die.

420
00:17:59,346 --> 00:18:00,746
PAPILLON: The
embryos up until now

421
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,580
were all a product of
animal experimentation

422
00:18:02,613 --> 00:18:05,213
in order to obtain my dream.

423
00:18:05,246 --> 00:18:08,113
They were simply part of
the quest for my new life.

424
00:18:08,146 --> 00:18:11,080
But this Hawk Homunculus
was the exception.

425
00:18:11,113 --> 00:18:14,146
He's of a different breed
from the ones you've fought.

426
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:21,513
MAHIRO (VOICEOVER):
What was that?

427
00:18:21,546 --> 00:18:24,380
I've got kind of a bad
feeling about this.

428
00:18:24,413 --> 00:18:25,880
BOY: Is everyone all right?

429
00:18:25,913 --> 00:18:29,313
BOY: Somebody call the cops!

430
00:18:29,346 --> 00:18:31,080
-I'm saying, make
amends to all the people

431
00:18:31,113 --> 00:18:32,813
you've sacrificed
already, and then

432
00:18:32,846 --> 00:18:36,080
live until the end of your
life, like everyone else.

433
00:18:36,113 --> 00:18:38,946
-Oh, self righteous hypocrites.

434
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,813
That's the type I hate the most.

435
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,946
Here I go again.

436
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:49,246
I've lost another
place I called home.

437
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,813
Now where am I supposed to
go for the next two days?

438
00:18:55,946 --> 00:18:59,246
KAZUKI (VOICEOVER): I
can't breathe at this rate.

439
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,680
-Hey Tokiko!

440
00:19:00,713 --> 00:19:01,646
-I know.

441
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,413
I'm ready.

442
00:19:02,446 --> 00:19:03,313
Let's go!

443
00:19:03,346 --> 00:19:04,246
TOGETHER: Buso Renkin!

444
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,613
-Tokiko!

445
00:19:21,646 --> 00:19:22,313
-I'm OK.

446
00:19:22,346 --> 00:19:23,613
Just give me your hand.

447
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,246
We're going to land.

448
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,180
It's going to be a bit
of a challenge supporting

449
00:19:34,213 --> 00:19:37,013
the weight of two people
with the Valkyrie Skirt,

450
00:19:37,046 --> 00:19:39,046
so get ready and brace yourself.

451
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:39,946
-Hold on.

452
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:40,846
I'll take care of it.

453
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,180
-Huh?

454
00:19:42,213 --> 00:19:43,280
KAZUKI (VOICEOVER): The special
property of my Buso Renkin

455
00:19:43,313 --> 00:19:44,613
lance is this ornamental cloth.

456
00:19:44,646 --> 00:19:47,946
It becomes energy and
activates according to my will.

457
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:50,446
-Burst through, my Buso Renkin!

458
00:19:58,446 --> 00:20:00,380
TOKIKO (VOICEOVER): With
energy from the cloth,

459
00:20:00,413 --> 00:20:02,713
he was able to soften
the impact of our fall.

460
00:20:02,746 --> 00:20:06,046
As I suspected, this Buso
Renkin is very powerful.

461
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,080
And even though it's been
a very gradual process,

462
00:20:08,113 --> 00:20:10,113
Kazuki is certainly
starting to masters its use.

463
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,413
-That was really close.

464
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:17,480
-Very impressive powers.

465
00:20:17,513 --> 00:20:21,880
Just what I'd expect of
an alchemist warrior.

466
00:20:21,913 --> 00:20:23,013
-Look He's different.

467
00:20:23,046 --> 00:20:24,713
He's only half homunculus.

468
00:20:24,746 --> 00:20:26,080
-Now I get it.

469
00:20:26,113 --> 00:20:28,946
This way his transformation
and attacks are much quicker.

470
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:31,413
It appears he's on a
completely different level.

471
00:20:31,446 --> 00:20:33,846
-I'm trembling with excitement.

472
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,680
Having you two as
my opponents, I

473
00:20:35,713 --> 00:20:39,146
should be able to display
my power to its full extent.

474
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,913
-The last one of the Homunculi.

475
00:20:40,946 --> 00:20:42,780
-If we defeat him,
the only one left

476
00:20:42,813 --> 00:20:44,080
is the Papillon Masked Creator.

477
00:20:44,113 --> 00:20:47,913
-I will destroy anyone who
would do harm to my master.

478
00:20:47,946 --> 00:20:48,613
-Here we go!

479
00:20:51,813 --> 00:20:53,346
-I'll chop your wings off!

480
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,313
-I know.

481
00:20:55,346 --> 00:20:56,780
TOKIKO (VOICEOVER): It's hard.

482
00:20:56,813 --> 00:20:58,546
Wait a minute, this must be--

483
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:01,846
-No matter how swift the blade,
if its angle is not erect,

484
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,180
it will be impossible to cut!

485
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:06,480
KAZUKI: Tokiko!

486
00:21:06,513 --> 00:21:08,580
Dodge!

487
00:21:08,613 --> 00:21:09,546
Energy release!

488
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:10,513
Take this!

489
00:21:10,546 --> 00:21:11,480
Jousting Slasher!

490
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:15,846
TOKIKO: Did he miss?

491
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,380
Oh, no.

492
00:21:16,413 --> 00:21:17,780
This means--

493
00:21:17,813 --> 00:21:19,246
-I know.

494
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:23,113
Your lance may be sharp, but if
the tip is shifted even a bit,

495
00:21:23,146 --> 00:21:24,946
I can easily dodge it.

496
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:25,846
-I don't think so.

497
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,180
It's not over yet!

498
00:21:27,213 --> 00:21:28,446
-Get him!

499
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,313
-I've grasped both of
your attack speeds by now.

500
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,713
I know.

501
00:21:34,746 --> 00:21:38,446
This is what I call
reading the enemy's attack.

502
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,813
TOKIKO (VOICEOVER):
This monster--

503
00:21:39,846 --> 00:21:42,746
he's definitely at a
different level than the ones

504
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,280
we've had to fight before.

505
00:21:44,313 --> 00:21:45,313
-He's coming.

506
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:46,280
Let's go!

507
00:21:54,589 --> 00:21:59,023
[theme music]

508
00:23:24,459 --> 00:23:26,392
TOKIKO: The fifth day is over.

509
00:23:26,426 --> 00:23:28,359
Only one day remains.

510
00:23:28,392 --> 00:23:30,326
Once you leave tomorrow
morning, then I

511
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:32,759
shall end my life
by my own hands.

512
00:23:32,792 --> 00:23:35,526
Next time, To Protect Someone.

513
00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:38,559
I'll splatter your guts!
