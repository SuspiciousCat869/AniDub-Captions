00:00:14,533 --> 00:00:18,866
by gathering the essence
of alchemy is the Kakugane.

00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,733
This device activates upon a
person's fighting instinct,

4
00:00:22,766 --> 00:00:25,466
manifesting the
possessor's inner power

5
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,100
into a tangible form, creating
a weapon like no other.

00:00:30,133 --> 00:00:32,366
Its name, Buso Renkin.

00:02:23,842 --> 00:02:25,775
-Let's get out to

10
00:02:25,808 --> 00:02:26,442
-All right.

11
00:02:26,475 --> 00:02:28,475
-Don't think so.

12
00:02:28,508 --> 00:02:29,775
-Take this!

13
00:02:29,808 --> 00:02:30,375
Jousting Flash!

14
00:02:39,108 --> 00:02:41,608
-The boy is skillful
and perceptive.

15
00:02:41,642 --> 00:02:43,375
He's quite impressive.

16
00:02:43,408 --> 00:02:48,475
However, he is still
very inexperienced.

17
00:02:48,508 --> 00:02:49,642
And then there's that girl.

18
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:54,975
Compared to her
moves the other day,

19
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:58,308
she now appears to
be rather sluggish.

20
00:02:58,342 --> 00:02:59,408
I can win.

21
00:02:59,442 --> 00:03:02,375
I will win, for the
sake of my master, who

22
00:03:02,408 --> 00:03:03,808
gave me life and power.

23
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:18,175
[heavy breathing]

24
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:20,475
-Valkyrie Skirt, standby mode.

25
00:03:26,008 --> 00:03:27,208
-Whoa, that's cool.

26
00:03:27,242 --> 00:03:29,808
Just what I'd expect
from the Valkyrie Skirt.

27
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:31,642
-I don't really know
what you mean by that,

28
00:03:31,675 --> 00:03:33,408
but if you gain
experience, you'll

29
00:03:33,442 --> 00:03:35,908
also be able to do
all sorts of things.

30
00:03:35,942 --> 00:03:36,408
Hm.

31
00:03:40,475 --> 00:03:42,508
Anyway, wipe off the blood.

32
00:03:42,542 --> 00:03:45,642
Our battle is
definitely not over yet.

33
00:03:45,675 --> 00:03:46,775
-Thanks.

34
00:03:46,808 --> 00:03:48,608
Are you OK, Tokiko?

35
00:03:48,642 --> 00:03:52,775
-Well, actually, my right
shoulder's a little--

36
00:03:52,808 --> 00:03:54,242
-Tokiko?

37
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:55,142
-I'm OK.

38
00:03:55,175 --> 00:03:57,375
It's really not a big deal.

39
00:03:57,408 --> 00:03:59,608
-Don't push yourself too much.

40
00:03:59,642 --> 00:04:01,575
-Look who's talking.

41
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:03,442
Who do you think I am?

42
00:04:03,475 --> 00:04:06,375
-An Alchemist Warrior
who's stronger than I am.

43
00:04:06,408 --> 00:04:09,775
But if it's important, then
I definitely speak my mind.

44
00:04:09,808 --> 00:04:12,175
-I see.

45
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:13,208
All right, then.

46
00:04:13,242 --> 00:04:14,675
I'll be more careful.

47
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:16,975
But now is the time for battle!

48
00:04:17,008 --> 00:04:19,275
About that hawk
type, it's obvious

49
00:04:19,308 --> 00:04:20,875
that it's in a whole
different league

50
00:04:20,908 --> 00:04:22,375
than the other Homunculi.

51
00:04:22,408 --> 00:04:24,675
His ability to use
those wings as a defense

52
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:26,375
is not a technique
that came naturally.

53
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:31,175
-I've found you!

54
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:32,142
-He's here!

55
00:04:32,175 --> 00:04:33,075
-Just one.

56
00:04:33,108 --> 00:04:34,775
So they've split up, huh?

57
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:36,175
-Listen up, Kazuki.

58
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:38,775
The hawk wing defense
is indeed superb.

59
00:04:38,808 --> 00:04:40,975
However, it's not perfect.

60
00:04:41,008 --> 00:04:42,942
When we attacked
simultaneously, he

61
00:04:42,975 --> 00:04:45,208
used his claws, not his wings.

62
00:04:45,242 --> 00:04:46,942
His wing defense
can't completely

63
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:50,775
handle the succession
of attacks.

64
00:04:50,808 --> 00:04:54,842
There's one thing that will
work-- a high speed multiple

65
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:56,408
attack.

66
00:04:56,442 --> 00:04:58,742
One of us becomes the
decoy, and the other

67
00:04:58,775 --> 00:05:01,275
delivers the finishing blow.

68
00:05:01,308 --> 00:05:02,108
-All right.

69
00:05:02,142 --> 00:05:03,908
I'll be the decoy.

70
00:05:03,942 --> 00:05:07,642
If I use my lance and combine
the slasher and flash attack,

71
00:05:07,675 --> 00:05:09,042
then I should be
able to keep you

72
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:12,075
hidden until the last second.

73
00:05:12,108 --> 00:05:13,175
Here I go.

MAHIRO: No.

77
00:05:23,642 --> 00:05:24,908
He's not here.

78
00:05:24,942 --> 00:05:26,675
BOY: He wasn't at
the school, either.

79
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:28,908
-It seems he was
with Tokiko before he

80
00:05:28,942 --> 00:05:30,308
was supposed to meet up with us.

81
00:05:30,342 --> 00:05:30,808
-What?

82
00:05:30,842 --> 00:05:32,008
Her again?

83
00:05:32,042 --> 00:05:33,008
-Yeah.

84
00:05:33,042 --> 00:05:34,742
Ever since Tokiko
showed up, Kazuki

85
00:05:34,775 --> 00:05:36,975
keeps on disappearing
all the time.

86
00:05:37,008 --> 00:05:40,275
-Well, I'm sure glad to
hear he's OK, though.

87
00:05:40,308 --> 00:05:44,375
-Dammit, I'll teach him a
lesson tonight for sure.

88
00:05:44,408 --> 00:05:45,608
MAHIRO (VOICEOVER): Kazuki.

89
00:05:45,642 --> 00:05:47,642
I don't need to worry
about you-- right?

90
00:05:47,675 --> 00:05:49,408
-There's one th that'll work.

91
00:05:49,442 --> 00:05:51,242
A high speed multiple attack.

92
00:05:51,275 --> 00:05:53,242
One of us becomes the
decoy, and the other

93
00:05:53,275 --> 00:05:56,608
delivers the finishing blow!

94
00:05:56,642 --> 00:05:59,575
Hide in the light and
follow me, Tokiko.

-Valkyrie Skirt!

96
00:06:06,175 --> 00:06:08,575
A beautiful golden light.

00:06:08,608 --> 00:06:12,408
It's like sunlight.

Something's different.

101
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:18,775
-The wind has changed
from the earlier attack.

102
00:06:18,808 --> 00:06:23,008
-He reads the wind with his
wings, not just his eyes.

103
00:06:23,042 --> 00:06:25,542
-There's a slightly different
wind mixed in this time.

104
00:06:28,108 --> 00:06:29,142
Now I see it.

105
00:06:29,175 --> 00:06:31,575
The girl is hidden
behind the light.

106
00:06:31,608 --> 00:06:33,708
With these claws, I'll take
care of the both of you

107
00:06:33,742 --> 00:06:34,775
at the same time!

00:06:34,808 --> 00:06:35,408
-Tokiko!

00:06:35,442 --> 00:06:36,742
He figured it out!

Run!

-Kazuki, don't stop!

-I was careless letting
you get above me twice,

00:06:45,175 --> 00:06:46,808
but I won't lose!

114

Tokiko!

122
00:07:10,408 --> 00:07:11,875
Why did you do that?

123
00:07:11,908 --> 00:07:14,042
-He figured out our plan.

124
00:07:14,075 --> 00:07:15,942
So I changed it.

125
00:07:15,975 --> 00:07:21,842
But-- argh.

126
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:27,608
-It's probably the last
chance I had to give my all.

127
00:07:27,642 --> 00:07:29,975
It's finally risen up my spine.

128
00:07:34,275 --> 00:07:38,642
And my body movements are
gradually getting slower.

129
00:07:38,675 --> 00:07:43,075
I didn't want to miss this
chance, so I attacked.

130
00:07:43,108 --> 00:07:43,975
But--

131
00:07:44,008 --> 00:07:46,708
-You're a dangerous woman.

132
00:07:46,742 --> 00:07:48,775
And that tenacity
of yours will surely

133
00:07:48,808 --> 00:07:51,375
mean trouble for my master,
even if you will eventually

134
00:07:51,408 --> 00:07:53,042
become a Homunculus.

135
00:07:53,075 --> 00:07:55,975
So I must finish you
off once and for all.

136
00:07:56,008 --> 00:07:58,008
-It seems that one
more blow is necessary.

137
00:08:01,842 --> 00:08:03,742
-Leave this to me.

138
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:05,675
You rest, Tokiko.

139
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:14,475
From here on-- I'm going
to fight by myself.

140
00:08:14,508 --> 00:08:17,942
I'll beat this guy, catch
the Papillon Masked Creator,

141
00:08:17,975 --> 00:08:20,942
destroy the 21st embryo,
and get the antidote.

142
00:08:20,975 --> 00:08:22,775
-There's no point
in acting tough.

143
00:08:22,808 --> 00:08:25,775
Don't you think I know that
the one with inferior fighting

144
00:08:25,808 --> 00:08:29,775
skills is usually the decoy?

145
00:08:29,808 --> 00:08:32,375
I will take care
of you later, boy.

146
00:08:32,408 --> 00:08:35,175
Right now the girl
is my top priority.

147
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:36,708
-Back off, Kazuki.

148
00:08:36,742 --> 00:08:37,742
Listen to me right now.

149
00:08:37,775 --> 00:08:39,675
You're still no match for him.

150
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:40,875
-Step aside.

151
00:08:40,908 --> 00:08:42,775
-I will not.

00:08:42,808 --> 00:08:43,275
-Fine!

153
00:08:48,542 --> 00:08:50,142
-I will not!

154
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:52,142

me to, I'm not

I missed him again!

you try, it's useless.

I am able to read the
wind with my wing.

163
00:09:26,304 --> 00:09:29,304
Instead of looking with my
eyes or listening with my ears,

164
00:09:29,338 --> 00:09:32,804
the wind can tell me everything.

No matter what the
situation, my wing defense

166

will never fail me!

00:09:36,838 --> 00:09:38,604
Prepare to die.

168
00:09:38,638 --> 00:09:40,538
WASHIO (VOICEOVER):
Something seems different.

169
00:09:40,571 --> 00:09:42,538
The wind has changed slightly.

170
00:09:42,571 --> 00:09:44,838
A far cry from a
gale or a typhoon,

171
00:09:44,871 --> 00:09:47,038
but I still sense a change.

172
00:09:47,071 --> 00:09:48,871
Even though he is
still inexperienced,

173
00:09:48,904 --> 00:09:51,938
I can feel his
powerful breath now.

174
00:09:51,971 --> 00:09:53,838
The reason must be--

175
00:09:53,871 --> 00:09:55,471
TOKIKO (VOICEOVER):
This Homunculus--

176
00:09:55,504 --> 00:09:58,738
even if he only has
one arm or one wing,

177
00:09:58,771 --> 00:10:01,638
his defense is as
impregnable as ever.

178
00:10:01,671 --> 00:10:05,804
Kazuki can't do this alone.

179
00:10:05,838 --> 00:10:08,438
-Tokiko, stay out of this.

180
00:10:08,471 --> 00:10:09,871
Here I come!

181
00:10:09,904 --> 00:10:14,238
[shout]

182
00:10:14,271 --> 00:10:17,438
-That girl there--
tell me, is she really

183
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:20,471
that important to you?

184
00:10:20,504 --> 00:10:24,004
Is it a simple relationship
based on skill hierarchy?

185
00:10:24,038 --> 00:10:25,171
Or is it more than that?

186
00:10:25,204 --> 00:10:27,171
Are you two a couple?

187
00:10:27,204 --> 00:10:29,338
-I owe Tokiko my life.

188
00:10:29,371 --> 00:10:33,371
I died once, and she
gave me a new life.

189
00:10:33,404 --> 00:10:34,704
Now her life is on the line.

190
00:10:34,738 --> 00:10:35,804
I owe her!

191
00:10:35,838 --> 00:10:37,338
No way I'm going to lose to you!

192
00:10:37,371 --> 00:10:39,871
-You and I are the same.

193
00:10:39,904 --> 00:10:42,604
I too owe my life to my master.

194
00:10:45,404 --> 00:10:48,038
Before getting this
body, I was a bird.

195
00:10:48,071 --> 00:10:49,304
A wild hawk.

196
00:10:49,338 --> 00:10:53,604
The ultimate bird of prey,
the champion of the skies.

197
00:10:53,638 --> 00:10:55,871
The strongest of them all.

198
00:10:55,904 --> 00:11:01,738
However-- [gunshot]
I was shot-- either

199
00:11:01,771 --> 00:11:06,004
by accident, or by poachers.

200
00:11:06,038 --> 00:11:08,271
KOUSHAKU: Oh, what a pity.

201
00:11:08,304 --> 00:11:11,504
Well, this is how life goes.

202
00:11:11,538 --> 00:11:14,504
Whether it's a protected species
or not, once you're dead,

203
00:11:14,538 --> 00:11:16,471
you're dead.

204
00:11:16,504 --> 00:11:19,004
But to think I'd come out here
to catch a few butterflies,

205
00:11:19,038 --> 00:11:22,071
and ended up finding
something so rare.

206
00:11:22,104 --> 00:11:25,871
You and I are both
very, very lucky.

207
00:11:25,904 --> 00:11:27,171
Rejoice now.

208
00:11:27,204 --> 00:11:29,204
I'm going to bring
you back to life.

209
00:11:29,238 --> 00:11:33,038
WASHIO: And then
I was resurrected.

210
00:11:33,071 --> 00:11:35,838
I owe my life to my master.

211
00:11:35,871 --> 00:11:39,704
I died once, and he gave
me new life and power.

212
00:11:39,738 --> 00:11:44,971
Now his life is on the line, and
I won't allow you to interfere!

213
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:46,238
TOKIKO (VOICEOVER): No wonder.

214
00:11:46,271 --> 00:11:49,104
His battle skills-- they
come from the instincts

215
00:11:49,138 --> 00:11:50,571
of a wild animal.

216
00:11:50,604 --> 00:11:51,871
-I see.

217
00:11:51,904 --> 00:11:53,638
You and I are the same.

218
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:58,371
However, our benefactors
are totally different.

219
00:11:58,404 --> 00:12:00,971
Chouno sees all of
you as guinea pigs.

220
00:12:01,004 --> 00:12:02,771
He tramples upon
the lives of others,

221
00:12:02,804 --> 00:12:04,504
thinking only about himself.

222
00:12:04,538 --> 00:12:08,604
Constantly running away
from his fear of death.

223
00:12:08,638 --> 00:12:11,271
What Chouno's doing is
completely wrong, and thanks

224
00:12:11,304 --> 00:12:11,771
to him--

225
00:12:11,804 --> 00:12:14,371
-Silence!

226
00:12:14,404 --> 00:12:15,438
-Kazuki!

227
00:12:15,471 --> 00:12:17,171
WASHIO: Isn't it the
nature of all living

228
00:12:17,204 --> 00:12:18,938
beings to fear of death?

229
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:21,904
Having lived in the wild,
I relate to this very well.

230
00:12:21,938 --> 00:12:25,171
There is nothing wrong
in my master's actions.

231
00:12:25,204 --> 00:12:27,938
Truth is, you don't want
to die like this, either.

232
00:12:27,971 --> 00:12:29,304
Admit it.

233
00:12:29,338 --> 00:12:31,871
If you pledge never to have
anything to do with my master

234
00:12:31,904 --> 00:12:34,638
again, I could let this
slide, and let you go.

235
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:38,104
There is nothing shameful
or evil in fearing death,

236
00:12:38,138 --> 00:12:41,538
and running away from it.

237
00:12:41,571 --> 00:12:44,538
-You see, if I run
away, then someone else

238
00:12:44,571 --> 00:12:47,771
will die in my place.

239
00:12:47,804 --> 00:12:49,638
There's no way I will back down.

240
00:12:49,671 --> 00:12:51,171
No way I will lose.

241
00:12:51,204 --> 00:12:53,204
No way I will let
Tokiko die in my place!

242
00:12:53,238 --> 00:12:54,971
TOKIKO (VOICEOVER):
He's wrapping the cloth

243
00:12:55,004 --> 00:12:56,404
around the tip of his lance.

244
00:12:56,438 --> 00:13:00,204
In that state, he can use
the energy of the cloth,

245
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:04,138
not just for charging power, but
for destructive power as well.

246
00:13:04,171 --> 00:13:05,104
But that will--

247
00:13:05,138 --> 00:13:06,071
-You're right.

248
00:13:06,104 --> 00:13:07,671
Death is a frightening thing.

249
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:10,038
I know since I've
died once already,

250
00:13:10,071 --> 00:13:13,538
and Chouno knows it because
he's facing death right now.

251
00:13:13,571 --> 00:13:16,804
But you see, Chouno and
I are both human beings.

252
00:13:16,838 --> 00:13:19,638
That's why there are things
that must not be done,

253
00:13:19,671 --> 00:13:23,438
and things that must
be done even if we die!

254
00:13:23,471 --> 00:13:26,438
-At this rate, he's going
to hurt himself as well.

255
00:13:26,471 --> 00:13:27,771
Stop, Kazuki!

256
00:13:27,804 --> 00:13:31,671
-Here comes energy full blast!

257
00:13:31,704 --> 00:13:32,638
Jousting Crasher!

258
00:13:35,604 --> 00:13:38,938
[scream]

259
00:13:47,304 --> 00:13:52,104
WASHIO: So the breeze has
turned into a real wind.

260
00:13:52,138 --> 00:13:59,504
I know it's selfish,
but I have one request.

261
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:00,938
My master--

262
00:14:05,004 --> 00:14:06,471
-I won't kill him.

263
00:14:06,504 --> 00:14:10,938
That's not my-- my intention.

264
00:14:10,971 --> 00:14:13,704
I'll just stop him.

265
00:14:13,738 --> 00:14:17,771
-Having heard that,
now I can die in peace.

266
00:14:20,638 --> 00:14:22,904
WASHIO (VOICEOVER):
Die in peace?

267
00:14:25,838 --> 00:14:30,204
I never knew there
was such a death.

268
00:14:33,338 --> 00:14:34,804
TOKIKO (VOICEOVER):
Although he said

269
00:14:34,838 --> 00:14:37,604
it was the nature of living
beings to fear death,

270
00:14:37,638 --> 00:14:39,538
he still sacrificed
his life fighting

271
00:14:39,571 --> 00:14:41,704
for the Papillon Masked Creator.

272
00:14:41,738 --> 00:14:44,671
He was a unique Homunculus
until the very end,

273
00:14:44,704 --> 00:14:47,271
and it turned out to be a
good experience for Kazuki

274
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:48,438
after all.

275
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:50,804
It's truly unusual to
be able to use the Buso

276
00:14:50,838 --> 00:14:53,304
Renkin to this extent
in just one week.

277
00:14:56,904 --> 00:14:58,838
The fifth day is ending.

278
00:14:58,871 --> 00:15:00,838
There's one more day.

279
00:15:00,871 --> 00:15:04,604
Time will run out tomorrow
night at midnight.

280
00:15:04,638 --> 00:15:06,371
-Tokiko, how are you doing?

281
00:15:06,404 --> 00:15:08,638
We should climb down the
mountain before sunrise.

282
00:15:08,671 --> 00:15:10,971
-Not with your body
in that condition.

283
00:15:11,004 --> 00:15:13,638
It'll just be better to
spend the night here.

284
00:15:13,671 --> 00:15:16,271
It seems that we're quite
deep in the mountains.

285
00:15:16,304 --> 00:15:17,804
We'll rest for the
night and recover

286
00:15:17,838 --> 00:15:20,404
with the healing
power of the Kakugane.

287
00:15:20,438 --> 00:15:22,738
Even if we go down the mountain
tomorrow morning and get

288
00:15:22,771 --> 00:15:26,204
on the train, we probably
wouldn't arrive in Gensei City

289
00:15:26,238 --> 00:15:28,504
until nightfall.

290
00:15:28,538 --> 00:15:31,604
-Then we'll start looking for
Chouno as soon as we arrive.

291
00:15:31,638 --> 00:15:34,004
-I've got a pretty good
idea of his whereabouts.

292
00:15:34,038 --> 00:15:37,338
Now that he's lost his
home and all his Homunculi,

293
00:15:37,371 --> 00:15:40,138
he's nothing but a helpless
high school student.

294
00:15:40,171 --> 00:15:43,804
His last hope is most
likely his family home.

295
00:15:43,838 --> 00:15:44,904
-All right.

296
00:15:44,938 --> 00:15:46,571
Time doesn't run out
until midnight tomorrow.

297
00:15:46,604 --> 00:15:48,004
We have plenty of time!

298
00:15:48,038 --> 00:15:49,238
-Yes, that's right.

299
00:15:49,271 --> 00:15:52,238
I'll stay behind here and
leave all the rest to you.

300
00:15:52,271 --> 00:15:54,204
That's the best thing to do.

301
00:15:54,238 --> 00:15:55,371
-What are you talking about?

302
00:15:55,404 --> 00:15:56,304
That doesn't make sense.

303
00:15:56,338 --> 00:15:57,004
-Don't shake me,
I'm in bad shape.

304
00:15:57,038 --> 00:15:57,771
We're both in bad shape.

305
00:15:57,804 --> 00:15:58,571
Stop it!

306
00:15:58,604 --> 00:15:59,871
-Don't say stuff like that!

307
00:15:59,904 --> 00:16:00,371
-Oh!

308
00:16:03,371 --> 00:16:06,671
-The only way you can make
it in time is by yourself.

309
00:16:06,704 --> 00:16:10,871
Thanks to this, my lower body's
paralyzed and I can't move.

310
00:16:10,904 --> 00:16:13,304
That's why I can't go down
the mountain, you understand?

311
00:16:13,338 --> 00:16:15,304
KAZUKI: But then I won't
have time to come back,

312
00:16:15,338 --> 00:16:17,538
even if I do get the antidote.

313
00:16:17,571 --> 00:16:18,871
-It's OK.

314
00:16:18,904 --> 00:16:21,271
You don't need to
come back anyway.

315
00:16:21,304 --> 00:16:25,704
Tomorrow morning, after you're
gone and I can no longer see,

316
00:16:25,738 --> 00:16:28,938
I'm going to take care of
things by finishing myself off.

317
00:16:28,971 --> 00:16:29,971
[shouting]

318
00:16:30,004 --> 00:16:31,138
-I told you not to
shake me like this.

319
00:16:31,171 --> 00:16:33,304
This way we're both
going to die, now stop i!

320
00:16:36,238 --> 00:16:37,471
-Wait a minute.

321
00:16:37,504 --> 00:16:40,004
This morning you said you
were on a mission, right?

322
00:16:40,038 --> 00:16:42,371
That means you've got friends
and people you can rely on.

323
00:16:42,404 --> 00:16:44,004
-It's useless.

324
00:16:44,038 --> 00:16:46,671
All the Warriors in Japan
are currently out there

325
00:16:46,704 --> 00:16:48,638
on missions of their own.

326
00:16:48,671 --> 00:16:51,904
Unfortunately, even if
I were to ask for help,

327
00:16:51,938 --> 00:16:55,538
it wouldn't show up by
tomorrow at midnight.

328
00:16:55,571 --> 00:16:57,871
I'm sure there'll eventually
be some kind of action

329
00:16:57,904 --> 00:16:59,138
by the main unit.

330
00:16:59,171 --> 00:17:03,271
But it'll only come after
the situation is resolved.

331
00:17:03,304 --> 00:17:05,771
Not too long after this
happens, another warrior

332
00:17:05,804 --> 00:17:08,438
should appear
before you, Kazuki.

333
00:17:08,471 --> 00:17:12,104
Once you report all the
details to that person,

334
00:17:12,138 --> 00:17:14,304
you should bury everything
that happened this week

335
00:17:14,338 --> 00:17:18,138
into the depths of your memory.

336
00:17:18,171 --> 00:17:19,838
You should spend
your days happily

337
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:23,404
with your sister, and
your friends as well.

338
00:17:23,438 --> 00:17:26,904
You should just go home, Kazuki.

339
00:17:26,938 --> 00:17:28,338
KAZUKI: OK.

340
00:17:28,371 --> 00:17:29,204
I'll go back.

341
00:17:29,238 --> 00:17:30,004
TOKIKO: Good.

342
00:17:30,038 --> 00:17:31,004
That's the way it should be.

343
00:17:31,038 --> 00:17:33,071
-But with you.

344
00:17:33,104 --> 00:17:34,304
-Hey!

345
00:17:34,338 --> 00:17:35,704
Just because I
can't move doesn't

346
00:17:35,738 --> 00:17:37,771
mean you can do whatever
you want with me.

347
00:17:37,804 --> 00:17:40,438
-If we go down the mountain
without waiting for daybreak,

348
00:17:40,471 --> 00:17:42,271
then I'm sure we can get
there before the night falls.

349
00:17:42,304 --> 00:17:43,938
-If you push yourself
like this, you're

350
00:17:43,971 --> 00:17:45,871
gonna drain your
stamina and collapse.

351
00:17:45,904 --> 00:17:46,771
-I'll be OK.

352
00:17:46,804 --> 00:17:48,238
You don't weigh that much.

353
00:17:48,271 --> 00:17:49,071
-You idiot.

354
00:17:49,104 --> 00:17:50,538
That's not the issue.

355
00:17:50,571 --> 00:17:51,471
Let me down.

356
00:17:51,504 --> 00:17:52,804
-Hell no.

357
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:55,504
I said before that I didn't
want any more victims, remember?

358
00:17:55,538 --> 00:17:58,604
Right now, you happen to
be one of the victims too.

359
00:17:58,638 --> 00:17:59,738
We can do it.

360
00:17:59,771 --> 00:18:01,304
I'll show you that I can
make it there in time.

361
00:18:04,104 --> 00:18:05,438
TOKIKO (VOICEOVER):
His shoulders

362
00:18:05,471 --> 00:18:07,104
are much broader than they look.

363
00:18:12,904 --> 00:18:14,738
NEWSCASTER: The origin
of the gusty winds

364
00:18:14,771 --> 00:18:18,538
that damaged Ginsei High
Dormitory in Saitama Prefecture

365
00:18:18,571 --> 00:18:19,938
in Ginsei City--

366
00:18:19,971 --> 00:18:20,771
-I'm worried.

367
00:18:20,804 --> 00:18:22,004
NEWSCASTER: --is still unknown.

368
00:18:22,038 --> 00:18:23,404
-Kazuki still isn't back.

369
00:18:23,438 --> 00:18:24,404
-I don't know.

370
00:18:24,438 --> 00:18:26,204
Has been disappearing
a lot lately.

371
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:28,438
But this time he's
been gone a full day.

372
00:18:28,471 --> 00:18:29,638
-Yeah, tell me about it.

373
00:18:29,671 --> 00:18:31,704
During attendance
yesterday, I actually

374
00:18:31,738 --> 00:18:33,504
managed to get away
mimicking his voice.

375
00:18:36,071 --> 00:18:37,071
(KAZUKI VOICE) Hi, guys.

376
00:18:37,104 --> 00:18:38,538
I'm Kazuki.

377
00:18:38,571 --> 00:18:39,804
-Did you actually just do that?

378
00:18:39,838 --> 00:18:41,504
-What kinda freak are you?

379
00:18:41,538 --> 00:18:42,704
-Anyway.

380
00:18:42,738 --> 00:18:44,604
Ever since that Tokiko
showed up in the picture,

381
00:18:44,638 --> 00:18:47,004
Kazuki's weirdness has
kicked into high gear.

382
00:18:47,038 --> 00:18:49,104
Could it be that he's
gotten involved in something

383
00:18:49,138 --> 00:18:49,971
dangerous?

384
00:18:50,004 --> 00:18:51,771
-Well, if that's
the case, then--

385
00:18:51,804 --> 00:18:52,871
MAHIRO (VOICEOVER): Kazuki.

386
00:18:55,971 --> 00:18:57,338
-Big brother!

387
00:18:57,371 --> 00:18:59,438
-Kazuki.

388
00:18:59,471 --> 00:18:59,938
-I'm home.

389
00:19:03,038 --> 00:19:05,371
-Madly in love
and all beaten up?

390
00:19:05,404 --> 00:19:08,171
-What on Earth happened to you?

391
00:19:08,204 --> 00:19:10,938
Were you actually blown away
by yesterday's gusty winds?

392
00:19:10,971 --> 00:19:11,871
-Oh yeah.

393
00:19:11,904 --> 00:19:13,238
That's right.

394
00:19:13,271 --> 00:19:15,238
And Tokiko became unable to move
because of her chronic lower

395
00:19:15,271 --> 00:19:18,304
back pain, so I carried her
on my back the whole way here.

396
00:19:18,338 --> 00:19:19,638
-All the way?

397
00:19:19,671 --> 00:19:20,171
-Yep.

398
00:19:20,204 --> 00:19:22,971
All the way.

399
00:19:23,004 --> 00:19:23,771
-Enough.

400
00:19:23,804 --> 00:19:24,638
Enough already.

401
00:19:24,671 --> 00:19:26,004
Just let me die.

402
00:19:26,038 --> 00:19:27,271
-No negative thoughts!

403
00:19:27,304 --> 00:19:28,838
It's still too soon to give up.

404
00:19:28,871 --> 00:19:30,238
-He is right, Tokiko.

405
00:19:30,271 --> 00:19:33,371
Lower back pain can
be cured, you know.

406
00:19:33,404 --> 00:19:35,571
TOKIKO (VOICEOVER): She
is Kazuki's little sister

407
00:19:35,604 --> 00:19:36,338
after all.

408
00:19:36,371 --> 00:19:38,204
-Mhmm.

409
00:19:38,238 --> 00:19:39,071
-All right, everyone.

410
00:19:39,104 --> 00:19:41,304
I need to get going.

411
00:19:41,338 --> 00:19:42,071
-Kazuki, wait!

412
00:19:42,104 --> 00:19:44,571
Where are you off to now?

413
00:19:44,604 --> 00:19:45,604
-Don't worry.

414
00:19:45,638 --> 00:19:47,071
I've just got some
unfinished business.

415
00:19:47,104 --> 00:19:48,738
-But you're all beaten up.

416
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:51,171
Why don't you just rest
and wait 'til tomorrow?

417
00:19:51,204 --> 00:19:51,938
KAZUKI: No.

418
00:19:51,971 --> 00:19:53,104
It has to be done tonight.

419
00:19:55,738 --> 00:19:56,838
Listen, Mahiro.

420
00:19:56,871 --> 00:19:58,538
I need you to do
something for me.

421
00:19:58,571 --> 00:20:00,604
Take care of Tokiko
while I'm gone.

422
00:20:00,638 --> 00:20:01,338
-What?

423
00:20:01,371 --> 00:20:02,138
-OK?

424
00:20:02,171 --> 00:20:03,704
I'll be back soon, I promise.

425
00:20:03,738 --> 00:20:04,238
-Got it.

426
00:20:04,271 --> 00:20:05,171
Leave it me.

427
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,138
As a matter of
fact, I'm a master

428
00:20:07,171 --> 00:20:08,304
of taking care of people.

429
00:20:08,338 --> 00:20:10,238
TOKIKO (VOICEOVER):
She's pure Kazuki.

430
00:20:10,271 --> 00:20:12,438
A complete female
version of him.

431
00:20:12,471 --> 00:20:13,804
-Wait a second, Kazuki.

432
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:14,971
What's going on?

433
00:20:15,004 --> 00:20:15,904
Tell us.

434
00:20:15,938 --> 00:20:17,304
Are you hiding
something from us?

435
00:20:17,338 --> 00:20:18,204
What's the deal?

436
00:20:18,238 --> 00:20:18,971
Have you gotten
yourself involved

437
00:20:19,004 --> 00:20:19,938
in something dangerous?

438
00:20:23,238 --> 00:20:24,571
-Sorry.

439
00:20:24,604 --> 00:20:25,904
Okakura.

440
00:20:25,938 --> 00:20:29,904
As you said, I'm involved in
a messy situation right now.

441
00:20:29,938 --> 00:20:32,171
But it's all going to
be resolved tonight.

442
00:20:32,204 --> 00:20:33,304
Everything's gonna be fine.

443
00:20:38,004 --> 00:20:39,938
-Even if you can't tell
us about the situation,

444
00:20:39,971 --> 00:20:41,704
if you need my help, I'm ready.

445
00:20:41,738 --> 00:20:42,804
You know that.

446
00:20:42,838 --> 00:20:45,871
But no worries and no
pressure, all right?

447
00:20:45,904 --> 00:20:47,604
Go and do what you need to do.

448
00:20:47,638 --> 00:20:49,004
-Kazuki, wait.

449
00:20:49,038 --> 00:20:51,238
-What is it, Tokiko?

450
00:20:51,271 --> 00:20:53,204
-Your cell phone is
no longer any use

451
00:20:53,238 --> 00:20:55,538
to you because of the
battle last night,

452
00:20:55,571 --> 00:20:57,471
so take this with you.

453
00:20:57,504 --> 00:21:00,904
Remember to give me a detailed
report on the situation.

454
00:21:00,938 --> 00:21:04,204
And I want you to take this too.

455
00:21:04,238 --> 00:21:06,738
I can't say it will give
you twice the strength,

456
00:21:06,771 --> 00:21:10,238
but two will have stronger
healing powers than one.

457
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:12,071
You can reduce the
burden on your body

458
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:15,104
if you apply one to the Buso
Renkin and the other one

459
00:21:15,138 --> 00:21:15,604
to healing.

460
00:21:18,504 --> 00:21:19,771
Kazuki.

461
00:21:19,804 --> 00:21:22,438
You are far better suited
being with your little sister

462
00:21:22,471 --> 00:21:25,171
and your friends than
fighting these battles,

463
00:21:25,204 --> 00:21:27,738
so I want to be completely
sure that you're not

464
00:21:27,771 --> 00:21:30,271
doing this for me.

465
00:21:30,304 --> 00:21:32,071
So come back here
for your own sake,

466
00:21:32,104 --> 00:21:34,104
no matter what
happens out there.

467
00:21:34,138 --> 00:21:35,004
-Understood.

468
00:21:35,038 --> 00:21:36,338
Definitely.

469
00:21:36,371 --> 00:21:38,871
No matter what, I will be back.

470
00:21:42,271 --> 00:21:44,171
KAZUKI (VOICEOVER):
I'll be back, Tokiko.

471
00:21:44,204 --> 00:21:45,138
Everyone.

472
00:21:45,171 --> 00:21:45,871
Just wait for me.

473
00:21:53,723 --> 00:21:56,657
[theme music]

474
00:23:25,405 --> 00:23:27,987
TOKIKO: Kazuki, It's
useless talking to the guy.

475
00:23:28,021 --> 00:23:29,949
He just won't listen
to reason anymore.

476
00:23:29,982 --> 00:23:33,949
all you need to do is take the
Homunculus embryo from him.

477
00:23:33,982 --> 00:23:36,915
Next time, the Butterfly
of a Black Death.

478
00:23:36,949 --> 00:23:39,049
I'll splatter your guts.

479
00:23:43,282 --> 00:23:45,115
-Mahiro's Buso Renkin seminar.

480
00:23:49,182 --> 00:23:51,782
Hey everyone, this
is Mahiro here,

481
00:23:51,815 --> 00:23:55,749
with another round of awesome
commentary on the Buso Renkin.

482
00:23:55,782 --> 00:23:59,282
Since this is our second round
of the Buso Renkin seminar,

483
00:23:59,315 --> 00:24:04,182
my commentary this time
goes to Valkyrie Skirt!

484
00:24:04,215 --> 00:24:05,282
Oh.

485
00:24:05,315 --> 00:24:07,515
Before we get into that,
I think you already

486
00:24:07,549 --> 00:24:11,549
know who wields the
Valkyrie Skirt, right?

487
00:24:11,582 --> 00:24:13,449
Her name, Tokiko Tsumura.

488
00:24:13,482 --> 00:24:14,015
Yep!

489
00:24:14,049 --> 00:24:15,382
That's right!

490
00:24:15,415 --> 00:24:16,349
Tokiko!

491
00:24:16,382 --> 00:24:17,882
She's the person
who gave me brother

492
00:24:17,915 --> 00:24:21,115
a new life after he was
killed by a homunculus.

493
00:24:21,149 --> 00:24:24,082
She's very slender, and
much smaller than I am,

494
00:24:24,115 --> 00:24:27,382
and yet she is a strong
alchemist warrior

495
00:24:27,415 --> 00:24:30,249
who fights and defeat Homunculi.

496
00:24:30,282 --> 00:24:32,682
Ever so cool, she's good
at giving harsh retorts

497
00:24:32,715 --> 00:24:34,649
in response to my
brother's silly comments.

498
00:24:34,682 --> 00:24:38,882
It's a husband and wife
comedy stand up duo.

499
00:24:38,915 --> 00:24:43,249
I'm so jealous of Kazuki because
he gets all the attention.

500
00:24:43,282 --> 00:24:44,149
Oh, but wait!

501
00:24:44,182 --> 00:24:45,515
If the two are
married, then that

502
00:24:45,549 --> 00:24:47,549
makes Tokiko my big sister!

503
00:24:47,582 --> 00:24:51,082
And that means we can do things
like this, and that, and oh!

504
00:24:51,115 --> 00:24:52,515
Oh, what am I gonna do?

505
00:24:52,549 --> 00:24:55,449
I'm so excited!

506
00:24:55,482 --> 00:24:56,415
Oh.

507
00:24:56,449 --> 00:24:57,882
Oops.

508
00:24:57,915 --> 00:24:59,615
I'm so sorry.

509
00:24:59,649 --> 00:25:01,649
My imagination got carried away.

510
00:25:01,682 --> 00:25:04,482
I'll continue that when
I get back to the dorms.

511
00:25:04,515 --> 00:25:06,382
All right!

512
00:25:06,415 --> 00:25:08,082
Back to where we left off.

513
00:25:08,115 --> 00:25:09,615
Tokiko wields and
controls the death

514
00:25:09,649 --> 00:25:12,882
scythe Buso Renkin
Valkyrie Skirt.

515
00:25:12,915 --> 00:25:15,282
Notice the parts
attached to her thighs.

516
00:25:15,315 --> 00:25:17,982
There are four long
thingies sticking out.

517
00:25:18,015 --> 00:25:19,749
The tip of it is
made into a scythe

518
00:25:19,782 --> 00:25:22,349
that can cut almost anything.

519
00:25:22,382 --> 00:25:26,115
Using its manipulators for
quick and precise movements,

520
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:29,915
Tokiko can take out an
army of enemies at once.

521
00:25:29,949 --> 00:25:31,749
Plus, the manipulators
are directly

522
00:25:31,782 --> 00:25:34,682
controlled by bioelectricity
signals flowing

523
00:25:34,715 --> 00:25:36,682
through her nervous system.

524
00:25:36,715 --> 00:25:39,815
That's why, in order to
relay messages more precisely

525
00:25:39,849 --> 00:25:42,882
and more quickly, Tokiko
attaches them directly

526
00:25:42,915 --> 00:25:44,915
onto her skin.

527
00:25:44,949 --> 00:25:46,415
Even though she
seemed cold to use

528
00:25:46,449 --> 00:25:48,882
and acted really weird
when we first met,

529
00:25:48,915 --> 00:25:51,949
Tokiko is now part of our group.

530
00:25:51,982 --> 00:25:55,349
She's the cool big sister whose
quick wits can put everyone

531
00:25:55,382 --> 00:25:57,049
in their place.

532
00:25:57,082 --> 00:26:00,182
Please take care of my
big brother, Tokiko!

533
00:26:00,215 --> 00:26:01,382
Okie Dokie!

534
00:26:01,415 --> 00:26:03,549
Until next time!
