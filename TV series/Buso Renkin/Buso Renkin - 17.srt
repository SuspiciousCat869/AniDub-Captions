NARRATOR: The supernatural
alloy produced

2
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:18,933
by gathering the essence
of alchemy is the Kakugane.

3
00:00:18,966 --> 00:00:22,866
This device activates upon a
person's fighting instinct,

4
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,466
manifesting the
possessor's inner power

5
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,133
into a tangible form, creating
a weapon like no other.

6
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:32,000
Its name, Buso Renkin.

MAN: Yes.

9
00:02:11,623 --> 00:02:12,656
Yes, I understand.

10
00:02:12,689 --> 00:02:15,823
We'll start the
preparations immediately.

11
00:02:15,856 --> 00:02:17,123
We have an urgent mission.

12
00:02:17,156 --> 00:02:18,256
-What is it?

13
00:02:18,289 --> 00:02:19,756
Does it have anything
to do with the young man

14
00:02:19,789 --> 00:02:20,756
we examined before?

15
00:02:20,789 --> 00:02:22,123
-Yes.

16
00:02:22,156 --> 00:02:24,123
While it hasn't been confirmed,
it seems he was disposed of.

17
00:02:24,156 --> 00:02:24,856
-Really?

18
00:02:24,889 --> 00:02:25,923
What a pity.

19
00:02:25,956 --> 00:02:27,256
He was so young.

20
00:02:27,289 --> 00:02:30,156
-We need to recover the black
Kakugane embedded in his chest.

TOKIKO (VOICEOVER):
Kazuki's been--

22
00:02:31,623 --> 00:02:34,356
-The site is Iruka Beach
of Chiba Prefecture.

23
00:02:34,389 --> 00:02:35,723
He will most likely
be discovered

24
00:02:35,756 --> 00:02:37,389
as a drowning victim.

25
00:02:37,423 --> 00:02:39,656
We need to make arrangements
with the local hospital

26
00:02:39,689 --> 00:02:41,089
to recover that black Kakugane.

27
00:02:54,789 --> 00:02:56,456
-Let go of me!

28
00:02:56,489 --> 00:02:58,556
-There's no way
that Captain Bravo

29
00:02:58,589 --> 00:03:01,723
would leave a mission half done.

30
00:03:01,756 --> 00:03:03,656
[groaning]

31
00:03:11,456 --> 00:03:13,389
-This is the energy drain.

32
00:03:13,423 --> 00:03:15,356
-He can't be, even
if he unconscious

33
00:03:15,389 --> 00:03:16,623
and stopped breathing.

34
00:03:16,656 --> 00:03:18,489
But with a black
Kakugane, he can't

35
00:03:18,523 --> 00:03:20,156
be destroyed, even
though he's dead.

36
00:03:20,189 --> 00:03:25,056
-In that case, Kazuki
must still be--

37
00:03:25,089 --> 00:03:25,556
-Tokiko!

38
00:03:32,789 --> 00:03:33,523
TOKIKO: Kazuki.

39
00:03:33,556 --> 00:03:34,723
Kazuki!

40
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:36,456
Wake up, Kazuki.

41
00:03:36,489 --> 00:03:39,123
Wake up, Kazuki!

42
00:03:39,156 --> 00:03:40,823
Tokiko, that's enough!

43
00:03:40,856 --> 00:03:42,189
The mission must not fail.

44
00:03:42,223 --> 00:03:43,589
He's a certified monster!

45
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:46,689
If he isn't exterminated, then
irreparable harm may be done.

46
00:03:46,723 --> 00:03:47,156
Buso--

47
00:03:47,189 --> 00:03:48,056
-No.

48
00:03:48,089 --> 00:03:49,289
Don't.

49
00:03:49,323 --> 00:03:52,356
I am the one responsible
for making Kazuki like this.

50
00:03:52,389 --> 00:03:54,323
You want to call
Kazuki a monster,

51
00:03:54,356 --> 00:03:55,689
then you should
call me one, too.

52
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:04,189
-Damn!

53
00:04:04,223 --> 00:04:06,123
-Gota?

54
00:04:06,156 --> 00:04:07,256
-Drain me, not Tokiko.

55
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:07,923
Do you hear me?

56
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:08,756
Drain me!

57
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:17,723
-It's just as the
Alchemist Army predicted.

58
00:04:17,756 --> 00:04:21,423
The energy drain has absolutely
no effect upon the Silver Skin.

59
00:04:21,456 --> 00:04:24,323
And, in reverse mode, it
is capable of containing

60
00:04:24,356 --> 00:04:25,923
the power, as well.

61
00:04:25,956 --> 00:04:27,056
-Really?

62
00:04:27,089 --> 00:04:29,123
That's most unfortunate.

63
00:04:29,156 --> 00:04:31,889
So then this means that in our
decisive battle against Victor,

64
00:04:31,923 --> 00:04:33,589
you get to be the
ace in the hole.

65
00:04:36,789 --> 00:04:38,256
I'm a bit jealous.

66
00:04:38,289 --> 00:04:39,889
-You shouldn't jump
to conclusions.

67
00:04:39,923 --> 00:04:42,356
This was only a test against
a hypothetical enemy.

68
00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:45,656
It won't necessarily have the
same effect against Victor.

69
00:04:45,689 --> 00:04:47,156
-And that hypothetical enemy.

70
00:04:47,189 --> 00:04:48,889
Was it Kazuki Muto?

71
00:04:48,923 --> 00:04:51,323
Why did you leave his
body in the ocean?

72
00:04:51,356 --> 00:04:55,156
Don't tell me that you did
that to let him get away.

73
00:04:55,189 --> 00:04:57,189
-Don't underestimate
me, Hiwatari.

74
00:04:57,223 --> 00:04:59,523
I felt his death
with this very first.

75
00:04:59,556 --> 00:05:02,923
There's no doubt that
I killed Kazuki Muto.

76
00:05:02,956 --> 00:05:06,723
-I shall lead the unit
to recover the Kakugane.

77
00:05:06,756 --> 00:05:09,489
You shouldn't make any
unnecessary moves, Sakimori.

78
00:05:12,089 --> 00:05:14,956
-Don't you call me by that name.

79
00:05:14,989 --> 00:05:16,956
-Haven't you received
orders to return to base?

80
00:05:16,989 --> 00:05:18,756
Then you should return
to army headquarters

81
00:05:18,789 --> 00:05:19,623
and await the report.

82
00:05:28,956 --> 00:05:31,189
PAPILLON: How did
you find this place?

83
00:05:31,223 --> 00:05:33,123
-I was in charge of
the computer network

84
00:05:33,156 --> 00:05:35,623
at Dr. Butterfly's
secret LXE base,

85
00:05:35,656 --> 00:05:38,356
so I was able to find this
place when I hacked it.

86
00:05:38,389 --> 00:05:39,756
-Hm.

87
00:05:39,789 --> 00:05:42,423
If I remember correctly,
didn't the Alchemist Army

88
00:05:42,456 --> 00:05:44,856
take you into their protection?

89
00:05:44,889 --> 00:05:46,323
Have you come to
defeat me in order

90
00:05:46,356 --> 00:05:48,156
to earn some points with them?

91
00:05:48,189 --> 00:05:51,089
-My Kakugane's been
confiscated, so I'm powerless.

92
00:05:51,123 --> 00:05:55,356
I have come here for
Kazuki Muto's sake.

93
00:05:55,389 --> 00:06:00,323
Papillon, I've come to ask you
to save Kazuki Muto's life.

94
00:06:00,356 --> 00:06:01,456
-Hm.

95
00:06:01,489 --> 00:06:03,323
Oh, really?

96
00:06:03,356 --> 00:06:05,189
Well then, let's hear
what you have to say.

97
00:06:13,423 --> 00:06:15,389
-Oh, no.

98
00:06:15,423 --> 00:06:16,556
I must have passed out.

99
00:06:16,589 --> 00:06:17,223
For how long?

100
00:06:20,089 --> 00:06:20,623
Kazuki?

101
00:06:23,556 --> 00:06:24,289
Kazuki--

102
00:06:24,323 --> 00:06:25,489
-I'm sorry.

103
00:06:25,523 --> 00:06:28,223
Dying and coming back to
life, coming back to life

104
00:06:28,256 --> 00:06:29,623
only to die again.

105
00:06:29,656 --> 00:06:35,889
I'm always causing you trouble,
but there won't be a next time.

106
00:06:35,923 --> 00:06:36,389
-Kazuki.

107
00:06:39,889 --> 00:06:42,156
-I've hacked into
the army's computers.

108
00:06:42,189 --> 00:06:45,523
Kazuki Muto's condition
is now at stage one.

109
00:06:45,556 --> 00:06:48,656
In roughly six weeks he
will reach stage two.

110
00:06:48,689 --> 00:06:50,823
At that time, he is
expected to transform

111
00:06:50,856 --> 00:06:53,056
into being identical
to the first Victor.

112
00:06:53,089 --> 00:06:56,523
Kazuki Muto is now being
referred to as Victor Three.

113
00:06:56,556 --> 00:06:59,189
He is to be eliminated
swiftly and quietly in order

114
00:06:59,223 --> 00:07:01,056
to recover the black Kakugane.

115
00:07:01,089 --> 00:07:02,123
-Oh, dear.

116
00:07:02,156 --> 00:07:03,923
He really is in a
tough spot, isn't he?

117
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:06,089
-Are you really as
indifferent as you seem?

118
00:07:06,123 --> 00:07:07,756
If we let matters
continue this way,

119
00:07:07,789 --> 00:07:09,856
then Kazuki will
surely be killed.

120
00:07:09,889 --> 00:07:11,489
Surprising.

121
00:07:11,523 --> 00:07:12,956
I was under the
impression that you

122
00:07:12,989 --> 00:07:14,889
wanted to kill Kazuki yourself.

123
00:07:14,923 --> 00:07:16,923
-What are you getting at?

124
00:07:16,956 --> 00:07:19,123
-I want you to help Kazuki.

125
00:07:19,156 --> 00:07:20,056
-Ah.

126
00:07:20,089 --> 00:07:22,256
-I'm serious about this.

127
00:07:22,289 --> 00:07:24,489
You yourself are scheming
to become a Victor,

128
00:07:24,523 --> 00:07:25,856
isn't that right?

129
00:07:25,889 --> 00:07:29,356
Wouldn't it be good for you to
have a sample close at hand?

130
00:07:29,389 --> 00:07:30,323
-Hm.

131
00:07:30,356 --> 00:07:31,789
But of course.

132
00:07:31,823 --> 00:07:33,856
-Saving Kazuki from
the Alchemist Army

133
00:07:33,889 --> 00:07:36,556
is not a bad proposition from
your point of view, either.

134
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:37,689
-Ah-ha!

135
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:39,456
But no.

136
00:07:39,489 --> 00:07:41,423
I love using other
people for my benefit,

137
00:07:41,456 --> 00:07:43,089
but unfortunately
for you, there's

138
00:07:43,123 --> 00:07:46,889
nothing I hate more than
being used by others.

139
00:07:46,923 --> 00:07:48,589
And I don't
appreciate the way you

140
00:07:48,623 --> 00:07:51,156
are trying to manipulate
me, while you yourself

141
00:07:51,189 --> 00:07:52,789
do nothing about the situation.

142
00:07:52,823 --> 00:07:55,023
-If I could do
something, I would.

143
00:07:55,056 --> 00:07:56,456
But I'm still
recovering, and I'm

144
00:07:56,489 --> 00:07:58,123
powerless without a Kakugane.

145
00:07:58,156 --> 00:08:02,556
There's absolutely nothing
I can do to help him.

146
00:08:02,589 --> 00:08:05,489
-A genuine Kakugane,
serial number 70.

147
00:08:05,523 --> 00:08:07,056
The one that Dr.
Butterfly was using

148
00:08:07,089 --> 00:08:08,623
before his untimely passing.

149
00:08:08,656 --> 00:08:10,689
You say you have no power?

150
00:08:10,723 --> 00:08:12,923
What about the ability
to elicit information

151
00:08:12,956 --> 00:08:14,289
from the Alchemist Army?

152
00:08:14,323 --> 00:08:16,589
Or your devious
plans on using me?

153
00:08:16,623 --> 00:08:19,589
Infiltrate the army
and gather information.

154
00:08:19,623 --> 00:08:21,823
I will be the one who uses you.

155
00:08:21,856 --> 00:08:23,556
-Well, it looks like
I will be the one who

156
00:08:23,589 --> 00:08:25,456
gets used, after all.

157
00:08:25,489 --> 00:08:28,123
Buso Renkin.

158
00:08:28,156 --> 00:08:31,723
-Angel Gozen is back again
as an alternate type!

159
00:08:31,756 --> 00:08:34,656
But I'm not so sure
I like this new look!

160
00:08:34,689 --> 00:08:35,856
-Oh, my.

161
00:08:35,889 --> 00:08:38,423
-Stylish, don't you think?

162
00:08:38,456 --> 00:08:39,956
So, then you say
he's at Iruka Beach?

163
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:44,389
KAZUKI: FOr the
next six weeks, I

164
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:48,856
intend to keep fighting on as
a human being, to the very end.

165
00:08:48,889 --> 00:08:50,256
-I see.

166
00:08:50,289 --> 00:08:52,789
But what exactly do the words
fighting to the very end mean?

167
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:54,789
-I'm not sure, but
you're not exactly

168
00:08:54,823 --> 00:08:56,889
offering me any other advice.

169
00:08:56,923 --> 00:08:59,656
-The black Kakugane
embedded in your chest--

170
00:08:59,689 --> 00:09:02,456
I recovered it from a previous
mission before we met.

171
00:09:02,489 --> 00:09:03,289
-That's right.

172
00:09:03,323 --> 00:09:04,723
I remember you telling me that.

173
00:09:04,756 --> 00:09:06,789
You came to this place
right after completing

174
00:09:06,823 --> 00:09:10,423
a previous mission
at another school.

175
00:09:10,456 --> 00:09:12,989
-If we return to that
school and investigate,

176
00:09:13,023 --> 00:09:14,589
we might figure out
a way of dealing

177
00:09:14,623 --> 00:09:15,589
with the black Kakugane.

178
00:09:17,956 --> 00:09:19,423
-Then I'm going to go there.

179
00:09:19,456 --> 00:09:21,589
-I can't let you
go alone, Kazuki.

180
00:09:21,623 --> 00:09:22,456
I'm going with you.

181
00:09:22,489 --> 00:09:23,656
-You can't.

182
00:09:23,689 --> 00:09:26,323
If you go with me, then
you'll be branded a traitor.

183
00:09:26,356 --> 00:09:27,189
-I don't care.

184
00:09:27,223 --> 00:09:28,589
I'm not leaving your side.

185
00:09:28,623 --> 00:09:29,089
-Tokiko.

186
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:33,889
TOKIKO: I know what
you're thinking, Kazuki.

187
00:09:33,923 --> 00:09:37,289
If six weeks passed and
everything were to go in vain,

188
00:09:37,323 --> 00:09:40,523
you would probably kill
yourself, wouldn't you?

189
00:09:40,556 --> 00:09:42,223
Well, I can't let that happen.

190
00:09:42,256 --> 00:09:43,723
For the next six
weeks, you and I

191
00:09:43,756 --> 00:09:46,823
shall be of one mind and body.

192
00:09:46,856 --> 00:09:53,156
If you're going to die, then
I'm going to die with you.

193
00:09:53,189 --> 00:09:54,856
You understand?

194
00:09:54,889 --> 00:09:56,456
-I'm not going to die.

195
00:09:56,489 --> 00:09:58,089
And I won't let you
die either, Tokiko.

196
00:10:00,756 --> 00:10:01,556
-Kazuki.

197
00:10:01,589 --> 00:10:03,056
What's wrong with your hand?

198
00:10:03,089 --> 00:10:06,289
Let me take care of it.

199
00:10:06,323 --> 00:10:08,023
-Thanks, Tokiko.

200
00:10:08,056 --> 00:10:09,123
-Oh, that's right.

201
00:10:09,156 --> 00:10:09,823
Gota.

202
00:10:09,856 --> 00:10:10,489
Gota!

203
00:10:10,523 --> 00:10:10,989
Gota?

204
00:10:35,123 --> 00:10:38,589
[laughing]

205
00:10:38,623 --> 00:10:40,189
TOKIKO: What are
you laughing about?

206
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:42,556
On your feet, Gota.

207
00:10:42,589 --> 00:10:44,923
If you can't pass the
survival training,

208
00:10:44,956 --> 00:10:47,456
then you'll never
make it as a Warrior.

209
00:10:47,489 --> 00:10:48,389
-I've had it, Tokiko.

210
00:10:48,423 --> 00:10:50,923
I'm too tired to go on.

211
00:10:50,956 --> 00:10:52,389
-Get up.

212
00:10:52,423 --> 00:10:56,956
If you don't, then I won't be
able to tend to your wounds.

213
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:59,623
So, why were you
taken in by the Army?

214
00:10:59,656 --> 00:11:01,056
-I've been told
that my family was

215
00:11:01,089 --> 00:11:02,789
slaughtered by the Homunculi.

216
00:11:02,823 --> 00:11:04,189
-What do you mean?

217
00:11:04,223 --> 00:11:05,723
-I don't remember a thing.

218
00:11:05,756 --> 00:11:08,223
I was just a baby
at the time, so I

219
00:11:08,256 --> 00:11:10,956
don't have any memories
about my family

220
00:11:10,989 --> 00:11:12,723
or the Homunculi
that killed them.

221
00:11:12,756 --> 00:11:15,556
As far back as I can remember,
I've been in an orphanage run

222
00:11:15,589 --> 00:11:18,089
by the Alchemist Army,
and apparently someone

223
00:11:18,123 --> 00:11:20,189
thought I possessed the
qualities to be a Warrior,

224
00:11:20,223 --> 00:11:21,156
so here I am.

225
00:11:24,056 --> 00:11:27,289
But after all, I guess I don't.

226
00:11:27,323 --> 00:11:29,456
-Is that so?

227
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:33,823
But what if one day you
actually find something you feel

228
00:11:33,856 --> 00:11:36,923
is worth fighting for?

229
00:11:36,956 --> 00:11:40,656
Someday, there may be
something you want to protect.

230
00:11:40,689 --> 00:11:43,689
Now's your chance to get
stronger and be ready,

231
00:11:43,723 --> 00:11:46,389
so when that day arrives
you'll not be powerless,

232
00:11:46,423 --> 00:11:51,523
nor will you be sorry
that you toughed it out.

233
00:11:51,556 --> 00:11:52,423
Now get up, Gota.

234
00:11:58,523 --> 00:12:02,356
-I can't do it, Tokiko.

235
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:03,989
-On your feet.

236
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:05,489
-Huh?

237
00:12:05,523 --> 00:12:07,156
Warrior Chief Hiwatari?

238
00:12:07,189 --> 00:12:10,523
-Your mission was to detain the
female Alchemist Warrior Tokiko

239
00:12:10,556 --> 00:12:13,556
Tsumura, but I don't
see her with you.

240
00:12:13,589 --> 00:12:15,823
Did you fail?

241
00:12:15,856 --> 00:12:18,723
Don't tell me-- she's with
Kazuki Muto right now,

242
00:12:18,756 --> 00:12:19,223
isn't she?

243
00:12:21,789 --> 00:12:24,323
So he's still alive, is he?

244
00:12:24,356 --> 00:12:26,023
Then lead me to him.

245
00:12:26,056 --> 00:12:29,923
I shall exterminate Kazuki Muto,
also known as Victor Three,

246
00:12:29,956 --> 00:12:32,923
and then the traitor
known as Tokiko, as well.

247
00:12:32,956 --> 00:12:34,289
-But wait a minute!

248
00:12:34,323 --> 00:12:36,489
We don't really know if she
really betrayed us or not.

249
00:12:40,223 --> 00:12:43,456
-You told her how dangerous
Victor Three is, didn't you?

250
00:12:43,489 --> 00:12:46,023
If she insists on protecting
him, then she's a traitor.

251
00:12:49,823 --> 00:12:52,156
It's about time
you guys showed up.

252
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:53,823
What took you morons so long?

253
00:12:56,423 --> 00:12:58,856
-Ikusabe, Negoro
reporting for duty.

254
00:12:58,889 --> 00:13:01,923
-Time to mobilize the
re-extermination squad.

255
00:13:01,956 --> 00:13:04,489
Our mission is to
destroy Victor Three,

256
00:13:04,523 --> 00:13:07,823
and there appears to be a
traitor with him as well.

257
00:13:07,856 --> 00:13:09,823
IKUSABE: But aren't
they just mere children?

258
00:13:09,856 --> 00:13:11,989
HIWATARI: We still need
to dispose of them.

259
00:13:12,023 --> 00:13:14,889
He may be incomplete,
but he is a Victor.

260
00:13:14,923 --> 00:13:17,456
-Someday there may be
something you want to protect.

261
00:13:17,489 --> 00:13:19,789
So when that day arrives
you'll not be powerless,

262
00:13:19,823 --> 00:13:22,689
nor will you be sorry
that you toughed it out.

263
00:13:22,723 --> 00:13:24,256
-Well, w you waiting for?

264
00:13:24,289 --> 00:13:26,989
Hurry up and take me to them.

265
00:13:27,023 --> 00:13:27,889
-No.

266
00:13:27,923 --> 00:13:28,823
-What?

267
00:13:28,856 --> 00:13:30,556
-I don't care what she did.

268
00:13:30,589 --> 00:13:33,056
I won't help you kill Tokiko.

269
00:13:33,089 --> 00:13:35,123
I won't do it!

270
00:13:35,156 --> 00:13:38,856
-What do you think you're doing?

271
00:13:41,352 --> 00:13:43,186
Have you lost your mind?

272
00:13:43,219 --> 00:13:45,319
It's three against one.

273
00:13:45,352 --> 00:13:46,952
You may be a rookie,
but surely you

274
00:13:46,986 --> 00:13:49,386
must realize how stupid this is.

275
00:13:49,419 --> 00:13:51,019
-If you're such
a combat veteran,

276
00:13:51,052 --> 00:13:55,052
then why are you just
talking, and not fighting me?

277
00:13:55,086 --> 00:13:55,986
-Heh.

278
00:13:56,019 --> 00:13:57,786
Pretty confident.

279
00:13:57,819 --> 00:13:58,352
-Buso Renkin!

280
00:14:01,586 --> 00:14:02,119
-Hm?

281
00:14:02,152 --> 00:14:02,686
-Empty handed?

282
00:14:09,852 --> 00:14:15,186
-Was that remote demolition,
or was it telekinesis?

283
00:14:15,219 --> 00:14:16,586
No, that's not it.

284
00:14:16,619 --> 00:14:18,686
It appears that you launched
some small, high speed

285
00:14:18,719 --> 00:14:21,119
weapon that circled around
beyond our field of vision

286
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:22,552
to strike from the sides.

287
00:14:27,486 --> 00:14:30,552
-Buso Renkin of
Chakram, Motor Gears!

288
00:14:30,586 --> 00:14:31,386
-What's a chakram?

289
00:14:31,419 --> 00:14:33,152
-It's an Indian thrown weapon.

290
00:14:33,186 --> 00:14:34,219
-Pretty clever.

291
00:14:34,252 --> 00:14:35,986
He destroyed our means
of transportation

292
00:14:36,019 --> 00:14:39,186
while simultaneously creating a
smokescreen with the explosion.

293
00:14:39,219 --> 00:14:43,119
-And all the commotion will
surely draw a curious crowd.

294
00:14:43,152 --> 00:14:47,852
-First a sneak attack, and now
you dare face me in a battle?

295
00:14:47,886 --> 00:14:50,252
Bring it on.

296
00:14:50,286 --> 00:14:52,586
GOTA (VOICEOVER): So that's
Warrior Chief Hiwatori's Buso

297
00:14:52,619 --> 00:14:53,086
Renkin.

298
00:14:59,086 --> 00:15:01,152
-He looks like he's
planning to escape,

299
00:15:01,186 --> 00:15:03,086
using the chakram as a decoy.

300
00:15:03,119 --> 00:15:05,486
-Warrior Chief, there's a
fire station three miles away.

301
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,486
They'll be here in
about 10 minutes.

302
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:09,419
-Heh, heh, heh.

303
00:15:15,019 --> 00:15:16,152
-As I expected.

304
00:15:16,186 --> 00:15:17,919
-But he won't get
away that easily.

305
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:25,019
-Motor Gears, Skywalker Mode!

306
00:15:25,052 --> 00:15:29,652
If I defeat him, I'll be
able to protect Tokiko!

307
00:15:29,686 --> 00:15:32,052
[shout]

308
00:15:36,419 --> 00:15:37,819
-Looks like I got him.

309
00:15:37,852 --> 00:15:39,252
-You think so, huh?

310
00:15:39,286 --> 00:15:41,786
Think again.

311
00:15:41,819 --> 00:15:44,186
[scream]

312
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:55,019
HIWATORI (VOICEOVER):
The ocean lies below?

313
00:15:55,052 --> 00:15:56,019
-Are you OK?

314
00:15:56,052 --> 00:15:57,586
-What happened to
that little punk?

315
00:15:57,619 --> 00:15:58,519
-He's fled.

316
00:16:01,786 --> 00:16:03,152
[sirens]

317
00:16:03,186 --> 00:16:04,719
-Warrior Chief--

318
00:16:04,752 --> 00:16:06,586
-Pull back, and leave no trace!

319
00:16:15,786 --> 00:16:18,019
GOTA (VOICEOVER): That attack
should have killed him.

320
00:16:18,052 --> 00:16:20,452
What on earth can
his Buso Renkin be?

321
00:16:20,486 --> 00:16:22,419
And what are its
characteristics?

322
00:16:22,452 --> 00:16:22,919
Tokiko!

[shout]

324
00:16:28,852 --> 00:16:29,786
-Stretch.

325
00:16:29,819 --> 00:16:31,219
Contract.

326
00:16:31,252 --> 00:16:32,186
Stretch.

327
00:16:32,219 --> 00:16:33,586
Contract.

328
00:16:33,619 --> 00:16:34,486
Stretch.

329
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:35,486
Stretch.

330
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:36,886
Stretch some more.

332
00:16:38,552 --> 00:16:42,119
-Believe it or not, I am a
master at hypnotic suggestion.

333
00:16:42,152 --> 00:16:43,486
All right, what's next?

334
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,652
-Twist.

335
00:16:44,686 --> 00:16:45,286
Twist.

336
00:16:45,319 --> 00:16:46,186
-Twist some more.

337
00:16:46,219 --> 00:16:46,686
Twist.

338
00:16:50,886 --> 00:16:51,486
Hey.

339
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:52,652
Good morning.

340
00:16:52,686 --> 00:16:55,186
-What are you guys doing
this early in the morning?

341
00:16:55,219 --> 00:16:57,086
BOY: Kazuki, that was
your idea, wasn't it?

342
00:16:57,119 --> 00:16:58,686
-It wasn't me, it
was all those--

343
00:16:58,719 --> 00:17:00,386
-Stop fooling
around and be quiet.

344
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:04,552
People are trying to sleep.

345
00:17:04,586 --> 00:17:05,786
Good, they're still sleeping.

346
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:09,219
There's my luggage.

347
00:17:09,252 --> 00:17:13,052
-We caught you, Tokiko!

348
00:17:13,086 --> 00:17:14,352
-Ha.

349
00:17:14,386 --> 00:17:16,152
-Where'd you slip out to?

350
00:17:16,186 --> 00:17:17,619
-Were you at strawberry's?

351
00:17:17,652 --> 00:17:18,586
-That's a no no!

352
00:17:18,619 --> 00:17:21,486
-You need to be punished.

353
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:22,919
-What are you doing?

354
00:17:22,952 --> 00:17:25,152
Be quiet, or you're gonna
wake up the other guests!

355
00:17:25,186 --> 00:17:25,652
-Shh!

356
00:17:28,052 --> 00:17:30,152
-By any chance, is
it another mission?

357
00:17:30,186 --> 00:17:31,319
-Well, something like that.

358
00:17:31,352 --> 00:17:33,286
-In that case, I guess
we shouldn't ask you

359
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:34,252
for the details.

360
00:17:34,286 --> 00:17:36,219
-We'd appreciate
it if you didn't.

361
00:17:36,252 --> 00:17:37,986
Just so you all
know, this time we

362
00:17:38,019 --> 00:17:39,919
might be gone for
up to six weeks.

363
00:17:39,952 --> 00:17:41,019
-Six weeks?

364
00:17:41,052 --> 00:17:42,852
So we won't see you
until the new semester?

365
00:17:42,886 --> 00:17:44,886
-You're giving up your vacation?

366
00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:46,819
Being a hero sure is tough.

367
00:17:46,852 --> 00:17:48,719
-Just make sure you take
good care of Tokiko.

368
00:17:48,752 --> 00:17:51,219
-Be careful and watch
out for yourselves.

369
00:17:51,252 --> 00:17:52,819
-Good luck to the both of you.

370
00:17:52,852 --> 00:17:53,686
-Here.

371
00:17:53,719 --> 00:17:55,119
Take this, an umbrella.

372
00:17:55,152 --> 00:17:57,686
There's only one, but
you guys can share it.

373
00:17:57,719 --> 00:18:00,052
-We'll see you
guys next semester!

374
00:18:00,086 --> 00:18:00,952
-Sure.

375
00:18:00,986 --> 00:18:04,186
-See you soon.

376
00:18:04,219 --> 00:18:06,286
-It looks like they're
both injured, doesn't it?

377
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:07,619
-Yes, it does.

378
00:18:07,652 --> 00:18:09,486
-I wonder if pretending
not to notice

379
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:11,019
was really the
right thing to do.

380
00:18:11,052 --> 00:18:12,319
-It's better that way.

381
00:18:12,352 --> 00:18:13,019
I'm telling you.

382
00:18:13,052 --> 00:18:14,252
-Are you all right?

383
00:18:14,286 --> 00:18:15,586
-Oh, don't worry about me.

384
00:18:15,619 --> 00:18:16,352
I'll be fine.

385
00:18:27,086 --> 00:18:30,086
-Let's go, Kazuki.

386
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:31,252
-Yeah.

387
00:18:31,286 --> 00:18:32,286
We'll go.

388
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,286
And we're coming back for sure.

389
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:34,952
I promise.

390
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:41,919
MAN: The fire spread to
the two cars and one house,

391
00:18:41,952 --> 00:18:43,419
but no human casualties.

392
00:18:43,452 --> 00:18:45,419
-We must make sure
that no civilians

393
00:18:45,452 --> 00:18:47,119
are harmed in our mission.

394
00:18:47,152 --> 00:18:49,619
-I wonder how long we
can keep things that way.

395
00:18:49,652 --> 00:18:51,552
-I'm not sure.

396
00:18:51,586 --> 00:18:52,886
-Follow that rookie.

397
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:55,619
I have no doubt he's going
to meet up with the traitors.

398
00:18:55,652 --> 00:18:58,352
-With proper training, he'd
probably make a fine Warrior.

399
00:18:58,386 --> 00:18:59,386
-No.

400
00:18:59,419 --> 00:19:01,019
We'll make sure he
gets properly killed.

401
00:19:01,052 --> 00:19:03,119
-Warrior Chief.

402
00:19:03,152 --> 00:19:05,552
-My way of doing things
is to use absurdity

403
00:19:05,586 --> 00:19:07,852
to force the absurd
into submission.

404
00:19:07,886 --> 00:19:09,386
Contact headquarters.

405
00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:11,252
Tell them that
Sakamori has failed,

406
00:19:11,286 --> 00:19:13,586
and that I shall proceed
with the mission.

407
00:19:17,686 --> 00:19:20,119
-This is where I fought
Bravo last night.

408
00:19:20,152 --> 00:19:24,152
I never imagined we'd
end up in this situation.

409
00:19:24,186 --> 00:19:26,586
You and Bravo were my
only fellow Warriors.

410
00:19:26,619 --> 00:19:30,386
I just wanted the three of us
to carry out the next mission

411
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,219
together.

412
00:19:32,252 --> 00:19:34,652
-Well now it's
just the two of us.

413
00:19:34,686 --> 00:19:37,552
-Yeah.

414
00:19:37,586 --> 00:19:42,286
I guess we'll just have to
get used to fighting as a duo.

415
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:44,119
-Gota!

416
00:19:44,152 --> 00:19:46,752
-Tokiko.

417
00:19:46,786 --> 00:19:49,952
-Re-extermination squad,
and Warrior Chief Hiwatari?

418
00:19:49,986 --> 00:19:52,052
-Gota, you should go
back to headquarters

419
00:19:52,086 --> 00:19:53,686
and turn yourself in.

420
00:19:53,719 --> 00:19:55,619
You'll still have to
face disciplinary action,

421
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:58,452
but at least you
won't be killed.

422
00:19:58,486 --> 00:19:59,119
-No.

423
00:19:59,152 --> 00:20:00,119
I'm coming with you.

424
00:20:00,152 --> 00:20:01,686
We're in this together.

425
00:20:01,719 --> 00:20:02,819
-Huh?

426
00:20:02,852 --> 00:20:04,619
GOTA (VOICEOVER): The
re-extermination squad

427
00:20:04,652 --> 00:20:08,186
also has Tokiko
on their hit list.

428
00:20:08,219 --> 00:20:10,619
I'm going with you.

429
00:20:10,652 --> 00:20:12,952
-Tokiko told me what you
did for me last night.

430
00:20:12,986 --> 00:20:13,786
Thanks, Gota.

431
00:20:18,019 --> 00:20:19,586
-Be careful!

432
00:20:19,619 --> 00:20:20,586
Let me see your hand.

433
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:22,886
I'll tend to your injuries.

434
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:23,819
-It's OK.

435
00:20:23,852 --> 00:20:25,352
I already took
care of it myself.

436
00:20:25,386 --> 00:20:27,152
-Just let me see.

437
00:20:27,186 --> 00:20:28,819
I overdid it last night.

438
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:29,819
I'm sorry.

439
00:20:33,786 --> 00:20:35,919
-Looks like we both
hurt the same hand.

440
00:20:35,952 --> 00:20:36,919
Anyway, what do you say?

441
00:20:41,152 --> 00:20:42,052
-Huh?

442
00:20:42,086 --> 00:20:43,919
Honestly.

443
00:20:43,952 --> 00:20:46,852
The two of you are acting
like a bunch of little kids.

444
00:20:46,886 --> 00:20:48,886
I'm going to withdraw
some money from the ATM

445
00:20:48,919 --> 00:20:50,552
before our accounts are frozen.

446
00:20:50,586 --> 00:20:53,386
Wait here.

447
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:56,419
-I just want to be clear that
I'm not doing this for you.

448
00:20:56,452 --> 00:20:58,619
The truth is, I don't
care what happens to you.

449
00:20:58,652 --> 00:21:01,186
I don't even care
what happens to me.

450
00:21:01,219 --> 00:21:05,086
All I want is to protect
Tokiko at all costs.

451
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:06,286
-You know what?

452
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:08,819
I think I'm gonna get
along with you after all.

453
00:21:08,852 --> 00:21:09,819
-Huh?

454
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:10,986
-We should shake on it.

455
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:12,286
-I don't think so.

456
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:14,386
-OK, I was still able
to make a withdrawal.

457
00:21:14,419 --> 00:21:16,619
We shouldn't have to worry
about money for a while.

458
00:21:16,652 --> 00:21:17,752
Careful.

459
00:21:17,786 --> 00:21:19,586
If your hand gets wet,
your wound won't heal.

460
00:21:19,619 --> 00:21:20,552
-Oh.

461
00:21:20,586 --> 00:21:23,019
-Excuse me.

462
00:21:23,052 --> 00:21:25,719
-All right, let's go.

463
00:21:25,752 --> 00:21:27,219
-Gota, stop pushing.

464
00:21:27,252 --> 00:21:28,852
-Should we buy another umbrella?

465
00:21:28,886 --> 00:21:32,686
-No, we're fine like this.

466
00:21:32,719 --> 00:21:33,886
-Hey!

467
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:36,119
I'm receiving a message
from undercover agent Ouka!

468
00:21:36,152 --> 00:21:36,652
What is it?

469
00:21:36,686 --> 00:21:37,586
What is it?

470
00:21:37,619 --> 00:21:38,219
What?

471
00:21:38,252 --> 00:21:39,119
Be happy, Pappy!

472
00:21:39,152 --> 00:21:40,552
Kazuki's still alive!

473
00:21:40,586 --> 00:21:42,586
-Hm?

474
00:21:42,619 --> 00:21:44,086
Just as I thought.

475
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:46,286
[gasp]

476
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:48,086
-Are you OK?

477
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:50,652
-I just felt a monstrous chill.

478
00:21:50,686 --> 00:21:52,019
What happened?

479
00:21:52,052 --> 00:21:52,552
Angel Gozen.

480
00:21:52,586 --> 00:21:54,352
Angel Gozen!

481
00:21:54,386 --> 00:21:57,786
-I know we arrived a bit
late, but after all, we've

482
00:21:57,819 --> 00:21:59,819
come all the way to the beach.

483
00:21:59,852 --> 00:22:03,819
It would be a shame not to show
off my super fabulous swimsuit.

484
00:22:03,852 --> 00:22:06,419
The Alchemist Army may know
more about the black Kakugane,

485
00:22:06,452 --> 00:22:10,419
but when it comes to Muto, I
know far more than they do.

486
00:22:10,452 --> 00:22:14,119
He'll never give up, and
won't be so easy to kill.

487
00:22:14,152 --> 00:22:17,152
I estimate 41 days
until Kazuki Muto

488
00:22:17,186 --> 00:22:18,752
ceases to be a human being.

489
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,766
[theme music]

490
00:23:55,063 --> 00:23:56,663
TOKIKO: I'm sure if
we go to the place

491
00:23:56,696 --> 00:23:59,363
where I found that Kakugane,
we'll learn something.

492
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:00,863
I'll cure Kazuki.

493
00:24:00,896 --> 00:24:03,763
And to do that, I'll defeat
anyone who stands in our way,

494
00:24:03,796 --> 00:24:05,296
no matter who they are.

495
00:24:05,329 --> 00:24:07,196
Next time, The Escape.

496
00:24:07,229 --> 00:24:09,263
I'll splatter your guts!

497
00:24:13,696 --> 00:24:17,563
-Mahiro Muto's Buso
Renkin seminar.

498
00:24:17,596 --> 00:24:18,763
Hello, there.

499
00:24:18,796 --> 00:24:20,429
This is Mahiro Muto.

500
00:24:20,463 --> 00:24:22,663
For this seminar, I'll
be a bit more serious

501
00:24:22,696 --> 00:24:24,929
as introduce
today's Buso Renkin.

502
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:27,529
Even I take things
seriously once in a while.

503
00:24:27,563 --> 00:24:28,863
Oh, no, no, no!

504
00:24:28,896 --> 00:24:31,163
I mean, I always take
things seriously.

505
00:24:31,196 --> 00:24:33,929
Now then, for our
sixth seminar, let

506
00:24:33,963 --> 00:24:37,496
me introduce Victor's Buso
Renkin, the Fatal Attraction.

507
00:24:37,529 --> 00:24:39,363
Thanks to the work
of Dr. Butterfly,

508
00:24:39,396 --> 00:24:41,796
Victor, the former
Alchemist Warrior,

509
00:24:41,829 --> 00:24:44,463
has awakened from
his long slumber.

510
00:24:44,496 --> 00:24:46,563
I don't know all the
details, but Victor,

511
00:24:46,596 --> 00:24:49,129
who has a black Kakugane,
embedded within his chest,

512
00:24:49,163 --> 00:24:52,729
is supposed to be a third entity
that surpasses both Homunculus

513
00:24:52,763 --> 00:24:54,063
and humans.

514
00:24:54,096 --> 00:24:56,196
And a black Kakugane
is something

515
00:24:56,229 --> 00:24:59,729
that the Alchemist Army
came up with 100 years ago,

516
00:24:59,763 --> 00:25:02,796
in an attempt to create
the Philosopher's Stone.

517
00:25:02,829 --> 00:25:06,463
It's a very scary thingy
that causes the user's power

518
00:25:06,496 --> 00:25:09,663
to go out of control
and bring destruction.

519
00:25:09,696 --> 00:25:13,196
On top of that, it brings
death to all living beings

520
00:25:13,229 --> 00:25:16,163
by sucking away its life force.

521
00:25:16,196 --> 00:25:19,096
That time when the Homunculi
attacked Ginsei Academy

522
00:25:19,129 --> 00:25:23,096
and Victor awakened, all of us
felt our strength leaving us.

523
00:25:23,129 --> 00:25:26,429
I thought for sure
that we were done for,

524
00:25:26,463 --> 00:25:31,296
but that was all because
of Victor's energy drain.

525
00:25:31,329 --> 00:25:34,129
Victor's Buso Renkin
is a giant axe

526
00:25:34,163 --> 00:25:37,363
that is activated from
the black Kakugane.

527
00:25:37,396 --> 00:25:40,063
Simply put, the giant
axe emits a power

528
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:41,296
called the Fatal Attraction.

529
00:25:41,329 --> 00:25:45,629
But what's amazing is that
it can control gravity.

530
00:25:45,663 --> 00:25:49,229
Whatever attack it takes will
be cancelled out by shifting

531
00:25:49,263 --> 00:25:51,129
the gravitational
power and direction.

532
00:25:51,163 --> 00:25:54,529
And it will destroy things
by twisting and warping it.

533
00:25:54,563 --> 00:25:56,963
Everything gets squashed.

534
00:25:56,996 --> 00:25:57,929
How scary!

535
00:26:01,329 --> 00:26:04,496
Everyone thinks that
Victor is completely evil.

536
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:06,663
But you know, it
seems like he's had

537
00:26:06,696 --> 00:26:09,629
a very tragic past, as well.

538
00:26:09,663 --> 00:26:12,429
Oh, I really hope my big brother
can resolve everything soon,

539
00:26:12,463 --> 00:26:16,763
so everyone can live
happily ever after!

540
00:26:16,796 --> 00:26:21,129
Okie dokie, see you next time!
