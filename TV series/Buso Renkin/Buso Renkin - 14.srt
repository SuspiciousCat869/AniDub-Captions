NARRATOR: The supernatural
alloy produced

2
00:00:14,533 --> 00:00:18,900
by gathering the essence
of alchemy is the Kakugane.

3
00:00:18,933 --> 00:00:22,833
This device activates upon a
person's fighting instinct,

4
00:00:22,866 --> 00:00:25,433
manifesting the
possessor's inner power

5
00:00:25,466 --> 00:00:30,100
into a tangible form, creating
a weapon like no other.

6
00:00:30,133 --> 00:00:31,833
Its name, Buso Renkin.

00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:41,166
[theme music]

8
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:17,049
-My ears hurt!

9
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:20,549
-What's that sound?

10
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:22,549
-The alarm.

11
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:26,049
He, my friend, has awakened.

12
00:02:36,516 --> 00:02:38,483
-What the--

13
00:02:38,516 --> 00:02:39,483
-Angel Gozen!

14
00:02:39,516 --> 00:02:41,483
-I-- feel weak--

15
00:02:41,516 --> 00:02:42,483
-Suddenly I--

16
00:02:42,516 --> 00:02:43,483
-Chii-chin!

17
00:02:43,516 --> 00:02:44,983
Sally!

18
00:02:45,016 --> 00:02:46,483
What--

19
00:02:46,516 --> 00:02:49,449
[groaning]

20
00:02:49,483 --> 00:02:50,949
-It's like--

21
00:02:50,983 --> 00:02:53,949
-My strength is being
sucked out of me.

22
00:02:53,983 --> 00:02:55,949
DR. BUTTERFLY: This
is how he feeds.

23
00:02:55,983 --> 00:02:57,916
He doesn't bother eating flesh.

24
00:02:57,949 --> 00:03:00,883
That has very poor
absorption efficienty.

25
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:03,183
He takes away the
life force directly

26
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:06,183
and transforms it into
energy for himself.

27
00:03:06,216 --> 00:03:08,016
-This is bad, KazukI!

28
00:03:08,049 --> 00:03:10,516
If we don't do
something quickly,

29
00:03:10,549 --> 00:03:14,516
everyone will have their
lives drained out of them!

30
00:03:14,549 --> 00:03:15,649
-I won't let that happen.

31
00:03:15,683 --> 00:03:16,683
No!

32
00:03:16,716 --> 00:03:18,183
DR. BUTTERFLY: Be
quiet, insolent boy.

33
00:03:18,216 --> 00:03:21,616
That line belongs to Dr.
Butterfly, now renamed

34
00:03:21,649 --> 00:03:23,216
Master Butterfly!

35
00:03:23,249 --> 00:03:23,716
Ah!

36
00:03:26,616 --> 00:03:28,016
-There is no need
to follow through

37
00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:30,849
with the order Muto had
made, now, is there?

38
00:03:30,883 --> 00:03:33,349
If you're going to go
along with anything at all,

39
00:03:33,383 --> 00:03:35,183
we should just do it my way.

40
00:03:35,216 --> 00:03:37,416
I got that on my own,
without any help.

41
00:03:37,449 --> 00:03:39,449
However, there is
something I'm still

42
00:03:39,483 --> 00:03:41,749
grateful for, Great Grandfather.

43
00:03:41,783 --> 00:03:44,416
But as for you protecting
me, it's kind of bothersome

44
00:03:44,449 --> 00:03:45,949
that you believe I am that weak.

45
00:03:45,983 --> 00:03:48,316
I don't need your
protection, anyway.

46
00:03:48,349 --> 00:03:50,783
And to prove it, it'll
cost you your life.

47
00:03:50,816 --> 00:03:52,716
-Are you rebelling against me?

48
00:03:52,749 --> 00:03:54,883
Then that means your
death has been ordained.

49
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:56,283
-Really?

50
00:03:56,316 --> 00:03:58,816
I've already learned the special
property of your Buso Renkin.

51
00:03:58,849 --> 00:04:00,783
It affects the nervous
system and disrupts

52
00:04:00,816 --> 00:04:02,349
one's sense of direction.

53
00:04:02,383 --> 00:04:05,049
You're no match for my
Near Death Happiness.

54
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:06,449
-You are such a fool.

55
00:04:06,483 --> 00:04:10,149
You've only seen my Buso
Reinkin in a diffused state.

56
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:12,916
Its power in a concentrated
state is simply unimaginable.

57
00:04:12,949 --> 00:04:17,749
Prepare yourself for the
true power of my Buso Renkin!

58
00:04:17,783 --> 00:04:21,683
I'll crush your mind and spirit,
killing you little by little.

59
00:04:21,716 --> 00:04:24,316
-Before that, I'll
burn you to ashes!

60
00:04:24,349 --> 00:04:25,649
[laughter]

61
00:04:25,683 --> 00:04:30,116
-Someone like you has no chance,
and you want to know why?

62
00:04:30,149 --> 00:04:30,983
Let me explain.

63
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:37,349
-That may have been true
when we were still humans.

64
00:04:37,383 --> 00:04:40,283
Things are differet now.

65
00:04:40,316 --> 00:04:43,716
Completely different.

66
00:04:43,749 --> 00:04:46,116
My name is Papillon!

67
00:04:53,949 --> 00:04:57,949
And you say it surpasses
both humans and Homunculi.

68
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:00,083
I was convinced the
humanoid Homunculus

69
00:05:00,116 --> 00:05:02,116
was the ultimate life form.

70
00:05:02,149 --> 00:05:05,549
But now you tell me there's
something even greater.

71
00:05:09,116 --> 00:05:10,149
I've decided.

72
00:05:10,183 --> 00:05:13,483
I'll cast off this
imperfect body of mine,

73
00:05:13,516 --> 00:05:16,983
and flap my wings toward
even greater heights.

74
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:20,416
Great Grandfather, we are
alike, yet so difficult.

75
00:05:20,449 --> 00:05:21,949
You flutter arround
a dazzling light,

76
00:05:21,983 --> 00:05:24,283
unable to fly high alone.

77
00:05:24,316 --> 00:05:27,483
As far as I'm concerned,
you're no butterfly.

78
00:05:27,516 --> 00:05:29,249
You're just an ugly moth.

79
00:05:29,283 --> 00:05:30,616
-Don't stop, Kazuki!

80
00:05:30,649 --> 00:05:31,249
-I know.

81
00:05:31,283 --> 00:05:32,449
Let's keep moving.

82
00:05:32,483 --> 00:05:34,716
-We have to get up to the
roof as fast as we can.

83
00:05:34,749 --> 00:05:36,816
We cannot waste one second.

84
00:05:36,849 --> 00:05:38,216
-I know!

85
00:05:38,249 --> 00:05:39,583
KAZUKI (VOICEOVER):
I know, but--

86
00:05:42,249 --> 00:05:44,449
-Kazuki, what is it?

87
00:05:44,483 --> 00:05:44,949
This is--

88
00:05:47,783 --> 00:05:49,249
-My friends.

89
00:05:49,283 --> 00:05:50,416
-Kazuki!

90
00:05:50,449 --> 00:05:52,249
Don't open it, Kazuki.

91
00:05:52,283 --> 00:05:54,449
I know what you're
feeling, but it's important

92
00:05:54,483 --> 00:05:55,949
that we keep moving.

93
00:05:55,983 --> 00:05:57,049
Don't open it.

94
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:58,783
TOKIKO (VOICEOVER):
If you open that door,

95
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:01,149
you won't be able to go on.

96
00:06:01,183 --> 00:06:02,916
-I'm sorry.

97
00:06:02,949 --> 00:06:05,383
I just can't-- pass right by.

98
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:05,883
-Kazuki!

99
00:06:17,716 --> 00:06:19,416
-I thought I heard
a voice out here.

100
00:06:19,449 --> 00:06:20,683
I figured it was you.

101
00:06:20,716 --> 00:06:22,383
-Okakura!

102
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:23,749
-Are you all OK?

103
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:24,683
-Yeah.

104
00:06:24,716 --> 00:06:26,583
-What about the
rest of the class?

105
00:06:26,616 --> 00:06:30,516
-Well, everyone should be fine.

106
00:06:30,549 --> 00:06:31,483
-Don't go in there.

107
00:06:36,516 --> 00:06:40,583
Like Daihama said,
everyone's OK.

108
00:06:40,616 --> 00:06:43,283
Don't worry.

109
00:06:43,316 --> 00:06:45,083
-Yeah, but--

110
00:06:45,116 --> 00:06:46,349
-Really.

111
00:06:46,383 --> 00:06:49,116
You don't have to go to the
trouble of looking inside.

112
00:06:49,149 --> 00:06:51,916
There's no need to go in.

113
00:06:51,949 --> 00:06:53,016
-But I--

114
00:06:53,049 --> 00:06:55,449
-With all that happened,
they had a little more

115
00:06:55,483 --> 00:06:57,249
of a frightening
experience than the others,

116
00:06:57,283 --> 00:06:59,249
so they look a bit shaken.

117
00:06:59,283 --> 00:07:01,783
We were just on our way
to the nurses' office.

118
00:07:01,816 --> 00:07:04,449
Really, they're OK.

119
00:07:04,483 --> 00:07:04,949
-But--

120
00:07:08,116 --> 00:07:10,483
-If we're saying we're
OK, then we're OK!

121
00:07:10,516 --> 00:07:12,349
Just shut up and get going.

122
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:14,216
There are still monsters
out there, right?

123
00:07:14,249 --> 00:07:17,116
Aren't you guys supposed to be
the only ones who can defeat

124
00:07:17,149 --> 00:07:19,483
them?

125
00:07:19,516 --> 00:07:22,316
We're all counting on
you, do you understand?

126
00:07:22,349 --> 00:07:25,016
So for everyone's
sake, listen to me.

127
00:07:25,049 --> 00:07:27,383
-I'll fight.

128
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:28,316
-All right.

129
00:07:28,349 --> 00:07:31,949
I just knew you'd
say that, buddy.

130
00:07:31,983 --> 00:07:33,583
So go out and kick their butts.

131
00:07:33,616 --> 00:07:35,749
Go fight, and win for all of us!

132
00:07:40,283 --> 00:07:42,649
-Tokiko!

133
00:07:42,683 --> 00:07:44,983
-Huh?

134
00:07:45,016 --> 00:07:49,283
-Please take care
of my big brother.

135
00:07:49,316 --> 00:07:54,016
Sometimes he tends to
push himself too much.

136
00:07:54,049 --> 00:07:54,649
-I know.

137
00:07:57,983 --> 00:08:00,149
OKAKURA: He can be
such a pain sometimes.

138
00:08:00,183 --> 00:08:00,883
DAIHAMA: Oh, well.

139
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:03,816
That's Kazuki for you.

140
00:08:03,849 --> 00:08:05,516
-We should get going.

141
00:08:05,549 --> 00:08:06,216
-Yeah.

142
00:08:06,249 --> 00:08:07,416
You're right.

143
00:08:07,449 --> 00:08:12,483
We should get these girls
to the nurse-- nurse's--

144
00:08:12,516 --> 00:08:14,483
[groan]

145
00:08:17,249 --> 00:08:19,416
OKAKURA (VOICEOVER): So go
out and kick their butts.

146
00:08:19,449 --> 00:08:21,383
Go fight, and win for all of us!

147
00:08:30,849 --> 00:08:31,883
-Kazuki?

148
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:33,049
-We're taking a shortcut.

149
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:33,549
-What?

150
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:46,416
-You seem to be in quite a
bit of pain, Great, Great

151
00:08:46,449 --> 00:08:46,916
Grandfather.

152
00:08:50,683 --> 00:08:52,916
If you'll tell me about
the man in the flask,

153
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,783
I might find some
compassion, and take you

154
00:08:54,816 --> 00:08:56,083
under my protection.

155
00:08:56,116 --> 00:08:57,916
-Ha ha ha.

156
00:08:57,949 --> 00:08:59,749
-Sarcastic bastard.

157
00:08:59,783 --> 00:09:02,549
Nice choice of words,
considering you've

158
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:05,883
already made a huge
hole in my emblem mark.

159
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:07,083
Oh, very well.

160
00:09:07,116 --> 00:09:10,883
I will tell you, and not
because you are my relative,

161
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:13,483
but because you are a
fellow alchemist striving

162
00:09:13,516 --> 00:09:15,483
for greater heights.

163
00:09:15,516 --> 00:09:16,849
-Hm?

164
00:09:16,883 --> 00:09:18,116
-Victor.

165
00:09:18,149 --> 00:09:22,649
He was originally an alchemist
warrior many years ago.

166
00:09:22,683 --> 00:09:25,316
100 years, to be exact.

167
00:09:25,349 --> 00:09:28,116
He turned into the
third type of being

168
00:09:28,149 --> 00:09:30,949
that surpasses both
humans and Homunculi.

169
00:09:30,983 --> 00:09:35,416
He was pursued by his comrades,
and after a fierce battle,

170
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:37,649
he sought exile here.

171
00:09:37,683 --> 00:09:41,549
In exchange for sharing his
alchemy knowledge with me,

172
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:45,383
I promised to restore his
severely wounded body,

173
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:47,783
regardless of how
long it wold take me.

174
00:09:47,816 --> 00:09:50,649
-I've heard that
whole story already.

175
00:09:50,683 --> 00:09:53,349
It seems you've
gone senile on me.

176
00:09:53,383 --> 00:09:57,249
-Don't rush an old man
telling a complex story.

177
00:09:57,283 --> 00:09:58,516
-Ah?

178
00:09:58,549 --> 00:10:01,583
-For the next hundred
years, my only purpose

179
00:10:01,616 --> 00:10:03,583
was to become the
best alchemist I

180
00:10:03,616 --> 00:10:07,916
could be, in order to
perfect my original creation.

181
00:10:07,949 --> 00:10:10,983
The Restoration Flask.

182
00:10:11,016 --> 00:10:14,716
I also created the LXE
in order to protect him

183
00:10:14,749 --> 00:10:16,949
from the Alchemist Warriors.

184
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:20,749
-So tell me, why was he
pursued by his comrades?

185
00:10:20,783 --> 00:10:22,116
-I don't know.

186
00:10:22,149 --> 00:10:24,149
Try asking him for yourself.

187
00:10:24,183 --> 00:10:26,149
-What is his ultimate goal?

188
00:10:26,183 --> 00:10:27,316
-I don't know.

189
00:10:27,349 --> 00:10:29,616
Only he can answer that.

190
00:10:29,649 --> 00:10:31,849
-How can I become like him?

191
00:10:31,883 --> 00:10:34,083
-You'll have to figure
that out for yourself.

192
00:10:34,116 --> 00:10:37,649
-What is this, I will tell
you, you stinking old man?

193
00:10:37,683 --> 00:10:41,083
Your complex story didn't
answer anything at all.

194
00:10:41,116 --> 00:10:42,849
-Well, what do you expect?

195
00:10:42,883 --> 00:10:45,716
I am nothing but an ugly moth.

196
00:10:45,749 --> 00:10:47,349
Isn't that what you said?

197
00:10:47,383 --> 00:10:49,483
You see, moths are
attracted to the light,

198
00:10:49,516 --> 00:10:51,449
but it is presumptuous
for a moth

199
00:10:51,483 --> 00:10:53,616
to attempt to touch the light.

200
00:10:53,649 --> 00:10:56,349
As an alchemist and
as a friend, I've

201
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:59,216
been completely
fascinated by him.

202
00:10:59,249 --> 00:11:03,316
Restoring him is enough
fulfillment for a lifetime.

203
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:09,949
Mm.

204
00:11:09,983 --> 00:11:12,649
Like a good moth, I
am satisfied to have

205
00:11:12,683 --> 00:11:15,716
been able to fly about
his bright light.

206
00:11:15,749 --> 00:11:18,549
-And how would you ever
expect to become a butterfly

207
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:20,849
with that attitude?

208
00:11:20,883 --> 00:11:22,283
-Hm.

209
00:11:22,316 --> 00:11:25,449
Don't miss out, Papillon!

210
00:11:25,483 --> 00:11:25,949
-Kazuki?

211
00:11:37,816 --> 00:11:40,983
MASTER BUTTERFLY: If you wish
to truly fly to further heights

212
00:11:41,016 --> 00:11:44,383
as a butterfly, then
don't take your eyes

213
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:47,449
off the battle that
is about to happen

214
00:11:47,483 --> 00:11:53,183
between him and
that warrior boy.

215
00:11:53,216 --> 00:11:56,549
It seems during these
100 years, there

216
00:11:56,583 --> 00:12:03,983
were powers I wasn't aware of.

217
00:12:07,016 --> 00:12:07,816
-Energy!

218
00:12:07,849 --> 00:12:08,383
Full blast!

219
00:12:13,549 --> 00:12:14,483
Pierce through!

220
00:12:31,372 --> 00:12:32,339
Pierce through!

221
00:12:44,272 --> 00:12:45,439
-Good morning.

222
00:12:45,472 --> 00:12:48,906
And who are you?

223
00:12:48,939 --> 00:12:51,272
KAZUKI (VOICEOVER): The Sunlight
Heart didn't pierce him.

224
00:12:51,306 --> 00:12:53,072
Not even a single inch.

225
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:54,639
-A Buso Renkin?

226
00:12:54,672 --> 00:12:55,939
An Alchemist Warrior, hm?

227
00:13:00,939 --> 00:13:02,239
How fragile.

228
00:13:02,272 --> 00:13:03,906
You lack training.

229
00:13:03,939 --> 00:13:04,406
-Kazuki!

230
00:13:14,572 --> 00:13:17,306
TOKIKO (VOICEOVER):
Pale blue glowing hair.

231
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:20,539
Olive skin that radiates heat.

232
00:13:20,572 --> 00:13:24,172
A muscular giant,
nearly seven feet tall.

233
00:13:24,206 --> 00:13:25,506
He is--

234
00:13:25,539 --> 00:13:27,439
-The third type of
being that exceeds

235
00:13:27,472 --> 00:13:30,339
both humans and Homunculi.

236
00:13:30,372 --> 00:13:32,272
Oh?

237
00:13:32,306 --> 00:13:34,872
MASTER BUTTERFLY: Good morning.

238
00:13:34,906 --> 00:13:38,106
Good morning, Victor.

239
00:13:44,372 --> 00:13:47,306
-Goodnight, Butterfly.

240
00:13:47,339 --> 00:13:52,139
Death awaits all those
who practice alchemy.

241
00:13:52,172 --> 00:13:54,006
[coughing]

242
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:56,739
-So this is an energy drain.

243
00:13:56,772 --> 00:13:58,239
-Even though we
destroyed his flask,

244
00:13:58,272 --> 00:14:00,839
he still continues
to get stronger.

245
00:14:00,872 --> 00:14:03,039
If this goes on, none
of us will make it.

246
00:14:03,072 --> 00:14:03,906
KAZUKI: Stop this!

247
00:14:12,939 --> 00:14:14,439
-Impossible.

248
00:14:14,472 --> 00:14:16,572
This is like breathing for me.

249
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:19,506
It is not my power,
but my biology.

250
00:14:19,539 --> 00:14:22,272
I can't stop it
even if I wanted to.

251
00:14:22,306 --> 00:14:24,339
-Then how can it be stopped?

252
00:14:24,372 --> 00:14:31,606
-If you want to stop it,
then you must kill me.

253
00:14:36,072 --> 00:14:38,239
Do you think you can do that?

254
00:14:46,239 --> 00:14:49,439
So you'll fight me?

255
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:50,706
Very well.

256
00:14:50,739 --> 00:14:53,006
Of course I never would
have let an Alchemist

257
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:55,806
Warrior live anyway.

258
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:58,539
-I'll kill every
single one of you.

259
00:14:58,572 --> 00:15:03,339
-He hates us all.

260
00:15:03,372 --> 00:15:06,206
-If I don't fight,
everyone will die!

261
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,972
Energy, full blast.

262
00:15:08,006 --> 00:15:09,439
Full blast.

263
00:15:09,472 --> 00:15:10,439
Full blast!

264
00:15:10,472 --> 00:15:13,906
Full blast!

265
00:15:13,939 --> 00:15:14,906
Here I come.

266
00:15:14,939 --> 00:15:15,806
Sunlight Crasher!

267
00:15:27,872 --> 00:15:28,972
TOKIKO (VOICEOVER): Kazuki.

268
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:32,939
TOKIKO: Kazuki!

269
00:15:39,406 --> 00:15:39,872
Victor!

270
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:05,639
Kazuki?

271
00:16:05,672 --> 00:16:08,106
-Let's go.

272
00:16:08,139 --> 00:16:09,106
-Yes.

273
00:16:09,139 --> 00:16:10,606
Victor!

274
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,772
-Unless we defeat him
now, everyone will die!

275
00:16:19,606 --> 00:16:20,072
-Useless.

276
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:35,506
-Tokiko.

277
00:16:35,539 --> 00:16:36,006
Victor!

278
00:16:42,006 --> 00:16:43,472
-I said it was useless.

279
00:16:49,939 --> 00:16:52,472
-Kazuki.

280
00:16:52,506 --> 00:16:55,572
TOKIKO (VOICEOVER): Is power
building up inside him, again?

281
00:16:55,606 --> 00:16:59,272
-Who are you?

282
00:16:59,306 --> 00:17:01,739
Whoever you are, it
seems I better not

283
00:17:01,772 --> 00:17:04,506
fight you empty handed.

284
00:17:04,539 --> 00:17:07,706
Then I too shall
use my Buso Renkin!

285
00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:12,806
TOKIKO (VOICEOVER):
What is that?

286
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:17,372
I've never even heard anything
about a black Kakugane.

287
00:17:17,406 --> 00:17:19,539
[groan]

288
00:17:22,239 --> 00:17:23,172
-Fatal Attraction.

289
00:17:26,106 --> 00:17:30,406
TOKIKO (VOICEOVER):
What the-- what is that?

290
00:17:30,439 --> 00:17:31,406
-Kazuki, don't!

291
00:17:31,439 --> 00:17:33,306
This guy's an
unknown entity to us.

292
00:17:33,339 --> 00:17:35,706
We should just stall him until
the Warrior Chief arrives.

293
00:17:35,739 --> 00:17:36,806
-No way.

294
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:39,572
No one here, even you,
will last that long.

295
00:17:39,606 --> 00:17:43,006
I know I can at least
injure him somehow.

296
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,339
Maybe I can wear him
down little by little!

297
00:17:57,139 --> 00:18:00,072
-Here is your new life.

298
00:18:23,372 --> 00:18:24,572
-He died in vain.

299
00:18:32,672 --> 00:18:35,206
[shout]

300
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,639
-Hmph.

301
00:18:36,672 --> 00:18:38,572
[groan]

302
00:18:43,406 --> 00:18:44,039
-Damn you.

303
00:18:46,872 --> 00:18:49,472
-The closer you get to
me, the faster your energy

304
00:18:49,506 --> 00:18:51,106
will be drained.

305
00:18:51,139 --> 00:18:52,739
What a disgrace.

306
00:18:52,772 --> 00:18:56,572
The Warriors a century ago
were much more composed.

307
00:18:56,606 --> 00:18:58,872
All those who choose
the Warrior path

308
00:18:58,906 --> 00:19:02,172
should be prepared for their
inevitable death in battle.

309
00:19:02,206 --> 00:19:03,072
-You're wrong!

310
00:19:03,106 --> 00:19:05,406
Kazuki's different.

311
00:19:05,439 --> 00:19:07,439
Kazuki was just an
ordinary high school.

312
00:19:11,072 --> 00:19:15,872
And on that spring night
two months ago, I-- I

313
00:19:15,906 --> 00:19:17,272
dragged him into battle.

314
00:19:24,706 --> 00:19:26,139
And I got him--

315
00:19:40,606 --> 00:19:41,906
KAZUKI (VOICEOVER): Tokiko?

316
00:19:41,939 --> 00:19:43,739
Is that you crying?

317
00:19:43,772 --> 00:19:47,806
I have to-- keep fighting.

318
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:51,639
-You think you're the
reason he got killed?

319
00:19:51,672 --> 00:19:55,972
If that's how you feel,
I'll send you to join him.

320
00:19:56,006 --> 00:19:59,972
Living alone and dying
alone is a tragic thing.

321
00:20:05,339 --> 00:20:09,172
[thumping]

322
00:20:09,206 --> 00:20:10,672
-What was that?

323
00:20:10,706 --> 00:20:11,172
-Huh?

324
00:20:17,406 --> 00:20:20,139
TOKIKO (VOICEOVER): Kazuki's
Kakugane is pulsating.

325
00:20:28,039 --> 00:20:28,706
-Kazuki.

326
00:20:28,739 --> 00:20:30,006
KAZUKI: I will fight.

327
00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:30,806
-Huh?

328
00:20:30,839 --> 00:20:32,772
-I will fight.

329
00:20:32,806 --> 00:20:34,439
-Kazuki.

330
00:20:34,472 --> 00:20:36,406
-I will fight.

331
00:20:36,439 --> 00:20:37,906
I will fight.

332
00:20:37,939 --> 00:20:39,372
I will fight.

333
00:20:39,406 --> 00:20:42,839
I will fight.

334
00:20:42,872 --> 00:20:44,339
PAPILLON: Damn it.

335
00:20:44,372 --> 00:20:48,272
What's happening up there?

336
00:20:48,306 --> 00:20:49,772
Mm?

337
00:20:49,806 --> 00:20:52,739
Butterfly's Kakugane.

338
00:20:52,772 --> 00:20:54,239
Just perfect.

339
00:20:54,272 --> 00:20:55,972
I'll use this one
to heal myself.

340
00:21:01,072 --> 00:21:02,972
-I will fight.

341
00:21:03,006 --> 00:21:04,239
I will fight.

342
00:21:04,272 --> 00:21:05,706
I will fight.

343
00:21:05,739 --> 00:21:07,206
TOKIKO (VOICEOVER): Kazuki?

344
00:21:07,239 --> 00:21:08,706
-I will fight.

345
00:21:08,739 --> 00:21:10,672
I will fight.

346
00:21:10,706 --> 00:21:12,272
I will fight.

347
00:21:12,306 --> 00:21:14,206
Fight me!

348
00:21:15,201 --> 00:21:15,668
-Kazuki!

349
00:21:29,368 --> 00:21:33,434
-The only one to die
alone, Victor, is you.

350
00:21:33,468 --> 00:21:34,901
-I see.

351
00:21:34,934 --> 00:21:37,101
You're the same as as me.

352
00:21:37,134 --> 00:21:41,534
So you also traded your
life for the black Kakugane.

353
00:21:41,568 --> 00:21:44,868
TOKIKO (VOICEOVER): That
spring night two months ago.

354
00:21:44,901 --> 00:21:47,268
What did I do to you, Kazuki?

355
00:21:47,301 --> 00:21:50,501
What have I done?

356
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:56,466
[theme music]

357
00:23:25,227 --> 00:23:27,894
TOKIKO: I will make it up
to you in any way I can,

358
00:23:27,927 --> 00:23:29,660
for turning you into this.

359
00:23:29,694 --> 00:23:32,760
So please, Kazuki, don't
let your heart change.

360
00:23:32,794 --> 00:23:36,327
Next time, An
Intermediate Existence.

361
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,394
I'll splatter your guts!

362
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,927
-Hi, everyone!

363
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,294
This is Mahiro Muto.

364
00:23:46,327 --> 00:23:50,027
I'm back to properly introduce
you to another Buso Renkin.

365
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:53,860
For our fifth presentation, we
have the Near Death Happiness.

366
00:23:53,894 --> 00:23:54,894
Yes, that's right.

367
00:23:54,927 --> 00:23:57,594
The Buso Renkin of
that Butterfly weirdo.

368
00:23:57,627 --> 00:23:59,460
Oh sorry, no no, I
mean Mr. Papillon.

369
00:23:59,494 --> 00:24:00,860
Or better yet, Pappy.

370
00:24:00,894 --> 00:24:03,260
I like that better.

371
00:24:03,294 --> 00:24:06,660
Anyway, his name as a
human was Koushaku Chouno,

372
00:24:06,694 --> 00:24:09,927
but now that he's become
a humanoid Homunculi,

373
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:13,127
the only one who can call him
by that name is my big brother.

374
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:18,560
Is that the relationship of
enemies, rivals, or friends?

375
00:24:18,594 --> 00:24:21,560
I don't really get
it, but it seems

376
00:24:21,594 --> 00:24:24,060
they have a very deep bond.

377
00:24:24,094 --> 00:24:25,027
Hm.

378
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:26,294
Oh, well.

379
00:24:26,327 --> 00:24:29,360
Pappy was very sickly back
when he was a human being,

380
00:24:29,394 --> 00:24:31,727
but after doing continuous
research on the Homunculi,

381
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,860
he succeeded in becoming a
humanoid Homunculus himself.

382
00:24:34,894 --> 00:24:39,427
He even obtained a Kakugane,
and now can use a Buso Renkin.

383
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:41,760
It's called Near
Death Happiness,

384
00:24:41,794 --> 00:24:44,294
which is a Buso Renkin
of black powder.

385
00:24:44,327 --> 00:24:47,160
See those butterfly wings
with black specks growing out

386
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:48,294
of Pappy's back?

387
00:24:48,327 --> 00:24:50,227
They're actually
made of gunpowder.

388
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:52,727
The tips of the wings
burn continuously,

389
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:55,194
allowing him to fly.

390
00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:56,694
How cool is that?

391
00:24:56,727 --> 00:24:58,694
I wanna fly, too!

392
00:24:58,727 --> 00:25:02,660
On top of that, the Near Death
Happiness' special property

393
00:25:02,694 --> 00:25:06,427
allows Pappy to fire the black
powder in any shape he wants.

394
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:09,327
And he can also
ignite it at will.

395
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:13,160
That black powder can reach
up to a radius of 164 feet.

396
00:25:13,194 --> 00:25:14,860
But apparently he
can't set it off

397
00:25:14,894 --> 00:25:16,194
unless it's within his eyesight.

398
00:25:16,227 --> 00:25:17,594
Very interesting.

399
00:25:17,627 --> 00:25:21,060
Oh, and by the way, despite
being able to take any shape,

400
00:25:21,094 --> 00:25:23,360
the reason why Pappy
uses the butterfly shape

401
00:25:23,394 --> 00:25:25,794
is because it's just his taste.

402
00:25:25,827 --> 00:25:28,094
Isn't he such a lovely weirdo?

403
00:25:28,127 --> 00:25:31,160
Okie dokie, tune in next time.
