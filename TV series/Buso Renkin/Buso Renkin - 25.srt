NARRATOR: The supernatural
alloy produced

2
00:00:14,566 --> 00:00:18,933
by gathering the essence
of alchemy is the kakugane.

3
00:00:18,966 --> 00:00:22,866
This device activates upon
a person's fighting instinct

4
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,466
manifesting the
possessor's inner power

5
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,100
into a tangible form creating
a weapon like no other.

6
00:00:30,133 --> 00:00:34,200
It's name, Buso Renkin.

[theme music]

8
00:02:19,741 --> 00:02:21,641
-I'm sorry, Tokiko.

9
00:02:22,915 --> 00:02:23,382
-Kazuki!

10
00:02:34,189 --> 00:02:34,656
Kazuki.

11
00:02:37,656 --> 00:02:38,123
Kazuki.

12
00:02:55,344 --> 00:02:58,010
-The two Victors have
indeed disappeared

13
00:02:58,044 --> 00:03:01,577
from the face of the earth and
the crisis is now finally over.

14
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:03,444
But this-- this is--

15
00:03:03,477 --> 00:03:05,810
[laughing]

16
00:03:05,844 --> 00:03:07,744
-That's just the way it is.

17
00:03:07,777 --> 00:03:09,444
That's absurdity for you.

18
00:03:09,477 --> 00:03:11,310
After all, that's
how the world is.

19
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:17,877
That's how it's been, and
how it will always be.

20
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:21,910
-You don't really mean
what you're saying.

21
00:03:21,944 --> 00:03:24,577
I understand the
outcome is upsetting.

22
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:28,444
However, results are results.

23
00:03:28,477 --> 00:03:31,510
No matter how much
sorrow there may be,

24
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:35,244
people's lives will continue
on as if nothing ever happened.

25
00:03:39,877 --> 00:03:43,244
No matter how great
the sorrow may be.

26
00:03:50,044 --> 00:03:51,710
Yet, I believe
everything happened

27
00:03:51,744 --> 00:03:53,310
the way it was supposed to.

28
00:03:53,344 --> 00:03:54,510
-But--

29
00:03:54,544 --> 00:03:56,977
-Rather than dwelling on
the current circumstances,

30
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:59,710
we must focus on
where to go from here.

31
00:03:59,744 --> 00:04:01,977
That is the duty for
those of us left behind.

32
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:04,377
-It's not like you
had to tell me that.

33
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,310
-The aftermath
clean up has begun.

34
00:04:06,344 --> 00:04:09,577
The two of you are going to
have a little more work ahead.

35
00:04:14,777 --> 00:04:17,344
-All right, let's go.

36
00:04:17,377 --> 00:04:18,277
-Yes, sir.

37
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:54,410
GOTA (VOICEOVER): Tokiko.

38
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:14,277
-Hey, where should
we go to next?

39
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:16,744
-Who wants to go
for another drink?

40
00:05:16,777 --> 00:05:17,710
-You're so dirty.

41
00:05:17,744 --> 00:05:18,610
-Hey, taxi.

42
00:05:18,644 --> 00:05:19,310
Taxi.

43
00:05:19,344 --> 00:05:20,544
Stop, you jerk, stop!

44
00:05:39,344 --> 00:05:42,177
-How boring.

45
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:44,844
There's absolutely
nothing here for me.

46
00:05:44,877 --> 00:05:48,544
A world without
Kazuki Muto around

47
00:05:48,577 --> 00:05:50,910
is a dull, pointless,
boring place.

48
00:05:54,677 --> 00:05:56,277
Kazuki Muto.

49
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:13,877
-Hey, come on, Tokiko, it's
time we all go back to school.

50
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:14,844
Everyone understands.

51
00:06:14,877 --> 00:06:17,710
Nobody will say
anything, I promise.

52
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:24,544
-You have to face reality,
Kazuki's gone now.

53
00:06:24,577 --> 00:06:26,410
-I know.

54
00:06:26,444 --> 00:06:28,510
That's why I've been thinking.

55
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:36,744
I've been thinking about
what I can do for Kazuki one

56
00:06:36,777 --> 00:06:39,110
last time before
leaving this city.

57
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:45,544
-Has she been like that
this whole time, Ouka.

58
00:06:45,577 --> 00:06:48,810
-Yes, it's a sign that she's
starting to recover though.

59
00:06:48,844 --> 00:06:51,210
She didn't even speak
at all until today.

60
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:56,110
-I don't blame her after going
through something like that.

61
00:06:56,144 --> 00:06:58,710
Her physical wounds
will eventually heal,

62
00:06:58,744 --> 00:07:01,377
but her wounded heart
might take awhile.

63
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:02,577
-Tokiko.

64
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:05,777
-Regardless of the facts,
we can't just give up.

65
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:08,310
-Kazuki would say the same
thing if he were here.

66
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:10,844
-Kazuki isn't here anymore.

67
00:07:10,877 --> 00:07:13,977
However, there's got to be
something that we can still do.

68
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:14,477
-Yes.

69
00:07:47,377 --> 00:07:58,310
-Wher-- I didn't even know
what to say to her just now.

70
00:07:58,344 --> 00:07:59,744
-It's just as well.

71
00:07:59,777 --> 00:08:01,310
Right now there are
probably no words

72
00:08:01,344 --> 00:08:02,410
that can reach her anyway.

73
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:07,744
-I know, but still.

74
00:08:07,777 --> 00:08:09,944
-No matter what you say,
it will just hurt her.

75
00:08:09,977 --> 00:08:12,777
All we can do now
is watch over her.

76
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:16,577
Weren't you the one who
said that once, Bravo?

77
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:18,744
I'm pretty sure she'll be OK.

78
00:08:18,777 --> 00:08:23,210
I have no doubt she'll be able
to find an answer on her own.

79
00:08:23,244 --> 00:08:24,344
Don't worry.

80
00:08:24,377 --> 00:08:26,644
After all, she was one
of your subordinates,

81
00:08:26,677 --> 00:08:28,544
so I'm sure she'll be OK.

82
00:09:14,944 --> 00:09:16,710
TOKIKO (VOICEOVER):
Kazuki saved this world.

83
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:41,677
Kazuki protected this city with
his own life, but even so, I--

84
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:49,077
-Tokiko.

85
00:10:04,377 --> 00:10:04,844
-Kazuki.

86
00:10:10,144 --> 00:10:14,877
What am I supposed to do?

87
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:15,377
Kazuki!

88
00:10:39,859 --> 00:10:41,892
-I'm a little worried.

89
00:10:41,926 --> 00:10:44,659
Mahiro hasn't been the
same at all since that day,

90
00:10:44,692 --> 00:10:47,292
and Tokiko hasn't
come to school either.

91
00:10:47,326 --> 00:10:49,759
I wonder how she's doing?

92
00:10:49,792 --> 00:10:52,126
-Damn it.

93
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:54,159
What the hell was that?

94
00:10:54,192 --> 00:10:56,926
-The harsh truth is
we are outsiders.

95
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,892
If Bravo hadn't told
us what happened,

96
00:10:58,926 --> 00:11:00,959
we would've still
been kept in the dark.

97
00:11:00,992 --> 00:11:03,526
Shouldn't we accept things
as is and stop wondering?

98
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:04,792
-But Rokumasu.

99
00:11:04,826 --> 00:11:09,526
-But he gave his life to
protect this world, and yet--

100
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:11,726
-Isn't that usually
how it is anyway?

101
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:13,726
The majority of
people everywhere just

102
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:15,959
continue going about
their lives unaware

103
00:11:15,992 --> 00:11:18,659
that something significant
has happened to this world.

104
00:11:18,692 --> 00:11:21,326
That's the way it is, and that's
the way it will always be.

105
00:11:21,359 --> 00:11:23,226
-Stop talking like you
know it all, will ya?

106
00:11:27,192 --> 00:11:28,959
-Kazuki.

107
00:11:28,992 --> 00:11:29,559
-Damn it.

108
00:11:34,059 --> 00:11:34,892
You idiot!

109
00:12:15,092 --> 00:12:15,526
-Yah!

110
00:12:35,059 --> 00:12:38,026
-You shouldn't abuse
your body too much.

111
00:12:38,059 --> 00:12:38,492
-Next.

112
00:12:44,992 --> 00:12:45,459
Ahhhhh!

113
00:13:01,959 --> 00:13:04,292
-Tokiko.

114
00:13:04,326 --> 00:13:05,392
What's going on?

115
00:13:05,426 --> 00:13:07,292
What have you been doing?

116
00:13:07,326 --> 00:13:10,226
Fighting SIM battles
this whole time?

117
00:13:10,259 --> 00:13:14,026
You have, haven't you?

118
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:15,492
Honestly, you've just recovery.

119
00:13:15,526 --> 00:13:17,459
You shouldn't be pushing
yourself like this.

120
00:13:17,492 --> 00:13:20,892
Tokiko, take care of yourself.

121
00:13:20,926 --> 00:13:23,826
-N-- Next.

122
00:13:23,859 --> 00:13:24,792
-Tokiko.

123
00:13:24,826 --> 00:13:25,292
Tokiko.

124
00:13:34,592 --> 00:13:37,659
To be honest, I can't
stand seeing you like this.

125
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:45,092
Please, cheer up.

126
00:13:45,126 --> 00:13:47,826
Whatever it takes,
I'll do anything just

127
00:13:47,859 --> 00:13:49,126
to see smile again.

128
00:13:53,026 --> 00:13:53,492
Tokiko.

129
00:13:57,159 --> 00:13:59,626
-Thanks, Gota, but--

130
00:14:26,259 --> 00:14:27,326
TOKIKO (VOICEOVER): Kazuki.

131
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:56,992
What can I do for you?

132
00:15:14,659 --> 00:15:17,926
-Eventually, I'll settle things
with you once and for all.

133
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:21,359
Until I do, I won't be able to
be myself and truly take off.

134
00:15:21,392 --> 00:15:21,859
-Chouno.

135
00:15:24,892 --> 00:15:27,692
I also plan to settle things
with you once and for all.

136
00:15:34,592 --> 00:15:35,526
-I will settle it.

137
00:15:38,426 --> 00:15:40,659
-How are the missions
in other areas going?

138
00:15:40,692 --> 00:15:42,692
-50% are complete.

139
00:15:42,726 --> 00:15:44,992
The rest are in progress.

140
00:15:45,026 --> 00:15:47,159
We are currently
working on bringing

141
00:15:47,192 --> 00:15:49,459
every confirmed homunculi
under our control.

142
00:15:49,492 --> 00:15:51,192
-Followed by a
gradual suspension

143
00:15:51,226 --> 00:15:53,292
of all alchemist army activity?

144
00:15:53,326 --> 00:15:54,959
Are you serious about that?

145
00:15:54,992 --> 00:15:56,326
-Yes.

146
00:15:56,359 --> 00:15:58,992
I've been having meetings with
armies from various nations.

147
00:15:59,026 --> 00:16:01,426
It's been thousands of
years since alchemy began

148
00:16:01,459 --> 00:16:03,659
and the completion of
the philosopher's stone

149
00:16:03,692 --> 00:16:05,592
is still far away.

150
00:16:05,626 --> 00:16:08,526
In addition, we've not been
able to properly utilize

151
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:11,826
the power we currently have and
we continue to make mistakes.

152
00:16:11,859 --> 00:16:15,226
I believe it is time for us to
take a step back and reexamine

153
00:16:15,259 --> 00:16:16,992
our progress thus far.

154
00:16:17,026 --> 00:16:19,092
-Is that even
possible right now?

155
00:16:19,126 --> 00:16:23,092
-Whether it's possible
or not, it must be done.

156
00:16:23,126 --> 00:16:25,759
It's the least we
can do for those

157
00:16:25,792 --> 00:16:29,626
two warriors up on the moon.

158
00:16:29,659 --> 00:16:31,159
-Great Warrior Chief.

159
00:16:31,192 --> 00:16:34,992
-Warrior Tokiko, what is it?

160
00:16:35,026 --> 00:16:37,826
-Great Warrior Chief,
I have a request.

161
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:17,992
-Tokiko, I heard.

162
00:17:25,226 --> 00:17:28,892
I know about your final mission
to take care of Papillon.

163
00:17:28,926 --> 00:17:30,792
You can count me in.

164
00:17:46,226 --> 00:17:47,826
-Hey, come on, you
guys are so slow.

165
00:17:47,859 --> 00:17:49,926
What the heck took you so long?

166
00:17:49,959 --> 00:17:51,626
I was getting tired of waiting.

167
00:17:51,659 --> 00:17:53,826
-We heard about what you
guys are planning to do.

168
00:17:53,859 --> 00:17:56,792
-And we won't let
you do this alone.

169
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:57,892
-That's right, Tokiko.

170
00:17:57,926 --> 00:17:59,859
We were getting a little
worry too, you know.

171
00:17:59,892 --> 00:18:02,726
I mean, why take off
without even saying a word?

172
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:03,392
Think about it.

173
00:18:03,426 --> 00:18:04,826
That's not very nice.

174
00:18:04,859 --> 00:18:07,059
-Geez, how come you're
so well-informed?

175
00:18:07,092 --> 00:18:08,859
-You really shouldn't
underestimate

176
00:18:08,892 --> 00:18:11,626
my extremely efficient
intelligence network.

177
00:18:11,659 --> 00:18:14,092
-Tokiko, your orders.

178
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:16,126
-Tokiko.

179
00:18:16,159 --> 00:18:18,926
-All right, let's go
to our final mission.

180
00:18:46,226 --> 00:18:47,159
-Tokiko.

181
00:18:47,192 --> 00:18:48,826
Hey, Tokiko.

182
00:18:48,859 --> 00:18:50,792
-We are now in enemy territory.

183
00:18:50,826 --> 00:18:52,959
We must not let our guard down.

184
00:18:52,992 --> 00:18:54,959
-I'm aware of that.

185
00:18:54,992 --> 00:18:55,692
Let's go.

186
00:19:07,892 --> 00:19:11,992
-Hm, if you're going to watch
the moon, do it someplace else.

187
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:14,859
And if you're going to
eat, eat somewhere else.

188
00:19:14,892 --> 00:19:15,726
-Want some?

189
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:16,992
It's my Mama.

190
00:19:17,026 --> 00:19:19,659
Well, actually, it's the
remains of her failed attempt

191
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:21,692
to clone herself.

192
00:19:21,726 --> 00:19:23,792
-It doesn't even
wet my appetite.

193
00:19:23,826 --> 00:19:25,559
-Strange that you say that.

194
00:19:25,592 --> 00:19:28,926
This has been my main diet
for close to 100 years.

195
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:31,959
I'd heard that you didn't have
any urges for cannibalism.

196
00:19:31,992 --> 00:19:34,292
I guess it's true then huh?

197
00:19:34,326 --> 00:19:37,392
The reason a homunculus
has the urge to eat humans,

198
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:39,592
some researchers
say it's attributed

199
00:19:39,626 --> 00:19:41,926
to an instinctive attachment.

200
00:19:41,959 --> 00:19:44,159
In other words,
it's like a desire

201
00:19:44,192 --> 00:19:48,359
to regain the human elements
that it had originally lost.

202
00:19:48,392 --> 00:19:50,859
You don't have any
attachments to human elements,

203
00:19:50,892 --> 00:19:53,326
to the human world,
or to society.

204
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,926
As a homunculus
you are incomplete,

205
00:19:55,959 --> 00:19:58,326
but you've accomplished
what other homunculi haven't

206
00:19:58,359 --> 00:20:02,126
been able to do, breaking
away from being human.

207
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,726
You are something
completely new that's

208
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:05,826
neither human nor homunculus.

209
00:20:05,859 --> 00:20:08,492
You might literally
be a superhuman.

210
00:20:08,526 --> 00:20:11,492
-Go and speak your
nonsense someplace else.

211
00:20:11,526 --> 00:20:12,759
-You're right.

212
00:20:12,792 --> 00:20:15,926
This conversation is probably
nonsense to you and me,

213
00:20:15,959 --> 00:20:19,026
but I will tell you something
relevant for your own good.

214
00:20:19,059 --> 00:20:21,492
The alchemist warriors
are already nearby.

215
00:20:21,526 --> 00:20:22,926
Or did you know that already?

216
00:20:22,959 --> 00:20:24,926
-That's none of your concern.

217
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:28,459
I have prepared an appropriate
welcome for unwanted visitors.

218
00:20:32,826 --> 00:20:34,726
-Long time no see.

219
00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:37,792
-You really did it, didn't you?

220
00:20:37,826 --> 00:20:39,426
-The time has come for revenge.

221
00:20:39,459 --> 00:20:43,326
-Don't even think you're
going to get past here.

222
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:46,192
-Animal type homunculike
created by Papillon.

223
00:20:46,226 --> 00:20:49,092
-Did he recreate them with
Dr. Alexandria's cloning

224
00:20:49,126 --> 00:20:49,926
technology?

225
00:20:49,959 --> 00:20:51,259
-That confirms it.

226
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:53,792
There's no doubt Papillon
was on the other side.

227
00:20:56,859 --> 00:20:59,559
Let's go.

228
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:00,959
-Buso renkin of archery.

229
00:21:04,859 --> 00:21:07,726
-Buso renkin of Katana sword.

230
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:12,259
Sword Samurai X.

231
00:21:12,292 --> 00:21:17,159
-Buso renkin of
chakram, motor gear.

232
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:19,326
-So who's my opponent, huh?

233
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:19,826
Come on.

234
00:21:19,859 --> 00:21:20,392
Come on.

235
00:21:20,426 --> 00:21:21,792
-Out of my way.

236
00:21:27,792 --> 00:21:29,726
-You won't get through.

237
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:32,159
-You won't get through.

238
00:21:32,192 --> 00:21:32,726
-Clones.

239
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:41,559
-Go on ahead, Tokiko.

240
00:21:41,592 --> 00:21:45,092
-I don't think so.

241
00:21:45,126 --> 00:21:47,126
-Tokiko, go ahead.

242
00:21:56,892 --> 00:21:59,292
-So what do you want?

243
00:21:59,326 --> 00:22:02,492
Are you on a mission
to eliminate me?

244
00:22:02,526 --> 00:22:04,959
-No, Papillon,
I've come to settle

245
00:22:04,992 --> 00:22:08,592
things in Kazuki's place.

246
00:22:08,626 --> 00:22:10,892
-No one could ever
take his place.

247
00:22:10,926 --> 00:22:13,792
Are you saying Kazuki
Muto is replaceable?

248
00:22:23,603 --> 00:22:26,637
[theme music]

249
00:23:54,564 --> 00:23:58,464
-Will my heart and
soul reach you?

250
00:23:58,498 --> 00:24:01,264
I want to live with you forever.

251
00:24:01,298 --> 00:24:04,431
Kazuki, thank you.

252
00:24:04,464 --> 00:24:08,498
Next time, the series
finale, "Period."
