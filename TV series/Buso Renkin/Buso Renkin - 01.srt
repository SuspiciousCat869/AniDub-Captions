KAZUKI (VOICEOVER):
It's a dream.

3
00:01:46,048 --> 00:01:47,215
It's got to be a dream.

00:02:04,915 --> 00:02:05,782
-Behind you!

00:02:13,282 --> 00:02:15,748

-What's the matter, Kazuki?

00:02:26,782 --> 00:02:30,648
-Can't you at least try to be
quiet at this time of night?

-Are you still asleep?

00:02:35,548 --> 00:02:37,715

-What's up with them?

18
00:02:44,515 --> 00:02:45,448
They're being so noisy.

19
00:02:45,482 --> 00:02:46,882
-What's going on?

20
00:02:46,915 --> 00:02:50,748
-Seems like some sophomore
year guy is acting up.

It's my big brother.

-He seems to be doing OK.

25
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:04,915
He should be fine, at
least for the time being,

-Hey there.

30
00:03:24,448 --> 00:03:26,415
-I heard the you were
half asleep last night

31
00:03:26,448 --> 00:03:28,315
and went on a crazy
rampage back in the dorm.

32
00:03:28,348 --> 00:03:30,082
-Whoa, word travels fast!

33
00:03:30,115 --> 00:03:31,515
So who's the snitch?

34
00:03:31,548 --> 00:03:32,748
-It was me.

35
00:03:32,782 --> 00:03:33,382
-Okakura!

36
00:03:33,415 --> 00:03:34,315
-Look at this.

37
00:03:34,348 --> 00:03:35,815
I didn't even have
to say anything.

38
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:37,682
These wounds say it all.

39
00:03:37,715 --> 00:03:38,748
-Wowie.

40
00:03:38,782 --> 00:03:40,048
Who'd have thought
that the learn at home

00:03:40,082 --> 00:03:42,448
karate I've been doing since
my first year of junior high

42
00:03:42,482 --> 00:03:44,082
would result in
something so lethal.

43
00:03:44,115 --> 00:03:46,482
That's pretty damn cool.

44
00:03:46,515 --> 00:03:47,882
-Shut up, you idiot.

45
00:03:47,915 --> 00:03:49,048
Apologize!

46
00:03:49,082 --> 00:03:49,815
-Sorry.

47
00:03:49,848 --> 00:03:51,182
-That's better.

DAIHAMA: You sure gave us a
hard time last night, didn't he,

49
00:03:53,682 --> 00:03:54,482
Rokumasu?

50
00:03:54,515 --> 00:03:55,748
-Yeah, that's right.

51
00:03:55,782 --> 00:03:57,482
If Daihama hadn't been
there to stop you,

52
00:03:57,515 --> 00:03:59,548
you might still be
fighting Okakura.

53
00:03:59,582 --> 00:04:00,948
-Sorry about that.

54
00:04:00,982 --> 00:04:03,382
-So tell us, what was
your dream about anyway?

55
00:04:03,415 --> 00:04:04,248
It was weird.

56
00:04:04,282 --> 00:04:06,415
Not only scary, but painful too.

57
00:04:06,448 --> 00:04:08,948
On top of that, I can still
remember every detail.

58
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:10,848
-In the abandoned building
behind the school?

59
00:04:10,882 --> 00:04:12,415
-You mean the haunted factory?

60
00:04:12,448 --> 00:04:13,715
-Right.

61
00:04:13,748 --> 00:04:15,715
There was a girl I didn't
know wearing a school uniform,

62
00:04:15,748 --> 00:04:17,315
and I saved her as
she was about to be

63
00:04:17,348 --> 00:04:19,348
attacked by some
strange creature.

64
00:04:19,382 --> 00:04:21,215
-That is weird.

65
00:04:21,248 --> 00:04:22,582
-But I got killed instead.

66
00:04:22,615 --> 00:04:24,682
-You mean you didn't beat it?

67
00:04:24,715 --> 00:04:25,482
-Really?

68
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:27,315
-Hey there, big brother!

69
00:04:27,348 --> 00:04:28,615
-Oh, hi Mahiro.

70
00:04:28,648 --> 00:04:31,615
-Oh yeah. she's a freshman,
starting today isn't she?

71
00:04:31,648 --> 00:04:33,115
-Congratulations, Mahiro.

72
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:34,348
-The uniform really suits you.

73
00:04:34,382 --> 00:04:35,148
-Really?

74
00:04:35,182 --> 00:04:36,948
I'm glad to hear that.

75
00:04:36,982 --> 00:04:39,248
To be honest, the reason I
actually came to this school

76
00:04:39,282 --> 00:04:41,915
is because I love
this uniform so much.

77
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,448
-Hey, so do I. As
a matter of fact,

78
00:04:43,482 --> 00:04:45,748
the only reason I came to
this school is because I love

79
00:04:45,782 --> 00:04:46,848
the girls' unifo--

80
00:04:46,882 --> 00:04:48,115
-Enough fooling around.

81
00:04:48,148 --> 00:04:49,515
Let's go.

00:04:49,548 --> 00:04:51,982
[excited chatter]

83
00:04:55,348 --> 00:04:57,815
-Uh, so my big brother
likes this uniform too?

84
00:04:57,848 --> 00:04:59,915
-Kazuki, you're
confusing your sister.

85
00:04:59,948 --> 00:05:01,182
MITA: Hey, you over there.

86
00:05:01,215 --> 00:05:04,548
Why aren't you caring your
school designated bag?

87
00:05:04,582 --> 00:05:05,848
-Um, I'm sorry.

88
00:05:05,882 --> 00:05:07,615
I sort of couldn't find it
when I got up this morning.

89
00:05:07,648 --> 00:05:09,215
-So, you lost it.

90
00:05:09,248 --> 00:05:11,148
Where were you after
school yesterday?

91
00:05:11,182 --> 00:05:12,915
-Well, uh, let me think.

92
00:05:12,948 --> 00:05:14,315
Uh.

93
00:05:14,348 --> 00:05:15,348
-Hm.

94
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:17,382
Well, I'll make an
exception this time,

95
00:05:17,415 --> 00:05:20,815
Kazuki Muto, Class
2B, but I'll need

96
00:05:20,848 --> 00:05:23,848
you to report to the teachers'
room during lunch break.

97
00:05:23,882 --> 00:05:25,148
-But what for?

98
00:05:25,182 --> 00:05:27,182
-Back talk will
not be tolerated.

99
00:05:27,215 --> 00:05:29,115
Understood?

100
00:05:29,148 --> 00:05:30,115
-Yes sir, I understand.

101
00:05:35,182 --> 00:05:36,615
MITA (VOICEOVER): I found you.

102
00:05:40,182 --> 00:05:42,815
OKAKURA: Mita's sure been
acting strange lately.

103
00:05:42,848 --> 00:05:44,282
-What do you mean, lately?

104
00:05:44,315 --> 00:05:46,182
I always thought he was
the weirdest teacher

105
00:05:46,215 --> 00:05:48,048
in the entire school
to begin with.

106
00:05:48,082 --> 00:05:49,148
-Thanks for waiting, guys.

107
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,548
-Hey, Kazuki.

108
00:05:50,582 --> 00:05:52,515
So what did Mita have to say?

109
00:05:52,548 --> 00:05:54,782
-You're never gonna
believe what he said.

110
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:57,415
TOGETHER: Pull out the weeds
in the school's back court?

111
00:05:57,448 --> 00:05:58,682
-That's just plain weird.

112
00:05:58,715 --> 00:05:59,982
What's up with that, huh?

113
00:06:00,015 --> 00:06:02,248
-Yeah, why would he ask you
to do something like that

114
00:06:02,282 --> 00:06:03,415
all by yourself?

115
00:06:03,448 --> 00:06:05,315
-More importantly, why
didn't you just say no?

116
00:06:05,348 --> 00:06:08,915
-Well, I did, but then he said
he would make Mahiro do it,

117
00:06:08,948 --> 00:06:09,948
so I had no choice.

118
00:06:09,982 --> 00:06:10,482
MAHIRO: What?

119
00:06:10,515 --> 00:06:11,048
No way.

120
00:06:11,082 --> 00:06:12,148
That's terrible.

121
00:06:12,182 --> 00:06:13,648
I'm going to protest.

122
00:06:13,682 --> 00:06:14,915
-Mahiro, wait.

123
00:06:14,948 --> 00:06:16,648
You can drink this.

124
00:06:16,682 --> 00:06:20,115
-Can I really?

125
00:06:20,148 --> 00:06:21,982
-Pulling weeds and
green juice are

126
00:06:22,015 --> 00:06:24,415
both to celebrate my
little sister's admission

127
00:06:24,448 --> 00:06:25,548
to this school.

128
00:06:25,582 --> 00:06:27,115
DAIHAMA: She's
really drinking that.

129
00:06:27,148 --> 00:06:30,015
OKAKAURA: They're
definitely related.

130
00:06:30,048 --> 00:06:31,748
-So, do you want us
to give you a hand?

131
00:06:31,782 --> 00:06:32,448
-Yeah.

132
00:06:32,482 --> 00:06:34,082
I wanna help you too.

133
00:06:34,115 --> 00:06:35,248
-No, it's cool.

134
00:06:35,282 --> 00:06:38,048
I'm sure I can manage
pulling weeds on my own.

135
00:06:38,082 --> 00:06:39,648
But I'll probably
be late, so please

136
00:06:39,682 --> 00:06:42,282
be sure to save me some dinner
for when I get home, all right?

137
00:06:42,315 --> 00:06:44,215
-OK, I'll do that!

138
00:06:44,248 --> 00:06:45,715
[bell chiming]

139
00:06:45,748 --> 00:06:46,582
-First bell.

140
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:47,382
come on.

141
00:06:47,415 --> 00:06:49,782
I guess we should get going.

142
00:06:49,815 --> 00:06:50,648
[phone beeping]

143
00:06:50,682 --> 00:06:51,515
-Huh?

144
00:06:51,548 --> 00:06:52,682
A text message?

145
00:06:52,715 --> 00:06:53,582
Wonder who it's from.

146
00:06:58,115 --> 00:06:59,482
What is this supposed to mean?

147
00:07:06,648 --> 00:07:08,515
-Such a peaceful town.

148
00:07:08,548 --> 00:07:16,482
But I'm sure they're
lurking somewhere out there,

149
00:07:16,515 --> 00:07:17,982
-Whew!

150
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,415
I'm finally finished.

151
00:07:25,048 --> 00:07:26,848
Man.

152
00:07:26,882 --> 00:07:28,582
The school sure is
creepy at night.

153
00:07:33,582 --> 00:07:37,448
The haunted factory, up
over in the back hills.

154
00:07:40,248 --> 00:07:42,515
Things sure have been
weird here since yesterday.

155
00:07:42,548 --> 00:07:44,548
I should just check
out and go home.

156
00:07:44,582 --> 00:07:46,248
MITA: Where do you
think you're going?

157
00:07:46,282 --> 00:07:47,248
OKAKURA: Hey, where you going?

158
00:07:47,282 --> 00:07:48,315
-Oh, hi there.

159
00:07:48,348 --> 00:07:50,615
Well, I'm going to
pick up my big brother.

160
00:07:50,648 --> 00:07:52,182
-What a nice sister you are.

161
00:07:52,215 --> 00:07:53,715
-I was thinking I'd
offer to help him,

162
00:07:53,748 --> 00:07:55,982
if he hasn't finished
with all those weeds.

163
00:07:56,015 --> 00:07:58,782
-Have you finished with
the work I asked you to do.

164
00:07:58,815 --> 00:07:59,748
-More or less.

165
00:07:59,782 --> 00:08:01,215
-More or less, huh?

166
00:08:01,248 --> 00:08:05,048
Well, that really
doesn't matter.

167
00:08:05,082 --> 00:08:06,048
-That's my bag.

168
00:08:06,082 --> 00:08:07,082
Where'd you find it?

169
00:08:07,115 --> 00:08:10,448
-The abandoned factory
on the back hill.

170
00:08:10,482 --> 00:08:13,415
It was left behind
last night by someone

171
00:08:13,448 --> 00:08:17,182
who interrupted my dinner.

172
00:08:17,215 --> 00:08:20,048
Meaning you.

173
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:21,648
KAZUKI (VOICEOVER):
What's going on?

174
00:08:21,682 --> 00:08:23,115
-How can you be alive?

175
00:08:23,148 --> 00:08:27,648
I was sure I killed you when I
skewered your heart last night.

176
00:08:27,682 --> 00:08:29,548
KAZUKI (VOICEOVER): This
must be a dream too.

177
00:08:29,582 --> 00:08:33,015
If not, I couldn't
be alive right now.

178
00:08:33,048 --> 00:08:34,382
-Doesn't matter.

179
00:08:34,415 --> 00:08:38,482
If you survived that, then this
time I'll kill you for good!

180
00:08:46,882 --> 00:08:50,315
-If it's not a dream, and last
night wasn't a dream, then--

181
00:08:50,348 --> 00:08:52,282
[phone ringing]

182
00:08:52,315 --> 00:08:53,782
-Who's this?

183
00:08:53,815 --> 00:08:55,748
-I'll be there in three minutes.

184
00:08:55,782 --> 00:08:57,248
Just hang on until then.

185
00:08:57,282 --> 00:08:58,748
KAZUKI (ON PHONE):
What's happening?

186
00:08:58,782 --> 00:08:59,715
What is that thing?

187
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:00,982
And who are you anyway?

188
00:09:01,015 --> 00:09:02,682
What exactly is going on here?

189
00:09:07,882 --> 00:09:09,782
WOMAN (ON PHONE): It's
not easy to talk and run

190
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:12,182
at the same time, so I'll
give you the quick version.

191
00:09:12,215 --> 00:09:13,415
-Yes, please do.

192
00:09:13,448 --> 00:09:15,048
WOMAN (ON PHONE): That thing
is called a Homunculus.

193
00:09:15,082 --> 00:09:18,148
It's a creature that hides in
people, transforms into people,

194
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:18,915
and eats people.

195
00:09:18,948 --> 00:09:20,348
-It eats people?

196
00:09:20,382 --> 00:09:21,315
-Yes.

197
00:09:21,348 --> 00:09:23,715
I followed that
thing to this town,

198
00:09:23,748 --> 00:09:25,182
and then got you involved.

199
00:09:25,215 --> 00:09:26,015
-I'm involved?

200
00:09:26,048 --> 00:09:27,089
What do you mean I'm involved?

201
00:09:27,089 --> 00:09:27,889
How?

202
00:09:27,889 --> 00:09:28,789
WOMAN (ON PHONE):
I see you still

203
00:09:28,822 --> 00:09:30,622
haven't remembered
everything, huh?

204
00:09:30,655 --> 00:09:32,189
-Well, what am I
supposed to remember?

205
00:09:32,222 --> 00:09:33,222
WOMAN (ON PHONE): Anyway.

206
00:09:33,255 --> 00:09:34,322
Don't stop.

207
00:09:34,355 --> 00:09:35,489
Keep running.

208
00:09:35,522 --> 00:09:36,989
In order to hide
their existence,

209
00:09:37,022 --> 00:09:39,122
they never let a witness live.

210
00:09:39,155 --> 00:09:41,055
They'll chase you down forever.

211
00:09:41,089 --> 00:09:44,122
Once you get involved,
there is no way out.

212
00:09:47,555 --> 00:09:49,122
-Whoa, you scared me!

213
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:51,189
What's with that
look on your face?

214
00:09:51,222 --> 00:09:52,022
-Mahiro.

215
00:09:52,055 --> 00:09:53,422
What are you doing here?

216
00:09:53,455 --> 00:09:55,722
-Well, you were running late,
so I came to check up on you.

217
00:09:55,755 --> 00:09:56,789
KAZUKI (VOICEOVER): Oh no.

218
00:09:56,822 --> 00:09:59,555
I got her involved.

219
00:09:59,589 --> 00:10:00,589
-Run, Mahiro!

220
00:10:00,622 --> 00:10:01,955
I'll figure out a
way to hold him off.

221
00:10:01,989 --> 00:10:05,422
-What are you talking about
What's the matter, big brother?

222
00:10:05,455 --> 00:10:06,355
Big brother!

223
00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:07,722
-Get out of here, now!

224
00:10:18,722 --> 00:10:24,022
-It's a bit difficult to move in
this form on an empty stomach.

225
00:10:24,055 --> 00:10:25,989
But this should
make up for the meal

226
00:10:26,022 --> 00:10:30,955
that I missed out on
eating last night.

227
00:10:30,989 --> 00:10:31,922
-Give her back!

228
00:10:31,955 --> 00:10:32,922
Give her back!

229
00:10:32,955 --> 00:10:34,422
She's got nothing
to do with this.

230
00:10:34,455 --> 00:10:35,122
Give her back!

231
00:10:35,155 --> 00:10:35,689
Give her back!

232
00:10:35,722 --> 00:10:36,689
Give her back!

233
00:10:36,722 --> 00:10:38,422
-No need to get carried away.

234
00:10:41,255 --> 00:10:45,489
This body was created
by alchemy and will not

235
00:10:45,522 --> 00:10:48,422
relent to anything but
the power of alchemy.

236
00:10:48,455 --> 00:10:50,722
-What do you mean,
the power of alchemy?

237
00:10:58,222 --> 00:11:00,089
WOMAN: Can you hear me?

238
00:11:00,122 --> 00:11:02,222
The reason you
died is because you

239
00:11:02,255 --> 00:11:05,055
got involved without being
aware of the consequences

240
00:11:05,089 --> 00:11:05,822
of your actions.

241
00:11:10,589 --> 00:11:11,922
However.

242
00:11:11,955 --> 00:11:14,622
You attempted to save
my life last night.

243
00:11:14,655 --> 00:11:18,822
Your actions have
piqued my interest.

244
00:11:18,855 --> 00:11:21,122
This is a Kakugane.

245
00:11:21,155 --> 00:11:23,555
It is a paranormal alloy
forged by concentrating

246
00:11:23,589 --> 00:11:26,755
the essence of alchemy.

247
00:11:26,789 --> 00:11:30,322
It functions in response to the
deepest part of the human mind.

248
00:11:30,355 --> 00:11:31,555
The human instinct.

249
00:11:31,589 --> 00:11:33,722
It will awaken the
survival instinct

250
00:11:33,755 --> 00:11:35,489
as a substitute for the heart.

251
00:11:38,455 --> 00:11:43,255
You will regain the
power to live again.

252
00:11:43,289 --> 00:11:48,155
And at the same time,
you'll obtain another power.

253
00:11:48,189 --> 00:11:50,855
That is the power to fight.

254
00:11:50,889 --> 00:11:52,722
Activated by human
instinct, it will give you

255
00:11:52,755 --> 00:11:54,789
the strength you
need to do battle.

256
00:11:54,822 --> 00:11:57,822
That is the true
power of the Kakugane.

257
00:11:57,855 --> 00:12:00,822
-It looks like you don't
know when to quit, do you?

258
00:12:00,855 --> 00:12:03,622
You already should've
died last night.

259
00:12:03,655 --> 00:12:05,922
-You will give back Mahiro.

260
00:12:05,955 --> 00:12:07,522
-Keep dreaming.

261
00:12:07,555 --> 00:12:11,622
You'll be eaten up and
joining your little sister.

262
00:12:11,655 --> 00:12:12,155
-You monster!

263
00:12:20,689 --> 00:12:21,622
-You fool!

264
00:12:21,655 --> 00:12:25,055
You still don't get it, do you?

265
00:12:25,089 --> 00:12:25,689
Huh?

266
00:12:25,722 --> 00:12:27,955
Get out of my way.

267
00:12:27,989 --> 00:12:29,522
-Buso Renkin.

268
00:12:29,555 --> 00:12:30,155
Valkyrie Skirt!

269
00:12:38,589 --> 00:12:39,555
-You again.

270
00:12:53,892 --> 00:12:54,859
It's you!

271
00:12:54,892 --> 00:12:56,359
You're the one from last night.

272
00:13:04,892 --> 00:13:07,859
Death scythe Buso Renkin!

273
00:13:07,892 --> 00:13:09,792
So that can only mean one thing!

274
00:13:12,826 --> 00:13:14,292
You're an Alchemist Warrior!

275
00:13:20,259 --> 00:13:20,792
-Mahiro!

276
00:13:27,359 --> 00:13:28,392
I remember.

277
00:13:28,426 --> 00:13:30,092
Last night on the
way home from school,

278
00:13:30,126 --> 00:13:32,926
I looked up and saw a light
on in the haunted factory,

279
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,792
and when I went there, you
were about to be eaten by Mita.

280
00:13:35,826 --> 00:13:36,792
-No.

281
00:13:36,826 --> 00:13:38,392
I just pretended
to be defenseless

282
00:13:38,426 --> 00:13:40,059
so I could lure him out.

283
00:13:40,092 --> 00:13:40,726
-You're kidding?

284
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:41,759
-No, it's true.

285
00:13:41,792 --> 00:13:44,092
-So I died because of
a misunderstanding?

286
00:13:44,126 --> 00:13:47,426
That is just so lame!

287
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:49,826
Mahiro, are you OK?

288
00:13:49,859 --> 00:13:52,226
-She's probably doing
much better than you are.

289
00:13:52,259 --> 00:13:54,559
There's really nothing
wrong with her.

290
00:13:54,592 --> 00:13:55,759
-Thank goodness.

291
00:13:55,792 --> 00:13:57,759
I feel a lot better
now that I know that.

292
00:13:57,792 --> 00:13:59,592
-You really are strange.

293
00:13:59,626 --> 00:14:01,926
Both last night
and just now, you

294
00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:04,426
told me you were full
of fear and pain,

295
00:14:04,459 --> 00:14:05,759
yet you appear courageous.

296
00:14:10,592 --> 00:14:13,626
Well, whichever it
is, you certainly

297
00:14:13,659 --> 00:14:14,759
have piqued my interest.

298
00:14:18,359 --> 00:14:19,192
KAZUKI: Here it is.

299
00:14:19,226 --> 00:14:21,359
It really is in the dictionary.

300
00:14:21,392 --> 00:14:22,759
-Alchemy.

301
00:14:22,792 --> 00:14:26,192
An integrated science technology
which spread all across Europe

302
00:14:26,226 --> 00:14:28,392
before the time
of the modern age.

303
00:14:28,426 --> 00:14:31,359
The original goal was
to change lead to gold,

304
00:14:31,392 --> 00:14:34,026
or to create an elixir
for eternal life.

305
00:14:34,059 --> 00:14:35,692
These attempts were
not successful,

306
00:14:35,726 --> 00:14:38,459
but would become the
foundation for modern science.

307
00:14:38,492 --> 00:14:39,459
What's the matter?

308
00:14:39,492 --> 00:14:40,992
You've got a weird
look on your face.

309
00:14:41,026 --> 00:14:42,359
-It's-- It's nothing.

310
00:14:42,392 --> 00:14:43,859
I was born this way.

311
00:14:43,892 --> 00:14:44,892
-Oh really?

312
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:46,426
I'm very sorry to hear that.

313
00:14:46,459 --> 00:14:46,926
-Huh?

314
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:47,559
Wait.

315
00:14:47,592 --> 00:14:48,592
Hold on a minute.

316
00:14:48,626 --> 00:14:50,692
You just said that
it wasn't successful?

317
00:14:50,726 --> 00:14:53,726
-As far as anyone who
reads this is concerned.

318
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:56,192
Alchemy did have two
paranormal successes

319
00:14:56,226 --> 00:14:59,392
that were incomprehensible
to normal people.

320
00:14:59,426 --> 00:15:02,359
They were Homunculi
and Buso Renkin.

321
00:15:02,392 --> 00:15:04,626
-Homunculi and Buso Renkin?

322
00:15:04,659 --> 00:15:06,026
What do you mean?

323
00:15:06,059 --> 00:15:09,359
-Homunculi are the byproducts
of research on artificial life.

324
00:15:09,392 --> 00:15:13,326
Buso Renkin is the result of
tactical munitions development.

325
00:15:13,359 --> 00:15:16,426
However, they were both
just too dangerous.

326
00:15:16,459 --> 00:15:19,192
In the end, they were hidden
from the general public

327
00:15:19,226 --> 00:15:20,792
and were left in
the hands of those

328
00:15:20,826 --> 00:15:23,792
who truly understood
the powers of alchemy.

329
00:15:23,826 --> 00:15:27,259
Unfortunately, many have slipped
through the hands of those

330
00:15:27,292 --> 00:15:29,859
responsible and are scattered
throughout the world,

331
00:15:29,892 --> 00:15:32,959
and now they prey upon humans
under the dark of night.

332
00:15:32,992 --> 00:15:34,426
-The haunted factory.

333
00:15:34,459 --> 00:15:36,392
It's a hideout
for the Homunculi.

334
00:15:36,426 --> 00:15:38,892
I must go defeat
the rest of them.

335
00:15:38,926 --> 00:15:40,426
Buso Renkin.

336
00:15:40,459 --> 00:15:41,592
-I wanna go too!

337
00:15:41,626 --> 00:15:43,426
If there's anything I
can do to help, then--

338
00:15:47,259 --> 00:15:48,959
-Just stay away.

339
00:15:48,992 --> 00:15:50,692
The reason I gave
you the Kakugane

340
00:15:50,726 --> 00:15:52,759
was not because I
wanted you to fight,

341
00:15:52,792 --> 00:15:55,792
but because I felt that your
life was a life worth saving.

342
00:15:55,826 --> 00:15:58,026
I told you about the
Homunculi and Buso Renkin

343
00:15:58,059 --> 00:16:00,759
so you could properly grasp
the situation and deal

344
00:16:00,792 --> 00:16:03,126
with any circumstances
you encounter.

345
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:06,826
Battle is my mission alone.

346
00:16:06,859 --> 00:16:08,892
-But still, I--

347
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:11,659
-Just stay away.

348
00:16:11,692 --> 00:16:13,259
What about your sister?

349
00:16:13,292 --> 00:16:15,359
I want you to think about that.

350
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:17,959
When she wakes up from
her terrifying nightmare,

351
00:16:17,992 --> 00:16:19,792
how would she feel
if she found herself

352
00:16:19,826 --> 00:16:22,059
alone in the health
office at night?

353
00:16:22,092 --> 00:16:24,859
Let me try to make this as
clear as possible for you.

354
00:16:24,892 --> 00:16:27,792
What you decide now will
determine your future.

355
00:16:27,826 --> 00:16:31,726
Return to the world you know
or enter a world of battle.

356
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,292
I don't need to tell
you which world it

357
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:37,026
is you belong to, right?

358
00:16:37,059 --> 00:16:39,359
I've no intention of
involving you any further.

359
00:16:42,026 --> 00:16:43,392
Just stay away.

360
00:16:43,426 --> 00:16:44,492
You must not come.

361
00:16:47,859 --> 00:16:50,192
You should just go
home, with your sister.

362
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:00,426
-I'm not sure why,
but I feel like I've

363
00:17:00,459 --> 00:17:02,992
been through a very
scary experience.

364
00:17:03,026 --> 00:17:05,559
-What can I do to wake her up?

365
00:17:05,592 --> 00:17:07,859
She probably just needs some
medicine to wake her up.

366
00:17:07,892 --> 00:17:08,726
Maybe this'll work.

367
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:09,526
Or this.

368
00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:10,292
-Stop it!

369
00:17:10,326 --> 00:17:11,192
You're scaring me!

370
00:17:11,226 --> 00:17:12,326
Oh, that's right.

371
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:16,659
I fell in the schoolyard
and I bumped my head.

372
00:17:16,692 --> 00:17:17,859
It's so cold in here.

373
00:17:17,892 --> 00:17:19,692
-Well, it's because you're
not wearing a jacket.

374
00:17:19,726 --> 00:17:21,126
Here you go.

375
00:17:21,159 --> 00:17:21,826
-Thanks, brother.

376
00:17:25,026 --> 00:17:26,526
-So, Mahiro.

377
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,392
How tall are you these days?

378
00:17:28,426 --> 00:17:31,359
-Um, well, I guess
I'm about 5 foot 3.

379
00:17:31,392 --> 00:17:32,359
-Really?

380
00:17:32,392 --> 00:17:33,592
I see.

381
00:17:33,626 --> 00:17:35,259
KAZUKI (VOICEOVER): Her
shoulders sure seemed small.

382
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:40,259
-Thanks again, Kazuki.

383
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:41,359
I'm better now.

384
00:17:41,392 --> 00:17:44,159
Let's hurry back
to the dorm, OK?

385
00:17:44,192 --> 00:17:46,359
Big brother?

386
00:17:46,392 --> 00:17:47,126
-All right.

387
00:17:47,159 --> 00:17:48,492
Are you ready to go, then?

388
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:49,159
-Ah huh.

389
00:17:49,192 --> 00:17:50,426
-Let's run, Mahiro.

390
00:17:50,459 --> 00:17:51,059
Quick, come on!

391
00:17:51,092 --> 00:17:52,059
-No!

392
00:17:52,092 --> 00:17:53,526
But why?

393
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:54,026
Why?

394
00:18:00,526 --> 00:18:02,492
-I'll splatter your guts!

395
00:18:09,459 --> 00:18:10,392
-It's a woman!

396
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:13,892
-Think again.

397
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,126
It looks like you're the prey.

398
00:18:20,092 --> 00:18:22,559
WOMAN (VOICEOVER):
There's too many of them.

399
00:18:22,592 --> 00:18:24,259
This is more than
just a simple hideout.

400
00:18:28,292 --> 00:18:32,759
-This must be the woman Mita
talked about last night.

401
00:18:32,792 --> 00:18:35,459
-That's the last one.

402
00:18:35,492 --> 00:18:36,626
-I see.

403
00:18:36,659 --> 00:18:38,826
So you're The alchemist Warrior.

404
00:18:38,859 --> 00:18:42,259
The Buso Renkin expert who's
been chosen from among those

405
00:18:42,292 --> 00:18:44,459
who truly understand alchemy.

406
00:18:44,492 --> 00:18:46,926
But do you really think you
can just much march in here

407
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:47,759
and win by yourself?

408
00:18:47,792 --> 00:18:50,026
-I always fight alone.

409
00:18:50,059 --> 00:18:52,459
Come on.

410
00:18:52,492 --> 00:18:55,226
-This should be fun!

411
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:57,692
-I've got her, Mr. Saruwatari!

412
00:18:57,726 --> 00:18:58,926
-He hid inside a corpse!

413
00:18:58,959 --> 00:19:01,926
-It's tough by yourself,
isn't it, Alchemist Warrior?

414
00:19:01,959 --> 00:19:04,359
-Let me go!

415
00:19:04,392 --> 00:19:05,826
Filthy!

416
00:19:05,859 --> 00:19:07,759
[laughter]

417
00:19:07,792 --> 00:19:09,192
[shout]

418
00:19:09,226 --> 00:19:09,692
-Huh?

419
00:19:12,959 --> 00:19:14,559
TOKIKO (VOICEOVER):
It is that instinct

420
00:19:14,592 --> 00:19:17,526
that actives it and gives
you the strength to fight.

421
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:19,892
That is the true
power of the Kakugane.

422
00:19:22,792 --> 00:19:25,326
It transforms their
dormant fighting strength

423
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:27,792
into a weapon like no other.

424
00:19:27,826 --> 00:19:32,092
Control, determination,
and roar!

425
00:19:32,126 --> 00:19:33,992
It's called--

426
00:19:34,026 --> 00:19:36,892
-Buso Renkin!

427
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:37,859
-I'm back.

428
00:19:40,759 --> 00:19:41,426
-Hi.

429
00:19:41,459 --> 00:19:42,359
Welcome back, Mahiro.

430
00:19:42,392 --> 00:19:44,792
-Hey, so where' Kazuki?

431
00:19:44,826 --> 00:19:47,492
-We were together until
we got to the front door.

432
00:19:47,526 --> 00:19:49,692
But then he said he had
something to take care of,

433
00:19:49,726 --> 00:19:50,426
and left.

434
00:19:50,459 --> 00:19:51,892
-And this time of night?

435
00:19:51,926 --> 00:19:53,326
Shouldn't it wait until morning?

436
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,559
-Well, I asked him
that, too, but he

437
00:19:55,592 --> 00:19:58,126
said he absolutely
needed to go now.

438
00:20:01,059 --> 00:20:03,426
[shout]

439
00:20:06,792 --> 00:20:10,026
-What is this?

440
00:20:10,059 --> 00:20:11,726
You'll never be able
to beat my strength.

441
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:14,259
Do you have any idea
how strong I am?

442
00:20:14,292 --> 00:20:15,626
I didn't think so!

443
00:20:20,659 --> 00:20:22,159
-Pierce through, my Buso Renkin!

444
00:20:25,692 --> 00:20:27,626
-The cloth is
turning into energy!

445
00:20:31,659 --> 00:20:34,626
[scream]

446
00:20:34,659 --> 00:20:36,126
-It's so powerful.

447
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:53,692
What about your little sister?

448
00:20:53,726 --> 00:20:54,926
-Don't worry about her.

449
00:20:54,959 --> 00:20:57,159
She's safe and sound at home.

450
00:20:57,192 --> 00:20:59,492
I ran full speed for
30 minutes, but I still

451
00:20:59,526 --> 00:21:01,459
have lots of energy--

452
00:21:01,492 --> 00:21:03,259
-It doesn't look that way.

453
00:21:03,292 --> 00:21:04,392
Why did you come?

454
00:21:04,426 --> 00:21:06,459
I warned you not to come here.

455
00:21:06,492 --> 00:21:07,859
-I couldn't choose.

456
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:09,492
-What are you talking about?

457
00:21:09,526 --> 00:21:11,826
-Mahiro's important
to me, but I just

458
00:21:11,859 --> 00:21:13,492
couldn't leave you
here all by yourself.

459
00:21:18,692 --> 00:21:20,092
-Take a look
underneath your feet.

460
00:21:20,126 --> 00:21:22,992
-Huh?

461
00:21:23,026 --> 00:21:24,626
What-- what is this?

462
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:25,859
-I told you.

463
00:21:25,892 --> 00:21:28,059
This is how they do things.

464
00:21:28,092 --> 00:21:31,159
It seems this isn't
their normal hideout.

465
00:21:31,192 --> 00:21:33,059
The ones who were here
have been wiped out,

466
00:21:33,092 --> 00:21:34,926
but more of these
monsters are surely

467
00:21:34,959 --> 00:21:37,759
lurking somewhere in town.

468
00:21:37,792 --> 00:21:39,126
-I can't believe it.

469
00:21:39,159 --> 00:21:41,259
More monsters like that
are still out there?

470
00:21:41,292 --> 00:21:43,992
-The situation is worse
than I first thought.

471
00:21:44,026 --> 00:21:45,826
You should not get
involved any further.

472
00:21:45,859 --> 00:21:48,192
-That's all the more
reason I can't back out.

473
00:21:48,226 --> 00:21:50,359
If such things are still
lurking in our town,

474
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:53,326
Mahiro and the others
will be in danger.

475
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:55,692
I have the power to
fight that you gave me,

476
00:21:55,726 --> 00:21:57,259
and now I must use it.

477
00:22:02,992 --> 00:22:05,559
TOKIKO (VOICEOVER): He's acting
differently from last night.

478
00:22:05,592 --> 00:22:07,726
Even though he's
aware of the dangers,

479
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:09,292
he's still willing to fight.

480
00:22:14,526 --> 00:22:16,592
-Just so you know,
I was telling you

481
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:18,359
all of this for your own good.

482
00:22:18,392 --> 00:22:19,692
-I understand.

483
00:22:19,726 --> 00:22:22,026
But just so you know, there's
no way I can just stand by

484
00:22:22,059 --> 00:22:23,692
and simply do nothing about it.

485
00:22:23,726 --> 00:22:27,526
I'm going to help you get
rid of these monsters.

486
00:22:27,559 --> 00:22:29,092
TOKIKO (VOICEOVER): Kazuki Muto.

487
00:22:29,126 --> 00:22:33,592
This boy has the qualities of
a virtuous warrior within him.

488
00:22:33,626 --> 00:22:36,859
-Nothing I say to you is going
to change your mind, is it?

489
00:22:36,892 --> 00:22:37,559
-That's right.

490
00:22:37,592 --> 00:22:38,926
-OK.

491
00:22:38,959 --> 00:22:41,359
Got it.

492
00:22:41,392 --> 00:22:44,626
Then you will begin training
as a Warrior Apprentice.

493
00:22:44,659 --> 00:22:46,992
But I don't want you
dying on me ever again.

494
00:22:47,026 --> 00:22:49,526
From now on, you are to
follow my instructions.

495
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:50,459
Got it?

496
00:22:50,492 --> 00:22:51,692
-I got it.

497
00:22:51,726 --> 00:22:52,492
But you--

498
00:22:52,526 --> 00:22:54,392
-Now what?

499
00:22:54,426 --> 00:22:58,459
-You never told me
what your name is.

500
00:22:58,492 --> 00:22:59,659
-I'm sorry.

501
00:22:59,692 --> 00:23:02,492
I guess I forgot to tell you.

502
00:23:02,526 --> 00:23:03,792
Listen up.

503
00:23:03,826 --> 00:23:07,259
My name is Tokiko.

504
00:23:07,292 --> 00:23:08,526
Tokiko Tsumura.

505
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:09,159
-Tokiko Tsumura?

506
00:23:23,808 --> 00:23:28,241
[theme music]

507
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:58,030
TOKIKO: The boy who I've
given the Kakugane to.

508
00:24:58,063 --> 00:25:00,696
His Buso Renkin is powerful,
but he doesn't completely

509
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:01,896
understand.

510
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:05,263
Next time, The True
Form Homunculus.

511
00:25:05,296 --> 00:25:08,530
I'll splatter your guts!
