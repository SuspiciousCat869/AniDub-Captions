NARRATOR: The supernatural
alloy produced

2
00:00:14,533 --> 00:00:18,966
by gathering the essence
of alchemy is the Kakugane.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,900
This device activates upon a
person's fighting instinct,

4
00:00:22,933 --> 00:00:25,500
manifesting the
possessor's inner power

5
00:00:25,533 --> 00:00:30,166
into a tangible form, creating
a weapon like no other.

6
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,133
Its name, Buso Renkin.

00:02:10,822 --> 00:02:12,855
KAZUKI: Where are they?

10
00:02:12,888 --> 00:02:15,222
I really hope they're
both all right.

11
00:02:15,255 --> 00:02:16,188
What's that?

12
00:02:34,222 --> 00:02:36,088
Captain Bravo?

13
00:02:36,122 --> 00:02:38,722
-It's time to settle
our score, Kazuki Muto.

14
00:02:50,788 --> 00:02:53,522
KAZUKI: Hey, what are
you talking about, Bravo?

15
00:02:53,555 --> 00:02:54,822
I mean really, look at me.

16
00:02:54,855 --> 00:02:57,788
I think I look pretty
human right now.

17
00:02:57,822 --> 00:03:00,322
BRAVO: One doesn't become
like Victor at once.

18
00:03:00,355 --> 00:03:03,655
There are stages, and you
are still at stage one.

19
00:03:03,688 --> 00:03:06,755
If my calculations are
correct, your transformation

20
00:03:06,788 --> 00:03:09,222
will be complete
in about six weeks.

21
00:03:09,255 --> 00:03:12,088
By the end of the summer
you will be just like Victor

22
00:03:12,122 --> 00:03:15,188
a monster whose mere existence
brings death and destruction

23
00:03:15,222 --> 00:03:16,888
to all around it.

24
00:03:16,922 --> 00:03:19,522
Before that happens,
you must be disposed of.

25
00:03:19,555 --> 00:03:23,322
That is my new mission.

26
00:03:23,355 --> 00:03:25,222
-Bravo.

27
00:03:25,255 --> 00:03:27,322
-You were killed
by a Homunculus.

28
00:03:27,355 --> 00:03:29,522
The life that Warrior
Tokiko gave you

29
00:03:29,555 --> 00:03:31,788
should never have
been given to anyone.

30
00:03:31,822 --> 00:03:35,288
You must be killed once
again to set things right.

31
00:03:35,322 --> 00:03:36,788
-Bravo!

32
00:03:36,822 --> 00:03:38,322
-Kazuki Muto must
be re-exterminated.

33
00:03:47,722 --> 00:03:49,622
-Say it isn't so, Bravo.

34
00:03:53,088 --> 00:03:54,788
Please tell me you're
kidding, Bravo.

35
00:03:54,822 --> 00:03:57,755
Just say it.

36
00:03:57,788 --> 00:03:59,255
It's a lie!

37
00:03:59,288 --> 00:04:01,255
Lie, lie, lie, lie!

38
00:04:01,288 --> 00:04:03,822
You are lying!

39
00:04:03,855 --> 00:04:07,555
-Food good or for
evil, there is no shame

40
00:04:07,588 --> 00:04:11,388
in holding to your beliefs
until the very end.

41
00:04:11,422 --> 00:04:12,788
KAZUKI (VOICEOVER):
The same words

42
00:04:12,822 --> 00:04:15,188
he used when he recruited
me as a Warrior.

43
00:04:15,222 --> 00:04:18,188
-My mission is to save
as many people as I can.

44
00:04:18,222 --> 00:04:21,155
And to do that I'm even willing
to kill a fellow Warrior if I

45
00:04:21,188 --> 00:04:22,722
need to.

46
00:04:22,755 --> 00:04:25,688
I would even become evil itself.

47
00:04:25,722 --> 00:04:27,022
KAZUKI (VOICEOVER):
So it's true.

48
00:04:27,055 --> 00:04:32,722
The man standing before me
really is Captain Bravo.

49
00:04:32,755 --> 00:04:35,555
-Now, will you law down
your life willingly?

50
00:04:38,288 --> 00:04:38,755
Kazuki.

51
00:04:42,722 --> 00:04:45,755
-I understand.

52
00:04:45,788 --> 00:04:46,888
But not now!

53
00:04:46,922 --> 00:04:47,922
I won't give up just yet.

54
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:49,022
I can't.

55
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:50,722
Don't you see that those
are the same words that

56
00:04:50,755 --> 00:04:52,855
encouraged me to become
an Alchemist Warrior?

57
00:04:52,888 --> 00:04:55,588
Believing in my own
convictions, like you?

58
00:04:55,622 --> 00:04:57,888
If six weeks is all I have
left as a human being,

59
00:04:57,922 --> 00:05:02,422
then I'm going to pursue my
convictions to the very end!

60
00:05:02,455 --> 00:05:02,922
Buso Renkin!

61
00:05:11,855 --> 00:05:14,288
-Let's end this now.

62
00:05:14,322 --> 00:05:15,122
-Yes.

63
00:05:15,155 --> 00:05:16,522
I'll triumph and end it here.

TOKIKO (VOICEOVER):
Where are you, Kazuki?

00:06:21,222 --> 00:06:24,155
Where are you?

00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:30,988
-Tokiko!

00:06:31,022 --> 00:06:33,822
-I've got to search for Kazuki.

71
00:06:33,855 --> 00:06:34,588
I'm concerned.

72
00:06:34,622 --> 00:06:35,622
Where could he be?

73
00:06:35,655 --> 00:06:36,688
He couldn't have gone far.

74
00:06:40,822 --> 00:06:41,288
Huh?

75
00:06:45,222 --> 00:06:47,155
-Come on.

76
00:06:47,188 --> 00:06:47,922

It's really not a big deal.

-By the sound of things,
they should be close.

-Yeah, they must be.

I thought he was battling
Warrior Chief Hiwatari.

-After them!

-I didn't expect his
opponent to be Captain Bravo.

104
00:10:37,788 --> 00:10:41,022
-Actually, he may stand a
better chance against Bravo

105
00:10:41,055 --> 00:10:42,322
than Hiwatari.

106
00:10:42,355 --> 00:10:45,188
That is, of course, if
we can catch up to them.

107
00:10:45,222 --> 00:10:46,788
-Yeah, but do you
really think there's

108
00:10:46,822 --> 00:10:49,188
a way to defeat Captain Bravo?

109
00:10:49,222 --> 00:10:49,688
-There is.

110
00:11:25,522 --> 00:11:28,888
KAZUKI (VOICEOVER): I must
breach his Silver Skin.

111
00:11:28,922 --> 00:11:29,855
-And I will.

112
00:11:58,488 --> 00:12:01,188
-Very impressive strategy.

113
00:12:01,222 --> 00:12:04,622
And yet, it's been in vain.

114
00:12:21,872 --> 00:12:24,706
Very impressive strategy.

115
00:12:24,739 --> 00:12:27,706
And yet, it's been in vain.

BRAVO: You grow stronger
the more you fight.

00:12:55,439 --> 00:12:59,239
That is why I have to
finish you here and now.

119
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:03,206
KAZUKI (VOICEOVER):
Silver Skin Reverse.

KAZUKI: Gota!

-Just as you suspected, Tokiko.

123
00:13:27,272 --> 00:13:30,339
Even the Silver Skin can't
be precisely controlled

124
00:13:30,372 --> 00:13:32,439
from a distance.

125
00:13:32,472 --> 00:13:34,039
-If you could control
it, you wouldn't

126
00:13:34,072 --> 00:13:35,539
need to wear it at all.

127
00:13:35,572 --> 00:13:37,806
You'd just simply manipulate
it as an automaton

128
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,972
and have it fight for you.

129
00:13:40,006 --> 00:13:43,706
The most you can do is
activate it and launch it.

130
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:46,606
Isn't that correct?

131
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,139
-That means if you force
your way into it the way

132
00:13:49,172 --> 00:13:51,472
I just did right
now, then the Silver

133
00:13:51,506 --> 00:13:54,272
Skin won't reach its target.

134
00:13:54,306 --> 00:13:55,906
The same thing would
happen even if you

135
00:13:55,939 --> 00:13:57,539
launched the one you're wearing.

136
00:13:57,572 --> 00:14:01,206
My Motor Gears are faster
than your Silver Skin.

137
00:14:01,239 --> 00:14:04,072
-Silver Skin Reverse
will no longer

138
00:14:04,106 --> 00:14:07,472
be effective in this battle.

139
00:14:07,506 --> 00:14:10,172
-Warrior Tokiko,
Warrior Gota, have

140
00:14:10,206 --> 00:14:12,739
you no regrets about the
actions you have chosen?

141
00:14:12,772 --> 00:14:14,672
-None.

142
00:14:14,706 --> 00:14:16,139
-I see.

143
00:14:16,172 --> 00:14:18,439
Then both of you step aside.

144
00:14:18,472 --> 00:14:21,239
Once this battle is
over, I will do my best

145
00:14:21,272 --> 00:14:23,706
to see that you return
to the Alchemist Army

146
00:14:23,739 --> 00:14:25,572
-I'm not interested
in going back.

147
00:14:25,606 --> 00:14:27,039
Not without Kazuki.

148
00:14:27,072 --> 00:14:28,406
Please listen.

149
00:14:28,439 --> 00:14:30,439
We are not acting
on blind faith.

150
00:14:30,472 --> 00:14:32,806
We do have leads.

151
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:34,772
-Newton Apple Academy for Girls.

152
00:14:34,806 --> 00:14:37,872
-If you know about it, then
give us a little bit more time.

153
00:14:37,906 --> 00:14:39,139
Give Kazuki a chance.

154
00:14:39,172 --> 00:14:41,906
-Even if your actions are
not based on blind faith,

155
00:14:41,939 --> 00:14:43,972
they amount to just a
faint glimmer in the dark.

156
00:14:44,006 --> 00:14:47,572
I cannot risk so many people's
lives on such a tiny ray

157
00:14:47,606 --> 00:14:48,706
of hope.

158
00:14:48,739 --> 00:14:50,706
-Warrior Chief!

159
00:14:50,739 --> 00:14:55,106
-For 100 years, The Alchemist
Army has been pursuing Victor.

160
00:14:55,139 --> 00:14:57,072
My presence here
represents the conclusion

161
00:14:57,106 --> 00:14:58,339
of those hundred years.

162
00:14:58,372 --> 00:15:00,639
There is no other
end but extermination

163
00:15:00,672 --> 00:15:02,539
for those who have
exchanged their lives

164
00:15:02,572 --> 00:15:05,106
for the black Kakugane.

165

-The Silver Skin can
be torn by an impact

00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:09,106
greater than its strength.

167
00:15:09,139 --> 00:15:11,939
That's a fact.

168
00:15:11,972 --> 00:15:15,139
But its regenerative power
far exceeds the speed

169
00:15:15,172 --> 00:15:17,706
of its destruction, and can
prevent a followup attack.

170
00:15:20,339 --> 00:15:23,006
In that case, if the
attack is executed

171
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:25,706
at a speed that will exceed
the regenerative force--

172
00:15:25,739 --> 00:15:28,806
use this, Kazuki, and
turn into a Victor.

173
00:15:28,839 --> 00:15:31,672
Double Buso Renkin,
plus Victor power.

174
00:15:31,706 --> 00:15:35,806
This is the only way to break
through the Silver Skin.

175
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,572
-No.

176
00:15:38,606 --> 00:15:42,106
If I do that, the energy
drain will engage.

177
00:15:42,139 --> 00:15:44,406
It won't be like that time
at Ginsei Academy, where

178
00:15:44,439 --> 00:15:46,472
there were so many
people around.

179
00:15:46,506 --> 00:15:47,839
-Kazuki--

180
00:15:47,872 --> 00:15:50,006
-I have no doubt that this
could be very harmful to

181
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:51,572
and Gota, Tokiko.

182
00:15:51,606 --> 00:15:53,572
It could threaten
both your lives.

183
00:15:53,606 --> 00:15:54,806
-What are you saying?

184
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:56,539
You're giving up
a chance to win?

185
00:15:56,572 --> 00:15:57,672
Don't worry about me.

186
00:15:57,706 --> 00:15:59,339
I made my decision.

187
00:15:59,372 --> 00:16:04,472
-If that's what Tokiko wants,
then I don't mind, either.

188
00:16:04,506 --> 00:16:07,972
-I'm sorry, but I
don't want that.

189
00:16:08,006 --> 00:16:09,639
I want to protect people.

190
00:16:09,672 --> 00:16:11,006
All people.

191
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:14,906
That's why I became an Alchemist
Warrior in the first place.

192
00:16:14,939 --> 00:16:17,572
So even if I have
to lose this battle,

193
00:16:17,606 --> 00:16:21,039
at least I didn't resort
to harming my friends.

194
00:16:21,072 --> 00:16:22,039
That's my belief.

195
00:16:24,972 --> 00:16:28,039
-Warrior Chief, do you
still intend to kill Kazuki?

196
00:16:28,072 --> 00:16:30,472
Even after you crushed
that single ray of hope,

197
00:16:30,506 --> 00:16:33,039
do you mean to tell me that
you would still kill him?

198
00:16:33,072 --> 00:16:36,572
Warrior Chief, please answer me!

199
00:16:36,606 --> 00:16:39,372
Please answer me, Captain Bravo!

200
00:16:39,406 --> 00:16:40,972
-It's OK, Tokiko.

201
00:16:41,006 --> 00:16:42,939
Neither Captain
Bravo nor I regret

202
00:16:42,972 --> 00:16:44,306
the actions we have taken.

203
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:47,739

-This is my answer,
Warrior Tokiko.

212
00:17:57,706 --> 00:17:59,706
I will eliminate
Kazuki and defeat

213
00:17:59,739 --> 00:18:05,106
Victor to fulfill my duty as
Warrior Chief Captain Bravo.

-Warrior Chief!

-And once I finish,
I shall end my life

216

as Mamoru Sakimori, the
criminal responsible for killing

his subordinate.

218

Kazuki, you won't
have to die alone.

219
00:18:24,239 --> 00:18:25,539
KAZUKI: That's not right.

220
00:18:25,572 --> 00:18:27,039
You can't be serious,
Captain Bravo.

I am going to defeat you!

I will win.

I will win, and I'm not
going to let you die.

Breach.

Breach!

236
00:20:25,139 --> 00:20:26,872
TOKIKO: No hesitation.

237
00:20:26,906 --> 00:20:28,106
No doubt.

238
00:20:28,139 --> 00:20:30,106
He just simply pushed
himself forward

239
00:20:30,139 --> 00:20:35,372
with all his strength and
spirit, and pierced through it.

240
00:20:35,406 --> 00:20:39,339
-You have a strong will to
protect those precious to you.

241
00:20:39,372 --> 00:20:43,339
You threw yourself regardless of
your own safety to save Tokiko.

242
00:20:43,372 --> 00:20:45,406
You defeated Papillon
despite the pain

243
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:48,739
that it would cause you,
just to prevent more victims.

244
00:20:48,772 --> 00:20:50,739
You pushed your wounded
body to its limits

245
00:20:50,772 --> 00:20:53,872
to save Ouka and Shusui, and
fought with all your might

246
00:20:53,906 --> 00:20:56,472
to protect your friends, your
sister, and the other students

247
00:20:56,506 --> 00:20:57,672
at your school.

248
00:20:57,706 --> 00:21:00,406
You exhibit your
true, full power

249
00:21:00,439 --> 00:21:03,572
at times when you are
trying to protect others.

250
00:21:03,606 --> 00:21:05,272
It's that strong
will that drives

251
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:07,239
you to protect those
precious to you.

252
00:21:12,172 --> 00:21:16,972
I always knew there would come
a day when you would surpass me,

253
00:21:17,006 --> 00:21:19,372
and that day has come.

254
00:21:19,406 --> 00:21:22,239
Warrior Kazuki.

255
00:21:22,272 --> 00:21:24,606
-Warrior Chief.

256
00:21:24,639 --> 00:21:25,672
-Warrior Tokiko.

257
00:21:25,706 --> 00:21:26,939
-Yes?

258
00:21:26,972 --> 00:21:29,139
-Take everyone and head directly
for Newton Apple Academy

259
00:21:29,172 --> 00:21:31,839
for Girls.

260
00:21:31,872 --> 00:21:33,472
-Warrior Chief.

261
00:21:33,506 --> 00:21:37,972
-I too have decided to gamble
on that tiny ray of hope.

262
00:21:38,006 --> 00:21:39,039
-Thank you very much, sir!

263

BRAVO (VOICEOVER):
Kazuki has the potential

264
00:21:44,639 --> 00:21:47,939
to do far more good
than I ever will.

265
00:21:47,972 --> 00:21:50,306
I cannot let his life
be wasted in vain.

266
00:22:02,072 --> 00:22:03,539
-So he managed to survive, huh?

267
00:22:08,406 --> 00:22:10,139
A stubborn fellow, isn't he?

268
00:22:23,134 --> 00:22:25,968
[theme music]

269
00:23:53,868 --> 00:23:55,234
TOKIKO (VOICEOVER):
Entrusting us

270
00:23:55,268 --> 00:23:57,568
with the hope for the
future, Captain Bravo

271
00:23:57,601 --> 00:23:59,334
sacrifices himself.

272
00:23:59,368 --> 00:24:02,134
These lives that you protected
will not go to waste.

273
00:24:02,168 --> 00:24:04,568
We'll find that
tiny ray of hope.

274
00:24:04,601 --> 00:24:06,834
Next time, Gone Into Flame.

275
00:24:06,868 --> 00:24:09,001
I'll splatter your guts.

276
00:24:13,234 --> 00:24:16,234
-Mahiro Muto's Buso
Renkin seminar.

277
00:24:16,268 --> 00:24:17,068
Hi everyone!

278
00:24:17,101 --> 00:24:18,734
This is Mahiro Muto!

279
00:24:18,768 --> 00:24:20,268
Here is another
exciting introduction

280
00:24:20,301 --> 00:24:23,634
to a Buso Renkin
from yours truly.

281
00:24:23,668 --> 00:24:27,434
For our seventh round,
we have the Motor Gears.

282
00:24:27,468 --> 00:24:29,201
When we all went to
the beach this summer,

283
00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:32,601
this mysterious guy made
quite a cool entrance.

284
00:24:32,634 --> 00:24:33,968
Who is he?

285
00:24:34,001 --> 00:24:37,701
As it turned out, he's Tokiko's
junior and the newest Warrior

286
00:24:37,734 --> 00:24:39,434
in the Alchemist Army.

287
00:24:39,468 --> 00:24:40,868
But wouldn't you
agree that it was

288
00:24:40,901 --> 00:24:43,201
kind of necessary to make
such a dramatic and mysterious

289
00:24:43,234 --> 00:24:43,934
entrance?

290
00:24:43,968 --> 00:24:44,501
Oh!

291
00:24:44,534 --> 00:24:45,701
And check this.

292
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:48,334
He seems to be madly
in love with Tokiko!

293
00:24:48,368 --> 00:24:50,101
Like she means
everything to him.

294
00:24:50,134 --> 00:24:51,034
Oh boy.

295
00:24:51,068 --> 00:24:52,001
Does that mean my
big brother now

296
00:24:52,034 --> 00:24:53,434
has competition
for her affection?

297
00:24:53,468 --> 00:24:55,134
A man from Tokiko's past?

298
00:24:55,168 --> 00:24:57,601
Oh, my big brother
had better shape up.

299
00:24:57,634 --> 00:24:59,968
But I guess Kazuki doesn't
really have to worry about it,

300
00:25:00,001 --> 00:25:02,101
since they already live in
their own love universe,

301
00:25:02,134 --> 00:25:04,334
so it doesn't matter who
tries to come between them.

302
00:25:04,368 --> 00:25:04,834
Oh!

303
00:25:04,868 --> 00:25:05,834
Silly me!

304
00:25:05,868 --> 00:25:07,968
I forgot to introduce
the guy himself.

305
00:25:08,001 --> 00:25:11,134
His name is Gota
Nakamura, and in many ways

306
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:12,868
he's a very unfortunate
human being.

307
00:25:12,901 --> 00:25:13,634
Wow.

308
00:25:13,668 --> 00:25:16,034
I kinda feel bad for him.

309
00:25:16,068 --> 00:25:17,968
Anyway, this poor,
unfortunate guy's

310
00:25:18,001 --> 00:25:20,801
Buso Renkin is called
the Motor Gears.

311
00:25:20,834 --> 00:25:22,434
They are two
circular-shaped rings

312
00:25:22,468 --> 00:25:24,434
called the chakram,
an Indian weapon

313
00:25:24,468 --> 00:25:26,734
that works like a boomerang.

314
00:25:26,768 --> 00:25:29,568
Gota inputs the speed, angle,
and number of rotations

315
00:25:29,601 --> 00:25:31,634
through his bioelectricity
into the Moto Gears

316
00:25:31,668 --> 00:25:33,734
and throws them as an attack.

317
00:25:33,768 --> 00:25:34,434
Hiya!

318
00:25:34,468 --> 00:25:36,401
Oh, that sounded good.

319
00:25:36,434 --> 00:25:38,968
Anyway, he can also attach
them his hands and feet.

320
00:25:39,001 --> 00:25:42,734
For example, he can attach them
to his fists and then punch!

321
00:25:42,768 --> 00:25:44,201
That's called
Knuckle Duster mode.

322
00:25:44,234 --> 00:25:46,668
He can also attach
them to his ankles

323
00:25:46,701 --> 00:25:48,268
and move like an inline skater.

324
00:25:48,301 --> 00:25:49,234
Woosh!

325
00:25:49,268 --> 00:25:51,501
That one is called
Skywalker mode.

326
00:25:51,534 --> 00:25:54,734
And there's also one more,
the Marine Diver mode,

327
00:25:54,768 --> 00:25:56,934
which he uses like a
propeller under water.

328
00:25:56,968 --> 00:25:57,468
Cool.

329
00:25:57,501 --> 00:25:58,168
Huh?

330
00:25:58,201 --> 00:25:58,701
Oh.

331
00:25:58,734 --> 00:25:59,701
By the way.

332
00:25:59,734 --> 00:26:01,801
Of all the Buso
Renkin, the Motor Gears

333
00:26:01,834 --> 00:26:04,468
ranked the lowest
in terms of power.

334
00:26:04,501 --> 00:26:08,701
[sigh] Didn't I say he
was kind of unfortunate?

335
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:12,668
But I remember Tokiko did
say Gota's wits compensate

336
00:26:12,701 --> 00:26:14,634
for his lack of power.

337
00:26:14,668 --> 00:26:15,468
Right?

338
00:26:15,501 --> 00:26:16,934
So don't you ever, ever give up.

339
00:26:16,968 --> 00:26:19,334
Do your best, Gota Nakamaura.

340
00:26:19,368 --> 00:26:21,734
Go, go, Gota!

341
00:26:21,768 --> 00:26:22,368
All right.

342
00:26:22,401 --> 00:26:24,434
That's it for now.

343
00:26:24,468 --> 00:26:25,334
Okie dokie.

344
00:26:25,368 --> 00:26:27,468
Until next time.
