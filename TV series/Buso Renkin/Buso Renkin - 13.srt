NARRATOR: The supernatural
alloy produced

00:00:14,533 --> 00:00:18,933
by gathering the essence
of alchemy is the Kakugane.

00:00:18,966 --> 00:00:21,433
This device academics
upon a person's

4
00:00:21,466 --> 00:00:25,466
fighting instinct, manifesting
the possessor's inner power

5
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,133
into a tangible form, creating
a weapon like no other.

00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:32,200
Its name, Buso Renkin.

00:02:11,603 --> 00:02:12,769
-Are you OK, Mahiro?

10
00:02:12,803 --> 00:02:13,269
-Mm-hm.

11
00:02:13,303 --> 00:02:14,136
-And you?

12
00:02:14,169 --> 00:02:14,703
Chii-chin?

13
00:02:14,736 --> 00:02:15,336
Sally?

14
00:02:15,369 --> 00:02:16,269
-Yes.

15
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:17,236
-Yeah.

16
00:02:17,269 --> 00:02:19,569
-Tokiko's out there
fighting alone.

17
00:02:19,603 --> 00:02:22,503
I have to go back.

18
00:02:22,536 --> 00:02:25,103
-Is it true there are some
girls who got left behind?

19
00:02:25,136 --> 00:02:26,569
-Yeah, I think so.

20
00:02:26,603 --> 00:02:28,003
-You got a weapon, right?

21
00:02:28,036 --> 00:02:28,769
-Yeah!

22
00:02:28,803 --> 00:02:29,869
-All right, come on, guys!

23
00:02:29,903 --> 00:02:31,336
Abandoning those girls
would be a disgrace

24
00:02:31,369 --> 00:02:33,369
to the guys from class 2B.

25
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:34,236
Let's go!

26
00:02:34,269 --> 00:02:36,436
Bring it on, monster!

27
00:02:36,469 --> 00:02:37,603
What the--

28
00:02:37,636 --> 00:02:39,736
-Huh?

29
00:02:39,769 --> 00:02:41,036
-I'm glad you girls are safe.

30
00:02:41,069 --> 00:02:41,936
-And the monster?

31
00:02:41,969 --> 00:02:44,436
-That lance guy
just wiped it out.

32
00:02:44,469 --> 00:02:45,936
-The lance guy.

33
00:02:45,969 --> 00:02:47,903
He-- He saved our lives.

34
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:51,436
BOY: Really But
isn't he one of them?

35
00:03:01,869 --> 00:03:03,236
-Go ahead.

36
00:03:03,269 --> 00:03:05,636
Explain yourself, Suzuki.

37
00:03:05,669 --> 00:03:08,236
By any chance, could
it be you yourself

38
00:03:08,269 --> 00:03:10,169
are one who is
allied with the enemy

39
00:03:10,203 --> 00:03:12,403
out there, and not
the two outside?

40
00:03:12,436 --> 00:03:14,903
-I'm not sure which
guy to believe.

41
00:03:14,936 --> 00:03:15,403
-Uh--

42
00:03:17,503 --> 00:03:18,936
DR. BUTTERFLY
(VOICEOVER): It seems

43
00:03:18,969 --> 00:03:22,203
you are at the end
of your rope, Shinyo.

44
00:03:22,236 --> 00:03:23,469
-Master Butterfly.

45
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:24,969
DR. BUTTERFLY
(VOICEOVER): Good job.

46
00:03:25,003 --> 00:03:28,136
You did well, even
without a Kakugane.

47
00:03:28,169 --> 00:03:28,969
Yes.

48
00:03:29,003 --> 00:03:30,803
But I have no more use for you.

49
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:33,269
You'll become lunch, like
the rest of the students.

50
00:03:35,836 --> 00:03:36,703
SUZUKI: No!

51
00:03:36,736 --> 00:03:37,336
It's over!

52
00:03:37,369 --> 00:03:38,436
Everyone will die!

53
00:03:38,469 --> 00:03:39,469
Everyone will get killed!

54
00:03:39,503 --> 00:03:41,369
We're all gonna be devoured!

55
00:03:41,403 --> 00:03:42,203
-Shut up!

56
00:03:42,236 --> 00:03:43,803
-It's not over yet, you idiot!

57
00:03:43,836 --> 00:03:45,169
-That's right.

58
00:03:45,203 --> 00:03:47,169
There are those two people out
there fighting the monsters.

59
00:03:47,203 --> 00:03:49,303
We've been saying
it from the start.

60
00:03:49,336 --> 00:03:51,703
Those two people
are on our side!

61
00:03:51,736 --> 00:03:53,603
They're good guys!

62
00:03:53,636 --> 00:03:55,636
-I'll splatter your guts!

63
00:03:58,569 --> 00:04:00,436
-Energy, full blast!

64
00:04:03,836 --> 00:04:06,536
-He seems to have
regained his strength.

65
00:04:06,569 --> 00:04:09,336
Those two have turned out to
be more trouble than I thought.

66
00:04:09,369 --> 00:04:14,803
The Warriors are either stronger
than anticipated, or maybe--

67
00:04:14,836 --> 00:04:16,569
-Tokiko.

68
00:04:16,603 --> 00:04:17,403
-Kazuki.

69
00:04:17,436 --> 00:04:18,169
You all right?

70
00:04:18,203 --> 00:04:19,136
-I'm OK.

71
00:04:19,169 --> 00:04:20,569
I feel I've got more
power welling up

72
00:04:20,603 --> 00:04:21,603
than when we started.

73
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:22,903
-That's funny.

74
00:04:22,936 --> 00:04:24,969
You said the same thing when
you first fought Papillon.

75
00:04:25,003 --> 00:04:27,403
TOKIKO (VOICEOVER): It's almost
like he's drawing strength

76
00:04:27,436 --> 00:04:30,103
from others.

77
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:31,069
-Feed me!

78
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:38,369
-Tokiko.

79
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:39,536
This desk.

80
00:04:39,569 --> 00:04:40,869
-I know.

81
00:04:40,903 --> 00:04:42,936
It doesn't look like it was
aimed at us at all this time.

82
00:04:42,969 --> 00:04:43,769
BOY: Hey, come on!

83
00:04:43,803 --> 00:04:45,136
Don't let your guard down!

84
00:04:45,169 --> 00:04:47,703
Or better yet, keep the
flirting under control!

85
00:04:47,736 --> 00:04:50,203
Everybody's totally watching!

86
00:04:50,236 --> 00:04:53,169
[cheering]

87
00:04:58,669 --> 00:05:00,103
-Thank you for saving us!

88
00:05:00,136 --> 00:05:03,103
You looked kinda
cool back there!

89
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,569
-I'm really sorry for the
misunderstanding earlier.

90
00:05:05,603 --> 00:05:08,069
Thanks for saving us!

91
00:05:08,103 --> 00:05:12,069
-Go for it, big brothe-- I mean,
total stranger I don't know!

92
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:14,136
-Like I've been
saying from the start.

93
00:05:14,169 --> 00:05:15,569
They're on our side.

94
00:05:15,603 --> 00:05:17,003
They're good guys.

95
00:05:17,036 --> 00:05:20,203
If you guys are fighting for
us, then we're all on your side.

96

[cheering]

97
00:05:22,636 --> 00:05:25,469
-Thanks, guys.

98
00:05:25,503 --> 00:05:26,803
-Insignificant Humans.

99
00:05:26,836 --> 00:05:31,203
Don't be pressing your luck
when you are just simple food.

100
00:05:31,236 --> 00:05:32,169
-Feed me!

101
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:36,969
-No!

102
00:05:40,369 --> 00:05:43,236
KAZUKI: Why are they
eating each other?

103
00:05:43,269 --> 00:05:44,069
-No.

104
00:05:44,103 --> 00:05:46,136
They're not eating each other.

105
00:05:46,169 --> 00:05:46,636
They've--

106
00:05:54,403 --> 00:05:57,769
-They've merged and
turned into giants!

107
00:05:57,803 --> 00:05:58,636
-Kazuki.

108
00:05:58,669 --> 00:06:00,869
-Leave this one to me, Tokiko.

109
00:06:00,903 --> 00:06:02,269
I'll be all right.

110
00:06:02,303 --> 00:06:04,836
I feel boundless power surging
through me more than ever

111
00:06:04,869 --> 00:06:05,669
before.

112
00:06:05,703 --> 00:06:07,636
-Homunculus super adult form!

113
00:06:07,669 --> 00:06:09,003
Activate and attack.

114
00:06:14,469 --> 00:06:16,669
-Energy full blast!

115
00:06:22,669 --> 00:06:24,469
[cheering]

116
00:06:24,503 --> 00:06:26,069
DR. BUTTERFLY
(VOICEOVER): He's strong.

117
00:06:26,103 --> 00:06:28,536
TOKIKO (VOICEOVER): Too strong.

118
00:06:28,569 --> 00:06:31,903
This strength is
out of the ordinary.

119
00:06:31,936 --> 00:06:35,203
It's almost like he's
drawing strength from others.

120
00:06:35,236 --> 00:06:35,703
Wait.

121
00:06:35,736 --> 00:06:36,636
No.

122
00:06:36,669 --> 00:06:38,569
It's not just that.

123
00:06:38,603 --> 00:06:39,403
-One more to go!

124
00:06:42,536 --> 00:06:44,736
-You've gotten so
strong, Kazuki Muto.

125
00:06:44,769 --> 00:06:46,603
I can hardly recognize you.

126
00:06:46,636 --> 00:06:49,269
But, you see, I've
become stronger as well.

127
00:06:49,303 --> 00:06:51,103
-Chouno!

128
00:06:51,136 --> 00:06:55,936
BRAVO: Are there two of you
now, or is it just an illusion?

129
00:06:55,969 --> 00:06:58,669
Or perhaps you were both
there to begin with.

130
00:06:58,703 --> 00:07:00,536
-A clone, or twins?

131
00:07:00,569 --> 00:07:01,303
Come on.

132
00:07:01,336 --> 00:07:02,703
Take a closer look at us.

133
00:07:02,736 --> 00:07:04,303
-We're not identical.

134
00:07:04,336 --> 00:07:06,136
We're not the same at all.

135
00:07:06,169 --> 00:07:09,103
-I am Ninjyurokuya Moonface.

136
00:07:09,136 --> 00:07:11,136
-And I'm Sengetsu Moonface.

137
00:07:11,169 --> 00:07:15,469
-And I'm Moonface Mayutsuki.

138
00:07:15,503 --> 00:07:18,269
-Back here, you have
Moonface Hihaku.

139
00:07:18,303 --> 00:07:19,369
-Kangetsu.

-Nijusanyamachi.

-Gyokko.

-Ooh.

00:07:24,669 --> 00:07:25,969
-Beautiful.

146
00:07:26,003 --> 00:07:27,369
-Shingetsu.

147
00:07:27,403 --> 00:07:28,669
-Scary.

148
00:07:28,703 --> 00:07:31,569
-The moon's phases from 0 to 29.

149
00:07:31,603 --> 00:07:34,936
That makes 30 forms, and
30 variations of myself.

150
00:07:34,969 --> 00:07:38,236
That is the special property
of this Moonfang Buso Renkin.

151
00:07:38,269 --> 00:07:39,869
The Satellite 30.

152
00:07:39,903 --> 00:07:41,269
30 against one.

153
00:07:41,303 --> 00:07:43,169
It'll be a marathon
match for you.

154
00:07:43,203 --> 00:07:44,369
Think you can win it?

155
00:07:44,403 --> 00:07:48,969
-I'm just gonna have to
take you down one by one.

Bravo Arts, 1 of 13.

Here comes Smash Bravo Rush!

00:07:58,736 --> 00:08:00,069
Just give it up.

The Silver Skin's
defenses are invincible.

162
00:08:07,503 --> 00:08:08,503
Bring it!

00:08:15,269 --> 00:08:16,736
Moon-- moon!

-What are you gloating for?

00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,003
-Moon?

167
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:25,669
-You're the last one left.

168
00:08:25,703 --> 00:08:26,836
-Last one?

169
00:08:26,869 --> 00:08:28,236
Really?

170
00:08:28,269 --> 00:08:32,003
All 30 versions is that I create
with the satellite are really

171
00:08:32,036 --> 00:08:33,436
30 versions of me.

172
00:08:33,469 --> 00:08:37,669
So as long as I have one of me,
I can continue to replicate.

173
00:08:37,703 --> 00:08:41,369
As you can now see, no matter
how powerful your attacks are,

174
00:08:41,403 --> 00:08:44,236
you can't possibly fight
and wipe out all 30 of us

175
00:08:44,269 --> 00:08:45,569
at the same time.

176
00:08:45,603 --> 00:08:48,469
With invincible defense against
an infinitely multiplying

177
00:08:48,503 --> 00:08:51,269
enemy, this looks like
an endless battle.

178
00:08:51,303 --> 00:08:53,769
But this is human
against Homunculus,

179
00:08:53,803 --> 00:08:55,603
and I don't need
to tell you whose

180
00:08:55,636 --> 00:08:57,836
stamina is bound to last longer.

181
00:08:57,869 --> 00:09:00,303
This battle will
end with your death.

182
00:09:00,336 --> 00:09:02,903
You have fallen into
Dr. Butterfly's trap,

183
00:09:02,936 --> 00:09:05,903
and it won't be long
before he awakens.

184
00:09:05,936 --> 00:09:07,936
And once that happens,
those young warriors

185
00:09:07,969 --> 00:09:09,203
won't stand a chance.

186
00:09:11,903 --> 00:09:13,969
You don't know what
to quit, do you?

187
00:09:14,003 --> 00:09:15,636
That reminds me.

188
00:09:15,669 --> 00:09:18,703
Yes, I remember that subordinate
of yours I got rid of

189
00:09:18,736 --> 00:09:20,903
didn't know when
to quit, either.

190
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:22,003
Rather annoying.

191
00:09:22,036 --> 00:09:25,436
It took us two full
days to finish him off.

192
00:09:25,469 --> 00:09:26,836
-I see.

193
00:09:26,869 --> 00:09:28,936
So he didn't know
when to quit, huh?

194
00:09:28,969 --> 00:09:30,269
-Moon?

195
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:34,069
-So he fought through to the
very end with a strong will.

196
00:09:34,103 --> 00:09:35,869
Then Bravo.

197
00:09:35,903 --> 00:09:37,069
-The number 52 Kakugane?

198
00:09:37,103 --> 00:09:40,069
-It's the one they
took back from Kinjo!

199
00:09:40,103 --> 00:09:46,536
-Activate Silver
Skin, Alternate Type!

200
00:09:46,569 --> 00:09:49,169
You're foolish if you think
Alchemist Warriors are just

201
00:09:49,203 --> 00:09:50,869
simple soldiers.

202
00:09:50,903 --> 00:09:52,636
Warrior Tokiko
and Warrior Kazuki

203
00:09:52,669 --> 00:09:56,169
will fight to the very end, no
matter what you throw at them.

204
00:09:56,203 --> 00:09:59,303
I will not allow another
one of my men to die again.

205
00:09:59,336 --> 00:10:04,736
[roaring]

206
00:10:04,769 --> 00:10:06,703
-Who the hell is that?

207
00:10:06,736 --> 00:10:08,336
-I see that urban legend guy.

208
00:10:08,369 --> 00:10:10,736
BOY: That's the
floating pervert?

209
00:10:10,769 --> 00:10:12,736
BOY: You're right, it's him!

210
00:10:12,769 --> 00:10:14,636
BOY: Is he a friend, or foe?

211
00:10:14,669 --> 00:10:16,669
-I don't remember summoning you.

212
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:18,203
What are you doing here?

213
00:10:18,236 --> 00:10:20,503
-Well, let me see.

214
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:23,269
I guess you could say I'm here
to prove to you how far I can

215
00:10:23,303 --> 00:10:26,203
go, and how high I
can fly on my own.

216
00:10:26,236 --> 00:10:27,736
-Those wings.

217
00:10:27,769 --> 00:10:29,036
It's a Buso Renkin.

218
00:10:29,069 --> 00:10:30,369
-Precisely.

219
00:10:30,403 --> 00:10:33,236
I call them Near
Death Happiness.

220
00:10:33,269 --> 00:10:35,936
I can change their
shape at will.

221
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:38,369
I can move them at will!

222
00:10:38,403 --> 00:10:42,769
I can ignite at will.

223
00:10:42,803 --> 00:10:46,703
Black Powder, Buso Renkin!

224
00:10:46,736 --> 00:10:49,469
Powerful, if I do
think say so myself.

225
00:10:49,503 --> 00:10:49,969
-No!

226
00:10:50,003 --> 00:10:50,469
-No!

227
00:10:50,503 --> 00:10:52,269
-No!

228
00:10:52,303 --> 00:10:54,703
-I don't need your
protection anymore.

229
00:10:54,736 --> 00:10:57,869
Thanks for everything,
Great Grandfather.

230
00:10:57,903 --> 00:11:00,769
I guess I'll show you
my gratitude first.

231
00:11:00,803 --> 00:11:02,436
And then, let's see.

232
00:11:02,469 --> 00:11:04,336
I could burn this
school to the ground,

233
00:11:04,369 --> 00:11:07,403
since all I have from there are
unpleasant memories, anyway.

234
00:11:07,436 --> 00:11:11,769
And then last, but not least--

235
00:11:11,803 --> 00:11:13,469
-All right, Chouno.

236
00:11:13,503 --> 00:11:15,903
However, the order in that list
is going to have to change.

237
00:11:15,936 --> 00:11:19,469
First, I'm going to have to
settle things with the LXE.

238
00:11:19,503 --> 00:11:21,136
Then I'll deal with you.

239
00:11:21,169 --> 00:11:22,369
-Very well.

240
00:11:22,403 --> 00:11:26,069
-How dare you treat me,
the great Dr. Butterfly,

241
00:11:26,103 --> 00:11:27,736
like a mere opening act.

242
00:11:27,769 --> 00:11:31,203
I'll take all of you on,
including the female Alchemist

243
00:11:31,236 --> 00:11:32,536
Warrior.

244
00:11:32,569 --> 00:11:35,736
I will show you the power of
Shishaku Chouno, Homunculus

245
00:11:35,769 --> 00:11:39,503
and Founder of the LXE,
whose mighty power has

246
00:11:39,536 --> 00:11:43,969
been cultivating and growing
for the past hundred years!

247
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:46,969
[siren]

248
00:11:47,003 --> 00:11:52,936
[siren]

249
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:56,556
-My ears hurt!

250
00:11:56,589 --> 00:12:00,056
-What's that sound?

251
00:12:00,089 --> 00:12:01,489
DR. BUTTERFLY: The alarm.

252
00:12:01,523 --> 00:12:05,489
He, my friend, has awakened.

253
00:12:15,489 --> 00:12:17,423
-What the--

254
00:12:17,456 --> 00:12:18,923
-Angel Gozen!

255
00:12:18,956 --> 00:12:20,423
-I-- feel weak.

256
00:12:20,456 --> 00:12:21,923
-Suddenly I--

257
00:12:21,956 --> 00:12:22,923
-Chii-chin!

258
00:12:22,956 --> 00:12:24,423
Sally!

259
00:12:24,456 --> 00:12:26,889
What is going on?

260
00:12:26,923 --> 00:12:28,389
[groaning]

261
00:12:28,423 --> 00:12:29,889
-It's like--

262
00:12:29,923 --> 00:12:33,356
-My strength is being
sucked out of me.

263
00:12:33,389 --> 00:12:35,256
DR. BUTTERFLY: This
is how he feeds.

264
00:12:35,289 --> 00:12:37,456
He doesn't bother eating flesh.

265
00:12:37,489 --> 00:12:39,856
That has very poor
absorption efficiency.

266
00:12:39,889 --> 00:12:42,423
He takes away the
life force directly,

267
00:12:42,456 --> 00:12:45,956
and transforms it into
energy for himself.

268
00:12:45,989 --> 00:12:47,923
-This is bad, Kazuki.

269
00:12:47,956 --> 00:12:50,389
If we don't do
something quickly,

270
00:12:50,423 --> 00:12:53,856
everyone will have their
lives drained out of them!

271
00:12:53,889 --> 00:12:55,123
-I won't let that happen.

272
00:12:55,156 --> 00:12:55,956
No!

273
00:12:55,989 --> 00:12:57,489
-Be quiet, insolent boy.

274
00:12:57,523 --> 00:13:00,956
That line belongs to Dr.
Butterfly, now renamed

275
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:02,556
Master Butterfly!

276
00:13:02,589 --> 00:13:03,056
Ah!

277
00:13:05,923 --> 00:13:07,323
-There is no need
to follow through

278
00:13:07,356 --> 00:13:09,856
with the order Muto
had made, now is there?

279
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:12,756
If you're going to go
along with anything at all,

280
00:13:12,789 --> 00:13:14,356
we should just do it my way.

281
00:13:14,389 --> 00:13:15,123
-Chouno!

282
00:13:15,156 --> 00:13:16,323
-Don't bother.

283
00:13:16,356 --> 00:13:18,756
Let them be, if they want
to take each other out.

284
00:13:18,789 --> 00:13:20,056
We need to--

285
00:13:20,089 --> 00:13:21,223
-That's right.

286
00:13:21,256 --> 00:13:22,223
First things first.

287
00:13:22,256 --> 00:13:23,589
We've got to go
up there and stop

288
00:13:23,623 --> 00:13:25,356
the flask as soon as possible.

289
00:13:25,389 --> 00:13:26,056
Let's go, Tokiko.

290
00:13:29,656 --> 00:13:32,589
-You are such a
pathetic amateur.

291
00:13:32,623 --> 00:13:35,123
So tell me, this is how
you show me your gratitude

292
00:13:35,156 --> 00:13:36,623
after saving your life?

293
00:13:36,656 --> 00:13:39,723
-You just used me as a
guinea pig to test your tank,

294
00:13:39,756 --> 00:13:40,823
so we're even now.

295
00:13:40,856 --> 00:13:42,256
-And what about the Kakugane?

296
00:13:42,289 --> 00:13:43,823
Where does that fall?

297
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:46,556
-I got that on my
own, without any help.

298
00:13:46,589 --> 00:13:48,723
However, there is
something I'm still

299
00:13:48,756 --> 00:13:51,056
grateful for, Great Grandfather.

300
00:13:51,089 --> 00:13:53,289
The scraps of research
you left behind,

301
00:13:53,323 --> 00:13:54,789
which brought me to this day.

302
00:13:54,823 --> 00:13:57,323
And of course,
this fabulous suit.

303
00:13:57,356 --> 00:13:59,989
But as for you protecting
me, it's kind of bothersome

304
00:14:00,023 --> 00:14:02,123
that you believe I am that weak.

305
00:14:02,156 --> 00:14:04,223
I don't need your
protection, anyway.

306
00:14:04,256 --> 00:14:06,756
And to prove it, it'll
cost you your life.

307
00:14:06,789 --> 00:14:08,556
-Are you rebelling against me?

308
00:14:08,589 --> 00:14:10,689
Then that means your
death has been ordained.

309
00:14:10,723 --> 00:14:12,089
-Really?

310
00:14:12,123 --> 00:14:14,623
I've already learned the special
property of your Buso Renkin.

311
00:14:14,656 --> 00:14:16,623
It affects the nervous
system and disrupts

312
00:14:16,656 --> 00:14:18,123
one's sense of direction.

313
00:14:18,156 --> 00:14:20,823
You're no match for my
Near Death Happiness.

314
00:14:20,856 --> 00:14:22,056
-You are such a fool.

315
00:14:22,089 --> 00:14:25,323
You've only seen my Buso
Renkin in a diffused state.

316
00:14:25,356 --> 00:14:29,056
Its power in a concentrated
state is simply unimaginable.

317
00:14:29,089 --> 00:14:33,356
Prepare yourself for the
true power of my Buso Renkin!

318
00:14:33,389 --> 00:14:34,823
-What's this?

319
00:14:34,856 --> 00:14:36,223
Oh!

320
00:14:36,256 --> 00:14:37,089
Oh, no!

321
00:14:37,123 --> 00:14:37,923
My mask!

322
00:14:37,956 --> 00:14:40,556
Without it, I'm-- I'm not me!

323
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:41,523
No!

324
00:14:41,556 --> 00:14:42,489
No!

325
00:14:42,523 --> 00:14:43,456
There it is!

326
00:14:43,489 --> 00:14:45,256
It's right over there!

327
00:14:45,289 --> 00:14:46,089
Wait!

328
00:14:46,123 --> 00:14:46,589
Wait!

329
00:14:46,623 --> 00:14:47,389
-Hey!

330
00:14:47,423 --> 00:14:49,923
No running in the hallways.

331
00:14:49,956 --> 00:14:50,756
What is that?

332
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:52,323
You're still coming to school?

333
00:14:52,356 --> 00:14:55,223
Do us all a favor
and just drop out.

334
00:14:55,256 --> 00:14:57,156
-Mita?

335
00:14:57,189 --> 00:14:58,456
-Hey!

336
00:14:58,489 --> 00:15:00,223
Watch where you're going,
you spoiled little weakling.

337
00:15:00,256 --> 00:15:01,256
-Saruwatari.

338
00:15:01,289 --> 00:15:02,723
[laughter]

339
00:15:02,756 --> 00:15:04,623
-Huh?

340
00:15:04,656 --> 00:15:06,556
-And this means you--

341
00:15:06,589 --> 00:15:08,489
-Kawazui?

342
00:15:08,523 --> 00:15:11,989
-So, you are dying
of a fatal disease.

343
00:15:12,023 --> 00:15:13,123
-Hanabusa?

344
00:15:13,156 --> 00:15:16,189
-In that case, I guess
you are of no use to me.

345
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:19,156
-So this is where you've
been wasting your time, huh?

346
00:15:19,189 --> 00:15:21,423
We need to start training
you as soon as possible.

347
00:15:21,456 --> 00:15:24,323
If you go on like this,
you'll never be worth a thing.

348
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:25,789
-Don't bother, Washio.

349
00:15:25,823 --> 00:15:27,689
I've already written
this guy off.

350
00:15:27,723 --> 00:15:30,456
I've decided Jiro
will be my successor.

351
00:15:30,489 --> 00:15:31,656
-That's right.

352
00:15:31,689 --> 00:15:34,289
Everything from the Chouno
family belongs to me,

353
00:15:34,323 --> 00:15:36,089
and that means this, too.

354
00:15:36,123 --> 00:15:39,523
So, how do I look?

355
00:15:39,556 --> 00:15:42,956
[scream]

356
00:15:42,989 --> 00:15:46,589
-This is the true special
property of my Buso Renkin.

357
00:15:46,623 --> 00:15:49,356
When I concentrate it
and raise the density,

358
00:15:49,389 --> 00:15:52,523
it affects the brain and
causes hallucinations.

359
00:15:52,556 --> 00:15:56,923
This is my Chaff Buso
Renkin, Alice in Wonderland.

360
00:15:56,956 --> 00:16:00,889
I'll crush your mind and spirit,
killing you little by little!

361
00:16:00,923 --> 00:16:03,423
-Before that, I'll
burn you to ashes!

362
00:16:03,456 --> 00:16:04,789
[laughter]

363
00:16:04,823 --> 00:16:06,556
-Someone like you has no chance.

364
00:16:06,589 --> 00:16:09,256
And you want to know why?

365
00:16:09,289 --> 00:16:11,889
Let me explain!

366
00:16:11,923 --> 00:16:14,423
You have already
plunged into Wonderland,

367
00:16:14,456 --> 00:16:16,256
and you can no longer
tell the difference

368
00:16:16,289 --> 00:16:18,323
between reality and illusion.

369
00:16:18,356 --> 00:16:21,523
My voice might not even
be reaching you right now.

370
00:16:21,556 --> 00:16:24,656
Even though we are part
of the same Chouno clan,

371
00:16:24,689 --> 00:16:26,756
we are of a different caliber.

372
00:16:26,789 --> 00:16:30,123
I encountered ultimate
life, and used alchemy

373
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:31,823
as a means for evolution.

374
00:16:31,856 --> 00:16:34,223
But you just used alchemy
to cope and escape

375
00:16:34,256 --> 00:16:36,423
the fear of death.

376
00:16:36,456 --> 00:16:39,589
You are a coward, and you're
weak in both body and soul,

377
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:42,089
so you're finished
now, Koushaku.

378
00:16:42,123 --> 00:16:44,389
-Don't call me by that name.

379
00:16:44,423 --> 00:16:45,589
-Huh?

380
00:16:45,623 --> 00:16:49,123
-That may have been true
when we were still humans.

381
00:16:49,156 --> 00:16:51,256
Things are different now.

382
00:16:51,289 --> 00:16:52,589
Completely different.

383
00:16:55,323 --> 00:16:57,289
My name is Papillon!

384
00:17:03,256 --> 00:17:04,723
-What is this, Koushaku?

385
00:17:04,756 --> 00:17:06,789
-I said, don't call
me by that name.

386
00:17:06,823 --> 00:17:09,656
There's only one person who
is allowed to call me that.

387
00:17:09,689 --> 00:17:12,789
He is the only one who watched
the death of the man you say

388
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:15,356
is both weak in mind and body.

389
00:17:15,389 --> 00:17:16,789
Come on, Great Grandfather.

390
00:17:16,823 --> 00:17:18,056
Bring it on.

391
00:17:18,089 --> 00:17:20,223
Then I can blow up reality
and illusion all at once,

392
00:17:20,256 --> 00:17:21,289
and you with it.

393
00:17:21,323 --> 00:17:22,423
-Very well, then.

394
00:17:22,456 --> 00:17:25,189
I'll just have to use a
different hallucination.

395
00:17:25,223 --> 00:17:27,289
-I wonder if just one will do?

396
00:17:27,323 --> 00:17:29,623
-Lose yourself in Wonderland!

397
00:17:33,589 --> 00:17:36,289
-Wonderland eats away
at a person's brain

398
00:17:36,323 --> 00:17:38,023
with a powerful
emission of light.

399
00:17:38,056 --> 00:17:39,923
But all it takes is
just a small explosion

400
00:17:39,956 --> 00:17:42,389
to block your flash
from one's vision.

401
00:17:42,423 --> 00:17:43,723
I figured you out.

402
00:17:43,756 --> 00:17:45,089
It wasn't that hard.

403
00:17:45,123 --> 00:17:49,289
Besides, before I got sick,
I was something of a genius.

404
00:17:49,323 --> 00:17:50,289
That's right.

405
00:17:50,323 --> 00:17:52,589
I've got my intellect
to work with.

406
00:17:52,623 --> 00:17:55,556
I've already made my next move.

407
00:17:55,589 --> 00:17:59,956
Maximum acceleration,
Butterflies of Black Death.

408
00:17:59,989 --> 00:18:01,256
Ah!

409
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:02,856
-What's the matter, genius?

410
00:18:02,889 --> 00:18:05,156
What are you so surprised about?

411
00:18:05,189 --> 00:18:08,923
If you're a genius, then I
happen to be a super genius.

412
00:18:08,956 --> 00:18:10,323
I'm prepared for anything.

413
00:18:10,356 --> 00:18:11,689
Have you forgotten?

414
00:18:11,723 --> 00:18:14,923
My Alice in Wonderland throws
off your sense of direction.

415
00:18:14,956 --> 00:18:17,123
Inside this fog,
you couldn't hit me

416
00:18:17,156 --> 00:18:18,789
if I was standing two feet away.

417
00:18:18,823 --> 00:18:21,189
Ah, and here's one more thing.

418
00:18:21,223 --> 00:18:24,289
Not only is your sense of
direction thrown off, but also

419
00:18:24,323 --> 00:18:26,523
your sense of distance, as well.

420
00:18:26,556 --> 00:18:27,323
-Oh, no!

421
00:18:31,689 --> 00:18:34,556
-I was thrown off since
you and that lance boy

422
00:18:34,589 --> 00:18:36,089
disrupted my plan.

423
00:18:36,123 --> 00:18:38,289
But I shouldn't
have lost my temper.

424
00:18:38,323 --> 00:18:42,223
I could deal with you easily
by remaining calm, as I am now.

425
00:18:42,256 --> 00:18:45,556
I knew you couldn't fly high
and far by yourself, after all.

426
00:18:51,223 --> 00:18:54,823
Now you look like the good for
nothing that you really are.

427
00:18:54,856 --> 00:18:57,856
You would have been much better
off giving up your stupid pride

428
00:18:57,889 --> 00:19:00,323
and accepting the
protection you were given.

429
00:19:00,356 --> 00:19:02,923
In the end, the only
good thing you ever did

430
00:19:02,956 --> 00:19:05,756
was to be the foundation
for his resurrection.

431
00:19:05,789 --> 00:19:09,823
But I have no more use
for you, so perish.

432
00:19:09,856 --> 00:19:13,189
-That man-- the one
up there in the flask.

433
00:19:13,223 --> 00:19:15,856
Tell me, what's
his true identity?

434
00:19:15,889 --> 00:19:17,723
Is he really a Homunculus?

435
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:20,656
-Do you really think the man
who is the king of all Homunculi

436
00:19:20,689 --> 00:19:23,189
would be the same as
an ordinary Homunculus?

437
00:19:23,223 --> 00:19:25,789
He is neither human
nor Homunculus,

438
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:27,856
but a third type of
people who stands

439
00:19:27,889 --> 00:19:29,356
at the pinnacle of all life.

440
00:19:29,389 --> 00:19:31,623
He can even feed on Homunculi.

441
00:19:31,656 --> 00:19:35,789
He is the ultimate life
form on this planet.

442
00:19:35,823 --> 00:19:38,156
When we met for
the first time, I

443
00:19:38,189 --> 00:19:40,489
as a scholar,
alchemist, and human

444
00:19:40,523 --> 00:19:43,989
was able to see his greatness,
and immediately threw myself

445
00:19:44,023 --> 00:19:45,256
at his feet.

446
00:19:45,289 --> 00:19:48,656
My mission in life became
to heal his damaged body,

447
00:19:48,689 --> 00:19:51,056
and resurrect him at any cost.

448
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:53,023
And for that very
purpose alone ,

449
00:19:53,056 --> 00:19:55,623
I became a human
type Homunculus.

450
00:19:55,656 --> 00:19:59,756
Even you, who do not know
your own place in the world,

451
00:19:59,789 --> 00:20:02,523
would have understood if
you had seen his power.

452
00:20:02,556 --> 00:20:06,623
But unfortunately, at this
point it is too late for you.

453
00:20:06,656 --> 00:20:08,189
PAPILLON: Oh, I don't
know about that.

454
00:20:08,223 --> 00:20:09,423
-Huh?

455
00:20:09,456 --> 00:20:11,523
-My Black Death Butterflies
fill the air around us.

456
00:20:11,556 --> 00:20:14,823
360 degrees,
disregarding distance.

457
00:20:14,856 --> 00:20:17,589
With this kind of shield, your
Buso Renkin will be useless,

458
00:20:17,623 --> 00:20:18,923
don't you think?

459
00:20:18,956 --> 00:20:20,689
Have you gone mad?

460
00:20:20,723 --> 00:20:23,123
If you do this, even
you will blow up!

461
00:20:23,156 --> 00:20:27,356
-Well, I died once already, so
I'm really not worried at all.

462
00:20:27,389 --> 00:20:27,856
-Wait!

463
00:20:27,889 --> 00:20:28,823
Stop!

464
00:20:28,856 --> 00:20:30,889
-Why not give death
a try, yourself?

465
00:20:30,923 --> 00:20:32,789
You might find it as
addictive as I did!

466
00:20:42,956 --> 00:20:44,356
Still there.

467
00:20:44,389 --> 00:20:48,823
And you say it surpasses
both humans and Homunculi?

468
00:20:48,856 --> 00:20:50,956
I was convinced the
humanoid Homunculus

469
00:20:50,989 --> 00:20:53,223
was the ultimate life form.

470
00:20:53,256 --> 00:20:57,756
But now you tell me there's
something even greater.

471
00:20:57,789 --> 00:21:01,456
-If you don't want to take my
word for it, see for yourself.

472
00:21:01,489 --> 00:21:04,256
Go ahead and discover how
insignificant you are.

473
00:21:04,289 --> 00:21:07,656
-Then I suppose that must have
been what happened to you.

474
00:21:07,689 --> 00:21:09,289
And that's why you
settled for being

475
00:21:09,323 --> 00:21:11,289
just a humanoid Homunculus?

476
00:21:11,323 --> 00:21:13,423
If you knew of
further heights, why

477
00:21:13,456 --> 00:21:15,389
didn't you attempt
to flap your wings?

478
00:21:15,423 --> 00:21:16,089
[groan]

479
00:21:16,123 --> 00:21:17,456
PAPILLON: I've decided.

480
00:21:17,489 --> 00:21:20,423
I'll cast off this
imperfect body of mine,

481
00:21:20,456 --> 00:21:24,089
and flap my wings toward
even greater heights.

482
00:21:24,123 --> 00:21:27,323
Great Grandfather, we are
alike, yet so different.

483
00:21:27,356 --> 00:21:29,156
You flutter around
a dazzling light,

484
00:21:29,189 --> 00:21:31,356
unable to fly high alone.

485
00:21:31,389 --> 00:21:34,489
As far as I'm concerned,
you're no butterfly.

486
00:21:34,523 --> 00:21:37,856
You're just an ugly moth.

487
00:21:37,889 --> 00:21:38,923
-Don't stop, Kazuki!

488
00:21:38,956 --> 00:21:39,556
-I know.

489
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:40,723
Let's keep moving!

490
00:21:40,756 --> 00:21:43,489
-We have to get up to the
roof as fast as we can.

491
00:21:43,523 --> 00:21:45,423
We cannot waste one second

492
00:21:45,456 --> 00:21:45,923
-I know!

493
00:21:48,889 --> 00:21:52,756
KAZUKI (VOICEOVER):
I know, but--

494
00:21:52,789 --> 00:21:54,956
-Kazuki, what is it?

495
00:21:54,989 --> 00:21:55,889
This is--

496
00:22:01,156 --> 00:22:02,289
-My friends.

497
00:22:02,323 --> 00:22:03,889
-Kazuki!

498
00:22:03,923 --> 00:22:05,789
Don't open it, Kazuki.

499
00:22:05,823 --> 00:22:07,923
I know what you're
feeling, but it's important

500
00:22:07,956 --> 00:22:09,423
that we keep moving.

501
00:22:09,456 --> 00:22:10,523
Don't open it.

502
00:22:10,556 --> 00:22:12,256
TOKIKO (VOICEOVER):
If you open that door,

503
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:14,589
you won't be able to go on.

504
00:22:14,623 --> 00:22:16,156
-I'm sorry.

505
00:22:16,189 --> 00:22:19,089
I just can't pass right by.

506
00:22:19,123 --> 00:22:21,589
-Kazuki!

507
00:22:23,345 --> 00:22:27,245
[theme music]

508
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:57,833
TOKIKO" Beautiful shining
hair, glistening bronze skin.

509
00:23:57,867 --> 00:23:59,833
Neither human nor Homunculus.

510
00:23:59,867 --> 00:24:02,200
A different kind of being.

511
00:24:02,233 --> 00:24:04,000
What have I done, Kazuki?

512
00:24:04,033 --> 00:24:06,433
Next time, Who Are You?

513
00:24:06,467 --> 00:24:09,967
I'll splatter your guts!
