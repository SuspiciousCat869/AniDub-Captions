NARRATOR: The supernatural
alloy produced

2
00:00:15,048 --> 00:00:19,382
by gathering the essence
of alchemy is the kakugane.

3
00:00:19,415 --> 00:00:23,315
This device activates upon a
person's fighting instinct,

4
00:00:23,348 --> 00:00:25,948
manifesting the
possessor's inner power

5
00:00:25,982 --> 00:00:30,615
into a tangible form, creating
a weapon like no other.

6
00:00:30,648 --> 00:00:32,115
Its name?

7
00:00:32,148 --> 00:00:33,115
Buso Renkin.

8
00:00:35,748 --> 00:00:39,715
[music playing]

9
00:02:09,279 --> 00:02:11,812
-I'm glad you accepted
our challenge.

10
00:02:11,846 --> 00:02:14,079
As you can tell, we
don't need any assistance

11
00:02:14,112 --> 00:02:15,979
or any interference.

12
00:02:16,012 --> 00:02:18,846
So it'll just be
two against two.

13
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,079
The both of you are very
popular with the other students.

14
00:02:22,112 --> 00:02:25,212
If you take advantage of that
popularity to set up a trap,

15
00:02:25,246 --> 00:02:28,346
you could potentially make
victims out dozens of students.

16
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:29,946
But now that I know
you're enemies,

17
00:02:29,979 --> 00:02:32,212
I'll take you out quick.

18
00:02:32,246 --> 00:02:33,879
Of course we'll accept.

19
00:02:33,912 --> 00:02:35,046
-Oh my.

20
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:38,046
But do you think you could
wait another 30 minutes

21
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:41,412
until the security guards
make their final rounds?

22
00:02:41,446 --> 00:02:44,579
After that we can turn
off the security system

23
00:02:44,612 --> 00:02:47,912
and we won't have to worry
about any more interruptions.

24
00:02:47,946 --> 00:02:50,812
And then we'll fight
without reservation.

25
00:02:50,846 --> 00:02:52,812
-You don't look so good, Kazuki.

26
00:02:52,846 --> 00:02:55,046
Do you think you
can fight like that?

27
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:57,212
When you said you wanted
to become as strong as you

28
00:02:57,246 --> 00:02:59,412
possibly could, I
thought those were

29
00:02:59,446 --> 00:03:01,412
words coming from
a warrior preparing

30
00:03:01,446 --> 00:03:03,012
himself to defeat the enemy.

31
00:03:03,046 --> 00:03:05,446
Were those words just a lie?

32
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:07,179
-It wasn't a lie.

33
00:03:07,212 --> 00:03:08,479
I meant it.

34
00:03:08,512 --> 00:03:12,346
But I thought you two were
friends, dependable seniors

35
00:03:12,379 --> 00:03:14,512
that we could rely on.

36
00:03:14,546 --> 00:03:18,079
I thought you were people I
was supposed to protect and not

37
00:03:18,112 --> 00:03:19,612
enemies that I'd have to fight.

38
00:03:19,646 --> 00:03:20,679
-That's right.

39
00:03:20,712 --> 00:03:23,512
You did indeed protect
us before, Kazuki.

40
00:03:23,546 --> 00:03:24,679
Thank you.

41
00:03:24,712 --> 00:03:26,512
I'm sorry to
disappoint you, but--

42
00:03:26,546 --> 00:03:28,046
-We don't need
you to protect us.

43
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:30,446
We can take care of ourselves.

44
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:34,579
All we need is the power
to make our wish come true.

45
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:45,579
[footsteps]

46
00:03:45,612 --> 00:03:48,479
-Looks like the second
gymnasium's all clear.

47
00:03:48,512 --> 00:03:50,579
-Yeah, it's all clear.

48
00:03:50,612 --> 00:03:52,546
-Well, that's it for the rounds.

49
00:03:52,579 --> 00:03:53,912
Let's get out of here.

50
00:03:53,946 --> 00:03:54,612
-Yep.

51
00:03:54,646 --> 00:03:58,012
Let's get out of here.

52
00:03:58,046 --> 00:03:59,112
-Alrighty.

53
00:03:59,146 --> 00:04:03,679
Time for a little nap,
Mr. security system.

54
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:07,879
Now even if windows break or a
fire occurs or if people die,

55
00:04:07,912 --> 00:04:10,612
for that matter, this
school will be all clear

56
00:04:10,646 --> 00:04:12,012
for a couple of hours.

57
00:04:12,046 --> 00:04:14,279
At least until midnight.

58
00:04:14,312 --> 00:04:15,379
-Are they gone?

59
00:04:15,412 --> 00:04:16,879
-Mm-hmm.

60
00:04:16,912 --> 00:04:20,412
Boy, this school
has lousy security.

61
00:04:20,446 --> 00:04:21,846
-Well, that's the
kind of work you

62
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:24,446
get from unmotivated people.

63
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,179
The same goes for you.

64
00:04:26,212 --> 00:04:27,612
-What?

65
00:04:27,646 --> 00:04:31,079
-A warrior who's not willing to
fight isn't much good either.

66
00:04:31,112 --> 00:04:33,679
So if you don't want to fight
those siblings, then go home.

67
00:04:33,712 --> 00:04:35,346
-Of course I'll fight.

68
00:04:35,379 --> 00:04:37,846
I decided to become a
warrior and I'm here,

69
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:40,546
ready to protect people
from the Humunculi.

70
00:04:40,579 --> 00:04:42,879
-That's just what I'd
expect you to say.

71
00:04:42,912 --> 00:04:45,246
We would hate to miss
the chance to take out

72
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:47,646
two warriors at once.

73
00:04:47,679 --> 00:04:51,412
The number of people
now is two against two.

74
00:04:55,612 --> 00:04:58,079
It's time.

75
00:04:58,112 --> 00:04:59,412
Now let's duel.

76
00:04:59,446 --> 00:05:02,046
-But it looks like
Ouka isn't here yet.

77
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:05,546
-You don't have to concern
yourself with my older sister.

78
00:05:05,579 --> 00:05:08,179
I can take you one at a
time or both together.

79
00:05:08,212 --> 00:05:10,679
And to make up for the
surprise attack earlier,

80
00:05:10,712 --> 00:05:12,812
I'll let you guys
have the first move.

81
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:14,912
-You pretend to hold up
the spirit of Bushido

82
00:05:14,946 --> 00:05:17,146
despite being a Humunculus?

83
00:05:17,179 --> 00:05:20,046
-Tokiko, I want you
to leave this to me.

84
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:21,746
Listen, Shusui.

85
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:23,946
We'll fight one on one like
we've done in sparring.

86
00:05:27,546 --> 00:05:30,512
-Fine, but only until
Ouka Hayasaka shows up.

87
00:05:30,546 --> 00:05:32,512
-Thank you.

88
00:05:32,546 --> 00:05:34,212
Here I go.

89
00:05:34,246 --> 00:05:34,779
Buso Renkin!

90
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:48,879
He blocked it with a kakugane!

91
00:05:48,912 --> 00:05:51,012
-I granted you the first move.

92
00:05:51,046 --> 00:05:52,379
Now it's my turn.

93
00:05:52,412 --> 00:05:53,646
Let's go.

94
00:05:53,679 --> 00:05:56,879
Buso Renkin!

95
00:05:56,912 --> 00:05:58,846
-Its sharpness, it's not normal.

96
00:06:02,712 --> 00:06:05,912
As I suspected, Shusui
Hayasaka's Buso Renkin

97
00:06:05,946 --> 00:06:09,079
is a katana sword.

98
00:06:09,112 --> 00:06:09,812
-Get ready.

99
00:06:23,046 --> 00:06:24,846
-Unlike the bamboo
sword from practice,

100
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:26,912
the slightest touch of
that thing could be fatal.

101
00:06:26,946 --> 00:06:28,546
Just focus on that blade.

102
00:06:37,912 --> 00:06:38,379
-Kazuki!

103
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:43,112
-I'm all right.

104
00:06:43,146 --> 00:06:45,379
I can still handle it.

105
00:06:45,412 --> 00:06:47,046
-Are you sure about that?

106
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:50,112
I didn't think you'd all so
easily just from this item.

107
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:15,946
-My plan worked perfectly.

108
00:07:15,979 --> 00:07:18,512
Now we can fight without
wrecking the school.

109
00:07:18,546 --> 00:07:19,546
-Oh, really?

110
00:07:19,579 --> 00:07:21,012
-Good idea.

111
00:07:21,046 --> 00:07:22,346
Very well.

112
00:07:22,379 --> 00:07:26,246
It will also be easier to
clean up your blood out here.

113
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,046
-Here I go!

114
00:07:38,012 --> 00:07:39,179
-One down.

115
00:07:39,212 --> 00:07:41,046
One left.

116
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:44,846
-So your sister likes
ambush tactics, huh?

117
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,612
That's more like it.

118
00:07:46,646 --> 00:07:50,346
Now you're both
acting like Humunculi.

119
00:07:50,379 --> 00:07:52,279
The roof, huh?

120
00:07:52,312 --> 00:07:54,946
Kazuki, I'll go take
care of the sister

121
00:07:54,979 --> 00:07:57,579
and leave you to
take care of him.

122
00:07:57,612 --> 00:08:00,712
-Your Death Scythes are more
efficient than I thought.

123
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:03,279
But they will never reach her.

124
00:08:03,312 --> 00:08:06,979
Now, Kazuki, shall you
and I get back to it?

125
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,012
Because of you, I've
had some good training.

126
00:08:13,046 --> 00:08:14,146
Thank you.

127
00:08:14,179 --> 00:08:16,546
You're definitely
getting stronger.

128
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,546
But of course, I am too.

129
00:08:18,579 --> 00:08:21,146
It appears that you and
I get along very well.

130
00:08:24,746 --> 00:08:25,646
-Kazuki.

131
00:08:25,679 --> 00:08:27,812
-Don't worry.

132
00:08:27,846 --> 00:08:29,212
I know.

133
00:08:29,246 --> 00:08:31,779
I just have to think about all
the suffering his sister would

134
00:08:31,812 --> 00:08:33,846
be inflicting upon others.

135
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:34,712
It's OK.

136
00:08:34,746 --> 00:08:35,646
I can still fight.

137
00:08:43,379 --> 00:08:46,779
Energy full blast!

138
00:08:46,812 --> 00:08:48,179
Sunlight crasher!

139
00:08:52,046 --> 00:08:53,312
-I see.

140
00:08:53,346 --> 00:08:56,346
This special feature of that
lance is that cloth alone.

141
00:08:56,379 --> 00:08:58,612
It materializes
life force energy,

142
00:08:58,646 --> 00:08:59,846
converting it into an attack.

143
00:09:05,046 --> 00:09:05,512
However.

144
00:09:12,412 --> 00:09:13,046
-What?

145
00:09:13,079 --> 00:09:13,946
The energy is fading!

146
00:09:18,446 --> 00:09:20,946
-Any amount of energy
is absorbed by the blade

147
00:09:20,979 --> 00:09:24,212
and then expelled from the
cord that hangs from the hilt.

148
00:09:24,246 --> 00:09:27,312
This is the special
property of my Buso Renkin.

149
00:09:27,346 --> 00:09:31,179
Sword Samurai X.
Your energy based

150
00:09:31,212 --> 00:09:33,746
attacks are useless against me.

151
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:34,679
-Sunlight crasher!

152
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:41,879
Again?

153
00:09:41,912 --> 00:09:43,779
-Your attack is in vain.

154
00:09:43,812 --> 00:09:46,346
If the blade directly touches
even part of your weapon,

155
00:09:46,379 --> 00:09:48,579
not only will the
energy be absorbed,

156
00:09:48,612 --> 00:09:51,412
but the impact itself
that is generated even

157
00:09:51,446 --> 00:09:55,012
from that simple brush with your
Buso Renkin is also absorbed.

158
00:10:00,079 --> 00:10:02,146
Any and all energy
attacks become

159
00:10:02,179 --> 00:10:08,112
powerless against the
Sword Samurai X. It really

160
00:10:08,146 --> 00:10:12,146
seems as though you and
I are truly a good match.

161
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:13,979
-So in other words,
a head to head

162
00:10:14,012 --> 00:10:15,946
battle with just our
raw strength and skills.

163
00:10:15,979 --> 00:10:17,146
Is that it?

164
00:10:17,179 --> 00:10:18,412
-Exactly.

165
00:10:18,446 --> 00:10:21,046
A peer battle between
a sword and a spear.

166
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:22,012
-Let's go!

167
00:10:35,079 --> 00:10:36,312
-Get down.

168
00:10:36,346 --> 00:10:38,779
That spot is reserved for me.

169
00:10:38,812 --> 00:10:39,579
-Is that so?

170
00:10:39,612 --> 00:10:40,946
Well not tonight.

171
00:10:40,979 --> 00:10:42,979
It's the perfect
place from which

172
00:10:43,012 --> 00:10:46,112
I can shoot my arrows at you
and finally finish you off.

173
00:10:52,889 --> 00:10:54,155
-What?

174
00:10:54,189 --> 00:10:56,689
Did you say that Kazuki and
Tokiko haven't returned yet?

175
00:10:56,722 --> 00:10:59,789
-Yeah, we were with them
up until school let out.

176
00:10:59,822 --> 00:11:02,855
-What is Bravo doing
here at this hour?

177
00:11:02,889 --> 00:11:05,455
-Oh, no need to worry, Bravo.

178
00:11:05,489 --> 00:11:08,189
They do this all the time.

179
00:11:08,222 --> 00:11:10,655
Oh!

180
00:11:10,689 --> 00:11:12,622
Hey, an earthquake.

181
00:11:12,655 --> 00:11:13,622
Look, we're shaking.

182
00:11:13,655 --> 00:11:14,989
It's an earthquake.

183
00:11:15,022 --> 00:11:15,722
-Really?

184
00:11:15,755 --> 00:11:17,255
I don't feel it at all.

185
00:11:17,289 --> 00:11:19,689
-Why are you so excited
about that, Mahiro?

186
00:11:19,722 --> 00:11:21,122
-Earthquake bulletin.

187
00:11:21,155 --> 00:11:22,555
Watch.

188
00:11:22,589 --> 00:11:24,922
-I was fighting the
final boss just now!

189
00:11:24,955 --> 00:11:28,322
Just turn it back on,
please, turn it back on!

190
00:11:36,289 --> 00:11:42,422
[panting]

191
00:11:42,455 --> 00:11:45,122
-You should think a little
more before you attack.

192
00:11:45,155 --> 00:11:48,189
All you're doing is
making holes in the roof.

193
00:11:48,222 --> 00:11:49,722
-Oh, my.

194
00:11:49,755 --> 00:11:53,722
But please tell me,
who's going to report me?

195
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:56,989
Certainly not you,
since you'll be dead.

196
00:12:00,122 --> 00:12:02,255
-Buso Renkin archery.

197
00:12:02,289 --> 00:12:04,789
The special property
is precise, high speed

198
00:12:04,822 --> 00:12:07,522
shooting with that
stupid looking automaton.

199
00:12:07,555 --> 00:12:10,855
However, that doesn't
explain the gauntlet

200
00:12:10,889 --> 00:12:13,255
she's wearing on her right arm.

201
00:12:13,289 --> 00:12:16,789
She must have another
ability up their sleeve.

202
00:12:16,822 --> 00:12:19,189
-The death scythe Buso Renkin.

203
00:12:19,222 --> 00:12:21,589
Its special property is
precise high speed operation

204
00:12:21,622 --> 00:12:23,322
with a manipulator.

205
00:12:23,355 --> 00:12:25,655
That somewhat resembles
my Buso Renkin.

206
00:12:25,689 --> 00:12:28,689
Isn't that interesting?

207
00:12:28,722 --> 00:12:29,189
However.

208
00:12:33,789 --> 00:12:37,022
But it seems my Angel Gozen
here is slightly more superior,

209
00:12:37,055 --> 00:12:38,689
don't you agree?

210
00:12:38,722 --> 00:12:39,689
-[laughs]

211
00:12:39,722 --> 00:12:40,522
-Huh?

212
00:12:40,555 --> 00:12:41,222
-You know what?

213
00:12:41,255 --> 00:12:42,489
I've had it with you.

214
00:12:42,522 --> 00:12:45,622
I don't want to worry anymore
about taking you alive

215
00:12:45,655 --> 00:12:48,022
or cleaning up afterwards.

216
00:12:48,055 --> 00:12:52,189
So I'm just going to
splatter your guts.

217
00:12:52,222 --> 00:12:54,655
-What?

218
00:12:54,689 --> 00:12:56,355
Master Gozen, fire now.

219
00:13:04,889 --> 00:13:08,122
She's sacrificing her arms and
legs to protect her vitals.

220
00:13:08,155 --> 00:13:10,855
It's impossible to
shoot her down this way.

221
00:13:10,889 --> 00:13:12,222
Master Gozen, go now.

222
00:13:21,722 --> 00:13:22,489
-I missed.

223
00:13:22,522 --> 00:13:23,489
No.

224
00:13:23,522 --> 00:13:26,455
Something made me miss.

225
00:13:26,489 --> 00:13:28,789
Oh, come on you
stupid little doll.

226
00:13:28,822 --> 00:13:29,955
Get off me.

227
00:13:29,989 --> 00:13:32,855
Beat it.

228
00:13:32,889 --> 00:13:35,222
Her Buso has been deactivated.

229
00:13:35,255 --> 00:13:36,122
She's on the run.

230
00:13:40,089 --> 00:13:42,722
-I ambush and then I
escape and the end result

231
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:46,622
is me looking like this.

232
00:13:46,655 --> 00:13:50,122
How pathetic.

233
00:13:50,155 --> 00:13:57,755
But I don't care how much
I need to endure in order

234
00:13:57,789 --> 00:13:59,955
to make our dream come true.

235
00:13:59,989 --> 00:14:03,122
She's not an opponent
I can handle by myself.

236
00:14:03,155 --> 00:14:04,922
I can't take her down alone.

237
00:14:04,955 --> 00:14:06,789
I must meet up with
Shusui and regroup.

238
00:14:10,089 --> 00:14:11,655
I wonder how things
are going for him.

239
00:14:17,322 --> 00:14:18,922
-14 cuts.

240
00:14:18,955 --> 00:14:22,755
You lasted longer
than I thought.

241
00:14:22,789 --> 00:14:26,622
Kazuki, I'm grateful to you.

242
00:14:26,655 --> 00:14:29,955
The only reason I am
as strong as I am now

243
00:14:29,989 --> 00:14:31,622
is because of all the
training that I've

244
00:14:31,655 --> 00:14:33,455
done with you this week.

245
00:14:33,489 --> 00:14:37,155
Thanks to you I am as
strong as I possibly can be.

246
00:14:37,189 --> 00:14:39,289
And now thanks to
your death, I've

247
00:14:39,322 --> 00:14:41,589
arrived closer to
my greatest desire.

248
00:14:41,622 --> 00:14:44,055
It must be lonely
to die on your own.

249
00:14:44,089 --> 00:14:47,722
Be sure to wait a bit at the
entrance of the afterlife.

250
00:14:47,755 --> 00:14:49,555
I'll send along one more person.

251
00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:51,555
Tokiko Tsumura
will join you soon.

252
00:15:04,822 --> 00:15:06,789
-I'm not dead yet.

253
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:10,155
And I won't let Tokiko
die either, you hear me?

254
00:15:10,189 --> 00:15:12,055
-How can you still be alive?

255
00:15:12,089 --> 00:15:14,655
You've got fatal
wounds in 14 spots.

256
00:15:14,689 --> 00:15:16,522
-You're the only one, Shusui.

257
00:15:16,555 --> 00:15:18,822
I too got as strong
as I possibly

258
00:15:18,855 --> 00:15:21,089
could after this one
week of training.

259
00:15:21,122 --> 00:15:24,489
I suppose that's one thing
I'll have to thank you for.

260
00:15:24,522 --> 00:15:26,022
-He was able to dodge that.

261
00:15:26,055 --> 00:15:28,155
But my physical
ability and skills

262
00:15:28,189 --> 00:15:30,155
are still greater than his.

263
00:15:30,189 --> 00:15:34,022
He is definitely much
stronger than before though.

264
00:15:34,055 --> 00:15:35,855
Now that I think about it.

265
00:15:35,889 --> 00:15:37,389
Tell me something, Kazuki.

266
00:15:37,422 --> 00:15:39,089
Have you had some
other training?

267
00:15:39,122 --> 00:15:40,855
-I've been receiving
basic training

268
00:15:40,889 --> 00:15:43,122
as an alchemist
warrior every night.

269
00:15:43,155 --> 00:15:46,155
-So you've been training
twice as much as I have, huh?

270
00:15:46,189 --> 00:15:49,089
No wonder you've improved
as much as you have.

271
00:15:49,122 --> 00:15:52,755
-I'm the most inexperienced
warrior of my entire group,

272
00:15:52,789 --> 00:15:55,355
so I have to work the hardest.

273
00:15:55,389 --> 00:15:57,289
And that's what I'll do.

274
00:15:57,322 --> 00:16:00,122
What's that wish you
talked about earlier?

275
00:16:00,155 --> 00:16:02,755
You're wanting to get as
strong as you possibly could,

276
00:16:02,789 --> 00:16:06,222
for the sake of making
that wish come true?

277
00:16:06,255 --> 00:16:07,789
What the hell is
the wish that you

278
00:16:07,822 --> 00:16:11,289
want so badly that you'd
give up being human?

279
00:16:11,322 --> 00:16:14,189
-It's not my wish alone.

280
00:16:14,222 --> 00:16:15,255
It is also my sister's.

281
00:16:17,822 --> 00:16:20,922
If you really want to
know, I'll tell you.

282
00:16:20,955 --> 00:16:23,289
However--

283
00:16:23,322 --> 00:16:25,089
-His fighting spirit.

284
00:16:25,122 --> 00:16:27,855
It must be from--

285
00:16:27,889 --> 00:16:31,289
-Only if you can stop my
sword with your lance.

286
00:16:34,489 --> 00:16:37,389
-The Reverse Do!

287
00:16:37,422 --> 00:16:40,422
It's beyond my power to
dodge that kind of speed.

288
00:16:40,455 --> 00:16:44,155
And it's also possible to
block that kind of weight.

289
00:16:44,189 --> 00:16:46,755
It's Shusui's ultimate attack.

290
00:16:46,789 --> 00:16:48,822
Once he unleashes it--

291
00:16:48,855 --> 00:16:50,722
-You will die.

292
00:16:50,755 --> 00:16:53,389
I'm going to kill you.

293
00:16:53,422 --> 00:16:56,189
The attack will
be instantaneous.

294
00:16:56,222 --> 00:16:58,955
Close your eyes and
relax your arms and legs.

295
00:16:58,989 --> 00:17:02,922
If you do that, you won't
have to feel any pain or fear.

296
00:17:10,789 --> 00:17:13,489
-When you let me have
the first move earlier,

297
00:17:13,522 --> 00:17:15,489
you were acting according
to your own principles

298
00:17:15,522 --> 00:17:17,555
in order to ease
your own conscience.

299
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:19,522
But if you're willing
to give up your humanity

300
00:17:19,555 --> 00:17:22,155
for this desire of yours,
I should know what it is.

301
00:17:22,189 --> 00:17:24,755
I have the right to
know that much at least.

302
00:17:24,789 --> 00:17:28,822
-You should know that can't
dodge nor block my Reverse Do.

303
00:17:28,855 --> 00:17:30,589
The other option
is to take the hit

304
00:17:30,622 --> 00:17:32,755
and attempt to counter attack.

305
00:17:32,789 --> 00:17:35,389
Then you might be
able to take me out.

306
00:17:35,422 --> 00:17:39,822
But my Sword Samurai X can slice
through both flesh and bone

307
00:17:39,855 --> 00:17:42,655
at once, First I'll
take your life,

308
00:17:42,689 --> 00:17:45,089
and then I'll take your
kakugane at my leisure.

309
00:17:45,122 --> 00:17:48,322
-Unfortunately, my life and
kakugane are one in the same.

310
00:17:48,355 --> 00:17:50,489
Not even you will be
able to cut through that.

311
00:17:50,522 --> 00:17:51,489
And I'll prove it.

312
00:17:59,555 --> 00:18:01,655
-Kazuki.

313
00:18:01,689 --> 00:18:04,222
I've cut through his vitals.

314
00:18:04,255 --> 00:18:07,122
But what's this?

315
00:18:07,155 --> 00:18:09,889
-I deactivated my Buso Renkin.

316
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,855
You blocked my first
move with your kakugane.

317
00:18:12,889 --> 00:18:15,889
So now it's my turn to
do the same thing to you.

318
00:18:15,922 --> 00:18:20,622
This kakugane that I received
from Tokiko is a new life.

319
00:18:20,655 --> 00:18:24,955
And there's no way I'm going
to give it up just like that.

320
00:18:24,989 --> 00:18:25,689
Once again.

321
00:18:25,722 --> 00:18:26,189
Buso!

322
00:18:33,722 --> 00:18:34,189
-No!

323
00:18:38,055 --> 00:18:38,722
-Ouka.

324
00:18:38,755 --> 00:18:39,255
What are you?

325
00:18:42,722 --> 00:18:43,189
-Shusui.

326
00:18:53,955 --> 00:18:56,022
-What the?

327
00:18:56,055 --> 00:18:57,455
The wound is
transferring to Ouka.

328
00:19:00,455 --> 00:19:02,155
-Ouka.

329
00:19:02,189 --> 00:19:02,655
Stop it.

330
00:19:08,955 --> 00:19:10,655
No.

331
00:19:10,689 --> 00:19:15,455
-Her Buso Renkin
transfers injuries.

332
00:19:15,489 --> 00:19:15,955
-Ouka.

333
00:19:18,755 --> 00:19:19,222
-Shusui.

334
00:19:26,322 --> 00:19:29,122
-But a wound like that
should automatically

335
00:19:29,155 --> 00:19:32,622
heal in a Humunculus.

336
00:19:32,655 --> 00:19:34,722
Wounds in areas other
than the emblem mark

337
00:19:34,755 --> 00:19:36,589
should not be fatal.

338
00:19:36,622 --> 00:19:39,089
And yet, why?

339
00:19:39,122 --> 00:19:42,689
Could it be that these two
are flesh and blood humans?

340
00:19:42,722 --> 00:19:43,189
-Familiars.

341
00:19:45,855 --> 00:19:47,522
-Tokiko?

342
00:19:47,555 --> 00:19:48,489
-Your wounds.

343
00:19:48,522 --> 00:19:49,422
Are you OK?

344
00:19:49,455 --> 00:19:50,122
-They're hurting.

345
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:51,589
But I'll deal with it.

346
00:19:51,622 --> 00:19:54,622
What did you say they were?

347
00:19:54,655 --> 00:19:56,822
-I guess I didn't
tell you, did I?

348
00:19:56,855 --> 00:20:00,422
Familiars are human
beings who pledge loyalty

349
00:20:00,455 --> 00:20:03,189
to the Humunculi.

350
00:20:03,222 --> 00:20:05,989
No matter how superior
they are to humans,

351
00:20:06,022 --> 00:20:08,289
a Humunculus as
a single body has

352
00:20:08,322 --> 00:20:11,789
difficulty to survive
alone hidden in society.

353
00:20:11,822 --> 00:20:14,255
Each time they eat a
human it becomes easier

354
00:20:14,289 --> 00:20:16,855
to be spotted by an
alchemist warrior.

355
00:20:16,889 --> 00:20:18,322
And if they're
discovered, they're

356
00:20:18,355 --> 00:20:20,389
almost always terminated.

357
00:20:20,422 --> 00:20:24,355
Consequently, communities like
the L.X.E. Are usually formed.

358
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,655
And humans like these
two are incorporated

359
00:20:26,689 --> 00:20:29,255
at the bottom of that
social hierarchy.

360
00:20:29,289 --> 00:20:31,755
Those who have authority
and financial status

361
00:20:31,789 --> 00:20:35,855
supply that power and those with
nothing become manual labor.

362
00:20:42,422 --> 00:20:43,122
-The emblem.

363
00:20:43,155 --> 00:20:44,222
-Look closely.

364
00:20:44,255 --> 00:20:46,989
It's just fluorescent paint.

365
00:20:47,022 --> 00:20:49,089
Familiars paint an
emblem on themselves

366
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:53,055
as a form of prevention when
they work for the Humunculi.

367
00:20:53,089 --> 00:20:55,055
This is supposedly
done to prevent them

368
00:20:55,089 --> 00:20:57,389
from being devoured by mistake.

369
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,889
So this confirms everything.

370
00:20:59,922 --> 00:21:05,222
-Shusui, Ouka, why do this?

371
00:21:05,255 --> 00:21:07,622
-I promised that
I would tell you

372
00:21:07,655 --> 00:21:11,089
if you stopped my Reverse Do.

373
00:21:11,122 --> 00:21:13,155
We both share the same desire.

374
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:16,055
We want to become Humunculi
so that we can live together

375
00:21:16,089 --> 00:21:16,822
for all eternity.

376
00:21:19,855 --> 00:21:23,689
We both made our pledge
in sickness and health.

377
00:21:23,722 --> 00:21:28,122
-We pledged in joy
and also in sorrow.

378
00:21:28,155 --> 00:21:29,522
-For richer.

379
00:21:29,555 --> 00:21:31,189
-Or for poorer.

380
00:21:31,222 --> 00:21:33,689
-To love and respect.

381
00:21:33,722 --> 00:21:36,555
-To comfort and protect.

382
00:21:42,422 --> 00:21:44,922
-Til death do us part.

383
00:21:52,951 --> 00:21:56,984
[music playing]

384
00:23:23,984 --> 00:23:27,651
-That softness of yours will
cost you your life someday.

385
00:23:27,684 --> 00:23:30,351
Before that happens I will take
away your fighting strength

386
00:23:30,384 --> 00:23:32,951
and I'll put an end to
your life as a warrior.

387
00:23:32,984 --> 00:23:36,151
Next episode, Til
Death Do Us Part.

388
00:23:36,184 --> 00:23:39,684
I'll splatter your guts.
