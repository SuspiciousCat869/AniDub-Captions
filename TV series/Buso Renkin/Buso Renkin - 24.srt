NARRATOR: The supernatural
power by gathering

00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,933
the essence of alchemy
is the Kakugane.

3
00:00:18,966 --> 00:00:22,933
This device activates upon
a person's fighting instinct

4
00:00:22,966 --> 00:00:25,466
manifesting the
possessor's inner power

5
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,566
into a tangible form, creating
a weapon like no other.

6
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:35,033
It's name Buso Renkin.

[theme music]

8
00:02:12,704 --> 00:02:14,337
-What did you just say?

9
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:16,237
You can't really be serious.

10
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:17,637
-I am.

11
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:20,370
After thinking it through, this
is the decision I've come to.

12
00:02:20,404 --> 00:02:23,870
You and I and Tokiko
will have to bear with it

13
00:02:23,904 --> 00:02:27,904
for a little while, but if it
works, everyone will be saved.

14
00:02:27,937 --> 00:02:30,970
Please, give us a
hand, Chouno, and I

15
00:02:31,004 --> 00:02:33,004
promise you'll have
your showdown with me.

16
00:02:33,037 --> 00:02:36,737
You can choose the time and
the place, how we do it,

17
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:37,537
everything.

18
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:39,404
What do you say?

19
00:02:39,437 --> 00:02:40,537
TOKIKO (VOICEOVER): Kazuki.

20
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:46,170
-Let me think.

21
00:02:46,204 --> 00:02:47,970
It does sound like
I better option

22
00:02:48,004 --> 00:02:50,870
than the one I have
currently at hand.

23
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:53,104
Just don't mess things up.

24
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:16,004
-Buster Baron is still
engaged in battle with Victor.

25
00:03:16,037 --> 00:03:18,570
Other units continue their
way with attacks and support,

26
00:03:18,604 --> 00:03:20,970
but most of these squads
have been wiped out.

27
00:03:21,004 --> 00:03:22,870
Considering what
little available forces

28
00:03:22,904 --> 00:03:26,704
we have remaining, I'm afraid
the end of this decisive battle

29
00:03:26,737 --> 00:03:28,070
is near.

30
00:03:28,104 --> 00:03:31,504
Our only hope lies with great
Warrior Chief, Buster Baron.

31
00:03:31,537 --> 00:03:35,004
-And Kazuki Muto's
White Kakugane.

[cell phone ringing]

33
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:40,737
-Victor has begun to move.

34
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:42,637
He's rapidly approaching
Buster Baron.

35
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:44,370
A face off is imminent.

36
00:03:44,404 --> 00:03:46,470
-The time has finally arrived.

37
00:03:46,504 --> 00:03:49,770
-Yeah On this end as well.

38
00:03:49,804 --> 00:03:52,204
The White Kakugane is ready.

39
00:03:52,237 --> 00:03:52,704
Let's do it.

40
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,004
KAZUKI: Tokiko.

41
00:03:59,037 --> 00:04:00,237
-You're late.

42
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:02,570
We were supposed to everyone
here a long time ago.

43
00:04:02,604 --> 00:04:05,304
-Sorry, I was buying
some takoyaki.

44
00:04:05,337 --> 00:04:06,370
Where is everyone?

45
00:04:06,404 --> 00:04:07,970
-Their late as well.

46
00:04:08,004 --> 00:04:11,170
Everyone's enjoying the summer
festival a little bit too much.

47
00:04:11,204 --> 00:04:12,604
-Now, now.

48
00:04:12,637 --> 00:04:14,437
The festival's only once a year.

49
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:16,437
And there's still time
till the fireworks start.

50
00:04:19,137 --> 00:04:21,237
-You seem so relaxed, Kazuki.

51
00:04:24,837 --> 00:04:26,837
Summer's almost
over, and we still

52
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,504
have to settle the
matter with Victor

53
00:04:28,537 --> 00:04:33,937
and the White Kakugane,
yet, you're so relaxed.

54
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:36,737
-That's because of you, Tokiko.

55
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:38,504
-You gave me great
courage the other day.

56
00:04:49,904 --> 00:04:52,804
Are you a bit worried?

57
00:04:52,837 --> 00:04:56,904
-To be honest, a little,
but I have faith in you.

58
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:03,270
How you will use the White
Kakugane is still a mystery.

59
00:05:08,137 --> 00:05:10,804
-In that case,
shall I return a bit

60
00:05:10,837 --> 00:05:13,837
of the courage you
shared with me?

61
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:14,337
-Hm?

62
00:05:18,737 --> 00:05:19,737
TOKIKO (VOICEOVER): Idiot.

63
00:05:26,937 --> 00:05:27,404
-Aw.

64
00:05:32,304 --> 00:05:34,704
Oh my, that's why I felt
the atmosphere changed

65
00:05:34,737 --> 00:05:36,837
the moment since
you two got back.

66
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:37,770
Oh, it's OK.

67
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:39,137
Go on, don't let me interrupt.

68
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:40,070
-Well, in that case.

69
00:05:40,104 --> 00:05:41,470
-Like hell we will.

70
00:05:41,504 --> 00:05:42,770
Total misunderstanding.

71
00:05:42,804 --> 00:05:43,637
We were trying to--

72
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:44,737
-There's no need hide it.

73
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:46,804
Everyone is going to
be so happy about this.

74
00:05:46,837 --> 00:05:48,670
Congrats, you two.

75
00:05:48,704 --> 00:05:50,470
-Takes, Mahiro.

76
00:05:50,504 --> 00:05:51,470
-Yeah, thanks, Mahiro.

77
00:05:55,937 --> 00:05:56,870
-Tokiko!

78
00:05:56,904 --> 00:05:57,370
Kazuki!

79
00:06:03,204 --> 00:06:03,804
KAZUKI: Tokiko.

80
00:06:03,837 --> 00:06:05,770
-Yes, I know.

81
00:06:05,804 --> 00:06:08,737
-Another mission, so suddenly?

82
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:10,704
Well, I guess that's
just how it is.

83
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:14,670
You always fight to
protect everyone, right?

84
00:06:14,704 --> 00:06:17,137
-Mahiro, we need to--

85
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:17,970
-There's no time.

86
00:06:18,004 --> 00:06:20,670
Please, hurry.

87
00:06:20,704 --> 00:06:23,437
-Mahiro, this might
be a long goodbye, OK?

88
00:06:26,204 --> 00:06:31,070
But I'll be sure to
return, so don't worry.

89
00:06:31,104 --> 00:06:32,937
-K.

90
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:36,637
MAHIRO (VOICEOVER):
A long goodbye?

91
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:39,304
-Say goodbye to everyone for me.

92
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:45,670
-A helicopter?

93
00:06:45,704 --> 00:06:48,137
-Mappy, what was that just now?

94
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:51,337
-Don't tell me that
was Kazuki and Tokiko?

95
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,604
-Yes.

96
00:06:53,637 --> 00:06:59,870
And he said that this time it's
going to be longer than usual.

97
00:06:59,904 --> 00:07:02,404
But that we shouldn't
worry about it.

98
00:07:02,437 --> 00:07:04,370
-Oh, Mappy.

99
00:07:04,404 --> 00:07:06,837
-Poor Mahiro.

100
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:09,104
-I know that's
just the way it is.

101
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:12,604
My big brother is doing
this to protect everyone,

102
00:07:12,637 --> 00:07:17,604
but still, if he does
anything to make Tokiko cry,

103
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:19,070
I'll be mad at him.

104
00:07:19,104 --> 00:07:22,570
I'll be mad at him.

105
00:07:22,604 --> 00:07:24,070
-Kazuki?

106
00:07:24,104 --> 00:07:26,437
What did you mean
when you said that?

107
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:27,437
A long goodbye?

108
00:07:30,337 --> 00:07:33,237
-Hey, Muto, take a look
out the window, down below.

109
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,570
BRAVO (VOICEOVER): There
is nothing left for me

110
00:07:52,604 --> 00:07:55,270
to teach you as a Warrior Chief.

111
00:07:55,304 --> 00:07:58,070
I leave it all up to
you now, the choice

112
00:07:58,104 --> 00:08:01,137
that you have made,
Warrior Kazuki.

113
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:10,370
-The White Kakugane is ready.

114
00:08:10,404 --> 00:08:12,337
Push it into the
chest so that it

115
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:14,337
overlaps with the
embedded Black Kakugane.

116
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:19,137
It will then cancel out
the Black Kakugane's power.

117
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:22,504
Kazuki, have you decided
how you will use it?

118
00:08:22,537 --> 00:08:24,937
-Hm.

119
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:27,637
-Very well, then please take it.

120
00:08:35,804 --> 00:08:40,504
-All right, now everything's
ready on my end.

121
00:08:40,537 --> 00:08:53,070
-Kazuki, I'm truly sorry to have
involved you in such a mess.

122
00:08:53,104 --> 00:08:54,737
-Dr. Alexandria!

123
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:56,104
GOTA (VOICEOVER):
Her brain cells

124
00:08:56,137 --> 00:08:57,770
have reached their limits.

125
00:08:57,804 --> 00:09:00,070
Even though it's been
cloned, the original

126
00:09:00,104 --> 00:09:01,970
is well over 100 years old.

127
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:06,804
-You got what you came for.

128
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:10,104
Now, just get out of our sight.

129
00:09:10,137 --> 00:09:13,070
-There is still
time left before you

130
00:09:13,104 --> 00:09:17,004
reach the battlefield,
so please,

131
00:09:17,037 --> 00:09:19,970
think it over one last time.

132
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,837
-Oh, he did it.

133
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:33,337
-No.

134
00:09:41,304 --> 00:09:44,437
His regenerative powers are
similar to your Gekisen.

135
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:46,770
-You're right, but there is
an overwhelming difference.

136
00:09:46,804 --> 00:09:49,104
It's in the amount
of energy used.

137
00:09:49,137 --> 00:09:50,904
Just where is that
energy coming from?

138
00:09:50,937 --> 00:09:52,604
SHOSEI (VOICEOVER):
He is draining energy

139
00:09:52,637 --> 00:09:53,870
from the ocean life.

140
00:09:53,904 --> 00:09:56,204
Every single organism in it.

141
00:09:56,237 --> 00:09:59,537
The energy available at
Victor's disposal on this planet

142
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:00,604
is now limitless.

143
00:10:06,204 --> 00:10:07,637
-He's huge.

144
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:09,170
-Warrior Chief.

145
00:10:09,204 --> 00:10:11,204
-Buster Baron, right arm on.

146
00:10:11,237 --> 00:10:15,970
-Buso Renkin of katana
sword, sword samurai axe.

147
00:10:16,004 --> 00:10:16,904
-Huh?

148
00:10:16,937 --> 00:10:18,437
-A different type
of Buso Renkin.

149
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:20,870
-Came out of Buster Baron's arm.

150
00:10:20,904 --> 00:10:22,837
-Nothing to be surprised about.

151
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:24,670
That is Buster Baron's
special property.

152
00:10:24,704 --> 00:10:27,670
It scans and materializes
the Buso Renkin

153
00:10:27,704 --> 00:10:29,937
of the warrior boarded
inside it's sub-cockpit

154
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:32,770
and then it enhances
everything from it's form

155
00:10:32,804 --> 00:10:34,670
to it's special property.

156
00:10:34,704 --> 00:10:37,837
The original plan was to
use Sakimori's silver skin

157
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:38,970
in there.

158
00:10:39,004 --> 00:10:40,670
Still--

159
00:10:40,704 --> 00:10:45,070
-You have an excellent Buso
Renkin, Warrior Shusui.

160
00:10:45,104 --> 00:10:47,537
-I am deeply honored, sir.

161
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:50,637
I shall scatter away
all energy attacks

162
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,570
as though they were mist.

163
00:10:52,604 --> 00:10:54,637
-All right, attack now.

164
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:56,437
-Come on, let's go, you apes.

165
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:57,437
It's our turn.

166
00:10:57,470 --> 00:11:00,637
-Yes, sir!

167
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:02,737
-Here come killer rabies.

168
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:04,370
-It's time for my secret trail.

169
00:11:04,404 --> 00:11:05,504
-Bubble cage.

170
00:11:05,537 --> 00:11:06,004
-Gekisen.

171
00:11:12,304 --> 00:11:13,270
-Eat this.

172
00:11:13,304 --> 00:11:15,570
10,000 degree flame!

173
00:11:15,604 --> 00:11:17,037
Blaze of glory.

174
00:11:22,404 --> 00:11:22,870
-Ah!

175
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:32,237
-Local guard, set.

176
00:11:35,537 --> 00:11:38,504
Demon alchemy, return to dust.

177
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:55,437
And with this, it all
finally comes to an end.

178
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:57,237
-You're wrong.

179
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:58,870
It all ends for you.

180
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:07,104
-Wait a sec, that's
the real Victor?

181
00:12:07,137 --> 00:12:09,470
So what was that giant
we've been fighting with.

182
00:12:09,504 --> 00:12:11,770
-A shadow created with the
remains of the sea life

183
00:12:11,804 --> 00:12:13,870
he destroyed using
the energy drain.

184
00:12:13,904 --> 00:12:15,970
-Buso Renkin of Great Axe.

185
00:12:16,004 --> 00:12:18,004
-All units, evacuate!

186
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:18,970
-Fatal Attraction.

187
00:12:34,065 --> 00:12:35,431
-We should be arriving shortly.

188
00:12:35,465 --> 00:12:39,498
Please be ready to take
action at a moments notice.

189
00:12:39,531 --> 00:12:41,498
-What took you so long?

190
00:12:41,531 --> 00:12:44,865
I was getting tired of waiting.

191
00:12:44,898 --> 00:12:46,298
-Papillon.

192
00:12:46,331 --> 00:12:49,531
-Well, it is ready
for you, Muto.

193
00:12:49,565 --> 00:12:52,698
At least one of the two items
that you requested, that is.

194
00:12:59,298 --> 00:13:01,798
-Great, thank you, Chouno.

195
00:13:01,831 --> 00:13:05,098
With this, everything should
be ready for me to get started.

196
00:13:05,131 --> 00:13:06,865
-What do you mean, Kazuki?

197
00:13:06,898 --> 00:13:08,931
Are you suggesting
that maybe there's

198
00:13:08,965 --> 00:13:12,131
another option aside from
sacrificing you or Victor?

199
00:13:12,165 --> 00:13:14,598
-No, there isn't, but
I'm about to create one.

200
00:13:14,631 --> 00:13:18,165
First, this White Kakugane, I'll
use it to restore Victor back

201
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:22,565
to his human form and put
an end to his rampage.

202
00:13:22,598 --> 00:13:24,398
-Then what will happen to you?

203
00:13:24,431 --> 00:13:27,565
-That is where this new type
of flack requested by Muto

204
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:30,631
and built by yours truly
will come into play.

205
00:13:30,665 --> 00:13:33,665
This will allow us to place
Muto in a suspended state

206
00:13:33,698 --> 00:13:35,731
and temporarily stop
his Victor process

207
00:13:35,765 --> 00:13:36,865
from advancing any further.

208
00:13:40,098 --> 00:13:43,131
That shall buy me enough time
to create a White Kakugane

209
00:13:43,165 --> 00:13:46,531
for Muto, so that he can be
restored to his human state

210
00:13:46,565 --> 00:13:47,865
again.

211
00:13:47,898 --> 00:13:51,565
And once and for all, he'll
have his showdown with me.

212
00:13:51,598 --> 00:13:53,831
You can't forget
your promise to me.

213
00:13:53,865 --> 00:13:55,798
-I gave you my word.

214
00:13:55,831 --> 00:13:58,865
Wake me up quick,
so I won't forget.

215
00:13:58,898 --> 00:14:01,498
Gota, please look after Tokiko.

216
00:14:01,531 --> 00:14:02,598
I'm counting on you.

217
00:14:07,198 --> 00:14:10,865
-You have my word on it, and
not as arrival for her love,

218
00:14:10,898 --> 00:14:12,031
but as an ally.

219
00:14:12,065 --> 00:14:13,798
I will look after her.

220
00:14:13,831 --> 00:14:16,665
You just go fight and then
go into your sleep stage,

221
00:14:16,698 --> 00:14:18,631
and come back in one piece.

222
00:14:18,665 --> 00:14:21,565
You got that?

223
00:14:21,598 --> 00:14:22,065
-Yes.

224
00:14:25,065 --> 00:14:26,531
Tokiko.

225
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:30,465
TOKIKO (VOICEOVER): It is
sort of a long goodbye,

226
00:14:30,498 --> 00:14:32,465
but it's not forever.

227
00:14:35,465 --> 00:14:36,765
I understand.

228
00:14:36,798 --> 00:14:39,265
But first, we have to make
sure that implanting the White

229
00:14:39,298 --> 00:14:42,765
Kakugane into
Victor is a success.

230
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:46,931
I will not allow this
farewell to be forever.

231
00:14:46,965 --> 00:14:51,231
-Kazuki, when you make that
strike, I will do it with you.

232
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:52,198
-Victor is in sight.

233
00:14:52,231 --> 00:14:53,931
We will be arriving
in one minute.

234
00:15:05,531 --> 00:15:07,731
-All of the responsibility
for this operation

235
00:15:07,765 --> 00:15:09,965
rests on my shoulders.

236
00:15:09,998 --> 00:15:12,731
Listen, everyone, I will
try to hold him off here.

237
00:15:12,765 --> 00:15:15,665
The rest of you retreat
as far as you can now.

238
00:15:15,698 --> 00:15:17,665
-I won't allow it.

239
00:15:17,698 --> 00:15:20,631
All things related
to alchemy shall

240
00:15:20,665 --> 00:15:23,598
be wiped from the
face of the earth.

241
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:29,331
Alchemy, the Kakugane,
Homunculi, and the Buso Renkin,

242
00:15:29,365 --> 00:15:32,265
I shall never forgive
what they've done to us.

243
00:15:57,398 --> 00:16:02,198
Blaming a young child for our
sins and making her a monster,

244
00:16:02,231 --> 00:16:04,565
manipulating her to turn
against their own father, who

245
00:16:04,598 --> 00:16:06,131
you people also
turned into a monster.

246
00:16:10,231 --> 00:16:13,431
From that moment on, I vowed
to annihilate everything

247
00:16:13,465 --> 00:16:16,331
related to alchemy but I failed.

248
00:16:16,365 --> 00:16:20,231
100 years later, I awake to
find that the very same mistakes

249
00:16:20,265 --> 00:16:23,265
of my time are being
repeated today.

250
00:16:23,298 --> 00:16:24,731
-But it's different with him.

251
00:16:24,765 --> 00:16:26,331
His case was an accident.

252
00:16:26,365 --> 00:16:27,798
-What has become of that boy?

253
00:16:27,831 --> 00:16:30,598
Tell me, what are
you doing right now?

254
00:16:30,631 --> 00:16:32,231
Aren't you trying
to re-exterminate

255
00:16:32,265 --> 00:16:34,098
him just like you're
doing with me?

256
00:16:34,131 --> 00:16:37,631
Re-extermination is
what you people do.

257
00:16:37,665 --> 00:16:38,698
Rage and anger.

258
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:41,498
Rage is all I have left.

259
00:16:41,531 --> 00:16:42,998
-Hey, is everyone all right?

260
00:16:43,031 --> 00:16:43,465
-Huh?

261
00:16:43,498 --> 00:16:44,498
A new enemy?

262
00:16:52,465 --> 00:16:54,398
-Don't let go of my hand.

263
00:16:54,431 --> 00:16:55,531
-I won't.

264
00:16:55,565 --> 00:16:57,731
Haven't you heard what
I've been telling you?

265
00:16:57,765 --> 00:17:01,865
Didn't I say it enough?

266
00:17:01,898 --> 00:17:05,531
-You and I are one.

267
00:17:05,565 --> 00:17:06,831
-You!

268
00:17:06,865 --> 00:17:09,931
-Near-death happiness.

269
00:17:09,965 --> 00:17:11,931
-Move, you're in the way.

270
00:17:11,965 --> 00:17:13,898
-Motor gears.

271
00:17:13,931 --> 00:17:16,365
-Pierce through our Buso Renkin.

272
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:30,565
-Looks like his energy--

273
00:17:30,598 --> 00:17:31,898
-Is being released.

274
00:17:31,931 --> 00:17:33,365
-Ah!

275
00:17:33,398 --> 00:17:36,265
-Victor is being restored
back to a human being.

276
00:17:43,065 --> 00:17:43,998
-It failed!

277
00:17:44,031 --> 00:17:45,965
-Wait!

278
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:48,431
His skin is returning to
it's original olive tone.

279
00:17:48,465 --> 00:17:50,798
The White Kakugane is
definitely working.

280
00:17:54,931 --> 00:17:58,365
-I'm afraid it's power is
not enough to offset my Black

281
00:17:58,398 --> 00:18:02,365
Kakugane now that I've
entered my third stage.

282
00:18:02,398 --> 00:18:04,565
Listen, boy, just
like me, you've

283
00:18:04,598 --> 00:18:06,831
been hunted down by
the Alchemist Army

284
00:18:06,865 --> 00:18:09,831
and almost killed by
those closest to you.

285
00:18:09,865 --> 00:18:13,165
But if still intend to fight
me in spite of all of that,

286
00:18:13,198 --> 00:18:15,065
then be my guest.

287
00:18:15,098 --> 00:18:16,831
-Kazuki, get ready.

288
00:18:16,865 --> 00:18:17,831
Don't let go.

289
00:18:17,865 --> 00:18:20,165
You and I are one.

290
00:18:20,198 --> 00:18:22,931
Remember, when you die,
I will die with you.

291
00:18:25,665 --> 00:18:28,065
-I'm sorry.

292
00:18:28,098 --> 00:18:30,265
I'm really sorry, Tokiko.

293
00:18:30,298 --> 00:18:31,965
I cannot keep that promise.

294
00:18:42,331 --> 00:18:46,092
I really am truly sorry.

295
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,587
-Kazuki!

296
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:53,053
NARRATOR: Muto, no!

297
00:18:53,087 --> 00:18:53,987
-Kazuki Muto!

298
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:04,320
-Energy full blast!

299
00:19:04,353 --> 00:19:07,087
-My dear Victoria.

300
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,153
-Yes, Mama?

301
00:19:09,187 --> 00:19:11,620
-If you should ever
meet your Papa,

302
00:19:11,653 --> 00:19:17,920
tell him-- tell him that I
loved him till the very end.

303
00:19:23,053 --> 00:19:27,220
-Hm, but Mama, if you happen to
be the one to meet Papa first,

304
00:19:27,253 --> 00:19:30,187
please tell him this for me.

305
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:35,153
That I can live on and survive
even if I am all alone.

306
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,720
BRAVO (VOICEOVER): Kazuki.

307
00:19:55,753 --> 00:19:56,553
-Kazuki.

308
00:19:56,587 --> 00:19:57,953
-Kazuki.

309
00:19:57,987 --> 00:19:59,887
-That man.

310
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,753
-That boy.

311
00:20:00,787 --> 00:20:02,087
-Thank guy.

312
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,887
-Kazuki Muto.

313
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,253
-Mr. Muto.

314
00:20:06,287 --> 00:20:08,553
-The Warrior Muto.

315
00:20:08,587 --> 00:20:09,953
-Kazuki Muto.

316
00:20:09,987 --> 00:20:11,253
-Kazuki.

317
00:20:11,287 --> 00:20:12,687
-Kazuki.

318
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,520
-Kazuki.

319
00:20:14,553 --> 00:20:15,320
-Kazuki.

320
00:20:15,353 --> 00:20:16,787
-Kazuki.

321
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:17,920
-Kazuki.

322
00:20:17,953 --> 00:20:18,420
-Kazuki.

323
00:20:25,887 --> 00:20:26,653
-Big brother.

324
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,120
-I'm impressed.

325
00:20:40,153 --> 00:20:41,853
On the lifeless
surface of the moon,

326
00:20:41,887 --> 00:20:43,820
the energy drain is useless.

327
00:20:43,853 --> 00:20:46,653
That was a very good strategy.

328
00:20:46,687 --> 00:20:50,087
Now, it's a match of
pure strength and skills.

329
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,987
However, whether
you win or lose,

330
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:55,453
you will no longer be
able to return alive.

331
00:21:00,053 --> 00:21:04,820
This determination of yours,
where does it come from?

332
00:21:04,853 --> 00:21:05,620
-Where else?

333
00:21:08,387 --> 00:21:09,787
It comes from that planet.

334
00:21:12,553 --> 00:21:20,320
You see, back there, there are
many people I want to protect,

335
00:21:20,353 --> 00:21:23,820
including the most
important person in my life.

336
00:21:27,587 --> 00:21:31,820
Ever since-- ever
since that one day,

337
00:21:31,853 --> 00:21:35,453
up until this very moment, even
though so much has happened,

338
00:21:35,487 --> 00:21:39,420
all I can remember now
are the good times we had.

339
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:54,353
TOKIKO (VOICEOVER):
Kazuki Kazuki.

340
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,653
-You idiot!

341
00:22:00,687 --> 00:22:03,053
I'll never forgive you, Muto.

342
00:22:03,087 --> 00:22:06,453
How dare you make
Tokiko suffer like this.

343
00:22:06,487 --> 00:22:12,853
-So now, there is no one left
who knows who I really am,

344
00:22:12,887 --> 00:22:16,320
and who would call
me by my name.

345
00:22:16,353 --> 00:22:16,787
-Kazuki.

346
00:22:24,047 --> 00:22:27,547
[theme music]

347
00:23:54,257 --> 00:23:57,324
TOKIKO: What could be left
for me on this planet?

348
00:23:57,357 --> 00:24:00,657
On this planet, where
you are no longer exist?

349
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:04,790
But this is the world
you risked your life for.

350
00:24:04,824 --> 00:24:08,324
Next time, no one could
ever take his place.
