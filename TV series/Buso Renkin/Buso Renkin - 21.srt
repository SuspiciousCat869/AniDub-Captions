NARRATOR: Kazuki, also
known as Victor Three,

12
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,637
faced off against
Captain Bravo, who

13
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:16,637
had come with a specific
mission, to re-exterminate him.

00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:20,603
Both men engaged
in a fierce battle.

00:02:20,637 --> 00:02:24,103
And even though Tokiko and
Gouta came to Kazuki's aid,

16
00:02:24,137 --> 00:02:28,570
Kazuki insisted on continuing
to fight his own way.

17

In the end, Kazuki
was victorious,

all hope for the future to him.

00:10:04,111 --> 00:10:04,644
-Really?

167
00:10:04,678 --> 00:10:06,078
That's great.

168
00:10:06,111 --> 00:10:08,211
-However, even
after he recovers,

169
00:10:08,244 --> 00:10:10,178
he won't be able
to fight as he had.

170
00:10:10,211 --> 00:10:12,778
-That Sakimori was
just so damn reckless.

171
00:10:12,811 --> 00:10:13,778
-Why, you--

172
00:10:13,811 --> 00:10:14,778
-You want a piece of me?

173
00:10:14,811 --> 00:10:15,778
SAKAGUCHI: Cut it out.

174
00:10:15,811 --> 00:10:17,678
-Come on, Shosei,
just let me at him.

175
00:10:17,711 --> 00:10:19,344
-Although it's nice
of you to address me

176
00:10:19,378 --> 00:10:21,344
in such a friendly
manner, please

177
00:10:21,378 --> 00:10:23,744
call me Great Warrior Chief
in front of subordinates.

178
00:10:26,311 --> 00:10:27,311
Unbelievable.

179
00:10:27,344 --> 00:10:28,411
Really.

180
00:10:28,444 --> 00:10:29,611
After seven years, I
thought you both would

181
00:10:29,644 --> 00:10:31,011
have grown up by now.

182
00:10:31,044 --> 00:10:34,744
I left you in charge of things,
thinking you could handle it.

183
00:10:34,778 --> 00:10:37,411
-If I'm in charge, why
do you show up, then?

184
00:10:37,444 --> 00:10:39,078
Seniors should just
retire somewhere,

185
00:10:39,111 --> 00:10:41,778
sipping tea with
their feet-- argh!

186
00:10:41,811 --> 00:10:44,778
[thumping sounds and laughter]

187
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:45,611
-Uh, excuse me.

188
00:10:45,644 --> 00:10:46,378
-Hmm?

189
00:10:46,411 --> 00:10:47,911
-Can I ask you something?

190
00:10:47,944 --> 00:10:50,344
-Sure, go ahead.

191
00:10:50,378 --> 00:10:53,911
-Why did you, the Great Warrior
Chief himself, come here?

192
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:56,611
-By any chance, has something
unexpected happened?

193
00:10:56,644 --> 00:10:57,911
-Yes.

194
00:10:57,944 --> 00:11:00,011
Victor was located
again last night.

195
00:11:00,044 --> 00:11:01,311
-Oh.

196
00:11:01,344 --> 00:11:03,444
-We're currently in pursuit
across the Pacific Ocean,

197
00:11:03,478 --> 00:11:06,144
a possible location
for our final battle.

198
00:11:11,444 --> 00:11:13,444
-Frequency from Victor
One has been detected.

199
00:11:13,478 --> 00:11:15,411
The gain is stable, Captain.

200
00:11:15,444 --> 00:11:16,511
It's all clear.

201
00:11:16,544 --> 00:11:18,378
-Enlarge to the main monitor.

202
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:19,044
SAILOR: Aye-aye.

203
00:11:28,244 --> 00:11:30,711
-This vessel shall
continue its main vigilance

204
00:11:30,744 --> 00:11:32,978
and keep a close
eye on Victor One.

205
00:11:33,011 --> 00:11:33,811
-Aye-aye, sir.

206
00:11:33,844 --> 00:11:34,311
-Aye-aye.

207
00:11:40,611 --> 00:11:43,844
-And so we've been trying to
summon all available warriors.

208
00:11:43,878 --> 00:11:46,144
But when we weren't able
to contact our key people

209
00:11:46,178 --> 00:11:49,344
like Sakimori and the others,
I had a feeling something

210
00:11:49,378 --> 00:11:50,311
was wrong.

211
00:11:50,344 --> 00:11:52,378
Then I come down
here and I see what

212
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:55,111
I feared most, our
key player, Sakimori,

213
00:11:55,144 --> 00:11:56,878
not being able to fight.

214
00:11:56,911 --> 00:11:58,911
It's a setback, but
we must not miss

215
00:11:58,944 --> 00:12:01,578
this chance for
our final battle.

216
00:12:01,611 --> 00:12:02,644
-Final battle?

217
00:12:02,678 --> 00:12:04,078
SAKAGUCHI: All other
missions are officially

218
00:12:04,111 --> 00:12:05,878
suspended from this moment on.

219
00:12:05,911 --> 00:12:07,244
-Oh.

220
00:12:07,278 --> 00:12:10,578
-From now on, this showdown
with Victor is our top priority.

221
00:12:10,611 --> 00:12:12,078
-What do you mean, "suspended"?

222
00:12:12,111 --> 00:12:13,378
-Do you object?

223
00:12:13,411 --> 00:12:14,778
-Damn right I do.

224
00:12:14,811 --> 00:12:16,778
Given the fact that my target's
standing right in front of me

225
00:12:16,811 --> 00:12:18,944
with a dumb look on his
face, it shouldn't take long

226
00:12:18,978 --> 00:12:20,844
to finish him off
and then move on.

227
00:12:20,878 --> 00:12:21,844
-Go ahead and try.

228
00:12:21,878 --> 00:12:23,178
I'm ready.

229
00:12:23,211 --> 00:12:25,944
Just staring at your ugly face
annoys the hell out of me.

230
00:12:25,978 --> 00:12:27,144
-Bring it on.

231
00:12:27,178 --> 00:12:29,311
-You'll taste the pain
Bravo went through.

232
00:12:29,344 --> 00:12:30,111
-Kazuki, don't.

233
00:12:30,144 --> 00:12:31,744
-Come on, let's go.

234
00:12:31,778 --> 00:12:33,444
-Right where we left off.

235
00:12:33,478 --> 00:12:35,578
[grunting]

236
00:12:35,611 --> 00:12:38,678
-I said missions were suspended.

237
00:12:38,711 --> 00:12:39,644
[shriek]

238
00:12:39,678 --> 00:12:40,578
[thump]

239
00:12:43,478 --> 00:12:44,878
-Kazuki, look out!

240
00:12:44,911 --> 00:12:47,711
-That's got to hurt.

241
00:12:47,744 --> 00:12:51,078
-That is what happens when
you don't follow my orders.

242
00:12:51,111 --> 00:12:52,644
Please don't forget it.

243
00:12:52,678 --> 00:12:53,811
-I won't, sir.

244
00:12:53,844 --> 00:12:57,078
SAKAGUCHI: Now then,
Victor Three, Kazuki Muto.

245
00:12:57,111 --> 00:12:59,444
Due to these circumstances,
your re-extermination

246
00:12:59,478 --> 00:13:01,511
shall be temporarily suspended.

247
00:13:01,544 --> 00:13:03,811
However, that doesn't
mean I can just leave you

248
00:13:03,844 --> 00:13:05,678
on the loose like
nothing's happened.

249
00:13:05,711 --> 00:13:10,211
So therefore warriors Tokiko and
Gouta, I order you both to keep

250
00:13:10,244 --> 00:13:12,111
watch over Kazuki Muto.

251
00:13:12,144 --> 00:13:12,978
-Huh?

252
00:13:13,011 --> 00:13:13,978
-Hey, wait a minute.

253
00:13:14,011 --> 00:13:15,211
Shosei--

254
00:13:15,244 --> 00:13:18,644
-The two of them are not
considered traitors anymore.

255
00:13:18,678 --> 00:13:19,844
-Did you hear that, guys?

256
00:13:19,878 --> 00:13:21,578
Isn't that great news, Gouta?

257
00:13:21,611 --> 00:13:23,844
Don't you think that's
wonderful, Tokiko?

258
00:13:23,878 --> 00:13:24,844
-I guess.

259
00:13:24,878 --> 00:13:26,644
However, that doesn't
change the fact

260
00:13:26,678 --> 00:13:28,411
that you're still in
a difficult position.

261
00:13:28,444 --> 00:13:31,044
-I'm OK with that.

262
00:13:31,078 --> 00:13:33,011
[giggling]

263
00:13:33,044 --> 00:13:34,478
[chopper blades approaching]

264
00:13:34,511 --> 00:13:35,478
-Huh?

265
00:13:35,511 --> 00:13:36,944
-The medical team is here.

266
00:13:50,633 --> 00:13:52,000
KAZUKI: Great Warrior Chief.

267
00:13:52,033 --> 00:13:52,566
-Hmm?

268
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,466
Yes, what is it?

269
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,266
-Don't take this the
wrong way, but please

270
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,433
take good care of Bravo.

271
00:13:58,466 --> 00:14:02,433
-There's no need for you,
an enemy, to ask me that.

272
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:06,566
Instead, use what is left
of your life, which Sakimori

273
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,900
risked himself to protect,
in a meaningful way.

274
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,833
[chopper engine starting]

275
00:14:22,733 --> 00:14:24,566
HIWATARI: Hey, Shosei.

276
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,000
Aren't you being a little soft?

277
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:29,533
-I can't take amateurs who
are unable to obey orders

278
00:14:29,566 --> 00:14:31,866
to such an important
and decisive battle.

279
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,366
-But still--

280
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,800
-We may be shorthanded.

281
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:36,733
But as far as our
human resources go,

282
00:14:36,766 --> 00:14:40,233
we must utilize the right
people in the right places.

283
00:14:40,266 --> 00:14:42,466
-Sakimori's your
favorite, so I understand

284
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,700
you want him to take his
feelings into consideration.

285
00:14:44,733 --> 00:14:45,833
But honestly--

286
00:14:45,866 --> 00:14:47,833
-Are you trying to say
that you don't agree?

287
00:14:47,866 --> 00:14:49,166
-No.

288
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,700
But we do live in an absurd
world with unusual choices,

289
00:14:51,733 --> 00:14:56,100
so I guess we just have to roll
with the punches and improvise.

290
00:14:56,133 --> 00:14:59,233
-You really have grown up quite
a bit, haven't you, Hiwatari?

291
00:14:59,266 --> 00:15:00,633
-Pfft.

292
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:03,166
-But you are aware of the
fact the word "absurd"

293
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,200
only began to come
out of your mouth

294
00:15:05,233 --> 00:15:07,133
and become a part
of your vocabulary

295
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:09,933
after that one rainy
day seven years ago?

296
00:15:09,966 --> 00:15:10,433
-Uh.

297
00:15:14,133 --> 00:15:17,533
-It seems Sakimori isn't the
only one who hasn't let go,

298
00:15:17,566 --> 00:15:18,033
doesn't it?

299
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,866
-There's one survivor,
this young girl here.

300
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:30,900
She's extremely weak.

301
00:15:30,933 --> 00:15:32,600
I don't think she'll
be able to hold out

302
00:15:32,633 --> 00:15:34,933
until a civilian
rescue gets here.

303
00:15:34,966 --> 00:15:36,433
I don't want to let her die.

304
00:15:41,366 --> 00:15:42,700
-Very well.

305
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:46,466
She will be under the army's
protection for the time being.

306
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,033
We're pulling out.

307
00:15:49,066 --> 00:15:50,966
Let's go, Hiwatari.

308
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,266
[sobbing quietly]

309
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,100
SAKAGUCHI: Hiwatari?

310
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,166
Oh, yes.

311
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,400
And for the record, each and
every one of my subordinates

312
00:16:01,433 --> 00:16:02,733
are favorites of mine.

313
00:16:02,766 --> 00:16:03,700
[sigh]

314
00:16:42,366 --> 00:16:43,466
VICTOR: Alchemist Warriors.

315
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:58,933
-It appears Victor has
pinpointed our vessel.

316
00:16:58,966 --> 00:17:00,000
He's approaching!

317
00:17:00,033 --> 00:17:01,800
-Submerge quickly.

318
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:02,566
-Aye-aye, sir.

319
00:17:12,966 --> 00:17:15,966
SAILOR: Victor is
pursuing us underwater.

320
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,900
-All crew, prepare for battle.

321
00:17:17,933 --> 00:17:18,466
-Captain!

322
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,800
-But Captain--

323
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:23,000
-I'm well aware that the army
underestimates our power.

324
00:17:23,033 --> 00:17:24,766
But no matter how
formidable Victor

325
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:29,300
may be, if we're in the water,
this submarine's Buso Renkin,

00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:30,966
the Deep Breathing, can win.

327
00:17:41,866 --> 00:17:44,066
Send a wire to the
army headquarters.

328
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,833
We will engage Victor.

329
00:17:45,866 --> 00:17:46,400
-Aye-aye.

330
00:17:46,433 --> 00:17:48,066
-Load torpedoes.

331
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,966
CAPTAIN: Line up the bearing.

332
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,933
Now fire!

333
00:17:50,966 --> 00:17:51,433
-Firing.

334
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,633
SAILOR: All shots successful.

335
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:02,166
-Confirm the target's been hit.

-Uh.

338
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:13,166
-Hmm.

339
00:18:16,466 --> 00:18:18,300
SAILOR: Target is unharmed!

340
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:19,633
-Reload all torpedoes.

341
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:20,966
-But hold on, sir.

342
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,700
Look over there.

343
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:22,533
What is that?

344
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,833
-Is that a ghost ship?

345
00:18:32,866 --> 00:18:34,500
-It looks like Victor's
controlling it.

346
00:18:38,066 --> 00:18:39,566
CAPTAIN: Have no fear.

347
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,166
Deep Breathing,
full speed ahead.

348
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,166
Get ready for a deep impact.

349
00:18:52,933 --> 00:18:53,900
-Oof!

350
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:55,366
CAPTAIN: Damage report!

351
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,066
-The vessel-- hasn't
been damaged at all.

352
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,866
-It can't be.

353
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:02,866
Gah!

354
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:03,433
-Oof!

355
00:19:03,466 --> 00:19:04,566
Hey, Captain!

356
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,333
We've lost control
of the vessel.

357
00:19:06,366 --> 00:19:09,300
Something-- some kind of
mysterious power is at work.

358
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:23,100
-All Alchemist Warriors
will be destroyed.

359

[laughter]

360
00:19:32,533 --> 00:19:34,633
CAPTAIN: Did you think this
Deep Breathing was just

361
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:36,633
an ordinary Buso Renkin?

362
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:37,133
Change!

363
00:19:39,966 --> 00:19:42,500
We can utilize our
three Kakugane together

364
00:19:42,533 --> 00:19:44,933
to create one
powerful Buso Renkin.

365
00:19:44,966 --> 00:19:46,733
-That combination is
the three Kakugane

366
00:19:46,766 --> 00:19:48,433
into six transformations.

367

-Let's take the sea
aerial battle form.

368
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:51,300
Formation!

369

-Battle confirmation.

370

-Enemy ship right in front, sir.

371
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:03,666
-Approaching.

372
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,633
-Advance!

373
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:06,833
Activate drill.

374
00:20:06,866 --> 00:20:07,633
SAILOR: Activating.

375
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,066
-Sir, it worked.

376
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:17,733
-Well done.

377
00:20:17,766 --> 00:20:18,266
-What?

378
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,066
Where's Victor?

-All Alchemist
Warriors must die!

382
00:20:38,466 --> 00:20:40,333
CAPTAIN: Send a wire to
the army headquarters.

383
00:20:40,366 --> 00:20:43,633
We could not defeat Victor,
and we will retreat.

-Aye-aye, Captain.

385
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,900
-That's very
unfortunate, Captain.

386
00:20:46,933 --> 00:20:48,200
-Yes, it is.

387
00:20:48,233 --> 00:20:50,666
We didn't even get a
chance to display our four

388
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:53,633
remaining forms.

[equipment beeping]

00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:12,433
-It appears hostilities
have officially begun.

391
00:21:12,466 --> 00:21:14,766
And we have already been
left at a disadvantage.

392
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,900
-We'll just have to
regroup and attack.

393
00:21:16,933 --> 00:21:18,133
-Yes, you have a point.

394
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:21,133
But the reality is our
battle strength is dropping.

395
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:23,000
-All right, time to
get moving, you jerks.

396
00:21:23,033 --> 00:21:24,766
Or are you planning on
lying there forever?

397
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,433
-Chief Hiwatari.

398
00:21:25,466 --> 00:21:26,300
-Get up already.

399
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:27,666
Listen up, ladies.

400
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:30,466
From now on you're not part
of the Re-extermination Squad.

401
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,466
All members are re-enlisted
into the Victor Hunt Squad.

402
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,166
Let's go.

-Yes?

406
00:21:37,466 --> 00:21:38,833
-It looks like
we're finally going

407
00:21:38,866 --> 00:21:41,233
to be able to use our
combination attack.

408
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:41,700
-Huh?

409
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:42,600
Yes, sir.

410
00:21:42,633 --> 00:21:45,466
Please, let's do it.

TOKIKO: I still don't
know who the person was

412
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,133
that appeared
before me back then.

413
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:51,500
I have no leads.

-A mystery man in an
underground chamber.

415

It's just one big
enigma, isn't it?

-Yes.

417
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,266
And that's where I
obtained Kazuki's Kakugane.

418
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:03,033
I'm sure the secret behind
the Black Kakugane is there.

419

-Bravo sacrificed
himself to save me.

420
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,266
And Victor's still out there,
so we've got no time to waste.

Our destination is the Newton

mystery of the Black Kakugane

00:23:56,503 --> 00:23:58,003
is exposed.

425

The existence of a new
one will be revealed.

426
00:24:00,469 --> 00:24:04,203
If we use that, will Kazuki
be able to return to normal?

00:24:04,236 --> 00:24:07,503
Next episode-- a
decision is required.
