NARRATOR: The supernatural
alloy produced

2
00:00:14,255 --> 00:00:18,622
by gathering the essence
of alchemy is the Kakugane.

3
00:00:18,655 --> 00:00:22,622
This device activates upon a
person's fighting instinct,

4
00:00:22,655 --> 00:00:24,922
manifesting the
possessor's inner power

5
00:00:24,955 --> 00:00:29,822
into a tangible form, creating
a weapon like no other.

6
00:00:29,855 --> 00:00:31,188
Its name?

7
00:00:31,222 --> 00:00:31,688
Buso Renkin.

00:00:35,288 --> 00:00:39,222
[theme music]

00:02:08,963 --> 00:02:12,429
-Brobdingnab Finger Strike!

10
00:02:12,463 --> 00:02:14,096
-But I do have a weapon.

11
00:02:14,129 --> 00:02:17,729
My thoroughly trained
warrior body is my weapon.

12
00:02:17,763 --> 00:02:18,229
-Ha!

13
00:02:22,696 --> 00:02:25,329
-I told you already,
I'm not angry.

14
00:02:25,363 --> 00:02:25,829
At all!

15
00:02:32,163 --> 00:02:33,563
-OK, I'll do it.

16
00:02:33,596 --> 00:02:36,396
If we allow the LXE
to continue to exist,

17
00:02:36,429 --> 00:02:37,896
this town will go to pieces.

18
00:02:37,929 --> 00:02:42,129
Captain Bravo, please make
me into an alchemist warrior.

19
00:02:42,163 --> 00:02:46,863
-Kazuki Muto, you can't always
rely on your Buso Renkin alone.

20
00:02:46,896 --> 00:02:50,463
If you keep on fighting the way
you have been all this time,

21
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:54,763
you'll never win, and
you'll get yourself killed.

22
00:02:54,796 --> 00:02:56,963
In order to make you into
an Alchemist Warrior,

23
00:02:56,996 --> 00:02:58,996
I'll train you without mercy.

24
00:02:59,029 --> 00:03:00,829
If you don't want to
parish, sink your teeth

25
00:03:00,863 --> 00:03:02,529
in with a do or die resolve.

26
00:03:02,563 --> 00:03:03,363
Got it?

27
00:03:03,396 --> 00:03:03,896
-Hm.

28
00:03:07,096 --> 00:03:10,763
-Same goes for you,
warrior Tokiko.

29
00:03:10,796 --> 00:03:13,996
Protecting rookies is my duty.

30
00:03:14,029 --> 00:03:16,529
So leave Muto to me from now on.

31
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:19,096
Go and recover your
warrior instincts.

32
00:03:19,129 --> 00:03:21,396
If you don't,
you'll be defeated--

33
00:03:21,429 --> 00:03:22,696
and get yourself killed.

34
00:03:29,429 --> 00:03:29,963
BOY: Hey.

35
00:03:29,996 --> 00:03:31,329
What's going on?

36
00:03:31,363 --> 00:03:32,163
I don't know.

37
00:03:32,196 --> 00:03:33,263
Did you see that on the roof?

38
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:34,196
I know I saw something.

39
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:35,663
BOY: Did you guys see that?

40
00:03:38,563 --> 00:03:39,496
-Whoa.

41
00:03:39,529 --> 00:03:40,896
Looks like we've drawn a crowd.

42
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:42,496
-We should avoid them.

43
00:03:42,529 --> 00:03:43,863
Let's go.

44
00:03:43,896 --> 00:03:45,529
-Hyahoo!

45
00:03:45,563 --> 00:03:47,263
-He's alive!

46
00:03:47,296 --> 00:03:49,329
-I avoided striking his vitals.

47
00:03:49,363 --> 00:03:53,063
We need to get him to tell
us information about the LXE.

48
00:03:53,096 --> 00:03:54,329
-You gotta be joking.

49
00:03:54,363 --> 00:03:56,096
If I were to do
something like that,

50
00:03:56,129 --> 00:03:59,363
who knows what Dr. Butterfly
would end up doing to me?

51
00:03:59,396 --> 00:04:00,829
-Don't worry about it.

52
00:04:00,863 --> 00:04:02,796
You'll end up wanting
to talk regardless

53
00:04:02,829 --> 00:04:05,396
of what's in store for you.

54
00:04:05,429 --> 00:04:07,029
-I'm not so sure about that.

55
00:04:13,663 --> 00:04:15,396
-Good work, Kinjo.

56
00:04:15,429 --> 00:04:17,729
I will let you die quickly.

57
00:04:17,763 --> 00:04:19,396
-Thank you, Jinnai.

58
00:04:24,396 --> 00:04:25,763
-He killed his own comrade.

59
00:04:25,796 --> 00:04:27,763
-In order to silence him.

60
00:04:27,796 --> 00:04:30,363
-You may keep the
Kakugane for the moment,

61
00:04:30,396 --> 00:04:32,996
but I'll be back to
retrieve it soon.

62
00:04:33,029 --> 00:04:36,296
Homunculi can be
easily replaced.

63
00:04:36,329 --> 00:04:40,163
But unfortunately,
Kakugane cannot.

64
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:42,596
So it is my duty to recover it.

65
00:04:42,629 --> 00:04:43,829
Until next time.

66
00:05:01,063 --> 00:05:02,563
-This is not my day.

67
00:05:02,596 --> 00:05:04,529
Why are we the ones
who have to carry this?

68
00:05:04,563 --> 00:05:05,829
-I know, I know.

69
00:05:05,863 --> 00:05:06,996
Just don't drop it.

70
00:05:14,096 --> 00:05:16,363
-Who the hell is he?

71
00:05:16,396 --> 00:05:17,796
-From the drama club?

72
00:05:17,829 --> 00:05:19,163
-Wrong answer.

73
00:05:19,196 --> 00:05:22,763
Now, for your own sake,
better not get involved.

74
00:05:22,796 --> 00:05:25,729
[screaming]

75
00:05:25,763 --> 00:05:27,429
-Kakugane.

76
00:05:27,463 --> 00:05:30,329
So I guess even this
small fry gets one.

77
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:32,663
But I don't, huh?

78
00:05:32,696 --> 00:05:36,263
This is most unpleasant.

79
00:05:36,296 --> 00:05:38,696
-There are three
things we are sure of.

80
00:05:38,729 --> 00:05:40,729
First of all is
that Papillon still

81
00:05:40,763 --> 00:05:43,696
doesn't have a Kakugane
like the rest of us do.

82
00:05:43,729 --> 00:05:46,629
It seems his man-eating appetite
has regressed for the time

83
00:05:46,663 --> 00:05:50,196
being, so therefore we can put
off dealing with him for now.

84
00:05:50,229 --> 00:05:52,196
Secondly, there's the LXE.

85
00:05:52,229 --> 00:05:54,363
All their actions so
far seem to indicate

86
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:55,763
that they don't
have the slightest

87
00:05:55,796 --> 00:05:59,563
intention of launching any sort
of all out attack against us.

88
00:05:59,596 --> 00:06:02,796
This is probably because
their strongest LXE member,

89
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:06,629
the Warrior Traitor, has
not fully recovered yet.

90
00:06:06,663 --> 00:06:09,129
Of course, there's
no reason for us

91
00:06:09,163 --> 00:06:11,363
to wait until they're
ready to strike.

92
00:06:11,396 --> 00:06:13,963
We must locate their hideout,
make a quick assessment

93
00:06:13,996 --> 00:06:17,896
of their numbers, and wipe
them out in a single blow.

94
00:06:17,929 --> 00:06:21,663
Third and finally,
there's you, Muto.

95
00:06:21,696 --> 00:06:24,396
Just as Warrior
Tokiko has reported,

96
00:06:24,429 --> 00:06:27,529
your sunlight heart is
indeed very powerful.

97
00:06:27,563 --> 00:06:29,663
However, for now
it's pretty clear

98
00:06:29,696 --> 00:06:32,163
that you are not able to
beat a humanoid Homunculus

99
00:06:32,196 --> 00:06:32,963
on your own.

100
00:06:32,996 --> 00:06:34,629
-I need training.

101
00:06:34,663 --> 00:06:36,196
-Special training.

102
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:39,463
We'll start today.

103
00:06:39,496 --> 00:06:40,929
-I'm ready.

104
00:06:40,963 --> 00:06:42,696
-Warrior Chief,
I'd like to assist

105
00:06:42,729 --> 00:06:44,596
in Kazuki's special training.

106
00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:45,996
-Afraid not.

107
00:06:46,029 --> 00:06:47,996
I've got a different
mission in mind for you.

108
00:07:02,063 --> 00:07:02,763
-Seconds, please.

109
00:07:06,896 --> 00:07:09,129
Thank you for a delicious meal.

110
00:07:09,163 --> 00:07:09,963
-I won.

111
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:10,863
-Not bad.

112
00:07:10,896 --> 00:07:12,196
It's a draw.

113
00:07:12,229 --> 00:07:13,429
All right.

114
00:07:13,463 --> 00:07:15,029
Time to go.

115
00:07:15,063 --> 00:07:15,629
Ready, Muto?

116
00:07:15,663 --> 00:07:16,729
-Yeah, Bravo.

117
00:07:16,763 --> 00:07:18,363
You bet I am.

118
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:22,629
As a matter of fact, I'm a
master of special training.

119
00:07:22,663 --> 00:07:23,729
-Bravo.

120
00:07:23,763 --> 00:07:27,196
I'm also a master
of special training.

121
00:07:27,229 --> 00:07:27,996
-Special training?

122
00:07:28,029 --> 00:07:28,996
What do you mean?

123
00:07:29,029 --> 00:07:30,763
-Well, it's a secret.

124
00:07:30,796 --> 00:07:31,863
Because--

125
00:07:31,896 --> 00:07:35,663
-It's just cooler that way.

126
00:07:35,696 --> 00:07:36,163
-Ah!

127
00:07:45,163 --> 00:07:48,496
Kazuki and Captain Bravo left.

128
00:07:48,529 --> 00:07:50,563
You're not gonna go with them?

129
00:07:50,596 --> 00:07:51,096
-Not today.

130
00:07:51,129 --> 00:07:51,863
-Oh, really?

131
00:07:51,896 --> 00:07:54,263
Well, that's a first.

132
00:07:54,296 --> 00:07:56,029
-Well, it happens sometimes.

133
00:07:56,063 --> 00:07:57,396
-Oh, I what.

134
00:07:57,429 --> 00:07:59,629
You can hang out with
me and the girls.

135
00:07:59,663 --> 00:08:01,029
-No, that's all right.

136
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:02,696
That's not really
my thing, thanks.

137
00:08:02,729 --> 00:08:05,296
-Then how about if a guy
was to hang out, too?

138
00:08:05,329 --> 00:08:06,429
-That's not what I meant.

139
00:08:06,463 --> 00:08:07,263
-I'm in!

140
00:08:07,296 --> 00:08:08,229
So what are we gonna play, huh?

141
00:08:08,263 --> 00:08:09,363
-Othello!

142
00:08:09,396 --> 00:08:12,763
-But only two people
can play that.

143
00:08:12,796 --> 00:08:15,463
-What do you think, Chii-chin?

144
00:08:15,496 --> 00:08:17,063
-I like to play Memory.

145
00:08:17,096 --> 00:08:18,129
I guess.

146
00:08:18,163 --> 00:08:19,129
-See that?

147
00:08:19,163 --> 00:08:21,829
Chii-chin just loves
to play Memory.

148
00:08:21,863 --> 00:08:24,596
-Do you have any idea, Tokiko?

149
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:25,429
-No, really.

150
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:26,929
Thanks, but I'll pass.

151
00:08:26,963 --> 00:08:27,863
-Oh, but why?

152
00:08:27,896 --> 00:08:28,796
Come on.

153
00:08:28,829 --> 00:08:30,263
-I'm so sorry.

154
00:08:30,296 --> 00:08:32,696
Some other time, OK?

155
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:33,929
-Guess not today.

156
00:08:33,963 --> 00:08:35,263
Maybe another time.

157
00:08:35,296 --> 00:08:37,529
Sounds like a deal to me.

158
00:08:37,563 --> 00:08:39,396
TOKIKO (VOICEOVER):
Why'd I say I'm sorry?

159
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:41,296
I didn't have to
apologize for anything.

160
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:49,663
-Ha.

161
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:50,729
So there it is.

162
00:08:56,963 --> 00:08:59,763
BRAVO: I've got a different
mission in mind for you.

163
00:08:59,796 --> 00:09:01,563
In a battle between
an Alchemist Warrior

164
00:09:01,596 --> 00:09:04,063
and a humanoid
Homunculus, Kakugane

165
00:09:04,096 --> 00:09:06,029
is exactly like I Shogi piece.

166
00:09:06,063 --> 00:09:08,463
If you have it, it is
a huge asset in battle.

167
00:09:08,496 --> 00:09:11,063
But if you lose it, the enemy
will use it against you.

168
00:09:14,629 --> 00:09:16,129
I want you to safeguard this.

169
00:09:16,163 --> 00:09:17,663
They'll try to get back.

170
00:09:17,696 --> 00:09:20,396
I'll be focusing on
Kazuki's special training.

171
00:09:20,429 --> 00:09:23,029
-But sir, I can help
with the special training

172
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:26,529
and hang on to the
Kakugane at the same time.

173
00:09:26,563 --> 00:09:29,196
-Like I said, just leave
the protection of the rookie

174
00:09:29,229 --> 00:09:31,096
to me, all right?

175
00:09:31,129 --> 00:09:32,629
You're too protective
of Kazuki Muto.

176
00:09:35,063 --> 00:09:36,329
TOKIKO (VOICEOVER): He's right.

177
00:09:36,363 --> 00:09:37,996
During the whole
Papillon thing, I

178
00:09:38,029 --> 00:09:40,629
was more worried about
protecting Kazuki than anything

179
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:43,596
else, even with a Homunculus
right in front of me.

180
00:09:43,629 --> 00:09:46,029
BRAVO (VOICEOVER): Go and
recover your warrior instincts.

181
00:09:46,063 --> 00:09:48,429
If you don't, you
will be defeated,

182
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:50,729
and get yourself killed.

183
00:09:50,763 --> 00:09:52,463
TOKIKO (VOICEOVER):
My warrior instincts.

184
00:09:52,496 --> 00:09:52,963
Huh.

185
00:09:56,196 --> 00:09:58,396
What's this?

186
00:09:58,429 --> 00:10:00,763
-Buso Renkin.

187
00:10:00,796 --> 00:10:01,629
Noisy Hamelin.

188
00:10:13,096 --> 00:10:14,729
TOKIKO (VOCIEOVER):
Ultrasonic waves?

189
00:10:14,763 --> 00:10:16,329
Oscillating waves.

190
00:10:16,363 --> 00:10:18,363
Whatever it is, it's
piercing my ears.

191
00:10:18,396 --> 00:10:19,563
It's the enemy's attack.

192
00:10:22,763 --> 00:10:23,829
-All right, then.

193
00:10:23,863 --> 00:10:26,029
Begin looking for the
important treasure

194
00:10:26,063 --> 00:10:30,029
in there, my pretty little pets.

195
00:10:30,063 --> 00:10:35,996
[white noise]

196
00:10:36,029 --> 00:10:37,396
-Hm?

197
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:37,896
Hm?

198
00:10:40,863 --> 00:10:42,196
[music playing]

199
00:10:42,229 --> 00:10:44,263
-Am I imagining things?

200
00:10:44,296 --> 00:10:45,129
-Dammit.

201
00:10:45,163 --> 00:10:47,363
A tracking device.

202
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:49,196
-I've been detected.

203
00:10:49,229 --> 00:10:50,196
Too late.

204
00:10:50,229 --> 00:10:53,163
I'm already here.

205
00:10:53,196 --> 00:10:54,896
Now that I've made
it this far, I

206
00:10:54,929 --> 00:10:57,796
can follow everything by
sound, and my adorable pets

207
00:10:57,829 --> 00:10:59,463
will do the rest for me.

208
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:06,645
[groaning]

209
00:11:11,793 --> 00:11:13,215
JINNAI: What will you do now?

210
00:11:13,248 --> 00:11:15,582
Anyone who has their
brains affected

211
00:11:15,615 --> 00:11:21,815
by the sound of my Noisy Hamelon
become my ally, and your enemy.

212
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:23,248
-Kakugane.

213
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:25,215
[groaning]

214
00:11:25,248 --> 00:11:25,715
-Kakugane.

215
00:11:28,615 --> 00:11:30,182
TOKIKO (VOICEOVER):
Hypnotic control.

216
00:11:30,215 --> 00:11:32,615
The effects of the
sound waves from before.

217
00:11:32,648 --> 00:11:37,748
Then that means--
the enemy is not far.

218
00:11:37,782 --> 00:11:39,782
He must be within ear
range, and in the direction

219
00:11:39,815 --> 00:11:41,582
the wave originated from.

220
00:11:41,615 --> 00:11:43,648
BOY: Tokiko!

221
00:11:43,682 --> 00:11:44,482
-Kazuki?

222
00:11:44,515 --> 00:11:45,082
-What's up?

223
00:11:45,115 --> 00:11:45,648
I'm Kazuki.

224
00:11:49,015 --> 00:11:50,182
-Sorry.

225
00:11:50,215 --> 00:11:51,782
Just hold still
for a bit, Tokiko.

226
00:11:51,815 --> 00:11:52,815
OK?

227
00:11:52,848 --> 00:11:55,715
-Yes, I am a pervert.

228
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:58,082
A really good one, at that!

229
00:11:58,115 --> 00:12:00,982
Ha ha!

230
00:12:01,015 --> 00:12:02,882
-Let go of me.

231
00:12:02,915 --> 00:12:03,815
-Huh?

232
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:06,582
-I'm warning you,
don't touch me.

233
00:12:06,615 --> 00:12:09,048
-I'll touch you!

234
00:12:09,082 --> 00:12:14,015
Tokiko's so soft and
smooth-skinned, yes.

235
00:12:14,048 --> 00:12:16,482
Toki, where's the Kakugane?

236
00:12:16,515 --> 00:12:17,482
Give me the Kakugane!

237
00:12:17,515 --> 00:12:18,948
Give it to me!

238
00:12:18,982 --> 00:12:21,448
[groaning]

239
00:12:21,482 --> 00:12:23,915
-Kakugane.

240
00:12:23,948 --> 00:12:24,415
-Kakugane.

241
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:29,848
-Bravo Backbreaker!

242
00:12:33,382 --> 00:12:37,182
Bravo Octopus Hold.

243
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:39,815
Bravo Rotation Throw!

244
00:12:39,848 --> 00:12:42,115
Ah, ha ha!

245
00:12:42,148 --> 00:12:42,882
All right!

246
00:12:42,915 --> 00:12:44,915
That's it for the warm up.

247
00:12:44,948 --> 00:12:48,015
-Tell me, does a rotation
count as a warm up?

248
00:12:48,048 --> 00:12:49,282
-Bravo.

249
00:12:49,315 --> 00:12:54,082
We'll start the special training
after a 10 minute break.

250
00:12:54,115 --> 00:12:54,582
-Oh.

251
00:12:57,382 --> 00:12:59,915
Can I ask you something?

252
00:12:59,948 --> 00:13:01,148
-Huh?

253
00:13:01,182 --> 00:13:04,048
-We still don't know how
organized the LXE is, right?

254
00:13:04,082 --> 00:13:06,282
What if they are the kind
of opponents the three of us

255
00:13:06,315 --> 00:13:08,182
might not be able
to handle alone?

256
00:13:08,215 --> 00:13:12,015
-If that's the case,
what would you do?

257
00:13:12,048 --> 00:13:15,615
-Call the police?

258
00:13:15,648 --> 00:13:16,882
-I see.

259
00:13:16,915 --> 00:13:20,848
Well-- and tell me, how
would you explain it to them?

260
00:13:20,882 --> 00:13:21,415
-Hm.

261
00:13:24,882 --> 00:13:25,815
-Kakugane.

262
00:13:25,848 --> 00:13:28,282
[groaning]

263
00:13:28,315 --> 00:13:30,248
-I'm surrounded.

264
00:13:30,282 --> 00:13:32,715
[laughter]

265
00:13:32,748 --> 00:13:34,348
-That's correct.

266
00:13:34,382 --> 00:13:37,448
Your opposition are
actually humans,

267
00:13:37,482 --> 00:13:38,848
so there's nothing you can do.

268
00:13:38,882 --> 00:13:40,382
TOKIKO (VOICEOVER):
What should I do?

269
00:13:40,415 --> 00:13:43,315
-Where's the Kakugane?

270
00:13:43,348 --> 00:13:45,282
Give me the Kakugane.

271
00:13:45,315 --> 00:13:46,248
Give me--

272
00:13:53,148 --> 00:13:55,748
TOKIKO (VOICEOVER): Just
you wait, Homunculus.

273
00:13:55,782 --> 00:14:00,182
-I guess that was kind of a
stupid question, wasn't it?

274
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:02,782
-It's absolutely natural
to think that way.

275
00:14:02,815 --> 00:14:04,582
But remember,
you've now set foot

276
00:14:04,615 --> 00:14:08,182
in an extraordinary world
of supernatural proportions.

277
00:14:08,215 --> 00:14:10,182
-Extraordinary world.

278
00:14:10,215 --> 00:14:12,315
-The only ones who can
stop an uncommon enemy

279
00:14:12,348 --> 00:14:15,782
like the Homunculi are those of
us who share a similar reality.

280
00:14:15,815 --> 00:14:19,048
No one else could
handle such an opponent.

281
00:14:19,082 --> 00:14:21,048
No matter how strong
the enemy may be,

282
00:14:21,082 --> 00:14:23,715
or how difficult the
battle sometimes may seem,

283
00:14:23,748 --> 00:14:26,482
we must defeat them.

284
00:14:26,515 --> 00:14:28,948
Because we are
Alchemist Warriors.

285
00:14:28,982 --> 00:14:29,448
-Hm!

286
00:14:32,415 --> 00:14:36,115
JINNAI: The Alchemist
Warrior-- he is approaching.

287
00:14:36,148 --> 00:14:38,082
But how?

288
00:14:38,115 --> 00:14:42,748
How did she-- how was she
able to get past my pets?

289
00:14:42,782 --> 00:14:44,782
Could it be she slashed
through all of them?

290
00:14:47,915 --> 00:14:50,382
She used her Buso Renkin
to run on the walls!

291
00:14:50,415 --> 00:14:52,382
-I've found you,
Homunculus beast.

292
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:55,448
-I guess I'll retreat
for the time being.

293
00:14:55,482 --> 00:14:56,682
-I won't let you get away.

294
00:14:59,582 --> 00:15:00,815
Chii-chin!

295
00:15:00,848 --> 00:15:02,948
-I'll just go to the bathroom,
and then head to bed.

296
00:15:02,982 --> 00:15:04,615
-Look out!

297
00:15:04,648 --> 00:15:06,248
-She looks tasty.

298
00:15:06,282 --> 00:15:08,982
I'll devour her, so
that I can heal my moods

299
00:15:09,015 --> 00:15:10,282
and counterattack.

300
00:15:10,315 --> 00:15:12,682
[scream]

301
00:15:12,715 --> 00:15:13,182
-No!

302
00:15:19,948 --> 00:15:22,348
[scream]

303
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:38,482
-Now I understand the
Warrior Chief's intention.

304
00:15:38,515 --> 00:15:40,915
-Does your wound hurt?

305
00:15:40,948 --> 00:15:45,148
I wasn't able to have my
meal, so I guess we're even.

306
00:15:45,182 --> 00:15:47,382
But then again,
I'm a Homunculus,

307
00:15:47,415 --> 00:15:50,015
so my wounds are
already healing.

308
00:15:50,048 --> 00:15:53,515
The more time passes,
the greater my advantage.

309
00:15:53,548 --> 00:15:56,015
I'm going to eat you
one piece at a time.

310
00:15:56,048 --> 00:15:58,415
But I'll tear your
entire body apart,

311
00:15:58,448 --> 00:16:01,015
making it easier
for me to feast.

312
00:16:01,048 --> 00:16:03,915
-The reason I'm here is so
that terrible day will never

313
00:16:03,948 --> 00:16:05,282
be repeated again.

314
00:16:05,315 --> 00:16:07,248
I must kill all the Homunculi.

315
00:16:14,582 --> 00:16:17,015
BRAVO: I should
probably tell you this.

316
00:16:17,048 --> 00:16:18,048
-What?

317
00:16:18,082 --> 00:16:19,415
-There's not much
difference from how

318
00:16:19,448 --> 00:16:22,815
we prefer our meat to the way
the Homunculi choose theirs.

319
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:25,982
The younger and fresher it is,
the tastier and more tender

320
00:16:26,015 --> 00:16:26,615
it is.

321
00:16:26,648 --> 00:16:27,982
Or so they claim.

322
00:16:28,015 --> 00:16:29,982
So when they form a
group and take action,

323
00:16:30,015 --> 00:16:31,415
that's what they look for.

324
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:33,948
They tend to target
schools as prime locations

325
00:16:33,982 --> 00:16:36,882
for securing their food.

326
00:16:36,915 --> 00:16:39,782
Ginsei Academy is an
irresistible target.

327
00:16:39,815 --> 00:16:43,782
It has a whole dormitory
full of sleeping livestock.

328
00:16:43,815 --> 00:16:47,148
-So then enrolling Tokiko in the
school was a preemptive move.

329
00:16:47,182 --> 00:16:50,148
-Rather, a last ditch effort.

330
00:16:50,182 --> 00:16:52,748
Seven years ago, we
Alchemist Warriors

331
00:16:52,782 --> 00:16:55,715
were a day late
and a dollar short,

332
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:59,515
and ended up sacrificing an
entire elementary school.

333
00:16:59,548 --> 00:17:02,548
We must not repeat that
tragedy ever again.

334
00:17:02,582 --> 00:17:04,182
-Not just in the schools.

335
00:17:04,215 --> 00:17:05,382
-Hm?

336
00:17:05,415 --> 00:17:07,715
-Not just my little sister
and my friends, either.

337
00:17:07,748 --> 00:17:11,348
I'll protect all people
from the Homunculi.

338
00:17:11,382 --> 00:17:13,548
-Well, in that case you
must first get stronger.

339
00:17:13,582 --> 00:17:14,782
And that's my responsibility.

340
00:17:17,082 --> 00:17:18,282
I will have no mercy.

341
00:17:18,315 --> 00:17:20,348
Prepare yourself.

342
00:17:20,382 --> 00:17:21,415
-All right, I'm ready.

343
00:17:21,448 --> 00:17:23,248
Let's do it, Bravo.

344
00:17:23,282 --> 00:17:25,282
BRAVO AND KAZUKI: Buso Renkin!

345
00:17:25,315 --> 00:17:27,648
JINNAI: Oh, it-- it hurts.

346
00:17:27,682 --> 00:17:29,115
-Don't make me laugh.

347
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:32,382
There's no way a monster should
feel something like pain.

348
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,782
-No, it's true.

349
00:17:33,815 --> 00:17:35,282
It really does hurt.

350
00:17:35,315 --> 00:17:38,515
-Tell me where the LXE base
is, and who the members are.

351
00:17:38,548 --> 00:17:39,448
-I'll talk, I'll talk.

352
00:17:39,482 --> 00:17:41,615
Please just stop already!

353
00:17:41,648 --> 00:17:52,415
[groaning] You've really done
it this time, little girl.

354
00:17:52,448 --> 00:17:54,315
I will make you pay!

355
00:17:54,348 --> 00:17:56,082
-I'll make things
easier if you talk.

356
00:17:56,115 --> 00:17:57,082
But if you don't--

357
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:07,648
[scream]

358
00:18:07,682 --> 00:18:08,148
-It hurts.

359
00:18:08,182 --> 00:18:11,048
It hurts!

360
00:18:11,082 --> 00:18:13,048
[sigh]

361
00:18:13,082 --> 00:18:14,515
PAPILLON: If you
don't talk, you'll

362
00:18:14,548 --> 00:18:17,148
suffer the torments of
hell before you die?

363
00:18:17,182 --> 00:18:19,915
When you talk like that,
it's hard to distinguish

364
00:18:19,948 --> 00:18:23,815
who is the monster,
and who is the human.

365
00:18:23,848 --> 00:18:25,282
-Papillon.

366
00:18:25,315 --> 00:18:27,882
-No, no, no.

367
00:18:27,915 --> 00:18:29,482
Papillon.

368
00:18:29,515 --> 00:18:32,548
You must put more love into it.

369
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,482
-Kazuki's not
going to like this,

370
00:18:37,515 --> 00:18:40,182
but I kill all
Homunculi in my path.

371
00:18:40,215 --> 00:18:41,182
-Oh?

372
00:18:41,215 --> 00:18:42,182
Ha ha!

373
00:18:48,615 --> 00:18:51,682
-A decoy.

374
00:18:51,715 --> 00:18:53,948
-Please tell Kazuki
this message.

375
00:18:53,982 --> 00:18:56,315
With this, I'll get stronger.

376
00:18:56,348 --> 00:18:59,148
And if he doesn't get
stronger this time around,

377
00:18:59,182 --> 00:19:03,348
then he won't be able to
protect poor little Tokiko.

378
00:19:03,382 --> 00:19:04,648
-Don't press your luck.

379
00:19:08,548 --> 00:19:09,648
Wake up.

380
00:19:09,682 --> 00:19:10,415
Are you all right?

381
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:16,248
-What happened?

382
00:19:16,282 --> 00:19:17,548
[yawning]

383
00:19:17,582 --> 00:19:20,182
-I don't know why, but I'm
feeling this sense of guilt.

384
00:19:20,215 --> 00:19:21,848
-I feel kinda happy.

385
00:19:21,882 --> 00:19:23,515
With a hint of embarrassment.

386
00:19:23,548 --> 00:19:25,782
It's a good feeling,
nonetheless.

387
00:19:25,815 --> 00:19:28,148
-Tokiko, so soft,
such smooth skin.

388
00:19:28,182 --> 00:19:29,082
-What's up?

389
00:19:29,115 --> 00:19:30,248
Hi, I'm Kazuki.

390
00:19:33,615 --> 00:19:34,548
-My head hurts.

391
00:19:34,582 --> 00:19:35,948
BOY: Why am I so tired?

392
00:19:35,982 --> 00:19:37,815
-Besides the fact that
they were very sleepy,

393
00:19:37,848 --> 00:19:40,248
there doesn't seem to be
any other aftereffect.

394
00:19:40,282 --> 00:19:42,848
They should have no recollection
of what went on last night.

395
00:19:42,882 --> 00:19:44,148
-Bravo, Tokiko.

396
00:19:44,182 --> 00:19:45,882
Very well done.

397
00:19:45,915 --> 00:19:48,982
-But Papillon got a
hold of the Kakugane.

398
00:19:49,015 --> 00:19:50,682
I'm sorry, Warrior Chief.

399
00:19:50,715 --> 00:19:52,215
-Don't apologize.

400
00:19:52,248 --> 00:19:54,382
It's my fault for
overlooking the transmitter

401
00:19:54,415 --> 00:19:55,415
in the first place.

402
00:19:55,448 --> 00:19:56,648
-Huh?

403
00:19:56,682 --> 00:19:58,515
-This training is extremely
rough on a normal boy

404
00:19:58,548 --> 00:19:59,482
like Kazuki.

405
00:19:59,515 --> 00:20:01,682
He has a long road ahead of him.

406
00:20:01,715 --> 00:20:04,582
I wonder how long
he's going to last.

407
00:20:04,615 --> 00:20:08,682
-I have no doubt that
Kazuki will get through it.

408
00:20:08,715 --> 00:20:09,615
But I

409
00:20:09,648 --> 00:20:10,682
-Huh?

410
00:20:10,715 --> 00:20:12,682
-I just-- I still
don't want him moving

411
00:20:12,715 --> 00:20:14,315
any closer to a world of battle.

412
00:20:14,348 --> 00:20:16,848
So I won't let any
enemy near him.

413
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:20,048
I'm prepared and willing
to do my own fighting.

414
00:20:20,082 --> 00:20:22,748
And I'm ready to take his
share whenever it calls for it.

415
00:20:28,848 --> 00:20:31,115
-Maybe I got her a
little too worked up.

416
00:20:31,148 --> 00:20:33,082
She's more dangerous
now than she was before.

417
00:20:36,548 --> 00:20:39,982
Although it's inevitable that
some warriors fall in battle,

418
00:20:40,015 --> 00:20:42,348
it is harder when
they are so young.

419
00:20:42,382 --> 00:20:44,782
I must avoid that,
whatever the cost.

420
00:20:58,148 --> 00:21:00,348
TOKIKO (VOICEOVER): Last
night ended without incident,

421
00:21:00,382 --> 00:21:01,582
but it was luck.

422
00:21:01,615 --> 00:21:07,348
If one thing went slightly
wrong thing then--

423
00:21:07,382 --> 00:21:11,548
I have no intention of seeing
that site sight ever again.

424
00:21:11,582 --> 00:21:13,715
I have to kill the Homunculi.

425
00:21:13,748 --> 00:21:15,848
I must kill all the enemies.

426
00:21:18,648 --> 00:21:21,082
[bell ringing]

427
00:21:21,115 --> 00:21:24,548
[snoring]

428
00:21:27,582 --> 00:21:28,515
-Huh?

429
00:21:28,548 --> 00:21:31,782
But on, Bravo!

430
00:21:31,815 --> 00:21:33,782
Huh?

431
00:21:33,815 --> 00:21:34,782
-Good morning.

432
00:21:34,815 --> 00:21:35,582
Better hurry.

433
00:21:35,615 --> 00:21:36,782
You'll be late for homeroom.

434
00:21:36,815 --> 00:21:37,482
KAZUKI: Huh?

435
00:21:37,515 --> 00:21:38,882
Oh, uh, right.

436
00:21:38,915 --> 00:21:39,548
Thanks.

437
00:21:39,582 --> 00:21:42,748
Uh, and who are you?

438
00:21:42,782 --> 00:21:44,715
[giggle]

439
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:57,552
[theme music]

440
00:23:24,352 --> 00:23:25,786
TOKIKO: I would
never have imagined

441
00:23:25,819 --> 00:23:28,919
the LXE making an attack
in such a bold way.

442
00:23:28,952 --> 00:23:31,219
Two Homunculi attack Kazuki.

443
00:23:31,252 --> 00:23:33,119
Those two are twin siblings.

444
00:23:33,152 --> 00:23:34,352
Who are they?

445
00:23:34,386 --> 00:23:38,719
Next time, The Hayasaka Twins,
I'll Splatter Your Guts!

446
00:23:43,686 --> 00:23:44,686
-Hey, there.

447
00:23:44,719 --> 00:23:46,919
This is Mahiro Muto
with another round

448
00:23:46,952 --> 00:23:50,319
of our smashing
seminar of Buso Renkin.

449
00:23:50,352 --> 00:23:53,886
For our third presentation,
we have Captain Bravo's Buso

450
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:56,252
Renking, the Silver Skin.

451
00:23:56,286 --> 00:23:58,486
Captain Bravo is
the mysterious guy

452
00:23:58,519 --> 00:24:01,752
who suddenly appeared to
become the manager of our dorm

453
00:24:01,786 --> 00:24:03,752
at Ginsei Academy.

454
00:24:03,786 --> 00:24:06,052
He's known as the
Warrior Chief, which

455
00:24:06,086 --> 00:24:08,619
is a very high ranking
Alchemist Warrior.

456
00:24:08,652 --> 00:24:13,019
His real name is a secret,
because it's cooler that way.

457
00:24:13,052 --> 00:24:15,219
That just makes no sense.

458
00:24:15,252 --> 00:24:17,619
Anyway, he seems like
a reliable old man--

459
00:24:17,652 --> 00:24:20,652
uh, I mean young guy--
and together with Tokiko

460
00:24:20,686 --> 00:24:23,519
and Kazuki, fights
to protect us.

461
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:26,819
Captain Bravo's Buso
Renkin is the Silver Skin.

462
00:24:26,852 --> 00:24:30,386
That weird uniform he wears
is really a metal jacket.

463
00:24:30,419 --> 00:24:32,319
In other words, a
protective suit.

464
00:24:32,352 --> 00:24:34,986
It can completely shut out
any sort of powerful attack

465
00:24:35,019 --> 00:24:37,186
by hardening itself into metal.

466
00:24:37,219 --> 00:24:39,786
And by the way, not only
can it deflect physical

467
00:24:39,819 --> 00:24:43,252
attacks, but also
chemical weapons, as well.

468
00:24:43,286 --> 00:24:44,719
-Wow!

469
00:24:44,752 --> 00:24:45,686
That's incredible.

470
00:24:45,719 --> 00:24:47,886
He's like a walking
bomb shelter.

471
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:49,719
Well, maybe that's a bit off.

472
00:24:49,752 --> 00:24:52,819
But anyway, even if the
Silver Skin gets damaged,

473
00:24:52,852 --> 00:24:57,552
it can always instantly
repair itself back to normal.

474
00:24:57,586 --> 00:24:59,486
That is impenetrable.

475
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:01,752
Unfortunately, the
Silver Skin itself

476
00:25:01,786 --> 00:25:03,119
has absolutely no
offensive power.

477
00:25:03,152 --> 00:25:08,152
But that's OK, since Bravo's
weapon is his own body itself,

478
00:25:08,186 --> 00:25:09,819
which has been
trained to the limits.

479
00:25:09,852 --> 00:25:13,619
He's so strong, he can defeat
a Homunculus bare-handed.

480
00:25:13,652 --> 00:25:16,019
With his iron first
and silver skin,

481
00:25:16,052 --> 00:25:17,852
Bravo is absolutely invincible!

482
00:25:17,886 --> 00:25:20,052
They can bring on
whatever the enemies have,

483
00:25:20,086 --> 00:25:23,419
because Captain
Bravo can take them!

484
00:25:23,452 --> 00:25:26,386
But please, tell us
your real name, already.

485
00:25:26,419 --> 00:25:27,286
Okie Dokie.

486
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:29,419
Tune in next time!
