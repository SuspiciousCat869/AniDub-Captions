00:00:12,535 --> 00:00:14,557
NARRATOR: The supernatural
alloy produced

2
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:19,024
by gathering the essence
of alchemy is the Kakugane.

3
00:00:19,057 --> 00:00:22,957
This device activates upon a
person's fighting instinct,

4
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:25,557
manifesting the
possessor's inner power

5
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:30,224
into a tangible form, creating
a weapon like no other.

6
00:00:30,257 --> 00:00:32,190
Its name, Buso Renkin.

7
00:00:36,357 --> 00:00:40,824
[theme music]

8
00:02:10,553 --> 00:02:13,853
-Clean out your
ears and listen up.

9
00:02:13,887 --> 00:02:17,287
I'm about to tell you everything
there is to know about the LXE.

10
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,953
But before that, Tokiko,
get down on your knees.

11
00:02:19,987 --> 00:02:21,287
-Huh?

12
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,353
-You need to apologize, because
when you two were fighting,

13
00:02:22,387 --> 00:02:23,720
you tried to kill Ouka.

14
00:02:23,753 --> 00:02:26,453
And if she dies, I'll disappear
along with her, you witch!

15
00:02:26,487 --> 00:02:28,620
If you had killed
Ouka and Shusui,

16
00:02:28,653 --> 00:02:30,753
you wouldn't be getting
any info, now, would you?

17
00:02:30,787 --> 00:02:32,020
Show some respect, you moron!

18
00:02:32,053 --> 00:02:33,820
You're not so bright, are you?

19
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:35,387
You're a failure as a warrior!

20
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,320
It's clear, already!

21
00:02:37,353 --> 00:02:38,787
-Calm down.

22
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:42,287
-Despite her appearance,
Warrior Tokiko is very gifted.

23
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,020
Even though she can
get out of control

24
00:02:44,053 --> 00:02:45,353
when she loses her temper.

25
00:02:45,387 --> 00:02:47,620
-Trust me, deep down
she's very nice.

26
00:02:47,653 --> 00:02:49,220
But she'll want to
splatter your guts.

27
00:02:49,253 --> 00:02:50,887
-You both better apologize.

28
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,087
-Ow!

29
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,587
-It'll get dark very soon,
so let's get to this.

30
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,587
The League of
Extraordinary Elects,

31
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,053
commonly known as the LXE--

32
00:02:58,087 --> 00:03:00,353
-Basically, the skinny is--

33
00:03:00,387 --> 00:03:03,620
BRAVO: The LXE is a community
of Homunculi and Familiars

34
00:03:03,653 --> 00:03:05,453
in the northern Kanto area.

35
00:03:05,487 --> 00:03:07,653
The number of Homunculi,
the number of Familiars,

36
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:10,553
and the number of
Kakugane are all unknown.

37
00:03:10,587 --> 00:03:11,587
-That's no good.

38
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,487
-Just pathetic.

39
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,920
-Come on, give me a break!

40
00:03:13,953 --> 00:03:14,853
It's not even my fault!

41
00:03:14,887 --> 00:03:16,120
Ouka's just a maneater now!

42
00:03:16,153 --> 00:03:17,620
-But now we know
where their hideout

43
00:03:17,653 --> 00:03:21,953
is, a cottage in the forest on
the outskirts of Ginsei City.

44
00:03:21,987 --> 00:03:24,420
Ideally I'd want to bring
them down with bigger numbers

45
00:03:24,453 --> 00:03:27,120
to just get rid of them,
but we can't wait for that.

46
00:03:27,153 --> 00:03:28,887
It is possible that
the Traitor Warrior

47
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,153
could recover at any moment.

48
00:03:30,187 --> 00:03:32,953
-And before that happens, we
must defeat Dr. Butterfly!

49
00:03:32,987 --> 00:03:35,487
-The mission will
begin in 13 hours,

50
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,987
tomorrow morning at 8:00.

51
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:37,820
-I'll be ready.

52
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,787
-Uh, Captain Bravo?

53
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,053
Is that Kazuki gonna be OK?

54
00:04:00,087 --> 00:04:02,187
He's looking a little
stiff and nervous to me.

55
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,320
-I don't blame him.

56
00:04:03,353 --> 00:04:05,320
It's his first major battle.

57
00:04:05,353 --> 00:04:07,853
-Yes, but you know the
enemy won't take that

58
00:04:07,887 --> 00:04:09,753
into consideration.

59
00:04:09,787 --> 00:04:13,553
-But I believe that he is
worthy of being a Warrior.

60
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:15,420
Of that, I have no doubt.

61
00:04:18,253 --> 00:04:19,320
-All right, then.

62
00:04:19,353 --> 00:04:21,453
Let's take a look at
current global issues.

63
00:04:21,487 --> 00:04:22,787
-Aw, come on.

64
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:25,553
Isn't there anything more
interesting written in there?

65
00:04:25,587 --> 00:04:27,453
Hey, you're finally here.

66
00:04:27,487 --> 00:04:28,387
-You're really late.

67
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,553
What were you doing?

68
00:04:29,587 --> 00:04:30,453
-Yeah, he's right.

69
00:04:30,487 --> 00:04:33,053
What happened, Kazuki?

70
00:04:33,087 --> 00:04:34,253
-What are you guys doing?

71
00:04:34,287 --> 00:04:35,253
-What's it look like?

72
00:04:35,287 --> 00:04:36,653
Waiting for you is
what we're doing.

73
00:04:36,687 --> 00:04:38,820
-The hospital visit
went well, right?

74
00:04:38,853 --> 00:04:40,053
How is Ouka doing?

75
00:04:40,087 --> 00:04:41,820
-She's fine.

76
00:04:41,853 --> 00:04:43,620
Hey guys, how did
you know it was me?

77
00:04:43,653 --> 00:04:44,487
It's pretty dark.

78
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,820
How could you see my face?

79
00:04:45,853 --> 00:04:47,020
-Come on.

80
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:48,853
We've been hanging out
together since junior year.

81
00:04:48,887 --> 00:04:50,220
-You know better than that.

82
00:04:50,253 --> 00:04:52,553
-We don't have to see your
silly face in order for us

83
00:04:52,587 --> 00:04:55,720
to tell it's you.

84
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:58,620
-I guess not.

85
00:04:58,653 --> 00:05:02,120
BOY: So, Ouka is going to be
hospitalized a while longer,

86
00:05:02,153 --> 00:05:03,387
huh?

87
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:06,253
BOY: I wonder what Shisui
is gonna do about school?

88
00:05:06,287 --> 00:05:08,420
-You know, this
is like old times,

89
00:05:08,453 --> 00:05:11,187
when we used to hang out between
meals at the convenience store.

90
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,287
-Yeah, right after school,
back in junior high.

91
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:13,953
I remember.

92
00:05:13,987 --> 00:05:15,353
-That's true.

93
00:05:15,387 --> 00:05:17,287
But we haven't done it as much
since we started high school.

94
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,220
Especially lately.

95
00:05:18,253 --> 00:05:19,653
-That's because
a certain someone

96
00:05:19,687 --> 00:05:21,753
has been completely
obsessed with Tokiko lately.

97
00:05:21,787 --> 00:05:24,453
-I don't recall being
obsessed, but OK, OK.

98
00:05:24,487 --> 00:05:25,620
I'm really sorry.

99
00:05:25,653 --> 00:05:27,853
-Wow, spring break passed
by without us really

100
00:05:27,887 --> 00:05:29,587
doing anything together.

101
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,520
-Well, why don't we
make some definite plans

102
00:05:31,553 --> 00:05:32,487
for summer vacation?

103
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,187
-The beach!

104
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:33,987
Let's go to the beach!

105
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:34,853
-Sounds good!

106
00:05:34,887 --> 00:05:36,620
-All right, the beach it is!

107
00:05:36,653 --> 00:05:38,120
-And don't forget, Kazuki.

108
00:05:38,153 --> 00:05:40,220
Make sure you bring
Tokiko along with us.

109
00:05:40,253 --> 00:05:41,420
You got that?

110
00:05:41,453 --> 00:05:41,920
-OK.

111
00:05:44,587 --> 00:05:46,453
-It doesn't look like
we'll be able to avoid

112
00:05:46,487 --> 00:05:47,887
a decisive battle.

113
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,920
I'm going to have
you fight as well.

114
00:05:49,953 --> 00:05:51,187
-I'd be delighted to.

115
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:54,787
By the way, what about adding
Papillon to our forces?

116
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:57,820
I think he could be quite
useful, in his own way.

117
00:05:57,853 --> 00:05:58,687
-No.

118
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,887
He's no good.

119
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,453
-Oh, is that so?

120
00:06:01,487 --> 00:06:04,120
-He's a failure who
couldn't follow through,

121
00:06:04,153 --> 00:06:06,653
despite the fact he
used my research.

122
00:06:06,687 --> 00:06:09,353
He became an
incomplete Homunculus.

123
00:06:09,387 --> 00:06:11,953
He can't go on his
own-- because if he did,

124
00:06:11,987 --> 00:06:16,187
the Alchemist Warriors would
find him and just destroy him.

125
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:20,353
We both may be butterflies,
but he's a good for nothing

126
00:06:20,387 --> 00:06:23,453
who can't fly high
or go far by himself.

127
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:27,220
However, he is still, more
or less, a Homunculus,

128
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:30,187
so I am protecting him
as a matter of principle,

129
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,320
and nothing else.

130
00:06:36,487 --> 00:06:39,520
-So, I can't fly high
or go far by myself,

131
00:06:39,553 --> 00:06:42,087
huh, Great Grandfather?

132
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,587
Well, we're just going to
have to see about that.

133
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:46,087
Buso Renkin!

134
00:06:50,587 --> 00:06:59,420
[scream] It's been a long time.

135
00:06:59,453 --> 00:07:02,653
This feeling, the
excruciating pain.

136
00:07:02,687 --> 00:07:04,120
And this agony.

137
00:07:04,153 --> 00:07:08,720
I'd almost forgotten the ecstacy
of near death for a while.

138
00:07:08,753 --> 00:07:12,220
Thanks for protecting me until
now, dear Great Grandfather.

139
00:07:12,253 --> 00:07:14,820
As a sign of gratitude,
now I'll show you

140
00:07:14,853 --> 00:07:16,453
just how well I can really fly!

141
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,387
-Hey, morning, Mahiro.

142
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:22,787
Have you seen Kazuki?

143
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:23,887
-Hey, guys.

144
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,653
Actually, I haven't
seen him this morning.

145
00:07:25,687 --> 00:07:26,987
-Really?

146
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,753
Well anyway, listen, we were
thinking of going to the beach

147
00:07:28,787 --> 00:07:29,520
this summer.

148
00:07:29,553 --> 00:07:30,520
-I wanna go!

149
00:07:30,553 --> 00:07:31,453
Can I, can I?

150
00:07:31,487 --> 00:07:31,987
-Of course.

151
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:32,720
-All right!

152
00:07:32,753 --> 00:07:34,053
Yay!

153
00:07:34,087 --> 00:07:36,220
-Well, I checked out some
possible places on the internet

154
00:07:36,253 --> 00:07:37,287
last night.

155
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,120
Hey Mahiro, where's
Kazuki this morning?

156
00:07:59,887 --> 00:08:02,353
-By the way, Tokiko, do
you know how to swim?

157
00:08:02,387 --> 00:08:04,120
-What are you talking about?

158
00:08:04,153 --> 00:08:05,987
Are you making fun of me?

159
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:08,187
-Well, the guys were talking
about going to the beach

160
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,120
this summer.

161
00:08:09,153 --> 00:08:10,887
-Do we have to
talk about it now?

162
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:14,553
-Warrior Kazuki, you can
leave the driving to me.

163
00:08:14,587 --> 00:08:15,987
Oh, yeah!

164
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,953
-Roger that.

165
00:08:17,987 --> 00:08:19,020
-Warrior Chief--

166
00:08:19,053 --> 00:08:21,220
-But before that, we're
going to eliminate

167
00:08:21,253 --> 00:08:24,120
the scourge of alchemy that's
grown thick in this lab.

168
00:08:24,153 --> 00:08:25,753
-Hm?

169
00:08:25,787 --> 00:08:30,020
BRAVO: Deep inside this cottage
is Dr. Butterfly's laboratory.

170
00:08:30,053 --> 00:08:30,987
-All right.

171
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,120
We're ready!

172
00:08:32,153 --> 00:08:32,920
-Wait a minute!

173
00:08:32,953 --> 00:08:34,220
-What is it, Angel Gozen?

174
00:08:34,253 --> 00:08:36,520
-It's going to explode if
you don't unlock it properly

175
00:08:36,553 --> 00:08:39,553
by answering with
the correct password.

176
00:08:39,587 --> 00:08:40,820
MOONFACE: Give me the password.

177
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,287
-Don't worry, I'll tell
you guys the password.

178
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,053
And with the last
part of the password,

179
00:08:45,087 --> 00:08:48,453
it is very important that you
strike a cool, killer pose.

180
00:08:48,487 --> 00:08:49,187
-Strike a pose?

181
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,320
You kidding?

182
00:08:50,353 --> 00:08:51,987
No way I'll ever do a
silly thing like that.

183
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,220
-Let's do it, Tokiko!

184
00:08:53,253 --> 00:08:54,887
-Let's do it, Warrior Tokiko!

185
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,153
-Why are you two so into this?

186
00:08:56,187 --> 00:08:57,853
-What are you going to do?

187
00:08:57,887 --> 00:08:59,753
If we don't all do it,
it's not going to open.

188
00:08:59,787 --> 00:09:01,220
-Will you shut up?

189
00:09:01,253 --> 00:09:02,320
MOONFACE: In one hand--

190
00:09:02,353 --> 00:09:03,187
-A pistol.

191
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:03,753
-Wait!

192
00:09:03,787 --> 00:09:05,053
Don't start yet!

193
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:06,153
MOONFACE: In one's heart--

194
00:09:06,187 --> 00:09:07,953
-A boquet of flowers.

195
00:09:07,987 --> 00:09:10,553
Tokiko, please.

196
00:09:10,587 --> 00:09:11,987
MOONFACE: On one's lips--

197
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,420
-Liquor of fire.

198
00:09:13,453 --> 00:09:15,053
MOONFACE: On one's back--

199
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:16,920
-Now!

200
00:09:16,953 --> 00:09:17,420
Life!

201
00:09:17,453 --> 00:09:18,753
-Life!

202
00:09:18,787 --> 00:09:19,253
-Life!

203
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,720
-I guess opening the door
with the enemy outside

204
00:09:30,753 --> 00:09:31,953
would have been pretty stupid.

205
00:09:31,987 --> 00:09:32,653
-Hm.

206
00:09:32,687 --> 00:09:33,987
Very true, Bravo.

207
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:36,220
-They'd better not think
they can get away that easily

208
00:09:36,253 --> 00:09:38,487
after making a fool out of me.

209
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,620
Buso Renkin!

210
00:09:40,653 --> 00:09:41,120
Let's go!

211
00:09:43,953 --> 00:09:45,120
Warrior Chief!

212
00:09:45,153 --> 00:09:46,353
-Yes.

213
00:09:46,387 --> 00:09:48,153
I'd heard they ley down
their guard during the day,

214
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:50,287
but it is strange that we
haven't encountered anyone

215
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,287
as well.

216
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,720
-Over here, Kazuki!

217
00:09:52,753 --> 00:09:53,220
Come on!

218
00:09:53,253 --> 00:09:53,987
-Let's go!

219
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:54,687
Sunlight Slasher!

220
00:10:02,487 --> 00:10:05,487
-So, this is the lowest
level of the LXE hideout.

221
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,287
-That means this is Dr.
Butterfly's laboratory.

222
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,087
[shouting]

223
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,920
-What's the matter, Angel Gozen?

224
00:10:10,953 --> 00:10:11,720
-It's gone!

225
00:10:11,753 --> 00:10:12,720
-Hat are you talking about?

226
00:10:12,753 --> 00:10:14,353
-The heart of the laboratory!

227
00:10:14,387 --> 00:10:14,853
The tank!

228
00:10:14,887 --> 00:10:17,820
It's gone!

229
00:10:17,853 --> 00:10:21,820
-That is because his body
is almost fully restored.

230
00:10:21,853 --> 00:10:24,520
Now all he needs to do is
feed, and he will resurrect.

231
00:10:24,553 --> 00:10:28,253
Which is why Dr. Butterfly
has taken the body with him.

232
00:10:28,287 --> 00:10:30,353
-Are you a humanoid Homunculus?

233
00:10:30,387 --> 00:10:31,320
-Course I am.

234
00:10:31,353 --> 00:10:33,720
My name used to be
Lunare Nikolaev.

235
00:10:33,753 --> 00:10:38,620
Now I'm Moonface, and this
is my precious Buso Renkin.

236
00:10:38,653 --> 00:10:39,753
-Where's Dr. Butterfly?

237
00:10:39,787 --> 00:10:40,920
Where did he go?

238
00:10:40,953 --> 00:10:43,053
-That's a pretty easy
quiz, don't you think?

239
00:10:43,087 --> 00:10:45,453
There is a nearby place
filled with young life,

240
00:10:45,487 --> 00:10:46,987
and that place is--

241
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:47,553
-Oh, no.

242
00:10:47,587 --> 00:10:48,353
Don't tell me.

243
00:10:48,387 --> 00:10:50,120
-Ginsei Academy?

244
00:10:50,153 --> 00:10:52,853
-That's correct.

245
00:10:52,887 --> 00:10:55,653
-Direct Hit, Bravo Punch!

246
00:10:55,687 --> 00:10:56,553
-Let's hurry.

247
00:10:56,587 --> 00:10:57,520
Everyone's in danger.

248
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,487
-Moon.

249
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,020
If you ask me, I
think it's a joke

250
00:11:04,053 --> 00:11:06,953
to send inexperienced kids
to a battle like this.

251
00:11:06,987 --> 00:11:10,053
-Trust me, you don't
have to worry about them.

252
00:11:10,087 --> 00:11:12,387
I just need to take down
the one enemy left here,

253
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,720
and then go join 'em.

254
00:11:13,753 --> 00:11:16,653
And that'll be taken care
of with one swift attack.

255
00:11:16,687 --> 00:11:17,820
-Moon!

256
00:11:17,853 --> 00:11:18,987
I suppose.

257
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:22,120
However, that's if there's
only one of me left.

258
00:11:22,153 --> 00:11:24,220
-Huh?

259
00:11:24,253 --> 00:11:26,220
-Oh, please let us
make it in time.

260
00:11:26,253 --> 00:11:28,320
I hope everyone's safe!

261
00:11:28,353 --> 00:11:29,187
-Whoa, whoa, whoa!

262
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,920
What's that up ahead?

263
00:11:31,953 --> 00:11:32,920
-Hey!

264
00:11:32,953 --> 00:11:36,287
That's coming from the school.

265
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,120
BOY: Where's it coming from?

266
00:11:38,153 --> 00:11:39,187
-Did you guys see?

267
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,687
There's a ton of fog outside.

268
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,787
-I can't see outside
the school at all.

269
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:43,687
-All right, everyone.

270
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,887
Get back to class right away.

271
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,253
-What's wrong with
my cell phone?

272
00:11:46,287 --> 00:11:47,087
It's not working.

273
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,353
-Neither is mine.

274
00:11:48,387 --> 00:11:49,720
-Quiet down.

275
00:11:49,753 --> 00:11:52,153
The teachers are trying to find
out what's going on outside.

276
00:11:52,187 --> 00:11:55,387
So in the meantime,
let's just remain calm.

277
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:59,920
Mr. Takagishi,
what's the matter?

278
00:11:59,953 --> 00:12:01,587
-There's no way out.

279
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,920
-Huh?

280
00:12:02,953 --> 00:12:05,820
-I was heading to the school
gate, but before I knew it,

281
00:12:05,853 --> 00:12:07,953
I ended up back where I started.

282
00:12:07,987 --> 00:12:09,653
It's like being lost in a maze.

283
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:10,987
This fog isn't natural.

284
00:12:13,853 --> 00:12:15,987
-Hey guys, is my
brother here yet?

285
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:16,987
-No.

286
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,553
Neither he nor
Tokiko have come yet.

287
00:12:18,587 --> 00:12:19,753
-Something isn't right.

288
00:12:19,787 --> 00:12:22,420
I think it'd be better
if you stay here with us.

289
00:12:22,453 --> 00:12:23,687
-OK.

290
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,520
But I'm just gonna go get
Chii-chin and Sally first.

291
00:12:25,553 --> 00:12:26,053
-Hey!

292
00:12:26,087 --> 00:12:27,187
What's that?

293
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:30,220
There's something strange
in the schoolyard.

294
00:12:30,253 --> 00:12:34,220
[frightened conversations]

295
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,007
MAN: My GPS isn't working!

296
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,973
-What's going on with
the traffic light?

297
00:12:47,007 --> 00:12:48,107
-I had the right
of way, you idiot!

298
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:48,607
-Whoa!

299
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,540
Look out!

00:12:49,573 --> 00:12:50,773
[whistle]

00:12:50,807 --> 00:12:51,540
-Chief!

302
00:12:51,573 --> 00:12:52,240
-Hey!

303
00:12:52,273 --> 00:12:54,073
So how did it go?

304
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:55,973
-Actually, no.

305
00:12:56,007 --> 00:12:58,440
No matter what I do, I
can't seem to get past here.

306
00:12:58,473 --> 00:12:59,573
-I don't understand.

307
00:12:59,607 --> 00:13:00,940
What's up ahead, anyway?

308
00:13:00,973 --> 00:13:04,073
-If I remember correctly, it's
the Ginesei Private Academy.

309
00:13:04,107 --> 00:13:05,807
-Tokiko, this fog it's--

310
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,940
-You noticed the
strangeness of it, too.

311
00:13:07,973 --> 00:13:09,107
Stay sharp.

312
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,573
If you look really
carefully, there

313
00:13:10,607 --> 00:13:12,540
are metal particles
mixed in with it.

314
00:13:12,573 --> 00:13:15,273
This is a Buso Renkin.

315
00:13:15,307 --> 00:13:19,140
The special property throws off
peoples' sense of direction,

316
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:22,240
and isolates what's inside of
the fog from what's outside.

317
00:13:22,273 --> 00:13:23,040
-Dammit.

318
00:13:23,073 --> 00:13:24,507
Which way?

319
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,207
ANGEL GOZEN: This way, Kazuki!

320
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:26,973
-Angel Gozen?

321
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:28,340
You know the way?

322
00:13:28,373 --> 00:13:30,940
-My angel eyes are clear,
and can see far and wide.

323
00:13:30,973 --> 00:13:31,907
Come on, let's go.

324
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:32,873
Quick, follow me!

325
00:13:32,907 --> 00:13:33,873
-OK!

326
00:13:33,907 --> 00:13:34,907
-Listen to me, Kazuki.

327
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,673
Make sure you cover your face.

328
00:13:36,707 --> 00:13:39,040
It wouldn't be a good thing
if the students at the school

329
00:13:39,073 --> 00:13:40,140
were able to recognize you.

330
00:13:40,173 --> 00:13:40,973
-Sure.

331
00:13:41,007 --> 00:13:43,007
But what about you, Tokiko?

332
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,540
-With my long hair and
this fog, I should be OK.

333
00:13:45,573 --> 00:13:47,973
But the problem is this uniform.

334
00:13:48,007 --> 00:13:49,973
-Got it.

335
00:13:50,007 --> 00:13:51,273
-OK, here they are.

336
00:13:51,307 --> 00:13:52,640
-Good.

337
00:13:52,673 --> 00:13:55,040
Uh, Mappy, are you sure that
we can leave class like this?

338
00:13:55,073 --> 00:13:56,173
-Don't worry about it.

339
00:13:56,207 --> 00:13:57,707
The teachers haven't
been able to do

340
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,473
anything about this
situation anyway.

341
00:13:59,507 --> 00:14:02,240
-And no matter what happens,
we're here to protect you.

342
00:14:02,273 --> 00:14:03,373
So no worries.

343
00:14:03,407 --> 00:14:04,707
-To be honest, I am scared.

344
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:07,173
But we should at least be able
to buy some time to escape.

345
00:14:07,207 --> 00:14:11,207
-Hey, those things in the
schoolyard started moving!

346
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:11,907
GIRL: Oh, no!

347
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:12,773
They're coming this way!

348
00:14:12,807 --> 00:14:16,740
-What the hell are those things?

349
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:18,240
[roar]

350
00:14:18,273 --> 00:14:20,240
-Feed us!

351
00:14:20,273 --> 00:14:22,707
[screaming]

352
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,707
-We've gotta get out of here!

353
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:29,707
-Run!

354
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:30,707
-Run, everybody!

355
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,140
-The revised humanoid Homunculi.

356
00:14:38,173 --> 00:14:41,107
I set out to create
Homunculi that

357
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:43,773
can fight Alchemist Warriors.

358
00:14:43,807 --> 00:14:45,807
Even without Buso Renkin.

359
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:49,740
As I thought, they are
still far inferior to you.

360
00:14:49,773 --> 00:14:53,173
Nevertheless, I do take
pride in having completed

361
00:14:53,207 --> 00:14:59,440
a very good specimen, with
pretty decent combat abilities.

362
00:14:59,473 --> 00:15:01,407
-Feed me!

363
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,140
[screaming]

364
00:15:04,173 --> 00:15:05,007
-Feed me!

365
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:05,540
-Buso Renkin!

366
00:15:13,107 --> 00:15:15,040
-We made it just in time.

367
00:15:15,073 --> 00:15:17,373
-So, the Alchemist Warriors
have finally appeared.

368
00:15:20,373 --> 00:15:22,407
-Here we come, you monsters!

369
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,807
-There's no way I'll let you
get any closer to the school

370
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,240
building!

371
00:15:28,773 --> 00:15:30,207
[shout]

372
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,173
-What?

373
00:15:31,207 --> 00:15:32,607
-Are they fighting the monsters?

374
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,140
-Who are those two?

375
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:42,540
[shout]

376
00:15:42,573 --> 00:15:43,473
BOY: Wait!

377
00:15:43,507 --> 00:15:44,540
Are they all
fighting each other?

378
00:15:44,573 --> 00:15:45,340
BOY: No.

379
00:15:45,373 --> 00:15:45,873
Just two of them look human.

380
00:15:51,007 --> 00:15:52,173
-Huh?

381
00:15:52,207 --> 00:15:54,740
-But to think they can
fight those monsters.

382
00:15:54,773 --> 00:15:56,473
-Are those two human?

383
00:15:56,507 --> 00:15:57,240
-No!

384
00:15:57,273 --> 00:15:58,340
Actually, those two are--

385
00:15:58,373 --> 00:15:59,173
INTERCOM: Monsters.

386
00:15:59,207 --> 00:16:00,173
-Huh?

387
00:16:00,207 --> 00:16:02,173
-Monsters are
attacking the academy.

388
00:16:02,207 --> 00:16:04,540
Let's all work together
and protect the school.

389
00:16:04,573 --> 00:16:07,807
This is Student Council
Secretary and Proxy President

390
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,273
Suzuki Shinyo speaking to you.

391
00:16:09,307 --> 00:16:12,840
The school currently has no
contact with the outside world.

392
00:16:12,873 --> 00:16:14,873
We've been completely cut off.

393
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:17,640
Until help arrives, we must
not let the monsters fighting

394
00:16:17,673 --> 00:16:19,340
outside approach
the school building.

395
00:16:21,907 --> 00:16:23,740
-Are all of them
really monsters?

396
00:16:23,773 --> 00:16:26,040
-Shut up, you idiot.

397
00:16:26,073 --> 00:16:26,673
-All right.

398
00:16:26,707 --> 00:16:27,907
Okakura, Daihama.

399
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:28,907
-I'm ready.

400
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:29,907
-Let's go!

401
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,307
INTERCOM: They're all monsters.

402
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,540
Whether or not they have
taken on human form,

403
00:16:33,573 --> 00:16:35,840
all of them in the
schoolyard are monsters.

404
00:16:35,873 --> 00:16:38,307
Do not let them
in, no matter what!

405
00:16:42,573 --> 00:16:43,073
-No!

406
00:16:43,107 --> 00:16:44,173
-Chii-chin?

407
00:16:44,207 --> 00:16:45,407
-They're monsters, just
like that last time!

408
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,173
They look human, but
they're monsters!

409
00:16:47,207 --> 00:16:47,707
All of them!

410
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:48,373
All of them!

411
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:49,340
-Oh, Chii-chin!

412
00:16:49,373 --> 00:16:50,707
-Just hang in there!

413
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,173
BOY: What's going on down there?

414
00:16:52,207 --> 00:16:53,207
Look at the size of them!

415
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,007
It's huge!

416
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,440
INTERCOM: Everyone's help
is absolutely necessary

417
00:16:57,473 --> 00:16:59,173
to protect the school
from the monsters.

418
00:16:59,207 --> 00:17:00,607
Let's show them our strength.

419
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:05,073
We'll all protect
the school together.

420
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:08,440
-BOY: Stay away!

421
00:17:08,473 --> 00:17:09,840
Get out, monster!

422
00:17:09,873 --> 00:17:11,273
-Stay back!

423
00:17:11,307 --> 00:17:11,840
-Yeah!

424
00:17:11,873 --> 00:17:12,840
-Get outta here!

425
00:17:12,873 --> 00:17:15,873
BOY: We'll fight
together to get you out!

426
00:17:15,907 --> 00:17:17,073
-What are you doing?

427
00:17:17,107 --> 00:17:19,040
They're risking their lives
to protect all you guys!

428
00:17:19,073 --> 00:17:20,907
KAZUKI: It's OK, Angel Gozen.

429
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,107
-Huh?

430
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:24,440
-This isn't the time to
convince them who we are.

431
00:17:24,473 --> 00:17:26,240
-He's absolutely right.

432
00:17:26,273 --> 00:17:28,907
This is the time to fight.

433
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,807
-Oh, Kazuki.

434
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:34,040
-Show your defiance and
your will to resist.

435
00:17:34,073 --> 00:17:37,173
Bags, notebooks, desks, chairs.

436
00:17:37,207 --> 00:17:38,940
They may not be
much individually,

437
00:17:38,973 --> 00:17:40,673
but they will
certainly chip away

438
00:17:40,707 --> 00:17:43,573
at the monsters' will to fight.

439
00:17:43,607 --> 00:17:46,407
Let's all work
together, and fight out

440
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,740
those horrible monsters!

441
00:17:48,773 --> 00:17:51,073
Heh, heh, heh.

442
00:17:51,107 --> 00:17:51,907
-Ha.

443
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:54,040
Attacking with backdoor tactics.

444
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,873
Clever idea, Familiar Suzuki.

445
00:17:56,907 --> 00:17:59,173
This attack should
make a deep impression

446
00:17:59,207 --> 00:18:04,040
on this greenhorn still
wet behind the ears.

447
00:18:04,073 --> 00:18:05,473
-Kazuki!

448
00:18:05,507 --> 00:18:07,140
-Dammit!

449
00:18:07,173 --> 00:18:08,440
SUZUKI: One of them is injured.

450
00:18:08,473 --> 00:18:09,373
Get him!

451
00:18:09,407 --> 00:18:13,173
-I've-- I've gotta
get it together.

452
00:18:13,207 --> 00:18:14,373
-Kazuki!

453
00:18:14,407 --> 00:18:16,107
SUZUKI: Everyone, we need
to beat those monsters

454
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:19,207
down at once!

455
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,173
-Dammit, it won't open.

456
00:18:20,207 --> 00:18:22,507
-It must be locked
from the inside.

457
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,607
-Daihama, why don't
you give it a try?

458
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,207
-I don't know.

459
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:25,707
Let's see.

460
00:18:29,073 --> 00:18:30,473
-Daihama?

461
00:18:30,507 --> 00:18:31,173
-Moron!

462
00:18:31,207 --> 00:18:32,373
Quit talking nonsense!

463
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,740
-What do you mean, nonsense?

464
00:18:37,773 --> 00:18:39,607
I'm doing this
broadcast to protect

465
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,907
the school from the monsters.

466
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:42,173
I'm just serving the students.

467
00:18:42,207 --> 00:18:43,073
That's all.

468
00:18:43,107 --> 00:18:44,073
-You're an idiot.

469
00:18:44,107 --> 00:18:44,707
-Huh?

470
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:45,840
-Listen, Suzuki.

471
00:18:45,873 --> 00:18:47,640
The problem is you're
assuming that everything

472
00:18:47,673 --> 00:18:49,673
in the schoolyard is
a monster or an enemy,

473
00:18:49,707 --> 00:18:51,973
and you're broadcasting
that as true.

474
00:18:52,007 --> 00:18:54,273
But aren't the two who
came later and began

475
00:18:54,307 --> 00:18:59,107
fighting the monsters humans,
just like the rest of us?

476
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,040
-Rokumasu?

477
00:19:00,073 --> 00:19:01,173
SUZUKI: There is
absolutely no way

478
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:03,140
in the world ordinary
humans could fight

479
00:19:03,173 --> 00:19:07,373
at even terms against such
a huge army of monsters.

480
00:19:07,407 --> 00:19:09,807
-Try using your common sense.

481
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,507
-Can't you see that
common sense doesn't

482
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:13,173
apply in a situation like this?

483
00:19:13,207 --> 00:19:14,440
-Huh?

484
00:19:14,473 --> 00:19:16,707
-Does this situation seem
normal to you, Suzuki?

485
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,973
-It doesn't really
matter, since none of us

486
00:19:19,007 --> 00:19:20,573
know who those individuals are.

487
00:19:20,607 --> 00:19:22,207
I still think it's
very dangerous

488
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,673
to assume that they are
on our side, don't you?

489
00:19:24,707 --> 00:19:26,540
-Well, we happen to
know who they are.

490
00:19:26,573 --> 00:19:27,807
-Those two people out there--

491
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,073
- --are our very good friends.

492
00:19:33,507 --> 00:19:35,940
SUZUKI: Talk about being
driven by distress.

493
00:19:35,973 --> 00:19:36,840
Friends?

494
00:19:36,873 --> 00:19:38,107
On what basis?

495
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:40,140
We can't even see their
faces in this fog.

496
00:19:40,173 --> 00:19:41,607
And not to mention
that one of them

497
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,240
is clearly trying to
conceal his identity.

498
00:19:44,273 --> 00:19:45,473
-We know who he is.

499
00:19:45,507 --> 00:19:47,273
-Even if we can't
see his moronic face.

500
00:19:47,307 --> 00:19:48,807
-We can recognize him.

501
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,807
ROKUMASU: The ones fighting
out there are our friends.

502
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,973
They are friends--

503
00:19:53,007 --> 00:19:54,040
TOGETHER: To us all!

504
00:20:01,373 --> 00:20:03,740
-That's right, you fool!

505
00:20:03,773 --> 00:20:05,173
-Huh?

506
00:20:05,207 --> 00:20:07,373
-That fool out there
is such an idiot!

507
00:20:07,407 --> 00:20:09,573
He's gone so far as to save
the life of an enemy who

508
00:20:09,607 --> 00:20:10,607
even tried to kill him!

509
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,673
He's not stupid!

510
00:20:11,707 --> 00:20:14,940
A super, duper, ultra,
mega huge idiot.

511
00:20:14,973 --> 00:20:17,573
But idiot or not,
there's no way a nice guy

512
00:20:17,607 --> 00:20:19,340
like him would try to
hurt you, you morons.

513
00:20:19,373 --> 00:20:20,173
Can't you see that?

514
00:20:20,207 --> 00:20:21,607
Can't you see that?

515
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,807
-Angel Gozen?

516
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,507
What are you doing here?

517
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:27,340
-Huh?

518
00:20:27,373 --> 00:20:29,207
ROKUMASU: We heard that, Suzuki.

519
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,173
So tell us.

520
00:20:30,207 --> 00:20:32,473
How do you know
this intruder here?

521
00:20:32,507 --> 00:20:33,973
SUZUKI: Uh, well--

522
00:20:34,007 --> 00:20:34,640
What's going on?

523
00:20:34,673 --> 00:20:36,073
What's happening?

524
00:20:36,107 --> 00:20:38,073
- --our friends or our foes?

525
00:20:38,107 --> 00:20:40,273
-So are the two in the
schoolyard on our side or not?

526
00:20:40,307 --> 00:20:43,640
-Could those two be--

527
00:20:43,673 --> 00:20:46,040
-Get out of the way!

528
00:20:46,073 --> 00:20:47,007
-Get up, Chii-chin!

529
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,440
We have to get out of here!

530
00:20:48,473 --> 00:20:49,440
-I can't.

531
00:20:49,473 --> 00:20:51,340
I'm so scared I
can't move from here.

532
00:20:51,373 --> 00:20:52,107
Run, Sally.

533
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:52,840
Just run away.

534
00:20:52,873 --> 00:20:53,340
-Chii-chin!

535
00:21:05,207 --> 00:21:05,673
Oh, no!

-It's all right.

538
00:21:07,907 --> 00:21:08,840
I just remembered.

539
00:21:08,873 --> 00:21:10,840
I mentioned it to
you guys before.

540
00:21:10,873 --> 00:21:12,140
A nightmare.

541
00:21:12,173 --> 00:21:15,307
A nightmare a lot like this
that I had around the time

542
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,273
when I first started school.

543
00:21:17,307 --> 00:21:19,807
I see now that it
wasn't a dream.

544
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,007
It really happened.

545
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,973
And in the end, my brother
appeared and saved me.

546
00:21:23,007 --> 00:21:24,840
-I'm gonna eat you.

547
00:21:24,873 --> 00:21:27,640
-I have no doubt he'll come
and protect us this time too,

548
00:21:27,673 --> 00:21:33,173
because this time, he'll
be here for all of us.

549
00:21:33,207 --> 00:21:34,673
I'm sure.

550
00:21:34,707 --> 00:21:36,173
He'll protect everyone!
