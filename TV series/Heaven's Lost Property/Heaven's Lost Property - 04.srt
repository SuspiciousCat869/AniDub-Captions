1
00:00:36,458 --> 00:00:38,541
The weather looks great today.

2
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:42,750
Man, I love peace and quiet.

3
00:00:55,416 --> 00:00:57,583
What the Hell?!

4
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:34,708
Why hello, everyone.
My name is Eishirou Sugata.

5
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:38,083
And this here is my
assistant, Pretty the Second.

6
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:41,541
Beginning around the
year of twelve eighty...

7
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:43,583
and continuing
for many decades,

8
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:46,208
the world saw a
drastic surge in trade.

9
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:49,500
The invention of the magnetic
compass made this possible.

10
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:52,958
However, before the
compass was widely in use,

11
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:55,750
mariners depended upon
migrating birds and fish

12
00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:58,416
to determine
ideal sailing routes.

13
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:03,708
Explorers tracked these animals
to discover the New World.

14
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:07,416
There is an immeasurable level
of potential in the magnetic

15
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,750
compasses of animals.
Go on, Pretty!

16
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:14,500
Use that internal compass of
yours to show me the New World!

17
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:20,583
Perhaps I would've
been better off

18
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:23,208
just cooking her
for dinner instead.

19
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,500
Damn! Why am I
buried in panties again?

20
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:34,458
I do not know. Perhaps they're
similar to migratory birds.

21
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:35,791
Oh, come on.

22
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:41,000
Wait a minute...

23
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:49,208
Are you tellin' me all the
panties from before came back?

24
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:52,125
Yes. In fact, I believe
they circumnavigated

25
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:53,791
the entire globe already.

26
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:55,291
Wha--?! No way!

27
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,125
It's possible they just
wanted to see you, Master,

28
00:03:58,208 --> 00:03:59,666
so they came back to visit.

29
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:04,250
Crazy. You came all the
way back here just to see me?

30
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:12,791
You guys!

31
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:16,833
Tomo, I am gonna...

32
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:18,375
Oh god! I better
start runnin'...

33
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,083
Kill! You!

34
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:23,375
What are all my
panties doing here?!

35
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:26,250
Why are they in your room?

36
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:30,083
You're such a
pervert, Tomo! A pervert!

37
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:41,375
It's so... It's so
horrible! Look, Sohara!

38
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:43,333
Look at all
this lifeless fabric!

39
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:45,875
They could've had bright futures
ahead of them, but no...

40
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:47,208
you had to ruin it!

41
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:49,916
That's not it, Master.
The effect of the card has

42
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,416
simply worn off again.

43
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,916
Anyway! Every single one of
'em better go in the trash!

44
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,833
I'm starting to get sick
and tired of this foolishness.

45
00:04:57,916 --> 00:04:59,541
Sure! You got it!

46
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:01,916
Tomoki. If I leave it to you

47
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,291
you'll end up
sniffing every last pair!

48
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:09,000
I know! Hey, Ikaros...

49
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:13,625
Yes, Miss, it's right there.

50
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,875
Score!

51
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:20,208
What? They came back?

52
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:23,166
Yeah. When I woke up this
morning, the whole flock

53
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,333
of panties came
flying into my room.

54
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:29,000
That's very interesting.
You know the New World was

55
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:31,333
discovered by
tracking migratory birds.

56
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:33,583
If we call the trajectory...

57
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,125
Did I hear right? Something
about having a huge mound

58
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:39,375
of panties lying around
your house right now?

59
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:40,791
Uh, yeah.

60
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:43,541
Let me see if I've got these
sordid details straight.

61
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:46,375
An innocent teenager has
both used and unused panties

62
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:49,458
flying around his bedroom like
it's some perverse wonderland?

63
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:50,958
Well, they're
not flying anymore!

64
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:53,083
What about the
pair Sohara was wearing?

65
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:55,541
Are they included in
there as well, Tomoki?

66
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:59,791
Well, you are a guy, so I guess
I shouldn't act surprised...

67
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:02,541
That's all I got. No
more questions from me.

68
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,500
Tomo. Damn it, you better
promise you'll throw them out

69
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:06,958
as soon as you get back home!

70
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:09,833
Right! I'm on it!

71
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:12,041
I don't think I can
ever trust him again!

72
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:17,625
Hey, Tomoki! Have you gotten
rid of those panties yet?

73
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:21,833
Hello? Tomo? Are
you even listening?

74
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:23,791
Yeah... Taken care of!

75
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:26,208
Good. Thank you.

76
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:29,833
As if I'd ever throw 'em out!

77
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:31,708
I'm a growing,
maturing teenager!

78
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:34,250
I have needs! I'd be
a fool to part ways with

79
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:37,875
such a treasure-trove. It's like
my own personal holy grail!

80
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:48,500
What the Hell was that?!

81
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:52,833
Oh lovely. You liar. You
didn't get rid of any of 'em.

82
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:54,291
Sohara!

83
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:55,916
Ikaros here was kind enough
to give me a special card

84
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,041
of my own.
She's on my side now.

85
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:02,250
The panties
will now... explode.

86
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:03,541
Huh?!

87
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:05,291
Let me break it down
for ya. If you so much as

88
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:08,125
look at a pair of panties,
they'll blow up in your face.

89
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:09,375
Is that what just happened?!

90
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:11,750
Exactly. I was hoping
it'd make you less of a

91
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:13,583
perverted freak show.

92
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,250
Don't worry, it only affects
panties within your vicinity,

93
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:18,958
and it's just for one day.

94
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:20,833
Judging by the
size of that explosion,

95
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:24,041
I bet you didn't throw out a
single pair, you big fat liar.

96
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:29,375
Ikaros and I are gonna treat
ourselves to a girl's day out.

97
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:31,541
So even though I won't
be here to witness it,

98
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:34,708
have fun movin'
around the house! Bye!

99
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:36,083
Sohara, wait!

100
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:38,166
Feeling some regret?

101
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:41,333
No. It's just there's um...

102
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:43,833
A really big bug
crawling on your wall.

103
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:48,166
 No way! Where? Where is it?

104
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:52,583
Tomoki! C'mon, help
me out, where is it?

105
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,041
Dumbass. You thought I wouldn't
be able to see your panties

106
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:02,625
under the windowsill,
but you always get dressed

107
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:04,583
with your window open.

108
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:06,416
All of that peeping paid off!

109
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,250
You jerk! You're such
a perv. I hate you!

110
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:10,791
I hope you burn alive today!

111
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:15,833
'Kay... Let's get
a move on, Ikaros.

112
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:17,666
One moment... Master is not...

113
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:21,291
Don't worry about him.
He's on his own today.

114
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:24,750
I gotta be careful.
If I see any panties today

115
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:28,041
they'll turn into bombs and
blow my ass to smithereens!

116
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:32,583
Damn you, Sohara! I'm becoming
a man, so of course I wanna

117
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:35,000
fondle 'em and
smell 'em and wear 'em!

118
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:38,041
Anyway, I gotta find
a way outta here, ASAP.

119
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:44,666
I forgot. I hung all
of them up yesterday.

120
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:54,333
This is bad. I'm gonna
die if this keeps up!

121
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:58,416
I gotta find a way
outta here, and fast! Wait...

122
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:02,000
If I don't look at them,
they can't explode, right?

123
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:06,291
Oh man, this'll be
easier than I thought.

124
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:11,208
I mean, this is my own house, so
I just gotta feel my way around.

125
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:14,458
Okay, down the stairs.
Get to the ground floor...

126
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:22,541
Oh, that's crap! I can't touch
them either?! Hell with it!

127
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:24,166
I'll just jump
out of the window!

128
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:34,166
Aw, lame! I hung 'em
all over the yard yesterday

129
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:36,291
'cause I was feeling
all Christmassy!

130
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:48,250
Fine then. Guess I'll
retreat to the bathroom

131
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:49,833
and catch my breath.

132
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:56,291
Aw... Son of a--

133
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:09,458
Something wrong?

134
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:12,416
I have the feeling
Master is in danger.

135
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,458
So?! Screw that guy,
he needs to be taught

136
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:16,208
a long overdue lesson.

137
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:21,958
No way! Those are adorable!

138
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:25,458
Oh, look! They have
angel wings on them!

139
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,666
I bet they'd
look perfect on you!

140
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,375
Wait a second... I bet
you're still wearing that same

141
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:34,458
cheap-ass pair of panties
Tomoki bought for you

142
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:36,416
at the convenience
store, right?

143
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:39,708
Look, I'm sorry, girl,
that's not gonna fly.

144
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:41,958
You can't depend on
that perverted mind of his.

145
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,375
Good thing I'm here to help.

146
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:47,291
I'll pick out some cute
ones for ya! Think of them as

147
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:50,250
a present from me to you,
to thank you for the card.

148
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:01,250
It's cute and it fits great!

149
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:07,541
So tell me a
little about yourself.

150
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:10,500
Is this the first time you've
ever been someplace like this?

151
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:13,416
What do you do for fun?
Have you ever been shopping

152
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,958
with your friends before?

153
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,791
With my friends?

154
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:23,208
I don't... have friends.

155
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:32,291
Oh, I see...
Ikaros... I... I, um...

156
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:35,833
I'm sorry for asking
such weird questions...

157
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:37,625
I remember when
I first moved here...

158
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:40,000
I felt totally
alone in the world...

159
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:42,916
So I really do
understand how you must feel.

160
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:48,125
Back then... my body
was really weak and...

161
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:52,333
I had to stay indoors
all the time... So, uh...

162
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:55,291
Tomoki, who lived next
door, we became close friends.

163
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:57,541
We were always
there for each other.

164
00:11:57,625 --> 00:12:00,416
Sure, he'd bring me worms
and raid my family's fridge,

165
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:04,291
just like any typical boy.
Sounds like him, right?

166
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:08,708
But I remember one
birthday, he was real sweet.

167
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:20,250
Something wrong, sweetheart?

168
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:22,250
What are you
standing out here for?

169
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:24,750
I thought when it was
your birthday... a bunch of

170
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:27,166
your friends were supposed
to come over to your house

171
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,958
for a party and
have cake and ice cream.

172
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:35,791
Today's my birthday but
no one came to my party.

173
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:37,416
I'm all alone.

174
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:46,625
Oh hey.

175
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:47,625
Tomoki.

176
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:49,875
This is... real good!

177
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:53,375
Hold on... That looks familiar.
Is that the birthday cake

178
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:55,375
my mom bought for me?

179
00:12:56,541 --> 00:13:01,958
Happy birthday. And look,
Sohara! I got a present for ya.

180
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:04,125
My grandpa gave
it to me yesterday.

181
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:05,875
It's an orange tree seed.

182
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:08,083
If you plant it, your
family will be able to

183
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:12,500
eat oranges every year!
Cool, huh? Do you like it?

184
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,708
Yeah.

185
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:28,375
Sure brings back memories. He
may act like an immature brat,

186
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:31,208
but he's one of the
few who understands...

187
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:35,041
just how other people
feel. He's nice like that.

188
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:37,375
It may come as a surprise,
but you can really count on him

189
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:39,250
when it truly matters.

190
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,791
But don't get me wrong.

191
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:43,875
Ninety-nine percent of
the time he's just a creep.

192
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,708
He prob'ly won't say
anything to you about it...

193
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:52,041
but I'm pretty sure
he cares about you, too.

194
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:57,375
And you know,
you do have friends.

195
00:13:57,458 --> 00:14:01,375
Just know you're
not alone, Ikaros. Okay?

196
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:08,750
Master is in serious danger.

197
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:13,250
All right. I'm starting
to get worried myself.

198
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:15,250
Let's head back to the house.

199
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:23,708
Screw it! Make a run for the
door and hope for the best!

200
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:42,208
Just a little further!
Almost there!

201
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:50,125
No... Oh god, no!

202
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:56,208
No!

203
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:12,416
What... happened?

204
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,375
Are you okay?

205
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:15,333
Pull yourself together, Tomoki.

206
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:18,541
What are you... doing here?

207
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:21,500
Ikaros informed us of
what happened. We came to

208
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:24,583
check up on the status
of the panty situation.

209
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:26,500
I never would
have expected this.

210
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:28,708
Looks like you've
been through Hell.

211
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:33,583
I guess... I finally
made it out of the house...

212
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,500
Hell! Yeah!

213
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:39,416
Hang on... Where's Sohara?

214
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,541
She's inside of the house.

215
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:43,750
It looks as though the
explosion caused her...

216
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:46,375
to be thrown
back into the house.

217
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:48,208
That's crazy!

218
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:53,583
It's all my fault. None of
this would've happened if

219
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:56,291
I hadn't landed face
first in her crotch.

220
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:59,000
You know what to do,
Tomoki. You're the only one

221
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:02,583
capable of saving Sohara from
the danger that awaits her.

222
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:04,250
Ma'am...

223
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,708
Take this.

224
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,958
Whoa! What the...?

225
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:13,583
It's one of those times...
when a man stands up and fights.

226
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:15,500
Now get in there
and bring an end to

227
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:17,541
this deviant funhouse
you've created.

228
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:20,583
That is, of course, if you're
man enough for the job.

229
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,375
Oh, I am on this.

230
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:33,583
Sergeant Tomoki.
Ready for battle!

231
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:39,333
Wait for me, Sohara!

232
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:40,875
Master.

233
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,208
Now you do realize you could
send anyone other than Tomoki

234
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:45,125
in there and the
panties would never explode.

235
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:48,208
Oh yes, Sugata, I'm
well aware of that fact.

236
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:50,000
But you have to admit,
it's a lot more fun

237
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:51,958
doing it this way, isn't it?

238
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:55,250
You're still as awful
as you've ever been.

239
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:02,708
Sohara! Where
are you?! Sohara!

240
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:04,916
Don't you dare come near me!

241
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:08,166
Why are you running away?!

242
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:10,416
My underwear
exploded thanks to you!

243
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,416
I've gone freakin'
commando and it's your fault!

244
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:20,083
What was that?! Speak up!

245
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:22,541
I just want this to end!

246
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,166
Wait, Sohara!
Stay where you are!

247
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:31,125
Oh crap! Not my room!

248
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:35,541
Sohara! Whatever you do,
don't open the closet!

249
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:38,958
All my, uh, research
material is... oh.

250
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:43,375
Wow, there's... So much.

251
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:46,250
Quick! Take cover! I set
up a booby-trap in here to

252
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:48,458
protect my treasure
from outsiders!

253
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:51,666
The light!

254
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:55,458
What is that?

255
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:58,416
Duh, it's the booby trap I
was trying to warn you about!

256
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,833
I was up all last
night building it!

257
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:04,250
The Hyper-Fusion Panty Robot!

258
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:10,375
Sohara!

259
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:12,083
Let me go!

260
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:14,291
I have no choice. The
only way to save Sohara

261
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:17,166
is to fight the panty
robot! But if anymore panties

262
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:20,416
explode right now, Sohara
will be in deep trouble!

263
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,791
What should I do?!

264
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:24,625
Sonny! Sonny boy!

265
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:28,083
That voice... Grampa!

266
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:34,083
What's the matter,
Grampa? You look hurt.

267
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,625
Ran into some trouble
with the old lady,

268
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:40,125
if you know what I mean...

269
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,500
Grampa!

270
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:47,708
Listen up, now boy, and never
forget what your grandpa's

271
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:50,958
about to tell ya.
As a man, like me...

272
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:55,041
Someday down the road you'll
find something you like so much

273
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:56,791
you won't be
able to give it up.

274
00:18:56,875 --> 00:19:00,166
Odds are it'll come back
to haunt you in the end.

275
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:03,250
What will you do
when that happens?

276
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:09,833
Will you turn tail and
run? Of course you won't.

277
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:17,250
Thank you, Grandpa. As always,
you've helped show me the light.

278
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:21,458
Tomoki! Save me!

279
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:34,833
Tomoki!

280
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:38,125
That's it, sonny boy! Grab
whatcha love and hold onto it!

281
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,166
I believe in you!

282
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:46,291
Ha-ha!

283
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:52,250
Show 'em, boy! Show
'em what you're made of!

284
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:55,958
Panties! Come to me!

285
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,125
Yesss...

286
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:14,375
Are they dead?

287
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:16,916
I'd say it's a
definite possibility.

288
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:20,333
It is Master.

289
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:37,583
The battle is won...
But not the war.

290
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,000
You're awake.

291
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:48,916
Oh, hey there.
Thank you, Tomo.

292
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,916
You saved my life, didn't you?

293
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,208
Listen... Today was all
my fault... I'm sorry...

294
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:09,416
Tomo, you sick bastard!

295
00:22:40,666 --> 00:22:45,750
Pantzer Break! Okay, now
listen up! Your job is to

296
00:22:45,833 --> 00:22:48,833
protect my collection
of booby-mags at all cost!

297
00:22:48,916 --> 00:22:52,041
You are not to let anyone
find 'em, you got me?

298
00:23:03,708 --> 00:23:05,666
Well, time to hit the sack.

299
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:14,916
Had I known
this would happen,

300
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,583
I never would have
sent an angel to you.

301
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,500
I'm sorry. It looks like
even you will get up caught

302
00:23:21,583 --> 00:23:25,666
in this mess.
She's been spotted.

303
00:24:04,083 --> 00:24:07,500
Next time... "Hot
Night with the Big Fish."
