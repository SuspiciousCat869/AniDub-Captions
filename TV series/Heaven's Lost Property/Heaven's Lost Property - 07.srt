1
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,458
Morning, Tomoki!

2
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,166
Morning to you, Sohara.

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,958
I'll be back later. Take care
of the house for me, will ya?

4
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:40,041
Yes, Master, of course I will.

5
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:41,541
Where are you going?

6
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:44,500
To school. Summer
vacation's over so

7
00:00:44,583 --> 00:00:46,083
we have to go back to class.

8
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:47,125
Oh, yeah?

9
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:52,833
Listen! I'm only gonna tell
you this once. Do not follow me!

10
00:00:52,916 --> 00:00:54,000
I won't.

11
00:00:54,958 --> 00:00:57,250
Come on, will ya?!
We don't wanna be late!

12
00:00:57,333 --> 00:00:59,375
Coming! See you later.

13
00:00:59,458 --> 00:01:00,958
So long, Master.

14
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:03,541
So did you do yesterday's
modern language homework?

15
00:01:03,625 --> 00:01:04,791
It was really hard.

16
00:01:04,875 --> 00:01:06,250
No, can I copy yours?

17
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:08,083
Maybe, what're
you gonna do for me?

18
00:01:08,166 --> 00:01:09,958
Well that depends.
Whaddaya want?

19
00:01:10,541 --> 00:01:13,083
So you wanna go check
out this "school" business?

20
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:17,250
But I promised Master I
would take care of the house.

21
00:01:19,708 --> 00:01:21,583
For cryin' out loud,
just gimme that!

22
00:02:57,458 --> 00:03:00,875
Why has humanity always
been so entranced by the sky?

23
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:02,750
In Greek mythology,
there is a short tale

24
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:04,583
that demonstrates this.

25
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:07,333
To escape their island prison,
a man fashioned wings of

26
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:09,916
wax and feathers
for himself and his son.

27
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,458
The man warned his son
to follow close behind,

28
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:15,000
but lost in the euphoria
of flight, the boy soared

29
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:16,583
too close to the Sun.

30
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:19,916
His wings melted and he
fell to his death in the sea.

31
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,333
This body of
water was eventually

32
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:24,875
named after the boy. Icarus.

33
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:26,458
Yes?

34
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:29,250
There's no need to respond.

35
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:30,500
I'm sorry.

36
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,000
All humans should be able
to fly like an avian on wings

37
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:42,750
that no one can see.
It's a travesty we can't.

38
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:47,208
What is Ikaros
doing here at school?

39
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:56,166
Eh, we have a couple
new transfer students

40
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,541
joining us today.

41
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:00,500
This is Ikaros and Nymph.

42
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:02,791
Please, welcome
them to our class.

43
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:09,416
I don't believe this!
What're they doing here?

44
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:18,416
It's so hot.

45
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:27,000
Are you all right, Master?

46
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:29,250
Wait, she knows Tomoki?

47
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:31,166
Oh man, they're
both totally cute!

48
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,750
It looks like they're
both wearing wings.

49
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:35,125
I didn't know Tomoki was...
into that sort of thing.

50
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:36,625
Tomo. What should we do?

51
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:39,208
If I put up a stink
now, everyone'll find out

52
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:41,208
I know these freaky aliens.

53
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:43,416
Come on, Tomoki.
Calm your nerves!

54
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,416
Peace and quiet is the best.
Peace and quiet is the best!

55
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:56,166
What the Hell are
you two doing here?

56
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,166
Sorry, Master.
Nymph made me.

57
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,375
I see no problem
with us going to school.

58
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:02,208
Sure, now it's
just going to school.

59
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:04,125
What's the next
headache you'll cause?

60
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:05,833
Don't get your
panties in a wad.

61
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:08,541
I mean really, how
is this a bad thing?

62
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:10,791
Maybe try going with it.
It'll certainly make

63
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,500
your life more interesting.

64
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:15,333
I'm pretty freaking sure
my life is interesting enough!

65
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:16,708
Perhaps it is.

66
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:19,583
What's that mean?!

67
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:22,416
Oh! That's so adorable!
You have little sleeves for

68
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,333
your wings sewn
into your uniforms!

69
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:27,291
Dammit, listen to what
I'm saying, you jerk-offs!

70
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:29,125
How are you a
transfer student when

71
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:30,875
you've never
set foot in a school?

72
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:32,583
I helped myself to
one of Alpha's cards

73
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:35,083
and made some adjustments
to your teacher's memory.

74
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:37,041
Who the Hell does that?!

75
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:39,666
Take a few deep
breaths, Tomoki. Chill.

76
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:44,083
Now listen because this
is important. Don't you think

77
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:46,625
you should let them adjust
to a normal way of life?

78
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:48,208
Huh?

79
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:50,208
You are always telling Ikaros
to act more like a human being,

80
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:52,208
so where's the
harm in her trying?

81
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:55,041
He has a point. And let's
not forget about Nymph here.

82
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:57,625
She needs to learn about
the world too, you know.

83
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:03,041
Just look at Ikaros. She's
like a doll with a face molded

84
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:06,208
into a frown. Don't you
want to step up and help her?

85
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:15,125
Yeah, all right, I get it.
Promise... you'll act normal

86
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,208
and not do anything crazy!

87
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,625
Don't have to
tell me, dumb bug.

88
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:24,291
Nymph. Ikaros. This is great
news, you'll have so much fun!

89
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:26,375
Get ready for the
time of your lives!

90
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:29,000
I'm gonna show you what being
in school's really about!

91
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,916
Okay. This is the
continent of Australia.

92
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,625
It's very big, so
it has a number of...

93
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:37,416
Let's see... Yes!

94
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:43,333
Hey, Ikaros, how's it
going? Are you having any

95
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:45,083
issues taking notes?

96
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:47,833
I'm pretty good at it, so I can
make copies for you if you...

97
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:54,958
Oh well, I guess Ikaros can
copy off the board just fine

98
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:58,500
by herself. That's good.
I'm proud of her.

99
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:04,375
Wait! Nymph hasn't been here
nearly as long as Ikaros has!

100
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:07,000
I bet I can teach
her all sorts of stuff!

101
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:10,875
Hey, Nymph. Aren't
you taking notes?

102
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:13,125
If you want, you can
totally copy off of mine!

103
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:14,375
Doesn't matter.

104
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:18,833
'Kay. Just thought I'd offer.
So what are you looking at

105
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:20,166
out the window?

106
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:21,583
The birds.

107
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,958
You like birds, huh? Me too.
I can even tell you what

108
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:28,416
each of 'em is called.
That one right there

109
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,833
is called a Tree Sparrow.
And that one... is a...

110
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:34,500
It's a Pied Wagtail, right?

111
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:37,458
Over there's a White Eye.
Another Wagtail.

112
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:39,166
And the chubby
one's a Great Tit.

113
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:42,208
There's an Oriental Turtle-Dove,
a White-Cheeked Starling,

114
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:43,333
and a Bulbul.

115
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:47,833
Today we'll be
focusing on cooking.

116
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:50,500
Everyone split into groups
and cook whatever you like,

117
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:51,916
just make sure you have fun.

118
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,250
Okay!

119
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:56,083
All right. I'm pretty
awesome at Home Ec.

120
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:59,458
This time I'll be able to give
Ikaros and Nymph tons of advice!

121
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,166
Here, let me help you,
Ikaros. You gotta make sure

122
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,333
and hold the knife
right. Like this...

123
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:09,208
Check this out, Nymph.
To bring out the flavor and

124
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:12,416
add some pizzazz to your dish,
use soy sauce. It's yummy!

125
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:16,041
Amazing. Thank you
so much, Sohara.

126
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:19,333
Oh, yeah. I'm all over this!

127
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:23,000
Miss Tadai! I noticed Ikaros
and Nymph aren't here yet.

128
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:24,291
Shouldn't we wait for them?

129
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:36,000
Sorry we're late.

130
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:40,250
Why am I holding
this stupid fish?

131
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:44,291
I'm sorry, Nymph. I needed help.
I couldn't carry both of them.

132
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:46,750
Well I guess, we
better start cooking, huh?

133
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,875
Wow, Ikaros,
that's so awesome!

134
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:54,416
Just like a real
chef! That's amazing!

135
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:04,125
That's good! I think
I have a sweet tooth!

136
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:06,916
Quit it. We're not
supposed to eat them yet.

137
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,708
Shut up, whiner-bug.

138
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:11,958
Are you cookin' or just
tasting everyone else's?

139
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:13,125
That's mine.

140
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:19,583
You can't have
that much smoke inside!

141
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:25,375
Aw, man. What a mess.

142
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:28,916
So, Nymph, you just transferred
here? Was your last school

143
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,875
so far ahead of us
academically that you feel

144
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:33,333
it's all right to ignore
every word I'm saying?

145
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,541
That's it! If you
want to daydream then

146
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:38,333
solve this problem first!

147
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:40,375
No problem. A twelve-sided
polygon is drawn

148
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:42,916
inside a circle,
which has a radius of one.

149
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,750
The length of a single
side of said polygon...

150
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:46,541
What in the world
is Nymph talking about?

151
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:49,208
I don't even understand the
problem, let alone the answer.

152
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:51,375
Ikaros, do you
understand this?

153
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:54,666
Me neither! I am so lost!

154
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,416
Since you're so quick
to interrupt the class

155
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,500
like that then...
Answer this next question!

156
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,791
Who, me? I don't know if I...

157
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:07,666
Ikaros! Take it easy there!

158
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:11,250
F of x equals x-squared
minus nx plus m. Therefore

159
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:15,583
the equation for the axis would
be x equals Positive n over 2.

160
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:18,333
Because n is less
than or equal to 2m,

161
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:20,041
then x must be...

162
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:21,083
Manzana.

163
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:22,750
Man-zanna.

164
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:24,458
Manzana.

165
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:25,875
Mahn-zah-na.

166
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:27,500
Manzana.

167
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:28,875
Man-sanna.

168
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:35,583
Manzana-Manzana-Manzana-
Manzana-Manzana-Manzana!

169
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:40,750
Hey, Alpha. What're you
thinking about right now?

170
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:49,958
Oh, I just got
some juicy information.

171
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:53,625
It looks like bringing
you to school was

172
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:55,708
worth the trouble after all.

173
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:03,875
Don't you act
innocent in all this.

174
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:05,708
So, how did your
morning classes go?

175
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:09,083
Freaking awful. But Nymph
and Ikaros are good students,

176
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:11,833
which surprised me since
they're Angeloids and all.

177
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:15,000
How are they doing socially,
any trouble fitting in?

178
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:17,041
Judging by the way the
boys are fawning over them,

179
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:20,250
I'd say they're adjusting
pretty well. Y'see?

180
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:21,791
Back off!

181
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:22,500
Hey, you're
pushing yourself...

182
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:23,791
When did this happen?

183
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:25,416
The entire
school's talking about

184
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,041
the two cute transfer girls.

185
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:29,500
Sure didn't take very long
for the news to spread.

186
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:30,916
This is insane!

187
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:37,125
Listen up you disgusting bugs!
Keep the chatter down!

188
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:39,291
I'm trying to watch my soaps!

189
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:41,750
And now just like bugs,
watch 'em scatter.

190
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:45,583
Oh! Spank us baby,
we're bad boys!

191
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:46,916
Hey, what happened to Sohara?

192
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,666
Take a look for yourself.

193
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,250
You okay?

194
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:53,083
Leave me alone.

195
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:54,958
Let me guess, you've been
comparing yourself to them

196
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:58,291
all day and now you feel
like a big, fat, ugly loser?

197
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:00,833
Oops, did I hit a nerve?

198
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:03,416
Enough Mikako,
you're being rude.

199
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,000
Uh oh. Time
for our next class.

200
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:08,791
What? We have to
go to more classes?

201
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:10,541
But they're all so boring!

202
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:13,208
Hey, Alpha.

203
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:16,375
Stop it! Take your
filthy hands off of me!

204
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:18,208
You should be
ashamed of yourself!

205
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:20,625
Today, class, we
will be learning about

206
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:23,041
chemical symbols
and formulae...

207
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,041
A-homina! Homina homina!
Life is so wonderful!

208
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:32,041
Oh, yeah baby. I'm a vegan
for life, that's for sure!

209
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,791
I would like to do things
a little differently.

210
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:40,625
A guest lecturer will
be taking over the class.

211
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,750
I'd like you to
meet Miss Ikaros.

212
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:48,958
Hello, class.

213
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:50,750
What the hell?
She's teaching us now?!

214
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:53,583
Oh wow. She looks
great in a lab coat.

215
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:55,125
You put her up
to this, didn't you?

216
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:56,791
Oh, she'll be a great
teacher! I could listen to

217
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:58,583
Ikaros drone on for hours!

218
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:00,208
She's like the smartest
person I've ever known.

219
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:01,291
I'll start as soon
as everyone's ready.

220
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:02,833
That's not the problem!

221
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:05,791
Ms. Ikaros, can you tell us
what we will be studying today?

222
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:07,416
Wait a minute! What
are you doing here?!

223
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,750
Teacher! I propose we
use Tomoki as a test subject

224
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:11,541
for some fun experiments.

225
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,041
Don't treat me
like your play thing!

226
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,041
You don't own me!
Nobody owns me!

227
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:20,166
This is our subject for today.

228
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:27,041
Let's begin with a
demonstration. Any volunteers?

229
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:30,708
Whadda ya mean volunteers?
Don't look at me!

230
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:38,083
Let go of me! You're abusing
my rights or something!

231
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:39,958
Don't worry, you'll be fine.

232
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:42,416
Many people have
wings on their backs.

233
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,333
Although they are invisible
to the naked human eye.

234
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:52,000
They are there. And Master, your
wings are much larger than most.

235
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:59,375
I'm sure of it. I don't
know why exactly. But I am.

236
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:10,583
Go on, Master. The sky...
is calling to you.

237
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:31,416
Tomoki! Tomoki! Tomoki!

238
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:41,416
Tomoki! Tomoki! Tomoki!

239
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:46,500
Tomoki! Tomoki! Tomoki!

240
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:48,583
I was prepared
for this eventuality.

241
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:50,375
These are for you, Tomoki.

242
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:52,125
Thanks for looking out, bro.

243
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:57,041
That is so awesome!

244
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:58,916
Fly, Tomoki! Fly!

245
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,750
You can do it!
We believe in you!

246
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:01,916
Do it for us!

247
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:14,166
Tomoki...
Tomoki... Tomoki...

248
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:17,958
I want each of you...
to remember...

249
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,750
If you truly believe
it's possible...

250
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:26,875
anyone can fly...

251
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:32,416
Into the endless blue.

252
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,833
I am sorry you were
injured. It's my fault.

253
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:53,541
You just got lucky. That fall
could've been a lot worse.

254
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:56,166
I'd be mad, but
that'd just hurt more.

255
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:59,041
I promise I won't go
to school ever again.

256
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,291
Yeah, about that school stuff.

257
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:09,083
You just want to attend, right?

258
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:14,875
Fine then, I'll cave. You can
both go back to school tomorrow.

259
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:17,583
I hope you're happy.
Now leave me alone!

260
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:22,416
Yes, Master.
Have a good night.

261
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:33,875
Good morning! How
are you?! Hey, Ikaros!

262
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,083
Ikaros, did you
do the math homework?

263
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:37,416
I did it this morning.

264
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,208
Oh, hey, Nymph, you like
to watch soaps, don't you?

265
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,708
Isn't that nice, Tomo? Doesn't
look like the girls will have

266
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:44,791
any trouble
making new friends.

267
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:46,625
Oh, good.

268
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:07,958
Haven't you ever
seen a birdcage before?

269
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:11,000
Nymph really likes birds.
She knows all of their names.

270
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:26,250
What the Hell'd
you do that for?!

271
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:30,666
It doesn't really matter.

272
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:38,958
Whoa, seriously?

273
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:42,333
That's... a lot.

274
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:45,333
What are these things,
Master? They're not mine.

275
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:48,583
They're love letters...
Like from boys.

276
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:50,458
Love letters from boys?

277
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:52,166
This is just stupid.

278
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:57,500
Stop it! Think about the people
who poured their hearts out

279
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:59,833
in those letters. You
can't just throw them away!

280
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:01,833
But that doesn't interest
me in the slightest.

281
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:03,916
Just read 'em, or
at least take 'em home.

282
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,750
Would it kill you to do that?

283
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:08,500
Jeez, bug. You're
so annoying sometimes.

284
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:10,083
Love letters?

285
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:11,708
Yeah, you
should've seen the pile.

286
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,291
There was a
freakin' ton of 'em!

287
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,583
But do you really think Ikaros
can understand the concept of

288
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:18,041
love when it's simply
written on a piece of paper?

289
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:20,541
She said she wants to try
to figure it out, which is why

290
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:23,416
she's in the library
right now reading each one.

291
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,250
She's keeping them to
herself. How sweet of her.

292
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:27,583
If it were me,
I'd read them aloud to

293
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:29,250
the entire student body.

294
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:32,958
Gee... I never knew the
guys in our school had such

295
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:36,666
weird fetishes. She has
wings, ya know. Real wings.

296
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,375
But Ikaros has a
lot goin' for her.

297
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:40,083
She's cute and she can cook.

298
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:42,750
And Nymph's cute too, as
well as being a cool person.

299
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:44,625
Yeah, I guess you
got a point there.

300
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:46,291
So what do you think, Tomo?

301
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,750
Huh?

302
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:51,416
Don't act like I'm an idiot.
You've been living with Ikaros

303
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,083
this entire time.
Are you saying you haven't

304
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:56,000
once thought she's cute?

305
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:02,541
Say what? You're outta your
damn mind. What an idiot.

306
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:06,166
Deny all you want,
just don't be a dick.

307
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,083
Sorry about that.

308
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:10,458
But I hear what you're
saying. You don't really

309
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:13,666
like her like her, but you
more like her like a friend.

310
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:17,083
Well yeah! Like a friend!
I'd never "like her" like her!

311
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:18,416
Oh! Good!

312
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:20,666
Way to cover, Tomoki.

313
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,583
Tomoki, you are so evil.

314
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:28,000
Shut up, I am not! I'm just...
I'm just happy for both of 'em.

315
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,416
For trying to
lead normal lives.

316
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:34,333
If you think about it, they're
not that much different from us.

317
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:37,291
So why shouldn't they have
the same chances, ya know?

318
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:42,708
I just hope Ikaros can
learn how to act more human.

319
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:47,041
So that maybe, one day...
She can learn how to smile.

320
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,416
This is stupid,
they're all the same.

321
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,333
They keep saying how much
they're in love with you.

322
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:57,875
If your eyes stay
green like that forever,

323
00:19:57,958 --> 00:19:59,416
you'll never be
able to understand

324
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,833
what this love thing
they're talking about is.

325
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:02,666
Huh?

326
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:08,291
It'll be easier if I just show
you. Eh, good time for it.

327
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:11,666
Since there's no one
else around to interrupt us.

328
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:17,416
I've been watching you
like a hawk the whole time

329
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:20,000
I've been with
you. Here we go.

330
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:23,250
Initiating scan.

331
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:27,875
Functionality protection,
ninety-nine percent normal...

332
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:31,041
Variable wing protection,
seventy-two percent normal...

333
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:33,375
Memory protection,
one hundred percent...

334
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:36,166
Emotional protection,
one hundred percent.

335
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:39,833
I knew something was up! You've
got protections all over you.

336
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:42,541
Your abilities, your memories,
even your emotions!

337
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:44,250
What a freakin' joke!

338
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:45,583
What?

339
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:48,291
You're barely more than
a doll. You used to be the

340
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:51,916
infamous Uranus Queen who
terrorized the entire Synapse!

341
00:20:56,916 --> 00:20:58,333
Am I interrupting?

342
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:00,291
Not anymore, you're not.

343
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:14,541
So I don't get it. If Alpha
doesn't know what love is,

344
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:16,750
why's she reading all
those idiotic letters?

345
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:18,500
Kinda silly, don't you think?

346
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:21,583
I do... Although it seems as
if she's had some restrictions

347
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:24,708
placed on her emotions...
But you're an Angeloid yourself

348
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:26,666
and you seem
pretty well-balanced.

349
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:29,625
Based on what I've witnessed,
I would guess you were both

350
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:32,958
sent here for entirely
different purposes.

351
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,875
What are you
getting at, nerd-bug?

352
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:44,583
I wonder what these letters
mean. I can read all the words

353
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:49,416
but they hold no meaning,
and that bothers me. Why?

354
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:54,541
I love you.

355
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:03,583
What does it mean? Master?

356
00:23:47,458 --> 00:23:51,875
Yes... Per your request, I
will retrieve the Uranus Queen.

357
00:23:56,916 --> 00:24:02,083
I will do whatever you command.
All I ask is patience, Master.

358
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:07,541
Next time... "For Whom the
Shooting Festival is Held."
