1
00:00:30,083 --> 00:00:34,000
Things are crazy right now,
I'm kind of overwhelmed.

2
00:00:34,916 --> 00:00:38,041
The chain on my collar's been
cut. Which eliminates any danger

3
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:41,750
of the bomb inside of it from
detonating, so that's good.

4
00:00:42,458 --> 00:00:45,541
But the moment that chain was
severed, so was the only thing

5
00:00:45,625 --> 00:00:49,458
I ever truly had.
The connection to my master.

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,250
The only way an Angeloid finds
meaning in her existence is by

7
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:56,083
following her master's
orders to the letter.

8
00:00:56,166 --> 00:00:59,208
But now, who do I obey?

9
00:00:59,291 --> 00:01:02,166
What am I supposed to
do with this new life?

10
00:01:04,375 --> 00:01:06,833
Maybe I should seek
out a new master.

11
00:01:06,916 --> 00:01:09,458
I wonder what Tomoki
would think about that.

12
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:16,166
I will return to the Promised
Land! The girl's locker room!

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,833
What goes through
that head of his?

14
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:54,125
What are you up to?

15
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:56,666
Just building a new glider.

16
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,541
What's wrong?

17
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:03,500
I don't know what I'm supposed
to do with myself anymore.

18
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:06,625
I'm all alone.
I don't have a master.

19
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:10,541
And now you're a bird that
can fly freely through the air.

20
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:13,333
I'd call that a welcome
change from the norm.

21
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:14,916
Maybe.

22
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,875
You'll be fine. Give it a little
while, and I'm sure the answer

23
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:19,250
you need will come
to you in due time.

24
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:29,375
That means a lot. Hearing
it like that makes sense.

25
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:31,458
I think you may be right.

26
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:36,750
I hope you get to
fly soon, too, Sugata.

27
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:44,125
I told him we'd never go out.

28
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:50,416
Quantum conversion operating
at one hundred percent.

29
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,000
Metamorphosis stability:
all green.

30
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:55,916
At the present time,
everything is looking favorable.

31
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,250
How are you holding
up so far, Master?

32
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:00,333
"Favorable," yeah!

33
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:05,875
I might just start appreciating
the joys of being stepped on.

34
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:08,041
You sound just fine.

35
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:09,958
Perfect. This is exactly
what you should use the

36
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:13,500
greatest combat weapon ever
for. Doesn't what you're doing

37
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:16,625
seem the slightest
bit ridiculous, Alpha?

38
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:18,875
Master ordered me to do this.

39
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:23,208
And you seem to be enjoying it!
Which I guess isn't a problem.

40
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:27,083
I just wish I had some orders
from my master to carry out.

41
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,416
Tomoki.

42
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,625
Oh, hey. Is that you, Nymph?

43
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:34,166
I was just wondering if there's
anything I can do to help.

44
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,666
I got some free time.

45
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,708
Yeah, no. I'm good.

46
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:39,916
O-kay.

47
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,583
All right, Ikaros.
Time to transform me into

48
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:44,333
something else and move on!

49
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:51,166
So naughty!

50
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,833
Sorry to blow your
minds girls! Tomoko's back!

51
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:57,458
And now, it's
time to charge into

52
00:04:57,541 --> 00:04:59,416
the Tennis Club's
locker room!

53
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:09,500
Crap! Why the
Hell's Sohara here?

54
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:13,291
Master. The Tennis Club
is still meeting in there

55
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:14,291
and she's a member.

56
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:15,791
Yeah, but that sucks!

57
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,916
As long as she's in there,
my peeping day is ruined!

58
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,958
She knows who I am.
I'm totally screwed!

59
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:24,958
Time for me to pitch in. I knew
if I stuck around long enough,

60
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:26,291
I'd be needed for-- 

61
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:27,791
No way. Everything up
to now has been a warm up.

62
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:30,250
That's all. The main
event is on its way.

63
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:33,125
You're not going
to give me an order?

64
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,583
I'm sick of gawking at bras
and panties all the time.

65
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:38,208
That's why my next target
is going to be a location like

66
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:41,125
you've never seen. A
paradise where even more girls

67
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:43,750
will be running
around half-naked!

68
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:49,833
Welcome to the
Satsukitane Swim Resort!

69
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:51,750
Please, make
yourselves at home.

70
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:53,958
What's mine is yours,
as you well know.

71
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:57,125
I had no idea your family
owned an indoor water park.

72
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:59,291
Seriously, that's
beyond awesome.

73
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:01,125
There are quite
a few people here.

74
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:03,583
Do you plan on changing
into a swim suit, Sugata?

75
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:05,708
Sorry. These are
the only clothes I own.

76
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:07,666
I have to say Sohara that's...

77
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,541
a big tube you have
wrapped around you.

78
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:12,375
Yeah, that's
because I can't swim.

79
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:14,750
If you'll recall,
neither can Ikaros.

80
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:23,416
An Angeloid's wings soak
up water, which become quite

81
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,000
heavy and weigh us down.

82
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:28,625
If that's the case, Nymph should
be able to swim just fine.

83
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:30,500
You don't have any
wings to get water-logged

84
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:32,500
so you won't
drop like a stone.

85
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:36,083
Don't make fun of me! I can
swim with or without wings.

86
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:37,125
So just shut up.

87
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:38,333
Let's see.

88
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:47,875
For your freakin'
information, Angeloids are not

89
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:49,791
designed to be able to swim!

90
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:52,041
Definitely not true.

91
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:56,583
Wow, is that true? Come to
think of it, where is Tomoki?

92
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,500
He was here
just a moment ago.

93
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:00,500
Where did he run off to now?

94
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:03,416
I mean, he was the one who
said we should all to go to

95
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,333
the pool together
in the first place.

96
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:12,000
I can't stand this any more!
All the smokin' hot bodies!

97
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:15,625
The slick-wet clingy swimsuits.
There's a richness you just

98
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:17,750
can't get from
bras and panties!

99
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:18,958
Tomoki!

100
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:20,916
Adios!

101
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:24,125
Where'd he go?

102
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,291
Prez! Look out behind you!

103
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:46,791
I've never been on
one of these before.

104
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:48,708
Guess I just jump in here.

105
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,875
Well, this isn't fun at all.

106
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:56,666
Anchors away.

107
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:16,083
I was right! This place
is paradise on earth!

108
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,833
Tomoki! What has
gotten into you?!

109
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,875
You're acting like a lunatic.

110
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:25,958
Uhhh. I'm-a so sorry, I
don'-a speak-a you language.

111
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:28,875
You don't speak the language?!
Whatever, my money says

112
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:31,250
you've been planning this
since before we even got here!

113
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:33,666
Hold up. Just
hear me out, would ya?

114
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:36,250
Look around you,
Sohara. Just look.

115
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,541
See all those faces?
They're happy!

116
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:41,708
Makes this argument seem
kind of silly, doesn't it?

117
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:43,625
I dunno. I guess, maybe?

118
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:47,958
Nothing but smiling faces...
at peace... And of course...

119
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:51,000
A veritable cornucopia of
butts and boobies bursting from

120
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:52,791
the confines of their suits!

121
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:54,958
Beautiful young women,
prancing about in public,

122
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:57,875
in broad daylight! Half-naked
of their own volition!

123
00:08:57,958 --> 00:08:59,375
That's what the pool is!

124
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:01,875
If I can't come here to get
my fill of the female form,

125
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,750
then where would you
have me go?! Huh?! Where?!

126
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:06,750
What a bunch of
self-serving hokum.

127
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:08,833
I'd say it's almost
refreshing to see this

128
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:10,916
bold approach toward ogling.

129
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
If you'll excuse me.

130
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:18,500
Oh yeah, Sohara. If you still
wanna hit me, that's cool.

131
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:21,333
You just have to
come out here to do it.

132
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:23,791
Sohara, let me
handle this one.

133
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:25,250
What are you gonna do?

134
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:28,916
I don't care who you are,
you're taking this too far.

135
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,291
Commence Tomoki hacking!

136
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:38,208
What's this? I can't swim!
What's happening?! Help!

137
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,458
What did you do to me?!

138
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:47,125
Nothing special. I just
hacked your tiny brain

139
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:49,291
and put a block on all your
memories involving swimming

140
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:50,708
so you couldn't do it anymore.

141
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:53,250
Fascinating. So now
Tomoki will sink like a stone

142
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:54,833
anytime he gets in the water.

143
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:58,458
Now if you try any more of your
perverted crap, you could drown.

144
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:00,041
That's kinda funny.

145
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:02,458
Yeah. I think it's time for the
rest of us to enjoy ourselves.

146
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:04,375
What? Wait. Guys!

147
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:07,291
No, please! You can't
do this! This is cruel

148
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:11,250
and unusual punishment! Oh god.
Does this mean my days of

149
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:13,958
checking out half-naked
hotties are over?!

150
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:17,666
What's the point of even coming
to the water park anymore?!

151
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:22,541
"Dear Grandpa.
Here I am at the pool,

152
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,750
and I can't
even enjoy the ladies.

153
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,250
My life has lost any
semblance of meaning.

154
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:28,958
What do I do now?"

155
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:30,250
Master.

156
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:31,875
Hey, Ikaros.

157
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:34,333
Are you doing all right?

158
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:36,791
Doesn't matter. I'm
just gonna drift like this

159
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:38,416
for the rest of my life.

160
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,416
Wherever the current takes
me, that's where I'll go.

161
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:46,666
That slide is like a force
of nature it's so strong.

162
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:49,208
Duh! What's my
freakin' problem?!

163
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:51,583
Why am I so hung
up on swimsuits?!

164
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:54,541
Half-naked chicks
are all right, but...

165
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:55,416
Ikaros!

166
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,250
What is it Master?

167
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:59,416
I have an important
order for you.

168
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:03,083
You're lucky, Alpha, getting
to have Tomoki give you orders.

169
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:17,041
Isn't the current
moving kinda fast?

170
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:27,166
All is going according
to plan, Master.

171
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:30,541
Sugata, help!

172
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:32,125
Heads up! I'm tossing a line!

173
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:46,166
My swimsuit is coming loose!

174
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,916
Alpha's gotta be behind this!
Tomoki probably ordered her

175
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,333
to mess with the wave!

176
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:57,958
That's impossible!

177
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,625
My block in his brain
should still be in place.

178
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:03,083
How is he doing this?

179
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:05,625
Suits coming off, female
bodies thrashing about?

180
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:08,125
Your magic hoo-doo's nothing!
I just gotta copy what

181
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:09,583
I see them doing!

182
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:13,625
Oh, no! I'm not gonna make it!

183
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:35,833
I'm sinking! I'm gonna drown!
I don't wanna go out like this!

184
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:40,083
That's right, I forgot.
The lazy river is a circle!

185
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:42,208
I can just cruise
around all I like.

186
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:44,125
I don't have to swim at all.

187
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:49,041
I'm gonna drown!
I'm gonna drown!

188
00:12:57,541 --> 00:12:59,291
Oh, yeah! Definitely drowning!

189
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:15,125
All right, Tomoki. Let's
think about this rationally.

190
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:19,208
It's a simple matter,
really. Whether I drown or

191
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:23,625
whether I don't. Whether
I live. Or whether I...

192
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:31,500
Tomo! Tomoki!

193
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:41,041
Whoa! Grandpa!

194
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:44,000
Tomoki. Go back.
It's not your time.

195
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:45,750
There's still
something you have to do!

196
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:47,791
Something I have to do?

197
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:52,833
Grandpa? Grandpa!

198
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:56,375
Master... Master!

199
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:02,125
I thought I was a goner!

200
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:05,208
Where did everyone go?

201
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:07,208
The pool was closed
after the incident,

202
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:09,208
so they went to go
change out of their suits.

203
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:11,208
No! They're changing?!

204
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:14,500
So that's it.
The pool day is over.

205
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:17,041
Thank you for the
second chance, Grandpa.

206
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:20,458
I swear, I will not let
this life be for nothing!

207
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,875
Thanks for waiting,
everyone. Here we go.

208
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:27,583
The ladies changing room at
the pool. The final sanctuary!

209
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:30,541
Inside waits a world
where bras, panties,

210
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:33,000
and swimsuits
are unnecessary.

211
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:45,291
Yes. Yes. Yeeessss!
Eeeee-yeeeessss!

212
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:49,875
This is my new form!
This is what I am now!

213
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:54,750
Here we go! She's putting
me on! She's putting me on!

214
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:59,333
I am climbing that
stairway to adulthood!

215
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:03,333
So! Which of these fine betties
is slipping me up her thighs?!

216
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:11,583
Okay this is weird. Were my
panties always so freakin' ugly?

217
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:13,500
Don't move! Don't you dare!

218
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:15,916
Move even a single
inch and your dead meat!

219
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,833
Master, if you get too worked
up, you know what will happen!

220
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:26,750
You're kidding me.

221
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:34,291
The scene was one far too
gruesome to call a massacre.

222
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:39,458
All that can reasonably be said
is we lost something that day.

223
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:44,291
Something sacred. And what
would that be, you ask?

224
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:48,458
I thought it was as
obvious as the sun in the sky.

225
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:53,750
We lost our greatest
warrior. So we thank him.

226
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:56,250
Thank you, Tomoki,
for giving us a dream.

227
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:59,416
Thank you for giving us hope.

228
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:03,708
Truly my friend,
thank you. Thank you.

229
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:20,666
It's just a
piece of junk now.

230
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:23,125
Sohara broke my
quantum converter!

231
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:24,708
You mean you still
haven't gotten your fill of

232
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:26,208
panties and boobs and stuff?

233
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:28,333
Hell no! How am
I supposed to peep on

234
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:30,666
the changing
rooms now?! Huh?!

235
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:34,791
There's always
Cool Guy Jamming.

236
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:38,291
If I invoke it, you can peep,
do whatever, and the girls

237
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:41,166
won't notice you any more
than the paint on the walls.

238
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:44,083
Then what are you
waiting for?! Invoke it!

239
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:47,041
Do it, please!
I'm begging you!

240
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:50,541
Sorry, not unless
you order me to do it.

241
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:52,583
Uh... Yeah. I dunno.

242
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:53,458
Come on!

243
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:54,416
Why?

244
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:57,458
It's just... with my master
gone, there's no one to

245
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:59,458
give me orders, so I'm
kind of wandering around

246
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:03,791
with no purpose. Please,
Tomoki, gimme an order!

247
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:08,583
I can't do that, Nymph.

248
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:11,666
How come? Don't you
have any orders for me?

249
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:14,000
I'll do anything
you need. Just tell me.

250
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:15,750
What do you want me to do?

251
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:19,708
You need to decide
that for yourself.

252
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:24,541
You can go wherever you want
now. Do whatever you want.

253
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:27,333
That's free will.
Welcome to it.

254
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:32,208
I just do, whatever
I want? Tomoki...

255
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:38,625
Okay, let's go over
the answers to the quiz.

256
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:41,875
Number one is
"the Pacific Rim."

257
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:46,750
She's being held...
by the sky.

258
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:51,208
She sent you an angel because
she wanted you to help her.

259
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:55,666
But that doesn't really matter
anymore. It's so interesting.

260
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:58,791
She's never seen an angel
enjoy herself so much before.

261
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:00,833
Or at all for that matter.

262
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:05,166
I came to you because I
wanted your help as well.

263
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:09,583
But I think I'll just go
to sleep instead. Good-bye.

264
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:15,458
Although, I do have
a favor to ask of you,

265
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:17,291
if you're willing to assist.

266
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:22,500
Don't forget about me.
Whatever you do.

267
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:31,625
Tomoki! Tomoki, come on!
Wake up, would ya!

268
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:33,750
Class is over
and you're drooling!

269
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,166
Oh, man. That dream...

270
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,708
What, same one as usual?

271
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:42,416
Yeah, angel was
babblin' somethin' to me.

272
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,875
Can't remember what.

273
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:45,916
Think it had anything
to do with Ikaros and Nymph

274
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,083
and all the craziness
they keep stirring up?

275
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:49,500
I don't know.

276
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:52,583
You don't know. Well if
you don't, who the heck does?

277
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:56,458
I don't care.
Look, it's whatever.

278
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:58,708
Nothing beats
my peace and quiet.

279
00:18:58,791 --> 00:19:00,583
Long as you and me can
enjoy our time together,

280
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:03,041
it's enough for me.

281
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:05,666
Wow, I actually have
to agree with you for once.

282
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:09,125
Hey. What about you, what
kinda dreams do you have?

283
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:11,083
Like, did you
have one last night?

284
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,208
Last night?

285
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:22,500
Sohara...

286
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:24,916
Tomoki...

287
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:35,291
Oh, Tomo!
You rotten pervert!

288
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:38,833
No! It's way
too embarrassing!

289
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,291
Whoa, musta been
one heckuva dream!

290
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:44,500
Oh gosh, why would I even
have dreamt something like that?

291
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:48,833
Is it cause, someday, I might
actually want to marry Tomo?

292
00:19:48,916 --> 00:19:49,750
Sohara...

293
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:52,833
Sorry I spaced out
there. We gotta roll.

294
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:55,875
Sugata invited us over to his
place after school, remember?

295
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:57,291
I totally forgot!

296
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:05,041
Wow. I can't believe it's
already been a whole year.

297
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:12,708
Another trial flight? You're
never gonna learn, are you?

298
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:15,166
Whatever. Good luck!

299
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:18,500
We'll be waiting down the way
a bit for whenever you crash.

300
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:24,541
Sugata, I have a question.

301
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,291
Why do you keep trying so hard
at this? I mean, you've failed

302
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:30,625
over and over again, right?

303
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:34,000
Because I had a dream once.
A dream where I soared

304
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:37,375
through the sky.
I know this will work.

305
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,125
A dream. That's nice.

306
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:44,000
And just one more
thing Angeloids can't do.

307
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:47,583
Dreams you have while sleeping
aren't the only kind there are.

308
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:50,458
You've got something
you dream about don't you?

309
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:53,333
Something that you
hope will come true.

310
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:57,750
Yeah, I guess I do. I really
want Tomoki to be my master,

311
00:20:57,833 --> 00:20:59,458
but I try not
to think about it

312
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:01,625
because I know
it won't come true.

313
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:05,208
He told me I was free now,
and then he just walked away.

314
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:08,875
I dunno. Maybe
he doesn't like me.

315
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:12,875
It's the exact opposite.

316
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:16,291
That was Tomoki's
way of being nice to you.

317
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:18,500
That was... nice, huh?

318
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:23,541
So then that means he
doesn't hate me after all.

319
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:28,750
The wind's starting to pick up.

320
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:35,583
So are we go for launch?

321
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:38,250
We're "go." There's enough
wind for it, and while I'm not

322
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:40,458
perfectly happy with the
direction I'm about to go,

323
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:42,375
it shouldn't
affect my takeoff.

324
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:44,916
I wish you great
success in the sky.

325
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,583
I hope that somehow we all
get to see our dreams come true.

326
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:58,500
To a faraway new world!

327
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:08,958
He did it!

328
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:09,875
He's flying!

329
00:22:16,458 --> 00:22:21,083
So hey, Alpha. Do you mind
if I stay here from now on?

330
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:22,416
I would like that.

331
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,791
Even though I might
take Tomoki away from you.

332
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:26,333
You're sure?

333
00:22:26,416 --> 00:22:29,833
Of course. Whatever happens,
Master will still be my master.

334
00:22:30,375 --> 00:22:33,208
From now into
eternity. Forever.

335
00:22:33,291 --> 00:22:35,416
I had a
feeling you'd say that.

336
00:23:51,041 --> 00:23:53,791
Tomoki... Sakurai...

337
00:23:56,916 --> 00:23:59,000
What on earth was that?

338
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:06,666
"Heaven's Lost Property: Forte"
