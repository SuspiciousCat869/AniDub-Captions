1
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:36,708
Okay, smile!

2
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:41,750
If you're still having
trouble with it, just fake it.

3
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:43,208
Just fake it?

4
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:46,000
That's right. Just pretend
so you know what it's like.

5
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:51,708
All right,
Master. How is this?

6
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:57,666
That's not what I had in mind!

7
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:00,583
What's going on in here?

8
00:01:00,666 --> 00:01:03,083
I'm trying to teach
Ikaros how to smile.

9
00:01:03,875 --> 00:01:05,208
How to smile, huh?

10
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:07,625
Well, you know she's
always going on about how she

11
00:01:07,708 --> 00:01:09,833
wants to act more human...
I thought the first

12
00:01:09,916 --> 00:01:12,583
logical step is to
learn how to smile.

13
00:01:12,666 --> 00:01:14,375
Thing is you don't
have to really be happy to

14
00:01:14,458 --> 00:01:15,916
pull off a smile.

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,583
It's perfectly cool to fake
one if you're not feeling it.

16
00:01:18,666 --> 00:01:21,583
Watch me,
I'll show ya. See?!

17
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:23,625
Smiling.

18
00:01:24,625 --> 00:01:28,541
No! You can't just
say it! Now try it again!

19
00:01:28,916 --> 00:01:30,083
Grinning.

20
00:01:30,166 --> 00:01:31,958
Dammit Ikaros, you're
just saying the words,

21
00:01:32,041 --> 00:01:32,750
not making the face!

22
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:33,875
Smirking.

23
00:01:36,708 --> 00:01:41,291
I came here with one goal in
mind. To take Alpha back, but...

24
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:17,541
During the Age of Exploration,
the Europeans discovered

25
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:20,500
the New World and embarked
on a policy of colonialism,

26
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:23,458
which then turned into
all-out global expansion.

27
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:27,208
Believe it or not,
even Japan felt the effects.

28
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:31,250
As such, a number of Japanese
were treated like slaves

29
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:33,500
and sent to Europe
against their will.

30
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:37,333
Toyotomi Hideyoshi, the ruler
at the time, saw this trend

31
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:40,583
and exiled the Jesuits from
the country. This is considered

32
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:43,583
to be the beginning
of Japan's isolationist era.

33
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:46,250
The slave trade was hidden
beneath the flashy façade

34
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:48,125
that was pushed
by Western diplomats.

35
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:51,083
These marauding expansionists
were indifferent to the people,

36
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:52,833
leading them like
cattle to slaughter

37
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:55,166
in order to satisfy
their own petty desires.

38
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:58,166
It's likely that within the
New World hovering above us

39
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:01,833
there exists a new breed
of slavery. One which seeks to

40
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:05,375
fulfill their own
inhabitant's unearthly desires.

41
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,666
Huh? You don't
know how to smile?

42
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:15,083
Yeah right? Go figure, you'd
think it would be easy for her.

43
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:17,083
Got any ideas how
we could teach her?

44
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:18,958
That's a tough
one 'cause smiling is

45
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:20,750
something we do unconsciously.

46
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:25,083
Oh, I know! Ikaros. Try raising
your arms above your head.

47
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:27,041
Above my head. Like this?

48
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:28,291
Banzai!

49
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:32,083
This is one of your
tickle zones, it should put a

50
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:34,958
big smile on your face! Doesn't
it make you wanna giggle?

51
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:38,333
What the--?! What the
heck is wrong with her?

52
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:39,583
Looks like it tickled her.

53
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:41,666
But it's not the
reaction I was hoping for!

54
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,875
That's because you
were doing it wrong!

55
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:45,750
Listen. Tickling
is an art form.

56
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:47,708
Take a lesson from the master!

57
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:51,916
This is the proper technique!
Coochie-coochie-coochie-coo!

58
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,625
Now this should tickle!

59
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:57,625
Oh, Tomo! Okay, Tomo. That's
enough. You can stop now.

60
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:05,625
Oh, this is gonna suck!

61
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,708
Quit molesting
me, you pervert!

62
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,708
I'm confused. I
don't know what it's

63
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:15,416
going to take to
make myself smile.

64
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,833
Hey, I know!

65
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:20,166
What? You don't
know how to smile?

66
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,625
I was thinkin' maybe you
could give her some advice.

67
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:34,166
Gee, Mister Takehara,
weird much?!

68
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,375
Yeah, right?!

69
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:51,875
I guess there's no point
in asking someone who

70
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:55,458
never smiles himself.
Come on. Let's go, Alpha.

71
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:58,708
Is there anything
I haven't tried?

72
00:05:58,791 --> 00:05:59,708
Beats me.

73
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:01,791
Well what do we have here?

74
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:05,291
My favorite Angeloids,
Ikaros and Nymph.

75
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,958
So, you want to
learn how to smile?

76
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:12,958
Yes. I'm having a hard time.

77
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:16,541
So... Is there a specific
time of day you like to smile?

78
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:18,375
Or is there any
advice you could give us?

79
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:22,166
Let's see. Something that
always brings a smile to my face

80
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,458
is hitting someone
as hard as I can...

81
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:27,041
using a huge... flyswatter.

82
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:45,375
Stop it! I'm not a bug!

83
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:03,875
Tomoki?

84
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:06,500
Now that was funny as Hell.

85
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:14,208
I don't believe you.
How could you do that?

86
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:15,541
I'm sorry.

87
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:17,500
Oh please, Tomoki. It's
not like you were going to

88
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:19,791
die or anything,
who really cares?

89
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:23,791
I "really cares!" Ikaros is
a very impressionable person!

90
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:25,875
So did beating the
crap out of Tomoki get you

91
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:27,708
any closer to smiling?

92
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:31,458
Unfortunately, no.
Not yet, at least.

93
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,375
Oh right, I nearly forgot
what time of year it is.

94
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:36,791
It's almost Christmas.

95
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:39,625
Oh, I know! Why don't we
all get together this weekend

96
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:42,041
and throw a huge Christmas
party at Tomoki's place!

97
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:43,541
It would be so much fun!

98
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:46,500
But we all have to
pitch in for it to work.

99
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:49,875
Throw the best bash ever
and Ikaros has to smile!

100
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:50,875
Not bad.

101
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:52,125
That sounds like a plan.

102
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:54,291
You game, Tomoki?
What do you say?

103
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:57,291
I could get my mom to bake one
of her awesome cakes for us.

104
00:07:57,375 --> 00:08:00,541
And we could put up a bunch of
decorations and swap presents!

105
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:03,916
Uh, sure. I guess that's okay.

106
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,666
Alright then. This Sunday,
consider it a date. Okay?

107
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:13,541
What's wrong?
Why can't I smile?

108
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:19,250
It is weird.
I mean I took off your

109
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,666
emotional protections
a while ago.

110
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,416
But you have to remember
you were created for combat.

111
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,958
Maybe you're just
physically incapable of it.

112
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:30,500
I was created as a...
combat-only model?

113
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:33,250
Well... Smiling's pretty
simple once you get down to it.

114
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:35,000
I wouldn't stress too much.

115
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:42,291
It's not simple. I mean... I
don't think I can even remember

116
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:45,083
the last time I saw you smile.

117
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:49,291
What? What are
you tryin' to get at?

118
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:51,791
You haven't seemed
happy for a while.

119
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:09,000
Really. It's not like you to go
this much time without smiling.

120
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:13,333
It's been... too long.

121
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:19,041
It's true, yeah. Angeloids
are not designed for smiling,

122
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,041
not unless we have
humans around who are

123
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:22,833
willing to help us learn.

124
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:26,375
And there's something
else. Lately I've been doing

125
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:29,500
a lot of worrying.
More so than normal.

126
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:34,958
But the part that's
troubling me the most is

127
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,083
I don't know
why I'm worrying.

128
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,833
Everything will be
okay! We'll just nip this

129
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:44,333
problem in the bud.
Let's brainstorm.

130
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:47,875
I'm sure we can find a way
to make you smile. Sound good?

131
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:49,958
Sure.

132
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:59,583
Oh, holy crap. I am so hungry!
Morning! How's it goin'?

133
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,583
Hi... Master.

134
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:12,000
Master. Good morning. Relax.

135
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:13,750
Easy, Tomoki. Calm down.

136
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:16,208
She has wings for
crying out loud! Wings!

137
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:19,000
Is something...
bothering you, Master?

138
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:22,625
What? No! I mean,
your boobs freakin' awesome.

139
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:24,666
I mean, what
the heck'm I saying?

140
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,708
Must... control myself!

141
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:29,208
You're blushing, Master.

142
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:30,958
Huh? Me?

143
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:34,458
Wait. What the
Hell is going on?

144
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:37,166
What happened to
your face? It's frozen!

145
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:40,208
Dang, it didn't work! We spent
all last night putting glue on

146
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:42,458
our faces to freeze our
expressions for nothing.

147
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:43,916
You guys are out
of your damn minds!

148
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,291
Come on, let's go
wash that crap off.

149
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,458
Don't think I
didn't see that smile

150
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:51,875
on your face, 'cause I did.

151
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:53,416
Oh shut the Hell up!

152
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,125
Ever since the accident I feel
like you're afraid to smile.

153
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:57,958
I... I know...

154
00:10:58,041 --> 00:11:01,583
What if... I took you on a date?
We could do something simple,

155
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:03,000
like take a drive
in the country.

156
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:05,666
What is that
all about? A date?

157
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:12,291
Hey, Tomoki! I
have a great idea!

158
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:13,208
Oh?

159
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:16,333
We should all go on a date!

160
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:18,541
Whaaat?!

161
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,458
So, um... Do you even
understand what a date is?

162
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:32,000
Because most of the time.
it's something that a boy

163
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:34,250
and girl do together,
by themselves.

164
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:36,250
You mean we can't do
it with three people?

165
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:38,625
Well, we can
but it's not normal.

166
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:41,708
Then who cares? Don't you
remember what Sohara said?

167
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:43,791
If we do something fun
then the chances of Alpha

168
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:47,208
cracking a smile go
way up. She needs this.

169
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,833
What're we waiting
for? Let's do it!

170
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:55,041
A date with Master?
What is this feeling?

171
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:57,916
Am I actually... excited?

172
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,625
Ah, screw it. Come on,
ladies, let's get this

173
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:01,958
threesome on the road!

174
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:03,791
Yeah, so, what
do we do on a date?

175
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:06,125
Oh man, there's tons
of things you can do.

176
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:09,666
That's actually a
really good question which

177
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,500
I don't have the answer to.

178
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:14,291
Face it, Tomoki Sakurai.

179
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:16,583
You've never been
popular with the ladies.

180
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:19,375
But you can't let them know
this is your first real date!

181
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:21,416
Do not screw this up!

182
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:26,750
Gimme that! I gotta see!
"Try taking her shopping.

183
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:29,125
If you buy her something she
wants, her impression of you

184
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:32,166
will be very positive and
may lead to future intimacy."

185
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:37,833
Okay, my ladies! Anything
you want! I'll buy it for ya!

186
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:43,083
Jeez, Christmas really
snuck up on me this year.

187
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:47,375
Better start thinking of gift
ideas, for myself of course.

188
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:49,833
Master. I bought something.

189
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:52,791
Did you buy out the entire
freakin' grocery store?!

190
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:56,041
What about you, Nymph? Isn't
there anything you want to buy?

191
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:57,750
Figured you'd be all about it.

192
00:12:57,833 --> 00:13:00,791
Yeah, I thought about it,
but I think I'm good.

193
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:07,250
And anyways, it wouldn't really
mean much. But thanks though.

194
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,708
"After shopping, you
can relax at a nice movie.

195
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:16,416
Try to pick a sappy one
for optimum emotional impact."

196
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,250
Bunch of stuff playing.
What looks good to you guys?

197
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:22,000
How 'bout this one?

198
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:23,541
No freakin' way!

199
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:25,208
Why not? It looks
right up your alley.

200
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:27,291
This one looks interesting.

201
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:32,833
'Kay. Ix-nay on the
oovie-may, what else is there?

202
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:36,083
"If a movie's not your style,
and depending on your budget,

203
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:38,166
you might try
an amusement park."

204
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:46,750
The mascots are
not a threat to us!

205
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:50,333
Maybe this wasn't
the best place to start.

206
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:52,541
Let's check out
some rides instead.

207
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:02,083
Master... is having fun.

208
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:05,791
The world's spinnin' so
fast I think my brain's

209
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:08,125
gonna fly outta my ears!

210
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:11,625
That was a huge mistake.

211
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:13,250
Whoa, are you okay?

212
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:16,750
I'm having fun on
my date with Master.

213
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:20,041
But still,
something is missing.

214
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:23,166
You pathetic baby.
Come on, let's get going.

215
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:26,208
There's more fun to be
had. Suck it up, Tomoki.

216
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:37,000
Initiating scan. All
systems read zero damage.

217
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:38,833
No faults in the
organic structure.

218
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:42,458
No reactor anomalies.
All systems green.

219
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:47,166
What was that just now?
It was almost...

220
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:50,333
like a quick twinge
of pain in my reactor.

221
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:00,625
Wow, they're amazing!

222
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:03,041
Oh, good. She's finally
chilling out a bit.

223
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:06,208
I'm gonna go see if I can
find some tea or something.

224
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:14,125
You guys take your time.
I'll be back in a few minutes.

225
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:24,666
I wish... Tomoki were
my Master. But... he's not.

226
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,541
Hey, Alpha. I don't
understand this place.

227
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:33,958
Why are all the
animals in cages?

228
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:36,833
I don't know.

229
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:38,583
Here's what I'm thinking...

230
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:43,833
Maybe this cage is kinda
like the chokers we wear.

231
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:49,625
If that's true, they want out.

232
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:51,625
Wouldn't you agree, Alpha?

233
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:56,583
If these animals could leave
their cages and roam free,

234
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:58,958
think about how
much happier they'd be.

235
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,166
What?

236
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,416
Y'know, Tomoki does
so much for us.

237
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,875
Would it make him happy
if we set them loose?

238
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:07,125
I don't know, would he?

239
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:11,250
Master... would be thrilled.

240
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:13,750
Alpha. What if we...

241
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:19,208
Alpha! What're you doing?!

242
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:25,166
Master would be...

243
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:29,958
happy. So happy!

244
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:38,250
Gotta love peace and quiet.
There's nothing better.

245
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:48,458
Nooo! Why do I get
the feeling my dates have

246
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:50,250
something to do with this?!

247
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,500
Hey, get back here!
This is your fault!

248
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:59,458
Master would be so happy...

249
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,083
Master would be...

250
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:09,458
so happy.

251
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:15,000
Calm down! Don't panic!

252
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:17,750
We'll return the
animals to their cages!

253
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:25,833
Hello, police! We have
a naked man running around

254
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:27,916
the park tampering
with all the cages!

255
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:30,625
All units, proceed
to the scene immediately.

256
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:33,125
We have multiple dangerous
animals on the loose!

257
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,208
Must be some
new kinda terrorism!

258
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:37,541
Everyone on high alert!

259
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:41,250
The little bastards
playing with us! Damn it!

260
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:43,958
Really pour it on boys!
We're takin' back the peace!

261
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:50,916
Earlier today, a nude man
wreaked havoc on the city zoo,

262
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,416
sending the patrons
and staff into a frenzy.

263
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,166
I always assumed he'd end
up doing something like this.

264
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,666
Though he was actually
a really nice guy.

265
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:01,125
If it were me, I'd give him
the freakin' death penalty.

266
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:04,750
I'm innocent!

267
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:10,708
I am very sorry
about all of this, Master.

268
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:13,250
I'm done with this crap
day, I wanna go home!

269
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:15,625
We did plenty of
date stuff, let's call it.

270
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:18,125
No way! There's so many
other things we want to do.

271
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:20,000
You wanna do
more? Like what?

272
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:23,833
Are you insane?!

273
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:26,041
It says right here if the date
goes well you're supposed to

274
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:27,541
kiss each other at the end.

275
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:29,708
Yeah, if it goes well!
And you're only supposed to

276
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:31,916
kiss one person, not two!

277
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,208
Oh... So only one
of us will get a kiss.

278
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:39,541
Hey, Alpha...

279
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:45,291
You mind if I try it?
That's okay. Isn't it?

280
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,458
Wait! Listen
to me, both of you!

281
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:52,166
Tomoki...

282
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:03,333
Hey! Hold on,
where you going?!

283
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:06,166
You can't just leave
me here alone with her!

284
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:11,166
Crap... What should I do?

285
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:18,375
No wait! Stop!
I was just kidding!

286
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:20,625
Jeez I can't believe
you fell for it.

287
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:28,000
What is this feeling? Is it
because I'm thinking of Tomoki?

288
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:30,541
It's so strange!

289
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:35,625
Are you okay? Nymph?

290
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:39,541
It's nothing! My reactor's
just actin' a little weird!

291
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:41,958
Keep your paws off me creep-o!

292
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:43,833
Why'd you have to hit me?!

293
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:47,250
I've done...
something horrible.

294
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:50,833
'Scuse me? Hey, wait!

295
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:56,625
I'm so sorry, Alpha. All
I wanted was to make some

296
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:59,791
memories for myself
before it was too late.

297
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:01,833
But I realized
that I have enough.

298
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:06,000
Reactor scan. Functioning
at one-hundred percent.

299
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:13,125
The time I've spent with
you two has been amazing.

300
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:18,500
Sure it was short, but so
sweet. And don't worry, Alpha.

301
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:22,250
Even if you can't smile, as
long as Tomoki is your Master,

302
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:26,833
he'll care about you more
and more each day. Forever.

303
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:37,833
My reactor must
be damaged. It hurts.

304
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:49,666
What is with you?
You up and fly away,

305
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,500
and you come
back totally filthy.

306
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,291
I'm sorry, Master.

307
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,083
And Nymph ran off pouting too.

308
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:57,208
What the Hell
is going on today?

309
00:20:57,291 --> 00:20:59,500
Today was when I
went on my first date

310
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:01,833
and wasn't even
able to smile.

311
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,875
Come on. Let's go home.
The rules say the date

312
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:15,500
doesn't end until
I drop you off.

313
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,208
All right.

314
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,541
It looks like you're free
to roam now. Glad to see it.

315
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:50,125
So long you guys.
Tomoki. Alpha.

316
00:23:17,541 --> 00:23:20,541
All right then.
Where should I go?

317
00:23:20,625 --> 00:23:25,083
The sea? Or maybe a
deserted spot in the mountains?

318
00:23:25,166 --> 00:23:27,708
I'm sure as long as I go
somewhere quiet and disappear,

319
00:23:27,791 --> 00:23:30,083
no one will notice I'm gone.

320
00:23:30,666 --> 00:23:32,958
Or maybe it would be
funny if I headed back to

321
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:35,625
the Synapse with,
oh I don't know,

322
00:23:35,708 --> 00:23:37,791
a bomb or something like that.

323
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:40,708
Wonder what Master
would think of me then.

324
00:24:01,833 --> 00:24:03,000
It's Gamma!

325
00:24:04,083 --> 00:24:06,791
Next time...
"Queen of the Sky."
