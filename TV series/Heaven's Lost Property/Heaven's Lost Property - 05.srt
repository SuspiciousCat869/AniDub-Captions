1
00:00:39,112 --> 00:00:40,155
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:41,322 --> 00:00:43,908
You know me. My name
is Eishirou Sugata.

3
00:00:43,992 --> 00:00:46,202
I'm currently seeking
a new assistant.

4
00:00:46,828 --> 00:00:48,955
In the Age of Discovery,
Ferdinand Magellan found

5
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,957
something significant.
The southern route to

6
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:53,710
circumnavigate the globe.
It was his crowning achievement

7
00:00:53,793 --> 00:00:56,296
that using his contemporary
ships' logs, he was able to

8
00:00:56,379 --> 00:00:58,965
prove that the earth
was, in fact, round.

9
00:00:59,049 --> 00:01:01,676
This caused a ripple of panic
to course through the network of

10
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,471
cartographers of the time. After
all, it completely destroyed

11
00:01:04,554 --> 00:01:07,307
their concept of the
known world. And their maps.

12
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:10,310
I believe this type of discovery
could happen again now.

13
00:01:10,393 --> 00:01:13,188
If we could just somehow
seek out this New World.

14
00:01:13,688 --> 00:01:17,067
On a side note, Magellan's log
also made note of "footprints

15
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:21,363
of giants" near Patagonia.
The possibility exists that

16
00:01:21,446 --> 00:01:23,698
whatever he saw,
still lives on an island

17
00:01:23,782 --> 00:01:25,867
somewhere to this very day.

18
00:01:27,285 --> 00:01:31,289
What about you? Would you
like to be my new assistant?

19
00:03:04,674 --> 00:03:07,093
We're almost to
summer vacation, Ikaros.

20
00:03:07,177 --> 00:03:09,012
And it's getting way
hot. I think maybe we're

21
00:03:09,095 --> 00:03:11,222
gonna have to buy
an air conditioner.

22
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:14,100
Master, in looking around
us, I think we need to

23
00:03:14,184 --> 00:03:16,728
sort out our
living conditions first.

24
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:19,647
You might have a point.
The entire house went "boom"

25
00:03:19,731 --> 00:03:22,317
thanks to all those
damn exploding panties.

26
00:03:24,944 --> 00:03:26,780
Hey, I got it! Why
don't we just go stay at

27
00:03:26,863 --> 00:03:29,866
Sugata's place again!
That wasn't so bad.

28
00:03:35,622 --> 00:03:37,207
Yo! Sugata!

29
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,460
Sorry to drop this
on you out of nowhere,

30
00:03:40,543 --> 00:03:42,629
but do you mind if we
stay here for a while?

31
00:03:42,712 --> 00:03:44,464
Sure, knock
yourselves out, you two.

32
00:03:44,547 --> 00:03:47,175
Seriously? Score!

33
00:03:47,258 --> 00:03:49,302
I can't guarantee
your safety, though.

34
00:03:50,178 --> 00:03:52,180
Watch out! Behind you!

35
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,312
Bears are all over these
parts this time of year.

36
00:03:59,396 --> 00:04:01,231
You really have
to watch your backs.

37
00:04:02,065 --> 00:04:04,025
This sucks out
loud! I'm gonna die

38
00:04:04,109 --> 00:04:06,736
a miserable
death if I stay here!

39
00:04:07,946 --> 00:04:10,240
No way. You stay here and
you'll just go sifting through

40
00:04:10,323 --> 00:04:12,659
my drawers looking
for panties or some crap.

41
00:04:12,742 --> 00:04:14,577
I already said you
could stay at my place.

42
00:04:14,661 --> 00:04:16,287
And get eaten by bears!

43
00:04:16,371 --> 00:04:18,498
Yeah, whatever,
you probably deserve it.

44
00:04:18,581 --> 00:04:20,250
You are such a witch!
Childhood friends should

45
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:22,502
help each other out, not
wish death upon each other!

46
00:04:22,585 --> 00:04:24,087
Can you promise not to
steal my panties even if

47
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:26,464
you're in my room with
the perfect opportunity?

48
00:04:27,215 --> 00:04:29,759
Uh... Sure.
You can count on me.

49
00:04:29,843 --> 00:04:31,011
I don't buy it.

50
00:04:32,429 --> 00:04:35,181
Isn't this some joyful banter?
What are we doing today?

51
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,685
Really? Well,
if that's the case

52
00:04:38,768 --> 00:04:40,353
you're welcome
to stay at my house.

53
00:04:40,437 --> 00:04:41,563
What?

54
00:04:41,646 --> 00:04:43,189
I'll be the sweetest
host you could ever hope

55
00:04:43,273 --> 00:04:44,691
to have keep you.

56
00:04:44,774 --> 00:04:47,027
Her place is huge, right?
People are always saying it's

57
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:49,070
like the biggest one
in town or something.

58
00:04:49,154 --> 00:04:51,364
Her family are the
big shots in Sorami!

59
00:04:51,448 --> 00:04:53,783
And why not bring
along Sohara and Sugata

60
00:04:53,867 --> 00:04:56,119
until your house
gets fixed. It'll be fun.

61
00:04:56,202 --> 00:04:58,496
Now that sounds like the life.

62
00:05:08,048 --> 00:05:09,174
We'll do it!

63
00:05:09,257 --> 00:05:11,676
Excellent. Well,
that settles it then.

64
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,803
Why don't we get
your things moved in.

65
00:05:13,887 --> 00:05:15,388
I'll be heading
back to my tent.

66
00:05:15,472 --> 00:05:17,307
Dude! What's
your problem, Sugata?!

67
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:19,851
The mopey routine
just isn't your style!

68
00:05:19,934 --> 00:05:21,895
Movin' up to the Big Time!

69
00:05:26,441 --> 00:05:29,402
I am Mikako's father.
I invite you to stay with us

70
00:05:29,486 --> 00:05:31,029
for as long as you wish.

71
00:05:34,657 --> 00:05:37,744
The Satsukitane family has
been Sorami City's ruling clan

72
00:05:37,827 --> 00:05:41,206
since way back in the Edo period
when it was just an inn town.

73
00:05:41,706 --> 00:05:44,876
So that's what you meant when
you called her family big shots.

74
00:05:45,627 --> 00:05:47,170
That's about the shape of it.

75
00:05:48,505 --> 00:05:51,049
You guys look freaked. There's
nothing to be scared about,

76
00:05:51,132 --> 00:05:53,259
I promise. As long
as you don't break any

77
00:05:53,343 --> 00:05:56,179
of the very specific
rules, you'll be fine.

78
00:06:06,231 --> 00:06:07,691
She's sorry!
Really, really sorry!

79
00:06:07,774 --> 00:06:11,277
She's just a freakin' idiot.
Please spare her life, sir!

80
00:06:16,658 --> 00:06:18,743
Hey, no big deal!

81
00:06:20,412 --> 00:06:22,872
What are you all
doing standing around?

82
00:06:22,956 --> 00:06:24,749
Hurry up and tend
to our honored guests.

83
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:26,501
Yes, right away, sir!

84
00:06:32,173 --> 00:06:33,675
What a spread!

85
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:35,677
Sir, please try some of this.

86
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,846
Perhaps you'd
like some of mine, sir.

87
00:06:37,929 --> 00:06:40,682
Have you noticed how they
keep calling Sugata "sir?"

88
00:06:40,765 --> 00:06:43,643
Maybe... I dunno, 'cause
like, the Prez and him are

89
00:06:43,727 --> 00:06:46,771
old childhood
friends or, I dunno...

90
00:06:50,483 --> 00:06:51,735
Would you like to take a walk?

91
00:06:51,818 --> 00:06:52,902
What, are you serious?!

92
00:07:01,619 --> 00:07:06,374
Can't do this anymore.
I can't eat another thing.

93
00:07:08,084 --> 00:07:09,377
Where's Master?

94
00:07:09,461 --> 00:07:11,171
Ran off to take a bath.
Guess all that eating

95
00:07:11,254 --> 00:07:12,297
got him all messy.

96
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:13,757
Seriously? He went to bathe?

97
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,383
Yeah, why, is that a problem?

98
00:07:15,467 --> 00:07:18,428
No. But it could be. The
Satsukitane family has something

99
00:07:18,511 --> 00:07:22,182
called the "Decapitation Bath."
It's open only to clan members.

100
00:07:23,141 --> 00:07:25,352
He should be fine.
As long as Tomoki doesn't

101
00:07:25,435 --> 00:07:27,896
try to enter
that particular bath.

102
00:07:32,776 --> 00:07:33,860
Oh.

103
00:07:35,278 --> 00:07:38,907
Hello... So you
wanna hop in with me?

104
00:07:39,574 --> 00:07:42,744
I mean I don't mind. But
it might be kinda weird.

105
00:07:42,827 --> 00:07:44,162
No! It's cool!

106
00:07:44,245 --> 00:07:46,206
You're actually much more
forward than I would have

107
00:07:46,289 --> 00:07:49,000
given you credit for.
I mean, just walking in here

108
00:07:49,084 --> 00:07:50,126
the way you did...

109
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:51,294
N-No!

110
00:07:54,881 --> 00:07:57,133
Sorry about this, though.

111
00:07:58,134 --> 00:08:00,345
Gotta tell ya
somethin' serious.

112
00:08:01,554 --> 00:08:04,849
You really should hurry up
and get the Hell out of here.

113
00:08:04,933 --> 00:08:07,686
Before someone kills
you where you stand.

114
00:08:09,312 --> 00:08:10,230
Oh, god!

115
00:08:11,398 --> 00:08:12,941
Intruder alarm!
We have an intruder alarm!

116
00:08:13,024 --> 00:08:17,320
There is an intruder in the
Decapitation Bath! After him!

117
00:08:20,782 --> 00:08:21,991
There he is!

118
00:08:23,785 --> 00:08:25,203
Get back here!

119
00:08:25,286 --> 00:08:27,622
You really think
you can get away?!

120
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:30,083
These jerks
are gonna kill me!

121
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:34,921
Holy crap. Holy crap.
Mister, you gotta help.

122
00:08:35,005 --> 00:08:37,090
Please don't let
those dudes kill me!

123
00:08:37,173 --> 00:08:40,385
I am sorry, young man. But
no matter how close of friends

124
00:08:40,468 --> 00:08:44,556
you are with my daughter, our
law on this matter is absolute.

125
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:45,765
Do it!

126
00:08:47,058 --> 00:08:48,351
Tomoki!

127
00:08:49,477 --> 00:08:51,187
Why is this happening?!

128
00:08:51,646 --> 00:08:54,566
The Decapitation Bath
was originally a bath for

129
00:08:54,649 --> 00:08:57,402
our ancestor,
a celestial maiden.

130
00:08:57,902 --> 00:09:01,114
It was a place where she
could cleanse her divine robe.

131
00:09:01,448 --> 00:09:04,534
But after her passing, the
bath was opened to the public,

132
00:09:04,617 --> 00:09:07,287
and Sorami was
punished for doing so.

133
00:09:07,787 --> 00:09:11,416
Earthquakes...
famine... tornadoes.

134
00:09:11,499 --> 00:09:14,336
The disasters never ceased
until every single person

135
00:09:14,419 --> 00:09:17,380
who had visited the
bath was decapitated.

136
00:09:17,922 --> 00:09:20,633
Since that time, our
clan has had the honor of

137
00:09:20,717 --> 00:09:23,595
watching over this bath
with utmost vigilance...

138
00:09:23,678 --> 00:09:26,473
in order to protect
this fair town of Sorami.

139
00:09:28,558 --> 00:09:32,228
Given his friendship with
Mikako, end his life quickly.

140
00:09:33,438 --> 00:09:34,397
Sir.

141
00:09:34,481 --> 00:09:35,482
You can't do this!

142
00:09:35,565 --> 00:09:37,484
Mikako, please make them stop!

143
00:09:37,567 --> 00:09:40,862
I cannot. Laws in the
Satsukitane family are absolute.

144
00:09:40,945 --> 00:09:44,616
Nothing I say would change
their minds. But Sugata...

145
00:09:44,699 --> 00:09:46,910
You might be able to.

146
00:09:49,996 --> 00:09:53,208
Stop this now! If you take
one more step then I'll--

147
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:54,959
Oh, my young Sugata.

148
00:09:55,043 --> 00:09:58,922
Do you intend on defying
the Satsukitane family?

149
00:10:08,723 --> 00:10:09,808
This can't be happening.

150
00:10:09,891 --> 00:10:11,810
No, please! Please
don't kill my friend!

151
00:10:11,893 --> 00:10:14,312
You're in my way...
Take a hike, princess.

152
00:10:22,737 --> 00:10:26,282
Stop this. What are
you doing to my Master?

153
00:10:27,784 --> 00:10:32,580
I asked you a question, and
I expect a satisfactory answer.

154
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,855
Ikaros! Stop it, now!

155
00:11:16,374 --> 00:11:19,169
I apologize for all the
trouble we've caused you.

156
00:11:20,211 --> 00:11:23,423
Forget it. I'll overlook
everything that happened today

157
00:11:23,506 --> 00:11:25,467
on account of that young lady.

158
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:28,845
It appears she's not someone
we should be taking lightly.

159
00:11:29,637 --> 00:11:31,473
C'mon, let's get out of here.

160
00:11:31,556 --> 00:11:33,600
Understood, Master.

161
00:11:34,476 --> 00:11:36,144
And don't worry
about any of this.

162
00:11:36,227 --> 00:11:37,395
I won't.

163
00:11:41,816 --> 00:11:44,152
Mikako. I am going
to leave the rest of

164
00:11:44,235 --> 00:11:46,363
this matter in your hands.

165
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:48,782
Thank you.

166
00:11:53,036 --> 00:11:56,539
Rise and shine!
Good morning, everyone!

167
00:12:00,085 --> 00:12:01,628
Yeah, good
morning to you, too.

168
00:12:01,711 --> 00:12:03,922
We're almost there, so
you better wake the heck up.

169
00:12:04,005 --> 00:12:04,714
Where?

170
00:12:04,798 --> 00:12:06,591
To the uninhabited island.

171
00:12:13,973 --> 00:12:17,268
What the Hell is going on?!

172
00:12:27,904 --> 00:12:31,324
Wow, it's... Gorgeous!

173
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,160
This is a private
island owned by my family.

174
00:12:34,244 --> 00:12:36,830
I want you all to treat
this place as your own home.

175
00:12:36,913 --> 00:12:38,998
Just outta curiosity,
why'd you drag us to

176
00:12:39,082 --> 00:12:40,542
the middle of nowhere anyway?

177
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:43,336
Because a certain someone
broke a sacred family law which

178
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:46,715
has made it all a wee bit tense
staying back at the main house.

179
00:12:47,173 --> 00:12:49,509
I would've felt awful tossin'
you out onto the street,

180
00:12:49,592 --> 00:12:51,636
so I brought you here
instead. I hope that wasn't

181
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:55,306
the wrong thing to do.
I could always take you back.

182
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:57,475
No, this is great.
Seriously, thanks.

183
00:12:57,559 --> 00:12:58,810
You've gone really
far out of your way

184
00:12:58,893 --> 00:13:00,562
for Tomoki, haven't you?

185
00:13:01,062 --> 00:13:04,482
Tomo! You better show her
some pretty serious gratitude!

186
00:13:04,566 --> 00:13:06,276
Thank you, Prez.

187
00:13:06,609 --> 00:13:08,486
You're welcome, Tomoki.

188
00:13:11,573 --> 00:13:13,491
Well, since we're here...
Let's go swimming!

189
00:13:13,575 --> 00:13:14,868
Hold off for a second.

190
00:13:15,827 --> 00:13:17,787
Don't underestimate
uninhabited islands.

191
00:13:17,871 --> 00:13:19,706
Before anything, we need
to secure a food source

192
00:13:19,789 --> 00:13:20,957
for our survival.

193
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:23,543
What? Mikako said this
is her family's island.

194
00:13:23,626 --> 00:13:25,712
Isn't there some
kinda cottage or bungalow?

195
00:13:25,795 --> 00:13:28,089
Actually we've
got nothing at all.

196
00:13:28,715 --> 00:13:31,301
And that's our situation.
So we can't afford to

197
00:13:31,384 --> 00:13:32,927
spend time sunning
and swimming.

198
00:13:33,011 --> 00:13:35,555
Why don't we leave finding
the food to Ikaros and Tomoki.

199
00:13:35,638 --> 00:13:38,141
The rest of us will head out to
look for fresh drinking water.

200
00:13:38,224 --> 00:13:39,934
Sure, sounds good.

201
00:13:41,686 --> 00:13:42,562
Hey, Ikaros.

202
00:13:43,229 --> 00:13:44,689
Yes, Master?

203
00:13:44,773 --> 00:13:46,524
Think maybe you should jump
in the water and catch us some

204
00:13:46,608 --> 00:13:49,611
bream or tuna or something
tasty? Whadda ya say?

205
00:13:49,986 --> 00:13:51,446
Yes, Master.

206
00:13:51,529 --> 00:13:54,032
Make sure you catch some fat
ones with a lotta meat on 'em.

207
00:13:54,115 --> 00:13:55,617
Yes, Master.

208
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:05,043
Cool! I found a coconut crab!

209
00:14:05,126 --> 00:14:08,338
Coconut crab sounds awesome.
I've always wanted to try one!

210
00:14:08,421 --> 00:14:09,881
Here goes!

211
00:14:13,218 --> 00:14:14,761
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
Please forgive me!

212
00:14:14,844 --> 00:14:16,930
I don't wanna
eat you! I don't!

213
00:14:21,893 --> 00:14:24,396
This sucks balls. On the
verge of death 'cause of

214
00:14:24,479 --> 00:14:28,316
some stupid crab. Maybe
we eat vegetarian this trip.

215
00:14:30,735 --> 00:14:32,779
Man, I'm freakin' starvin'.

216
00:14:34,614 --> 00:14:37,617
Okay. Clearly these
mushrooms are a bad idea.

217
00:14:37,701 --> 00:14:39,744
Oh, well... No choice.

218
00:14:43,998 --> 00:14:49,295
No way, sista! Shut up!
Grandpa! Grandpa!

219
00:15:03,727 --> 00:15:07,188
Holy crap, musta passed
out after eatin' that thing.

220
00:15:13,153 --> 00:15:14,696
What the Hell is this?

221
00:15:17,198 --> 00:15:18,116
Save me!

222
00:15:18,199 --> 00:15:19,826
So-Sohara?!

223
00:15:26,332 --> 00:15:29,377
Oh my gosh, no! Sohara!

224
00:15:31,671 --> 00:15:34,299
How did you get down
here?! Are you okay?

225
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:38,845
I'm glad you're safe.
I was starting to

226
00:15:38,928 --> 00:15:40,472
get so worried about you.

227
00:15:41,014 --> 00:15:43,725
What happened? I thought
you were with the others.

228
00:15:43,808 --> 00:15:44,809
Where are they?!

229
00:15:44,893 --> 00:15:46,061
I don't know what
happened to them.

230
00:15:46,144 --> 00:15:48,605
Once we started running
we all got separated.

231
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:52,942
What's that?

232
00:15:54,444 --> 00:15:56,780
That sound was chasing us,
so we ran as fast as we could.

233
00:15:56,863 --> 00:15:58,615
I'm scared, Tomoki!

234
00:15:59,366 --> 00:16:02,077
We'll find a safe place to hide
and sort out what's going on.

235
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,912
Calm down,
Sohara, I've got you.

236
00:16:03,995 --> 00:16:04,871
'Kay...

237
00:16:06,081 --> 00:16:07,415
We're gonna be fine.
When the sun comes up,

238
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:10,085
we'll go search for
everyone else. Cool?

239
00:16:10,168 --> 00:16:11,503
Cool.

240
00:16:15,715 --> 00:16:17,425
When morning broke,
we went looking for

241
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:19,719
Prez, Sugata, and Ikaros.

242
00:16:20,261 --> 00:16:23,390
But one day turned into two,
then turned into three, four,

243
00:16:23,473 --> 00:16:26,267
who knows how many.
We never found them.

244
00:16:26,976 --> 00:16:28,978
At night, we kept
hearing that howl.

245
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:31,606
That awful, terrifying howl.

246
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,733
Tomo, what if
they're all dead?

247
00:16:33,817 --> 00:16:36,403
What if they got eaten
by that horrible thing?

248
00:16:36,486 --> 00:16:39,197
They'll be fine.
I just know it.

249
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,241
No way they'd
go down so easy.

250
00:16:41,324 --> 00:16:42,617
Guess you're right.

251
00:16:43,326 --> 00:16:45,078
I mean, I'm sure Prez
would've called for help

252
00:16:45,161 --> 00:16:46,955
on her radio by now.

253
00:16:47,914 --> 00:16:48,915
Yeah.

254
00:16:57,799 --> 00:16:58,842
Check it out!

255
00:17:00,051 --> 00:17:02,345
Wow! That's a pretty
big catch for breakfast!

256
00:17:02,429 --> 00:17:04,389
Just hand 'em over
and I'll cook 'em up!

257
00:17:04,472 --> 00:17:06,766
Cool. Sounds good to me.

258
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:08,184
You want one bowl or two?

259
00:17:08,268 --> 00:17:10,812
And so, an entire month passed.
The two of us completely

260
00:17:10,895 --> 00:17:12,897
readjusted to
life on the island.

261
00:17:13,231 --> 00:17:15,400
Sohara even
started smiling again.

262
00:17:17,277 --> 00:17:19,696
But just when I started thinking
it wouldn't be all bad if

263
00:17:19,779 --> 00:17:21,865
things went on
like this forever...

264
00:17:31,249 --> 00:17:33,209
What's the matter?
You all right?

265
00:17:34,377 --> 00:17:37,297
I'm sorry... I just...
I started thinking about

266
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:40,050
everybody else
and got kinda sad.

267
00:17:41,134 --> 00:17:43,887
It makes me wonder...
What's gonna happen if no one

268
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:48,099
ever comes to rescue us?
Will we just live here forever?

269
00:17:51,311 --> 00:17:52,854
I guess we'll have
to make the most of

270
00:17:52,937 --> 00:17:54,731
the time we have together.

271
00:17:54,814 --> 00:17:56,107
Hm?

272
00:17:56,191 --> 00:17:58,526
But with me here, at
least you won't be lonely.

273
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:03,073
And I promise you now,
you'll never be sad.

274
00:18:03,156 --> 00:18:05,075
Thank you, Tomoki.

275
00:18:16,252 --> 00:18:18,380
And you know... I'm
thinkin' life wouldn't be

276
00:18:18,463 --> 00:18:21,549
near as depressing as
it is now if we had kids.

277
00:18:22,217 --> 00:18:24,636
You wanna have kids?!
You mean like, now?

278
00:18:25,053 --> 00:18:29,140
No! That's not what I was trying
to say at all! I meant, uh...

279
00:18:35,522 --> 00:18:38,274
Um... Sohara...

280
00:18:39,776 --> 00:18:42,737
I... It's okay, Tomoki.

281
00:19:01,423 --> 00:19:03,133
We gotta get outta here!

282
00:19:03,216 --> 00:19:04,426
Yeah!

283
00:19:08,555 --> 00:19:09,889
Sohara!

284
00:19:14,436 --> 00:19:16,771
Dammit legs, you have to move!

285
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:19,941
You hear me?! I said move!

286
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:21,234
Tomoki...

287
00:19:22,402 --> 00:19:25,697
Don't worry about
me... I promise...

288
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:29,409
I'll be just fine. I will.

289
00:19:37,167 --> 00:19:42,172
Sohara! I'm coming!
Let her go, monster!

290
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,761
Let go of her, dammit!

291
00:19:50,764 --> 00:19:54,642
Let her go! Let her go!

292
00:19:54,726 --> 00:19:58,772
Get your tentacles off
her, you damn dirty beast!

293
00:20:12,243 --> 00:20:15,455
I have returned with a
fish, Master. I did not find

294
00:20:15,538 --> 00:20:18,083
many schools of tuna out
here, so I crossed over to

295
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:20,251
the southern hemisphere
to find this one.

296
00:20:20,335 --> 00:20:24,756
Tomo... I think... this is
just seaweed and oysters.

297
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:27,050
It's what?! So they were
just stuck all over Ikaros,

298
00:20:27,133 --> 00:20:28,760
like barnacles or something?

299
00:20:28,843 --> 00:20:31,304
Yes. As I walked
along the ocean floor,

300
00:20:31,388 --> 00:20:34,140
all of that became stuck
to me for some reason.

301
00:20:34,641 --> 00:20:37,018
So what was that blood-curdling
howl you let out?

302
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:39,020
And where are the others?

303
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:40,855
Master, do you wish
for me to check for

304
00:20:40,939 --> 00:20:42,774
their life signs on my radar?

305
00:20:42,857 --> 00:20:44,651
Yes! Please do.

306
00:20:44,734 --> 00:20:45,777
One moment.

307
00:21:08,633 --> 00:21:12,470
Ha! Now that's entertainment!
It's also your punishment for

308
00:21:12,554 --> 00:21:14,973
breaking the rules of
my family. And with that,

309
00:21:15,056 --> 00:21:16,433
I will exonerate you.

310
00:21:16,891 --> 00:21:19,728
And I promise you
now, you'll never be sad.

311
00:21:20,895 --> 00:21:23,148
Thank you, Tomoki.

312
00:21:24,441 --> 00:21:26,651
Oh, to be young and in love.

313
00:21:26,735 --> 00:21:28,737
Well... I think it had
more to do with the fact that

314
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,822
his life had
recently been spared.

315
00:21:30,905 --> 00:21:33,616
You're telling me all
this crap. All this happened

316
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:36,077
because of something
Tomoki did again?!

317
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:38,621
Whoa! Just calm down, Sohara!

318
00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:41,124
This whole thing
was your fault, Tomo!

319
00:21:41,207 --> 00:21:44,127
You're the biggest
jerkwad on Planet Earth!

320
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:47,255
Somebody help me!

321
00:21:52,093 --> 00:21:55,722
It's like my house never
even exploded! What the Hell?

322
00:21:56,056 --> 00:21:57,891
Master, look over there.

323
00:21:58,516 --> 00:22:00,852
Present Ikaros greeting!

324
00:22:00,935 --> 00:22:02,103
Hello.

325
00:22:03,897 --> 00:22:07,275
Please accept this
small token. A gift from the

326
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:10,320
entire Satsukitane
family... to you.

327
00:22:10,403 --> 00:22:11,571
You may not have known this,

328
00:22:11,654 --> 00:22:14,032
but strength counts for
everything in my family.

329
00:22:14,699 --> 00:22:16,076
And it looks like
my father has grown

330
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:18,161
rather attached
to Ikaros here.

331
00:24:00,555 --> 00:24:02,265
May I have your
attention, please.

332
00:24:02,349 --> 00:24:04,142
Here's today's announcements:

333
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:08,146
And I promise you now,
you'll never be sad.

334
00:24:11,107 --> 00:24:13,360
Thank you, Tomoki.

335
00:24:13,777 --> 00:24:17,489
Next time... "Swimsuit
Surf Brigade, Go! Go! Go!"
