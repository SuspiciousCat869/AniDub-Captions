1
00:00:30,708 --> 00:00:31,791
Umako, hear me out!

2
00:00:31,875 --> 00:00:33,958
Don't come any
closer! You hear me?

3
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:37,041
These soaps are really growing
on me. They're so engrossing.

4
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:40,041
Sure I was having some issues
before, but they're long gone.

5
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:43,041
No. Run away with me
and we can be together!

6
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:46,125
It makes me happy to hear
you say that, but I'm sorry.

7
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:48,208
I just can't.
It's just not possible!

8
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:50,833
I don't give a damn about
the Count and his power.

9
00:00:50,916 --> 00:00:52,125
All that should
matter is how...

10
00:00:52,208 --> 00:00:56,416
I want... I really want
to hold Master's hand.

11
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:29,291
Culture. The Age of
Exploration heralded the start

12
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:31,625
of a new age
of cultural trade.

13
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:36,250
During this era... the
Europeans became aware of

14
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:39,958
countless other peoples
and cultures. Of course...

15
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:42,791
they viewed the inhabitants
of the Americas as savages,

16
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:45,333
but they were fascinated by
the enormity of their culture

17
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:47,166
and the wealth they possessed.

18
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,958
If this sounds like a certain
Angeloid who insists on

19
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:52,750
referring to humans as
"bugs," you'd be correct.

20
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:55,958
She may see us as insects,
yet she is still drawn to us.

21
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:59,250
Yes, I'm with you! You're
referring to Nymph, aren't you?

22
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:01,250
Because that doesn't
really sound like Ikaros.

23
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:02,708
Yes, Mikako.

24
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:09,833
Fascinating, isn't it?

25
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:15,458
Et tu, pooch?
You're in on this too?

26
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,875
Hey look, it's time for
the Cultural Fair again.

27
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:25,375
Am I supposed to
know what that is?

28
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:27,916
It's something we do with
the private high school in town.

29
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,541
All the different classes
and clubs set up booths.

30
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:33,125
They put on plays and concerts,
ya know, stuff like that.

31
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:34,416
Oh.

32
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:41,916
Master, will you be
taking part in the fair too?

33
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,750
No... it's a pain in my
ass... Only way I would is if

34
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:47,416
my class forced me to join.
Way I see it, I'm not in

35
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,583
any clubs so why
should I even bother?

36
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:53,625
I've been waiting for you,
Tomoki. We have a plan in

37
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:56,583
the New World
Discovery Club. Look...

38
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:58,500
We are currently
recruiting skilled pilots.

39
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:00,083
Screw you!

40
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:02,166
Don't say that. You should be
honored to even be considered

41
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,083
given how many members
we have in the running.

42
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:05,750
Now wait just a damn minute!

43
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:07,666
When the Hell did I
ever join your club, huh?

44
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,916
Well, according to the
student council registry,

45
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
we have you down as
a card-carrying member.

46
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:14,333
Conspiracy! Someone's
out to get me, I swear!

47
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:17,958
Wow. These poor,
depraved children.

48
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,666
What a pathetic
excuse for an event.

49
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,666
Look, Yoshitsune. They put a
banner up for the Cultural Fair.

50
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,958
I'm surprised they could
afford that, let alone pay for

51
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:29,250
the fair. Do they even know the
meaning of the word "culture?"

52
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:31,791
It's those face-turds
from the Academy!

53
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:34,750
They think
highly of themselves.

54
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:37,750
They're from Sorami Academy,
the private school I mentioned.

55
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:40,458
The only reason we team up
with them to put on this fair

56
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:42,041
is 'cause our
school is so small,

57
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:43,625
being out here in the sticks.

58
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:47,958
They don't seem very friendly.

59
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:49,833
Time to watch the sparks fly.

60
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:53,375
My goodness, Tsukino.
Are you seeing this?

61
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:55,750
They're actually making
flowers out of cardboard.

62
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:59,000
It begs the question, can these
cavepeople demonstrate culture

63
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:01,000
when they've barely
discovered how to make fire?

64
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:02,916
Stupid yuppies! If you're
so great, what the Hell

65
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,583
are you doin' for the festival
this year? Let me guess.

66
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:06,875
Something big and
flashy with no character?

67
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:09,250
Well... we have
something in the works, yes.

68
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,375
We will be
performing the classics.

69
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:15,458
That's the dumbest
idea I've ever heard!

70
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:16,916
Did you hear that Sohara?

71
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,791
They're gonna put on
some lame-ass boring play,

72
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:20,666
as if anybody would
want to see that crap!

73
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,083
Why not just play
a tape of Shakespeare

74
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:24,250
while you're at it,
you friggin' rich idiots!

75
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,958
He wasn't referring
to the theatre.

76
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:29,291
You are such a moron,
Tomo. He was talking about

77
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:30,916
doing classical music.

78
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,500
The poor cretin's never
heard of classical music?

79
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,208
It almost makes me
feel bad for him.

80
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:37,750
Come on everyone,
we better be on our way.

81
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:40,791
I'm afraid the lack
of civility may infect us.

82
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:42,916
Way to go, genius! That
big mouth of yours just put

83
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,500
an even bigger
target on our backs!

84
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:48,083
Damn! They just
declared war, Sohara.

85
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:49,916
Now we have to do
something for the fair.

86
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,666
Yeah, I saw that.
Any bright ideas?

87
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,500
Well, we could...
I got nothin'.

88
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:58,750
Attention everyone.
The Prez has arrived.

89
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:03,750
As your Class President,
I cannot allow this injustice

90
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:05,666
to stand another moment.

91
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:08,291
If they're going to
attack us with music,

92
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:10,916
then we shall
retaliate with music.

93
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:14,041
What do you say?
Wanna start a band?

94
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:16,041
A band, like
with instruments?

95
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:20,875
How the Hell is she
getting a tambourine to

96
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:22,458
make a sound like that?

97
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,833
This is hopeless. There's no
way all of us talentless hacks

98
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:37,708
will figure it out. But, what
other choice do we have?

99
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:50,166
Master's hand... All I want to
do is hold it, but how? I know!

100
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,666
I'll try really hard
to play this tambourine

101
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,583
and when he tells me how
good I did, I'll grab it.

102
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:08,958
Nymph, that was awesome!

103
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:09,958
Huh?

104
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:11,833
You know you
are really talented!

105
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:15,125
I had no idea you had an
aptitude for music, Nymph.

106
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:17,916
Well, I'm good with
machines so maybe that's why.

107
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,208
If we can somehow base the song
off of whatever you're playing,

108
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:23,625
it won't sound so
much like we're winging it.

109
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:26,291
Now we're cooking! Let's
show those private school

110
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:28,333
douchebags a thing or two!

111
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:32,291
I just want you to know we'll
all be depending on you, Nymph.

112
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:34,208
But to be perfectly honest
I'm not that interested

113
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:35,750
in being in a band.

114
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:38,333
But since I'm just killing time,
I may as well help you out.

115
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,083
Sweet! Thank you!

116
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:47,958
The students from Sorami Academy
have decided to pick a fight

117
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:49,875
with us at the
Cultural Fair this year.

118
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:52,166
Therefore, by extension
they have picked a fight with

119
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:56,666
the Satsukitane family.
Of course... you realize...

120
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:59,083
This means war.

121
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:02,541
And that is how Mikako
started her very own PR firm,

122
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:05,500
with special thanks to
the Satsukitane family...

123
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:07,583
Almost immediately,
Sorami High's attendance

124
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:09,708
to the fair
began to skyrocket.

125
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:14,083
In direct opposition, the
Academy's PTA board called for

126
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:17,000
an emergency rally to
garner support for their side.

127
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:19,916
By pooling their money, they
created their own PR machine.

128
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,083
And with your help,
we will win this fight!

129
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,541
As both sides began
to attack each other,

130
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:29,208
it drew the attention of
the public, who then took to

131
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:31,333
the streets to
protest for each cause.

132
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:32,750
Down with the Academy!

133
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:35,166
We support you, Tomoki!

134
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,958
Yeah!

135
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:41,750
The Joint Cultural Fair's music
contest split Sorami City into

136
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:45,583
two warring factions, leaving
it hanging on the edge of chaos.

137
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:48,541
Life was put on hold,
while everybody focused on

138
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:50,208
their respective teams.

139
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:51,958
Is it just me, or is
this whole thing getting

140
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:53,333
completely out of hand?

141
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:56,250
Yeah, I guess we better
start practicing, huh?

142
00:08:56,958 --> 00:09:01,208
Ikaros! Do it again! You're
gonna have to do this live soon.

143
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:02,791
You need more practice!

144
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,333
I'm sorry, Master.
I'll work harder at it.

145
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,708
Hey, Ikaros.

146
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:16,458
Yes, Sohara?

147
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:18,375
Something wrong?
You seem blue.

148
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:22,375
No matter what I try, I can't
be of any help to Master.

149
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:25,458
I wouldn't worry about that,
seriously. I'm on drums and

150
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:27,375
I barely know what I'm doing.

151
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:28,916
I know, but...

152
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,333
That was perfect,
Nymph! Absolutely perfect!

153
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:32,666
It wasn't even that hard.

154
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:35,083
Okay guys, let's
go again. From the top.

155
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:39,208
Here's an idea, Ikaros!
Perhaps the tambourine

156
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:40,750
isn't the best option for you.

157
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:42,166
No?

158
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,750
Maybe there's something
better you can do in the band.

159
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,291
Wanna give it a try?

160
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:47,541
All right.

161
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:56,375
Whoa! How did--? Whoa!

162
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:06,541
Come one, come all!

163
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:08,875
Now that the fair's
here I need to have some fun.

164
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:11,583
There's still a little
time before the performance.

165
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:20,000
Welcome, Master. How
many in your party today?

166
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:22,708
Ikaros! What the holy
Hell are you doing here?

167
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:26,000
Someone in our class said they
needed my help, so I'm helping.

168
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,166
Tomo, what a
nice surprise, welcome!

169
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,375
Sohara!

170
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:31,583
Come on, buddy. Are
you gonna order or what?

171
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:34,000
I'll just... have a juice.

172
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:34,875
And how 'bout you?

173
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:36,166
Just a coffee.

174
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:41,625
She's amazing!

175
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:43,208
Oh, gosh!

176
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:45,166
Tomo, can you stick
around a little longer?

177
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,500
'Cause I'm
about to go on break.

178
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:49,000
We should take a
walk or something... 'kay?

179
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:51,291
Uhh... Yeah, sure thing.

180
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:53,500
So... what're you havin'?

181
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:54,875
A little more please.

182
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:56,000
Huh?

183
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:57,458
Bend over a tad more.

184
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:01,041
You never quit,
do you, pervert?!

185
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:05,000
I'm so excited for today!

186
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:07,166
Where do you guys
think we should start?

187
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:12,083
Tomoki, check it out!

188
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:13,208
What?

189
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:14,750
There's a haunted
house! We should go!

190
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:18,041
Hey, wait!

191
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:25,250
What are you up to?

192
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:29,500
Just my exhibit. I thought I'd
take advantage of the crowds by

193
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:31,833
promoting the New World
Discovery Club and,

194
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:34,041
of course,
the upcoming concert.

195
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:35,000
I see.

196
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:40,625
You wanna go up in the
sky that much? You know...

197
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:43,583
it's not always rainbows
and sunshine up there.

198
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:47,750
I can imagine. It's written all
over yours and Ikaros' faces.

199
00:11:57,583 --> 00:12:00,208
I'm bored. Entertain me.

200
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:03,541
Would it please you
if I sang a song, Master?

201
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:05,208
Or I have an
even better idea!

202
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,041
I could kill all
the bugs for you!

203
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:09,583
That would not please
me, you worthless bitch.

204
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:11,000
Perhaps I
should be rid of you.

205
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:13,125
No, wait! Don't
do that, please!

206
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:15,916
I'll do anything
you ask! Anything!

207
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:19,500
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but you had a little bird, yes?

208
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:22,208
Yes, I do! Would you
like to see it, Master?

209
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:27,958
I found her one day after
she flew right into the Synapse

210
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:29,791
all by herself with
her gorgeous feathers

211
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,125
and adorable little wings.

212
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,083
She's really taken to me!
I think we'll be best...

213
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:35,125
Rip them off!

214
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:37,416
Are you refusing
to obey a direct order

215
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,125
from your own Master?

216
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:42,500
No... It's just...

217
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:58,125
Now that was amusing! I
suppose I shall keep you alive

218
00:12:58,208 --> 00:12:59,916
for a while longer.

219
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,375
Thank you. Thank you Master.
You always know what's right.

220
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:07,333
I'm... so happy...
I could make you laugh.

221
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:12,125
Hey, Nymph!

222
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:16,625
We got this for ya.

223
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:17,958
You did?

224
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:19,916
I promised I'd get
you something, remember?

225
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,250
I said if my booth
turned a profit,

226
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:23,375
I'd buy you anything you
liked, and you like these.

227
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:25,541
Oh... That's right.

228
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:28,166
I saw... you had your
eye on these earlier...

229
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,291
Plus you've been
kickin' ass in the band,

230
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:32,291
so I wanted to
give you something.

231
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:33,708
Thanks for being awesome.

232
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:42,125
Thanks? Is that what
I'm supposed to say? Or...

233
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:51,708
Thank you, Master.
Thank you so much.

234
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:56,208
Humans are no more than
bugs. Simple creatures who we

235
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:59,208
crush underfoot.
Even if he is nice to me,

236
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:01,375
he's still beneath me.

237
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:08,041
It's so good.

238
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:09,125
Isn't it?

239
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:17,041
Way to go, Tomo!
You made her cry!

240
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:20,500
You little devil. So wicked.

241
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:22,083
No, I...!

242
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:28,208
What... are you doing?

243
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:32,916
Look, Nymph. The
sky here is so vast.

244
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,500
What does that even
mean? I don't get it.

245
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,833
What the heck, Tomo? Did you do
something to upset Nymph again?

246
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:39,833
Don't look at me,
I didn't do anything!

247
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:44,166
Why are you all looking
at me, it wasn't my fault!

248
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,958
This candy apple is awful!

249
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:47,875
What are you talking about?
You just said it was good!

250
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:49,166
Oh, shut up!

251
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:52,375
Now now, everyone,
if you could just calm down.

252
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,583
After all, it's almost time.

253
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:07,208
Academy! Academy!

254
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:09,000
Tomoki, you can do it!

255
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:10,958
Give 'em Hell, Tomo!

256
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:12,125
Mikako!

257
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:15,291
Play well, Mikako!
Your band is superior!

258
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:18,208
The Joint Cultural Fair's
music contest will now begin

259
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:20,458
on the main stage.
Please make your way to

260
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:22,541
your seats if
you haven't already.

261
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:28,833
We now give you the full
orchestra from Sorahmi Academy.

262
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:30,958
Please, give them
a round of applause.

263
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:59,041
If they don't realize
how poor and underprivileged

264
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,541
they are after this,
they never will.

265
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:04,916
This... is what true
culture is all about.

266
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:22,291
Man that was really good. I
dunno how we're gonna top that.

267
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:24,708
Oh man. You know
what this means.

268
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:27,125
The Academy's going
to make fun of us again.

269
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:30,916
Hey, don't count us out yet!
We have Tomoki's band this year.

270
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,125
They're bound to be good!

271
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:34,666
I bet Tomoki's gonna
hit a home run for us.

272
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,916
Our next act is a
performance by the members of

273
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,375
the New World Discovery Club!

274
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:42,416
Tomoki! Tomoki! Tomoki!

275
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:46,250
Thank you, thank you very
much. I can hear the voices.

276
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:49,750
They're calling me! The
stage is my life and now

277
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:54,291
the time has come to
show you all... how to rock!

278
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:59,541
This song... is called...
My Tingly Nips!

279
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:11,791
♪I perk up whenever you're
near. And it feels so good.♪

280
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:20,083
♪You perk up when you see me,
too. Like I knew you would.♪

281
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:24,291
♪Is it something that God
gave us as part of his plan?♪

282
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:29,083
♪I know it's hard, but
don't be afraid anymore.♪

283
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:35,458
♪Baby touch my tingly nips
with your gentle hands.♪

284
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:37,916
Tomoki... You
know damn well that's

285
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,583
not the song we decided on.

286
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:42,708
I know, I know! But
it was totally worth it!

287
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:49,041
Wow, that was an easy win.
Thanks so much for the comedy...

288
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:50,583
ingrates.

289
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:53,125
How fitting for these feeble
peasants to play a novelty song.

290
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:55,916
Unfortunately for them
it has led to our victory.

291
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,166
Now that they've seen what
happens, perhaps they should

292
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,916
shut up like the good
future laborers they ar--.

293
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Sorry 'bout that.

294
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:05,625
That was a little bonus...
for the fans. I love you guys!

295
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:06,708
What's this?

296
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:08,416
Can you believe
the nerve of this guy?!

297
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:18,375
Now it's time
for the real song.

298
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:21,625
Here'ya go.

299
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,791
This one's called...
"I'm Falling Down."

300
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:44,625
♪Falling down. Aaahhhh ahhh.♪

301
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:48,333
♪Blue. The sky up above.♪

302
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:51,375

00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:52,750

Long live rock!

320
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:31,500
Did you see the looks on the
faces of those Academy dicks?

321
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:33,833
Yeah. It felt so
good to see them squirm.

322
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:36,208
We couldn't have done
it without you, Ikaros.

323
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:38,958
I am uncertain of
that. But I could not have

324
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:42,333
done it without you.
All of you, helping me.

325
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:45,125
Well, you were great.
Sugata, so were you, dude.

326
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:47,750
And you, Nymph... and, of
course, Sohara and the Prez.

327
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:49,583
I gotta thank all of you guys.

328
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:52,250
But mostly thank me 'cause if
I hadn't of done that other song

329
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:54,041
the real song wouldn't
have sounded so good.

330
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:55,708
Yeah, I don't think so!

331
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,583
Tomoki, I wanted to
ask... are you planning to

332
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:01,166
attend the bonfire tonight?

333
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,666
Bonfire?

334
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:05,541
Yeah. It's really lame actually.
You have to go as a couple

335
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:07,375
and hold each other's
hands the whole time.

336
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:09,041
But since I'm
single and all, I--

337
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:09,916
I'll go with you.

338
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,041
I'll be your date, Tomo.

339
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:12,250
But I...

340
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:18,916
I can't believe
I'm saying this

341
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,833
but you've
become quite the stud.

342
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:22,250
I'm a what-now?

343
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:26,500
Hey... Tomo...

344
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:29,041
Why don't you take
Alpha to the bonfire?

345
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:30,583
How come?

346
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:33,333
Why do you think? She tried
harder than all of us combined.

347
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:37,333
Totally. You should take her out
for a nice evening as a reward.

348
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:39,208
Doesn't that sound like fun?

349
00:23:35,708 --> 00:23:39,416
Is it... wrong for
me to be... this happy?

350
00:23:45,708 --> 00:23:47,666
Are you all right, Ikaros?

351
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:48,666
Yes.

352
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:50,291
Heh, you're crazy.

353
00:23:52,791 --> 00:23:58,625
The very weapon... Master
despises so much... Is me.

354
00:24:03,583 --> 00:24:07,416
Next time... "Off We Go
To My Bathhouse Paradise."
