1
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,500
Ever since I was little... I've
been having this same dream.

2
00:00:36,916 --> 00:00:41,916
In it, I see this girl.
She's someone I've never met.

3
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:44,375
But, I'm in love with her.

4
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:48,166
The kind of deep love you
can only feel after a lifetime.

5
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:50,500
And she loves me
back, just as much.

6
00:00:52,875 --> 00:00:57,458
But... In the end,
something freaky happens...

7
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:05,416
The sky takes her back
somehow... and I wake up from

8
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:09,666
the dream...
unnerved and restless.

9
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:16,416
Hello, everyone... Well...

10
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,041
I am Eishirou Sugata,
resident genius.

11
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:21,750
This here is my
assistant, Pretty.

12
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,625
Look here. There appears
to be some type of

13
00:01:26,708 --> 00:01:28,541
anomalous hole
orbiting the earth.

14
00:01:28,625 --> 00:01:30,583
Scientists around the world
have been working together

15
00:01:30,666 --> 00:01:32,875
to try and solve
the mystery of its origin.

16
00:01:33,875 --> 00:01:36,250
They've even dropped monitoring
devices into the anomaly,

17
00:01:36,333 --> 00:01:38,875
but haven't settled
on any logical conclusion...

18
00:01:38,958 --> 00:01:40,708
But you see, their
hypotheses are flawed,

19
00:01:40,791 --> 00:01:42,916
because they are
grounded in reality.

20
00:01:43,416 --> 00:01:44,916
As I'm sure you're
aware, Columbus,

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,208
who discovered the Americas,
was able to stand an egg

22
00:01:47,291 --> 00:01:50,041
on its end by simply
thinking outside of the box.

23
00:01:50,916 --> 00:01:53,333
This story illustrates that
no one believes in the unreal

24
00:01:53,416 --> 00:01:55,125
until they see
it for themselves.

25
00:01:55,208 --> 00:01:56,750
It's the nature of people.

26
00:01:57,458 --> 00:02:00,458
It's similar to the world
beneath a girl's skirt.

27
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:05,583
Something truly a mystery.
But I have the ability to see!

28
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:08,666
I can see the keywords
that connect everything...

29
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,875
"A Whole New World."

30
00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:14,875
Now, the next issue is what
makes up this "Whole New World?"

31
00:02:14,958 --> 00:02:16,416
Speaking metaphorically,
you could say that

32
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,041
under the girl's skirt.

33
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:26,333
Tomo, come on!
Would you get up already?!

34
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:28,125
We're gonna
be late for school!

35
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:29,750
Just five more minutes.

36
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:33,458
Argh... For crying
out loud, get up!

37
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:37,958
Sohara?! What's wrong?!

38
00:02:42,916 --> 00:02:45,083
You know I hear that's a
good sign. When the flag's

39
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:47,708
full mast first thing
in the morning. Come on.

40
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:53,833
Nooo!

41
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,541
At least drink some
milk before we head out.

42
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:07,125
Oh, yeah, thanks.

43
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:09,250
And your tie's all messed up.

44
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:13,250
It doesn't matter how old you
get, you still act like a child.

45
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,791
Alright, let's get going.

46
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:22,541
We live in Sorami City. It's a
small town with a population of

47
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:24,916
about seven thousand,
completely surrounded

48
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,166
by mountains. It's nice.

49
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,833
The town isn't known
for anything in particular...

50
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:34,125
If it was, it would be the
smile on the old farmer's face.

51
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:36,916
Or maybe, the humongous,
four hundred year old cherry

52
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,916
blossom tree that sits on that
hill right outside of town.

53
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,500
Reinforcing this
sense of isolation...

54
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:44,000
Everyone always complains about
how there's nothing to do here,

55
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:48,166
but I like it. It's my kind
of place. My motto is this:

56
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,333
Stay awake!

57
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:51,291
Peace and quiet is
the only way to live.

58
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:54,833
I like to watch TV, eat,
take a nap during class...

59
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:57,250
The most perfect thing you
can ask for is just a thread of

60
00:03:57,333 --> 00:04:00,666
peace and quiet running through
your life. Wouldn't you agree?

61
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:03,333
Save me.

62
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:04,333
Huh?

63
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:06,833
The sky has me in its grip.

64
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:11,750
The sky has me in its grip.

65
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:16,083
Tomo? Wake up! Tomoki!

66
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:18,666
Class is over if
you hadn't noticed.

67
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:25,791
You had the dream
again, didn't you?

68
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:28,125
Oh, great. Am I crying?

69
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:31,583
Look, Tomoki. You've
been having that dream

70
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:34,000
ever since you were a little
kid. Think maybe you should

71
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:35,750
see a doctor about
it or something?

72
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:37,416
It's just some stupid
dream, it's not like

73
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,208
it's ruining my
life or anything!

74
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:41,541
Okay. Wait, I have an idea.

75
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:44,458
What if we run it by
Sugata? See what he thinks?

76
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:46,833
No freakin' way! I don't
wanna get wrapped up with

77
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:48,750
some dude who just looks
like he attracts trouble.

78
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:49,916
Hey! Everyone come quick!

79
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,583
Some moron's about
to jump off the roof!

80
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:52,875
Huh?!

81
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:54,375
Jump off the roof?

82
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:57,833
The wind is good today.
Although I'm not exactly happy

83
00:04:57,916 --> 00:05:00,083
with the direction
it's blowing.

84
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:01,833
But it won't be a
problem for takeoff!

85
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:04,291
Don't do it! You're
insane! You'll die!

86
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,166
Oh! Hello there, Miss
President. Good morning.

87
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,458
Um, is someone
gonna jump off the roof?

88
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:10,916
Take a look.

89
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,250
Wha--?! Sugata?!

90
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:14,166
Shouldn't you be
trying to stop him?

91
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,666
I could ask him to come
down, but he won't listen.

92
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,250
I'll worry about
it after he falls.

93
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:19,958
Could you be
more irresponsible?

94
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:21,500
I mean, you're
student council president,

95
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:23,000
you gotta do something!

96
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:24,833
If you're talking about
insurance, I already bought

97
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:26,208
a whole lot of it.

98
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:28,750
Several million worth of
life insurance to be exact.

99
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:30,291
Wow, that's a lot.

100
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:32,333
Don't you stand there actin'
all impressed! Come on, Prez.

101
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:34,291
Aren't you two, like,
childhood friends or something?

102
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,625
Shouldn't you show the
tiniest bit of consideration?

103
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:38,083
Are you suggesting
I'm not worried

104
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:39,500
about him in the slightest?

105
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:41,083
No, that's not... uh...

106
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:43,375
Are you suggesting I believe
it might not be such a bad thing

107
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:46,541
to watch my dear friend plummet
to his death with a big smile

108
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:48,625
spread across my face
as the cherry blossoms

109
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:49,916
bloom in the background?

110
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,375
I didn't say that.

111
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:53,083
And are you suggesting I'm
even considering the remote

112
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:55,750
possibility that after I've
made my claim on the insurance,

113
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:58,291
I'll travel the world on
the finest luxury cruise liner

114
00:05:58,375 --> 00:05:59,958
while I mourn my
friend's untimely passing?

115
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:01,625
Um, are you?

116
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:04,166
What do you think? Are you
sure you want that answer?

117
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,375
Uh, no.

118
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:11,583
He jumped.

119
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:12,958
Be careful!

120
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:25,125
So... You wanna head back?

121
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:27,041
Hang on Tomo,
what about your dream?

122
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:28,916
I am so not
talking to that guy!

123
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,458
What are you talking about?

124
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:32,750
Tomo's just being stupid.
He wants to ask Sugata

125
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:35,250
some questions. We
heard he's in the know

126
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:37,541
regarding "out there"
kinds of things.

127
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:40,750
You'd be right about that. He's
creepy, perverted beyond belief,

128
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,625
weird beyond comprehension,
and without a doubt,

129
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:44,416
the freakiest four-eyed
guy I know of.

130
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,583
But he's dependable
for what you need.

131
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:47,750
Dependably nuts!

132
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:49,125
Well, who the Hell
else are we gonna ask?

133
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,000
I mean, you refuse to
go see a professional...

134
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:53,208
I just wanna live
in peace and quiet!

135
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:57,125
Fine then. Have it
your way... Jackass.

136
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:05,000
I understand every
word of your concerns.

137
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:07,541
Many intelligent people
believe dreams to be

138
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:09,458
electrical signals your brain
sends out when

139
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:12,416
processing memories. In
other words, your desires or

140
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,000
your memories become your
dreams during your sleep.

141
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:16,583
O-kay...

142
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:19,375
But that's nothing more than a
hypothesis grounded in reality.

143
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:22,333
And you can't explain
the unreal using real terms.

144
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:24,416
Look at this.

145
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:27,375
No, not that!

146
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:30,708
You know what that is?

147
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:32,083
The black spot? No.

148
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:33,041
Of course you don't.

149
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:34,375
What?

150
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:36,250
Because you've already
concluded you don't know.

151
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:38,416
There are scientists who have
spent years researching this

152
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,750
and have yet to figure out
the slightest thing about it.

153
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:43,833
But I understand it. I know
exactly what the true nature is

154
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:46,333
behind this hole...
and of course...

155
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:48,250
I also know what
your dream means.

156
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:51,541
Both of them are part
of A Whole New World!

157
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:53,791
Such fools in the
scientific community!

158
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:56,750
Something with this much
mass, this much displacement!

159
00:07:56,833 --> 00:08:00,291
It can't be anything but a whole
new world floating up there!

160
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:05,000
This recurring dream you've
been having is also connected to

161
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:07,416
this whole new world.
Have faith in me and I will

162
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,458
unlock the mystery
of this dream of yours!

163
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:10,791
That's great.

164
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:12,375
Sohara...

165
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:13,458
At precisely midnight tonight,
this Whole New World of which

166
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:15,333
I speak will
fly over this town.

167
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:17,083
Do you mind if
I come check it out?

168
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:18,833
Sounds just fine.

169
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:22,333
This is bad. I can
already hear it. The sound of

170
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:25,666
my beautiful peace and quiet
being torn apart at the seams!

171
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,250
We'll meet at the old
cherry blossom tree next to

172
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:29,708
the shrine at midnight. We're
going to see this together.

173
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:37,541
I'm sorry. But my mother
told me I can't stay out

174
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:39,375
past midnight tonight.

175
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:41,750
Apologies, Mikako
needs me tonight...

176
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:44,125
It doesn't look like
I'll be able to join you.

177
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:48,041
To everyone who said they'd
come up here with me, tonight,

178
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:50,541
thanks a lot. I'm looking
around and guess what?

179
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:52,750
No one. Sincerely, Tomoki.

180
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:57,916
To Hell with this!
I'm outta here!

181
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,500
Oh, it's Sugata.

182
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,833
'Ey, what's up, weirdo?

183
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:05,041
Get the Hell outta there!

184
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:08,333
I just did another pass
over the most recent data

185
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:10,708
and something odd is going on.
I'm heading over there now.

186
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:12,750
What? You're breaking
up. I can't hear.

187
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:14,458
The hole is moving...

188
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:15,416
What?

189
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,750
You're in danger...

190
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:27,708
What the--?!

191
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:33,750
Oh, no... It's a person!

192
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:39,083
No. It's not a person.
A person doesn't have...

193
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:42,291
A person doesn't... have wings!

194
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:48,375
Don't think about
how weird this is.

195
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:50,583
The whole mess
just stinks of trouble.

196
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:52,541
Run away!

197
00:09:57,875 --> 00:10:00,208
What the Hell is happening?!

198
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:04,416
She'll be
fine. I'm sure of it.

199
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,750
The chick fell
outta the freakin' sky

200
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:07,291
without a scratch on her.

201
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:10,916
I'm not getting
involved. No way.

202
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,416
"Peace and quiet is the best."

203
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,083
That's my motto
and I'm sticking to it.

204
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:18,916
That's it. That's what I say.
Those are the words I live by.

205
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,541
Ah! Damn it!

206
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:39,000
Ah, man! All I want,
is to live in peace!

207
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:43,291
After this I'm gonna go home,
watch TV, and pass the Hell out.

208
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:08,583
Begin imprinting process.

209
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:29,583
It is a pleasure to meet you.
I am a Pet-Class Angeloid.

210
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:34,708
My purpose is to fulfill
your every want and desire.

211
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:37,083
You are my master.

212
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:52,833
Hey, Tomo! I'm
on cleaning duty today,

213
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:54,833
so I'm gonna
head off to school!

214
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:57,750
Get your ass out of
bed so you're not late.

215
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:03,000
Good morning... Master.

216
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:11,666
Oh right, I forgot
about the winged chick who

217
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,875
fell from the sky yesterday.

218
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:17,458
Master, please make a command.

219
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:22,166
Give me any order that will
please you. Anything you desire.

220
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,625
Angeloids were created
for the sole purpose of

221
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:28,083
bringing our masters
pleasure. It is all we know.

222
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:31,625
So whatever I want, eh?

223
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:33,833
Yes.

224
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:34,833
Your...

225
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:36,916
My what?

226
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,458
Well, how about
a bunch of cash?

227
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:41,916
You are requesting
a sum of money?

228
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,208
That was almost weird. I was
about to get my freak on with

229
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:46,666
an alien creature
from space or wherever.

230
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,375
What's wrong with my head?

231
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:51,000
Yeah, duh. If I had
that much money I could buy

232
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:53,041
anything I wanted
in the whole world.

233
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:55,291
Initiating transport.

234
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:14,541
You're screwing with my head!
What is that card thingy?

235
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:16,166
Lemme see it! Hand it over!

236
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:19,375
In your language,
this card would be known as

237
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:21,125
a teleportation device.

238
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:22,500
Teleportation?

239
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:24,791
I hear your request,
and all I need to do is

240
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:27,500
order the required
materials from the Synapse.

241
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:28,875
What's the Synapse?

242
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:31,791
I have no stored information
regarding the Synapse.

243
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:36,083
Those databanks are clear. After
all, I have only just awoken,

244
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:38,083
so I am void of much data.

245
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:43,958
I am a Pet-Class Angeloid.
My type is Alpha. Ikaros.

246
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:47,208
I was manufactured by
the Synapse... for you.

247
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:49,458
For your sole pleasure.

248
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,958
I don't care about all
that noise. Too confusing.

249
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:58,125
What I wanna know
is what else can you do?

250
00:13:58,208 --> 00:13:59,458
Anything.

251
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:01,500
Anything?!

252
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:02,708
Correct.

253
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:10,416
Come on! Aw...
These stupid things have

254
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,500
grown again haven't they?

255
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:14,750
There's no point
in them being this big.

256
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:16,875
Oh, yeah! Being
invisible kicks ass!

257
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:18,958
Master, why are we here?

258
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:21,666
Living a man's dream, Ikaros.
That's what we're doing.

259
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:24,916
Something about men, everything
comes down to our libidos.

260
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,125
Oh, and food.

261
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:29,791
Now, let's mess with her some.

262
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:41,375
That was awesome! I can't
believe I actually got her!

263
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:43,333
Master... Please explain.

264
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:45,291
That, my good
Ikaros, was punishment.

265
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:46,958
Punishment for the
vicious girl who's always

266
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:49,500
karate-chopping me
with her stupid hands!

267
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:50,916
It was punishment?

268
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,333
Okay, Ikaros,
time for the next one!

269
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:54,791
Transport!

270
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:59,833
Time... stop!

271
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:09,750
Master?

272
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:12,666
Yes! Everywhere
I wanna go is mine!

273
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,041
The world is
mine for the taking!

274
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:17,875
Let's keep moving!

275
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:33,291
I know. But that's what I
told the loser. Yeah, right?

276
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:39,958
I am King of the World!
Your panties are mine!

277
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:49,875
How is your dinner, Master?

278
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:56,208
It's lightin' up my tastebuds.
But what is this stuff, anyway?

279
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:57,875
I've never had it before.

280
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:00,041
The card summoned a
quantum food changer which

281
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,875
transformed the air
in such a way as to--

282
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:04,375
Forget about it.
That crap's way over my head.

283
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,500
Do you have any
further commands, Master?

284
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:11,583
Not right now. Uh...

285
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:15,958
'Cept maybe... you stripping?

286
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:17,083
All right.

287
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:24,000
No, no! Reel that in,
seriously! I was just kidding!

288
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,166
It was a joke!
Cancel that order!

289
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:30,458
I cannot cancel
orders. I was not given

290
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:32,541
capacity for that function.

291
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:37,916
Do you have any
further orders for me?

292
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,125
No! No! Nothing I can think
of! In fact, I'm exhausted!

293
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,916
We're done for today! We can
just pick up the whole thing

294
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,916
where we left off
tomorrow! Whattya say?

295
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,625
That said... I'm
happy I've gotten to do

296
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:48,500
everything I wanted to.
I guess the only thing left

297
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:50,791
on my list is to
take over the world!

298
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:59,416
Tomo, time to wake up!

299
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,500
Why weren't you at
school yesterday, dumbass?

300
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:04,958
The teacher was pissed! You're
in so much trouble today!

301
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:08,625
Open up the freakin' door.

302
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:10,250
I heard you. Ease up.

303
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:16,500
What do you... want? Hey,
uh... Sohara? What the heck?

304
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:21,208
World Domination will be
complete momentarily, Master.

305
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:22,625
Wha-huh?

306
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,583
I activated a World Domination
Program while you slept.

307
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,083
Don't tell me...

308
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:34,333
According to my research, not
a single human on Planet Earth

309
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:37,125
would recognize you
as their supreme ruler.

310
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:41,083
It therefore seems the program
determined the best course of

311
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:43,083
action was to
erase all other humans

312
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:44,875
on the planet from existence.

313
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:48,208
Wait... every other human
being... on the planet?

314
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:49,333
Correct.

315
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:53,791
Can you cancel that?

316
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:57,875
I cannot. I was not given
capacity for that function.

317
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:09,458
I can't believe this.
I only wanted a normal life.

318
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:14,458
A peaceful one. And look at
what I get. The exact opposite.

319
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:28,791
Is there really no one
left on the entire planet?

320
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:31,333
I apologize, Master.
I interpreted your

321
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:33,041
statement as an order.

322
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:38,500
What do you wish now?
Would it remedy the situation

323
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:40,375
if I destroy myself?

324
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:43,958
Yeah, I guess that'd
make things a little better.

325
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:49,708
I've had enough of this BS.

326
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,041
Yes, Master.

327
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:05,000
Master?

328
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:08,375
I was just kidding.
It's just a joke, you know?

329
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:10,625
Go ahead and cancel
that last order, okay?

330
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:13,125
I cannot cancel an order.

331
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:17,125
Why the hell not?! You haven't
done a single thing wrong!

332
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:20,291
You've just been following every
stupid order I've spit out.

333
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:22,875
Come on, there's no
reason for you to die!

334
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:24,833
I was not given
capacity for that function.

335
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:26,958
I'm begging you!
You have to help me.

336
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:28,750
Everyone left because of me.

337
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:31,375
I don't know what
I'm supposed to do.

338
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:33,750
Don't leave me here all alone.

339
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:38,291
I'm on my knees.
Cancel that order.

340
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:41,666
Stay... Stay with me, please!

341
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,875
I will, Master.

342
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:57,916
I wish this whole mess was
nothing but one bad nightmare.

343
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:04,208
Keep your angel. Treasure her.

344
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:05,250
Huh?

345
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:08,500
And never part
with her. Not ever.

346
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:16,041
Hey, Tomo! I'm on cleaning
duty today, so I'm gonna

347
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:19,208
head off to school! Get your ass
out of bed so you're not late.

348
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:21,541
Was that some kinda
tripped out dream or what?

349
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:24,583
I feel all dizzy.
Whoa, man. I can't even tell

350
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:28,041
which way is up.
What's my problem?

351
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:30,750
Are you well
this morning, Master?

352
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:32,250
You!

353
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:34,375
You wished everything was
nothing more than a nightmare

354
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:37,500
so I activated a program
that made it all into a dream

355
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:39,375
and returned
the world to normal.

356
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:41,625
You can actually do that?

357
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:43,333
Did I do bad?

358
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:46,916
Hell no! You did a great
thing! You're the best ever!

359
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:53,041
But to be honest... I'm
more tired than I've ever been.

360
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:56,666
Pardon me, Master.
Is this something you want

361
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:59,666
to stay as part
of your dream as well?

362
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:00,833
Huh? Is what something?

363
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:03,000
You told me stay
with you, then you said

364
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:05,583
you wanted
everything to change back.

365
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:08,500
Would it be better...
if I remained a part of

366
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:10,500
your dream state?

367
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:18,125
I think you should do
whatever you want, Ikaros.

368
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:21,500
Master? I do not understand.

369
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:23,916
Do I have to
explain everything?!

370
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:35,333
No, Master.

371
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:41,333
I say this all the time, but the
only thing I want in this world

372
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:44,833
is to live a normal, peaceful
life. 'Cept there's this chick

373
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:48,125
with a vicious karate chop
who's always out to get me.

374
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:51,166
And some freakboy who thinks
he can fly, stressing me out.

375
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:54,625
And last, but certainly
not least, I got Ikaros.

376
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:56,791
The girl who
fell from the sky.

377
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:03,458
And that's how
this whole thing began.

378
00:22:03,541 --> 00:22:06,708
These are days I don't
think I'll ever forget.

379
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:49,208
Y-You don't have to stand
so close to me, you know.

380
00:23:49,291 --> 00:23:51,000
Jeez! Close the door!

381
00:24:04,208 --> 00:24:08,000
Next time... "An Airborne,
Prismatic, Panty Adventure."
