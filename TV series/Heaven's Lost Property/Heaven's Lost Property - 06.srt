1
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:33,375
Most importantly, perhaps,
it's also in our home.

2
00:00:33,458 --> 00:00:35,291
When I woke up this morning...

3
00:00:36,958 --> 00:00:38,875
I found myself
smack in the middle of

4
00:00:38,958 --> 00:00:41,625
another weird ass situation.

5
00:00:51,958 --> 00:00:54,875
Oh, for crying out
loud! Another one?!

6
00:00:54,958 --> 00:00:57,583
These freaky creature-things
are coming out of the woodwork!

7
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:40,166
Good morning, everybody. Looks
like it's gonna be another

8
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,166
hot one in Fukuoka today.

9
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,750
We're gonna have to break
out the parasols, fans,

10
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:47,500
water bottles,
hey, whatever you got.

11
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:48,916
Hey, Ikaros.

12
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,166
Yes, Master?

13
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,125
Who the hell is that?!
Is she from your world?

14
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:53,666
She's got wings like you!

15
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm not sure.

16
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:57,125
Well, she certainly
looks like you, I mean...

17
00:02:57,208 --> 00:02:59,833
Not just the wings, the collar,
the weird ear thingies!

18
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:01,791
You do not get to make
my home into your new

19
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:04,333
Clubhouse for Freaky Angel
Girls! Is this sinking in?!

20
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:06,833
Um... Hey, Mr. Little Bug.

21
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:16,333
I hope I didn't hear
what I thought I just heard.

22
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:19,291
I'm sorry, what was
that you called me there?

23
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:21,083
I called you Mr. Little Bug...

24
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:23,416
Who else in the room would
I be calling, "Mister?"

25
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,791
Right, thanks.

26
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:30,041
Ikaros, you know my motto,
"peace and quiet is the

27
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:32,750
only way to live?" I'm
having a hell of a time

28
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:34,666
maintaining that
with just you here.

29
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,125
See what I'm getting at?

30
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:37,375
Yes, Master.

31
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,500
Then move your ass and
get this chick outta here!

32
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:44,500
Enough's enough already! Lemme
get back to my peace and quiet!

33
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:47,916
Everyone always seems to have
such a good time at Tomoki's.

34
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:49,958
Who's in there?

35
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:55,666
Why'd we have to
bring her along again?!

36
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,041
Who cares? The
more the merrier.

37
00:03:58,125 --> 00:04:00,541
At least that's always
been my philosophy.

38
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:02,583
I don't think that's
true in this case!

39
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:05,000
Originally, Tomo and I were
supposed to go to the beach

40
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:08,333
by ourselves today. See
how well that worked out.

41
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,500
Yes, a winner! Top prize is a
day trip for two to the beach!

42
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:19,125
You kids have a great time!

43
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:20,333
Yeah!

44
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:23,125
Here you go. Congratulations.

45
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:25,958
I did it. I won. You realize
the two of us haven't been on

46
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:27,916
a trip together
since we were kids?

47
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,125
You played enough, you
were bound to win something.

48
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:33,416
Oh, I cannot wait! And
I'm so happy the rest of

49
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,041
the gang won't be joining.

50
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:38,083
Congratulations.
I'm so excited for you.

51
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:40,208
You've both won a day
trip for two to the beach.

52
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:43,458
I can't believe it.
What a great day, really.

53
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:50,041
Sorry, Sohara.

54
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:52,333
Why? What are you sorry for?

55
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:54,250
Because... I know that
you were supposed to be

56
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:56,291
going on this trip,
just you and Tomoki.

57
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:59,958
No. Forget it. I'm cool with
the way things turned out.

58
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:02,541
Guess I can't stay
disappointed forever.

59
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:04,416
I mean hey, it's still
a day at the beach.

60
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,958
So, do you have a name,
or do we have to give you one?

61
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,000
It's Nymph.

62
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:11,916
Okay, weird, but
Nymph it is, I suppose.

63
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,375
Oh yeah, I almost forgot...
I made breakfast riceballs

64
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:18,166
for all of us. Here you go.

65
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,791
Take your pick!

66
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:23,750
Oh, this one.

67
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:25,125
Why has another
Angeloid appeared here

68
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:26,416
seemingly out of the blue?

69
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,083
That's what I said.
They're coming out of the

70
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:29,291
freakin woodwork!

71
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:32,166
Wow! Your wings glow
rainbow colors all over!

72
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,583
They're just beautiful!

73
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,958
You seem a lot different
from Ikaros, that's for sure.

74
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:38,708
Of course I seem different.
I'm not an Alpha type.

75
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:40,125
So, what are you?

76
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:42,500
I guess you'd call me
the generation after Alpha.

77
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:44,500
If generation's the right word.

78
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:48,041
With you side-by-side like that,
you could pass for sisters.

79
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:50,166
One of them, two of them.
It's all the same.

80
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,750
Just keep an eye on them.

81
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:55,916
It's not the same at all! I just
want my peace and quiet back!

82
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:00,833
B-Boobies!

83
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:02,750
Boobie time!

84
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:07,625
Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot!

85
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:10,750
Better be careful Tomoki!

86
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:20,083
Hang on...Where did...
you all get those swimsuits?

87
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:22,416
Prez felt bad for the
girls, so she bought 'em.

88
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,500
Ikaros, what happened to your
back? I don't see your wings.

89
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:30,125
Correct. I am able to withdraw
my wings whenever I need to.

90
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:33,708
But they are still here,
this is as small as they get.

91
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:36,458
I can actually make
my wings invisible.

92
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,458
Oh. That sounds pretty useful.

93
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:42,333
I asked them to prop us
up an umbrella over there.

94
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:44,041
What say we all
go enjoy ourselves?

95
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:45,791
This is gonna be awesome!

96
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:48,541
Nymph kinda bugs
the crap outta me.

97
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:51,458
Hey Eve, we're never gonna make
it unless you pick up the pace.

98
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:54,458
Mizuki, you're never gonna
find happiness in Eden.

99
00:06:55,583 --> 00:07:00,250
Aw, screw her, I'm at the beach!
And I am gonna have me some fun!

100
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:02,333
Service!

101
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:04,125
Set!

102
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:06,166
It's just like I dreamed it!

103
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,125
Beach volleyball
is a beautiful sport!

104
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:12,250
The way Sohara's chest heaves
and bounces! Best day ever!

105
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:14,458
Tomoki! Quit starin'
at my chest!

106
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:16,625
Heat must be gettin' to ya,
you're imagining things.

107
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:17,541
Jerk.

108
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,416
Nice spike! Way to go, Nymph!

109
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,458
Nice spike, my ass! Why did
you put so much power behind it!

110
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:28,916
You trying to kill
me or something?

111
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,541
It's your own stupid
fault for zoning out.

112
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:33,625
I'm not responsible.

113
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:36,166
Master. Are you all right?

114
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:38,958
What is her problem?!

115
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:42,083
Okay, beach
volleyball is bullshit!

116
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:44,625
Well then, what do you say we
take a boat out on the water?

117
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:46,458
Yeah, sure. That might be fun.

118
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:51,291
It's crunch time,
ladies and gents!

119
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:52,791
We're comin'
down to the wire!

120
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:53,875
Sugata!

121
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:56,458
Check this out folks!
We've got ourselves...

122
00:07:56,541 --> 00:08:01,000
Come on, Sugata! You
still have a long way to go!

123
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:03,833
Oh, that's not good.

124
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,250
I think we should
just let him do his thing.

125
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:12,916
Yeah... I'm gonna go
find the boat rental place

126
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,250
and grab us one, okay?

127
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:15,458
Yeah.

128
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,083
Hey, Nymph. Hot dog?

129
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,291
And now you say,
"thank you." Go ahead.

130
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:43,000
Give it a try. C'mon. It
won't take too much effort.

131
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:45,041
You're not the boss
of me, Little Bug!

132
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:46,500
Geez, I'm sorry.

133
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:51,208
This is great.

134
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:55,666
You're kinda cute when you
actually smile, you know that?

135
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:57,666
Don't sit next to me!

136
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:58,833
'Kay, chill out!

137
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,666
Hey... I've been
meaning to ask you...

138
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,541
Why did you come here, anyway?

139
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:10,000
Why? No real reason, I guess.
I just wanted to find out

140
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:12,333
for myself what the
lower world was like.

141
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:14,083
Ah. Or maybe it was something
like you were worried about

142
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:16,875
how Ikaros was doing and you
came here to check up on her?

143
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:18,833
You two are friends, right?

144
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:21,458
Yeah, something like that, I
suppose. 'Cause I sure didn't

145
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:23,666
come all the way down here
to make friends with you.

146
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:29,041
Oh, gee thanks. Oh yeah.
Where did Ikaros go, anyway?

147
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,583
She's out there.

148
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:51,708
See? I told you so.

149
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:54,750
What is that lunatic doing
at the bottom of the ocean?!

150
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:09,625
Do you require
assistance, Master?

151
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:12,875
You don't need to worry.
Diving down to that depth

152
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:14,583
is a cinch for
an Alpha like her.

153
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:16,666
It's all part of
their design capabilities.

154
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,291
At least try to float
around like a normal person!

155
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:21,666
I mean, what if someone
saw you down there?!

156
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:25,041
But my wings absorb water,
so no matter what I end up

157
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:28,375
sinking to the bottom.
I can't do anything about it.

158
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:30,041
You're so dumb sometimes.
Have you ever thought about

159
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:31,708
looking at me as an
example and just not

160
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:33,625
getting water on your wings?

161
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:35,958
Well, they are
already wet now...

162
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:40,083
Well, crap. No way I can leave
Ikaros to her own devices.

163
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:41,583
Guess I'll teach her to swim!

164
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:47,000
Tomoki! I rented the boat,
check it out! Hey, Tomoki!

165
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:48,958
No, you're doing it wrong!
Your legs go straight out

166
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:52,000
for the flutter kick! I'll keep
pulling, you keep kicking!

167
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:54,291
I'll try, Master.
Is this right?

168
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:57,541
Sorry, still
wrong! Kick harder!

169
00:10:57,625 --> 00:10:59,916
Tomo, what about us?

170
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:15,208
He can be such a jerk. After
I went through the trouble of

171
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:18,333
renting this stupid boat.
I don't care anymore.

172
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:28,000
But if I could swim...
this'd suck a little less.

173
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:33,000
Hold up. You're serious?
You never learned how to swim?

174
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:34,000
No.

175
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:36,375
Here, then I'll pull
you through the water.

176
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:39,375
It'll be fun. Come on.
Give it a shot.

177
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:46,583
Your legs go straight
out for the flutter kick.

178
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:48,708
Tomoki, I'm scared!

179
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:53,708
You're fine. I gotcha,
and I won't let ya go, 'kay?

180
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:06,250
I wonder if he's
forgotten about that time.

181
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,458
Oh, no! What happened?!
When did I drift out this far?!

182
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:14,291
And great, I let the oar go.

183
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:20,625
I've been carried away.
I gotta get back.

184
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:27,333
Cool... let's take another.

185
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:31,666
It got kinda cloudy
all of a sudden.

186
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:34,083
Hey, has anybody seen Sohara?

187
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:36,125
Now that you mention it,
I saw her hop into a boat

188
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:39,625
by herself not long ago.
Maybe she's paddling around.

189
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:44,416
That's right. I forgot I told
her I'd go boating with her.

190
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:54,708
Hang on. Is that her?

191
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:58,833
Sohara, wait!

192
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:04,583
Sohara!

193
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:20,125
Oh, no!

194
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:27,458
Amazing.

195
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:36,125
You're flying...

196
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:38,291
And you're lame. Can't
do anything on your own.

197
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:45,041
I can't get to the surface.

198
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:54,375
Here, I got you!

199
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:01,583
Are you okay?

200
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:05,791
Tomoki... And Nymph, too?

201
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,875
Thank you both.

202
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:17,625
No, I owe you
an apology, Sohara.

203
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:20,041
I thought if Ikaros caused
a scene it'd end up biting me

204
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:24,000
in the ass, like it always does.
I guess I just focused on that

205
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:28,666
and forgot all about you.
I really am very sorry.

206
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:36,791
No more goin' out on the
water by yourself, understand?

207
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:38,708
It's dangerous for anybody...

208
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:41,958
Let alone someone who
never learned to swim.

209
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:48,333
I can't believe it.
He actually remembered.

210
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:53,791
Right. The drama's over! Let's
get this party swingin' again!

211
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:56,458
Oh, wait. The
sun's going down.

212
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:58,458
I'm sorry, Sohara.

213
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:04,875
Don't worry. It's okay.
Thanks for saving me, Tomoki.

214
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:08,000
Hold on a second, Bug.

215
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:09,583
Huh?

216
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:11,041
Why are you trying to act all
smooth? The only reason you were

217
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:13,416
able to save her was
'cause you had my help.

218
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,166
Duh. I'm not stupid. I know.

219
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,166
And I haven't even
gotten a "thank you" yet.

220
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:23,458
Oh... Sorry. I guess, thanks,
Nymph. You helped me out a lot.

221
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:26,416
Can't say I'm really
feelin' it over here, Bug.

222
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,750
What?!

223
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:29,916
You've got a lot of
nerve for a freakin' insect.

224
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,958
Ikaros! What's the deal
with your loud-mouthed friend?!

225
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:35,041
Why does she
keep calling me a bug?

226
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:38,791
It's about time to start packing
our things up to go home.

227
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:41,208
You know? I
couldn't agree more.

228
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:43,916
Oh, yeah, Ikaros, before
we leave I want you and I to

229
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,250
go over what you've
learned one more time.

230
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:48,500
All right, Master.

231
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:55,125
Like I said, dummy! The
flutter kick's all in the legs!

232
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,833
We're staying.

233
00:15:58,916 --> 00:15:59,750
Huh?

234
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,708
It's not fair to me that you've
only spent time with Ikaros

235
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:06,250
since we've gotten here!
So I don't wanna go home!

236
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:08,250
So we're gonna stay
here and we're gonna do

237
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:09,833
whatever I want
on the beach tomorrow!

238
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:11,833
You're a freakin'
crazy person!

239
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:18,500
A pass for...
a seaside lodge?

240
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:28,625
Your angel... How is she?

241
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:36,000
Oh, right. Yeah... Thing about
that is another one showed up...

242
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:38,666
She's not bad, but whatever...

243
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:41,333
Careful...

244
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:45,458
Be careful...

245
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:51,583
What are you doing here?

246
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:52,333
Yes.

247
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:53,791
"Yes" isn't an answer.

248
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:54,875
No.

249
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,958
You're supposed to be in
Sohara's room, so get back

250
00:16:58,041 --> 00:17:01,291
in there and go to sleep before
you make us both look insane!

251
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:02,833
Pardon, Master.

252
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:04,416
What is it?

253
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:08,083
I was hoping you could explain
to me what it is like to sleep.

254
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:11,500
As Angeloids, we were not
designed with any kind of

255
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:14,333
sleep functions in our
programming. That is why

256
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:18,083
I don't understand what it means
to sleep or to have dreams.

257
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,583
Okay, so what the heck have
you been doing every night

258
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:25,666
while I've been
going to sleep?

259
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:29,416
I simply sat by your
side, waiting for you.

260
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,875
Waiting patiently
for you to wake up.

261
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,958
All right,
guess I'm awake now.

262
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:45,083
You wanna walk
down to the beach?

263
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,000
Master...

264
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:49,541
It must've been cramped keeping
your wings under wraps all day.

265
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:51,708
There shouldn't be anyone
down there this time of night.

266
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:54,708
You can stretch those suckers
out as much as you want.

267
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:56,833
Thank you.

268
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:08,666
Ikaros' specs detail that she
can drop to a maximum depth of

269
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:11,083
three thousand meters and
she can operate continuously,

270
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:13,666
without oxygen, for
seven hundred twenty hours.

271
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:16,958
I'd estimate Nymph has
roughly the same capabilities.

272
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:21,416
What's the purpose of sending
another Angleoid down here now?

273
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:25,333
This is all so strange.

274
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:34,958
I'd think it must be hella
nice not needing sleep.

275
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:39,166
But for some reason...
I don't know why...

276
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,875
I felt bad for
Ikaros when I heard that.

277
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:51,750
I wonder if that other
angel sits up awake all night,

278
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:53,750
unable to sleep, too.

279
00:18:58,625 --> 00:18:59,833
Master?

280
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:01,916
It's about time
for us to head back.

281
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,333
All right.

282
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:07,166
Let go of me,
you stupid little bug!

283
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:10,250
And here we are being the nicest
guys in the world to you, too.

284
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:11,208
Nymph!

285
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,666
Sorry... She has kind of
a big mouth on her sometimes.

286
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:24,500
Come on. Let's go.

287
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:27,416
Hold it. We're not done
talkin' to your friend yet.

288
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,500
We just got concerned
'cause she's so young

289
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:31,666
and she was strolling
around the beach alone.

290
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:34,833
Lemme go! And stay away
from me, you big stinky bug!

291
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:36,333
What'd you say?

292
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:40,541
Hey, maybe your buddy can
explain. How are we bugs? Huh?

293
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:45,291
Just what do you think
you are doing to my master?

294
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:47,333
You got wings?!

295
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,750
Alpha.

296
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:53,541
I asked what you are doing
to him. And I expect you to

297
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:56,291
give me a
satisfactory answer.

298
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:09,750
What is going on?!

299
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,708
Stop it.

300
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:33,041
I said stop!

301
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,875
What the holy Hell was that?!

302
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:47,666
You shouldn't be
doing stuff like that! Ever!

303
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:55,916
We're going.

304
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,208
Two angels...

305
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:26,208
Ikaros, I been wondering...

306
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:27,708
Yes, Master?

307
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:29,875
That watermelon you've been
holding like a newborn baby

308
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:33,000
is probably like... completely
rotten inside by now.

309
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,583
What do you
plan to do with it?

310
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:43,333
Oh man! That just
makes you look even cuter!

311
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:47,916
Sorry I got mad at you last
night. I swear, it's just,

312
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,416
you looked like some
killer android weapon.

313
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,416
Like you'd see in
a movie or something.

314
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:56,916
I guess it caught me off
guard, and I kinda freaked out.

315
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:41,458
I wonder if Ikaros got rusty
from being out in the ocean?

316
00:23:41,958 --> 00:23:44,375
'Cause I keep hearing
this weird sound.

317
00:23:45,875 --> 00:23:47,916
Here, why don't
you try eating this?

318
00:23:53,041 --> 00:23:55,541
Master... Here is your tea.

319
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,166
She seems a
whole lot better now.

320
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:08,000
Next time... The Brainy,
Heart-pounding Transfer Students
