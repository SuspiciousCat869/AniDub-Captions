1
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:35,625
Here you are, Master.

2
00:00:35,708 --> 00:00:37,208
Thanks, Ikaros.

3
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:48,958
I am the weapon Master despises.
I don't know if I should

4
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:51,625
keep that
information from him.

5
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:05,208
I wonder what Master
is thinking right now.

6
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:12,208
I wish I could find some
way into the girl's bath.

7
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:46,916
The fifteenth century was the
dawn of the Age of Exploration.

8
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,958
Joan of Arc followed
a mysterious voice that

9
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:52,208
spoke to her only in her
dream. She dressed as a man

10
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:55,291
and rose up to lead the
French army to many victories.

11
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:58,750
It's been a long time
since then and again,

12
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:00,708
a youth listens to a dream.

13
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:02,958
He's about to
change the world.

14
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:05,166
He will dress up
in women's clothing.

15
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,958
And he will seek
out the New World.

16
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:10,208
Sugata. Looking pretty hot.

17
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:13,416
Oh, Mikako... cut it out.

18
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,750
A bath together?

19
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:21,416
Tomoki said he
wanted us all to go.

20
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,666
'Course I tried arguing,
but he wouldn't hear it.

21
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,375
Come on ladies, sometimes
an open-air bath can be

22
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:28,333
the perfect thing
to relax your senses.

23
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:31,041
Given this is your idea, are
we sure this isn't a case of

24
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:33,375
the smaller head
controlling the larger one?

25
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:36,958
No, not at all. Personal hygeine
is very important at our age.

26
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:38,791
Yeah, I guess they'd
drag him through the streets

27
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:41,041
and beat him senseless.
Not that I wouldn't

28
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:43,000
love every second of it.

29
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:46,916
Here we go. I'll use
one of Ikaros's cards,

30
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,500
and these hotties will
be mine for the taking!

31
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:52,333
Okay, Ikaros, why
don't you hand over all of

32
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:53,541
the cards you have on you?

33
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:54,875
All right.

34
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:57,083
Sorry about that, Tomo,
but I know exactly what's

35
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:58,250
on your devious little mind.

36
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:00,208
Figured I'd cut
you off at the pass.

37
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:03,416
We are gonna take that
bath later, but it'll be

38
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,916
just us girls,
thank you very much.

39
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:07,833
Ciao, buddy.

40
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:10,000
Tomoki, maybe a little
foresight on this one

41
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,041
would have benefited you some.

42
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:13,208
I personally
don't think anything's

43
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:14,750
ever gonna benefit him.

44
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:16,125
He'll always get tripped up
by his own ambitious desires.

45
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:17,916
I only got one chance left.

46
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,583
Not interested.

47
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:22,000
But the girls
are gonna be bathing!

48
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:24,666
Not a stitch of clothing
on any of 'em! Bathing!

49
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:31,083
Don't you get it?
This is the New World.

50
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:35,708
What did you say?
What did you just say?

51
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:38,583
Think about it. Boys can
only enter the women's bath

52
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:41,208
until they're what,
like ten years old?

53
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:43,416
And then we've got no
chance to do it ever again.

54
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,541
Not for the rest of our lives.
We're cut off from that world.

55
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:51,833
And what a wondrous world it
must be! The women's bath! So!

56
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:54,375
Is it not possible the New
World you've been searching for

57
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:57,125
is there, behind
those forbidden walls?

58
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:03,625
Where the heck
did you get that card?

59
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:05,375
When I spoke to her
earlier, I took one of these

60
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:07,375
to examine for myself.

61
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:16,250
A transmogrifier... it
might not operate that stably

62
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:19,625
but it can transform you into
something else nevertheless.

63
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:21,583
Use it to become a girl.

64
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,041
However, you can't
just dive straight into

65
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:25,541
the bath when you do.

66
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,708
To avoid suspicions you have
to completely transform into

67
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:31,875
one of them first. Only then
can you seek out the New World.

68
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:32,791
Understand?

69
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:34,250
Sir, yes, sir!

70
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:36,916
This'll be a very
difficult mission.

71
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,250
One from which
you might not return.

72
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:41,500
A risk I'm more
than willing to take.

73
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:48,458
I'm back!

74
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:55,083
Hi there! I'm Tomoko!

75
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:57,916
So basically, you used
one of our cards so

76
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
you could turn
yourself into a girl?

77
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:01,875
Pretty cool huh? I
thought it might be fun to

78
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:03,916
live life as a girl
for a little while.

79
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,708
Everything appears normal
on her for the time being.

80
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:11,875
I'm a girl now so there's a
few hundred things I wanna try,

81
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:15,000
if you know what I mean.
C'mon, let's get outta here!

82
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:18,375
I guess I'm used to
seeing panties, but now

83
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:19,958
I get to wear 'em,
so I look forward to

84
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:22,791
approaching 'em from
an entirely different way!

85
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:27,208
They put pads in the
bras? I didn't know that.

86
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:29,666
What else are they
hiding from us? Wait a sec!

87
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,500
Hey, Nymph! Why don't you
pick out a cute bra too?!

88
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:36,750
Sohara recommends you
wear something like this,

89
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:38,125
what do you think?

90
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:40,875
No way. What is that crazy
bug-girl even thinking?

91
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:42,708
Why would I wear
something so impractical?

92
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:45,375
It's not armored and it has no
stealth properties whatsoever.

93
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:48,500
But who cares? Don't you think
it looks cuter than cute?!

94
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:51,833
Check this one out!
It's adorable, huh?!

95
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:54,708
Explain this
concept of "cute."

96
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:57,500
Great, another complicated
question. How do I get this

97
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,208
to make sense to her?

98
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:03,750
Instead of explaining what
cute is, how 'bout I show you?

99
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:12,208
See? This is cute!

100
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:16,875
What do you think
of the frilly-ness?

101
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:20,125
Or how sheer the
midsection is? Well?

102
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:23,416
Yes Master, it's
very cute. I agree.

103
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,875
So, Tomoki. Seeing things
that are cute makes you happy?

104
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:29,291
Well, I dunno if
"happy" is the right word,

105
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:31,333
but it's definitely
visually pleasing.

106
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:32,458
Gotcha.

107
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:44,666
What about this?
Am I cute now?

108
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,583
Uh... yeah.

109
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:50,166
Off to a good start then!
I think I'll buy this one

110
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,416
and see what else I can find!

111
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:04,500
Now that I'm a chick, I'm gonna
become the most popular chick

112
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:07,041
in the entire freakin' school!

113
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:16,791
Oh, wow, I'm sorry.
Jeez are you okay?

114
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,750
I'm fine... you perv.

115
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:28,916
Whoa. Now, that
girl's a hottie.

116
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:31,666
What was that all about?

117
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,708
A transfer student
has to make an entrance.

118
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,541
And trust me, having the heroine
show up like this'll be sweet.

119
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:38,500
You really make
no sense sometimes.

120
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:44,166
Ikaros. Nymph, how are you
two doing? Where's Tomoki?

121
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:47,083
He said he had a cold
so he's staying home.

122
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:50,416
No, way. Tomoki caught a cold?
I've known him since forever

123
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,916
and he almost never gets
sick. I hope he'll be okay.

124
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,875
Maybe I should go visit him when
school lets out this afternoon.

125
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:59,958
He'll be fine. It's minor,
but he's still very contagious.

126
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:03,041
So don't go check up
on him. Uh, right Alpha?

127
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:06,250
If you say so.
And you are...?

128
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:09,166
Nice to meet you, my name's
Tomoko. I just transferred here.

129
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:12,041
Hope we get along
like old friends, m'kay?

130
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:15,333
Sure, why not!
Sounds like a plan.

131
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:19,958
Perfect. Sohara doesn't
have a clue what's going on.

132
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:22,250
My plan is going brilliantly.

133
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:24,250
My hobby's making
snacks and finger foods.

134
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:26,583
Today I made cookies.
Go on, take some.

135
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,250
It's my best batch yet.

136
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:29,083
I'll take one.

137
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:30,375
Yeah, a cookie sounds great.

138
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:32,875
These suck!

139
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:33,666
Ew gross!

140
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,625
I'm sorry! I'm such a
ditz! I must've used salt

141
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:39,791
instead of sugar. Gosh! I
hope you guys don't hate me.

142
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:41,875
No way! You're too cute!

143
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:49,666
I just transferred
here like this morning

144
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,416
so I really didn't
have anything else to

145
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,333
wear for Home Ec.
Hope you don't mind. Meow.

146
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:56,583
How cuuuute!

147
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:57,791
That's what
Tomoki's talking about

148
00:09:57,875 --> 00:09:59,333
when he says
something's cute?

149
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:01,541
I believe that is
just what he perceives

150
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:03,416
the "perfect
woman" acts like.

151
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:06,291
So to be cute we
have to say "Meow?"

152
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:08,250
Meow.

153
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:12,708
Umako why won't
you wake up? Why?

154
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:14,291
This is madness and
I never wanted any of it.

155
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:15,833
I got a present
for you, Tomoko.

156
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:17,208
Give me a big smile.

157
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:20,000
Oh, I don't know who I
should give my attention to.

158
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:22,250
Seems Tomoko's the
flavor of the week.

159
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:24,208
Something weird about her,
though. Maybe it's the way she's

160
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,833
put together, she reminds me
of one of those anime chicks.

161
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:29,125
I guess the guys really dig
that. I mean, why the Hell else

162
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:31,166
would they be
fawning all over her?

163
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:33,416
Watching this is enlightening.

164
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:40,666
The time for Gym
has finally arrived!

165
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:46,666
Stay calm, Tomoki. Boldly
go... into the great unknown.

166
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:56,791
I love my life right now!

167
00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:00,625
Hey, Tomoko. You know the
locker next to mine is free

168
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:03,041
if you'd like to use it.
Come on, check it out.

169
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:04,125
Sure!

170
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:10,875
Oh, I'm sorry! I'm
such a klutz sometimes!

171
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:14,875
Tomoko, you can be ridiculously
cute. If Tomoki saw you,

172
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:16,833
he'd fall in love with
you right on the spot.

173
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:17,916
Who?

174
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,916
Oh yeah, Tomoki.
He's this guy I know.

175
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,458
We've been friends
since we were kids.

176
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:23,208
He's in the same class as us,
but you won't see him today.

177
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:25,458
He's out sick. Basically, he's
a perv and a bit of a freak

178
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:27,000
and all he thinks
about is panties.

179
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:28,958
It might sound harmless
and he might call himself a

180
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:30,125
"peace and quiet" loving guy,

181
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:32,166
but actually he's
quite a little predator.

182
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:35,583
I would keep my eye
out for him if I were you.

183
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:37,458
Holy crap, that was harsh!

184
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:39,416
Though... If you're
ever in trouble,

185
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,500
he's the first person
to be at your side,

186
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:44,208
and deep down he
really is a caring person.

187
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:45,916
Maybe I'm
being too hard on him.

188
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,750
Huh?

189
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:49,166
Never mind.
I was just rambling.

190
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:53,750
You pass. I've been
watching your actions today

191
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:56,000
and all of them
exceed my expectations.

192
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:58,083
The way you walk, the
way you move, your voice.

193
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:01,250
Everything is within
normal girl parameters.

194
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:03,708
Even your clumsiness
has grabbed the hearts of

195
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:05,208
some of the geeks out there.

196
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,958
All seems to
be moving smoothly.

197
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:08,416
Score!

198
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,916
Seems I was right to go in
with you on this adventure.

199
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,541
Even Mikako's
intuition isn't flaring up.

200
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:15,541
Tomoki the time is at hand.

201
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:20,208
Come on! Why don't you
call me Tomoko, big boy?!

202
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:22,083
A public bath?

203
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:23,750
Ikaros wanted to
go with everyone.

204
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:26,166
Said it was part of
the human experience.

205
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:30,000
Yeah, so who the
Hell are you again?

206
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,708
My name's Tomoko.

207
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:36,875
I just, uh, I just
transferred here this week.

208
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:38,833
When I was at my last
school I really looked up to

209
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:42,166
my student council president. I
mean seriously she was the best.

210
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,333
I always wanted to get to
know her better than I did.

211
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:46,750
I figure with you I kinda
get that chance at the start.

212
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,208
Please let me go to
the bath with you guys.

213
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:50,583
I just wanna be part of
the group! Is that okay?

214
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,625
Sure... That all
sounds fine to me.

215
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:55,541
Yesss!

216
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:59,708
Lucky for us Tomoki's home
sick. We can have a nice time

217
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:01,916
and not worry about
him spying on us.

218
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,583
That's a relief. Why don't
we get a move on then?

219
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:07,583
I wanna spend as much
time there as I can.

220
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,250
Great work, Tomoki.

221
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:18,500
Now... onward
to the New World!

222
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:33,958
It's been forever since
I've been to a bathhouse.

223
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:59,083
Kick ass, dude! You look
just like a real chick!

224
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:00,916
Now you just gotta work it.

225
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:04,958
It looks like you understand
everything now, Tomoki.

226
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:08,708
By blending in here you'll
be just like any other girl.

227
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:14,416
I can't believe it, this
really is the New World.

228
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:21,625
Master, your heart
rate is becoming erratic.

229
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:23,166
I recommend you
calming down at--

230
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,041
So this is
where you ran off to.

231
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:27,208
I have to monitor
Master's metamorphosis

232
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:28,625
or there could be trouble.

233
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:30,250
Sounds like you're having
a Hell of a time with it.

234
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:32,541
Come on, Alpha, don't
you think this is kinda dumb?

235
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:34,583
It's what Master ordered.

236
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,250
An order... huh?

237
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:41,208
If my orders were
as easy as yours are...

238
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:43,333
I'd be done with my mission.

239
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:47,500
Wow...

240
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:50,583
You're pretty lucky. I bet
you don't ever have to worry.

241
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:51,708
That's not true.

242
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:54,625
I remember something
you said one time.

243
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:58,000
You told me I would not be
able to fool Master forever.

244
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:07,083
If Master knew the truth
about me, he would hate me.

245
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:09,750
And then I would never
get to see him again.

246
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:15,166
But I know... that
lying to him is wrong...

247
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,958
I do not know if I
can keep hiding this

248
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,250
from him day after day.

249
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:25,125
Tomoki'll be fine. Bugs are
all stupid. He'll never notice.

250
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:28,291
He'll bury his head in
the sand like they all do.

251
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:33,625
Hi there Prez! So, uh...
You want me to give your back

252
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:35,791
a good scrub while
you're sittin' there?

253
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,833
Why not? I'll take
you up on that offer.

254
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:42,500
Yes!

255
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:47,791
You've waited so long,
dear hands of mine!

256
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:52,083
And you, my fiendish urges,
your patience will be rewarded!

257
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:54,166
Once more into the abyss!

258
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:57,250
Geronimo!

259
00:15:57,333 --> 00:16:00,833
Oops! Guess my hand slipped!
So sorry about that, Prez!

260
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:07,166
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

261
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,583
What's the matter?
Something up?

262
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:14,708
The metamorphosis of Master's
body has altered in one area.

263
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:17,500
Master, we have a problem.
If your excitement continues

264
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:19,875
at this level, it's possible
an unknown metamorphosis

265
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:22,083
will occur as a result.

266
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,041
Master? Are you there?

267
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:27,541
I can wash you, too.

268
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:29,000
I'm fine.
Don't worry 'bout me.

269
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:31,166
Let loose! There's
nothing to worry about.

270
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,125
I mean, we are
all ladies here!

271
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:39,500
No! That tickles! Stop it!

272
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:43,750
Yes! Yes, yes, yes, yes!

273
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,458
Yes!

274
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:48,208
Yes!

275
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:51,291
Master, do you
require assistance?

276
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:53,500
Master? Can you hear me?

277
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,583
We're all girls here! Yes!

278
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Yes!

279
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:03,333
Yes!

280
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:06,208
Yes!

281
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:09,250
We're all hot girls here!

282
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:15,541
Looks like the poor kid's
completely lost himself.

283
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:18,541
What the Hell's
going on with Tomoko?

284
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:20,666
The bath's turned
into a battlefield.

285
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,416
I'm not saying that's
a bad thing, mind you.

286
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,541
It is horribly
interesting to watch.

287
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:30,041
You must calm down,
Master. If you do not,

288
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:32,416
the quantum
transformation device will--.

289
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:39,041
Yes! Yes! Yes!
Yes-Yes! Yesss!

290
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,333
What on Earth?

291
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:49,000
Someone wanna tell me what
a faucet is doing stuck here?

292
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:53,291
Total meltdown.

293
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:04,583
I... think I'll
take my leave now.

294
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:10,458
Uh, Sohara you
dropped your bath towel.

295
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:12,666
Here, let me pick it up
for you, if that's cool.

296
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:15,666
I don't care if you
see me naked right now.

297
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:18,125
I don't care if the image
stays with you forever...

298
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:20,166
All I care about is
my insatiable desire...

299
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,291
to kill you!

300
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,125
It's a sign of wisdom, Tomoki,
to know when to pull out.

301
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:37,125
That's right. Keep scrubbin'
til it's all good and clean!

302
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:38,875
Yes, ma'am. I will!

303
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:42,541
We can finally bathe in peace.

304
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:46,500
Yep. Shouldn't be anyone
else here but us right now.

305
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:54,125
It's really nice.

306
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:55,791
Yeah, I could
get used to this.

307
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:58,208
With Ikaros still having
those wings sticking out...

308
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:00,125
and Nymph being
worried about her choker,

309
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:02,375
it took guts coming
in here. I mean it.

310
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:04,375
You have more courage
than most girls our age.

311
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:07,083
Jeez, I'm sorry. I didn't even
notice those things might have

312
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:09,500
made you two uncomfortable.
I've just gotten used to

313
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:11,583
the idea of you
two as normal girls.

314
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:13,750
I forget that you're
actually Angeloids.

315
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:15,541
Guess I should get
out of my own head a bit

316
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:17,416
and think about you sometimes.

317
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:21,666
But it makes me happy.
I don't want you to change.

318
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:24,750
I want you to to see me
just as another normal girl.

319
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:28,333
Although what I
really want is to be

320
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:30,791
even more human for Master.

321
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:36,125
You're fine the way you
are. Don't change a thing.

322
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:37,541
And you can't
go around lying,

323
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:39,333
like that time
at the park, okay?

324
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:40,916
I know you better
than you might think

325
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,916
and you're bigger than
that. So no more lying.

326
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,166
So it is a bad thing to lie?

327
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:49,916
Yeah, it's bad. Promise
me you won't do it. There.

328
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,541
It's a promise.
Liar, liar, pants on fire.

329
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:54,791
Hangin' from a telephone wire!

330
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:10,083
I have to tell Master the
truth now. I made a promise.

331
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:13,541
Oh, hey... Glad you were
finally able to take a bath.

332
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:15,875
The old lady in charge of the
bathhouse made me scrub down

333
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:18,041
the whole thing until
it was freakin' spotless.

334
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:21,666
Master... I have
something important to tell you.

335
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:22,916
Huh?

336
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
There is something
I've been hiding from you

337
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:26,333
for a long time
now... But I'm...

338
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:30,125
afraid of what might
happen... if I tell you.

339
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:33,750
I'm afraid you might hate me.

340
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:41,833
Good job, Ikaros.
Seriously, you're becoming

341
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:43,625
more human every day.

342
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:45,458
You don't even
realize it, do you?

343
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Human beings always
have one or two little things

344
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:51,000
they hide from
each other. It's normal.

345
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:53,750
Master...

346
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:54,958
It's fine.

347
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:56,250
I just...

348
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:58,541
It's fine.

349
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,750
When you're ready to
talk about it, let me know.

350
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:05,000
We're family now.

351
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:10,291
What'd I say? I knew
Tomoki would be just fine.

352
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:16,458
I wish I had a nice Master.

353
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:23,125
Sugata, you have any idea what
the Angeloids actually are?

354
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,708
Not like I've got an answer,
but when I was a kid I thought

355
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:29,000
it would be cool to
have a Robot Maid who'd do

356
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:31,875
whatever I wanted.
Really, though... in the end,

357
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:35,875
I don't want Ikaros to
suffer for me. Not in any way.

358
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:41,750
The only thing I know for sure
is that far above us in the sky

359
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:45,083
there is a New World. Ikaros
and Nymph are both trapped

360
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:49,125
by the rules that govern them.
I don't know the specifics.

361
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:54,083
I wonder who
created the Angeloids.

362
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:56,375
I mean somebody had to, right?

363
00:21:57,875 --> 00:21:59,208
I wanna punch 'em.

364
00:23:32,791 --> 00:23:36,500
From here, it looks like Beta is
completely useless on her own.

365
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:39,375
At the rate she's going
now, she might just run away.

366
00:23:39,458 --> 00:23:40,875
Are you okay with that?

367
00:23:40,958 --> 00:23:43,916
I'm not concerned. As long
as I keep hold of this chain,

368
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,041
she cannot escape. Besides, I've
already decided to scrap her.

369
00:23:49,125 --> 00:23:51,625
My goodness,
aren't you awful?

370
00:23:52,958 --> 00:23:56,000
I can't wait. It's been
a while since I've been

371
00:23:56,083 --> 00:23:58,583
this excited about anything.

372
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:06,666
Next Time...
"Chains of No Escape."
