1
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:33,541
Hello, everyone... Eishorou
Sugata here once again.

2
00:00:36,416 --> 00:00:39,166
This here is my assistant,
Pretty the Second.

3
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:40,750
Isn't she lovely?

4
00:00:42,791 --> 00:00:44,625
Five hundred
fifteen years ago...

5
00:00:44,708 --> 00:00:46,833
in the year fourteen
ninety-four...

6
00:00:46,916 --> 00:00:49,583
on June the seventh, the
countries of Portugal and Spain

7
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:51,791
signed the Treaty
of Tordesillas.

8
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:55,125
In fifteen twenty-nine, they
signed the Treaty of Saragossa.

9
00:00:55,541 --> 00:00:57,083
This allowed the great
powers of the day to

10
00:00:57,166 --> 00:00:59,791
effectively split the
world into different regions,

11
00:00:59,875 --> 00:01:01,916
much like the
pattern on a watermelon.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,041
This practice is
called demarcation.

13
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:06,666
This Demarcation is illustrated
here on the watermelon,

14
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,583
showing how the
world was divided up.

15
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:12,041
We could even call this fruit
a figurehead for the New World.

16
00:01:13,166 --> 00:01:16,000
Inside of this ancient
concept, we should be able to

17
00:01:16,083 --> 00:01:18,833
find clues to the New World.

18
00:01:27,083 --> 00:01:30,375
It's very wise to not
take a watermelon lightly.

19
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:10,916
This is really
starting to piss me off.

20
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,500
What are you talking about?

21
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:15,666
Look at this stupid homework
Mister Takehara gave us!

22
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,666
He always dishes out
this crap that no normal

23
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,791
human being could ever solve!

24
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:22,833
It's driving me up the wall.
But I am gonna solve this

25
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:25,750
damn problem, or die
trying! Do you hear me?!

26
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:28,958
Well, good for you,
Tomoki. But hold on a sec.

27
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:32,041
I still don't even understand
what the question is asking.

28
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:33,750
Do you have
the slightest clue?

29
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:35,625
You're not the smartest
girl I know. If I couldn't

30
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:39,041
figure it out, you don't have
a chance in Hell. Get real.

31
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:42,791
What a pain in my ass.

32
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:51,500
Oh, I know. Why don't I get
Ikaros to give me another card?

33
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,500
No way! Everyone in the
world'll be pissed at you

34
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:57,000
if more crap blows
up in our faces!

35
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:59,583
Meh. I thought
it was a good idea.

36
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:02,666
You've gotta take this
seriously. You think you'll ever

37
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,791
get your homework done
if you keep rolling around

38
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:08,083
on the floor like
that? You won't.

39
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:16,708
Are you listening?

40
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,291
Uh yeah. I was... Uh,
just calculating the area of

41
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:27,458
the triangle that's made
from the way you were sitting.

42
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:29,250
Half the base
times the height...

43
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:38,125
This sucks. We
won't get any work done

44
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:39,916
if you keep screwing around.

45
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:42,958
I got it! Sugata could
help teach us some math.

46
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:44,625
He's a real smart guy.

47
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:51,333
Yes, you are certainly
at the Sugata house,

48
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:54,708
but there's no boy named
Eishirou living here. Sorry.

49
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:58,208
That's weird. This is the only
house around here that's got

50
00:04:58,291 --> 00:05:01,541
the Sugata name on the door.
And since we can't raise him

51
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:04,291
on his cell phone, either,
I guess we're S.O.L.

52
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:07,000
Well, if it isn't
Sohara and Tomoki.

53
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:08,250
Oh, hi, Prez.

54
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,541
Yo, how's it hangin'?
Good to see you.

55
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:13,125
You two out on a hot date?

56
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:14,500
Oh, Hell no!

57
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:17,375
Okay. But surely the two
of you are close enough now

58
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:19,125
that you can
bathe together, right?

59
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:20,375
What is wrong with you?!

60
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:23,333
I heard a little rumor,
recently. I heard Tomoki

61
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:26,958
picks out all of your
underwear for you. Is that true?

62
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:29,750
No. Of course it's not.

63
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:31,791
Wasn't it just the other day,
though, when you had her

64
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:34,541
handcuffed after forcibly
removing her panties?

65
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,916
That... That was an accident!

66
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:40,708
Anyway, it looks to
me like the two of you

67
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:42,500
are trying to
find Sugata's place.

68
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:43,875
If you knew that to
begin with why the Hell

69
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:45,541
are you messin'
with our heads?!

70
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:47,666
You'll need to head
down to the riverbank.

71
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:50,333
Would you be opposed to
having me show you the way?

72
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:52,625
The riverbank?

73
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:06,041
This is it?! This flimsy
tent is where you live?!

74
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:08,166
Yeah. What's the problem?

75
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:11,000
You go back and forth from
here to school every day?

76
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:12,500
That's a heck of a commute.

77
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:16,458
That it is. Welcome
to my humble abode.

78
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:18,000
Thanks for having us.

79
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:21,041
But of course.
It's my pleasure.

80
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:25,041
Question three,
part one: Identities.

81
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:29,083
Cosine of x plus sine of i,
minus five equals the cosine

82
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:32,125
of five. The first thing we'll
do is expand the equation

83
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:34,250
on the left side
of the equal sign.

84
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:35,875
If you do that, you get...

85
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:38,666
a problem that's fairly simple
to solve, don't you think?

86
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:41,625
No kidding. If this guy's gonna
pretend to be a mathematician,

87
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:44,291
he should at least try dishing
out some harder equations.

88
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:47,958
Yeah, um. He's on a
whole 'nother level.

89
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:54,416
What's the matter?
Is it too hard?

90
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,125
Hey, yo! Ikaros! You
think you could knock out

91
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,416
the rest of this
equation for me?

92
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,458
An equation? I'll try.

93
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:12,791
I don't get it.
Why'd you give it to her?

94
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:14,791
You should recall.
She said before that

95
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:16,958
she was "created," didn't she?

96
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:20,666
I am a Pet-Class
Angeloid. Ikaros.

97
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,333
I was manufactured
by the Synapse.

98
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:25,166
Oh yeah, she did say that.

99
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:28,416
Basically. If she's really
a robot or something like it.

100
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,625
My assumption is she should

101
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:32,083
have superior
computational abilities.

102
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:33,708
Equation complete.

103
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:34,958
That was fast.

104
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:36,958
Kick ass! So there was
no reason to even bother

105
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:39,083
coming out here
in the first place!

106
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:49,625
I guess I'll do the rest
of the equation myself.

107
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:51,416
I'd really appreciate it.

108
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,250
Man, I was all excited
and then you just wrote

109
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:56,125
"Master" on every page!
And in pen!

110
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:57,458
I gotta turn that in tomorrow!

111
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:59,791
She lacks
computational abilities.

112
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:02,041
But that shouldn't
be the case.

113
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:07,250
Finally, we're finished.

114
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:10,083
Excellent work, you guys.
If you don't mind,

115
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:12,041
a cold drink would
be great right now.

116
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:14,541
No problem. I'll
get it for you, prez.

117
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:23,041
Thank you so much
for your help, Sugata.

118
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:27,250
It was nothing. I'm
happy to help you guys.

119
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:30,000
Why don't ya let us do something
as a way to say thanks?

120
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:32,708
And we won't take
no for an answer.

121
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:34,791
Oh, I'm getting
something in return.

122
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:35,708
Huh?

123
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:40,666
Look at this.

124
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:44,333
It's that black hole
thing you showed us.

125
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:46,500
That computer model
shows the disturbance is

126
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:48,625
still in the
airspace above the city.

127
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:50,625
Up to this point, the
New World has basically been

128
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:52,375
circumnavigating the earth.

129
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:55,166
But currently, it's holding
its position above the city.

130
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,250
This sort of thing
has never happened before.

131
00:08:57,333 --> 00:09:00,583
All I see when I look
up is the beautiful sky.

132
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,750
When I saw it the
night I found Ikaros,

133
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:06,125
it was like this ginormous dark
hole ripped through the sky.

134
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:08,250
Maybe it's refracting light
somehow or hiding behind

135
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:10,291
the clouds. Its
whole nature remains

136
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:12,125
a mystery to
us as of now.

137
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:13,958
Yo, Ikaros! Do me a favor?

138
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:16,458
Fly up and check out
the black hole for us.

139
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:18,375
As you wish, Master.

140
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:39,041
I didn't find anything
out of the ordinary, Master.

141
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:40,875
If she can't find a
problem, there must not be

142
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:42,791
anything screwy going on.

143
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,666
She's gotta be
covering for something.

144
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:49,000
You look like that
bothers you. What's up?

145
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:52,166
I'm fine. Just want
to confirm... a few things

146
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:54,583
for myself. Sorry to say
it might take some time.

147
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:56,750
It's something I'm
going to have to do alone.

148
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,791
You're planning on
flying up there yourself?

149
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:07,583
Yeah. I'm gonna run another
test flight tomorrow.

150
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:09,125
And I'd like the two
of you to help me out

151
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:10,875
if you wouldn't mind.

152
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:12,750
I mean, you have
tomorrow off from school.

153
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:14,000
Why don't you
stay out here tonight?

154
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:14,916
What?!

155
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:16,416
One... two...

156
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,291
Pull!

157
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:19,916
Looks like Sugata and I
will be the ones stuck with

158
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
making the food for everyone.

159
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:24,750
Tomoki and Sohara will be
catching the fish for dinner.

160
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,625
And Ikaros will go out to
do the rest of the shopping.

161
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:29,833
She's gonna do our shopping?
I don't think that's

162
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:31,750
the best idea in the world.

163
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:34,375
I disagree. It might
be a good opportunity.

164
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:36,625
Give her various tasks
and you'll find out, I think,

165
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:39,833
just how powerful she really
is. I'm right to say you

166
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:43,000
still don't know about
most of her abilities, yes?

167
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:45,250
Well, yeah, but...

168
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:47,291
Then consider
this an opportunity

169
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:48,541
for you to learn something.

170
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:50,166
I smell an adventure!

171
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:53,041
You're not helping, Sohara!
She'll never survive out there!

172
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:55,625
She'll be fine on her own.
The people in this town are

173
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:57,333
nice almost to a fault.

174
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:59,666
They'll help her
with whatever she needs.

175
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:03,958
'Kay Ikaros. Listen up,
this is important.

176
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:05,916
You need to run some
errands. And I want you to

177
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,791
act like a normal person.
Think you can do it?

178
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:10,666
Of course, Master.

179
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:13,250
Wait!

180
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:16,375
Before you go you need to
have money, and you need to

181
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:17,958
figure out what it
is you're picking up!

182
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:20,291
Of course, Master.

183
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,791
We're having curry tonight.
Now I'm putting the list

184
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:25,750
right here in your bag.

185
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:29,083
Goodbye, then.
I'll be back soon.

186
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:29,875
Stop!

187
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,291
Do you know any
normal humans who fly

188
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:34,083
when they're
running errands?!

189
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:34,750
I do.

190
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:36,041
Shut up! You do not!

191
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:37,166
I do not.

192
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:00,458
How you doin' today?

193
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:03,916
Um... can I help ya?

194
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:10,500
I-If you like it that much I'll
give it to you at a discount.

195
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:12,166
I just followed her
'cause I was worried.

196
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,041
Now I can't even
tell what she's up to.

197
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:16,291
Hm. Seems she finds
something interesting..

198
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:17,583
What the hell
are you doing here?!

199
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:19,333
I guess we were all
kinda worried about her.

200
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:21,208
I admit I am curious
as to whether she'll

201
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:22,833
get the ingredients we need.

202
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:24,875
Hush. She might just hear us.

203
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:27,375
Look! She's picking
out the vegetables.

204
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:29,083
I must get carrots.

205
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,083
And potatoes.

206
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:34,583
And onions.

207
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:36,875
Ah! So close!

208
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:38,250
That wasn't close at all!

209
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:40,875
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
she bought the watermelon.

210
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:43,250
This is an
intriguing phenomenon.

211
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:49,083
All she has to
buy now is meat.

212
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:51,458
This is where it really
counts. Curry isn't curry

213
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:53,708
without meat in it.
I won't stand for anything

214
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:56,458
called curry without at
least some kind of meat!

215
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:06,041
Now... I must get...
meat... uh...

216
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,083
Never mind! Vegetarian
Curry sounds awesome!

217
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:13,250
I have no problem whatsoever
with deboning a chick.

218
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:21,958
Watermelon... Carrots...
Potatoes... Onions... Meat.

219
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:25,208
Mm! Baby chicken curry.

220
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:29,791
You can't kill it! No!

221
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:33,000
I almost forgot.
The base for the curry.

222
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:35,458
I don't think you make
curry with soy sauce.

223
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:39,750
Master. Did I not shop
correctly for meal preparation?

224
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:42,958
You get an F for shopping.
You're gonna need

225
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:45,166
a Hell of a lot more practice.

226
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:48,916
I'm sorry, Master.

227
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:53,708
I guess for your first
time, you didn't do so bad.

228
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,291
Really. Good job, Ikaros.

229
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:07,708
Yeah, don't worry, Mom.
I'm here with everyone else,

230
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:10,708
so I'll be safe.
See you tomorrow.

231
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:15,291
Check it! I caught one!

232
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:17,708
Tomo! That's excellent.

233
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:22,291
Holy crap! You gotta
help! What do I do with--

234
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:28,750
My god, I'm so wet!

235
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:35,875
Nooooo!

236
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:38,333
Hey, Tomoki?

237
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:40,541
Whadda ya want?

238
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:42,666
I can't find Ikaros.
Any idea where she is?

239
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,458
Oh, for cryin' out loud.

240
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,666
Where'd that
dumb girl run off to?

241
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:50,500
Hey! Ikaros!

242
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:52,416
Stop yelling.
I hear something.

243
00:14:58,708 --> 00:14:59,750
What the hell was that?

244
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:01,125
Some kind of shockwave.

245
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,541
We got another one
coming. Hit the deck!

246
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,500
What is that
thing on her back?!

247
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:22,583
A pirarucu. Lives in
the rivers of South America.

248
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:24,750
It is the world's
largest freshwater fish.

249
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:26,166
Like, the Amazon?!

250
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,875
How did you get all the
way there and back so quick?

251
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,791
I have the ability to fly at an
air speed of Mach twenty-four.

252
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:35,291
Whoa! Mach twenty-four?!

253
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:37,041
Moving at Mach twenty-four,
considering other variables.

254
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:38,916
That's thirty thousand
kilometers per hour?

255
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,541
Well, since she brought
it all the way here,

256
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:44,041
let's clean that fish, too.
It'd make a great side dish.

257
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:46,458
I wonder if something
like that is even edible.

258
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:52,958
All right, Sugata. What's
got your panties in a twist?

259
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:54,708
Well, Mikako...

260
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:56,666
These are the specs on Ikaros.

261
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,833
That's correct.
Her maximum speed is--

262
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,375
Kind of a waste, isn't it?

263
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:04,625
An angel with
seemingly unlimited power.

264
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:08,041
I mean, she's faster than
the world's top fighter jets.

265
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:15,458
But she calls herself
"Pet-Class." Gimme a break.

266
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:18,250
Let's eat!

267
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:21,416
Killer. You actually
made some real curry!

268
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,833
Shocking as it may
sound, Ikaros made it.

269
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:27,125
That's awesome. You tried your
best and it really shows, too.

270
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:28,250
Thanks a lot.

271
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:35,750
This is the best.

272
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:40,791
It's just like Mom used to make!
Beautiful! The sweetness...

273
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,958
Hold up! It's just
meat and potatoes.

274
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:44,833
And I think I taste sugar.

275
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:46,416
It doesn't
make any difference.

276
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,375
Meat and potatoes are the basic
ingredients of curry, right?

277
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:51,666
No, I'm pretty
sure that's curry.

278
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:55,666
Yeah, it wasn't
that funny, Sohara.

279
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:59,208
I know, sorry! It's just,
ever since Ikaros showed up

280
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:02,416
it seems like there's
always something to laugh at!

281
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,333
I guess she didn't do this
to our dinner on purpose.

282
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:10,750
Pardon. Master? I am curious
as to what you were laughing at.

283
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:14,125
What do you mean? We're just
laughing to have a good time!

284
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:15,750
Isn't that reason enough?

285
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:20,750
Having a good time.
You mean, like fun?

286
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:25,791
Nothing out of the ordinary.

287
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:46,708
What are you, really?

288
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,958
If you didn't hear me, I'm
asking you what you are.

289
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:06,000
I am a Pet-Class Angeloid.
Type: Alpha.

290
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:08,791
Don't play dumb with me. Would
anything that's just a pet

291
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:12,958
have the need to, or be designed
to, catch a gigantic fish alive,

292
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:14,958
or fly at Mach twenty-four?

293
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:17,583
But at the same time,
your computational ability is

294
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:21,583
that of a baby. It also seems
that your emotions are limited.

295
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:26,541
Both completely perfect
and completely imperfect.

296
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:29,625
Just. What. Are you?

297
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:34,750
Answer me. Why have
you sought out Tomoki?

298
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:36,625
There has to be a reason.

299
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:41,541
I do not know.
I am unaware of what

300
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:43,708
my purpose should
be on this world.

301
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:45,208
What do you mean?

302
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:48,791
I stay by his side. Those
are the orders Master gave me,

303
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:51,250
and that is the only reason
I have for remaining here

304
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:54,875
with him. But in doing so,
I am constantly causing him

305
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:58,250
great distress, and I do not
know how to make that stop.

306
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:03,708
Much like how Master is
angry with me right now.

307
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:05,875
I am sure you
have noticed this.

308
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:09,125
I can't help but wonder if I
were to leave Master's side...

309
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:11,500
maybe he would be better off.

310
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,125
She doesn't have the first clue
what she is any more than I do.

311
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:18,333
So the problem
becomes a question.

312
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:20,708
Who sent Ikaros to Tomoki?

313
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:25,541
You should just do
your best to have fun.

314
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:28,541
You should just do what
you can to have a good time

315
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,458
while you're around Tomoki.

316
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:38,416
And then you pray that the
day you two part never comes.

317
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:50,458
Wind: check. Positioning: check.
Weather conditions: good.

318
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:52,125
Now hit the sky, Tomoki!

319
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:55,041
Aren't you the one supposed
to be doing this insanity?!

320
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,833
Everything's an
experience! Now go!

321
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:01,125
Take off!

322
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:03,500
You're a demon!
The devil incarnate!

323
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,583
Say what you will.
This is repayment for

324
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:07,166
all the homework help.

325
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,125
Tomoki, don't let go!

326
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:12,041
A fall like that will take
him weeks to recover from.

327
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:14,333
I guess my calculations
are still a tad off.

328
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:15,500
Which means that...

329
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:18,166
Pardon me... May I
ask you a question?

330
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,708
What is it?

331
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:23,000
You see, I was just wondering
if... if my Master's master

332
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:25,541
has fun when he
is around Master?

333
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:29,708
I've been trying, but I still
don't think I really understand

334
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:34,000
what this word called
"fun" means. But I guess...

335
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:35,166
But what?

336
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:37,500
When I am with Master...

337
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:41,875
my heart feels lighter.

338
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:45,750
Like it's trying to fly right
out of my chest all on its own.

339
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,666
That makes sense.

340
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,583
Then you should make that
your homework assignment.

341
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:55,666
And I will expect you to turn
in a report to me in one day.

342
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,416
Understood.

343
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:00,250
I'm back!

344
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:03,500
And I'm exhausted.

345
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:04,875
I'm glad you walked
away from that fall

346
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:06,541
with just cuts and bruises.

347
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:13,208
You brought the
watermelon back with you?

348
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:14,583
Correct.

349
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:16,583
Well, in that case, I
suppose we should have some.

350
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:21,208
You really like that
watermelon, don't you?

351
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:28,000
'Least our homework's done.

352
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:30,000
Yeah. And our
impromptu camping trip

353
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:31,958
was a whole lotta fun, too.

354
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,166
It gets funnier
every time I look at it.

355
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:41,416
Tell me, Master.
Do you have a good time

356
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,125
when I am here with you?

357
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:45,875
Boy do I ever, Ikaros.
There's never a dull moment

358
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:48,375
with you around,
that's for sure.

359
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,666
But before we get
started tonight folks,

360
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:55,333
I got a question. What's the
deal with these new HDTV's?

361
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:57,666
What're you scribblin'
on over there, Ikaros?

362
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,875
I am writing on my homework.

363
00:23:49,916 --> 00:23:51,916
The stupid screws are loose.

364
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:02,250
Would you stop messing
with the toilet seat?!

365
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:07,416
Next time... "Love and
Triangles... Revisited."
