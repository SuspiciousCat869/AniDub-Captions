1
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:33,041
Your arms go through
the sleeves like this.

2
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:36,041
Then you cross the
left side over the right.

3
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:39,250
And that's all you
have to do. Easy, huh?

4
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:41,416
Like this?

5
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,750
Oh man, look at
all that potential!

6
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:45,666
I just hope she keeps
growing into her body!

7
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,833
Come on... What do you
call these clothes again?

8
00:00:47,916 --> 00:00:50,416
There's people with a
fetish for that sorta thing.

9
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,500
I think I see where
they're comin' from!

10
00:00:52,583 --> 00:00:54,916
It's a type of
kimono called a yukata.

11
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,875
Oh and there's a festival goin'
on today at the shrine nearby.

12
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:01,500
Oh... Master.

13
00:01:04,375 --> 00:01:06,541
Well. Fun while it lasted.

14
00:01:08,291 --> 00:01:10,166
Get out of here, you pervert!

15
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:45,333
One could say that the Age of
Exploration... which started in

16
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:48,750
the fifteenth century, was an
era of brutal colonization when

17
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:50,333
the people of
Western Europe began

18
00:02:50,416 --> 00:02:52,166
exploring and
mapping the globe.

19
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,458
It's said in the right hand,
the Europeans carried

20
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:57,041
a gun and in
the left, a bible.

21
00:02:57,125 --> 00:02:59,458
Everywhere they traveled
they discovered new worlds...

22
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:02,125
and wasted little
time in occupying them.

23
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:04,125
In many ways, the
invention of the musket was

24
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:06,958
the ultimate symbol
of mankind's subjugation

25
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:09,125
over these newly
conquered worlds.

26
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:32,958
In the right hand... a gun.

27
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,375
Wow, look at all the
people here this year!

28
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:45,750
There's cotton candy!
Oh, and takoyaki and yakisoba!

29
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:47,583
All you ever
yap about is food.

30
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:49,000
So? What's it to you?

31
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:51,166
If you keep eating
like this you'll get fat.

32
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:54,208
Just kidding!
Forget I said anything!

33
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:01,875
Hey, Nymph. You want one?

34
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:03,208
No way!

35
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:07,500
Yo, Ikaros! Let me
know if you want anything.

36
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:08,791
I'll buy it for ya!

37
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,416
All right... These.

38
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,875
What?! I think
one will suffice!

39
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:19,416
Tomo! Come check out
these other booths with me!

40
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,875
Be right there!

41
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:24,416
What's all this?

42
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:29,500
Holy crap!

43
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:38,416
Welcome to my booth.

44
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:44,458
Can we go, Tomoki? Gun-freaks
like this kinda weird me out.

45
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:47,875
There're only
guns and ammunition.

46
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:49,708
I don't see any prizes.

47
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:53,166
If this is a rifle range,
where are the targets

48
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,791
we're supposed to shoot at?

49
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:56,666
Sugata, what're
you doing here?

50
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,750
Oh, Mikako invited me along.

51
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:01,583
What is a festival exactly?

52
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,958
I believe a festival is
an event that the entire town

53
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:09,041
can enjoy together as one.

54
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:10,583
Mikako?

55
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:13,958
That's why we, the Satsukitane
family, have hired a pro to

56
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:16,833
oversee a night of fun
and danger in the woods.

57
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:19,750
Our hope is that it
will unite the entire town.

58
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:21,833
I've got a bad
feeling about this.

59
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:25,041
The rules are simple. We
will play a game of survival

60
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:28,083
using these cork guns.
The last person standing

61
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:30,666
will win a truly
fantastic prize!

62
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,750
A fantastic prize, huh?

63
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:36,666
Ten million yen...
in cold, hard cash.

64
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:42,125
Interesting. That would
be quite the windfall.

65
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:43,833
Enough to buy your dreams.

66
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:45,250
Sugata!

67
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:48,291
Wow, that sounds like a
blast! What do you say, Tomo?

68
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:49,791
You wanna do it?!

69
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:54,583
I can't deny it. Ten million
sounds pretty damn nice,

70
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:56,333
but I can't shake the
feeling like something's

71
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:58,500
gonna go horribly wrong.

72
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:07,166
Hey Nymph, are
you getting cold feet?

73
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:10,791
Just not interested.
Not in the slightest.

74
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:14,875
Okay, fellow neighbors, are
you ready? Then let's get crazy

75
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:17,750
and shoot the living
Hell out of each other!

76
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:22,708
May the survival
game... begin!

77
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,833
No way I'm lettin' myself
get caught in the crossfire.

78
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:30,833
Just need to find a nice,
secure place to hide.

79
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,958
Where do ya think
you're goin', skinny boy?!

80
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:36,416
It's the old bag from
the community center!

81
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,000
I thought you had a bad hip!

82
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:40,625
It was a miracle! The
pain just vanished soon as

83
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:42,375
I heard about the ten mil!

84
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:47,541
Get your ass back here!
Show me some respect!

85
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:49,916
Don't you know I used
to change your diapers?!

86
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:55,625
Stay right there.
You're mine, bitch!

87
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:56,958
The Veggie Lady?

88
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,333
Move one inch and you're dead!

89
00:06:58,416 --> 00:06:59,708
The Fishmonger!

90
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:06,791
Look girls, there goes Tomoki!

91
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:11,500
The girls from my class too? Why
the Hell is everyone after me?!

92
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:14,333
Oh come now, Tomoki.
It's nice to feel loved!

93
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:17,125
If this is love,
I want no part of it!

94
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:22,166
Hey, wait a minute.
Where'd he go?

95
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,708
Hope I'm safe now.

96
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:25,208
The Hell you are!

97
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:26,416
Oh crap!

98
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:29,708
I'm takin' you out!

99
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,333
Whoa, grandma!

100
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:39,583
We got a sniper!

101
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:40,875
Where's he at?!

102
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,458
He's in the trees!

103
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,958
There must be
another sniper nearby.

104
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:06,750
That round was shot with
a cunning level of stealth.

105
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:10,416
It was accurate,
missing me by mere inches.

106
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,500
There's no doubt who it is.

107
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:15,791
Mikako... I knew it!

108
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:34,500
You are quite skilled.

109
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:36,291
You are not so bad yourself.

110
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,125
Holy crap! Someone
freakin' save me!

111
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:42,291
Looks like
we're at a stalemate.

112
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:44,458
Well, then let's fight dirty!

113
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,208
Man, if I knew this was gonna
happen I would've let you guys

114
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:52,625
shoot me before
the game even started!

115
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,125
What...

116
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:06,250
Is that?

117
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:24,083
This is the end of the world!
God has come to destroy us!

118
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:27,083
This is His final judgment!

119
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:32,750
Hey! Don'tcha think
you're overdoing it a bit?!

120
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:35,500
You've had your fun now get down
here and stay outta trouble!

121
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:37,125
Yes, Master.

122
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Man... She took
out a lot of people.

123
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:41,791
Really thinned
out the competition.

124
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:44,541
Of course... now I
have an actual chance at

125
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:49,041
baggin' the ten million.
Yes! Time to murder!

126
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:04,875
What did it feel like? Brutally
slaughtering all those pathetic

127
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:07,625
little people below you?
Bring back any memories?

128
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:09,000
Huh?

129
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:11,333
Of course it doesn't.
We both know all your memory

130
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:13,541
and thought
processes are protected.

131
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:18,666
I'd be more than happy to help
you remember who you really are.

132
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:22,541
Uranus Queen, the frightening
entity who shook the Synpase...

133
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,458
to it's very core!

134
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:31,166
Well now. Did that
happen to jog any memories

135
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,083
in that stubborn
head of yours?

136
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:38,791
I am... a Pet Class
Angeloid... Type Alpha.

137
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:41,458
A pet class?
Don't make me laugh.

138
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,583
I have been given strict
orders by my own Master to

139
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:46,666
return you back
to the Synapse.

140
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:49,916
That which is lost,
must be returned to

141
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,500
its rightful owner... Alpha.

142
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:02,333
This is why I warned
you to be careful.

143
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:17,541
I am Nymph, an Electronic
Warfare Class Angeloid,

144
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:22,041
Type Beta, and I have come here
to take you home, Uranus Queen.

145
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:24,833
I am a Pet Class Angeloid...

146
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:28,083
Stop sayin' that. Wake up!

147
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:33,208
Oops, looks like I may've
gone a little overboard.

148
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:41,250
I am... A Pet Class Angeloid.

149
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:46,083
Fine, then I guess
you leave me no choice.

150
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:47,833
I'll remove your
memory protection with

151
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:51,208
my hacking system.
And once I'm finished,

152
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:53,125
you'll understand
why I scoff at the

153
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:56,916
idea of you being
a Pet Class anything!

154
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:05,083
I... What is this I'm seeing?

155
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:09,625
Ikaros... I command you to
destroy those surface insects.

156
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:11,416
Take no prisoners.

157
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,500
Yes... Master.

158
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:17,166
These memories. What are they?

159
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:34,958
Make it stop!

160
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:38,666
I'm sorry I got mad at you last
night. I swear it's just...

161
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:41,458
You looked like some Killer
Android Weapon like you'd

162
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:43,333
see in a movie or something.

163
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:47,125
I guess it caught me off-guard
and I kinda freaked out.

164
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:51,375
Master.

165
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:09,791
Was it really so bad
you had to burst into tears?

166
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:13,541
Guess your dream of being a Pet
Class has exploded in your face.

167
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:21,083
Wait. It doesn't make sense.
How are you... able to cry?

168
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:24,000
I didn't finish. I removed
your memory protections,

169
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:27,208
but never actually disabled
your thought protections!

170
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:36,041
Emotional Protection Removal:
one hundred percent...

171
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:39,000
Variable Wing Protection
Removal: processing...

172
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:40,750
No... Is she...?

173
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:43,708
Self-repair Sequence:
activated...

174
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:47,750
Functionality Protection
Removal: processing...

175
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:51,250
I think the Uranus Queen...
is about to reawaken!

176
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:58,291
Self-recovery: complete.
Target... lock on.

177
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:01,125
Commence firing Artemis.

178
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:12,000
What happened? Why are
all the protections removed?

179
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:14,083
Now she's fully awakened!

180
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:21,458
Son of a--!

181
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:35,833
It's mud! I've got
mud on my face! How gross!

182
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:41,666
It's so nasty! I'm
disgusting! I hate mud!

183
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:48,958
I'm gonna... rip you into
shreds! Paradise Song!

184
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:55,875
Ae-Aegis!

185
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:06,125
That's... Apollo!

186
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:09,958
Whoa, whoa, hold it!
You're gonna destroy

187
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:11,333
the whole country with that!

188
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:13,541
No, just you. When
the projectile hits

189
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:15,083
its point of contact...

190
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:18,166
I'll set Aegis to full power...
protecting everything else.

191
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:22,541
That's ridiculous! You'd end up
hurting yourself as much as me!

192
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:25,541
I will be returning
to my Master.

193
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:28,791
I am a Pet Class Angeloid...

194
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:36,041
Type Alpha, Ikaros. Please,
Nymph... Go home. Leave.

195
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,208
I beg you.

196
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:49,166
Okay, fine... But...

197
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:54,000
How much longer do you think
you'll be able to fool him, huh?

198
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:57,833
I can't help but wonder... what
your true Master would think

199
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:59,875
if he learned what
you were doing here...

200
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:03,208
Little Miss Weapon... of Death!

201
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:15,333
Master told me to
stay out of trouble,

202
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:19,666
but I did not. I failed him.

203
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:23,625
Oh man, how many
left can there be?!

204
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:25,500
This game's like
a damn zombie movie,

205
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:27,625
it's really
wearin' my ass out!

206
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:29,791
Hey, are you even
listening to me?!

207
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:40,833
What the Hell?
Don't tell me you're using

208
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,750
a real freakin' gun?!

209
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:46,125
Well... sort of...
I mixed in a live round.

210
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:48,875
I did that to a
few of the guns so

211
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:50,791
don't be surprised
if it happens again.

212
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:53,041
Tomo! I found you!

213
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:54,375
Huh?!

214
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:56,791
I've been looking for you.
I searched everywhere,

215
00:16:56,875 --> 00:17:02,583
but you were gone. It sucks
being left behind. Bastard!

216
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:05,708
Hey, gun dude! Does that
one have real bullets too?!

217
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,875
Hands to the sky, Tomoki!

218
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:07,875
Yeah... So?

219
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:14,000
Wow! They sure don't
make toys like they used to!

220
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:15,833
That felt like the real thing!

221
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:18,083
Sohara, wait! You're insane!

222
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:20,000
This is so much fun!

223
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:21,750
You're possessed!
Don't you realize you're

224
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,083
shooting real bullets?!

225
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:25,625
I'm so close to winning
this thing I can taste it!

226
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:28,125
I'll do whatever it takes to get
my hands on that ten million!

227
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:29,750
Waaaaaaah!

228
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:32,083
I can think of so many things
I could do with that much cash!

229
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:34,166
The possibilities
are endless!

230
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:37,375
Like I could take Tomo
to an amusement park...

231
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:39,375
Or we could go
on a trip together.

232
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,708
Then once we're back in
the room for the night...

233
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:43,166
Oh Tomo! What's that?

234
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:46,208
You wanna get in the
bath with me? Ya silly pervo!

235
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:53,375
Tomo's a creep! Tomo's a
creep! Tomo's a pervy creep!

236
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:54,750
Now run your
little ass outta here!

237
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:56,208
Calm down already!

238
00:17:58,125 --> 00:17:59,541
No wait! Stay back!

239
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:02,250
Listen to me... Do you realize
we're the only people left

240
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:05,416
in the game? I have a one
in two chance of winning!

241
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,666
Okay, I get it, you really want
to win. But even if you did,

242
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,791
what would you even
do with ten million?

243
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:13,041
I would... I'd make you...

244
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:17,250
No! I can't say it!

245
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:21,333
It's too embarrassing! You
filthy, disgusting pervert!

246
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:24,833
Somebody... Save me!

247
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,791
What... just happened?

248
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:52,375
Ikaros!

249
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,750
Yes?

250
00:18:58,083 --> 00:19:01,500
Man. What the heck is
your skin made of anyway?

251
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:03,125
I thought we'd lost ya there.

252
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,458
So, anyone see
where Nymph ran off to?

253
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:15,416
She probably got bored and
went home, you know how she is.

254
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,500
I wouldn't really
worry 'bout it too much.

255
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:20,375
Let's address the
elephant in the room.

256
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:22,000
Who's gonna
win the 10 million?

257
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:23,958
Oh right! It's still on!

258
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:26,541
It looks like the only
two left are you and Sohara.

259
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:28,500
Should make for
an interesting finish.

260
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:29,916
Son of a bitch!

261
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,750
Not quite. You forgot someone.

262
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:45,333
Let's have some
fun... mama's boy.

263
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:25,750
And the winner is... the
guy from the rifle range!

264
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:29,375
Your half. As promised, sir.

265
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:30,541
Thank you.

266
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:38,708
See you next year!

267
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:42,375
What?! You want
to do this again?!

268
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:23,208
Master.

269
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:27,625
Oh hey, Ikaros... Man am
I totally bushed after today.

270
00:22:33,708 --> 00:22:36,625
Look at this. What happened?
Your yukata's all dirty.

271
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:41,916
What the hell?
Are you all right?

272
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,916
Your arm's covered in bruises.

273
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,416
I'm fine.

274
00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:50,750
It's so weird. Your skin feels
as soft as a real girl's,

275
00:22:50,833 --> 00:22:53,166
and yet somehow a
bullet bounced off it.

276
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:54,833
Like it was made of rubber.

277
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,666
So... did you jump in
front of that bullet for me

278
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:59,625
because you knew
you wouldn't get hurt?

279
00:22:59,708 --> 00:23:02,208
No! I was as surprised as you.

280
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:05,750
Oh great, you were surprised!

281
00:23:05,833 --> 00:23:08,166
You had no idea what
would happen to you!

282
00:23:13,416 --> 00:23:16,458
Look, it was nice and all,
but don't ever do it again.

283
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:26,291
I know you think you have
to risk your own life to

284
00:23:26,375 --> 00:23:30,125
protect mine, but that whole
concept makes me uneasy.

285
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:33,166
You're a person too.
You shouldn't have to be

286
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:35,625
put in that kind of situation.

287
00:24:04,125 --> 00:24:07,958
Next time... "The Delusional
Story that Began with a Lie."
