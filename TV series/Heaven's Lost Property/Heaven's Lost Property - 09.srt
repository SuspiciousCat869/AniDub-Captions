1
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:31,791
You failed.

2
00:00:31,875 --> 00:00:34,708
Instead of bringing the Uranus
Queen to us as instructed,

3
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:36,916
you allowed her to awaken.

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,541
I apologize, Master.

5
00:00:39,458 --> 00:00:42,041
You have failed us
for the last time, Beta.

6
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:44,958
Those insects have never come
close to finding the Synapse.

7
00:00:45,041 --> 00:00:48,208
After several thousand years,
what purpose does she serve?

8
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:51,083
The Electronic Warfare
Class Angeloid is obsolete.

9
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:54,375
Wait, don't do that. I'll
get her next time, I promise.

10
00:00:54,458 --> 00:00:56,166
What can you possibly
do to take down

11
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,791
the Uranus Queen
now that she's awakened?

12
00:00:59,666 --> 00:01:01,208
Wait a moment...

13
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:04,833
I have an idea.

14
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:08,625
What are you--?

15
00:01:14,625 --> 00:01:16,291
The wine is quite good.

16
00:01:22,208 --> 00:01:27,708
I am so horrifyingly bored
being up here. Entertain me.

17
00:01:27,791 --> 00:01:30,791
Whatever you ask
of me... Master.

18
00:01:46,208 --> 00:01:49,208
During the Age of Discovery...
There was a setback aboard

19
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:51,625
the ship on which
Columbus was sailing.

20
00:01:51,708 --> 00:01:53,916
His sailors were having
doubts about their long journey

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,625
and in their despair
attempted a mutiny.

22
00:01:57,041 --> 00:01:58,208
I see.

23
00:01:59,791 --> 00:02:01,541
So Columbus lied to them. He
entered a much shorter journey

24
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:03,458
into the ship's log
than the real figures,

25
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:05,541
of which he
was perfectly aware.

26
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:08,166
Having believed these figures,
the men continued their journey

27
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,458
and that crew is said to
have eventually discovered

28
00:02:10,541 --> 00:02:12,666
the New World.
You could actually say--

29
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:16,291
You could say... it's a
tale that started with a lie.

30
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:19,666
A tale of the discovery
of the New World.

31
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:22,583
Mikako... Just what
are you doing?

32
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:24,833
Well, clearly
I'm your assistant.

33
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:26,666
Weren't you looking
for a new one?

34
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,208
I figured you'd be
lonely all by yourself,

35
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:31,666
so I thought I'd come
help you out some.

36
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:35,333
I'm Pretty number Three.
At your service!

37
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:45,333
It's the perfect
weather for a barbeque.

38
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:50,375
Holy crap! This place
is swimming with people!

39
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:51,791
Over here!

40
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:56,333
A few of my men are holding
down a spot for us nearby.

41
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:59,000
And look... in the shade!.

42
00:03:03,458 --> 00:03:06,750
Hey, Tomoki. Nymph
hasn't come back yet has she?

43
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:09,750
No not yet. She's probably
back visiting her homeland up

44
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:13,166
in the sky. Geez... What a load.
She drops in outta nowhere,

45
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,291
then vanishes into thin air.

46
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:15,708
We should start
setting everything up.

47
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:19,041
Hang on, where's Ikaros?

48
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:29,500
Don't do that, lady.
You'll break it.

49
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:33,125
Ikaros! What are you
doing over here, you idiot?!

50
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:35,666
Sorry about that sir.
I'll pay for the whole thing.

51
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,500
How much're we talking 'bout?

52
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:42,875
No freakin' way! This is huge!
This is that legendary DVD!

53
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:46,125
The ridiculously perverted one
with all of the bouncy goodness!

54
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:49,125
"The Age of Warring
Boobs: G-Cup Rebellion!"

55
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:51,125
It's nothing short of
a miracle that I've found

56
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:53,375
this sucker here,
of all places.

57
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:56,458
I'll uh... I'll take this.

58
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:59,250
Damn it! No cash!

59
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:08,791
Excuse me... Master?
I'm sorry that happened.

60
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,416
I need to act normal.
I have to find a way to be

61
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,500
more like
the humans I know.

62
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:21,708
Little Miss
Weapon... of Death!

63
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:26,000
But how? How do humans act?

64
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:27,708
I can't believe
you said that.

65
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:29,875
Aw, come on.
It's only human to lie.

66
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:33,375
That's terrible.
So you've lied to me?

67
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:38,375
To act human is to lie.

68
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:44,291
Welcome back, Tomoki.

69
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:46,833
And Ikaros. The
meat'll be done soon.

70
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:51,291
To act human is to
lie. Um, Sohara...

71
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:52,500
Yeah, what's up?

72
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:54,875
I just wanted you to
know that I hate you.

73
00:04:57,208 --> 00:05:00,000
No one thinks you're cute.
In fact everyone thinks

74
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:02,875
you're quite unattractive.
You appear to be kind,

75
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:05,458
but you're actually
a very violent person.

76
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:06,875
But... why?

77
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:09,750
I also think you're
just a little too skinny.

78
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,458
And that's a bad thing?

79
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:14,916
Anyway, I just wanted to let
you know. Those are the reasons

80
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,250
I hate you as much as I do.

81
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:26,083
The New World
doesn't exist, Sugata.

82
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:28,625
And Prez, you're...

83
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:29,791
I'm what?

84
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:34,708
You're a... very nice person.

85
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:37,500
Oh, stop... You're
making me blush.

86
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:39,333
I don't get it!
That's the opposite of

87
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:41,333
what you said about me!

88
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:46,250
And as for you Tomoki... I don't
want to be with you anymore.

89
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:49,833
I don't want to
be with you anymore.

90
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:00,916
Is this crap the
best you can cook?!

91
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,791
I thought I was a good person.

92
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:05,291
You two are pretty lucky to
be able to get drunk off soda.

93
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:07,666
We're still not even
close to old enough to drink

94
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,750
so we have to find
something, don't we?

95
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:12,541
I don't think it's something
to be this upset over.

96
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:15,375
I just can't help it.
No one has ever talked to

97
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:18,875
me like that before.
Ikaros is such a meanie.

98
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:22,958
Well, then by all means,
drink yourself stupid!

99
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:25,958
Nymph has up and vanished...
and Ikaros doesn't wanna be

100
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:28,625
with me anymore...
This sucks!

101
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:31,000
Everybody's just doin'

102
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:33,625
whatever the
hell they want! Damn!

103
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:36,750
I need somethin' to take
my mind off this crap...

104
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:39,708
cuz if not it's
gonna drive me nuts!

105
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:45,375
The takoyaki you're serving...
looks like poop on a stick.

106
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:48,250
You've got a beautiful
thick head of hair.

107
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:51,000
Your baby is
uglier than you are.

108
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:54,666
Finally I'm acting human.

109
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:59,041
You look like you're
having a good time, Alpha.

110
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:00,125
Hello, Nymph.

111
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:04,250
What are you doing here?

112
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:07,416
Wanna do me a favor and
disable your Artemis lock-on?

113
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,250
Cuz if you don't, those missile
alarms ringing in my head

114
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:12,750
are gonna drive me
up the nearest wall.

115
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:15,291
I'm not here to tell
people who you really are.

116
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:16,875
Nothing like that.
And it's not like

117
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:18,083
I could ever
beat you in battle.

118
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:21,333
So you can relax a
bit, girl. Don't worry.

119
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:23,791
I just wanna see what's
happening on my soap opera.

120
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:26,416
Maybe hang around a
little longer, y'know.

121
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:28,333
Sure.

122
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:32,916
Tell me, Alpha. Don't you
think you're a bit subservient

123
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
to your new master down here?
These stupid bugs are just

124
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:38,375
trash to us, they're nothing.

125
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,666
I still don't get
what you're trying to do.

126
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:43,250
But unless you wanna destroy
your relationship with him,

127
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:46,583
don't even mention what
happened between you and me.

128
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:53,750
Fooled her completely.
She has no clue the only reason

129
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:55,958
I'm here is to take her back.

130
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:59,083
P-stealth System, activate.

131
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:01,833
I will follow my master's
orders. Even though I've got

132
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:03,791
no way to outstrip
her firepower,

133
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:06,416
I'm gonna take her back
into the sky with me.

134
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:11,083
But to achieve that, I gotta
do something else first.

135
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:19,583
I'm takin' her precious master
hostage. See how she likes that.

136
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,125
So sorry, Alpha.

137
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:23,666
You think that's enough
to keep out of sight?

138
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,125
Because I can see you!

139
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:29,208
Wait, what?!
How is this possible?

140
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Gotta try harder to
keep from my prying eyes!

141
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,541
I can see freakin' everything!

142
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:40,416
That's the stuff
baby! Yeah, do it!

143
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,791
What are you doing?

144
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:44,125
What does it look like?
I'm watching people do it.

145
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:46,666
Nothing like a live
show to cheer me up.

146
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:51,500
Since I can't afford the DVD.
Wait, who's there? Nymph!

147
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:57,458
What are those
two people doing?

148
00:08:57,541 --> 00:09:00,375
It looks like the woman
is taking off her clothes...

149
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:02,958
Don't look! And where the
Hell have you been?! Huh?!

150
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:06,458
You freakin' vanished into thin
air! You can't pull that crap!

151
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:07,958
Whatever, who cares?

152
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:09,916
I care, dummy!
If you're gonna leave,

153
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,416
at least let me know first!

154
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,833
You have any idea how much
I've been worrying about you?!

155
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:16,000
You've been worried?

156
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:18,250
Of course I have!
I mean, sure, you're a

157
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:20,708
self-centered freeloader.
But that doesn't mean you can

158
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:23,125
just disappear
without telling anybody!

159
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:24,833
Yeah, okay.

160
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:29,166
Hang on! I'm here
to take him hostage,

161
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:32,875
not get ordered around! What
am I doing listening to him?!

162
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:35,708
Good. Now as punishment
you have to do everything

163
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:38,458
I tell you today.
Understand me?

164
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:41,541
Now let's go!
You're comin' with me!

165
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:44,125
N-No! Wait!

166
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:55,625
So what're you...
doing again?

167
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:58,041
Can't you tell by lookin'?
There's a flea market goin' on.

168
00:09:58,125 --> 00:09:59,500
I'm settin' up a booth.

169
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:03,041
I need that DVD
but I am flat broke.

170
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:04,625
Therefore, my
brilliant plan is to

171
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:08,666
sell off all my old crap. And
then the boobies will be mine!

172
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:11,291
I am a freakin' genius!

173
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:14,666
You think this junk'll sell?

174
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:17,708
Maybe... That's why I needed
someone to help me out.

175
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:19,375
So here's what you do...

176
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:21,416
Get out there and
attract some customers.

177
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,958
What?!

178
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:24,333
What are the two of you up to?

179
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:26,791
Um, hey! Guys!

180
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:28,791
Nymph, good to see you again.

181
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:31,750
Ikaros told us you'd come
back. We would have missed you

182
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:33,958
if you hadn't. I'm so glad.

183
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:35,458
So welcome back.

184
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:38,166
Yeah, thanks. I guess.

185
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,000
It looks like
you're running a booth.

186
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:42,458
But I honestly don't think any
of this stuff is gonna sell.

187
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:43,833
You don't know that!

188
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:46,583
Oh, come on.
This could be fun.

189
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:49,500
I've always wanted
to try my hand at retail.

190
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:51,916
Hey, Ikaros, let's
you and I run a booth.

191
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:56,083
Come one, come all!
Get your belly's fill of

192
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:58,375
Ikaros' delicious lunches!

193
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:01,291
Our shop is an
enormous success Ikaros.

194
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:03,333
The two of us
make a great combo.

195
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:05,208
If you say so, Sohara.

196
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:08,458
So, uh... All that stuff
you said to me before...

197
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:10,291
You know, about
hating me and all...

198
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:12,291
That's right,
I totally hate you.

199
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:15,458
That's what I thought.

200
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:20,875
There's your
everyday tommygun.

201
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:23,166
Or your Colt
M-Nineteen-Eleven pistol.

202
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:26,333
But of course, they're
all non-working replicas.

203
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:31,625
Aw, dammit. Jerks are
stealin' all of my customers.

204
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:34,125
Well, Sugata not
so much of course.

205
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:37,041
Nymph, you're gonna
have to help me out somehow.

206
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:40,166
I want that DVD
more than anything!

207
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:43,000
I'm not doing anything
else. Guess I'll help.

208
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:44,583
Really... you will?

209
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:47,541
When you get the DVD,
can I watch it too?

210
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,208
I dunno...

211
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:54,291
Tell ya what, instead,
if we make some decent cash,

212
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:56,000
I'll buy you
whatever you want!

213
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:57,833
Whatever I want?

214
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:02,416
S'pose that could work. And
I just gotta help you? Right?

215
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,375
Sure, that sounds easy enough.

216
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:05,875
Thanks a million, Nymph!

217
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:08,416
Y'know, this stuff you're
trying to sell is pretty crappy.

218
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,250
Why don't you open up a
food booth like Alpha did?

219
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:12,916
Like okonomiyaki maybe?

220
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:16,666
Makes sense. People
always like to eat.

221
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:23,250
Great value! Top quality!
This is one unique okonomiyaki!

222
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:25,875
Check it! Tomoki opened
an okonomiyaki booth!

223
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:27,708
I'll take one please,
my good sir.

224
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:32,083
You got it, young lady. Now what
kind would you like exactly?

225
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:35,625
Feast your eyes
upon our glorious menu!

226
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:37,708
Tomo... What the Hell is that?

227
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:41,083
For those who prefer 'em just
right... our standard boobies!

228
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:42,875
For those who like 'em
a little more petite,

229
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:44,291
try our half-egg boobies!

230
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:46,500
And for those with
a love of the enormous,

231
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:49,583
our glorious E-cup
and F-cup boobies!

232
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:56,083
Tomoki, it looks like all the

233
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:58,041
female customers
are ditching you.

234
00:12:58,125 --> 00:12:59,333
Aw, son of a bitch!

235
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:03,541
Why don't you try selling
some kind of idol products?

236
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:05,000
I heard girls like that stuff.

237
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:06,916
Hell yeah! Great idea!

238
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:10,083
Ladies and gents!

239
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:13,458
We've got a killer
special for you all today!

240
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:17,875
It's a Tomoki photo... a Tomoki
fan... And if you buy now,

241
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:19,833
I'll throw in some
Tomoki boxers all for

242
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:23,041
the rock bottom price
of just two hundred yen!

243
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:31,291
No takers? Oh well,
strike three...

244
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:35,291
No choice, time to
resort to my backup plan.

245
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:38,458
Psst. Hey, mister.
Down here, mister.

246
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:42,416
Check these out. Got a pair of
high school girl's panties here.

247
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,958
Special discount. You buy now,
I'll even toss in a free pic

248
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:48,583
of the chick who wears
'em. Whattya say, 'eh?

249
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:50,333
Tomoki...

250
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:58,000
So... Tomoki...
You okay there?

251
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,000
I love you...

252
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:14,833
Die! I'm having
this terrible crappy day

253
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:16,416
but all of you are just

254
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,000
freakin' perfect aren't you?!
You all think you're so cool!

255
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:20,000
So together! Well, up yours!

256
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:23,416
All these cool dudes
all over the place,

257
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,958
and I feel like a chump.

258
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:27,291
They keep taking all the
hot chicks and here I am,

259
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:28,625
alone as always.

260
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:31,166
It sucks, it just sucks.
It's the whole reason

261
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:34,083
I even care
about this dumb DVD.

262
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,500
This is about you wanting
to be popular with the ladies?

263
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:43,125
Maybe... But it's not like
that's ever gonna happen.

264
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:49,666
Poor guy.

265
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:53,833
Here you go.

266
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:55,875
What did you just do to me?

267
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:58,458
I just gave you the gift
of "cool guy jamming."

268
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:02,083
Look over there... It's
already taking effect.

269
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:05,416
Why are those
girls looking at me?

270
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,291
Basically... I used my
jamming system to make all of

271
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:10,750
the women here see
you as their ideal guy.

272
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:12,083
From the looks
of their faces,

273
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:14,291
it sure seems
to be working well.

274
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:19,250
This is the moment I've been
waiting for my whole life!

275
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:23,041
Now I can show 'em what
a real man is made of!

276
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:37,500
Sorry for the wait ladies...
But your number one has arrived.

277
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,541
Tomoki's here.

278
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:47,375
Now... Gimme some
sugar. Who's first?

279
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:49,125
Tomoki!

280
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:51,041
Girls please,
there's enough to share.

281
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:53,500
Why don't we all
enjoy a cocktail first?

282
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:55,250
Oh, sure. I'll have one.

283
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:55,958
Oh, me too!

284
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:57,125
I want a bunch.

285
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:59,458
I'll have a hundred!
Get me drunk, baby!

286
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,916
This is bad. I ended up helping
him out. I'm supposed to be

287
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,500
taking the idiot hostage,
not hooking him up with

288
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:10,666
an endless supply of hot
women. What am I doing here?

289
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,583
Nymph, why're you
just sittin' there?

290
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:14,708
Move that cute
little tail of yours.

291
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:16,375
Bring us some
more drinks would ya?

292
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:17,416
Okay!

293
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:22,375
Who wants Dom Perignon?!
Champagne tower, coming up!

294
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:26,750
Here comes the Tomoki tower!

295
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:29,541
No... What's a Tomoki tower?

296
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:35,250
The wait is over, ladies.

297
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:42,333
Gaze upon my manhood!
This... is the Tomoki Tower!

298
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:47,958
What?

299
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:51,250
What's wrong here ladies?

300
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:53,041
Is there some
kind of problem, or--?

301
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:53,833
You jerk.

302
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:54,958
I hate you.

303
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:02,875
What happened?

304
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:04,625
I switched off the
"cool guy jamming."

305
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:05,958
Why did you do that?!

306
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:08,458
Because I was busy
helping out with your shop.

307
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:10,416
It was too much work
keepin' up with both.

308
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,833
No way.

309
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:15,458
But you have shown
me what it's like to

310
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:19,250
live the dream. And I've
finally got enough money.

311
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I wanna thank
you for this Nymph.

312
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,541
You're actually thanking me?

313
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:31,458
Yes! And now I'm
off to buy that DVD!

314
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:36,375
No. Do not allow yourself to
be led astray. I'm an Angeloid.

315
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:38,833
As long as I have
this chain on my choker,

316
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:42,291
I'm destined never
to disobey my master.

317
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:47,375
Your business venture
is quite popular.

318
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:50,125
Why is it that you're
forcing yourself to lie?

319
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:53,875
Who are you?

320
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:57,250
I am a human.

321
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:00,791
Why did Nymph return?

322
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,083
I do not know anything.

323
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:07,291
You know what it looks like
to me? Looks like you're saying

324
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:08,916
the opposite
of what you mean.

325
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,416
Normal humans lie,
therefore I do also.

326
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,125
I am just like everyone else.

327
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:19,875
Very well, I see. At this
rate, Tomoki's going to

328
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:21,416
end up quite sad.

329
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:29,916
Hey, Tomo! Over here!
Your timing's about perfect.

330
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,541
Why? What's going on?

331
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:33,291
We finally managed
to figure out what

332
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:35,833
Ikaros has been
talking about all day.

333
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:37,875
At some point during
the beginning of the day

334
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:40,791
did you tell Ikaros
she should act more human?

335
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:43,583
Yeah, I dunno. Maybe?

336
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:45,250
Well, she certainly
took it to heart

337
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,416
and has been trying
her hand at lying.

338
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:49,125
You've been lying?

339
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:51,916
Everything you said...
was a lie then?

340
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,583
That means when you were
saying how much you hated me,

341
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:57,708
you were actually telling
me how much you love me!

342
00:18:57,791 --> 00:18:58,750
Correct.

343
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:01,708
Everyone thinks you're
cute, and even though you

344
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:04,000
seem violent, underneath
it all you're actually

345
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:06,083
very nice and quite gentle.

346
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:09,875
So then that other
thing you said...

347
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:12,750
how I'm too
skinny... Wait a sec.

348
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:16,500
Correct. Which means I like
that you're slightly overweight.

349
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:19,500
This also means
there is a New World.

350
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:20,875
Correct.

351
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:23,208
And the Prez is a nice person.

352
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:27,166
I am nice. Right?

353
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,500
Correct?

354
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:32,541
So that's that. It was a lie
when she said she didn't want to

355
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:35,125
be with you anymore.
She simply reversed

356
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:37,250
everything she
was truly feeling.

357
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:39,000
Is he getting
that right, Ikaros?

358
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:40,125
Exactly.

359
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:43,541
Geez, don't scare
me like that again, okay?

360
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:46,625
I thought you were gonna
vanish on me too, like Nymph.

361
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:50,583
I can't believe you were
just saying the opposite

362
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:52,208
of what you meant.

363
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:54,541
You've changed quite a bit.

364
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:58,041
Remember you didn't want
them at all in the beginning.

365
00:19:58,125 --> 00:19:59,916
Ikaros and Nymph, I mean.

366
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:03,083
Well... I still don't want
the trouble. You know me.

367
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:05,041
"Peace and quiet is
the only way to live."

368
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,666
Just admit it already.
If you really want

369
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:10,583
something to change,
just change it.

370
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:20,000
Master, listen. I want
to tell you I'm sorry.

371
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:22,458
I didn't mean to cause
so much trouble today.

372
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:24,875
It's cool. I think
I'm used to it.

373
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:27,541
Well, then. Do you
mind... if I ask you

374
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:29,500
a question
about something?

375
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:34,416
When I tried so hard to lie to
you about my feelings earlier,

376
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,833
it caused me to think about
how I really feel about you.

377
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:40,958
After a while, it
started to bother me.

378
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,791
I need to know what you
really think of me, Master.

379
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:51,708
Since I was little, no one's
ever thought of me as "normal."

380
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:54,875
I was a curious kid. I
wanted adventure in my life.

381
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:57,833
In a way, a large part of
me wanted to be like Sugata.

382
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:01,041
One time, I found something
cool in the mountains,

383
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:03,583
and I took the rest of
my class up to see it.

384
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:05,833
Maybe I shouldn't have...

385
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:08,125
'Cause it was dangerous,
and one of my friends got hurt

386
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:10,041
because I wasn't
paying attention.

387
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:12,416
After that,
nobody wanted to go

388
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,666
up to the mountains
with me anymore.

389
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:17,541
I think it was their parents
who stopped them, something

390
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:20,625
like that, but the
next thing I knew...

391
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:22,791
I was all alone.

392
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:27,958
So that's why, when I thought
about you and Nymph vanishing

393
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:30,791
on me like that,
I guess I just got...

394
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:33,500
Well, it reminded me
of what happened back then.

395
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:52,125
Master. I don't
want to leave you.

396
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:56,000
I want to stay
with you forever.

397
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:01,333
What the Hell are you doing
to me?! I'm trying to talk

398
00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:03,958
all serious about something, and
it's like you're playing some

399
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:06,750
crappy mind game on me!
What the Hell is goin' on

400
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:08,458
in that head of yours?!

401
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:11,750
Everything's back to normal
down here. For now anyway...

402
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:14,708
Hello?! I'm talking to you!

403
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:52,166
"The Age of Warring
Boobs: G-Cup Rebellion."

404
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:54,541
Tooth-and-Nail.
Breast-to-Breast.

405
00:23:54,625 --> 00:23:56,500
They're using those
suckers like weapons!

406
00:23:56,583 --> 00:23:58,541
You two have any
idea what time it--

407
00:24:00,708 --> 00:24:02,541
What'd I tell you
about watching that?!

408
00:24:04,458 --> 00:24:07,500
Next time... "Where the
Melodious Words of An Angel Go."
