1
00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:32,791
My name is Tomoki Sakurai.
I'm just your average student

2
00:00:32,875 --> 00:00:35,916
who enjoys his peace and quiet
more than anything in the world.

3
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:37,833
But my best friend
is this chick with

4
00:00:37,916 --> 00:00:40,041
a vicious karate chop
who's always out to get me...

5
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,500
My freakboy classmate
thinks he can fly...

6
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:44,291
And if that wasn't enough,
I'm getting bombarded with

7
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:46,375
S.O.S. messages in my dreams.

8
00:00:46,458 --> 00:00:49,541
Oh, and last but certainly
not least, I've got Ikaros,

9
00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:52,083
some alien chick
who fell out of the sky.

10
00:00:52,958 --> 00:00:55,000
The following story
depicts the downfall of

11
00:00:55,083 --> 00:00:57,166
my peaceful, quiet little life.

12
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:35,041
It's good to see all of you.
My name is Eishirou Sugata.

13
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:37,666
And this here is
my assistant, Pretty.

14
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:40,083
I'm sure you know
this but if you don't,

15
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:41,666
consider this a refresher.

16
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,250
The earth has magnetic lines
that run between its northern

17
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:46,916
and southern axes,
creating magnetic fields.

18
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,750
If this black hole
of sorts is causing the

19
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:50,750
fields to become
disturbed, well...

20
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:52,708
Here's an example.
Migratory birds use

21
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:55,958
these fields to travel. It
helps them determine direction.

22
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:58,250
Any abnormality in this
field will cause the bird to

23
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:00,875
lose sight of its destination
and plummet from the sky.

24
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:03,333
So if this is what's going
on then it's possible for

25
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:06,625
something now to be able to
fly when before it could not.

26
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:09,625
There is a reason for
everything in this universe.

27
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:15,041
Basically, anything that flies
has a reason to be flying.

28
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:17,958
What's important...
is who flies first.

29
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:24,958
That's bad. I'll
mark that as a fail.

30
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:40,791
I can't take it if these
suckers get any bigger.

31
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:53,750
Tomo! Good morning!

32
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:58,291
For crying out loud,
is he still asleep?

33
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:02,458
Tomoki. Get your lazy butt
outta bed. You're gonna...

34
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:07,541
S-Sohara! I-It's not
what it looks like, I swear!

35
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:09,958
I'm just trying to get
this stupid chain off. Look!

36
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:16,166
No! No! No! No! No!

37
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,750
What the hell is this?!
Why the hell is there a chick

38
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,250
with wings in your room?

39
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:22,208
Well, um, she's, uh...

40
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:30,041
She just, like,
fell outta the sky.

41
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,375
Do I look brain dead to you?

42
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:36,625
There's no way I'd believe
a load of bunk like that.

43
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:38,875
Why not? It's the truth!
Look at her, Sohara!

44
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:41,291
Would you freakin'
look? She's flying!

45
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:45,541
See? See? Huh? Huh? Right?

46
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:49,000
Don't go!

47
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:56,000
Sohara!

48
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,166
Ah! Forget that chick...

49
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,833
I still gotta do somethin'
'bout this heavy ass chain.

50
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:04,541
I can extend it
as far as you need.

51
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:07,500
Or if you would prefer,
I can remove it altogether.

52
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:10,125
Why don't you fill me
in on this stuff sooner?!

53
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:11,791
Alright, I'm outta here!

54
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:13,000
Yes, Master.

55
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:21,041
Sohara!

56
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:23,625
Would you at
least hear me out?

57
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:32,291
What are you doing? Don't
follow me, Ikaros! C'mere!

58
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,625
Really? This is
wonderful, Tomoki.

59
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:39,625
I mean, she's obviously an
inhabitant of the New World.

60
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:41,416
And how'd you
figure that out?!

61
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,625
If I remember what Sohara
told me, you're currently

62
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:44,833
living alone because
your parents are

63
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:46,916
touring the countryside.
Isn't that correct?

64
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,583
Uh, yeah, that's right.

65
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:51,000
Perfect. Then you can keep
an eye on her until we work out

66
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:53,958
the details. This is all
for the sake of the New World.

67
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:57,000
You're sure you're gonna
be okay with this, Tomoki?

68
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:59,208
You start living
with a cute girl like her,

69
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:01,750
don't you think one thing
might just lead to another?

70
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:03,250
Like what exactly?

71
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:05,958
Oh, I don't know. Maybe
accidentally tossing her

72
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:07,708
onto your bed and
then your childhood friend

73
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:09,333
sees you
rolling around with her,

74
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:12,000
which rings in the start
of a seedy love triangle?

75
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:14,125
Have you... been watching us?

76
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:16,916
Just a woman's intuition.
But you know women get

77
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,208
way freaked out
when they're jealous.

78
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:22,208
Hopefully the bloodshed
will stay to a minimum.

79
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:25,708
Jeez! Don't jack
with my head like that!

80
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,583
Hey. Ikaros, I need you to go
home and look after the house.

81
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:34,541
I'm gonna stay
here for a while.

82
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:36,875
Master, you should take this.

83
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:38,666
Yeah. What is it?

84
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:41,708
It's a card like the
others, just an older model.

85
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:44,083
Seeing as those
others are all gone now.

86
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:46,166
Yeah. Another card. Whatever.

87
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,875
But Master,
you need to know--

88
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:50,958
It's cool. I got it. Now, when
you leave here go straight home.

89
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:52,916
No stopping on
the way, all right?

90
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,166
All right, Master.

91
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:57,958
What we're really
looking at here is what...

92
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:00,083
Man, now this is the life.

93
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:02,333
Peace and quiet
really is the best.

94
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:04,333
Being able to enjoy
the slightest bit of it

95
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:06,666
is pretty great. 'Specially
with all the crap that's

96
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,583
happened in
the past few days.

97
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:11,375
Oh yeah, I forgot.
She gave me that old card.

98
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:15,083
But I'm not gonna use it.
That's way, way too dangerous.

99
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:19,666
I've learned my lesson after
the recent disasters. Um...

100
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:23,166
But I gotta say... It'd
be pretty sweet to have

101
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,833
some kinda
pervy superpower.

102
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:31,958
Hey, Tomo, you wanna
go eat outside with me?

103
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:33,541
I brought along
a lunch for you too,

104
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:34,875
'cause I'm
awesome like that.

105
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:37,083
Thanks, Sohara.
I appreciate it.

106
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:39,916
Now, uh... About
that girl of yours.

107
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,625
Oh, you mean Ikaros?

108
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:44,083
You're really gonna
let her live with you?

109
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:46,000
I'm just kinda
playing it by ear.

110
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:47,083
All right.

111
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:49,916
Wait a minute. You're not
pissed at me are you?

112
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,583
No, I guess I really can't be.
You've already made up your

113
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:55,125
mind about the whole thing, so
it's not like I can change it.

114
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,083
Well you still
seem pretty ticked.

115
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:59,083
And I told you I wasn't!

116
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:01,541
Hey. Watch where you're
walkin' or you're gonna--

117
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:05,875
Yeah. I tried to warn...

118
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:10,333
You saw.

119
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:12,000
No, no I didn't.

120
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:15,583
Was that a picture of a dog?
It's not like Sohara's in

121
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:18,500
elementary school anymore.
I wish she'd wear something

122
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:21,000
a bit more...
grown up or something.

123
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:27,833
You gotta be kidding!

124
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:32,000
Dude! Those are panties!
Flying freakin' panties!

125
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:35,791
Hang on, those
look... familiar... Oh.

126
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:40,208
Tomoki, why the Hell
is your pocket glowing?

127
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:42,958
No way!

128
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:49,375
The card. It did this!

129
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:57,500
Such a moron!

130
00:08:58,083 --> 00:09:00,666
If you'd stop and think for
a second. I didn't do anything.

131
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,833
The card acted all on its own.

132
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,625
Your BS explanations can wait.

133
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:06,166
I have to find some
underwear to put on, fast.

134
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:17,583
Sugata! Mind if I borrow
your room for a little bit?

135
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:20,208
Wanna fill me in?

136
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:23,500
This whole day is balls
thanks to this stupid-ass card.

137
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:24,500
What?

138
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:28,208
This is so screwed up.
What the Hell is going on?

139
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:29,750
I know Tomo's
always been a pervert,

140
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:31,208
but this is off the deep end.

141
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,250
Are you all right? Sohara!

142
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:48,333
This doesn't look good.

143
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:57,583
This is screwed. Why
the Hell is this happening?

144
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:05,750
Doesn't matter what
she puts on her bottom half,

145
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:07,666
they all just fly away.

146
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,750
Interesting. And
this card seems to be

147
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:11,666
the culprit behind
the sordid affair.

148
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,583
What the hell, Tomoki?
Why can't you put an end

149
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:15,250
to this screwed up fantasy?

150
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:17,500
I'm doing what I can.

151
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,333
Why don't you
try putting this on?

152
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:20,833
'Kay, but what is that?

153
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:21,833
It's a mawashi.

154
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:23,125
Why would she wear that?

155
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:25,125
Please tell me
that's not yours?

156
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:29,833
I have almost everything
you would want in this room.

157
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:31,125
And since you're
playing dress up,

158
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:33,208
you might as well try it all.

159
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:40,041
Red bikini bottoms.

160
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:42,041
Fishnet stockings.

161
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:43,791
Medical gauze.

162
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:47,833
I understood the other things,
but the gauze was just weird.

163
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:50,041
It doesn't look like
anything seems to be working,

164
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:52,250
and it's not limited
to undergarments, either.

165
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:54,916
She looks like she's
having a real tough time.

166
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,916
And whose big damn
fault do you think that is?!

167
00:10:58,666 --> 00:11:01,041
I'm sorry, alright!
Don't freak out!

168
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:04,708
I have a feeling
Master is in danger.

169
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,750
Looks like my gym
shorts didn't work either.

170
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,208
I don't wanna play anymore.

171
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:15,250
Gosh, Sohara. What if
you can't ever wear panties

172
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:17,000
for the rest of your life?

173
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:21,291
Wow. You're giving that
an awful lot of thought.

174
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:22,791
I'm not thinkin'
about anything!

175
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:25,250
I didn't realize you
were into fetish-y stuff.

176
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:28,208
So is all this going according
to your dastardly plan?

177
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:29,958
I don't have any plan!

178
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:32,500
We can't rule out
that possibility, though.

179
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:34,458
If this card grants
unconscious wishes,

180
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:37,083
it could have read your thoughts
and did what you wanted.

181
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:39,458
So let's run an experiment.
What do you say?

182
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:42,416
Try using this card to
wish for something else?

183
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,166
Yeah, alright.

184
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:52,291
Handcuffs?

185
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:53,625
Are you kidding?

186
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:54,875
I get it!

187
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:58,375
What are you doing?

188
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:00,833
What the hell?!

189
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:02,750
Oh, just somethin' I've
always wanted to try on you.

190
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:04,541
Tomoki...

191
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:06,583
You listen. I'm
not wearing anything

192
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:08,000
under my skirt right now.

193
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:10,208
And if the wind blows
through here, can you tell me

194
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:13,541
how you expect me to
hold my skirt down? Can you?

195
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:24,750
Are you in danger, Master?

196
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:27,125
Nice save.

197
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:30,041
Or not!

198
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:31,500
Master?

199
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:36,833
Panties... I... I need them.
I need panties right now!

200
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:40,333
You need panties, understood.
I will amass all panties

201
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:42,458
within a hundred meter radius.

202
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:44,416
What?!

203
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:47,416
This month I've got four
projects that I...

204
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,458
Mikako. What happened?

205
00:12:57,541 --> 00:13:00,166
She got me.
My panties, they're gone.

206
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:07,500
So warm and moist.

207
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:09,791
Will this be enough
panties for you, Master?

208
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:11,875
Yes! Now please, make it stop!

209
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:21,333
My god, all of our panties.

210
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:23,583
And they're flying.

211
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:36,291
Listen up, sonnyboy.
I want you to

212
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:39,791
heed your old grandpa's words.
When you're huntin' bird,

213
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:43,166
shoot the first one that takes
flight, or you're in trouble.

214
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:45,750
'Cause once the first
one goes, the rest are

215
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:49,500
all gonna follow after.
So make damn sure you

216
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:53,333
shoot down the first one
that gets his ass in the air.

217
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:02,208
Never forget that
piece of advice, kid.

218
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:05,250
First in the air...
shoot his ass.

219
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:18,000
First in the air...
shoot his ass.

220
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:24,000
Ikaros. Could you
explain all of this to us?

221
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:25,750
Is this because of the card?

222
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:29,125
Correct. This card is nothing
more than a teleportation device

223
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:32,666
used to send order requests for
various things to the Synapse.

224
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:35,208
It is an older model
card so it only has the power

225
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,833
to grant the request
for a single wish.

226
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:41,500
In this particular instance,
the card involved managed to

227
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:43,708
forcefully grant
my master's wish.

228
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:46,041
Well, finally. This whole
situation's starting to

229
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:48,125
make sense. Mystery solved.

230
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:50,291
Whadda ya mean
"mystery solved?"

231
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:53,750
Let me explain. Here's the
premise. Tomoki didn't like

232
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:55,666
the panties he saw
when you bent over.

233
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:58,125
For whatever reason,
they weren't his cup of tea.

234
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:01,500
Because of this powerful
emotion, the card activated

235
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:04,166
and forcefully removed the
panties he detested so much,

236
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,916
sending them off into the
ether. Those handcuffs are

237
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
simply another tool
giving him the ability to

238
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:10,666
force you to
do as he wishes.

239
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,375
You've got a hidden
little deviant side there,

240
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:16,833
don't you, Tomoki? My opinion of
you is improving all the time.

241
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,625
It's not me! It's that
freakin' card, I swear!

242
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:20,958
So, you gonna tell
me what I gotta do

243
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:22,541
to make all this crap stop?

244
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:24,458
Now that we know the
cause, the solution should

245
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:26,916
come rather simply.
All you have to do is

246
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,583
put on the underwear
Tomoki wants you to wear.

247
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,375
We just need to get
Ikaros and Mikako to buy

248
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:34,000
as much underwear
as they can find.

249
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:35,875
Get something sheer.
A girl should always

250
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:37,375
feel kinda sexy, you know.

251
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:40,041
So I got no choice but
to try every single pair on,

252
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:42,875
one by one? I guess
my top priority, though,

253
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:45,000
is to get home
without incident first.

254
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:47,458
You just leave all of that
to me. I've got you covered

255
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:50,583
all the way back to your place.
Nothing's gonna surprise me.

256
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,208
You're kidding me.

257
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:55,833
Looks like someone
upstairs has it in for you.

258
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,916
You'll be able to see up
my skirt in the reflection.

259
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,541
Don't worry, I'm on it! My brain
has a genius plan! Raleigh Flop!

260
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:10,166
You might wanna
flip over, genius.

261
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,541
Raleigh Flip!

262
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:19,541
Tomo, whatever you do
just make sure my skirt

263
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:22,125
doesn't fly up or
I'll have to kill you!

264
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:26,250
Atomic Manners... ho!

265
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:31,208
Here we go!
Gentleman Speed Kick!

266
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:34,916
Chivalry!

267
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:38,125
Tomoki's getting serious.

268
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:41,750
He's surpassing all his
normal human abilities.

269
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:43,250
I'm back.

270
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,666
We bought panties, Master.

271
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:49,583
Whoa, you got a crap-ton.

272
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:52,041
With this many, I'm sure
we found at least one that's

273
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:55,125
going to suit Tomoki's
tastes. Hopefully.

274
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:58,208
Well, why don't
we get started?

275
00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:00,291
And I'm gonna need both
of you girls to help me out,

276
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:03,125
if it's cool. I can't
do anything with these on.

277
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:04,000
Sure.

278
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:06,375
We can do this!

279
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:11,041
So, what do you think about
these? They're pretty cute.

280
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:13,416
Tomoki might dig
the whole satin thing.

281
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:17,958
Gotta start somewhere...
Oh... Ikaros, I'm sorry...

282
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:19,541
But can you help me out?

283
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:20,708
Yes, Miss.

284
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:28,083
Here you go.

285
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:32,500
Be careful, Ikaros,
you're tickling me.

286
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:34,125
You're gonna make me go all--

287
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:37,583
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

288
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:40,833
It's fine. I guess I am
the one making you help me out.

289
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:42,750
Hope I'm not making
it too hard on you.

290
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:45,000
No, Miss. It's
no problem at all.

291
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,333
You're a nice
person, you know that?

292
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:55,791
I can't thank
you enough, Ikaros.

293
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:01,500
Well, crap. That didn't work.

294
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:04,541
How about trying on
this frilly pair next?

295
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:05,666
They might be playing up the

296
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,625
innocent vibe too
much, but who knows.

297
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:17,583
What is your
freaking problem, Tomo?!

298
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:20,041
There was a pile of panties
and none of 'em worked!

299
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:21,791
Don't tell me you
want me to go commando

300
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:24,625
for the rest of
my natural life!

301
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:25,708
Pervert...

302
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:27,875
Hey, shut up.
That's not it at all.

303
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:30,250
But you should at least
consider the possibility.

304
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:31,125
Which is?

305
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:33,041
Living life without panties!

306
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:37,208
Pardon me, Miss Sohara.
I found one more pair

307
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:39,250
obscured under the bag.

308
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:41,958
No way those'll work. They're
practically the same pair

309
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:44,625
that started this
whole godawful disaster.

310
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:46,750
I see.

311
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:49,208
But I might as
well give it a shot.

312
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:51,125
What have I
got to lose, right?

313
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:00,625
So, uh... those didn't work?

314
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:03,000
I know we just met,
but it was nice knowing you.

315
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:05,583
No you can't
leave me here alone!

316
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,458
No, they worked.

317
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:09,750
They're on! I'm
wearing them right now.

318
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:12,625
And look, the handcuffs came
off, too. Pretty great, huh?

319
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:14,666
Awesome! So
it's finally over?!

320
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:17,791
That's correct. This card shut
itself down without any errors,

321
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:19,625
so everything
should be fine now.

322
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:20,833
Oh thank God.

323
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:24,541
Really that's not very
comforting. You said yourself,

324
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:26,000
"they're pretty much
the same underwear

325
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:28,208
you started this
whole business with."

326
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:30,958
I didn't think about that
yet, but yeah, you're right.

327
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:33,125
Who freakin' cares? In fact,
I don't wanna think about

328
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:35,541
panties for a long, long time.

329
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:37,625
You and me both, Tomo.

330
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:46,083
I'm real sorry
about today, Sohara.

331
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:48,583
Oh, it's cool. Everything
worked out in the end.

332
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:51,541
Yeah, but Ikaros didn't give
me that card to start trouble.

333
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:52,791
In fact, just the opposite.

334
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:55,208
Yeah, I know.
Don't worry about it.

335
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:01,625
So... it uh, looks like
you and Ikaros are gonna be

336
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:04,041
living together
for a while, huh?

337
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:06,416
I guess. It's not
like I can leave her alone.

338
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:10,500
She'd be kinda screwed. And
she's got no place else to go.

339
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:12,125
Plus I feel bad with
her having to walk around

340
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:13,875
with that collar
around her neck.

341
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:15,958
That sounds just like you.

342
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:17,416
How?

343
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,875
You've just always been like
that. When you were little

344
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:21,208
you'd bring home lost dogs.
You'd prattle on 'bout how

345
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:24,250
sad it was they had these
collars, so you'd take 'em off.

346
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:27,541
No matter how long it took to
cut through 'em, you'd do it.

347
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:34,458
That's just part of what makes
you such a sweet person, Tomo.

348
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:35,750
You know?

349
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:36,750
Huh?

350
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:39,166
Uh, forget
about that last part!

351
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:42,083
Speaking of the past, those
dog panties you had on...

352
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:44,291
Guess you haven't
really changed either.

353
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:45,500
What?

354
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:47,958
You don't remember?
How could you forget?

355
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:52,083
Tomo, I can't! No matter
how hard I try! I can't do it!

356
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:54,750
I'm too weak! I can't chop
through something this big!

357
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:56,250
You can't do it
because you don't have

358
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:58,458
enough spirit,
you idiot! Try harder!

359
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:01,333
I'm trying! I'm trying! I'm
trying! I'm trying! I'm trying!

360
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:03,708
Now it's time for
some Spartan training!

361
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:05,500
There!

362
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:08,250
Hey! Check out
the cute puppy dogs.

363
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,791
Gotta love panties
with designs on 'em.

364
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:26,208
And that was the day
you realized what you were

365
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:29,833
capable of. The day your
killer chop first surfaced.

366
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:33,708
So that's what
musta happened to me!

367
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:35,500
That's the day I
stopped liking dogs!

368
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:38,125
It's all flooding back!
Yeah, that makes sense.

369
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:40,875
No wonder I hated
your dog panties so much.

370
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,833
You're saying I had to go
through with that nightmare

371
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:47,458
because of your
stupid childish issues?

372
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:48,666
Huh?

373
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,500
Then all of this was
your fault after all!

374
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:52,833
Tomo, you freaking idiot!

375
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,458
This is News at Eleven. Our
top story. Around the world

376
00:23:40,541 --> 00:23:43,250
extremely rare panty meteor
showers have been reported.

377
00:23:43,333 --> 00:23:45,375
Some experts have
cited abnormal weather for

378
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:47,500
causing this phenomenon,
but many organizations

379
00:23:47,583 --> 00:23:48,916
are still investigating.

380
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,500
Several of these showers
have been spotted here

381
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:52,333
over the skies of New York,
which has brought about

382
00:23:52,416 --> 00:23:54,625
concern that this spectacle
could cause problems.

383
00:23:54,708 --> 00:23:56,041
In response,
cabinet members have been

384
00:23:56,125 --> 00:23:57,833
flooding the White
House. As for now,

385
00:23:57,916 --> 00:23:59,375
the best we can do
is wait and see what our

386
00:23:59,458 --> 00:24:01,083
president and his
supporters plan to do

387
00:24:01,166 --> 00:24:02,875
to combat this growing problem.

388
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:06,833
Next time...
"Angeloid Directive Zero"
