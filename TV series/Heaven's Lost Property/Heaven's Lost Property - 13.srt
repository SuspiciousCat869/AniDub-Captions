1
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:44,833
Just where do you think
you're running off to, Beta?

2
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:50,291
What was that?

3
00:00:50,875 --> 00:00:52,583
Ikaros. What's the matter?

4
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:53,791
Nothing.

5
00:00:56,333 --> 00:00:57,625
Gamma!

6
00:00:57,708 --> 00:01:01,000
You got it. We're the
Angeloid Interceptors,

7
00:01:01,083 --> 00:01:03,291
type Gamma and type Harpy.

8
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:05,583
It's the Uranus
Queen's swan song.

9
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:07,833
We're here to
take the bitch down.

10
00:01:11,583 --> 00:01:13,291
Don't you
worry about a thing.

11
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:16,333
You see, Master
asked us to do this.

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,291
I'll bet you didn't know
he's been watching over you

13
00:01:19,375 --> 00:01:23,291
this entire time. Actually, he's
been quite worried about you.

14
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:25,291
He's worried about me?

15
00:01:25,375 --> 00:01:28,000
Well, he did tell you to take
on the Uranus Queen by yourself.

16
00:01:28,083 --> 00:01:29,958
And that's a Hell of
a tall order for anyone,

17
00:01:30,041 --> 00:01:31,375
even one of us.

18
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:33,500
When he realized you
might get hurt attempting it,

19
00:01:33,583 --> 00:01:35,958
he acted quickly to mount
a rescue. He sent us here to

20
00:01:36,041 --> 00:01:38,166
bring you home
as soon as possible.

21
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:41,583
Sounds like Master's
pretty lonely without you

22
00:01:41,666 --> 00:01:43,375
up there with him, Beta.

23
00:01:44,625 --> 00:01:47,625
Master's worried about me.
And he's actually lonely

24
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:51,500
without me too?
I never expected that.

25
00:01:57,958 --> 00:02:00,875
As much as she enjoys
hanging around those insects,

26
00:02:00,958 --> 00:02:03,125
this must be torturing her.

27
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,000
She'll destroy the Uranus
Queen, kill the humans,

28
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:09,958
and then return to me filled
with joy, certain I'm going to

29
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:13,291
applaud what a good job
she did. And that's the moment

30
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:15,541
I'll tell the wretched thing,

31
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:19,583
"It's time to send
your ass to the scrapyard."

32
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:22,083
I can't wait to see the
horrified face she makes

33
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:24,541
when I drop
that bomb on her.

34
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:40,041
There is no more time.

35
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:45,583
Hear me. You must
save the angel, please.

36
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:48,625
She is being held by the sky.

37
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:58,750
That same
weird-ass dream again.

38
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:02,333
Are you finally
waking up, Master?

39
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:05,875
Yeah. Where's Nymph?

40
00:03:05,958 --> 00:03:07,125
Well, she's...

41
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:10,166
What?! Are you serious?

42
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,333
Nymph pulled another
disappearing act?!

43
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:15,291
Correct. This is becoming
something of a pattern.

44
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:17,958
She's makin' me
crazy! What's her deal?

45
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:20,083
Like Ikaros said,
she's always takin' off.

46
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:22,625
Come on, you have to
have some idea why, Tomoki.

47
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:24,166
Did you do
something bad to her?

48
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,500
It wouldn't be the first
time you did something dumb.

49
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:31,708
What are you--?!

50
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:34,708
Whoa! No! I didn't do anything
wrong, okay? We're cool.

51
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:37,041
You sure? Cuz the
look on your face says

52
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:39,750
the exact opposite of the
words coming out of your mouth.

53
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:42,208
Stop reading into it, it's
nothing! Leave me alone!

54
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:44,541
Come to think of it,
I did see Nymph flying toward

55
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:47,416
the forest last night. At the
time it didn't seem that odd.

56
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,708
You mean it?

57
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:50,333
But now that I think
back, she might have been

58
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:53,250
fretting over something.
Or I could be wrong.

59
00:03:57,541 --> 00:04:00,125
Well, maybe we should
go out and look for her.

60
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:04,000
Don't you think? She can't miss
our Christmas party tonight!

61
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:08,250
I'm not worried about it,
she came back last time

62
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:11,625
she did this. Let's just
focus on setting up the party.

63
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:13,291
We'll wait for
her if we have to.

64
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:15,541
Then how about we go
find a tree for this shindig.

65
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:18,500
It's one of the big things we're
missing. And speaking of big,

66
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:21,375
I have to say I am
partial to the large ones.

67
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:23,708
You got any idea where
we can find a big one?

68
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:26,291
I actually know of an
excellent spot to look.

69
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:29,208
There's an ideal tree near
the riverbed next to my place.

70
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:32,041
That's great. But do you have
something to chop it down with?

71
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:35,083
I'm just saying if you don't,
you could always borrow my axe.

72
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:38,458
No problem there. I have the
perfect axe for chopping wood.

73
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:39,916
I'll leave the
rest o' this to you.

74
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,708
See you in a little bit.

75
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:45,666
That's amazing! You're fast!

76
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:55,416
No, wait! Stop! Ikaros,
you're whipping too fast now!

77
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,041
You have to stop it!

78
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:58,166
All right.

79
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:02,500
Aw, man. You charred the bowl.

80
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:03,833
I have failed.

81
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:08,208
Ah, no worries! We're
still having fun, right?

82
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:10,416
Just us girls,
making a cake together,

83
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,791
finally having
some bonding time.

84
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:16,541
I just wish Nymph could be
here to enjoy it all with us.

85
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,833
What is that?

86
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:24,583
Oh, yeah. I brought it
thinking we could use some of

87
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:26,916
these pictures to
decorate for the party.

88
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,916
Brings back some fun memories,
huh? We've done so much

89
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,333
in the short amount of
time we've known each other.

90
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:38,458
Heh. Yeah, but this one
right here is my favorite

91
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:42,708
of the bunch. When we first
met, I never imagined you and I

92
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:45,083
would hit it off
as well as we have.

93
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:47,916
But I'm glad we did.

94
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,791
Perfect. Seems the information
you gave us was accurate.

95
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:06,750
This is an excellent location.
No place for her to hide.

96
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:09,166
And we've got a
great vantage point.

97
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:16,041
We shall be
proceeding as planned.

98
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,500
Starting from here on out, we're
going to need you to hide us

99
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:21,333
with your P-Stealth system.
That's our best angle of attack.

100
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:23,833
Don't worry. When you
need help, we'll back you up.

101
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:25,250
Back me up?

102
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:28,208
That's right. With
our super-hot compressed

103
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:31,666
projectile cannon, Prometheus.
It fires vaporized matter

104
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,500
heated to three
thousand degrees Celsius

105
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:35,458
at four kilometers a second.

106
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,083
If she doesn't have the time to
deploy Aegis, the Uranus Queen

107
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:41,708
will be no different
than any of us in a battle.

108
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:43,250
We'll get her in one shot.

109
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:45,166
Hold on! I thought the orders
Master gave were for the two

110
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:48,125
of you to bring her back
in one piece, not destroy her!

111
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:49,166
In fact, I thought you were

112
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,250
supposed to talk
her into returning!

113
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:54,458
Well, that's true. But we do
have to protect ourselves if

114
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:55,916
things don't go
according to plan.

115
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,333
Still gotta cover
our asses, don't we?

116
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:01,125
We need you to do everything
you can to keep us from

117
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:03,958
having to use
these dangerous toys.

118
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,458
It'll be fine. I'm
sure you'll be able to do

119
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:11,958
a great job convincing her.
This is just insurance.

120
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:15,291
All that we do here is for
our master. If you succeed,

121
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:19,166
he will have great cause
to rejoice. Don't you think?

122
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:23,291
Master... will be
happy with me then.

123
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:25,958
I understand.

124
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:28,791
But promise me
you won't interfere

125
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:30,916
until I finish
trying to persuade her.

126
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,666
Oh, sure.

127
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,333
Of course we won't.

128
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:49,833
I can't help but wonder what
your true Master would think

129
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:51,875
if he learned what
you were doing here.

130
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:54,833
Little Miss Weapon of Death!

131
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:58,958
What... are you doing?

132
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:03,958
Look, Nymph. The
sky here is so vast.

133
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,708
It's true. Angeloids
aren't designed to smile.

134
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:11,416
Not unless we have humans
around to help us learn.

135
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:16,041
This cage... is
like our chokers.

136
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:20,958
If that's true...
they want out.

137
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,125
Hey, where ya going?

138
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:42,208
I just... need to...
go get something I forgot.

139
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:43,666
Why don't you just
give Tomoki a call?

140
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,125
He's already out picking
up things for the party.

141
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:48,833
Oh, no. I'll just...

142
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:55,125
Ikaros, remember you promised
you wouldn't lie anymore.

143
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:58,208
You don't have to. You're
surrounded by your friends here.

144
00:08:58,291 --> 00:08:59,958
You can talk to
us about anything.

145
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:01,625
You know that, don't you?

146
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:26,291
Anyway... The cake'll
be out of the oven soon,

147
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:28,375
so... hurry back.

148
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,958
Ikaros. Whatcha doin'?
Did you come down here

149
00:09:57,041 --> 00:10:00,083
to pick me up?
Awesome. Perfect timing.

150
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,958
You can help me
carry one of these bags.

151
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:04,500
I got a whole bunch of
stuff. Party poppers. Tinsel.

152
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:06,041
Way more than we need.

153
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:08,708
Master...

154
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:11,000
Oh wait, you're gonna
freak. Check this out.

155
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:14,833
Isn't this hilarious?
Stupid creepy Santa mask.

156
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:18,916
Master...

157
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,791
C'mon, you gotta try
it on. Just for a sec.

158
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,458
That looks kick ass!

159
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:33,000
Goodbye.

160
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,500
Huh?

161
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:39,750
I've come to
tell you goodbye.

162
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:44,333
I know our time together
was short. And I apologize

163
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:46,416
for all the trouble
I've caused you.

164
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:54,333
But, Master, I will never
forget you. I promise...

165
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:59,166
These memories... I'm
going to keep them forever.

166
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:04,291
Wait. What the Hell? Is this
your attempt at making a joke?

167
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:05,708
Look Ikaros...

168
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:12,583
I love you, Master.

169
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:19,041
And I always have.

170
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:23,500
Goodbye.

171
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,083
That had to have been
caused by some kind of

172
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:17,041
attack from the sky.

173
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:21,750
Beginning data scan
of the impact crater.

174
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:24,416
Analysis indicates
Interceptor-Class Angeloids,

175
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,333
type Gamma and type Harpy.

176
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:29,375
That's Nymph's signal.

177
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:36,500
But most likely, I am
their target. I will have to

178
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:40,541
fight them as the weapon
Master hates so much.

179
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,291
I can't go back to him anymore.

180
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:46,333
I won't ever see him again.

181
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:50,333
"Goodbye?!" That's crap!

182
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:52,708
Wow, it's huge!

183
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:55,750
We couldn't find the perfect
tree so we settled on this one.

184
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:57,458
Mikako's heart
was set on a big tree,

185
00:12:57,541 --> 00:12:59,041
so that's
precisely what we got.

186
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:00,666
Is Ikaros here?! Guys?!

187
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:01,583
Tomo?

188
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,416
Dammit!

189
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,041
Wait! Tomo, where
are you going?!

190
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,500
First Ikaros and Nymph
show up out of nowhere

191
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:19,083
and then they just vanish.
Did they even consider the fact

192
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:21,041
that I might be
worried about them?

193
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:22,875
That's why I didn't
want to live with them,

194
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:24,791
cuz I knew I'd get attached.

195
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,166
If they're gone, I
guess at least I'd get

196
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,958
my peace and quiet back.

197
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:32,333
I mean, that's all I
ever really wanted, right?!

198
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:39,666
Hi, Nymph.

199
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:42,333
As I expected, the second I
disabled my stealth functions,

200
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:43,708
you found me.

201
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:46,333
I'm sorry, Alpha.

202
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:49,375
But I had to get you
alone for a minute to talk.

203
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:53,833
I've kept quiet about
it since I showed up,

204
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,166
but the real
reason I'm here

205
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,041
is to take you
back to the sky.

206
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:58,125
Of course.

207
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:04,958
Okay then. So you've known?

208
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:26,750
Why am I even looking for them?

209
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:32,833
Sorry to keep
you waiting. Tomoki.

210
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:35,000
Sugata, why are you here?

211
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,541
You're looking for
Ikaros and Nymph aren't you?

212
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:42,000
According to the eyewitness
reports I've gathered from

213
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:44,541
the area she shouldn't
have gone too far from here.

214
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:48,416
Judging by her direction,
air speed, and abilities,

215
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:52,000
I think it'd be best if we
were to search this area here.

216
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:53,500
But if so...

217
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:55,541
I know exactly what's going
through that brain of yours.

218
00:14:56,416 --> 00:14:57,916
Hop on, I'll give you a pump.

219
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,666
That's not exactly fair.

220
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:04,500
You're running off to do
all the cool stuff without me.

221
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:16,541
Why?

222
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,708
I said why?!
What are you doing?

223
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,875
You said you'd let
me try to convince her!

224
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:25,458
Why did you just attack
her out of nowhere?!

225
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:28,083
Ha. You're such
an idiot. We lied.

226
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:31,916
Idiot or not, she helped us
do this without much effort.

227
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,833
Good point. Guess we
should say thanks, Nymph.

228
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:38,000
We've got a lot on our plate,
appreciate the shortcut.

229
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:40,250
What are you talking
about? What about Master?

230
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:42,958
We're here for one
thing. We need to collect

231
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:46,750
her Uranus system
core. The variable wings.

232
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:49,750
Master asked us to bring
that back and only that.

233
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:52,291
Thanks for taking time
to play with us, Nymph.

234
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:53,500
But you told me--

235
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:56,083
And now we're finished
with you. Get lost.

236
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:02,625
Please. Don't do this.

237
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:05,166
Yeah. This was
just way too easy.

238
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:08,083
Bye-bye, Uranus Queen.

239
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:11,916
Stop it! Tomoki would
never get over this!

240
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,333
Paradise Song!

241
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:22,916
Mikako?

242
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,458
Yeah, what are
you doing here, Prez?

243
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:27,833
You're in a hurry,
and I can help. See?

244
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:39,291
Tomoki wait.

245
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:41,166
No, I want you to stay here.

246
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,916
Not gonna happen!
I'm going with you!

247
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,208
You can't! We're
gonna go to the--

248
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:45,875
Ikaros and Nymph
are my friends too!

249
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:48,125
It doesn't matter
if you like it or not!

250
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:51,541
If you don't take me with
you, I'll karate chop you!

251
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:53,750
And I won't stop
'til you're dead!

252
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:57,041
Sohara.

253
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:04,375
You got ruined!
You're in pieces!

254
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,208
Nymph...

255
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:26,208
Hey. What's with the banner?

256
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:28,000
They were Sohara's idea.

257
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:32,666
Let's see. "Happy
Birthday, Ikaros and Nymph."

258
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:35,208
Do Angeloids
even have birthdays?

259
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:38,250
I dunno. I asked them
and they said they didn't.

260
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:40,375
So I talked about it
with Sugata and Prez,

261
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:42,708
and we decided
to give them one.

262
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:44,625
I suppose it makes
sense for Christmas

263
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:47,041
to be the birthday for angels.

264
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:48,583
Why're you doing all this?

265
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:51,416
Well, Ikaros is still so...
I dunno, she's like a

266
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:55,208
porcelain doll or something.
Never smiling or anything.

267
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:56,541
And Nymph's tries to hide it,

268
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:58,708
but it's obvious
she feels lonely.

269
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:01,291
So we decided to take today's
Christmas party and make it

270
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:04,708
their birthday party too.
Thought it might cheer them up.

271
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:07,541
Oh, and Tomoki,
look at this... Ta-da!

272
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:10,500
A photo album I made with all
the stuff we've done together!

273
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:13,875
Wow, this takes me back. It's
from our camping trip, right?

274
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:17,166
And this one's from our day
at the beach. I look great.

275
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,291
There's pictures from
the cultural festival, too.

276
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:20,833
Here, look.

277
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:23,583
These are really nice shots.
And I'm sure Ikaros and Nymph

278
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:25,416
will smile without
even thinking about it

279
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,291
when they set
their eyes on these.

280
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:30,708
I hope so. I had no idea what to
get for them, so I thought this

281
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:32,875
would at least
be a nice gesture.

282
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:37,833
What's wrong, Tomoki? You don't
look too keen about all this.

283
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:41,708
You do want to do something
nice for them, right?

284
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:45,125
Something to give them
a reason to truly smile.

285
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:47,541
I don't think I can.
All I was ever good at

286
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:49,416
was makin' them cry.

287
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,291
I've sure never made either
one of them smile before.

288
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:54,083
You're like Sohara.

289
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,666
Huh?

290
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:58,833
Even if you can't help, there
must be something you can do.

291
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:02,000
Something only you
can do. That is if you

292
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:04,916
don't want to
regret everything forever.

293
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:14,541
I wonder what kind of
presents they would like.

294
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:16,750
There's gotta be
something I could buy that

295
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:18,208
would make them happy.

296
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:22,916
No way. You took a direct
hit from the Prometheus.

297
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,500
How are you even standing?!

298
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:28,041
I sure don't know.
Why don't you try asking

299
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,333
the two of them directly?

300
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:32,750
Yeah, I think that's
what I'm going to do.

301
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:36,291
But first we
gotta bring 'em home.

302
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:41,083
This... This is terrible.

303
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:43,458
Nymph's wings,
they were beautiful.

304
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:44,875
What happened here?!

305
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:49,583
Variable wing system:
safeties removed.

306
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:53,208
Alpha Stop! Tomoki
will find out, you can't!

307
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:57,083
Activate Mode:
Uranus Queen. Now.

308
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:58,166
Alpha!

309
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:11,291
Master, I'm so sorry.
I have been lying to you

310
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:12,833
from the beginning.

311
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:18,166
I am a strategic Battle Class
Angeloid, type Alpha, Ikaros.

312
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:21,416
I am the weapon
you hate so very much.

313
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:27,958
Yeah, I know.

314
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,791
Ikaros, listen. When I
told you I didn't want you to

315
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:37,583
be a weapon, it's
because I felt bad for you.

316
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:38,958
What?

317
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:43,458
You "adopted" a watermelon and
started raising baby chicks.

318
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:46,833
You have such a kind heart.
The idea that you were created

319
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:50,291
to be a killing machine,
it was just too much.

320
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:52,083
I didn't want that for you.

321
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:54,041
Thank you.

322
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:59,250
But you know, I'll tell you how
I'm looking at it right now.

323
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:02,416
Right now I am more
than happy you're a weapon.

324
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,791
Because now you
can save our friend.

325
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:08,291
Yes, my Master.

326
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:11,750
Ikaros. You have to
save Nymph. Kick their ass!

327
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:13,583
I am Type Alpha... Ikaros.

328
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:15,166
You can do it!

329
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:19,250
Engage targets!

330
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:20,166
Damn it! She's coming!

331
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:20,833
Split up!

332
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:21,625
Right!

333
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:27,000
C'mon, let's use this
chance to break Nymph's chain.

334
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:28,208
Nymph, are you okay?

335
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:29,500
She's doesn't look good.

336
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:30,875
Oh, screw this!

337
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:33,291
I'm sure she has some
loser for a master anyway.

338
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:36,041
No! You don't know
what might happen!

339
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:46,666
You bitch!

340
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:48,500
Die!

341
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:01,833
Now hold still!

342
00:22:05,666 --> 00:22:06,291
Aegis!

343
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:07,666
Just fight through it.

344
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:13,625
Connect.

345
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:27,666
No, that's--!

346
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:30,166
The Uranus... System.

347
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,125
Cerceis.

348
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:51,416
Dammit! You can't cut it
like that, my choker's a bomb.

349
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,791
Once the time limit is up,

350
00:22:52,875 --> 00:22:54,666
they'll send an
ignition code to blow it up.

351
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:57,333
If you cut off the chain
before then, it might explode.

352
00:22:57,416 --> 00:22:59,333
...been twisted
with this axe handle.

353
00:22:59,416 --> 00:23:00,541
Yeah! Let's try it!

354
00:23:00,625 --> 00:23:02,125
Would you people listen
to what I'm saying?!

355
00:23:02,208 --> 00:23:04,541
Everyone in this entire
area could be killed!

356
00:23:04,625 --> 00:23:07,125
It could blow us
all into oblivion!

357
00:23:07,791 --> 00:23:09,208
Yeah, so, what about it?

358
00:23:10,083 --> 00:23:12,750
If you hadn't figured it out
yet, we're your friends, Nymph.

359
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:14,875
And when friends are
in trouble, you help them.

360
00:23:14,958 --> 00:23:17,875
We're just doing
what comes naturally.

361
00:23:21,541 --> 00:23:28,875
Why? Alpha. I don't
understand any of this.

362
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,958
We Angeloids have never
thought about happiness since

363
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:37,291
our inception. This is
just how we were created.

364
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:42,708
We exist for the sole purpose
of making our masters happy.

365
00:23:45,666 --> 00:23:49,666
But now, all of these
feelings I've been having...

366
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:51,750
They're so new.

367
00:24:01,083 --> 00:24:06,625
I'm not sure... But I think...
I might feel happy right now.

368
00:24:10,458 --> 00:24:15,166
Perhaps this is true
happiness I'm experiencing.

369
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:18,708
Alpha? Am I right? Is this it?

370
00:24:35,833 --> 00:24:39,916
Because for the first
time I'm really smiling.

371
00:24:50,375 --> 00:24:53,541
Full retreat of enemy
combatants: Confirmed.

372
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:56,250
Disengage Uranus Queen Mode.

373
00:25:14,125 --> 00:25:16,541
Yo, Ikaros! Check it out!

374
00:25:16,625 --> 00:25:18,291
Yeah!

375
00:25:19,166 --> 00:25:20,875
I'm so glad.

376
00:25:25,875 --> 00:25:28,208
It's gonna be
a white Christmas.

377
00:25:32,791 --> 00:25:36,750
It's beautiful. I see now.

378
00:25:37,416 --> 00:25:41,583
The sky from down
here, it is like Heaven.

379
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:20,208
Merry Christmas! And happy
birthday Ikaros and Nymph!

380
00:28:27,125 --> 00:28:29,458
All right, you two,
I got something to say.

381
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:34,125
I want you to stay here for
as long as you like. So, yeah.

382
00:28:34,208 --> 00:28:35,791
Think of it as my
birthday-slash-Christmas

383
00:28:35,875 --> 00:28:40,583
present to you both. And here.
A little something extra!

384
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:45,791
Tomo! You're always
pulling this cheap-ass crap.

385
00:28:45,875 --> 00:28:47,583
Just like you did with me.

386
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,750
Well whaddaya know.
Nice job, Alpha.

387
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:58,000
Holy crap! You just laughed
a little bit, didn't you?!

388
00:28:58,083 --> 00:28:59,083
Huh?

389
00:28:59,166 --> 00:29:01,375
Do it again! Try
doing it one more time!

390
00:29:04,875 --> 00:29:05,958
Laughing.

391
00:29:06,583 --> 00:29:08,208
You dingbat!
