1
00:01:48,291 --> 00:01:49,666
Okay, let's say
that it is some sort

2
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:51,875
of aftereffect of
the Nirvash's gun.

3
00:01:51,958 --> 00:01:52,958
It's been a whole week.

4
00:01:53,041 --> 00:01:54,500
Shouldn't it have
gone away by now?

5
00:01:54,583 --> 00:01:55,458
The Quartz Gun.

6
00:01:55,541 --> 00:01:56,916
That's what we're calling it.

7
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Catchy, huh?

8
00:01:58,083 --> 00:01:59,375
Hey, Mom.

9
00:01:59,458 --> 00:02:01,250
If you don't mind, can
I point out something else?

10
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:06,708
This light has been
seen in the Arctic Circle

11
00:02:06,791 --> 00:02:08,666
off the coast of Norway's
Vesterçln islands

12
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,958
for hundreds of years.

13
00:02:11,041 --> 00:02:14,500
It's what people call
the North Pole Light.

14
00:02:14,583 --> 00:02:15,916
It's documented.

15
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,083
Even old Viking legends
have made reference to it.

16
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:20,958
That's fascinating,
but what's your point?

17
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:22,541
Nirvash's so-called Quartz Gun.

18
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:23,708
What if, by firing it,

19
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:25,750
Ao affected more
than just the present.

20
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:27,541
But the distant past, as well.

21
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:30,750
That doesn't make any sense.

22
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:32,708
If it had altered the
past in some way,

23
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:33,916
wouldn't we be feeling
the effects of that now,

24
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,541
in the present?

25
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:38,583
Maybe change has occurred,
and we just don't realize it?

26
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:40,083
If you think about it,
how could we?

27
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:42,833
Altering the past would
automatically alter the present,

28
00:02:42,916 --> 00:02:44,500
including all of our memories.

29
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:48,125
There would be no way of
telling what had been changed.

30
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:51,416
Hey Ao!

31
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,291
What are you doing?

32
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:54,875
Oh, hey, Chief!

33
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:56,083
About what you just said.

34
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:58,500
This talk is for
adults, not children!

35
00:02:58,583 --> 00:02:59,500
Don't worry.

36
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:00,625
Everything's fine.

37
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:01,916
I was as shocked as anybody

38
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,791
when the Quartz
transformed itself.

39
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:05,625
But I was impressed
with your quick thinking.

40
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:08,166
Using it as a weapon
was the right call.

41
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,416
Yeah.

42
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:19,041
One more thing.

43
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:21,208
Are we making progress on
quarantining the staff members

44
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:24,750
whose health screenings turned
up anomalies the other day?

45
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:33,416
According to Mom Hannah,

46
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,541
it looks like an increase
in white blood cells.

47
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:37,625
Except their
make-up is different.

48
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:39,000
See that?

49
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:40,916
These x-rays show infestations
of the same material

50
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,083
that comprises Scub Corals.

51
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:44,625
We've known for several decades

52
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:47,583
that Trapar intake can sometimes
trigger allergic reactions.

53
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:50,000
This is a completely
different phenomenon.

54
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:51,458
Since the recent
outbreak of Secrets,

55
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:53,208
there have been similar cases.

56
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:54,583
It's happening
all over the world.

57
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:55,750
Point taken.

58
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:57,625
I'll start by contacting
the US government

59
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:59,750
and the WHO
with our test results.

60
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:01,458
That should do for now.

61
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,916
I believe we'll discover
the first case of this

62
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,750
was that young girl on
Iwato Island in Okinawa.

63
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:17,250
That friend of Ao's?

64
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:20,458
Scub Corals are the enemy
of Earth and all mankind!

65
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:22,916
Trapars invade our
bodies like parasites!

66
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,416
They are trying to destroy us!

67
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,916
Yeah!

68
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,333
Are we going to sit
back and let them...

69
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:29,875
There have been more of
them around than usual lately.

70
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:32,583
Those aren't the normal
Okinawa protestors.

71
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:33,458
What?

72
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:34,625
You mean they didn't come here

73
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:36,416
to demand mineral
rights to the Trapars?

74
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,666
They believe that G-Monsters
are some kind of god

75
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,333
that came to save this world...

76
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:44,083
According to them, Scub
Corals are the root of all evil.

77
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:45,250
Really?

78
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:47,583
The G-Monsters as gods.
That's a new one.

79
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:51,458
Johansson tells us that
Trapars and Scub Coral

80
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,708
are not a natural
part of this world...

81
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:55,541
They do not belong here!

82
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:57,166
Yeah!

83
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:06,916
Stop, its only smoke!

84
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,416
Just a scare tact--!

85
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:22,958
Bastards!

86
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:24,458
They killed him with
their stupid stunt!

87
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:26,333
Damn you, and damn Johansson!

88
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:29,041
What country are those
damn protestors from?

89
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:30,250
They're going to pay for this.

90
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:33,541
What the hell?

91
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:49,833
This is crazy!

92
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:58,000
He's still alive?

93
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,250
I think we've met before.

94
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:10,416
Aren't you Ao's girlfriend?

95
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:20,750
What's going on?

96
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:21,958
Why's there a kid here?

97
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:22,833
Hey!

98
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:24,333
She's that terrorist!

99
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:25,375
Terrorist?

100
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,625
Don't shoot!

101
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:34,125
Please move aside.

102
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:37,416
For your own safety.

103
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:49,250
What's happening?

104
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:51,041
What are you planning to do now?

105
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:52,416
Can't you hear them?

106
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,208
The voices of the Scub Corals.

107
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,250
The Scub Corals
don't belong to anyone,

108
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:02,083
and nor do the Trapars.

109
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:11,958
Okay!

110
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:14,416
Just a quick test shot!

111
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,750
Looking good!

112
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:18,375
But could we get a
smile from you, Fleur?

113
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:20,083
They really are
perfect, aren't they?

114
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:21,916
Absolutely adorable!

115
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,250
Like you just busted
right out of the anime!

116
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,041
Is that really the
best word choice?

117
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:31,500
The fans have no interest
in the three-dimensional.

118
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:34,583
Why not just have Mr. Kanzaki
do some original art?

119
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:37,083
But the two of you
are something special!

120
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:38,958
You're more than just
models for these characters!

121
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:42,041
You're the throbbing heart
of life in the anime's breast!

122
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:42,583
Really, guys!

123
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:44,125
Word choice!

124
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:45,666
I don't care if they do cancel
the show after this season,

125
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:48,333
I will always remain a
devoted Pied Piper fan!

126
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:49,458
Canceled?

127
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:50,375
Really?

128
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:51,916
But why would they do that?

129
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,166
It's still one of the
most downloaded shows.

130
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,500
You check that stuff?

131
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:58,125
Oh, no, no, it's just
a rumor, nothing more.

132
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:00,500
Something about the
sponsors receiving pressure.

133
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:01,666
Pressure for what?

134
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:02,833
You know that whole thing

135
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:04,541
where Gen Bleu kept
the Quartz a secret.

136
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:06,500
Some people have been
saying the anime is propaganda

137
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:09,041
for a terrorist organization.

138
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:22,666
So, you think the
Secret's telling the truth

139
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:25,041
about the Scub Corals
being invaders?

140
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:29,541
Hey there, brat!

141
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:30,833
You're looking pretty
gloomy for someone

142
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:33,125
who just saved the world.

143
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:34,208
I'm not a brat.

144
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:35,708
Of course you are, brat!

145
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:37,083
And, before you ask again,

146
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:39,083
the only IFO teams
at Generation Bleu

147
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:40,833
are Pied Piper and Harlequin.

148
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:43,333
Nobody's ever heard of
these Goldilocks people.

149
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:45,125
I know.

150
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:46,250
I erased them.

151
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:47,458
Huh?

152
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:48,958
It's because of that Quartz Gun.

153
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:50,208
Somehow it made it

154
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:52,750
so that the Scub Coral
in Norway never existed.

155
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:55,500
And the girls, I think maybe
they were never even born--

156
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:56,916
Just stop, already!

157
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,750
You're really
starting to seem crazy.

158
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:06,375
It sounds like something
out of this book.

159
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:08,875
Hey, it's the book
from that one guy.

160
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:14,375
A world in which neither
Scub Corals nor Secrets exist.

161
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:16,750
We believe that such a
world is not a fantasy.

162
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:19,125
But a very real possibility.

163
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:25,250
This Johansson guy.

164
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:27,625
They say that he's some
kind of whack-job prophet.

165
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:30,208
Well, his theory actually has
a decent number of supporters.

166
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:31,833
He claims our world,
our history,

167
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:34,291
really is being
twisted out of shape

168
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:35,958
by the Secrets and Scub Corals.

169
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:39,833
He also believes at least some
governments are aware of this.

170
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:41,291
As for his evidence.

171
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,791
Apparently, he'd
been having visions

172
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:45,291
of "another world"
for a long time.

173
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:47,625
Then ten years ago in
Okinawa, something happened.

174
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:49,708
Okinawa?

175
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:52,833
Following the Burst,
Johansson met a young boy

176
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:54,666
near the stabilized Scub.

177
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:57,708
This boy also knew of the
world's alternate history.

178
00:09:57,791 --> 00:10:02,000
Johansson subsequently adopted
him and recorded his stories.

179
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:04,625
What's different about
this "alternate history"?

180
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:08,083
No let me guess: Germany and
Japan actually won World War II.

181
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:09,333
Nothing like that.

182
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:11,750
Although, his world
is more peaceful.

183
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:12,916
And, without Scub Bursts,

184
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,125
Johansson says Earth
is more prosperous.

185
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:17,625
For example, we can look
at the world's population.

186
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:21,458
In Johansson's history,
it's surpassed seven billion.

187
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:23,166
But the population right now.

188
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,541
Is about three
point five billion.

189
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,750
Due, in part, to that
series of Scub Bursts.

190
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:30,750
The ones that tore their way
through Siberia back in 1908.

191
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:34,375
Severely crippling the Soviet
Union and northern China.

192
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:35,625
And then there was that Burst

193
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:38,000
that took out Japan's
capital after the war.

194
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:41,083
None of these things
happened in the other history.

195
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:43,875
Sounds like it was nothing
but kittens and roses.

196
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:45,416
There are some
other things, too.

197
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,083
Oh, like no Trapars,
for example.

198
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:50,666
Apparently, they use nuclear
fission energy, instead,

199
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,125
and it works pretty well.

200
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:54,625
I've never heard of that.

201
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:56,125
Not surprising.

202
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:58,416
If a Scub Burst occurred at
a nuclear fission facility,

203
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,375
the results would
be catastrophic.

204
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:02,291
So, we gave up developing them.

205
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:05,291
Dude's delusional.

206
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:08,333
He says the alternate
world is the correct one.

207
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:10,375
And that Japanese
intelligence officer,

208
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:12,833
Nakamura, believes it, too.

209
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,625
Okay so, that third
IFO team Ao says he knew.

210
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:19,541
They're part of
this other history?

211
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:30,416
Georg, can you
do a search for me?

212
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:34,666
Chloe McCaffrey,
Maeve McCaffrey and Ireland.

213
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:35,875
Okay.

214
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:37,625
Can we get one with
you two and the new guy?

215
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:38,791
You mean Ao?

216
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:40,541
I didn't know he was
in the show, too.

217
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:41,750
Of course he is.

218
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:44,083
He arrives on the scene,
full of raw talent,

219
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:46,583
inspiring uncertainty and,
perhaps, attraction,

220
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:47,916
in his fellow pilots!

221
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,750
Attraction?

222
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,208
No way!

223
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:51,958
The plot thickens when we
meet Ao's childhood friend.

224
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:54,208
He still cares for her,
but she becomes an enemy pilot.

225
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:56,125
How do they even know
about all that stuff?

226
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:58,083
Cause I'm the one
who supervises the story.

227
00:11:58,166 --> 00:11:58,625
Huh?

228
00:11:58,708 --> 00:11:59,500
It was you?

229
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:02,416
So, if we could just get Ao.

230
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:08,916
Hey, Elena.

231
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,833
The way you've been
acting around Ao lately--?

232
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:12,250
Shh!

233
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:13,833
That's right!

234
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:16,291
Chloe told me the reason they
moved was to work at the plant!

235
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:18,250
This again?

236
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:20,833
Sisters Chloe and Maeve
McCaffrey currently reside

237
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:22,791
in Belfast, Ireland.

238
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,166
As for Maggie Kwan,
there are many people

239
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,083
by that name in the Hong Kong
and Singapore areas.

240
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:27,833
When Nirvash erased the
Scub and changed history,

241
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:30,458
it didn't make it so
they'd never been born.

242
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:34,250
They just never became IFO
pilots with Generation Bleu.

243
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:36,666
Which is in line with
Johansson's prophecy

244
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:40,333
regarding the possibility of
an alternate world history.

245
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:41,625
Interesting.

246
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:45,416
Georg, your voice
sounds kind of different.

247
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,333
An alternate history?

248
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:49,208
More than one possible world?

249
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,083
What's up?

250
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:03,708
It's not like you
to ask for time off.

251
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:04,625
Please!

252
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:06,333
Even just half a day!

253
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:07,541
Tell you what.

254
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:09,583
We'll come along too
and keep an eye on him.

255
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:10,666
Yay!

256
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,833
Vacation! Vacation!

257
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:20,458
Okay. You guys, wait here.

258
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:22,500
What a surprise, huh?

259
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:26,375
I sure didn't know Ao had
a friend in Ireland, did you?

260
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:30,500
Destination reached.

261
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:32,083
The McCaffrey's Bakery.

262
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:38,583
Looks nice.

263
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:40,125
Chloe and Maeve's other life.

264
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:43,458
A life that doesn't involve
piloting IFOs for Gen. Bleu.

265
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:44,958
A life where they never met me.

266
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:46,166
So they're happy.

267
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:47,666
Your logic is flawed.

268
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:50,333
They never met you or became
IFO pilots, but it does not

269
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:53,125
necessarily follow that
they lead happy lives.

270
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:56,500
Okay, girls.

271
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:57,583
If you're done
with your homework,

272
00:13:57,666 --> 00:13:58,875
you can help me out.

273
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:01,416
Well, come along!

274
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,500
Coming!

275
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:06,583
What are you upset about, Ao?

276
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:09,333
You wanted to know the
consequences of your actions.

277
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:10,958
Isn't that why you came here?

278
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:12,958
To learn if you had
made their lives better.

279
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:15,458
Or if they were unhappier now.

280
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:24,333
Ao, I understand what
you're going through.

281
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:26,500
Thought you should know.

282
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,583
Our government did not request

283
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:42,666
Generation Bleu to mobilize.

284
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:45,583
You are not authorized
to be in these waters.

285
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:47,958
Considering it used to be
at the bottom of the ocean,

286
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:50,000
I don't think any country
ever claimed ownership

287
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:51,791
of this Scub Coral.

288
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:53,125
Now that it's active again,

289
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:55,625
it's possible to mine for
Trapars on the surface.

290
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:58,333
Thus, we are asserting
our claim to it.

291
00:14:58,416 --> 00:14:59,958
You feel free to
take up that discussion

292
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:01,000
with your neighbors.

293
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:02,791
But meanwhile,
let us do our job.

294
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:05,375
Its reactivation means a
Burst could occur at any time!

295
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:06,916
So you want us to sit back

296
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,083
while your people collect
the Quartz and hoard it away?

297
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:13,208
Sorry, "move it to
a secure location"!

298
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:18,208
Generation Bleu has been
lying to the entire world!

299
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:20,458
What do you plan to do
if a Secret shows up?

300
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:24,125
Some experts say that the
Secrets have gone extinct.

301
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:25,750
They'll say anything for a buck.

302
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:32,666
Pull out of there.

303
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,375
I've been served with
a summons by the UN,

304
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:36,083
over the whole Quartz issue.

305
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:38,375
They'll be placing
limits on our activities.

306
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:40,041
I can't believe they're
even considering this

307
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:42,500
when there are Scubs
reactivating everywhere!

308
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:53,791
Are we under attack?

309
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:55,833
The Quartz Gun
appears to be restless.

310
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:57,166
What do you mean, "restless"?

311
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,375
If you do not release it,

312
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:01,250
it will most likely
tear the ship to pieces.

313
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:07,291
How can they make it sound like

314
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:09,416
we're the ones who are
endangering the world?

315
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,583
Look out, Fleur!

316
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:27,083
Stop this!

317
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:28,625
You're not authorized
to use the Quartz Gun!

318
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:29,958
Didn't you see?

319
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:34,541
The thing just came flying
at me out of nowhere!

320
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:35,791
What's it doing?

321
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,000
We have warned
you to stand down!

322
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:55,791
It sucked up the
Quartz and swallowed it!

323
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:58,541
This is clearly an
act of provocation!

324
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,000
Damn it! Damn it!

325
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Oh, no!

326
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:29,583
Crazy gun!

327
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:31,000
What's with you?

328
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:35,125
It won't work.

329
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:37,541
This thing is too dangerous
for us to keep using it.

330
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,875
Ahh... Here it is!

331
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:49,166
I've been looking
for this everywhere!

332
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:52,916
Give the gun back, Truth!

333
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:54,541
Now!

334
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:56,125
I thought you didn't want it?

335
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:56,833
Was I wrong?

336
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:58,041
That thing's dangerous.

337
00:17:58,125 --> 00:17:59,125
It's not just a weapon.

338
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:00,750
It can alter the world!

339
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:02,750
Exactly what I'm looking for!

340
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:23,125
I'm dead, crap!

341
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:26,375
Ao.

342
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:33,291
Mama!

343
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:34,000
Oh, my!

344
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:35,458
Look at you.

345
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:37,125
You've gotten so big!

346
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:40,583
Ma, Mom, it's
really you, isn't it?

347
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:43,333
You know me?

348
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:46,708
It's me.

349
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:49,000
You understand
it now, don't you?

350
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:51,708
Why I suddenly disappeared?

351
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:57,791
Ten years ago, you extracted a
giant Quartz from a Scub Coral.

352
00:18:57,875 --> 00:18:59,041
That's right.

353
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:00,833
And, together with the Quartz.

354
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:02,500
I leapt to a different time.

355
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:07,125
But, how is that possible?

356
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:08,375
To the Quartz,

357
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:10,750
there is no difference
between time and space.

358
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:13,541
However, I was
unable to control it.

359
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:16,125
So I've been
haphazardly caught in time,

360
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:18,875
unable to remain in one place.

361
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:21,916
Time passes very differently
for me than for you.

362
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,750
To me, it's only been
a few days since I left.

363
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:28,041
Okay, but the Quartz
ended up coming back, right?

364
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,000
Then, couldn't you
come with me, also?

365
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:32,125
I can't.

366
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:36,375
I'm here with you,

367
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:37,541
but only in this form,

368
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:39,625
and not for very
much longer now.

369
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:40,291
No!

370
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:41,541
I don't accept that!

371
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:42,791
I don't care what you say.

372
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:44,416
I'm getting you back!

373
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,958
I can reach you, can't I?

374
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:47,958
As long as I have the gun!

375
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:49,833
I don't know.

376
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:51,666
That's something Renton, I mean,

377
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,500
your father has
been trying to find

378
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:55,333
for a very long time.

379
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:57,833
But it isn't complete yet.

380
00:19:57,916 --> 00:19:59,500
Then I'll do it!

381
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:02,958
I'll keep the gun and find out
how to complete it somehow.

382
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:04,916
And when it's ready,

383
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,916
I'll find you again,
wherever you are!

384
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,875
I swear it!

385
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:09,916
Nobody will take it from me!

386
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:21,875
Well?

387
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,041
Mom, please.

388
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:36,791
Just tell me!

389
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:38,416
Tell me where you are!

390
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:44,458
Interesting.

391
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:45,541
Go ahead!

392
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:46,791
Take your shot!

393
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:49,333
Shoot, and change
the world for me!

394
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:51,500
You are a child
of the Scub Corals!

395
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,333
And I am Johansson's son.

396
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:55,208
We have no choice but to fight!

397
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:59,791
There's no escaping our destiny!

398
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:01,750
That's not why I'm fighting you.

399
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:02,916
Destiny?

400
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,375
No, that's got
nothing to do with it!

401
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:39,875
The Allied Forces
have come out to play.

402
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:45,875
I can't fire it!

403
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:48,250
It'll just change
something again if I do.

404
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:49,833
I can't risk that.

405
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:52,875
This is Niki Tanaka
of the Allied Forces,

406
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:54,625
stationed at Okinawa.

407
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:56,166
I have an offer.

408
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:59,250
Ao Fukai, we are prepared to
take you under our protection.

409
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:02,375
Protection?

410
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:03,958
It's getting to be too much.

411
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:06,916
Generation Bleu isn't equipped
to handle you anymore.

412
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Surely you can
see that I'm right?

413
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:11,291
Ao, move!

414
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:12,250
We'll open fire.

415
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:12,750
It's okay!

416
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:14,375
Stay back!

417
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:15,875
But why?

418
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:19,541
It's the Allies.

419
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:21,000
The United States
fought right alongside us

420
00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:23,875
during Operation
Polaris, remember?

421
00:22:23,958 --> 00:22:25,500
We can't fire on them!

422
00:22:25,583 --> 00:22:27,208
Not after that.

423
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:38,083
To be continued.

424
00:24:12,791 --> 00:24:15,708
Next time on Eureka Seven AO.

425
00:24:15,791 --> 00:24:17,250
Ao joins the Allied Forces,

426
00:24:17,333 --> 00:24:19,166
bringing the
Quartz Gun with him.

427
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:21,541
Confusion and sadness
follow in the wake

428
00:24:21,625 --> 00:24:23,791
of his unexpected decision.

429
00:24:23,875 --> 00:24:25,291
Will Fleur and Elena be able

430
00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:28,666
to accept the choice their
fellow pilot has made?

431
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:33,750
Eureka Seven AO, Episode 18:
"third engine."

432
00:24:33,833 --> 00:24:35,958
Hear the cry of the
children of the stars.
