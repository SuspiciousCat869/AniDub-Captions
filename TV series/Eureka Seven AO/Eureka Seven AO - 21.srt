1
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:47,083
This feels so strange.

2
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:48,833
Flying alongside Japan.

3
00:01:52,041 --> 00:01:52,958
Pied Piper One.

4
00:01:53,041 --> 00:01:54,208
You good to go?

5
00:01:55,458 --> 00:01:56,250
Yes.

6
00:01:56,333 --> 00:01:58,208
Moving into flight formation.

7
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:20,416
He's got an
excellent visual on me.

8
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,750
Pretty impressive.

9
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:23,083
Sir?

10
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:26,125
Commence mock scenario
against the Allied Forces.

11
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:27,708
Roger that!

12
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:37,166
All looks clear in
the Hitoyoshi area.

13
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,083
Maintain 3000 altitude.

14
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:40,791
How are the fuel reserves?

15
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:42,791
Honestly, things are
looking pretty tight.

16
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:44,916
At this point the number
of sorties we're able

17
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,250
to field will depend
entirely on Han's father.

18
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:48,666
Wonderful.

19
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,833
Another problem
to add to the pile.

20
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:57,500
Nearing territorial waters.

21
00:02:57,583 --> 00:02:59,250
Halt all ships!

22
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:00,833
Full reverse at once!

23
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:08,666
Warning.

24
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:11,791
Your ships are about to violate
Japan's territorial waters.

25
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:13,791
Please withdraw immediately.

26
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:22,041
This is Fleur Blanc.

27
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:23,708
She's officially
taken over leadership

28
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:27,000
of our company as
representative director.

29
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:29,083
It will come as no surprise
that the Allied Forces,

30
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:32,708
have again demanded that
we hand over Pied Piper.

31
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:35,708
And we have once again refused.

32
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:37,541
Thank you very much.

33
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:40,541
All right, now let's see to
hashing out the various details.

34
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:42,833
First, RA-301
regarding candidates

35
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:44,333
for the pilot of the Kyrie.

36
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:48,333
Yes.

37
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:50,166
Please let me
look over the list.

38
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:53,791
As of four-thirty p.m., the
special alert has been lifted.

39
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:55,958
The Allied Forces fleet
on the verge of violating

40
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:58,291
our territorial waters
heeded our warnings

41
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:00,000
and retreated to
international waters.

42
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:00,916
It's hard to remember now.

43
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,500
Was Okinawa like this, too?

44
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:04,750
Always on edge with
the rest of the world?

45
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:05,583
Yeah, I guess.

46
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:06,666
Good work in there.

47
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,541
You were very composed.

48
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:10,000
We might want to
take this suit in

49
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,375
a little in the back, though.

50
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:12,750
You think?

51
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:15,583
It used to be Rebecka's,
and Fleur can't quite fill--

52
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:17,666
Wanna grab something to eat?

53
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:21,041
My treat, of course, Miss CEO.

54
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:23,166
I just want to go
back to the hotel.

55
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,500
I have work to do there.

56
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:27,250
You guys go ahead and
have a good time, though.

57
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:29,208
Wait up, Fleur!

58
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:31,458
I'll be your bodyguard.

59
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:34,208
Maybe she's made peace
with her dad's death.

60
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:36,791
She is putting on a brave
face, but I doubt it.

61
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:39,375
So, what about the Elena issue?

62
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:41,666
Elena Peoples is
currently stationed

63
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,500
at the Allies' base in Guam.

64
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,166
Her betrayal of us is looking

65
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,416
more and more
real by the second.

66
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:49,250
Well.

67
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:50,083
Ivica and the others
should know.

68
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:51,375
Do you want me to tell them?

69
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:52,583
No, don't.

70
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:54,583
I would rather take
care of it by myself.

71
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:28,875
I can't breathe!

72
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:32,916
Everyone here is a
little on the old side.

73
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,875
They're IFO pilots?

74
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:37,416
I have heard Americans
tend to age more quickly,

75
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,333
so maybe that's it.

76
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:41,416
Actually, they're
all Coral Carriers.

77
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,416
This is the only unit in the
Allied Forces

78
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,291
to which Carriers
have been assigned.

79
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:46,750
That's enough.

80
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:51,875
It's the fruit of a
long-term research project

81
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:53,666
at Big Blue World.

82
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:56,000
We now know that Coral
Carriers have a high aptitude

83
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:59,416
for piloting IFOs,
even as adults.

84
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,250
Just me.

85
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:13,333
I'm the bad-ass loner that's in
every high school clique story!

86
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:17,416
Hi. I'm Maggie Kwan.

87
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,916
We girls should stick
together, don't you think?

88
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:23,250
Are you one of the
Coral Carriers, too?

89
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:24,541
No, of course not.

90
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:26,208
I'm younger than they are.

91
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:28,000
I grew up in Hong Kong,
you know, and we have

92
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:30,833
a Coral Plant located nearby
in the South China Sea.

93
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:33,541
I've been breathing Trapars
ever since I was little.

94
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:35,250
Same as you have.

95
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:40,583
So, what are Coral
Carriers, anyway?

96
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,791
Coral Carrier is the
term we use for somebody

97
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:46,083
who has parasitic Scub Corals
living inside their body.

98
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:49,666
At first the story was that
it was just an illness, but--

99
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:54,291
There's speculation that
it's actually the result

100
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:56,291
of a joint experiment
with Big Blue World

101
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:59,125
to artificially implant
Scubs into people.

102
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:03,250
Don't be shy.

103
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:04,375
You're a growing boy.

104
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:05,541
Order whatever you want.

105
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:06,916
Sky's the limit!

106
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,833
Right.

107
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:13,291
Yeah, This restaurant's a
regular haunt for pilots.

108
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:14,333
We love it.

109
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:15,500
You've been
living abroad, though,

110
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:17,000
so it might not be
what you're looking for.

111
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:27,250
No, really, this is perfect.

112
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:29,916
Everything's delicious so far!

113
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:32,708
Well, then,
give this a try, too.

114
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:39,875
So have you had any problems
with the new board, thus far?

115
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:41,416
No, it works great.

116
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,333
My guess is it's from the
research they were doing

117
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:45,666
when they thought they
were getting the Mark I.

118
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,500
The manufacturer
apparently has all kinds

119
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:49,708
of other equipment they
want you to try out.

120
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,333
Oh, that's right.

121
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:56,250
There're no FPs here, are there?

122
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:59,875
No, but we get along pretty
well without them, you'll see.

123
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:15,791
Where'd you get those?
They're really cute!

124
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:17,083
Can I have some?

125
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:20,625
Okay, I'm off to work now.

126
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:21,833
Naru dear.

127
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:22,833
I've been wondering.

128
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:25,041
What is you do
at work every day?

129
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:26,250
Lots of stuff.

130
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:27,708
We have discussions.

131
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:30,666
About the future of
the world, for example.

132
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,458
Sometimes we sing
with the Scub Corals.

133
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:37,250
Do the Scubs really sing, Daddy?

134
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:45,250
Coral Carriers, huh?

135
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:46,500
These last few months,

136
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:48,541
we've seen an explosion
in the number of cases.

137
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:50,500
There's a particularly
high concentration

138
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:52,958
of patients here in
the Okinawa region.

139
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:54,500
From what our analysis tells us,

140
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:58,500
Naru, you appear to be
the first one afflicted.

141
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:00,708
Interestingly, we've
noticed that many

142
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:03,791
of the patients seem to be
gathering on Iwato Island.

143
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:05,125
Right here.

144
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:06,916
In your vicinity.

145
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,375
What's your point?

146
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:11,458
You're looking at me like
I'm some kind of alien.

147
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,916
We're not really any different
than other people, you know.

148
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,958
Not at heart.

149
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:20,583
No more Coral plants!
No more Coral plants!

150
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:22,333
Let the Scubs be free!

151
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:25,000
Let the Scubs be free!

152
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:27,333
The Scub Corals are our friends!

153
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:30,416
The Scub Corals are our friends!

154
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,708
No more Coral plants!

155
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:32,833
What's next?

156
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:33,916
What will you demand
once you've forced

157
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,166
the Coral plant to shut down?

158
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,416
All we want is for the Scubs

159
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,916
to be allowed to remain
in their natural state.

160
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,541
If we do that,
the Trapars will fill

161
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:43,833
this planet's atmosphere
on their own.

162
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:44,375
Hey, Naru!

163
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:45,875
You're late!

164
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:04,125
So, the Allies cut you off,

165
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:06,541
and you've been forced to
turn to our lowly country.

166
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:07,625
Yeah.

167
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:08,875
Well, here's a
friendly warning for ya.

168
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:11,583
They're just gonna take
advantage of you, too.

169
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:12,416
The smell.

170
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,041
The whole bar must be empty.

171
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:15,125
Take it easy.

172
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:16,250
Hey, what are
you looking at man?

173
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:17,625
Nakamura!

174
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:18,916
I think you've had enough.

175
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,916
Oh, yeah?!

176
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,333
You think you can
order me around

177
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:23,083
'cause of where you were born?

178
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:26,166
I'm a respectable
Japanese citizen, too!

179
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,916
Independence.

180
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,333
My old man and my grampa, hah!

181
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:32,583
Those stupid old men!

182
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:34,750
They called this place
their home, you know!

183
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:35,625
Yeah!

184
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:36,833
But then the Trapar boom came,

185
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:39,458
and they went back
to Naha, just like that!

186
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:41,375
I'll have you know.

187
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:42,500
So you're Okinawan?

188
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:43,875
I'm Japanese!

189
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:46,208
And I'm gonna make this
country a number one power!

190
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:47,208
Yeah.

191
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:48,083
Of course.

192
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:49,291
Number one, I tell ya!

193
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:50,500
You hear me?

194
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:53,250
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

195
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,625
"There is something deeply
wrong with this world."

196
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:12,208
A sentiment Truth liked to
repeat over and over again.

197
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:15,083
I'd thought the same
thing since I was little.

198
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:17,750
I wanted to find a
way to right the wrong.

199
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:20,375
To do that, I had
to join the JAF.

200
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:22,541
But does that justify
Truth's methods?

201
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:27,166
He wants to change the world
by plunging it into chaos.

202
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:47,416
Was that, some kind of vision?

203
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,125
We may have something
else in common.

204
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,666
Could be, you're from
another world, like I am.

205
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:02,750
So, there you have it.

206
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:04,708
There's not much
else to tell, really.

207
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:07,041
I was transported here
from that other world.

208
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:08,625
Where there's a heart
stamped on the moon.

209
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:10,333
That's me in a nutshell.

210
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:13,083
So, basically, you're an
alien from another dimension.

211
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:16,083
Ooh, lookin' at me
like I'm a troll.

212
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:21,458
An LFO?

213
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:25,375
So where?

214
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:26,833
Sorry.

215
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:27,958
Do know Ao?

216
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:29,500
A boy with blue hair?

217
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,458
And the Quartz--
what happened to it?

218
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:35,541
Eurekaaaaa!

219
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:37,958
I finally found you!

220
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:40,083
Now, take me back to my world!

221
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:42,375
Don't you remember me?!

222
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:44,125
Here, look!

223
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:50,083
Oh!

224
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:52,083
Are you that girl
from the other day?

225
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:53,666
You've grown up so much.

226
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:54,833
Not "the other day"!

227
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:56,625
Try five years!

228
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,125
Yes, it's been five years now.

229
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:03,583
Since you abandoned
me in the Caribbean Sea.

230
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:05,291
I had no other choice.

231
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:06,583
If I didn't do something,

232
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:08,458
you would have been
caught up in a Scub Burst.

233
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:10,083
I had to get you out of there.

234
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:11,041
Take me back!

235
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:13,458
I don't belong in this world!

236
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:14,666
I can't do that.

237
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,583
In my current state,
I have no control over

238
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:19,291
when or for how
long I can appear.

239
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:22,208
There's no way for me to return
you to your original time.

240
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:23,583
I'm so sorry.

241
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:26,750
What do mean original time?

242
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:28,291
Answer me!

243
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:30,625
Where I come from, there's
a heart mark on the moon.

244
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:32,708
It's a completely
different place than this!

245
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:33,708
A heart?

246
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:35,041
You saw that?

247
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:37,041
I still think you're mistaken.

248
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:39,458
This is the world
I saved you from.

249
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:42,541
It was just at an earlier
time, if that makes sense.

250
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:44,125
When you travel through time,

251
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:46,833
you can see my world, which
explains the mark on the moon.

252
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:50,875
How could I have been so wrong?

253
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:52,458
So, where is Ao?

254
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:55,125
Is he fighting against the Scub
Corals, like he's supposed to?

255
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:07,500
Damn you, Eureka!

256
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:10,750
Elena.

257
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:14,750
No, my name isn't Elena.

258
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:16,208
That's not me.

259
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:17,250
I don't belong here.

260
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:19,291
I'm from a different world.

261
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:21,208
A different world.

262
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,750
My wife was born on the
main island of Okinawa.

263
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:49,291
Ten years ago
she took the children

264
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:51,083
to visit the place
where she grew up.

265
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:53,250
I thought the Secret got them.

266
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:55,291
But now I know it was actually

267
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:57,083
because of the Scub Corals.

268
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:59,166
They did it.

269
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,500
So, let's do this.

270
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:03,583
Together, we can rid
the world of them.

271
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:05,208
Can we?

272
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:06,875
Really?

273
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:10,250
I hear that you're resigning.

274
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:12,708
So, what do you plan to do?

275
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:15,500
Yes, what are your
plans, Nakamura?

276
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:18,083
Nothing can change
my ultimate objective:

277
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:20,500
To see Japan as the world's
greatest superpower,

278
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:22,500
with the JAF at the helm.

279
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:23,958
Since coming to this world.

280
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:27,041
I have learned much
about human history.

281
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:27,958
Hitler.

282
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:28,833
Napoleon.

283
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:30,000
Alexander.

284
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:31,416
You are not the first human

285
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,958
to propose the things you
speak of, but in the end--

286
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:35,375
Well, goodbye.

287
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:36,833
Thanks for everything.

288
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:45,041
The year 2020, the Scub Burst

289
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:47,666
that occurred in
the Caribbean Sea.

290
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:52,791
There was another Burst in
the same area, back in 1981.

291
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:55,083
There were many children
who were caught in it.

292
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:57,291
some of whose bodies
were never found.

293
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:04,875
All members of the two-hundred-
and-fourth Special Squadron.

294
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:06,375
A Scub Burst appears
to have occurred

295
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:08,041
in the country of Indonesia.

296
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:09,625
If Eureka is
traveling through time

297
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:13,833
from one Scub Burst to another,
I have to tell Elena about this!

298
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,208
Elena.

299
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:19,875
Elena!

300
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:21,041
Please!

301
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:23,458
Answer me!

302
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:27,000
What the--?

303
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:47,125
The Secrets attacked
one of their own?

304
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:49,416
I don't understand.

305
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,000
The process is automatic.

306
00:16:58,083 --> 00:16:59,458
We cannot stop it.

307
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:01,708
When a Scub appears,
so does a Secret.

308
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:03,250
But we have
resolved the situation,

309
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:05,041
as per our agreement with you.

310
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:08,458
In that case, it seems there's
nothing left for us to do.

311
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:11,625
Ivica, isn't there
something you're forgetting?

312
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:36,875
Done.

313
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:38,375
The Quartz is--

314
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:01,166
The Credo?!

315
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,625
I thought Goldilocks
didn't exist anymore.

316
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,666
It's me, Ao.

317
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:07,333
Elena.

318
00:18:07,416 --> 00:18:09,583
Is it true that you
joined the Allied Forces?

319
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:29,708
Stop that!

320
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:30,708
Quit it, Nirvash!

321
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:31,958
That's Elena!

322
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:33,750
What's that about?

323
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:35,625
A guy high on
life being gracious?

324
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:38,916
Or maybe it's the graciousness
of a real-life chosen one.

325
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,125
Screw youuuuuu!

326
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:49,083
Wait, Elena!

327
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:49,916
Hey, stop it!

328
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,916
What's going on?!

329
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,083
Just like her!

330
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:54,333
Mother and son both
thinking I'm a fool!

331
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:57,125
Had enough?!

332
00:18:57,791 --> 00:18:58,750
Son of Eureka!

333
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:01,541
I'll destroy you!!

334
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:18,208
Don't lock on, damn you!

335
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:19,791
We can't let Ao shoot Elena!

336
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:21,125
Get between them, quick!

337
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,958
Why, Elena?

338
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:31,958
No, you can't!

339
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:38,750
There's no choice.

340
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:39,833
He has to shoot!

341
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:41,791
How could you say that?!

342
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:43,291
We agree.

343
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:44,583
Whatever the cost, the Allied
Forces must not be allowed

344
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:48,916
to have the Quartz Gun
under their control.

345
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:55,166
Please, Elena!

346
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,333
Just listen to me!

347
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:57,500
I checked!

348
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:59,708
I looked into what
that Eureka woman said!

349
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:01,125
It was all true!

350
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:02,208
I know that voice.

351
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:04,833
Is that really you, Maggie?!

352
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:06,166
I figured it out.

353
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:07,416
I know who you are.

354
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,708
Long ago, your name was--

355
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:09,916
No, you're wrong!

356
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,833
It doesn't matter
what you say to me!

357
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:13,541
I'm going home, where I belong.

358
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:15,541
I'm from some place
better than this!

359
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:17,041
This isn't my world!

360
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:18,583
Shut up, you idiot!

361
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:21,208
This is the world you're from,
and you need to accept that!

362
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:22,958
There's no world for
you to go back to!

363
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:24,458
I see.

364
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:26,750
So that's why you were trying
to get me to fire the gun.

365
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:29,666
Elena.

366
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:30,708
Hold on.

367
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:38,708
This is all wrong.

368
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:41,333
I don't accept any of it!

369
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:43,541
That isn't my story!

370
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:45,500
No! This isn't how
it's supposed to be!

371
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:46,958
I'm a chosen one!

372
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:50,166
A mysterious character whose
true identity is unknown!

373
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,583
But like you, Ao, I'm destined

374
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:54,333
to finally return one day
to the world of my birth!

375
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:55,000
Elena.

376
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:55,791
Don't call me Elena!

377
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:57,708
It's all fake!

378
00:20:57,791 --> 00:20:59,083
You're no fake, Elena!

379
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,041
You're still you!

380
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,291
Well?

381
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:06,833
Are you saying it was all a lie?

382
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:08,416
When you fought beside me?

383
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,541
When we were friends?

384
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:10,750
Shut up!

385
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:11,625
Listen!

386
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:14,541
I want to be with you, Elena!

387
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:15,916
Ao.

388
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,208
And Fleur, and the Chief.

389
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:19,416
and Noa!

390
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,291
I'm not leaving you guys.

391
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:23,625
I went looking for
my mother and found you.

392
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:26,750
You're my family now.

393
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:29,083
So, let's go home together.

394
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:33,375
What do you say?

395
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:34,833
Yeah.

396
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:36,458
I know.

397
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:38,541
The things I love.

398
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:41,666
I love them because they
will always be out of reach.

399
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:58,541
In the end, it doesn't matter.

400
00:21:58,625 --> 00:22:02,708
However far I go, I'll
be under the same sky.

401
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:19,375
What's that light?!

402
00:22:19,458 --> 00:22:21,125
It's him!

403
00:22:21,208 --> 00:22:22,083
Truth!

404
00:22:22,166 --> 00:22:25,291
Shoot it! Shoot it!

405
00:22:26,333 --> 00:22:28,083
Shoot it! Shoot it!

406
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:29,291
It'll be easy.

407
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:30,833
Shoot the Gun now.

408
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:32,500
Destroy them.

409
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:35,375
Destroy everything!

410
00:22:36,666 --> 00:22:38,125
To be continued!

411
00:24:12,833 --> 00:24:15,875
Next time on Eureka Seven AO.

412
00:24:15,958 --> 00:24:19,416
Truth appears again, in
an even more dangerous form.

413
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:22,208
The war between him and
Ao has been a long one,

414
00:24:22,291 --> 00:24:24,375
but now their
final battle begins,

415
00:24:24,458 --> 00:24:28,333
and the real story of
Truth will be revealed.

416
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:33,958
Eureka Seven AO, Episode 22:
"coral carriers."

417
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:36,083
Hear the cry of the
children of the stars.
