1
00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:19,250
You're telling me
you're my old man?

2
00:00:24,208 --> 00:00:26,166
C'mon, Chief!
Let me go!

3
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:27,333
I made myself a promise.

4
00:00:27,416 --> 00:00:29,500
That if I ever saw
this guy, I'd punch him!

5
00:00:29,583 --> 00:00:31,000
My name's Ivica Tanovíc.

6
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:32,291
Good to meet you.

7
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:33,666
I know Eureka, as well.

8
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,916
She saved my life once.

9
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:38,250
What's happened to her?

10
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:41,791
Why is she transient,
her body insubstantial?

11
00:00:43,083 --> 00:00:44,875
The anthropic principle.

12
00:00:44,958 --> 00:00:46,666
Have you heard of it before?

13
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:55,166
The theory that
reality is transformed

14
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:57,833
by the desires of
intelligent observers.

15
00:00:57,916 --> 00:01:01,166
It is that concept to
which you are referring?

16
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:04,666
The Scub Corals are a collective
of intelligent beings.

17
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:06,416
They escaped the Limit of
Questions and the collapse

18
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,333
of reality that would result and
acquired the means to travel

19
00:01:09,416 --> 00:01:12,583
from our universe
to another one.

20
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:16,125
It is a substance called Quartz.

21
00:01:16,875 --> 00:01:18,416
You said another universe.

22
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,208
Not the future,
but a different universe?

23
00:01:21,625 --> 00:01:24,291
Eureka's a Coralian,
as I assume you know.

24
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:26,708
That gave her the power
to Quartzify herself,

25
00:01:26,791 --> 00:01:27,958
and she was thus able

26
00:01:28,041 --> 00:01:30,250
to guide the dangerous
Quartz somewhere else.

27
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:32,791
She must not have been specific,

28
00:01:32,875 --> 00:01:36,083
only wishing to go to a time
and place that was not here.

29
00:01:36,166 --> 00:01:37,875
So she's unable
to arrive anywhere,

30
00:01:37,958 --> 00:01:40,083
or even to materialize.

31
00:01:41,916 --> 00:01:43,500
Can't you do something about it?

32
00:01:43,583 --> 00:01:45,458
That's what you came for, right?

33
00:01:45,541 --> 00:01:47,750
Why else would you be
here, if not to save her?

34
00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:50,291
That's why you
destroyed the Scub!

35
00:01:52,041 --> 00:01:53,875
Eureka said you were summoned.

36
00:01:53,958 --> 00:01:56,916
The Quartz Gun reportedly has
the potential to affect events,

37
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,250
altering the past and, thus,
the present and future as well.

38
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:01,750
However.

39
00:02:01,833 --> 00:02:03,666
Take a look.

40
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,291
As you can see, the Gun
is a large mass of Quartz

41
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:09,833
that has taken the
shape of a weapon.

42
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:13,791
With it, we can manipulate
time and change the world.

43
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:18,166
I think we can fire it
at least once more.

44
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:19,625
You've been looking for it, too.

45
00:02:19,708 --> 00:02:21,166
Like my mom said.

46
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,083
So this is it, huh?

47
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:46,750
This island is where
Eureka gave birth to you?

48
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:54,166
Thank you for everything
you've done for us.

49
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:57,250
It's been ten years since
my mom disappeared in the Burst.

50
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:59,333
Where have you
been all this time?

51
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:00,583
What have you been doing?

52
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:01,916
Ten years?

53
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,791
How 'bout that.

54
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:04,958
No wonder you've gotten so big.

55
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:11,875
For me, it hasn't been that
long since I sent Eureka over.

56
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:14,125
It was just the other day.

57
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:15,000
The other day?

58
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:16,958
What are you talking about?

59
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:18,416
Mister Thurston!

60
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,375
Please, how is
that even possible?

61
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:23,583
Ao.

62
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,416
Are you much of a soccer player?

63
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,000
How can we be
sure that this man

64
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:33,333
who appeared earlier doesn't
represent some new threat?

65
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:36,083
I think we ought to increase
our surveillance measures.

66
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:38,583
He's Ao's father
and Eureka's husband.

67
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:41,041
What kind of threat
do you think he poses?

68
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:42,291
You already know that Eureka

69
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:44,583
and the Gekko came
over here before, right?

70
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:47,083
We learned something
important then.

71
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:48,583
That the Scub Corals
that came to this universe

72
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:50,625
were traveling in time.

73
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:55,166
From the distant future
of this universe's Earth,

74
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,000
into the distant past.

75
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:13,125
Quartz open doorways
to parallel universes.

76
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:17,541
This universe developed
a response to that threat.

77
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:20,291
It began automatically
producing Secrets.

78
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,666
In order to survive,
the Scub Corals needed

79
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:39,750
to find a place where
there were no Secrets.

80
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:42,750
And so they traveled back
in time to this planet's past.

81
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:55,291
But the Secrets
came through the holes

82
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:57,708
that the Scubs ripped
in the fabric of time

83
00:04:57,791 --> 00:05:00,583
and continued their
relentless pursuit.

84
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:03,375
That is where the history
of Scub Bursts begins.

85
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:17,958
In the future, mankind
had ceased to exist,

86
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:20,375
because of Scub Bursts.

87
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,166
The Secrets were
partly to blame, as well.

88
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,958
They began to see
even us as threats

89
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:26,958
to the universe and attacked.

90
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,541
Don't let your
guard down, Eureka!

91
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:07,666
Renton?

92
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,083
Listen to me.

93
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:12,875
Follow the Scubs' Light Pillar
and go to another time.

94
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:16,208
Somewhere with as low
levels of Trapars as possible.

95
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:17,791
What are you planning, Renton?

96
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:19,833
I'll wipe out the
Scub Corals here.

97
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:21,250
It has to be done.

98
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:22,791
If you're staying, so am I!

99
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:24,958
I won't make you
kill the Scubs, Eureka!

100
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:30,250
Please just go.

101
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,333
Renton?

102
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:41,166
Renton? Renton!
Renton! I can't leave you!

103
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:45,791
Please, Renton! Renton? Renton!

104
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:50,916
So, in the distant past,
Eureka gave birth to you.

105
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,458
and did what she
could to protect you.

106
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:57,291
Renton.

107
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,708
No, I mean, Dad.

108
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:00,583
Why are you and Mom doing this?

109
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:01,916
Why go to such
incredible lengths

110
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,041
to destroy the Scub Corals?

111
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:06,000
We have to take responsibility.

112
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:07,958
Responsibility for what?

113
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:09,750
For our previous actions.

114
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:12,250
At one time, we fought to
protect the Scub Corals.

115
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:15,083
 Oh, I see.

116
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:17,416
Naru said that Mama was
the same as the Scubs.

117
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,916
So how can you be trying
to wipe them out now?

118
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,041
Because of what our
initial protection wrought.

119
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:23,250
It's because of us

120
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:24,541
that Scub Bursts now
occur in this universe.

121
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:26,041
We're responsible!

122
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:28,166
I have to make it right!

123
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,250
Ao?

124
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:32,041
Mr. Thurston,
what are you doing?!

125
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:33,625
Ao!

126
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:35,583
I'm going back to my time.

127
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:38,000
To ten thousand
years into the future.

128
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:42,000
Wait, come back!

129
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:44,125
You can't just leave!

130
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:45,250
What are you doing??

131
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:47,291
You're going to
abandon her again?!

132
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:55,750
What is it, Gramps?

133
00:07:57,791 --> 00:07:59,708
Let's get out of here, Nirvash.

134
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:01,625
It's time to finish this!

135
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,375
I'm sorry.

136
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:24,916
I still have to go, Gramps.

137
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
But why?!

138
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:27,458
Despite what you said.

139
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:29,958
Despite everything,
I still think Dad's wrong!

140
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:49,833
Ao.

141
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:51,958
I guess it's no surprise
you're a good pilot.

142
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:00,041
Ao.

143
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:01,041
I'm sorry.

144
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:02,708
Don't apologize.

145
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:04,333
Just stop screwing
up so badly

146
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:06,666
that you have to
say sorry to a kid!

147
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,041
I'm taking the
Quartz gun with me.

148
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:09,500
I'm going to use it.

149
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:11,000
With it, I'll shoot
the first Scub Coral

150
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,208
that appeared on this Earth.

151
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:14,625
That will make it

152
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:17,083
so that the Scub Corals
never existed in this universe.

153
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:19,041
in the future or the past.

154
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,458
Do see, Ao?

155
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:23,083
By doing this, I'll restore
the universe to the way

156
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:24,916
it was supposed to be!

157
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:28,958
Don't do it. Don't.

158
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:31,000
It can only be fired once more!

159
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:32,500
What about Mama?

160
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:34,541
Eureka is prepared
for this, too.

161
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:49,666
What now?

162
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,083
I can't shake these things!

163
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:53,500
Are you ready for this?

164
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:54,875
We're firing back.

165
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:04,333
Those maneuvers.

166
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:05,708
Impossible?

167
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:07,958
There shouldn't be an
Archetype in the Neo!

168
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:09,500
Ow.

169
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:10,958
That was good, Ao.

170
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:12,041
Moving on!

171
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:12,791
This is crazy.

172
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:14,041
Of all people,

173
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:16,375
why the hell would I be
hearing Truth's voice?

174
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:17,916
What are you talking about?

175
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,791
You and I have been working
together for a long time now.

176
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:24,041
What else would I be doing?

177
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:26,750
As Archetypes, it is our
desire to help the LFO pilots

178
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:29,250
who need us in
whatever way we can.

179
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:30,458
Now then, Ao.

180
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:31,916
What are your orders?

181
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:35,583
So that's what happened.

182
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:37,125
I see.

183
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:39,000
The Truth I knew was a Secret,

184
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:40,958
but in the world
after the Quartz Gun

185
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:44,166
was fired a second time,
he exists as an Archetype.

186
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:47,250
All right.

187
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:49,333
So does that make this the
one and only truth, Truth?

188
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:52,375
Or is this now the truth that
you were wishing for all along?

189
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:54,750
What in the world are
you muttering about?

190
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:55,625
Heads up!

191
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:58,458
I don't understand?

192
00:10:58,541 --> 00:10:59,625
What is that unit doing
with an Archetype?!

193
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:08,541
Ao?

194
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:10,041
Get out of that unit!

195
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:12,833
There only has to be a single
Nirvash with an archetype.

196
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:14,458
All we need is the original.

197
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:17,041
What, according to you?

198
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:18,500
Who do you think you are?!

199
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:21,541
Damn it, Ao!

200
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:27,500
Where the hell is it going?

201
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,416
Get back here! Stupid little--

202
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,625
Just stay out of my way!

203
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:47,833
Gramps told me
something after you left.

204
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:48,666
Oh, yeah?

205
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,875
He told me about my sister!

206
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:54,291
Wait, Ao.

207
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:57,250
You asked me once if
you had an older sister.

208
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:59,375
Why are you
bringing that up now?

209
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:01,708
You see, Eureka
told me about her.

210
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:03,291
Three months after she was born,

211
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:05,541
she turned hard
as stone and died.

212
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:10,000
When Trapar
concentrations are high,

213
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:11,750
the cells within the
child of a Coralian

214
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:14,833
and a human will begin
to reject each other.

215
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:19,291
They turn hard, like ocean
coral does when it dies.

216
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:22,541
So when your second
child was on the way,

217
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:26,375
you decided it had to be raised
in a world with no Trapars.

218
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:28,916
You chose this universe,

219
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,916
this Earth that Mama
had stumbled across.

220
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,958
However, there were
Scub Corals here, too.

221
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:38,916
So you sought to destroy them.

222
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:42,375
Thank you for that, Dad.

223
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:45,583
For sacrificing so much
to try to keep me alive.

224
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:48,375
Thank you.

225
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:50,041
Where are you going?

226
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:52,166
And I'm sorry Dad.

227
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,250
But you can't do this!

228
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:56,333
See, I have a very good friend.

229
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:59,375
And she happens to
be a Coral Carrier.

230
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:02,208
She and the Scubs
live symbiotically.

231
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:10,791
If you change it so that Scubs
never existed in this world,

232
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:11,875
what will happen
to my friend Naru

233
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,833
and all the people like her?

234
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:15,375
What about them?

235
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:17,875
If they have, in fact, become
one with the Scub Corals,

236
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:20,708
then it's possible that they
will vanish along with them.

237
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:25,166
But there's not other way Ao!

238
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:26,750
You screwed up big time.

239
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:30,583
And your solution is to go back
and just erase your mistake?!

240
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:36,291
I knew a man named
Christophe Blanc.

241
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:38,708
He told me to
find out what's right.

242
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:39,916
At first I thought he said that

243
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,666
because the Secrets
weren't the true enemy,

244
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,833
and we needed to
figure out who was.

245
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:45,500
but that's not what he meant.

246
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:46,833
Even if I did figure that out,

247
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:49,041
it would only lead
to more fighting.

248
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:50,041
Listen to me.

249
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:51,375
Please, Ao.

250
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:53,083
If the planet remains
this way, your body will--

251
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,083
I grew up on this planet!

252
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:57,750
Maybe we kids haven't
lived as long as you adults,

253
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:59,958
but we have had our own lives.

254
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:02,083
I can't just turn
my back on everything.

255
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:03,708
I don't want to
forget the life I've lived

256
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:07,833
just because it's convenient!

257
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:11,250
Come back here!

258
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:26,958
There it is.

259
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:29,416
The Pole Light of Okinawa.

260
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:37,958
That's how Dad
got to this world.

261
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:38,791
Wait?

262
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:40,208
What are you planning to do?

263
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:41,458
Ao!

264
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:43,166
You're not going into
the Pole Light, are you?

265
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,166
I know what you're doing.

266
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,583
You're going to
save your mother!

267
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:48,500
Why, Ao?

268
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:50,333
Have you forgotten
what you said?

269
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:52,208
You said that we were family.

270
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:53,625
Remember?

271
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:55,916
But now you're going to
leave us for your real family.

272
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,958
Aren't you?

273
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:58,375
Was it all just talk?!

274
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:00,375
That's not it.

275
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:03,458
I'm sorry, but I have
to put an end to it all.

276
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:07,416
I am going to save
my mother, and then--

277
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,208
Then what, Ao?

278
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:11,333
Then I'll--

279
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:13,458
I...

280
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:17,750
You idiot!

281
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,333
Taking all of it on yourself.

282
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:21,583
Idiot?

283
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:23,125
You hear me?!

284
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:24,541
You're an idiot!

285
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:36,750
The Quartz will
respond to the desires

286
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:38,833
of an intelligent life form.

287
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:39,958
All right then.

288
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:41,125
Quartz?

289
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:43,750
Take me to the
Scub Burst ten years ago.

290
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:44,916
To where my mom is.

291
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:49,500
It's no use.

292
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:51,041
I have to take it away.

293
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:53,125
Now.

294
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:56,041
I'm sorry?

295
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:57,750
I'm sorry, Ao!

296
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:08,166
It's you.

297
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,958
Ao it's you!

298
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,666
How did you know it was me?

299
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,291
At this point, I'm still a baby.

300
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:19,625
I'm just two, right?

301
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:20,666
Silly.

302
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:23,333
You told me before, remember?

303
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:25,416
I strayed into this
era with the Gekko.

304
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,583
You can't have forgotten
about that already.

305
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:29,500
I was falling through the sky,

306
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:31,291
and then your Nirvash appeared.

307
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:34,250
You pulled me through the
light back to where I came from.

308
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:37,416
You mean the other
Nirvash I saw was me?

309
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:41,041
I knew you would come, Renton.

310
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,333
I knew it!

311
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:44,500
Mama.

312
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:45,916
Is that you, Ao?

313
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,375
I don't understand.

314
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:49,291
You were over
there a minute ago...

315
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:51,083
...and did you just
call me "Mama"?

316
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:52,708
Yes, I did.

317
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:55,083
Because that's who you are.

318
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:56,208
You see.

319
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:57,458
I'm your son.

320
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:59,250
Thank you for everything

321
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:00,875
and goodbye.

322
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:10,500
This is the world I know.

323
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:12,000
I've come back.

324
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:16,416
Thank you for returning me, Ao!

325
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,750
I understood then.

326
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:21,666
That I was going to
have another child, a boy.

327
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,291
A son named Ao.

328
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,916
That must be how
Dad knew who I was.

329
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,250
Honestly, why didn't you just
explain it to me right away?

330
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:31,333
Would you have
believed me even if I did?

331
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:35,791
And besides, the child you
were carrying was my sister.

332
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:37,166
Yes, it was.

333
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,333
So you know about that, too.

334
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:57,791
Renton!

335
00:17:58,958 --> 00:17:59,750
Go with him.

336
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:01,125
Go with Dad.

337
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:02,458
I can't go now.

338
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:04,208
If I leave the Quartz
here in this world, then--

339
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:05,416
It must have been hard for you.

340
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,625
Fighting and killing your fellow
Scubs, but you still did it.

341
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:10,916
You and Dad both,

342
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,166
and all because of me.

343
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:15,625
No, that's not true!

344
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:18,250
Someone once told me
that the things I'd done--

345
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:19,458
falling in love with Renton

346
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:21,458
and deciding to have
children with him--

347
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:23,375
were selfish
acts on my part.

348
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:24,708
Don't you see?

349
00:18:24,791 --> 00:18:26,791
That's why this is
our responsibility.

350
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:28,208
And because of that,

351
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:31,291
you've had to sacrifice
yourselves, and others, as well.

352
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:32,958
But it's time for
that to change.

353
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:36,875
You can be free of it
now, because I'm here.

354
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:39,791
And I think that's the
reason I was born.

355
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:41,750
Oh, Ao.

356
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:45,791
Doing it for you.

357
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:49,416
That wouldn't have been
a hardship at all, son.

358
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,666
What are you doing, Renton?

359
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:55,416
Don't cry in front of Ao.

360
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:07,291
Mom.

361
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:08,458
Dad.

362
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:09,708
Thank you.

363
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:11,166
And don't worry.

364
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,708
Okay?

365
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:15,750
We'll manage somehow, in this
world that we've inherited.

366
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:23,458
But the first thing I need
to do is send you two back.

367
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:27,208
You're going home.

368
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:35,125
How much longer
will my body last?

369
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:37,708
There's no way of knowing that.

370
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:41,250
Even so, I will have faith.

371
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:44,541
Mom, Dad, you chose
this planet to be my home,

372
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:46,875
and I believe in the
strength of its people.

373
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:48,583
And the brightness
of its future!

374
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:28,916
Seriously, you guys?

375
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,875
That is just plain embarrassing.

376
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:34,500
And to think, these
people are my parents.

377
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:36,500
Silly as it is,
I'm glad it's there.

378
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:39,333
They sacrificed so much,
but they're home now.

379
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,500
Well, Truth.

380
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:22,583
Where have we
popped out this time?

381
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:23,750
I don't know.

382
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:25,333
I'm looking into it.

383
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:27,000
Great, thanks.

384
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:29,333
Date confirmed.

385
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:31,875
It's the year 2027

386
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:35,833
June fifteenth, to be exact.

387
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:36,541
Are you serious?

388
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:38,291
We've come back?

389
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:39,625
Come back where?

390
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:41,166
What are you talking about?

391
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,041
You know that
isn't possible, Ao.

392
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:45,250
You fired the
Quartz Gun three times.

393
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:48,083
That's three
historical rewrites.

394
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:50,125
This is no longer
the world you knew.

395
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:51,416
In fact.

396
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,166
Ao Fukai might not
even be alive in this world.

397
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:58,125
If that's the case, you won't
exist in anyone's memory.

398
00:21:58,208 --> 00:22:01,208
You rescued your mother,
bid her farewell forever,

399
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:02,916
and wandered through time.

400
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,666
Now, after everything
you've been through,

401
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:07,500
your closest friends may not
even know your name.

402
00:22:07,583 --> 00:22:09,875
Even so, it'll be okay.

403
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:12,291
She came to a strange place

404
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:15,166
and gave birth to
me all by herself.

405
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,541
Mama fought alone

406
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:18,791
because she had to in
order to keep her son alive.

407
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:20,458
Compared to that.

408
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:22,500
This is nothing, really.

409
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:24,750
So, Truth, what'll you do?

410
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:27,166
I still haven't seen
enough of this world.

411
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,625
It's a big place.

412
00:22:28,708 --> 00:22:29,916
I see.

413
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,583
So, you're going, then?

414
00:22:31,666 --> 00:22:32,500
Yes.

415
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:34,875
This is goodbye.

416
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:36,541
So long.

417
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:39,666
I'll see you again
somewhere, or somewhen.
