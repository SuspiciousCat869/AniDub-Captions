1
00:01:43,666 --> 00:01:45,666
I wonder how long
they've had those things.

2
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,000
They definitely
woulda come in handy

3
00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:49,083
during our showdown
with the Secrets.

4
00:01:49,166 --> 00:01:50,333
Rumor has it they've
been saving 'em,

5
00:01:50,416 --> 00:01:52,583
for a day like today.

6
00:01:52,666 --> 00:01:54,375
You gotta be kidding.

7
00:01:54,458 --> 00:01:57,916
They built those things just to
deal with a security company?

8
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,333
That's crazy.

9
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:26,750
It's a total outage.

10
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:29,500
Did something go wrong
at the power facility?

11
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:30,791
No!

12
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:33,041
I'd just removed
the copy-protection,

13
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:35,666
all that work and I was
finally about to burn it!

14
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,166
What's with you?

15
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,916
It's the version sent out
before the official release.

16
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,458
Parts of the CG
weren't completed

17
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:42,791
in time for distribution.

18
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:43,750
Huh?

19
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:44,833
Never mind.

20
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:46,416
It's not something
you'd understand.

21
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,916
Why don't you go and ask Daddy
Dearest what's happening here?

22
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,625
Run along.

23
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:52,333
Are we still doing this?

24
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:55,791
I thought we had
both put it behind us.

25
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:57,166
I've decided I'm
not going to hide

26
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:59,291
how I really feel anymore.

27
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:02,083
Attention.

28
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:03,250
We have received a report

29
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:05,000
from the Security
Department concerning

30
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:07,166
the recent power outage.

31
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,166
It wasn't an accident?

32
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,625
It seems the power company

33
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:13,625
has terminated our account
and halted all transmission.

34
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:15,041
Our contract's up?

35
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:17,000
What about the
on-site power station?

36
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:18,333
Our account with
the power company

37
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:20,250
is just a backup, isn't it?

38
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,666
The Generation Bleu power
station has been shut down

39
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:25,291
since yesterday due to
an emergency inspection.

40
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:27,583
The higher-ups ordered it.

41
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:28,833
When you say "higher-ups,"

42
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:30,583
do you mean the people
at our parent company?

43
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:33,541
Big Blue World or whatever?

44
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:35,333
Christophe.

45
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:37,208
I want an explanation,
immediately!

46
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:39,333
What the hell are
they playing at?!

47
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:43,500
Sorry, I'm still
a little jet-lagged.

48
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:45,291
Hold on a sec, will you?

49
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:47,875
Hey, Blanc! Hey!

50
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:50,291
Okay.

51
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:51,666
Let's go over
everything one more

52
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,541
before we wrap this up.

53
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:54,625
Very well.

54
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:56,916
First, a precondition.

55
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,375
If I should die, this agreement

56
00:03:58,458 --> 00:04:00,458
will pass to my
daughter, Fleur Blanc.

57
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:03,208
It will remain in
effect under her control.

58
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:04,916
What's up, Chief?

59
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,458
Something wrong
with President Blanc?

60
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:08,958
Apparently, things aren't going
so well with the higher-ups.

61
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:09,958
The who?

62
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,458
Christophe acted right away

63
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:14,000
when he learned there was
a way to prevent Scub Bursts.

64
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:16,916
He knew the world needed an
organization like this one,

65
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,458
but to start it up, he needed
a colossal amount of funding.

66
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:23,875
So he turned to a PR firm,
based in the United States.

67
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:27,458
Hello, Fleur!

68
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:30,750
I hear you got your
Third Engine up and running.

69
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:31,958
Congratu--

70
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:34,958
Is it our fault that
this is happening now?

71
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,583
We used a show of
force to bring Ao back.

72
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:40,125
Is that why
Big Blue World is so angry?

73
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:43,416
I'll be blunt with you, my dear.

74
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,625
That is one reason.

75
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:46,041
Most definitely.

76
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:47,708
In that case,
it's actually my fault.

77
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:49,750
Well, then, why haven't
you punished us...?

78
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:52,000
Don't let me off the hook
because I'm your daughter.

79
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:55,666
Yes, I admit it: I'm
guilty of favoritism.

80
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:58,541
Even when you first said
you wanted to pilot an IFO,

81
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:01,000
I made sure you were assigned
a data recording craft

82
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:03,541
because it was the least
likely to get you hurt.

83
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:06,208
But I didn't get in the
way of you becoming a pilot.

84
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:10,041
I wanted you to be proud of what
you were doing with your life.

85
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:12,958
I never wanted you
to have any regrets.

86
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:21,333
Oh, one more thing.

87
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:24,583
Our company will no longer
spend time eliminating Secrets.

88
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:25,541
What are you saying?!

89
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,375
Things are gonna change.

90
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:28,708
Starting today we'll
focus our operations

91
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:32,500
on suppressing the
proliferation of Scub Corals.

92
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:37,833
In accordance with
the UN resolution,

93
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:39,375
we have made a decision.

94
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:42,416
Generation Bleu has shown itself
to have violent tendencies.

95
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,583
Tendencies that we here

96
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:45,916
at Big Blue World
cannot overlook.

97
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,833
We have advised
CEO Christophe Blanc

98
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:50,000
that the enterprise
will be liquidated.

99
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:52,708
Here you see the percentage
of shares our company holds.

100
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:55,500
Our withdrawal will essentially
force them to shut their doors.

101
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:58,083
But up until this point,

102
00:05:58,166 --> 00:06:00,750
your company has completely
supported Generation Bleu.

103
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:02,208
Of course.

104
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:03,708
We had our own
people in place there

105
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:07,083
and were assured there were
no issues with compliance.

106
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:08,916
However, Blanc
retained possession

107
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,750
of the Quartz without
our knowledge.

108
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:14,333
He even had the audacity
to put it to use as a weapon.

109
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:16,625
So, they're finally
pulling the plug.

110
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:19,458
This will give Japan
an even greater advant--

111
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:27,500
Hah! What's the matter?

112
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:30,375
Think you'll fool people
by pretending to be asleep?

113
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:31,750
Oh, come on.

114
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:33,375
Couldn't you make an
appointment like everyone else?

115
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:35,125
What do you plan
to do about this?

116
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:37,666
It's past time to cut your
ties with this terrorist.

117
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:40,416
What's brought this on?

118
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,750
You're in a particularly
foul mood today.

119
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:45,041
Nothing's happening.

120
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:47,458
More Coral plants are
reactivating every day

121
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:51,583
across the globe, but not a
single Secret has appeared.

122
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:53,625
I'm sure there's
a reason for that.

123
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:55,166
The Quartz Gun is the key.

124
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,333
Nirvash's new weapon
is pushing the world

125
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:59,375
ever closer to chaos
and destruction.

126
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:01,333
But it can't happen
without the Secrets.

127
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:02,750
Be quiet.

128
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:09,458
No, I mean you, Truth.

129
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:12,625
I am speaking to you, not them.

130
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:13,833
Secret?

131
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:15,000
Is that you?

132
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:17,291
I will tell you what
you wish to know.

133
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:21,458
We are temporarily refraining
from launching a new attack.

134
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:22,750
But why?!

135
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:26,208
Generation Bleu is
public enemy number one.

136
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:28,250
The gun is giving rise to chaos!

137
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:29,375
It is time!

138
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:31,125
Think this through, Truth.

139
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:33,458
Recall what our objective is.

140
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:35,500
Chaos is not what we seek.

141
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:37,833
Our goal is order.

142
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:40,375
You said "we." What do you mean?

143
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:43,083
You are a Secret,
as well, are you not?

144
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:46,333
Is it possible that
you've forgotten?

145
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:48,583
Hey, Truth?

146
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:50,291
Hello?

147
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:51,750
What are you suggesting?

148
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:52,541
You're wrong!

149
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:54,791
That's ridiculous!

150
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:06,250
You do not have the
ability to destroy Secrets.

151
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:15,708
Naru. Naru.

152
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:25,541
You see, Truth.

153
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:28,833
The Allied Forces don't
know what to do with us.

154
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:31,125
We share their desire
to protect the Scub Corals,

155
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:33,083
so they may prefer
to leave us alone.

156
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:36,041
That isn't the
answer I asked for!

157
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:37,166
Fine.

158
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,125
You wanted to know
if you're a Secret.

159
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:40,958
Yes, you are.

160
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:44,166
I know because I saw you
inside the Scub Coral.

161
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:49,875
As everyone knows,
ten years ago,

162
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:53,458
there was an enormous
Scub Burst in Okinawa.

163
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:54,875
With it appeared a Secret.

164
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:57,833
One bigger than
anyone had seen before.

165
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,708
But then the
Quartz was taken away,

166
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:07,708
and the Secret's sense of
purpose was lost, as well.

167
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:12,000
And so, in order to find
a place in this world,

168
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:14,541
it took the shape of a human.

169
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:18,791
And I was that Secret.

170
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:23,208
I transformed into a boy,
and Johansson found me.

171
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:28,041
And now, you're the one who
gave me wings and let me fly.

172
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:30,375
You're the one who told
me what I have to do.

173
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:33,500
That, together, we
must change this world.

174
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:36,708
Humans must learn to become
one with the Scub Corals.

175
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:40,250
That union will give us
freedom and infinite power--

176
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,458
Don't you see?

177
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:57,250
You are no ordinary
Secret any longer, Truth.

178
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:59,166
You're the same as me.

179
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:02,500
By guiding you,
Naru, I was helping

180
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:05,125
the Secrets and Scub
Corals destroy the world.

181
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:07,958
That's what I've
believed all this time.

182
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:13,041
But now, I think, that maybe
you were the one guiding me.

183
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:17,625
This could never have
worked without you.

184
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:20,250
Ao would never have the
power that he has now.

185
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:40,833
Firecracker.

186
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:44,208
Yet another guise in
which this Truth appears.

187
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:46,583
Manipulating the
flow of electrons.

188
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:52,500
I can do that; is that ability
part of a Secret's power?

189
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:07,041
I know the living
quarters may not be able

190
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,583
to hold the entire staff,
but surely we can take in

191
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:11,750
all the IFO team
members, can't we?

192
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:13,750
It was originally meant
to be an ark, of sorts,

193
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:16,625
in case of a cataclysm,
so we do have extra space.

194
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:17,458
Wait.

195
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:18,541
Ao and the others are going

196
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:20,125
to be moving into
the space station?

197
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:22,041
It may well come to that, yes.

198
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:24,833
Okay, but then what
happens after that?

199
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:26,500
The CEO says we're not
fighting Secrets anymore,

200
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:28,291
so what are we going to do?

201
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:30,791
For now, avoid fighting
battles we don't have to.

202
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:32,041
Hey, Mom.

203
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:35,000
I'm detecting satellites
drifting into our orbit.

204
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,458
Then we'll move
to a different one.

205
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:38,458
Immediately.

206
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:39,916
We can't do that.

207
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:44,333
Multiple satellites have already
collided into each other.

208
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:46,791
There is metal
flying everywhere.

209
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:51,208
There's nothing we can do; we're
heading for the debris storm.

210
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:14,125
Multiple communication
satellites belonging

211
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:17,083
to the US and other Allied
nations have been destroyed.

212
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:20,916
We believe they were attacked
by Generation Bleu's satellite.

213
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
As the vanguard of the
Allied Forces the fight is ours.

214
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:27,083
We must take control of
this rogue organization.

215
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:30,833
There you are, Maggie.

216
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:31,916
How are you feeling?

217
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,208
Fine, thank you, sir.

218
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:35,375
Colonel.

219
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:36,833
Those children we
saw aboard the carrier

220
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:39,875
the other day are Generation
Bleu's IFO pilots, right?

221
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:41,125
Yeah.

222
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:43,125
They're the ones we're
going to be fighting?

223
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:45,666
Some think Gen. Bleu has
gotten away with child abuse

224
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:49,833
by using the children's ability
to pilot IFOs as an excuse.

225
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:51,083
I would like to find some way

226
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:53,791
to bring them in
under our protection.

227
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:55,833
You can count on my
full support with that.

228
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,375
Blanc can't leave
his post right now,

229
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:06,458
so I'll be-- Hey,
what are you doing?

230
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:09,875
I am temporarily deleting
our tactical support program.

231
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:11,125
Deleting Georg?

232
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:12,000
Seriously?

233
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:13,291
What'll happen once he's gone?

234
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,541
We won't be doing any
flying, that's for sure.

235
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:19,000
The Triton and the IFOs each
require high level controls.

236
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:21,250
Without Georg, we
can't pilot any of them.

237
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:23,000
There's nothing to worry about.

238
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:24,750
I'll roll him back to
the previous version,

239
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:27,250
so it's just like a
temporary downgrade.

240
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:29,125
Why are you doing it
in the first place?

241
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:32,625
Well, it's because of
the virus Han introduced.

242
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:34,375
You're talking about the Secret?

243
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:35,791
Yes.

244
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:36,958
When you were in Japan,

245
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:39,208
you brought Georg
into contact with it,

246
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:41,125
and in that moment,
all instances

247
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:43,208
of Georg were synchronized.

248
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:46,833
Because of that, Georg is now
a different kind of program:

249
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:49,291
one merged with the
awareness of a Secret.

250
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:50,583
It's far too dangerous

251
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:54,166
to continue using such an
unknown entity, so--

252
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,375
Did you make the
decision to delete him,

253
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:58,833
or did that come down the
pipeline from the higher-ups?

254
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:00,750
It would be the same either way.

255
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:02,041
We can't let it be known

256
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:04,583
that we had a Secret
burrowed into our system.

257
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:07,166
The Allies wouldn't
even negotiate with us.

258
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:10,375
Big Blue World already cut off
all our funding, didn't they?

259
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:12,791
What do you plan
to do about that?

260
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:15,166
I'm hoping the
decision can be reversed.

261
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,000
I want to make them
realize Generation Bleu

262
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:19,000
can still be of value to them.

263
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:20,916
To do that, dangerous
elements must---

264
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Dangerous?

265
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:23,500
So now it's dangerous
to have contact

266
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:25,000
with a Secret again?

267
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:26,375
It always has been.

268
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:28,708
We were established to
fight against the Secrets,

269
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:32,000
and doing that is the only way
to keep this organization alive.

270
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:33,208
And what about Ivica?

271
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:34,291
How does he feel?

272
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:36,750
Does he want to keep fighting?

273
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:37,708
Leave him out of it.

274
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:38,750
No, I won't!

275
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:40,416
It's not about the company!

276
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,583
Tell me why you're
really doing this!

277
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:46,291
They've arrived.

278
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,708
The Poseidon was shot down.

279
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:52,291
We will avenge their deaths.

280
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:02,166
Is it true?

281
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:04,333
About the Poseidon?

282
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:07,916
We don't know yet, but
we're going to find out.

283
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,625
In accordance with the UN
resolution the Allied Forces

284
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:13,166
will seize all Quartz
possessed by Generation Bleu,

285
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,666
as well as the weapon
of mass destruction

286
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,083
that is believed to be a
product of that Quartz.

287
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:19,541
Furthermore, we
will prohibit them

288
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:22,958
from any further
use of IFOs or FPs.

289
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:25,041
Funding has been revoked,
and Generation Bleu,

290
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,583
as a business, has
already been shut down.

291
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:29,583
No one should remain
at headquarters

292
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:30,958
for any other purpose--

293
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:32,791
Ao, where's the Gun?

294
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:34,041
It's down in the basement

295
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:37,125
so it can be kept
under strict surveillance.

296
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:38,333
Places like this always tend

297
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:40,250
to have something
in the basement.

298
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:42,541
Things that look like this.

299
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:45,250
You don't want to
use it though, right?

300
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:49,916
You wouldn't understand,
even if I tried to explain.

301
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,375
No, I understand.

302
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:52,375
Oh, really?

303
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:53,625
If you fire it,

304
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:56,166
both the Secrets and the
Scub Corals will vanish.

305
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,583
The world will be changed.

306
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:01,250
It will become the
world I am from.

307
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:02,416
Uh, what?

308
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,708
I'm going to be
straight with you guys.

309
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:05,625
You should know.

310
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:07,375
I'm not a person of this world.

311
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:08,250
What?!

312
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:10,291
The manga obsession has to stop.

313
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:11,833
You've got it wrong, Fleur.

314
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:15,000
It isn't that I'm
obsessed with manga.

315
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:18,000
It's that I've experienced
something so manga-like,

316
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:20,583
that I can only have
faith in the impossible.

317
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:23,125
Which means what exactly?

318
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:25,833
Like I told you, I come
from a different world.

319
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:33,208
I want go back there--back
where I belong.

320
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:34,916
You'll return me to my world.

321
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,416
Right?

322
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,833
Why ask me?

323
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:39,000
Because it was Eureka

324
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:40,958
who brought me here
in the first place.

325
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:44,208
Hey, change of plans.

326
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:45,500
Whoops. Sorry.

327
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:48,125
You won't be launching
your IFOs now.

328
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:49,833
The Poseidon is okay after all?

329
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:51,041
Sorry.

330
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:54,125
Rebecka's just deleted
Georg from the IFOs.

331
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:55,791
We're reinstalling
an older version

332
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:57,458
of the program right now,

333
00:16:57,541 --> 00:17:00,666
but it will take at least an
hour to reconcile the data.

334
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:01,875
But the Allies!

335
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:03,750
What if they launch
an attack against us?

336
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:05,583
I didn't mean to walk
in on you like that.

337
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:06,500
No big deal.

338
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:07,666
Ao was there.

339
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,041
You're totally fine
with him seeing it?

340
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:10,750
No, I'm not totally fine!

341
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,541
Oh, hey Dad.

342
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:19,958
What's up?

343
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:21,833
What're you doing here?

344
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:23,375
This is for your ears only.

345
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:26,166
Listen to me, Fleur, be
prepared to make a run for it.

346
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,500
What?

347
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:29,458
There's no saving
Generation Bleu at this point.

348
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:32,250
If it's just the two of us,
we can probably get away.

349
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:33,958
Give me a little while.

350
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:39,250
Don't be too mad at him.

351
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:42,416
First and foremost,
he's your father.

352
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,208
He's willing to abandon
the company,

353
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:46,833
if that's what it
takes to protect you.

354
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:49,416
That's kind of incredible.

355
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:53,583
Attention all IFOs.

356
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:54,875
Launch now!

357
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,875
Activating defensive grid.

358
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:06,791
Damn it, Christophe!

359
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:07,833
Where are you?

360
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,416
Come on, Fleur.
Let's get inside the Triton.

361
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,583
We'll be safer in there.

362
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:23,500
I have an idea.

363
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:25,500
Come with me.

364
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,583
Looks like they still
have power here.

365
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:32,416
But how's that possible?

366
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,791
What's that for?

367
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:40,791
Where's my-- the CEO?

368
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:42,000
He went inside.

369
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:43,916
Said something about
moving the Quartz Gun.

370
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,375
What is he thinking?

371
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,083
Sir?

372
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,375
Fleur, how could you?

373
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:06,791
Give it up.

374
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:09,416
My dad may be a stupid old man--

375
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,666
But he still knows me better
than anybody in the world.

376
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,750
Running away with him
like some cheap coward

377
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:18,041
and leaving everybody else
behind to clean up the mess.

378
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:20,333
He knows that's something
I would never do.

379
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:22,625
It's Truth!

380
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,750
You little brat.

381
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:34,458
What are you doing here, Ao?

382
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:35,916
I told you before.

383
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,458
I'm not letting you get
your hands on the gun.

384
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:39,833
Not ever.

385
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:42,166
It's the only link
I have to my mother.

386
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,833
It's not a weapon.

387
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,708
I won't let you use it like one.

388
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,791
That's enough!

389
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:52,750
I'll use this Quartz to change
the world, you can't stop me.

390
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:01,291
You okay?

391
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:02,000
Any injuries?

392
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:03,708
You're here!

393
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:05,666
I need a favor.

394
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,083
Look after Fleur.

395
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:08,625
Me? Why?

396
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,458
Today is the end
of Generation Bleu.

397
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:14,875
But there's still something
you and the others must do.

398
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:17,875
You have to find a way
to correct our mistake.

399
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:18,833
What mistake?!

400
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:20,666
What are you talking about?

401
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:24,833
It may be the Secrets were
not the enemy, after all.

402
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:26,375
But the Scub Corals were.

403
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:29,333
And theirs is the true
invasion of our world.

404
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:32,291
In countries all across the
globe, victims are being found

405
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:34,750
who have been
parasitized by the Scubs.

406
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:37,000
Like Naru, her illness.

407
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:39,083
Unfortunately, we
adults aren't very good

408
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:41,833
at rectifying this
kind of mistake.

409
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:45,583
We were utterly certain the
Secrets were malicious invaders.

410
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:48,791
We can't possibly admit
how wrong we've been,

411
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:52,375
but you, you of the younger
generation may figure out

412
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:54,250
a way to do what's right.

413
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:56,625
It's up to you.

414
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:00,083
Wait, Dad!

415
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:03,208
Come back!

416
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:05,250
The Nirvash will
still be able to fly,

417
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:07,875
even without Georg.
Get out of here.

418
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:08,958
Escape.

419
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:10,250
Fly away.

420
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:12,458
In the sky,
anything is possible!

421
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,625
What are you
playing at, old man?

422
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:31,666
Do you seriously think you
can take me on all by yourself?

423
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,000
You know, Truth.

424
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,416
I've read it, too.

425
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,250
The infamous book
that Johansson wrote.

426
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:41,541
I came away with a
certain hypothesis.

427
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:45,041
See, I think that you
are actually a Secret

428
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:47,250
who has lost his memories.

429
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:48,500
That's ridiculous!

430
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:51,333
You're wrong, both of you!

431
00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:53,708
Did you know that when a
Secret encounters Quartz,

432
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:56,333
the result is a
gigantic explosion?

433
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:59,000
I imagine you'll
be no exception.

434
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:00,833
What do you mean?

435
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:02,625
There isn't much Quartz left.

436
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:05,208
Most of it transformed
into the Quartz Gun.

437
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:07,958
But, see, we have been
lucky enough to collect some

438
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:11,916
over the last few days.
And it's all stored right here.

439
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,208
Are you saying?

440
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,166
Wait! No!

441
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:24,541
Let's see if I'm right!

442
00:22:31,208 --> 00:22:32,916
Dad, no!

443
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:15,708
Next time on Eureka Seven AO.

444
00:24:15,791 --> 00:24:17,166
In a last brave act,

445
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:20,416
Blanc sacrificed himself
to trigger a fusion blast.

446
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,750
To carry out his wish, Ao must
now reach for the Quartz gun.

447
00:24:23,833 --> 00:24:26,000
As the boy searches
for the right path,

448
00:24:26,083 --> 00:24:28,625
what will the adults do?

449
00:24:28,708 --> 00:24:34,000
Eureka Seven AO, Episode 20:
"last message."

450
00:24:34,083 --> 00:24:36,125
Hear the cry of the
children of the stars.
