1
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,416
Colonel.

2
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,458
Nik will be fine.

3
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:04,708
An odd name, I know.

4
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:08,750
I'm half Japanese
and half Hawaiian.

5
00:02:09,916 --> 00:02:12,166
Now, shall we begin?

6
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:37,458
Here! Instant tasty energy!

7
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:38,875
Cool.

8
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:40,333
Hey, what's up
with your technician?

9
00:02:40,416 --> 00:02:42,041
He seems kinda grumpy.

10
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:42,916
What?

11
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,333
He sounds fine to me.

12
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:45,500
Really?

13
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:49,958
JJ. JJ.

14
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:55,666
At least my technician's
not sleeping on the job.

15
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:56,916
Oh, shut up.

16
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:01,791
Attention, all personnel:

17
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:05,083
Third Engine activation
test is about to begin.

18
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:05,708
Roger.

19
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:07,041
Prepped and ready.

20
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:08,208
Third engine status?

21
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:09,666
Third engine connecting!

22
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:20,916
Okay.

23
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,708
Let's go "upsy-daisy," Fleur.

24
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:23,958
Roger.

25
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,041
Elena, retract
the auxiliary leg.

26
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:28,166
I'm on it.

27
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:14,333
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

28
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,416
What in the--

29
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,291
Somethin' ain't right, here!

30
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:35,250
A newbie could do it.

31
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:37,541
If Ao can, then so can I.

32
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:46,208
Oh, hey, the flower bloomed.

33
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:14,208
You scared the crap outta me.

34
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:16,916
You're not playing
"scuba diver" again are you?

35
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,333
Come on.

36
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:21,291
Can't you have your little
fantasies in your own tub?

37
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:22,958
I was just thinking.

38
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:24,833
What if you could breathe water?

39
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:26,458
If you had the chance
to live in the ocean

40
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:28,833
with dolphins forever,
would you take it?

41
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:30,000
I dunno.

42
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:31,750
I mean, it sounds like fun,

43
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:34,166
but I don't think I'd
want to stay there forever.

44
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:37,916
The life I know is on land
so that's where I belong.

45
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,583
Okay, the US version.

46
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:42,416
You're in manga land again.

47
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,625
Ao's different.

48
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:45,958
He chose the ending
in the European version.

49
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:48,833
He's never going to come back
to the world of people again.

50
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:50,000
This is stupid.

51
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,541
All your fan-girl
knowledge isn't really

52
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:53,333
that impressive, you know.

53
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:56,041
Just because you
don't understand doesn--

54
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:59,125
Here, I'll wash that for you.

55
00:05:59,208 --> 00:05:59,666
Huh?

56
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:00,750
Hey, stop it!

57
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:01,500
Come on!

58
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:02,583
It's okay!

59
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:04,083
Just let me take
care of it real quick!

60
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:06,375
Would you get off me?

61
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:09,958
Ever heard about something
called "personal space"?

62
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,375
What's all that?

63
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:26,291
I just need you to look
through the final contract.

64
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:28,416
A little light
reading for the trip.

65
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:31,166
Man.

66
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,833
A lot of fine print.

67
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:36,666
You didn't sign anything like
this with Generation Bleu?

68
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:40,916
Of course, Christophe Blanc
would never be that up front.

69
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,708
He wanted everyone
to believe his company

70
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:45,208
was an international
rescue organization,

71
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:48,458
even while he possessed a
weapon of mass destruction.

72
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,000
The Quartz Gun?

73
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:53,416
The Allied Forces are the only
ones capable of managing it.

74
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:57,291
From now on, you and the Nirvash
will be under our command.

75
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,666
Does that work for you?

76
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,208
Hey!

77
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:14,916
I have to admit, Ao, you
really do look a lot like her.

78
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:18,208
Her?

79
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:20,250
Hold on, are you
talking about my mother?

80
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:22,083
Yes, who else?

81
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:23,750
You're the spitting
image of her.

82
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:26,041
You know she was
one of us, don't you?

83
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:27,083
Huh?

84
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:28,625
Really?

85
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:32,833
It was thirteen years ago.

86
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:34,833
Your mother and the
Mark I suddenly appeared

87
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:37,250
in this world from
a beam of light.

88
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:40,291
Naturally, we tracked down
the craft as soon as we could,

89
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:41,458
but when we reached it,

90
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:44,125
there was no sign
of the pilot anywhere.

91
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:46,666
Then, three years later,

92
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,916
the largest Scub Burst
in history occurred

93
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,541
off the coast of Okinawa.

94
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:52,583
We knew we needed
help from somebody

95
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:54,208
who could operate the Mark I.

96
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:56,458
We located your
mother on Iwato Island,

97
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:58,208
where she had
been living with you.

98
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:00,083
Knowing the situation
was desperate,

99
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:04,458
she readily agreed to help
and joined the fight beside us.

100
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,666
She worked with the Allies.

101
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:11,166
Now, then, the UN's sent
your former boss a summons.

102
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,333
They would like
to hear his reasons

103
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:14,666
for hiding the
existence of the Quartz.

104
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,125
However, should the Quartz Gun

105
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:18,166
become the property
of the Allies,

106
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:21,125
I imagine the issue
would quietly disappear.

107
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:24,958
Let me know if you have
any problems with this draft.

108
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:27,875
If not, I'll have the
official papers drawn up.

109
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:31,083
Starting tomorrow
you will be one of us.

110
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:37,375
From now on, you and the Nirvash
will be under our command.

111
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:39,208
Does that work for you?

112
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:43,583
Now to send this
to those bastards.

113
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:47,000
I'm sick of babysitting.

114
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:09,875
If he's on a US
carrier, let me see.

115
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:11,666
He should be near San Diego now.

116
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,208
Hey, are you
running a simulation?

117
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:14,958
It's a plan for
a rescue mission.

118
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:17,041
We'd be up against
Eisenhowers, though.

119
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:19,333
Even with IFOs,
it would be close.

120
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:22,083
In terms of numbers,
we'd be outmatched.

121
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:24,625
Our financial backer
is an American company.

122
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:25,916
They wouldn't be thrilled

123
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,291
about us mounting
an assault on the Allies.

124
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:29,958
Yeah, no kidding.

125
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:31,541
Really.

126
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:34,166
What was Ao thinking,
pulling this stunt?

127
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,375
Is that you, Ao?

128
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:57,000
Yes, I, uh.

129
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:59,125
I know I left pretty suddenly.

130
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:00,916
I'm sorry.

131
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:04,750
I've seen the video
they forwarded.

132
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:07,208
Um, Chief.

133
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:08,625
What is it?

134
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:12,500
I've, I've done something
and it's really terrible,

135
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:14,083
and I can't change it.

136
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:15,791
If things stay the way they are,

137
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:17,875
I'm afraid of what
else might happen.

138
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:22,291
So, I think it's better
if I leave the company.

139
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:24,250
Do you have no faith in us, Ao?!

140
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:38,875
Damn it!

141
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:42,750
What the hell does
he expect me to do?

142
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:45,166
They'll be safer
without the gun around.

143
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:48,416
But even so, I can't abandon it.

144
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,000
It's my only link to my mom.

145
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:53,791
This is just the way
things have to be!

146
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:17,625
What's up?

147
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:19,750
We had a call from Ao.

148
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:21,750
He says he's not coming back.

149
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:24,041
Why not?

150
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:27,041
Why not? I don't know.

151
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:28,208
It's Ao.

152
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:30,000
He's got his reasons,
whatever they are.

153
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:32,541
He's been acting weird
since Operation Polaris.

154
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:33,291
So!

155
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:34,333
That's that, right?

156
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:36,125
We'll be fine without him.

157
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:38,666
"That's that"?

158
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,833
Did you even try to
find out the truth?

159
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:42,333
Well.

160
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,000
But that's how you
are though, right?

161
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:47,375
Are you afraid to ask?

162
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:48,958
Or do you think
you're just being kind

163
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,041
by not prying into
other people's lives?

164
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:52,416
Uh, what are you talking about?

165
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,666
The same goes for your
issues with your father,

166
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,375
and the accident,
and what's going on

167
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:58,333
with me right before your eyes!

168
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:00,208
Wait a sec!

169
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:01,500
That wig!

170
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:10,625
You knew I dug this grave.

171
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:12,291
Why didn't you ask me about it?

172
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:14,083
Don't tell me
you weren't curious.

173
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:16,041
It's not that--

174
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:17,875
You never want to
know anything, Fleur!

175
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:18,458
Don't you get it?!

176
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:19,750
I killed Miller!

177
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:21,458
And do you want to know why?

178
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:23,375
So I could take her identity!

179
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:24,333
Because I don't have one!

180
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:25,916
The real me doesn't exist!

181
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,250
This is a bummer.

182
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:49,625
I mean, come on.

183
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:52,208
We're still the ones who
saved the world, aren't we?

184
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:55,250
Look at him, laughing.

185
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:58,291
What's he so happy about?

186
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:01,125
Oh, hey.

187
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:07,916
Is the Gazelle Agency in
the comedy business now, too?

188
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,916
Comedy?

189
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,166
I'm being serious.

190
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,083
I would never joke
about something like that.

191
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,000
Whatever.

192
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,416
Can you just get to the point?

193
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,083
We're about to be interrogated
about the Quartz issue.

194
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:18,875
I'm not looking forward to it.

195
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:20,208
This thing with Ao.

196
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:23,208
Are you really sure you
wanna leave it like it is?

197
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:24,958
I know they're aggressively
pushing for him

198
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:26,500
to sign a contract with them,

199
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:29,916
but we need to remember the
United States isn't the enemy.

200
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,125
That sounds like
Stanley's opinion to me.

201
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:33,958
I want to know what you think.

202
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,083
Ready, Hallström?

203
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:41,083
Looks like the Inquisition's
about to begin.

204
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:43,666
Oh.

205
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:46,083
What's up?

206
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:47,916
I, um...

207
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,208
If you don't mind,
could we talk in private?

208
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:50,708
Ah!

209
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:51,458
Of course!

210
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:53,750
Say no more.

211
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:54,833
From the look of things,

212
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:56,125
she could use
somebody to comfort her,

213
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:57,208
if ya know what I mean.

214
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:59,083
Yeah, okay.

215
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:00,250
Don't know how long
I have, though.

216
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:02,541
I might be getting
a call from Rebecka.

217
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,250
Uh, Gazelle.

218
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:05,958
I mean, just the
sound of her voice!

219
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:08,166
I could listen to
her talk forev--

220
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:47,166
Hey!

221
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,166
Elena!

222
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:52,416
What are you worried about?

223
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,833
Your scar?

224
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:55,916
Don't be.

225
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Your boobs will
still grow in just fine.

226
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:58,375
Uh, what?

227
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:02,791
Goofball.

228
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:09,291
She thinks I don't want to know.

229
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:10,875
That's not it.

230
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:13,583
Fleur!

231
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:14,833
Bad timing, sorry!

232
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:16,708
But it's Elena!

233
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:19,291
Stand there all you want.

234
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:20,458
I'm going!

235
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:21,583
There's no way you'll
make it to the US

236
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:23,833
with the Trapars
the Kyrie can hold.

237
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:24,500
Stand down!

238
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:25,750
I don't care!

239
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:27,375
Now, shut up and open the gate!

240
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,833
What is that?!

241
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:36,458
Elena, stop!

242
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:38,333
What are you doing?!

243
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:40,708
Don't try to change my mind!

244
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:41,750
I'm going.

245
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:43,041
I'm bringing Ao back.

246
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:44,291
What are you talking about?

247
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:45,833
It's like I told you, Ao--

248
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:47,625
--doesn't want to come back?

249
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:50,375
Then I'll just have to make him!

250
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:51,000
Come on!

251
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:52,166
Don't you get it?!

252
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:54,708
He's on a US aircraft
carrier right now!

253
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:04,958
I am going to do this,
so just stay out of it!

254
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:07,000
You don't want to
know, remember?!

255
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:09,416
You're wrong!

256
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,416
I didn't ask because
you're my friend.

257
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,625
I thought that's how
it was for you, too!

258
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:14,500
No!

259
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:16,375
I wanted you to want to ask me!

260
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:19,666
Fleur.

261
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:20,291
Elena.

262
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:22,375
Do you copy?

263
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:23,500
Permission to launch.

264
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,166
Go out there and find Ao.

265
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,166
You both want to find out how
he really feels, don't you?

266
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,708
Well, there's only
one way to do that.

267
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:35,583
As fired up as you two are,
you'll make the flight.

268
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:37,458
I'm going.

269
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:39,041
Are you?

270
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,000
I don't know, I--

271
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,000
You're thirteen years old now.

272
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:53,041
Old enough to think
things through as a man

273
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:54,666
and a member of society.

274
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:57,833
Old enough to consider
your responsibilities.

275
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:59,458
Responsibilities?

276
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:01,875
The power of the Quartz Gun
belongs to the world.

277
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:04,416
It shouldn't be wielded
by an individual.

278
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:08,083
I don't know.

279
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,500
Attention all personnel.

280
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:12,541
Two IFOs approaching.

281
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:13,416
What the--?

282
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,166
I repeat: two IFOs approaching.

283
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,375
It's locking on to us!

284
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:48,458
Hold position!

285
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:49,625
We've been targeted.

286
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:54,583
What is this?

287
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:55,291
Ao!

288
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:56,583
Come up on deck!

289
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:57,958
If you don't,
we'll show everyone

290
00:17:58,041 --> 00:18:00,375
what you've got stuffed
under your mattress!

291
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:02,666
I don't think threatening
him is going to help!

292
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:10,458
Fleur, what are you guys doing?!

293
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:12,208
We have a question for you.

294
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:13,083
Get going!

295
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:15,250
You guys shouldn't be here!

296
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:17,000
Blanc is gonna be really pissed!

297
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:18,958
I said we came
to ask a question.

298
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:20,875
Do you really want
to join the Allies?

299
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:22,666
Or do you want to
come back with us?

300
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:23,958
Well, which is it, Ao?

301
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:25,166
Answer me!

302
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,500
I already told the chief.

303
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:27,833
I'm staying.

304
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:29,208
That's what's best for everyone.

305
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:31,666
Ao, we're not asking
about everyone.

306
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:34,000
We want to know how you feel.

307
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:37,708
How I feel.

308
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:39,791
What I want.

309
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:43,916
The truth is I want to go back.

310
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,125
I want to be with
Generation Bleu!

311
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:49,083
Right!

312
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:53,208
See?

313
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:54,458
I knew he didn't
want to stay here.

314
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:55,541
You knew?

315
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:57,333
I'm the one who
figured it out first.

316
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:59,791
The best friends always have
the biggest fights, huh?

317
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:02,041
Stay out of it!

318
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,541
Did you pull a gun
on my mom, too?

319
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:11,333
Generation Bleu doesn't
have a future anymore.

320
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:14,625
Maybe not.

321
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:16,583
But that's where I belong.

322
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:25,916
Alright, you guys!

323
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:26,875
Let's go!

324
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:28,208
Right!

325
00:19:58,791 --> 00:19:59,833
Oh, crap!

326
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:01,375
The Third Engine's
not running anymore!

327
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:02,833
The power of love
was the only thing

328
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:04,416
keeping it going for this long.

329
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,666
Yours was running, too!

330
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,041
Ooh, so you admit it?!

331
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:09,916
We're going to run
out of fuel in no time!

332
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:10,916
That's okay.

333
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,750
I can carry you guys, easy.

334
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:13,375
No way!

335
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:15,083
Not gonna happen!

336
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,750
The Triton.

337
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:29,875
There are reports that
Generation Bleu launched

338
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:33,083
a surprise attack on US Navy
Carrier Ronald Reagan.

339
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:33,958
Are they true?

340
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:35,125
Yes, they are.

341
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:36,541
Given this turn of events,

342
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:38,166
the UN has cancelled
its questioning

343
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:41,166
of company president
Christophe Blanc.

344
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:46,083
The US now considers Generation
Bleu a terrorist group.

345
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:48,000
We are calling for the
UN to enact sanctions

346
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:50,708
and approve the
use of military force.

347
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:00,458
That was some stunt.

348
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:02,166
Picture the look
on the Allies faces'

349
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,666
when Fleur showed up
to take Ao from them.

350
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:06,833
You think this is funny?!

351
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:08,750
It isn't just some
childish prank.

352
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:11,166
You went against
the US military.

353
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,458
Big Blue World can't
support you anymore.

354
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:18,791
Come on, Blanc.

355
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:22,208
It may not be too late if
you start toeing the line now.

356
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:26,125
Ivica said something once.

357
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:27,541
That we adults like to
think we're the ones

358
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:30,666
orchestrating events,
but perhaps we're wrong.

359
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,208
Perhaps the Pied Piper isn't us,

360
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:36,000
but the children
and you know what?

361
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:37,583
I think he's right.

362
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:45,291
It doesn't make sense.

363
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:48,041
They're really not going
to punish us at all?

364
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:49,125
Oh.

365
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:51,083
It's you.

366
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:52,208
Hey, what's up?

367
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:54,291
Good job.

368
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:56,166
You brought Ao back, just
like I expected you would.

369
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,833
Huh?

370
00:22:00,541 --> 00:22:02,083
What do you mean?

371
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:04,000
The time when the Secrets
were the only enemy

372
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:06,208
we had to worry
about fighting is over.

373
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:08,541
In fact, it has been
for a while now.

374
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:11,083
Ever since the day
Eureka appeared.

375
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:14,083
That's why I pissed you off,

376
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,666
knowing your anger would drive
you to do what you needed to.

377
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:19,375
What the hell are
you talking about?

378
00:22:19,458 --> 00:22:21,083
We've finally crossed the line.

379
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:22,833
Things will change.

380
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:29,625
It's beginning.

381
00:22:29,708 --> 00:22:33,375
As of today,
the world is our enemy.

382
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:37,916
To be continued.

383
00:24:12,958 --> 00:24:15,500
Next time on Eureka Seven AO.

384
00:24:15,583 --> 00:24:17,708
The truths in which they
believed are overturned,

385
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:21,041
and Generation Bleu is
labeled the enemy of the world.

386
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:22,625
What will they
choose to protect?

387
00:24:22,708 --> 00:24:24,333
Who will they choose to fight?

388
00:24:24,416 --> 00:24:25,708
As the threat closes in,

389
00:24:25,791 --> 00:24:28,750
will their resolve
waver or stand firm?

390
00:24:28,833 --> 00:24:34,000
Eureka Seven AO, Episode 19:
"the day."

391
00:24:34,083 --> 00:24:36,458
Hear the cry of the
children of the stars.
