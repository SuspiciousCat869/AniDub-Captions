1
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,416
Naru?

2
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,833
Come back.

3
00:01:47,916 --> 00:01:49,000
Please, Naru!

4
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:50,500
At least tell me why!

5
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:53,583
Why would you choose Truth?

6
00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:54,500
Just come back!

7
00:01:54,583 --> 00:01:56,208
It's not too late!

8
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:02,916
What, is this?

9
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:06,666
Naru! Naru!

10
00:02:10,708 --> 00:02:12,125
Wait!

11
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:14,958
Naru! Naru!

12
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:16,458
Naru!

13
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:24,166
Ao! Ao!

14
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:27,541
Can't really say
I approve of this.

15
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:28,666
No, of course.

16
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,083
I'm sorry!

17
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:32,500
I was double checking something
and I guess I dozed off.

18
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:34,625
That's not what I meant.

19
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:36,583
On the contrary
I was talking about

20
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:39,125
all the long hours you've
been pulling lately.

21
00:02:39,208 --> 00:02:42,666
Recovering your strength is
part of a pilot's job, too.

22
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,541
Yeah, I know that but still.

23
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:47,541
Since mine is the only
Third Engine that works,

24
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:50,083
it's important that
I stay on top of things.

25
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:54,750
I have to work to stay strong.

26
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:01,333
What did you do that for?

27
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:03,791
Go home and rest.

28
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:05,958
Our IFOs might be very forgiving

29
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:08,791
but they can't be
piloted by zombies.

30
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:10,166
Yeah, I guess you're right.

31
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:10,708
Hey!

32
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:12,458
Ao!

33
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:13,875
Special delivery!

34
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:16,250
We finally got the
replacement parts in!

35
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:18,875
We've had you making do
with Kyrie's spare parts.

36
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:20,208
But starting with
the next mission,

37
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:23,125
the Nirvash will be
back to its old self.

38
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:26,291
Everyone's counting on you, Ace!

39
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,166
Yeah...

40
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:37,375
What are you doing
up so late, Chief?

41
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:38,833
Pulling some overtime?

42
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:42,458
Yeah there's just something
that's been bothering me.

43
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:44,166
I mean, doesn't it bug you?

44
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,166
This stuff with the Secrets?

45
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,541
Since the operation off
the coast of Ogasawara?

46
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:51,541
It's true the number of
appearances has risen.

47
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:52,958
And that's not all.

48
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:54,916
It started back in Arizona.

49
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,750
Since that mission,
the Secrets have been

50
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:59,291
rapidly learning more
about human beings.

51
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:01,916
And then there's that
radio wave Georg detected.

52
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,541
Has it been...?

53
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:06,791
The unidentified radio wave
registered near Ogaswara

54
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:10,125
has been detected seven more
times during subsequent battles.

55
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,208
Analysis of the wave
is not yet complete,

56
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:15,500
but with each appearance,
the gain on it had increased.

57
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:18,458
Christophe, what do
you think of this business

58
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:20,666
with the Japanese government?

59
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,250
That nonsense they're spouting?

60
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:25,125
That the Scubs are some kind
of inter-dimensional invaders

61
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:27,666
and the Secrets are
acting like white blood cells,

62
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,125
or whatever the analogy was?

63
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:32,166
We have to take it with
a grain of salt, of course,

64
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,750
but the fact is
that some countries

65
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:36,083
are actually taking
their claim seriously.

66
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:38,333
Our people are looking into it.

67
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:40,250
I'll have a report for you soon.

68
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:42,041
I look forward to hearing it.

69
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:44,708
Well, whether it's
the Secrets or the Scub.

70
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:48,041
The side we support will likely
end up being the right one.

71
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:51,708
I have one more question.

72
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:55,083
It's about that strange
Quartz substance

73
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:56,500
that you people
have been extracting

74
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:59,000
from Scubs and squirreling away.

75
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:01,791
I don't believe any of
that was ever found here.

76
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:04,083
Not even when you ran
that little undercover op.

77
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:07,541
You do realize I can easily
go over your head on this.

78
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:09,666
That sounds like
a hollow threat.

79
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,541
Big Blue World is simply
one of our shareholders.

80
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:15,791
Neither of us has
authority over the other.

81
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:21,250
We are conducting a
company-wide health screening.

82
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:23,125
All personnel should
consult the schedule

83
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:25,916
and follow instructions.

84
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:30,458
Anything unusual health-wise?

85
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:31,125
Like dizziness?

86
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:33,083
Or nausea?

87
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,208
Nothing, not really.

88
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:37,666
Well, maybe.

89
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:38,708
Excuse me.

90
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:40,041
It's time for
your shuttle ma'am.

91
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:41,041
Roger.

92
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:41,875
I have to go.

93
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:43,166
Send me the data later.

94
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,291
Sure.

95
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,333
Something wrong?

96
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:48,666
No.

97
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:52,458
It's nothing. I'm fine.

98
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:53,916
It's unusual, huh?

99
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,708
I mean, Mom Hannah
doesn't come down

100
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:57,166
from the space
station very often.

101
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,666
She's here because,
well, you know.

102
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,333
There are lots of
rumors going around.

103
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:03,375
About Ao and how
different he must be

104
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:05,583
because of who his mother is.

105
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:07,958
Eureka's supposed
to be pretty, isn't she?

106
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:10,916
I wonder if that's something
Ao got from her, too.

107
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:13,125
That woman's done nothing

108
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:15,000
but make Ao's
life more difficult.

109
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:17,666
By the way, Elena.

110
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,291
You were acting
weird the other day...

111
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:21,458
...after Eureka showed up.

112
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:22,958
What was that about?

113
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:25,416
That's classified information.

114
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,000
I'm done.

115
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:29,041
They said they want
to see Chloe next.

116
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:30,458
Oh thanks!

117
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:43,750
It's so obvious.

118
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:46,250
This company-wide
screening is a bunch of BS.

119
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:48,541
You just wanted a
chance to examine Ao.

120
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:50,416
What are you talking about?

121
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,916
I'm curious. What did
you discuss with Eureka?

122
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,291
Was it something about how
Trapars are harmful to humans,

123
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:56,708
by any chance?

124
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:57,916
Tell me something.

125
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,875
Eh?

126
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:01,208
Say there's a woman.

127
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:02,833
And she makes a
selfish decision.

128
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:05,333
She has a child, heedless
of the consequences.

129
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:08,541
What woman wouldn't
understand her actions?

130
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:12,500
Even if they changed the world.

131
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:14,541
Changed the world?

132
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:16,666
Are you saying what
I think you're saying?

133
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:58,291
Do you have what I asked for?

134
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:01,708
Here. Sleeping pills,
as ordered.

135
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:06,375
No real side effects,
just don't take too many.

136
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:07,166
What do I owe?

137
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,458
This one is on the house.

138
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:11,750
We island boys
got to stick together.

139
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:13,291
Thanks a lot!

140
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:15,583
I felt weird asking for
the prescription mys--

141
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:19,166
This not being able to
sleep thing isn't physical.

142
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,625
It's what Eureka said, isn't it?

143
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:23,250
About how Secrets
aren't the enemy,

144
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:24,833
like we've always thought.

145
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:27,083
That's what's keeping
you up at night.

146
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,541
You don't always
know everything.

147
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:41,166
Shh!

148
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:46,208
So, onto the reason
you are all here.

149
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:47,500
This is it.

150
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:50,166
The Secret we found
and gave sanctuary to.

151
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,333
Now, are there any questions?

152
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:55,166
I have one!

153
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,083
The secret, is it
a type of machine,

154
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:58,166
or alive?

155
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,708
We've found both organic

156
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:02,500
and inorganic
substances in his body.

157
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,458
Neither infrared
scans nor x-rays

158
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:07,333
have shown anything
about his internal structures.

159
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:10,541
We cannot yet say whether
or not he is a living being.

160
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:13,791
However, unlike other
Secrets we've encountered,

161
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:17,750
he emits a radio wave within
a specific frequency band.

162
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:20,750
We determined that it was
a signal of some sort,

163
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:23,666
and so we sent back a
radio wave of our own.

164
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,208
This is first contact.

165
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:27,750
Did you follow IAA protocol?

166
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:29,041
What's the IAA?

167
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:31,458
The International Academy
of Astronautics.

168
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:33,083
That is correct.

169
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:35,500
We began with information
found in the natural world,

170
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:37,416
such as prime numbers,
after which,

171
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,333
we gradually taught him
the human linguistic system.

172
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:42,000
As a result.

173
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:43,541
Send him the message

174
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:46,208
"Can you understand the signal
we are broadcasting to you?"

175
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,416
That was unexpected.

176
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:04,416
I didn't think the Japanese
would go public so soon.

177
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,125
I wonder what they're up to now.

178
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:08,333
What's their
end game in all this?

179
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:09,833
Maybe it's not a trick.

180
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:11,333
What if their theory
actually is correct?

181
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:12,708
And the Secrets
really are helping

182
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:15,041
to guard this
universe from invaders?

183
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:18,541
No.

184
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,208
That's highly unlikely.

185
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:23,000
Sorry.

186
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:25,208
Blanc here.
What is it?

187
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,541
Go ahead.

188
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:28,958
What?

189
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:38,458
Mr. Han Juno, I believe?

190
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:42,000
I've had the pleasure of meeting
your father a couple of times.

191
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:44,875
What does your government have
to do with the Trapar business?

192
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:48,041
Our country has any
number of financial dealings.

193
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:50,916
Your father's company showed
an interest in doing business,

194
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,791
and we saw no reason
to turn them down.

195
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:02,416
On the US mainland?

196
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:15,125
I am certain we
extracted the Quartz

197
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:17,500
from that Scub Coral
and stabilized it.

198
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:19,666
So how could this be happening?

199
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,333
It is unprecedented.

200
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:23,083
There is not a single
recorded instance

201
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:25,500
of a Scub Coral
reactivating like this.

202
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:27,666
According to the database--

203
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,250
Forget what the database says.

204
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:32,291
We have reports that a Secret
has already appeared on-site.

205
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:36,458
It's simple enough, isn't it?

206
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:38,708
We just go in
and beat the thing.

207
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:52,166
I'm still outside the ZOA, but
I have a visual on the Secret.

208
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,250
Hold on!

209
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:54,375
It's humanoid!

210
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:55,333
Hey, Fleur!

211
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:57,000
Now's our chance.

212
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,416
Elena?

213
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,541
I'm ready!

214
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:06,833
Launching rockets!

215
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:14,625
We did it!

216
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:16,291
Or did we?

217
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:17,083
No way!

218
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:18,291
Not a scratch?

219
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:19,541
Super Alloy?

220
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:22,000
But the real stuff is
made out of zinc alloy.

221
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:22,541
Hey, guys!

222
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:24,083
Cover me, okay?

223
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:24,708
What?

224
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:26,041
Ao wait!

225
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:28,375
Long-range attacks don't
cut it against Secrets.

226
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:31,500
I'm taking the Nirvash in
for close-quarters combat.

227
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:41,500
No way!

228
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:42,666
Those don't look like missiles,

229
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,208
so how are they
homing in on him?

230
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:45,791
Ao move it! Hurry!

231
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:47,458
What do you think I'm doing?

232
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:51,666
Damn!

233
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,375
I'm not going to die that easy!

234
00:12:58,375 --> 00:12:59,375
Ao was shot down?

235
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:00,541
I hope he's okay.

236
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:02,500
They say that his
life isn't in danger.

237
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:03,750
Pied Piper will rescue him

238
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:05,416
while we go in and
finish the mission.

239
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,291
This whole thing is just crazy.

240
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:11,750
We've never seen a plant
become active again like this.

241
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,833
Top priority goes to
protecting the plant.

242
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:18,083
We'll do what we can to
rescue the wounded later.

243
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:19,875
What are you doing?

244
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:21,791
No unauthorized personnel!

245
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:24,500
I hear that Ao and the
Nirvash were shot down.

246
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:26,333
If you don't have enough
people to retrieve him,

247
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:29,958
the Gazelle Agency will
gladly take the contract.

248
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:32,541
He's right, we're shorthanded.

249
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:33,916
Accept his offer.

250
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,250
Got it?

251
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:44,750
Great!

252
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:46,166
So what now?

253
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:50,541
You bastard!

254
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:52,416
Be careful how you approach it.

255
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,625
Once it locks on you
won't be able to shake it.

256
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,333
Wait what do you mean?

257
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:58,583
So is that it?

258
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:01,083
It homed in on the
Nirvash and took it down?

259
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,000
Ao! Ao!

260
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:12,208
This is the Triton, Ao.

261
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:13,458
Do you copy?

262
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:14,958
Testing! Testing!

263
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:16,250
This is the Rakan.

264
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:18,166
I've retrieved the pilot.

265
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:19,666
Please deal with the IFO.

266
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,458
Over!

267
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:22,458
It's that punk.

268
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:23,958
What is he doing here?

269
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:27,833
That's a surprise.
You're a good pilot.

270
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:29,541
Trying' to fly, here!

271
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:42,291
Five against one,

272
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:45,291
and we still aren't
making any headway.

273
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:46,541
A lot of calls are coming in.

274
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:48,166
From various countries.

275
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:50,875
Apparently, plants are
reactivating all over the world.

276
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:07,833
Impossible!

277
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:08,958
The plant is active again?

278
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,000
That can't be right!

279
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:12,666
My call won't go through!

280
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,125
We are in the process
of setting up a landline.

281
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:17,041
Please remain calm.

282
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:19,375
We're doing all that we can.

283
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:32,416
Demands are coming in from
every corner of the Earth.

284
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,541
We're going to have to split up

285
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:35,333
to deal with any
Secrets that appear.

286
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:37,541
That's the only way
we can handle them all.

287
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:39,166
Against these things?

288
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,916
We'll run the children ragged!

289
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,541
I don't see any other
option at this point, do you?

290
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:45,708
We have no idea how they're
reactivating themselves,

291
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:49,250
but every Scub has a Quartz,
so we need to act fast.

292
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:50,541
Okay?

293
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:01,041
Where am I?

294
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:09,166
Chloe.

295
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:16,500
We've traded places, huh?

296
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:18,083
What about the Nirvash?

297
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:20,083
Have I screwed things up again?

298
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:21,583
Kind of.

299
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:24,166
That's becoming a
habit of yours, isn't it.

300
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,833
I'm sorry.

301
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:30,041
Tell me something.

302
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:33,750
The Secrets are the
enemy, aren't they?

303
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:35,291
Huh?

304
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:37,791
They must be, right?

305
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:39,500
The enemy.

306
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:41,541
Wish I knew how to answer that.

307
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,166
What are you guys
sitting in the hall for?

308
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,166
Shh!

309
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:59,125
You see?

310
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:00,750
A Coral plant.

311
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:03,916
It's all lit up.

312
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,333
It's in Norway.

313
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:07,166
Specifically the
Vesterålen Islands.

314
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:10,291
It's where Maeve and
I lived before becoming pilots.

315
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:13,916
We're originally from Ireland,

316
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,958
but our family emigrated in
order to work at the plant.

317
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:20,416
We moved there not
long after I was born.

318
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,916
Where are your mother
and father now?

319
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,125
They still live in Norway.

320
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:31,583
I'm so scared I'm going
to lose them, too.

321
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:33,250
Like we lost Bruno.

322
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:37,750
I have to protect them.

323
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:40,375
No matter what,
I have to keep them safe.

324
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:46,958
I'm sorry, but we're
being scrambled.

325
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:48,250
You ready?

326
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:05,416
I've been thinking
about something.

327
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,666
Seems like this is all
connected to your mom.

328
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:11,708
It all started when multiple
Eurekas began showing up.

329
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,958
Weird things just
keep on happening.

330
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:16,166
Plants reactivating,
Naru going crazy.

331
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,375
That's ridiculous.

332
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:18,333
Think about it!

333
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:20,541
I don't need to.

334
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:22,916
There's no way that can be true.

335
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:38,166
Another Secret's appeared.

336
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,583
There are just too many.

337
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:42,000
We'd have a chance,

338
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:45,416
if there was a way to
gather them all in one place.

339
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,708
We can use me as bait.

340
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:51,208
It came after Nirvash
last time, didn't it?

341
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:52,208
You can't!

342
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:53,625
But there was more
than one Nirvash

343
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:55,750
involved in that
battle, remember?

344
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:57,375
Eureka isn't here now.

345
00:18:57,458 --> 00:18:59,000
It won't work.

346
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:00,916
That's enough
arguing, you three!

347
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,750
Standby in your cockpits
'til we choose a plan of action.

348
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:04,791
But Chief?

349
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:05,416
Yes, sir.

350
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,791
We're going.

351
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:07,708
Hold on a sec!

352
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:08,458
Quit squirming.

353
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:09,291
Let me go!

354
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:10,458
That's enough, Ao.

355
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:16,916
We are in position.

356
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,583
We will use my
auto-translation algorithm.

357
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:21,083
That should make it possible

358
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:23,833
to analyze the radio wave
being sent out by the Secret.

359
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:27,500
We can then transfer the
data back to headquarters.

360
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,833
We're all counting
on you, Georg.

361
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:32,708
What the hell are
you two doing here?

362
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:40,250
This guy?

363
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:43,500
He was in the
auditorium earlier.

364
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:46,000
Boys.

365
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:49,083
Signal has been captured.

366
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:54,791
Contact!

367
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:55,625
Signal.

368
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:56,875
Analyze.

369
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:59,041
Respond!

370
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:02,041
Hey that didn't sound good.

371
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:04,041
You all right?

372
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,291
Yes, I am fine.

373
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:07,541
Who are you?

374
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,125
My name's Han Juno.

375
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:11,666
I work with Generation Bleu.

376
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:15,875
I am what you and your
kind refer to as a Secret.

377
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,500
Did the bastards hack us?

378
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:21,625
You're a Secret?

379
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:23,083
Tell us, what are you?

380
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:24,125
Where are you from?

381
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:26,083
Who or what created you?

382
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:27,916
I was created in
order to eliminate

383
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,875
unwelcome foreign
bodies from this universe.

384
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:33,083
There is no "where" or "who."

385
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:36,208
I am a natural
product of evolution.

386
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:39,833
Then explain what's
happening now.

387
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:42,458
If you're really a
Secret, you should know.

388
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:45,125
Why are Scubs across the
globe becoming active again?

389
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:46,875
I will tell you.

390
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:49,625
Ten years ago, a giant
Quartz disappeared

391
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:53,916
from the Scub near the
island that you call Okinawa.

392
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:55,416
What do you suppose has happened

393
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,708
to the Quartz over
the last ten years?

394
00:20:57,791 --> 00:20:58,875
We get it.

395
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:00,583
Now, leave the Scubs to us.

396
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:02,875
We cannot do that.

397
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:05,916
Our sole purpose is to
eliminate the Scub Corals.

398
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,833
As long as the Scubs continue
to appear in this universe,

399
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:11,875
we will continue to
pursue and destroy them.

400
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:13,166
They have no choice.

401
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,125
The Secrets appear
automatically when something

402
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:17,250
from another universe
invades this one.

403
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:19,666
If that's truly
the case, I wonder.

404
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,166
Don't get any stupid ideas.

405
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:24,458
Big Blue World will want to
be kept in the loop on this.

406
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:29,041
Get me the
US Secretary of State!

407
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:30,750
Tell him it's urgent.

408
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,708
But there's no other way!

409
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:35,041
What are you going to do?

410
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:36,666
Disobey orders?

411
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:40,541
You wanted to discuss
something, Christophe?

412
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:43,708
We don't have much time,
so I'll cut to the chase.

413
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:47,250
We know why Scubs everywhere
are becoming active again.

414
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:49,208
It has to do with the
substance called Quartz,

415
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:51,583
about which you were
inquiring the other day.

416
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:52,500
That's my dad.

417
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:54,208
What's he saying?

418
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:55,375
Shut down communications!

419
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:56,750
Immediately!

420
00:21:56,833 --> 00:21:58,791
We know why the Secrets appear.

421
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:01,625
Their objective is the
Quartz's destruction.

422
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:05,041
That means we can get
them all in one place.

423
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:08,500
We simply need a massive amount
of Quartz to lure them in.

424
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:11,208
An amount greater than
we've ever seen before.

425
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:13,708
And where do you suppose that
we can find so much Quartz?

426
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:14,666
That's enough!

427
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:15,750
Keep quiet, Blanc!

428
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:18,166
Generation Bleu has the answer.

429
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:20,458
For years, we have worked
in absolute secrecy

430
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:23,875
to collect the Quartz from
every Scub we have stabilized.

431
00:22:23,958 --> 00:22:27,750
We have stored them in a
secure location, in space.

432
00:22:27,833 --> 00:22:29,000
And we will now use that Quartz

433
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:32,458
to wipe out every single
Secret in this world!

434
00:22:33,583 --> 00:22:35,916
It's time to end this!

435
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:38,041
To be continued!

436
00:24:12,875 --> 00:24:15,625
Next time on Eureka Seven AO.

437
00:24:15,708 --> 00:24:18,125
Operation Polaris
is set into motion.

438
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:20,291
Despite his exhaustion
and uncertainty,

439
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:22,750
Ao moves to the
forefront of the struggle.

440
00:24:22,833 --> 00:24:24,333
When a difficult
decision must be made,

441
00:24:24,416 --> 00:24:25,875
what will the boy choose?

442
00:24:25,958 --> 00:24:28,458
And what consequences
will he face?

443
00:24:28,541 --> 00:24:34,000
Eureka Seven AO, Episode 16.
"next phase."

444
00:24:34,083 --> 00:24:36,250
Hear the cry of the
children of the stars.
