1
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:46,500
Yeah, I know.

2
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:49,083
The things I love.

3
00:01:49,166 --> 00:01:52,541
I love them because they
will always be out of reach.

4
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:09,666
In the end, it doesn't matter.

5
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,625
However far I go,
I'll be under the same sky.

6
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:17,250
What the hell is happening?

7
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:19,125
Who's attacking us now?

8
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,500
This world is wrong,
very deeply wrong.

9
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:29,041
So, it's you, Truth.

10
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:29,750
But why?

11
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:30,875
And how?

12
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:33,125
Have you been inside
the Abe all along?

13
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:36,458
Actually, you'll find
I exist in various places,

14
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:37,958
but this screwed
up world of yours

15
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:39,916
is not the one
in which I belong.

16
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,458
I know you're
just another Secret.

17
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:46,166
I came from a different
place, far away from here.

18
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,750
In that place, there
are no Scub Corals.

19
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:50,833
Nor are there Secrets.

20
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:53,125
Man himself produces
the energy needed

21
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:56,375
to illuminate the dark
corners of the world.

22
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:05,125
Shoot him!

23
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:06,500
Fire now!

24
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:20,583
Did we get him?

25
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:31,750
Did we get him?

26
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:33,750
And they lived
happily ever after.

27
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:35,083
Now, um.

28
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:36,625
What's the best way
to describe all this

29
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:38,416
when I report to Colonel Tanaka?

30
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,583
Don't just sit there!

31
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:40,875
Do something!

32
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:42,166
I'm sorry, sir!

33
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:43,541
What was that?

34
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,250
The Abe's hit!

35
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:51,500
Where'd he come from?!

36
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:52,500
It's Truth, alright.

37
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:53,583
But how?!

38
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:56,125
He shouldn't be here!

39
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:06,916
You guys! Hurry!

40
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,125
Run!

41
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:11,958
Maggie!

42
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:13,291
Elena!

43
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:21,583
Is this what you're after?

44
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:35,041
My dad said something
before he died.

45
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:37,500
That Truth is a Secret.

46
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:39,041
What do you know about him?

47
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:40,916
Your government was
working in collaboration

48
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,625
with him at one point, right?

49
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:44,625
That wasn't an
official relationship.

50
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:46,833
Just something Nakamura
pursued on his own.

51
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:49,000
Don't worry about
covering your ass.

52
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:51,333
What can you tell us
about Truth's objective?

53
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:52,541
You are partially correct.

54
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:55,333
He was, indeed, a Secret once.

55
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:56,791
What about the rest of it?

56
00:04:56,875 --> 00:04:59,583
Wasn't he Johansson's
adopted son, also?

57
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,166
Johansson's son?

58
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:02,208
Things have changed.

59
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:04,000
Truth is ill now.

60
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,125
Come on, Truth!

61
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:14,333
Why can't you just tell
me what you're doing here?

62
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,000
You still working with Japan?

63
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:21,083
If that's the case,
we're on the same side now.

64
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:22,583
Are you working
with the Secrets?

65
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:24,666
Because so are we.

66
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,166
After what you did
to Fleur's father.

67
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,416
What the hell's your game?!

68
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,500
None of it makes sense, Truth!

69
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:33,958
It's simple, Ao Fukai.

70
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:35,208
I'm your enemy.

71
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:35,750
Oh, yeah?!

72
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:37,041
Well.

73
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:44,500
What the hell?

74
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,750
Truth is cloaked in a higher
concentration than normal.

75
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:58,666
You could say he's
surrounded by a Trapar storm,

76
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,708
or heavy swells, if you like.

77
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:02,958
They cannot be ridden.

78
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:04,291
But what about Ao?

79
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:06,375
He can see the Trapar waves.

80
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:08,583
It will be impossible
with his Nirvash.

81
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:10,958
Because it has no soul.

82
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:12,375
It's a machine.

83
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:13,875
Why would it?

84
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:20,625
I don't know what's happening!

85
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:21,833
I have no control!

86
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:22,958
Elena!

87
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:26,541
It's no use.

88
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:28,500
I can't read the
flow of the Trapars.

89
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,625
Naru?

90
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:43,708
Is she okay?

91
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:45,541
What's going on?

92
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:47,541
Is it her illness?

93
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:50,791
I don't get it.

94
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:52,208
What's happening?

95
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:54,250
I didn't think this Coral plant
had become active again.

96
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:09,583
The giant.

97
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:36,708
That's right.

98
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:38,541
The Quartz itself
doesn't matter.

99
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:41,041
We just have to
destroy the Scub Corals.

100
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:43,500
That's the only thing we
have to worry about, Truth.

101
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:46,541
Calculate his likely course.

102
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:48,291
We'll be there to greet him.

103
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:01,791
How'd he get here?

104
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:03,208
Does this mean
that the Scub Corals

105
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:05,416
are connected to
each other somehow?

106
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,000
Or is it just Ao?

107
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:09,750
Can he do this because
he is Eureka's child?

108
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:21,625
So.

109
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:23,291
How about some lunch?

110
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,666
Thanks for helping
with the rescue.

111
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:42,708
We're very grateful

112
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:44,458
It was nothing.

113
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:46,833
I don't understand
what this report's saying!

114
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:47,916
What is this supposed to mean?

115
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,625
What's happened
to our IFO pilots?

116
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:57,541
Um, I... It is with
much embarrassment,

117
00:08:57,625 --> 00:09:00,250
but I have returned,
or something like that.

118
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:03,291
The acting CEO approved
your reinstatement.

119
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:04,416
At ease.

120
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,875
So, where's Ao?

121
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:07,958
It seems he popped up on Iwato.

122
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:09,625
Iwato Island, huh?

123
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:11,833
Isn't that where
his girlfriend is?

124
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:13,250
They aren't together.

125
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:16,208
He said they were just friends
from childhood remember?

126
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:29,208
Truth is on the move.

127
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:31,458
He's headed for the
Coral plant in Okinawa.

128
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:33,625
The location of the
world's largest Quartz.

129
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:37,125
So that means Truth really is
a Secret, like my dad suspected.

130
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:39,541
That is incorrect.

131
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:52,875
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

132
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:54,750
What did you do to the Kyrie?!

133
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:56,208
Long time, no see, Elena.

134
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:57,375
What do you think
of the new part?

135
00:09:57,458 --> 00:09:58,125
Nice, huh?

136
00:09:58,208 --> 00:09:58,875
Take it off!

137
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:00,166
It's gotta go!

138
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,666
Seriously!

139
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:04,458
Or are we going for a three-way
with Nirvash and Alleluia?

140
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:05,708
What next?

141
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:06,541
Are you gonna put a lion
or tiger on the chest?!

142
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:08,333
As we said, Truth is ill.

143
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:12,291
He is no longer a Secret and
has not been for ten years.

144
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:13,458
I'm talking!

145
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:16,416
If he was one of you,
how can he be ill?

146
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,958
You and your kind
appear automatically

147
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:20,291
when foreign bodies
invade this universe.

148
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:22,666
Like white blood cells
fighting an infection, right?

149
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:23,958
What if he was taken in

150
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:26,958
by the foreign body
instead of destroying it?

151
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:30,416
A Coral Carrier.

152
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,958
What?

153
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:33,125
It's the Allies.

154
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:34,750
They were cultivating IFO pilots

155
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:37,625
who had been parasitized
by the Scub Corals.

156
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:41,041
Like those cases that Mom
Hannah reported a while ago?

157
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:42,250
Damn Stanley.

158
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:44,333
He must have known
about it all along.

159
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:45,791
Like ocean coral,

160
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:49,250
Scub Corals are collectives
of microscopic organisms.

161
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:51,125
When they
encounter intelligent life,

162
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:52,791
they occasionally
assimilate the target

163
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:55,875
in an attempt to
establish communication.

164
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:58,000
What do you mean
by "assimilate"?

165
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:00,500
Do their hosts stop
being human anymore?

166
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:03,250
Ten years ago, Truth
appeared as a Secret in order

167
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:07,500
to trigger a fusion blast and
destroy the Scub.

168
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:10,708
When the Quartz
disappeared right

169
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:14,375
before his eyes, the Secret was
thrown into confusion.

170
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:17,833
He had come, as all Secrets
do, to annihilate the Quartz.

171
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:21,583
but now his reason for
being had vanished.

172
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:25,708
Left alone, his rampage
would have continued forever.

173
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:28,875
But the Scub Coral became
one with the confused Secret

174
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:32,750
and thus made it possible for
him to go on living.

175
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:35,708
That's why Truth is
tormented by the belief

176
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:37,125
that the true
world is a place

177
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:39,208
in which Scub Corals
don't exist,

178
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:41,750
because that's what he
was sent here to create.

179
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,791
There's no time
to be doing this.

180
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:58,208
I want you to
stop fighting Truth.

181
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:00,708
I wonder what those two
are talking about in there.

182
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:02,958
Naru's been keeping strange
company lately.

183
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:05,250
Dangerous people who're
possessed by the Scubs.

184
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:07,916
Naru's a little sick,
she's not possessed.

185
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,833
You heard what the
folks downstairs said.

186
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:12,708
That the disease
Naru has is spreading.

187
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:14,916
This Scub sickness
is contagious.

188
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,583
Before he left, you
treated Ao like an outsider.

189
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:19,416
Now you've moved on to Naru?

190
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,375
He's only tellin'
the truth, isn't he?

191
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:23,666
There are tons of those
infected people here.

192
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,541
They've banded together and
surrounded the Coral plant.

193
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:29,125
That stuff they say about the
Scubs singing.

194
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:30,708
It's just plain creepy.

195
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,000
You draw a line between them

196
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:33,708
and you because
of your differences,

197
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:36,416
and then you call
it independence.

198
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:44,041
You know... Never mind.

199
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:45,416
No, what is it?

200
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,583
Well, it's just that.

201
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:48,958
You've changed.

202
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:50,458
You're different, somehow.

203
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:53,125
Like those, uh,
new ears of yours.

204
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:56,250
What, these?

205
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:57,958
They're clip-ons?

206
00:12:58,041 --> 00:13:00,875
Is that the kind of stuff
Truth likes, or something?

207
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:03,291
'Cause that's how
it works, right?

208
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:05,333
Everyone says girls
change their look depending

209
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:06,458
on the guy they're with.

210
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:07,666
Huh?

211
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,000
It makes sense.

212
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:11,791
If you love Truth, then
I guess you would change--

213
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:14,333
Honestly!

214
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:16,833
Is that what you've been
thinking this entire time?!

215
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:18,583
Well, answer me!

216
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:20,500
Is that seriously
what you think?!

217
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:22,750
So, anyway, um.

218
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:25,750
Remember how I told you
about meeting my mom?

219
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:26,833
You do?

220
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:27,833
Well, it turns out
that I might have

221
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:30,375
an older sister, and, you know.

222
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:32,000
We've known each
other for like, ever,

223
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:34,625
and you've been looking
out for me since I was little.

224
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:38,166
So I got to thinking that you
were kind of like my big sister.

225
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,083
Your sister?

226
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:41,291
Your sister?!

227
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:44,166
Uh... Why do you look so mad?

228
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,500
Oh. Mom, what's up?

229
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:46,041
Mom?!

230
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:46,833
Now, it's Mom!

231
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:47,541
No!

232
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:48,791
I wasn't talking to you.

233
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:50,041
Hey, Ao.

234
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:51,541
Just wanted to tell you
we're going after Truth.

235
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:54,291
It's a joint operation
with the Triton.

236
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,500
But we're not on the
same side anymore.

237
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:58,416
You guys are with
the Allied Forces now.

238
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,625
It was kind of a
delicate situation.

239
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:01,916
We had to say we were.

240
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,750
Well, Ao.

241
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:04,958
What are you going to do?

242
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:05,708
I'm coming with you!

243
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:07,125
Hold on, Ao.

244
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:10,458
You're a descendent of
Scub Corals as well as humans.

245
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:13,000
Something you and
Truth have in common.

246
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:30,875
What's happening?

247
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:33,791
This isn't how
it's supposed to go.

248
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:35,000
What the hell is this?

249
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,791
Big Blue World
guaranteed that is was safe!

250
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:39,166
We did experiments!

251
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,416
The subjects showed
no abnormalities!

252
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,750
It's not our doing!

253
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:44,625
It's all because of Truth!

254
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:46,166
What did that bastard do?!

255
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:50,250
Truth has fused with an IFO
Blanc referred to as the Canon.

256
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:51,625
According to our observations,

257
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:53,208
the IFO creates a space

258
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:57,166
with extremely high Trapar
concentrations around itself.

259
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:59,375
And when Trapar
concentrations are high,

260
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:02,458
things run amok inside
Coral Carriers' bodies.

261
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:04,375
The Scub Coral kills its host.

262
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:05,708
No, you're wrong.

263
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:07,833
In Okinawa, there
are many Carriers

264
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:10,000
who are unaware
of their condition.

265
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:11,833
Just like you used to be.

266
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:13,375
They're in danger.

267
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:14,875
Truth's IFO is headed here,

268
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:17,416
and when it arrives,
they're all going to die.

269
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,666
You're lying!

270
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,666
The Scubs don't enter
our bodies to hurt us!

271
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:23,625
They do it to make humans
better and stronger than before!

272
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:26,000
No, Naru.

273
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:28,791
I spent most of my life
thinking that I was sick,

274
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:30,500
but I wasn't really.

275
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:33,708
It was actually a gift
from the Scub Corals,

276
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:37,416
an invisible set of wings
they planted inside me.

277
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:41,125
The whole world would fill
with Trapars and one day.

278
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:43,583
I would fly like you, Ao.

279
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:45,750
Thanks to the Scubs.

280
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:53,291
I'm sorry, humans and
Scub Corals are too different.

281
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:55,208
There it is.

282
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:57,250
Another line drawn.

283
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:58,833
You're not a Carrier, Ao.

284
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:02,208
but there's no way of knowing if
it will affect your body, too.

285
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,750
Yes, I see.

286
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:09,041
Let us and Ivica's
team take care of it.

287
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:10,208
The Secrets have promised

288
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:12,166
to give us their
assistance, as well.

289
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:15,541
Whatever the cost,
we will stop them.

290
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:38,666
Well.

291
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:41,083
I guess you haven't
really changed that much.

292
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,208
Now what are you talking about?

293
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:44,833
When we were little,
you always protected me

294
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:47,625
from people who treated
me like an outsider,

295
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:51,125
and if the whole world
was filled with Scub Corals,

296
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:55,583
well, then I really wouldn't
be an outsider anymore, would I?

297
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:58,083
I don't know if
you realize it or not,

298
00:16:58,166 --> 00:17:00,708
but I haven't really
changed, either.

299
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:06,666
I'm sorry.

300
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,625
But I have to go.

301
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:09,458
Don't you get it?

302
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:11,125
You can't win against Truth.

303
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:13,041
Your Nirvash has no Archetype.

304
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:14,875
Without one, you can't beat him.

305
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:16,375
Arche--what?

306
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:17,958
Sorry, I don't get it.

307
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:20,166
Is that some kinda big boat?

308
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,541
Idiot.

309
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,041
So, when are they gonna kiss?

310
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:26,083
They'd better get on with it.

311
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:53,333
Come. Now.

312
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:55,083
Come, Truth.

313
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:57,208
Ten years ago the
Japanese government believed

314
00:17:57,291 --> 00:17:59,416
that Trapar mining
was dangerous,

315
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,958
and tried to shut down
the Coral plant in Okinawa

316
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:04,791
by placing it under the
control of the Cabinet Office.

317
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:07,375
But Okinawa rebelled against
Japan and with the help

318
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:10,791
of the United States military
won their independence,

319
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:12,625
and look where that got them.

320
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:20,291
This is it.

321
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:22,708
The miserable end
you people chose.

322
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:25,583
How do you like it?

323
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:27,833
Is it everything you
hoped it would be?

324
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,125
Those are IFOs.

325
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:38,708
It looks like Team Harlequin!

326
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,458
Liu.

327
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:45,208
Lerato.

328
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,166
Rajkumar.

329
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,541
Don't let him get any farther.

330
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:49,791
He may be planning to
trigger a fusion blast.

331
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:51,250
Normally, I'd say
it was convenient

332
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:52,708
if he blew himself up.

333
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:54,416
But if the explosion
happens here,

334
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,791
the impact will be felt
from Okinawa to Taiwan.

335
00:18:57,875 --> 00:18:59,125
And let's not forget
how he made it out

336
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:01,125
of the Generation Bleu basement.

337
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:03,875
It's possible that even if
he triggers a fusion blast,

338
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:05,500
he can use his
Scub Coral powers

339
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:08,000
to regenerate
after the explosion.

340
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:09,416
If that's true--

341
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,625
If that's true, the only thing
we can do is have faith.

342
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:40,666
Well, somebody's earned a
spanking, wouldn't you say?

343
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,083
Now's not the time!

344
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:44,583
It doesn't matter how
the disease eats at you,

345
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:46,750
or how you alter
your appearance.

346
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:49,166
It does not change the
fact that you are a Secret.

347
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:52,875
This again.

348
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:54,666
You're saying I'm a Secret.

349
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,583
You do not think so?

350
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:58,458
No, I don't.

351
00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:02,125
I don't share your interest
in destroying Scub Corals.

352
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:05,708
What I want to
destroy is the world.

353
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:08,083
In that case,
are you one of them?

354
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:09,958
One of the invading Scub Corals?

355
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:11,000
No.

356
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:12,791
I'm not one of those, either.

357
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:13,958
Very well.

358
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:15,458
Then, are you a human?

359
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:17,000
The son of Johansson?

360
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:20,875
No. No. No.

361
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:22,166
Don't you see?

362
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:24,125
I'm not any of those.

363
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:26,250
Then what do you claim to be?

364
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:40,333
Ohh, a body blow!

365
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:41,333
That one hurt!

366
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:42,125
Quick, Elena.

367
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:43,291
Get back!

368
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:46,166
I'm sorry, Fleur,
I can't talk right now.

369
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,666
I'm busy, here!

370
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,625
Ready main guns!

371
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:52,625
Chief, look!

372
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:04,458
Truth.

373
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:06,000
This is it.

374
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:08,083
It's time to finish this.

375
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,500
Don't you see?

376
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:12,166
I'm not anybody.

377
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:14,166
I am just Truth.

378
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,291
The only one there is!

379
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:20,333
This place is a wasteland, too.

380
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:30,000
No matter how far
I go, it's the same.

381
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:34,750
The Scub Corals encountered
the defense mechanism,

382
00:22:34,833 --> 00:22:38,166
and this planet perished.

383
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,416
I count seven Light Pillars.

384
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,041
It's a Seven Swell!

385
00:22:53,208 --> 00:22:54,833
Nirvash!

386
00:23:12,041 --> 00:23:13,833
We're finally going, Nirvash.

387
00:23:13,916 --> 00:23:15,958
Eureka is calling to us.

388
00:23:21,416 --> 00:23:22,791
At last.

389
00:23:22,875 --> 00:23:25,916
After all this time, we'll
be able to put an end to it.

390
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,458
I'm coming for you, Eureka.

391
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:15,875
Next time on Eureka Seven AO.

392
00:24:15,958 --> 00:24:18,916
Truth is consumed
by that which is true.

393
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
While he is liberated
from his grief,

394
00:24:21,083 --> 00:24:23,416
Ao is tormented by reality.

395
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,916
History is revised once more.

396
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,416
How close to home
will it hit this time?

397
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:33,958
Eureka Seven AO, Episode 23:
"Renton Thurston."

398
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:36,375
Hear the cry of the
children of the stars.
