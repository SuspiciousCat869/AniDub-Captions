1
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:53,208
A world reliant on
Trapars for survival.

2
00:01:53,291 --> 00:01:54,791
Doomed from the start.

3
00:01:57,041 --> 00:01:57,833
Hey!

4
00:01:57,916 --> 00:01:58,666
What do you think you're doing?!

5
00:02:01,375 --> 00:02:03,458
Are you happy, Nakamura?

6
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:04,458
Let me go.

7
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:05,333
Why are you guys here?

8
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:06,125
Are you happy?!

9
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:08,708
Answer the question!

10
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:10,833
This what you hoped for?

11
00:02:10,916 --> 00:02:12,416
I wasn't a fan of how reliant

12
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,958
on the Trapar business
Okinawa became,

13
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:17,458
but I never wanted
something like this to happen.

14
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:19,750
What did independence
mean to them?

15
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:21,791
Simply not becoming Japanese?

16
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,375
And don't tell me they were
hoping to ally with the Secrets,

17
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:28,458
or go on some kind of
crusade to protect the Scubs.

18
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:29,916
It was a toy to them.

19
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,458
Independence was
something they could gain

20
00:02:31,541 --> 00:02:34,083
if only they threw
enough tantrums.

21
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,375
Uh, Gazelle.

22
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:37,375
You know.

23
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:38,916
That sounds a lot like you.

24
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,708
Shut up!

25
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:42,250
It isn't the same thing.

26
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,791
Look, I don't know
how the military works.

27
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:47,333
But in the business world,

28
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:50,125
we don't lay down arms just
because a common enemy appears.

29
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:51,458
That would be ridiculous.

30
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:54,250
We can sway public opinion
with a PR campaign

31
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:57,541
that depicts Truth as
the Secrets' accomplice.

32
00:02:57,625 --> 00:02:59,375
A truce is ridiculous, huh?

33
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:01,708
You may not know this about us,

34
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:04,625
but soldiers are the
biggest romantics there are.

35
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:06,083
We fight when we must

36
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:08,958
but nobody wants peace in
this world more than we do.

37
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:12,375
The experiment with the Coral
Carriers ran into some problems,

38
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:14,125
I know, but is that
a good enough reason

39
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:15,166
to surrender to the Secrets?

40
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,833
You don't get it, Stanley.

41
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:18,500
You really don't.

42
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:22,416
Why are you so surprised?

43
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,500
Is it really so strange
that negotiations

44
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:26,708
with the US government
went smoothly?

45
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:28,500
Secret, I don't understand.

46
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,916
We thought you were
destroyed in the battle.

47
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,958
I cannot be so easily killed.

48
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:37,750
My being has already
assimilated as Georg.

49
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:40,416
There are countless
iterations of me.

50
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:46,875
No ammo?!

51
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:47,708
Ao!

52
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:48,750
Damn.

53
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:51,875
Fleur?!

54
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:56,750
What are you doing, Ao?

55
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:58,625
Return fire, already!

56
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:04,250
Is firing this thing
my only choice?

57
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:09,125
Was that--?

58
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:14,791
You take care of Truth.

59
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:17,708
I'm going to find out
who the new arrival is.

60
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:21,083
What the hell are
you doing here?

61
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:23,416
And what do you want with Ao?!

62
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:39,458
Elena!

63
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:40,625
Oh, no!

64
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,291
Noooo!

65
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:50,333
At least tell me why, Naru!

66
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:52,083
Why are you taking his side?!

67
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:55,250
Because you have no
chance of defeating Truth.

68
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:58,208
For the same reason you
are no match for my Nirvash.

69
00:04:58,291 --> 00:04:59,875
You have no Archetype.

70
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:00,958
So what?

71
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:02,625
What the hell is
this Archetype thing?

72
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:06,708
Whoa, those are Trapars.

73
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:08,916
This Nirvash is a living being.

74
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,375
Inside him there
is an Archetype.

75
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:14,041
Archetypes are
actually Coralians.

76
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:15,208
Yours is a machine.

77
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:16,541
Nothing more.

78
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:19,958
Naru!

79
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:23,708
A new era is coming, Ao.

80
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:25,833
One heralded by Scub Corals.

81
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:29,166
In this new world,
nobody will ever suffer.

82
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,375
You see?

83
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:32,541
That's the future we
should be fighting for.

84
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:35,875
It's the Scub Corals
versus the Secrets.

85
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:37,958
Does it have to
be one or the other?

86
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:46,708
Fleur! Behind us!

87
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:48,625
What is it?

88
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:50,833
Wait, is that?

89
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:53,375
No way.

90
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:54,500
I thought Harlequin had switched

91
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:57,041
their allegiance to
the Allied Forces!

92
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:58,291
The Allied Forces

93
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:01,083
have entered into peace
negotiations with Japan.

94
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:03,375
Coral Carriers are
being hospitalized

95
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:05,458
with hyper-acute symptoms.

96
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:07,708
A number of countries are
responding to this threat

97
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:11,416
by making the area around
Coral plants off-limits.

98
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,000
Coral Carriers?

99
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:14,041
Like Naru?!

100
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:17,125
What's going to happen to her?

101
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:19,875
We think she may
be in danger, as well.

102
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,416
You, too, Ao.

103
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,333
No!

104
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:25,000
Wait, Ao!

105
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:30,583
Danger or not,
we have no choice.

106
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:33,250
The world is depending on you.

107
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:35,333
If Ao comes out
of this the winner.

108
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:37,541
If Nirvash defeats Truth,
the world will have

109
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:39,958
to acknowledge that
we were in the right,

110
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:42,833
and our exile would be over.

111
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,250
It may be no more
than a fleeting peace.

112
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:49,291
But even that is
better than war.

113
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:50,791
The year 1096.

114
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:52,875
The First Crusade is launched.

115
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:54,000
The year 1206.

116
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:57,291
I understand how this must feel.

117
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:00,750
To be rejected by everyone,
even the Secrets.

118
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:02,958
Only I know the truth about you.

119
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:06,375
Only I know who you really are.

120
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:13,333
I know because
you're the same as me.

121
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:17,250
Your life is preserved
by the Scub Corals.

122
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:21,083
You began as a Secret, but
the Scubs got into your body.

123
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:23,958
They became an
inseparable part of your being.

124
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:25,916
Hey, do you remember?

125
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,500
All the way back to
when we first met?

126
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:30,416
Each of us was able
to breathe more easily

127
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,416
because of the Trapars
the other exhaled.

128
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,833
Since that discovery,

129
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:38,083
we've dedicated ourselves
to fighting for the Scubs.

130
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:04,125
Truth.

131
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:06,666
The powers you have
as a Secret will help us.

132
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:09,375
You don't need to deny them.

133
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:10,458
The year 1911.

134
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:12,541
The Xinhai Rebellion
erupts in China.

135
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:26,583
The year 1945.

136
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:28,500
The Manhattan Project.

137
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:30,000
Hiroshima.

138
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:31,916
Nagasaki.

139
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,125
That is the correct
version of history.

140
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:37,875
That is the world
that should be.

141
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:42,083
And there!

142
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:48,708
No!

143
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:51,208
No! No! No!

144
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:53,208
You're wrong, Naru!

145
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:55,000
Ao?

146
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:55,791
Hey!

147
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:57,500
Everything's fine now!

148
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:59,166
Truth is on the
side of the Scubs.

149
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,833
You have to get away from there!

150
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,000
Hurry!

151
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:11,375
Truth.

152
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:13,625
Why are you doing this?

153
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:15,833
The world is wrong.

154
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:19,500
Mankind harnesses nuclear
power in the name of progress.

155
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:21,791
The Soviet Union becomes Russia;

156
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:25,250
the US uses its military
might to become a superpower,

157
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:28,416
and Okinawa never declares
independence from Japan.

158
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,000
That is the correct world.

159
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:34,375
It is a world in which
there are no Scub Corals.

160
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:35,833
Nor are there Secrets.

161
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:39,333
As for me, I am
neither of those things.

162
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:43,291
This power that I wield.

163
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:46,083
It is the power of the world as
it was meant to be!

164
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:51,791
Naru!

165
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:55,000
Naru!!

166
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:01,833
Naru.

167
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:04,791
Damn you!

168
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:05,833
Come.

169
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:08,083
Ao Fukai!

170
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:13,208
The Trapar concentration is
rising rapidly.

171
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:14,083
Rajkumar.

172
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:15,875
Take Naru and get out of here.

173
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:17,250
As far as you can go!

174
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:19,166
Is Ao going to be okay?

175
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,125
You said it affects Coral
Carriers.

176
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:23,875
You did it for yourself.

177
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:26,791
If you can't change something,
then you should accept it.

178
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:30,458
Are you going to answer her?

179
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:33,583
You are the all-knowing Mom
Hannah, aren't you?

180
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:46,708
No, don't do this.

181
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:47,208
Liu.

182
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:48,000
Lerato.

183
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:49,000
Do it, Ao!

184
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:50,750
Fire the gun!

185
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:52,458
It's okay.

186
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:54,291
We were prepared for this.

187
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:56,500
We've been waiting.

188
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:57,958
I can't shoot!

189
00:10:58,041 --> 00:11:00,333
If I fire, you'll both be blown
to bits along with him!

190
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:03,166
Truth destroyed the
Poseidon and its crew.

191
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,666
He won't get away with it.

192
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:05,875
And don't forget.

193
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:09,208
He almost killed someone
you care about, too.

194
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:10,291
I know.

195
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:12,333
But I can't sacrifice
you so easily.

196
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:14,541
How can I open
fire on my friends?!

197
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:16,916
You really are a weakling.

198
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:21,125
Liu!

199
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:22,416
Lerato!

200
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:28,791
What's wrong, are you scared?

201
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:31,333
Are you afraid of
learning the truth?

202
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:32,833
You are so pathetic.

203
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:36,416
I can't let someone as weak as
you wield so much power!

204
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:59,333
First I thought the
Secrets were our enemy.

205
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:02,291
But it turns out they weren't.

206
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:04,708
After that, the Scubs
were the bad guys.

207
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:06,166
And now Truth.

208
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,375
He's the evil that
must be fought.

209
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:10,916
Is all of this just me?

210
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,375
Is that what's going on?

211
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:14,708
All this time.

212
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:16,875
Have I just been
looking for an enemy?!

213
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,458
You're not a Secret, and
you're not a Scub, either.

214
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:32,333
So you're not allowed
to exist in this world.

215
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:33,500
Seriously?!

216
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:34,250
Come on.

217
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:36,416
Who made that rule?

218
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,750
I get that you don't
feel like you belong here.

219
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:40,583
But that doesn't
make the world wrong,

220
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:43,458
and it doesn't give you
the right to destroy it!

221
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:46,000
Do you hear me?

222
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:52,958
What does this even change?

223
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:54,166
Nothing.

224
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,916
Nothing!

225
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,250
Like I said before,
you're too weak.

226
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:04,541
I hate repeating myself.

227
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:05,833
You're still--?

228
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:16,125
However it happened,
I learned of the correct world.

229
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:17,708
I can't undo that.

230
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:20,166
I cannot erase the
knowledge from my mind.

231
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:27,583
So that's what he wants.

232
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:29,208
To vanish.

233
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:31,833
Leave the world where
he can't truly exist.

234
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:34,208
The world where
he doesn't belong.

235
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:35,791
The correct world.

236
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:37,875
The one and only truth.

237
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:39,208
What does that even mean?

238
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:40,666
How much are you going

239
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:44,625
to sacrifice on this
impossible quest?!

240
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:49,625
Will you die?

241
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:51,125
Or will it happen again?

242
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:53,875
Will I lose more friends when
history rewrites itself?!

243
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:10,125
What's going on here?

244
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:19,666
Great, Ao!

245
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:20,750
You did it!

246
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:22,500
Did what?

247
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:26,333
You used the Quartz Gun
to take that guy out!

248
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:28,583
That guy?

249
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:29,791
You mean.

250
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:31,291
I got Truth?

251
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:33,333
Truth?

252
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:35,208
What are you talking about?

253
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,583
The Coral Relic IFO
that the Allied Forces

254
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:40,875
had stolen has been
confirmed destroyed.

255
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,666
Remainder gauge
is at twenty-three.

256
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,291
I did it, then.

257
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:48,666
This is a new
version of the world.

258
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:51,791
Because I fired the
gun a second time.

259
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:54,583
It's finally over.

260
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:55,750
We've won.

261
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:58,250
Mankind won't have
to fight anymore, now.

262
00:14:58,333 --> 00:15:00,500
Divided between
Scubs and Secrets.

263
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:02,250
We have word on Naru Arata.

264
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:05,083
Her Nirvash has
been incapacitated.

265
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:11,125
Naru!

266
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:12,208
Is that you?

267
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:14,708
After all this,
that' s what you say?

268
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,000
I'm sorry.

269
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,250
About everything with Truth.

270
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:19,166
Truth?!

271
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:20,708
Is that your new girlfriend?

272
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:21,916
Weird name.

273
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,958
Come on.

274
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:24,833
Go ahead and
finish me off, already.

275
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:26,666
It'll be your final shot, right?

276
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,583
What are you talking about?

277
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:30,500
The Quartz Gun works
by releasing the energy

278
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:32,291
in the Quartz themselves.

279
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:34,375
It'll be used up
before much longer.

280
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:36,583
If you won't.

281
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:48,458
I will.

282
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:50,500
What happened?

283
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:52,041
I shot her.

284
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:55,291
Naru!

285
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,125
Naru!

286
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:10,208
Where's Naru?

287
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:12,666
What have you done
with my daughter?!

288
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,666
She's in the
hospital on this base.

289
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,250
Some military personnel attacked

290
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:19,583
the Generation Bleu headquarters
and stole an IFO prototype.

291
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:21,166
Eco-terrorists
were also involved

292
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,875
in trying to protect the Scubs.

293
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:25,791
Both groups will be
placed under investigation.

294
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:26,500
Why?

295
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:27,750
That's not fair!

296
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:29,708
The US put them up
to it in the first place!

297
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:30,791
And now.

298
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:32,333
The entire world
finally understands

299
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:34,791
that Scub Corals are dangerous.

300
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:36,208
However, we're getting a reading

301
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:39,083
from inside Naru that's
the same as it is for Quartz.

302
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:46,541
Hey, shouldn't you
be back on duty?

303
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:47,250
No, man.

304
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:48,791
I'm still not healed up.

305
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:58,708
When I fired it the first
time, it rewrote history so that

306
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:02,416
the Coral plant in Norway
never existed to begin with,

307
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:06,083
and Team Goldilocks disappeared.

308
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:09,291
The second time I fired it,

309
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:12,833
it made it so that Truth
never existed to begin with.

310
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:14,416
The Allies stole the Canon

311
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:18,958
and tried to fight against the
Secrets alongside Naru's people.

312
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:23,000
That's how things have
been rewritten this time.

313
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:41,583
They'll be reconsidering
the Trapar business now.

314
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:44,000
What will happen to the Quartz?

315
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:47,291
If there are Quartz inside
Naru and people like her, then--

316
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:52,583
What was that?!

317
00:17:57,291 --> 00:17:58,750
Keep an eye on Naru for me!

318
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:00,708
Why, what's happening?

319
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:04,916
Oh, it's nothing.

320
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,166
We won't have to make
someone the enemy anymore!

321
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:12,833
Come on.

322
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:14,250
What's with the long face?

323
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:17,666
The world's the way you
always wanted it, right?

324
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,041
Yeah, I guess.

325
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:21,250
But in the end, Japan
is still just a minor power.

326
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:23,625
Hey, look.

327
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,083
He's sure running fast.

328
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:28,791
I wonder if something's up.

329
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:31,541
The Okinawa Coral plant?

330
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:32,958
Is something happening there?

331
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:35,750
Its Quartz is scheduled
to be removed tomorrow.

332
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:36,458
What's going on?

333
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:37,708
Could it be a Secret?

334
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:40,500
It's him.

335
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:41,416
Yes.

336
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,958
He has come.

337
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,375
Who is this guy?

338
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:53,958
Hey, Soga!

339
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:55,708
No Secrets should be
appearing anymore, right?

340
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:56,916
That's the deal.

341
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,750
But this craft isn't
from any country I know.

342
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:09,458
Sure enough, a Scub Coral.

343
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:12,291
As I thought, they're here, too.

344
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:41,541
Ao!

345
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:42,458
What happened out there?

346
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:43,333
Are you okay?

347
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:45,041
We should head out, too, Chief.

348
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,625
It's Eureka!

349
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:50,708
This is her?

350
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:54,000
He's here.

351
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:56,458
The remainder gauge
is at forty-eight.

352
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:58,541
The Quartz went
and did it again.

353
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:03,250
Damn it!

354
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:04,833
At close range like this.

355
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:12,750
A man.

356
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:13,875
Who is that?

357
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:23,083
Whoa, what?!

358
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:23,875
No way.

359
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:25,250
How's he know about that?

360
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:28,750
Did you tamper
with the Nirvash Neo?

361
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:31,833
What have you done
with the real pilot?

362
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:34,041
Well?!

363
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:36,958
This Nirvash Neo was originally
piloted by a woman named Eureka.

364
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:39,125
Those eyes!

365
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:41,125
Who are you?

366
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:42,916
Ao! Do you copy me?

367
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,541
Eureka has appeared
onboard the Triton.

368
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:46,583
My mom?!

369
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:50,208
I see.

370
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:51,000
So you're.

371
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,208
Roger that.

372
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:52,875
I'll work something
out here and be right--

373
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:55,250
It's time to go, Ao.

374
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:56,500
I have to see Eureka.

375
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:58,625
I want you to take me to her.

376
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:08,083
You disappeared from Okinawa,
along with the giant Quartz.

377
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,500
And you've just been
wandering randomly

378
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:11,208
through time ever since then.

379
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:13,333
Isn't that right?

380
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:16,333
I can't seem to remain in the
same time or place for long.

381
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,833
It's jumbled.

382
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:21,041
I come back after a few days
and find years have passed.

383
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:22,583
Hey!

384
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:24,541
Wait.

385
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:25,708
I'm sorry.

386
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:28,416
This guy undid the
lock on his own, and I--

387
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,583
Eureka.

388
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:34,500
It's you!

389
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:36,041
Don't!

390
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:36,958
Stay there.

391
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:39,708
You can't touch me, anyway.

392
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,708
Eureka.

393
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:45,791
Did you have no other choice?

394
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:47,458
No, I'm sorry.

395
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:49,208
I'm the one who
should apologize.

396
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:52,916
So, you met Ao.

397
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,083
He's a good boy.

398
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:55,708
Very energetic.

399
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:57,791
And more honest than you!

400
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:00,916
What you've been
looking for is here.

401
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,875
Ao has it.

402
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:06,666
It was the same thing
that summoned you here.

403
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,000
Wait, Mom!

404
00:22:19,958 --> 00:22:23,208
As for you, are you
who I think you are?

405
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:29,625
You can't be.

406
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:31,666
That's right.

407
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,166
My name is Renton Thurston.

408
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:34,958
And I am Eureka's husband.

409
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,583
To be continued.

410
00:24:12,958 --> 00:24:15,708
Next time on Eureka Seven AO.

411
00:24:15,791 --> 00:24:18,625
The blue planet the
parents strive to protect.

412
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:21,291
The blue skies
the child strives to fly.

413
00:24:21,375 --> 00:24:24,625
With eyes wide open,
Ao has chosen his final path.

414
00:24:24,708 --> 00:24:28,416
But what waits for him beyond
the brilliant pillar of light?

415
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:33,583
Eureka Seven AO, Final episode:
"The Door into Summer."

416
00:24:33,666 --> 00:24:36,041
Hear the cry of the
children of the stars.
