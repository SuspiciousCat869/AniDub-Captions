1
00:01:47,791 --> 00:01:49,166
What's happening?

2
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:52,041
Hold on--where is Blanc?

3
00:01:57,958 --> 00:01:58,666
Hey JJ.

4
00:01:58,750 --> 00:01:59,625
That you?

5
00:01:59,708 --> 00:02:00,875
I'm sorry.

6
00:02:00,958 --> 00:02:02,958
The Kyrie and Alleluia
are in no shape to fly.

7
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:04,250
What're those?

8
00:02:06,458 --> 00:02:07,083
Oh.

9
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:08,250
They're prototypes.

10
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:11,458
The Requiem,
the Gloria, and the Credo.

11
00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:12,750
The Credo.

12
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,541
Dad, hey!

13
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:22,291
Hello?!

14
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:23,083
Come on, Dad!

15
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:25,166
Please, answer me!

16
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:28,083
I'm sorry.

17
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:41,791
There're Trapars in there.

18
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:45,583
The result of a fusion blast.

19
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,166
Georg?

20
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,166
No wait, you're the
Secret, aren't you?

21
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,375
What do you mean,
a fusion blast?

22
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:52,958
Christophe Blanc
must have hit Truth

23
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:56,041
with all the Quartz he had left
after the forming of the Gun.

24
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:58,375
Because Truth was also a Secret.

25
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:02,166
And my dad?

26
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,458
Tell me what's happened to him!

27
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:04,750
Quartz are invaders.

28
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:06,666
They do not belong
in this dimension.

29
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,041
In order to destroy them,

30
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:09,958
Secrets annihilate
not just the Quartz,

31
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:12,583
but the very space
around them, as well.

32
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:14,083
I don't believe you!

33
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,708
Remember what they told us?

34
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:20,958
Georg's messed up thanks to
his contact with the Secret!

35
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:21,708
It's his fault.

36
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:22,583
He did this!

37
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:23,625
Hold on, Fleur.

38
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:25,333
Remember what
your dad said, too.

39
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:28,333
That maybe the Secrets
aren't the enemy, after all.

40
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:31,750
We can't be sure now.

41
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:34,208
There's just too
much we don't know.

42
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:47,333
Hurry.

43
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:49,333
We don't know how long
the power will last.

44
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:54,125
Commander, are we not
launching a direct attack?

45
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:56,208
I'm hoping to avoid
the use of brute force.

46
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:57,541
It'll be easier for everyone

47
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:59,291
if they just come out
with their hands up.

48
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:00,708
They profit from our desire

49
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:03,750
to do no more
harm than necessary.

50
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:08,250
We haven't been able to get a
read on Blanc's ID badge yet.

51
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:08,916
I'm sorry.

52
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Give up the search.

53
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,000
He was the president
to the very end.

54
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:14,041
Even if we tried to recover
him, the way things are--

55
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:17,416
The Allied Forces' attack
shouldn't last for much longer.

56
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,708
We know the Quartz Gun
is what they're after.

57
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:21,708
If we surrender it to them--

58
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:23,125
The Quartz Gun is safe.

59
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:25,375
It's still in a secure
location on the deepest level.

60
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:26,416
Is that your plan?

61
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,666
You want us to
just hand it over?

62
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:37,500
There's no need to
discuss this any furthe--

63
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:40,291
We shouldn't do it.

64
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:42,125
I know this might
sound unconvincing,

65
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:45,375
since I did consider joining
the Allied Forces at one point.

66
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:46,583
But Blanc told us something,

67
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:48,083
he said that we
needed to figure out

68
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:49,958
what the right thing to do was.

69
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,625
What else could be
right in this situation

70
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,833
but doing what
we can to survive?

71
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:55,875
I don't know for sure yet
what the right path is,

72
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:58,166
but I don't believe
it's giving in.

73
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,708
If we don't step up
to the plate now,

74
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:02,333
when the threat to our survival
is greatest, when will we?!

75
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:04,208
That sounds like the
logic terrorists use.

76
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:05,541
You're one to talk,

77
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:07,666
blindly following the higher-ups
and erasing Georg!

78
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:08,958
What other choice did I have?

79
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:10,583
I did it to protect everyone!

80
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:13,166
Fighting the Allies has never
been a viable option, Ao.

81
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,083
Don't you see that?

82
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:16,875
Here, look.

83
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:18,500
You know what this is, right?

84
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:20,416
Impossible!

85
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,708
All the main systems were
wiped clean simultaneously!

86
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:25,375
The pilot terminals have sectors
with high security levels.

87
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,708
These were not
affected by the purge.

88
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:29,458
We can make a copy off that.

89
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:32,208
The Triton will be able to fly!

90
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:33,708
Ivica?!

91
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:39,708
If you take the center shaft,

92
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:41,666
you can get to
the deepest level.

93
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:45,583
I'm going.

94
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:47,958
We can't leave the
Quartz Gun behind.

95
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:49,708
Ao.

96
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:54,583
Don't worry. It'll work.

97
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:56,041
Even without Georg,
Nirvash can st--

98
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:58,000
I'm gonna need you
to fire the gun, Ao.

99
00:05:58,083 --> 00:06:00,208
Sorry, but I can't.

100
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:10,583
As soon as Georg is successfully
reinstalled on the Triton, link

101
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:13,541
them up to the electromagnetic
catapult controls.

102
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:16,458
Prepare for launch and
equip IFOs at the same time!

103
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:17,791
Hurry, but don't rush!

104
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:18,916
We're going to
need some volunteers

105
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,541
from among the mechanics.

106
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:22,208
You realize if you
ask for volunteers,

107
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:24,166
you'll wind up taking them all.

108
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:33,708
Hey, Alex, can
you open this gate?

109
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:35,875
Once you get past Gate Twenty,
everything's restricted.

110
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:37,833
I can't open any
of them remotely.

111
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:40,291
You don't mind if I destroy
them, then, do you?

112
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:49,541
How long is it gonna
take them to surrender?

113
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:51,000
Take a look at this.

114
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,041
They're finally giving in?

115
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:00,666
No, it's just the
residential zones

116
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:03,833
and the general population
that have been released so far.

117
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:08,375
This is the part of
the job I really hate.

118
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:11,500
It makes it feel like we're
the bad guys instead of them.

119
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:19,708
Are you going to go back

120
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:21,583
to your pals at
Big Blue World now?

121
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:22,833
They were the ones who sent me

122
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:24,875
to work at Generation
Bleu in the first place.

123
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:26,333
So they could have
someone on the inside

124
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:28,416
controlling what went on here.

125
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,083
Big Blue World is the most
influential PR company

126
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:32,458
in the world, you know.

127
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:34,333
If they say that the Secrets
are evil, that's what

128
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:36,958
the rest of the world is
going to believe, as well.

129
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:38,416
Like they did with Trapars.

130
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,708
Convincing everyone
they were necessary for--

131
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:43,416
Please, Rebecka.

132
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,750
Listen to me.

133
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:46,833
You know perfectly well
the kind of burden I bear.

134
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:48,791
It's not something I can
just walk away from.

135
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:50,791
This is all we need, isn't it?

136
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:53,583
Ao's cell.

137
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:55,875
We're going to use it to
restore the Triton's system

138
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:57,625
and get it up and running again.

139
00:07:57,708 --> 00:07:59,625
How long do you
think it will take you?

140
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:00,791
You're doing it?

141
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:02,250
Chief, are you sure?

142
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:04,875
The children have
chosen the field of battle.

143
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:06,875
I will protect them
as long as I can.

144
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:09,083
Don't you want
to help me do that?

145
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:12,833
Their safety is
our responsibility.

146
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:15,750
Are you saying that you need me?

147
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:26,500
Give me about seven minutes.

148
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:30,208
Nicely done, Chief.

149
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:31,375
What about you?

150
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:34,000
What will the
Gazelle Agency do now?

151
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:35,791
I'm not sure yet.

152
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:38,916
For the moment, I guess
we're on official sloth duty.

153
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:41,750
Any response from
Christophe Blanc?

154
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:43,000
None so far.

155
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:44,375
The evacuation of civilians

156
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:47,125
and what personnel that
surrendered seems complete.

157
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:49,291
There can't have been
many who opted to surrender

158
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:52,541
if they were able to get out
of there in such a short time.

159
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:53,958
Pilots open fire!

160
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,541
Opening fire, sir!

161
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,833
What's our status, Alex?

162
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:16,083
Do we have the Gun in hand yet?

163
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:16,750
Of course not!

164
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:18,250
Are you kidding?

165
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:20,125
We've got to break through
fifteen gates just to get to it!

166
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:22,041
What about the defensive grid?

167
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:23,166
Is it holding?

168
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,708
It's operational,
but it can't keep up

169
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:27,416
with the speed of the
Allied Forces' IFOs.

170
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:34,166
That kind of maneuvering,
and he's not a child.

171
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:37,375
You can't do that sort of thing
unless you can see the Trapars.

172
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:39,125
But how can that be possible?

173
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:41,125
Yes!

174
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:43,541
I can see the Trapar
waves everywhere!

175
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:51,291
The power to the catapult
is becoming unstable.

176
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:53,458
Chief, authorize the launch!
We need to hurry.

177
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:54,458
We won't last.

178
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:56,500
Not yet!
We wait for Ao to return.

179
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:57,791
But, sir--

180
00:09:57,875 --> 00:09:58,875
This is the Nirvash.

181
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:00,791
Please go ahead
and launch the Triton.

182
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:02,458
Why should we do that, Ao?

183
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:04,250
It'll be faster for
the Nirvash to escape

184
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:06,125
from the deepest level
than for the catapult

185
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:08,375
to launch the Triton from there.

186
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:10,750
Please, hurry!

187
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:17,208
Fine. Launch the Triton.

188
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:19,833
Don't push yourself too hard.

189
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:21,666
Launching the Triton.

190
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:24,250
Good luck.

191
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:38,666
We don't have a confirmed
location for the Mark I?

192
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:39,208
No, sir.

193
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:39,958
Not anymore.

194
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:41,166
We lost the signal

195
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,166
from its transmitter
a couple minutes ago.

196
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:46,041
They caught on to us,
then, and removed it.

197
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:47,208
Energy reading detected

198
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:49,333
from beneath Generation
Bleu Headquarters.

199
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:50,916
What is it?

200
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,500
Energy readings increasing and
expanding toward the surface!

201
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:02,875
This is it.

202
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:10,708
Thank you, Mr. Blanc.

203
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:16,333
The gauge for the Third Engine.

204
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:18,583
But why would it be
glowing like that now?

205
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:20,500
What do these indicators mean?

206
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:22,333
What's going on, Nirvash?

207
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:23,791
Are you doing any of this?

208
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:25,000
The Quartz Gun!

209
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,625
They've done it, sir.

210
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:48,708
Headquarters is
self-destructing!

211
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:49,500
Wait, look.

212
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:51,291
What's that at the center?

213
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:53,083
Is that Quartz?!

214
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:10,166
Launching the Triton, now!

215
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:49,541
You are powerful.

216
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:53,875
But no matter how terrible a
thing you areI won't fear you!

217
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:55,291
Not anymore!

218
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:19,416
What was that bright glow?

219
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,000
Could, Could it be--?

220
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:23,875
Have we just seen one of
the powers of the Quartz Gun?

221
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:28,333
What's happening?

222
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:29,333
Hey!

223
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:31,791
Elena do you know
what's going on?

224
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:48,375
Ao, think carefully
before you shoot.

225
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:50,791
What will the world become?

226
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:52,250
What now?

227
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:54,583
What will it take to
rectify their mistake?

228
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:55,750
Ao! Try to remain calm.

229
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:57,500
What do I do?
Which is the right path?!

230
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:05,125
Reinforcements?

231
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:06,125
But who?

232
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:08,166
Everything will
be all right, Ao.

233
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:11,333
That was Mom Hannah!

234
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:43,458
Fortunately, we escaped just

235
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:46,541
before the explosion,
aboard the Great Proteus.

236
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:47,833
But more than two hundred

237
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:50,416
of the crew weren't
able to get away in time.

238
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,875
I'm sorry.

239
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:54,083
The rest of you will come
join up with us, of course.

240
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:55,416
Ivica, we've already discussed

241
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,791
our next move
with Big Blue World.

242
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,750
We won't be fighting
beside Pied Piper.

243
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:02,083
Team Harlequin's
joining the Allies.

244
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:03,625
Are you serious?!

245
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:04,625
What are you saying?

246
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:06,458
Even down here, Harlequin's IFOs

247
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:09,125
are capable of performing
to their full potential!

248
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,333
With you on our side--

249
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:12,916
Blanc is no longer with us.

250
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,500
What can we do with
what we have now?

251
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:19,083
Don't you see, Ivica?

252
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:20,833
I understand.

253
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:23,083
That's what this is about.

254
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:24,208
What does this mean?

255
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:26,291
Team Harlequin is the enemy now?

256
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:27,000
That's it, Ao.

257
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:28,750
We're retreating.

258
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:30,125
I'm sorry, Chief.

259
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:32,291
We're shifting into
ballistic flight immediately.

260
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:34,125
Come back.

261
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:35,916
Roger that.

262
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:44,833
If we're lucky,

263
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:46,541
that will have bought
us a little time at least.

264
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:48,416
Hey, Rajkumar.

265
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,416
Is that signal still
being transmitted?

266
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,791
Yeah.

267
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:53,583
It's still going strong.

268
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:54,625
Honestly.

269
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:57,125
They require so
much looking after.

270
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:05,416
Fleur.

271
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,291
Come on.

272
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:07,666
Something's wrong with Elena.

273
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,583
She won't come out of the Kyrie.

274
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:11,375
I wonder why.

275
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:12,291
Elena!

276
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:14,000
Please just tell
us what's wrong!

277
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:15,041
Opening!

278
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:18,708
Hey, Elena!

279
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:27,125
Where is she?

280
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,333
I believe you are Elena Peoples.

281
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:34,708
Is that correct?

282
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:35,875
Yeah.

283
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:37,125
That was the name
on the ID I picked up

284
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:39,000
when I came to
this world, anyway.

285
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:40,458
I know all about that.

286
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:41,583
It seems you took part

287
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:45,208
in US intelligence
operations, as well.

288
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:46,458
Why're you here?

289
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:47,791
Did they leave you behind?

290
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:51,083
Well, do you want me?

291
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:52,666
I do, indeed.

292
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,791
Then here I am.

293
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,791
Tell me, though.

294
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:00,791
Why bother hiding your face now?

295
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:04,208
Some kind of symbolic expression

296
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:06,583
of her status as
a traitor, I guess?

297
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:07,916
A dramatic gesture.

298
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,708
Think we should get masks
for ourselves then, too?

299
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:12,666
Hold on a second!

300
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:13,916
I'm picking up something, here.

301
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,708
Not the signal we're tracking.

302
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:18,500
What are we detecting?

303
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:19,291
Any ideas?

304
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:20,625
No, I'm not sure.

305
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:22,833
But it's coming from
the ruins of Headquarters.

306
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:24,916
Something's rising
out of the rubble!

307
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:38,708
What the hell?

308
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,250
What in the world is that?!

309
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:41,166
I knew it!

310
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,875
In a place like this,

311
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:45,458
there's always something
in the basement.

312
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,291
Impossible!

313
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:52,333
Is that the IFO Zero?

314
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:54,791
So Blanc was
hiding it, all along.

315
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:55,958
Damn him!

316
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:56,958
Pull back now.

317
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:57,750
All three of you!

318
00:17:57,833 --> 00:17:58,833
What's going on, Mom?

319
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:00,083
What is that thing?

320
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:01,875
Well its code name is Canon.

321
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:03,791
Canon?

322
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,833
It was excavated
following a Scub Burst

323
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:07,333
in the Soviet Union.

324
00:18:07,416 --> 00:18:10,833
As you can see,
it resembles an IFO.

325
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:13,041
But nobody was
able to control it.

326
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:15,541
A great swath of land
from Siberia all the way

327
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:18,916
to northern China was
annihilated in an instant.

328
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,250
I thought that was from
a series of Scub Bursts.

329
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:23,750
No.

330
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:24,791
Luckily, we determined

331
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:26,875
it couldn't function
without Trapars.

332
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:29,958
So Gen. Bleu quietly
took custody of it.

333
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:32,625
But who's controlling it now?

334
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:38,708
My appearance.

335
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:40,291
My awareness.

336
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:42,458
What happened?

337
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:45,375
Where am I?

338
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,250
What are you?

339
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:48,916
Or who?

340
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:52,083
Archetype?

341
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:54,666
But is that your
name or what you are?

342
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:57,250
Oh, well, whatever.

343
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:58,208
Who cares.

344
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:00,083
You and I are one now.

345
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:01,375
Aren't we?!

346
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,500
Faisal Arabia has said

347
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:37,291
they might be interested
in taking us in.

348
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:40,666
Well, good to know we've still
got allies out there, at least.

349
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,666
We all know how they
feel about the US.

350
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,333
They probably
just want a weapon.

351
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:45,500
Beggars can't be choosers.

352
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:46,750
We'll have to find a country

353
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:49,041
to land in eventually
in order to resupply.

354
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:52,500
Too bad we can't just stay
up in the air forever, huh?

355
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:53,625
There's more.

356
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:55,083
China and Australia have issued

357
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:57,833
official statements
denouncing us.

358
00:19:57,916 --> 00:20:02,291
They say they'll open fire if
we violate their airspace, so--

359
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:06,958
We're in outer space and
you've still got cell reception?

360
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:07,458
Yeah.

361
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:08,166
It was easy.

362
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,541
I was able to hook it up

363
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:13,750
to a network using the
Triton's connection, I--Hey.

364
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:15,333
This is--

365
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:20,708
Is there any place
left for us to run to?

366
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:22,500
Where are we going to go now?

367
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:29,875
It's a pleasure
to meet all of you.

368
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:31,208
My name is Yamaoka,

369
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:33,875
and I am with the
Japanese Cabinet Office.

370
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:36,125
We have a standing agreement
with Christophe Blanc.

371
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:37,333
In accordance with which,

372
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:39,708
we will provide your
team necessary supplies,

373
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:41,000
such as food and fuel.

374
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:43,625
And offer you use of
the JAF air bases.

375
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:44,875
The Japan Armed Forces?

376
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:45,958
What are you playing at?

377
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:48,125
You people have
always had it in for us!

378
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:51,041
You don't fully
understand the situation.

379
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:53,833
We were the ones who
negotiated this deal with Blanc.

380
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:54,458
What?

381
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:55,500
The Secrets?!

382
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:56,500
Correct.

383
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:58,125
However, as we
are not accustomed

384
00:20:58,208 --> 00:20:59,375
to the ways of humans,

385
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,166
we had the
Japanese government act

386
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,125
as our brokers
for the agreement.

387
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:05,541
And this agreement,
what does it say?

388
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:07,458
The terms are as follows.

389
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:09,541
The Nirvash and any other IFOs

390
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:11,333
and pilots that remain
will devote themselves

391
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:13,125
to the effort of
eliminating the Quartz

392
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:15,250
that lay inside the Scub Corals.

393
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:17,458
Until such time as that
objective is complete,

394
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:19,625
the Secrets will
refrain from appearing.

395
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:22,541
In other words, you will not
trigger any more Scub Bursts.

396
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:24,291
The mass of Quartz that
has fused together into

397
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:25,833
what you are calling
the Quartz Gun is

398
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:27,916
an incredibly dangerous object.

399
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,166
I am aware of that.

400
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:33,000
However, if you will
not accept these terms,

401
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:36,166
I guarantee you
that we will fire it.

402
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:39,541
Understood.

403
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:43,541
We will discuss all of this
with the Japanese government.

404
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:46,291
If I should die, this agreement
will pass to my daughter.

405
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:47,500
It will remain in effect

406
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:50,208
under the supervision
of Miss Fleur Blanc.

407
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:52,500
Without even telling me.

408
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:55,291
In the end, I've robbed
her of everything

409
00:21:55,375 --> 00:21:59,625
a young girl should have,
a normal life, a loving mother.

410
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:03,125
There's nothing else
that I can leave her.

411
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:06,000
Only the future.

412
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:18,125
So that mankind
is never subjected

413
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:20,375
to the threat of
Scub Bursts again,

414
00:22:20,458 --> 00:22:22,875
we will eradicate all trace
of the Quartz from Earth

415
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:25,833
and enter into a peace
accord with the Secrets.

416
00:22:25,916 --> 00:22:29,708
To that end, we will hereby
sponsor Team Pied Piper.

417
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:37,958
To be continued!

418
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,708
Next time on Eureka Seven AO.

419
00:24:15,791 --> 00:24:16,875
Adhering to the deal made

420
00:24:16,958 --> 00:24:19,416
by Blanc, Team
Pied Piper lands in Japan.

421
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:22,000
Elena has decided to fight
beside the Allied Forces,

422
00:24:22,083 --> 00:24:24,750
in hopes of finding the
world in which she belongs.

423
00:24:24,833 --> 00:24:28,708
What will happen when Ao's
former friend stands in his way?

424
00:24:28,791 --> 00:24:33,916
Eureka Seven AO, Episode 21:
"rising sun."

425
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,958
Hear the cry of the
children of the stars.
