1
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,000
How's the fishing?

2
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:57,625
Good?

3
00:01:58,416 --> 00:01:59,375
Catch anything?

4
00:01:59,458 --> 00:02:00,875
Not yet!

5
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:10,166
A bite!

6
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:12,625
Be careful!

7
00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:14,000
I can handle this.

8
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:16,166
I did grow up on an island.

9
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:27,750
I lost the pole.

10
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:29,750
That was a close one.

11
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:31,291
Are you hurt at all?

12
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:32,958
I'm fine.

13
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:34,166
Oh um...

14
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,750
But what about you?

15
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:38,166
How's your stomach?

16
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,708
Oh, you noticed my little bump?

17
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:44,666
Not so little.

18
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,291
I'm at six months.

19
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,208
It's stable by now.

20
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:13,208
Thank you for the food.

21
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:22,458
Don't you want to give thanks?

22
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:26,791
Thank you for the food.

23
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:27,541
Well done, Ao.

24
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:29,000
You're a good boy.

25
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:30,083
A "good boy"?

26
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:32,541
I'm not a little kid you know.

27
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:33,083
I'm sorry.

28
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:34,833
How old are you?

29
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:36,416
I should be in middle school.

30
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,125
I'm thirteen now.

31
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:41,458
But some things came up
before I could start.

32
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:44,208
Yummy!

33
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:46,083
Yummy! Yummy! Yummy!

34
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:47,291
What is this stuff?

35
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:48,541
It's all so good!

36
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:50,833
Really, it's amazing!

37
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:53,833
It's just an
emergency ration kit.

38
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:55,875
Gen. Bleu does run a
chain of grocery stores,

39
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:57,875
so I guess they know
what they're doing.

40
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:02,875
Maybe, you should ask
them for protection.

41
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:04,625
That name again.

42
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:06,958
You said it before,
but what is it?

43
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:08,416
The name of this country?

44
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,541
Oh, no!

45
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:10,875
No, it's nothing like that!

46
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:12,041
Of course.

47
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:12,833
That's right.

48
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:14,875
Because this is the Earth.

49
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:16,708
Although, it is
completely different

50
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:18,666
than the Earth that I come from.

51
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:23,583
Mothe--!

52
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:24,583
Um!

53
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:26,291
Eureka, will you
describe it to me?

54
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:28,250
The Earth you came from?

55
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,333
Are you familiar
with Scub Coral at all?

56
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:34,083
Yes, very much so.

57
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:34,958
They're here, too.

58
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,250
It's different.

59
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:37,500
We have a lot of them.

60
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:39,166
They're all over the place.

61
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,500
They literally cover
the whole planet.

62
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:44,666
In fact, people used
to live on top of them.

63
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:46,875
That's right.

64
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:50,291
People and Scub Coral,
living together.

65
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,166
If you don't have the authority,

66
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,000
then I'll talk to
someone who does!

67
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:06,750
Put me through to
the Secretary of State!

68
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:08,333
She's reappeared out of nowhere!

69
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:10,583
The same woman
from ten years ago!

70
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:13,000
And she's brought a
new Mark I with her.

71
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:16,333
No, I guess it's a Mark II now.

72
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,416
This time, we need
to make sure to--

73
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:21,000
Yes, sir!

74
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:21,791
Yes!

75
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:22,625
That's true.

76
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:24,291
It is in Japanese water.

77
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:26,833
But we can't just
let Japan have them!

78
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:32,333
I appreciate you
coming all this way.

79
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:33,625
Not at all.

80
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,166
I'm in the reserves.

81
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:38,416
And as such, I'm always prepared
to move to the front lines.

82
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,000
Especially these days.

83
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:41,458
I admire you for that.

84
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:42,458
Tell me.

85
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:44,500
Is what I heard true?

86
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:48,666
Generation Bleu has denied it.

87
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:51,708
But a patrol plane
camera got this.

88
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:58,291
This is unbelievable.

89
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:01,166
I'm sure you can see why
we needed you in particular.

90
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,750
You are the only JAF survivor

91
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:07,250
from the devastating Scub Burst
in Okinawa ten years ago.

92
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,916
We're hoping that you
can negotiate with Eureka.

93
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,166
Seeing a familiar face may
convince her to cooperate.

94
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,916
Good afternoon, Colonel Endo.

95
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,375
It is a real honor to have
you aboard with us, sir.

96
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:20,916
You run a tight ship, Captain.

97
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:23,625
Officer Nakamura.

98
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:26,541
Do you care to explain what
in the world you were thinking?

99
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:28,208
Sir?

100
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:30,916
An unauthorized passenger?

101
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,916
You can't seriously plan
to go on this mission

102
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,666
with your lover in tow.

103
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,875
I'm so scared!

104
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:39,458
You piece of!

105
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:41,416
What the hell are
you doing here, Truth?

106
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,791
I just came to retrieve
what's rightfully mine.

107
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:44,916
I brought Nirvash down.

108
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,125
I want the woman.

109
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:48,166
This is only an
precautionary mission.

110
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,375
The government isn't prepared

111
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:52,416
to get aggressive with
Generation Bleu yet.

112
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,791
Do you understand me?

113
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:56,875
Now isn't the time to
be stirring up trouble.

114
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:57,916
Oh?

115
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,375
But I thought
you had a soft spot

116
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:01,583
for my particular
brand of trouble.

117
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,791
We were too slow!

118
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:29,166
We executed the reentry in
the shortest time possible.

119
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,208
Still!

120
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:31,416
Does it freak anyone else out

121
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,041
that a woman came
out of the Scub Coral?

122
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:36,333
And Ao hasn't made
contact with us, either!

123
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:37,708
Everything will be fine.

124
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,750
Here, have one.

125
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:41,875
What is up with this
Eureka person, anyway?

126
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:43,500
She's got you acting weird.

127
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:44,833
Really weird.

128
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:47,458
You even came down from
the space station, Hannah.

129
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:51,000
I think she's a horrible person.

130
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:53,625
Aren't you being a little
ridiculous about this?

131
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:54,708
I am not!

132
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:57,416
Eureka is Ao's
long-lost mother, Fleur.

133
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,458
Yes, I know that, but still.

134
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:01,541
It's just hard to believe.

135
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:03,000
You knew her, too.

136
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:06,000
She saved your life before
disappearing ten years ago.

137
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:07,250
Didn't she?

138
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:10,625
Things are different now.

139
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:12,708
At the moment she's
just a mysterious being

140
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:14,541
who appeared with a Scub Coral.

141
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:16,916
I understand the situation.

142
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,375
Thank you very much.

143
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:23,166
This is the return.
This is the return.

144
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,875
Eureka.

145
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:29,083
I can't remember the last time
Mom went down to the surface.

146
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:31,541
Who in the world is
this Eureka woman?

147
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:34,291
In the past, when a Scub Coral
appeared, a Secret would come.

148
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:36,375
Then there would
be a Scub Burst.

149
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:38,083
That was just the
way things worked.

150
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:40,666
A fact of life.

151
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:43,583
But that changed.

152
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:49,458
It was ten years ago,
in Okinawa.

153
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:50,708
For the first time in history,

154
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:53,125
mankind succeeded
in fighting off a Secret.

155
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:56,333
We learned that Scub Bursts
could actually be prevented.

156
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:57,791
And the person who taught us...

157
00:08:57,875 --> 00:08:59,541
Was Eureka?

158
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:04,541
And thus Generation
Bleu was born.

159
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:07,916
This isn't good.

160
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,625
The JAF and the Allies based
in Okinawa have mobilized.

161
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:13,791
It's not too late.

162
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:15,833
We can still give Ao the order.

163
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:16,833
He should bring in the person

164
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:19,250
who is ostensibly
Eureka at once.

165
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:20,541
But doing so would mean

166
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:23,166
abandoning the giant ship
that also appeared.

167
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,583
We can't let Japan
or the US have it.

168
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:28,333
We'll never see
such a specimen again.

169
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:31,041
Ao will remain on
guard duty for now.

170
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:33,500
In that case, should we
send Goldilocks for them?

171
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:36,541
Surely they're better suited
for the task than those punks.

172
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:38,750
We need to tread carefully...

173
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:41,500
We lost her once
before, after all.

174
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,291
There's no way of telling
when she might disappear again.

175
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:48,750
I don't want to
frighten her off.

176
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:52,291
The Gekko, huh?

177
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:54,750
Yeah, that's the
name of the ship.

178
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:56,666
I flew in it long ago.

179
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:59,208
With an amazing group of people.

180
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:02,583
We had some
incredible adventures.

181
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:04,041
So was that where?

182
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:06,666
I mean.

183
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:09,916
The baby?

184
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,875
Is that how you met its father?

185
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:15,291
This is so embarrassing!

186
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:17,125
Yes, it is.

187
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:20,166
But you know, it wasn't
like that at first.

188
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,583
I mean he was so immature.

189
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:24,708
A real crybaby.

190
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:28,166
I thought he was hopeless.

191
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,000
So you didn't love him, then?

192
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:32,166
No.

193
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:35,291
Ao, I did love him.

194
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:41,041
Um, would you tell
me more about him?

195
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:47,333
You want to go back.

196
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:51,708
I know that Renton
will do everything

197
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:54,000
he possibly can to find me.

198
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:57,083
Of course, I don't even
really know where I am.

199
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:58,666
That's his name?

200
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,583
We were doing some
research on the phenomenon

201
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:02,583
of the vanishing Scub Coral.

202
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:04,916
He allowed this ship
to be swallowed up.

203
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,166
But something happened
during the process.

204
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,916
And she and I got caught in it.

205
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:15,583
She, who?

206
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:17,000
Do you mean Nirvash?

207
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:20,041
That's right, yours is
Nirvash, too, isn't she?

208
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,416
It's strange.

209
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,375
She looks just like the
one Renton's making now.

210
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:35,125
It's okay.

211
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:37,583
Remember the
communication we received?

212
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:39,791
This is my chief and sub-chief.

213
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:41,375
And this--

214
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:43,916
It's been a long time.

215
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,166
Ivica Tanovi remember?

216
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:52,125
You are Mister Ivica
Tanovi aren't you?

217
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:02,333
That is your name?

218
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:05,208
It is, but I'm afraid
I don't remember who--?

219
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:07,250
Oh, shut up!

220
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:09,958
It may come as a surprise,
but I have met you before.

221
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:11,416
Sorry, I don't think so.

222
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,208
I have certainly heard of you.

223
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:16,000
They say you fell out
of the sky two years ago.

224
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:18,333
Yes, that much is true.

225
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:21,541
But I had been here
once before, long ago.

226
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:27,291
And you, you're Endo.

227
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:29,125
Isn't that correct?

228
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,041
G-Monster sighted!

229
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:48,791
There's no way!

230
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:50,333
Let's leave the
rest to the air force!

231
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:51,166
No!

232
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,458
If a Scub Burst occurs here,

233
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:55,000
the main island of
Okinawa will be obliterated!

234
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:56,083
Hold your ground!

235
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:58,791
You're saying we
should trust that woman?

236
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:02,125
Trust her with that Quartz
stuff she was talking about?

237
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:28,000
It's no use.

238
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:29,708
I have to take it away.

239
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:30,875
Now!

240
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,166
Nirvash!

241
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,916
Hold him off!

242
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:44,500
I'm sorry!

243
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:46,250
I'm sorry, Ao!

244
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,916
Come with me.

245
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,666
That voice!

246
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:27,583
The Sea Colossus!

247
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:48,333
So, our blue-haired
friend has gone?

248
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:50,666
I hear that she
has a young child.

249
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,083
Thanks to us,

250
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:53,875
that poor kid is going to
grow up without a mother.

251
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:55,333
But thanks to her, we know how

252
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:59,125
to prevent these invaders
from destroying our planet.

253
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:00,291
Yes.

254
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:02,708
We may not be able
to defeat the Secrets.

255
00:15:02,791 --> 00:15:05,750
But if we can extract the
things she called Quartz,

256
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:08,625
we can at least
avoid Scub Bursts.

257
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:13,625
I'm Christophe Blanc.

258
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:15,583
If you're interested,
I'm forming an organization--

259
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:16,833
Thanks for the offer,

260
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,833
but I need to get
back to my country.

261
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:20,083
There are many children there

262
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:22,541
who are losing
their mothers as well.

263
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:26,750
Well, after that, then.

264
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:32,750
I'm sorry but, sir.

265
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:35,583
I really think this is
the first time we've met.

266
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:36,375
What?

267
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:37,791
I don't understand, Chief.

268
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:40,000
I thought you said you knew her.

269
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:43,708
An Eureka from the past?

270
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:46,250
She's from a time
before she had you.

271
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:47,916
Who knows when?

272
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,166
Some time before her appearance

273
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,416
on Iwato Island
thirteen years ago.

274
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,375
Wait let me get this straight.

275
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:56,375
Okay, so, this Eureka's
from before I existed.

276
00:15:56,458 --> 00:16:00,250
Does that mean the
baby she's carrying is me?

277
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:11,541
I have managed to establish
a partial link with the ship.

278
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:13,375
I could only analyze
some of the numbers,

279
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:14,833
but they gave me a date.

280
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:17,708
The data was recorded in the
year twelve thousand five.

281
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:21,333
So, are you saying that the ship
came from the distant future?

282
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:24,500
Eureka's not an alien,
but a time-traveler?

283
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,375
Is that it?

284
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:31,625
For ten thousand years
and two thousand more.

285
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:34,583
This is no time for
that kind of sentiment.

286
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:36,875
Not at all.

287
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:41,541
I can see why you're worried.

288
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:45,458
Yes, and it's not just the
birth I'm concerned about.

289
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:47,875
I'm afraid the child
might grow to resent me.

290
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:50,583
It's a little late
for that, isn't it?

291
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:53,458
Think about it: you fell
in love with somebody.

292
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:55,791
And you decided to
have a child with him.

293
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:59,625
Because it's what you wanted.

294
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:00,958
So why start worrying about

295
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:04,083
how your child's going
to feel at this point?

296
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:05,583
You did it for yourself.

297
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:08,041
If you can't change something,
then you should accept it.

298
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:09,666
Shouldn't you?

299
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,375
The doctors are concerned, too.

300
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:13,333
The child of a
Coralian and a human,

301
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:15,041
born into an
environment where the air

302
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:17,375
has a high trapar concentration.

303
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:19,625
What the hell are
you idiots doing here?

304
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:21,541
Blanc sent you?

305
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:23,583
The Gazelle Agency
is an independent team,

306
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:25,833
but we are funded by
the company president.

307
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:29,125
And, um, she tagged
along without us realizing.

308
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:30,583
Noa!

309
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:32,583
How did you find us, anyway?

310
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:34,375
Your mom around here somewhere?

311
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:35,666
Answer the question, damn it!

312
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,416
No need to get worked up.

313
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,916
See, the JAF and
the Allied Forces

314
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,625
started surrounding this area.

315
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:43,458
So we let the Triton
play decoy for us

316
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:45,625
while we took a
Generation Bleu sky truck

317
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:48,791
that was on standby
somewhere else.

318
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,250
Too bad, Eureka says she
doesn't want to leave here!

319
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:56,125
We will return her
to her own world.

320
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:57,250
Return her?

321
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:58,666
But her presence
here has the potential

322
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,416
to significantly
advance our research

323
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,083
on Secrets and Scub Coral.

324
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:05,166
She is destined to
come back here again.

325
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:08,375
About thirteen years ago.

326
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:10,583
Uh, that doesn't make sense.

327
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:12,875
Do you even know
how to send her back?

328
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,916
No, I don't think so.

329
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,500
I think you just want

330
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:20,125
to keep her well away
from Generation Bleu.

331
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:21,791
You in love with her?

332
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:24,000
She did save your life.

333
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:25,625
Well, are you?

334
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:28,500
You're full of crap,
you bastard!

335
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:29,000
Hey!

336
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:29,875
Get off!

337
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:31,666
Why are you always like this?

338
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:34,291
You think you're the only
one who knows anything.

339
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:36,708
You screw things up
for everyone else!

340
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:39,166
What the hell gives
you the right, huh?

341
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:42,041
Oh, man!

342
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:43,583
I smell gunpowder.

343
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:45,583
We're breached!

344
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,250
It really is you, isn't it?

345
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:49,708
Eureka?

346
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:53,333
No mistaking it.

347
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:54,750
What do you want with me?

348
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:56,041
And where's Hannah?

349
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:56,791
Don't worry.

350
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:58,333
She's unharmed.

351
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:00,458
Hannah!

352
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:01,875
Why are you doing this?

353
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:03,083
In here!

354
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:04,916
What's going on?

355
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,166
Endo!

356
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,791
Of the GSDF!

357
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:09,041
Endo?

358
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:11,916
Give us some cover fire!

359
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,250
Come, this way!

360
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:15,458
Wait hold on!

361
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:16,333
Return fire?

362
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:18,416
Not with Hannah still inside.

363
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:21,333
I don't know everything, okay?

364
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:22,375
But so what?

365
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:24,208
I do know this
world is screwed up!

366
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:25,875
Mama is staying with me!

367
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:28,000
I won't let you take her away!

368
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:34,958
That's her?

369
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,750
Mama! Mama!

370
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:37,416
No way.

371
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,791
That chick's Eureka?

372
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:39,666
Come on!

373
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:40,875
Run away with me!

374
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:41,500
Let's go.

375
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:43,000
Where to?

376
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:45,500
Chief said he's going
to send you back.

377
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:48,333
Mama, I don't
want to say goodbye.

378
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:51,500
Only, what will
happen if you stay here?

379
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:54,125
If the child you're
carrying is me, then.

380
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:58,041
You're not so bright.

381
00:19:58,125 --> 00:20:00,333
Are you, child of Eureka?

382
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:01,708
Truth?

383
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:06,083
Who are you?

384
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:08,041
I'm sorry for our rough
handling of the situation,

385
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:10,250
but unfortunately
neither the Allied Forces

386
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:12,625
nor Generation Bleu
can be trusted.

387
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:14,708
They're looking out for
themselves and nobody else.

388
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:16,791
Only Japan desires peace.

389
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:18,250
Please.

390
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:34,541
No. It was Truth.

391
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:38,083
Naru?

392
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:41,958
Ao, my little boy.

393
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:43,083
Mama!

394
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,083
Mama!

395
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:49,958
Ao.

396
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:51,791
You need to send me back.

397
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,750
Back to Renton.

398
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:55,583
You're the only one who can.

399
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:56,791
Please send me back.

400
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:57,875
No I can't!

401
00:20:57,958 --> 00:20:59,291
I finally found you!

402
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:00,791
I've been looking for so long!

403
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:01,916
You must!

404
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,291
Something terrible
will happen soon.

405
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:06,208
What are you talking about?

406
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:07,666
And one more thing.

407
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,875
The Secrets are not your enemy.

408
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:12,083
What was that?

409
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:16,041
What did she just say?

410
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:18,333
What do you mean the
Secrets aren't our enemy?

411
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:20,208
Of course they are!

412
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:29,625
Oh-ho.

413
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:31,333
So, you're having a baby?

414
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:32,291
Who're you?

415
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:33,333
Tell me!

416
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:34,916
That's a hell of a greeting.

417
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,750
Very cold.

418
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:37,833
No matter.

419
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:39,500
You're mine now.

420
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:40,625
Get away from her!

421
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:42,250
Do you hear me, Truth?

422
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:49,041
Stay out of it!

423
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:50,541
Now, then.

424
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:53,083
Stop, Truth!

425
00:21:58,833 --> 00:22:00,083
Who's that?

426
00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:01,208
Ao?

427
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:03,250
Ao Fukai.

428
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:05,000
You cannot change this world.

429
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:07,333
You don't have the power!

430
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:17,833
Ao!

431
00:22:20,083 --> 00:22:21,166
What!

432
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:22,500
Ao?

433
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:26,000
That's a great shot.

434
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:26,791
Thank you.

435
00:22:26,875 --> 00:22:28,333
I have a child, you know.

436
00:22:28,416 --> 00:22:29,708
He's two.

437
00:22:29,791 --> 00:22:31,250
A real handful.

438
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:33,291
Oh, really?

439
00:22:33,375 --> 00:22:36,458
Um, if anything
should happen to me.

440
00:22:36,541 --> 00:22:38,750
Please look after Ao.

441
00:22:38,833 --> 00:22:41,041
Will you do that?

442
00:22:41,125 --> 00:22:42,416
Okay.

443
00:22:46,083 --> 00:22:47,041
Bastard!

444
00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:49,083
Leave him alone!

445
00:22:49,833 --> 00:22:53,416
She asked me to
look after her child!

446
00:23:13,208 --> 00:23:14,333
Get back here!

447
00:23:17,166 --> 00:23:18,750
Over here!

448
00:23:25,958 --> 00:23:27,500
Damn you, Nirvash!

449
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:30,000
Can you fly it?

450
00:23:30,083 --> 00:23:32,375
I don't know where this place
is or who these people are.

451
00:23:32,458 --> 00:23:35,291
But I do know one thing.

452
00:23:35,375 --> 00:23:36,166
I will...

453
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:38,333
I will protect....

454
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:40,250
...this planet!

455
00:23:41,208 --> 00:23:42,625
Nirvash!

456
00:23:50,416 --> 00:23:51,250
Is that?

457
00:23:51,333 --> 00:23:53,041
That was the Nirvash!

458
00:23:53,125 --> 00:23:54,500
There are two!

459
00:23:55,791 --> 00:23:57,166
Ao!

460
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:59,458
Eureka!

461
00:24:01,833 --> 00:24:03,125
Let's go!

462
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:05,458
Nirvash!

463
00:24:06,458 --> 00:24:07,583
To be continued!

464
00:24:12,875 --> 00:24:15,750
Next time, on Eureka Seven: AO.

465
00:24:15,833 --> 00:24:20,000
The two Nirvash battle Truth,
and an unexpected door opens.

466
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:23,125
A Secret appears, shattering
certain preconceptions.

467
00:24:23,208 --> 00:24:25,291
A dream reveals startling facts,

468
00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:28,500
forcing Ao to question the
very nature of his existence.

469
00:24:28,583 --> 00:24:33,750
Eureka Seven AO, Episode 14.
"another truth."

470
00:24:33,833 --> 00:24:36,125
Hear the cry of the
children of the stars.
