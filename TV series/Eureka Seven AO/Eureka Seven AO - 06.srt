1
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,750
This is some fine
stuff you're smoking.

2
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:11,416
It's good to be president.

3
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:13,958
Look there.

4
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:16,291
A beautiful view, isn't it?

5
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:19,833
You should take a moment to
drink in the incredible scenery.

6
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:23,208
It will be the last
thing you ever see.

7
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,791
You've made quite a
feast of our need...

8
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:34,625
So, how did our
humble country taste?

9
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:39,833
What the hell boy?

10
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:41,166
Why'd you--?

11
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:47,500
Is that what I think it is?

12
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:49,166
A transmitter.

13
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:52,375
A government dog
pretending to be a customer.

14
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:53,833
You Bastard!

15
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:55,583
There's a police raid coming!

16
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:57,500
Hide now! Move it!

17
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:21,208
This is the narcotics unit
of the Myanmar Police Force!

18
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:23,208
Throw down your
weapons and surrender!

19
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:24,250
I repeat!

20
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:26,583
Throw down your
weapons, right now!

21
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:28,916
Shoot them!

22
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:31,375
No chance in hell we're going

23
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:34,208
to let you government weasels
take what belongs to us!

24
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:35,541
Do you hear me, boys?

25
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:36,833
Fight them!

26
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:38,750
What are you waiting for?

27
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:40,208
Take them out!

28
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:42,208
Shoot them, now!

29
00:03:57,875 --> 00:04:01,875
"Financial products
consulting," was that it?

30
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:04,291
Thanks to you,
my country's economy.

31
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:07,083
Is on the verge
of total collapse.

32
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:08,291
And that's my fault?

33
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:10,250
Really?

34
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,083
Respectfully,
I'll have to disagree.

35
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:13,625
You were the one,

36
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:16,833
who ignored the risks to make
a quick profit, weren't you?

37
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:19,083
At least tell me,

38
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:21,625
are you some spook
from another country?

39
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:23,291
Some kind of con artist?

40
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:24,875
Who are you?

41
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:26,333
Good question.

42
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:27,666
Who am I you ask?

43
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:31,916
That's what I'm trying
to find out, as well.

44
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,666
There's not much time
left for soul searching.

45
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:54,125
Tango-Two-Zero, over.

46
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:56,750
I was told that the
target was an Asian male.

47
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:59,000
Has there been some
kind of mistake or...?

48
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:14,000
Boss.

49
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:15,875
Please, Boss why did we fight?

50
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:16,625
Huh?

51
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:19,416
But I told you to hide!

52
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:31,708
No matter how
much blood I make fall.

53
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,625
No matter how much wealth
I am able to destroy.

54
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:46,375
I cannot find the means to
right the wrong in this world.

55
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:47,541
No matter how hard I look,

56
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:49,916
I cannot seem to
find the answer.

57
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:12,750
Well hello...

58
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:15,291
You've made it to
this wrong world.

59
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:19,375
Our flight has leveled off.

60
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:21,958
IFO launch space secure.

61
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:23,208
Launch IFOs.

62
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:24,041
Roger.

63
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:25,333
Launching IFOs.

64
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:26,666
Extend catapult.

65
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:27,625
You copy?

66
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:28,791
Yes!

67
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:31,000
If you have any
questions, just ask Georg.

68
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:32,375
What's Georg?

69
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:33,583
Hello there!

70
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:35,916
It's nice to formally
meet you, Ao Fukai.

71
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,916
I see.

72
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,750
So, you're Georg?

73
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,083
Yes.

74
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:43,750
Now, here is the information
for your deployment.

75
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:45,208
The destination is one hundred

76
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:46,833
and twenty
kilometers off the coast

77
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:49,791
of Point Gallinas, Columbia.

78
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:51,041
The Secret is now advancing

79
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:53,500
at a rate of twenty-two
kilometers per hour...

80
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:57,666
We have lost contact with
Team Goldilocks' IFOs.

81
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:02,000
No way.

82
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:03,791
I just met those three.

83
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:05,583
Our mission is to
destroy the Secret

84
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:09,375
and rescue the members
of Team Goldilocks.

85
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:12,708
Can you do this?

86
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:15,958
I can!

87
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:17,375
I'll do it.

88
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:20,375
That's why Nirvash and
I joined Generation Bleu.

89
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:24,208
Course is all clear.

90
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:26,375
Nirvash, you're set for launch.

91
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:27,916
Understood Triton.

92
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,041
We are ready.

93
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:31,750
Launching now!

94
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:40,791
Team Pied Piper, come in!

95
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:43,250
We need you to
speed up your IFO launch.

96
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:45,541
That's impossible we're
already rushing it!

97
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:47,666
The situation's changed.

98
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,708
The Medon's ignoring
communication from HQ.

99
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:53,458
They've commenced an
assault on the Secret.

100
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:54,791
Damn! Bruno!

101
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:56,250
What are you thinking?!

102
00:07:57,916 --> 00:07:58,875
Everyone copy?

103
00:07:58,958 --> 00:07:59,916
Copy.

104
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,125
Copy.

105
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:02,291
Copy.

106
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:04,583
We'll enter the
combat zone shortly.

107
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:07,625
Assist the Medon, and
stay mindful of the ZOA.

108
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:11,375
If you run into danger,
leave the airspace immediately.

109
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:14,208
And leave Team Goldilocks
out here alone?

110
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:17,375
We still haven't identified
the Secret's main body.

111
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:18,541
Main body?

112
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:20,166
Also, it would appear
that their Chief,

113
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,833
Bruno, intends to halt
the Secret's progress.

114
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:23,875
By himself?

115
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:24,708
Oh, man.

116
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:25,791
Wait a minute!

117
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:28,541
He's come into
contact with the Secret!

118
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:30,416
I have a Thermal reading.

119
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,041
The Medon's exploding!

120
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:46,291
Impossible.

121
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:48,250
This can't be happening.

122
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:49,666
We didn't make it?

123
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,541
I can confirm that is
the Secret's main body.

124
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:55,333
Georg.

125
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:56,375
Status check.

126
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:58,708
Not much has
changed since earlier,

127
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:01,875
but the trapar concentration
is dropping rapidly.

128
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,041
I do not know the cause,

129
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,500
but it is getting thin
enough to make it

130
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:07,208
a bit worrisome for IFO flight.

131
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:09,083
All IFOs, pull back!

132
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:09,875
Roger.

133
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:11,333
Turbulence is getting bad.

134
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:13,250
Hurry!

135
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:14,791
Hold on a second!

136
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:20,791
That was!

137
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:23,166
An Eisenhower?

138
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:33,541
The Secret's begun moving.

139
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:34,625
That Eisenhower.

140
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,416
Was it on our side?

141
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:40,541
Secret now on a
northeasterly course.

142
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:42,041
Speed unchanged.

143
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:44,625
Trapar concentration is up.

144
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:46,208
Full speed ahead!

145
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:49,041
Team Pied Piper will resume its
search for Goldilocks at once!

146
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:50,375
Roger!

147
00:09:56,541 --> 00:10:00,166
That wreckage...

148
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,916
The Medon!

149
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:07,041
Turn around and go back
home as soon as you can.

150
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:09,458
If you stay here, you're
sure to bring sorrow

151
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:11,458
to the people you
care most about.

152
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:12,583
Credo sighted.

153
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:15,625
Both Requiem and Gloria sighted.

154
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:16,500
Good job.

155
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:18,083
Recover all three IFOs quickly,

156
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:20,083
and don't leave
any parts behind.

157
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:21,666
Roger.

158
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,250
Shouldn't our top priority be
to get the pilots to a hospital?

159
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,708
Yes, and the longer
it takes to recover them

160
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:28,666
the longer the delay will be.

161
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,208
But?

162
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:07,750
No.

163
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:12,750
We're getting the
pilots medical attention.

164
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:14,666
Since there's nothing
we can do at this point,

165
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,625
we should have them withdraw.

166
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:19,875
To minimize our
financial losses.

167
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:22,416
If we were to lose the Triton
in addition to the Medon--.

168
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,833
And what if it comes out that
we caused a fusion explosion?

169
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:27,583
What?

170
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:29,375
Now that would do real damage

171
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:31,208
to our corporate image, Stanley.

172
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:34,166
Wouldn't it?

173
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,666
Well then?

174
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,416
We call the shots!

175
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,500
And do what we can.

176
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:00,708
Excuse me!

177
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:01,833
Where are the others?

178
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:07,416
Oh, the older sister
is in the ICU.

179
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,791
You can see the
younger one, though.

180
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:21,250
Oh, no!

181
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:23,083
You're awake.

182
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:24,833
It's you, rookie.

183
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:26,916
Where's everyone?

184
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,875
Are you okay?

185
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:29,958
They're all right...

186
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:35,000
Both Maggie and
your big sister I mean.

187
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:36,875
And, uh...
that teddy bear...

188
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:38,166
Bruno, too.

189
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,750
Are they really?

190
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:44,875
You should get some more rest.

191
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:46,708
I'll keep you company.

192
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:03,291
It's about time!

193
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:05,000
Ao, where are you?

194
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:07,875
This is Goldilocks,
Chloe speaking.

195
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:08,708
Chloe?

196
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:09,791
You're all right?

197
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:11,791
Yeah, I'm okay.

198
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:12,791
What about Ao?

199
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,541
Is he there with you?

200
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:20,833
Tell me.

201
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:23,708
Is the Medon?

202
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:24,875
I'm sorry.

203
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:28,458
I don't know what to say.

204
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,625
Chloe's fine, she's a big girl.

205
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:32,541
He's here.

206
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:34,125
I'll wake him up for you.

207
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:34,833
You mean Ao?

208
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:35,875
He's asleep?

209
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:37,375
Yes.

210
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:39,958
He came straight from Okinawa
and mobilized right away.

211
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:42,166
How long has he
gone without sleep?

212
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,541
Can you blame the kid?

213
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:45,750
But there isn't much time
'til the mission starts.

214
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:47,166
That's okay.

215
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:48,375
It's not like he going to help

216
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:50,583
that much on this
one anyway is he?

217
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:52,541
Why not just let the kid sleep?

218
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:54,708
Alleluia and Kyrie have this.

219
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:56,125
Totally!

220
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,750
What the heck did
you do that for?

221
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:17,291
Because you snore.

222
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:18,041
No I don't!

223
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:19,041
Take that back!

224
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:19,875
I am not a snorer!

225
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:21,583
Alleluia is in position.

226
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:23,000
Commencing scan.

227
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:23,750
Kyrie here.

228
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:24,583
All guns ready.

229
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:25,625
Wait a sec!

230
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:27,291
That sounds like a mission!

231
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:29,833
They said you can
sit this one out.

232
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:32,333
You needed the
sleep, didn't you?

233
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,250
Just great.

234
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:41,000
They don't need me at all, huh?

235
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:43,833
I mean, I'm basically clueless.

236
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,583
What happened out
there with Bruno?

237
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:47,250
I heard.

238
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:53,208
Sorry.

239
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:55,666
Don't apologize!

240
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:03,083
And stop pouting, rookie!

241
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:07,208
Bruno did everything he could
to protect the three of us!.

242
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:09,541
Just like the others
are doing for you!

243
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:11,375
You're sleep deprived
and brand new.

244
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:13,125
They'd be sending
you out to die.

245
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:15,583
They just want to keep you
from getting yourself killed.

246
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:18,708
You see? Would they do that
if they didn't need you?

247
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:23,166
And anyway, your
method would never work

248
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,375
against this particular Secret.

249
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:28,125
The only way to attack
it inside the hurricane

250
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:31,583
is to enter the ZOA and latch
on to the Secret's main body.

251
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:33,375
That's the only choice.

252
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:35,166
You latch on and
destroy the options

253
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:38,791
as they come at you,
one by one.

254
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,750
Oh no, Sis!

255
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:00,666
Chloe came up with that tactic.

256
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:01,791
Chloe didn't want the others

257
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:04,500
to think only you
could enter the ZOA.

258
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:08,250
And now, because of
that, the Medon is--

259
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:12,291
That's it!

260
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:13,708
I'm going, too!

261
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:15,208
Were you listening?

262
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:16,083
Even if you go--!

263
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:18,125
I have to.

264
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:21,125
I thought that, my
Gramps was the only one.

265
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:23,375
The only adult who cared.

266
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:24,958
But I was wrong.

267
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:27,708
So I'm going to go out
there and do what I can.

268
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:30,166
What in the world do
you think you can do?

269
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:33,375
It's not fully formed yet,
but I've got an idea.

270
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:35,583
It's based on the
tactic you guys used.

271
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:38,833
You see, I think you were
actually on the right track.

272
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:41,625
And I'm going to prove it.

273
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:44,541
I have to.

274
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:48,333
Otherwise I will bring
sorrow to the people I love.

275
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:49,833
Just like Bruno said.

276
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:59,083
We're set to go.

277
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:00,666
Fire main guns.

278
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:04,416
Mark!

279
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,666
Set!

280
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,458
Fire!

281
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:11,083
Aw mam!

282
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:13,208
Long-range guns are a no-go.

283
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:14,291
It looks like we'll have to

284
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:15,833
latch onto the
main body, after all.

285
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:16,958
No!

286
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:19,166
Goldilocks already tried that.

287
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,708
Then what do you want us to do?

288
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:24,500
The Secret's already ten
kilometers from the Scub!

289
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:27,833
Please fire the guns again!

290
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:29,916
That's Ao!

291
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,375
What's he doing?

292
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:32,708
Pull back!

293
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:35,375
The options regenerate
if destroyed, right?

294
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:37,541
But that process will
take a little while.

295
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:39,500
Wait, are you suggesting?

296
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,541
I have analyzed the tactic.

297
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:44,291
I believe it is worth a try.

298
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:49,125
Prepare to fire
the primary guns!

299
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:51,833
Have Georg calculate
the best timing.

300
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:52,666
Well Georg?

301
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:53,625
Got that?

302
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:55,375
The timing will be perfect.

303
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:56,666
Fleur, Elena!

304
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:57,916
Back up the Nirvash!

305
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,750
Roger!

306
00:17:58,833 --> 00:17:59,916
I'm synched!

307
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,458
Do you copy, Georg?

308
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:03,166
Understood, Ao Fukai.

309
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,458
We are all counting on you now.

310
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:13,875
Nirvash has crossed
the storm zone.

311
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:15,875
He's entered the
Secret's domain.

312
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:18,000
Prepare for incoming option.

313
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:33,750
Nirvash!

314
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:35,166
Jump now!

315
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,375
Ao.

316
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,041
That was well done.

317
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:42,375
Finally!

318
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:44,041
I understand now!

319
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:47,291
All this time, it's you
I've been waiting for!

320
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:50,833
If you are truly a being
who can defeat Secrets.

321
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:52,583
Then I am--?

322
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,625
I'm so glad to hear that
the surgery went well.

323
00:19:58,708 --> 00:19:59,875
Yes.

324
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:02,541
Sis and Maggie have also
been steadily improving.

325
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:04,000
I sent you a get-well present,

326
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:05,958
but don't show it to
any of those nurses.

327
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:07,958
Got it!

328
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:09,500
Well, I'll let you rest.

329
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:13,916
We're looking forward to having
all three of you back again.

330
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:27,000
That's all you're
buying for the move?

331
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:28,625
Yeah, why?

332
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:29,916
It's enough for now.

333
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Don't you think
it would be easier

334
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:33,166
to get all your
shopping done in one go?

335
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:34,500
Maybe.

336
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:38,250
What's that?

337
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:40,916
Someone besides me is moving?

338
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,041
No that was Bruno's place.

339
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:09,166
Never let children die.

340
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:14,541
You were right, Bruno!

341
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:17,166
You brought sorrow to the
people you cared about.

342
00:23:23,125 --> 00:23:24,375
Hey! Look!

343
00:23:24,458 --> 00:23:25,250
There!

344
00:23:25,333 --> 00:23:27,083
It's a little kid.

345
00:23:27,166 --> 00:23:28,791
Right in the middle of the road.

346
00:23:30,833 --> 00:23:32,708
Bang!

347
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
What the hell?

348
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:42,500
Who are you?

349
00:23:42,583 --> 00:23:43,791
Who is that?

350
00:23:43,875 --> 00:23:44,583
A terrorist?

351
00:23:44,666 --> 00:23:45,666
Contact HQ!

352
00:23:49,416 --> 00:23:51,791
Who am I, you ask?

353
00:23:52,291 --> 00:23:54,333
A very good question.

354
00:23:54,416 --> 00:23:56,541
Let me see.

355
00:24:01,583 --> 00:24:05,250
From this moment on,
my name is Truth.

356
00:24:06,291 --> 00:24:07,250
To be continued!

357
00:24:12,875 --> 00:24:15,375
Next time on Eureka Seven AO.

358
00:24:15,458 --> 00:24:17,500
Generation Bleu finds
itself at the mercy

359
00:24:17,583 --> 00:24:19,750
of an assailant with
an unknown agenda.

360
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:23,250
In the face of reality, people
must turn to self-reflection.

361
00:24:23,333 --> 00:24:24,625
As the destruction ends,

362
00:24:24,708 --> 00:24:27,666
Ao comes face-to-face
with an inescapable truth.

363
00:24:28,833 --> 00:24:33,958
Eureka Seven AO, Episode 7:
"bye bye angel."

364
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:36,458
Hear the cry of the
children of the stars.
