1
00:02:00,291 --> 00:02:01,500
What are you talking about, man?

2
00:02:01,583 --> 00:02:03,750
She's totally into you!

3
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:07,208
I don't know if your tenacity
is a credit to you, Nakamura.

4
00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:10,333
Your bid to get us the
Mark I four months ago

5
00:02:10,416 --> 00:02:12,333
ended in abject failure.

6
00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:15,791
The entire IFO Defense Project
is set to be scrapped.

7
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:18,750
We've been marginalized on the
world stage for long enough.

8
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:20,500
And our dealings
with the Allied Nations

9
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:22,333
could go sour at any time.

10
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:25,083
If we can get our hands
on something this powerful.

11
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:28,458
Japan could emerge from the
doldrums as a modern juggernaut!

12
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:33,125
Maybe so but on the other hand.

13
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:34,583
Japan has only made it this far

14
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:37,875
because we've avoided your
brand of military posturing.

15
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,833
Stirring things up like that
just makes the people nervous.

16
00:02:42,916 --> 00:02:45,375
Not to mention that
it's a PR nightmare.

17
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:47,916
You need to keep in mind that
anything Scub-related is going

18
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,958
to be an extremely hard sell
to your fellow Japanese.

19
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:52,416
I'm trying to fix our nation,

20
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,250
and the Ministry of Finance
can't be bothered to help?

21
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:57,666
Sir, it will work.

22
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,375
Please, get out of the car.

23
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:10,666
So they didn't go for it.

24
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:11,791
If they have their way,

25
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:14,000
nothing around here
will ever change.

26
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:15,208
I'm thinking of our future.

27
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:17,375
Why the hell can't
they see that?

28
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:18,458
So be it!

29
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:19,500
The cowards can rubber-stamp it

30
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:22,208
after we've succeeded
in our goal.

31
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:23,375
I'm forwarding you the data

32
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:25,333
that the Firecracker
people sent me.

33
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:27,416
Here it comes.

34
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:33,708
Are you positive we can
trust this information?

35
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:36,500
I mean, they're
cyber-terrorists, aren't they?

36
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:38,291
Getting into bed
with people like this.

37
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:39,958
It just seems risky that's all.

38
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:42,083
They probably just
feel sorry for Japan.

39
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:44,916
We were put under a
global intelligence blockade.

40
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,708
You should be glad
they're giving us a leg up.

41
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,083
This is intel the U.S.

42
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:58,208
military has been
stonewalling us on forever.

43
00:03:58,291 --> 00:03:59,625
How'd they get it?

44
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:00,500
I don't know.

45
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:02,333
And honestly, I don't care.

46
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:03,791
We need to make the
most of this moment,

47
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:05,541
for the sake of Japan.

48
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:08,916
This may be the only
chance our generation gets.

49
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:39,833
Come on.

50
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:41,000
It's time to get training.

51
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:43,833
You've been slacking
off for long enough.

52
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:45,666
This is more fun
than running maneuvers.

53
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,750
Come on in, the water's fine.

54
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:50,916
Laps in the pool aren't
going to help me fly better.

55
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,750
Oh, right, a thousand pardons.

56
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:56,500
I forgot someone's in a hurry
to rescue his girlfriend.

57
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,583
Naru is not my girlfriend, okay?

58
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:00,791
Of course.

59
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:02,000
My mistake.

60
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,166
What've you got
against pools, Ao?

61
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,375
Did you eat a weird
fruit and now you sink?

62
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:10,000
What're you talking about?

63
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:11,041
Scandalous!

64
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:12,750
So you don't know how to swim?

65
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:14,125
Well!

66
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:16,833
If I ever catch you drowning,
you're on your own!

67
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:17,916
Get real.

68
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,416
I've been swimming
since I was a kid.

69
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:23,750
We just got a heads-up

70
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:27,291
from someone in Japan's
Ministry of Self-Defense.

71
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:29,333
You have folks in the
Japanese government?

72
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:30,958
Got to admit, I'm impressed.

73
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:33,291
There's no way of knowing
if it'll actually work

74
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,208
but it seems they intend
to run an experiment

75
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:38,750
to artificially
create a Scub Burst.

76
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:41,208
We can't allow Japan
to have a Coral plant.

77
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:43,208
Maintaining global
equilibrium dictates

78
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:45,958
that we prevent that
by any means possible.

79
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:47,708
Enter Team Pied Piper.

80
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:51,083
Our company's wunderkind when it
comes to getting the job done.

81
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:52,708
I assume that means
you're ordering us

82
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:55,541
to go in there and take
out the Quartz on the sly?

83
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:56,791
Please, Ivica.

84
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:58,375
Why would you put words
in my mouth like that?

85
00:05:58,458 --> 00:05:59,333
What?

86
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:01,208
Hurry it up, kids.

87
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:07,666
Well that's the long and
the short of it, at least.

88
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,208
I'll instruct the
more-than-capable

89
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:12,500
on-site staff to pass
along all the details.

90
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:15,583
I understand.

91
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:23,541
I figured I'd see
the sites, you know?

92
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:36,666
Yeah, so my mom got
remarried to some Swiss guy.

93
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,083
And being around all that,

94
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:42,000
Swiss gave me this weird kind
of Okinawan accent, see.

95
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,125
So, this is Japan, huh?

96
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:52,916
To think than an Okinawan
like me would have

97
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,875
to come by way of Switzerland
just to get in here.

98
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,916
The customs
agents are dinosaurs.

99
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,166
It felt like I was in a museum.

100
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:07,250
What do we do now?

101
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:10,291
Now we get our asses on a train.

102
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:12,958
Time to get our Shinkansen on.

103
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:20,958
I guess Tokyo used to
be on the other side

104
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:23,875
of that thing, back in the day.

105
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:26,833
Yup, that Scub Burst 70 years
ago was the knockout punch

106
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:29,875
to post-war Japan's
rebuilding and recovery efforts.

107
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:32,125
Like things weren't bad before.

108
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,541
Light emission confirmed.

109
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:58,500
Water temperature
has begun to rise.

110
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:02,333
The broken Quartz seems
to be beginning to fuse.

111
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:05,291
Good!

112
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,458
The reactivation
has been a success!

113
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:10,916
This is a momentous day.

114
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,958
Japan will finally
have a Coral plant.

115
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:15,208
With all due respect, sir,

116
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:18,500
this is just the first
part of the operation.

117
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:22,708
I believe he's trying to tell
you that the fun's not over.

118
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:27,125
They're all saying the
test was a big success.

119
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:29,000
Light emission confirmed.

120
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:31,708
It matches the spectral
signature of Quartz.

121
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:33,833
Has the Scub manifested yet?

122
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:36,750
Patch me through to
Team Pied Piper, now.

123
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:50,333
Round and round you go, Noa!

124
00:08:58,166 --> 00:08:59,458
Hey Rebecka, how long do we have

125
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:00,916
to sit out here doing nothing?

126
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,125
You'll sit until we
give you the green light.

127
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:04,875
You'll approach by sea
when the time comes,

128
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:07,458
so waiting there makes sense.

129
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:08,666
Rebecka failed to
mention that we are on

130
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:11,625
the very edge of Japan's
territorial waters.

131
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:12,958
This is as close as we can be

132
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:15,000
without its armed
forces engaging us.

133
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:16,500
The submarines
patrolling their waters

134
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:17,291
are likely armed with...

135
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:18,583
Anyway.

136
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:20,791
Looks like their eggheads
pulled off the test.

137
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:24,500
They just made a
Scub Burst, so get ready.

138
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,208
Secret incoming, Chief.

139
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:42,166
What the hell was that?

140
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,708
That's a Secret manifesting!

141
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,916
Down in the water,
near the test site!

142
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,208
Remain calm!

143
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:49,750
We will now commence
with capturing the Secret!

144
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:52,416
Check all of the
equipment at the test site!

145
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:53,583
What?

146
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:54,708
Are you mad?

147
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:57,166
Why should our needs
be filled by IFOs

148
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:58,500
when the weapons carried

149
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:01,083
by the Secrets themselves
pack so much of a punch?

150
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:02,416
Not to worry.

151
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,750
It'll head straight to the
Coral just like always.

152
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:07,000
We'll be perfectly safe
here in the command center.

153
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:13,166
The Kazusa has taken
extensive damage to her hull!

154
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,333
Your Secret just
tore the hell out of it!

155
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:18,583
Huh?

156
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:25,583
So uh fellas, I think that
thing's ignoring the bait.

157
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:35,916
Your theater for this mission

158
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,833
will be the southern
section of Tokyo Bay,

159
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:41,291
near the submarine canyon that
connects to the Sagami Trough.

160
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:43,041
The waters of
Tokyo Bay are generally

161
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:44,625
no deeper than 20 meters,

162
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:47,416
but this mission will take you
to depths far exceeding that.

163
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,625
At times, you'll be maneuvering

164
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:50,833
500 meters below the surface.

165
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,416
The water pressure
at such depths

166
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,958
could possibly damage
portions of your IFO,

167
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:56,250
beginning with the
outer extremities

168
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:58,416
and working inward to the frame.

169
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,625
Your IFOs should be kept
in their flight configurations

170
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:03,791
until such time as
environmental conditions

171
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:05,833
no longer prove injurious.

172
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:07,083
Then you may switch

173
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,958
to their humanoid
configurations forthwith.

174
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:10,875
In other words,
don't transform too soon

175
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:12,291
or your craft will implode.

176
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:13,583
You have got to be kidding me!

177
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:16,041
I hope the Secret's
polite enough to sit back

178
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:17,833
and let us get ready to fight.

179
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:19,625
I don't get it, Chief.

180
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:21,333
If underwater is so dangerous,

181
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:24,541
why don't we just surface and
fight the Secret up there?

182
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:27,750
Eliminating the Secret is not
the objective of this operation.

183
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:29,833
You'll be dealing
directly with the Scub.

184
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:31,333
Huh?

185
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:34,000
Getting the Quartz outta the
Scub is priority number one.

186
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:36,875
The Secret is raising hell
towards the JAF base right now,

187
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:38,333
which helps us out.

188
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:40,833
You'll slip in, right to
the Scub Coral's point

189
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:42,833
of occurrence,
and eighty-six it.

190
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:44,791
Then it's simply a matter
of grabbing the Quartz

191
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:46,375
and returning to headquarters.

192
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:49,208
Roger that Chief.

193
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,583
So, what is this
"Quartz" thing, anyway?

194
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:53,625
A crystal found in every Scub.

195
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:56,625
They're the reason the Secrets
make a beeline for the Coral.

196
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:58,500
Is that the stuff
we were transporting

197
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:00,208
when everything went to hell?

198
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:01,708
Yeah.

199
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:04,208
The Secret goes for the Quartz
like a bloodhound at least

200
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:06,750
that's what the Generation Bleu
guys think, anyway.

201
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:08,666
And all that Quartz they take?

202
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:11,583
It's sitting pretty inside some
closet back at headquarters.

203
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:13,375
But, why would they keep it?

204
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:15,666
Damned if I know.

205
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,541
Wait, are you telling me
that collecting the Quartz

206
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:19,500
has been Generation
Bleu's top priority

207
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,583
on all of the missions
it's been running?

208
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:23,416
It's our top priority now.

209
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,291
Look, Japan's playing with
fire with these experiments.

210
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:29,041
We got to deprive them of
that Scub for the greater good.

211
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:30,666
What about saving people?

212
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,791
Once the three of you
have retrieved the Quartz,

213
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:34,625
the Scub Burst will stabilize.

214
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:37,416
The faster you do that,
the fewer casualties.

215
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,000
Oh, how caring of you.

216
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:41,166
Ao, don't waste your breath.

217
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:42,375
They've all forgotten these

218
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:44,333
are real people we're
talking about here.

219
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:47,041
Yup-yup, war is a
hard business, guys.

220
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:48,958
Look, we can't let the
Japanese get their hands

221
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:51,000
on a homegrown source of Trapar.

222
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:52,583
As a native Okinawan,

223
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:54,875
I would think you'd understand
that fact better than anyone.

224
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:56,291
People are dying, dammit!

225
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,666
I don't care if they're
Japanese or Okinawan or what!

226
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:01,208
I'm not going to
sit back and watch!

227
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,041
Ao!

228
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:09,541
Back in formation!

229
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:13,416
Alleluia and Kyrie you're
both still on Quartz retrieval.

230
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,250
Roger that, Chief.

231
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:16,625
We're on it.

232
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:21,416
Forget eavesdropping
on them from far away!

233
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,500
Let's just barge onto their base

234
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:24,333
while everybody
there's all distracted!

235
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:25,750
That's a great
idea, really, man!

236
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:28,041
But don't kill us on the way!

237
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,875
Land-based cars are for geezers!

238
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:35,375
How does anybody drive them?

239
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:53,875
An explosion at the port.

240
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,583
Of course!

241
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:58,291
The Secret must be down
in the water over there!

242
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:09,791
Son of a!

243
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:12,458
That was the
Mark I that flew by!

244
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,875
What's going on?

245
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:21,541
Why did you stop?

246
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:30,125
Not to split hairs,
but that was my Nirvash.

247
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:32,416
Who, are you?

248
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,625
You employed my
intel to good effect.

249
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:35,958
I'm very grateful.

250
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:39,541
So you're my
contact in Firecracker?

251
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:40,583
Call me Truth.

252
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:42,291
I insist.

253
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:40,500
Stupid ground cars!

254
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:50,541
My head's killing me!

255
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:56,750
You're the guy who
blew up the john.

256
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,208
This crazy crap going on.

257
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:10,458
You did all this, huh?

258
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:31,666
Hey, Chief!

259
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:34,708
This isn't Scub Coral!

260
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,541
It's Damaged Quartz.

261
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:39,791
How'd they get their
hands on so much of it?

262
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:42,208
And what's that
light it's giving off?

263
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:44,291
The fragments have
been reactivated.

264
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:47,833
Damaged Quartz comprises the
empty shell of a Scub Burst.

265
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:49,208
Given the amount
we're seeing here,

266
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:52,666
and the fact it's in Japan,
one can assume this is--

267
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,583
This is what remains
of the post-war burst

268
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:57,250
from 70 years ago.

269
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:59,208
If you gather enough
Damaged Quartz

270
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:03,541
in one place the
results are explosive.

271
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:05,666
I hoped that a
Secret would manifest,

272
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,708
to kick off the festivities.

273
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:13,166
Mission accomplished.

274
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:16,708
So your game is fake quartz?

275
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,125
Then all along, it was you!

276
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:26,875
Where'd it go?

277
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:37,916
Let me go, dammit!

278
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,500
This is bad!

279
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,416
The water pressure's going to
crush Nirvash like a tin can!

280
00:17:57,625 --> 00:17:58,916
I lost it!

281
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:07,291
Show yourself,
you sneaky bastard!

282
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:08,583
Next time, just ask me for help!

283
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:09,791
Fair enough!

284
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:14,166
Fleur!

285
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:18,541
Okay!

286
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:19,791
How do you track this thing?

287
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:24,208
That's it?

288
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:28,416
Now I get it!

289
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:39,750
What are you doing?

290
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:46,541
Do I look like a Secret?

291
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:54,083
Bring it!

292
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:36,375
But I won!

293
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:38,541
I'm still going to die?

294
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:43,250
Not like this!

295
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:08,333
What?

296
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:25,666
So much for that
tough talk at the pool

297
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,416
about letting him drown.

298
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:29,416
I forgot.

299
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:33,250
Answer me.

300
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:36,625
Were you the person who hired
us to transport that stuff?

301
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:41,458
You demand the truth of me,
but you can't even see it.

302
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:43,041
The hell I can't!

303
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:44,958
The truth reveals
itself only to those

304
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:47,875
who are courageous
enough to embrace it.

305
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:06,791
Hey, how'd you know the Secret

306
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:09,666
was drawn to the
Trapars in our IFOs?

307
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,416
I just saw it.

308
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,916
What was it like
when you saw it?

309
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,416
Did it feel like a
super-power or what?

310
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,791
That is so cool!

311
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:19,041
It's like your eyes are magical!

312
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:22,125
I tried to see an
answer, and then I did.

313
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:25,916
I can't really
put it into words.

314
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:32,125
I trust you've
learned your lesson?

315
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:35,958
Japan has no need for your
brand of military recklessness.

316
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:39,458
We may be poor, but at
least we're still in one piece.

317
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:13,666
You again!

318
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,291
Whose side are you on?

319
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:17,625
Are you for me or against me?

320
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:21,583
Why content yourself
with changing this country?

321
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:24,625
Why aim so small?

322
00:22:24,708 --> 00:22:25,833
When the truth of the matter

323
00:22:25,916 --> 00:22:28,041
is there's a whole
