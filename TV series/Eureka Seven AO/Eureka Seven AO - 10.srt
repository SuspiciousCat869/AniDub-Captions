1
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,583
Roughly eight hours ago,
a Scub Burst occurred

2
00:01:57,666 --> 00:02:00,791
in the suburbs of
Phoenix, Arizona.

3
00:02:00,875 --> 00:02:02,416
The United States military made

4
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,041
a concerted effort to
intercept the Secret.

5
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:08,333
Unfortunately,
the operation failed.

6
00:02:08,416 --> 00:02:09,375
That's a first, right?

7
00:02:09,458 --> 00:02:10,958
For them to have
Scub Burst, I mean?

8
00:02:11,041 --> 00:02:12,583
It is, really?

9
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:18,125
Incorrect, the US has, in fact,
had several Scub Bursts.

10
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:19,375
They are infrequent, though.

11
00:02:19,458 --> 00:02:22,000
They couldn't neutralize
the Secret on their own.

12
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:26,333
Then surely, they'll be sending
us a request to mobilize soon.

13
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:27,791
I doubt this particular country

14
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:30,833
will be seeking
Generation Bleu's assistance.

15
00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:32,416
Yes, that may be the case.

16
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,333
Thank goodness
for loopholes, right?

17
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:49,666
Pied Piper is currently
on standby in Mexico,

18
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:52,458
across the border from
your great state of Arizona.

19
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:55,541
All you have to do is invoke
your power as governor

20
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:58,291
and issue a request
for us to mobilize.

21
00:02:58,375 --> 00:03:01,041
That seems simple enough, huh?

22
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:03,500
I often find that the
simpler the matter,

23
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:06,541
the more people are to
inclined to argue about it.

24
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:08,291
You understand, right?

25
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:09,416
I owe it to my people

26
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,083
to consider all the
options available.

27
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:15,375
You kept us waiting just to
deliver that line of crap?

28
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:20,541
I'm curious, Rebecka,
what do you think?

29
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:21,708
You look well, by the way.

30
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:22,708
Thank you.

31
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:23,416
Hey!

32
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,958
What's all this about?

33
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:26,750
You work directly under
the company president,

34
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:28,791
so I'm sure you know.

35
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,916
Rebecka's appointment comes from
higher up on the food chain.

36
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,833
Yeah, and what of it?

37
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:35,083
You know, as well,

38
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:36,833
that Generation Bleu is
owned by the PR Company,

39
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:39,500
the largest corporation
in the United States.

40
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:41,708
What you may not
know is that I also

41
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:44,916
worked with them before
I got into politics.

42
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,916
You see Rebecka and
I were colleagues there,

43
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,458
once upon a time.

44
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:51,416
Ours was a very
fruitful partnership.

45
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,458
You know what our greatest
accomplishment was?

46
00:03:56,541 --> 00:04:00,750
Together, she and I wiped
an entire country off the map.

47
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:04,000
Smoldering antagonism
between two ethnic groups

48
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:06,583
in the Balkan Peninsula
became a full-blown conflict

49
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:09,208
when a Scub Burst occurred.

50
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:10,541
The losing side got to watch

51
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:14,166
as their country was
dismantled, brick by brick.

52
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:18,666
And nobody in the global
community came to their defense.

53
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,875
I remember history
class, thanks.

54
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:22,500
The country that
lost that conflict

55
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:24,583
was trying to commit genocide.

56
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:26,750
Who would defend them?

57
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:31,166
That so-called genocide
was nothing more than

58
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:34,416
an illusion manufactured
by the PR Company.

59
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,750
You mean?

60
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:37,833
There was no good or evil
side in that conflict.

61
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:39,708
What?

62
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:44,458
However, people hesitate to act
unless that distinction is made.

63
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:47,958
Made by you and the PR Company?

64
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:50,666
You haven't changed
a bit, Barry.

65
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,916
Oh, and I suppose you have?

66
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,833
I would like to think
I have actually.

67
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:57,833
You're kidding yourself.

68
00:04:57,916 --> 00:04:59,583
Very little separates
what you do now

69
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,458
from what you did back then.

70
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:03,375
Think about it.

71
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:05,000
Even now, you're working
behind the scenes

72
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:06,958
to get me to do what you want.

73
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:12,583
Noa!

74
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:14,750
You're not supposed to be here!

75
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:19,916
<i>The Pied Piper of Hamelin.</i>

76
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,750
Oh, that story
about the violinist?

77
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:23,333
Not everything's a manga.

78
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:26,583
The Pied Piper of Hamelin is a
folktale based on actual events

79
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:29,041
that occurred in
Lower Saxony, Germany....

80
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:31,291
So this is what the
team is named after?

81
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:33,750
That seems kind of
strange, doesn't it?

82
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,708
Who came up with it, anyway?

83
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:37,958
I'm pretty sure
it was the Chief.

84
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:39,083
Do you know why?

85
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:40,125
No.

86
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:42,583
Continuing on!

87
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:44,916
Several different
interpretations of the story

88
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,625
have been put forth.

89
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:49,250
One posits that the piper
represents the grim reaper, and

90
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:52,000
the story itself is a metaphor
for the high mortality rate

91
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:55,083
of children during a
plague or other catastrophe.

92
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:57,666
Another potential explanation
is that the story alludes to the

93
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:01,458
participation of children in a
pilgrimage or military action.

94
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:04,958
Perhaps even the infamous
Children's Crusade.

95
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:07,875
Finally, a third theory
put forth in the latter half

96
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:10,041
of the twentieth century
suggests that the story

97
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:12,500
may be a reference
to colonization.

98
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:14,458
Several villages
founded in Eastern Europe

99
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,666
during this period, might
possibly have been established

100
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,833
by people originally
from Hamelin.

101
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:21,666
These colonizers could be
seen as Hamelin's "children."

102
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,875
The theory postulates
that the pied piper

103
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:25,750
represents their
leader and that--

104
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:27,958
The US military is on the move.

105
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,666
They've begun the second
wave of their attack.

106
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:52,000
A direct assault
by the infantry?

107
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:55,208
The ZOA created by
this Secret is believed

108
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:56,583
to be quite a bit larger than

109
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,625
what we are used
to seeing from them.

110
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:00,916
The US primary force
approached carelessly

111
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,625
and was wiped out.

112
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:05,708
They're relatively inexperienced
in anti-Secret combat.

113
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:09,166
Likely, they want to avoid
additional loss of IFOs.

114
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:11,583
So this was their
brilliant solution.

115
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:14,291
If the Secret reacts to
IFOs and other aircraft,

116
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:15,833
why not see what
happens if you send in

117
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:19,041
flesh and blood
soldiers to deal with it?

118
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:24,083
I'm leaving my post.

119
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:26,875
And where do you
think you're going?

120
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:29,583
I'll rendezvous with
the US forces deployed

121
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:33,083
at the site and offer
my advice to them directly.

122
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:35,208
This is where you laugh
and say, "just kidding."

123
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:37,916
You're an employee
of this company.

124
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,333
I'm taking independent action.

125
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:41,166
Sorry.

126
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,041
Hey! Come back, Ivica!

127
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:52,000
Once we cross the border,

128
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:55,916
fabricate an identification
code and dodge immigration.

129
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,625
It can be done, of course,
but it will be illegal.

130
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:01,500
As stipulated under United
States Immigration Control Law--

131
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:03,250
Skip the lecture and just do it!

132
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:04,750
Roger that, sir!

133
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,083
Sorry for this.

134
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:11,333
It isn't like you
forced me to come along.

135
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:14,333
You needed someone to
drive, and I volunteered.

136
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:16,583
And besides.

137
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:17,625
What is it?

138
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:19,750
I wanted to see
what you were up to.

139
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,583
It's unusual for you
to defy the president.

140
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:25,125
The US military
might be reckless,

141
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:27,541
but not to this great a degree.

142
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:29,750
They wouldn't send
infantry against a Secret

143
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:33,875
unless such an operation had
been considered in advance.

144
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:37,000
So does that mean they're
basing it on an experiment?

145
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,666
My gut tells me
something's wrong.

146
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,541
Yours too, right Ao?

147
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:57,666
Chief!

148
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,166
There!

149
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:17,250
We're Generation Bleu.

150
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:19,791
You should have orders
to start evacuating.

151
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:21,875
What are you just
standing there for?

152
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:27,791
Chief. Something isn't right.

153
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:28,541
Yeah.

154
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:29,125
It's him!

155
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:30,625
He's crazy!

156
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:33,291
That bastard threatened us
and forced us to gather here!

157
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:35,125
Why won't you let us go?

158
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:39,000
I assure you,
your sacrifice is vital.

159
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:41,791
It will reveal the
truth about the Secrets.

160
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:46,666
He's behind this?

161
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:50,416
Give Naru back, you bastard!

162
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,083
Ao, no!

163
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,125
It seems the second wave

164
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:18,583
of attack has failed
miserably, as well.

165
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,083
They met with
unexpected opposition.

166
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,375
The whole unit was annihilated.

167
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:28,541
So, in light of this
new development,

168
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:31,458
are you prepared to have a
serious discussion with us?

169
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:33,708
"Unexpected opposition"?

170
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:35,291
Sorry if I'm being vague.

171
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:37,583
I don't have the
details yet, either.

172
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:41,666
Now, then.

173
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,583
Regardless of what's
happened, the authority to

174
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:46,541
call in Generation Bleu
still lies with me.

175
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:49,333
As you say, it's my
prerogative as governor.

176
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:50,708
Seriously?

177
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:53,583
With all this going on,
you're still playing games?

178
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:06,000
Truth!

179
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:09,958
I don't believe it!

180
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:11,166
How could this happen?

181
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,250
What's going on?

182
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:14,166
Hey, Chief!

183
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,458
Where did that ba--?

184
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:23,833
What the hell?

185
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:24,625
Impossible!

186
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:26,500
Did that monster do this?

187
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:44,541
Take cover inside that building!

188
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,916
Everyone! Hurry! Get inside!

189
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,666
Stay calm!

190
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,916
The Secret will
not come after us!

191
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,166
They only react to aircraft!

192
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,000
Not to flesh and blood!

193
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:10,541
See, we can do it!

194
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:44,208
What do think you're doing, Ao?

195
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:45,708
Pull it together!

196
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:57,875
You blind,
ignorant little people.

197
00:12:57,958 --> 00:13:00,583
You have no idea
what Secrets truly are.

198
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:04,583
They're out there.

199
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:06,250
Those things are
still looking for us!

200
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:08,500
Why doesn't
someone call for help?

201
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:09,833
We can't reach our main unit

202
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:12,208
unless we get back
to our choppers.

203
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:14,291
Hush, little one.

204
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:15,625
It's okay.

205
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:19,458
No matter what happens,
Mommy will be here.

206
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:21,125
I'll protect you, sweetie.

207
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,958
The Secret attacked humans?

208
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:26,458
Yes, that's right.

209
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:28,666
After the infantry assault,
it seems the Secret learned

210
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:31,916
to identify humans
themselves as hostile.

211
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,250
It doesn't matter what
kind of weapons they carry.

212
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:36,625
The Secret won't discriminate.

213
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:39,708
So this is the unexpected
opposition he was talking about.

214
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:40,500
Our guys?

215
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:41,708
You mean Ao and The Chief?

216
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:42,541
Oh crap!

217
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:43,916
We haven't heard from them.

218
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,333
Just speed up your
negotiations with the governor.

219
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:50,166
I'll let you decide what
compromises need to be made.

220
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,416
Compromises, huh?

221
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,208
This is out of
character for you.

222
00:13:57,291 --> 00:14:00,000
What is it about this
that's got you spooked?

223
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:03,333
I am not spooked, thank you.

224
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:06,166
It's Ivica, isn't it?

225
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,250
Yeah, I know the backstory.

226
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:12,583
About what happened to
the old man's homeland.

227
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:28,583
It's my fault you're
caught up in all this.

228
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:31,250
I'm sorry.

229
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:40,958
Maybe you already know this,

230
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:44,458
but I'm the one who
named the team Pied Piper.

231
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:47,833
The country I'm
from no longer exists.

232
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:51,666
In a way, it was our own fault.

233
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,250
We were so focused
on our problems;

234
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:56,666
we didn't notice the
world turning against us.

235
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:59,250
My wife and child
were both killed,

236
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:01,708
caught in the fighting.

237
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:05,083
Countless other lives
were lost in that conflict.

238
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:08,541
Even so, I have no
right to blame the enemy.

239
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:12,708
We would have done
the same to them.

240
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:15,041
I took Generation Bleu's
offer in order to atone

241
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:17,333
for my part in all of it.

242
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:22,250
But, only children
could pilot the IFOs.

243
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:25,500
And just like that,
I became the pied piper.

244
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:29,291
I play my pipe and send
you kids off into battle.

245
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:32,250
I don't know what became
of the children of Hamelin,

246
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:35,416
but I won't let the
kids in my charge die.

247
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:05,916
I'm going out there as bait.

248
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,791
Use that chance to get
everybody out of here.

249
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:10,916
But if you go out
there you'll die!

250
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:16,250
Ao!

251
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:47,166
I, I did it!

252
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,833
What the hell was that?

253
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,375
An experiment.

254
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:54,750
An experiment?

255
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:58,958
Upstairs, I saw
all these mannequins

256
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:00,625
that had been destroyed.

257
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:02,208
Mannequins?

258
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:06,958
Are those bastards identifying
humans by shape alone?

259
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:10,875
That's what I was testing by
running out there with the tent.

260
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:13,625
That was beyond reckless!

261
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:15,916
Yeah, well!

262
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,958
So what?

263
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:18,583
It did work, didn't it?

264
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:23,625
We can save these people!

265
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:25,708
Listen up!

266
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:28,416
Just trust us and
follow our lead!

267
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,750
We're getting out alive.

268
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:32,458
The Chief and I are
going to make sure of it.

269
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:34,916
I promise we will.

270
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,916
Because we're Pied Piper!

271
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:47,375
This is it!

272
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:49,166
Follow me, everyone.

273
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,000
Let me talk to him alone.

274
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:02,125
Huh?

275
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,375
Give us a minute.

276
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:20,625
Working together,
you and I once had

277
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:24,958
the ability to erase
an entire country.

278
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:29,750
Don't try to tell me
that things have changed.

279
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:35,916
This time, it'll be the whole
world we're manipulating.

280
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,208
I will happily issue a request
for Generation Bleu to mobilize.

281
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:41,958
However.

282
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:44,041
I have some conditions.

283
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:47,000
From now on, Generation
Bleu will support my--

284
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:56,750
You were saying
about conditions?

285
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:01,208
The Arizona governor has
requested mobilization.

286
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:03,458
Launch the Triton immediately.

287
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:07,541
After picking up Ivica, Rebecka,
and Ao, neutralize the Secret.

288
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:13,125
Get out of here
as fast as you can.

289
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:15,291
Take everyone to safety!

290
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:16,541
Roger.

291
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:20,750
And again, Generation Bleu
has our sincere gratitude.

292
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:25,208
The Triton is
approaching your location.

293
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:27,458
So they managed
to get the request.

294
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:30,333
We have to hurry up
and destroy that Secret.

295
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:33,166
It'll be a massacre if
it reaches an urban area.

296
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:37,083
I think I have an idea.

297
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:47,208
We're in the ZOA
at this distance?

298
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:49,625
Have we made it to the
rendezvous point yet?

299
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:51,416
A little further.

300
00:19:58,041 --> 00:19:59,208
Here it comes.

301
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:07,750
We were right!

302
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:09,500
The Nirvash is human-shaped,

303
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,958
so the Secret
recognized it as hostile.

304
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:19,875
Damn!

305
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:21,208
I can't get through to it!

306
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:28,375
He can't get in close enough.

307
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:31,375
But there's another
way to do this.

308
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:33,125
Can you both hear me?

309
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:34,750
When the Secret
releases its options,

310
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:38,083
it opens its mouth,
that's our chance.

311
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:40,208
Hit it with all the
firepower you've got!

312
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:42,000
What happens after that?

313
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:43,333
Leave it to me!

314
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:45,708
Chief, you're going to--!

315
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,291
Chief?

316
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:01,041
Good!

317
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:02,541
Do it now!

318
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,500
Chief!

319
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,541
Whatever you may have
learned about her past,

320
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:45,000
don't speak of it again.

321
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:47,041
Not even to Rebecka herself.

322
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:50,000
Really?

323
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:51,833
You just want me
to leave it at that?

324
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:53,958
People are able change.

325
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:56,958
That's all there is to it.

326
00:21:58,333 --> 00:22:00,875
Sure, whatever you say.

327
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:03,041
Her guilt is what's driving her.

328
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:04,791
You know that, right?

329
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:05,625
Hey!

330
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:07,791
What are you talking about?

331
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:16,250
What's wrong?

332
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:20,750
These children need
their pied piper, you know.

333
00:22:20,833 --> 00:22:23,125
For their sake, be careful.

334
00:22:23,958 --> 00:22:26,541
The pied piper, huh?

335
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:30,958
You know, I think this time
around the pipe players,

336
00:22:31,041 --> 00:22:32,916
were actually the children.

337
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,708
To be continued!

338
00:24:12,791 --> 00:24:15,541
Next time on Eureka Seven AO.

339
00:24:15,625 --> 00:24:17,625
One girl's past, is
brought to the surface

340
00:24:17,708 --> 00:24:20,083
by unseen intruders
from another land.

341
00:24:20,166 --> 00:24:22,625
When she looks in the
mirror, who does she see?

342
00:24:22,708 --> 00:24:24,291
When self wars against self,

343
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:28,583
which identity will be the one
to grasp the truth in her hands?

344
00:24:28,666 --> 00:24:33,291
Eureka Seven AO, Episode 11:
"mirror of the world."

345
00:24:33,375 --> 00:24:35,833
Hear the cry of the
children of the stars.
