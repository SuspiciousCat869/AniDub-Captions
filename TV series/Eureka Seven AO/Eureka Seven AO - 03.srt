1
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:46,333
So, are you going
to pilot it again?

2
00:01:46,416 --> 00:01:49,916
No, not anymore.

3
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,291
Why not?

4
00:01:51,375 --> 00:01:54,125
Everybody else,
they'll hate me more.

5
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:57,500
I never did anything wrong.

6
00:01:57,583 --> 00:02:01,333
But people always treated
me like some foreign freak

7
00:02:01,416 --> 00:02:07,083
and I thought it was only
natural but, I've had enough.

8
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:09,458
Ao.

9
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:11,041
I mean, after all.

10
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:13,208
I'm a middle schooler now.

11
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:31,125
Whoa!

12
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:33,250
Kusaremaguro's new song!

13
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:34,791
Awesome!

14
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:53,416
Yes, yes!

15
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,541
Just a sec, I'm coming!

16
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:56,375
Fleur!

17
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:57,708
Why are you doing that here?

18
00:02:57,791 --> 00:03:00,291
I can update my blog
from wherever I want.

19
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:01,083
Hey, Chief!

20
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:02,750
Can't you answer that?

21
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:04,000
I really can't move.

22
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:06,208
This coffee cup's quite full.

23
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:09,208
Yes, this is the Triton.

24
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:10,416
State your business.

25
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,875
I'm really sorry.

26
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:17,250
I got myself in
a bit of a pickle.

27
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:28,125
There we go!

28
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:31,083
It's Dad, he doesn't like Noa,
so I had to hide her in here.

29
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:37,666
Get that off your head, Noa!

30
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:43,833
So, what are you
going to do now?

31
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:45,750
I'm not sure.

32
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:46,916
The way I look now,

33
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,083
I'll stand out
no matter where I go.

34
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:51,208
Over there!

35
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:52,333
Catch him!

36
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:54,208
Quick!

37
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:55,458
Naru!

38
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:56,458
Father, stop it!

39
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:58,250
What is this?

40
00:03:58,333 --> 00:03:59,416
I swear Naru.

41
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,041
You know animal fur's
not good for you!

42
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:02,666
Hey, what are you doing?

43
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,791
Father, no!
You have to make them stop!

44
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:07,666
Naru, no!

45
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:08,916
Come on!

46
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,666
We need to get back to
the hospital right now!

47
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,208
So it is true, then.

48
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:22,083
Blue hair, just like her!

49
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:24,041
There are people coming.

50
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:25,666
Bring the boy to my studio.

51
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,000
Right.

52
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:33,291
Noa.

53
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:37,250
Ao.

54
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:41,166
That was a clever move.

55
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,333
Nobody from outside the island

56
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:45,083
would even know
about this place.

57
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:47,791
But anybody who
grew up here would.

58
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:50,083
All of us played here
when we were kids.

59
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,333
It's no use.

60
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:53,916
It won't start.

61
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,750
Does it have some special lock
because it belongs to the JAF?

62
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:59,000
It's not really theirs.

63
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:01,791
The rumor is, they bought
up parts in storage.

64
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:03,208
From France and the U.S.

65
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:06,500
A hybrid or maybe you would
call it a tri-brid, huh?

66
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:07,666
Move over, Pippo.

67
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,416
Fine, try it.

68
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,250
You won't have any luck. 

69
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:14,958
Why isn't anything working?

70
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:17,875
How'd the brat get it to go?

71
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:19,666
The thing about that kid,

72
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:23,000
he was flying FPs before
he was in grade school.

73
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:25,291
Didn't even need to be taught.

74
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:32,125
Where are you going?

75
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,625
Getting the guy who can work it.

76
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:38,291
But didn't he say that he
wouldn't fly it anymore?

77
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:39,708
He's wrong.

78
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:41,833
He will pilot it again.

79
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:45,791
I've seen you on the news.

80
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:47,916
You guys are the real deal, huh?

81
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,375
"General" no, "Generation."

82
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:51,750
"Generation Bleu"!

83
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:54,666
Really, it isn't that
hard to remember.

84
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:55,958
Oh, yeah.

85
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:58,958
You specialize in
defeating G-Monsters, right?

86
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:01,541
You're really famous.

87
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:03,916
You're from Pied Piper!

88
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,708
You help people who
are in trouble right?

89
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:08,083
Yeah, we sure do.

90
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:11,250
Please help my mama!

91
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:13,333
She's trapped over there!

92
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:16,333
One, two, three.

93
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:20,541
Young lady, these people have
already finished their job.

94
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:23,208
Go on.

95
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:24,208
But Chief!

96
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:25,250
It's all right.

97
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:27,541
We can handle the negotiations.

98
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:32,250
Wait here, I'll go get Alleluia!

99
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:33,583
Alleluia?

100
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:35,166
That's my IFO!

101
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:40,166
So it's true the IFOs
haf'ta be operated by children?

102
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,625
I guess that makes sense.

103
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:43,208
What with Ao last night.

104
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:45,625
Hmm, Ao?

105
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:48,750
Might that be the pilot
of the IFO we saw yesterday?

106
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:50,291
Oh well, uh...

107
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:51,583
That's just a rumor.

108
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:54,708
Is that so?

109
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:56,458
Maybe you can fill me in.

110
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:59,166
What about our meeting
with the SDF, Chief?

111
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,666
They won't be serving
drinks, will they?

112
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,750
It's all yours, Deputy Chief.

113
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,750
You see, to us here
on the United Okinawa

114
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:12,375
and Ryukyu islands,
that's a rare Scub Coral.

115
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:14,375
Only the second we've secured.

116
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:17,541
So we can't grant you access
for your "investigation."

117
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:20,875
But the Scub Coral hasn't
been completely destroyed.

118
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:23,958
If it's left alone, then
another Secret will appear.

119
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:25,791
Oh, yes, I forgot.

120
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:28,125
That's what you
high-browed, scholarly types

121
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:30,083
like to call the
G-Monsters, right?

122
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:31,833
Secret, huh?

123
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:33,250
Well, whatever the term is,

124
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:34,458
I've never heard
of one appearing

125
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:36,958
in the same place
more than once.

126
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:38,541
You're done here.

127
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,791
We would like you
to leave immediately.

128
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,791
Have you finished
your chat with the SDF?

129
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:52,916
I've come here to
claim Elena Peoples,

130
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,125
a member of Team Pied Piper.

131
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:58,041
Meet up with Fleur.

132
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:00,791
Covertly monitor the
Scub Coral from the sea.

133
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:02,083
Yes, ma'am.

134
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:04,250
But what about you though?

135
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:06,500
I'll be there soon.

136
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:08,166
One song.

137
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:16,250
The Quartz is still out there.

138
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:19,125
And that means another
Secret will come for sure.

139
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:56,000
An alien working as
a spy for the JAF?

140
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:58,291
Tell us about the giant!

141
00:08:58,375 --> 00:08:59,833
The giant.

142
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:03,041
You talking about
the Sea Colossus?

143
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,333
It's a big boulder.

144
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:08,708
No, the other thing,
the one you flew!

145
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:20,833
It's been a long time, Ao.

146
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:23,833
Have we met before?

147
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:25,333
You don't remember?

148
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:30,083
Well, it was ten years ago
that I used to go to Dr. Fukai.

149
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:32,666
Back when your
mother still lived here.

150
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,583
I want to ask you something.

151
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:39,833
Why do you hate me so much?

152
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:43,333
I said it over and over.

153
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,166
We shouldn't get
involved with her.

154
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,541
The woman from the sky.

155
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:51,625
Amazing.

156
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:54,500
It's been thirteen
years already.

157
00:09:54,583 --> 00:10:00,000
And, you know, your father,
he saw it as well.

158
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:02,833
What happened that day.

159
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:17,083
It was a bright, clear day.

160
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:19,708
And suddenly, out of nowhere,

161
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:23,125
Ao's mother fell from the sky.

162
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:37,166
Let's go!

163
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:44,708
It was before we'd
become independent.

164
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:47,625
The Americans came
looking for her.

165
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:53,166
But Toshio Fukai gave her
refuge, and Ao was born.

166
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:56,916
The people of the island
suspected that they were aliens.

167
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,916
So they hate Ao because of it?

168
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,125
That's awful!

169
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:02,166
No!

170
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:05,916
That family brought
misfortune with them!

171
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,250
They angered the Sea Colossus!

172
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:11,541
The Sea Colossus?

173
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:30,208
You were about three years old.

174
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:31,458
That's when it happened:

175
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:33,791
there was a Scub Burst
near the main island.

176
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:36,375
You can still see its remains.

177
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:37,458
And then.

178
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:41,000
The U.S. military
found your mother.

179
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:43,291
Shortly after they had
taken her away from here,

180
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:45,291
the Burst died down.

181
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:48,125
Rumors began circulating.

182
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,541
People said it was the woman

183
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:52,708
who fell from the sky who
angered the Sea Colossus.

184
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:57,000
That she had called the
Scub and caused the Burst.

185
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:59,250
But that's ridiculous!

186
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:01,500
It's got nothing to do with us!

187
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:03,541
It was tragic.

188
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:06,125
The Scub Burst
claimed many lives.

189
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:09,125
A group of our people
was on the main island.

190
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:11,333
The only one who
survived was your friend.

191
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:13,458
Arata's daughter, Naru.

192
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:19,291
And for that you blamed me.

193
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:21,291
What was I supposed to do?

194
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,333
I was three years old!

195
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:28,125
There is nothing
you could have done

196
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:33,041
but we cannot forgive you or
your mother for what happened.

197
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,666
I'm sorry, Ao.

198
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:40,791
Damn it!

199
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:42,625
It was after the
Scub Coral popped up

200
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:45,041
that the Trapar Bubble
started, right?

201
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:47,500
A lot of good stuff's
happened since then.

202
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:49,875
Only the main island
benefitted, though,

203
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:54,041
and we lost our fishing rights
in the negotiations with China.

204
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:56,750
Iwato was falling
apart back then.

205
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:58,875
No, the island was changing

206
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:01,791
and our fathers just
needed somebody to blame.

207
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:03,625
So that's what they did.

208
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:07,458
Come on, let's get moving.

209
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:12,208
Generation Bleu?

210
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,333
What do you want with the boy?

211
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:16,250
I knew this woman once.

212
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:19,208
Her hair was
bright turquoise blue.

213
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:20,791
That child's mother.

214
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:23,875
I want to know
what color hair she had.

215
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:29,625
Hey, get out of there!

216
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:30,875
Come on!

217
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:34,250
How were you able
to operate the Nirvash?

218
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:35,625
Tell me, boy!

219
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:36,416
Nirvash?

220
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,250
What's that?

221
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:41,333
It's what a certain
woman called the IFO.

222
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:43,083
The Nirvash.

223
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:51,666
I think we overdid it!

224
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,625
Hurry!

225
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:54,750
In you go.

226
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,875
What's taking you so long?

227
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:57,625
Hurry up!

228
00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:59,125
Jiro!

229
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:01,708
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

230
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,250
Who's Jiro?

231
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:06,500
That's Gazelle's real name.

232
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:09,000
So then that's, his father?

233
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:10,708
I don't know any Jiro.

234
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:11,833
I'm Gazelle!

235
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:13,833
That's my true name, old man!

236
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:15,833
Gazelle, my ass,
you ungrateful boy!

237
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:17,166
Get out of there, Reo!

238
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,041
You idiot!

239
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:19,875
I don't know what we're doing!

240
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:21,166
The boy stays with us!

241
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:22,500
Him, too?

242
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:24,916
We're gonna use him
to make a deal with the JAF.

243
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,333
To win Okinawa
true independence!

244
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:28,375
No!

245
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:31,083
Get off of me!

246
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:33,708
Jiro!

247
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:34,750
When we were younger,

248
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:36,291
we were always
picking on this kid,

249
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,583
never letting him
forget he was an outsider.

250
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:40,666
And do you know why?

251
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:44,041
Because of you!

252
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:45,833
The adults, all of you!

253
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:48,041
You told us that he
and his mom were aliens.

254
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:50,916
And that they were
to blame for everything!

255
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:53,708
For how we lost
our fishing rights

256
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:55,750
and this stupid
pseudo-independence!

257
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:57,666
We blamed it all on Ao!

258
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:02,250
But you turned down the
Scub Burst compensation money!

259
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:05,041
You kids never got it!

260
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:05,916
Listen!

261
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,333
I thought we won independence!

262
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:10,250
From Japan, and from America!

263
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:11,833
And from China!

264
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:13,375
So why don't you act like it?

265
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:16,250
Don't just sit there,
do something!

266
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:25,500
That's how it is, then.

267
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:26,666
Just watch.

268
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,958
We will take action!

269
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:30,916
We will do something!

270
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:48,583
Hey, what the hell is that?

271
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:52,000
Is that a G-Monster?

272
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:53,958
That thing is seriously big.

273
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:56,083
Papa and the others
will get out, won't they?

274
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:58,208
Damn them and
this entire island!

275
00:15:58,291 --> 00:15:59,541
Like I give a damn.

276
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,833
You wanted to protect
the island yesterday!

277
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:03,250
Shut up, kid!

278
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:04,250
We're friends, aren't we?

279
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:06,791
Gah... Don't give me crap!

280
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:07,833
Now we're friends?

281
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:09,500
Let's get your
IFO up and running.

282
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:12,000
We're going to take
the fight to our enemies.

283
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:12,916
No, I won't.

284
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
What? Why?

285
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:15,583
I don't want to pilot it.

286
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:16,750
See what it gave me?

287
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:18,041
Blue hair!

288
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:21,416
Drop me off at Gramps' place!

289
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:31,458
No way.

290
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:36,750
He's here!

291
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:38,708
Hey! Gramps!

292
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:46,000
You're back, Ao?

293
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,333
You mustn't blame them.

294
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:50,708
It won't help.

295
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:53,458
But they set the house on fire!

296
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:55,458
Even so.

297
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:57,708
Those men were all
born on this island,

298
00:16:57,791 --> 00:16:59,708
and this is where they'll die.

299
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:02,750
They don't know how
to live anywhere else.

300
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:05,083
They love this land so much.

301
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:07,750
And all they want
is to protect it.

302
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:10,833
Try to see that.

303
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:12,791
He said, "I'm sorry."

304
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:16,791
Is that what Gazelle's
old man was trying to tell me?

305
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:19,250
Is that what he was saying?

306
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:26,500
Get away from here.

307
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:27,791
Head for the ocean!

308
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:32,000
Hey! Wait! Ao! Ao!

309
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:36,666
I do see.

310
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,000
I do.

311
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:40,666
Because I used to
love this island, too!

312
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,250
Do you see how huge it is?

313
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:06,333
I don't care where.

314
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:07,750
Hit the damn thing!

315
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:08,833
Uh, Captain!

316
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:09,625
What is it?

317
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:11,083
It's Generation Bleu.

318
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:13,375
They're offering advice.

319
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:15,250
Are they?

320
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:17,333
My apologies for earlier.

321
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:18,291
It's fine.

322
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:19,500
We're preparing to launch

323
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:22,291
a full-scale attack
against the G-Monster.

324
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:24,458
I really wouldn't
do that if I were you.

325
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:25,875
And why not?

326
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:28,541
Secrets emit powerful
electromagnetic pulses

327
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:32,041
that destroy
electronic equipment.

328
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:33,708
Furthermore, they
respond to attacks

329
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:37,708
by conventional warheads
like yours by returning fire.

330
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:39,458
We've been publicizing
this information

331
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:41,833
for over ten years now,
but for some reason,

332
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:44,541
people still don't
seem to understand it.

333
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:46,416
What do you expect us to do?

334
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:50,208
FPs and IFOs are the only
things Secrets are slow to see

335
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:53,875
and since the only two IFOs
in the area belong to us.

336
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:55,833
There're three.

337
00:18:58,208 --> 00:19:00,041
Headquarters is
trying to renegotiate

338
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:02,083
our contract with Okinawa.

339
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:05,125
But we know the earlier
Burst is still in effect.

340
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:06,916
Team Pied Piper is here.

341
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,750
They stand ready
to eliminate the Secret.

342
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:12,500
Thank you all.

343
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:14,750
You're very welcome.

344
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:16,708
ZOA mapping complete.

345
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:22,541
Keep yourself out of the ZOA.

346
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:23,375
You got that?

347
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:24,833
Yeah.

348
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:26,083
Well, Kyrie.

349
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:27,458
We're off!

350
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:36,833
O-N boys at full power!

351
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:38,458
Let's go!

352
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:46,333
We're all set.

353
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:47,750
It can't see us now.

354
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:49,333
We're right next to the Scub.

355
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:51,041
Round two!

356
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:57,833
Oh, yeah?

357
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:08,625
Sorry!

358
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,000
I let two through.

359
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:10,875
No worries.

360
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:12,000
I'll get rid of them.

361
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:14,125
You take evasive action.

362
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:22,791
Close one. You okay?

363
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:24,250
No way. This is nothing.

364
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:26,833
Uh, was that a "yes" or "no"?

365
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:29,541
Here they come.

366
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:30,541
Of course.

367
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:33,875
Everyone wants
to join the party!

368
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:38,708
You said you wouldn't fly it.

369
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:40,333
So what the heck are you doing?

370
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:42,250
Fighting the G-Monster.

371
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:43,291
It's huge!

372
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:44,375
If the last one
was a fighter plane,

373
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:46,666
this is an aircraft carrier.

374
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,541
You're protecting them?

375
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:51,833
The same men who hunted
you down and locked you up?

376
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:54,083
I don't want to fly it.

377
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:56,958
I'll be an alien for real

378
00:20:57,708 --> 00:21:01,458
but if I do nothing,
I know I'll regret it.

379
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:03,875
Just like your old man.

380
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:05,750
Like my dad?

381
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:09,000
I just, I don't want to
have to look at some kid

382
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:11,500
and say, I'm "sorry."

383
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:21,708
Mama?

384
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:27,250
Stay still for a moment.

385
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:29,083
We need to do this.

386
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:31,500
So Nirvash will remember you.

387
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:34,166
What's a Nirvash?

388
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:47,041
I see.

389
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:49,541
You remember me.

390
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:53,916
It's been, so long.

391
00:22:36,666 --> 00:22:37,916
To be continued!

392
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:15,375
Next time, on Eureka Seven AO.

393
00:24:15,458 --> 00:24:18,958
Ao once more throws himself into
battle to protect the island.

394
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:21,291
And the fierceness of
his spirit finally begins

395
00:24:21,375 --> 00:24:23,000
to touch others' hearts.

396
00:24:23,083 --> 00:24:24,500
But what will the young boy do

397
00:24:24,583 --> 00:24:28,458
when he realizes he no longer
has a place to call home?

398
00:24:28,541 --> 00:24:32,750
Eureka Seven AO, Episode 4:
"plant coral."

399
00:24:32,833 --> 00:24:35,333
Hear the cry of the
children of the stars.
