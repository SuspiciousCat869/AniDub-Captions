1
00:01:52,541 --> 00:01:53,750
Earth?

2
00:01:53,833 --> 00:01:55,458
Is that Earth?

3
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:11,500
Wow!

4
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:12,750
I see now.

5
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:14,791
So this is what your purpose is.

6
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,375
Oh, no.

7
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:27,458
I can feel them all dying.

8
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:40,625
Amazing!

9
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:43,208
This is so incredible!

10
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:51,166
I understand!

11
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:52,791
I understand it all!

12
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:54,583
Ao!

13
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:10,583
Where am I?

14
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:16,625
Impossible!

15
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:19,791
Naru, is that you?

16
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:26,708
Is it true that
Colonel Endo was killed?

17
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:27,958
It certainly seems that way.

18
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:33,541
So they attacked a
JAF officer with an IFO?

19
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:36,708
And in Japan's
territorial waters, no less.

20
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:39,708
How should we respond
to this, Captain?

21
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:41,083
After what they've done,

22
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:43,958
are we still permitted only
to sit back and observe?

23
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:47,291
I'll ask Base Command to
reconsider their decision.

24
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:49,041
But, before I do so.

25
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:49,791
All ships!

26
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:51,625
Prepare to attack!

27
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:53,833
But our opponent
is Generation Bleu!

28
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:56,083
I don't care who it is, officer.

29
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:58,500
Wrong is wrong!

30
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:06,833
Georg!

31
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:09,291
Has a Scub Coral been sighted?

32
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:12,875
Negative, nothing
has appeared thus far.

33
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:22,708
A Secret?

34
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,125
Good, I got through to you!

35
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:25,958
Listen, Eureka.

36
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:27,000
What is it Ao?

37
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:29,166
Do you see that
big pillar of light?

38
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,833
The Secrets and the Scub
Coral both come from there.

39
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:33,083
If you fly into it

40
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:35,375
I can go home.

41
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:41,291
You won't get away!

42
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:56,833
Eureka!

43
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:07,916
He looks like a
normal human being, but...

44
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,916
Truth.

45
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,625
What in the world
are you, really?

46
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:11,375
Elena!

47
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:12,666
Fire on him!

48
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,541
Now!

49
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:17,500
Eureka. Eureka!

50
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,541
I won't let you leave again!

51
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:20,666
Elena!

52
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:31,166
Elena, are you okay?

53
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,708
Hey thanks for
the save you guys!

54
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:35,791
I don't want your thanks!

55
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,125
Hurry, Eureka!

56
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:38,916
Hurry?

57
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,666
Where's she going?

58
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:41,541
Back home.

59
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:42,583
What?

60
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:44,541
Yeah, I'm sending her home.

61
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:45,625
What do you mean!

62
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:46,500
How?

63
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:48,291
Using the pillar of light.

64
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:49,750
What's he thinking?

65
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:52,041
But you only just got her back!

66
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:56,333
President Blanc, Truth,
the Allied Forces, the JAF.

67
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:59,083
Everybody wants a piece of her!

68
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:01,083
Gazelle, shouldn't we stop him?

69
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:06,166
This situation's gotta be
hard enough on him as it is.

70
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:07,500
Leave him be.

71
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:09,583
He is being pretty mature
about the whole thing.

72
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:12,458
If I was reunited with
my mom after all that time,

73
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:15,291
I'd hug her and never let
her out of my sight again.

74
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:20,083
There!

75
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:21,041
This is it!

76
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:22,625
If you fly in there--

77
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:31,208
I don't understand!

78
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:33,416
Why is everybody after us?

79
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:41,166
What's happening?

80
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:41,958
Nirvash!

81
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:42,875
What's wrong?

82
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:44,083
What is it?

83
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:49,000
You ejected me?

84
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:52,583
Why, Nirvash?

85
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:55,333
Where are you going?

86
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:57,250
Eureka!

87
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:58,916
Ao!

88
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,541
Eureka!

89
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:13,916
That was close!

90
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,708
But why did you eject?

91
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:15,333
I didn't.

92
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:16,125
It wasn't me.

93
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:17,666
It was, Nirvash!

94
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:18,958
Nirvash?

95
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:21,291
But an IFO can't act
all on its own like that!

96
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:22,208
Yes, it can.

97
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:25,500
Inside, Nirvash is the same as--

98
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:27,625
The same as, me.

99
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:41,583
There are two Mark I's.

100
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:44,541
Which means two Third Engines.

101
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,166
Is it possible?

102
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:55,208
Why fight me?

103
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:57,333
What do you have
inside of you, Nirvash?

104
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:59,208
What is it that
makes you hate me?

105
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:15,375
Nirvash.

106
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:16,583
Let's get going.

107
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:18,166
We need to reach the pillar.

108
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:21,250
Wait a second!

109
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:22,666
A Secret?

110
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,000
No way!

111
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:26,708
A Scub Coral appears,
and then the Secret comes.

112
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:28,583
That's how it always happens.

113
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:29,750
This is backwards!

114
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:31,750
Do you know what's
going on, Elena?

115
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:33,208
Are you leaving again?

116
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:34,458
What?

117
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:36,875
Eureka.

118
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:41,125
He was right, after all!

119
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:43,291
Johansson's theory was correct!

120
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:46,166
Secrets don't appear in pursuit
of Scub Corals exclusively,

121
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,500
as we thought they did.

122
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:49,916
Their true objective
is much broader!

123
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:04,958
Damn!

124
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:07,625
Without a weapon, I can't
get anywhere near the light!

125
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:08,958
Wait I know!

126
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:12,041
Let me try something.

127
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:18,916
Whoa!

128
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,291
That was an extra lock that

129
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:22,583
even our chief engineer
Alex couldn't break through!

130
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:23,541
Hurry, Ao!

131
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:25,166
Shoot at it!

132
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,416
Right!

133
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:37,250
Now's your chance!

134
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:41,875
Go!

135
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:43,541
Tell me something.

136
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:44,666
What is it?

137
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,041
You called me Mama...

138
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:48,333
Is it because I'm
about to have a baby?

139
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:53,666
Oh, well, I, I just.

140
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,458
I wish you a healthy son!

141
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:57,833
He's lucky!

142
00:09:57,916 --> 00:10:00,583
Thanks, but this
child's actually a girl.

143
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:01,750
What?

144
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:03,625
That's what the
doctor said: a baby girl!

145
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:05,000
Hold on a sec!

146
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:07,041
Thanks for everything, Ao!

147
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:09,000
Eureka!

148
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:12,083
Are you completely
sure it's a--?

149
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:24,583
What the?

150
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,833
Is that, Nirvash?

151
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:47,250
We had no choice.

152
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:49,791
We were forced to return fire.

153
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:51,583
The JAF were the aggressors.

154
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:53,166
They struck first.

155
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:56,458
But we were in Japan's
territorial waters.

156
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:57,916
Hey, Ivica.

157
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,750
That JAF soldier,
Endo, did you know him?

158
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:11,666
That's it!

159
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:12,541
Slowly, now.

160
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:13,708
Be careful.

161
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,041
We don't want to lose it.

162
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:17,500
Sir do you seriously want
to salvage the Secret?

163
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:19,458
I promise, there is no danger.

164
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:20,541
Do you know why?

165
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:21,916
When a Secret
appears in our world,

166
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,125
it is responding
to a specific target.

167
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:25,375
And in this case,

168
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:27,750
my friend, that target
is no longer accessible.

169
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:30,416
This Secret wasn't
after a Scub Coral.

170
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:34,000
It came here because it wanted
to destroy the two Mark I's.

171
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:52,541
Well, good morning!

172
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:54,666
Are you hungry?

173
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:57,458
Only if you promise
not to serve bar food.

174
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:03,958
You come home just
to ransack the house?

175
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:06,166
I'm looking for something.

176
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,250
Do you think it's possible

177
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:09,708
that my father
didn't abandon my mom?

178
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:12,041
Whoever said he did
in the first place?

179
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:15,458
It's just, well, she had me
all by herself, didn't she?

180
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:18,833
So why wasn't he in the picture?

181
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:22,500
Things aren't always
that black and white.

182
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:25,291
Eureka told me.

183
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:28,458
He's not here,
because he's fighting.

184
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:31,541
He's fighting for us.

185
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:34,833
For me and, for our child.

186
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:38,250
I have to fight, too!

187
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:44,708
Why didn't you
ever tell me that?

188
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:47,458
Because it wasn't something
you were ready to hear.

189
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:48,875
You said you didn't
want to know anything

190
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:52,333
about the bastard who'd
abandoned your mom, remember?

191
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:54,708
Yeah, that's true, but still.

192
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:58,583
I don't see why.

193
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:02,250
You didn't tell me
about my sister.

194
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:04,041
Tell you about what?

195
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:06,875
Don't you know?

196
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:08,916
I've got a big sister.

197
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,458
You've met Eureka somehow.

198
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,583
Why does that piss you off?

199
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:15,000
Let's go.

200
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:19,916
Naru?

201
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,791
I don't understand.

202
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:21,833
She just appeared?

203
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:23,125
Out of nowhere?

204
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:24,541
I assumed that you'd come back

205
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:26,791
to the island because
you heard the news.

206
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:31,000
Uh, well, no.

207
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:36,375
I wouldn't tell her that.

208
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,791
So, you came back
here to see me?

209
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:04,083
I had business on the island,

210
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:06,250
and I just thought I'd stop by.

211
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:17,333
I had a dream about you.

212
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:18,708
It was weird.

213
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:21,625
You had to choose between
me and this crazy guy.

214
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:24,541
You chose the
crazy guy and left.

215
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:26,708
He isn't crazy.

216
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:29,291
Truth, I mean.

217
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,333
Hold on!

218
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:31,791
But that was just a dream.

219
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:33,250
Wasn't it?

220
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:35,291
Truth explained it to me.

221
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,500
Your consciousness
was actually over here.

222
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:38,708
That happened?

223
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:41,083
You really ran off with Truth?

224
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:44,333
I had a dream of
my own, you see.

225
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:46,166
It was about the Coralians.

226
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,833
The, the Coralians?

227
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:52,041
The dream showed me the
incredibly distant future.

228
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:54,416
The Coralians came
here to the Earth.

229
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,375
They fused with
the ocean corals,

230
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:58,125
which were on
the verge of dying.

231
00:14:58,208 --> 00:15:00,833
They hoped to
communicate with Earth.

232
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:03,916
Trapars are a byproduct
of their metabolic process.

233
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:06,500
In time, the humans

234
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:09,583
who had initially fled
the Earth came back.

235
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:11,500
In order to
communicate with people,

236
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:15,416
the Coralians created something
very similar to a human.

237
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,291
It was her.

238
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:20,708
What kind of dream is that?

239
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:24,041
Futuristic coral-people really?

240
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:25,583
The future.

241
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:27,375
What I'm trying to say
is that they stumbled

242
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:30,291
across a way to
travel back to our time.

243
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:32,875
And they're seeking to
communicate with us.

244
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:34,500
That's what Ivica said.

245
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:37,125
Eureka came from the future.

246
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:40,625
Mutant coral monsters.

247
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:43,125
And I'm the son of one of them?

248
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:45,291
I never said they were monsters.

249
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:47,041
You see, the Scub Coral intend

250
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:49,916
to spread themselves
throughout our entire world.

251
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,375
If their Quartz is
taken away, though--

252
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:53,333
Interesting conversation.

253
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:56,375
Sounds like the Scub Corals
are very dangerous.

254
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:57,875
Who is this man?

255
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:58,875
Doctor?

256
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,375
It just so happens;

257
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:02,750
this fine gentleman is against
the independence movement.

258
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:05,625
He's been cooperating
with us for some time now.

259
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:08,000
You're JAF, aren't you?

260
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:09,375
Yes I am,

261
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:11,166
and I would advise you
to show a bit more respect.

262
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:12,750
Okinawa and its
surrounding islands

263
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:15,833
have always been the rightful
territories of my country.

264
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:18,291
You owe allegiance
to Japan and no other.

265
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:20,208
Now, if you'll
take a look at this.

266
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:22,416
An x-ray of Naru Arata.

267
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,500
This shows that
your lungs, your heart,

268
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,000
and your spine are all infested

269
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:29,458
with the very same substance
that makes up Scub Corals.

270
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:34,083
Scubs are pathogenic entities
that parasitize on human beings.

271
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:36,250
It is imperative that
we prevent this contagion

272
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:37,791
from spreading further.

273
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:40,666
We will quarantine you
and destroy the plant.

274
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:46,458
The Allied Forces have
troops stationed on Iwato.

275
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:49,500
Why would they let
the JAF land there?

276
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:51,041
I may have an answer for that.

277
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:53,958
The Japanese government sent
this out to all the embassies.

278
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,458
With this
groundbreaking discovery,

279
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:58,416
we have at last
succeeded in communicating

280
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,875
with the G-Monsters,

281
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:03,166
the entities also
sometimes known as Secrets.

282
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:07,291
And so we have learned that they
harbor no malice for humans.

283
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:08,541
Invaders from other dimensions

284
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:10,291
are encroaching
upon our universe.

285
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:12,375
Secrets occur in
response to the appearance

286
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:15,083
of such invaders
Scub Corals among them.

287
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:17,625
In this way, they are
like white blood cells.

288
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:19,625
Scub Corals contain
elementary particles

289
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:22,708
that are completely
unknown to this universe.

290
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,666
In contrast, the
Secrets are composed

291
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:25,666
entirely of known substances.

292
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,375
So the Scub Corals
are the invaders

293
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:29,958
and the Secrets
are mankind's allies?

294
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:32,958
As you can imagine,
everybody is skeptical.

295
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:35,875
But a claim like this
requires further investigation.

296
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:37,666
While everyone was
reeling from the news,

297
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:41,083
the JAF took the opportunity
to land on Iwato Island,

298
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:43,125
which remains
disputed territory.

299
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:45,791
But Ao is a Generation
Bleu employee now.

300
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:47,166
The way they're telling it,

301
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,583
Ao violated their
territorial waters.

302
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:53,375
They say that he killed
one of their soldiers.

303
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:08,208
They're taking Nirvash!

304
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:11,541
Hey, hold on!

305
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:13,875
I got permission to
land from the SDF, right?

306
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:15,125
So why?

307
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:17,583
We're handing it over
as a piece of evidence.

308
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:18,458
I'm sorry.

309
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:19,625
I don't care if you're sorry!

310
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:20,708
Tell me why!

311
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:22,083
The Allied Forces.

312
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:25,583
Or, rather, the US
government sent us a notice.

313
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:26,875
They say the protection afforded

314
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:29,666
by our laws doesn't
extend to include you.

315
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,708
Why doesn't it include me?

316
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:33,333
The reason seems pretty obvious:

317
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:34,916
you aren't a human child.

318
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,708
You even acknowledged
it yourself.

319
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:39,041
Quarantining a patient tainted

320
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:41,958
by the Scub is only one
of the reasons we're here.

321
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:43,250
We also came to
secure the criminal

322
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:45,291
who violated our
territorial waters

323
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,916
and knowingly killed
one of our men.

324
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,375
That's you, by the way.

325
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:51,083
In case you hadn't
figured that part out yet.

326
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:54,666
And, naturally, we notified
the US of our intentions here.

327
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,291
If the Allied Forces intervene,

328
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:59,583
this could very easily escalate
into a territorial issue.

329
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:01,833
Essentially, they can't
afford to get into another war

330
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:03,833
over something as
trivial as this.

331
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:06,208
You and I aren't worth
that kind of trouble.

332
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:08,416
But there's got to be
more to it than that.

333
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,208
What else is going on here?

334
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:12,916
The Japanese
government announced

335
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,416
that the Scub Corals are
actually hostile invaders

336
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,666
from another dimension.

337
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,958
I'm telling you,
they're not the enemy!

338
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:21,458
You still say that after
what they've done to you?

339
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:22,166
Yes!

340
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,041
Don't you understand?

341
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:24,708
They're doing this to help me!

342
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:27,291
They want to communicate,
to be friends with me.

343
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:28,500
Yes, and I've heard

344
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:31,250
that parasites make
such wonderful friends.

345
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:33,625
Come with me Ao.

346
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:47,916
Naru?

347
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,708
One of the Scub Corals!

348
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:50,041
It's not!

349
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:51,625
That's just a coral reef.

350
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:56,500
That's no normal coral!

351
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:57,625
Naru!

352
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:01,583
Come on, men!

353
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:03,333
Why are you just standing there?

354
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:04,375
What the hell are you doing?

355
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:06,541
You can't turn
your gun on a child!

356
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:08,500
Think about what you're doing!

357
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:11,583
Let me go!

358
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:12,750
Hey!

359
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,458
Naru, I've brought you a gift.

360
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:25,375
You have excellent
timing you know that?

361
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:27,708
We've only been
apart a short time.

362
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:30,250
But you seem to have
become awfully perceptive.

363
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:31,291
You're correct.

364
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:33,666
In fact, I know
about you now, too.

365
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:51,000
It's just like in my dream.

366
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:54,083
Naru.

367
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:55,791
Eureka.

368
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:57,083
Go to him!

369
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:59,250
Ao needs your help now!

370
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:00,958
If he doesn't
destroy the Scub Corals,

371
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:03,083
then something
terrible will happen.

372
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:04,625
Leave, Eureka!

373
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:06,083
You're in my way!

374
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:08,000
And you can't
tell me what to do!

375
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,666
That Mark I!

376
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:28,416
Is it the same one
from the other day?

377
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,250
Is it Eureka?

378
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:35,041
No, it can't be.

379
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:39,416
Ao!

380
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,833
Please, come with me.

381
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:42,875
Naru!

382
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:44,083
What are you doing?

383
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:46,166
That doesn't belong to you!

384
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:48,958
See? I can operate
IFOs, just like you!

385
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:50,625
You don't need to do this, Naru!

386
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:51,791
Come on.

387
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:53,541
I'll protect you!

388
00:21:57,375 --> 00:21:58,916
No, Ao.

389
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,291
What I wanted was
to fly beside you,

390
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:04,041
not to have you treat me
like some helpless child.

391
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:05,625
Truth's here!

392
00:22:29,041 --> 00:22:30,083
I don't understand.

393
00:22:30,166 --> 00:22:32,958
Why would you do this?

394
00:22:33,041 --> 00:22:34,583
Why?

395
00:24:12,958 --> 00:24:16,083
Next time on Eureka Seven AO.

396
00:24:16,166 --> 00:24:19,125
Ao remains bewildered by
his mother's parting words.

397
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:21,833
But there is no time
to unravel their meaning.

398
00:24:21,916 --> 00:24:23,041
Ao and his friends are plunged

399
00:24:23,125 --> 00:24:25,500
into a desperate
and disastrous battle.

400
00:24:25,583 --> 00:24:28,458
And the adults are forced
to make a cruel decision.

401
00:24:28,541 --> 00:24:33,416
Eureka Seven AO, Episode 15:
"humanoid secret."

402
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:36,208
Hear the cry of the
children of the stars.
