1
00:01:53,708 --> 00:01:54,625
Of course.

2
00:01:54,708 --> 00:01:57,208
Everybody around
here knows Miller.

3
00:01:57,291 --> 00:01:58,458
And this is the place

4
00:01:58,541 --> 00:02:00,291
where she was singing
when she got recruited?

5
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:02,166
By Generation Bleu, wasn't it?

6
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,583
Who else could he be
talking about, Gazelle?

7
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:05,625
It's got to be her.

8
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:07,083
You heard about that?

9
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:09,583
Yeah, mate, it's not
like this is Las Vegas.

10
00:02:09,666 --> 00:02:11,166
Did find it a bit
odd for a business

11
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,666
to scoop up a musician
like that, though.

12
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,250
It is Gen Bleu.

13
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:18,291
That big of a company has its
fingers in all kinds of pies.

14
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:19,458
Right.

15
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:21,500
And her contract was
only for six months.

16
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:24,541
What is it you blokes
are trying to find out?

17
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:27,708
The truth about the
woman known as Miller!

18
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:28,875
Hey, man.

19
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:30,500
Is this a photo of her?

20
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:32,000
Yeah.

21
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:39,500
So Miller definitely
was a real singer.

22
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:41,875
I still say this is impossible.

23
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:45,541
Either of you guys ever
seen Miller perform?

24
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:49,750
She's all sexy and passionate
when she's up on stage.

25
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:52,208
A true artist, you
know what I mean?

26
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:55,500
Compared to her, this other
chick's just a fan girl.

27
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:01,291
We have to go to America.

28
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:02,666
Again, why?

29
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:05,625
To visit the hometown of
Elena Peoples, right?

30
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:19,041
Kyrie! Kyrie!

31
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:20,458
Do you copy?

32
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:21,583
Elena?

33
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:23,791
Who's Elena?

34
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:25,583
Oh, sorry, are you
talking to me?

35
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:28,333
Is this another dumb manga game?

36
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,500
I don't think so, Ao?

37
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:37,791
There's still no sign
of a Secret around here.

38
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:40,375
There can be no
doubt that a Scub Burst

39
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:42,250
has recently occurred.

40
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:43,708
The appearance of Scub Corals

41
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:46,125
and Secrets is accompanied
by pillars of light.

42
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:50,041
And such pillars have indeed
been sighted on this occasion.

43
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:51,208
We can be certain

44
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:53,875
that the Secret is
closing in on the Scub.

45
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:57,083
That's something I've
been wondering about.

46
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:59,625
What are those weird lights?

47
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:01,958
Well, uh, That's difficult to--

48
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:03,375
Does anybody know
where Scub Corals

49
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:05,625
and Secrets come from?

50
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:06,958
Various theories
have been put forth

51
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:09,708
regarding the origins
of these phenomena.

52
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:13,166
The scientific community has
not yet reached a consensus.

53
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,958
Some believe that
the Trapars undergo

54
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:17,583
a kind of chemical change
and amass together.

55
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:19,916
This is the spontaneous
occurrence theory.

56
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,666
Others suggest that
there is another place,

57
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,875
different from our w--!

58
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:25,458
My nose!

59
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:27,541
We don't really have time for
an in-depth scientific lecture.

60
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:29,041
Okay, Ao?

61
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:30,916
Yes, ma'am.

62
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,041
The dust filters
can't take any more.

63
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:34,375
Head back for now an--

64
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:35,791
Oh.

65
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:38,791
I'm clear.

66
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:44,875
I have a visual on the
Scub Coral, but still no Secret.

67
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:51,208
What the hell is that thing?

68
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,583
Nothing in our data.

69
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:54,708
Maybe it's Truth pulling
another stunt or something.

70
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:57,083
Truth again?

71
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:05,875
That bastard!

72
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:13,333
Hold on!

73
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:15,708
You can't blindly
charge into the ZOA!

74
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:17,583
Currently, there is
no evidence of a Secret

75
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:20,125
or the life signs that would
indicate Truth's presence.

76
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:21,541
Are you sure, Georg?

77
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:23,125
Are you malfunctioning?

78
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:25,541
I didn't think I hit you hard
enough to cause any real damage!

79
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:28,041
Aww, you broke him!

80
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:30,916
No!

81
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,375
Are you seeing things, Ao?

82
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:52,583
There's no sign of Truth here.

83
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:54,333
He disappeared.

84
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:56,500
I saw him!
I know I did!

85
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:57,833
Right in front of me!

86
00:05:57,916 --> 00:05:59,375
You know thinking about
your little girlfriend

87
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:01,333
is clouding your judgment.

88
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:02,833
Did someone wake up
on the wrong side

89
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:04,541
of the bed this morning?

90
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:05,875
Rumor has it

91
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:07,708
she got into another
fight with President Dad.

92
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:09,833
Don't call him that,
It's ridiculous!

93
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:13,125
Was there a fight, sir?

94
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:14,916
I don't understand what
all the fuss is about.

95
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,916
I just asked her how things
were going with Ao lately.

96
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:20,625
That stupid old man!

97
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:22,083
Could he be more wrong?

98
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:24,291
Like there'd ever be
anything between us!

99
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:25,500
You're younger than me!

100
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:27,958
And you're already
in love, anyway.

101
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:29,250
We're just friends!

102
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:31,083
Plus, she's got a
crush on someone else.

103
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:32,333
Don't you, Fleur?

104
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:40,791
I hate you! I hate you!
I hate you!

105
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:46,875
You won't get away!

106
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:48,041
Not this time!

107
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:52,125
What's that?

108
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,291
Aww, jeez.

109
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:02,041
Good likeness.

110
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:04,541
Damn smug face!

111
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:05,791
Stupid old man!
Stupid old man!

112
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:07,416
Stupid old man!

113
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:18,208
It's Dad all marked up!

114
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:22,250
We can't say for certain

115
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:24,458
if we've completely
driven off the Secret.

116
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:26,583
There should be no
need for further action.

117
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:28,125
Just as long as you've
collected the Quartz

118
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:30,583
and stabilized the situation.

119
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:32,875
I'll advise the Australian
government to stay on alert,

120
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:34,958
just in case.

121
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:37,916
Uh, if it helps any,

122
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,708
it didn't look all that
much like you, sir.

123
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:58,166
Hello?

124
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,500
Hey, Mr. Blanc!

125
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:01,000
You listening?

126
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:02,291
Of course I am.

127
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:05,125
Tell me, how's the
investigation coming along?

128
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:07,125
The facility's been shut down.

129
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:09,208
Yes, I expected as much.

130
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:10,750
It makes sense;

131
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:12,666
I was told there weren't very
many children left anymore

132
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,750
by the time we took Elena in.

133
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,666
What kind of place
is this, anyway?

134
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,500
There's no data on it.

135
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:20,666
As you may know,

136
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,541
there are certain
children who are born

137
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:25,458
with the innate
ability to pilot IFOs.

138
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:27,166
Ao was like that.

139
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,416
It's not entirely clear,

140
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,458
but some believe that
being born in a region

141
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:33,125
with high Trapar
concentration causes changes

142
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:34,916
to occur in the brain.

143
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,541
Certain countries
conducted research

144
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:38,750
on the subject
by using children.

145
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:41,083
That's what they did there.

146
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,250
You mean Elena was
raised at this facility?

147
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:45,875
Are you still working
under the assumption

148
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:48,000
that she and Miller
are the same person?

149
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:49,208
You saw the footage

150
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:51,291
from the surveillance
cameras, didn't you?

151
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:52,708
They appeared to show Miller,

152
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:55,291
the musician contracted
to our company.

153
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:58,625
Yes, I'm aware of her
suspicious behavior.

154
00:08:58,708 --> 00:09:00,333
I've taken a look at her logs.

155
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:03,041
Based on those, she's most
likely an intelligence asset

156
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,041
sent in by the United States.

157
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:06,666
But the idea that she
and Elena Peoples

158
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:09,416
are one and the same is
nothing more than conjecture.

159
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,875
Your own personal hypothesis.

160
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:13,041
Elena has been in training

161
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:15,833
with Generation Bleu
for over two years.

162
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:19,875
That's it, then.

163
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:21,833
So much for your grand theory.

164
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:24,458
She was in IFO pilot
training at the company.

165
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:27,125
So how could she be playing
music in Manchester?

166
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:30,291
What's the deal?

167
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:32,000
You look pissed off, man.

168
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:34,666
I'm thinking about
what Truth said to me.

169
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:39,500
You demand the truth of me,
but you can't even see it.

170
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
The truth reveals
itself only to those

171
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,416
who are courageous
enough to embrace it.

172
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:47,791
He called me out.

173
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:49,458
He said there's something
wrong with the world,

174
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:52,500
and I'm not brave enough
to see the truth of it.

175
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:53,750
Yeah, sure, we remember.

176
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:55,416
So what about it?

177
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,333
I don't know.

178
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:57,583
Come on, man.

179
00:09:57,666 --> 00:10:00,875
Whatever it is though,
I don't like it!

180
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:15,791
This is twenty stories
beneath headquarters.

181
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:17,916
The emergency stairs
seem to end here.

182
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,666
But I believe that
there are levels

183
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,208
even further down than this.

184
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:22,375
This doesn't look
like it was built

185
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:24,583
by any civilization on Earth.

186
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,041
I know it may sound crazy,

187
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,500
but it's like it's from
a different world.

188
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:33,708
You're telling me
that this isn't Miller?

189
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:34,916
Correct, sir.

190
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,500
Miller was a covert
operative that

191
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:39,500
we had selected together
with British intelligence.

192
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:40,875
She was carefully prepared
so that she'd be able

193
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:43,750
to contract out with
Generation Bleu.

194
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:45,333
Yes, I remember.

195
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:48,875
Some funds from IFO procurement
were put toward that project.

196
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:53,166
Naturally, we collected data on
all identifying characteristics.

197
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,750
This woman looks very similar,

198
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:57,375
but her voiceprint shows
a subtle discrepancy.

199
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:59,083
Also, we have this from an asset

200
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:01,791
who's serving as her
producer I had him collect

201
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:05,458
a saliva sample and
we tested the DNA.

202
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:08,000
She's a completely
different person!

203
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:10,083
For the past two months
at the very least.

204
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:11,750
The person we have
been in contact with

205
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:13,333
has not been Miller.

206
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:15,625
Okay, then who the hell is she?

207
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,541
That's impossible!

208
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,083
Sure enough, we're going
to have to strip down

209
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:47,333
all the armor to
get it clean again.

210
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:48,625
Damn sand!

211
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:52,041
No fun!

212
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:54,333
How long is Stanley going to be
acting as our chief, anyway?

213
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:55,958
Whining won't help anything.

214
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:58,875
Did you notice he was marking
down changes in our weight?

215
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:01,500
That's got to make you
feel self-conscious, Sis.

216
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:02,875
What?

217
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:04,375
So I've put on a little weight,
what's the big deal?

218
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:06,250
It doesn't matter who it is.

219
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:10,625
No one can replace Bruno.

220
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:14,166
No of course not.

221
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,625
What I wouldn't give
for one last hug

222
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:17,708
from that big old teddy bear.

223
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:28,458
Chief!

224
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:31,083
Is Goldilocks being scrambled?

225
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:32,333
What are you talking about?

226
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:33,583
Sir look!

227
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:38,375
Stop them!

228
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:48,625
Bruno!

229
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:15,875
My name is, Miller.

230
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:19,500
My name is, Elena.

231
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,708
My name is...

232
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:56,500
It's Miller.

233
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:58,250
Elena.

234
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:09,458
Today was just a fake-out.

235
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:12,416
But I am going to
find Truth, then, I'll--!

236
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:17,583
Uh, what's up?

237
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:19,416
It's like I told you!

238
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,625
We're going together!

239
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:25,291
Yeah, I've been waiting!

240
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:27,041
Let's go!

241
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:41,208
The sky's so pretty!

242
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:43,416
Yeah!

243
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,125
The sky over Iwato!

244
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:55,958
What are you doing here?

245
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:57,458
Why isn't Ao with you?

246
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:03,625
That looks like Goldilocks!

247
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:08,375
Aw!

248
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:10,333
Why are you running away?

249
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:12,708
So many teddy bears!

250
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:14,125
Teddy! Teddy!

251
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:16,250
Come on!
Come to Chloe!

252
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,416
Alex!

253
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,166
The children are they ok?

254
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,833
I shut down their systems.

255
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:34,833
We're about to open
up the cockpits.

256
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:41,416
Let me go!

257
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,500
The teddy bear!

258
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:45,958
Right, bring them
here immediately.

259
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:47,291
Just hold still now, okay?

260
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:47,833
I have to save her!

261
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:49,166
Maman, Please!!

262
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,708
Maman! Maman!

263
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:52,666
Our medical team has
assured us that giving you

264
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,958
oxygen will stop
the hallucinations.

265
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:56,458
Start treatment.

266
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:58,500
Maman! Maman!

267
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,375
Georg's theory was correct.

268
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:07,625
The Trapars are
complicating things.

269
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:09,583
Those minute foreign
particles that got into

270
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:12,208
their bodies are reacting
with the Trapars in the air,

271
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:14,666
flooding their brains
with too many stimuli.

272
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,291
We adults aren't affected by it,

273
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:19,208
but their brains have
absorbed Trapars since birth.

274
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:21,666
That causes them to react
differently than we would.

275
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,958
The stimuli
induce hallucinations.

276
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:25,250
I can have maintenance reinforce

277
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:27,000
the air conditioning
filters so the Trapars

278
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:29,416
can be extracted from the air.

279
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,666
But we still need
to figure out how

280
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:33,666
to get that stuff safely
out of their bodies.

281
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,750
To think every one of those
tiny particles is a Secret.

282
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:39,208
I'm concerned about
how this will affect them.

283
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:40,958
In particular Ao.

284
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:43,708
You know he differs
from us genetically.

285
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:46,291
Ao, and Elena, as well.

286
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:52,125
Where are we?

287
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:53,375
Shh.

288
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,041
Wow!

289
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:02,875
That's crazy!

290
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:03,875
What is this?

291
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:05,458
Don't you remember
what you said?

292
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:08,416
You told me that you wanted
to see the real thing.

293
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,791
Here we are!

294
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:12,916
This venue is normally
adults only, so we're lucky.

295
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:18,958
Hey, Miller.

296
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:20,708
That's you, isn't it?

297
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:22,041
Where have you been hiding?

298
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,500
Your absence has
been noticed, Miller.

299
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:27,541
Anyway, your presence
has been requested, come.

300
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:29,833
Ao, Elena.

301
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:35,750
Come on!

302
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:37,250
We have to go!

303
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:47,583
Hey!

304
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:48,916
I thought we were
at headquarters!

305
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,208
We were being tricked
into thinking that.

306
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:53,041
This isn't the
real world anymore.

307
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:54,541
We're someplace else.

308
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:55,875
Some different world.

309
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:57,750
Ao, you can get us
back where we belong.

310
00:17:57,833 --> 00:17:58,916
I'm sure of it!

311
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,583
Okay, I guess I can try.

312
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:03,666
Let's go!

313
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:09,458
That's the SDF!

314
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:11,625
Pippo's dad and some other guys.

315
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:14,875
Elena, take Ao.
I've got this.

316
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:24,291
Why would a member
of Team Pied Piper

317
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:27,333
be posing as an operative
and sending us information?

318
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:29,666
Feeding us fake intel, maybe?

319
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:32,875
No, that isn't it!

320
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:34,750
That's impossible.

321
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:36,791
Things will be different

322
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:38,250
when we're back in
the real world, Ao.

323
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:39,291
Yeah?

324
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:40,958
It'll be a lot easier.

325
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:43,375
We won't have to
fight anyone there.

326
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:44,250
We'll just--

327
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:45,625
Quit while you're ahead, Miller.

328
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,458
It's like you're setting the
flag for your own death.

329
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:49,750
Oh, it is, huh?

330
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:53,125
Uh, what was that about a flag?

331
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:54,833
Am I missing the joke here?

332
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:03,500
Should we fire a warning shot?

333
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:04,625
Not necessary.

334
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:05,916
The car's electric.

335
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,833
It's been adjusted to
block the direct intake

336
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:10,250
of air from outside.

337
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:12,291
Can you hear me?

338
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:13,083
Ao?

339
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:13,875
Elena?

340
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:14,833
Hey that's the chief!

341
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:16,166
Don't let them fool you.

342
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,875
We have to get out
of this place, together.

343
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:20,041
She's right, Ao.

344
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:21,500
I know, I've seen it.

345
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:24,916
A different place, somewhere
outside this stupid world.

346
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,416
You've been looking
for it, too, haven't you?

347
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:30,083
Don't worry, I'll do it!

348
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:32,666
I'll find a way to
get you off the island.

349
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:35,458
Island?

350
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:38,000
Naru, Mama!

351
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:48,666
You know, you remind
me a lot of myself.

352
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,833
I bet we could have been related
in a past life or something.

353
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:53,916
Then, maybe you know.

354
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,916
Huh?

355
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:55,916
Who am I?

356
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,916
Tell me!

357
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,625
You know, don't you Miller?

358
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:07,333
So, it's me.

359
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,083
Elena!

360
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:14,250
Elena!

361
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:14,875
What're you doing?

362
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:15,958
She's a spy!

363
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:17,541
We've been infiltrated
by the enemy.

364
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:19,208
The enemy?

365
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:26,833
Fire!

366
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:28,291
Stop the car!

367
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:43,833
What did I say to you
about setting your flag?

368
00:20:57,833 --> 00:20:58,833
Noa!

369
00:20:58,916 --> 00:21:00,125
I've been looking
for you, fur ball.

370
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:01,875
Where have you been?

371
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:07,125
Really?

372
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:08,458
You're sure about that?

373
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:11,000
Yes, they were definitely
two different people.

374
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:14,250
Of course, Miller is nothing
more than a pile of ashes now.

375
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:16,500
I can't fund any
further investigation.

376
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:17,875
Wait, sir! Hold on!

377
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:19,291
Hey!

378
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,875
And after we finally
found somebody

379
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:23,500
who knew the Peoples family.

380
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:25,625
Her childhood's
ancient history, anyway.

381
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:29,291
So what does it
matter at this point?

382
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:30,958
We're going!

383
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:37,625
I'm surprised you're looking
into Elena's accident now,

384
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:39,250
after all this time.

385
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:40,458
Accident?

386
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:42,958
You're reopening the
investigation, right?

387
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:44,708
It was about five years ago.

388
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:47,041
Poor Elena was out on a
cruise in the Caribbean

389
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:49,500
when she was caught
in a Scub Burst.

390
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:51,708
The master took
her loss very badly.

391
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:53,416
He fell ill shortly after.

392
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,791
I don't understand.

393
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:57,750
Elena Peoples is with Gen--

394
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:03,833
Oh, that's Elena a year
before she passed away.

395
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:06,291
Wasn't she beautiful?

396
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:10,833
That means, the Elena
Peoples we know today is?

397
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:19,125
Elena, we're supposed
to be resting!

398
00:22:19,208 --> 00:22:21,375
Just giving it some water!

399
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:28,750
I was feeling blue,
but I'm better now.

400
00:22:30,375 --> 00:22:31,541
Good night, Miller.

401
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:32,708
Sleep well.

402
00:22:32,791 --> 00:22:34,666
You too, Elena.

403
00:22:36,541 --> 00:22:37,750
To be continued.

404
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:15,791
Next time on Eureka Seven AO.

405
00:24:15,875 --> 00:24:17,666
With the fate of the
world on their shoulders,

406
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,708
Pied Piper launches into space.

407
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:22,375
Combat among the stars
proves difficult for Ao.

408
00:24:22,458 --> 00:24:25,375
When all seems lost, silver
wings appear in the sky,

409
00:24:25,458 --> 00:24:28,083
and what they reveal
will shock Ao to his core.

410
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:33,791
Eureka Seven AO, Episode 12:
"heaven and earth."

411
00:24:33,875 --> 00:24:36,125
Hear the cry of the
children of the stars.
