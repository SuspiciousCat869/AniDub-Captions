1
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:11,041
Hey, look!

2
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:12,041
There!

3
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:14,000
It's a little kid!

4
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:15,500
Right in the middle of the road!

5
00:02:17,291 --> 00:02:18,583
Bang!

6
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,833
What the hell?

7
00:02:27,916 --> 00:02:30,625
Who are you?

8
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:31,500
Who is that?

9
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:32,416
Contact HQ!

10
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,041
A terrorist?

11
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:37,916
Who am I, you ask?

12
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:41,500
A very good question.

13
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:43,333
Let me see.

14
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:52,250
From this moment on...
my name is Truth.

15
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:01,541
Where's the target?

16
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:02,750
Sir, he's one floor below us!

17
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:04,125
He'll be here any second!

18
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:21,083
An intruder?

19
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:22,458
Whoever he is,

20
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:24,583
I'm sure our security teams
are up to the challenge.

21
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:26,708
But just to be safe,
the two of you sit tight.

22
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:27,541
What?

23
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:28,708
I got to stay here with him?

24
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:31,375
I sent someone
to escort you back.

25
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:34,041
If being here's so terrible,
why'd you come barging in?

26
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:35,041
Oh yeah?

27
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:36,291
Well if I hadn't
been here to help,

28
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:38,291
you wouldn't have been
able to take this call!

29
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:39,666
Yeah, I could of!

30
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,000
I'm assuming Elena
isn't with you?

31
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:42,916
Huh?

32
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
No why?

33
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:45,333
I've been trying to reach her

34
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:48,458
on the emergency frequency,
but nothing so far.

35
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:51,583
Into my civilian duds!

36
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,916
This is pretty comfy and
I am covered up, technically.

37
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,666
Wonder if I could go out
and about like this?

38
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,291
I Better not.

39
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:02,541
Think of the nosebleeds.

40
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:05,833
You're telling me we were
totally blindsided by this?

41
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:07,333
As we're seeing out there,

42
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:10,125
the element of surprise makes
for a powerful advantage.

43
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,333
According to witnesses,

44
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:14,041
this damage is being
caused by a single man.

45
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:15,791
How is this possible?

46
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:19,541
There have been casualties
among the security guards.

47
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:22,500
This is nothing we
were prepared for.

48
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:32,958
I wonder if Langley
has a hand in this.

49
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:33,916
What've you heard?

50
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,416
Nothing.

51
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,916
And the US military isn't
involved, as near as I can tell.

52
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,458
Well, take care of the data,

53
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:42,833
move the IFOs, and see that
the pilots are all secured.

54
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:47,666
Worst-case scenario, we destroy
it and scuttle the base.

55
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,500
What about him?

56
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:52,958
I wouldn't worry
Blanc with the details.

57
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:55,000
I suggest you hurry.

58
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:00,916
Attention, employees!

59
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,250
An intruder is on the
loose within the facility.

60
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:06,583
If you see him, do not engage!

61
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:08,875
I repeat, do not engage!

62
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:10,500
He is armed and dangerous!

63
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:12,041
Multiple fatalities
have been reported.

64
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:15,083
You're hard to find, Miller.
You know that?

65
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:17,375
They just told us the
gig tonight's a no-go.

66
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:19,583
Come on, we should
get to the shelter ASAP.

67
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:21,166
Totally!

68
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,333
You guys go on ahead, I'll be
right behind you in a second.

69
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:26,291
Hurry it up!

70
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:36,750
Oh man.

71
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:39,541
He's right around
the corner from here.

72
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,500
Don't move!

73
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:53,666
We've got you outnumbered!

74
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:58,583
Identify yourself!

75
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:00,000
Excuse me,
but are you Miss Miller?

76
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:00,875
Huh?

77
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:02,208
I'm a real big fan of your work.

78
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:03,375
Thanks.

79
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:04,625
Last chance!

80
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:05,875
If you want to live,

81
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:07,250
you're going to tell
us who the hell you are!

82
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:08,875
You want a name?

83
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:11,083
You may refer to me as Truth.

84
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:13,166
It's your lucky day.

85
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:16,166
My concert is about to begin.

86
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:19,083
What're you waiting for?

87
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:19,833
Shoot!

88
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:21,250
Shoot him!

89
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:36,916
And who are you, pray tell?

90
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,208
People call me, Miller.

91
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:41,458
Hmm, "Miller"?

92
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:44,166
What do you do in
this cozy little cage?

93
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,166
I'm a singer in a band.

94
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,791
So I see.

95
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:50,916
And you appear
to sing, the truth.

96
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,458
The intruder's
objective is the--

97
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:02,041
I repeat his objective
is the Coral Relic.

98
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:06,083
He'll be headed for the basement
to try and make off with it!

99
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:07,708
Sorry, guys.

100
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:10,541
He wants something, all right.

101
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:12,000
And that ain't it.

102
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:15,541
Service on all
Central Shaft Cable Lines

103
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:18,208
has been suspended
until further notice.

104
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:20,958
Service on all
Central Shaft Cable Lines

105
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:22,041
has been suspended
until further notice.

106
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:23,333
What day is it?

107
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:25,166
They were saying something
about an emergency.

108
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,791
I think it's down below, but.

109
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:28,291
This is HQ for
Generation Bleu, man.

110
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:31,333
We're safe as can be.

111
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:34,416
I'm going to hurl!

112
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:41,500
Meets a pretty girl
and goes on a bender.

113
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:42,583
Nice!

114
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:44,083
I thought it was
because we got hired on.

115
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:46,708
Glad Ao wasn't the only one
who got some love from them.

116
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:47,875
Shut up!

117
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:56,208
Ah, what the hell?

118
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:02,500
Hold on!

119
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:04,833
You busted straight
through that wall!

120
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:06,750
I'm looking for the truth.

121
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:09,916
No wall can withstand me!

122
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,791
What kind of "truth"?

123
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:13,333
He's over here!

124
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:13,791
Hey!

125
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:15,125
Watch it!

126
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:23,041
Wait!

127
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:24,625
So he's heading
to higher ground?

128
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:26,250
Are you absolutely sure?

129
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:29,458
Sir, he was last sighted at
the Central Plaza Station.

130
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:31,958
Given his path thus far,
it stands to reason that he'll--

131
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:33,041
He's bluffing!

132
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:34,333
Send men to canvas
the central shaft

133
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:36,166
that leads to the lower levels!

134
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,041
Scramble Team
Pied Piper, on the double.

135
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:39,250
What?

136
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:40,750
It's nothing to
be surprised about.

137
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:43,583
All signs point to the
intruder heading higher.

138
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:45,125
Might as well get
the team airborne.

139
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:47,750
You're telling me the IFOs
are his ultimate target?

140
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:50,708
It could be the pilots he's
after, we just don't know.

141
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:52,916
Either way, if you're correct
about him heading to the

142
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,375
lower levels, wouldn't
mobilizing all the IFOs be an

143
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:59,666
especially good idea, in terms
of getting them into the game?

144
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:00,833
"Scramble"?

145
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,125
Don't be ridiculous.

146
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,125
Nirvash isn't even
on the Triton yet!

147
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:06,791
The Nirvash is the
one we need to evacuate!

148
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:09,041
Don't tell me the US is
trying to take it back?

149
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:09,541
Ao!

150
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:11,125
Hurry it up!

151
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:13,875
If we can't load you in the next
minute or two, you launch as-is!

152
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:14,500
Uh!

153
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:15,541
Okay!

154
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:22,000
Whoa! What?

155
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:24,250
I thought I saw you up there.

156
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:26,416
I have long wanted to meet you.

157
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,958
Excuse me, but!

158
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:31,083
You mind not standing
on top of the Nirvash?

159
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:32,750
Oh my god!

160
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,125
"Nirvash"?

161
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:38,000
Interesting, and now
I know your name.

162
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:40,708
Well, what's a boy
like you doing here?

163
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:43,666
Sitting in that woman's machine?

164
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:44,708
"Woman"?

165
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:46,375
Hey, that's my mother!

166
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:48,708
Hands in the air!

167
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:50,041
Now!

168
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:51,541
If you're not off of
there by the count of three!

169
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,041
I open fire!

170
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:58,375
Rebecka, are you all right?

171
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:00,750
Don't worry about me!

172
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:01,958
Just take off!

173
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:02,833
Where do I go?

174
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:04,291
Anywhere is safer than here!

175
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:05,125
Just fly!

176
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:06,541
But what if--?

177
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:16,708
The Nirvash is taking off!

178
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:18,666
He's heading down Corridor 57!

179
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:21,458
Open Gate A-Three-Oh-Three
immediately!

180
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:28,875
Huh?

181
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:32,500
Ah, so controlling
the woman's craft seems

182
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:34,583
to be a family affair.

183
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:36,041
In that case--

184
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:54,750
You wanted to see us, sir?

185
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:56,000
Forgive me, girls.

186
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:58,625
More time recuperating
would've done you good.

187
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:01,041
That said we appreciate
your diligence.

188
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:02,958
For the time being,
at the very least,

189
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:04,875
I'll be heading up
Team Goldilocks.

190
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:06,416
Oh, okay.

191
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,291
So uh, what about
that newbie, Ao?

192
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:10,708
You mean the Fukai boy?

193
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:11,458
At the moment--

194
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:14,916
Stanley.

195
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,833
He's gone at the moment.

196
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:20,750
Hey, Gram?

197
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:22,000
I can't find Big Sis!

198
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:23,291
Flown the coop again?

199
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:25,166
I told that girl to stay in bed!

200
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:29,458
And I bet you I know
where she went.

201
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:58,541
No doubt about it.

202
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:01,208
The island changed
after you boys moved on.

203
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:03,041
Don't go pinning this on me!

204
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:06,125
Things have been different
around here for years now.

205
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:08,583
We railed so hard
against Japanese rule,

206
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:10,750
but now that we're in
bed with the Allied Forces,

207
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:12,708
it's the same damn thing.

208
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:17,625
I still talk about independence,
but nobody listens...

209
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:19,958
It's because the coral, huh?

210
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:22,250
Used to be only the
main island had Scub,

211
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:24,291
but now Iwato does, too!

212
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:27,791
The trapar harvesters swooped
in like a swarm of locusts.

213
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:29,208
Brought a bunch of jobs, though.

214
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:31,166
We're a real
boomtown these days.

215
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,791
No one's going to rock the boat

216
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:34,500
when they have full pockets.

217
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:39,208
Jiro, won't you consider
coming back home?

218
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:41,125
You could take over the
family business and I'll just--

219
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:42,416
You got to be kidding me!

220
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,791
After all those
times you called me

221
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:46,208
a good-for-nothing
waste of space?

222
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:48,208
I don't think so.

223
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:50,000
I'm at the end of my rope son.

224
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:52,333
Just like the rest of them.

225
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:54,750
You wouldn't know what
the truth was if it bit you.

226
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:56,333
And you do, is that it?

227
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:58,000
Not yet, but I'm gonna.

228
00:12:58,083 --> 00:12:59,916
The guys at the
top of the food-chain

229
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,875
don't want the
truth getting out.

230
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:04,583
They act like they
got something to hide.

231
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:09,000
It's on.

232
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:12,541
I'm going to track down the
truth that you weren't able to.

233
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:23,041
Seems like things
are really picking up.

234
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:25,000
Yeah.

235
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:32,083
Hey, isn't that?

236
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:37,875
You're supposed to
be home in bed, Naru!

237
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:40,000
I know, Dad,
and I'm sorry, but..,!

238
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:41,083
I don't want to hear it!

239
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:43,000
What if you get
sicker because of this?

240
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:45,125
Please, just go home
and get some rest!

241
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:47,833
Can you do that for me?

242
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:49,875
Yeah.

243
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:08,000
Ao?

244
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:16,083
You know they're
going to catch us,

245
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:17,916
and my cough will get worse.

246
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,500
If you want to see the coral,
let's make it happen.

247
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:23,583
Yeah, but the Scub
on the main island's

248
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:26,375
what made me sick
in the first place.

249
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:30,833
Hey, an alley!

250
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:33,958
I think we can sneak
in through here.

251
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:37,708
It's kind of creepy.

252
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:39,791
I believe in you.

253
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:00,708
You know, you've
changed a bit, Ao.

254
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:01,958
You think so?

255
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:04,208
I don't feel any different.

256
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:05,791
Why'd you come back home?

257
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:08,208
And what's Generation Bleu like?

258
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:10,000
They're nothing special.

259
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:11,875
And I came back.

260
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:13,875
So that I could see you.

261
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:16,708
You really mean it?

262
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:21,166
I have to know, the truth.

263
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:40,916
But I--!

264
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,583
You don't need this.

265
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:51,791
I want you to
take a deep breath.

266
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:53,458
Huh?

267
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:59,875
That's crazy, it doesn't hurt.

268
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:00,958
Yeah, I know.

269
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:02,041
What?

270
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:04,166
Just being here with you.

271
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:07,833
It feels good being
together again.

272
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:47,916
Naru!

273
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:57,541
What is the meaning of this?

274
00:16:57,625 --> 00:17:00,458
Naru?

275
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:01,875
Ao?

276
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:06,166
Well, the son of
the Nirvash pilot.

277
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:10,458
Why'd you go to Naru pretending
that you were me, huh?

278
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:12,750
Naru is a lovely
name you know that?

279
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:14,416
You leave her alone!

280
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:25,583
Are you okay?

281
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:32,083
Wait up!

282
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:45,750
Look alive!

283
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:47,500
We're going after them!

284
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:53,000
So, when did they
build this crap?

285
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:53,916
Give me a lift!

286
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,583
Hey, let me go!

287
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:56,958
Did you fall on your
head or something?

288
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:58,416
What's wrong with you?

289
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:02,166
That's, the Sea Colossus!

290
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,708
What are you doing in
my hometown, you faker?

291
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:06,208
I think you're
a being who exists

292
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:09,125
in close proximity to
the truth of this world.

293
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:11,791
And as such, you intrigue me.

294
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:14,791
That said, Naru
intrigues me even more!

295
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:16,125
Shut up!

296
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:17,791
She's got nothing
to do with this!

297
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:20,375
You just keep telling
yourself that, all right?

298
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:22,041
Leave her alone!

299
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:34,250
Whoa! Change of plans!

300
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:36,375
That thing is nightmare fuel!

301
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,208
It was you.

302
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:11,291
The Sea Colossus.

303
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:13,708
Thanks for the ride!

304
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,666
Huh?

305
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,333
Wait!

306
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:22,750
Naru!

307
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,791
Naru!

308
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,625
You can fly.

309
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:36,083
Trust me!

310
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:57,125
Quick, Naru, give me your hand!

311
00:19:57,208 --> 00:20:00,541
That guy is dangerous!

312
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:04,125
Sorry, but no!

313
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:05,458
You've got to snap
out of it, Naru!

314
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:07,000
He's not the real me!

315
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:08,666
I knew that from the beginning,

316
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,625
because the real you
would've brought Noa.

317
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:11,708
Then why?

318
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:13,125
Because he's him.

319
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:17,375
He was my Sea Colossus,
all those years ago.

320
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:18,333
Naru?

321
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:19,833
With him, I'm not sick.

322
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:21,166
And I can fly.

323
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,250
Please, take me with you!

324
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:24,833
What're you doing?

325
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:40,000
Ao, this world is
wrong, you know that.

326
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:42,916
Oh no!

327
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,875
Naru!

328
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,916
Where am I?

329
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,833
The hospital, you've been
asleep for three whole days now.

330
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:03,083
Hospital?

331
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:04,875
Yeah, how could you forget it?

332
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:08,000
You flew away with that guy
stuck to the top of the Mark I.

333
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:09,166
Crashed pretty hard.

334
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:10,500
We rushed out to provide backup,

335
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:12,166
but there was no
sign of the assailant.

336
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:14,666
Just you and your downed craft,

337
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,791
both of who were
pretty banged up.

338
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,000
The recovery team pulled you

339
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:19,833
from the Mark I and
brought you here.

340
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:22,541
Meanwhile, it sounds like
the Public Safety Department

341
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:26,041
is looking for our mystery man.

342
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:27,458
Thank goodness.

343
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:30,583
It was just a nightmare.

344
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:31,625
There's more.

345
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:32,875
Yeah?

346
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,250
Rebecka said not to tell you,

347
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:37,166
but it doesn't seem fair
keeping you in the dark.

348
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:40,458
There's a story that's
been going around the news.

349
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:45,500
There was a kidnapping at
the coral plant near your home.

350
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:49,625
That's your friend, right?

351
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:55,666
Do you have any idea
how much of our budget

352
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:58,125
we threw away trying
to acquire the Mark I?

353
00:21:58,208 --> 00:22:00,583
There are no sure
things in life, gentlemen.

354
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:02,041
If I may be frank,
our country shouldn't

355
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:04,791
be using IFOs as a
crutch in the first place.

356
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:05,666
You bastard!

357
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,500
That said, we can't sit idly by

358
00:22:07,583 --> 00:22:11,708
and let Generation Bleu do
whatever they want with it.

359
00:22:11,791 --> 00:22:13,750
We spent the people's
tax money on this.

360
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:16,750
We'll make them rue
the day they took it.

361
00:22:18,291 --> 00:22:19,291
Right!

362
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:21,083
Straight from our
mole in their HQ.

363
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:23,125
Yeah, it's all in the report.

364
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:25,958
Goes by the name of
Truth, apparently.

365
00:22:26,041 --> 00:22:28,333
But I'm thinking he's our guy.

366
00:22:28,416 --> 00:22:31,208
Also, Generation Bleu's
still keeping you-know-what

367
00:22:31,291 --> 00:22:33,750
under wraps down
in the basement.

368
00:22:36,958 --> 00:22:38,000
To be continued!

369
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,708
Next time on Eureka Seven AO.

370
00:24:15,791 --> 00:24:18,125
Having lost Naru to
his mysterious rival,

371
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:20,583
Ao's feelings gnaw away at him.

372
00:24:20,666 --> 00:24:22,083
Fleur's resentment
towards her father

373
00:24:22,166 --> 00:24:24,541
finds an outlet in combat.

374
00:24:24,625 --> 00:24:28,458
What will the two gain in the
wasteland at which they arrive?

375
00:24:28,541 --> 00:24:33,958
Eureka Seven AO, Episode 8:
"blue thunder."

376
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:36,250
Hear the cry of the
children of the stars.
