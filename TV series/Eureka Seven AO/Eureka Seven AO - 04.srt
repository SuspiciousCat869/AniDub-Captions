1
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,750
I told them the
Mark I was wasted

2
00:01:55,833 --> 00:01:57,458
on the Smithsonian.

3
00:01:57,541 --> 00:01:58,916
Now they know.

4
00:02:06,416 --> 00:02:07,916
Very well then.

5
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Let's see who's stronger.

6
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:18,375
The Mark I has reappeared.

7
00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:19,583
The Mark I?

8
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:21,333
I've sent open calls.

9
00:02:21,416 --> 00:02:24,208
But so far, neither the
JAF nor the Allied Forces

10
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:26,166
has responded to
our communications.

11
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,833
We're getting the cold shoulder.

12
00:02:27,916 --> 00:02:29,708
What are they
hoping to accomplish?

13
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:31,958
Nothing, I'd guess.

14
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:34,791
They must not know how to
work their radios properly.

15
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:35,833
Huh?

16
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:40,250
That is one possible
interpretation.

17
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:41,541
Hey, Nirvash.

18
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:44,291
All this flashing
starting to get annoying.

19
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:46,708
Think you could cut it out?

20
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:50,375
Reset to easy mode.

21
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:52,125
Whatever, that's fine.

22
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:53,708
How about weapons?

23
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,791
It's all a bunch a technobabble.

24
00:02:57,875 --> 00:03:01,166
I guess it won't be as
easy as it is in anime.

25
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:12,166
Wait, what was that?

26
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,708
Please summon your captain!

27
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:16,833
The JAF has claimed
ownership of that craft!

28
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:18,875
The OSDF doesn't--!

29
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:22,583
Awesome!

30
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:24,750
Conventional weapons
won't work against them!

31
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:41,500
With weapons like
that the Secret

32
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:43,333
can see their every move!

33
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:44,125
Elena go!

34
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:45,416
Yeah, yeah.

35
00:03:58,166 --> 00:03:59,375
Sent!

36
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:07,041
Let's rock this!

37
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:08,833
Okay?

38
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:24,833
All Goliaths have
found their marks.

39
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:26,416
Prep for second wave.

40
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:29,166
Aw!

41
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,666
Were you scared?

42
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:31,875
I'm fine thank you.

43
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:33,833
Wait you did that on purpose!

44
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:35,833
Fleur. You need to
break away for now.

45
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:37,000
But that's not fair!

46
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:38,458
You're pulling me
from the front again?

47
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:40,750
No.

48
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:42,041
We need you.

49
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:45,458
There's another child
for us to protect.

50
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:46,833
Huh?

51
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:49,125
So that's what that means.

52
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:51,125
I'm getting the hang of this!

53
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:55,791
Okay, time to see you
in your humanoid form!

54
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:04,625
Forgot about that.

55
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:06,625
It's charging into the ZOA.

56
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:07,375
Fleur, no!

57
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:08,875
Watch out!

58
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,416
Oh, lovely!

59
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,166
We've got to get outta the ZOA!

60
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,333
Ow!

61
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:38,833
I knew it.

62
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:40,250
I was right about you.

63
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:42,583
You were the pilot, Ao Fukai.

64
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:44,250
Did I step on someone's toes?

65
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:46,625
Only you guys can
fight a G-Monster?

66
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:50,916
It's only outside the ZOA that
Secrets can't detect IFOs.

67
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,458
The ZOA?

68
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:53,541
Yeah.

69
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:54,875
It stands for
"Zone Out of Action."

70
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:57,083
Inside it Secrets are
able to find the location

71
00:05:57,166 --> 00:06:00,125
of IFOs within twenty
to thirty seconds.

72
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:03,166
You were going to fight
without even knowing that much?

73
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:06,916
Oh, no!

74
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,125
Please get out of the way.

75
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:09,500
It's the G-Monster!

76
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:12,083
Oh, quit worrying.

77
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:14,458
We're outside the ZOA here.

78
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:23,291
We're fine as long as
we don't initiate combat.

79
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:24,125
Stay here.

80
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:26,000
We'll talk about this later.

81
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:28,041
No hide-and-seek, please.

82
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:29,583
You're still fighting?

83
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:30,791
Can you win?

84
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:32,166
Win or lose.

85
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:35,125
I'm not going to leave
my friend to do this alone.

86
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:37,875
Okay, I'm coming too.

87
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:38,916
What?

88
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,458
If the G-Monster
destroys the island,

89
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:43,416
it'll be catastrophic, right?

90
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:46,416
The magnitude of a Scub Burst
is typically four times

91
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,791
that of the combined size
of the Coral and the Sec--

92
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,791
I'm going to
protect this island.

93
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:53,875
I have to.

94
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:56,458
It's my home.

95
00:06:56,541 --> 00:07:00,583
Or, well, it was anyway.

96
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:03,625
After all this, that's
probably going to change.

97
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:07,416
Fleur.

98
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,333
It's getting dicey here.

99
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:11,958
I'm going.

100
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:14,291
Stay here and you'll be fine.

101
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:16,833
Can you lure them away?

102
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:18,041
If the fighters are occupied,

103
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:20,083
I can get close
to the main ship.

104
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:22,208
Did you hear what
I just said about the ZOA?

105
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:24,458
I'll have twenty to
thirty seconds, right?

106
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:26,291
How interesting.

107
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:28,458
That would be
an effective tactic.

108
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:30,041
Who is that?

109
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:33,000
The Mark I primarily
uses physical projectiles,

110
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:35,458
meaning he is more
useful at close range.

111
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:36,708
Of course, with only one arm,

112
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:38,916
his offensive capabilities
are cut in half.

113
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,458
This is nuts.

114
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:44,583
He's green and how can we trust
our fate to a damaged craft?

115
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:46,833
Fleur, here are your orders.

116
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:48,291
Ivica!

117
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:51,166
It's about protecting
the children.

118
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:55,583
If it comes down to it, we'll
use the Triton to shield him.

119
00:07:56,875 --> 00:08:00,416
Fleur, map out his course
and the countdown for him.

120
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:03,958
This enables communications.

121
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:06,416
We'll be able to hear you,
too, do you understand?

122
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,125
Yes, ma'am.

123
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,500
First it was babysitting
and now playing a decoy.

124
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:19,625
This is not what
I signed up for!

125
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:21,333
Data sent.

126
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:23,000
Get ready, Ao!

127
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:25,541
Eighty seconds.

128
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,875
I can do this.

129
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:31,250
Let's go.

130
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:37,166
Elena, are you ready?

131
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,250
If I die, I can be replaced.

132
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:42,083
This is no time to be
spouting off manga quotes!

133
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:44,541
Well, it's not
manga; it's anime.

134
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:17,708
It's compatible with
Kyrie's replacement parts?

135
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,625
All the IFOs were built conform

136
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:22,000
to the general
standards of the Mark I.

137
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:27,125
After all, what could we
do but blindly copy it?

138
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:34,583
Now Nirvash! Open fire!

139
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,583
I'm detected.

140
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:53,125
Oh, well! Too late!

141
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,125
Oh, Ao.

142
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:23,916
It's him.

143
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,541
This has to be his doing!

144
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,000
Naru! Naru!

145
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,250
Naru.

146
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:33,500
Ao!

147
00:10:58,666 --> 00:11:02,541
The Scub Coral may be releasing
toxic substances into the air.

148
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:04,333
Until authorities can
be certain it is safe,

149
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:05,583
the area within a radius

150
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:08,375
of three kilometers
will be restricted.

151
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:10,500
What about the toxic substances?

152
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:14,000
Gen. Bleu is in there and they
aren't wearing any masks.

153
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:16,291
I don't know.

154
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,166
Listen, Pippo, there
comes a time in life

155
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:20,458
when a man must make sacrifices.

156
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:25,833
Reo!

157
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:27,875
Papa!

158
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:29,625
Sorry!

159
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:30,458
Hey! Hold it!

160
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:31,500
Get back here!

161
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:32,791
Hey!

162
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:13,166
The Burst is dying down.

163
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:16,750
It's just like the Plant
near the main island.

164
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:20,166
I'll be damned if I let
those bastards take Ao!

165
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:39,875
It was years ago.

166
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:41,041
There was a young woman

167
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:45,041
who saved my life,
a woman with blue hair.

168
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:48,583
The boy, Ao.

169
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:51,625
He's Eureka's son?

170
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:02,708
Our company has
a program dedicated

171
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:06,583
to taking care
of children like him.

172
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:09,750
He's old enough to start
making his own decisions.

173
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:12,583
I will leave it up to him.

174
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:14,875
And you'll honor his choice?

175
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:15,458
What happened to Ao?

176
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:16,541
Where is he?

177
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:17,708
Please take me to him!

178
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:19,208
And you are?

179
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:20,583
Naru.

180
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:22,708
Naru Arata.

181
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:23,791
Now, please!

182
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:24,625
Ao needs me!

183
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:26,750
I know he does!

184
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:35,500
When you see my boy,
give him a message for me.

185
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:38,250
Please, tell him this.

186
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:01,708
Nirvash will be okay, right?

187
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:02,750
It'll be fine.

188
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:04,083
That beach is deserted.

189
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:07,041
Even the kids are staying
away from it nowadays.

190
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:08,583
You rescue me from the sea

191
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:10,958
and now all this,
I don't understand.

192
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:13,416
Don't worry about it, kay?

193
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,083
It's fine.

194
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:16,333
Amazing how it's grown

195
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:18,916
since we started mining
trapar ten years ago.

196
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,166
Okinawa has the highest rate

197
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,958
of FP ownership in
the world, you know.

198
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:24,708
Wow.

199
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:31,041
♪ We don't need
no Allied Forces. ♪

200

205
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:46,625
Return the rights
to the Coral Plant.

206
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:48,750
They belong to Okinawa!

207
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:50,041
Have you read Johansson?

208
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:53,083
The entire world is
crying out for the truth!

209
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:01,500
Let's go.

210
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:02,833
Yeah.

211
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:08,541
It's like that every
day on the main island.

212
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:09,750
Technically we're independent,

213
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:11,791
but with the Allies'
interference, tourism,

214
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:15,000
and fishing have been wiped out.

215
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:18,416
I guess I didn't realize how
many people were unhappy.

216
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:23,083
He's got no home to go to?

217
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:24,458
What're you going to do?

218
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:27,041
I figure he can bunk in
the dorm at my work for now.

219
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:28,375
It's good, huh?

220
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:30,583
I had a feeling you'd like
my big sister's cooking.

221
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:32,541
Yeah it's really delicious!

222
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:36,541
I just love your dye job.

223
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:37,833
Adorable!

224
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:39,416
You should try that, brother.

225
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,375
Maybe then you would get a date.

226
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:43,833
Thanks for this.

227
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:45,916
Your sister is really nice.

228
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:55,375
See there's this guy I met.

229
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:57,416
He's with Intelligence.

230
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,958
You would sell
him to the Allies?

231
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,833
He's just a boy.

232
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:02,208
You saw his hair, right?

233
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:06,458
Japan and the Allied Forces
are both after that IFO.

234
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:09,083
If he's involved,
I can get good money--

235
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,375
Well sis, thanks for the food.

236
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:30,541
Good things come your way

237
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:33,166
when you do what
the Americans want!

238
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:57,791
Hey, why are you doing this?

239
00:16:57,875 --> 00:16:59,375
I was only a kid

240
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:02,458
when the G-Monsters
appeared on the main island.

241
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:05,000
You survived the attack?

242
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,625
I was saved by a giant.

243
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:08,333
What?

244
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:10,166
Sounds crazy, right?

245
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,750
It looked like the
one you piloted.

246
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:15,833
I think they're the same.

247
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:17,708
We're getting off soon.

248
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:18,666
This is it?

249
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:19,666
You work here?

250
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,000
Yeah.

251
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:24,708
It's the largest trapar
mining plant in the world.

252
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:38,041
You jerk!

253
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:49,416
I have a message for
you from your grandfather.

254
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:54,291
That giant you flew,
it belonged to your mother.

255
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,125
Ten years ago, she took the IFO
and headed for the Scub Burst.

256
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:02,916
As you know, she
hasn't been seen since.

257
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,166
If you decide
to pilot the giant,

258
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:10,166
the same thing
will happen to you.

259
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,333
Promise me, Ao.

260
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:12,791
Don't die.

261
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:19,958
Unfortunately, we still don't
understand her disappearance.

262
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:23,875
No one knows what
happened to Eureka.

263
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:26,375
But if I do it.

264
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:32,208
If I pilot the Nirvash,
maybe, maybe someday

265
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:35,208
I'll find the
path my mother took.

266
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:37,125
Maybe.

267
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:44,666
Please, sir.

268
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:47,125
I would like to join
Generation Bleu!

269
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:03,541
Target's at the Coral Plant.

270
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:05,208
I want them both.

271
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:07,000
Boy and the Mark I.

272
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:12,416
You've got wings after all, Ao.

273
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,458
They're going to take you
away from the island.

274
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:17,666
I guess so.

275
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,166
If my mom's alive,

276
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:24,250
I have to find her somehow
but I'll never forgive my dad.

277
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,833
There's something else Ao.

278
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:31,458
I need to...

279
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:34,291
Gram and Miyu will
take good care of you.

280
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:37,916
And try not to fight with
your dad too much, okay?

281
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,333
Yeah.

282
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:44,333
I know, maybe those
guys can help out.

283
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:47,250
They might know of
some way to cure you.

284
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:49,583
Are you talking about them?

285
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:52,000
Generation Bleu?

286
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:53,791
They take on G-Monsters right?

287
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:56,333
I'm sure they
know lots of stuff.

288
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:03,083
Take her with you.

289
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:04,250
Huh?

290
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:06,250
She seems to like the
Gen. Bleu people.

291
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:08,541
I can't.

292
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,333
I have nothing else to give.

293
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:12,166
You should take her with you.

294
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:15,541
What are those?

295
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:19,708
Look!

296
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:22,666
I think, they're Allied IFOs!

297
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:26,250
What are the Allied
Forces doing here?

298
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:28,166
The same thing we are.

299
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:29,750
They must've
hacked into the taxi

300
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:32,500
and determined his location
using the onboard camera.

301
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:36,291
Guess we're thinking along
the same lines and the Mark I?

302
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:39,125
The Mark I is currently
preparing for takeoff.

303
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:41,291
It shouldn't be much longer.

304
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:44,708
Thank you for keeping
it hidden away for me.

305
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:47,375
I wouldn't be here
if it weren't for him.

306
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:48,833
That's true for lots of us.

307
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:50,541
Not just me.

308
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:55,416
Naru, stand back!

309
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:00,583
I'm going now.

310
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:08,375
We'll bring you aboard
the Triton right away.

311
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:09,333
We're not fighting?

312
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:10,041
Why not?

313
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:11,583
It's the Allied Forces!

314
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:14,208
To another IFO we'll be
fully visible, like normal.

315
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:17,666
So, basically, you
wouldn't stand a chance.

316
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:18,916
Who's that?

317
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:53,541
Generation Bleu, huh?

318
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:55,125
I'll slap them with
a formal request,

319
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:57,416
demanding its surrender.

320
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:07,958
Sorry.

321
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:10,166
Has anybody seen Noa around?

322
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:12,166
She was just here a while ago.

323
00:22:18,416 --> 00:22:19,125
I'm freezing!

324
00:22:19,208 --> 00:22:20,625
Suck it up, Pippo.

325
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:22,541
If you hadn't been chased
by those Dobermans,

326
00:22:22,625 --> 00:22:25,500
we'd be a lot
better off right now.

327
00:22:25,583 --> 00:22:28,125
Oh, a sweater!

328
00:22:32,166 --> 00:22:34,583
This sucks!

329
00:22:36,375 --> 00:22:37,625
To be continued!

330
00:24:13,125 --> 00:24:15,416
Next time on Eureka Seven AO.

331
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,541
Beyond the haze,
Ao sees a black tower

332
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:20,416
jutting above white clouds.

333
