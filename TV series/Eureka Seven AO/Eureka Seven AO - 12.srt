1
00:01:56,166 --> 00:01:58,125
Poor Noa, I wonder
what she's doing?

2
00:01:58,208 --> 00:01:59,708
If we'd made her
a little spacesuit,

3
00:01:59,791 --> 00:02:01,416
she could've come along.

4
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,250
This is not an anime!

5
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:05,875
There's no budget for
that stuff in real life.

6
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:07,958
Sounds just like
her dad, doesn't she?

7
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:09,250
Don't, I mean it!

8
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:12,166
She's got to be
feeling lonely, and sad.

9
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,916
She hasn't seen Naru
in a while, either.

10
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:51,583
Thanks for that.

11
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:55,166
It says it can breathe
much better now.

12
00:02:57,916 --> 00:02:59,375
Come here.

13
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,875
I'm still getting used to this.

14
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:15,125
I can't believe how much freer
I feel when I'm near you.

15
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:17,125
That's because you
aren't actually ill.

16
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:18,833
It's just seemed so
because you have a piece

17
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:21,458
of Scub Coral growing
inside of you.

18
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:24,250
Why are you so kind only to me?

19
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:25,791
You think I'm kind?

20
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:27,833
First time I've ever heard that.

21
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,916
You do everything I ask.

22
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,208
And you're always by my side,

23
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:35,750
even though I've never
done anything for you.

24
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:37,125
We're the same, you and I.

25
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:39,291
Whatever helps you, helps me.

26
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:41,000
We are both seeking the truth.

27
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:43,500
We both see the
wrong in the world.

28
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:45,625
I still say you're kind.

29
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:48,375
You have done something
that was just for me.

30
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:50,541
You didn't kill Ao
when you could have.

31
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:52,416
So, thank you.

32
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:56,000
Ao Fukai.

33
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:59,791
In time, he too,
will see the truth.

34
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:27,166
Amazing.

35
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:34,458
Hey, this place is
pretty strange, huh?

36
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,666
Our headquarters was
built by recycling

37
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:47,958
unfamiliar structures discovered
in various Scub Corals.

38
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:50,791
I believe that was how
it was explained to you?

39
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:52,250
Uh... yes, sir.

40
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,208
I was also told the
Gazelle Agency was

41
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:56,541
an independent reserve
unit, and that we have

42
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:58,875
the freedom to go where
we deem necessary.

43
00:04:58,958 --> 00:04:59,958
Yet, one hundred percent

44
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:01,833
of your funding
comes from our company.

45
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:04,500
So we expect to be kept
in the loop at all times.

46
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:05,750
It's no big deal.

47
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:08,083
We just wanted to see
this area for ourselves

48
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:11,583
to determine what the
US agent was investigating.

49
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:14,125
You see, nothing sinister.

50
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:16,166
It's just the
remains of a test site.

51
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:19,500
We have it sealed off due
to contamination concerns.

52
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:21,416
Oh man!

53
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,791
I thought there would be a heap

54
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:25,375
of Quartz so it's
not what I expected.

55
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:26,208
No, sorry.

56
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:27,958
You won't find Quartz here.

57
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:29,208
We're not buying that.

58
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:32,625
We know the teams
always collect them.

59
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:36,166
Still, as I said,
they're not here.

60
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:54,250
This whole space thing,
I'm not a fan of it!

61
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:56,000
I'm heading this way.

62
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:58,500
What for?

63
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:00,125
She's going to
transfer the Quartz.

64
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:02,791
The ones we collected
from the Corals?

65
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:04,333
They're all up here?

66
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:18,250
Silicon?

67
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:20,875
Well, depicting zero-G in
animation is pretty difficult.

68
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:22,458
What's that got to do with it?

69
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:26,291
We just finished
up in the kitchen.

70
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:27,916
You've got great timing!

71
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,208
Oh, cool!

72
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:31,791
Is that a butler?

73
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:35,000
Everyone, meet Chief
Hannah of Team Harlequin.

74
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,250
You must be Ao?

75
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,458
I knew you right away!

76
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:44,041
With hair like that,
who wouldn't?

77
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:45,416
Chief, it's nice to--

78
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,875
Awe, Mom.

79
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:48,958
That's what everyone
around here calls me.

80
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:51,250
Okay.

81
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:54,041
Wow! So you really are an alien!

82
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:55,708
An alien? What?

83
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:57,791
Come on, let's
all have some tea!

84
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:00,083
I think we should get
right to the meeting.

85
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:02,208
I've just got one
more set to go.

86
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:03,250
Liu Yin.

87
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:04,708
Okay!

88
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:07,250
Coffee for you,
I believe, Ivica?

89
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:13,416
Yet another thing
I hate about space.

90
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,250
The computer here is Georg, too?

91
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:19,208
I am one, Ao Fukai, no
matter where you see me.

92
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:20,625
Allow me to explain.

93
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:21,875
I am not, in fact, a computer,
but an operating syst--

94
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:23,208
That's him.

95
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:23,916
We're all set!

96
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,916
Come, have some cake!

97
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:38,125
That thing is for the
Planet War Initiative.

98
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,625
Yes, so I've heard.

99
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:42,958
It was created to intercept
ballistic missiles in space.

100
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:45,208
You can't just take
it out for a spin.

101
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:46,250
Why not?

102
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:47,416
It won't be hard.

103
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,791
I've already
hijacked its circuitry.

104
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:52,041
Firecracker strikes again.

105
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:54,791
I just thought you would
like to be kept informed.

106
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:55,666
Goodbye.

107
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:58,125
Professor J. Johansson.

108
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:03,583
Johansson committed
suicide several years ago.

109
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:06,000
But not before writing
the Johansson Book.

110
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:07,750
A work some of his
adherents consider

111
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:10,125
to be a book of prophecy.

112
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:13,041
The professor
had an adopted son.

113
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:16,875
And I'm looking at him
right now, aren't I?

114
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:20,500
Do you know what Johansson said?

115
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:24,583
He said however you look
at it, the world is wrong.

116
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:30,416
Ordinarily even if
a Scub Burst in space

117
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,291
should cause a fusion blast,

118
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:35,208
it would not harm us
here on Earth's surface.

119
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:38,333
However, the current
situation is much trickier.

120
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:39,750
The Scub has
appeared at an altitude

121
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:41,583
within the low Earth orbit.

122
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:44,208
Due to the high concentration
of satellites there,

123
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:47,416
a fusion blast could produce
massive amounts of debris.

124
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,666
Keeping that in mind,
the United Nations

125
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:52,041
has commissioned Generation
Bleu to eliminate the Secret.

126
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:54,291
Does that feel good, or what?

127
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:55,791
The entire world
is depending on us

128
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:58,250
to successfully
carry out this mission.

129
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:01,291
International rescuers
to global saviors!

130
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:03,125
Unless we fail, in
which case our sponsors

131
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:06,041
will wash their hands
of us quick enough.

132
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:07,916
Why are we the ones
they're sending out?

133
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,916
There's already a
team based up here.

134
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Harlequin is different.

135
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,416
They get special treatment.

136
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,666
Kind of like you?

137
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:18,166
Technically, Harlequin's
our backup team.

138
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,083
But that title's
just window dressing.

139
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:21,416
They're really something else.

140
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,166
The guardians of the Quartz!

141
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,375
What does that mean?

142
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:26,500
Though the Seven Days
of Fire may come,

143
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:29,041
and all on the Earth's surface
be razed to the ground,

144
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:30,833
they will survive!

145
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:32,625
That's why there are multiple
families living here.

146
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:34,500
Seven Days of what?

147
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:36,833
That part was just
Elena being dramatic.

148
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:39,125
The rest of it is
probably true, though.

149
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:42,291
Even if all the rest of
us die, they'll survive?

150
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:44,791
Oh, just shut up and get ready!

151
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:50,458
Our IFOs won't move like
we're used to out in space.

152
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:53,000
We'll have to finish
this with one strike.

153
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:54,083
Ao?

154
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:55,875
Hey, did you hear me?

155
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,208
Something's wrong.

156
00:09:58,291 --> 00:09:59,500
What happened?

157
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:01,666
The sky's different here.

158
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:05,916
The path in the wind,
I can't see it.

159
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,041
I was afraid of this.

160
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:09,208
You care to explain?

161
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:10,833
Listen get back here, Ao!

162
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:13,291
Fleur and Elena, you stand by.

163
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,541
Change of plans!

164
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:16,791
The Secret will make
contact before long!

165
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:19,125
Up here, Mom's word is law.

166
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:34,291
What's the path in the wind?

167
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:36,708
I've always been able
to see it, until now.

168
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:39,916
It was there, just waiting for
me whenever I was flying.

169
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,125
What was?

170
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:42,625
So, for as long as
you can remember,

171
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:46,125
you've been piloting FPs by
simply following that path?

172
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,458
Well, yeah.

173
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:51,500
You guys see it, too, right?

174
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:57,958
This is an approximation
of how he sees the world.

175
00:10:58,041 --> 00:11:01,958
What Ao's seeing when he flies
isn't the wind it's the Trapars.

176
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:03,625
The boy is able to see Trapars?

177
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:05,625
There's a slight difference
in his genetic code,

178
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:08,583
involving his optic
nerve cells, remember?

179
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:09,958
That's what the lab found.

180
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:11,416
How's that possible?

181
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,291
The Trapars are tiny particles!

182
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:14,166
They're, what--?

183
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,166
Twenty nanometers in diameter.

184
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,583
No human can see
them with the naked eye.

185
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:21,708
But that's what he's seeing,
and it's also the reason

186
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:24,166
he's been performing
as well as he has.

187
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,041
I don't get it.

188
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:31,166
Why, why do you know
so much about me?

189
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:34,708
Because you're an
alien, of course.

190
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:38,750
Hey, Elena, have you
ever seen Trapars before?

191
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:40,833
No, but maybe
I need to try harder!

192
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:43,583
It's just crazy: Ao's
genetically programmed

193
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:45,666
to see the world
differently than we do.

194
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,458
That sounds like an anime line.

195
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:50,000
Yeah except it's real.

196
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:54,000
This occurred thirteen years
ago, on April 12th.

197
00:11:58,125 --> 00:11:59,666
April 12th? That's!

198
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,000
You didn't know?

199
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:08,291
It's Nirvash!

200
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:11,250
The US forces in Okinawa
called for a scramble.

201
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:13,166
This is their footage.

202
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,791
Mama!

203
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:21,000
How dare you show him
this out of the blue?

204
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:24,041
This is something he should have
been told about a long time ago.

205
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:25,458
As you can see from this video,

206
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:28,750
the Mark I Nirvash
emerged from a pillar of light.

207
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:31,333
Just like the Scub Corals
and Secrets do.

208
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:33,958
In other words, it
came from another world.

209
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:34,750
Another world?

210
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:35,958
Really?

211
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:37,000
Where is it?

212
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:38,708
Well, according to Johansson--

213
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:41,166
You mean that
unscientific drivel?

214
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:44,750
And my, where is my mother now?

215
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:46,708
We explained it to you before.

216
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:48,875
She disappeared ten years ago.

217
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:50,333
Why are you hiding it?

218
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:52,458
After the Scub Burst
off the coast of Okinawa,

219
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:56,000
the Nirvash was recovered, but
there was no trace of its pilot.

220
00:12:58,208 --> 00:12:59,541
It's pretty clear.

221
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:02,250
Most likely, the woman
Eureka is no longer...

222
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,916
Getting back to our situation:

223
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
there are almost no
Trapars in space.

224
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:12,291
Ao won't have
his usual advantage.

225
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,333
It would be too
dangerous to have him

226
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:15,708
participate in this mission.

227
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:17,875
As I have been proposing
for some time now,

228
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:19,625
he should remain here
aboard the Proteus

229
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:21,750
under investigative custody.

230
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:22,958
You could have
handled this mission

231
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:24,375
perfectly well without us.

232
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:27,041
You sent for Pied Piper
because you wanted to abduct Ao!

233
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:28,375
Abduct?

234
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:30,625
What do you call what you
people have done to him?

235
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:31,875
What I want to do is keep Ao

236
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:34,666
out of active
combat from now on.

237
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:38,125
It's possible he's being forced
to fight against his own kind.

238
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:39,666
I don't know, Ch--

239
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,208
I mean, Mom.

240
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:46,541
If you stay here, you'll be
just like one of my kids, okay?

241
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,750
Thanks, but I'm going.

242
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:51,333
You're what?

243
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:54,291
I'll prove that
I'm still a good pilot.

244
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:01,958
Okay, I'll take
care of navigation.

245
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:03,708
This time around, you're
just the Rocket Punch

246
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:05,791
that flies straight
and hits hard!

247
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:06,750
You guys are great.

248
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:08,583
Thanks a lot.

249
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:16,166
The Kyrie and the Alleluia will
divert the Secret's attack.

250
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:19,166
While they do, the Nirvash
will charge toward the Secret.

251
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,916
It will destroy the target
at maximum proximity

252
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,041
and then rebound
and change its orbit.

253
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:26,750
If all goes to plan, it will
work something like this.

254
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:29,083
Nirvash collides
with the Scub Coral,

255
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:31,375
causing it to decelerate
and change orbit,

256
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:33,166
allowing a rendezvous
with the Triton.

257
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,291
This is the best we can do

258
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:36,166
with the fuel they
can carry out there.

259
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,708
If he fails to make contact
with the Scub Coral,

260
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:40,375
he'll plummet
back down to Earth.

261
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:43,291
If that happens, I'll do
whatever it takes to save him!

262
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:50,541
I have a visual on the Secret.

263
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:53,125
It is approaching the
Scub at the same velocity

264
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:55,000
as when it first appeared.

265
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:57,416
It has no noticeable
propulsion apparatuses,

266
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,333
so there should be no worries
about it changing its orbit.

267
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:06,791
It is the same in space
as it was underwater.

268
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:09,416
You cannot rely on
Trapars to blind it.

269
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,625
The Secret has
already detected you.

270
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:14,041
Exercise full caution.

271
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:15,583
It looks like a jack-in-the-box.

272
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,708
I'm sending up the
flares to draw its fire.

273
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:25,791
Go ahead!

274
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,875
Igniting Stage Two rockets.

275
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:37,250
Now!

276
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:41,000
Good luck, Ao.

277
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:45,208
Crazy.

278
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:46,291
The islanders were right.

279
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:47,875
I really am an alien.

280
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:50,250
If my mother was,
then I am, too.

281
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:54,333
So tell me, where
do I come from?

282
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,083
Tell me that, Secret!

283
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:12,708
No!

284
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:13,583
Fleur!

285
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:15,541
We're almost out of fuel, also!

286
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:31,625
Please enter the orbit to
make contact with the Scub.

287
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:32,708
I'm trying!

288
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:36,750
All right.

289
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:38,583
First we pick up
Alleluia and Kyrie.

290
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:41,458
Then we adjust our orbit so we
can rendezvous with Nirvash.

291
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:42,125
Hold on!

292
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:43,250
What is this?

293
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:50,583
A railgun?

294
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:52,166
It's a Japanese satellite.

295
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,333
A malfunction?

296
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:54,916
Do they think we're stupid?

297
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:04,625
The situation is
not looking good.

298
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:05,625
What do you mean?

299
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:07,500
The Scub Coral's
orbit has shifted,

300
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,333
and it has begun to descend.

301
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:12,166
The direction of its velocity
matches that of the Nirvash.

302
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:15,166
Still don't understand
what you're saying!

303
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:21,875
My orbit hasn't changed?

304
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,291
It has begun to
descend on roughly

305
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,083
the same orbit as the Nirvash.

306
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:26,541
So, even following
the collision,

307
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:28,625
the Nirvash will
simply decelerate.

308
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:31,291
The orbit of both objects
will remain the same.

309
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:33,000
Drawn by the Earth's gravity,

310
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:35,500
the Nirvash and the
Scub will fall together.

311
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:37,625
This is an elementary
law of physics.

312
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:39,083
No way!

313
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:40,916
Nirvash's descent
remains unchecked.

314
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,750
Ao you need to get
away from the Scub!

315
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:44,416
Hurry!

316
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,708
He'll crash.

317
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:48,458
I wonder, Ao.

318
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:50,583
Do you think that I'm kind?

319
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:56,416
We have the
orbit calculated, sir!

320
00:17:58,291 --> 00:17:59,916
As we predicted.

321
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,208
They're falling.

322
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:02,875
The Scub Coral will burn up

323
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:04,875
as it passes through
the atmosphere.

324
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,250
Fortunately, at least,

325
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:08,208
there are no satellites
in collision orbits with it,

326
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:10,041
so it will produce no debris.

327
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:11,041
However...

328
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:12,458
The Nirvash won't be able

329
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:14,416
to endure the
temperature of reentry.

330
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,625
It will burn up, as well.

331
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:18,083
We can't let that happen!

332
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:19,583
Do something, Dad!

333
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:20,958
Stay put!

334
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:23,583
The Triton will pick you up
in a matter of minutes.

335
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:25,916
There's nothing you
and Elena can do now.

336
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,916
Abandon him?

337
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:27,625
Why?

338
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:29,083
Because he's an alien?

339
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:31,541
Fleur!

340
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:38,583
I'm sorry.

341
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:40,708
I knew it would be
too much for him.

342
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:42,041
It's not your fault, Mom.

343
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:44,000
Listen, once you
enter the stratosphere,

344
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:45,458
there will be Trapars.

345
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,208
You may be able to use them
to slow down your descent.

346
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:50,250
I could be burnt
to ashes before then!

347
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:51,166
Don't give up!

348
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,083
You hear me?

349
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:54,750
My mom's already gone, anyway.

350
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:56,250
I don't care how nice she is.

351
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:59,083
Hannah is not my mother.

352
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:00,541
You never told me the truth!

353
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:02,166
What's done is done!

354
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,708
I refuse to let any
of you kids die!

355
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:08,708
I'll save you even if I have to
burn up the Triton up to do it!

356
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:09,500
I'm coming!

357
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:11,041
Wait for me!

358
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:14,833
Okay.

359
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:16,458
I'm waiting.

360
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:23,416
Ao!

361
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:41,708
Get inside Ao!

362
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:44,041
Go as far as you can!

363
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,083
What's that?

364
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:17,750
It's a ship!

365
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,875
Are you telling me
to use it as a board?

366
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:35,833
It's time to fly.

367
00:22:24,291 --> 00:22:25,375
Hello.

368
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:28,083
My name is Eureka;
It's nice to meet you.

369
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:31,166
Oh, hey, your hair?

370
00:22:32,208 --> 00:22:34,125
It's, you.

371
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:37,791
To be continued.

372
00:24:12,875 --> 00:24:15,708
Next time on Eureka Seven AO.

373
00:24:15,791 --> 00:24:17,958
In an unexpected
reunion aboard the Gekko,

374
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:20,000
Ao struggles to
reconcile the alien woman

375
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:22,125
with the mother
he lost long ago.

376
00:24:22,208 --> 00:24:24,750
It becomes apparent that Eureka
has brought with her a truth

377
00:24:24,833 --> 00:24:27,375
that will shock the very
foundations of the world.

378
00:24:28,708 --> 00:24:33,458
Eureka Seven AO, Episode 13:
"moonlight ship."

379
00:24:33,541 --> 00:24:36,375
Hear the cry of the
children of the stars.
