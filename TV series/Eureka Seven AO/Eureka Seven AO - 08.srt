1
00:02:00,416 --> 00:02:01,416
Things are finally getting back

2
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,958
to normal around here,
I'm glad to say.

3
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:09,791
Oh, for the love of--!

4
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:32,541
Look, I don't
like the guy either.

5
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:34,500
But it's not our
job to catch him.

6
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:37,625
The IFO teams have a very
clear mission objective.

7
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:40,125
Take out the Secrets
before they detonate.

8
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:44,166
We don't have the resources to
be taking on extra work, kid.

9
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,041
Now, now.

10
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:55,250
I'm sure he feels
bad enough as it is.

11
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:58,916
So, what do you think his
punishment should be?

12
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,791
There's no precedent
for what he did,

13
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:03,041
but the severity of
this can't be ignored.

14
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:05,041
You already gave him
a stern talking-to.

15
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:05,875
That should suffice.

16
00:03:05,958 --> 00:03:07,166
Are you serious?

17
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,958
Your thoughts Ivica,
do you agree with her?

18
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:14,333
We should keep in mind the
situation with Team Goldilocks.

19
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:15,291
Let's put this to bed, then.

20
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:16,375
What?

21
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,166
I trust you, Ao.

22
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,916
I know you're gonna
do the right thing.

23
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,375
Okay?

24
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:22,958
I shouldn't be telling you this,

25
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:26,375
but, you pilots are more like
my children than my employees.

26
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:31,041
And like any father worth his
salt, I believe in my kids.

27
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:34,583
I wouldn't know, sir.

28
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:40,541
How dare you say those
things to him, Dad!

29
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:50,416
Huh?

30
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:53,750
Is that guy a creeper or what!

31
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:54,958
Yeah!

32
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:30,041
Hey, Ao!

33
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:37,083
Doing some shopping?

34
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:38,333
Yeah.

35
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:43,583
Sweetheart!

36
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:45,291
Yeah, you in the apron!

37
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:49,000
Let's see if the coffee's
as hot as the barista!

38
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:52,541
Why're you guys
trying to follow me?

39
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:54,500
Oh give it a rest, Gazelle!

40
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:56,000
I'm not blind!

41
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:57,083
As if!

42
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:58,875
Why would I follow
such a pipsqueak?

43
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:00,250
Listen to me!

44
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,958
You guys seriously need
to stop following me around!

45
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:13,041
Ao's tough-guy routine
could use a little work.

46
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:15,125
If you're trying to keep
track of his whereabouts,

47
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:16,416
you and your friends
are approaching it

48
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,666
with all the subtlety of
a bull in a china shop.

49
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,625
Well, maybe we were
told not to be subtle.

50
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:25,958
You're being obvious about it,

51
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:28,083
to try and put
the squeeze on him!

52
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:31,541
If you're just following orders,

53
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:33,791
someone must have issued them.

54
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,708
It was the president, wasn't it?

55
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:38,333
Speaking of, what's
with all the static

56
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:41,000
between you and
your old man, huh?

57
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:45,666
Just like Ao.

58
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:49,666
He's in the same
boat with his old man.

59
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,625
We have a formal
request for intervention.

60
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:20,458
Mobilize at once, Ivica!

61
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:22,208
Consider it done, sir!

62
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:25,000
Faisal Arabia, huh?

63
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:28,708
As if that country weren't
embroiled in enough drama.

64
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:31,375
Mr. Blanc, you have a
call from the Allied Forces.

65
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,958
Speak of the devil,
and he shall appear.

66
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:35,125
Transfer the call.

67
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:37,250
I'll take it in my office.

68
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:45,416
That was one hell
of a hit your team

69
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,750
took in Columbia, eh Christophe?

70
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:50,041
And that attack on
your headquarters.

71
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:51,291
You've had it rough.

72
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:54,166
I appreciate your
concern, Mr. Secretary.

73
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,416
You'll forgive my saying

74
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,250
that Generation Bleu's
giving me a migraine.

75
00:06:58,333 --> 00:06:59,958
I'm afraid I don't follow.

76
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:02,500
See, it's that damnable
Nirvash of yours.

77
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:04,583
Some of our congressmen
have latched onto the idea

78
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:06,833
that it's the Mark I,
which was in our custody

79
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:10,458
up until recently when it
disappeared without a trace.

80
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:12,000
Really?

81
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:13,708
Yes, really.

82
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:15,208
They're going to take
their case to the media

83
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:17,708
and lean on the President
until they get results.

84
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:20,833
It's an election year, so expect
the full dog-and-pony show.

85
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:22,541
Ain't that a bear.

86
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:25,208
Fortunately, our
Nirvash and your Mark I

87
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:27,250
are two utterly
different crafts.

88
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:29,708
Yes, but of course.

89
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:33,250
That said, if Generation Bleu
could do us a bit of a favor,

90
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:36,500
we'd be much more
inclined to stand down.

91
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:38,500
Faisal Arabia's the favor.

92
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:41,208
I assume?

93
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,041
The Secret is still a ways out.

94
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:53,750
Will retrieving the
Quartz be a priority?

95
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:56,125
And if the Secret should
suddenly hit the gas?

96
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:57,541
What're you going to do then?

97
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:59,208
I would just--

98
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:02,791
Once a Secret has manifested
in Earth's airspace,

99
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:06,750
you know that there's only
one proper course of action.

100
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:07,541
Huh?

101
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:08,750
What're you trying to say?

102
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:10,000
Those guys followed
me because the president

103
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:11,958
of Generation Bleu
put them up to it?

104
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:13,541
More or less.

105
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:14,791
What the heck?

106
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:16,166
And after all that
bull he spouted

107
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,708
about trusting me like
I was his own kid?

108
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:20,083
Where does he get
off saying that stuff

109
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,625
and then treating me this way?!

110
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:23,333
Having him feed you
that line is a rite

111
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:25,958
of passage around here.

112
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:27,583
"And like any father
worth his salt,

113
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:30,833
I believe in my kids."

114
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:33,291
Saying that in front of his own
daughter takes a lot of nerve.

115
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:35,083
Huh? His who?

116
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:35,958
Wait up!

117
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:37,083
Did we really never tell you?

118
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:38,500
Huh?

119
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:41,166
Miss Fleur here is our
company president's daughter.

120
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:44,166
What?

121
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:45,458
Enough idle chatter!

122
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:49,666
Georg has managed
to identify the Secret.

123
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,250
Indeed.

124
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:54,000
This Secret matches descriptions
of an unidentified flying object

125
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:59,541
that appeared in the skies
over Philadelphia in 1752.

126
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:01,458
According to historians,
its appearance

127
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,416
was accompanied by a
series of lightning strikes

128
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,333
that damaged the
surrounding area.

129
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:08,333
An interesting
phenomenon, lightning.

130
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:10,750
It occurs when a difference
in electric potential arises

131
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:13,625
in a space that exceeds the
dielectric strength--

132
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:15,875
Bring the Triton to base ASAP.

133
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:17,875
We're aborting the mission,
effective immediately.

134
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:20,083
Is this your idea of a joke?

135
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:21,416
Blanc just pulled the plug.

136
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,083
What, this is Blanc's doing?

137
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:24,833
But that Secret
is still out there!

138
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:26,125
Turn her around.

139
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:27,041
What do you mean?

140
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:27,916
Come on, Chief!

141
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,875
We're giving up, just like that?

142
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:30,916
What the hell!

143
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,833
Bringing her back to base.

144
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:49,458
Here's the game plan.

145
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:54,458
They made some kind
of backroom deal.

146
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:56,500
That's the only
reason I can think of.

147
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:58,458
And the only group
who can put the screws

148
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:00,458
to GB's president like that

149
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:03,333
is the government
of the United States.

150
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:05,500
Why would America do that?

151
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:09,083
The location of our current
Scub, Faisal Arabia,

152
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:10,916
is the most
anti-American country

153
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,500
in all of the Middle East.

154
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:15,208
The U.S. believes it to engage
in state-sponsored terrorism,

155
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:17,416
and tensions between the
two countries could erupt

156
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:21,000
into full-scale war
without much provocation.

157
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:22,875
Faisal Arabia's
thoroughly anti-U.S.

158
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:24,291
sentiments grew out of a schism

159
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:26,958
among the royals of the
former Saudi Arabia--

160
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:30,583
If the Secret is allowed to
make contact with the Scub,

161
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:33,375
the explosion will deal a
crippling blow to the country.

162
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:36,375
Plus it will deprive them of the
chance at their own coral plant.

163
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:37,083
That's why.

164
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:38,250
He's playing politics?

165
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:39,416
People could die!

166
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,666
Why is Blanc
rolling over on this?

167
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,375
Because they offered
him something, Ao.

168
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:45,916
Something worth turning a
blind eye to human suffering.

169
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,291
Just because you don't like
him doesn't mean he's--

170
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:50,875
That's enough.

171
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:53,875
So that's it?

172
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:56,375
Fly back home like
nothing's wrong?

173
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:04,625
I'm not going to sit back
and let these people die!

174
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:24,125
Hey, Fleur!

175
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,375
Are those two together?

176
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:02,541
He's my father, but I hate him.

177
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,666
You hate your
father too, don't you?

178
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:08,125
Gazelle mentioned it back at HQ.

179
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:11,625
I guess that's something
you and I share.

180
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:12,666
I don't get it.

181
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:13,541
Huh?

182
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:15,208
I mean, if you hate him so much,

183
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:18,500
why did you work
for his company?

184
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:24,458
Five years ago, my maman
and I were involved

185
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:27,666
in a really
horrible car accident.

186
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,250
There were only
enough viable organs

187
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:34,041
left between us
to save one of us.

188
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:37,041
Me or my beautiful maman.

189
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:40,916
When the doctors told
my father, he picked me.

190
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,166
And let her die on the table.

191
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:47,875
I loved her more than
I can put into words.

192
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:49,708
If I had died,
that wonderful woman

193
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,666
would still be
alive and well today.

194
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,208
Huh, but?

195
00:12:57,583 --> 00:12:58,791
I hate him!

196
00:12:58,875 --> 00:12:59,833
I hate him for killing her

197
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:03,041
and leaving me
with all the guilt!

198
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:04,625
That's why I fly
for the company.

199
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:07,958
Because it forces my father
to send me into harm's way.

200
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:17,625
Chief?

201
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:23,958
...bring you this footage

202
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:26,291
of the destruction
within Faisal Arabia.

203
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:27,333
We're looking at video shot

204
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:29,333
in the old capital
city of Abuha,

205
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:32,625
which bore the brunt of the
G-Monster's initial attack.

206
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:33,625
Thanks in large part
to this footage...

207
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:35,083
You ready to do some flying?

208
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:36,250
Huh?

209
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:38,000
That video struck a nerve.

210
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:39,583
Now that it's out there.

211
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:42,458
Folks are saying this country
needs all the help it can get.

212
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:43,625
And not wanting
to look like jerks,

213
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:45,833
the Allied Forces
had to get on board.

214
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:47,208
And that means!

215
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:49,375
It means the order to return
to base has been nixed.

216
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:51,666
We're going to
take that Secret out!

217
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:02,083
I'm not letting those bastards
get their way, not this time!

218
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:04,583
America and your dad are just
going to have to deal with it!

219
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:06,916
Sucks to be you today, Dad!

220
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:21,333
Okay, Fleur!

221
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:23,583
We've got even more reason
than usual to succeed!

222
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:26,583
You can say that again, Ao!

223
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,166
Look how fired up you are!

224
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,291
Time to transform
and combine, huh?

225
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:31,750
Huh?

226
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:36,166
We'll be entering the
ZOA in 180 seconds.

227
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,958
Locking onto target now.

228
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:39,541
Let's see what we're up against.

229
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:42,291
You would be wise to
note that the lightning

230
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:44,166
emanating from this
Secret is caused solely

231
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,666
by the charged particles
it releases into the air.

232
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,375
Since they are
enveloped in trapar,

233
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:50,541
the IFOs are not a
target the Secrets

234
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:52,375
can discern, as per usual.

235
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,833
However, the lightning bolts
are a natural phenomenon

236
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:57,125
independent from the Secret's
will and are capable of hitting

237
00:14:57,208 --> 00:15:00,000
your craft at random,
so proceed with caution.

238
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:02,750
Also, lightning can
form outside the ZOA.

239
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:05,625
Your IFOs are equipped
with electromagnetic shields

240
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:08,166
to guard against precisely
this sort of threat.

241
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,875
That said, a direct
lightning strike may

242
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:12,666
well disable your system
and leave you dead in the air.

243
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,791
Please factor this
into your strategy.

244
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:15,958
Well that's easy for you to say!

245
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:17,666
But how exactly do I do that?

246
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,250
Don't get hit by one.

247
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:22,208
Captain Obvious strikes again.

248
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:25,000
Says the girl who doesn't have
to worry about getting zapped.

249
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:26,666
Ready to get this started?

250
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:34,416
You're out of the
lightning zone.

251
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,416
Good call!

252
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,291
Time to put your guns on, Dante!

253
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:38,375
Here it goes.

254
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:39,583
Fire!

255
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,750
Again!

256
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:01,541
The number of charged particles

257
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:04,166
is increasing by
250% every second.

258
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,208
The discharge zone is
growing exponentially.

259
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:07,041
Damn!

260
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:08,166
Retreat now!

261
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:19,666
No way!

262
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:22,583
Come on, reboot!

263
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:24,125
What's your status, Elena?

264
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:25,375
Are you reading me?

265
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:27,208
Alleluia and Nirvash, maintain
your positions!

266
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:28,041
But Chief!

267
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:29,250
With Elena out of the fight,

268
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:31,166
there's no safe way to engage
that Secret.

269
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,375
Something's
happening to it, Chief!

270
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:47,041
The Secret has released all
of its charged particles

271
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:50,208
with this sudden change of
course to a higher altitude...

272
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:51,791
Seventy-six seconds from now,

273
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:54,500
it will lose all momentum
and plummet to the Earth.

274
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:56,750
Now triangulating the
estimated crash site.

275
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:58,166
Wait, into the coral?

276
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,166
Son of a!

277
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,875
The Secret's going
for a Hail Mary!

278
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:01,958
Abort your attack!

279
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:03,708
You need to get
away from that thing!

280
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:04,541
What?

281
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:05,583
The situation changed!

282
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:07,125
We have no choice!

283
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:08,250
Damn it!

284
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:09,916
We always have a choice!

285
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,250
The bastards win this
if we run away now!

286
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:13,708
I'm sorry,

287
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:15,416
but letting innocent people
die is outta the question!

288
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:17,333
Listen to me!

289
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:19,125
You need to start using
your head out there!

290
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:20,416
But Chief!

291
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:22,041
Fleur, wait!

292
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:23,416
Talk to me!

293
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,625
Get back to the Triton, Fleur!

294
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:26,166
That's an order!

295
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:30,333
Sixty seconds remaining
until fusion explosion.

296
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:42,166
It's heading, for the coral!

297
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,166
Are you nuts!

298
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:47,500
Fleur, you know that
the Alleluia's firepower's

299
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:48,916
not going to cut it!

300
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,875
I'm not going to
stop it with my guns.

301
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:52,125
Huh?

302
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:55,500
Ao, this is one fight
I can't afford to lose.

303
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:58,333
Even if it costs me everything.

304
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:00,458
The Secret is
concluding its ascent

305
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:03,666
at 7,200 feet
over Faisal Arabia.

306
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,708
Its momentum has been expended.

307
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:07,416
Now commencing free-fall.

308
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:12,166
It shouldn't have to.

309
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,208
Fleur, I hate my dad, too.

310
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:16,375
A lot!

311
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:19,291
But it's because of that hatred
that I have to persevere.

312
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:22,041
No matter what happens,
I got to live through it!

313
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:24,958
So I can kick his ass someday!

314
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:28,500
If you hate your father,
you're not allowed to die yet!

315
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:38,916
I guess we're out of time.

316
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,458
Are you ready to do this?

317
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:41,666
Yeah!

318
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,916
The Nirvash and the Alleluia
have latched onto the Secret.

319
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,708
Time until fusion
explosion: 25 seconds.

320
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:24,375
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,
five, four, three, two, one.

321
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:35,500
Georg, what's the
status of the IFOs?

322
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:38,791
The Alleluia and Nirvash are
both still operational.

323
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:41,000
I'm picking up
life-signs from each craft.

324
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:43,416
So I believe the
pilots to be unharmed.

325
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:51,916
Hey Fleur, you okay?

326
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,125
Well...

327
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:58,333
I'm alive!

328
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:02,416
You and me both.

329
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,541
Thank goodness.

330
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:11,833
Hey, where're you guys off to?

331
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:13,208
Reporting in to our dumb boss!

332
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:16,041
We're going to go rub
our victory in his face!

333
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:18,541
I wonder what he's
going to say to us?

334
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:21,250
I bet you the Americans chewed
him out and he's been crying.

335
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:22,458
That would be awesome!

336
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:24,083
I don't even care
if he fires me!

337
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:25,416
This is worth it!

338
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,750
Ow-ow-ow-ow-ow!

339
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:29,166
It's still glued to
my face, you dummy!

340
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:34,958
Man, this prosthetic glue
really does the trick!

341
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:36,083
Hey, guys!

342
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:37,291
Look who the cat dragged in!

343
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:38,541
Ao, down here!

344
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:41,458
Check it out, we look
all war-torn and crap!

345
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:52,958
Huh?

346
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:55,500
Where've I seen those outfits?

347
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:57,208
Huh?

348
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:03,458
I haven't forgotten!

349
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:04,958
The two of you ran
off without permission

350
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:07,125
while we were
docked in Faisal Arabia.

351
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:08,708
Believe you me, kids.

352
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:12,125
You'll have a thorough
debriefing about that.

353
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:15,333
After that Faisal Arabia
footage went live,

354
00:21:15,416 --> 00:21:18,708
a rumor from who knows where
started making the rounds.

355
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:21,291
Apparently, we'd failed to
mobilize a strike team,

356
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:24,083
even though we'd received a
formal request for aid.

357
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:26,125
America had me on the phone
right away.

358
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:29,833
They seemed to think we had
started the rumor ourselves.

359
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:30,666
Really?

360
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:31,958
I told them I had no idea

361
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:34,375
what they were talking
about, of course.

362
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:38,333
Pardon my asking.

363
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:40,000
But why did you
remain in-country

364
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:42,583
after you'd been
ordered to return to base?

365
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:44,500
The engine gave me some grief.

366
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:46,500
Fixing it was a real pain.

367
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:48,458
Ah.

368
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:51,916
Huh? Where are you going?

369
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,583
Someone's got to scold the kids,
don't they?

370
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:58,333
He had Gazelle's
crew fake that footage.

371
00:21:58,416 --> 00:21:59,958
And the whole world bought it.

372
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:01,708
Bastard!

373
00:22:01,791 --> 00:22:04,333
But thanks to him lying,
the mission was a-go.

374
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:09,041
We saved a lot of lives we
wouldn't have been able to.

375
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:11,083
Hey, Fleur.

376
00:22:11,166 --> 00:22:14,291
I know we won, but did we, win?

377
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:16,541
"We," huh?

378
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:17,916
Well aren't you
getting familiar!

379
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,125
Huh?

380
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:37,958
To be continued!

381
00:24:13,166 --> 00:24:16,083
Next time on Eureka Seven AO.

382
00:24:16,166 --> 00:24:17,333
The young man known as Truth

383
00:24:17,416 --> 00:24:19,458
dredges up a relic
of the past in order

384
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:21,916
to stoke the
fires of revolution.

385
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,416
Something appears in
the water's murky depths.

386
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,250
What will it offer
the young man?

387
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:28,833
And what will be
made clear to the boy?

388
00:24:28,916 --> 00:24:34,125
Eureka Seven AO, Episode 9:
"enemy below."

389
00:24:34,208 --> 00:24:36,166
Hear the cry of the
children of the stars.
