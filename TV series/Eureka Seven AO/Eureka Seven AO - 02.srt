1
00:01:41,666 --> 00:01:45,125
The Secret's distance to the
Scub Coral is four kilometers.

2
00:01:45,208 --> 00:01:46,833
Not long now.

3
00:01:46,916 --> 00:01:49,458
Georg, it's type?

4
00:01:49,541 --> 00:01:51,083
Yes, Miss Halström, ma'am.

5
00:01:51,166 --> 00:01:52,833
We're comparing notes with HQ;

6
00:01:52,916 --> 00:01:54,583
several of its
forms seem similar

7
00:01:54,666 --> 00:01:57,958
to the one that appeared in
South America back in the 1940s.

8
00:01:58,041 --> 00:02:00,583
Unfortunately, as there
are few photographs,

9
00:02:00,666 --> 00:02:02,000
this information is based
mainly on old sketches...

10
00:02:02,083 --> 00:02:04,250
Estimated time of arrival?

11
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:06,333
Eleven minutes, sir.

12
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:10,791
Secret arriving at
Scub Coral in eight minutes.

13
00:02:10,875 --> 00:02:14,000
At which point, a large-scale
Scub Burst will certainly occur.

14
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:15,166
Too late!

15
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,416
We can't wait until
we arrive to launch.

16
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,500
Let us out now!

17
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:21,416
Elena, you heard Fleur.

18
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,625
Do you agree with her?

19
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:23,583
Yeah, sure.

20
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:25,166
I'll go, too.

21
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:25,750
Good!

22
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:27,000
No! What?

23
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:28,208
I still haven't gotten a hold

24
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:30,791
of the Okinawa
Self-Defense force yet.

25
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:31,833
What the hell?

26
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:33,000
It can't be helped.

27
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:34,666
We don't have a
signed contract yet.

28
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,916
Those idiots should know better

29
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,291
than anyone what's
about to happen.

30
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:43,125
I'm not giving it to you!

31
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:44,833
I'm not giving it up!

32
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:46,750
Never, you hear me?

33
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:47,625
I mean it!

34
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:52,958
Never!

35
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:54,916
I guess you'll have
to come with us, then.

36
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,083
Wait, what?

37
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:57,875
It's not like we're
using the confusion

38
00:02:57,958 --> 00:03:00,083
to hustle some little kid.

39
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:02,333
You're island-born, aren't you?

40
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:05,625
Look at everything
that's happened here.

41
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:08,000
You want the chance
to do something about it?

42
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,875
Attention, JAF transport
vessel: you are violating

43
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:17,750
the territorial waters
of United Okinawa.

44
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:21,500
This is a warning!

45
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:23,125
No response.

46
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:24,375
Damn mainlanders.

47
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:26,375
Captain!

48
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:29,875
We've received orders to
meet up with Generation Bleu.

49
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:32,166
You mean that
overblown rescue team?

50
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:35,500
And they want us to just
let the JAF ship go free?

51
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:38,791
The first Scub Burst
we've seen in ten years

52
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:42,791
and it's the same day the JAF
choose to violate our waters.

53
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:48,541
Am I supposed to buy that
it's all a big coincidence?

54
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:50,625
Guess they won't be
bothering with us, yet.

55
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:53,083
Looks like they've
got bigger fish to fry.

56
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,416
What does that matter?

57
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,291
If the Secret makes
contact with the Scub Coral,

58
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:58,750
this area won't be safe.

59
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:00,208
You hear that, men?

60
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:02,666
We're leaving these waters now!

61
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,416
Hey, look at that!

62
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,083
The G-Monster's going away!

63
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:32,416
The key to a military FP?

64
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,958
Yeah, the JAF folks
have been looking for it.

65
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,541
This thing?

66
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:39,708
I figure we can use it to
make them cooperate with us.

67
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:40,500
No way!

68
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:41,750
They are the enemy!

69
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:43,250
If they won't play ball,

70
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:46,333
we'll swipe the FP and drive
the monster away ourselves.

71
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:48,375
Look there.

72
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:49,708
Scub Coral?

73
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,625
That's the first time
I've seen the real thing.

74
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:54,375
Can you believe the size of it?

75
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:56,458
We've got to do
something about it quickly.

76
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:57,333
Huh?

77
00:04:57,416 --> 00:04:58,625
We've got to do something?

78
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:00,666
Remember what the textbooks say?

79
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:03,958
In the wake of a Scub Burst
comes a G-Monster.

80
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:06,291
A monster that
destroys everything!

81
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:12,250
But that special rescue group

82
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:13,541
will take care
of it, won't they.

83
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:15,625
Yeah, and what if those
guys don't show up?

84
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:17,625
I still don't
know what we can do!

85
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:18,958
Me either!

86
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:22,166
But if we do nothing,
then the island is doomed!

87
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,708
That figures.

88
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:29,625
Those JAF bastards
are gone already.

89
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:30,833
We expected that.

90
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:32,625
Well, Han, where to?

91
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:34,250
Just a sec.

92
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:37,208
I used the SDF ships to
extrapolate their movements.

93
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:38,958
Location coming your way now!

94
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:41,541
Got it!

95
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:43,208
Let's go!

96
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:51,333
What's the meaning of this?

97
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:53,375
Secrets are supposed
to target Scub Coral.

98
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:55,625
So why is that
thing coming after us?

99
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:57,250
Yell all you want, I don't know!

100
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:58,291
Captain!

101
00:05:58,375 --> 00:05:59,416
What is it?

102
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,625
There is an unknown
FP approaching us.

103
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:02,333
No.

104
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:03,208
They're back!

105
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:05,208
It's those couriers!

106
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:07,500
Are you crazy?

107
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:10,125
You're going to board a
ship while it's on the move?

108
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:12,250
Its relative speed is too fast!

109
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:12,750
Ha!

110
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:14,041
Not for us.

111
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:16,875
We've got this baby
for just such an occasion.

112
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:19,250
What?

113
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:25,208
Wow!

114
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:27,708
I had no idea you could use
an FP's anchors like that.

115
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:29,708
Cool, huh?

116
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:30,791
Hey.

117
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:31,666
There's something
moving down there,

118
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,791
and it doesn't look friendly.

119
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:39,625
Stop it!

120
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:40,625
What are you doing?

121
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:41,666
They're bringing us the key!

122
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:42,708
Keep your pants on!

123
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:44,541
We're just firing warning shots!

124
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:45,375
The Secret.

125
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:46,916
It's stopping!

126
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,750
What now?

127
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:48,958
Sir, from what we can tell,

128
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:51,708
it appears to be turning
its main gun on us!

129
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:53,291
What?

130
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:54,791
Oh, crap. Oh, crap.

131
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:56,000
Oh, crap!

132
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:56,875
This is bad!

133
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,083
This is bad!

134
00:06:58,166 --> 00:07:00,333
This is very, very,
very, very, very bad!

135
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:13,083
Damn it!

136
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,916
Break the front windshield, kid!

137
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Huh?

138
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:18,083
Just do it!

139
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:20,750
Okay!

140
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:22,333
Now we can see!

141
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:32,791
An FP?

142
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:45,833
Ow, that hurt!

143
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:47,625
Get in! Get in!

144
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:48,333
What?

145
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:50,208
That's the JAF's FP!

146
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:51,583
Get in it!

147
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:52,291
But...

148
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:54,083
Just shut up and do it!

149
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:56,000
You've got the key, remember?

150
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:58,625
If you don't use it,
who's going to?

151
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:08,666
Hey!

152
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:09,958
No way.

153
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:23,541
It's got power!

154
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:27,333
I can do this, I can do this!

155
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:33,708
Okay, the basic
layout's the same.

156
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,000
It'll be fine.

157
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:36,750
I know can do this.

158
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:38,125
I have to...

159
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:40,666
...for the island.

160
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:46,208
Ao.

161
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,625
It's the Aratas!

162
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:00,750
Naru!

163
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:02,750
Here, we've gotcha.

164
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,166
Thank you.

165
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,541
I swear, it's starting to seem

166
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:09,458
like our country can
never catch a break.

167
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,041
I need to hurry
or I won't be able

168
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:17,750
to save myself,
much less the island...

169
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:23,916
Hey, it's synching with the FP?

170
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:44,791
What the?

171
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:49,666
Welcome home...

172
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:54,791
Welcome home?

173
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:57,541
Welcome home, Eureka?

174
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:13,458
This is strange,
it suddenly activated.

175
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:16,375
What's the heck's going on here?

176
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:36,375
Whoa what was that?

177
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:38,083
The Mark I!

178
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,625
He did it!

179
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,833
Look at the kid go!

180
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:47,000
That's great but what
are we supposed to do?

181
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:48,500
Uh.

182
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:50,250
Hey there, need a lift?

183
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:52,458
I'll give you a
really good deal.

184
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:53,333
Jeez!

185
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:56,541
Took you long enough.

186
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:05,666
The Secret's rate of
advance is holding steady.

187
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:09,041
There's been no response
from Okinawa SDF, either.

188
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:11,791
Nothing we can do, huh?

189
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:15,416
Miss Hallström, there appears to
be a bug in the ID code system.

190
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,250
A bug?

191
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:17,791
What kind?

192
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:20,708
Well, the IFO that's rapidly
approaching the Secret appears

193
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:23,583
to have the same identification
code as the Mark I,

194
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:26,125
which was supposedly
expunged last year.

195
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:28,375
What did you say?

196
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:18,458
What, it has arms?

197
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:21,416
Don't tell me,
this thing is an IFO?

198
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:35,416
Okay.

199
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,041
Here we go.
Here we go. Here we go.

200
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:39,750
Here we go.

201
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:00,083
This is so kind.

202
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:02,541
And you haven't
even found Ao, yet.

203
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:03,958
It's not a problem.

204
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:07,291
The boy knows he can find
me at the Central Clinic.

205
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:09,375
I never expected you to help us.

206
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:10,875
I'm a doctor!

207
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:13,708
You're the one who
harbored that woman.

208
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:16,250
The island changed
when she showed up.

209
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:19,958
That woman brought suffering
and misfortune with her.

210
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:22,583
The children of this
island deserve better.

211
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:26,125
And what about the woman's son?

212
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:27,958
He's a child of the island.

213
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:29,333
Right?

214
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:58,875
I have to do something!
I have to do something!

215
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:00,791
But I don't know what to do!

216
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:03,916
Wait, was that?

217
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:08,916
It can't be!

218
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:15,125
Have you come back to us?

219
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:16,750
Or, maybe?

220
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:20,750
Don't leave a single man behind!

221
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:21,625
Hear me?

222
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:24,333
Save every last person!

223
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:26,125
Captain! They're here!

224
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:34,583
About time!

225
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:38,000
You're beyond late,
Generation Bleu bastards!

226
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:38,916
Mark I.

227
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,875
The first IFO in
the whole world.

228
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:43,000
Except, it was
ruled non-functional.

229
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:45,625
So I thought it got
dumped in the Smithsonian.

230
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:47,875
Is there an
Allied pilot flying it?

231
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:50,583
But it's like amateur
hour out there!

232
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:55,291
He's deliberately bringing the
Secret closer to the Scub Coral!

233
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:04,125
The Scub Coral?

234
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:05,958
Oh crap! What am I doing?

235
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:08,500
If that G-monster
destroys the Scub Coral.

236
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:10,750
The island, no!

237
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:21,083
Ao.

238
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:22,958
Don't cry, Ao.

239
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:51,833
It missed?

240
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:52,500
No, wait.

241
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:53,916
I think.

242
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,291
It can't see me!

243
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:57,791
That giant bastard can't see me!

244
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,375
The trapar concentration
is at seventeen.

245
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:02,625
Maybe that's it?

246
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:05,541
At higher readings,
it can't see?

247
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:06,916
All-e-luia here.

248
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,541
The Scub Coral is alive.

249
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:10,250
So far, so good on that front.

250
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:12,250
What's with this trapar storm?

251
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:13,666
Its Third Engine is running.

252
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:14,750
Huh?

253
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:16,125
On the Mark I.

254
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:19,041
None of the researchers
could ever get it working.

255
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:20,541
They never even
knew what it did.

256
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:22,583
Wait, the Third Engine?

257
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:29,625
Impossible!

258
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:31,583
The IFO is up on two feet!

259
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:33,291
It's standing!

260
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:35,333
Feel it! I've got to feel it.

261
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:37,375
Work with the trapar winds!

262
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:54,791
Oh like hell it's lost!

263
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:56,250
Get it back!

264
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:20,208
It was ten years ago

265
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:22,708
that the Mark I was
last confirmed operational.

266
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,791
That was in Okinawa,
prior to independence.

267
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:27,500
The largest Scub Burst
in history occurred...

268
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:33,833
Hey, look at the guy who
was piloting that thing.

269
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:35,166
Yeah, you're right.

270
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,958
He's got blue hair!

271
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:43,125
What was that?

272
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:44,041
IFO.

273
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:45,458
Do you copy?

274
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:48,125
You're not broadcasting
your international call sign.

275
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:50,208
Identify your nationality
and affiliation.

276
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:50,833
No!

277
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:52,250
I repeat.

278
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:54,625
You are not broadcasting
your international call sign.

279
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:58,000
Identify your nationality
and affiliation.

280
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:02,666
Bye-bye!

281
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,083
I'll go after him.

282
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,583
You keep watch since we
haven't collected the Quartz.

283
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:08,083
Try to play nice, Fleur.

284
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:10,708
That's up to him.

285
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:12,416
That was incredible!

286
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,250
I can't believe he
took out the G-Monster.

287
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:16,416
I don't like this at all.

288
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,458
What's wrong?

289
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:18,291
You jealous?

290
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:20,250
Me? No way!

291
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:21,541
It's just.

292
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:22,791
I don't know what,

293
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:25,000
but there's something
I don't like about this.

294
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,083
Oh, come on!

295
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:29,500
Where'd that guy disappear to?

296
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:34,958
What?

297
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:41,208
Oh.

298
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:43,166
Welcome back.

299
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:49,125
You're, I mean that uniform.

300
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:50,333
Yup.

301
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:51,041
You got it.

302
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:52,625
I'm Generation Bleu.

303
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:54,375
Although, rescuing
boys who fall asleep

304
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:57,250
in the ocean isn't usually
part of my job description.

305
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:59,250
Oh.

306
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:01,541
Thank you.

307
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:02,750
So?

308
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:03,875
So what?

309
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:06,333
So, where'd you hide it?
Is it close by?

310
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:15,291
Hide what?

311
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:16,041
Oh.

312
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:18,166
You're playing it cool.

313
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:19,375
Uh, I'm sorry!

314
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,208
Such bad manners.

315
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:22,125
It's nice to meet you.

316
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:23,333
I'm Fleur Blanc.

317
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:27,333
What's your name?

318
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:30,000
I'm Ao Fukai.

319
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:32,416
Oh that's cool, Ao Fukai.

320
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:35,291
Adorable name.

321
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:37,208
Huh, what?

322
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:38,041
Ouch!

323
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:40,833
Hey that hurt!

324
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:42,250
It is him!

325
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:45,041
He's got blue hair, but
that's Fukai's brat for sure.

326
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:46,250
I don't get it.

327
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:49,166
What's Gen Bleu want
with some little kid?

328
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:51,833
Hey you don't think she's
hitting on him, do you?

329
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:53,625
Why would you even think that?

330
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:57,208
Obviously, it's the FP
that they're interested in.

331
00:19:57,833 --> 00:19:59,208
I've seen enough.

332
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:01,208
Let's get out of here, guys.

333
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:03,000
Uh, what?
Where are we going?

334
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:05,250
Well, let's see.

335
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:07,500
How about we go and
do a little caving?

336
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:09,208
It's been a while.

337
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:15,041
It's that kid of yours.

338
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:16,458
The base isn't happy.

339
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:19,000
Your brat was aboard that thing!

340
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:20,666
I know nothing about this.

341
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,333
I thought you
were of this island

342
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:24,708
but maybe I was
wrong, Mr. Niigaki.

343
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:26,541
You know I work
at the base, Fukai.

344
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:30,333
If it helps, you can think
of me as an SDF messenger.

345
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:31,750
Now, where is the boy?

346
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:33,625
I'm about to go look for him.

347
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:35,666
He's just a normal child.

348
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:38,375
This IFO stuff is nonsense!

349
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:39,750
Normal?

350
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:43,500
We have a witness who
says he's got blue hair now.

351
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:05,958
Mama! Mama! Mama!

352
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:08,458
Mama! Mama!

353
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:11,375
I'm so sorry, my Ao.

354
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:16,666
Impossible!

355
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,625
Are you saying it was Ao?

356
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:21,833
The boy operated that thing?

357
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:24,875
Rumor has it the
pilot had blue hair.

358
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:26,500
You think some other
mysterious foreigner

359
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:27,708
turned up out of the blue?

360
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:29,458
Naru! Lie back!

361
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:31,291
So, what do we do?

362
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:34,166
We catch him
before the SDF does.

363
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:36,583
Where'd he get a hold
of an IFO like that?

364
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:37,500
Was it Japan?

365
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:38,625
The Allies?

366
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:41,125
We'll do what we
must to make him talk.

367
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:44,250
Anything to reinforce
our independence.

368
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:48,166
Okay, I'll be right back!

369
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:52,125
Naru?

370
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:54,166
Using the ladies', maybe?

371
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:56,791
Sis said I can't tell you.

372
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:15,000
He's not here, either.

373
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:18,083
That only leaves one place.

374
00:22:29,458 --> 00:22:31,083
Ao.

375
00:22:39,333 --> 00:22:41,833
Dad and them are
looking for you.

376
00:22:41,916 --> 00:22:43,875
So is the SDF.

377
00:22:43,958 --> 00:22:46,208
And that group
called Generation Bleu.

378
00:22:46,291 --> 00:22:48,500
You're a celebrity.

379
00:22:49,833 --> 00:22:52,000
I thought I was
protecting the island.

380
00:22:52,083 --> 00:22:52,833
What?

381
00:22:52,916 --> 00:22:55,541
But maybe I was wrong.

382
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:57,916
Maybe I'm a freak like my mom.

383
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Was it all my fault,
the monster coming here?

384
00:23:01,083 --> 00:23:02,416
Stop that.

385
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,916
Look what's happened to me.

386
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,750
Pretty freaky, huh?

387
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:09,541
Blue hair.

388
00:23:16,458 --> 00:23:18,708
I saw it in my dreams.

389
00:23:18,791 --> 00:23:20,375
You had blue hair

390
00:23:20,458 --> 00:23:23,833
and you were fighting in
the Sea Colossus for me.

391
00:23:23,916 --> 00:23:27,291
Ten years ago, the giant
was protecting me, too.

392
00:23:27,375 --> 00:23:29,583
It was like that.

393
00:23:29,666 --> 00:23:31,791
Thank you.

394
00:23:34,875 --> 00:23:37,875
Hey, Naru.

395
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:40,000
I have something.

396
00:23:52,916 --> 00:23:54,333
Incredible!

397
00:23:54,416 --> 00:23:56,000
That's it?

398
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,541
This, this is yours, Ao.

399
00:24:00,625 --> 00:24:02,791
Your Sea Colossus.

400
00:24:06,958 --> 00:24:08,083
To be continued.

401
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:45,708
Next time on Eureka Seven AO.

402
00:25:45,791 --> 00:25:47,625
When the dust
settles after the storm,

403
00:25:47,708 --> 00:25:49,833
Ao finds more
danger awaiting him.

404
00:25:49,916 --> 00:25:51,125
The boy is captured by those

405
00:25:51,208 --> 00:25:53,916
who cannot lay the
ghosts of the past to rest.

406
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,250
Some fear him,
some want to use him.

407
00:25:56,333 --> 00:25:59,083
But who will come to his aid?

408
00:25:59,166 --> 00:26:04,416
Eureka Seven AO, Episode 3:
"secret operation."

409
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,875
Hear the cry of the
children of the stars.
