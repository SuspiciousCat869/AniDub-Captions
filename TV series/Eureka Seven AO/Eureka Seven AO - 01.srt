1
00:00:27,291 --> 00:00:29,458
Looking for something
up there, Ivica?

2
00:00:29,958 --> 00:00:31,458
I've been waiting
a while, Blanc.

3
00:00:31,541 --> 00:00:33,166
What took you so long?

4
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:33,875
Huh?

5
00:00:33,958 --> 00:00:35,250
Yeah, sorry.

6
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:37,875
I've been stuck dealing
with the local bureaucracy.

7
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:39,166
They've got some nerve,

8
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,791
trying to haggle the
fee this late in the game.

9
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,541
They don't like foreigners.

10
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:44,791
That's ridiculous.

11
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:47,875
We're a private company,
not an invading army.

12
00:00:47,958 --> 00:00:49,166
Besides.

13
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,291
It seems like they need us.

14
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:53,458
The sites always look like this.

15
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:56,208
Urban graveyards
for those left behind.

16
00:00:56,291 --> 00:00:58,333
You're still waiting,
aren't you?

17
00:00:58,416 --> 00:01:01,250
For that blue-haired
girl to come back.

18
00:01:01,333 --> 00:01:04,958
Who else could possibly
put a stop to this misery?

19
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:06,166
Hoping the dead will come back

20
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:08,958
to life won't get you anywhere.

21
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:11,333
We have job to do Ivica.

22
00:01:20,875 --> 00:01:23,458
Do they really have
to fly that low?

23
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:26,916
The next time I see them,
they're going to get an earful!

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,750
Come on, let's go!

25
00:01:28,833 --> 00:01:32,125
Our to-do list just
keeps getting longer.

26
00:01:32,208 --> 00:01:35,541
True, we certainly
can't afford to sit still.

27
00:01:35,625 --> 00:01:37,791
But we can dream.

28
00:01:37,875 --> 00:01:39,875
It's human nature, after all.

29
00:01:39,958 --> 00:01:43,333
We look to the sky,
waiting for hope to return,

30
00:01:43,416 --> 00:01:46,541
as if borne on
the wings of a bird.

31
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:20,000
It was strange.

32
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:22,333
I dreamt that the
world was changing.

33
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:23,875
Changing?

34
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:25,708
What do you mean, by "changing"?

35
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:27,041
I don't really know.

36
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:30,916
I couldn't tell if it was
for better or for worse.

37
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,958
I can't.

38
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:32,791
Naru!

39
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:34,958
Are you having an attack?

40
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:36,041
Forget about me.

41
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:38,166
Just watch where
you're driving, okay?

42
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:40,916
Stupid, useless body.

43
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,458
Jeez.

44
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:49,625
So, this dream.

45
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:52,916
Was it normal, or did it
come from your Yuta powers?

46
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,333
I don't know.

47
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:57,291
So then it might not have
been a precognitive dream

48
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:59,583
and yet you still
want to evacuate Noa?

49
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:01,541
I told you,
there will be a fire.

50
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:03,208
We can't leave her!

51
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:04,708
You do realize she
was just starting

52
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:06,125
to get used to the woods.

53
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:08,666
She has no family
or friends here.

54
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,208
She shouldn't have
to be all alone.

55
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:14,333
You understand.
You know how it feels, Ao.

56
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:19,000
I'm sorry.

57
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:21,375
Are you mad?

58
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:22,625
Behind you.

59
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:25,125
She's over there.

60
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:27,166
Huh?

61
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,083
Noa!

62
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:36,208
What?

63
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:37,666
You're going now?

64
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,458
I don't have a choice.

65
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:42,708
I haven't finished picking
the sea mangos for Mr. Wong.

66
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:44,833
But poaching is poaching, Ao!

67
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:47,750
Let it go and try
to get some rest.

68
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:50,125
You really don't need
to exhaust yourself.

69
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:51,958
Yeah, yeah, I know.

70
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:53,208
Now, come back soon,

71
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:55,750
or I'll have to file a
missing persons report!

72
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:56,916
Honestly.

73
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,416
You can be a real
pain when you want to.

74
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:03,708
You got to admit.

75
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:08,041
A hundred thousand to
transport ECUs for IFOs?

76
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:11,166
Every job should
be like this one.

77
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,416
I don't know, Gazelle.

78
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,416
What?

79
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,375
It's the Japan Armed Forces.

80
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:17,750
You think we can
really trust those guys?

81
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:20,916
Yeah, letting them install a
device we've never seen before.

82
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,708
How do we know
what they're up to?

83
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:24,083
Aw, lay off!

84
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:26,833
We all checked it over
top to bottom, didn't we?

85
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:29,166
It's the latest model
beacon controller.

86
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,625
With the signal from this baby,

87
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:33,458
the JAF can track
and help guide us.

88
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,541
That's what they said.

89
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:37,083
Sounds too good to be true.

90
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:38,625
Must be a catch.

91
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:41,000
If you're not on
board, back out now.

92
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:44,000
I don't mind keeping the
hundred thousand for myself.

93
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:50,416
Gazelle!

94
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:53,583
Hey! What's wrong?

95
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:55,291
Something burning?

96
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:57,166
Its just smoke, not fire.

97
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,708
Looks like my
generator's gone haywire.

98
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:00,750
Hey, Han!

99
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:01,750
I'm going to land!

100
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:02,416
Watch me.

101
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,666
Roger!

102
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:10,333
Crap!

103
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,041
Close one.

104
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:22,333
Ow!

105
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:25,625
Damn you!

106
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:27,500
What? Huh?

107
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:30,083
Moron!

108
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:31,000
What the hell are you doing,

109
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:32,458
jumping in front
of me like that?

110
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:33,708
You're angry?

111
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:35,125
I'm the one who
almost just got killed

112
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:37,291
by your crappy driving!

113
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:38,375
Is that right?

114
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:40,208
You want to say that again, kid?

115
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:41,083
Hold on!

116
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:42,625
Just cool it, Gazelle.

117
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:47,750
Is now really the best time
to be picking a fight with--!

118
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:48,541
Hey, Pippo!

119
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:49,833
Can't you be more careful?

120
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:51,333
I just tripped.

121
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,333
If the goods get damaged,

122
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:55,458
we can kiss that
hundred-thousand goodbye!

123
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:57,333
Come on man lay off.

124
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:58,458
It was an accident.

125
00:06:58,541 --> 00:06:59,791
What is this?

126
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:01,208
Just hurry, will you?

127
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:02,625
If there's a transmitter
on this case,

128
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:05,666
the JAF will think
we're up to something.

129
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:06,625
We don't want that!

130
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:08,958
JAF?

131
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:11,041
Okay. We're done here.

132
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:12,208
Let's go!

133
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:16,416
I swear, kid,
you're one lucky brat.

134
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,375
If we had more time,
I would show you--!

135
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:19,000
It's no good!

136
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:20,291
Eh?

137
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:22,375
I've never seen ECU
trouble like this before.

138
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:23,875
I can't save it.

139
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:26,458
Isn't fixing this
stuff your specialty?

140
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,208
Easy for you to say.

141
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:31,208
You're not seeing
what I'm seeing here.

142
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,041
So, what now?

143
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:35,375
There's not much time.

144
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:36,416
Whoa, hey!

145
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,208
Where are you going?

146
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,791
I know you.

147
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:42,416
You're old man
Fukai's boy, right?

148
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:45,458
Thought so.

149
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:47,458
Could we borrow an
FP from your place?

150
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:49,083
The old man must
have an extra one

151
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:51,041
laying around somewhere, right?

152
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:55,166
I mean, if he's rich enough to
take in some stray foreign kid.

153
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,875
What?

154
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:58,500
Huh?

155
00:07:58,583 --> 00:07:59,708
Han, what's that?

156
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:01,125
I don't know!

157
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:02,708
The ECU! It's--!

158
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:29,041
What are you doing
just standing there?

159
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:29,791
What's your deal?

160
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:30,583
Let go!

161
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:32,000
Come on kid!

162
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:33,666
You learned about these
things in school, didn't you?

163
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,125
You're looking at a Scub Burst!

164
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:37,500
We're not safe here.

165
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:40,000
Get in one of our
FPs and evacuate!

166
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:40,958
Hey!

167
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:42,750
Where are you going?

168
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:43,333
Whatever!

169
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:44,083
Gazelle!

170
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:44,916
What are you guys doing?

171
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,750
We need to get out of here!

172
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:50,708
Hey, this could be bad.

173
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:52,541
I'm talking serious trouble.

174
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:54,750
Serious trouble?

175
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:58,375
I'm starting to think that's
been brewing for a while now.

176
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:08,166
I thought we were all
finished up for the day.

177
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,833
Well we were.

178
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:14,250
But something came up.

179
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:16,583
Why don't you use
one of the other teams?

180
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:18,708
We need to let the kids
have some time to rest!

181
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:21,458
Unfortunately we've picked
up on a Scub Coral reading.

182
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:23,666
We get those all
the time! So what?

183
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,500
This time it's different.

184
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:27,875
The location is rather unique.

185
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:29,500
The Scub Coral outbreak

186
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:32,000
was confirmed thirty
minutes earlier.

187
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:33,541
But as of five minutes ago,

188
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:35,375
it's reading's
been growing rapidly.

189
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:37,666
We're still analyzing
all the data.

190
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:40,250
But as it stands now,
the possibility

191
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:43,750
of a Secret appearing is
at ninety-eight percent.

192
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:48,291
And the anticipated location
of the appearance, is here.

193
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:49,375
Wait, is that?

194
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:50,458
Yes.

195
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:52,541
It's in disputed
territory; fought over

196
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:55,708
by China, Japan,
and United Okinawa.

197
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:57,666
That's a troublesome spot.

198
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,125
Do you get it now?

199
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:02,833
When the request to mobilize
comes, your team's going.

200
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:05,041
Naru!

201
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:07,541
Naru!

202
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:13,458
Whoa!

203
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:14,625
Stay with me!

204
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:16,333
What's going on?

205
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:18,208
Ao, I don't know
what's happening!

206
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:19,750
Calm down, all right!

207
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:32,166
So, that's it?

208
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:35,041
Scub Coral!

209
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:44,500
Come on, let's go!

210
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:45,041
Huh?

211
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:46,083
Time to move!

212
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:47,666
We can use the
commotion as cover.

213
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:50,666
We'll use it to hide our
rendezvous with the JAF!

214
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,375
Unless I miss my guess,

215
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:10,166
that glow is an indication
of a Scub Coral appearance.

216
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,208
What would you like to do?

217
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:14,583
I would suggest
a temporary retreat.

218
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:16,208
No, let's wait.

219
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:17,541
But the danger?

220
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:20,458
I'm well aware of
the risks but Captain.

221
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:22,833
Say we return with
a lifeless giant.

222
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:25,166
That won't make anybody happy.

223
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,958
Let's have a little
faith in the Okinawans.

224
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:30,666
There's nothing to
do but wait, anyway.

225
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:36,583
Hang on back there!

226
00:11:57,916 --> 00:11:59,500
What, that's a...

227
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:14,333
Hey, you okay?

228
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:16,375
Yeah.

229
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:19,291
Where's Noa?

230
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:25,666
Oh, good.

231
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:47,041
Those lights, what in the
world is happening out there?

232
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:49,750
I really have no idea.

233
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:51,500
Naru.

234
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:55,166
I can't say why but for
some reason, I feel sad.

235
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:03,666
I repeat.

236
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,125
Anyone in the Osaki
area of Iwato Island,

237
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:08,833
please evacuate immediately.

238
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:12,750
So, that thing I saw
earlier was a G-Monster.

239
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,541
This is just crazy.

240
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:17,875
How am I going to
explain it to Gramps?

241
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:29,125
You're getting in late.

242
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:31,333
Yeah, I know.

243
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:33,625
I've been called to
the Central Clinic.

244
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:35,083
I'm going.

245
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:38,416
I won't be back until
morning, so don't wait up.

246
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,291
Tomorrow's the
enrollment ceremony.

247
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:42,875
What? Is that it?

248
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:44,416
Eh?

249
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,208
It's not like you're obligated
to look after me anymore.

250
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:49,958
I'm old enough to work
and take care of myself!

251
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:52,541
Don't be ridiculous, Ao.

252
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:54,458
Parents send their
children to school.

253
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:56,458
That is what a guardian does.

254
00:13:56,541 --> 00:14:01,083
Whether or not they're
related by blood.

255
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:02,291
Hey, Gramps!

256
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:03,791
Want to take my FP?

257
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:07,208
An old man has no place
behind the wheel of that thing.

258
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:11,166
Well, I admit we
had some concerns,

259
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,375
given what happened.

260
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:15,083
But we had faith
that you'd manage

261
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:16,791
to pull through for us on this.

262
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:18,166
Damn straight, we did.

263
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:21,500
Unlike mainlanders, we
Okinawans keep our promises.

264
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:25,041
You've got a mouth on you, huh?

265
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:26,791
Excuse me, but we
seem to be missing

266
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:31,541
a piece from inside the case.

267
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:32,583
Oh!

268
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:33,083
Oh!

269
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:33,791
Oh!

270
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:36,541
Oh.

271
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,000
Well, whatever.

272
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:42,875
What the heck?

273
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:45,625
This looks more like
crappy bar food than dinner.

274
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:53,541
All I'm doing different
is wearing a uniform.

275
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:55,291
So, then, why do
I get the feeling

276
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:57,666
this is the end of something?

277
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:06,083
You're on the level?

278
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:07,333
Seriously?

279
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:08,791
The hundred thousand
dollars is still ours,

280
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:11,541
so long as we're
back within six hours?

281
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:13,000
What, do you think we're lying?

282
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:14,666
Guess we'll see.

283
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:16,875
Come on.

284
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,750
You sound totally fine to me.

285
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:20,166
If you were really worried,

286
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,583
you could've stayed to
look after me at my place.

287
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:25,416
Don't give me that.

288
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,791
You know why I didn't stay.

289
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:29,250
Your dad hates me being there.

290
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:30,291
Please.

291
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:33,666
You're always
making excuses, Ao.

292
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,666
Look, I have no idea
what your mother did

293
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:40,416
when she was here but that's got
nothing to do with you, does it?

294
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,416
You're you, not her.

295
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,458
What's the point in worrying
about it all the time?

296
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:47,000
I can't help it.

297
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:50,625
I'm so different from everyone.

298
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:52,500
Give me a break.

299
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:54,958
Yeah, sure, you're
a foreigner and all

300
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:56,875
but at least you're
not deathly ill.

301
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:58,750
Well, of course not, but...

302
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:01,416
So which one of us
is better off, huh?

303
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,416
Naru.

304
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,250
Don't "Naru" me!

305
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:05,125
Never mind.

306
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:06,041
I'm going to bed!

307
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:06,833
Hey wait!

308
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:07,375
Good night!

309
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:08,625
What?

310
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:11,041
Aw, man.

311
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:12,791
She's always bringing
up her illness.

312
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:16,291
How's a guy supposed
to fight against that?

313
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:20,958
Oh, well.

314
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:23,708
Maybe she'll stop being
mad if I give her this.

315
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:31,416
We don't have any
exact information yet,

316
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,166
So, what're we going to do?

317
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:35,916
Far as I can tell,
there's nothing we can do.

318
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,500
Look at the size of that crater.

319
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:40,208
How are we supposed to
find anything on this beach?

320
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:42,541
Hey, you know what?

321
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:44,625
There was that
little brat, remember?

322
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:46,250
Wasn't that Fukai's kid.

323
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:47,000
Yeah!

324
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:48,750
He was here, too.

325
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:49,958
It's a long shot.

326
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:51,958
But he might've picked
it up or something.

327
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:53,625
Think should we check?

328
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:55,458
I've got a bad feeling.

329
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:56,291
Huh?

330
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:57,875
Something's off here.

331
00:16:57,958 --> 00:16:59,166
What do you mean "off"?

332
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,666
We were transporting their goods

333
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:03,833
when the Scub showed
up then a G-Monster

334
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:06,291
and what about the
military FP they had?

335
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:07,291
Okay.

336
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:09,958
So what are you
trying to suggest?

337
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:11,375
We might've gotten
ourselves involved

338
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:13,458
in something real dicey.

339
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:14,750
I'm sure you're wrong.

340
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,541
I hope I am!

341
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:17,625
But come on.

342
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:18,958
Take a good listen.

343
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:20,416
What do you hear?

344
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,666
There's nothing.

345
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,250
Not even birdsong.

346
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:25,875
That's it, that's it!

347
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:27,375
Smile everyone!

348
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:28,875
Hey, sis.

349
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:30,791
Look, What is that thing?

350
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:33,000
What thing?

351
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:38,541
What the?

352
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:40,250
The same as yesterday?

353
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:42,041
You've got to be kidding me!

354
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:43,833
Don't people say that
the Scub never show up

355
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:46,041
in the same place twice?

356
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:47,625
Hey, wait hold on a second!

357
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:48,500
Look!

358
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:51,375
There's more than one pillar.

359
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:52,958
This is why
I strongly recommended

360
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:55,458
that you put in the
request the first time.

361
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:58,833
This turn of events
was rather unexpected.

362
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:01,125
No, it's all right.

363
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:03,000
We deal in the unexpected.

364
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,583
Protecting men
from unknown entities.

365
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:07,291
That's our specialty.

366
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:09,916
We are, Generation Bleu.

367
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,791
Team Pied Piper
will be there shortly.

368
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:14,625
You'll be sending in
your ace team to help us?

369
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:17,583
We're willing to make
an exception this once.

370
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:19,750
And now that we
have that settled.

371
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:22,375
What do you say we have a
little chat about the fee?

372
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:26,125
Mobilizing before the
contract is even signed?

373
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:28,125
What is President
Blanc thinking?

374
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:29,333
Even if we rush,

375
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:30,958
we have no chance of
getting there in time

376
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:32,333
to stop the Secret!

377
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:34,791
You're awfully worked up.

378
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:35,500
You're right.

379
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:36,708
How could I not be?

380
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:38,750
What if something
happens to the children

381
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:41,708
because we mobilized
unnecessarily?

382
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,625
I think the children
who need us right now

383
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:48,333
are the ones who're
living on Iwato Island.

384
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:51,666
Yeah I know that, but still.

385
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,708
No!

386
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:34,041
Oh no Gramps!

387
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:35,333
Naru!

388
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:37,791
We are currently experiencing
a high volume of calls.

389
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:39,458
I can't get through.

390
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:41,041
Maybe?

391
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:43,791
There's no internet!

392
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:44,708
Don't stop!

393
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:45,833
Keep moving!

394
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:46,666
Huh?

395
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:47,416
Hurry!

396
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,083
Run!

397
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:48,750
Run?

398
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:49,791
Run where?

399
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:51,541
Any place that's
away from the Scub!

400
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:53,708
Don't you see that thing?

401
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:56,125
A G-Monster's going
to be here soon!

402
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:57,625
A G-Monster.

403
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:04,625
That's it!

404
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:06,416
The same thing!

405
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:38,166
It's not real, no way!

406
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,500
This can't be happening!

407
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:44,208
Not real!

408
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:45,375
Not happening!

409
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:48,000
That's right.

410
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:49,291
Isn't it, Gramps?

411
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,333
Naru?

412
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,750
Oh, yeah.

413
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:06,333
I didn't get a chance
to give it to her.

414
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:16,875
Bastard!

415
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,583
Damn you!

416
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:26,000
What just happened?

417
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:31,041
Huh, that's strange.

418
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:32,750
Why is it glowing now?

419
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:39,625
Does that say?

420
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:00,708
Mama.

421
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:07,791
Good, we found you.

422
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:10,208
So, you did have
it after all, huh?

423
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:11,625
Foreigner.

424
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:13,541
Come on, kid, hand it over!

425
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:16,708
You shouldn't take
things that aren't yours.

426
00:22:16,791 --> 00:22:18,000
Whoa. Hey!

427
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:20,625
Just let it go!

428
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:22,458
You little bastard!

429
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:23,458
You can't have it!

430
00:22:23,541 --> 00:22:24,750
What?

431
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:26,000
I made a promise!

432
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:27,500
Huh?

433
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:31,666
I don't know what this is
but I'm not giving it to you.

434
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,458
I'm not giving it up!

435
00:22:33,541 --> 00:22:35,208
Never, you hear me?

436
00:22:37,083 --> 00:22:38,833
To be continued!

437
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:14,958
Next time on Eureka Seven AO.

438
00:24:15,041 --> 00:24:19,166
A mysterious object contains
a mother's wishes for her son.

439
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:20,708
Swept onto the battlefield,

440
00:24:20,791 --> 00:24:23,625
Ao has a fateful encounter
with a humanoid weapon.

441
00:24:23,708 --> 00:24:24,833
What will happen to the boy

442
00:24:24,916 --> 00:24:28,625
when he is caught in
a storm of destruction?

443
00:24:28,708 --> 00:24:33,750
Eureka Seven AO, Episode 2:
"AO's cavern."

444
00:24:33,833 --> 00:24:36,000
Hear the cry of the
children of the stars.
