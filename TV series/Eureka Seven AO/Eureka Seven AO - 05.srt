1
00:01:53,416 --> 00:01:54,041
Ooh!

2
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:55,791
That's totally awesome!

3
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:57,708
Sorry, you are?

4
00:01:57,791 --> 00:01:59,333
Elena Peoples.

5
00:01:59,416 --> 00:02:01,541
The color of your
hair is really pretty.

6
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:04,166
Kind of like blue quartz.

7
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,458
Sign a contract with us,

8
00:02:05,541 --> 00:02:08,166
so you can become a
member of Pied Piper, too!

9
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,291
Huh?

10
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:11,500
Don't mind her.

11
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:12,583
She's always like this.

12
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:13,958
You get used to it.

13
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:16,708
I'll be with you as soon
as I finish this video.

14
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:29,375
Oh, wow!

15
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:32,916
That's Generation Bleu
Headquarters?

16
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:35,666
Incredible!

17
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,958
But why's it shaped like that?

18
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:39,166
Nifty, isn't it?

19
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,541
It's made from
all kinds of things

20
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:43,041
that were found in Scub Coral.

21
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,750
This is control.

22
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:02,333
Locking onto aircraft.

23
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:03,250
This is Triton.

24
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:05,416
Aircraft locked in.

25
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,416
Guiding aircraft.

26
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,000
Transfer to Deck Three.

27
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:08,750
Roger that.

28
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:10,583
Connecting all systems.

29
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:11,875
Systems connected.

30
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,833
Starting check on all systems.

31
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:16,166
Confirmed: systems
check started.

32
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,333
Triton systems check complete.

33
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:20,375
Triton shutting down engines.

34
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:22,208
Shutting down now.

35
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:24,500
Transfer to Deck Three complete.

36
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:27,708
All engineers,
begin maintenance work.

37
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:30,958
Again, transfer of Triton
to Deck Three is complete.

38
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:33,500
All engineers,
begin maintenance work.

39
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:53,291
So, are you the
pilot of the Mark I?

40
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:56,791
I'm Alexander Boyle, the
technical director at HQ.

41
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:59,125
I'd like a word with you.

42
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:03,666
I'm so sorry
I wrecked the left arm!

43
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,000
That's fine.

44
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:07,916
I should be able to have
the replacement parts

45
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,458
tuned up in just
under four hours...

46
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:12,833
From what I can see, it has
a tendency to over-steer, yes?

47
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:17,291
Huh? Oh, uh...

48
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:19,791
I'll handle it on my end.

49
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:23,375
Can I get all department
chiefs here, please?

50
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:25,541
Sorry to keep you waiting, Ao.

51
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:26,708
This way!

52
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:29,125
But what about Noa?

53
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:30,916
I've left Rebecka
to handle things.

54
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,416
It'll be fine.

55
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,333
Raising the Triton!

56
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:55,791
So soft and warm!

57
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:57,791
You saved us!

58
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:05,291
Stowaways.

59
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:08,458
Holds on, are you
guys from Okinawa?

60
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:10,041
I would like to speak

61
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:12,875
to whoever's in
charge here, please!

62
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:14,500
Pardon?

63
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:18,583
I would like to talk to
your boss immediately!

64
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,875
All right then.

65
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:38,375
This matches up with the data
Fleur brought back, as well.

66
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:40,291
It's similar,
but there is one spot

67
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:43,125
on his genome map that
differs greatly from ours.

68
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:44,500
Which is?

69
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:45,750
The retina.

70
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:48,166
The part of the eye most
responsible for vision.

71
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,166
His has an abnormality?

72
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:53,291
The range of visible
light may be larger for him.

73
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:54,916
Our eyes cannot
perceive infrared

74
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,708
and ultraviolet light, but
electromagnetic radiation

75
00:05:57,791 --> 00:06:02,250
of that sort may
be visible to him.

76
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:08,166
If so, what does the
world look like to him?

77
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,666
Is it different from
how we see it?

78
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:15,875
I wish I could hear
what they're saying.

79
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:19,625
Nothing irregular.

80
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:22,958
You're the very picture of an
ordinary twelve-year-old boy.

81
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,833
I'm all normal?

82
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:27,541
But what about this crazy hair?

83
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:29,541
It's nothing.

84
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:34,291
Simply an idiosyncrasy,
just like your mother's.

85
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:35,958
Right!

86
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,958
So, want to tell
me about this place?

87
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:43,166
Excuse me?

88
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,750
You should be more respectful.

89
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:47,166
Of course, ma'am.

90
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,250
Much better.

91
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:50,416
This is our Swiss Headquarters.

92
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,250
We have several thousand
employees working here.

93
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:55,333
Right now, we're at the
very top of the tower,

94
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:57,541
where the IFO teams are based.

95
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,833
The structure continues
to sprawl underground, too.

96
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:04,083
All in all, HQ is
about as big as a city.

97
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:10,250
Now, just past here
are the living quarters.

98
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:12,458
We've got a brand
new arrival with us.

99
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:14,583
All right then has
he been issued an ID?

100
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:15,708
Oh!

101
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:17,708
I completely forgot
to ask the chief.

102
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:19,875
You can let it slide,
though, right?

103
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:20,541
Sorry.

104
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:21,375
Rules are rules.

105
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:22,125
Oh, come on!

106
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,666
Our next item.

107
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,208
A strange intruder.

108
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:30,000
This odd trespasser was
sighted on company grounds.

109
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,708
Thought to be a
three-toed sloth,

110
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:33,083
the creature caused
a brief disturbance

111
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:36,166
and then disappeared after
this photo was taken.

112
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,666
I can't let anything
happen to her!

113
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,708
Naru would never forgive me.

114
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:43,958
Hmm.

115
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:45,708
You care about her a lot.

116
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:46,708
So, what is she?

117
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:48,208
Your girlfriend?

118
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:49,583
It's nothing like that.

119
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:51,708
We're friends, that's all.

120
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:53,666
I need to find Noa!

121
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:54,958
Come back!

122
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:57,583
You've come a long way.

123
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:58,833
Welcome.

124
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:00,833
My name is Christophe Blanc.

125
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:03,083
I'm the company president.

126
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:06,125
I'm told you have interesting
information for me.

127
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:08,125
Han.

128
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:13,208
We were filming when one

129
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:16,458
of your IFOs extracted
something from the Scub.

130
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:20,625
The Scub instantly
turned gray and receded.

131
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:21,875
It makes you wonder:

132
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:24,791
what is this world
famous rescue group up to?

133
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:27,291
I bet it isn't common knowledge.

134
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:31,333
Our tasks also
include carrying out

135
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:33,833
scholarly research
on Scub Coral.

136
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:36,125
Nothing mysterious
about that, is there?

137
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:39,083
That's not the interesting part.

138
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:41,250
That glowing stuff
you guys extracted--

139
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:43,625
I've seen something
like it before.

140
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:47,625
See, a similar substance
showed up packed inside my FP.

141
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:50,166
It seemed like the Scub
was making a move for it.

142
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:53,291
And then, right after,
the Burst began.

143
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:55,083
So, I have to ask.

144
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:57,500
Is Generation Bleu really
the charitable organization

145
00:08:57,583 --> 00:09:00,250
the world thinks you are?

146
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,500
I see.

147
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:04,333
Very well.

148
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:06,166
You have my full attention.

149
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,083
No luck!

150
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:19,458
Hey Elena?

151
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:21,041
Where did?

152
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:30,750
So sorry I got distracted.

153
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:33,333
I will look high and
low for your creature.

154
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:34,958
Very believable.

155
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:35,708
Ooh!

156
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:37,583
Is that a sloth?

157
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:44,083
Where'd you come
from little one?

158
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,791
Here, have a snack!

159
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:47,875
Look at that!

160
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:49,250
I think she likes it!

161
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:50,500
Hold still.

162
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:52,250
All that fur!

163
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:53,625
Aww!

164
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:55,083
Huh?

165
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:56,500
Is something wrong?

166
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:57,708
What are you doing, Maev?

167
00:09:57,791 --> 00:09:59,708
It's just a little fur!

168
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:01,000
Hush, Chloe.

169
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:02,875
Hold real still, Maggie!

170
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,791
Goldilocks.

171
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:16,125
They're another
IFO team, just like us.

172
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:18,375
They've got a different
vibe going, though.

173
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:36,458
Hey, where's the Okinawan
kid who was with you?

174
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,250
Look! She's Pied Piper!

175
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:42,541
Rebecka, who are these guys?

176
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:45,708
They're uh, stowaways.

177
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:46,750
What?

178
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:48,625
Did you have to
put it like that?

179
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:51,125
Well, see you later, Fleur.

180
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:53,000
Bye!

181
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:04,791
Stowaways... Huh?

182
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:12,791
So, Rebecka, last name?

183
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:14,875
Why should I tell you that?

184
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:17,791
Well we're gonna be
colleagues, aren't we?

185
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:20,666
The president's gone
too far this time.

186
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:33,041
What's wrong?

187
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,708
A Scub Burst, most likely.

188
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,500
Oh yeah, I heard about you!

189
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:00,666
Ao Fukai.

190
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:01,958
Is it true, then?

191
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:04,041
You beat a Secret
inside the ZOA?

192
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:06,541
No way!

193
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:10,500
Didn't you know, Sis?

194
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:12,625
They say he got
the Mark I working.

195
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:14,041
Seriously?

196
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:17,083
Wow, I thought that thing
was out of commission.

197
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,416
None for you.

198
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,375
All of it is for Chloe.

199
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:25,458
You can eat all of that?

200
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:26,916
But, you?

201
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:33,333
She was about to pout and say,

202
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:35,041
"Don't tell me I'm too little."

203
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:36,625
Was not!

204
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:38,125
You may be the ace team,

205
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:41,416
but that doesn't change the
fact that we have seniority!

206
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,583
Hold still!

207
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:44,416
You got some on your nose.

208
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:55,708
Anyway, it's nice to meet you.

209
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:58,458
I'm sure you'll have
questions about company life.

210
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:00,250
Feel free to ask anything.

211
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:02,375
 I'll do that, thanks.

212
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:03,666
Your sloth is sweet.

213
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,166
But we've got somebody
even sweeter here!

214
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,708
Jolly old Bruno!

215
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:09,416
Yah!

216
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,625
Hey!

217
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:16,208
No hugs for Pied Piper!

218
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:18,375
It's not like I asked for this.

219
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:21,875
Welcome to the Generation
Bleu headquarters!

220
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:23,125
Now, son.

221
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:26,000
Turn around and go back
home as soon as you can.

222
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:27,916
If you stay here you're
sure to bring sorrow

223
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,875
to the people you care
most about in this world.

224
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:32,875
Well, then!

225
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:35,166
Shall we go?

226
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:42,000
What's going on?

227
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:43,958
Is their team being mobilized?

228
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:45,208
What do we do?

229
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:46,833
For now we don't do anything.

230
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:48,250
Why?

231
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:50,666
Because the orders were
only for Goldilocks, that's why.

232
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,500
Not for Pied Piper.

233
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:57,416
It's huge.

234
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,000
Any sign of a G-Monster?

235
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:00,750
They're called "Secrets."

236
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:02,750
And no, none so far.

237
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:04,833
However, there is a
medium-sized hurricane

238
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:06,708
closing in on the location.

239
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:08,583
A typhoon, huh?

240
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,000
It's you boys!

241
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:13,000
Have you not met?

242
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:14,083
These gentlemen are going to be

243
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:16,541
joining us here at
Generation Bleu.

244
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:17,541
I'm Gazelle.

245
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:20,666
These two here
are Pippo and Han.

246
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:23,291
It's our duty as
leaders in society, right?

247
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:25,750
Providing opportunity
for the young.

248
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:28,125
I don not condone
indiscriminately

249
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:30,250
involving civilians like this.

250
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:33,458
The Medon has now entered
a suborbital flight path.

251
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:52,750
Okay, we're here.

252
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:55,208
Wouldn't this have been easier
if I'd gotten my ID first?

253
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:56,041
Oh, quit worrying!

254
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:57,583
It's fine!

255
00:14:57,666 --> 00:15:00,083
It's time for a nice,
relaxing shower!

256
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:14,958
You got to love fan service!

257
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:48,666
Noa, he said I was
going to hurt people.

258
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,375
People I love.

259
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:51,458
Why?

260
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:53,458
Why are you here?

261
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:56,250
Jeez, this is a women's dorm.

262
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:57,625
Oh, I, uh!

263
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:58,541
Elena!

264
00:15:58,625 --> 00:15:59,750
Really!

265
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:03,166
I thought I told you
to be more respectful!

266
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:06,083
Tell me Ao, what is
it you came here to do?

267
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:12,791
I'm sorry, but it...
it's just, well...

268
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:19,666
And the Secret?

269
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:20,916
Negative.

270
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,375
We have yet to receive
word of its appearance.

271
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:25,416
Cases like this
are exceedingly rare.

272
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,333
According to the records--

273
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:30,166
Let's see, there's Tashkent
in nineteen fifty-two.

274
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,208
Then Quebec in sixty-seven.

275
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:35,000
And the Strait of Malacca
in nineteen ninety-five.

276
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:36,333
There are plenty of instances

277
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:38,750
where it took some time
for the Secret to appear.

278
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:40,791
So don't let your guards down!

279
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:44,250
If that's the case, why don't
we just collect the Quartz now?

280
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:47,458
Chloe, girls!

281
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:50,041
I don't want you
getting too far ahead!

282
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:51,083
Don't worry.

283
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:53,416
We know how to handle it.

284
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,500
We'll make sure
she stays close by.

285
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:57,000
That's right.

286
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:59,166
Maev and I have a
close eye on Chloe.

287
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,291
Seriously Bruno you can relax.

288
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:02,875
Chloe isn't a child!

289
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:06,250
She may look a little
small for an eleven-year-old.

290
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:08,583
But Chloe's a big girl now!

291
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:12,291
What's that?

292
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:19,000
An Eisenhower?

293
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:21,333
What are the Allied
Forces doing here?

294
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,458
That's a violation of airspace!

295
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:35,041
Maggie!

296
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:36,125
It can't be!

297
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:37,541
A Secret?

298
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:42,583
The Credo?

299
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:43,833
We have her location!

300
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:45,250
No response!

301
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:47,250
Request reinforcements!

302
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:48,708
And do it now!

303
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:53,916
The Secret disguised
itself as a hurricane?

304
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,958
It was spinning quickly
thus kicking up water

305
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:58,541
from the ocean,
interfering with our visual.

306
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:01,875
It's traveling within one
hundred kilometers of the Scub.

307
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:03,958
Off the shore of Point Gallinas.

308
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,625
Stanley.

309
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:11,958
To be safe, team Pied Piper
will prepare to mobilize.

310
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:13,416
You can't be serious!

311
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,791
Our kids just got back!

312
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:19,625
If it was us out there,
we'd have Kyrie standing by

313
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:22,708
above the clouds,
don't you think?

314
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:29,333
So, uh, what should I be doing?

315
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:30,791
Don't know.

316
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:33,291
Are you going to
start flying with us Ao?

317
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:34,541
I thought so.

318
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:36,500
They probably just
wanted the Mark I.

319
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:40,250
It is something our
president would do.

320
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:41,666
Those're fighting words!

321
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:45,250
Come on, we both know
that's how he operates.

322
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:46,625
But, then...

323
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:49,541
what was the point in
coming all this way?

324
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:03,750
Hold on!
Where are you going?

325
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:05,500
I'll ask you again.

326
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:08,541
Just once, what is it
you came here to do?

327
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:25,958
Requiem, Gloria, Credo!

328
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:28,166
Why are none of
them are responding?

329
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,583
Medon come in!

330
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:31,708
We're going to rescue our IFOs!

331
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:33,875
Requesting urgent
reinforcements!

332
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,458
Right!

333
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:39,625
Pied Piper,
move out immediately!

334
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:50,541
Sorry!

335
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:54,375
And where do you
think you're going?

336
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:00,291
This is your uniform.

337
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:02,500
Go on and get changed.

338
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:17,000
Hold on a sec.

339
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:24,833
Hurry.

340
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:26,125
Right.

341
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,666
Take this.

342
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,333
What is it?

343
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:41,791
It's the key to the Nirvash.

344
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:53,416
Excuse me!

345
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,500
The Nirvash is tuned up
and ready to go,

346
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:56,791
including the left arm.

347
00:20:56,875 --> 00:21:00,208
Sorry, but don't people
call it the Mark I?

348
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:02,208
Those are the
president's orders.

349
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:03,458
That's how it's been registered

350
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:06,625
with the company:
As the "Nirvash."

351
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:13,333
You sure there
isn't anything else

352
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:15,125
you should say to the new kid?

353
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:16,708
You mean Ao?

354
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:19,416
He came on board of
his own free will.

355
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,083
There's no need to.

356
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:38,958
Triton.

357
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:41,166
Stand by on hangar deck.

358
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:44,666
Opening catapult gate.

359
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:49,291
Transferring Triton
to catapult deck.

360
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:55,166
Catapult deck, all clear.

361
00:21:57,708 --> 00:21:59,166
Triton set on catapult.

362
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:02,416
Ready to take off.

363
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:04,333
Course is all clear.

364
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:06,458
Control's given
permission for takeoff.

365
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:08,291
Engine output at max.

366
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:10,500
We're ready to take off.

367
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:12,333
Let's launch the Triton!

368
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,250
To be continued!

369
00:24:12,958 --> 00:24:15,708
Next time on Eureka Seven AO.

370
00:24:15,791 --> 00:24:18,000
Still unsure of
where he truly belongs,

371
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:20,375
Ao takes to the
air with Nirvash.

372
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:23,375
On the other side of tragedy,
there may yet be triumph.

373
00:24:23,458 --> 00:24:25,041
And beyond the
light's long reach,

374
00:24:25,125 --> 00:24:27,541
is the shadow of one
who seeks the truth.

375
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:34,083
Eureka Seven AO, Episode 6:
"noblesse oblige."

376
00:24:34,166 --> 00:24:36,583
Hear the cry of the
children of the stars.
