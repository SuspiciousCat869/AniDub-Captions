1
00:01:55,208 --> 00:01:58,041
Currently, eighteen different
Coral plants have reactivated.

2
00:01:58,125 --> 00:02:01,416
That is ninety-five percent
of all the plants on Earth.

3
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,875
Secrets have also
appeared at each location.

4
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:09,333
Even if we counter with
everything we have,

5
00:02:09,416 --> 00:02:11,125
we won't be able to
prevent Scub Bursts

6
00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:13,916
at the majority of the plants.

7
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,291
Therefore, we are announcing
Operation Polaris.

8
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:19,291
What's that?

9
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:21,291
We will launch all of the Quartz

10
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:22,625
that we have previously
stored in space

11
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:24,500
toward the Earth's surface.

12
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:26,375
Essentially,
we're baiting a trap.

13
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:28,125
The Quartz will draw
the Secrets together

14
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:30,916
from their positions
all across the globe.

15
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,666
As the Quartz descends,
it will circle the Earth.

16
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,083
Over thirty-six hours,

17
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:37,583
it will lure each Secret away
from its current target,

18
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:40,375
finally coming to rest
in the North Pole.

19
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:43,458
At that point a fusion
blast will be triggered.

20
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:45,916
And every Secret on Earth...

21
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,375
...will be destroyed.

22
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:48,500
Couldn't we at least split them

23
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:50,708
into a couple
different locations?

24
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:53,041
If we reduce the
magnitude of the explosion.

25
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:55,375
We reduce our
chances of success.

26
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:58,083
I would rather tip the
scale firmly in our favor.

27
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:01,541
Oh, and, Ivica.

28
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:03,500
I have a big favor
to ask of you.

29
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:04,625
What is it?

30
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:06,958
Since you're heading
to South America.

31
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:09,208
Maybe you could get
me some coffee beans?

32
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:10,416
This stuff is pitiful.

33
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,166
It tastes like what
the Americans brew.

34
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:16,208
I know you're about to leave.

35
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:19,458
But you have them right?

36
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:20,958
You're not going to
make it through this

37
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:22,250
without at least some sleep.

38
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:24,583
I know.

39
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:26,875
Is it still bugging you?

40
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:28,125
It's just strange.

41
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,375
We've been fighting the
Secrets for a long time.

42
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:33,666
But now, for some reason,
it feels different.

43
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:36,333
Oh, yeah?

44
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:38,833
Maybe you should
go back to Iwato.

45
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:47,833
Breaking news.

46
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:50,250
The threat of multiple Scub
Bursts looms across the globe.

47
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:52,500
But Christophe Blanc,
CEO of Generation Bleu,

48
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:54,708
believes he has a solution.

49
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:57,750
He has dubbed his company's
plan Operation Polaris.

50
00:03:57,833 --> 00:03:59,250
The US and other countries have

51
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:01,666
thrown their full support
behind the mission.

52
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,458
Can we trust Generation Bleu?

53
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:06,416
They've kept the existence of
this Quartz substance a secret.

54
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,916
So how do they explain that?

55
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,291
The Japanese government states

56
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:11,833
that it is the Secrets
that are mankind's saviors.

57
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:14,708
They urge citizens not to
be fooled by Generation Bleu,

58
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:16,541
and to remain calm during...

59
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:19,375
Very few countries
other than ours

60
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:22,041
have declined to
participate in the operation.

61
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:26,333
Are we supposed to make a
mad dash to join them now?

62
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:29,125
Jump on the bandwagon
with the Allies?

63
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:30,875
I believe this operation
has the potential

64
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:33,041
to change the course of history.

65
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:34,291
We will be freed

66
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:36,375
from the ever-present
threat of Scub Bursts.

67
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:40,166
Maruyama of VOM.

68
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,916
What chance does Generation
Bleu have of succeeding?

69
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,875
If these Scub Bursts
are allowed to occur,

70
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:47,333
the results will be disastrous.

71
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:49,750
Sixty million people
will be directly harmed.

72
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:51,875
Moreover, the Bursts
will cause climate change.

73
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,916
Which will impact another
three hundred million people.

74
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,416
We must fight!

75
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,541
And we must win!

76
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:02,083
I never thought Blanc would do
something as extreme as this.

77
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:03,333
It would have been nice

78
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:05,791
if he'd consulted with
Big Blue World first.

79
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:08,750
He is more than overstepping
his bounds as CEO.

80
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:10,541
I am sincerely sorry.

81
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:12,833
Generation Bleu was
formed as an organization

82
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:14,375
to safeguard the Quartz.

83
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:16,666
Blanc seems to have
forgotten that fact.

84
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:20,333
What's that mean?

85
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:40,708
An IFO!

86
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:41,708
Is it Ao?

87
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:43,375
Everyone, please stay calm.

88
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:45,875
I will eliminate that monster.

89
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:48,291
That's Naru!

90
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,541
Oh, Naru.

91
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:55,333
What's happened to you?

92
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:07,208
Poseidon, prepare for launch.

93
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:25,416
Where are the children?

94
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,375
They're standing by
at their start positions.

95
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:29,208
That much Quartz!

96
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:30,833
It must have been
hidden from detection

97
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:33,333
because its signature
was suppressed.

98
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:34,791
What, Georg?

99
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:35,833
Nothing at all.

100
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:39,791
Well shall we set
things in motion?

101
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:41,041
5 seconds.

102
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:43,958
4,3,2,1!

103
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:45,708
Hey, that was too quick!

104
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:53,291
Commence Polaris, now!

105
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:58,125
What's that?

106
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:00,083
Did anyone else see that light?

107
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:02,458
Yeah, it was launched by
the Poseidon from space.

108
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:05,250
A capsule packed with
Generation Bleu's Quartz.

109
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:22,708
I did it!

110
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:29,333
It missed me!

111
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:30,625
What's going on?

112
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:32,583
Why did it fly off like that?

113
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,416
Damn you, Generation Bleu.

114
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:56,583
It worked.

115
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:02,333
They really are drawn to it.

116
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:04,208
It's like some kind
of Quartz pheromone.

117
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,958
Keep leading the
Secrets toward the Pole.

118
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:09,500
Harry them enough to keep them
from getting to the Quartz.

119
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:11,458
But don't try to
go in for the kill.

120
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:11,875
Roger that!

121
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:15,541
Keep following us Secrets.

122
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:17,541
Ao, come on!

123
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:19,250
Right!

124
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:28,000
I don't understand.

125
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:31,708
They're saying that you
guys aren't the enemy.

126
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:36,375
Is that true?

127
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:37,250
How can it be?

128
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:39,125
We've fought for so long.

129
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,416
What the hell?

130
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,250
Mmm!

131
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:48,833
Very pungent!

132
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:52,208
I knew asking you
was a bad idea!

133
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:55,166
What I wouldn't give
for a shower right now.

134
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:57,416
Morning!

135
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,708
You slept like a log!

136
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:00,958
I was sleeping?

137
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,791
Really?

138
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,000
Just a dream.

139
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:05,416
You didn't wake up

140
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,208
even when Fleur started
doodling on your Mr. Elephant.

141
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:09,458
I did not!

142
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:25,750
It's ready when you are.

143
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:28,958
I'll see you at the next
resupply checkpoint.

144
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:30,291
Thanks.

145
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:39,916
U.S. losses?

146
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,833
Seven of their units
took return fire.

147
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:43,166
But no loss of life.

148
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,125
All right!

149
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,625
Shift change time.

150
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,000
Things are going well.

151
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:51,000
The engineers did all
this away from HQ.

152
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:54,875
And what's more, the Allied
Forces are fighting with us.

153
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:57,333
It's got the same vibe as
a second-to-last episode.

154
00:09:57,416 --> 00:09:59,375
I don't like the sound of that.

155
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,666
I heard a Secret appeared
at the Vesterçlen plant, too.

156
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:06,875
Oh, man.

157
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:08,000
I bet that's got the
sisters pretty worried.

158
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:09,333
Chloe and Maeve?

159
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:10,125
Well, yeah.

160
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:11,291
That's where they grew up.

161
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:12,833
Their parents got
jobs at the Coral plant,

162
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:15,458
so they lived in the area.

163
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:17,166
That's the reason
Chloe's been acclimated

164
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,583
to Trapars since she was a kid.

165
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:20,833
The Secret that was in Norway

166
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:22,833
is following the
Quartz now, too.

167
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:24,208
So let's cut the chatter.

168
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:25,708
Roger.

169
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:30,833
If Chloe and Maeve's
home is being threatened.

170
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:32,666
I wonder how Iwato is?

171
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:36,541
So, you're stuck here,
same as we are.

172
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:37,625
Sucks, doesn't it?

173
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:39,791
This Operation Polaris thing.

174
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:41,208
You think it's
even going to work?

175
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:42,500
Of course it will.

176
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:45,458
It's got the full backing
of the US military.

177
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:46,666
Sorry, Secret.

178
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:49,041
You and your kind are done for.

179
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,958
Our only objective
is eliminating

180
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:53,833
the foreign bodies that
are invading this universe.

181
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:55,000
You are giving us the chance

182
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:57,083
to destroy a large
amount of Core material.

183
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:59,791
That's enough of
your BS explanations.

184
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:01,500
I don't know.

185
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:03,625
It might be telling the truth.

186
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,875
Ma--!

187
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:28,291
I was born from one
of the Scub Corals.

188
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:30,083
And you are my son.

189
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:36,958
You're a child of the Scubs, Ao.

190
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:40,625
And now I have become
one with them as well.

191
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:45,208
Don't you see, Ao?

192
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:46,875
You must protect the Scubs.

193
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:48,500
But my mom told me.

194
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,458
She said Scubs are the enemy!

195
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:53,666
It's time to stop
being such a mama's boy.

196
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,541
Ao! Ao!

197
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:05,666
I didn't mean to!

198
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,125
What are you talking about?

199
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:08,166
It's Goldilocks!

200
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:09,291
They're in trouble!

201
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:14,583
Twelve minutes ago
Soviet ballistic missiles

202
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:16,458
were launched
without any warning.

203
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:19,208
The Soviets are participating
in Polaris, aren't they?

204
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:20,958
Doesn't seem like
it at the moment.

205
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:23,791
Those missiles are headed
straight for the Quartz capsule.

206
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:24,833
The Soviets are saying

207
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:26,375
that somebody
hacked their system.

208
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:28,625
They insist that malware
scrambled their controls

209
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:30,833
and launched the missiles.

210
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,375
It's possible that
Truth is behind this,

211
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:34,708
which is one of the reasons

212
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:37,750
why we've had Goldilocks
and Harlequin on standby.

213
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:48,375
I'm out of ammo!

214
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:49,708
We've got this, Maggie!

215
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,875
Trying to destroy
all that Quartz, huh?

216
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:53,916
Too bad, 'cause we're
not going to let you!

217
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:03,833
The blast from the
missile explosion

218
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:06,000
has shifted the capsule's orbit.

219
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:08,375
Now, it will impact far
south of the North Pole

220
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:10,791
somewhere in northern
Europe, we estimate.

221
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:13,166
We'll need to have the
IFOs support the capsule

222
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,541
and get it to the Pole.

223
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:16,166
That's an insane idea!

224
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:19,708
Alleluia and Kyrie will support
it until we run out of fuel.

225
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:21,708
We'll do what we can.

226
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,916
Then it's up to you and
Nirvash's Third Engine.

227
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,291
Well, the Third Engine runs
on Trapars in the atmosphere.

228
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:30,291
So it uses the
least amount of fuel.

229
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:30,958
See?

230
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:32,291
Where are you going?

231
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:34,291
After the Alleluia and
the Kyrie have taken off,

232
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:36,958
the Triton will go ahead
to the final location.

233
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:37,750
You, too?

234
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:40,833
I'm aware that it's crazy.

235
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:43,541
Uh, what about
the Goldilocks girls?

236
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:46,000
Hey, is that you, rookie?

237
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:47,250
Honestly!

238
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:48,666
Don't you have better
things to do right now

239
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,375
than worry about us?

240
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:52,208
You know you like it.

241
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:53,625
Do not!

242
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:54,625
Take that back!

243
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:55,875
Good luck, Ao.

244
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:58,250
That area's close to our
parents' home in Norway.

245
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:00,333
We're counting on you!

246
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:02,166
Right.

247
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:12,166
We've caught up to it!

248
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:12,708
Okay!

249
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:14,208
Let's do this!

250
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:19,333
There, we've got it.

251
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:20,500
Nice catch!

252
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:23,250
Company!

253
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:25,000
We should've had
enough of a lead on them.

254
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:27,333
Maybe they're laying
on some extra speed

255
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:28,750
now that the
Quartz is off course

256
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:30,791
and getting closer to impact.

257
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:31,708
Can you cover me?

258
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:33,166
Not a problem!

259
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:43,458
No way!

260
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:45,375
You're not going
to take me down!

261
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:58,458
What's Kyrie's status?

262
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:00,083
It's been hit in a
couple of places,

263
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:02,375
but its flight
capabilities are unaffected.

264
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:03,875
The pilot is safe.

265
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:06,833
Elena, I'm sending the Allied
Forces in to retrieve you.

266
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:08,375
Just pull back!

267
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:11,166
The restrictor onboard the
Alleluia has been removed.

268
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,500
Hold on, Fleur!

269
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:14,916
Don't tell me you're
activating the Third Engine!

270
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,833
I can't think of a better time
to try it than now, can you?

271
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:19,291
But it hasn't
worked a single time!

272
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:20,541
I'll make it!

273
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:22,750
Starting Third Engine!

274
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:24,416
Activate!

275
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:34,916
Damn it!

276
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,250
Lost the connection!

277
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,208
I don't get it!

278
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:39,875
Why?

279
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:42,416
Why won't it run?

280
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:47,791
Attention Pied Piper personnel.

281
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:49,333
Plans have changed.

282
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:51,791
Though we have not yet
reached the target destination,

283
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:54,583
we will initiate
the fusion blast.

284
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:55,583
Are you kidding?

285
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:56,583
Listen, Fleur.

286
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:58,041
I want you to dump the Quartz,

287
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:00,833
then get as far
from it as you can.

288
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:03,125
And, yes, that is an order.

289
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:04,583
I've done the calculations.

290
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:06,375
Triggering the fusion
blast at this location

291
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:09,291
will still catch the
majority of the Secrets.

292
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:12,458
We'll bring down Harlequin
to deal with any that survive.

293
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:14,791
What about the civilians?

294
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:18,083
A portion of the Scandinavian
Peninsula will be annihilated.

295
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:20,250
We've sent out an
evacuation order.

296
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:21,791
No, we can't!

297
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:23,166
It's out of our hands.

298
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,958
Wait! What's going on?

299
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:33,291
What is it?

300
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:34,750
The catapult's being
deployed on its own somehow!

301
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:36,250
What the hell?

302
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:38,750
Ao, what kind of crazy stunt
are you planning this time?

303
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:41,375
Nirvash has the only
operational Third Engine!

304
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:42,250
I'm going.

305
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:43,291
You can't stop me!

306
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:44,208
Ao!

307
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:45,666
Permission to sortie granted.

308
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:46,750
Chief, no!

309
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:48,666
But I expect you
to come back to us.

310
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,083
Got it?

311
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:52,541
You are not Eureka.

312
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:53,625
Roger!

313
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:02,208
Oh, no!

314
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:04,625
The manipulator is
about to give out.

315
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:06,875
Proximity warning?

316
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:13,583
Let go!

317
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:14,541
I've got it now!

318
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:15,416
What?

319
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,583
But, Ao?

320
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:18,166
Pick up Elena and
get back to the Triton.

321
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:21,041
Nirvash has a better shot
at this than the Alleluia.

322
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:23,541
I understand.

323
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,833
Get it as far as you can!

324
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:30,166
All right Nirvash!

325
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:33,083
Let's go!

326
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:36,666
The Alleluia's broken away
Nirvash is accelerating.

327
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:37,458
Damn.

328
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:38,958
Ao be careful!

329
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:40,500
The way the Secrets are flying.

330
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:42,541
They're driving you
towards the Vesterçln plant!

331
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:43,708
I know they are!

332
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:46,250
First we'll retrieve
Kyrie and Alleluia.

333
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:49,041
Then we'll back up the Nirvash.

334
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,875
We have arrived in
the designated airspace.

335
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:55,625
However, we failed to gain very
much distance on the Secrets.

336
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:58,083
The chance of this
IFO escaping the fusion blast

337
00:17:58,166 --> 00:18:02,208
is approximately three percent.

338
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:05,833
Ten years ago, my mom
was in this same situation.

339
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:08,291
Before she disappeared.

340
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:10,333
I don't know where
she came from,

341
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:12,083
or where she went.

342
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:16,291
However, I do know that her
blood runs within my veins.

343
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:18,625
And that means I can
do what must be done.

344
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:21,041
I can make this leap!

345
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:23,166
I at least have to try.

346
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:23,833
Okay!

347
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:25,416
Here I go!

348
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:42,916
That glow!

349
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:54,625
What the?

350
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:55,958
What's happening?

351
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:04,125
Ao! What's going on?

352
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:05,708
I have no idea!

353
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:07,458
Help me out Nirvash!

354
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:08,500
What is this?

355
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:09,625
Answer me!

356
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:15,083
It looks like,
some kind of weapon.

357
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:17,583
If that's what it is.

358
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:19,791
Let's fire it up
and save the world!

359
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,250
All the reports so far indicate

360
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:06,083
that there are no
Secrets remaining.

361
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,000
You did well, Ao.

362
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:14,166
Despite the abrupt
change in the plan.

363
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,166
I am curious, though.

364
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,833
Where'd that gun come from?

365
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,916
I really don't know.

366
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,375
I just--

367
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:26,625
Hey, what is that?

368
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:29,083
Oh, that's just
the North Pole Light.

369
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:31,125
Some crazy natural phenomenon.

370
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:33,541
It's been visible
around here for ages.

371
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:35,500
No it hasn't.

372
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:37,791
That light wasn't
there before I fired.

373
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:41,500
We've reached the
Vesterçlen resupply point.

374
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:43,500
The plant's okay.

375
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:45,875
It must be.

376
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:56,333
The Coral plant's all right?

377
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:58,875
I don't think there's ever
been a plant around here.

378
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:02,208
Wait, but?

379
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:05,166
What about Goldilocks?

380
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:09,375
Chloe and the
others are they okay?

381
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:11,208
Um, who is Chloe?

382
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:19,833
I'm going to ask
you one more time, Ao.

383
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:22,166
What is Goldilocks?

384
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:27,041
Like I told you, they're another
of Generation Bleu's IFO teams.

385
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:30,083
This company only
has two IFO teams, Ao.

386
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:32,541
They're called Team Pied
Piper and Team Harlequin.

387
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,625
Pied Piper handles
things here on Earth,

388
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:38,583
and Harlequin is in charge of
operating the space station.

389
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:40,416
You're wrong!

390
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,666
You're acting like I'm crazy!

391
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,291
But they're real!

392
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:46,333
Why are you pretending
they don't exist?

393
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:52,083
Why? Why?

394
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:57,291
See?

395
00:21:57,375 --> 00:21:59,666
Check all you want,
but you won't find anything.

396
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:03,583
This area's been unpopulated
for hundreds of years.

397
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:04,875
You're wrong!

398
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:07,083
Chloe, Maeve, Maggie.

399
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:09,833
I checked the company's
health screening data, too.

400
00:22:09,916 --> 00:22:11,125
Those names you gave me,

401
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:14,083
Chloe and Maeve McCaffrey,
Maggie Kwan.

402
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,000
There's no match
for any of those.

403
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:19,958
They've never even
been registered with Gen. Bleu.

404
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:22,500
Well, try to get some rest.

405
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:24,458
It's probably just exhaustion.

406
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:31,750
What happened?

407
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:33,791
What did I do, Mama?

408
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:35,250
What did I do?

409
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:37,958
To be continued.

410
00:24:13,041 --> 00:24:15,625
Next time on Eureka Seven AO.

411
00:24:15,708 --> 00:24:16,875
The world was saved

412
00:24:16,958 --> 00:24:19,458
by the mysterious weapon
created by the Nirvash.

413
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:21,833
But Ao alone knows the
price of that victory,

414
00:24:21,916 --> 00:24:24,041
and the knowledge
weighs heavily on him.

415
00:24:24,125 --> 00:24:25,416
What will he do?

416
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:28,625
How far is he willing to
go in search of redemption?

417
00:24:28,708 --> 00:24:34,000
Eureka Seven AO, Episode 17:
"Johansson's book."

418
00:24:34,083 --> 00:24:36,458
Hear the cry of the
children of the stars.
