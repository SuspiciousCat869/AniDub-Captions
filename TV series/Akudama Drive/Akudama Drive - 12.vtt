Sister...

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.792 align:middle
Brother. My leg!

00:00:27.875 --> 00:00:32.042 align:middle
[gasps] It looks broken!
What do we do now?

00:00:32.125 --> 00:00:34.875 align:middle
Don't worry.
I'm okay, it's fine.

00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:36.375 align:middle
No, you're not okay!

00:00:36.458 --> 00:00:40.000 align:middle
You won't heal like us,
you're really hurt!

00:00:40.083 --> 00:00:42.458 align:middle
Listen to me, I'm okay.

00:00:42.542 --> 00:00:46.417 align:middle
It's gonna take a lot more
than a broken leg to kill me.

00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:53.750 align:middle
But man, what in
the world happened?

00:01:01.375 --> 00:01:03.833 align:middle

Is that the Shinkansen?

[COURIER]
Luckily my bike's fine.

00:01:13.917 --> 00:01:15.458 align:middle
What kind of dumbass
cares more about

00:01:15.542 --> 00:01:17.625 align:middle
his stupid bike at
a time like this?

00:01:17.708 --> 00:01:21.375 align:middle
Y'know, you've got a
rotten mouth, shithead.

00:01:21.458 --> 00:01:23.833 align:middle
Yeah? Well, right back at'cha.

[BUNNY]
Hey, hey, Sharkie!

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.250 align:middle
There's a lot of
bad things happening.

00:01:36.333 --> 00:01:37.375 align:middle
Do you know why?

00:01:37.458 --> 00:01:38.542 align:middle
[SHARK]
It's because of the people

00:01:38.625 --> 00:01:40.500 align:middle
who opposed Kanto, of course!

00:01:40.583 --> 00:01:41.708 align:middle
[BUNNY]
Uh-huh, uh-huh!

00:01:41.792 --> 00:01:43.292 align:middle
That no good gang
of baddies came

00:01:43.375 --> 00:01:46.292 align:middle
and stole offerings that were
meant to keep Kanto safe!

00:01:46.375 --> 00:01:48.458 align:middle
I can't believe they'd
do such a thing!

00:01:48.542 --> 00:01:50.375 align:middle
[SHARK]
Me neither, it's so mean!

00:01:50.458 --> 00:01:52.458 align:middle
All Kanto wants is harmony!

00:01:52.542 --> 00:01:56.125 align:middle
Super S-Rank Akudama
sure are vile people, huh?

00:01:56.208 --> 00:02:00.250 align:middle
If Kanto falls apart, then
Kansai will be in real trouble!

00:02:00.333 --> 00:02:01.833 align:middle
[BUNNY]
People of Kansai!

00:02:01.917 --> 00:02:04.042 align:middle
The Executioners
are working tirelessly

00:02:04.125 --> 00:02:07.708 align:middle
to eliminate those pesky
Akudama and restore order!

00:02:07.792 --> 00:02:09.375 align:middle
[SHARK] So let's make
sure to support them

00:02:09.458 --> 00:02:11.583 align:middle
while they fight for us all!

00:02:28.417 --> 00:02:30.708 align:middle
[SISTER]
Hang in there, Big Sis.

00:02:36.792 --> 00:02:40.792 align:middle
[BROTHER] It's over.
We can't run anymore.

00:02:40.875 --> 00:02:43.500 align:middle
It's only a matter of
time until we're found.

00:02:43.583 --> 00:02:45.667 align:middle
And once they do
get a hold of us,

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.250 align:middle
they'll kill you two
on the spot.

00:02:48.333 --> 00:02:50.792 align:middle
And we'll be taken
right back to Kanto,

00:02:50.875 --> 00:02:52.417 align:middle
to become its vessels.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.417 align:middle
But Brother...

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.250 align:middle
Hey, stop it!
I made a promise.

00:02:56.333 --> 00:02:59.125 align:middle
I swore I'd help you escape,
no matter what!

00:02:59.208 --> 00:03:03.583 align:middle
Thank you, but you've already
done more than enough.

00:03:03.667 --> 00:03:07.583 align:middle
You took us to Expo Park
and reunited us after.

00:03:07.667 --> 00:03:10.833 align:middle
Don't say that. I protected
you two this far,

00:03:10.917 --> 00:03:12.792 align:middle
so let me keep my promise
all the way through!

00:03:12.875 --> 00:03:14.708 align:middle
Not all promises can be kept.

00:03:14.792 --> 00:03:16.542 align:middle
[SISTER] What do you mean?
Of course they can!

00:03:16.625 --> 00:03:19.333 align:middle
Everyone who's made a
promise has kept it so far!

00:03:19.417 --> 00:03:21.458 align:middle
You protected me
like you said you would.

00:03:21.542 --> 00:03:24.417 align:middle
Big Sis let me see you again,
like she said she would.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.917 align:middle
It only worked because
we didn't give up trying!

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.833 align:middle
I'm sorry, but there's
nothing we can--

00:03:29.917 --> 00:03:32.792 align:middle
[SISTER] Shut up!
Why are you giving up?

00:03:32.875 --> 00:03:36.625 align:middle
Nothing's happened yet!
Big Sis hasn't given up yet!

00:03:36.708 --> 00:03:38.083 align:middle
And we made it here.

00:03:38.167 --> 00:03:41.417 align:middle
We're still not vessels
for Kanto yet!

00:03:49.042 --> 00:03:52.417 align:middle
[SISTER cries]

00:04:06.167 --> 00:04:07.292 align:middle
Move, shithead!

00:04:07.375 --> 00:04:10.208 align:middle
[ORDINARY]
Courier.

00:04:10.292 --> 00:04:15.333 align:middle
This is 500 yen. Please
tell me you'll accept it.

00:04:15.417 --> 00:04:16.792 align:middle
What?

00:04:16.875 --> 00:04:19.333 align:middle
This is all the money I have
left in the entire world.

00:04:19.417 --> 00:04:20.208 align:middle
Take the kids and ru--

00:04:20.292 --> 00:04:21.792 align:middle
I keep on telling you.

00:04:21.875 --> 00:04:23.167 align:middle
Dropped money's
bad luck, remem--?

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.917 align:middle
Bad luck is putting it lightly!

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.958 align:middle
The whole reason that
I became an Akudama

00:04:29.042 --> 00:04:31.792 align:middle
was because I
picked up this coin.

00:04:31.875 --> 00:04:35.167 align:middle
I lived with criminals,
I ended up killing people,

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.958 align:middle
and nearly died who
knows how many times.

00:04:38.042 --> 00:04:40.708 align:middle
I'll never be able
to have a normal life.

00:04:40.792 --> 00:04:43.083 align:middle
Well that's the price
you pay for takin' it.

00:04:43.167 --> 00:04:46.042 align:middle
[ORDINARY scoffs]
Bad luck doesn't even begin

00:04:46.125 --> 00:04:49.667 align:middle
to describe it. It took my
perfectly average life

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.500 align:middle
and made it the absolute worst.

00:04:52.583 --> 00:04:57.125 align:middle
But this single coin has
changed my life like no other.

00:04:57.208 --> 00:04:58.875 align:middle
[gasps]

00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:00.583 align:middle
[ORDINARY]
And I'm giving it to you.

00:05:00.667 --> 00:05:04.208 align:middle
It has the power to change
people's lives in a huge way!

00:05:04.292 --> 00:05:07.250 align:middle
Isn't that worth more than
any amount I could pay you?

00:05:07.333 --> 00:05:09.292 align:middle
It'll change your life.

00:05:09.375 --> 00:05:11.792 align:middle
And it'll change
the kids' lives.

00:05:11.875 --> 00:05:15.417 align:middle
So take the 500 yen
and accept my job.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:16.792 align:middle
Please, Courier!

00:05:16.875 --> 00:05:20.083 align:middle

bring them to Shikoku!

Sure are a selfish one.

00:05:25.833 --> 00:05:27.917 align:middle
I've got no problem with that.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.458 align:middle
Because I decided
to be that way.

00:05:32.542 --> 00:05:34.542 align:middle
Y'damn Akudama.

their way to top always win.

Can't we come back
when there's less dust?

00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:53.167 align:middle
I don't want to get
bronchitis or something.

Relax, you'll get workers' comp.

The Executioners

and I have to stall them
while you get away.

With the shape you're in? How?

00:06:23.125 --> 00:06:26.333 align:middle
Big Sis, no. Hold on,
I'll stay here with you--

[ORDINARY] No! The two

It's what you wanted.

It's something you
both decided to do.

00:06:37.375 --> 00:06:40.917 align:middle
Can you please help me?
I'm just an ordinary person!

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.125 align:middle
An ordinary person?

00:06:42.208 --> 00:06:45.542 align:middle
Could be. I don't recognize her.

Yup. So you gotta see it
through to the end, okay?

00:06:52.917 --> 00:06:57.792 align:middle
No matter what happens.
No matter the cost.

00:06:57.875 --> 00:06:59.542 align:middle
Then we'd be Akudama.

00:06:59.625 --> 00:07:01.000 align:middle
After everything you've done,

you're the biggest
Akudama there are.

We're Akudama?

00:07:08.583 --> 00:07:11.417 align:middle
I'll get their attention.
Try to escape then.

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.500 align:middle
Who the hell do you think I am?

00:07:13.583 --> 00:07:19.042 align:middle

I live right around here!
There was a huge boom...

we should evacuate

[BOSS] How nice of you to come,
Super S-Rank Akudama, Courier.

00:10:14.417 --> 00:10:16.542 align:middle
We're taking back the offerings.

00:10:16.625 --> 00:10:19.792 align:middle
Right after we
kill you, that is.

00:10:29.042 --> 00:10:33.542 align:middle

Prepare for execution.

Get them!

[PUPIL yelling]

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:52.583 align:middle
Why are you doing this? What's
in it for you if they escape?

00:10:52.667 --> 00:10:54.125 align:middle
You're in the way of work.

[EXECUTIONER G]
The kill is all mine!

00:11:10.083 --> 00:11:11.375 align:middle
The offering!

00:11:11.458 --> 00:11:12.208 align:middle
Perfect shot!

[COURIER grunts]

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.042 align:middle
[BOSS] Many sacrifices were
necessary to reach this point,

00:11:25.125 --> 00:11:28.083 align:middle
but it's finally checkmate...

00:11:28.167 --> 00:11:30.500 align:middle

Huh?

00:11:42.917 --> 00:11:44.208 align:middle
Why's a little kid here?

00:11:44.292 --> 00:11:46.125 align:middle
Don't just stand there
and wonder. Move her.

00:11:46.208 --> 00:11:50.625 align:middle
Uh. Right! What are you doing?
You really shouldn't be here--

[PUPIL grunting]

00:11:59.917 --> 00:12:02.750 align:middle
Drop the gun! It might go off!

00:12:02.833 --> 00:12:07.208 align:middle
Why'd do you do it,
why'd you kill my daddy?

00:12:07.292 --> 00:12:11.917 align:middle
And why did you kill my
mommy along with him?

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.958 align:middle
[JUNIOR panting]

00:12:14.042 --> 00:12:15.833 align:middle
Someone call a medic!

00:12:20.042 --> 00:12:22.042 align:middle
[EXECUTIONER F]
What the hell?

00:12:27.375 --> 00:12:30.417 align:middle
What is the meaning of this?

00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:43.958 align:middle
Impossible! Why are
more civilians here?

00:12:44.042 --> 00:12:46.667 align:middle
The hell? Why is this happening?

00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:51.417 align:middle
[GIRL A] My mommy and daddy
were the nicest people ever.

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:55.917 align:middle
They loved me and made me
feel better when I cried.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.750 align:middle
[GIRL 12A]
Why? Why'd you kill them?

00:12:59.833 --> 00:13:04.625 align:middle
And that lady... She said
she was an ordinary person.

00:13:04.708 --> 00:13:07.083 align:middle
Why did you kill her?

00:13:07.167 --> 00:13:08.292 align:middle
What?

00:13:08.375 --> 00:13:11.125 align:middle
I won't let this happen again!

00:13:11.208 --> 00:13:13.333 align:middle
What is it? And why
aren't you here yet?

00:13:13.417 --> 00:13:15.917 align:middle
[EXECUTIONER H] Sorry.
The whole city is going crazy!

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.375 align:middle
The whole city?

00:13:17.458 --> 00:13:19.292 align:middle
[EXECUTIONER E]
Quit your whining already.

00:13:19.375 --> 00:13:23.125 align:middle
[EXECUTIONER D]
And now, you're dead!

00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:25.917 align:middle
[EXECUTIONER E]
Quit your whining already.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.250 align:middle
[BUNNY]
Bad news!

00:13:27.333 --> 00:13:28.958 align:middle
The Executioners
are killing people

00:13:29.042 --> 00:13:30.917 align:middle
who are just ordinary citizens!

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.333 align:middle
[SHARK]
This is a clear abuse of power!

00:13:33.417 --> 00:13:35.417 align:middle
If they'll execute
your everyday civilian,

00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:38.208 align:middle
they might start coming
after the rest of us next!

00:13:38.292 --> 00:13:40.917 align:middle
[BUNNY] If we don't do something
about this injustice,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.167 align:middle
the lives and freedom of
everyone will be in danger!

00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:47.000 align:middle
[SHARK] We've gotta join
together and take a stand!

00:13:47.083 --> 00:13:49.542 align:middle

on every hologram, monitor,

Make it stop!

00:13:53.208 --> 00:13:54.458 align:middle
Don't you think I
would if I could?

00:13:54.542 --> 00:13:56.667 align:middle
Screw this. What the hell?

00:13:56.750 --> 00:14:00.667 align:middle
In this video, we look
like the Akudama.

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:04.292 align:middle
[BROTHER] This is crazy.
Who could have done this?

Was it Big Sis?

happening on my watch!

anything you hear!

[BOSS] Chief? Excellent!
Declare these idiots Akudama!

00:14:28.542 --> 00:14:31.042 align:middle
Do it now and I'll give
them all the death penalty!

00:14:31.125 --> 00:14:33.792 align:middle
I can end this!

00:14:33.875 --> 00:14:36.958 align:middle
That's right, the death penalty.

00:14:37.042 --> 00:14:37.958 align:middle

I'm sorry.

What's wrong?

00:16:26.292 --> 00:16:27.083 align:middle
[COURIER]
Get off.

you'll see Shikoku once you
cross those mountains.

Thank you, Courier.

What's this?

00:17:02.042 --> 00:17:04.750 align:middle
Apparently, a coin
that changes lives.

00:17:04.833 --> 00:17:07.500 align:middle
According to our
shithead, that is.

Oh, come on.

You know, you Akudama
are all really selfish.

00:20:46.125 --> 00:20:47.708 align:middle
We will...
