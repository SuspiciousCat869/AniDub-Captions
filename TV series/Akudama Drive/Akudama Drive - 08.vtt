What's good moral character?

00:06:38.648 --> 00:06:40.817 position:50% align:center
Simply put, it means
I'm a good person.

Though that right eye of yours

for hesitating instead
of killing you

It was very considerate.

I made with Master.

00:11:02.495 --> 00:11:03.955 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR]
So it is you.

00:11:04.039 --> 00:11:06.916 position:50% align:center
I thought I recognized that
ridiculous hair of yours.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:07.792 position:50% align:center
Hi, there.

00:11:07.876 --> 00:11:09.377 position:50% align:center
What are you doin' here?

00:11:09.461 --> 00:11:13.006 position:50% align:center
Doctors have to get their supply
of drugs somewhere, don't they?

00:11:13.089 --> 00:11:16.634 position:50% align:center
Anyway, I'm surprised you
made it out of Expo Park alive.

00:11:16.718 --> 00:11:20.930 position:50% align:center
You haven't heard the news?
You're being hunted.

00:11:21.014 --> 00:11:23.725 position:50% align:center
[squeaks]

00:11:23.808 --> 00:11:25.977 position:50% align:center
Help me out!
I'm beggin' you here!

00:11:26.061 --> 00:11:31.274 position:50% align:center
I just warned you,
didn't I? That's plenty.

00:11:31.358 --> 00:11:34.444 position:50% align:center
Wait, what if I told you
where the kid is?

00:11:34.527 --> 00:11:38.573 position:50% align:center
Cause I know! Isn't that
what you're after?

00:11:43.912 --> 00:11:44.954 position:50% align:center
Thanks for the save.

00:11:45.038 --> 00:11:47.040 position:50% align:center
You better really
know where they are.

00:11:47.123 --> 00:11:48.625 position:50% align:center
If you're lying, you're dead.

00:11:48.708 --> 00:11:53.046 position:50% align:center
[gasps] 'Course I'm not lying!
Look, right here!

00:11:53.129 --> 00:11:55.423 position:50% align:center
One of the kids is at
this marker, guaranteed!

00:11:55.507 --> 00:11:57.425 position:50% align:center
Probably the Brother,
if I had to guess.

00:11:57.509 --> 00:12:00.387 position:50% align:center
I put a tracker on that charm
of his before I gave it back!

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:01.721 position:50% align:center
Was gonna sell
the little shit out

00:12:01.805 --> 00:12:03.682 position:50% align:center
to the Executioners
first chance I got.

00:12:03.765 --> 00:12:07.477 position:50% align:center
The Execution Department already
got him back at Expo Park.

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.729 position:50% align:center
But they shouldn't have
any facilities around here,

00:12:09.813 --> 00:12:13.400 position:50% align:center
to my knowledge. Maybe
you'll come in handy.

00:12:13.483 --> 00:12:15.235 position:50% align:center
Wanna come play
with me for a while?

00:12:15.318 --> 00:12:18.321 position:50% align:center
Nah, I think I'll, uh--

00:12:18.405 --> 00:12:20.573 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR] What, you thought
you could escape me?

00:12:20.657 --> 00:12:22.784 position:50% align:center
Some gremlin like you?

00:12:22.867 --> 00:12:25.787 position:50% align:center
Your hair, your clothes,
your attitude.

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:28.707 position:50% align:center
It's all a front you put on to
make yourself seem important.

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:31.251 position:50% align:center
You lied about killing that
Executioner, too, didn't you?

00:12:31.334 --> 00:12:32.794 position:50% align:center
No! I--

00:12:32.877 --> 00:12:35.171 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR] You're way too
scared to kill someone.

00:12:35.255 --> 00:12:37.549 position:50% align:center
I bet you chickened out.

00:12:37.632 --> 00:12:39.259 position:50% align:center
But if you cooperate with me,

00:12:39.342 --> 00:12:41.720 position:50% align:center
I'll make you into a real man.

00:12:54.899 --> 00:12:57.027 position:50% align:center

Rain, huh?

00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:58.903 position:50% align:center
[SISTER]
It smells funny here.

00:12:58.987 --> 00:13:01.197 position:50% align:center
[ORDINARY] I know, but at

[stomach growls]

00:13:03.074 --> 00:13:06.619 position:50% align:center
What a surprise. Of course I'm
starving at a time like this.

00:13:06.703 --> 00:13:10.290 position:50% align:center
I see a building there.

00:13:10.373 --> 00:13:12.292 position:50% align:center
[ORDINARY]
Should we check it out?

00:13:19.799 --> 00:13:22.385 position:50% align:center
[ORDINARY]
Is anyone here?

00:13:25.972 --> 00:13:27.891 position:50% align:center
Oh, perfect!

00:13:27.974 --> 00:13:30.894 position:50% align:center
Did canned food
always taste this good?

00:13:30.977 --> 00:13:32.937 position:50% align:center
It's delicious!

00:13:45.158 --> 00:13:48.578 position:50% align:center

Oh, man, I am stuffed!

00:13:48.661 --> 00:13:49.829 position:50% align:center

00:13:56.961 --> 00:13:59.172 position:50% align:center
Should we clean ourselves up?

00:14:00.298 --> 00:14:01.966 position:50% align:center
[ORDINARY]
Tell me if it's too cold.

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:03.885 position:50% align:center
[SISTER]
It's fine.

00:14:05.095 --> 00:14:07.430 position:50% align:center
It's your turn, Big Sis.

00:14:08.973 --> 00:14:13.728 position:50% align:center
Sure, go for it.
Ah! That's cold!

00:14:14.938 --> 00:14:17.023 position:50% align:center
Big Sis, huh?

00:14:25.448 --> 00:14:28.493 position:50% align:center
[ORDINARY] There, all done.
Look, we're twinsies.

00:14:28.576 --> 00:14:29.786 position:50% align:center
"Twinsies"?

00:14:29.869 --> 00:14:32.122 position:50% align:center
Yeah, cause our clothes match.

00:14:44.926 --> 00:14:47.053 position:50% align:center
[ORDINARY]
Sorry for the wait.

00:14:47.137 --> 00:14:50.348 position:50% align:center
Why don't we look around
for some more supplies?

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:55.020 position:50% align:center
[ORDINARY] Seven cans of food
and four water bottles.

00:14:55.103 --> 00:14:57.355 position:50% align:center
About two days' worth?

00:14:57.439 --> 00:14:59.858 position:50% align:center
We need to be conservative
with our food.

00:14:59.941 --> 00:15:02.068 position:50% align:center
And we can't stay here forever.

00:15:02.152 --> 00:15:04.195 position:50% align:center
Where are we gonna go?

00:15:04.279 --> 00:15:06.740 position:50% align:center
That I don't know just yet,
but don't worry.

00:15:06.823 --> 00:15:12.704 position:50% align:center
I'll protect you wherever we
are. Cause I'm your big sis.

00:15:12.787 --> 00:15:16.041 position:50% align:center
I remember when Brother said
the exact same thing to me.

00:15:16.124 --> 00:15:18.543 position:50% align:center
That he would always protect me.

00:15:18.626 --> 00:15:21.004 position:50% align:center
And to come with him.

00:15:21.087 --> 00:15:23.214 position:50% align:center
But then he left me

00:15:23.298 --> 00:15:28.094 position:50% align:center
and went somewhere else,
and said to run.

00:15:28.178 --> 00:15:30.263 position:50% align:center
But he doesn't get it.

00:15:30.347 --> 00:15:35.143 position:50% align:center
Cuz as long as I can be with
my Brother, anywhere's fine.

00:15:35.226 --> 00:15:36.561 position:50% align:center
Even Kanto.

00:15:36.644 --> 00:15:40.148 position:50% align:center
I don't care where we are
as long as we're together.

00:15:40.231 --> 00:15:45.612 position:50% align:center
Brother! I miss you.
I miss you so much!

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:48.948 position:50% align:center
Let's go find your brother.

00:15:49.032 --> 00:15:52.535 position:50% align:center
We'll save him together.
I'll take you to him.

00:15:52.619 --> 00:15:56.706 position:50% align:center
Because, like I said,
I'm your big sis now.

00:16:21.314 --> 00:16:24.067 position:50% align:center
Uh, nothing. Just trying
to get out of the rain.

You're in our house, understand?

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:43.461 position:50% align:center
[DEGEN C] Who cares.
Her age doesn't matter,

00:16:43.545 --> 00:16:45.422 position:50% align:center
let's say she's nine
and sell her.

00:16:45.505 --> 00:16:48.591 position:50% align:center
And if we can't find a
buyer for the older one,

00:16:48.675 --> 00:16:49.801 position:50% align:center
we can kill her.
