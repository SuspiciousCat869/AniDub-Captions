00:00:15.932 --> 00:00:18.184 position:50% align:center
We're too late!
It already left!

00:00:18.268 --> 00:00:21.021 position:50% align:center
[MASTER] To think, they actually
raided the Shinkansen.

00:00:21.104 --> 00:00:22.355 position:50% align:center
How interesting.

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.733 position:50% align:center
Damn it! Rotten Akudama!

00:00:24.816 --> 00:00:27.110 position:50% align:center
[MASTER] There's still time
before it picks up speed.

00:00:27.193 --> 00:00:28.361 position:50% align:center
Let's go.

00:00:28.445 --> 00:00:29.904 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir!

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:04.916 position:50% align:center
[BLACK CAT] The Shinkansen
departing like that

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.461 position:50% align:center
was unexpected, but the
invasion was still a success.

00:02:08.545 --> 00:02:10.964 position:50% align:center
Wait, does that means things
aren't going as planned?

00:02:11.047 --> 00:02:13.383 position:50% align:center
Well, it's not like we
failed the job yet.

00:02:13.466 --> 00:02:14.968 position:50% align:center
[BLACK CAT]
We've made it on board.

00:02:15.051 --> 00:02:17.804 position:50% align:center
As long as we secure the vault,
we'll have cleared the mission.

00:02:17.887 --> 00:02:20.557 position:50% align:center
Meaning all of this has been
within your expectations?

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.643 position:50% align:center
[BLACK CAT] Having a plan
doesn't guarantee anything.

00:02:23.727 --> 00:02:27.772 position:50% align:center
That said, we only have
ten minutes remaining.

00:02:27.856 --> 00:02:29.024 position:50% align:center
If we take any longer,

00:02:29.107 --> 00:02:31.234 position:50% align:center
we'll be plunging into
the void of doom.

00:02:31.317 --> 00:02:35.030 position:50% align:center
The Absolute Quarantine Zone.

00:02:35.113 --> 00:02:38.825 position:50% align:center
But knowing you guys,
that should plenty of time.

00:02:38.908 --> 00:02:40.994 position:50% align:center
Heh! Damn straight,
that's more than enough.

00:02:41.077 --> 00:02:44.080 position:50% align:center
Cut the chitchat, the kitty
just said we have 10 minutes.

00:02:44.164 --> 00:02:46.332 position:50% align:center
We should hurry
and find the vault.

00:02:46.416 --> 00:02:47.876 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.211 position:50% align:center
Um. Please tell me that
isn't what I think it is.

00:02:50.295 --> 00:02:51.880 position:50% align:center
Crap! Executioners!

00:02:51.963 --> 00:02:53.298 position:50% align:center
[BLACK CAT]
Were they able to piece together

00:02:53.381 --> 00:02:54.799 position:50% align:center
what we were plotting?

00:02:54.883 --> 00:02:56.760 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR] That huge power outage
may have tipped them off.

00:02:56.843 --> 00:02:58.136 position:50% align:center
Just a guess.

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:00.138 position:50% align:center
You accounted for this though,
right Mister Kitty?

00:03:00.221 --> 00:03:01.890 position:50% align:center
--[BLACK CAT] I did not.
--What?

00:03:01.973 --> 00:03:03.141 position:50% align:center
[BLACK CAT]
Brawler and Cutthroat,

00:03:03.224 --> 00:03:04.893 position:50% align:center
if you'd please dispatch them?

00:03:04.976 --> 00:03:08.063 position:50% align:center
Stealing the vault is futile
as long as they're around.

00:03:08.146 --> 00:03:09.898 position:50% align:center
You know you ain't
gotta ask me twice

00:03:09.981 --> 00:03:10.815 position:50% align:center
when fighting's on the table!

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:12.734 position:50% align:center
Aw, I'd rather go with Swindler.

00:03:12.817 --> 00:03:14.569 position:50% align:center
Priorities, Mister Cutthroat!

00:03:14.652 --> 00:03:17.238 position:50% align:center
[BLACK CAT] Whatever, the rest
of you are coming with me.

00:03:17.322 --> 00:03:19.532 position:50% align:center
Hacker. If you would open
the door to the next carriage.

00:03:19.616 --> 00:03:23.036 position:50% align:center
Hacking the Shinkansen,
huh, sounds like fun.

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:26.164 position:50% align:center
Bring it on! Cause I'm
like a moth to a maim!

00:03:26.247 --> 00:03:28.541 position:50% align:center
I think you meant "moth
to a flame," Brother.

00:03:28.625 --> 00:03:30.669 position:50% align:center
Yeah, what my boy said!

00:03:36.508 --> 00:03:38.301 position:50% align:center
[MASTER]
You're busted, Akudama.

00:03:38.385 --> 00:03:39.761 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:42.180 position:50% align:center
Man, this is gonna be fun!

00:03:42.263 --> 00:03:44.140 position:50% align:center
This time, I won't fail!

[PUPIL groans]

00:03:51.398 --> 00:03:54.025 position:50% align:center
A brawler never takes
his eyes off the prize.

00:03:59.948 --> 00:04:03.076 position:50% align:center
[MASTER] It appears that's one
thing we have in common. Scum.

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:05.620 position:50% align:center
Call this revenge for what
happened at the hotel.

00:04:05.704 --> 00:04:07.038 position:50% align:center

This weakling again.

00:04:07.122 --> 00:04:09.165 position:50% align:center

I'll execute your face!

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:11.042 position:50% align:center
[MASTER]
Watch yourself.

00:04:11.126 --> 00:04:14.796 position:50% align:center
Right back at 'cha. I knew you

00:04:16.756 --> 00:04:17.841 position:50% align:center
I got it open!

00:04:17.924 --> 00:04:20.427 position:50% align:center
We gotta move, Courier!

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.554 position:50% align:center
Hello? Are you listening?

00:04:22.637 --> 00:04:26.975 position:50% align:center
[COURIER]
My bike. We need it for the job.

00:04:27.058 --> 00:04:30.353 position:50% align:center
[BRAWLER groans]

00:04:31.855 --> 00:04:33.732 position:50% align:center

you're doing? Hurry up!

00:04:33.815 --> 00:04:35.525 position:50% align:center
[ORDINARY]
Hold on, Mister Kitty.

00:04:35.608 --> 00:04:37.652 position:50% align:center
If Courier says we need
his bike for the job,

00:04:37.736 --> 00:04:41.239 position:50% align:center
then we probably do.
We should trust him.

00:04:41.322 --> 00:04:42.991 position:50% align:center
[BLACK CAT]
Fine.

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:48.621 position:50% align:center
[ORDINARY]
Seems like another freight car.

00:04:48.705 --> 00:04:51.791 position:50% align:center
[BLACK CAT] Damn Executioners!
If we don't get rid of them,

00:04:51.875 --> 00:04:54.002 position:50% align:center
all our work will
have been for nothing!

00:04:54.085 --> 00:04:56.379 position:50% align:center
Mister Kitty...

00:04:56.463 --> 00:05:00.175 position:50% align:center
Hey! Let's just stay focused
and make our way to the vault.

00:05:00.258 --> 00:05:04.095 position:50% align:center
That way, at least we can say
we accomplished something.

00:05:04.179 --> 00:05:05.680 position:50% align:center
[BLACK CAT]
You raise good points, Swindler.

00:05:05.764 --> 00:05:08.058 position:50% align:center
We have to try.

00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:10.935 position:50% align:center
[HACKER] Looting, right in the
middle of a bad-end scenario.

00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:12.896 position:50% align:center
Sounds like an
entertaining challenge.

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:16.149 position:50% align:center
Dude this isn't just some
sort of game, y'know!

00:05:16.232 --> 00:05:18.860 position:50% align:center
Spilling the blood of
Executioners is all right.

00:05:18.943 --> 00:05:21.112 position:50% align:center
But nothing compares
to being at your side.

00:05:21.196 --> 00:05:22.614 position:50% align:center
Is that a compliment?

00:05:22.697 --> 00:05:23.907 position:50% align:center
Whoa, wait a second!

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:25.909 position:50% align:center
You're the most infamous

--Lady, Chill!

We've got no clue what's
waiting for us up ahead.

00:05:30.121 --> 00:05:32.457 position:50% align:center
Don't you think it'd be better
if we had some backup?

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.501 position:50% align:center
I guess, but what
about the others?

00:05:34.584 --> 00:05:35.794 position:50% align:center
[thud]

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:42.008 position:50% align:center
[MASTER] Without that
bike to save your skin,

00:05:42.092 --> 00:05:44.969 position:50% align:center
you're nothing
but a common thug.

00:05:45.053 --> 00:05:48.723 position:50% align:center
[COURIER] Actually, I'm an
exceptional thug. And plus...

00:05:48.807 --> 00:05:52.602 position:50% align:center
No matter how shit the
situation, I never fail.

00:05:52.686 --> 00:05:57.065 position:50% align:center
That damn dreadlocked oaf!
I'm gonna dissect him!

00:05:59.025 --> 00:06:00.694 position:50% align:center
[MASTER]
Worthless Pupil.

00:06:00.777 --> 00:06:03.446 position:50% align:center
Doctors, on the other hand,
can be quite useful.

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.782 position:50% align:center
Curious, if I split you in two,

00:06:05.865 --> 00:06:07.492 position:50% align:center
can you stitch
yourself together?

00:06:07.575 --> 00:06:09.661 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR] Never had the luxury
of that happening before,

00:06:09.744 --> 00:06:11.329 position:50% align:center
but I think I could manage.

00:06:11.413 --> 00:06:14.290 position:50% align:center
You should know, some
people don't need doctors.

00:06:14.374 --> 00:06:15.917 position:50% align:center

00:06:26.261 --> 00:06:30.181 position:50% align:center
[MASTER] Sorry, I don't take
criticism from meatheads.

00:06:30.265 --> 00:06:31.975 position:50% align:center
[HACKER] The encryption on
this door is heavier than

00:06:32.058 --> 00:06:34.894 position:50% align:center
the previous. You don't want us
to see what's ahead, huh?

00:06:34.978 --> 00:06:36.146 position:50% align:center
Now I'm even more interested.

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:37.689 position:50% align:center
[HOODLUM] At this rate,
we're not gonna make--

00:06:37.772 --> 00:06:38.982 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:06:46.239 --> 00:06:48.158 position:50% align:center
So, uh, we going faster or...?

00:06:48.241 --> 00:06:51.661 position:50% align:center
[BLACK CAT] We've left Kansai,
so our acceleration's increased.

00:06:51.745 --> 00:06:55.498 position:50% align:center
Five minutes until we enter
the Absolute Quarantine Zone.

00:06:55.582 --> 00:06:58.376 position:50% align:center
Wha--! How're we supposed to
steal the vault in five minutes?

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.837 position:50% align:center
We have to try, we're already
this far in, so why not!

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.339 position:50% align:center
[BLACK CAT]
Swindler is right.

00:07:02.422 --> 00:07:03.673 position:50% align:center
[HACKER] As long as the other
four doors take an average

00:07:03.757 --> 00:07:05.383 position:50% align:center
of one minute to break through,

00:07:05.467 --> 00:07:07.344 position:50% align:center
we should have
enough time to make it.

00:07:07.427 --> 00:07:08.720 position:50% align:center
But if we assume each door

00:07:08.803 --> 00:07:10.805 position:50% align:center
is going to be progressively
more difficult to crack,

00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:12.307 position:50% align:center
we'd only have a
matter of seconds

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:13.516 position:50% align:center
to break through the final lock.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.101 position:50% align:center
[BLACK CAT]

00:07:15.185 --> 00:07:20.023 position:50% align:center

00:08:37.183 --> 00:08:39.477 position:50% align:center

he could end up killed!

Maybe I'll take a turn.

00:08:41.646 --> 00:08:44.774 position:50% align:center

00:09:03.543 --> 00:09:06.546 position:50% align:center
Uh. Wait, for real?

00:09:08.965 --> 00:09:11.843 position:50% align:center
[HOODLUM]
Bro! Imma whoop his ass, too!

00:09:11.926 --> 00:09:14.471 position:50% align:center
You've given me no
choice but to go all out!

00:09:14.554 --> 00:09:17.849 position:50% align:center
Oh, it's on! Hear that?
You're a dead man!

00:09:17.932 --> 00:09:19.225 position:50% align:center

00:09:19.309 --> 00:09:23.480 position:50% align:center

forever, stupid Pupil?

00:09:23.563 --> 00:09:25.940 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Uh. I'm up!

00:09:26.024 --> 00:09:27.400 position:50% align:center
[MASTER]
What's an Executioner's duty?

00:09:27.484 --> 00:09:30.153 position:50% align:center
[PUPIL] To remove the
dregs of society. Sir!

00:09:30.236 --> 00:09:32.364 position:50% align:center
[MASTER]
Then get on your feet and do it.

00:09:32.447 --> 00:09:35.241 position:50% align:center
Those unable to perform
have no right to the uniform!

00:09:35.325 --> 00:09:36.409 position:50% align:center
[PUPIL]
Right!

00:09:36.493 --> 00:09:38.370 position:50% align:center
Wow, you'd fit right in
with these stiffs.

00:09:38.453 --> 00:09:40.121 position:50% align:center
[COURIER]
Shut your mouth, shithead.

00:09:40.205 --> 00:09:41.915 position:50% align:center
Go out there and give
it your best shot,

00:09:41.998 --> 00:09:44.125 position:50% align:center
I don't wanna show off
and upstage anyone.

00:09:44.209 --> 00:09:46.628 position:50% align:center
Are you sure? 'Cause after
I'm done with him,

00:09:46.711 --> 00:09:49.255 position:50% align:center
there's not gonna be
a whole lot left.

00:09:49.339 --> 00:09:51.341 position:50% align:center
Yep, all yours, my dude!

00:09:51.424 --> 00:09:53.760 position:50% align:center
But you just coughed up blood!

00:09:53.843 --> 00:09:56.596 position:50% align:center
[BRAWLER] You should get lost if
that's is enough to scare ya.

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:59.891 position:50% align:center
I'll slice anyone who tries
to take you from me.

00:09:59.974 --> 00:10:03.436 position:50% align:center
[BLACK CAT]

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:06.481 position:50% align:center
You two better not die!

00:10:09.067 --> 00:10:11.695 position:50% align:center
[MASTER] Three minutes until
the Absolute Quarantine Zone.

00:10:11.778 --> 00:10:15.573 position:50% align:center
Before then,
I'll execute you all!

00:10:20.787 --> 00:10:23.081 position:50% align:center
Such filthy eyes.

00:10:25.458 --> 00:10:28.294 position:50% align:center
[CUTTHROAT] But that's okay.
Blood makes everyone pretty.

00:10:28.378 --> 00:10:31.506 position:50% align:center
So I'll make you bloom
like a big, red flower!

00:10:31.589 --> 00:10:34.050 position:50% align:center
[MASTER] You certainly earned
those 900 plus years.

00:10:34.134 --> 00:10:35.969 position:50% align:center
[HOODLUM gasping]

00:10:36.052 --> 00:10:41.599 position:50% align:center
Huh. How bizarre. This is
a passenger car, right?

00:10:41.683 --> 00:10:44.686 position:50% align:center
[HACKER] For real?
So People ride on this, too?

00:10:44.769 --> 00:10:48.773 position:50% align:center
[BLACK CAT] It certainly appears
that way. Let's continue.

00:10:55.196 --> 00:10:56.948 position:50% align:center
[HACKER]
It's unlocked.

00:10:59.492 --> 00:11:01.619 position:50% align:center
Wait, is this one the same?

00:11:01.703 --> 00:11:05.248 position:50% align:center
[HACKER] Then it's true. This
thing does take people to Kanto.

00:11:05.331 --> 00:11:06.750 position:50% align:center
You'd think there
would have at least

00:11:06.833 --> 00:11:08.918 position:50% align:center
been some rumors
about that, though.

00:11:09.002 --> 00:11:10.879 position:50% align:center
If it does,
that's kinda terrifying.

00:11:10.962 --> 00:11:14.049 position:50% align:center
[HACKER] A while back when I was
digging around the Seal Center,

00:11:14.132 --> 00:11:16.801 position:50% align:center
I discovered there was a
profile on the Shinkansen.

00:11:16.885 --> 00:11:19.220 position:50% align:center
Diving deeper, I discovered
some sort of connection

00:11:19.304 --> 00:11:21.222 position:50% align:center
between the train and
seals from Kansai.

00:11:21.306 --> 00:11:23.767 position:50% align:center
Then, that would mean
the people of Kansai

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:26.478 position:50% align:center
have some sort of tie
to the Shinkansen?

00:11:26.561 --> 00:11:29.522 position:50% align:center
Huh. I've never seen
anything about that.

00:11:29.606 --> 00:11:30.982 position:50% align:center
Neither have I.

00:11:31.066 --> 00:11:33.651 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, I wasn't able
to investigate any further

00:11:33.735 --> 00:11:35.904 position:50% align:center
because a stupid firewall
got in my way.

00:11:35.987 --> 00:11:37.697 position:50% align:center
If these are passenger cars,

00:11:37.781 --> 00:11:40.784 position:50% align:center
it's likely people have taken
the train to Kanto before!

00:11:40.867 --> 00:11:42.077 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's true.

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:44.079 position:50% align:center
If it's been done already,

00:11:44.162 --> 00:11:46.664 position:50% align:center
then maybe I'll actually
make it to Kanto, after all.

00:11:46.748 --> 00:11:49.125 position:50% align:center
I'll say goodbye to
crummy Kansai for good,

00:11:49.209 --> 00:11:51.961 position:50% align:center
and then start over fresh
in an unparalleled utopia.

00:11:52.045 --> 00:11:54.714 position:50% align:center
[BLACK CAT]
It's no utopia!

00:11:54.798 --> 00:11:58.677 position:50% align:center
At this rate, we'll enter the
Absolute Quarantine Zone.

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:00.136 position:50% align:center
Even if you survive that,

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:02.472 position:50% align:center
there's the Decontamination
Zone afterwards,

00:12:02.555 --> 00:12:04.140 position:50% align:center
which purges all organic matter.

00:12:04.224 --> 00:12:06.851 position:50% align:center
Uh. Decontamination Zone?

00:12:06.935 --> 00:12:09.187 position:50% align:center
[BLACK CAT] I'm saying you
can't reach Kanto alive.

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:10.772 position:50% align:center
It's impossible.

00:12:10.855 --> 00:12:12.774 position:50% align:center
So, um... Question.

00:12:12.857 --> 00:12:15.527 position:50% align:center
How, exactly, do you know
so much about the place?

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:19.364 position:50% align:center
[BLACK CAT] Doesn't matter.
It's of no concern to you.

00:12:20.949 --> 00:12:22.534 position:50% align:center
I'll get there.

Oh, sure!

The one between Kanto

00:14:47.554 --> 00:14:49.514 position:50% align:center
Kanto dropped that huge bomb.

00:14:49.597 --> 00:14:53.101 position:50% align:center
[BUNNY] Bulls-eye! The war
wouldn't have ended without it!

00:14:55.395 --> 00:14:57.480 position:50% align:center
were contaminated

[BUNNY] Yup! It's between
Kansai and Kanto!

00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:09.534 position:50% align:center
The Shinkansen has

Wouldn't that mean Kanto

00:15:17.667 --> 00:15:20.170 position:50% align:center
[BUNNY] That's what Kanto's

00:15:20.253 --> 00:15:22.339 position:50% align:center
It sterilizes and

Don't worry.

At this point, we don't

00:16:31.199 --> 00:16:33.868 position:50% align:center
If we're able to get it open,
we'll work things out.

00:16:33.952 --> 00:16:36.746 position:50% align:center
This keeps getting
more interesting.

But this is work.

00:16:55.724 --> 00:16:58.768 position:50% align:center

Well, well!

00:17:09.946 --> 00:17:12.615 position:50% align:center
We made it to that
Absolute Quarantine Zone.

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:43.521 position:50% align:center
I see how it is.

Well, we got here.

It's not gonna budge

And based on what I'm seeing,

00:19:58.406 --> 00:19:59.908 position:50% align:center
it's gotta be a
pretty special one.

Uh. You mean you can't get in?

[BLACK CAT]
It's all right.

No, wait!

00:20:34.234 --> 00:20:35.318 position:50% align:center
It's a seal.
