An Executioner!

00:00:10.927 --> 00:00:12.470 position:50% align:center
[MASTER]
Yo, Akudama.

00:00:12.554 --> 00:00:16.099 position:50% align:center
Aw, you're alone?
Where's the red-eyed one?

00:00:16.182 --> 00:00:18.268 position:50% align:center
Just who I wanted to see!

00:00:18.351 --> 00:00:22.981 position:50% align:center
[MASTER] Letting you run amok
any longer will tarnish my name.

00:00:23.064 --> 00:00:26.317 position:50% align:center
This feels like an appropriate
site for your graves.

00:00:26.401 --> 00:00:28.028 position:50% align:center
Ha!

00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:32.657 position:50% align:center
[MASTER] It's time to
face your execution.

00:02:05.542 --> 00:02:09.004 position:50% align:center
[footsteps]

00:02:11.172 --> 00:02:14.509 position:50% align:center
You fool...
With injuries like yours,

00:02:14.592 --> 00:02:18.346 position:50% align:center
why would you go off
on your own?

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.348 position:50% align:center
Master!

00:02:21.307 --> 00:02:22.726 position:50% align:center
[MASTER]
Let's get started.

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:24.728 position:50% align:center
[BRAWLER]
Try 'n execute this!

00:02:24.811 --> 00:02:27.188 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna crush you
this time, ya hear?

00:02:27.272 --> 00:02:28.773 position:50% align:center
[MASTER]
Sorry to say,

00:02:28.857 --> 00:02:31.943 position:50% align:center
but I'll be getting serious
from the get-go.

00:02:34.195 --> 00:02:35.613 position:50% align:center
[MASTER] Nothing more
than a mindless meathead.

00:02:35.697 --> 00:02:36.948 position:50% align:center
[DRONE A]
Warning! Warning!

00:02:37.032 --> 00:02:38.116 position:50% align:center
[ORDINARY]
Hey!

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:39.993 position:50% align:center
That guy is
unreasonably obsessed

00:02:40.076 --> 00:02:42.120 position:50% align:center
with completing the job.

00:02:42.203 --> 00:02:45.040 position:50% align:center
[MASTER]
So that's what was in the vault.

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:47.751 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:02:51.212 --> 00:02:52.672 position:50% align:center

[CUTTHROAT]
Hang on, where are you going?

00:02:56.468 --> 00:02:58.178 position:50% align:center
Wait up, Swindler!

00:02:58.261 --> 00:03:01.389 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR]
Is this the end of the road?

00:03:01.473 --> 00:03:05.435 position:50% align:center
[MASTER] Nah, just your exit.
Stitch that up.

00:03:05.518 --> 00:03:07.771 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR coughs]

00:03:07.854 --> 00:03:10.857 position:50% align:center
[MASTER]
Another one bites the dust.

00:03:12.317 --> 00:03:15.195 position:50% align:center
Holy shit, dude.
We're all gonna die!

00:03:15.278 --> 00:03:16.363 position:50% align:center
Are you okay?

00:03:16.446 --> 00:03:17.739 position:50% align:center
[BROTHER]
We're all right.

00:03:17.822 --> 00:03:20.408 position:50% align:center
You aren't bleeding, are you?
Is anything broken?

00:03:20.492 --> 00:03:21.910 position:50% align:center
We're fine, really.

00:03:21.993 --> 00:03:25.288 position:50% align:center
[sighs] You don't know
how relieved I am.

00:03:25.372 --> 00:03:28.416 position:50% align:center
Even if we were hurt,
it wouldn't matter.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.670 position:50% align:center
Oh! How about you,
Courier? You good?

00:03:31.753 --> 00:03:34.464 position:50% align:center
He's got some nerve to
hit my bike. Shithead

00:03:34.547 --> 00:03:36.549 position:50% align:center
[MASTER]
Quit whining!

00:03:38.093 --> 00:03:40.053 position:50% align:center
[MASTER] That ride of yours
is a real nuisance.

00:03:40.136 --> 00:03:43.056 position:50% align:center
[COURIER] The only nuisance
here is you, you shit!

00:03:53.108 --> 00:03:57.946 position:50% align:center
[screams] Mister Cutthroat?

00:03:58.029 --> 00:04:00.615 position:50% align:center
It'll be okay. I'm not
gonna let you die.

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:02.617 position:50% align:center
[ORDINARY]
Wait a sec!

00:04:03.618 --> 00:04:05.495 position:50% align:center
[CUTTHROAT laughing]

00:04:08.164 --> 00:04:10.000 position:50% align:center
[CUTTHROAT gasps, screams]

00:04:10.083 --> 00:04:12.127 position:50% align:center
Mister Cutthroat!

00:04:13.294 --> 00:04:14.921 position:50% align:center
Get moving!

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.926 position:50% align:center
Now's our chance! Let's go!

00:04:22.637 --> 00:04:24.431 position:50% align:center
[PUPIL]
Shit!

00:04:24.514 --> 00:04:27.642 position:50% align:center
He must have gone chasing
after those damn Akudama.

00:04:27.726 --> 00:04:30.145 position:50% align:center
How does he know where they are?

00:04:34.607 --> 00:04:35.859 position:50% align:center
Could Boss know?

00:04:35.942 --> 00:04:38.987 position:50% align:center
[HOODLUM panting]

00:04:41.197 --> 00:04:47.037 position:50% align:center
[HOODLUM] Holy crap, not him.
Bro! You're not dead, right?

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.041 position:50% align:center
[BRAWLER yells, coughs]
Own blood's tryin' choke me!

00:04:51.124 --> 00:04:54.294 position:50% align:center
How hurt are you, bro? I don't
think that's a good sign!

00:04:54.377 --> 00:04:57.339 position:50% align:center
Nothing major, just some
broken ribs and organ damage.

00:04:57.422 --> 00:04:59.257 position:50% align:center
Plus my wound's reopened

00:04:59.341 --> 00:05:01.718 position:50% align:center
Well, that's like the
definition of "major"!

00:05:01.801 --> 00:05:05.180 position:50% align:center
Nah! I'm totally fine,
my brother!

00:05:06.723 --> 00:05:08.016 position:50% align:center
Oh!

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:10.060 position:50% align:center
We got crazy lucky and that
Executioner went chasing

00:05:10.143 --> 00:05:12.520 position:50% align:center
after the others. This is our
chance to run and heal up!

00:05:12.604 --> 00:05:13.938 position:50% align:center
Run?

00:05:14.022 --> 00:05:15.398 position:50% align:center
Yeah! But once you're better,
we can whoop his ass!

00:05:15.482 --> 00:05:17.233 position:50% align:center
I mean, I know you can
beat him at your best.

00:05:17.317 --> 00:05:19.986 position:50% align:center
You're the toughest guy there
is, he doesn't stand a chance!

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.197 position:50% align:center
Trust me, I was
servin' 500 million!

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.406 position:50% align:center
Y'know what I'm sayin'?

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:24.991 position:50% align:center
We'll just fall back
for a while, and then--

00:05:25.075 --> 00:05:29.037 position:50% align:center
[BRAWLER] Hell no. And pass up
on an awesome fight like this?

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.457 position:50% align:center
Ain't no way that's
gonna happen! Ha, ha, ha!

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:40.131 position:50% align:center
[gasping] So true. Yeah,
you're right. Totally.

00:05:40.215 --> 00:05:42.258 position:50% align:center
--I am?
--Damn straight, my bro!

00:05:42.342 --> 00:05:44.886 position:50% align:center
A fight like this doesn't
happen every day, does it?

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:47.263 position:50% align:center
How about we go beat that
scumbag's ass together!

00:05:47.347 --> 00:05:49.099 position:50% align:center
You get me, brother,
so let's not waste

00:05:49.182 --> 00:05:51.518 position:50% align:center
another damn second here! Ight!

00:05:51.601 --> 00:05:52.894 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:05:52.977 --> 00:05:56.231 position:50% align:center
Let's go! Let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go!

00:05:56.314 --> 00:05:58.858 position:50% align:center
[HOODLUM screaming]

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:06.366 position:50% align:center

Die already.

00:06:10.662 --> 00:06:12.080 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:27.345 position:50% align:center
[MASTER] This is as far
as you'll be going.

00:06:27.429 --> 00:06:31.099 position:50% align:center
Once I kill you, I'll be taking
the goods back to safety.

00:06:31.182 --> 00:06:32.642 position:50% align:center
Gah, I'm stuck under this!

00:06:32.726 --> 00:06:35.562 position:50% align:center
[BROTHER]
Heh, yeah. "Safety."

00:06:35.645 --> 00:06:37.522 position:50% align:center
We were being
shipped off to Kanto.

00:06:37.605 --> 00:06:39.691 position:50% align:center
[MASTER]
Good enough for me!

00:06:43.278 --> 00:06:44.946 position:50% align:center
[MASTER]
What the--?

00:06:46.031 --> 00:06:48.241 position:50% align:center
[MASTER]
You cut off your own legs?

00:06:48.324 --> 00:06:50.869 position:50% align:center
The hell is wrong with you?

00:06:52.078 --> 00:06:54.080 position:50% align:center
Don't you dare touch my angel!

00:06:54.164 --> 00:06:55.665 position:50% align:center
[MASTER]
You're deranged!

00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:57.417 position:50% align:center
[ORDINARY screams]

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.336 position:50% align:center
[MASTER]
Time to die!

00:07:03.006 --> 00:07:04.841 position:50% align:center
[MASTER groans]

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:18.229 position:50% align:center
Aw, man! It didn't reach
far enough in?

00:07:18.313 --> 00:07:21.316 position:50% align:center
It's harder to follow through
without legs than I thought.

00:07:21.399 --> 00:07:25.570 position:50% align:center
[screaming]

00:07:25.653 --> 00:07:28.031 position:50% align:center
Red! Red! Red!

00:07:30.992 --> 00:07:33.495 position:50% align:center
[MASTER]
Akudama scum!

00:07:36.498 --> 00:07:38.333 position:50% align:center
No, no, no, this
isn't happening.

00:07:38.416 --> 00:07:39.834 position:50% align:center
[COURIER growls]

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:46.466 position:50% align:center
What do I do? What do I do?!
Someone... Someone help!

00:07:46.549 --> 00:07:49.969 position:50% align:center
Uh? I, uh... I think that your
brother might have been...

00:07:50.053 --> 00:07:51.012 position:50% align:center
He'll be fine.

00:07:51.096 --> 00:07:52.806 position:50% align:center
What?

00:07:58.478 --> 00:08:00.480 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:08:02.148 --> 00:08:04.609 position:50% align:center
You're making such
a fuss, Swindler.

00:08:04.693 --> 00:08:08.488 position:50% align:center
Honestly. The bigger problem is
that my backpack got destroyed.

00:08:08.571 --> 00:08:11.658 position:50% align:center
Thank goodness you're
alive! You scared me.

00:08:11.741 --> 00:08:13.368 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:08:13.451 --> 00:08:14.828 position:50% align:center
[SISTER gasps]

00:08:14.911 --> 00:08:17.163 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR]
Regeneration, huh?

00:08:17.247 --> 00:08:19.207 position:50% align:center
Guess it'll take more
than that to kill him.

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:22.168 position:50% align:center
Doctor? What happened
to your stomach?

00:08:22.252 --> 00:08:24.879 position:50% align:center
Oh, I just had to stitch
myself back together.

00:08:24.963 --> 00:08:27.048 position:50% align:center
Thought being split
in two would do me in,

00:08:27.132 --> 00:08:30.385 position:50% align:center
but it all worked out.
More importantly...

00:08:30.468 --> 00:08:33.513 position:50% align:center
Now we know why these kids
were locked up in that vault.

00:08:33.596 --> 00:08:35.807 position:50% align:center
It's no wonder Kanto wanted you.

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:38.268 position:50% align:center
I'm not going to let
anybody take them!

00:08:38.351 --> 00:08:42.313 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR] Cut the holier-than-
thou act. It makes me sick.

00:08:42.397 --> 00:08:44.441 position:50% align:center
Anyway, back to
the matter at hand.

00:08:44.524 --> 00:08:47.444 position:50% align:center
I think we can handle
this Executioner.

00:08:47.527 --> 00:08:49.446 position:50% align:center
[MASTER]
Give it up!

00:08:54.701 --> 00:08:56.119 position:50% align:center
[MASTER]
Now what?

00:08:56.202 --> 00:08:58.580 position:50% align:center
[BRAWLER] Got 'em! My bro's
tackle is sick, ain't it?

00:08:58.663 --> 00:09:02.042 position:50% align:center
Gotcha, bitch.

00:09:02.125 --> 00:09:05.670 position:50% align:center
[MASTER]
Damn freaks. So annoying.

00:09:05.754 --> 00:09:06.838 position:50% align:center
He's hurt?

00:09:06.921 --> 00:09:08.840 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR]
Trust me, I'm a doctor.

00:09:08.923 --> 00:09:10.592 position:50% align:center
I watched him
while playing dead.

00:09:10.675 --> 00:09:12.927 position:50% align:center
You can tell by
the way he's fighting.

00:09:13.011 --> 00:09:15.597 position:50% align:center
He's sluggish. Especially
when compared to how

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.682 position:50% align:center
well he fought
on the Shinkansen.

00:09:17.766 --> 00:09:19.684 position:50% align:center
I'm positive he's been injured.

00:09:19.768 --> 00:09:23.021 position:50% align:center
So you're saying there's
a chance we can win?

00:09:23.104 --> 00:09:26.274 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR] We don't have to win.
We just have to wear him down.

00:09:26.358 --> 00:09:27.525 position:50% align:center
But to do that.
We need fighters.

00:09:27.609 --> 00:09:29.277 position:50% align:center
My blood is so wonderfully red.

00:09:29.361 --> 00:09:30.487 position:50% align:center
Then you're gonna...

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:31.654 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:09:31.738 --> 00:09:35.450 position:50% align:center
You're way slower
than before! [groans]

00:09:35.533 --> 00:09:36.951 position:50% align:center
[MASTER]
Don't get cocky.

00:09:37.035 --> 00:09:41.081 position:50% align:center
I'm more than capable of
executing every last one of yo--

00:09:41.164 --> 00:09:44.501 position:50% align:center
[CUTTHROAT] Look! Look! My legs
and belly are all better!

00:09:44.584 --> 00:09:46.503 position:50% align:center
Kinda hurts, though.

00:09:46.586 --> 00:09:47.962 position:50% align:center
But now that I've
got my feet back,

00:09:48.046 --> 00:09:49.631 position:50% align:center
I can plant em square
on the ground

00:09:49.714 --> 00:09:51.841 position:50% align:center
and run my blade
right through you!

00:09:51.925 --> 00:09:55.053 position:50% align:center
[MASTER] Such a pain in
the ass, that Doctor.

00:09:58.264 --> 00:09:59.933 position:50% align:center
[MASTER]
Why won't any of you die?!

00:10:00.016 --> 00:10:01.726 position:50% align:center
[BRAWLER grunts]

00:10:03.853 --> 00:10:05.355 position:50% align:center
What's the plan?

00:10:05.438 --> 00:10:06.439 position:50% align:center
You and the kids get on.

00:10:06.523 --> 00:10:09.442 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Mm.

00:10:09.526 --> 00:10:10.944 position:50% align:center
We're ready, Courier!

00:10:11.027 --> 00:10:13.113 position:50% align:center
[CUTTHROAT]
Wait! You're leaving, Swindler?

00:10:13.196 --> 00:10:14.114 position:50% align:center
[MASTER]
Don't think so!

00:10:14.197 --> 00:10:16.241 position:50% align:center
Over here, prick!

00:10:21.871 --> 00:10:23.289 position:50% align:center
[BRAWLER]
What's the matter?

00:10:23.373 --> 00:10:25.709 position:50% align:center
Here I was thinking
we were having fun!

00:10:25.792 --> 00:10:27.794 position:50% align:center
So why the long face?

00:10:36.428 --> 00:10:37.637 position:50% align:center
[PUPIL]
Where is Master?

00:10:37.721 --> 00:10:39.097 position:50% align:center
What difference does it make?

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:43.101 position:50% align:center
If I know his location,
I can go and supply back-up!

00:10:43.184 --> 00:10:47.439 position:50% align:center
[sighs] I didn't think
you were this naïve.

00:10:47.522 --> 00:10:49.983 position:50% align:center
All the time you spent
working together,

00:10:50.066 --> 00:10:53.153 position:50% align:center
didn't you learn
anything from him?

00:10:53.236 --> 00:10:56.740 position:50% align:center
Your precious Master has shown
he's more than ready.

00:10:56.823 --> 00:11:01.202 position:50% align:center
The man is fully prepared to
carve his name on this monument.

00:11:08.126 --> 00:11:11.629 position:50% align:center
Aw, come on.
Don't back out now!

00:11:11.713 --> 00:11:13.298 position:50% align:center
[MASTER]
You're actually having fun.

00:11:13.381 --> 00:11:18.011 position:50% align:center
Hell yeah! I live for
this. It's everything.

00:11:18.094 --> 00:11:21.806 position:50% align:center
And I ain't letting anyone or
anything get between us now!

00:11:25.435 --> 00:11:28.938 position:50% align:center
Hey man. I'm not the only
one enjoying this, right?

00:11:29.022 --> 00:11:31.149 position:50% align:center
You havin' fun?

00:11:38.531 --> 00:11:40.450 position:50% align:center
[MASTER]
Y'know what?

00:11:46.122 --> 00:11:48.875 position:50% align:center
It's not that all that bad.

00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:55.006 position:50% align:center
[HOODLUM gasps]
Whoa. Wha-- What happened?

00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:58.343 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Bro?

00:11:58.426 --> 00:11:59.803 position:50% align:center
[BOSS]
Let me ask you something.

00:11:59.886 --> 00:12:01.304 position:50% align:center
Do you know the
reason why I started

00:12:01.388 --> 00:12:03.682 position:50% align:center
making Executioners
work in teams of two

00:12:03.765 --> 00:12:05.350 position:50% align:center
as opposed to going
out on their own?

00:12:05.433 --> 00:12:07.519 position:50% align:center
--No.
--This monument bears the names

00:12:07.602 --> 00:12:10.021 position:50% align:center
of over a thousand people
who've given their lives

00:12:10.105 --> 00:12:14.693 position:50% align:center
for our mission, at one point
the casualty rate was over 80%.

00:12:14.776 --> 00:12:18.655 position:50% align:center
As to why, most simply have
no sense of self preservation.

00:12:18.738 --> 00:12:21.825 position:50% align:center
Tasked with the honorable duty
of executing Akudama,

00:12:21.908 --> 00:12:24.494 position:50% align:center
they sought out
their own deaths.

00:12:27.997 --> 00:12:32.585 position:50% align:center
In that aspect, Executioners
barely differ from Akudama.

00:12:32.669 --> 00:12:38.258 position:50% align:center
However, our duty of purging
evil is futile when dead.

00:12:38.341 --> 00:12:40.135 position:50% align:center
So I had to give
the Executioners

00:12:40.218 --> 00:12:44.597 position:50% align:center
a reason to live. "Feelings."

00:12:44.681 --> 00:12:46.433 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:12:51.563 --> 00:12:54.357 position:50% align:center
[panting]

00:12:54.441 --> 00:13:00.905 position:50% align:center
[panting] What's wrong?!
Outta of breath already?

00:13:00.989 --> 00:13:04.242 position:50% align:center
What happened to the guy I
fought on the Shinkansen?

00:13:04.325 --> 00:13:08.621 position:50% align:center
Can't go all out without your
partner watchin' or something?

00:13:08.705 --> 00:13:10.707 position:50% align:center
What a stupid thing to say.

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:13.460 position:50% align:center
It's 'cuz she's gone that
I can finally get serious.

00:13:13.543 --> 00:13:16.212 position:50% align:center
How about you
prove it then, pal!

00:13:16.296 --> 00:13:19.132 position:50% align:center
Show me what
you're workin' with!

00:13:19.215 --> 00:13:20.425 position:50% align:center
Seriously, in here?

00:13:20.508 --> 00:13:23.345 position:50% align:center
Hey, what better place
for a fist-fight?

00:13:27.432 --> 00:13:30.101 position:50% align:center
By creating teams comprised
of master and pupil,

00:13:30.185 --> 00:13:33.730 position:50% align:center
a connection is formed, driving
each other's desire to live.

00:13:33.813 --> 00:13:36.524 position:50% align:center
Though problems
arise on occasion.

00:13:36.608 --> 00:13:38.735 position:50% align:center
That "connection" is
the biggest difference

00:13:38.818 --> 00:13:42.864 position:50% align:center
between us and those Akudama.
It's also our biggest strength.

00:13:42.947 --> 00:13:45.241 position:50% align:center
When prepared to die,
that relationship fuels

00:13:45.325 --> 00:13:48.870 position:50% align:center
a desire to live, and
births immense power.

00:13:48.953 --> 00:13:53.166 position:50% align:center
Due to this initiative, the
casualty rate has fallen to 30%.

00:13:53.249 --> 00:13:54.751 position:50% align:center
Feelings between
master and pupil

00:13:54.834 --> 00:13:57.295 position:50% align:center
have improved the
chances of survival.

00:13:57.379 --> 00:14:00.173 position:50% align:center
You just said yourself that
we've been paired for a reason!

00:14:00.256 --> 00:14:02.342 position:50% align:center
So why would I sit here
and let him get killed?

00:14:02.425 --> 00:14:04.135 position:50% align:center
[BOSS]
You realize he left you behind

00:14:04.219 --> 00:14:07.597 position:50% align:center
and went to execute
the Akudama alone.

00:14:09.349 --> 00:14:10.767 position:50% align:center
I don't...

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:15.772 position:50% align:center
[BOSS] He made his decision.
He's prepared to die.

00:14:18.983 --> 00:14:20.819 position:50% align:center
[BOSS]
Go and see for yourself.

00:14:20.902 --> 00:14:24.364 position:50% align:center
Your Master's determination
and strength.

00:14:25.949 --> 00:14:28.493 position:50% align:center
[MASTER panting]

00:14:31.746 --> 00:14:35.250 position:50% align:center
[BRAWLER wheezing, grunting]

00:15:23.256 --> 00:15:24.758 position:50% align:center
Bro, you...

00:15:24.841 --> 00:15:28.428 position:50% align:center
[PUPIL panting]

00:15:28.511 --> 00:15:30.055 position:50% align:center
Master.

00:15:44.736 --> 00:15:47.530 position:50% align:center
Awesome! This is the best!

00:15:47.614 --> 00:15:50.075 position:50% align:center
[pants]

00:15:50.158 --> 00:15:54.412 position:50% align:center
Why the hell are you even
doing this, you fool?

00:15:54.496 --> 00:15:57.457 position:50% align:center
Because I freakin' love it!

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:02.629 position:50% align:center
[PUPIL]
Master!

00:16:02.712 --> 00:16:04.714 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:08.176 --> 00:16:12.472 position:50% align:center
I think I get it.

00:16:12.555 --> 00:16:17.811 position:50% align:center
But it's people like you guys
I hate more than anything!

00:16:44.754 --> 00:16:48.842 position:50% align:center
Master? Master!

00:16:52.012 --> 00:16:55.140 position:50% align:center
[PUPIL]
Master...

00:16:55.223 --> 00:16:58.435 position:50% align:center
We have to get you
to a hospital!

00:16:58.518 --> 00:17:01.730 position:50% align:center
[inaudible]

00:18:29.526 --> 00:18:32.904 position:50% align:center
[HOODLUM screaming]

00:18:38.368 --> 00:18:40.370 position:50% align:center
[BUNNY]
Heyo! Bunny here!

00:18:40.453 --> 00:18:42.205 position:50% align:center
[SHARK]
And Shark!

00:18:42.288 --> 00:18:43.415 position:50% align:center
[BUNNY]
Hey, hey, Sharkie!

00:18:43.498 --> 00:18:45.542 position:50% align:center
You know about
Old Kansai, right?

00:18:45.625 --> 00:18:48.294 position:50% align:center
[SHARK] Hmm. Isn't that
the city that was abandoned

00:18:48.378 --> 00:18:51.965 position:50% align:center
after Kanto dropped that big ol'
bomb on it during the war?

00:18:52.048 --> 00:18:54.384 position:50% align:center
[BUNNY] Uh-huh! The shock wave
from the explosion

00:18:54.467 --> 00:18:57.137 position:50% align:center
was so intense, it blew up
a bunch of the buildings

00:18:57.220 --> 00:19:00.015 position:50% align:center
and made the area
pretty uninhabitable.

00:19:00.098 --> 00:19:01.683 position:50% align:center
[SHARK]
Yup, and the closer you get

00:19:01.766 --> 00:19:05.103 position:50% align:center
to the Absolute Quarantine Zone,
the worse the damage is.

00:19:05.186 --> 00:19:07.022 position:50% align:center
In the places that
were hit the hardest,

00:19:07.105 --> 00:19:09.232 position:50% align:center
there's literally nothing left!

00:19:09.315 --> 00:19:11.484 position:50% align:center
[BUNNY]
Yikes! That's scary!

00:19:11.568 --> 00:19:13.737 position:50% align:center
What happened to all the
people who lived there?

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:16.781 position:50% align:center
[SHARK] Most of 'em were dead on
impact after the bomb went off.

00:19:16.865 --> 00:19:18.533 position:50% align:center
Though I've heard whispers
that some of 'em

00:19:18.616 --> 00:19:22.579 position:50% align:center
fled underground and still
live there to this very day!

00:19:22.662 --> 00:19:27.000 position:50% align:center
Apparently, the lost language
they use is a real hoot!

00:19:27.083 --> 00:19:30.253 position:50% align:center
[BUNNY] Hoot? But thank heavens
Kanto is running things now.

00:19:30.337 --> 00:19:32.756 position:50% align:center
Ah, they'll keep all y'all
safe and sound!

00:19:32.839 --> 00:19:34.758 position:50% align:center
[SHARK]
"All y'all"?

00:19:36.051 --> 00:19:38.762 position:50% align:center
[SHARK]
Hurray for a controlled society!

00:19:38.845 --> 00:19:41.848 position:50% align:center
[SHARK, BUNNY]
Well, until next time!

00:19:47.437 --> 00:19:50.440 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR] So, this place
was your destination?

00:19:50.523 --> 00:19:53.318 position:50% align:center
It kind of is,
but also kinda isn't.

00:19:53.401 --> 00:19:54.819 position:50% align:center
You are so frustrating.

00:19:54.903 --> 00:19:57.238 position:50% align:center
0-0-1-0-0-3.

00:19:57.322 --> 00:19:58.239 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:19:58.323 --> 00:19:59.949 position:50% align:center
[BROTHER]
Please, just be patient.

00:20:00.033 --> 00:20:02.577 position:50% align:center
This would have been easier
if I had my backpack,

00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:05.622 position:50% align:center
but Cutthroat went and broke it.

00:20:09.376 --> 00:20:11.961 position:50% align:center
I wonder if it's gonna
start raining again.

00:20:12.045 --> 00:20:15.465 position:50% align:center
Mister Cutthroat... Back there.

00:20:15.548 --> 00:20:17.759 position:50% align:center
Why did you use
Brother as a shield?

00:20:17.842 --> 00:20:21.054 position:50% align:center
What? Because if I hadn't, you
would've been killed, obviously.

00:20:21.137 --> 00:20:22.347 position:50% align:center
That's no excuse!

00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:24.933 position:50% align:center
Oh, come on, it's you
we're talking about!

00:20:25.016 --> 00:20:28.561 position:50% align:center
Your life is more beautiful
than anything, s--

00:20:30.522 --> 00:20:32.107 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:20:39.155 --> 00:20:41.116 position:50% align:center
You're awful.

00:20:42.534 --> 00:20:46.162 position:50% align:center
[BROTHER] Found it. Pulling this
lever should open the entrance.

00:20:46.246 --> 00:20:49.124 position:50% align:center
The entrance? The entrance
to what, exactly?

00:20:49.207 --> 00:20:50.750 position:50% align:center
0-0-1-0-0-3.

00:20:50.834 --> 00:20:52.460 position:50% align:center
That's not helping
me understand.

00:20:52.544 --> 00:20:55.005 position:50% align:center
Maybe this will.

00:21:01.553 --> 00:21:03.013 position:50% align:center
Whaddya know?

00:21:05.348 --> 00:21:10.020 position:50% align:center
0-0-1-0-0-3. They're
underground coordinates.

00:23:45.759 --> 00:23:46.968 position:50% align:center
[BROTHER]
This is goodbye.
