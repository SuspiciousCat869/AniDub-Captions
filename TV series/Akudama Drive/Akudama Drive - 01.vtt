I promise I'll come back.

Ha! Can't guarantee
it'll be peaceful.

[HACKER] How should I
amuse myself today?

Maybe the Kansai Central Bank?

Heh. But with a
little bit of hacking,

00:07:26.696 --> 00:07:28.948 position:50% align:center

why didn't you pay?

00:10:06.356 --> 00:10:07.774 position:50% align:center
Because it's not my money!

And I don't mean
I stole it, either!

I was your prisoner.

00:20:59.134 --> 00:21:02.762 position:50% align:center
Pity. You should
have executed me.

00:21:12.188 --> 00:21:13.815 position:50% align:center

It appears Courier had
a different mission

00:21:23.908 --> 00:21:24.701 position:50% align:center
from the rest of us.

00:21:24.784 --> 00:21:27.454 position:50% align:center
What exactly did I walk into?

00:21:28.663 --> 00:21:31.041 position:50% align:center
The hell's this thing?

00:21:31.124 --> 00:21:32.375 position:50% align:center
A bomb!

00:21:32.459 --> 00:21:33.626 position:50% align:center
Why'd you put one on me?

I could just yank this
dumb crap off, y'know?

00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:37.630 position:50% align:center
Shit! Shit! Get it off!

00:21:37.714 --> 00:21:40.467 position:50% align:center

Sorry, I don't know
anything, either.

00:21:49.017 --> 00:21:52.228 position:50% align:center
This is all a huge mistake!
