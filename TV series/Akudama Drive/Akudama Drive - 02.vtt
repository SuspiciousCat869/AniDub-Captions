00:00:12.137 --> 00:00:15.974 position:50% align:center
The Shinkansen, huh?
'Bout time I took on a legend!

00:00:16.057 --> 00:00:18.727 position:50% align:center
Oh great and mighty
Shinkansen!

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.271 position:50% align:center
Sounds like a dicey job,
if you ask me.

00:00:21.354 --> 00:00:23.106 position:50% align:center
That cat better be
good for the money.

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.483 position:50% align:center
Everybody knows that
people of Kansai

00:00:25.567 --> 00:00:28.653 position:50% align:center
revere the Shinkansen.
I'm interested

00:00:28.737 --> 00:00:33.908 position:50% align:center
Like a red flower, coming into
full bloom. Absolutely stunning.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.706 position:50% align:center
Uh. So, um...

00:00:41.458 --> 00:00:43.835 position:50% align:center
[ORDINARY] What you were
telling us earlier--

00:00:43.918 --> 00:00:46.379 position:50% align:center
you weren't joking, right?

00:00:46.463 --> 00:00:50.967 position:50% align:center
I mean, we're really
going through with this?

00:00:51.051 --> 00:00:52.719 position:50% align:center
[BLACK CAT chuckles]

00:02:28.398 --> 00:02:30.316 position:50% align:center
[BLACK CAT]
Shall we begin?

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.068 position:50% align:center
I'm glad none of
you were killed,

00:02:32.152 --> 00:02:34.863 position:50% align:center
but that's veteran
Akudama for you.

00:02:34.946 --> 00:02:36.573 position:50% align:center
Whoa! Now ventriloquism?

00:02:36.656 --> 00:02:38.533 position:50% align:center
Is there anything you
can't do, Swindler?

00:02:38.616 --> 00:02:41.661 position:50% align:center
[ORDINARY] What?! It's not me,
the cat's talking on its own!

00:02:41.745 --> 00:02:44.080 position:50% align:center
I can hear some
distortion in its voice.

00:02:44.164 --> 00:02:46.291 position:50% align:center
Probably from a speaker,
is it a robot?

00:02:46.374 --> 00:02:47.500 position:50% align:center
Yeah that's a robot.

00:02:47.584 --> 00:02:50.420 position:50% align:center
What fools!
It's obviously a talking cat!

00:02:50.503 --> 00:02:52.964 position:50% align:center
[BLACK CAT] No. They are
correct. I am a robot.

00:02:53.048 --> 00:02:54.424 position:50% align:center
That's exactly what I just said!

00:02:54.507 --> 00:02:57.052 position:50% align:center
Let's put aside how the
cat's talking for a minute

00:02:57.135 --> 00:02:59.346 position:50% align:center
and agree it sounds like
they're running the show.

00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:01.598 position:50% align:center
So, are you the
mastermind or something?

00:03:01.681 --> 00:03:05.185 position:50% align:center
[BLACK CAT] You could say that.
This was phase one of the plan.

00:03:05.268 --> 00:03:08.271 position:50% align:center
Culminating in you receiving
your collar bombs.

00:03:08.355 --> 00:03:09.481 position:50% align:center
[HOODLUM]
Um, mister boss kitty,

00:03:09.564 --> 00:03:11.066 position:50% align:center
would you mind
removing mine, please?

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:13.651 position:50% align:center
There's still so much I want to
see in life, please let me live.

00:03:13.735 --> 00:03:16.363 position:50% align:center
[CUTTHROAT] Aw. That's no fun,
I just put it on you!

00:03:16.446 --> 00:03:17.781 position:50% align:center
I'd like mine removed, too.

00:03:17.864 --> 00:03:20.575 position:50% align:center
[BLACK CAT] Out of the question,
I'm afraid. I'll admit,

00:03:20.658 --> 00:03:23.661 position:50% align:center
the two of you weren't
included in the original plan.

00:03:23.745 --> 00:03:25.205 position:50% align:center
But the fact that
you're not dead yet

00:03:25.288 --> 00:03:28.708 position:50% align:center
is proof of your abilities,
so you're both coming along.

00:03:28.792 --> 00:03:29.793 position:50% align:center
Coming along?

00:03:29.876 --> 00:03:31.044 position:50% align:center
There's more?

00:03:31.127 --> 00:03:33.213 position:50% align:center
[BLACK CAT] I said this
was phase one, right?

00:03:33.296 --> 00:03:34.506 position:50% align:center
[COURIER]
Count me out.

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:36.841 position:50% align:center
I completed the job
that I was hired to do.

00:03:36.925 --> 00:03:39.302 position:50% align:center
Plus, I have no interest in
working with these shitheads.

00:03:39.386 --> 00:03:42.138 position:50% align:center
[BRAWLER] I ain't no shithead.
I'm a badass lone wolf!

00:03:42.222 --> 00:03:44.391 position:50% align:center
And wolves don't wear
no damn collars!

00:03:44.474 --> 00:03:46.851 position:50% align:center
[BLACK CAT] I suggest you
stop pulling at it.

00:03:46.935 --> 00:03:48.895 position:50% align:center
You'll have to forgive
the drastic measures,

00:03:48.978 --> 00:03:53.066 position:50% align:center
but reassurances were needed
to guarantee the job's success.

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:54.526 position:50% align:center
Rest assured,
you've been rewarded

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:57.946 position:50% align:center
for rescuing Cutthroat.
Check your balances.

00:03:58.029 --> 00:04:02.617 position:50% align:center
Huh? Uh.... That's
a whole lotta zeroes.

00:04:02.701 --> 00:04:04.619 position:50% align:center
It's a hundred million,
just like they said.

00:04:04.703 --> 00:04:05.954 position:50% align:center
A hundred mil, for real?

00:04:06.037 --> 00:04:07.622 position:50% align:center
Can I get a bite of that,
Mister Boss Kitty?

00:04:07.706 --> 00:04:10.000 position:50% align:center
Shouldn't it go to the one
who did the most work?

00:04:10.083 --> 00:04:13.128 position:50% align:center
[BLACK CAT ] I'm not concerned
about who performed the best.

00:04:13.211 --> 00:04:15.338 position:50% align:center
My only goal was to
observe and confirm

00:04:15.422 --> 00:04:17.382 position:50% align:center
your individual potential.

00:04:17.465 --> 00:04:19.509 position:50% align:center
[HACKER] In other words,
you were testing us.

00:04:19.592 --> 00:04:20.844 position:50% align:center
So how'd we do?

00:04:20.927 --> 00:04:22.595 position:50% align:center
[BLACK CAT]
Passed with flying colors.

00:04:22.679 --> 00:04:25.015 position:50% align:center
You're hired, as evidenced
by the deposit.

00:04:25.098 --> 00:04:26.725 position:50% align:center
You had mentioned a "phase one."

00:04:26.808 --> 00:04:29.602 position:50% align:center
How about some details
regarding the sequel.

00:04:29.686 --> 00:04:31.855 position:50% align:center
[BLACK CAT]
I was just getting to that.

00:04:31.938 --> 00:04:35.233 position:50% align:center
Not a single Akudama has ever
completed the second phase.

00:04:35.316 --> 00:04:36.943 position:50% align:center
Now that's what I like to hear!

00:04:37.027 --> 00:04:39.070 position:50% align:center
Quit stallin' and
tell us more already!

00:04:39.154 --> 00:04:41.865 position:50% align:center
[CUTTHROAT] Oooh, Does that mean
I get to make more red flowers?

00:04:41.948 --> 00:04:44.743 position:50% align:center
[HOODLUM] Hell yeah, there's a
hundred mill with my name on it!

00:04:44.826 --> 00:04:47.287 position:50% align:center
So what's the objective?

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.040 position:50% align:center
[BLACK CAT]
Attacking the Shinkansen.

00:04:50.123 --> 00:04:52.042 position:50% align:center
Wait. What did you say?

00:04:52.125 --> 00:04:54.002 position:50% align:center
We're talking about
some other Shinkansen

00:04:54.085 --> 00:04:55.503 position:50% align:center
I'm not aware of, right?

00:04:55.587 --> 00:04:57.339 position:50% align:center
[BLACK CAT]
Nope, the one and only.

00:04:57.422 --> 00:04:59.632 position:50% align:center
That's why I assembled you.

00:04:59.716 --> 00:05:01.593 position:50% align:center
[BRAWLER] Just when I
thought I'd done it all,

00:05:01.676 --> 00:05:04.637 position:50% align:center
a talking cat comes up with
something completely original!

00:05:04.721 --> 00:05:06.014 position:50% align:center
This is gonna be awesome!

00:05:06.097 --> 00:05:07.599 position:50% align:center
A target of faith.

00:05:07.682 --> 00:05:10.268 position:50% align:center
The sole connection between
Kanto and Kansai.

00:05:10.352 --> 00:05:13.521 position:50% align:center
Exactly! The Shinkansen!
This talking cat's insane!

00:05:13.605 --> 00:05:15.315 position:50% align:center
Countless people worship it!

00:05:15.398 --> 00:05:18.401 position:50% align:center
You always stay respectful,
that's like rule number one!

00:05:18.485 --> 00:05:19.277 position:50% align:center
We'll be cursed!

00:05:19.361 --> 00:05:21.780 position:50% align:center
The Shinkansen sure is pretty,

00:05:21.863 --> 00:05:23.615 position:50% align:center
and like a blade,
it's all shiny!

00:05:23.698 --> 00:05:26.159 position:50% align:center
Isn't this one a little
risky, even for us?

00:05:26.242 --> 00:05:28.620 position:50% align:center
[BLACK CAT]
The Shinkansen is man-made.

00:05:28.703 --> 00:05:30.830 position:50% align:center
It's nothing supernatural.

00:05:30.914 --> 00:05:35.210 position:50% align:center
What's the pay? This job.
How much is it paying?

00:05:35.293 --> 00:05:37.754 position:50% align:center
[BLACK CAT]
Hmph. A billion.

00:05:37.837 --> 00:05:39.339 position:50% align:center
[HOODLUM]
That was a 'B', right?!

00:05:39.422 --> 00:05:40.715 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR]
And what guarantee do we have

00:05:40.799 --> 00:05:41.841 position:50% align:center
that you'll pay that much?

00:05:41.925 --> 00:05:44.260 position:50% align:center
[BLACK CAT chuckles]
You have my word.

00:05:44.344 --> 00:05:45.804 position:50% align:center
After all, I'm no Swindler.

00:05:45.887 --> 00:05:46.721 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:46.805 --> 00:05:49.599 position:50% align:center
[GUARDS chattering]

00:05:49.683 --> 00:05:51.393 position:50% align:center
[BLACK CAT]
Sounds like we have company.

00:05:51.476 --> 00:05:55.063 position:50% align:center
Let's relocate.
I'll explain the rest there.

00:05:59.317 --> 00:06:01.820 position:50% align:center
[ORDINARY] All right. I've just
gotta go with the flow.

00:06:01.903 --> 00:06:04.239 position:50% align:center
[BRAWLER] Hey! Gettin'
real tired of waitin'

00:06:04.322 --> 00:06:05.949 position:50% align:center
for one of these shuttles
to stop for us!

00:06:06.032 --> 00:06:09.577 position:50% align:center
Can't blame them, nobody wants
to come to a place like this.

00:06:09.661 --> 00:06:11.162 position:50% align:center
[BLACK CAT] I thought this was
the fastest way

00:06:11.246 --> 00:06:14.624 position:50% align:center
to abandon factory I selected
for our rendezvous.

00:06:14.708 --> 00:06:17.335 position:50% align:center
We need to get our
hands on a ride, huh?

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:20.922 position:50% align:center
No choice but to get
their attention then!

00:06:21.006 --> 00:06:23.758 position:50% align:center
[gasps] What the...?

00:06:26.511 --> 00:06:28.179 position:50% align:center
'Ey...

00:06:28.263 --> 00:06:31.307 position:50% align:center
Ohh! That was totally sick!

00:06:31.391 --> 00:06:33.727 position:50% align:center
This dude's completely
frickin' nuts!

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:35.854 position:50% align:center
[DRIVER A screams]

00:06:35.937 --> 00:06:38.106 position:50% align:center
[BRAWLER] Yo, how am I supposed
to steer this thing?

00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:39.774 position:50% align:center
--[DOCTOR] How dumb.
--[COURIER] Shithead.

00:06:39.858 --> 00:06:41.985 position:50% align:center
But I love this kinda dumb shit!

00:06:42.068 --> 00:06:43.445 position:50% align:center
[HACKER] I've never played
with a bus before,

00:06:43.528 --> 00:06:45.739 position:50% align:center
but it might be fun.

00:06:50.744 --> 00:06:53.788 position:50% align:center
[BRAWLER] Oh, wait, never mind!
We good, I figured it out!

00:06:53.872 --> 00:06:55.457 position:50% align:center
--[COURIER] Shithead.
--[DOCTOR] Birdbrain.

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:58.209 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but he's our shitbrain!

00:07:10.847 --> 00:07:14.100 position:50% align:center
[CUTTHROAT laughs] Whoa, so
high! We're really flying!

00:07:14.184 --> 00:07:17.312 position:50% align:center
Man, what a primitive system.
Ugh, How boring.

00:07:17.395 --> 00:07:21.399 position:50% align:center
That jump was pretty slick!
You sir are a total monster!

00:07:21.483 --> 00:07:22.817 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:07:22.901 --> 00:07:25.320 position:50% align:center
Damn straight! 'Cause I'm
the world's best brawler,

00:07:25.403 --> 00:07:26.571 position:50% align:center
and don't you ever forget it!

00:07:26.654 --> 00:07:28.281 position:50% align:center
Yes! He's simple!

00:07:28.365 --> 00:07:30.575 position:50% align:center
'Ight spill, what are
you awesome at?

00:07:30.658 --> 00:07:32.118 position:50% align:center
What?

00:07:32.202 --> 00:07:33.828 position:50% align:center
[BRAWLER] They must've thrown
you in prison for somethin'.

00:07:33.912 --> 00:07:37.665 position:50% align:center
Uh! Oh, sure! Come on,
it's not like they lock you up

00:07:37.749 --> 00:07:40.001 position:50% align:center
in the prison's lowest
cells for nothin'!

00:07:40.085 --> 00:07:44.005 position:50% align:center
For my crimes, I was serving
a 500-million-year sentence!

00:07:44.089 --> 00:07:47.467 position:50% align:center
You serious? You must be
super strong then, brother!

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:48.843 position:50% align:center
What'd you do to
deserve that sentence?

00:07:48.927 --> 00:07:51.262 position:50% align:center
Well, Honestly I'm not
really at liberty

00:07:51.346 --> 00:07:52.847 position:50% align:center
to disclose any of the details,

00:07:52.931 --> 00:07:55.016 position:50% align:center
but I can assure you
that it was just as bad

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:56.559 position:50% align:center
as attacking the Shinkansen!

00:07:56.643 --> 00:07:58.395 position:50% align:center
I'm sitting beside a legend!

00:07:58.478 --> 00:08:02.691 position:50% align:center
Five hundred million
years, let's go!

00:08:02.774 --> 00:08:06.653 position:50% align:center
[CUTTHROAT laughing]

00:08:06.736 --> 00:08:09.989 position:50% align:center
Wow, 500 million,
huh? Impressive.

00:08:10.073 --> 00:08:11.408 position:50% align:center
Hell, yeah!

00:08:11.491 --> 00:08:14.577 position:50% align:center
[HOODLUM] Aw, shucks.
You're too kind, Miss Swindler

00:08:14.661 --> 00:08:18.957 position:50% align:center
[gasping] Look at all
the red lights! So pretty.

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.793 position:50% align:center
Hey, think I can bum
a smoke off ya?

00:08:21.876 --> 00:08:25.547 position:50% align:center
C'mon if you give me one,
I'll let you have a go.

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:26.506 position:50% align:center
No thanks.

00:08:26.589 --> 00:08:29.342 position:50% align:center
What, am I not your type?

00:08:31.177 --> 00:08:37.934 position:50% align:center
Oooh. Pretty red button!
Look! Another! Red! Red! Red!

00:08:38.018 --> 00:08:40.020 position:50% align:center
Dude, that's for emergencies!

00:08:40.103 --> 00:08:42.439 position:50% align:center
Ohh! Everything's red!

00:08:42.522 --> 00:08:44.816 position:50% align:center
[VOICE]
Emergency! Emergency!

00:08:44.899 --> 00:08:48.653 position:50% align:center

You're watching a super special

00:09:38.286 --> 00:09:40.955 position:50% align:center
all about the fascinating
history of Kansai!

00:09:41.039 --> 00:09:45.043 position:50% align:center
And the best part is, it airs
23 times a day, every day!

[BUNNY] Question for ya,
Sharkie!

00:09:46.628 --> 00:09:48.296 position:50% align:center
You've heard about Kanto, right?

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:51.132 position:50% align:center
[SHARK] Duh! Everyone
knows Kanto's a utopia

00:09:51.216 --> 00:09:54.219 position:50% align:center
to the east where all the gods
and important people live!

00:09:54.302 --> 00:09:57.055 position:50% align:center
[BUNNY] Uh-huh, Uh-huh!
Then, how about Kansai?

00:09:57.138 --> 00:09:58.515 position:50% align:center
[SHARK]
Just take a look around!

00:09:58.598 --> 00:10:00.934 position:50% align:center

we're living right now!

each ward is unique?

00:10:03.019 --> 00:10:04.354 position:50% align:center
[BUNNY]
Ooh, tell me about it!

00:10:04.437 --> 00:10:06.272 position:50% align:center
[SHARK] Well, the South
is notorious for being

00:10:06.356 --> 00:10:07.816 position:50% align:center
overrun with criminals!

00:10:07.899 --> 00:10:10.527 position:50% align:center
Whereas most of the middle class
live in the central region!

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:13.738 position:50% align:center
Then you have the wealthy,
who reside over in the north!

00:10:13.822 --> 00:10:16.616 position:50% align:center
If you're looking for the fancy
houses and businesses,

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:18.076 position:50% align:center
that's where you'll find them!

00:10:18.159 --> 00:10:21.538 position:50% align:center
[BUNNY] You betcha! Boy,
I wish I could live up North!

00:10:21.621 --> 00:10:24.541 position:50% align:center
[SHARK] But because of a war
a long, long time ago,

00:10:24.624 --> 00:10:26.918 position:50% align:center
most of Kansai was
burnt to the ground!

00:10:27.002 --> 00:10:28.753 position:50% align:center
[BUNNY] That happened when
Kanto dropped a new kind

00:10:28.837 --> 00:10:29.963 position:50% align:center
of bomb on it!

00:10:30.046 --> 00:10:31.548 position:50% align:center
[SHARK]
After losing the war,

00:10:31.631 --> 00:10:33.842 position:50% align:center
Kansai was on the
verge of collapse!

00:10:33.925 --> 00:10:37.012 position:50% align:center
But believe it or not,
just when all hope was lost,

00:10:37.095 --> 00:10:39.556 position:50% align:center
Kanto extended
a helping hand.

00:10:39.639 --> 00:10:41.057 position:50% align:center
[BUNNY]
Once Kansai was rebuilt,

00:10:41.141 --> 00:10:42.851 position:50% align:center
the people were
eternally grateful

00:10:42.934 --> 00:10:46.312 position:50% align:center
for the kindness bestowed on
them and began to revere Kanto!

00:10:46.396 --> 00:10:48.023 position:50% align:center
[SHARK] We're so thankful!

00:10:48.106 --> 00:10:51.860 position:50% align:center
As long as Kanto guides us,
everything will be fine!

00:10:51.943 --> 00:10:54.654 position:50% align:center
[BUNNY, SHARK]
Well, until next time!

Yeah, Thank you, um... Mister?

[CUTTHROAT]
Please, call me Cutthroat.

00:11:26.895 --> 00:11:29.022 position:50% align:center
Uh. All right, Mister Cutthroat.

00:11:29.105 --> 00:11:31.816 position:50% align:center
Admittedly, pink's not
a terrible color.

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:34.444 position:50% align:center
You do get it from mixing
red with white, after all.

00:11:34.527 --> 00:11:35.862 position:50% align:center
[ORDINARY]
Huh...?

00:11:35.945 --> 00:11:37.947 position:50% align:center
However, red would be a far
more vivid color choice.

00:11:38.031 --> 00:11:39.616 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:39.699 --> 00:11:42.243 position:50% align:center

I'm completely average!

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:48.500 position:50% align:center
It's settled. You're mine.

00:11:48.583 --> 00:11:50.752 position:50% align:center
And I won't let anybody
else have you!

00:11:50.835 --> 00:11:53.380 position:50% align:center
Uhh! Please don't take
this the wrong way,

00:11:53.463 --> 00:11:56.424 position:50% align:center
but it's been less than 24 hours
since we met and we barely

00:11:56.508 --> 00:11:58.468 position:50% align:center
even know each other! And no
offense, It just feels like...

00:11:58.551 --> 00:12:01.388 position:50% align:center
Honestly not bad for
some "abandoned factory."

00:12:07.811 --> 00:12:09.729 position:50% align:center
Or maybe it just
doesn't give a crap.

00:12:09.813 --> 00:12:11.731 position:50% align:center
I found a sweet room!

00:12:11.815 --> 00:12:13.775 position:50% align:center
And I mean that literally,
we got us a suite!

00:12:13.858 --> 00:12:16.069 position:50% align:center
In that case, seems a
criminal of my stature

00:12:16.152 --> 00:12:17.362 position:50% align:center
should take the royal suite!

Some people think blood's
good for the skin,

00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:16.588 position:50% align:center
but that's a misconception.

00:13:16.671 --> 00:13:18.089 position:50% align:center
[ORDINARY]
The real misconception here

00:13:18.173 --> 00:13:20.759 position:50% align:center
is your concept of boundaries!

00:13:20.842 --> 00:13:23.428 position:50% align:center
[BLACK CAT] Finally, we can
have a relaxed discussion.

00:13:23.511 --> 00:13:25.347 position:50% align:center
Stop jerkin' us around.

What makes this job
worth a billion?

00:13:28.141 --> 00:13:31.728 position:50% align:center
[BLACK CAT] Let's dive right
into the details, then.

00:13:31.811 --> 00:13:34.814 position:50% align:center
As I'm sure you're all
aware, the Shinkansen

00:13:34.898 --> 00:13:38.151 position:50% align:center
is the sole passage connecting
Kansai and Kanto.

00:13:38.234 --> 00:13:40.820 position:50% align:center
And goods from the Kyushu Plant
are exported from here

00:13:40.904 --> 00:13:42.572 position:50% align:center
via Kansai Station.

00:13:42.655 --> 00:13:44.366 position:50% align:center
What's the Kyushu Plant?

00:13:44.449 --> 00:13:45.575 position:50% align:center
[BLACK CAT]
Interesting.

00:13:45.658 --> 00:13:47.577 position:50% align:center
I figured you
would've heard of it.

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:51.414 position:50% align:center
The Kyushu Plant is a
research city run by Kanto.

00:13:51.498 --> 00:13:54.459 position:50% align:center
All of the world's Kanto
products are manufactured there.

00:13:54.542 --> 00:13:58.380 position:50% align:center
That includes items like
Courier's bike for example.

00:13:58.463 --> 00:14:00.882 position:50% align:center
Your job is to steal a
particular piece of cargo

00:14:00.965 --> 00:14:02.467 position:50% align:center
off of the Shinkansen.

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:04.052 position:50% align:center
[HACKER]
What, specifically?

00:14:04.135 --> 00:14:07.180 position:50% align:center
[BLACK CAT] A 1.5-meter vault
located in the front carriage.

00:14:07.263 --> 00:14:09.015 position:50% align:center
Okay, and inside is...?

00:14:09.099 --> 00:14:10.767 position:50% align:center
[BLACK CAT]
That is none of your concern.

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:13.186 position:50% align:center
The contents are
irrelevant to the plan.

00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:14.562 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR grunts]

00:14:14.646 --> 00:14:17.232 position:50% align:center
[BLACK CAT] Needless to say,
Kansai Station is one of

00:14:17.315 --> 00:14:19.859 position:50% align:center
the most heavily
guarded places around.

00:14:19.943 --> 00:14:21.069 position:50% align:center
It's right up there

00:14:21.152 --> 00:14:23.613 position:50% align:center
with the Kansai Central
Information Bureau,

00:14:23.697 --> 00:14:25.782 position:50% align:center
otherwise known
as the Seal Center.

00:14:25.865 --> 00:14:27.283 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR]
The Seal Center?

00:14:27.367 --> 00:14:29.494 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's where all of
the information in Kansai

00:14:29.577 --> 00:14:32.872 position:50% align:center
is managed! I'm there
pretty regularly.

00:14:32.956 --> 00:14:34.916 position:50% align:center
You continue to
impress me, Swindler.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.127 position:50% align:center
Not even I could break
through their defenses.

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:39.254 position:50% align:center
[ORDINARY]
Uh. Oh! Y-Yeah?

00:14:39.337 --> 00:14:41.589 position:50% align:center
Crazy, It's actually
kinda simple for me.

00:14:41.673 --> 00:14:44.300 position:50% align:center
One guard or a hundred,
doesn't make a difference to me.

00:14:44.384 --> 00:14:47.137 position:50% align:center
Once I'm in, barreling down
the hall, they're done for.

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:49.597 position:50% align:center
[BLACK CAT] The Shinkansen
stops at Kansai Station

00:14:49.681 --> 00:14:51.558 position:50% align:center
for a mere 20 minutes.

00:14:51.641 --> 00:14:54.769 position:50% align:center
I selected all of you because
of the complexity of the job.

00:14:54.853 --> 00:14:56.146 position:50% align:center
Screw that.

00:14:56.229 --> 00:15:00.191 position:50% align:center
Gimme 20 minutes and I'll
get the gig done myself.

00:15:00.275 --> 00:15:02.110 position:50% align:center
Hey, yo, how long's
20 minutes again?

00:15:02.193 --> 00:15:03.820 position:50% align:center
Shorter than you think,
believe me.

00:15:03.903 --> 00:15:06.698 position:50% align:center
So, in order to infiltrate
and secure the loot,

00:15:06.781 --> 00:15:09.492 position:50% align:center
we need to demonstrate our
respective abilities to the max.

00:15:09.576 --> 00:15:13.079 position:50% align:center
[BLACK CAT] That's right.
Kansai Station is impenetrable.

00:15:13.163 --> 00:15:16.374 position:50% align:center
Various security
measures lie inside.

00:15:16.458 --> 00:15:18.543 position:50% align:center
And even if you manage
to reach the platform,

00:15:18.626 --> 00:15:21.671 position:50% align:center
the Shinkansen has
no doors or windows.

00:15:21.755 --> 00:15:25.675 position:50% align:center
There's only way inside, and
that's through the cargo hold.

00:15:25.759 --> 00:15:28.011 position:50% align:center
However, any
unregistered objects

00:15:28.094 --> 00:15:30.430 position:50% align:center
are immediately fried
by a plasma shield.

00:15:30.513 --> 00:15:31.973 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR]
Let's face the facts,

00:15:32.057 --> 00:15:34.351 position:50% align:center
based off what've you've told
us, this sounds impossible.

00:15:34.434 --> 00:15:36.978 position:50% align:center
[BRAWLER] I hear ya, we go in,
I knock it off the tracks

00:15:37.062 --> 00:15:38.688 position:50% align:center
with a single punch, job's done.

00:15:38.772 --> 00:15:40.482 position:50% align:center
[BLACK CAT]
Unfortunately, it's secured

00:15:40.565 --> 00:15:42.650 position:50% align:center
with a top-notch counter
and defense system.

00:15:42.734 --> 00:15:45.653 position:50% align:center
Then we'll just have
Hacker work his magic on it.

00:15:45.737 --> 00:15:48.114 position:50% align:center
But I suppose that's
a no-go as well?

00:15:48.198 --> 00:15:49.449 position:50% align:center
[BLACK CAT]
As you've surmised,

00:15:49.532 --> 00:15:52.494 position:50% align:center
the Shinkansen can't be
accessed externally.

00:15:52.577 --> 00:15:56.664 position:50% align:center
And even if you make it inside,
you'll only have ten minutes

00:15:56.748 --> 00:15:59.626 position:50% align:center
