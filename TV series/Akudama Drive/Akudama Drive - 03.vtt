[BOSS]
Would you care to explain to me

00:00:10.176 --> 00:00:13.013 position:50% align:center
how you managed to let
the Akudama escape?

00:00:13.096 --> 00:00:14.222 position:50% align:center
It was all my fault!

00:00:14.305 --> 00:00:15.640 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry,
my inexperience held us--

00:00:15.724 --> 00:00:17.976 position:50% align:center
[MASTER] No excuse
can pardon our failure.

00:00:18.059 --> 00:00:19.853 position:50% align:center
We won't let you down next time.

00:00:19.936 --> 00:00:21.396 position:50% align:center
[BOSS]
See that you don't.

00:00:21.479 --> 00:00:25.650 position:50% align:center
As Executioners, it's our duty
to rid society of the dregs.

00:00:25.734 --> 00:00:27.485 position:50% align:center
[MASTER]
We understand.

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:29.696 position:50% align:center
Admonishment aside,
there's no denying

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:32.323 position:50% align:center
they've formed quite
the group this time.

00:00:32.407 --> 00:00:34.284 position:50% align:center
Akudama have been known
to work together,

00:00:34.367 --> 00:00:37.579 position:50% align:center
but rarely so many
of this caliber.

00:00:37.662 --> 00:00:39.539 position:50% align:center
You're going to need backup.

00:00:39.622 --> 00:00:41.207 position:50% align:center
[MASTER]
That won't be necessary.

00:00:41.291 --> 00:00:44.753 position:50% align:center
As I've already said:
Next time, we won't fail you.

00:00:44.836 --> 00:00:47.881 position:50% align:center
Not I, nor my partner.

00:00:49.716 --> 00:00:53.094 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Moving on,

00:00:53.178 --> 00:00:56.848 position:50% align:center
do we know what sort of chaos
these criminals are planning?

00:00:56.931 --> 00:00:59.601 position:50% align:center
[MASTER] About that, we were
able to recover some

00:00:59.684 --> 00:01:02.354 position:50% align:center
useful information at the hotel.

00:02:41.077 --> 00:02:43.288 position:50% align:center
It's too dark to read
a damn thing.

00:02:43.371 --> 00:02:45.790 position:50% align:center
Hey, Hacker sweetie.
Lend me a hand?

00:02:45.874 --> 00:02:47.375 position:50% align:center
Not happening.

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.669 position:50% align:center
[HOODLUM] That's nothin'!
I can do a hundred in a second!

00:02:49.753 --> 00:02:52.589 position:50% align:center
[BRAWLER] You know I'm not about
to lose to you, watch me!

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:55.925 position:50% align:center
[BRAWLER]
Hey! Look! Are you seein' this?

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:58.345 position:50% align:center
What number am I at--200, 205?

00:02:58.428 --> 00:02:59.679 position:50% align:center
What's after 205?

00:02:59.763 --> 00:03:01.890 position:50% align:center
[BLACK CAT] I'd like to
go over the mission again.

00:03:01.973 --> 00:03:03.808 position:50% align:center
Swindler. Move in closer.

00:03:03.892 --> 00:03:07.854 position:50% align:center
[ORDINARY]
Uh... Sure thing.

00:03:07.937 --> 00:03:09.689 position:50% align:center
[BLACK CAT]
To recap, I've assembled you all

00:03:09.773 --> 00:03:13.068 position:50% align:center
to steal the vault in the
Shinkansen's front carriage.

00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:15.153 position:50% align:center
[HOODLUM laughs]
The big score.

00:03:15.236 --> 00:03:17.364 position:50% align:center
If that's not worth a billion,
I dunno what is!

00:03:17.447 --> 00:03:21.326 position:50% align:center
C'mon, you gonna start talkin'
or what Mr. Kitty, let's go!

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:24.788 position:50% align:center
[BLACK CAT] Fine. The only way
to board the Shinkansen

00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:27.707 position:50% align:center
is through Kansai Station.

00:03:27.791 --> 00:03:30.126 position:50% align:center
The transport will stop
for 20 minutes.

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.504 position:50% align:center
During that time,
the station's security

00:03:32.587 --> 00:03:35.340 position:50% align:center
is disabled while
goods are loaded.

00:03:35.423 --> 00:03:36.841 position:50% align:center
And that small window is when

00:03:36.925 --> 00:03:39.969 position:50% align:center
its so-called impenetrable
defenses are rendered useless.

00:03:40.053 --> 00:03:43.932 position:50% align:center
[BLACK CAT] Exactly. Operations
are typically run by robots,

00:03:44.015 --> 00:03:46.017 position:50% align:center
but as soon as
loading commences,

00:03:46.101 --> 00:03:48.019 position:50% align:center
humans take their place.

00:03:48.103 --> 00:03:51.981 position:50% align:center
The target arrives tomorrow
at exactly 1900 hours.

00:03:52.065 --> 00:03:55.360 position:50% align:center
Within that train is our
objective, the vault.

00:03:55.443 --> 00:03:57.654 position:50% align:center
So to summarize we've
only got 20 minutes

00:03:57.737 --> 00:03:59.989 position:50% align:center
to infiltrate the station,
board the Shinkansen,

00:04:00.073 --> 00:04:01.157 position:50% align:center
and then steal the vault.

00:04:01.241 --> 00:04:03.660 position:50% align:center
Wha-- 20 minutes,
is that even possible?

00:04:03.743 --> 00:04:06.287 position:50% align:center
Yeah, piece of cake, just stay
out of my way and we'll be good.

00:04:06.371 --> 00:04:08.289 position:50% align:center
Now, don't you worry
'bout the others, bro.

00:04:08.373 --> 00:04:09.833 position:50% align:center
I can keep 'em wrangled for you.

00:04:09.916 --> 00:04:12.043 position:50% align:center
[BRAWLER] Hell yeah,
my guy knows what's up!

00:04:12.127 --> 00:04:13.086 position:50% align:center
I knew you were special.

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:14.796 position:50% align:center
Can't we get in
through the tracks?

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:18.049 position:50% align:center
[BLACK CAT] While that would
be ideal, an electromagnetic

00:04:18.133 --> 00:04:21.720 position:50% align:center
barrier blocks the way.
So that's impossible.

00:04:21.803 --> 00:04:25.306 position:50% align:center
Nice try, though, Courier.
"A" for effort.

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:28.351 position:50% align:center
Step one is going to be
getting through the gate.

00:04:28.435 --> 00:04:31.438 position:50% align:center
Once you're safely inside,
the Shinkansen's platform

00:04:31.521 --> 00:04:33.523 position:50% align:center
can be reached by
taking the elevator.

00:04:33.606 --> 00:04:35.775 position:50% align:center
That sounds easier
than I expected.

00:04:35.859 --> 00:04:37.318 position:50% align:center
[BLACK CAT]
Of course it sounds simple

00:04:37.402 --> 00:04:38.820 position:50% align:center
to someone like you, Swindler.

00:04:38.903 --> 00:04:40.321 position:50% align:center
[ORDINARY]
Uh! Um!

00:04:40.405 --> 00:04:43.199 position:50% align:center
This elevator, it's got a
two-button start system, right?

00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:45.744 position:50% align:center
[BLACK CAT] Precisely.
To call it, both buttons

00:04:45.827 --> 00:04:48.288 position:50% align:center
must be pressed at
the exact same time.

00:04:48.371 --> 00:04:51.750 position:50% align:center
One of them's upstairs while the
other one is in the basement.

00:04:51.833 --> 00:04:53.918 position:50% align:center
Oh man, talk about
a tricky set-up.

00:04:54.002 --> 00:04:55.962 position:50% align:center
--Yeah, absolutely.
--What?

00:04:56.046 --> 00:04:59.883 position:50% align:center
Not like I didn't expect it to
be near impossible or anything!

00:04:59.966 --> 00:05:02.302 position:50% align:center
[BLACK CAT] We will be split
into three groups.

00:05:02.385 --> 00:05:05.889 position:50% align:center
Group A, which includes
Swindler, Cutthroat, and Hacker,

00:05:05.972 --> 00:05:07.807 position:50% align:center
will push the upstairs button.

00:05:07.891 --> 00:05:10.810 position:50% align:center
Group B comprised of Doctor,
Brawler, and Hoodlum

00:05:10.894 --> 00:05:12.812 position:50% align:center
will push the one
in the basement.

00:05:12.896 --> 00:05:14.189 position:50% align:center
Courier will work alone.

00:05:14.272 --> 00:05:16.900 position:50% align:center
[CUTTHROAT] Yay, I get to be
paired up with Swindler!

00:05:16.983 --> 00:05:19.611 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR] Don't you feel like
the teams are a little uneven?

00:05:19.694 --> 00:05:21.112 position:50% align:center
[BRAWLER]
Damn straight, they are!

00:05:21.196 --> 00:05:23.656 position:50% align:center
You think that bundle of twigs
can really pull this off?

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.242 position:50% align:center
[HOODLUM]
Here's hoping y'all don't die!

00:05:26.326 --> 00:05:29.996 position:50% align:center
[BLACK CAT] I divided the teams
equally. I believe they're fine.

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.166 position:50% align:center
Making your way to the platform
is just the beginning.

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:35.960 position:50% align:center
The Shinkansen's hold is
equipped with a plasma field

00:05:36.044 --> 00:05:38.797 position:50% align:center
that incinerates any
unregistered cargo.

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:39.964 position:50% align:center
Yikes.

00:05:40.048 --> 00:05:42.175 position:50% align:center
We're gonna need my bike
to move the vault.

00:05:42.258 --> 00:05:45.011 position:50% align:center
So how does it get on board
the train in one piece?

00:05:45.095 --> 00:05:46.471 position:50% align:center
[BLACK CAT]
Good question.

00:05:46.554 --> 00:05:48.431 position:50% align:center
I brought something from
the Kyushu Plant along

00:05:48.515 --> 00:05:52.644 position:50% align:center
to solve that. Anyway,
to get aboard the Shinkansen,

00:05:52.727 --> 00:05:53.978 position:50% align:center
Hacker will need to modify

00:05:54.062 --> 00:05:57.691 position:50% align:center
a shipping crate's registration
and climb inside.

00:05:57.774 --> 00:05:59.901 position:50% align:center
He'll enter the train
as a piece of cargo,

00:05:59.984 --> 00:06:03.279 position:50% align:center
and once inside, he turns
off the plasma shield.

00:06:03.363 --> 00:06:06.157 position:50% align:center
Interesting. A task only
doable by someone of

00:06:06.241 --> 00:06:09.202 position:50% align:center
a small stature such as myself.
Good thinking.

00:06:09.285 --> 00:06:11.371 position:50% align:center
[BLACK CAT] Once the shield's
down, everyone will board

00:06:11.454 --> 00:06:15.291 position:50% align:center
the vessel. But be warned, the
security inside is a mystery.

00:06:15.375 --> 00:06:17.210 position:50% align:center
Not even I know what awaits you.

00:06:17.293 --> 00:06:19.838 position:50% align:center
So you're saying it could be
even more dangerous

00:06:19.921 --> 00:06:21.423 position:50% align:center
than what we've already done?

00:06:21.506 --> 00:06:24.718 position:50% align:center
[BLACK CAT] The Shinkansen is
the only way of reaching Kanto.

00:06:24.801 --> 00:06:28.221 position:50% align:center
We may be faced with obstacles
beyond our imagination.

00:06:28.304 --> 00:06:30.306 position:50% align:center
Yeah, yeah, whatever
kinda guards they got,

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:33.893 position:50% align:center
I'll bulldoze right through 'em.
Hell, the stronger the better!

00:06:33.977 --> 00:06:36.521 position:50% align:center
[BLACK CAT] One problem with
that. The moment there are

00:06:36.604 --> 00:06:40.900 position:50% align:center
any changes to a guards' vitals,
the alarm will sound.

00:06:40.984 --> 00:06:43.945 position:50% align:center
In other words, there
has to be zero casualties.

00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:45.572 position:50% align:center
[BLACK CAT]
Correct.

00:06:45.655 --> 00:06:46.823 position:50% align:center
[BRAWLER]
Gah, What the hell!

00:06:46.906 --> 00:06:48.742 position:50% align:center
Why even bother going
to such a boring place!

00:06:48.825 --> 00:06:51.745 position:50% align:center
Slow your roll, Brother. I've
heard some crazy rumors.

00:06:51.828 --> 00:06:55.498 position:50% align:center
They say Kansai Station houses
a guard as strong as a demon.

00:06:55.582 --> 00:06:57.292 position:50% align:center
Now we're talkin'! Never mind!

00:06:57.375 --> 00:06:58.835 position:50% align:center
So dumb.

00:06:58.918 --> 00:07:00.587 position:50% align:center
--[COURIER] Freakin' shithead.
--[HACKER] Meat for brains.

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:03.506 position:50% align:center
[yawns] What's wrong, Swindler?

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:05.300 position:50% align:center
[BRAWLER] Hey, I dunno why,
but my left fist...

00:07:05.383 --> 00:07:06.634 position:50% align:center
[BLACK CAT]
Swindler?

00:07:06.718 --> 00:07:08.428 position:50% align:center
What? Sorry?

00:07:08.511 --> 00:07:09.929 position:50% align:center
[BLACK CAT]
Something on your mind?

00:07:10.013 --> 00:07:11.389 position:50% align:center
No! I'm cool!

00:07:11.473 --> 00:07:14.017 position:50% align:center
It's a flawless plan and
nothin' could go wrong!

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:16.686 position:50% align:center
[laughs nervously]

00:07:21.274 --> 00:07:23.985 position:50% align:center
[ORDINARY] This just keeps
getting worse and worse.

00:07:24.069 --> 00:07:27.822 position:50% align:center
At this rate,
I'll become a real Akudama.

00:07:27.906 --> 00:07:30.241 position:50% align:center
Not like I can run away.

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:43.046 position:50% align:center
How'd I get here? It feels
like I've strayed so far.

00:07:45.715 --> 00:07:49.469 position:50% align:center
Man, it's so cold! Brrr!

00:07:49.552 --> 00:07:52.013 position:50% align:center
[BRAWLER] Who would've thought
the two of us would get along?

00:07:52.097 --> 00:07:53.139 position:50% align:center
Quite the duo, aren't we?

00:07:53.223 --> 00:07:57.060 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:07:57.143 --> 00:08:02.315 position:50% align:center
Even though they're Akudama,
they act kinda normal.

00:08:02.399 --> 00:08:03.358 position:50% align:center
[COURIER]
You're in the way.

00:08:03.441 --> 00:08:05.985 position:50% align:center
Didn't see you there.

00:08:06.069 --> 00:08:10.907 position:50% align:center
Hey, uh, Courier, what made
you start delivering stuff?

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:12.325 position:50% align:center
Uh. Sorry!

00:08:12.409 --> 00:08:14.786 position:50% align:center
That's kinda nosey of me,
it's none of my business!

00:08:14.869 --> 00:08:17.497 position:50% align:center
Forget I even asked you!

00:08:18.498 --> 00:08:19.916 position:50% align:center
[COURIER]
It's where I belong.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.876 position:50% align:center
What?

00:08:24.295 --> 00:08:25.922 position:50% align:center
[ORDINARY]
Belong...?

00:08:29.968 --> 00:08:31.886 position:50% align:center
[BUNNY] Hello! It's your pal,
Bunny, again!

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:34.264 position:50% align:center
[SHARK]
And Shark! Miss us?

00:08:34.347 --> 00:08:36.016 position:50% align:center
[BUNNY]
Sharkie! Hey! Hey! Sharkie!

00:08:36.099 --> 00:08:38.768 position:50% align:center
You know about the
Execution Department, right?

00:08:38.852 --> 00:08:40.270 position:50% align:center
[SHARK]
For those who don't know,

00:08:40.353 --> 00:08:43.732 position:50% align:center
the Execution Department is
Kansai's elite police force!

00:08:43.815 --> 00:08:45.108 position:50% align:center
They have special abilities

00:08:45.191 --> 00:08:47.944 position:50% align:center
when it comes to investigating
those evil Akudama.

00:08:48.028 --> 00:08:49.446 position:50% align:center
Like deciding their sentences

00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:52.699 position:50% align:center
and sometimes even executing
them right on the spot!

00:08:52.782 --> 00:08:55.452 position:50% align:center
To recap: one, they're an
elite group of soldiers.

00:08:55.535 --> 00:08:58.288 position:50% align:center
Two, they serve as
investigator and judge!

00:08:58.371 --> 00:09:00.290 position:50% align:center
[BUNNY]
Uh-huh, uh-huh-- Oh!

00:09:00.373 --> 00:09:02.751 position:50% align:center
And they're usually split
into two-man teams

00:09:02.834 --> 00:09:04.753 position:50% align:center
who work for the big boss lady!

00:09:04.836 --> 00:09:07.630 position:50% align:center
And while lots of 'em like to
put their combat skills to use,

00:09:07.714 --> 00:09:09.883 position:50% align:center
some specialize in covert ops,

00:09:09.966 --> 00:09:12.677 position:50% align:center
like infiltration and
going deep undercover!

00:09:12.761 --> 00:09:14.179 position:50% align:center
[SHARK]
That's incredible!

00:09:14.262 --> 00:09:18.475 position:50% align:center
With them around, peace in
Kansai isn't going anywhere!

00:09:18.558 --> 00:09:21.603 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Well, until next time!

00:09:43.541 --> 00:09:46.753 position:50% align:center
Good Evening.
Billiken Transport.

00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:50.090 position:50% align:center
[BLACK CAT]
All right, let's discuss

00:09:50.173 --> 00:09:52.884 position:50% align:center
some of the finer
details of the plan.

00:09:52.967 --> 00:09:56.304 position:50% align:center
First off, we have to
slip into Kansai Station.

00:09:56.388 --> 00:09:59.516 position:50% align:center
A human guard will be standing
at the front gate.

00:09:59.599 --> 00:10:02.602 position:50% align:center
The seal he carries
is our key inside.

00:10:02.686 --> 00:10:07.148 position:50% align:center
And that's why I am assigning
this job to you, Swindler.

00:10:07.232 --> 00:10:08.274 position:50% align:center
[ORDINARY]
Mm.

00:10:08.358 --> 00:10:11.319 position:50% align:center
Pull on through. Hold on.

00:10:11.403 --> 00:10:13.196 position:50% align:center
You're not the usual
lady, are you?

00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:19.577 position:50% align:center
Yeah, she um, came down with
something, so I'm covering.

00:10:30.922 --> 00:10:34.009 position:50% align:center
Oh. Is that so? You tell her
to get well soon for me!

00:10:34.092 --> 00:10:36.094 position:50% align:center
Right. I'll let her know.

00:10:36.177 --> 00:10:39.097 position:50% align:center
I'm sure she'll
appreciate your concern.

00:10:46.312 --> 00:10:47.772 position:50% align:center
[BLACK CAT]
Once you're past the gate,

00:10:47.856 --> 00:10:50.692 position:50% align:center
you'll have to sneak through
the main entrance.

00:10:50.775 --> 00:10:54.362 position:50% align:center
That requires hijacking the
camera feed and alarms.

00:10:54.446 --> 00:10:57.073 position:50% align:center
Easy enough for you, Hacker.

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:04.080 position:50% align:center
--Weird.
--Huh?

00:11:05.331 --> 00:11:08.501 position:50% align:center
We're in. You gotta hand it
to Kansai Station.

00:11:08.585 --> 00:11:11.254 position:50% align:center
Their security system's
state of the art.

00:11:11.338 --> 00:11:12.589 position:50% align:center
The coast is clear for now,

00:11:12.672 --> 00:11:14.799 position:50% align:center
but we can't afford
to screw around.

00:11:14.883 --> 00:11:16.343 position:50% align:center
[beeping]

00:11:19.137 --> 00:11:23.058 position:50% align:center
Whoa! Unreal!

00:11:23.141 --> 00:11:26.227 position:50% align:center
This is way fancy for a place
a train passes through.

00:11:26.311 --> 00:11:29.564 position:50% align:center
[HACKER] That's because Kansai
Station is operated by Kanto.

00:11:29.647 --> 00:11:31.524 position:50% align:center
Honestly, I have
a lot of questions.

00:11:31.608 --> 00:11:34.944 position:50% align:center
Like why does the Shinkansen
stop here? Or what's inside?

00:11:35.028 --> 00:11:37.614 position:50% align:center
Most people don't even know
why it runs in first place.

00:11:37.697 --> 00:11:41.242 position:50% align:center
It's like some mythic black box
that people ended up praying to.

00:11:41.326 --> 00:11:42.577 position:50% align:center
Exciting stuff.

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:44.746 position:50% align:center
Exciting? You think so?

00:11:44.829 --> 00:11:47.499 position:50% align:center
Absolutely. I find it
all quite fascinating.

00:11:47.582 --> 00:11:49.626 position:50% align:center
I've heard Kanto is
a flawless utopia

00:11:49.709 --> 00:11:54.339 position:50% align:center
and that any other place
pales in comparison to it.

00:11:54.422 --> 00:11:56.841 position:50% align:center
One of these days I'm gonna
see it for myself,

00:11:56.925 --> 00:11:59.427 position:50% align:center
and get out of this
scrapheap for good.

00:11:59.511 --> 00:12:03.932 position:50% align:center
Wait, you want to go to Kanto?
Didn't expect that.

00:12:06.851 --> 00:12:08.520 position:50% align:center
Over there.

00:12:10.772 --> 00:12:12.565 position:50% align:center
All right.
We've got five minutes

00:12:12.649 --> 00:12:14.901 position:50% align:center
to press the button upstairs.

00:12:17.112 --> 00:12:19.406 position:50% align:center
[GUARD E snores]

00:12:19.489 --> 00:12:23.368 position:50% align:center
Now. Let's head on down
to the basement, shall we?

00:12:23.451 --> 00:12:26.329 position:50% align:center
[ORDINARY] Guys, wait.
Lemme catch my breath.

00:12:26.413 --> 00:12:28.164 position:50% align:center
[CUTTHROAT]
You're so slow, Swindler!

00:12:28.248 --> 00:12:30.041 position:50% align:center
[HACKER] What are you
doing down there?

00:12:30.125 --> 00:12:32.544 position:50% align:center
Are you seriously pretending
you're out of shape?

00:12:32.627 --> 00:12:34.963 position:50% align:center
Come on, I'm not falling for any
more of your swindler tricks!

00:12:35.046 --> 00:12:37.132 position:50% align:center
Stupid flying jerk.

00:12:37.215 --> 00:12:38.967 position:50% align:center
[BLACK CAT] Understand?
The only way of reaching

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:42.429 position:50% align:center
the Shinkansen platform
is by taking the elevator.

00:12:42.512 --> 00:12:44.556 position:50% align:center
Basically, we have to
coordinate pressing

00:12:44.639 --> 00:12:47.308 position:50% align:center
the up and downstairs
buttons simultaneously.

00:12:47.392 --> 00:12:48.476 position:50% align:center
[BLACK CAT]
That's right.

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:49.644 position:50% align:center
We need some sort of signal

00:12:49.728 --> 00:12:51.479 position:50% align:center
to let the other group
know we're ready.

00:12:51.563 --> 00:12:52.897 position:50% align:center
In that case, why don't we just

00:12:52.981 --> 00:12:54.607 position:50% align:center
call the other team
over the phone?

00:12:54.691 --> 00:12:56.067 position:50% align:center
[BLACK CAT]
You won't be able to use phones

00:12:56.151 --> 00:12:58.028 position:50% align:center
while inside Kansai Station.

00:12:58.111 --> 00:13:00.739 position:50% align:center
The place was constructed
to block all radio waves.

00:13:00.822 --> 00:13:03.867 position:50% align:center
Even so, I'm sure Hacker
can manage to bypass the--

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:05.869 position:50% align:center
Uh, hacking isn't
like magic, you know.

00:13:05.952 --> 00:13:08.788 position:50% align:center
There's no way signals
can penetrate the building.

00:13:08.872 --> 00:13:10.498 position:50% align:center
Were you even listening?

00:13:10.582 --> 00:13:12.125 position:50% align:center
Of course, my bad.

00:13:12.208 --> 00:13:14.502 position:50% align:center
[COURIER] Then we'll
decide on a time beforehand.

00:13:14.586 --> 00:13:16.087 position:50% align:center
[BLACK CAT]
It's imperative the buttons

00:13:16.171 --> 00:13:18.631 position:50% align:center
be pressed at the
exact same second.

00:13:18.715 --> 00:13:23.303 position:50% align:center
Teamwork is the name of the
game here. Are you up for it?

00:13:23.386 --> 00:13:27.015 position:50% align:center
Okay, remember what Mister Kitty
said? We have to use the power

00:13:27.098 --> 00:13:29.017 position:50% align:center
of teamwork to get
those buttons pressed!

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:31.728 position:50% align:center
Hacker? Lend me a flying drone?

00:13:31.811 --> 00:13:33.104 position:50% align:center
[HACKER]
Nope.

00:13:33.188 --> 00:13:35.732 position:50% align:center
[BRAWLER] Man. I hate it here!
We haven't run into

00:13:35.815 --> 00:13:38.276 position:50% align:center
a single guard or bot
since we got inside!

Whoa. Calm down, my man!

00:13:39.861 --> 00:13:42.530 position:50% align:center
I'm sure that demon guard
is right around the corner!

00:13:42.614 --> 00:13:44.032 position:50% align:center

It feels different from
the rest of the station.

00:14:00.548 --> 00:14:02.759 position:50% align:center
What's that red thing?

00:14:02.842 --> 00:14:05.470 position:50% align:center
[ORDINARY] The switch to the

Ooooh! It's red!

What's the matter,

00:14:55.562 --> 00:14:59.190 position:50% align:center

that they'll be successful?

00:14:59.274 --> 00:15:02.152 position:50% align:center

We've only got two minutes

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:12.954 position:50% align:center

00:17:13.158 --> 00:17:14.993 position:50% align:center
Two! One!

00:17:15.076 --> 00:17:16.327 position:50% align:center
[HOODLUM grunts]

00:17:19.205 --> 00:17:22.792 position:50% align:center
My face... Huh?

00:17:22.876 --> 00:17:24.544 position:50% align:center
[ORDINARY]
Done!

00:17:24.627 --> 00:17:26.838 position:50% align:center
Now, let's get up
to that platform!

00:17:26.921 --> 00:17:28.465 position:50% align:center
My poor, precious blade.

00:17:28.548 --> 00:17:30.133 position:50% align:center
My drone...

00:17:30.216 --> 00:17:31.468 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:17:31.551 --> 00:17:33.887 position:50% align:center
[beeping]

00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:36.765 position:50% align:center
Well, whattya know. Somehow
these guys pulled it off.

00:17:36.848 --> 00:17:38.558 position:50% align:center
Considering how
the elevator moved,

00:17:38.641 --> 00:17:40.685 position:50% align:center
we obviously didn't screw up.

00:17:40.769 --> 00:17:45.023 position:50% align:center
How dumb can you be?
What're you waiting for?

00:17:45.106 --> 00:17:46.900 position:50% align:center
We don't have all day, you know.

00:17:46.983 --> 00:17:48.985 position:50% align:center
Uh. Right!

00:18:01.873 --> 00:18:05.168 position:50% align:center
[ORDINARY]
Wow. The Shinkansen.

00:18:05.251 --> 00:18:07.087 position:50% align:center
Incredible,
this thing is massive!

00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:09.297 position:50% align:center
That's enough oohing
and awing, sweetie.

00:18:09.381 --> 00:18:11.966 position:50% align:center
Let's get back on track and
get inside the thing already.

00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:13.510 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you're right.

00:18:13.593 --> 00:18:15.220 position:50% align:center
You heard her, Mister Hoodlum!
You're up!

00:18:15.303 --> 00:18:18.098 position:50% align:center
Uh? Oh, yeah! That's right!

00:18:18.181 --> 00:18:19.808 position:50% align:center
What's this? What is this?

00:18:19.891 --> 00:18:21.434 position:50% align:center
[BLACK CAT] Just a little
something I brought

00:18:21.518 --> 00:18:22.936 position:50% align:center
from the Kyushu Plant.

00:18:23.019 --> 00:18:24.938 position:50% align:center
And it does what now?

00:18:25.021 --> 00:18:26.690 position:50% align:center
[BLACK CAT]
This will disable the platform's

00:18:26.773 --> 00:18:28.566 position:50% align:center
electromagnetic barrier.

00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:31.444 position:50% align:center
Allowing Courier to enter the
Shinkansen's hold safely,

00:18:31.528 --> 00:18:32.821 position:50% align:center
bike and all.

00:18:32.904 --> 00:18:35.699 position:50% align:center
As soon as the barrier's
down, I'll haul ass.

00:18:35.782 --> 00:18:37.117 position:50% align:center
[BLACK CAT]
Please do.

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.869 position:50% align:center
Hacker, you getting
inside the Shinkansen

00:18:39.953 --> 00:18:42.831 position:50% align:center
and disabling the plasma field
is of utmost importance.

00:18:42.914 --> 00:18:45.625 position:50% align:center
Otherwise, no one else is
getting aboard the thing.

00:18:45.709 --> 00:18:47.585 position:50% align:center
[BLACK CAT]
Right. And with that,

00:18:47.669 --> 00:18:49.963 position:50% align:center
our invasion will be complete.

00:18:50.046 --> 00:18:53.466 position:50% align:center
[HOODLUM laughs] The fate of
the plan rests with me.

00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:55.510 position:50% align:center
With this finger,
I control the destiny of--

00:18:55.593 --> 00:18:57.178 position:50% align:center
So I push this, right?

00:19:11.693 --> 00:19:13.528 position:50% align:center
Let's ride.

00:19:17.073 --> 00:19:18.241 position:50% align:center
Not good.

00:19:18.324 --> 00:19:19.993 position:50% align:center
Yeah, feelin' pretty bad.

00:19:20.076 --> 00:19:21.745 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER]
Due to an emergency,

00:19:21.828 --> 00:19:24.998 position:50% align:center
the Shinkansen will
depart in 60 seconds.

00:19:25.081 --> 00:19:28.626 position:50% align:center
Please finish loading cargo
immediately. I repeat...

00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:32.255 position:50% align:center
No way! Did you hear that?
We've gotta hurry up, Hacker!

00:19:32.339 --> 00:19:35.175 position:50% align:center
The surge also cut off
my power, in other words,

00:19:35.258 --> 00:19:37.510 position:50% align:center
I didn't get a chance
to modify all the data.

00:19:37.594 --> 00:19:39.679 position:50% align:center
Wait. So that means...?

00:19:39.763 --> 00:19:41.556 position:50% align:center
If I get in the box
and go through,

00:19:41.639 --> 00:19:44.059 position:50% align:center
the security system
will turn me into dust.

00:19:44.142 --> 00:19:47.645 position:50% align:center
Seriously?
But Courier's almost here!

00:19:51.608 --> 00:19:53.485 position:50% align:center
[HACKER]
There might still be a way.

00:19:53.568 --> 00:19:56.905 position:50% align:center
I modified all the values,
except for the weight.

00:19:56.988 --> 00:19:59.532 position:50% align:center
The original cargo has
a heavier mass than I do,

00:19:59.616 --> 00:20:01.409 position:50% align:center
so I won't clear the checkpoint.

00:20:01.493 --> 00:20:05.372 position:50% align:center
However, if we can find someone
who's lighter than me...

00:20:05.455 --> 00:20:09.250 position:50% align:center
I don't wanna pry, but who
exactly does that leave?

00:20:12.253 --> 00:20:15.757 position:50% align:center
Me! I volunteer!

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:18.134 position:50% align:center
And you're positive that
you weigh less than me?

00:20:18.218 --> 00:20:22.681 position:50% align:center
Only jerks ask girls their
weight! Learn some manners!

00:20:38.279 --> 00:20:39.781 position:50% align:center
[CUTTHROAT]
Oooh!

00:20:48.039 --> 00:20:51.584 position:50% align:center
[ORDINARY]
Where are you? Where are you?

00:20:53.545 --> 00:20:55.088 position:50% align:center
Found it!

00:21:02.137 --> 00:21:05.390 position:50% align:center
[ORDINARY grunting]

00:21:08.143 --> 00:21:12.147 position:50% align:center
Move, you shit!

00:21:17.318 --> 00:21:18.945 position:50% align:center
Right on time.

00:21:19.029 --> 00:21:20.947 position:50% align:center
[ORDINARY grunts]

00:21:21.031 --> 00:21:23.324 position:50% align:center
You have no idea.

00:21:31.583 --> 00:21:36.171 position:50% align:center
The train was hijacked?
But this is Kansai Station!

00:21:38.965 --> 00:21:41.343 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER]
Emergency start.

00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:48.099 position:50% align:center
[BLACK CAT] I didn't account
for the Shinkansen departing,

00:21:48.183 --> 00:21:51.436 position:50% align:center
but at least we've cleared
the first hurdles.

00:21:51.519 --> 00:21:55.523 position:50% align:center
And now... the real
challenge can begin.

00:23:44.632 --> 00:23:46.885 position:50% align:center
[ORDINARY]
Who in the world are you guys?
