[BUNNY]
Heyo! Bunny Here!

00:00:12.721 --> 00:00:15.807 position:50% align:center
[SHARK]
And Shark. Hiya!

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:17.267 position:50% align:center
[BUNNY]
So sorry, TV land!

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.853 position:50% align:center
You probably noticed
we didn't air last time!

00:00:19.936 --> 00:00:22.647 position:50% align:center
[SHARK]
Please forgive us!

00:00:22.731 --> 00:00:24.774 position:50% align:center
[BUNNY] Those Executioners
hijacked the airwaves

00:00:24.858 --> 00:00:26.818 position:50% align:center
and spoiled all our fun!

00:00:26.901 --> 00:00:28.653 position:50% align:center
[SHARK]
It's a real shame, cuz I had

00:00:28.737 --> 00:00:31.114 position:50% align:center
some great jokes
lined up for you all!

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:34.743 position:50% align:center
[BUNNY] But it's a small price
to pay for peace an--

00:00:34.826 --> 00:00:36.077 position:50% align:center
Man, Sharkie.

00:00:36.161 --> 00:00:38.288 position:50% align:center
It's too bad your new
material went to waste,

00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:40.999 position:50% align:center
but those Executioners
are real riled up,

00:00:41.082 --> 00:00:42.917 position:50% align:center
so we better be super careful!

00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:46.588 position:50% align:center
[SHARK]
Yeah, yeah. Copy that, Bunny!

00:00:46.671 --> 00:00:48.423 position:50% align:center
[BUNNY] Believe me,
when people with power

00:00:48.506 --> 00:00:51.343 position:50% align:center
get this worked up,
nothing good comes from it!

00:00:51.426 --> 00:00:53.845 position:50% align:center
So, all you folks out
there in front of the TV--

00:00:53.928 --> 00:00:55.597 position:50% align:center
don't trust every--

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:01.478 position:50% align:center
[MAN A] Are there really a bunch
of Super S-Rank Akudama

00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:02.729 position:50% align:center
on the loose?

00:01:02.812 --> 00:01:04.064 position:50% align:center
[MAN B] I heard Swindler
was seen in Dotonbori!

00:01:04.147 --> 00:01:05.231 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN B]
Apparently some people

00:01:05.315 --> 00:01:06.691 position:50% align:center
in the north say they've
seen Cutthroat...

00:01:06.775 --> 00:01:07.817 position:50% align:center
[MAN C] The neighborhood's
forming a vigilante group...

00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:09.194 position:50% align:center
[PROTESTER]
We must purge the Akudama!

00:01:09.277 --> 00:01:12.405 position:50% align:center
They threaten our safety
and the future of Kansai!

00:01:12.489 --> 00:01:14.908 position:50% align:center
The police need all
the help we can give.

00:01:14.991 --> 00:01:16.993 position:50% align:center
Let's flush out every last--

00:01:17.077 --> 00:01:23.708 position:50% align:center
[BROTHER] How long do you plan
on keeping me here? Ridiculous.

00:01:23.792 --> 00:01:25.794 position:50% align:center
Considering I'm
completely harmless,

00:01:25.877 --> 00:01:27.212 position:50% align:center
it's clear you're
just guarding me

00:01:27.295 --> 00:01:28.421 position:50% align:center
because you've got
nothing better to do.

00:01:28.505 --> 00:01:30.298 position:50% align:center
Hey. Know your place!

00:01:30.382 --> 00:01:32.342 position:50% align:center
Actually, I do have
more pressing matters

00:01:32.425 --> 00:01:34.010 position:50% align:center
than babysitting some brat.

00:01:34.094 --> 00:01:36.179 position:50% align:center
Luckily you'll be
sent off to Kanto soon.

00:01:36.262 --> 00:01:39.683 position:50% align:center
It's not like I would run,
even if I got the chance.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.315 position:50% align:center
Because there's nowhere
left to run to anymore.

00:03:25.663 --> 00:03:27.165 position:50% align:center
[ORDINARY] Who knew dried
and canned foods

00:03:27.248 --> 00:03:30.085 position:50% align:center
could be whipped into
a gourmet banquet?

00:03:30.168 --> 00:03:32.671 position:50% align:center
You could've been a chef
in another life, Courier!

00:03:32.754 --> 00:03:34.005 position:50% align:center
It tastes like shit.

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:35.423 position:50% align:center
Seriously, we're eating dude.

00:03:35.507 --> 00:03:39.052 position:50% align:center
Big Sis! This red
thing's tasty! Here!

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.182 position:50% align:center
Whoa, don't tell me
that was a tomato?

00:03:44.265 --> 00:03:46.559 position:50% align:center
A real one? They're ultra-rare!

00:03:46.643 --> 00:03:48.812 position:50% align:center
Tomato! Real! Rare!

00:03:48.895 --> 00:03:52.399 position:50% align:center
[COURIER] You guys obliterated
my pantry. That'll cost ya.

00:03:52.482 --> 00:03:55.777 position:50% align:center
[ORDINARY] You can't fight
on an empty stomach!

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.322 position:50% align:center
This really is a no-frills
kinda place you got here.

00:03:59.406 --> 00:04:03.660 position:50% align:center
Nothing but the essentials.
I mean, not like I'm surprised.

00:04:03.743 --> 00:04:07.122 position:50% align:center
It's just a safe house,
all right? Moving on.

00:04:07.205 --> 00:04:10.250 position:50% align:center
Let's hear your plan.
What do we do first, huh?

00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:11.126 position:50% align:center
Well, I...

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:14.504 position:50% align:center
I know! We gotta find Brother!

00:04:14.587 --> 00:04:17.090 position:50% align:center
I've been thinking
about the Seal Center.

00:04:17.173 --> 00:04:20.051 position:50% align:center
All of Kansai's information
is transferred through there.

00:04:20.135 --> 00:04:22.512 position:50% align:center
So if we could
sneak in somehow...

00:04:22.595 --> 00:04:25.056 position:50% align:center
Believe it or not,
I even used to work there!

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.141 position:50% align:center
If we use my seal, then we--

00:04:26.224 --> 00:04:28.518 position:50% align:center
[COURIER]
Your seal is useless now.

00:04:28.601 --> 00:04:33.106 position:50% align:center
Don't you remember?
You're a Super S-Rank Akudama.

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:36.359 position:50% align:center
Yeah. You're right.

00:04:36.443 --> 00:04:38.987 position:50% align:center
Don't be sad.

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.197 position:50% align:center
Either way, if it's
the only shot we've got

00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:43.450 position:50% align:center
at finding Brother,
then I say we take it!

00:04:43.533 --> 00:04:45.660 position:50% align:center
We don't really have
much of a choice anyway.

00:04:45.744 --> 00:04:47.454 position:50% align:center
And if my seal doesn't work,
there's a back do--

00:04:47.537 --> 00:04:49.080 position:50% align:center
You must have shit for brains.

00:04:49.164 --> 00:04:52.375 position:50% align:center
Hey! Big sis isn't shit!

00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:54.586 position:50% align:center
You worked there, you should
know better than anyone

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:56.171 position:50% align:center
how bad a plan that is.

00:04:56.254 --> 00:04:59.382 position:50% align:center
Dang, you've got a real
gift for crushing hopes.

00:04:59.466 --> 00:05:02.218 position:50% align:center
It sure would be nice to have
Hacker right about now.

00:05:02.302 --> 00:05:03.720 position:50% align:center
He could probably
get us in there.

00:05:03.803 --> 00:05:07.766 position:50% align:center
[COURIER] Well, he's not here,
is he? Use your head.

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:09.351 position:50% align:center
There're better ways
of figuring out

00:05:09.434 --> 00:05:11.728 position:50% align:center
where Brother's being held.

00:05:15.732 --> 00:05:19.778 position:50% align:center
[COURIER] You wanna find him?
Well, who took him away?

00:05:19.861 --> 00:05:21.112 position:50% align:center
Good point!

00:05:21.196 --> 00:05:23.823 position:50% align:center
The Executioners had him last,
so we go to them.

00:05:23.907 --> 00:05:25.325 position:50% align:center
Wait a sec.

00:05:25.408 --> 00:05:28.286 position:50% align:center
Are you suggesting we march
down to their headquarters?

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.206 position:50% align:center
That place is a death
trap for people like us.

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:32.582 position:50% align:center
There's no way.

00:05:32.665 --> 00:05:36.378 position:50% align:center
[COURIER] Doesn't matter.
We're Akudama, remember?

00:05:39.673 --> 00:05:46.096 position:50% align:center
[CUTTHROAT]
Red. Red. Red. Red.

00:05:46.179 --> 00:05:53.978 position:50% align:center
Red. Red. Red. Red!

00:06:05.448 --> 00:06:09.035 position:50% align:center
[HOODLUM]
So why, uh, with me?

00:06:09.119 --> 00:06:11.246 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR] Don't tell me you
thought it meant something.

00:06:11.329 --> 00:06:12.122 position:50% align:center
Please.

00:06:12.205 --> 00:06:14.207 position:50% align:center
[HOODLUM]
Uh, n-no.

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:16.376 position:50% align:center
There was no reason behind it.

00:06:16.459 --> 00:06:18.795 position:50% align:center
I'm just being true
to myself, that's all.

00:06:18.878 --> 00:06:20.380 position:50% align:center
Nothing more.

00:06:20.463 --> 00:06:22.841 position:50% align:center
I take it getting ahold
of those two brats

00:06:22.924 --> 00:06:26.094 position:50% align:center
is being true to yourself, too?
What, d'you wanna study 'em,

00:06:26.177 --> 00:06:28.972 position:50% align:center
try to become immortal
or some shit?

00:06:29.055 --> 00:06:30.515 position:50% align:center
I don't know why.

00:06:30.598 --> 00:06:33.184 position:50% align:center
The way I see it, you're
plenty immortal already.

00:06:33.268 --> 00:06:35.562 position:50% align:center
Such mind-boggling ignorance.

00:06:35.645 --> 00:06:37.856 position:50% align:center
Do you have any thoughts
in that head of yours?

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:39.024 position:50% align:center
Huh...?

00:06:39.107 --> 00:06:41.609 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR]
I have no interest in that.

00:06:41.693 --> 00:06:46.906 position:50% align:center
Life's supposed to end. And if
it doesn't, it's defective.

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:49.576 position:50% align:center
Only one thing really
matters in this world,

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:51.411 position:50% align:center
and that's having freedom.

00:06:51.494 --> 00:06:54.372 position:50% align:center
And controlling said
freedom is my goal.

00:06:54.456 --> 00:06:57.709 position:50% align:center
But for all living beings,
there's one fundamental thing

00:06:57.792 --> 00:07:00.754 position:50% align:center
we can't control,
and that is death.

00:07:00.837 --> 00:07:02.088 position:50% align:center
[HOODLUM]
Death?

00:07:02.172 --> 00:07:04.549 position:50% align:center
I want to control the death
of all those living,

00:07:04.632 --> 00:07:09.262 position:50% align:center
and when I say all, I mean it.
My own death included.

00:07:09.346 --> 00:07:11.264 position:50% align:center
Up until this moment,

00:07:11.348 --> 00:07:14.267 position:50% align:center
I've tried nearly everything
to manipulate death.

00:07:14.351 --> 00:07:16.394 position:50% align:center
Medicines from around the world.

00:07:16.478 --> 00:07:19.189 position:50% align:center
Advanced surgeries of
every kind imaginable.

00:07:19.272 --> 00:07:20.774 position:50% align:center
You name it.

00:07:20.857 --> 00:07:24.569 position:50% align:center
And yet, death remains
outside my control.

00:07:24.652 --> 00:07:26.363 position:50% align:center
After all my efforts,

00:07:26.446 --> 00:07:28.740 position:50% align:center
do you know how long
I've spent trying?

00:07:28.823 --> 00:07:29.949 position:50% align:center
Those man-hours?

00:07:30.033 --> 00:07:31.368 position:50% align:center
But no luck.

00:07:31.451 --> 00:07:34.579 position:50% align:center
Death continues to stubbornly
refuse my advances.

00:07:34.662 --> 00:07:36.998 position:50% align:center
And do I look like someone
who'd allow themselves

00:07:37.082 --> 00:07:38.875 position:50% align:center
to be defied to you?

00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:43.046 position:50% align:center
Then out of the blue,
those kids appeared.

00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:44.756 position:50% align:center
They're fascinating.

00:07:44.839 --> 00:07:47.717 position:50% align:center
Children with infinitely
dividing cells.

00:07:47.801 --> 00:07:49.678 position:50% align:center
If given the chance
to study them,

00:07:49.761 --> 00:07:52.180 position:50% align:center
perhaps I could finally
control freedom.

00:07:52.263 --> 00:07:54.599 position:50% align:center
When I say to "live,"
things will live.

00:07:54.683 --> 00:07:57.769 position:50% align:center
When I say to "die,"
they will die that instant.

00:07:57.852 --> 00:08:03.274 position:50% align:center
All life with no choice
but to obey my will.

00:08:03.358 --> 00:08:05.485 position:50% align:center

00:08:08.738 --> 00:08:13.368 position:50% align:center
I dare you to name me a desire
sweeter than that one.

00:08:13.451 --> 00:08:16.204 position:50% align:center
There you go again,
blowing my mind.

00:08:16.287 --> 00:08:18.498 position:50% align:center
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

00:08:18.581 --> 00:08:21.543 position:50% align:center
Out of curiosity, how old
do you think I am?

00:08:21.626 --> 00:08:22.544 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:22.627 --> 00:08:24.921 position:50% align:center

What's wrong now?

00:08:59.956 --> 00:09:02.292 position:50% align:center
[EXECUTIONER A] As you can see,
there's an uprising.

00:09:02.375 --> 00:09:04.252 position:50% align:center
[EXECUTIONER C] People across
the city are calling themselves

00:09:04.336 --> 00:09:06.463 position:50% align:center
vigilantes and killing Akudama.

Whenever the mob finds one,

00:09:07.922 --> 00:09:10.342 position:50% align:center
they're dragged into the street
and beaten to death.

Do we know what
started all this?

00:09:12.218 --> 00:09:14.262 position:50% align:center

someone claiming to be

that the Akudama

[EXECUTIONER B]
Following that,

00:09:18.516 --> 00:09:20.477 position:50% align:center
there were reported
sightings of Swindler,

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.687 position:50% align:center
as well a series of
Cutthroat related killings,

00:09:22.771 --> 00:09:24.689 position:50% align:center
which created a frenzy.

00:09:24.773 --> 00:09:26.733 position:50% align:center
[EXECUTIONER C] These events
fanned the flames of hatred

00:09:26.816 --> 00:09:30.111 position:50% align:center
for the Akudama,
it's practically an inferno.

00:09:30.195 --> 00:09:32.572 position:50% align:center
The timing couldn't
be any worse.

00:09:32.655 --> 00:09:35.325 position:50% align:center
Go handle the situation
as best as you can.

00:09:35.408 --> 00:09:37.410 position:50% align:center
I'm heading down to the station.

00:09:37.494 --> 00:09:40.747 position:50% align:center
That useless police chief is
begging for our assistance.

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:43.500 position:50% align:center
[EXECUTIONER A] Try not
to let him drive you crazy.

[BOSS sighs]

00:09:50.423 --> 00:09:52.258 position:50% align:center
[ORDINARY]
Wow. Well, this turned out

00:09:52.342 --> 00:09:53.635 position:50% align:center
bigger than I expected.

00:09:53.718 --> 00:09:55.470 position:50% align:center
I didn't know you could
manipulate people.

00:09:55.553 --> 00:09:57.764 position:50% align:center
I can't! A bunch of them

00:09:57.847 --> 00:10:00.684 position:50% align:center
just saw me around town,
so I figured they'd notice

00:10:00.767 --> 00:10:03.103 position:50% align:center
if I made some
insane post online.

00:10:03.186 --> 00:10:04.604 position:50% align:center
Never in a million years

00:10:04.688 --> 00:10:07.440 position:50% align:center
did I expect the response
would be this crazy!

00:10:07.524 --> 00:10:08.817 position:50% align:center
I guess everyone's made me into

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:11.486 position:50% align:center
a pretty big deal,
huh? Who knows?

00:10:11.569 --> 00:10:13.738 position:50% align:center
Maybe I could get used
to this kind of attention.

00:10:13.822 --> 00:10:15.365 position:50% align:center
[COURIER]
It just goes to show you

00:10:15.448 --> 00:10:18.743 position:50% align:center
the people of Kansai
absolutely loathe Akudama.

00:10:18.827 --> 00:10:22.789 position:50% align:center
But on the bright side,
security's thinned out.

00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:26.501 position:50% align:center
[OFFICER A]
Is Swindler really giving orders

00:10:26.584 --> 00:10:28.420 position:50% align:center
to the other Akudama? Damn.

00:10:28.503 --> 00:10:30.130 position:50% align:center
[OFFICER B] Not sure,
but I heard a group of 'em

00:10:30.213 --> 00:10:31.339 position:50% align:center
is heading to the station!

00:10:31.423 --> 00:10:33.133 position:50% align:center
Guys! I just saw that Cutthroat

00:10:33.216 --> 00:10:35.010 position:50% align:center
murdered a bunch people
south of here!

00:10:35.093 --> 00:10:38.304 position:50% align:center
Man! What the hell is going
on with Kansai these days?

00:10:38.388 --> 00:10:43.601 position:50% align:center
[CUTTHROAT] Pretty!
So pretty! Look at it sparkle!

00:10:43.685 --> 00:10:45.562 position:50% align:center
Hey, get lost!
You're trespassing!

00:10:45.645 --> 00:10:49.983 position:50% align:center
[gasps] It's... It's him!
That's Cutthroat!

00:10:55.155 --> 00:10:59.909 position:50% align:center
Incredible!
I can't wait much longer.

00:11:04.289 --> 00:11:07.542 position:50% align:center
[BOSS] Shouldn't you be using
every weapon at your disposal?

00:11:07.625 --> 00:11:10.462 position:50% align:center
It's not as though this problem
is going away on its own.

00:11:10.545 --> 00:11:12.297 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I get that,

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:14.966 position:50% align:center
but we don't even know how
things got this bad yet!

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:17.594 position:50% align:center
Let's not act rashly.
First things first,

00:11:17.677 --> 00:11:19.220 position:50% align:center
we should launch
an investigation

00:11:19.304 --> 00:11:20.597 position:50% align:center
to find out what
started this revolt!

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:22.724 position:50% align:center
Have you bothered
looking outside?

00:11:22.807 --> 00:11:25.185 position:50% align:center
There is an army of civilians
trying to barge into

00:11:25.268 --> 00:11:27.979 position:50% align:center
the station. If they're not
demanding you kill the prisoners

00:11:28.063 --> 00:11:29.856 position:50% align:center
you've got locked up,
they're hunting down

00:11:29.939 --> 00:11:32.567 position:50% align:center
minor offenders and slaughtering
them in the streets.

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:35.362 position:50% align:center
All in hopes of getting
some kind of reward.

00:11:35.445 --> 00:11:37.072 position:50% align:center
I know, I know!

00:11:37.155 --> 00:11:39.115 position:50% align:center
But the Kansai Police
can't turn their backs

00:11:39.199 --> 00:11:41.534 position:50% align:center
on the civilians they're
supposed to protect!

00:11:41.618 --> 00:11:42.452 position:50% align:center
The Akudama aren't our--

00:11:42.535 --> 00:11:44.496 position:50% align:center
I swear, men are useless.

00:11:44.579 --> 00:11:46.581 position:50% align:center
Suddenly cowards
when things get tough.

00:11:46.664 --> 00:11:47.916 position:50% align:center
We're just trying to--

00:11:47.999 --> 00:11:49.626 position:50% align:center
[BOSS] The citizens you're
so desperate to protect

00:11:49.709 --> 00:11:51.419 position:50% align:center
are rioting as we speak!

00:11:51.503 --> 00:11:56.091 position:50% align:center
I did everything I could
to avoid this, but...

00:11:56.174 --> 00:11:59.135 position:50% align:center
After that failed attempt
at executing Cutthroat,

00:11:59.219 --> 00:12:01.388 position:50% align:center
seven Akudama proceeded
to sneak aboard

00:12:01.471 --> 00:12:03.264 position:50% align:center
and attack the Shinkansen.

00:12:03.348 --> 00:12:05.642 position:50% align:center
Such a brazen attack
on a revered symbol

00:12:05.725 --> 00:12:09.312 position:50% align:center
made the public detest
the Akudama even more.

00:12:09.396 --> 00:12:12.399 position:50% align:center
When we responded by issuing
a large-scale search,

00:12:12.482 --> 00:12:14.609 position:50% align:center
our intention was to
force them out of hiding,

00:12:14.693 --> 00:12:16.152 position:50% align:center
and bring them to justice.

00:12:16.236 --> 00:12:19.322 position:50% align:center
Instead, it only intensified
the people's fear.

00:12:19.406 --> 00:12:21.783 position:50% align:center
And then, there's Swindler.

00:12:21.866 --> 00:12:24.536 position:50% align:center
She made an absurd statement--
how she's "leading"

00:12:24.619 --> 00:12:26.996 position:50% align:center
the Akudama in a war
against Kansai,

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:30.083 position:50% align:center
while Cutthroat's going
on a killing spree.

00:12:30.166 --> 00:12:35.130 position:50% align:center
Civil unrest was a bomb
waiting to be set off.

00:12:35.213 --> 00:12:36.381 position:50% align:center
Why couldn't this have happened

00:12:36.464 --> 00:12:38.008 position:50% align:center
when someone else
was police chief?

00:12:38.091 --> 00:12:39.175 position:50% align:center
It's not fair!

00:12:39.259 --> 00:12:41.720 position:50% align:center
Surely you can do more
than cry! Listen.

00:12:41.803 --> 00:12:45.306 position:50% align:center
The Kansai Police need to shut
this down before it gets worse.

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:48.018 position:50% align:center
As long as I'm the
Execution Department boss,

00:12:48.101 --> 00:12:50.603 position:50% align:center
the Akudama will
not get their way!

No matter where you run to...

00:17:44.356 --> 00:17:49.736 position:50% align:center
[CUTTHROAT] Wherever you hide,
I'll know immediately!

00:17:49.819 --> 00:17:51.112 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:17:51.196 --> 00:17:55.116 position:50% align:center
Come my angel! You're mine!

[CUTTHROAT] Lemme kill you
already. I wanna kill you now!

00:18:13.802 --> 00:18:16.262 position:50% align:center
Hey, shit guy! Where's Big Sis?

00:18:16.346 --> 00:18:19.724 position:50% align:center
--[COURIER] Sit.
--I'm not leaving without her!

00:18:19.808 --> 00:18:22.394 position:50% align:center
I've still got a job to do.

00:18:25.563 --> 00:18:29.859 position:50% align:center
[ORDINARY] I wonder why
this door was open.

00:18:29.943 --> 00:18:31.403 position:50% align:center
Ten minutes to go.

00:18:31.486 --> 00:18:34.823 position:50% align:center
[CUTTHROAT] I told you didn't I?
It's useless to run from me!

00:18:34.906 --> 00:18:37.867 position:50% align:center
At this rate,
he'll really kill me.

00:18:41.371 --> 00:18:44.541 position:50% align:center
[CUTTHROAT]
Red. Red. Red. Red.

00:18:44.624 --> 00:18:48.044 position:50% align:center

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:14.904 position:50% align:center
[CUTTHROAT] I'm sorry, Swindler.
I'm being selfish.

00:19:14.988 --> 00:19:19.117 position:50% align:center
No one in the whole world
wants to be killed.

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:21.745 position:50% align:center
I realize now what
I did was wrong,

00:19:21.828 --> 00:19:25.832 position:50% align:center
and I'm sorry for everything.
I wanna kil--

00:19:25.915 --> 00:19:29.502 position:50% align:center
I wanna be friends.
I won't hurt you.

00:19:29.586 --> 00:19:32.380 position:50% align:center
Let me in, pretty please?

00:19:34.174 --> 00:19:35.717 position:50% align:center
[ORDINARY]
Are you telling the truth?

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:37.510 position:50% align:center
Yeah! Absolutely!

00:19:37.594 --> 00:19:40.638 position:50% align:center
[ORDINARY] And you promise you
won't try to kill me anymore?

00:19:40.722 --> 00:19:43.767 position:50% align:center
Yes, of course!
Of course I do!

00:19:44.768 --> 00:19:49.397 position:50% align:center
[ORDINARY] All right. Step back
and I'll open the door.

00:19:54.611 --> 00:19:57.364 position:50% align:center
[CUTTHROAT] Thanks for
letting me in, Swindler.

00:19:57.447 --> 00:19:59.574 position:50% align:center
I'm really sorry...

00:20:01.159 --> 00:20:02.410 position:50% align:center
I was lying.

00:20:02.494 --> 00:20:03.745 position:50% align:center
[ORDINARY]
Go figure.

00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:08.833 position:50% align:center
[ORDINARY yells]

00:20:09.709 --> 00:20:11.711 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:20:13.672 --> 00:20:17.258 position:50% align:center
[CUTTHROAT]
Why are you so mean?

00:20:17.342 --> 00:20:19.094 position:50% align:center
[ORDINARY groans]

00:20:19.177 --> 00:20:20.804 position:50% align:center
[CUTTHROAT]
Bad move, Swindler.

00:20:20.887 --> 00:20:23.598 position:50% align:center
You gotta chop off all my limbs.

00:20:23.682 --> 00:20:26.393 position:50% align:center
Did you think you could win
if I was injured?

00:20:26.476 --> 00:20:28.812 position:50% align:center
Too bad! But I want to thank you

00:20:28.895 --> 00:20:32.148 position:50% align:center

so much fun for me!

00:20:32.232 --> 00:20:36.528 position:50% align:center

00:20:46.579 --> 00:20:48.123 position:50% align:center
[CUTTHROAT]
Huh?

00:20:57.298 --> 00:21:00.385 position:50% align:center
[coughing]

00:21:00.468 --> 00:21:04.597 position:50% align:center
What happened?
It's so black.

00:21:04.681 --> 00:21:12.105 position:50% align:center
It's all black. But the red.
Where'd all the red... go?

00:21:23.742 --> 00:21:25.785 position:50% align:center
Come on. Make it...

00:21:25.869 --> 00:21:27.537 position:50% align:center
[SISTER]
Big Sis!

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:29.789 position:50% align:center
Wait, Courier? Why are--?

00:21:29.873 --> 00:21:31.207 position:50% align:center

I've gotta deliver you
both to Brother, don't I?

00:21:34.669 --> 00:21:35.837 position:50% align:center
Let's go. Now.

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:37.047 position:50% align:center
[SISTER]
Hop on!

00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:38.465 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:21:48.808 --> 00:21:49.976 position:50% align:center
[SISTER, ORDINARY gasp]

[BROTHER gasping]

00:21:54.189 --> 00:21:55.982 position:50% align:center

00:23:42.922 --> 00:23:46.843 position:50% align:center
[HOODLUM] You were the best
