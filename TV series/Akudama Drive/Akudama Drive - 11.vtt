Whoa. A takoyaki stand?

Wow, I can't remember
the last time I had some.

00:01:02.145 --> 00:01:04.439 position:50% align:center
Maybe we should change that!

00:01:04.522 --> 00:01:05.857 position:50% align:center
One, two...

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.193 position:50% align:center
[ORDINARY] Hi, there!
One order of takoyaki, please!

00:01:08.276 --> 00:01:12.405 position:50% align:center
Sure thing. It's 500 yen.
Here you go.

And yours, dear!

00:01:16.242 --> 00:01:17.202 position:50% align:center
Thanks! Yum!

[OLD LADY A]
Come again!

00:03:00.055 --> 00:03:01.514 position:50% align:center
So, um...

00:03:01.598 --> 00:03:05.935 position:50% align:center
What happened to the people
and Akudama on the Shinkansen?

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.230 position:50% align:center
[PUPIL] They left for Kanto.
That's all I know.

00:03:09.314 --> 00:03:13.360 position:50% align:center
Oh, I see. What about
the uprising?

00:03:13.443 --> 00:03:15.862 position:50% align:center
[PUPIL]
Check the Akudama list.

00:03:20.075 --> 00:03:22.077 position:50% align:center
[JUNIOR]
There's so many.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.162 position:50% align:center
[PUPIL]
Yep, and all killed yesterday.

00:03:24.245 --> 00:03:25.580 position:50% align:center
[JUNIOR gasps]

00:03:25.663 --> 00:03:29.167 position:50% align:center
[PUPIL] The rioters were
declared criminals and executed.

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.460 position:50% align:center
They what?

00:03:30.543 --> 00:03:32.671 position:50% align:center
You're kidding, they were
just regular people!

00:03:32.754 --> 00:03:35.548 position:50% align:center
People we're supposed to have
a sworn duty to protect!

00:03:35.632 --> 00:03:39.052 position:50% align:center
[PUPIL] Those "regular people"
started an uprising.

00:03:39.135 --> 00:03:43.682 position:50% align:center
The fact is, their actions
caused the city damage.

00:03:43.765 --> 00:03:46.559 position:50% align:center
As a result, they were
declared Akudama.

00:03:46.643 --> 00:03:47.560 position:50% align:center
[JUNIOR]
But--

00:03:47.644 --> 00:03:48.937 position:50% align:center
[PUPIL]
Peace returned to the city

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.398 position:50% align:center
because the rioters
were executed.

00:03:51.481 --> 00:03:55.360 position:50% align:center
If nothing had been done,
Kansai would have collapsed.

00:03:55.443 --> 00:03:57.779 position:50% align:center
Boss took action.

00:03:57.862 --> 00:03:59.989 position:50% align:center
But to kill them?

00:04:01.491 --> 00:04:03.993 position:50% align:center
[JUNIOR]
Ma'am.

00:04:04.077 --> 00:04:08.289 position:50% align:center
What makes one an Akudama?

00:04:08.373 --> 00:04:11.292 position:50% align:center
[POLITICIAN A] Good job
suppressing the uprising.

00:04:11.376 --> 00:04:13.128 position:50% align:center
The praise is appreciated.

00:04:13.211 --> 00:04:15.964 position:50% align:center
[POLITICIAN A] You can expect
this to be reported to Kanto,

00:04:16.047 --> 00:04:18.925 position:50% align:center
along with how well
you handled it.

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:20.635 position:50% align:center
I'm honored.

I got to lay in bed!

Uh? Dude. Could you
leave me alone?

00:04:36.484 --> 00:04:40.196 position:50% align:center
Go and spend some time
with your wife and kids!

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.408 position:50% align:center
[yawns] From now on,
I'm coming home on time

00:04:43.491 --> 00:04:46.119 position:50% align:center

the second that I clock out!

My life should be like
this all of the time!

00:04:48.788 --> 00:04:50.623 position:50% align:center
Now then! I should probably

00:04:50.707 --> 00:04:54.085 position:50% align:center
start putting together
some din-- [groaning]

Ow, that hurt!

00:04:59.883 --> 00:05:02.719 position:50% align:center
What is this thing?

00:05:03.887 --> 00:05:07.390 position:50% align:center
Someone must've mistaken
my bag for theirs.

00:05:10.101 --> 00:05:13.772 position:50% align:center
Whoa! What the heck? Come back!

00:05:15.315 --> 00:05:19.861 position:50% align:center
Huh? Um. How'd I get here?

00:05:19.944 --> 00:05:23.823 position:50% align:center
Uh? Five-hundred yen?

[HACKER] I finally managed
to link up to your channel.

It's a good thing you guys
had that coin in common,

taken much longer.

00:09:36.993 --> 00:09:38.703 position:50% align:center
You gotta be around

[HACKER] You're half right

00:09:41.706 --> 00:09:44.584 position:50% align:center
I have been watching you,
that much is true,

00:09:44.668 --> 00:09:47.837 position:50% align:center

because I'm nowhere.

[COURIER]
What's that even mean?

00:09:49.297 --> 00:09:50.465 position:50% align:center
[HACKER]
How it sounds.

00:09:50.548 --> 00:09:53.051 position:50% align:center
Okay, whatever, can you
explain what's going on?

00:09:53.134 --> 00:09:55.845 position:50% align:center
Wasn't I just at home in Kansai?
I swear I was,

00:09:55.929 --> 00:09:57.555 position:50% align:center
but then Bunny and
Shark showed up?

00:09:57.639 --> 00:10:00.725 position:50% align:center
Y'know, the two characters
from that educational program?

00:10:00.809 --> 00:10:02.477 position:50% align:center
Also, where is everyone?

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:03.978 position:50% align:center
[HACKER]
That program was designed

00:10:04.062 --> 00:10:07.190 position:50% align:center
specifically for brainwashing.
It's a way of separating

00:10:07.273 --> 00:10:10.527 position:50% align:center
the body and mind of
everyone arriving in Kanto.

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:13.238 position:50% align:center
That's the real truth behind
the Decontamination Zone.

00:10:13.321 --> 00:10:18.451 position:50% align:center
Wait. So the program's the zone?
And what do you mean by "truth."

00:10:18.535 --> 00:10:21.162 position:50% align:center
[HACKER] You were both
inside of it just now.

If I hadn't stepped in,
you would've been

trapped in Kanto
along with the others.

00:10:26.376 --> 00:10:30.880 position:50% align:center
What? Did you just say
trapped in Kanto?

00:10:30.964 --> 00:10:35.635 position:50% align:center

she go? And Brother!

Those kids are what
Kanto wanted all along.

00:21:44.846 --> 00:21:47.640 position:50% align:center
But thank you.

00:21:55.357 --> 00:21:57.233 position:50% align:center
What's the hold up? Let's go.

00:21:57.317 --> 00:21:58.860 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:22:02.238 --> 00:22:03.698 position:50% align:center
[COURIER]
Damn shame.

00:22:03.782 --> 00:22:06.451 position:50% align:center
Without solid ground,
a bike's just a pretty toy.

00:22:06.534 --> 00:22:08.411 position:50% align:center
[ORDINARY] Would you like us
to leave you two alone?

00:22:08.495 --> 00:22:09.913 position:50% align:center
[SISTER]
Brother.

00:22:13.917 --> 00:22:17.504 position:50% align:center
Oh! Looks like another
successfully completed job.

00:22:17.587 --> 00:22:18.838 position:50% align:center
[COURIER]
Seems that way.

00:22:18.922 --> 00:22:20.674 position:50% align:center
[ORDINARY] Thanks again
for delivering us safely!

00:22:20.757 --> 00:22:23.259 position:50% align:center
Definitely worth every
last penny I owned.

00:22:23.343 --> 00:22:24.844 position:50% align:center
It's chump change,
nothing more.

00:22:24.928 --> 00:22:28.223 position:50% align:center
Not even the richest person ever
would have the gall to say that!

00:22:28.306 --> 00:22:30.350 position:50% align:center
So, what's your plan now?

00:22:30.433 --> 00:22:33.269 position:50% align:center
[SISTER] This time,
I'm gonna protect you!

00:22:33.353 --> 00:22:36.356 position:50% align:center
[ORDINARY] Imma take a gamble
and head to this Shikoku place.

00:22:36.439 --> 00:22:38.733 position:50% align:center
Kinda all or nothing, though.

00:22:38.817 --> 00:22:40.318 position:50% align:center
[SISTER] If we run into any
Executioners, I'm gonna...

00:22:40.402 --> 00:22:42.112 position:50% align:center
[ORDINARY] I want to make
sure these kids escape.

00:22:42.195 --> 00:22:43.947 position:50% align:center
[BROTHER]
Since when are you so vulgar?

00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:45.782 position:50% align:center
Better yet, when did
you get this talkative?

00:22:45.865 --> 00:22:48.118 position:50% align:center
[SISTER] Girls mature while boys
are busy playing in the dirt!

00:22:48.201 --> 00:22:49.327 position:50% align:center
[ORDINARY]
That's weird.

00:22:49.411 --> 00:22:50.537 position:50% align:center
[BROTHER] Who's been
teaching you this junk?

00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:51.913 position:50% align:center
I almost forgot!

00:22:51.996 --> 00:22:54.457 position:50% align:center
Big Sis and I went on
our very own adventure!

00:22:54.541 --> 00:22:57.085 position:50% align:center
You what? Hey, Swindler,
what did you do with my--

00:22:57.168 --> 00:23:01.047 position:50% align:center
What? Nothing wrong with a
little journey into adulthood...

00:23:01.131 --> 00:23:02.465 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Right?

00:23:02.549 --> 00:23:04.676 position:50% align:center
[SISTER] You can stay immature
however long you want,

00:23:04.759 --> 00:23:06.928 position:50% align:center
but I'm ready to grow up!

00:23:11.516 --> 00:23:15.061 position:50% align:center
[PILOT A] Shields down.
Locked on. Preparing to attack.

00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:23.069 position:50% align:center
[SQUAD MEMBER A]
Particle cannon, direct hit!

00:23:23.153 --> 00:23:25.989 position:50% align:center
The Shinkansen was
blown off the rails.

00:23:26.072 --> 00:23:28.783 position:50% align:center
No response from
the target as of yet.

00:23:45.592 --> 00:23:47.010 position:50% align:center
[ORDINARY]
Serves you right.
