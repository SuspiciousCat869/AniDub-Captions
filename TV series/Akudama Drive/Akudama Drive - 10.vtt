[PILOT A] Thirty-two hours
ago, Swindler's appearance

00:03:08.605 --> 00:03:10.982 position:50% align:center

Afterwards, she posted
on a message board,

00:03:13.485 --> 00:03:15.445 position:50% align:center
declaring war on Kansai.

00:03:15.528 --> 00:03:16.988 position:50% align:center
And she wasn't alone.

We believe Cutthroat went on
a killing spree to show support.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.744 position:50% align:center
Because of this,
citizens took their safety

00:03:22.827 --> 00:03:25.080 position:50% align:center
into their own hands

00:03:25.163 --> 00:03:26.498 position:50% align:center
No way.

We're at fault just

We hijacked the
airwaves intending

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.760 position:50% align:center
to smoke out the Akudama,
and it backfired.

00:03:38.843 --> 00:03:41.471 position:50% align:center
Swindler must've planned
on that all along.

00:03:41.554 --> 00:03:44.474 position:50% align:center
[PILOT A] Attacking HQ was
probably just for show.

You're wrong.

What's that mean?

00:03:54.818 --> 00:03:57.862 position:50% align:center
Swindler wouldn't make her
point by massacring people.

00:03:57.946 --> 00:04:01.282 position:50% align:center
You don't know that! Akudama
obviously don't have hearts!

00:04:01.366 --> 00:04:03.702 position:50% align:center
Which is why it's better
to just kill them!

You agree with me, right, Ma'am?

00:18:27.399 --> 00:18:31.111 position:50% align:center
Unlike me, those two
are Super S-Rank Akudama.

00:18:31.194 --> 00:18:34.489 position:50% align:center
Meaning you can slaughter
them with no repercussions.

00:18:34.572 --> 00:18:39.369 position:50% align:center
Uh! Don't tell me you
sympathize with Akudama now.

00:18:46.042 --> 00:18:47.335 position:50% align:center
[SISTER]
Stop it!

00:18:47.419 --> 00:18:49.546 position:50% align:center
Big Sis hasn't done anything
wrong, don't kill her!

00:18:49.629 --> 00:18:51.840 position:50% align:center
Why are you trying to
protect this woman?

00:18:51.923 --> 00:18:54.300 position:50% align:center
I'd only be executing a...

00:19:01.433 --> 00:19:02.726 position:50% align:center
[COURIER grunts]

00:19:02.809 --> 00:19:04.644 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR]
For crying out loud...

00:19:04.728 --> 00:19:06.938 position:50% align:center
Why can't you people
just do what you're told?

00:19:07.022 --> 00:19:08.690 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:08.773 --> 00:19:11.443 position:50% align:center
[PILOT A muffled]
Pick up! Kansai Station!

00:19:11.526 --> 00:19:14.571 position:50% align:center
[PUPIL] The radio? I thought
waves couldn't get through.

00:19:14.654 --> 00:19:17.449 position:50% align:center
[PILOT A] Come in! The crowd
is rushing Kansai Station!

00:19:17.532 --> 00:19:20.785 position:50% align:center
The Shinkansen! They're
heading straight for it!

00:19:20.869 --> 00:19:21.870 position:50% align:center
What?

00:19:21.953 --> 00:19:25.415 position:50% align:center
[CROWD chattering]

00:19:30.086 --> 00:19:32.422 position:50% align:center
What the hell is this?

00:19:32.505 --> 00:19:33.923 position:50% align:center
Uh, wait.

00:19:34.007 --> 00:19:37.802 position:50% align:center
I don't get what's happening!
I never planned for this--

00:19:40.263 --> 00:19:44.309 position:50% align:center
I did it just like you taught
me. Bet you regret that--

00:19:47.896 --> 00:19:54.819 position:50% align:center
Y'know, bro, you sure fought
some tough dudes, huh?

00:19:54.903 --> 00:20:03.370 position:50% align:center
You were... the best...
there was... my bro...

00:20:05.872 --> 00:20:07.874 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN B]
We beg you, take us to Kanto!

00:20:07.957 --> 00:20:09.292 position:50% align:center
--[WOMAN C] Save us!
--[MAN D] Oh, Shinkansen!

00:20:09.376 --> 00:20:11.878 position:50% align:center
[ORDINARY]
How'd all these people get here?

00:20:12.962 --> 00:20:14.005 position:50% align:center
[PUPIL]
Hang in there!

00:20:14.089 --> 00:20:17.425 position:50% align:center
Please Ma'am.
Pull it out. Hurry.

00:20:17.509 --> 00:20:20.762 position:50% align:center
If I do, you'll die! We have
to get you to a hospital.

00:20:23.598 --> 00:20:27.811 position:50% align:center
Hold on. I won't let
you die on my watch!

00:20:27.894 --> 00:20:31.856 position:50% align:center
Promise me you'll live on.

00:20:41.741 --> 00:20:45.286 position:50% align:center
[CIVILIAN E] See how the
Shinkansen is merciful?

00:20:54.504 --> 00:20:57.007 position:50% align:center
[gasps] It's moving again!

00:21:01.636 --> 00:21:03.054 position:50% align:center
Get on.

00:23:00.338 --> 00:23:02.882 position:50% align:center
[BUNNY] Oof. What a mess
it's become out there.

00:23:02.966 --> 00:23:05.301 position:50% align:center
[SHARK sighs] Guess they're
coming to this side.

00:23:05.385 --> 00:23:08.179 position:50% align:center
[BUNNY]
Oh! Heyo! It's your pal, Bunny!

00:23:08.263 --> 00:23:09.931 position:50% align:center
[SHARK]
And Shark!

00:23:10.015 --> 00:23:12.434 position:50% align:center
[BUNNY] So, uh.
Question for ya, Sharkie!

00:23:12.517 --> 00:23:14.060 position:50% align:center
Do you know why so many people

00:23:14.144 --> 00:23:16.146 position:50% align:center
were able to get into
Kansai Station?

00:23:16.229 --> 00:23:19.733 position:50% align:center
[SHARK] Sure do, Bunny! It's
because Kanto wanted 'em all!

00:23:19.816 --> 00:23:21.443 position:50% align:center
They threw the doors wide open

00:23:21.526 --> 00:23:23.695 position:50% align:center
so that everyone could
come on through!

00:23:23.778 --> 00:23:25.238 position:50% align:center
[BUNNY]
Right-o!

00:23:25.321 --> 00:23:27.824 position:50% align:center
It's what the Shinkansen was
originally made for, after all!

00:23:27.907 --> 00:23:30.702 position:50% align:center
[SHARK]
Yup, yup! Because Kanto is--

00:23:44.049 --> 00:23:46.926 position:50% align:center
[HACKER]
Now... It's game time!
