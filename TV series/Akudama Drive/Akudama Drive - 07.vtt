[gasping]

00:00:18.518 --> 00:00:20.186 position:50% align:center
What is that?

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.189 position:50% align:center
An elevator--to take us below.

00:00:23.273 --> 00:00:25.692 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I kinda figured,
but why here?

00:00:25.775 --> 00:00:28.403 position:50% align:center
Whatever's down there
must be pretty important,

00:00:28.486 --> 00:00:29.612 position:50% align:center
otherwise they
wouldn't have gone

00:00:29.696 --> 00:00:31.698 position:50% align:center
to such great lengths
to conceal it.

00:00:31.781 --> 00:00:33.658 position:50% align:center
You'll see soon enough.

00:00:35.577 --> 00:00:36.870 position:50% align:center
Hey!

00:00:36.953 --> 00:00:38.371 position:50% align:center
[ORDINARY]
It's Hoodlum!

00:00:38.455 --> 00:00:40.415 position:50% align:center
[HOODLUM] Took a while,
but I finally caught up!

00:00:40.498 --> 00:00:42.083 position:50% align:center
[ORDINARY]
Glad you made it out safe!

00:00:42.167 --> 00:00:43.668 position:50% align:center
Man. It's a good thing

00:00:43.752 --> 00:00:46.379 position:50% align:center
I asked Courier where this
place was ahead of time!

00:00:46.463 --> 00:00:50.008 position:50% align:center
Wait blood. Are you okay?
What happened?

00:00:53.303 --> 00:00:55.430 position:50% align:center
You, uh... You may
not believe this,

00:00:55.513 --> 00:00:56.890 position:50% align:center
but I straight up massacred

00:00:56.973 --> 00:00:59.225 position:50% align:center
that Executioner
chick back there!

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.770 position:50% align:center
Twas a battle of life and death!

00:01:01.853 --> 00:01:04.105 position:50% align:center
I'm only alive thanks
to how awesome I am!

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:06.107 position:50% align:center
Stabbed her! Right in the eye!

00:01:06.191 --> 00:01:08.026 position:50% align:center
So don't worry, this
blood's hers, not mine.

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:09.778 position:50% align:center
And look at me! Not a scratch!

00:01:09.861 --> 00:01:11.571 position:50% align:center
That's a 500-million-year
sentence for yah, baby!

00:01:11.654 --> 00:01:12.822 position:50% align:center
[ORDINARY]
Hoodlum? Not to interrupt.

00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:15.075 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR]
And the dreadlocked oaf?

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.413 position:50% align:center
He didn't make it.

00:01:21.706 --> 00:01:24.084 position:50% align:center
[ORDINARY] This is Brawler
we're talking about!

00:01:24.167 --> 00:01:26.836 position:50% align:center
I bet he'll show up
half-dead any minute!

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.963 position:50% align:center
Right? Who's the Swindler here--

00:01:29.047 --> 00:01:31.883 position:50% align:center
He and the Executioner
took each other out.

00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:34.427 position:50% align:center
The guy is dead.

00:01:34.511 --> 00:01:36.221 position:50% align:center
[ORDINARY]
No way...

00:01:36.304 --> 00:01:39.015 position:50% align:center
[BROTHER] If he really
did die, then oh well.

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:43.269 position:50% align:center
Survival wasn't guaranteed.
This one's on him.

00:01:43.353 --> 00:01:45.438 position:50% align:center
Anyway, we should
board the elevator.

00:01:45.522 --> 00:01:47.607 position:50% align:center
I'd like to get there
as soon as possible.

00:01:47.691 --> 00:01:49.943 position:50% align:center
What in the hell do you
mean by, "Oh well"?

00:01:50.026 --> 00:01:53.029 position:50% align:center
My bro died 'cause of you and
that's all you gotta say? Huh?

00:01:53.113 --> 00:01:55.323 position:50% align:center
You can hit me if
you think it'll help.

00:01:55.407 --> 00:01:58.576 position:50% align:center
Feel free to stab me or
shoot me if you'd prefer.

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.745 position:50% align:center
We're used to that
sort of thing.

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:02.247 position:50% align:center
I may just take you up
on the offer!

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:03.456 position:50% align:center
[ORDINARY]
Let go of him!

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.876 position:50% align:center
I'm upset, too, but this
won't change things!

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.586 position:50% align:center
[ORDINARY gasps]

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.214 position:50% align:center
[ORDINARY]
You okay?

00:02:13.425 --> 00:02:15.760 position:50% align:center
[COURIER]
Keep your feelings out of work.

00:02:17.554 --> 00:02:18.930 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:03:52.774 --> 00:03:56.611 position:50% align:center
[CUTTHROAT] Pretty red.
Pretty red. Pretty red!

00:04:01.074 --> 00:04:03.076 position:50% align:center
Let's all relax.

00:04:04.411 --> 00:04:07.664 position:50% align:center
[HOODLUM]
I, uh... I saw you drop this.

00:04:09.666 --> 00:04:13.086 position:50% align:center
[HOODLUM] And sorry. I shouldn't
have lost my temper earlier.

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:16.297 position:50% align:center
No, you're fine.
I spoke out of line.

00:04:16.381 --> 00:04:19.009 position:50% align:center
Besides, we've been
using you anyway.

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:22.637 position:50% align:center
[ORDINARY sighs]

00:04:22.721 --> 00:04:24.681 position:50% align:center
That thing is important to you,
it's good it wasn't lost.

00:04:24.764 --> 00:04:26.182 position:50% align:center
Quiet!

00:04:26.266 --> 00:04:28.727 position:50% align:center
If that's true, you should
probably put it somewhere safe.

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.270 position:50% align:center
[BROTHER]
Mind your own business.

00:04:30.353 --> 00:04:32.147 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR]
Not to spoil everyone's fun,

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.441 position:50% align:center
but how much longer are we
riding this thing down for?

00:04:34.524 --> 00:04:38.111 position:50% align:center
We should be coming
to a stop about now.

00:04:42.282 --> 00:04:44.534 position:50% align:center
Finally time for
the grand reveal.

00:04:44.617 --> 00:04:46.828 position:50% align:center
Let's see this destination.

00:04:46.911 --> 00:04:49.164 position:50% align:center
I imagine if Hacker
were here with us,

00:04:49.247 --> 00:04:51.916 position:50% align:center
he'd be more excited
than anyone.

00:05:02.635 --> 00:05:04.554 position:50% align:center
What is all this?

00:05:04.637 --> 00:05:10.268 position:50% align:center
We've arrived at Expo Park.
And that is our destination.

00:05:15.148 --> 00:05:16.983 position:50% align:center
[BUNNY]
Heyo! Bunny here!

00:05:17.067 --> 00:05:19.361 position:50% align:center
[SHARK]
And you pal Shark!

00:05:19.444 --> 00:05:20.779 position:50% align:center
[BUNNY]
Hey, hey, Sharkie!

00:05:20.862 --> 00:05:23.323 position:50% align:center
Can you imagine what Kansai
was like before the war?

00:05:23.406 --> 00:05:24.991 position:50% align:center
[SHARK]
Uh, heck to the no!

00:05:25.075 --> 00:05:27.827 position:50% align:center
[BUNNY] Right? Well,
back in Old Kansai,

00:05:27.911 --> 00:05:29.746 position:50% align:center
the people wanted to
preserve their culture,

00:05:29.829 --> 00:05:32.290 position:50% align:center
so future generations,
like ones after the war,

00:05:32.374 --> 00:05:33.750 position:50% align:center
could learn all about it!

00:05:33.833 --> 00:05:36.503 position:50% align:center
[SHARK] Oh! You mean
they built a museum?

00:05:36.586 --> 00:05:38.505 position:50% align:center
[BUNNY]
Think bigger, my finned friend!

00:05:38.588 --> 00:05:39.923 position:50% align:center
[SHARK]
Huh?

00:05:40.006 --> 00:05:41.341 position:50% align:center
[BUNNY] They tried to preserve
an entire little city.

00:05:41.424 --> 00:05:43.259 position:50% align:center
Like a gigantic
exhibition center!

00:05:43.343 --> 00:05:45.470 position:50% align:center
[SHARK]
Whoa! A whole city?

00:05:45.553 --> 00:05:48.848 position:50% align:center
Kansai really spared
no expense! Wait...

00:05:48.932 --> 00:05:52.185 position:50% align:center
But if it's that huge, then how
come I've ever seen it before?

00:05:52.268 --> 00:05:53.687 position:50% align:center
[BUNNY]
Great question!

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:56.272 position:50% align:center
That's because it got buried
underground during the war.

00:05:56.356 --> 00:05:58.858 position:50% align:center
[SHARK] So you're saying
if I get myself a shovel,

00:05:58.942 --> 00:06:00.819 position:50% align:center
there's a chance
I might find it?

00:06:00.902 --> 00:06:04.489 position:50% align:center
Wowwie, then I could learn all
sorts of stuff about the past!

00:06:04.572 --> 00:06:08.201 position:50% align:center
[BUNNY] Some things you're
better off not knowing.

00:06:08.284 --> 00:06:10.912 position:50% align:center
[SHARK, BUNNY]
Well, until next time!

00:06:16.668 --> 00:06:19.879 position:50% align:center
Whoa. This place has
some weird buildings.

00:06:19.963 --> 00:06:22.132 position:50% align:center
[BROTHER] From what I heard,
they were constructed

00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:25.260 position:50% align:center
to replicate the look and feel
of some kind of festival.

00:06:25.343 --> 00:06:27.637 position:50% align:center
The past definitely seems
a lot more whimsical.

00:06:27.721 --> 00:06:29.806 position:50% align:center
Hey! Look, Courier!

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:31.683 position:50% align:center
Did you see this cool-looking
bike right here?

00:06:31.766 --> 00:06:32.809 position:50% align:center
It's wacky!

00:06:32.892 --> 00:06:34.144 position:50% align:center
[COURIER]
S'not a bike.

00:06:34.227 --> 00:06:37.272 position:50% align:center
[HOODLUM] Check out these
funky clothes! Yo, Bro!

00:06:37.355 --> 00:06:38.982 position:50% align:center
[ORDINARY] So your definition
of a bike depends

00:06:39.065 --> 00:06:41.151 position:50% align:center
entirely on whether
it has tires?

00:06:41.234 --> 00:06:43.319 position:50% align:center
[CUTTHROAT]
What's with all the faded red?

00:06:43.403 --> 00:06:46.406 position:50% align:center
[ORDINARY] Faded red?
I think you mean "orange"?

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:53.413 position:50% align:center
No matter the era, scientists
have had the same dream.

00:06:56.416 --> 00:06:58.043 position:50% align:center
[BROTHER]
We're close.

00:06:59.753 --> 00:07:01.588 position:50% align:center
[BROTHER]
Almost there!

00:07:06.217 --> 00:07:08.887 position:50% align:center
It's even bigger than I thought
once you get up close to it!

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:11.556 position:50% align:center
We're here. Finally!

00:07:13.892 --> 00:07:16.603 position:50% align:center
You've been trying to reach
this tower, I got that.

00:07:16.686 --> 00:07:19.022 position:50% align:center
Where I'm lost is why
it's so important to you.

00:07:19.105 --> 00:07:20.648 position:50% align:center
Do you mind filling us in?

00:07:20.732 --> 00:07:22.359 position:50% align:center
[BROTHER] I don't know if
you'd even believe me,

00:07:22.442 --> 00:07:23.777 position:50% align:center
but before the war,

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:26.363 position:50% align:center
humans used to leave this
planet and go into space.

00:07:26.446 --> 00:07:30.116 position:50% align:center
Hold on, space? Like beyond
the sky? That space?

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:30.992 position:50% align:center
Ah...

00:07:31.076 --> 00:07:32.994 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:07:34.913 --> 00:07:38.541 position:50% align:center
[BROTHER] And this tower is a
vehicle built to get you there:

00:07:38.625 --> 00:07:40.627 position:50% align:center
a rocket.

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:47.384 position:50% align:center
Crazy. Wait a sec. Where exactly
are you going with this?

00:07:47.467 --> 00:07:50.095 position:50% align:center
Before the war,
humans made a base

00:07:50.178 --> 00:07:52.555 position:50% align:center
that would allow them
to explore up there.

00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:53.890 position:50% align:center
But there's no air,

00:07:53.973 --> 00:07:56.643 position:50% align:center
and day and night differ
by 200 degrees.

00:07:56.726 --> 00:07:59.270 position:50% align:center
Nothing can survive
the harsh conditions.

00:07:59.354 --> 00:08:00.397 position:50% align:center
You don't mean...

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:05.694 position:50% align:center
I do. We're heading to the moon.

00:08:05.777 --> 00:08:08.154 position:50% align:center
It's the perfect place for us.

00:08:08.238 --> 00:08:12.325 position:50% align:center
Nobody will be able
to reach Sister and me.

00:08:12.409 --> 00:08:14.619 position:50% align:center
But it's so far.

00:08:14.703 --> 00:08:19.207 position:50% align:center
[BROTHER] There's no choice. We
have to escape, no matter what.

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:26.464 position:50% align:center
Because we shoulder the
lives of our 5,555 siblings.

00:08:26.548 --> 00:08:30.635 position:50% align:center
Will you tell me one thing?
Who are you kids?

00:08:30.719 --> 00:08:35.015 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Okay, fine,
we'll tell you our story.

00:08:35.098 --> 00:08:38.727 position:50% align:center
Where we're from and the
kind of beings we are.

00:08:46.693 --> 00:08:49.404 position:50% align:center
Good grief. The least
they could've done is

00:08:49.487 --> 00:08:52.824 position:50% align:center
given me a body
that doesn't feel pain.

00:09:00.373 --> 00:09:04.085 position:50% align:center
[CHILDREN chattering, laughing]

00:09:04.169 --> 00:09:06.755 position:50% align:center
Hey, you all right?

00:09:08.256 --> 00:09:10.717 position:50% align:center
[BROTHER]
I guess. Kinda hurt, though.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.469 position:50% align:center
I'm just glad you're okay!

00:09:12.552 --> 00:09:15.972 position:50% align:center
I want to know why he's the only
one who gets experimented on.

00:09:16.056 --> 00:09:18.391 position:50% align:center
Do you think they'll suddenly
start doing the same tests

00:09:18.475 --> 00:09:19.559 position:50% align:center
on us someday?

00:09:19.642 --> 00:09:22.062 position:50% align:center
Wh-What? Eww, no!
I bet it hurts.

00:09:22.145 --> 00:09:23.855 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it can be pretty painful.

00:09:23.938 --> 00:09:26.191 position:50% align:center
I don't get why they
have to do it every day.

00:09:26.274 --> 00:09:28.401 position:50% align:center
You would think they
could give you a break.

00:09:28.485 --> 00:09:29.903 position:50% align:center
Can you, Professor?

00:09:29.986 --> 00:09:31.863 position:50% align:center
[PROFESSOR]
I don't have that authority.

00:09:31.946 --> 00:09:32.864 position:50% align:center
Aw...

00:09:32.947 --> 00:09:35.575 position:50% align:center
It's fine once you
get used to it.

00:09:43.625 --> 00:09:45.377 position:50% align:center
Hey! Good today, too?

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:47.420 position:50% align:center
Eh, more or less.

00:09:51.966 --> 00:09:53.176 position:50% align:center
Hey, welcome back!

00:09:53.259 --> 00:09:54.552 position:50% align:center
Thanks, guys.

00:09:58.598 --> 00:10:00.141 position:50% align:center
That didn't take long today!

00:10:00.225 --> 00:10:02.936 position:50% align:center
You're right, they must
be getting used to it.

00:10:05.563 --> 00:10:06.981 position:50% align:center
Oh. You're all done?

00:10:07.065 --> 00:10:09.484 position:50% align:center
Yep, they chopped my
head off twice this time!

00:10:09.567 --> 00:10:12.529 position:50% align:center
[BOY A] Oh by the way,
we have a present for you!

00:10:12.612 --> 00:10:14.072 position:50% align:center
Ta-da!

00:10:14.155 --> 00:10:16.616 position:50% align:center
[BOY A] We made it from the
loose threads on our uniforms!

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:19.119 position:50% align:center
It's nothing special, but we
wanted to give it to you.

00:10:19.202 --> 00:10:21.037 position:50% align:center
No, It's great. Thank you.

00:10:21.121 --> 00:10:23.498 position:50% align:center
Be sure not to hang it
around your neck, though!

00:10:23.581 --> 00:10:26.209 position:50% align:center
Or you might end up losing it!

00:10:26.292 --> 00:10:27.669 position:50% align:center
Good point!

00:10:27.752 --> 00:10:30.880 position:50% align:center
[BOY A sighs] It'd be nice
if the experiment ends soon.

00:10:30.964 --> 00:10:34.134 position:50% align:center
[BOY B] Too bad the Professor
won't help out. He's useless!

00:10:34.217 --> 00:10:35.844 position:50% align:center
[PROFESSOR]
I am simply an AI

00:10:35.927 --> 00:10:38.138 position:50% align:center
programmed to observe
and instruct you.

00:10:38.221 --> 00:10:41.141 position:50% align:center
No matter what the request,
I'm not allowed to fulfill it.

00:10:41.224 --> 00:10:42.142 position:50% align:center
Told you.

00:10:42.225 --> 00:10:43.685 position:50% align:center
Fine then.

00:10:43.768 --> 00:10:45.979 position:50% align:center
I guess we'll just have to go
directly to the headmaster.

00:10:46.062 --> 00:10:49.274 position:50% align:center
If anyone can stop the
experiments, it's him!

00:10:49.357 --> 00:10:51.317 position:50% align:center
You're right.
Maybe he'll listen

00:10:51.401 --> 00:10:53.862 position:50% align:center
if we all show up there
and plead with him.

00:10:53.945 --> 00:10:57.240 position:50% align:center
[BROTHER] It's not a big deal.
I'm all right, really.

00:10:57.323 --> 00:11:00.869 position:50% align:center
And besides, if you ask, I'm
afraid it'll make the headmaster

00:11:00.952 --> 00:11:05.081 position:50% align:center
angry, and then everyone might
end up being tested on.

00:11:05.165 --> 00:11:06.958 position:50% align:center
Is that really what
you're worried about?

00:11:07.042 --> 00:11:08.960 position:50% align:center
We're your siblings, remember?

00:11:09.044 --> 00:11:10.378 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:17.052 --> 00:11:18.303 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:18.386 --> 00:11:20.805 position:50% align:center
[PROFESSOR]
The experiment is complete.

00:11:24.225 --> 00:11:25.894 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:39.699 --> 00:11:43.244 position:50% align:center
Where are they? Where did
all the other kids go?

00:11:46.456 --> 00:11:49.084 position:50% align:center
[HEADMASTER]
Hello, Experiment 2502.

00:11:49.167 --> 00:11:52.087 position:50% align:center
I have rather good news
to share with you today.

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:54.130 position:50% align:center
You're the headmaster.

00:11:54.214 --> 00:11:57.676 position:50% align:center
[HEADMASTER] Congratulations,
Experiment 2502.

00:11:57.759 --> 00:12:00.804 position:50% align:center
You are officially
the first to graduate.

00:12:00.887 --> 00:12:03.223 position:50% align:center
But Headmaster,
where are the others?

00:12:03.306 --> 00:12:05.433 position:50% align:center
[HEADMASTER] At long last,
we have produced an offering

00:12:05.517 --> 00:12:07.352 position:50% align:center
worthy of sending to Kanto.

00:12:07.435 --> 00:12:09.145 position:50% align:center
Please just tell me
where they went.

00:12:09.229 --> 00:12:10.689 position:50% align:center
[HEADMASTER]
We're confident we can create

00:12:10.772 --> 00:12:13.608 position:50% align:center
more graduates thanks
to our success with you.

00:12:13.692 --> 00:12:15.443 position:50% align:center
How come you're not
answering me?

00:12:15.527 --> 00:12:17.612 position:50% align:center
[HEADMASTER]
But you alone are not enough.

00:12:17.696 --> 00:12:20.073 position:50% align:center
We will have to produce
a second graduate.

00:12:20.156 --> 00:12:21.491 position:50% align:center
Where has everyone gone?!

00:12:21.574 --> 00:12:22.867 position:50% align:center
[HEADMASTER]
Be patient.

00:12:22.951 --> 00:12:26.538 position:50% align:center
Rest assured, the others
will be graduating with you.

00:12:35.255 --> 00:12:40.677 position:50% align:center
[gasps] What the--?
This can't be real!

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:45.015 position:50% align:center
[HEADMASTER] Why are you acting
so surprised, Experiment 2502?

00:12:45.098 --> 00:12:49.644 position:50% align:center
After all, you were created
using 2,501 children.

00:12:49.728 --> 00:12:50.854 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:12:50.937 --> 00:12:53.773 position:50% align:center
[HEADMASTER] Professor,
have you not told him?

00:12:53.857 --> 00:12:55.066 position:50% align:center
[PROFESSOR]
Forgive me,

00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:57.694 position:50% align:center
but to preserve his mental
fortitude I did not.

00:12:57.777 --> 00:13:00.155 position:50% align:center
[HEADMASTER]
No matter. I'll explain now.

00:13:00.238 --> 00:13:02.699 position:50% align:center
Over time, we have
produced many children

00:13:02.782 --> 00:13:06.119 position:50% align:center
who carry a special gene
needed for immortality.

00:13:06.202 --> 00:13:09.164 position:50% align:center
Those subjects were then
concentrated into a pool.

00:13:09.247 --> 00:13:11.958 position:50% align:center
From which, we were able
to produce a child

00:13:12.042 --> 00:13:14.502 position:50% align:center
with the desired immortal trait.

00:13:14.586 --> 00:13:19.424 position:50% align:center
In other words, you,
Experiment 2502.

00:13:19.507 --> 00:13:21.468 position:50% align:center
From the pool
you're standing upon,

00:13:21.551 --> 00:13:23.762 position:50% align:center
we will produce
one other graduate.

00:13:23.845 --> 00:13:26.723 position:50% align:center
Soon, we will begin
mass production.

00:13:26.806 --> 00:13:30.477 position:50% align:center
Then many more of your siblings
will join you in Kanto.

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:32.854 position:50% align:center
Please look forward to it.

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:58.129 position:50% align:center
[PROFESSOR] This is Experiment
5557. Your new sibling.

00:13:59.589 --> 00:14:03.760 position:50% align:center
Hello, there. Do you
know what a sibling is?

00:14:03.843 --> 00:14:07.597 position:50% align:center
There's nothing else like it.
Siblings share a powerful bond.

00:14:07.681 --> 00:14:10.850 position:50% align:center
A connection that ties
them to each other.

00:14:10.934 --> 00:14:14.354 position:50% align:center
Both of us are the product
of many of our siblings.

00:14:14.437 --> 00:14:15.647 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:17.732 position:50% align:center
[BROTHER] It's fine if
you don't understand.

00:14:17.816 --> 00:14:21.986 position:50% align:center
What's important is this:
us two are brother and sister,

00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:24.447 position:50% align:center
and brothers are supposed
to protect their sisters,

00:14:24.531 --> 00:14:27.534 position:50% align:center
no matter what. Okay?

00:14:28.535 --> 00:14:33.164 position:50% align:center
If you come with me, I promise
I'll always protect you!

00:14:35.208 --> 00:14:38.586 position:50% align:center
Bro... ther...

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:46.469 position:50% align:center
[PROFESSOR]
Do you have everything?

00:14:46.553 --> 00:14:49.180 position:50% align:center
We'll be fine as long
as I have my backpack.

00:14:49.264 --> 00:14:52.934 position:50% align:center
[PROFESSOR] Good. I will now
shut down all of the systems.

00:14:53.018 --> 00:14:56.104 position:50% align:center
You two will be on your own,
just as planned.

00:14:56.187 --> 00:14:58.189 position:50% align:center
Thank you, Professor.

00:14:58.273 --> 00:15:00.608 position:50% align:center
[PROFESSOR] This is what they
get for programming compassion

00:15:00.692 --> 00:15:05.530 position:50% align:center
into an AI. Don't mention it.
This is goodbye.

00:15:05.613 --> 00:15:07.490 position:50% align:center
I wish you both luck.

00:15:16.332 --> 00:15:20.253 position:50% align:center
That's interesting.
Could be useful.

00:15:20.337 --> 00:15:22.339 position:50% align:center
We stick together,
no matter what.

00:15:22.422 --> 00:15:25.425 position:50% align:center
We'll escape this fate
and choose our own.

00:15:47.113 --> 00:15:50.367 position:50% align:center
And of course, all of you were
there for the rest of the story.

00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:53.870 position:50% align:center
The truth comes out. You're
offerings meant for Kanto.

00:15:53.953 --> 00:15:57.040 position:50% align:center
Who'd have thought they
would discover immortality.

00:15:57.123 --> 00:15:59.084 position:50% align:center
A fascinating twist.

00:15:59.167 --> 00:16:01.628 position:50% align:center
[CUTTHROAT] Sounds boring
to kill without them dying.

00:16:01.711 --> 00:16:03.588 position:50% align:center
It'd be better if they died.

00:16:03.672 --> 00:16:07.133 position:50% align:center
I think you and I are in
total agreement there.

00:16:07.217 --> 00:16:08.593 position:50% align:center
So are we done here?

00:16:08.677 --> 00:16:12.430 position:50% align:center
Whatever your story might be,
the job is over.

00:16:12.514 --> 00:16:13.765 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:16:17.185 --> 00:16:20.063 position:50% align:center
[BROTHER]
You all did well. Thank you.

00:16:22.982 --> 00:16:24.317 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:16:24.401 --> 00:16:26.111 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR]
Feels good to be free.

00:16:26.194 --> 00:16:28.822 position:50% align:center
[VOICE] Attention.
Three minutes until launch.

00:16:28.905 --> 00:16:32.492 position:50% align:center
Attention all crew.
Please finish preparations.

00:16:32.575 --> 00:16:33.660 position:50% align:center
[BROTHER]
This is goodbye.

00:16:33.743 --> 00:16:35.620 position:50% align:center
[VOICE] Prior to launch,
passengers must

00:16:35.704 --> 00:16:37.831 position:50% align:center
please remember to
fasten your air belts.

00:16:37.914 --> 00:16:39.958 position:50% align:center
Thank you for your cooperation.

00:16:40.041 --> 00:16:44.796 position:50% align:center
Hey, listen. I hope
you guys find happiness!

00:16:44.879 --> 00:16:47.257 position:50% align:center
[BROTHER]
It would be nice if we could.

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:49.592 position:50% align:center
[SISTER]
I wanna eat takoyaki again.

00:16:49.676 --> 00:16:51.761 position:50% align:center
Next time we meet,
you can munch on 'em

00:16:51.845 --> 00:16:54.431 position:50% align:center
until your belly's
completely stuffed.

00:16:55.682 --> 00:16:58.393 position:50% align:center
Someday, perhaps.

00:17:02.731 --> 00:17:05.025 position:50% align:center
[COURIER] You should really
leave your feelings out of work.

00:17:05.108 --> 00:17:06.609 position:50% align:center
But...

00:17:08.445 --> 00:17:10.071 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:13.908 --> 00:17:15.702 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR] I'm not convinced
keeping your feelings

00:17:15.785 --> 00:17:17.787 position:50% align:center
out of work is possible.

00:17:19.956 --> 00:17:23.376 position:50% align:center
No! Please! Hang in there!

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:24.461 position:50% align:center
[SISTER]
I'm fine.

00:17:24.544 --> 00:17:26.463 position:50% align:center
[ORDINARY gasping]

00:17:26.546 --> 00:17:29.549 position:50% align:center
[SISTER]
I said I'm fine.

00:17:29.632 --> 00:17:31.593 position:50% align:center
Well, there's proof
you're immortal, too.

00:17:31.676 --> 00:17:33.094 position:50% align:center
How could you?!

00:17:33.178 --> 00:17:35.513 position:50% align:center
Now be a good boy
and stay quiet for me.

00:17:35.597 --> 00:17:36.890 position:50% align:center
The hell are you doing?!

00:17:36.973 --> 00:17:40.810 position:50% align:center
Oh, sweetie pie, it's obvious.

00:17:40.894 --> 00:17:42.103 position:50% align:center
[whimpers]

00:17:42.187 --> 00:17:45.315 position:50% align:center
Hey, Doctor, since you
had the nerve to do that,

00:17:45.398 --> 00:17:47.442 position:50% align:center
I take it you want
me to kill you?

00:17:47.525 --> 00:17:48.860 position:50% align:center
Must be nice,

00:17:48.943 --> 00:17:50.945 position:50% align:center
being some little princess
who always gets protected.

00:17:51.029 --> 00:17:52.989 position:50% align:center
'Scuse me?

00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:58.787 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR]
Took you long enough, Boss.

00:17:58.870 --> 00:18:01.748 position:50% align:center
All right! Positions, everyone!

00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:08.713 position:50% align:center
But how?

00:18:10.423 --> 00:18:13.510 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR] By the way, they're
what was inside that vault.

00:18:13.593 --> 00:18:15.553 position:50% align:center
An offering to Kanto.

00:18:15.637 --> 00:18:17.889 position:50% align:center
We appreciate you
providing the info.

00:18:17.972 --> 00:18:19.974 position:50% align:center
Please handle the
goods with care.

00:18:20.058 --> 00:18:23.061 position:50% align:center
What? You're working
with them? Doctor!

00:18:23.144 --> 00:18:24.854 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR] I don't have to
tell you a damn thing

00:18:24.938 --> 00:18:26.606 position:50% align:center
if I don't feel like it.

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:29.651 position:50% align:center
I just did what was
good for me, that's all.

00:18:29.734 --> 00:18:30.860 position:50% align:center
Who would have ever thought

00:18:30.944 --> 00:18:34.155 position:50% align:center
we'd end up collaborating
with an Akudama?

00:18:36.157 --> 00:18:38.159 position:50% align:center
I'm not gonna
let you capture us!

00:18:38.243 --> 00:18:39.911 position:50% align:center
Sister and I are
going to the moon!

00:18:39.994 --> 00:18:42.497 position:50% align:center
Don't be ridiculous,
you can't go to the moon.

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:45.000 position:50% align:center
We can! That's the whole
reason we came here!

00:18:45.083 --> 00:18:48.211 position:50% align:center
Dumb brat. You would just die,
there's no oxygen.

00:18:48.294 --> 00:18:50.672 position:50% align:center
Besides, what you
think is the moon

00:18:50.755 --> 00:18:52.382 position:50% align:center
is nothing more
than an illusion.

00:18:52.465 --> 00:18:53.842 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:53.925 --> 00:18:57.429 position:50% align:center
[BOSS] It wasn't just Earth
that saw the scars of war.

00:18:57.512 --> 00:18:59.222 position:50% align:center
No way.

00:18:59.305 --> 00:19:02.642 position:50% align:center
[BOSS] The flames of battle
burned like wildfire.

00:19:02.726 --> 00:19:07.981 position:50% align:center
And as a result,
the Moon was destroyed!

00:19:08.064 --> 00:19:09.274 position:50% align:center
[BROTHER gasping]

00:19:09.357 --> 00:19:12.193 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR] That's enough.
Playtime's over.

00:19:12.277 --> 00:19:15.363 position:50% align:center
With that, the cargo
has been recovered.

00:19:15.447 --> 00:19:17.323 position:50% align:center
You attacked the Shinkansen

00:19:17.407 --> 00:19:22.078 position:50% align:center
and stole an offering to Kanto
from the vault onboard.

00:19:22.162 --> 00:19:23.663 position:50% align:center
Your sentence is death.

00:19:23.747 --> 00:19:25.957 position:50% align:center
[EXECUTIONERS yelling]

00:19:32.881 --> 00:19:34.049 position:50% align:center
Thanks for the cover!

00:19:34.132 --> 00:19:36.217 position:50% align:center
You shit!

00:19:36.301 --> 00:19:38.553 position:50% align:center
All right. Just find
an escape route!

00:19:38.636 --> 00:19:42.265 position:50% align:center
We're okay. It's okay!
We'll find a way out--

00:19:42.349 --> 00:19:46.478 position:50% align:center
Nice dodge there, Swindler.
I won't miss again.

00:19:48.021 --> 00:19:51.649 position:50% align:center
[CUTTHROAT] Get lost. You have
no right to be killing.

00:19:51.733 --> 00:19:53.526 position:50% align:center
Thanks Mister Cutthroat.

00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:55.528 position:50% align:center
[EXECUTIONER B]
He's the one who escaped!

00:19:55.612 --> 00:19:57.280 position:50% align:center
Guess we'll perform
the beheading here.

00:19:57.364 --> 00:19:59.783 position:50% align:center
[EXECUTIONERS yelling]

00:19:59.866 --> 00:20:01.493 position:50% align:center
[ORDINARY yelps]

00:20:01.576 --> 00:20:04.162 position:50% align:center
[EXECUTIONER F groans]

00:20:04.245 --> 00:20:06.873 position:50% align:center
Yeesh, you're so persistent!

00:20:06.956 --> 00:20:09.209 position:50% align:center
You're mine!

00:20:09.292 --> 00:20:10.627 position:50% align:center
I missed?

00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:14.381 position:50% align:center
Aw, man! Gimme a break!
I just got my legs reattached!

00:20:17.801 --> 00:20:22.097 position:50% align:center
[CUTTHROAT chuckles]
This thing's pretty cool!

00:20:24.683 --> 00:20:27.018 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR]
I held up my end of the bargain.

00:20:27.102 --> 00:20:30.063 position:50% align:center
It's hard to believe a child
was Kansai's offering.

00:20:30.146 --> 00:20:32.982 position:50% align:center
Ahem, and I believe you had
something for me as well?

00:20:33.066 --> 00:20:35.276 position:50% align:center
Executioners keep their word.

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:39.155 position:50% align:center
So as we discussed, we'll take
you off the Akudama list.

00:20:39.239 --> 00:20:42.283 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR laughs]
Much appreciated.

00:20:45.078 --> 00:20:47.914 position:50% align:center
[gasps] I...

00:20:51.001 --> 00:20:54.254 position:50% align:center
I promised I'd protect you!

00:20:54.337 --> 00:20:56.464 position:50% align:center
--Damn brat!
--No!

00:20:59.467 --> 00:21:00.760 position:50% align:center
[BROTHER]
This way!

00:21:02.095 --> 00:21:03.596 position:50% align:center
[ORDINARY]
Hold on a sec!

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:04.764 position:50% align:center
[BROTHER]
Get in.

00:21:04.848 --> 00:21:05.849 position:50% align:center
In the rocket?

00:21:05.932 --> 00:21:07.475 position:50% align:center
--Yes! Come on!
--[ORDINARY] Hey! Wait!

00:21:07.559 --> 00:21:10.020 position:50% align:center
Just run! As far as you can!

00:21:10.103 --> 00:21:11.938 position:50% align:center
--[ORDINARY] Hang on!
--[SISTER] Brother!

00:21:14.899 --> 00:21:17.861 position:50% align:center
Where the hell did that
bright light come from?

00:21:17.944 --> 00:21:20.572 position:50% align:center
Must have been the
end of the tunnel.

00:21:22.115 --> 00:21:23.450 position:50% align:center
Quite the act of desperation.

00:21:23.533 --> 00:21:25.994 position:50% align:center
[BOSS] What're you waiting for?
Go secure the offering!

00:21:29.914 --> 00:21:31.958 position:50% align:center
This is goodbye.

00:21:46.056 --> 00:21:48.016 position:50% align:center
[EXECUTIONER G]
The offering's secured!

00:21:48.099 --> 00:21:49.517 position:50% align:center
[BROTHER grunting]

00:21:53.229 --> 00:21:55.106 position:50% align:center
Run away!

00:23:43.965 --> 00:23:46.468 position:50% align:center
[ORDINARY]
This is the only place I belong!
