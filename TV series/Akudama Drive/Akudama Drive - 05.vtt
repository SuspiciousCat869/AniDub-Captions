[ORDINARY gasps]

00:00:13.346 --> 00:00:16.433 position:50% align:center
[BRAWLER] Welp, it's been real,
but looks like the job's over.

00:00:16.516 --> 00:00:20.437 position:50% align:center
Thanks for a kickass good time,
guys. See ya around.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.813 position:50% align:center
Where are you going?

00:00:21.896 --> 00:00:23.773 position:50% align:center
Figured I'd head back
to Kansai, find that

00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:26.359 position:50% align:center
Executioner prick and whoop
his ass once and for all!

00:00:26.443 --> 00:00:28.153 position:50% align:center
What? But you almost died!

00:00:28.236 --> 00:00:30.530 position:50% align:center
Sounds like a waste of
my perfectly good first aid,

00:00:30.613 --> 00:00:32.073 position:50% align:center
if you ask me.

00:00:32.157 --> 00:00:34.492 position:50% align:center
Also, aren't you forgetting
about your cut of the reward?

00:00:34.576 --> 00:00:36.828 position:50% align:center
Heh. It was never
about the money.

00:00:36.911 --> 00:00:38.788 position:50% align:center
You guys can have
my share if you want.

00:00:38.872 --> 00:00:42.500 position:50% align:center
Nobody's ever scared
me before, till that guy.

00:00:42.584 --> 00:00:45.837 position:50% align:center
I'll beat him,
even if it kills me!

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.714 position:50% align:center
What do you mean?
Dying isn't winning!

00:00:47.797 --> 00:00:49.049 position:50% align:center
[BRAWLER]
Who said anything about dying?

00:00:49.132 --> 00:00:50.800 position:50% align:center
[ORDINARY]
You did! A second ago!

00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:52.594 position:50% align:center
Look, Miss Swindler.

00:00:52.677 --> 00:00:54.763 position:50% align:center
You just gotta let Bro
follow his heart,

00:00:54.846 --> 00:00:56.348 position:50% align:center
wherever it leads him.

00:00:56.431 --> 00:00:58.892 position:50% align:center
It's just the way he rolls.
Don't bother fightin' it.

00:00:58.975 --> 00:01:00.685 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR] Why don't you
go with him, tough guy?

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:01.853 position:50% align:center
Or are you afraid?

00:01:01.936 --> 00:01:03.980 position:50% align:center
What would someone
like me be afraid for?

00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:05.690 position:50% align:center
Back me up! If I tagged along,

00:01:05.774 --> 00:01:07.400 position:50% align:center
I'd only end up gettin'
in your way, right?

00:01:07.484 --> 00:01:08.610 position:50% align:center
Nah, come with, brother!

00:01:08.693 --> 00:01:10.195 position:50% align:center
I done goofed!

00:01:10.278 --> 00:01:12.405 position:50% align:center
[BROTHER] I'm afraid there's
been a misunderstanding.

00:01:12.489 --> 00:01:14.616 position:50% align:center
You haven't
completed the job yet.

00:01:14.699 --> 00:01:15.909 position:50% align:center
The hell you mean?

00:01:15.992 --> 00:01:18.203 position:50% align:center
We got you outta that
damn vault, didn't we?

00:01:18.286 --> 00:01:19.579 position:50% align:center
That's mission accomplished
right there!

00:01:19.662 --> 00:01:21.039 position:50% align:center
[BROTHER]
Were you listening to me at all

00:01:21.122 --> 00:01:22.916 position:50% align:center
during the hotel briefing?

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:25.043 position:50% align:center
Freeing us wasn't
the end of the job.

00:01:25.126 --> 00:01:27.003 position:50% align:center
You're supposed to deliver us.

00:01:27.087 --> 00:01:28.713 position:50% align:center
And we're not there yet.

00:01:28.797 --> 00:01:31.424 position:50% align:center
Do I look like a guy who
cares about the "specifics"?

00:01:31.508 --> 00:01:34.886 position:50% align:center
[BROTHER] Guess not. However,
our destination is also Kansai,

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:36.721 position:50% align:center
so I propose the following:

00:01:36.805 --> 00:01:38.932 position:50% align:center
Since we're headed in the
same direction as you,

00:01:39.015 --> 00:01:41.685 position:50% align:center
we might as well all
travel there together.

00:01:41.768 --> 00:01:43.186 position:50% align:center
Kay.

00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:46.356 position:50% align:center
Where in Kansai? You're gonna
have to be more specific.

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.442 position:50% align:center
I'll tell you once we've
gotten out of here.

00:02:01.538 --> 00:02:03.289 position:50% align:center
Something the matter?

00:02:03.373 --> 00:02:06.751 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna continue
on ahead to Kanto.

00:02:06.835 --> 00:02:09.129 position:50% align:center
What are you talking
about, Hacker?

00:02:09.212 --> 00:02:10.839 position:50% align:center
Didn't you hear what
Mister Kitty said

00:02:10.922 --> 00:02:12.924 position:50% align:center
about the Shinkansen's route?

00:02:13.008 --> 00:02:13.800 position:50% align:center
[HACKER]
Every word.

00:02:13.883 --> 00:02:15.260 position:50% align:center
Then why do it?

00:02:15.343 --> 00:02:18.388 position:50% align:center
Keep going and you'll die in
the Decontamination Zone!

00:02:18.471 --> 00:02:20.223 position:50% align:center
You know that!

00:02:20.306 --> 00:02:25.478 position:50% align:center
Because this may be the
only chance I ever get.

00:02:25.562 --> 00:02:27.439 position:50% align:center
Can you even imagine?

00:02:27.522 --> 00:02:30.150 position:50% align:center
What it's like to feel bored,
no matter what?

00:02:30.233 --> 00:02:33.778 position:50% align:center
I've tried to find things to
entertain myself, believe me.

00:02:33.862 --> 00:02:36.197 position:50% align:center
Nothing's ever enough.

00:02:36.281 --> 00:02:38.783 position:50% align:center
But things might be
different in Kanto.

00:02:38.867 --> 00:02:40.243 position:50% align:center
Every day, something fresh.

00:02:40.326 --> 00:02:44.205 position:50% align:center
Every day, something new.
Every day, something fun.

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:47.584 position:50% align:center
A world of excitement could
be right within my grasp.

00:02:47.667 --> 00:02:51.212 position:50% align:center
That's why I'm going to Kanto.

00:02:51.296 --> 00:02:52.422 position:50% align:center
It's too dangero--

00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:54.424 position:50% align:center
Like I said, I'm sick
and tired of living

00:02:54.507 --> 00:02:57.677 position:50% align:center
in this boring-ass world.
I'm taking this chance,

00:02:57.761 --> 00:03:00.096 position:50% align:center
even if it costs me
my life, okay?

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.639 position:50% align:center
[ORDINARY]
But as long as there's life,

00:03:01.723 --> 00:03:03.266 position:50% align:center
there's hope, right?

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.143 position:50% align:center
[BROTHER]
Hacker, did you forget?

00:03:05.226 --> 00:03:07.103 position:50% align:center
You're still wearing
your collar bomb.

00:03:07.187 --> 00:03:10.690 position:50% align:center
Your hacking skills will come
in handy if we run into--

00:03:10.774 --> 00:03:13.443 position:50% align:center
I'll admit, it took me a
while to figure this out.

00:03:13.526 --> 00:03:15.737 position:50% align:center
But that's no surprise,
it's Kanto-made.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.113 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR] Kids these days
think they're so clever.

00:03:17.197 --> 00:03:18.907 position:50% align:center
[BRAWLER] What the hell, man?
That ain't fair!

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:20.116 position:50% align:center
Hacker...

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.160 position:50% align:center
If you know the odds of
surviving aren't good,

00:03:22.243 --> 00:03:25.121 position:50% align:center
what's the point of going?

00:03:25.205 --> 00:03:26.581 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:34.005 --> 00:03:38.551 position:50% align:center
[HACKER] A parting gift.
You wanted one, right?

00:03:38.635 --> 00:03:40.762 position:50% align:center
[ORDINARY] But parting gifts are
for the person who's leaving,

00:03:40.845 --> 00:03:44.808 position:50% align:center
not staying. Someday,
I'll return this to you!

00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:46.476 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:05:29.412 --> 00:05:32.248 position:50% align:center
[MASTER]
Finally awake, I see.

00:05:34.751 --> 00:05:35.919 position:50% align:center
[PUPIL]
Master...

00:05:36.002 --> 00:05:38.004 position:50% align:center
You can thank
the recovery crew.

00:05:38.088 --> 00:05:39.839 position:50% align:center
If they'd reached us only
a few minutes later,

00:05:39.923 --> 00:05:42.926 position:50% align:center
we'd be in a coffin instead
of a hospital bed.

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:47.847 position:50% align:center
No. There wouldn't be enough
of us left to even fill a grave.

00:05:47.931 --> 00:05:52.310 position:50% align:center
[PUPIL]
The Akudama! Were they captured?

00:05:52.394 --> 00:05:54.854 position:50% align:center
Please don't tell me
they escaped again!

00:05:54.938 --> 00:05:56.940 position:50% align:center
We last saw them
on the Shinkansen

00:05:57.023 --> 00:05:59.192 position:50% align:center
headed for the
Decontamination Zone.

00:05:59.275 --> 00:06:00.568 position:50% align:center
That's all I know.

00:06:00.652 --> 00:06:03.238 position:50% align:center
What a relief.

00:06:03.321 --> 00:06:07.200 position:50% align:center
They must be dead. No one
could've survived that.

00:06:07.283 --> 00:06:08.868 position:50% align:center
[MASTER grunts]

00:06:08.952 --> 00:06:11.621 position:50% align:center
[POLITICIAN B] The Akudama
are very much alive.

00:06:11.705 --> 00:06:13.289 position:50% align:center
Impossible.

00:06:13.373 --> 00:06:15.834 position:50% align:center
[POLITICIAN B] You've failed
to deal with them yet again.

00:06:15.917 --> 00:06:19.170 position:50% align:center
[BOSS] But how? They entered
the Decontamination Zone!

00:06:19.254 --> 00:06:24.259 position:50% align:center
[POLITICIAN A] Enough excuses.
This is utterly unacceptable.

00:06:24.342 --> 00:06:26.052 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:06:26.136 --> 00:06:28.263 position:50% align:center
[POLITICIAN C] And that
wasn't your only blunder.

00:06:28.346 --> 00:06:30.056 position:50% align:center
Precious cargo that was
meant to be delivered

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:33.810 position:50% align:center
to Kanto was stolen as well.
You're on thin ice.

00:06:33.893 --> 00:06:37.355 position:50% align:center
[BOSS] Yes, sir. I'll handle
the situation at once.

00:06:54.122 --> 00:06:58.877 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.004 position:50% align:center
[BRAWLER] The hell?
We got out of that shithole

00:07:01.087 --> 00:07:03.506 position:50% align:center
only to wind up out here
in the freakin' rain?

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:04.591 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR]
Tell me about it.

00:07:04.674 --> 00:07:06.634 position:50% align:center
My hair is getting all
stiff and gross.

00:07:06.718 --> 00:07:09.429 position:50% align:center
[HOODLUM] Yeah, but it was
pretty awesome how we got

00:07:09.512 --> 00:07:12.223 position:50% align:center
outta there using
that barrier, right?

00:07:14.351 --> 00:07:16.227 position:50% align:center
[HOODLUM] You kids got
any other cool stuff?

00:07:16.311 --> 00:07:18.897 position:50% align:center
Like a bazooka we can blow up
the Executioners with?

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:20.440 position:50% align:center
Or-- Or like, a money tree?

00:07:20.523 --> 00:07:22.692 position:50% align:center
No, we don't have anything
that could be used to kill.

00:07:22.776 --> 00:07:24.527 position:50% align:center
Though that would
sure come in handy.

00:07:24.611 --> 00:07:26.946 position:50% align:center
Sadly, we didn't have too
much time to prepare.

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:28.323 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:07:28.406 --> 00:07:30.742 position:50% align:center
[COURIER] All right, tell us
the destination already.

00:07:30.825 --> 00:07:33.286 position:50% align:center
Not all of us want to sit
around and chat all day.

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:34.704 position:50% align:center
You're always so impatient

00:07:34.788 --> 00:07:37.082 position:50% align:center
when it comes to
work, huh, Courier?

00:07:37.165 --> 00:07:40.168 position:50% align:center
Fine, it makes sense
to disclose that now.

00:07:40.251 --> 00:07:41.753 position:50% align:center
Our destination is--

00:07:41.836 --> 00:07:46.883 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR] Before that. I think
it's time you kids come clean.

00:07:46.966 --> 00:07:49.719 position:50% align:center
How about enlightening us.
Just who the hell are you?

00:07:49.803 --> 00:07:51.262 position:50% align:center
Are you sure that information

00:07:51.346 --> 00:07:53.431 position:50% align:center
is really necessary
to complete the job?

00:07:53.515 --> 00:07:55.016 position:50% align:center
What job?

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:57.268 position:50% align:center
You mean the one that involved
stealing and delivering a vault?

00:07:57.352 --> 00:08:00.146 position:50% align:center
Because I remember
signing on for that.

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:03.525 position:50% align:center
But instead, we're
escorting children.

00:08:03.608 --> 00:08:06.778 position:50% align:center
You can see how that
changes things. Right, kid?

00:08:06.861 --> 00:08:09.656 position:50% align:center
It sounds like we can
easily solve this problem.

00:08:09.739 --> 00:08:12.117 position:50% align:center
If you want more money,
I can double the pay.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:13.326 position:50% align:center
For real?

00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:14.911 position:50% align:center
[BROTHER]
Regardless of the situation,

00:08:14.994 --> 00:08:17.664 position:50% align:center
I'm still your employer,
remember?

00:08:17.747 --> 00:08:19.708 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR]
Listen here, brat.

00:08:19.791 --> 00:08:22.293 position:50% align:center
If you think we took
this gig for the reward,

00:08:22.377 --> 00:08:25.255 position:50% align:center
you're wildly mistaken.

00:08:25.338 --> 00:08:26.840 position:50% align:center
The dreadlocked oaf and Hacker

00:08:26.923 --> 00:08:29.843 position:50% align:center
both made that perfectly clear,
did they not?

00:08:29.926 --> 00:08:32.887 position:50% align:center
You won't keep us hooked
by just flashing cash.

00:08:32.971 --> 00:08:34.681 position:50% align:center
Forget these collar bombs.

00:08:34.764 --> 00:08:37.225 position:50% align:center
They don't mean anything
if we can't trust you.

00:08:37.308 --> 00:08:40.103 position:50% align:center
A smart boy like you
should get that.

00:08:40.186 --> 00:08:43.690 position:50% align:center
So, are you gonna answer?
I said, who the hell are you?

00:08:43.773 --> 00:08:45.316 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:49.821 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR] Excuse me.
I'm mid-conversation!

00:08:49.904 --> 00:08:52.115 position:50% align:center
[ORDINARY]
Stop. That's enough.

00:08:52.198 --> 00:08:54.701 position:50% align:center
I'm sure there's a reason
they can't go into details.

00:08:54.784 --> 00:08:56.119 position:50% align:center
I mean, they were
locked in a vault

00:08:56.202 --> 00:08:58.204 position:50% align:center
on the Shinkansen,
of all places.

00:08:58.288 --> 00:09:00.165 position:50% align:center

how they got there

Somehow or another,
they're involved with Kanto.

This is way beyond stealing
some nondescript vault.

Don't expect Kanto to
stay quiet about it.

If they get wind, you'll be
in deep trouble, too,

The Professor gave you that
lunch box for a reason.

To be completely honest,
we're both fine without eating.

what to ask for.

Uh? Are you just not hungry?

You know about the

00:14:20.318 --> 00:14:22.529 position:50% align:center
[SHARK] I know it's an

Kanto, but that's pretty much
everything I know about it!

00:14:26.199 --> 00:14:28.243 position:50% align:center
[BUNNY] Well, since you've
been living under a rock,

00:14:28.326 --> 00:14:30.036 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna teach you
all about it!

[SHARK]
Lucky me!

00:14:32.622 --> 00:14:34.124 position:50% align:center
[BUNNY]
So Kanto wants a bunch of stuff

00:14:34.207 --> 00:14:35.542 position:50% align:center
and the Kyushu Plant's the one

00:14:35.625 --> 00:14:37.794 position:50% align:center
that researches and
manufacturers it!

00:14:37.877 --> 00:14:39.295 position:50% align:center
[SHARK]
Huh...

00:14:39.379 --> 00:14:41.589 position:50% align:center
[BUNNY] If you check the label
and it says "Kanto-made,"

00:14:41.673 --> 00:14:43.466 position:50% align:center
then that's where it came from.

00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:44.926 position:50% align:center
[SHARK]
That's pretty neat!

00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:48.054 position:50% align:center
Is there anything they can't
build at the Kyushu Plant?

00:14:48.138 --> 00:14:50.432 position:50% align:center
[BUNNY]
Nope! They can make anything!

00:14:50.515 --> 00:14:54.394 position:50% align:center
And I mean anything!

00:14:54.477 --> 00:14:57.313 position:50% align:center
[SHARK] I sure wish I had
some "Kanto-made" brains!

00:14:57.397 --> 00:14:59.524 position:50% align:center
[BUNNY] Trust me,
everyone wishes you did!

You didn't need to
come see us, Boss.

[BOSS]
Aren't you a smart one?

00:15:22.005 --> 00:15:23.798 position:50% align:center
Whatever it is,
I'd appreciate if you

00:15:23.882 --> 00:15:26.051 position:50% align:center
keep it short, we're in
a lot of pain here.

00:15:26.134 --> 00:15:28.720 position:50% align:center
[BOSS] Considering how you're
well enough to joke around,

00:15:28.803 --> 00:15:31.389 position:50% align:center
I won't hold back any punches.

00:15:31.473 --> 00:15:33.725 position:50% align:center
I was lenient and gave
you a second chance,

00:15:33.808 --> 00:15:36.728 position:50% align:center
yet once again you were unable
to stop those Akudama.

00:15:36.811 --> 00:15:39.272 position:50% align:center
Failure of this magnitude
is inexcusable.

00:15:39.356 --> 00:15:41.858 position:50% align:center
But they were stuck on
board the Shinkansen,

00:15:41.941 --> 00:15:43.068 position:50% align:center
shouldn't they be dead?

00:15:43.151 --> 00:15:45.278 position:50% align:center
All the Akudama have survived.

00:15:45.362 --> 00:15:46.696 position:50% align:center
[PUPIL]
Impossible!

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:48.865 position:50% align:center
You mean they escapes the
Absolute Quarantine Zone?

00:15:48.948 --> 00:15:51.451 position:50% align:center
Not only that, but they
stole valuable goods

00:15:51.534 --> 00:15:54.412 position:50% align:center
from the front carriage.
Apparently you weren't enough

00:15:54.496 --> 00:15:56.664 position:50% align:center
to stop them from
completing their objective.

00:15:56.748 --> 00:15:58.958 position:50% align:center
No way.

00:15:59.042 --> 00:16:01.294 position:50% align:center
[BOSS] Unless you sustained
brain damage,

00:16:01.378 --> 00:16:04.798 position:50% align:center
it should be pretty clear
what that means.

00:16:04.881 --> 00:16:07.217 position:50% align:center
[MASTER]
We were utterly defeated.

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:08.802 position:50% align:center
Is that what you're saying?

00:16:08.885 --> 00:16:10.387 position:50% align:center
[BOSS]
That's right.

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:13.890 position:50% align:center
This is the biggest failure our
organization has ever suffered.

00:16:13.973 --> 00:16:17.811 position:50% align:center
Now word's reached Kanto and
they've issued us direct orders.

00:16:17.894 --> 00:16:21.064 position:50% align:center
We're doing a full-scale
search-and-destroy mission.

00:16:21.147 --> 00:16:24.359 position:50% align:center
Boss! Please just give us one
more shot! I swear, we'll--

00:16:24.442 --> 00:16:28.279 position:50% align:center
Shut your mouth!
Suspension, both of you.

00:16:28.363 --> 00:16:32.617 position:50% align:center
Be grateful you're alive,
despite your incompetence.

00:16:36.871 --> 00:16:39.708 position:50% align:center
Master, let's get back out there
and deal with them on our own!

00:16:39.791 --> 00:16:41.292 position:50% align:center
We can't let it end
like this, can we?

00:16:41.376 --> 00:16:43.670 position:50% align:center
She just told us that
we're suspended.

00:16:43.753 --> 00:16:45.213 position:50% align:center
Orders are orders.

00:16:45.296 --> 00:16:47.882 position:50% align:center
Yeah, and our original orders
were to kill those Akudama!

00:16:47.966 --> 00:16:50.301 position:50% align:center
Shouldn't we take responsibility
and obey them, too?

00:16:50.385 --> 00:16:52.804 position:50% align:center
Apparently, you're still
not thinking straight.

00:16:52.887 --> 00:16:56.099 position:50% align:center
Look. We screwed up twice.
End of story.

00:16:56.182 --> 00:16:59.394 position:50% align:center
Be thankful. We got off
easy with a suspension.

00:16:59.477 --> 00:17:00.812 position:50% align:center
Could've been worse.

00:17:00.895 --> 00:17:06.776 position:50% align:center
Thankful...? Master,
you're okay with this?

00:17:11.114 --> 00:17:13.950 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR] Well, sounds like
we're returning to Kansai.

00:17:14.034 --> 00:17:15.076 position:50% align:center
So what's the plan?

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:16.828 position:50% align:center
Storm in, kick ass,
and have fun!

00:17:16.911 --> 00:17:18.830 position:50% align:center
Eat your meat before
it rots, big boy.

00:17:18.913 --> 00:17:20.248 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah.

00:17:20.331 --> 00:17:22.709 position:50% align:center
So then, the Executioners
have probably figured out

00:17:22.792 --> 00:17:26.338 position:50% align:center
by now that we're alive. Which
means, they're likely setting up

00:17:26.421 --> 00:17:28.840 position:50% align:center
some kind of trap to
catch us as we speak.

00:17:28.923 --> 00:17:31.468 position:50% align:center
We won't give them the chance.
I know of a drainage pipe

00:17:31.551 --> 00:17:34.304 position:50% align:center
that connects to Kansai's moat,
we can sneak in through there.

00:17:34.387 --> 00:17:35.722 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR]
Hm. From the north side?

00:17:35.805 --> 00:17:38.224 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it's also a shortcut
to the coordinates.

00:17:38.308 --> 00:17:42.854 position:50% align:center
I'll get them to their
destination. No matter what.

00:17:42.937 --> 00:17:44.147 position:50% align:center
We head out in four hours.

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:45.732 position:50% align:center
So not like, right now?

00:17:45.815 --> 00:17:48.193 position:50% align:center
[HOODLUM] Woo-hoo!
I'm down for takin' a nap!

00:17:48.276 --> 00:17:49.527 position:50% align:center
Why not?

00:17:49.611 --> 00:17:53.031 position:50% align:center
At least I can kill a buncha
people in my dreams.

00:17:53.114 --> 00:17:53.990 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR]
A word.

00:17:54.074 --> 00:17:56.743 position:50% align:center
Yeah? What can I help you with?

00:17:56.826 --> 00:17:58.244 position:50% align:center
Thanks to your
speech back there,

00:17:58.328 --> 00:18:02.415 position:50% align:center
I've seen how you
win people over.

00:18:02.499 --> 00:18:04.209 position:50% align:center
But I wouldn't let
your guard down.

00:18:04.292 --> 00:18:07.587 position:50% align:center
That little innocent act of
yours isn't charming me.

00:18:07.671 --> 00:18:10.006 position:50% align:center
That's not what I...

00:18:18.264 --> 00:18:21.810 position:50% align:center
[BRAWLER snoring]

00:18:21.893 --> 00:18:24.145 position:50% align:center
[HOODLUM]
Help me!

00:18:33.196 --> 00:18:34.364 position:50% align:center
[ORDINARY sighs]

00:18:34.447 --> 00:18:36.157 position:50% align:center
[COURIER] Plan on
tagging along for a while?

00:18:36.241 --> 00:18:41.663 position:50% align:center
[ORDINARY gasps]
This again? "For a while," huh?

00:18:41.746 --> 00:18:43.206 position:50% align:center
Well, I know for
sure that I want

00:18:43.289 --> 00:18:45.500 position:50% align:center
to take them all the way
to Expo Park, at least.

00:18:45.583 --> 00:18:47.210 position:50% align:center
I can't let a couple
of little kids

00:18:47.293 --> 00:18:48.962 position:50% align:center
just truck it on their own.

00:18:49.045 --> 00:18:53.049 position:50% align:center
And plus, it's not like I have
much of a choice, right?

00:18:58.346 --> 00:19:01.433 position:50% align:center
Hey, uh, weird question,
but is there anything

00:19:01.516 --> 00:19:03.393 position:50% align:center
that you value more
than your own life?

00:19:03.476 --> 00:19:04.894 position:50% align:center
What does that mean?

00:19:04.978 --> 00:19:08.106 position:50% align:center
Like for example: If the only
way to complete this job

00:19:08.189 --> 00:19:10.567 position:50% align:center
was by sacrificing yourself,
would you go through with it,

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:12.235 position:50% align:center
or run away and keep on living?

00:19:12.318 --> 00:19:14.612 position:50% align:center
Y'know, collar bombs
notwithstanding, of course.

00:19:14.696 --> 00:19:18.408 position:50% align:center
Well that's a shitty question.
Especially because I never fail.

00:19:18.491 --> 00:19:20.493 position:50% align:center
C'mon, penny for your thoughts.

00:19:20.577 --> 00:19:24.164 position:50% align:center
Oh. That reminds me. Here.

00:19:24.247 --> 00:19:26.499 position:50% align:center
About time I returned
the 500 yen you dropped

00:19:26.583 --> 00:19:29.044 position:50% align:center
getting takoyaki.
It's had quite the trip.

00:19:29.127 --> 00:19:31.379 position:50% align:center
Nope. Taking dropped
change is bad luck.

00:19:31.463 --> 00:19:33.214 position:50% align:center
Oh, come on, just take it!

00:19:33.298 --> 00:19:37.427 position:50% align:center
This coin got me into this whole
mess, I don't want it anywa--

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:38.970 position:50% align:center
Nothing. Heh! Just take it.

00:19:39.054 --> 00:19:41.348 position:50% align:center
No. The only time
I take money is

00:19:41.431 --> 00:19:42.932 position:50% align:center
when I'm accepting a job.

00:19:43.016 --> 00:19:45.393 position:50% align:center
[ORDINARY]
So stubborn! Hold out your hand!

00:19:45.477 --> 00:19:46.394 position:50% align:center
[COURIER]
No.

00:19:46.478 --> 00:19:47.896 position:50% align:center
[ORDINARY]
Then open up a pocket!

00:19:47.979 --> 00:19:50.065 position:50% align:center
Hey! Don't you walk
away from me!

00:19:50.148 --> 00:19:52.901 position:50% align:center
Let me pay you back already!

00:19:56.488 --> 00:19:58.823 position:50% align:center
Attention, all Executioners!

00:20:00.992 --> 00:20:03.787 position:50% align:center
As of now, I'm issuing a
search-and-destroy order

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:06.373 position:50% align:center
for seven Super S-Rank Akudama!

00:20:06.456 --> 00:20:09.542 position:50% align:center
Not only did these criminals
attack the Shinkansen,

00:20:09.626 --> 00:20:12.504 position:50% align:center
they managed to steal
goods bound for Kanto!

00:20:12.587 --> 00:20:15.465 position:50% align:center
This is a disgrace
to all Executioners!

00:20:15.548 --> 00:20:17.592 position:50% align:center
We must never
forget our mission!

00:20:17.676 --> 00:20:21.680 position:50% align:center
To Exterminate all Akudama
scum from our world.

00:20:21.763 --> 00:20:24.432 position:50% align:center
So do we let them
do as they please?

00:20:24.516 --> 00:20:26.893 position:50% align:center
No! We take action!

00:20:26.976 --> 00:20:30.355 position:50% align:center
Executioners must be considered
the ultimate threat!

00:20:30.438 --> 00:20:34.693 position:50% align:center
Executioners must be seen as
the enforcers of justice!

00:20:34.776 --> 00:20:38.780 position:50% align:center
We won't rest until we
cut down every last Akudama!

00:20:38.863 --> 00:20:42.158 position:50% align:center
Each of them will meet
their end by our hands!

00:20:42.242 --> 00:20:46.955 position:50% align:center
And then we'll display their
severed heads to set an example.

00:20:47.038 --> 00:20:52.043 position:50% align:center
That is our very purpose
as Executioners!

00:20:52.127 --> 00:20:55.755 position:50% align:center
An order to all
Executioners? Damn it!

00:20:55.839 --> 00:20:58.174 position:50% align:center
I can't stand being
stuck in this room!

00:20:58.258 --> 00:21:02.303 position:50% align:center
We can't stay here,
doing absolutely nothing!

00:21:02.387 --> 00:21:05.432 position:50% align:center
Master? Are you sleeping?

00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:10.145 position:50% align:center
[PUPIL]
Um. I'm coming in.

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:35.128 position:50% align:center
[ORDINARY]
Hey, Courier.

00:21:35.211 --> 00:21:37.088 position:50% align:center
Is this the entrance you
were telling us about?

00:21:37.172 --> 00:21:40.508 position:50% align:center
[COURIER] Yeah. Should lead us
all the way to Takatsuki.

00:21:40.592 --> 00:21:44.971 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR] One of Courier's
secret routes, huh?

00:21:45.055 --> 00:21:47.098 position:50% align:center
[ORDINARY] Not the most
pleasant smelling one.

00:21:47.182 --> 00:21:49.517 position:50% align:center
[HOODLUM] Welcome to
toilet bowl of Kansai.

00:21:49.601 --> 00:21:51.269 position:50% align:center
[BRAWLER]
Huh. Kinda smells like meat.

00:21:51.353 --> 00:21:53.021 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR]
I should make some deodorizer.

00:21:53.104 --> 00:21:58.151 position:50% align:center
The kids can ride with me on
my bike. The rest of you are--

00:21:58.234 --> 00:22:01.529 position:50% align:center
[MASTER] You didn't think you
got away from me, did you?

00:23:43.673 --> 00:23:46.926 position:50% align:center
[BOSS] He made his decision.
He's prepared to die.
