34
00:03:14,265 --> 00:03:14,855
Oh.

215
00:12:00,539 --> 00:12:00,949
Oh.

321
00:17:29,219 --> 00:17:29,878
Oh.

363
00:19:12,924 --> 00:19:13,780
No.

15
00:02:30,297 --> 00:02:30,938
Yes?

24
00:02:47,922 --> 00:02:48,479
Yes.

50
00:04:28,797 --> 00:04:29,220
Huh?

68
00:05:25,286 --> 00:05:25,732
Hmm?

152
00:09:12,406 --> 00:09:12,838
Yep!

206
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:37,291
Huh?

287
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:21,886
Huh?

400
00:20:46,648 --> 00:20:47,325
Yes.

443
00:22:55,189 --> 00:22:55,779
Yes.

461
00:23:51,373 --> 00:23:51,897
Hey.

18
00:02:34,922 --> 00:02:35,559
Yeah.

41
00:03:53,422 --> 00:03:54,015
Oh...

99
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:12,201
What?

147
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:02,527
Sure.

161
00:09:34,192 --> 00:09:34,790
Yeah!

173
00:10:12,309 --> 00:10:13,122
Kaho!

232
00:12:54,172 --> 00:12:54,735
'Kay?

251
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:53,033
True.

254
00:13:57,089 --> 00:13:57,634
Yeah?

355
00:18:55,627 --> 00:18:56,627
Whoa!

365
00:19:16,567 --> 00:19:17,244
Yeah.

456
00:23:35,589 --> 00:23:36,258
Yeah!

221
00:12:27,753 --> 00:12:28,625
Sorry.

301
00:16:17,593 --> 00:16:18,433
Right.

367
00:19:20,714 --> 00:19:21,424
Haori?

369
00:19:24,356 --> 00:19:25,039
Right.

384
00:20:10,797 --> 00:20:11,693
Oreki?

156
00:09:22,881 --> 00:09:23,817
Uh-huh.

267
00:14:31,222 --> 00:14:32,035
Mm-hmm.

325
00:17:42,547 --> 00:17:43,933
Mayaka!

330
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:53,244
Mm-hmm.

333
00:17:59,617 --> 00:18:00,468
Really?

348
00:18:38,172 --> 00:18:38,917
Thanks.

359
00:19:02,922 --> 00:19:03,667
Mayaka.

428
00:22:11,718 --> 00:22:12,654
String?

157
00:09:25,874 --> 00:09:26,571
...Here.

195
00:11:10,864 --> 00:11:11,684
Me, too.

310
00:16:42,506 --> 00:16:43,226
Perfect.

186
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:48,985
So sorry.

319
00:17:25,006 --> 00:17:25,780
Chitanda?

8
00:00:31,142 --> 00:00:31,954
Oh, right.

35
00:03:22,711 --> 00:03:23,919
It's cold.

48
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:16,484
Huh? Yeah.

158
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:27,536
...Thanks.

162
00:09:36,339 --> 00:09:37,482
Number 16.

187
00:10:49,172 --> 00:10:49,987
It's fine!

313
00:16:52,322 --> 00:16:53,244
Oh. Right!

326
00:17:44,488 --> 00:17:45,743
Fuku, hey.

391
00:20:26,506 --> 00:20:27,274
Too short.

464
00:25:36,589 --> 00:25:37,317
Next time:

53
00:04:34,809 --> 00:04:35,559
What is it?

74
00:05:53,006 --> 00:05:53,839
Hello, sir.

104
00:07:23,006 --> 00:07:23,871
Yeah, I am.

200
00:11:25,076 --> 00:11:26,216
Hey, Oreki.

228
00:12:44,756 --> 00:12:45,638
Ah... Ah...

252
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:55,273
Oh my gosh!

430
00:22:19,817 --> 00:22:20,456
This is...!

63
00:05:15,746 --> 00:05:16,692
Hermit crab?

114
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:54,389
Hey, Mayaka!

118
00:08:02,334 --> 00:08:03,407
Don't stare.

153
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:13,878
Here you go.

246
00:13:39,741 --> 00:13:40,648
I hear that.

315
00:17:17,422 --> 00:17:19,130
Ah. Jumonji.

353
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:52,742
What's that?

376
00:19:45,065 --> 00:19:45,962
That's okay.

169
00:10:04,214 --> 00:10:05,089
I'm so sorry.

336
00:18:05,806 --> 00:18:06,733
Sure doesn't.

420
00:21:51,051 --> 00:21:51,925
What the...?!

1
00:00:11,547 --> 00:00:12,658
Hey, Chitanda.

61
00:04:55,349 --> 00:04:56,682
What did I do?

137
00:08:39,089 --> 00:08:40,145
Just fortunes.

207
00:11:37,672 --> 00:11:38,483
This isn't it.

217
00:12:02,631 --> 00:12:03,685
I'll fix that!

227
00:12:43,531 --> 00:12:44,691
Hold on! Wait!

275
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,102
This is awful.

39
00:03:50,259 --> 00:03:51,467
Happy New Year.

73
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,760
May I help you?

86
00:06:37,545 --> 00:06:38,712
Happy New Year.

89
00:06:44,158 --> 00:06:45,200
Happy New Year.

119
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:05,743
Happy New Year.

121
00:08:07,881 --> 00:08:09,089
Happy New Year!

257
00:14:03,271 --> 00:14:04,101
Go ahead, then.

9
00:00:32,374 --> 00:00:33,664
Anyway, Oreki...

21
00:02:41,422 --> 00:02:42,703
No plans so far.

65
00:05:18,549 --> 00:05:19,432
Where's Satoshi?

130
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:27,798
Where is Fukube?

154
00:09:19,006 --> 00:09:20,187
I got number 10!

159
00:09:30,301 --> 00:09:32,271
Wow! Great luck!

260
00:14:09,996 --> 00:14:11,124
That's terrible!

305
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:31,793
That might work!

457
00:23:38,579 --> 00:23:39,746
You've saved us.

23
00:02:46,589 --> 00:02:47,839
Visit the shrine?

38
00:03:39,797 --> 00:03:41,471
Ah! Hello, Oreki!

49
00:04:27,262 --> 00:04:28,315
Can I carry that?

54
00:04:35,587 --> 00:04:36,727
A bottle of saké.

189
00:10:52,172 --> 00:10:53,420
The storehouse...

202
00:11:29,371 --> 00:11:30,662
Yeah, I think so.

210
00:11:47,033 --> 00:11:48,283
I can't say that.

238
00:13:10,797 --> 00:13:11,808
What do you mean?

259
00:14:07,006 --> 00:14:08,223
I don't have one.

291
00:15:49,119 --> 00:15:50,286
You can see that?

334
00:18:01,131 --> 00:18:02,787
Oh, that's right.

399
00:20:45,144 --> 00:20:46,356
Is that a string?

415
00:21:28,951 --> 00:21:30,285
Sorry 'bout this.

3
00:00:18,297 --> 00:00:20,006
Well, yeah. Maybe.

19
00:02:35,882 --> 00:02:36,862
I was wondering...

134
00:08:33,881 --> 00:08:34,903
I think that's it.

296
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:01,167
The shrine office.

422
00:21:57,006 --> 00:21:58,146
She had it before!

17
00:02:33,422 --> 00:02:34,519
Is that you, Oreki?

85
00:06:34,797 --> 00:06:36,100
Very distinguished.

95
00:07:00,103 --> 00:07:01,270
I accept this gift.

124
00:08:13,631 --> 00:08:14,689
Is it long-sleeved?

166
00:09:52,464 --> 00:09:54,492
If you say so, sir.

181
00:10:31,814 --> 00:10:32,817
I want to help you.

205
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:36,696
No, the storehouse.

230
00:12:49,964 --> 00:12:51,511
Ah! I'm very sorry.

411
00:21:11,172 --> 00:21:13,589
Back to square one.

417
00:21:39,964 --> 00:21:41,631
Bingo! I was right!

429
00:22:12,714 --> 00:22:13,881
Yeah, check it out.

434
00:22:27,214 --> 00:22:28,124
I'll be right back!

52
00:04:33,131 --> 00:04:34,195
Thanks for offering.

113
00:07:47,464 --> 00:07:48,604
You can go on ahead.

160
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:34,124
That's awesome, Chi!

170
00:10:05,172 --> 00:10:06,464
No, I'm not excited,

175
00:10:17,506 --> 00:10:18,820
No, never mind that.

191
00:10:56,569 --> 00:10:58,486
Whew, it's freezing.

357
00:18:59,674 --> 00:19:00,799
But this is strange.

372
00:19:35,533 --> 00:19:36,783
I'm sorry, Chitanda.

380
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:56,446
Let's call for help.

407
00:21:03,525 --> 00:21:05,256
Um, no, not exactly.

30
00:03:01,839 --> 00:03:03,381
And I was thinking...

57
00:04:44,547 --> 00:04:45,634
Sounds like a hassle.

82
00:06:07,547 --> 00:06:08,977
I'll go and get Kaho.

111
00:07:42,881 --> 00:07:45,300
Ibara? Oh, that girl.

115
00:07:55,089 --> 00:07:56,797
Oh. Chi, you made it!

151
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:12,291
You're so darn happy.

172
00:10:09,924 --> 00:10:11,614
Fine, gimme my curse.

218
00:12:03,725 --> 00:12:04,934
Please say he didn't!

220
00:12:14,226 --> 00:12:15,643
We're locked in here.

269
00:14:34,486 --> 00:14:35,828
So go ahead and yell.

314
00:17:09,052 --> 00:17:10,408
Please let this work.

316
00:17:19,256 --> 00:17:20,490
Happy New Year to ya!

364
00:19:15,013 --> 00:19:16,388
Are you feeling okay?

416
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:39,833
Oreki... What are...?

107
00:07:27,988 --> 00:07:29,466
Divine psychic powers?

198
00:11:18,317 --> 00:11:20,162
Yeah. That's possible.

329
00:17:51,076 --> 00:17:52,100
You're a real trooper.

347
00:18:36,467 --> 00:18:38,009
Here, found this, too.

387
00:20:16,547 --> 00:20:17,797
Yeah, about this much?

13
00:00:46,113 --> 00:00:47,439
That's a good question.

106
00:07:26,701 --> 00:07:27,915
How does she know that?

145
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:00,006
I'll take one of those.

164
00:09:46,214 --> 00:09:48,057
Uh, nah, but it's fine.

193
00:11:02,616 --> 00:11:03,991
That's not very secure.

219
00:12:09,405 --> 00:12:10,797
Hey, what's the matter?

123
00:08:11,922 --> 00:08:13,547
Thank you for saying so!

263
00:14:19,551 --> 00:14:21,342
You know... Forget this.

349
00:18:42,571 --> 00:18:44,306
Hey, Fuku, look at this!

408
00:21:05,339 --> 00:21:06,714
The sash would fall off.

67
00:05:23,443 --> 00:05:25,063
Oh, you know what, Oreki?

142
00:08:53,797 --> 00:08:55,381
Lost children everywhere.

146
00:09:00,089 --> 00:09:01,414
Okay, pick one out, then!

265
00:14:25,172 --> 00:14:26,496
I thought we had options.

362
00:19:10,754 --> 00:19:12,390
Help isn't coming, is it?

386
00:20:14,857 --> 00:20:16,437
Um... Did you say string?

455
00:23:33,573 --> 00:23:35,321
Hotaro! Are you in there?

460
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:46,146
I'm opening the door now.

40
00:03:51,591 --> 00:03:53,150
I hope it brings you luck.

72
00:05:47,924 --> 00:05:50,028
Excuse us, is anyone here?

87
00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:40,421
I hope it brings you luck.

109
00:07:35,047 --> 00:07:36,679
You mean we're classmates?

247
00:13:40,857 --> 00:13:42,211
What do you propose we do?

278
00:15:00,364 --> 00:15:01,915
What? There are that many?

390
00:20:25,297 --> 00:20:26,422
The strap from my sandals?

397
00:20:39,964 --> 00:20:41,464
then I might have an idea.

7
00:00:29,081 --> 00:00:30,358
How could that ever happen?

36
00:03:34,012 --> 00:03:35,482
It's New Year's, all right.

128
00:08:21,714 --> 00:08:23,172
What are you guys gonna do?

214
00:11:58,975 --> 00:12:00,392
Then let's head over there.

216
00:12:01,135 --> 00:12:02,539
Someone left this unlocked.

293
00:15:52,606 --> 00:15:54,106
What is she, a wild animal?

354
00:18:53,036 --> 00:18:54,713
That's the fortune he drew.

396
00:20:38,506 --> 00:20:39,881
If there's no other choice,

79
00:06:01,622 --> 00:06:03,288
Hotaro Oreki, tagging along.

125
00:08:14,714 --> 00:08:16,197
No, it's the normal pattern.

148
00:09:03,006 --> 00:09:05,062
Whoa, that purse is amazing!

188
00:10:50,089 --> 00:10:51,408
I'll tag along and help you.

234
00:12:58,624 --> 00:13:00,064
What will happen after that?

244
00:13:30,589 --> 00:13:32,366
It would be a major scandal!

294
00:15:54,182 --> 00:15:56,057
Oh, good, he's walking away.

307
00:16:36,297 --> 00:16:37,547
Let's just hope she gets it.

311
00:16:43,464 --> 00:16:44,577
That's what we'll use, then.

409
00:21:06,797 --> 00:21:08,633
What?! That's not an option!

451
00:23:18,714 --> 00:23:19,987
but that's beside the point.

70
00:05:37,389 --> 00:05:39,501
Okay, I wanna get this right.

75
00:05:53,922 --> 00:05:55,565
A very Happy New Year to you.

77
00:05:58,331 --> 00:05:59,772
I've come to pay my respects.

92
00:06:50,733 --> 00:06:52,442
I do hope you will accept it.

150
00:09:07,793 --> 00:09:09,405
Thanks, I'm glad you like it!

253
00:13:55,339 --> 00:13:57,006
I just had the greatest idea!

286
00:15:19,506 --> 00:15:20,997
Yeah, you're right. Silly me.

26
00:02:51,006 --> 00:02:52,499
She's working as an attendant.

94
00:06:58,239 --> 00:07:00,022
Thank you for your generosity.

180
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:31,411
No, it missed her, thankfully.

272
00:14:41,467 --> 00:14:43,141
if they were to misunderstand.

308
00:16:37,672 --> 00:16:39,261
We could drop my handkerchief.

340
00:18:16,631 --> 00:18:18,401
Oh, yeah. You're right, I can!

341
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,730
We're done. Help isn't coming.

346
00:18:34,841 --> 00:18:36,217
My wallet should do the trick.

373
00:19:36,863 --> 00:19:38,347
We can't hold out much longer.

431
00:22:20,612 --> 00:22:22,470
Whoa. What's the matter, Fuku?

439
00:22:45,674 --> 00:22:47,507
"Like a rat trapped in a bag?"

27
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:55,198
That's not really up her alley.

47
00:04:13,269 --> 00:04:15,079
Well, then. Shall we go in now?

78
00:05:59,797 --> 00:06:01,510
I'm his daughter, Eru Chitanda.

90
00:06:45,283 --> 00:06:47,031
May it bring you luck, as well.

120
00:08:05,882 --> 00:08:07,569
I hope that it brings you luck.

131
00:08:28,047 --> 00:08:29,731
He was here earlier in the day.

155
00:09:20,631 --> 00:09:22,475
Here, Oreki, do you wanna play?

204
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:35,124
Is this really the right place?

317
00:17:20,788 --> 00:17:22,507
Happy New Year to you, as well.

383
00:20:06,174 --> 00:20:07,991
Yes, that's it! Satoshi's here!

445
00:22:59,214 --> 00:23:00,927
The withdrawal from Kanegazaki?

462
00:23:52,708 --> 00:23:55,303
Mis-Happy New Year, my friends.

12
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,556
How did we end up in this state?

44
00:03:58,339 --> 00:04:00,030
May it grow throughout the year.

141
00:08:51,825 --> 00:08:53,682
It was way busier earlier today.

283
00:15:12,749 --> 00:15:14,920
No way! We can't do any of that!

436
00:22:35,836 --> 00:22:37,544
Your purse is just a bag, right?

64
00:05:16,755 --> 00:05:18,479
Never mind, it was a stupid joke.

83
00:06:09,128 --> 00:06:10,928
Thanks, and pardon the intrusion.

117
00:07:59,297 --> 00:08:00,991
That's 'cause they did it for me!

143
00:08:55,464 --> 00:08:56,925
Don't remember asking, but great.

176
00:10:18,922 --> 00:10:20,472
Did something happen around here?

235
00:13:01,764 --> 00:13:04,047
Well, I imagine they'd rush over,

279
00:15:02,256 --> 00:15:04,623
Yeah. One, we kick the door down.

350
00:18:44,882 --> 00:18:46,633
That's Hotaro's wallet, isn't it?

401
00:20:47,434 --> 00:20:49,097
Would taking it off be difficult?

432
00:22:22,495 --> 00:22:24,198
Mayaka, quick! Where is the shed?

51
00:04:31,589 --> 00:04:33,106
Yes, that would be really helpful.

163
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:45,777
Did you get a good one too, Oreki?

201
00:11:26,547 --> 00:11:28,806
This place... It is a shed, right?

229
00:12:46,942 --> 00:12:48,703
Please don't draw attention to us!

284
00:15:15,006 --> 00:15:16,437
To you it may just be an old shed,

403
00:20:52,006 --> 00:20:53,918
But I think I'd be able to manage.

28
00:02:55,297 --> 00:02:57,083
That's not very nice of you, Oreki.

98
00:07:09,477 --> 00:07:11,589
We don't want it if it isn't fancy.

211
00:11:49,382 --> 00:11:51,044
When did you plan on mentioning it?

280
00:15:04,766 --> 00:15:06,839
Two, we tear down one of the walls.

410
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:10,773
No, you're right, I guess it's not.

463
00:23:56,511 --> 00:23:58,679
Mis-Happy New Year yourself, buddy.

80
00:06:03,381 --> 00:06:05,266
Oh, so you're Tetsugo's little girl?

101
00:07:15,118 --> 00:07:17,087
Though it really is nothing special.

179
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,576
Oh, that's terrible. Was she burned?

208
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,658
Kaho said to look in the storehouse.

261
00:14:11,246 --> 00:14:12,879
How are we going to get out of here?

374
00:19:38,839 --> 00:19:41,016
It has to have reached Ibara by now,

402
00:20:49,616 --> 00:20:51,870
It would be kind of hard, I suppose.

16
00:02:31,128 --> 00:02:33,339
Hello, this is Eru Chitanda speaking.

96
00:07:01,357 --> 00:07:03,566
Well, uh... It's nothing super fancy.

144
00:08:57,006 --> 00:08:58,736
A new year's fortune sounds like fun.

231
00:12:51,997 --> 00:12:53,917
It's just... You can't yell for help.

404
00:20:54,422 --> 00:20:56,422
Sorry, Chitanda, this may be awkward.

84
00:06:32,339 --> 00:06:34,750
So this is a genuine shrine priestess?

103
00:07:20,964 --> 00:07:22,784
You're in class 1-B, isn't that right?

192
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,559
Let's hurry up and get this over with.

271
00:14:39,599 --> 00:14:41,266
But you wouldn't be too happy about it

318
00:17:22,658 --> 00:17:24,866
Hey, have you seen Eru, by any chance?

356
00:18:56,818 --> 00:18:59,401
Hotaro drew bad luck and it came true.

388
00:20:17,881 --> 00:20:19,756
Fifty centimeters is more than enough.

398
00:20:41,547 --> 00:20:43,775
We could use the <i>obijime</i> from my sash.

440
00:22:47,662 --> 00:22:49,620
I'm not making anything up, I promise.

465
00:25:37,401 --> 00:25:39,204
"The Case of the Homemade Chocolates."

31
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,259
Thinking what? Is there something else?

43
00:03:56,134 --> 00:03:58,275
I'm excited to continue our friendship.

81
00:06:05,547 --> 00:06:07,464
Please, come in. Make yourself at home.

122
00:08:09,124 --> 00:08:11,781
Look at your kimono! It's so beautiful!

132
00:08:29,756 --> 00:08:31,689
He went home to watch some drama on TV.

292
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,434
Really well. I have great night vision.

331
00:17:53,642 --> 00:17:55,714
But enough about me, how was your show?

395
00:20:34,506 --> 00:20:36,538
Sadly, I'm wearing boots with no laces.

447
00:23:04,214 --> 00:23:06,242
his brother-in-law, Azai, betrayed him.

42
00:03:54,105 --> 00:03:55,987
Happy New Year and luck to you, as well.

223
00:12:31,521 --> 00:12:34,317
No. It's just as much my fault as yours.

288
00:15:28,757 --> 00:15:30,618
It looks like someone's coming this way!

324
00:17:37,033 --> 00:17:39,616
I always feel so awkward around Jumonji.

361
00:19:06,464 --> 00:19:08,610
Seems like yours might be the real deal.

20
00:02:36,987 --> 00:02:38,911
Do you have any plans for New Years' Day?

46
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:07,330
I wanted to show off this outfit tonight!

93
00:06:55,387 --> 00:06:57,678
So this must be how the other half lives.

282
00:15:10,256 --> 00:15:12,401
Four, we bust a hole through the ceiling.

371
00:19:29,017 --> 00:19:31,364
It feels like it's getting chillier, too.

105
00:07:23,976 --> 00:07:26,509
I thought Fukube was coming with you guys.

116
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:58,941
That hairstyle looks really pretty on you!

149
00:09:05,507 --> 00:09:07,757
I've never seen one so fancy in real life!

168
00:10:00,995 --> 00:10:03,302
You're really that excited by my bad luck?

245
00:13:36,948 --> 00:13:39,011
I guess I just don't understand her world.

360
00:19:04,256 --> 00:19:06,273
I want to draw one of those fortunes, too.

393
00:20:29,357 --> 00:20:31,231
Can't use that. We need your purse intact.

458
00:23:39,931 --> 00:23:41,828
We were on the verge of freezing to death.

69
00:05:26,272 --> 00:05:28,601
Why don't we start by offering our prayers?

171
00:10:06,547 --> 00:10:08,522
and I can understand if it's bothering you.

225
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:41,172
All right. Well... I'm gonna yell for help.

328
00:17:48,888 --> 00:17:50,930
It must be pretty hard to work in the cold.

343
00:18:26,677 --> 00:18:28,846
but it seems that alone isn't gonna cut it.

345
00:18:32,273 --> 00:18:34,693
All right! Now it's time to execute plan B.

351
00:18:47,068 --> 00:18:49,342
Looks like that moron must have dropped it.

368
00:19:21,816 --> 00:19:23,847
It's a coat that you wear over your kimono.

378
00:19:49,385 --> 00:19:51,673
It isn't selfish. It's your responsibility.

419
00:21:46,172 --> 00:21:48,429
Okay, but what are you going to do with it?

435
00:22:29,922 --> 00:22:33,043
Hotaro, Chitanda! Don't worry, here I come!

452
00:23:20,781 --> 00:23:23,110
I don't think I've heard that story before.

135
00:08:34,935 --> 00:08:36,714
He should be back in a little while, though.

358
00:19:00,824 --> 00:19:02,897
Except for that fortune, his wallet's empty.

382
00:20:01,481 --> 00:20:03,588
Fukube should have made it back by now, too.

392
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:29,293
Oh, what about the drawstring from my purse?

394
00:20:32,381 --> 00:20:34,410
Then why don't we use one of your shoelaces?

412
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:15,256
Well, is there any other string around here?

427
00:22:09,422 --> 00:22:11,630
and why's this old string tied to the purse?

298
00:16:08,556 --> 00:16:10,544
Ibara mentioned earlier that any time someone

459
00:23:42,172 --> 00:23:44,361
They're serving hot sweet saké at the office.

108
00:07:31,256 --> 00:07:34,661
This is Kaho Jumonji. She's also in class 1-B.

133
00:08:31,714 --> 00:08:33,822
What was it called? <i>Dark Clouds: Odani Castle</i>?

174
00:10:14,402 --> 00:10:17,481
Oh, I'm sorry, Eru. I forgot to offer you tea.

212
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:54,238
Sorry about that, Oreki, it just dawned on me.

222
00:12:28,918 --> 00:12:31,309
This is all because I made one stupid mistake.

241
00:13:22,147 --> 00:13:24,971
I am only here tonight to represent my father.

423
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:01,371
So, a handkerchief, a wallet, and now a purse?

426
00:22:07,237 --> 00:22:09,362
What in the world is going on with those guys,

97
00:07:05,756 --> 00:07:08,500
Please, Oreki. It's not your place to say that.

203
00:11:30,786 --> 00:11:33,160
You could call it a shed or maybe even a shack.

256
00:14:01,172 --> 00:14:03,172
I can't believe we didn't think of that before.

289
00:15:43,374 --> 00:15:45,666
It's a parishioner volunteer making his rounds.

295
00:15:56,169 --> 00:15:58,289
He's going to drop it off at the shrine office.

60
00:04:52,817 --> 00:04:55,183
What were you up to today? Anything interesting?

194
00:11:08,492 --> 00:11:10,740
I really hope there's a light in here, at least.

224
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:36,692
And anyway, it's not our fault we got locked in.

242
00:13:25,339 --> 00:13:27,589
If it were another night, it might be different,

268
00:14:32,186 --> 00:14:34,422
But desperate times call for desperate measures.

45
00:04:00,089 --> 00:04:02,811
Oh, yes, may it continue to flourish and prosper.

58
00:04:45,826 --> 00:04:48,397
The real hassle was running around all day today.

136
00:08:36,797 --> 00:08:38,993
So Ibara, what do they have you selling in there?

190
00:10:53,809 --> 00:10:56,272
I think I remember seeing it by the Inari statue.

239
00:13:12,924 --> 00:13:15,907
All of those parishioners... They know my family.

335
00:18:03,065 --> 00:18:05,702
Look, Fuku, does this handkerchief look familiar?

381
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:59,093
I can manage whatever gossip might arise from it.

405
00:20:56,506 --> 00:20:59,059
I don't know much about kimonos, so bear with me.

25
00:02:48,607 --> 00:02:50,922
Mayaka said she got a job there over the holidays.

300
00:16:14,342 --> 00:16:17,138
Well, right now, Ibara is in charge of lost items.

320
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,313
I just got here, so I haven't run into anyone yet.

323
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:35,854
The stove is on in the great hall, if you're cold.

414
00:21:20,283 --> 00:21:22,894
I think I remember seeing a flag outside the shed.

421
00:21:54,051 --> 00:21:56,844
This is definitely Chi's purse, no doubt about it!

449
00:23:11,717 --> 00:23:14,242
to send the message that she was a "rat in a bag."

112
00:07:45,358 --> 00:07:47,439
This will take you right to the back of the kiosks.

127
00:08:19,714 --> 00:08:21,665
I'll be getting out of here in about an hour or so.

165
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,044
I still think it's going to be a really great year.

197
00:11:15,594 --> 00:11:17,620
You think that she could have meant farther inside?

385
00:20:12,012 --> 00:20:14,756
Chitanda, do you happen to have any kind of string?

418
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:46,079
Chitanda, I need to borrow your purse for a minute.

433
00:22:24,454 --> 00:22:27,155
It's over that way, right next to the Inari statue.

441
00:22:49,672 --> 00:22:52,022
The phrase was coined at a famous historical event.

446
00:23:01,256 --> 00:23:04,131
When Nobunaga was laying siege to the Asakura clan,

32
00:03:05,299 --> 00:03:08,405
It's not a big deal or anything, I just had an idea.

56
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:44,464
Running around bringing New Year's gifts to priests?

327
00:17:46,089 --> 00:17:48,621
Is she still embarrassed about her attendant outfit?

450
00:23:15,997 --> 00:23:18,456
I don't know how much of the story is actually true,

454
00:23:28,922 --> 00:23:31,398
Knowing how his mind works, he'll get what it means.

273
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:47,057
Look, we'll only shout out for help as a last resort.

37
00:03:35,539 --> 00:03:37,983
I guess a lot of people like to get dressed up for it.

100
00:07:12,273 --> 00:07:14,999
Oh, don't scare him like that. Please accept our gift.

352
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,856
And to make matters worse, it's been emptied out, too.

102
00:07:18,323 --> 00:07:20,902
They're messing with me, and I freaked out like a dork.

196
00:11:12,914 --> 00:11:15,316
There's nothing but a wall to the left, where she said.

425
00:22:04,605 --> 00:22:07,147
The parishioners said they found this by the shed, too!

438
00:22:42,765 --> 00:22:45,546
You know the expression, "like a rat trapped in a bag?"

4
00:00:20,089 --> 00:00:22,540
But that doesn't make much sense, if you think about it.

110
00:07:39,278 --> 00:07:42,146
We'd like to see Mayaka Ibara. Do you know where she is?

139
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:47,208
The parishioners who volunteer are a little overzealous,

248
00:13:42,523 --> 00:13:44,881
If someone comes in to get something and finds us alone,

281
00:15:06,922 --> 00:15:09,741
Three, we dig a tunnel to the outside through the floor.

309
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:42,413
I'm pretty sure Mayaka has seen me use it several times.

312
00:16:50,061 --> 00:16:52,260
Okay, Chitanda, drop your handkerchief through the hole.

6
00:00:26,196 --> 00:00:28,723
for the rest of the year, which is completely ridiculous.

62
00:04:58,126 --> 00:05:01,094
I got in some good practice on my hermit crab impression.

76
00:05:55,672 --> 00:05:58,306
On behalf of Tetsugo Chitanda and the rest of our family,

91
00:06:47,906 --> 00:06:50,698
I have brought a bottle of saké as a gift from my father.

226
00:12:41,276 --> 00:12:43,506
I'm about to scream as loud as I can, so cover your ears.

258
00:14:04,213 --> 00:14:06,922
I didn't bring my phone with me. We'll have to use yours.

342
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,360
I thought that our handkerchief plan would work for sure,

344
00:18:29,211 --> 00:18:31,978
I guess my hanky didn't leave a strong enough impression.

366
00:19:17,643 --> 00:19:20,423
I'm regretting the decision not to wear my haori, though.

183
00:10:36,358 --> 00:10:39,442
Well, is there anything else I can do to be of assistance?

424
00:22:01,464 --> 00:22:04,506
I'm willing to bet this is Hotaro's bad luck hard at work.

140
00:08:47,352 --> 00:08:50,306
so if anything at all gets
found, they bring it right here.

236
00:13:04,131 --> 00:13:07,161
unbar the door, and we'd be
free to finish what we started.

262
00:14:15,511 --> 00:14:18,226
Well, we can't take the door
off its hinges from this side.

184
00:10:41,714 --> 00:10:44,331
Yeah, could you bring in some
saké lees from the storehouse?

274
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:50,243
Until then, let's brainstorm
for anything else we could try.

285
00:15:16,462 --> 00:15:19,123
but it's still one of the
Arekusu shrine's sacred buildings!

442
00:22:52,445 --> 00:22:55,008
You've probably heard of the
Battle of Anegawa, haven't you?

322
00:17:30,412 --> 00:17:33,519
Sorry I can't show you around,
but you can go in on your own.

370
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:28,400
I really wish I had worn a
trenchcoat myself right about now.

10
00:00:34,069 --> 00:00:36,914
Not to be rude, but right now
I am a little bit more concerned

22
00:02:42,856 --> 00:02:46,023
Great! Well, do you want to
visit the Arekusu Shrine that day?

177
00:10:20,631 --> 00:10:23,467
One of the part-timers knocked
over some pots and made a mess.

337
00:18:06,886 --> 00:18:10,127
It looks a lot like one that
Chi has, but I'm not really sure.

379
00:19:51,964 --> 00:19:55,081
That doesn't give me an excuse
to make you suffer for it, too.

182
00:10:32,881 --> 00:10:35,860
Not so fast! There's no way I'd
let you cook dressed like that!

249
00:13:44,906 --> 00:13:47,544
not making a peep, they're
definitely gonna get the wrong idea.

11
00:00:36,993 --> 00:00:40,672
about our current predicament
than I am about the next 364 days.

33
00:03:09,278 --> 00:03:12,973
I kind of feel like wearing my
kimono, but I'm a little nervous.

209
00:11:42,565 --> 00:11:46,317
Oh, my family doesn't have a
storehouse, so I just got confused!

233
00:12:55,422 --> 00:12:58,589
Because... If someone out there
hears and comes to let us out...

243
00:13:27,688 --> 00:13:30,506
but tonight would be the worst
possible time for them to find us.

276
00:14:52,563 --> 00:14:56,042
We can't move the bar, call out,
or take the door off its hinges,

167
00:09:57,714 --> 00:10:00,939
I've never known anyone who got
a bad luck fortune before tonight!

339
00:18:13,409 --> 00:18:16,324
When you see Chitanda in a little
while, you can ask her about it.

71
00:05:40,145 --> 00:05:43,775
May I only expend a moderate
amount of energy for this entire year.

375
00:19:41,172 --> 00:19:44,195
but she hasn't skipped out on
work to come investigate or anything.

290
00:15:45,797 --> 00:15:48,885
And from what I can tell, it looks
like he found a cell phone strap.

270
00:14:36,047 --> 00:14:39,503
I'd rather risk my reputation than
risk either of us catching a cold.

237
00:13:07,506 --> 00:13:10,474
But how would it look when they
opened the door and found us together?

255
00:13:57,775 --> 00:14:01,065
Our cell phones! We can just shoot
them a text and they'll let us out!

338
00:18:10,299 --> 00:18:13,313
It's convenient that you might know
who the owner is, don't you think?

377
00:19:45,987 --> 00:19:49,250
I appreciate you indulging my
selfish request for as long as you have.

88
00:06:40,672 --> 00:06:43,664
And I look forward to happy relations
with you in the coming year, too.

302
00:16:19,047 --> 00:16:22,481
So we can drop something out there
that obviously belongs to one of us.

406
00:20:59,506 --> 00:21:03,208
If you took off the <i>obijime</i>, would
the rest of the kimono hold up okay?

14
00:00:48,172 --> 00:00:51,651
I'd say it's mostly because you
picked an unlucky fortune, wouldn't you?

138
00:08:40,422 --> 00:08:44,093
I also give change, and it's the
lost and found for kids and belongings.

59
00:04:48,429 --> 00:04:52,276
I spent all morning and afternoon
visiting relatives and paying respects.

126
00:08:16,297 --> 00:08:19,598
I'm not allowed to wear the ones
with long sleeves until I go to college.

29
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:01,214
Fukube said that it sounds like fun
and that he'll be joining us, as well.

250
00:13:48,075 --> 00:13:52,199
The only people here who wouldn't
jump to conclusions are Kaho and Mayaka.

129
00:08:23,256 --> 00:08:26,558
I think we'll just stay in the main
hall area and wait for you to get done.

444
00:22:56,027 --> 00:22:59,131
There's a legendary story that happened
right before that; have you heard it?

299
00:16:10,622 --> 00:16:14,078
drops something of value, the parishioners
bring it over to the shrine office.

389
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:23,787
Once we get that, I have a sure-fire
way of alerting Satoshi to our situation.

199
00:11:20,456 --> 00:11:23,689
I thought this would just be a quick
errand, but it's turning out to be a pain.

297
00:16:03,073 --> 00:16:06,973
Listen, Chitanda, do you think it'd be
okay to break open the wall just a little?

5
00:00:22,876 --> 00:00:26,171
Otherwise, it would mean that if you took
New Year's Day off, then you would be off

66
00:05:19,547 --> 00:05:23,261
I don't know. Mayaka's the one who talked
to him about coming here with us tonight.

448
00:23:07,283 --> 00:23:11,637
Nobunaga's sister, Oichi, sent a bean bag
tied up at both ends to him in the field,

185
00:10:44,442 --> 00:10:47,834
They're right to your left when you walk
in, so you should be able to recognize them.

277
00:14:56,155 --> 00:15:00,199
but there are still four avenues of escape
we haven't explored yet, so don't give up.

304
00:16:26,515 --> 00:16:29,896
If we could somehow convey our current
predicament to her, she would come let us out!

332
00:17:56,089 --> 00:17:59,540
It was an absolute masterpiece! I couldn't
have asked for a better start to the year!

213
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:58,250
I remembered that the <i>mikoshi</i> storage room
is right next to the shrine office, though.

178
00:10:23,571 --> 00:10:27,599
Now we have to whip up a ton of dumpling
soup and sweet saké on the fly for the guests.

264
00:14:21,506 --> 00:14:25,089
I didn't know you didn't have a cell phone,
and that's why I said not to shout for help.

453
00:23:23,714 --> 00:23:28,647
It just so happens that Satoshi and I both
saw that episode play out on a TV show today.

437
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:42,193
When you tie off the opening and the bottom,
that closes up all the contents inside of it.

303
00:16:22,506 --> 00:16:26,416
When they bring it to her, she would recognize it
and pay closer attention to it than other things.

266
00:14:26,608 --> 00:14:30,986
I just blanked for a few minutes on who to call,
but when it dawned on me, it didn't matter anymore.

413
00:21:15,339 --> 00:21:19,931
If you don't mind my asking, how are you going to
get help from Fukube using a little bit of string?

2
00:00:13,089 --> 00:00:17,273
Isn't there a superstition that whatever you do on
New Year's Day, you'll end up doing all year long?

306
00:16:32,007 --> 00:16:36,220
Whether or not she makes the connection to the shed
is the hard part, so we'll need all the luck we can get.

55
00:04:37,315 --> 00:04:42,066
My family does business with the priests here, so I
wanted to bring them a New Year's present from my father.

240
00:13:16,131 --> 00:13:21,356
If they came to rescue us, they would recognize me, and
if they saw us in here together, they would misunderstand!
