56
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:08,042
No.

432
00:23:20,793 --> 00:23:21,468
No.

448
00:23:56,861 --> 00:23:57,528
So?

31
00:02:49,447 --> 00:02:49,875
Yes.

38
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:03,473
Hmm?

73
00:05:15,667 --> 00:05:16,606
Man!

208
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:05,666
Yes.

214
00:12:15,335 --> 00:12:16,065
One.

241
00:13:21,042 --> 00:13:21,611
Huh?

289
00:15:26,178 --> 00:15:26,630
Huh?

23
00:02:32,792 --> 00:02:33,274
What?

40
00:03:05,792 --> 00:03:06,403
Sure.

104
00:06:54,361 --> 00:06:54,909
Oh...

161
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:06,157
Okay.

277
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,928
Okay.

286
00:15:12,702 --> 00:15:13,393
Okay.

320
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,139
Yeah.

334
00:18:01,202 --> 00:18:02,052
Sure.

356
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:46,257
Even?

377
00:20:46,917 --> 00:20:47,751
I am.

383
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:03,872
Yeah.

420
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:51,856
Look.

423
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:56,491
What?

434
00:23:25,625 --> 00:23:26,156
So...

441
00:23:39,792 --> 00:23:40,606
I do!

460
00:24:43,736 --> 00:24:44,281
Yeah.

463
00:24:50,579 --> 00:24:51,111
Good.

467
00:25:00,688 --> 00:25:01,335
Sure.

7
00:00:18,697 --> 00:00:19,619
I see.

79
00:05:29,042 --> 00:05:29,651
What?!

81
00:05:41,854 --> 00:05:42,920
Itchy.

93
00:06:24,156 --> 00:06:25,052
Sorry.

102
00:06:50,174 --> 00:06:50,715
Hmm...

144
00:09:12,089 --> 00:09:12,920
Oreki!

188
00:11:21,542 --> 00:11:22,040
Right.

244
00:13:30,167 --> 00:13:30,891
Umm...

445
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:51,468
We do!

32
00:02:49,925 --> 00:02:51,060
Hooray!

66
00:04:50,213 --> 00:04:50,976
Uh-huh.

115
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:21,683
No way!

121
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:50,501
Hotaro.

217
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:21,689
Mm-hmm.

232
00:13:02,428 --> 00:13:03,313
Coming!

238
00:13:14,663 --> 00:13:15,198
Well...

394
00:21:34,667 --> 00:21:35,404
Mayaka.

417
00:22:46,862 --> 00:22:47,886
Mayaka!

450
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,198
No way.

470
00:25:29,529 --> 00:25:30,280
Bitter.

131
00:08:16,902 --> 00:08:17,726
Satoshi.

154
00:09:39,347 --> 00:09:40,273
Satoshi.

199
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:45,024
Perfect.

202
00:11:51,286 --> 00:11:51,975
Hold on.

215
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:17,734
And two.

283
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:06,846
Satoshi!

295
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:40,818
Ibara...

465
00:24:54,228 --> 00:24:55,028
Oreki...

21
00:02:29,863 --> 00:02:30,693
Mayaka...

24
00:02:33,577 --> 00:02:34,410
Ruthless.

148
00:09:24,932 --> 00:09:25,861
For real?

271
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:34,692
Hotaro...

419
00:22:50,032 --> 00:22:51,056
Hey, Chi.

11
00:00:28,692 --> 00:00:29,461
Next year,

30
00:02:48,538 --> 00:02:49,423
Seriously?

37
00:03:01,593 --> 00:03:02,702
Oh, Oreki?

41
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:08,986
I mean it.

171
00:10:38,426 --> 00:10:39,343
Trapezoid?

216
00:12:18,476 --> 00:12:19,354
And three?

255
00:13:55,917 --> 00:13:56,760
Hey, guys.

421
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,673
I'm sorry!

471
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:07,055
Next time:

8
00:00:19,708 --> 00:00:21,317
Okay, fine!

27
00:02:41,923 --> 00:02:43,315
Let me see.

118
00:07:25,402 --> 00:07:26,553
Uh... yeah.

120
00:07:28,494 --> 00:07:30,246
Yeah. Sure.

134
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:41,895
Hey, Oreki.

221
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:34,792
But then...

237
00:13:13,206 --> 00:13:14,611
Yeah? What?

398
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:45,042
What, then?

44
00:03:21,232 --> 00:03:22,296
Hey, Hotaro!

112
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:16,000
But still...

173
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,784
What? Hmm...

452
00:24:08,971 --> 00:24:09,971
That said...

456
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:20,530
That's good.

85
00:06:07,928 --> 00:06:09,072
Fine, thanks.

101
00:06:47,951 --> 00:06:48,959
It's too bad.

135
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:43,714
Oh. Chitanda.

190
00:11:26,567 --> 00:11:27,734
Satoshi, too?

201
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:51,261
That's lucky!

211
00:12:08,792 --> 00:12:09,757
Three people?

331
00:17:44,761 --> 00:17:45,773
Okay, I will.

87
00:06:12,178 --> 00:06:13,340
It's finished.

127
00:08:01,124 --> 00:08:02,422
Yeah. Sure am.

141
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:56,902
If you say so.

155
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:41,814
What happened?

185
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:15,349
No, I haven't.

96
00:06:34,917 --> 00:06:36,120
It's admirable.

226
00:12:48,417 --> 00:12:49,419
Leave me alone.

230
00:12:57,417 --> 00:12:58,341
Why would they?

235
00:13:09,757 --> 00:13:10,901
Never mind her.

250
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,241
No, nobody did.

339
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:40,641
It was Satoshi.

364
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,094
What if it was?

399
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:46,034
That's the rub.

446
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,330
Well, Hotaro...

22
00:02:31,803 --> 00:02:32,767
I will help you!

157
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:45,469
The chocolate...

165
00:10:21,772 --> 00:10:23,700
Ah. Oreki, wait.

180
00:10:59,018 --> 00:11:00,421
Just after five.

195
00:11:35,385 --> 00:11:36,206
Wait, which guy?

252
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,879
That's Nakayama.

299
00:15:49,018 --> 00:15:50,353
I feel terrible!

34
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:56,379
You have my word.

49
00:03:34,246 --> 00:03:35,364
I hadn't, either.

105
00:06:56,988 --> 00:06:58,914
Hey, Oreki. Um...

107
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:04,800
And in my family,

125
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:58,832
or turns to snow.

132
00:08:18,659 --> 00:08:19,767
Good luck to you.

209
00:12:06,167 --> 00:12:07,333
Yeah, I remember.

291
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:32,147
Listen. Mayaka...

357
00:19:46,601 --> 00:19:47,766
Yeah, last April.

437
00:23:33,667 --> 00:23:34,950
That makes sense.

36
00:02:59,329 --> 00:03:00,652
Okay, it's a date.

78
00:05:27,809 --> 00:05:28,934
Who is your crush?

111
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,792
Does this mean...?

119
00:07:27,168 --> 00:07:28,221
Shall we go, then?

137
00:08:46,093 --> 00:08:47,082
He didn't show up?

152
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:35,880
And as a result...

156
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:44,221
Well... You see...

177
00:10:51,577 --> 00:10:52,706
That's pretty big.

204
00:11:54,377 --> 00:11:55,225
That's not likely.

206
00:12:01,031 --> 00:12:02,179
Yeah, fair enough.

259
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:07,658
Turned down again?

260
00:14:10,204 --> 00:14:11,245
There you have it.

269
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:30,347
Of course she was.

279
00:14:56,668 --> 00:14:57,796
I'll go check now!

307
00:16:26,952 --> 00:16:28,122
Please step aside.

314
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:47,000
She deserved that!

440
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:39,708
You think so, too?

53
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:49,873
Airport. Get ready.

159
00:09:48,718 --> 00:09:50,135
...has been stolen!

267
00:14:25,917 --> 00:14:27,224
She seemed annoyed.

292
00:15:32,171 --> 00:15:33,025
What did you think?

294
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,720
She wasted no time.

305
00:16:08,296 --> 00:16:09,838
I'm going home now.

418
00:22:49,042 --> 00:22:49,917
Please, wait a sec!

172
00:10:39,426 --> 00:10:40,635
It dropped too much.

174
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:44,619
How did that happen?

301
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,862
Mayaka. I apologize.

308
00:16:28,551 --> 00:16:29,551
Where are you going?

333
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:59,050
Should we get going?

442
00:23:40,792 --> 00:23:42,187
It's just appalling!

14
00:02:12,792 --> 00:02:14,182
Yes, it is difficult.

170
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:38,303
It's kind of crooked.

192
00:11:31,319 --> 00:11:32,569
Ah, that makes sense.

296
00:15:40,843 --> 00:15:42,297
I'm so sorry, Mayaka.

1
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:04,042
All right, then, Fuku.

43
00:03:18,962 --> 00:03:20,254
That's Satoshi's bike.

123
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:55,042
No, too cold in there.

194
00:11:34,114 --> 00:11:35,085
How long was he there?

210
00:12:07,417 --> 00:12:08,669
There were only three.

268
00:14:27,396 --> 00:14:28,938
Or did I imagine that?

302
00:15:58,902 --> 00:16:00,252
Please don't feel bad.

319
00:17:11,978 --> 00:17:13,216
Do you have a suspect?

352
00:19:21,167 --> 00:19:22,304
he'd have been caught.

427
00:23:06,375 --> 00:23:07,453
Then the chocolate...?

126
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:00,731
But you are, I take it?

168
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:33,116
Oh, excuse me a second.

233
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:07,072
What? Classic Lit Club?

248
00:13:40,167 --> 00:13:41,584
Three out of five, huh?

340
00:18:41,189 --> 00:18:43,096
Excellent work, Hotaro.

370
00:20:31,835 --> 00:20:33,292
Hotaro, be honest, now.

387
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:15,756
I couldn't handle that.

468
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,413
Hello, Mayaka? It's me.

50
00:03:38,281 --> 00:03:39,687
I'll take the Viper Two.

65
00:04:46,736 --> 00:04:48,527
I mean it. That was fun.

196
00:11:36,603 --> 00:11:37,722
The one with the poster.

229
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:57,333
That's a great question.

361
00:19:57,542 --> 00:19:58,834
Except for you, that is.

424
00:22:57,708 --> 00:22:59,292
The truth is, last year,

431
00:23:19,208 --> 00:23:20,507
I'm sorry I tricked you.

2
00:00:04,095 --> 00:00:05,723
Let me get this straight.

80
00:05:30,572 --> 00:05:33,369
Well, um... I don't know.

130
00:08:10,986 --> 00:08:12,275
Well, I'll see you later.

158
00:09:46,103 --> 00:09:48,060
Mayaka's labor of love...

163
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:11,944
She worked so hard on it,

258
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:05,904
I really wish that I had!

10
00:00:26,991 --> 00:00:28,667
I won't forget about this!

29
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:48,497
Want me to show you where?

57
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:09,814
This is a definite change.

117
00:07:23,615 --> 00:07:25,171
Well, we're gonna be late!

150
00:09:29,579 --> 00:09:31,327
This is entirely my fault.

153
00:09:36,197 --> 00:09:38,374
Mayaka will be devastated.

175
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:46,946
It was sitting right here!

285
00:15:09,601 --> 00:15:10,976
Just keep your mouth shut.

395
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:37,867
Mayaka is awesome. Really.

411
00:22:23,619 --> 00:22:25,800
Exactly. It's been a year.

4
00:00:11,628 --> 00:00:13,811
So you refuse to accept it.

62
00:04:33,978 --> 00:04:35,712
Is he trying to draw me in?

169
00:10:33,292 --> 00:10:35,156
Um... Does this look level?

265
00:14:22,792 --> 00:14:24,250
Okay, let's get back to it!

287
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:20,678
It wasn't in there, either.

329
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,083
Let me take over from here.

330
00:17:40,167 --> 00:17:42,042
You just go home and relax.

392
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:30,193
I can have a good time now.

403
00:21:58,583 --> 00:21:59,971
It's all about what I want.

114
00:07:19,335 --> 00:07:20,835
It's supposed to snow today.

193
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:34,030
And the Industrial Arts guy?

253
00:13:50,042 --> 00:13:51,952
Just so you know, Detective,

264
00:14:19,785 --> 00:14:21,886
Fine. I guess I forgive you.

300
00:15:52,523 --> 00:15:55,596
Really? So someone stole it?

304
00:16:05,576 --> 00:16:07,593
Although, it is unfortunate.

324
00:17:24,433 --> 00:17:25,792
You could try to conceal it,

368
00:20:21,425 --> 00:20:23,637
I'd rather not say. Still...

429
00:23:12,583 --> 00:23:15,732
Huh... That's what happened.

438
00:23:35,208 --> 00:23:36,875
But that's so mean of Fukube

35
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:58,785
Have they forgotten I'm here?

90
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:19,833
I'll bet that was no problem.

139
00:08:51,234 --> 00:08:53,032
I saw him a half an hour ago.

207
00:12:03,419 --> 00:12:05,100
People who've passed by here?

223
00:12:40,109 --> 00:12:41,815
I have to say, this is weird.

376
00:20:45,417 --> 00:20:46,797
And you're different somehow?

6
00:00:15,565 --> 00:00:18,467
Yeah. That is what I'm saying.

51
00:03:39,792 --> 00:03:41,291
You'll take the Raiden, right?

71
00:05:02,627 --> 00:05:05,387
Yeah. This is the new Satoshi.

355
00:19:43,542 --> 00:19:45,090
I guess this means we're even.

5
00:00:13,836 --> 00:00:15,471
Is that what you're telling me?

39
00:03:03,696 --> 00:03:05,332
Don't you say anything, either.

63
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,168
Man! That sure was a good game!

70
00:05:00,991 --> 00:05:02,533
It's more adventurous that way.

92
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:23,469
That's not a nice thing to say!

110
00:07:11,167 --> 00:07:13,917
Also... not on Valentine's Day.

143
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:08,272
Fukube's late? Something's off.

212
00:12:10,917 --> 00:12:12,667
Well, what did they look like?!

273
00:14:37,698 --> 00:14:39,165
We'll plan our next step there.

409
00:22:18,388 --> 00:22:20,246
I'm terrified by that prospect.

453
00:24:10,277 --> 00:24:11,790
What are you going to tell her?

9
00:00:21,692 --> 00:00:23,526
If that's how you really feel...

240
00:13:19,427 --> 00:13:20,958
if you might have seen anything.

290
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,909
What are you guys doing in here?

311
00:16:38,893 --> 00:16:40,010
This isn't your fault, you know.

33
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:55,147
Promise that you won't tell Fuku.

64
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,596
Way to work that joystick, buddy.

84
00:06:05,792 --> 00:06:07,628
Good morning, Oreki. How are you?

113
00:07:16,059 --> 00:07:19,203
So she's saying... what, exactly?

160
00:10:01,292 --> 00:10:03,377
All right. I'll help you find it.

203
00:11:52,335 --> 00:11:54,293
Isn't it possible that he did it?

261
00:14:11,401 --> 00:14:13,093
Anything else you'd like to know?

266
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:25,833
Too late, you're out of the game!

366
00:20:15,417 --> 00:20:17,886
For Chitanda and Ibara. By force.

405
00:22:04,316 --> 00:22:06,183
I know that sounds self-centered,

451
00:24:06,257 --> 00:24:08,168
I really don't wanna get beat up.

59
00:04:24,528 --> 00:04:26,577
He would play to win at all costs.

61
00:04:32,087 --> 00:04:33,782
Let's switch players and go again!

91
00:06:19,917 --> 00:06:21,458
She probably gobbled all of it up.

140
00:08:53,292 --> 00:08:55,186
He was on his way to the clubroom.

197
00:11:38,218 --> 00:11:39,962
You mean the boy with the glasses?

234
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:09,129
Kindly give us back our chocolate!

282
00:15:04,684 --> 00:15:05,894
So you're saying there's a chance?

288
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:24,128
Well, that leaves one more option.

293
00:15:33,277 --> 00:15:36,917
How was it? My homemade chocolate?

306
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:11,771
For real, don't let it bother you.

321
00:17:15,002 --> 00:17:17,094
Nakayama, from the Astronomy Club.

332
00:17:46,368 --> 00:17:47,894
I'm trusting you with this, Oreki.

338
00:18:36,906 --> 00:18:39,036
I did know who took the chocolate.

367
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:19,999
Well, I don't want to get beat up.

373
00:20:37,995 --> 00:20:39,544
That's where you're wrong, though.

402
00:21:56,405 --> 00:21:58,318
But I don't want to fixate on her.

464
00:24:51,692 --> 00:24:53,432
So don't give it too much thought.

15
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,042
But I'm still not going to give up!

55
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,667
Is this how Satoshi usually fights?

67
00:04:52,202 --> 00:04:54,702
Hey... toward the end of the round,

68
00:04:54,814 --> 00:04:56,649
why did you charge in like you did?

129
00:08:07,305 --> 00:08:10,496
Word travels fast. Chitanda, right?

227
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:52,024
We'll be able to find it, won't we?

317
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:05,304
But please just let me handle this.

349
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:12,506
But it was bigger than he expected.

396
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:39,623
There's truly no one else like her,

439
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:38,625
to play along like he didn't do it!

454
00:24:12,365 --> 00:24:14,197
When will you give Ibara an answer?

52
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:43,395
It's the only one I know how to use.

133
00:08:21,413 --> 00:08:23,264
What on Earth would I need luck for?

151
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:33,886
I carelessly left the room unlocked.

281
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:03,834
The odds are about one in a million.

284
00:15:07,452 --> 00:15:09,166
I have a good idea of what happened.

344
00:18:54,934 --> 00:18:57,476
Satoshi said, "it dropped too much."

346
00:19:00,175 --> 00:19:01,924
he wouldn't have responded that way.

365
00:20:13,667 --> 00:20:15,320
Then I'd have to teach you a lesson.

380
00:20:53,795 --> 00:20:55,775
I'm no longer trying to be the best.

389
00:21:19,531 --> 00:21:21,882
So one day I just decided to let go.

77
00:05:25,707 --> 00:05:27,633
By the way, Chi, I've been wondering.

136
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:46,042
Do you have any idea where Fukube is?

184
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:14,101
Have you mentioned this to Ibara yet?

187
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:21,364
And it's definitely not in this room.

224
00:12:42,692 --> 00:12:44,333
You're really getting into this, huh.

372
00:20:35,822 --> 00:20:37,905
I think you fixate on your interests.

462
00:24:47,894 --> 00:24:50,310
Did you really? That's such a relief.

469
00:25:14,125 --> 00:25:16,343
Listen, I really need to talk to you.

17
00:02:19,817 --> 00:02:21,642
and if stupid Fuku has any complaints,

76
00:05:22,829 --> 00:05:25,272
I really hope you're right about that.

142
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:58,666
I'll wait for him a little bit longer.

353
00:19:22,801 --> 00:19:25,291
Which meant his only option was clear.

385
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:11,069
It stopped being fun for me, you know?

426
00:23:03,353 --> 00:23:05,420
This whole thing was just to test him.

455
00:24:16,311 --> 00:24:18,552
I think my answer will come very soon.

72
00:05:05,842 --> 00:05:07,810
He's changed a lot since middle school.

106
00:06:59,551 --> 00:07:02,473
Today is... Well, it's Valentines' Day.

147
00:09:21,692 --> 00:09:23,276
Sorry, you'll have to tell me tomorrow.

149
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:28,841
I'm sorry, but you need to hear me out.

167
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,461
Then let's use the east stairs instead.

263
00:14:15,901 --> 00:14:18,138
and I truly didn't mean any disrespect.

371
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,293
Do I strike you as the compulsive type?

382
00:21:00,595 --> 00:21:02,656
I wasn't obsessed with winning anymore?

404
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,434
I don't even consider how Mayaka feels.

47
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:31,098
I guess there's no reason to hurry home.

48
00:03:32,271 --> 00:03:34,146
I haven't been here since middle school.

88
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:15,731
It turned out to be quite a bit of work.

145
00:09:13,417 --> 00:09:15,986
Please wait! Something awful's happened!

225
00:12:44,817 --> 00:12:46,565
It could start sleeting again, you know.

335
00:18:12,225 --> 00:18:15,376
Satoshi. Let me see your drawstring bag.

20
00:02:27,292 --> 00:02:29,550
I'll cram that chocolate down his throat!

54
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:00,058
I was sure he'd focus on evasion tactics.

89
00:06:16,194 --> 00:06:18,329
She had to sample all kinds of chocolate.

122
00:07:51,418 --> 00:07:53,255
Hey, are you on your way to the clubroom?

315
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:58,757
I can't say I identify with how you feel.

325
00:17:25,917 --> 00:17:27,587
but it would make your movements awkward.

336
00:18:29,106 --> 00:18:31,614
I am now giving Ibara's chocolate to you.

360
00:19:54,917 --> 00:19:57,015
but no one was hurt in the process there.

472
00:27:07,253 --> 00:27:09,444
"The Doll That Took the Long Way Around."

19
00:02:24,974 --> 00:02:27,267
And if he still wants to give me attitude,

109
00:07:08,292 --> 00:07:10,425
not in the way a lot of other families do.

276
00:14:50,792 --> 00:14:52,736
but there was no sign that they were used.

316
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:02,024
I'm not as sensitive to others as you are.

414
00:22:34,777 --> 00:22:37,192
But you also hurt Chitanda in the process.

75
00:05:20,216 --> 00:05:22,651
I'm certain that he'll accept it this year.

97
00:06:37,157 --> 00:06:39,836
So, what's she gonna do with the chocolate?

138
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:50,237
No. I thought something arose unexpectedly.

262
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:15,660
No, that's it. Thank you all for your time,

378
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,889
I'm never going to be the best at anything,

410
00:22:21,588 --> 00:22:23,504
That's why you didn't accept the chocolate?

457
00:24:26,583 --> 00:24:29,880
For all your deftness, you're still clumsy.

348
00:19:08,135 --> 00:19:10,385
Then he got the chocolate from the clubroom.

391
00:21:25,853 --> 00:21:28,636
Once that changed, I could enjoy life again.

46
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:27,905
So... Wanna play a game, for old time's sake?

74
00:05:16,726 --> 00:05:19,441
It does me no good to tense up and overthink!

99
00:06:42,644 --> 00:06:44,643
She couldn't manage to get out of Manga Club.

337
00:18:31,894 --> 00:18:34,133
This fulfills the promise I made to Chitanda.

359
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:54,497
Ah, you're right. I had forgotten about that,

98
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,514
Well, from what she told me, it's complicated.

164
00:10:12,059 --> 00:10:13,896
and I don't have much of a stomach for horror.

213
00:12:12,702 --> 00:12:15,064
Were there any distinguishing characteristics?

242
00:13:21,922 --> 00:13:24,568
Sounds like we've got ourselves a love bandit!

393
00:21:31,754 --> 00:21:34,316
But there was one little problem with my plan.

86
00:06:09,221 --> 00:06:11,838
So how did Ibara's chocolate experiment end up?

228
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:55,885
Even so, why would anyone just steal like that?

236
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:13,079
We just came to ask you a question, that's all!

303
00:16:00,379 --> 00:16:03,542
You have no reason to be sorry, Chi, seriously.

323
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,206
So it couldn't be hidden under a guy's uniform.

428
00:23:07,938 --> 00:23:10,424
I'm pretty sure that he's the one who stole it.

444
00:23:47,168 --> 00:23:49,609
That's it, Chi. We deserve some cake right now!

447
00:23:54,444 --> 00:23:56,695
Now you've heard everything that I have to say.

83
00:05:54,377 --> 00:05:56,973
trembling with what you could call, 'sympathy.'"

280
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:01,658
Do you really think it could be in the bathroom?

313
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:45,793
Today was supposed to be a happy day for Mayaka.

412
00:22:25,877 --> 00:22:28,485
And I still haven't figured out a real solution.

116
00:07:21,723 --> 00:07:23,590
I didn't even bring any gloves. I'm such a dummy.

179
00:10:56,702 --> 00:10:58,824
Right, and when did you get back to the clubroom?

183
00:11:09,138 --> 00:11:11,592
It's completely my fault for having been so late.

298
00:15:45,827 --> 00:15:48,382
and someone stole the chocolate while I was gone.

400
00:21:47,321 --> 00:21:50,444
How can that be okay? To be so obsessed with her?

219
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:28,865
Satoshi, what clubrooms are located on this floor?

251
00:13:46,316 --> 00:13:48,449
So that girl in the group over there, is that Oda?

322
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:21,265
Ibara's chocolate was a pretty decent size, right?

326
00:17:28,042 --> 00:17:30,574
It would be easier with the girls' sailor uniform.

363
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:09,917
And don't even try to say that it was just a joke.

375
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:45,333
when they are truly passionate about what they do.

124
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:57,338
I'm gonna wait in the library till the sleet stops,

254
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:55,084
nobody came in this room with any stolen chocolate!

341
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:46,583
The moment I heard the chocolate had been "stolen,"

458
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:37,287
"Sorry. I now see I don't know anything about you."

69
00:04:58,035 --> 00:05:00,811
When it comes to robot fights, hand-to-hand is best.

249
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:44,841
Did anyone start to pack up their things to go home?

390
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:25,482
I chose to be particular about not being particular.

406
00:22:06,717 --> 00:22:09,115
but I don't want to take Mayaka for granted, either.

297
00:15:42,886 --> 00:15:45,538
I left the room for a few minutes to look for Fukube.

354
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:38,805
You didn't even think twice about breaking it in half.

369
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:26,314
I guess I'm gonna have to tell you one way or another.

401
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:56,229
I want to be with her, there's no question about that.

415
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:41,730
Things don't work for me the same way they do for you.

128
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:07,040
Apparently, Ibara's stuck in Manga Club and can't come.

408
00:22:14,392 --> 00:22:17,116
I take the chance that I'll revert back to my old ways.

422
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:55,909
I actually know who stole the chocolate, already, okay?

245
00:13:31,066 --> 00:13:33,576
We were pretty much already in the swing of things here.

272
00:14:34,956 --> 00:14:37,362
For now, I think we should just go back to the clubroom.

342
00:18:46,642 --> 00:18:49,558
I suspected that Satoshi had taken it from the clubroom.

379
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:53,258
but to be more specific, I've given up any chance of it.

416
00:22:42,668 --> 00:22:45,543
I didn't think about Chitanda when I dreamt all this up.

430
00:23:16,093 --> 00:23:19,093
I feel really terrible that you went to so much trouble.

461
00:24:44,868 --> 00:24:47,775
I ended up getting the chocolate back safely to Satoshi.

25
00:02:34,474 --> 00:02:37,660
If there's anything I can do for you, please let me know!

182
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:09,042
Chitanda, there's no need to beat yourself up about this.

231
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:01,153
Why don't we start by exploring all of the possibilities?

278
00:14:54,309 --> 00:14:56,517
Come to think of it, we didn't check the girls' restroom.

351
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:21,083
If he didn't hide it, and happened to bump into Chitanda,

466
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,912
I want to thank you for everything you did to help today.

45
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:25,125
What a crazy coincidence, running into you here like this.

312
00:16:40,058 --> 00:16:42,838
You're wrong, and I can't
forgive myself for what happened!

345
00:18:57,583 --> 00:19:00,083
Unless he had told the kid to
drop it at some point earlier,

362
00:20:03,042 --> 00:20:05,429
Well, are you at least gonna
tell me exactly why you did it?

13
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,760
Making chocolate from cocoa
beans is just too hard, isn't it?

449
00:24:02,111 --> 00:24:04,831
This is probably not something
we should share with Chitanda.

459
00:24:37,917 --> 00:24:40,963
That's what I thought, but I
couldn't bring myself to say it.

425
00:22:59,391 --> 00:23:02,933
I told Fuku I'd wait till this
Valentine's Day for his answer.

246
00:13:34,111 --> 00:13:36,817
I don't know what time, but
Nakayama and Yoshihara stepped out.

327
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:33,514
If you strapped it to your leg,
the skirt would hide it easily.

388
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:18,561
If you don't have fun when you
win, what's the point of it all?

436
00:23:30,215 --> 00:23:33,583
I think that he was just telling
a white lie to cover for Fuku.

247
00:13:36,865 --> 00:13:40,083
Oda might have left, too, but
again, I don't know when they did.

256
00:13:56,785 --> 00:14:00,096
Did any of you catch a whiff or
a glance of anything chocolatey?

103
00:06:51,362 --> 00:06:54,218
I think Satoshi's going to be
thrilled with the whole production.

274
00:14:42,877 --> 00:14:46,077
Is there any way to get to the
fourth floor besides the stairway?

146
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:21,541
It finally stopped sleeting, and
I was just about to head on home.

243
00:13:24,813 --> 00:13:29,294
Did you see anyone suspicious up
here between around 4:45 and 5:00?

270
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:33,875
But we have to do everything we
can to get Mayaka's chocolate back!

343
00:18:51,311 --> 00:18:54,875
My suspicions were confirmed when
we talked to the boy on the stairs.

94
00:06:25,542 --> 00:06:28,801
But anyway, because of that, she
was able to complete her masterpiece.

328
00:17:34,581 --> 00:17:37,986
I promise I'll get Ibara's chocolate
to Satoshi by the end of the day.

310
00:16:34,542 --> 00:16:38,571
If I don't, there's no way I can
show my sorry face to Mayaka tomorrow.

18
00:02:21,667 --> 00:02:24,934
I will chain him to a wall and read
every last word of this book to him.

218
00:12:22,452 --> 00:12:25,678
In other words, the culprit is still
lurking around on the fourth floor.

95
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:34,038
I guess that's what it looks like to
put your whole heart into a project.

191
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:30,899
I ran into her coming down the stairs,
so we came up and looked together.

257
00:14:00,335 --> 00:14:04,123
Man, nobody here got any Valentine's
sweets. You don't have to rub it in!

100
00:06:44,818 --> 00:06:47,740
I think she's just going to have to
leave it in the clubroom or something.

178
00:10:52,934 --> 00:10:56,400
It was sitting right there on the
table when I left to go look for Fukube.

309
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:34,295
I will find that chocolate even if I
have to resort to desperate measures.

433
00:23:21,571 --> 00:23:25,114
I am the one who blew everything way
out of proportion in the first place.

166
00:10:23,952 --> 00:10:27,131
It doesn't look like we can use the
west stairs to get to the fourth floor.

189
00:11:22,143 --> 00:11:25,910
Fukube and I have scoured every corner
in here and all around the building.

386
00:21:11,167 --> 00:21:14,542
Caring so much about the prize took
the joy out of it, even when I did win.

16
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:19,792
I'll just have to make the best dang
homemade chocolate anyone has ever had,

176
00:10:47,276 --> 00:10:51,419
Heart-shaped, wrapped in plastic, and
about this big, or maybe a bit bigger.

222
00:12:35,079 --> 00:12:38,717
Other than us, the Astronomy Club is
the only one that hasn't gone home yet.

358
00:19:47,823 --> 00:19:51,558
You invented that story about the
Spider Society so I could escape Chitanda.

374
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:43,083
People like that will actually apply
themselves and not let others beat them

435
00:23:26,489 --> 00:23:30,088
That means when Oreki said that the
girl from the Astronomy Club stole it...

26
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:41,847
There is. Do you know of any stores
nearby that sell fancy baking ingredients?

82
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:54,263
"This chocolate is a gift for you from
your devoted older sister, Tomoe Oreki,

220
00:12:29,491 --> 00:12:33,409
The Classic Lit Club, Light Music Club,
Astronomy Club, and the Philosophy Club.

318
00:17:05,486 --> 00:17:09,252
There are a few things I need to check
out, and I can't do that with you around.

407
00:22:10,577 --> 00:22:14,367
Besides, if I let go of my new philosophy
and give in to my feelings for Mayaka,

443
00:23:42,708 --> 00:23:47,098
But not as appalling as me still liking
Fuku after everything he has done to me!

3
00:00:07,233 --> 00:00:11,562
You mean this chocolate, poured into a
form, cooled and hardened, isn't homemade.

108
00:07:05,033 --> 00:07:08,264
we don't traditionally give anyone gifts
at the end of the year or in the summer,

28
00:02:43,365 --> 00:02:47,433
There is a store by the market that sells
culinary supplies for professional chefs.

42
00:03:09,566 --> 00:03:13,610
I won't say a word. And I'd appreciate it
if you'd stop giving me that devil glare.

413
00:22:29,517 --> 00:22:33,460
This was the only way I could try to avoid
accepting a gift that I couldn't receive.

381
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:00,106
You sensed something had changed at the
arcade, right? I wasn't the way I used to be?

60
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:31,851
And if that didn't work, he was an awfully
sore loser who would throw tantrums and pout.

186
00:11:15,444 --> 00:11:19,648
Call me a coward, but I can't bring myself
to until I've done all that I can to find it.

384
00:21:04,437 --> 00:21:08,988
The old me wanted to win just for the sake
of glory, and I was a lot fussier in general.

58
00:04:11,095 --> 00:04:15,430
Satoshi's gaming strategy when we were in
middle school was to keep his eye on the prize.

347
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:07,907
Satoshi probably waited in the boy's restroom
on the third floor for Chitanda to pass by.

162
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:10,543
The last thing I wanted was to be around when
Ibara got the news that her chocolate was gone.

181
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:04,639
I should have locked the door, but I knew that
I was only going to be gone for a few minutes.

239
00:13:15,257 --> 00:13:19,375
It's just that someone stole Valentine's
chocolate from our clubroom, and we only came to ask

397
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:44,080
and the fact that she likes me and wants to be
with me is nothing short of a dream come true.

275
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:50,527
Unless you count climbing the outside walls,
just the stairs that were closed and being waxed,

205
00:11:55,582 --> 00:12:00,041
What kind of culprit lingers near the scene of
the crime, casually hanging up a poster like that?

350
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:17,792
It wouldn't fit in his bag in one piece, and
there wasn't a large enough bag anywhere in the room.

198
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:44,523
Well, he was already on the stairs messing with
that thing when I left the room to look for Fukube.

12
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:34,338
I'm going to shove a masterpiece into your face
that's so amazing even you won't be able to turn it down!

200
00:11:45,245 --> 00:11:50,299
If the Industrial Arts kid was on the stairs the whole
time you were gone, he would have seen who came and left.
