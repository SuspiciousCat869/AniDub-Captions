1
00:00:06,965 --> 00:00:09,792
They say high school is all sunshine and roses.

2
00:00:09,911 --> 00:00:13,207
Sunshine, roses, rainbows, and unicorns.

3
00:00:13,411 --> 00:00:16,765
I've heard so much about the bliss and
excitement of being a high school student

4
00:00:16,852 --> 00:00:19,156
that I've written it off as a worn out cliché.

5
00:00:19,594 --> 00:00:24,264
Who's to say that all teenagers even want high
school to be like some fairy tale fever dream?

6
00:00:24,594 --> 00:00:26,036
It seems ridiculous to me.

7
00:00:26,458 --> 00:00:27,943
There's all the studying,

8
00:00:27,983 --> 00:00:29,635
and the sports hysteria,

9
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:32,345
and the saccharin-sweet romantic affairs.

10
00:00:32,494 --> 00:00:33,786
Those are the worst.

11
00:00:35,364 --> 00:00:38,740
A lot of teenagers have no interest
in that kind of nonsense, right?

12
00:00:40,061 --> 00:00:40,607
Well...

13
00:00:41,097 --> 00:00:44,667
I guess when you rule out all that
crap, there's not much left over, is there?

14
00:00:44,819 --> 00:00:48,273
Wow, Hotaro, I never knew you
were such a full-fledged pessimist.

15
00:00:48,386 --> 00:00:49,648
Wait, a pessimist?

16
00:00:49,911 --> 00:00:53,369
Why have you got a problem with studying, sports, romance?

17
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:55,202
Things the normal kids enjoy.

18
00:00:55,369 --> 00:00:57,085
You make it sound so dismal.

19
00:00:57,345 --> 00:00:58,553
That's not what I said.

20
00:00:58,578 --> 00:00:59,619
You misunderstood me.

21
00:00:59,703 --> 00:01:01,009
I'm telling you what I hear.

22
00:01:01,344 --> 00:01:02,510
Maybe you're just lazy.

23
00:01:02,578 --> 00:01:03,862
What do you think of that?

24
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:10,193
Anytime you think something's a hassle or seems
like it might be frivolous, you refuse to do it!

25
00:01:10,328 --> 00:01:12,639
Which explains... your motto!

26
00:01:14,257 --> 00:01:16,507
"If I don't have to, I'm not going to.

27
00:01:16,703 --> 00:01:19,286
And if I have to, I'll do it as quickly as possible."

28
00:01:19,369 --> 00:01:20,457
That's the one.

29
00:01:20,786 --> 00:01:22,197
But just so you know,

30
00:01:22,369 --> 00:01:27,411
by not joining any of the offerings at the
veritable Mecca of clubs which we call Kamiyama High,

31
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:30,214
you've made a little black cloud appear above your head.

32
00:01:30,422 --> 00:01:33,608
You might think you're slick,
but you're only punishing yourself.

33
00:01:33,654 --> 00:01:36,040
You've crossed over into downright masochism.

34
00:01:36,135 --> 00:01:37,749
You sure like to run your mouth.

35
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:39,234
You're just now noticing?

36
00:01:39,313 --> 00:01:40,958
We've been friends since middle school.

37
00:01:41,786 --> 00:01:43,507
Whatever. Go without me.

38
00:01:43,693 --> 00:01:45,684
What do you mean, "without you"?

39
00:01:48,807 --> 00:01:49,577
What the...?!

40
00:01:49,855 --> 00:01:52,541
Is that what I think it is? A club application?

41
00:01:52,604 --> 00:01:55,234
Hotaro! You're joining one? Classic Lit club? Really?

42
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:56,208
Oh, you know it?

43
00:01:56,232 --> 00:01:57,245
Of course I do!

44
00:01:57,753 --> 00:01:59,762
Since when are you into classic lit?

45
00:02:01,725 --> 00:02:02,639
What's that?

46
00:02:02,919 --> 00:02:05,007
What does a letter from your sister have to do with it?

47
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:06,668
She sent it to me from India.

48
00:02:06,842 --> 00:02:09,163
Some place in the north called Varanasi.

49
00:02:09,425 --> 00:02:10,401
Oh, yeah?

50
00:02:11,292 --> 00:02:12,928
I see what's going on.

51
00:02:13,142 --> 00:02:14,430
Your sister's blackmailing you.

52
00:02:14,699 --> 00:02:17,210
They're threatening to shut it down for lack of members.

53
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,856
She wants me to join and help keep the club alive.

54
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:22,191
But I thought your sister was more into martial arts.

55
00:02:22,216 --> 00:02:24,153
Aikido, actually, which is worse.

56
00:02:24,178 --> 00:02:26,314
If she wants to hurt you, she knows just how to do it.

57
00:02:27,052 --> 00:02:28,634
Then you should do what she says!

58
00:02:28,659 --> 00:02:30,851
Well, it's not like I have anything better to do,

59
00:02:30,954 --> 00:02:32,894
and believe me, I've tried to think of an excuse.

60
00:02:32,973 --> 00:02:35,007
So the club doesn't have any members?

61
00:02:35,063 --> 00:02:35,515
Nope.

62
00:02:35,771 --> 00:02:39,002
Well, then look on the bright side:
You'll have the clubroom all to yourself!

63
00:02:39,137 --> 00:02:42,269
It'll be nice to have your own private
space on school grounds, at least.

64
00:02:42,316 --> 00:02:43,374
Sounds like a dream!

65
00:02:43,533 --> 00:02:44,439
"My own private space?"

66
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,855
Come on, ladies!

67
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:48,863
I salute people who have that kind of energy.

68
00:02:49,894 --> 00:02:50,484
Knock, knock.

69
00:02:50,509 --> 00:02:52,898
People usually misunderstand me on this.

70
00:02:53,128 --> 00:02:57,180
It's not like I think my way of doing
things is better than theirs, by any means.

71
00:02:57,672 --> 00:03:01,146
And I don't see myself as superior
to those who choose to get involved.

72
00:03:01,534 --> 00:03:03,536
I'm just true to my motto, that's all.

73
00:03:04,673 --> 00:03:06,881
If I don't have to, I'm not going to.

74
00:03:07,095 --> 00:03:09,916
And if I have to, I'll do it as quickly as possible.

75
00:03:12,616 --> 00:03:13,605
There, see?

76
00:03:13,942 --> 00:03:15,167
Ew!

77
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:23,573
Fourth floor of the auxiliary building.

78
00:03:24,025 --> 00:03:25,821
That's as remote as it gets.

79
00:05:53,749 --> 00:05:54,659
Hello, there.

80
00:05:56,408 --> 00:05:58,847
I didn't know you were in the Classic Literature club.

81
00:05:59,085 --> 00:06:00,236
Oreki, right?

82
00:06:02,334 --> 00:06:03,126
Who're you?

83
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,622
Oh, you don't know?

84
00:06:05,066 --> 00:06:08,183
My name's Eru. Eru Chitanda.

85
00:06:08,365 --> 00:06:10,764
Sorry. I have no idea who you are.

86
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:13,092
Hotaro Oreki from class 1-B?

87
00:06:13,187 --> 00:06:14,419
That is your name, isn't it?

88
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:15,086
Yeah.

89
00:06:15,467 --> 00:06:17,797
I'm in class 1-A, so we have met.

90
00:06:17,923 --> 00:06:18,868
I'm sorry, but...

91
00:06:18,893 --> 00:06:20,648
That's not ringing any bells, so...

92
00:06:21,428 --> 00:06:24,343
1-A? Maybe we share an elective.

93
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:27,386
Wait a sec, you wouldn't happen
to be in my music class, would you?

94
00:06:27,473 --> 00:06:28,132
Yep!

95
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:31,009
We've only had that class once so far this term.

96
00:06:31,239 --> 00:06:33,114
Her memory is incredible.

97
00:06:33,774 --> 00:06:35,251
So, uh, Chitanda...

98
00:06:35,418 --> 00:06:36,646
What are you doing in here?

99
00:06:36,913 --> 00:06:38,335
Are you lost or something?

100
00:06:38,509 --> 00:06:38,946
Nope!

101
00:06:42,616 --> 00:06:44,858
You see, I joined the Classic Lit club.

102
00:06:44,985 --> 00:06:46,805
This is where it says we're supposed to meet!

103
00:06:46,868 --> 00:06:48,562
I joined the Classic Lit club.

104
00:06:48,736 --> 00:06:50,355
I joined the Classic Lit club.

105
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:52,063
Are you for real?

106
00:06:52,468 --> 00:06:53,993
Why would you do that?

107
00:06:56,243 --> 00:06:59,022
I have my reasons, but they're kind of personal.

108
00:06:59,649 --> 00:07:00,722
Why did you join?

109
00:07:00,912 --> 00:07:01,557
Oh, uh...

110
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:04,029
No reason really, I'm just glad we have members.

111
00:07:04,275 --> 00:07:05,642
Are you happy now, Sis?

112
00:07:05,864 --> 00:07:08,239
Classic Lit club lives to see another day.

113
00:07:08,477 --> 00:07:09,685
Well, see ya later.

114
00:07:09,978 --> 00:07:11,440
Wait, you're leaving already?

115
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:13,340
Sure am. Have fun in here.

116
00:07:13,531 --> 00:07:15,057
And be sure to lock up when you leave.

117
00:07:15,104 --> 00:07:15,588
What?

118
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,965
I can't lock up if I don't have a key.

119
00:07:20,705 --> 00:07:21,438
What's that?

120
00:07:21,521 --> 00:07:23,263
I was saying that I don't have a key.

121
00:07:23,327 --> 00:07:23,978
Oh, yeah.

122
00:07:24,622 --> 00:07:25,289
Here.

123
00:07:25,877 --> 00:07:26,705
Wait a sec...

124
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:28,738
Why do you have the key to this room, Oreki?

125
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:30,009
What do you mean by that?

126
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:33,735
How in the hell was I supposed to
get into a locked classroom without one?

127
00:07:34,235 --> 00:07:36,316
Pardon my French. I'm confused.

128
00:07:36,569 --> 00:07:39,057
I don't understand how you got in before I showed up.

129
00:07:39,152 --> 00:07:40,971
The door was open when I got here.

130
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:43,720
Well, then you must have just locked it behind you.

131
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:48,346
Are you saying what I think? I was locked in here?

132
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:49,283
Yeah, you were.

133
00:07:49,394 --> 00:07:52,875
So someone came along and trapped me
alone in this room until you showed up?

134
00:07:52,915 --> 00:07:54,591
Look, I'm sure you just did it yourself.

135
00:07:54,686 --> 00:07:55,830
Are you certain that you didn't?

136
00:07:55,926 --> 00:07:57,602
Yes, I'm absolutely certain!

137
00:07:57,705 --> 00:07:59,358
But I'm the only one with a key.

138
00:07:59,493 --> 00:08:01,642
I mean what else could have possibly happened here?

139
00:08:01,828 --> 00:08:04,242
Maybe we should ask the guy who's hiding in the hallway.

140
00:08:04,267 --> 00:08:04,847
Huh?

141
00:08:06,245 --> 00:08:07,358
Satoshi...

142
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:09,860
Hey! Sorry about that.

143
00:08:09,976 --> 00:08:12,201
I totally didn't mean to eavesdrop on you guys.

144
00:08:12,226 --> 00:08:13,342
You "totally" did.

145
00:08:13,382 --> 00:08:15,133
Okay, guilty as charged.

146
00:08:15,158 --> 00:08:17,972
But I gotta admit, when I see my good buddy, Hotaro,

147
00:08:18,067 --> 00:08:22,674
known for his stoicism, in an empty classroom
with a young lady, and dusk fast approaching,

148
00:08:22,761 --> 00:08:24,431
I get more than a little curious.

149
00:08:24,494 --> 00:08:26,948
I had no intention of barging in...

150
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:27,528
Hey!

151
00:08:27,949 --> 00:08:30,005
We weren't... No! I wasn't...!

152
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:31,333
You've gotta be kidding me.

153
00:08:31,421 --> 00:08:33,230
Of course. Just joking.

154
00:08:33,603 --> 00:08:34,892
Oh, thank goodness.

155
00:08:34,977 --> 00:08:37,464
Sorry 'bout that. This guy has no manners at all.

156
00:08:37,536 --> 00:08:39,061
Nothing beats a good joke!

157
00:08:39,172 --> 00:08:41,253
"Don't ever take life too seriously."

158
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:43,078
I live by that motto.

159
00:08:43,275 --> 00:08:44,166
Right.

160
00:08:44,943 --> 00:08:46,509
Oreki, who is this boy?

161
00:08:46,597 --> 00:08:50,196
This is Satoshi Fukube, would be comedian.

162
00:08:50,489 --> 00:08:51,048
I see.

163
00:08:51,101 --> 00:08:52,080
Hey, good one!

164
00:08:52,105 --> 00:08:53,852
I'm honored that you think so, my good friend.

165
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:56,402
Nice to meet you. And you are...?

166
00:08:56,473 --> 00:08:57,767
I'm Eru Chitanda.

167
00:08:57,863 --> 00:08:59,351
Did you say Chitanda?

168
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:01,717
As in the very famous Chitandas?

169
00:09:01,876 --> 00:09:03,101
What's the matter with you?

170
00:09:03,219 --> 00:09:06,351
Wait, are you telling me you've
never heard of the Chitanda family?

171
00:09:06,476 --> 00:09:09,392
Kamiyama has more than a few prestigious dynasties.

172
00:09:09,574 --> 00:09:12,856
But none of them are as notable
as the four Higher Power Families.

173
00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:15,247
There's the shrine-owning Jumonji family,

174
00:09:15,366 --> 00:09:17,091
the Sasusuberi Bookstore Tycoons,

175
00:09:17,155 --> 00:09:20,356
the wealthy Chitanda farmers,
and the Maninbashi landowners.

176
00:09:20,483 --> 00:09:24,409
Written this way, the kanji for each name
increases by the power of ten, hence the name

177
00:09:24,448 --> 00:09:25,560
"Higher Power Families."

178
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:26,600
Is that true?

179
00:09:26,851 --> 00:09:28,944
I wouldn't say we're a prestigious family.

180
00:09:29,016 --> 00:09:31,559
And I've never heard us referred to by that name before.

181
00:09:31,678 --> 00:09:32,735
You made up the name.

182
00:09:32,846 --> 00:09:35,674
It sounds cool, and I thought I
could be the one to coin the phrase.

183
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:37,851
They really increase by powers of ten, huh?

184
00:09:38,057 --> 00:09:40,517
Don't act so impressed. He'll get a big ego.

185
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:44,559
They also say the oldest Chitanda girl is
known for her beauty and incredible grades.

186
00:09:44,604 --> 00:09:47,249
And that she's the most refined girl in all of Kamiyama.

187
00:09:47,345 --> 00:09:52,048
In middle school, she got a perfect score on the
prefectural exams, and the school board went crazy!

188
00:09:52,151 --> 00:09:53,557
No way. Is he right?

189
00:09:53,653 --> 00:09:54,684
It's just a fluke.

190
00:09:54,972 --> 00:09:57,234
I have a knack for acing standardized tests.

191
00:09:57,259 --> 00:09:58,403
Well, I beg your pardon.

192
00:09:58,697 --> 00:10:01,033
Anyway, I happened to hear you guys talking.

193
00:10:01,112 --> 00:10:03,621
Wow, what a mystery, am I right? I'm not following.

194
00:10:03,788 --> 00:10:07,085
How in the heck did Chitanda get
locked inside this room earlier?

195
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,364
Oh, I forgot!

196
00:10:10,017 --> 00:10:13,402
When I showed up, the door to this
room was most definitely unlocked.

197
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,517
But when Oreki got here, it was bolted, and he
had to use his key to get inside, so what happened?

198
00:10:18,749 --> 00:10:19,741
Well, that's easy.

199
00:10:19,901 --> 00:10:21,999
You must have locked it when you came in and forgotten.

200
00:10:22,103 --> 00:10:22,904
Try again!

201
00:10:22,929 --> 00:10:27,289
Kami High School's doors can only be locked
using a key, from the inside or the outside.

202
00:10:27,638 --> 00:10:31,016
So that means it's not even possible
for Chitanda to have locked herself in!

203
00:10:31,533 --> 00:10:32,684
That's crazy!

204
00:10:32,828 --> 00:10:35,101
Man, you've always been such a know-it-all.

205
00:10:35,338 --> 00:10:37,833
I prefer the term "database," sir.

206
00:10:38,309 --> 00:10:41,781
Well, I'm sure there's a reasonable
explanation for this whole lock thing.

207
00:10:41,853 --> 00:10:42,941
See you guys later.

208
00:10:43,736 --> 00:10:45,349
No, please don't go just yet!

209
00:10:45,476 --> 00:10:46,309
Why not?

210
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:52,745
I have to know. How did I come to
be locked in this room like that?

211
00:10:52,864 --> 00:10:56,297
And if the door was supposed to be
locked, why was it open when I got here?

212
00:10:56,472 --> 00:10:58,341
Did someone leave it open on purpose?

213
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,726
And if they did, why?

214
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,463
If not, how did they lock it again without me noticing?

215
00:11:02,598 --> 00:11:05,378
I beg you, Oreki, think about it carefully.

216
00:11:05,984 --> 00:11:07,466
I need your help.

217
00:11:13,409 --> 00:11:15,553
Please. I have to know!

218
00:11:21,657 --> 00:11:24,865
Yeah. Okay. I'll help.

219
00:11:25,788 --> 00:11:27,871
It is interesting, after all.

220
00:11:28,942 --> 00:11:30,523
Thank you so very much!

221
00:11:30,587 --> 00:11:32,934
So do you have any ideas, just off the top of your head?

222
00:11:33,058 --> 00:11:35,186
Whoa, Chitanda. Give him some time.

223
00:11:35,464 --> 00:11:38,707
While I'm full of useless information
and can't make any deductions,

224
00:11:38,834 --> 00:11:40,098
Hotaro is the opposite.

225
00:11:40,331 --> 00:11:41,697
Once he's had some time to think,

226
00:11:41,722 --> 00:11:43,826
his conclusions are fairly accurate.

227
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:45,026
That's enough.

228
00:11:45,509 --> 00:11:46,391
Let's see.

229
00:11:49,482 --> 00:11:51,452
So how long were you here before me?

230
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:54,239
It couldn't have more than about three minutes.

231
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:58,442
Did you notice anything unusual?

232
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:00,101
Well, actually...

233
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:03,476
I've been hearing this weird
rattling below us this whole time.

234
00:12:03,621 --> 00:12:05,219
What? I don't hear anything.

235
00:12:05,274 --> 00:12:07,095
It's really faint. Listen.

236
00:12:07,322 --> 00:12:09,281
You must have really sharp ears.

237
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:15,607
So... Have you figured anything out yet?

238
00:12:15,662 --> 00:12:16,368
Maybe.

239
00:12:16,876 --> 00:12:19,546
I bet the culprit is on the floor below us right now.

240
00:12:36,074 --> 00:12:38,390
Last one. Good.

241
00:12:40,473 --> 00:12:41,490
A-ha.

242
00:12:41,577 --> 00:12:44,494
Chitanda must have gone into the room
while the maintenance guy was working,

243
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:47,377
and accidentally gotten locked inside without knowing it.

244
00:12:47,734 --> 00:12:50,142
I have the regular key to the science room in my pocket.

245
00:12:50,315 --> 00:12:52,017
I know the janitor has a master,

246
00:12:52,101 --> 00:12:53,976
and they don't give those out to students.

247
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:56,163
That's how you knew he was working.

248
00:12:56,678 --> 00:12:59,285
But still... You guessed that just from a noise!

249
00:13:00,755 --> 00:13:01,755
Yeah, I did.

250
00:13:02,056 --> 00:13:06,055
Anyway, I still don't understand why you didn't
notice the sound of the door locking when you were inside

251
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:09,059
the science room, if you could
hear the janitor through the floor.

252
00:13:09,213 --> 00:13:11,437
Ah. A simple explanation.

253
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:16,267
I was distracted by that old building.

254
00:13:16,452 --> 00:13:17,485
It's ancient!

255
00:13:17,628 --> 00:13:18,057
Yep.

256
00:13:18,485 --> 00:13:19,309
Is it really?

257
00:13:19,501 --> 00:13:21,154
Yeah. Look at it!

258
00:13:25,707 --> 00:13:28,171
By the way, I think we should talk about the club.

259
00:13:28,211 --> 00:13:29,142
Oh, that's right.

260
00:13:29,284 --> 00:13:29,877
Yeah.

261
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:33,429
From the look of things, I'd say
it's only going to be the three of us.

262
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:34,730
"Three of us?"

263
00:13:34,978 --> 00:13:37,138
Fukube, what do you think? Wanna join?

264
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:39,814
Why not? I sure had a lot of fun today.

265
00:13:40,409 --> 00:13:43,708
I'll have to juggle Executive
Committee and handicrafts, but uh...

266
00:13:43,909 --> 00:13:45,169
Yep! I'm in!

267
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:47,497
Hotaro is in, too.

268
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,443
He's already filled out the application.

269
00:13:49,779 --> 00:13:51,087
Have you really?

270
00:13:51,699 --> 00:13:52,906
Huh? Yeah, I filled it out.

271
00:13:53,781 --> 00:13:54,352
Great.

272
00:14:04,508 --> 00:14:05,142
Huh?

273
00:14:05,226 --> 00:14:06,723
Right! I'll turn this in!

274
00:14:07,223 --> 00:14:09,560
I'm really looking forward to seeing you again.

275
00:14:09,687 --> 00:14:10,926
Yeah, same here!

276
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:12,926
And Hotaro is, too.

277
00:14:14,779 --> 00:14:17,163
I guess we're gonna have to choose a club president!

278
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,601
Who should we pick?

279
00:14:18,895 --> 00:14:20,510
Huh, good question.

280
00:14:20,637 --> 00:14:22,378
I don't think Hotaro would be the best candidate.

281
00:14:22,434 --> 00:14:23,878
Well, there you have it, Sis.

282
00:14:23,965 --> 00:14:27,309
Your precious Classic Literature
Club lives to see another term.

283
00:14:27,469 --> 00:14:30,211
As a result, my dreams of conserving energy are dead.

284
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,865
No! I'm not gonna lay them to rest without a fight.

285
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:35,267
I refuse to give up my peace of mind that easily.

286
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:38,234
I will devote all my efforts
to doing as little as possible.

287
00:14:38,695 --> 00:14:40,059
There's just one problem.

288
00:14:40,219 --> 00:14:42,562
...and the tranquil temperament of a great leader!

289
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,463
That little lady.

290
00:14:51,947 --> 00:14:53,972
It happened yesterday after school.

291
00:14:54,234 --> 00:14:57,434
A first year girl climbed to the
fourth floor of the auxiliary building.

292
00:14:57,595 --> 00:15:01,767
When she arrived, she heard the somber strains
of "Moonlight Sonata" coming from the music room.

293
00:15:01,932 --> 00:15:04,767
The setting sun bathed the hallway in a crimson glow.

294
00:15:04,851 --> 00:15:05,934
The warm tones...

295
00:15:05,961 --> 00:15:07,684
Objection. It rained all day.

296
00:15:07,748 --> 00:15:08,992
You couldn't see the sunset.

297
00:15:09,017 --> 00:15:09,662
Fine.

298
00:15:09,805 --> 00:15:11,870
It was a dark and gloomy afternoon,

299
00:15:11,895 --> 00:15:13,523
and dusk was drawing near.

300
00:15:13,626 --> 00:15:17,476
A feeling of unease clung to the girl,
and the rain on her skin made her shiver.

301
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:18,752
You're embellishing.

302
00:15:18,824 --> 00:15:21,517
Lured by the mysterious tones, she entered the room.

303
00:15:21,722 --> 00:15:23,517
Immediately, the music stopped.

304
00:15:23,601 --> 00:15:26,951
The lid of the piano was up,
but no one was seated at the keys.

305
00:15:26,976 --> 00:15:29,957
The drawn curtains and gloomy
weather made the room darker than usual.

306
00:15:30,059 --> 00:15:31,471
That's when she saw her!

307
00:15:31,836 --> 00:15:36,684
A female student with long, messy hair hanging
over her face, was slumped over across the room!

308
00:15:36,865 --> 00:15:41,752
Her eyes were so bloodshot they almost glowed. As
the apparition stared menacingly at our heroine...

309
00:15:43,267 --> 00:15:47,767
It was the ghost of a piano club member of the
past, who had met a tragic end in that very room,

310
00:15:47,871 --> 00:15:50,326
minutes before a national competition!

311
00:15:50,409 --> 00:15:51,282
Oh, really?

312
00:15:51,392 --> 00:15:53,501
Huh? Well...

313
00:15:53,589 --> 00:15:56,506
I don't know about that part
for sure, but it's not impossible.

314
00:15:56,531 --> 00:15:57,738
Yeah, that's what I thought.

315
00:15:57,842 --> 00:15:59,767
I've gotta say, this is a surprise.

316
00:15:59,956 --> 00:16:02,726
I don't think you've ever forgotten your
homework in all the years I've known you.

317
00:16:02,927 --> 00:16:04,348
I didn't forget to do it.

318
00:16:04,617 --> 00:16:06,525
I just left it at home this morning, that's all.

319
00:16:06,636 --> 00:16:11,278
So now I have to stay after class and write the
same stupid essay again, while you talk my ear off.

320
00:16:11,365 --> 00:16:12,453
Yeah, lucky you.

321
00:16:13,035 --> 00:16:16,418
Anyway, I heard there really was a
crazy-haired ghost in the music room.

322
00:16:16,552 --> 00:16:19,588
That's all anyone in class A
could talk about during lunch today.

323
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:22,684
The real question is how quickly the story
will spread through the rest of the school.

324
00:16:22,767 --> 00:16:23,996
And if it will change at all.

325
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:26,554
It's one of the seven wonders of Kamiyama High School.

326
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,334
Number two! You know?

327
00:16:28,929 --> 00:16:32,649
I'm interested to see how many days it
takes the news to spread to D, my class.

328
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,087
Hold on a second.

329
00:16:35,229 --> 00:16:38,409
Exactly when, where, and from
whom did you hear this story?

330
00:16:38,621 --> 00:16:41,212
Earlier today, in the club room, from Chitanda.

331
00:16:43,996 --> 00:16:47,532
If the music room ghost is the second
of the seven wonders, what's the first?

332
00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:49,467
I'm sure you're dying to tell me.

333
00:16:56,738 --> 00:16:59,694
Hey! I suspected I might find you two in here.

334
00:17:00,868 --> 00:17:02,641
I wrote it up for you. Here ya go.

335
00:17:02,792 --> 00:17:04,351
Thanks, I appreciate that.

336
00:17:04,434 --> 00:17:05,357
I'm sorry.

337
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:07,454
As a member of the Executive Committee,

338
00:17:07,479 --> 00:17:10,278
I'm forced to delegate some of
my responsibilities to others.

339
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:11,226
No worries!

340
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,294
After all, I am the club president now.

341
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:16,443
Hi, Oreki!

342
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:17,538
You came at the perfect time!

343
00:17:18,164 --> 00:17:21,058
Satoshi just finished telling
me quite an interesting story.

344
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:22,641
Yeah! I'm glad you brought that up!

345
00:17:22,704 --> 00:17:23,406
I heard it at lunch!

346
00:17:23,431 --> 00:17:26,492
It's about the mysterious Secret Club Recruitment Notes.

347
00:17:26,517 --> 00:17:27,226
Have you heard it?

348
00:17:27,309 --> 00:17:28,691
A secret club?

349
00:17:28,962 --> 00:17:30,878
Yes, why don't you tell her the story, Satoshi?

350
00:17:30,903 --> 00:17:31,387
Huh?

351
00:17:32,857 --> 00:17:34,565
Well, what do you say? Wanna hear it?

352
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:36,257
Honestly, it's pretty fascinating.

353
00:17:36,543 --> 00:17:37,273
Yes.

354
00:17:37,575 --> 00:17:38,122
Ahem.

355
00:17:38,862 --> 00:17:41,226
I heard it today at the Executive Committee meeting.

356
00:17:41,461 --> 00:17:44,194
Well, you already know this school has a million clubs.

357
00:17:44,234 --> 00:17:47,667
So of course there are recruitment
posters plastered all over the place.

358
00:17:47,794 --> 00:17:50,559
There are so many that the bulletin
boards get buried underneath them.

359
00:17:50,749 --> 00:17:54,292
When the Executive Committee finds
unauthorized posts, we take them down.

360
00:17:54,317 --> 00:17:55,406
No exceptions.

361
00:17:55,659 --> 00:17:56,731
However...

362
00:17:56,834 --> 00:18:00,071
For the past few years, a strange
recruitment note has been turning up,

363
00:18:00,096 --> 00:18:02,364
and no one claims to know a thing about it.

364
00:18:02,482 --> 00:18:07,225
Last year, it showed up as a scrap of notebook
paper with just a meeting place and time scribbled on it.

365
00:18:07,435 --> 00:18:11,413
This club has been gathering, conducting
secret business, and recruiting new members,

366
00:18:11,453 --> 00:18:13,653
all without the Executive Committee's knowledge.

367
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:18,612
No one knows for sure who they are or what
they do, but we do have one piece of information:

368
00:18:18,659 --> 00:18:19,399
Their name.

369
00:18:19,494 --> 00:18:20,521
Yeah, what is it?

370
00:18:20,546 --> 00:18:22,131
Joro Spider Society.

371
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:23,901
Joro Spider?

372
00:18:24,234 --> 00:18:27,062
So you know Tanabe, the chair of the Executive Committee?

373
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:31,823
Well, he tried to bust them up last year by going to
the alleged meeting place at the exact time the note said.

374
00:18:32,017 --> 00:18:33,991
That plan didn't go over so well.

375
00:18:34,197 --> 00:18:38,017
He didn't find anything and decided it
was a hoax to make the committee look stupid.

376
00:18:38,218 --> 00:18:38,884
However...

377
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:39,752
What happened?

378
00:18:39,815 --> 00:18:43,684
On graduation day, one of the departing
students pulled him aside and said...

379
00:18:44,557 --> 00:18:47,440
"I was the president of the Joro Spider Society.

380
00:18:47,642 --> 00:18:50,601
Please give my warm regards to the one who succeeds me.

381
00:18:50,684 --> 00:18:52,142
Which will be hard,

382
00:18:52,246 --> 00:18:55,305
because we will ensure that
you never unveil his identity."

383
00:18:57,476 --> 00:19:00,351
They're likely recruiting new members for this year, too.

384
00:19:00,434 --> 00:19:02,821
But we haven't been able to find their secret base yet.

385
00:19:03,735 --> 00:19:07,581
The cryptic recruitment note of Joro Spider Society!

386
00:19:07,934 --> 00:19:09,805
That's it. I must know!

387
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:10,649
Yes!

388
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,436
I had a feeling you'd say that.

389
00:19:12,492 --> 00:19:14,795
Which is why I said you came at the perfect time.

390
00:19:15,019 --> 00:19:16,416
And what do you mean by that?

391
00:19:16,441 --> 00:19:17,958
You're just in time for the next step:

392
00:19:18,045 --> 00:19:19,144
To find the note.

393
00:19:20,558 --> 00:19:21,167
Right!

394
00:19:22,614 --> 00:19:25,226
There's a total of 30 bulletin
boards throughout the school.

395
00:19:25,427 --> 00:19:26,347
That many?

396
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:27,976
Are we going to search all of them?

397
00:19:28,016 --> 00:19:28,892
No, we're not.

398
00:19:28,976 --> 00:19:31,907
It's faster to just search the boards
where they're most likely to hide the note.

399
00:19:32,003 --> 00:19:33,125
That makes sense.

400
00:19:33,269 --> 00:19:35,239
Where would you put a secret recruitment note?

401
00:19:35,319 --> 00:19:36,709
Well, if it were up to me...

402
00:19:36,876 --> 00:19:41,333
I think I'd pin it to one of the corner bulletin boards,
where it would attract as little attention as possible.

403
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,693
That's where you're wrong, though.

404
00:19:42,757 --> 00:19:43,853
Wait, why is that?

405
00:19:43,965 --> 00:19:46,843
Remember that the purpose of
this note is to recruit new members,

406
00:19:46,868 --> 00:19:49,704
so they'd probably put it on the
board at the first floor entrance.

407
00:19:49,729 --> 00:19:50,223
What?

408
00:19:50,248 --> 00:19:52,226
But everyone in school would see it, wouldn't they?

409
00:19:52,448 --> 00:19:53,916
Hold on, Chitanda.

410
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:56,650
I'm sure Hotaro has a brilliant idea up his sleeve.

411
00:20:00,463 --> 00:20:01,130
Wow!

412
00:20:01,155 --> 00:20:03,476
It's pretty impressive that
our school has all these clubs!

413
00:20:03,551 --> 00:20:04,718
Kinda hard to believe.

414
00:20:04,743 --> 00:20:06,184
It is remarkable.

415
00:20:06,267 --> 00:20:09,457
A calligraphy club, a basketball club, a track club.

416
00:20:09,505 --> 00:20:11,206
The list just keeps going.

417
00:20:11,809 --> 00:20:14,628
There's barely any open space left on the board.

418
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:17,099
Hey, Oreki.

419
00:20:17,218 --> 00:20:18,315
Are you doing okay?

420
00:20:18,418 --> 00:20:18,848
Yeah.

421
00:20:19,103 --> 00:20:21,932
I'm just a little overwhelmed
by all this activity, I guess.

422
00:20:22,686 --> 00:20:25,892
This world must be unfathomable to
our energy-conserving friend here.

423
00:20:26,086 --> 00:20:29,232
Anyway, since this is the first
bulletin board the students see,

424
00:20:29,391 --> 00:20:30,964
it's become a battleground.

425
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:32,894
Wait, what does that mean?

426
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,411
Oh, right, I get it!

427
00:20:34,515 --> 00:20:38,537
With so many clubs competing to get noticed,
an unauthorized post could slip under the radar.

428
00:20:38,585 --> 00:20:39,497
That's part of it.

429
00:20:40,059 --> 00:20:40,926
"Part of it"?

430
00:20:40,999 --> 00:20:42,929
Wait, what could some other reasons be?

431
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:43,976
You'll see.

432
00:20:44,142 --> 00:20:45,809
Let's just start looking around, okay?

433
00:20:46,018 --> 00:20:46,621
Right!

434
00:20:46,964 --> 00:20:49,634
There's the Environmental Club, Debate Club,

435
00:20:49,659 --> 00:20:51,518
even a Hundred Poets Card Game Club.

436
00:20:52,424 --> 00:20:53,759
The Fortune-telling Club!

437
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:56,237
I have a good friend who just joined that one this year.

438
00:20:56,269 --> 00:20:57,103
Oh, yeah?

439
00:20:57,468 --> 00:20:59,495
Koto Club. Ping Pong Club.

440
00:20:59,686 --> 00:21:00,639
The Art Club.

441
00:21:02,017 --> 00:21:05,287
It doesn't seem like there's anything
here for the Joro Spider Society.

442
00:21:05,391 --> 00:21:06,311
I don't know.

443
00:21:06,434 --> 00:21:09,858
You might not be able to tell what their
secret recruitment note is just by looking at it.

444
00:21:09,934 --> 00:21:11,594
What? What do you mean by that?

445
00:21:12,087 --> 00:21:16,212
Well, they might have come up with a code to
keep the Executive Committee from finding them out.

446
00:21:17,045 --> 00:21:18,904
A code. I see.

447
00:21:19,047 --> 00:21:19,696
Uh-huh.

448
00:21:19,747 --> 00:21:21,374
But if it's here, we're gonna break it.

449
00:21:21,501 --> 00:21:21,976
Found something.

450
00:21:22,059 --> 00:21:22,796
Huh?

451
00:21:29,757 --> 00:21:31,142
There it is, all right.

452
00:21:31,395 --> 00:21:34,517
I would imagine they'd pick a more
crowded place on the board to hide it.

453
00:21:34,745 --> 00:21:36,629
Definitely the work of amateurs.

454
00:21:36,756 --> 00:21:39,466
They're inexperienced first years trying to be rebels.

455
00:21:39,552 --> 00:21:42,652
If this secret club knew at all what they
were doing, our job would have been much harder.

456
00:21:42,771 --> 00:21:44,193
That's a good point.

457
00:21:44,809 --> 00:21:46,226
It's still weird, though.

458
00:21:46,497 --> 00:21:50,001
Their lack of any real skill is
painfully obvious, now that you mention it.

459
00:21:50,096 --> 00:21:52,177
But I'm not actually surprised in the least.

460
00:21:52,931 --> 00:21:54,680
No stamp of approval from the Committee?

461
00:21:54,705 --> 00:21:55,300
Well...

462
00:21:55,579 --> 00:21:57,037
I'd better report this.

463
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:00,035
All right.

464
00:22:00,168 --> 00:22:03,556
I'm gonna stop by the faculty room to
turn in my essay, then start to head home.

465
00:22:03,699 --> 00:22:04,381
Yeah, okay.

466
00:22:04,461 --> 00:22:06,059
I guess I'll walk along with you, then.

467
00:22:06,303 --> 00:22:07,351
It is getting late.

468
00:22:07,434 --> 00:22:09,331
Until the next time we meet, then, gentlemen.

469
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:11,865
"Inexperienced first years trying to be rebels."

470
00:22:12,024 --> 00:22:13,549
I'll never forget that.

471
00:22:20,509 --> 00:22:24,338
Well, your "fight mystery with mystery"
plan was a real success. I applaud you.

472
00:22:24,505 --> 00:22:25,726
Yeah, thanks for all your help.

473
00:22:25,809 --> 00:22:28,366
For some reason I had a feeling she was coming to find us.

474
00:22:28,422 --> 00:22:29,262
Ah!

475
00:22:29,346 --> 00:22:31,951
So that's why you wrote the note and got the pin ready.

476
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:34,214
Well, looks like you have a knack for deception.

477
00:22:35,601 --> 00:22:36,767
I'm curious, though.

478
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:40,434
Why did you go to so much trouble to set
up that elaborate ruse just to distract her

479
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:42,059
from the music room mystery?

480
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:45,892
Don't tell me that silly ghost story
actually freaked you out or something.

481
00:22:48,476 --> 00:22:50,436
The music room was too far away.

482
00:22:50,747 --> 00:22:51,708
Are you kidding?

483
00:22:51,811 --> 00:22:52,718
No, I'm not.

484
00:22:52,964 --> 00:22:57,611
I wanted to find a way to get us close to the main
entrance, wrap up the mystery so I could turn in my essay,

485
00:22:57,729 --> 00:22:59,381
and get the heck out of there fast.

486
00:23:00,709 --> 00:23:02,670
I wish I could say I'm surprised.

487
00:23:03,184 --> 00:23:04,521
That's typical Hotaro.

488
00:23:04,546 --> 00:23:06,897
Please. I have to know!

489
00:23:07,222 --> 00:23:08,518
If I have to do something,

490
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:11,203
I'll do it as quickly as possible. Right?

491
00:23:11,386 --> 00:23:12,226
No way.

492
00:23:12,465 --> 00:23:13,810
You won't get away with that.

493
00:23:14,932 --> 00:23:16,814
If you're gonna proclaim your motto,

494
00:23:16,972 --> 00:23:19,563
do it with your head held high and don't paraphrase!

495
00:23:19,785 --> 00:23:23,534
If I didn't know any better, I'd say
you were just making a sorry excuse.

496
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:31,976
Distracting from one mystery with another mystery?

497
00:23:32,139 --> 00:23:34,006
I approve. Nice curveball.

498
00:23:34,466 --> 00:23:35,935
But you know something, Hotaro?

499
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,010
What you did today wasn't really your style.

500
00:23:38,859 --> 00:23:43,267
When Chitanda showed up, why didn't you just
blow her off, like the lazy bones we know and love?

501
00:23:43,485 --> 00:23:45,480
That was your fatal mistake this afternoon.

502
00:23:45,567 --> 00:23:46,878
You'd have been home already.

503
00:23:47,254 --> 00:23:50,319
Sometimes, you don't know how
to best live by your own motto.

504
00:23:52,185 --> 00:23:53,257
Maybe you're right.

505
00:23:53,434 --> 00:23:55,934
"Inexperienced first years trying to be rebels."

506
00:23:56,236 --> 00:23:58,976
That's exactly what you were today, as a matter of fact.

507
00:23:59,192 --> 00:24:01,560
Chitanda is throwing you off your game, my friend.

508
00:24:01,703 --> 00:24:03,181
I didn't expect that of you.

509
00:24:03,403 --> 00:24:06,326
I wondered why you took such a meandering detour.

510
00:24:06,699 --> 00:24:10,697
I understand you were trying to trick Chitanda
and all, but there are more efficient ways.

511
00:24:10,927 --> 00:24:11,387
Anyway...

512
00:24:11,412 --> 00:24:13,000
I wasn't actually trying to trick her.

513
00:24:14,541 --> 00:24:15,860
No, of course you weren't.

514
00:24:16,257 --> 00:24:18,517
You were just putting the situation on hold for later.

515
00:24:21,111 --> 00:24:22,025
On hold?

516
00:24:23,703 --> 00:24:25,442
Oh, yeah. That's right!

517
00:24:27,356 --> 00:24:29,192
Speaking of the other situation,

518
00:24:29,335 --> 00:24:31,146
what do you make of the music room thing?

519
00:24:31,416 --> 00:24:31,948
Right.

520
00:24:32,434 --> 00:24:35,079
Well, the alleged ghost had
messed-up hair and bloodshot eyes,

521
00:24:35,127 --> 00:24:37,374
which sounds like someone who just woke up from a nap.

522
00:24:37,399 --> 00:24:38,470
Oh. You're right.

523
00:24:38,495 --> 00:24:41,681
Some Piano Club member got
sleepy and decided to have a rest.

524
00:24:41,768 --> 00:24:44,795
She was nervous that she'd sleep
past six o'clock,when they lock up,

525
00:24:44,906 --> 00:24:48,030
so she set the alarm on the cd
player and put in "Moonlight Sonata."

526
00:24:48,244 --> 00:24:49,365
It's as simple as that.

527
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,559
That makes sense.

528
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:53,718
I'm sure if we'd checked it out, we'd
have known what happened right away.

529
00:24:55,307 --> 00:24:57,062
The music room was too far away.

530
00:24:57,173 --> 00:24:58,492
Yeah, I hear that.

531
00:24:58,738 --> 00:24:59,980
Even so, you know what?

532
00:25:00,043 --> 00:25:00,541
Hm?

533
00:25:00,566 --> 00:25:03,322
I have a feeling you wasted a
lot of time by avoiding the trip.

534
00:25:03,365 --> 00:25:05,617
You'd have conserved more energy by checking it out.

535
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:07,309
Be careful next time.

536
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:09,559
This might end up costing you more than you think.

537
00:25:09,642 --> 00:25:10,458
Hm?

538
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,465
This is me!

539
00:25:16,495 --> 00:25:18,684
Don't worry! I don't judge!

540
00:25:18,935 --> 00:25:20,659
And I'm not gonna hold it over your head!

541
00:25:20,794 --> 00:25:21,421
Bye!

542
00:25:27,342 --> 00:25:30,235
On hold, huh? Right.

543
00:27:05,976 --> 00:27:06,936
Next time:

544
00:27:07,063 --> 00:27:09,928
"The Prestigious Classic Lit Club's Activities."
