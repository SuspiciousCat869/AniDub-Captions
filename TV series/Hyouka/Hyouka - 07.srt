1
00:00:01,904 --> 00:00:04,127
So, did you watch the show last night?

2
00:00:04,152 --> 00:00:04,907
What show?

3
00:00:04,932 --> 00:00:06,417
What do you mean, "what show"?

4
00:00:06,529 --> 00:00:09,349
"The News Crew Saw It: The
Startling Truth Behind 'Hassie',

5
00:00:09,404 --> 00:00:10,911
the Giant Eel of Lake Hamana."

6
00:00:10,936 --> 00:00:12,836
Oh, yeah. I watched that, too!

7
00:00:12,868 --> 00:00:15,068
Stuff like that always turns out to be fake.

8
00:00:15,093 --> 00:00:17,619
"Upon seeing the true nature, he knew it was no ghost,

9
00:00:17,706 --> 00:00:19,049
but a beckoning flower."

10
00:00:19,081 --> 00:00:20,590
You're such a party pooper.

11
00:00:20,702 --> 00:00:22,792
I think legends make life more exciting!

12
00:00:22,862 --> 00:00:24,245
Chi, you with me?

13
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,343
I am curious as to the veracity of the monster sightings.

14
00:00:27,438 --> 00:00:30,712
Nobody can say for sure if the
eel exists, but I hope it does.

15
00:00:30,814 --> 00:00:32,300
It's more fun that way, y'know?

16
00:00:32,896 --> 00:00:34,065
There are no ghosts.

17
00:00:34,173 --> 00:00:35,557
Just beckoning flowers.

18
00:00:36,278 --> 00:00:37,860
Classic Hotaro.

19
00:02:09,745 --> 00:02:12,795
The Classic Lit Club consists of a whopping four members.

20
00:02:12,914 --> 00:02:15,346
All of whom are now being bounced around on a bus,

21
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:20,415
headed into the wilderness for what will
surely be an energy-wasting getaway. Yippie skippy.

22
00:02:20,565 --> 00:02:23,076
The bus's last stop is at Zaizen Village,

23
00:02:23,124 --> 00:02:25,770
a place best known for mountain climbing and hot springs.

24
00:02:25,818 --> 00:02:27,224
The springs are what we're after.

25
00:02:27,374 --> 00:02:30,886
I've always been of the opinion that
during summer vacation, one should vacate.

26
00:02:31,021 --> 00:02:31,633
But still...

27
00:02:31,816 --> 00:02:33,215
We haven't been together long,

28
00:02:33,302 --> 00:02:35,645
but I feel like the club's become a tight-knit group.

29
00:02:35,804 --> 00:02:38,569
Since it's summer break, why
don't we all go to the hot springs?

30
00:02:38,641 --> 00:02:39,093
Huh?

31
00:02:39,293 --> 00:02:40,461
Well, what d'you say?

32
00:02:40,548 --> 00:02:41,437
You wanna go?

33
00:02:42,167 --> 00:02:44,995
Yeah... Okay.

34
00:02:45,184 --> 00:02:47,879
The shuttle should be here to get us any minute now.

35
00:02:47,991 --> 00:02:50,278
Wow. Great view from up here, huh?

36
00:02:50,381 --> 00:02:52,292
Oreki... You okay?

37
00:02:52,369 --> 00:02:53,672
You don't look so good.

38
00:02:53,775 --> 00:02:54,824
Carsick.

39
00:02:55,001 --> 00:02:58,345
Hotaro wouldn't be Hotaro if he
didn't find something to complain about.

40
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,426
The trip was only an hour and a half.

41
00:03:00,529 --> 00:03:01,501
What a sad sack.

42
00:03:01,578 --> 00:03:03,906
Hey, by the way, thanks for scoring us rooms.

43
00:03:03,985 --> 00:03:06,501
No problem! I've got family who own an inn up here,

44
00:03:06,584 --> 00:03:10,412
and since they're renovating and can't accept
regular guests, they said we could stay for free.

45
00:03:13,251 --> 00:03:14,194
Come on, Oreki.

46
00:03:14,274 --> 00:03:15,052
We're here.

47
00:03:16,306 --> 00:03:18,642
Let the vacationing commence!

48
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,654
Hop to it, Oreki, or we'll leave you behind.

49
00:03:21,948 --> 00:03:24,259
Let's go! I'm ready to check out this inn.

50
00:03:25,626 --> 00:03:26,884
Thank you for coming.

51
00:03:27,046 --> 00:03:28,614
Welcome to Seizanso.

52
00:03:29,508 --> 00:03:31,743
This little darling is Rie Zenna.

53
00:03:32,028 --> 00:03:34,095
And this is her younger sister Kayo.

54
00:03:34,285 --> 00:03:34,720
It's a pleasure.

55
00:03:34,744 --> 00:03:35,186
Nice to meetcha.

56
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:37,751
You girls are in sixth grade and fourth grade, right?

57
00:03:37,861 --> 00:03:38,696
You've both gotten so tall...

58
00:03:38,721 --> 00:03:39,205
Hug!

59
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:40,357
Sis! Careful.

60
00:03:40,421 --> 00:03:42,859
Your rooms are on the second floor at the end.

61
00:03:44,718 --> 00:03:45,361
Whoa!

62
00:03:45,654 --> 00:03:47,443
Hotaro, hurry and check this out!

63
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:52,289
We got a good room. Look at this sweet view.

64
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:55,348
Maybe coming here wasn't such a terrible idea.

65
00:03:55,625 --> 00:04:00,028
But I still don't know about the whole "club
vacation" thing. It would be a lot more relaxing solo.

66
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:03,112
Except planning a vacation takes so much energy!

67
00:04:03,231 --> 00:04:04,695
Come on! Cheer up!

68
00:04:04,859 --> 00:04:07,316
And don't forget that the only reason this trip happened

69
00:04:07,341 --> 00:04:11,547
was because Chitanda organized it and
Mayaka hooked us up with a place to stay.

70
00:04:13,906 --> 00:04:15,066
Hurry up, you two!

71
00:04:15,091 --> 00:04:16,220
It's time for dinner.

72
00:04:16,402 --> 00:04:17,539
You heard 'em.

73
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,279
Let's get some chow, okay?

74
00:04:23,736 --> 00:04:25,071
I smell cheese.

75
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,455
Quiche? Gratin. Maybe fondue?

76
00:04:30,401 --> 00:04:31,489
Or not.

77
00:04:31,856 --> 00:04:32,919
Ready to eat?

78
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,905
Thank you very much for the food!

79
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:36,946
Be sure to save room for dessert!

80
00:04:36,986 --> 00:04:38,673
Let me guess: cheesecake?

81
00:04:39,023 --> 00:04:40,373
How did you know?

82
00:04:40,398 --> 00:04:41,280
I could smell it.

83
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:42,821
That's amazing!

84
00:04:42,909 --> 00:04:43,787
Not really.

85
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:45,880
So that stuff Maya said was true!

86
00:04:46,221 --> 00:04:47,610
What did you tell them?

87
00:04:47,824 --> 00:04:49,770
We're gonna set off fireworks tomorrow!

88
00:04:49,795 --> 00:04:50,599
That sounds fun.

89
00:04:50,686 --> 00:04:52,735
Yeah, Dad bought some for us yesterday...

90
00:04:53,322 --> 00:04:54,022
Hey!

91
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,610
What are you doin', clumsy?

92
00:04:55,635 --> 00:04:56,915
Oops. I'm really sorry.

93
00:04:57,169 --> 00:04:57,551
Here.

94
00:04:57,599 --> 00:04:59,427
Oh. Thanks, I'll just clean this up.

95
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:00,546
Did it burn you?

96
00:05:00,593 --> 00:05:01,578
No, I'm fine.

97
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,525
Geez. Try to be more careful.

98
00:05:05,578 --> 00:05:07,502
Man. I'm really stuffed.

99
00:05:09,171 --> 00:05:09,991
No Satoshi.

100
00:05:10,372 --> 00:05:12,056
He must've gone down to the baths.

101
00:05:20,685 --> 00:05:23,583
I guess the springs are kinda
the point of this place, huh?

102
00:05:23,787 --> 00:05:24,329
Oh.

103
00:05:24,437 --> 00:05:24,760
Hm?

104
00:05:26,817 --> 00:05:29,384
Funny bumping into you like this. Where are you headed?

105
00:05:29,694 --> 00:05:31,402
Same place as you, I'd guess.

106
00:05:31,572 --> 00:05:32,137
Where's Ibara?

107
00:05:32,268 --> 00:05:33,071
I'm not sure.

108
00:05:33,096 --> 00:05:34,804
She went off with the girls someplace.

109
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:36,877
I know this is out of the blue,

110
00:05:36,956 --> 00:05:39,671
but would you mind telling me a
little about what your sister's like?

111
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,565
Yeah, that's out of the blue all right.

112
00:05:42,001 --> 00:05:44,948
I guess that you're curious
because you don't have any siblings.

113
00:05:45,559 --> 00:05:46,759
My sister, huh?

114
00:05:47,187 --> 00:05:49,056
She's a real character for sure.

115
00:05:49,405 --> 00:05:51,010
But she's also pretty brilliant.

116
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:53,863
I don't think I could outshine her in any way if I tried.

117
00:05:53,974 --> 00:05:54,656
Wow.

118
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:58,644
But, of course, I've never
actually wanted to try, so. Yeah.

119
00:06:00,242 --> 00:06:03,046
Anyway... What's with the sudden curiosity?

120
00:06:03,474 --> 00:06:04,826
Seeing the Zenna sisters?

121
00:06:05,778 --> 00:06:07,034
You'll think I'm silly.

122
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:09,234
But I've always wanted to have a sibling.

123
00:06:09,259 --> 00:06:11,118
An older sister or younger brother.

124
00:06:11,172 --> 00:06:13,883
Having somebody around I could always feel at home with.

125
00:06:13,963 --> 00:06:15,552
It sounds like a dream to me!

126
00:06:15,615 --> 00:06:16,966
A dream, all right.

127
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:20,336
She's wearing some seriously rose-colored glasses.

128
00:06:20,637 --> 00:06:22,781
Having a sibling is fine, I guess.

129
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:25,704
But it's not like you're guaranteed
to be best friends or anything.

130
00:06:27,357 --> 00:06:30,391
Oh. I guess there's no mixed bathing here.

131
00:06:32,393 --> 00:06:33,689
Of course there's not!

132
00:06:37,203 --> 00:06:37,909
Hm?

133
00:06:38,306 --> 00:06:39,379
Satoshi's here.

134
00:06:45,648 --> 00:06:47,817
Dad, Grandpa, hurry it up!

135
00:06:47,904 --> 00:06:49,374
You're taking forever!

136
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:56,603
Whoa. It's bigger than I expected.

137
00:07:12,095 --> 00:07:13,345
Huh?

138
00:07:14,829 --> 00:07:17,475
Well, what d'ya think? It's nice, huh?

139
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:21,620
It's like the spring water is soaking through
my skin all the way into my bones, y'know?

140
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:24,300
Aren't you worried that your
bones are gonna get waterlogged?

141
00:07:24,952 --> 00:07:27,232
I never knew you were such a funny guy.

142
00:07:27,502 --> 00:07:31,171
Well, nice to see you cracking
jokes and unclenching a bit.

143
00:07:37,869 --> 00:07:38,989
Is that Chitanda?

144
00:08:04,298 --> 00:08:05,242
Oreki!

145
00:08:05,298 --> 00:08:07,314
Whoa! What happened? Is he okay?

146
00:08:07,511 --> 00:08:08,672
He overheated.

147
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:10,259
Huh?

148
00:08:10,284 --> 00:08:12,620
Have you ever heard of anything so pathetic?

149
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:16,704
He'd barely even gotten in before he
drooped like a flower that needs watering.

150
00:08:17,175 --> 00:08:19,509
Yep. That is pretty pathetic.

151
00:08:27,963 --> 00:08:30,162
Sorry I'm being so much trouble.

152
00:08:30,316 --> 00:08:32,301
That's what friends are for, right?

153
00:08:33,069 --> 00:08:37,299
Come on, is it just physically
impossible for you to enjoy anything?

154
00:08:38,555 --> 00:08:40,253
Apparently so.

155
00:08:40,594 --> 00:08:43,177
It was probably leftover carsickness.

156
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:45,130
Must've been.

157
00:08:57,144 --> 00:08:58,567
Is that Chitanda?

158
00:08:59,209 --> 00:09:01,156
Hey, Oreki. Are you all right?

159
00:09:01,611 --> 00:09:02,759
Not really.

160
00:09:04,803 --> 00:09:06,502
You still feel really hot.

161
00:09:06,804 --> 00:09:09,125
I can bring you a cold towel if you want.

162
00:09:09,411 --> 00:09:11,828
No! No thanks!

163
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,962
I just wanna sleep.

164
00:09:14,826 --> 00:09:17,327
I'm sorry for making such a nuisance of myself.

165
00:09:18,167 --> 00:09:19,414
No, don't worry.

166
00:09:19,527 --> 00:09:22,815
We don't have big plans for the
night, just telling some ghost stories.

167
00:09:23,017 --> 00:09:23,587
Heh...

168
00:09:23,865 --> 00:09:25,037
I'm sure it'll be fun.

169
00:09:25,136 --> 00:09:27,455
If you feel better, you should come join us, okay?

170
00:09:28,202 --> 00:09:30,085
Well. Get some rest.

171
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:30,983
Thanks.

172
00:09:40,752 --> 00:09:42,575
It's not even eight o'clock yet?

173
00:09:46,244 --> 00:09:47,572
<i>Taiko</i> drums?

174
00:09:48,175 --> 00:09:51,996
The truth is, the inn didn't actually need a second hall.

175
00:09:53,624 --> 00:09:55,912
I guess they've got their window open, too.

176
00:09:57,065 --> 00:09:58,153
There's a secret.

177
00:09:58,296 --> 00:09:59,423
A secret?

178
00:09:59,566 --> 00:10:00,504
Long ago.

179
00:10:00,607 --> 00:10:03,064
An old, brooding man came to stay here.

180
00:10:03,286 --> 00:10:05,559
They put him in Room Seven of the main hall.

181
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:07,226
He said he didn't want food.

182
00:10:07,251 --> 00:10:08,887
And he didn't want a futon.

183
00:10:08,912 --> 00:10:11,056
And people should just leave him alone.

184
00:10:11,151 --> 00:10:14,927
It was strange, but he paid in
advance and came during the busy season,

185
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:17,073
so nobody asked any questions.

186
00:10:17,198 --> 00:10:20,551
However, that night, a terrible scream rang out!

187
00:10:20,601 --> 00:10:21,393
Then what?

188
00:10:21,447 --> 00:10:25,437
People looked up to see the shadowy figure
of a person with a rope around his neck,

189
00:10:25,579 --> 00:10:28,147
dimly visible, swinging back and forth.

190
00:10:28,258 --> 00:10:32,142
Rumor had it that the man had embezzled
money from the company he worked for.

191
00:10:32,467 --> 00:10:33,549
Then what? Then what?

192
00:10:33,692 --> 00:10:34,733
Will you stop that?

193
00:10:34,883 --> 00:10:39,875
After it happened, guests who stayed in Room Seven
said that they could feel something in there with them.

194
00:10:40,071 --> 00:10:43,206
They could see shadows mysteriously
appearing during the night.

195
00:10:44,303 --> 00:10:45,187
Finally,

196
00:10:45,401 --> 00:10:47,428
the ninth guest after the hanged man...

197
00:10:47,547 --> 00:10:48,986
Tell us! What happened?

198
00:10:49,343 --> 00:10:51,664
During the night, he fell suddenly ill...

199
00:10:51,774 --> 00:10:52,784
...and died!

200
00:10:52,967 --> 00:10:53,745
Oh, no!

201
00:10:53,951 --> 00:10:54,864
Then what?! Then what?!

202
00:10:54,889 --> 00:10:56,381
I said stop it!

203
00:10:56,659 --> 00:10:59,146
Well, first, Grandma called in an exorcist,

204
00:10:59,257 --> 00:11:01,262
then she had this second hall built.

205
00:11:01,482 --> 00:11:04,502
So guests could sleep far away from the haunted room.

206
00:11:04,788 --> 00:11:05,837
Where is Room Seven?

207
00:11:06,377 --> 00:11:09,085
There. Look out the window, straight ahead.

208
00:11:09,347 --> 00:11:10,396
It's that one.

209
00:11:10,904 --> 00:11:15,131
We live down on the first floor, and we try
not to come up to the second floor very much.

210
00:11:15,385 --> 00:11:16,120
Hold on!

211
00:11:16,203 --> 00:11:18,006
I thought this was just a story.

212
00:11:18,031 --> 00:11:20,557
You can't tell anyone I told you about this, okay?

213
00:11:20,707 --> 00:11:22,956
A local ghost story. How quaint.

214
00:11:23,078 --> 00:11:23,853
Hm?

215
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:44,194
Morning.

216
00:11:47,842 --> 00:11:49,312
Oh! Good morning.

217
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,058
Good morning. Is anyone else up?

218
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:52,099
Uh...

219
00:11:52,846 --> 00:11:53,783
I saw it.

220
00:11:54,578 --> 00:11:56,230
What d'you mean? Saw what?

221
00:11:56,255 --> 00:11:58,066
I was sleeping so soundly,

222
00:11:58,153 --> 00:12:00,974
then sometime after midnight a warm breeze woke me up.

223
00:12:01,093 --> 00:12:02,341
And when I rolled over...

224
00:12:02,412 --> 00:12:05,328
I saw the silhouette of a hanged
man in the room across the way,

225
00:12:05,353 --> 00:12:07,195
slowly swinging back and forth!

226
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:09,436
It's pretty rare to see Ibara so shaken up.

227
00:12:09,713 --> 00:12:12,374
Satoshi's gonna be sad he missed out on this.

228
00:12:12,715 --> 00:12:13,828
Thanks for breakfast.

229
00:12:14,075 --> 00:12:15,521
How were the baths yesterday?

230
00:12:15,553 --> 00:12:17,037
I thought they were fantastic!

231
00:12:17,229 --> 00:12:18,404
Good, I'm glad!

232
00:12:18,429 --> 00:12:18,968
Hm?

233
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,661
And I hope your futon was nice and fluffy, too!

234
00:12:21,686 --> 00:12:23,553
Yes, it was perfect, thank you!

235
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:26,532
It doesn't look like there's one for Kayo.

236
00:12:27,145 --> 00:12:31,013
Sorry you didn't sleep so well, Maya, but I
figured you could handle a little ghost story.

237
00:12:31,069 --> 00:12:33,477
Hey, it's not like I'm scared of ghosts or anything.

238
00:12:33,553 --> 00:12:35,798
But I know what I saw through that window.

239
00:12:35,861 --> 00:12:38,077
And it was seriously creepy!

240
00:12:38,815 --> 00:12:40,676
You really saw it? You're sure?

241
00:12:40,701 --> 00:12:42,256
I know what I saw, okay? Creepy, creepy!

242
00:12:42,281 --> 00:12:44,289
How could you tell them that story, Rie?

243
00:12:44,314 --> 00:12:46,563
Dad said we were never supposed to tell anyone!

244
00:12:46,856 --> 00:12:48,547
Who asked you? It's only Maya.

245
00:12:48,572 --> 00:12:50,201
I don't see what the big deal is.

246
00:12:54,662 --> 00:12:55,523
What's wrong?

247
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,486
Well... What Mayaka said she saw...

248
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,912
Do you think it was real?

249
00:13:00,997 --> 00:13:03,126
What the silhouette of a hanged man?

250
00:13:03,913 --> 00:13:07,448
Well, ghost stories are a staple of these rural areas.

251
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:08,950
They live on for generations.

252
00:13:09,108 --> 00:13:10,364
So, what are you saying?

253
00:13:10,412 --> 00:13:12,986
Do you really think she saw
the ghost of a man who died here?

254
00:13:13,097 --> 00:13:14,170
No, I don't.

255
00:13:14,829 --> 00:13:17,357
In that case, I must have been mistaken, too.

256
00:13:17,992 --> 00:13:19,620
Mistaken about what?

257
00:13:22,251 --> 00:13:23,846
I saw the same thing she did.

258
00:13:23,871 --> 00:13:25,532
The shadow of a hanged man.

259
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,527
I woke up when Mayaka started freaking out.

260
00:13:28,733 --> 00:13:31,695
And when I looked out at the
room across the way, I saw it.

261
00:13:32,004 --> 00:13:32,581
Oh.

262
00:13:32,641 --> 00:13:34,993
I thought my mind must have been playing tricks on me.

263
00:13:35,223 --> 00:13:37,314
But if she and I both saw the same thing...

264
00:13:37,607 --> 00:13:39,633
You both must have mistook what you saw.

265
00:13:39,857 --> 00:13:40,865
Like in that saying.

266
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:42,843
The one Satoshi quoted on the bus.

267
00:13:42,868 --> 00:13:44,647
It was nothing but a beckoning flower?

268
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:45,306
Mm-hm.

269
00:13:46,521 --> 00:13:47,769
Well, if that's true,

270
00:13:47,968 --> 00:13:49,700
what was it we were really seeing?

271
00:13:50,018 --> 00:13:50,757
Yeah!

272
00:13:51,671 --> 00:13:54,395
If you're so smart, tell us
what we were actually looking at!

273
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,174
Wait, why should I have to...

274
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:55,818
Oreki!

275
00:13:55,897 --> 00:13:57,454
Investigate this with us!

276
00:13:57,518 --> 00:13:59,496
Will you? I have to know!

277
00:14:01,412 --> 00:14:02,728
I'm sorry, Chi!

278
00:14:02,753 --> 00:14:05,924
I wanna help, but I promised
Rie I'd look over her homework.

279
00:14:05,949 --> 00:14:07,219
You can leave it to us.

280
00:14:07,244 --> 00:14:09,512
Oreki and I will get to the bottom of this mystery!

281
00:14:09,793 --> 00:14:10,634
Isn't that right?

282
00:14:11,311 --> 00:14:12,868
As if I had a choice.

283
00:14:13,257 --> 00:14:14,995
We don't have to go far, anyway.

284
00:14:15,163 --> 00:14:17,030
That's some consolation at least.

285
00:14:17,268 --> 00:14:17,840
Okay.

286
00:14:17,927 --> 00:14:21,553
So you saw this shadow-thing in the
room directly across from yours, right?

287
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:23,140
Yes, that's where we saw it.

288
00:14:23,165 --> 00:14:24,039
How big was it?

289
00:14:24,182 --> 00:14:27,012
It's not like it was huge, but it wasn't small either.

290
00:14:27,113 --> 00:14:28,035
And the shape?

291
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:29,741
Well, it's hard to say exactly.

292
00:14:29,766 --> 00:14:30,355
The color?

293
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,309
I don't know. It was in shadow.

294
00:14:32,507 --> 00:14:33,392
Yeah, right.

295
00:14:33,579 --> 00:14:37,262
Whatever it was, it was lit from behind so
it looked like the silhouette of a person.

296
00:14:37,473 --> 00:14:38,761
That's how it seemed to me.

297
00:14:38,943 --> 00:14:40,286
So then it was backlit.

298
00:14:40,492 --> 00:14:43,575
Around here, the only source of
light at night would have been the moon.

299
00:14:43,694 --> 00:14:45,291
That's what I was thinking, too.

300
00:14:45,402 --> 00:14:48,009
And the moon was bright enough
that it could have lit something up.

301
00:14:48,366 --> 00:14:49,669
Do you think that means--

302
00:14:50,376 --> 00:14:51,155
The shutters.

303
00:14:51,242 --> 00:14:53,555
So what time did you finish your stories and go to sleep?

304
00:14:53,618 --> 00:14:54,960
About ten, I think.

305
00:14:55,158 --> 00:14:56,041
And the shutters then?

306
00:14:56,081 --> 00:14:57,953
I believe they were closed at that point.

307
00:14:58,384 --> 00:14:58,953
Huh.

308
00:14:59,155 --> 00:15:02,125
If the shutters were closed then, there's
no way there could have been a shadow.

309
00:15:02,726 --> 00:15:04,851
Which means we've run into a little snag.

310
00:15:05,065 --> 00:15:08,259
At this point, our best bet is to
check out Room Seven in the main hall.

311
00:15:08,315 --> 00:15:10,357
This is so fun, don't you think?

312
00:15:10,683 --> 00:15:12,819
I'm extra-glad we came to this place now!

313
00:15:12,844 --> 00:15:14,425
And I'm extra-wishing we hadn't.

314
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,056
Hey!

315
00:15:19,471 --> 00:15:21,107
Oh. Yes. Hello.

316
00:15:21,846 --> 00:15:22,529
You talk.

317
00:15:22,584 --> 00:15:22,954
Huh?

318
00:15:22,978 --> 00:15:24,229
I really suck with kids.

319
00:15:24,348 --> 00:15:25,588
Oh, okay.

320
00:15:26,064 --> 00:15:28,169
Kayo, can we borrow you for a sec?

321
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:33,053
Oreki and I would like to have
a look around in the main hall.

322
00:15:33,191 --> 00:15:35,599
The main hall? Why? What for?

323
00:15:35,766 --> 00:15:38,845
We're investigating the creepy
shadow we talked about this morning.

324
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:41,779
If it's not too much trouble,
maybe you could show us Room Seven?

325
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:44,995
I'm really sorry, but I don't think I should do that.

326
00:15:45,124 --> 00:15:48,094
If I did, my sister would get mad at me.

327
00:15:48,352 --> 00:15:50,019
Okay, at least tell us one thing.

328
00:15:50,177 --> 00:15:52,774
Is the supposedly haunted room still used for guests?

329
00:15:53,602 --> 00:15:54,540
No, it's not.

330
00:15:54,565 --> 00:15:58,720
In the main hall, the baths and the dining room
are the only areas where the guests are allowed.

331
00:15:58,878 --> 00:16:00,287
So, the room's vacant then?

332
00:16:00,482 --> 00:16:02,881
The whole second floor is used for storage now.

333
00:16:03,613 --> 00:16:05,328
Please. May I go?

334
00:16:06,154 --> 00:16:08,753
Of course. You've been very help... ful.

335
00:16:09,299 --> 00:16:10,953
There, you see? She hates me.

336
00:16:11,239 --> 00:16:12,376
No, I doubt it.

337
00:16:12,479 --> 00:16:14,787
She probably finds all boys intimidating.

338
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:16,346
What a sweet girl!

339
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:17,635
Mm...

340
00:16:18,295 --> 00:16:20,997
Is it a big problem that we can't get in to see the room?

341
00:16:21,068 --> 00:16:22,928
Not so much a problem as a hassle.

342
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:25,334
This would be easier if we could inspect the scene.

343
00:16:25,476 --> 00:16:28,813
Oh! I remember doing these, too.

344
00:16:29,642 --> 00:16:30,146
Hm?

345
00:16:33,635 --> 00:16:35,480
Morning radio calisthenics.

346
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:38,318
I went to them up until the year before last.

347
00:16:38,763 --> 00:16:40,912
Until her second year of middle school?

348
00:16:40,937 --> 00:16:42,089
Seriously?

349
00:16:43,782 --> 00:16:45,847
We should check around the other side.

350
00:16:47,912 --> 00:16:49,016
The ground's muddy.

351
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:50,262
Did it rain last night?

352
00:16:50,455 --> 00:16:51,973
Yeah. A little.

353
00:16:52,648 --> 00:16:55,969
In order to create a shadow that you
would see from your room across the way,

354
00:16:56,017 --> 00:16:58,670
both the east and west side
shutters would have to have been open.

355
00:16:59,965 --> 00:17:01,237
Excuse me.

356
00:17:02,347 --> 00:17:03,914
If you're hungry, lunch is ready.

357
00:17:05,412 --> 00:17:06,638
Well, back to work!

358
00:17:06,663 --> 00:17:08,124
Thank you for joining us.

359
00:17:12,138 --> 00:17:13,900
Just look at those two together!

360
00:17:13,925 --> 00:17:15,220
It must be nice.

361
00:17:15,338 --> 00:17:18,214
Having a sister, you mean? So
do you wish that you had one?

362
00:17:18,408 --> 00:17:19,700
Yeah. Kinda.

363
00:17:19,771 --> 00:17:21,194
So, find anything out?

364
00:17:21,281 --> 00:17:21,933
No.

365
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,872
We're just getting started. I do have a theory, though.

366
00:17:25,556 --> 00:17:27,200
Yeah? Then let's hear.

367
00:17:27,272 --> 00:17:27,629
Huh?

368
00:17:28,885 --> 00:17:30,028
Enough of this.

369
00:17:30,353 --> 00:17:31,787
What are you three talking about?

370
00:17:32,022 --> 00:17:34,000
It isn't nice to leave a buddy in the dark.

371
00:17:34,318 --> 00:17:37,760
If you're so anxious to be kept in the
loop, then quit disappearing all the time.

372
00:17:37,815 --> 00:17:38,593
We never see you.

373
00:17:38,618 --> 00:17:40,328
I'm being polite, okay.

374
00:17:40,595 --> 00:17:43,296
It's good manners to visit the hot springs repeatedly.

375
00:17:43,321 --> 00:17:44,433
Is he making that up?

376
00:17:44,505 --> 00:17:45,595
Ta-dah!

377
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,301
Well. Like my yukata?

378
00:17:47,388 --> 00:17:48,811
Wow! It's lovely.

379
00:17:48,866 --> 00:17:49,831
Looks great!

380
00:17:50,733 --> 00:17:53,459
I finally got one at the beginning of summer vacation.

381
00:17:53,594 --> 00:17:54,856
You've said you wanted one...

382
00:17:54,881 --> 00:17:56,287
Can't say I'm impressed.

383
00:17:56,453 --> 00:17:57,970
What's wrong with it?

384
00:17:57,995 --> 00:17:59,187
You see the sash?

385
00:17:59,926 --> 00:18:01,166
It's not the real deal.

386
00:18:01,293 --> 00:18:02,667
Well, it looks real enough to me.

387
00:18:02,786 --> 00:18:05,591
You're the last person I'd come to for fashion advice.

388
00:18:05,694 --> 00:18:06,887
Check out the bow.

389
00:18:06,941 --> 00:18:09,031
It's a separate piece clipped onto the sash.

390
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:11,065
I don't acknowledge that as a yukata.

391
00:18:11,152 --> 00:18:13,114
I acknowledge you as ridiculous.

392
00:18:17,016 --> 00:18:18,183
Is something the matter?

393
00:18:19,605 --> 00:18:20,073
Hm?

394
00:18:20,328 --> 00:18:21,812
That stupid shadow.

395
00:18:22,114 --> 00:18:24,125
It's got me as jumpy as those other two.

396
00:18:30,274 --> 00:18:31,839
Wanna go back to the same spring?

397
00:18:32,452 --> 00:18:33,183
Sure!

398
00:18:34,089 --> 00:18:35,423
The hanged silhouette.

399
00:18:35,701 --> 00:18:39,490
It's the product of Chitanda's and
Ibara's false impression,nothing more.

400
00:18:39,704 --> 00:18:41,302
Just a beckoning flower.

401
00:18:42,034 --> 00:18:44,432
We're still missing a piece of the puzzle.

402
00:18:49,174 --> 00:18:50,677
Let's walk back together.

403
00:18:52,515 --> 00:18:53,958
Satoshi's here.

404
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:57,271
All right.

405
00:18:57,311 --> 00:18:59,453
You finished eating at the inn the same time we did.

406
00:18:59,647 --> 00:19:01,371
So how'd you end up getting here before us?

407
00:19:01,396 --> 00:19:02,030
Well,

408
00:19:02,055 --> 00:19:06,412
if you slide down the cliff behind Seizanso,
you end up at a spot right behind this spring.

409
00:19:06,631 --> 00:19:09,197
Sliding down a cliff just to save a couple of minutes?

410
00:19:09,292 --> 00:19:11,135
That's vintage Satoshi.

411
00:19:15,871 --> 00:19:18,952
I don't have an explanation
that will satisfy Chitanda yet.

412
00:19:19,214 --> 00:19:21,328
The source of the shadow is easy enough.

413
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:24,618
The question is, how did it wind up in Room Seven?

414
00:19:26,238 --> 00:19:28,750
Hotaro, you're not gonna faint again, are you?

415
00:19:28,908 --> 00:19:29,369
Hey.

416
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,007
Tell me about last night-- anything interesting happen?

417
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:33,793
Besides the whole fainting thing?

418
00:19:33,818 --> 00:19:34,994
Yes, besides that!

419
00:19:35,129 --> 00:19:37,178
Well, we all told ghost stories.

420
00:19:37,401 --> 00:19:39,593
And I was surrounded by more girls than I could handle.

421
00:19:39,618 --> 00:19:41,563
No, something more official.

422
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:43,956
Oh, sure. There was a summer festival.

423
00:19:44,377 --> 00:19:45,814
You heard the <i>taiko</i> drums, right?

424
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:47,728
<i>Taiko</i> drums.

425
00:19:48,539 --> 00:19:51,021
That's it! A summer festival!

426
00:19:51,272 --> 00:19:52,845
That explains everything!

427
00:19:53,106 --> 00:19:55,148
So? That mean something?

428
00:20:00,069 --> 00:20:00,899
Ah!

429
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:04,203
I know what the shadow really was.

430
00:20:04,345 --> 00:20:05,184
Probably...

431
00:20:05,654 --> 00:20:08,095
I think it was a yukata hanging on a hanger.

432
00:20:08,196 --> 00:20:08,839
Huh?

433
00:20:11,827 --> 00:20:14,537
But why would there be a yukata hanging in that room?

434
00:20:14,781 --> 00:20:18,357
And for that matter, why would someone
leave the shutters open to display it?

435
00:20:19,168 --> 00:20:20,899
Displaying it wasn't the point.

436
00:20:21,399 --> 00:20:22,210
So...?

437
00:20:22,322 --> 00:20:24,029
It was hanging there to dry.

438
00:20:24,164 --> 00:20:25,674
The yukata was wet.

439
00:20:26,254 --> 00:20:28,829
The reason the shutters were
open was to let the breeze through,

440
00:20:28,932 --> 00:20:30,855
so that it would dry more quickly.

441
00:20:30,925 --> 00:20:32,054
But, why?

442
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,666
It rained last night.

443
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:34,937
That's not what I mean.

444
00:20:34,962 --> 00:20:36,345
Why was it in Room Seven?

445
00:20:36,424 --> 00:20:40,230
Because in a deserted room, no one
would see that it had been hung up to dry.

446
00:20:40,325 --> 00:20:41,461
Except we saw it.

447
00:20:41,815 --> 00:20:42,445
True.

448
00:20:42,907 --> 00:20:45,172
But it's the family they were hiding it from.

449
00:20:45,305 --> 00:20:46,458
The family?

450
00:20:47,173 --> 00:20:48,703
The person who hung it there...

451
00:20:48,968 --> 00:20:50,144
...was Kayo.

452
00:20:51,106 --> 00:20:53,235
Kayo was envious of Rie's yukata,

453
00:20:53,322 --> 00:20:54,562
and she wanted to wear it.

454
00:20:54,665 --> 00:20:56,794
But I doubt Rie would lend it to her.

455
00:20:56,961 --> 00:20:59,122
But why not? They're sisters.

456
00:20:59,281 --> 00:21:02,287
Didn't you notice? Rie marks all her stuff.

457
00:21:02,491 --> 00:21:03,993
She makes it clear which cup,

458
00:21:04,151 --> 00:21:07,399
which radio calisthenics card, and which ball is hers.

459
00:21:07,929 --> 00:21:11,637
That kind of person isn't going to
lend out her most treasured possession.

460
00:21:11,834 --> 00:21:12,628
Oh.

461
00:21:13,661 --> 00:21:15,289
But Kayo still wanted to borrow it.

462
00:21:15,656 --> 00:21:19,333
So she snuck it out of the inn and
wore it to the summer festival last night.

463
00:21:19,643 --> 00:21:21,772
This would've been around eight o'clock.

464
00:21:22,068 --> 00:21:23,727
Kayo went to the festival?

465
00:21:23,942 --> 00:21:25,205
That's my theory.

466
00:21:25,435 --> 00:21:28,240
I saw someone leaving the place at eight last night.

467
00:21:30,401 --> 00:21:33,079
And Kayo wasn't there when you
were telling ghost stories, right?

468
00:21:33,414 --> 00:21:34,254
Yeah, you're right.

469
00:21:34,279 --> 00:21:35,327
She wasn't there.

470
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:37,805
Unfortunately for Kayo,

471
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:40,137
she ran into some bad luck at the festival.

472
00:21:40,259 --> 00:21:41,406
It started raining.

473
00:21:42,685 --> 00:21:45,632
The rain let up quickly, but the yukata still got wet.

474
00:21:46,274 --> 00:21:49,286
Kayo remembered that we would be
setting off fireworks the next day.

475
00:21:49,699 --> 00:21:51,923
And Rie would surely wanna wear the yukata for that.

476
00:21:52,296 --> 00:21:53,989
If it wasn't dry by tomorrow,

477
00:21:54,014 --> 00:21:56,293
Rie would know what she'd done for sure.

478
00:21:57,724 --> 00:22:00,188
The family would see it on the main hall's first floor.

479
00:22:00,457 --> 00:22:02,275
And the other hall was where we were staying.

480
00:22:02,608 --> 00:22:04,850
She couldn't use the dryer in the middle of the night.

481
00:22:05,007 --> 00:22:07,107
So, she waited for everyone to go to sleep

482
00:22:07,186 --> 00:22:10,800
and dried the yukata in the most
distant room on the second floor.

483
00:22:11,203 --> 00:22:13,589
But poor Kayo's bad luck continued.

484
00:22:13,906 --> 00:22:15,995
Moonlight shone in through the open window,

485
00:22:16,219 --> 00:22:18,412
illuminating the yukata's silhouette.

486
00:22:20,057 --> 00:22:21,781
And then, to make matters worse,

487
00:22:21,872 --> 00:22:24,387
we started investigating the mysterious shadow.

488
00:22:24,601 --> 00:22:26,709
Kayo must have been a nervous wreck.

489
00:22:27,668 --> 00:22:29,719
That must have been her shadow I saw.

490
00:22:29,941 --> 00:22:32,164
Sneaking between the sliding doors.

491
00:22:33,387 --> 00:22:34,445
Kayo...

492
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,765
She put the yukata back early in the morning.

493
00:22:37,953 --> 00:22:41,745
Unlike Rie, Kayo went to radio calisthenics every day.

494
00:22:41,952 --> 00:22:43,851
It would've been easy enough to return it.

495
00:22:45,329 --> 00:22:46,664
So that's it then.

496
00:22:47,164 --> 00:22:49,245
I'm not going to tell Ibara about this.

497
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:51,335
I think it's kind of a family matter.

498
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:55,571
If that's true...

499
00:22:57,390 --> 00:23:00,480
...then it means that the two
of them don't actually get along.

500
00:23:02,316 --> 00:23:02,903
I mean,

501
00:23:03,319 --> 00:23:05,349
a sister who won't lend you her yukata...

502
00:23:13,401 --> 00:23:15,052
That's just how it is with siblings.

503
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:16,199
Sometimes you fight.

504
00:23:16,223 --> 00:23:17,261
You know, I...

505
00:23:17,453 --> 00:23:18,975
I wanted a sibling.

506
00:23:19,179 --> 00:23:21,082
An older sister I could look up to.

507
00:23:21,558 --> 00:23:23,490
Or a younger brother I could look out for.

508
00:23:27,828 --> 00:23:30,544
Is Chitanda's idea of the perfect sibling real,

509
00:23:31,749 --> 00:23:33,444
or is it a beckoning flower?

510
00:23:36,751 --> 00:23:38,179
So hot.

511
00:23:42,167 --> 00:23:43,078
You ready?

512
00:23:43,264 --> 00:23:43,947
Yeah.

513
00:23:56,628 --> 00:24:00,044
Well, maybe it's actually a little bit of both.

514
00:25:36,738 --> 00:25:37,539
Next time:

515
00:25:37,666 --> 00:25:39,189
"Let's Go To the Screening!"
