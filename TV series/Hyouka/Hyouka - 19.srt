1
00:00:02,397 --> 00:00:05,142
I bet if I picked up a microphone and said,

2
00:00:05,239 --> 00:00:07,327
"Today, the weather will be pleasant,"

3
00:00:07,525 --> 00:00:09,939
anyone from Japan who heard me would just think,

4
00:00:10,092 --> 00:00:12,927
"Oh, Oreki must be testing that microphone."

5
00:00:13,474 --> 00:00:14,937
Ten seconds left.

6
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:18,576
But people from other countries
would think I was giving a forecast.

7
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:21,714
They'd assume I just wanted
them to know it would be clear.

8
00:00:21,856 --> 00:00:24,359
Okay, time's up. Pass your papers to the front.

9
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,232
Both assumptions could be considered reasonable.

10
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:34,481
Both parties have a fifty-fifty shot at being right.

11
00:00:34,632 --> 00:00:36,054
It all depends on luck.

12
00:00:37,289 --> 00:00:39,080
What's the world coming to, man?

13
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,086
I've been wondering...

14
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:31,595
Your uncle Jun.

15
00:02:31,912 --> 00:02:34,164
Did everything go all right with his funeral?

16
00:02:34,295 --> 00:02:36,372
It turned out very well. Thank you.

17
00:02:36,452 --> 00:02:37,291
Oh, good.

18
00:02:45,421 --> 00:02:46,129
What's wrong?

19
00:02:46,952 --> 00:02:48,952
Nothing. It's just...

20
00:02:50,894 --> 00:02:51,735
Oreki...

21
00:02:52,497 --> 00:02:53,920
Could you do me a favor?

22
00:02:54,331 --> 00:02:57,282
Do you think that you could
light some incense for my uncle?

23
00:02:57,786 --> 00:02:58,952
You want me to?

24
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:00,005
Yes, please.

25
00:03:00,075 --> 00:03:03,689
I am planning to make a trip out to his
gravesite in the next few of days or so.

26
00:03:05,035 --> 00:03:06,434
And, well...

27
00:03:06,684 --> 00:03:09,627
I hoped you'd... come with me.

28
00:03:14,272 --> 00:03:15,309
Yeah, sure.

29
00:03:16,254 --> 00:03:17,073
I'll go.

30
00:03:18,481 --> 00:03:19,731
Oh, great!

31
00:03:19,814 --> 00:03:21,231
I'll be in touch with you about the details soon.

32
00:03:21,433 --> 00:03:22,000
Cool.

33
00:03:25,928 --> 00:03:27,651
I just have to tell you, Oreki,

34
00:03:27,683 --> 00:03:29,606
you have a gift when it comes to mysteries,

35
00:03:29,724 --> 00:03:31,956
and I'm grateful that you solved the one about my uncle.

36
00:03:32,046 --> 00:03:33,466
I think you're amazing.

37
00:03:34,863 --> 00:03:38,144
You know, I appreciate the sentiment,
but I've always just gotten lucky.

38
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:41,352
I wish you wouldn't treat me
like I'm a big deal or whatever.

39
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:45,929
You sure are humble. That's impressive.

40
00:03:46,539 --> 00:03:47,692
Aw, man...

41
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,313
She totally missed the point.

42
00:03:49,607 --> 00:03:53,539
Chitanda, I heard something once
upon a time that struck me as profound.

43
00:03:53,684 --> 00:03:54,589
What is that?

44
00:03:54,881 --> 00:03:57,457
"You can put poultice and plausible reason on anything."

45
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,294
Oreki, the saying goes,

46
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:04,211
"You can put plaster and plausible reason on anything."

47
00:04:04,251 --> 00:04:06,729
Uh... That's what it says?

48
00:04:07,643 --> 00:04:11,138
I just mean you can find reasons
to support anything you want.

49
00:04:11,328 --> 00:04:12,338
If you say so.

50
00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:15,778
Then the reason you've solved all
these cases is only pure, dumb luck,

51
00:04:15,826 --> 00:04:17,907
and it has nothing to do with your intelligence.

52
00:04:17,932 --> 00:04:20,028
And your talent isn't a factor either, okay?

53
00:04:20,331 --> 00:04:24,954
However, you've been able to capitalize on the luck
you've had, and follow through to the correct conclusions.

54
00:04:25,097 --> 00:04:28,164
Now isn't that, in and of
itself, a particular kind of talent?

55
00:04:28,354 --> 00:04:30,523
Are you trying to say I'm a master of reason?

56
00:04:30,548 --> 00:04:31,342
Am I wrong?

57
00:04:31,747 --> 00:04:32,868
Yeah, you are.

58
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:35,529
I couldn't tell you how I made those deductions.

59
00:04:35,554 --> 00:04:37,334
Honestly, that's the real mystery here.

60
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:39,606
If I had to guess,

61
00:04:39,645 --> 00:04:40,624
what I would say...

62
00:04:40,772 --> 00:04:44,427
...is that you have never really
taken a good, honest look at yourself.

63
00:04:46,037 --> 00:04:47,537
She's not wrong there.

64
00:04:51,348 --> 00:04:52,786
In that case, Chitanda,

65
00:04:52,881 --> 00:04:54,923
I want you to come up with a situation.

66
00:04:55,373 --> 00:04:59,149
I'll prove to you that I can invent
a good reason for it, whatever it is.

67
00:04:59,891 --> 00:05:01,683
This is a dream come true!

68
00:05:03,664 --> 00:05:07,411
This is the perfect opportunity to show
her that she can't actually rely on me.

69
00:05:07,436 --> 00:05:08,405
All right, then.

70
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,240
What should I pick for you?

71
00:05:13,872 --> 00:05:18,026
Anyone who was shopping at Kobundo
near the train station on October 31st,

72
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:21,633
please report to Shibazaki in
the faculty room immediately.

73
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:28,053
What is that all about?

74
00:05:28,335 --> 00:05:29,244
No clue.

75
00:05:31,796 --> 00:05:33,788
Let's make that the situation!

76
00:05:34,147 --> 00:05:37,247
Please deduce why that announcement was made just now!

77
00:05:37,549 --> 00:05:39,543
So what's the story behind it?

78
00:05:40,623 --> 00:05:41,706
Okay, fine.

79
00:05:41,794 --> 00:05:43,123
Challenge accepted.

80
00:05:48,734 --> 00:05:50,020
Right. Here ya go.

81
00:05:53,063 --> 00:05:56,670
Your power of recollection is as intimidating as ever.

82
00:05:56,724 --> 00:05:58,226
That's no compliment.

83
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,457
Let's see...

84
00:06:00,767 --> 00:06:05,369
"Anyone who was shopping at Kobundo
near the train station on October 31st,

85
00:06:05,456 --> 00:06:09,104
please report to Shibazaki in
the faculty room immediately."

86
00:06:10,231 --> 00:06:12,371
First thing we should do is a word check.

87
00:06:12,981 --> 00:06:15,119
Do you know what this "Kobundo" is?

88
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:18,971
Yes. It's a little stationery
store across from the train station.

89
00:06:21,206 --> 00:06:24,169
It's very quaint, and it's run by a sweet elderly couple.

90
00:06:24,224 --> 00:06:25,773
I've only been there once, though.

91
00:06:26,248 --> 00:06:27,581
What kind of stationery?

92
00:06:27,733 --> 00:06:28,990
Oh, the usual.

93
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:34,107
North Elementary is nearby, so I think
they might specialize in the kinds of things

94
00:06:34,132 --> 00:06:35,672
grade-schoolers would use.

95
00:06:36,114 --> 00:06:39,731
So it's not the kind of place where
high-schoolers would go out of their way to shop?

96
00:06:39,856 --> 00:06:41,614
I suppose you could say that.

97
00:06:42,542 --> 00:06:44,500
Is Shibazaki on the faculty here?

98
00:06:44,633 --> 00:06:47,352
Oreki, Mr. Shibazaki is the vice principal.

99
00:06:48,258 --> 00:06:52,164
For all your deductive prowess, you're not
good with remembering people's names, huh?

100
00:06:52,228 --> 00:06:53,520
Leave me alone.

101
00:06:56,164 --> 00:06:58,706
"If I don't have to, I'm not going to.

102
00:06:58,838 --> 00:07:01,572
If I have to, I'll do it as quickly as possible."

103
00:07:01,747 --> 00:07:03,716
That was my unshakeable creed.

104
00:07:03,814 --> 00:07:06,459
But the stakes of this contest are high.

105
00:07:07,149 --> 00:07:10,184
I'm going to have to turn up
the heat a little on this one.

106
00:07:10,752 --> 00:07:11,790
First off...

107
00:07:11,853 --> 00:07:12,456
Yes?

108
00:07:12,855 --> 00:07:15,914
I've deduced why Shibazaki would
be calling people in to see him.

109
00:07:16,072 --> 00:07:18,836
Yes. I have a pretty good idea of that myself.

110
00:07:19,059 --> 00:07:23,174
Just to make things clearer, let's refer
to the student who's been called out as "X."

111
00:07:27,186 --> 00:07:29,189
Now we're getting into the swing of things.

112
00:07:35,522 --> 00:07:37,022
Why don't you have a seat?

113
00:07:37,185 --> 00:07:38,016
Okay.

114
00:07:45,376 --> 00:07:50,885
At this point, with the information we have, there's no
way to know whether X is a single kid or multiple people.

115
00:07:54,505 --> 00:07:55,713
Could be anything.

116
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:57,130
A teaching moment.

117
00:07:57,384 --> 00:08:00,745
He could be trying to teach X a
lesson about something that happened.

118
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:04,336
In other words, he could be calling X
to the faculty room to chew them out.

119
00:08:04,503 --> 00:08:06,364
What makes you so certain about that?

120
00:08:06,498 --> 00:08:11,153
Because when students are called down to the
faculty room, it's very rarely for something good.

121
00:08:11,814 --> 00:08:13,950
That's what you call inductive reasoning.

122
00:08:15,647 --> 00:08:17,939
Oreki, are you taking this seriously?

123
00:08:18,089 --> 00:08:21,609
I haven't been this serious about
something since I started at Kami High.

124
00:08:21,731 --> 00:08:25,056
I'd go so far as to say I haven't
been this serious my whole life.

125
00:08:25,606 --> 00:08:29,139
Besides, if he was summoning X to
the faculty room to offer praise,

126
00:08:29,164 --> 00:08:31,094
he wouldn't put it in such vague terms.

127
00:08:31,221 --> 00:08:32,925
he would just say that's what was going on.

128
00:08:33,052 --> 00:08:34,902
And he would have called the person out by name.

129
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:39,238
With an announcement like that, anyone
involved would be too anxious to answer it.

130
00:08:39,522 --> 00:08:41,356
You're right, that's a good point.

131
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:44,109
Furthermore, that sounded like an urgent page.

132
00:08:44,275 --> 00:08:45,920
You mean 'cause he said, "immediately"?

133
00:08:45,981 --> 00:08:47,897
No, most pages use that word.

134
00:08:48,018 --> 00:08:49,074
It's not that.

135
00:08:49,914 --> 00:08:54,367
This announcement deviated from the standard
pattern, so we can deduce that they made it hastily.

136
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:56,859
Standard pattern? How so?

137
00:08:57,004 --> 00:09:01,698
Let's say you wanted to make an announcement
addressing me, asking me to come to Class 1-A.

138
00:09:01,856 --> 00:09:02,856
What would you say?

139
00:09:03,034 --> 00:09:04,616
Well, let me see...

140
00:09:05,064 --> 00:09:06,633
Something like this:

141
00:09:06,897 --> 00:09:08,350
"Attention, students:

142
00:09:08,469 --> 00:09:13,672
Would Hotaro Oreki of class 1-B please
report to Eru Chitanda in the 1-A classroom."

143
00:09:14,356 --> 00:09:15,439
Is that really all?

144
00:09:15,603 --> 00:09:18,240
Try to think of other
announcements you've heard this year.

145
00:09:20,897 --> 00:09:22,648
If it were me, I'd say:

146
00:09:22,863 --> 00:09:28,417
"Attention: would Eru Chitanda of Class 1-A
please report to Hotaro Oreki in Class 1-B at once.

147
00:09:29,621 --> 00:09:30,537
I repeat.

148
00:09:30,689 --> 00:09:32,732
Would Eru Chitanda of Class 1-A

149
00:09:32,788 --> 00:09:37,085
please report to Hotaro Oreki
in the 1-B classroom at once."

150
00:09:37,386 --> 00:09:39,049
It's not like a regular announcement.

151
00:09:39,152 --> 00:09:41,448
Usually summons like that are repeated somehow.

152
00:09:42,872 --> 00:09:46,046
But for whatever reason, he
only made this announcement once.

153
00:09:46,643 --> 00:09:49,081
I think it's safe to conclude he was in a rush.

154
00:09:51,998 --> 00:09:54,580
It's not just any run-of-the-mill rush, either.

155
00:09:54,747 --> 00:09:55,811
It's not?

156
00:09:56,206 --> 00:09:58,206
I know that because of when we heard it.

157
00:09:58,313 --> 00:10:00,347
He made the announcement after school.

158
00:10:00,606 --> 00:10:02,532
Hmm... I don't know.

159
00:10:02,587 --> 00:10:05,242
That seems pretty insignificant, if you ask me.

160
00:10:05,455 --> 00:10:06,234
Oh, yeah?

161
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:08,134
Then I won't say why I think that.

162
00:10:08,229 --> 00:10:10,469
Oreki, come on!

163
00:10:11,797 --> 00:10:12,988
It's just a bit odd.

164
00:10:13,139 --> 00:10:14,731
Why make that announcement after school?

165
00:10:14,894 --> 00:10:17,167
Why not make it earlier in the day?

166
00:10:17,476 --> 00:10:21,076
Sure, Kamiyama may have a ton of
after-school clubs and activities,

167
00:10:21,101 --> 00:10:23,500
but there are still plenty of
students here who leave right away.

168
00:10:23,647 --> 00:10:26,270
That makes me think he made the announcement after school

169
00:10:26,294 --> 00:10:29,569
because the event that caused the
announcement happened after school, too.

170
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:33,789
And it was urgent enough that he couldn't
risk waiting to summon X until tomorrow.

171
00:10:34,568 --> 00:10:39,486
So that means Shibazaki followed his impulse and
took the gamble that X hadn't gone home from school yet.

172
00:10:40,911 --> 00:10:42,077
I gotta say...

173
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:44,762
This whole thing feels incredibly shady to me.

174
00:10:44,968 --> 00:10:45,929
Yeah, me, too.

175
00:10:45,954 --> 00:10:48,693
And the term "shady," how did
it come to mean what it does?

176
00:10:48,749 --> 00:10:49,352
Dunno.

177
00:10:50,939 --> 00:10:52,070
Next deduction...

178
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:54,818
Whatever Shibazaki wants to speak to X about,

179
00:10:54,843 --> 00:10:57,003
that subject can't be discussed out in the open.

180
00:10:57,735 --> 00:11:01,272
Whether that's just for now or
forever, we have no way of knowing.

181
00:11:01,469 --> 00:11:05,481
Do you figure that because Shibazaki
didn't give a reason for making the page?

182
00:11:05,734 --> 00:11:06,712
That's a factor,

183
00:11:06,808 --> 00:11:08,825
but there's an even clearer reason I think so.

184
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,474
It's not clear to me.

185
00:11:13,664 --> 00:11:15,981
Shibazaki is the vice-principal, right?

186
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,189
The guidance counselor is usually
the one who comes down on students.

187
00:11:19,272 --> 00:11:20,218
That's right.

188
00:11:20,323 --> 00:11:22,856
Morishita is always the one to call students in.

189
00:11:23,286 --> 00:11:25,411
Where is the guidance counselor's office?

190
00:11:25,501 --> 00:11:27,814
It's on the second floor of the main building.

191
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:32,700
But Shibazaki summoned X to the faculty
room, and not the guidance counselor's office.

192
00:11:33,444 --> 00:11:36,427
To me, that means the circumstances were serious.

193
00:11:36,522 --> 00:11:41,146
And that all information about this incident
was to be kept between the administration only.

194
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,497
Or so it could be argued.

195
00:11:47,314 --> 00:11:48,897
Listen... Oreki...

196
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:49,789
What is it?

197
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:53,588
Judging by what you've deduced
about this situation so far,

198
00:11:53,736 --> 00:11:57,647
I can't escape the feeling that X was
involved in doing something really bad.

199
00:11:58,154 --> 00:12:00,562
Well, that's what all the signs point to.

200
00:12:01,863 --> 00:12:02,904
So then...

201
00:12:05,242 --> 00:12:06,481
Student X...

202
00:12:07,786 --> 00:12:09,786
...committed some kind of crime.

203
00:12:21,272 --> 00:12:23,562
This is only a game between Chitanda and me.

204
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:26,178
My explanation doesn't have to match up with the truth.

205
00:12:26,368 --> 00:12:29,624
I mean, the whole point of this was to
prove that my assessments are only right

206
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:31,898
when I have a good deal of luck on my side.

207
00:12:32,462 --> 00:12:35,099
So, then... What crime could X have committed?

208
00:12:35,124 --> 00:12:36,157
Before we get to that,

209
00:12:36,284 --> 00:12:38,365
if we assume that my deductions are accurate,

210
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:41,003
we have to note that the school
doesn't have a police officer,

211
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:45,657
so it's likely that law enforcement has been
summoned here to talk to X about what went down.

212
00:12:45,914 --> 00:12:49,940
If a crime was committed, it
must have happened on October 31st.

213
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:54,771
And yet the announcement came a few
minutes ago, and seemed really hurried.

214
00:12:56,147 --> 00:13:00,794
It's conceivable that the page followed
immediately after some request from law enforcement.

215
00:13:00,897 --> 00:13:04,059
But that could have been done
relatively easily over the phone.

216
00:13:04,244 --> 00:13:05,286
That may be true,

217
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:08,444
but if worse came to worse, and
it was decided that X was guilty,

218
00:13:08,481 --> 00:13:10,748
the police might have to take X into custody.

219
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:13,949
They could have come to the school
just in case that became necessary.

220
00:13:15,062 --> 00:13:16,166
Custody?

221
00:13:16,581 --> 00:13:20,710
Do you mean if X is found guilty
that they would face criminal charges?

222
00:13:20,911 --> 00:13:22,267
Well, it's possible.

223
00:13:24,597 --> 00:13:26,924
Hey. It's a game, remember?

224
00:13:27,249 --> 00:13:29,840
Oh. Right. I keep forgetting.

225
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:31,955
If X weren't the culprit,

226
00:13:32,022 --> 00:13:35,688
Shibazaki would have waited to make the
announcement, and he wouldn't have sounded so rushed.

227
00:13:35,775 --> 00:13:36,831
That makes sense.

228
00:13:36,914 --> 00:13:40,564
Now as far as what crime we may be
dealing with here, do you have any ideas?

229
00:13:40,669 --> 00:13:43,019
It must have to do with the store somehow.

230
00:13:43,687 --> 00:13:45,469
Well, let's see... Uh...

231
00:13:45,508 --> 00:13:47,454
Shoplifting is the obvious choice.

232
00:13:48,203 --> 00:13:49,139
Beyond that,

233
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:53,772
it's possible that someone had committed crimes
at other locations, but police received a testimony

234
00:13:53,797 --> 00:13:57,663
that someone of that suspect's description
had been seen shopping at Kobundo,

235
00:13:57,831 --> 00:13:59,206
but if that's the case,

236
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:01,811
the crime could have been any number of heinous acts.

237
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:03,352
It could have been anything!

238
00:14:03,955 --> 00:14:06,855
That's a detailed answer for having been put on the spot.

239
00:14:07,581 --> 00:14:10,831
Considering the announcement, I doubt
anyone gave a physical description.

240
00:14:10,924 --> 00:14:11,900
Why's that?

241
00:14:12,606 --> 00:14:15,699
If the police had a description of
someone who had committed a crime,

242
00:14:15,785 --> 00:14:17,796
they would probably share it with Shibazaki.

243
00:14:17,859 --> 00:14:21,150
He would have been able to think of at
least one name, and wouldn't just have said,

244
00:14:21,189 --> 00:14:24,064
"anyone who was shopping at Kobundo" in the announcement.

245
00:14:24,206 --> 00:14:25,542
That's a good point.

246
00:14:25,915 --> 00:14:27,838
The incident occurred at Kobundo,

247
00:14:27,925 --> 00:14:32,017
and all we know for sure was that X
was shopping there on October 31st.

248
00:14:36,546 --> 00:14:39,699
Was the purpose of the announcement
to make X turn themselves in?

249
00:14:39,814 --> 00:14:42,433
If that's the case, it's kind of a weird way to do it.

250
00:14:43,345 --> 00:14:44,658
I speculate...

251
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:48,066
...that law enforcement doesn't know very much about X,

252
00:14:48,091 --> 00:14:51,610
but they assume that the announcement
will lead X to confess their crimes.

253
00:14:51,863 --> 00:14:53,078
Why would that be?

254
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:56,980
If I had done something wrong, and
that page came over the PA system...

255
00:15:00,272 --> 00:15:04,424
Anyone who was shopping at Kobundo
near the train station on October 31st,

256
00:15:04,449 --> 00:15:07,937
please report to Shibazaki in
the faculty room immediately.

257
00:15:07,962 --> 00:15:09,351
Ten more seconds.

258
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:10,709
Good.

259
00:15:10,821 --> 00:15:12,731
The police still don't know I'm the one who did it.

260
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:18,176
If all goes according to plan, I could get away
with it and go on to become a criminal mastermind!

261
00:15:21,189 --> 00:15:25,487
Why would a guilty party ever come forward
just because they heard an announcement like that?

262
00:15:26,205 --> 00:15:28,872
If they had some sense of remorse about the crime?

263
00:15:28,897 --> 00:15:33,000
No, if that were the case, they'd have turned
themselves in already, and wouldn't be at large.

264
00:15:39,731 --> 00:15:40,856
What are you thinking?

265
00:15:40,939 --> 00:15:44,467
Let's forget about the nature of the
crime for a moment, and try another tactic.

266
00:15:44,578 --> 00:15:47,019
Now suppose X felt guilty about what they had done.

267
00:15:47,162 --> 00:15:49,991
Maybe they decided to apologize to the owners of Kobundo.

268
00:15:50,547 --> 00:15:51,789
In writing.

269
00:15:51,968 --> 00:15:53,231
Wait, in writing?

270
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:54,295
Chitanda.

271
00:15:54,414 --> 00:15:56,177
Do you know the date off the top of your head?

272
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,655
Of course. It's November 1st.

273
00:15:58,798 --> 00:16:00,516
So the crime was committed yesterday,

274
00:16:00,595 --> 00:16:02,207
October 31st, right?

275
00:16:02,414 --> 00:16:04,122
Why didn't Shibazaki say,

276
00:16:04,528 --> 00:16:08,039
"Kobundo next to the train station
yesterday," in his announcement?

277
00:16:08,248 --> 00:16:10,931
Now that you mention it, that is quite unusual.

278
00:16:11,209 --> 00:16:15,032
Why would someone spell out October
31st instead of saying "yesterday"?

279
00:16:15,206 --> 00:16:18,742
One explanation could be that they have
some sort of form or note in front of them

280
00:16:18,805 --> 00:16:22,030
on which all that is written out, and
they are reading the date directly from it.

281
00:16:22,289 --> 00:16:23,978
A form or a note, huh?

282
00:16:24,097 --> 00:16:24,676
Yeah.

283
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:30,325
Furthermore, why do the police know that X was
involved in a crime, but have no idea what X looks like?

284
00:16:31,162 --> 00:16:34,623
Why would they assume that X would
come forward just because they were paged?

285
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:38,318
To put it another way, why would
they think X felt remorse for the crime?

286
00:16:38,485 --> 00:16:41,734
It has to be that X sent an apology note to Kobundo.

287
00:16:42,273 --> 00:16:44,482
It probably went something like this:

288
00:16:44,657 --> 00:16:45,939
"I am terribly sorry.

289
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:50,347
I was shopping in your store on October
31st and committed an unlawful act.

290
00:16:50,455 --> 00:16:55,843
I intend to pay for the damage I caused, so
please accept such and such and my sincere apology."

291
00:16:56,025 --> 00:16:59,324
Kobundo then takes that apology
note directly to the police.

292
00:16:59,499 --> 00:17:02,539
Either the police or other law
enforcement follows up on the letter,

293
00:17:02,622 --> 00:17:04,337
and decides to come to Kami High.

294
00:17:04,497 --> 00:17:06,497
That just happened, mere moments ago.

295
00:17:06,632 --> 00:17:11,057
Then Shibazaki reads the note and is so outraged
that he makes a hasty schoolwide announcement,

296
00:17:11,082 --> 00:17:12,956
summoning the suspect to the faculty room.

297
00:17:13,028 --> 00:17:13,986
Hold on a minute.

298
00:17:14,157 --> 00:17:17,731
Oreki, by your logic, even though
X wanted to apologize to Kobundo

299
00:17:17,805 --> 00:17:20,981
and repay them for the damage, they hoped
by writing the letter that they could settle

300
00:17:21,038 --> 00:17:23,222
without any police involvement, right?

301
00:17:23,564 --> 00:17:24,856
Yeah, that makes sense.

302
00:17:24,998 --> 00:17:27,988
In that case, I don't think X
would have indicated in their letter

303
00:17:28,013 --> 00:17:30,532
that they were a student at Kamiyama High, would they?

304
00:17:31,122 --> 00:17:34,209
So then how would the police
have known to look for them here?

305
00:17:36,153 --> 00:17:40,098
Maybe when police asked the owners of Kobundo
for a physical description of the suspect,

306
00:17:40,123 --> 00:17:44,414
they detailed X's clothes, and police put
together that it was the uniform for Kami High.

307
00:17:44,595 --> 00:17:46,689
That would be one possible explanation.

308
00:17:46,787 --> 00:17:47,734
Interesting.

309
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:52,492
And if X did anything that made them stand out, it
would make sense for the owners to remember details.

310
00:17:52,705 --> 00:17:54,319
What would make them stand out?

311
00:17:54,398 --> 00:17:55,249
Well, let's see.

312
00:17:55,336 --> 00:17:57,561
We might be able to determine the crime from that.

313
00:17:57,672 --> 00:17:59,309
So, X behaved oddly.

314
00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:04,742
They did something outrageous enough to attract
attention, but that's not necessarily illegal.

315
00:18:05,429 --> 00:18:06,919
Then X committed a crime,

316
00:18:07,014 --> 00:18:11,383
the nature of which is such that, without the
apology letter, no one would have known right away.

317
00:18:12,952 --> 00:18:14,792
X was consumed with regret.

318
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,353
X's crime was serious enough that it
warranted contacting law enforcement immediately.

319
00:18:20,591 --> 00:18:22,064
Whatever X did yesterday...

320
00:18:22,244 --> 00:18:24,452
It wasn't something petty, like shoplifting.

321
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,627
Then, what?

322
00:18:32,272 --> 00:18:34,146
Shopping in a way that stood out.

323
00:18:35,053 --> 00:18:36,917
Shopping that became illegal.

324
00:18:39,064 --> 00:18:42,622
You said that Kobundo is a stationery
store that caters to grade school kids,

325
00:18:42,702 --> 00:18:45,356
so it's not likely that they carry anything of much value.

326
00:18:45,642 --> 00:18:49,867
Shopping... shopping... shopping.

327
00:19:07,939 --> 00:19:08,866
No way.

328
00:19:09,665 --> 00:19:10,558
What is it?

329
00:19:10,789 --> 00:19:15,173
Our friend, X, tried to pay
with a counterfeit 10,000 yen bill.

330
00:19:19,122 --> 00:19:20,622
But... But...

331
00:19:20,727 --> 00:19:22,141
But that can't be true!

332
00:19:22,237 --> 00:19:23,814
It's just way too far-fetched.

333
00:19:23,956 --> 00:19:25,581
I don't think it's realistic!

334
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:27,606
It defies any sort of logic!

335
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:30,976
It's a terrible theory! It's completely catastrophic!

336
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,938
Whoa. Hey.

337
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,593
Calm down.

338
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:39,929
This is just a game, you know?

339
00:19:43,904 --> 00:19:45,426
Right. I'm sorry.

340
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:53,311
It's not real. Don't take it so seriously.

341
00:19:53,568 --> 00:19:54,735
I know, but still...

342
00:19:54,804 --> 00:19:56,742
It's not possible... It can't be.

343
00:19:57,481 --> 00:19:59,521
Why are you so sure it's impossible?

344
00:19:59,743 --> 00:20:03,773
It's been all over the news that someone
has been trying to pass off 10,000 yen bills.

345
00:20:03,836 --> 00:20:05,568
That's what gave you the idea in the first place:

346
00:20:05,593 --> 00:20:09,311
That X must be someone from our school who
tried to pay with one of them yesterday, right?

347
00:20:09,596 --> 00:20:10,091
Yeah.

348
00:20:10,171 --> 00:20:13,585
But X could not have possibly gotten
ahold of one of those counterfeit bills,

349
00:20:13,649 --> 00:20:17,422
or even if they had, they would have realized
it was fake and handed it over to the police.

350
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:18,519
What makes you say that?

351
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:19,783
Bear with me here.

352
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:21,603
Let's say X did get a counterfeit bill.

353
00:20:21,647 --> 00:20:23,493
Where do you think they could have done that?

354
00:20:23,572 --> 00:20:25,256
From an ATM, I would imagine.

355
00:20:25,873 --> 00:20:30,840
Counterfeit bills that are good enough to slip
past bank tellers into an ATM aren't very common.

356
00:20:31,161 --> 00:20:33,202
And even if by some chance that happened,

357
00:20:33,296 --> 00:20:35,663
the bill would be so good that X wouldn't spot it.

358
00:20:35,728 --> 00:20:38,188
If X was given change, Oh.

359
00:20:39,897 --> 00:20:40,883
That's right.

360
00:20:41,622 --> 00:20:44,122
You can't get 10,000 yen bills as change.

361
00:20:44,235 --> 00:20:48,065
Except for commemorative coins, the
10,000 is the highest note there is here.

362
00:20:48,657 --> 00:20:50,513
I think I see what you're getting at now.

363
00:20:50,585 --> 00:20:55,598
That means there's only one or two other ways in
which X could have acquired a fake bill innocently.

364
00:20:56,256 --> 00:21:00,881
But even if we assume X's parents own their own
business, and had a counterfeit bill given to them

365
00:21:00,921 --> 00:21:01,954
without their knowledge,

366
00:21:02,018 --> 00:21:04,052
if X had gotten it as allowance or something,

367
00:21:04,171 --> 00:21:07,253
X would have had the chance to
tell his or her parents it was a fake.

368
00:21:07,492 --> 00:21:08,723
I think you're right.

369
00:21:08,798 --> 00:21:13,625
And if X had earned it at a part-time job or something,
they would have had a chance to turn it in then, as well.

370
00:21:16,128 --> 00:21:17,255
What if X found it?

371
00:21:17,528 --> 00:21:19,137
That would be too crazy!

372
00:21:19,706 --> 00:21:22,047
Yeah, someone who would find a counterfeit bill

373
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:26,035
and try to pass it off as real doesn't seem
like the kind to write an apology letter, do they?

374
00:21:26,273 --> 00:21:30,268
X probably noticed at the last minute and
felt guilty as they were trying to pay with it.

375
00:21:30,665 --> 00:21:35,988
Without knowing how X obtained a counterfeit bill, it's
impossible to say whether your deduction is realistic.

376
00:21:40,731 --> 00:21:42,758
A 10,000 yen note.

377
00:21:43,085 --> 00:21:45,681
Chitanda. Would you say that you like money?

378
00:21:46,955 --> 00:21:48,081
I'm not sure.

379
00:21:48,177 --> 00:21:51,569
I suppose it's fair to say I
like it more than I dislike it.

380
00:21:51,789 --> 00:21:54,326
If you dropped 10,000 yen, would you miss it?

381
00:21:54,477 --> 00:21:55,773
Yeah, of course I would.

382
00:21:55,844 --> 00:21:59,301
Well... Unless I knew my money wasn't the genuine article.

383
00:22:00,122 --> 00:22:03,518
If it was your own, real money,
then I bet you would miss it for sure.

384
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:08,530
The reason X felt guilty, even while committing
the crime, is that it was their own money.

385
00:22:08,564 --> 00:22:09,780
Even if it was a fake.

386
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:15,388
I submit that X must have gotten that bill
from someone, thinking it was legitimate currency,

387
00:22:15,595 --> 00:22:19,114
and if that wasn't from wages or
allowance, there's only one other possibility.

388
00:22:19,439 --> 00:22:22,093
Someone gave it to them when they repaid a loan.

389
00:22:22,414 --> 00:22:25,683
If X had gotten the bill in that
manner, and discovered it was a fake,

390
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:27,242
they'd have been really disappointed.

391
00:22:27,329 --> 00:22:31,675
That being the case, it's hard to blame them for
trying to use it at a store run by an old man and woman.

392
00:22:31,785 --> 00:22:33,978
Even if they knew it was immoral to do that.

393
00:22:35,689 --> 00:22:40,113
Even so, they still would have had the opportunity
to turn it in and exchange it for real money!

394
00:22:40,193 --> 00:22:41,102
I don't know.

395
00:22:41,272 --> 00:22:43,552
A fake bill is like the joker in Old Maid.

396
00:22:43,655 --> 00:22:45,141
No one wants to get stuck with it.

397
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:49,290
You know, the longer I think about
this, the more plausible it sounds to me.

398
00:22:49,664 --> 00:22:52,674
"Hey, X, I have the money that I
borrowed from you a while back."

399
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,034
"Ah, Y, that's great. I appreciate it."

400
00:22:55,097 --> 00:22:57,893
"It was 10,000 yen, right? Here ya go."

401
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,100
"Yes, thank you."

402
00:22:59,657 --> 00:23:01,782
Then, surprise, it's a fake bill.

403
00:23:03,873 --> 00:23:08,602
Maybe Y, who borrowed the money from X,
had seniority over X, complicating things.

404
00:23:08,627 --> 00:23:12,616
So X didn't feel like they could object
when Y paid them back with a counterfeit note.

405
00:23:12,894 --> 00:23:16,303
At this point, I think it's safe
to say that X is just one person.

406
00:23:16,533 --> 00:23:20,567
And since Kobundo is a store that sells
inexpensive stationery for grade school kids,

407
00:23:20,592 --> 00:23:24,612
it would be weird for high schoolers to
come in buying things with 10,000 yen bills.

408
00:23:25,939 --> 00:23:27,464
I think that wraps that up.

409
00:23:27,689 --> 00:23:28,790
Then there's Y.

410
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,914
Y also came across a fake bill.

411
00:23:31,007 --> 00:23:34,074
It could be that Z, someone above Y, gave it to them.

412
00:23:35,061 --> 00:23:38,976
If we lump everyone above Y together
as one collective, then who are they?

413
00:23:39,789 --> 00:23:43,966
A store manager somewhere with no
conscience, or the counterfeiter themselves?

414
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:46,414
The police may have gotten involved at Kami

415
00:23:46,548 --> 00:23:49,971
in the hope that they could find out from
X specifically where the counterfeit bills

416
00:23:49,996 --> 00:23:51,855
were originating. That's my guess.

417
00:23:52,449 --> 00:23:54,532
And that concludes my deduction.

418
00:24:01,506 --> 00:24:02,184
Hmm...

419
00:24:02,573 --> 00:24:06,092
After I talked for so long, it seems
kind of rude of her not to respond.

420
00:24:06,692 --> 00:24:07,418
Whatever.

421
00:24:18,106 --> 00:24:20,053
Kobundo is over that way, isn't it?

422
00:24:22,189 --> 00:24:23,500
That's amazing.

423
00:24:24,123 --> 00:24:28,394
"Anyone who was shopping at Kobundo
near the train station on October 31st,

424
00:24:28,521 --> 00:24:32,017
please report to Shibazaki in
the faculty room immediately."

425
00:24:34,012 --> 00:24:37,545
A whole story. Wow. Just from that one announcement.

426
00:24:38,164 --> 00:24:39,873
Yeah, that's what we came up with.

427
00:24:40,142 --> 00:24:41,350
Game over, I guess.

428
00:24:44,147 --> 00:24:45,196
Hey, Oreki.

429
00:24:45,382 --> 00:24:46,944
Huh? What is it?

430
00:24:47,664 --> 00:24:52,585
I seem to remember that we started this whole game as a
way to settle an argument we were having about something.

431
00:24:52,747 --> 00:24:54,789
Oh, that rings a bell.

432
00:24:54,945 --> 00:24:56,194
Now what was it, again?

433
00:24:56,385 --> 00:24:57,719
I can't recall.

434
00:25:00,064 --> 00:25:04,138
Oh, Oreki... I have an idea.

435
00:25:04,814 --> 00:25:06,814
Do you want to deduce what it was?

436
00:25:13,259 --> 00:25:14,433
Give me a break.

437
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:25,374
Whoa...

438
00:25:26,225 --> 00:25:28,370
But that was supposed to be a game.

439
00:25:28,644 --> 00:25:29,537
I thought...

440
00:25:30,208 --> 00:25:33,120
It couldn't possibly be true. Hmm.

441
00:27:06,357 --> 00:27:07,178
Next time:

442
00:27:07,364 --> 00:27:09,070
"Mishap-py New Year."
