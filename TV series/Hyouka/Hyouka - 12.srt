386
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:38,809
Oh.

399
00:24:26,639 --> 00:24:27,336
Me?

17
00:03:54,391 --> 00:03:55,064
Hey.

194
00:12:16,391 --> 00:12:17,064
Yes!

204
00:12:37,766 --> 00:12:38,460
Yes.

375
00:23:16,349 --> 00:23:16,952
Yep!

392
00:23:53,801 --> 00:23:54,604
Nah.

70
00:06:14,642 --> 00:06:15,349
Whoa!

99
00:07:45,141 --> 00:07:45,778
Sure.

142
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:57,634
Yeah.

212
00:12:53,548 --> 00:12:54,167
Okay!

238
00:15:06,932 --> 00:15:07,476
What?

328
00:20:20,366 --> 00:20:20,996
What?

336
00:20:36,597 --> 00:20:37,990
Yeah!

360
00:22:42,141 --> 00:22:42,743
Oh...

28
00:04:16,557 --> 00:04:17,255
Catch!

162
00:10:49,057 --> 00:10:50,067
Man...

211
00:12:50,891 --> 00:12:51,544
Right!

219
00:13:07,316 --> 00:13:09,099
Three!

220
00:13:09,253 --> 00:13:10,891
Three.

342
00:21:10,632 --> 00:21:11,843
I win.

112
00:08:31,171 --> 00:08:32,833
Galaxy!

231
00:14:31,224 --> 00:14:32,693
No way!

242
00:15:32,832 --> 00:15:33,282
Got it!

244
00:15:36,063 --> 00:15:36,633
Got it!

249
00:15:53,955 --> 00:15:54,406
Got it!

350
00:22:07,432 --> 00:22:08,134
Not me.

390
00:23:49,474 --> 00:23:50,178
Thanks.

81
00:06:49,608 --> 00:06:50,490
Amazing!

203
00:12:36,403 --> 00:12:37,117
My role?

300
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,895
Sure do.

306
00:19:26,099 --> 00:19:26,728
Come on!

359
00:22:40,267 --> 00:22:41,090
Nothing.

58
00:05:42,492 --> 00:05:43,533
I'm Frol.

61
00:05:51,307 --> 00:05:52,125
Oh, yeah?

247
00:15:49,266 --> 00:15:50,209
One game?

261
00:16:54,932 --> 00:16:55,589
Listen...

280
00:17:47,349 --> 00:17:48,191
Say what?

315
00:19:44,182 --> 00:19:44,911
Oh, good.

394
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:57,949
Oh, well.

12
00:01:58,922 --> 00:01:59,721
All right.

193
00:12:15,523 --> 00:12:16,307
You think?

206
00:12:42,155 --> 00:12:43,910
Oh, right.

223
00:13:20,429 --> 00:13:21,134
Hey, look!

224
00:13:21,925 --> 00:13:22,251
The bunny?

255
00:16:37,808 --> 00:16:39,206
Excuse me.

295
00:18:53,214 --> 00:18:55,033
Oh. Ibara.

355
00:22:31,612 --> 00:22:33,040
Excuse me.

379
00:23:22,687 --> 00:23:23,801
Oh, sorry.

416
00:27:06,474 --> 00:27:07,246
Next time:

1
00:00:07,321 --> 00:00:08,408
I wonder...

53
00:05:29,343 --> 00:05:30,421
Cut it out.

56
00:05:37,952 --> 00:05:39,119
Roger that.

72
00:06:22,807 --> 00:06:23,850
No kidding!

97
00:07:42,932 --> 00:07:43,634
It sure is.

128
00:09:15,099 --> 00:09:15,677
You know...

182
00:11:46,045 --> 00:11:47,381
Oh! Also...

288
00:18:08,855 --> 00:18:09,619
Just a sec.

51
00:05:23,692 --> 00:05:25,009
Same to you.

104
00:08:02,981 --> 00:08:04,265
Indubitably.

111
00:08:25,345 --> 00:08:26,525
There's 200.

296
00:18:55,349 --> 00:18:56,003
You're here.

320
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:01,217
You're sure?

348
00:22:04,664 --> 00:22:05,348
What the...?

404
00:24:54,391 --> 00:24:55,391
Occult Club!

16
00:03:53,113 --> 00:03:54,287
Good morning!

20
00:03:58,999 --> 00:03:59,632
That's right.

88
00:07:16,932 --> 00:07:18,294
It sure is...

126
00:09:09,474 --> 00:09:10,264
That's right!

132
00:09:28,257 --> 00:09:29,410
Thanks, guys.

149
00:10:13,266 --> 00:10:13,825
That's great.

226
00:13:23,986 --> 00:13:25,138
This is lame.

312
00:19:37,682 --> 00:19:38,571
Good morning.

334
00:20:32,826 --> 00:20:33,827
An old manga.

376
00:23:17,474 --> 00:23:18,613
It's perfect!

37
00:04:41,982 --> 00:04:43,077
No, stay away!

39
00:04:48,682 --> 00:04:49,925
Apparently so.

109
00:08:20,654 --> 00:08:22,156
Thirty copies.

341
00:21:08,974 --> 00:21:10,190
This is great.

365
00:22:53,309 --> 00:22:54,356
Is he serious?

398
00:24:23,277 --> 00:24:24,604
Hey, gorgeous!

35
00:04:35,027 --> 00:04:36,275
Fine, whatever.

85
00:07:01,484 --> 00:07:02,442
Just for a few.

117
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,116
No, not at all.

169
00:11:11,363 --> 00:11:12,780
That's amazing!

368
00:23:00,269 --> 00:23:01,642
That's 200 yen.

371
00:23:08,283 --> 00:23:09,795
Whoa! Hey, man!

374
00:23:14,968 --> 00:23:16,030
This old thing?

397
00:24:19,005 --> 00:24:20,141
I did it again!

63
00:05:55,474 --> 00:05:56,599
You'll find out.

138
00:09:48,224 --> 00:09:49,218
Two hundred yen.

216
00:13:01,668 --> 00:13:02,960
All copies sold!

218
00:13:06,141 --> 00:13:07,220
One! Two! Three!

268
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:21,973
Oh, I guess not.

311
00:19:36,849 --> 00:19:37,599
Nice to see you!

377
00:23:18,655 --> 00:23:19,739
What great luck!

383
00:23:32,907 --> 00:23:33,795
You can have it.

84
00:07:00,305 --> 00:07:01,293
Handicrafts Club?

93
00:07:34,343 --> 00:07:35,718
Oh, good morning!

152
00:10:19,859 --> 00:10:21,036
Yeah, good point.

227
00:13:36,933 --> 00:13:38,366
I hereby declare,

273
00:17:32,694 --> 00:17:33,811
Do you mean that?

287
00:18:05,363 --> 00:18:06,440
Sorry about that.

297
00:18:56,162 --> 00:18:57,599
Hi, there, Kochi.

378
00:23:19,974 --> 00:23:21,131
Are you for real?

23
00:04:03,156 --> 00:04:04,865
I have my methods.

79
00:06:44,788 --> 00:06:45,382
Hey, are you done?

102
00:07:57,275 --> 00:07:58,132
On the other hand,

160
00:10:40,686 --> 00:10:42,417
Look. Right there.

161
00:10:46,099 --> 00:10:47,184
I didn't see that.

208
00:12:45,849 --> 00:12:47,016
Yeah, that's true.

250
00:15:56,306 --> 00:15:57,402
Here's your medal!

308
00:19:31,985 --> 00:19:33,678
Hey. Good morning.

3
00:00:44,755 --> 00:00:46,231
Tomorrow's the day.

6
00:01:07,825 --> 00:01:09,714
Hmm... now, then...

76
00:06:39,716 --> 00:06:40,974
Yeah, you're right.

87
00:07:14,656 --> 00:07:16,014
It's quiet up here.

246
00:15:47,693 --> 00:15:49,182
So, what do ya say?

253
00:16:14,349 --> 00:16:16,095
Is anyone in there?

270
00:17:24,857 --> 00:17:26,605
Hey, wait a second!

411
00:25:09,682 --> 00:25:10,682
Global Action Club!

340
00:21:05,391 --> 00:21:06,728
It sure is peaceful.

356
00:22:33,155 --> 00:22:35,030
What? A punk rocker!

364
00:22:51,727 --> 00:22:53,205
Okay, I'll take one.

372
00:23:09,835 --> 00:23:10,932
Um, yes? What is it?

22
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:02,978
How did you find out?

32
00:04:29,099 --> 00:04:30,293
and the nib is split.

64
00:05:56,624 --> 00:05:58,250
Sounds kind of shady.

209
00:12:47,114 --> 00:12:48,350
Well, we'd better go.

248
00:15:53,301 --> 00:15:53,930
In the mountain de...

309
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:35,506
Oh, hi. Good morning!

321
00:20:01,269 --> 00:20:03,104
Yes. Forget about it.

29
00:04:20,141 --> 00:04:21,617
Ward it off with that.

77
00:06:41,281 --> 00:06:42,870
I think it's too busy.

164
00:10:57,349 --> 00:10:58,583
And that refers to...?

170
00:11:12,974 --> 00:11:14,394
You abused your power?

230
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:44,894
...is officially open!

243
00:15:34,981 --> 00:15:36,038
Springtime has passed.

257
00:16:42,787 --> 00:16:44,220
Oh, I beg your pardon.

326
00:20:15,485 --> 00:20:17,777
Oh, hey. This is Frol.

354
00:22:28,619 --> 00:22:30,079
Uh-oh, getting sleepy.

395
00:23:58,233 --> 00:23:59,409
Won't be needing that.

405
00:24:55,434 --> 00:24:56,654
We're the Occult Club!

417
00:27:07,322 --> 00:27:08,857
"A Corpse By Evening."

33
00:04:31,573 --> 00:04:33,132
What am I, a trash can?

80
00:06:45,462 --> 00:06:47,089
Yeah, I'm all finished.

89
00:07:22,461 --> 00:07:23,847
Try not to dwell on it.

114
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:39,349
Nice of you to show up.

131
00:09:21,168 --> 00:09:23,042
Right! I totally agree.

196
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:20,557
Wait... That's perfect!

236
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:02,533
Come try it! It's easy!

254
00:16:27,229 --> 00:16:28,942
What a gorgeous poster!

293
00:18:49,067 --> 00:18:50,520
Good morning, everyone!

353
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,624
I wonder what happened.

357
00:22:35,153 --> 00:22:36,695
Is he really punk rock?

412
00:25:10,707 --> 00:25:11,956
You want a magic charm?

49
00:05:15,745 --> 00:05:16,887
I'm gonna go bother her.

96
00:07:41,218 --> 00:07:42,801
It's almost time, right?

140
00:09:51,376 --> 00:09:52,927
The problem is two-fold:

179
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:36,146
Please help us out, sir!

195
00:12:17,424 --> 00:12:19,105
You're full of it today!

229
00:13:40,766 --> 00:13:42,663
our school's Kanyasai...

281
00:17:51,141 --> 00:17:52,562
So that's the situation.

298
00:18:57,682 --> 00:18:59,387
Yeah, I finally made it.

362
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,666
What, like, all of them?

5
00:01:04,736 --> 00:01:06,257
I've gotta see all of it.

11
00:01:42,502 --> 00:01:44,608
Starts tomorrow, I guess.

95
00:07:38,193 --> 00:07:39,923
Good morning to you, Chi.

165
00:10:58,694 --> 00:11:00,816
To this! Let me show you.

215
00:12:59,682 --> 00:13:01,579
This is our goal: <i>Hyouka</i>!

217
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:05,258
Everyone ready? On three!

232
00:14:34,016 --> 00:14:36,626
Wow! He flipped over him!

241
00:15:31,432 --> 00:15:32,807
The river from Tsukuhane.

279
00:17:45,682 --> 00:17:47,266
That's way too dangerous!

294
00:18:50,553 --> 00:18:52,156
Good morning to you, too.

325
00:20:13,957 --> 00:20:15,188
What's your costume from?

366
00:22:54,381 --> 00:22:55,874
He's actually a customer?

74
00:06:35,448 --> 00:06:37,448
Wow, check out this mural!

78
00:06:43,599 --> 00:06:44,763
Way too busy for my taste.

113
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,857
Oh, no! I broke my Saturn!

119
00:08:52,928 --> 00:08:55,599
Listen. I'm sorry. Really!

153
00:10:21,391 --> 00:10:22,927
Satoshi, care to weigh in?

176
00:11:26,907 --> 00:11:28,551
It sure seems like you do.

225
00:13:22,275 --> 00:13:23,629
This is amazing, isn't it?

251
00:15:59,432 --> 00:16:01,509
I'm wasting precious time!

10
00:01:21,384 --> 00:01:23,634
Tomorrow's finally the day!

18
00:03:55,782 --> 00:03:57,199
You're up kinda early, huh?

116
00:08:42,182 --> 00:08:43,418
You guys been waiting long?

156
00:10:30,141 --> 00:10:31,627
Worst case, he tells us no.

200
00:12:26,891 --> 00:12:28,625
And Satoshi will publicize.

275
00:17:35,933 --> 00:17:36,897
When we laid out this plan,

314
00:19:42,432 --> 00:19:44,099
No, I just bought the belt.

317
00:19:47,376 --> 00:19:49,249
Oh! Don't worry about that.

324
00:20:12,349 --> 00:20:13,932
Hey, there, how's it going?

338
00:20:44,203 --> 00:20:46,157
Well, we certainly are now!

349
00:22:05,612 --> 00:22:07,237
Anyone seen my apple juice?

382
00:23:30,515 --> 00:23:31,946
This pen is just the thing!

15
00:02:16,285 --> 00:02:18,161
It's cultural festival time!

34
00:04:33,164 --> 00:04:34,696
Better go or you'll be late.

98
00:07:43,659 --> 00:07:44,960
Let's give it our best shot!

146
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:06,977
I hadn't thought about that!

202
00:12:32,977 --> 00:12:34,583
But what's your role, Oreki?

235
00:14:56,809 --> 00:14:59,238
Hey, Calligraphy Club, guys!

237
00:15:03,898 --> 00:15:06,531
Hey there! Do you wanna try?

252
00:16:09,854 --> 00:16:11,629
Looks like I'm finally here.

259
00:16:50,307 --> 00:16:51,624
Well, you've just found him.

303
00:19:17,705 --> 00:19:20,054
Look who decided to cosplay.

331
00:20:25,764 --> 00:20:27,653
I consider it a masterpiece.

367
00:22:55,987 --> 00:22:57,645
I'll have to show gratitude.

414
00:25:25,695 --> 00:25:27,957
Is there an Equestrian Club?

92
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:31,341
Yeah, I'm well aware of that.

125
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,296
He forgot what he looks like!

155
00:10:28,618 --> 00:10:30,047
But it can't hurt to ask him.

192
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:15,498
Yeah, that's an awesome idea!

205
00:12:38,672 --> 00:12:40,208
I'm gonna hold down the fort.

221
00:13:17,448 --> 00:13:18,932
Hurry up and find your class.

245
00:15:38,225 --> 00:15:39,805
Though I must part from thee.

263
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:02,929
Global action! Global action!

269
00:17:22,371 --> 00:17:24,253
Okay, well, thank you anyway.

329
00:20:21,372 --> 00:20:22,887
I've never heard of that one.

124
00:09:06,516 --> 00:09:07,935
We're all friends here, right?

408
00:25:00,307 --> 00:25:02,682
Now displaying the Enterprise!

19
00:03:57,307 --> 00:03:58,974
Is today the cultural festival?

41
00:04:53,057 --> 00:04:54,724
You sure are enjoying yourself.

228
00:13:38,391 --> 00:13:40,734
for the 54th year in a row now,

274
00:17:33,883 --> 00:17:35,725
Thanks! I really appreciate it.

292
00:18:22,243 --> 00:18:23,991
Thanks for all your help today!

304
00:19:20,531 --> 00:19:22,641
And after she made such a fuss.

310
00:19:35,557 --> 00:19:36,770
Good morning, Madame President.

370
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:06,425
Thanks a lot for your business.

387
00:23:38,865 --> 00:23:40,613
Well then take this as a trade.

402
00:24:48,709 --> 00:24:50,734
I've grossly neglected my duty!

44
00:04:59,797 --> 00:05:01,898
Hey! Isn't that Mayaka up ahead?

52
00:05:25,612 --> 00:05:27,582
I like your outfit. Looks great.

67
00:06:04,849 --> 00:06:06,393
It's terrible luck, considering.

86
00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:03,955
I'll be back in a jiffy, though.

110
00:08:22,706 --> 00:08:24,524
And how many did we end up with?

137
00:09:46,371 --> 00:09:48,097
How much are we asking per copy?

185
00:11:51,516 --> 00:11:53,164
This is just one part of it all.

363
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:50,019
That's right. It's a long story.

50
00:05:18,838 --> 00:05:21,363
Hey, happy festival week, Mayaka.

59
00:05:43,617 --> 00:05:46,636
Frol who? Oh, Frolbericheri Frol?

122
00:09:02,635 --> 00:09:04,140
Did he forget what he looks like?

207
00:12:44,272 --> 00:12:45,824
I guess someone has to stay here.

233
00:14:37,566 --> 00:14:40,534
What? How does he spin like that?

352
00:22:10,535 --> 00:22:12,266
What's that piece of paper there?

400
00:24:29,164 --> 00:24:31,094
How would you like to be a model?

21
00:03:59,751 --> 00:04:01,557
I heard you guys had some trouble.

45
00:05:03,823 --> 00:05:05,869
That must be a Manga Club costume.

197
00:12:20,641 --> 00:12:22,366
You know, that's a fantastic plan.

198
00:12:22,391 --> 00:12:24,144
I think we should proceed with it.

369
00:23:01,979 --> 00:23:04,224
Aw, I can't bring myself to smile.

65
00:05:58,379 --> 00:06:00,299
Are you on Manga Club duty all day?

71
00:06:17,558 --> 00:06:19,766
Now this is what I call a festival!

118
00:08:45,141 --> 00:08:46,659
We haven't even gotten started yet.

139
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,267
That's pretty cheap, if you ask me.

183
00:11:47,474 --> 00:11:49,454
I want to take charge of publicity!

186
00:11:53,281 --> 00:11:54,986
I have something else up my sleeve.

286
00:18:02,785 --> 00:18:04,748
So there isn't anything you can do?

7
00:01:09,974 --> 00:01:12,182
The Quiz Club starts at one o'clock.

26
00:04:10,974 --> 00:04:13,132
Nobody wants your crappy traditions.

40
00:04:50,727 --> 00:04:52,944
Ah, the Hotaro we all know and love.

47
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:12,027
Did you come up with a costume, too?

54
00:05:31,012 --> 00:05:32,937
So what character are you cosplay...

69
00:06:09,773 --> 00:06:11,733
You can't change the past, you know?

222
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:20,404
Oh, how about the Quiz Club's event?

260
00:16:51,829 --> 00:16:54,444
I did? Oh, I guess that makes sense.

290
00:18:13,745 --> 00:18:15,530
I wouldn't have a problem with that.

318
00:19:49,412 --> 00:19:51,974
But... I did want to ask. You see...

322
00:20:07,094 --> 00:20:09,374
I couldn't even bring myself to ask.

330
00:20:23,626 --> 00:20:25,733
It was an old science fiction manga.

346
00:21:24,999 --> 00:21:26,818
that's twelve gone, without a doubt.

38
00:04:45,475 --> 00:04:47,938
It's the day of the festival, Hotaro!

313
00:19:40,443 --> 00:19:42,276
Did you spend a lot of money on that?

332
00:20:27,932 --> 00:20:29,609
You think I could borrow it sometime?

384
00:23:33,876 --> 00:23:36,227
Whoa, really? You'd give me this pen?

393
00:23:54,797 --> 00:23:56,685
I guess he already has his own style.

75
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:39,621
Whoever made this did a fantastic job.

82
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:54,374
All right, people! It's time to party!

94
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:38,099
I'm so glad you guys are finally here!

115
00:08:39,432 --> 00:08:41,559
Good morning, Fukube. Nice to see you.

123
00:09:04,165 --> 00:09:06,324
There's no need for self-flagellation.

172
00:11:17,891 --> 00:11:19,535
you should try the council room first.

173
00:11:20,063 --> 00:11:22,012
Wait, shouldn't you be the one to ask?

181
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,959
She doesn't seem too eager to do this.

184
00:11:49,599 --> 00:11:51,187
Is that why you're wearing that getup?

57
00:05:39,586 --> 00:05:41,933
Then what character are you dressed as?

83
00:06:58,307 --> 00:07:00,142
Well, I gotta leave you guys for a bit.

145
00:10:03,472 --> 00:10:05,641
Creating another storefront altogether?

158
00:10:34,766 --> 00:10:36,790
Who's the executive committee chairman?

191
00:12:11,266 --> 00:12:13,527
He just wants an excuse to play around.

358
00:22:37,148 --> 00:22:39,842
So, uh... What are you selling in here?

396
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,555
Glad I at least sold one issue, though.

401
00:24:46,057 --> 00:24:48,478
Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no, oh, no, oh, no!

406
00:24:56,884 --> 00:24:58,704
Would you like to summon a UFO with us?

66
00:06:02,452 --> 00:06:04,824
I got stuck with the salesgirl position.

130
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:20,855
We're all responsible for what happened.

174
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:24,724
Well, I guess I could do that if I must,

299
00:19:04,349 --> 00:19:06,831
You even have a katana for your costume?

121
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,588
Everybody makes mistakes once in a while.

234
00:14:45,654 --> 00:14:47,885
I don't have time to stay and watch this!

239
00:15:13,803 --> 00:15:15,969
You can keep it if you want to, you know.

256
00:16:40,444 --> 00:16:42,735
Hi, there. Can I help you with something?

278
00:17:43,745 --> 00:17:45,599
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold up, hold up!

282
00:17:52,891 --> 00:17:55,533
Sounds like quite the predicament. Hmm...

285
00:18:00,213 --> 00:18:02,175
I can't be partial to you guys, you know?

43
00:04:57,641 --> 00:04:59,706
The hall of fame for all the school clubs!

108
00:08:18,412 --> 00:08:20,479
How many were we originally trying to get?

201
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,422
All right, it's official. Let's get to it.

271
00:17:27,224 --> 00:17:29,307
I meant I can't just do that on principle.

323
00:20:09,428 --> 00:20:11,558
I'm sure they'd let me leave some in here.

335
00:20:34,003 --> 00:20:36,243
All right, everyone! Time to get fired up!

351
00:22:08,182 --> 00:22:10,369
Man, I didn't even get to drink any of it!

157
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,891
We could ask the student council president.

178
00:11:31,287 --> 00:11:33,184
I'll jump in to back you up if you need me.

187
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,179
Do you have a crazy brilliant plan in mind?

214
00:12:57,274 --> 00:12:59,561
Let's try to sell as many copies as we can!

316
00:19:45,103 --> 00:19:47,255
I'll reimburse you if you have the receipt.

319
00:19:54,612 --> 00:19:59,999
Oh... Nothing. Uh... I just figured it out.

407
00:24:58,766 --> 00:25:00,282
Or come see our spirit photography exhibit?

2
00:00:08,658 --> 00:00:10,789
Are the others getting a good night's sleep?

60
00:05:48,418 --> 00:05:50,981
I've got some gloves that I'll put on later.

62
00:05:52,876 --> 00:05:55,446
What have you got in your bag? It's stuffed.

91
00:07:27,813 --> 00:07:29,599
Chitanda will start worrying about you, too.

134
00:09:34,724 --> 00:09:36,737
He had to have forgotten what he looks like!

175
00:11:24,826 --> 00:11:26,812
but I don't have much luck with negotiating.

188
00:12:00,075 --> 00:12:02,304
I'm going to drop the Classic Lit Club name.

333
00:20:30,872 --> 00:20:32,801
What's up, guys? What are you talking about?

30
00:04:24,766 --> 00:04:27,032
Do you expect me to say "thank you" for this?

31
00:04:27,057 --> 00:04:29,016
Oh, I guess I should mention it's out of ink,

150
00:10:13,881 --> 00:10:15,787
But isn't that a little bit dramatic, though?

159
00:10:37,241 --> 00:10:39,526
You could at least consult the guide, Hotaro.

180
00:11:40,615 --> 00:11:42,916
Okay. I guess I might as well give it a shot.

327
00:20:17,932 --> 00:20:20,130
Haven't you ever heard of "They Were Eleven?"

337
00:20:39,786 --> 00:20:42,313
Excuse me. Are you all open for business yet?

361
00:22:42,814 --> 00:22:45,371
I mean, we're selling our club's anthologies.

284
00:17:58,072 --> 00:18:00,102
I feel the same way about all the other clubs.

301
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,555
It's just a fake plastic one. Nothing special.

307
00:19:26,753 --> 00:19:29,117
That kind of talk is uncalled for. Cut it out.

409
00:25:02,749 --> 00:25:05,020
You don't want to miss our Launching Ceremony!

36
00:04:39,257 --> 00:04:41,932
If I have time, I'll stop by and say hi to you!

272
00:17:29,545 --> 00:17:31,834
If you have special circumstances, I'll listen.

107
00:08:13,584 --> 00:08:16,722
Well, I am responsible for messing up the order.

168
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:11,153
The executive committee puts the guide together.

283
00:17:55,686 --> 00:17:57,957
As much as I would like to help you out somehow,

373
00:23:10,957 --> 00:23:12,741
That pen! Would you mind if I took a look at it?

385
00:23:36,293 --> 00:23:38,335
I was just gonna throw it in the trash, so yeah.

415
00:25:28,007 --> 00:25:30,617
I could really use a pair of blinders about now!

8
00:01:12,328 --> 00:01:15,777
A Shogi tournament? Not sure I'm up for that one.

24
00:04:04,956 --> 00:04:07,492
Besides, it's tradition that the Classic Lit Club

177
00:11:28,682 --> 00:11:30,967
Chitanda, I think you should do the talking here.

277
00:17:41,433 --> 00:17:43,720
So when I lay on the gas, that means we take off!

148
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:13,110
You have managed to blow my mind yet again, Oreki!

167
00:11:05,099 --> 00:11:07,554
I called in a favor, and they came through for us.

171
00:11:15,516 --> 00:11:17,807
Yeah, what of it? If you want to ask the chairman,

199
00:12:24,423 --> 00:12:26,807
Chitanda will try to negotiate a better storefront.

339
00:20:46,182 --> 00:20:49,432
Game faces on, guys, we've got our first customers!

391
00:23:51,187 --> 00:23:53,687
Satoshi's probably the only one who would use this.

42
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:57,617
Of course I am! Why not? It's the cultural festival!

389
00:23:46,603 --> 00:23:49,400
We'll set you up with a top-notch, stylish ensemble.

105
00:08:06,983 --> 00:08:09,842
You know, why don't I just go ahead and buy them all?

133
00:09:32,486 --> 00:09:34,699
Good. I'm glad you finally got your head on straight.

163
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:52,474
I wish you would have noticed the fruits of my labor!

210
00:12:48,477 --> 00:12:50,838
Roll call for the opening ceremony is about to start.

240
00:15:17,974 --> 00:15:20,435
I shouldn't have stopped! I don't have time for this!

291
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:21,163
That is a really good idea! I'll start asking around!

46
00:05:06,505 --> 00:05:09,271
Judging by her outfit, I'd say she's on festival time.

262
00:16:55,637 --> 00:16:57,932
I'd like a better storefront for the Classic Lit Club.

413
00:25:12,724 --> 00:25:15,859
The Acapella Club is doing a concert in the courtyard!

48
00:05:12,662 --> 00:05:15,586
Well, I am a member of the handicrafts club, after all.

106
00:08:10,182 --> 00:08:13,314
No! I wasn't trying to make you feel guilty, I promise!

265
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:11,349
And I came here today to make a special request of you!

266
00:17:11,374 --> 00:17:14,258
Please give the Classic Lit Club a better selling space!

9
00:01:16,389 --> 00:01:19,773
Ooh! The cooking contest is definitely worth checking out!

100
00:07:47,462 --> 00:07:50,172
Is our best shot really going to have much impact, though?

347
00:21:27,204 --> 00:21:29,656
Well, even if that's all we
sell, I'd say we did all right.

14
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:07,308
May we have the perseverance
to climb the mountain before us.

129
00:09:15,835 --> 00:09:18,750
After I turned in my draft, I
washed my hands of it for sure.

213
00:12:54,286 --> 00:12:57,234
We will all proceed with the
plan that we have just outlined.

380
00:23:24,198 --> 00:23:27,170
I'm in the Fashion Club, and
we're doing a runway show today.

144
00:10:00,653 --> 00:10:03,433
and to create a more eyecatching
storefront in a busier place.

4
00:01:01,003 --> 00:01:04,107
The whole school is really going
full out for this, aren't they?

143
00:09:57,801 --> 00:10:00,628
So it'd help us to generate some
buzz about the Classic Lit Club

403
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:54,301
I keep getting distracted by
every interesting club event I see!

68
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:09,741
Well, don't waste any of that
precious energy beating yourself up.

73
00:06:30,246 --> 00:06:33,519
I knew they went all out, but
this is better than I ever imagined!

381
00:23:27,307 --> 00:23:30,458
I forgot to bring something to
put in my formalwear breast pocket.

25
00:04:07,517 --> 00:04:10,805
can't get through a cultural
festival without some kind of problem.

302
00:19:14,462 --> 00:19:17,249
You couldn't find anything to
wear on your feet that worked better?

345
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:24,974
I'll add our advisor to that, and
counting the one for the archives,

410
00:25:06,122 --> 00:25:09,599
Who wouldn't want to see three
months of hard work go down the tube?

55
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:37,635
Do not use that awful word in the
presence of such respectable people.

135
00:09:37,599 --> 00:09:40,590
There's not much time to discuss
business before the opening ceremony.

101
00:07:54,103 --> 00:07:57,203
That's a good point! There's no
guarantee that our best shot will help.

189
00:12:02,558 --> 00:12:06,370
I'll make the festival rounds,
participating in the events and contests.

166
00:11:01,099 --> 00:11:04,875
Look, the Classic Lit Club is listed
at the end of all the club profiles.

343
00:21:14,192 --> 00:21:17,509
I think I can go ahead and mark down
the ones we're definitely gonna sell.

127
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:13,777
I'm the club president, so I should
have looked it over before we confirmed.

27
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:16,532
If that's the case, you had better throw
me a good luck charm to ward that off.

258
00:16:44,692 --> 00:16:49,027
Yes, actually, I'm looking for Tanabe,
the Chairman of the Executive Committee.

120
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:59,617
It's all my fault. I should have read
the email from the printers more carefully.

147
00:10:07,136 --> 00:10:10,565
I was just trying to come up with something
to lure customers all the way up here!

141
00:09:53,133 --> 00:09:57,098
Our club's lack of name recognition and
the fact that we're stuck so out of the way.

264
00:17:04,038 --> 00:17:08,574
Sorry! Hold on! I guess I should tell you
that I'm the Classic Lit Club's president!

305
00:19:22,724 --> 00:19:25,933
She should've just listened to Kochi from
the beginning. She'd have been better off.

154
00:10:23,802 --> 00:10:28,593
Hmm... That's a special request, so it
depends on what the committee chairman thinks.

276
00:17:36,922 --> 00:17:40,622
I was under the impression that Fukube was
going to be here to help me out with this.

90
00:07:24,266 --> 00:07:27,750
If you keep fretting about what happened,
Satoshi won't be the only one badgering you.

13
00:01:59,753 --> 00:02:04,141
Please let us have nothing but good fortune
at the cultural festival the next three days.

151
00:10:15,954 --> 00:10:19,600
You don't think it'll be hard to get permission
to move on the first day of the festival?

344
00:21:17,534 --> 00:21:21,846
Given the circumstances, it's safe to say
the Classic Lit Club members will each buy two.

190
00:12:06,599 --> 00:12:11,241
The plan is to perform really well and to beef
up the Classic Lit Club's reputation that way.

289
00:18:09,835 --> 00:18:13,657
If you want to talk to the other club chairs
and ask them to keep some of your books to sell,

103
00:07:58,227 --> 00:08:02,374
if we don't give it our best shot, then it
certainly won't help, so we might as well try our best!

388
00:23:41,775 --> 00:23:46,562
It's a VIP pass to our show, so if you come by
the club room, be sure to bring that thing with you.

267
00:17:15,751 --> 00:17:20,320
I can't just hand you a better selling space when
you show up out of the blue on the day of the festival.

136
00:09:40,724 --> 00:09:46,095
We've got our work cut out for us, so do any of you have
ideas about how we can sell as many copies as possible?
