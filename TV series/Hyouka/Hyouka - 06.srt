1
00:00:01,476 --> 00:00:03,779
So that's when it all changed for Rome.

2
00:00:04,057 --> 00:00:09,187
When the Romans overthrew the Etruscans
in 509 B.C., Rome established a republic.

3
00:00:09,283 --> 00:00:11,636
The people were divided into two classes:

4
00:00:11,684 --> 00:00:13,772
The patricians, made up of aristocrats,

5
00:00:13,797 --> 00:00:15,926
and the plebeians, made up of common folk...

6
00:00:15,951 --> 00:00:17,340
I'm so bored.

7
00:00:17,365 --> 00:00:19,748
The classes were strictly forbidden from intermixing.

8
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:22,236
Now, the aristocrats held all important

9
00:00:22,339 --> 00:00:26,191
governmental offices, such as the
two consuls, and the 300 senators.

10
00:00:26,508 --> 00:00:30,792
Furthermore, the senate was considered to
be the highest legislative and advisory body,

11
00:00:30,942 --> 00:00:33,781
meeting in the curia to convene and pass laws.

12
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:34,844
Did you hear that?

13
00:00:34,892 --> 00:00:35,673
Yeah, what was it?

14
00:00:35,698 --> 00:00:38,181
Is that Class A? With Mr. Omichi?

15
00:00:38,315 --> 00:00:39,825
Yeah, I think so.

16
00:00:40,635 --> 00:00:43,115
It's as if you have no desire to learn anything,

17
00:00:43,344 --> 00:00:44,847
so why are you even here?!

18
00:00:45,373 --> 00:00:47,859
It is Class A. What the heck's going on?

19
00:00:47,931 --> 00:00:51,353
Sounds like Omichi snapped and
is on one of his tirades again.

20
00:00:52,919 --> 00:00:54,492
Hurry up, we don't have all day!

21
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:55,158
What's your answer?!

22
00:00:55,182 --> 00:00:56,072
Mr. Omichi...

23
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:59,513
Maybe you should look at the lesson
plan again. I think you've got it wrong.

24
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:01,048
Excuse me?!

25
00:01:01,087 --> 00:01:04,638
Before you scream at us, you ought to be
sure you're not the one making a mistake.

26
00:01:04,708 --> 00:01:06,075
Is that Chitanda?

27
00:01:09,065 --> 00:01:11,708
Ah, sorry. I see where we are.

28
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:13,567
Tamura, you may sit down.

29
00:01:15,832 --> 00:01:16,778
Okay!

30
00:01:16,865 --> 00:01:18,954
Let's get back to the Roman Republic.

31
00:01:20,361 --> 00:01:21,807
Let's see, where were we?

32
00:01:21,945 --> 00:01:24,141
Oh, yes, the senate and the curia.

33
00:01:24,387 --> 00:01:28,892
So the curia was a huge building
on the grounds of the Roman forum.

34
00:03:01,392 --> 00:03:05,033
It was your idea for us to get
together in the first place, Fukube!

35
00:03:06,881 --> 00:03:07,911
Hey, Mayaka.

36
00:03:07,981 --> 00:03:09,436
Why don't you just try to calm down?

37
00:03:09,499 --> 00:03:11,328
You should just stay out of this, Chi.

38
00:03:11,383 --> 00:03:12,868
Look, maybe you did have a reason,

39
00:03:12,893 --> 00:03:14,504
but it's common courtesy to call!

40
00:03:14,529 --> 00:03:17,382
Or you could have even sent me a text at the very least!

41
00:03:17,407 --> 00:03:18,821
I wouldn't have cared if you'd cancelled,

42
00:03:18,846 --> 00:03:20,575
but to stand me up without a word?

43
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,362
I know you've got a cell phone,

44
00:03:22,387 --> 00:03:23,849
so why didn't you use it?

45
00:03:23,874 --> 00:03:25,032
It never occurs to you to do the right thing!

46
00:03:25,057 --> 00:03:27,885
You don't care about anyone but
yourself, and that's the truth!

47
00:03:28,115 --> 00:03:29,116
This is a big deal.

48
00:03:29,156 --> 00:03:30,410
That's a bold move on your part, Chitanda.

49
00:03:30,435 --> 00:03:32,428
Apologizing won't let you off the hook this time!

50
00:03:32,453 --> 00:03:34,431
You're full of useless information...

51
00:03:34,612 --> 00:03:36,756
Your efforts are futile, though.

52
00:03:37,029 --> 00:03:38,815
You had to know how mad I would be,

53
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,175
but you didn't care!

54
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:42,527
Then it started storming like crazy!

55
00:03:42,574 --> 00:03:45,665
Rain, thunder, lighting, hail! Hail, Fukube!

56
00:03:45,729 --> 00:03:48,326
You're the most inconsiderate person I've ever met!

57
00:03:48,374 --> 00:03:50,543
I even got all dressed up, like an idiot,

58
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:53,738
and by the time I got home, my favorite outfit was ruined!

59
00:03:53,762 --> 00:03:54,553
Ruined, Fukube!

60
00:03:54,577 --> 00:03:56,167
Aren't you tired yet?

61
00:03:56,573 --> 00:03:57,615
Yes, I am.

62
00:03:57,693 --> 00:03:59,107
Why don't you take a breather?

63
00:03:59,202 --> 00:04:00,575
Fine, good idea.

64
00:04:05,699 --> 00:04:08,043
I didn't intervene for your sake, dummy.

65
00:04:08,257 --> 00:04:08,940
Wow.

66
00:04:09,011 --> 00:04:11,212
I've gotta say, you get mad really often.

67
00:04:11,403 --> 00:04:12,944
Does yelling make you feel any better?

68
00:04:12,992 --> 00:04:17,607
You know, I only seem to get ticked enough to yell
when you are involved, which I think is pretty telling.

69
00:04:17,726 --> 00:04:18,839
Yeah, makes sense.

70
00:04:18,902 --> 00:04:21,739
You know, maybe you should take
a few pages from Chitanda's book.

71
00:04:21,795 --> 00:04:23,614
She never gets riled up about anything.

72
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:24,234
Huh?

73
00:04:24,845 --> 00:04:27,054
I've never seen you like that, either, Satoshi.

74
00:04:27,179 --> 00:04:29,302
And come to think of it, though I've seen him get annoyed,

75
00:04:29,327 --> 00:04:31,280
Oreki doesn't often get downright angry.

76
00:04:31,447 --> 00:04:32,853
Not as far as I have noticed, anyway.

77
00:04:32,925 --> 00:04:34,609
Fuku totally gets angry.

78
00:04:34,728 --> 00:04:36,300
Yeah, I've seen him livid.

79
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,065
Do you really?

80
00:04:40,504 --> 00:04:41,615
Of course.

81
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:44,452
I may not flip out and start screaming like Mayaka.

82
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:45,827
But yeah, I get mad.

83
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:49,615
I couldn't even imagine you having
that kind of reaction about anything.

84
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,674
Well, I am human, after all.

85
00:04:51,769 --> 00:04:53,184
I get angry sometimes.

86
00:04:53,351 --> 00:04:57,275
True, but you don't make a big production
about venting your feelings in front of everyone.

87
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:00,366
He's not very scary when he gets angry, though.

88
00:05:00,524 --> 00:05:01,709
Are you serious?

89
00:05:02,441 --> 00:05:04,483
Well, it's sure news to me.

90
00:05:04,624 --> 00:05:07,636
That piques my curiosity. I want to see it.

91
00:05:07,778 --> 00:05:08,232
What?

92
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:12,674
I predict that Chitanda will hatch some grand
scheme to trick Satoshi into getting ticked off.

93
00:05:12,825 --> 00:05:15,607
Just to see if it's possible. I can't wait for that.

94
00:05:15,789 --> 00:05:18,100
Oreki, do you have a secret temper?

95
00:05:19,348 --> 00:05:21,485
There's no hot blood in that one at all.

96
00:05:21,548 --> 00:05:23,034
Because he's so level headed?

97
00:05:23,995 --> 00:05:28,358
It's more that he is way too selfish and
shallow to get upset about anything in life.

98
00:05:28,414 --> 00:05:31,234
Hey, we may be frenemies, but that's over the line.

99
00:05:31,986 --> 00:05:33,268
Whoa, I got mad!

100
00:05:33,426 --> 00:05:36,096
Don't get me started on Hotaro; we'll be here all night.

101
00:05:36,156 --> 00:05:39,002
But Chitanda's lack of irascibility is almost heroic.

102
00:05:39,027 --> 00:05:40,202
She's like a Zen master.

103
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:41,783
Her patience is incredible.

104
00:05:41,871 --> 00:05:44,088
No matter what, she always rolls with the punches.

105
00:05:44,167 --> 00:05:46,082
You might be happier if you tried to be more like her.

106
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:47,425
That's easy for you to say,

107
00:05:47,464 --> 00:05:49,888
but you don't understand what it's like to be me.

108
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:51,977
I don't think I could ever be a calm as Chi.

109
00:05:52,231 --> 00:05:54,083
Hold on. I'm confused.

110
00:05:54,115 --> 00:05:55,257
Is all this a compliment?

111
00:05:55,282 --> 00:05:57,054
For sure. It's totally a good thing.

112
00:05:57,292 --> 00:06:00,089
It's just an observation. There's no judgement either way.

113
00:06:00,264 --> 00:06:01,035
Definitely.

114
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:05,452
Not being able to get angry is not good, but
the ability to rise above it is another story.

115
00:06:05,642 --> 00:06:08,160
After all, wrath is a pretty serious sin.

116
00:06:08,359 --> 00:06:11,339
You should cut me some slack, Mayaka.
The way you lash out isn't right.

117
00:06:11,498 --> 00:06:12,281
A sin?

118
00:06:12,348 --> 00:06:14,245
You mean the seven deadly sins?

119
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:16,448
Yeah! I'm impressed, Chitanda.

120
00:06:16,772 --> 00:06:18,432
They're pretty well known throughout the world.

121
00:06:18,457 --> 00:06:20,212
Hey, Mayaka, have you ever heard of them?

122
00:06:20,292 --> 00:06:22,922
Yeah. Everybody knows about those, right?

123
00:06:22,992 --> 00:06:25,489
Wait a sec, I thought there were 108 sins.

124
00:06:25,711 --> 00:06:27,348
No, those are Earthly Desires.

125
00:06:27,523 --> 00:06:28,445
Excuse me.

126
00:06:28,509 --> 00:06:29,406
Let me see...

127
00:06:29,748 --> 00:06:33,061
There's wrath, pride, gluttony, greed.

128
00:06:34,038 --> 00:06:36,779
Envy, lust, and sloth are the three others.

129
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:37,693
Yeah, that's right!

130
00:06:38,058 --> 00:06:39,734
Sloth, you say?

131
00:06:39,845 --> 00:06:41,411
What's she looking at me for?

132
00:06:41,522 --> 00:06:43,777
Wow! That means Chi is perfect!

133
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:46,647
You're honest, kind, and you don't eat too much.

134
00:06:46,735 --> 00:06:47,948
I wouldn't go that far.

135
00:06:48,014 --> 00:06:51,025
I doubt that you've ever been
greedy, and you're really diligent.

136
00:06:51,088 --> 00:06:51,564
I am?

137
00:06:51,589 --> 00:06:52,773
And another thing...

138
00:06:52,805 --> 00:06:54,639
As for lust, you're not slutty.

139
00:06:54,697 --> 00:06:55,205
Awkward...

140
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:58,301
There's no way to know if she's
envious, but I would bet she isn't.

141
00:06:58,406 --> 00:07:01,877
This has turned from giving her
simple compliments into full-out teasing.

142
00:07:02,337 --> 00:07:03,751
Let's stop talking about it!

143
00:07:03,863 --> 00:07:05,444
Anyway, when I am hungry,

144
00:07:05,469 --> 00:07:07,439
I can eat more food than you would ever imagine!

145
00:07:07,614 --> 00:07:08,868
No surprise there.

146
00:07:08,893 --> 00:07:11,110
I think her new nickname should be Saint Chi!

147
00:07:11,135 --> 00:07:14,199
Eru Chitanda kind of sounds
like an angel's name, doesn't it?

148
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:17,508
The Archangels Michael, Gabriel, Uriel, and Eru!

149
00:07:19,857 --> 00:07:21,382
I don't think this is funny!

150
00:07:22,963 --> 00:07:24,076
She got mad.

151
00:07:24,178 --> 00:07:26,109
You're right. She yelled at us.

152
00:07:26,855 --> 00:07:28,794
Sorry, we didn't mean it, Chi.

153
00:07:28,921 --> 00:07:30,272
I'm done talking.

154
00:07:30,821 --> 00:07:31,845
Good job!

155
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:34,347
You know exactly what to say to make a girl angry!

156
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,097
Hold on just a minute! I think she's mad at you, too!

157
00:07:39,286 --> 00:07:42,906
Just 'cause wrath is a sin doesn't
mean it's good to never get angry.

158
00:07:43,161 --> 00:07:46,028
The same goes for the other deadly sins, too, doesn't it?

159
00:07:47,498 --> 00:07:50,876
Pride and greed can be useful as
long as they're kept in balance.

160
00:07:51,106 --> 00:07:52,266
What do you mean?

161
00:07:52,592 --> 00:07:55,237
Well, imagine a person who has no pride whatsoever.

162
00:07:55,371 --> 00:07:58,026
Doesn't that mean they also have zero confidence?

163
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,910
And if a person doesn't have an ounce of greed at all,

164
00:08:00,935 --> 00:08:04,224
wouldn't it be difficult for them to
take care of themselves or a family?

165
00:08:05,137 --> 00:08:06,560
And think about envy.

166
00:08:06,616 --> 00:08:08,276
If people didn't ever feel it,

167
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:12,177
there wouldn't be as many
innovations, new technologies or ideas.

168
00:08:13,686 --> 00:08:14,781
Oh! Um...

169
00:08:14,974 --> 00:08:17,906
I didn't mean to go into lecture mode or anything, sorry.

170
00:08:18,239 --> 00:08:20,980
Hmm... That's okay. Interesting take.

171
00:08:21,066 --> 00:08:22,958
So they're fine in moderation?

172
00:08:23,427 --> 00:08:26,525
I just don't think it's wise
to take the term "deadly sins"

173
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:31,406
so literally, and then live our lives as if those seven
normal human emotions are gonna kill us or something.

174
00:08:31,633 --> 00:08:35,423
So then what you're saying is that it's
not necessarily a bad thing to get mad?

175
00:08:35,526 --> 00:08:36,663
Yeah, pretty much.

176
00:08:36,726 --> 00:08:38,745
I mean, if you always stifle your anger,

177
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:41,828
it might start to get in the way of
your ability to enjoy your life, too.

178
00:08:41,947 --> 00:08:43,686
I definitely get mad.

179
00:08:44,902 --> 00:08:48,159
But, like, if that's your philosophy,
then why don't you ever get mad?

180
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,779
Because it's draining.

181
00:08:50,056 --> 00:08:52,337
And I avoid doing things that wear me out.

182
00:09:02,488 --> 00:09:03,166
No!

183
00:09:03,191 --> 00:09:05,447
Our Chitanda has been corrupted by Hotaro!

184
00:09:05,685 --> 00:09:07,043
How could we have let this happen?

185
00:09:07,068 --> 00:09:09,403
There are evil spirits roaming the halls of Kami high!

186
00:09:09,428 --> 00:09:11,588
Ghosts hell-bent on conserving energy!

187
00:09:11,613 --> 00:09:13,376
Please, Chi, snap out of it!

188
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,847
That's right, laugh it up, you jerks.

189
00:09:15,895 --> 00:09:16,906
I'm kidding.

190
00:09:17,231 --> 00:09:17,854
Huh?

191
00:09:17,961 --> 00:09:18,398
Huh?

192
00:09:18,822 --> 00:09:20,185
I was just playing!

193
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:23,887
It was a joke?

194
00:09:24,268 --> 00:09:26,644
And here I thought I'd found my twin flame.

195
00:09:27,136 --> 00:09:28,408
Sorry to scare you.

196
00:09:28,433 --> 00:09:29,598
I just thought it'd be funny.

197
00:09:32,221 --> 00:09:33,948
But it isn't like I don't get angry.

198
00:09:34,263 --> 00:09:35,853
Everyone does, even me!

199
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:40,127
Yeah, for example, I get mad when...

200
00:09:43,051 --> 00:09:45,952
I get really angry when I see people wasting food.

201
00:09:46,007 --> 00:09:48,779
In my house, a grain of rice equals a drop of sweat.

202
00:09:50,201 --> 00:09:52,600
She's totally a true farmer's daughter.

203
00:09:53,251 --> 00:09:54,546
Hey, I almost forgot.

204
00:09:54,673 --> 00:09:56,374
Speaking of flying off the handle,

205
00:09:56,461 --> 00:09:59,719
wasn't that you I heard yelling at
Mr. Omichi during fifth period today?

206
00:10:03,826 --> 00:10:04,955
Yeah, you're right.

207
00:10:05,725 --> 00:10:07,990
I can't believe I forgot about that!

208
00:10:08,697 --> 00:10:10,183
I want to hear your thoughts!

209
00:10:10,246 --> 00:10:12,867
Tell me what you make of my angry outburst today, Oreki!

210
00:10:12,892 --> 00:10:14,011
Aw, crap.

211
00:10:26,023 --> 00:10:27,922
Well... I gotta get going.

212
00:10:30,011 --> 00:10:30,562
Wait!

213
00:10:30,645 --> 00:10:33,641
Before you go, I just want to hear
what you think about what happened!

214
00:10:37,432 --> 00:10:38,989
Did something crazy go down?

215
00:10:39,073 --> 00:10:42,056
Yeah, as a matter of fact, it was crazy!

216
00:10:42,134 --> 00:10:43,614
I still can't believe it.

217
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:45,990
In math... I got angry.

218
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:48,784
Whoa. Chi, are you kidding again?

219
00:10:48,975 --> 00:10:50,198
No, I'm serious.

220
00:10:50,223 --> 00:10:53,272
But I can't really figure out
what specifically made me mad,

221
00:10:53,297 --> 00:10:54,727
only that I had gotten mad.

222
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:57,548
Ordinarily, I would have made
the choice not to have gotten mad,

223
00:10:57,627 --> 00:11:01,084
but I made the mad choice, and now
being made mad makes me really curious.

224
00:11:01,163 --> 00:11:04,448
Which kind of makes the being
made mad okay, if you think about it.

225
00:11:06,823 --> 00:11:08,178
Have you gone mad?

226
00:11:08,233 --> 00:11:11,380
I was made mad and then made curious about being made mad!

227
00:11:14,247 --> 00:11:15,613
Never mind the semantics!

228
00:11:15,638 --> 00:11:16,781
I have to know!

229
00:11:21,454 --> 00:11:23,894
Go! Fight! Go! Fight! Go! Fight!

230
00:11:24,053 --> 00:11:26,427
Today my class had math fifth period.

231
00:11:26,777 --> 00:11:29,263
Mr. Omichi was teaching, and in a bad mood.

232
00:11:29,352 --> 00:11:31,489
Oreki and Fukube, you guys have him, too,

233
00:11:31,521 --> 00:11:34,834
so you know pretty well what he can
be like when he gets himself riled up.

234
00:11:34,993 --> 00:11:37,751
I guess I should explain what
happened from the very beginning.

235
00:11:37,949 --> 00:11:38,999
Let's see.

236
00:11:39,673 --> 00:11:43,748
Mr. Omichi opened the door to the classroom
right as the tardy bell started to ring.

237
00:11:44,057 --> 00:11:47,839
Before he came in, he stopped outside the
doorway and looked up at the class plate.

238
00:11:48,038 --> 00:11:50,557
I guess so he would know what class he was teaching.

239
00:11:50,764 --> 00:11:53,219
But that's not unusual. He does it every time.

240
00:11:54,498 --> 00:11:58,669
Once he got in, the first thing he did was
write a quadratic equation up on the board.

241
00:11:58,939 --> 00:12:01,790
It was simple enough, but he did something new this time.

242
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:05,674
He included bounds for X, which
wasn't something we knew how to do.

243
00:12:06,962 --> 00:12:09,005
Then Omichi called on Kawasaki.

244
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:13,461
He told him to stand up in front of the
class and solve the equation for the range of Y.

245
00:12:14,097 --> 00:12:15,573
Kawasaki froze.

246
00:12:15,908 --> 00:12:19,999
He was confused, which is only natural,
considering we hadn't learned about ranges yet.

247
00:12:20,253 --> 00:12:21,787
We were all nervous at this point.

248
00:12:22,657 --> 00:12:26,531
Kawasaki said that he didn't know how
to solve for Y, which is what started it.

249
00:12:26,856 --> 00:12:31,471
That's when Mr. Omichi flipped out and
started screaming at us for being bad students.

250
00:12:31,829 --> 00:12:35,524
He calmed down after a bit and called
on Tamura, who is really good at math.

251
00:12:35,746 --> 00:12:38,430
Unfortunately, Tamura didn't know what to do, either.

252
00:12:38,835 --> 00:12:41,301
When the best guy at math in the class didn't know,

253
00:12:41,412 --> 00:12:45,201
I got the idea that maybe Mr. Omichi
had been mistaken about the lesson plan.

254
00:12:45,613 --> 00:12:49,356
The other students must have figured it
out, too, and things got a little chaotic.

255
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:54,401
Well, that really set Mr. Omichi off,
so he started being even harsher with us.

256
00:12:54,865 --> 00:12:59,128
He even started beating the chalkboard
like a maniac, which had never happened before.

257
00:13:00,026 --> 00:13:04,840
Someone in class may have been able to solve the
problem, but at that point, no one wanted to speak up.

258
00:13:05,054 --> 00:13:06,906
Everyone just stared at their desks.

259
00:13:07,073 --> 00:13:10,512
Then Mr. Omichi made Tamura stand
up again, and started berating him,

260
00:13:10,537 --> 00:13:12,730
trying to make an example out of him, I guess.

261
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:15,607
That's when I just couldn't take
it anymore and had to stand up.

262
00:13:15,758 --> 00:13:20,730
I told Omichi he must be mistaken and to
double-check our class's progress in the lesson plan.

263
00:13:21,775 --> 00:13:24,924
So now I see that's the exact point when I got angry.

264
00:13:26,108 --> 00:13:27,793
Well, what happened next?

265
00:13:27,864 --> 00:13:28,865
Let me see.

266
00:13:29,086 --> 00:13:31,097
Then he just turned the page in his textbook.

267
00:13:31,232 --> 00:13:33,346
He saw something there and said, "Oh, that's right."

268
00:13:33,417 --> 00:13:34,531
Then he apologized.

269
00:13:34,824 --> 00:13:38,990
After that, he told Tamura to sit down and
continued teaching like nothing had even happened.

270
00:13:39,247 --> 00:13:41,838
So that's Mr. Omichi's teaching style, huh?

271
00:13:41,925 --> 00:13:42,863
Oh, for sure.

272
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:47,979
You would be traumatized if I went into detail
about the kind of grief that man gave me after midterms.

273
00:13:48,058 --> 00:13:51,285
We had teachers like him back in
elementary and middle school, though, right?

274
00:13:51,918 --> 00:13:53,716
Ones with really bad tempers?

275
00:13:54,177 --> 00:13:57,007
Besides, your crappy grades are your own fault, not his.

276
00:13:57,213 --> 00:13:58,715
You better study for the final.

277
00:14:00,408 --> 00:14:02,091
So anyway, that's the story.

278
00:14:02,116 --> 00:14:03,132
What do you think?

279
00:14:05,849 --> 00:14:08,279
Is anything about that out of the ordinary?

280
00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:13,833
Ah!

281
00:14:13,912 --> 00:14:18,083
What I'm curious about is how Mr. Omichi
made that kind of mistake in the first place.

282
00:14:18,131 --> 00:14:20,125
It seems so out of character for him.

283
00:14:20,164 --> 00:14:23,065
He's usually kind of a perfectionist, so it's odd.

284
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:24,662
Yeah, you're right.

285
00:14:24,687 --> 00:14:29,373
And I think the reason Omichi is so strict with
the students is that he's equally hard on himself.

286
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:32,266
So then how could he have made such a simple mistake?

287
00:14:32,321 --> 00:14:33,775
That's the part I don't understand.

288
00:14:33,926 --> 00:14:36,142
Yeah, weird. I don't understand it either.

289
00:14:36,221 --> 00:14:37,215
Hey, Oreki!

290
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:38,058
Beats me.

291
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:39,750
Look, if you really wanna know that badly,

292
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:42,887
why don't you go right to the source
and pick Omichi's brain instead of mine?

293
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:45,049
Because that would take all the fun out of it.

294
00:14:45,136 --> 00:14:45,884
Oh, yeah?

295
00:14:45,971 --> 00:14:47,655
Well, I guess you'll never know the answer.

296
00:14:47,703 --> 00:14:48,863
You might as well give it up.

297
00:14:48,926 --> 00:14:50,459
I'm too curious for that!

298
00:14:50,539 --> 00:14:52,913
Oreki, why don't you want to think about this with me?

299
00:14:53,016 --> 00:14:54,058
Why me?

300
00:14:54,161 --> 00:14:57,911
Come on, silly, don't you think it would be
fun for us to try to figure this out together?

301
00:14:57,982 --> 00:14:58,682
Oh!

302
00:14:58,738 --> 00:15:01,431
I don't like her talking to me like I'm a little kid.

303
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:02,528
Look, Chi.

304
00:15:02,599 --> 00:15:05,181
You might want to avoid getting
your hopes up about this guy.

305
00:15:05,268 --> 00:15:07,485
He was a sloth in one of his past lives.

306
00:15:07,557 --> 00:15:10,663
What? Mayaka, you can do past life regression?

307
00:15:10,703 --> 00:15:12,618
Nice distraction, Mayaka!

308
00:15:13,054 --> 00:15:15,580
Interesting, but right now I want to know about Omichi.

309
00:15:15,605 --> 00:15:17,478
Damn! She won't be swayed.

310
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:19,807
I just... I have to know!

311
00:15:27,441 --> 00:15:31,724
Mr. Omichi always makes a point to write a
note in his textbook at the end of every class.

312
00:15:31,803 --> 00:15:33,591
Why do you think he takes the time to do that?

313
00:15:33,662 --> 00:15:37,476
So he can remember how far he got in each
lesson and pick up there for the next class.

314
00:15:37,602 --> 00:15:38,572
That's what I thought.

315
00:15:38,802 --> 00:15:42,782
He also does that weird thing where he looks at
the class plate before he comes in to the room.

316
00:15:43,044 --> 00:15:44,784
It seems like a fool-proof system,

317
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:47,143
so how is there room for any mistakes on his part?

318
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,047
He probably writes the name of the class
and the date on the page where they stopped.

319
00:15:52,301 --> 00:15:56,073
Like, on page fifteen, "Class
A, July first," or something.

320
00:15:56,344 --> 00:15:59,014
Otherwise, it would be really easy for him to lose track.

321
00:15:59,609 --> 00:16:01,945
Do you think maybe he could
have forgotten what the date was?

322
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:05,672
If that were the case, he would have
gone back a previous day, not skipped ahead.

323
00:16:05,909 --> 00:16:07,729
Use your brain a little, dummy.

324
00:16:08,295 --> 00:16:09,865
Well, she's not wrong.

325
00:16:10,836 --> 00:16:12,408
Something's bugging me about this.

326
00:16:12,433 --> 00:16:13,148
Wanna hear?

327
00:16:13,173 --> 00:16:14,317
Of course, go ahead.

328
00:16:14,507 --> 00:16:17,328
I can understand you getting
mad about something like that.

329
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,990
But I can't imagine you feeling so strongly about
it that you'd take the risk to talk back to a teacher.

330
00:16:22,245 --> 00:16:23,541
Why do you think you did?

331
00:16:23,755 --> 00:16:27,568
I was angry, but I didn't just speak
up because he was being mean to us.

332
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,602
That's not unusual for Mr. Omichi.

333
00:16:29,904 --> 00:16:33,090
Then, was it that the people who
knew the answer didn't come forward?

334
00:16:33,233 --> 00:16:34,084
No way.

335
00:16:34,647 --> 00:16:38,448
Who would have wanted to solve it in that
situation, even if they did know the answer?

336
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:41,932
Could you have been mad that no one
else had the courage to correct him?

337
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:43,949
Uh, no.

338
00:16:46,499 --> 00:16:49,057
Do you think you just felt sorry for him? Tamura?

339
00:16:50,918 --> 00:16:53,221
I mean, I did feel pretty bad for the guy.

340
00:16:53,539 --> 00:16:56,685
But I can't imagine why that would
make me mad enough to talk back.

341
00:16:56,875 --> 00:17:00,652
It's kind of a regular occurrence that a
student who doesn't know the answer to a problem

342
00:17:00,693 --> 00:17:04,129
we've already covered in class would
get berated by the teacher, isn't it?

343
00:17:04,526 --> 00:17:07,514
But as far as what made me stand up to Mr. Omichi...

344
00:17:10,606 --> 00:17:13,623
It's really hard to understand ourselves sometimes.

345
00:17:14,737 --> 00:17:15,634
You're right.

346
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,764
What pushes Chitanda's buttons?

347
00:17:17,899 --> 00:17:19,059
What makes her tick?

348
00:17:19,932 --> 00:17:23,888
I still don't feel like I know her well
enough to be able to say one way or the other.

349
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:26,536
So what's your take? What do you think?

350
00:17:29,228 --> 00:17:32,851
The clue about Omichi writing the
note in his book on the class's progress

351
00:17:32,876 --> 00:17:34,862
is the one that might lead to an answer here.

352
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:37,794
But even doing that, he still made a mistake.

353
00:17:37,928 --> 00:17:40,106
Since it's math, which is cumulative,

354
00:17:40,153 --> 00:17:44,482
they're going in order, so there had to be notes
written on the previous pages in the chapter, too.

355
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:50,122
You're absolutely 100% positive that
your class hadn't learned about ranges?

356
00:17:50,622 --> 00:17:52,238
I'm sure. Positive.

357
00:17:52,577 --> 00:17:55,581
Well, suppose you had already
learned about them, then what?

358
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,115
I don't see what you're getting at.

359
00:17:58,401 --> 00:18:01,176
Omichi teaches the same concepts every school term.

360
00:18:01,422 --> 00:18:04,368
Class 1-A had the same lesson last year, didn't they?

361
00:18:05,114 --> 00:18:09,668
If you're saying he saw the previous year's
mark and got confused, that isn't a possible answer.

362
00:18:09,731 --> 00:18:11,128
How can you be sure?

363
00:18:11,255 --> 00:18:13,370
The teachers' editions are replaced every year.

364
00:18:13,513 --> 00:18:17,381
The publishers go through and make slight
corrections, put in new problems, et cetera.

365
00:18:17,762 --> 00:18:20,115
In order to make sure they're all on the same page...

366
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,448
No pun intended... they just reissue them.

367
00:18:22,737 --> 00:18:24,461
They're currently on the fourth edition.

368
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:26,225
I can't believe you know that.

369
00:18:26,415 --> 00:18:29,198
If it weren't for us, all of
your knowledge would be useless.

370
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:31,523
Databases are never useless.

371
00:18:34,481 --> 00:18:36,984
Maybe Omichi just wrote the wrong thing in his book.

372
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:38,596
It could be the case, but...

373
00:18:39,533 --> 00:18:42,781
I doubt that answer would satisfy Chitanda's curiosity.

374
00:18:46,914 --> 00:18:49,741
I gotta admit, I don't understand ranges, either.

375
00:18:49,813 --> 00:18:54,779
It's all I can do to put X and Y in the same plane,
and even that's a chore, which is kind of pathetic.

376
00:18:55,025 --> 00:18:58,552
I'm gonna be in for a world of
pain if Omichi sets his sights on me.

377
00:18:59,012 --> 00:18:59,871
Wait a second.

378
00:19:00,482 --> 00:19:03,421
Do you mean Class 1-D has already covered the ranges unit?

379
00:19:03,829 --> 00:19:05,250
Oh, yeah. Mm-hmm.

380
00:19:05,615 --> 00:19:09,923
So Satoshi's class would have been able to
solve the problem, but Chitanda's couldn't.

381
00:19:10,177 --> 00:19:11,591
Mine wouldn't have, either.

382
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:15,666
Then that's the answer.

383
00:19:16,539 --> 00:19:19,393
Oh, man, I recognize that look. You figured it out, huh?

384
00:19:19,567 --> 00:19:20,577
I might have.

385
00:19:21,283 --> 00:19:21,948
Chitanda.

386
00:19:22,308 --> 00:19:22,904
Yes?

387
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:26,692
You're absolutely certain there was a note
in the textbook farther ahead than the point

388
00:19:26,717 --> 00:19:28,442
your class had reached, is that right?

389
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:30,118
Yes. No doubt about it.

390
00:19:30,316 --> 00:19:32,723
And it had to be one he's written this year;

391
00:19:32,748 --> 00:19:35,664
it was just not on the page where
Class 1-A had actually stopped?

392
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:36,872
Right.

393
00:19:38,016 --> 00:19:42,281
So what if we were to assume that the note was
on the correct page, just for the wrong class?

394
00:19:42,544 --> 00:19:46,167
What if the note was a progress
marker for Satoshi's, not yours?

395
00:19:46,198 --> 00:19:48,271
My class? Hmm...

396
00:19:50,973 --> 00:19:55,189
Omichi teaches math to four classes, A, B, C, and D.

397
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:57,925
Even if the note wasn't for A or B,

398
00:19:58,076 --> 00:20:00,555
that doesn't mean it has to be for Class D.

399
00:20:00,706 --> 00:20:03,820
And even if it was for that class, why would it matter?

400
00:20:04,906 --> 00:20:06,365
Well, if that were the case,

401
00:20:06,448 --> 00:20:09,198
it makes sense that he would
mistake the mark for Class A's.

402
00:20:10,636 --> 00:20:13,409
There's not much chance he'd
confuse a C for a D, is there?

403
00:20:13,806 --> 00:20:16,309
Huh? Now you're talking nonsense again.

404
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,970
No one would mistake an A for a D, either.

405
00:20:18,995 --> 00:20:20,673
But Omichi is a mathematician.

406
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:22,260
Yeah, so what?

407
00:20:22,667 --> 00:20:23,948
That's why it's likely.

408
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:27,203
It's really easy to mistake
those two letters when you do math.

409
00:20:27,818 --> 00:20:28,687
How?

410
00:20:30,762 --> 00:20:32,795
Let's say on page 10 Omichi wrote,

411
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:34,536
"July first, Class A,"

412
00:20:34,972 --> 00:20:39,237
then on page 15 he would have written,
"July first, Class D." Does that make sense?

413
00:20:39,262 --> 00:20:41,708
Okay, so what exactly are you getting at?

414
00:20:41,733 --> 00:20:43,687
Why would anyone confuse one for the other?

415
00:20:43,712 --> 00:20:45,348
Just assume he did for a sec.

416
00:20:45,499 --> 00:20:48,241
If so, then what went down today is pretty likely, right?

417
00:20:48,266 --> 00:20:48,925
Huh?

418
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:52,047
Wait... I don't get how that would ever happen.

419
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:55,709
'Cause when you write equations,
A and D would look like this.

420
00:20:59,031 --> 00:21:02,066
I get it! He thought a lowercase D was an A!

421
00:21:02,098 --> 00:21:03,194
You solved it!

422
00:21:04,759 --> 00:21:06,031
I guess you're right.

423
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:11,900
One time, on an English test, I lost points because the
teacher couldn't tell some of my lowercase letters apart.

424
00:21:11,925 --> 00:21:13,781
Same here. It's difficult.

425
00:21:14,077 --> 00:21:17,327
On my test, the teacher couldn't
distinguish the Ns from the Hs.

426
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:19,934
That's what happened. It seems so obvious now.

427
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:22,023
Man. I'm glad that's settled.

428
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:24,929
Huh?

429
00:21:25,527 --> 00:21:26,709
D and A.

430
00:21:27,211 --> 00:21:29,156
I can't blame him for mixing those up.

431
00:21:29,478 --> 00:21:30,666
I feel bad now.

432
00:21:30,801 --> 00:21:34,156
I guess I was a bit out of line
for getting so mad and yelling, huh?

433
00:21:34,314 --> 00:21:36,498
I'm surprised I didn't get in trouble for it.

434
00:21:38,652 --> 00:21:40,693
What?! How can you say that?

435
00:21:40,797 --> 00:21:44,151
He was a total "D" and screamed
at the class for no good reason!

436
00:21:44,262 --> 00:21:45,627
You have to stand up for what's right!

437
00:21:45,652 --> 00:21:46,490
Hey, calm down.

438
00:21:46,692 --> 00:21:48,368
Just look at how late it's gotten.

439
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:50,077
Don't you think it's time we headed home?

440
00:21:50,307 --> 00:21:52,292
But wait... I wasn't finished.

441
00:21:52,317 --> 00:21:54,152
I know, but why does it matter?

442
00:21:54,247 --> 00:21:55,630
The mystery's been solved.

443
00:21:55,749 --> 00:21:58,442
Hey! I'm not done with you!

444
00:22:00,262 --> 00:22:04,703
Chitanda, who's usually slow to
anger, got mad today and had to know why.

445
00:22:04,996 --> 00:22:08,279
She said herself that wrath isn't necessarily a bad thing.

446
00:22:08,402 --> 00:22:09,559
But I wonder...

447
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:13,004
For some reason, she still
seems to avoid getting riled up.

448
00:22:13,632 --> 00:22:19,670
Could her quest to pinpoint the cause of her anger have
been motivated by some desire to let Omichi off the hook?

449
00:22:20,211 --> 00:22:24,231
Did she just want to find some proof that
she was wrong to get mad in the first place?

450
00:22:24,731 --> 00:22:28,902
Is that the kind of person Eru
Chitanda really is, at her core?

451
00:22:29,196 --> 00:22:30,229
Nah.

452
00:22:31,175 --> 00:22:34,441
Who am I kidding. I don't truly know her at all.

453
00:22:36,427 --> 00:22:39,865
Even if I knew her well enough to
make predictions about her behavior,

454
00:22:39,907 --> 00:22:42,885
if I ever presumed to be able to read her mind, well...

455
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:44,752
I know what that'd be.

456
00:22:45,468 --> 00:22:48,198
A cardinal sin. Pride.

457
00:22:48,517 --> 00:22:50,226
One of the seven deadly ones.

458
00:22:50,281 --> 00:22:52,618
Avoid those at all costs, they say.

459
00:22:52,888 --> 00:22:54,128
I mean, come on.

460
00:22:54,255 --> 00:22:56,320
How many times has Chitanda surprised me,

461
00:22:56,439 --> 00:22:57,878
in this afternoon alone?

462
00:22:58,386 --> 00:22:59,498
Hey, Oreki.

463
00:23:00,054 --> 00:23:01,612
Aren't you coming with us?

464
00:23:01,858 --> 00:23:03,851
Oh. Of course. I'm sorry.

465
00:23:05,353 --> 00:23:06,958
Hey, listen.

466
00:23:07,474 --> 00:23:09,724
Thank you for your help with everything.

467
00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:14,411
I mean it feels like you're always
solving these mysteries for me, doesn't it?

468
00:23:15,276 --> 00:23:17,490
Yeah, and it's becoming a real hassle.

469
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:23,484
What are you guys still waiting around for?

470
00:23:23,651 --> 00:23:25,169
Yeah, you wanna live at the school?

471
00:23:25,938 --> 00:23:27,813
No. We're right behind you.

472
00:23:28,155 --> 00:23:29,696
Well, should we be going, then?

473
00:23:29,974 --> 00:23:30,641
Sure.

474
00:23:36,314 --> 00:23:38,803
I guess tomorrow I'll pick up where I left off.

475
00:23:39,978 --> 00:23:41,073
C'mon, Oreki!

476
00:23:41,654 --> 00:23:43,926
That may be true for you, Mayaka.

477
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:45,745
Think about it from her perspective.

478
00:23:48,829 --> 00:23:53,190
And so, another afternoon of my high
school life is spent squandering my energy.

479
00:23:53,571 --> 00:23:56,255
I've got my hands full with one deadly sin, sloth.

480
00:23:56,516 --> 00:23:57,849
That's plenty for now.

481
00:25:36,634 --> 00:25:37,492
Next time:

482
00:25:37,562 --> 00:25:39,873
"Upon Seeing The True Nature."
