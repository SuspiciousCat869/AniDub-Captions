1
00:00:01,532 --> 00:00:04,333
All right, everyone! Are you ready?

2
00:00:06,223 --> 00:00:10,081
Who's our next quiz king? Do you wanna know?

3
00:00:10,138 --> 00:00:11,980
Yeah!

4
00:00:12,072 --> 00:00:14,579
Then let's get started with the prelim round!

5
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:16,022
You with me?

6
00:00:16,168 --> 00:00:17,939
Yeah!

7
00:00:18,027 --> 00:00:23,872
Quiz... trial... 7!

8
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,224
Yeah!

9
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,654
Question number one!

10
00:02:04,357 --> 00:02:07,579
Here we go: "The term "adamant" refers to a diamond,

11
00:02:07,643 --> 00:02:10,114
while the term "beryl" refers to an emerald."

12
00:02:10,147 --> 00:02:13,410
So is this true, or is it false?

13
00:02:21,912 --> 00:02:24,573
Not a terrible first question, I guess.

14
00:02:25,716 --> 00:02:27,408
The answer is...

15
00:02:34,251 --> 00:02:35,305
...it's true!

16
00:02:37,356 --> 00:02:39,731
Time to show off my database skills.

17
00:02:39,814 --> 00:02:41,008
Let's do this.

18
00:02:42,272 --> 00:02:44,481
There aren't very many contestants left now.

19
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:47,397
Will question 7 be the last of the prelim round?

20
00:02:47,481 --> 00:02:48,485
Let's see!

21
00:02:51,064 --> 00:02:53,119
The word "darui," or "listless",

22
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:55,215
derives from the English word "dull."

23
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,464
Is this true, or is it false?

24
00:02:58,337 --> 00:02:59,426
What do you think?

25
00:02:59,591 --> 00:03:02,763
Well, it makes sense that it would be, but I don't know.

26
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:04,094
What's your answer, Mayaka?

27
00:03:04,119 --> 00:03:04,483
Huh?

28
00:03:04,689 --> 00:03:06,469
Do you think it's true or false?

29
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:09,772
Maybe... it's true?

30
00:03:09,848 --> 00:03:11,348
The answer is...

31
00:03:14,022 --> 00:03:15,564
The suspense is killing me!

32
00:03:15,647 --> 00:03:17,050
...false!

33
00:03:17,607 --> 00:03:19,856
And that's it for the preliminaries!

34
00:03:19,928 --> 00:03:21,147
Wa-hoo!

35
00:03:21,172 --> 00:03:23,481
If you answered correctly, congratulations!

36
00:03:23,564 --> 00:03:26,673
The championship round will be held right over here!

37
00:03:27,633 --> 00:03:28,883
Come on up!

38
00:03:30,356 --> 00:03:31,168
Yo!

39
00:03:33,824 --> 00:03:34,640
Wow, man.

40
00:03:34,665 --> 00:03:36,889
That's one serious hat you're rockin' there.

41
00:03:38,082 --> 00:03:39,185
Who's he again?

42
00:03:40,061 --> 00:03:40,909
Oh, yeah. Thanks.

43
00:03:40,981 --> 00:03:44,022
You didn't even realize I was competing, did you?

44
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:46,890
I was pretty focused on the quiz.

45
00:03:47,332 --> 00:03:49,211
Oh, I remember him!

46
00:03:49,493 --> 00:03:51,499
So, Tani, how's the Go Club?

47
00:03:53,077 --> 00:03:54,137
The Go Club.

48
00:03:55,545 --> 00:03:58,253
I've got a funny story about that, actually.

49
00:03:59,575 --> 00:04:00,658
Wanna hear it?

50
00:04:01,022 --> 00:04:01,931
Fantastic!

51
00:04:01,956 --> 00:04:03,489
Now, let's hear from our third finalist.

52
00:04:03,522 --> 00:04:04,782
Yeah, I'm coming!

53
00:04:05,689 --> 00:04:06,731
We should go.

54
00:04:06,814 --> 00:04:07,786
Whoa!

55
00:04:07,951 --> 00:04:11,050
Looks like there's a giant Saturn on his head!

56
00:04:14,564 --> 00:04:16,372
Please tell us your name and class.

57
00:04:16,397 --> 00:04:18,856
Hello, folks. Satoshi Fukube!

58
00:04:18,881 --> 00:04:19,575
Ooh!

59
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,289
From the Classic Lit Club!

60
00:04:21,314 --> 00:04:22,414
Wow!

61
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:24,497
We have a Classic Lit Club? Who knew?

62
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:27,561
Based on that outfit, your club must be wild, huh?

63
00:04:27,939 --> 00:04:28,648
Yeah!

64
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:32,120
Sure! We are totally wild!

65
00:04:32,356 --> 00:04:35,147
I mean really, we've done a
lot of awesome stuff this year.

66
00:04:35,231 --> 00:04:35,939
You have?

67
00:04:36,022 --> 00:04:37,142
Please, tell us more!

68
00:04:37,167 --> 00:04:39,772
Well, we knew that we needed to create an anthology,

69
00:04:39,797 --> 00:04:41,789
and we wanted to make the most of it.

70
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:44,833
Honestly, I think the results are pretty amazing.

71
00:04:44,913 --> 00:04:46,939
We put everything into it!

72
00:04:47,006 --> 00:04:50,958
Oh, yeah. We put everything into it, money-wise.

73
00:04:50,983 --> 00:04:55,566
As a matter of fact, we uncovered a
long-buried secret about this very festival!

74
00:04:57,231 --> 00:04:58,981
Please, tell us more!

75
00:04:59,064 --> 00:05:01,543
We found the origin of the term "Kanyasai."

76
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:05,968
It is not just a simple abbreviation of
"Kamiyama High School Cultural Festival."

77
00:05:06,064 --> 00:05:07,898
The Classic Lit Club...

78
00:05:12,689 --> 00:05:14,286
...has found the truth!

79
00:05:15,809 --> 00:05:17,693
What is the name's origin?

80
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:20,259
To find out...

81
00:05:22,429 --> 00:05:24,835
...buy our anthology!

82
00:05:24,966 --> 00:05:28,856
For the low price of 200 yen,
you can learn the 45-year-old secret

83
00:05:28,881 --> 00:05:30,939
of Kami High's cultural festival.

84
00:05:30,993 --> 00:05:34,231
Purchase your copy of <i>Hyouka</i>
now in the Earth Science Prep Room

85
00:05:34,256 --> 00:05:36,951
on the 4th floor of the auxiliary building!

86
00:05:43,647 --> 00:05:45,141
Pitch successful!

87
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,081
At this point, winning is just gravy.

88
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:51,040
I'm here, Oreki!

89
00:05:54,897 --> 00:05:55,827
How'd it go?

90
00:05:58,442 --> 00:06:00,133
I talked to Tanabe.

91
00:06:00,261 --> 00:06:04,226
He said we could ask other clubs to
sell copies for us at their booths.

92
00:06:04,327 --> 00:06:08,064
My first thought was to find Irisu and
ask if she would consider helping us out,

93
00:06:08,147 --> 00:06:09,762
but I never quite made it there.

94
00:06:09,914 --> 00:06:12,247
Yeah. I think I can see why.

95
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,623
What should we do now?

96
00:06:15,237 --> 00:06:18,564
Satoshi's plug was pretty
effective. Maybe that'll do the trick.

97
00:06:18,647 --> 00:06:20,124
Huh? A plug!

98
00:06:23,147 --> 00:06:24,011
That's it!

99
00:06:24,036 --> 00:06:27,306
I heard the Wall Newspaper Club
is putting out an extra edition!

100
00:06:27,506 --> 00:06:30,610
I'll go ask them if they'll
cover the Classic Lit Club in it.

101
00:06:32,482 --> 00:06:34,009
Always on the move.

102
00:06:41,894 --> 00:06:43,250
Excuse me!

103
00:06:44,019 --> 00:06:45,841
Hey, Chitanda. Need something?

104
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,438
Actually, yes. I could use your help.

105
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:51,346
Could you cover the Classic Lit Club in your extra?

106
00:06:51,528 --> 00:06:52,250
Huh?

107
00:06:56,645 --> 00:06:57,726
I'm confused.

108
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,450
What is it that you want, exactly?

109
00:07:00,782 --> 00:07:01,882
A small favor.

110
00:07:02,247 --> 00:07:04,029
The club's run into some trouble.

111
00:07:04,092 --> 00:07:08,270
I was hoping you might write a promotional
article for us and publish it in the wall newspaper.

112
00:07:08,555 --> 00:07:10,071
Oh. Uh...

113
00:07:11,064 --> 00:07:11,995
I dunno.

114
00:07:12,074 --> 00:07:14,355
The thing is, I'm not really in the club anymore.

115
00:07:14,473 --> 00:07:16,826
Since it's my last year of school, I've retired.

116
00:07:17,641 --> 00:07:18,978
All right, I'm sorry.

117
00:07:19,425 --> 00:07:23,663
Well, then, is there a chance you could
introduce me to the people who are running it now?

118
00:07:23,731 --> 00:07:27,082
Sure, I don't mind doing that,
but it may not do you any good.

119
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,967
The one-page extra is set to run in two hours.

120
00:07:29,992 --> 00:07:32,493
So the layout is pretty much fixed at this point.

121
00:07:32,691 --> 00:07:34,804
So it's impossible to add anything?

122
00:07:35,223 --> 00:07:36,458
For today, anyway.

123
00:07:37,131 --> 00:07:41,043
But they might have some room available if
you can wait until the afternoon on day 2.

124
00:07:41,367 --> 00:07:43,909
That said, there are more than 50 clubs at Kanyasai,

125
00:07:43,961 --> 00:07:47,416
and the paper gives priority to
those that deserve the most attention.

126
00:07:48,133 --> 00:07:50,092
And I'm not sure your club makes the cut.

127
00:07:50,231 --> 00:07:53,357
No offense, but all you're doing
is publishing an anthology, right?

128
00:07:53,522 --> 00:07:56,812
Yes, but, there's important information in it.

129
00:07:56,873 --> 00:07:59,540
Come on, every club thinks that what it does is important.

130
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:03,479
Tell you what: if you can come up with a story
that's actually going to capture people's interest,

131
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:05,614
I'll personally ask them to run it, okay?

132
00:08:06,562 --> 00:08:08,299
Yes. I understand.

133
00:08:08,851 --> 00:08:09,857
Well, thank you,

134
00:08:10,381 --> 00:08:12,805
and I'm sorry for taking up so much of your time.

135
00:08:13,314 --> 00:08:16,022
Remember, if you come up with an interesting story,

136
00:08:16,047 --> 00:08:17,094
drop by again.

137
00:08:17,272 --> 00:08:18,700
I may be able to help you out.

138
00:08:20,603 --> 00:08:21,274
Eru?

139
00:08:26,316 --> 00:08:27,448
Hi, Kaho!

140
00:08:28,606 --> 00:08:29,772
Long time no see.

141
00:08:29,856 --> 00:08:31,564
How is Uncle Jumonji doing,

142
00:08:31,707 --> 00:08:33,273
after everything that happened?

143
00:08:33,352 --> 00:08:34,663
He's doing fine now.

144
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:37,294
How about you, though? You look kinda stressed.

145
00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:39,802
I guess so. I've got a lot going on.

146
00:08:41,663 --> 00:08:45,046
Well, maybe I can help.

147
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,085
I'll tell your fortune if you want.

148
00:08:47,168 --> 00:08:49,599
This is a pretty amazing setup you've got here.

149
00:08:50,004 --> 00:08:51,489
A lot of options, too.

150
00:08:51,695 --> 00:08:53,833
I think I'd like to try a tarot reading.

151
00:08:54,272 --> 00:08:57,305
Oh. I'm sorry, I can't do that.

152
00:08:57,384 --> 00:08:59,330
Really? But why not?

153
00:09:00,897 --> 00:09:04,505
Eru... You like a good mystery, right?

154
00:09:13,772 --> 00:09:14,802
What is that?

155
00:09:15,133 --> 00:09:18,966
I'm running this all by myself, so I
have to leave the booth unattended sometimes.

156
00:09:19,106 --> 00:09:24,174
I stepped out for a little bit, and when I came back,
the Wheel of Fortune card was missing from my Tarot deck.

157
00:09:24,278 --> 00:09:26,647
And that card had been left in its place.

158
00:09:26,855 --> 00:09:31,200
It says "Jumonji." I don't get it. Why
would your last name be written on here?

159
00:09:31,326 --> 00:09:33,255
Good question. I wish I knew.

160
00:09:34,013 --> 00:09:36,864
Have you been able to track
down the card that disappeared yet?

161
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:38,981
I think I'll get it back eventually.

162
00:09:39,064 --> 00:09:40,597
This note was left here, too.

163
00:09:44,109 --> 00:09:47,453
I don't think I've ever heard of a
thief who puts things back before.

164
00:09:49,856 --> 00:09:52,794
Here. If you don't mind, there's
one more thing I'd like to show you.

165
00:09:53,066 --> 00:09:55,980
A festival guidebook? Is there something special about it?

166
00:09:56,106 --> 00:09:58,824
As far as I can tell, it's the same as all the others.

167
00:09:58,939 --> 00:10:01,365
I found it here the same time I found that card.

168
00:10:02,272 --> 00:10:06,467
When I noticed it, it was open to the last
page... the one with all the club comments on it.

169
00:10:14,276 --> 00:10:16,708
This is so strange. What do you think it means?

170
00:10:16,814 --> 00:10:17,981
I have no idea,

171
00:10:18,006 --> 00:10:21,856
but as long as I get my Wheel of Fortune
back safely, I'm willing to let it go at that.

172
00:10:23,092 --> 00:10:24,988
It's almost time to crown a winner!

173
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,722
So is everybody ready?

174
00:10:26,873 --> 00:10:29,213
Shimizu and Goto both have 5 points.

175
00:10:29,364 --> 00:10:34,519
Meanwhile... Tani and Fukube have 6 points,
and both of them seem eager to clinch the title.

176
00:10:35,192 --> 00:10:38,294
Which of our four competitors will be the champion?

177
00:10:38,373 --> 00:10:41,081
Before we find out, let's give them all a hand!

178
00:10:42,982 --> 00:10:44,959
All right, on to the next question.

179
00:10:45,106 --> 00:10:46,429
Get ready!

180
00:10:48,091 --> 00:10:51,340
The formula to determine the surface area of a sphere...

181
00:10:52,325 --> 00:10:54,825
...is 4 pi r squared.

182
00:10:54,925 --> 00:10:57,194
Oho! Quick one!

183
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:01,183
I haven't even finished the
question yet! Are you sure about this?

184
00:11:01,272 --> 00:11:02,009
I'm sure.

185
00:11:02,092 --> 00:11:05,338
All right, then. Shimizu, what's your answer?

186
00:11:12,856 --> 00:11:15,777
The answer is 4/3 pi r cubed.

187
00:11:22,055 --> 00:11:23,619
Correct!

188
00:11:23,788 --> 00:11:24,872
Hooray!

189
00:11:26,075 --> 00:11:31,062
The formula used to determine the
surface area of a sphere is 4 pi r squared.

190
00:11:31,087 --> 00:11:34,416
Now, please tell us the formula
used to determine its volume.

191
00:11:34,475 --> 00:11:37,482
That formula is 4/3 pi r cubed.

192
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:40,852
Quite impressive! Shimizu now has 6 points.

193
00:11:40,887 --> 00:11:43,520
Three contestants are a step away from winning!

194
00:11:43,647 --> 00:11:45,904
It's almost too exciting to handle!

195
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:48,121
You hang in there, Goto!

196
00:11:50,766 --> 00:11:53,271
All right. On to our next question.

197
00:11:53,356 --> 00:11:55,382
Get ready!

198
00:11:56,032 --> 00:11:59,205
Kami High School's student
council president's full name...

199
00:12:01,543 --> 00:12:03,749
...is what, contestants?

200
00:12:04,856 --> 00:12:07,094
Yes? What is your answer?

201
00:12:07,856 --> 00:12:09,897
Muneyoshi Kugayama.

202
00:12:14,766 --> 00:12:17,104
Seriously, can we just get on with it?

203
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,778
Correct!

204
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:21,439
Let's give it up for...

205
00:12:21,522 --> 00:12:23,064
Oh, well. Good game.

206
00:12:23,147 --> 00:12:24,929
Huh? Yeah.

207
00:12:25,059 --> 00:12:27,345
It was a close one. For both of us.

208
00:12:27,439 --> 00:12:29,886
You're right. Then I guess we're even.

209
00:12:30,814 --> 00:12:32,763
Yep. Guess we are.

210
00:12:32,886 --> 00:12:35,345
I never did finish telling you that story.

211
00:12:35,784 --> 00:12:38,174
Some of our Go stones were stolen from our room.

212
00:12:38,272 --> 00:12:39,062
Really?

213
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:41,669
You sure they were stolen and not just lost?

214
00:12:41,897 --> 00:12:44,564
There was a strange note left in the Go stone bowl saying,

215
00:12:44,589 --> 00:12:46,540
"We've taken some stones from the Go Club."

216
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:50,369
And it's not like we use all of
them, so they could easily take 10,

217
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:52,189
and nobody would notice they were missing.

218
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:54,828
But what's the point of stealing them in the first place?

219
00:12:54,853 --> 00:12:58,116
I'd say they're probably using them to play Five-in-a-Row.

220
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:01,342
It sounds like some other club is messing with you.

221
00:13:03,081 --> 00:13:03,956
Well... bye.

222
00:13:03,989 --> 00:13:05,560
Not so fast, Fukube.

223
00:13:05,939 --> 00:13:08,022
I can't just let this end in a tie.

224
00:13:08,147 --> 00:13:10,987
Let's settle it for good. Where are you competing next?

225
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,300
I'm doing the cooking club tomorrow.

226
00:13:15,522 --> 00:13:16,944
You're on!

227
00:13:16,981 --> 00:13:19,648
The Cooking Club will decide who the true winner is.

228
00:13:20,544 --> 00:13:22,508
Looking forward to it!

229
00:13:24,981 --> 00:13:25,752
You're the winner!

230
00:13:25,777 --> 00:13:26,664
What's his deal?

231
00:13:26,689 --> 00:13:27,539
How does it feel?

232
00:13:27,857 --> 00:13:30,454
I couldn't care less about competing against Tani.

233
00:13:31,981 --> 00:13:34,132
I wonder if Hotaro is hard at work...

234
00:13:53,564 --> 00:13:54,431
You open?

235
00:13:56,356 --> 00:13:58,403
Oh, yeah. Sure, we're open.

236
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:01,317
I hear there are some cool
Kanyasai facts in your little book.

237
00:14:01,401 --> 00:14:02,725
You mind if I look through it?

238
00:14:02,856 --> 00:14:04,039
I do, actually.

239
00:14:04,064 --> 00:14:06,272
They're cheap enough, okay? Please buy one.

240
00:14:06,356 --> 00:14:08,556
We've got so many copies, its killing us.

241
00:14:12,231 --> 00:14:14,802
I don't know if you realized,
man, but your fly's unzipped.

242
00:14:15,168 --> 00:14:16,995
Huh? Oh, crap!

243
00:14:18,647 --> 00:14:19,489
Aww...

244
00:14:19,772 --> 00:14:21,315
The whole zipper's torn off.

245
00:14:21,481 --> 00:14:22,952
What am I gonna do?

246
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,773
You can have this if you want. It might help.

247
00:14:33,311 --> 00:14:34,336
Oh, hey!

248
00:14:34,443 --> 00:14:36,434
Lucky you've got one of these hanging around.

249
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:38,800
You're a lifesaver.

250
00:14:41,426 --> 00:14:42,440
I'll tell ya what.

251
00:14:42,862 --> 00:14:44,005
Take this.

252
00:14:45,481 --> 00:14:47,104
That's not a real gun, is it?

253
00:14:47,191 --> 00:14:49,316
Of course not. It's a water gun.

254
00:14:51,481 --> 00:14:52,814
I'm in the gardening club.

255
00:14:52,897 --> 00:14:54,668
We've been roasting sweet potatoes.

256
00:14:54,731 --> 00:14:57,481
These seemed like a cooler way
to put out fires than buckets.

257
00:14:57,564 --> 00:14:59,952
In that case, shouldn't you probably hang onto this?

258
00:15:00,064 --> 00:15:02,390
Nah, I'm good. That's just my sidearm.

259
00:15:03,134 --> 00:15:04,801
This is my main weapon right here.

260
00:15:04,922 --> 00:15:06,163
AK, baby.

261
00:15:06,831 --> 00:15:07,762
"Baby"?

262
00:15:07,892 --> 00:15:10,009
Well, later, man. Thanks for the help.

263
00:15:12,976 --> 00:15:16,008
A Glock 17. Just what I always wanted.

264
00:15:20,981 --> 00:15:22,708
I'm telling you... it's no use.

265
00:15:22,779 --> 00:15:24,725
This collection was doomed from the start.

266
00:15:25,064 --> 00:15:27,044
We're not exactly drawing a crowd.

267
00:15:27,189 --> 00:15:28,862
We should start making up posters.

268
00:15:29,106 --> 00:15:31,747
Maybe that way, we can at least get a few customers.

269
00:15:34,564 --> 00:15:35,433
I know.

270
00:15:35,647 --> 00:15:39,635
It's frustrating, but we all decided
that this is what we wanted to do.

271
00:15:44,676 --> 00:15:47,143
Why is everybody looking at me?

272
00:15:47,528 --> 00:15:49,706
I mean, 100 manga reviews?

273
00:15:49,731 --> 00:15:52,959
It's not like this is classic
literature we're talking about, here.

274
00:15:53,231 --> 00:15:55,831
Please, Kochi. Just stop.

275
00:15:55,856 --> 00:15:58,872
I don't see why anyone would
bother to read reviews of manga.

276
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:01,106
It's a waste of time. Right?

277
00:16:01,189 --> 00:16:04,115
I... um, I don't know.

278
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:16,112
There's probably no chance Fuku will believe me,

279
00:16:16,137 --> 00:16:18,947
but I really was trying to behave myself.

280
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:24,914
What do you mean, "why would anyone bother?"

281
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:26,582
I'm confused.

282
00:16:29,957 --> 00:16:32,699
The fact is, all manga is basically the same.

283
00:16:36,925 --> 00:16:38,091
Are you serious?

284
00:16:38,231 --> 00:16:39,253
Sure, I am.

285
00:16:40,485 --> 00:16:45,014
One manga is just as good as another,
so reviewing them is totally pointless.

286
00:16:47,941 --> 00:16:49,774
You don't think the writing matters?

287
00:16:49,957 --> 00:16:50,847
No, I don't.

288
00:16:51,136 --> 00:16:54,866
If that's true, how are people supposed
to decide which one they want to read?

289
00:16:56,494 --> 00:16:58,561
This isn't rocket science, Ibara.

290
00:16:58,647 --> 00:17:00,531
People read what they're into.

291
00:17:00,647 --> 00:17:05,536
Just think about it: a sports fan will read
about sports, and a romantic will read about romance.

292
00:17:05,729 --> 00:17:07,251
It's as simple as that.

293
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:16,772
You're saying that people will read about what interests
them, without caring whether or not it's any good.

294
00:17:16,864 --> 00:17:18,161
Exactly!

295
00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:21,901
Which is why I don't think
there's any point in writing reviews.

296
00:17:22,147 --> 00:17:23,814
Everyone should just read what they like.

297
00:17:23,897 --> 00:17:26,041
This is entertainment, not fine art.

298
00:17:27,022 --> 00:17:29,314
All manga is basically the same?

299
00:17:29,437 --> 00:17:31,659
I can't let that statement stand.

300
00:17:31,863 --> 00:17:33,246
I'll prove her wrong.

301
00:17:33,897 --> 00:17:35,147
Let me clarify.

302
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:40,647
To you, no manga stands out above the rest, meaning
there are no works that can be considered masterpieces.

303
00:17:40,746 --> 00:17:42,114
There are masterpieces.

304
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:43,774
And how would you define them?

305
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:51,081
Well, there are series that go on for many years
without losing popularity, even gaining readers over time.

306
00:17:51,193 --> 00:17:52,886
That makes them masterpieces.

307
00:17:55,196 --> 00:17:56,422
I think you're wrong.

308
00:17:57,516 --> 00:17:59,808
A masterpiece is a masterpiece from the beginning.

309
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:01,106
It doesn't become one.

310
00:18:01,189 --> 00:18:05,615
I don't see how a manga can possibly deserve
that title until it's stood the test of time.

311
00:18:05,676 --> 00:18:06,676
That's just ignorant!

312
00:18:06,701 --> 00:18:07,689
Excuse me?

313
00:18:07,792 --> 00:18:09,779
It's a matter of personal experience.

314
00:18:09,843 --> 00:18:12,917
Tell me this... Have you ever read
something that really got to you?

315
00:18:13,022 --> 00:18:15,189
That made you laugh or cry so much it hurt?

316
00:18:15,272 --> 00:18:16,500
Wow, Ibara.

317
00:18:18,481 --> 00:18:20,039
Aren't you a passionate one...

318
00:18:20,189 --> 00:18:23,702
There's a big gap between the
skill and talent of different artists.

319
00:18:29,481 --> 00:18:30,661
For example...

320
00:18:31,189 --> 00:18:33,856
There was a manga sold at last year's cultural festival

321
00:18:33,911 --> 00:18:37,142
that was titled <i>A Corpse by Evening</i>. Have you read it?

322
00:18:43,897 --> 00:18:45,007
No, I haven't.

323
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:47,432
Okay, then I'll bring it in tomorrow.

324
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:49,704
And if reading that still doesn't convince you,

325
00:18:49,827 --> 00:18:51,689
then nothing I could say ever would.

326
00:18:52,522 --> 00:18:53,334
Nice.

327
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:57,203
That pretty much guarantees I won't
be able to leave copies of <i>Hyouka</i> here.

328
00:18:57,647 --> 00:18:58,622
I'll take one, please.

329
00:18:58,647 --> 00:19:00,564
Here you go. Thanks a lot.

330
00:19:00,647 --> 00:19:02,041
Were they all listening?

331
00:19:05,757 --> 00:19:07,585
Hi! Thanks for coming!

332
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,157
Battle of the Maidens? Sounds interesting.

333
00:19:15,925 --> 00:19:16,904
Excuse me.

334
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:17,989
What's up?

335
00:19:18,018 --> 00:19:18,809
What is that?

336
00:19:18,981 --> 00:19:20,439
Sorry, it's over now.

337
00:19:20,553 --> 00:19:22,345
They'll go at it again tomorrow, though.

338
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,205
So feel free to stop by then.

339
00:19:24,347 --> 00:19:25,277
Sure.

340
00:19:28,864 --> 00:19:30,647
So... What did you think?

341
00:19:30,731 --> 00:19:32,072
About my plug, I mean.

342
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:34,272
Did it help our situation at all?

343
00:19:34,356 --> 00:19:35,750
Yeah, I suppose.

344
00:19:35,998 --> 00:19:37,165
We sold 14.

345
00:19:37,303 --> 00:19:38,762
Yeah? That many?

346
00:19:38,814 --> 00:19:41,231
Guess this means publicity really works.

347
00:19:41,337 --> 00:19:43,535
It looks like we're off to a pretty good start.

348
00:19:43,772 --> 00:19:45,362
I'll try to do it again tomorrow.

349
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:48,509
The cooking contest should give me a nice opportunity.

350
00:19:49,284 --> 00:19:51,679
You mean the "three-person team" competition?

351
00:19:51,888 --> 00:19:52,449
Huh?

352
00:19:52,896 --> 00:19:55,811
It's a team competition?! Seriously?

353
00:19:57,606 --> 00:20:00,826
Shouldn't someone on the executive
committee know these little details?

354
00:20:00,897 --> 00:20:02,064
I struck out.

355
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:05,036
I didn't increase our number of outlets,

356
00:20:05,189 --> 00:20:07,897
and I couldn't get the newspaper to do a story on us.

357
00:20:07,933 --> 00:20:09,141
I'm sorry I failed.

358
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,763
Don't beat yourself up.

359
00:20:12,442 --> 00:20:13,203
Although...

360
00:20:13,995 --> 00:20:16,581
I did hear something that I'm kind of curious about.

361
00:20:16,606 --> 00:20:17,841
Of course you did.

362
00:20:21,981 --> 00:20:22,895
Never mind.

363
00:20:23,707 --> 00:20:26,240
It's nothing. Just forget about it.

364
00:20:26,389 --> 00:20:27,852
That's a great idea.

365
00:20:28,542 --> 00:20:29,401
See?

366
00:20:29,482 --> 00:20:31,814
It doesn't say anything about three-person teams!

367
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,397
I don't know what to tell ya.

368
00:20:33,481 --> 00:20:36,206
I heard it straight from one
of the girls in the Cooking Club.

369
00:20:36,239 --> 00:20:38,681
Aww... What am I gonna do?

370
00:20:38,828 --> 00:20:40,412
I thought I could enter on my own.

371
00:20:42,605 --> 00:20:44,100
What about you, Mayaka?

372
00:20:44,314 --> 00:20:45,800
How did it go with the Manga Club?

373
00:20:45,966 --> 00:20:47,769
Just fine, thank you very much.

374
00:20:51,772 --> 00:20:54,031
Ladies... Can I ask a favor?

375
00:20:54,482 --> 00:20:57,901
Would you please consider entering
the Cooking Club contest with me?

376
00:21:02,897 --> 00:21:06,584
I can ask the Manga Club president if
she'll give me time away from our booth.

377
00:21:06,647 --> 00:21:09,166
If it'll help with publicity, I'm definitely in.

378
00:21:09,397 --> 00:21:10,088
Great!

379
00:21:10,113 --> 00:21:12,130
If we work hard, I know we can win it!

380
00:21:12,189 --> 00:21:14,125
It sounds like you're really invested in this.

381
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:16,818
Well, I am fairly proud of my cooking ability.

382
00:21:16,981 --> 00:21:20,281
And honestly, I would hate to
pass up a chance to show it off.

383
00:21:27,856 --> 00:21:30,093
Attention, all students and visitors.

384
00:21:30,147 --> 00:21:32,358
We hope you had an excellent time.

385
00:21:32,707 --> 00:21:36,299
This announcement marks the
end of our Kanyasai's first day,

386
00:21:36,486 --> 00:21:38,861
and what a fantastic one it was!

387
00:21:40,881 --> 00:21:42,751
Oreki, this envelope...

388
00:21:43,683 --> 00:21:45,724
You didn't look, right?

389
00:21:45,879 --> 00:21:47,898
Uh... No way.

390
00:21:49,378 --> 00:21:52,195
Yeah. Of course. I was just checking.

391
00:22:07,814 --> 00:22:08,978
Where is it?

392
00:22:10,606 --> 00:22:11,741
Not here.

393
00:22:13,598 --> 00:22:15,157
Where could it have gone?

394
00:23:05,314 --> 00:23:07,611
I guess I'll bring this instead.

395
00:23:08,147 --> 00:23:09,817
No! I'll find it!

396
00:23:53,357 --> 00:23:54,889
I've looked everywhere.

397
00:23:56,231 --> 00:23:57,375
Where is it?

398
00:25:36,897 --> 00:25:37,777
Next time:

399
00:25:38,055 --> 00:25:39,277
"Wild Fire."
