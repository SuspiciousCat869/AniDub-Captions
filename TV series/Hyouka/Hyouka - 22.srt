6
00:00:22,331 --> 00:00:22,956
No.

40
00:01:41,521 --> 00:01:42,552
Oh.

92
00:05:38,467 --> 00:05:39,152
Oh.

125
00:06:59,834 --> 00:07:00,221
Hm?

145
00:07:34,676 --> 00:07:35,274
Oh.

298
00:16:09,076 --> 00:16:09,763
Oh.

24
00:01:05,176 --> 00:01:05,857
Yes.

33
00:01:25,426 --> 00:01:26,176
Yes.

77
00:05:07,092 --> 00:05:07,643
Yes?

121
00:06:50,509 --> 00:06:51,014
Yes.

131
00:07:12,217 --> 00:07:12,766
Yes.

325
00:17:38,509 --> 00:17:39,158
Yes.

413
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,301
Yes.

433
00:23:16,938 --> 00:23:17,980
I...

117
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:42,004
Fine.

132
00:07:13,465 --> 00:07:14,257
Sono!

191
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:44,633
Yeah.

197
00:09:58,612 --> 00:09:59,196
Yeah.

213
00:10:40,653 --> 00:10:41,344
Sure.

275
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:07,110
Sure.

320
00:17:23,534 --> 00:17:24,302
Here.

333
00:18:01,487 --> 00:18:02,095
Yeah.

368
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:39,561
Yeah.

371
00:19:47,926 --> 00:19:48,387
'Kay.

56
00:04:22,926 --> 00:04:23,509
Right.

61
00:04:31,705 --> 00:04:32,581
Hmm...

129
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:09,715
Oreki.

200
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:02,540
I see.

225
00:11:08,603 --> 00:11:09,398
Right!

244
00:12:40,558 --> 00:12:41,642
Wow...

291
00:15:49,203 --> 00:15:49,989
I see.

294
00:15:56,009 --> 00:15:56,710
Oreki.

300
00:16:41,801 --> 00:16:42,685
Oreki!

382
00:20:24,134 --> 00:20:24,964
I see.

22
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:03,421
Wait...

51
00:03:57,843 --> 00:03:58,743
Thanks.

75
00:05:04,592 --> 00:05:05,338
Gotcha.

211
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,451
Thanks.

259
00:14:23,481 --> 00:14:24,523
Hotaro!

96
00:05:44,717 --> 00:05:45,968
Oh. Yes.

400
00:21:09,722 --> 00:21:10,355
You did?

84
00:05:23,009 --> 00:05:23,929
Nakatake!

113
00:06:37,884 --> 00:06:38,551
The kids?

126
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:01,634
Tanimoto!

133
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:15,167
Yes, sir?

135
00:07:18,301 --> 00:07:18,965
Yes, sir.

136
00:07:19,169 --> 00:07:20,086
Tanimoto.

137
00:07:20,177 --> 00:07:20,886
Yes, sir?

140
00:07:25,301 --> 00:07:25,954
Yes, sir.

142
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:29,434
Yes, sir.

245
00:13:01,534 --> 00:13:02,826
Aw, crap.

365
00:19:29,996 --> 00:19:30,825
Could be.

398
00:21:07,117 --> 00:21:07,742
Oh, yeah?

3
00:00:16,889 --> 00:00:17,931
It's fine.

7
00:00:23,038 --> 00:00:24,113
Fantastic!

13
00:00:38,134 --> 00:00:39,066
Oh. Sorry.

57
00:04:23,592 --> 00:04:24,254
'Scuse me.

76
00:05:05,852 --> 00:05:06,975
So, Oreki.

93
00:05:39,905 --> 00:05:40,988
Uh... yes?

102
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:04,440
Sincerely.

155
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:08,516
From whom?

184
00:09:18,926 --> 00:09:19,901
Excuse me.

189
00:09:30,475 --> 00:09:31,558
Who knows?

207
00:10:26,429 --> 00:10:27,363
Yes, I am.

299
00:16:38,261 --> 00:16:39,249
Oh, Oreki.

352
00:18:53,014 --> 00:18:54,170
Um, Oreki?

53
00:04:17,755 --> 00:04:18,922
Hey, Hanai.

138
00:07:21,009 --> 00:07:22,204
Call Murai.

199
00:10:00,977 --> 00:10:01,769
Yes, it is.

209
00:10:32,645 --> 00:10:33,486
That's all.

228
00:11:18,217 --> 00:11:18,933
Hey, Hanai,

246
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:07,983
Not good...

305
00:16:50,021 --> 00:16:50,863
I couldn't.

355
00:19:00,128 --> 00:19:01,067
And he's...

366
00:19:33,896 --> 00:19:35,076
Hey, Oreki.

52
00:04:13,948 --> 00:04:15,252
Anyone here?

58
00:04:26,815 --> 00:04:27,815
Who are you?

74
00:05:03,767 --> 00:05:04,517
In the hall.

94
00:05:41,103 --> 00:05:42,044
Who are you?

236
00:11:35,878 --> 00:11:36,545
That's true.

278
00:15:11,697 --> 00:15:12,526
That's good.

289
00:15:44,169 --> 00:15:45,928
Huh... Uh...

390
00:20:46,315 --> 00:20:47,315
Interesting.

404
00:21:20,551 --> 00:21:21,390
It suits me.

426
00:22:32,922 --> 00:22:33,959
But still...

11
00:00:35,634 --> 00:00:36,403
That's right.

182
00:09:15,578 --> 00:09:16,794
I don't know.

267
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:45,801
Man, shut up.

314
00:17:05,286 --> 00:17:05,927
That's right!

419
00:22:07,105 --> 00:22:08,081
Good for you.

428
00:22:48,622 --> 00:22:49,651
By the way...

81
00:05:15,176 --> 00:05:16,134
The newspaper.

109
00:06:24,362 --> 00:06:25,636
Oreki, was it?

241
00:12:00,104 --> 00:12:01,223
It's freezing.

264
00:14:37,405 --> 00:14:38,215
Main building.

336
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,207
Did he really?

72
00:05:00,108 --> 00:05:00,939
Will that work?

112
00:06:37,001 --> 00:06:37,793
Got it covered.

114
00:06:38,634 --> 00:06:39,384
Got it covered.

239
00:11:41,411 --> 00:11:42,544
Kinda sad, huh?

272
00:15:00,384 --> 00:15:01,350
Yeah, for what?

406
00:21:25,342 --> 00:21:27,031
You have? Good.

1
00:00:11,582 --> 00:00:12,957
Oreki residence.

16
00:00:47,374 --> 00:00:48,541
Dolls' Festival?

18
00:00:50,092 --> 00:00:51,546
Ah, yes, I know.

34
00:01:26,259 --> 00:01:27,117
Are the dolls...

90
00:05:34,953 --> 00:05:35,704
Right away, sir.

232
00:11:27,467 --> 00:11:29,149
Oh. I guess not.

240
00:11:42,676 --> 00:11:43,552
That's for sure.

281
00:15:18,411 --> 00:15:19,995
Mm-hmm. I heard.

308
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,383
Oh, okay, right.

418
00:22:05,854 --> 00:22:06,843
That's for sure.

432
00:23:13,465 --> 00:23:15,176
Oh. Uh, nothing.

97
00:05:46,084 --> 00:05:47,191
My name is Oreki.

115
00:06:39,467 --> 00:06:40,301
The living dolls?

124
00:06:58,346 --> 00:06:59,506
What did you say?

247
00:13:08,792 --> 00:13:10,584
This is not good!

283
00:15:29,588 --> 00:15:31,166
Oh. Hello, Oreki.

312
00:17:03,044 --> 00:17:04,036
What I mean is...

321
00:17:28,394 --> 00:17:29,655
Okay, good to go?

354
00:18:58,878 --> 00:19:00,044
Well, I know him.

358
00:19:07,578 --> 00:19:08,702
That makes sense.

360
00:19:12,288 --> 00:19:13,215
What do you mean?

385
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:32,218
It's fascinating.

31
00:01:21,621 --> 00:01:23,097
Yes, that's right.

46
00:03:50,301 --> 00:03:51,467
Excuse me, mister.

48
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:54,382
Yeah, you're fine.

153
00:08:02,092 --> 00:08:03,218
Then why did they?

171
00:08:41,176 --> 00:08:42,676
No dolls for them?

206
00:10:24,898 --> 00:10:26,010
Are you listening?

242
00:12:06,467 --> 00:12:07,436
Oh, isn't that...?

277
00:15:09,515 --> 00:15:11,161
Well, not too bad.

288
00:15:42,013 --> 00:15:42,988
What do you think?

317
00:17:11,717 --> 00:17:13,163
Oh, good, so do I.

328
00:17:47,506 --> 00:17:48,923
Yes, I believe so.

363
00:19:21,715 --> 00:19:22,995
Ah, so that's why.

395
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:00,017
I love this place.

10
00:00:33,588 --> 00:00:35,514
Your what? Parasol?

188
00:09:29,116 --> 00:09:30,174
What does she want?

190
00:09:42,328 --> 00:09:43,703
Oreki, is that you?

301
00:16:42,772 --> 00:16:43,894
What? What's wrong?

322
00:17:29,947 --> 00:17:31,635
Ready, set, reveal!

91
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,492
For crying out loud.

116
00:06:40,384 --> 00:06:41,384
They need more time.

221
00:11:00,301 --> 00:11:01,334
All right, everyone,

285
00:15:33,097 --> 00:15:34,589
That's a long story.

345
00:18:31,282 --> 00:18:32,782
Oh, the cherry tree!

88
00:05:31,868 --> 00:05:33,817
1:00 is way too late!

89
00:05:33,842 --> 00:05:34,893
Have them move it up!

243
00:12:07,715 --> 00:12:09,153
I think that's Irisu.

252
00:14:06,618 --> 00:14:08,118
I can't see Chitanda.

302
00:16:43,977 --> 00:16:45,394
Today was just awful!

26
00:01:11,566 --> 00:01:13,079
All right. I'll do it.

32
00:01:23,323 --> 00:01:25,198
So the dolls can walk?

79
00:05:11,801 --> 00:05:13,006
As far as I know, yes.

83
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:22,894
I can't relax in here.

103
00:06:04,748 --> 00:06:05,998
It's my pleasure, sir.

159
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,519
Never mind the reason.

216
00:10:47,457 --> 00:10:48,566
Please tell them that.

282
00:15:26,956 --> 00:15:29,251
Oh. Hey, there, Irisu.

293
00:15:54,535 --> 00:15:55,910
Don't do that, please.

399
00:21:07,842 --> 00:21:09,314
Well, I chose science.

17
00:00:48,624 --> 00:00:50,041
But it's already April.

162
00:08:23,788 --> 00:08:24,876
It's too late for that.

198
00:09:59,314 --> 00:10:00,815
Is it anything serious?

219
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,320
That's all she told me.

258
00:14:21,328 --> 00:14:22,483
What would happen then?

384
00:20:27,947 --> 00:20:29,363
I wouldn't go that far.

407
00:21:27,346 --> 00:21:29,080
I see two ways, really.

437
00:23:30,562 --> 00:23:32,831
No. It's spring, silly.

82
00:05:16,217 --> 00:05:18,225
Geez, for the love of...

205
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:22,657
But not everyone agrees.

238
00:11:38,801 --> 00:11:40,194
Well, what do you think?

260
00:14:27,595 --> 00:14:29,578
Man, that was fantastic!

342
00:18:24,137 --> 00:18:25,349
Do you know what it was?

351
00:18:51,249 --> 00:18:52,821
I wouldn't call it that.

4
00:00:18,094 --> 00:00:19,636
I know it's short notice,

54
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,576
Where should I put these?

237
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,349
And, the finishing touch.

254
00:14:12,235 --> 00:14:14,568
I just... I have to know.

141
00:07:26,489 --> 00:07:28,448
Will that cover it, Hanai?

223
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,093
What are you waiting for?!

253
00:14:09,749 --> 00:14:11,471
I can't see how she looks.

273
00:15:01,778 --> 00:15:03,320
For the Valentine's thing.

276
00:15:07,757 --> 00:15:09,214
How's it been going since?

350
00:18:46,322 --> 00:18:47,983
That's a frivolous motive.

12
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,051
I'm not sure what you mean.

68
00:04:51,761 --> 00:04:54,113
Hey, Nakatake, are we good?

71
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,025
I delegated it to the maid.

157
00:08:09,938 --> 00:08:11,519
I didn't think it mattered.

186
00:09:23,447 --> 00:09:24,929
Yes. That's me. What is it?

194
00:09:49,861 --> 00:09:51,973
That is Chitanda, isn't it?

249
00:13:21,032 --> 00:13:22,917
What is the matter with me?

257
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:20,995
Looking down so demurely...

313
00:17:04,092 --> 00:17:05,259
You just have to know, huh?

377
00:20:08,237 --> 00:20:10,355
Ah, so that was a big deal.

391
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:48,753
You may have a point there.

69
00:04:54,356 --> 00:04:55,980
We're good. It's on the way.

130
00:07:10,384 --> 00:07:12,134
Are you positive about this?

147
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:39,856
What's he glaring at me for?

149
00:07:51,523 --> 00:07:53,731
Tanimoto! This falls on you!

256
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,804
Dressed up so beautifully...

304
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:49,917
Yeah, you're a real trooper.

42
00:01:49,528 --> 00:01:51,339
Head upstream along the brook

156
00:08:08,565 --> 00:08:09,884
Well, I didn't ask them that.

183
00:09:17,196 --> 00:09:18,779
I'm not sure about it either.

217
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:51,692
So is that the whole message?

271
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,316
Oreki, I wanted to thank you.

284
00:15:31,462 --> 00:15:32,818
Weren't you the emperor doll?

309
00:16:56,547 --> 00:16:58,214
I've been obsessing about it,

80
00:05:13,092 --> 00:05:15,092
Hanai, sir! Telephone for you.

85
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:26,092
What's going on with the saké?

127
00:07:01,717 --> 00:07:03,361
You did follow up, didn't you?

397
00:21:04,985 --> 00:21:06,604
Oh, I chose lit. Seemed right.

421
00:22:16,801 --> 00:22:18,673
I know this is where I belong.

59
00:04:28,009 --> 00:04:29,842
Hello, my name is Hotaro Oreki.

99
00:05:55,926 --> 00:05:57,592
We're shorthanded, but still...

234
00:11:31,834 --> 00:11:33,543
I came back home just for this.

268
00:14:45,884 --> 00:14:47,771
For real, it was wasted on you.

269
00:14:48,136 --> 00:14:49,876
Fine, keep running your mouths.

338
00:18:13,921 --> 00:18:15,459
They do this every year, right?

412
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:48,267
Which is why you chose science?

436
00:23:25,297 --> 00:23:27,119
It's starting to get cold, huh?

50
00:03:56,568 --> 00:03:57,818
You won't be able to cross back.

192
00:09:45,217 --> 00:09:47,095
Sorry I can't come out and talk.

220
00:10:58,238 --> 00:11:00,154
Okay, then that's what we'll do.

226
00:11:13,546 --> 00:11:15,717
Yes, Toji bridge. Did I stutter?

251
00:13:29,772 --> 00:13:32,105
has encountered a deadly threat.

380
00:20:16,572 --> 00:20:18,148
And that's where you stepped in.

392
00:20:49,286 --> 00:20:51,302
If I manage to get into college,

420
00:22:14,515 --> 00:22:16,424
Just look at all of this, Oreki.

47
00:03:51,511 --> 00:03:53,219
Is it okay if I ride across here?

73
00:05:01,485 --> 00:05:03,607
Hey. Where are the spare banners?

166
00:08:32,621 --> 00:08:34,044
What if they took the same route,

224
00:11:06,509 --> 00:11:07,842
Start getting things ready to go!

248
00:13:17,275 --> 00:13:19,358
I'm rethinking this entire thing.

334
00:18:02,397 --> 00:18:04,065
He helped me get into my costume.

30
00:01:19,987 --> 00:01:21,493
Walk with all the dolls, you mean?

107
00:06:20,235 --> 00:06:21,902
You sure are a stalwart young man.

128
00:07:03,676 --> 00:07:06,260
Well... I reminded Murai about it.

178
00:08:58,743 --> 00:09:00,850
So then what do you propose we do?

203
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:14,562
There's an issue at Chokyu bridge.

218
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:53,405
Don't worry, they will understand.

324
00:17:36,624 --> 00:17:38,158
We're thinking of the same person?

23
00:01:03,553 --> 00:01:05,092
You mean someone holds it for them?

37
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:35,975
They're not really dolls, are they?

101
00:06:01,504 --> 00:06:03,463
We appreciate your help, young man.

306
00:16:50,944 --> 00:16:52,842
Not that, silly, the Chokyu bridge!

337
00:18:11,756 --> 00:18:13,727
Yeah, and I thought that was weird.

64
00:04:39,828 --> 00:04:42,495
Oh, you came to take Hazawa's place?

119
00:06:45,092 --> 00:06:46,889
Murai is in charge of that now, sir.

176
00:08:53,693 --> 00:08:55,494
then crossing over to the west side?

202
00:10:05,451 --> 00:10:07,483
There's not much time, so talk fast.

250
00:13:26,617 --> 00:13:29,451
My philosophy of energy conservation

255
00:14:15,212 --> 00:14:16,792
If I could see her from the front...

262
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:35,052
They were so gorgeous, weren't they?

279
00:15:13,781 --> 00:15:15,467
I snapped at him for that, you know.

9
00:00:30,972 --> 00:00:33,402
You'd be willing to carry my parasol.

19
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:53,558
This shrine goes by the old calendar.

39
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,290
The dolls are just girls in costumes.

49
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:56,455
We're about to start working, though.

143
00:07:29,598 --> 00:07:31,189
What's the problem with construction?

326
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:41,377
I'm curious: why did you suspect him?

431
00:23:11,174 --> 00:23:13,359
By the way what? Finish that thought.

434
00:23:20,027 --> 00:23:21,978
I wonder if this is how Satoshi felt.

60
00:04:29,926 --> 00:04:31,597
I'm supposed to be carrying a parasol.

108
00:06:21,993 --> 00:06:23,666
First time I've ever been called that.

160
00:08:18,634 --> 00:08:20,663
We have to deal with this immediately.

168
00:08:36,189 --> 00:08:37,509
They could just stay on the east bank.

343
00:18:25,924 --> 00:18:28,044
Well, for one, they altered the route.

344
00:18:28,302 --> 00:18:30,537
Doing that took us to the Toji bridge.

435
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:24,315
Afraid to spoil it by saying too much.

65
00:04:42,593 --> 00:04:44,551
I'm sorry about that. Come right on in.

67
00:04:49,102 --> 00:04:51,658
I gave it to Nakatake 'cause it rhymed.

122
00:06:51,093 --> 00:06:52,690
He assured me he would take care of it.

193
00:09:47,632 --> 00:09:49,447
I'm not quite finished getting dressed.

201
00:10:03,511 --> 00:10:05,312
Can you fill me in as much as possible?

319
00:17:17,427 --> 00:17:19,399
That's fine with me, but write on what?

346
00:18:32,937 --> 00:18:35,002
Yes, and it was blooming out of season.

379
00:20:14,076 --> 00:20:16,018
what channels to use to make that call.

55
00:04:20,887 --> 00:04:22,842
Oh, over in the hall, if you don't mind.

66
00:04:45,764 --> 00:04:48,656
Hey, Hanai, who's in charge of the saké?

86
00:05:26,176 --> 00:05:27,884
They told me that it'll be here at 1:00.

148
00:07:47,551 --> 00:07:49,956
It's true! They've resumed construction!

290
00:15:46,404 --> 00:15:48,757
I guess it does, sure, but I don't know.

307
00:16:52,926 --> 00:16:54,985
The business with Nakagawa Construction!

316
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,639
Well, yeah, I do have a suspect in mind.

332
00:17:58,927 --> 00:18:00,975
And you're saying that was Konari's son?

387
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:37,813
of a little community north of Kamiyama.

410
00:21:38,743 --> 00:21:40,799
with the goal of wasting nothing at all.

28
00:01:15,895 --> 00:01:17,711
I just have to stand next to them, right?

164
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,514
Plus, if someone gets hurt, we're liable.

340
00:18:18,649 --> 00:18:20,756
You're right, that's an odd thing to say.

341
00:18:21,161 --> 00:18:23,635
However, a "rare sight" did happen today.

401
00:21:10,989 --> 00:21:13,156
I'm not depressed about coming back here.

14
00:00:39,138 --> 00:00:41,394
I didn't explain that very clearly, did I?

29
00:01:17,842 --> 00:01:19,929
Well, no, you have to walk alongside them.

62
00:04:34,933 --> 00:04:37,007
I guess Chitanda didn't tell you about me?

110
00:06:26,418 --> 00:06:29,001
You just relax here until we send for you.

118
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:45,006
Tanimoto, is the Chokyu bridge good to go?

231
00:11:23,467 --> 00:11:25,453
Yeah, but I couldn't fit into the costume.

393
00:20:51,384 --> 00:20:53,845
I'm still gonna come back here eventually.

111
00:06:34,842 --> 00:06:36,926
What about the parishioner representatives?

185
00:09:20,113 --> 00:09:22,260
Is there someone here by the name of Oreki?

222
00:11:01,359 --> 00:11:04,203
we'll take a detour across the Toji bridge.

263
00:14:35,271 --> 00:14:37,141
Where are Chitanda and the other dolls now?

296
00:16:00,695 --> 00:16:02,924
And in this one, I'm just the emperor doll.

311
00:17:00,676 --> 00:17:02,605
I was dying to ask about it the whole time.

36
00:01:30,661 --> 00:01:32,933
This is embarrassing enough for me as it is.

210
00:10:33,972 --> 00:10:36,442
I must say, that was an excellent retelling.

235
00:11:33,587 --> 00:11:35,599
If I'm in the parade, I can't see it, right?

349
00:18:42,342 --> 00:18:44,472
That is what I'd call a "rare sight to see."

357
00:19:05,201 --> 00:19:07,430
without thinking twice about their feelings.

416
00:21:58,451 --> 00:22:00,764
when I saw how I was driving everyone crazy.

144
00:07:31,862 --> 00:07:34,528
The procession is set to cross Chokyu bridge.

158
00:08:11,617 --> 00:08:13,991
The workers told me a similar story just now.

169
00:08:37,592 --> 00:08:39,134
That's great for the people on the east side,

187
00:09:25,249 --> 00:09:27,496
Chitanda's daughter asked me to come get you.

195
00:09:53,588 --> 00:09:55,526
I called you back here to find out what's up.

270
00:14:50,722 --> 00:14:52,931
I'm gonna go get another one of these things.

274
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:05,791
I haven't had a chance to tell you until now.

87
00:05:27,967 --> 00:05:31,707
Are you a moron?! The parade is over at 12:30!

95
00:05:42,155 --> 00:05:44,634
Oh, you must be that kid Chitanda recommended.

196
00:09:55,823 --> 00:09:58,060
Something has gone kind of haywire, hasn't it?

63
00:04:37,153 --> 00:04:39,691
I was asked to be a replacement parasol-bearer.

167
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:36,110
but doubled back instead of crossing the river?

212
00:10:37,634 --> 00:10:40,264
Oreki, can I ask you to relay a message for me?

280
00:15:15,743 --> 00:15:18,201
It's not very often that I really lay into him.

303
00:16:45,509 --> 00:16:47,803
I've been forced to hold it in this whole time!

329
00:17:49,086 --> 00:17:51,669
Okay, then who would have made that phone call?

430
00:22:55,628 --> 00:22:58,044
What if I were to take on that task for myself?

27
00:01:13,151 --> 00:01:15,486
You mean it?! I can't thank you enough for this!

43
00:01:52,086 --> 00:01:54,732
and take the Chokyu bridge past the cherry tree.

163
00:08:24,901 --> 00:08:27,466
The TV crew is already here and set up to shoot.

287
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:41,320
A lot of it sounds a bit suspect, if you ask me.

376
00:20:05,134 --> 00:20:07,702
would be a major source of contention, even now.

38
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:39,081
No. It's Mizunashi Shrine's Living Doll Festival.

104
00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:08,070
I'm sorry that a stranger like me has to intrude.

172
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:44,051
Then what if they go down to the bridge and back,

179
00:09:00,961 --> 00:09:03,867
We could have them cross over at the Toji bridge.

233
00:11:29,223 --> 00:11:31,763
Besides, this kind of procession is a rare sight.

265
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:41,153
They said something about purging their impurity.

295
00:15:57,729 --> 00:16:00,332
In that situation, I had a specific role to play.

422
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:21,714
There's nothing here but the water and the earth.

146
00:07:35,441 --> 00:07:38,031
I really hope you're mistaken about this one, kid.

150
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:56,533
No, there has to be some kind of misunderstanding!

170
00:08:39,209 --> 00:08:41,084
but what about all the folks gathered on the west?

173
00:08:44,118 --> 00:08:46,994
then cross over here and then go up the west side?

310
00:16:58,384 --> 00:17:00,492
but since I had a part to play, I couldn't let on.

330
00:17:51,745 --> 00:17:54,120
Everyone was running around like crazy here today.

383
00:20:25,149 --> 00:20:27,649
No wonder Satoshi calls your family "prestigious."

427
00:22:36,882 --> 00:22:39,322
I just felt compelled to share it with you, Oreki.

44
00:03:30,768 --> 00:03:35,140
Wow. That cherry tree. It's blooming out of season.

389
00:20:42,315 --> 00:20:44,859
but I wouldn't dismiss it as insignificant, either.

45
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:49,465
Did Chitanda really not know there was construction?

105
00:06:08,132 --> 00:06:10,549
I'll try my very best to keep out of everyone's way.

177
00:08:55,588 --> 00:08:58,656
I refuse to do something that ridiculous on live TV.

425
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:31,847
And I don't even believe it has very much potential.

5
00:00:19,759 --> 00:00:22,097
but do you have any plans for the day after tomorrow?

139
00:07:22,356 --> 00:07:25,192
Scratch that, get Nakagawa Construction on the phone.

152
00:07:59,649 --> 00:08:02,009
He specifically told them not to start working today.

175
00:08:51,026 --> 00:08:53,609
Then what about going halfway to the bridge and back,

369
00:19:39,656 --> 00:19:42,008
That was what finally calmed all the chaos, you know.

374
00:19:56,588 --> 00:19:59,320
There were lots of disputes over water and territory.

388
00:20:39,124 --> 00:20:41,714
I don't think it's something grandiose or monumental,

402
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:16,218
It's actually quite the contrary, as a matter of fact.

25
00:01:06,422 --> 00:01:08,914
It would mean the world to me if you could help us out.

123
00:06:54,294 --> 00:06:57,068
Actually, they resumed construction a little while ago.

134
00:07:15,317 --> 00:07:18,217
I hate to do this, but take the truck and go make sure.

229
00:11:18,961 --> 00:11:20,525
the cameraman wants to know where he should shoot from.

261
00:14:29,696 --> 00:14:33,043
Chitanda and Irisu's elegance was absolutely unmatched!

286
00:15:34,761 --> 00:15:37,586
And speaking of those, I heard about the Chokyu bridge.

361
00:19:13,549 --> 00:19:16,616
Apparently, his lifelong dream is to be a photographer.

70
00:04:56,144 --> 00:04:58,769
Never mind that. What about the business this afternoon?

98
00:05:52,884 --> 00:05:55,780
Thanks a lot for coming all the way here to help us out.

230
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:23,384
So, um, weren't you originally slated to take over here?

370
00:19:43,555 --> 00:19:46,410
It may seem kind of trivial, but hear me out, would you?

423
00:22:21,884 --> 00:22:24,830
The people who live here will slowly grow old and tired.

227
00:11:15,817 --> 00:11:18,150
We already talked with Takahashi in the traffic division!

165
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:32,592
We'd better find a way to reroute and avoid it altogether.

373
00:19:53,717 --> 00:19:56,388
The north half was our village, and the south was another.

100
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,890
Shame we had to bother an
outsider to carry a damn parasol.

106
00:06:10,647 --> 00:06:13,426
If I do anything to offend,
please let me know immediately.

120
00:06:47,842 --> 00:06:50,403
Well, do you know if they've
halted construction, at least?

204
00:10:16,403 --> 00:10:19,393
So it's been proposed that we
cross at Toji bridge instead.

323
00:17:33,307 --> 00:17:36,491
Oh, Konari's son does have
brown hair, as a matter of fact.

180
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:09,303
If they cross at the Toji
bridge, then back via Kaya bridge,

424
00:22:25,193 --> 00:22:28,255
It's not the most beautiful
place in the world by any means.

347
00:18:35,265 --> 00:18:38,070
We'd only get to see it by
taking the route we ended up with.

359
00:19:08,912 --> 00:19:11,951
But couple that with your
theory, and I am totally convinced.

2
00:00:13,176 --> 00:00:16,329
Good morning. It's Chitanda.
Sorry to bother you on a day off.

181
00:09:09,359 --> 00:09:12,339
it only ends up being slightly
longer than the original route.

297
00:16:03,669 --> 00:16:06,688
And since I have no stake in
any of this, I won't mislead you.

364
00:19:23,671 --> 00:19:27,171
I'm sure he just wanted to get
a photo of such a "rare sight."

415
00:21:55,931 --> 00:21:58,426
That was a lesson that I learned
during the cultural festival,

151
00:07:56,592 --> 00:07:59,551
I'm positive that Murai called
the construction office earlier!

339
00:18:15,676 --> 00:18:18,368
If he's from here, why would
this procession be so rare to him?

362
00:19:16,802 --> 00:19:19,737
He is going to vocational school
to study it, as far as I know.

214
00:10:41,655 --> 00:10:44,418
I will speak to the other shrine's
priest about this right away.

386
00:20:32,395 --> 00:20:35,509
All I did was act as a liaison
between the north and south sides

405
00:21:21,566 --> 00:21:24,687
I've given a lot of thought to
how I might best be able to do it.

411
00:21:42,836 --> 00:21:46,315
Ultimately, I think the former is
the more appropriate path for me.

266
00:14:41,384 --> 00:14:44,752
By the way, buddy, that outfit
did not suit you at all, just saying.

174
00:08:47,169 --> 00:08:50,648
Walking twice the length of the
current route is out of the question.

35
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:30,620
Oreki, please! I'd appreciate it
if you'd stop saying "dolls" so much.

215
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:47,342
I am also going to have my father
call the parishioner representative.

315
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:08,747
You must have drawn up some conclusion
about everything that happened.

396
00:21:00,854 --> 00:21:04,856
So, Oreki... What did you choose
for your second year? Science or lit?

353
00:18:55,215 --> 00:18:58,423
But who knows what he was really
thinking. Why did you suspect him too?

348
00:18:38,404 --> 00:18:42,259
The spectacle of a parade of living
dolls passing under cherry blossoms?

372
00:19:49,586 --> 00:19:53,560
A long time ago, this area was
divided into two halves: north and south.

394
00:20:54,065 --> 00:20:58,151
No matter where life takes me, in
the end, my place will always be here.

417
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:04,715
I don't think I have the skillset
needed to manage a bunch of employees.

41
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,477
I've been participating as one of
the living dolls for the past few years.

161
00:08:20,761 --> 00:08:23,763
There's gotta be a way to get them
to halt construction before the parade.

429
00:22:51,555 --> 00:22:55,418
As far as the managerial perspective
that you determined wasn't for you...

292
00:15:50,107 --> 00:15:53,461
I thought you'd be the first person
to try his hand at solving the mystery.

78
00:05:08,095 --> 00:05:11,717
You're going to be carrying a parasol
for Chitanda's daughter, is that right?

414
00:21:50,457 --> 00:21:54,282
Yeah, I definitely don't think you're
cut out for the latter path, no offense.

21
00:00:58,051 --> 00:01:01,653
They can't find anyone who fits into his
costume, but you guys are the same size.

318
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:17,382
Why don't we write it down and reveal
our theories to each other at the same time?

367
00:19:35,176 --> 00:19:38,871
Remember in my dressing room when I
mentioned contacting the other shrine's priest?

378
00:20:10,695 --> 00:20:14,051
They wanted to let them know ahead of time,
but there aren't many people who even know

381
00:20:19,273 --> 00:20:23,480
Once I talked to the other side, we were
free to go that far south with peace of mind.

403
00:21:16,384 --> 00:21:20,438
As the daughter of the Chitanda family, I
want to fulfill the role I was born to play.

208
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:32,463
When the others heard that, for some odd
reason they started acting weird and scowling.

20
00:00:53,717 --> 00:00:57,942
I'm only asking because one of the parasol
holders had a freak accident and can't do it.

327
00:17:43,009 --> 00:17:47,017
First of all, it seems pretty clear that they
got a call saying to come to work today, right?

408
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:34,356
One of those is to help us all prosper by
developing a commodity that's extremely marketable.

356
00:19:01,342 --> 00:19:05,176
Konari's son is the only person around here who
would put so many people through all that stress

375
00:20:00,528 --> 00:20:05,109
And though that was so long ago, for a solemn
ritual like this, crossing over without permission

331
00:17:54,259 --> 00:17:58,790
There was only one person who seemed totally
sure we wouldn't be able to cross the Chokyu bridge.

409
00:21:34,554 --> 00:21:38,718
The other way would be to make our production
more efficient, working from a managerial standpoint,

154
00:08:03,297 --> 00:08:07,676
I do know they got a call the day before yesterday
to go ahead as planned, though, so maybe that's why.

15
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:47,145
Let me try again. The shrine near my house is hosting a
Dolls' Festival the day after tomorrow and we need help.

335
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:10,024
He told me that he came back home just for this, and he
said that this kind of procession is a rare sight to see.

8
00:00:24,322 --> 00:00:30,740
Listen, I know it's kind of rude to ask you this out of
the blue, so no pressure, but I was wondering, well, if...
