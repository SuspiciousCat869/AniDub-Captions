1
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:52,583
Hey! Let me outta here!

2
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:07,541
Man, this sucks...

3
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:09,916
It's been a week already.

4
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,416
What do they want with me?

5
00:01:16,625 --> 00:01:17,875
I guess this is it.

6
00:01:20,708 --> 00:01:22,791
Seems weird they
don't have a sign...

7
00:01:24,208 --> 00:01:25,916
It makes sense.

8
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,375
I'm here on Margery's
recommendation

9
00:01:27,458 --> 00:01:29,208
so I can't screw up.

10
00:01:47,791 --> 00:01:49,708
I think this is
the right place....

11
00:01:53,833 --> 00:01:55,416
Uh... Hello...

12
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,166
I'm here as the representative
of the Chanter of eleg...

13
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,708
You must be Keisaku Sato.

14
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,583
Please... if
you'll follow me.

15
00:02:07,666 --> 00:02:09,291
Sure.

16
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:10,833
For security reasons...

17
00:02:10,916 --> 00:02:13,000
I'll need to hold on
to your cell phone...

18
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:15,583
and any other communication
device you may have.

19
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:34,291
This is different
than I expected.

20
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:48,833
So, uh...

21
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:57,250
Hey!

22
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:58,625
What's goin' on...?!

23
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:00,833
C'mon, man...! Let me out!

24
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:08,000
[Music]

25
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:36,000
I can't believe I walked
right into a trap.

26
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:39,458
Why did I ever come here?!

27
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:43,250
I hope everyone
back home's okay.

28
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:01,166
I can't believe that
I completely froze

29
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:02,791
in front of Yuji.

30
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:07,125
That time we had alone
might've been my only chance

31
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:11,125
to turn things around.

32
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:13,583
Maybe I could've undone some
of their brainwashing...

33
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:20,250
No... it wouldn't
have worked,

34
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:22,083
he's too far gone.

35
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:27,250
I was so scared when he
reached out to touch me...

36
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:29,500
like he might take
something from me.

37
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,041
I don't understand why...

38
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:44,375
You're such an idiot!

39
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:46,250
There's no need to
get all worked up.

40
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:47,708
Are you kiddin' me?!

41
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:49,041
You typed a letter
to Wilhelmina

42
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:51,375
and forged my
signature on it!

43
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:53,833
Of course I'm worked up!

44
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:55,875
This is exactly why
I've always preferred

45
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:57,916
handwritten letters!

46
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,541
I'm sorry but it
had to be done...

47
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:03,500
The situation in Misaki City's
gotten out of hand...

48
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:06,291
We need her help
now more than ever.

49
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:07,791
What's goin' on?

50
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:09,541
I was merely trying
to get her to speak

51
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:11,708
with Commander Sawallisch...

52
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:12,958
That's all it would
take to convince her...

53
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:15,250
Shut up!

54
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:18,125
I don't understand
why you're so angry.

55
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:20,625
Flieder's just trying to do
what's best for everyone!

56
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:22,958
I hate to break it
to you, Brigid,

57
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:26,625
but what your Flame Haze pulled
was totally out of line.

58
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:28,250
I would've contacted
her myself

59
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:30,541
but she won't listen to me.

60
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:32,250
Now that Margery
Daw's down...

61
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:34,625
she's basically
on her own.

62
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:36,416
I didn't have a choice.

63
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:39,916
Tell me what's happened
to Margery Daw...!

64
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,125
I need to know!

65
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:42,541
Please tell me!

66
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:45,208
Lemme guess, you're
the boy she sent...?

67
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:47,541
Okay fine, I'm comin' in.

68
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:50,000
Stand back! Get
away from the door!

69
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:50,875
Hurry!

70
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:55,250
Stop being reckless!

71
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:58,000
He's no good to us as
a hostage if he's dead!

72
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:00,125
I was just
testin' his luck.

73
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:02,166
There's no need to
get all worked up.

74
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,125
Hello...! You're not
missin' any limbs, are ya...?

75
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:08,500
You're alive and
in one piece,

76
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:11,416
I'd say you've
got good luck.

77
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,333
Rebecca Reed, the Scatterer
of Sparkling Light.

78
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:17,333
And this is the Opened Eye
of Incineration, Balar...

79
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:18,625
Nice to meet ya.

80
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:26,166
What?! Margery's in a coma?!

81
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,041
She would never
let that happen!

82
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:30,208
Yeah well, I don't think
she was planning on it.

83
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:32,750
But I'm afraid that's what it
said in Wilhelmina's report.

84
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:36,083
How did it happen?

85
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:38,958
You've had a bad day and
I hate to make it worse...

86
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:41,791
but something terrible
happened in Misaki City.

87
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:47,250
You ain't leavin', kid.

88
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,041
Oh yeah, who says so...?!

89
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:51,625
Listen... I have to get
back there to see her.

90
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:53,791
Considerin' the state
she's in right now,

91
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:55,833
there's nothin'
you can do to help.

92
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:57,833
When you care
for someone...

93
00:07:57,916 --> 00:07:59,708
it's only natural to
be worried about them!

94
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:02,250
Aw... you care for her?

95
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:06,208
I guess so...

96
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:07,541
I was wondering,

97
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:09,500
are you good friends
with Wilhelmina?

98
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:10,833
Why do you ask?

99
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:12,541
I overheard you say
something about a letter

100
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,625
that had been
written to her.

101
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:16,958
You heard that, huh...?

102
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:19,791
Well, I haven't talked to
Wilhelmina in a while...

103
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:22,125
but I would definitely
consider her my friend.

104
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:23,750
-Seriously?
-Uh-huh.

105
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:30,458
Hello...?

106
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,666
Yeah, I know.
I'm on my way now.

107
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:38,750
I've gotta meeting
to get to...

108
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:40,583
You stay put
while I'm gone.

109
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:44,291
Wait a minute!

110
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:51,625
Rebecca!

111
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:57,458
Good grief...

112
00:08:57,541 --> 00:09:00,291
Kids these days can
be so belligerent.

113
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:02,583
Funny you should
say that...

114
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:03,875
Rebecca...

115
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:05,375
Is somethin' wrong?

116
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:07,541
No, it's just that
I've watched you

117
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:09,500
become increasingly
irritable lately...

118
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:12,416
and I think this boy could
help you get past it.

119
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:48,958
I knew it, it's a Rinne...

120
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:50,791
Stand back, Specialist...

121
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:52,708
I can handle this
one on my own!

122
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:22,166
That was too easy.

123
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,125
Scatterer of
Sparkling Light...

124
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:30,416
I would indeed appreciate
some advance warning.

125
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:43,708
Right back atcha.

126
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:49,833
Back then, I'd have no
problem helping her out.

127
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:54,666
She's never been the
kind to ask for help...

128
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,458
She must be in
big trouble.

129
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:06,666
This is the last
response to my request...

130
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,666
I'm afraid we've run
out of viable options.

131
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,125
So disappointing.

132
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:15,583
Outlaw is preparing
to head into battle...

133
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:17,333
Indeed, it's no surprise

134
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:19,833
they want to hold their
forces in reserve...

135
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:21,208
If I must, I am prepared

136
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:23,500
to take care of this
matter by myself.

137
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:34,083
I thank you for making the
long and treacherous journey

138
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:35,416
to join us...

139
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,958
Guardian of Steady Passage,
Samuel Demantius...

140
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:41,708
and the Peaceful Shield
of Scales, Zirnitra.

141
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:44,208
I apologize for
our late arrival,

142
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:48,833
normally we would have responded
to your summons immediately.

143
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:51,291
I assure you, we will
do everything we can

144
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:54,250
to meet your
expectations of us.

145
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:57,000
We'll rely heavily on
you in the days to come.

146
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,625
True...

147
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:00,375
We're delighted to
have you here with us,

148
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:01,958
and my only regret...

149
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:04,375
is the circumstances
of your visit.

150
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:10,833
Together we will be an
unstoppable force...

151
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:13,083
Supreme Commander,
Mother Courage...

152
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:16,041
Sophie Sawallisch, the
Braider of Trembling Might...

153
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:20,000
and the Thunder Blade of
Banishment, Takemikazuchi.

154
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:22,666
We are honored to fight
alongside the Flame Haze

155
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:25,166
of Outlaw.

156
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,083
I can't thank you
enough, Sirotci...

157
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:30,166
I'm sure that your expertise
will prove indispensible.

158
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:36,500
Now that our Shanghai
post has been annihilated

159
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:39,000
our final line of defense
in the eastern theater,

160
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:40,583
the Tokyo post,

161
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:43,125
has increased
in importance.

162
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:44,625
As a result...

163
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:47,083
I suspect that when Bal
Masque makes their move...

164
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:49,791
they will attack Tokyo
and the surrounding area.

165
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:54,250
So, basically, we're
going to need to gather

166
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:56,750
as many powerful
Flame Haze as we can.

167
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:59,875
Isn't that right, Flieder?

168
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:01,875
You'll be in command
of this post...

169
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:03,833
but we're going to
ask Wilhelmina Carmel

170
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,208
to come and assist you.

171
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:06,916
Oh really...?

172
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,958
And just how are you
going to convince her...?

173
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:11,875
She wants to rescue
the captured Nietono.

174
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,916
I don't think there's
anything you could say

175
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,125
to change her mind.

176
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:16,958
And that's why I'm
going to need your help

177
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:18,041
to persuade her...

178
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:19,291
You're a smart girl,

179
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:20,625
surely you'll be
able to see...

180
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:22,916
that there's no point in
attempting such a thing.

181
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
It would be futile.

182
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:28,250
You can't just storm into
The Palace of the Stars...

183
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:30,916
Sydonay, Bel-Peol, Hecate

184
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,208
and the rest of
Bal Masque call it home.

185
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:34,875
I'm telling you,

186
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:37,208
attempting a rescue mission
there isn't just a long shot...

187
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:39,500
it's impossible.

188
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:41,625
Yeah, I can
see your point.

189
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:44,375
We can't afford to lose a
powerful Flame Haze like her

190
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:46,916
to such a hopeless cause.

191
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,541
It would be far more
logical for her to come here

192
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:52,541
and join our cause instead.

193
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:55,791
The more I have to
listen to his "logic",

194
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:58,541
the more it's startin'
to get to me...

195
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:00,208
When you care
for someone...

196
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:04,416
it's only natural to
be worried about them!

197
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,750
Oh, so that's it...!

198
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:08,541
I'm worried about her
'cause I care....

199
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:12,333
Thanks a lot for
saving me back there.

200
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:15,250
Surely, anyone else would have
indeed done the same thing.

201
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:20,750
Ya' know, at
times like this,

202
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:22,666
it's okay to say
that I owe ya one...

203
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,791
Wilhelmina.

204
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:27,333
Okay... then you owe me one...

205
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:28,666
Rebecca.

206
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:33,958
It'd be nice to repay that
favor a few hundred years later.

207
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:36,958
Are you listening?

208
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:40,208
Like it or not, I will
find a way to get her here...

209
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:42,250
You just watch me.

210
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:44,541
Are you gonna use the kid?

211
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:46,208
There's no way
she'll refuse

212
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:48,875
if she thinks her friend's
life is on the line.

213
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:51,166
Wow, just when I thought
you couldn't be

214
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,875
any more of an ass...

215
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:55,166
Um, Flieder's just
doing what's necessary

216
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:56,666
to get the job done.

217
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:59,083
There's no need
for name calling...

218
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:00,458
So, uh...

219
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:01,791
Rebecca?

220
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,250
Damn it...

221
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:08,666
Guess I'm stuck here.

222
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:13,458
Rebecca!

223
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:15,416
That was dangerous!

224
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,458
What do you think
you're doing?!

225
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,166
I'm ditchin' this place...

226
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,166
c'mon you can handle
things without me.

227
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:26,041
No, you're not
going anywhere...!

228
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,375
This is going to be the
greatest battle in history

229
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:29,416
and you're an
important part of...

230
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,583
You better get outta
my way, Flieder.

231
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:34,750
If you don't, I'll blow up this
building so spectacularly

232
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,708
the whole city
will be in awe.

233
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:40,791
Wait, is that...?

234
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:54,416
Yo... How you doin', buddy?

235
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,416
Let go- you're choking me!

236
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,291
We're bustin' outta here.

237
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:03,125
Seriously?

238
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:05,791
I started feelin' kinda guilty
about the whole thing...

239
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:08,333
so I decided I'm gonna help
my friend, Wilhelmina.

240
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:11,583
Wait, you're from Misaki
City, too, aren't ya...?

241
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:13,291
I can take ya back with me!

242
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:19,166
I'm really grateful I
bumped into you, Soto.

243
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,083
Um, it's Sato.

244
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:24,041
I've been so wrapped up in
my position with Outlaw...

245
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:26,208
I never would've left
to help Wilhelmina out

246
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:27,250
if it wasn't for you.

247
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:28,666
Oh...

248
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,208
You ended up bein' a lot
more useful than a hostage

249
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:32,416
could ever be.

250
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:38,208
Let me get this straight,

251
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:41,458
our hotheaded, little
friend left the Tokyo post

252
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:43,208
to go to Wilhelmina's aid?

253
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:45,500
Yes, ma'am.
I'm sorry, Commander.

254
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:47,375
Flieder did his
best to stop her

255
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:50,500
but she threatened to
blow up the building...

256
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:54,333
Did any other Flame Haze
leave along with Rebecca Reed?

257
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:56,083
Not that I know of...

258
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:58,666
I believe she was
the only one who left

259
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,708
but she took the
hostage with her.

260
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:02,666
Well, then it
can't be helped...

261
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:05,791
As long as it doesn't
cause problems with morale...

262
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:07,958
I suppose we'll just
have to let her go.

263
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:11,500
Here ya go...

264
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:12,916
A parting gift.

265
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:19,916
What is all this?

266
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,458
Reports I've received
from Wilhelmina.

267
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,166
They'll fill you in on
what's been happening

268
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,833
in Misaki City.

269
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:28,166
We've also included
some of Outlaw's plans

270
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,041
for the upcoming war.

271
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:31,583
So guard it with your life.

272
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:32,875
Right, I will!

273
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:34,416
If you know what's
good for ya,

274
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,041
you'll go check on Margery.

275
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:39,291
You mean, you're
not comin' with me?

276
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:41,125
Now listen up, you...

277
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:43,375
Your lady wouldn't
be too happy

278
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:46,750
if you showed up with
another chick on your arm.

279
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:48,750
No, it's not like that...

280
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:52,291
I'm just messin'
with ya, buddy!

281
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:53,750
I don't think I'd
have as much fun

282
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:55,833
watching you make
out with Margery...

283
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:57,125
as I'm gonna have teasin'

284
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:59,041
the Flaming-Haired
Blazing-Eyed Hunter

285
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:02,458
for lettin' herself
get captured.

286
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:05,083
Well...? Get goin'!

287
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:06,250
Right...!

288
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:08,250
Thanks Rebecca... and Balar...

289
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:09,416
I appreciate it.

290
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,750
Sure...! It was no problem.

291
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:14,083
I hope our paths cross
again in the future,

292
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:15,541
Keisaku Sato.

293
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,833
Well then...

294
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:22,666
Transposer of
Corpses and Bodies...

295
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,333
I shall leave
the Tokyo Post...

296
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:26,500
in your hands,
Ernest Flieder.

297
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:28,666
As you wish,
Supreme Commander.

298
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:32,666
We promise that we'll do
our very best, Sophie!

299
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,875
And any minute now...

300
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:38,875
Wilhelmina's request for help
will be answered by Rebecca.

301
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:40,416
Then, of course...

302
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,875
there's the letter
that I sent her.

303
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:46,875
You have my
eternal gratitude.

304
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:48,708
I'll see you tomorrow...

305
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:50,500
at the rendezvous point.

306
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:54,666
Rebecca Reed has answered
our call for help.

307
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,750
Our luck has changed!

308
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:58,375
Yes, indeed...

309
00:18:58,458 --> 00:18:59,916
It's about time.

310
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,541
"Dear Wilhelmina Carmel,

311
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:06,416
a Flame Haze is coming to you
with classified information...

312
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,625
Please make sure that you
cooperate with them."

313
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,875
The Scatterer of
Sparkling Light...

314
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:24,541
Rebecca Reed is now...

315
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:26,500
assisting Wilhelmina...

316
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,416
and so will they...

317
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,375
Yes... I hope she appreciates
the sacrifice you've made.

318
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:42,333
Your bath is ready,
Lady Shana.

319
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:03,125
That moment keeps playing
over in my mind...

320
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:05,125
Yuji was trying to grab me.

321
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,666
No...

322
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:10,833
That's not it...

323
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:17,000
He was reaching
for my hand.

324
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:19,041
I remember...

325
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:23,000
I once held someone else's
hand in the same way.

326
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:27,791
Please you have to go.

327
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:33,625
Thank you for
taking care of us.

328
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:35,625
It wasn't for you!

329
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:37,500
None of it...

330
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:38,916
was for you...

331
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,750
I did it out of
love for Mathilde!

332
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:45,875
I know what it
means to love, too.

333
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:49,541
Is that so?

334
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:50,750
Uh-huh.

335
00:20:57,916 --> 00:20:59,625
I see...

336
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:00,750
Well...

337
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:02,833
I feel the same
way about you.

338
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,500
Please... take my hand...

339
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:15,250
'Kay.

340
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:29,791
After everything
I've been through...

341
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:37,583
And everything
I've seen...

342
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:39,541
I want us to be
together, Shana.

343
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:46,458
I knew the power Yuji held
in the palm of his hand...

344
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:49,625
The power of his touch...

345
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:52,125
Because it's a feeling...

346
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:54,750
I've felt before.

347
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:56,750
There's an Unrestricted Spell...

348
00:21:56,833 --> 00:21:58,791
that is so powerful...

349
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:02,291
it is capable of making the
strongest Crimson Lord...

350
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:04,083
collapse upon his knees.

351
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:07,333
Someday...

352
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:08,666
you'll find it.

353
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:13,666
Guess what?
I did it, Shiro.

354
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:17,541
I found the Unrestricted
Spell you told me about...

355
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:18,791
Yes...

356
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:21,375
It's love.

357
00:22:33,708 --> 00:22:34,750
What happened?

358
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:40,083
The Supreme Throne!

359
00:22:40,166 --> 00:22:43,375
You're no longer... needed.

360
00:22:43,458 --> 00:22:49,416
[Music]

361
00:24:14,625 --> 00:24:17,625
A captive Shana stands
helpless before Hecate,

362
00:24:17,708 --> 00:24:19,833
who attacks her
without warning.

363
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:21,375
Meanwhile, in Misaki City,

364
00:24:21,458 --> 00:24:24,375
Yoshida sees a familiar
face from her past.

365
00:24:24,458 --> 00:24:26,791
Next time, on Shakugan
no Shana Final:

366
00:24:26,875 --> 00:24:28,291
"The Divine Gate."
