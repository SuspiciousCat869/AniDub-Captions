1
00:00:49,833 --> 00:00:52,000
Your blade, my master...

2
00:00:52,083 --> 00:00:54,166
As always, I am
your servant.

3
00:01:03,458 --> 00:01:05,125
You have done well.

4
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:25,083
[Music]

5
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:08,208
Those are...

6
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:09,583
Yes...

7
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:11,500
those are the
Ancient Flame Haze

8
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:13,041
who were entombed with me.

9
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:15,458
They've paid the
ultimate sacrifice

10
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:17,791
for thwarting my plans.

11
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:19,916
Thousands of years
have passed and yet...

12
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,250
they're still determined
to stand in your way.

13
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:24,208
Their devotion to the
cause is impressive,

14
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:25,208
to say the least.

15
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:26,750
I agree...

16
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:28,833
Though it may
delay our journey,

17
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:30,291
we must deal with
them in a respectful,

18
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:33,166
yet forceful, manner...

19
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,583
For I will not be
denied passage.

20
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:45,625
The catalyst needed
to change the world

21
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:47,666
lies at the end
of this pathway.

22
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,166
Once it's mine,

23
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:52,083
I can free Shana from her
fate as a Flame Haze.

24
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,375
I gotta go...

25
00:03:58,458 --> 00:04:00,625
I don't have time to
waste on these idiots.

26
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,750
Aster!

27
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:27,333
Hecate... you can go ahead
and get to safety...

28
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:30,041
We will join you as soon
as we're finished here.

29
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:31,541
As you wish, sir.

30
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:38,625
-Domino!
-Right! At your service!

31
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:41,125
It's time for us to
get going, Professor!

32
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:43,041
You can finish
collecting data later.

33
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:44,541
Oh! Wow...!

34
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:46,916
We've just hit the
mother load here, haven't we? !

35
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,125
Yeah, yeah... Now come on,
we've got to go!

36
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:54,625
the water I drink, even
my very existence!

37
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:00,625
Shall we finish 'em?

38
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:03,625
Shouldn't take
but a minute...

39
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:04,958
Watch this:

40
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:06,666
Tartaros: Isolate!

41
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:15,500
I'm not gonna let
you have all the fun!

42
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:26,291
We have lost all contact with
Fortress Commander, Fecor.

43
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:30,333
Without him, it will
be next to impossible

44
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:32,916
to keep the Divine
Gate concealed.

45
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,416
I suspect the
enemy will soon

46
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,791
launch a full-scale attack.

47
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:39,250
I don't understand...

48
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:41,250
How did the intruders
so easily infiltrate

49
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:42,750
the Palace of the Stars?

50
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:01,541
I have to tell the others
about the Divine Gate!

51
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,250
Where am I?

52
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:16,083
It looks like...

53
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:17,500
Heaven's Road...

54
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:26,833
Is this...

55
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:28,833
The Palace of the Stars? !

56
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:32,416
It is, indeed.

57
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,458
Is it to your liking...
Princess?

58
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:41,583
It's understandable that you
want to do some exploring...

59
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:43,291
However, I find
it worrisome

60
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:46,208
you're not accompanied
by your attendants.

61
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:48,125
Don't tell me you were
finally successful

62
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:51,250
in breaking the
bonds of Tartaros?

63
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:53,500
Allow me to
introduce myself...

64
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:54,875
My name is Uvall,

65
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:58,041
I am the Chaotic Beat
of Burdening Drums.

66
00:06:58,125 --> 00:07:00,458
I sincerely hope you won't
consider me a braggart

67
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:03,875
for telling you that I am a
powerful Crimson Lord.

68
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:06,291
I've been charged with
the duty of protecting

69
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:09,291
the Palace of the Stars
from intruders.

70
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:12,416
Therefore, I have a question
to ask you, Princess...

71
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,666
Who, precisely, are you?

72
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:21,416
Who am I?

73
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:27,125
The Flaming-Haired
Blazing-Eyed Hunter...

74
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:28,083
Shana!

75
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:31,333
You're a Flame Haze?

76
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:36,583
In that case, there's
absolutely no reason...

77
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:39,458
for me to hold
back against you!

78
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:43,000
It's quite a shame...

79
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:46,500
I foresee us doing a great
damage to this chamber.

80
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:48,291
Why are you not
attacking me?

81
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:49,583
Are you scared?

82
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:51,416
You've only been in
captivity a few days,

83
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,250
surely you haven't
completely forgotten

84
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:54,708
how to fight in that time.

85
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:58,750
I don't think so...

86
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,708
But there's
only one way...

87
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:05,208
to find out!

88
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:09,541
You don't sound very sure
of yourself, Princess.

89
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:11,166
Given the urgency of
the situation,

90
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,250
I'm afraid I'm going to have
to make short work of you,

91
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:14,708
my dear.

92
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:26,791
We're now deep within the
Palace and we've yet to find

93
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:28,708
any sort of
room or cell

94
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:30,541
that would be capable
of holding her.

95
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:32,625
Continue searching.

96
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:34,708
I'm sure the Mystes
has her well hidden...

97
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:35,708
in the hopes of
protecting her

98
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:37,958
from the battle
raging outside...

99
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:40,333
But I have no doubt we'll
be able to find her.

100
00:08:57,833 --> 00:09:00,083
It's the Crystal Altar...

101
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:01,625
I don't understand...

102
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,458
what on Earth is
it doing here?

103
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:05,041
Inexplicable.

104
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:08,958
I wouldn't touch that...

105
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:13,000
Unless you want them
to know you're here,

106
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:15,541
Specialist of Everything.

107
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:17,416
We meet again,
Spiral Organ...

108
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,208
It has been far too long.

109
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:32,250
Synchronization complete.

110
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:42,583
Is it me...

111
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:45,833
or are they suddenly
attacking more vigorously?

112
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:47,875
Now that the Crypta
has been destroyed,

113
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:49,916
it appears they are
no longer concerned

114
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,250
with protecting the
fortress from damage.

115
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:53,750
Ah...

116
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:55,500
With that in mind,
I am torn over

117
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:57,500
whether or not we
should remain here.

118
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:00,750
While I think it would be
foolish to disregard

119
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:03,125
the mysterious object
floating above us...

120
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:06,333
It would be far worse
to attack without

121
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:07,875
first identifying it.

122
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:10,166
Ah... Until the
Specialist of Everything

123
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,750
rescues the Flaming-Haired
Blazing-Eyed Hunter...

124
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:17,375
We shall keep fighting.

125
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:18,958
Set's Wheel!

126
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:21,250
Deploy Qadesh's
Blood Seal.

127
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:22,291
Activate...

128
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:23,750
Deploying.

129
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:25,291
Synchronizing to
Qadesh's Blood Pulse.

130
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:34,000
Oh wow...! The geezers
are kickin' major butt!

131
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:35,708
Don't you think your time
would be better spent

132
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:37,583
rallying your
troops, Purson,

133
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:40,291
The Majestic Lion's
Bellowing Call?

134
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:41,625
I disagree.

135
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:43,166
Your friend's
destructive power

136
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,750
is quite impressive...

137
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:46,875
However, I know that had
you two been there,

138
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:48,791
the damage would have
been threefold.

139
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:50,083
That is why...

140
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:52,750
I lured you to join me
in this dance called war.

141
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:54,375
Well, I'm not much
of a dancer, pal...!

142
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:57,958
So don't get pissed off when I
end up stompin' on your foot!

143
00:10:58,041 --> 00:11:00,500
The old man's too big to
dodge this loser's attacks,

144
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:01,791
so I lured
him over here.

145
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:04,166
At least, that's what I
thought I was doin'...

146
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:07,750
Turns out that mangy cat was
the one who was baitin' me!

147
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,458
I'm always telling you to
respect your elders,

148
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:11,958
and when you finally do, it
blows up in your face.

149
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:13,583
I'll forgive ya for it...

150
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:14,958
as long as you'll let me
blow somethin' up

151
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,291
in his face...!

152
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,666
Hear that, ya
feline freak? !

153
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,875
If you think such a
threat will frighten me...

154
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:23,000
you're dead wrong.

155
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:24,166
For you see...

156
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,083
I have an Unrestricted
Spell, so strong,

157
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:28,166
it'll knock you to your knees!

158
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,500
I'll play you...

159
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:31,291
my Fanfare!

160
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:32,916
The last tune
you'll ever hear!

161
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:37,083
I don't think so!

162
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:38,750
Fanfare!

163
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:44,000
You're not bad...!

164
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:45,208
I can't believe you've
made it through this fight

165
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:47,916
without bein' hit by
one of our attacks!

166
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,125
Thanks, but flattery
will get you nowhere.

167
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:03,916
I must say, you've
surprised me, Spiral Organ...

168
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,250
I never would've
expected you

169
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:06,750
to lead us through
the Palace,

170
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:09,041
much less, provide
us with information.

171
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:10,708
Inconceivable.

172
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:12,666
What is it you
want in return?

173
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:17,875
Specialist of
Everything...

174
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:20,750
all I ask is that you
refrain from entering the

175
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:23,625
central area of the
Palace which lies ahead.

176
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:30,750
If you refuse I'll
have to fight you...

177
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,416
on the behalf
of Bal Masque...

178
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,333
and I don't think either of
us wants it to come to that.

179
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:38,791
Indeed, we won't
go further...

180
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:41,416
Know that we do not
consider your cooperation

181
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,791
with Bal Masque to
be a betrayal...

182
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:46,291
You are simply attempting
to achieve a goal.

183
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:49,250
However, should you keep me
from achieving my own goal...

184
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:51,416
I will exterminate you.

185
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,041
I completely understand...

186
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:54,666
I don't suppose I
could persuade you

187
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,500
to leave the
Palace altogether?

188
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:57,833
Persuade me how?

189
00:12:57,916 --> 00:13:00,041
If you'll agree,
I shall offer...

190
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:01,666
two things to you...

191
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:05,041
The first of which
being information.

192
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:07,250
And the second...

193
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:10,791
Thanks to the
Spiral Organ,

194
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:12,375
we were able to
verify her safety...

195
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:16,916
The Flaming-Haired
Blazing-Eyed Hunter escaped...

196
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,625
she was able to do so
without assistance from me.

197
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:21,291
Astounding.

198
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:23,291
While I'm certain our
attack helped create

199
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:25,875
a diversion that allowed
her to break free...

200
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:28,083
if she had been left
to her own devices,

201
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:30,458
I think she would've
been fine indeed.

202
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:32,291
You should be proud.

203
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:36,791
I am proud of what
she's achieved...

204
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:38,791
That said, I can't help
but feel a tinge

205
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:41,500
of sadness deep
within my heart...

206
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:44,916
Because she no longer has
any reason to depend on me.

207
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,250
I suddenly feel
so useless...

208
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:51,583
Snap out of it.

209
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:55,125
Indeed, I shouldn't be
wasting my time sulking

210
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:57,250
when there are pressing
issues at hand...

211
00:13:57,333 --> 00:13:58,541
It's better spent...

212
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:01,416
preparing for the
moment we strike.

213
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,750
Though I am
indeed worried...

214
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:05,916
I have faith in her.

215
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,833
For now I know, she's
capable of fighting

216
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:09,416
this battle all on her own.

217
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:27,958
I thought you unworthy
of the God of Atonement's

218
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:29,875
contract and our
master's attention...

219
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:33,000
I stand corrected, you
are quite worthy indeed.

220
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:34,166
That was nothing...

221
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,583
wait and see...

222
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,625
I'm just getting
warmed up.

223
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:39,500
Talk is cheap,
little girl...

224
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:40,708
so let's see
what you can do!

225
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:43,916
I haven't tapped in to
my full potential...

226
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I've gotta find it...

227
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:48,333
or else, I'll never
be able to defeat him!

228
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:06,750
The Crypta continues
to collapse.

229
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:08,958
It's only a matter of
time before the Flame Haze

230
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,000
pinpoint the
precise location

231
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:12,583
of the Palace of the Stars.

232
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:14,041
What am I saying?

233
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:15,833
They're likely communicating
with the intruders

234
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:18,791
and therefore already
aware of our coordinates.

235
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:21,291
If that's true, I know
what Sophie Sawallisch's

236
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:22,583
next move will be...

237
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:28,083
Attention: this is
an emergency message.

238
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:30,833
Respond regardless of
present circumstance.

239
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:32,583
Do you read me commanders
of the Eastern

240
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:34,250
and Western forces,

241
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:35,958
Dashing Earthly Fiend, Ribesal

242
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:38,125
and Burning
Agitation, Haborym?

243
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:40,791
This is Ribesal.
I read you loud and clear.

244
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:42,250
Haborym reporting.

245
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:43,583
What is it,
Supreme Commander?

246
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:45,125
I order you to
cease combat

247
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:47,958
and return to the Palace
of the Stars at once.

248
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:49,416
I have reason to believe
it will be targeted

249
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,083
in a surprise attack by The
Braider of Trembling Might

250
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:54,375
and the Flame Haze Army.

251
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:55,833
A surprise attack? !

252
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:57,958
Do you have evidence to
support this conclusion?

253
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:00,083
I will fully brief you
on the matter later.

254
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:02,250
It is imperative that you
issue a withdrawal order

255
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:04,083
to all troops immediately.

256
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:05,125
Understood!

257
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,708
Let them try
their damndest...

258
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:11,583
But the Flame Haze
will never set foot

259
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:13,625
in the Palace of the Stars.

260
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:15,708
It is surrounded by a
protective barrier

261
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:17,958
of Unrestricted Spells.

262
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:24,958
We should be
getting close.

263
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:27,125
Yes.

264
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:28,541
Captain...

265
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:30,291
I'm sorry to keep
asking you this but...

266
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:31,583
are we all clear?

267
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:33,291
Yes, ma'am...
So far, so good...

268
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:35,083
We've been scanning
signals in the area,

269
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:36,666
and we haven't
encountered anything

270
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:40,291
that would require a
reevaluation of the operation.

271
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:42,000
Now... just sit back...

272
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:43,583
and allow us
to demonstrate

273
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,583
how helpful your
human allies can be.

274
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:47,000
Oh, we're aware...

275
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:49,083
The entirety of our
army is dependent...

276
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:51,333
on the might of
the human race.

277
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:53,250
No need to worry, we've
cast Seals over

278
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:56,333
every radar facility in
the surrounding area.

279
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:58,500
I've gone to great lengths
to ensure we don't leave

280
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:01,291
any trace of
this operation.

281
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:04,041
Guess I should check the map
one last time before we go...

282
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:06,583
Everything looks clear
along the rendezvous route;

283
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:08,541
I don't see any signs
of inclement weather.

284
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:10,750
Good, I'm glad to
hear it, Francois...

285
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:12,666
I can't thank you enough
for all your help...

286
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,541
We wouldn't have been able
to conduct this operation

287
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:17,000
without your knowledge
of meteorology.

288
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:19,750
The same can be said about
the Specialist of Everything

289
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:22,000
and the detailed coordinates
that she sent to us.

290
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,583
We are incredibly
fortunate to have

291
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:25,458
such amazing allies.

292
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:27,666
Commander Sawallisch,
we're approximately

293
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,583
three minutes from
the drop point.

294
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:31,708
Thanks for
letting me know.

295
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,791
This is it...

296
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:38,125
The moment we have all
been waiting for...

297
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:39,708
Our turn to strike back!

298
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:41,916
We have been
given an opportunity

299
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,958
to avenge our allies
who were struck down.

300
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:47,458
This operation depends
upon us defeating the enemy

301
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:49,541
before their
reinforcements arrive.

302
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:51,833
Our victory will not only
serve as an example

303
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:54,541
that future Flame Haze
will strive to attain...

304
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:56,416
but as a warning to
any Crimson Denizens

305
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,333
who might consider
attacking us.

306
00:17:58,416 --> 00:17:59,750
That being said...

307
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:02,375
this endeavor will never
become a reality...

308
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:04,958
if we are unable to defeat
them in the first place.

309
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:11,541
Gentlemen, we shall now
commence Operation Crossing!

310
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:21,541
He just won't let up, will
he...? This sucks...!

311
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:23,750
We shouldn't be wastin'
our time with this guy!

312
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:26,166
I'm sure he feels the
same way about us.

313
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,500
True... We'll have the advantage
if we can figure out

314
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:29,791
where he's hidin'!

315
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,791
I found ya!

316
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:40,958
Watch out! He's
to your right!

317
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:49,666
I should've known
he was bluffing...!

318
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:52,583
Your reflexes are impressive
but there's no escaping ...

319
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:54,500
You're mine now.

320
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:56,208
Damn... we're screwed...

321
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:57,625
We won't make it!

322
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,958
An enemy attack?

323
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:06,083
Why are they
flying so low? .

324
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:08,541
Where did those
planes come from...?

325
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:10,541
Yeah, you're outta luck, pal.

326
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:34,541
They transported
their army by air? !

327
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:36,166
I suspected an
attack on the Palace

328
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,583
but I didn't anticipate it

329
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:40,583
being the entirety of
their forces simultaneously.

330
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:42,583
We must counterattack
at once.

331
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:45,708
I don't like that sound...

332
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:53,041
What's happening...?!

333
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:54,583
We can't descend now!

334
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:16,166
Bye bye!

335
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:07,375
She's here; The Braider
of Trembling Might,

336
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:09,083
Sophie Sawallisch...

337
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:13,375
The Palace of
the Stars descended,

338
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:16,458
shattering the protective
barrier surrounding it.

339
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:17,666
We now have an opening.

340
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:23,583
Indeed, this is our
chance to go help her.

341
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,583
She's some kind
of monster!

342
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:31,666
The longer we fight
the stronger she gets!

343
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,666
I can't keep this
up much longer...

344
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:36,583
Is this a joke?

345
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:38,666
Am I being sacrificed
to the God of Atonement? !

346
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,791
It's still not enough...

347
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:48,208
I have to think back...

348
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:50,125
to what I was taught
in the beginning.

349
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:54,291
Alastor...

350
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:56,458
A Flames Haze's power
derives not only

351
00:21:56,541 --> 00:21:59,083
from the image of strength
the contractor holds...

352
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:02,666
but also from its fusion
with their Crimson Lord's power.

353
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:07,708
Therefore, in an effort to avoid
unnecessary preconceptions,

354
00:22:07,791 --> 00:22:09,333
the Flaming-Haired
Blazing-Eyed Hunter

355
00:22:09,416 --> 00:22:11,625
is not given a specific
fighting style.

356
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:14,666
After questioning
my relation to the

357
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,958
Flaming-Haired
Blazing-Eyed Hunter...

358
00:22:18,541 --> 00:22:21,208
I've finally realized
that we are...

359
00:22:21,291 --> 00:22:23,166
One and the same!

360
00:22:25,541 --> 00:22:27,166
If I were to choose a
symbol to represent

361
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,958
my power as a Flame Haze...

362
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:32,916
What would it be? !

363
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,833
I cannot allow
myself to fall victim

364
00:22:34,916 --> 00:22:36,833
to the God of Atonement's
contractor...

365
00:22:36,916 --> 00:22:38,791
I must do something!

366
00:22:46,125 --> 00:22:47,875
What symbolizes...

367
00:22:47,958 --> 00:22:50,166
not only my strength...

368
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:52,666
but who I really am...?

369
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:55,916
The Flaming-Haired
Blazing-Eyed Hunter...

370
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,208
Shana!

371
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,208
True Crimson!

372
00:23:03,791 --> 00:23:04,916
Emblaze!

373
00:23:07,166 --> 00:23:08,458
Judgment!

374
00:23:14,583 --> 00:23:16,291
Conviction!

375
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,708
I was hoping we might run
into you here, milady.

376
00:23:56,791 --> 00:23:58,666
What a joyous reunion!

377
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,375
Thanks, Wilhelmina.

378
00:24:03,583 --> 00:24:04,791
Let's go!

379
00:24:17,041 --> 00:24:18,666
Yuji...

380
00:24:20,583 --> 00:24:22,541
After Operation
Crossing's success,

381
00:24:22,625 --> 00:24:25,166
the Flame Haze suddenly find
themselves with the advantage.

382
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:26,958
In a last ditch
effort to turn the tide,

383
00:24:27,041 --> 00:24:28,625
Decarabia makes
an appearance

384
00:24:28,708 --> 00:24:30,375
on the front lines
of the battlefield.

385
00:24:30,458 --> 00:24:32,625
Next time, on Shakugan
no Shana Final:

386
00:24:32,708 --> 00:24:34,125
"Feelings Heard."
