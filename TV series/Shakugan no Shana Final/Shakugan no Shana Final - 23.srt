1
00:00:56,541 --> 00:00:58,166
I got a bad feelin'.

2
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:00,000
I thought we
foiled his plans.

3
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:01,750
Why's he smirkin'
like that?

4
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:03,375
We completely
rewrote the spell

5
00:01:03,458 --> 00:01:05,666
so there's no way he could
have changed it back.

6
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:07,458
Something has gone wrong.

7
00:01:11,583 --> 00:01:14,375
As you can see,
your tactic failed.

8
00:01:45,916 --> 00:01:46,916
What an honor.

9
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,666
I can't believe my luck.

10
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,666
Disciples of the God of Guidance
may wander for millennia

11
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,041
without ever
being called upon!

12
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:56,541
Having seen a dazzling
new creation,

13
00:01:56,625 --> 00:01:58,708
the glorious task of
summoning the divine

14
00:01:58,791 --> 00:02:00,916
has been bestowed upon me,

15
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,333
Rofocale, the Invitation
of Cheerful Playing!

16
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:07,000
He's going to summon
the God of Guidance now?

17
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:09,666
What could he have seen
that would lead to this?

18
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:21,083
Did we screw up somehow?

19
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:22,125
No way!

20
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:23,875
Not even the Psalm's creator

21
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:26,791
could restore the spell after
the number we did on it.

22
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:30,625
Soon his power will
be replenished

23
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:32,791
by the Midnight Lost Child.

24
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:35,458
Is he going to use it
to start over again?

25
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:36,916
No.

26
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,708
We've come too far.

27
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:41,833
The Strategist and I have
come up with a much better way

28
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:43,958
to make use of the
Midnight Lost Child.

29
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:49,291
The Seeking Researcher was so
fascinated by the Treasure Tool

30
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:50,875
he began an
investigation,

31
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:52,708
and after the battle
with the Engaged Link

32
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:56,000
he made two very
important discoveries.

33
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:58,875
The first, was the secret
of its functionality.

34
00:02:58,958 --> 00:03:02,250
He learned the intricacies of
its ability to overcome loss.

35
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:03,708
A feature that
is symbolized

36
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:06,500
by an eternally
ticking clock.

37
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:08,416
The second, was the
nature of the energy

38
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,458
used to compensate the loss.

39
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:12,041
It is an elastic force,

40
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:15,833
the combination of the warping
a lost existence creates,

41
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:18,791
and the world's attempt
to maintain balance.

42
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:20,166
In other words,

43
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,750
it's the distortion caused
by the Crimson Denizens

44
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:24,458
in this world.

45
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:25,625
With this knowledge,

46
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:28,000
the professor was
able to devise a way

47
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:29,833
to extract
unlimited power

48
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:32,291
from the distortion at
the stroke of midnight,

49
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:34,666
when the Treasure Tool's
energy is replenished.

50
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:37,791
I have won.

51
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:40,291
The Flame Haze Army put
forth a valiant effort,

52
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:42,333
but I'm afraid it wasn't
enough to outsmart me

53
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:43,708
and my loyal servants.

54
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:45,583
Once the clock
strikes twelve,

55
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:48,458
I shall be an
unstoppable force!

56
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:50,958
Nothing stands in my way!

57
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:56,208
What do you intend to do

58
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:59,041
with your massive amount
of newfound power?

59
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:00,041
Everything.

60
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:03,833
Although I am the
God of Creation,

61
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:05,750
I am only capable
of creating that

62
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:08,291
which is wished and
desired by others,

63
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:12,166
but now I have the freedom
to create however I see fit.

64
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,416
This is the plan I concocted
with my Strategist,

65
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,083
the Judge of Paradoxes.

66
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:21,375
It is the original goal
of the Grand Order and...

67
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:24,500
...the greatest
deception in history.

68
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:26,708
There's gotta be
a way to stop him!

69
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:28,375
I'm afraid it's too late.

70
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:32,000
I will use the Psalm
of the Grand Order

71
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:36,083
to create the paradise, Xanadu,
for you, my Denizens!

72
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:37,458
It's almost time.

73
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:41,375
As your humble servant,
I call upon thee Shaher,

74
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:42,666
the God of Guidance,

75
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,625
the Thunderous Chant
of Awakening.

76
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:46,166
Hear my plea!

77
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,583
The Festival of Creation.

78
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:28,666
What's happening?

79
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,166
The God of Creation is
summoning his divine power.

80
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:41,791
I shall be your vessel!

81
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:52,458
Is that?

82
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:53,875
Talk about bad timing!

83
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:02,125
Impossible!

84
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:45,458
An almighty deed
nears completion.

85
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:47,041
It's the God of Guidance!

86
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:50,375
The Chant of Thunderous
Awakening, Shaher!

87
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,541
Could the simultaneous
summoning of divine power

88
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:57,500
disrupt the Grand Order?

89
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:01,500
It shines with a dazzling
brilliance, unlike any other.

90
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:03,083
No matter how hard I try,

91
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:04,791
I can't seem to
block her out.

92
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:06,666
She's forcing
me to listen.

93
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:09,833
Is this the oracle of
the God of Guidance?

94
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:11,875
We didn't prevent the
creation of Xanadu

95
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:14,083
but at least our backup
plan worked out.

96
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:16,458
I mean, it could've
been worse, right?

97
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:18,166
I don't know whether
I should rejoice

98
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,958
or curse my own weakness.

99
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:21,583
The Denizens may
not be forced

100
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:23,541
to obey the God of
Guidance's words,

101
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:25,166
but they'll never
forget them!

102
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,791
Now all we need her to do

103
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:28,750
is advocate the
"no eating humans" rule!

104
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:33,541
I'm so sorry we let
you down everybody!

105
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:34,958
We don't know
what he saw,

106
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:38,125
so there's no telling
what's going to happen next.

107
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,791
Protect this new light,

108
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:43,583
the product of the
Engaged Link's love.

109
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:45,625
-What?
-The Engaged Link?

110
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:47,791
What happened to
no eating humans?

111
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:55,416
You have been bequeathed
the greatest gift of all,

112
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,208
Why Pheles and Johann?

113
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:02,083
Is it possible that
whatever's inside that bottle

114
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:04,916
caught the attention
of the God of Guidance?

115
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
May hope fill your hearts

116
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:10,166
as you set forth on your
journey to the new land,

117
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:13,250
for the new light,
the Heir to Both Worlds,

118
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:14,250
will be amongst you.

119
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:16,041
The Heir to Both Worlds?

120
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:17,625
What the hell is
she talking about?

121
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:19,708
A thing of myth
and legend.

122
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,791
The combining of
Power of Existence

123
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:24,875
to create a progeny of the
human and Crimson Worlds.

124
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:26,166
To put it simply,

125
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,625
it's a half-human,
half-Denizen being.

126
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,166
Is that even possible?

127
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:34,666
A Crimson Lord and
her contractor tried.

128
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,958
But the former Flaming-Haired
Blazing-Eyed Hunter

129
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:39,125
and I stopped them.

130
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:42,250
It'd take an incredible
amount of Power of Existence

131
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:44,666
to even come close
to pulling it off.

132
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,875
Well, then they picked
the perfect time

133
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:48,666
'cause there's gonna be
plenty floating around

134
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,583
once the Denizens
leave for Xanadu.

135
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:54,750
No joke, and there'll be tons
of it on the other side, too.

136
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:56,500
Those two are smart.

137
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:58,666
I urge you.

138
00:08:58,750 --> 00:08:59,750
Pheles.

139
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:01,333
Johann.

140
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:05,000
You used the creation of the
new world to your advantage.

141
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:07,208
You knew this would be
your one and only chance

142
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:08,625
to fulfill your desire.

143
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:13,458
Seek a new way of being.

144
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:15,750
A new...

145
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:17,166
...way of being?

146
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:24,250
Heed my words of guidance!

147
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:43,750
What a surprise!

148
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,416
My interest is piqued.

149
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,875
Still, I have work to do.

150
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:52,625
The preparations for the
Grand Order are complete.

151
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:55,041
I will now begin
my creation.

152
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,958
I ask that you have
faith in me, your god,

153
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:02,625
and do not allow the words of
other deities to affect you.

154
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:07,333
Kneel before me,
my beloved Denizens.

155
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:11,000
And imagine, in your hearts,

156
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:13,125
the world that you desire.

157
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:19,958
I will gather your
prayers and use them

158
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:23,500
to open the portal to
your paradise, Xanadu!

159
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:33,708
Until we meet again.

160
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:35,541
My priestess,
born of wishes.

161
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:43,666
I call to the heavens!

162
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:48,416
My beloved Crimson Denizens,

163
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,833
your prayers will
now be answered!

164
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,583
It is done.

165
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:31,625
What? How can this be?

166
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:41,250
Impossible.

167
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:42,708
The Psalm of the Grand Order

168
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:46,250
still contains the alterations
made by the Flame Haze!

169
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:48,291
But why didn't it change?

170
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:52,625
Something inexplicable has
happened, my Strategist.

171
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:54,000
Master!

172
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:56,666
At the very moment
of creation.

173
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,625
My beloved Crimson Denizens
told me that

174
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:01,375
this is what they desire.

175
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,666
It's what they
have chosen.

176
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:10,541
They must have been
persuaded by the Flame Haze.

177
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:12,416
Why else would they choose
to live in a paradise

178
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,583
without freedom?

179
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:16,000
But, even if that
were the case,

180
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:18,750
you're the one who has
final say in the matter.

181
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:21,208
You have the power to
overrule their choice!

182
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:23,750
So, why didn't
you, Master?

183
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:28,958
I couldn't.

184
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:33,125
Because, I was touched by
the pain in their eyes.

185
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:45,083
Master, now your
heart gets to you?

186
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:46,708
Oh, dear.

187
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:48,708
Was I wrong to
grant their desire?

188
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:53,125
No, sir.

189
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:54,375
If that is your will,

190
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:57,125
then I assure you it
shall not be contested.

191
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:58,875
Very well, then.

192
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:01,250
Thank you, Strategist.

193
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:04,916
Are you ready to venture to the
Crimson Denizen's paradise?

194
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,041
Yes.

195
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:07,958
I'll wait for you
at the Shrine.

196
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:17,583
The new world, Xanadu,
has been created.

197
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:26,583
General, do I have
your permission

198
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:27,875
to call off our forces

199
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:30,166
now that the
battle is over?

200
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,458
Yeah, but tell
them to watch out

201
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:34,166
for the Gods of the Earth.

202
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,416
While I doubt that they're
gonna keep fighting,

203
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,416
I don't wanna'
take any chances.

204
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:43,958
Call Ribesal, the
Dashing Earthly Fiend!

205
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,208
Master!

206
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:57,750
I order you to be
the first Denizen

207
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:59,375
to go to the new world.

208
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:01,708
Will you obey, Wanderer?

209
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:02,833
Yes, sir!

210
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:06,708
Now that our paradise
has been created,

211
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:10,208
Bal Masque will be disbanded
until further notice.

212
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:13,125
So feel free to wander the
new world however you wish.

213
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:14,291
Thank you.

214
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:18,208
Is something wrong?

215
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:20,125
The Yaeger.

216
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:22,875
He doesn't wanna
leave Pirsoyn.

217
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:23,958
Ah.

218
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:30,791
You had better hurry.

219
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:33,083
I would hate for the two
of you to lose the honor

220
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:34,958
of being the first
to step foot there.

221
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,333
Yes, sir!

222
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:37,583
Let's go, Pirsoyn!

223
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,791
Did you see that?

224
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:01,041
They went to Xanadu.

225
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:02,125
Does that mean
we can, too?

226
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:03,708
We can go!

227
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:05,125
To Xanadu!

228
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:37,708
We have achieved our
goal, Bal Masque!

229
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:40,291
I am proud of
every one of you.

230
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:42,125
I know the path
has been difficult

231
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:44,625
and we have lost many
comrades along the way,

232
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:46,708
but this is the time
for celebration,

233
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:49,458
as our dreams have
become reality.

234
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:51,083
Now, my loyal servants,

235
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:53,500
I ask that you make your
way to the new world

236
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:55,416
we have created together!

237
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,791
We will gladly follow you,

238
00:15:56,875 --> 00:15:59,125
our master, the
Snake of the Festival!

239
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:17,875
We should be going
as well, Master,

240
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:19,958
they'll be looking to
you for leadership.

241
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:21,250
True.

242
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:24,541
I hate to go, but I
shall obey you, Bel-Peol.

243
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:28,916
Release your
chains, Tartaros!

244
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:45,416
I will never forget you;

245
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,375
the human who dared
to use the gods

246
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:48,791
to achieve his own desire.

247
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:52,333
That sounds like a
compliment.

248
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:53,583
It is.

249
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:55,458
It pains me to
leave you behind

250
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:58,041
as we go on to paradise.

251
00:16:58,125 --> 00:16:59,416
It's okay.

252
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,333
You've done enough for me.

253
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:03,833
I must say I'm surprised
you haven't asked us to stay

254
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:05,250
and fight by your side,

255
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:07,791
considering that the most
critical battle awaits you.

256
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:09,000
Yuji Sakai.

257
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:10,500
After all you've
been through,

258
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:12,916
is this the best
outcome for you?

259
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,041
It's kinda hard for me to
say just yet, but I think so.

260
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:18,041
I don't think you stand
a chance against them

261
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:19,250
on your own.

262
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:22,083
Maybe not, but I'll
never know unless I try.

263
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:27,958
That key controls
the Tartaros

264
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:30,416
that's currently
binding Misaki City.

265
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,833
I'm sure you'll be able
to make good use of it.

266
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:33,958
Thanks a lot.

267
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:37,000
I'll stay and
fight with you.

268
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:39,375
Are you sure?

269
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,416
Yeah, I'm positive.

270
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,083
I feel like it's
the least I can do

271
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:45,083
after everything
he's done for us.

272
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:46,958
The Grand Order
is complete.

273
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:49,166
If that is what you wish,
then so be it.

274
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,041
Yes, sir!

275
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:54,000
That is what I wish.

276
00:17:58,125 --> 00:18:02,041
Yuji Sakai, the only human
to ever walk alongside me,

277
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:05,166
your bravery and strength
of will are admirable.

278
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,708
Before I leave,

279
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:09,041
there is one thing
I want you to know.

280
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:10,625
I forgive you,

281
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:13,666
for I am he who
affirms all desires.

282
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,166
Though no one else
may forgive you,

283
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,791
know that I do.

284
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,500
My dear Strategist,
I have a request,

285
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:38,958
may I tell the Flame Haze

286
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:41,375
what has become
of the new world?

287
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:42,708
If that is your wish.

288
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:49,000
Rejoice, Flame Haze!

289
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:51,583
Rejoice, Flame of Heaven!

290
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,875
The Crimson Denizens
have requested

291
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:59,375
that the devouring of humans be
prohibited in the new world!

292
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:02,708
You may not have
won the battle

293
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:05,083
but know that the
sacrifices you've made

294
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:06,625
were not in vain!

295
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:13,291
Rejoice?

296
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:14,291
Yeah, right.

297
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:15,541
Look on the bright side,

298
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:17,500
at least we're still alive.

299
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:19,666
Though it may not have
happened as we wanted,

300
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,625
the result is
still favorable.

301
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,708
Must be nice to be a god
and make your own world.

302
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:31,291
Guess we're gonna have
to find a new place

303
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:32,750
to entertain ourselves.

304
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:34,791
Now that we know humans
are gonna be safe there,

305
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:37,583
maybe it's not such a
bad idea for us to go.

306
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:39,250
Yeah, but if
that's the case,

307
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:40,958
there won't be
any work for us.

308
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:43,000
I could go for an
early retirement.

309
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:45,416
Well, Miss, looks like
we're all done here.

310
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,625
We'd rather
live in a world

311
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:48,916
where humans aren't
eaten, ya know?

312
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,291
See ya.

313
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:51,708
-Safe journeys!
-Safe journeys!

314
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:09,208
Ah.

315
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:13,250
This means we don't have to
hunt Crimson Denizens anymore.

316
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:16,541
I guess we won the
battle, in a way.

317
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:20,166
God of Atonement,
Flame of Heaven.

318
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,791
I'm honored to have
a new way to live.

319
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:24,583
As are we, old friend.

320
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:31,041
Ah.

321
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:32,458
Kazumi Yoshida.

322
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:35,708
Thank you, Specialist.

323
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:37,958
I could not have
protected her without you.

324
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:52,416
You are the reason that
they are alive right now.

325
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,833
-It is all thanks to you.
-No.

326
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:56,958
Please Khamsin,
don't die on me!

327
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:02,958
Look, you and Behemoth
protected this for me.

328
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:04,625
Don't you see?

329
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:06,583
You protected something
that meant the world

330
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:08,416
to Pheles and Johann.

331
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,958
Something so special it
got the attention of a god.

332
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:14,041
Surely that means...

333
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:15,791
They'll save
you from dying.

334
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:24,291
Miss Kazumi Yoshida,

335
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:26,166
promise you'll
never forget us.

336
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:32,041
I won't.

337
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,083
Ever!

338
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:39,208
Ah.

339
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:41,958
Steadfast Sharp
Peak, Behemoth.

340
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:45,458
You've been a
wonderful partner.

341
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:47,666
I'm only as good
as my contractor.

342
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:00,875
Ah.

343
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:02,958
This could turn out
to be a good thing.

344
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:11,541
If the prince
goes to a place

345
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:14,333
where there's no great
task awaiting him,

346
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:19,041
do you think that maybe he'll
be able to see the beast again?

347
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:20,625
Yeah.

348
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:21,875
I'm sure.

349
00:22:27,791 --> 00:22:33,750
[Music]

350
00:24:14,666 --> 00:24:16,833
The Flaming-Haired
Blazing-Eyed Hunter, Shana,

351
00:24:16,916 --> 00:24:18,833
and the Mystes,
Yuji Sakai.

352
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:21,250
After everything the two of
them have been through together,

353
00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:22,750
what will become of them now?

354
00:24:22,833 --> 00:24:24,375
What will they
leave behind?

355
00:24:24,458 --> 00:24:26,666
Next time, on
Shakugan no Shana Final:

356
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:28,500
"The End in the Distance."
