1
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:06,500
What's going on?!

2
00:01:09,375 --> 00:01:11,208
No... Yuji...!

3
00:01:11,291 --> 00:01:13,875
Let me go!

4
00:01:37,875 --> 00:01:40,125
A single Treasure Tool...

5
00:01:40,208 --> 00:01:42,958
has rendered me
completely powerless.

6
00:01:45,083 --> 00:01:51,041
[Music]

7
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:22,041
In the plan
I've proposed...

8
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:24,958
Our troops would hit the
enemy's fortified positions

9
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:28,333
while a select few stand
by to counterattack.

10
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:31,875
It's a simple yet
effective strategy.

11
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:34,791
Perhaps a little too
simple if you ask me...

12
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:37,875
We need to start
thinking outside the box.

13
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:41,166
Considering our forces outnumber
theirs significantly...

14
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,708
why don't we strike first?

15
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:47,000
We could destroy them before
they even come up with a plan.

16
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:52,958
After their agonizing
defeat in Shanghai,

17
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:54,375
it's possible the Flame Haze

18
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:56,833
will be reluctant to
strengthen their forces.

19
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:58,750
If they do attack
with a small army,

20
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:01,166
we mustn't underestimate
their bravery

21
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:04,041
as that's what led to our
downfall during the Revolution.

22
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:05,666
You're wrong
about Shanghai...

23
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:08,166
They have no choice

24
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:11,000
but to strengthen their
forces after that defeat.

25
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:14,375
After all, we're not the
only enemy they face.

26
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:19,166
I'm with the General...

27
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:22,500
There's no way we can lose
given our superior numbers.

28
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:23,916
Just say the word

29
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,083
and I'll have the Jaegers
begin scouting the enemy.

30
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:29,708
A commander should
know better!

31
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:32,208
The Strategist has
provided a plan

32
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:34,708
that will ensure
our victory!

33
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:36,250
All that remains
to be discussed,

34
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:39,625
is how we'll respond
incase of an...

35
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:41,666
Please excuse my tardiness...

36
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,416
May I interject?

37
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,416
Impudence, Decarabia!

38
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,708
You must show yourself

39
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:49,083
if you wish to speak
before two of the Trinity!

40
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:52,250
Forgive me, I
meant no disrespect.

41
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:02,625
Judge of Paradoxes,
Strategist Bel-Peol,...

42
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:04,875
and Thousand Changes,
General Sydonay...

43
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:08,083
I apologize if I have
unwittingly offended you.

44
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:09,666
Damn you!

45
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,791
Calm down...! We're in
the middle of a meeting!

46
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:15,125
Decarabia...

47
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:17,875
You could learn a thing
or two from your comrades.

48
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:19,458
Now please... leave...

49
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:22,166
before you further
delay our decision.

50
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,500
Yes, sir...

51
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,250
Forgive my intrusion.

52
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:39,416
Well now, that certainly
livened things up a little.

53
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,208
Now, let us
begin the debate!

54
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:57,791
Lady Shana?

55
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:02,916
We've cleaned the room and
replaced your sheets...

56
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,166
Is there anything else
we can do for you?

57
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,708
Then we'll take our
leave for the night...

58
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:12,208
You may summon
us at any time.

59
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:18,000
If I tried to escape...

60
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:20,791
even that weak Rinne could
defeat me as I am now.

61
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:23,708
I don't have
Nietono no Shana...

62
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:26,500
or Alastor...

63
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:29,833
I'm all alone.

64
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:48,083
Someday...

65
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:49,958
you'll find it
for yourself.

66
00:07:57,833 --> 00:07:59,083
Shiro...

67
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:17,166
It appears she's
gotten the hang of it,

68
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,208
Sophie Sawallisch.

69
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:21,875
Yes, Takemikazuchi.

70
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:22,958
She's a quick learner

71
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:24,166
but that's to be expected

72
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:27,083
from the Flaming- Haired
Blazing-Eyed Hunter.

73
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:28,083
What's next?

74
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:33,625
I suppose you could help
me write an update

75
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:35,666
to send to the Outlaw Posts...

76
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,833
I know...!

77
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:38,000
Why don't you write a letter

78
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:39,958
to the Specialist of
Everything, my dear?

79
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:41,708
Write to Wilhelmina?

80
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:44,958
No.

81
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:46,875
She'll be disappointed with me

82
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:49,625
if I write so soon
after saying goodbye...

83
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:52,666
A perfect Flame Haze
doesn't rely on anyone.

84
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:58,458
Are you having trouble
getting to sleep?

85
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:01,291
Yeah... but you didn't have
to bring me in here with you.

86
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:02,833
I know I didn't have to

87
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:05,375
but I thought that it
might help comfort you.

88
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:06,458
Though you won't admit it,

89
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:08,166
I can tell you're
feeling lonely.

90
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:14,708
Tomorrow is the last day
you'll spend with me.

91
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:17,083
Before we're forced to
go our separate ways...

92
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:19,541
I have one last lesson
to share with you.

93
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:22,875
When dealing with others,

94
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:26,291
always choose
but never refuse.

95
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:29,166
In other words, try to learn
as much as you can about someone

96
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,708
before you judge them.

97
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:33,958
If something about them
strikes you as odd...

98
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:36,250
don't run away in fear.

99
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:39,541
Whether they're a Flame Haze,
Denizen, or human...

100
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:41,833
they all deserve
the same respect.

101
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:44,458
And if they make you happy,
hold onto them...

102
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:48,208
Okay...

103
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:51,250
But...

104
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:54,625
I'm never gonna
rely on... anyone.

105
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:57,708
Because you're a perfect
Flame Haze, right?

106
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:19,250
Lady Shana-

107
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:20,416
Don't bother...

108
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,875
I know she'll see me.

109
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:23,916
Shana...?

110
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,916
I'm coming in.

111
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:29,458
It's been a while.

112
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:31,833
There's no need
to glare at me...

113
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:34,083
Talk some sense
into her, Alastor.

114
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,500
She has every right
to glare at you.

115
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:39,291
Alastor...

116
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:40,916
Are they treating
you all right?

117
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,958
Yeah... I was just
worried about you-

118
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:44,750
they haven't hurt you,
have they?

119
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:46,166
He's in good hands.

120
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:48,875
Just so you know...

121
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:51,875
I'm not forcing Alastor
to stay with me.

122
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:53,833
All you have
to do is ask...

123
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:56,666
and I'll be glad to
return your Crimson lord.

124
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:59,708
He makes it sound as though
Alastor had a choice...

125
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:03,041
Flame of Heaven,

126
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:05,208
I would be honored if
you would accompany me

127
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:07,166
so that I might
help you understand

128
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:10,250
not only Bal Masque
but our ambitions.

129
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:11,583
Please, come with me...

130
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:13,208
and then you will
see what I see.

131
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:17,125
You shall see the
true Bal Masque.

132
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:22,041
So, is there anything
that I can do for you?

133
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:24,375
You can take this
restrictive chain off of me.

134
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:27,416
I'm sorry, I can't...

135
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,833
I'm only trying
to protect you...

136
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:33,208
There may be Denizens here
who're looking to harm you...

137
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:34,916
I can't have you
wandering around.

138
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,458
If that's the case,

139
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:39,833
then you never should've brought
me here in the first place!

140
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:42,791
If I remove that chain,
you could be killed...

141
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:45,041
It's for your own
safety, Shana.

142
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:46,291
From what I've heard,

143
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:48,625
you've become a danger
to yourself lately...

144
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,416
I had to send my
guards after you

145
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,791
because you'd climbed from
the terrace to the roof...

146
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:55,291
Then you tried to cut
the chain off your wrist

147
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:56,666
with a decorative sword.

148
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,166
I must say, I panicked

149
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,041
when I heard that
you'd hurt yourself.

150
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:05,875
Shana...

151
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:11,666
What's wrong?

152
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:16,500
No!

153
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:19,375
Shana...?

154
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:20,708
What's the matter?!

155
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:23,833
I don't understand,

156
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:26,375
a single loss shouldn't
affect you like this!

157
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:28,541
Leave her alone,
Yuji Sakai!

158
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:30,250
It can't be...

159
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,083
You're acting
differently towards me

160
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:34,583
because I'm more
powerful than you now...

161
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:36,000
-Why Shana?
-No...!

162
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:38,750
Just shut up- you don't
know anything about me!

163
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,458
My, my...

164
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:54,375
If I had known I was
walking into this,

165
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:57,708
I would've knocked
before entering.

166
00:12:57,791 --> 00:12:59,000
This is an ally of mine

167
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:01,625
who has agreed to help
with the Grand Order...

168
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:03,708
Lamies, the Corpse Collector...

169
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:06,500
or Leanan Sidhe,
the Spiral Organ.

170
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:12,083
Fate brings us together in the
strangest places, doesn't it?

171
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:16,083
Flaming-Haired
Blazing-Eyed Hunter, Shana.

172
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:34,416
Did you say Shana?

173
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:37,458
I'm sorry...

174
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:38,708
but who is that?

175
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:46,333
If Bal Masque simply
intended to kill her,

176
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:49,375
there was no need for their
leader to come in person...

177
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:52,958
Indeed... There must be
some kind of Unrestricted Spell

178
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,625
suppressing her presence...

179
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:57,500
That's why Chigusa
didn't remember her.

180
00:13:57,583 --> 00:13:59,583
Complete isolation.

181
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:06,958
I can't believe
you have to go.

182
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:08,166
Thank you for the gifts

183
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,125
but you really didn't
have to do all this.

184
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:12,041
It's the least I could do,

185
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:14,666
especially after everything
you've done for me.

186
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:17,458
It's a shame your work is
pulling you away right now.

187
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:21,250
I want you to promise me...

188
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:22,875
you'll come back
to see the baby.

189
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:30,875
C'mon, just double-check,
would ya? !

190
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:34,750
We have no record of any
visitors by the name Sato, sir.

191
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:37,291
Have you confused us with
another establishment?

192
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:38,958
Lady, I'm not an idiot!

193
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:40,833
Can't you just have
him paged or something?

194
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:43,416
I'm telling you,
Keisaku Sato has to be there!

195
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:54,333
Jeez, where the
hell could he be?!

196
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:56,625
He better not have been
lyin' about goin' to Outlaw.

197
00:14:58,416 --> 00:14:59,250
May I come in?

198
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:00,708
Entre-vous!

199
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:12,125
Same time, every day,
just like clockwork...!

200
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:13,125
Was he there?

201
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:14,416
No, I kept askin'

202
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,333
but they said there
was no record of him...

203
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,625
Eventually they got
pissed and hung up on me.

204
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:22,833
Way to annoy the
crap out of 'em!

205
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:24,458
She's still out, huh?

206
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:26,666
Yeah... I was hoping
sleeping beauty

207
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,833
would snap out
of it today...

208
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:31,208
But she shows no
signs of waking.

209
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:32,875
I'm gettin' a bad
feeling about this...

210
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:35,208
Are you sure Sato
made it to Outlaw?

211
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:37,375
According to the
Specialist of Everything...

212
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:39,875
And she wouldn't have mentioned
it if she weren't sure.

213
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:42,000
That is, unless
she's playin' dumb

214
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:43,500
'cause she's hidin' something.

215
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:48,125
How can you joke at
a time like this?

216
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:51,708
If Sato's there,
why would they lie?!

217
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:53,833
What if...
instead of just calling...

218
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:57,583
We ask Wilhelmina
to pay them a visit?

219
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:59,583
It's strange she
didn't offer...

220
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:02,416
Wait a minute...

221
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,375
Uh-oh, what is it?

222
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:06,375
Here's the thing...

223
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:07,958
Faced with an impending war,

224
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:11,708
Outlaw's been sending summons
to all the Flame Haze...

225
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:14,291
which the Specialist
has been ignoring.

226
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:16,416
Even the Braider
of Trembling Might,

227
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:21,416
Sophie Sawallisch's requests
have gone unanswered.

228
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,416
But what's that got
to do with Sato?

229
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,833
I'm getting' there!

230
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:26,666
By not answering
her summons,

231
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:29,958
the Specialist is holdin' up
Outlaw's entire operation.

232
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:31,125
At this point,

233
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:32,916
I bet they'd do
just about anything

234
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,666
to persuade her
to join 'em...

235
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:37,083
even hold a friend
of hers hostage.

236
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:38,875
You think so?

237
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:42,916
Flame Haze'll do whatever
it takes to get the job done.

238
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,458
Sometimes that means
they gotta play dirty...

239
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:47,458
but Kiesaku knew what
he was gettin' into

240
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:49,375
when he accepted the job.

241
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:56,083
Hey... are you sure Margery'll
wake up if Sato comes back?

242
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:57,208
It's worth a try!

243
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:58,541
But only time will tell

244
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:00,958
if a kiss from her
prince charming will wake her.

245
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:03,250
If the prince knew what
was goin' on here,

246
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:06,500
he'd beat the crap out
of a legion of Flame Haze

247
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:07,833
to get back to her...!

248
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:10,583
But sometimes things
just don't work out, kid.

249
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:12,208
It's funny...

250
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:14,583
If he knew that Margery was
sleeping in his bed right now,

251
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:16,083
he would be back
here in a heartbeat.

252
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:17,583
Damn straight!

253
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,458
C'mon, man...

254
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:25,416
Hurry and get back here...

255
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,833
She needs you.

256
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:33,041
I knew it...

257
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:36,916
Hildegard cannot help us as
she's sided with Outlaw...

258
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,416
What now?

259
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,541
Personnel shortage.

260
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:43,458
Indeed, it seems
friendship among Flame Haze

261
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:45,750
is not enough to garner aid.

262
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:47,833
But the fault
lies with me...

263
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:49,875
I was foolish to think
they'd ever agree

264
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:53,583
to go along with
such a crazy plan.

265
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:57,125
Gavida, the Soaring
Tower of Quintessence...

266
00:17:57,208 --> 00:18:01,291
Creator of both Heaven's Road
and the Palace of the Stars...

267
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:04,916
Once warned that the two should
never come in close proximity.

268
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,916
Unfortunately, it would
appear that Gavida's words

269
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,833
are all I have
to rely on now.

270
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:13,125
I must leave soon
as my odds for victory

271
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:15,125
grow slimmer each day.

272
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:16,666
A solemn departure.

273
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:22,791
Indeed... If only
Margery Daw were well...

274
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:31,750
I can't seem to remember
where I put my bag.

275
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:33,166
It's on your back.

276
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:45,708
I wonder whether the baby
will be a boy or a girl.

277
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:49,041
Bel-Peol...

278
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:50,416
about the master...

279
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,666
I thought Stolas had
already covered that with you?

280
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,083
I assure you,

281
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:56,833
there is currently
nothing standing in the way

282
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:59,208
of the Grand Order.

283
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:00,708
"Currently"...?

284
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:03,791
You don't seem too sure
of the situation yourself.

285
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:06,708
I could always have Decarabia's
"friend" brought in...

286
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:08,625
to do some
investigating for us.

287
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:10,333
The Spiral Organ?

288
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:12,125
That might be a good idea.

289
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:14,125
There's no need to worry.

290
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:17,083
If the Mystes tries to
interfere with the Grand Order

291
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:19,458
I'm sure the master
will stop him.

292
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:21,291
However, I will say,

293
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:24,666
his lack of communication
makes me a little nervous.

294
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:27,291
I suppose it's out
of our hands... now.

295
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:30,666
I wonder...

296
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,541
What could possibly
cause the master

297
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:34,458
to miss our
strategy meetings?

298
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:37,875
I think I know where
you're going with this

299
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:41,166
and I assure you, Hecate
is not with the master...

300
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,916
There's no need
for you to worry.

301
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,333
Her only concern is
completion of the Grand Order.

302
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:50,458
She's calculating the final
coordinates as we speak.

303
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:51,833
That troublesome vessel

304
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:54,250
will not interfere
with our plans again.

305
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:59,000
I see the strategy
meeting ran long?

306
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:01,625
We're orchestrating what could
be the most significant war

307
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:03,125
in known history.

308
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:06,333
There are a million different
points for us to argue.

309
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:08,333
And since most of our
soldiers are veterans

310
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,708
with several hundred
years of combat experience,

311
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:12,541
it took quite a while.

312
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:14,208
Now that we've
agreed on a strategy

313
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:16,875
they'll have no problem
working together.

314
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:19,583
That is, as long as
Decarabia plays nice.

315
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:22,291
Does that mean all of the
preparations are now complete?

316
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:23,583
Indeed...

317
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:25,375
Connect us to the professor.

318
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:26,458
Yes.

319
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:33,916
Can you hear me, Domino?

320
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,750
Yes ma'am, loud and clear...!

321
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:37,666
The engine room is
at your service!

322
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,500
Do me a favor and
ask the professor

323
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:40,916
how much he has completed.

324
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,041
Yes, ma'am!

325
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:44,291
Professor! The
Strategist wants to know

326
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:46,375
how much you've complet...

327
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:48,583
This is no time to
start being lazy,

328
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:50,791
Domino, get back
to work right now!

329
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:53,416
The Strategist wanted
to ask you something!

330
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,625
Oh, is that so...?!

331
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:57,125
Ask away,
Bel-Peol, my dear!

332
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:58,333
But you'd better
make it quick

333
00:20:58,416 --> 00:20:59,583
because you know
better than anybody

334
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:01,125
how incredibly busy I am.

335
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:02,875
I've been working
to make sure

336
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:06,166
that the master's plan
is brilliantly executed!

337
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:09,708
Hecate is almost done
adjusting the final coordinates.

338
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:17,875
We'll be ready to activate the
Grand Order's second stage soon,

339
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:20,625
so we need you to
wrap things up.

340
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:22,625
Well then, I have
good news for you

341
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:24,958
because I finished all of
my second stage preparations

342
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:26,541
eons ago!

343
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:30,041
In fact, I've moved on to the
task of creating a failsafe

344
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:31,458
that will protect us in...

345
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:37,000
I have fulfilled the
promises made...

346
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:38,750
I do believe my
work is done.

347
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:41,791
If it's okay with you,

348
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:44,833
I'd like to return to my
post as your servant...

349
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:49,125
What do you say, my lovely
Supreme Throne, Hecate?

350
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:52,541
I asked that you stop
smoking yet you continue.

351
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:54,291
'Fraid so...

352
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:55,875
If you cannot do as I wish,

353
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:57,666
then you cannot be my servant.

354
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,625
Well, that's too bad.

355
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:02,708
In all seriousness,
it is not my decision.

356
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:06,166
It is good to have
you back, General.

357
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:11,708
Now, all that remains is to
bring about the Grand Order.

358
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:21,500
As I said before,

359
00:22:21,583 --> 00:22:24,541
there's no reason for
you to be worried, Syd.

360
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:27,041
What are you talking about?

361
00:22:27,125 --> 00:22:28,625
It's nothing, Priestess.

362
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:49,708
[Music]

363
00:24:14,708 --> 00:24:16,833
Sato finally
arrives in Tokyo...

364
00:24:16,916 --> 00:24:19,583
Where he gets a violent
welcome from Outlaw.

365
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:21,125
His world comes
crashing down

366
00:24:21,208 --> 00:24:23,666
when he learns about
what's happened in Misaki City.

367
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:26,166
Next time, on Shakugan
no Shana Final:

368
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:27,666
"In Your Hand."
