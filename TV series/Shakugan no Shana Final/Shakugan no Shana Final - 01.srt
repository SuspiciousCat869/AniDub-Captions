1
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:17,833
Yuji...

2
00:02:21,416 --> 00:02:23,041
Shana...

3
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:26,791
this is for the best I'm
changing your destiny.

4
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:32,750
Don't fight me.

5
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:39,375
It's what I decided
Christmas Eve.

6
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:52,583
Tomorrow, December the 24th,

7
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:55,208
at precisely nineteen
hundred hours,

8
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:56,875
come to the
Illumination Fiesta

9
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:58,875
being held at
the clock tower.

10
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:02,291
When you've made
your choice,

11
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:04,541
please meet one
of us there.

12
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:57,000
You asked me to choose...

13
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,541
And I did!

14
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:05,875
Yuji...

15
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:13,833
That night...

16
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:16,375
Yuji vanished
from Misaki City.

17
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:30,916
[Music]

18
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:43,458
[Music]

19
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:06,708
Hey Shana?

20
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:09,041
Isn't that
enough for today?

21
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:10,458
Yeah.

22
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:14,250
You know, as I was
watching you this morning...

23
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:16,041
I couldn't help but
wonder why you choose

24
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,458
to do all of your training
in our little yard.

25
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:21,041
You'd be better off
somewhere a bit more spacious,

26
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:22,666
wouldn't you?

27
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,250
What am I saying? !

28
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:27,125
Then you wouldn't have a
reason to come over each day.

29
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:29,500
I don't know what I'd do
without your visits;

30
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:30,916
I get so lonely.

31
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,458
You're not alone.

32
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:34,958
I guess you're right...

33
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:38,041
Once the baby's born it'll
be much livelier around here.

34
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:45,708
You should start getting
ready or else you'll be late...

35
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:47,916
That's no way to start
the new semester.

36
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:04,500
Here, let me get
that for you.

37
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,416
Now, it's time
for your bath!

38
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,666
Okay.

39
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,833
I noticed Yuji's
mug is gone.

40
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:31,916
It was his favorite...

41
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,208
He used it every
time we drank tea.

42
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:36,541
When a Torch disappears,

43
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:39,041
everything related to
the original human

44
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,750
ceases to exist.

45
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:43,666
Even their family's
memories of them disappear.

46
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:44,958
Unless, of course,

47
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:46,125
they happen to
have knowledge

48
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:47,875
of the Crimson World.

49
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:50,166
I'm aware of that.

50
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,708
Yuji doesn't live
here anymore...

51
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:08,083
Hey! I'm sorry!

52
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:14,458
It's hard to believe...

53
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:50,958
It's hard to believe...

54
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,708
Hi Kazumi...! Did you
have a good New Years?

55
00:08:57,791 --> 00:08:59,875
Jeez... where were you...?

56
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:03,041
I was gettin' lonely because
none of the gang's here.

57
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,375
The gang?

58
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:07,416
Yeah, Sato's absent, Shana
hasn't made it in yet,

59
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,166
and Ike's been at a student
council meeting all morning.

60
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,791
Oh, I see.

61
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:14,791
Oops! I almost
left somebody out!

62
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:16,500
How could I forget
about you...?!

63
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:18,583
I've missed ya!

64
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:22,083
Hey, you also forgot
your lover boy, Tanaka.

65
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:23,958
He can hear you, ya know!

66
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:25,583
Why're you always
trying to embarrass me? !

67
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,416
He's gone...

68
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,166
Nobody even
remembers Sakai.

69
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,791
Well, knock it off!

70
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:36,208
I asked you here...

71
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:38,583
To tell you
that I love you.

72
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:48,000
Happy New Year, Yoshida...
Good to see you.

73
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:51,250
Yeah the same to you... Ike.

74
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:52,708
You two- Hey!

75
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:54,583
Nakamura!

76
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:57,500
I brought this steamed
bun just for you! Try it!

77
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:59,041
Stuff the whole
thing in there!

78
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,458
Hi Shana...

79
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,416
Are you okay?

80
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:21,541
That night...

81
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:29,416
My heart broke...

82
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,583
I was sure Sakai had
chosen Shana over me.

83
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,291
Yuji's gone!

84
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:37,666
Back then...

85
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,166
I thought Sakai
was gone forever...

86
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,833
but now...

87
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:43,708
we have hope.

88
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:47,833
He may not be with us...

89
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,708
But we know...

90
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:51,250
Yuji is still alive.

91
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:58,583
Yuji Sakai...

92
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:01,166
What are you
thinking about?

93
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:02,416
The Flame Haze

94
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,125
and Crimson Denizens...

95
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:07,333
Why do they permeate
your thoughts?

96
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:09,250
There must be a way...

97
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:11,041
I'm afraid not...

98
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:13,125
When a Crimson
Denizen devours

99
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:15,666
a human's Power of Existence,

100
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,625
that destruction
of existence

101
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:21,083
creates a rift
within the world.

102
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:24,333
They know their actions
have dire consequences...

103
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:27,166
yet they continue to feed.

104
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,125
But isn't there some way?

105
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:30,666
There is not...

106
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,041
The tools known
as Flame Haze

107
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:34,958
were created to
protect the world

108
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:36,750
from Denizen attacks,

109
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:39,708
thereby preventing the
Great Disaster.

110
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:43,500
They are fighting a
never-ending battle.

111
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:45,166
They're tools...

112
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:46,791
in an endless war.

113
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:48,333
Precisely.

114
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:51,000
What should I do?

115
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:53,000
I don't know...

116
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:03,916
I knew that Mystes kid
was a troublemaker,

117
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,375
but I still can't believe he
vanished into thin air.

118
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:09,250
No joke...

119
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:12,166
We never even got
to say goodbye.

120
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,416
But the midget thinks
he's still alive...

121
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,833
We'll see 'bout that.

122
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:18,916
Sounds like a case of
denial, if you ask me.

123
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,541
Well, she seems
pretty sure of it.

124
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:24,125
I gotta admit, her
argument was convincing...

125
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:26,333
so much so that I even
agreed to help her beef up

126
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:28,291
her Unrestricted Spells.

127
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:30,458
Never thought
I'd see the day!

128
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:33,375
No offense, but you're
not the "teacher" type.

129
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:37,416
If I start out with a stiff
drink it should be easy.

130
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,750
Anyway, it seems
midget and company

131
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:43,833
are already worrying
about the next battle.

132
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:46,250
Against Bal Masque?

133
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:51,250
Yes unfortunately...

134
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:54,375
Wilhelmina suspects the
disappearance of Yuji...

135
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,625
and the random attacks
on Outlaw Posts

136
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:59,041
are all part of something
they're planning...

137
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:00,750
and I would have to agree.

138
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,125
Alastor's right
about this city...

139
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:06,916
it could be a
Maelstrom of Warfare.

140
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,875
You think it's attracting
misfortune...?

141
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:11,916
No wonder you and your big
butt brought us to this dump...!

142
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,625
You're drawn to trouble like a
moth to a flame, aren't ya?

143
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:18,291
Yeah... That's me...

144
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:20,875
I've got a
score to settle.

145
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:22,541
The demon I'm
hunting is trapped

146
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:25,458
in the Midnight Lost
Child within Yuji.

147
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,333
The Silver...

148
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:32,333
But I can't worry
about that now.

149
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:34,708
Our job is to
gather information.

150
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:37,833
Is that why you're
sending Keisaku to Outlaw?

151
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:39,000
You got it...

152
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:40,791
I was able to get
him a little job

153
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:42,708
working for them
as a messenger.

154
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:44,958
You sure that's
a good idea?

155
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:47,208
Don't worry, I'm
just testing him.

156
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:48,666
I need to make
sure he's capable

157
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,416
of following my directions.

158
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,583
Sometimes I think
he'd be better off

159
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:54,916
if he never got
mixed up with you.

160
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,083
But if he sticks
with me...

161
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:59,583
at least his survival
is guaranteed.

162
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:01,750
Bye...! See ya tomorrow!

163
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:03,250
Bye!

164
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,875
Ogata wanted to go by
Sato's and check on him...

165
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:11,291
but I couldn't bring
myself to do it...

166
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:14,083
I don't wanna risk
running into Margery.

167
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:16,333
I can't face her...

168
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,166
not after what happened...

169
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,916
I can't!

170
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,500
Yo.

171
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:24,541
Sato...! Why weren't
you at school today?

172
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:27,291
Sorry... I had some
things to get done...

173
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:28,583
I just finished
up so I thought

174
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:30,416
that I would come
by to see you.

175
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,833
Is there somethin' wrong?

176
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:34,583
I'm leaving for the
Tokyo Outlaw tomorrow.

177
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:36,208
To Outlaw?

178
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:38,416
You're gonna go work
for them after all? !

179
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,791
Yeah, as a messenger and
representative of Margery.

180
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:45,458
I think losing a friend was
the push I needed, you know?

181
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:48,291
You mean... Sakai?

182
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:51,000
Yeah... but Shana's convinced

183
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:53,000
he's still out
there somewhere...

184
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:55,000
and I think she
may be right...

185
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:58,083
so I'm determined to do
whatever I can to help.

186
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,625
I can't just sit
here and do nothin'.

187
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:01,875
It's funny...

188
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:03,458
Now that it's
actually happening

189
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:05,583
I'm startin' to get a
little nervous, man...

190
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:07,041
They don't trust newbs...

191
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:08,625
so instead of
the actual post,

192
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:11,333
it looks like I'll be
meeting them at an annex.

193
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:14,541
Margery says that I need
to go, to figure out

194
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:17,375
if this is what I really
wanna do with my life.

195
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:18,500
Yeah, I guess...

196
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:20,333
So... are you jealous?

197
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:23,083
It's cool, bro...

198
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:24,458
I'm glad you
feel that way.

199
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:25,708
Why?

200
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:27,375
Because if you didn't
feel anything...

201
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:30,250
it would mean that our
paths really had split.

202
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:31,541
Sato...

203
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:34,208
Listen... do me a
favor, will ya...?

204
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:36,500
Look after Margery
while I'm gone.

205
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:38,125
Every once in a while,

206
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:39,333
she needs someone
to go scrape her

207
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:41,291
off the floor of the bar.

208
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,083
But Sato!

209
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,666
I can't...

210
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:55,333
It appears we were
right, indeed.

211
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:58,333
Reports are now coming in
from all over the globe.

212
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:00,541
Danger foreseen.

213
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:04,583
There is no question that
Bal Masque was somehow

214
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:06,208
involved with the
disappearance

215
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,958
of the Midnight Lost
Child's Mystes.

216
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:13,333
This, in addition to their
brutal attacks on Outlaw,

217
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:17,000
indeed leads me to believe
they are plotting something.

218
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:18,541
Now headquarters...

219
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:21,208
appears to have reached
that conclusion as well.

220
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:22,583
Took long enough.

221
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,958
Better late than never.

222
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:26,875
Bal Masque has never
used a direct attack

223
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:28,833
like this before...

224
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:31,958
What would cause them
to start now...? ...

225
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:35,083
And why would they...
abduct the Mystes?

226
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:36,833
Crucial object.

227
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:39,416
That would indeed explain
Bal Masque's obsession

228
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,208
with the Midnight
Lost Child as of late.

229
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:47,291
The mistress shows no signs of
waver despite it all...

230
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:49,458
Well-being assured.

231
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:53,375
I can tell she's merely hiding
her feelings of unease...

232
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:55,458
I wish there was
something I could do.

233
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:02,875
Hey, I'm home.

234
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:04,708
Welcome back, milady.

235
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:08,375
Please brief
me on your day.

236
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:10,666
Well, they've
forgotten him...

237
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,041
just like all the
other Torches...

238
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,500
Any changes to the letter?

239
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:15,875
No.

240
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,416
Was there any new
information on Bal Masque

241
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,583
in today's reports?

242
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:23,250
Unfortunately...

243
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:25,000
they focused on
the Outlaw attacks

244
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:27,208
and didn't make mention of
the Midnight Lost Child

245
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:28,833
or its whereabouts...

246
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:32,125
but I will continue to
search them for you... milady.

247
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:33,583
Thanks.

248
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,166
Sophie Sawallisch...

249
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:41,333
You should write her a letter
containing your own report.

250
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,958
The Braider of
Trembling Might

251
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:47,333
is the provisional
leader of Outlaw.

252
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:49,750
Surely she's aware
of the matter.

253
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:52,333
Then write to
her directly.

254
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:54,083
Sophie?

255
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:56,833
'Kay!

256
00:18:58,458 --> 00:18:59,958
She will advise.

257
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:03,250
Indeed, the mistress can speak
openly about her feelings

258
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:06,083
with the Braider
of Trembling Might...

259
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:08,666
Since she is unable
to share them with me.

260
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:13,083
I don't know
where to start.

261
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:23,208
I realize it's
nothing more...

262
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:25,750
than a returned letter...

263
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,333
But for me...

264
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:31,916
And Kazumi...

265
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:36,208
It's also a sign of hope.

266
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:38,875
I remember that night...

267
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,625
Yuji...

268
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:52,333
I'll tell her
what happened...

269
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:55,166
Each and every detail
stored in my memory.

270
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:58,916
I'll tell her
that the Mystes...

271
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,041
That Yuji...

272
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:05,125
Is still alive.

273
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:09,791
Are your thoughts
wandering again,

274
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,708
Yuji Sakai?

275
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:13,416
Yeah...

276
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,083
I don't know...

277
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:16,875
what I should do.

278
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:19,125
What is your wish?

279
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:20,958
My wish?

280
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:24,625
Isn't there anything
that you desire?

281
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:29,000
Yes...

282
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:51,000
She's using her flame...

283
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:54,750
to create a physical
manifestation of her power...

284
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:57,041
that can be wielded
like a weapon!

285
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,125
You're making good
progress, midget.

286
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:29,458
Maybe next time you'll
be able to attack

287
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:31,666
without thinkin'
about it first!

288
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,375
I'm not ready...

289
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:34,833
I've gotta learn how
to stabilize it

290
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:37,833
so it'll keep its size no
matter how hard I swing.

291
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:44,208
I wanna be able to control
it properly at its full size...

292
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:47,458
but right now I can
only handle it at half.

293
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:50,041
Don't you think
that's good enough?

294
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:51,416
No...

295
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,500
I need to become
stronger...

296
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:56,000
so I'm prepared to
face any challenge.

297
00:21:57,458 --> 00:21:58,916
Yes...

298
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,833
any challenge at all.

299
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:03,291
This letter...

300
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:06,333
is the one thing
that gives me hope.

301
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:08,666
Yuji's still alive.

302
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,208
Are you sure?

303
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:11,583
I'm positive...

304
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:14,916
otherwise these letters
would've disappeared...

305
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,791
instead... they
came back to us.

306
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:19,916
Who do you
think sent them?

307
00:22:22,791 --> 00:22:24,541
I don't have a clue...

308
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:27,750
Who cares...? As long as
these letters exist...

309
00:22:27,833 --> 00:22:29,583
then we still have hope.

310
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:33,666
Yuji's still alive...

311
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,291
I just know it!

312
00:22:40,541 --> 00:22:42,666
I wanna believe...

313
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:45,625
that what Shana
told me is true...

314
00:22:45,708 --> 00:22:47,583
So please...

315
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:49,333
Don't let me down...

316
00:22:49,416 --> 00:22:51,583
That's all I ask of you...

317
00:22:51,666 --> 00:22:53,000
Sakai!

318
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:56,458
No matter what happens...

319
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,708
my feelings
won't change...

320
00:22:58,791 --> 00:23:00,375
Yuji!

321
00:23:03,583 --> 00:23:06,666
Have you made
your decision?

322
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:08,458
Yes...

323
00:23:08,541 --> 00:23:10,208
I want to free her!

324
00:23:12,166 --> 00:23:15,750
If that is what you
wish, Yuji Sakai...

325
00:23:15,833 --> 00:23:17,875
Then you will be
the sole human...

326
00:23:17,958 --> 00:23:20,750
to ever walk alongside me.

327
00:23:54,291 --> 00:23:55,458
Please master...

328
00:23:55,541 --> 00:23:57,458
give us your orders.

329
00:23:57,541 --> 00:24:00,500
Prepare the Palace
of the Stars...

330

Shana continues
her training,

unaware that I've become
the leader of Bal Masque.
