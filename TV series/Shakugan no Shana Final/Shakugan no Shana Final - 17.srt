1
00:00:52,875 --> 00:00:54,333
We now have
further details

2
00:00:54,416 --> 00:00:55,958
on the suspected
acts of terrorism

3
00:00:56,041 --> 00:00:58,416
that simultaneously struck
countless airports

4
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,583
throughout Japan
early this morning.

5
00:00:59,666 --> 00:01:01,750
I thought it couldn't
get any worse.

6
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:04,375
Now innocent people
have been hurt.

7
00:01:04,458 --> 00:01:06,166
The Denizens are
swarming to Japan

8
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:08,541
'cause that's where Xanadu's
gonna be created.

9
00:01:08,625 --> 00:01:10,250
And the Flame Haze aren't
gonna let 'em go anywhere

10
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:11,750
without a fight.

11
00:01:11,833 --> 00:01:14,500
It just sucks that humans were
caught in the crossfire.

12
00:01:14,583 --> 00:01:16,250
Just because the Denizens
have been ordered

13
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:17,791
not to devour human souls,

14
00:01:17,875 --> 00:01:19,583
doesn't mean they're going
to behave themselves.

15
00:01:26,875 --> 00:01:32,583
[Music]

16
00:02:57,875 --> 00:02:59,791
I was led to believe the
Flame Haze are responsible

17
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:01,750
for maintaining the
Earth's balance.

18
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:03,750
Obviously, that
is not the case!

19
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:05,333
At least the Crimson Denizens

20
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:07,375
know when to put
away their swords.

21
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:08,791
That's ridiculous!

22
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:10,833
We were outnumbered but
we did the best we could.

23
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:12,625
You do realize the only
reason you're alive

24
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:14,083
is because of us, right?

25
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:16,000
I don't see you putting
your lives on the line.

26
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:18,166
Don't act as though we
humans owe you anything.

27
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,041
While we appreciate the
attempt to protect us,

28
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:22,833
we cannot simply overlook
such a heinous oversight.

29
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:24,208
You knew you
were outnumbered.

30
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:26,458
Yes, but we fought anyway,
for your sake!

31
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:28,000
I knew this meeting
would be tense

32
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:29,833
but it's worse
than I thought.

33
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:31,500
This venue was a mistake.

34
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:34,208
It would help if we were
able to speak face-to-face.

35
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:36,583
They've been seduced
by a coward's peace

36
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:38,500
and lost to the
madness of terror.

37
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:41,458
In all honesty, I expected
as much from the humans.

38
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:45,916
The God of Creation could
strike at any moment.

39
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,833
We should be preparing
for his next move;

40
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:50,375
not sitting in a dusty, old
hall arguing about a battle

41
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:52,041
that's already been lost.

42
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,875
Once they've had the opportunity
to speak their minds,

43
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:58,833
I'm sure they will
return all power

44
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:00,875
to our fearless leader.

45
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:04,083
This loss was our fault
as much as it was hers.

46
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:07,291
She alone cannot be
held accountable.

47
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:08,708
What a travesty.

48
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:10,250
Their bickering
is an insult to

49
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,166
the troops who gave
their lives fighting.

50
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,416
For now, all we can
do is wait patiently

51
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,541
until they eventually
run out of hot air.

52
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:18,166
Yes, please enlighten us.

53
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,083
We have to come to an
agreement of some sort.

54
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:34,208
So the humans are
pissed at Outlaw?

55
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:36,458
They never cared
what we did before.

56
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:39,416
I guess there's a first
time for everything.

57
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,375
Well, we did just
get our asses kicked

58
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:43,333
so I can't blame 'em
for being on edge.

59
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:45,666
Besides, they're good and
drunk on the "Xanadu" wine

60
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,500
the kid's been pouring
down their throats.

61
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:51,083
And I'm bettin' they're gonna
stay that way for a while.

62
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,250
Yuji Sakai.

63
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:55,708
In all of history,

64
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:57,583
I don't think there's ever
been anyone more deserving

65
00:04:57,666 --> 00:05:00,458
of the title of
"evil genius".

66
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:02,041
They say when a man's
character isn't clear

67
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:03,666
you should look
to his friends.

68
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,041
Wonder what that
says about you?

69
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:07,500
Okay, it's open.

70
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:10,833
Far as I can tell,

71
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:12,916
there look to be eighty-two
different layers.

72
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,500
This is amazing.

73
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:18,000
Each spell is constructed
with unimaginable precision.

74
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:20,166
Thank goodness for the
Scroll of Secrets;

75
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:23,000
it would take me decades to
analyze this thing without it.

76
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,916
Hey, Shana?

77
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,541
Is this the first time
you've ever visited New York?

78
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:39,625
Yeah.

79
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:41,375
I've been to America before

80
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:42,666
but never to one
of the cities

81
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,208
where the Gods of
the Earth live.

82
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:51,916
I can't get her to
come out of her shell.

83
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,041
I didn't think she
was the shy type

84
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:55,708
but it sure seems that way.

85
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:04,458
That's yummy!

86
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:06,083
Finally, a sign of life!

87
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:07,333
My goodness!

88
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:08,916
All it takes is a
single raspberry

89
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
and all of a sudden
she's adorable!

90
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:12,166
No joke!

91
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,791
She looks like the
contractor of an angel

92
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:16,541
not the God of Atonement.

93
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:18,500
Would you like to
try a blueberry?

94
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:20,208
Or maybe some pineapple?

95
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:24,666
Thanks, Chiara.

96
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,708
Now she's being friendly.

97
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:28,583
She was just nervous,
that's all.

98
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:30,916
I guess it's
understandable.

99
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,916
I mean, it's gotta be
pretty tough knowing

100
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,291
that the fate of the
world is in your hands.

101
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,375
It's about time;

102
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:42,333
I thought their flight
would never come in.

103
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:44,416
Let's find 'em.

104
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,375
Are you sure you're going
to be all right, miss?

105
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:48,000
Try to cheer up, okay?

106
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:49,833
Thank you for
being so kind.

107
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:51,375
This journey would've
been unbearable

108
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:52,583
were it not for you,
my friends.

109
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:54,250
It was no big
deal, really.

110
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:55,750
Here, use this to
dry your tears.

111
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:57,625
All right, all right,
let's break it up.

112
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:58,708
Show's over, people.

113
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:00,416
Time for you to
get a move on.

114
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,041
-Goodbye.
-Take care of yourself.

115
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:05,666
Ladies.

116
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,333
We meet again
Archer of Aurora!

117
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:09,250
You're just as
lovely as ever.

118
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:12,458
Thanks. It's nice to see
the two of you again.

119
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:14,291
I don't believe that
I've had the pleasure

120
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:16,083
of making your
acquaintance, miss.

121
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:17,708
You can call me Southvalley.

122
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:19,500
I'm the Evoker
of Demon Horde,

123
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:22,041
known as He Who Shows
the Path of the Dead.

124
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:24,875
And I am the humble
priest of Tezcatlipoca,

125
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:26,791
the Pipe of
Hesitation and Fear.

126
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:28,208
My name is...

127
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:30,000
It's you!

128
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:32,416
You are the child who has
been entrusted with the future

129
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,958
by the Drum of
Exceptional Love

130
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:35,666
and He Who Walks with Rain.

131
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,916
I am the priestess
of Chalciuhtlicue,

132
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,750
who is known as the Bell
of Cleansing Flutter.

133
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:43,208
I am called the Whirler
of Mighty Waves.

134
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:45,791
She Who Dances Before
the Surging Sea,

135
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:48,250
but please feel free
to call me Westshore.

136
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:49,583
Deity of providence,

137
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:52,041
avatar of judgment
and condemnation.

138
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:53,666
Great Flame of Heaven.

139
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:56,000
It is truly an honor
to finally meet you.

140
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:58,125
No, the honor is mine.

141
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:01,041
We appreciate you coming
here on such short notice.

142
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:02,583
However...

143
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:06,041
It's not been decided I will
be entrusted with the future,

144
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:07,041
not yet.

145
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,750
Thanks to the Beckoner
of Brightened Dew

146
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:13,541
and the Drum of
Exceptional Love,

147
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:16,791
twenty percent of the Flame Haze
Army survived our defeat.

148
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:18,291
I'd like to show
my gratitude

149
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:20,083
and fulfill the covenant
I made with them,

150
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:23,041
by striking at the heart of
the enemy's forces myself.

151
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:24,500
That said,

152
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:27,125
while the plan I've devised
is based on strategy,

153
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:30,416
it also incorporates my
personal feelings as well.

154
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,000
I realize that it may go
against your principles,

155
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:35,666
however, as the Flaming-Haired
Blazing-Eyed Hunter,

156
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:38,041
I feel it is our best
course of action.

157
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:40,708
If after hearing this, you
still want to join our fight,

158
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:43,333
I'd be more than happy to
share the details with you.

159
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:46,000
But if you choose not to,

160
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:48,416
then from this day forward,
we'll never bother you again.

161
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:54,833
I'm sorry.

162
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:56,708
I hate to laugh but I
don't think you know

163
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:58,583
who you're dealing
with, miss.

164
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:00,125
You see, the Four
Gods of the Earth

165
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:02,583
aren't nearly as
concerned with "the rules"

166
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:05,541
as the rest of
you Flame Haze.

167
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:08,458
So there's no need to talk
about the great task with us.

168
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:11,125
The regulations of
others do not sway us.

169
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:12,708
Even amidst this chaos,

170
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:14,666
we'll choose which
path we follow.

171
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,750
In fact, the feelings you
see as a disadvantage

172
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:18,291
may be the
deciding factor in

173
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:20,916
whether we choose
to join your fight.

174
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,375
Since ancient times,

175
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:25,208
the interaction between
Crimson Denizens and humanity,

176
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:27,958
has been part of the
natural order of this world.

177
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:30,333
We fear the God of
Creation's recent exploits

178
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:31,958
may jeopardize that order.

179
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:34,833
And now we realize
that it is time for us

180
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:36,666
to take a stand against him.

181
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,416
We cannot stand by while
he manipulates this world.

182
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,458
He must be stopped.

183
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:43,916
If the God of Creation
creates Xanadu

184
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,750
and leaves with all of
the Crimson Denizens,

185
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:48,041
the Power of Existence
they currently hold,

186
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:49,666
would come rushing
back to the Earth,

187
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:52,750
making it incredibly unstable
for a long time to come.

188
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:54,125
It's highly likely

189
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:55,625
they're just going to
do what they did here

190
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:58,166
but to an even
greater capacity.

191
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,500
They won't have any reason to
hold back in the new world.

192
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:02,791
The Crimson Denizens
will have free rein there

193
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:05,041
because it was created
specifically for them.

194
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:06,625
We know what
we must do now.

195
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:08,916
There is only one way we
can protect the Earth

196
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,791
and its innocent people from
the impending disaster,

197
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:14,208
and that is to prevent the
creation of the Xanadu.

198
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:23,000
You've got a message for us,
so let's hear it.

199
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:25,416
Share with us the words
entrusted to you

200
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,500
by the Drum of Exceptional Love
and He Who Walks With Rain.

201
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:35,083
"I have become
a drop of rain.

202
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:38,791
I sacrificed myself hoping
it would force you to act."

203
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:40,750
"Please believe
me when I say."

204
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:45,083
"Joining the Flame Haze
in their fight is,

205
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:47,708
without doubt, the
right choice to make."

206
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:53,375
Very well.

207
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:55,291
The decision has been made.

208
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:58,125
And, who made the
choice to fight?

209
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:02,875
Just say the word,
and we'll be there.

210
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:06,291
I'll explain our
plan of attack.

211
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:11,583
Um, excuse me.

212
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,833
Thanks for inviting us.

213
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:23,333
If there's anything
we can help with,

214
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:24,625
call us and we'll
be right over.

215
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:25,666
Thank you, kids.

216
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,125
But you've got
better things to do

217
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:29,250
than hang out with
old fogies like us.

218
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:31,041
Please be careful on
your way home, okay?

219
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:33,166
-We will!
-Thanks again for the meal!

220
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,875
So, I guess we'll see ya.

221
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:36,333
Take care of yourselves.

222
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:37,500
Goodbye.

223
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:38,833
See ya soon!

224
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,541
Jeez. I thought Tanaka
was a gentleman.

225
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:55,916
Why isn't he
walking you home?

226
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,291
It's not a big deal.

227
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:59,125
I'm too busy to
hang out anyway.

228
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:10,875
You're just
gonna let 'em go?

229
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:12,083
Yeah.

230
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:14,625
I think that's what's
best for everybody.

231
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:16,291
You realize they're
gonna get wrapped up

232
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:18,375
in this mess eventually.

233
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:19,416
You shouldn't worry.

234
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,708
Sakai.

235
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:24,708
Um?

236
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:26,916
What is it?

237
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,458
You wanna go by your
parent's house and say hi?

238
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:31,125
Your dad's
there right now.

239
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,291
You could just say that
you're a friend of ours.

240
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:35,041
Even if they don't
remember who you are

241
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:36,500
at least you'd get
to see them again.

242
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:37,666
No, thanks.

243
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:40,041
I'm sorry but I
can't do that.

244
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,875
What is with you?

245
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:45,416
If you don't wanna
see your folks

246
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,916
then why the hell
are you here?

247
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,458
I thought Sato would've
told you by now.

248
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:52,291
I'm creating a
paradise for Denizens.

249
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:55,375
He told us about Xanadu.

250
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:59,875
Well, I want to do it here,
in Misaki City.

251
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:02,583
Do you remember what
I told you, Yoshida?

252
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:03,791
The last time
we met I said,

253
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:06,500
"I haven't changed
anything yet."

254
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:10,416
However, since that time,
I've changed many things.

255
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,333
Now that all of the other
preparations are complete,

256
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:15,041
there is only one
more thing I need.

257
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:16,750
And that is your help.

258
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,291
No way! As if it weren't bad
enough that you took Shana,

259
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:23,416
now you wanna
take Yoshida, too?

260
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,041
Miss Yoshida's cooperation
is absolutely imperative

261
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:28,541
to Yuji Sakai's plan.

262
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:30,041
But.

263
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:32,833
Perhaps you're right,
this is rather sudden.

264
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:36,958
I'll give her time
to think it over.

265
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:39,916
How about we go for a
walk in the meantime?

266
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,583
I know it's kind of cold.

267
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:44,458
And you're not gonna snatch
her like you did Shana?

268
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:48,041
No. This is your opportunity
to ask me anything at all.

269
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:49,916
I'll tell you whatever
you want to know.

270
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,416
I've got time to spare

271
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,625
and I'd like to hear
what you have to say.

272
00:13:57,708 --> 00:14:01,208
All right, what happened to that
Snake of the Festival jerk?

273
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:03,875
He's still here, within me.

274
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:05,666
So how much of
you is Sakai

275
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,541
and how much is
the creepy dude?

276
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:09,375
I'd prefer you call him
the God of Creation

277
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:10,875
or Snake of the Festival.

278
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:13,000
He's a noble being who
deserves your respect.

279
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:17,500
I guess you could
say we've merged.

280
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:18,625
The Snake of the Festival

281
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:21,041
is focused on his
purpose for existence.

282
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:23,333
He has no interest in
interfering with my plans

283
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:25,666
or anyone else's
for that matter.

284
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,666
I trust him because he
had the opportunity

285
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,250
to completely take
over my existence,

286
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:31,041
but he chose not to.

287
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:33,250
Are you trying to tell me
that the guy's not a creep?

288
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:34,791
'Cause from what I saw,

289
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:37,208
he's an arrogant jerk
with a big mouth.

290
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:38,666
That's not true.

291
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,000
He simply wants
to grant a wish

292
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:43,291
that he couldn't
thousands of years ago.

293
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:44,875
Is that so wrong?

294
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:47,333
You misconstrued his
fervor for arrogance.

295
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:50,375
He's not a maniacal leader
but a compassionate one.

296
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:52,916
He's just more vocal than
other gods like Alastor.

297
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,541
Wait a minute.

298
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:57,166
You're not gonna fight against
him and Shana, are you?

299
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:58,958
I'm afraid I
have no choice.

300
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:00,750
-There's gotta be another way!
-No.

301
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,416
It's inevitable.

302
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,958
But why?
Is it for her sake?

303
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:08,000
Not just for hers,
but for everyone's sake.

304
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:10,208
You seriously think that
you're doing the right thing?

305
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:11,541
Yes, that is
what I believe;

306
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:13,250
whether you agree or not.

307
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:16,208
C'mon, Sakai, just think about
what you're doing to Shana!

308
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:18,416
I understand that it's
difficult for you to see things

309
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,625
from my perspective.

310
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:21,000
'Cause it's messed up!

311
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:23,250
And now you wanna get
Yoshida involved, too?

312
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:31,333
You really can't
do this without me?

313
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:37,541
No.

314
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:39,583
I need your help Yoshida.

315
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:46,208
If that's the case,

316
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:47,125
then I'll go with you.

317
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:48,583
Don't do it!

318
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:51,000
It's okay.
I'm gonna be fine.

319
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:54,541
I just know there's no way
I'll be able to refuse him.

320
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:57,000
I'll go as long
as you can assure me

321
00:15:57,083 --> 00:16:00,791
that I'll be helping
Sakai with his plan.

322
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:01,958
Yes.

323
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:03,875
You will be there
solely to help me.

324
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:08,750
I don't see Ogata.

325
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:10,916
Why hasn't she made
it to practice yet?

326
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,333
She said she
was gonna skip

327
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:13,750
because she had
something important to do

328
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:15,791
later this afternoon.

329
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:16,958
That's why she
was able to go

330
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:19,125
to your dad's
welcome home party.

331
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:21,083
I see.

332
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:23,625
Are you gonna turn the school
into a battlefield again?

333
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:28,083
Like during the
Autumn Festival?

334
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:30,166
I don't think
you understand.

335
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,708
It's much bigger
than that.

336
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:38,416
It all started
here at Managawa.

337
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,625
It's where I met Hirai

338
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,250
who's soul was
later devoured.

339
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:47,416
But this time it won't
be just the school.

340
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,750
All of Misaki City will
become a battlefield.

341
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:52,958
What the hell's
gotten into you?

342
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:54,791
What'll happen
to everyone here?

343
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:05,041
I've taken every
necessary precaution

344
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:07,708
to protect innocent civilians
from the fighting.

345
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:09,250
Believe me, if I thought
that their lives

346
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:10,833
were going to be at risk.

347
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:12,333
I never would have
let Ike and Ogata

348
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:15,666
go home this afternoon.

349
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,458
I'm prepared to
protect Misaki City

350
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:19,083
and all of its residents.

351
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:20,333
The Denizens
have been ordered

352
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:22,458
not to devour
human souls in Japan

353
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,000
and it's being
upheld so far.

354
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:29,041
But... I can't guarantee
the human's safety for long

355
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:32,375
'cause the order was given
by the God of Creation,

356
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:34,291
the Snake
of the Festival.

357
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:37,791
A god who is known to
affirm all desires.

358
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:40,041
I think it's fair to say
he's underestimated

359
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,833
by the very
Denizens he serves.

360
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:44,791
He is an optimistic god,

361
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:47,041
which has lead his
followers to believe

362
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:50,916
that he will forgive
them for any wrongdoing.

363
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,416
I'll admit I was
skeptical at first.

364
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,458
I couldn't imagine
the Crimson Denizens

365
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:58,625
would ever agree to adhere
to his injunction.

366
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:00,666
But so far, so good.

367
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:10,791
Ever since we first
mentioned paradise to them,

368
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:13,333
they've been on
their best behavior.

369
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:16,541
Call it a reward, or bait,

370
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:19,583
either way, it calmed
them down for now.

371
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:22,416
Honestly, I have no
idea what'll happen

372
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,750
when Xanadu's born.

373
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:25,750
Until then,
all I can do

374
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:29,416
is observe them and
kill any who disobey.

375
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,291
I hate that it has
to come to that

376
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:33,875
but I have to keep them in
check one way or another.

377
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:38,958
Yuji Sakai will be the one

378
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:40,958
who finally grants
the Denizens' wish

379
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:43,000
but I must be
strict with them.

380
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:44,958
Not only to protect
what is here now,

381
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,958
but also what is to come.

382
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:48,833
I have a difficult
job ahead of me.

383
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:52,708
I have to be a
tightrope walker.

384
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:55,083
I must balance between
the small gears

385
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:57,416
of the giant
machine known as

386
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,583
the creation of
paradise, Xanadu.

387
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:01,958
And I'm limited by
the current state

388
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:03,875
of the Snake of
the Festival's body.

389
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:11,000
I get it now.

390
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,916
Just like me, Sakai's
finally figured out

391
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,958
that he's powerless

392
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:18,125
but he's decided to
keep fighting anyway.

393
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:20,500
He's just trying to
accomplish a goal.

394
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:26,125
In a way, he's no
different from Shana

395
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:29,208
who's trying to accomplish
her own goal right now.

396
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:31,458
In the end, both of 'em
are just trying to stand up

397
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:35,000
for what they believe in.

398
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:38,125
I bet that's why Yoshida
agreed to go with him,

399
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:40,625
'cause she wants to stand
up for her beliefs as well.

400
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:47,625
Long ago, the
God of Creation,

401
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:48,875
the Snake of the Festival,

402
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:50,708
wanted to create
a walled garden

403
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:53,166
that would house all the
Denizens in this world.

404
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,666
But he was banished to the
Abyss before it came to be.

405
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:59,291
Now, thousands
of years later,

406
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:02,708
the Crimson Denizens have
a new wish for their god.

407
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:04,500
They want a world
just like this one

408
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:05,583
that they can
call their own.

409
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:08,541
To grant their wish,

410
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:11,000
the God of Creation has decided
to make an identical world

411
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:13,541
within the Abyss itself.

412
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:16,000
A place where his followers
will be allowed to roam free

413
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:18,166
without being hunted.

414
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:21,916
A parallel world,
if you will.

415
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,666
It'll be identical to
this one in every way?

416
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:27,000
But how's that
even possible?

417
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:29,625
I mean, I thought the
rift was a volatile place;

418
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:32,208
filled with crazy
storms and stuff.

419
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:34,791
It's possible.

420
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:38,000
Time and distance are
completely meaningless there.

421
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:40,583
I could create
a whole universe

422
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:44,333
and it wouldn't have any
effect on it whatsoever.

423
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:47,625
The chaos there has
nothing to do with creation.

424
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:49,750
The Denizens
have requested

425
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:51,666
that their paradise
be full of life;

426
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,416
they want it to be
a perfect reflection

427
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,833
of the world
they live in now.

428
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:57,625
They don't want
an empty playground

429
00:20:57,708 --> 00:20:59,875
with no one to interact
with but themselves.

430
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:01,291
They want a world

431
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:03,000
where they can continue
to live amongst the humans

432
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:05,500
as they have been
all this time.

433
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:07,458
When the Denizens first
came to this world,

434
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:09,708
they were fascinated by it.

435
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:11,750
More than anything, they
wanted to peacefully coexist

436
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:13,083
with the humans.

437
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:16,083
I'm creating Xanadu to
give them a second chance.

438
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:17,541
Once we leave this place,

439
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:19,291
you will never have to
worry about another soul

440
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:22,833
being devoured again.

441
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:24,458
It won't be long

442
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:26,958
before Shana and the
others try to stop me.

443
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:31,291
But there is no stopping me.

444
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:33,375
I'm prepared to do
whatever I must

445
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,416
to make Xanadu a reality.

446
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,750
Hey Sakai.

447
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:38,375
I don't understand why
you haven't told Shana

448
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:39,625
what you're telling us now!

449
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:42,041
-I think she should know!
-I can't.

450
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:43,833
Why can't you?

451
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:45,583
I know her well.

452
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:47,791
There's no way
she would ever agree

453
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:51,833
to take part in a vague,
optimistic plan like mine.

454
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:53,541
I am willing to
explain my reasoning

455
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:56,250
to any Flame Haze who
would care to listen

456
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:59,250
but I know it won't
sway their opinion.

457
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:01,500
Their unwillingness to
discuss the matter leaves me

458
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:03,500
with no other choice.

459
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:05,375
We'll have to go to war.

460
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:09,541
You're gonna fight Shana?

461
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:12,000
Has Sato been in
contact with you?

462
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:15,541
Shana and the others should
be here in just a few hours.

463
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:18,083
I would suggest that
you don't stick around.

464
00:22:19,791 --> 00:22:21,583
You don't have
to tell me twice!

465
00:22:21,666 --> 00:22:23,833
I'm gonna tell
Sato everything

466
00:22:23,916 --> 00:22:24,958
then I'm gonna
ditch this bookmark,

467
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:27,500
head home, eat dinner,
and hit the sack!

468
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:30,833
It's in your
hands now, Sakai.

469
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:33,625
Promise me you're gonna do
what you can to protect us!

470
00:22:33,708 --> 00:22:36,333
Everybody's counting on you!

471
00:22:36,416 --> 00:22:38,000
I promise.

472
00:22:38,083 --> 00:22:40,541
Yoshida, are you
sure you wanna go?

473
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:41,666
Yeah.

474
00:22:42,958 --> 00:22:44,458
I guess this is goodbye.

475
00:22:44,541 --> 00:22:46,166
Listen, Sakai.

476
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:48,291
I know we haven't really
known each other that long

477
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:51,833
but it's been one
hell of a ride, man!

478
00:22:51,916 --> 00:22:53,083
Yeah.

479
00:22:53,166 --> 00:22:54,708
As a matter of fact,

480
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:57,333
it almost feels like
it was all a dream.

481
00:22:57,416 --> 00:22:59,250
I gotta be honest.

482
00:22:59,333 --> 00:23:00,916
I wanted to punch you
when I first saw you

483
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,208
but we're cool now.

484
00:23:08,666 --> 00:23:09,791
Thanks, Tanaka.

485
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:13,833
I'll see ya.

486
00:23:20,291 --> 00:23:22,458
Well, I'm ready
to go if you are.

487
00:23:22,541 --> 00:23:23,625
You're positive?

488
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:29,291
In the beginning,
I wasn't so sure

489
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:30,583
'cause I was scared.

490
00:23:30,666 --> 00:23:32,500
But now that I
know the real Sakai

491
00:23:32,583 --> 00:23:34,291
is still in
there somewhere,

492
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:36,666
I'm happy to do whatever
I can to help you.

493
00:23:41,958 --> 00:23:45,083
I know it's a lot to take
in but I assure you,

494
00:23:45,166 --> 00:23:47,125
I'm doing what's
best for the world.

495
00:24:20,875 --> 00:24:22,916
Upon her arrival at the
Palace of the Stars,

496
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,750
Yoshida is told her role
in the creation of Xanadu.

497
00:24:25,833 --> 00:24:27,166
Under the protection
of Bal Masque,

498
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:29,750
Denizens swarm Misaki City
as Yuji and Shana

499
00:24:29,833 --> 00:24:31,125
begin their final battle.

500
00:24:31,208 --> 00:24:33,333
Next time, on Shakugan
no Shana Final:

501
00:24:33,416 --> 00:24:34,666
"Spiral of Conflict."
