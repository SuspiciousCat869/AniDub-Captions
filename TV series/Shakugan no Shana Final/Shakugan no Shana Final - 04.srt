1
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:01,583
I have come back for you...

2
00:01:04,708 --> 00:01:05,666
Shana.

3
00:01:09,125 --> 00:01:10,458
Yuji.

4
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:25,958
Is that really...

5
00:01:26,041 --> 00:01:27,333
Sakai?

6
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:36,708
Who are you?

7
00:01:36,791 --> 00:01:39,583
How sad that you do
not recognize me...

8
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:41,083
Flame of Heaven.

9
00:01:41,166 --> 00:01:43,000
Should I?

10
00:01:43,083 --> 00:01:44,416
No...

11
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,333
I suppose it makes sense.

12
00:01:46,416 --> 00:01:50,125
After all, you came to
this world after I did.

13
00:01:50,208 --> 00:01:53,166
Therefore, you've never
heard the sound of my voice

14
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,750
nor the words
I've spoken directly.

15
00:01:55,833 --> 00:01:58,041
Again. Who are you?!

16
00:01:58,125 --> 00:01:59,375
I suspect...

17
00:01:59,458 --> 00:02:02,500
This is another ploy by
that three-eyed harpy...

18
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:04,875
A Trojan horse
for the Silver.

19
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,291
We're gonna
wrangle you up

20
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:08,375
and force ya to
tell us everything!

21
00:02:09,708 --> 00:02:11,750
Brainwashed, perhaps...?

22
00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:14,333
Or, rather, it would seem...

23
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:17,250
That he has indeed
been possessed.

24
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:19,791
He let his guard down.

25
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:21,541
I'm sorry, but
you're both wrong...

26
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:23,041
Wilhelmina...

27
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:24,500
Margery.

28
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:27,000
Yeah...? Well,
I don't buy it.

29
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:28,750
Then you truly are...

30
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:30,666
Yuji Sakai.

31
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,875
Yes... the one and only.

32
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:35,500
Of course...

33
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:38,500
that's just the name
I use in this world.

34
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:40,375
I have a true
name as well.

35
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:41,375
A true name?

36
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:42,791
The hell's that mean?

37
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:45,041
Who else are you?

38
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:47,833
Perhaps this will
help you understand...

39
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:49,791
I'll show you my flame.

40
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:56,625
Cast a Seal.

41
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:21,291
A black flame...

42
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:22,458
That's right...

43
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:24,083
This is my flame's color...

44
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:25,375
and...

45
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:35,041
This is the form
I now assume.

46
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:36,541
Call me thus,...

47
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:37,750
Yuji Sakai...

48
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:39,750
the Snake of the Festival.

49
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:46,958
[Music]

50
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:18,083
The Snake of the Festival...?!

51
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:19,625
Impossible!

52
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:21,125
It can't be...

53
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:23,666
Yes... dear Alastor...

54
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,166
It is possible,

55
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:28,041
for I am the counterpart
to the Flame of Heaven...

56
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm the God of Creation...

57
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:33,458
I am Snake of the Festival.

58
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,916
How are you standing
before us?!

59
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,375
You were sealed in the Abyss
by the ancient Flame Haze...

60
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:41,958
You once grew so
arrogant in your power

61
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:45,541
that you attempted to alter
the world's very foundations!

62
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:47,666
So you're a god from
an old fairytale

63
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,708
who was banished
for eternity...?

64
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:51,291
Then what the hell
are you doin' here?

65
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:52,625
The Abyss is a rift

66
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:54,833
between the human
and Crimson worlds

67
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:57,958
where even the gods
are powerless!

68
00:05:58,041 --> 00:06:00,500
Bal Masque has been
without their master...

69
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:03,291
that would indeed explain
their lack of focus.

70
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:04,583
We were not aware.

71
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:15,625
Shana...

72
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,583
You're not...

73
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:22,583
Yuji!

74
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:31,583
I don't care what you say!

75
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:32,875
Wrong...

76
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:35,500
I am Yuji Sakai...

77
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:36,833
Now come.

78
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,791
We can question him
once he's been captured!

79
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:55,125
Formidable foe.

80
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,916
You're damn straight!

81
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,416
Yuji!

82
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,500
Whether he's telling
the truth or not...

83
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:17,875
He claims to be

84
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:21,000
one of the most infamous
monsters in history...

85
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:23,333
Who knows what he
might have planned.

86
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:25,041
What's going on...?

87
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:26,708
Is the Denizen that
they're fighting

88
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:28,500
pretending to be Sakai?

89
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:30,583
No... It can't be...

90
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:34,625
I can hear it in
Shana's voice...

91
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:37,000
Whoever she's dealing
with right now...

92
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:38,791
It really is Sakai!

93
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:00,000
I'm sorry, Shana...

94
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,000
But I'm not leaving
without you.

95
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:31,333
We've been trapped!

96
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:35,291
Shana.

97
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:37,000
Yu... ji...

98
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:45,416
Lemme go!

99
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:50,541
Snake of the Festival!

100
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:52,583
What kind of sick
joke is this?

101
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:54,541
What do you want from us?!

102
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:56,458
I assure you it's
not a joke...

103
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:58,166
The truth is...

104
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,166
we need each other.

105
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,458
Don't you dare speak...

106
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:04,625
with his voice!

107
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:05,791
Shana...

108
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:07,250
Come with me...

109
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:09,208
That is the only
reason I'm here.

110
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:10,833
You bastard...

111
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:12,958
I want us to be together.

112
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:14,125
Why, Yuji...?

113
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:15,791
Why now...?

114
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:18,083
You've never said
that to me before...

115
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:20,125
I know...

116
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:21,625
I was scared to say it...

117
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:24,000
but... I'm not scared anymore.

118
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:28,708
We don't have long...

119
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:30,833
Will you agree
to come with me?

120
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:37,083
Such a shame...

121
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:42,458
I didn't want to
resort... to force.

122
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:44,333
Don't run from me, Shana!

123
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,916
Humpty-dumpty
sat on a wall!

124
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,333
Humpty-dumpty
had a great fall!

125
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:10,458
All the king's horses...

126
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:12,666
And all the king's men...!

127
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,375
Couldn't put Humpty
together again!

128
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:22,958
I don't have time to deal
with you right now...

129
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:24,541
Margery Daw.

130
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:28,166
So, do me a favor and stay
put a little while longer?

131
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,458
Not even if you begged me!

132
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:33,083
Then, listen closely
to what I have to say.

133
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:37,916
I learned something
while I was away...

134
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I think it might...
interest you.

135
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:43,250
Something...

136
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:44,833
About the Silver.

137
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:48,208
What...? Silver...?

138
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:49,250
Tell me! What do...?!

139
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:50,916
Calm down, Margery...!
It's a trap!

140
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,625
What do you know about
the Silver...? Tell me!

141
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:54,041
You mustn't
listen to him...!

142
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:55,875
Indeed, he is
only taunting you

143
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:58,750
because he knows that is
what you want to hear most.

144
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:00,291
False information.

145
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:01,291
I don't care...!

146
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:02,666
He has something to say...

147
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,625
and I wanna hear it!

148
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:06,708
I'd be more than
happy to tell you...

149
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:10,291
Yuji... don't...! Please!

150
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:12,041
About the Silver.

151
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:15,500
Yuji!

152
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:18,041
Would you just spit
it out already?!

153
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:20,583
First, I want you to
take a look around you.

154
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:35,416
The suit of armor you
see is not a Denizen.

155
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,208
It's a physical
manifestation

156
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:39,500
of fragments of
human emotions;

157
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:41,583
people's hearts given form.

158
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,791
These countless
fragments of humanity...

159
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:58,000
Are like cogs in a machine
tracing out my identity...

160
00:11:58,083 --> 00:11:59,916
The Silver only
appears before those

161
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,458
who possess
strong emotions...

162
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:04,625
It has no will of its own.

163
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:15,041
It carries out the
desires of the one

164
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:17,208
from which it draws emotion.

165
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:21,166
Its behavior is a reflection
of what it has taken in...

166
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,250
It has no mind of its own.

167
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:38,291
You saw a physical
manifestation of your hatred...

168
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:40,791
Its sneer was your own...

169
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:43,291
secret desire.

170
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:45,375
Do you understand...?

171
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:47,916
You don't need to
seek revenge...

172
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,041
The Silver didn't
kill those men...

173
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:53,583
You did, Margery.

174
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:55,208
No way...

175
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:57,750
it... was me?!

176
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:04,000
It's over.

177
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:05,291
Yuji...

178
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:16,541
Watch your surroundings.

179
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:40,166
Margery?!

180
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,083
Are you okay...?!

181
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:42,833
Answer me!

182
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:45,625
The Chanter of Elegies
has received information

183
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:47,875
which has greatly
traumatized her...

184
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:51,416
She is in a precarious
state indeed.

185
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,666
She's breaking down.

186
00:13:58,291 --> 00:13:59,625
You must get a
hold of yourself.

187
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:00,833
Maintain your will.

188
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:01,916
Aw, crap!

189
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,791
Our contract's
about to break!

190
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:05,583
Snap out of it! C'mon!

191
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:07,041
You gotta pull through.

192
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:09,833
Is this really how
you wanna go out?

193
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:11,166
It's no use!

194
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,375
I can't get
through to her!

195
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:13,625
No, Margery...!

196
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:15,333
Don't you dare die,
y'hear me?!

197
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:16,625
We need you!

198
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:30,750
For as long as I
can remember...

199
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:34,250
Others have relied on me.

200
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:39,750
I helped and
was betrayed...

201
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,250
Then I was relied
on once again.

202
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:49,250
I was sick of it...

203
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:51,958
And sick of myself for
allowing it to happen.

204
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:56,208
And that...

205
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:58,791
that is why I hated them.

206
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:02,666
They destroyed everything
I wanted to destroy myself.

207
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:07,791
Little did I know...

208
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:20,666
I did destroy
it all myself...

209
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:24,083
I have no reason to go on.

210
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:27,833
Please don't die!

211
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:30,500
You've gotta pull
through this, Margery!

212
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:32,541
Why the hell should I...?

213
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:34,750
So you can use me some more?

214
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:37,958
You gotta stick
around for Sato!

215
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:41,166
You can't leave him
without even sayin' goodbye!

216
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,958
Tanaka's right!

217
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:44,333
Think about Sato...

218
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:46,125
and how you feel for him!

219
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:48,791
I know he feels the
same way about you...!

220
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:50,791
You've been loved
for a long time...!

221
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:53,000
Longer than you know!

222
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:55,500
He feels... the same?

223
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:57,875
-Margery!
-You have to fight!

224
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:03,750
Margery has no
fight left in her...

225
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:07,333
And Wilhelmina is busy
protecting herself...

226
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:09,583
Finally, we are alone.

227
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:10,916
That's it...

228
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,125
I've had enough...

229
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:15,041
I'm taking you down, Yuji!

230
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:22,208
It's Blutsauger...

231
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:42,750
That's right...

232
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:45,083
You don't know how to
give up, do you, Shana?

233
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:46,625
Will you shut up?

234
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:48,583
Which is why the
only path for us...

235
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:50,833
is the one that
leads to battle.

236
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:51,833
Shut up!

237
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:54,666
So I'll fight...

238
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:57,458
to find my way
into your heart!

239
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:59,041
Shut! Up!

240
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:14,625
Why is this so hard?

241
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:16,166
I haven't even been
able to hit him

242
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:17,541
with a surprise attack!

243
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,000
Of course not!

244
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:22,041
He knows my powers
better than anyone.

245
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:41,041
But, does he know
I can do this?!

246
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:52,916
It's his house...

247
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,125
Shana.

248
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:58,666
Yuji...

249
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,750
You're gonna leave
Chigusa behind?

250
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:03,625
Yes...

251
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,375
It's what I must do.

252
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:07,000
And you're not being
controlled...?

253
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:08,958
You're doing this of
your own free will?

254
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:10,458
That's right...

255
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:12,583
There's no one else
speaking for me.

256
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:16,541
Do you think that...

257
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:19,750
you could protect
everybody you love?

258
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:21,833
What if...

259
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:23,416
your loved ones...

260
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,375
were attacked by a
Crimson Denizen...

261
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:27,791
Would there be enough...

262
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:30,000
Flame Haze to
guard each of them?

263
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:32,125
I don't...

264
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:34,000
There are too many
people in this world

265
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:35,333
to protect them all...

266
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:38,375
In Misaki City alone...

267
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:40,916
I've met so many that
I want to protect...

268
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,958
and yet it's impossible...

269
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:44,708
That's why...

270
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:48,041
I'm going to change this
world for the better... Shana...

271
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:51,125
I'm going to remove the
chance of them getting hurt...

272
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:52,541
To save them...

273
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:54,375
To save the people I love!

274
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:58,666
People like you...

275
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,833
You may be a tool
of destruction,

276
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:02,708
but I care for you.

277
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:04,708
Flame Haze are
forced to fight

278
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:06,875
until their luck
eventually runs out

279
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:09,333
and they simply disappear...

280
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:12,166
I'm going to keep you
from suffering that fate.

281
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:15,291
Like it...

282
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:16,458
Or not.

283
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:21,458
There is nothing you
can do to stop me.

284
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:23,833
I am determined to
have you by my side

285
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:26,250
as the world changes.

286
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:27,583
But... why?

287
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:30,583
For you...

288
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:33,416
I've always dreamed
of being with you...

289
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,083
So I've made myself
stronger... like you wanted...

290
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:37,833
Much stronger...!
All for you...!

291
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:40,666
And now I fight...
I fight with you...

292
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:43,250
so that one day we'll
never have to fight again!

293
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:15,375
It's heading this way!

294
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:17,583
Yoshida...! We've
gotta get out of here!

295
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:20,166
It's just Sakai...

296
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,458
We're fine.

297
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:31,583
I'm sorry...

298
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:33,625
I didn't realize
you were here.

299
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:43,166
Wh... What're
you doing here?

300
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:45,083
Is that Shana?!

301
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:46,958
You... saved her, right...?

302
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:49,833
is she gonna be okay?

303
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:51,791
Yeah, she'll be fine...

304
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:54,458
I'm taking her
back with me.

305
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:55,583
I've come here...

306
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:57,250
to reclaim The
Crystal Altar.

307
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:08,833
No! You can't take it!

308
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:10,666
I don't see the problem...

309
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:13,041
The Alter has been mine
from the beginning.

310
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:18,708
No, wait!

311
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:22,583
You're taking... her...
with you?

312
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:24,541
Does she mean
that much to you?

313
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:27,083
Yes.

314
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,125
But my letter...

315
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:34,375
Why'd you...?

316
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:35,833
I had to...

317
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:40,083
It's the only way I
could send a message...

318
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:41,666
without saying a word.

319
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:47,541
I wanted to let you
know I was still alive

320
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:50,625
without writing
a response...

321
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:52,416
because I knew it
would hurt you.

322
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:57,375
Why didn't you...

323
00:21:57,458 --> 00:21:59,041
just tell me?

324
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:00,875
I suggest you go
home, Yoshida.

325
00:22:03,083 --> 00:22:06,791
I haven't changed anything
yet, but I assure you,

326
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:08,958
it's a much better
place to be than this.

327
00:22:35,666 --> 00:22:37,708
You're safe... Shana.

328
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:43,750
[Music]

329
00:24:14,875 --> 00:24:16,875
With Shana trapped in the
Palace of the Stars,...

330
00:24:16,958 --> 00:24:18,750
and Margery out
of commission,...

331
00:24:18,833 --> 00:24:20,708
Wilhelmina devises
a daring plan

332
00:24:20,791 --> 00:24:23,083
to rescue Shana
by herself.

333
00:24:23,166 --> 00:24:25,333
Next time on Shakugan
