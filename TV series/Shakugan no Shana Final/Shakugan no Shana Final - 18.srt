1
00:00:54,625 --> 00:00:57,291
What the...?
Do you see that?

2
00:00:57,375 --> 00:00:58,750
What is that thing?

3
00:01:01,166 --> 00:01:02,291
Are those clouds?

4
00:01:02,375 --> 00:01:03,625
Or maybe a mirage?

5
00:01:21,083 --> 00:01:26,791
[Music]

6
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,791
We've come to escort
you and your guest

7
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:55,750
to the Palace of the Stars.

8
00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:58,208
Master, we'll
follow your lead.

9
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:06,833
Come along.
Don't be afraid.

10
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:08,416
I won't let them harm you.

11
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:17,083
I have to go with him.

12
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:20,333
It's the only way I can
find out what he's up to.

13
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:24,291
I wanna believe he's
telling me the truth.

14
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:25,750
But I'm not sure.

15
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,541
I cannot thank you
enough, Yoshida.

16
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:32,250
I could not do
this without you.

17
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:35,041
But I'm just a human.

18
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:37,083
Are you sure that I'm
going to be able to help you?

19
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:41,291
I'm positive, in fact, it's
something nobody can do but you.

20
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:43,083
You see, I need the
knowledge of someone

21
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:44,416
who has worked
with the tuners

22
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,541
to restore Misaki City
in the past.

23
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:51,125
Don't worry.

24
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:53,583
I won't let the Crimson Denizens
lay a hand on you.

25
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:55,041
You have my word.

26
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:08,958
You've spent
thousands of years

27
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:12,500
waiting patiently for
this moment to arrive.

28
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:17,083
Your wait will be over
this evening at midnight.

29
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:29,666
In order to create the
paradise, Xanadu,

30
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,958
we must first open
a portal of sorts

31
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:34,833
to transfer power between
this world and the rift.

32
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:38,833
A portal?

33
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:40,500
But how?

34
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:41,791
If you'll recall,

35
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:43,916
you were asked to
participate in the tuning

36
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,875
because you were born and
raised in Misaki City.

37
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:48,875
The tuner was able to
repair the damage

38
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:51,750
by restoring it to the
image conjured in your head.

39
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,000
Now that we have your help,

40
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:57,583
we can use the Anti-Shield
Unrestricted Spell

41
00:04:57,666 --> 00:04:59,541
to find the repairs

42
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:01,625
and temporarily
expand any gaps.

43
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:05,208
Once that's been
accomplished,

44
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:06,875
all of the things
in this world

45
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:09,125
will no longer connect
to one another,

46
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:11,458
and they will
cease to exist.

47
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:13,583
Think of it as a piece
of woven, silk cloth

48
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:15,708
that suddenly
has holes in it.

49
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:17,416
I see.

50
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,291
The power you need to
create the new world,

51
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:22,208
it will be sent to you
through those holes?

52
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:24,250
Correct.

53
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:27,083
This plan should relieve some
of the God of Creation's stress.

54
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:30,458
He seemed quite
happy about it.

55
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:32,500
I'm sure.

56
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:34,833
These portals, you're
going to open them here,

57
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:37,458
in Misaki City?

58
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:38,833
Yes.

59
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:40,625
As I told you before

60
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,833
this is all part of
Yuji Sakai's plan.

61
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,708
Now, activate!

62
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,666
Why do you need this?

63
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:58,458
It will show me what you
repaired in the tuning,

64
00:05:58,541 --> 00:05:59,708
so it can be undone.

65
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,750
Welcome to the
Palace of the Stars.

66
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,875
Finally.

67
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:12,500
I've found a place
I truly belong.

68
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,291
Bel-Peol!

69
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:17,750
Sir.

70
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:27,166
I'm only trying to
protect you, Yoshida.

71
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,416
I'm sorry.

72
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,291
But I have to control
the power of the pendant

73
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:31,791
you are carrying.

74
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:34,000
I can't have you
calling her with it.

75
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:37,625
Not that she's a threat.

76
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:40,791
A single Crimson Lord isn't
powerful enough to stop me,

77
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:43,875
especially not her.

78
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:45,333
I suppose.

79
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:47,125
I should be happy,

80
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:49,333
sacrificing myself
to use Giralda

81
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:52,166
isn't an option anymore.

82
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,875
But without the power
of that Treasure Tool

83
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:55,833
I'm just an ordinary human.

84
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,708
I'm completely helpless.

85
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:00,541
I got so carried
away in the excitement

86
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:02,541
of seeing him again,

87
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:05,291
that I didn't think
about the consequences.

88
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:06,583
I never even contemplated

89
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:09,291
that he might
try to stop me.

90
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:13,041
I've finally realized I was
blinded by my feelings for him

91
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:15,583
but it's too late.

92
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:17,916
I can't let it
get to me now.

93
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,250
I have to stay focused.

94
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:22,625
I can't lose sight
of why I'm here.

95
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:27,750
Hello from the control room!

96
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:29,291
We're ready to
begin the process

97
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:31,375
of transferring the Palace
of the Star's functions

98
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:33,333
to the True Ruler's Shrine!

99
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:35,750
Just say the word, okay?

100
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:37,583
I don't see any
reason to wait.

101
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:39,416
Start the process now.

102
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,458
You got it!

103
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:43,583
All systems are go!

104
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:45,375
Domino!

105
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:47,291
I'm right here at your
service, professor...

106
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:49,833
Prepare to activate the
transformable alloy deluxe,

107
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:53,833
the miracle of science,
Excellent 252570,

108
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:57,166
Altar Shrine of the
Celebratory Ruler!

109
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,375
I'll press the button.

110
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:45,083
Behold! Isn't it glorious?

111
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:49,041
Bel-Peol.

112
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:50,208
Yes, sir.

113
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:55,375
Tartaros.

114
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:57,250
Synchronize with the Seal.

115
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:09,458
It's done, master.

116
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:12,250
The spell is complete.

117
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:13,458
I told you,

118
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:15,708
I intend to protect
the people of this city.

119
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:17,833
No one within the Seal
will be devoured,

120
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:20,000
no matter how brutal
the war becomes.

121
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:21,375
Oh.

122
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:23,000
That's good.

123
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:24,916
Master, with your permission,

124
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,041
I'd like to start prepping
the troops for battle.

125
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:28,833
Fine.

126
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:31,791
Make sure our forces are
prepared not only for the war

127
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:33,583
but the chaos
that awaits them.

128
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:34,708
Yes, sir.

129
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:39,583
Finally, the moment
of truth is upon us.

130
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,333
Now, my priestess.

131
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:43,958
Begin the final stage.

132
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:44,958
Yes, sir.

133
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:48,791
I am Supreme Throne, Hecate,

134
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:51,458
closest of those
to our master.

135
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:53,875
I raise my staff, Trigon,

136
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:56,250
to open a path to
the minds of others.

137
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:12,250
My loyal servants.

138
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:13,708
Look to the sky!

139
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:15,750
Behold the divinity
before you!

140
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:31,000
As one of the leaders
of this operation,

141
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:32,666
I would like to
say a few words

142
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,958
before we end
this meeting.

143
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:36,500
As the God of Atonement,

144
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:39,333
I have judged the enemy's
actions to be in violation

145
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:42,166
of the laws of the
world as I see them.

146
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,916
Therefore, they must be
condemned and punished.

147
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I believe this operation
is our only viable option.

148
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:50,500
I would like to
thank each of you

149
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,208
for fighting alongside us.

150
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:56,291
Flame of Heaven,
there's no need to thank us.

151
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:57,875
Words unnecessary.

152
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:59,416
All right.

153
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,500
I realize the task
ahead is a difficult one

154
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:03,916
but we must stay strong

155
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,666
and we cannot forget that
we are fighting for justice,

156
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,333
and the fate of this world.

157
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:17,083
I suppose it's time we
get started as well.

158
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:23,250
I know that voice.

159
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:24,625
Is that you, Lamies?

160
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:26,250
Why yes, it is.

161
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:29,041
I'm amazed you're able
to remember my name.

162
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:31,166
I haven't seen
you in ages.

163
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,166
Tell me, why are you here?

164
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:36,916
I volunteered to create the
Anti-Shield Unrestricted Spell

165
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,458
so I'd have the chance
to speak to you again.

166
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:43,375
I recognize this pattern.

167
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:45,750
It's the tuning mark Khamsin
carved into the city.

168
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:53,791
Activating Anti-Shield.

169
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:08,041
There's no need
to be afraid.

170
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:14,625
The image you saw was
not reality, my dear.

171
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:15,958
I'm sorry; I
would've warned you

172
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:18,708
had I known it would have
such a violent effect.

173
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:20,916
Shall we try again?

174
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,250
Okay.

175
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:28,625
Something doesn't
feel right.

176
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:32,833
It's like...

177
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:35,333
I don't feel at
peace here anymore.

178
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:38,250
You're not experiencing
any pain, are you?

179
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:40,125
No. I'm fine.

180
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:41,541
So, what now?

181
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:43,041
Your work is done.

182
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:45,083
The preparations
are complete.

183
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:47,333
Oh, in that case,

184
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:49,541
may I ask you something?

185
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:51,875
Of course.
Ask away, my dear.

186
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:56,166
How come you've sided
with Bal Masque?

187
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,625
Are you helping them so
you can get into paradise?

188
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,541
I have been promised a portion

189
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:04,416
of the Power of Existence
the Crimson Denizens

190
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,750
will leave behind on
their way to Xanadu.

191
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:09,291
However, I would
never consider myself

192
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:11,500
an ally of Bal Masque.

193
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:14,625
I am simply using them
to fulfill my own desire.

194
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:20,333
Here they come;

195
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:23,375
all of the Crimson Denizens
seeking paradise.

196
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:25,375
We've reached Misaki City!

197
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:32,791
I can't believe this.

198
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:34,333
They just keep coming.

199
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:36,791
I wasn't expecting
this kind of turnout.

200
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:39,333
I've never seen so many
Crimson Denizens before!

201
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:43,125
I knew our
numbers were many

202
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:45,750
but to witness them in
motion is almost terrifying.

203
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:52,291
Their excitement is
infectious, isn't it?

204
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:54,791
Look how proudly they march
toward the Grand Order!

205
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,875
Wow, look at that.

206
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:00,458
We've waited three
thousand years

207
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:01,958
for this day to come.

208
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,291
It almost brings a tear
to your eye, doesn't it?

209
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:05,708
Yes ma'am.

210
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:08,333
I have no doubt that this
will be a splendid day

211
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:09,666
for the living and the dead.

212
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:18,500
Judging by the cards
we've been dealt

213
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:20,208
and the number of
Denizens out there,

214
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:21,666
I'd say our
chances of success

215
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,625
are much better
this time around.

216
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:25,416
Priestess.

217
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,750
We are ready to begin.

218
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:29,833
Please proceed to the throne.

219
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:32,833
The time has come.

220
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:39,291
We will now proceed
to the final stage.

221
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:42,250
I shall activate the
Psalm of the Grand Order,

222
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:44,875
then intone the
Ceremonial Prayer,

223
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:48,708
which will create
the paradise, Xanadu.

224
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:52,166
Transfer back-up functions
to the Conloquiem.

225
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,791
Transfer confirmed.

226
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:15,375
I guess this is goodbye,

227
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:19,250
my beloved Supreme
Throne, Hecate.

228
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:20,875
Yes.

229
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:23,083
I hope that we meet again,

230
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:24,583
my friend, Sydonay.

231
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:41,958
Is that her shadow?

232
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:45,208
It's merely a projection of
existence cast within the zone.

233
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:46,583
The reason it's wavering

234
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:48,750
is because it's been chosen

235
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:51,875
as the sacrifice for the
summoning of divine power.

236
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:54,000
She sacrificed herself?

237
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:55,875
That's the role
of the Priestess.

238
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:57,833
She's given her
life for our cause,

239
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:59,666
but she isn't lost forever.

240
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,833
I'm comforted knowing
she'll be reborn someday.

241
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:05,208
After the God of Creation
summons his divine power

242
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:06,750
to grant a wish,

243
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:09,875
he will sleep for a time
equivalent to the wish granted.

244
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:11,375
While the god sleeps,

245
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:13,250
the Priestess
will be reborn

246
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:15,291
so that she's present
to grant our next wish

247
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:17,250
when the god awakens.

248
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:19,083
However, she can
only appear to us...

249
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:21,125
...when our prayers have
grown strong enough

250
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:22,875
to call forth the god.

251
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:27,958
Whenever she is reborn we know
our God will soon follow.

252
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:30,708
It's a sign our prayers
have been heard.

253
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:32,791
She is treated with
the utmost respect

254
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:35,791
because she is our savior.

255
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:49,500
With the amount of power
it'll take to do this,

256
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:53,583
who knows how long it'll
be 'til I see her again.

257
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:56,500
Though it may not
be what she wanted,

258
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:59,541
she accepted her fate
without question.

259
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,333
I feel a strange presence.

260
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:11,750
It's a Flame Haze!

261
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,083
The sky is too dark.

262
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:28,500
May light rain down!

263
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:36,833
We are the stars.

264
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:38,458
The singing stars.

265
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:41,125
The stars who sing
with dazzling light.

266
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:42,625
We are the birds.

267
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:44,500
The birds who
breathe flame.

268
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:47,708
We are free to fly the
heavens as we please.

269
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:50,708
When brought together,
we birds and stars...

270
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:53,750
Become a galaxy,
dazzling and aflame.

271
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:57,041
Damn it!

272
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:59,000
They convinced the Four Gods
of the Earth

273
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:00,333
to fight alongside them?

274
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:03,500
I think we should just
sit this one out, big guy.

275
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,416
We can't give up
without a fight.

276
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,208
Let's go!

277
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:08,791
Okay, fine.

278
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:11,833
But don't say that
I didn't warn ya.

279
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:13,041
Oh no.

280
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:15,916
The Four Gods of the Earth?

281
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,166
Got ya!

282
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,250
There's no escape,
Flame Haze!

283
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:20,458
Take this!

284
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:33,458
Oh you brutes!

285
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:35,083
How could you?

286
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:37,041
You're not supposed
to attack a lady!

287
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:46,500
Stop this insanity

288
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,500
and return to the
Crimson World at once!

289
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:49,916
Please, I beg of you.

290
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:01,208
Thank you, friends.

291
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:07,333
What'll we do, Lerajie?

292
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:08,875
We'll have to fight her.

293
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:10,250
We don't have a choice.

294
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,000
That's the spirit!

295
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:30,875
Well done, my
beautiful dead!

296
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:33,375
Devour their souls
and multiply!

297
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:35,958
A banquet of blood
and fire awaits you!

298
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:39,000
Feast yourselves on the
souls of these evil spirits!

299
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,583
Wait! Stay back, men!

300
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:48,833
The Bright Flame
warned me about you,

301
00:19:48,916 --> 00:19:50,958
Commander of Evil Spirits.

302
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:53,375
Our fellow priest,
He Who Walks with Rain,

303
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:55,041
was a kind and
peaceful soul.

304
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:57,791
Unlike us, he never
mastered the art of war

305
00:19:57,875 --> 00:19:59,666
nor did he take joy in it.

306
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:03,000
He didn't deserve to
die by your hands.

307
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:04,625
That victory was
a gift given to me

308
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:06,583
by the master
and the General.

309
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:08,583
I was actually defeated
in that battle.

310
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:11,000
I had little to
do with his death.

311
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:12,250
I don't care.

312
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:14,416
You're the one who's
going to pay the price.

313
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,916
I'll slaughter you and every
evil spirit in your army

314
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,125
with my bare
hands if I have to.

315
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:22,041
Whatever it takes
to avenge his death.

316
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:23,416
And ripping you to pieces

317
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,208
seems like a good
place to start!

318
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:27,916
What do you say,
Commander?

319
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,750
Care to take us on in
a fight to the death?

320
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:33,708
You against me and
all my weapons?

321
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:35,291
How could I resist?

322
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:47,666
It's coming.

323
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:52,708
Shoot them down!

324
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:58,500
We're trying to find a
line we can break through.

325
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:00,166
Just hold on
until then, okay?

326
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,125
They're headed this way.

327
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:16,041
We can handle them.

328
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,250
I think this is a
good time to split up.

329
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:26,333
Good luck to you.

330
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:27,458
Thanks!

331
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:28,750
See you later!

332
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:36,583
Shana!

333
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:37,583
Kazumi!

334
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,458
You ready?

335
00:21:56,541 --> 00:21:59,291
Yes, I am.

336
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:00,625
Let's finish this!

337
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:03,750
No way.

338
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:05,166
They're going to fight?

339
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:20,875
Sakai's doing this
all of this for Shana.

340
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:23,166
You can see it
in his eyes.

341
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:24,791
And I can tell

342
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:27,291
that Shana's determined
to defeat Sakai.

343
00:22:28,375 --> 00:22:29,625
Each of them cares
for the other

344
00:22:29,708 --> 00:22:32,291
more than anyone
else in the world.

345
00:22:32,375 --> 00:22:34,083
I don't understand.

346
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:35,791
Why do they have to
fight one another?

347
00:22:41,625 --> 00:22:42,583
Why?

348
00:22:42,666 --> 00:22:48,625
[Music]

349
00:24:14,708 --> 00:24:16,916
Shana and Yuji face off
in a passionate battle

350
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,250
of heart and soul.

351
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:20,750
As Yoshida watches, she
is overcome with emotion.

352
00:24:20,833 --> 00:24:23,291
She takes up Giralda,
causing a mysterious wind

353
00:24:23,375 --> 00:24:24,750
to blow through
the battlefield.

354
00:24:24,833 --> 00:24:26,958
Next time, on Shakugan
no Shana Final:

355
00:24:27,041 --> 00:24:28,166
"What the Wind Calls."
