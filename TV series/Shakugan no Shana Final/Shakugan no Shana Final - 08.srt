1
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:51,875
I'll show you and
the rest of the world...

2
00:00:51,958 --> 00:00:53,666
my desire for change!

3
00:00:54,916 --> 00:00:56,041
Yes...

4
00:00:56,125 --> 00:00:58,041
That is my heart's desire...

5
00:00:58,125 --> 00:01:00,416
And it will
soon be reality.

6
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,958
My Unrestricted Spells

7
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:04,583
still aren't strong enough
to get me out of this...

8
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:06,166
There's only one
thing I can do...

9
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:11,166
All military forces are
now ordered to advance!

10
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:19,958
[Music]

11
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:47,750
Ah, sorry to make you
get up at this hour.

12
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:48,875
But it would
be best for us

13
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:50,875
to get an early start
on our journey.

14
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:53,583
I wish Sato was here to
say goodbye to you guys.

15
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:55,458
Jeez, it's not like
they're leavin' forever!

16
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:58,500
They'll see him when they
make it back to town.

17
00:02:58,583 --> 00:03:00,458
Eita Tanaka...

18
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:02,000
I hope you understand...

19
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:04,875
how grateful I am to
you and Keisaku...

20
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:08,000
Thank you... for all that you've
done to help us thus far...

21
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:09,208
Please follow
the instructions

22
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:11,708
I've left for
Margery's care...

23
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,083
Hopefully, it won't
be too long...

24
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:14,333
'til we meet again.

25
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:15,666
Take care of yourself.

26
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,166
Yeah, you too...

27
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,666
Hope ya make it out ali...

28
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,333
I'm sorry, that slipped out...

29
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:24,125
Uh... You're gonna be fine;
I don't know what I'm sayin'.

30
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:26,750
We'll catch up with ya whenever
sleeping beauty wakes up.

31
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:29,208
Don't hog all the fun
before we get there.

32
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:31,333
Indeed, we'll be
looking out for you.

33
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:33,375
Anticipated reunion.

34
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:35,416
I really don't want
to get involved...

35
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,458
but now that I know the world's
fate is riding on this war...

36
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:40,000
I don't think I'll
have any choice

37
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:42,166
but to get involved
at some point.

38
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:43,750
Good luck out there...

39
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:45,750
Our world is counting on you.

40
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:05,083
It's been several days

41
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:08,458
since Bal Masque's army left
the Palace of the Stars.

42
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:09,708
I can't help but wonder

43
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,041
whether the fighting's
already started...

44
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:13,583
Surely, I would know...

45
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:15,625
A war between Flame Haze
and Denizens

46
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:17,541
would quickly spread
all over the world.

47
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:23,250
If so, Bal Masque is fighting
without the Trinity...

48
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:25,166
Thousand Changes, Sydonay...

49
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,791
The Judge of Paradoxes,
Bel-Peol...

50
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:29,916
And the Supreme
Throne, Hecate.

51
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:33,291
The Flame Haze army should
attack while they're away

52
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:34,833
and their army is weak...

53
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:36,083
Hopefully...

54
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:38,666
Sophie Sawallisch has
come up with a strategy.

55
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:44,666
For now, all I can do is have
faith and wait patiently...

56
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,625
until it's my turn
to join the battle.

57
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:48,291
We're finished, my lady.

58
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:00,958
I wonder if Wilhelmina...

59
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:02,833
is out there
fighting somewhere.

60
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:48,541
You must move quickly.

61
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:53,541
Indeed, I will.

62
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,208
Aw, c'mon...!

63
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:02,625
I don't understand what the
heck's takin' her so long?!

64
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:05,208
She's only been gone
for half an hour.

65
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:06,916
Do ya think she could
be stuck on somethin'?

66
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,666
Maybe we should
go check on her?

67
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,583
She'll be fine...

68
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:11,916
She lived there
for a long time

69
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,875
so she's probably
just reminiscing.

70
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:16,291
She requested to go
down there alone...

71
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:19,083
and we should
respect her wishes.

72
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:21,083
Patience is a virtue.

73
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:22,166
Fine...

74
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,208
I'll show you
patience, buddy!

75
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:26,666
Come on!

76
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:37,958
Please, grant me your power.

77
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:40,916
Heaven's Road Palace...

78
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,791
Surface!

79
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,333
Oh wow!

80
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:48,583
I suspect their objective

81
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:50,916
in the Eastern
Theater is Japan.

82
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:53,666
It would appear

83
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,458
they are attempting to
push our defensive lines

84
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:56,833
back to America.

85
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:02,083
Uh... Commander...?

86
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:05,458
Let me guess,
they've attacked Tokyo?

87
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:08,875
Yes how very
perceptive of you.

88
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:11,833
If so... why haven't we
received emergency reports?

89
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:13,500
Well?! Answer the man!

90
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:16,916
It seems we've
lost all contact

91
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,708
with our Tokyo Headquarters...

92
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:24,166
They've surrounded
it with a Seal...

93
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,708
The war has begun.

94
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,083
Second barrage...

95
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:39,291
Fire!

96
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:45,833
Attention
artillery squads...

97
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:47,458
you may fire at will!

98
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:49,750
Disregard the Rinne.

99
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:52,166
Attack squads follow me!

100
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,333
Charge!

101
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,916
Heavy damage to
Central Park!

102
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,416
Enemy forces have been
reported in the shrine garden,

103
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,916
heading towards the
Nishi-Sandoguchi intersection!

104
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,416
The Choja Bashi Defense
Force is en route.

105
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,750
Northern forces are
falling back to the

106
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:10,416
Shimizu-Bashi intersection.

107
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,291
Damn Ribesal...

108
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:15,208
It seems he's just as
good a Commander as ever.

109
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:16,791
Are we okay here?

110
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:19,833
You don't think he'll come
looking for us, do you?

111
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:21,708
Sir...! One of our
northern squadrons...

112
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:23,791
has launched an assault!

113
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:24,666
What?!

114
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:32,541
That'll show 'em...

115
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:34,083
Never underestimate
a Flame Haze!

116
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:35,750
Let's break through
their lines!

117
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:39,791
What the hell?!

118
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,166
No! Don't breathe
in the mist!

119
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,625
It's the Unrestricted
Spell Daimon!

120
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:54,375
Damn, I tried
to warn them.

121
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:56,041
Betcha we can snap
'em out of it...

122
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:57,666
if we just punch
'em hard enough.

123
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,500
That was too easy.

124
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:09,708
Our northern lines have
fallen into disarray!

125
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:12,291
It's a rout, sir!

126
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:13,708
They should have listened.

127
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:15,833
Um, do you think maybe
it's time for us

128
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:17,708
to go somewhere
safer Flieder?

129
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:18,916
Yes, Brigid...

130
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,125
I'd have to agree.

131
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:23,666
Everyone, it's come
to my attention

132
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,791
that our safety has
been jeopardized here...

133
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,833
Therefore... we must move to
the emergency command room!

134
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:30,291
Yes, sir!

135
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:32,541
Withdraw...! Who'll send a
message to the front lines?!

136
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:35,125
I'll take care of that.

137
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:36,375
If I don't make it back,

138
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:38,083
you're going to
have to take command.

139
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:39,166
Yes, sir.

140
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,791
But don't you worry!

141
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:42,791
I'm sure we'll make
it back safely!

142
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,125
This could be dangerous...

143
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:45,208
Will you join me?

144
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:46,791
Yes, of course!

145
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:57,500
I'll take it from here...

146
00:10:57,583 --> 00:10:59,083
Hurry and get
her to safety!

147
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:02,958
Well, well, well.

148
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:06,791
I haven't seen you in seventy
or eighty years, Ernest...

149
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,375
Oh, excuse me...

150
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:10,958
You go by Flieder
now, don't you?

151
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:12,458
Ribesal...

152
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:15,083
I would think a high-ranking
commander, like yourself,

153
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:17,166
would know better than to
fight on the front lines.

154
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:20,125
I imagine Pirsoyn
finds it exhausting.

155
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:21,500
Shut up!

156
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:40,708
You can't fool me!

157
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,208
There's the real one!

158
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:00,458
We've got you now!

159
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:04,166
We've received a
status report...

160
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:07,041
It's from a messenger who was
able to get outside the Seal.

161
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:09,000
They confirm the presence
of enemy commander,

162
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:11,291
Dashing Earthly
Fiend Ribesal.

163
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:13,375
They go on to report that
our forces confronted him

164
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:15,166
in Shinjuku as planned.

165
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,958
We correctly identified
their location...

166
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:20,500
Has there been any change
on the Western Front?

167
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:22,833
No, I've been keeping
an eye on it, sir...

168
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:24,833
I haven't noticed
any major changes.

169
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:26,083
As far as I can tell,

170
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:28,208
their attacks seem
to be intensifying.

171
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:30,583
An attempt to
distract us, no doubt.

172
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:31,833
In the Western Theater,

173
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:34,250
Burning Agitation Haborym
and his forces

174
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:38,125
have besieged our headquarters
in Romania, Andrei Fortress.

175
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:41,000
Distraction or not, their
attacks have been relentless.

176
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:53,458
We've no choice but to
match their efforts.

177
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:56,333
It is imperative that we
defend the Outlaw posts,

178
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:59,083
otherwise we risk
compromising our future plans.

179
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:00,750
So far, so good.

180
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:02,916
Several posts have
sustained serious damage,

181
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,750
but thankfully none
of them have fallen.

182
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:09,125
They've launched a
coordinated attack

183
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:10,791
to both the East and West...

184
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:12,666
The fronts in
this war are larger

185
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,791
than any other in
recorded history.

186
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:17,208
And to think, it's all to
divert our attention away

187
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:18,750
from the Trinity.

188
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:21,291
Their Strategist,
the Judge of Paradoxes

189
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:23,791
is convinced one of
our fronts will fall.

190
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:25,375
She knows if that
were to happen,

191
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:27,291
we would be too busy
rebuilding our lines

192
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:29,333
to adequately
protect ourselves.

193
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:31,125
It appears...

194
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:33,375
the enemy has deployed the
majority of their forces

195
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:34,875
to fight in the
two fronts...

196
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:36,916
so, we can assume that
only a handful of troops

197
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,625
were left behind to guard
the Palace of the Stars.

198
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:42,791
In other words, this would
be the perfect time

199
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:45,125
to launch a surprise attack.

200
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:47,833
While it is a
risky strategy...

201
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:49,833
I wholeheartedly
trust your judgment

202
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:51,041
and therefore agree that

203
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:53,958
this is exactly how
we should proceed.

204
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,791
We've been watching for
Thousand Changes Sydonay

205
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:59,333
but he's yet to make an
appearance on the battlefield.

206
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:03,666
I believe his absence confirms
what we already suspected...

207
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,625
The Trinity is
up to something.

208
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:06,958
Yes, indeed...

209
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:08,416
and it doesn't
surprise me...

210
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:12,208
What is it, ma'am?

211
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:15,000
One of the Four Gods...

212
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:17,333
The Beckoner of
Brightened Dew...

213
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:18,833
Centerhill?

214
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:30,791
I don't understand...

215
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:33,500
As long as it is not too
much of an imposition,

216
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:36,750
we would like to temporarily
join your ranks.

217
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:38,833
Does this mean we can
expect assistance

218
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:41,916
from the Four Gods of the
Earth in this battle?

219
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,666
No... the other three gods have
asked that I observe you...

220
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,750
and then report
my findings.

221
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:50,833
We have yet to decide
whose side we will take.

222
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:52,833
Bal Masque is
endangering the Earth

223
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:55,958
by attempting to revive
the God of Creation.

224
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:57,041
Knowing that,

225
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:58,333
how could you
still be uncertain

226
00:14:58,416 --> 00:14:59,958
of your stance
on the matter?

227
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:02,958
As you know, we four
priests received our powers

228
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:05,833
from those Crimson Lords
revered as gods...

229
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:07,166
And we have
devoted our lives

230
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:10,083
to destroying the evil
spirits known as Denizens.

231
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:12,166
After much deliberation
on the subject,

232
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,250
we've come to
this conclusion...

233
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:16,791
It makes no
difference whether...

234
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:19,583
they act as gods or prowl
the Earth as evil spirits...

235
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:21,125
Since time immemorial,

236
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:23,708
Crimson Denizens have
been an integral part

237
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:25,708
of the natural
order of this world.

238
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:28,291
As it is our duty to
uphold that order,

239
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:30,541
we cannot simply act
without first determining

240
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:32,458
the true intentions of
the one who calls himself

241
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:34,916
the God of Creation.

242
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,166
Therefore, until we
have that information...

243
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,208
we must remain neutral.

244
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:40,666
However...

245
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:43,375
once you have ascertained
Bal Masque's true intentions,

246
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:46,000
you will clarify
your position?

247
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:47,208
Yes.

248
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:48,708
Then there's
still a possibility

249
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:50,333
that you will
agree to help us?

250
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:54,541
In that case...

251
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:55,750
I would be more
than honored

252
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:57,458
to grant you a
place at our table.

253
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:01,208
We've positioned
saboteur teams

254
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:03,458
at radar stations
across Europe.

255
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:04,791
According to our reports,

256
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:07,291
initial transports
have already departed.

257
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:09,291
The second and third
waves are set to depart

258
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:10,708
on schedule as well.

259
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:12,791
Everything's going
exactly as planned.

260
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:14,416
How were you able to
gather all that data

261
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,041
on such short notice?

262
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:17,541
Well... you see...

263
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:19,375
We've worked for Outlaw...

264
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:21,250
for several hundred
years now, sir.

265
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:26,291
I'm so sorry I made a mess
of things, Supreme Commander!

266
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:30,416
You must calm yourself,
Adjutant Francois Auric.

267
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,958
You mustn't get flustered...

268
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:33,041
for the fate of the world

269
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:35,083
is now dependent
upon your judgment.

270
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:36,291
Sir!

271
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:42,208
The path to life is found
only beyond death's horizon...

272
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:43,583
young man.

273
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,916
The real fight has
only just begun.

274
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,875
The storm is rolling in.

275
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:55,041
Excellent! Isn't this exciting?!

276
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:57,458
Have you ever seen
anything so wondrous?!

277
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:59,708
I can't believe the
Abyss is so colorful!

278
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:02,500
It's even more spectacular
than I'd imagined!

279
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:04,666
This is Path of Pilgrimage...

280
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:05,916
How were you
capable of building

281
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,875
such a massive
structure in the rift

282
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:09,750
between the two worlds?

283
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:11,041
He's a god...

284
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:13,541
He's capable of anything!

285
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:15,000
That's correct...

286
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:17,291
my power allowed
me to create it...

287
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:18,625
This intricate...

288
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:20,000
Meandering...

289
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:21,291
pathway...

290
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:22,750
leading to myself.

291
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,458
Which we... now walk.

292
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:26,666
It's not as though we have
any choice, Priestess.

293
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,333
We've no other option.

294
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:30,208
I don't think
you realize...

295
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:33,208
how lucky you are to
have this experience.

296
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:34,333
The Path of Pilgrimage

297
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:36,750
was constructed by
the master himself.

298
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:39,791
He used his powers as a
god to craft deprivation,

299
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:43,125
suffering and despair
into a physical path.

300
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:44,916
Because of its
transient nature,

301
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,166
we must travel in the
company of the Priestess.

302
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,708
She is the only one capable
of picking up the signal

303
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:51,333
emitted by the Insignia,

304
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:53,625
which is linked to
the master's body.

305
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:55,208
Without her unique ability

306
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:57,375
we would lose our
way, or worse...

307
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:58,333
Ain't that the truth?!

308
00:17:58,416 --> 00:17:59,916
If my calculations
are correct,

309
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,291
only fifty-four percent
of the Path of Pilgrimage

310
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:03,833
has materialized.

311
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,708
There are areas where the
percentage can drop to

312
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:07,125
as low as thirty-four!

313
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:08,708
So watch your step!

314
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:10,666
There's no need
for you to worry!

315
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,250
We'll be fine as
long as we continue

316
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:13,708
to follow the Priestess!

317
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:15,583
There isn't even a
microscopic chance

318
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:17,000
that we could get lost!

319
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:19,958
Hurry...

320
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:21,375
It's a long walk.

321
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:26,666
I seek the path but all
that returns to me...

322
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,500
is the sound of
wind and sand.

323
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:35,041
Decarabia reporting.

324
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:37,000
Do you read me,
Fortress Commander?

325
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:38,250
Yes, indeed...

326
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:39,875
I read you loud and clear,
Supreme Commander.

327
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:42,625
I hope all is well with
our offensive forces.

328
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:44,083
Any news to report?

329
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:45,708
All troops have
been deployed

330
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,000
to their various
stations as planned...

331
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:49,166
However...

332
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:50,375
What is it?

333
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:52,291
It concerns me that
there has been no sign

334
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:55,458
of The Braider of Trembling
Might, Sophie Sawallisch.

335
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:57,041
Do you suppose she
could be lying in wait

336
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:58,541
for General Sydonay...?

337
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:00,791
I'm sure she finds his
absence suspicious.

338
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:03,250
It is a possibility,
but an obvious one...

339
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:05,250
too obvious.

340
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:07,041
Fortress Commander Fecor,

341
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:09,916
I request permission to
prepare the forces charged

342
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,708
with protecting the Palace
of the Stars for battle.

343
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:14,083
The forces here?

344
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:16,250
You do realize the enemy
can not find the Palace,

345
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:17,750
let alone attack it,

346
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:20,250
while it's concealed by the
Crypta Unrestricted Spell.

347
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:21,750
If you have any
evidence otherwise,

348
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:23,166
please fill me in.

349
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:24,750
I have no evidence...

350
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:26,000
And I am well aware

351
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:28,333
that although the Palace
is centuries old,

352
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:30,791
its presence has never
been detected by an enemy.

353
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:31,875
Then why...?

354
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:33,750
Call it intuition.

355
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:35,791
Everything is
going too smoothly.

356
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:38,125
The Flame Haze have
been oddly quiet

357
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:41,541
which leads me to believe they
must be plotting something.

358
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:43,458
Then permission is granted...

359
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:45,208
Supreme Commander...

360
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:46,708
do whatever you must...

361
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:48,541
to protect the
Palace of the Stars

362
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:50,625
until the master can return.

363
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:51,958
Very well...

364
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:53,625
I will make the
order at once.

365
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:03,833
I don't understand...

366
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:07,875
Why didn't my Unrestricted
Spell work against Yuji?

367
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:10,375
Is it because I haven't
mastered it yet...?

368
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:13,458
Or is he so powerful now that
it's too weak to affect him?

369
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:16,541
I don't know...

370
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:19,583
When he left, it was almost
too easy to say goodbye.

371
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,916
But now...

372
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,375
I wanna see him.

373
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:28,291
I wanna see Yuji!

374
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:31,250
He's the leader of my
enemy, Bal Masque...

375
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:34,125
and I'm the Flaming-Haired
Blazing-Eyed Hunter...

376
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:36,541
If we came face-to-face
we would have to fight.

377
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:39,250
I know that but
I don't care...

378
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:41,875
I just wanna see him again.

379
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:45,708
That's the only way
I'll know for sure...

380
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:48,625
You've got to stop
fooling yourself, child.

381
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:53,208
The time has come to
unite you with yourself.

382
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:55,583
The Flaming-Haired
Blazing-Eyed Hunter and Shana

383
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:57,875
must become one
and the same...

384
00:20:57,958 --> 00:21:00,000
Otherwise I'll never be
able to confront him

385
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:02,291
and show him the new
power I've found.

386
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:06,875
The strongest
Unrestricted Spell...

387
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:09,416
This love I feel for him.

388
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,291
The problem is...
I can't do anything

389
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:13,541
as long as he's
holding me captive.

390
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:15,375
If I tried to confront him
while I'm helpless like this,

391
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:17,750
he'd easily defeat me.

392
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:19,541
I need to break free of
this restrictive chain

393
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:22,416
and recover my
Flame Haze powers.

394
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,833
To do that, something's
gotta happen...

395
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:26,875
Something that'll give
me the opening I need.

396
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:31,541
This is ridiculous!

397
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:34,333
The biggest war in history
is being fought as we speak

398
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:37,708
and we get stuck down
here on watchman duty?!

399
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:40,541
Why do we have to miss
out on all the fun?!

400
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:42,375
Would you quit
your whining?

401
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:44,791
Supreme Commander
Decarabia ordered us

402
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:47,041
to protect the
Palace of the Stars.

403
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:48,333
Protect it from what?

404
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,750
Give me a break!

405
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:53,208
It's not like the
enemy's gonna come here.

406
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:54,416
What's wrong?

407
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,666
Who is that?

408
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:57,750
Man this sucks...!

409
00:21:57,833 --> 00:21:59,416
I mean the freakin'
war of the century

410
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,166
is goin' on out there...

411
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:04,291
Why did we agree to hang out
in this musty, old Palace?

412
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:12,208
Yo!

413
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:14,000
You seem cool

414
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:15,083
but... ya gotta go.

415
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:24,833
Okay...

416
00:22:24,916 --> 00:22:26,791
Ready to get started...
old man?

417
00:22:26,875 --> 00:22:28,666
Yeah, I'm ready
if you are...

418
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:32,041
but we should probably get
outside the Palace walls first.

419
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:33,250
Ceremonial...

420
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:34,666
Equipment.

421
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,958
Deploy Qadesh's
Blood Seal.

422
00:22:37,041 --> 00:22:37,916
Activate.

423
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:42,916
Constructing
Unrestricted Spell:

424
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,416
Qadesh's Blood Pulse.

425
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,750
Deploying!

426
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:53,333
Synchronizing to
Unrestricted Spell:

427
00:22:53,416 --> 00:22:54,833
Qadesh's Blood Pulse.

428
00:22:58,666 --> 00:23:00,083
That is so cool!

429
00:23:00,166 --> 00:23:01,250
We'd better get a move on!

430
00:23:01,333 --> 00:23:03,083
Gotcha!

431
00:23:03,166 --> 00:23:04,458
Yahoo!

432
00:23:07,291 --> 00:23:09,291
Wanna help the big guy
tear the place down, Balar?

433
00:23:09,375 --> 00:23:10,833
You know it!

434
00:23:10,916 --> 00:23:12,791
There's nothing I enjoy more
than wreaking destruction!

435
00:23:21,291 --> 00:23:22,375
This is it...!

436
00:23:22,458 --> 00:23:24,041
The distraction I
need to break free!

437
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:35,541
What's going on?

438
00:24:05,708 --> 00:24:06,875
Ya ready, Gramps?!

439
00:24:08,208 --> 00:24:09,250
Let's go!

440
00:24:14,791 --> 00:24:17,208
Rebecca and Khamsin's attack
on the Palace of the Stars

441
00:24:17,291 --> 00:24:19,333
causes it to
descend into chaos.

442
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:20,708
Amidst the confusion,

443
00:24:20,791 --> 00:24:22,458
Shana waits for
the perfect moment

444
00:24:22,541 --> 00:24:24,125
to make a break
for her freedom.

445
00:24:24,208 --> 00:24:26,541
Next time, on Shakugan
no Shana Final:

446
00:24:26,625 --> 00:24:28,208
"To the Palace of the Stars."
