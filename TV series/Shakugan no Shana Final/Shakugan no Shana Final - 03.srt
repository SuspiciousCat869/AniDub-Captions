1
00:01:56,208 --> 00:01:57,416
I'm back...

2
00:01:58,791 --> 00:02:01,000
Time to settle this...

3
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:02,208
once and for all.

4
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:09,041
[Music]

5
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:51,208
I'm leaving for the
Tokyo Outlaw tomorrow.

6
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:52,625
To Outlaw?

7
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:55,416
Margery says that
I need to go,

8
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,541
to figure out if this is what
I really wanna do with my life.

9
00:03:58,625 --> 00:03:59,791
Yeah, I guess...

10
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:01,666
So... are you jealous?

11
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:16,250
Jeez I just talked
to him yesterday.

12
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:17,791
What took ya so long?!

13
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,583
We've got trouble...

14
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:22,958
There's a Crimson Denizen
heading into town!

15
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:24,541
That's not my
problem anymore...

16
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:27,625
Like hell, it's not!

17
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:29,000
Margery's gonna
need somebody

18
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:31,416
to help her monitor
the Crystal Altar.

19
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,583
Talk to her...

20
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:34,375
but don't use
your bookmark...

21
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:36,208
You don't wanna draw
this one's attention.

22
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:37,541
Wait...

23
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,000
Don't let me down...

24
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:42,125
Tanaka.

25
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:48,750
I swore I wouldn't
get involved again...

26
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:50,791
not after what
I saw that day.

27
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:53,875
Damn it, Sato!

28
00:04:57,333 --> 00:05:00,666
I'll do it but you owe
me big when you get back!

29
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:19,500
Come on, it's the
middle of the damn day!

30
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:21,166
Don't ya think it's a
little early to start

31
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:25,375
boozin', my terrible
timekeeper, Margery Daw?

32
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,791
Nobody asked you, Marco.

33
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:30,416
Don't tell me you're
already missin' the kid?!

34
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,375
He practically just left...

35
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,416
Say one more word
and you're dead!

36
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:45,625
Whoa, you feel that?

37
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:47,166
Of course I do.

38
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,291
Ya think it's
a powerful one?

39
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:54,250
It seems to be...

40
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:56,083
Just when I thought
I might get a break.

41
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:01,166
Margery...

42
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,375
Eita?

43
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,375
You've come a
long way, indeed.

44
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:31,250
A vast improvement.

45
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:33,000
It's still not good enough...

46
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:33,958
but thanks.

47
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:46,625
You feel that presence?

48
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,583
It's a Crimson Denizen...

49
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:52,291
No... judging
from its power...

50
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:53,625
it's a Crimson Lord.

51
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:57,625
I see...

52
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:00,083
so Keisaku contacted you?

53
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:01,458
Yes, ma'am.

54
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:03,375
The poor guy crossed
paths with a Denizen

55
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:04,958
the moment he left town...?

56
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:07,416
Sounds like he's got a
serious case of bad luck.

57
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:10,833
It's got nothin'
to do with luck!

58
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:12,083
I bet he would've been fine

59
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:13,250
if you hadn't kept
him up drinkin'...

60
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:14,791
Shut your trap!

61
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,291
Let's go see what kind of
Denizen we're dealing with...

62
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:20,958
but before we
venture out...

63
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:25,291
Well, I'll be damned.

64
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:26,583
Look at you...!

65
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:28,708
Gettin' used to this
workin' as a team thing...

66
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:29,916
aren't ya... doll?

67
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:35,291
You hear that?

68
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:36,958
Indeed, it's my phone.

69
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:39,291
What made you decide
to carry a phone?

70
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:41,916
Well, everyone has them-

71
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,166
I didn't want to be
behind the times.

72
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:45,791
Convenient contraption.

73
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:49,125
This is Wilhelmina.

74
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:51,000
You felt that
presence, right?

75
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:52,416
Indeed, I did.

76
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,708
Is the midget with you?

77
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:55,125
She's right here.

78
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:56,625
Good...

79
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:57,583
I wanna see what
we're up against

80
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:59,666
so I'm going
Denizen hunting...

81
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,250
Just stand by until I
get back to you, okay?

82
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:04,250
We will, indeed.

83
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:05,666
Before we head out...

84
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,291
shouldn't we check
the Crystal Altar

85
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:09,208
for Unrestricted Spells?

86
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:10,791
We don't have
time for that...

87
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:12,750
but I sure wish we did
'cause I'd like to know

88
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:15,000
what to expect instead
of going in blind.

89
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:17,166
I'll check the
Altar for you!

90
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,250
Are you sure you
wanna get involved?

91
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:28,208
I'm sure.

92
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:30,416
He's serious...!

93
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,625
You can't turn him down now!

94
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:35,125
Fine, I'll leave
the Altar to you...

95
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:37,250
Give me a call me
if you see anything.

96
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:38,208
You got it!

97
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:43,375
She is going to
check things out.

98
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:44,625
We're on standby.

99
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:49,416
Is something wrong?

100
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,833
Hey Wilhelmina...

101
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:52,458
What is it, milady?

102
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:53,833
May I borrow your phone?

103
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,250
I've never seen
this number...

104
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:10,958
Hello...?

105
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:12,458
Oh, hi Shana!

106
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:14,000
Listen carefully...

107
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:16,166
There's currently a
Crimson Denizen on the loose

108
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:19,083
in Misaki City.

109
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:21,375
I don't have any
evidence yet...

110
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:22,791
but I have a suspicion

111
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:25,583
that Bal Masque has
something to do with this.

112
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,875
Bal Masque?

113
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:29,458
Unfortunately...

114
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:32,083
it looks as though we're going
to end up in another battle...

115
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:33,083
Kazumi...

116
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:35,083
will you help?

117
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:37,958
Tanaka's offered to
monitor the Crystal Altar.

118
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:39,916
Please say you'll
meet him there...

119
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,250
If not, you'll need to get
out of town immediately.

120
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:44,541
I'm not leaving.

121
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:48,000
I'll stay and help...

122
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:50,541
If there's one thing I've
learned from all of this mess...

123
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:52,666
it's that this is
where I belong.

124
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,208
I'm not gonna run
like a coward.

125
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:56,291
Thanks...

126
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:57,541
See you soon.

127
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:13,000
Here it is.

128
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,416
-Let's go.
-Okay.

129
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:13,250
I feel bad.

130
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:18,666
I hope they at least
received the letters.

131
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:23,541
But, at this point...

132
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:24,708
it doesn't matter anymore.

133
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:29,500
'Cause I'm here...

134
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:31,375
and I've made up my mind.

135
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:36,208
Is that...?

136
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:37,708
Yeah, it is...

137
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:39,083
What the hell?!

138
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:45,125
Hello? This is Shana.

139
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:46,416
I've got news...

140
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,250
But I need you to
promise you'll stay calm.

141
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:50,875
The powerful
Denizen presence

142
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:52,916
we've been sensing
is actually...

143
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:58,625
What did the
Chanter say, milady?

144
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:00,541
Request explanation.

145
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:25,166
I remember this place...

146
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,166
This is where
it all began.

147
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:30,458
I was minding
my own business

148
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:33,958
when everything around me
suddenly turned a deep red.

149
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:35,583
At the time,
I didn't know

150
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:37,500
I had been trapped
inside a Seal.

151
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:49,333
Delicious!

152
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:50,416
They're so tasty!

153
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,333
What the hell...?!

154
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:54,250
What's going on...?!

155
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:55,500
What is this?!

156
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:01,208
I got you!

157
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:03,250
It's time to eat!

158
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:16,583
Who did that? !

159
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:29,541
That's when I met her...

160
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:32,583
The girl with blazing eyes
and flame colored hair.

161
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:37,000
It may sound cliché,

162
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:40,583
but I think it was fate
that brought us together.

163
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:42,000
At least,
that's what the Yuji

164
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:43,791
who's standing
here now thinks.

165
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:50,833
I have so many
memories here...

166
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:52,833
Shame I have to
leave them behind.

167
00:13:58,041 --> 00:13:59,916
Shana?

168
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,791
Are you certain
about this...

169
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:08,041
I haven't been down
this street in ages.

170
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:16,000
I remember this museum...

171
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:19,208
Yoshida and I came
here together.

172
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:22,375
I forget what
exhibition we saw...

173
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:24,750
I suppose I'm lucky
to remember any of it

174
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:26,625
after everything that
happened that day.

175
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:34,250
The Corpse Collector, Lamies.

176
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:35,791
No...

177
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,208
The Spiral Organ,
Leanan Sidhe.

178
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,083
I remember when the
Chanter of Elegies,

179
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:47,750
Margery Daw, first came to
this city in search of him.

180
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:54,833
I can't believe I was actually
afraid of her back then.

181
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:01,958
At the time...

182
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:04,625
I never would've guessed
that Sato and Tanaka

183
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:06,458
had chosen to
be by her side.

184
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:14,958
I'm still haunted

185
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:17,750
by the memory of the first
Denizen Shana and I defeated...

186
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:21,833
Friagne the Hunter.

187
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:28,958
At the end,

188
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:31,750
it was your voice that gave
me the strength I needed.

189
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:36,500
Well, it's good to know
I could be of some help.

190
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,875
Most of my existence
has been drained...

191
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:43,833
I guess I'm gonna
disappear pretty soon.

192
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:47,666
Take care now, Shana.

193
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:51,916
It was after that battle,

194
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,625
I first learned
of its power...

195
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:59,000
The Treasure Tool
inside of me...

196
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,875
The Midnight Lost Child.

197
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:08,833
We walked down this
street during the parade.

198
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:17,208
If I could go back, there's
one thing I'd change...

199
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:25,875
He can't be...

200
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:26,916
Not Sakai!

201
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Yoshida...
What's wrong?

202
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:37,708
-This is...
-It can't be...

203
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:38,625
It can't!

204
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:44,500
I tried to keep my
secret from Yoshida...

205
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:46,541
But in the end,

206
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:49,083
her curiosity got
the best of her.

207
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:51,625
Even after she knew
I wasn't human...

208
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:56,625
That's what I like about you
more than anything else...

209
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:02,625
She still loved me...

210
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:05,708
Despite it all, her feelings
for me have never changed.

211
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:09,291
C'mon, you can do it.

212
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:46,583
That said...

213
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:50,833
Kazumi isn't the only one
who accepted me as I am.

214
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:54,041
Sato and Tanaka did, too...
and so did...

215
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:58,375
There's a secret that
we've been keeping from you.

216
00:17:58,458 --> 00:17:59,875
That's why Dad felt
comfortable telling me

217
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:01,000
about my older brother

218
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:03,125
who died before
I was born...

219
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:05,375
the reason he gave
me the name Yuji...

220
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:06,583
and about...

221
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:08,000
Yeah, I did.

222
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:11,083
Mom's pregnant.

223
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:13,083
Oh...

224
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:15,333
Awesome.

225
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:16,625
Congratulations...!

226
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:17,791
Wait a sec...

227
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:20,083
This is a good
thing, isn't it?

228
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:22,291
It is...

229
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:24,125
Congrats to you, too.

230
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:27,125
Big brother.

231
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:28,958
Brother...

232
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,208
huh?

233
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,583
Thankfully, there
will be a new life...

234
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:43,916
to fill the void
I've left behind...

235
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,250
A little brother or sister

236
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:49,041
who will keep my
mother company.

237
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,666
I'm so sorry, Mom.

238
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:00,666
I wish I could stay
here with you...

239
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:08,833
But I'm afraid I'm not the
same person I was before.

240
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:13,958
Misaki...

241
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:16,625
Fight...! On...!
Fight...! On...! Fight! On...!

242
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:18,000
Misaki...

243
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:20,166
Fight...! On...! Fight...!
On...! Fight! On...!

244
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,500
Misaki...

245
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:23,958
Fight...! On...!
Fight...! On...! Fight! On...!

246
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:25,250
Misaki...

247
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:27,458
Fight...! On...! Fight...!
On...! Fight! On...!

248
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:28,500
Misaki...

249
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:29,750
Fight! On!

250
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:33,416
Misaki...

251
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,916
Fight...! On...!
Fight...! On...! Fight! On...!

252
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,875
Misaki...

253
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:39,750
I knew they would
forget about me...

254
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:44,166
But it hurts nonetheless.

255
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,416
Misaki...

256
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,500
Fight...! On...!
Fight...! On...! Fight! On...!

257
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:56,666
The decision's been made.

258
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,541
There's no turning
back now...

259
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:00,125
I have to do this.

260
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:13,000
When I first learned I
was no longer human,

261
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:16,458
I was overcome with
paralyzing fear...

262
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:18,500
I've since come
to grips with it

263
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:20,000
and now that fear is gone.

264
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:26,083
I know the path I've chosen
is a long and difficult one...

265
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:28,625
but it will lead me to
the future I desire.

266
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:56,666
Now I'm able to grasp

267
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,750
what was once
beyond my reach.

268
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:04,000
I'm not the pitiful Torch
that I was before.

269
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,208
My feelings for her are the
only reason I've come here.

270
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:36,125
It's because of her that
I've finally realized...

271
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:41,791
It's okay to love...

272
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:43,541
I can't believe it
took me this long

273
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:45,708
to recognize
something so simple.

274
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:06,250
I'm here...

275
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:09,833
though it was a
difficult journey.

276
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:16,750
I have come back for you...

277
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:20,875
Shana!

278
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:28,750
Yuji!

279
00:22:31,291 --> 00:22:37,000
[Music]

280
00:24:14,708 --> 00:24:16,916
Shana and I are forced to
put aside our feelings

281
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
as our swords
finally cross.

282
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:20,708
When faced with
the bitter truth,

283
00:24:20,791 --> 00:24:22,916
how will Margery Daw respond?

284
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,166
Next time, on Shakugan
no Shana Final:

285
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:27,666
"Reunions and Chance Meetings."
