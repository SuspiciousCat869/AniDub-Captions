1
00:00:58,208 --> 00:00:59,666
Hold your lines!

2
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:08,708
The situation is
worse than we thought.

3
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:11,208
You should consider withdrawing
while you still can.

4
00:01:11,291 --> 00:01:13,916
It would be irresponsible
for us to leave now.

5
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,500
We've yet to see anything
that would sway our stance.

6
00:01:18,125 --> 00:01:19,333
How can that be?

7
00:01:20,791 --> 00:01:22,166
Is there something wrong?

8
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:23,125
No, ma'am.

9
00:01:25,291 --> 00:01:28,625
I feel a strange energy
emanating from the gate.

10
00:01:28,708 --> 00:01:30,666
But what is it?

11
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:33,416
There is a strong presence
on the other side.

12
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,583
Who could it be?

13
00:01:34,666 --> 00:01:35,833
You don't think this means

14
00:01:35,916 --> 00:01:38,416
the Snake of the Festival's
returned, do you?

15
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,625
That would be my guess.

16
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,375
I hate to damage such
beautiful artwork.

17
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:44,041
It's nothing but a
god's ephemeral dream

18
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:45,416
of the living world.

19
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,458
You shouldn't feel
guilty for destroying it.

20
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:10,416
Ah, that was too
close for comfort.

21
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,500
So much as a scratch from
his blade could prove deadly.

22
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:15,125
We must proceed
with caution.

23
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:17,541
Yeah, to put it lightly.

24
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:22,666
Just as we planned.

25
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:28,000
Ceremonial Equipment.

26
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:29,958
Deploy Qadesh's
Blood Seal.

27
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:37,333
Activate.

28
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,708
Constructing
Unrestricted Spell:

29
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:42,250
Qadesh's Blood Pulse.

30
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:45,041
Deploying.

31
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:49,666
Synchronizing to
Unrestricted Spell:

32
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,083
Qadesh's Blood Pulse.

33
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,250
Impossible!

34
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:07,416
Ah, it worked.

35
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,750
It did, indeed.

36
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:13,541
Your attacks weren't
aimed at me;

37
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:15,583
their sole purpose was
to produce rubble.

38
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:18,833
You may be sharp but
you can't outwit me.

39
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:25,750
Ah.

40
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:27,125
He's found our weakness.

41
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:28,375
He's ripping
apart the debris

42
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:31,166
we worked so
hard to collect.

43
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,250
Battle breeds destruction.

44
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:35,750
We have no choice but
to accept it as fact,

45
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:37,708
for that is the
way of the world.

46
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:39,333
You may find this
hard to believe,

47
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:42,208
but you and I aren't really all
that different from one another.

48
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:44,000
We both lead
clandestine lives,

49
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:46,791
carrying out our missions,
and killing as we are told.

50
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:52,083
And, like you, I often
find myself victorious

51
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,958
not because of an
innate talent or gift...

52
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:57,583
...but because of the vast
power that I command.

53
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:23,750
Come on.

54
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:24,791
Destroy!

55
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:47,250
Khamsin Nbh'w!

56
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:48,333
Awaken!

57
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:00,416
I don't understand.

58
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,750
What point is there

59
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:04,000
in obsessing over
something this futile.

60
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:52,458
Shana. If you'll agree
to lay down your sword,

61
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:53,833
I'll allow you to
return to my side,

62
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:55,916
and we will forget
this ever happened.

63
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,291
I'd be more than happy
to lay down my sword

64
00:06:58,375 --> 00:07:01,125
if you'll agree to stop working
for the enemy and help me!

65
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:03,250
Why would you
ask that of me?

66
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,250
No. I can't, Shana.

67
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:13,958
I'm sorry.

68
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:15,375
In all sincerity,

69
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:17,833
I've not withheld any
information from him.

70
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:22,583
Yuji Sakai made the decision
to walk alongside me,

71
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:24,041
knowing full well
what would happen

72
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:27,791
if the Grand Order
were to be achieved.

73
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:28,958
He wants to free you,

74
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:30,750
the Flaming-Haired
Blazing-Eyed Hunter,

75
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:32,916
from your fate
as a Flame Haze.

76
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,083
He wants to protect
those close to him;

77
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:36,125
his family and friends.

78
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:37,750
That is why he
made the choice.

79
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:41,583
To join me and my
servants, Bal Masque!

80
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:55,500
The boy has chosen
to align with us;

81
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:58,333
your mindless prattling
will not sway his resolve.

82
00:07:58,416 --> 00:07:59,583
Tell me, Bel-Peol,

83
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:01,916
is my return having the
effect we predicted?

84
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,583
Professor, can you synchronize

85
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:05,041
with the Conloquium from here?

86
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:07,791
Of course I can, anything
for you, my three-eyed beauty!

87
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:10,583
This invention can detect any
change in the outside world

88
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:12,666
and report it to
me here, in the Abyss!

89
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,583
It's all thanks to me

90
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:17,916
and, of course, the
miracle that is science!

91
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,666
May I present the 252546
Logical Pilgrim's Box!

92
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:26,541
It should be noted

93
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:29,083
that while the Professor worked
diligently on this invention

94
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:31,333
it has yet to be test...

95
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:33,125
Now, here we go!

96
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:34,625
Press!

97
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:35,875
One press of the button

98
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:38,416
and the helmet falls
right on your head!

99
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,375
A turn of the dial.

100
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:41,000
And I can see it all!

101
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:42,625
Your return has had a
huge effect, Master!

102
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:44,875
You are on fire, professor!

103
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:47,083
The Abyss is being torn
apart by massive quakes,

104
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:49,375
more powerful than any
ever felt on Earth!

105
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:51,125
The collapse of
its giant structures

106
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:53,958
is causing a contraction in
the rift between the worlds!

107
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:55,833
This contraction
has materialized

108
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:58,000
in the form of a
natural disaster

109
00:08:58,083 --> 00:09:01,416
unlike any other we've
seen in recorded history!

110
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,041
Here and now,

111
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:08,083
I proclaim this destructive
force be named the Mistquake!

112
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:26,291
It is true.

113
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:28,833
The God of Creation
has returned.

114
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:43,083
The Mistquake.

115
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,291
Yes.

116
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,833
A relentless tremor that
will shake the Earth

117
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:47,375
to its very core.

118
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:50,291
Only those who control
Power of Existence feel it.

119
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:51,583
Now that it's begun,

120
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:53,625
I'm one step closer to my goal,
the Grand Order.

121
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:32,875
Whoa. What's goin' on here?

122
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:35,125
I couldn't tell ya,
but one thing's for sure,

123
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:37,916
whatever it is, it's not
likely to help our situation.

124
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,083
Yeah. Guess it's time to go.

125
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:41,083
Where's Chiara?

126
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:47,458
What's happening
down there?

127
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:49,750
The ground is shaking but
it's not an earthquake.

128
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:51,958
Think it's an enemy
Unrestricted Spell?

129
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:53,583
No way.
It can't be.

130
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:56,416
The Denizens
look uneasy, too.

131
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,000
Mammon!

132
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:08,875
This is it!

133
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:11,708
The natural disaster the
Strategist told us about.

134
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:14,791
This is precisely the
distraction we need right now!

135
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:18,416
Attention troops!

136
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,041
This quake is the
work of our master,

137
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:21,875
the Snake of the Festival!

138
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:24,708
We must use it to our advantage
and charge the enemy base!

139
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:26,625
All forces, move out!

140
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:01,958
Ah.

141
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:04,333
Our attacks are having
no effect on him.

142
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:05,791
What do you think
we should do?

143
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:08,375
All we can do is defend
ourselves for now,

144
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:11,833
and hope that our situation
will soon change for the better.

145
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:13,916
Well, it looks like we're
stuck walkin' the tightrope

146
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,083
until that happens, huh?

147
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:21,125
I don't understand
why you insist on

148
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,375
continuing this
pointless battle.

149
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:26,125
What could you
possibly stand to gain?

150
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:27,708
Why won't you
just give up?

151
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:40,666
You'll "conquer" me
and force me to obey?

152
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:47,333
Alastor.

153
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:48,791
Your contractor is attempting

154
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:51,041
to use your power
to threaten me.

155
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:53,083
Don't you have anything
to say on the matter?

156
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:55,416
Before she agreed to
forge the contract

157
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,541
which would make her

158
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:58,458
the Flaming-Haired
Blazing-Eyed Hunter,

159
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:00,916
Shana said this to me:

160
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,416
I've been told that Flame
Haze are bound by duty

161
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,875
to fight Crimson Denizens

162
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:07,041
in order to maintain
the world's balance.

163
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:08,791
But I will determine
whether or not

164
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:12,250
I should fight on a
case by case basis.

165
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:15,250
In other words, it doesn't
matter how much you love me,

166
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:17,916
nor does it matter how
much I love all of you.

167
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,541
If I don't think it's
the right thing to do,

168
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:20,708
I won't do it.

169
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:29,833
My iron-willed
contractor refuses

170
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:32,875
to blindly follow your
path towards the Grand Order.

171
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:36,208
She insists on attempting
to create her own instead.

172
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:38,500
Who am I to
stand in her way?

173
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:43,208
As you know, she possesses
greatness unlike any other.

174
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:46,833
There is no one more
worthy of being my contractor.

175
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:49,708
She courageously goes
where others fear to tread,

176
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:52,250
and she does so with
her head held high.

177
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:54,416
While it is true that
Atonement protects the world

178
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,916
from disruption,

179
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,291
it also stands to become
the world's final judgment!

180
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:02,125
Therefore, I will walk
alongside this great one,

181
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:05,583
as she charts a path that
will benefit everyone.

182
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:08,708
Very well then.

183
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:12,000
It is unfortunate that our
paths must diverge this way.

184
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:14,791
But I will return to make my
declaration of the Grand Order

185
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:16,416
and you can't stop me.

186
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,166
Oh no. It's the God of Creation!

187
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,416
Holy crap!

188
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,291
The guy's an actual snake?

189
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:59,041
The Snake of the
Festival has returned!

190
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:00,458
Our master.

191
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:02,791
A true Crimson God!

192
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,750
Activate!

193
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:07,833
Deploy Qadesh's Blood Pulse!

194
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:10,541
Synchronize!

195
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:12,750
Release Qadesh's
Blood Pulse!

196
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:57,875
This time we got ya, bozo!

197
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:20,958
The sheer enormity.

198
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:23,083
It's amazing!

199
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:24,541
Could this be the end?

200
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:30,500
Well, well, looks like
someone got their butt kicked.

201
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:32,958
You'll have stay shackled until
we can make it out of here.

202
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:34,125
I would rather die.

203
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:35,583
What was that?

204
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:37,083
You heard me.

205
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:38,916
Sabrac?

206
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,125
I want to stay,

207
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,166
and watch it a
little while longer.

208
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:48,708
It's massive,
an overwhelming power

209
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:50,958
that's far too
strong to resist.

210
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:54,333
What is this
horrible feeling

211
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:56,583
that's suddenly
washed over me?

212
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:58,791
Is this how I made you feel?

213
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:02,291
Is this the reason
you left me, Mare?

214
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:04,041
Although I know it's wrong,

215
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:07,750
I can't help but be
jealous of your power.

216
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:10,375
Mine is inferior
in every way.

217
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:12,416
It's so weak and frail.

218
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:16,625
I had no idea this was
how I made you feel.

219
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:20,250
I'm sorry.

220
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:21,500
Now I understand

221
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,583
why you couldn't bear to
stay with me any longer.

222
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,833
This magnificent
presence has taught me

223
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:31,958
that there are beings far
more powerful than myself.

224
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,000
From its perspective,

225
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:38,666
there is no difference
between you and me.

226
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,708
We are equally frail.

227
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:44,041
Perhaps that will bring
a smile to your face,

228
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:46,750
my beautiful butterfly.

229
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:09,250
We've lost our ally, Sabrac,

230
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:10,666
the Destructive Blade.

231
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,500
That's a shame.

232
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:14,750
We managed to make
it out alive somehow.

233
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:17,083
Yeah, but we've got
a long way to go.

234
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:19,958
Indeed, we must stay diligent
and keep our guard up.

235
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:21,541
We must fight onward!

236
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:23,958
Ah. You've got a point.

237
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:26,666
Since we're already
face-to-face.

238
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,458
We might as
well fight them.

239
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:34,416
Let me go after them.

240
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,875
May I, sir?

241
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,416
That which falls to rubble.

242
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,625
That which departs.

243
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:45,541
For now, I set
aside my sorrow.

244
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,666
To follow my path.

245
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,708
The one I have chosen.

246
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:57,333
Begone!

247
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:02,833
Shana!

248
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:03,791
Yuji!

249
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,833
If we're going to
go through with it,

250
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:13,416
we don't have a moment
to spare, Takemikazuchi.

251
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,666
I wholeheartedly agree,
Sophie Sawallisch.

252
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:17,833
Seriously?

253
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:19,625
You're actually
going to try it?

254
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:22,000
Yes. It's a last ditch effort

255
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:24,333
but I'm going to attempt to
destroy the Divine Gate.

256
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:25,875
Is it even possible?

257
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:27,791
We have to at least try!

258
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,291
Now that we know that
the Snake of the Festival

259
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:30,750
has been revived,

260
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:32,666
I'm afraid the odds are grim
that the four Flame Haze,

261
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,458
who followed him through
the gate, are safe.

262
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:38,500
Heavenly Father, I submit
myself to your authority

263
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:40,708
and claim your power.

264
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:43,416
I pray that you grant me
the strength and confidence

265
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,625
to lead my followers to victory.

266
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:48,875
Protect us and lead
us in thy grace.

267
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:50,125
Thy will be done.

268
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:12,208
Yuji, I'm going
to defeat you,

269
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:15,250
and if the God of Creation
tries to stand in my way,

270
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:17,291
I'll fight him, too.

271
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:18,625
Then you'll be free,

272
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:20,000
and we can start
creating a path

273
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:22,125
that we can
walk together.

274
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:24,708
Shana, if you still
think that's possible

275
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:26,958
after you've heard my
declaration of the Grand Order,

276
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:29,750
feel free to
challenge me again.

277
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:31,666
But I'm done for today.

278
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:34,666
Time's up.

279
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:38,041
Chigusa once told me

280
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:39,375
that when you
kiss another person

281
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:41,333
it's similar to a vow.

282
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,125
Shana.

283
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:46,625
I know it won't
happen today,

284
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:49,458
but that kiss is my
vow to conquer you.

285
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:52,458
There's no way
you can defeat me.

286
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:55,708
It's not whether I can,
it's that I will do it.

287
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:57,333
That's what makes it a vow!

288
00:21:57,416 --> 00:22:03,375
[Music]

289
00:22:42,291 --> 00:22:43,791
The moment of truth is here.

290
00:22:46,583 --> 00:22:49,166
My resurrection is complete!

291
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:55,041
[Music]

292
00:24:05,125 --> 00:24:07,666
You may be one step
closer to your goal

293
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:10,208
but I won't allow you
to make it a reality.

294
00:24:10,291 --> 00:24:11,416
I'll stop you.

295
00:24:14,458 --> 00:24:16,208
After his successful
resurrection,

296
00:24:16,291 --> 00:24:17,791
the Snake of the
Festival declares

297
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:20,791
he is ready to begin the final
stage of the Grand Order.

298
00:24:20,875 --> 00:24:24,083
This leaves the Flame Haze
shaken and forced to retreat.

299
00:24:24,166 --> 00:24:26,416
Next time on Shakugan
no Shana Final:

300
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,500
"Declaration of
the Grand Order."
