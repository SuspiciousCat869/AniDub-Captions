1
00:01:10,583 --> 00:01:11,958
Oh, thank goodness.

2
00:01:13,083 --> 00:01:15,208
I made it in time.

3
00:01:15,291 --> 00:01:17,583
Now there's only one
thing left to do.

4
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:20,875
Johann.

5
00:01:20,958 --> 00:01:23,708
I'm doing what
you asked of me.

6
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:25,416
No matter...

7
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,666
How much I don't want to.

8
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:32,000
But I will not
move further.

9
00:01:32,083 --> 00:01:35,250
Not without an
impossible miracle.

10
00:01:35,333 --> 00:01:36,791
It is...

11
00:01:36,875 --> 00:01:41,000
All that I can do to
resist someone so dear.

12
00:01:41,083 --> 00:01:46,791
[Music]

13
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:25,083
Preventing the God of
Creation's revival.

14
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:27,208
Capturing the
Palace of the Stars.

15
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:29,375
Destroying Bal
Masqué's leadership.

16
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:31,041
We indeed accomplished
none of it.

17
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:41,333
Look, we're almost there!

18
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:43,208
Hong Kong International!

19
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:45,625
I can't wait to see
Sophie and the others.

20
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:56,375
What's wrong
with you guys?

21
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:58,541
I've seen livelier
groups at a funeral!

22
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:01,958
Don'tcha wanna celebrate
us makin' our return to...

23
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:04,083
Would you show some
consideration for others?

24
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:05,916
Stupid Marco!

25
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,166
That's what I'm doin'!

26
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,083
Everyone's so
damn depressed,

27
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,916
I'm just tryin' to lighten
the mood a little b...

28
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,166
She must be quite
exhausted indeed.

29
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,666
Rest needed.

30
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:34,000
Yo!

31
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:37,083
Greetings. I'm glad you all
made it here as planned.

32
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:38,125
Good timing.

33
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:42,250
Yes, well.

34
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:43,916
How do the kids
put it these days?

35
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,250
We had our asses
handed to us.

36
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:52,708
Okay.

37
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:54,458
That is not the
rallying speech

38
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:56,666
I was expecting from
our fearless leader.

39
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,625
But the expression
does kind of fit.

40
00:04:58,708 --> 00:04:59,958
Got that right.

41
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:01,791
We just lost eighty
percent of our troops,

42
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:04,125
and among the survivors,
morale is zilch.

43
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:06,916
Things are as bad as the
look on the old man's face.

44
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,916
But Khamsin's face aside,

45
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,750
most people would say we're more
or less finished as an army.

46
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:15,458
Given all that,
you don't seem too upset.

47
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:17,125
Do you have a
counterattack plan?

48
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,291
Not even an inkling.

49
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:24,583
But we know what
we have to do.

50
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:27,291
We gave our word
to Centerhill.

51
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:29,375
We told him we would
continue to fight.

52
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:32,583
This isn't over yet.

53
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:39,083
We're not out of the game.

54
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:41,083
We still have
one card left.

55
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:49,708
That basically sums it up.

56
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,583
Yeah, I get it.

57
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:00,416
I wouldn't say that
it's the craziest plan

58
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,958
I've ever heard.

59
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:04,666
It's only like threadin'
a needle from a mile away.

60
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:08,208
Tryin' another long shot so
soon just seems desperate.

61
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:09,875
But not impossible.

62
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:11,958
We do have the
Scroll of Secrets

63
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:14,833
the Spiral Organ gave to the
Specialist of Everything.

64
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:22,708
I shall offer
you two things.

65
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:25,375
The first of which
being information.

66
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:28,041
And the second is...

67
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:29,708
The Snake of the Festival
insists that

68
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:31,125
with the creation of Xanadu

69
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:33,416
we will no longer have
any reason to fight.

70
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,666
Unfortunately, I can't say
that I'm quite as optimistic.

71
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,583
Especially not after
hearing the truth

72
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:40,458
revealed to us by Centerhill.

73
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:43,000
Damage to the world
does not occur simply

74
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:46,458
because Crimson Denizens
use Power of Existence.

75
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:49,791
It occurs because they
consume human souls,

76
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:52,375
making that Power of
Existence unstable.

77
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:54,625
Let's suppose it
goes as he claims,

78
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:57,625
that all the Denizens
follow him to paradise,

79
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:01,041
and the new world overflows
with Power of Existence.

80
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:04,083
If they act there the
same way they have here.

81
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:06,666
It's just delaying
the inevitable.

82
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:09,291
Sure, this world might be
protected for hundreds,

83
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:11,458
or even thousands of years.

84
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:13,666
But in the distant future,

85
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,416
not only this world,
but the new one,

86
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,708
and the Crimson World,

87
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:19,958
will be threatened
by a great cataclysm

88
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:21,458
that cannot be averted.

89
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:23,833
-Which is why I think...
-One moment.

90
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:25,666
You do understand
our forces

91
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,416
have suffered a crippling
defeat, don't you child?

92
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:32,708
That is why we are
attempting to explain...

93
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:34,541
It's not your plan
I'm worried about.

94
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:36,583
Only what is in
everyone's hearts.

95
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,916
Yes Shana, as you say,
we could go all-out,

96
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,041
fighting to protect
the world's balance.

97
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:45,666
It is, after all, our
primary task as Flame Hazes.

98
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:50,000
However, there are many
who view that task

99
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:52,625
as nothing more
than an excuse.

100
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:54,958
Which is why the words of
the Snake of the Festival,

101
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,333
Yuji Sakai,

102
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:59,500
were sufficient to send
the Flame Haze running.

103
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:01,500
Many Flame Haze
exist solely

104
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:03,791
to carry out personal
oaths of vengeance.

105
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:05,375
Forcing them to
fight for a world

106
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:08,750
that isn't even ours is
cruel, to say the least.

107
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:13,500
Of course.

108
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:17,541
I do not doubt the courage
of anyone in this room.

109
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:18,875
But I believe that,

110
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:21,000
in order for us to
determine our next course,

111
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,416
we must all look
inwards to find resolve,

112
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,750
rather than to
words of bravado.

113
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:31,083
Bear in mind, Headquarters has
yet to reach a formal decision,

114
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:33,541
which means we will most
likely be on our own

115
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:35,083
for any future battles.

116
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:38,916
I cannot guarantee we'll
receive any support from Outlaw.

117
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,875
Well, that's fine with me.

118
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,916
I ain't afraid of
handlin' things on my own.

119
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,208
I'm a big girl
so I don't need Outlaw

120
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,291
or anyone else to fight
my battles for me!

121
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:48,916
Slow down.

122
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,500
As the Supreme Commander said,

123
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:53,416
this is not a decision
to be taken lightly.

124
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,208
You can't just jump
into battle this time,

125
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:56,833
you need to think it over.

126
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:58,333
That being said,

127
00:08:58,416 --> 00:09:01,083
I'm afraid we don't have the
luxury of time on our side.

128
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,458
François has arranged a
charter flight for us

129
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:06,125
that will depart in
about four hours.

130
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:07,750
I would like you
to use this time

131
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:09,458
to think over everything
we've discussed

132
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:11,458
and consider your options.

133
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:13,958
Then, each one of you,
will have to make a choice.

134
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:16,750
You can either come with
us to fight, or stay here.

135
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:33,625
She's been thinking
this over for some time.

136
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:35,875
Abrupt announcement.

137
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:37,041
Indeed.

138
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:39,208
I now realize she's
been thinking about

139
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:40,916
our next move ever
since our defeat.

140
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,333
It was rather foolish
of me to assume

141
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:46,708
she was simply exhausted.

142
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:48,625
I thought the same.

143
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:50,666
I've taught her
since she was little.

144
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:54,583
We must always
fight for our cause.

145
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:56,666
This is what a
Flame Haze does.

146
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:00,000
I made sure it
was ingrained

147
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:02,083
into the very
core of her being.

148
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:03,416
For the sake of a friend

149
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,666
who sacrificed
herself to the cause.

150
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,791
And now when the cause
itself appears to waver,

151
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:16,791
indeed her commitment
is still firm.

152
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:18,625
This isn't over yet.

153
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:22,000
I wonder what gives
her that strength.

154
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:23,625
Yuji Sakai.

155
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:36,750
Margery!

156
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:41,958
Hey kiddo, you made it.

157
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,083
How's Heaven's Road?

158
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:44,708
François's there now.

159
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:46,583
It's moored
outside the city.

160
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:49,291
There's not a whole lot of
palace parking near the airport.

161
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:50,916
Smart thinkin' there.

162
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,958
Margery.

163
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:54,375
Shana just filled me in.

164
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:56,000
Have you decided
what you're gonna do?

165
00:10:58,208 --> 00:10:59,625
Are you gonna go
fight with her?

166
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:03,666
You don't know me
at all, do you?

167
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,375
Well, I thought I did.

168
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:07,583
What little devotion I
might've had to the cause,

169
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:09,375
I lost a long time ago.

170
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:11,166
So the midget's
rallying speech

171
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,625
really didn't
do much for me.

172
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:14,291
So then...

173
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:16,041
After everything
we've been through,

174
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:19,041
there's no way in hell I'm
backing out of this fight now.

175
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:20,833
What would be the point
of comin' all this way

176
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:22,750
if we weren't gonna
finish the job?

177
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:25,541
Gimme a break!

178
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:27,791
And you, Keisaku?

179
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:30,791
My decision's
never gonna change.

180
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:33,125
I'm with you to
the end, Margery.

181
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:34,791
You arrogant boy.

182
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,833
I wonder how the
young lady is faring.

183
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:44,750
Me, too. I hope she's safe.

184
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:47,500
Since you geezers
are still here,

185
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,083
I'm guessing it's
safe to assume

186
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,041
you've decided to
go with Nietono?

187
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:52,333
Of course.

188
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:53,958
Judging by your demeanor,

189
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:56,625
it's fairly obvious your
decision hasn't changed.

190
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:58,416
Thanks to a
certain someone,

191
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,375
my contractor is
all fired up now.

192
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:02,708
I wouldn't say "fired up".

193
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:04,791
But I did take a vow,

194
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:08,666
and I like to think that my word
is worth something at least.

195
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,791
I can respect that
point of view.

196
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:12,958
Call it instinct
or experience,

197
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:14,458
but if something sounds
too good to be true,

198
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:16,000
it usually is.

199
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:18,875
Especially in this case,
considering the source.

200
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:21,041
Forget about me, what
do the two of you think?

201
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:22,333
Ah, well.

202
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:24,791
If Shana's plan is the
one that is most likely

203
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:27,083
to achieve the
results we desire,

204
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:30,125
then I think we
should try it.

205
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:33,000
Now I can respect
that point of view!

206
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:34,500
But any way
you look at it,

207
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:37,750
we still lack the numbers
we will need for success.

208
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:39,750
Well, perhaps we
should start by praying

209
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:41,250
we don't lose any more.

210
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:47,000
Hey, Sale.

211
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:49,416
I think Shana's plan is
probably gonna be the best

212
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,833
for everyone involved.

213
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:54,041
We were told to decide
for ourselves, kid.

214
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:56,083
You don't need my
seal of approval.

215
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:57,375
Aw, come on.

216
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:59,083
How can you be so dense?

217
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:01,583
Can't you see she's worried
about being separated?

218
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:03,250
She wants to choose
the same path

219
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:05,041
so you guys don't
get split up.

220
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:07,458
No, I... I've already...

221
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:08,958
I've made my decision.

222
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:10,875
I was thoroughly
impressed with her plan

223
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:12,041
but that's to be expected

224
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,750
from the God of Atonement's
contractor.

225
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,833
Having the fate of the
world in our hands is scary

226
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:18,083
but also exhilarating!

227
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:19,041
Dontcha think?

228
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:24,916
I'm not motivated by revenge
like all the other Flame Haze,

229
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,958
'cause I was
artificially created.

230
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,125
But my dear old "dad"

231
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:32,583
is one of the bastards
who's behind this.

232
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:34,000
If I can keep that nutcase

233
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:36,583
from going to a world
full of Power of Existence,

234
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:38,291
then I got all
the reason I need

235
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:39,958
to get out there
and fight, you know?

236
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:49,583
Hurry up!

237
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:52,166
Quit fiddling
with that, Domino!

238
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,416
You can activate
the Crypta later!

239
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,291
Right now, though,
our one and only goal...

240
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:03,458
Is to get the blasted Palace
of the Stars up and flying!

241
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:05,666
What? But without the Crypta,

242
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:08,708
the Palace of the Stars will be
plainly visible, Professor...

243
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:09,916
Imbecile!

244
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,958
Don't you think I'm
aware of that, Domino?

245
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:15,916
But our first priority is
doing everything in our power

246
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,958
to keep Outlaw from
having time to plan!

247
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:22,166
Those were the orders
Bel-Peol gave us!

248
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,875
And they still stand!

249
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:27,083
Master, I'm told you have
another proclamation

250
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,125
for the Denizens?

251
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:29,333
I do.

252
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:31,708
The ceremony to create
the paradise Xanadu

253
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:33,708
shall take place in Japan.

254
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:35,458
And that will
be all for now.

255
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,000
That's rather vague

256
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:38,583
for an official proclamation,
don't you think?

257
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:40,250
I said that will be all.

258
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:41,500
Sir.

259
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:52,166
This is where you'll
perform the ceremony?

260
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:55,416
Yes it must be held here.

261
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,416
I would like to count
on your help in this,

262
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,875
Spiral Organ.

263
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:02,666
Will it involve something
beyond the undertaking

264
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,833
I was previously hired for?

265
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:08,666
That ring.

266
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:11,291
It belonged to
Friagne the Hunter.

267
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:12,875
It did.

268
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:14,333
What of it?

269
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:18,708
Nothing. I was merely thinking
how strange fate can be.

270
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,500
I want to thank you,
Supreme Commander.

271
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:24,250
For what, dear?

272
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:27,916
For reminding me I can't
just focus on my own task.

273
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,166
I have to consider
everyone else, as well.

274
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:32,916
I apologize for being
careless with my words.

275
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,750
I got caught up
in her enthusiasm.

276
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,750
Please forgive me.

277
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:39,041
It doesn't matter what
the others decide,

278
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:40,583
I am incredibly proud of you

279
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:43,041
for leading the charge
down a new path.

280
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:45,875
You hold your head high
instead of cowering in fear.

281
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:53,333
They have 'em in
Hong Kong, too!

282
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:54,583
My, my.

283
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:02,208
In all these years,
that smile hasn't changed.

284
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:03,791
This one tastes a
little different

285
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:05,458
than the ones
I get in Japan.

286
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:06,416
But the outside's
all crispy

287
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,541
and the inside's
all fluffy!

288
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:11,083
Tell me, Sophie Sawallisch.

289
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:14,208
While I imagine our
advice was rather helpful.

290
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:15,875
Do you think it
was really needed?

291
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:18,833
Well let's see,
Takemikazuchi.

292
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:20,625
If nothing else,
it gave me the courage

293
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:24,291
to carry out what
we're about to do.

294
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:26,708
Shana, let me ask
you something.

295
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:29,541
I've noticed you're
more comfortable

296
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:31,125
in your own skin now,

297
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:33,333
did my letter
help encourage you?

298
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:39,875
And Yuji had a lot
to do with it, too.

299
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:42,916
Very good.

300
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,916
Now that I know I don't
have to worry about you,

301
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,291
I should get back to Outlaw
headquarters in Zurich.

302
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:48,958
Why do you have to leave?

303
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,291
They have demanded
her presence there.

304
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:53,041
An emergency debriefing,

305
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:55,333
to discuss this
recent defeat.

306
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:57,875
The debriefing
is just pretext.

307
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:00,750
If you go, they'll simply
pin all the blame on you.

308
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:02,166
It's even possible...

309
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,791
That I will be relieved
of my command, yes.

310
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:05,958
Sophie!

311
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:07,750
Part of my job as
Supreme Commander

312
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:09,125
is taking responsibility

313
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:12,625
for all the failures
of those under me.

314
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:13,625
Come.

315
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:15,916
It's almost time to go.

316
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,416
And if I'm right,

317
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,541
none of the
other Flame Haze

318
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:20,125
will have the
sense to drop out.

319
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:22,125
They're as
stubborn as we are!

320
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,541
Yeah!

321
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:26,000
Yep. I'm taking a special
flight back tonight.

322
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:27,916
I took an extra
long vacation,

323
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,625
so we can finally have some
"together time" for once.

324
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:32,333
It's been quiet
around here.

325
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:34,541
I'm not sure if you'll
see Wilhelmina and Shana,

326
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:36,291
they've been gone
for some time.

327
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:38,000
Aw. That's too bad.

328
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:41,125
Guess it just means I'll
have you all to myself.

329
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:45,250
Well, you and the soon-to-be
newest member of the family.

330
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:48,250
And I am gonna spoil
my lovely wife rotten,

331
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,000
since I rarely
get the chance.

332
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:52,416
Ooh! I'm looking
forward to it.

333
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:05,208
Everyone has
indeed decided.

334
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:07,375
Even though all of their
reasons may differ.

335
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:09,083
Steadfast resolve.

336
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:11,083
With passion in
their hearts.

337
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:13,166
Every one of them
will move forward

338
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:16,000
as best they can.

339
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:18,625
I've lived to the fullest
for as long as I could.

340
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:19,666
Yes.

341
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,750
That's the answer
right there,

342
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:23,666
isn't it,
Mathilde Saint-Omer?

343
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:26,958
The child I...

344
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:29,125
no, that we raised.

345
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:32,666
She'll follow whatever
path she's decided on.

346
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,875
Let that be what
we fight for.

347
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:58,208
They're gonna make that
paradise in Japan, huh?

348
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:05,458
Get this, I got a request for
help from Bal Masqué yesterday.

349
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:08,541
Who knows how the heck they
found us all the way out here.

350
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:10,750
Well,. I'm sure they're trying
to round up as many pawns

351
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:12,708
as they can get their
scheming hands on.

352
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:16,250
Got no problem using
others as pawns

353
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:18,333
but I don't really dig
it the other way around.

354
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:19,875
Obviously.

355
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:21,458
Aren't you worried?

356
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:24,333
They're gonna get pissed if we
keep ignoring them, boss-man.

357
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:27,041
You think I give a crap
about their gods or Xanadu?

358
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:28,416
It ain't exactly paradise

359
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,583
if you gotta work
so hard to get it.

360
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:32,208
Hell, I'm content
to sit in the sun

361
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:35,333
and enjoy a hot cup o'
joe with some friends.

362
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:37,833
That's us: cheap,
relaxed, and simple.

363
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:40,041
What need have we
for gods, right?

364
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:45,833
Good morning everyone!

365
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:47,166
Hey, Louie. Thanks.

366
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,708
Here ya go.

367
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:54,916
I've found you.

368
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,291
Though I wish I hadn't.

369
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:15,916
Listen everyone,

370
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,250
I want you all to go out

371
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:19,750
and fight to the best
of your abilities.

372
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:21,500
Unfortunately, we'll be
getting a lecture in Zurich

373
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:22,708
and cannot join you.

374
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:24,708
So please do some
damage for us.

375
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:26,541
You can count on me.

376
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,208
I just gotta act natural,

377
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:30,458
and waltz right inside
the Heaven's Road Palace.

378
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:33,416
Be sure to give us
the exact timing,

379
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,416
once the plan's
schedule is decided.

380
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,666
If you could, please tell
François I said hello.

381
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:47,208
Well, we've got a long,
hard road ahead of us.

382
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:48,958
We have to travel
halfway around the world

383
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:51,541
and then right back again.

384
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,708
Here's hopin' we'll have
three more folks with us

385
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:55,458
when we make the
journey back.

386
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:57,333
It is arranged.

387
00:20:57,416 --> 00:21:00,625
A meeting with the three
remaining Gods of the Earth

388
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:02,041
indeed awaits
you in New York.

389
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:03,500
Ah, yes.

390
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:04,583
With their assistance,

391
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:06,416
everything we will
have to do next

392
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,500
should proceed a
lot more smoothly.

393
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:11,916
But whether or not they'll
agree to fight at our side

394
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,958
is still a big question.

395
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:15,541
Difficult battle.

396
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:17,958
Stressing out about
it won't help.

397
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:20,333
We'll just have to
talk to them and see.

398
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:21,625
You make a good point.

399
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:23,791
Especially in their case.

400
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:26,625
And it's not that they
aren't good people.

401
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:29,416
But the fact that Centerhill
is the easiest to deal with

402
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,500
tells you something.

403
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:32,125
I'm not looking
forward to it,

404
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:34,375
-but there's no choice.
-Yes.

405
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:36,583
On to New York.

406
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:39,541
I'll pass along to the
remaining Gods of the Earth

407
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:41,750
the words that
Centerhill left behind.

408
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,708

409
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,291
Reignition is a success!

410
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:17,916
We are cookin' with gas!

411
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,666
Congratulations,
Professor!

412
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:24,750
Master.

413
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:26,541
Give the Palace her heading.

414
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:31,000
We'll go northeast!

415
00:22:33,375 --> 00:22:34,500
On to Japan.

416
00:22:34,583 --> 00:22:36,166
To Misaki City.

417
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:41,875
Yuji.

418
00:22:41,958 --> 00:22:43,166
I will find you.

[Music]

420
00:24:14,875 --> 00:24:16,666
Shana and the others
head to New York

421
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,375
to meet with the three
remaining Gods of the Earth

422
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:19,750
and ask for their help.

423
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:21,583
Meanwhile, back
in Misaki City,

424
00:24:21,666 --> 00:24:24,916
Yuji appears before Yoshida
and Tanaka one last time.

425
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,250
Next time, on Shakugan
no Shana Final.

426
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:28,291
"For Whose Sake?"
