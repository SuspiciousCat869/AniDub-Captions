1
00:00:54,416 --> 00:00:56,583
You're no longer... needed.

2
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:05,041
[Music]

3
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:35,958
Outstanding work, Priestess.

4
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:37,416
Thanks to you,

5
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,458
the Palace has reached
the exact coordinates.

6
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:42,916
What makes this
spot special?

7
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,291
If you're trying to
collect intelligence...

8
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:49,125
you should really try being more
discreet about it, you know?

9
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:50,541
Indeed...

10
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:52,750
but we've nothing
to hide from him...

11
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:55,541
this is where I will
create a gate to the Abyss.

12
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:57,208
Futile...!

13
00:02:57,291 --> 00:02:59,458
Your spirit may
have found refuge

14
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:01,500
but your body is
lost for eternity!

15
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:03,208
Accept it!

16
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:06,083
No one is capable of escaping
banishment to the Abyss!

17
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:08,583
Not even you,
God of Creation.

18
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:10,708
So... naive.

19
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:12,750
You should not
take me lightly...

20
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:14,916
nor the resolve of
those who follow me.

21
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,166
My loyal servants and
I have gathered here

22
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,416
in the hopes of reshaping
this world for the better...

23
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,833
To do so,

24
00:03:20,916 --> 00:03:24,375
we will enact a plan
set in motion millennia ago.

25
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:26,333
As I was swallowed
by the Abyss,

26
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:29,083
the Strategist sent
me the Insignia,

27
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:32,791
a piece of her existence
that would be my salvation.

28
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:43,166
Well, if I'm not needed,
then just let me go!

29
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:46,291
Sydonay finds your
presence to be amusing,.

30
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:49,875
but nonetheless essential to
Bal Masque's overall objective.

31
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,833
For now, Bel-Peol appears

32
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:54,583
to be of the same
school of thought...

33
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:55,958
And even though
she is aware

34
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:58,083
of our master's
fascination with you...

35
00:03:58,166 --> 00:03:59,416
she is bound and determined

36
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,291
to keep it from
affecting our operation.

37
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:09,000
She's attacking without
casting a Seal...

38
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:10,791
My opinion, however...

39
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:13,833
is that you are
wholly unnecessary...

40
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:16,666
Especially in regard to
the master's Grand Order!

41
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:20,916
In fact... I feel you are a
threat to its very existence!

42
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,458
No way...

43
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:24,250
she's here of her
own accord...?

44
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:30,750
Now... be gone!

45
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:38,583
I communicated with the
Priestess through the Insignia.

46
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:41,000
After years of
meticulous work,

47
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:44,125
she ultimately succeeded in
creating an Unrestricted Spell

48
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:47,541
that would be capable
of enforcing my will.

49
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:50,541
Yes, it's the spell you
know as the Taimei Shihen

50
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:53,541
The Psalm of the
Grand Order...

51
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:56,833
My servant's set upon the
task of creating a vessel...

52
00:04:56,916 --> 00:04:59,583
while I forged a path
through the Abyss...

53
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:03,541
Eventually, the vessel would
wield my power in this world,

54
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:07,291
and create a gateway
leading back to that path.

55
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:09,875
Despite thousands of years
and countless setbacks,

56
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:12,375
the Snake remained
patient in his prison...

57
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:14,583
until a suitable vessel
was finally found.

58
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:16,125
So once you form this gate,

59
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:17,583
you intend to
travel the path,

60
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:20,000
and reclaim your
original body?

61
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:21,666
Precisely, so.

62
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,083
Divine Gate...

63
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:24,750
I command you to...

64
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:25,750
open!

65
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:30,333
We've come here...

66
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:32,041
because these coordinates

67
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:34,416
are the closest to my
body's resting place...

68
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,458
Once the gate has
materialized...

69
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:39,791
I will finally be able
to reclaim what is mine.

70
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:52,875
It is done.

71
00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:59,666
Now that the gate
has been opened...

72
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,250
the Grand Order will
soon come to fruition.

73
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:12,583
Your flame shall extinguish...

74
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:14,083
by my hand!

75
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:34,541
You!

76
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:40,000
You've surprised me.

77
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:41,083
Sorry...

78
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:43,000
Master.

79
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:44,791
But I did so for you...!

80
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:46,666
Her mere presence is toxic...

81
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,750
and is a threat to
the Grand Order!

82
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,500
This girl is the avatar
of the god slayer,

83
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:54,083
the dark God of Atonement...

84
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:56,333
For your sake;
for the order's sake...

85
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,958
I implore you, Master,
destroy this Flame Haze!

86
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:01,875
Her disdain for you
is nearly palpable...

87
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:03,625
isn't it, Flame of Heaven?

88
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:06,333
My loyal Priestess...

89
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:08,875
I applaud you for
your forward thinking.

90
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:11,333
However... you've
clearly underestimated

91
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:13,916
the worth of this Flame Haze.

92
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,791
Did you ever stop to
consider my motives

93
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:18,583
for capturing the Flaming-
Haired Blazing-Eyed Hunter?

94
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:20,791
While the feelings
of Yuji Sakai...

95
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:23,458
may well have played
a trivial role...

96
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:25,583
they alone did
not sway me.

97
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:28,416
Let's say I was to
do as you suggest

98
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,208
and kill her right here....

99
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:32,458
What would happen?

100
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:36,125
It's possible that,
in a fit of rage...

101
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:38,791
the Flame of Heaven would
launch a last ditch attack...

102
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,875
and attempt to reduce
me to smoldering ash

103
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:42,583
in the few seconds
available to him.

104
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:46,083
But he won't...

105
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:49,166
such an act is far too brash
for a Lord of his standards...

106
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,750
All of that power,

107
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:54,166
yet he remains willingly bound
to his rules and principles...

108
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,750
regardless of the cost.

109
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:58,500
If Shana's life were to end,

110
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:00,000
he would return to
the Crimson World

111
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:02,041
to forge another contract.

112
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:03,750
Then, at the worst
possible moment,

113
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:05,625
he would appear with
his new Flame Haze

114
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:07,833
and perform the Tenpa Jousai.

115
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:09,000
Can you see, now,

116
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:10,750
why the presence
of this contractor

117
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:13,250
is such a blessing,
Priestess...?

118
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:16,041
It would be an utter waste of
good fortune to kill her...

119
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:18,541
As long as we continue
to have her restricted...

120
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:19,958
we've, effectively,

121
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,166
put a leash on the God
of Atonement as well.

122
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:32,583
Oh my...

123
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:35,708
it appears that you've made
quite a mess of things, Hecate.

124
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:43,875
So, this is how it feels
to realize ones' destiny!

125
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:45,208
All I had to do was ask

126
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,083
and then the work
was done for me...!

127
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:48,625
How exhilarating!

128
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:50,708
A little more time,

129
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:53,583
and my wish will no longer
be out of arm's reach.

130
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,041
I can't believe Margery had
to go overseas on business!

131
00:08:58,125 --> 00:08:58,958
That's a bummer.

132
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:02,458
I was hoping we could
have another study fest,

133
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:04,375
but I guess that's
totally shot.

134
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:07,583
Have any idea where Tanaka and
Sato have been hiding lately...?

135
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:10,416
You'd think they'd
at least call me.

136
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,625
Uh-uh.

137
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:13,500
Well, it's all good...

138
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:16,791
it'll be a nonstop party when
the gang gets back together.

139
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:20,625
I sure hope so!

140
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:27,291
Will the gang
hang out again?

141
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:30,750
I appreciate all that Shana has
done to protect this place...

142
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:33,041
and, I know that somewhere,

143
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:34,958
Sakai is trying
to do the same...

144
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:40,625
But... why've I
been left behind?

145
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:42,375
There must be
something I can do...

146
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:58,375
Fascinating, the base concept
is really quite simple.

147
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:00,125
Dantalion...

148
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:01,458
If it's not too imposing,

149
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:03,708
I'd like to tamper
with the material here.

150
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:05,458
No, tamper away...!

151
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:07,541
I have a backup
in the Conloquim,

152
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:08,791
so as far as I'm concerned,

153
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:10,500
you can fiddle with it
to your heart's content.

154
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:11,750
Go ahead buddy!

155
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:15,791
Thank you for your
enthusiastic generosity.

156
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:22,625
This is a first, you seem
thoroughly unsettled.

157
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:24,458
I hate to be the
bearer of bad news...

158
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,166
but it seems
there's discord

159
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,208
among the collective magics.

160
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:30,083
If what I'm
sensing is correct,

161
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:33,083
the "Absorption" spell has been
active for quite some time;

162
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:35,083
even before unification.

163
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:36,375
What?!

164
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:37,958
The only being who
would've required

165
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:41,750
such an Unrestricted Spell
was the second Tyrant...

166
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:44,791
to gather emotional fragments
to form its personality...

167
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:47,583
Unless you can
think of another?

168
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:49,125
Brilliant deduction!

169
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:51,500
However, you mustn't forget
the two Tyrants function

170
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:53,291
as a single unit!

171
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:54,541
For compatibility's sake,

172
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:56,541
the same spells that
gave life to the second,

173
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:57,916
are embedded in the first,

174
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,625
which Sabrac put inside
the Midnight Lost Child.

175
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:01,958
Well that's funny...

176
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:04,750
I made sure to deactivate
the "Absorption" function

177
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:07,041
and yet... it impatiently
decided to power up

178
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,500
all by itself!

179
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:10,958
I don't suppose you
have any theories

180
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:13,375
on what may have caused
this grievous error?

181
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:14,500
I'm not certain...

182
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:16,250
but I would speculate
this distortion

183
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:18,375
was caused by
exposure to the Keeper

184
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:21,166
that was placed on the
Midnight Lost Child.

185
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,041
I'll take the time
to look into this

186
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:25,541
while I'm investigating
your other concerns,

187
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:28,333
regarding the instability
of the Treasure Tool.

188
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:35,375
I can't remember the last time
you came drinking with us...

189
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:36,666
How long's it been?

190
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,125
Couldn't tell ya...

191
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:40,791
been a helluva long time,
that's for sure.

192
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:45,666
Long enough to forget
how bad the drinks are!

193
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:52,750
Their excitement's
infectious...

194
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:56,708
And so is their anxiety...

195
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:59,750
S'pose it's to be expected
before going to war.

196
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:01,000
Can't blame 'em.

197
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:05,625
Sorry fellas...

198
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:07,000
When you go into battle,

199
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:09,833
I won't be there to
fight alongside you.

200
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:11,541
Forgiveness isn't needed...

201
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:12,916
if the General is absent,

202
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,791
the battlefield shall
shake in his honor!

203
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:17,916
As you journey to
that forsaken place,

204
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,375
rest assured your men will
fight to the bitter end.

205
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:21,583
We commend your bravery

206
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:24,000
for accompanying the
master into the Abyss...

207
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:26,125
If only you could bring
along your army...

208
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:28,083
we would gladly
follow you.

209
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:30,416
The sword should not be
concerned with the shield...

210
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,250
for they have both
been forged by fate

211
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:34,958
and are guided with resolution
towards their common goal...

212
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:36,458
Should the shield fall...

213
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:37,916
It will fall with honor

214
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,083
and drag the enemy,
screaming, down with it.

215
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,916
Yes, General Sydonay...?

216
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:52,625
No one can predict what might
happen in times of war...

217
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:54,250
The tides can change
at any moment,

218
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:55,916
so stay vigilant.

219
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,458
You've not told me anything
I don't already know...

220
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:01,958
As long as I'm in command,
I foresee no problems.

221
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:04,166
Take care of my men
and there won't be.

222
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,875
The strategy is simple,

223
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:08,666
offensive on the front and
defensive in reserve...

224
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:12,625
Both your soldiers and the
Palace shall be well protected.

225
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,916
I'll hold you to that...

226
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,416
you better not let
me down, Decarabia.

227
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:27,916
Ah... I've been informed of

228
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,125
what happened after we
last saw each other...

229
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:31,750
You have my condolences.

230
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:35,208
If it would comfort you...

231
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:37,958
we could deliver a message to
the Specialist of Everything

232
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:39,500
when we rendezvous with her.

233
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:42,500
No, that's okay...

234
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:44,041
thank you though.

235
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:46,708
Well, if you're
sure about it.

236
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:49,291
Perhaps it was
rude of me to ask?

237
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:51,625
You realize that, in order
to defeat their leader,

238
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:54,250
Yuji Sakai has to
fall as well...

239
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,166
Doesn't that bother you?

240
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,625
I must admit,

241
00:13:57,708 --> 00:14:00,333
I expected you would implore
us to save the Mystes.

242
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:04,583
I don't have any right
to request that...

243
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:06,833
So many Flame Haze are
about to risk their lives

244
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:08,666
to protect this world...

245
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:12,041
and defeating Sakai is the
quickest way to do that.

246
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:13,458
So...

247
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:16,708
it would be selfish to put
my feelings before that.

248
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:19,625
Also... back at the
Crystal Altar...

249
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:22,416
when he said
goodbye to me...

250
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,083
I think it was him ...

251
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:25,916
No, I'm sure of it!

252
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,041
It was Sakai...

253
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:28,958
not Snake, talking to me...

254
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:30,875
I know he's still in
there somewhere...

255
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:32,500
He may even be
there willingly,

256
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:34,833
and if that happens
to be the case...

257
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:36,625
He doesn't need me...

258
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:38,250
And the most arrogant
thing I could do

259
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:40,250
would be to interfere.

260
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:43,000
Ah... Very well said.

261
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:45,416
Forgive us, we did
not mean to pry.

262
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:50,416
I can't help feeling
we underestimated her.

263
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,083
It would seem so...

264
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:54,625
Humans are certainly full
of surprises, aren't they?

265
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:55,791
Khamsin?

266
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:56,750
Behemoth?

267
00:14:58,291 --> 00:14:59,666
I could really
use your help...

268
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,333
If you have a
moment to spare.

269
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:02,625
Ah...

270
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:03,875
How can we help you?

271
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:06,333
I have a question about
this Treasure Tool.

272
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:13,041
May I come in...

273
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:14,083
Shana?

274
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:22,291
Have you recovered
from earlier?

275
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:23,666
Yes... I'm fine.

276
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:26,291
Beautiful.

277
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:32,916
Shana...

278
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,208
Come with me, please.

279
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:36,125
Where are we going?

280
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:37,750
Up the stairs,
for starters.

281
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:47,916
I want you by my side

282
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,291
to witness the start
of this great journey.

283
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:51,458
Journey to where?

284
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:53,250
Towards destiny...

285
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:56,166
The time has come to retrieve
the God of Creation's body

286
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,125
from the Abyss.

287
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:00,500
What's going to happen once
he's accomplished that goal...

288
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:01,958
and he has no use for you?

289
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:03,166
Don't worry...

290
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,750
It's true Yuji Sakai

291
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:06,916
is the bearer of the
Midnight Lost Child...

292
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,416
But, understand...

293
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,625
if his worth ended there I
would not have chosen him...

294
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:13,166
to be the vessel
of my true will.

295
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:15,250
I've no intention
of discarding him...

296
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:17,666
You needn't be concerned
for his well-being.

297
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,458
Oh, and Shana...

298
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:21,583
I have no intention
of sacrificing myself

299
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:22,958
for the world...

300
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:24,500
so don't worry.

301
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:27,375
I'm following this path so
I can protect everyone...

302
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:29,083
and so that we
can be together.

303
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:36,291
Those... are my
heart's... desires.

304
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:41,208
I don't understand why
Pheles gave this to me.

305
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:43,083
It seems so selfish
of a Flame Haze

306
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:45,750
to ask a human to
bear this burden.

307
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:47,375
Shana did
everything she could

308
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:49,083
to help Pheles rescue Johann

309
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:50,958
from the Midnight Lost Child.

310
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:52,583
And I was supposed
to use this

311
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:54,541
if it ever came
into jeopardy...

312
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:56,041
However...

313
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:59,291
If I did use it, it'd
deplete my Power of Existence

314
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:02,083
and I'd lose all hope
of being with Sakai.

315
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:03,666
On the other hand,

316
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,958
if it turned out that Sakai was
in love with someone else...

317
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:07,875
The sorrow would wash
away the feelings

318
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:11,000
I'd need to even utilize it.

319
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:12,666
Pheles knew this...

320
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,750
and yet, she gave
it to me anyway.

321
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:17,875
Ah... I understand.

322
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:20,250
You wish to know why the
Caprice of Beauty entrusted you

323
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:23,041
with an item meant to
safeguard the Eternal Lover.

324
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,250
Especially if the risk

325
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:27,083
of you being unable
to use it was so high.

326
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:29,625
Yes... I'm so confused...

327
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:30,708
I don't know...

328
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:33,458
what was behind
her reasoning.

329
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:35,458
With the way things
are right now...

330
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:37,500
I doubt I'd ever be able
to make this work...

331
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:38,916
And it's not...

332
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,416
because I'm afraid of
disappearing or anything...

333
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,291
Though the thought isn't
really a pleasant one.

334
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:46,333
It's because I know...

335
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:48,583
that Sakai's path
to happiness...

336
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:50,750
has turned so far
away from mine,

337
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:53,833
they will never
come together again.

338
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:56,375
All I wanted was to
share joy with him...

339
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:58,708
and even though I know
that can't happen...

340
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:02,041
I suggest you go
home, Yoshida.

341
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:04,833
There's no way I
can turn back now!

342
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:06,416
Whether I like
it or not...

343
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,500
the reason that
I am here...

344
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:10,416
is because of the
choices that I've made,

345
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,500
and no one else can take
responsibility for them!

346
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:16,083
Especially not Sakai!

347
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:17,875
I want to help,
but to do that,

348
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:19,833
I need you to
help me understand

349
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:21,750
why Pheles gave this
Treasure Tool to me.

350
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:25,458
Human beings truly are

351
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:28,750
beautiful and mysterious
creatures aren't they, Behemoth?

352
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:30,666
Indeed, Khamsin Nbh'w...

353
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,000
And that is
just one reason

354
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:35,916
our constant struggle
has so much meaning.

355
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,208
Alright... I'll do
what I can to help you...

356
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:39,333
But, I'll warn you...

357
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:41,708
this story won't
be easy to hear.

358
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:43,416
A long time ago...

359
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,541
in a kingdom
of burning sands,

360
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:48,916
there was a Prince who
possessed unnatural talent.

361
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,250
One day, a monster who
fed on Power of Existence

362
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:54,583
came to his country.

363
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,875
In order to defend
his beloved King,

364
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:59,208
the Prince
challenged the beast.

365
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:01,375
He used every ounce
of skill and power

366
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:02,666
he had in the fight...

367
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:03,750
Though he knew full well

368
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:06,875
the King he fought
for despised him.

369
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:09,208
Unfortunately,
the Prince lost...

370
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:11,958
And as he lay there, about
to be consumed by the monster,

371
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:14,666
a strange voice called
out from the heavens.

372
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:18,291
"If you will abandon
your human existence

373
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:20,625
and become my vessel,"
it said...

374
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:23,958
"I will grant you
unimaginable power."

375
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:25,791
The Prince accepted
the offer,

376
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:27,875
and drove the monster away.

377
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:30,791
But, the power he had
received came at a cost.

378
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:32,666
After risking his
life for the King

379
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,125
and the people
of his country,

380
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:37,916
not one of them could
even remember him.

381
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,625
That was what it meant to
abandon one's existence;

382
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:42,541
everything he'd
ever loved was lost.

383
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:44,500
With nothing left
to call his own,

384
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:47,291
the Prince set out in
search of the monster.

385
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:48,791
Hundreds of years passed

386
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:51,166
until the Prince finally
tracked down the beast.

387
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:53,291
It was such a cruel
irony that he hunted

388
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:55,541
the only being who
remembered who he was.

389
00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:58,833
The Prince hated
the monster;

390
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:00,791
he blamed it for
everything he'd lost.

391
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:02,958
But after chasing
it for so long,

392
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:05,625
he'd come to love the beast
for giving him a purpose

393
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:07,291
and the creature
loved him in return

394
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:08,875
for granting it the same.

395
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,250
I don't understand...

396
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:14,458
The Prince slew the beast
as it lay in his arms.

397
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:16,333
It in turn,
inflicted a deep,

398
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:18,625
but not quite fatal,
wound on him.

399
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:20,541
Both regretted
their actions,

400
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:23,625
but knew it was
their destiny.

401
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:26,291
In the end, the pair
was heartbroken.

402
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:29,708
The same fate that had once
guided the hunter to his prey

403
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:32,833
now forced them to be torn
away from one another.

404
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:35,458
So, in defiance
of that fate...

405
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:37,625
They united in death.

406
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:40,833
Though tragic,
that was love...

407
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:42,875
And, while lovers may
come to curse, hate,

408
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:44,250
or even kill each other,

409
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:47,375
their bond is eternal
and never fades away.

410
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:49,666
An affection that
grows too strong...

411
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,500
may make those
outcomes inevitable.

412
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:56,583
Love is never as simple...

413
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:58,458
as sharing the same path.

414
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,791
Good evening, Master...

415
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:05,458
Your faithful subjects
await your word.

416
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:06,666
Very well.

417
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:10,166
So many Denizens...!

418
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:14,958
Are your hearts
ablaze with pride?!

419
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:17,083
Are your bodies
trembling with glory?!

420
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:19,958
Then you are destined to
walk this path with me!

421
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:22,291
Due to your diligence...
and courage...

422
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:24,375
I have returned to
fulfill the Grand Order.

423
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,083
Through this Divine Gate...

424
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:30,583
my body is bound
in chaos...

425
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:32,416
I plan to shatter
it's chains,

426
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,875
and finally reclaim what
rightfully belongs to me,

427
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:36,291
the God of Creation...

428
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:37,958
the Snake of the Festival!

429
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:42,708
While you remain here,
I task you!

430
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:44,166
Guard the Palace
of the Stars...

431
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:46,750
until I can return
here with the Trinity!

432
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:48,500
Let your gleaming
blades and claws

433
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:50,166
be as sharp as your wits!

434
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:52,666
Let that burning pride
scorch your foes,

435
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:55,125
and may the bellowing howls
be heralds of your wrath

436
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:56,291
as you call to them...

437
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:57,750
"No more!"...

438
00:21:57,833 --> 00:22:00,166
Give no quarter, for you
will be shown no mercy!

439
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,375
Prove to the enemy
that you exist...!

440
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:04,500
Remember... you fight...

441
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:06,125
for the future!

442
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:08,750
From your courage...

443
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:10,958
I will be able to reach
the final stage...

444
00:22:11,041 --> 00:22:13,041
of our glorious
Grand Order!

445
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:15,291
And then, I will
change the world...

446
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:16,583
I swear it!

447
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:30,958
Don't worry...
I'll return.

448
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:35,541
And when I do,
I'll show you...

449
00:22:35,625 --> 00:22:38,291
As well as the
entire world...

450
00:22:38,375 --> 00:22:40,208
My desire for change!

451
00:22:43,541 --> 00:22:49,500
[Music]

452
00:24:14,291 --> 00:24:15,958
In an attempt to
rescue Shana,

453
00:24:16,041 --> 00:24:17,750
Wilhelmina raises
Heaven's Road Palace

454
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:19,458
from its watery grave.

455
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:21,500
Meanwhile, Supreme Commander
Sophie Sawallisch,

456
00:24:21,583 --> 00:24:23,541
sets her own plan
into motion.

457
00:24:23,625 --> 00:24:26,083
Next time on Shakugan
no Shana: Final;

458
00:24:26,166 --> 00:24:27,791
"The War Begins."
