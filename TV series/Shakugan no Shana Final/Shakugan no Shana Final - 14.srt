1
00:01:18,291 --> 00:01:20,000
He's here!

2
00:01:31,166 --> 00:01:33,625
You may be one step
closer to your goal

3
00:01:33,708 --> 00:01:36,208
but I won't allow you
to make it a reality.

4
00:01:36,291 --> 00:01:37,833
I will stop you.

5
00:01:37,916 --> 00:01:43,625
[Music]

6
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:16,000
It's magnificent!

7
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:19,916
It is the master.

8
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:23,583
Our god.

9
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:37,791
Did your eyes feast on
the glorious triumph

10
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:40,708
you helped ensure,
Tempest Hoof, Fecor?

11
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:42,291
I can only hope.

12
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:47,750
It's time.

13
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:49,458
Prepare to bear witness.

14
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:54,833
As our god declares
his Grand Order!

15
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:01,583
Look to me!

16
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:10,166
You gaze upon divinity
in its purest form!

17
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,833
Rejoice in your
good fortune.

18
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:15,958
Set aside your fears.

19
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:19,416
My loyal servants,

20
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,541
the moment of
truth is upon us.

21
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:23,041
My heart and my power

22
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:25,833
have been restored to
their former glory.

23
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:31,833
You shall be rewarded
for your service.

24
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:35,166
I now declare the
Grand Order's final stage!

25
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:38,208
The end of a task
which began eons ago!

26
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:40,833
It is thus...

27
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:43,625
...in the rift between worlds,
I will create...

28
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:45,833
A paradise called Xanadu!

29
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:52,291
Xanadu?

30
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:55,750
This world will be the sum of
your desires made manifest.

31
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:57,041
Its sole purpose

32
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:59,500
will be to welcome and
provide for all Denizens

33
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:02,625
who reside in its embrace.

34
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:04,833
Some of you were
there millennia ago

35
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:07,416
when I first
attempted this feat.

36
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,333
I nearly succeeded
in its creation

37
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:11,708
but the Ancient Flame Haze

38
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:13,625
that I had invited in amity

39
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:16,541
decided to seal me
inside the Abyss.

40
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:21,750
After eons of aimless wandering,
I came to an epiphany.

41
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:26,500
I now know where this
utopia is destined to be born!

42
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:29,041
That fated place

43
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:32,208
is the very prison to
which I was banished!

44
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:36,791
What's more, as I
reshaped the Grand Order

45
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:40,125
the true form of our
paradise became clear.

46
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:42,958
It must not be hidden in a
small pocket of this world

47
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:45,416
for my Denizens
deserve better.

48
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,291
Instead, I will duplicate
the whole of creation!

49
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:49,750
That's my gift.

50
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:52,750
A complete world
that is only for you!

51
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:54,958
Everything you know
will be part of it,

52
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:57,916
and new life will spring
from its fertile womb!

53
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,208
That is Xanadu!

54
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:02,708
A sanctuary where
Power of Existence

55
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:04,875
flows inexorably and eternally!

56
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:09,083
It's within your grasp,
my loyal servants.

57
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:13,166
Nothing will keep me from making
the Grand Order a reality!

58
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,916
Finally, I will have
answered your prayers

59
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,291
and fulfilled my role
as God of Creation!

60
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:41,500
Uh. Hey, Balar, you
care to summarize?

61
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:44,000
The Snake of the Festival
plans to replicate this world

62
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:45,416
within the rift.

63
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:49,083
Thereby creating a proverbial
paradise for Denizens.

64
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:51,375
That would be an abomination!

65
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:53,250
Focus now.

66
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:54,291
This is bad.

67
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:55,791
Look at all the Denizens!

68
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:07,458
The declaration sent
them into a frenzy.

69
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:09,041
We lost this battle

70
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:11,625
when we failed to prevent the
God of Creation's revival.

71
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:13,625
Attempting to
salvage this fight,

72
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:16,125
would only result in a
needless loss of life.

73
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:17,416
Supreme Commander!

74
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,958
We're getting slaughtered!

75
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:20,625
What do you want us to do?

76
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:30,583
I don't know if those
were Yuji's words

77
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:32,666
or the Snake of
the Festival's.

78
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,291
We can't be certain.

79
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:37,125
Either way, our current
predicament is the same.

80
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:40,791
Caution, it seems, has
become our greatest ally.

81
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:42,875
Well, we can't do much
to help from up here,

82
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:45,583
so what's the plan?

83
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,916
Perhaps we should withdraw?

84
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,041
Ah.

85
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:50,875
We need a clear view
of the situation.

86
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:52,083
I suggest we head back

87
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:54,041
and consult with Supreme
Commander Sawallisch

88
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:55,750
in order to form
an exit strategy.

89
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:02,416
We've managed to gather

90
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,708
all remaining troops
to this location,

91
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:07,583
save the ones fighting
on the plains.

92
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:10,750
I assume you're well aware
of our forces' current status?

93
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:12,291
Indeed.

94
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:13,833
To say that we're
at a disadvantage

95
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:16,125
would be a grave
understatement at this point.

96
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:20,083
Yes, it certainly was quite
an embarrassing outcome,

97
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:23,250
but retreating is the last
option available to us.

98
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:25,083
If it's our last,
then it is our best;

99
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:28,000
regardless of how
humiliating it may be.

100
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:29,750
Pride is irrelevant now.

101
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:34,791
So then.

102
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:37,333
You've settled on withdrawing
from the battlefield.

103
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:38,791
But do you
completely understand

104
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:41,375
the gravity of
that decision?

105
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:43,458
Safely pulling out
such a small force

106
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:45,333
will not be an easy task.

107
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:48,208
Perhaps you have
a plan, then?

108
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:51,458
Centerhill, the Beckoner
of Brightened Dew,

109
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:54,250
has finally offered
his opinion.

110
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:57,458
Is it possible
this is a sign

111
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:58,833
that we can
expect assistance

112
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:01,250
from the Four Gods
of the Earth?

113
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:02,583
No.

114
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:05,166
He's yet to make a choice.

115
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,166
Yes, we understand

116
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,208
and we've prepared
a contingency plan

117
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:12,250
in case matters turn dire.

118
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:14,916
This operation has
been designated "Ebb".

119
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,750
Our main objective
will be this waypoint.

120
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:20,666
To the east, where
Heaven's Road Palace is hidden.

121
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:24,916
The best case scenario

122
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,458
would be for all forces
to rendezvous there.

123
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:30,375
It would serve as a mobile
shelter and ensure our escape.

124
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:32,458
It's a decent plan,
but it's flawed.

125
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:35,125
The objective isn't
exactly nearby.

126
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:37,583
In addition to that,
we'll have to make it there

127
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:40,791
while engaging enemy
forces in a running battle.

128
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:43,125
Then somebody's gonna
have to stay behind.

129
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,500
We'll need a unit dedicated
to making life hell

130
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:48,208
for the Denizens that try
to pursue us from the west.

131
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:49,875
Leave that to me.

132
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:52,166
My squad is already
in prime position

133
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:55,083
for covering a retreat.

134
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:57,625
You can start making your
way to Heaven's Road Palace,

135
00:09:57,708 --> 00:10:01,333
while we make the idea of
chasing you akin to suicide.

136
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:03,000
A losing battle.

137
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:04,250
Huh.

138
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:05,625
That's easy.

139
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:07,791
We just keep fighting
until we're all in the dirt.

140
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:11,083
There are plenty of
foolhardy Denizens

141
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:12,916
to create a
mountain of corpses.

142
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,750
We mustn't let
them go to waste.

143
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:20,166
In order for this
operation to be successful,

144
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:23,500
it must be executed
swiftly and precisely.

145
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:26,583
Once we're outside the
castle, Khamsin, Rebecca,

146
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:28,333
you will act as
the rear guard.

147
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:31,875
And as for you two...

148
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:33,833
Our purpose is quite clear.

149
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:36,916
We'll go and provide backup for
the Guardian of Steady Passage,

150
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,625
and cover any stragglers.

151
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:43,166
Very well, as of this moment,

152
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:45,250
Operation Ebb is
officially underway.

153
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:48,875
Wilhelmina, Shana,
a moment, please.

154
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:50,791
Do you have additional
orders for us?

155
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:52,375
Not at all.

156
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:55,208
I just wanted to address a more
personal matter with Shana.

157
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:57,708
Unless you're comfortable
going into battle as you are,

158
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,625
you might want to
change your clothes.

159
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:07,541
I think it would adversely
affect our troop's morale

160
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:10,500
if their reinforcements showed
up looking shabby and beaten.

161
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:12,458
Please, forgive
the oversight.

162
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:17,625
There is no hope for you!

163
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:19,916
We will ensure our
master's triumph!

164
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,208
Destroy all who would
oppose his Grand Order!

165
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:23,625
For Xanadu!

166
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:37,000
Die!

167
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:38,416
You first!

168
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,416
I feel bad jumpin'
into my buddies fights

169
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,375
and stealin' their
thunder, ya know?

170
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:49,916
Well I wouldn't
feel too bad

171
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,666
because it looks like they
still got the finishing blow!

172
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:53,791
Good to hear!

173
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,416
I don't think our timing
could be any better;

174
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,291
their reinforcements
ain't here yet.

175
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:03,875
You're good to go;
we've got this in the bag!

176
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:05,541
Understood.

177
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:08,000
All troops, it's time
to start the withdrawal.

178
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:09,208
Now, head to the east!

179
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:22,625
My body.

180
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:23,833
It has yet to recover

181
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:26,875
from the debilitating
effects of the rift.

182
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:29,541
How infuriating.

183
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:32,083
Only the long-departed
can recall

184
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:34,708
who first wished
for our god.

185
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:36,625
It has been
thousands of years

186
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:39,250
since he was drawn
to this place

187
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:42,208
by the prayers
of the Denizens.

188
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:43,500
Hey, Professor,

189
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:45,916
there's something that's
been bothering me lately.

190
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,791
Who exactly is that
Rofocale character?

191
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:51,208
He acts as though he's
the Trinity's equal!

192
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:55,458
I don't understand why he walked
the Path of Pilgrimage with us!

193
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:56,750
Jeez.

194
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:58,041
When will the data
I collected

195
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:01,250
with the Excellent 252546
Logical Pilgrim's box

196
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:03,000
finish its transfer?

197
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:06,750
The anticipation is
splitting my brain cells!

198
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:09,708
You weren't even
listening to me, were you?

199
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:12,208
You'll have to wait a
while longer, Professor.

200
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:15,125
We collected a ridiculous
amount of data from the rift!

201
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:18,208
Well, to answer
your question,

202
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:20,083
he is a disciple of
the God of Creation.

203
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:21,333
No way!

204
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:22,958
He's a disciple, too?

205
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:24,875
So, he really
is their equal?

206
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:27,708
I wouldn't say that;

207
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:29,541
the Trinity works
as a perfect system

208
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:32,666
that can strategize, defend,
and carry out the God's will.

209
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,250
It'd be pointless to
consider someone

210
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:36,833
who couldn't fulfill those
roles as their equal.

211
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,958
Then why did you go
with them to the Path...

212
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:40,791
Drop it, Domino!

213
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:46,333
He asked the Denizens
what they desired.

214
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:48,666
They said, "For our
bellies to be full".

215
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,833
Thus their wish
was decided

216
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:54,166
and the god's
ceremony began.

217
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,791
I must admit,

218
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:59,208
I'm impressed by the amount
of damage the enemy dealt us.

219
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:00,583
But, our losses
are nothing

220
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:02,500
compared to what
we've gained.

221
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:04,791
Then again, Bal Masque
was founded

222
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:06,416
to achieve this very goal.

223
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,000
So, they can't be
thought of as 'losses'.

224
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:11,041
The greatest of
hunters gathered

225
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:13,666
in the hopes of
stopping the god.

226
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,250
They bravely
sacrificed themselves

227
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:19,625
to forever seal
him in the Abyss.

228
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:22,541
We lost our god and
our hopes in that war.

229
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:23,666
But, from that defeat,

230
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:27,416
we learned how we
would rise again.

231
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,458
Strength in numbers.

232
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:30,791
A consortium of Denizens,

233
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:33,250
driven as one toward
a single goal.

234
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,875
Time passed,
flowed onward.

235
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:40,500
And now, three
thousand years later.

236
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:42,500
He has returned
once again

237
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:46,083
to grant the wish
of the masses.

238
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:47,666
Our god.

239
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,375
The Snake of the Festival.

240
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:57,666
The legendary
God of Creation.

241
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:07,916
There's another wave
comin' in fast, sir!

242
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,541
Our retreating forces
are depending on us

243
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:10,833
to hold the line!

244
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:12,958
Do not let a single
Denizen make it through!

245
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:31,250
Emblaze!

246
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:41,041
I'm the contractor of the
Flame of Heaven, Alastor,

247
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:42,750
the God of Atonement!

248
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:44,833
The Flaming-Haired
Blazing-Eyed Hunter.

249
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:46,958
Shana!

250
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,458
And I'm the contractor
of Tiamat,

251
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:57,875
the Tiara of Dreams
and Illusions.

252
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,416
Wilhelmina Carmel.

253
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:03,250
The Specialist
of Everything!

254
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:07,958
Thank you both.

255
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:09,875
You are just in time!

256
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:12,708
This fortress is vital to
our operation's success.

257
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:13,958
There's no need
for thanks.

258
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:15,916
Your troops can't
do this alone.

259
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,083
So we'll help
lighten the load!

260
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:19,791
We've caught two more
birds in our trap

261
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:21,000
without even trying.

262
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:24,791
Attack squads,
fall back at once!

263
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:26,250
We're moving forward
with our plan.

264
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:32,291
They're withdrawing!

265
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:34,791
But why?
They had us cornered!

266
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:36,666
All forces, be on guard!

267
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Rinne artillery spotted
to the west of us,

268
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,458
in the center of the plains!

269
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,458
We fell right
into their trap!

270
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,666
If all of those were to
hit at the same time...

271
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,750
We won't let them
get the best of us.

272
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:57,166
Concentrate your power!

273
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,166
Get ready!

274
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:17,750
Barricade.

275
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:19,250
Prevent passage.

276
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:20,375
And terminate.

277
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:22,125
Thy name is disgrace.

278
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,625
Zikmund's Gate!

279
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:28,125
This is the Unrestricted
Spell of the Guardian

280
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:31,000
of Steady Passage,
Samuel Demantius.

281
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:32,708
Stay on your guard!

282
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:35,291
He collects Power of
Existence from his comrades

283
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:38,250
to reinforce the
structures he creates.

284
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:40,958
A powerful Unrestricted
Spell, indeed.

285
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:42,541
An impressive talent.

286
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,833
Awesome, we've put some
distance between them!

287
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:57,958
Ah. It seems they
have no intention

288
00:17:58,041 --> 00:18:00,500
of making things
easy for us.

289
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:02,666
Especially since the
forces responsible

290
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:05,541
for that surprise attack are
finally entering the fray.

291
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,125
More bodies means we've
got more to explode!

292
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:12,416
Let's go!

293
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:18,083
Supreme Commander, the enemy's
launched a full-scale attack!

294
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:23,791
Godspeed, comrades.

295
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:29,333
I've never seen
anything like it.

296
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:32,708
The flames of battle burn
bodies and souls alike.

297
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:35,208
There is not a
remnant left behind.

298
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:37,083
It's ironic.

299
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:39,083
In order to prevent
future carnage,

300
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:41,083
I must instigate it now.

301
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:43,208
To protect them.

302
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:45,375
To protect her.

303
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,750
At this very moment,
an innocent human's soul

304
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:49,666
is being devoured.

305
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:52,583
Nobody will even
realize they're gone.

306
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:54,291
There will be no
one to mourn them,

307
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:56,125
no memories to cherish.

308
00:18:57,833 --> 00:19:01,166
Why would anyone want to
protect such a horrible world?

309
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:04,250
If I truly have the power
to change it, then I will!

310
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:06,125
No, I must!

311
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:07,666
If I don't, the Flame Haze

312
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:11,375
will be forced to
keep fighting forever.

313
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:13,458
Please! Do not
stand in my way.

314
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:14,958
I beg of you!

315
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:20,083
Hear me, Flame Haze!

316
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:22,000
The Lords who would
slay their brethren

317
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:25,500
and the humans they
use as weapons!

318
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:27,750
You have no cause
to resist me!

319
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,083
It was never my intention
to fill your hearts

320
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:32,041
with unbridled terror.

321
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:35,333
You have allowed your ancestors'
admonitions of disaster

322
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:38,541
to weigh upon you
for far too long.

323
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:40,083
I assure you,

324
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:42,083
the execution of
the Grand Order

325
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:45,458
will bring everlasting
peace to all of creation!

326
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:48,500
I realize that you have
concerns about our paradise,

327
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:51,958
Xanadu, being shaped within
the rift between worlds.

328
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:54,750
Perhaps I will set
your minds at ease

329
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:56,916
when I tell you with
absolute certainty,

330
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,958
despite what you have
been told for millennia,

331
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:00,625
No, he's lying.

332
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:02,750
You mustn't listen
to what he says!

333
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:07,750
I have spent thousands
of years in the rift

334
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:09,500
perfecting the
process of creation,

335
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:13,708
thereby eliminating any
chance of such a catastrophe.

336
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:14,875
In other words,

337
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:16,708
the disaster that
frightened your ancestors

338
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:20,583
enough to trap me in the
Abyss is now an impossibility!

339
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:23,416
Furthermore, I plan to gather
all of the Crimson Denizens

340
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,458
in this world

341
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:26,208
and take them to
Xanadu with me!

342
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:27,833
You have my word,

343
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:31,000
once Xanadu is complete we
will leave and never return.

344
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:34,333
We will leave a world in which
humans no longer disappear

345
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:37,125
and their souls
are not devoured.

346
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:39,125
Lay down your arms
and let us leave.

347
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:40,500
In doing so,

348
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:42,791
you will bring peace to the
humans once and for all.

349
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:46,500
Yuji!

350
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:48,833
You needn't
fight any more.

351
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:50,208
If you'll allow it,

352
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:53,708
we will free you from your
struggle, Flame Haze.

353
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:57,250
The battle you have fought for
millennia has now concluded.

354
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:58,375
It is over.

355
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:13,125
You must try to
calm down, Francois!

356
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:14,750
But I can't!

357
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:17,125
Because if his plan
is successful,

358
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:18,750
if that happens,

359
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:22,500
then there'll be no reason for
us to exist in this world.

360
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:23,833
We've lost,
Supreme Commander,

361
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:25,166
so what's the point
of trying to...

362
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,666
How can you say that?

363
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:31,083
We're still in the
midst of battle!

364
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:33,041
Sorry Grogach,
I won't give up.

365
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:41,500
It's pointless.

366
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:44,750
I mean, why
should we fight?

367
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:47,333
I guess, we're
no longer needed.

368
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:48,750
Do not give up!

369
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,875
Please everyone,
just calm down!

370
00:21:57,541 --> 00:21:59,583
This is exactly what
the enemy wants!

371
00:21:59,666 --> 00:22:02,500
We mustn't allow ourselves
to succumb to panic and chaos!

372
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:03,791
Please!

373
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:05,958
What a display of power.

374
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:09,208
All the God of Creation had to
do was utter a few words,

375
00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:10,750
suddenly he's
won the battle

376
00:22:10,833 --> 00:22:13,208
and the Flame Haze have lost
their sense of purpose.

377
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:19,000
Ah, it's done.

378
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:24,000
Dammit, this
ain't happening!

379
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:35,583
There's no way we can
regroup our forces now!

380
00:22:35,666 --> 00:22:37,250
This is pure chaos.

381
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:40,541
I cannot believe our army
has fallen into disarray.

382
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:43,583
Our very existence as
Flame Haze is meaningless, now.

383
00:22:43,666 --> 00:22:44,958
It's understandable.

384
00:22:45,041 --> 00:22:47,333
Regardless, we
cannot sit idly by

385
00:22:47,416 --> 00:22:49,333
and wait for annihilation!

386
00:22:49,416 --> 00:22:50,875
I agree with you!

387
00:22:50,958 --> 00:22:53,333
We mustn't waste our energy
worrying about our purpose

388
00:22:53,416 --> 00:22:55,666
or whether we'll
win this battle!

389
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,541
Instead, we'll take
what we've learned

390
00:22:57,625 --> 00:22:59,666
and use it to our
advantage in the next one.

391
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:01,666
But first...

392
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:03,666
We save as many
Flame Haze as possible,

393
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:06,125
and find the Supreme Commander!

394
00:23:06,208 --> 00:23:09,000
I never imagined I would
secure a flawless victory

395
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:12,125
for Bal Masque
against you, Sirotci.

396
00:23:12,208 --> 00:23:13,791
But now that I have,

397
00:23:13,875 --> 00:23:17,416
doubtful our paths
will ever cross again.

398
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,625
Therefore, in tribute,

399
00:23:18,708 --> 00:23:21,041
I shall leave you with
this cannon salute.

400
00:23:21,125 --> 00:23:23,750
May you rest in peace.

401
00:23:23,833 --> 00:23:24,666
Fire.

402
00:23:39,958 --> 00:23:42,250
All forces are now
ordered to withdraw!

403
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:43,458
Just keep running!

404
00:23:43,541 --> 00:23:46,125
Go east as fast
as you can!

405
00:23:46,208 --> 00:23:47,833
We'll cover you, just run!

406
00:23:49,125 --> 00:23:51,125
I couldn't do anything.

407
00:23:51,208 --> 00:23:52,166
Not at all.

408
00:23:53,166 --> 00:23:54,833
I've failed in every way.

409
00:23:55,791 --> 00:23:58,416
Because I haven't
faced Yuji.

410
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,791
I still feel something.

411
00:24:00,875 --> 00:24:03,333
Burning within me.

412
00:24:03,416 --> 00:24:05,375
I may not understand it.

413
00:24:05,458 --> 00:24:07,458
But my purpose is clear.

414
00:24:14,916 --> 00:24:16,625
After their morale
is destroyed,

415
00:24:16,708 --> 00:24:18,958
the Flame Haze Army falls
into utter disarray.

416
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:20,583
The rain begins to fall

417
00:24:20,666 --> 00:24:22,375
and with it comes
a glimmer of hope.

418
00:24:22,458 --> 00:24:24,583
Have their prayers
finally been answered?

419
00:24:24,666 --> 00:24:27,083
Next time, on
Shakugan no Shana Final:

420
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:28,333
"Rout in the Rain."
