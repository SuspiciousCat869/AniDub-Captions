00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,708
Yo.

00:01:02,791 --> 00:01:04,250
Jerk. You're late.

3
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:05,875
Yeah.

4
00:01:05,958 --> 00:01:09,208
I hope you have a better
apology than that for her...

5
00:01:09,291 --> 00:01:11,041
Let's go.

6
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:12,375
Okay.

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,833
The black mirror in the
sky is called the Divine Gate!

9
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:05,333
Beyond it...

10
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:06,541
there lies a path...

11
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:07,958
that will pave the way...

12
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:10,291
for the Snake of the
Festival's return!

13
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:13,833
The body he's
currently using

14
00:02:13,916 --> 00:02:16,291
and the Trinity are inside!

15
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:18,375
I, the Flaming-Haired
Blazing-Eyed Hunter,

16
00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:19,833
along with my comrades,...

17
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:22,583
will now venture
in to stop him!

18
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:40,416
To battle!

21
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:28,166
Hi, Sato... Welcome back.

22
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,333
Yoshida?

23
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:32,833
You coulda waited inside.

24
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:35,000
Oh, that was my fault...

25
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:37,208
I knew you'd be running
all the way to your house,

26
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:38,708
so I told her to
stand out here

27
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:41,083
and see which one of
us made it first.

28
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:42,458
And I won, right?

29
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:43,916
Just like I said I would.

30
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,041
Jeez... Weirdos.

31
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,041
You're not comin' in?

32
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:54,166
No thanks...

33
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,750
I'm just happy to
know you're home safe.

34
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:57,916
And safe you are...

35
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,833
I saw to it myself so...

36
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:01,541
My job's done.

37
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:03,250
Wha-... Dude...

38
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:05,875
Are we the people you came
back here to see...?

39
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:07,375
No, sir.

40
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:08,916
Uh, no...

41
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,583
You do know, uh...

42
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:14,083
how to wake a sleepin'
princess, don't ya?

43
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:15,541
Later.

44
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:17,625
Make sure to give us a
call when she wakes up.

45
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:20,541
Uh... sure.

46
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:51,375
You just gonna
sit there? !

47
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:53,958
Marcosias...

48
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:55,958
What are you doing here?

49
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:58,250
Whadaya think...? I heard
you were coming back,

50
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:00,833
an' I missed your stupid face.

51
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:02,333
That's all?

52
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:03,333
Ah, don't worry...

53
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:04,666
I'm not a Peeping Tom.

54
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:09,791
Wait a second,
you think that-?

55
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:12,041
That is why you
came back, isn't it?

56
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:13,875
Well...

57
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:15,291
yeah.

58
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,625
I take it Eita and the girl
told you what happened.

59
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,375
Yeah, some... I guess.

60
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:22,375
Well go on then, kid...

61
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:25,916
I gotta shut up now, 'fore
I say somethin' I regret.

62
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,500
Wha-... I, um...

63
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,791
Go.

64
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:31,333
Right.

65
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:35,625
An' remember,... when
it's time to act cool,...

66
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:39,125
there's no such
thing as too cool.

67
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:40,500
Best o' luck.

68
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:44,708
Marcosias... Thanks, man.

69
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:50,916
You can thank me
when she's okay.

70
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:00,500
Hey, Margery...

71
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:02,333
I'm back.

72
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:14,291
Yeah, so uh...

73
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:17,041
I heard about everything
that happened...

74
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:18,666
It must've been hard for
you to find out the truth

75
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,916
about the Silver.

76
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,541
I know you feel
like the centuries

77
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:25,625
you spent hunting him
are now meaningless.

78
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:28,291
It's rough...

79
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:31,708
but you can't give up
'cause we're counting on you...

80
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:33,250
Shana, Tanaka,...

81
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:35,375
Yoshida, Ogata...

82
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:38,208
Hell, even Sakai...

83
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,875
and me...

84
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:41,583
You've gotta keep
goin' for me.

85
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:46,958
No matter what anyone
thinks about you...

86
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:50,000
No matter what you
think about yourself...

87
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:52,375
The fact that you're even
here means more to me

88
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:56,041
than you could ever
possibly imagine.

89
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:59,208
My entire existence
has only one purpose...

90
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:01,750
I am devoted to
keeping you alive.

91
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:08,500
This is gonna
sound weird...

92
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:11,333
but when I heard
you needed me...

93
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:14,208
I couldn't help
feeling happy...

94
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:16,791
Because that
happiness told me...

95
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:18,250
That...

96
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:20,208
I really do
live for you...

97
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,333
and only for your sake.

98
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,250
And that's what I
want to tell you...

99
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:28,458
First thing...

100
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:30,375
As soon as you wake up.

101
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:43,541
Margery...

102
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,083
I heard...

103
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:51,791
I heard your voice.

104
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:57,791
But also...

105
00:08:57,875 --> 00:09:00,500
I heard Eita's and
Kazumi's voices...

106
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:03,458
as my world was
falling apart.

107
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:06,208
You can't leave him
without even sayin' goodbye!

108
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:07,708
Tanaka's right...!

109
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:09,708
Think about Sato, and
how you feel for him!

110
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:12,833
And I did...

111
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:15,833
At that moment I did
think about you...

112
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:18,041
I thought about my
feelings toward you.

113
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:22,625
I was surprised to
know they were there...

114
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:24,291
I doubted them...

115
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:25,708
I denied them...

116
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:30,083
I shut everything out.

117
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:31,583
Why?

118
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:35,791
If my feelings for
you were real,...

119
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,083
then I'd be able
to postpone

120
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:38,875
my obliteration...

121
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:41,625
even if it was only
for a little while...

122
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:44,750
Until I could be sure.

123
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:48,125
But they were
real, weren't they?

124
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:51,583
Real enough to keep
me from slipping away.

125
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:54,000
Then it was more
than enough...

126
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:56,750
and to me... that's
all that matters.

127
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:00,541
Thank you, Keisaku...

128
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:02,833
Or is that a bit trite?

129
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:04,791
I don't care...

130
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:07,833
just... Having you
here, alive...

131
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:10,208
It's not enough...

132
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:12,166
So as a woman,...

133
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:15,166
I ask you, as a man...

134
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,250
Tell me...

135
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:21,666
and I'm not questioning
your devotion...

136
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,041
Do you love me?

137
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:24,583
I do! Yes!

138
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:33,750
Do you remember...?

139
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:36,250
What I told you
about Flame Haze...?

140
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:38,791
That we're too strong to
hold anyone too close?

141
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:42,416
Yeah...

142
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:46,875
For a short time...

143
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:49,833
I can make you as
strong as I am...

144
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:51,041
But then...

145
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:52,708
if I don't create
some distance...

146
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:55,708
I'll draw even closer...

147
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:57,583
Right?

148
00:10:57,666 --> 00:11:00,208
That's how it's
been between us...

149
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:02,791
'til this point.

150
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:06,125
And now?

151
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:07,583
Why don't you find out?

152
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,958
What's that?

153
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:49,083
A bird... that's
not truly a bird.

154
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,750
It appears to be one of
the Ancient Flame Haze...

155
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:53,875
who helped to banish
the God of Creation

156
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:55,666
so many centuries ago.

157
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:00,416
I guess it wants
us to follow, huh?

158
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,000
Seems to be the case.

159
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:23,666
The enemy's lack of
organization had begun

160
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,541
to turn the tide of
battle in our favor,

161
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:27,583
Supreme Commander...

162
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:29,791
But the latest reports from
troops on the front lines

163
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:33,041
say the fortress guards
have now emerged.

164
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:36,041
They were not expecting an
attack on their main stronghold,

165
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:39,500
and left it ill-defended.

166
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:42,666
François, show us the
current situation please.

167
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,458
Right... Well,
let's take a look.

168
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:04,875
Within my
detection radius...

169
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:07,166
I see a force approaching
from the north...

170
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:10,083
Most likely, the Bal
Masqué defensive forces...

171
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:11,791
turning their
attentions inward.

172
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,791
Closer to us,
from the south,...

173
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:18,291
there's another
force approaching.

174
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:20,625
Neither group is very
great in number...

175
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:23,000
We'll have no trouble
defeating them...

176
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:25,458
The problem is the
two larger forces,...

177
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:27,541
which have withdrawn,
to the east and west...

178
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:29,708
Even marching at
top speed though,

179
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:32,000
I don't think they'd make
it here before morning.

180
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:34,333
Our own forces
continue to harass

181
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:36,500
and pursue the
retreating troops.

182
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,000
however...

183
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:39,333
For now,...

184
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:41,500
the advantage we
enjoy is temporary...

185
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:43,708
It will last only until
one of their large

186
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:45,166
armies arrives,...

187
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,333
from either the
east or the west.

188
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,416
How much can we
still accomplish...

189
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,541
before time runs out?

190
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,750
Firstly... Send about half of
our available reserve units

191
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:04,125
as reinforcements to aid
those who are bravely

192
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:06,291
fighting near the
Divine Gate...

193
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:09,083
It need merely be enough of
our troops to occupy them...

194
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:12,333
Our goal is to split
the enemy forces in two.

195
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:13,458
Secondly...

196
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:15,375
Samuel, you'll lead
the remaining part

197
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:16,541
of our reserves,...

198
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:18,791
in an assault on the
Palace of the Stars.

199
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:20,708
Ma'am.

200
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:22,000
Thirdly...

201
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:23,916
Neither the God
of Creation,...

202
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
nor any of the Trinity are
present in this battle...

203
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:29,833
Let's use that to our
destructive advantage.

204
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:49,250
We lack the
necessary troops...

205
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:53,125
But the Palace of the Stars
guards our greatest secrets...

206
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:57,500
It must not fall into Outlaw's
hands even for an instant...

207
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:59,500
Therefore,...

208
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:03,125
I must buy time at least until
our nearest forces arrive...

209
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,083
The western forces,
and their commander,...

210
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:10,833
Burning Agitation Haborym,
are on their way...

211
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:15,083
Had they arrived, this
would not be a problem.

212
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:17,291
While they should
be here soon,...

213
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:19,291
we simply do not have
enough troops

214
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:21,875
to last until that time.

215
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:23,458
It seems, then...

216
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:24,833
I have no choice.

217
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:30,750
What the-?

218
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:37,791
This is...

219
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:39,375
Whatever's causing
it is moving!

220
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:43,000
Impossible!

221
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,875
Decarabia? !

222
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:09,458
Standing on the front
lines like this,

223
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:10,708
leading his troops...

224
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:12,666
It is so
uncharacteristic...

225
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,750
It seems that attacking
Decarabia directly

226
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:39,833
is not doing any damage!

227
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,875
And attacks that have so
far been effective

228
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:44,541
against the Denizens...
are no longer working!

229
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:47,750
Yes... There's an Unrestricted
Spell of teleportation

230
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:50,333
around his body, to
deflect attacks...

231
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:52,750
And he's using defensive
spells to bolster

232
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:55,208
the Denizens on
the battlefield.

233
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:57,000
But such simple spells
wouldn't blanket

234
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:58,416
the entire army.

235
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,333
He must have cast them
on each individual...

236
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:04,583
His madness
knows no bounds.

237
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:07,083
He must have appeared
personally...

238
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:09,291
In order to cast so many
Unrestricted Spells

239
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,916
on the battlefield...

240
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:11,958
But this...

241
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,166
Any intent he had of
dragging out the battle

242
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,375
has been abandoned.

243
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:18,958
It's not desperation...

244
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:21,583
He's taking a
calculated risk.

245
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:26,333
Are his forces so depleted
that he's willing

246
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:28,500
to sacrifice his
own life...?

247
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:32,000
Or perhaps... Reinforcements are
close enough at hand...

248
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:35,416
that he need hold the line
only for a short time?

249
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:41,250
Whatever his intent,

250
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:43,875
it seems that I must not hold
my power in reserve, either!

251
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:48,916
Focus our attacks
on a single point...

252
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,458
We build a bridge,...

253
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:52,416
a single road above...

254
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,916
Understood, Zirnitra?

255
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,333
We build a bridge,...

256
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:56,958
a single road above...

257
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:58,291
Establishing...

258
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:00,375
Begin the operation,...

259
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:01,791
Demantius.

260
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:07,291
Disrupt...! Then
strike down...

261
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:08,833
And build anew...

262
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:10,208
Thy name is honor...

263
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:12,125
O, Hill of Zizka!

264
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:41,625
All forces...! Form
your ranks on me!

265
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:45,750
And ... Ready...!

266
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,500
Unto the breach!

267
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:00,125
The blizzard...

268
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:01,458
It has stopped!

269
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:10,541
With my sight restored,

270
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:12,833
targeting them
will be simple.

271
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:18,958
I will only have time
for a single strike...

272
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:20,416
Therefore,...

273
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,500
That strike will
contain my power...

274
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:23,916
at its fullest.

275
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:31,083
Found you!

276
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,416
Yeeeaaaahhh!!!

277
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:20,125
Nicely done...

278
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:22,291
But don't you think you
used too much of your power?

279
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:24,916
Perhaps so, but it
was well worth it...

280
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,375
I'm sure Samuel can handle
things from here on...

281
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:29,958
Su-Supreme Commander!

282
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:32,708
Massive incoming...!
From outta nowhere!

283
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:33,666
On our Western flank!

284
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:37,125
How? ! We were
watching everything!

285
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:50,958
That flame...

286
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:57,291
Haborym, the Burning
Agitation...!

287
00:20:57,375 --> 00:20:58,666
That means...

288
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,250
their western forces
have returned...

289
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:02,333
But how did they
arrive so quickly?

290
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:03,875
What we dismissed as
a flock of birds

291
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:06,541
was an Unrestricted Spell
of concealment...?!

292
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:08,416
We've been fooled.

293
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,541
Enemy reinforcements!

294
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:12,291
What the hell...?! They're
right on our flank!

295
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,791
The time has come,...

296
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,458
but sooner than
we expected.

297
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,500
Margery? !

298
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:25,750
What?

299
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:29,500
What are you gawkin' at?

300
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:31,666
Um. Sorry.

301
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:34,208
So anyway, this file
you brought me...?

302
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:35,333
I'm all caught up...

303
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:37,583
Y'know, on Sophie's
plans here...

304
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:40,791
Operations: Calm...
Crossing...s and Ebb.

305
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:42,458
So...?

306
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:43,750
So, get up...

307
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:45,166
and put on some clothes...

308
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,125
We're leaving.

309
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:49,000
You are with me,...

310
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:50,416
aren't you?

311
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:53,041
Up ahead...

312
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:56,000
I see Unrestricted Spells
placed on the fortress...

313
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:58,208
They're centered on
the hidden Rinne.

314
00:21:58,291 --> 00:21:59,458
Three layers...

315
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:01,666
cloaking and
intercommunication...

316
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:04,125
but the last one
I don't recognize.

317
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:06,416
That would indeed bring
it to a total of twelve

318
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,666
defenses which
lie in our path...

319
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,708
Their goal is the
same as always...

320
00:22:10,791 --> 00:22:11,958
Delay progress.

321
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:14,750
Ah... But what worries
me is your inability

322
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,750
to recognize that
third spell.

323
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:20,333
We should proceed
with all due caution.

324
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:23,208
Man, that Judgment spell
of yours sure comes in handy...

325
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:24,875
If you want, I'll trade
ya for Landmine-

326
00:22:24,958 --> 00:22:26,625
but all it does
is break stuff.

327
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:29,708
Knowledge over
violence, huh...?

328
00:22:29,791 --> 00:22:31,375
Look who's all grown up!

329
00:22:31,458 --> 00:22:33,000
Oh, shut up.

330
00:22:33,083 --> 00:22:43,041
[Music]

331
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:50,875
[Music]

332
00:24:14,416 --> 00:24:16,958
Sabrac attacks but Shana
leaves Wilhelmina

333
00:24:17,041 --> 00:24:19,500
and the others to fight,
so she can chase after me.

334
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:21,250
The question is,
can she make it before

335
00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:23,166
Hecate completes
the ritual to recover

336
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:24,791
the Snake of the
Festival's body?

337
00:24:24,875 --> 00:24:26,916
Next time, on Shakugan
no Shana Final...

338
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,333
"Words of a Vow."
