1
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:54,041
[Music]

2
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:22,125
You're not hurt, are you?

3
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:25,958
No.

4
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:39,916
Oh good, they're okay.

5
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:43,791
You've become
like a mother hen.

6
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:46,125
Um. How did we
survive the crash?

7
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:48,625
The boss's spell
Kuranominokasa.

8
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:54,041
It concealed the van

9
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:55,916
and created an optical
illusion behind us

10
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,500
that acted as a decoy.

11
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:03,291
Thankfully, the
enemy fell for it

12
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:05,708
and they fired
at the illusion.

13
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:08,375
Once we were in the clear,
the Mobilizer took over.

14
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:09,708
Tell her.

15
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:12,125
It was not an easy task,
to say the least.

16
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:15,625
Khamsin!

17
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:17,250
Ah.

18
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:20,166
We cast a spell on a
rock inside the van,

19
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,375
and another onto the
rubble from the tower,

20
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:24,125
then Khamsin
connected the two

21
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:26,125
in order to pull the
vehicle to safety.

22
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:28,166
It was a precarious
situation,

23
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,750
but he handled
it beautifully.

24
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:32,000
Once we'd landed safely,

25
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:34,500
he enveloped us with
Qadesh's Heart Chamber,

26
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:37,083
and took on the brunt of
the explosion himself.

27
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:41,875
Ah. I did what had to
be done to protect you.

28
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:44,875
That is my responsibility,
after all.

29
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:47,291
And I'm only
getting started.

30
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:49,916
According to the Puppeteer
of Devilish Skills,

31
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,041
each of these robots is
carrying a powerful bomb.

32
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:55,458
What?

33
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:57,791
If detonated, they will
disintegrate everything

34
00:03:57,875 --> 00:03:59,125
within a hundred
foot radius.

35
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:03,541
So they're a lot more
dangerous than they look.

36
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:08,416
Ah.

37
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,083
The Crimson Denizens have
completely lost control.

38
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,458
Hyakki Yakou,

39
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:16,083
can we trust you to take
care of them for us?

40
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:17,416
You know it!

41
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,875
Promise to hang on tight
to those two, little lady?

42
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:24,333
I will!

43
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:28,375
Activate!

44
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:30,583
Activating
Qadesh's Blood Seal.

45
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:42,458
You will overcome the pain,

46
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:45,375
and, in the end,
it will make you stronger.

47
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:47,875
I have faith in
you, my friend.

48
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:49,541
Take care of yourself

49
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:52,625
and remember to always follow
the path you think is best,

50
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:55,833
Kazumi Yoshida.

51
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:58,541
Constructing
Qadesh's Blood Pulse.

52
00:04:58,625 --> 00:04:59,625
Deploying!

53
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:02,166
Behemoth!

54
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,500
Khamsin!

55
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:09,166
We've gotta
get outta here.

56
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:25,500
How could I be such a fool?

57
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:26,875
I allowed Yoshida to escape

58
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:28,791
because I thought they
would keep her safe.

59
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,291
There's no way I can
convince the Engaged Link

60
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:36,791
to do what I
want them to do.

61
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,166
Khamsin seems to be holding up,
but for how long?

62
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:49,583
It looks like the
geezers and Hyakki Yakou

63
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:51,000
are completely surrounded.

64
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,958
Why isn't the Engaged Link
helping them fight?

65
00:05:57,916 --> 00:05:59,000
Something's not right.

66
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:05,000
Enemy advancing.

67
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:07,041
Indeed, but what
should we do?

68
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:08,833
We cannot leave this
fight right now.

69
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,375
Wilhelmina, will you go?

70
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:23,416
I don't understand,
don't you need my help?

71
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,125
Please, old friend.

72
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:28,708
Specialist of Everything,
Wilhelmina Carmel,

73
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:32,000
do it for the sake of
the child you raised.

74
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:33,541
If I were you
I'd get going.

75
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:35,458
Now that we've
finished the prep work.

76
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:37,666
All we're really doing here

77
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:40,416
is wasting time until it's
the right moment to strike.

78
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,250
Besides, if you refuse
the God of Atonement,

79
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:46,333
I'd hate to see what your
punishment would be!

80
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:47,666
What about you?

81
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:48,708
I'll be okay.

82
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:50,375
Don't worry about me.

83
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:52,958
You have my permission to
fight however you see fit!

84
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:56,958
Protect Kazumi,
and your friends,

85
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,458
the Engaged Link, too!

86
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,958
I shall do my best.

87
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:09,041
I can't help but feel
like I'm abandoning her

88
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:11,375
at a time when she
needs me the most.

89
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:15,166
And yet, I know she
can handle it alone.

90
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,916
She's become a
powerful warrior,

91
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,500
and it's time
that I let her go.

92
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:22,208
Indeed.

93
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:24,041
That is what's best
for both of us.

94
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:26,833
I wholeheartedly agree.

95
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:28,666
You were so
consumed with caring

96
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,750
for the Flaming-Haired
Blazing- Eyed Hunter,

97
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:32,666
that you lost touch
with yourself.

98
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:36,291
You were once a force
to be reckoned with

99
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:38,375
but you chose to
put everything aside

100
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,583
to allow her flame
to grow stronger.

101
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:44,166
As your Crimson Lord,

102
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,125
I have watched you struggle
with this decision

103
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:48,208
for so very long.

104
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:51,416
However, anytime I attempted
to discuss it with you,

105
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,083
I felt as though I was
merely tossing pebbles

106
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:56,375
into your sea of suffering.

107
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:58,541
I was so worried
about you.

108
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:01,583
Well, you needn't
worry any longer.

109
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:03,000
I'm proud of you.

110
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:04,208
Really?

111
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:06,333
Thanks, Tiamat.

112
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:09,000
I would be lost without you.

113
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:38,375
Are you prepared to
move forward, Shana?

114
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:39,875
Yeah.

115
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:42,250
So it's the two of us
against the two of them, huh?

116
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:44,041
I gotta feelin' this
ain't gonna be easy.

117
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:45,375
It shouldn't be too bad,

118
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,291
as long as the lil'
miss has our back!

119
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:49,500
We just gotta be sure to
look out for each other.

120
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:50,750
He's right.

121
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:52,208
I know you're not
too fond of me

122
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:54,125
but we're gonna have
to work together.

123
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:56,125
Where'd you get the idea
that I don't like you?

124
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:00,375
I like you a lot!

125
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:01,458
You do?

126
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,208
Thanks, kid.

127
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:06,666
I'm assuming she means
just as a friend,

128
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:09,666
'cause you've already got a
significant other, dontcha?

129
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:45,500
Ah, this is more like it.

130
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:48,916
They are fighting
as hard as they can.

131
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,833
It's unfortunate so
many must die simply

132
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:53,958
because they're unable
to see the truth.

133
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:15,875
Protecting something
is difficult.

134
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:18,333
Indeed but it is
a job worth doing.

135
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:19,625
Fire!

136
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:29,333
Gyuuki, it's down already!

137
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:30,708
Can you cast another one?

138
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:32,250
Damn, that was fast.

139
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:35,208
We gotta hold out long enough
to justify using the spell.

140
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:36,916
Yeah, but with the number
of enemies out there,

141
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
we can't wait
too long, Boss.

142
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:41,041
We can't hide in
here forever,

143
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:42,250
eventually they're
gonna find us.

144
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:47,958
Here it goes.

145
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:12,250
We'll move once they pass.

146
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:16,291
Are you all right?

147
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:17,375
Yeah.

148
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:18,375
I'm okay.

149
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:20,000
Sorry, it just frightened me.

150
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:23,916
What'll we do?

151
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,625
We've run out of
places to hide, Gyuuki.

152
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:27,041
Ya better think fast!

153
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:34,666
Over there!

154
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,083
Inside the tower?

155
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:37,541
Para!

156
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:38,750
Roger!

157
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:57,708
I'm in! Releasing the lock now.

158
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,375
Doors are open, Boss.

159
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:03,541
Okay, we're comin'!

160
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:19,416
Aw, man!

161
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:04,500
Good job!
You got him!

162
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:05,625
It was just one!

163
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:07,291
You've gotta keep
your guard up, Chiara!

164
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:08,166
Right!

165
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:15,291
I smell a victory.

166
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:21,458
It shouldn't be long

167
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:25,000
until the Mobilizer of
Ceremonial Equipment falls.

168
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:26,458
I'm surprised
the Engaged Link

169
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:28,541
hasn't come to
their ally's rescue.

170
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:30,166
What cowards.

171
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,958
I have come to
help you escape.

172
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:52,666
Your rear guard.

173
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,333
Wilhelmina!

174
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,083
Are you all right?

175
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:57,208
What is that?

176
00:13:57,291 --> 00:14:01,291
Well, Pheles and Johann
gave this to me.

177
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:04,833
Is that the
Midnight Lost Child?

178
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:06,041
No, it's not.

179
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:07,208
Discuss it later.

180
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:14,291
We were gonna run
into the tower

181
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:16,291
but I don't know if
that's a good idea.

182
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:17,875
Where does this door lead?

183
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:19,666
To an interior hallway.

184
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,250
I haven't seen any
enemies so far.

185
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:26,083
I'll keep watch
once we get inside.

186
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:27,333
If it gets bad,
I'll let you know.

187
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:28,625
Roger.

188
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:31,083
I'll keep them from
chasing after you,

189
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:33,708
and I shall do what I can
to keep you safe, indeed.

190
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:35,166
Focus on defense.

191
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:43,333
That was a little too
close for comfort.

192
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:46,291
The Specialist of Everything's
gonna guard the doorway.

193
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:49,208
Meanwhile, what're
we gonna do here?

194
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:50,583
From what I can tell,

195
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:53,541
this is actually a chute
used to transport something.

196
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:55,166
What do you mean
by "something"?

197
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:58,166
I mean, I don't know
what it transports.

198
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,416
Luckily, I figured out
how to deactivate it,

199
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,916
so we should be
safe for now.

200
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,083
Then let's hang here
as long as we can

201
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:07,083
but remember to keep an
eye out for the enemy.

202
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:08,166
You got it.

203
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,583
Please be safe out
there, everyone.

204
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:29,000
Uh-oh.

205
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:30,708
Mammon's showed up!

206
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:35,041
I was tryin' to save this trick
until the very last second.

207
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:37,041
But we're gonna
have to use it

208
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:39,416
even though we haven't
perfected it yet.

209
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,250
Chiara, take the lead.

210
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:44,250
It's about time we show
Bal Masque what we can do!

211
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:45,916
Okay!

212
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,666
Well, here we go!

213
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:53,500
Launching in three, two...

214
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:55,000
Now!

215
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:12,166
Sale, no!

216
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,125
Havin' fun yet?

217
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:26,041
No!

218
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,125
Say bye bye!

219
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:37,041
'Cause I've got
you now, Sale!

220
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:40,750
Shut up!

221
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:52,250
Professor! All systems are go!

222
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:54,250
You can detonate
at any time!

223
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:56,916
Okay, then!

224
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,208
This is it!

225
00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:01,125
Here we go!

226
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:09,791
Sale!

227
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:14,375
Not so fast!

228
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:23,375
Uh-oh! Your luck's run out!

229
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:26,250
Ha! Goodbye,
Sale Habichtsburg!

230
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:27,416
Die!

231
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:44,791
Professor!

232
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:49,666
Oh, that's a nice trick!

233
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,416
I've got one, too!

234
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:56,041
Huh?

235
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:59,875
Now launching the
emergency escape system!

236
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:14,125
Oh no.

237
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:30,666
One more time!

238
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:38,750
What have they
done to you?

239
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:40,958
They have defeated me.

240
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:43,333
I'm sorry, Pirsoyn.

241
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:46,125
You've come to my rescue
but it is too late.

242
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,375
We've lost the
Seeking Researcher,

243
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:50,958
Dantalion.

244
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:52,750
The robots are going berserk

245
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:54,791
now that he's not
here to guide them

246
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:57,916
and the control
room's been destroyed.

247
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,875
You must hurry and get
far away from here.

248
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:03,041
But what about you?

249
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:08,333
What is he planning to do?

250
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:09,708
When the enemy's near death

251
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:11,083
they have nothing to lose.

252
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:13,125
Be careful, Chiara.

253
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:15,708
Satisfy my ravenous greed.

254
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:17,500
These robots.

255
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:19,750
Bring them to me, now!

256
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:35,041
Mammon sacrificed himself
to save the tower?

257
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:36,916
Man, that's some
loyalty, huh?

258
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,041
Well, it's good to know

259
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:40,000
he had one redeeming
quality at least,

260
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:42,000
but I still can't say
I'm sorry to see him go.

261
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:46,333
That ain't good!

262
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:47,875
The old man's caught
in the middle of 'em!

263
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:15,416
I've lost the Dragon's
Tail and the Silver.

264
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,083
Is this the end?

265
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:20,750
I must say, your
naivety surprises me.

266
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:22,250
Did you honestly believe

267
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:24,041
altering the Psalm
of the Grand Order

268
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:26,041
would somehow
foil my plans?

269
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,458
I am the God of Creation.

270
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:31,375
You have underestimated my power

271
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:33,708
and insulted the intelligence
of my loyal servants,

272
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:36,083
the Trinity.

273
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:37,750
The priestess who
sacrificed herself

274
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:40,750
to act as the Psalm of
the Grand Order's core.

275
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:42,333
The Supreme Throne, Hecate.

276
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:47,208
And he who sits at the
right hand of a god,

277
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:49,708
a man who would slay any
who dare to oppose me.

278
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:52,708
Thousand Changes, Sydonay.

279
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:54,333
Behold!

280
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:57,083
The stratagem of she who
determines divine will

281
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:59,458
and judges that
which is false.

282
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:02,958
The Judge of
Paradoxes, Bel-Peol!

283
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:27,833
Something has gone
terribly wrong.

284
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:30,583
The spell didn't change.

285
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:33,041
So, it doesn't work?

286
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,541
Well it certainly
looks that way.

287
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:37,875
We infiltrated the
True Ruler's Shrine

288
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:39,666
and located the Conloquiem

289
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:42,583
which acts as the Psalm of the
Grand Order's backup system.

290
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:46,583
While you guys were distracted
with all the fighting,

291
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:48,416
I hit it with the
same altered spell

292
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,916
the midget had attached to
the Chorde Treasure Tool.

293
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:54,583
Then all we had to do was
wait for 'ol three eyes

294
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:57,291
to pull the switch on the
Conloquiem and viola!

295
00:21:57,375 --> 00:21:59,000
Your plan was foiled.

296
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:07,583
[Music]

297
00:23:56,875 --> 00:23:58,958
The Snake of the Festival,
Yuji Sakai,

298
00:23:59,041 --> 00:24:01,625
awaits the summoning of divine
power with bated breath.

299
00:24:01,708 --> 00:24:03,125
When it seems things
can't get worse,

300
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:05,291
an unexpected
disaster strikes,

301
00:24:05,375 --> 00:24:07,083
and the shape of the
new world is decided.

302
00:24:07,166 --> 00:24:09,333
Next time, on Shakugan
no Shana Final:

303
00:24:09,416 --> 00:24:10,333
"Dream of the God."
