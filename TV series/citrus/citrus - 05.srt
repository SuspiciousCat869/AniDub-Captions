1
00:01:45,416 --> 00:01:46,500
[YUZU]
Uh.

2
00:01:48,458 --> 00:01:50,791
Ah, jeez, it's
stupid Momokino.

3
00:01:50,875 --> 00:01:52,583
[grunts]

4
00:01:52,666 --> 00:01:54,750
Great, it's Yuzu Aihara.

5
00:01:54,833 --> 00:01:57,416
Hello, slob. Exactly where
do you think you're going?

6
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,166
Mei forgot her lunch
box this morning

7
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:02,875
so I just wanna make sure
she gets to eat something.

8
00:02:02,958 --> 00:02:05,000
Why would you do that right
after I instructed you

9
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,708
to keep your distance from her?

10
00:02:06,791 --> 00:02:09,416
Sorry, but we live together,
what'd you honestly expect?

11
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,041
Right.

12
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:11,416
In that case,

13
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,625
why are you carrying around
two lunch boxes, then?

14
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:16,083
You don't need
yours to deliver hers.

15
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:17,666
[YUZU] If we're
playing 20 questions,

16
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:20,000
why do you eat in the
student council room?

17
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:23,083
You can't tear yourself
away from work, can ya?

18
00:02:25,416 --> 00:02:27,583
[HIMEKO] You're fighting
a war you can't win!

19
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:29,000
The president and I did things.

20
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:31,333
We've crossed lines that
you're never gonna cross.

21
00:02:31,416 --> 00:02:32,833
[YUZU gasps]

22
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:34,708
So? Big deal!

23
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:37,000
I'll so cross lines. Don't
tell me how to live my life!

24
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:38,083
[gasps]

25
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:40,333
[HIMEKO]
Uh!

26
00:02:40,416 --> 00:02:42,208
Don't you run from me!

27
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:46,416
--[YUZU] Mei!
--[HIMEKO] President!

28
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:51,208
[HIMEKO, YUZU chattering]

29
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:52,541
Oh, come on!

30
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:54,500
At least let her take a
break to have some lunch.

31
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:57,500
Whatever, it'll be more
efficient this way.

32
00:02:57,583 --> 00:02:58,750
We have a lot of work to do,

33
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:00,541
and we can't do that
with you around.

34
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:02,708
Listen, you.

35
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:05,333
[MEI]
Quiet.

36
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:08,083
You two go eat lunch together.

37
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:11,750
I have work to do.
I need peace and quiet.

38
00:03:20,916 --> 00:03:22,958
Way to go.

39
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:25,125
You just had to barge in
and start bothering her.

40
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:26,583
How can you accuse
me of something

41
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:28,458
that's so obviously your fault?

42
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:31,875
[YUZU] Wait. Why did she
get mad at both of us?

43
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:34,541
Momokino says they've crossed
some kind of line together,

44
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:37,333
but she doesn't seem to be
getting any special treatment.

45
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:39,333
[HARUMI]
Hey, Yuzucchi!

46
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:41,291
Whatcha doin' in the cafeteria?

47
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:43,666
Thank goodness
you're here, Harumin.

48
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,125
[HARUMI]
This is a weird combo.

49
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:47,083
Since when are you
friends with that?

50
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:50,125
How absurd. Do I look like
I'd be friends with a hoodlum?

51
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:51,583
[HARUMI]
Check it out, girl.

52
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:54,083
I got theme park tickets.
Wanna go with me?

53
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:55,500
[YUZU]
Sure, okay.

54
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:57,416
I'm thinking, like, next Sunday.

55
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,041
Our exams are coming up.

56
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:01,583
This is hardly the right
time for goofing off.

57
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:03,833
[HARUMI]
So you wanna come with?

58
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:05,500
Why would I do that, huh?

59
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:06,833
Oh, if you're on board,

60
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:08,500
we might as well invite
the president too.

61
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:09,875
[HIMEKO, YUZU]
Really?

62
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:14,958
Okay. What's up with
the weird double act?

63
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:22,458
[YUZU] It won't be a date
with all four of us,

64
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:25,625
but it would be nice
to go there with Mei.

65
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:28,666
[HIMEKO] I highly doubt
the president can make it.

66
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,208
Not only does she have her
normal student council duties,

67
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:32,708
but she's covering
the chairman's work

68
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:34,250
while he's in the hospital.

69
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:37,291
She works every
waking hour these days.

70
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:38,375
Uh!

71
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:42,500
You just--! That's basically
a kiss, you know!

72
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:43,291
[BOTH]
Huh?

73
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:45,208
It's indirect, but still--

74
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:47,541
I think those curls of
yours are too tight, girl.

75
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:49,916
Loosen up and try
something different.

76
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,916
[YUZU] I never thought of
kisses that way before,

77
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,333
but Mei and I could do it.

78
00:04:58,083 --> 00:05:00,208
[YUZU]
No, that's way too forward!

79
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:03,500
The next step is to spend a
little quality time with her.

80
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:08,833
[YUZU] I guess there's no
harm in asking her, right?

81
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,166
[HARUMI]
Hm?

82
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,875
[HIMEKO] Ugh. I'll make a
note of it in my calendar.

83
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,208
[YUZU]
Tomorrow's when I visit Papa.

84
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:28,500
I was planning to do it
by myself like usual,

85
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:30,166
but maybe it'll be
a perfect chance

86
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,458
to get a bit closer to Mei

87
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:34,000
before we all go
to the theme park.

88
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:40,041
[YUZU] Besides, I'd like
to introduce Mei to him.

89
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:42,416
I'm sure he's not
gonna mind that.

90
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:44,708
[YUZU]
Huh?

91
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:47,750
[YUZU]
I'm home!

92
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:49,125
[UME]
Hey, Yuzu!

93
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:51,166
Is Mei back home, yet?

94
00:05:57,875 --> 00:05:59,333
[YUZU]
Mei?

95
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:04,166
You got a letter in the mail.
Looks like it's from your dad.

96
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,041
I wonder where he sent it from.

97
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:08,583
Should I maybe open it?

98
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:10,000
Huh?

99
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:11,041
[MEI]
Stop!

100
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:12,375
Whoa, I'm sorry!

101
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:14,250
I wasn't actually gonna
open somebody else's mail.

102
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:17,708
Don't worry, I'll go put it on
your desk for you right away!

103
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:26,958
[YUZU] That scared me.
She was super mad!

104
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:31,125
[YUZU]
Uh, Mei?

105
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:33,250
[MEI]
What?

106
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:35,541
[YUZU] Aren't you gonna
read your letter?

107
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:37,916
[MEI]
It's none of your business.

108
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,333
[YUZU]
That's fair.

109
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:42,916
Anyway, do you think maybe
I can borrow you tomorrow?

110
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,166
I was hoping you'd come
with me to meet my dad.

111
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,166
[MEI]
And why is that?

112
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,666
Mom said she wanted
you to go, so...

113
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:54,125
[YUZU]
Great, now I'm liar.

114
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:56,500
[MEI]
All right then.

115
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:59,875
If it's important
to her, I'll go.

116
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:06,458
[YUZU]
Sorry, Momokino,

117
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:09,583
but I guess this puts
me in the lead.

118
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:11,166
[YUZU sighs]

119
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:14,833
If this keeps up, I'll literally
never get any sleep.

120
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:20,416
[HIMEKO] Why did I
volunteer to invite her

121
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,750
when I know she won't come?

122
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:24,875
Now I'll be the one who's
going to look flakey.

123
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:25,791
[UME]
Hello?

124
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:27,166
Yes. Good day.

125
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:30,416
This is Mei's most treasured
friend Momokino calling.

126
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,583
Is she the--?

127
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:33,083
[UME] Oh, I'm sorry,
you just missed her!

128
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:35,291
She's out with Yuzu right now.

129
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,625
What? Curse that Yuzu Aihara.

130
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:44,041
She's going to pay
dearly for this insult!

131
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:45,375
Something the matter?

132
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:47,583
I just got chills for
some weird reason.

133
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:50,500
[YUZU] Almost like
someone's watching me.

134
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:51,708
[gasp]

135
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:55,000
[YUZU gasps]

136
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:00,875
[YUZU]
It's all in my head.

137
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,458
[YUZU]
This is my first date with Mei.

138
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:07,666
No one can get in my way.

139
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,875
[YUZU]
Hey! Mei!

140
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,500
Where'd you go?

141
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:17,333
[YUZU]
Not a great way to start off.

142
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,333
[YUZU]
I have to look out for her!

143
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:23,541
[YUZU]
I've got you!

144
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:34,833
[MEI gasps]

145
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:39,000
Um, please, don't breathe, okay?

146
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,166
Don't breathe?

147
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,291
What, do you want me
to die or something?

148
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:43,875
[MEI gasps]

149
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:47,583
Whoops. Did I step
on your toe, or--?

150
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:49,333
[YUZU gasps]

151
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:52,708
[YUZU]
Wow. Her body's so warm.

152
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:54,291
Come on, tell me.

153
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:55,916
[MEI gasps]

154
00:08:57,083 --> 00:09:00,625
[YUZU] Maybe this is my moment
to cross a line with her.

155
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:11,125
[YUZU]
Uh, now what do I do?

156
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:13,416
[MEI]
Hey! Stop fooling around!

157
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:17,750
This is a public setting.
Control yourself.

158
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:19,083
I'm serious!

159
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:21,166
I really wanna
be with you, okay?

160
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,791
Um, what do you mean?

161
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:26,250
It's just... Momokino, she...

162
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:30,916
She said that you
guys, um, you know...

163
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:35,458
Look, Mei. I'm sorry!

164
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,833
But I can make it up
to you with crepes.

165
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:41,041
[MEI]
It's not that I'm angry.

166
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:42,625
But you are a human being,

167
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:45,791
so you have to learn to
control yourself like one.

168
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:50,208
[MEI] Also, I don't know
what sort of ideas

169
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:52,416
you've gotten into your head,

170
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,166
but there's nothing between
Himeko and myself.

171
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:57,000
Then why did she say
all that stuff about

172
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:59,541
how you guys "crossed
some sort of line"?

173
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:01,458
[MEI] Himeko tried to do
something inappropriate

174
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:02,541
and I scolded her.

175
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:04,250
And that's all there is to it.

176
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:08,125
I'm sure she twisted
things to suit her purposes.

177
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:10,708
Though, you should have been
able to see through that.

178
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:12,833
[YUZU]
Good to hear!

179
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:16,208
[YUZU] Awesome! So I still have
a shot with her after all!

180
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,583
[MEI]
You seem to be happier now.

181
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:23,541
[YUZU]
You're happy too, right, Mei?

182
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:26,500
I mean, it's cool that your
dad sends you letters.

183
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:31,166
I bet he loves you a lot.

184
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:34,083
[YUZU]
Uh-oh.

185
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:35,416
Uh. Never mind that!

186
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,250
There's no reason to
think about it too hard.

187
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:38,500
You should just enjoy your crepe

188
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:40,875
and forget that I
even brought it up.

189
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:45,750
[YUZU]
Oh, yeah!

190
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:48,125
We could totally do that
indirect kiss thing!

191
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:50,708
This place is amazing.

192
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:52,791
All the desserts they make
here are so delicious.

193
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:54,708
Do you mind if I try a
bite of what you're--?

194
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:57,416
[YUZU]
She already finished it!

195
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,416
Well, you can at least
have a taste of mine!

196
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:08,583
Sure. I can sample a
little from this piece.

197
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:37,333
[YUZU]
Man. Why am I so hung up on Mei?

198
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:40,875
I think I love her.

199
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:42,916
I wanna kiss her.

200
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:46,791
So, uh, Mei?

201
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:48,875
Is it maybe okay with
you if we hold hands?

202
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,708
[HIMEKO]
Hold it right there!

203
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:01,083
[YUZU]
Oh my gosh, it's Momokino?

204
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:02,833
[HIMEKO]
So this is where you were!

205
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:05,041
How the heck did
you find us here?

206
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:06,375
Pucchi! Good dog.

207
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:07,458
[HIMEKO]
Don't think for a second

208
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:09,125
I'll let you get ahead
of me, Aihara!

209
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:10,458
[HIMEKO growls]

210
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:13,666
I'm certain you must've
forced the president

211
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:16,916
--to go out with you toda--
--[MEI] Himeko.

212
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,208
Did I say something wrong?

213
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:24,500
This is none of
your concern at all.

214
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:28,375
Stop deceiving Yuzu.
It's disgraceful.

215
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,750
Sorry, Mei-Mei.

216
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:33,500
[MEI]
Let's go.

217
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:35,458
[YUZU]
Uh, okay.

218
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:48,833
[YUZU]
This is the place.

219
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:58,666
[MEI] I didn't realize
your father had passed.

220
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,125
Oh, yeah.

221
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:03,041
He's been gone ever since
I was only three years old.

222
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:06,041
It's fine! I've made
my peace with it.

223
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:08,708
See? Look.

224
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:19,375
Papa, this is my little sister.

225
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:21,125
Let me introduce you to Mei.

226
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:22,250
Yeah, I know.

227
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:23,416
I guess it's kind of weird

228
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,416
since she is taller
and smarter than me,

229
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,291
but she's also pretty awkward
and rough around the edges too.

230
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:31,166
Anyway, what I'm really
trying to say to you is,

231
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,916
just like you've
always protected me,

232
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,375
now I have somebody to
protect and look after.

233
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:40,583
Well, I guess that
concludes today's mission!

234
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:42,125
You wanna get something to eat?

235
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:43,958
Oh, sorry!

236
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:57,208
[YUZU] Papa, I need you
to lend me some courage.

237
00:13:58,958 --> 00:13:59,875
[YUZU]
Mei!

238
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:01,458
I, uh, I want to--

239
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:06,125
The letters my father sent...
I've never opened them.

240
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:09,125
I'm afraid to find out
what he's thinking.

241
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:11,083
Because I'm worried
he may decide

242
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:14,125
not to return to the academy.

243
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:15,500
Is it possible?

244
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:19,708
Can I...? Can I be ever
close with him again?

245
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:22,625
[YUZU]
Uh.

246
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:24,125
Are you kidding? Why not?

247
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:25,791
I mean, you've got
me to help you!

248
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:28,333
We'll make it happen,
I promise you!

249
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,458
Guess it's time to go home.

250
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:53,416
[YUZU crying]

251
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:57,625
[YUZU] Man, after the
way she looked at me...

252
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:03,500
How can I kiss her now?

253
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:05,958
[YUZU] What Mei needs
right now isn't romance.

254
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:09,291
It's support. From her family.

255
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:19,125
[YUZU]
That's it.

256
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:20,666
I'm just gonna give
up on the love thing

257
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,750
and focus on being her sister.

258
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:24,833
[HIMEKO gasps]

259
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:26,250
[HIMEKO]
Are you hurt?

260
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:28,416
[MEI]
Keep your voice down, Himeko.

261
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,083
I just tripped.

262
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:33,583
I think, maybe
you're sick, President.

263
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,625
Perhaps you shouldn't attend
the meeting after all.

264
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:37,958
Don't be silly.
I have to be there.

265
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:40,416
[HIMEKO]
You look like you're burning up!

266
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,375
Let me get you some help.

267
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:44,083
Drop it, Himeko!

268
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:47,166
It's not like you
can take my place!

269
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:51,916
Hold up! That was rude,
even for you!

270
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,291
She's only getting on your
case because she's worried!

271
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:59,166
Yes, I'm aware. I don't
need you to tell me... that.

272
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,333
--[HIMEKO] Oh, no!
--[YUZU] Whoa, watch out!

273
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:03,000
[HIMEKO]
She fainted!

274
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:05,458
Stay here! I'll go
get the nurse!

275
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:06,541
[YUZU]
Wait!

276
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:08,208
Isn't that council
meeting important?

277
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:09,416
You should go.

278
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,333
Well, yes, but that's
not the issue here!

279
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:13,791
[YUZU]
Maybe not,

280
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:17,500
but I bet it's the biggest
thing on Mei's mind.

281
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:20,416
Please, Momokino,
do it for her.

282
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:25,500
[HIMEKO]
If you insist.

283
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:36,333
[MEI]
Where am I?

284
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:37,875
[YUZU]
Nurse's office.

285
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:39,333
You have a fever,

286
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:42,958
so you need to rest at least
until the nurse gets back.

287
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:45,208
No, you're not going anywhere!

288
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:47,208
The student council's waiting!

289
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:49,083
And then there's
a board meeting!

290
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:50,791
I need to be there!

291
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:53,916
All those things are exactly
what made you pass out!

292
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,041
It's just like with Gramps.

293
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:57,541
[MEI]
I've heard enough. Let me go!

294
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:02,208
You might as well give up.

295
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:08,000
[YUZU] I'm sorry I made you
go with me to see my papa.

296
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:10,250
Some sister I am.

297
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:13,041
[MEI]
Oh? You're being sisterly now?

298
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:15,625
Don't worry. It was my decision.

299
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:17,666
You don't have to apologize.

300
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:20,833
[YUZU] Why have you been working
yourself practically to death?

301
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:22,458
I mean, most teenagers
in high school

302
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,375
don't even have to work at all.

303
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:26,083
[MEI]
I'm the successor.

304
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:27,750
Who cares about that?

305
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:31,666
You're a teenager! Can't your
dad help with that stuff?

306
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:32,833
Hey, I know!

307
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:34,166
Your dad can be the successor.

308
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,375
There's no reason
you should have to

309
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:37,500
bust your butt like
this, you know?

310
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:39,166
Huh?

311
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,583
I actually agree with you.

312
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:43,041
You're always running
your mouth,

313
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:46,666
but once in a while,
you make a legitimate point.

314
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:47,958
It's only temporary, though.

315
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:49,291
When the time comes,

316
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:51,958
I know all this struggling
will have been worth it.

317
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:57,041
[YUZU]
He must be really special.

318
00:17:57,125 --> 00:18:01,125
She's never looked at me
with that much love before.

319
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:03,541
If I can be the best,
most supportive big sister

320
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,041
in the world,

321
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:08,000
I wonder if she'll start to
see me in a different light.

322
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:11,208
Well, anyway, we're gonna
get that fever down

323
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,458
so you can be healthy and
back in action real soon,

324
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:16,208
and I'll start by taking
your bags down.

325
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:18,791
Oh, yeah! As far as Momokino...

326
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:20,208
What about her?

327
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:22,125
[YUZU] I'm sure your fever
probably had you all hazy,

328
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:25,666
but you still said some super
mean stuff to that girl.

329
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:28,541
You need to apologize
as soon as you're well.

330
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:36,208
Seriously, make up with her.
We've got a theme park to go to!

331
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:43,875
What was that about?

332
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:47,166
[YUZU] Mei obviously needs
her dad to be with her.

333
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:50,458
Why's he out traveling
the world anyway?

334
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:51,583
[YUZU]
Huh?

335
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:01,875
[HIMEKO] Mei-Mei's always
been the kind of person

336
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:04,000
to shoulder all of her
problems on her own,

337
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:06,291
ever since she was
a little girl.

338
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:09,875
I knew for a fact she was
feeling under the weather...

339
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:12,458
...but I couldn't mention it.

340
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:14,000
If you ask me,
you're a lot like her

341
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:15,583
when it comes to
taking on too much.

342
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:17,250
So maybe try cutting
yourself some slack

343
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:18,250
for once in your life.

344
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:20,125
Yeah, that's easy
for you to say.

345
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:23,083
Not everyone can be
as flippant as you are.

346
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,250
[YUZU] What Mei needs
right now isn't romance.

347
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:33,708
It's support. From her family.

348
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:39,000
Yeah, right. I only wish I could
be so flippant about all this.

349
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:45,375
[MEI sighs]

350
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:31,583
[HIMEKO crying]

351
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:33,583
[HIMEKO]
Mei-Mei!

352
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:36,833
[YUZU] Letting go of your
feelings for someone

353
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:39,125
because you love them...

354
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:48,291
[YUZU] This is more complicated
than I ever imagined.

355
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:55,500
You know, I should sign
up for student council.

356
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:58,375
Maybe then I could help
lighten the load for everyone.

357
00:20:58,458 --> 00:20:59,833
If we had you there,

358
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:02,416
then we'd be dealing
with even more trouble.

359
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,666
Here's a thought.

360
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:06,750
Follow the rules before
trying to enforce them.

361
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:09,916
Well, fine, I see how it is.

362
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,416
[door opens]

363
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,291
[YUZU]
Mom?

364
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:15,708
Hey, how was your day? Uh.

365
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:19,416
[YUZU]
What the--?

366
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:22,333
[SHOU]
Surprise!

367
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:23,833
I've finally returned!

368
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:25,166
Uh, who are you?

369
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:26,916
[SHOU]
Ah, you must be Yuzu.

370
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,708
Yeah, but I don't know
who the heck you are.

371
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:32,833
Your mom's right!
You are so adorable!

372
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:35,958
[SHOU laughs]

373
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:37,375
[SHOU] I was wondering
when I'd get to meet

374
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:39,750
the spunky girl I've
heard so much about!

375
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:40,833
C'mere, you!

376
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:43,041
[YUZU]
What are you doing in my house?

377
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:45,458
Take those grubby hands off me
or I'm calling the cops!

378
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:47,208
How do you know my name, anyway?

379
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:49,208
Are you some kind of
psycho stalker creep?

380
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:51,833
Seriously, you need to let
me go or you'll regret it!

381
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:55,000
I swear, you're about to
be in a world of pain!

382
00:21:57,666 --> 00:22:00,708
Uh, Professor?

383
00:23:32,291 --> 00:23:34,625
What? This perv
is your father?

384
00:23:34,708 --> 00:23:37,250
That means, he's my father, too!

385
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:38,833
[MEI]
It doesn't matter now.

386
00:23:38,916 --> 00:23:41,000
Stop trying to do
everything alone!

387
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:44,041
Tell me honestly, Yuzu.
You do need me, don't you?


388
00:23:44,125 --> 00:23:46,875
[YUZU] There's gotta be
some way I can help Mei.
