1
00:00:10,791 --> 00:00:13,500
[MANAMI] Oh, yeah, he was being
a pain, so I dumped him.

2
00:00:13,583 --> 00:00:15,083
[KANA]
What? Already?

3
00:00:15,166 --> 00:00:18,333
Weren't you guys still hooking
up just like a couple days ago?

4
00:00:18,416 --> 00:00:20,458
[MANAMI] Eh, summer's the
season of love, right?

5
00:00:20,541 --> 00:00:22,125
I'll get a rebound soon enough.

6
00:00:22,208 --> 00:00:23,375
[YUZU sighs]

7
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:27,291
[YUZU]
God, I hate being single.

8
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:28,750
[MANAMI]
Wait, didn't you just break up

9
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:30,375
with your boyfriend, Yuzucchi?

10
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:31,750
I'd say come to the
mixer if you weren't

11
00:00:31,833 --> 00:00:32,791
transferring in the fall,

12
00:00:32,875 --> 00:00:34,458
but who'd want a
long distance thing?

13
00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:35,333
[KANA]
Not me.

14
00:00:35,416 --> 00:00:36,791
Ew. They're the worst.

15
00:00:36,875 --> 00:00:39,166
Don't even worry
about me, ladies.

16
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:43,166
They'll be a new hot guy.
There always is, am I right?

17
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:19,750
[YUZU humming]


18
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:36,291
[YUZU] It's nice being able to
change in a room this big!

19
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:38,333
[laughs]

20
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:43,375
[humming]

21
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,208
[groans]

22
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:56,125
[YUZU humming]

23
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:14,791
[humming continues]

24
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:30,833
Hot!

25
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:36,833
I haven't learned any
of this stuff yet.

26
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:38,791
Whatever, high school
girls only need to know

27
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:41,375
fashion and friends!

28
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:45,166
Aw, thanks, Mom!

29
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,083
I'm heading out now!

30
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:55,916
[YUZU]
The summer of my freshman year,

31
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,333
my mom kinda up and found
herself a new husband.

32
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:02,000
Because of that, we had
to move to a new town,

33
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:03,541
meaning I had to
start life all over

34
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:05,875
at a totally different
high school.

35
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:15,166
[YUZU]
If I want to be at the top

36
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,666
of the social food chain here,

37
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,708
I've gotta crank my
cuteness up to 11!

38
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:22,083
[SCHOOLGIRL A]
Oh, hi, there you are.

39
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:23,000
[SCHOOLGIRL C]
Hey, wait for me!

40
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:24,250
[SCHOOLGIRL D]
What's up?

41
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:31,416
[YUZU]
Of course, it doesn't matter

42
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,291
how much I pump myself
up about it, anyway...

43
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:40,875
[YUZU] ...because my new
school is an all girls' school.

44
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:44,000
It's just gonna be
downhill from here.

45
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:46,833
I've kept up the
charade until now.

46
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:50,000
Yeah, after the mixer, we
totally went to second base!

47
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:50,708
What?

48
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,458
Wow!

49
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:56,416
[YUZU]
But the truth is...

50
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,208
...I've never been
in love before.

51
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:04,166
When I do get my first kiss...
I hope it's super hot,

52
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:07,708
like in a romance manga!

53
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:10,208
Not that I could ever admit it.

54
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:13,666
I'm beyond clueless about love.

55
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,458
[MARUTA]
Um. Please excuse me.

56
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:17,291
Okay.

57
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:18,583
I'm sorry to bother you,

58
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:21,041
but would you mind showing
me your student ID?

59
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:22,875
Huh? What for?

60
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:24,625
[MARUTA]
Your hair color is in violation

61
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:26,208
of our school's dress code.

62
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:27,625
[gasps]

63
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:29,458
Not only that, but cell phone
use is prohibited here,

64
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:31,750
so I'll have to confiscate
yours now, please.

65
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:34,500
[YUZU] No way! I literally
just transferred here.

66
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:36,916
You can't punish me
if I didn't know.

67
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:38,958
Let me slide?

68
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:40,750
[HIMEKO]
Sorry, we can't make exceptions.

69
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:43,541
That sets a bad example
for the other girls.

70
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:45,625
But isn't this perm
against the rules?

71
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:47,416
It's my natural hair, thank you!

72
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,958
Will you stop touching it?

73
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:50,958
[MARUTA]
Actually, there's more.

74
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:53,291
Your top button. Makeup as well.

75
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:54,833
Plus, that red ribbon.

76
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:58,708
Blouse, jewelry, false
nails, bag, skirt length.

77
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:02,291
In fact, your entire
appearance is a violation.

78
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:03,791
Huh?!

79
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:10,458
[YUZU]
What kind of crap high school

80
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:12,500
doesn't let their
girls look cute?

81
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:14,541
You're screwing up
the whole point!

82
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:15,875
[HARUMI]
Hmm...

83
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:16,500
[HIMEKO]
Back off!

84
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:18,041
This is so stupid!

85
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:20,000
It's not like how you dress
makes any difference

86
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:21,333
in your grades anyway!

87
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:23,541
[MEI]
It does, though.

88
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:25,083
[HIMEKO]
President!

89
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:27,541
[MEI] Our rules are
extremely important.

90
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:30,375
They prepare us not just for
school, but for the real world.

91
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:32,416
Every student at this
academy will be held

92
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,916
to the exact same standard.

93
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,333
If you have a problem with that,

94
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:39,041
perhaps you don't
belong at this school.

95
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:43,333
I'm just saying it's silly.

96
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:45,291
If you're gonna be sticklers
about your dress code,

97
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:47,875
you should at least let
people know what it is.

98
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:53,750
Well, Student Council President,
what do you have say about that?

99
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:58,125
Exactly. I figured as much.

100
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:01,333
[YUZU gasps]

101
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:05,583
[YUZU]
Hey! What are you doing?

102
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,833
[MEI] I expect this won't
happen again tomorrow.

103
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:29,041
[YUZU]
Whoa.

104
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:32,666
What the hell was that? No fair!

105
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,625
[groans]

106
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:44,333
[AMAMIYA]
Hey! Aihara!

107
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:47,458
No makeup? This blows.

108
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:52,333
What a creep.

109
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:54,750
She smelled really nice, though.

110
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,458
It's probably her shampoo.

111
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:02,000
[AMAMIYA]
Aihara!

112
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:04,125
Um, you calling me?

113
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:07,708
[AMAMIYA]
I am. Are you feeling okay?

114
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:10,541
[YUZU]
That's what I'm talkin' about!

115
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:11,083
[AMAMIYA]
Hm?

116
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:12,666
Oh, uh, nothing!

117
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,875
I'm just not quite used to my
new last name yet, that's all.

118
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:17,708
I'm Mr. Amamiya.

119
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:20,125
Now follow me.
It's time for homeroom.

120
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,125
Yes, sir!

121
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:22,791
[YUZU giggles]

122
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:26,416
Whoopsie!

123
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:45,541
[YUZU] This place has been
like boot camp so far.

124
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,458
That said, if all the
teachers are that cute,

125
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:49,625
I might just be okay!

126
00:08:57,125 --> 00:09:00,250
[YUZU] First things first, I'm
gonna make some new friends!

127
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,500
[YUZU grunts]

128
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:09,750
There's no club today.

129
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:10,583
[SCHOOLGIRL F]
Oh?

130
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:12,000
[YUZU]
Hey there!

131
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:13,583
What are we doin', girls?

132
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:16,958
[SCHOOLGIRL E] Um, well, we were
thinking about maybe going to--

133
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:19,166
Oh, yeah! Karaoke sounds fun!

134
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:20,416
I don't have any
friends here yet,

135
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,583
so I'd totally be free
to tag along with you!

136
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:23,708
What time?

137
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:25,125
Don't make eye contact.

138
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:27,375
I'm scared to talk
to her, y'know?

139
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:30,333
[YUZU]
What's their problem?

140
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:31,083
[YUZU gasps]

141
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:32,666
[HARUMI]
'Scuse us a sec.

142
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:35,583
[HARUMI]
Listen, Aihara,

143
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:38,041
that's not how people
make friends here.

144
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:40,041
[YUZU]
Right. I'm sorry.

145
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:40,958
You are...?

146
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:42,750
[HARUMI]
I'm Harumi Taniguchi.

147
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:44,458
But just call me Harumin!

148
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:46,291
Uh. Harumin.

149
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:48,291
Anyway, what'd I do wrong?

150
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:50,500
[HARUMI] This school's part
of an escalator system,

151
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:52,500
so most of these
sheltered little flowers

152
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:54,166
have been classmates
since elementary.

153
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:55,791
I started here in
high school, though,

154
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:57,750
so I'm pretty much in
the same boat as you.

155
00:09:57,833 --> 00:09:59,333
Kindred spirits!

156
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:01,958
Wow, I guess you are like me.

157
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:04,375
Point is, the girls at this
academy have been trained

158
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:06,958
to watch their Ps
and Qs since day one.

159
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:09,041
The chairman runs a
pretty tight ship.

160
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:12,708
In other words, it's
the only way they know.

161
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:14,541
[YUZU]
That makes sense.

162
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:17,083
[HARUMI] Of course,
there is one special case.

163
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:18,458
[YUZU]
Special case?

164
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:20,375
[HARUMI] The beautiful
brainiac who made president

165
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:23,125
during her first year
of high school.

166
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:26,375
I heard she's engaged to one
of the top teachers here, too.

167
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:27,916
She's engaged?

168
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,583
Isn't she a little young
for that, though?

169
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:32,541
No, not if you're the
chairman's granddaughter

170
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:34,750
who's supposed to inherit
the school one day.

171
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:36,458
Whoa.

172
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:37,791
[YUZU]
I bet she's never had a chance

173
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:40,750
to date or fall in love, either.

174
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:42,125
[HARUMI]
Anyway, you're up to speed.

175
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,833
I'm gonna go ahead and
assume we're friends.

176
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:46,666
So what's your contact info?

177
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:50,250
A cell phone! They
confiscated mine. No fair.

178
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:53,250
They can't take it away
if they don't know it's there!

179
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:54,750
Let's see, if the
student council

180
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:58,000
hasn't given it
back to you yet...

181
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:00,958
...I'd say it probably
ended up in Mineko's room.

182
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:02,208
[YUZU]
Who?

183
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:04,291
[MINEKO] A lady must
always conduct herself

184
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:06,416
with the utmost
sophistication and poise,

185
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,541
not only at school,
but in the home as well.

186
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:11,958
Do I make myself
clear, Miss Aihada?

187
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:12,833
[YUZU]
Yes.

188
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:14,000
What on earth would possess you

189
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:16,000
to parade around our
prestigious academy

190
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:17,416
dressed in that shameful manner?

191
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,333
When I was your age,
I would've been embarrassed

192
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:21,125
at the very idea of
being seen in public

193
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:23,125
with my uniform in such
a state of disarray!

194
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:24,833
Honestly, how could
any respectable person

195
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:27,458
expect to be taken seriously
with that ridiculous hair color?

196
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:30,500
And let's not forget
about that phone, too!

197
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:31,750
Hm?

198
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:34,916
You're ignoring me,
aren't you, dear?

199
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,750
[YUZU]
Sorry.

200
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:39,125
Respect for rules and order
is one of the cornerstones

201
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:41,458
upon which this proud
establishment was built,

202
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:44,625
and if you think our
distinguished faculty...

203
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,916
[YUZU]
That was brutal.

204
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,875
Hope I never get old and lame.

205
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:53,208
[sighs]

206
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,666
At least I got my phone back!

207
00:11:57,916 --> 00:11:59,000
[YUZU]
Hm?

208
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:10,958
[YUZU]
Huh?

209
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:14,666
Oh, look! It's Mr. Hot Teacher!

210
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:17,250
I'm gonna get his contact info.

211
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:19,541
[YUZU chuckles]

212
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:21,291
[YUZU]
Mr. Amamiya!

213
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:35,875
[gasps]

214
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:46,208
[YUZU]
Tell me I'm not seeing this!

215
00:12:57,875 --> 00:12:59,250
[gasps]

216
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,416
[YUZU]
I don't believe it!

217
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,875
The president and
Mr. Amamiya?

218
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:19,833
[YUZU]
Plus...

219
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:26,125
[YUZU]
She totally knows I saw them!

220
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:28,875
[HARUMI]
Uh?

221
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:31,208
What's up, Yuzucchi?
Did you get your--?

222
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:39,083
Mineko must've torn
her a new one.

223
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:48,458
What a day.
That was so crazy.

224
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:53,375
[YUZU]
I'm home.

225
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,333
[YUZU]
Well, that's kinda weird.

226
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:59,041
[UME]
Yuzu!

227
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:02,166
What took you so long, sweetie?
I've been waiting forever.

228
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,750
[YUZU]
Sorry. Something came up.

229
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:07,791
[UME] You promised you would
help me clean up after the move.

230
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:10,083
Yeah, I know. I will.

231
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:14,791
So, do I finally get to
meet my new dad tonight?

232
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:17,458
Oh, about that.

233
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:20,416
He sort of had to leave for
the other side of the world.

234
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,166
[YUZU]
Huh?

235
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,791
He won't be back
home for a while.

236
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:26,166
That's too bad.

237
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,583
I was looking forward to
seeing what kind of creeper

238
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,166
you're bringing into the house.

239
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:32,375
I mean, you do have a
history of dating weirdoes.

240
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:33,791
[UME]
Hm?

241
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,208
[YUZU]
This is a lot.

242
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:38,625
[UME]
Is it?

243
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:42,166
Well, growing girls need
plenty of nourishment, right?

244
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:43,166
[YUZU]
Hey, Mom?

245
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,333
[UME]
Hm?

246
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:46,541
[YUZU] Be honest with
me. Are you happy?

247
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:49,041
Oh, yes. Very much so.

248
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,416
[YUZU] Okay. If you're
happy, then I'm happy.

249
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:06,583
Of course I'm happy.

250
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:12,541
[UME]
Why wouldn't I be, sweetie?

251
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:15,875
After all, I've got my two
beautiful girls here with me.

252
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:18,125
[YUZU]
What? Two?

253
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,083
[UME] Oh? Did I forget
to mention that?

254
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:23,916
Surprise! You get to
have a new sister!

255
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:36,958
[MEI]
I'm home.

256
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:38,500
[YUZU gasps]

257
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,041
[YUZU yelps]

258
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:47,458
Why are you in my house?

259
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:48,791
Because I live here.

260
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:50,833
My name's Mei Aihara.

261
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:52,875
I'm Shou's daughter.

262
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:55,666
It's so nice to
meet you, Mother.

263
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:58,500
Oh, hell no! That's
my mom, not yours!

264
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:01,333
Aw, there's no need to be
so formal with me, honey!

265
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:03,416
We're a family now, remember?

266
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,041
[gasping]

267
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:07,833
[UME]
Be nice to your sister, Yuzu.

268
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:10,125
Have you been doing council
work all afternoon?

269
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:11,708
[MEI]
Yes, I'm always busy.

270
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:13,041
[UME]
What a hard worker!

271
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:14,625
You must be starving!

272
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:17,333
Well, we went all out to cook
you something delicious, Mei!

273
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:19,083
You're too kind.

274
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:21,916
[UME] Yuzu's birthday is first,
so she's the big sister.

275
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,833
That means you're the baby, Mei!

276
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,416
[MEI]
Okay.

277
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,416
You must be glad to have such a
cute little sister, right, Yuzu?

278
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,541
[YUZU]
Uhh...

279
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:36,333
[YUZU] Yeah, her death
glare's real cute.

280
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:37,333
[UME]
Aww.

281
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:39,750
And so shy. Isn't that adorable?

282
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:42,041
[YUZU]
Trust me, she is not adorable!

283
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:43,625
[chuckles]

284
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:45,958
[YUZU]
Ugh, I cannot deal with this!

285
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:50,583
[UME]
Yuzu, stop eating so fast.

286
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:52,750
Hey! I'm a growing girl!

287
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:54,666
[UME]
Well, that was awkward.

288
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,625
Sorry, Mei. Poor thing.

289
00:16:56,708 --> 00:16:57,333
[MEI]
It's fine.

290
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:58,750
Anyway, remind me:

291
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:00,291
You were living with
your grandfather

292
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:01,708
before now, weren't you?

293
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:05,000
[MEI] No. I've been staying
in my father's house.

294
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:08,000
[UME] Really? But your
dad's always traveling.

295
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:10,750
You must have been by
yourself for a while.

296
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:13,416
[YUZU]
Hm?

297
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,875
[MEI] I haven't really seen my
father in almost five years.

298
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:18,041
[UME gasps]

299
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:21,916
[UME] Has it been hard
living alone at your age?

300
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,416
[MEI]
Not so much. My grandfather's...

301
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:27,291
[YUZU] So she's been living
by herself this whole time?

302
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:29,583
I bet she was lonely.

303
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:31,375
[UME]
Ah.

304
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:32,916
Yes, of course,

305
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,875
your grandfather is also the
chairman of your high school.

306
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:38,666
He's the one who owns that big
famous mansion over by Rikugien.

307
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,625
[MEI] I don't visit
his estate very often,

308
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:42,041
so I know very
little about it...

309
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:44,708
[YUZU] Wait, if she's
seriously my sister,

310
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:48,708
that makes me the chairman's
granddaughter, too!

311
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:52,333
Sweet, I always wanted
to be filthy rich!

312
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:55,333
[YUZU grunts]

313
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:57,916
[MEI]
Idiot.

314
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:14,541
[sighs]

315
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:16,416
I'm so tired.

316
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:25,625
[YUZU] How could Mom just
spring this whole thing on me?

317
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:30,125
And how could that girl act
so normal at the dinner table...

318
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:32,291
...after what I saw?

319
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:37,875
[YUZU] Sure was an interesting
face she was making.

320
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:47,041
Does kissing really
feel that special?

321
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:48,583
[gasps]

322
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:52,125
[YUZU] Wait! Why am I playing
it over and over in my head?

323
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:05,416
[YUZU]
Jeez, what's the matter with me?

324
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:17,875
Hey, the bathroom's free now.

325
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:29,958
[YUZU]
Aw!

326
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:31,666
That's a cute bear.

327
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,333
So, do you like--? Oh.

328
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:46,500
Okay, look, I know you and
I didn't exactly get off

329
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:48,541
on the right foot earlier.

330
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:51,250
But now we're stepsisters,

331
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:53,916
so we're gonna have
to get along somehow.

332
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,583
Or at least try, right?

333
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:57,666
We'll fake it if we have to.

334
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:07,916
[YUZU]
She's ignoring me?

335
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,375
All right then,
Little Miss Perfect,

336
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,583
if that's how you wanna play...

337
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:16,208
[YUZU]
So...

338
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:18,583
You made out with the
teacher today, huh?

339
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:19,666
You'd think there'd be a rule

340
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,958
against student
teacher hookups, too.

341
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:23,000
I totally get it.

342
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:24,541
You make out with
him in the open

343
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:27,125
because knowing you might get
caught makes it even hotter.

344
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:31,000
Now, if you ask me, I'd bet
that kiss was your first.

345
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:32,625
So, what was it like, anyway?

346
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:34,500
I always pictured it
to be really magical,

347
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:37,333
like confessing your feelings
without saying a wor--

348
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:32,958
[MEI]
It felt like that.

349
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,083
Magical enough for you?

350
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:50,541
What the--?

351
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:54,500
[YUZU] I've dreamed about
my first kiss for so long...

352
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:57,083
[YUZU]
What is wrong with her?

353
00:21:57,166 --> 00:22:01,666
[YUZU] And it was just stolen
from me... by my own sister!

354
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:34,458
[YUZU]
She had to go and kiss me.

355
00:23:34,541 --> 00:23:36,208
[MEI] A child who's never
been kissed before

356
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:37,833
shouldn't act like she has.

357
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:40,041
[YUZU
Because of me, she's...

358
00:23:40,125 --> 00:23:41,791
[MEI] I just wanna know
if you're gonna rescue me

359
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:44,208
from my mean
grandfather's house.
