1
00:01:41,125 --> 00:01:42,666
[MEI]
Trespassing again?


2
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,416
[MATSURI]
Aw, that's not nice.

3
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,083
So I don't even get a hello?

4
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:50,291
And after I waited for you
in the cold this whole time.

5
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:55,208
Come on, you know you
wanna warm me up.

6
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:58,250
Just like you did for
Yuzu at the bus stop.

7
00:01:59,458 --> 00:02:00,708
[gasps]

8
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,291
[MATSURI] You know, at
first I was thinking about

9
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:09,541
paying you back for that
cute little stunt you pulled

10
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:12,500
by doing something
naughty to you, too.

11
00:02:12,583 --> 00:02:14,583
But then I realized that
you're a dirty slut

12
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:16,250
who goes around
kissing everybody,

13
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:20,041
so then, it's not really a
punishment but more of a reward.

14
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:22,250
Stop messing around already.

15
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:23,500
[MATSURI]
Here.

16
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:26,458
I decided to bring you
a little present, Mei.

17
00:02:26,541 --> 00:02:27,625
Check it out.

18
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:30,291
It's a pretty good
shot, isn't it?

19
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:32,416
Just tell me what you're after.

20
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,875
[MATSURI]
But I already did.

21
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:38,541
I want you to keep your
nasty mitts off my Yuzu.

22
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:41,625
[MATSURI]
Obviously, you weren't listening

23
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:44,000
the first time I warned you.

24
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:46,916
Well, I guess I shouldn't
expect a whore like you

25
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,041
to be able to control
her urges, should I?

26
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:52,416
You may try to act
all prim and proper,

27
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,125
but I can tell you're
just a huge tramp.

28
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:57,791
[MATSURI laughs]

29
00:02:57,875 --> 00:03:00,125
Luckily, there's no need to
worry about that, though.

30
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:01,875
I came up with a solution.

31
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:05,000
I know somebody who'd
be perfect for you.

32
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:08,708
This way, you'll have an outlet
for all that pent-up energy.

33
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:16,416
[MATSURI] You're gonna get to
play with one of my clients.

34
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:20,041
I'd do it myself, but this
guy thinks I'm older

35
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:22,625
from the fake photos
I've sent to him.

36
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:24,000
Don't be sad, Mei.

37
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:25,791
There are plenty of other
lonely people out there

38
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:27,666
who'd love to touch you.

39
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:32,500
I hope you like the
present I got you.

40
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:34,750
Oh, and by the way,

41
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:38,625
if you decide to be ungrateful
and turn it down, well,

42
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:43,583
this picture might go to someone
you don't want seeing it.

43
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:46,166
Come on, you're a
pretty smart girl.

44
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:49,375
I'm sure you'll make
the right choice.

45
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:08,083
[MEI] She won't go back
to the way she was.

46
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:09,000
[MATSURI]
Yeah, that's okay.

47
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:12,708
She'll always be
my older sister.

48
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:15,000
Nothing else really matters.

49
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:21,083
[YUZU]
Aw, man, I screwed it up again!

50
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:22,625
[groans]

51
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:24,958
What's wrong with me?

52
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:26,666
I'm home, Yuz--

53
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:31,291
What happened?

54
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:33,541
I'm a failure.

55
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:35,041
That's a lot of tries.

56
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:38,166
Yeah, it turns out the cake
is the hardest part for me.

57
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,125
I don't mind grabbing
one from the store.

58
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:41,625
[YUZU]
No way!

59
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:44,458
I promised myself I would make
it from scratch this year!

60
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:45,541
I dunno.

61
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:47,583
Maybe the oven
temperature's not right.

62
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:51,250
I waited for it to preheat,
so that can't be it.

63
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,791
And I measured everything
just like it says.

64
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:55,333
Guess I didn't mix it enough.

65
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:58,083
[UME] I can tell this is gonna
be a Christmas to remember.

66
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:13,375
Tah-dah!

67
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:19,791
Aw, it's adorable! You
did a great job, sweetie!

68
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:21,666
Maybe I should stop buying
these and just have you...

69
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,250
[YUZU]
This Christmas is big.

70
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:25,416
It's the first one
with Mei here.

71
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:29,000
I hope the cake makes
her super happy.

72
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:30,291
[YUZU giggles]

73
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:31,500
[YUZU] Yeah, I went around
to different stores

74
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:34,333
looking for one Mei would like.

75
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:36,625
Look at that sweet face!

76
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:37,791
Welcome back, Mei!

77
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:39,958
Hey there, how was
student council?

78
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:42,750
Did you girls get
a lot of work done?

79
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:44,916
[YUZU] We're setting things
up for the Christmas party!

80
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,125
Anything special
you wanna eat?

81
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:49,500
Just let me know and I can pick
it up when I go shopping lat--

82
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:51,375
Sorry.

83
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:53,416
I hate to ruin your plans,

84
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,125
but there's still a great
deal of work left to do

85
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:57,791
for the student council.

86
00:05:57,875 --> 00:05:59,958
I was looking forward
to tomorrow night,

87
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:01,583
but I'll have to cancel.

88
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:03,166
[YUZU]
What?

89
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,500
[UME]
Oh, no!

90
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:08,041
You have to stay at school
on Christmas? Really?

91
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:10,083
Are you sure you
just can't ditch it?

92
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:12,333
[UME]
Yuzu, don't guilt her.

93
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:13,458
[YUZU]
I'm not.

94
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:15,500
Please excuse me.

95
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:23,416
[sighs]

96
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,666
I was so excited about
Christmas, too.

97
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,625
Hey, I'm done. You can
have the bathroom now.

98
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:35,333
[MEI]
Good to know. Thank you.

99
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:41,083
Listen. Mei.

100
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:44,375
Are you sure you can't take
the day off tomorrow?

101
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:46,625
Just push it to the next day.

102
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:49,416
Oh, I guess that's
winter break, isn't it?

103
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:54,583
[MEI] Unfortunately, it's
something that can't wait.

104
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:03,333
Okay.

105
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:05,500
[YUZU]
I sound like a bratty kid.

106
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:06,875
[phone dings]

107
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,250
It's from Matsuri.

108
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:18,125
She wants to go out tomorrow.

109
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:20,958
A date, huh? On
Christmas day no less?

110
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:22,583
Jeez, doesn't she
have anybody else

111
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:23,916
she wants to hang out with?

112
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,791
[MEI]
Yuzu.

113
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:26,583
Uh-huh? What is it?

114
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:29,583
Go out with her.
She wants to see you.

115
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:36,166
That girl needs you, so you
shouldn't let her down.

116
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:45,250
[YUZU]
Matsuri needs me?

117
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:47,500
What did she mean by that?

118
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:49,625
[HARUMI]
Yuzu-chi!

119
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:53,250
[YUZU yells]

120
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:55,458
Ouch, Harumin.
What was that for?

121
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:57,500
[HARUMI]
You don't remember?

122
00:07:57,583 --> 00:07:59,416
We were supposed
to walk together!

123
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,708
But you sit on a throne of lies!

124
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,291
Uh, what does that mean?

125
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:05,875
Anyway, I'm sorry.
I didn't hear you ask me to!

126
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:07,500
[HARUMI sighs]

127
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:08,916
You're all decked
out for Christmas,

128
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,416
but you don't seem to be
full of the holiday spirit.

129
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,541
Oh.

130
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:15,041
So what's the matter?

131
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:18,416
Well, it's just... Mei can't
come to the Christmas party.

132
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,375
Whoa. Not taking off?

133
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,708
I gotta admit, the
girl's got gumption.

134
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:25,125
Yeah, apparently there was
no getting out of it.

135
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:27,250
That's sounds awful.
Anyway, bye!

136
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:31,250
What? Harumin, wait!
You're going without me?

137
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:33,833
[HARUMI] I know you.
You're staying here.

138
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:34,916
[gasps]

139
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,958
[HARUMI]
Student council's not my scene.

140
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:38,708
See ya!

141
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:43,041
[YUZU]
That's it!

142
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:50,791
[YUZU]
Might as well give it a shot!

143
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:54,583
[MATSURI]
Yuzu!

144
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:02,500
I never got a yes or no from
you yesterday, so here I am!

145
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:05,208
Matsuri?

146
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:07,833
Uh, come with me!

147
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:11,833
[YUZU] I told you not to
show up here out of the blue!

148
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:13,166
What if someone saw you?

149
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,916
[MATSURI] Aw. You're such
a widdle worry wart!

150
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,625
Hey, why didn't you
respond to my message?

151
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:20,000
I dunno.

152
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:21,458
I wasn't sure what my schedule

153
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:23,708
was gonna be for
today, that's all.

154
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:27,041
Yeah? I guess that excuse
maybe kinda makes sense.

155
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:31,541
But you know your schedule
by now, don't you?

156
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:34,500
So let's go on a date together.

157
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:37,458
[YUZU]
Mh-hm.

158
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:38,958
Sure, I'm free.

159
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:42,958
[MATSURI] Yay! I know just
the place I want to take you!

160
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,750
[YUZU] This is what
you wanted, right, Mei?

161
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:41,916
[giggles]

162
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,791
I haven't seen you
this happy in forever.

163
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:46,000
Who knew you liked
strawberry cake that much?

164
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:47,416
[MATSURI laughs]

165
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,875
Well, yeah, sure. the cake
here is pretty incredible.

166
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:55,083
But that's not the only reason
I'm in such a good mood.

167
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:57,458
[YUZU]
Huh? What do you mean?

168
00:10:57,541 --> 00:11:01,750
[MATSURI] 'Cause I finally
get you all to myself.

169
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:06,458
That's so sweet.

170
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:07,875
It's kinda funny,

171
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:10,208
I've been practicing my
baking skills a lot recently.

172
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:13,750
So you'd think I would be
totally sick of cake after that.

173
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:17,916
[YUZU] But I'm scarfing
this thing down like crazy!

174
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,083
Wow. Did you make
a Christmas cake?

175
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:23,666
I'm surprised you didn't just
buy it from the store this year.

176
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,000
[YUZU]
Right?

177
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:27,875
It's super tricky getting
that fluffy consistency!

178
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:32,541
We never had homemade cake
when I used to go there.

179
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:33,916
[YUZU]
Uh?

180
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,625
[MATSURI]
Eh, nothing.

181
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:37,000
That reminds me.

182
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:38,750
We did Christmas
together all the time

183
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:41,250
back when we were
kids, didn't we?

184
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:55,291
[YUZU] Your parents
were always working,

185
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:57,541
so you would play by yourself.

186
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:03,333
[YUZU]
One day, I decided to say hi.

187
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:13,958
[BOTH gasp]

188
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:21,000
[BOTH giggle]

189
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:23,583
[giggling]

190
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:26,375
[YUZU]
That was the first day you and I

191
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:29,666
started acting like sisters.

192
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,833
Oh, yeah, speaking
of your parents,

193
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:34,083
are they still busy
with work these days?

194
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:35,250
[MATSURI]
Uh-huh.

195
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:36,791
Honestly, my mom and
dad are more married

196
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:38,875
to their dumb careers than
they are to each other.

197
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:40,583
Gee, that's a bummer.

198
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:42,041
Hey, how 'bout this?

199
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:44,375
Why don't you come celebrate
Christmas with our family?

200
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:46,833
it'll be just like the old days!

201
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:51,708
Let's make sure we're
on the same page.

202
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:55,125
Are you asking me to come
as your little sister?

203
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:56,458
[YUZU]
Mh-hm.

204
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:58,166
I think Mom's gonna be so
glad to see you again.

205
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:01,083
Oh, and Mei would probably
love for you to come over.

206
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:03,208
That way, she'll have
even more family.

207
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:04,708
[chuckles]

208
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,458
[MATSURI]
Sure, as long as Mei's happy.

209
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:12,458
Mei this, Mei that.

210
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,291
Don't you ever talk
about anything else?

211
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:15,750
You're so lame!

212
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:17,791
Uh, why do you sound so upset?

213
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:19,541
Since you're so
completely obsessed

214
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:21,125
with everything that girl does,

215
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:23,833
you should know she's meeting
some rando outside the station.

216
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:25,416
[YUZU]
Huh?

217
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,125
She's definitely enjoying
her Christmas right now.

218
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:30,291
What the heck are you
going on about, Matsuri?

219
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:32,166
I don't think that
joke is very funny.

220
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,833
But it's not a joke.

221
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:35,958
You remember my
work phone, right?

222
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:39,208
I've graciously let Mei
borrow it for the day.

223
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:40,750
Wanna call it?

224
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:43,875
If you call right now, you
might even get through to her.

225
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:47,000
[MATSURI]
Wake up, Yuzu.

226
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:48,541
She's not the perfect
goody-two-shoes

227
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:50,250
you think she is.

228
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:53,750
Can't you see she's
nothing but a skank?

229
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,583
It's not only that,
but she lied to you

230
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:57,875
about where she
was gonna be today.

231
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:00,208
Come on, you deserve
better than that,

232
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:01,916
so why don't you give up on her?

233
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,291
Who needs a liar when
you've got me, anyway?

234
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:09,250
Just forget about her already.

235
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:13,791
[YUZU]
So, when Mei... when she said...

236
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:17,208
That girl needs you, so you
shouldn't let her down.

237
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:19,291
[MATSURI]
Hm?

238
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:21,833
[YUZU]
Let's go. We need to apologize.

239
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:24,166
Huh? To who?

240
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:29,375
To the only person who has been
thinking of your feelings!

241
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:31,250
I wasn't even going
to do this today,

242
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:34,291
but Mei insisted that I should
pay more attention to you.

243
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:37,583
She cares about you, Matsuri.

244
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:38,833
[gasps]

245
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:39,458
We should hurry.

246
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:41,166
Seriously?

247
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,083
Are you telling me I played
right into her hands

248
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:45,000
in spite of all that planning?

249
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:47,750
I'm not the loser
here, she is!

250
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:50,291
She's just a boring,
stupid robot!

251
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:53,041
How can she win out over me? Uh?

252
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:59,458
[YUZU] You've got a lot to
learn about relationships.

253
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:01,166
It's not some kind of game.

254
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:04,333
Stop boiling it down
to winning and losing!

255
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:31,916
[YUZU] Please pick up.
Please pick up.

256
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,416
[gasps]

257
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,000
Mei, thank goodness!
Are you all right?

258
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:38,708
[busy tone]

259
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:45,750
[MEI]
Yuzu?

260
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:47,000
[gasps]

261
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:55,291
I think I hung up on you.

262
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:56,875
Sorry, I wasn't
trying to be rude.

263
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:59,541
I just don't know how
to use this phone.

264
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:04,291
[YUZU]
Oh, Mei!

265
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,541
[YUZU]
I was so worried!

266
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:16,833
[YUZU]
Mei.

267
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:23,750
[MEI] So? Did the two of
you have a fun Christmas?

268
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:27,083
Shut up. Don't need
to rub it in.

269
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:29,333
You know it's
game over for me.

270
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:32,708
I'm sure Yuzu hates my guts
now that she knows what I did.

271
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:33,958
Looks like you've
stolen my spot

272
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:38,083
as her little sister
once and for all.

273
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:39,625
I should've known.

274
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,458
I was stupid to think there
was someone out there

275
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:44,000
who'd love me and nobody else.

276
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:48,708
You know something?
We're kind of alike.

277
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:52,791
I was always so desperate to
be loved, just like you are.

278
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:54,458
But I kept my heart
locked up tight,

279
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:57,541
and pushed everyone away
when they tried to get close.

280
00:16:57,625 --> 00:17:02,125
Before I knew it,
I was left feeling empty.

281
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:03,958
Empty, huh?

282
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:08,000
[MEI] Yes, but there are certain
pushy people in this world

283
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:11,375
who will love you no matter
how much you protest.

284
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:15,500
And if we're lucky enough
to meet one of them,

285
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:18,041
then even we can end up happy.

286
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:21,291
Well, you might've
defeated me this time.

287
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:22,708
I mean, taught me a lesson...

288
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,541
But what you did
was really dumb.

289
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:26,250
What if that old pervert
at the train station

290
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:28,875
didn't wanna take
no for an answer?

291
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:29,791
[sighs]

292
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:31,083
I considered that,

293
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:33,708
and I was prepared for
that outcome as well.

294
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:35,041
What?

295
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:36,541
But you would've had to
do it with some gross dude

296
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:37,583
you don't even know!

297
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:40,666
As I told you,
we're quite similar.

298
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:45,583
I think I was testing Yuzu's
reaction... the way you would.

299
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,875
[MATSURI]
Take it from me, Mei.

300
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:53,750
You could stand to be
a lot more direct.

301
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:59,083
[YUZU] I still think
you should stay over.

302
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:00,458
[MATSURI]
Nah, it's too short-notice.

303
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:02,416
My parents would flip out.

304
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,208
All right.

305
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:05,708
Oh, yeah.

306
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:07,958
I almost forgot, I wanted to
give you a Christmas present

307
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:09,958
for all the trouble
I caused you today.

308
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:12,458
Why don't you come
a little closer?

309
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:14,208
What is it?

310
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:15,666
[MATSURI]
I know Mei plays it cool

311
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:21,083
and pretends like
she doesn't care...

312
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:24,375
...but underneath it all,
she really likes you.

313
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:29,416
Whoa! I mean as a sister!
Don't be weird.

314
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,583
Oh my God, I wish you could
see your face right now!

315
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:34,375
[YUZU]
Matsuri!

316
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:38,500
[MATSURI] Anyway, thanks
for playing with me today.

317
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:41,000
You're both good big sisters.

318
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:45,541
[MATSURI] Have a nice
night together, ladies!

319
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:48,666
Ooh! Next time, let's
have a threesome, yeah?

320
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:49,958
Bye!

321
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,791
A what?

322
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:57,333
[YUZU]
Matsuri!

323
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:08,125
[YUZU sighs]

324
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:10,166
Gee, I don't think I've
ever been this exhausted

325
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,875
on Christmas before.

326
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:14,333
I'm pretty sure Mom's
already gone to bed.

327
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:16,750
She said she had to work early.

328
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:25,875
Wait, there's one more thing.

329
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:27,125
[YUZU]
Hm?

330
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:34,000
[YUZU] It's not healthy
to eat this late.

331
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:36,083
Just wait till tomorrow.

332
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:38,541
But you specifically
made this cake for today.

333
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:40,500
And besides, if I save
it for tomorrow,

334
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:42,500
then it won't be as fresh.

335
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:45,166
[YUZU] You're the most stubborn
girl I've ever met, Mei.

336
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,958
Honestly, you're a lot
like your grandpa.

337
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:50,791
I'm flattered.

338
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:57,750
Well? How is it?

339
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:01,250
[MEI]
Hmm...

340
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:02,416
Disgusting.

341
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:05,041
[whines]

342
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:07,250
Did you think I would say that?

343
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:08,625
[YUZU gasps]

344
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,791
Aw, c'mon, would it kill you
to be up-front with me?

345
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:14,791
This is who I am.

346
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:22,875
By the way...

347
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:26,791
What happened today
was totally my fault.

348
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:31,250
I'm stupid, and I'm a
terrible older sister.

349
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:34,500
I hurt you and Matsuri.

350
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:36,416
I'm sorry.

351
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:41,875
[MEI] I can't believe
what a crybaby you are.

352
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:46,916
Mei!

353
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,250
Just promise me one thing.

354
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:52,916
Please don't ever put yourself
in danger like that again, okay?

355
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,666
Because if you get hurt...

356
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,125
...then it's gonna
hurt me and our mom

357
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:59,000
a hundred thousand times more!

358
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:00,750
Remember that!

359
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:06,708
You have to come to me
when you have a problem, Mei.

360
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:15,291
[MEI]
All right.

361
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:16,458
If that's what you want,

362
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:19,208
then I'll try to be
a bit more direct.

363
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:25,750
Whoa. Hold on, Mei.

364
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:28,750
Not so fast. What are you doing?

365
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:31,916
[MEI]
Here.

366
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,875
I don't understand
what's happening.

367
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:36,958
My heart is about to
beat out of my chest.

368
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:38,833
Can you feel it?

369
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:43,416
[YUZU] Wow. Why is she saying
this all of a sudden?

370
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,791
[MEI]
Yuzu.

371
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:47,208
There are some things inside
me that would thrill you

372
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:49,125
and some that would
terrify you.

373
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:52,791
I need you to understand that
much from the very start.

374
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:58,458
If you really want to see...

375
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:00,458
...just say the word.

376
00:23:32,791 --> 00:23:34,083
[MEI]
I figured it was only fair

377
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:35,458
for me to give you
what you wanted.

378
00:23:35,541 --> 00:23:37,125
Look, if you like someone,

379
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:39,041
you have to consider
their feelings, Yuzu.

380
00:23:39,125 --> 00:23:42,125
[YUZU] Why did it have
to be Mei of all people?

381
00:23:42,208 --> 00:23:44,875
Tell me how you feel about
me. I want the truth, Yuzu.


382
00:23:44,958 --> 00:23:46,958
Um, how do I say it?
