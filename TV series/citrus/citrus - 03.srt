1
00:00:11,625 --> 00:00:13,708
[HARUMI]
Whoa, what happened?

2
00:00:13,791 --> 00:00:15,916
I'm right here for you
if you need to vent.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,541
Uh.

4
00:00:17,625 --> 00:00:21,333
It freaks me out when you get
all quiet on me like this, girl.

5
00:00:21,416 --> 00:00:25,333
I'm your friend, so whatever
you need, I've got you!

6
00:00:25,416 --> 00:00:26,500
Thanks, Harumin.

7
00:00:26,583 --> 00:00:29,041
It's nice to know that
you have my back.

8
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:33,583
Either way, I gotta solve
this one on my own.

9
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:38,375
All right, now I'm
super confused,

10
00:00:38,458 --> 00:00:40,583
but that doesn't matter.

11
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:42,666
Not as long as you feel better!

12
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:03,041
[YUZU]
So this is what love feels like.

13
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:45,375
[YUZU] Who cares about
status and reputation?


14
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:52,291
[YUZU] None of those
things matter to me.

15
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:57,500
[YUZU] It's more important
to be true to my feelings.

16
00:02:57,583 --> 00:02:59,458
I'm done running away!

17
00:03:02,958 --> 00:03:04,791
All right, we need to talk!

18
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:09,833
[CHAIRMAN grunting]

19
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:23,416
Grandfather!

20
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,833
[NURSE A]
Shh.

21
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:29,333
He's sleeping.
Let's not wake him.

22
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:33,291
[NURSE A]
Oh, I meant to tell you.

23
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:35,416
A darling blonde girl
about your age

24
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,291
brought him in here
earlier today.

25
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:39,916
She was a big help,
whoever she was.

26
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,416
Stayed right by his side until
everything settled on down.

27
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,125
Then she refused to go anywhere

28
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:47,750
until we promised to
contact his granddaughter.

29
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:50,041
He's very lucky that
girl was around.

30
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:52,291
Such a sweetheart.

31
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:01,916
Aw, man, it's late.

32
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:05,708
I'm back, Gramps.

33
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:09,791
Uh. I didn't know you
were here. I'll go.

34
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:10,833
[MEI]
Wait.

35
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:22,166
[YUZU] It's so hard to
look her in the eye.

36
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:25,416
But just standing here is weird.

37
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,625
What if our eyes meet

38
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:29,916
and I get so nervous
I say something stupid?

39
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
No, I have to.

40
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:35,041
I promised myself
I wouldn't run.

41
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:36,416
Hey, about earlier--

42
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,333
[MEI]
Mei.

43
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:43,416
Just call me "Mei."
It is my name.

44
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,583
You told the nurse to
call his granddaughter,

45
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:49,416
but you didn't give her a
specific name to contact.

46
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,666
I can only assume you haven't
been using my name

47
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,208
because you can't
remember what it is.

48
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:55,875
No, I...

49
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:06,666
[YUZU] I was just too shy
to say it... after that.

50
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,291
[MEI] We may be sisters, but it
doesn't feel like you're older

51
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:12,875
since we're in the same
grade, and you're... you.

52
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:14,500
Even so, I think
it's appropriate

53
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:16,625
to be on a first name basis.

54
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:21,541
Especially... since
we're a family.

55
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:29,500
[YUZU]
What'd she just say?

56
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:32,125
Come on. It's clear you
wanted me to touch you.

57
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,250
Listen, you.

58
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:35,583
[YUZU]
Now that I think about it,

59
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:39,583
she's never said my name either.

60
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:42,125
But maybe now...

61
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:44,208
Anyway, would you
please tell Mother

62
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:46,125
that there's no need to worry?

63
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:48,583
[YUZU]
She's trying to move forward!

64
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:50,833
Sounds good!

65
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:52,208
Well, I better head home.

66
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:55,000
Let's do this whole talking
thing again tomorrow!

67
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:57,500
Have a good night, Mei!

68
00:05:57,583 --> 00:06:00,166
[YUZU chuckles]

69
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:05,625
[YUZU]
Hey, Mom, what's up?

70
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:08,291
Yep, I'm on my way home now.

71
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:09,875
Uh-huh, that's the
way it sounded.

72
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:11,875
She even said we were a family.

73
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:15,416
Oh, and also she said
for you not to worry.

74
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:19,375
Yeah! It's starting to feel
like we're officially sisters!

75
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:24,583
[UME]
You there? Yuzu?

76
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:30,583
[YUZU]
Sisters.

77
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:41,666
[YUZU]
Hey! Over here!

78
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,375
[chuckles]

79
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:47,875
How's it goin', Mei?

80
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:50,541
[YUZU]
I've said her name twice now!

81
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:51,583
[MEI]
I'm going in.

82
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:54,000
Oh! Okay then, uh.

83
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:58,458
So... look, I know it might
not be the best time

84
00:06:58,541 --> 00:07:00,416
to bring this up, but still.

85
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,416
There's something
I need to say.

86
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:06,666
[CHAIRMAN]
Ah, about your expulsion.

87
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:10,833
Before we get to that,
I'd like to express my thanks.

88
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:13,833
I apologize for troubling
you yesterday.

89
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:16,125
[YUZU] Don't sweat it!
That wasn't a big deal at all.

90
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:19,458
Anyone would've
done the same thing.

91
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:21,750
And besides, you're my gramps.

92
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:25,458
Family sticks together.
Everybody knows that.

93
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:29,916
[CHAIRMAN] There's still
a great deal to discuss,

94
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,958
but I'm revoking your expulsion.

95
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:33,708
You may attend school.

96
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:35,125
[YUZU gasps]

97
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:37,833
[CHAIRMAN] Mei spoke with
me about it the other day.

98
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:41,333
I was being too prideful
in so many ways.

99
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:44,208
As chairman and grandfather.

100
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:46,625
This hospitalization
has given me a chance

101
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:49,416
to reflect on my shortcomings.

102
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,333
[YUZU]
Wow, that's awesome.

103
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:53,625
She talked to him for me!

104
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:58,750
As for you, Mei, I want you
to make your own decisions.

105
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:01,166
You have to choose how
to live your life.

106
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,458
[MEI gasps]

107
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:04,250
But, Grandfather!

108
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:06,166
Am I clear?

109
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:10,833
Yes.

110
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:15,875
[YUZU]
Thanks for your help, Mei.

111
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:17,416
[MEI]
It was nothing.

112
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,666
[YUZU] So, um, you
should come back home!

113
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,625
What did Gramps tell you?
Do what makes you happy!

114
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:26,833
[YUZU]
I bet Mom would be so glad!

115
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:28,416
Come on. Please?

116
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:32,833
[MEI] With or without Father,
Mother's house is still my home.

117
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:36,083
I'd go back no matter
what you said.

118
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:37,458
[chuckles]

119
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:42,791
[YUZU]
And just like that,

120
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:46,250
I returned to my normal
everyday life at the academy.

121
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:49,625
Hey, girl! Oh!

122
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:51,916
I missed you!

123
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,875
Get off me, Harumin!
I can't breathe!

124
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:56,916
I was scared you were
expelled forever!

125
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,625
[YUZU gasps]

126
00:08:57,708 --> 00:08:58,833
Jeez, keep it down.

127
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:00,791
I don't want the whole
world to know that!

128
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:06,291
I apologize if I
upset you, Mother.

129
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:07,500
[UME]
Mei!

130
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:10,708
Welcome home, dear.

131
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:15,708
[YUZU] I don't care if
she didn't come back

132
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:18,000
because of anything I said.

133
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:20,708
I'm just really
happy she's here.

134
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:42,583
What are you doing?

135
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:43,708
[YUZU]
Hm?

136
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:47,916
Your bear just needed
a little surgery.

137
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:51,583
Please don't touch
my belongings.

138
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:55,500
He looks rough.
Did you sew this up?

139
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:56,625
Maybe.

140
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:59,458
[YUZU]
I thought you'd be more, like...

141
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:00,500
What?

142
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:04,875
Oh, uh. Y'see...
So what's his name?

143
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:06,041
[MEI]
Name?

144
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:08,416
[YUZU]
Yeah, what do you call him?

145
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:12,125
[YUZU]
"Hello there, Mei!

146
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:16,041
It's me, your good
pal Ansoniko!

147
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:21,625
Ansoniko loves you...
so very much!"

148
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:22,791
Here!

149
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,833
Okay, Ansoniko.

150
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:40,625
[HARUMI]
And my grandma was like--

151
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:41,666
[MEI]
You two.

152
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:42,708
[BOTH]
Hm?

153
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:44,083
[YUZU]
Oh! Mei!

154
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:46,250
[MEI] Why are you wandering
around in the hallway?

155
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:48,083
You should be in the classroom.

156
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:50,208
Really? Come on!

157
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:51,958
On our way!

158
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:58,333
Rude!

159
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:00,583
[YUZU] I still don't understand
why she's never called me

160
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:02,500
by my first name.

161
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:22,208
That's weird. Do big sisters
not get called by their name?

162
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:23,625
Huh? What'd you just say?

163
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:27,041
Uh, it's not important.

164
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:31,583
Harumin, I wanna get
closer to my sister.

165
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:35,208
Any ideas on what I should do?

166
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:37,833
You're trying to bond
with the ice queen?

167
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:41,583
Man, I wish I knew. Good luck.

168
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:43,833
Oh, is that why you've
been reading this thing?

169
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:45,750
[YUZU]
Don't judge me!

170
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:47,291
I know it's gonna take time,

171
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:50,166
but we should do our best to
get along, at the very least.

172
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,958
It's tough 'cause we have
totally different lives, y'know?

173
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:54,583
And we're polar opposites.

174
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:58,000
She just doesn't
get me like at all.

175
00:11:58,083 --> 00:11:59,750
[YUZU]
Now that I think about it,

176
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:03,166
I don't really know all
that much about Mei.

177
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:04,583
What are you doing, perv?

178
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:08,958
So crazy! I never knew a
person could bend that way.

179
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:11,791
Hey! This is not what
I meant by getting closer!

180
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:13,333
[HARUMI]
Jeez, stop screaming!

181
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:17,000
It's not like I was actually
gonna do anything! Chill!

182
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:20,208
[YUZU]
Sorry I'm late!

183
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:22,833
[MEI] You're supposed
to come straight home.

184
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:24,166
Where were you?

185
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:27,666
[YUZU] Yeah. I was just
doing some research.

186
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:30,333
[UME] I wish you would've
come home sooner, Yuzu.

187
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,041
We really could've used your
help setting it up, you know.

188
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:35,625
Huh? What's "it"?

189
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:39,166
See? A double bed!

190
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,833
You always wanted a
nice big bed, right?

191
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:44,916
Plus, now you get
to have more space!

192
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,791
And since Mei's back, it's
like a welcome home present!

193
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:52,666
Isn't it great? Aw,
look you're speechless!

194
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:53,708
Sure is!

195
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:55,375
I'm gonna go grab a shower!

196
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:58,958
What? But dinner's almost
ready, dear. Wait till later.

197
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,208
[YUZU gasps]

198
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:14,791
[UME]
Yuzu, don't make a mess!

199
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:18,708
[YUZU]
Oh, no.

200
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:22,250
This is bad.

201
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:24,541
This is really bad!

202
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:33,416
[YUZU] Of course, bedtime was
here before I knew it.

203
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,666
I don't get how,

204
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:37,708
but Mei is surprisingly
calm about all of this.

205
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:41,666
[YUZU]
She's already asleep.

206
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:46,833
[YUZU]
Meanwhile, my heart feels like

207
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:49,875
it's gonna beat out of my chest.

208
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:52,250
I hope she can't hear it.

209
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:59,125
[YUZU]
I can feel her body heat.

210
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:02,875
So close.

211
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:07,000
Her skin.

212
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:08,708
Her hair.

213
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:14,750
[YUZU]
I want to touch her.

214
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:17,833
What?

215
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:19,083
[YUZU gasps]

216
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:21,333
Uh. I was just, uh...

217
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:25,041
Well...

218
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:28,916
[YUZU]
What the heck is wrong me?

219
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:34,500
[YUZU]
Mei?

220
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:38,208
I can't sleep. Especially
not under the same covers.

221
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:41,875
It's far too warm for that.
Much warmer than usual.

222
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:46,125
Oh. Yeah, I suppose it is
a little warm tonight.

223
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:48,666
Are you gonna go sleep
by yourself then?

224
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,041
[MEI]
Yes.

225
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:51,458
I can't get a good night's sleep

226
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:54,541
with the way you've been
tossing and turning all night.

227
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:00,375
Mei, tell me...

228
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:04,125
Why don't you call me
by my first name?

229
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:07,500
Is it because I'm older?
Does that make it weird?

230
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:08,333
If that's all--

231
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:11,250
[MEI]
Don't be absurd.

232
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:12,833
We use our names
around other people

233
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:15,333
because it's expected of us.

234
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:19,875
Our parents getting married
doesn't make us close.

235
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:23,875
We're sisters, but I have
no interest in you.

236
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:31,833
[YUZU] If that's true,
then why did you kiss me?

237
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:35,458
[YUZU] You can't go around
kissing people without a reason.

238
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:38,000
That's just not
normal, you know!

239
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:42,125
Well, you kept
running your mouth.

240
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:51,916
[gasps]

241
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:04,583
[MEI] And obviously, this was
the easiest way to shut you up.

242
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:07,500
You see?

243
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:13,416
I see... that you're terrible.

244
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:17,791
It would seem so.

245
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:25,333
Sweet dreams.

246
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:37,083
Stupid jerk.

247
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:44,166
[HARUMI] We make one
stop on the way home

248
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,625
and they force us to
clean the bathroom?

249
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:48,250
Now that you're living
with the prez,

250
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:50,458
we can't get away with anything.

251
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:53,875
I know, right? I'm really
sorry about this.

252
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:56,875
Don't even worry about it.
I'm just kiddin' around.

253
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:58,708
[YUZU groans]

254
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:03,416
[MEI] We're sisters,
but I have no interest in you.

255
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:08,375
And obviously, this was the
easiest way to shut you up.

256
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:10,166
It would seem so.

257
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:14,166
She's so mean! All
while looking sad, too!

258
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:17,000
It's not fair, Mei!
Don't you know this hurts me?

259
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:20,541
Be careful, Yuzucchi!
You're just making it dirtier!

260
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:26,291
[HARUMI]
Aw, it's okay.

261
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:29,291
[YUZU] This'd be way
easier if I hated her.

262
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,583
[HIMEKO]
Unbelievable!

263
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:37,250
How many of these slackers

264
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:40,291
didn't take their
textbooks home?

265
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:42,416
[MARUTA]
Vice President, look!

266
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:46,416
Disgusting.

267
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:50,166
The student body keeps
getting more and more sloppy!

268
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,416
I bet I know the reason.

269
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:58,083
It's all because of this
stupid rebellious bimbo!

270
00:17:58,166 --> 00:17:59,916
[MEI]
That's enough for today.

271
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,416
What?

272
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,750
I can handle the rest of this.
You two should go on home.

273
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:07,791
President!

274
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:10,833
If that's really what
you'd prefer us to do.

275
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:17,250
[HIMEKO]
I hate that delinquent.

276
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:19,166
[MARUTA]
You mean Yuzu Aihara?

277
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:22,875
[HIMEKO] We have to address
her nasty behavior.

278
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:26,000
She shouldn't be allowed
to do whatever she wants.

279
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,666
I'm so beat!

280
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:51,625
You sure taught that
floor a lesson, though.

281
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:05,208
[HARUMI sighs]

282
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:06,583
Wanna go get ice cream?

283
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:08,708
We should totally stop
on the way home.

284
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:11,666
You are seriously hopeless.

285
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,250
[HARUMI] Well, I worked up a
sweat cleaning the bathroom.

286
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:17,375
If I don't go cool off,
I'll drop dead.

287
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:19,500
Even President Hardass
can overlook something

288
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:21,208
that small, can't she?

289
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:23,125
[YUZU]
Sorry, Harumin.

290
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:26,500
Uh, I forgot that I have plans,
but we can text later!

291
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:31,333
[YUZU] I can't believe
this is happening!

292
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:33,791
Mei's asking to see me!

293
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:39,541
Hey, slow down!
No running in the halls!

294
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:43,375
That was her.

295
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:51,250
Uh, hey!

296
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:53,958
It's polite to knock first.

297
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:58,583
Uh, sorry. And I'm sorry
about yesterday too!

298
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:01,916
I shouldn't have let my
temper get the best of me.

299
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,041
[MEI] I didn't call you here
to make you apologize.

300
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,083
So...?

301
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:11,875
[MEI] This book, it was found
amongst your belongings.

302
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:18,166
[YUZU]
The manga I bought yesterday!

303
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,833
I thought it was in my bag.

304
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:22,541
I don't know why you'd
want to read this smut,

305
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:26,541
but I can only imagine what
our mother would think.

306
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:30,583
It seems troubling,
seeing as we are sisters.

307
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:33,041
Luckily, I'm the only
one who's seen it.

308
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:36,666
That said, I don't want to be
the subject of any rumors.

309
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,666
Please dispose of it before--

310
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:58,166
[MEI]
What do you think you're doing?

311
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,333
Stop! We're at school!

312
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:08,458
This is all your fault, Mei!
You had to go and kiss me!

313
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:11,666
I-I'm confused!
I don't get this!

314
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,625
[YUZU]
Since that kiss,

315
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:16,958
Mei is the only thing
I can ever think about.

316
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:22,625
[YUZU]
There's no going back now.

317
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:27,166
I'm sorry I'm such a bad sister.

318
00:23:32,291 --> 00:23:34,125
Look, I've been the
president's closest friend

319
00:23:34,208 --> 00:23:35,708
ever since we
were both children.

320
00:23:35,791 --> 00:23:38,458
[YUZU]
I'm just adding to Mei's pain.

321
00:23:38,541 --> 00:23:39,625
[HIMEKO]
From day one,

322
00:23:39,708 --> 00:23:42,166
I've watched over her
and protected her.

323
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:44,750
You're acting strange.
What's the matter?


324
00:23:44,833 --> 00:23:46,833
[HIMEKO]
I want you to look at me.
