1
00:00:09,208 --> 00:00:10,333
[YUZU whining]

2
00:00:10,416 --> 00:00:11,708
[HARUMI]
Hm?

3
00:00:11,791 --> 00:00:17,750
[YUZU whining]

4
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:20,125
[YUZU]
Why did I do that?

5
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:33,500
[YUZU]
Ugh.

6
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:35,250
As much as I wish I
could take it back,

7
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:37,708
it's already been done.

8
00:00:37,791 --> 00:00:39,750
This is all your fault, Mei!

9
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:42,791
You had to go and kiss me!

10
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:46,250
I'm sorry I'm such a bad sister.

11
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:47,750
[YUZU]
Kill me!

12
00:00:47,833 --> 00:00:49,875
I can't believe I just went
and blurted out my feelings!

13
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:51,333
Man, she must think I'm
like a total creeper!

14
00:00:51,416 --> 00:00:54,958
[HARUMI] Yikes, are you gonna
be okay there, Yuzucchi?

15
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:58,750
"I'm sorry I'm a bad sister"?

16
00:00:58,833 --> 00:01:00,250
What did that mean?!

17
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:01,250
Uh, well--

18
00:01:01,333 --> 00:01:02,625
Listen!

19
00:01:02,708 --> 00:01:06,000
Let me stay over at your
place tonight! Please!

20
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:07,916
[HARUMI]
Hey, it's no problem.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,500
I'll let Grandma know.

22
00:01:09,583 --> 00:01:13,041
But just make sure to tell
your mom where you are.

23
00:01:13,125 --> 00:01:14,916
Thanks, Harumin.

24
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:54,041
[YUZU]
Jeez.

25
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:55,791
I wonder if we'll be
able to act normal

26
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:58,166
with each other after this.

27
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,625
Oh, Mei! You're here!

28
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:05,625
Yuzu just messaged
to say she's staying

29
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:07,166
at a friend's house tonight?

30
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,541
Didn't give me much notice.

31
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,666
[groans]

32
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:52,750
[YUZU]
This sucks!

33
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,250
I've been so hung
up on Mei lately,

34
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:57,041
I can't do anything else!

35
00:03:57,125 --> 00:04:00,083
So are you gonna, like, tell
me what's bothering you or not?

36
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:02,458
[YUZU]
Nah, it's no big deal.

37
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:05,958
I'm sorry to ask you this, but
can I sleep over tonight too?

38
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:07,291
[HARUMI]
Sure!

39
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,750
Hooray. The VP.

40
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:13,666
[HIMEKO]
Yuzu Aihara!

41
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:14,333
[YUZU gasps]

42
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:15,833
Now what?

43
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:18,750
[HARUMI]
Uh-oh, what'd you do this time?

44
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:21,541
I'm sorry, Harumin,
but I gotta go!

45
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:24,125
[HIMEKO]
Ah!

46
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:26,166
Not so fast, punk!

47
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,583
See ya?

48
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,791
[HIMEKO]
Don't you run from me!

49
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:35,958
I will catch you!

50
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:37,666
[YUZU] Hate to do this
to ya, short stuff,

51
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:38,875
but I really can't be on

52
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:41,291
the student council's
radar right now!

53
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:43,291
I can hear Mei's voice already.

54
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:45,458
I never want to see you again.

55
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:47,833
[YUZU]
Not gonna let that happen!

56
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,750
[HIMEKO]
I saw you yesterday!

57
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:55,250
When you were running
in the hall,

58
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:57,958
it was because you were meeting
with the president right?

59
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,208
Didn't I tell you I was
gonna catch you?

60
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:10,416
Now tell me, what exactly
were you doing with her?

61
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,708
All right, I'll spill, but
let's discuss it tomorrow

62
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:16,250
and literally anywhere but here!

63
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:23,666
[HARUMI] Shouldn't you go
home and get your stuff?

64
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:27,083
Sorry. I'm really
putting you out, huh?

65
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:28,625
It's cool.

66
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:31,083
Besides, having you around makes
everything more interesting.

67
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:33,791
Grandma and I get
bored sometimes.

68
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:52,375
Hello there, Madame.

69
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:03,583
[YUZU]
Wow, this place is swanky.

70
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:04,958
[HIMEKO]
Over here, Aihara.

71
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:06,166
[YUZU]
Hm?

72
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,750
Whoa!

73
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:12,208
Honestly, it's a shame I have to
waste my precious leisure time

74
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:14,500
on a lowlife like you.

75
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:20,250
Ice cream and a Marco Polo.

76
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:22,583
Just a moment please, Miss.

77
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:26,333
So, here's the thing,
Vice President.

78
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:28,666
[HIMEKO]
Himeko Momokino.

79
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,375
Okay, Miss Momokino.

80
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:33,958
Anyway, was there something
you wanted to talk about?

81
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:36,625
Oh, please, you know
precisely why we're meeting.

82
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:38,125
I'll ask again.

83
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:41,291
What happened between you two
in the chairman's office?

84
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:44,041
[YUZU]
Guess she's not gonna drop it.

85
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:48,125
Why is she asking, and how
much does she already know?

86
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:52,833
[YUZU] Uh, listen, I'm not
trying to like avoid you,

87
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:55,833
but wouldn't it be better
to ask Mei this question?

88
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,041
Ask Mei?

89
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,916
Yeah, you're on the
student council, so...

90
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,791
[HIMEKO] You and the president
are on a first-name basis?

91
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:05,708
Just what is the nature of
your relationship with her?!

92
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:09,083
Relationship's kind of a strong
word, don't you think?

93
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:10,208
She's my classmate?

94
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:11,416
Don't play dumb with me!

95
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,000
Our home rooms are right
next to each other!

96
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:14,958
Of course I know you
two are classmates!

97
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:16,291
Wait a second.

98
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:18,458
Why don't you tell me
what you are to Mei then?

99
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:20,208
I've been the president's
closest friend

100
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:21,750
since we were children!

101
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:23,458
We're practically inseparable!

102
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:25,958
Oh, I had no idea.

103
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:27,708
She and I have actually
known each other

104
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:30,208
for more than a decade now.

105
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:32,000
For as long as
we've been friends,

106
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:35,708
I've always watched over the
president and protected her.

107
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:42,458
Mei-Mei! It's good to see you!

108
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:43,458
[MEI]
Hm?

109
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:46,916
Oh! Hello, Himeko!
Good to see you!

110
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:53,625
[HIMEKO] Hey, Mei-Mei, is your
father gonna participate

111
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:57,250
in Parent's Day with
all the other families?

112
00:07:57,333 --> 00:08:02,083
He can't. The professor is
awfully busy with his work.

113
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:04,791
Well, I don't think you
need to be sad about it.

114
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:08,541
Even if he can't come,
I'll still be here with you.

115
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:11,583
[MEI] It's hard to walk
with your arm like that.

116
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,208
Aw, but, Mei-Mei.

117
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:18,750
[MEI giggles]

118
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:21,333
Thank you so much, Himeko.

119
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:34,125
[HIMEKO] Anyway, why do you
call your father "professor"?

120
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:36,125
It's kind of weird.

121
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:37,375
No, it's not.

122
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:38,833
It makes sense to call him that

123
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:41,000
because he's taught
me so many things.

124
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:45,125
I want to learn more, all there
is to know about my family,

125
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:47,500
so one day I can help him.

126
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:48,875
Wow, Mei-Mei.

127
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:50,916
You seem to have a lot of
respect for your father.

128
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,750
That's wonderful!

129
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:01,958
[WAITER A]
Enjoy your tea.

130
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,416
[HIMEKO] However, we soon
came to a turning point.

131
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,000
After that, the president
started to become more distant,

132
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:12,083
and kept everything to herself.

133
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:13,750
Seeing as I'm her
best confidante,

134
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:17,583
you can imagine how worried
I've been about her.

135
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:20,750
What was the big turning point?

136
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:26,875
It happened on the day
her father chose to leave.

137
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:31,291
Father. Stay.

138
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:32,791
[YUZU]
Huh.

139
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:36,208
I wonder what happened
between Mei and her dad.

140
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:38,583
Anyway, now you understand
why it's imperative

141
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:41,208
that I watch over
her so closely.

142
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:45,083
Now, what did you two do
in the chairman's office?

143
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,916
[YUZU]
Um.

144
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,750
What do you think of the way
Mei's been acting recently?

145
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:53,166
Answer my question first!

146
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,541
[HIMEKO]
She looks completely devastated.

147
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:05,333
In fact, I haven't
seen her this upset

148
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:08,166
since the day her
father abandoned her.

149
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,416
[YUZU]
I'm just adding to Mei's pain.

150
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,625
What gives me the right

151
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:14,958
to force my feelings
onto her like this?

152
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:17,708
I have no idea what
she's been through!

153
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:19,958
[HIMEKO]
Get it through your skull.

154
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:21,875
Why would she want
anything to do with you

155
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:24,083
when all you can offer
her is suffering?

156
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:27,291
You should do us all a favor
and get out of her life.

157
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:33,208
[YUZU]
That's enough.

158
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:37,083
You can't just leave!

159
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:45,750
[YUZU]
Tell me something I don't know.

160
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:49,541
[HIMEKO]
Get back here!

161
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:51,875
You still owe me an explanation!

162
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:54,583
[YUZU]
I can't be around her anyway.

163
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:10,000
[HIMEKO]
President!

164
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:14,541
[HIMEKO] It's good to see you!
What a pleasant surprise!

165
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:17,875
Yuzu Aihara requested
a meeting with me today.

166
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:19,125
And don't worry,

167
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:21,250
I made sure to give her
a very stern lecture.

168
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:23,625
[MEI]
When are you coming home?

169
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:25,083
[YUZU]
I can't.

170
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:26,500
And why is that?

171
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:29,083
You live there, right, Yuzu?

172
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:30,541
[gasps]

173
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,916
[YUZU] Well, yeah, but
it's also where you live.

174
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,083
Will one of you please tell
me the meaning of this?

175
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:40,583
What's going on?

176
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:43,416
Sorry, Himeko. I'd planned to
tell you about it earlier.

177
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,041
She and I, well, we're sisters.

178
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:47,625
[gasps]

179
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,416
[MEI]
I should go.

180
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,375
Right behind you!

181
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:56,458
Oh, yeah! Momokino!

182
00:11:57,875 --> 00:12:00,125
Thanks for meeting up with me!

183
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:28,916
[YUZU] Doesn't look like
that made her mad.

184
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,250
As usual, she's a
woman of few words.

185
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:36,250
But right now, maybe that's
not such a bad thing.

186
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:48,250
[sighs]

187
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:50,541
[YUZU]
There's no place like home!

188
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:52,083
[chuckles]

189
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:55,666
It was nice to have the bed to
myself for a while at least.

190
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:59,625
[YUZU] Right, she had the whole
thing to herself for a bit.

191
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:02,166
Wait, we're in bed together?

192
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:05,166
I thought she wanted
to sleep separately.

193
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,541
Something wrong?

194
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:08,541
Nope, not at all!

195
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:12,375
[YUZU] I should apologize
for what I did, but...

196
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:15,208
She's completely devastated.

197
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:18,250
[YUZU] What if I end up
hurting her again?

198
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:19,333
[MEI]
Yuzu.

199
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:20,833
Uh, I'm up!

200
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:23,875
About what happened at
school the other day.

201
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:29,000
[YUZU] Yeah, I wanted to
talk to you about that.

202
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:31,666
[MEI] If you're planning
to apologize, don't.

203
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,541
Because I think I may have
pressured you into it as well.

204
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:36,958
I hear you, Mei, but
I do need to apologize.

205
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:38,000
I shouldn't have done anything

206
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:39,875
without considering
how you felt.

207
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:41,541
So...

208
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:47,416
You won't let this go until
you get some kind of closure.

209
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,125
I understand that.

210
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:50,583
[gasps]

211
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:54,041
[YUZU]
Yeah, that's one way to put it.

212
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:57,958
Maybe if we, um... I don't know.

213
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:18,250
[MEI]
Good night.

214
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:20,916
[YUZU gasping]

215
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,333
And please be quiet.

216
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:28,791
[UME]
Yuzu! You're up early today.

217
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:32,125
[YUZU] Yeah, I wanted to
leave for school with Mei.

218
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:35,000
Gotta make sure
I have enough time

219
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,916
to put my makeup on, don't I?

220
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,958
[UME]
Uh.

221
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:41,916
[chuckles] Yup, that's my girl.

222
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,208
[YUZU] It's kinda cool to
be up and about this early.

223
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:50,875
For real. The scenery
is totally different.

224
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:57,166
Morning, Momokino.
How's it goin'?

225
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:59,291
[gasps]

226
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:00,833
What is she doing here?

227
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:04,666
The president always makes
her morning commute with me!

228
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:07,125
Are you sure it's acceptable
for the student council

229
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:09,333
to associate with
troublemakers like her?

230
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:12,458
It's not a huge issue. No one's
ever around at this hour.

231
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:15,458
That's not what I
meant, President!

232
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:16,708
Can I help you?

233
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:19,250
I just can't get over
the way your hair curls.

234
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:20,666
Is that really natural?

235
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:21,916
I told you, yes!

236
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,416
And speaking of appearances,

237
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,708
everything about you is an
affront to our dress code.

238
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,708
Oh, I almost forgot.

239
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:30,166
You were the one who brought
my bag back to me, right, Mei?

240
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:32,083
I never said thank you.

241
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:33,625
[MEI]
Don't thank me for that.

242
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:36,791
[YUZU] Aw, so modest.
Seriously, thanks.

243
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:38,666
[MEI] No, my point is
that you should try to be

244
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,250
a little more careful.

245
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:42,208
If I hadn't taken
your bag first,

246
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:45,000
it's possible someone else
would've picked it up.

247
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:48,875
You're free to read any manga
you like, but not on campus.

248
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:50,750
[coughing]

249
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:53,708
President, wait! What's
this about a manga?

250
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:55,208
[YUZU]
Uhh!

251
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:59,083
Nothing! It's a little
secret between us.

252
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,458
Right, Mei?

253
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:02,166
[MEI]
I suppose.

254
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,458
[YUZU]
Did you look inside of it?

255
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:07,625
[MEI]
I made sure it was yours.

256
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:13,500
[HIMEKO]
That's terrible, Mei-Mei!

257
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:16,583
How can he just leave his
poor daughter behind?

258
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:18,125
Don't worry about me, Himeko.

259
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:21,625
I was the one who decided
that it should be this way.

260
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:27,375
I have to guard this place,
so one day he'll return.

261
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:38,541
[HIMEKO] Okay. Until then,
I'm going to guard you.

262
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:43,000
I promise, Mei-Mei.
I'll never leave you!

263
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:45,333
[HIMEKO] Since that day, I've
done everything in my power

264
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:47,375
to keep my promise.

265
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:54,166
I'm not letting you
take her from me.

266
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:09,791
[HIMEKO]
After-school inspection's over.

267
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,125
[HIMEKO] All the students
have gone home.

268
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:19,458
Understood.

269
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:23,208
Hey, do you remember
back when we were younger?

270
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:26,833
I used to style your hair
for you all the time.

271
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:29,333
Yes. I remember that.

272
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:33,000
You have beautiful hair,
President. I've always loved it.

273
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:35,250
Long and straight and silky.

274
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:38,791
I'd trade my curls for hair
like yours in a heartbeat.

275
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:42,500
You're acting differently.
Something wrong?

276
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:48,125
[HIMEKO]
I'm the same as I always am.

277
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:49,833
[MEI]
Himeko!

278
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,291
Your ears are red.

279
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:56,250
That always has been a
dead giveaway with you.

280
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:58,208
[MEI] We shouldn't do
this here, Himeko.

281
00:17:58,291 --> 00:18:00,125
We're on school grounds!

282
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:01,708
We've been friends
for a long time,

283
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:04,375
there's no reason to be nervous.

284
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:07,791
No one knows you
as well as I do.

285
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:10,125
I want you to look at me.

286
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,250
[HIMEKO]
President.

287
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:16,041
No. My Mei-Mei.

288
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:35,583
She's late. Unusual.

289
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:37,458
[MEI]
I'm home.

290
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:40,333
[YUZU]
There you are! Welcome back!

291
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:43,208
Let's eat dinner. I made
us some omelets with rice.

292
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:46,625
Sorry, but I don't think I'm
in the mood to eat anything.

293
00:18:58,083 --> 00:18:59,458
[HIMEKO]
Aihara.

294
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:01,333
I'd like a word
with you, please.

295
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:03,583
Someone's popular with
the student council.

296
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:05,541
Maybe it's a love confession.

297
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:06,500
Yeah...

298
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:10,125
[chuckles nervously]

299
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:16,541
[YUZU]
This is getting old, Momokino.

300
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:19,083
Just forget about the
chairman's office.

301
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:21,875
[HIMEKO] That's not
why I called you here.

302
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:24,583
[YUZU] Really? So it
is a love confession?

303
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:26,541
I suppose, in a way.

304
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:28,916
Look, I appreciate
the offer, but--

305
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,500
I'm not confessing to you!

306
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:40,250
I was alone with the
President yesterday.

307
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:43,791
We did things we've
never done before.

308
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:49,041
Did things you've
never done before?

309
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:53,208
What is that supposed
to mean exactly?

310
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:56,791
Anyway, Mei didn't mention
any of that to me.

311
00:19:57,875 --> 00:19:58,708
Oh, right.

312
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:00,416
[HIMEKO]
Why would she tell you?

313
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,166
And I don't care if you
are head-over-heels

314
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:03,416
in love with her,

315
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,041
'cause Mei-Mei doesn't
see you as anything more

316
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:08,250
than her big sister,
and she never will.

317
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:10,125
Nobody said anything about love.

318
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:12,458
Where did that come
from all of a sudden?

319
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:15,125
[HIMEKO]
You mean you don't love her?

320
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:19,041
Then it appears I've
misunderstood the situation.

321
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:20,083
Excellent.

322
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:21,708
Well, I do have
something with her,

323
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:24,375
so we'd like your
complete support.

324
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:26,666
[YUZU]
No.

325
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:29,125
Bye, sis.

326
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:38,333
[YUZU]
That can't be true.

327
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:49,083
[YUZU]
I mean. She did kiss me, so...

328
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:51,916
Hey, can I talk to you?

329
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,291
You need something?

330
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,458
Earlier today, when Momokino
called me out of class,

331
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:58,916
she said some crazy stuff
that got me super confused.

332
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,666
So, I was wondering if you
could explain it to me.

333
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:05,833
Did something happen yesterday?

334
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:11,375
I don't see what that
has to do with you.

335
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:12,875
[gasps]

336
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:17,333
[YUZU]
Yeah. I guess you're right.

337
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:19,000
Sorry.

338
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:30,166
[YUZU] Things they've
never done before?

339
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:38,500
[YUZU] That could mean
all kinds of stuff.

340
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:43,541
I don't see what that
has to do with you.

341
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:46,708
[YUZU] Man, she sure
has a lot of secrets.

342
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:56,666
What is this weird feeling?

343
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:59,791
Is this what it's
like to be jealous?

344
00:23:32,416 --> 00:23:33,625
The president and I,

345
00:23:33,708 --> 00:23:35,708
we've done some things
you don't know about.

346
00:23:35,791 --> 00:23:36,916
[YUZU]
Sorry, Momokino,

347
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,625
but it looks like this
puts me in the lead.

348
00:23:39,708 --> 00:23:41,208
This is none of your
concern at all.

349
00:23:41,291 --> 00:23:44,041
[YUZU] What Mei needs right
now is not romance.


350
00:23:44,125 --> 00:23:47,000
If that happens, then all
of this will be worth it.
