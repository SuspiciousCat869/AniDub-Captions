1
00:01:43,791 --> 00:01:48,333
Uh, I dunno, Mei. This is
kind of out of nowhere.


2
00:01:48,416 --> 00:01:52,375
I need to show you my
gratitude for all you've done.


3
00:01:52,458 --> 00:01:57,000
Those complicated feelings I had
about my father and grandfather.

4
00:01:57,083 --> 00:02:01,083
You forced your way in and
helped me work through them.

5
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:04,750
So now, let's do
what you want to do.

6
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:07,000
I think I know what that is.

7
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:09,000
You mean...?

8
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:23,041
This'll make you happy, right?

9
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:24,416
[gasps]

10
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,708
Are you sure?

11
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:27,208
Yes.

12
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:56,125
[YUZU]
Sorry. I can't do this.

13
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:57,666
[gasps]

14
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:19,250
Have a good night.

15
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:50,541
[sighs]

16
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:52,500
[doorbell rings]

17
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:55,291
[YUZU]
Hello?

18
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:57,833
Meow!

19
00:03:57,916 --> 00:04:00,458
Oh, Matsuri.

20
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:01,333
[MATSURI]
Good morning!

21
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:03,583
I came to say Happy New Year.

22
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:05,958
See? I brought candy.

23
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:11,958
[YUZU] But Thousand-Year Candy's
for a totally different holiday.

24
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:14,500
Plus, it's the end of January.

25
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:20,250
So, uh, where's Mei?

26
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:22,791
I don't honestly know.

27
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:24,541
But she's probably
planning the school trip

28
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:26,250
with the student council.

29
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:27,958
[MATSURI]
Aww, man, I was hoping

30
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:31,166
I could talk President Brainiac
into helping me study today.

31
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,625
Next time.

32
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:34,708
Sorry, I guess you should've
asked her if she was free

33
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:36,916
before you came over.

34
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:47,416
So, how did your
Christmas go, Yuzu?

35
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,833
Did you and Mei bang?

36
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:51,291
I wanna hear about
all the dirty details!

37
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:54,458
What? Why do you think
we would we do that?

38
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,833
[MATSURI] Are you guys
fighting or something?

39
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:01,458
[sighs]

40
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:06,708
[MATSURI] Ya know, you can
be pretty immature at times.

41
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:07,791
[YUZU]
Huh?

42
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:09,041
[MATSURI]
We live in the real world,

43
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:10,875
so love doesn't always
work out the way it does

44
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:12,750
in fairy tales and silly manga.

45
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:13,875
[gasps]

46
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:17,208
Ooh. Well, well,
what have we here?

47
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:20,250
I think I just found
your secret stash!

48
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:21,833
Come to Mama!

49
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:23,500
[YUZU groans]

50
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,083
Here's the thing.

51
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:28,083
If you like someone, then you
have to consider their feelings.

52
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:31,750
Their feelings? Yeah.

53
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,666
That's a good point.

54
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,875
[MATSURI]
Hm?

55
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:38,208
[YUZU]
Nothing. Forget it.

56
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:43,208
There.

57
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,416
Have a good night, Mei.
Sweet dreams.

58
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:12,291
[SARA] Perfect! Looks like
everybody got here on time!

59
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:14,916
The station's really
packed today, too!

60
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,375
It's a wonder we
made it this far.

61
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:18,875
Thanks to you, we were almost
late getting over here.

62
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:20,833
I already told you, Sara.

63
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:22,875
Tokyo's just as good
as Kyoto to me

64
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:25,625
as long as I get to hang out
with my favorite big sister.

65
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:27,375
Not to me, it's not!

66
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:29,500
I've been looking forward
to going on a school trip

67
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:32,166
for like, forever,
and you know that!

68
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:34,208
[SARA sighs]

69
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:35,791
[SARA]
Anyway...

70
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:39,750
What a nice person.
I'm so glad we met!

71
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:42,041
Wow, that must've
meant a lot to you!

72
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:45,083
I never imagined I would run
into someone so kind and helpful

73
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:47,166
in a big city like Tokyo!

74
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:50,375
Today might be the luckiest
day of my entire life so far!

75
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:54,083
I mean, getting lost like that
had to have been destiny!

76
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:58,000
Jeez, there you go rambling
on about destiny again.

77
00:06:58,083 --> 00:06:59,791
[SARA]
Hey, Nina?

78
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:02,708
You bought that
Yuzubocchi, right?

79
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:05,208
Uhh... Nope. Guess I forgot.

80
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:06,583
[SARA gasps]

81
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:08,458
Didn't you tell me that was
a Tokyo-exclusive item

82
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:10,083
that you could only get today?

83
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:11,958
Yeah, but it's no biggie.

84
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:13,791
We don't have time to
go back and get it.

85
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:14,958
Come on, Nina!

86
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:18,208
It was your lucky color
and everything!

87
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:19,750
I'm okay.

88
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:23,750
Who cares what color it was?
You're all the good luck I need.

89
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:25,375
[SARA]
But you want one!

90
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:27,625
I'll go get it.
Stay right there!

91
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:29,583
[NINA]
Hey!

92
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:33,166
Don't worry. I'm not gonna
miss the train, 'kay?

93
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,291
[NINA sighs]

94
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:39,333
[NINA] That's my sister
for you. Oh, well.

95
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:40,500
[YUZU]
Crap.

96
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:43,166
Crap, crap, crap, crap,
crap, double crap!

97
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,416
"Crap" doesn't even
begin to describe it!

98
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,625
If I'm late for the school trip,
I'll be in huge trouble!

99
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:52,333
I'm on the way, Harumin!

100
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:54,625
[HARUMI] Where the heck
are you, Yuzucchi?

101
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:56,625
[YUZU]
Just now leaving my house!

102
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:58,208
Seriously?

103
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:00,208
[YUZU]
What about Mei?

104
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:03,416
I'm guessing she's already
there, right? Have you seen her?

105
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,541
[HARUMI]
Duh, like she'd be late.

106
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:09,166
Please, as we travel today,
remember that you ladies...

107
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,625
You better step on it,
they're about to call the roll!

108
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:12,958
[YUZU]
If I don't get there in time,

109
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:14,333
could you let Mei and
the teachers know

110
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:16,041
I'll catch up later?

111
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:19,166
[HARUMI] Sure, I'll tell them,
but they're not gonna like it.

112
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:26,708
Why'd I hafta oversleep today?

113
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:28,750
[YUZU] Jeez, Mei could've at
least said something to me

114
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:30,333
before she left!

115
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:46,833
[YUZU] Things have been weird
between us since Christmas.

116
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:54,208
[YUZU] Maybe she really
is done with me.

117
00:08:58,458 --> 00:08:59,791
[sighs]

118
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:06,833
[YUZU]
Missed it. Of course.

119
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:09,083
[BOY A] Mommy, can we please
get one of these cakes?

120
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:11,291
[YUZU]
Great, now I'm all sweaty.

121
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:12,833
[YUZUBOCCHI] The secret
ingredient is yuzu-fruit...

122
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:15,166
[YUZU]
Yuzubocchi!

123
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,416
Bye-bye!

124
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,000
That's crazy! This store
uses mascot characters?

125
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:20,708
[SARA chuckles]

126
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:22,875
[SARA]
They do today. See?

127
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:26,125
We're at a limited-time
Tokyo-exclusive pop-up event!

128
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:27,166
Cool!

129
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,958
Check out this
awesome phone strap.

130
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:30,833
You can only pick
them up in here!

131
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:32,708
Aw, it's adorable!

132
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:34,083
Yeah, I know, right?

133
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:35,791
I'm out on a school trip!

134
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:38,250
We're supposed to meet up
at the gate at ten o'clock!

135
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:39,375
[YUZU]
Huh?

136
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:42,125
I'm gonna head over
in a few minutes.

137
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:45,666
You do know it's 10:15 now.

138
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:50,458
[SARA]
Whew!

139
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:52,875
I can't believe we're heading
in the same direction!

140
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:55,125
Talk about a moment of destiny!

141
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:58,125
This way I won't get
lost on the way there!

142
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:03,291
You are such a generous
person, Miss Yuzu!

143
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:05,541
Thank goodness Yuzubocchi
brought us together!

144
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:07,708
Thanks, but you don't have
to call me "Miss Yuzu."

145
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:09,333
We're the same age, aren't we?

146
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:11,666
'Kay, then you can call me Sara.

147
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,375
It's nice to make a new friend.

148
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,041
I know things haven't quite
gone according to plan so far,

149
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:23,375
but today's turning
out to be great.

150
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:24,458
[YUZU]
Hm.

151
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,208
Did something else
bad happen to you?

152
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:28,708
My sis and I got
lost back in Tokyo.

153
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:30,041
It was scary!

154
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:32,166
But then we met the
most wonderful person!

155
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,708
Wait, you never told
me your sister

156
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:35,416
was supposed to
be with you, too!

157
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,666
[SARA]
Oh.

158
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,666
That's the part that got you?

159
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:42,791
Yeah, we're twins, but she's
technically the youngest one.

160
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,541
She's totally gorgeous
and is like,

161
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:47,291
way better in school than me.

162
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:49,291
She can be pretty
selfish sometimes,

163
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:51,916
but I guess she's a
decent enough sister.

164
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,125
Doesn't sound like you
guys are very close.

165
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:57,083
It's not like I have a
problem with her or anything.

166
00:10:57,166 --> 00:11:00,833
But she goes to my school,
and we're in the same class,

167
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:03,541
which means that people are
always comparing me to her,

168
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:05,166
and I hate that.

169
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,250
Yeah, I getcha.

170
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:13,375
[YUZU]
Sounds like my little sister.

171
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:15,541
But that wasn't the
point of my story!

172
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:18,958
I wanted to tell you about the
amazing girl I met earlier--

173
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:21,583
Wait, so a girl was
your wonderful person?

174
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:23,583
Uh. Gosh, Yuzu.

175
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:26,625
Maybe if you would quit
interrupting me, you'd find out.

176
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:27,541
[YUZU chuckles]

177
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:29,125
I'm sorry.

178
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:33,416
I do wanna hear about this girl.

179
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,583
It's just that, from the
way you explained it,

180
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:37,750
I could've sworn you
were talking about a guy.

181
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:40,250
I don't see why it
surprises you that much.

182
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:41,791
It's not all that complicated.

183
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:43,791
Whenever I find somebody
I have feelings for,

184
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:45,708
it doesn't matter
what their gender is.

185
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,958
This time, the person I like
just happens to be a girl.

186
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,208
Oh.

187
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:54,875
Well, "happens" is the
wrong word. It was fate!

188
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:58,541
[YUZU] She says it like it's
the simplest thing in the world.

189
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:01,458
I wish I had remembered to
ask for her name, though.

190
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:05,000
Because now I have no way
of ever finding her again.

191
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,958
[SARA] But hey, if it's meant
to be, it'll work out.

192
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:14,416
[YUZU] Why was it my fate
to fall in love with Mei?

193
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:35,916
[phone buzzing]

194
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
What's up, Yuzu?
Are you almost here?

195
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:40,041
[YUZU]
I just got off at Kyoto Station.

196
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:42,708
Send me the address and I'll
be there as soon as I can.

197
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:45,291
[HARUMI] Sounds good.
I'll keep an eye out for you.

198
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:46,250
Um.

199
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:47,416
[HARUMI]
Hm?

200
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:52,708
Did Mei mention me at all?
Does she seem worried?

201
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:53,958
[HARUMI]
Hm?

202
00:12:56,625 --> 00:13:00,958
[HARUMI] Sorry. She's totally
silent, as per usual.

203
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:02,416
Why?

204
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,458
[YUZU]
No reason. I'll see ya soon.

205
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:12,166
I found out where I'm going.

206
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,291
Good! We should compare.

207
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:20,833
That's perfect, it'll be
like our own private trip!

208
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:58,250
[BOTH chuckle]

209
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:07,500
They're still so far
ahead of us!

210
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:08,333
Yeah.

211
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:09,708
[SARA]
Hm?

212
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:11,000
It's okay.

213
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:13,250
There's no point in getting
all stressed out.

214
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:14,500
Yeah, but--

215
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:17,500
Come on, I'm sure we'll
catch up to them soon.

216
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:23,416
If there's something
else on your mind,

217
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,166
feel free to tell me about it.

218
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,333
[YUZU]
Hm?

219
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:32,375
This time, the person I like
just happens to be a girl!

220
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:35,250
Well, actually, it might
be the kind of thing

221
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:36,750
you can help me out with.

222
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:38,458
What's up?

223
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:40,791
'Kay, I'm just gonna say it.

224
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:44,666
See, I kinda have
a crush on this girl.

225
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,666
Problem is, she's
also my stepsister.

226
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:52,500
It took me a long time, but
I finally got close to her.

227
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:56,583
And then on Christmas,
our relationship hit a snag.

228
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:57,833
It got awkward,

229
00:14:57,916 --> 00:15:01,333
and we've hardly spoken
to each other since.

230
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:06,500
[MEI] So now, I think I know
what it is you want from me.

231
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:08,916
I was so happy she opened up.

232
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,416
In the moment, I must've
let my mind go blank.

233
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,666
[YUZU]
The things I want to do...

234
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,833
Things I've always wanted
to do with Mei...

235
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,333
[YUZU]
I just...

236
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:27,666
[YUZU] I love Mei,
so I should be with her.

237
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,750
[YUZU]
I got scared!

238
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:40,541
It'll be all right,
Yuzu. Cheer up.

239
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:42,458
Sounds to me like you were
just having an off day

240
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:44,333
when all that went down.

241
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:52,625
Even though we just
met this morning,

242
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:55,416
I can already tell you're
a really loving person.

243
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,750
And if it's clear to me,

244
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:59,375
then I promise you that
girl can see it too.

245
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,916
Sara.

246
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,458
We crossed paths for a reason.
There's no doubt in my mind.

247
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:09,083
Whatever happens,
I'll be rooting for you.

248
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:12,000
You're so sweet. Thank you.

249
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:18,500
How 'bout that?
We're in the same hotel.

250
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:21,208
[SARA] You know I'm all
about fate and everything,

251
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:24,750
but this many coincidences in
a row is downright creepy.

252
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,708
[NINA]
Sara!

253
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:34,208
Hey!

254
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:36,166
Ah!

255
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,875
Yay! Thank goodness
you got here safely!

256
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:41,375
I told you not to worry
when I called you!

257
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,625
We're in high school, remember?

258
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:45,625
Huh? Uh.

259
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:46,750
You're twins?

260
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:49,583
Stand up, Nina! Say hi to Yuzu!

261
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:51,250
We're BFFs now.

262
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:53,166
It's nice to meet you.

263
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:56,166
Hey, Yuzu!

264
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:59,291
[YUZU]
So tall!

265
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:02,125
[YUZU] I should probably try
to find my classmates now.

266
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:04,291
[SARA] You're gonna be
here a few days, right?

267
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:06,208
We should hang out again!

268
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:09,541
[YUZU]
Yeah! I'll see you around!

269
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:11,208
[SARA chuckles]

270
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:16,666
[NINA]
Hm?

271
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:22,791
[gasps]

272
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:27,708
[NINA]
Hey, Sara, is that her?

273
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:30,291
Huh? Is who her?

274
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:36,166
[SARA gasps]

275
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:38,500
It's the girl I met earlier!

276
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:40,250
Uh, hey! Wait up!

277
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:41,750
Excuse me!

278
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:44,416
You two again?
From the train station.

279
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,500
[SARA]
Yes!

280
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:47,291
My name is Sara Tachibana!

281
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:50,791
And this is my
little sister, Nina!

282
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:53,166
Please don't think
I'm a weirdo, but...

283
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,791
Would you tell me
what your name is?

284
00:17:57,791 --> 00:18:00,458
[SARA] Our school is staying
at this hotel too, Mei.

285
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:03,041
I'm sure we'll get
more chances to talk!

286
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:04,583
How nice.

287
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:09,791
[HIMEKO]
I've had it with you!

288
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:11,666
It's called a group
activity for a reason.

289
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,958
You have to stay with the group!

290
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:21,458
[YUZU]
Mei.

291
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:25,208
Sounds to me like you were
just having an off day

292
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:27,041
when all that went down.

293
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,875
Are you listening to me?

294
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:31,458
Sorry, but I gotta go.

295
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:32,666
I need to take
care of something,

296
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,833
and I can't put it
off any longer.

297
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:36,041
Hold on a minute!

298
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:38,166
Don't you run from me!

299
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,750
[YUZU]
Mei, wait!

300
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:50,791
Do you think I could maybe
have a word with you alone?

301
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:57,208
[HIMEKO]
Yuzu Aihara!

302
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:00,916
Come.

303
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,791
Catch you later, okay?

304
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:10,958
[SARA sighs]

305
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:13,375
[SARA] Coulda done
without that lecture.

306
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:15,458
I don't understand why
I had to get yelled at

307
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:17,541
when you were the one who
went off on your own.

308
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:18,625
Well, nobody forced you

309
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:21,083
to go into the meeting
room, Nina, gah.

310
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:23,500
Why do you follow me
everywhere I go?

311
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:26,333
Uh-oh. Did I lose it?

312
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:29,000
What is it now?

313
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:31,666
I can't find the Tokyo-exclusive
Yuzubocchi strap

314
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,458
you bought for me!

315
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,166
Where did it go?

316
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,416
[SARA sighs]

317
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,375
Jeez, Nina, that thing
was the whole reason

318
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:42,708
we got in trouble
in the first place.

319
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,750
[crying]

320
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:50,208
--I'm so sorry, Sara!
--[SARA] Oh, come on, don't cry!

321
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:53,833
I'm gonna go find it right now!

322
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:55,333
What?

323
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:58,208
Wait, don't! It's
almost dinner time!

324
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:05,875
[YUZU]
It's cold here, huh?

325
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:08,125
[MEI]
Yes.

326
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:11,625
Hey, Mei, why didn't you
wake me up this morning?

327
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:13,083
We always walk to
school together,

328
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:14,666
so I thought you would.

329
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,125
I don't see how it's my fault

330
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:18,250
you didn't leave the
house on time today.

331
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:20,333
It's not my job to wake you up.

332
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:22,416
That's not what I
was trying to say.

333
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,791
So, is that why you
wanted to talk?

334
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:28,333
No, actually, it's
about Christmas.

335
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:30,875
You know, when we were
on the couch together?

336
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:34,375
I was really happy when you
expressed your feelings to me.

337
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:39,041
But, um... you and I are
still sisters, Mei,

338
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:40,833
so I felt like we
were starting to get

339
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:43,416
a little too physical
with each other.

340
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:49,333
Then, I have a question.

341
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:51,083
[gasps]

342
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,625
I want to know your true
feelings about me, Yuzu,

343
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:56,083
and please tell me honestly.

344
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:57,916
[NINA whines]

345
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,333
[NINA]
I hope I can find it.

346
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:04,333
[NINA]
Huh?

347
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:06,000
There it is!

348
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:09,833
I was about to give up!

349
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:11,875
[YUZU]
I don't know.

350
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:15,250
That's a tough question.

351
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:20,500
You kind of caught me off guard,
so it's hard to answer that.

352
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:24,625
Um, how do I say it?

353
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:28,791
If I'm being honest...
I, uh, love you.

354
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:29,916
[gasps]

355
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,625
Because we're stepsisters.

356
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:33,250
So I'm saying you
mean a lot to me

357
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,750
since you're part
of my family now.

358
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:36,791
Does that make sense?

359
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:37,708
Apologies.

360
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:39,125
[gasps]

361
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:42,791
What happened before,
please forget the entire thing.

362
00:23:32,166 --> 00:23:35,083
If you have a shot, you
should go for it. Just try.

363
00:23:35,166 --> 00:23:37,666
[SARA]
I saw my angel of destiny again!

364
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,666
[YUZU] I keep spouting
off these empty words

365
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:41,916
that don't mean anything.

366
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,875
Just tell me whether
or not you need me.


367
00:23:43,958 --> 00:23:46,958
[YUZU] Right! No one loves
Mei more than I do!
