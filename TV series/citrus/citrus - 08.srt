1
00:00:29,833 --> 00:00:32,083
Well, there you are.
Why did you take so long?

2
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:33,666
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

3
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,416
I had to go home
and change my clothes.

4
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:39,000
But why? We're supposed to
be out on a date today.

5
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:40,333
I wish you would
just forget about

6
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:43,125
all the stupid school rules
for a little while.

7
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:52,958
Hey, Mei!

8
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,291
[YUZU]
Aw! How cute is this?

9
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:24,333
[MATSURI] I didn't know you
liked that stuff, Yuzu.

10
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:25,583
[YUZU]
Hm?

11
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:27,583
No, I was actually
thinking about it for Mei.

12
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:30,541
[MATSURI]
Oh. I shoulda guessed.

13
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:34,000
Whoa.

14
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:36,000
Hey, watch out. You
almost knocked me over.

15
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:39,791
Sorry, your body's
just so snuggly!

16
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:43,458
[MATSURI]
I gotta ask, though.

17
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:49,250
[MATSURI] Why did you have
to bring her with us?

18
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:51,083
I dunno. I just thought, uh...

19
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:53,333
[MATSURI]
Yeah, yeah, say no more.

20
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:56,666
You've got it pretty bad, huh?

21
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:00,416
Listen, I already told you,
Mei and I are not like that!

22
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,416
Don't bother denying it, Yuzu.

23
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,708
I know you wanna
do stuff with her.

24
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:06,000
Like touch her here.

25
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:08,958
And a few other
places too, right?

26
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:11,250
Of course not! Don't be weird!

27
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:13,708
Yeah, okay. In that case.

28
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:16,500
Good. It's probably not love.

29
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:17,583
What?

30
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:18,666
Think about it.

31
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,291
If two girls are super close,

32
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:22,125
but they're not doing
any sexy stuff,

33
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:23,750
then aren't they just
friends, basically?

34
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:25,958
Hush!

35
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:27,625
That's not quite right either.

36
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:31,833
You guys are stepsisters.
That's not sexual like at all.

37
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:33,583
Don't worry, Yuzu.

38
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:37,666
Maybe she doesn't feel that way,
but you know for sure I do.

39
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:40,291
I would even have sex with you.

40
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:43,333
Hey, don't say that in public.

41
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:44,666
[MATSURI laughs]

42
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,708
[MATSURI]
But I really mean it!

43
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:51,208
Seriously, I've loved
you for years now,

44
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,375
as long as I can remember.

45
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:12,583
[MATSURI]
You're mean, Yuzu.

46
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:19,375
[YUZU]
Matsuri!

47
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,500
[MEI]
What's wrong?

48
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:33,250
[YUZU] Matsuri just ran
away out of nowhere.

49
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,000
I'm gonna go find her real quick
and see what's going on.

50
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:38,166
[MEI] Don't you think it'd be
better if I came along too?

51
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:42,125
[YUZU]
Actually, I should go by myself.

52
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:46,500
Wait for us where you were,
okay? I'll be right back!

53
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:59,541
What the heck is her
stupid problem, anyway?

54
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:02,583
A date is supposed to be
between two people.

55
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:06,291
Dude, she's gonna murder you.

56
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:08,375
You're lookin' at her, too.

57

[ARCADE GAME A]
Game Start!

58
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:11,208
Why did she have to bring

59
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:14,416
that student council
bitch along with her?

60
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,625
[ARCADE GAME A]
Owie!

61
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,500
You just had to come
out, didn't you?!

62
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:23,333
They're only coming out because
you put money into the machine.

63
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:26,875
[ARCADE GAME A]
That's it, now I'm mad!

64
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:34,458
"Come out," huh?
Well, there's an idea.

65
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:36,125
Hey, you two.

00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:37,458
[BOYS]
Uh-oh!

67
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:40,166
I could see you the whole time.

68
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:44,041
So, you like panties, huh?
I'll tell you what, then...

69
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:47,041
See, I told you she'd get mad.

70
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:49,916
Yeah, shut up.
You were doin' it too.

71

[BOYS gasp]

72
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:56,125
Come on. Let's make a deal.

73
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:04,708
Man, where did
Matsuri run off to?

74
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:07,416
I guess I'll just
keep calling her.

75
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:12,125
[MATSURI]
Yuzu?

76
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:14,125
Hey, I'm so happy you
finally picked up.

77
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:16,916
So where are you? I've been
looking for you everywhere.

78
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,041
[MATSURI] Sorry, I'm not
really at a stopping point

79
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:20,291
in this game.

80
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:22,250
I'll meet back up
with you later, okay?

81
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:24,041
See ya in a bit, though.

82
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:24,750
[click]

83
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:26,875
Uh. Did you hang up?

84
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:34,458
[MATSURI] So, looks like Yuzu
ditched you to look for me.

85
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:41,083
Apparently, she cares
more about me than you.

86
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:42,708
Did you speak to Yuzu?

87
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:45,250
[MATSURI] Yep, we just
got off the phone.

88
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:46,791
I told her she should give up.

89
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:49,875
I thought maybe the two of us
could have a chat instead.

90
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:52,666
One little sister to another.

91
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:02,791
Wha...?

92
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,458
[YUZU]
Where'd she go?

93
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,916
[MATSURI]
Good, no one'll bother us here.

94
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,708
For real, you can cut the act.

95
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:18,041
It's obvious you've
been deceiving Yuzu.

96
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:21,000
You're such a little slut, Mei.

97
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,375
I knew something didn't
smell right with you.

98
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:27,125
Yuzu always wanted
a boyfriend so bad.

99
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:31,041
Makes it hard to believe she's
into girls all of a sudden.

100
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:36,416
See, the thing is,
she's a good person.

101
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,375
Why do you think she
accepted you as you were

102
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:40,458
right off the bat?

103
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:42,333
I mean, like even with
all those pathetic,

104
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:45,666
disgusting fetishes of yours.

105
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,916
You don't care if she's
your own stepsister.

106
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,541
You'll fall for anyone who
can stand to put up with you.

107
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:52,875
It's unreal.

108
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:55,458
I can't believe how
easy you are.

109
00:08:56,833 --> 00:09:00,666
[MATSURI] Yuzu is my sister,
so leave her alone.

110
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,791
I don't want you putting
your dirty hands on her.

111
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:07,041
Are you finished talking?
I've heard enough.

112
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:08,416
Yep.

113
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,583
You stole Yuzu's kiss.
And now, it's mine.

114
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,416
I should probably
be heading back.

115
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,208
I'm sure Yuzu must
be getting worried.

116
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:42,541
I suggest you do the same thing.

117

[laughs]

118
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:57,875
I can't believe she
just kissed me.

00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:00,750
That girl's even crazier
than I figured.

120
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:06,416
Anyway.

00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:10,208
Did you boys get anything?

Yeah, is this okay?

123
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:18,416
[BOY B] I know you said
to take a picture

124
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,500
of her hitting you, but...

125
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:23,083
[MATSURI]
No, I like this even better.

Thanks a lot.
You guys did great.

have your attention, please?

Your party is...

00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:49,500
Are they calling for
a high school girl?

Jeez, where have you been?

I was like totally getting ready
to send out a search party!

It's times like this I wish
you carried a phone!

I still have to get a
hold of Matsuri, though.

140
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:19,833
I called her, but
she didn't answer.

141
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:21,833
I'm really worried.

142
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:25,250
I'm so sorry, Mei.

143
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:29,083
I had no idea she was gonna
stir up this much trouble.

144
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:30,583
It's all right.
Nothing happened.

Oh! There she is!

00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:40,875
What's up, Matsuri?

148
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:42,166
What?

149
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,375
[YUZU]
Look! It's snowing!

150
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:52,875
Man, it's sure got cold fast!

151
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:57,250
[YUZU] That was totally
rude of Matsuri.

152
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:58,958
She could've at least
given us a heads-up

153
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:01,666
before she went home.

154
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:05,041
What'd I tell you? She's always
acting like such a brat.

155
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:08,500
And yet, she's still...
important to you?

156
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:11,291
Yeah. Oh, how should I put it?

157
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:13,291
The very first day
I met Matsuri,

158
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:16,333
we had both recently moved
into the same neighborhood.

159
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:20,083
[UME]
Yuzu?

160
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,041
I'm heading out
to work, sweetie.

161
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:24,500
[YUZU]
Bye!

162
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:27,541
See ya later.
Watch the house for me.

163
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:29,166
Okay!

164
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,541
[chuckles]

165
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:34,916
Have a good day!

166
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:39,416
[YUZU]
Hm?

167
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:45,916
[YUZU] She was a lonely
little girl, too.

168
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,666
As soon as I saw
how alike we were,

169
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:52,166
I thought it would be nice
if we could be like sisters.

170
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,625
[YUZU] And that's how
we became friends.

171
00:12:57,708 --> 00:12:58,958
But then again,
it might have seemed

172
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:01,666
completely different
in Matsuri's eyes.

173
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,583
I was pretty bossy
a lot of the time,

174
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:06,750
so I always thought I
bugged the crap out of her.

175
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:09,666
[ANNOUNCER B]
We sincerely apologize.

176
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,000
Uh-oh.

177
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:13,250
[ANNOUNCER B] We are also
expecting several delays

178
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:14,125
caused by the current snowfall.

179
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:15,500
[YUZU]
Huh?

180
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:24,791
I hope Matsuri made it
home okay in this weather.

181
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:27,125
She left early
because I was there.

182
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:29,500
I can't help but
feel responsible.

183
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:32,291
No, no, no, don't worry
about that, Mei, seriously!

184
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:34,833
There was nothing wrong
with you coming along.

185
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:45,708
[YUZU] Besides, Matsuri going
home early was my fault.

186
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:47,625
She invited me to hang
out with her today,

187
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:51,583
and I kept turning my
attention back to Mei.

188
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:55,708
I totally understand
why she'd be mad.

189
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:59,083
I have to find a way
to make it up to her.

190
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:00,958
[MEI]
I'm sorry.

191
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:01,708
[YUZU]
Huh?

192
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:03,583
You look terribly upset,

193
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:05,791
and that's making me
feel even guiltier.

194
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:06,541
[YUZU gasps]

195
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:07,541
[YUZU]
Don't be sorry.

196
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:10,208
I wasn't trying
to bring you down!

197
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:12,416
[YUZU]
Jeez, get it together!

198
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,750
Why am I being so awkward?

199
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:17,500
Man, I wish I was
as calm as Mei.

200
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:19,625
What?

201
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:21,875
Uh, it's nothing. I'm fine.

202
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:24,541
[YUZU]
No, wait. Mei only looks calm!

203
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:28,583
She's always acting like
a huge weirdo, remember?

204
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:32,041
Cold on the outside,
but intense on the inside.

205
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:37,291
[YUZU]
Hey, Mei?

206
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:39,416
It's really cold, huh?

207
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,541
Do you think we
could hold hands?

208
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:46,875
It's probably okay for sisters
to do that much, right?

209
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:48,541
I suppose.

210
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:55,541
[YUZU]
Oh my god, I'm so happy!

211
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:05,458
Your skin's so warm.

212
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:09,541
But then again, it always is.

213
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:11,791
When we started sleeping
in the same bed,

214
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:14,125
it was so hot,
I couldn't tolerate it.

215
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:16,166
But now that the
weather's turned cold,

216
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,333
it's actually pleasant.

217
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:19,833
Totally.

218
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:21,250
[MEI]
It's strange.

219
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:24,458
I'm constantly seeking out
warmth from other people

220
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:27,166
because I'm so
messed up on my own.

221
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:40,041
[YUZU] Well, I can't speak
for everybody, but...

222
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:41,958
All I know is that
if you're messed up,

223
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:45,000
then I must be like the
biggest disaster ever.

224
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:48,416
Look at me.

225
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,250
Always wanting to touch
you, or waiting for you...

226
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:51,583
[MEI]
Yuzu.

227
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:53,125
Looks like the buses
have quit running.

228
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:55,083
Why am I telling you all this?

229
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:56,458
Really?

230
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,833
Crap, we were
waiting for nothing.

231
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:06,375
Then, let's walk.

232
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,875
I hope it'll snow on
Christmas this year, too.

233
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:14,750
So, you do Christmas?
Interesting.

234
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:21,041
Yeah, my family puts on
a giant party every year.

235
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:25,833
And this time is special
because you'll be there.

236
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:29,166
So, make sure you put it
on your calendar, okay?

237
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:37,875
All right, I will.

238
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:13,541
[sighs]

239
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:14,791
How disappointing.

240
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:16,083
While everyone else
is getting ready

241
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:17,791
to enjoy the Christmas season,

242
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:20,708
we're stuck at school working
on the budget for next year.

243
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:22,416
[MARUTA]
Don't be upset.

244
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,833
It won't take much longer.

245
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:26,041
We'll have our snacks
and cake in no time.

246
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:27,291
Focus on that.

247
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:28,916
Plus, having something
fun to look forward to

248
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,458
keeps me motivated!

249
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:34,000
You sure do love to eat,
don't you, Maruta?

250
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:35,375
You've got a point, though.

251
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:36,916
I'm most likely
feeling impatient

252
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,833
because I'm eager to
spend the holiday season

253
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:40,041
with the president.

254
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:41,416
[MARUTA] That's true,
and you first-years

255
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,833
have your school trip
coming up in February too.

256
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:47,833
Precisely! I must
solidify our bond!

257
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:49,500
She'll forget all
about Yuzu Aihara

258
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:51,791
and spend the whole
trip alongside me!

259
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:53,125
[MARUTA giggles]

260
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:55,583
See, I knew you would find
a way to get motivated!

261
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:56,958
Just picture it.

262
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:59,250
Alone together on Christmas,
discussing our plans,

263
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:01,125
right under the mistletoe.

264
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:09,208
I'm sorry to interrupt
you. I'll be brief.

265
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:12,708
Oh! President Aihara. How
much of that did you hear?

266
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:14,333
It's about the
year-end schedule.

267
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:16,625
Can we finish things
up by the 23rd?

268
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:18,666
I was hoping to be off
after closing ceremonies

269
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,916
on the 24th, if possible.

270
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:26,500
[HIMEKO]
Looking at the workload,

271
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:28,291
I think that can happen, sure.

272
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:30,083
But I'm surprised, President.

273
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:32,875
You've never been one to
rearrange the schedule before.

274
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:37,416
I know that, but I have
a family function.

275
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,125
I'm sorry to make
a selfish request

276
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:41,041
during such a busy
part of the year.

277
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:42,750
There's no need to be
concerned, though,

278
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:45,625
and I'll finish the rest
of this work tomorrow.

279
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:50,041
Is that really all you were
worried about? Just relax!

280
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:52,250
You have us on
your side, remember?

281
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:54,000
Go ahead and enjoy yourself.

282
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:56,000
We'll take care of
everything on this end.

283
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:57,541
This is a special Christmas.

284
00:18:57,625 --> 00:19:01,416
It's your first one with
your new family, right?

285
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,875
Go spend time with them.

286
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:06,208
I mean, your whole family!

287
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:07,833
I'd better not find
out it's just you

288
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:10,583
and that Yuzu Aihara
girl together!

289
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:13,541
Please try to calm down,
Vice President.

290
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:18,041
[HIMEKO]
Have a good time, okay?

291
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:19,583
[MEI]
Thank you.

292
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:24,500
Looks like it's not gonna be

293
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:27,291
a white Christmas
this year, after all.

294
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,125
Eh, that's okay.

295
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:45,958
[HARUMI]
Hey, Mama! Please buy these!

296
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:47,500
Nah. You don't need 'em.

297
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,708
[HARUMI]
You're so rude!

298
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:50,791
I make a joke and you
just shut me down?

299
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:52,083
Sorry, but I don't have time

300
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:54,416
for the whole comedy
routine today, Harumin.

301
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,375
[HARUMI whines]

302
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:56,916
[HARUMI grunts]

303
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,500
[GIRL A yelps]

304
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:02,541
Aww! I wanna go to the
Christmas party! Can I?

305
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:05,375
I can't do that. It's a
family-only thing. Sorry.

306
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:07,791
[whines]

307
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:09,000
[HARUMI]
Hm?

308
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:10,666
You're really getting
into this, Yuzucchi.

309
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,916
Making all that by hand?

310
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,791
[YUZU] I never made a
cake from scratch before,

311
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:16,125
but I really wanna try.

312
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:18,750
The rest of the recipes
are pretty standard.

313
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:21,208
It'll work out okay. I think.

314
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:24,416
Wow, color me impressed.

315
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,500
Besides the few things I
picked up from Grandma,

316
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:28,416
I suck at cooking.

317
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:35,666
With all those domestic skills,
you'll be a great wife someday.

318
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:40,708
[YUZU]
A wife, huh?

319
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:44,125
You know, I kinda like
the sound of that.

320
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:53,208
[door opens]

321
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:54,500
We're all finished!

322
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:56,666
We've thoroughly inspected
the school grounds.

323
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:57,833
[MEI]
Thank you.

324
00:20:57,916 --> 00:21:00,041
Isn't it about time
for you to go home?

325
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:01,583
Let me walk with you.

326
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:05,791
No, that's all right. I'll be
here a while. My apologies.

327
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:07,541
Well, if that's what you want.

328
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:09,625
Have a nice night, then.

329
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:21,166
[YUZU]
Hmm...

330
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:28,958
Ooh. I'll borrow this!

331
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:36,166
There!

332
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,791
Don't you get exhausted working
so late all by your lonesome?

333
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:57,833
Are you surprised
to see me again?

334
00:23:32,375 --> 00:23:35,166
Come on. You wanna
warm me up, yeah?

335
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:37,250
Like you did for Yuzu.

336
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:40,541
[MEI] She'll never go back
to the way she was.

337
00:23:40,625 --> 00:23:41,625
[MATSURI]
Yeah, but that's okay.

338
00:23:41,708 --> 00:23:44,208
She'll always be
my older sister.

339
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:47,000
[MEI] That girl desperately
needs you, Yuzu.
