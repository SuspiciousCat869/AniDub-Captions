1
00:00:07,666 --> 00:00:08,958
[gasps]

2
00:00:18,791 --> 00:00:19,750
That's fine.

3
00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:21,041
[SARA gasps]

4
00:01:54,666 --> 00:01:56,458
Huh?


5
00:01:56,541 --> 00:01:58,375
The girl you're
head-over-heels about,


6
00:01:58,458 --> 00:02:02,000
she's also my sister's destiny.


7
00:02:02,083 --> 00:02:03,791
[YUZU]
I get it.

8
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:06,416
[NINA] At first,
I felt bad for all this,

9
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,666
but now I'm glad I decided
to stick my neck out.

10
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,875
You made a promise, remember?

11
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:13,083
She's in love,

12
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:15,625
and you told me you
were gonna support her.

13
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:19,083
[YUZU] I can't believe Mei is
the girl Sara's in love with.

14
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:20,333
[NINA]
That said,

15
00:02:20,416 --> 00:02:24,708
I'm not letting you butt
in on their date, 'kay?

16
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:27,875
[YUZU] How did everything
turn out like this?

17
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:31,083
I wanted to tell you all about
the amazing girl that I met!

18
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:32,416
Well, actually,

19
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,583
the person that I like
just happens to be a girl.

20
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:38,416
I saw my angel of destiny
again, isn't that great?

21
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:45,791
[SARA] I know! But even so,
you still love her, right?

22
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:49,291
[SARA]
Then do something about it!

23
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:51,541
Your heart always knows
what's best for you, Yuzu.

24
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:54,750
All you have to do is
learn to listen to it!

25
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:57,500
Look, Nina. I'm sorry.

26
00:02:57,583 --> 00:03:00,791
I promised, but I can't
keep it this time.

27
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:03,041
[NINA]
Huh?

28
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:04,791
You what?

29
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:07,416
I thought you and my sister
were supposed to be friends!

30
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,541
[YUZU]
We are friends!

31
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:10,875
[NINA] Sara really cares
about you, Yuzu!

32
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:13,625
She would want you to be happy
if it were the other way around!

33
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:15,916
[YUZU]
I know. I feel the same way!

34
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,291
What's with you?

35
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:18,708
Come on!

36
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:22,000
How can you say you're friends,
and then go and do this?

37
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:24,916
[NINA]
Hm?

38
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,416
It's because Sara's my friend

39
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,791
that I know I'm doing
the right thing.

40
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:42,250
Poor Sara.

41
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:47,791
[NINA]
Wait!

42
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:51,958
What the heck are you
trying to do, Nina?

43
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:54,125
You're not giving me
any choice, Yuzu!

44
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:55,875
Ugh, don't make a scene!

45
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:58,875
If you're not gonna allow those
two to enjoy their date,

46
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:00,666
then I'm not gonna
let you leave!

47
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,333
Why is Sara having
a perfect date

48
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:04,416
so important to you
in the first place?

49
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,125
They're the ones
going out, not you!

50
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,791
Fine, I'll tell you why.

51
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:15,291
My sister's constantly
thinking about other people.

52
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:17,500
She's someone who puts
everyone's happiness

53
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:18,750
before her own.

54
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,125
Don't you see?

55
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:23,250
If you tell her that you're
in love with Mei, too,

56
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:29,000
then I just know she'll
surrender on the spot.

57
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:32,000
I love my sister, Yuzu.

58
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:33,791
And that means it's
my job to make sure

59
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:37,166
that she doesn't miss her
chance at being happy.

60
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:41,041
Sisters should always help
each other, no matter what!

61
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:42,833
Yeah, I know.

62
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:47,083
[phone ringing]

63
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:49,000
Hello, this is Yuzu.

64
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:51,500
[SARA] It's Sara.
Can we please meet up?

65
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,666
Uh, I need to give
you something.

66
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,375
Sara just called me.

67
00:04:57,458 --> 00:05:01,250
She asked to meet up, and I
also wanna talk things over.

68
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:03,541
No!

69
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:06,500
This could destroy my
friendship with Sara,

70
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:08,875
and Mei might even turn me down.

71
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:12,250
But still, if I don't
confess my real feelings,

72
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:15,375
then I'm positive
I'm gonna regret it.

73
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:18,541
So please let me do
what I have to do.

74
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:29,750
[NINA]
All right.

75
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:31,750
But I'm coming, too.

76
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:38,500
[YUZU]
Sara!

77
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:41,000
Hey. Where's Mei?

78
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:44,625
There's no need to worry.
Our date's not over yet.

79
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:48,625
Although, I told her I needed
a few minutes to talk to Yuzu.

80
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:51,833
Here.

81
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:53,083
I found this at the bath,

82
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:55,750
and I couldn't help
but look at it.

83
00:05:57,541 --> 00:06:01,250
So, it turns out you and
I like the same person.

84
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:06,416
Yeah. Sorry, but I'm about to--

85
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,625
Tell her your true feelings?

86
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:10,958
I've already said
my piece to her.

87
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:13,041
So it's only fair if
you get to do the same.

88
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:14,916
But you said
she's your destiny!

89
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,041
[SARA]
I know.

90
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:18,666
Even if you do confess,

91
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:22,125
I don't think she's gonna
respond the way you want.

92
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:26,125
Really? Are you sure?

93
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:29,250
Couldn't be more sure.

94
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:33,291
[chuckles]

95
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:37,500
Yeah, that's exactly what
I thought you'd say.

96
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:40,000
In the time I've spent
with Mei so far,

97
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:42,083
I've seen what a
dedicated, mature,

98
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:44,916
and wonderful person she is.

99
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,333
However...

100
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:47,958
She's still a scared little girl

101
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:50,500
who's trying to
protect her heart.

102
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:54,000
And you, well,
you're no different.

103
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:57,625
I think you two should try to
understand each other better.

104
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:00,666
You think we're similar?

105
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:04,041
Yep. Here ya go.

106
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:09,083
I think Mei's at the Yasaka
Shrine. Go and see her.

107
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:11,083
[YUZU]
You're staying?

108
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:15,583
[SARA] I'm not the person
she's waiting to talk to.

109
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:25,125
[YUZU]
Here.

110
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:30,041
I want you to take this.

111
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:32,541
I don't know if
it actually works,

112
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:35,333
but I hope it brings
you happiness.

113
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:38,875
[chuckles]

114
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,625
Wow, after all that's happened,

115
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:43,750
I'm the luckiest girl on
this whole school trip!

116
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:46,208
I'll be here to back you up!

117
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,166
Thanks, Sara. See ya.

118
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:55,916
What's with you? That's dumb!

119
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,375
I thought Mei was your--

120
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:58,625
Destiny?

121
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:01,208
So why did you--?

122
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:05,833
[SARA] I fell for Mei and
became friends with Yuzu.

123
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:08,000
Maybe my fate was to
bring those two together.

124
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:10,875
Isn't that kinda cool
to think about?

125
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,083
I don't think
that's cool at all!

126
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:18,916
When you talk about
that fate stuff,

127
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,750
it always makes me feel like
you're holding yourself back.

128
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:25,083
I can't deal with the idea of
you letting your own dreams

129
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:28,416
just slip away, okay, Sara?

130
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,416
Nina.

131
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:34,291
[NINA] I'm your sister.
I want the best for you.

132
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:36,958
[SARA] I'm not holding
myself back, though.

133
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:38,416
[NINA]
Huh?

134
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:42,125
Being a good friend to Yuzu,
and breaking up with Mei,

135
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:45,708
those were things I did
because I wanted to.

136
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:47,291
As for the destiny stuff,

137
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:51,000
I think I just needed it to give
me a little push, that's all.

138
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:54,041
Plus, it's more romantic
that way, right?

139
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:57,625
[NINA]
I just want to you to be happy.

140
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:02,458
[SARA] I have the best
little sister in the world.

141
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:04,500
How could I not be?

142
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:11,541
[YUZU] We should try to
understand each other better.

143
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:14,500
That's kind of like
what Matsuri said.

144
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:16,083
Here's the thing.

145
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:20,041
If you like someone, then you
have to consider their feelings.

146
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:22,125
[YUZU]
What does Mei want?

147
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:25,125
More importantly,
what does she need?

148
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,958
[YUZU] I've made her
the center of my world

149
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:33,000
ever since we first met.

150
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:34,416
But now that I think about it,

151
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:38,416
was that really the
best thing for Mei?

152
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:42,833
Or was I just imposing on
her by acting that way?

153
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,166
And then...

154
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,041
This'll make you happy, right?

155
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:48,333
[YUZU]
That Christmas night...

156
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:52,875
[YUZU] That's when things
got really messed up.

157
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:54,250
I love Mei.

158
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:56,916
It's not like I didn't want
to do stuff with her.

159
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,916
I just didn't want it
to go down like that.

160
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,875
Not that it's Mei's fault.

161
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:06,750
She said she needed someone
to accept her feelings,

162
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:10,291
and I wasn't able to.

163
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:15,458
Why did I act the way I did?

164
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:19,583
Maybe we're both
the problem here.

165
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:22,750
[YUZU]
Neither of us could say it,

166
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:26,250
and neither of us
were ready to hear it.

167
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:32,000
But even if that's true...
I have no choice but to confess!

168
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:39,125
[sighs]

169
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:46,208
I wasn't gonna bother you, Yuzu,

170
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:48,541
but I forgot to tell you to
bring me back a souvenir.

171
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:50,583
Uh, and I was wondering,

172
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:53,666
how are things with Mei
and your school trip going?

173
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:57,000
That works.

174
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:01,750
Eh, it's whatever.

175
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:07,458
[MATSURI] I mean, it's Yuzu.
She'll figure it out.

176
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:13,083
[HIMEKO]
Aren't we there yet?

177
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:14,458
Good news.

178
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:15,625
I've broken our schedule
into five-minute intervals.

179
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,333
Oh, goodie.

180
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:19,458
Wait. That's Aihara!

181
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:25,250
Ah! Excuse me, sorry!

182
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:26,500
How typical.

183
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:28,625
There's never a dull
moment with her around.

184
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:32,000
Totally. It's been crazy
since Hurricane Yuzu blew in.

185
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:34,916
But I kinda think that's what
makes her so awesome.

186
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,041
[sighs]

187
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:37,916
I suppose that's true.

188
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,875
She's made my life
interesting, for sure.

189
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:43,333
She and the president can
both get so carried away

190
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:47,291
that they can't see what's
right in front of them.

191
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:50,625
Sometimes, I'm envious of that.

192
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:55,708
Well, VP, we should
get a move on.

193
00:11:55,791 --> 00:12:00,166
We've got statues to stare
at. Tons of 'em! Yay!

194
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,083
[YUZU]
Mei!

195
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:21,416
[YUZU]
Please don't be gone yet!

196
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:29,625
[YUZU]
Come on!

197
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:43,416
Mei! Talk to me!

198
00:12:56,208 --> 00:13:00,166
[YUZU] Oh, God. I'm so
glad I caught up to her!

199
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:03,083
This is starting
to get annoying.

200
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:06,166
I'm sorry, but there's
something I gotta say,

201
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:09,333
and I'm not letting it
go unsaid this time!

202
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:15,916
[MEI] Well, I have nothing
further to discuss with you.

203
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,708
[YUZU]
Uh! But!

204
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:20,000
Why can't you just listen?!

205
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:24,083
Wait up!

206
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:43,625
[YUZU] You are gonna hear me
out whether you want to or not!

207
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:47,291
So listen up, 'cause this
is happening, 'kay?

208
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:50,875
First of all, you confuse me!

209
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:53,625
One minute you're pushing
me down and kissing me,

210
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:59,250
and then you turn around and
get all clingy and fragile.

211
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:01,041
And just when I think
we're getting along,

212
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:03,458
you start acting like
you hate my guts!

213
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:06,541
Nothing you do makes
any sense to me!

214
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:13,208
[YUZU] But despite all that, you
have feelings for me, don't you?

215
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:17,333
[gasps]

216
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:26,541
[YUZU]
That Christmas night...

217
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:29,333
My heart was
racing for you, Mei.

218
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:32,875
Being that close to you
made me so happy.

219
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:35,500
I wasn't thinking of
your feelings, though,

220
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,833
so I couldn't accept them!

221
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:40,541
And then, the night
your dad came home,

222
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:43,583
I felt horrible, and I
agonized over it forever,

223
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:46,625
but I didn't do
anything to fix it!

224
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:50,875
I don't wanna go through any
of that stuff again, okay?

225
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:54,541
The truth is,
I'm in love with you.

226
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:58,083
And I can promise you,
I will need you.

227
00:14:58,166 --> 00:15:00,041
Always.

228
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:04,125
So, if maybe you feel the
same way that I do, then...

229
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:09,041
[YUZU]
...would you please kiss me?

230
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:53,416
[YUZU]
Thanks.

231
00:15:55,333 --> 00:16:00,375
But... I want one from you.

232
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:20,333
[NINA]
Hm?

233
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:27,166
[NINA]
Hey!

234
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,291
Sara, look! Yuzu
and Mei are here!

235
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:31,750
[giggles]

236
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:33,208
[SARA]
How 'bout that?

237
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:36,250
Looks like they didn't need
backup from me after all.

238
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,041
Oh, you helped
more than you think.

239
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:47,625
[YUZU] Hey, I'm sorry for
making you guys wait so long.

240
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:50,041
Oh, no. Don't worry about that.

241
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:53,291
There's still a little more time
before we have to go back home.

242
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:56,500
[YUZU] Listen, before
we do anything else,

243
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:57,750
I was hoping that Mei and I

244
00:16:57,833 --> 00:16:59,666
could have a quick
talk with you.

245
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,916
I know we've caused a
lot of trouble lately,

246
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,833
and we just wanted to apologize.

247
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:05,958
No, it's okay.

248
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:10,791
Uh, let's find a store then.

249
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:15,375
[NINA]
Hey.

250
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:18,583
You know somethin'? I'm hungry!

251
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:21,416
What do you say, Yuzu?
Wanna go grab a snack with me?

252
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,125
Huh? Like, now?

253
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:26,875
I wanna pay you back
for your kindness, okay?

254
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:28,708
[YUZU] Uh, it's no big
deal or anything--

255
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:31,750
No, don't be silly. I insist!

256
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:33,666
I'll tell you all of Sara's
embarrassing secrets.

257
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,208
So come on, it'll be fun!

258
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:36,625
Off we go!

259
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:39,166
[YUZU]
Help! Stranger danger!

260
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:43,875
[SARA]
I feel kinda bad for Yuzu.

261
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
But I figured I should
talk to you one-on-one.

262
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:52,791
Pretty good timing.

263
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:00,250
So, tell me,

264
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:03,291
were you able to find out
what your true feelings are?

265
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:05,333
I'm sorry.

266
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:06,083
[SARA]
Huh?

267
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:07,791
What are you sorry for?

268
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:10,500
[MEI] You've been nothing
but kind to me.

269
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:13,833
And I have nothing
to offer in return.

270
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:16,291
If there's any way to
make it up to you...

271
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:17,708
[SARA]
Mei!

272
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:22,625
That's enough. Stop being
so hard on yourself.

273
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:24,833
Even if your intentions
are honorable,

274
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:27,791
no matter what, the
only way I'll be happy

275
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:30,666
is if you get to be happy, too.

276
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,958
You could stand to be a
whole lot more selfish.

277
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:40,583
All right. I will say I
don't want to lose you.

278
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:41,708
[SARA chuckles]

279
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:43,291
Good.

280
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:45,625
Well then, I know how
to ease your mind.

281
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:48,333
I'll let you do me
a little favor!

282
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,041
[SARA] Okay, it's about
time for us to go home!

283
00:18:58,166 --> 00:19:00,375
We should all go to Kyoto
again one day soon!

284
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:01,541
Just us four!

285
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:04,791
That sounds awesome!
I'll call ya soon!

286
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:07,916
Cool! Looking forward to it!

287
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,416
See ya! Have a safe trip!

288
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:16,250
Those two, you think
we'll see 'em again?

289
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:19,000
Of course.

290
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:19,875
Yuzu?

291
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:21,125
[YUZU]
Hm?

292
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:24,208
[YUZU gasps]

293
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:26,500
You know that's my hand, right?

294
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:29,208
I'm aware. We should head back.

295
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:37,166
What's happening?
This is so crazy!

296
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,958
She started it and everything!

297
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:47,250
It's freezing outside,
but I feel so warm!

298
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:49,625
Don't be ridiculous.

299
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:55,166
[chuckles]

300
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:59,208
So, Sara, what'd you
talk about with Mei?

301
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:01,250
I made a little deal with her.

302
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:05,791
I said if she holds Yuzu's
hand, she's forgiven! Ha!

303
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:08,166
[NINA]
Here! I'll hold yours!

304
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,458
Sure.

305
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:14,000
[NINA giggles]

306
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:27,041
So, the fact that you kissed me
after I said all that stuff...

307
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:31,875
...does that mean you're,
you know, in love with me, too?

308
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:35,208
I don't know. We'll see
if dating works out.

309
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:38,416
[YUZU] Jeez. Can't you
say yes or no for once?

310
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,708
Uh.

311
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,541
Um, wait.

312
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:45,333
Did you just say that
we were dating?

313
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:51,250
[YUZU] Up till now, I had
never been in love before.

314
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,041
Can I ask something?

315
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:56,750
[YUZU]
I'm beyond clueless about love.

316
00:20:56,833 --> 00:21:00,125
Or at least, that's
what I used to think.

317
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:03,291
Could we kiss one more time?

318
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:25,166
[YUZU humming]

319
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:46,291
All done!

320
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:48,916
Here you go, girls. Take care!

321
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,458
Thanks, Mom! See ya!

322
00:21:51,541 --> 00:21:53,791
[MEI]
We'll be going now, Mother.

323
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:07,583
[HIMEKO]
President!

324
00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:09,708
Great! She's here, too!

325
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:12,375
[HIMEKO growling]

326
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:14,208
Himeko, good morning.

327
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,708
A pleasure as
always, President.

328
00:22:17,916 --> 00:22:19,625
The gang's all here!

329
00:22:19,708 --> 00:22:21,625
--Hey, Harumin.
--Greetings, Taniguchi.

330
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:50,166
[YUZU] Mei and I are
still trying to figure out

331
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:53,125
how to be stepsisters.

332
00:22:53,208 --> 00:22:59,333
I'm not sure what destiny has
in store, but for now...

333
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,083
Yuzu.
