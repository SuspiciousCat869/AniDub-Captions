1
00:01:41,958 --> 00:01:43,958
You seem a little
tired today, Mei.

2
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:45,375
No, I'm fine.

3
00:01:45,458 --> 00:01:46,875
[UME]
If you say so.


4
00:01:46,958 --> 00:01:49,125
I think I'm going to pick up
something for lunch soon.


5
00:01:49,208 --> 00:01:51,000
Is there anything special
you'd like to eat?


6
00:01:51,083 --> 00:01:52,125
Don't be shy.

7
00:01:52,208 --> 00:01:53,708
Remember, we're family!

8
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:57,166
I want you to tell me what
all your favorite foods are.

9
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,833
[YUZU]
Jeez.

10
00:02:02,875 --> 00:02:05,333
[YUZU] Glad she got
some sleep last night.

11
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:08,000
I still can't figure
this girl out.

12
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,625
Yuzu, watch out!

13
00:02:10,708 --> 00:02:11,416
Yuzu!

14
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,583
[YUZU]
Huh?

15
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:15,875
[yells]

16
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:32,333
[sneezes]

17
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:37,458
Hurry up and get in the bath,
before you catch your death!

18
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:38,958
[YUZU]
That's what I'm doing!

19
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:40,833
[UME]
You should get in too, Mei!

20
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:42,041
[YUZU]
Huh?

21
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,916
[YUZU]
Seriously?

22
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:51,625
[YUZU]
I guess we are sisters now.

23
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:55,083
It shouldn't be weird to take
a bath together, should it?

24
00:02:58,041 --> 00:02:59,791
[YUZU]
Her hair's so pretty.

25
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:02,250
And her complexion is perfect.

26
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:05,291
I bet her skin is
like super soft, too.

27
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:07,708
[gasps]

28
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:09,500
[YUZU]
Wait, what am I thinking?

29
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:11,250
Why would I touch her skin?

30
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:15,000
That kiss must've completely
short-circuited my brain!

31
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:18,041
[gasps]

32
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:20,250
Uh, I was just about to get out.

33
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:35,875
Get off!

34
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:39,916
Just stop.

35
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,250
Why even do something like that?

36
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:44,916
Well, the way you
were looking at me

37
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,750
made it clear you
wanted to be touched.

38
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:54,958
[groans]

39
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:57,666
Where does that weirdo
get off, anyway?

40
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,416
Sure, I looked at her.

41
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,208
Why'd she have to jump to
that conclusion, though?

42
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:03,083
Hey, it's Yuzucchi!

43
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:07,291
Y'got bags under
your eyes, girl.

44
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:15,750
Question.

45
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:17,500
[HARUMI]
Huh?

46
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:20,000
I see a lot of couples
at this school.

47
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:23,916
Are they just playing, or are
they like, "together together"?

48
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,625
[HARUMI]
Oh, them? That's typical.

49
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:27,916
Whoa, it is?

50
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,541
Yeah, I mean,
it's not like they plan

51
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:31,458
to stay together
forever or anything.

52
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:33,666
They just wanna have a little
fun while they still can.

53
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,625
Think about it: A lot of these
girls are already engaged.

54
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:38,083
Wouldn't you wanna
fool around some

55
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:39,541
and get that kind
of experimentation

56
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:41,791
out of your system before
you tied the knot, too?

57
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:44,666
We're swimming in a sea
of raging hormones.

58
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:50,500
[YUZU] Okay. Maybe that's
how she feels about me, then.

59
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:51,875
[HARUMI]
I get it.

60
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,791
You have a crush on
somebody, don't you?

61
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:55,333
What, don't be stupid!

62
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:56,416
[HARUMI gasps]

63
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,500
[YUZU]
What's wrong?

64
00:04:57,583 --> 00:05:00,500
[HARUMI]
Ugh, the chairman's here today.

65
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:02,458
And look at the way
you're dressed!

66
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:04,916
He is so gonna murder you!

67
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:11,166
You just stand back and
watch the master, Harumin.

68
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:14,541
That old coot is no match
for the newly elite Yuzu Aihara!

69
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:17,916
[HARUMI] Wow, I bet that sounded
a lot cooler in your-- Wait!

70
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:24,500
Good to see ya, Gramps.
How are you doing today?

71
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:31,416
And who are you? The nerve!

72
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,875
[YUZU]
Damn, that was cold!

73
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:38,083
What disgusting
behavior and clothing.

74
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:40,250
No. Not proper at all.

75
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:42,916
[YUZU]
Uh. Well, the thing is...

76
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,791
[YUZU] Hello? Did he not get
the memo about me and Mom?

77
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:47,791
Look, Mei.

78
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:48,791
Yes, sir.

79
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:50,750
Explain this thing
to me, please.

80
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:53,000
How could you let such
a disrespectful creature

81
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:54,583
disgrace us?

82
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:57,875
I'm terribly sorry, sir.

83
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:59,291
[CHAIRMAN]
I see you've been neglecting

84
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:02,166
your responsibilities
as president.

85
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,583
Now hold the phone!

86
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:05,958
Why would you go and
punish her for this?

87
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:08,291
You should be yelling
at me, Gramps!

88
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:10,166
[CHAIRMAN]
Do not ever, I repeat, ever,

89
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,041
call me by that name again.

90
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:14,166
You clearly don't
belong at this school.

91
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:17,333
Get out of my sight! Go home!

92
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:18,666
[YUZU gasps]

93
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:25,833
Fine. Consider me gone, then.

94
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:27,166
Call me a fool all you want,

95
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,750
but if you're too dumb
to listen to other people,

96
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:31,333
then you're a way
bigger fool than me!

97
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:35,041
[YUZU] You're a big,
mean old stupidhead,

98
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:36,500
and I don't even
want you to be...

99
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:38,958
Who is that
insufferable child?

100
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:40,458
[YUZU]
Your mustache is dumb too!

101
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:46,708
[HARUMI chuckles]

102
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:49,458
I gotta say, Yuzucchi, you
calling the chairman "Gramps"

103
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:51,833
was like the funniest
thing I've seen all year.

104
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:55,000
[YUZU] Yeah, well, I never
said it was a foolproof plan.

105
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:58,875
You sure you wanna sneak in?

106
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:00,208
Yeah, you bet I do!

107
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:03,583
I'm not gonna let some old
windbag boss me around.

108
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:06,541
I might sleep in class,
but I never skip school.

109
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:11,291
That's still the plan.

110
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:13,833
Yep. I know, babe.

111
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:14,666
A teacher.

112
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,291
[AMAMIYA]
Uh-huh. Exactly.

113
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:19,333
I'm telling you, we'll be fine.

114
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:21,250
As soon as I marry the
chairman's granddaughter,

115
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:23,958
money won't be an issue.

116
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:26,458
I just have to play the
part for two more years.

117
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:28,791
After that, I'll be
set for a while.

118
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:31,708
No, don't worry, I'll
still take care of you.

119
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:33,666
I'd better get back
to work though.

120
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:36,041
I love you, too, bye.

121
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:37,625
Uh-oh.

122
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:41,166
Looks like trouble in paradise
for the student council prez.

123
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,458
First the chairman
yells at her, and now,

124
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:45,583
her boyfriend's got
a chick on the side?

125
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,000
Wow!

126
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:48,416
What's wrong?

127
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:52,333
[MEI]
I'm home.

128
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:56,000
Hey, can we talk?

129
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:02,583
[YUZU]
Sorry about today.

130
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:04,000
I was out of line.

131
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:05,583
[MEI]
If you're really sorry,

132
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:08,166
why don't you stop
dressing like a slob?

133
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,500
Really?

134
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:15,750
Uh, well, take my
apology or don't.

135
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:16,958
Anyway.

136
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:18,375
I hate to tell you this,

137
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:21,041
but I heard Mr. Amamiya
talking to somebody else today.

138
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,208
That jerk face doesn't care
about you like at all.

139
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:25,416
He's just taking
advantage of you.

140
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,750
The only reason
he's marrying you

141
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:28,125
is so he can get close to Gramps

142
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:31,166
and take your family's money
for his real girlfriend.

143
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,000
I get that I'm probably
the last person

144
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:35,625
you wanna hear this from,
but that guy is bad news.

145
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:38,708
He's totally using you, and
that's not how love should work!

146
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:41,875
[MEI]
I know. What's your point?

147
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:43,375
I dunno.

148
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:45,416
As your older sister, I think
that's kind of a big deal.

149
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:49,041
I'm just concerned
about you. Sorry.

150
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:51,583
[MEI] You're a child
who's never been kissed.

151
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:53,541
You don't know what
you're talking about.

152
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:54,791
Uh!

153
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:57,291
Hey! Stop acting like
you're better than me!

154
00:08:57,375 --> 00:09:00,666
I'm trying to look out for you
because that's what sisters do!

155
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:12,416
[YUZU] She's making
that sad face again.

156
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:16,166
Almost like she's
in physical pain.

157
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,583
Agh, no fair!

158
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:19,125
Why am I the only
one who has to deal

159
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:20,666
with all these crazy emotions?

160
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,666
I feel like such an idiot!

161
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:32,750
[YUZU]
Look at her.

162
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:35,500
She's really cute
when she's sleeping.

163
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:56,541
No, you can't.

164
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:58,375
Okay, sorry!

165
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:04,958
Wait. Hold on, is she
talking in her sleep?

166
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:08,083
Please, Father. Stay.

167
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:11,458
[gasps]

168
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:17,916
[MINEKO] And above all,
strive for propriety.

169
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,875
[applause]

170
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:22,625
[MARUTA] Inspiring words
from Ms. Mineko Fuji...

171
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:25,041
I wonder where Yuzucchi is at.

172
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,333
No skipping? So much for that.

173
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:28,375
[microphone hums]

174
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:29,458
[MARUTA]
What the--?

175
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:30,666
Hey, you're not
supposed to be up here!

176
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:33,916
Yeah, I know. This'll
only take a second.

177
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,791
What's she doing?

178
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:38,166
[YUZU]
Hey, what's up?

179
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,750
My name's Yuzu Aihara,
and I'm a new first year.

180
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:43,208
Yeah, so, I have a couple of
important announcements

181
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:45,583
I wanna make if that's
okay with everybody.

182
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:47,791
And trust me, I hate
long, boring speeches

183
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:49,500
just as much as the next girl,

184
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:51,625
so, I'll try to make
it quick, okay?

185
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:53,625
First off:

186
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:56,125
Mr. Amamiya made out
with a student,

187
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:57,875
right here at school, too!

188
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:59,541
And the worst part of it is...

189
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:00,791
[gasps]

190
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:03,500
[YUZU] ...he was totally
forcing himself on her!

191
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:05,583
Someone stop that girl;
she shouldn't be up there!

192
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:06,958
[YUZU]
Number two!

193
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,791
I'm the chairman's
granddaughter!

194
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:11,583
Like, I'm kind of a
big deal around here.

195
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:13,583
And mic drop!

196
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:14,750
[chuckles]

197
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:17,375
[STUDENTS chattering]

198
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:21,000
[YUZU groans]

199
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:24,083
I was ready to get
suspended after that,

200
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:26,000
but I got off scot-free.

201
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:27,958
[HARUMI] Yeah, well,
as soon as you told everybody

202
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:29,375
you were the chairman's
granddaughter,

203
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:32,000
there wasn't a whole lot they
could do to punish you.

204
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:34,708
[YUZU]
Uh, if you say so.

205
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:37,625
[YUZU]
I'm home!

206
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:42,625
[YUZU]
Mom?

207
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:49,208
Are you crying? What's wrong?

208
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:53,041
I have bad news.

209
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:54,041
[YUZU]
Huh?

210
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:55,916
It's about Mei.

211
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,250
They came and took
her away from us!

212
00:11:58,333 --> 00:11:59,625
What?

213
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:03,791
[YUZU]
I don't understand.

214
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:05,958
Who do you mean by "they"?

215
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:09,875
Employees of Mr. Aihara.

216
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:14,500
They said they were taking Mei
to live with her grandfather.

217
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:16,458
She didn't argue, either.

218
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:19,166
She just left without
saying a word.

219
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:24,875
[YUZU] I did this.
She's gone because of me.

220
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:28,750
Please don't cry.

221
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:31,666
We'll figure this
out, I promise!

222
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,791
I'll find out how
she feels about it.

223
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:36,875
But if she really wants
to stay with her grandpa,

224
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:39,000
then we're gonna
have to accept that.

225
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:40,500
Okay?

226
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:48,750
[YUZU] I'm not just
doing this for Mom.

227
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:52,083
I also gotta know how Mei
feels about all this.

228
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,416
Yo, President! Have you
got anything to say to me?

229
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:04,416
Not really.

230
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,666
[grunts]

231
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,541
[SCHOOLGIRL A]
Miss President! Good to see you!

232
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:08,833
[SCHOOLGIRL B]
Good morning!

233
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:09,666
[MEI]
Good morning.

234
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:10,750
[SCHOOLGIRL A]
Oh, hey...

235
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:14,250
[YUZU] Wow, she
completely blew me off!

236
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:17,250
[KOBUSHI]
Good morning.

237
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:18,583
In case you ladies hadn't heard,

238
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:20,500
Mr. Amamiya had to
leave the academy

239
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:22,166
due to some personal issues...

240
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:25,916
[YUZU] Okay, I know I'm kinda
responsible for what happened,

241
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
but still, that's no
reason for her to pretend

242
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:29,833
she doesn't even know me.

243
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:31,916
How can she go along with
this like it's nothing

244
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
when she knows how upset
Mom must be about it?

245
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:41,333
[HARUMI]
Earth to Yuzucchi!

246
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:43,500
What's got you feelin'
so depressed, girl?

247
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:45,541
Well, we do have a
big test tomorrow,

248
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:46,666
is that what's buggin' ya?

249
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,291
We're high school
students, Harumin.

250
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:50,166
Tests are just a
part of life for us.

251
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:51,791
True, but I betcha
I got something

252
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:54,291
that's gonna turn that
frown upside-down!

253
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,416
Ta-dah!

254
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,791
You remember that
new store? Check it!

[YUZU groans]

256
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:02,416
Oh, gosh, this is more
serious than I thought.

257
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,958
Sorry, that's cool and all.

258
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:07,916
I mean, I'll still
take 'em, of course.

259
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,125
[HARUMI]
Don't force yourself.

260
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:13,625
[YUZU] Not long ago,
that would've made my day.

261
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:15,583
Maybe I'm turning into
a mindless drone

262
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:18,791
like everyone else
at this school.

[gasps]

264
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:27,166
[YUZU] No way! I'm not
giving up that easy!

265
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,833
[YUZU]
Hey, Aihara!

266
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,500
I'm sorry for that
stunt I pulled.

267
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:41,125
I never imagined
this would happen.

268
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:46,500
Listen, I probably shouldn't
even ask you, but I have to.

What do you really wan--?

Uh. Is something wrong?

271
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:53,916
I have a question.

272
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,708
I just wanna know if
you're gonna rescue me

273
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:58,250
from my mean
grandfather's house.

274
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,875
[MEI]
Just kidding.

275
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:09,458
My grandfather told me to
stop associating with you,

276
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:12,750
so I won't be going back home.

277
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:16,250
And yes, I made that
decision on my own.

278
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:21,166
[MEI]
Just please leave me alone.

279

Gym's not your favorite
subject, I know,

280

but it beats sitting in class
taking a test any day,

don't you agree?

Ease up a little, would ya?

00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,041
[YUZU] It's been a week, and
she still won't talk to me.

284
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:03,208
I wish she wasn't always
surrounded by people.

285
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:09,125
Isn't that girl over there
the one who told everyone

286
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:10,708
she was the
chairman's granddaughter?

287
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:12,333
[SCHOOLGIRL D]
What? Like a love child?

288
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:13,916
[SCHOOLGIRL C]
Probably not.

289
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,208
I bet she made it all up just
to get close to the president.

290
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:18,333
Really? Creepy.

291
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:20,541
[YUZU] With the rumors that
have been flying around lately,

292
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:23,958
I look like some kind
of psycho freak.

293
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:26,541
Meanwhile, she's as
popular as ever.

294
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:28,958
We may be technically
in the same family,

295
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:31,333
but we're a world apart.

296
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:33,958
This sucks.

297
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:35,958
What am I gonna do?

298
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:46,916
[YUZU sighs]

299
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,958
[YUZU]
It's worse at night.

300
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:52,625
That's when all the
feelings I push away

301
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:54,458
while I'm at school
crash back into me

302
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:57,041
like an emotional tidal wave.

303
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:03,208
[YUZU]
Ugh. I really am creepy.

304
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,333
[YUZU]
It's huge!

305
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:29,000
[MEI]
Why are you here?

306
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:31,500
[YUZU]
Oh. I, uh...

307
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,583
Your bag.

308
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:41,333
That's all right.
I'll let myself in.

309

Oh, wow! What a nice house.

310

311
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:48,416
[MEI]
Did you come here just to gawk

312
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,166
at my grandfather's wealth?

313
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:53,458
[YUZU] No, of course not!
I was just looking around.

Um, sorry, but are you sure

316
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:06,041
you're not coming
back to stay with us?

317
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:08,708
[MEI] So, that's what
you came here to say.

318
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:10,666
I gave you an answer
several days ago.

319
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:11,541
My decision is fin--

320
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:13,125
Fine, then explain something.

321
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:16,000
Why do you look so
upset all the time?

322
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:18,083
Like that day you kissed me.

323
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:21,125
Or when I told you the
truth about your fiancée.

324
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:25,375
You always have that same
expression on your face.

325
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:28,375
Do you let everyone see
you sad, or is it just me?

326
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:31,208
And one night, while
you were sleeping,

327
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:34,041
I heard you crying and
calling out for your dad.

328
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:37,541
I just thought, maybe there
was a way I could save you.

329
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:39,208
Those stupid rules
you've made for yourself

330
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:41,333
aren't doing you any favors.

331
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:42,500
You can be free!

332
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:44,458
There's a better way! I swear!

333
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:45,541
[MEI]
Shut up.

334
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:46,833
Look, I know it's
difficult, but I--

335
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:48,375
That's enough!

336
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:00,875
Hey, what...?

337
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:03,791
Stop that!

338
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:21,000
[YUZU]
Don't be scared!

339
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,500
I'm here, right, here!

340
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:34,416
[CHAIRMAN]
What's all the commotion?

341
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,833
Keep it down!

342
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:37,750
[gasps]

343
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:39,916
Uh, I can explain!

344
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:46,916
[CHAIRMAN]
I'm appalled at you.

345
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,250
You've been nothing but trouble

346
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:51,416
from the first moment you
set foot in my school.

347
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:55,375
In fact, from this moment
on, you are expelled!

348
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:56,833
[gasps]

349
00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:58,666
I'll file the paperwork.

350
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,416
Get out. Out I say.

351
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,500
[YUZU]
No, wait! Please!

352
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:03,958
[CHAIRMAN]
Did you hear me? Go.

353
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:08,083
There is no place for deviants
in my academy or my home.

354
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:16,458
That place was awesome.

355
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:18,208
So, where to now?

356
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:19,958
[YUZU sighs]

357
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:23,000
[YUZU] My little sister attacks
me, then I get expelled?

358
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:25,083
What's my life coming to?

359
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:28,250
What's with you today, girl?

360
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:29,875
Come on, we planned
to cut loose.

361
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:31,583
Yeah, that was the plan.

362
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:33,083
But as it turns out,

363
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:35,041
it's kinda hard to cut loose
after you've gotten cut off,

364
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:37,833
if you know what I mean.

365
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:39,041
[HARUMI]
What?

366
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:40,666
So, you really are the
chairman's grandkid,

367
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:44,416
but he expelled you for sticking
up for his other grandkid?

368
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,833
Jeez, talk about a
gigantic load of BS!

369
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:51,000
I had no idea your life
was such a mess, Yuzucchi.

370
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,875
[YUZU] Tell me about it.
What should I do?

371
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:56,000
What did your mom say?

372
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:57,333
[YUZU]
Haven't told her.

373
00:20:57,416 --> 00:20:59,041
Of course not.

374
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:01,458
[YUZU]
I'm so confused, Harumin.

375
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:03,125
I do everything I
can to help her,

376
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:07,291
but it seems like she's more
upset with me every day.

377
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:09,166
All I wanted to do was
to make her happy,

378
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:11,166
but I only ended up
causing her pain.

379
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,625
I'm actually a
terrible big sister.

380
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:15,375
Oh, no, don't say that.

381
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:17,916
The most important thing is
that you did the best you could.

382
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,041
Any girl would appreciate
having an older sister

383
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:23,458
who cares about her and looks
out for her the way you do.

384
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:26,625
Don't worry, I'm sure she
understands how you feel.

385
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,500
How I feel?

386
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:38,458
[YUZU] All this time, what have
I been trying to say to her?

387
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,458
Oh. I see now.

388
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:46,875
[YUZU] The truth is, I've
never felt like this before.

389
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:49,708
I'm beyond clueless about love.

390
00:21:57,333 --> 00:22:01,125
[YUZU] But here love is...
Right in front of me.

391
00:23:32,416 --> 00:23:35,541
[YUZU] I couldn't care less
about what anybody else thinks.

392
00:23:35,625 --> 00:23:37,875
Yes. If you like,
please call me Mei.

393
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:40,458
[YUZU] Why haven't you ever
called me by my first name?

394
00:23:40,541 --> 00:23:41,875
[MEI]
It's simple.

395
00:23:41,958 --> 00:23:44,041
This was the easiest
way to shut you up.


396
00:23:44,125 --> 00:23:46,750
You know, you're terrible.
