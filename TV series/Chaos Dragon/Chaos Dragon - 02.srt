00:00:16,625 --> 00:00:18,000
[SOLDIER 2A]
The legend is true?

2
00:00:18,083 --> 00:00:19,416
[SOLDIER 2B]
Incredible.

3
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,750
[SOLDIER 2C] A Child of
Contract has finally appeared.

4
00:00:26,333 --> 00:00:28,250
Yes, so we must protect him.

5
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:30,166
Until he rises to the throne.

6
00:00:32,708 --> 00:00:35,875
We are the army to
restore freedom to Nil Kamui.

7
00:00:35,958 --> 00:00:39,500
Please, use us as you will,
Child of Contract.

8
00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:41,500
Fugaku...

9
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:44,000
Why did you make me
wear Ryugatou?

10
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:46,708
If you knew Kouran troops
would be at the market,

11
00:00:46,791 --> 00:00:48,250
then that means...

12
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:51,125
Trust me, I didn't know
things would end like this.

13
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:54,208
But still, we needed the heir
to the throne to rise up and--

14
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:55,333
I don't want to be king,

15
00:00:55,416 --> 00:00:57,625
and now Mashiro's
dead because of you!

16
00:00:57,708 --> 00:00:59,416
No, you're
the one who killed her!

17
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,625
This scumbag's
no Child of Contract!

18
00:01:01,708 --> 00:01:04,125
Ibuki... is just a murderer!

19
00:01:04,208 --> 00:01:07,041
He killed my sister, Mashiro!

20
00:01:07,125 --> 00:01:08,416
[IBUKI gasps]

21
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,500
[IBUKI] We hail from a
country known as Nil Kamui.

22
00:01:10,583 --> 00:01:12,750
It is but a small island nation.

23
00:01:12,833 --> 00:01:16,500
We were invaded by the great
ancient country of Kouran.

24
00:01:16,583 --> 00:01:20,083
And in their avarice, a third
of our land was pillaged.

25
00:01:20,166 --> 00:01:22,791
D'natia, an ally state
to the east,

26
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:24,208
was quick to defend settlements

27
00:01:24,291 --> 00:01:27,291
where they had established
bases, but nothing more.

28
00:01:27,375 --> 00:01:29,291
And like a sacrificial swine,

29
00:01:29,375 --> 00:01:31,916
Nil Kamui's land was
carved and slowly devoured

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
by the two infiltrating powers.

31
00:01:34,083 --> 00:01:36,583
Despite all of this,
our guardian deity,

32
00:01:36,666 --> 00:01:39,083
the Red Dragon,
did not protect the land.

33
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:42,291
Imperial Era 3015, September.

34
00:01:42,375 --> 00:01:46,416
When all was said and done,
the country was no longer ours.

35
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:21,250
[PATRONS cheering, chatting]

36
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:28,333
I'm not afraid of a Bounded
One like you, you hear?

37
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:29,875
Back in ancient times,

38
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:33,208
freaks like you weren't even
allowed to speak with humans!

39
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:35,958
Were you acquainted
with Mashiro?

40
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:39,250
Are you saying
that you knew my sister?

41
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:42,916
No. She wasn't
actually my real sister.

42
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,833
But still I...

43
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:47,750
You... liked her?

44
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:51,083
And now she's gone. Why?

45
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,208
[LOU]
My, how marvelous.

46
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:06,666
My Lord, you have the power

47
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,541
to soothe even the
most fearsome creatures.

48
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:11,208
[QI SHA TIAN LING] I thought
this island to be nothing

49
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:13,166
but an insignificant speck.

50
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,916
But it's turned out
to be quite interesting.

51
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,875
[KAI] She was the Child
of Contract's shrine maiden?

52
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:20,250
That's what I heard.

53
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:23,250
But wait, that means
Ibuki was at the castle, too.

54
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:24,375
I don't understand.

55
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:26,125
Why would he kill Mashiro, then?

56
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:28,500
Aren't the shrine maidens
supposed to serve the imperials

57
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:30,666
who came from the line of kings?

58
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:35,250
Mashiro once told me this.

59
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:38,333
[MASHIRO] Long ago, Red Dragon
made a solemn promise.

60
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:41,833
It would lend its blade if
the Child of Contract, the king,

61
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:44,458
made a suitable offering
to it in return.

62
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:48,583
Specifically, a bonded soul.

63
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:50,125
There are a number
of interpretations

64
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:51,833
as to what that means.

65
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,666
But I think it refers
to one who freely gives

66
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,416
everything to the king.

67
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:58,833
You exchange the life
of someone precious to you

68
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:01,166
to save your world from crisis.

69
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:05,125
[chuckles] What an
ingenious scheme that is.

70
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:07,083
[KAI] So because
she was a shrine maiden,

71
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:09,750
Mashiro offered her life
to Ibuki willingly?

72
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,083
Is that it?

73
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:13,208
[EYKHA] And she was eagerly
awaiting the arrival

74
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:14,333
of such a day.

75
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:15,416
But that--

76
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,250
[IBUKI]
That doesn't make it right.

77
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:17,875
[KAI]
Huh?

78
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:18,833
Kai, listen.

79
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:21,250
Red Dragon, he's gone crazy.

80
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:24,541
He's destroyed villages
all over the island.

81
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:26,250
[KAI] Are you trying
to say that's the reason

82
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:27,875
why Mashiro is dead?

83
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:29,000
[IBUKI]
Kai...

84
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:31,125
Is that your excuse now,

85
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:32,875
that you weren't
responsible for killing her

86
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:35,583
because Red Dragon's
gone insane?

87
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:38,708
[FUGAKU]
Lord Ibuki.

88
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:40,250
We must speak.

89
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:44,333
[FUGAKU] While this country went
without a king, the council,

90
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:46,416
or should I say,
the provisional government,

91
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:50,416
along with D'natia
and Kouran, usurped us.

92
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,250
Now is the time to
throw off the shackles

93
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:54,000
and reclaim our land.

94
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:55,791
But I'm not sure if
I've really become

95
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:57,958
a Child of Contract.

96
00:05:58,041 --> 00:05:59,625
[FUGAKU] The abilities
you manifested to defeat

97
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:01,083
that Kouran commander.

98
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:03,750
There's no doubt they were
the power of Red Dragon.

99
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:04,916
We will follow you anywhere,

100
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,541
but we must move
somewhere safer tonight

101
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:08,083
and do so quickly.

102
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,583
Yes, I agree,

103
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:13,291
Kouran reinforcements
should be arriving by daybreak.

104
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:15,250
We must depart immediately.

105
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,125
[SWEALLOW]
Aw, come on now.

106
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:18,416
I just got here.

107
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,000
[HIEN]
Who are you?

108
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:22,958
Me? I'm just
a guy from D'natia.

109
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:25,375
"Just a guy?" Geez.

110
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:26,625
Hey, wait a minute.

111
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:27,833
You're that--

112
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:31,208
[SOLDIER 2A]
D'natia?

113
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:33,500
[SOLDIER 2B] You've got a lot of
nerve coming here, buddy!

114
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:35,666
[FUGAKU]
Sir Black Dragon Knight?

115
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:36,916
Yep, that's who I am,

117
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:41,291
at your service, friend. Hi.

118
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:44,166
[MERYL]
And I am Meryl Sherbet.

119
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,958
I am the official attendant
to Sir Sweallow.

120
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:48,958
The Black Dragon Knights.

121
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:50,875
They're powerful warriors
who have been imbued

122
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:54,583
with the power of Black Dragon,
the guardian deity of D'natia.

123
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:56,708
Out of that nation's force of
three hundred thousand,

124
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:59,208
it's said there are only thirty.

125
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:02,208
But it's hard to
believe he's one of them.

126
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:04,041
You think so? But why?

127
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:05,833
[MERYL] 'Cause you look
and act like an idiot.

128
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:07,250
Sheesh!

129
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:09,166
Why don't you tell me
what you really think, Meryl?

130
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,416
Sir Sweallow,

131
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,458
to what do we owe the
honor of your presence?

132
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:15,125
[SWEALLOW] Oh no,
the honor is all mine, Ibuki.

133
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:17,833
You're next in line
for this country's throne.

134
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:19,916
By the request of
Nil Kamui's council,

135
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,500
we would like to
bring you on as a member

136
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:24,083
of the Red Dragon expedition.

137
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:25,708
At least that's what I heard.

138
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:29,375
Yours truly was selected to be
a member of the expedition, too.

139
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:32,750
There's an expedition...
to find Red Dragon?

140
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:43,166
[SIMEON] I can't believe
you summoned me at this hour.

141
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,666
[KRAMA]
Forgive me, sir. I apologize.

142
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,541
However, I'm not
taking any chances

143
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:49,583
by letting this one out of here.

144
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:55,833
Welcome to my humble,
and I might add, filthy home.

145
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:58,833
[SETSUREN] It looks like
the current rulers

146
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:00,833
of Nil Kamui are here.

147
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:02,916
[SIMEON]
As are you, I see.

148
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,416
[KRAMA]
Agito,

149
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,958
Kouran's forces were attacked
by the revolutionary army.

150
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:09,375
[AGITO]
Ah yes, in town, correct?

151
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:11,458
Are you the one
who gave the orders?

152
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:14,833
Listen. The rumor
of Red Dragon going mad...

153
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:16,708
We have to confirm it.

154
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:19,833
Provoking a skirmish between
forces will cause confusion.

155
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,708
Have you forgotten
about our deal?

156
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:27,000
You know... Kouran. D'natia.

157
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:28,416
And the rebel army.

158
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,708
"Revolutionary" army.

159

[SETSUREN] The three powers

That was our agreement.

[AGITO] That's right,

164
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:43,458

of prodding first,

166
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:46,666
[KRAMA] And to do that
you knowingly sacrificed

It's okay.

We'll just treat this

"An unfortunate accident?"

two forces in conflict
over our conquered land,

211

Well, that's news to me.

And if Kouran has a

Well, we're supposed to
meet them somewhere in town,

we just haven't
run into them yet.

They should be carrying
something like this.

We're not from Kohran.

D'natia and Nil Kamui
have always been allies.

We're all long-term friends.

so make sure this gets through
that thick skull of yours, okay?

D'natia was indeed allied with
this island's royal family,

He was assassinated
during the turmoil with Kouran

during the Seven Year War,
and after that,

Nil Kamui accepted a treaty

00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:32,458
You're brave to
come back to save them.

317
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:34,041
No.

318
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:36,166
You're the one who's brave by
protecting them like this, Kai.

319
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,333
Thank you.

320
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:54,666
Yes! Bite it to pieces! Go!

321
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:57,083
I hold more than
one life, you wretch!

322
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:03,833
[ORPHANS screaming]

323
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:07,250
Eykha!

324
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:09,750
[KOHKAKU laughing]

325
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:10,791
Oh, no!

326
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:12,791
At this rate,
we'll all be killed!

327
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:15,125
We've gotta defeat her somehow.

328
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:21,333
[IBUKI]
I'll have to use that power.

329
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:25,833
[IBUKI]
Answer me! Red Dragon!

330
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,541
Ah, imperial.

331
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:43,166
So you once again desire
the flames that I possess?

332
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,875
[IBUKI] Since the pledge was
already enacted, yes!

333
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:48,083
I have paid your price.

334
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:51,375
Someone... who was
very precious to me!

335
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:52,833
[RED DRAGON]
Indeed.

336
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:55,916
Then summon forth your fire
and strike down my enemy!

337
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,541
[RED DRAGON]
If that is what you desire,

338
00:16:57,625 --> 00:17:00,875
then you must offer me
an equivalent tribute.

339
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,083
[IBUKI]
Wait, but I already did that.

340
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:05,125
You don't mean...

341
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:07,041
[RED DRAGON]
One pledge, one life.

342
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:11,750
That is the cost of each
contract between us, imperial.

343
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:13,375
One pledge, one life?

344
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:15,958
Someone else has to die?

345
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:17,541
I won't let them!

346
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:18,625
Ibuki.

347
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:20,541
This time, it's my turn.

348
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:22,083
Kai, what are you saying?

349
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,708
Red Dragon's
tribute is the soul

350
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:25,625
of someone you're bonded to.

351
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:28,000
Friendship's a bond,
and you and I are friends,

352
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:29,291
so I could...

353
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:31,166
You want...?

354
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,500
Just kill me, Ibuki.

355
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:34,375
Like you did to Mashiro!

356
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:37,458
It's the only way you
can stop that monster!

357
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:38,958
Please, Kai, don't do this!

358
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:40,291
I won't let you!

359
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:42,625
I wasn't able to save Mashiro!

360
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:44,791
No one else dies for me!

361
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:46,000
You're a king, right?

362
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:47,708
Or at least you will be one day!

363
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:50,916
But your subjects there'll
die if you don't kill me!

364
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:53,583
I can't Kai. I won't.

365
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:55,125
Am I not good enough?

366
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:58,208
Will it not work because
we're not friends anymore?

367
00:17:58,291 --> 00:18:00,708
No, Kai.
You are my friend.

368
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,000
[yells]

369
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:06,708
Ibuki!

370
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:08,208
[KOHKAKU] I can't believe
a cute little boy like you

371
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:10,500
is capable of
such terrifying power.

372
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:12,791
Now where is the Dragon Eye?

373
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:14,125
Found it!

374
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,083
Out of my way, runt!

375
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:26,791
No, Kai! Not you!

376
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:29,166
[RED DRAGON]
The pledge has been fulfilled.

377
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,375
But I didn't...!

378
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:33,458
Red Dragon! I wasn't
the one who killed Kai!

379
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:35,291
[QI SHA TIAN LING]
The Child of Contract was unable

380
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:37,125
to defend his friend.

381
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:40,541
In a sense, he abandoned him,
and that is akin to murder.

382
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:42,250
[LOU chuckles]

383
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:44,500
That's the reasoning
of a dragon, I guess.

384
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:45,875
[QI SHA TIAN LING]
Plus a soul that's willing

385
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,541
to lay down its life
is twice as sweet.

386
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:51,541
[LOU]
Indeed, my lord.

387
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:53,666
Oh, thank goodness.

388
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:54,916
[IBUKI]
Kai!

389
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
[KAI]
Red Dragon acknowledged it.

390
00:18:57,083 --> 00:19:00,083
I am still a
precious friend to you.

391
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:04,458
I said a lot of
horrible things to you.

392
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:11,833
Sorry. I was just jealous
of you and Sis Mashiro.

393
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:20,375
[RED DRAGON] You may now
do as you desire, imperial.

394
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:24,166
[IBUKI]
I couldn't protect Kai.

395
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,458
That's the same thing
as killing him.

396
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,916
That's what you're telling me.

397
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,875
Isn't it, Red Dragon?

398
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:34,500
So somehow you've
fused with the Dragon Eye?

399
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:36,458
Steel Form, release!

400
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:39,750
I'll rip the Dragon Eye
and your heart out, boy!

401
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:41,125
Now...

402
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:44,250
I'm going to make you regret
that you were ever born!

403
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,833
[IBUKI, RED DRAGON] By the
oath between the Red Dragon

404
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:15,208
and the Child of Contract...

405
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:17,708
[IBUKI, RED DRAGON]
Perish!

406

[KOHKAKU screaming]

407
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:45,041
[SWEALLOW]
You're sure about this?

408
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:48,041
[IBUKI] Yes. I will
join your expedition.

409
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:50,458
I don't really
have another option.

410
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:55,375
If I stay here, I'll just
lose more people I care about.

411
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:56,541
[MERYL]
Huh?

412
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:57,500
[IBUKI]
Therefore...

413
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:59,333
I have to meet Red Dragon.

414
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:03,166
And when I do,
I'm going to return this power.

415
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:06,041
No, it's not a power,
but a curse!

416
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:10,666
[SWEALLOW]
Got it. Let's go then.

417
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:14,333
[IBUKI] Fugaku.
Take care of the children, okay?

418
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,708
[FUGAKU]
Ibuki!

419
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:31,875
[screaming noise]

420
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,250
Hold on, are you...?

421
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:38,291
Kouran's representative.

422
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:39,625
She must be.

423
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:46,750
[LOU] It's a pleasure
to meet you, Ibuki.

424
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:48,125
You know...

425
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:50,958
I'm hoping that we'll
become the best of friends.

426
00:23:32,791 --> 00:23:34,000
[NARRATOR]
Act Three.

427
00:23:34,083 --> 00:23:35,958
"Three as One."

428
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:37,958
The motive behind the
three countries seeking

429
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:40,458
to find Red Dragon
shrouds Ibuki's life

430
00:23:40,541 --> 00:23:42,416
in both darkness and danger.

431
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:46,208
And now, the final player
takes a seat at the table.
