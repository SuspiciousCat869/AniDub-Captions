1
00:00:14,791 --> 00:00:16,083
[SOL]
Yes, that's correct, sir.

2
00:00:16,166 --> 00:00:19,750
You were right.
I just verified it.

3
00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:22,000
Judging by the armor
and body stature,

4
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:23,791
there's no doubt.

5
00:00:25,666 --> 00:00:27,500
[KA GRAVA] It looks as though
we've been able to confirm

6
00:00:27,583 --> 00:00:31,041
the body of whom we believe
to be Lady Ulrika.

7
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:33,208
[SIMEON]
"Believe to be"?

8
00:00:33,291 --> 00:00:38,333
[KA GRAVA] Hm... Unfortunately,
the head remains missing.

9
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:42,791
There are few on this island
who possess the strength

10
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:45,083
to take down someone
like Lady Ulrika.

11
00:00:45,166 --> 00:00:50,291
Yes, very few. It was likely
the work of Lou Chun Wah.

12
00:00:50,375 --> 00:00:52,125
So, you finally admit it!

13
00:00:52,208 --> 00:00:54,666
All of this deception
was Kouran's doing!

14
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:58,375
Look, I already told you. Lou
was acting on her own accord.

15
00:00:58,458 --> 00:00:59,875
A likely story!

16
00:00:59,958 --> 00:01:02,875
I swear, on my honor, as one
of the Six Greats of Kouran.

17
00:01:02,958 --> 00:01:04,750
I am no liar!

18
00:01:04,833 --> 00:01:07,166
[KA GRAVA] The combined
expedition is finished.

19
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,666
It's been disbanded.

20
00:01:10,875 --> 00:01:13,125
[KA GRAVA ] In truth,
both D'natia and Kouran

21
00:01:13,208 --> 00:01:16,625
sought for the extermination
of Red Dragon.

22
00:01:16,708 --> 00:01:19,166
While the revolutionary
army prepared an alliance

23
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:22,791
with D'natia under
the veil of secrecy.

24
00:01:26,208 --> 00:01:28,083
[KA GRAVA]
Nonetheless, Lady Ulrika

25
00:01:28,166 --> 00:01:31,791
believed in the ideals
of the expedition.

26
00:01:34,875 --> 00:01:37,333
[KA GRAVA] She believed
that Kouran and D'natia

27
00:01:37,416 --> 00:01:39,083
would join hands
and work together

28
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:43,791
to save Nil Kamui's
guardian deity, Red Dragon.

29
00:01:45,625 --> 00:01:47,083
[KA GRAVA]
Thus, as the final member

30
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:51,916
of the combined expedition, I,
Ka Grava Rai Fuu Gramstahl,

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,750
have an obligation to carry
on Lady Ulrika's will.

32
00:01:55,833 --> 00:01:58,583
I swear, I will not
allow any conflict

33
00:01:58,666 --> 00:02:02,500
between Kouran and D'natia
to occur in my presence!

34
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:04,166
[RED DRAGON roars]

35
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:45,125
[MISKA] Her ride is on the
house. Think of it as charity.

36
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:46,708
[SWEALLOW laughs]

37
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:49,125
[MERYL]
Setsuren, what a lovely name.

38
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:50,416
Thanks a lot.

39
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,208
So, you must be the
Sherbet Company person.

40
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:54,750
And that would make
big brother here,

41
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:57,083
the newest member of
the Black Dragon Knights.

42
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:58,500
Is that right?

43
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:00,041
And you?

44
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:03,166
Are you the daughter of some
wealthy merchant or something?

45
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,458
[SETSUREN]
Hm...

46
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:06,833
Sure. Let's go with that.

47
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:08,333
Ok. Ha, ha.

48
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:10,333
That concludes
our introductions.

49
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:13,916
Now then. There's something I
wanted to ask you, Sweallow.

50
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,833
Oh? Sure, what is it?

51
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:18,708
I was curious if you had found
what you were looking for

52
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:21,500
on this remote island.
Have any luck?

53
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:23,500
[MERYL gasps]

54
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:26,375
Well, it's true that I am
here in search of something.

55
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:27,708
But let me ask you,

56
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:30,000
do you happen to know
what that "something" is?

57
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:32,833
No. Not really.

58
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:35,708
But let's see, maybe it's
something that will...

59
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:36,791
never break?

60
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:37,875
[SWEALLOW gasps]

61
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:42,500
[SWEALLOW]
Yes, you're right.

62
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:45,083
No matter what I do, everything
that I try to keep precious

63
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:49,041
to me breaks, shatters
and falls apart.

64
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:53,708
No. It's more like I break
everything, precious or not.

65
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:55,291
How sad.

66
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:58,333
What if there was someone who
could live thousands of years

67
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:01,500
without a change in their
appearance? No aging.

68
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:04,541
Might that be the "something"
big brother was looking for?

69
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:05,666
[gasps]

70
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,000
I may be in a position

71
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:10,500
to give that "something"
to you, Sweallow.

72
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:15,375
[MERYL] What do you mean?
Just who are you?

73
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:16,500
[SWEALLOW]
Uh!

74
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,625
[MISKA]
Hey, everyone!

75
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:28,500
We're about to arrive in
the capital city of Shuka!

76
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:31,208
Interesting.

77
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:34,458
The beast isn't healing its
wounds as quickly as usual.

78
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:38,208
And, in turn, it's taking away
the life to which it's bonded.

79
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:42,291
Must be due to the Magic
Territory shift to D'natia.

80
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,208
Do you have any last words?

81
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:48,000
If I see Ibuki, I can relay any
message you may have for him.

82
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:51,750
I can't die.
Not like this, not yet.

83
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:53,375
Ibuki needs to--

84
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:55,708
He no longer desires
to become king.

85
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:58,208
He plans to help
his sister do so.

86
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:59,916
[EYKHA]
It doesn't matter.

87
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,125
Ibuki is going to be the king.

88
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:04,750
I have decided that
it has to happen.

89
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:06,500
Oh, I see.

90
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:10,208
I suggest you use this.

91
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:13,000
By doing so, the pain in your
body would be neutralized

92
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:15,958
through the use of
Kouran's magic.

93
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:17,541
Just know.

94
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:20,791
This wedge will only be able to
extend your life for a few days.

95
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:23,041
Would you like it?

96
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:30,500
Okay. It's all yours.

97
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:32,791
[gasps]

98
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:50,166
[KA GRAVA]
Tell me. Who is responsible

99
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:53,000
for expediting the
execution of Agito?

100
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:54,541
[KRAMA]
Kouran.

101
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:56,666
It's the condition that we gave
to attend the peace meeting.

102
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,875
[SWEALLOW]
Ka Grava!

103
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:01,083
Leader Simeon!

104
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:03,416
You have some nerve to
show your face here.

105
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,875
Having left without
any warning or notice.

106
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:09,250
Ha, ha. By the way,
will Lady Ulrika

107
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:11,166
be attending the peace meeting?

108
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:14,250
I see. So you
haven't heard yet.

109
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:16,875
We, uh... We've only
heard about Agito.

110
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:18,708
About the execution.

111
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:22,041
[KA GRAVA] Hm... Allow me
to introduce Sir Krama.

112
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:25,666
He's the representative of
the provisional government.

113
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:28,708
[KRAMA]
Sir Sweallow, was it?

114
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:31,125
Agito, who once led
the rebel army,

115
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:33,583
is being held prisoner
here in Shuka.

116
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:35,458
Recently, we discovered
he'd conspired

117
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:38,208
to place a false king named
Inori upon the throne.

118
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:41,458
For doing so, we've decided
to execute him without trial.

119
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:45,375
But, the people of Nil Kamui
support the revolutionary army.

120
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:47,958
[SETSUREN]
Not "revolutionary army."

121
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:51,125
More like "rebel army,"
big sister Meryl.

122
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:54,416
[SWEALLOW]
Setsuren? Sir Byakuei?

123
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,000
If it was that kid Ibuki,

124
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:59,416
I'd let him pro claim himself to
be the king without a problem.

125
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,500
But not Inori. You
know why, right?

126
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:06,250
[BYAKUEI] This is Kouran's
representative, Lady Setsuren.

127
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:07,833
--[SWEALLOW gasps]
--[MERYL] Representative?

128
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:12,041
Indeed. I'm also known as
the spiritual mother, Ling Mu.

129
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:15,166
But why would a leader such
as yourself come here?

130
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,541
[SIMEON]
You there. You know why.

131
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:20,708
Tell me where to
find Lou Chun Wah.

132
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,333
Sir Simeon? What are you--?

133
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:24,041
[SIMEON]
Where is she?!

134
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:37,000
This way. You may speak
directly with Agito in here.

135
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:44,416
What's the meaning
of this. Let me go.

136
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,750
[FUGAKU]
I'm sorry.

137
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:48,958
Agito asked to speak with
Lord Ibuki in private.

138
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:58,375
[BLENHEIM] I am a member of
the Emperor of D'natia's

personal order of cavaliers.
My name is Blenheim.

140
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:05,166
I need to question you
concerning the deaths

141
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:08,375
of Bishop Enumael and
the temple soldiers.

142
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,583
[SWEALLOW] If Agito is
going to be executed,

143
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:17,250
then Inori and Ibuki are most
certainly coming to Shuka.

144
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:18,958
[SETSUREN]
After which they'll summon forth

145
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:20,625
Red Dragon to save him.

146
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:22,125
[KA GRAVA]
Summon?

147
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:25,208
I believe Red Dragon went on
a rampage on its own accord.

148
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:28,083
How unlike you, great merchant.

149
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:32,041
Before it goes on its rampage,
a young girl is always sighted.

150
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:33,250
Or have you forgotten?

151
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:35,541
[KA GRAVA]
And that young girl is Inori?

152
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:38,000
Hey, big brother Sweallow.

153
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:42,166
If Red Dragon appears, would
you mind leaving it alone?

154
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,791
[gasps]

155
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,500
Why would I do that?

156
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:47,000
If we were to just ignore it,

157
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:49,000
this city would be
in a lot of trouble.

158
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:52,041
On the other hand, if big
brother Sweallow kills it,

159
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:55,583
the power of Red Dragon will
be absorbed by Black Dragon.

160
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:59,708
After all, Black Dragon and big
brother are bonded by contract.

161
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:01,958
That's a bit of a
problem for me.

162
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:04,083
I'm sure you understand why.

163
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:07,041
[KA GRAVA] If I recall, your
country once defeated a dragon

164
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:09,958
and built an advanced
civilization with its power.

165
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:10,791
Correct?

166
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:11,833
Why, yes!

167
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:13,500
I believe humans
should be the ones

168
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:15,208
to use the power of dragons.

169
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:16,958
So then, what does
Sir Sweallow get

170
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:19,083
in return for his compliance?

171
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:20,708
Didn't I mention that?

172
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:23,958
I know what big brother
wants, remember?

173
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:24,791
[gasps]

174
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:26,916
Yes. Something everlasting.

175
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,583
Something that
would never break.

176
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:37,708
[SETSUREN] I'm able to remain
in this youthful form

177
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:40,791
until the day I die. And I
can make it the same way

178
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:43,375
for your precious
someone, as well.

179

Change them into an existence
that can't be broken. Yes?

180
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:54,458
[SETSUREN] So how about
it? Why not ask him?

181
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:56,375
Say you want to stay as youthful

182
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:59,708
as you are today forever
to be with him. Okay?

183
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,375
If you do, maybe he'll
actually touch you.

[SWEALLOW]
That's my final answer. Líng Mu.

188
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:14,333
I can honestly say now that
I hold precious the concept

189
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:16,416
of how new things are
born into this world

190

with each thing
that breaks away.

[MERYL gasps]

If you want, whenever you
grow weary of this life,

193
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:24,708
I can try to break you.

[AGITO]
You've grown well, Ibuki.

[AGITO]
Thank you for coming down here.

Hello, Teacher.

Agito.

199
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,000
[AGITO] There is something
you need to do before

200
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:53,000
you can become
king of Nil Kamui.

201
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:56,708
[IBUKI] Wait a minute, I thought
you wanted Inori to become king.

202
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:58,500
[gasps]

203
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:02,000
You must kill Inori...
with your own two hands.

204
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:04,375
That establishes your
right to become king.

are you doing?!

210
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:18,333
This is all part
of Agito's plan.

211
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:19,916
Yes, that's right.

He informed us that very soon
you would come to this prison.

213

Consider it a plea bargain.

214
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:28,666
[INORI]
Agito. Of course, that's right.

215
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,333
Agito went and...

216
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,375
[IBUKI] Inori was cursed by
Red Dragon, just as I was!

217
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:36,500
She went insane because of it!

218
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:39,708
I only want to have Inori
back to how she was before!

219
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:40,750
Killing her is--

220
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:42,500
[AGITO]
You've got it wrong.

221
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:45,708
It was Inori who made
Red Dragon go mad.

222
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:47,375
She what?

223
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:52,208
Half a year ago, Inori was
hiding in a certain village.

224
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:55,083
But they discovered who
she was, and, in fear

225
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:58,791
of being chased by Kouran, the
villagers tried to kill her.

00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:26,291
[RED DRAGON roars]

231
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:29,125

[INORI laughs]

234
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:37,625
[AGITO]
By the time we arrived,

235
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:40,250
Red Dragon was in the middle
of burning down the village

236
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:42,291
by Inori's command.

237
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:47,041
[AGITO] It was then that
I knew she had gone mad.

238
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:56,375
Red Dragon?

239
00:13:56,458 --> 00:14:00,333
Agito! How could you?!

240
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:02,625
You killed Father and Mother?!

241
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,541
So you finally remembered!

242
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:07,208
The death of your parents,
the King and Queen.

243
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:09,333
The tragedy that took
place three years ago

244
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:11,500
wasn't because of Kouran.

245
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:12,833
I killed them!

246
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:14,416
Uh?!

247
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,000
[AGITO] The king was secretly
planning to gain a false form

248
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:20,958
of peace by offering Nil
Kamui to D'natia and Kouran.

249
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:23,541
That is not the kind
of country I desire!

250
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:26,333
That's why I killed the king!

251
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:28,916
Agito, no. It can't be...

252
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,333
[AGITO] But when I met
Inori at that village,

253
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:33,125
she smiled back at me.

254
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:35,583
The memory of what I
had done was gone.

255
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,000
That's when I knew.

256
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:39,500
She wasn't the same as
she had been before.

257
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:41,625
Don't worry, I won't
forget again.

258
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:43,958
Now, Red Dragon. Kill Agito!

Dragon has approved of me.

But forget that.

I heard that our Ling

Yeah. She told me to
leave Red Dragon alone.

I assume you're not
going to listen. Pity.

Honestly, I don't care who
defeats Red Dragon.

As long as, in the end,

[LOU growls]

315
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:35,083
Contract seal. Now release.

[BLACK DRAGON growls]

317
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:40,916
[QI SHA TIAN LING]
It came. It finally arrived.

318
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,833
[KRAMA]
What the...?

319
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:43,875
What's going on?

320
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:54,041
[IBUKI]
Inori. What have you done?

321
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:57,708
[INORI] Today's going to be the
first day of our independence!

322
00:17:57,791 --> 00:18:00,666
And very soon you and
I will bond as one!

323
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:01,791
Uh!

324
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:03,166
What are you talking about?

325
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,250
A king can do anything
they want, right?

326
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:06,625
Or have you forgotten?

327
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:10,083
[groaning]

328
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:11,583
[KA GRAVA]
I see.

329
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:15,750
So my old friend is being
controlled by Inori after all.

330
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:18,541
[RED DRAGON roars]

331
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:20,583
[SIMEON] I will release
the contract seal!

332
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:23,333
All those who are still
alive, leave at once!

333
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:26,166
And after all that talk
about making me king.

334
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,541
You're such a liar, D'natia!

335
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:30,750
Contract seal, now release!

336
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:34,083
Black Blade!

337
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,125
Is that all you've got?

338
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:39,125
Wow, how incredibly lame.

339
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:40,333
[IBUKI]
Careful, Simeon!

340
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:42,000
[RED DRAGON roars]

341
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:45,625
Heh. I'm the one to
defeat Red Dragon.

342
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:46,875
[gasps]

343
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:50,166
[SIMEON]
Black Dragon! I beseech you!

344
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,583
Grant me your two
divine protections!

345
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:55,125
Wait he has two contract seals?

[SIMEON growls, yells]

Hear me, Black Dragon!

[SIMEON growls]

349
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,166
Come, Dear Brother.

350
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:22,000
[IBUKI]
Do I really have to kill her?

351
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:25,166
Red Dragon. Answer me!

352
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:28,166
[IBUKI]
It won't say anything!

353
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,333
[INORI]
Don't worry.

354

[gasps]

355
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:33,291
Red Dragon is right
here with me.

00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:37,083
[EYKHA]
Ibuki!

00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:39,416
Eykha!

358
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,000
You don't have to dirty
your hands with this one,

359
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:44,250
because I'm your sword.
And I will strike!

360
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:45,375
[INORI groaning]

361
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:46,583
Eykha, no!

362
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:49,541
You're not my sword,
understand me? Listen.

363
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:52,166
You're the one I
care for the most!

[sighs]

368
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:04,166
[INORI] Did you forget?
Red Dragon is inside me.

369
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:07,083
Neither I nor Red Dragon
can be destroyed.

370
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:09,250
We're invincible.

listen to my song.

[KA GRAVA]
The Song of a Bonded One.

374
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:21,083
A magic that changes their life
force into their attack power.

375
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:23,291
So, she's prepared
to die then.

376
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:24,958
To give her life.

Come forth, Red Dragon! Ha!

380
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:15,250
Red Dragon won't give up.

381
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:17,333
It'll just keep reviving her.

382
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:19,875
[KA GRAVA]
So long as Inori still lives.

383
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:21,791
But no attacks will
be able to reach her

384
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:24,333
because of Red Dragon's
divine protection.

385
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:27,416
[laughs] Well, this
isn't looking too good.

386
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:31,375
My lord. I'll bring down
Red Dragon for you.

387
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:36,125
And now, I want you
to use my life....

[IBUKI]
Something's changed.

390
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:44,541
I can't hear Red Dragon's
voice anymore. But...

Imperial Era 3015, November.

392
00:21:48,666 --> 00:21:51,208
I've... decided.

[NARRATOR]
Act Twelve.

One Chance in a Million.

395

The city of Shuka burns,
consuming all with it.

Fulfill your desire,
Imperial! Meet with destiny!
