1
00:00:13,708 --> 00:00:16,416
You want to be... my friend?

2
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,666
I do.

3
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,625
You may call me Lou Chun Wah.

4
00:00:19,708 --> 00:00:21,750
A pleasure, yes?

5
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:23,583
Sure it is.

6
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:25,166
And your name's Ibuki?

7
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:28,416
I believe you're also a member
of the Red Dragon expedition.

8
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,625
[SWEALLOW]
Now I get it. Hi there.

9
00:00:30,708 --> 00:00:33,708
So I guess you must be the
missing member of our party.

10
00:00:39,458 --> 00:00:41,791
[IBUKI] We hail from a
country known as Nil Kamui.

11
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:44,083
It is but a small island nation.

12
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:47,541
We were invaded by the great
ancient country of Kouran.

13
00:00:47,625 --> 00:00:52,000
And in their avarice, a third
of our land was pillaged.

14
00:00:52,083 --> 00:00:54,625
D'natia, an ally
state to the east,

15
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:56,041
was quick to defend settlements

16
00:00:56,125 --> 00:00:59,041
where they had established
bases, but nothing more.

17
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:01,625
And like a sacrificial swine,
Nil Kamui's land

18
00:01:01,708 --> 00:01:05,958
was carved and slowly devoured
by the two infiltrating powers.

19
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:08,541
Despite all of this,
our guardian deity,

20
00:01:08,625 --> 00:01:11,833
the Red Dragon,
did not protect the land.

21
00:01:11,916 --> 00:01:15,083
Imperial Era 3015, September.

22
00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:19,125
When all was said and done,
the country was no longer ours.

23
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:54,708
[SWEALLOW]
All right!

24
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:55,875
Now that we're all here,

25
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:58,625
it's time to begin
the combined expedition!

26
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:01,208
Tomorrow, we'll be packing
up and leaving Shuka.

27
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:03,666
We'll then be traveling to
the independent city of Haiga,

28
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,500
where there's a guy
who knows the Red Dragon!

29
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:07,875
Did I get all that right?

30
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:09,708
Surprisingly, you did.

31
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:11,625
I was expecting you
to forget most of it.

32
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:13,333
[SWEALLOW]
Well, my mind is pretty sharp.

33
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:15,125
Now. Who's hungry?

34
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:17,000
If we're going to be spending
a lot of time together,

35
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:18,500
we should all get
to know each other!

36
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:19,916
And what better way to open up

37
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,583
than grabbing a hot meal
before going on an adventure?

38
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:23,875
I'm sorry.

39
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:25,750
There's something
that requires my attention.

40
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:28,583
But please feel free
to go into town without me.

41
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:34,750
We must also refuse.

42
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:36,041
I don't think it
would be appropriate

43
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:38,083
for us to act
so informally yet.

44
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:39,750
If you'll excuse us.

45
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:49,666
I'd be more than happy
to join you for dinner.

46
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,250
[SWEALLOW chuckles]

47
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:52,625
I guess that
worked in your favor.

48
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:54,625
You must be so thrilled.

49
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:55,791
Meryl, it's not like I'm trying

50
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:57,541
to get to know her
personally or anything.

51
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:58,791
It's for the good
of the mission.

52
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:01,000
[laughs]
You understand, right?

53
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:03,166
Oh, yes, absolutely.

54
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,625
[SWEALLOW] And what'd be
extra good for the mission

55
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:05,958
is you digging
into her background

56
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:07,916
while I keep her entertained.

57
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:14,083
[sighs]
Fine. I'll see what I can do.

58
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:14,916
Good luck.

59
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,500
[SWEALLOW]
One more thing.

60
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:24,833
Could you maybe
lend me some money,

61
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:26,708
so I'll be able to pay?

62
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,041
[MERYL]
Enjoy your time out on the town.

63
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:38,625
[IBUKI]
Mashiro and Kai.

64
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:40,958
Please rest in peace.

65
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:43,583
Fugaku has gone
to report to Agito.

66
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:44,875
Agito?

67
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:47,166
The leader of
the revolutionary army.

68
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,458
And I have been
appointed your escort.

69
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:51,625
Wait. There's a whole army?

70
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:01,458
[SWEALLOW]
Can I ask you something?

71
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:02,958
It's about that big box.

72
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:05,416
It looks really important,
so what is it?

73
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,708
Your weapon?

74
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:09,666
[LOU]
Not exactly.

75
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,458
It's so much more than that.

76
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:13,791
The object inside
is my very life.

77
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:15,833
It transcends weaponry.

78
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:18,666
Guess that means it's something
you can't use carelessly.

79
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:22,083
So it must be an heirloom
or a keepsake then, right?

80
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:28,458
Why is what's in my
box of such interest to you?

81
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:29,833
Oh, it's not!

82
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:31,750
[chuckles]

83
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:38,041
See...
The thing about me is,

84
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:40,708
I can never keep a tool
or a weapon for very long.

85
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:43,833
When I use an item
like that, sometimes...

86
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,958
Okay. Just about every time,
the thing falls apart

87
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:52,833
as soon as I'm done using it.

88
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:55,083
Yes, I see that.

89
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:56,833
I've never gotten
sentimental about an item

90
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:58,583
in my entire life.

91
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:00,000
I guess that's
why I was so intrigued

92
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:01,500
by the way you
talk about that thing.

93
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:03,500
It's a foreign concept to me.

94
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:09,083
Sorry if I was being too nosy.

95
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:12,916
People don't always choose
which tools they get to use.

96
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:16,666
The tools are the ones
who choose their users.

97
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,000
[SWEALLOW]
Wait, so...

98
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:20,583
Are you trying to tell me
your weapon chose you?

99
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:24,791
[LOU] Why does that notion
seem to surprise you so?

100
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:26,500
Have you never been chosen?

101
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:29,791
That would suggest items
don't like you very much.

102
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:35,541
[WHISPERING, CRYING]

103
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,916
[SWEALLOW] I never
thought about it like that.

104
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,250
Wow. Huh.

105
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:52,083
[EYKHA] So you're the one
who runs this store, Meryl?

106
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:53,333
[MERYL]
Yes.

107
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:54,791
It's actually a branch
of the Sherbet Company,

108
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:56,791
but I'm the one who manages it.

109
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,500
Wait, how can that be
when you're so busy

110
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,083
attending to Sweallow?

111
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:03,041
It's not really
that complicated.

112
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:04,791
Actually, it's simple.

113
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:07,125
You see, I maintain
Sir Sweallow's assets.

114
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:09,541
To keep him from
going bankrupt again.

115
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:16,291
Done!

116
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:17,708
I'll have the rest of the
luggage couriered for us.

117
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:19,666
Let's grab a bite
before we head back, okay?

118
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,416
That's a good idea--

119
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:24,958
I'm sorry. I can't.

120
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:26,916
I'll return to
the inn on my own.

121

[DRUNK 3A]
Well, it's like I always say:

Better let it go.

Still...

at least thrown her

132

in a pen or something!

133
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,000
[trumpets]

134
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:09,625
What a cry!

135
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:11,416
Are we really
riding those things?

Yes, we are.

How about that!

We'll be traveling in style
on those Gadanans!

139

Right, Ibuki?

140
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:20,958
I suppose so.

141
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:23,041
What was that?

142
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:25,083
I mean...
Was it something I said?

143
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:26,500
Perhaps he's not as excited

144
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:29,000
about joining the
expedition as you are.

145
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:32,791
No one's forcing him to go.
he joined of his own volition.

146
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:35,208
But never mind that,
where are we going again?

147
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:37,666
Have you already forgotten
what you said yesterday?

148
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,125
Well, I said a lot
of things yesterday!

149
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:50,291
[MERYL] Right now,
we're here in the town of Shuka.

150
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:51,375
As you should know,

151
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:53,916
our destination
is Haiga to the south.

152
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,416
It's a neutral city and
said to be the home of someone

153
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,916
who knows the
Red Dragon personally.

154
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,625
This someone is Ka Grava,

155
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:03,291
more commonly known as
"the Undead Merchant."

156
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,208
As it happens,
Ka Grava owns Haiga.

157
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:08,750
And if that's not enough,

158
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:11,041
ercent
he supposedly owns five
of the world's total capital

159
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:12,458
on top of that.

Any information he has
could be vital to our cause.

Sure. You can count on me.

[FUGAKU] Aren't you
the least bit concerned

00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:41,125
that joining forces
with Kouran and D'natia

169
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:43,125

Which works in our favor,

drawn to the Red Dragon.

00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:14,416
We'd better figure out something

318
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,041
before D'natia decides to get
involved, or we are so screwed.

319
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:18,625
[FEMALE ADJUTANT 3B]
There aren't a lot of options.

320
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:20,416
We have to take Haiga
before then.

321
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,583
[GAKUSHO]
Yeah.

322
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:24,000
If only because
there's a debt to be paid!

323
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:26,875
That merchant won't
be "undead" much longer.

324
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:31,916
They've been completely
surrounded as far as I can see.

325
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:32,750
How come?

326
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:34,416
I thought Haiga was neutral.

327
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,000
Yes, but the
intel I've procured

328
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:38,166
seems to suggest that
they've been secretly funding

329
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,875
the revolutionary army.

330
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:41,541
That's not the worst of it.

331
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:42,958
I have information.

332
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:45,333
Apparently D'natia forces
are on their way here

333
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:47,833
led by Lady Ulrika,
and once they arrive,

334
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:49,750
the city will
become a battlefield.

335
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:52,041
It's only a matter of time.

336
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:54,083
And our country's desire
to keep up appearances

337
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,375
won't help any.

338
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:56,916
[MERYL]
I'm not done.

339
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,458
According to the map,

340
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:00,791
the Undead Merchant's manor
is located near the coastline.

341
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:03,291
So it's fortified
by natural defense.

342
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:04,958
[SWEALLOW] Which means we'll
need one heck of a plan

343
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:06,750
to stand a chance
of getting inside.

344
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:08,083
We can wait for the conflict

345
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:10,541
between D'natia and
Kouran's forces to flare up,

346
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:12,666
and in the chaos,
make our way into the city.

347
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:15,000
How about a little
less death and destruction?

348
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:16,833
Then I suggest we
use our company ties

349
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:19,416
to negotiate our way through
the business structure.

350
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,875
If that were an option,

351
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:23,416
Kouran would have resolved
its issue peacefully by now.

352
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,333
Okay. Fine. Infiltration.

353
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:29,333
Just leave everything to me.
I'll take care of it.

354
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:30,875
[IBUKI]
Wait!

355
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:33,750
I know I might slow you down,
but please take me with you.

356
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:35,291
You want to go?

357
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:36,875
I do!

358
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:40,041
The Undead Merchant is said to
be a close friend to Red Dragon.

359
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:42,166
And since I'm an imperial
tied to the Dragon,

360
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,875
he'll listen to me.
He has to!

361
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:47,000
All right.

362
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:49,083
You can come with me this time.

363
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:52,083
After all, what kind
of friend would I be

364
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:53,708
if I didn't let you try?

365
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:55,916
We're really more
like acquaintances...

366
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,291
[LOU chuckles]

367
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:03,250
[IBUKI] I have to meet Red
Dragon as soon as possible.

368
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:05,041
It's my only hope
of preventing others

369
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:07,541
from being dragged
into this misery.

370
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:11,500
--[LOU] Here.
--[IBUKI] What are you doing?

371
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:13,458
--Ready?
--Oh, no!

372
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:18,625
Please put me down,
I can do it myself!

373
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:20,291
I beg you! Lou!

374
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:21,541
You should calm down.

375
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:23,333
You'll bite your tongue off.

376
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:49,958
This place...

377
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:51,750
[LOU]
It is quite unique.

378
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:55,625
I believe it is intended to be
the lord of the manor's study.

379
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:57,500
This is very strange.

380
00:20:57,583 --> 00:21:00,500
It doesn't feel as if
anyone lives here at all.

381
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:04,666
[IBUKI]
Uh, hey, Lou?

382
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,208
Did you see something
moving over there?

383
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:08,000
[LOU]
Not that I noticed.

384
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:14,375
Look, there!

385
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:15,500
[LOU]
Oh?

386
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:18,000
[IBUKI]
I thought I saw...

387
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:19,416
Now, Ibuki.

388
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,250
You should know better
than to play tricks on adults.

389
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,166
[IBUKI yells]

390
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:33,166
[VOICE] Good morning,
I don't believe we have met.

391
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:36,500
I am Ka Grava Rai Fuu Gramstahl.

392
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:39,250
So he's the one.

393
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:41,708
You're the Undead Merchant?

394
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:45,125
[KA GRAVA]
Yes. That I am.

395
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:49,125
How would you like
to join me for breakfast?

396
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:51,958
Doesn't that sound pleasant?

397
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:35,541
[NARRATOR]
Act four. "Amid Enemies."

398
00:23:35,625 --> 00:23:38,708
Haiga is on the brink
of being consumed by warfare.

399
00:23:38,791 --> 00:23:40,166
But despite his anguish,

400
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:42,833
Ibuki must once again make
a choice for life or death.

401
00:23:42,916 --> 00:23:44,083
Who can he save,

402
00:23:44,166 --> 00:23:46,416
and what measures must he take
to protect them?
