00:00:07,666 --> 00:00:08,750
[IBUKI yells]

2
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:16,458
[VOICE] Good morning,
I don't believe we have met.

3
00:00:16,541 --> 00:00:19,666
I am Ka Grava Rai Fuu Gramstahl.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,541
So he's the one.

5
00:00:22,625 --> 00:00:25,041
You're the Undead Merchant?

6
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:28,375
[KA GRAVA]
Yes. That I am.

7
00:00:28,458 --> 00:00:32,416
How would you like to
join me for breakfast?

8
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,791
Doesn't that sound pleasant?

9
00:00:36,208 --> 00:00:37,666
[LOU] Could you
keep it down, please?

10
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:40,166
You're giving me a headache.

11
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:41,625
Even with your Wu Xing Ti,

12
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:44,625
my fists are capable of
destroying you from the inside.

13
00:00:44,708 --> 00:00:46,666
[IBUKI]
W-Wait a second! Please!

14
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:50,166
We're here to speak with you
about Red Dragon.

15
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,541
[IBUKI] We hail from a country
known as Nil Kamui.

16
00:00:52,625 --> 00:00:55,208
It is but a small island nation.

17
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:58,791
We were invaded by the great
ancient country of Kouran.

18
00:00:58,875 --> 00:01:03,375
And in their avarice, a third
of our land was pillaged.

19
00:01:03,458 --> 00:01:06,000
D'natia, an ally state
to the east,

20
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:07,416
was quick to defend settlements

21
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,500
where they had established
bases, but nothing more.

22
00:01:10,583 --> 00:01:13,750
And like a sacrificial swine,
Nil Kamui's land was carved

23
00:01:13,833 --> 00:01:17,541
and slowly devoured by
the two infiltrating powers.

24
00:01:17,625 --> 00:01:20,166
Despite all of this,
our guardian deity,

25
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:23,666
the Red Dragon,
did not protect the land.

26
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,875
Imperial Era 3015, September.

27
00:01:26,958 --> 00:01:30,750
When all was said and done,
the country was no longer ours.

28
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:09,291
And who might you be?

29
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:10,958
Huh? Oh, come now.

30
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:12,791
Can't you at least
make an educated guess?

31
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:13,791
Hi, there!

32
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:15,583
My name is Shaddy,
and this is Sol!

33
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:17,083
Nice to meet you!

34
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:20,833
We were sent here to greet you
by order of Lord Ka Grava.

35
00:03:20,916 --> 00:03:23,583
So are you both
Bounded Ones?

36
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:25,041
Well, Shaddy is.

37
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:27,750
Sol is a
human-monster half-breed.

38
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,708
He's a mixed one.

39
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:31,833
[EYKHA] The Undead Merchant
sends a Bounded One

40
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:33,541
and a Mixed One
as his messengers?

41
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:34,625
[SHADDY]
Yep!

42
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:36,500
Lord Ka Grava
treats everyone equally,

43
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:38,500
without judgment
or discrimination.

44
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:39,791
[SWEALLOW]
Is that so...

45
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:41,791
Enough with all this
prattling chit-chat.

46
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:43,333
The Kouran forces
surrounding the city

47
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:44,666
could find us
at any moment.

48
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,958
We need to get moving.

49
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:49,750
Uh... sorry about him.
He's always like this.

50
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:52,291
Right then. Let's head
to the city, shall we?

51
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:53,583
Sounds good to me.

52
00:03:56,416 --> 00:04:00,000
[FEMALE ADJUTANT B] I apologize
for the intrusion, Miss.

53
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:01,208
I hope you have
a really good reason

54
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:02,958
for disturbing
my slumber like this.

55
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:04,083
What's going on?

56
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:05,708
[FEMALE ADJUTANT B]
Well... you see...

57
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:07,791
Ka Grava...

58
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:09,000
[GAKUSHO]
Was asleep?!

59
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:10,791
[FEMALE ADJUTANT B]
Yes, ma'am! Take a look.

60
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:16,333
[CROWD cheering]

61
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:22,208
[GAKUSHO] You mean to say
that during the one month

62
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:23,708
we surrounded him...

63
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:26,875
That tin can was actually
just sleeping the whole time?!

64
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:31,875
[CROWD cheering]

65
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:42,666
[KA GRAVA]
Ta-da!

66
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:57,000
[SHADDY]
Lord Ka Grava!

67
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:59,250
Our guests have arrived!

68
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:00,583
[KA GRAVA]
Oh!

69
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:03,291
So you're members of the
combined expedition, yes?

70
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:05,708
Welcome! Climb aboard!

71
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:07,958
We can have a
nice chat at my manor!

72
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:13,666
[GAKUSHO] So you finally
show up, do you.

73
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,458
Today is the day
I take my vengeance.

74
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:18,916
Nobody makes a fool of me!

75
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:26,166
[whirring noise]

76
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,500
[CROWD screaming]

77
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:29,583
I did it!

78
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:32,166
I killed Ka Grava,
once and for all!

79
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,208
Now to march in
and crush Haiga by force!

80
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:36,708
We must act quickly
before D'natia intervenes!

81
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:37,791
[FEMALE ADJUTANT 3B]
Right!

82
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:47,125
[MACHINE beeps]

83
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:54,041
Just look at what
they've done to you.

84
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:56,375
That overhaul
took an entire month!

85
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:01,166
[SOL]
Lend a hand, Shaddy.

86
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,708
[SHADDY]
Alley-oop!

87
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:09,833
[KA GRAVA]
Yes, much better!

88
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:11,166
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

89
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,916
I must say,
Gakusho has quite a taste

90
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,333
for aiming at my
most costly part!

91
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:16,375
Wait, Gakusho?

92
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:18,000
As in the Kouran general?

93
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:19,250
[KA GRAVA]
The very same!

94
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:21,291
She was hailed as
being a master sniper

95
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:23,208
during the Seven-Year War.

96
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:25,541
Despite my selling her
guns and gunpowder,

97
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:28,416
she seems to have quite
the grudge against me.

98
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:31,916
There's no sense
in having all these guns

99
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,083
if we don't have the gunpowder
to actually use them!

100
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:35,666
The price of
gunpowder keeps rising,

101
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:38,500
not only in Nil Kamui,
but our country, as well!

102
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:40,333
I've no doubt Ka Grava
is behind it.

103
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:41,625
He's cornering the market!

104
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:43,000
That sneaky bastard!

105
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:44,666
He sold us the weapons
for dirt cheap

106
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,625
knowing that he'd bleed us
dry for the gunpowder!

107
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:48,833
[crashing noise]

108
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:51,250
Retreat! Move!

109
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:52,375
[FEMALE ADJUTANT 3B]
Yes, ma'am!

110
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:55,416
That tin can will
pay dearly for this.

111
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,916
[KA GRAVA chuckles]

112
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,375
[MERYL] She believes
you're supplying funds

113
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:00,000
to the revolutionary army.

114
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:03,166
Kouran's forces will lay siege
to this city because of it.

115
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,083
[KA GRAVA]
Hm...

116
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:05,833
Keeping Haiga's neutral position

117
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:09,416
is going to be difficult
in this situation.

118
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:13,000
This is the current image
of Haiga's main gate.

119
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:14,833
[LOU] Looks like the
pride of their military,

120
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:17,166
the steam tank brigade
is in position.

121
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,958
They aren't fooling around.

122
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:21,208
[KA GRAVA] Yes. Knowing
that D'natia is closing in,

123
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:24,250
it would appear that they're
going on the offensive.

124
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:25,791
Oh, I know!

125
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:29,166
Once the battle begins,
we can draw D'natia's forces in.

126
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,375
Confusion will arise
among both sides.

127
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:33,250
When it does,
we'll seize that opportunity

128
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:35,458
and assassinate
both their leaders!

129
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:36,375
[LOU chuckles]

130
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:38,125
Wow. Isn't that kinda...?

131
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,750
I feel the simplest approach
is the best approach here.

132
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:42,000
No! Wait!

133
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:43,416
We need to find a way
to prevent all of this

134
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,125
without hurting anyone!

135
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:46,625
For example...?

136
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:48,625
[IBUKI] Well, why not
try speaking with them

137
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:50,083
one more time?

138
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:51,333
Come on, Ibuki.

139
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:52,958
It's a little too late for that,
don't you think?

140
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:54,458
[LOU]
Not at all!

141
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:56,791
I agree!
I think it's a fine idea!

142
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:58,625
I'm sure we can
get them to listen!

143
00:07:58,708 --> 00:07:59,625
[KA GRAVA]
Hm...

144
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:01,458
Well, how about
this then, Ibuki?

145
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:05,041
If you're able to avoid this
conflict through negotiation,

146
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:06,958
then I will acknowledge
you as being worthy

147
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:09,125
to hear the message
from Red Dragon.

148
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,625
Hello, Ka Grava?

149
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:18,125
You're still there, aren't you?

150
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:19,416
[KA GRAVA]
Oh! Lou!

151
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,625
What can I do for you?

152
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,166
[LOU] I hope you'll
forgive the intrusion,

153
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:25,041
but I have some information
on Ibuki to share.

154
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:26,125
[KA GRAVA]
Oh?

155
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:27,583
He holds strange
and mysterious powers

156
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:29,708
as a Child of Contract.

157
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:30,875
Yes.

158
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:32,291
I know for a fact
that he has the power

159
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:33,625
to kill anyone in front of him

160

Intriguing.

That's a harsh way
to negotiate, though.

is still for him to decide.

Oh, I won't hear of it!

[IBUKI]
Apology?

[KA GRAVA] Yes, an apology
for the one month

this letter of apology,

read it and hear you out.

He sold us the weapons cheap
just to bleed us dry!

319
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:29,791
[KA GRAVA] It's my letter
of apology to Gakusho.

320
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:32,333
All right, that's
enough of this farce.

321
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:35,125
[IBUKI]
I see!

322
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:37,791
She thinks Ka Grava died
when she shot him.

323
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:42,375
So if I let her know that
he's actually still alive,

324
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:44,791
it may lead me
to another choice!

325
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:49,166
General Gakusho!

326
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,958
Please! I beseech you!

327
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:52,791
Take a moment
to read that letter!

328
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:55,333
It was written recently
by Ka Grava himself!

329
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:57,250
Ka Grava is still alive!

330
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:58,666
He what?!

331
00:15:58,750 --> 00:15:59,625
[GAKUSHO]
No way...

332
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:00,708
Even if he's some machine,

333
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:02,625
I put a bullet
right through his head!

334
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:03,833
Wait...

335
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:06,250
Maybe he is undead,
like his name implies.

336
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:07,791
[IBUKI]
It would only take a moment!

337

Please, if you want
to save yourself,

and listen to me!

What now?

340
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:14,583
If Ka Grava is alive,

341
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:16,958
there may still be room
for negotiation.

[IBUKI] After she reads
the letter, then what?

344
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:22,041
What's to negotiate?

345
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:25,583
If it doesn't work, I'll end up
killing Eykha and Gakusho!

346
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,958

No use conducting a war
after seeing this.

Uh, so then...
You accept his apology?

355
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:49,875
Apology?

356
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:51,125
[laughs]

357
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:53,125
He sent us a peace treaty!

358
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:56,291
And I've got no complaints with
the conditions he's offered.

Send a message to our forces!

Haiga has accepted
all of our demands!

362
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,958
From this point forward,
we will enter Haiga

363
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:15,291
as an occupation force!

[LOU] Ka Grava.
He must have set up something.

368
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:27,791
[IBUKI]
During my sleep...

369
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:29,291
[KA GRAVA]
No, during my overhaul,

370
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:31,583
an unfortunate misunderstanding
has occurred.

371
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:33,708
For that, I apologize.

372
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:35,541
It was definitely
not my intention

373
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:37,500
to dismiss your advancement.

374
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:39,333
Regrettably,
the government of Haiga

375
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:42,125
will stop any further
resistance and accept abidance

376
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:44,750
under the rules
of Kouran's security.

377
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:47,541
Along with the costs involved
with being stationed here,

378
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:50,083
I will provide concessions
as expected.

379
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:53,625
I look forward to your
sound and right decision.

[IBUKI]
"Being stationed"?

381
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:56,500
[GAKUSHO]
That's right.

382
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:58,041
I don't mind fighting
for a good cause,

383
00:17:58,125 --> 00:18:00,833
but killing and plundering
isn't really my thing.

384
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:05,375
I admit, I do have a personal
grudge against Ka Grava.

385
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:08,666
But... For now,
I'll forget about all that.

386
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,208
Oh, good.

387
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:12,541
Well, if you'll excuse us.

388
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:13,791
[GAKUSHO]
Just a moment, Ibuki.

389
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:15,375
[IBUKI]
Huh?

390
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:16,750
At least I know now

391
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:19,333
that you're not like all the
other spineless savages.

392
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:20,083
[IBUKI]
Huh?

393
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:21,166
That's because

394
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,250
he is going to be
king of Nil Kamui.

395
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:24,333
If that's the case,

396
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:26,500
then you'll make
for a tough opponent!

397
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,875
Thank you very much.
I appreciate it.

398
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:33,916
[KA GRAVA]
Speaking strictly of results,

399
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,375
killing Gakusho or
sealing the negotiations

400
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:38,166
by having her
read that letter...

401
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,916
Those were the only
two choices you had

402
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,541
from the very beginning.

403
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:44,208
The latter choice was
very difficult to achieve,

404
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:45,500
given the situation.

405
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,458
Yet, even when
you were at a loss,

406
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:51,041
you never gave up on your ideal,
right to the very end.

408
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,875
I acknowledge you as a person

409
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:57,625
worthy of imparting
my knowledge to.

410
00:18:57,708 --> 00:18:58,958
[IBUKI]
But...

411
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:02,375
What I did led to Haiga
being occupied by Kouran.

412
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:03,958
[KA GRAVA] I'm merely
having them stationed here

413
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:05,666
for military purposes.

414
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:08,833
Additionally, Kouran won't be
the only one stationed here.

415
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:10,416
[IBUKI]
Huh?

416
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:14,375
[KA GRAVA] D'natia's ambassador
should be arriving here shortly.

417
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:16,500
[IBUKI]
Who is this ambassador?

418
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:20,416
[KA GRAVA] Oh, someone you
are very well acquainted with.

419
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,041
[IBUKI]
Sweallow?

420
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:23,875
By bringing in both forces,

421
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:26,208
the balance of power
between Kouran and D'natia

422
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:27,500
can be kept.

423
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,833
I guess we were collectively
manipulated by you

424

this entire time, weren't we.

425
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:34,583
[KA GRAVA] This is just
a temporary solution.

426
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:36,958
Their forces led me to
surrender Haiga's position

427

as an independent city.

428

[KA GRAVA]
This is fact.

00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:44,333
That's about all a petty
merchant like me can do.

430
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:47,041
Now then, would you mind
gathering everyone together?

431
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:49,583
As promised,
I'll talk about Red Dragon.

And unbeknownst to you,

Why didn't you kill me?

00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:13,083
Is it because
I'm not your friend?

440
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:16,500
Or is it because
I am your friend?

Either way...

Thanks for that.

Now then, as promised.

445
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:33,083
Red Dragon, was it?
I have a message from him.

Yes, that's right.

Honestly.
