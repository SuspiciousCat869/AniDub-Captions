And like a sacrificial swine,

to see you in this state.

160
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:11,750
Kneeling over the corpse
of a Kouiran General--

161
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:13,291
[EYKHA]
Stop it!

162
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,583
Having his best interest at
heart won't make you friends.

163
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:17,125
That's some nerve.

164
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:18,916
I am merely a loyal subject,

165
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,416
I would never overstep
those bounds!

166
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,500
[IBUKI cries]

167
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:36,083
[ULRIKA] Thank you all for
coming on such short notice.

168
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:37,625
[SWEALLOW] I hope
you guys don't mind,

169
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:39,125
but you're not gonna
be able to walk around

170
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:41,791
the fort unsupervised.
There's a lot of secret military

171
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:44,625
stuff here that we
can't let outsiders see.

172
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:46,250
[LOU]
Naturally.

173
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:50,708
[ULRIKA]
Lady Lou Chun Wah?

174
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:52,291
Yes?

175
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:54,333
[ULRIKA] I was wondering if you
had seen one of my subordinates.

176
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:57,291
He still hasn't returned
after the recent deployment.

177
00:10:57,375 --> 00:11:00,250
[LOU] Curious. I was under
the impression D'natia

178
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:02,500
used something to
contact people far away,

179
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:04,708
not unlike our
Communication Seals?

180
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:06,708
He isn't responding.

181
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,416
That certainly is troubling.

182
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:12,166
However, I'm afraid I
don't know anything.

183
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:17,541
[KA GRAVA] You're saying there
were more Returned Ones

184
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:19,041
outside of Gakusho's unit?

185
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:21,250
[ULRIKA] Correct. The
foot of Ogani Volcano

186
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:23,750
is surrounded by
different villages.

187
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:26,125
Hordes of Returned Ones
began attacking them,

188
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:28,708
and not long after, those
who had fallen revived.

189
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:30,708
Any idea where the first
batch came from?

190
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:32,208
That might explain all this.

191
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:34,041
According to the few survivors,

192
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:36,208
The earliest raid was
conducted by beings

193
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:38,958
sporting revolutionary
army garb.

194
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:42,500
[HIEN] Are you trying to say
that we're the ones to blame?

195
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:43,791
[EYKHA]
Wait.

196
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:46,958
Were they the members
of the first expedition?

197
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:48,458
[ULRIKA]
It would appear so.

198
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,041
After all, word is one of your
battalions had approached

199
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:53,875
the volcano about a month ago.

200
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:55,458
[RED DRAGON roars]

201
00:11:55,541 --> 00:12:00,000
[EYKHA] They rose as
Returned Ones? All of them?

202
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:07,333
[SWEALLOW] What's the deal
with this, Ka Grava?!

203
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:10,083
I mean, am I wrong, or
are we saying Red Dragon

204
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:12,875
is responsible for everything
that's going on here?

205
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:14,208
[KA GRAVA]
Perhaps.

206
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:16,416
Do you believe that we
should question his claim

207
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,416
of leaving something
behind at Ogani Volcano?

208
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,750
That doesn't change anything,
we still have to go.

209
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:25,500
There's something else.
As we speak, Simeon,

210
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:27,291
the Black Dragon Knights'
third corps leader,

211
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:29,041
is headed toward us.

212
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,000
[HIEN]
Wait, he's on his way here?

213
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,041
[LOU]
Huh.

214
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:34,166
[SWEALLOW]
That's great! But, uh...

215
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,000
Who is that again?

216
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:38,333
He leads the squadron
of soldiers our country

217
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:39,958
has deployed to this island.

218
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:42,125
Ranked third of the
Black Dragon Knights.

219
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:43,291
Oh, that's cool.

220
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:45,750
On the subject of rank,
uh... What's mine?

221
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:47,875
Why, you're the 30th, of course.

222
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:48,958
Dead last.

223
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:50,916
Uh...

224
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,833
Soon, everything will
be made right again

225
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:55,125
because Simeon will be
here to save the day.

226
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:56,875
You have a lot of
confidence in him.

227
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:59,041
Yes, I do. So now...

228
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:01,791
You can leave the
rest of this to us.

229
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:09,291
[ULRIKA] You're still set
on going to Ogani Volcano?

230
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:13,250
I have to. There's no way I
can just sit back and watch.

231
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:16,000
Not after what
happened to Gakusho.

232
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:17,541
Well then, at the very least,

233
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:20,250
you should allow my unit to
accompany you on the journey.

234
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:21,625
You'll still help us?

235
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:23,291
[ULRIKA] I consider
it my personal duty

236
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:26,458
to protect this island's
citizens and maintain order.

237
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:29,000
I can't turn a blind eye when
the people are in need.

238
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:30,791
[HIEN]
Lord Ibuki.

239
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,583
I've been told about the
power you now possess.

240
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:41,833
Hien.

241
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:45,083
I beg you, once Simeon
arrives, take my life.

242
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:49,125
You want me to use the dragon's
flame to kill him, don't you?

243
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:50,625
[HIEN]
Of course!

244
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:52,500
It will spark the fire of
revolution throughout the land!

245
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:57,583
My lord. We'll rid Nil
Kamui of occupation!

246
00:13:57,666 --> 00:14:01,041
There is absolutely no way
I'm killing you or Simeon.

247
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:03,291
And it wouldn't
make a difference.

248
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:07,250
You don't know what you're
talking about, so forget it.

249
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:11,750
Nothing will happen if I hurt
you. It'd just be a waste.

250
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:13,333
No, it wouldn't.

251
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:16,708
As our lord, all the people of
our country are bound to you.

252
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:18,250
You can use us as offerings.

253
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:20,458
That's not the point, Hien!

254
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:21,583
Perhaps.

255
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:24,375
But kindness clouds
your judgment.

256
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:26,833
The Seven Year War
took my family.

257
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:29,000
Not even my little
sister survived.

258
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:31,708
And a part of me died
along with them.

259
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:33,708
But that's why I'm
the perfect sacrifice,

260
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:35,208
no one will mourn my death.

261
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,166
So if the Child of
Contract needed my life,

262
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,750
I would give it with pride.

263
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:43,625
You see? Please don't
hesitate on my behalf!

264
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:45,000
That's not why!

265
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:46,791
I hope I'm not
interrupting anything,

266
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:48,625
but our ride is
waiting for you two.

267
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:50,416
[IBUKI]
Right.

268
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:54,833
[HIEN] I should be used to
such disrespect from Kouran!

269
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:56,000
[LOU]
Sorry?

270
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:57,291
[HIEN]
Whether he acts like it or not,

271
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:59,833
Lord Ibuki is the
successor to the throne.

272
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:01,375
You will address him properly.

273
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:04,166
Oh, my, how could I
have been so rude?

274
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:07,791
So it's "Lord" Ibuki, yes?

275
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:18,208
Hey, Lord Ibuki?

276
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:20,625
Did Hien tell you
to call me that?

277
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:22,083
Please just ignore him.

278
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:23,625
Why, too much?

279
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:26,000
If you want, we can ease you
into it by calling you "sir."

280
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:27,250
[laughs]

281
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:28,958
[IBUKI]
Uh...

282
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:30,083
[SWEALLOW]
So Meryl told me

283
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:32,000
that you were planning
to kill Gakusho,

284
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:33,333
and that somehow
you'd be able to

285
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:35,166
destroy her murderer
because of it.

286
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,416
Well, technically
Red Dragon would.

287
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,791
I think I get it.

288
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:40,916
In exchange for the
life of someone else,

289
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,416
the Dragon grants you--

290
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,125
Perhaps it would be wise to drop
the subject, Sir Sweallow.

291
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:47,375
You've known about this
all along, huh, Lou?

292
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:49,166
Why, of course not!

293
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,625
It's such a frightening thought.

294
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:51,916
I agree.

295
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,083
Now I get why you
called it a curse.

296
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:57,083
You mind if I ask
you something else?

297
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:59,875
Do you really wanna rid
yourself of that power?

298
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:02,583
How can you afford to if
you're going to become king?

299
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:03,666
[gasps]

300
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,208
It's scary.

301
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:08,666
But something like that could
come in handy for a monarch.

302
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:12,000
Maybe, but that's not the
type of king I want to be.

303
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:13,791
I lost a friend recently.

304
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:16,666
She thought I could put an
end to people's sorrow.

305
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,250
I want to.

306
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:19,666
But with this power...

307
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:20,666
I can't.

308
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,166
Guess not.

309
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,416
Anyway.

310
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,500
I'm actually in favor of
you losing that ability

311
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:26,791
in the long run.

312
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:28,333
[LOU]
Of course you are.

313
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:30,833
A weapon like that is a
major threat to D'natia.

314
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:32,125
[SWEALLOW]
Ha! You think so?

that leaving and letting

Even at the expense

I'm staying.

[SWEALLOW]
But why?

363
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:33,583
[EYKHA] Because I believe
Izun would want me

to free him from this
terrible existence.

is Red Dragon's talon.

[EYKHA] He engaged the
Red Dragon by himself

so Val and I could escape.

to take care of Meryl.

And watch our backs
from a safe distance.
