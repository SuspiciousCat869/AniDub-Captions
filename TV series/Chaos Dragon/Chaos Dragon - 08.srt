1
00:00:13,125 --> 00:00:14,291
[MASHIRO]
I'm sorry,

2
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:16,333
but this is all I have
to give you right now.

3
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:19,125
[EYKHA]
Thank you.

4
00:00:19,208 --> 00:00:23,583
But, I cannot accept this as
I have no way to repay you.

5
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:26,083
Actually, you can do
something for me.

6
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:27,333
You're strong.

7
00:00:27,416 --> 00:00:30,250
So I'd like you to help
me protect my friend.

8
00:00:31,791 --> 00:00:35,166
Protect? What do you mean?

9
00:00:38,083 --> 00:00:39,583
I'm talking about Ibuki.

10
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:41,333
With things being
the way they are,

11
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:43,416
I don't think I can protect
him all by myself.

12
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,458
[gasps]

13
00:00:46,791 --> 00:00:49,916
All right, fine.
It's a promise.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,416
Thank you so much, Eykha.

15
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,083
[IBUKI] The name of our
country is Nil Kamui.

16
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:57,125
It's a small island nation.

17
00:00:57,208 --> 00:00:59,291
Three years have passed
since our land fell

18
00:00:59,375 --> 00:01:01,750
to the great neighboring
nation of Kouran.

19
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:03,083
Our ally, D'natia,

20
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:05,583
maintained their distance,
and our guardian deity,

21
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:07,250
Red Dragon, went mad.

22
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:09,583
I lost everything in
this conflict known

23
00:01:09,666 --> 00:01:11,416
as the Seven Year War.

24
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,500
Our castle, from which we
once ruled over the country,

25
00:01:14,583 --> 00:01:18,541
my parents, my sister,
Inori, all of it.

26
00:01:18,625 --> 00:01:22,208
Imperial Era 3015. October.

27
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:26,083
Nil Kamui is still not
under our control.

28
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:01,125
Forgive me for asking,

29
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:03,041
but didn't all your
family members die?

30
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:04,916
[IBUKI]
When the castle fell,

31
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,583
I was the only one in my
household to survive.

32
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:10,541
Or, so I'd believed. Till now.

33
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:12,083
[LOU]
Whatever the circumstance,

34
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:14,916
the next thing you should do
is meet with her face-to-face.

35
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,708
Lou! Are you okay?

36
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:18,083
[MERYL gasps]

37
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:20,625
I'm a member of
this expedition.

38
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:22,916
I won't die because of
something like this.

39
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,750
[KA GRAVA] We need to
get you treated, now!

40
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:39,333
[IBUKI]
Uh!

41
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,166
Ogani Volcano erupted?

42
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:43,875
[MERYL] But it showed
no signs of activity

43
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:45,333
during the investigation.

44
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:46,791
[KA GRAVA]
This is bad.

45
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:50,250
If this keeps up, the fort
is going to be in danger!

46
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:52,375
[SIMEON]
Open the gate!

47
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,333
Huh. Anyone recognize that guy?

48
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:04,083
Oh, come on! You
can't be serious!

49
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:06,375
That's Lord Simeon,
leader of the third corps!

50
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:07,833
Oh, yeah, of course!

51
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:10,458
I remember now! It
just slipped my mind.

52
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Contract seal, release!

53
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,208
[SIMEON grunting]

54
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:49,708
[KA GRAVA]
He averted the lava flow!

55
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,583
Lord Simeon is a
powerful one, indeed.

56
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:55,041
Unbelievable.

57
00:04:58,291 --> 00:04:59,791
[SIMEON]
Not even half the power

58
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:04,250
granted by Black Dragon should
have shown here on this island.

59
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,500
Dear Brother!
It's really you!

60
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:26,750
--[INORI grunts]
--Thank Goodness!

61
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:29,958
[IBUKI]
I... Inori?

62
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:31,791
I missed you so much.

63
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:33,041
Look at that!

64
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:34,666
Not really sure what to
do in these situations.

65
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,041
Yes, I know.

66
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:37,166
Meryl, are you crying?

67
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:40,541
[gasps] No, of course I'm not!

68
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:43,541
[IBUKI] I can't believe
it. It really is you!

69
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:45,291
[INORI]
Yes. It is.

70
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:46,500
I almost forgot!

71
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:49,458
There's someone I wanted
to introduce you to.

72
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:53,541
[gasps]

73
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,791
Ibuki.

74
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,666
Mashiro...?

75
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,541
[INORI]
I met her at Shuka.

76
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:05,958
I knew you'd want to see her,

77
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:09,625
so I brought her to you as
soon as I could, brother.

78
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:11,625
Hold on. Wasn't
she the one that--?

79
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:13,000
[MERYL grunts]

80
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:19,416
[EYKHA gasps]
Mashiro?

81
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,625
[IBUKI, INORI gasp]

82
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:25,250
Mashiro? No way.

83
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,541
We know Mashiro died.

84
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:34,083
And I've heard that
Inori died, as well.

85
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:35,416
[door opens]

86
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,541
[FUGAKU] On the contrary,
Lady Inori was alive.

87
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:40,041
By order of Agito,

88
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:42,041
I was the one who
brought Lady Inori here.

89
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:46,333
No way! You mean Agito was
sheltering her all along?

90
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:48,750
--Help!

91
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:49,958
--[FUGAKU] No, stop!
--They're still inside!

92
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:51,541
There's nothing we can
do for them anymore.

93
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:54,625
Kouran's army will be on top of
us in a moment, we have to go!

94
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:57,083
But we--! [gasps]

95
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:58,708
Agito!

96
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:01,875
I will save Lady Inori.

97
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:12,375
After some time had passed,
I visited Shuka's prison...

98
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:15,291
No, it can't be. Lady Inori?

99
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:18,000
If it's discovered that
both Imperials are alive,

100
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:20,875
Kouran would surely
move into action.

101
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:22,208
[AGITO]
It was necessary

102
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:24,541
to hide her away somewhere
until the time was ripe.

103
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:26,458
Fortunately, because
of the untimely loss

104
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:27,916
of General Kohkaku,

105
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,625
Kouran is currently lost
in a state of confusion.

106
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:32,916
[FUGAKU]
I was completely unaware.

107
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,750
[INORI] From now on, let's
fight these battles together.

108
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:39,250
[AGITO] We will make Inori our
king, and free this island.

109
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:41,541
But... but what about Ibuki?

110
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:44,833
[AGITO] It was heart-wrenching
deceiving you all, believe me.

111
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:46,291
But in the end,

112
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:50,416
everything was for the sake
of regaining our country.

113
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:53,416
I didn't know about any of that.

114
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,583
Agito put that much
thought into all of this?

115
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:58,750
Lady Inori would like
to meet with you again.

116
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:00,208
This time, at the embassy.

117
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:02,333
[IBUKI]
Understood. Count me in.

118
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:04,416
Wait. But what about Mashiro?

119
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,666
You killed her, didn't you?

120
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,625
[IBUKI]
Yes.

121
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:11,500
I killed her.

122
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:13,125
But...

123
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:14,583
Yes, it's strange.

124
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:18,375
I was only recently told of
how Lady Inori was alive.

125
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:21,083
You should speak with
Mashiro to settle this.

126
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:23,708
Oh, by the way, where's Hien?

127
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:28,458
[IBUKI] He's dead.
He gave his life for me.

128
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:32,500
[FUGAKU] I see. I'm sure
he went with honor.

129
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:36,833
[SWEALLOW]
Amazing. He actually did it.

130
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:39,000
Ka Grava built an
embassy for us.

131
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:41,625
[MERYL] Enjoy it while it lasts.
I'm sure it'll be in shambles

132
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:44,041
within the month with
you here, Sir Sweallow.

133
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:47,083
[ENUMAEL] Did you call for me,
Mister Ambassador?

134
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:51,041
Your Exellency.

135
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:52,791
I certainly did.

136
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:54,958
I was hoping you could
tell me more about Inori.

137
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:56,583
Who is she, really?

138
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:58,666
[ENUMAEL] She is the
true Child of Contract,

139
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:01,000
and the true ruler of Nil Kamui.

140
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:03,125
Our country will
protect Lady Inori

141
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:06,458
and help her regain the
dynasty she so truly deserves.

142
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:08,333
[SWEALLOW exhales]
So what you're saying

143
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:10,583
is that you'll end up
with a puppet government.

144
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:12,458
[ENUMAEL] I would prefer
that you acknowledge them

145
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:16,041
as being a sibling country led
by D'natia's grand teachings.

146
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:18,458
[SWEALLOW]
Is that so.

147
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:21,625
While on the subject, do you
think there's any chance

148
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:24,000
that Inori could
be a Returned One?

149
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:26,875
Come now, that's absurd.

150
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:31,041
Not too long ago, we
had the misfortune

151
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:32,750
of fighting the
walking dead.

152
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,416
And now we've learned
that an Imperial

153
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,541
that was initially reported to
be deceased has appeared.

154
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:39,375
Wouldn't that make
you suspicious?

155
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:40,750
Surely, you jest!

156
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:43,583
Why would we make such
a foolish assumption?

157
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,875
When Lady Inori came
under our protection

158
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:47,416
from the revolutionary army,

159
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,208
we conducted a very thorough
background check using magic,

160
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:52,125
specifically focusing
on the possibility

161
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:53,750
of her being a Returned One.

162
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:55,625
Of course, we found nothing.

163
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:57,750
I personally believe
she is quite suited

164
00:09:57,833 --> 00:10:00,000
to lead the
dragon-revering savages.

165
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:03,250
After all, miracles are
adored by the ignorant.

166
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:04,541
Interesting assessment.

167
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:06,041
You know, you could
say the same thing

168
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:08,666
about the Black Dragon Knights.

169
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:10,875
[KA GRAVA]
It took some time,

170
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:14,083
but I have examined the
wedge of the Yellow Dragon.

171
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:17,041
Did you find that it
piqued your interest?

172
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:18,375
[KA GRAVA]
The magic we use

173
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:20,958
is affected by the magic
dwelling within each land,

174
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:24,166
also known as the country's
"State Magic Territory."

175
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:27,125
You could approach it as a
"home" or "away" concept,

176
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:28,875
but it seems as if this wedge

177
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:32,416
can tilt the balance
towards Kouran.

178
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,666
It looks like there's value
in working out a deal

179
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,791
with you after all.

180
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:38,708
[LOU]
Why of course there is.

181
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:41,416
Now then, arrange for
my artificial arm.

182
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,666
[KA GRAVA]
Understood.

183
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:45,291
The driving force behind
humans seems to be

184
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,791
how they use and
abuse one another.

185
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:49,583
All that remains for
them to figure out

186
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:52,333
is whether they can feel
good about doing so.

187
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:53,708
That being the case,

188
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:55,416
do you think that's
what gives meaning

189
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,125
toward a trusting
relationship?

190
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:59,666
[SHADDY] Is this really
okay, Lord Ka Grava?

191
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:03,166
[KA GRAVA] Regardless of D'natia
or Kouran, if the wedge is used,

192
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:06,750
the balance of Nil Kamui's State
Magic Territory will crumble.

193
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,541
The land will suffer, even
in relation to its magic.

194
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:12,041
That's why we need to stop
as much of this as we can

195
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:12,958
before it starts.

196
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:14,625
Lord Ka Grava.

197
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:16,083
Mm.

198
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:17,583
[KA GRAVA] I made a promise
to my wife before she died

199
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:20,125
that I would protect
the future of you kids.

200
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:22,666
I intend to keep that promise.

201
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:36,041
[FUGAKU] Good work.
You've guarded Ibuki well.

202
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:39,208
You can leave everything
else to us now.

203
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,291
Welcome, Dear Brother of mine.

204
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:52,791
[INORI laughs]

205
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:56,541
[KA GRAVA]
I wouldn't if I were you.

206
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:58,833
Even if you go now,
I doubt your thoughts

207
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:01,166
will get through to Ibuki.

208
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:14,500
I saw it. Mashiro
offered her life.

209
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:17,625
She should be dead
now as an equivalent.

210
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:22,541
[KA GRAVA] I'm in quite
the predicament,

211
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:25,458
as I've not yet witnessed
Ibuki's power for myself.

212
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:26,833
That's why you--!

213
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:28,500
[KA GRAVA] That's why I see
the value in confirming

214
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:33,166
your suspicion. Isn't that
what you had in mind?

215
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:35,875
You're the one who built
this embassy, right?

216
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:38,416
Tell me. Is there a
way to see inside?

217
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,083
[KA GRAVA]
Such an accusation!

218
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:41,375
Even I wouldn't
do something as--

219
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:43,916
[SHADDY]
I'll set it right up for you!

220
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:49,125
Yeah, I thought so.

221
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:53,250
My dearest brother.

222
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:55,458
You must have gone through
so much on your own.

223
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:57,250
And you, too.

224
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:01,250
You and I were born into
this world as twins.

225
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:03,125
And according to
ancient tradition,

226
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:06,083
I was determined to be
the king of our land.

227
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:09,458
[IBUKI]
Yes, I remember, Inori.

228
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:10,666
[INORI]
That is why...

229
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,541
there's nothing for
you to worry about.

230
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:19,416
That can't be!

231
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,291
The revolutionary army
fought to place Ibuki

232
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:24,333
on the throne of Nil Kamui.

233
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:25,833
[INORI laughs]

234
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:27,958
I can leave you alone for a bit
with Mashiro, if you like.

235
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:30,833
Uh! That's not...!

236
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:32,958
Hi, Ibuki.

237
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:41,958
I still can't believe
this is happening!

238
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:44,916
Mashiro, you're really alive!

239
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,666
It's all because
of Red Dragon!

240
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:49,458
He looks over us and
protects us! Listen!

241
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:52,333
Let's all live here in this
place together, okay?

242
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:54,958
Just the three of us!
You, me, and Mashiro!

243
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:58,500
I'll be the king, and Dear
Brother will help me!

244
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:01,541
I'm sure we'll make a
wonderful country together!

245
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:07,291
Our Emperor has given us orders

246
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:09,375
to guard Bishop
Enumael and Inori.

247
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:13,208
To achieve this, we must head
to the town of Haiga posthaste.

248
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:14,958
[ULRIKA] I sense
something troubling you.

249
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:17,666
Were you aware of that
girl Inori, Sir Simeon?

250
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,541
[SIMEON]
No, not at all.

251
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:24,166
The Bishop will be questioned
at length in regards to her.

252
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,458
If we leave, our mission
of stationing ourselves

253
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:27,375
here will obviously be--

254
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:28,625
[SIMEON]
Regarding that,

255
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:31,458
we have proper support
to fill our positions.

256
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:32,666
You may enter.

257
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,125
[door creaks]

258
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:38,208
Wait, I know that emblem.

259
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:40,958
We are the Emperor's
personal order of cavaliers.

260
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:43,708
We will gladly take over
here in Nil Kamui.

261
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:47,541
Thank you. I will be on a
mission, headed to Haiga.

262
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:49,583
I assign Tricolor
and Black Tongue

263
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:52,375
to handle the colonial
towns near the rear.

264
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:56,041
Ruby and Blenheim, you two
will head towards Shuka.

265
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:57,458
[SOLDIERS]
Sir!

266
00:14:57,541 --> 00:14:59,416
Come on, Ulrika.
Let's get moving.

267
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,500
[ULRIKA]
Sir!

268
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,583
[EYKHA]
What are you talking about?

269
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:06,791
Weren't you going to
be king of this island?

270
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:11,041
Everything's okay, Eykha.
After all, Mashiro's alive now.

271
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:12,166
[gasps]

272
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:15,791
[MASHIRO]
Just be a good king. Ibuki.

273
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:19,166
She's been alive
this whole time.

274
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:22,250
Don't you see?
I didn't kill her!

275
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:27,500
Ibuki, Mashiro wanted to
sacrifice herself for you.

276
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:28,875
Nothing's changed.

277
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:30,208
Just because she's alive

278
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:32,208
doesn't mean your
promise to her is gone.

279
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:35,375
You're the one who's going to
become king of this Island.

280
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:38,625
And I'm the sword that
will bring that about.

281
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,500
We've received numerous
reports from Shuka,

282
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:49,375
tales of Inori appearing and
taking Mashiro with her.

283
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:52,208
But the details of such
appearances are still unknown.

284
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:55,958
[KA GRAVA] Good work.
Thank you for your efforts.

285
00:15:56,041 --> 00:16:00,583
We even made a grave for her.
I'm telling you, she's dead.

286
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:02,291
[KA GRAVA]
It's difficult to confirm death,

287
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:04,458
even for an experienced doctor.

288
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:07,500
There are instances of the dead
reviving after their burial.

289
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:10,750
[EYKHA] Not in this case. Ibuki
told me her heart was pierced.

290
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:13,625
[KA GRAVA] Or, maybe this
girl is just a stand-in.

291
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:17,458
It's also possible that she's
Mashiro's long lost twin.

292
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:20,083
Additionally, there doesn't
seem to be anything unusual

293
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:23,291
about her. She's just been
sitting there the whole time.

294
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:24,875
Sitting there?

295
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:26,458
[gasps]

296
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:27,875
[EYKHA]
This whole time.

297
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:32,500
Just sitting there, not eating,
not sleeping. No way.

298
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:35,250
Mashiro is a Returned One!

299
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:37,916
[KA GRAVA]
Hm...

300
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,208
And that means
Ibuki is in danger.

301
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,083
[KA GRAVA] What are the odds
of there being a Returned One

302
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:43,458
who retains their sanity?

303
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:45,583
Don't forget Izun!

304
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:53,083
[KA GRAVA] Circumstantial. That
alone isn't proof of anything.

305
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:55,583
[EYKHA]
I understand. Well then.

306
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:58,916
I'll just have to find
a way to get proof.

307
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:05,125
[EYKHA] I'm here as
Lord Ibuki's messenger.

308
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:09,416
I have a letter for Lady Inori's
waiting maid, Mashiro.

309
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,875
I see. No problem.

310
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:14,041
You want to see her
somewhere out of view, right?

311
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:28,458
Let me ask you something: do you
remember the first time we met?

312
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:32,791
I promised you that I would
protect Ibuki. Right?

313
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:34,833
You two were different
from the others.

314
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:37,833
You never threw rocks at
Bounded Ones like myself.

315
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:41,750
You both treated me like
a normal human being.

316
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:44,791
I'm sure Ibuki will spread
such feelings of kindness

317
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:47,875
and acceptance across
this entire island.

318
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:49,541
I'm bonded to Val here,

319
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:51,666
so I don't have many
years left to live.

320
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:54,458
But, I've decided to use
whatever remaining time I have

321
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:56,250
to protect Ibuki.

322
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:58,500
It's the same with you, right?

323
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:00,541
You offered your
life to Red Dragon

324
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:02,916
to help Ibuki become king.

325
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,625
That's the reason that he has
continued to keep your promise.

326
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:09,708
At the orphanage, he
saved all those children,

327
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:12,083
but he was forced to kill Kai.

328
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:13,666
In that moment I knew.

329
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:17,000
Ibuki was the one who should
become the king of this island.

330
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:18,750
[gasps]

331
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:21,583
Mashiro?

332
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:22,875
Ibuki.

333
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:24,416
[EYKHA]
Huh?

334
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:28,625
[EYKHA grunting]

335
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:34,875
[EYKHA] You don't remember
a thing, do you.

336
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:36,375
[MASHIRO]
Heh, heh.

337
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:38,333
I will protect Ibuki.

338
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:41,041
I'll die defending
my future king.

339
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:43,708
Enough! Stop smiling at me!

340
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:47,916
How dare you smile
using my friend's face!

341
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:53,875
[ENUMAEL] What in the world
is this business all about?!

342
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:55,666
I can't believe you
made me bring

343
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:58,583
this harmless waiting maid
all the way here for this!

344
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:00,791
[KA GRAVA] I'm terribly
sorry about that.

345
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:02,375
Where's Lady Inori?

346
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:04,125
[ENUMAEL]
Resting. As she should be.

347
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:06,875
[KA GRAVA] I see. Then let's
get started, shall we?

348
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:08,500
If you may, Eykha.

349
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:11,333
Eykha? What is this about?

350
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:15,000
It's Mashiro.
She's a Returned One.

351
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:16,750
[ENUMAEL]
What's this all of a sudden?

352
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:19,416
Is this Nil Kamui's
poor excuse for a joke?

353
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,583
[EYKHA]
Mashiro died once at Shuka.

354
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:24,166
But she came back to life.

355
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,416
That's what I thought.

356
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:29,291
She was killed by Ibuki.
Yet here she is. Good.

357
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:31,125
My memory's not
fleeting after all.

358
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:33,875
Hold on. You can see that
she's sitting right here.

359
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:36,750
It's true. And there are a
number of suspect things, but--

360
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:40,041
Look, she was saved by Lady
Inori's magic, nothing more.

361
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:41,458
I don't see the fuss.

362
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:43,041
[LOU]
Don't feel bad.

363
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:45,541
When I was first starting out,
I often thought I was killing

364
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:49,041
a person when in fact I was only
rendering them unconscious.

365
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:51,250
Turns out you have to behead
them to make sure.

366
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:53,500
[SWEALLOW] Uh, that's not what
we're talking about, Lou.

367
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:55,000
[ENUMAEL]
If you're going to accuse her

368
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:56,625
of being a Returned
One, then you should

369
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:58,541
at least show us
some form of proof.

370
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:00,750
[KA GRAVA] Well, Eykha?

371
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:05,041
I killed Mashiro
again last night.

372
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:07,166
[ALL gasp]

373
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,458
Right! Sure! And your point is?

374
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:12,583
She died by my hand
yesterday evening,

375
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:14,583
yet now she's here
in front of us.

376
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:16,166
She came back to life.

377
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,166
So she's--

378
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,083
[IBUKI]
Calm down! Take it easy!

379
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:20,958
[EYKHA]
Take her clothes off!

380
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:24,916
Ah, I see your plan. She
should have two scars.

381
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,583
One from when Ibuki killed her,

382
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:28,916
and another from when Eykha
killed her last night.

383
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,375
Wounds like that would
be hard to refute.

384
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:33,375
Come now! Don't be ridiculous!

385
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:34,833
That isn't proof of anything!

386
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:36,125
And aside from that,

387
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:38,291
making her take off her
clothes is outrageous!

388
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:39,625
[KA GRAVA]
Well, why don't we decide

389
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:42,000
after we take a look at this.

390
00:20:57,458 --> 00:20:59,708
No. Impossible.

391
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:01,458
[KA GRAVA]
Those images were recorded

392
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:04,625
by Haiga's security system.
As you can surmise,

393
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:07,875
there is no human that can
survive what you just saw.

394
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:09,583
So, there's only one
reason as to why

395
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:11,458
she would be here
in front of us.

396
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:13,416
[IBUKI]
It can't be...

397
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,708
Mashiro is...

398
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,500
[KA GRAVA] I need not
explain the dangers

399
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:20,208
involved with a Returned One.

400
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:23,583
As one who oversees Haiga, I
can't let this go unnoticed.

401
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:25,875
[ENUMAEL]
N-No, but, wait...

402
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:28,458
[INORI] What's with all
the commotion, everyone?

403
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:31,000
Yes, Mashiro is indeed
a Returned One.

404
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:33,083
Are there any
problems with that?

405
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:34,250
Huh?

406
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:35,416
[FUGAKU]
Lady Inori?

407
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,375
That girl is someone
who is very precious

408
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:39,333
and important to
my dear Brother.

409
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:41,166
That is why...

410
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:45,500
...I brought Mashiro
back from the dead.

411
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:50,791
But... Inori.

412
00:23:33,291 --> 00:23:37,625
[NARRATOR]
Chaos Dragon, Act 9. Winding.

413
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:39,500
The distorted and twisted heart

414
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:42,458
raises the curtain to
a stage of tragedy.

415
00:23:42,541 --> 00:23:44,958
How will this play turn out?
