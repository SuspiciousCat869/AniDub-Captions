[SOLDIERS screaming]

3
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:16,541
Fly, Val!

4
00:00:16,625 --> 00:00:18,000
[VAL roars]

5
00:00:20,166 --> 00:00:24,583
[EYKHA] Red Dragon, why?!
Everyone believed in you!

6
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:28,666
That you'd fight alongside us
in the revolutionary army.

7
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:31,333
Instead... you attack us?

8
00:00:31,416 --> 00:00:33,958
[RED DRAGON roars]

9
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:36,208
[EYKHA] Izun, a Bounded One
who shared a bond

10
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:37,666
with a great Stone Giant,

11
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:40,875
led the first expedition by
the Revolutionary Army.

12
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:44,250
Our fate was sealed the moment
he became the first to fall.

13
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:47,416
[STONE GIANT grunts]

14
00:00:49,208 --> 00:00:50,583
[EYKHA]
Izun!

15
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,375
Izun! What are you doing?

16
00:00:54,458 --> 00:00:56,875
Wait, stop this!
You don't have to die!

17
00:00:56,958 --> 00:01:01,958
[STONE GIANT growls]

18
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:04,458
[RED DRAGON roars]

19
00:01:13,208 --> 00:01:14,458
[EYKHA]
Trust me...

20
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:16,958
Red Dragon will not save us.

21
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:18,333
[gasps]

22
00:01:18,416 --> 00:01:20,583
[IBUKI] We hail from a
country known as Nil Kamui.

23
00:01:20,666 --> 00:01:23,041
It is but a small island nation.

24
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:26,416
We were invaded by the great
ancient country of Kohran.

25
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:31,083
And in their avarice, a third
of our land was pillaged.

26
00:01:31,166 --> 00:01:33,750
D'natia, an ally
state to the east,

27
00:01:33,833 --> 00:01:35,250
was quick to defend settlements

28
00:01:35,333 --> 00:01:38,083
where they had established
bases, but nothing more.

29
00:01:38,166 --> 00:01:41,375
And like a sacrificial swine,
Nil Kamui's land was carved

30
00:01:41,458 --> 00:01:45,375
and slowly devoured by
the two infiltrating powers.

31
00:01:45,458 --> 00:01:48,291
Amidst it all,
the island's Red Dragon deity

32
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:50,375
was suddenly
overcome with madness

33
00:01:50,458 --> 00:01:53,916
and began razing villages,
killing indiscriminately.

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,333
Imperial Era 3015, September.

35
00:01:57,416 --> 00:02:01,208
When all was said and done,
the country was no longer ours.

36
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,333
[KA GRAVA] As I said,
Red Dragon gave me a message.

37
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:39,750
He told me this back then,

38
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:42,500
and I now believe
I know what it means.

39
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,375
[RED DRAGON]
My dear friend.

40
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:52,958
A day will come when
I am greatly changed

41
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:54,833
from how you have known me.

42
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:58,416
No. It will be much
more dire I'm afraid.

43
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,250
[KA GRAVA]
What do you mean?

44
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:01,833
[RED DRAGON]
When it does,

45
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:05,375
go to Ogani Volcano.

46
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:10,083
That is likely the last place
I can maintain my sanity.

47
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:14,000
Or some semblance of it.

48
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:16,041
[KA GRAVA]
Red, are you trying to tell me

49
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:18,208
you'll leave something
there to be found?

50
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:22,250
[RED DRAGON growls]

51
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:42,125
[IBUKI]
Wait, that's all he said?

52
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:44,416
There wasn't anything more?

53
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,666
But this message...

54
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,333
Can we trust anything
that Red Dragon says?

55
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:49,833
[KA GRAVA]
It's what I was told.

56
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:52,916
I'll let all of you decide
whether you believe it or not.

57
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,375
Ugh.

58
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:01,958
[GAKUSHO]
Hey! So tell me, folks...

59
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:04,750
Where can a girl
get a bath around here?

60
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,000
Uh! General Gakusho?

61
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:11,166
[KA GRAVA]
A bath, you say?

62
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,875
Yeah, getting all my troops
stationed was pretty grueling,

63
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:15,958
so I'd like to take
a relaxing soak,

64
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:18,833
but, damn, this place
of yours is so big!

65
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:21,333
[SOL sighs]
Then follow me, General.

66
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:23,791
Come, I'll be happy
to show you the way.

67
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:26,958
[GAKUSHO] Oh, you're a
mixed one, and a cutie, too!

68
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:28,583
Stabby as well.

69
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:30,250
Ooh! Heh!

70
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:34,500
[MERYL] That's General Gakusho,
the Leader of One Thousand?

71
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:36,750
[doors rattle]

72
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:41,541
[SWEALLOW] Wow, Kouran
sure is diverse, isn't it?

73
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:45,833
Wait, so you want me to
speak with General Gakusho?

74
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:48,291
Yeah. About how both
of our forces

75
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:50,333
can coexist here in Haiga.

76
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:52,875
I do agree that's
an important topic.

77
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:56,208
But wouldn't that be your job
as ambassador, Sir Sweallow?

78
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:59,333
U-Um, well, yeah,
you see, about that...

79
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:01,000
[chuckles nervously]

80
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:04,041
What he means is he's just
recently arrived in Nil Kamui.

81
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:06,125
So you're more
knowledgeable than he is.

82
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:08,416
Um, yeah! What she said!

83
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,916
[ULRIKA giggles]
Plus, this just came together

84
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,708
on Ka Grava's whim.

85
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:14,625
Mm. Understood.

86
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:19,291
Do your best!

87
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:20,750
'Kay, Ulrika?

88
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,291
[sighs]

89
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:28,041
[ENUMAEL]
Sir Sweallow Clazzvali.

90
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:31,833
Yeah, that's me. And you are?

91
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:33,833
I'm Father Enumael Meschwitz,

92
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:37,500
bishop to the military
forces of D'Natia.

93
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:41,250
May I ask for a moment of your
time, Sir Black Dragon Knight?

94
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:43,916
Uh... Sure thing.

95
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:48,041
Ah, that's the ticket...

96
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:52,083
Hot damn, this bath is
really hitting the spot!

97
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:55,291
So... Do you have to be
in here with me right now?

98
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:57,583
We were informed this
bath is open to ladies,

99
00:06:57,666 --> 00:06:59,375
only during these hours.

100
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:01,583
I mean I want some privacy.

101
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:05,458
[LOU]
Oh, come now, General Gakusho.

102
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:08,625
I do believe I know of
your particular "tastes."

103
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:12,250
I'd love to get to know each
other on a personal basis.

104
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:15,250
So... Would you be interested?

105
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:18,541
No! I'm here to finish
what Kohkaku started!

106
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:19,958
Wait, Kohkaku?

107
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:25,041
[GAKUSHO] She promoted me so her
death hit me quite hard

108
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:27,500
and I've heard a rumor that
she was slain by someone

109
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:29,833
from Kohran and not
by a rebel soldier.

110
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,708
Impossible! That can't be!

111
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:34,666
Lady Kohkaku had been planning
to find and exterminate

112
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:37,833
Red Dragon before the
combined expedition could.

113
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:40,500
With her now gone, I'm going
to carry out that plan

114
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:41,916
in her place.

115
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,250
Therefore, my main force
will be heading out

116
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:48,750
to Ogani Volcano tomorrow.
Sorry, but that's the way it is.

117
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:51,333
[ULRIKA] No, a bath
is not what I requested!

118
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:54,625
[SHADDY] But, ma'am, I was
instructed to bring you in here!

119
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:56,791
[ULRIKA] Wait! What are you
taking off my armor for?!

120
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:59,583
[SHADDY] I have to!
It'll rust if I don't!

121
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:01,250
[SHADDY grunting]

122
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:02,708
--[SHADDY] There!
--[ULRIKA gasps]

123
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:08,791
[GAKUSHO] So... I understand
you wanted to meet with me?

124
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:11,125
[ULRIKA]
Um, yes, General Gakusho,

125
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:13,583
but I was hoping to meet
somewhere more private.

126
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:14,958
'Ey, come on, now.

127
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:17,333
You can't get much more
private than a ladies' bath!

128
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:20,541
Normally, yes, but there
are others present here.

129
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,041
[GAKUSHO]
Oh, them?

130
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:24,208
You know they're part of the
combined expedition, right?

131
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:26,375
[ULRIKA]
You're allies of Sir Sweallow?

132
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:27,833
[EYKHA grunts]

133
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:30,708
Feel free to bare your soul
or anything else in here.

134
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:32,166
[ULRIKA whimpers]

135
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:38,833
Notification was sent
to both Kouran and D'natia.

136
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:40,875
All military action
was ordered withheld

137
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,250
until the expedition
finds Red Dragon.

138
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:45,166
So then why did you
attack Haiga?

139
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,500
[GAKUSHO] It was because
there was rumor that Ka Grava

140
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:49,500
was backing the
revolutionary army.

141
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:52,083
But it was just a
misunderstanding.

142
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:53,666
According to the
pact we just made,

143
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,208
D'natia and Kohran won't
conduct any battles in Haiga,

144
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:58,166
which means it
won't happen again.

145
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:00,333
So we're good now, 'kay?

146
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:03,333
Well, I guess that
concludes our meeting.

147
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:05,166
Ah... No, wait.

148
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,791
Huh?

149
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:09,166
[ULRIKA] When it come to
our countries' policies--

150
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,791
[GAKUSHO]
Let me stop you there.

151
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:11,833
I'm a soldier, not a--

152
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:13,166
--[IBUKI grunts]
--[GAKUSHO gasps]

153
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,666
Oh, no! I'm so sorry!

154
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:18,041
Aw, if it isn't
the little Imperial.

155
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:19,625
Little Imperial?

156
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:22,208
So, he's part of the
expedition, as well?

157
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:24,166
[grunts] Uh, excuse me.

158
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,500
But have either
of you seen Eykha?

159
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:28,541
Would you believe this
adorable little thing

came close to assassinating me?

161
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:32,416
[IBUKI gasps]
Yeah, but--!

162
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,750
That power...

163
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:36,666
If you really do have it,
you should never use it.

164

you want so bad

166
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:43,416

everything to gain it?

167

Um, I don't know.

[GAKUSHO]
Honest, aren't you?

169
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,208
General Gakusho...

170
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:55,541
All that hostility she
showed me earlier is gone now.

171
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:02,083
Well, Sir Sweallow,

172
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:04,875
just what are you going
to do with this thing?

173
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:07,791
[SWEALLOW] A power that can
paint everything in black, huh?

174
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:13,000
[ENUMAEL] This item is called
the "Black Dragon's Scale."

175
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:14,375
Whoa, really?

176
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:16,875
According to legend,
it was created by alchemists

177
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:18,916
using a scale that
came from Black Dragon,

178
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,791
the guardian deity of D'Natia.

179
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:23,708
The Black Dragon, huh?

180
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:29,000
In Nil Kamui, both the power
of the Black Dragon Knights

181
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:31,500
and the magic of Kohran
aren't nearly as effective

182
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:33,458
as they are in their
native homelands.

183
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:35,250
You've noticed this,
haven't you?

184
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:38,416
I have, and for the life of me,
I couldn't figure out why.

185
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,083
Ever since we got
to this country,

186
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:42,625
I haven't been as powerful
as I normally am.

187
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,708
Because this island is
under the influence

188
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:48,125
of Red Dragon's power.
However... that's done!

189
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:49,583
[BOTH gasp]

190
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:51,791
[ENUMAEL] With this powerful
scale that I offer to you,

191
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:55,708
Nil Kamui's magical balance can
shift to that of Black Dragon.

192
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:58,291
In fact, if used properly,
the entire island

193
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:00,750
can be placed under the
power of Black Dragon,

194
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:03,000
and by proxy, D'natia.

195
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:05,791
Every aspect of this island,
from its water to its crops

196
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:08,250
to all of its numerous living
creatures are harmonized

197
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:09,791
through Red Dragon's power.

198
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:11,750
If that is forcefully
changed, then--

199
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:13,083
That is something
a mere attendant

200
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:15,375
such as yourself
needn't be concerned with.

Dragon, then it must be used."

203
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:23,500
That was our Emperor's order.

204
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:26,291
So this is our trump card
to defeat Red Dragon?

205
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:27,458
[ENUMAEL]
Yes.

I have faith that
you will use it wisely,

207
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:32,833
and lead D'natia
to a bright future.

[IBUKI] Yes. I do, and
that's why I need to get there

as soon as possible.

if you don't come along, Eykha.

If that's your choice,
Ibuki, I'll come with you.

the rest of our band?

[SWEALLOW] If I have to use that
scale, then no, count me out.

[LOU] Will you be joining us,
Sir Black Dragon Knight?

220
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:13,666

to go through the desert

221
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:16,583
to get to Ogani Volcano.
That's pretty dangerous!

Yes, that's true.

on a friend in need.

Actually, she left us behind.

on her way to Ogani Volcano.

Well, isn't that a coincidence?

She and I are both from Kouran,

Oh...

So, Ka Grava.

256
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:35,458
Were my father and all the
previous kings before him

257
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:39,291
granted this same power from
Red Dragon that I've described?

258
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:42,208
[KA GRAVA] Hmm, let me see
if I understand this:

259
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:44,458
your power lets you take one's
life with the flames

260
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:46,208
of Red Dragon, but to do so,

261
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:49,708
you must offer another one's
life to Red first, correct?

262
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:51,958
Yes, and the person
whose life is offered

263
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:54,083
is someone precious
to me, and so far,

264
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,375
it's always meant
the life of a friend.

265
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:57,583
[KA GRAVA]
Truth be told,

266
00:13:57,666 --> 00:14:00,208
I've never heard of
such a thing before.

267
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:02,666
Well, what about Red Dragon
going insane?

268
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:05,375
Could that be why I've
been cursed like this?

269
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:07,375
[KA GRAVA]
Possibly, but history does note

270
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:09,375
a certain king of the dead.

271
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:10,875
[IBUKI]
Who was that?

272
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:13,291
[KA GRAVA] An Imperial who
possessed a disturbing power.

273
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:15,708
It allowed him to raise anyone
he killed from the dead,

274
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:18,458
and reanimate them
as a Returned One.

275
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:19,958
A Returned One?

276
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:22,958
So then you mean a member
of the living dead?

277
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:25,916
But... I thought those
things were just legends.

278
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,041
[KA GRAVA]
I've never encountered

279
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:28,833
any Returned Ones before.

280
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:31,416
But legend says that those
slain by the king of the dead

281
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,875
will always rise
as Returned Ones.

282
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:37,041
Gathered together, they will
form an army of the unliving.

283
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:40,041
[IBUKI] Is that a power that
Red Dragon granted as well?

284
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:42,208
[KA GRAVA] A dragon has the
power to revive someone

285
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:45,500
as many times as needed, and the
power to take someone's life.

286
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:47,916
So if I were to guess,
I would say yes,

287
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,541
since killing and reviving are
two sides of the same coin.

288
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:53,291
Well, if I had my way,

289
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:56,125
I would only want the power
to revive someone.

the teeth-gnashing?

310
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:05,625
Well, ma'am. We're
not exactly sure yet,

311
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:07,875
but all who've fled the
areas around the volcano

312
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:10,416
are acting like him.

313
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:14,458
Returned Ones... Yes,
that's what those things were.

314
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:16,166
What else could walk
through the lava

315
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,916
as if it was nothing at all?!

316

[sobbing]

317
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:20,791
So Returned Ones, huh?

318
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:23,583
Do creatures like that
even really exist?

319
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:26,625
Question them and see if they
know anything about Red Dragon.

320
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:28,083
Right!

321

[gasps]

322
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:48,458
[GAKUSHO] You...
So that's why you're here.

323
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:53,625
I have no doubt that you
feel indebted to Kohkaku.

324
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:56,416
Even so, there's no way a
level-headed general like you

325
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,250
would go up against Red Dragon.

326
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:01,458
Unless, of course,
you had some secret weapon.

327
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:04,708
Huh. One derived from
Lady Kohkaku's work

328
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:06,708
and recently sent
from our homeland.

329
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:09,041
They call it the Gold Wedge.

330
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:10,625
[LOU]
Hmm...

331
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:12,208
It's quite marvelous.

332
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:14,875
According to my intel,
it will shift the balance

333
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:17,250
of this land's magic to Kouran.

334
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:20,250
What's more, the magic of
both D'Natia and Nil Kamui

335
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:22,541
will be severely
weakened as a result.

336
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,916
That means Red Dragon will, too.

337
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,958
My, my, what a frightening
item to possess.

338
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:29,708
[GAKUSHO]
If you want it, take it.

339
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:32,083
Very well, I will then.

340
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:33,291
[GAKUSHO] Wait.

341
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:35,791
There's something else
I wanna give you...

342
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:37,250
...your death.

343
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:40,541
As rumored, I see you
have no problem in killing

even your own people,
Lou Chun Wah!

345
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:45,291
I don't know what you've got
planned, but you made a mistake

346
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:47,666
by killing one
of my personal guards.

It's simply incredible.

00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:00,625
Hand it over!

351
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:03,125
[LOU] Why do that when you
already have that rifle?

352
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:06,125
[gasps]
I don't want it anymore!

353
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:09,541
But what I do want
is that sword!

[QI SHA TIAN LING] It seems
the Leader of One Thousand

355
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:18,666
had a counter skill ready.

356
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:21,041
So she was able to
divert my strike a bit.

357
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:23,458
I doubt that she'll
divert this next one.

No, don't bother, Lou.

She won't survive much longer.

360
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:30,250
Leave her paltry soul and keep
the female Black Dragon Knight

361
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:31,750
from getting away instead.

Wait, you mean Ulrika?

363

[QI SHA TIAN LING] I'm sure her

Fort Rosweisse is pretty close.

So the volcano
isn't far, either!

you that much,

had to deal with it

381
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:27,791
ever since I was a little kid.
It's the price of my power.

You've had it for that long?

383
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:31,791
It seems like it causes you
an awful lot of trouble.

384

Don't you ever wanna
get rid of it?

385

Well... Yeah, I've thought about
how my life would be without it.

386
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:39,500
because sometimes
it feels like a curse.

00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:41,791
Just like Sir Sweallow here,
you think your power

388
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:43,625
is a curse, too,
don't you, Ibuki?

Yes. I do.

to be done with it.

in here, because...

in action or even heard much

about it, so maybe
one of you guys

can explain it
to me, like, Eykha?
