I will save Lady Inori.

[IBUKI]
Agito! Be careful!

4
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,375
And please save her!

5
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,416
Where is Ibuki?

6
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:26,458
Where is my dear brother?

7
00:00:26,541 --> 00:00:28,791
[SOLDIER A]
Man, look at this stuff!

8
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:31,500
I can't believe they
just left it all behind!

9
00:00:31,583 --> 00:00:34,375
[SOLDIER B] I guess now that
their Child of Contract's dead,

10
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:37,833
Nil Kamui doesn't see
the value in much anymore.

11
00:00:37,916 --> 00:00:41,041
After seven long years,
this war's finally over.

12
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:42,583
My father's gone.

13
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:45,041
Why is this happening to us?

[AGITO]
Time's running out.

17
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:51,875
I think you'd better leave.

18
00:00:51,958 --> 00:00:53,791
But you're the one who
told us to come in here

19
00:00:53,875 --> 00:00:55,083
and take what we want!

20
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:57,416
Well it's your lives
on the line.

21
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,375
Uh!

22
00:00:58,458 --> 00:00:59,375
[SOLDIER B]
Will you hurry up?

23
00:00:59,458 --> 00:01:01,416
Just forget that old box!

24
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,583
[SOLDIER A]
All right, fine!

25
00:01:05,375 --> 00:01:07,958
[AGITO]
In that case, I'll take this.

26
00:01:08,041 --> 00:01:10,291
These fools don't realize
they're passing up

27

Nil Kamui's greatest
treasure: the Dragon Eye.

28
00:01:13,916 --> 00:01:15,666
There are supposed
to be two of these,

29
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,291
but the other was given to
Kouran's "spiritual mother"

30
00:01:18,375 --> 00:01:20,416
at this war's inception.

[AGITO]
Princess?

32
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:26,208
Agito. Tell me!

33
00:01:26,291 --> 00:01:28,958
Why have you done this?!

You have to save me.

I need you.

Pledge yourself to me, Imperial.

45
00:01:53,208 --> 00:01:57,541
Bond with me, and obtain
power for yourself.

46
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:06,750
[INORI]
Red Dragon called out to me.

47
00:02:06,833 --> 00:02:08,416
And when I heard his words,

48
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,750
I realized I had been waiting
my whole life for that moment.

49
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:16,166
With that, I made my vow.

50
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:25,333
Just had to get me
in private to talk.

51
00:02:25,416 --> 00:02:26,708
Well... Brother?

52
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:29,166
Is what you said before true?

53
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,166
[INORI] What, that
Mashiro's a Returned One?

54
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,916
Why would I lie about that?

55
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,500
Honestly, I was under
the impression you knew.

56
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:37,666
[IBUKI]
That's not what I'm asking!

57
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,375
I want to know how you were
able to do something like that.

58
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:42,333
[INORI]
Isn't that obvious?

59
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:44,500
This is the power Red
Dragon has given me.

60
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:47,333
You can raise the dead? Really?

61
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:49,583
[INORI] The ability to
take lives is a necessity

62
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:52,041
for a king's aide.
That's why you have it.

63
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:54,708
But the king is responsible
for deciding who lives.

64
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:58,375
So I was given power
worthy of that role.

65
00:02:58,458 --> 00:02:59,958
[grunts]

66
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:01,208
[gasps]

67
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:03,625
[INORI] The name of our
country is Nil Kamui.

68
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:06,041
It's a small island nation.

69
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:08,375
Three years have passed
since our land fell

70
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:10,916
to the great neighboring
nation of Kohran.

71
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,750
Despite the conflict, neither
the allied State D'natia,

72
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:18,583
nor our guardian deity Red
Dragon bothered to defend us.

73
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:20,375
I lost everything
in this conflict

74
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:23,791
known as the Seven Year War.

75
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:25,083
Our castle.

76
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:26,916
My purity and innocence.

77
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,875
Even the brother
I love so dearly.

78
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:33,958
Imperial Era 3015, October.

79
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:38,625
Nil Kamui was ours once,
and it will be again soon.

80
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:12,500
Oh! How absolutely dreadful!

81
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:15,291
To be stuck in the same
room as a Returned One!

82
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:17,500
[MERYL] But Bishop, you've
been traveling with Mashiro

83
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,833
as Lady Inori's attendant
for a while now.

84
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:21,125
[ENUMAEL]
I've had more important concerns

85
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:22,916
than the condition of
the lady's equerry!

86
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
So mind your tone!

87
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:25,375
[SWEALLOW growls]

88
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,666
[ENUMAEL] And besides,
Inori is only under my care

89
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,666
because Agito handed
her off to me.

90
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,208
[KA GRAVA] Agito, as in the
leader of the revolution?

91
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:33,791
That's really surprising.

92
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,208
Kinda goes against what
the revolution stands for.

93
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:38,375
Considering they want
their independence back,

94
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:41,166
it's hard to believe they'd
actually ask D'natia for help.

95
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,791
He didn't have much choice
after he was imprisoned.

96
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:46,083
His only hope of
furthering our goals,

97
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:49,583
was in pursuing D'natia's
support toward our future king.

98
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:52,958
Which would thereby assure
an alliance with Nil Kamui.

99
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:55,791
And then together, they
could drive out Kohran

100
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:59,041
without upsetting the
internal power structure.

101
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:00,416
Right. That said,

102
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,458
even I wasn't aware of
what Mashiro really was.

103
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:04,625
[LOU]
I've heard that dragons

104
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:07,041
are capable of
reviving after death.

105
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:09,333
And if that is indeed
a matter of fact,

106
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:12,916
creating a Returned One could
be an extension of that skill.

107
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,208
Then, that would prove Inori has
been accepted by the dragon.

108
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:18,416
[INORI grunts]

110
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:21,916
I can't believe
he's so paranoid,

111
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,833
he'd bug his own room!

112
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:25,000
[INORI giggles]

113
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:28,458
What was he thinking?
We wouldn't know?

114
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:30,958
Honestly, how rude.

115
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:34,916
[KA GRAVA sighs]

116
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:38,416
[IBUKI] It doesn't matter
if they listen in or not.

117
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,750
Because I won't keep a
secret from my friends.

118
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:44,708
[INORI]
And what about from me?

119
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:46,166
When we lost our home,

120
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:50,083
I was alone with no one to
turn to. So I ran by myself.

121
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:53,208
I did a lot of things I'm
not proud of to survive.

122
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:55,791
[IBUKI]
I'm sorry. Oh, Inori.

123
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:58,791
I wish that I had been
there to protect you.

124
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:00,166
[INORI]
The only person I trust

125
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,791
in this whole world
is you, my brother.

126
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:05,708
You have to feel the
same way about me!

127
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:08,583
Since you can't trust
the combined expedition.

128
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:10,166
But why?

129
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,708
[INORI] The only thing they care
about is destroying Red Dragon.

130
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:13,958
Because once he's dead,

131
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:16,500
they can finally take
control of Nil Kamui.

132
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:19,791
Are you going to let them take
our home again, brother?!

133
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:24,166
[EYKHA]
Ibuki!

134
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,625
[gasps] Are you all right?

135
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:27,708
[KA GRAVA] I take it you two
are finished speaking?

136
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:32,041
Yes. Now I'm certain
Mashiro is a Returned One.

137
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:35,625
You're saying Inori really
brought her back to life?

138
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:36,875
[ENUMAEL]
How absurd!

139
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:39,416
Who said you could do
such a terrible thing?

140
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:43,583
Now come along! We
need to have a talk!

141
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:47,833
[SWEALLOW]
That was fun.

142
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:51,000
He was sure quick to ditch
all that "my lady" talk.

143
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:53,000
It's sad, but
should be expected

144
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:56,625
considering we're merely
D'natia's puppet. Pardon me.

145
00:07:57,541 --> 00:08:00,541
Anyway. Where do we
all go from here?

146
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:03,000
[EYKHA] First, I will
dispose of Mashiro.

147
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:04,166
You will not!

148
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,083
[gasps] Why?

149
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:08,666
Because... I have
to sort things out.

150
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:11,833
I'm sorry, but please
give me some time.

It feels like my contract

00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:35,625
[BLACK DRAGON]
Sweallow Clazzvali.

161
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:38,375
Hear me, cursed child.

162
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:42,583
Because of your efforts, Nil
Kamui is in a state of change.

163
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:44,833
The land is being painted black.

164
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:45,916
[SWEALLOW]
Well, that's what your scales

165
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,583
were supposed to do, right?

166
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:49,208
[BLACK DRAGON]
True.

167
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:52,666
It shall not be long before my
essence has consumed that land.

168
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,708
Then I will preside over it
in addition to my kingdom.

169
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:57,166
[SWEALLOW gasps]

170
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,791
[BLACK DRAGON] Of course,
in order for this to happen,

171
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:02,458
I must take possession of
the red one's power as well.

172
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:06,375
Thus, it would appear you still
have work left unfinished.

173
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:07,708
About that.

174
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:10,416
Once the State Magic
Territory becomes D'natia's,

175
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:14,083
what's going to happen then?
To Nil Kamui's people?

176
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:17,000
[BLACK DRAGON] The citizens
shall remain unharmed.

177
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:20,166
However, they will no longer
be capable of magic.

178
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:23,458
Furthermore, the bonding of
beasts and man shall cease.

179
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:25,958
As will the lives
of such creatures.

180
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:29,083
Impressive. That's supposed
to be a good thing?

181
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:33,750
As a token of my gratitude, I
shall bestow upon you a gift.

182
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:36,291
I refer to it as
the "Black Curtain".

183
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:39,333
For it will veil you from
any external danger.

184
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:42,333
[roars]

185
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:46,041
[SWEALLOW screams]

186
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:47,375
Sir Sweallow!

187
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:51,208
[panting]

188
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:54,791
Hey. Tell me. Did you feel that?

189
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:56,333
[MERYL]
It was Black Dragon.

190
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:59,291
But how's that possible
when we're in Nil Kamui?

191
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:00,791
What can I say?

192
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:03,583
When you're popular like me,
no one cares about distance.

193
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:07,166
I suspect he's not happy about
me trying to protect Ibuki.

194
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,750
Oh, no...

195
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:11,125
Look, if you're nervous, I won't
blame you for going back home--

196
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:12,250
[groans]

197
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:14,000
[groaning]

198
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:16,458
So useless.

199
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:20,875
[INORI]
Don't you understand

200
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:23,625
what I'm trying to
tell you, brother?

201
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:25,708
I never wanted to be
D'natia's puppet,

202
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,791
but we can use it
to our advantage.

203
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:31,291
If we rebel, the revolutionary
army will rise with us

204
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:33,125
and we can take
them by surprise!

205
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:35,875
Together, we can finally
reclaim our home!

206
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:38,625
[IBUKI] If I join you, what am
I supposed to tell the others?

207
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:40,708
What will it take
for you to get this?

208
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:41,833
They're our enemies.

209
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:43,791
We're going to
have to kill them.

210
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:46,916
Because, eventually, they're
going to try to kill you.

211
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,916
[IBUKI]
No way!

212
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,625
They wouldn't do that to me.

213
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:53,125
[BLACK DRAGON] Ah. I can
hear your cries, young one.

214
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:57,250
And though you are not my child,
I will answer your call.

215
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,791
[IBUKI]
Red Dragon?

216
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,833
I didn't call you!

217
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:14,125
[BLACK DRAGON] Though I am
one of the Seven Dragons,

218
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:16,875
you are mistaken
as to my identity.

219
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:19,458
Yet, despite my body
residing in D'natia,

220
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:21,625
you still hear my
thoughts clearly.

221
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:23,583
Black Dragon.

222
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:26,375
[BLACK DRAGON]
I know you yearn for your island

223
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:28,916
to be returned
to its former order.

224
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,625
That is something only those
of my country can accomplish.

225
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:33,916
How so?

226
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,041
[BLACK DRAGON]
Kouran wishes to subjugate you

227
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:38,166
and those of your land.

228
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:41,541
The revolutionary army fights
against their persecution.

229
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:45,708
No matter the outcome, the blood
of many will continue to pour.

230
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,000
That is not your wish.

231
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:51,750
If you align with us, I vow that
your citizens will be unharmed.

232
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:53,833
That can't be. No way!

233
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:55,083
[BLACK DRAGON]
Such an alliance

234
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:58,875
would also benefit you
personally. After all,

235
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:02,750
it would finally bring about the
end of your cursed existence.

236
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:04,791
[IBUKI]
Red Dragon's power.

237
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:06,125
How?!

238
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:07,666
[BLACK DRAGON] You are
familiar with the concept

239
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,000
of a "State Magic
Territory," yes?

240
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:12,750
At the moment, Nil Kamui's
is shifting dramatically

241
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:15,458
to match D'natia.
Upon its completion,

242
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:17,416
Red Dragon will lose
his dominance,

243
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,541
and you will at last be
freed from your suffering.

244
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:22,916
But why? Is Sweallow to blame?

245
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,333
[BLACK DRAGON chuckles]

246
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:28,791
The fate of your country rests
in your hands, Imperial!

247
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:30,875
[IBUKI screams]

248
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,750
[BLACK DRAGON roars]

249
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:33,791
[IBUKI]
Ah!

250
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:36,666
[IBUKI]
D'natia.

251
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,166
Kouran.

252
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,416
They all act like they
know what I should do.

253
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,708
But, how come none
of them have advice

254
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:46,416
for handling Mashiro?

255
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:54,791
Where is she?

256
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:56,666
[SOL]
That bald blowhard came back

257
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,166
and dragged her off with him.

258
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,750
Said they had to
interrogate her

259
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:04,916
and that she'd be restrained in
the embassy for the time being.

260
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,666
[IBUKI] And you didn't do
anything to stop him?!

261
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:10,000
[KA GRAVA] He reminded us
she's Inori's attendant.

262
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:11,958
It was out of our hands.

263
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,250
She's still Mashiro.

264
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:17,458
Even if she's a Returned One.

265
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:18,958
[LOU]
There's your kindness again.

266
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:21,500
Listen, I understand what
you're going through.

267
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:24,000
Feeling such devotion. Still.

268
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:26,958
Once something's gone, it can
never be like it was before.

269
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:28,041
Uh!

270
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:30,333
Loss is inevitable
as you get older.

271
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:32,541
But it's because
we can lose things,

272
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:35,250
that we consider them
precious to us.

273
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:39,666
[LOU]
Uh...

274
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:47,666
[SWEALLOW]
Hey, Ibuki!

275
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,666
We were looking for you!

276
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:51,916
Uh!

277
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,791
[IBUKI] Sweallow's
D'natia's representative.

278
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:54,833
[IBUKI grunts]

279
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:59,541
[SWEALLOW]
Hey! Where ya goin'?

280
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:00,541
[IBUKI grunts]

281
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:02,791
Whoa, now. Where's
the fire, kiddo?

282
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,291
Oh. Sorry, uh...

283
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:06,333
I'm being followed!

284
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:07,375
[BYAKUEI]
Uh?

285
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:12,208
Shoulda known. Leave it to
D'natia to bully some kid.

286
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:13,625
[SWEALLOW]
Well, when you put it that way,

287
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:15,083
it does look pretty bad.

288
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:17,333
[MERYL] Could you defend
your image for once?!

289
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:18,833
[BYAKUEI] I don't know
what's going on here,

290
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:20,458
and honestly I don't care.

291
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:24,125
There's no way I'm turning my
back on a kid who needs help.

292
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:26,125
That's great! Ya hear that?

293
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:28,000
This guy's an
upstanding citizen!

294
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:30,458
How can you say that when he's
picking a fight with you?

295
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:32,166
[ULRIKA]
Sir Sweallow!

296
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,500
[SWEALLOW]
What's wrong, Ulrika?

297
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:35,375
Wait, Ulrika Ledezma?

298
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,041
They're Black Dragon Knights!

299
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:39,833
[ULRIKA] You know full well we
have a peace treaty with Kouran.

300
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:41,333
So explain yourself.

301
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:42,583
[SWEALLOW]
No, listen, it's cool.

302
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:44,666
He's actually a good guy!

303
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,458
[MERYL] You don't know
anything about him!

304
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:47,416
[SWEALLOW]
Mm?

305
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,708
[KOURAN SOLDIER A]
Sir Byakuei!

306
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:49,958
[KOURAN SOLDIER B]
Where are you?!

307
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:51,583
Hey, over here!

308
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:53,416
Sorry, got lost in the crowd!

309
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,791
[laughs]

310
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:57,083
This guy's... Byakuei?

311
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:59,541
[BYAKUEI] Guess I should
have introduced myself.

312
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:01,625
Probably not the best
first impression

313
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:04,125
considering I'm Kohran's
new representative.

314
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:06,708
I was actually headed to
Rosweisse to meet you guys.

315
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:08,458
Wait. I'm lost.

316
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:10,458
This man is Sir Byakuei.

317
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:13,666
But he's more commonly known
as the Leader of Ten-Thousand.

318
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,291
A Great General of Kouran.

319
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,541
I have to meet
with him, so move!

320
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:20,041
[GATE KEEPER A]
I'm afraid I can't.

321
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:22,333
The Bishop wants no disruptions.

322
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:23,708
[IBUKI, RED DRAGON]
You will!

323
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:28,000
None shall stand in the way
of Nil Kamui's imperial!

324
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:31,583
[IBUKI] Mashiro!
It's me! Where are you?!

325
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:33,041
[gasps]

326
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:40,333
[INORI] Ka Grava's such a riot!
He's wiretapped this whole city!

327
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:42,041
[laughs]

328
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:44,625
[IBUKI] I was told they
were holding Mashiro here.

329
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:46,750
Yeah, but... It's no big deal.

330
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:48,416
What do you mean,
"it's no big deal"?!

331
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,291
If the bishop really wants to
make you king like he says,

332
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:53,875
there's no way he'll let
a Returned One live!

333
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:55,500
Even one so docile.

334
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:58,166
So what? He can kill
her if he wants to.

335
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:01,250
I'll bring her back to
life again every time.

336
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:03,583
By the way, that also means
you can use your power

337
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:05,333
without any fear
of repercussion.

338
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:07,041
Well? Go wild!

339
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:08,333
If you don't know
where to start,

340
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:10,166
I think you should
nix that girl Lou.

341
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,458
[gasps]

342
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:13,416
After all, that sword she wields

343
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,625
makes it impossible to
revive Returned Ones.

344
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,916
And I want to see
what you can do.

345
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,291
Your gift from Red Dragon must
be amazing, dear brother.

346
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:26,250
Too bad. I'm never
using that power again.

347
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:28,041
Besides, if I were to kill Lou,

348
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:31,041
you'd have both Sweallow
and Ka Grava to deal with.

349
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:33,666
[INORI] I don't see the problem,
we'll just kill them, too.

350
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,250
Besides, you know the
expedition only formed

351
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:38,333
because they wanted
to kill Red Dragon.

352
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:40,708
Oh, but if you're
particularly fond of them,

353
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:43,166
I can always bring them
back to life for you.

354
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,875
Inori.

355
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:48,041
Don't worry. I'm more
than used to it by now.

356
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:49,250
[RED DRAGON roars]

357
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:52,083
[INORI]
I get it. I understand.

358
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:53,958
You're doing all of this for me.

359
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:58,958
Because I have so much rage and
sorrow that I can't let out.

360
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:00,791
More. It's not enough.

361
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:02,250
Destroy it all!

362
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:04,166
Burn everything!

363
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:06,083
It's what they deserve
for watching idly

364
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:08,250
as my life was stolen from me!

365
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:11,333
They're just as guilty as
those who attacked us.

366
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:13,166
They should all be incinerated!

367
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:16,125
And from the ashes, we'll
bring back the people we like.

368
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:19,333
Then, once Nil Kamui is
full of Returned Ones,

369
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:22,166
we'll have a home that's
kind to us again.

370
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,541
[INORI laughs]

371
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,875
[IBUKI] She honestly believes
Red Dragon's rampage

372
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:30,291
was a tribute to her. Is his
madness controlling her, too?

373
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:35,916
At this rate, Inori might
actually kill us all.

374
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,666
[laughing continues]

375
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,750
[IBUKI]
I think you're right, Inori.

376
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:42,208
But we should go to
Shuka's prison first.

377
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:43,625
[INORI]
Huh?

378
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:46,125
[IBUKI] Seeing as D'natia
won't support us anymore.

379
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:48,583
If we're going to place
you on the throne,

380
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:50,500
we'll need to get
Agito out of jail.

381
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:52,708
You mean it?! Oh, brother!

382
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:55,000
I can't tell you how happy I am!

383
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:57,625
Yeah, me, too.

384
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:00,541
[IBUKI] This whole time,
the other expedition members

385
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:02,916
have been protecting me.

386
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,875
They've made so
many sacrifices.

387
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:07,708
I won't let anyone hurt them.

388
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:09,750
Not even you.

Stay there, Ibuki.

00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,791
[IBUKI]
What's going on in here?

393
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:27,041
Mashiro?

I brought your dinner.

Are you in there?

398
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:46,166
[EYKHA]
So Ibuki hasn't come back yet?

399
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,625
No, I guess not.

400
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:54,458
[IBUKI]
Fugaku. Tell me what happened.

401
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:57,541
[FUGAKU]
All right. But it was awful.

402
00:18:57,625 --> 00:19:00,625
Enumael was angry and
wouldn't stop slandering us.

403
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:03,250
He said we were all
savages and heretics,

404
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:06,166
and that he was going to
have Mashiro exterminated.

405
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,916
[FUGAKU]
I think all the commotion

406
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,916
unleashed something within.
Because that wasn't Mashiro.

[FUGAKU]
Lady Inori watched in silence

419
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:03,833
as the bishop took
his last breath.

420

[INORI]
There you are!

421
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,583
Are you ready to
go now? To Shuka?

422
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:10,583
[IBUKI]
Not just yet. This first.

423

[INORI]
No. You two can talk later!

Wait, what are you doing?

What's wrong, brother?

But... Why?

428
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:27,625
You know that doesn't
accomplish anything.

429
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:29,833
I'll just bring her back.

[gasps]

432
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:33,958

You told me before,

433
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:35,916
I can offer you a Returned One

434
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,875
as long as the person
was important to me.

435
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:42,708
I will pledge Mashiro
to you again.

436

No matter what she
has become, her life

437
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:48,833
is still precious to
me! Do you accept?

00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:53,166
[RED DRAGON] Indeed. I
acknowledge the equivalence.

You can't.

between the Red Dragon

and the Child of Contract...

Can you possibly remember

what the last thing
you said to me was?

Just be a good king, Ibuki.

449

before Qi Sha
Tian Ling's gaze.

Only the holy spirit's
glimmering light

455

can protect her in
this darkest of hours.
