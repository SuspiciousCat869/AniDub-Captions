[IBUKI]
I've decided.

00:00:16,333 --> 00:00:18,125
I've made my choice.

3
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:21,916
I know what I must protect.

4
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:25,041
And therefore...

00:00:26,958 --> 00:00:29,083
...who I have to sacrifice.

[BOY ORPHAN 1A]
Mashiro!

00:00:57,125 --> 00:00:59,083
When's the food gonna be ready?

9
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:00,583
[BOY ORPHAN 1B]
Yeah, I'm starving!

10
00:01:00,666 --> 00:01:03,291
Okay! It's just about done!

11
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:05,750
Why don't you guys help
and get the table set up?

Hey, stop!

Why would you
hit him like that, Kai?

16
00:01:24,416 --> 00:01:26,666
Because he was
asking for it, that's why!

17
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,458
You should have heard him.

18
00:01:28,541 --> 00:01:30,041
He was telling
all the other kids

19
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:32,083
that our country's
been defeated!

20
00:01:36,041 --> 00:01:38,583
[IBUKI] We hail from a
country known as Nil Kamui.

21
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:41,041
It is but a small island nation.

22
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:43,583
One day, we were invaded

23
00:01:43,666 --> 00:01:46,416
by the great ancient
country of Kouran.

24
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,333
And in their avarice, a third
of our land was pillaged.

25
00:01:52,541 --> 00:01:55,083
[IBUKI] D'natia,
an ally state to the east,

26
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:56,458
was quick to defend settlements

27
00:01:56,541 --> 00:02:00,541
where they had established
bases, but nothing more.

28
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:02,541
And like a sacrificial swine,

29
00:02:02,625 --> 00:02:05,875
Nil Kamui's land was
carved and slowly devoured

30
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:08,875
by the two infiltrating powers.

31
00:02:08,958 --> 00:02:11,583
Amidst it all,
the island's Red Dragon deity

32
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:13,875
was suddenly overcome
with madness,

33
00:02:13,958 --> 00:02:18,541
and began razing villages,
killing indiscriminately.

34
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:21,250
We can't just give up
and surrender, Ibuki.

35
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:23,666
Our parents died for this land!

36
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,875
You expect me
to forget them?

37
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:27,416
[IBUKI] There are better
ways to remember them

38
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,958
than lashing out.

39
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,416
Well? Come on.

40
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,291
He still shouldn't
have said that stuff.

Fine, I was wrong. Sorry.

00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:50,458
I was thinking. You're going
to the big market festival

46
00:02:50,541 --> 00:02:52,416
to get supplies tomorrow, right?

47
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,250
How 'bout I go with you?

That's a great idea.

It's just that, um...

50
00:02:58,416 --> 00:03:01,666
Ah, there's going to be a lot
to carry, so I'll come, too.

51
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,833
Why? I can handle it
all by myself.

Well, the more
the merrier, right?

into it, you lazy bums!

No wonder your people
do nothing but complain.

against the Red Dragon.

No, Lady Kohkaku!

Then get ahead.

I've received word
that a new expedition

will soon be dispatched from
Kouran in search of our prey.

00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:15,541
Then we will double our
efforts to find the beast

00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:17,041
before they do.

76
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:19,208
We'll be branded incompetent
if they make the discovery.

Fellow countrymen or no,
they will not take what is ours.

We are the true
rulers of this island.

you came all this way.

I'm glad you did.

sounds interesting.

But of course.

I thought you would find
a task such as this

Oh, Fugaku!

100
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:24,583
Why did you
lower your weapon?

101
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:26,083
Because while I
train with a sword,

102
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:29,125
I have no interest
in actually fighting.

Should have known.
You'll never change.

104

I guess...

105
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:36,208
...that means you
don't want to follow

106
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:38,500
in your father's
footsteps either?

107

No. I don't see any reason to.

108
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:44,375
We don't need a king.

Perhaps.

110
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:48,166
I can understand
why you feel that way.

111

If an imperial like yourself
rose up and returned to power,

112
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:53,625
conflict and strife
would return as well.

You should take this with you.

It's just for decoration.

120
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,791
I know it would
please your father.

121

Maybe.

122
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:15,041
But isn't wearing
Ryugatou a bit dramatic?

123
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:17,666
Think of it as
dressing for the occasion.

124
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,333
Even if you don't wish
to become a king,

I'd like to see you
look like one.

going to the market as well?

Yes.

than throwing you into battle.

00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,000
Seriously.

163
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,666
I know it's quiet right now,

164
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,791
but the tension of war
could flare up at any moment.

165
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:16,625
[laughs]

166
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:18,500
Y'know, you really
are sweet, Meryl.

167
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:21,625
Thanks, but that's
not what I was going for.

168
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:22,958
All right.

169
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:24,833
What about this?

170
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:27,833
Are you really going
to join that expedition?

171
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:30,750
You realize they're trying
to find the Red Dragon.

172
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:32,208
Of course!

173
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:35,333
And I'm doing the same thing,
per the Black Dragon.

174
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:40,041
[SWEALLOW]
Don't look at me like that.

175
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:41,333
It'll be fun!

176
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:50,291
[MASHIRO]
Is that the best you can do?

177
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:52,291
I mean, I am buying in bulk.

178
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:54,458
So could you please
give me a better discount?

179
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:55,750
You're too much.

180
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:56,833
I give up.

Kouran's forces... Not today.

00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:22,875
What an absolutely
despicable slum this is.

188
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:24,750
If it weren't for
our hastened timetable,

189
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,000
we wouldn't have to
sully ourselves here.

190
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:28,708
[KOHKAKU] You know we
must find the Red Dragon

191
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:30,041
as soon as possible.

192
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:32,125
That's why we're
transporting the Dragon Eye.

193
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:34,500
It will allow us to share
our thoughts with the beast,

194
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:36,166
thus giving us an edge.

195
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,166
Try and persevere, Kohretsu.

196
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,875
[KANKOHRETSU] For you,
I shall endure, Lady Kohkaku.

[MASHIRO]
What's the matter?

199
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:56,833
[RED DRAGON] One who is fit
to be king of Nil Kamui.

Achieve that which you
desire in this world.

[IBUKI screams]

Now hear me!

205
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:34,958
Here before you is Kouran

housand!
Lady Kohkaku,
the Leader of Five

207
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:41,666
She has organized a force
to hunt the Red Dragon!

208
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:44,041
The very same monster
who laid waste

to the country he
had sworn to protect!

Such is her graciousness!

211
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,041
As you all know,

212
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:51,750
it was during the
last war the Red Dragon

213
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:55,708
began its brutal attacks
upon the people of Nil Kamui.

214
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:58,083
Should you be afraid? No!

215
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:00,041
For we possess the Dragon Eye,

216
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:01,833
which will aid us
in killing the beast

217
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:04,000
and returning peace
to this land!

[VILLAGERS muttering]

And with that...

220
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:17,541
Excuse me, little boy.

221
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:20,458
Are you referring to me?

00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:25,541
Of course, you stand out
like a sore thumb.

223
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:26,916
That sword you're holding...

224
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,291
Don't you know our peace treaty

225
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:31,041
forbids the people of
Nil Kamui from wearing them?

226
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,500
This island is now under
the protection of Kouran.

227
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:34,791
Isn't that great?

228
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:36,833
There's no need
to carry weapons.

229
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:39,541
[IBUKI]
I mean no offense.

230
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,125
It's merely decorative.

231
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:43,041
[KOHKAKU] I'm not asking you
for the blade's purpose.

I'm telling you it doesn't
have one. Get rid of it.

Don't listen to her!

you cannot let go of Ryugatou!

It's the very soul
of our country,

we can't afford to lose it!

Swords are just hunks of iron.

You having trouble?

242
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,041
Is it really so important
you would let it lead you

all into early graves?

You can't!

It'll be fine.

[KOHKAKU]
Yes, it will be.

247

After all,
having pride is meaningless

if you can't defend it.

What is it?

need a king anymore, but...

[KOHKAKU] Can't bring
yourself to part with it?

you'd make a nice assistant.

This pledge...

322
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:44,666
By forming a contract with you,
will I be able to save everyone?

323
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,458
Save Mashiro?

324
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:51,208
Indeed.

325
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:55,000
If that is what you desire,
it will be done.

326
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:57,541
[IBUKI]
All right.

327
00:18:57,625 --> 00:19:00,375
I want to change the world.

328
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:01,958
Please!

329
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:04,041
[RED DRAGON]
I have heard your wish.

330
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:06,750
It shall be granted.

331
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:12,166
[screaming]

332
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:17,416
Am I... going to die?

333
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:22,541
I promise. You won't!

334
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:23,666
[MASHIRO]
Ibuki...

335
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,083
Hurry, Red Dragon!

336
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:28,458
Save her!
Don't let anybody else die!

337
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:35,541
What's happening?
This... isn't me!

338
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:37,958
[RED DRAGON] The offering
must be of equal value.

339
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:39,125
What?!

340
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:41,125
Only then will you
have what you desire.

341
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,875
No! Please stop!

342
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:48,416
What's wrong with me?

343
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,958
You made a pledge
to Red Dragon?

344
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:53,208
That's wonderful.

345
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:54,916
Mashiro...

346
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,166
[MASHIRO] This is what it means
to vow yourself to a dragon.

347
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,750
I'm so happy

348
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:04,916
that I'm able to offer
my life to you, Ibuki...

349
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,291
Children of contract
transform the souls

350
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:09,041
of those they hold dear
into a weapon

351
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:11,708
to save their world from crisis.

352
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:16,166
It's exactly how the legend
always said it would be.

353
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:19,000
[IBUKI]
Don't! I can't... Not this!

354
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:21,458
I beg you!
[sobbing]

355
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:24,291
[MASHIRO] It's all right.
Please don't cry.

356
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:27,500
No matter what happens,
I'll always support you.

357
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:33,541
[MASHIRO]
Just be a good king, Ibuki.

358
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:41,583
[screaming]

359
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:44,375
[RED DRAGON]
The pledge has been fulfilled.

360
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,291
[IBUKI screams]

361
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:48,791
[RED DRAGON]
You shall be recognized

362
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:52,083
as Nil Kamui's
Child of Contract.

363
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:58,750
This is where you were hiding?

364
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:17,375
[KANKOHRETSU]
How are you... so strong...?

365
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:21,708
[IBUKI, RED DRAGON]
Silence!

366
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,125
[IBUKI, RED DRAGON] By the oath
between the Red Dragon

367
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:27,208
and the Child of Contract.

368
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:31,333
[IBUKI, RED DRAGON]
Perish!

369
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:38,625
[KANKOHRETSU]
The dragon's fire!

370
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:48,833
And we're done!

371
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:50,875
We'll have to settle this
another time.

372
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:59,041
Those flames... I see.

373
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:02,166
[SWEALLOW]
I think I'm starting to get

374
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:04,500
why I was called in on this.

375
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:07,750
Can't say the Black Dragon
doesn't have a sense of humor.

376
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:11,375
[LOU CHUN WAH] It seems we've
found an imperial, my lord.

377
00:22:11,458 --> 00:22:14,375
The royal blood courses
throughout that child's body.

378
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:15,958
[QI SHA TIAN LING]
Indeed it does.

379
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:18,458
I imagine it's delicious.

380
00:22:18,541 --> 00:22:19,750
As do I.

381
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:22,458
We never expected
to find such prey here.

382
00:22:35,541 --> 00:22:39,708
[KAI crying]

383
00:22:45,875 --> 00:22:48,125
[EYKHA]
Did Mashiro not survive?

384
00:22:49,291 --> 00:22:50,500
[IBUKI]
Who are you?

385
00:22:50,583 --> 00:22:54,583
[EYKHA] My name is Eykha.
I'm a revolutionary.

386
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:56,666
And who are you?

387
00:22:56,750 --> 00:23:00,166
My name's... Ibuki.

388
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:01,833
I'm this land's...

389
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,208
[IBUKI]
Mashiro...

390
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,916
[IBUKI]
For you...

391
00:23:15,708 --> 00:23:18,250
I will become
king of this island.

392
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:35,333
[NARRATOR]
Act Two: Antinomy.

393
00:23:35,416 --> 00:23:38,166
The powerful members of the
combined expedition appear

394
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,250
and make their presence felt.

395
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:41,750
In order to save a life,

396
00:23:41,833 --> 00:23:44,333
another friend
must be sacrificed.
