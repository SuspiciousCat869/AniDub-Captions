The Dragon's Claw.

I hope so, but I
do have my doubts.

Doubts? What do you mean?

13
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:59,125
As long as Inori's around, the
dragon will continue to revive.

14
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:01,833
So even if we manage to
defeat the dragon with this,

15
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:03,833
it'll all be for nothing.

16
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:05,250
But maybe doing so...

17
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:08,708
...is the key to bringing
Red Dragon back to sanity?

18
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:11,666
And if so, the person
who wields this weapon

19
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,708
should be someone
related to Red Dragon.

20

to entrust the

she's no longer with us.

Ah, Byakuei.

could possibly be launched?

Either way, deploying it
doesn't happen so easily.

Wait here for me.

Red Dragon.

00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,375
You will hear me.

[INORI]
Hello there, Dear Brother.

167
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,791
[IBUKI] I'm sorry I
couldn't protect you.

168
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:53,750
But we need to put an
end to this already.

169
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:56,041
This is not the
behavior of a king.

170
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:59,500
A king does whatever
a king wants to do.

Dear Brother.

Inori!

173

If you die and become
a Returned One,

174
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:07,500
then you'll go back
to being the kind,

175
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:09,958
wonderful brother
I used to like.

176
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:13,125
What a plan! Why didn't
I figure that out before?

177
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:15,208
It's just ingenious, right?

178
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:16,625
[IBUKI gasps]

00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:31,333
Ka Grava! What are you doing?!

183
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:33,791
[KA GRAVA laughs]
Whatever I can.

184
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:36,541
I'm pretty sturdy, you know.

185
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:42,250
I... I can't control it!

186
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:44,875
Whoa! Hold on!
What are you doing?!

187
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:46,958
Whatever I use falls apart.

188
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:48,875
But at the very moment
that happens,

189
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,875
I can draw out all of its power.

190
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:53,625
And that goes for everything,
even a warship like this.

191
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:55,125
Ah! No! Please!

192
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:58,333
My clan put over 100 years
into the building of this ship!

What?!

New things are only born into
this world out of destruction!

196

[BYAKUEI] You're planning
to expend this ship

197
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:08,041
just for that one moment?

198
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:10,291
That's the sin we
as humans hold.

199
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:12,208
The price that we have to pay.

200
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:14,583
Hm? Wait. Now I get it.

201
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:19,041
I think that's what my curse has
been about this entire time.

I believe we need to actually
survive in order for you

208
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:34,083
to be properly punched, Sir

that Lou, Ka Grava,

they've sacrificed
many precious things.

to lose anything.

I tried my best not
to take anyone's life

But I've learned that...

308
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:50,708
by doing so, I've simply lived

precious from someone else.

[INORI whimpers]

323
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:35,291
[IBUKI]
Listen to me, Eykha.

324
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:36,625
[EYKHA]
Mm.

325
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:39,291
[IBUKI] I'm going to do
something horrible to you.

326
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:41,375
You probably won't
forgive me for this.

327
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:44,583
[EYKHA]
Ibuki.

328
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:46,541
It's okay.

329
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:50,125
[IBUKI]
Even then, I will protect you.

330
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:52,333
[EYKH groans]

331
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:04,000
Inori! I promise you!

332
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:05,458
How could you?

333
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:08,666
I refuse to repeat the horrible
things you went through!

334
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:09,875
No.

335
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:11,875
[IBUKI] I'll make a
country without sorrow!

336
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:15,833
Brother, please. Don't do this!

337
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:23,833
[INORI screams]

338
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:27,875
Sleep, Inori. Good night.

339
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:32,291
My Dear... Brother.

340
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:40,375
Not too bad of an ending at all.

341
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:44,000
I will reward you for all
your deeds in these matters.

342
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:45,500
[SWEALLOW]
Uh, if you're thinkin' about

343
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:48,625
lifting my curse, it's okay.
Don't worry about it.

344
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:50,083
[BLACK DRAGON]
Oh?

345
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:52,250
[SWEALLOW] This "curse" of
breaking in order to create,

346
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:55,458
is something that we
as humans must bear.

347
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:59,375
And so I want to see exactly
what the future holds in store.

348
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:01,708
[MERYL cries]

[SWEALLOW grunting]

350
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:06,500
Uh! Sir Sweallow.

351
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:11,666
Uh? Well, looks like
I'm not done here yet.

352
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:14,250
Black Dragon still wants
me to live, it would seem.

353
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:15,708
[MERYL sobs]

354
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:17,791
[SWEALLOW gasps]

355
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:19,083
You...

356
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:21,166
[cries] ...low life!

357
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,333
[SWEALLOW yelps]
Ouch!

358
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:24,625
--[MERYL] Horrible!
--[SWEALLOW groaning]

359
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:25,916
--Selfish!
--[SWEALLOW groaning]

360
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,041
--Low life!
--[SWEALLOW groaning]

361
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:37,625
[LOU]
Huh?

362
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:46,208
[LOU gasps]

363
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:53,875
[QI SHA TIAN LING] It looks like
we can have fun again, Lou.

364
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:58,291
Indeed, my lord. [laughs]

365
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:07,500
[BYAKUEI] Our spiritual
mother has reviewed

366
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:10,333
and sanctioned Nil Kamui's
proposed new system.

367
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:12,541
[SIMEON] We were finally
able to receive approval

368
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:14,000
from our country as well.

369
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:16,500
And now we can focus
on its restoration.

370
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:18,791
[BYAKUEI] So. With that,
may we consider it final

371
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:21,041
that both D'natia and
Kouran officially

372
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:23,250
approve of the new king?

373
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:26,125
Yes. There are no objections
from the council.

374
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:30,000
Now then, I believe it's time
to bring in the new king-to-be.

375
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:30,916
[smack]

376
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,708
Uh. I'm sorry.

377
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:35,125
But, Ibuki has requested

378
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:38,666
that we briefly delay
the crowning ceremony.

379
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:48,541
Okay, then I will
offer you the life

380
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:51,083
of the one I hold most precious.

381
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:53,916
But I want you to keep
a promise for me.

382
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,750
I want you to take
a part of the life

383
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:58,750
that Val has remaining
and give it to Eykha.

384
00:21:58,833 --> 00:22:00,083
Can you do that?

385
00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:03,166
[RED DRAGON] I can.
But doing so would mean

386
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:05,208
that two lives that
were once separate

387
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:08,041
will come together as one anew.

388
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:10,083
Even if she gains a new life,

389
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:12,666
her soul will not be
the same as before,

390
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:15,166
both in memory and in mind.

391
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,791
Knowing that this
would be the outcome,

392
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:20,250
do you still wish to proceed?

393
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:23,708
Both Eykha and Val have
little time left to live.

394
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:27,166
If I offer Eykha
as a sacrifice,

395
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:29,125
I can protect her.

396
00:22:29,208 --> 00:22:31,291
Even if it turns out
that Eykha won't be

397
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:34,125
the same person
I know right now.

398
00:22:34,208 --> 00:22:36,541
I want her to live!

399
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:46,708
Last of the Dragon Shrine
Maidens. Arise and awaken.

400
00:22:46,791 --> 00:22:51,250
I have bestowed upon
you a new body and soul.

401
00:22:52,583 --> 00:22:55,875
[EYKHA]
How odd. I feel like...

402
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:58,541
Like I need to see someone?

403
00:22:58,625 --> 00:23:02,333
Then trust your feelings and go.

404
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:10,958
I know.

405
00:23:12,291 --> 00:23:16,125
[IBUKI panting]

406
00:23:19,916 --> 00:23:23,458
[EYKHA] That I'll travel
with you again someday.
