Yes. Over the last few days,

gone extinct.

It's possible that our State

And if it is, then what you're

Soon, the flow of water,
our crops and livestock,

and even the air we breathe
will be affected.

and the Imperial.

22

Shuka immediately.

Uh!

31
00:01:46,083 --> 00:01:48,541
[ULRIKA] The name of
this island is Nil Kamui.

32
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:50,250
Three years ago, it was invaded

33
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:53,041
by the great ancient
country of Kouran.

34
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:56,916
Despite being Nil Kamui's ally,
our homeland of D'natia

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,666
maintained a neutral stance and
avoided the conflict entirely.

36
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,083
As the Seven Year War
came to a close,

37
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:04,916
the land returned
to a state of peace

38
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,291
under the rule of the
two foreign powers.

39
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:10,541
With D'natia monitoring
Kouran's occupation.

40
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:12,750
But even with the
current arrangement,

41
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:15,916
this country must one day
return to its rightful owners.

42
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Holy Era 285, October.

43
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:23,458
Nil Kamui is about to be
engulfed in conflict once again.

44
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:57,291
[MERYL]
That's strange.

45
00:03:57,375 --> 00:04:00,458
You said these were found next
to Bishop Enumael's body?

46
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:02,041
[ULRIKA]
That's correct. You see,

47
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:04,000
these are the remnants
of a Holy Spirit,

48
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:06,916
a seal that's given by the
church to protect its bearer.

49
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,083
I assume Sir Sweallow
never got one because

50
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:10,208
he has you as a partner,

51
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:11,916
so he wouldn't need
the extra care.

52
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,083
More like he never got one
because it's so valuable

53
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:15,333
that he'd just sell it.

Uh. No. I mean, the Returned One

62
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:35,583
is responsible for
killing the bishop.

63
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:37,250
[KA GRAVA]
It would provide motivation

64
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:40,125
for Inori and the others
to suddenly disappear.

65
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:41,666
Well at least any implications

66

directed at Kouran
are now put to rest.

But it doesn't solve
the big issue.

Our two nations would attack
each other for any offense.

Which is just what Agito wants.

You'll have to excuse
my forwardness,

00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:59,125
but it is quite suspicious
that our bishop was killed

as you arrived in Haiga.

toward something.

Whatever it is, it involves
the imperial children as well.

[BYAKUEI] You mean the one that
united us with the revolution?

105
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,208
We believed if the three

for a common goal, they
would find peace eventually.

But considering the

00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:24,416
Yeah. That's it.

159
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,083
Don't make me laugh.

160
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:28,500
I can't blame you for
falling madly in love

161
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:29,041
with my dear brother.

162
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:30,375
That's a lie!

163
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:32,166
But the truth is he'll never
return your feelings

164
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,083
because you're merely
an attendant to him.

165
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:35,916
Which is why he won't
sacrifice you.

166
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,708
A relationship like that
isn't worth anything

167
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:38,916
to the Red Dragon.

168
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,583
No. That's not why.

169
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:43,000
[INORI] 
You understand?

170
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:44,625
No matter how it happens,

171
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:47,500
your death will be pitiful
and mean nothing!

172
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:49,875
[laughs]

173
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:51,916
You know what, brother?
You should just kill her.

174
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
It's all she has
to look forward--

175
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:54,625
That is enough!

176
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:57,666
Eykha. Go back to Ka Grava.

177
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:01,458
[EYKHA] You also refused to kill
me the last time I asked you to.

178
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,750
Is it because what
she said is true?

179
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:06,916
You think my life is worthless?

180
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,750
Eykha...

181
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:16,083
[EYKHA cries]

182
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:17,333
[IBUKI] 
I'm sending you away

183
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:20,416
because I don't
consider you my blade.

184
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,666
[INORI chuckles]

185
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:29,291
[IBUKI] All I really
want is to protect you.

186
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:34,041
But I know I don't have
the right to do that.

187
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:37,458
Ibuki!

188
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:43,708
[LOU] This new arm
is quite impressive.

189
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:46,583
[KA GRAVA] That's the best
Wu Xhing Ti that Kouran makes.

190
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:49,791
It's the least I could provide
after what you've given me.

191
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:51,375
[LOU]
And what is this?

192
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:54,333
That would be
the Dragon's Claw.

193
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:56,583
[LOU] 
If I had to guess,

194
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:59,083
I'd say that's our best hope in
the fight against Red Dragon.

195
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:02,166
[KA GRAVA]
Hm... It's rather unlike you

196
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,916
to show interest in someone
else's belongings.

197
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
You're right. How
unbecoming of me.

198
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:11,458
[SWEALLOW] 
Hey, all right.

199
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:13,708
Looks like your operation
was a complete success.

200
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:14,875
You like it?

201
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:17,041
[SWEALLOW]
Uh. Yeah, sure. [clear throat]

202
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:19,583
So the combined expedition
was just a waste of time.

203
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:21,916
Because each country had
its own selfish goals

204
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,166
rather than interest
in working together.

205
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,833
Uh! But all that political
mumbo jumbo

206
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:28,500
doesn't have anything
to do with us.

207
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:29,583
Am I right?

208
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:31,541
Yes, you are. We were
given a mission

209
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,416
and we should see it
through to the end.

210
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,750
Then it's really up to us.

211
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:36,250
Indeed.

212
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:37,625
--Find and kill Red Dragon.
--We have to protect Ibuki.

213
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:39,333
[BOTH]
Mm?!

214
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:41,416
Sorry, I must have misheard.

215
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,875
What is it you
think we should do?

216
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:44,708
[SWEALLOW] Depending on how
the meeting in Shuka goes,

217
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:46,916
Ibuki could be in
serious danger.

218
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,625
We have to keep him safe.

219
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:50,541
[LOU] But the whole
purpose of the expedition

220
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:52,083
was to find Red Dragon.

221
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:54,583
Although... that was
always just a front.

222
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:57,333
In reality, you and I
were supposed to kill it.

223
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:58,750
I won't deny that.

224
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:01,208
And if we could pull off
getting rid of him, honestly,

225
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:03,583
my life would only be
better for having done so.

226
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:05,500
But if you were to ask
me whether I thought

227
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:07,875
doing something to make my
life better in exchange

228
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:10,125
for letting a kid's life
be ruined was worth it,

229
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:13,000
my answer would be no.

230
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:15,583
Truthfully speaking, I've never
been attached to anything

231
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:16,958
in my whole life.

232
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:20,041
And that applies to the
mission we were given, too.

233
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:22,208
[QI SHA TIAN LING]
He is an enigma, isn't he, Lou?

234
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:24,291
However, if we
stay by his side,

235
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:26,666
I will be able to consume
both the Imperials

236
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,208
and the Black Dragon Knights.

237
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:29,791
[grunts] Watch yourself.

238
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:31,541
I'm pretty sure I've
told you this before,

239
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:33,916
I can't touch people
like it's no big deal.

240
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,375
[LOU] 
Sir Sweallow.

241
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:38,541
I will kill Red Dragon if
it's the last thing I do.

242
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:40,375
I don't understand you, Lou.

243
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:42,750
What's the point in pursuing
this thing so doggedly

244
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:44,416
it practically becomes
a vendetta?

245
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,791
Just why?

246
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:47,125
--There's gotta be a reason.
--[LOU] That is akin to

247
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:48,833
asking me why my
heart beats within

248
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,458
my breast without provocation.

249
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:52,041
[SWEALLOW] 
I think I understand.

250
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:53,541
You're my total opposite. 

251
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:55,833
You get attached to anything
that's given to you.

252
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:57,958
Then again. It's not
like I didn't realize

253
00:11:58,041 --> 00:11:59,625
that about you back
when we first met,

254
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:01,708
so it's not really surprising.

255
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:03,208
Truth be told,

256
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:05,500
I think I was hoping that
sentiment might rub off on me.

257
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:07,708
Guess I was expecting too much.

258
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:11,041
[LOU] Oh, I'm more than willing
to meet your expectations.

259

Right now's fine.

I interrupting something?

anything I can do

for you, great Leader
of Ten

265

[BYAKUEI] Not quite. You have
a message from the Líng Mu.

[SWEALLOW groans]

[ULRIKA] Are you all
right, Sir Sweallow?

00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:35,000
Oh, man, I swear this
isn't what it looks like!

00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:36,166

Uh!

271
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,541
It's all right. I know you're
planning to go help Ibuki,

272
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,708
even though it's going to
inhibit the possibility

of having your curse lifted.

about this? Man!

--Uh!
--[ULRIKA gasps]

277
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:50,625
[ULRIKA] Are you sure this
is what you want to do?

278
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:53,416
You've suffered more
than anyone ever should.

279
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,083
Even as a child.

280
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:56,375
Yeah, maybe I have.

281
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:58,375
But that's exactly
why I can't stand by

282

and do nothing when I
know a child is suffering.

Be careful.

What were you about to do?

286
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:19,291
Kill that Black Dragon
Knight in the open?

287
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:21,083
Would that be a problem?

288
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:23,583
[BYAKUEI] Well, it would give
some credence to the rumors.

289
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:26,125
The way I heard it, you became
a cold-blooded assassin

290
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:27,916
after you stole that
sword from a general

291
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,583
who had taken a liking to you.

292

[KOURAN GENERAL]
From what I was told,

293
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:36,333
it has something to
do with the Líng Mu.

294
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:39,250
The blade is so sharp that the
previous owner couldn't resist

295
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:42,083
the temptation of testing
it on his subordinates.

296
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:45,708

a good idea to me!

Allegedly, you were charmed

by the sword and
became its slave.

something so ridiculous.

Honestly, General, you should
try to be more skeptical.

Regarding your message
from the Líng Mu...

You're wrong.

[ULRIKA] I had hoped
