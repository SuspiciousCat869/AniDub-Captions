[SWEALLOW] When you're

00:01:05,125 --> 00:01:07,666
it's only natural that
people come to fear you.

are your parents.

But it can't be helped when
everything you touch breaks.

[SWEALLOW] I tried to

And no one ever bothered
to read to me.

11
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:35,583
Sometimes I wondered what would
happen if I used someone.

12

If I treated them like a tool.

[SWEALLOW]
The Clazzvali family

was one of the

Hey, Shark.

Don't worry, I'm not
going to touch you.

18
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:18,375
[SWEALLOW]
It was when I lost my friend

19
00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:20,750
that I finally began
to understand.

20
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:22,958
Even if I didn't touch
the things I cared about,

21
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:25,083
they were still gonna break.

22
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:30,875
[SWEALLOW] That had always
been the reality of my life.

23
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,791
[ULRIKA] I'd heard rumors

But if he succeeds
in his mission,

he won't have to suffer anymore.

27
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:59,291
You mean because of his contract
with the Black Dragon.

28
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:01,666
I just hope his bad habit
doesn't come out.

[SWEALLOW] The name of this

31
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:09,875
It's currently caught between
the ancient country of Kouran

32

Which is where I

When he was ten years old,

Supposedly, they, along with

even though it's your only
hope of getting out of here.

Because your kindness
would cloud your judgment.

[IBUKI gasps]

165
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:41,041
[HIEN] You have to offer
me to Red Dragon...

166
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:44,375
before that giant
kills all of you.

Yes. Hear me, Red Dragon.

168
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:49,916
I've given you my pledge.

Now unleash your
flame to save us!

After all this time.

Through death, you will finally
be giving my life meaning again.

Why isn't the Dragon

Of all times.

184
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:30,458
[SWEALLOW]
Simple.

185
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:34,666
His life isn't considered
to be of equal value.

186
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:37,958
Or at least, that's what I
think his silence means.

187
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:39,750
So you mean...

188
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:43,916
You're saying Hien's life
wasn't precious enough to me?

[KA GRAVA]
Wait. Where are you going?

Don't you guys
worry about it.

I'm gonna take
care of everything.

[SWEALLOW]
Talk about a mess.

193
00:15:57,291 --> 00:16:00,333
This isn't how I wanted
things to go down.

194
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:02,833
I knew Hien couldn't
have been a Returned One.

195
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:04,250
The Returned Ones haven't moved

196
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:07,333
since I used the
Black Dragon's Scale.

197
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:10,541
But there's no way I can
tell them the truth.

198
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:11,916
That Hien's death,

199
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,625
that all of what's happening
now, is my sin to bear.

[MERYL]
Please don't touch anything.

201

[SWEALLOW]
C'mon, I just want a cup of tea!

202
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:31,041
That's a shame.

203
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:33,000
Seeing as how everything
in this mansion

204
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:34,666
has been seized by
the Sherbet Company,

205
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:37,875
I'm afraid that's
strictly forbidden.

206

You know, I really appreciate
that you're doing all of this.

You're just about the only

the bankrupt Clazzvali Family.

209

But then you are the creditor.

Not to change the
subject, sir.

211

But it's about time you
got to your meeting.

[SWEALLOW] Man, are you sure
I have to go to this thing?

[SWEALLOW]
Okay, fine. I'm on my way.

[BLACK DRAGON]
So that's what it is.

217
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:39,958
It would appear you carry a
curse of ruination with you.

00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:43,041
[SWEALLOW] That's correct,
Black Dragon. And it's awful.

219
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:46,333
[BLACK DRAGON] Have you come
to ask me to remove it?

220

If it's possible, then yes.

As you might imagine,

222
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,125
it's just absurd trying
to live life this way.

223
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:56,458
The Red Dragon, from Nil Kamui,

224
00:17:56,541 --> 00:18:00,458
has succumbed to madness
and lashed out in violence.

225
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:04,000
The Seven Dragons
cannot abide this.

You will join in their search,
and kill the red one.

229
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,375
[SWEALLOW]
And once I've done that,

230
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:17,625
you'll free me from
this stupid existence?

231
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:21,291
That is correct.
Now, if you agree,

00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:25,500

with that particular

However, his wielding of
it was rather unique.
