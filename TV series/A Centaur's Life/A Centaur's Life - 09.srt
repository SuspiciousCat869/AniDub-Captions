I'm looking.

00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,416
Oh, you got a smartphone, huh?

3
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,791
Yeah, it's so cool.

4
00:01:45,875 --> 00:01:48,750
Now, here, let's see.

5
00:01:48,833 --> 00:01:50,125
[HIMENO]
Is this it?

6
00:01:52,791 --> 00:01:55,125
[JEAN] Ipomoea lobate,
the firecracker vine,

7
00:01:55,208 --> 00:01:56,958
blooms only in
the deepest jungles.

8
00:01:57,041 --> 00:01:59,041
Combined with other
all-natural ingredients,

9
00:01:59,125 --> 00:02:01,625
the vine's healing properties
make Ipomoea Queen

10
00:02:01,708 --> 00:02:03,250
perfectly suited to
support good health

11
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:06,000
and ease stress brought on
by today's hectic world.

12
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:07,791
Ads like this are so cheesy.

13
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:10,291
I've been seeing this
frog guy a lot lately.

14
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:12,583
I guess he's some
kind of celebrity.

15
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:15,000
You probably don't want
to call him a "frog guy."

16
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:16,625
What's the right term, then?

17
00:02:16,708 --> 00:02:18,458
I would say amphibianfolk.

18
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:21,000
Jeez, that's kind of a mouthful.

19
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:25,125
I think I would call him
a Frenchman. It's accurate.

20
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:28,541
Don't you know his background?
He's a French citizen.

21
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:33,583
[SUU] One day, when
he was a young child,

22
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:38,333
Jean Rousseau lost
consciousness in the jungle.

23
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:42,041
He was found by
French missionaries.

24
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:45,333
They educated him in
a mammalian society.

25
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,041
[TEACHER A]
His abilities far surpass

26
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:50,750
those of average children.

27
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:53,958
[TEACHER B] If that's the case,
then perhaps we should test him.

28
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:01,458
[SUU] He began working
for a small trading firm

29
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:03,083
in South America.

30
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:05,666
His academic background
bolstered his success,

31
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,541
and eventually he
purchased the company

32
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:11,333
and became its president.

33
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:14,291
And that's his story.

34
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:16,958
Why would someone like that
wanna star in commercials?

35
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:20,041
His work has always gotten
him a lot of media exposure.

36
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:22,791
Especially his involvement
with minority rights.

37
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:24,541
He sounds like
an incredible guy.

38
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:26,125
Are all amphibianfolk
that smart?

39
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:28,041
No, that's an
overgeneralization.

40
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:29,916

[HIMENO yelps]

43
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:38,458
Ten more seconds.

44
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:41,125
I'm sure the amphibianfolk
have their share of idiots, too.

45
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:43,625
Every race has its
morons and geniuses.

[MANAMI]
Sorry to interrupt,

47
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:47,583
but did I overhear you
discussing Jean Rousseau?

48
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:50,708
Well, this is perfect timing.
I've got some exciting news.

49
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:53,333
Mr. Rousseau is going to
come here and speak to us.

50
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:56,708
You four could form a committee,
get everything ready.

51
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:58,583
If you think that we're
right for the job...

52
00:03:58,666 --> 00:03:59,666
Hey!

53
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,833
I apologize. Did I say
something wrong?

54
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:05,125
I'm so glad you're
willing to help out.

55
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:06,500
Well, this should
be interesting.

56
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:09,500
There's never a dull moment
around here lately.

57
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:31,583
Pardon me, sir. It seems
Mr. Rousseau has arrived.

58
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:33,416
[PRESIDENT]
Oh.

59
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:39,625
[EXEC]
This way.

60
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:40,916
[JEAN]
Thank you.

61
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,541
Welcome, Mr. Rousseau.

62
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,750
[PRESDENT] I was always told
that it was poor manners

63
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:52,083
to shake hands with gloves on.

64
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:58,750
[JEAN]
I understand, but my hands...

65
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:34,041
My hand isn't dirty.
There is no need to clean it.

66
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,833
Are you sure?

67
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,458
Obviously, you still have
a great deal left to learn.

68
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:49,583
The meeting ran longer
than we expected,

69
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:51,958
so there's no time
to take a break now.

70
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:53,333
A change of clothes
is waiting for you

71
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:54,916
on the airplane, however.

72
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,250
Good, thank you.

73
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:57,625
[SECRETARY A]
I've also prepared the documents

74
00:05:57,708 --> 00:05:59,375
necessary for the settlement.

75
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:01,458
There are four matters that
will require your attention

76
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:03,166
before the end of the day.

77
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,250
The weather report is clear.

78
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:08,750
Our estimated flight
time is three hours.

00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:14,375
I have a helicopter standing
by for you at the airport.

00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:16,375
Good, thanks. Is that it?

82
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:19,583
There are no further plans for
the day after this visit, right?

83
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:22,125
Yes, that's correct, but
we need to be careful.

84
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:23,500
It's a very busy week,

85
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,375
and if anything carries over
into the next few days,

86
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:28,250
we'll have a lot of
things to rearrange.

87
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:30,833

schedule tomorrow morning?

88
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:33,750

[FROG A, FROG B yelling]

90
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:56,458
I noticed you're dressed
rather unconventionally.

91
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:58,125
You find it strange?

92
00:07:58,208 --> 00:07:59,458
Interesting coming from someone

93
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:01,958
who regularly wears
mammalian clothing.

94
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:04,250
True, I wear suits for work.

95
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:07,250
It's a gesture of respect to
the people I do business with.

96
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:10,916
That, on the other
hand, is battle attire.

97
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,291
[LEADER]
Naturally.

98
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:14,208
Our tribe is
constantly struggling

99
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:16,833
to fend off our enemies.

100
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,250
here is something
going on here,

101
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,708
and I would like some answers.

102
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:23,000
First, who are these enemies

103
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:24,958
you say the tribe
has been fighting?

104
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:27,333
And second, where did you
come by this battle gear?

105
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:30,083
Who in the world
provided it for you?

106
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:33,791
Who are we fighting?
Only those who deserve it.

107
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:36,791
People who attack our
brethren without reason.

108
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:38,875
As for the gear we've received,

109
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:42,750
our god told me he would
lend me the power I needed.

110
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:45,333
He is not like their
useless, invisible god

111
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:47,708
who does nothing for them.

112
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:51,833
I don't doubt your devotion

113
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:54,375
to protecting the tribe
from outside attack,

114
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:57,750
but it's important not
to act recklessly.

115
00:08:57,833 --> 00:09:00,416
Remember, we must do
whatever is necessary

116
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,791
to coexist peacefully with
the mammalian peoples.

117
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:10,416
If we fail in that, it is we
who will be destroyed, not them.

118
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:14,125
Also, our god truly exists.

119
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:18,666
He is as real as you and I are.
But he is not a selfless deity.

120
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,000
He does not act
according to our wishes.

121
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:25,250
He isn't motivated by care for
us, but by his own interests.

122
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:28,041
How dare you!
Insolent blasphemer!

123
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:31,541
That isn't to say I don't
respect our god, because I do.

124
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:35,666
However, that doesn't change
the truth of who he is.

00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:42,541
[LEADER]
Listen to me.

126

You may not wish
to believe this,

127
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,916
but you have been
deceived by the mammalians

128
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,375
you have been living among.

129
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:50,166
They're not as strong as
they want us to think they are.

130
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,708
Yes, there are more of them,

131
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:53,791
and their technology
is more advanced.

132
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:56,166
But even so, our god
and his angels

133
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,583
are stronger than they
could ever hope to be.

134
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:00,458
Trust me. I've
seen it firsthand.

135
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:01,791
Yes!

136
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:04,000
And even if we don't have
our god's assistance,

137
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:06,750
we can never allow
ourselves to yield.

138
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:09,375
Whatever it takes, we must
reclaim our land and water

139
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:11,250
from their repulsive clutches.

140
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:15,500
We must fight them,
even if it costs us our lives.

141
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:19,791
Though, I don't really
expect you to understand.

142
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:22,833
You're practically a
mammalian yourself now.

00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:40,333
that may never have
existed in the first place?

146
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:43,958
That way of thinking is
mammalian, not amphibian.

147
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:46,625
It is poison to our kind.

Why isn't he able to see that?

very much, Mr. Rousseau.

The speech is done.
Is it ready?

153
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:14,416
It should be.

00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:21,458
Much better.

We thought you might enjoy
some tea from your homeland.

Where are they taking us?

Straight to Hell on Earth, kid.

Did we say you could stop?

[MAN D] Hey! We don't
take breaks around here!

177

Now, kid, get back to work!

[MAN E] Hey! Why does he
always get a bigger portion?

183
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:01,333
You'd be wise to take
what you're given.

184
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:03,875
Calm down. No need to
get worked up about it.

[MAN E growls]

Shut up.

[JAILER]
Enough, you filth.

188
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:09,708
The amount you get is
determined by body type.

Listening to you people talk
makes me sick to my stomach.

Every word out of your mouths

193
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:20,583
is full of jealousy
and prejudice.

194
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:34,625
Man, I sure am hungry.

195
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:36,333
Just let it go!

196
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:38,625
I sure could'a used
more food tonight,

197
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:41,875
but apparently they're saving
it all up to feed the livestock.

198
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:44,666
You and that corporal must
be pretty good buddies,

199
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,916
seeing as you're both
barnyard animals and all.

200
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,125
What?

201
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:50,083
[PRISONER A]
Get him! Make him hurt!

Stop it, please!
We're on the same side.

205
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:02,083
[I've got nothin' in
common with livestock!

206
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:04,750
What're you lookin' at, huh?

207
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:07,208
[PRISONER E]
Are you all right, child?

208
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:13,333
We're all prisoners, aren't we?

209
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:15,541
We shouldn't be
fighting each other.

210
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:17,708
Things may be changing,
but until recently,

211
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:20,541
discrimination based on
body type was the norm.

212
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:23,875
Of course, when you think about
it, not much is different.

213
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:25,958
Only now, it's the
government that's telling us

214
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:28,583
who's inferior and
who is superior.

215
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:32,333
It's a common theme in science
fiction books, right?

216
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:34,083
If only there were
no discrimination

217
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:35,375
based on body type,

218
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:38,208
then the whole world
would finally be at peace.

219
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:40,208
Isn't that probably true?

220
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:41,791
No, it's not.

221
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:46,333
Just think. Hair color,
skin color, nationality.

222
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:48,291
Tall or short, fat or skinny.

223
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:50,583
We're all different in some way.

224
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:51,958
And so long as that's true,

225
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:55,625
people will always cling
to their prejudices.

226
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:57,291
But that's awful.

227
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:00,166
Even if we all looked alike,

228
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,708
we'd find something
to fight about,

229
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:04,500
like whose clothing was better
or whose house was bigger.

230
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:06,708
That's just the
nature of humanity.

231

There's no way to fix it.

them, they'll kill him.

Why should we take
orders from him?

authority to boss us around?

or later, someone will kill me.
