so large and rounded.

accentuate those things.

Back then, nobles didn't
wash their hair much.

It is kind of a hassle
when it's long like this.

You can't
intentionally cut them.

131
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:37,958
It's seen as a form
of discrimination.

The implication is that
you're rejecting your own race.

Y'know, I'm surprised.

164
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:47,583
Doesn't look like enough food
for somebody your size.

165
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:49,625
Um, yeah.

166
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:51,500
I didn't know you
were a light eater.

167
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:52,833
What about you?

168
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:55,916
Do you eat the same things
you would in Antarctica?

169
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,166
I've been able to
acclimate my digestive system

170
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,541
to the food humans eat.

171
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:01,958
So, I can have most of
the same things you would.

[SUU] Although, the way
my mouth is designed,

So, I have to eat things
that I can swallow whole.

Oh, no, it looks fine.

Except for the peppers.

You're on a diet

Seeing as I'm not a teacher,

I won't take it away from you,
but if you're that hungry,

[school bell rings]

202

[KYOKO] I'm sure you've
heard this a bunch before,

203
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:09,083
but it's rare to see
a Japanese centaur

204
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:10,833
with red hair like yours.

205
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:12,625
Yeah, I know.

206
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:15,500
It actually caused
some trouble in middle school.

207
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:17,333
My teacher suspected
me of dying it,

208
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:21,125
and he wouldn't believe me when
I told him it was natural.

209
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:23,416
Wouldn't that be
considered discrimination?

210
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,208
[HIMENO] Yeah, he ended
up getting arrested.

211
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:27,875
Is it red because
you're half-Japanese?

212
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:29,166
No.

213

My mom's family has

for generations.

215

[NOZOMI]
Huh.

216
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:37,041
[HIMENO] There's a story
behind it and everything.

217
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:39,000
Interesting! A story?

218
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:41,583
[HIMENO] Well, I don't know
if "story" is the right word.

219
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:42,916
"Legend" might be better.

220
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,958
If you wouldn't mind,
I'd love to hear it.

221
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:49,000
Uh... Sure, why not?

222
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:51,750
One of my ancestors was
a princess who was kidnapped

223
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:54,291
by a southern barbarian.

224
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:56,250
Her siblings pursued
them relentlessly,

225
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:59,333
in hopes of saving her.

226
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:01,208
Their search took them
from Southern Europe

227
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:04,125
to Northern Europe
and on to Anatolia.

228
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:05,958
Eventually,
they found their sister

229
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:09,083
and returned with her to Japan.

230
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:11,708
But from then on,
she and all her descendants

231
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:13,750
had babies who were
born with red hair.

232
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,000
So, it does come
from having a mixed heritage.

233
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:19,708
The story about
the princess and the raid

234
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:21,750
on the barbarians is famous.

235
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:25,000
I had no idea you came from
such a distinguished family.

236
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:25,916
Not really.

237
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,541
All that was a long time ago.

238
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:30,166
My mom's dad was
an ordinary businessman.

239
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,333
You don't have
any historical documents?

240
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:33,791
I'm not sure.

241
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:35,458
If we did, I would've
seen them in the house

242
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:37,625
at some point, right?

243
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:39,666
[KYOKO]
Still, documentation or not,

244
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,583
the legend is really well known.

245
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:43,208
It's so amazing.

246
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:49,500
[KYOKO] The raiders
were set on their path.

247
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:52,375
They were determined to
bring the princess home.

248
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:54,958
No area of the continent
was safe from them.

249
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:04,875
[KYOKO]
The story goes...

250
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,291
[KYOKO] ...that they sank
a ship using nothing

251
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:11,208
but a single arrow.

252
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:14,416
Come on, that's ridiculous!

253
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,041
Yeah, you'd think so, right?

254
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:18,458
Apparently, there are some
records of it, though.

255
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:20,375
It's a remarkable story.

256
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:22,500
Regardless of whether
it's entirely true.

257
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:25,333
And there's more to it.

258
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:28,208
The raiders freed
slaves across the continent,

259
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:31,875
who then joined them until
they had formed a vast army.

260
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:33,666
With that army at their backs,

261
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:36,375
they were finally able
to rescue the princess.

262
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:39,875
And the culmination of

263
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:43,500
that fierce military
bloodline is this.

264
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:46,083

Well, to an extent, I guess.

got a bunch of attention

for an article he wrote as part
of an undercover investigation.

Since she started working
as his secretary,

320
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:54,791
he's been meeting
all his deadlines.

321
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,041
I don't know how she manages it,
but those are the kinds

322
00:13:57,125 --> 00:14:00,875
of results that I am
not going to argue with.

323
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:01,958
[KYOKO]
'Kay, Pops.

324
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:03,791
You can go ahead
and look it over again.

325
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:06,000
I fixed the typos
and spelling errors.

326
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:07,250
Yeah, okay.

327
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:10,458
And I thought I told you
not to call me Pops.

328
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:12,458
Anyway, why
no comments from that guy

329
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:16,333
at Library Paradise University?
You know, Professor Bibu.

330
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:18,916
I wanted some, but I
wasn't able to get an interview.

331
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:23,250
Hey! What? Who are you--?

332
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:28,166
Yes, hello.
Is this Professor Bibu's office?

333
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,833
[NARAKU]
Whoa, hold on!

334
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:31,458
Oh, yes. Absolutely.

335
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:34,666
I'm very impressed with the
professor's recent writings.

336
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,833
I agree completely!

337
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:37,875
Uh-huh.

338
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:40,625
The seminar was excellent.

339
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:44,416
In fact, I was hoping I could
hear the professor's opinion.

340
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:47,958
We'll need to
take a right when

341
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:50,166
we get to the next
corner, please.

342
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,875
Yes, that's perfect.

343
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:53,333
Okay.

344
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:55,833
Thank you so much for making
time to speak with me.

345
00:14:57,833 --> 00:14:59,750
[KYOKO]
Here. The professor's comments.

346
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:01,625
Right. Okay.

347
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:04,250
[KYOKO] Give me a sec and
I'll go put on some coffee.

348
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:05,666
You keep on writing.

349
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:06,750
[NARAKU sighs]

350
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:08,250
[KYOKO]
Hmm...

351
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:12,250
[KYOKO]
Is that the class president?

352
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:15,458
Weird. Why's she
dressed like that?

353
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:17,416
Is she cosplaying?

354
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,083
[NARAKU]
Hey, hurry up with the coffee.

355
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:21,541
[KYOKO]
Yeah, yeah.

356
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:24,750
What's up?
Something interesting out there?

357
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:27,791
[KYOKO] Well, I just saw a
friend of mine from school.

358
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:29,833
She was wearing
a priestess outfit,

359
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:32,583
and going into the crazy
neighbor lady's house.

360
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:34,333
You think maybe
this friend of yours is running

361
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:36,291
one of those curse
removal scams?

362
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:37,708
[KYOKO]
What?

363
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:39,375
Gonna tell me not to hang out
with someone like that?

364
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:42,625
No. I was gonna tell
you to hang out with her more.

365
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:44,833
Could be a good story.

366
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:46,416
[KYOKO]
Sorry.

367
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,625
I don't really think she's the
type to do that sort of thing.

368
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:52,166
This is it, the box
I was telling you about.

369
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,250
[MANAMI]
Mm...

370
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:55,500
I saw a medium
before I called you.

371
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:57,916
According to her,
the thing is cursed.

372
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,208
Right. Did the medium tell you
anything more about the curse?

373
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:02,791
She said it was so powerful,

374
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:04,375
she didn't think there was
anything that could be

375
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:06,000
done to remove it.

376
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:07,208
So, I'm supposed to leave it

377
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:10,000
in this spot to contain
the vengeful spirit.

378
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:13,000
I light candles and make
offerings every day, as well.

379
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:16,791
[WOMAN NEIGHBOR A] But its power
still seems to be leaking out,

380
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:20,291
infecting my house.
My cat went missing for a while.

381
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:23,375
I hear noises coming from
rooms I know are empty,

382
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:27,625
and sometimes, I can sense
a presence behind me.

383
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:30,125
[MANAMI]
She's got an active imagination.

384
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:31,750
Still...

385
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:33,333
I think I can help.

386
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:36,166
I'll do what I can to quiet the
box and then have it removed.

387
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:42,833
[MANAMI]
First, I'll purify the room

388
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:44,916
and exorcise any remaining evil.

389
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,583
Yes, thank you.
Please, go ahead.

390
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:50,125
May I ask you to step
outside the room while I work?

391
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:51,458
[WOMAN NEIGHBOR A]
Of course.

392
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:58,291
[sighs]

393
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:01,333
[MANAMI]
Be cleansed!

394
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:03,125
Be purified!

395
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:04,541
Be cleansed!

396
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:06,166
[MANAMI] I wonder what I should
make for dinner tonight.

397
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,375
I'm all finished in here.

398
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:12,583
[WOMAN NEIGHBOR A]
Thank you so much for your help!

399
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:14,416
Just doing my duty.

400
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,416
Now, about that
monetary offering.

401
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,333
[WOMAN NEIGHBOR A]
Oh, yes, of course.

402
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:22,416
Please accept this, and
reimbursement for the taxi.

403
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:26,125
[MANAMI sighs] I'll return later
to oversee to the box's removal.

404
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:27,166
[WOMAN NEIGHBOR A]
Thank you.

405
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,583
My home already
feels more peaceful.

406
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:31,833
[KYOKO]
Yes. Yes.

407
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:35,541
We're looking forward to working
with you again next month, too.

408
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:37,791
Sounds like
they're accepting it.

409
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:39,041
All right!

410
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:40,833
Well, that's one less
thing to worry about.

411
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:43,875
I deserve a reward.
Want to go grab some dinner?

412
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:45,291
We're not going anywhere.

413
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:46,375
Brother's getting back late,

414
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:48,000
and we should have
food for him here.

415
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:51,000
[NARAKU] Aw. You're always
so concerned about him.

416
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:53,208
What about your doting father?

417
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:55,833
[KYOKO] Shut up. I'm going
to go make dinner.

418
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:57,791
Then, you're going to eat it
and be grateful that you have

419
00:17:57,875 --> 00:17:59,541
such a wonderful daughter.

420
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:11,375
[CHIS snoring]

421
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:15,666
Hey, how'd it go?

422
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,666
You're taking dinner
duty tonight, Dad?

423
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,083
Sure am.

424
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:22,125
The kids exhausted themselves
playing and passed out.

425
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:24,125
And it sounded like
you'd be home late.

426
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:26,250
And the painting?

427
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:27,291
What?

428
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:29,625
Have you made
any progress on it?

429
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,541
Uh...

430
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:35,041
Actually, I seem to be in
a bit of a slump right now.

431
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:38,583
[MANAMI sighs]

432
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:43,625
[CHIS snoring]

433
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:45,000
[MANAMI]
Hey, Dad.

434
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:46,500
I don't know any more about
art than what I've read

435
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:50,916
in textbooks, but can you
really call yourself a painter?

436
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,333
That's a painful
question to hear

437
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:54,083
from your own daughter.

438
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:57,458
I know my painting doesn't put
food on the table, but still...

439
00:18:57,541 --> 00:19:00,625
It isn't about whether or not
it puts food on the table.

440
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:03,750
You're off work now,
and the kids are asleep.

441
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:07,875
If you're a painter, shouldn't
you be using this time to paint?

442
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:10,458
Well. A painting isn't something

443
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:13,708
you can just poke at when
you get a spare moment.

444
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,083
And besides, doesn't this

445
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:17,958
make your life easier?
Having dinner already done?

446
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:20,250
Have you read
Akootahgawa's "Hell Screen"?

447
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:24,166
In it a painter had to depict
his daughter being burned alive.

448
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,583
[MANAMI'S DAD] That's an awful
thing to have to do.

449
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:31,083
Both as a painter and a father.
How would that make you feel?

450
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:33,458
If I did that,
you'd hate me for it.

451
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:35,291
I would be angry, of course.

452
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:37,375
But still.

453
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:40,041
If you're going
to be a true artist,

454
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:42,333
something like that
shouldn't stop you.

455
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:45,916
Even if it's
in your spare moments,

456
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,250
and even if it makes your
daughter angry with you.

457
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:53,375
Paint fearlessly or
choose a different path.

458
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:55,458
You have to make a choice.

459
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:58,833
Be an artist.
Or be a good father.

460
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:05,750
Why does it have to be
either one or the other?

461
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:08,625
I don't think it's impossible
to be both those things.

462
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,333
Maybe it isn't, but
do you have the talent

463
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:14,000
necessary to be both?

464
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:16,458
I'm trying.

465
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:18,583
Right now, you're doing
two things halfway.

466
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:21,000
You're a part-time painter
and a part-time contractor,

467
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:24,041
so really, you're neither,
but what you are...

468
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:26,500
...is a lousy father
hoping to earn compensation

469
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:27,875
for your youngest daughter.

470
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:34,916
[CHIHO]
Hey. Sis.

471
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,958
Hey, Chi. Are you awake?

472
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:40,750
Hug! Hug!

473
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:42,416
Well. Anybody hungry?

474
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,541
Dad made dinner for us tonight.

475
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:46,291
[CHIS]
Yeah!

476
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:50,250
[HIMENO snores]

477
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:52,541
[NEWSCASTER]
Now for our next story,

478
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:55,541
The results of America's
presidential election are in...

479
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:58,125
She must have been tired.

480
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:00,458
If she were still Shino's age,
I wouldn't hesitate

481
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:03,208
to call this adorable.

482
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:06,750
Well, she really
is just a big child, huh?

483
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:08,041
Why does she
only snuggle up with you

484
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:09,750
like that and not me?

485
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:11,833
Because you're
just a big child, too.

486
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:14,666
[SOUTA groans]
C'mon, trade spots with me.

487
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,333
[RINO] You'll have to
ask Himeno about that.

488
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,500
[SOUTA]
Aw.

489
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:20,041
[BOY A]
Later!

490
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:22,416
--[BOY B] Bye!
--[BOY C] See you tomorrow!

491
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,541
[MOTHER A]
Excuse me!

492
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:28,041
[MOTHER A] I want to thank you
for all you've done for my boy.

493
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:30,916
No, really, it's nothing.

494
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,250
If you say that,

495
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:34,333
you don't realize just how
good a teacher you are.

496
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:35,791
I mean it.

497
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:38,166
He's never stuck with any
of his other lessons before.

498
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,875
This is the only class where
he's never missed a session.

499
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:42,166
Thanks.

500
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,333
[MOTHER A] Well, anyway,
we'll see you next time.

501
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:46,166
[BOY D]
Bye! Have a good night.

502
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:51,291
Man...

503
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:54,583
That's what makes deciding
on my future so hard.

504
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:04,541
Fascinating. There is
still so much to learn.
