It's been so long.

00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,208
Since the reunion, right?

3
00:01:44,291 --> 00:01:45,916
Uh, yeah.

00:01:47,125 --> 00:01:50,458
Things still all lovey-dovey
with that hairy man of yours?

Please. You know how it goes.

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,833
Our daughter is
the apple of his eye.

She's all he can see these days.

00:01:59,125 --> 00:02:01,041
Her name is Himeno, isn't it?

00:02:01,125 --> 00:02:03,250
Yes, though I'm
surprised you remember.

Guess you're not as
forgetful as you used to be.

So, tell me about her.

Does she take after her father?

Or did she get your looks?

00:02:10,958 --> 00:02:13,541
Should I be concerned about
your interest in my daughter?

Huh? Uh, no!

professional capacity.

[NOZOMI]
Hime?

Maybe, but she looks different.

No, there's something sexy

about this girl that
Hime doesn't have.

Ah!

Jeez, someone's jumpy.

[NOZOMI]
Well, someone snuck up on me.

27

Oh, you know.

Just thinking that you're
starting to grow up.

Little shota girl.

33
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:17,041
It's adorable.

34

[NOZOMI]
Don't call me a shota girl!

[AKECHI] Your newfound interest
in fashion, of course.

[NOZOMI]
Well?

Doesn't she look like Hime?

00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:39,875
[AKECHI] Hmm...
That's actually her, isn't it?

45
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,833
Yeah, that's what
I was thinking.

46
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:45,750
[AKECHI]
On the cover of a magazine?

47
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:47,875
Way to go, Hime!

48
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:49,791
Is that a big deal or something?

49
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:52,166
[AKECHI] Uh, you're
totally kidding me, right?

50
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,583
That's the kind of thing
people dream about.

51
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:57,333
It's sort of a shame,
though, don't you think?

52
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:58,416
Why's that?

53
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,791
You realize she's going to be

54
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:01,875
on a totally different
level than us now?

[NOZOMI]
Huh?

[AKECHI]
I mean, she's a model!

57

That's gonna keep
her pretty busy.

58
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:10,208
I bet she'll have to go to
work right after school.

59
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:13,875
She probably won't have time
to hang out with you anymore.

00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:15,041
You'll be all alone.

Why don't you try
being a model, too?

64
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:20,791
That's crazy.

65
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:22,583
[AKECHI] I think there's
a demand for your type.

66

There's no way I could do it.

I don't know anything
about fashion.

[AKECHI]
That's easy to fix.

Come over to my place.

I can teach you everything
you need to know.

Everything.

00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:33,875
I think I'm gonna pass.

Why? Come on!

00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:37,541
I need a shower after
that look you gave me.

[AKECHI groans]

00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:42,083
Okay, if that's how
you want to play it.

[NOZOMI]
Hmm?

78
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:50,000
[AKECHI]
Did you know that our school

79
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:52,125
doesn't allow students to work?

80
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:53,208
I heard there was a second year

81

who got caught,
and they were expelled.

Oh, dear. What if
someone finds out?

83
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,083
I might slip up

84

and accidentally tell a teacher
about Himeno's modeling

You're really evil.

change in P.E. before.

comb back your hair,

and then I've got
a wig for you to try on.

Perfect!

You're a precious little angel!

She is.

97
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:39,458
You're doing this
because you like to cosplay

98
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:42,083
not because you want to
teach me anything about fashion!

99

Yeah, so what?

100

Now, let's see how
this looks on you.

101

[NOZOMI]
Ugh...

102
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,791
Have you guys looked
through this magazine?

103
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:55,750
I mean, the pictures of
Himeno are pretty, and all,

104
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:57,291
but I don't get why
they have this spread

105
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:00,125
of an Antarctican snake girl.

106
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:02,166
I didn't really think
this was the kind of thing

107
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,875
snake people would read.

108
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:05,875
At least some
must if it's in there.

109
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:08,000
And "snake people"
is a derogatory term.

110
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:10,125
You should call them
Antarcticans.

111
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:12,208
Anyway, I'm not surprised
that spread is in there.

112

Magazines like
that are always careful

to treat all the races equally.

I think I've had enough.

115

If you're just going to use me
as a dress-up doll, I'm leaving.

Is that what matters?

begged me to do it.

Yeah, there aren't all
that many centaurs around.

in-chief kind of scares me.

163
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:31,375
Aw, but you could
totally pull it off, though.

164
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:33,958
If the school rules
were different, anyway.

165
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:36,000
[HIMENO] I don't think it
would be a good fit for me.

166
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:38,291
Huh...

167
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:39,666
[KYOKO]
I dunno.

168
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,000
You seem like
model material to me.

169
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:44,958
You're super cute,
and you've got the height.

170
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:48,291
I bet you could be successful
if you worked at it.

171
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:51,250
Even if that were true, a
model's not what I want to be.

172
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:52,750
Well, what is?

173
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:56,458
[HIMENO]
Hmm... A doctor, I think.

174
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:57,791
You a doctor?

175
00:08:57,875 --> 00:09:00,125
Sounds just a little scary.

176
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:02,416
That isn't very nice!

177
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,291
Remember there are dangers
to being a doctor, too.

178
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:06,416
[HIMENO, NOZOMI]
Huh?

179
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,750
Doctors get sued

180
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:10,333
for malpractice and stuff
all the time, you know.

181
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,750
I guess I hadn't really
thought of that before.

182
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:16,875
Okay, maybe I'd be better off
becoming a veterinarian instead.

183
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:19,875
[barks]

184
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:21,208
[HIMENO]
That's dangerous too, though.

185
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:23,541
I mean, what if one
of my patients bites me?

186
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:26,791
Besides, the only pets
I've had are fish.

187
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:28,875
[NOZOMI]
You could be a fishmonger, then.

188
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:30,791
Sell tropical fish and stuff.

189
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:33,416
[KYOKO] Fishmongers
sell fish for eating.

190
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,958
[HIMENO]
Tropical fish are tricky.

191
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,958
You have to watch the
nitrate levels of the water,

192
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:39,250
pH, temperature, everything.

193
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:43,083
[NOZOMI] Goldfish from festival
stalls never have their bowls

194
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:45,833
cleaned or anything,
and they live forever.

195
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,750
[HIMENO]
That's fine for them.

196
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:50,291
Algae produces oxygen
through photosynthesis,

197
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:53,375
breaks down their poop, and
even serves as food for them.

198
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:54,708
The problems happen

199
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:57,541
when humans clean their
bowls for easier viewing.

200
00:09:57,625 --> 00:10:00,041
So, what, are you some
kind of fish expert now?

201
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:01,541
Stop!

202
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:03,083
[HIMENO]
If I did become a doctor,

203
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:05,333
I wouldn't necessarily
have to see patients.

204
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:07,875
There are plenty of doctors
who just do research.

205
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:09,750
My dad says that medical
research is a good field

206
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:12,125
to go into because the
budgets tend to be higher than

207
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:14,125
in other areas of study.

208
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:16,958
[KYOKO]
Wow, fascinating.

209
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:19,041
[NOZOMI] You've really
thought this through, huh?

210
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:20,458
I'm impressed, Hime.

211
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:23,083
Maybe we should start thinking
about our futures, too.

212
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:24,708
Well, I should, at least.

213
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,583
You'll probably be
taking over the dojo.

214
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:27,666
Nope, don't think so.

215
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:28,958
Never gonna happen!

216
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:35,166
Why do I feel like there's
something I'm forgetting?

217
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:45,750
[KYOKO]
I mean, can you believe that?

218
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:46,958
[HIMENO chuckles]

219
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:50,833
Oh, what do you need?

220
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:53,125
I know something I think you
would find very interesting.

221
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:53,958
Want to hear it?

222
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:56,083
[NOZOMI]
Hmm?

223
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:58,125
[INUKAI] Akechi is working
part time at a maid café.

224
00:10:58,208 --> 00:10:59,291
[gasps]

225
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:01,291
Ah! No way!

226
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:03,541
[HIMENO]
Is something the matter?

227
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:05,500
[NOZOMI]
Uh... Nothing.

228
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:07,000
Thanks for that, Inukai.

229
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,541
You're pretty okay.

230
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:10,708
Don't mention it.

231
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:16,750
A little bird told me

232
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:18,875
that you're working
part-time at a maid café!

233
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:21,416
Yeah, sorta. You found out, huh?

234
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,208
[NOZOMI]
That's all you have to say?

235
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:27,458
Well, you had better
hope no one tells on you.

236
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:29,416
I trust that you're
not going to tell anyone.

237
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,166
After all, you're my friend.

238
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:36,125
So, are you saying
Hime's not your friend?

239
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:42,125
No, silly.

240
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:43,583
Of course, she is!

241
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:45,083
[NOZOMI growls]

242
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:49,708
[HIMENO]
Wait, what?

243
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:03,416
[KYOKO]
Brr.

244
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,250
It's freezing!

245
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:06,375
[sighs]

246
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:09,083
I'm a human popsicle.

247
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:12,000
[NOZOMI] You really are
a baby about the cold.

248
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:13,416
Well, I'm fragile.

249
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:17,666
[KYOKO] Not all of us discipline
ourselves with cold water baths.

250
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:19,375
Hey, shut up.

251
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:20,791
I don't do that.

252
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:22,291
[KYOKO sighs]

253
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:25,583
Talking about cold stuff is
just making me even colder.

254
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:28,041
[MANAMI]
Stop that. Get off of me.

255
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:30,208
[AKECHI laughs]
No way!

256
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,000
It's warm in here!

257
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:32,958
Honestly!

258
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:34,666
Hey, wait.

259
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:35,791
There!

260
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:37,458
Feel better now?

261
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,958
She's your girlfriend,
isn't she?

262
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:41,083
Do something!

263
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:43,125
I really would,
but she's a lost cause.

264
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:44,708
I'm sorry.

265
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:47,416
Oh! Hey, you three.

266
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,791
Yo, how's it going?

267
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:49,708
[NOZOMI]
Hey.

268
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,833
[HIMENO]
Nice to see you guys!

269
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:52,083
[KYOKO]
Good morning, I guess.

270
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:54,791
Ha! Come and
get in on this action.

271
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:56,208
It's so cozy!

272
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:58,125
They aren't yours to offer!

273
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:00,041
Aw...

274
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:03,125
Isn't this what
they're for, though?

275
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:05,583
[MANAMI]
No, they're for me.

276
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:07,583
Besides, the idea that
angelfolks' wings developed

277
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:10,958
as protection against the cold
is only one of many theories.

278
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:12,666
Nothing's been proven.

279
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,250
I know.

280
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:17,875
Some people even think they're
just decorative, like my horns.

281
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:20,666
They're warm,
though, so why not?

282
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:21,833
[KYOKO]
Lucky...

283
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:23,291
[NOZOMI]
Get a room.

284
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:30,333
[KYOKO sighs]
Nice and warm.

285
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:31,500
Hey, stop.

286
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:32,833
You're bothering Hime.

287
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:33,750
No, it's okay.

288
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:35,375
I don't mind.

289
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:37,083
Aren't you worried, though?

290
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:39,125
The other day you were
talking about being sent

291
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:41,208
to a correctional clinic.

292
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:42,375
[KYOKO] Yeah, that's
when we were talking

293
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:44,458
about getting up
on her completely.

294
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:48,166
I don't think I'll be arrested
for leaning on her shoulder.

295
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,291
'Kay. I'll join ya.

296
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:51,833
[gasps]

297
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:56,333
Oh, I take it back, this is
starting to get embarrassing.

298
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:58,750
Oooh. Nice.

299
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:00,458
Thanks for the show.

300
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,666
Lucky.

301
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,458
Well, I'm not
letting you in mine.

302
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:12,333
Who would want to
snuggle up to you, anyway?

303
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:15,041
You handle the heat just as
badly as you handle the cold.

304
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:17,583
Is there any
temperature you do like?

305
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:19,791
[KYOKO]
I have a delicate constitution.

306
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:22,125
This weather doesn't
bother you, Hime?

307
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:23,625
[HIMENO]
Hmm...

308
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:26,000
I don't mind the cold nearly
as much as you, I guess,

309
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:27,916
but I can't
stand the heat.

310
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,625
No wonder, given
how large your body is.

311
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:35,000
[KYOKO] Animals in polar
regions tend to be big.

312
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,833
[HIMENO]
Mm-hmm.

313
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:39,875
[KYOKO] It's an
evolutionary thing, I think.

314
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:42,208
The reduced ratio of
body mass to surface area

315
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:45,250
helps them maintain
a constant temperature.

316
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:46,625
Yeah, that makes sense.

317
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:48,625
[NOZOMI]
I think you lost me somewhere.

318
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:50,750
You're comparing
Hime to a polar bear?

319
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:52,083
[HIMENO]
A polar bear?

320
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:56,208
Those are kind of cute,
but also kind of not.

321
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:58,375
I have an idea, Kyoko.

322
00:14:58,458 --> 00:14:59,833
[KYOKO]
Hmm?

323
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:01,583
Maybe it would help you to
forget how cold you are now

324
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:02,666
if you thought about sometime

325
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,000
when you felt warm
and happy instead.

326
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:06,875
Wait. What about
that time last spring?

327
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:08,583
That might work.

328
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:10,083
[KYOKO]
Hmm...

329
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,500
Am I melting?

330
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:20,291
I think I'm melting.

331
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:23,416
[SOLDIER B]
Hi there.

332
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,666
Stick together.
It's easy to get lost here.

333
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:32,000
It almost feels like

334
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:33,791
we're walking into
a jungle, doesn't it?

335
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:37,083
Except the jungle doesn't
smell so much like salt water.

336
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:03,500
Well, hello and welcome

337
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,833
to the fourteenth
High School for Waterfolk.

338
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:06,958
Aw, score!

339
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:08,333
We've hit the jackpot here!

340
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:09,958
Quit staring, you perv.

341
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:11,250
[KOMORI]
I can't!

342
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:14,083
They're all so hot,
and their racks are huge.

343
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:15,500
What are you talking about?

344
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:16,916
Boobs!

345
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,708
Mountainfolk have the
strangest bodies, don't they?

346
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:20,500
They're so different from ours.

347
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:22,375
That one in front
has such a flat chest

348
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:24,875
it's hard to
believe she's a girl.

349
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:26,916
Follow me, please.

350
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:33,541
[NOZOMI]
The way the merfolk are moving,

351
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:36,916
they kinda look more like
upright snakes than fish.

352
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,625
Maybe it's like treading water.

353
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:39,875
I mean, if they swam normally,

354
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:42,125
their textbooks would
get wet, wouldn't they?

355
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:43,583
They lowered
the water level today

356
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,791
to make it easier for you
mountainfolk to get around,

357
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:47,166
but if you want, I can show you

358
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:50,000
how we really swim later,
during our free period.

359
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:52,416
Hello!

360
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,541
Hi.

361
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:54,458
Nice to meet you.

362
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:56,250
Yeah, same to you.

363
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:57,333
Hi--

364
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:59,250
[BOY A] So, you enjoying
yourself so far?

365
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:00,833
Uh...

366
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:02,166
[BOY B] Hey, how about we get
out of here during free period?

367
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,083
Back off, bro,
I got to her first.

368
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:06,500
What do you say I show
you around town later?

369
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:08,250
Nah, you should go with me.

370
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:09,708
I'm a good time.

371
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:11,125
Don't listen to them.

372
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:13,666
Kyoko seems to be a real
hit with the boys here.

373
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:16,250
She's a lot different than
the girls they're used to.

374
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:17,875
I can't help but notice
that you all seem

375
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:19,958
to have beautiful figures
and large eyes.

376
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:22,416
Uh, thank you.

377
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,083
[MANAMI] A lot different than
you see in paintings.

378
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,666
Huh?

379
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:30,333
Your tail is touching me.

380
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,458
'Cause you're taking
up the whole desk.

381
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:33,708
So, cute!

382
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:34,708
Look at him!

383
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:36,458
She's huge!

384
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:39,791
[MANAMI]
This should be interesting.

385
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:42,541
Hey you've got a pretty
unique look yourself.

386
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:44,875
I look "unique"? Like, how?

387
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:48,916
I promised myself
I wasn't going to ask,

388
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,166
but are you actually a boy?

389
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,541
A boy?

390
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:53,500
[GIRL E] Well, you look
just like the main character

391
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:54,750
in this book!

392
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,166
[NOZOMI]
No. I'm a girl.

393
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,666
[GIRL E]
Really? Let's see.

394
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,833
Hey! What are you doing?

395
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:05,416
Aw. I'm sorry about that.

396
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,458
What's going on over there?

397
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:16,083
All right, everyone,
it's time to begin class.

398
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,541
Settle down.

399
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:29,500
Quiet.

400
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:36,916
[MANAMI]
I feel like I've lost.

401
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,250
Very good.

402
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:40,000
Now then, all of you from
Shin Kanata High School

403
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:41,583
are probably...

404
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:44,000
And that was supposed
to be a good memory?

405
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:45,833
[NOZOMI]
Those guys were all over you...

406
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,291
...which doesn't happen often.

407
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:48,875
[KYOKO]
What was that last part?

408
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:53,083
And anyway, I almost ended
up with heatstroke that day.

409
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:56,291
It's probably a lot warmer
there than it is here now.

410
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:59,375
[KYOKO] Actually,
I heard it's cold in winter.

411
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:01,791
[NOZOMI] But they're
basically naked year-round.

412
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:03,375
How does that work?

413
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:04,583
[KYOKO] Their bodies
are built differently

414
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:06,958
than people of the other races.

415
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:08,291
They have to be,

416
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:11,083
considering they live
in water all their lives.

417
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:14,708
[KYOKO] Man, we're talking
about cold stuff again.

418
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:16,750
[laughs]

419
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:18,416
Sorry. Whoops.

420
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,208
No, don't worry about it.

421
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:23,041
You're going to
knock somebody over

422
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:24,791
if you're not more careful.

423
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:26,541
I know.

424
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:33,083
[NOZOMI] There's still
something overwhelming

425
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:35,250
about the merfolk to me.

426
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:36,500
Maybe.

427
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:38,041
But did you see how
he was carrying her,

428
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:40,500
like she was a princess?

429
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:45,750
[KYOKO] Your boyfriend
would need a crane.

430
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:46,750
[HIMENO]
Don't be mean!

431
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:48,333
I'm not that heavy.

432
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:53,250
I'd give anything to
have legs instead of fins.

433
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:54,166
[KOMA]
Don't say that.

434
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,875
Huh?

435
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:56,916
Don't you see?

436
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,625
You're not worth
any less as a person

437
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:00,833
just because you
can't walk on land.

438
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:03,458
It's all about
evolution, y'know?

439
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:07,625
What's wrong?

440
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:11,250
Is it a STEM major thing,
or a boy thing?

441
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:12,166
[KOMA]
Huh?

442
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:12,958
[PURPLE HAIR GIRL]
Hey, look.

443
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:15,333
It's Koma and Shizuura.

444
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:18,666
[snickers] You've got a pretty
raw deal, don't you Koma?

445
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:21,000
[KOMA]
No. I really don't, actually.

446
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:22,458
That's right.

447
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:25,125
He does this
because he wants to.

448
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:28,791
Oh, yeah? Somebody
sounds a little defensive.

449
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:31,125
Well, we don't
want to interrupt.

450
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:33,541
We'll just leave you two alone.

451
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:38,833
Why does he always go to so
much trouble for her, anyway?

452
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:41,375
Just because they've been
friends since they were little,

453
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:45,125
and she's kinda pretty
and has big boobs?

454
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:49,541
Probably. Sounds like
more than enough reasons.

455
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:54,291
An old friend,
pretty, big boobs.

456
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:10,750
[DOCTOR] Introducing
the Cyber Troll Company's

457
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:13,833
latest walking
assistance machine!

458
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:16,375
Climbs up and
down stairs with ease!

459
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:17,875
And, should you
lose your balance,

460
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:19,958
it'll always be
there to catch you.

461
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:21,708
Its sophisticated,
cutting-edge design

462
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:24,666
even makes surfing possible!

463
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,208
Doctor, some people believe that

464
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:28,416
allotting most of the equal
supplementary budget

465
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,416
to merfolk is
reverse discrimination.

466
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,958
Am I correct in assuming
you disagree with that?

467
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,000
I believe we must do
whatever is necessary

468
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:37,083
to achieve perfect equality.

469
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:38,833
We have made great
progress in that area,

470
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:40,083
but there is always more...

471
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:42,000
Here, I've got our drinks.

472
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:43,500
What's that you're watching?

473
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:46,333
A walking assistance
machine for merfolk.

474
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:47,416
I want one.

475
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,541
[KOMA]
That's expensive!

476
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:52,791
I could probably get
financial aid for it.

477
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:55,250
[KOMA]
Yeah. I guess.

478
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:57,125
Well...

479
00:21:58,208 --> 00:21:59,666
[sighs]
You're right.

480
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,750
It's way too expensive.
