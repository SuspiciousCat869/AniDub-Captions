1
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,333
[gasp]

2
00:01:54,041 --> 00:01:55,125
[CHIS gasp]

3
00:01:55,208 --> 00:01:56,500
[CHIS]
It's a dinosaur!

4
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:57,958
No, she's not.

5
00:01:58,041 --> 00:02:00,041
'Kay, so she's a snake, then?

6
00:02:00,125 --> 00:02:03,416
[MANAMI] This is Quetzalcoatl.
She's an Antarctican.

7
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,875
[CHIHO]
Antarcti-- What?

8
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:08,041
Que-- Quet-- Quetz-- Quetz--

9
00:02:08,125 --> 00:02:09,250
Quetzy?

10
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:10,583
[SUU]
Please.

11
00:02:10,666 --> 00:02:12,833
I would rather you use my
given name, Sassassul.

12
00:02:12,916 --> 00:02:14,958
Uh, how about "Suu"?

13
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:17,416
It's a pleasure to meet you.

14
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,041
So what does your
mouth look like?

15
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:20,833
Do you have lots of teeth?

16
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:22,708
[CHIS scream]

17
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:31,166
That was cool! Do it again!

18
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,416
[CHIS scream]

19
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:37,833
Girls! Stop that.
Don't be rude!

20
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:39,583
I'm sorry about my sisters.

21
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:41,416
No. Please, it's fine.

22
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,916
I like that they aren't
hesitant to approach me.

23
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,166
It makes me feel
more comfortable.

24
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,125
[KYOKO]
Hello, little Sue.

25
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:53,500
Well, go on, what do we
say when somebody greets us?

26
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:57,500
Oh, sorry. Hi.

27
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,833
A little more soft-spoken
than her big sis, huh?

28
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:04,333
The Chisters take
after her, though.

29
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:06,083
No doubtin' that.

30
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:08,625
[SUU]
Can you please get down?

31
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:11,833
I'm afraid you'll
strain my neck.

32
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:15,041
[MANAMI] Do they take after
me? I was nothing like them.

33
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:18,750
I was so quiet, my nickname
was "the Doll."

34
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:21,458
[CHIS]
Hey, Sis, we're all sweaty now.

35
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:24,291
[MANAMI] Well, it's a good thing
we're headed to the pool, then.

36
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:26,666
[ALL]
Yeah! The pool!

37
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,166
[CHINAMI]
Well, what are we waiting for?

38
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,375
Let's get going!

39
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:31,250
No running, you three.

40
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:33,000
[ALL laughing]

41
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:38,458
I'm so ready to get
some sun today!

42
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:01,041
There we go.

43
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,041
Good.

44
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:29,083
Look! I changed all by myself.

45
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:30,583
Yeah, you did great.

46
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:31,958
[SHINO]
Thanks!

47
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:35,791
[CHIS] We changed all
by ourselves, too!

48
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:38,708
Well, it's not as impressive
when you three do it.

49
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:41,375
[ALL]
Poo!

50
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:43,875
Come on, let's get
out there, huh?

51
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:48,791
Wow, there's nothin' there.

52
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:51,291
[SUU] My kind don't need
to nurse our young.

53
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:55,291
Besides, I could say
the same for you two.

54
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:57,458
To be fair, we're not
nursing now, either.

55
00:04:57,541 --> 00:04:59,000
Yeah, that's right.

56
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:12,541
It gets deeper
toward the middle.

57
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:13,875
Here!

58
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:23,833
[SHINO] Hime, I can't swim
here. It's too shallow.

59
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:25,333
Yeah, it's hard to
swim with your hooves

60
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:27,083
touching the bottom of the pool.

61
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:28,500
Huh?

62
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:29,791
You coming in?

63
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:34,166
Well, um, I'm actually
terrified of water.

64
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,791
[KYOKO]
Oh.

65
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:37,875
Even when it's this shallow?

66
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:40,583
The depth isn't the
issue, unfortunately.

67
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:44,583
It's the water itself.
Being in it frightens me.

68
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:46,375
It likely comes from
living in a place

69
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:50,541
where falling into the water
means certain death.

70
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:53,541
[KYOKO] Don't you have hot
springs and stuff, though?

71
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:55,541
Bathing is not a
custom of our kind.

72
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:58,166
Without sweat glands,
it doesn't really work.

73
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,125
We do clean our
bodies, of course.

74
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:02,458
[KYOKO] I'm impressed you
made it across the ocean.

75
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:03,791
I don't have wings,

76
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:06,291
but there are other ways
of flying through the air.

77
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:09,041
[CHIHO] Come on,
snake lady! Time to get in!

78
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:11,625
Please, I'll just stay out here.

79
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:13,125
[SUU screams]

80
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:16,833
[KYOKO]
Dead yet?

81
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:19,208
I appear to have survived.

82
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:20,875
Mew.

83
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,541
Are you okay?

84
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:29,000
Mew?

85
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:32,208
So cute!

86
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,208
[CHIS]
Isn't she?

87
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:39,916
It's time for a
change of scenery.

88
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,083
We're gonna check out the
racing pool. You comin'?

89
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:44,333
I'll just stay here.

90
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:47,791
Can I go, too?
I wanna go swim.

91
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:50,000
Okay, why don't we
go together, then?

92
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:51,208
[SHINO chuckles]

93
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:52,708
[ALL laughing]

94
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:53,750
[ALL]
Huh?

95
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:57,916
[ALL]
Wait up! We're coming, too!

96
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,750
[MANAMI]
Uh.

97
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:01,583
Where do you think you're going?

98
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:04,166
What're you doing?
Don't be pervy!

99
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,958
[MANAMI]
I'm not being pervy.

100
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:07,916
You three can't go
to the racing pool.

101
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,833
[CHIHO]
How come Shino gets to go?

102
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:11,375
Because she's a centaur.

103
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:14,416
Besides, were you going
to leave Sue behind?

104
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,291
[ALL]
Poo!

105
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:18,041
[MANAMI]
Careful, keep making that face,

106
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:19,458
it'll get stuck that way.

107
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:21,916
[ALL]
That wouldn't be pretty!

108
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,250
If you want to
learn how to swim,

109
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:24,583
I'll teach you here.

110
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:26,916
[SUU] I'm staying in
the shallow pool, too.

111
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,958
[CHIS grumble]

112
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:35,625
[SHINO] They're really good
swimmers, aren't they?

113
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:37,166
[HIMENO]
Yeah.

114
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,458
Surprising for Kyoko.

115
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:45,291
Did you see that
mermaid? Cool, huh?

116
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:50,916
[HIMENO]
Oh, it's deep.

117
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,500
It has to be for the
diving boards, I guess.

118
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:55,125
Can we go to the other side?

119
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:56,458
We should stay here.

120
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:58,416
My hooves don't touch the
bottom past this spot.

121
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,458
You mean you don't
know how to swim?

122
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:02,333
Well, no, that's
not the problem.

123
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:03,875
It's just if I did go under,

124
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:06,333
nobody would be
able to pull me out.

125
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:11,458
Hey, you ever wonder how
mermaids get out of the pool

126
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:13,416
and onto the diving blocks?

127
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,083
They probably get a
friend to help them.

128
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:35,583
Wow, that jump was amazing.

129
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:38,666
I think everyone was too busy
ooking at her chest to notice.

130
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,291
Your hooves will touch
the bottom soon,

131
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:41,791
so stretch your
front legs forward

132
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:43,958
and just kick with
your back legs.

133
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:46,458
Otherwise, you risk
cracking a hoof.

134
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:49,333
Good, we made it across.

135
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:50,666
I'm getting tired,

136
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:53,416
so let's head back to
where the little Chis are.

137
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,541
[SHINO]
'Kay.

138
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,500
Practicing your kicks, huh?

139
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,291
[CHIS]
Meow.

140
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:06,166
Wanna go play a little more?

141
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,708
[CHIS]
Hmph!

142
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:10,500
Aren't you too busy learning
how to swim in the big kid pool?

143
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:12,041
Hey!

144
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,708
[SHINO]
Heads up!

145
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:17,333
What was that for?

146
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:19,000
Oops, I slipped.

147
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:21,708
Ha! You are going down now!

148
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:22,583
[NOZOMI laughs]

149
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:23,333
[NOZOMI]
Take that!

150
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:24,708
[CHIS]
Meow!

151
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:32,958
[BOTH laughing]

152
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:44,250
That's hot, so make sure
you blow on it first.

153
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:47,375
Yummy?

154
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:48,041
[SHINO]
Mh-hm!

155
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:49,375
Warms you right up.

156
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:52,375
Pools can leave you
feeling a bit chilly.

157
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:55,916
[MANAMI]
Uh-oh.

158
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,666
I think we've lost one.

159
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:01,583
I'm not surprised after
how hard they played. Huh?

160
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:05,333
Are you sleepy too, Shino?
Go ahead and rest.

161
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:10,083
Hey, no napping for you three.

162
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:11,333
[CHIS]
Why not?

163
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:13,625
Because there's only
one of me, that's why.

164
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:16,708
I don't have enough arms
to carry all of you.

165
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:19,458
Shino has one big sis
all to herself, though!

166
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:21,875
So how come there's
only one of you for us?

167
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:24,041
Yeah, shouldn't we
have three big sisters?

168
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,416
Don't be silly.

169
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,708
Think of it this way:
If you had three sisters,

170
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:29,333
you'd get three
times the nagging.

171
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:31,375
[CHIS]
That wouldn't be awesome.

172
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,125
[NOZOMI]
Well, today's special,

173
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:35,916
so go ahead and
sleep if you want.

174
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,958
Wait, you can't just
make that decision.

175
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:40,125
What's wrong?

176
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:42,083
They have three extra
big sisters today.

177
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:44,541
[CHIGUSA, CHINAMI]
All right! Carry me, too!

178
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:46,208
Yeah, sure, I don't mind.

179
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:47,541
I don't mind, either.

180
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:50,833
I used to help care for
my younger sister, too.

181
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:53,083
[HIMENO] I didn't know
you had a younger sister.

182
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:54,125
Yes.

183
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:55,541
We're all born of
the same queen,

184
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:58,041
so that means we are
all related by blood.

185
00:10:58,125 --> 00:10:59,750
It's different than
in human society,

186
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:02,541
where families tend to have two
parents and a few children.

187
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:04,500
[NOZOMI]
Wow, that's really wild.

188
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:07,083
[SUU] Although, when I
speak of my younger sister,

189
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,333
I am actually referring
to a specific child

190
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:11,375
who I was responsible
for raising.

191
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:13,666
It's not exactly the same,
but has much in common

192
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,208
with your concept
of a younger sister.

193
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,625
Are you sure? It's kind
of a hike to our house.

194
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:29,333
Yeah. I don't think a little
walk is gonna kill any of us.

195
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:30,541
[MANAMI]
Uh.

196
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:31,791
I'd like to hear more
about how you raised

197
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:33,916
your younger sister sometime.

198
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:36,375
The kids aren't the only ones.

199
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:38,125
I'm getting sleepy now, too.

200
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:40,708
Too bad. We can't
carry you, you know.

201
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:42,291
Aw.

202
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:45,875
[KYOKO] Hey, eyes open.
You don't want to drop Shino.

203
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:47,958
Yeah.

204
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,041
[HIMENO yawns]

205
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:02,583
[HIMENO, NOZOMI]
Hm?

206
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:04,333
[chuckles]

207
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:07,166
We're gonna tell scary stories.

208
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,250
[gasps]

209
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:09,791
What do you mean, like,

210
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:12,333
the kinda stories with
ghosts and stuff in them?

211
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:14,375
[VICE PRESIDENT]
That's right.

212
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:15,875
Monsters, too!

213
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:17,875
[HIMENO yelps]

214
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:19,000
[NOZOMI]
That's enough outta you.

215
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:20,458
--[slap]
--[VICE PRESIDENT grunts]

216
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:22,916
Telling scary stories
in broad daylight?

217
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,500
[VICE PRESIDENT]
No way. It has to be after dark.

218
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:27,875
In fact, I was
thinking this Friday.

219
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:30,250
If that works for you guys,
I'll get permission.

220
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:31,833
[NOZOMI]
To stay overnight?

221
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:34,583
[VICE PRESIDENT] I figure we'll
wrap things up by about ten.

222
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:36,083
[KYOKO gasps]

223
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:37,791
[NOZOMI] Are you even
allowed to set this up

224
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:40,333
without asking your
shrimp of a president?

225
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:42,791
Well, you see, Nozomi,
that's the point.

226
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:46,125
You all are awfully impertinent
for underclassmen, aren't you?

227
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:48,000
Are we impertinent?

228
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:50,125
I think we're
perfectly respectful.

229
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:52,125
Anyway, I'm going to
need a firm commitment

230
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:53,666
from all of you first.

231
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:56,958
I can't have you backing
out after I invite Towako.

232
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,166
[NOZOMI] If you're so
desperate to do this,

233
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:03,291
why not just recruit Captain
Mystery Spot over there?

234
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:06,166
[VICE PRESIDENT]
It isn't his company I'm after.

235
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,708
Oh, I see now.
So that's how it is?

236
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:11,333
That's exactly how it is.

237
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:13,333
[NOZOMI]
Well, that clears things up.

238
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:14,583
[VICE PRESIDENT]
There's no chance she'll come

239
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:17,416
if it's just going to be
the two of us, you know?

240
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,208
She puts on a good face,
but I know she gets lonely.

241
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:22,666
If you'll all be there,
I'm sure she'll agree to it.

242
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:23,750
And it'll give us a chance

243
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:25,291
to get to know our
clubmates better.

244
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,666
Two birds with one stone.

245
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:28,958
I feel so used.

246
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:30,583
Inviting us for cover?

247
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:32,166
Not totally.

248
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,291
We can compile all our
stories into a booklet

249
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:36,083
and submit it as a
record of our activities

250
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:38,166
at the end of the year.

251
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,708
Think about it.

252
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:41,333
We'll get a club room and
a bigger budget for next year.

253
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:43,041
So three birds with one stone.

254
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:46,000
When did we say anything about
wanting to stay in the club?

255
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:49,583
I don't know. Might be nice to
have a room to hang out in.

256
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:50,875
[NOZOMI grumbles]

257
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:52,875
Still sounds like
a hassle to me.

258
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:55,291
I have to leave here,
go teach brats karate, shower,

259
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:56,833
then turn around and
come back to school?

260
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:59,708
[HIMENO] Come on,
we should support them.

261
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:00,875
[NOZOMI, KYOKO]
We should?

262
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:03,666
I mean, why not, right?
What can it hurt?

263
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:04,875
[VICE PRESIDENT]
Kimihara.

264
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:05,666
Huh?

265
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:06,750
Thank you!

266
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:08,083
[NOZOMI yelps]

267
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:13,416
You should keep your
hands to yourself

268
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,166
if you don't want another one.

269
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,666
I just expressed my happiness

270
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,375
a little too
eagerly, that's all.

271
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:20,833
[NOZOMI]
Not buyin' that.

272
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:22,125
[VICE PRESIDENT]
It's true, though.

273
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:23,625
I'll give you a hug,
too, to prove it.

274
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:25,833
So now you're sexually
harassing me?

275
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:27,375
Hey, one question.

276
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:30,666
Why not just ask her out
like a normal person?

277
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,083
[VICE PRESIDENT]
If I thought that would work,

278
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:34,958
I wouldn't be asking
you people for help.

279
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,375
And also, why scary stories?

280
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:38,916
That all you could think of?

281
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,833
It's this or a
mystery spot tour,

282
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:44,208
a power spot pilgrimage,
or UFO gazing.

283
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:46,250
A horror movie marathon
would be better.

284
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:47,416
So you're hoping this will

285
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,208
bring you and the club
president closer?

286
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:50,416
[VICE PRESIDENT]
Mh-hm.

287
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,708
Will you please help me?

288
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:53,083
Sure!

289
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:57,458
Are you sure?
You won't get scared?

290
00:14:57,541 --> 00:14:59,083
I'll try real hard!

291
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:01,416
[VICE PRESIDENT]
So... I can count all of you in?

292
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,958
[KYOKO]
Fine with me, I guess.

293
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:04,916
[NOZOMI]
Well, if Hime's going to go.

294
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,333
[HIMENO]
I will if you all do.

295
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:08,250
[SUU] It sounds like an
excellent opportunity

296
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:09,958
to experience your culture.

297
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:11,500
[VICE PRESIDENT]
Awesome!

298
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:14,375
So everyone needs to come up
with about ten scary stories.

299
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:15,625
Overkill, much?

300
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:18,125
I'm excited to hear what
everybody comes up with!

301
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,666
And you really won't be scared?

302
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:22,208
I should be fine as long
as no ghosts show up.

303
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:23,583
[VICE PRESIDENT]
It's settled, then.

304
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:26,541
Be honest, though. You think
this is going to work?

305
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,208
The prez doesn't
strike me as the type

306
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:30,291
to be bothered by scary stories.

307
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:32,666
This might not go
the way you expect.

308
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,125
[TOWAKO]
I only believe what can be

309
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:36,750
objectively verified as truth!

310
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:38,541
[VICE PRESIDENT]
You don't know Towako that well.

311
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:40,708
I, on the other hand,
know everything,

312
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:42,208
including her measurements.

313
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:43,500
I like my chances.

314
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:44,958
[NOZOMI]
You're gross.

315
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:49,916
[DOG barking]

316
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:55,083
[HIMENO] The school is pretty
scary at night, isn't it?

317
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:56,708
[TOWAKO]
Yeah, kind of.

318
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:57,833
What?

319
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:58,833
I thought you didn't
believe in ghosts,

320
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,125
so what's to be scared of?

321
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:04,125
Ghosts or not,
this place is still creepy.

322
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:05,750
[NOZOMI]
Hey, you know what I heard?

323
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:09,416
This was a graveyard before
the school was built here.

324
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,083
I'm kidding. It
was just a field.

325
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:15,291
[HIMENO]
Jeez, don't do that!

326
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:17,208
[NOZOMI] You do hear a
lot of stories in a city

327
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:19,166
full of research schools
like this, though.

328
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:22,833
The one about the dog with
the human face started here.

329
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:25,166
I heard it used to be a
secret refuge for victims

330
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,458
of human experimentation
gone wrong.

331
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:29,875
Ah! That's too scary
to think about!

332
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:32,250
Enough of the dumb
urban legends already.

333
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:35,750
Especially since we haven't even
officially gotten started yet.

334
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:39,416
[NOZOMI]
Tatami mats?

335
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,375
[KYOKO]
This building must've had

336
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:43,083
a different purpose originally.

337
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:44,833
[NOZOMI]
Why candles?

338
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:46,750
[VICE PRESIDENT]
I figured why not go all-out?

339
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:49,375
No way I'm sticking around
for a hundred scary stories.

340
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:51,250
[VICE PRESIDENT] It's just
about setting the mood.

341
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:52,541
Come on, it'll be fun!

342
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:54,708
[HIMENO]
I'm already getting scared.

343
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:55,750
[VICE PRESIDENT]
All right.

344
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:58,750
I think we're ready
to get started.

345
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:03,416
'Kay. I'll do the first story.

346
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,458
So we all know this
town's origins, right?

347
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:07,833
How it started back in the day

348
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:11,041
as a college and industrial
research center?

349
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:13,708
Well, the events in the
story I'm about to tell

350
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:16,875
took place just after
the town was founded.

351
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,541
And so, that test
subject lingers still,

352
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,458
lurking down in the sewers.

353
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:27,791
Waiting there for the
next unfortunate victim

354
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:30,000
to come along.

355
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:32,750
And maybe... it will be you!

356
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:35,333
No, please, save me, Nozomi!

357
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:38,166
Stop laughing!
Trade seats with me?

358
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,666
[KYOKO]
Nah. I think I'll pass.

359
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:42,208
What's so scary about
an urban legend like that?

360
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:45,500
Well, uh, maybe because it seems
like it could really be true.

361
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:47,000
It's fitting for
a town like this

362
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:48,916
that it was about
genetic manipulation

363
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,375
instead of something like
demons or ghostly samurai.

364
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:54,083
[KYOKO]
Sometimes science is scarier

365
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:56,000
than the most frightening myths.

366
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:57,875
We don't know when we
might take it too far

367
00:17:57,958 --> 00:17:59,875
or what the
consequences could be.

368
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:01,583
That's the point of the story.

369
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:03,208
[SUU] That we don't know
the limits of science

370
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:05,916
and testing them
could be dangerous?

371
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,916
[KYOKO]
Yeah, that's exactly it.

372
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,375
[HIMENO] Do you have scary
stories in Antarctica?

373
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:11,583
No, we don't.

374
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:13,458
You see, we don't
believe in souls,

375
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:15,625
or in supernatural phenomena.

376
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:19,875
In fact, we can't even
conceive of such things.

377
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:21,416
Of course, when I say that,

378
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,875
I don't mean to
deny your beliefs.

379
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:26,416
Nah. We don't really
believe in that stuff either.

380
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,583
Maybe not, but
it's still scary!

381
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:32,208
Now that I think about,
I do remember something.

382
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:33,708
When I was young,

383
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:36,375
I would walk only on the cracks
of the flagstone streets.

384
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:43,416
[SUU]
The one in charge of raising me

385
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,791
asked my reason for doing so.

386
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:48,708
[gasps]

387
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:54,666
You thought you'd fall?

388
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,208
[SUU]
Yes.

389
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:59,000
Rationally, I know that such
a thing isn't possible, but--

390
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:01,000
So basically, it's like this.

391
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:04,583
Antarcticans actually are
capable of being superstitious,

392
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:06,875
but they deny it because
it goes against the idea

393
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:10,208
that they are a civilization
founded on logic and reason.

394
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:11,416
Right?

395
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:13,958
[SUU]
That's amazing!

396
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:16,500
I knew I came to the
human world for a reason.

397
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:18,875
Well, thanks, but I don't
even know if I'm right.

398
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:21,125
Hey, we used to do
stuff like that, too.

399
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:23,166
Like when we would only
walk on the white lines

400
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:24,666
when we were using
the crosswalk.

401
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,208
Oh, yeah, we did do that.

402
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:28,166
And we made sure to stick
to the shaded parts

403
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,958
of the sidewalk, remember?

404
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:33,666
'Cause if you stepped in the
wrong place, you'd fall forever!

405
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:34,916
[VICE PRESIDENT]
Hey.

406
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,375
Didn't we come here to
tell scary stories?

407
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:38,708
[TOWAKO]
But science is more interesting

408
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:40,375
than stupid occult stuff.

409
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:41,375
Ha!

410
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:42,500
You just want to
change the subject

411
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:44,458
because you're
scared, aren't you?

412
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:46,500
[TOWAKO]
Uh! Hmph.

413
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:50,666
Well, okay, I can compromise
by telling a scary story

414
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:54,541
that also happens
to be scientific.

415
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:57,375
Plenty of people claim
to have seen spirits.

416
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:58,583
Soldiers, for example,

417
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:00,791
say they've seen Warring
States commanders

418
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:03,208
or fighters from the World War.

419
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:04,500
But there are never any mentions

420
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:07,791
of Kofun Period armor
or Bakumatsu rifles.

421
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:10,416
No primitive men
in furs, either.

422
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:13,583
And with animal spirits,

423
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:15,875
they're always things
like dogs or cats.

424
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:18,333
Creatures people everywhere
are familiar with.

425
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:20,416
No one sees Naumann's elephants.

426
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,750
In other words, no one
witnesses things

427
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:25,333
that don't exist in their
own consciousness.

428
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:28,541
That's why they're regarded
as hallucinations.

429
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:31,875
Except, I have a friend
who was walking by the sea

430
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:34,500
in a certain town one day,

431
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:36,583
and do you know what he saw?

432
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:45,833
[gasps]

433
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:52,458
[TEEN] Anomalocaris?
Aren't those extinct?

434
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:56,333
And it's walking.
How is that possible?

435
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:06,250
[TEEN] "A predatory creature
from the Cambrian Period.

436
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:08,958
It's believed they
swam in shallow seas,

437
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:13,041
but some fossils have been found
showing evidence of legs."

438
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:16,250
No way. Some of
them could walk!

439
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:20,125
[VICE PRESIDENT]
My friend saw something

440
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:22,833
that he never even
knew had existed.

441
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:25,041
So it must have been...

442
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:34,916
...a real ghost of
an Anomalocaris!

443
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,958
[HIMENO screams]

444
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:44,583
Your face is scarier
than that story.

445
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:47,000
Okay, I think I've had
enough of this for now.

446
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:49,250
I'm going to take a break
from these ridiculous stories

447
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:50,791
and use the restroom.

448
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:53,083
Does anyone want to,
um, come with?

449
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:54,833
[ALL]
Uh?

450
00:21:57,541 --> 00:22:00,208
Stop! Don't go
thinking I'm scared.

451
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:01,666
I'll come if you want.

452
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:02,833
Me, too.

453
00:22:02,916 --> 00:22:04,666
Seriously, I'm not
even a little scared!

454
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,166
I mean it!
