[SHINO giggles]

2
00:01:40,958 --> 00:01:43,291
Hime. I love-love you!

3
00:01:45,125 --> 00:01:48,000
Himeno certainly is
popular with girls, isn't she?

4
00:01:48,083 --> 00:01:49,541
Sure, but what's
wrong with that?

5
00:01:49,625 --> 00:01:50,791
It's probably a lot better

6
00:01:50,875 --> 00:01:53,041
than getting into
trouble with boys, right?

7
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:55,541
Of course,
since she's so pretty.

8
00:01:55,625 --> 00:01:56,541
[MIDORIKO]
I'd think boys

9
00:01:56,625 --> 00:01:57,833
wouldn't leave her
alone, either.

10
00:01:57,916 --> 00:02:00,458
As for Shino, I imagine
she loves being spoiled

11
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:04,916
by her big cousin instead
of nagged at by her mom.

12
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,791
Shino's a cute little girl.

13
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:09,625
She reminds me a lot of
Himeno when she was that age.

14
00:02:09,708 --> 00:02:11,666
Really? Lucky girl!

15
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:15,000
Hey, Shino, you're going to be
a beauty when you grow up.

16
00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:17,916
If she takes after her

17
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,833
in the brains department,
too, it'll be perfect.

18
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:21,000
[RINO sighs]

19
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:22,791
That wouldn't necessarily
be a blessing.

20
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:24,458
[MIDORIKO] Are you kidding?
Of course, it would.

21
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:26,500
Do you know how much of
a relief it would be to us

22
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:30,000
for Shino to get into a national
prep school like Hime did?

23
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:33,208
If nothing else, it would
do wonders for our budget.

24
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:35,083
It's not that simple, though.

25
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:37,208
Being smart comes
with its own problems.

26
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:39,041
You spend too
much money on books!

27
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:41,625
We still have loans
to pay off, you know.

28
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:44,250
[RINO] I wonder if it might be
better not to have the pressure

29
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:46,250
that comes with going
to a good school.

30
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,708
[MIDORIKO] I would at least like
her to have the option, though.

31
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:51,500
Why don't we go read
a story in my room?

32
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:56,541
The knight defeated
the evil magician

33
00:02:56,625 --> 00:02:59,458
and returned to his
homeland with the princess.

34
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:02,625
They established a democracy
where all people were equal.

35
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:06,666
Freedom and justice reigned,
and everyone was happy.

36
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,500
Yay!

37
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:10,458
Does it feel hot in here to you?

38
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:12,916
No, I'm super comfy.

39
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,791
[HIMENO]
Are you sure?

40
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:15,166
You're sweating a little bit.

41
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:15,875
[SHINO]
Huh?

42
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:17,250
Hey.

43
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:18,791
Would you like to go and
get some ice cream with me?

44
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:20,333
Okay!

45
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:22,250
It isn't that complicated.

46
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:24,000
Short-selling is when
you borrow shares,

47
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:25,458
sell them,
and then buy them back.

48
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:27,333
If you look at the buy
and sell rates, you'll see--

49
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:29,958
Hey, Auntie--I mean "Sis."

50
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:31,500
You'll be here
for a while, right?

51
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:34,625
Oh yeah, at this rate,
I think it'll be hours.

52
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:37,166

54
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:02,000
Hey, Tama.

55
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:04,166
Are you out running
errands with your sisters?

56
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,750
Oh, hi, Kimihara.

57
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:06,916
This is a surprise.

58
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,500
I don't see you often
outside of school.

59
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:11,333
[CHIHO] Wow! Her boobies are
a lot bigger than yours, Sis!

60
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:12,958
Please stop saying "boobies."

61
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:14,208
[MANAMI]
Girls!

62
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:18,875
It's nice to see you.
Chiho. Chinami. Chigusa.

63
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:21,083
[CHINAMI]
Can I give you a hello kiss?

64
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:23,583
[gasps]

65
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:25,083
[SHINO]
No, stop!

66
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:26,083
Stay away from her!

67
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:28,041
She's my cousin, not yours!

68
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:30,916
No one gets to kiss her but me!

69
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:34,666
You can kiss our
big sister if you want.

70
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,125
[SHINO]
No thanks.

71
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:41,166
[SHINO]
Come on!

72
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,208
Don't you know the rules?

73
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:44,083
You only kiss people
you love-love.

74
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:47,291
So, if we love-love her, does
that mean we can kiss her, too?

75
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:48,583
No way!

76
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:49,583
She loves me the most!

77
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:51,416
She doesn't need your kisses.

78
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,750
So you keep her all to yourself?

79
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:54,708
That's not nice.

80
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:55,833
You're supposed to share.

81
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:57,208
Yeah!

82
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:59,500
[CHIHO] Our big sister
kisses all three of us,

83
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:01,000
and little Sue, too.

84
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:02,750
Four times a day!

85
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:04,500
A good morning kiss.

86
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:07,375
A going to school kiss.

87
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:10,041
A welcome home from school kiss.

88
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:11,666
And a good night kiss.

89
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:16,750
Yeah, and so what if I do?

90
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:18,583
Sis, how do you know
the little girl's cousin?

91
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:20,083
Are you friends?

92
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:21,208
Yeah, sure.

93
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:22,583
I guess.

94
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:24,833
[CHINAMI] So, then, does
that mean you love-love her?

95
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:28,375
Well, I suppose it means
that I don't hate her.

96
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:31,000
Do you give her "hello" kisses,
like you do with us?

97
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:32,875
[SHINO gasps]

98
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:37,583
I don't.

99
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:38,583
[sighs]

100
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:39,666
[CHINAMI]
Why not?

101
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,250
[MANAMI]
Because we're not kids.

102
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:43,833
Girls don't kiss each other
once they've grown up.

103
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:44,958
[CHIGUSA]
Oh, really?

104
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:47,333
It's kinda true.

105
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:52,750
Huh?

106
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:55,875
Well, this is an interesting
little gathering.

107
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:57,875
That your kid sister?

108
00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:00,083
She's my cousin.

109
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:01,500
[INUKAI]
And these are?

110
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:03,583
[AKECHI] So, that cloning
thing really works, huh?

111
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:05,083
They're my little sisters.

112
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:06,916
Nice to meet you!

113
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,416
So, uh, who are you two?

114
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,750
You friends with our sister?

115
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:11,041
[AKECHI]
We sure are.

116
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:12,583
And that means
you love-love her,

117
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:14,291
but you don't kiss her.

118
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:16,208
What?

119
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:19,250
Sis told us girls don't kiss
when they're not kids anymore.

120
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:21,208
[AKECHI]
That's not true at all. Watch!

121
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:23,541
[CHIS]
Huh?

122
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:25,125
[gasps]

123
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:27,666
There, see?

124
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:30,458
Hey, keep your lips to yourself!

125
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:32,500
How could you do
that in front of kids?

126
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:34,250
[AKECHI]
Come on, what's the big deal?

127
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:35,875
You sound like an
old lady or something.

128
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:38,166
[MANAMI]
Who are you calling old lady?

129
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,500
[CHIS]
They kissed each other!

130
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:41,125
Forget you saw that!

131
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,541
[gasps]
Well, uh...

00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:46,708
[AKECHI]
See?

133
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:48,291
It doesn't matter
if you're big or little.

134
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:50,750
It's always nice to
kiss someone you love.

135
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:52,333
You mean Big Sis was wrong?

136
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:54,708
[AKECHI]
Yes, she was.

137
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:56,583
Except, the mouth.

138
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,958
You don't kiss just
anybody there, okay?

139
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:00,250
You should save
those kinds of kisses

140
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:02,916
for only one special person.

141
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,458
[ALL 4]
Hmm?

142
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:05,625
[CHIGUSA]
Is that one of those things

143
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:07,791
that'll make more sense
when we're older?

144
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:09,583
Yeah, it's one of those.

145
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:11,375
Cool! Is it something dirty?

146
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:14,708
Well, I guess it could be.

147
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:15,541
What's up?

148
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:17,041
I think I explained it well.

149
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:18,166
Oh, yeah.

150
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,208
You can kiss other
people on the cheek.

151
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:20,666
That's okay. See?

152
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,458
Like this.

153
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:23,833
[gasps]

154
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:27,541
Get back!

Uh, are we really
the type of friends

who kiss each other?

00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:34,916
We are.

158
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,958
We're totally besties.

159
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,125
You stop!

160
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:41,625
Only I kiss Hime,
'cause she love-loves me.

[AKECHI giggles]

162
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:45,458
Okay, then I'll
give <i>you</i> a smooch.

163
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:49,291
That's about enough of that.

164
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:51,125
Yeah, time to go.

165
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:54,250
Bye, kittens.

166
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:55,416
It was nice to meetcha!

167
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,291
Okay, bye!

168
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:58,791
We had fun, pervy lady!

169
00:07:58,875 --> 00:07:59,958
[sighs]

170
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:02,583
Hey, do you want a kiss?

171
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:04,125
No! Don't kiss me.

172
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:06,916
I don't love-love you.
That's yucky!

173
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:09,208
Please make her stop!

174
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:11,291
Why? It's just a kiss.

175
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:13,875
She ran away!

176
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:15,875
Come back! Hey!

177
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:16,958
[SHINO]
Stop!

178
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:18,541
Um, Shino?

179
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:20,416
[MANAMI]
Don't worry about it.

180
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,416
Playing around like that
is how kids make friends.

181
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:25,208
[SHINO]
No!

182
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:27,791
[CHIS]
Don't run away! Come back!

183
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:31,750
[MANAMI]
What's up?

184
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:33,041
It's just, watching
you with the girls,

185
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:35,000
you almost seem like a mom.

186
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:37,708
Uh-huh. Yeah, I can see that.

187
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:38,750
Careful.

188
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:40,875
Act up in class
and I'll ground you.

189
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,583
Uh, right...

190
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:45,041
[splashing]

191
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:46,333
We're gonna be
in so much trouble

192
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:49,375
when Sis catches us,
but I don't care.

193
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:56,916
Look at you, and these
are your best clothes, too.

194
00:08:57,458 --> 00:08:58,958
Taking care of
these three gives one

195
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:02,208
a new appreciation for the
struggles of moms everywhere.

196
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:03,250
Oh, yeah.

197
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:05,208
I bet it does.

198
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:06,833
Are you mad?

199
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:09,000
No, don't worry.

200
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,166
Bye-bye!

201
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,583
[CHIS]
See ya later!

202
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:17,875
I'll give you a kiss
next time, okay?

203
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:27,041
[RINO]
Did you fall in a ditch?

204
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:30,458
Where have you two been anyway?

205
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:33,125
[HIMENO] We ran into a
girl I know from school.

206
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:34,750
[MIDORIKO] What happened
to your clothes, Shino?

207
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:36,750
Sorry. It's my fault.

208
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:38,125
[MIDORIKO]
I doubt that.

209
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:40,875
For a quiet girl, she knows
how to get into trouble.

210
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:42,958
There's no warm
bathwater drawn yet.

211
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,458
You can take a shower, though.

212
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:46,791
I wanna shower with Hime!

213
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:53,041
[HIMENO]
Okay, lay your ears down.

214
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,833
Here comes the water.

215
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:00,583
[sniffs]

216
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:01,708
Do I stink?

217
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:04,125
[HIMENO]
No, you smell nice.

218
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:07,250
[SHINO] I can wash
your back if you want!

219
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:08,375
[HIMENO]
Mm-hmm.

220
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:14,958
Scrub. Scrub.

221
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:16,666
[giggles]

222
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,791
[SHINO]
Okay, rinsing now!

223
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:24,000
So, am I all clean?

224
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:25,416
[SHINO]
Uh-huh!

225
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:29,666
Huh? Uh...

226
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,166
Hime, uh...

227
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,291
Do you make milk?

228
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:35,791
No, I can't say that I do.

229
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,208
I'm kinda confused.

230
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:43,625
Huh?

231
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:46,416
That girl who kissed the
other girl in the park before.

232
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,583
I don't understand
what she was saying.

233
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:50,833
Um. Oh, I see.

234
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,583
Well, I think it'll make
more to you sense

235
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:54,291
when you're a little older.

236
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:55,500
You mean when I'm taller

237
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:58,208
and I've got boobies
as big as yours are?

238
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:17,333
Sorry about that.

239
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:18,916
It's fine.

240
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,375
[HIMENO]
Bye, Auntie...

241
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:25,708
I mean, "Sis."

242
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:27,458
Hime just call me Auntie.

243
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:31,083
Ya know, I'm not exactly
getting any younger, am I?

244
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:32,125
[HIMENO]
Night, Shino.

245
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:33,916
See ya next time.

246
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:43,000
Shino always has such a
good time with you, Hime,

247
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:45,958
but now she'll talk about
nothing but boobies for days.

248
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:48,875
[HIMENO]
Uhh... Um, what?

249
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:53,666
[PRETTY HORN]
Hang tight!

250
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:56,416
Magical Girl Pretty
Horn is up next!

251
00:11:57,333 --> 00:12:02,541
Dodgeball. Dodgeball. Dodgeball.
Dodgeball. Dodgeball. Dodgeball.

252
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:05,541
[PRETTY HORN]
That's all.

253
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:07,708
Heh! Looks like we're going
to be playing dodgeball

254
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:09,958
during every free period.

255
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:11,666
Majority rules, and all that.

256
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,958
This time, at least, yes.

257
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:16,125
However, next time,
we'll decide using a method

258
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:18,666
that reflects the will
of the minority, as well.

259
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:19,791
[ACTOR]
What?

260
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:21,666
You can't do
something like that!

261
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:25,166
Denying the majority is the
same thing as denying democracy!

262
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:28,166
[roars]

263
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,333
[PRETTY HORN]
Democratic space is distorting!

264
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:37,083
Awaken, the power of ethics!

265
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:39,583
Guide us, law and logic!

266
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:41,833
Help us to grant
the greatest happiness

267
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:44,083
to the greatest
number of people.

268
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,875
[PRETTY HORN]
Magical Girl Pretty Horn!

269
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,041
Take this! Ostrakismos!

270
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:00,708
Lift up your right arm.

271
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:02,708
Now your left arm.

272
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:03,750
Keep the right arm up.

273
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:05,541
Don't lower it.

274
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:08,000
[CHIHO]
Okay, now raise your tail.

275
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:09,541
[MANAMI sighs]

276
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:12,333
C'mon, you better put your tail
up, or you'll lose the game.

277
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,916
Enough TV, little Chis.

278
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,666
But you always let us watch
TV on Sunday mornings.

279
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:20,958
Party pooper.

280
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:22,916
It's called being responsible.

281
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,041
Anyway, I'm going
to go out for a while.

282
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:27,583
I need you three
to look after Sue.

283
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:29,416
Aw!

284
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,833
But it's the weekend.

285
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:33,166
We wanted to go out and
play with some of our friends.

286
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:36,166
[MANAMI] You know she's too
young to be home by herself.

287
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,416
Fine!

288
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,625
We'll take her
with us when we play.

289
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:40,750
[MANAMI]
That won't work.

290
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:42,250
She's too weak.

291
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:45,125
What would happen if she got
a fever while you were out?

292
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:46,166
No fair!

293
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,291
What are we supposed
to do, then?

294
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:51,041
Just stay here with Sue
and try to make the best of it.

295
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:51,958
Why us, though?

296
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:53,041
Where's Daddy?

297
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:54,708
Can't he do it?

298
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:56,750
[MANAMI]
No, he can't. He's at work.

299
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:58,000
[CHIHO]
Hold on.

300
00:13:58,083 --> 00:14:00,125
Daddy's job is to
paint pictures, isn't it?

301
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:01,583
[CHIGUSA] How's he
supposed to finish any of them

302
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:03,833
if he's never here?

303
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:05,625
That's work he does for himself.

304
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:08,041
He has a different job
that he does for money.

305
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:11,125
[CHIS] Why not have
one job that does both?

306
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:13,500
Trust me, I know it doesn't
make a lot of sense.

307
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:15,166
But that's how it is.

308
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:17,791
[CHIGUSA]
If he needs money so bad,

309
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:20,416
can't he just take some
from the offering box?

310
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,333
[MANAMI]
No.

311
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:23,416
That money belongs to the gods.

312
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,125
[CHIHO] Aren't grown-ups
supposed to stay home

313
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:27,875
and spend time with
their kids on days off?

314
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:29,541
I can't play with you today.

315
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:30,916
I wish I could.

316
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,125
Babysitting sounds
like a big responsibility.

317
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:36,750
Are you even allowed to leave
kindergartners home alone?

318
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:37,833
[MANAMI]
You may be young,

319
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:39,666
but you're resourceful
and trustworthy.

320
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,875
Besides, there are three of you.

321
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,750
Okay, we'll stay here.

322
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:46,625
Do what you need to do.

323
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:48,916
[MANAMI]
Good, I'm counting on you.

324
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:52,500
[CHINAMI] We can at least invite
a couple friends over, right?

325
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:55,333
You can, but no
roughhousing, okay?

326
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:57,750
This old house couldn't take it.

327
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,250
Hey, it's Chigusa.

328
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:05,583
Yeah. That's right.

329
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:08,500
Thing is, our sister's
making us stay home today.

330
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:09,583
Yeah, you want to?

331
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:10,875
Sounds great!

332
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:18,291
Hey, it's Chiho.

333
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:21,041
Can you--? Uh-huh.

334
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:23,833
[MANAMI] How many friends
are they going to call?

335
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,041
[MANAMI]
All right.

336
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,000
I'll be back in a little bit.

337
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:30,416
Don't open the door to
anyone you don't know.

338
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,125
[CHIGUSA]
Yeah, yeah. We won't.

339
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:34,041
[CHIS]
See you later, Sis!

340
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:44,833
[MANAMI]
You here for club stuff?

341
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:45,750
Yep.

342
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:46,916
What about you?

343
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,291
For student council.

344
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:50,375
[HIMENO]
Well, have fun.

345
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:54,875
[MANAMI]
What club is she in?

346
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:56,291
Biology?

347
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:59,041
[KIDS]
Rock, paper, scissors!

348
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:08,208
I found you!

349
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:10,458
[laughs]

350
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:12,541
[GIRL B]
Hey, wait up!

351
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:19,833
[GIRL B]
Sue, are you all right?

352
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:22,166
[GIRL B]
Over here!

353
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:30,541
Are you feeling sick?

354
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:32,250
Maybe you need a nap.

355
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:34,541
No. Wanna play more.

356
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:36,875
Just rest for a little, okay?

357
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:40,916
But I was having so much fun.

358
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,250
Don't worry, she'll be fine.

359
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:44,958
This always happens when
Sue runs around too much.

360
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:46,791
Let's play inside, though.

361
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,458
[MANAMI]
Okay, it's three o'clock.

362
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:53,000
I believe we've discussed
all there is to discuss.

363
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:55,333
The only thing left
to do is take a vote.

364
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:57,666
[BOY COUNCIL A]
I can't believe she'd stop now.

365
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,208
How can you say that?

366
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:01,125
We haven't even come
to a consensus yet.

367
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:02,666
That's right!

368
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:05,541
We need to keep talking about
this until we can all agree.

369
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:08,000
[MANAMI]
No, we decided in advance that

370
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:11,916
if an agreement wasn't reached
by three o'clock, we would vote.

371
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,416
Now, is everyone ready?

372
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,916
You can't just decide
something like that.

373
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,958
I know.

374
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:20,875
You just want to
go home, don't you?

375
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:22,833
Yes, I do. So what?

376
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:24,750
Well, that was honest.

377
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:26,458
[BOY COUNCIL A]
Are you serious?

378
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:27,833
Yes, I am.

379
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:29,000
It's the weekend.

380
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:30,750
I've already let this
deliberation carve

381
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:32,458
into my private time.

382
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:34,458
We've been at this long enough.

383
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:36,000
I need to be home
by four o'clock,

384
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:39,458
so I can make dinner for my
father and my little sisters.

385
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:42,666
Does anyone have a
problem with that?

386
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:45,416
[MANAMI]
Good. Let's vote.

387
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:52,083
[GIRL COUNCIL C]
Um, Mitama?

388
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:53,333
[MANAMI]
Hmm?

389
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:55,583
Yes? What is it?

390
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:58,000
[GIRL COUNCIL C] I understand
what you were saying back there,

391
00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:00,083
and it's not that
I don't see your side,

392
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:02,541
but being in the student
council doesn't just mean

393
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:03,875
getting stuff done.

394
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:06,333
It means working together
and learning new things,

395
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:07,833
kinda like a club.

396
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:09,208
Debates are important.

397
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:12,125
They're part of the high-school
experience, ya know?

398
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:13,791
Your point?

399
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:15,458
Just that, maybe
your family can put up

400
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:17,541
with you being late
once in a while.

401
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:18,375
[MANAMI]
They can't.

402
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:20,000
Huh?

403
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:21,541
[MANAMI]
I'll tell you a story.

404
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:24,041
My grandfather passed away,
but his whole life,

405
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:28,166
he paid more attention to
martial arts than his family.

406
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:31,125
His health failed,
and he was on his deathbed.

407
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:34,875
He called me by
my mother's name and said,

408
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:37,416
"Let's go home."

409
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:41,958
[MANAMI] Since then I've made
sure my family comes first.

410
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:44,083
Goodbye.

411
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:52,458
With 30 years'
more experience,

412
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:54,208
we might be able
to out-argue her,

413
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:56,208
but I'm not sure even
that would be enough.

414
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:57,666
Jeez, what's her problem?

415
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:00,000
She'll never succeed out
in the real world that way.

416
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:03,291
Uh, and since when are you
an expert on the real world?

417
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:04,666
[GIRL COUNCIL D]
You know it's true!

418
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:07,333
Parents can't always go
running home to their kids.

[BOY COUNCIL C chuckles]

420
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:11,666
Well, if anyone can make
it work, it's Mitama.

00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:26,125
Huh? Yeah.

424
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:27,708
[GIRL B]
We could play house together.

425
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,750
Would you like that?

[GIRL B]
Hi, I'm Mister Bear.

427

Would you like to
be my friend?

428
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:42,500
[MANAMI] How many friends
did they invite over again?

429
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:44,750
Six?

Sounds lively.

434
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:54,166
At least this means they ended
up staying in the house.

I'm home.

I'm glad you're back!

439
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:06,166
So am I. Huh?

440
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:10,583
You've been keeping Sue company?

441
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:11,583
Thanks for that.

442
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:12,458
[CHIHO]
Oh, hey.

443
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:14,666
We didn't know you were back.

444

I am, now, please explain.

445
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:19,500
Why's this girl with Sue when
it should've been you three?

446
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,500
[CHIHO] Hey, at least
we stayed home, didn't we?

447
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:23,208
[CHIGUSA]
Yeah!

448
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:24,750
Can you get us
something to eat now?

449
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:26,333
Everyone's hungry.

Yeah, sure.

Round up your friends.

00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:34,166
Hey.

453
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,666
What's the matter?

454
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:38,458
[CHIHO]
Nothing. Never mind.

455
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:41,583

Be careful going home.

00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:56,333
Have you been good today?

00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:57,375
[CHIHO]
Yeah. Sure.

462
00:20:57,458 --> 00:20:59,125
Sis left us in charge here.

463
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:01,916
Except something
kinda weird happened.

464
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,750
We invited six
friends over today,

465
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:07,000
and all six of them
were playing tag with us.

466
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:08,583
I know 'cause I counted.

467
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:12,583
But then, there was still
someone playing house with Sue.

468
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:14,166
I'm not that good at math,

469
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:17,500
but six plus one can't
equal six, can it?

470
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:20,166
Someone probably
just showed up late.

471
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,958
No. No one came that
we didn't invite,

472
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:25,750
and nobody left
early, either.

473
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:27,791
Well, maybe a Zashiki
Warashi found her way

474
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:29,583
into the group somehow.

475
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:31,958
[CHIS]
Zashiki warashi?

476

What, like a ghost or something?

478
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:39,333
[MANAMI'S DAD]
It's a nice ghost.

479

There's no reason to be scared.

480
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:43,125
They're supposed
to bring good fortune.
