The triangle block has
two triangle sides,

has two circle sides,

would be pointy,

circles would be a ball.

But you can't stack it
if it's only a circle.

and then turn it into powder.

162
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:49,041
The soba noodles we
eat are made using flour

163
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:50,375
that comes from this plant.

164
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:52,250
They're so tiny and cute.

165
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:53,791
It doesn't matter
how big they are.

166
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:56,791
Smaller flowers than these
have their own names.

167
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:58,583
This is oriental lady's thumb.

168
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:01,583
See how it has lots of
tiny red flowers on it?

169
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,583
But there's nothing
that looks like a thumb.

170
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:06,208
It seemed weird to me, too,
but with some plants,

171
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:08,375
nobody knows why they're
named the way they are.

172
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:09,875
Really? Why not?

173
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:12,000
[SHINO] Someone named
it a long time ago,

174
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:14,708
and more and more people
started calling it that,

175
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:18,666
until eventually, no one knew
how the name came about anymore.

176
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,833
[MI] The flowers have
lotsa little bumps.

177
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:21,916
[SHINO]
Uh-huh.

178
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,583
Some kids use it
when they play house,

179
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:26,375
'cause it kinda looks
like red rice.

180
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:28,583
And that's where it gets the
second name it's called by:

181
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:29,958
The red rice flower.

182
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:31,708
[MI]
You know so much, Shino!

183
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:33,541
[SHINO laughs]

184
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:34,875
[SHINO]
I only know all this stuff

185
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:37,125
because my big cousin
taught it to me.

186
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:39,166
We all have to help each other.

187
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,500
When you two are old enough,

188
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:42,666
you should teach what you
learned to younger kids.

189
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,416
That way, everyone wins!

190
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,625
[BOTH]
Mh-hm!

191
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:51,541
Hello, ma'am. Good morning!

192
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,041
Morning, Maki.

193
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:56,833
[MAKI gasps]

194
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:03,500
[MAKI]
Please, ma'am, come quick!

195
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:07,166
Someone stole
the flowers! See?

196
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,708
Oh, right here?

197
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:11,000
Those were weeds we
needed to pull up.

198
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:13,416
Who did it? Who pulled
the flowers up?

199
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,750
[TEACHER]
Maki,

200
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:18,083
I need you to put your fists
down for me, please.

201
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:20,541
[MAKI]
Shino, it's awful!

202
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:23,500
The pretty flowers are gone!

203
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:24,541
It'll be okay.

204
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,041
Even if the flowers
are all gone,

205
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,833
the seeds are still
there somewhere.

206
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:32,000
That means they'll bloom
again next fall, I promise.

207
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:34,541
And before that, there
will be spring flowers,

208
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:37,958
and when those are gone,
there will be summer flowers.

209
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:39,333
We'll be here to
watch them bloom

210
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:41,541
and learn all their
names together, okay?

211
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:43,125
'Kay.

212
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:44,750
[TEACHER]
I'm proud of you, Shino.

213
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:46,916
You'd make a very
good older sister.

214
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,750
You saw us over there looking
at the flowers yesterday,

215
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:52,416
but you still pulled
them all up anyhow?

216
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,750
Uh, I saw, but, well,
it had to be done.

217
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:59,958
[I get it. It's
grown-up stuff, right?

218
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:02,541
I hope I get to be
a grown-up soon, too.

219
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:05,125
[chuckles]

220
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:17,458
[HIMENO] All of these pointed
shapes are called pyramids.

221
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:21,166
When all sides are triangles,
it's a triangular pyramid.

222
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,583
One with a square bottom
is a square pyramid.

223
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:25,666
One with a round
bottom is a cone.

224
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:28,666
Long ones with ends of the
same thickness are prisms.

225
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:32,791
This one here is a cylinder,
and that's a triangular prism.

226
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:35,458
Little kids always ask
so many questions.

227
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:38,375
It's really hard
being a big sister.

228
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:40,500
You must've studied
a long time, Hime.

229
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:42,500
It seems like you
know everything.

230
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:44,166
Thank you.

231
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,250
But you know, there's
still plenty of stuff

232
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:48,000
I have to learn about, too.

233
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:49,458
[SHINO sighs]

234
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:50,958
[SHINO]
Huh.

235
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,291
[SUE]
There.

236
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:20,000
[SUE]
Down. Go down.

237
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:24,458
How's it goin', Sue?
You all dressed yet?

238
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:27,375
There we go! Found your tail.

239
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:35,541
I wanted to get dressed
by myself, but--

240
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:37,666
What's taking so long?

241
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:38,791
Poor thing.

242
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:40,666
She was having trouble
getting her tail

243
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,541
through the hole in her outfit.

244
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:44,375
[SUE]
Mew.

245
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:50,583
That settles it. It's time for
some special tail training!

246
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:52,833
What's tail training?

247
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:58,625
This'll be easy. All you gotta
do is follow my lead, okay?

248
00:12:58,708 --> 00:12:59,958
[SUE]
Mh-hm!

249
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:02,458
[RIRI]
Chisters, you wanna play?

250
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:08,083
Right.

251
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:10,166
Now, to the left.

252
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,541
Back to the middle.

253
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,583
And down.

254
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:20,083
Hey, guys. So what's up?

255
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,541
[CHINAMI]
Learning about tails.

256
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:25,458
Studying hard, Sue?
I'm proud of you.

257
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:27,041
Meow.

258
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:28,500
[CHINAMI]
Wanna study with us, Riri?

259
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:31,416
Uh, sure, what do I do?

260
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,666
Swing your tail from
the right into a circle.

261
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:37,000
Like this.

262
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:38,083
Really?

263
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:40,208
Yeah, looks tough.

264
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:45,125
[SUE]
Mew.

265
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:47,583
I'm not sure I would
call that a circle.

266
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:49,708
I don't know if anyone
could do those kinda tricks

267
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:53,916
without having tails that are
as long as you Chisters' are.

268
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,375
Don't worry, you're doing fine.

269
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:58,916
It's okay if you can't
make a fancy circle.

270
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,375
[CHINAMI]
Look, two circles.

271
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:02,375
Mew?

272
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:04,375
That's pretty cool.

273
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:09,500
[BOTH]
Meow!

274
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:13,333
Riri, you're here?

275
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:15,250
I came over to play.

276
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:22,375
Sissy. Why's my tail so short?

277
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:23,666
Your tail's fine.

278
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:26,000
You know, Sue, your
sisters' tails were short

279
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:29,875
when they were little, too.

280
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:32,416
See? Look how small they were.

281
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,166
They had flat ears, too.

282
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,958
Wait a minute why were we
dressed up all funny looking?

283
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:38,750
[SUE]
They look cute!

284
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:40,125
Yes, they do.

285
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:43,125
I was the one who picked out
their clothes back then.

286
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:51,166
Yeah, but still, why those?

287
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,833
Wouldn't it have been
easier to dress us

288
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:56,916
in those special baby
pants that just snap on?

289
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,083
It's a lot more complicated
with pants and skirts.

290
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:02,375
The tail has to go
through two holes.

291
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:05,750
I guess you could just not
put it through the hole.

292
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:11,791
I don't think you would be very
comfortable in pants, though.

293
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:15,125
It would cause even more
problems with a skirt.

294
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,625
I guess with a kimono,
there's a way to wear them

295
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:20,541
that keeps the tail
inside, but even then,

296
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:23,708
it still has to go through a
specially designed tail holder.

297
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:26,000
Still, what about
those baby pants,

298
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:28,291
like Chiho said before?

299
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:33,875
[MANAMI] The snaps on
those come undone easily.

300
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:36,875
Remember when that happened
to Sue and she fell?

301
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,458
[MANAMI] At any rate,
if you want your tail

302
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:42,625
outside your clothes,

303
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:44,666
you need something
called an undertag.

304
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,458
[CHIHO]
Okay, what's that?

305
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:50,000
[MANAMI] It's a loose piece
of cloth inside a skirt.

306
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:52,583
[CHIGUSA]
'Kay. So what are they for?

307
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:55,291
[MANAMI] Without one, if you
moved your tail to the side,

308
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:58,125
your underwear would
show through the hole.

309
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:00,125
[MANAMI] An undertag fills
in the extra space

310
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:02,125
so your underwear stays hidden.

311
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:04,541
[CHIGUSA] I don't care
if it shows a little.

312
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:06,125
Well, I do care.

313
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:08,500
[CHIGUSA]
Why? You don't even have a tail.

314
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:10,958
I don't want your
underwear to be visible.

315
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:14,333
Not to the kinds of
people who would look.

316
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:19,583
Sissy. Um, were you
little like me?

317
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:22,250
I was little.

318
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:24,583
Here, look. This is me.

319
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:27,750
[CHIGUSA]
You're so cute!

320
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:29,958
[CHINAMI]
Tiny Big Sis!

321
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:32,500
[CHIHO]
You looked just like Sue.

322
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:35,541
If you used to be so adorable,

323
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:37,583
then why didn't you
stay that way?

324
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:39,791
Can we give you a makeover?

325
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:41,500
If I had stayed cute.

326
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,375
I wouldn't be able
to make dinner,

327
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:46,083
or look out for the four of you.

328
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:49,083
Everyone has to grow
up sometime.

329
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:51,208
[CHIS]
Poo, poo!

330
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:53,625
[MANAMI]
Oh? You don't want dinner, then?

331
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:56,375
[CHIS]
No, we didn't say that!

332
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:03,833
As you can see, our next
topic of discussion

333
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:06,916
is the recent "World's
Prettiest Person Contest."

334
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,833
This "festival of beauty"
began as a symbol of peace.

335
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:10,208
What's this about?

336
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:12,625
The World's Prettiest
Person Contest.

337
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:14,375
That's easy.

338
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:17,833
It's gotta be Sissy, right?
She's the prettiest.

339
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:21,291
[CHINAMI, CHIGUSA shouting]

340
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:23,208
[MANAMI]
Hey!

341
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:26,291
You know there's no horsing
around in the house.

342
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:29,458
Sissy.

343
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:32,083
What is it, Sue?

344
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:34,458
Well? What's up?

345
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,625
You're the prettiest person
in the whole wide world.

346
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:44,000
Aren't you sweet?

347
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:46,125
Careful. Don't say that.

348
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:48,708
Yeah! You'll give
her a big head.

349
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:50,291
[MANAMI]
Uhh...

350
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:52,250
[CHIHO] There's always
somebody who's better.

351
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:53,583
[CHINAMI]
Yeah, Big Sis seems like

352
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:55,541
the most important person
in the world, right?

353
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:58,000
[CHIGUSA] But there are even
more important people out there

354
00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:00,333
that you have to listen
to, like teachers.

355
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:04,291
That's true.
And don't forget Dad.

356
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,458
[ALL]
Hmm...

357
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:09,666
[MANAMI] I didn't think that
would require so much thought.

358
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,833
[ALL]
You're saying Daddy's important?

359
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:14,583
He's the most important
person in this house.

360
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:18,333
Well, anyway, there must be
somebody who's prettier, too.

361
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:21,666
Then let's hear it. Who do you
think is prettier than me?

362
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:22,958
Who?

363
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:40,541
[gapss]

364
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:41,916
[ALL yelp]

365
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,625
[KIDS gasping]

366
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:46,666
[GIRL C]
Wow! That was really great!

367
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:50,083
Hey, there. Are you all right?

368
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:52,666
You three really need
to be more careful.

369
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,541
[CHINAMI, CHIGUSA]
Meow.

370
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:58,166
You know, Miss Ryuko, you're
actually really pretty.

371
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:01,833
What? Trying to distract
me with flattery?

372
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:03,000
[CHINAMI]
Hm.

373
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:08,666
But still, our sister's
prettier. Sorry to tell ya that.

374
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,416
That's okay, dear.

375
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,333
[CHIS sigh]

376
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:15,541
[CHIS]
Close but no cigar.

377
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:20,416
[TEACHER] Try not to be
too upset with them.

378
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,250
[RYUKO]
I'm not upset!

379
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:24,500
Of course no one can hold
a candle to the big sister

380
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:26,875
who's practically
a mother to them.

381
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:42,333
I guess there aren't many
pretty people around, huh?

382
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:46,458
[CHINAMI]
Huh?

383
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:47,875
[CHIGUSA, CHIHO]
Huh?

384
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:50,666
[CHIS] Hey, it's Shino and
all her big sisters, too!

385
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:53,583
Hey. It's Prez's little sisters.

386
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:58,666
[ALL chuckling]

387
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:03,583
Be careful. I might drop ya.

388
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:04,333
[CHIHO chuckles]

389
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:06,208
Will you pick me up?

390
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:08,166
You three love attention, huh?

391
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,583
[SHINO]
Hey! Me, too!

392
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:12,500
Come here then.

393
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:17,958
You're totally cute,

394
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:20,375
but I don't think I would call
you pretty, at least not yet.

395
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:23,500
You will probably be
pretty someday, though.

396
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:25,375
My Hime's already pretty!

397
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:26,666
Aww.

398
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:31,291
Hey, I bet you're really pretty

399
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:34,541
back home in
Antarctica, aren'tcha?

400
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:37,041
I'm not sure, but if you
wanna come over here,

401
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:38,833
I can pick you up.

402
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:45,208
Y'know, you're kinda
pretty yourself, Shino.

403
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:47,291
But you're still
just a kid, so...

404
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:49,583
Hey, you're still a kid, too.

405
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:52,291
So, what? You three are out
looking for pretty people?

406
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:55,125
[CHIHO]
Mh-hm. Mh-hm.

407
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:57,916
Okay. What do you
think of her, then?

408
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,291
[CHIGUSA yelling]

409
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:02,875
[CHIGUSA]
Again! Again!

410
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:05,000
So you're actually a girl?

411
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:07,208
I thought you were a
boy this whole time.

412
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:08,875
Hey, you saw me
in my bathing suit

413
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:10,666
at the swimming pool!

414
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:14,291
[CHIS]
Sis, we're back!

415
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,583
[MANAMI]
Oh, there you are.

416
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:23,333
It was getting dark, so I was
about to go looking for you.

417
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:26,708
[ALL] We've been out searching
all day, like, everywhere.

418
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:28,125
Yeah, for what?

419
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:30,791
[ALLI] Well, duh. For someone
who's prettier than you.

420
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:31,375
[MANAMI]
Find one?

421
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:34,250
[ALL]
Um...

422
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:36,000
No. Meow.

423
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:38,458
[CHINAMI]
Still, it's a really big world!

424
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:42,208
That's right. I'm sure there's
somebody prettier out there.

425
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:44,958
Can't you just say I'm the
prettiest and leave it at that?

426
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:47,750
[CHINAMI] No! Then you'll think
you don't have to try anymore!

427
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:50,458
[CHIGUSA] And you'll become
an old lady before you know it.

428
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:52,750
I've got a few years
till I'm past my prime,

429
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:56,583
and by then, you three and
Sue will be the prettiest.

430
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:58,500
We're gonna be pretty?

431
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:02,083
Yes, if you're good girls
who always do what you're told.

432
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:05,250
Why does talking to you
always end with a lecture?
