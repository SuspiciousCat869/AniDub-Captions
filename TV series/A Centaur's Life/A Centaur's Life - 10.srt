1
00:01:46,833 --> 00:01:49,666
[HIMENO]
Sorry! Were you waiting long?

2
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:52,625
[NOZOMI] Ah! Nice.
I'm liking the disguise.

3
00:01:52,708 --> 00:01:54,166
[chuckles]

4
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:57,416
Although, I've gotta admit,
you still just look like Hime.

5
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:01,000
Hard to hide the centaur thing.

6
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:03,041
Eh, don't worry about it.

7
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:16,291
[KYOKO] All right, it's just
about time. Shall we?

8
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:18,250
[HIMENO]
But we still have 15 minutes.

9
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:22,208
Yeah, except Nakafumi always
arrives 15 minutes early.

10
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:26,250
Hey, you're getting the
whole check? That's awesome.

11
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:27,708
You'll pay me back later.

12
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:29,875
Keep your eyes on the street.

13
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,250
[NOZOMI]
Uh.

14
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:34,625
You weren't kidding about
him being super early.

15
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,541
Right, they're on the move.

16
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:42,666
I dunno about this.

17
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,958
We have to make sure
that no mistakes happen.

18
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:46,791
Mistakes? Like what?

19
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,375
Do we have to spell it out?

20
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:51,500
As her friends, it's up to us
to prevent sexual indiscretions.

21
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:52,791
[gasps]

22
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,916
No! They wouldn't!

23
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,083
Shush!

24
00:02:57,166 --> 00:02:58,791
Now, let's go.

25
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:05,083
Are you excited to go to the
contemporary arts museum?

26
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:21,541
[SPY C]
Target is now on the move.

27
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:24,291
Unidentified pursuers confirmed.

28
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:33,750
I should search our
database of known terrorists.

29
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:35,041
Not necessary.

30
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:37,250
Those girls are the
target's classmates.

31
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:40,500
They're playing a childish
prank. Just ignore it.

32
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:41,875
We've got company.

33
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:43,541
Public Security, the military,

34
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:45,625
the Cabinet Research
Office, of course.

35
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:48,708
The CIA. The FSB. A whole crowd.

36
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:51,875
So all the usual
players are here.

37
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:55,125
Take no action unless
absolutely necessary.

38
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,375
[SUU]
I'm a little confused.

39
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:24,583
Do humans find this sort of
thing pleasant to observe?

40
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:28,083
Visual enjoyment isn't really
the point of contemporary art.

41
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:29,750
At least, I think.

42
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:32,750
Honestly, I don't know
that much about it.

43
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:35,541
I find it interesting, though.

44
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:39,208
For most people, art means the
creation of beautiful things

45
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:40,916
through painting
and other mediums.

46
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,916
A long time ago, only the
wealthy and privileged

47
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,708
could buy or make art.

48
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:48,916
A person couldn't simply go down
to the local stationary shop

49
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,625
and purchase a tube of paint.

50
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:54,416
But times changed and
so did technology.

51
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,416
Photography emerged, offering
a way to capture images

52
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,833
more accurately
than any painting.

53
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:01,875
The industrial age
arrived, and with it,

54
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:04,208
the ability to mass-produce
highly-detailed

55
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:07,041
and precise models
inexpensively.

56
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:09,833
When the beauty that was
previously rare and precious

57
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:11,458
became commonplace,

58
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:13,750
demand emerged for a
different kind of beauty.

59
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:16,125
Accurate reproduction
of items and people

60
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:17,416
were no longer enough.

61
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,833
Take the Interstellar Wars
movies, for example.

62
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:21,416
An immense budget
may have resulted

63
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,125
in more realistic
special effects,

64
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:25,458
but that doesn't
translate into beauty.

65
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:28,125
So people began to paint
things in subjective ways

66
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:30,291
that no photograph could convey.

67
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:32,916
Some Western artists borrowed
aspects from African art,

68
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,958
which had previously
been viewed as primitive.

69
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:39,416
Artists began to challenge the
very standards of beauty itself,

70
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,666
creating abstract paintings that
seemed to depict nothing at all.

71
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:45,041
But even those were still
aesthetically pleasing,

72
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:46,833
however strange.

73
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:48,625
That too was lost, however,

74
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:51,416
when people began putting
ordinary items on display

75
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,208
and calling them art.

76
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,833
And now it's all about changing
the meaning of art in context.

77
00:05:57,916 --> 00:05:59,291
Like a game or race.

78
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:01,583
Who can change the rules first?

79
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:05,625
That's my take, but like I said,
I'm not an expert or anything.

80
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:07,625
What, specifically,
is that context?

81
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:08,875
[NAKAFUMI]
Uhh...

82
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:10,791
I'm not sure.

83
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:16,041
Of course no one's going
to give up that secret.

84
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,375
Anybody who knew the answer

85
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:19,333
could make a
fortune as an artist.

86
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:21,166
The art world is cutthroat.

87
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,500
Really?

88
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:24,291
There's a secret out there
that's that important?

89
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:25,500
Who knows?

90
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:27,708
But if there was,
it would be invaluable.

91
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:30,791
We are talking about
putting a price on reality.

92
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:33,166
Hey, it looks like
they're moving on.

93
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:45,583
A date at an art museum, huh?

94
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:47,916
This guy's got some class.

95
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:55,500
What d'you think? Is Suu
actually enjoying this?

96
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:56,750
[KYOKO]
Good question.

97
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,625
Who knows if art is even
a part of her culture.

98
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:02,125
So what kind of art
is there in Antarctica?

99
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:04,583
[SUU]
Hm.

100
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:08,583
We do have drawings, but
they're more like schematics.

101
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:10,375
I suppose the way
humans look at art

102
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:12,666
is the same way we view
logical expressions

103
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,583
and numerical formulas.

104
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:18,250
They're said to be beautiful in
their brevity and precision.

105
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:19,625
Oh, I'm sorry.

106
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:22,375
Maybe you would've preferred
a traditional museum.

107
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:25,875
Oh, no. I can make
sense of those on my own.

108
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:26,833
But art?

109
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:28,208
To understand that,

110
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:30,666
it helps if I have somebody
looking at it with me.

111
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,291
I don't know if I'm
really the best person

112
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:34,541
to explain this stuff to you.

113
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:36,166
It's fascinating, truly.

114
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,333
I like hearing your
views on the subject.

115
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,583
You don't have to be an expert.

116
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,166
Hey, watch it. Oh!

117
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,166
That you, Princess?

118
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,833
You recognized me, huh?

119
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:05,458
[MANAMI]
Um.

120
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:06,750
[HIMENO]
Uh?

121
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:15,750
You on a date?

122
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:17,500
Hey, do you know what that is?

123
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:19,708
[HIMENO]
Huh?

124
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:22,000
Hmm...

125
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:23,333
No idea.

126
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:25,125
[NOZOMI]
Hime, they're moving!

127
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:26,666
[gasps]

128
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,166
Well, bye.

129
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:33,208
[HIMENO]
Sorry about that.

130
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:35,541
Wait, is that the Class
Prez with Omaki?

131
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:36,750
[HIMENO]
Yeah.

132
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:39,083
Did they come to the
museum on a date, too?

133
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:41,583
Think so.

134
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:44,666
Can we stay focused on
the date we came here for?

135
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:13,125
Doesn't look like they're
heading for the station.

136
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:15,333
[KYOKO]
But that way leads to...

137
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:16,666
[ALL gasp]

138
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:19,416
The sun is going down.

139
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,791
Why isn't this
date over already?

140
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:24,666
Don't get caught up
in the nightlife, kids.

141
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:32,291
[gasps]

142
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:34,208
They aren't!

143
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:36,333
They are. I knew it.

144
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:37,833
[groans]

145
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:39,458
Just great.

146
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:40,750
What do we do?

147
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:43,041
[NOZOMI]
Is there anything we can do?

148
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:44,416
How do we stop this?

149
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,041
Get one of our guys
to the front desk

150
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:47,958
with a fake police badge.

151
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:50,208
Have them cite the Juvenile
Protection Ordinance

152
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:51,708
and kick the kids out.

153
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:54,375
Okay, but what's to stop them
from going someplace else?

154
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:56,833
We'll just have
to play it by ear.

155
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:07,333
[NOZOMI]
Almost there!

156
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:09,041
[HIMENO]
I can't look.

157
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:10,375
[KYOKO]
I can.

158
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:14,416
[SHIGETOKI]
Don't do it.

159
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:19,416
Keep walking!

Too bad, huh?

[sighs]

164
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:38,958
So a used bookstore.

165
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:41,208
Seems this guy's quite
the intellectual.

166
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:43,125
No kidding.

167
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:44,958
It's a book about
contemporary art.

168
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:47,666
Maybe it'll help us
understand a little better.

169
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:02,916
[HIMENO] So how did
your date go yesterday?

170
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:05,750
It was lovely.

171
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:07,291
He showed me some very
interesting things.

172
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,666
Wow! Really, like what?

173
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,541
We went to a museum,

174
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:15,708
one that exhibited contemporary
art, which I didn't understand.

175
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:17,208
It was nice.

176
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:19,875
It's still a novelty for me to
not understand something.

177
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:22,250
What did you think
of it, Himeno?

178
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:23,583
Oh, me?

179
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:26,541
Well, I found it pretty
confusing, too.

180
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:28,416
All that abstract stuff
is tough to get.

181

--[KYOKO] Huh?

[SUU]
I'm sorry...

186
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:37,333
[MANAMI]
Thanks for yesterday.

187
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:38,875
Please, I had a great time.

188
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:40,666
[MANAMI]
Yeah. Me too.

189
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:44,500
We should do it again. Really,
thank you for everything.

190
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:45,791
Sure, of course.

191
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:47,250
[KYOKO]
Oh, never mind.

192
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:49,125
[SUU]
Did I miss something?

193
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:56,083
Really? So you're going out?

194
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:58,583
Yes, I am. Keep
an eye on things.

195
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:01,291
Of course, with Dad home today,
I'm sure you'll be fine.

196
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:02,458
Have fun, okay?

197
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:04,375
No, we're not gonna have fun!

198
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:07,083
All he ever does is
sit around and paint.

199
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:08,500
He's a painter.

Hey.

You her date?

204
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:14,250
I guess so.

205

You're good looking
enough. You'll do.

206
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:18,166
Uh, thanks.

207
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,500
Still, Sis, leaving the
kids at home on the weekend

208
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:22,791
to go out on a secret
tryst with a boy?

209
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,958
Isn't that some kind
of child abuse?

210
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:28,750
"Tryst"? Really? And I'm
not a boy. I'm a girl.

211
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:31,583
I won't be gone very long.
I'll be back in time for dinner.

Yes, we are. Take care

I say about that face?

See you soon, little Chis.

[OMAKI] Getting outta

00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:58,000
[MANAMI]
Seriously.

223
00:12:58,083 --> 00:13:00,208
[OMAKI] You're lucky
you've got little sisters.

224
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:01,791
Little brothers are a handful.

Yeah, I don't know.

I feel like raising little boys
might be more straightforward.

Uh, I wouldn't be
so sure about that.

This is kind of embarrassing.

It's not a big deal
if it's two girls.

Are they models?

With stuff like this,

243
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:52,291
you sometimes spend longer
reading the explanation

244
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:53,791
than actually
looking at the art.

'Cause if you don't,
you won't understand it.

It doesn't look like
they're on a date.

a smoke break right now.

276
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:20,375
If I were a smoker.

277
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:22,083
Drinking's out of the question.

278
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:25,958
Gambling has never held
much interest for me.

279
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:29,125
And there's no way I'd ever take
my frustration out on the kids.

280

Even when I do paint,
nothing sells.

281
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:35,750
But I just can't bring
myself to give it up.

There's no way out for me.

Uh.

I didn't understand
anything here.

I think I need more
thorough explanations.

[OMAKI] Look at this.
They sell sweets here, too.

There's enough in
here for everyone.

Here. A little something
for the kiddos.

291
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:02,541
No, I can't.

292
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:05,000
Please, I'm the one who dragged
you here in the first place.

293
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:07,791
Hey, don't get all
uptight on me now.

294
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:10,583
It just doesn't feel
right to accept a gift

295
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:13,166
from someone who doesn't
have a steady income.

296
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,416
Come on.

297
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,833
I do actually get paid
a bit for helping out

298
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:18,750
with the family business,
so don't sweat it.

299
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:20,875
And besides, I promised
I'd get souvenirs

300
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:22,458
for the Chisters, remember?

301
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:25,166
I'll be in trouble if
I don't follow through.

302
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,291
Just take them, 'kay?

303
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:30,000
Fine. I will, thank you.

304
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:36,166
So if what we saw here today
qualifies as contemporary art,

305
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,375
I'm guessing that means

306
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:39,583
your Dad's a little
behind the times, huh?

307
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,666
That's a harsh assessment.

308
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,500
Although, it's also
an accurate one.

309
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:46,291
I'm not an art
expert or anything,

310
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:48,708
but if he wants to sell,

311
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:51,875
he should paint stuff that's
more surreal or edgy.

312
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:55,333
He could even quit painting and
try performance art instead.

313
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:57,833
Something provocative
and attention-grabbing.

314
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:01,166
Like throwing a nationalist
up in the air, maybe.

315
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,583
Yeah, I don't know.

316
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:05,083
I mean, it's not as if he
can do whatever he wants

317
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:06,541
and be able to call it art.

318
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,583
[OMAKI]
That's not what I'm suggesting.

319
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:10,000
I'm just saying,

320
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:12,625
he should try to challenge
some established concept.

"A true artist's work
will question--

00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:16,833
and sometimes invalidate--
social ideals,

323
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:18,333
and those who look
at it are freed

324
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:20,500
from the shackles
of preconception."

325
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:22,541
Y'know? Stuff like that.

326
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,666
[MANAMI] But rather than
invalidating social ideals,

327
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,458
isn't that type of
artist just attempting

328
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:30,583
to replace existing
ones with his own?

329
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:32,166
There's the appearance
of freedom,

330
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,166
but if you look closely,
you see the shackles

331
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,458
have just been hidden.

332
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:37,791
This is getting a little
too deep for me.

333
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:40,375
[MANAMI]
Honestly, I'm a bit lost, too.

334
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:41,833
It's funny.

335
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:44,291
For all that my father says
he wants to be an artist,

336
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:46,333
I don't think he means it.

337
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:47,500
Wait, he doesn't?

338
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:50,166
Now you're starting
to confuse me.

339
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:53,916
What my father really wants
is just to be a painter.

340
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,291
Which means he's an artist.

341
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,416
[MANAMI]
No, it's different.

342
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,375
All he wants is to
paint simple pictures.

343
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:05,416
Nothing fancy. Nothing
avant-garde or abstract.

344
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,375
Just plain realism.

345
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:10,208
[OMAKI] Okay, then why not
become an illustrator?

346
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:12,000
Good question.

347
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:13,958
Some of his paintings
have actually been used

348
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:16,375
as book covers before.

349
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:20,000
But a career illustrator
doesn't decide what to draw.

350
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:21,916
They have to do what
they're told, you know?

351
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,625
And he wants creative freedom?

352
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:25,083
[MANAMI]
Yes.

353
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:27,500
Besides, it's a surprisingly
competitive field.

354
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:29,208
There are high schoolers
who are pretty good

355
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:30,666
and willing to work for less.

356
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,125
[OMAKI] So why doesn't he
just leave it as a hobby?

357
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:36,333
He can't! That's
totally unacceptable!

358
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:39,583
[sighs]

359
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:41,750
[OMAKI]
But why?

360
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:43,458
If I said it was a hobby,

361
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:44,958
that would be like
telling my father

362
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:48,375
that his art will only ever
be worth doing for fun.

363
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:50,916
It would kill any hope he has.

364
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,875
He's been pouring his energy
and passion into painting

365
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:56,291
for longer than I've
even been alive.

366
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:58,375
I can't take that from him.

367
00:18:58,458 --> 00:18:59,666
[OMAKI]
Okay, well,

368
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,458
if he is that
passionate about it,

369
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:03,208
then he has to be
willing to compromise,

370
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:05,083
accept the bad along
with the good.

371
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:06,958
Uh.

372
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:08,333
Yeah, maybe.

373
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:10,375
Take a sport, like baseball.

374
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:12,916
It isn't enough to practice
just batting and catching.

375
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,625
You have to do
boring stuff, too.

376
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:16,708
Like cardio and
strength training.

377
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:18,500
Artists tend to think
compromising

378
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:20,291
damages their integrity.

379
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:22,416
I don't think my father
could handle that.

380
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,833
[OMAKI]
You know, Tama.

381
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:28,250
I hate to say it, but you're
too soft on your dad.

382
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,916
[gasps]

383
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,625
[MANAMI]
That's ridiculous!

384
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:34,625
[OMAKI] What was it people used
to call you? Miss Perfect?

385
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:37,125
[MANAMI] Yeah, that was my
nickname in middle school.

386
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:38,000
That's right.

387
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:39,625
Remember our Home Ec. teacher?

388
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:43,333
She said you were the most ready
one of us to raise a family.

389
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:44,375
Your point?

390
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:46,083
[OMAKI]
You're mature for your age,

391
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:48,083
but you're still a kid,
same as me.

392
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:50,041
You haven't been in
the real world yet.

393
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:52,250
What do you truly know about it?

394
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:54,625
Does it make sense for a
kid still in high school

395
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:57,666
to be planning out an
adult's life for him?

396
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:00,500
Well, no. I guess not.

397
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:02,208
[OMAKI]
Your dad's not a child.

398
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:07,208
He can think things through
and make up his own mind.

399
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:08,916
Maybe the best way
to show your support

400
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,166
is by having faith in him.

401
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:15,875
You're right. Thank you.

402
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:20,750
Hey, it's no problem.
Talk to me anytime.

403
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:23,416
Oh, whoops. It's later
than I thought.

404
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,791
[OMAKI]
Ready to get going?

405
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:26,125
[MANAMI]
Mh-hm.

406
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,708
Hey, girls!

407
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:32,291
[CHIS]
Big Sis is home!

408
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:34,916
Ss promised.
Koma got it for all of you.

409
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,916
[CHIS] Yay! A souvenir!
We got a present!

410
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,333
[MANAMI]
I'll have dinner ready soon.

411
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:46,833
Dinner's ready. You coming?

412
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:49,916
[MANAMI'S DAD] Thanks,
but I don't know if I can stop.

413
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,833
I'm, uh, kind of
in a groove, here.

414
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:56,625
Don't knock yourself out.

415
00:20:56,708 --> 00:21:00,541
Okay. Um, yeah, sure.

416
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:08,458
[MANAMI] You don't know what
will come of your painting.

417
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:12,333
If you ruin your health, too,
you'll have nothing left.

418
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:16,916
[MANAMI]
I may not know much about art,

419
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,375
but I think it's
a nice painting.

420
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:25,500
Well, first we went to a museum,

421
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:28,125
one that exhibited
contemporary artwork.

422
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:31,333
I didn't understand it,
but that was nice for once.

423
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:33,625
What did you think of
the exhibit, Himeno?

424
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:36,500
[HIMENO] Well, I found
it pretty confusing, too.

425
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:38,791
All that abstract stuff
is tough to get.

426
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:39,708
[NOZOMI]
Hey!

427
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:41,666
[HIMENO]
You knew we were there?

428
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:44,208
[SUU] I'm sorry, but you do
kind of stand out, Himeno.

429
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:46,666
[NOZOMI] Jeez, way to blow
it for the rest of us, Hime.

430
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:47,583
[HIMENO]
Sorry! I didn't mean to.

431
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:49,333
[OMAKI]
Good morning.

432
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:52,041
[MANAMI] Good morning.
Thanks for yesterday.

433
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:53,833
Please, I had a great time.

434
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:55,625
Yeah. Me too.

435
00:21:55,708 --> 00:22:00,583
We should do it again. Really,
thank you for everything.

436
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:04,833
[OMAKI]
Sure, of course.
