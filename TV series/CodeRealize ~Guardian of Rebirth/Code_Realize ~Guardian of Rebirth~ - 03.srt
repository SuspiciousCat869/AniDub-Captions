1
00:00:12,666 --> 00:00:14,875
I understand.

2
00:00:14,958 --> 00:00:16,375
Thanks anyway.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,083
[VAN]
Not enough information.

4
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:28,375
I guess we're going to have to
use the Horologium as bait.

5
00:00:28,458 --> 00:00:31,250
[whistle blowing]

6
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:32,625
[OFFICER A]
It's the Phantom Thief!

7
00:00:32,708 --> 00:00:33,750
[OFFICER B]
Get him!

8
00:00:34,916 --> 00:00:35,875
[gasps]

9
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,541
Those two have grown
so close to each other.

10
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:21,500
[IMPEY] I still can't get
that mutt to play with me!

11
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:23,125
Heh. Sisi. Look at you, boy.

12
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:25,000
Stop flirting with her already!

13
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:26,083
[SISI growls]

14
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:27,583
[IMPEY yelps]

15
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:30,416
[IMPEY] Ha-ha. Relax, I was
kidding! It was just a joke!

16
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,000
[IMPEY laughs]

17
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:37,166
Uh, hey. Van.

18
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:38,500
Oh, right.

19
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:41,625
Lupin left earlier. Don't
know when he'll be back.

20
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:44,000
Here have a seat.

21
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:46,416
If you want breakfast,
there's plenty for you, too.

22
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,250
[VAN]
Your cooking isn't to my taste.

23
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:52,083
Come on, you haven't
even tried it yet!

24
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:57,291
Good morning, Van.

25
00:02:57,375 --> 00:02:59,708
Huh? What gives?

26
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,625
[SAINT chuckles]

27
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:08,875
I almost forgot.

28
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:11,666
There's an interesting
article in the paper.

29
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:14,625
[CARDIA] "Phantom thief
under the moon appears.

30
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:17,625
Flying in the sky and
disappearing like a fog"?

31
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:19,875
[IMPEY]
Huh. So he's back?

32
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:21,000
[SAINT]
Uh-huh.

33
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:22,458
He's following the same pattern,

34
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:25,333
employing the exact
same methods as before.

35
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:26,916
There's more to the story, too.

36
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,125
They say he's been targeting
vampire family treasures.

37
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:31,583
Wait, vampire?

38
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:33,625
[SAINT] They're a type of
demi-human with remarkable

39
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:36,791
physical abilities and
incredibly long lifespans.

40
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:40,416
They're rather mysterious.
And widely feared, as well.

41
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,291
Oh, I see.

42
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:45,000
I bet you know quite
a bit about them.

43
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:47,250
Van Helsing the "Hero."

44
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:48,958
[VAN]
Hmph.

45
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:50,208
Generally speaking,

46
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:52,458
vampire treasures are
rather valuable items,

47
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:54,791
which makes them a
perfect target for theft.

48
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:56,125
The Yard's been on high alert,

49
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:58,708
so I wonder how this guy
manages to pull it off.

50
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:02,250
This Phantom Thief is giving
Lupin a run for his money!

51
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:05,166
Speak of the Devil
and he will appear.

52
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,000
[CARDIA] Welcome back,
Lupin. How are you?

53
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:09,541
[IMPEY] That grumpy man in
the glasses is waiting for you.

54
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:11,583
[LUPIN]
Oh. I see.

55
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:15,291
I'm glad everyone is
here at the same place.

56
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:18,458
As a matter of fact,
the timing is spot on.

57
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,958
[BOTH] You want to capture the
train that Finis is riding?

58
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:24,333
That's right.

59
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:27,166
He's boarding a train to
London in two weeks time.

60
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,708
It's perfect.

61
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:31,250
He's going to be inspecting a
war plant on the north side.

62
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:32,958
This plan will work.

63
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:34,166
Finis will be all ours

64
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,833
and Twilight won't even
know what hit them.

65
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:39,333
I'm not saying I'm on board
with Impey's crazy idea,

66
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:41,166
but I definitely think
this is the fastest way

67
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,875
to get the info
we're looking for.

68
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:44,875
Not just about Twilight's
terrorist plot,

69
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:46,458
but about Issac, too.

70
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:48,791
Count me in! Let's do this!

71
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:51,916
Well, I certainly didn't think
we'd be hijacking a train.

72
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,375
But it sounds like a
perfect opportunity to me.

73
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:58,083
I'm curious, how did you
get that information?

74
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:00,833
That's top secret.
You have an inside source?

75
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:02,000
[LUPIN chuckles]

76
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:04,083
I'm the Gentleman
Thief, remember?

77
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:06,708
There's a reason
they call me that.

78
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:09,500
There's nothing I
can't steal, Van.

79
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:14,208
[LUPIN] Whether it's a jewel,
a person, a piece of art,

80
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:16,333
or classified information.

81
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:19,666
[LUPIN]
During his inspection,

82
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:23,000
security will be weakest
when he's on the train.

83
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:25,833
If we work together,
I know we can pull this off.

84
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:28,541
That's great, but Cardia should
probably stay here, right?

85
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:29,291
Huh?

86
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:30,833
Good point.

87
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:32,708
Since you're the one they're
after, we have to keep you safe.

88
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,166
It's best if you stay
at the mansion--

89
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,291
[VAN]
No. We should bring her.

90
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:39,625
It's like you said. Twilight
wants her more than anything.

91
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:40,875
If the worst comes to fruition,

92
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:43,416
at least we'll have
an ace in the hole.

93
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,333
I thought we'd come
to an understanding.

94
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:46,833
I've been crystal clear.

95
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:49,708
My only objective is
to take out Finis.

96
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:53,625
If you want my help, then
you will accept my terms.

97
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:54,750
Your terms?!

98
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:55,958
I don't know.

99
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:58,250
I dislike ultimatums.

100
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:02,041
But Van's strength is critical
to this mission's success.

101
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,458
I'd like to go.

102
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:07,833
If you're all putting yourselves
in danger like this,

103
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:10,083
then I should go, too.

104
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:13,375
Because we're a team.

105
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:15,458
But, Cardia, it's not safe.

106
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,916
[LUPIN] All right.
You've got yourself a deal.

107
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,750
[IMPEY] Lupin, slow down!
Think about what you're saying!

108
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:22,000
Just relax.

109
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:24,708
I will not let Twilight
get their hands on her.

110
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:27,416
She's going to have to learn
how to take care of herself.

111
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,958
Starting right now,
your training begins.

112
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:31,458
My training?

113
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:35,125
The people in this room have
a wide array of abilities.

114
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:37,625
We have England's
leading Alchemist.

115
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:41,583
A well-informed noble.
A battle-hardened hero.

116
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:44,208
A guy who's good with
machines, if nothing else.

117
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:45,416
Really?

118
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,791
And a gifted thief with
a 100% success rate!

119
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:51,041
Who better to teach you
how to defend yourself?

120
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:52,541
What do you say?

121
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:54,083
[FRAN]
You're right.

122
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:56,750
Whatever you need, Cardia,
we're here for you.

123
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:57,791
[SAINT chuckles]

124
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:00,041
This sounds
perfectly delightful.

125
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:01,166
[IMPEY]
Hmm...

126
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,291
But I'm still really worried.

127
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:05,500
Don't be! I'll work hard!

128
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:07,833
So please! I want you
to be my teacher, Impey!

129
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:08,875
[sputters]

130
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:11,000
Teacher?

131
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:13,791
Well, when you put it that way,
it has a nice ring to it!

132
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:15,791
Get ready, 'cause Teacher
Impey's gonna whip up

133
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:18,750
an invention the likes of which
you've never seen before!

134
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:19,916
[LUPIN] Whatever you're
going to give her

135
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,375
just make sure it's safe.

136
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:23,458
If it explodes,
there'll be hell to pay.

137
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:24,708
[FRAN chuckles]

138
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:26,375
In that case, maybe we
should teach Cardia

139
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:27,666
how to dress a wound first?

140
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,750
Hey, I'm not some
kinda imbecile!

141
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:31,875
I'm a genius engineer!
Have a little faith!

142
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:33,333
[SAINT]
Impey. Get down...

143
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:35,208
This is foolishness.

144
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:02,958
[LUPIN] You seem really,
I don't know, alive.

145
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:04,916
Like you're having lots of fun.

146
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,458
[CARDIA]
Is this fun? I didn't know.

147
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:08,583
I've learned quite a bit,

148
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:10,583
but there's just so
much to remember.

149
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:12,791
I happen to think
that's a good thing.

150
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:14,500
In my opinion,
keeping busy with work

151
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:17,333
is a great way to stay
healthy and strong.

152
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:19,750
But Fran seems like he's
working all the time.

153
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,625
To the point that his
face gets all pale.

154
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:22,750
[LUPIN chuckles]

155
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:25,125
That's called working too hard.

156
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:26,916
We're all set on the intel.

157
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,125
And the inventions we'll need

158
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:30,041
for the plan are

is progressing really well!

everything about martial arts.

asked me here today?

Sorry, but you're
wasting your time.

Oh, no. I have a
proposal for you.

This is the "Phantom
Thief under the moon"

171
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:00,625
who keeps going after
vampire family treasures.

is he'll be targeting

to your training,

capture this thief.

Better than jumping straight
to fighting Twilight, yes?

Plus, we're low on money. We can
definitely use the extra cash.

offer my assistance.

All right. Let's see.

Two years ago, the

Yes, he was.

He killed the Vampire King

I honestly have no idea
how the child survived.

The rest of his family's gone,

That's so sad.

316
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:21,416
[VAN]
It's time. I have to end this.

317
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:28,666
[door opens]

318
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,708
[DELACROIX] I've been
waiting for you. Helsing.

319
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:40,916
Take arms.

320
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,625
Here, in the same
spot my father died,

321
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:46,541
I will remove your head
from your shoulders!

322
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:53,625
[DELACROIX] My father's regret.
My mother's grief.

323
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:56,000
The anger of my compatriots.

324
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:58,875
I will avenge them all,
right here and now!

325
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:02,958
[yells]

326
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:06,166
Just like old times.

327
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:09,458
Why did you betray him?
He trusted you, Van!

328
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:12,166
Do you truly despise me,
Count Dracula?

329
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:13,708
Never call me that!

330
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:15,916
Ever since you
murdered my father,

331
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,291
I inherited his name!

332
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:21,041
I despise you with
all that I am!

333
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:30,000
Then fight me like you
mean it, Delacroix the 2nd.

334
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:34,416
[yells]

335
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:39,000
[IMPEY] Well, this place
has seen better days.

336
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:51,250
You said you'd take
revenge on all humanity.

337
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:52,833
Is this all you've got?

338
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:54,625
[growls] Shut up!

339
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:02,500
[CARDIA gasps]

340
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:04,458
You're far too weak.

341
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:07,750
You can't even defeat me.

342
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:10,666
[DELACROIX] Don't
underestimate me, Van Helsing!

343
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,708
I've lived my whole
life for this moment!

344
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:15,333
Humanity's about to
get what it deserves!

345
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:26,875
Lupin, please!

346
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:28,458
It'll be fine.

347
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:34,166
[VAN]
It's over now.

348
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:38,708
Give up on taking revenge
on human beings. You got it?

349
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:41,791
[DELACROIX]
You want me to give up?

350
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:43,000
How could I?

351
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:45,125
What do I do with this anger?

352
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:47,833
Where do I put
all of this hatred?

353
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:50,333
It was you humans!

354
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:53,125
You took my father away from me!

355
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:57,541
[VAN screams]

356
00:18:57,625 --> 00:19:01,708
[VAN]
I fulfilled my duty. And yet...

357
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,083
Damn you, Finis.

358
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:15,958
I will give you
my life, Delacroix.

359
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:17,458
Wait, what?

360
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:19,916
[VAN] There is something
I have to do first.

361
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,666
Because of that, I cannot
give you my life right now.

362
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:27,875
But when my task is
done, you can have it.

363
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,875
You have my word.

364
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:32,750
All of these people
here are my witnesses.

365
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:34,916
What sort of game
are you playing, Van?

366
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,791
I don't believe you!
And I will never forgive you!

367
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:41,875
[VAN]
You don't have to.

368
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:43,458
I'm the one you despise.

369
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:46,750
Humanity has
nothing to do with it.

370
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:48,250
You can have your revenge.

371
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:50,750
Just leave the
rest of them alone.

372
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:04,208
[DELACROIX crying]

373
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:16,541
[CARDIA]
He needs help.

374
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:19,541
Can we please take this boy
back to the mansion with us?

375
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:21,291
We can't leave him here.

376
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:24,000
If we do, he'll be
lonely and afraid.

377
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:25,916
I know that feeling.

378
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,083
There's not a soul
on this planet

379
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:33,208
that deserves to be alone.

380
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,166
[CARDIA] Would you like
to come live with us?

381
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:39,666
I just can't!

382
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:43,916
I am his grave keeper. I'm
not going to leave him alone.

383
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,541
[VAN]
Keep an eye on me.

384
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:46,625
[DELACROIX gasps]

385
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:49,291
When I finish,
you can take my life.

386
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:50,916
You can have your vengeance.

387
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,666
Then you can finally find
the peace you deserve.

388
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:54,875
[gasps]

389
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,666
[CARDIA] Do you think
he'll actually come?

390
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:05,958
You said you wanted to learn
martial arts, didn't you?

391
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:07,791
I'll teach you what I know.

392
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:09,041
Huh?

393
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:11,500
[VAN]
Be warned, I show no mercy.

394
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:14,333
Not even to women.

395
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:15,791
Fine by me.

396
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:18,333
That's very kind. Thanks.

397
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:23,708
[CARDIA]
The sad color I saw in his eyes

398
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:26,250
when we first met
hasn't disappeared.

399
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:28,333
But now I see
something different:

400
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:31,208
A kindness hiding
just underneath.

401
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:33,458
Someone else reached out to me.

402
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:36,041
Now I want to do
the same for him.

403
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:40,541
But how? I just wanna
help in any way I can.

404
00:23:18,875 --> 00:23:20,750
I'm really glad you're
training her, Van.

405
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:24,291
Just make sure you're not
too rough on the lady, okay?

406
00:23:24,375 --> 00:23:25,958
[rustling]

407
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
[DELACROIX]
Van Helsing, all those promises

408
00:23:29,083 --> 00:23:31,750
that you made to
me back there...

409
00:23:31,833 --> 00:23:33,541
...did you mean them?

410
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:38,500
Looks like we're having
a welcome party tonight.

411
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,416
You'd better join in, Van!

412
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:45,958
[VAN]
Sure.
