So beautiful. You look
exactly like my darling girl.

My perfect,
beloved little angel.

Cardia, my dear love.

You're my most precious.

Why, Father?

Why won't you love me, too?

Good, you're changed.

This outfit just
didn't suit you at all.

14
00:01:06,875 --> 00:01:11,125
[FINIS] So what do you think
of my ship? I find it amusing.

15
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:13,791
[CARDIA]
Amusing?

16
00:01:13,875 --> 00:01:17,250
You destroyed London
because you find it amusing?

17
00:01:17,333 --> 00:01:19,708
Didn't you think about
all of the innocent people

18
00:01:19,791 --> 00:01:21,500
who live in the city?

19

[FINIS]
What are you talking about?

20
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:29,250
It's not me but the Horologium
inside your chest

21
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:31,125
that will wreak
unimaginable devastation

22
00:01:31,208 --> 00:01:33,583
upon this world, Sister.

[CARDIA]
It's hot.

28
00:01:50,166 --> 00:01:53,250
At long last,
the awakening begins.

29
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:56,916
The awakening of
the Horologium.

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,541
Ah. Father.

31
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:02,416
[ISAAC]
Cardia.

32
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:08,416
My child. Hear me. The
moment is finally here.

33
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,875
The moment my greatest
wish comes true.

34
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:14,958
Father. It's you.

35
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:16,791
[ISAAC]
The world will change.

36
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:19,083
What "is" will no longer be.

37
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:21,875
You must guide the people
to a new paradigm.

38
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:27,916
Cardia, my dear,
everything begins with you.

[LEONHARDT]
What in the world is that thing?


40
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,708
This is beyond my
area of expertise.


41
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:25,041
Impey, any insight?

42
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:26,458
It's a killing machine.

43
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:28,416
We can try to put up a fight,

44
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,875
but <i>The Nautilus</i>
won't make it easy.

45
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:36,333
That ship is an impregnable
harbinger of death.

46
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:38,541
[FRAN]
Here's what we know for sure.

47
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:40,166
Based on the condition
of the victims,

48
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:44,291
it's clear what weapon <i>The</i>
<i>Nautilus</i> used: Zicterium.

49
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:45,458
[gasps]

50
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,875
Whenever Isaac took
over my research,

51
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:50,333
he probably stole some.

52
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:52,791
And took it with him
when he disappeared.

53
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:53,750
Makes sense.

54
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:54,958
From what I understand,

55
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:57,250
the so-called key to
initiating Code: Realize

56
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:58,833
was stolen, as well.

57
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:00,958
If that's true, it's
only a matter of time

58
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:03,333
before the enemy
breaks this silence.

59
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:05,791
Majesty. Tell us what to do.

60
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:09,375
I'm afraid we don't
have many options here.

61
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:11,458
Reinforce the army at once.

62
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:13,625
Recruit volunteers
until we have a force

63
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:15,875
capable of standing
up to <i>The Nautilus</i> .

64
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:17,083
Ma'am!

65
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:18,250
We don't have a clear picture

66
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:20,208
of what the other
side is capable of yet.

67
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:23,875
So, Captain, shoring up
our defenses is key.

68
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:26,000
The airship's armor
needs repairing.

69
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:28,000
How much time do you need?

70
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:31,666
It's hard to say precisely,
but a few days at least.

71
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,166
[FRAN]
That long?

72
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:02,333
What are you planning to do?

73
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:05,666
We've still got the Ornithopter
back at the mansion, don't we?

74
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:14,750
Don't be a damn fool.
That would be suicide.

75
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:17,666
Besides, you're in no
condition right now.

76
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:21,833
[LUPIN] I made a vow. I promised
I would steal her back.

77
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:26,333
Maybe I can't make the poison
go away, but so what?

78
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:28,916
As long as Cardia's safe
and back where she belongs,

79
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,208
then I can make her smile.

80
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:34,625
I can't touch her skin,
but at least she'll be alive!

81
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:35,875
Damn you!

82
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:38,375
Why didn't you kill him
like you said you would?

83
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:40,750
You had your chance
to take out Finis,

84
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:44,000
but you didn't pull the trigger!

85
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:48,250
The girl has a dream.
And I want it to come true.

86
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:53,583
The thing is, what Finis said
made my heart waver.

87
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:55,083
You're right.

88
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:56,750
Even if we don't
remove the poison,

89
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,333
she'll at least
get to live a life.

90
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:00,416
And with Finis gone,

91
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,041
she won't have to worry
about being used

92
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:04,583
for her father's
twisted fantasies.

93
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:08,208
No one will ever
come after her again.

94
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:11,458
But, Lupin, don't forget.

95
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:13,166
She told you her dream.

96
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:17,166
All she wants in this life
is to feel your skin on hers.

97
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:22,666
Cardia wants to be held.
Just like any normal girl.

98
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:26,291
Didn't you tell her you'd help
make that dream come true?

99
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:28,208
Will you quit now?

100
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:30,666
Will you give up on her dream?

101
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:35,000
You're right.
What am I thinking?

102
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:40,000
I didn't get to tell her, Van.

103
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:42,708
She doesn't know
how I really feel.

104
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:44,250
The truth is,

105
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:46,125
I'd give up everything
I have for her sake

106
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:48,583
and I wouldn't think
twice about it.

107
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:51,125
Even if it means
laying down my life.

108
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:54,875
I love her so much.

109
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:58,625
Then I have one job.

110
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:02,291
To make sure you have the
chance to tell her the truth.

111
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:08,750
We will save her life. Trust me.

112
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:16,333
Yes. You're damn right.

113
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:19,625
I'm not going to give up
until her dream comes true!

114
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,041
[IMPEY] How come I didn't get
an invitation to this party?

115
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:29,166
[LUPIN]
Impey? Fran?

116
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:32,125
I've a theory to share with you.

117
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:34,875
Do you remember what Finis
said back at St. Paul's?

118
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:38,250
He said if we destroy him,
Cardia is doomed.

119
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,333
Well, guess what.

120
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:44,500
If my theory is right, we can
save her and the world!

121
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:50,208
[footsteps]

122
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:54,750
Are the negotiations complete?
I certainly hope so.

123
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:57,041
[LUPIN]
You really think this will work?

124
00:08:57,125 --> 00:09:00,041
[FRAN] If my hypothesis
is correct, absolutely.

125
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:03,208
[VAN] Either way, we need to
get Cardia out of there first.

126
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:05,208
Any idea where she'll be?

127
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:06,625
[IMPEY]
Hm.

128
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:08,833
I can't say for sure, but
I do have a general idea.

129
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:12,875
[VAN] A general idea?
That's not very reassuring.

130
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:15,416
An educated guess'll
have to suffice.

131
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,000
We'll find her.

132
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:19,708
I'm more worried about how we're
going to get close to the ship.

133
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:20,708
Impey?

134
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:22,708
I can handle that part.

135
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:23,916
But look,

136
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,333
if they hit us with a
concentrated attack,

137
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:28,125
there's not much I can do.

138
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:30,750
[DELACROIX]
Wait!

139
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:32,708
You're going to
want to hear this!

140
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:34,750
It's about Saint!

141
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:38,833
[SAINT] We sortie first thing
tomorrow morning.

please launch a full-scale
attack on the enemy's ship.

00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,000
All right.

00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:48,125
But let me make
sure I understand.

146
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:50,541
You're suggesting these
dubious-looking characters

00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:52,500
are going to protect
us with their magic?

is one way to put it, yes.

will be a great help

He defied this organization.

161
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,041
How can Idea support anyone

162
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:29,041
who would behave
with such insolence?

163
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:30,541
[OMNIBUS]
I have one priority:

164
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:34,458
To stop Isaac's nefarious
plot by any means necessary.

165
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:37,875
As the leader of Idea,
I see no alternative.

166
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:41,833
I see. You're saying
we need them right now.

167
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:11,208
All right. Men,
make preparations.

168
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:17,916
[IMPEY]
All finished!

I'm sorry about
the wait, everyone.

Saint. It's almost time.

171
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,166
[SAINT]
Indeed.

172
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,250
Just promise me you'll
come back in one piece.

173
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:28,041
Van, you're taking a British
Army airship, right?

174
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:30,541
Yes. I'll watch your backside.

175
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:33,875
If they even try to take you
down, I'll make them pay.

176
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:36,875
[SAINT] Well done.
You've thought of everything.

177
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:39,333
Van, you sure you
can handle that job?

178
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:42,333
I'd hate for you to
get wounded again!

179
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:43,500
You care to test me?

I'm good, thanks!

Look.

00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:55,041
I have come to see you off.

184
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:57,333
I've also decided it's
best I assist the humans

00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:59,625
here on the ground.

00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:01,125
All right.

One more thing!

Do you hear me?

And don't come alone either!
Bring everyone back with you!

00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:20,875
Deal.

[HERLOCK]
Are you certain about this?

193
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:33,500
If we shoot down <i>Nautilus</i> ,

194
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:35,916
London will suffer
even more damage.

195
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
The recovery process
will not be a quick one.

196
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:41,458
[VICTORIA]
Then so be it.

197
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:43,833
The people of this
country are my children.

198
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:46,041
Buildings may crumble
and bridges may fall,

199
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:50,208
but I will do what is required
to keep my family safe.

200
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:53,833
I must. As their Queen,
I have no other choice.

201

[SOLDIER A]
Your Majesty!

[LUPIN]
Don't worry, Cardia. I'm coming.

205
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:41,458
[ISAAC] At long last.
The moment is finally here.

206
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:44,041
You must guide the
people to a new world.

207
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:49,500
Cardia, my dear.
It all begins with you.

My father.

00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:09,791
[FINIS]
What are you trying to do?

211
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:11,291
You're such a fool.

212
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:12,708
In spite of everything,

213
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:15,583
you still want to believe
that you're a human being.

214
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:18,416
But you're not, Sister.

215
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:22,416
You're nothing but
a doll. Just like me.

216
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:28,208
[FINIS]
Everything that is, or was,

217
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:31,750
our brilliant Father, Isaac
Beckford, is contained here,

218
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:33,583
within my main body.

219
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:36,166
The puzzle is all
but assembled, Sister.

220
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:40,083
All I have to do now is put
the final piece in place.

221
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:43,625
That's me, isn't it?

222
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:44,916
I will act as a vessel

223
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,375
for your Horologium's
unparalleled energy,

224
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:48,416
and from our union,

225
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,875
an all-powerful
god will be born.

226
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:54,625
Then the world as we understand
it will come to an end.

227
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:58,208

What happens to the two of us?

228
00:14:58,291 --> 00:15:00,125
[FINIS]
An excellent question.

229
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:02,958
My personality will
simply disappear.

230
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:06,416
As will the Horologium
inside your body.

You mean...

Yes. Your poison will
be eradicated at last.

234

How sad for you though.

Don't tell me you've forgotten.

The Horologium is also
your heart, dear Sister.

Whatever happens, you cannot
survive without the Horologium.

Your fate is to disappear
along with me.

what you want? To die?

Why not? I'm not afraid.

Don't you understand?
I was made to die.

242

If I fulfill my purpose, I'll
finally have father's praise.

There's no stopping it now.

Your poison will grow
stronger and stronger still.

This is why Father brought
you into the world.

So we could finish what
he started together!

00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:58,250
I'm never going to
leave your side again.

322
00:22:48,291 --> 00:22:51,875
Well, well. It's your
knight in shining armor.

323
00:22:51,958 --> 00:22:53,666
[BOTH gasp]

324
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:56,416
I will not let you
stand in Father's way!

[screams]

326
00:23:04,875 --> 00:23:06,041
Cardia!

327
00:23:17,333 --> 00:23:18,875
Lupin.

328
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:27,208
Say, goodbye, Lupin.

329
00:23:27,291 --> 00:23:28,958
Forever.

00:23:32,291 --> 00:23:33,458
