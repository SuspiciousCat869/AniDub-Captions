1
00:00:09,166 --> 00:00:12,875
[CARDIA] I want you to tell me
everything about Code: Realize.

2
00:00:12,958 --> 00:00:15,416
Code: Realize is the
gloriously perfect plan

3
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,375
our father concocted
many years ago.

4
00:00:18,458 --> 00:00:20,125
It's goal is simple.

5
00:00:20,208 --> 00:00:24,333
To reduce England and the rest
of the world to a pile of dust!

6
00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:26,541
[FINIS laughs]

7
00:00:26,625 --> 00:00:27,958
Aww, look at you!

8
00:00:28,041 --> 00:00:30,541
Covering your eyes and ears
won't change anything!

9
00:00:30,625 --> 00:00:32,916
After all, your very
existence destroys

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,500
every single thing in
its path, does it not?

11
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:38,083
[FINIS laughing]

12
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:40,458
[SAINT]
I am a disciple of Idea.

13
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:42,708
I have a destiny I must fulfill.

14
00:00:42,791 --> 00:00:44,250
Idea?

15
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:47,833
Cardia, my dear,
I'm here for one reason.

16
00:00:47,916 --> 00:00:50,291
I have come here to kill you.

17
00:00:50,375 --> 00:00:51,708
[gasps]

18
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:25,916
[SAINT] Since time immemorial,
there has existed in this world

19
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
a clandestine organization that
oversees all human history.

20
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:32,291
It's called Idea.

21
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:33,791
Throughout the course of time,

22
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:36,458
they use any means
necessary to remove errors

23
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:39,083
with the express purpose
of guiding mankind

24
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:42,333
toward the correct destiny.

25
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:44,583
The correct destiny?

26
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:47,875
[SAINT] Humans are weak.
As such, they make mistakes.

27
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:51,291
That's why Idea exists,
to set those mistakes right.

28
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:53,416
No matter the cost.

29
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,791
The reality is this:

30
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:56,791
They believe you're one
of those mistakes.

31
00:02:56,875 --> 00:03:00,375
They want to eliminate you.

32
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:02,875
The cursed "Children of Isaac."

33
00:03:02,958 --> 00:03:07,125
The keys to the activation
of Code: Realize.

34
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:09,958
The existence of you and your
siblings will disturb history

35
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:13,833
and invite disasters the likes
of which have not been seen.

36
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:16,625
I'm sorry, but this
can't be ignored.

37
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,125
So that's why you've
come here to kill me?

38
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:24,125
[SAINT]
Here.

39
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:28,250
Drink this. It will ensure
yours is a peaceful death.

40
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:36,416
Isaac's insidious plan must
be stopped at all costs.

41
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:43,750
[FINIS] You saw it on your way
here, didn't you, Sister?

42
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:48,083
The destroyed cityscape.
Bodies strewn about everywhere.

43
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:49,416
[FINIS chuckles]

44
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,500
[FINIS] Everyone is going
to die because of you.

45
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:54,625
Everyone! Even your friends!

46
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:02,916
Cardia, you mustn't.

47
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,875
[CARDIA]
I won't use it.

48
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:07,375
It just needs to look
like I took it from you.

49
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:09,458
It's all right.

50
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,000
I'll be okay.

51
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:13,958
Thank you for worrying
about me so much.

52
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:20,458
[VAN]
You two.

53
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:21,875
We're having a meeting.

54
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:23,583
On my way.

55
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:26,666
Saint.

56
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:30,708
[SAINT] I pray fortune
will be on your side.

57
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:33,750
Where's he off to?

58
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:35,166
Is everything all right?

59
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:38,458
Uh. Yes. We're fine.

60
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,083
Hi, Drac!

61
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,458
Well, there you are!

62
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:52,250
[SISI barks]

63
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,708
Hi, Sisi!

64
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:56,625
We're lucky. The army
escorted them here.

65
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:58,000
To be on the safe side,

66
00:04:58,083 --> 00:05:00,708
I brought a few things I
thought might come in handy.

67
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:01,750
[IMPEY chuckles]

68
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:02,958
Aww! Good boy!

69
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:05,000
Take your hands off
of me right now!

70
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:06,958
[IMPEY] Don't get mad!
It's a compliment, Drac!

71
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:07,958
[DELACROIX]
I don't need a compliment

72
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:09,541
from the likes of you!

73
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:14,000
Where is Lupin?

74
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:15,250
Uh.

75
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,208
He's being treated in the
medical tent over there.

76
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:22,166
He's fine. He just
needs a little rest.

77
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,791
But don't worry, he'll be
back on his feet in no time.

78
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:26,916
[DELACROIX]
Huh? He was hurt?

79
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,083
He sure was! He's laid up
in a hospital bed right now!

80
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:33,291
Guess that'll teach him to brag
about being nimble all the time.

81
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:36,333
On the other hand, Lupin's been
on the move a lot lately.

82
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:38,708
A little "R and R" might
do him some good!

83
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:40,541
You're so compassionate, Impey.

84
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:41,458
I know!

85
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:42,875
Not to brag myself,

86
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:45,375
but a lotta people say
compassion is my middle name!

87
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:47,833
What's your last name
then, "talks-a-lot"?

88
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:49,041
That's mean!

89
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:50,333
Why do you always have
to go outta your way

90
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:51,500
to hurt my feelings, Drac?

91
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:53,541
[DELACROIX]
The truth hurts, doesn't it?

92
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:56,250
Are the men gathered?

93
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:57,250
Yes.

94
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:59,166
We have 10,000
able-bodied troops

95
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,333
ready to go to war
for their Queen.

96
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:03,541
Many are wounded,
but morale is high.

97
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:05,625
I promise you this much,
Your Majesty,

98
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:08,916
the men have not lost their
pride as British soldiers.

99
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:11,458
The bravery of these men

100
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:13,583
instills me with
immeasurable pride.

101
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:14,791
There's no doubt:

102
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:18,291
With them by my side,
Twilight will fall.

103
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:20,750
Stand at the ready,
men, because at dawn,

104
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:23,041
we march on St Paul's Cathedral.

105
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:25,416
Make preparations at once.

106
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,791
[SOLDIERS]
Right!

107
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:39,541
[groaning]

108
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:41,708
[DELACROIX]
Hm?

109
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:43,416
What's wrong?

110
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:47,916
[barks]

111
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,708
[LUPIN chuckles]

112
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:51,333
[DELACROIX]
Glad you're awake.

113
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:55,041
[LUPIN]
Huh? Oh. Drac. You're here.

114
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:56,416
Yeah.

115
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,791
Cardia was with me too,
till just a few moments ago.

116
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:01,666
She left in a hurry.
I'm not sure why.

117
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,583
[VAN]
Cardia?

118
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:23,500
You wanna tell me what
happened with the Count?

119
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,291
[VAN sighs]

120
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:30,875
Well, I'm not going
to force your hand.

121
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:37,708
You know, you've changed
since I first met you.

122
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:40,791
It means a lot that you
and I have become friends.

123
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:43,125
You've taught me so
many different things.

124
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:45,083
I would be nowhere without you.

125
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:46,625
Don't thank me just yet.

126
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:49,291
Believe me, this whole
thing is far from over.

127
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:51,166
For both of us.

128
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,750
Uh?

129
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:56,541
The next time I cross
paths with Finis,

130
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:58,875
I won't let him get away.

131
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:01,541
I'll put an end to him.

132
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:03,041
But once the job is done,

133
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:07,166
I'm afraid there is
a debt I have to pay.

134
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,708
I made a promise and
I can't take it back.

135
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:13,625
After I have my revenge,
my life is Delacroix's.

136
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,333
[CARDIA]
But, Van...

137
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:23,041
You're my friend and
I don't want you to go.

138
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:29,500
I have to.

139
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:34,041
Outside of my desire to
bring justice to Finis,

140
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:36,916
there are no chains
binding me to this life.

141
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:49,333
[IMPEY humming]

142
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:50,750
[IMPEY]
It's rough around the edges,

143
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:52,833
but it'll make some
pretty fireworks!

144
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:54,041
Just wait.

145
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:54,541
[FRAN]
Whoa!

146
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:57,500
[yelping]

147
00:08:57,583 --> 00:09:00,625
Come on, take it easy, Fran.
You scared me half to death!

148
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:02,291
Huh? Oh. Sorry.

149
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,333
Look at this, Impey.

150
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:05,541
[IMPEY]
Hm?

151
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:07,666
This is that thing that
Cardia found, right?

152
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,666
What am I looking at, Fran?

153
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,250
There's a name here
that might ring a bell.

154
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:13,833
Do you remember Nemo?

155
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:16,708
Nemo? Nemo from
the airship race?

156
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:18,208
[FRAN]
Yes.

157
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:21,083
There's a page missing, so
I'm not sure about the details.

158
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:23,583
This much is clear.

159
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:26,791
It would appear Nemo was deeply
involved in Isaac's plan.

160
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:28,541
Are you kidding me?

161
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:30,208
I wish I was, Impey.

162
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:33,166
The name "Nautilus" is
written down here as well.

163
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:34,875
Though I'm not sure
what it means.

164
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:36,791
[IMPEY]
Nautlilus?

165
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:39,666
That sounds really
familiar to me.

166
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,541
Ah! Come on, Impey! Think!

167
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:45,958
Agh! If Saint were here,
he'd figure it out!

168
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:48,791
Yes, he would.

169
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:51,958
But he's not.
He'll come back, right?

170
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:53,166
Huh?

171
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:56,125
Well, Fran.
Lupin's hurt real bad.

172
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:57,625
We don't know where Saint is.

173
00:09:57,708 --> 00:10:00,166
And London's in dire straights.

174
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:03,000
I'd be a liar if I said I wasn't
more than a little discouraged

175
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:04,375
right about now.

176
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:06,875
But I'll do anything to keep
Cardia outta harm's way,

177
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:10,333
even if it means laying
my life on the line!

178
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:11,916
Same for me.

179
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,791
I'm afraid, but there's no way
I'm going to give up hope.

180
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:17,375
We just have to
keep our heads up.

181
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:19,625
As long as we stay positive
and stick together,

182
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:22,083
I have no doubt it
will all be fine.

183
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:23,708
Trust me.

184
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:26,583
When this is all over,
Cardia will be happy again.

185
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:27,791
Should I be worried?

186
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:29,291
'Cause it sounds like
a new rival in love

187
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:30,458
is jumping in the ring.

[FRAN chuckles]

189
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:32,833
Well, maybe so.

190
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:34,583
[BOTH laugh]

191
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:43,583
You're a member of
our organization.

192
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:45,541
She's nothing more than
a mistake of history

193
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:47,708
that must be
properly dealt with.

194
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:49,875
Forget about her.

195
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:56,708
And if I can't?
What happens then?

196
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:59,000
[GUINEVERE]
As a fellow member of Idea,

197
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:01,458
I will have to open your eyes.

198
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:11,000
[SAINT]
Farewell.

199
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:45,958
[SOLDIER G]
Thanks.

200
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,250
Would you like some bread?

201
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:01,083
Yes, please.
Thank you very much.

202
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:03,333
So, um, are you in pain?

203
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:04,708
I was.

204
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:07,000
But thankfully, the medicine
is starting to kick in.

205
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:09,833
My body feels a
bit heavy, is all.

206
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:13,708
Oh.

207
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:15,583
This is my treasure.

208
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:19,708
What a cute child.

209
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:21,500
I miss them both.

210
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:25,916
I can't wait to get back home.
So I can hold them in my arms.

211
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,541
[SOLDIER J chuckles]

[sighs]

214
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:40,125
I'm glad to see you're awake.

215
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:42,500
If you're well enough to give
your rations to a dog,

216
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:44,416
then get up and work.

217
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,125
You're a real sweetheart.

218
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:48,791
You know, when I look
at you I think, "Sympathy."

219
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:50,458
No one else comes
to see me in here,

220
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:52,583
so I have to settle for him.

221
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:54,125
Right? Good boy!

222
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:58,250
You fool. Everyone's working
extra hard to cover for you.

223
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:01,208
Stop wasting time. Get ready.

224
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:02,458
[LUPIN]
Hmph.

225
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:07,125
[LUPIN]
What's Cardia doing?

226
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:08,625
Truth is,

227
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:11,916
I'm worried she's anguishing
over that bile Finis spewed.

228
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,666
I just hope she's not off crying
somewhere all by herself.

229
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,416
It's driving me mad.

230
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,833
I wish I could help her somehow.

231
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:21,666
But look at me.

232
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:25,375
You're in love with her, right?

233
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:27,166
In love? No!

234
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,750
I thought you would be a
much better liar than that.

235
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:32,250
[LUPIN] I'm not lying,
Van! I promise you!

236
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:36,541
If that's really true, then
what are you so worked up about?

237
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:40,083
There's no guarantee you'll
both still be alive tomorrow.

238
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:43,875
Trust me, regret
is a foolish thing.

239
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:46,750
From a man who has
nothing left in this world,

240
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:48,416
tell her what you're feeling.

241
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:52,833
Your words might be the chain
that binds her to this life.

242
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:56,500
If you don't, she
could end up like me.

243
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:57,791
Van.

244
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:02,666
[LUPIN laughs]

245
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,166
You are the last
person I thought

246
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,916
would give me advice like that.

247
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,166
What gives, did
hell freeze over?

248
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:11,791
Sadly, our game of friendship
is about to come to an end.

249
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:14,708
Consider it a parting
gift of sorts.

[LUPIN]
Cardia.

254
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:30,250
[LUPIN]
Are you crying?

255
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:34,375
I'm scared.

256
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:37,125
I just realized that I'm scared.

257
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:38,791
Scared of dying,

258
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:41,916
and because I've never
known this feeling.

259
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:46,583
I'm so afraid.

260
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:48,083
I understand.

261
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:52,541
But I promise you, we will
always be by your side, Cardia.

262
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:57,375
No matter what happens,
I swear, we will protect you.

Trust me. There's
nothing to be afraid of.

[CARDIA] I don't know how
you stay strong like this.

265
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:09,083
Aren't you scared?

266
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:10,916
Yes. Of course.

267
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,166
Don't you get it?

268
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:15,208
I never wanted you to
get hurt for my sake!

269
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:18,500
I was happy you were willing
to shield me from harm,

270
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:20,083
and yet...

271
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:23,541
I can't stand the thought of you
hurting yourself to protect me.

272
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:25,416
If you died,

273
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,500
I don't think I'd be able
to forgive myself for it.

274
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:31,000
Not now. And not ever.

275
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:33,916
I don't want you to put yourself
at risk on my account,

276
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,291
not anymore.

277
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:36,541
Don't you see?

278
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:38,875
I don't want you to die for me.

279
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:41,375
You understand?

[LUPIN]
Cardia.

281
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:54,500
[CARDIA]
Lupin. It's strange...

282
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:58,208
But when I look at you,
my chest hurts.

283
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:01,958
It's more than I can bear.

284
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:06,625
Truly. It hurts me. But at
the same time, it feels good.

285

Sorry.

286
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:25,041
I'm not going to die, Cardia.

00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:26,958
I'm going to live a long time.

288
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:29,958
And I will protect you
every step of the way.

Look at that.

It appears Princess Cardia's
Prince is a Gentleman Thief.

Well, of course she likes him.
I am his partner after all.

Right. Look how
happy she looks.

We have to stay alive.

295

[IMPEY]
Huh?

296
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:53,875
I would gladly put my life
on the line for her sake.

297
00:17:53,958 --> 00:18:00,250
But still... I think she'd
prefer it if we survived.

298
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:01,208
[chuckles]

299
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:02,625
Right!

300
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:18,125
I'll ask one more time.

301
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:21,541
If we do this, we're all
risking our lives.

302
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:23,708
Are you guys with me or not?

303
00:18:24,791 --> 00:18:28,708
Finis is still alive,
isn't he? Count me in.

304
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:31,125
I will not stop until
he's destroyed.

305
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:32,791
I'm not walking away from this.

306
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:34,625
We've come way too far.

307
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:36,875
I am the best engineer
who's ever lived.

308

Not to mention a
soldier for true love!

Oh!

00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:42,458
Uh, sorry.

311
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:45,166
I think what I was
trying to say is this:

312
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,500
For you I'd do anything,

313
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:49,666
even charge head first
into the throws of battle!

like to join as well, my lady.

You're late to the party!
Where have you been?

319
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:15,458
We've all been worried sick!

00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,458
I'm going, too!

322
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:22,791
Are you sure?

323
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:24,500
[DELACROIX]
Well, generally speaking,

324
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:27,250
battles between humans
are none of my concern.

325
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,708
But, Helsing!

326
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:30,416
Don't try to fool
yourself into thinking

327
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,250
I've forgiven your debt!

328
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:35,833
That said, I like
Cardia quite a bit.

329
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:37,958
Besides, we've
already established

330
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:40,583
that when this is over,
your life belongs to me!

331
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:43,250
I think it's best to
keep a watchful eye.

332
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:46,875
And so... I'll fight with you!

333
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:49,583
You're becoming very brave.

334
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:51,791
[DELACROIX]
Don't you make fun of me!

335
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:55,458
Thank you, Drac.

336
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:57,083
[DELACROIX]
Uh.

337
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:58,500
Uh-huh.

338
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:02,958
Princess. Is there anything
you'd like to say?

339
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:07,083
Thank you all.

340
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:08,458
I've only made it this far

341
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:11,416
because I had all
of you by my side.

342
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,875
I am in your debt.

343
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:17,666
But our work's not done.
Help me cross the finish line.

344
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,291
[VICTORIA] Gentlemen, mighty
soldiers of the British Army,

345
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:27,208
today we march bravely towards

346
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:30,166
the enemy's stronghold
at St. Paul's Cathedral.

347
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,958
A diversion force will
launch a frontal assault.

348
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:37,041
At the same time, another force
will infiltrate from the rear.

349
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:40,583
Thus we will divide their troops
and weaken their defenses.

350
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:45,416
[VICTORIA] Men, I know you all
have your reasons for fighting.

351
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:50,833
For this country. For your
families. Or for yourselves.

352
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,375
That said, I beg this
of each and every man

353
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:55,833
who stands ready for combat.

354
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:58,166
Today, right here and now,

355
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:02,375
act as the sword of justice
for Alexandrina Victoria!

356
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:05,291
Together let us reclaim
the pride of this nation!

357
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:10,333
[SOLDIERS cheering]

358
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:16,500
[CARDIA]
It's starting.

359
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:18,500
I don't know what will happen.

360
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:22,875
I don't know what awaits us
at the end of the battle.

361
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:25,625
But I know this:
My friends are here.

362
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:31,041
And I wanna fight for them.
Because I'm not alone.

363
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:34,791
From now on, no more running.

364
00:23:09,458 --> 00:23:11,333
Charge!

365
00:23:11,416 --> 00:23:13,458
[SOLDIERS yelling]

366
00:23:13,541 --> 00:23:15,000
The battle's begun.

367
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:16,541
We should all say
a little prayer

368
00:23:16,625 --> 00:23:19,625
Finis doesn't find a way to
outsmart us this time around.

369
00:23:19,708 --> 00:23:21,291
Tell me, Lupin.

370
00:23:21,375 --> 00:23:25,458
The Queen's advisor,
is he not a friend of yours?

371
00:23:27,125 --> 00:23:29,000
Now's not the time for that.

372
00:23:29,083 --> 00:23:32,791
The battle's already underway.
Let's get to work.

373
00:23:32,875 --> 00:23:34,000
[LUPIN]
Right!

374
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:42,666
[chuckling]

375
00:23:43,708 --> 00:23:46,500
I'm waiting for you, Sister.
