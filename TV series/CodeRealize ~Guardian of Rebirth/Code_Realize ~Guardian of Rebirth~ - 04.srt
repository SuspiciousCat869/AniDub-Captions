1
00:00:09,458 --> 00:00:11,791
[BOTH] You want to capture
the train that Finis is riding?

2
00:00:11,875 --> 00:00:13,208
[LUPIN]
That's right.

3
00:00:13,291 --> 00:00:16,000
He's boarding a train to
London in two weeks time.

4
00:00:16,083 --> 00:00:17,541
It's perfect.

5
00:00:17,625 --> 00:00:20,125
He's going to be inspecting a
war plant on the north side.

6
00:00:20,208 --> 00:00:21,458
This plan will work.

7
00:00:21,541 --> 00:00:22,666
Finis will be all ours

8
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,291
and Twilight won't even
know what hit them.

9
00:00:28,458 --> 00:00:31,791
[VICTORIA]
Thank you again for coming.

10
00:00:31,875 --> 00:00:33,833
When one of my subjects
does me a favor,

11
00:00:33,916 --> 00:00:35,875
I am not likely to forget it.

12
00:00:35,958 --> 00:00:38,166
Herlock Sholmes.

13
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,166
I live to serve Her
Majesty the Queen.

14
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,041
You are not only
clever, Mr. Sholmes,

15
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:45,250
but highly skilled as well.

16
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:49,583
If I may, I find it criminal
you have not yet been knighted.

17
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:52,500
I am unworthy of such
an honor, Your Grace.

18
00:00:52,583 --> 00:00:54,375
[VICTORIA]
How very shrewd.

19
00:00:54,458 --> 00:00:56,750
You should know, I've chosen
you for this mission

20
00:00:56,833 --> 00:01:00,000
precisely because you have
no royal ties to speak of.

21
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:02,291
I would like you to accompany
a friend of the crown

22
00:01:02,375 --> 00:01:05,083
on an inspection as
his private escort.

23
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:07,291
[HERLOCK]
Not just any friend.

24
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:09,875
He's the leader of the British
intelligence organization,

25
00:01:09,958 --> 00:01:10,666
Twilight.

26
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:12,958
The man they call Finis.

27
00:01:15,291 --> 00:01:16,583
[HERLOCK]
According to my sources,

28
00:01:16,666 --> 00:01:18,041
his inspection of the war plant

29
00:01:18,125 --> 00:01:20,291
was hastily decided
a few days ago.

30
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:21,500
Given that you chose me,

31
00:01:21,583 --> 00:01:24,250
a man of "no royal ties,"
as you said,

32
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:26,833
I gather the escort task
is merely a cover,

33
00:01:26,916 --> 00:01:28,625
and that you wish me
to observe him.

34
00:01:28,708 --> 00:01:30,666
Quite clever, indeed.

35
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:34,041
[HERLOCK] I will gladly accept
your request, My Queen.

36
00:01:34,125 --> 00:01:35,375
As it happens,

37
00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:38,666
there is something in it
that concerns me as well.

38
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:41,666
Do you mean something
related to my request?

39
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:44,583
[HERLOCK] As you know, all
things in this life are related.

40
00:01:44,666 --> 00:01:46,708
Queries and misgivings,
at any two points,

41
00:01:46,791 --> 00:01:50,250
always form a straight
line, Your Majesty.

42
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:52,625
Call it a detective's hunch.

43
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:48,500
[knocking]

44
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,166
Forgive me. May I come in?

45
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,500
Of course.

46
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:57,500
You're up early.

47
00:03:57,583 --> 00:03:59,041
I couldn't sleep.

48
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:00,708
Why, are you nervous?

49
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:01,250
[CARDIA]
Mh-hm.

50
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:02,583
[LUPIN chuckles]

51
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:04,458
It's all right. I am too.

52
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:06,666
Today's the day we
execute our plan.

53
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,958
It's good to be
nervous, I think.

54
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,291
To tell you the truth,

55
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:13,875
I'm as anxious as the day
I did my first mission.

56
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:15,125
You'll do great.

57
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:17,500
In fact, I think you're
an excellent student.

58
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:20,000
But I suppose there are
more inspiring things

59
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:22,333
than learning from a mere thief.

60
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:25,750
But you've taught me so
many valuable things, Lupin.

61
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:28,291
And not just the techniques.

62
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:29,541
They're great, too.

63
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:32,291
But you showed me life
doesn't have to be sad.

64
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:36,166
That everyone deserves
companionship, no matter what.

65
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:54,416
[SISI barks]

66
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,750
[BOTH gasp]

67
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:57,458
[CARDIA]
Sisi!

68
00:04:57,541 --> 00:05:00,583
Oh, dear. I wonder if he
wants something to eat.

69
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:03,791
[LUPIN chuckles]

70
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:05,458
[CARDIA]
I'll feed him.

71
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:07,958
You stay here and
relax for a bit.

72
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:17,500
[VAN]
That girl.

73
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,625
You're falling for her, yes?

74
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:21,875
[LUPIN]
No! Of course not!

75
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:26,666
[IMPEY]
Come on!

76
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,708
You just can't sit around the
mansion sulking all day, Drac!

77
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:31,833
[DELACROIX]
Don't call me "Drac," you clod!

78
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:34,250
I don't understand why
I have to stay behind.

79
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:36,750
That noble there
is going, is he not?

80
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:38,375
Yes, of course,
but I'm an adult.

81
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:39,833
[DELACROIX growls]

82
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:41,166
[DELACROIX screams]

83
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,416
Will you stop treating me
like a petulant child?1

84
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,375
[growls]

85
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:45,666
[CARDIA]
Drac,

86
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,333
will you please look
after Sisi for me?

87
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:49,708
[DELACROIX grunts]

88
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:53,541
Well if you insist,
I guess I don't have a choice.

89
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:55,375
[BOTH chuckle]

90
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:58,541
Oh, Cardia, you're like
an angel sent from Heaven.

91
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,416
Indeed.

92
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,958
Now, shall we go over the
program for the big show?

93
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:08,416
Finis' train leaves
today. High noon.

94
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,583
That's when we'll make our move.

95
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:13,541
Our target is this saloon car.

96
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:17,291
First, Van and Fran will seize
control of the engine room.

97
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:20,333
[FRAN] I'll drive the train
the rest of the way.

98
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:22,833
[LUPIN] Van will neutralize
Finis' escorts on his way

99
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:25,000
to take over the saloon car.

100
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:27,583
Meanwhile, Cardia and I
will infiltrate the end car

101
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:29,000
and stand by.

102
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:31,125
Then we wait, patiently,

103
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:33,666
till we have a chance to
lure the escorts away.

104
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,083
You understand?

105
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:37,333
That sounds like a plan!

106
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:38,916
[LUPIN] First, we'll make
our way through the cars

107
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,083
with fewer guards and capture
the rear end of the saloon car.

108
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:44,708
After it's secure,
we'll uncouple it.

109
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:46,083
[SAINT]
Once we've isolated Finis,

110
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:48,291
we'll redirect the train
off of its original route

111
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:50,291
and onto this
diverging branch line.

112
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:52,958
This will be the last stop.

113
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:55,208
[LUPIN] The surrounding
area is a deep ravine.

114
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:58,208
It'll be incredibly difficult
for him to escape.

115
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:00,708
[SAINT] I'll use my
automobile to get there

116
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:02,333
before the train arrives.

117
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:05,416
All we have to do is grab
Finis and drive away.

118
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:10,916
It's a risky plan.
But it can work.

119
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Oh, Cardia, I forgot.

120
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:16,166
I have something I think
you're gonna like.

121
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,375
Here.

122
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:25,916
[gasps]

123
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,500
[CARDIA]
A pillow!

124
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:30,333
[FRAN] It was designed so
the poison won't get through.

125
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:32,500
I finally finished it.

126
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:36,583
Well, I'm glad to see
you've made her day, Fran.

127
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:38,500
But is this really
the time for gifts?

128
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:39,916
[FRAN]
Sure, why not?

129
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,208
In fact, I have another
present for you.

130
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,833
[IMPEY chuckles]

131
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:49,166
So adorable!

132
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,041
It looks good on you, Cardia.

133
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:53,041
A beautiful sight
to behold, indeed.

134
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:56,083
I suppose it's all right.
Much easier to move around.

135
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:58,750
Could be an advantage if you
find yourself in a fight.

136
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:00,000
Is that all you think about?

137
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:03,041
No lady's ever
going to want him.

138
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:04,541
Foolishness.

139
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:06,458
[CARDIA]
I love it.

140
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:09,708
I can't thank you
enough for this, Fran.

141
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:11,083
[FRAN, SAINT chuckle]

142
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:12,500
Here we go, team.

143
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:15,125
It's time to take your places.

144
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:17,375
The show's about to begin!

145
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:26,208
[FRAN] Well, this is where
we go our separate ways.

146
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:29,083
The two of you have the
most dangerous job by far.

147
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:30,416
Go lightly.

148
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,750
Yes. Do be careful. Both of you.

149
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:35,083
We'll be all right.

150
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:37,333
You just focus on remembering
what I taught you.

151
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:40,875
"Don't try to do anything
that's beyond my capabilities."

152
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,541
What else?

153
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:44,166
"If I find myself
in a fist-fight,

154
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,875
always go for the body blow."

155
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:48,583
[VAN]
That's right.

156
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:51,041
Well, best of luck
to you, gentlemen.

157
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:31,791
[CONDUCTOR A]
Oh?

158
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:36,416
You're so violent.

159
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:40,083
You won't catch me sneaking
around like a common theif.

160
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,625
Hey, there you are, Saint!

161
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:48,041
[SAINT]
Impey. How goes it?

162
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:49,791
This cute little lady
is locked, loaded,

163
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:51,375
and ready to take flight.

164
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:53,083
Right now, the only
thing she's waiting for

165
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:54,458
is her time to shine.

166
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:56,500
[SAINT]
I'm glad to hear it.

167
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:58,958
The train should be
on its way by now.

168
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:01,125
I'm going to head to
the rendezvous point.

169
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:03,250
You should probably
get a move on too.

170
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:05,458
Well, good luck, Saint.

171
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:12,250
[SAINT]
The wind.

172
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:26,541
[LUPIN]
Ready? Time to make an entrance.

173
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:28,083
Here we go.

174
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:47,416
[SOLDIERS gasp, cough]

175
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,250
[ALL gasp]

176
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:49,833
The rear car! Move it now!

177
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:51,041
[SOLDIERS]
Sir!

178
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:58,291
[LUPIN coughing]

179
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:01,833
Jeez. Impey. He always
takes it too far. Ugh.

180
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:03,541
Do you think our
plan will work?

181
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:06,625
Yes, 'course I do.
Come on, let's move.

182
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:12,375
[bang]

183
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:18,250
[SOLDIER C yells]

184
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:21,958
Ready yourselves, men. Fire!

185
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,166
[VAN] They were ready for us.
Could that mean...?

186
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:37,541
[LUPIN] Well, looks like
everything is going as planned.

187
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:38,750
[CARDIA]
Thank goodness.

188
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:41,250
[LUPIN] Come on.
We've still got work to do.

189
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:45,625
[LUPIN] This will destroy
the train car's coupler.

190
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:49,500
Cardia, I'm leaving this
with you, all right?

191
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:52,000
I'll do my best to keep
the soldiers off of you.

192
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:54,458
But I'm going to need you
to attach the device.

193
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:56,833
You trust me? Really?

194
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,375
[LUPIN]
Couplers aren't easy to detach

195
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:00,250
while the train is moving.

196
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:03,000
Even this might not be
enough to get it done.

197
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:06,708
And if it doesn't succeed,
that's where you come in.

198
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:09,583
You'll be able to melt the
coupler with your poison.

199
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:11,458
You can do this.

200
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,916
[rattling]

201
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:21,875
[LUPIN] We have to take
care of this, and fast!

202
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:24,666
Otherwise, Impey won't
be able to do anything.

203
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:25,791
[gasps]

204
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:29,000
[HERLOCK]
I thought we might meet.

205
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:31,125
Do you believe in fate, sir?

206
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,541
It appears our destinies were
bound to come together

207
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:35,625
on this train.

208
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:39,583
Mr. Gentleman Thief.
Arsène Lupin.

209
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:53,875
Lupin. Do you know him?

210
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:55,708
No. Can't say that I do.

211
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:58,291
But he doesn't look much
like a British soldier to me.

212
00:12:58,375 --> 00:12:59,541
[HERLOCK chuckles]

213
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:01,750
Quite a deduction for
a professional thief.

214
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:04,083
My name is Detective
Herlock Sholmes.

215
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:05,583
Detective?

216
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:10,208
That's right. I am your
mortal enemy, Arsène Lupin.

217
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:14,750
After an impressive stint of
thieving theatrics in London,

218
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,791
you decided to lie
low for a while,

219
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:19,791
but that was merely the
calm before the storm.

220
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:22,416
I suspected that something
might happen soon.

221
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,625
But you've really outdone
yourself this time,

222
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:26,458
Gentleman Thief.

223
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:29,375
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I
don't have time for small talk.

224
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:32,583
We've a prior engagement.
Kindly step aside, please.

225
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:35,125
[HERLOCK]
I can't do that.

226
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:37,208
After all, it is the
job of the detective

227
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:39,500
to apprehend the
thief, is it not?

228
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:41,708
Did you not hear me, friend?

229
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:44,125
I told you I don't have
time to play silly games

230
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:45,625
with the likes of you!

231
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:50,333
[LUPIN]
Sleeping gas. Enjoy your nap.

232
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:52,000
Cardia, come on.

233
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,125
[CARDIA]
Lupin!

234
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,041
[HERLOCK]
Don't underestimate me, friend.

235
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:02,000
An attack like that
is only effective

236
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:05,083
if your opponent
doesn't see it coming.

237
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:06,291
[gasps]

238
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:08,125
Look! We're here!

239
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:12,416
Cardia! Go on, I'll handle him.

240
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,625
You take care of the rest!

241
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:14,625
[gasps]

242
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:15,333
Lupin!

243
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:17,666
Go! I'm counting on you!

244
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,250
[gasps]

245
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:36,916
Take this!

246
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:44,416
[HERLOCK] That's a cute
little apprentice you have.

247
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,250
That said, I do not approve
of sending a lady off

248
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:48,666
all by herself.

249
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,833
This train is
dangerous, after all.

250
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:51,916
[LUPIN]
Heh.

251
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,291
If I were you, Mr. Sholmes,

252
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:56,000
I wouldn't underestimate
the girl either.

253
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:00,958
[OPERATIVE B]
Damn you!

254
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:02,208
[gunshot]

255
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:05,416
[CARDIA]
Van!

256
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,625
That was a nice body blow.

257
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:12,083
I'll take care of them.

258
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:22,041
[CARDIA]
That's it!

259
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:26,500
[explosion]

260
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:28,875
That's my girl. Well done!

261
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:33,541
[IMPEY]
Ah! There it is!

262
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:42,958
[IMPEY chuckles]

263
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:47,416
It appears my work
here is done, Sholmes.

264
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:51,625
What shall we do? Part ways
or finish what we started?

265
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:54,666
There's no time
like the present.

266
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,416
Next time.

267
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:58,416
[gasps]

268
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:04,416
[chuckles]

269
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,666
[LUPIN]
Sorry, my friend,

270
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,041
but I'm afraid I have
more important things

271
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:08,500
to deal with right now!

272
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:10,166
An ornithopter.

273
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,958
I never would've guessed
he'd make an exit like that.

274
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:15,083
If it's a detective's
job to catch a thief,

275
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:17,708
then it's the thief's job
to make a dramatic escape!

276
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:19,416
I hope you savor
that frustration

277
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,250
until we chance to meet again,
Detective Sholmes!

278
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:25,083
[chuckles]

279
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:26,250
Well played.

280
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:27,833
I already wanted to catch you,

281
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:31,333
but now I must say that you've
completely captured my interest.

282
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:34,291
[HERLOCK]
Watch yourself, Lupin.

283
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:35,791
I'm coming for you.

284
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:38,750
I won't stop. Ever.

285
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:41,166
Impey. Is it meant
to shake like this?

286
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,458
No! Not really!

287
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:44,791
I can't help it!
It's built for one man!

288
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:48,083
[SAINT]
Impey! Impey! Can you hear me?

289
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:49,791
[IMPEY]
Loud and clear, Saint.

290
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:52,541
Listen carefully.

291
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:54,208
You must not come here.

292
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:56,291
The operation has failed.

293
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:03,083
[CARDIA]
There's no one here?

294
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,250
Cardia!

295
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:08,041
[FINIS]
Proceed with caution, Aleister.

296
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:11,458
Remember, that gun will melt
if it happens to touch her skin.

297
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:12,875
[VAN]
Finis.

298
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:14,250
Greetings, Van.

299
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:17,375
It's been a long time,
hasn't it, my friend?

300
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:20,541
From the look on your face,
I'd say you want to kill me.

301
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:22,833
Oh, but you can't.

302
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:24,541
After all, you wouldn't
want to go against

303
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:26,083
your group's plan, would you?

304
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:28,166
[gasps]

305
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:30,875
[gasps]

306
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:33,791
Damn. It's over.

307
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:40,708
[IMPEY]
What the hell is happening?

308
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:44,875
If they keep going, they're
all gonna to wind up dead!

309
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:52,666
[LUPIN]
A British Army airship? Oh, no.

310
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:55,416
Cardia.

311
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:58,041
[FINIS laughing]

312
00:17:58,125 --> 00:17:59,041
Yes.

313
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:00,250
I was the one who
leaked the info

314
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:02,041
that I'd be on this
train hoping you dolts

315
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:04,333
would be foolish enough to
walk right into my trap!

316
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,666
And guess what?

317
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,208
It worked far better than
I ever thought it would!

318
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:09,875
Isn't this fun?

319
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:11,958
[laughing]

320
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:14,541
Tell me why. I don't get it.

321
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:16,541
[FINIS]
Isn't it perfectly obvious?

322
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:20,625
Because I wanted to finally
meet you, of course.

323
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:22,375
I've dreamed of this day.

324
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:24,166
Sister.

325
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,916
Wait. What?

326
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,166
That's right.

327
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,208
It is the fact that we
share a common father

328
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:32,833
that binds us together.

329
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:34,833
We are endowed with
the great responsibility

330
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:36,916
of carrying his legacy forward.

331
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,166
Does that mean your father's...?

332
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:43,291
[FINIS]
Mr. Isaac Beckford.

333
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:46,125
You poor thing.
You're so confused.

334
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:50,000
I suppose that's only natural.
You don't know anything.

335
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:51,625
You don't know why
you have no memories

336
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:53,250
from before you awakened.

337
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,916
Or why you have poison
flowing through your body.

338
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,875
Or even why that
mysterious device

339
00:18:57,958 --> 00:19:01,291
is imbedded deep
inside your chest.

340
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:04,458
And Father? You know
nothing of him either.

341
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:06,666
I'll tell you
everything in time.

342
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,791
Why not just tell me now?

343
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:12,041
[FINIS]
Come, Sister. Please.

344
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:13,916
And I'll tell you what I know.

345
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,083
[click]

346
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:18,000
I won't let you take her.

347
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:20,666
[FINIS laughs]

348
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:23,625
[FINIS] The Van I knew long
ago would've shot me by now.

349
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:25,583
The fact that I'm still
standing here unharmed

350
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:28,000
leads me to believe
that you've changed.

351
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:31,333
And, I'm sorry to say,
it is not for the better.

352
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:34,833
Van.

353
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:38,416
[FINIS] Aleister. Bring my
sister to me, please.

354
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:44,291
[CARDIA]
Van!

355
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:50,958
Cardia! Jump!

356
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:55,208
Do it now!

357
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:56,375
[growls]

358
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:58,916
Aleister! Stop her!

359
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:01,958
Go!

360
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:08,416
[IMPEY]
Uh, Lupin! Hurry it up!

361
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,458
[LUPIN]
Come on! Trust me!

362
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:13,375
I won't let you fall!

363
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:17,208
Sister!

364
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:29,416
Next time, I will shoot you.

365
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:49,666
[IMPEY yelling]

366
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,291
[IMPEY]
Hang on!

367
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,541
We're in serious trouble here!

368
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:05,208
[BOTH chuckle]

369
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:08,041
[LUPIN] Looks like they
managed to escape, too.

370
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:11,666
[SOLDIER I] Visibility is poor,
sir! We can't pursue them!

371
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:15,708
We'll meet again
one day soon. Sister.

372
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:23,291
[sighs]

373
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:31,375
We walked right
into Finis' trap.

374
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:38,750
[CARDIA] It's so strange.
What is this throbbing ache?

375
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:42,708
The chill I felt in the brief
touch of our fingers.

376
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:45,083
So familiar.

377
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:48,708
Did you feel it, too? Finis.

378
00:23:22,208 --> 00:23:25,833
Well, what a bizarre
turn of events.

379
00:23:25,916 --> 00:23:27,666
This is nothing at
all like the report

380
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:30,458
I delivered to her Majesty.

381
00:23:30,541 --> 00:23:32,458
Until we cross paths again,

382
00:23:32,541 --> 00:23:36,541
I wish you all the
best, Arsène Lupin.
