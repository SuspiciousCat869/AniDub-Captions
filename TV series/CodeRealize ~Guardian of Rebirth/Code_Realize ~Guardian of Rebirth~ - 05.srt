permission to use Zicterium.

[FRAN]
Hurry, Fran! Hurry!

00:00:36,208 --> 00:00:39,083
I wish it was nothing
more than a dream.

5
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,416
[LEONHARDT] Last week's train
explosion is being reported

6
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,416
as a terrorist attack carried
out by Victor Frankenstein

7
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,708
and his shadowy team
of conspirators.

8
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:23,250
That must be Finis' doing.

9
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:29,458
Well, it's no matter.

10
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:31,666
What's clear is that
Finis desperately wants

11
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,416
to get his hands
on that monster.

12
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,458
If I recall, you told me
you saw her, did you not?

13
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:38,833

14
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:40,166
[LEONHARDT]
Yes.

15
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,250
[VICTORIA]
My interest is piqued.

16
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:47,250
If we manage to get to
the monster before Finis,

17
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:51,291
I wonder, how do you
think he'll react then?

18
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:55,083
Looks like we just made
the most wanted list.

19
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:56,666
Any bright ideas?

20
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,375
[VAN] If we leave London,
they'll likely let us be.

21
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:01,166
But we can't achieve
our goal that way.

22
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,791
That's true.

23
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:06,666
Great. The town's all hyped up
for the knighting ceremony!

24
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:10,166
We can't even enjoy
the festivities.

25
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,708
Don't make that face.

26
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:15,250
Look, Saint's already
making moves.

27
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:17,375
He'll think of
something, to be sure.

Jeez, I'm missing a
ton of parts lately.

35
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:32,541
I wonder if he's
been eating them.

36
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:35,166
[LUPIN] Pick up your junk and
this kind of thing won't happen.

37
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,833
[IMPEY] Why don't you mind
your own business, Lupin?!

38
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:40,666
[CARDIA]
Lupin, is Fran all right?

39
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,541
He hasn't eaten a thing
since yesterday.

40
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:45,916
[IMPEY] You're right, he's
been locked away in his lab.

41
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,250
Maybe he's upset about being
named the mastermind

42
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:49,375
of the train attack.

43
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:51,166
Somehow I doubt that.

44
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:55,416
Well, don't forget, Fran used
to work for Queen Victoria.

45
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,000
Now he's her enemy.

46
00:03:57,083 --> 00:04:00,250
Needless to say, Fran's
got a lot on his mind.

[FRAN]
Sometimes I forget to eat.

50
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:20,208
Once I start my work,
it's like I can't slow down.

Thank you for this.

52
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:24,000
Don't forget to give
yourself a break, Fran.

53
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:26,666
Work is important,
but so is rest.

54
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,250
[FRAN]
That's true.

55
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:29,833
You're very kind.

56
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:34,583
But don't fret over me, Cardia,
I'm not worth your time at all.

57
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:38,333
What about you?
You seem a little down.

58
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:40,250
Oh, no, I'm fine.

59
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:43,750
I'm just a bit confused
about Finis being my brother.

60
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:46,958
He said that he knew
a lot of things.

61
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:50,250
About my father, and
the Horologium, too.

62
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:54,875
What sort of game is Finis
trying to play with me, Fran?

63
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:56,375
Don't worry about all that.

64
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:58,666
You have plenty of
friends to keep you safe.

Lupin, Van, and the Count

to protect you from harm.

Oh, let's not forget
about Impey either.

And you. I can count
on you, too, right?

I'll do my best to be

You already are.

So did you hear? About
the prize for the race?

Yeah.

00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:20,458
Lupin. Why are you here?

162
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:23,083
I'm afraid we don't
have time to chat.

163
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:27,375
Run!

164
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:30,458
[LUPIN]
You ran off and disappeared

165
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:32,291
right before the
knighting ceremony.

166
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:34,250
I figured you were planning
some kind of maneuver

167
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:36,208
on our behalf!

168
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:37,375
It would appear we were right

169
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:40,166
to track the army's
movements after all.

170
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,125
You're a clever one.

171
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:43,583
Lupin!

172
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:47,166
[LUPIN] Impey's waiting for
you up ahead. Go on, run!

173
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,666
[FRAN]
What about you two?

174
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,625
[VAN] There aren't enough
of them to worry about.

175
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:52,166
Shouldn't be a problem.

176
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,500
Thanks.

177
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,625
Now then.

178
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:00,458
You're about to face down
the Gentleman Thief

179
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:01,916
and his henchman.

180
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,583
If I were you, I'd run
away while you still can.

181
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:06,375
I'm not your henchman.

182
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:10,583
[gunfire]

183
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:13,333
[CARDIA]
Impey!

184
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:14,500
[IMPEY]
Huh?

185
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:17,583
Hey! There you are!

186
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:20,916
I've missed you!
Glad to have you back!

187
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,083
Can this machine carry three?

188
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:25,041
[IMPEY]
Yeah, she can now.

189
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:27,625
She just takes a little
time to fire up!

190
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:30,583
Damn you, Professor Stein!

191
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:31,916
I will not let you escape!

192
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,208
We need to go now!

193
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:35,041
I know, I know!

194
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:38,000
[LEONHARDT yells]

195
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:45,083
[growls]

196
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:48,958
Ya see? Told ya she
could handle the load!

197
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:51,833
Come on! Time to make
a fashionable exit!

198
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:56,458
[SOLDIER H]
Stop right there!

199
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:02,458
[IMPEY]
So, where're we headed?

200
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:04,083
Buckingham Palace.

201
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:06,416
All right then. Let's go.

202
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,916
Wait! The palace?

203
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,708
Just drop me off and get
Cardia out of here, all right?

204
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,166
You're serious?

205
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:15,166
But, Fran, you can't
go all by yourself.

206
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,041
[IMPEY groans]

207
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:19,916
[IMPEY] I knew we'd run
into that monstrosity.

208
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:27,583
Huh?!

209
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:29,500
They're shooting in the
middle of the city!

210
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:31,791
[FRAN] Impey! Lose them
and get to the palace!

211
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:34,791
[IMPEY] That's easier
said than done, Fran!

212
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:36,958
[IMPEY yelping]

213
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:39,625
Damn! We're in
a tight spot here!

214
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:47,833
[IMPEY]
All right!

215
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:50,666
We're here! Buckingham Palace!

216
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,291
Uh-oh!

217
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:02,750
[VICTORIA gasps]

218
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:05,041
[SPECTATOR A]
Hey. What is that?

219
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:08,083
[CROWD shouting]

220
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:18,250
[CARDIA]
At least we landed.

221
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:19,625
[FRAN chuckles]

222
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:20,875
[IMPEY chuckles]

223
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:23,750
Well, I suppose it
could've been much worse!

224
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:26,666
[SOLDIER I] Frankenstein!
You're under arrest!

225
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:29,250
[FRAN]
Don't move!

226
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:30,958
This place is rigged with bombs.

227
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:32,791
Everyone back away, now!

228
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:34,291
But, Fran--

229
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:41,625
[FRAN] Try anything funny and
every single person here

230
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:43,625
gets blown to bits!

231
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,625
[FRAN]
Victoria!

232
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:49,875
Send your soldiers away
so we can talk! Now!

233
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,333
That's good.
Now stay where you are.

234
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:55,375
Fran, wait.

235
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:57,958
It'll be all right.
Just stay here.

236
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,125
It's been quite a while,
Mr. Professor.

237
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:07,333
I'll give you this much,

238
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:09,583
you certainly know how
to make an entrance.

239
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:11,583
[FRAN] If you don't want this
place to go up in flames,

240
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:14,208
you'll revoke our wanted
status immediately.

241
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:16,958
You'll guarantee the
safety of my friends.

242
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,458
And you will absolve us
of all responsibility.

243
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:20,625
I want your word.

244
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:23,500
[chuckles]

245
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:25,583
Do you seriously believe
you are in a position

246
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:29,041
to threaten the head of the
British Empire, Professor Stein?

247
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:31,375
This isn't like you at all.

248
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:33,875
It seems you've fallen in
with the wrong crowd.

249
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:36,500
Uh-oh. Are we sure
this is gonna work?

250
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:37,875
Pretty girl.

251
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:42,625
Cute. Sweet. Almost like
a man-made doll, isn't she?

252
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:43,875
[grunts]

253
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:45,958
[FRAN]
She has nothing to do with this!

254
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:49,833
Accept my demands.
Or your people will suffer!

255
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:52,083
Oh, please.

256
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:55,666
A silly toy like that
doesn't fool me one bit.

257
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:58,166
Don't forget, you're talking
to the Queen of England.

258
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:01,000
I'm not some naive child.

259
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:03,958
You're a terrible
negotiator, Professor.

260
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:06,375
[gasps]

261
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:08,416
--No!
--Cardia, stay back!

262
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,875
But, Fran--!

263
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:12,916
It's a liquid explosive.

264
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,875
If this hits the ground,
we're both dead.

265
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:18,416
You know I'm not bluffing.

266
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,416
I've taken steps to ensure
that the information

267
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,708
you want on Zicterium will
spread to other countries

268
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:25,833
if I die.

269
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:28,083
That's the scenario
you fear most of all,

270
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:30,041
isn't it, Your Majesty?

271
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:31,166
[VICTORIA]
Hm.

272
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:38,000
Well, it would appear
you're telling the truth.

273
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:39,958
I had such high
hopes for you, too.

274
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:42,166
And this is the way you
treat me in return.

275
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:45,375
Please. You betrayed
me, Your Highness.

276
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:49,375
Queen Victoria, no.
It isn't right.

277
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:50,791
[VICTORIA]
This country is surrounded

278
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:53,333
by major powers,
Professor Stein.

279
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:56,250
There's no telling when
one might do us harm.

280
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:58,208
We have only one recourse.

281
00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:01,875
To prevent their attacks by
showing our military might.

282
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:06,916
[FRAN] I can stop this!
There's still time!

283
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:16,166
[FRAN] No. This wasn't
supposed to happen.

284
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:23,208
[FRAN] Oh, God. I didn't
mean to create this.

285
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:27,833
Forgive me. I wanted
to help my country.

286
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:32,625
[screams]

287
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:38,500
Choose now, Victoria.
What's it going to be?

288
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:40,000
Die with me right now

289
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:43,208
and release that
knowledge to the world...

290
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:45,500
...or you can set us free.

291
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:06,333
[VICTORIA] Beloved citizens!
My loyal subjects!

292
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:07,375
Hear me.

293
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:09,500
It has just been
proven conclusively

294
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:12,458
that all the charges levied
against Victor Frankenstein

295
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:16,541
and his gang of conspirators
are categorically false.

296
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:21,916
Upon my crown and my royal oath,
I hereby guarantee their safety.

297
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,458
Any who try to do them harm

298
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:27,875
will be considered an enemy
of the British Empire.

299
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:29,833
Professor Stein.

300
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:32,125
Out of respect for your
admirable resolve,

301
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:34,625
I will grant you this
victory here today.

302
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:35,833
That said.

303
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:39,083
Henceforth, I advise you
to tread carefully.

304
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,500
[CARDIA]
Fran.

305
00:18:57,291 --> 00:18:59,541
There's something I want
you all to know.

306
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:01,583
Years back, when
I was an Alchemist,

307
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:04,416
I was involved with
a particular project.

308
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:09,375
You see, our objective was to
create the Philosopher's Stone.

309
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:11,166
The Philosopher's Stone?

310
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,708
Hold on a second,
I've heard of that before.

311
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:17,041
It turns metal into gold and
can give humans eternal life.

312
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:19,583
I don't understand, I thought
the stone was just a myth.

313
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:21,791
Doesn't that mean it's
impossible to make?

314
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:25,625
Yes. It seems
pretty foolish now.

315
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:29,916
But then, well, at the time,
I believed we could succeed.

316
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,583
So I attempted it.

317
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:36,125
And as a result, I created
something terrifying.

318
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:40,083
It's called Zicterium.
A diabolical poison.

319
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:44,458
They used it to fight vampires
in the war. To massacre them.

320
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:48,500
Do you mean--?

321
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:51,791
[FRAN] After that,
Isaac took over the project.

322
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:53,750
[LUPIN]
Isaac Beckford?

323
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:56,375
That's not all.

324
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:59,625
He made something
else with Zicterium.

325
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:02,958
It was the Horologium.

326
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:05,458
After seeing the poison I made
being used as a weapon,

327
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:07,166
I was terrified.

328
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:10,916
So I ran. And I
never looked back.

329
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,041
Please, Cardia. Forgive me.

330
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:17,583
All of the pain you've
experienced is my fault.

331
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:22,833
If I had never created that
poison, you wouldn't...

332
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:26,125
You wouldn't have had to--

333
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:27,541
[CARDIA]
You're wrong.

334
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:33,583
If it weren't for the
Horologium, I wouldn't be alive.

335
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:36,250
I enjoy being with all of you.

336
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:38,250
Where it feels warm.

337
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:42,041
That's what makes me happy.

338
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:46,166
If it weren't for you,
I wouldn't even be here.

339
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:50,000
You saved me. Thank you.

340
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:02,916
No, thank you, Cardia.

341
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:12,875
[FRAN] You know something?
That smile really suits you.

342
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:15,625
I'll make this right,
you'll see.

343
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:19,625
I swear to you, I'll get
rid of that poison.

344
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:21,541
Your wish isn't impossible.

345
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:23,666
It can come true, Cardia.

346
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:26,916
Give me a chance.
And I'll prove it.

347
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,250
[CARDIA] I gave up on
the idea of feeling warmth

348
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:31,416
on my skin long ago.

349
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,375
I accepted my fate:

350
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:36,458
That my dreams were
nothing but fantasies.

351
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:40,666
But now, he's offering
me a new kind of hope.

352
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:44,208
Should I allow myself
to have faith in a wish?

353
00:23:16,208 --> 00:23:18,541
To our freedom, gentlemen!

354
00:23:19,666 --> 00:23:20,583
[LUPIN chuckles]

355
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:22,458
How many toasts
have you made now?

356
00:23:22,541 --> 00:23:25,708
A lot. But for some
reason, I don't mind.

357
00:23:25,791 --> 00:23:26,875
I've had a thought.

358
00:23:26,958 --> 00:23:29,250
Isaac had a dedicated
research facility.

359
00:23:29,333 --> 00:23:30,708
If we can locate it somehow,

360
00:23:30,791 --> 00:23:32,958
we can move forward
with our plan of attack.

361
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:35,125
[SAINT]
It may be easier than you think.

362
00:23:35,208 --> 00:23:36,333
[CARDIA]
Saint?

363
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:38,083
Really, did you find something?

364
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:43,041
Yes, but it all falls on
one man's shoulders. Impey.

365
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:45,333
[IMPEY]
Hm?
