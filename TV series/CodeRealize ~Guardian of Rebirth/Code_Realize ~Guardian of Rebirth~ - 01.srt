a little routine

161
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:06,750
love maintenance on you, too.

162
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:09,541
Hey. I'll tune you
right up. Free of charge.

163
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:10,750
[chuckles]

164
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:13,875
Or not.

165
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:16,541
Impey. Just get us
moving already.

166
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:19,375
At this rate, we'll never
make it back to the mansion.

167
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:20,875
[IMPEY]
Yeah, yeah.

168
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:34,500
[LUPIN]
Hm?

169
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:37,041
Oh. You've never seen it before.

170
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:40,416
That, Princess, is the
industrial city of London.

171
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,916
She's a beauty, isn't she?

172
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,208
London is the home of our
beloved Queen Victoria,

173
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:47,208
and the political and economic
center of not only England,

174
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:48,958
but the whole world.

175
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:53,500
[IMPEY] Ah, I'm guessing
you've never stepped foot

176
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:56,000
inside a real city before.

177
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:59,791
In that case, you and I should
take a little time to-- Hm?

178
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:02,500
No way! Those things
are floating around now?

179
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:04,666
That poor guy sure has it rough.

180
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,000
If Saint hadn't taken him in,

181
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:08,416
he'd probably be
behind bars right now.

182
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,666
That's true.

183
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,708
Is he a terrorist?

184
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:14,250
Oh, yeah. He's bad.

185
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:17,208
You can form your own
opinion of him soon enough.

186
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:19,125
We'll be there in no time.

187
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:20,083
[CARDIA]
"There"?

188
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:22,666
[LUPIN]
Yep. At our stronghold.

189
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:29,791
[IMPEY]
Come on, Cardia. This way!

190
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:32,208
Guess who's back!

191
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:34,833
We just got in!

192
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:36,750
[FRAN]
Welcome home, you two.

193
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:38,416
Excellent work.

194
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:40,083
[CARDIA gasps]

195
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:42,583
Here, Fran. Look.

196
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:43,625
[FRAN]
Wow.

197
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:45,250
That's not good at all.

198
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:47,583
Well, don't worry,
it won't last.

199
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:49,666
The British Government is
far too busy fighting wars

200
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,833
against other nations right now.

201
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:53,375
By the way, well done, sir,

202
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:55,916
your sleeping agent
worked like a charm.

203
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,958
[FRAN]
Oh. I'm glad it was useful.

204
00:10:58,041 --> 00:11:00,125
Hey, Cardia.
Come and meet, Fran.

205
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:02,083
Don't be afraid, he's one of us.

206
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:05,333
Victor. Victor Frankenstein.
I'm glad you're here.

207
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:06,916
Uh. Thanks.

208
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,916
[IMPEY] There's one other guy
we work with. His name is Saint.

209
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,625
Yes, and Saint is, well,
our patron, you might call him.

210
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:16,833
Nice fellow. He let's us
use this mansion, actually.

211
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:17,708
Heh.

212
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:19,458
He'll show up sooner or later.

213
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:21,625
Lupin. Is it really her?

214
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:24,625
Yes, 100%.

215
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:28,208
She's Isaac Beckford's daughter,
there is no doubt.

216
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:31,375
Wait, does that mean
you know my father?

217
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:35,333
The famous Mr. Isaac Beckford.

218
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:38,958
There's hardly a soul in England
who doesn't know his name.

219
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:40,166
Yep. True.

220
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,000
London wouldn't be
nearly as prosperous

221
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:44,958
without the contributions
he's made to society.

222
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:48,916
[LUPIN] Your father is
an unparalleled genius.

223
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,875
Isaac made things that
should've been impossible

224
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:52,833
given the science
available to him,

225
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:55,416
and he did it all on his own.

226
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,416
As an example, the Horologium.

227
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,958
The what? What is that?

228
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:03,625
[LUPIN]
A device capable of creating

229
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:06,500
unprecedented amounts
of concentrated energy.

230
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:10,333
It's more commonly known as
the eternally beating heart.

231
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:11,791
Isaac used it on you.

232
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:16,208
Embedding the machine
inside your body.

233
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:18,125
The British Army
tried to kidnap you

234
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:21,875
because they want to use the
Horologium to their own ends.

235
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:23,083
British Army?

236
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:24,458
That's right.

237
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:26,541
They were using the Queen's
personal guard as pawns

238
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:28,375
in their little
abduction scheme.

239
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:30,166
You're kidding me.

240
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:34,208
[CARDIA]
I... I never knew.

241
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:37,416
I had no idea
what this thing was.

242
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,916
Truth is, I don't know why I
carry such a terrible poison

243
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,041
inside my body either.

244
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:48,541
You could say...
I don't know anything.

245
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:50,083
[IMPEY]
Cardia.

246
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:56,666
This is where
you'll be sleeping.

247
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,083
You look rather tired.

248
00:12:58,166 --> 00:13:00,625
If you'd like to call it
a night, go right ahead.

249
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:03,583
Wait, awkward question,
but how do you sleep?

250
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:06,458
[CARDIA] Much like my clothes,
my bed at the mansion was built

251
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:08,958
so it wouldn't dissolve from
the effects of the poison.

252
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:12,541
In that case,
this bed won't work.

253
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,208
Unlike my skin, my hair
doesn't do damage.

254
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:17,416
I'll be all right if
I sleep on my back.

255
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,833
Okay, then.

256
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:20,458
I'll have to talk
to Fran and see

257
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:23,166
if he can do anything
about the rest.

258
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:28,208
Until then, well,
I guess just do your best.

259
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:29,666
Good night.

260
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:32,125
Lupin?

261
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:36,750
I just wanted to ask you when
I might be able to go home.

262
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:37,958
I told you.

263
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:39,958
I came to steal your heart,
which means--

264
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:43,458
[rustling]

265
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:45,833
[LUPIN]
Whoa, whoa!

266
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:48,500
Wh-What the heck do
you think you're doing?

267
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:52,166
[CARDIA] By "heart" you mean
the Horologium, don't you?

268
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:56,291
I don't understand. Why does
everyone want these jewels?

269
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:58,916
I don't know anything
about my father at all.

270
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,333
And I don't know
much about myself.

271
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:03,666
I can't remember.

272
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:06,083
I have no memories of
anything that happened

273
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:08,583
prior to two years ago.

274
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:11,291
Sir, please tell me.

275
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:13,458
Why did my father
put this thing in me?

276
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:15,541
Fine, I'll tell you,
just cover yourself up!

277
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:17,333
It's not lady-like!

278
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:18,500
Why not?

279
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:21,333
A lady is supposed to
conceal her bosom!

280
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:22,833
All right then.

281
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:24,541
Count yourself lucky
I'm a gentleman.

282
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:27,875
If I hadn't been, Heaven only
knows what would've happened.

283
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:29,250
I wish I could be more helpful,

284
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:30,791
but I've already told you
everything I know

285
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:32,416
about your father.

286
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,666
Truth is, I have no earthly idea

287
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,250
why he put that thing
inside your chest.

288
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:42,083
Although, I do know why people
wanna get their hands on it.

289
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:43,625
Those men last night?

290
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:46,625
They were soldiers, but the army
wasn't pulling the strings.

291
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:49,000
There's a group controlling
them from the shadows.

292
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:52,375
Bad men. They're
known as Twilight.

293
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,166
Twilight?

294
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:55,666
[LUPIN]
Correct.

295
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:59,291
They want to use the Horologium
to do something terrible.

296
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:01,041
A large-scale terrorist plot

297
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:03,583
that would overthrow
all of London.

298
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:04,916
For all we know,

299
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,458
that was Isaac's intention
from the very beginning.

300
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:09,791
[CARDIA]
Are you saying that my father

301
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:12,291
is planning a terrorist attack?

302
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:13,958
[LUPIN] I'm saying the
reason I captured you

303
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:16,500
was to stop Twilight
from succeeding.

304
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:20,833
Cardia, we can't let them
acquire the Horologium.

305
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:24,750
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid
I cannot let you go home.

306
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:27,958
[CARDIA] Wait, don't go.
I can't stay here.

307
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:31,583
Please. Let me go.

308
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:35,208
You must be tired.

309
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:39,041
For right now,
try to get some sleep.

310
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,458
[LUPIN]
I will see this through.

311
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:48,083
If I succeed, maybe that
can be my atonement?

312
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:52,833
I hope I'm right, Master.

313
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:58,875
[ISAAC] You are a monster.
You bring misfortune to others.

314
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:02,708
That is why you must live your
life in complete isolation.

315
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:04,500
Yes, Father.

316
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:13,583
Oh. Well, hello there.

317
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:24,208
Do you live here in
this mansion, too?

318
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:29,583
[gasps]

319
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:32,500
[CARDIA]
Your leg! Poor thing!

320
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:35,625
[CARDIA]
Huh?

321
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:43,333
Wait, she's gone?

322
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:45,666
Maybe she got lost
wandering around the mansion.

323
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:48,166
No, I looked!
She's gone with the wind!

324
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,625
Lupin, you're the one
who saw her last, right?

325
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:52,208
What was she acting like then?

326
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:54,583
That's a very good question.

327
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:57,416
She seemed confused.
And a bit scared.

328
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,750
Oh, you think?! Well of
course she was scared!

329
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:02,083
"You'll never escape!
Ga-ha-ha-ha."

330
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:04,916
You say anything like that?

331
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,958
I might've mentioned it,

332
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:07,583
but I certainly
wasn't that crude.

333
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:09,833
[IMPEY] Agh! I can't
believe you did that!

334
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:14,750
Ugh! Lupin. Gah.
Are you kidding me?

335
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,750
She must be really scared.

336
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:19,458
Suddenly being kidnapped,
and then confined...

337
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:20,708
Confined? Please!

338
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:23,000
The girl is free
to come and go--

339
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:24,375
[ALL gasp]

340
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:27,375
I think I might
know where she is.

341
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:29,208
She's probably on her way home.

342
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:31,583
If she's on her way home,
that is definitely bad!

343
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:32,791
Twilight, the British Army,

344
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:34,416
and God knows who else
is looking for her.

345
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,541
If they get a hold of her,
then we're dead meat!

346
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:39,291
You're right.
We have to find her fast!

347
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:52,250
[SISI whines]

348
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:53,625
[CARDIA]
Thank goodness.

349
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:56,041
It's cold out here.
We should get you back inside.

350
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:59,458
[snarling]

351
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:02,958
Please don't!

352
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:06,333
No!

353
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,750
Cardia!

354
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:18,000
Don't scare me like that, okay?

355
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:19,625
[CARDIA]
I tried.

356
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:23,291
[CARDIA]
I couldn't help.

357
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:27,875
It died... because of me.

358
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:30,583
My father was right all along.

359
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:32,708
I am a monster.

360
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:35,958
I only bring
misfortune to others.

361
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:39,291
That's why I must
live in isolation.

362
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,250
No, you're wrong.

363
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:51,291
[LUPIN]
There's not a soul on this earth

364
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:54,208
who deserves to live
their life like that.

365
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:57,458
Love yourself. You're
more than you think.

366
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:01,916
My angel!

367
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,416
I'm so glad you're safe!

368
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,291
Oh, Cardia! We were
so worried about you!

369
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:08,916
[LUPIN]
Please stay with us, Cardia.

370
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,375
It looks like Sisi here has
taken a liking to you as well.

371
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:14,875
[IMPEY]
I've got an idea!

372
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:16,916
Let's throw Cardia
a big welcome party!

373
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,041
[FRAN]
Right now?

374
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:20,083
I think we should
probably go to bed.

375
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:20,958
[IMPEY]
Whatever, we can sleep...

376
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:22,541
They make a lot of noise,

377
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:25,833
but honestly, they're some of
the best friends I could have.

378
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:29,375
Your... friends?

379
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:31,416
Lupin?

380
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,416
Thank you.

381
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,416
You've all been so nice to me,

382
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,375
but I still don't know
if I should stay.

383
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:38,916
Sorry.

384
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:45,625
Although... this place
does seem really warm!

385
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:47,541
Then I think you ought to stay.

386
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:50,083
If that's what you want,
that's what you should do.

387
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:52,791
The problem is,
I don't know what I want.

388
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:55,208
You do. You wanna
know the truth.

389
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:56,833
The truth about your father.

390
00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:58,250
The truth about you.

391
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:02,458
You said so yourself.
All you have to do is act.

392
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:04,041
No more waiting.

393
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:07,041
We'll go looking for
the answers together.

394
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:10,125
I'm Arsène Lupin,
the Gentleman Thief.

395
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:13,083
If there's something
I want, I take it.

396
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:14,666
If you stay here with us,

397
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:17,541
we'll help you find the
answers you're looking for.

398
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:25,375
Glad you're here, Cardia.

399
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:47,958
Don't freeze up on me.
It's unbecoming.

400
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,208
[LUPIN]
Let's see now.

401
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:56,458
I told you I was going to steal
that precious heart, remember?

402
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:58,625
But there's something
I didn't say.

403
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:01,583
In return, I promise
to grant you one wish.

404
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:03,208
A wish?

405
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:05,958
Yes, indeed.

406
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:07,708
You heard me correctly, Cardia.

407
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:09,958
This humble thief swears
to do everything he can

408
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:14,000
to grant your wish and will not
stop until the task is done.

409
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:15,583
[CARDIA]
No.

410
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:20,083
This might sound strange,
but nothing comes to mind.

411
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:24,041
I've never even thought
about that. Sorry.

412
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:26,416
Is that right?

413
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,916
Well, no rush.
The offer still stands.

414
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,958
Come on. Let's go.

415
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,375
[CARDIA]
My heart responds to his words,

416
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:37,375
and the sound of his voice.

417
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:41,125
Something I thought was tightly
sealed deep within my chest

418
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:43,750
seems to be rattling
as it stirs.

419
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:46,041
[chuckles]

420
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:49,083
[CARDIA] There are many
things I want to know.

421
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:51,333
Where is my father?

422
00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:54,583
And... what am I?

423
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:57,291
Will I ever know the truth?
