But I'll admit,
that was a close call.

The source of your poison,

accurate my calculations are.

00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:35,333
[LUPIN] In that case,
it's all or nothing.

134
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:38,000
The timing has to be perfect.

135
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:39,833
We need to leave
a little energy.

136
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:42,000
Just enough to
keep Cardia alive.

137
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:43,791
And to get her out in one piece.

138
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:46,333
If we manage to make this work,

139

and it is a massive if, we'll
render the poison obsolete.

If I'm being completely honest,

141
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,333
for a moment there,
I wasn't sure this would work.

142
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:57,458
I only had a split
second to act.

143
00:07:57,541 --> 00:08:00,041
I knew if I was off, even
by a fraction of a second,

144
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:01,958
the plan would be a disaster.

145
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:05,166
But looks like I
was right on time.

You did all that just
to save her life?

Well, you can do as you please.

Her part in this story has
already come to an end.

All he ever wanted was
for you to love him

and to be proud of him.

he did for you!

about us, Father.

This is tyranny!

You witless rogue.
What did you do?

You're the genius

The bombs we made
were quite simple.

I'm assuming you do
remember what bombs are.

I suppose hubris has always
been your Achilles heel.

You lost, Isaac.

It's time to call it quits!

I won't give up!

the world is bound for
destruction and despair!

It's true, humans are foolish.

to change that, Isaac.

Humans are never
going to change.

To see that, all you have
to do is look at the past.

now let me touch
your skin, as well.

[gasps]

326
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:28,333
[CARDIA gasps]

327
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:31,166
Lupin. I feel so...

328
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,458
[LUPIN]
Cardia!

329
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,750
I'm so sorry, Lupin.

330
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:51,208
Don't apologize.

331
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:55,666
I'm just glad to be here by
your side where I belong.

332
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:59,958
Even if it's short-lived,
it's worth every moment.

333
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:03,166
I love you, Lupin.
And I always will.

334
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:06,250
I love you, too,
Cardia. Forever.

335
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:35,708
Take this.


336
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:37,958
[IMPEY]
Stop right there!

337
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:39,291
Stop. Why?

338
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:42,000
I'm positive there's no
way the answer is yes,


339
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:44,916
but just in case, did you
make those by any chance?


340
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,916
So what if I did, Impey?


341
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,208
Are you kidding me?


342
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:49,416
If you cooked the food,


343
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,083
then this'll be our
last supper for sure!


344
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:53,416
Open your mouth again


345
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,333
and you'll get a lot more
than an hors d'oeuvre.


346
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:57,125
Van, come on,
I'm a brilliant chef


347
00:18:57,208 --> 00:19:00,625
and even I don't know
how to cook with bullets.

348
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:02,250
[FRAN]
Pretty flowers.

349
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,291
For her?

350
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:07,875
Yes.

351
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:09,458
[IMPEY]
Whoa, hang on!


352
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:11,166
Has anyone seen Saint?

353
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,750
No. That's weird.


354
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:15,750
I swear he was just
here a minute ago.


355
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:18,041
[VAN]
That's typical of him.

356
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:22,125
[clanking]


357
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:24,166
You went to the trouble
of coming all this way,


358
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:27,916
you could've at least
dressed for the occasion.


359
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,875
[GUINEVERE] I have orders
to finalize things here.


360
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:35,666
Yes, I see. I made my views on
this subject abundantly clear.


361
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:38,208
And those views
have not changed.


362
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:44,250
Though I'd be lying
if I said I'm surprised.


363
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:45,625
There's no doubt in my mind.


364
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:47,208
If Idea would have had its way,


365
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:49,583
the girl would've ended up
just like <i>The Nautilus</i> .


366
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:51,083
Non-existent.


367
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:54,708
However, as I'm sure
you know by now,

368
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:57,625
our little group is not
the sort to give up.

369
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:17,291
[GUINEVERE]
This is senseless.

370
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:22,083
[GUINEVERE] I don't have the
time, or the inclination,


371
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:24,000
to play your games.


372
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:28,416
Are you sure about this?


373
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:31,708
You must never let the
girl out of your sight,


374
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:33,583
for as long as you both live.


375
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:35,541
Take care of yourself.

Cardia.

00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:46,916
[CARDIA]
Lupin!


379
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,291
Well, you haven't changed yet.


380
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:51,333
[CARDIA]
Neither have you.


381
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:52,958
[LUPIN]
Are you nervous?


382
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:54,375
I guess?


383
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:57,125
I don't know. I'm a bit tense.


384
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:58,375
You're tense?


385
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:01,583
Yes. Truth is, I'm thrilled.


386
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:07,000
[CARDIA]
But I wonder...

387
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:11,250
How is it possible
that I'm still alive?

388
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:14,166
I know for certain the
Horlogium's energy expired

389
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,375
when we were on
board <i>The Nautilus</i> .

390
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:18,916
And yet here I am with you,

391
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,250
a normal person with no
more poison in my veins.

392
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,291
[CARDIA]
Who was it that gave me my life?


393
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:32,958
Finis? My father? Someone else?


394
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,541
Honestly, Cardia, I don't
think it was any of them.

395
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:38,708
Truth is... it was you.

396
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:42,791
It was the awesome
power of love.


397
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:44,375
That's my guess.

You're here!

Forgive the delay.

No. She's a goddess!
Damn it, Van! It's not fair!

do to deserve her?

At this rate,
I'm a bit concerned

00:22:42,416 --> 00:22:44,541
they won't have a chance
to exchange vows.

Well, Lupin, shall we postpone?

No matter what, I will always

Honestly,

you didn't have to
steal my heart at all.

It was yours from the
very first glance.
