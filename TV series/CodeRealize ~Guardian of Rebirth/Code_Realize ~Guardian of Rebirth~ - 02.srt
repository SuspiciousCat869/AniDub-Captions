Hope you're hungry because
breakfast is-- Uh.

4
00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:14,000
Well, look at that.

5
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:24,208
Take it easy, Sisi.
I know, I'm hungry, too!

6
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:26,833
Don't worry. I haven't
forgotten you.

7
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:29,208
[IMPEY]
Here.

8
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:31,250
So did you sleep all right?

9
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:32,541
[gasps]

10
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:34,916
About that...

11
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
There's a problem with
our household items.

12
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:39,666
She melts everything
she touches,

13
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,166
so she'll need a new pillow.

14
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,375
[chuckles]

15
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:45,250
[IMPEY]
And utensils, too!

16
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:47,458
You can't eat sandwiches
for every meal.

17
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:49,125
I am a genius chef, you know.

18
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:51,791
Eventually, I'd like to
show off my cooking skills.

19
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:54,333
The sandwiches you made
for dinner were delicious.

20
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:56,125
I really enjoyed them.

21
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:59,583
I didn't realize that you
were such a good cook.

22
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:02,666
You're the best, Cardia!
Like an angel in the flesh!

23
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:03,750
Marry me!

24
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:04,875
If you touch me, you'll melt.

[LUPIN chuckles]

[SAINT] You all sound
like you're having fun.

30
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:17,041
[LUPIN]
Saint? You're back.

31
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:19,625
Saint?

32
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:23,000
[IMPEY] There's one other guy
we work with. His name is Saint.

33
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:25,083
[LUPIN]
He'll show up sooner or later.

34
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:26,416
[gasps]

35
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:30,125
Welcome to my mansion.
The name's Saint-Germain.

36
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:34,666
It's a pleasure to make your
acquaintance, dear Cardia.

37
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:38,416
The truth is, I've been waiting
for you for a very long time.

38
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,041
Really? Waiting for me?

39
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:43,083
Hey! No hitting on Cardia!

40
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:44,875
Like you're one to talk.

41
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:46,458
[chuckles]

42
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:47,791
[SAINT]
Uhh...

43
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:49,291
[chuckles]

44
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:57,333
[LUPIN]
Saint has some strange tastes,

45
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:59,833
but he does a lot to
support our efforts here.

46
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:01,458
Nobility is so boring.

47
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,541
Right? Right!

48
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:06,125
He's so bored that he
even takes in terrorists!

49
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:08,875
Come on! I told you,
I was framed!

50
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:10,333
[IMPEY chuckles]

51
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,333
[gasps]

52
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:12,500
[FRAN]
Uh.

53
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:14,250
I used to be employed
by the government.

54
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:16,375
But I just did research.

55
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:18,791
Fran here was the
Head Royal Alchemist,

56
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:21,458
basically an elite
among the elites!

57
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:23,000
I'm not an elite anymore.

58
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:25,125
I'm on the run from
the government.

59
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:27,583
So you quit? But why?

60
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:29,000
[gasps]

61
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:30,750
Oh, uh.

62
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:39,375
Uh, well, everybody
has a thing or two

63
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:41,416
they don't wanna
talk about, right?

64
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,750
The question is this:

65
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:45,125
What is our next
move going to be?

66
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:49,333
We successfully stole the
Horologium away from Twilight.

67
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:51,666
That was the first
phase of the plan.

68
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,583
So for now, we should
just lie low.

69
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:57,666
Focus our energy on gathering
information about their network.

70
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,208
[IMPEY]
Hmm...

71
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:01,875
There's gotta be a way to make
things move a little faster.

72
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:04,291
We could try kidnapping
the leader of Twilight!

73
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:07,500
Slug him real good and say,
"No more terrorism, you jerk!"

74
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:09,500
I'm not so sure that you
and I are strong enough

75
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:11,041
to get away with that.

76
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:13,250
Well, we know this
much for certain:

77
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:14,958
Cardia's with us now.

78
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:18,125
She can give us some clues
to help us on our way.

79
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:19,791
[CARDIA]
Huh?

80
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:27,875
[FINIS]
What a disappointment.

81
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:31,041
I can't believe you let some
petty thief steal our prey.

82
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:34,791
How far the Royal Family's
personal guard has fallen.

83
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:36,666
Things certainly have changed.

84
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:40,041
Wouldn't you agree,
Your Majesty?

85
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:42,375
If you had disclosed
more accurate information

86
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:44,000
about the monster
in the first place,

87
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:46,041
then none of this
would've ever happened.

88
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:48,833
Surely you would
agree with that.

89
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:51,166
Finis, leader of Twilight.

90
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,666
[FINIS laughs]

91
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,083
What a hypocrite!

92
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:57,041
I'd say keeping secrets
is your forte!

93
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:59,166
While London prospers
on all fronts,

94
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,583
so many have shed
blood in the shadows.

95
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:04,583
Humans. And those
not quite human.

96
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:06,541
How many filthy,
unspeakable jobs

97
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:10,083
do you think we've accepted
on your behalf, My Queen?

98
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:19,250
In any case, you can forget
all about this mission.

99
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:20,833
Our soldiers are on the move.

100
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:23,708
They'll recover our
prey soon enough.

101
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:26,208
Are you telling me you've set
those ignoble men of yours

102
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:27,791
loose in my fair city?

103
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:30,791
Before you turn your ire on me,
remember, we wouldn't be here

104
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:32,916
if it weren't for the
failure of your dogs.

105
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,791
Perhaps a meeting to
discuss your shortcomings

106
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:37,375
as a leader is required.

107
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:39,083
Finis.

108
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:41,208
You may think you have
me under your thumb,

109
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:43,125
but I want you to
remember something.

110
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:44,958
You were born in this
country, and as such,

111
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:48,541
I still consider you one
of my precious children.

112
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:50,541
When a child starts
to misbehave,

113
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:52,916
it is his mother's
duty to punish him.

114
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,375
Do keep that in mind, Finis.

115
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:10,958
[FRAN]
Thank you.

116
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:14,291
Well, Fran? Did you
learn anything?

117
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:20,083
The poison inside of her body
is a result of the Horologium.

118
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:23,000
Is it possible we can
remove it somehow?

119
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:24,708
[FRAN]
No.

120
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:27,541
I can't recommend that.

121
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:29,833
I sort of predicted this, but...

122
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:34,875
Cardia, I don't hear a
heart beat inside of you.

123
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:36,291
I can't be sure,

124
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:39,666
but it's entirely possible
your heart has been lost.

125
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,791
I don't have a... heart?

126
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:44,958
[FRAN]
That's not entirely accurate.

127
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:48,416
What keeps you alive is the
eternally-beating heart,

128
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,166
the Horologium itself.

129
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,916
It has taken the
place of your heart.

130
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:03,750
Well! Cardia, let's go to town!

131
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:05,458
You mean now?

132
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:08,166
Hey, there's no time
like the present, right?

133
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:41,833
You may proceed!

134
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:44,250
Baron Gilford Dudley and party.

135
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:54,833
Well done!

136
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:57,250
Won't you be seen?

137
00:08:57,333 --> 00:09:00,083
We're safe once we've
passed the inspection.

138
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:02,041
[LUPIN] The Yard is
probably short staffed.

139
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,500
Their resources have
been diminished

140
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:05,000
due to the recent
string of thefts

141
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:07,041
targeting noble households.

142
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:10,083
[IMPEY]
Oh. That flashy thief, right?

143
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:12,625
It's not me.

144
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:14,500
[FRAN]
Well, this is my stop.

145
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:16,083
[CARDIA]
You're not coming with us?

146
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:17,166
As a matter of fact,

147
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,208
there's something
I need to pick up.

148
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:20,833
Hey. You ready?

149
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:22,708
What? I'm staying with Cardia!

150
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:25,875
Have you already forgotten you
promised to help me out today?

151
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:27,458
[IMPEY whines]

152
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:28,750
Since it's the two of us,

153
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:31,583
how about we treat
ourselves to a little date?

154
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:33,583
A date?

155
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,208
[CARDIA]
There are so many people,

156
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:40,000
both inside and
outside of the gate.

157
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:43,125
Did my father really
commit terrorist acts here?

158
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:46,541
[LUPIN]
Yes. Sadly, there is no doubt.

159
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:47,958
[CARDIA]
What if...?

160
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:51,208
What if a terrorist attack
were to happen right now?

161
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:53,833
[LUPIN] A lot of people
would die, Cardia.

162
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:57,208
You see? That's why
we have to act fast.

163
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,416
So!

164
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,625
Next, I'll take you to the
busiest place in London Town!

165
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:23,375
[CARDIA]
This is a casino?

166
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:25,250
Yeah. How did you know?

167
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,666
I read about them.

168
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:29,166
People come here
to get more money.

169
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,333
[LUPIN] That's not all
you can get here though.

170
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:33,500
The casino is an
underground trade show,

171
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:35,833
for all kinds of information.

172
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:38,166
[CARDIA]
Gathering information?

173
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,125
I hope I wasn't in the way.

174
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:41,333
In the way?

175
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:44,208
[CARDIA]
Since I can't do anything,

176
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:48,458
I can't talk to people
like you can, Lupin.

177
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:51,500
[LUPIN laughs]

178
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:53,625
You are a woman of few words,

179
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:55,791
but I wouldn't worry
about that too much.

180
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:57,833
The real reason we're here
is because I thought

181
00:10:57,916 --> 00:11:00,541
it might make for a
charming change of pace.

182
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:02,875
[CARDIA] Why are you
doing all of this for me?

183
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:04,291
[LUPIN]
Huh?

184
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:08,208
You, Fran, and Impey have all
been so very kind to me.

185
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:11,000
But I... don't know why.

186
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,541
You saw Sisi. His leg.

187
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:18,583
[CARDIA]
Mh-hm.

188
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:22,750
Apparently, some complete
stranger decided to lopp it off.

189
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:26,000
Impey brought him home with him,
and made him that leg.

190
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:29,083
He was crying like a
baby the entire time.

191
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:31,541
His love may be
a one-way street...

192
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:36,500
...but Sisi is alive today
because of what Impey did.

193
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:38,916
You see, Cardia, the truth is,

194
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
it's the exact same with you.

195
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:42,625
You may not have a heart,

196
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:45,000
but that doesn't mean
you're not alive.

197
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:47,583
The way I see it, you're
no different than us.

198
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:49,250
Wouldn't you agree?

199
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:55,541
That's good.

200
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:57,875
And besides, a heart doesn't
really start beating

201
00:11:57,958 --> 00:11:59,875
until you find the
person you love!

202
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:01,458
[CARDIA]
Huh?

203
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:03,750
[LUPIN] Whether you're a man or
a woman, when you fall in love,

204
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:06,500
all you wanna do is
touch that person.

205
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:07,791
When you hold them

206
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:10,416
and you feel their warmth
against your body...

207
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,333
...this starts to beat.

208
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:23,250
I want to touch.

209
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:24,166
[LUPIN]
Uh.

210
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,541
[CARDIA]
Earlier when we spoke,

211
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:29,041
you said you would
grant me a wish.

212
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:32,166
And so, I would
like to touch you.

213
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:35,416
To know what it's like
to feel your warmth.

214
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:40,083
Um. That is... simply one
hell of a pick-up line.

215
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:42,291
Pick-up line?

216
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:44,125
Never mind that.

217
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:48,041
I completely understand.

218
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:50,750
I swear on my name,
Arséne Lupin,

219
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:54,583
right here, I will grant your
wish no matter the cost.

220
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:59,166
I'll save the kiss until then.

221
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:05,000
Lupin?

222
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,625
Cardia. We're leaving now.

223
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:28,666
[IMPEY]
Oh.

224
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,750
[IMPEY chuckles]

225
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:35,000
[IMPEY]
Beautiful women are the best!

226
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:36,833
I'm all done.

227
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:37,500
Hm?

228
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:38,625
[IMPEY]
Hm?

229
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:50,666
[LUPIN]
Twilight!

230
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:57,541
[OPERATIVE B]
Huh?!

231
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:58,458
What?

232
00:13:58,541 --> 00:13:58,833
[OPERATIVE C]
They're gone?

233
00:13:58,916 --> 00:13:59,916
[bang]

234
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:07,625
[CARDIA yelps]

235
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:19,583
[LUPIN]
The bastards flanked us.

236
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:32,291
[OPERATIVES yelp]

237
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:38,875
[groans]

238
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,000
[VAN]
Don't move.

239
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:46,666
They're just salt shells, but
they will hurt if they hit you.

240
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,958
Arsène Lupin.

241
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:51,333
I don't think we've
met yet, Pretty Boy.

242
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:54,666
Well, you're not quite
as pretty as me.

243
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:57,875
Give me the monster now.

244
00:14:57,958 --> 00:14:59,291
Don't try to play
the fool, Lupin,

245
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:02,000
I know you stole
Twilight's prey from them.

246
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:03,791
Just hand it over, all right?

247
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:05,291
I'm sorry, my friend,

248
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:08,166
but I haven't the slightest idea
what you're talking about.

249
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:14,041
Wait, the monster you're
looking for is me.

250
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:15,750
Whatever you do,
don't hurt Lupin.

251
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:17,333
Hey! Cardia!

252
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:21,333
Wait, you... you're the monster?

253
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:22,833
[FRAN]
Get down, guys!

254
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:29,708
Let's go! Come on! Hurry!

255
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:33,583
Thanks a lot. Cardia,
come on, we should-- Uh!

256
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:37,583
It's easier to run like this.

257
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:39,291
Fine.

258
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:41,791
Just... don't fall down.

259
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:51,833
[VAN]
Hmph.

260
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,166
[ALL gasp]

261
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,166
Come on! Quick, get in!

262
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:04,458
[IMPEY]
Did we lose them?

263
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:06,000
[LUPIN]
For now.

264
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:08,250
Not only did that guy
know exactly who I am,

265
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:09,750
but he put out a net.

266
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:12,458
We should assume he
knows our escape route.

267
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:15,416
If anyone could, it'd be him.

268
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,458
[LUPIN]
Huh?

269
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:18,625
[CARDIA]
Fran, do you know that man?

270
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:21,958
[FRAN] Yeah. I saw him back
when I lived at the palace.

271
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:23,333
[LUPIN]
Palace?

272
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,458
[ALL gasp]

273
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:33,375
[crash]

274
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:42,541
Cardia, you okay? Talk to me.

275
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:43,708
Yes. Thanks.

276
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:44,750
[gasps]

277
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:53,833
Lupin! Cardia!

278
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:55,916
That's him all right.

279
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,375
He used to be a
member of Twilight.

280
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:00,708
They called him
"The Human Weapon."

281
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:04,250
His name is Abraham Van Helsing.

282
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:06,208
[VAN]
Woman.

283
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:09,041
What do they mean when
they call you a monster?

284
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:11,375
Do you carry the
jewels inside you?

285
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:14,291
The famed jewels
of the Horologium?

286
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:21,875
My name is Cardia.

287
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:25,250
I am the daughter
of Issac Beckford.

288
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:28,791
You're Isaac
Beckford's daughter?

289
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:33,083
I see. In that case,
you'll make excellent bait.

290
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:34,583
[FRAN]
Wait.

291
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:36,708
It sounds like you must
be planning to use her

292
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:40,458
in an attempt to make some
kind of deal with Twilight.

293
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:42,875
Tell us what
you're really after.

294
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:46,500
[VAN]
I have only one target in mind.

295
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:49,916
The leader of Twilight. Finis.

296
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,083
I promise you this:

297
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:54,625
I'll make him pay for the
atrocities he's committed

298
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:57,291
upon the people of this city.

299
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:59,000
This woman...

300
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:03,083
...she is an important
pawn in my plan.

301
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:07,208
[FRAN] In that case,
I have an offer for you.

302
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:08,625
A better way.

303
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:09,666
Work with us.

304
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:10,541
[IMPEY]
Huh?

305
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:12,541
[VAN]
Work with you?

306
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,875
[FRAN] If you consider
both of our objectives,

307
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:18,625
working together should benefit
you as much as it would us.

308
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:22,041
[IMPEY] Whoa! Hang on, Fran!
Think about what you're saying!

309
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:24,375
Hey. It sounds good to me.

310
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:26,291
[IMPEY]
Huh?!

311
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:29,500
Even if we should escape,
it won't change anything.

312
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:31,708
But if you were to
join forces with us,

313
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:33,375
we would definitely
be powerful enough

314
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:35,291
to go up against Twilight.

315
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:37,250
I'd say it's a win-win.

316
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:41,208
I see. Wait, really?

317
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:43,875
What do ya say?

318
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:48,125
I refuse. This
conversation is over.

319
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:50,500
Come, woman.

320
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:55,625
Lupin.

321
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:58,541
I'm sorry, but I
can't allow a man

322
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:01,291
who would turn down our offer
to escort her anywhere.

323
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:02,916
Clearly you don't have the sense

324
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,166
to be entrusted
with such a task.

325
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,083
[VAN]
Suit yourself.

326
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:08,625
No!

327
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:09,833
[gunshot]

328
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:23,666
Lupin.

329
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,458
Nice work!

330
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:31,666
A special trick of mine.
What do you think?

331
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:34,916
My gun. Tell me how.

332
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,791
Oh, you want me to
reveal how I did it?

333
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:41,291
I put sticky putty on a ball
I stole from the casino

334
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:42,833
and stuffed it in the
muzzle of your gun

335
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:44,458
when you weren't looking.

336
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:46,833
[IMPEY]
When did you do that?

337
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:48,708
[LUPIN] While my
perceptive assistant here

338
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:50,791
was talking up a storm.

339
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:57,166
Anyway, if you want,
the offer still stands.

340
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,916
Our goal is to stop Twilight.

341
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,583
But we don't have the man-power
to face them alone.

342
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:03,250
If we had someone
like you on our side,

343
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:05,500
that might change the equation.

344
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:07,416
[VAN]
You're very honest.

345
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,958
But the way I see it,

346
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:12,625
you three need me a heck of
a lot more than I need you.

347
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:13,666
[FRAN]
If you join us,

348
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,208
we'd be able to
pull off operations

349
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:17,250
none of us could ever do alone.

350
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:20,125
The more our enemy
comes to despise us,

351
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:22,416
the thicker our red
thread of fate grows.

352
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,208
I can guarantee that.

353
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:28,458
Finis will reveal himself
to us, without a doubt.

354
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:30,041
I'll ask again.

355
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:32,083
Do you want to work together?

356
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,416
[sighs]

357
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,458
[VAN]
Fine.

358
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:39,583
You've got yourself a deal.

359
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:41,375
Victor Frankenstein.

360
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:44,750
Huh? Wait. You know my name?

361
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:45,958
Yes, of course I do.

362
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:47,250
How could I not
remember the name

363
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:49,875
of the former Head
Royal Alchemist?

364
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:52,708
[chuckles]

365
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:54,125
Well, guys,

366
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:57,250
if that's that, can we
consider the matter resolved?

367
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:59,666
So does this mean
he's one of us now?

368
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:00,708
[LUPIN]
Hm?

369
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:04,250
Yeah. Well, I hope so, at least.

370
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:07,875
This guy's got some very
complicated motivations.

371
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:14,083
[CARDIA] I feel like his cold
eyes could hold me prisoner.

372
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:16,041
Because when I look
deep inside them,

373
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:18,750
I see a sad color
in their depths.

374
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:20,833
Why is he crying inside?

375
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:24,500
I wonder, what is he
hiding in his heart?

376
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,208
--Ha!
--[IMPEY] Whoa...

377
00:23:02,291 --> 00:23:04,500
I knew you would
figure it out, Fran!

378
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:07,875
Now I can really show off
my expert skills as a chef!

379
00:23:07,958 --> 00:23:09,750
This is great. Thanks.

380
00:23:09,833 --> 00:23:11,500
You're welcome, Cardia.

381
00:23:11,583 --> 00:23:13,166
Oh, yeah. May I?

382
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:14,375
[LUPIN, IMPEY yelp]

383
00:23:14,458 --> 00:23:15,791
I would give anything
to understand

384
00:23:15,875 --> 00:23:17,291
how this dress was made.

385
00:23:17,375 --> 00:23:19,833
As far as I can tell, the
material seems fairly normal,

386
00:23:19,916 --> 00:23:22,333
so perhaps there was something
used to coat the surface?

387
00:23:22,416 --> 00:23:23,458
Fran!

388
00:23:23,541 --> 00:23:24,625
[FRAN]
Huh?

389
00:23:24,708 --> 00:23:27,750
Oh! No, I'm sorry!
I didn't mean any harm!

390
00:23:28,833 --> 00:23:30,541
I don't mind.

391
00:23:35,291 --> 00:23:38,000
[SAINT] It looks like
yet another red thread

392
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,791
has become tangled
around him now.
