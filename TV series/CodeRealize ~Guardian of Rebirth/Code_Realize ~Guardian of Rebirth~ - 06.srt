1
00:00:09,625 --> 00:00:11,500
[IMPEY] You want me
to rebuild an airship?

2
00:00:11,583 --> 00:00:13,541
I think I can probably
handle that.

3
00:00:13,625 --> 00:00:15,166
[SAINT]
I'm glad to hear it.

4
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:17,416
The Black Gathering
is coming up soon.

5
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,833
I'd like you to enter
the race and win it.

6
00:00:19,916 --> 00:00:22,875
Come on! You've gotta
be kidding me, right?

7
00:00:22,958 --> 00:00:24,833
I've never heard
of that before.

8
00:00:24,916 --> 00:00:26,666
Well, that's not surprising.

9
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:30,625
The Mafia puts it on.
It's a semi-annual airship race.

10
00:00:30,708 --> 00:00:33,583
This year the grand prize
is of particular interest.

11
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:36,583
The winner gets the unpublished
writings of Isaac Beckford.

12
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:38,000
[gasps]

13
00:00:38,083 --> 00:00:40,041
My father's writings?

14
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:44,375
You don't get the chance to see
writings like that very often.

15
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:47,291
If we win, we might find
some useful clues.

16
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:48,541
Indeed.

17
00:00:48,625 --> 00:00:50,125
If we're lucky, those
documents will point us

18
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:52,583
in the direction of Isaac's lab.

19
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:55,458
Given that, I think it's
well worth our time.

20
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:58,958
I agree the papers are key.

21
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:01,333
But there's got to
be another way.

22
00:01:01,416 --> 00:01:02,166
Heh.

23
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:03,916
Perhaps I can be of service.

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,375
[SAINT]
Perhaps.

25
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:07,208
You'll have to best
Herlock Sholmes.

26
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:10,500
From what I gather, he's
guarding the grand prize.

27
00:01:13,291 --> 00:01:15,083
All right! We shall
enter the race!

28
00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:16,541
You changed your
mind pretty fast.

29
00:01:16,625 --> 00:01:17,958
[FRAN chuckles]

30
00:01:18,041 --> 00:01:21,166
Lupin, I think there's something
you forgot to consider.

31
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:23,083
We don't have our own airship.

32
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:26,500
Have no fear, Fran, the
Gentleman Thief is on the case!

33
00:01:26,583 --> 00:01:27,875
[chuckles]

34
00:01:27,958 --> 00:01:30,708
Well, what do you say?
Can we count on you, Impey?

35
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:33,708
Wow! An air race!

36
00:01:33,791 --> 00:01:36,958
I'll get to show off my
genius engineering skills!

37
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:11,250
[DELACROIX] That Lupin sure
is something, isn't he?

38
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:13,916
Where in the world did he
even manage to get that thing?

39
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,458
I don't know, but he said it was

40
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:17,666
"from a source that would
cause us no guilt."

41
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,916
Whatever that's
supposed to mean.

42
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,625
[LUPIN]
Oh, yes. That.

43
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:26,958
Don't worry, it's nothing.

44
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,125
[CARDIA]
Lupin.

45
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,291
Hm? Now where's Impey?

46
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:32,083
I don't see him anywhere.

47
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:33,541
[CARDIA]
He's in the workshop.

48
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:36,291
Apparently, he's
rebuilding the engine.

49
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:37,875
[LUPIN]
I see.

50
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:40,583
While we're getting the money
together, will you watch him?

51
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:42,958
The truth is, he
might need a hand.

52
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:44,458
[CARDIA]
Of course.

53
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:45,916
And if he tries anything,

54
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,791
you don't have to show
any mercy in punishing him.

55
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:50,958
No mercy.

56
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:53,791
Van recently taught me
an effective kick.

57
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:57,833
That looks quite
effective indeed.

58
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:02,750
There's that smile.
Makes me feel invincible.

59
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:05,666
I think you have a
really nice smile, too!

60
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,583
[CARDIA]
Thanks, Drac. You're sweet.

61
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:09,041
[LUPIN chuckles]

62
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:10,541
[IMPEY sighs]

63
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,541
[IMPEY] Make the walls thicker
to increase air pressure.

64
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:13,875
And then,

65
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:16,208
I might as well overhaul
the entire control system.

66
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:19,375
Impey. How's it going?

67
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:21,625
Hungry?

68
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:22,833
[IMPEY]
Hm?

69
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:27,791
[IMPEY]
Mm!

70
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:30,625
These sandwiches are great,
Cardia! They're delicious!

71
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:32,041
[CARDIA]
I'm glad.

72
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:34,250
I didn't do a very
good job making them.

73
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:36,083
[IMPEY]
No, they're amazing!

74
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:39,208
Oh, by the way, how's
the rebuild coming?

75
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:40,541
[sighs]

76
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:43,250
I've been trying a whole
slew of different things.

77
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:46,458
But sadly, there's still
not enough horsepower.

78
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:47,625
[chuckles]

79
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:49,541
Don't worry, Cardia,
I'll crack the code.

80
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:51,041
Remember, I'm the
genius inventor

81
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,000
who's gonna make it
to the moon one day!

82
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:55,041
[CARDIA]
You've said that before.

83
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:57,666
Do you mean <i>the</i> moon?

84
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:02,791
Yeah. That's the one!
It's always been my dream!

85
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:05,583
It all started with a
steam powered engine.

86
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:09,041
The first time I saw one?
I thought it was so thrilling!

87
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:13,291
Honestly, it was like my whole
world turned upside down!

88
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:17,250
I wanted to make
things like that, too!

89
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:22,000
Of course, it didn't work
out so well at first.

90
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:24,708
My master, or teacher, I guess,

91
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:27,875
told me something that
I'll never forget.

92
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:31,458
"Science is the power that
makes the impossible possible.

93
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:33,666
It's the dreams and
hopes of all people.

94
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:37,000
It can even take you
as far as the moon."

95
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:40,083
I was so excited.
I mean, it's the moon!

96
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:41,708
I figured, if I
could pull it off,

97
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:44,583
then anyone who saw me
would think it was amazing.

98
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:47,208
Just like I did as a kid!

99
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:49,083
And I've been trying ever since.

100
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:50,916
Trying to prove to
everyone that science

101
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,875
is the greatest hope we have.

102
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:55,333
Everybody makes fun
of me, of course.

103
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:57,625
They tell me that
it's ridiculous.

104
00:05:57,708 --> 00:06:00,291
But who cares? I'll succeed.

105
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:04,791
So you see? A little rebuild
like this is nothing!

106
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:07,875
I am going to win that airship
race no matter what, Cardia!

107
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:09,541
Just you wait and see!

108
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:19,166
[LUPIN]
Ugh. Impey, you imbecile!

109
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,375
[VAN]
The damned fool.

110
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:22,750
I already knew he
was absent-minded,

111
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:25,458
but this is beyond
my expectations.

112
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:28,333
[IMPEY] In Asia, this is the
most sincere form of apology.

113
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:29,708
The kneeling bow.

114
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:33,500
Uh, I'm sorry, but the
rebuild's not done yet!

115
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:35,875
The race is going to
start any minute now.

116
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:37,583
Do you think he'll
make it in time?

117
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:38,833
[SAINT chuckles]

118
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:42,375
Who can say? Punctuality
isn't his strong suit.

119
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:46,208
Saint, honestly, aren't
you at all concerned?

120
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:48,708
Impey.

121
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:51,041
Um, we mustn't give
up on him yet.

122
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:53,541
He'll be here soon.
I know he will.

123
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:57,625
[IMPEY]
Sorry for the wait!

124
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:00,083
The star of the show
is here, everyone!

125
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:04,125
That rascal. He sure does know
how to make an entrance.

126
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,083
[IMPEY chuckles]

127
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:10,458
It's like the saying goes,
"better late than never."

128
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:13,416
Didn't I tell you
I'd make it in time?

129
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,250
Yeah, yeah. Come on,
we've got work to do.

130
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:17,750
If you'd shown up any later,

131
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:19,875
I would've shot
you full of lead.

132
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:21,333
Aw, c'mon, you guys.

133
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:24,208
You could at least try to
have a little sympathy.

134
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:27,125
My. What a fabulous vessel!

135
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:30,208
That's a tremendous ship
you have there, my friend!

136
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:32,958
Ah! Why, thank you!
You understand my ship?

137
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:35,416
[NEMO]
Of course! It's magnificent!

138
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,291
I'm a genius scientist
who will one day

139
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:38,916
expose the truth of this world!

140
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,250
What's my name? Nemo!
And now you know.

141
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:44,958
Oh, okay.

142
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:46,833
Look, to be completely
honest here,

143
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:48,750
I don't really get you at all.

144
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:50,166
But, hey!

145
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,208
Just take a look at the
functional beauty of my airship!

146
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:54,250
She's just like a young
maiden, isn't she?

147
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:56,500
[NEMO]
Yes, that's it! Brilliant!

148
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:57,416
Like a bashful young girl...

149
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,000
What's his name? Nemo?

150
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:01,500
[FRAN]
Yes, Nemo.

151
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:02,666
You know him?

152
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:05,291
Well, not really.

153
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:08,500
I suppose you could
call us acquaintances?

154
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:11,666
We met many years ago,
in the Royal Society.

155
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,708
He thinks I'm his rival.

156
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:18,125
I see. You're saying
he's a nuisance. Got it.

157
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:19,708
Wonderful!

158
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,875
Surely it was fate that led me
to meet a brilliant scientist

159
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:23,833
in a place such as this!

160
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:25,583
Now, my very perceptive friend,

161
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:29,166
I'll give you a tour of my
prototype airship, <i>The Fulton</i> !

162
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,458
I am in! Wait, prototype?

163
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:32,958
[NEMO]
Yes!

164
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:35,250
One day, I will perfect my
craft and build the perfect...

165
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:37,250
Perfect. He's leaving with him.

166
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:39,291
It's okay.

167
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:43,250
I can get her off the ground
if you need me to.

168
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:45,666
Has everyone finished
their final checks?

169
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:48,500
Observation deck is all clear.

170
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:51,041
[VAN]
Main deck, all clear.

171
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:53,583
The engine room is clear, too.

172
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,000
Look at you!

173
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:57,583
I would say you were born
to be an airship captain.

174
00:08:57,666 --> 00:08:58,750
Welcome back.

175
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:00,708
Flight preparations
are complete, Impey.

176
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:02,458
We're all ready for take off.

177
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:04,166
[IMPEY]
All right, all right.

178
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:07,125
Look, I just got us
an aether transmitter.

179
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:10,375
So tell me, what did you
think of Nemo's ship?

180
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:13,625
[IMPEY]
Well, it was very impressive.

181
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:17,083
But, sadly for him, not
impressive enough to beat us.

182
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:18,583
[ANNOUNCER A]
Ladies and gentlemen!

183
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:21,375
The moment you've all been
waiting for is here at last!

184
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:22,750
Get ready

185
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:25,625
because the Black Gathering
race is about to begin!

186
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:27,916
Make sure that you win!

187
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:31,291
[IMPEY]
First we fly around the Thames.

188
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:33,000
Then we head to Big Ben.

189
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:35,291
Once we get there,
we turn and fly back.

190
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,666
If all goes as planned,
we'll be head of the pack!

191
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:38,958
We've got this.

192
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:40,875
Start us off at full
throttle, Fran!

193
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:43,750
We shoot straight up into the
sky until we reach altitude!

194
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,333
Roger that.

195
00:09:57,208 --> 00:10:00,375
[ANNOUNCER A]
Three! Two! One!

196
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:02,125
And we're off!

197
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:07,125
[ANNOUNCER A]
The race has officially begun!

198
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:09,416
There's a vessel
taking an early lead!

199
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,250
It looks like a rookie ship!

200
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:14,250
<i>The Impey, Princess,</i>
<i>and Manservant Express</i> !

201
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:15,750
[LUPIN]
Hey! That's not funny, Impey!

202
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:17,500
I am no one's manservant!

203
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,666
[IMPEY] Oh, come on, Lupin,
what's the matter?

204
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,458
You can't take a little joke?

205
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:23,208
[SAINT]
I can't really say I'm surprised

206
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:24,958
by your choice of names.

207
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,958
[ANNOUNCER A] Ehh. That name
is far too long, so for brevity,

208
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:30,083
I'll just call it <i>The Princess</i>
<i>and Manservant</i> .

209
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:32,375
What? He left out
the important part!

210
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:34,166
[chuckles]

211
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,500
Uh!

212
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:38,041
Ship approaching! Eight
o'clock! Brace for impact!

213
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:43,083
[ANNOUNCER A] <i>The Purple</i>
<i>Lightning Sky Pirate</i> attacks!

214
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:45,833
High in the sky,
an intense battle has begun!

215
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:48,291
Quick, Fran! Increase
our engine speed now!

216
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:49,916
[FRAN]
Roger that!

217
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:55,125
[IMPEY]
Now we're talking!

218
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:57,416
[VAN] Impey, we can't
launch a counter-attack.

219
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,125
We have no guns!

220
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:01,708
Yeah, I know. I got rid of
them to reduce our weight.

221
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:03,708
Besides, to flee
is to win, right?

222
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:08,083
Right. As long as we can
stay ahead of the pack.

223
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:10,916
We've got trouble, Impey!
The paint's flaking off!

224
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,083
We're winning.

225
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:13,791
Why should we care
about the stupid paint?

226
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:16,333
[LUPIN]
Because this isn't our ship!

227
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:19,041
[MAFIOSO A] Wait a second, does
that look familiar to anyone?

228
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:21,750
It's our emblem.
That ship is ours!

229
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:22,916
Oh, my!

230
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,250
This is a shocking
development to be sure!

231
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:27,166
It's been discovered that
<i>The Princess and Manservant</i>

232
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,250
is not <i>The Princess</i>
<i>and Manservant</i> at all!

233
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:31,541
The ship was stolen from
the Adele and Brutus Firm!

234
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:33,791
Word has it there's a cash
reward of 20 million

235
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:36,166
for whoever shoots it
out of the sky!

236
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,666
Let me get this straight.

237
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,250
Does that mean Lupin stole
this airship from the Mob?

238
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:41,916
This is not good news.

239
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,458
Lupin, next time
you steal something,

240
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:45,166
please don't take it
from the Mafia.

241
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,208
[LUPIN] Well, the cat's
out of the bag now.

242
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:49,166
More importantly,
they're behind us!

243
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,041
[IMPEY]
Huh?

244
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:53,291
Behind us? Great!

245
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:55,833
We've got to get away
from those ships and fast!

246
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,750
[LUPIN] They're prepared
to self-destruct.

247
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:01,375
They're so blinded
by the reward money

248
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:03,666
they've abandoned
the race entirely!

249
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:07,625
[ANNOUNCER A] <i>The Princess and</i>
<i>Manservant</i> is coming under fire!

250
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:08,458
[IMPEY yells]

251
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:10,125
[IMPEY]
Status report!

252
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:13,375
Lower armor is hit.
It doesn't look good.

253
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:15,500
Air pump 12 is out
of commission.

254
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:18,791
I'm expelling the ballast water
to regulate our buoyancy.

255
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:23,416
[ANNOUNCER A]
She's evading the attack.

256
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,750
<i>The Princess</i> is tenacious.
I'll give her that!

257
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:28,750
She's maneuvering away
from the artillery barrage!

258
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:31,791
[VAN]
We're surrounded.

259
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:35,000
I hate to say it, but escape
looks impossible.

260
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,625
[gasps]

261
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:46,125
Impey, look out!
Something's coming!

262
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:53,666
Look. They're helping us.

263
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,833
That guy? I don't think so.

264
00:12:55,916 --> 00:13:00,416
[NEMO] Impey Barbicane.
Your ship is truly fabulous!

265
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:05,583
However, I'm afraid I
cannot let you defeat me!

266
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,416
[NEMO] Impey Barbicane.
Your ship is truly fabulous!

However, I'm afraid I

Behold, my ingenious
technical prowess!

No ship can match the
might of my vessel!

[NEMO]
No one can escape <i>The Fulton</i> !

00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:45,500
Not even you, Barbicane!

273
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,375
Impey, look!

274
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:50,916
It's Big Ben!
Shake him off here!

275
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,500
Agh! Damn it!

276
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:55,333
Do it, Fran, crank the engine
up to the red zone right now!

277
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:57,916
Right, I'm on it! Here goes!

278
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:05,666
What?!

279
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:06,583
Yes!

280
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:08,375
[LUPIN]
Impey! Twelve o'clock!

281
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:11,250
You have got to be kidding me.

00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:11,916
[CARDIA gasps]

283
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,250
What? Oh, come on!

284
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:17,500
They knew they couldn't
catch us on the first leg,

285
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:20,625
so they set up an ambush
for the return trip!

286
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:27,083
[ANNOUNCER A] <i>The Princess</i>

[FRAN] Status update!
Engine 1 is fried!

290

Air pump's down.

00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,291
If we lose one more
pump, we're finished!

292
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:40,166
What are we supposed to do now?

293
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,750
We have to figure
something out fast!

294

[chuckles]

295
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:46,541
I had an inkling
this might happen!

00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:52,041
Impey, what is this?

297
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:53,333
[IMPEY]
Oh, it's nothing!

298

Just this ship's most
powerful secret weapon!

Here, Cardia.

300

Make preparations
for a counterattack.

00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:04,291
Right away.

302

What's the plan? Tell us
what needs to be done.

303
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:11,791
All right, it says here

304
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:14,208
that first we need to
put Van in the capsule.

305

Wait a second,

what is it you just said
you're gonna do to me?

Okay. We're all set.

Is this safe?

Hey!

00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:25,625
All right!

Take aim! Prepare to fire!

Three! Two! One!

Blast them to smithereens!

00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:43,333
But Van--

317
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:45,708
Right. Then we push.

318
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:58,708
[IMPEY] Van! Feel free to
shoot whatever you want!

[VAN]
Tch.

320
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:03,458
Impey, I'm gonna
make you regret this.

[ANNOUNCER A]
Wow! You'll never believe this!

322
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:29,000
One of <i>The Princess</i>
<i>and Manservant</i> 's crew

is taking over an

All by himself!

Impey, look! Nemo is back!

326
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,333
Roger that!

327
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,375
It appears <i>The Fulton</i>
has caught up

328
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:44,833
and resumed its vicious
attack on <i>The Princess</i> !

[NEMO]
You'll never get away from me!

[VAN] Anyone ever tell you
your laugh is excruciating?

334
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:20,458
Victory's ours. <i>The Fulton</i>
has been conquered.

335
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:25,666
Van!

[NEMO laughing]

337
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:35,333
[NEMO] It seems I have
lost this time around,

338
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:37,666
but I can promise you
that someday you and I

339
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:40,541
will once again face
each other in battle.

It blew up? But where's Van?

00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:52,333
[IMPEY] Relax, Fran.
He's on his way back now.

Yes, I'm fine.

Go back up. Impey needs you.

[CARDIA]
Uh. Right.

351
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,208
Impey, I'm going to
make you pay for that.

00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:11,250
[IMPEY]
I'm shaking in my boots!

You did really well down there.

Uh-oh!

starting to fall from the sky!

This is not good.

[DELACROIX gasps]

Well, Fran?

00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:28,708
[FRAN]
Um, I have some bad news.

362
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:31,208
I'm afraid the engine is
completely overheated.

363
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:32,583
So, uh...

364

Going down?

368
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:39,541
[ANNOUNCER A] Will they be able
to reach the finish line

369
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:40,791
before they crash?

370
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:43,083
They're in a ferocious
dead heat with death!

Hmph.

All right then!

00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:47,166
If a crash landing
is what's in store,

374
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,083
we might as well do it in style!

Impey.

00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:52,875
Trust me, Cardia,
we're going to win.

377
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:54,958
But the landing might
be a bit rough.

I'm not worried.

Impey always manages to
pull it off in the end.

That's true.

You liar. We almost
died up there!

We won, but we destroyed
the airship. Should we run?

The thing is, we
weren't favored to win.

The bookies made
a killing today.

Fortunately for us,
they're happy about that.

They're letting us off easy
this time. We were lucky.

Do you realize how incredibly
reckless that was?

But even so,

this brings us one step
closer to your dream.

Yes.

First thing we'll do is get rid
of that poison inside of you.
