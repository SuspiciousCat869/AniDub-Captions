00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:07,208
Idea's purpose is
to guide the people

164
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:09,583
towards that inevitability.

165
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:13,125
Yes. At least, that's
what you believe.

166
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:16,458
[GUINEVERE] Have we
anything else to believe?

167
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:18,583
If your compassion
compels you not to act,

168
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:20,291
you know what will happen next.

169
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:23,500
Thousands of innocent
people will die.

170
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:28,166
Deep down, I know you understand
the error in that path.

171
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:32,166
[SAINT]
Yes. I do understand.

172
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:35,791
Or at least I thought I did.

173
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:38,416
But the more time
we spend together,

174
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,500
the more comfortable I feel.

175
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:45,208
And the more severe
my doubt grows.

176
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:47,625
What a truly unpleasant role
I've been asked to play

177
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:50,083
in all of this.

178
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:54,458
I wonder, will this
be your salvation?

179
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:56,000
Cardia.

180
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:16,166
[SOLDIER J]
Where is the Queen?

181
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,750
[SOLDIER K]
Find her!

182
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:20,791
Fortunately for us,

183
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:23,208
it appears that they
haven't found her yet.

184
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:37,666
Cardia, you're not short
of breath, are you?

185
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,041
No, I'm all right.

186
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:42,208
Well, that's good. Seems
your training has paid off.

187
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:50,083
[VICTORIA]
If you want me, here I am.

188
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:51,208
[SOLDIER L]
Your Majesty!

189
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:53,166
[VICTORIA]
I've grown tired of running.

190
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:58,833
So tired.

191
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:03,458
[VICTORIA]
Oh, dear!

192
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:05,708
That vase was quite expensive.

193
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,375
[CARDIA]
You sound just like her.

194
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:08,333
[LUPIN chuckles]

195
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:09,166
I know.

196
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,875
[static]

197
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:12,916
[SOLDIER N] Engaging the
rebels outside the library!

198
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,250
Requesting immediate back up!

199
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:20,083
This entire fiasco,

200
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:22,291
from the revolt to the
attack on the palace...

201
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:25,333
I have to admit, our
enemies are impressive.

202
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:26,541
Finis is going to pay

203
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:29,875
for all the innocent
lives we've lost today.

204
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,625
[LEONHARDT]
Stay strong, Your Majesty.

205
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:33,041
The best way to
punish these animals

206
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:35,291
is to make sure you
survive their attack!

207
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:38,500
Yes. You're right, Captain!

208
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:39,375
[BOTH gasp]

209
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:41,958
Stay back. Let me handle this!

210
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:43,375
[VICTORIA]
Leonhardt.

211
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:52,541
That was a close one, Old Timer.

212
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:56,250
Greetings, My Queen.

213
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:58,708
Have no fear,
the cavalry has arrived.

214
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:02,208
Arséne Lupin, the Gentleman
Thief, at your service.

215
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:05,250
I have ventured to the palace
to abscond with you.

216
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:08,666
[VICTORIA] Abscond with me?
I don't understand.

217
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:11,500
I'm afraid I don't have time
to explain in great detail.

218
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:15,041
Cardia, is the coast clear now?

219
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:17,541
Yes, but we need
to move quickly!

220
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:25,958
[LUPIN]
We're here for one reason.

221
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:28,333
To stop this rebellion
while there's still time.

222
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:31,416
We can get you out of here
in one piece, Your Majesty.

223
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,125
But I need you to trust me.

224
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:37,208
I have more than a few
questions, Mr. Lupin.

225
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,291
But for the time being, perhaps
it's best we make our escape.

226
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:44,875
[chuckles] I think
that's very wise.

227
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:51,708
The signal! Let's go!

228
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:54,666
Sorry about this!

229
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:05,625
Go on without me! I'll hold
them off as long as I can!

230
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:06,458
You ready?

231
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:07,791
Let's move!

232
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:10,708
[LEONHARDT]
What's this passage?

233
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:13,625
[LUPIN] It was used as
an escape route long ago.

234
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:15,833
It's no surprise you
don't know about it.

235
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:18,083
How the hell do you know then?

236
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:21,208
How? Because I'm
the Gentleman Thief.

237
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:25,166
Is it rusted shut?

238
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:28,000
No. But it's been
here a long time.

239
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:30,166
This might call for
a bit of gunpowder.

240
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,458
[LEONHARDT]
Gunpowder?

241
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:33,041
I'm not sure that's safe.

242
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:34,291
[CARDIA]
Wait.

243
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:39,250
[gasps]

244
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:43,333
Thought I'd save us some time.

245
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:44,416
Good thinking.

246
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,750
[VICTORIA chuckles]

247
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:48,125
[VICTORIA]
The infamous poison, I see.

248
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:51,666
Which means you must be
the one they call Cardia.

249
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:55,500
Your reputation
precedes you, my dear.

250
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:57,583
If we happen to make
it out of here alive,

251
00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:59,708
I think you and I should
have a little chat.

252
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:02,041
How does that sound?

253
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:04,375
I'll keep it in mind.

254
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:12,041
[CARDIA]
It's so quiet out here.

255
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:14,166
[LUPIN] We're rather far
from the palace now.

256
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:17,208
Once we cross this bridge,
we should be safe.

257
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,833
[ALL gasp]

258
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:22,041
Did you really think
I'd let you get away?

259
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:23,583
I'm thrilled to
see you on the day

260
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:27,291
our plan is set in
motion, dear Sister.

261
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:29,041
Finis.

262
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:36,208
What is he doing here?

263
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:37,541
[chuckles]

264
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:39,500
You're not the only one
who's a world-class expert

265
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:43,333
at outsmarting
people, Mr. Lupin.

266
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:47,708
Sister, did you enjoy
the gift I gave you?

267
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:49,250
Tell me.

268
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:53,708
How did it feel to learn the
truth about what you really are?

269
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:57,208
You are indeed a monster, and
I don't mean that figuratively.

270
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:59,833
Not only does poison flow
through your entire body,

271
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:01,666
you're not even a human being.

272
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:02,791
[chuckles]

273
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:04,375
Were you surprised?

274
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:06,416
Please, tell me everything.

275
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,500
[laughs]

276
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:12,208
I'm not a monster.

277
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:14,083
Huh?

278
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:16,083
[CARDIA]
I'm not.

279
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:19,666
You are wrong!
I am not a monster!

280
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:26,250
[FINIS]
Ah! Your friends, of course.

281
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:29,291
They're the ones who put
this idea in your head.

282
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:31,208
I don't like them one bit.

283
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:34,625
I want you to tell me
everything about Code: Realize.

284
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:35,625
[FINIS laughs]

285
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:37,541
It would be my pleasure.

286
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:40,083
Code: Realize is the
gloriously perfect plan

287
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:43,291
our father concocted
many years ago.

288
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:45,000
It's goal is simple.

289
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:48,500
To reduce England and the rest
of the world to a pile of dust!

290
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:49,416
[VICTORIA gasps]

291
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,041
Are you out of your mind?!

292
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:52,875
I will not let you do this!

293
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:54,291
[FINIS laughs]

294
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:57,416
You're so brave! But you don't
know what you're saying!

295
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,875
Don't you understand?

296
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:02,333
You're going to help me make
father's dream a reality.

297
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:04,541
Let me tell you a little secret.

298
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:07,000
When you and I, the
Horologium and the vessel,

299
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:08,583
join together as one,

300
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:10,250
the world will
finally understand

301
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:12,458
the true immensity of
our father's plan.

302
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:15,833
We were created to be the
means to his masterful ends.

303
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:18,583
Father's Code: Realize stretches
further and goes deeper

304
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:20,541
than a mere coup d'état.

305
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:22,083
London is just the start.

306
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:25,000
The beginning of the end
for everyone in this world.

307
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:28,083
You saw it on your way here,
didn't you, Sister?

308
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:32,875
The destroyed cityscape.
Bodies strewn about everywhere.

309
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:35,708
We will watch with pleasure
as the world cowers in fear

310
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:38,833
in the face of its
inevitable destruction!

311
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:41,500
[FINIS laughs]

312
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:42,833
Oh, look at you!

313
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:44,458
Do you really think
covering your eyes and ears

314
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:45,833
will change anything?

315
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:48,333
[laughs]

316
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:49,625
Oh, relax.

317
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:52,416
Your will has no bearing
in these proceedings!

318
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,875
After all, your very existence
destroys every single thing

319
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:57,333
in its path, does it not?

320
00:17:57,416 --> 00:17:58,125
[FINIS laughs]

321
00:17:58,208 --> 00:17:59,583
Just leave her alone!

322
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:01,083
Don't you see?

323
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:03,500
You're the one who's going
to destroy the world, Sister.

324
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:04,916
It's your fate!

325
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,458
It's the sole purpose you
were designed to fulfill.

326
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:09,625
[chuckles]

327
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:11,875
Everyone is going to
die because of you.

328
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:14,583
Everyone! Even your friends!

329
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:17,250
I told you to leave her alone!

330
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:19,083
[FINIS]
You're too loud, Mr. Lupin.

331
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:20,333
[gunshot]

332
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:25,541
Lupin!

333
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:29,416
See? You're to blame
for his demise as well.

334
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:33,666
Take my sister away.

335
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:43,541
[IMPEY]
We're here!

336
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:45,875
Your knights in shining
armor have arrived!

337
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,041
We've come to save
the day, Cardia!

338
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:49,833
It's Impey.

339
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:51,666
Who else would it be?

340
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:54,041
--[thudding]
--[yelling]

341
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:00,041
Van!

342
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:03,000
Thank you. Let's
get out of here.

343
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:05,333
Majesty. Forgive me.

344
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,833
Jump! Hurry!

345
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:23,791
[FINIS]
Bring her back.

346
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:26,708
My sister has a very
important part to play.

347
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:29,791
Every last one of them will die.

348
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:32,291
And it's all because of her!

349
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:37,416
[CARDIA] Mountains of rubble
spilling all over the city.

350
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:41,083
Motionless bodies.
Pools of blood.

351
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:44,666
[CARDIA] Is it really
my fate to bring about

352
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:47,625
such fear and devastation?

353
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:52,666
If indeed that's true,
what does that make me?

354
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:30,333
[VICTORIA]
So we're clear,

355
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:32,708
you're saying this horrific
coup d'état was perpetrated

356
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:36,125
in service of fulfilling
Isaac Beckford's plan, yes?

357
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:39,166
Yes. That's why we're headed
to St Paul's Cathedral.

358
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:42,375
To meet Finis head on and
put a stop to him for good.

359
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:45,583
But we need your help.
Round up all of your men.

360
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:48,958
We'll use them to drive the
rebels out of St Paul's.

361
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:53,833
I've already lost so
many of my soldiers.

362
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:56,500
That said...

363
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:59,791
The British Army
will stand with you.

364
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:01,416
We've no choice.

365
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,375
If I let them seize
control of London,

366
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:05,541
it won't be long before
the entire Empire

367
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:07,541
crumbles beneath my feet.

368
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:11,416
Did we just form a united
front? Or am I mistaken?

369
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:14,958
A royal Queen and a gang of
thieves banding together as one?

370
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:15,958
[VICTORIA chuckles]

371
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:17,833
What strange times.

372
00:22:17,916 --> 00:22:19,583
You have my word, Lupin.

373
00:22:19,666 --> 00:22:22,125
I'll make sure Finis
pays for his crimes.

374
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:25,958
He'll rue the day he raised
his sword to the royal crown.

375
00:22:29,208 --> 00:22:30,500
[SAINT]
Cardia.

376
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:33,083
[CARDIA]
Saint.

377
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:35,041
How did you know I was here?

378
00:22:35,125 --> 00:22:38,583
Haven't you figured it
out yet? I know everything.

379
00:22:38,666 --> 00:22:39,958
[chuckles]

380
00:22:42,875 --> 00:22:45,875
What's wrong, Cardia?
You seem sad.

381
00:22:45,958 --> 00:22:47,333
I can hardly blame you,

382
00:22:47,416 --> 00:22:50,750
not after you've learned so
much in such a short time.

383
00:22:50,833 --> 00:22:53,583
However, there's
nothing to fear.

384
00:22:53,666 --> 00:22:56,000
In your journey to
uncover the truth,

385
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:59,083
take comfort in knowing
you won't be alone.

386
00:22:59,166 --> 00:23:01,583
You have many friends
on whom you can depend.

387
00:23:01,666 --> 00:23:03,541
Friends you can trust.

388
00:23:03,625 --> 00:23:06,708
Friends who will be there for
you no matter the circumstances.

389
00:23:06,791 --> 00:23:08,250
Saint?

390
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:12,875
[SAINT] I... I'm sure
I love you, Cardia, truly.

391
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:15,250
I'm sure I love the
others, as well.

392
00:23:15,333 --> 00:23:17,791
I want to see the answer
you find for yourselves.

393
00:23:17,875 --> 00:23:20,333
I want that more than anything.

394
00:23:20,416 --> 00:23:21,708
"I'm sure."

395
00:23:21,791 --> 00:23:25,833
I imagine to you that
phrase sounds rather silly.

396
00:23:25,916 --> 00:23:27,916
I imagine it's hard
to comprehend.

397
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,041
Not even understanding
your own feelings.

398
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:35,000
[SAINT]
I am a disciple of Idea.

399
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:37,250
I have a destiny I must fulfill.

400
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:38,750
Idea?

401
00:23:38,833 --> 00:23:42,291
Cardia, my dear,
I'm here for one reason.

402
00:23:42,375 --> 00:23:44,833
I have come here to kill you.

403
00:23:44,916 --> 00:23:46,291
[gasps]
