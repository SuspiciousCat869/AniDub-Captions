Soon, Sister.

We will become one as
we were meant to be.

I can't help but wonder,

11
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:54,500
will my father
finally look at me?

12

Will he...? Will he love me?

It's quiet.

Yes. The diversionary force
has Twilight distracted.

00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:11,666
[IMPEY] Does anyone have a clue
what we're looking at here?

163
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,708
[LUPIN]
Some kind of celestial globe.

164
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:18,958
[CARDIA]
Lupin, is this Father's secret?

165
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:21,458
Do you think this thing
is Code: Realize?

166
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:23,708
[FINIS laughs]

167
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:25,916
[FINIS]
No, not quite.

168
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,625
I'm pleased you
finally found me, Sister.

169
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:32,208
Welcome to the
beginning of the end.

170
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:33,833
[You bastard.

171
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:36,666
[FINIS] To be honest,
I hoped you would come alone.

172
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,416
But it seems you've brought
some interferences.

173
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,291
Well, a lady deserves
an escort, right?

174
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:43,541
[chuckles]

175
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:45,708
Even after everything,
you still speak to me

176
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:48,458
with such flippant
impudence in your voice.

177
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:50,750
I almost admire you.

178
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:53,333
It appears the major powers
have already caught wind

179
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:56,166
of the violent civil
war raging above us.

180
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,500
If they invade, the
Mighty British Empire

181
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:00,333
will crumble at last.

182
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:01,958
So that's what you're after.

183
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:03,333
I have some bad news.

184
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,291
We've got an iron-willed
Queen on our side

185
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:06,916
who will never surrender.

186
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,916
You're going to fail, Finis.

187
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:20,708
[click]

188
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:22,083
You're out of time.

189
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:25,000
Tell us every last detail
you know right now!

190
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:26,916
[chuckles]

191
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,166
[FINIS]
Every last detail?

192
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,000
Well, let's see...

193
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:34,666
Would you be interested to
know how your family died?

194
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:37,166
Yes, I can even
show you the reports

195
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,916
if you'd care to peruse them,

196
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,083
I'm confident everything
you ever wanted to know

197
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:43,500
is written there in
exquisite detail.

198
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:45,041
Aww.

199
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:47,500
Did you really come all this
way just to learn about that?

200
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:48,416
So sad.

201
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,416
[VAN]
Shut up.

202
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,750
That's not why!

203
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:54,000
No. Not why at all!

204
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,541
Yes!

205
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:57,833
You came here because you want
to put a bullet in my head!

206
00:13:57,916 --> 00:14:02,375
[laughing]

207
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:04,250
Shut your mouth, Finis.

208
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:05,791
Or I'll shut it for you!

209
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:09,875
[CARDIA gasping]

210
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:11,333
[FINIS chuckles]

211
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:15,666
[sneers]

212
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:18,458
Cardia!

213
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:20,125
I'm okay.

214
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:24,833
[growls]

215
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:27,500
[FINIS]
Don't touch my sister!

216
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,875
[thud]

217
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,166
Saint. You...

218
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:41,750
No. Impossible.

219
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:46,083
I'm sorry, Van.
I didn't have a choice.

220
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:00,708
Finis... He's dead.

221
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:04,666
I just... I never thought
it would end like this.

222
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:08,125
[VAN]
That's it? It's over?

223
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:13,916
You bastard. So this is
how you die in the end?

224
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,166
You deserve worse.

225
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:19,250
So much worse.
You deserve to rot in hell.

226
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:20,583
[FINIS]
Relax.

227
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:23,708
I'll let you kill me too,
if you'd like, Helsing.

228
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:27,916
What is happening?

229
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,666
[FINIS]
If my sister is a monster,

230
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:33,250
doesn't it stand to reason
her dear little brother

231
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:36,041
would be a monster, too?

232
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:38,208
Do you want the truth?

233
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:41,875
Fine, I'll show you.
Open your eyes.

234
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:44,000
It's all around you.

235
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:47,166
[FINIS laughs]

236
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,500
[FINIS]
Are you shocked?

237
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:50,791
You see, my friends, the
figures you see before you

238
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:53,500
are all merely puppets.

239
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:57,500
The real me is right here.

240
00:15:57,583 --> 00:16:00,708
[CARDIA]
Father's device is Finis?

241
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:04,291
[FINIS]
Yes. And it's not me alone.

242
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:09,000
It is our father, Isaac
Beckford, as well.

243
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:11,583
Our human father passed away,

244
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:15,208
but he was reborn as this
powerful mechanical vessel.

245
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:18,500
At the moment, he's sleeping.

246
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:20,250
Father? It can't be.

247
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:21,625
[FINIS laughs]

248
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:24,375
[FINIS] What reason is there
to grieve, dear Sister.

249
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:27,500
In death, our father,
the unrivaled genius scientist,

250
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:30,041
gained an immortal body.

251
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:33,083
Well, of course your
companions won't understand.

252
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:35,583
They're just ordinary
people, after all.

253
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:37,333
He's a mad man.

254
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,583
[laughs]

255
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:44,583
[FINIS] My sister and I,
the keys to the plan,

256
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:47,166
have been united at last.

257
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:52,125
My sister's heart, the
perpetual motion Horologium.

258
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:54,416
When it fuses with my body,

259
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:58,041
a god will be born
into this world.

260
00:16:58,125 --> 00:16:59,708
A mechanical god surpassing

261
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:02,791
all human knowledge
and comprehension!

262
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:04,458
Tell me why.

263
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:06,500
You wanna make a god,
then go make one.

264
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:08,958
But why go to such
lengths to start a war?

265
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:10,583
[FINIS laughs]

266
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:12,083
[FINIS]
You don't understand.

267
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:15,958
Consider for a moment the entire
course of human history.

268
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:19,291
In times of war, mankind has
invented innumerable things

269
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:22,708
and made many scientific
advancements.

270
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,916
War is what propels
your species forward.

271
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,375
It's the one thing that
keeps humanity evolving.

272
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:29,916
In a war that has no end,

273
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,583
the capacity for human
kind to evolve is infinite!

274
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:34,958
Do you see now?

275
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:37,916
This is the singular
purpose of Code: Realize!

276
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,291
Our father is going to
reconstruct this failing world

277
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:41,583
from the ground up!

278
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:42,791
[BOTH gasp]

279
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:51,416
[FINIS] You'll be coming
with me, Sister.

280
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:55,416
Let us join together and carry
out our father's greatest wish.

281
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,666
You won't succeed. We'll
make sure of that, Finis!

282
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:01,083
If you want her, you'll
have to get through us.

283
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:04,708
[FINIS]
Come along, Sister. It's time.

284
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:09,083
Let us become part of the god in
which our father will be reborn.

285
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:13,875
Oh, no.

286
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:16,083
[FINIS]
What are you doing, Van?

287
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:20,458
[FINIS] Shouldn't you be
trying to protect my sister?

288
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:22,041
How cold of you!

289
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:29,875
You've always been my goal.
It's time to finish this!

290
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:32,583
If you kill me,

291
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:34,833
you'll never be able to get rid
of the poison inside Cardia.

292
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:35,958
[gasps]

293
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:43,125
Van!

294
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:44,750
[rumbling]

295
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:50,791
[laughing]

296
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:58,875
[LUPIN]
What's going on?

297
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,208
Gravity has reversed.

298
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:05,833
You're kidding!

299
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:08,666
Out! Let's go!

300
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:18,291
Oh, no.

301
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:20,166
This can't be real.

302
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:24,333
[NEMO] Magnificent!
It is truly magnificent!

303
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:28,541
History will remember this as
my greatest achievement by far!

304
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:34,125
The giant, unsinkable air
battleship: <i>The Nautilus</i> !

305
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:36,708
Nemo. Did he say "Nautilus"?

306
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:38,708
[FRAN]
Remember Isaac's notes?

307
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:45,333
Cardia!

308
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:47,083
Let me go!

309
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:50,333
[FINIS] Don't worry,
it will all be over soon.

310
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:56,166
[FINIS] The moment of our
reward is at hand, Sister.

311
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,708
Cardia!

312
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:03,041
Cardia!

313
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:04,208
Grab my hand!

314
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:05,916
Lupin!

315
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,458
[FINIS]
That won't do.

316
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:22,916
Lupin!

317
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,708
My sister belongs to me now.

318
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:28,708
I won't let anyone have her.

319
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:31,791
We're going to merge
into a single being.

320
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:37,125
And then, at last,
Father will finally love me.

321
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,000
Cardia.

322
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:47,833
I'll never stop
fighting for you!

323
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:52,083
I swear! I won't rest until
I've stolen you back!

324
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:55,833
Trust me. This isn't over!

325
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:58,875
I know, Lupin.

326
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:04,583
[CARDIA] We have to keep
fighting. No matter what!

327
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:09,125
[BOTH gasp]

328
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:27,458
[CARDIA] A fog of death
cloaks the earth's surface.

329
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:31,333
The world groans beneath
its malevolent terror.

330
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:39,250
[CARDIA] The dream I thought
was right before me, my wish,

331
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:41,750
it's gone from my sight now.

332
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:46,500
[CARDIA] The flames of
war burn without end,

333
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:49,125
just as the god wishes,

334
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:52,208
until this world
is turned to ash.

335
00:23:33,583 --> 00:23:34,541
[gasps]
