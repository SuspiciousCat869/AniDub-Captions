[VAN]
Dumb question.

After facing the reality
of what she truly is,

12
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:18,166
she's probably very confused.

There's a possibility that was

All of Isaac's

Now who would do that?

It has to be Finis, right?

Yes, of course.

Does he just wanna
hurt Cardia?

Cardia was a homunculus.

The fact that she's Isaac

Taking all those facts together,

Cardia didn't deserve

39
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:27,083
in such a horrific way.

She trusted him and he thanked
her by keeping her in the dark.

You should all be ashamed.

The truth is, I am a monster.

00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,666
Elaine trusted me.

Yet here I am.

Someone like me doesn't

Take this, Lupin.

I'm not worthy of it.

Listen, Cardia. There's
something I want you to hear.

213
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,708
I've never told you my story,

214
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:20,708
or the reason I wanna
stop Isaac's plan

no matter what it takes.

216
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:25,500
It's because of something
my teacher said.

217
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:28,125
Your teacher?

218
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:29,666
Yes.

219
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,875
"In order to deliver justice,

and give the spoils
to those in need."

That's the brand of morality
he instilled in me, but...

223
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,125
I sensed that something
was eating away

224
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:46,125
at my teacher's soul.

225
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:52,041
You know why I became
a chivalrous thief, Lupin?

00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:54,291
To atone for my sin.

convictions no matter what,

even if it means your death.

229
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,916
It's what I failed to do.

230
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:09,291
[LUPIN] At the time, I didn't
know what he was talking about.

he meant by his sin.

But it destroyed him.

It was more than enough
to drive him mad.

234
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:24,333
After that, I decided
to set things right.

[LUPIN] After he died,
I learned the whole truth.

The truth about his "sin."

244
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:59,958
Turns out he knew about
Isaac's terrorist plot,

245
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:02,875
but instead of coming
forward, he ran away.

I'm so sorry, Lupin.

here to London.

erase, just like you.

I'll never abandon you,

deny that's true.

At first, the Horologium and
your connection to Isaac

were my primary motivations

But then, that night....

I did it because I couldn't
bear to leave you alone.

But why?

00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:11,125
I can never forgive you for
what happened to my mom,

but still, I don't think you're
evil like they say you are.

And neither did my mom.

She cared about you.

Cardia. You're not a monster.

[CARDIA] That idea has

but hearing her say that made
it thaw just a little bit.

I have destroyed many things.

And even though I didn't
do it on purpose,

295
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,708
I know that I can
never be forgiven.

296
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:43,958
I still believe that.

But even so...

I found this hidden in my room.

This is Fran's department.

It's very important to me.

322
00:22:42,416 --> 00:22:44,250
What a coincidence.

323
00:22:49,833 --> 00:22:52,291
[LUPIN]
I know it, too.

324
00:22:52,375 --> 00:22:53,833
That term?

325
00:22:53,916 --> 00:22:56,958
It's the code name for Isaac's
clandestine terrorist plot.

326
00:22:57,041 --> 00:22:59,791
Cardia. That must
mean their base is...

327
00:22:59,875 --> 00:23:01,958
...under St. Paul's Cathedral.

328
00:23:02,041 --> 00:23:04,000
Is my father there, too?

329
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:05,041
[CARDIA gasps]

330
00:23:14,166 --> 00:23:15,958
It's burning.

331
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,000
[FINIS]
Now,

332
00:23:32,083 --> 00:23:35,583
let us finally begin the task
of creating of our new world.

333
00:23:35,666 --> 00:23:38,500
I hope you're watching,
dear Father.
