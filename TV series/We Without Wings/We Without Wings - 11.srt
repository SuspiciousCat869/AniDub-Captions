1
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:26,958
Holy sword Gretacalibur,
limit unlock now!

2
00:00:27,041 --> 00:00:30,875
True holy sword
Gretahyper, activate!

3
00:00:30,958 --> 00:00:33,333
Not a single enemy will
attack this fair kingdom,

4
00:00:33,416 --> 00:00:35,500
I will not allow it!

5
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:38,208
Come to my aid,
radiance of the stars!

6
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:43,291
It's amazing watching
Lord Hawk in battle!

7
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:47,250
It is; our lord doth strike
the most gallant of images.

8
00:00:56,625 --> 00:01:00,333
Super combination! Honey
Sweet Knight Rendezvous!

9
00:01:03,625 --> 00:01:05,125
It's truly amazing!

10
00:01:05,208 --> 00:01:07,625
A miraculous union
of love that only a princess

11
00:01:07,708 --> 00:01:09,958
and holy knight can perform!

12
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,041
Neither the
impregnable Zwei Fortress

13
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:21,333
or Princess Asuka's heart
ever stood a chance

14
00:01:21,416 --> 00:01:22,875
against Sir Hawk.

15
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:25,291
I cannot compete,
in love or in battle.

16
00:01:25,375 --> 00:01:28,541
There is nothing
but to accept my fate.

17
00:01:28,625 --> 00:01:32,708
Lord Hawk! Lord Hawk!

18
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:22,291
Good morning.

19
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:25,708
Thank you for the alarm clock.

20
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:28,000
Huh? No problem!

21
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:32,583
And thanks for breakfast.

22
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:37,000
Hey, this toast
is surprisingly good plain!

23
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:39,291
I don't even think
it needs any spread on it!

24
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,916
Oh, thanks.

25
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:47,750
I didn't mean
for that to happen.

26
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:49,666
You're so thoughtful!

27
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,875
Kobato and I just
don't seem to mesh.

28
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:58,291
Still, what's going on?
I feel good for the first time

29
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:00,000
in a long time.

30
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:02,916
Morning, Shunosuke,
ya no-good poser.

31
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:07,458
Hold on. Takashi?!

32
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:09,583
Good morning to you too, Asuka.

33
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,250
Good to see you.

34
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:16,958
I'm sorry about
what happened yesterday.

35
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:19,041
I wanted to go shopping with
you, but we had to figure out

36
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:22,500
the graduation essays.
Hope you weren't too upset.

37
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:26,083
Yesterday? Oh, right,
that was no big deal.

38
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:29,291
Hmm, so he doesn't
retain his memories.

39
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:32,625
Ahh, don't worry about it. I'm
pretty sure Masako picked up

40
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:35,000
the slack and divided up
the essays already.

41
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:38,625
Really? Great. Remind me
to thank her for that later on.

42
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:40,208
Nah, that's not necessary.

43
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:42,750
She's the vice-president,
after all; it's her job.

44
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:46,000
Ah, there you are.

45
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:49,458
Oh. Good morning.
Why're you in here?

46
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:54,125
Oh, Just a timely coincidence,
I guess. I thought I would

47
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:56,625
pop in to pay you a little
visit, so now here I am.

48
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:57,791
Oh? What'd you
want to talk about?

49
00:04:57,875 --> 00:04:59,750
An upperclassman?

50
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:03,666
Does the concept of "little
sister moé" ring a bell?

51
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,250
That question's
pretty out of the blue.

52
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:08,625
Rumor has it that
cocky prick chicken knows

53
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:10,708
quite a bit about the concept.

54
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,000
It's not a big deal, but
I don't like the thought

55
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:19,583
of not knowing as much
about a topic as he does,

56
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:23,916
if you catch my drift. I just
hoped you could enlighten me.

57
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,750
All right. But I'll give
you a fair warning,

58
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:29,875
little sister moé is not
something to be taken lightly.

59
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:32,416
That makes it
all the more interesting.

60
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,958
You've given me every reason
I need to sit back and listen.

61
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:36,833
Now then, lay it on me.

62
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:43,791
"Little sister moé encompasses
a wide range of infatuation.

63
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:46,125
Sister-in-law,
best friend's sister,

64
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:48,875
younger childhood friend,
even an underclassman

65
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:50,500
who acts just like a sister.

66
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:52,000
What about the
seemingly helpless,

67
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:54,291
sister-esque older woman?
And, of course,

68
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:56,583
we shouldn't forget the
cute cross-dressing brother.

69
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:59,833
Hold it, none of these types
are actual little sisters.

70
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:03,541
That's right. For loving
one's own sister is

71
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:06,000
the most forbidden little
sister moé of them all.

72
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:08,416
I'm not one to pass judgment
on other people's tastes,

73
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,583
but in my humble opinion,
there is no moé that

74
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:13,000
would involve the infatuation
of one's own sibling.

75
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:14,666
It's the "tabooest" of taboos.

76
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,125
Ah. I take it you have
a few siblings too, Miyako?

77
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:19,000
Yes. But how
did you know that?

78
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:20,833
In the worlds
of gaming and anime,

79
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:23,708
whenever a sister character
is also an actual sister,

80
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:25,458
it seems to mirror reality.

81
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:27,666
Lost individuals who would
create such fabrications

82
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:30,041
may do so out of
a loving bond or attachment.

83
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:32,041
But instead, their actions
are perceived as creepy

84
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,250
and weird by the very
object of their affection.

85
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:38,625
Consider yourself lucky if you
never meet such disturbed souls.

86
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:40,875
I read somewhere that
sharks attack their siblings

87
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:42,458
when they emerge
from the womb.

88
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:45,500
So perhaps hating one's flesh
and blood is a primal instinct.

89
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:48,625
Funny, the bonds that
tie us together-Hey,

90
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:49,458
this is pretty fun!

91
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:51,000
What the hell.

92
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,625
Haneda!

93
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,416
Oh, hi, Masako.

94
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,375
So teacher gave us the green
light on the graduation essays,

95
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:03,291
said to go ahead and
move forward with them!

96
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:05,541
Wow, talk about
a load off our shoulders!

97
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:06,541
Great job with that!

98
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:07,958
Nah, it was nothing!

99
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:10,958
I mean you were the real
brains of the operation.

100
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:12,041
Hey Takashi!

101
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:13,791
You wanna grab
a soda with me?

102
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:15,541
Oh, all right.

103
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:19,083
Guess I better head out
of here, one more thing.

104
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:23,541
About yesterday. You were pretty
damn amazing, that's all.

105
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:26,916
Okay, that was kinda weird, huh?

106
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,250
Sure was.

107
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:30,000
Wait, I thought we were
gonna go grab some sodas?

108
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,333
Forget it.

109
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:44,583
Hey, Takashi.

110
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:46,833
Would you like
to walk home together?

111
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:53,083
Uh, hey.

112
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:54,916
That you, Shusuke?

113
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,458
What are you doing
walking around

114
00:07:56,541 --> 00:08:00,875
in that ridiculous uniform?
Trying to pick up schoolgirls?

115
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:02,666
You youngsters might
have bright futures,

116
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,666
but you really need
to learn how to dress.

117
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,208
You should at least
change clothes before

118
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:08,916
you go anywhere else today.
They're called school uniforms

119
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,375
for a reason:
you wear them at school.

120
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:12,583
I swear

121
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:14,458
Keep making weird
decisions and the world

122
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:16,500
will just continue
giving you more stupid crap

123
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:19,416
to worry about. Where'd he go?

124
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:23,583
That lady back there,
she seemed to-

125
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:27,666
So what, are you interested
in that woman or something?

126
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:31,041
Huh? No, no, don't
be silly. Come on.

127
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:33,916
You're the only girl
that I want to be with!

128
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,166
How about we just
keep moving then, okay?

129
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,166
So where is this shop
we're looking for?

130
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:43,416
Oh, well, um,
it's uhhhh, ahh,

131
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,666
it's right over there,
the pink food truck!

132
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:48,458
All right, do you know
what you want? My treat!

133
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:51,083
Anything that's
as sweet as you are!

134
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,708
Honey and cucumber?

135
00:08:57,791 --> 00:08:59,916
Not tasty.

136
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,458
The crepe has a look
that's funny, I think.

137
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:03,625
Why is that?

138
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:05,833
It doesn't belong
because it's different,

139
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:09,208
it is like how you are
different today too, Drac.

140
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:11,500
Who's to say who does
and doesn't belong anywhere?

141
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:13,041
That's quite a statement,
little girl!

142
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:16,250
Not right. Mr. Drac's
speaking very not right.

143
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:17,333
Who's Mr. Drac?

144
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:18,708
With that funky outfit
you're wearing,

145
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:20,875
someone's gonna think
that you're respectable!

146
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:22,791
What happened to being
Mr. Mean ol' Tough Guy

147
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:24,333
around the block?

148
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:26,500
Shift gears like this and the
world might come to an end!

149
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:28,416
Drac, are you feeling ok?

150
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,208
Drac isn't Drac!
He's too dumb.

151
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:33,875
S-sorry, but who's this
Drac guy? W-whoa!

152
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:35,458
Actually I'm in the
mood for some soup!

153
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,125
Soup noodles!

154
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:46,791
I must have a lot of
doppelgangers in this city.

155
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:49,000
Kinda weird,
don't cha think?

156
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:50,625
I read somewhere that
everyone has at least

157
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:52,875
three lookalikes
scattered on the planet.

158
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:54,625
What are the chances that
I'd be in the same city

159
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:56,250
as one of them?!

160
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:57,833
You're still not getting it.

161
00:09:57,916 --> 00:09:58,541
Huh?

162
00:09:58,625 --> 00:09:59,875
Never mind.

163
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:01,916
I didn't realize that
it was so late.

164
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,375
Yeah, guess so.

165
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:05,416
So for now I gotta take off,

166
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,666
but you and I really
should hang out more often.

167
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:08,625
I'd like that.

168
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:09,875
See ya!

169
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:20,375
Hey! Hold on!

170
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:26,500
Well, uh. Can you
come over for a bit?

171
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:28,208
It shouldn't take long.

172
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:33,125
Geez, do you have
to touch everything?

173
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:36,208
Oh, sorry, when will
your parents be home?

174
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:39,041
Didn't I tell you?
I live alone.

175
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:42,583
Ah, right, so why'd
you want me to come over?

176
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:46,791
Well, for starters...

177
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:51,083
I'd like to hear
more about Gretagard.

178
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:53,791
I'm sorry, but how is it
you know about that?

179
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:55,500
It's something you mentioned
the other day when you

180
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:59,583
got dizzy after Masako was
throwing that fit, remember?

181
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:02,916
Drink some tea.

182
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,250
Oh, thank you. I forgot
that you heard me babbling.

183
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,875
Don't worry, it's just
between you and me.

184
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:13,250
Mmm, all right.
I honestly was never going

185
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:15,291
to bring it up with you,
but since you already know

186
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:19,416
about it, I might
as well come clean.

187
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,458
The truth is I'm
a man from another realm.

188
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:32,958
Lemme get this straight,
so you're a knight

189
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:35,541
in shining armor,
and I'm a damsel in distress.

190
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:39,958
No, no, it's not you! It's
another Asuka--a princess.

191
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:42,583
Ah, that's right,
so when can you finally

192
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:44,625
go back to
living a normal life?

193
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:47,833
Only when peace has
been restored to the world.

194
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:50,416
So hurry up and
restore the peace!

195
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,916
What's the holdup?

196
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,750
It's not so cut and dry.

197
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:56,291
Peace does not come
without a great struggle.

198
00:11:56,375 --> 00:12:00,000
Eventually I may have
to leave this world forever.

199
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:02,416
You shouldn't think
about it so negatively.

200
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,833
Sooner or later every
story has to come to an end.

201
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:08,708
And then it's time to think
about what's going to come next.

202
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:11,375
You don't understand,
the struggle is eternal.

203
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:13,750
The fight for peace never ends.

204
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:19,000
If one day I do not return, just
know that I'll never forget you.

205
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:21,333
Don't get me wrong,
that's very flattering,

206
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:24,000
but how about we look
at things a different way?

207
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:26,458
If you could choose between
this world and Gretagard,

208
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:28,166
which world would you pick?

209
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,666
I don't think
I can answer that.

210
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:33,041
But, this world has been a
lot of fun lately, hasn't it?

211
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:35,666
And no matter what
happens in this world

212
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,416
you'll always
have me at your side.

213
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:41,375
So, tell me which
world you would pick.

214
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:43,625
I'd have to say Gretagard.

215
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:51,791
Listen, people in the other
world, they have it rougher

216
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:53,791
than anyone over here.

217
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:57,041
Everyone in Gretagard
truly needs my help.

218
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:06,791
What's with the toys?
Are they yours?

219
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,916
When I was a kid,
I had this little brother

220
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,125
that only I could see.

221
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:20,208
I decided to call him Asumu. My
parents were so busy with work

222
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:22,208
that the house was
always empty when I got home

223
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:23,625
and there'd be no one
to play with.

224
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:26,041
So I created a younger
sibling, someone who'd always

225
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:29,375
be there for me. I was pretty
quiet and shy growing up,

226
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:31,833
which isn't the best
recipe for making friends.

227
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:34,791
All my classmates thought
I was cold and mean.

228
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:36,583
Having a kid brother
that I could talk to

229
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:39,041
and play with seemed
like a great idea.

230
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:42,750
I gave him a name like mine.
It made him easier to remember.

231
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:46,416
Asumu and I had
a lot of fun together,

232
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,541
he helped me
forget all my troubles.

233
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:52,625
Oddly, he disappeared
once I became brave enough

234
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:56,541
to eat cucumbers.
I used to hate cucumbers.

235
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:59,208
I'm sorry, but what's
the point of all this?

236
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:00,291
You don't get it?

237
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:01,833
Don't get what?

238
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:05,125
What Asumu was for me all those
years, Gretagard is for you.

239
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:08,458
Gretagard is your Asumu.

240
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:11,583
W-what's the big idea,
joking around like that?

241
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:13,625
Gretagard is 100% real.

242
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:15,916
I think maybe
you should see this.

243
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:27,125
Wing Quest?

244
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:30,416
It's been a real long time since
anyone's brought that game up.

245
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,875
I can barely
remember it myself. Why now?

246
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:37,000
You see here. I'm at the point
where I've just rescued Garuda.

247
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:38,166
Huh?

248
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,333
In my other saved games,
I've also rescued

249
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:40,791
Eagle and Falcon as well.

250
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:42,458
Wha-What?

251
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:45,291
In Wing Quest, the kingdom
of Gretagard is under attack

252
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:46,583
from the yokujin.

253
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:48,583
Playing as the holy
knight Hawk, it's your job

254
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:52,583
to rally the troops and restore
peace to your homeland.

255
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:54,833
Go figure. How's that
for a coincidence?

256
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:56,708
Well, let's see.

257
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:58,541
There's also an easter
egg that lets you change

258
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:00,958
the princess's name
to whatever you want,

259
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:03,833
like to Princess Asuka. I
guess you went out of your way

260
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:07,208
to make me the princess,
that's kinda cute.

261
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:08,291
Please forgive me!

262
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:10,750
So you admit it!

263
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:13,875
What? You've got it all
wrong, completely wrong!

264
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:15,583
I think I've caught
you red-handed.

265
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:20,333
No one's ever named a video
game heroine after me before.

266
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:22,625
It's really flattering.

267
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:24,041
Stop messing around!

268
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:28,375
I really am Lord Hawk and
Gretagard is a real place!

269
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:32,458
Everyone in the kingdom
needs my help, all the time!

270
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:36,833
This world has never needed me.
I don't belong here!

271
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:37,916
I'm sorry.

272
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:43,583
There's no such place,
it doesn't exist.

273
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:56,875
Why you?

274
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:00,666
Of all people, why did you
have to turn on me, princess?!

275
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:03,041
Do you have any idea
what you meant to me?!

276
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:06,250
At some point,
you'll have to face reality.

277
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:07,958
Silence!

278
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:10,083
Oh Takashi.

279
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:23,458
Takashi! Takashi, wake up!

280
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:25,541
Ohhh my, I told you
that we needed

281
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:28,916
to keep everything secret.

282
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
This time, I'm afraid
he might be gone forever.

283
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:36,083
Forgive me for prying, but what
is it you see in poor Takashi?

284
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:37,750
After all, a cute girl
like you must have

285
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:40,083
the pick of the litter.

286
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,791
We connected.

287
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:44,708
I felt like we could be
ourselves around each other.

288
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:48,333
Like we could be honest. I
thought we had nothing to hide.

289
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:50,208
It's really sweet
to see some authenticity

290
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:52,041
in a world of bullshit.

291
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:57,250
But it is what it is;
you'll never see Takashi again.

292
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:59,375
And if he ever
does come back,

293
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:00,791
I'm not going
to let you see him.

294
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:01,875
Why-

295
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:03,250
Please, don't take it
the wrong way.

296
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:06,166
Besides, you're bound
to bounce back in due time.

297
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:08,166
It's just that you've cut
open the goose that lays

298
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:11,333
the golden egg, after all,
you didn't exactly leave us

299
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:13,208
with a whole lot of choices!

300
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:16,041
Please, don't tell me
this is the end.

301
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:19,333
I thought that we
were only getting started!

302
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:22,416
I want to help Takashi,
what's wrong with that!

303
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,500
A girl like you really oughta
learn when to let things go.

304
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:28,125
Slap on some makeup and
find yourself a new boyfriend.

305
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:29,625
Problem solved.

306
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:31,916
Just trust me Asuka-
What the-!

307
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,875
Shut your mouth!

308
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:37,916
Hey now, what're you
doing?! C'mon I-

309
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,541
Bring him back, you jerk!

310
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:48,375
Hayato, this is your cue!

311
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:52,333
Give me a freakin break!
Next time a little warning

312
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:53,458
would be nice!

313
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:54,958
Oh, so the poser returns.

314
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:57,000
Hold on a sec, what the
hell's goin' on here?!

315
00:17:57,083 --> 00:17:58,750
You could at least
give me a hint!

316
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,750
Hey, how come
she's still angry?!

317
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:07,541
You were supposed
to knock her out cold!

318
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:11,750
Stop it ya' bastard!

319
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:13,583
I ain't about to go
hittin a schoolgirl.

320
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:17,583
Aren't you the tough guy?

321
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:19,083
This girl's about
to slaughter us!

322
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:24,875
And aren't you supposed to
sweet talk us out of any mess-

323
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:35,333
The king has return-

324
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:36,791
Well, that was a new one!

325
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:39,083
Feed me the
beasts of the ocean!

326
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:41,416
She even managed
to bring out Karura.

327
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,125
I hate to say it but I think
we might be in trouble here.

328
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:47,291
The right personality
better show up, and fast.

329
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:53,583
This wasn't supposed to happen.

330
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:58,500
I didn't tell you everything
so it would come between us.

331
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:02,083
There's nothing wrong
with Gretagard, really.

332
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:05,041
We all have our
dreamworlds and fantasies,

333
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:07,041
they just can't
become permanent escapes

334
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:09,333
when we're afraid
to face reality.

335
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:11,833
There are times
I really miss Asumu,

336
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:13,958
he taught me how to smile!

337
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:17,333
It's been years since the
last time I played with him.

338
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:22,958
Too long, but I never forgot
what he taught me. You see?

339
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:26,000
You can't always live in
Gretagard, but you can remember

340
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:28,958
all the lessons Gretagard
has taught you and use them

341
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:31,541
to help you
in this world. Got it?

342
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:36,708
Hearing you say it makes
it sound so simple,

343
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:41,708
but I'm not like you, Asuka.
I don't have wings to guide me.

344
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:46,375
We without wings.
It's not so easy for us.

345
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:52,375
I told you to snap out of it!

346
00:19:57,916 --> 00:20:00,666
You don't need
any wings to be happy.

347
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:05,458
Just wake up. I want to be
with the real Takashi.

348
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:08,916
I want to talk to him.
I want to hear him laugh

349
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,875
and to see him smile.

350
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:14,625
In some ways
I'm envious of you.

351
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:17,666
I don't have your imagination,
and I can't up and leave

352
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,458
for make-believe
worlds anymore.

353
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:23,833
So keep on having your
adventures in Gretagard.

354
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:28,333
In fact, I want you to go there,
if that's what makes you happy.

355
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:31,166
You can leave for Gretagard
and go see Princess Asuka

356
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:33,583
anytime you'd like.

357
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:41,416
But, please, don't ever forget
that this Asuka loves you too!

358
00:20:54,833 --> 00:21:01,333
Hey, there, you don't
have to cry, I'm here.

359
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:03,750
You're late, idiot.

360
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:11,750
I think we've had enough
excitement for one day.

361
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:13,375
Mm, mmm-hmm.

362
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:16,250
Don't worry, you didn't
hit me that hard.

363
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:18,833
I'll get you when you
least expect it. Hyah!

364
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:21,500
It's hard to believe, it
took me so long to accept

365
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:24,958
that Gretagard
isn't a real place.

366
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:26,458
Thank you.

367
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:28,666
Wait, there's one more thing.

368
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:31,625
If I don't see you
again sometime soon,

369
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:33,458
I'm gonna slug ya!

370
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:37,250
Hello, I'm home.

371
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:39,125
Uhh, what happened?!

372
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:42,375
I tripped running up some
stairs; does it look terrible?

373
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:45,625
Looks pretty bad. Maybe you
should go to the hospital.

374
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:47,791
Nah, it'll heal up
in a few days.

375
00:21:56,458 --> 00:22:00,500
Use it wisely, a lot of blood,
sweat, and tears went into that.

376
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:03,833
Stay away from
filthy wenches.

377
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:06,625
Thank you, guys but
I don't deserve it.

378
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:10,500
I've done nothing with my life.
I haven't helped anyone at all.

379
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:18,833
You can't! I won't let you!

380
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:22,750
I'm sorry, but this is something
that both you and I have to do.

381
00:22:22,833 --> 00:22:24,458
You need to see a doctor first!

382
00:22:24,541 --> 00:22:25,625
Come on.

383
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:28,208
Hold on, I've almost
got her convinced!

384
00:22:28,291 --> 00:22:29,458
Kobato, keep quiet for once!

385
00:22:29,541 --> 00:22:31,416
You're not the boss of me!

386
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,250
How's about the two of you just
finish this in the car already?

387
00:22:34,333 --> 00:22:36,166
It's not like you're about
to let him take off and go,

388
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:37,041
little sister.

389
00:22:37,125 --> 00:22:37,958
My little-

390
00:22:38,041 --> 00:22:39,208
-Sister?

391
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:41,833
Seriously, just get in
the damn car already!

392
00:22:41,916 --> 00:22:42,958
Right!

393
00:22:46,083 --> 00:22:50,333
So. Father, do you think
griffins would be tasty?

394
00:22:50,416 --> 00:22:52,666
Hey are you listening to me?

395
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:25,291
You there, Mako? Sorry
to keep pestering you,

396
00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:28,166
but death isn't very
enjoyable! So much gloom!

397
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:31,000
I have but one simple request;
a dying or dead man's wish,

398
00:24:31,083 --> 00:24:33,125
if you will. Please
bring me back to life!

399
00:24:33,208 --> 00:24:34,625
Use your magical powers!

400
00:24:34,708 --> 00:24:37,166
I'm begging you; the condor's
career is in grave danger!
