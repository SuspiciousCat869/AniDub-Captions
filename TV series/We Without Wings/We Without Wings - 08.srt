1
00:00:17,125 --> 00:00:18,083
Ker chunk.

2
00:00:18,833 --> 00:00:19,916
Surprise!

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,291
Good morning!

4
00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:26,166
Oh, hello, I didn't
see you standing there.

5
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,375
Take my advice. When it
comes to those girls,

6
00:00:28,458 --> 00:00:30,250
it's just like that
song by Freaky Five.

7
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:31,583
Re-runs.

8
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:33,666
Who is the king?

9
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:34,958
It's you!

10
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:37,125
How's that for getting lucky?

11
00:00:37,208 --> 00:00:38,375
No way!

12
00:00:38,458 --> 00:00:41,083
Geez.

13
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:44,083
Let's see them titties, Eriko!

14
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:46,416
Two can play that game!

15
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,041
Huh uh.

16
00:00:48,125 --> 00:00:50,583
It appears as though I've
entered the wrong classroom.

17
00:00:50,666 --> 00:00:52,041
Ah, man.

18
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:55,416
Next move.

19
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,416
The cat's paw
on the inner groin!

20
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,333
The what?!

21
00:00:58,416 --> 00:01:00,083
Why don't I show you.

22
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:03,333
I guess these shows
are kinda interesting,

23
00:01:03,416 --> 00:01:05,333
but watching nothing
but reruns all the time

24
00:01:05,416 --> 00:01:07,416
is starting to get
a little stale.

25
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,583
Whatever though,
no point in being picky.

26
00:01:09,666 --> 00:01:12,833
I guess I have been here
for around 100,000 years.

27
00:01:12,916 --> 00:01:15,708
Hmm, or maybe
it's only been ten?

28
00:01:15,791 --> 00:01:18,083
Oh well, I can't tell
the difference anymore.

29
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:19,500
Welcome back, friends!

30
00:01:19,583 --> 00:01:21,750
Sounds like the story has
finally gotten underway!

31
00:01:21,833 --> 00:01:23,500
Who knows all the hours
you've spent tweaking

32
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,916
the antenna to pick up radio
waves on cloudy nights?!

33
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,875
At last, your devotion
is paying off!

34
00:01:27,958 --> 00:01:29,750
As for the Condor,
I'm starting to--

35
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:31,875
Farewell, friends!

36
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:33,708
The Condor has fallen!

37
00:01:33,791 --> 00:01:34,750
Karura!

38
00:01:34,833 --> 00:01:36,208
How long has it been?

39
00:01:36,291 --> 00:01:38,166
Did you miss me so much
that you came crashing down

40
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,458
from the world above?

41
00:01:40,541 --> 00:01:43,250
You're as good-natured and
healthy as ever, your majesty.

42
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:46,166
You, the disgraced king of
the Great Age of Gretagard,

43
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:48,208
who ran away from his
throne, and the father

44
00:01:48,291 --> 00:01:50,000
of our troubled kingdom.

45
00:01:50,083 --> 00:01:51,166
My liege.

46
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,125
Ha, don't tell me
that after all this time

47
00:01:53,208 --> 00:01:55,458
you're still obsessing
about Gretagard!

48
00:01:55,541 --> 00:01:57,208
You know, there are lots
of other really fun games

49
00:01:57,291 --> 00:01:58,583
you could play.

50
00:01:58,666 --> 00:02:02,083
Ah, good, so you already
know why I am here, my lord.

51
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:04,916
I must ask that you leave
this place, and return with me

52
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
to the land of
Gretagard at once.

53
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:08,125
I don't wanna!

54
00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:10,958
I'm having way more
fun down here!

55
00:02:11,041 --> 00:02:13,666
Lady Kobato requests
your presence, sir.

56
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,541
Could you really
turn her down?

57
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:18,250
You mean Birdy?

58
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:20,333
I still can't.

59
00:02:20,416 --> 00:02:21,916
A wise decision.

60
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,500
As for me, Garuda Dark-Black,
my selfless sacrifice

61
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:27,416
when confronted with
the lovely flesh of-

62
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,916
What do you mean you won't go?!

63
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,375
You mean to let Lady Kobato
suffer and drown in her own

64
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:33,333
tears of grief, as you
loaf around in your world

65
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:34,333
of make-believe?!

66
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:35,416
Do you truthfully
prefer clinging

67
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,958
to such false
pleasure, father?!

68
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:41,375
I'm never gonna
leave this place, never!

69
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:22,291
Kobato was finally able to calm
down. She felt really awful

70
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:26,875
about all the things she
said to Karura, wasn't it?

71
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:30,166
Wait, did he upset Kobato?

72
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:34,208
Hayato, your buddies practically
accepted him with open arms.

73
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:36,833
But then again, I never
would've thought that Kakeru

74
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:41,291
already knew so much about us.

75
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:44,458
Who gives a damn about that
chicken shit in the first place?

76
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:46,458
The main thing is-

77
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:49,541
It finally makes sense now,
what that priest said to us,

78
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:52,666
all those years ago.

79
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:57,500
Anger begets more anger, and
hatred brings about more hatred.

80
00:04:57,583 --> 00:05:00,166
Someone must bring
an end to this cycle.

81
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:03,000
It won't be easy,
by any means, and your path

82
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:06,625
will be fraught with
obstacles, but have faith.

83
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:09,041
Should you find yourself
at the end of your rope,

84
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:11,875
with your anger and
hatred about to boil over,

85
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:14,458
just recite this
chant to yourself.

86
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:17,875
It is only then that you
will regain your composure.

87
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:19,041
Now then-

88
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:21,125
"That the world
may know peace."

89
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:24,958
The priest somehow knew
that we'd be putting others

90
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:27,916
in danger, not just ourselves.

91
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,166
Well, perhaps we should
be a litte more careful

92
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,458
and not make
the guy mad, right?

93
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,541
So you're gonna have to watch
your what you say, Hayato!

94
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,375
Why're you just
callin' me out?

95
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:38,750
Though you're right,
it was my mistake.

96
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:40,083
I'll be careful.

97
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:44,000
Good, you're easy
to work with when you listen!

98
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:48,458
Besides that, there is one other
person that's kind of a problem.

99
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:51,375
Yoji Haneda,
Kobato's actual brother.

100
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:54,041
He's gonna be
a handful to deal with.

101
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:56,916
It's funny, all this time we've
been pulling for Takashi,

102
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,708
when it's actually
Yoji who's the real primary.

103
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:02,041
I'm not too sure
what we should do about that.

104
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:04,208
Sometimes, you're a real idiot.

105
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:12,708
Words can't describe how
disappointed I am in you.

106
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:13,500
So early?

107
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:14,750
What did I do?

108
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,500
At the very least, I was
hoping you'd make a few

109
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:20,125
well-timed "rookie mistakes",
say spilling cream all over

110
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:22,791
a young lady's rack,
then innocently telling them,

111
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:26,000
"Here is the cream-filled
pie you just ordered!"

112
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:28,000
So that's what
you're disappointed about?!

113
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:29,458
That's water under the bridge.

114
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:32,333
What I need from you now
is to get me a star-studded,

115
00:06:32,416 --> 00:06:33,708
big-busted cream girl!

116
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:34,916
Creamy!

117
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,708
Oh, well then,
what has gotten into him?

118
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:39,583
Are you tryin' to tell me
that you can't even handle

119
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:41,541
an order off
the cuff like that?

120
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:43,916
Greenhorn.

121
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,791
My training doesn't really
cover those sorts of "duties".

122
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:48,250
Not yet at least!

123
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:50,125
Which is why I'll be taking
all of your training over

124
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:52,125
from Tamaizumi,
starting today!

125
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:53,208
Huh?

126
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:54,375
Not to worry!

127
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:56,333
Business slows down
at this time of day.

128
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,791
Exactly, right now's
perfect for killing time

129
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:00,750
and messing with the new guy.

130
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:01,750
Killing time?!

131
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:03,625
What a poorly-run business!

132
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:05,416
Oh, and even though you're
supposed to be studying

133
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,250
for your exams, it's great to
see you in the shop, Kinako.

134
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:09,500
Wait!

135
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:12,750
If all of you are killing
time then count me in!

136
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,708
How does this place
make any money?!

137
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:16,250
Now then,
you're gonna play a waiter!

138
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:18,083
And I'll be the
straight man, kay?

139
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:20,000
Kinako, you can
be the funnyman!

140
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:21,750
What a berry important role!

141
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:23,791
That's funnyman,
not "punnyman."

142
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:24,333
Ok.

143
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:25,666
What's up, doc?

144
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,916
And no weak
impersonations either.

145
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,208
By the way, does anyone
know what "beddon" means?

146
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:31,000
Not a clue.

147
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:32,208
Okay here goes!

148
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:33,958
You can "beddon"
my next joke being funnier.

149
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:36,083
That set-up was terrible.

150
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:38,125
Thank you, and please
support your local artists!

151
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,291
Aw!

152
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:41,333
The waiter didn't even
get a single line.

153
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:42,458
Shusuke!

154
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:44,125
Hurry up and get me
that star-studded,

155
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:45,958
big-busted cream girl
I ordered!

156
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:47,375
Boss, bad news!

157
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:51,000
We're fresh out of star-studded,
big-busted cream girls!

158
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:52,333
Huh?

159
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:54,916
Seriously, what's
wrong with those guys?

160
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,833
Don't you mean
wrong with you?

161
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:01,625
My awareness has failed!

162
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:04,166
What was it you said
we were out of?

163
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,333
She must've heard
the entire thing!

164
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,250
For crying out loud, there's
always something you could be

165
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:12,666
doing around the café,
even when it's slow.

166
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,208
Right!

167
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:16,250
Check and straighten the tables
once per hour, if not more.

168
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:20,375
Article fifty-five,
paragraph one-sixty-five!

169
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:23,083
I, Shusuke Chitose,
have memorized our manual

170
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:26,458
front to back, per my
instructor Hiyoko's wishes!

171
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:27,291
That it?

172
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:28,958
Not even a pat on the back?

173
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:33,083
Oh, yeah, the employee
manual I gave you.

174
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:36,625
 Good job, um, that's amazing. 

175
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:39,333
You don't mean to tell me
you forgot that stuff.

176
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:40,708
 Of course not!

177
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:44,125
There's no way I'd do
something like that, right?

178
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:48,000
But you've got to remember,

179
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:50,541
there's more than just book
smarts to being a good waiter.

180
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:54,916
It's how you put that knowledge
to use that really matters.

181
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,583
Right!

182
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:57,166
Of course it is!

183
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,250
However.

184
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:00,375
You do well with
following directions.

185
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:04,333
As a waiter, that's good,
so keep it up, Shusuke.

186
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:09,166
W-Welcome to Alexander!

187
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,791
Shu?

188
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,833
So Karura's already
split again, I take it?

189
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:18,166
He keeps me waiting all this
time, shows up on a whim,

190
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,125
and disappears
once he's bored.

191
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:22,833
Talk about a selfish guy, huh?

192
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:25,583
And we had such fun, too!

193
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,041
Come on, don't.

194
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:28,291
Oh well!

195
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:31,125
In the meantime,
I'll just keep my eye on you.

196
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:33,250
What is it with you
and stalking me?!

197
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:35,083
Yummy!

198
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:37,875
--Welcome home, Marty!
--Good to see you, Mr. Marty!

199
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:39,791
Likewise, my sweet dearies!

200
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:42,375
Thank goodness you made it
back here in one piece!

201
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:45,041
I guess you're a whole lot
tougher than you look, huh?

202
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:47,833
Come now, I'm the exact
opposite of a tough guy!

203
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:49,583
Get in a little closer
and take a look at this

204
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:51,458
beautiful chocolatey skin!

205
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:54,291
Hey, keep your shirt on, you're
scarin' off the customers.

206
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:56,458
Hayato, how about you get in
on the fun and change into

207
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:58,250
your work clothes right here.

208
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:02,000
Oh yeah, one other thing;
this is for you.

209
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:05,416
Why, Dracula,
you really do love me!

210
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,833
I humbly accept your feelings.

211
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:08,375
Te amo también, ¡mi amor!

212
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:10,166
It'll keep ya out of harm's
way, at least that's what

213
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:13,500
the street merchant
who swindled me said.

214
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:15,250
Take that back, you ho!

215
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:17,166
How come you never buy
anything from me?!

216
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,375
Here ya go, Alice, you have it.

217
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:24,750
I promise to please Drac a lot.

218
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,500
Drac will be so happy
in every way.

219
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:31,625
Now what, wench?

220
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:33,583
If you Keep on starin' at
me like that, you're gonna

221
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,625
burn a hole through
my handsome face.

222
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:39,125
Actually, for some reason
I feel pretty relieved.

223
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:44,708
Hayato, you can be rough
and manly, and that's alright,

224
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:48,375
but honestly I like you
just fine the way you are now,

225
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:52,708
when you're more of a clown
instead of a tough guy.

226
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:53,875
Hey!

227
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:55,458
I just made you laugh!

228
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:57,333
Does that mean
I'm turning you on?!

229
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:59,375
Believe me, I'm ready
for anything and everything!

230
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:00,083
Wha-...

231
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:01,166
gimme a break, wench!

232
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,875
Whaddya think you're doing?!

233
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:04,791
Do you get it, Shusuke?

234
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:07,916
We've already gotten way
more than we really deserve.

235
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,750
We only exist in order
to protect Takashi,

236
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:12,833
not that withdrawn kid.

237
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:15,625
And if it weren't for him
taking on the toughest role,

238
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:18,291
the two of us
wouldn't even be here.

239
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:20,791
When Takashi graduates,
we'll get him to the hospital

240
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:23,000
and work on
getting him treated.

241
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:26,416
All our money, experience,
wisdom, after all,

242
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,833
everything we've done
is really for him.

243
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:33,000
So once he's returned to the
cockpit again, we'll disappear,

244
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:34,750
and it's all over.

245
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:36,125
That'll do.

246
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:50,375
Good morning.

247
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:53,708
Oh- good morning.

248
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:01,375
Huh?

249
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:02,500
For breakfast.

250
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:04,208
I normally just have
a piece of bread.

251
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:06,458
Uh-huh, I know.

252
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:17,583
And done!

253
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:30,000
Hello, Haneda.

254
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,500
Aren't you one of
my classmates?

255
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:33,500
Yamashina, right?

256
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:35,083
Uhhh, good morning.

257
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:37,833
Thanks, good morning
to you too.

258
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:40,166
I take it this is your house?

259
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,416
I walk by this place
every morning.

260
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:46,708
Yeah, I've seen you,
usually on your way to school.

261
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:48,208
It's kinda weird that
we've never really

262
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:49,583
talked before today.

263
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:51,416
Oh, sorry.

264
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,000
Well, you don't
need to apologize.

265
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:56,708
It's just that something
didn't feel quite right,

266
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:58,083
saying hello.

267
00:12:58,166 --> 00:13:00,291
Not quite right?

268
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:05,208
Uh, heh, yeah, I guess,
but least we're talking now.

269
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:06,250
Yep!

270
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:08,750
Oh, now you're
running late, sorry.

271
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:10,916
And today's the
last day for exams.

272
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,916
Um, is that all
you wanted to say?

273
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:18,166
Then I guess we'll
see each other later.

274
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:28,541
Hey!

275
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:30,750
How you doing
this morning, Haryu?

276
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:32,875
Oh, hello again.

277
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:34,750
It wasn't what
I'd consider cool,

278
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:37,583
but I still had a whole lot
of fun; it was fun enough

279
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:40,958
for the chicken
to show up, after all.

280
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:43,250
Things certainly made
for a good time.

281
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:45,458
Invite me along again someday.

282
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:48,083
Uh, yeah, sure.

283
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:49,000
Huh?

284
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:51,083
Ah, not you.

285
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:52,833
Where's King
Garuda Dark-Black?

286
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:55,083
That's who I was talking to.

287
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:58,541
Come to think of it,
who are you again?

288
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:12,541
Could it be that I am in the
legendary Nahato Woodlands?

289
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:14,125
Speak thy name!

290
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:17,875
Sparrow, my liege, allow me
to atone for my past sin,

291
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:19,666
for casting the magic
that opened the doorway

292
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:24,500
to another realm, forcing you
into this world, Lord Hawk.

293
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:25,750
Yamashina?

294
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:26,875
Why're you here?

295
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:29,458
It's Miyako,
just play along, okay.

296
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:32,625
My homeland is currently under
attack from a winged force.

297
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:35,875
If you could help me,
Lord Hawk, just this once-

298
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,125
The villains must pay!

299
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:39,708
Steady thy wing, Sparrow!

300
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:44,166
Worry no longer, Gretacalibur
shall protect you from harm!

301
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:47,458
Yokujin Scum,
I will kill them all.

302
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:48,708
Such anger.

303
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:51,000
Seems like you've been
bottling up quite a bit.

304
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:53,208
For the sake of justice!

305
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:54,458
Leuchten Greta!

306
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:56,666
Gretacaliburning!

307
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:58,625
Take that!

308
00:14:58,708 --> 00:14:59,666
Die, vermin!

309
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,500
Why don't you all just Die!

310
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:03,083
Not so tough now, are ya?!

311
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:04,666
Still wanna bully me around?!

312
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:09,500
Bloody bastards,
bow before your king!

313
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:12,291
It's really a shame, had things
started out differently,

314
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:15,500
they might have
actually become my allies.

315
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:17,250
Such caring words,

316
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:20,416
especially spoken towards
such hated enemies!

317
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,083
This is simply
the code of a warrior.

318
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:25,500
Lord Hawk!

319
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:28,875
Of course,
poison-tipped blades...

320
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:30,750
Rest yourself, Lord Hawk.

321
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:33,625
I'm aware of a
time-forgotten antidote.

322
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:35,833
Sparrow, what are you-

323
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,458
Please relax, my lord, and
allow me to cure what ails you.

324
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:56,500
Wait, Yamashina, no!

325
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:58,000
We can't do this!

326
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:05,125
I think your body's
telling me otherwise.

327
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:08,333
No need to worry,
it's just a dream, after all.

328
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:15,916
Is my lord ready
for the antidote?

329
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,125
Yes, please begin.

330
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:25,125
How does it feel?

331
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:28,166
Really soft, and so, so warm.

332
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,583
Could this be
a miracle from the gods?

333
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:38,791
Now, expel the vicious
toxin from your body.

334
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:02,541
Forgive me, Asuka.

335
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:04,625
I'm sorry, Miyako.

336
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:07,041
Wait, are you crying?

337
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:08,083
Don't be silly.

338
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:09,750
Why would I shed a tear?

339
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:11,791
Born with the invincible
spirit of a warrior,

340
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:14,833
I've locked away my
sorrows my entire life.

341
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:18,208
It's almost
second nature to me.

342
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:20,541
Indeed. So, I take it
you will, again,

343
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:23,458
depart from this
world Lord Hawk.

344
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:31,125
Being summoned right before
an exam is not an easy task.

345
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:33,500
Do you find this fun?

346
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:35,791
It seems kinda boring to me.

347
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:37,750
Oh- yeah.

348
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:38,958
Something wrong?

349
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:40,791
Did you mess up
on your tests?

350
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:42,000
Huh?

351
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:43,791
Yeah, those probably
could've gone better.

352
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:46,166
Ya know, I don't think
Miyako came to class today,

353
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,541
at least I don't
remember seeing her.

354
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:50,750
It makes me wonder
how she's doing.

355
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:52,500
Ugh, so you're
one of those guys.

356
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:54,333
The kind who's thinking about
other girls even though

357
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:56,875
he's already got
a wonderful girlfriend?

358
00:17:56,958 --> 00:17:58,166
No, of course not!

359
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,833
It's just that I'm
a little worried about her.

360
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:03,750
I'll have you know that
I take major offense to this.

361
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,000
Please don't.

362
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:07,083
So, from now on,
you'll have to work extra hard

363
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:08,958
to win back my favor.

364
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:11,041
What do you want me to do?

365
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:14,708
Tests are over, which
also means no more homework.

366
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:18,333
Once in a while I'd like
to go out and have some fun.

367
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:22,041
I'll have you know that
my schedule's completely empty.

368
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:25,666
That's right,
no plans at all!

369
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:30,541
Uh, if you want to,
we could probably go somewhere.

370
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:33,041
All right!

371
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:35,666
So, do you enjoy
playing video games?

372
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:38,458
Um, I suppose I do.

373
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:39,916
Hey wait a minute,
does this mean that

374
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,875
you're really into video games?

375
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:43,500
There is one
I'm really interested in,

376
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,625
and I want you
to help me look for it.

377
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:48,541
You use swords and magic
to level your character up!

378
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:50,250
Ha, hyah!

379
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:53,041
Ah, yeah, it sounds
like it's an RPG.

380
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:55,541
Well, if you want
to go pick it up later-

381
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:56,916
I'd love to!

382
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,250
I'll be waiting for you
outside at the gate, 'kay?

383
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:01,250
Make sure you show up early!

384
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:04,125
I'm so excited.

385
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:06,125
We're finally hanging out!

386
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,750
So, Haneda, where the hell
have you been hiding all day?

387
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:16,583
More importantly, why do you
look as if you're heading out?

388
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:18,458
Is something the matter, Masako?

389
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:20,000
You're damn right it is.

390
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:22,541
Are we ever gonna get to work
on those graduation essays?

391
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:23,875
The semester's almost over,

392
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:26,791
and we still gotta
figure out what to write about.

393
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:29,416
I thought you weren't
interested in doing those.

394
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,625
Yeah you're right,
I don't really care.

395
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:33,375
But we still have to do 'em.

396
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:34,833
Of course.

397
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:36,625
How about we
do them tomorrow?

398
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,666
I've kind of got
an errand to run today.

399
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,166
Tomorrow?

400
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,375
I think you're just trying
to avoid your responsibilities!

401
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:44,250
You are one selfish prick,
ya know that?

402
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:47,833
Think about all the crap I'll
have to do to cover your ass!

403
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:48,958
Sorry.

404
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:50,208
Whatever.

405
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:51,375
So let's go ahead and
nip this little problem

406
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:52,916
in the bud right now.

407
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,250
First we'll grab some lunch,

408
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:56,166
then come back here
to work around one o'clock.

409
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,625
But- That won't work!

410
00:19:57,708 --> 00:19:59,625
We might as well
just get started now-

411
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:04,708
What has gotten into you?

412
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:11,916
Sorry, about that.

413
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,208
But it was an accident; I
didn't want to look down there.

414
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:19,291
That's the best you'll ever do!

415
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:21,166
I'm sorry for interrupting.

416
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,541
Is everything ok?

417
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:27,833
So then, what was it
you wanted to tell me?

418
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:30,875
Something about being able
to help me out this afternoon?

419
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:33,375
O-oh, right, of c-course!

420
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:35,833
This afternoon it is.

421
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:39,916
Today your boyfriend's got
quite the busy schedule!

422
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,875
And on top of that, he's been
ogling at other girls' panties;

423
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:46,625
how about you do everyone a
favor and give him some sugar

424
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:48,666
every once in a while, okat?

425
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,458
You are his girlfriend,
after all.

426
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:52,250
Stop it, that's enough!

427
00:20:54,958 --> 00:21:00,250
Please, don't listen to her,
she's just-trying to get-

428
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:01,416
Ha!

429
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,750
I'm just here
to pick you up, slowpoke!

430
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:10,166
About that, I'm sorry, but I
can't today, something came up.

431
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:11,916
Really.

432
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,416
Well, guess I shouldn't
be too surprised!

433
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:19,958
But why did this
have to happen?

434
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:22,750
It's not supposed
to always be this way!

435
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:26,583
Takashi, are you alright?

436
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:28,583
Your face is losing its color!

437
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:29,958
Princess?

438
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:32,833
No, that's still
the other Asuka.

439
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:36,750
I'm sorry you had to see me
like this, but I have to go now;

440
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:38,416
this world is just stifling me.

441
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,916
But where are you going?

442
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,250
Gretagard, everyone, they're
all waiting for me there,

443
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:46,708
for the saintly knight
Hawk Cyan-Blue to make

444
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:48,041
his triumphant return.

445
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:50,666
Oh, so where is Gretagard?

446
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,416
How long will you be gone?

447
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,625
I'll be back very soon.

448
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:59,333
After all, we-
We don't have any wings.

449
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:05,750
Wow.

450
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:09,416
I just- it's amazing!

451
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:12,791
What do I do?

452
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:14,250
This's the real thing!

453
00:23:46,375 --> 00:23:48,041
He may have been
caught up in a "scramble,"

454
00:23:48,125 --> 00:23:50,916
but that's no reason to run
his mouth off about Gretagard.

455
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,625
Not too smart, Takashi.

456
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:56,708
I don't know what else to do.

457
00:23:56,791 --> 00:23:59,500
I better run the usual "dazed
and confused" pattern here.

458
00:23:59,583 --> 00:24:01,083
Heyyy, what's up?

459
00:24:01,166 --> 00:24:04,000
Um. I need to get back to the
game that I was just playing.

460
00:24:04,083 --> 00:24:05,291
Here I go!

461
00:24:05,375 --> 00:24:06,833
See ya in a little bit!

462
00:24:06,916 --> 00:24:08,791
The hero leaves,
marching into battle!

463
00:24:08,875 --> 00:24:11,000
Hey!

464
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:12,833
Where is Takashi Haneda?

465
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:20,125
Multiple personalities.

466
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:22,166
How about that?

467
00:24:23,166 --> 00:24:24,583
Talk about a plot twist!

468
00:24:24,666 --> 00:24:26,375
Who would've thought that your
beloved narrator would die

469
00:24:26,458 --> 00:24:27,666
in the first few minutes?!

470
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,500
Lucky for you, I thought
ahead and prerecorded

471
00:24:29,583 --> 00:24:30,958
the previews before I croaked!

472
00:24:31,041 --> 00:24:33,291
Who says the Condor
never gave back to his fans?!

473
00:24:33,375 --> 00:24:35,125
So tune in next week for
"My Heart is Heaving!"

474
00:24:35,208 --> 00:24:37,166
You're bound to enjoy it,
alive or dead!
