1
00:00:16,291 --> 00:00:17,000
Yay, yay.

2
00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:18,541
If you're just joining us,

3
00:00:18,625 --> 00:00:21,208
you've missed some incredibly
sexy wardrobe malfunctions!

4
00:00:21,291 --> 00:00:23,833
Yay, yay, yay, yay, yay.

5
00:00:23,916 --> 00:00:25,666
But now, dear viewers,
it's time to move

6
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:29,375
onto the final tournament of the
"Nothing-But Girls" Swim Meet!

7
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:30,458
What, already?!

8
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:32,416
The teams are lined up
and ready to go!

9
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,041
The rules are simple:
all contestants must

10
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:36,625
keep their balance and
not fall to score points.

11
00:00:36,708 --> 00:00:40,458
And for extra ones.
Rip off each other's swimsuits!

12
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:45,333
Alright, all of you
bodacious babes, start!

13
00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:47,791
Passion, heat.

14
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:50,708
My heart it skips a beat.

15
00:00:50,791 --> 00:00:53,708
Against the destiny

16
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:57,166
for your desire.

17
00:00:58,166 --> 00:01:00,000
Gotcha, Hiyoko!

18
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:02,791
Likewise, Asuka!

19
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:10,083
Eye of the shifting stars above!

20
00:01:10,166 --> 00:01:11,625
I win!

21
00:01:14,416 --> 00:01:16,541
Oh, hey, Kobato!
That top looks itchy!

22
00:01:16,625 --> 00:01:18,041
--Naru, you look scary!
--Let me help you out!

23
00:01:18,125 --> 00:01:20,666
--No, stay away!
--I don't mind at all!

24
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:23,625
No, stop it, let me go!

25
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:25,500
 Don't you dare!

26
00:01:25,583 --> 00:01:27,791
Yeah, that's it,
take it all off!

27
00:01:27,875 --> 00:01:29,625
As you wish!

28
00:01:35,083 --> 00:01:36,625
DJ Condor here, folks!

29
00:01:36,708 --> 00:01:40,375
Wow, I've gotta say
that made my, uh, spirits rise!

30
00:01:40,458 --> 00:01:42,166
Hey, do you wonder in what
kind of reality a swim meet

31
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:43,708
like that would take place?

32
00:01:43,791 --> 00:01:46,083
If you ask ol' DJ Condor,
it seems more like an illusion

33
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:47,583
or a dream, don't ya think?!

34
00:01:47,666 --> 00:01:48,875
Well, if you wanna
share your thoughts,

35
00:01:48,958 --> 00:01:50,666
the phone lines are open!

36
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:34,291
With Kinako going
away for a month,

37
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:38,708
I decided to hire Shusuke
here on a part-time basis.

38
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:41,208
You guys already know me,
so here's the short version!

39
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:43,666
I'm a veteran part-timer and
I rode up on a white horse

40
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,083
to work here at Alexander!

41
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:46,583
My favorite city's Alexandria,

42
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:49,166
and my favorite exercise
tool's the Expander!

43
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,000
Don't know how long I'll be
here, but I'm looking forward

44
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:52,250
to working with you.

45
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:54,041
I wish I could say the same!

46
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:55,666
Well, tomorrow's my
last day before I take

47
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,500
a leave of absence to study.

48
00:03:57,583 --> 00:04:00,333
It's a real shame you and I
won't be able to work together.

49
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:01,916
Yeah, I'll say.

50
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,916
Don't worry about it; you've got
more important things to do,

51
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,208
like focusing on your studies.

52
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:07,791
Good luck.

53
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:09,333
Thank you, Shu!

54
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,500
By the way, Hiyoko,
if you wouldn't mind-

55
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:12,750
Yes?

56
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:14,291
I've decided that I'm
gonna put you in charge

57
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:16,250
of Shusuke's training!

58
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:18,958
Actually, I do mind, so no.

59
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:21,791
Why do the girls
always say no?

60
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:22,916
What?

61
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,208
Is there a problem,
Trainer Tamaizumi?

62
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:26,333
Yes there is.

63
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:28,500
Oh, and I'm not
a trainer, either.

64
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:32,208
C'mon, what kind of
problem could you have?

65
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:33,375
Let me think.

66
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:34,791
If a girl doesn't
wanna work with Shusuke,

67
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:37,666
then that must mean
she hates, hates, hates,

68
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,625
and really hates
him with a passion!

69
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:41,750
You don't have to rub it in!

70
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,916
 I wouldn't go that far.

71
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,541
Well, there's no
problem then, right?

72
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:55,666
Fine, I'll do it.

73
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,833
Good, I knew
I could count on you.

74
00:04:57,916 --> 00:04:59,666
Ah, geez.

75
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:02,708
Still, better you
than me, though.

76
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:05,666
Training starts in
five minutes, Shusuke.

77
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,083
Yeah!

78
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:17,125
Shusuke?

79
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:18,500
Yes?!

80
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:19,666
Before we get started,

81
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,750
there's something
I need to ask you first.

82
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:23,875
Uh! What's that?

83
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:25,166
Well, um.

84
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,583
You told Eriko my
new book was interesting.

85
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:28,833
Is that true?

86
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:30,250
Did you really mean it?

87
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:31,625
Do you really feel that way?

88
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:36,500
Uh! Sure I do. I guess.

89
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:39,875
Even though
I haven't read it yet.

90
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:41,833
I couldn't say it at the time.

91
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:45,458
But when you said that,
it made me incredibly happy.

92
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:48,250
Oh, um?

93
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:56,208
So thank you
very much for that.

94
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:00,208
Sure thing.

95
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:04,875
Now then.

96
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:06,208
Let's get down to business
and begin your training

97
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:09,250
as an Alexander employee.

98
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:10,458
What is that?

99
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:12,625
The training manual
for all staff members.

100
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:14,791
Most of it should
be self-explanatory.

101
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:17,916
Make sure you read the entire
thing before your next work day.

102
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Okay.

103
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:20,416
That's it.

104
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,875
Wait, don't you have anything
more to teach than just

105
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:24,083
"hey, read this
gi-normous book?!"

106
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:24,875
Problem?

107
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:26,416
Um, you're joking, right?

108
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,458
You don't actually expect me
to read a book that's the size

109
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:30,083
of a small country, do you?

110
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:31,416
Come on!

111
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:36,708
I'm not joking, and I do expect
you to memorize everything.

112
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:38,041
Now get to it.

113
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:47,375
What did I get
myself into here?

114
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:52,333
Oh, hey, Kobato.

115
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,750
Well, I guess it has been
awhile, so I won't blame you

116
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,291
if you've forgotten who I am.

117
00:06:58,375 --> 00:07:01,541
I'm Shusuke Chitose, remember?

118
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:05,166
Oh, so you do remember me,
huh? That's awesome.

119
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,666
Good evening.

120
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,833
Same to you.

121
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:09,000
What's up?

122
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:10,375
Looks like you're
headed out somewhere.

123
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:11,541
It's kinda late, though.

124
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:13,125
Uh.

125
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:16,166
We ran out of soy sauce, so I'm
going to the convenience store

126
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,666
down the street to get some.

127
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:18,875
All by yourself?

128
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:20,583
Hey, do you want me
to go with you?

129
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:22,625
No thanks, I'm fine!

130
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:23,750
Okay.

131
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:25,625
But just be careful, alright?

132
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:26,583
Um.

133
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:27,291
Oh.

134
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:28,458
You change your mind?

135
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:30,583
No, what are those
things you're holding?

136
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:32,250
What, you mean this?

137
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:35,416
It's some homework stuff
for this job I just started.

138
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,250
Good luck on your new job.

139
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:38,625
Thank you!

140
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,250
I need it with all the
reading that I've gotta do!

141
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:41,791
Wow, so I guess
you're not only cute,

142
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:43,583
but you're also really nice!

143
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,625
I've gotta go now.

144
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:48,375
I'll see ya!

145
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:50,166
Yeah, you have a good one!

146
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:53,250
That Kobato's
pretty cute, isn't she?

147
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:57,750
It's a good thing she doesn't
resemble her brother very much.

148
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:00,250
Eco-bag!

149
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:02,958
Yeah.

150
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:04,583
I'm really impressed with what
I've seen of the article

151
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:06,125
you're writing for
next month's issue.

152
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:08,333
So much that I would
like to push it up a month.

153
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:09,333
Suh-weet!

154
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:10,916
That's awesome!

155
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,250
So you're okay with that?

156
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:14,166
Because it is gonna
shrink your deadline.

157
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:14,958
No problem!

158
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:16,500
You can count on me!

159
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:20,625
Now then.

160
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:23,291
I don't have much time, so I
guess I'll have to concentrate.

161
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:37,875
Oh, no, I don't
see it here, either.

162
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:40,833
Hey, don't worry, I'll find
it, I'm a fixer, remember?

163
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:44,791
Um, judging by the way
that you're dressed,

164
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:47,333
I guess you're a construction
worker, too, right?

165
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:48,583
Yeah, that's right.

166
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:50,083
To be honest, I'm pretty
wiped out to be lookin'

167
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:51,958
for your damn bike right now.

168
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:56,125
That uniform of yours
has a whole lot of pockets,

169
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:57,416
doesn't it?

170
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,958
Wow!

171
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:00,875
I bet you could put lots of
candy in them if you wanted to!

172
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:02,708
Would you quit starin'
at me like that, wench?

173
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:05,666
You're eyein' me
like a hungry hamster .

174
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,125
I'm sorry.

175
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:09,833
It's just that I find men
in work clothes attractive.

176
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:12,375
Seeing a hard-working man
all rumpled and stained

177
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:14,250
makes me want
to jump up and yell out.

178
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:15,916
Wahoo!

179
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,125
I know I'm good lookin',
but take my word for it,

180
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:19,375
I'm bad news, wench.

181
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:20,833
You'll end up
havin' your heart broken.

182
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:23,666
Do yourself a favor and don't
get a crush on me, okay?

183
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:26,208
Oh, I don't have any
worry of that happening.

184
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:27,458
That was quick!

185
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:32,291
Oh, my.

186
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:33,541
What?

187
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:37,875
I don't understand why,
but I just felt a B-DMP.

188
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:38,916
Huh?

189
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,208
A beating deep in my heart.

190
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:44,500
Could this be love?

191
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:46,583
Well, maybe not, it could
possibly be that I'm just

192
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:48,166
coming down with an illness.

193
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,708
Yeah, maybe you're
just gettin' sick.

194
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:52,708
Like with a cold or somethin'.

195
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:54,291
To be more exact.

196
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:57,833
Maybe it's a different kind of
sick, in this case, lovesick.

197
00:09:57,916 --> 00:10:00,041
Perhaps it hits me when
I see a guy in work clothes,

198
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:02,041
and that makes me feel the
same way that you do whenever

199
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:05,625
you see pretty girls
in sexy school uniforms.

200
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:07,708
Hey, if you accuse me of
havin' a schoolgirl fetish,

201
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:11,375
I'm gonna take you to court and
sue you for defamation, wench!

202
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:14,666
I definitely have
a work clothes fetish.

203
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,333
Geez, would you get
a hold of yourself?

204
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:19,041
You're my client, and hey,
close your mouth, would ya?

205
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:20,125
You're droolin'.

206
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:20,583
Oh!

207
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:21,958
Drac!

208
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:23,833
Um, will you let me
see your helmet, pretty please?!

209
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:25,166
Hey, wait, if I do.

210
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,875
You promise to
give it back, ri-

211
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:28,083
 Oh, wow!

212
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:30,458
This is an honest-to-goodness
work helmet!

213
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:31,791
Yippee.

214
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:35,166
Hey, Drac, you don't mind
if I put it on, do you?

215
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,625
No, but I was sweatin'
in it for awhile,

216
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:38,833
so I'm sure it really stinks.

217
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:40,541
Oh, I doubt it!

218
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:44,125
Don't blame me!

219
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:45,541
The job makes me sweat!

220
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:47,333
C'mon, it's construction!

221
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:48,958
Uh.Sure.

222
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:52,333
You have a job that requires a
whole lot of physical exertion.

223
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:54,125
But honestly, I've
smelled porta-potties

224
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:55,458
that were more pleasant.

225
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:57,833
Wow, thanks for
bein' so understanding'.

226
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:08,000
Hey, yo homey, whatcha knowin',
how's it flowin', and a'goin'?

227
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:10,583
Oh, hey, look, it's Mr. Soda!

228
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:14,000
We thought that was
you we saw, Narita.

229
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:15,208
We've been looking for you.

230
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:17,375
You wanna join us for a smoke?

231
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:20,083
These jokers are members of
the Yanagihara Flame Birdes.

232
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:22,750
Also known as the YFB.
They're the henchmen

233
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:24,958
of Kakeru Otori, its leader.

234
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:28,625
Bird-brained asshole, and yep,
the older brother of Naru here.

235
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:31,208
They call themselves the
city's "defenders of justice,"

236
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:33,625
but they leave
a lot to be desired.

237
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:35,375
Hey, are you okay, Drac?

238
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:36,875
You poor thing.

239
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:38,708
You look like you haven't
been getting very much sleep.

240
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:40,500
Gee, I wonder why?

241
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:42,208
So what's up with you bozos?

242
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:44,750
Did I hear you say
somethin' about lookin' for me?

243
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:47,875
Yeah, and the reason why is.

244
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:49,333
Uh.

245
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:51,875
Yo, Narita, we need to meet
ya, we need to talk, bro,

246
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:53,291
but on the down-low!

247
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:55,708
Guys.

248
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:58,041
You can be a real pain
in the ass sometimes.

249
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:02,166
Look, it's like my man LR 2001
said, this is just between us,

250
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,541
and you've gotta
keep it a secret.

251
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:04,958
Okay?

252
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:07,666
There is this killer,
awesome party goin' on tonight.

253
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,416
It's called the "Twilight Rave
Party," and it's supposed to be

254
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,750
rockin' from dusk 'til dawn!

255
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,166
You want me to dance?

256
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,875
No, but what do you know
about this gang called R-Wing?

257
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:17,833
Not much.

258
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:19,625
Then here's the skinny, bro.

259
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:22,083
They're a goth gang full
of loons and jerks who've

260
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:24,291
been acting like they
own the entire city.

261
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:26,750
Sounds like they've got
a lot in common with you guys.

262
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:28,791
Hey, we're nothing
like those dudes!

263
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:30,708
They're all
major-league whackjobs!

264
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:33,791
Those guys are crazy,
their brains are hazy,

265
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:36,375
they'll stab you in the gut,
and shoot you in the butt!

266
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:37,750
Yeah, no kiddin'!

267
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:40,208
They say stuff like "Pledge
allegiance to the guru"

268
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:42,166
and "Eradicate the infidels!"

269
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,583
Real crazy psycho
crap like that!

270
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:47,166
And they walk around carryin'
knives and guns, too!

271
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,666
That doesn't sound good.

272
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:51,291
No, it doesn't, so we wanna know
if you would be interested

273
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:54,125
in coming with us before we go
to that all-night rave thing.

274
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:56,000
And help us bring down
the hammer of justice

275
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:57,958
on all those R-Wing jackasses!

276
00:12:58,041 --> 00:13:00,291
After all, we are the
allies of justice , Drac.

277
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:01,791
Oh, man!

278
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:04,083
I think I hear the famous
battle cry of the YFB comin'!

279
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:04,916
Ready, guys?!

280
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,916
Yeah!

281
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,958
We are the
defenders of justice!

282
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:09,250
Criminals beware!

283
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:13,541
We are The Yanagihara
Flame Birdes!

284
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:14,541
Oh, yeah!

285
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:16,125
YFB!

286
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:20,791
What is that?

287
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:22,791
The YFB T-shirt!

288
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:23,500
Want one?!

289
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,875
No.

290
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:31,291
Later, Drac!

291
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:35,541
Must be annoying for you.

292
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:36,166
 Sorry.

293
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,666
What?

294
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,166
You know, havin' a brother mixed
up in all that kinda crap.

295
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,000
Yeah, I guess so.

296
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:43,958
Well, at least it used to be.

297
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:46,791
Back when I saw Kakeru
more often, that is.

298
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:49,541
"Used to?" Are you and him
on bad terms or somethin'?

299
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:52,875
Well, it's hard to say.

300
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:55,333
But we don't live
in the same house anymore.

301
00:13:57,375 --> 00:14:00,875
If we run into each other, we'll
talk, but aside from that-.

302
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:02,791
Oh.

303
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,208
Yeah, I know.

304
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:06,333
It seems kinda weird, huh?

305
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:10,041
No.

306
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:11,500
It's not at all.

307
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:15,333
In fact, I know a whole
buncha siblings like that.

308
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:17,333
So, you think it's normal?

309
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:21,166
See you again tomorrow!

310
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,166
In front of Pal Crepe, 'kay?!

311
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,666
Hey, in front of
Pal Crepe, 'kay?!

312
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,458
What are you,
a parrot or somethin'?

313
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:30,750
I heard you the first
time. Now get movin' or

314
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:33,750
you'll miss your train;
I'll see you tomorrow, wench.

315
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:35,041
See ya!

316
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,291
Uh, hey, wait!

317
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:38,083
Hold on!

318
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:38,625
Hey!

319
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:39,833
Naru!

320
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:48,833
Are you deaf?

321
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:50,875
Didn't you hear me
yellin', you dingbat?

322
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:54,416
What are you grinnin' about?

323
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,125
You almost lost your wallet.

324
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:57,708
That make you
happy or somethin'?

325
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:58,958
No.

326
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:00,291
But hearing you finally
call me Naru instead of

327
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:02,875
"wench" or "Otori"
certainly does!

328
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:04,416
Aw, geez!

329
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,333
If I'd called you by your last
name, you might have thought

330
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:08,333
I was yellin' for your brother!

331
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:10,583
You still said it, though!

332
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:12,708
The truth is I dropped
my wallet on purpose

333
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:15,000
in the hopes that
you'd call me that!

334
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:17,875
Don't feel stupid just
'cause you fell for it!

335
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:21,500
Go ahead, do it!

336
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:23,250
What, smack you?

337
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:26,666
Hold still.

338
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:32,916
Your train's here.

339
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:33,916
Get on it.

340
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,500
Um.

341
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:35,791
Okay!

342
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:52,125
Idiot.

343
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:53,750
Man, what a mess.

344
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:10,750
Dammit.

345
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:12,500
Why am I still
lookin' for her bike?

346
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:22,000
So that's R-Wing, huh?

347
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:27,416
Friggin' morons.

348
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,333
So they're
really gonna do this.

349
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:37,875
If it isn't the
Yanagihara Flame Chickens.

350
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:40,833
Oh, snap, you just dissed us,
bro; We ain't about to take

351
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,750
all that lame shit, yo!

352
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:44,166
You got our
name wrong, clowny!

353
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,541
It's the Yanagihara
Flame Birdes!

354
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:49,250
And in addition to the
iron hammer of justice,

355
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:51,500
here's a little
somethin' extra for ya !

356
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:52,833
Hey!

357
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:53,916
It's really funny that
they're gettin' "the bird"

358
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,583
from a bunch of Birdes,
dontcha think?!

359
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:57,875
Dude, that is freakin'
hilarious, now let's serve

360
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:00,708
these bums up some justice
so we can go to that rave!

361
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:02,083
Infidels!

362
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:04,083
By the stigmata of our lord,
we shall punish you who

363
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:07,333
cannot be forgiven and
smite thee from this world!

364
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,791
Oh, you know what
I say to that, moron?

365
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:14,083
This! Go suck a dick and die!

366
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:16,208
Ya'll are some
gloomy-ass bitches!

367
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:19,500
So how 'bout I brighten things
up a little for ya, okay?!

368
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:21,833
Kaboom, you buncha weirdos!

369
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Firecrackers, son,
that's what it takes;

370
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:30,125
To lay the smack down
on you punk-ass fakes!

371
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:30,916
That worked, man!

372
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,125
They're crazy-ass scared!

373
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:35,833
Bastards.

374
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:37,291
How dare you?!

375
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:38,625
Now!

376
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:40,250
R-Wing, attack and rip
these filthy Birdes apart

377
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:41,375
feather by feather!

378
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:42,625
Yes, Sir!

379
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:44,958
Now let's punish those
who cannot be forgiven!

380
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:47,291
Uh-oh, here they come!

381
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:48,166
I'm so scared!

382
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,458
Chew on this, you goth goons!

383
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,833
Ooh, yeah, baby;
I see London, I see France!

384
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:01,791
So who's next, homies?

385
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:02,416
What?!

386
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,875
YFB rules, losers!

387
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,041
You damn perverts!

388
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:07,291
I'll make you pay for this!

389
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:08,833
You take the ones
who went that way!

390
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:10,125
We'll take the ones over here!

391
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:11,541
Sir!

392
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:16,125
Geez.

393
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:17,291
You're him, right?

394
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:19,125
Their "guru" or whatever?

395
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:23,208
You could stop this.

396
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:24,666
It'd be a damn shame if
those bikes got trashed

397
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,583
'cause of all this nonsense.

398
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:30,041
I don't claim the
title they've given me,

399
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:32,458
but if they want to
call me that, well,

400
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:33,875
that's their prerogative.

401
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:34,791
What?!

402
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:36,625
Oh, so that's how it is.

403
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:39,125
They follow you, but you won't
claim any responsibility

404
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:40,666
for what they do.

405
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:43,625
That's a real piss-poor
excuse you've got there, pal.

406
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,833
C'mon, one "stop"
from you is all it'd take

407
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:49,416
to keep people
from gettin' hurt.

408
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,000
It'd have to be you 'cause
I don't see the leader

409
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:52,875
of the YFB anywhere.

410
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:55,375
Uh?

411
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:56,166
What?

412
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,750
He's behind you.

413
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:01,833
Welcome, amigos.

414
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:04,541
To the feast of purgatory!

415
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:08,666
Hey, it's the boss!

416
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:09,791
Yo, Kakeru!

417
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:10,958
How nice.

418
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:12,625
It looks like
everyone made it here

419
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:14,708
for this momentous occasion.

420
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:16,375
My loyal flock.

421
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:18,166
My foul foes.

422
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,916
The prelude is at an end.

423
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,541
After tonight, there will be
a new song to sing!

424
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:25,750
It will be an ode
to the Phoenix!

425
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,916
Oh, and what's this?

426
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,250
Has the aloof Falcon decided
to fly with the hated Crow?

427
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:34,000
Had a change of heart, did you?

428
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:37,375
What happened, did you get
lonely in your own nest, Falcon?

429
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:39,166
Wait, "Falcon?"

430
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,625
Shut it.

431
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:42,750
I was just passin' through
and came across these goons.

432
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:44,166
I couldn't care less
for either of you guys

433
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,166
or your stupid little war.

434
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,416
Take out the Phoenix!

435
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:51,375
You lot are
nothing but pissants!

436
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:53,541
I've come here to fight
the Crow, and if that means

437
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,333
I have to go
through you to do it.

438
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:57,458
That'll be fine!

439
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:01,791
Hey there, Phoenix!

440
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:04,125
Aw, for the love of-!

441
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:06,458
Can you rise from
the ashes of this?!

442
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:10,916
Otori, no!

443
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,166
It doesn't hurt.

444
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:15,041
It doesn't hurt not at all!

445
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:17,750
But what is gonna
are you losers!

446
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Me and my flock are
gonna clip the wings

447
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:22,666
of each and every one of you!

448
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:26,625
Right. Now! And I'm
starting with you, Bozo!

449
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:28,708
No! You won't even
get the chance!

450
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:30,458
Hey man! Put it down!

451
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:33,250
Get your hands off of me,
infidel, this is a holy war!

452
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,375
No, both of your groups
are actin' stupid,

453
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:37,791
and you even more so
by bringin' a gun!

454
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:39,250
Oh Shit!

455
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:40,666
He's gone crazy!

456
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:45,625
You moron! You're
gonna kill somebody!

457
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:46,833
Let me go!

458
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:49,625
I will not be denied!

459
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:52,833
If you want to stop
some bullets, then so be it!

460
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:53,916
Shit!

461
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:58,458
Sorry, but I'm not
done with you just yet!

462
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:02,625
Oh, and by the way?!

463
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:05,875
It looks like I did rise
from the ashes, bitch!

464
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,208
Oh, geez.

465
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:12,791
Man, that was a close one.

466
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:13,625
Too close.

467
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:15,125
--Move.
--Hey-

468
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:17,833
Now that your pawns are out
of the way, it's your turn.

469
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:20,208
Alright, whatever,
let's do this thing.

470
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:22,541
Damn, you two are still at it?!

471
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:25,333
Oh, so you've finally
decided to play, have you?

472
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:26,500
Well, well.

473
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:28,625
How long can the Crow
stay aloft before

474
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:30,916
plummeting to the ground?

475
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,416
Phoenix, the only
one who's gonna be

476
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,125
hitting the ground is you!

477
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:35,000
Stop it!

478
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:36,583
That's enough of this crap! 

479
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:38,916
Bring it!

480
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:42,125
Dammit, I told you two to stop!

481
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:44,166
Now round up your boys
and get the hell outta here.

482
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:45,875
Because if you don't,
both of you are gonna get

483
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:47,583
a bullet from me.

484
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:49,875
Could you even
shoot that thing, Falcon?

485
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:51,958
That is a tool of
murder you're holding.

486
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:54,750
That's right, and even if you
did have the will to fire it,

487
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:56,250
you might not hit your
target unless you've

488
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:58,041
had quite a bit of practice.

489
00:21:58,125 --> 00:21:59,500
Shut your yap!

490
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:01,625
Now pack up your drum and
all your little goth buddies

491
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:03,208
and just go home.

492
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:04,750
And you!

493
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:06,583
Go to an emergency room for
that bullet in your shoulder!

494
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:08,291
It's gotta be
hurtin' ya' pretty bad!

495
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:10,166
Your little rumble's
been canceled!

496
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:13,625
Falcon. You bastard.

497
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:16,750
I was getting bored anyway.

498
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:17,791
Hey Crow.

499
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:20,333
There'll be
another time, ya' hear?

500
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,958
Yeah, whatever.

501
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:23,375
Morons.

502
00:22:27,708 --> 00:22:30,083
Call an ambulance
for your friend.

503
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,333
That the world may know peace.

504
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:41,750
For the past year, youth-related
crime in Yanagihara

505
00:22:41,833 --> 00:22:43,333
has been at an all-time high.

506
00:22:43,416 --> 00:22:44,875
As a result.

507
00:22:44,958 --> 00:22:46,625
Numerous teens under the age
of eighteen have been arrested

508
00:22:46,708 --> 00:22:49,750
for violence, robbery, and
violations of traffic, drug,

509
00:22:49,833 --> 00:22:50,875
and alcohol laws.

510
00:22:50,958 --> 00:22:52,375
Experts are perplexed as-.

511
00:24:23,041 --> 00:24:25,916
So, Miss Asuka Watarai,
what did you think about

512
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,333
your part in Episode 3?

513
00:24:27,416 --> 00:24:28,333
What part?

514
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:29,666
I was barely
in the thing at all!

515
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:31,541
You're barely in
the next episode, either!

516
00:24:31,625 --> 00:24:33,250
Then why'd you have me
on the show today?

517
00:24:33,333 --> 00:24:36,250
To mess with you while rubbing
in your lack of screen time!
