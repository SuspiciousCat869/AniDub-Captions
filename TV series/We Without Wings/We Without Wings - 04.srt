1
00:00:16,875 --> 00:00:19,583
Today I have a private
meeting with that cute girl.

2
00:00:19,666 --> 00:00:23,041
Some forbidden career advice,
she better take notes!

3
00:00:27,458 --> 00:00:28,791
Who are you?!

4
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:32,541
I'm Hiyoko Tamaizumi.

5
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:35,458
Hope you're ready
for detention!

6
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:40,250
Why study homework
when you could study me?

7
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:43,916
Naru Otori!

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
And, um, I'm Kobato Haneda,
please, stay quiet and behave.

9
00:00:49,208 --> 00:00:52,166
All the naughty lessons learned
here are taught solely by us,

10
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:55,791
the four hottest teachers this
entire school has to offer!

11
00:00:55,875 --> 00:00:57,791
But I only see three of you.

12
00:01:00,375 --> 00:01:02,166
Don't start the lesson early!

13
00:01:05,541 --> 00:01:08,333
Sorryyyyy!

14
00:01:08,416 --> 00:01:10,708
At least she gets
to see the world now.

15
00:01:10,791 --> 00:01:13,208
Teacher Naru,
I fight in your honor.

16
00:01:16,916 --> 00:01:18,000
Now!

17
00:01:18,083 --> 00:01:19,291
Surrender or face
the flames of defeat!

18
00:01:19,375 --> 00:01:21,291
I'm too hot for you to handle!

19
00:01:35,958 --> 00:01:38,041
Don't start
celebrating too early.

20
00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:40,166
There's one hundred and
eight of us teachers in all,

21
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:42,000
and we were the easiest.

22
00:01:46,875 --> 00:01:49,208
Three down, one hundred
and five more to go.

23
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:52,000
I better finish them off
while I have the chance!

24
00:01:53,875 --> 00:01:55,541
The teacher sure is late.

25
00:01:55,625 --> 00:01:57,750
DJ Condor, here! Who
doesn't love making hot,

26
00:01:57,833 --> 00:02:00,458
sexy ladyfriends on the
internet? So convenient!

27
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:02,250
But it still can't beat
coming face-to-face

28
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:04,541
with their godly
gifts! What a treat!

29
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:07,916
It's time for DJ Condor's
"Love Letters From the Ab--"

30
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:56,166
Sorry.

31
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,958
I forgot to mention
I started working at Alexander.

32
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:00,750
Eagle, you dumbass.

33
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:15,125
There she is.

34
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:17,250
'Sup.

35
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:19,416
Been waiting here long?

36
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,666
Change your clothes!

37
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:22,750
Huh?

38
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:24,791
What's wrong with
what I've got on?

39
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:27,416
Man, you sure are
one annoying little kid.

40
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,500
Mind tellin' me what
the hissy fit's all about?

41
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:31,583
You're the one who's
being annoying here, mister!

42
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:34,208
Tonight was supposed to be
the best night of our lives!

43
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:36,625
A night we look for your
bicycle doesn't really seem

44
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:38,291
like that special
of a night to me.

45
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:41,041
It would have been,
if you had only dressed sexy.

46
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:43,333
What?

47
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:44,791
How I've waited for
this moment, to see you

48
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:46,375
in your work clothes,
but instead you greet me

49
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:48,750
with this libido-killing
casual wear!

50
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:51,791
You only care about
your schoolgirl fetish!

51
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:54,875
Yeah, go on and be dramatic,
ya' crazy work clothes lovin',

52
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:57,208
trash talkin',
delusional wench.

53
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:03,041
She's really not gonna
let this thing go.

54
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:07,583
Please forgive me
for being late.

55
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:09,041
Speaking of late.

56
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:11,416
I think that I might just
be pregnant with your baby.

57
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,291
Hey!

58
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:13,250
You can't shake me like that!

59
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:15,083
What would our child think?

60
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:21,708
I know you're happy,
but it was only a joke.

61
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,250
So, where are we headed?

62
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:25,458
Hold up now!

63
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:28,708
As punishment for being late,
you have to hold my hand!

64
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:32,833
Uh, don't you think it's
weird for a girl your age

65
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,708
to be holding hands
with me in public?

66
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:38,625
I I've actually never done it
before, so I don't know.

67
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:41,208
in any case, that's what you've
gotta do to make it up to me,

68
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:43,166
so take it like a man!

69
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,958
Well, guess I've got no choice.

70
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:47,000
Yep, no choice at all!

71
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:50,000
--Drac!
--How's that for a grip?

72
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:52,208
Wonderful, Drac,
just wonderful!

73
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:54,041
Thought you'd say that.

74
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:54,833
So!

75
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:56,083
Let's be on our way then!

76
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:57,708
Hand-in-hand, just like
two lovers should be--

77
00:05:57,791 --> 00:06:00,291
Are ya' tryin to
pull my arm off or somethin'?

78
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:01,708
Hold it right there!

79
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:07,375
Uh.

80
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:08,875
Don't 'uh' me, mister!

81
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:11,500
You knew that I'd see you
walking by what's the big idea,

82
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:14,208
strutting around and
holding hands with Tulip?

83
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:15,625
Tulip?

84
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,833
I stayed in Europe
for a semester!

85
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:21,541
Oh Holland, how I miss your
wooden shoes and old windmills.

86
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:23,041
Ok, but how does
she know anything

87
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:24,416
about you living in Europe?

88
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,750
Because I told her about it.

89
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:27,750
Ya' see, Koda and I
are in the same class.

90
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:31,083
So how is it that the two of
you happen to be aquainted?

91
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:32,333
He's my hubby!

92
00:06:32,416 --> 00:06:33,875
Is that true?!

93
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:36,250
Am I just a little somethin'
somethin' on the side to you?!

94
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:38,791
Koda and I just happen
to know the same people.

95
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:41,125
And for some reason she's
always tryin' to tag along.

96
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:43,250
Tag along my foot,
I'm more to you than that!

97
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:45,666
And don't think I didn't
see you holding hands!

98
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,958
So then, it's true,
what Kazuma said about you

99
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:49,208
making the rounds,

100
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:51,333
that every single night
you party like Marty

101
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:52,875
until the sun comes up!

102
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:54,666
Talk about a nightmare!

103
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,833
Losing my hubby to
a schoolgirl harlot.

104
00:06:57,916 --> 00:06:59,083
You hardly know me wench!

105
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:01,083
Stop trying to ruin my rep?!

106
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:01,958
Nasty!

107
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:03,666
She's like a cute pussy cat!

108
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,125
But does she purr?

109
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:06,875
Quit sneakin' up
like that, Martinez!

110
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:08,958
One of these days you're
gonna give me a heart attack.

111
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:11,125
Why don't you just go back to
peddling all your overpriced

112
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:12,833
trinkets to stupid tourists?

113
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:16,166
I'm here to deliver this special
message: fuck you, ¡pendejo!

114
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,666
That's Martinez.

115
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:18,791
Marty?

116
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:20,791
This is who Drac parties with?!

117
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:22,208
Somebody pinch me. Now!

118
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:24,375
Hey, enough with
the insults, wench

119
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:27,333
You keep talkin' like that and
I'm liable to get pissed off!

120
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:30,125
So you mean the manly work
clothes were just a façade.

121
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:31,125
What are you talkin' about?

122
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:33,750
I'm as manly as they come!

123
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:36,625
Ladies, I assure you that
Drac's a real bad boy,

124
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:38,625
especially in the sack.

125
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:42,583
One of these days I'll meet
someone who knows how

126
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:44,333
to hold a normal conversa-

127
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:46,500
Friends become friends.

128
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:48,083
Because they like.

129
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:49,208
Alice?

130
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:50,458
How long have you
been sittin' there?

131
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:54,166
Drac don't become
happy downstairs with men.

132
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,291
Did you hear that?

133
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:56,750
She knows.

134
00:07:56,833 --> 00:08:01,083
Drac doesn't know happiness
and love except for kids.

135
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:02,500
Time to play our games.

136
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:04,541
Touch hands then
remove clothing,

137
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:06,625
strip rock-paper-scissors!

138
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:10,583
My body is for you, Drac.

139
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:13,500
I will say yes
to all of Drac's desires!

140
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:16,291
So you party with
Marty and pigtailed Penny!

141
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:18,250
Wahhh, my sweet Drac is
actually a naughty predator!

142
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:19,750
Once you're through
this child phase,

143
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,041
I'll be ready and waiting!

144
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,416
All desires, Drac,
all desires!

145
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,458
Shaddup, ya damn wenches!

146
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:27,958
Ready?

147
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:29,041
Huh?

148
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:31,333
Tulip is really
Kakeru's little sister?

149
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:32,750
For cryin' out loud!

150
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:34,916
Is it really that hard
to call her by her real name?

151
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,833
Oh, is it OK if
I call you Naru, Tulip?

152
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:40,375
Sure, Miss Koda, if that's
what you want to do .

153
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:41,458
Naru it is!

154
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:44,250
And from now on,
go ahead and call me Ai!

155
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:46,583
Um Ai.

156
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:47,833
Just like that!

157
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:50,791
As for you, you're just
gonna go by Hayato.

158
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:51,791
My name.

159
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:55,208
That could work
Hay-yah-toh, huh?

160
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:57,250
Hayato!

161
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:58,833
Hayato.

162
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:00,875
Hayato, Hayato!

163
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:04,791
Naru, you sound like a parrot!

164
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:06,166
Isn't that right, Hayato?

165
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,750
Well you sound like a banshee!

166
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:09,708
Hayato, don't you agree?

167
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,916
What do we got goin' on here?

168
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,791
Would ya look at that,
it's our homeboy, Hayato!

169
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:17,416
Dang 'sup, playa?!

170
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,958
Playa indeed,
that's Ai and lil Naru!

171
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:22,000
Once the chicks bounce,
you wanna light up?

172
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:24,500
Yeah, he got a blonde broad
and the boss's little sis,

173
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:26,958
just waiting for the right
time to steal a little kiss,

174
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:29,625
Two fine chicas with the man
of the hour, A little grope,

175
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:31,875
a little foreplay,
it's time to deflower!

176
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:33,000
Oh Drac, yes Drac!

177
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:34,541
Right there's the spot-

178
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:35,458
Harassment!

179
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,166
Respect the artistry!

180
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,291
Morisato, hey,
you seem like a nice guy.

181
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:41,125
Can you go ahead and
take this girl home?

182
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:42,416
And go get yourself a haircut.

183
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,500
Huh?

184
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,083
Hey, what're you
trying to pull, Hayato?

185
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:48,166
It's too bad you'll be leaving
us alone the rest of the night!

186
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,125
Wait a minute, what makes
you think you got the right

187
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:51,458
to tell me what to do?

188
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:53,458
I thought you were
her guardian or somethin'?

189
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:54,833
Don't make me vomit!

190
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:57,458
Kazu's nothing to me,
just a childhood friend.

191
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:00,458
'Sides, me an' the
boys were just about to

192
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:02,541
start off one hell
of a party, bro!

193
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:03,750
Ain't that right?

194
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:06,625
Please don't tell me
you guys are still

195
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:09,041
goin' at it with
those R-Wing freaks.

196
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:11,708
Hell, no, those pansies,
they went and turned tail,

197
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:14,291
hoisted that white flag
and suckers set sail!

198
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:16,916
Yeah, yo, check it Fool!

199
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,125
You remember that fruitcake from
the other day, the Archbishop?

200
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:21,958
You know, the one who got
his girly ass stomped

201
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:23,416
on by the boss!

202
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,708
Word on the street is
that he left the hospital.

203
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,375
Done gone checked out!

204
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:29,166
So what better thing
for the YFB to do

205
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,750
than track the clown down?!

206
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:33,125
Nothing like the thrill
of the hunt, 'm I right?!

207
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:35,708
So while we're out having
a grand ol' time, we wish you

208
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:39,166
and the girls the best of
luck finding that bicycle!

209
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,333
--Take it easy.
--See ya!

210
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:43,166
Catch ya' on the flip
side! Later, bro.

211
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:46,458
Men can be such idiots;
why are they like that?

212
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:49,875
I have no idea, but my
brother always seems to be

213
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:52,458
causing trouble around town.

214
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:56,166
So that weirdo escaped
from the hospital, huh?

215
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,750
Well, no big deal.

216
00:10:57,833 --> 00:11:01,166
Not like he's gonna be able to
do anything to Kakeru, anyway.

217
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,166
Psst! Hey!

218
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,791
Huh What's up?

219
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:07,250
I got an idea, honey bun!

220
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,708
Let's hit the web!

221
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:12,166
Geez, we paid for three
people. You'd think that

222
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,750
they could at least give
us a little more space.

223
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:16,750
People usually come
to these cafés alone,

224
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:18,666
so this is a normal size booth.

225
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:23,833
Yep, here we are at the
official homepage of R-wing.

226
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:26,916
Sweet, thanks, though I
don't understand why a gang

227
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,375
would have their own website
out in the open like this.

228
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:30,875
Well, works out for us!

229
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:32,875
Look at all the
info it's got here!

230
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:34,083
Yeah, I guess.

231
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:36,916
Huh, how about that!

232
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,958
You know how to use a computer.

233
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:41,875
Of course I know how to use
one. All it takes is killin'

234
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:43,333
a little time
playin' video games

235
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:44,666
in the electronics stores.

236
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,625
Oh Hayato, you're such
an adorable geeky-pooh.

237
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,791
It makes my
heart skip a beat!

238
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,375
Cut it out, wench!

239
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:54,083
Real men like me don't even have
an adorable side, you got it?

240
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:58,041
Don't worry, Hayato!

241
00:11:58,125 --> 00:11:59,583
You've got me to teach you!

242
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:01,416
I'm pretty sure that I know how
to use a mouse, ya' dingbat!

243
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,291
Let's move the cursor,
up and down!

244
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:03,833
Hey!

245
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:04,833
Quit it!

246
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:07,791
Left to the right,
just like so!

247
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:09,541
Have you no sense of decency?!

248
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:12,666
Stop it, stop it right now,
you dirty scheming ho-bag!

249
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,666
Desperate for
attention, are we?

250
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:15,875
Hey, Koda.

251
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:17,083
Something hard's
hittin' the back of my head.

252
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:18,916
Kinda painful.

253
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,166
Ai, don't tell me
you're padding your b-

254
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:25,500
--Rub-a-rub rub, Dracky wacky!
--Heystop!

255
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:26,916
What the hell do you
think your doin'?!

256
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,250
My goodness!

257
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:30,250
The nerve of that whore,
now she's not even trying

258
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,333
to pretend like
she's teaching him!

259
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:34,833
If that's the way you
wanna play it, sister slut!

260
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:36,375
 Wheeeee!

261
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:38,958
It's time for your very own
private lesson from Miss Otori!

262
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:40,125
Whoa, wait a minute.

263
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:41,333
Do you really have
to be wigglin' around

264
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:43,166
on my lap like that?

265
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:44,958
Should I take that as
a roundabout way of you

266
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:47,083
saying that you like it
and want me to keep going?

267
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:49,583
Well Naru, 
I underestimated you.

268
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:51,416
You're good,
but not good enough!

269
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,541
Bansai!

270
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:54,166
Right here's the page down key,

271
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,500
for when you want
to go down quickly...

272
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:57,375
...for when you want to
finish up quick and dirty!

273
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:59,625
Tab will thrust your
cursor forward and deeper

274
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:01,000
until it reaches the end.

275
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:02,166
Let's try it out!

276
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:07,291
Too much?

277
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:20,250
Naru, what do you think?

278
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:20,916
Huh?

279
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,250
Mmmm, it could work.

280
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:25,500
Time to finally get this done.

281
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:30,250
That Archbishop guy is really
workin' to rally his troops.

282
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:32,750
Sure doesn't look
like it did him much good.

283
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:35,416
No gang member wants
a leader who's been defeated.

284
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:40,041
He's been kicked out of the
gang, and lost all of his goons.

285
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:42,041
Doubt we even need
to worry about him.

286
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,083
Sorry for the holdup.

287
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:46,625
I'm all done with my re-

288
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:57,250
You're such a pervert,
Sneaking up on us this way!

289
00:13:57,333 --> 00:13:58,875
What's going on in here?

290
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:01,500
Naru said you have a fetish
for schoolgirl uniforms,

291
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:03,583
so I thought we could
swap clothes for a bit.

292
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:05,000
And she's a lyin' harlot.

293
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:06,375
Please!

294
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:09,083
Just turn around and go back,
you sexual predator!

295
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:10,833
Fine whatever, sorry.

296
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:14,791
What's this?

297
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:17,083
Don't tell me
I forgot to remove my pads!

298
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:19,291
So that's what poked me
in the back of my head.

299
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:20,875
Please, please,
just hand it back to me!

300
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:22,250
No, throw it away or burn it!

301
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:24,166
Clutching it longingly means
you're only confirming

302
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,416
the warmth of
Ai's soft, supple skin!

303
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,458
Hey now!

304
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:31,458
Excuse me, dear customers?

305
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:34,041
Please refrain from
partaking in sexual activity

306
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:35,666
while using our store.

307
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:42,875
That the world may know peace.

308
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:52,541
Time to put in
a good day of hard work!

309
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,291
Let's do this!

310
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:58,333
Beautiful day
outside, you guys!

311
00:14:58,416 --> 00:14:59,416
What's happening?

312
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:06,916
Oh?

313
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,250
Good morning, Hiyoko.

314
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:10,458
Good morning
to you too, Chitose.

315
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:15,208
She's so cute.

316
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:17,333
Say, did you need
any help with that box?

317
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,208
No thanks, I've got it.

318
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:20,958
You sure about that?

319
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:22,250
Almost got it!

320
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:25,041
Oh, so close,
just a little more lift!

321
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,500
Huh?

322
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:38,000
Uh, careful!

323
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:42,875
Should I hold
the chair for you?

324
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:45,041
No, I can handle this myself.

325
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:46,333
Come on, it's no trouble.

326
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:47,875
I'll just hold it steady!

327
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:57,250
Ow, man, hmm?

328
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:58,291
Now what could that be?

329
00:15:58,375 --> 00:15:59,541
Is that beige?

330
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:02,875
 Hey! Just what do you
think you're doing?!

331
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:04,708
Woah! My bad!

332
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:06,500
I didn't realize
that they were your panties!

333
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:09,041
No more poking,
I'm terribly sorry!

334
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:17,208
Huh?

335
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,708
I'm not exactly sure what I
should think of everything

336
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:23,625
that just happened here.

337
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:27,833
But all that aside, thank you
for trying to help me, Chitose.

338
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:29,291
I mean it.

339
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,000
Are you happy?

340
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:36,666
Thank you for your business!

341
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:42,000
So how about it, Shu, have you
taken a fancy to Tamaizumi?

342
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:45,125
Oh Kakeru, always saying
such silly things!

343
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:46,666
Is that so?

344
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:49,583
I mean, I think you have been
staring at her a whole lot.

345
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:51,958
You're better off not
falling in love with her, man;

346
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:54,583
some people only like the
challenge of going for someone.

347
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:56,916
Once they finally have them,
they just get bored.

348
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:57,708
Hmm?

349
00:16:57,791 --> 00:16:59,250
You describing me or her?

350
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:00,208
You.

351
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:10,583
That's a pretty intense
stare he's got goin' on.

352
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:12,458
Wonder if he knows
Kakeru or something.

353
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:14,500
Why hello, Kakeru!

354
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:16,791
I was flippin' through a muscle
mag and found a hairstyle

355
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:19,041
that'd look perfect on you!

356
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:21,291
Shut up and quit
touching me, ya hear?

357
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:22,166
Wah!

358
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,416
Kakeru, you're such a meanie!

359
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:27,458
I'm heading out, Shu.

360
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:28,541
I'll catch you later.

361
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:30,000
Really?

362
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:32,208
Don't tell me you're gonna
up and leave just like that!

363
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:36,458
Damn bitch,
you're asking for it.

364
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:40,958
Heh, sorry guess I got your
shoulder pretty good there, huh?

365
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:41,958
Kakeru?

366
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:43,458
You feeling ok, buddy?

367
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:45,291
Y-yeah, is everything alrigh-

368
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:47,875
I thought I told you
not to touch me!

369
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:49,666
Are you deaf,
you stupid whore?!

370
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,375
Kakeru.

371
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,625
Forgive me, Eriko.

372
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:02,000
Please forget that
this ever happened.

373
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:07,000
You see that, Chitose?

374
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:11,291
Heh Kakeru's a funny guy,
and now he owes me one!

375
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:13,958
Well, how's that for
a random violent outburst?!

376
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:15,208
As a peace lover,

377
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:17,250
I'm finding this very
uncomfortable right now!

378
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:19,125
Show a little more sympathy.

379
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:21,791
He's been acting that way
for three days now, at least.

380
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:24,375
Eriko, I'm sure you get
how he feels, right?

381
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:25,875
Time to get back to work!

382
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:26,750
Hmm.

383
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:28,250
Guess Kakeru really was hurt.

384
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:29,875
That explains his sour mood.

385
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:34,166
Excuse me, sir!

386
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,541
I don't mean to be a bother,

387
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:37,666
but I think you must've
forgotten to pay your bill.

388
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:38,375
The bill?

389
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:40,000
Oh, right, sorry.

390
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:42,291
It's you!

391
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:42,958
But why?!

392
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:44,500
Come again?

393
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:45,000
Hey, wait!

394
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:46,083
Chitose!

395
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:47,625
He's trying to
leave without paying!

396
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:49,708
Hold on, Hiyoko!

397
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:51,708
Stay away from me!

398
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:54,041
Please, just hurry up and
get the money he owes us,

399
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:55,833
and we can get back to work!

400
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:00,083
Well, duking things
out has never really been

401
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:02,458
my forte but here goes.

402
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,708
So is this how Hayato did it?

403
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:07,125
You want a piece
of me, asshole?!

404
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:12,416
Hiyoko, watch out!

405
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:15,750
Chitose!

406
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:17,000
Chitose, are you all right?!

407
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:19,041
Please answer me Chitose!

408
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:20,583
--This is all my fault!
--It's ok Hiyoko.

409
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:24,291
--Chitose! Can you hear me?!
--This is where he comes in.

410
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:25,500
Please say something!

411
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:27,041
Chitose!

412
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:30,875
What the hell?

413
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:31,583
Shit.

414
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:32,875
Where'd that come from?

415
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:33,875
Chitose!

416
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:34,958
Thank goodness
you're all right!

417
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:38,333
Shut up and
stay out of my way.

418
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:39,625
So it was you.

419
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:42,000
Die!

420
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:44,291
Bring it,
you stupid little prick.

421
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:00,541
I won't forget this!

422
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:05,000
Stay right there!

423
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:08,125
Just wash the head wound
with water and disinfect it.

424
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:10,875
This ain't worth seein'
a doctor about, got it?

425
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:12,791
Um got it!

426
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:15,416
Hurry up and get back
to the cockpit, Eagle.

427
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,666
Dammit.

428
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:31,375
I'm back.

429
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:47,041
Good morning!

430
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:49,583
It's not all too often that I
get a meeting request from you!

431
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:51,416
How can I be
of service this fine day?

432
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,750
Don't try playin' dumb with me,

433
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:55,416
asshole you know
exactly why you're here.

434
00:20:56,958 --> 00:21:00,041
So tell me, Hayato, who's
manning the cockpit right now?

435
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:02,333
Nobody is, ya' jackass.

436
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:03,666
Is that so.

437
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,333
So what was is it you needed?

438
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:07,458
I need you to not cause
a ruckus over something

439
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:09,166
as minor as some dough.

440
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:10,083
Bingo!

441
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:11,458
I figured that was it.

442
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:13,416
That ain't the only thing.

443
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,708
You went out
and got a job, too.

444
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:17,916
You're the one who said we
needed to avoid set schedules

445
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,458
and gigs with
regular work hours.

446
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:22,583
True, but hey,
can you blame me?

447
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:26,833
A guy has to make a living
from time to time, doesn't he?

448
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:28,166
Really, though.

449
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:30,416
I've had a lot of scrambles
to deal with myself,

450
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,208
no thanks to Takashi
and his Gretagard stuff.

451
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:35,250
I've lost track of all the
times I've been tossed into

452
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:36,833
the cockpit on account of him.

453
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:39,041
It's Takashi during
the day, you at night,

454
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:40,375
and me for the late nights.

455
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:42,083
Didn't we already settle this?

456
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:45,083
Well, he's got his own set
of problems, right?

457
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:48,375
He does have the most
difficult role, after all.

458
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:51,541
In any case, this arrangement
provides the most balance.

459
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:53,875
So don't go causing
any more problems.

460
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:56,291
Aye aye, captain!
Read you loud and clear!

461
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:58,000
So, I guess that
concludes today's meeting.

462
00:21:58,083 --> 00:21:59,250
I'll be seeing you around!

463
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:00,166
Later!

464
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:01,500
Shit.

465
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:25,291
Ow ow ow ow ow,
that Yokujin soldier's

466
00:22:25,375 --> 00:22:28,125
blow to the head still
hasn't quite healed up.

467
00:22:28,208 --> 00:22:31,958
I musn't let my guard
down so carelessly.

468
00:22:32,041 --> 00:22:35,000
So that's the basics,
more or less.

469
00:22:35,083 --> 00:22:37,916
Though let's have
a little review, shall we?

470
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:45,500
Hawk, Eagle and Falcon and- hey,
I haven't lost you yet, have I?

471
00:22:45,583 --> 00:22:49,375
It's a story of plight,
and of birds without flight.

472
00:22:49,458 --> 00:22:50,875
What do you know, a rhyme!

473
00:24:23,166 --> 00:24:26,583
The daytime hawk, evening
eagle, and late night falcon!

474
00:24:26,666 --> 00:24:28,458
Call it three birds
with one stone!

475
00:24:28,541 --> 00:24:29,583
Or one boy, rather!

476
00:24:29,666 --> 00:24:30,916
What a twist!

477
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,583
But I bet most of you ruined
this great reveal by

478
00:24:32,666 --> 00:24:35,125
going online and coming
