1
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,500
I'm sorry, Yoji, I am.

2
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:18,583
I really mean it.

3
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:25,791
Get the hell away from me,
you little thief!

4
00:00:28,916 --> 00:00:33,083
You're her older brother, Yoji;
you have to protect Kobato.

5
00:00:36,416 --> 00:00:37,666
Why?! Why?!

6
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:40,500
Why do you always want
to be so close to her?!

7
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:44,750
You really do love
your sister, don't you?

8
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:47,791
The two of you
get along so well.

9
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:49,625
Screw you, you little brat!

10
00:00:49,708 --> 00:00:51,875
Stop it, mommy!
It's not Birdy's fault!

11
00:00:51,958 --> 00:00:55,166
She didn't do anything!
Quit picking on her!

12
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:58,208
Stop! Please, mommy!
Sto-o-o-p!

13
00:01:19,583 --> 00:01:22,708
Uh- are you ok?

14
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:27,500
Mother. She must've
had a weak mind, too.

15
00:01:27,583 --> 00:01:32,625
After a while she just couldn't
stand living with dad anymore.

16
00:01:32,708 --> 00:01:35,958
The problem was, she still
saw some of him in Yoji.

17
00:01:36,041 --> 00:01:39,833
Why are you still clinging
to her, you pervert?!

18
00:01:39,916 --> 00:01:41,583
That's why she
always hated seeing you,

19
00:01:41,666 --> 00:01:43,833
the daughter of her brother, and
her son - more importantly,

20
00:01:43,916 --> 00:01:47,458
her husband's son -
become so close.

21
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:55,458
Shall we move on?

22
00:01:55,541 --> 00:01:58,750
Wait! It's ok;
you don't have to do this.

23
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:12,625
On the day I lost Gretagard,
I finally met the other

24
00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:17,375
two personalities inside me, and
they told me why I was born.

25
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:20,916
I am someone's replacement.

26
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,125
Yoji Haneda had locked
himself away in Naraku.

27
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:27,833
The one to replace him
was to be strong, and kind,

28
00:02:27,916 --> 00:02:32,958
able to always see the
light: me, Takashi Haneda.

29
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:35,333
But, like Yoji,
I too had many flaws.

30
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:37,500
When this world became
too much for me to handle,

31
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:39,833
I would flee to the world
of Gretagard, the setting

32
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:43,166
of a game I grew up playing.
I created two friends to help

33
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:47,833
in my cause, there was the
high spirited Shusuke Chitose,

34
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:52,083
and the tough-as-nails
Hayato Narita.

35
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:55,083
Neither one was thrilled about
helping me bring back Yoji,

36
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:58,208
nor confronting the past to
do so, but they ultimately

37
00:02:58,291 --> 00:03:02,250
came around for Kobato's
sake, if nothing else.

38
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:07,500
Where to now?

39
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:08,916
Back home?

40
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,333
Do you think you could
go on a little farther?

41
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:16,000
Of course, but may I ask what
the point is? Just curious.

42
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:18,416
I think you can see
where I'm coming from.

43
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,375
After all, your sister Naru-

44
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:25,916
Oopsie. This ain't my van
so the steering's taking

45
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,208
some getting used to.

46
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:29,875
Uh- that's fine.
No problem at all.

47
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:32,416
Like I said, the fact
that you have a sister too-

48
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:35,583
Wow, these tires
have no traction!

49
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:38,958
We're sliding all over!
Fasten your seatbelts!

50
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:45,333
It hasn't changed a bit!

51
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:53,458
This church is-

52
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,416
Why me?

53
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:08,458
Why do you continue
doing these things?

54
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:12,583
Who keeps trying
to push us around? Who?

55
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:13,833
That was my life.

56
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:16,666
Always wanting to cry,
slowly falling apart.

57
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,750
I thought I was going crazy.

58
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:21,875
All I ever wanted was
for someone to save me.

59
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:35,208
Through it all, there was
someone who was so dear to me,

60
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:36,750
I had to protect her!

61
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:40,541
Tune out that static, little
man! You don't need that noise!

62
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:44,291
Forget about it! You don't have
to deal with that anymore!

63
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:47,000
It's over, don't you remember?!

64
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:58,833
My mother, she isn't-
She's gone now.

65
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:00,208
Well, um-

66
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:04,333
It's all my fault,
for what I did to her.

67
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:07,333
No one will ever forgive me
for what I've done.

68
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:11,916
It's impossible.
I have to get out of here!

69
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:18,500
That's why I ran away,
to forget about my past.

70
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:21,833
I didn't want to remember.

71
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:24,208
I did a truly terrible thing.

72
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:28,125
Exile in Naraku,
that was my punishment.

73
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:30,000
I hate it in Naraku.

74
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:33,458
The only thing I ever wanted was
to be just like everybody else.

75
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,041
This is for the best.

76
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:38,875
I can erase all my memories and
spend the rest of my life here.

77
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:41,250
Always watching Dream TV.

78
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:43,750
See? This isn't so bad.

79
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:48,541
Ker-chunk! Showtime!

80
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:56,125
J-JO Me-X TV.
L-live from Naraku.

81
00:05:56,208 --> 00:06:00,708
H-Haneda is awful- oops,
I mean Haneda is awesome!

82
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:07,000
That the world may know peace.

83
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:11,958
That the world may know peace,
that the world may know peace.

84
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:14,166
That the world may know
peace, So that the world

85
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:17,416
may know peace!

86
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,000
Kobato.

87
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:21,583
This is the old church where we
met the priest who took us in

88
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:25,166
and cared for us when we
were kids. You remember?

89
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,750
A priest?

90
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:32,291
Yes, I remember.

91
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:35,708
The priest told the two of us
to never forget that phrase

92
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:39,500
because it would grant us the
kindness to forgive anything.

93
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:43,416
But my mother is-
she's somewhere else,

94
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,166
a place where she
can't forgive anymore.

95
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:49,000
What's this?

96
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:51,708
It's from the priest.
He asked me to hold onto it,

97
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:55,833
until you chose
to remember again.

98
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:59,083
A suicide?

99
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:02,208
But didn't I? I thought-

100
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:04,916
Her injuries healed.

101
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,083
But you know, I honestly
don't think that your mother

102
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:11,458
ever meant to stay here in this
world as long as she did.

103
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:13,833
So then.

104
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:15,375
Still.

105
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:18,333
That still doesn't
change what I did to her.

106
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,666
It's ok.

107
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,875
You were only trying to look
out for your little sister.

108
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:33,416
And if it hadn't been
for you, I might not have

109
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:37,041
ever made it as far
as I did, or at all!

110
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:40,458
Now, I have my very
own wings to guide me!

111
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:46,958
That the world may know peace.

112
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:52,250
I know that you can do it,
big brother.

113
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:56,500
You have the kindness to
forgive anything. So please.

114
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:59,208
Now's the time to
forgive yourself!

115
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,000
Hey Kobato!

116
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:29,666
Oh, hello Akira.

117
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:33,750
How's your morning? Let's
start heading to schoo-

118
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:36,041
Oh, this here's my big brother!

119
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:38,291
Hello there! You two go
to the same school?

120
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:41,791
U -uhh, yes! My name's
Akira, Akira Kikkawa!

121
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:43,708
Gotcha. Consider me a friend.

122
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:48,291
Oh, um, well why? I mean!
Yes! Kobato talks about you,

123
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:51,166
she says you're great!
It makes me so jealous,

124
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,250
I wish I could have an older
brother that was kind

125
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,000
and handsome just like you!

126
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:56,625
Wait. Seriously?

127
00:08:58,083 --> 00:09:00,166
We better go, alright?

128
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,666
Sounds good. See you later!

129
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:10,791
Later on in the day, I -- I
mean, we -- made a decision.

130
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:14,125
Nothing too major, but I still
thought it was a good idea.

131
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:20,083
I wanted to tell all of
our friends everything.

132
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:23,375
If anyone deserved to know
the truth, it was them.

133
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,458
Lemme get this straight, a set
of hot twins wants to bang me?

134
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:32,750
I didn't say that!

135
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:35,375
I'm joking, sadly.

136
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:37,958
But that's a pretty messed-up
story you just told us .

137
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:39,500
I know it is.

138
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,916
Let's recap: You were caught
standing in front of a mirror

139
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,041
wearing Hiyoko's outfit spouting
kinky obscenities to yourself

140
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:46,500
and it weirded
the girls out, right?

141
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:48,708
Were you even
listening to me ?!

142
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:52,416
Don't worry kid, I get it.

143
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,250
So I guess you'll be seeking
some treatment now, huh?

144
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:57,833
Nah. I pretty much have
it under control,

145
00:09:57,916 --> 00:09:59,291
so I think that I'm
going to hold off

146
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:00,791
until after graduation.

147
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:02,541
I see. Best of luck.

148
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:04,083
Thank you very much.

149
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:06,416
Studies show that more than
sixty percent of Japanese men

150
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,541
have excessive foreskin.
So never feel ashamed

151
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:10,000
of your body. Never.

152
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:11,833
What the hell do you think
I'm getting treatment for?!

153
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:13,041
Just thought I'd let
you know before you

154
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:14,500
make any rash decisions.

155
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:16,083
Thanks but no thanks!

156
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:18,125
And should you meet any female
medical professionals who have

157
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:20,500
difficulty performing their
duties due to insatiable

158
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:22,208
carnal desire,
tell me right away.

159
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:23,833
Someone make it stop!

160
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,833
You said you're
different on the inside,

161
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:28,500
but how can we
be sure about that?

162
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:29,750
Yeah, good point!

163
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:32,500
So, you mean, you still
have Shusuke's memories?

164
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:35,250
I remember everything,
it's all been consolidated.

165
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:37,541
You ruin parties,
and you suck at tests-

166
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:39,458
That'll be enough
outta you, jerkwad!

167
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:40,750
Sock it to him good!

168
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:43,000
Don't worry, you're way
below your quota!

169
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:45,875
Eeesh, it hurts twice as much
when there's just one of me!

170
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:51,083
I'm glad that's over with.

171
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:54,250
Hey, thanks for
all your help today.

172
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:57,083
So how about letting me talk
to Karura for a minute?

173
00:10:57,166 --> 00:11:02,916
Uh, let's see. Your king
has returned once again!

174
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,041
That was weak.

175
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:07,916
Was it? Fear not,
my faithful subject.

176
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,708
I am here to lead you
into battle!

177
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:10,416
Pathetic.

178
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,916
That one too?

179
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,458
Just let me know
if Karura ever returns.

180
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:17,458
In the meantime, maybe
consider some acting classes.

181
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:29,166
So, are you done
working until you graduate?

182
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,625
Huh?

183
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:32,916
You're always welcome. We
can help keep an eye on you

184
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,208
at all times, ensuring
your youthful sex drive

185
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:36,916
is under control
during work hours.

186
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,875
And I thought I had problems?!

187
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:49,916
Well damn, so you're actually
crazier than I thought you were.

188
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,291
Speaking of, I think it's
time for me to close up shop

189
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:54,625
as a fixer.
Got other commitments.

190
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:55,958
Whatever you think is best.

191
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:58,458
Making good grades should
technically be your job.

192
00:11:58,541 --> 00:11:59,833
Hit those books!

193
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:03,166
Right! Thank you for all the
support you've given me.

194
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,583
Never thought I'd live
to see Drac bow to me.

195
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:09,750
I might even shed a tear!
So, this is for you.

196
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:12,083
Go ahead, take it!

197
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:15,083
Huh? Um, but I'm done
doing contract work.

198
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:18,125
Now don't you go
giving me any lip, kid!

199
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:20,541
You may say that you're
Yoji Haneda, but who cares,

200
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:23,250
to me you'll always
be grumpy ol' Drac.

201
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:26,291
That is, unless you changed your
name and made up that story

202
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:28,583
in order to get off the hook
for everything you've owed me

203
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:31,791
since we've known
each other. Ya' got me?

204
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,083
Yup!

205
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:38,750
The truth is simple. Your
memory is unable to forget

206
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:42,375
this beautiful, sexy and sultry
body you want to ravage.

207
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:44,083
Woah there,
you've got it all wrong.

208
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:46,458
I'm not into young
children like that, ok?

209
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:50,291
Nope. You could barely control
little Drac. I remember.

210
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:52,875
Peeking below my dress
made you so happy!

211
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:56,000
Hey hey hey, put that skirt back
down you messed-up little kid!

212
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:57,208
Where are your parents?!

213
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:58,958
Who's looking after
this troubled youth?!

214
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:00,083
Someone take care of this cr-

215
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:01,500
Relax, hon.

216
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:04,166
Strange, today you're
acting a little different.

217
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,041
I mean, I always liked the
tough guy act, but this pure

218
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:10,083
and innocent getup is
equally hard to resist!

219
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:11,958
I can't wait
to unleash your inner ho.

220
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:15,666
Thanks, but for some reason, I
already feel terribly violated.

221
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,000
That's the idea.

222
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:20,500
Uh, I think I'll pass!
Uh, I'm sorry.

223
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:22,833
Ah, that's ok.

224
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,375
It's not surprising that
many can't wrap their heads

225
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:33,750
around the situation. It's
hard to explain, after all.

226
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:36,500
But it wouldn't be right
to keep secrets from them,

227
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:39,583
the very people who were
kind enough to accept us.

228
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:41,958
I probably could have gone
about telling them the truth

229
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:44,333
a little better in retrospect,

230
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:46,458
but at least
there's just one left.

231
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:49,916
Please forgive me- wha?

232
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,500
I think that I must have
accidentally bumped into you.

233
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,708
Good morning sir- mmph!

234
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:58,416
Are you alright?

235
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:02,458
I'm fine! Never
felt bett- mmph!

236
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,250
And you're sure
that you're doing ok?

237
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:06,750
Oh yes, I'm doing quite well
thank you, don't worry about it!

238
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:08,958
Come on now,
be honest with me.

239
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:11,375
An older woman once told me
that I should always do my best

240
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:13,791
to "fake it until I make it."

241
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:15,166
That's pretty clever!

242
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,750
I thought so. You should
definitely try it sometime.

243
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:20,333
Actually. I've already tried
faking it with my friends,

244
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:21,916
but it doesn't really work.

245
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:25,750
Is something wrong?

246
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:28,166
Kind of. I have to tell
someone something that's

247
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,708
both important
and a little weird.

248
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:32,250
Ah.

249
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:35,083
I don't know how they'll react,
so that's making me nervous.

250
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:37,916
Truth be told it's
a pretty pathetic story.

251
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,250
N-no, that's not
pathetic at all!

252
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:41,791
Hmm?

253
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:43,916
Because now and then everyone
runs into that same problem,

254
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,166
wanting to say something
with all your heart,

255
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:50,041
having trouble finding the
courage to do so. But you?

256
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:53,208
You'll find that courage,
I'm sure of it.

257
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:01,833
Thank you, miss,
miss whatever your name is.

258
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:06,125
Ohmigosh Ohmigosh Ohmigosh!
You figured yourself out!

259
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:07,541
That's seriously amazing!

260
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:09,166
Like putting together a
puzzle with a jillion pieces!

261
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,750
It's even harder than arching
your back like a rainbow!

262
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:13,083
How did your
spiritual pilgrimage go,

263
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:14,791
my timid little grasshopper?

264
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:16,166
How'd you find out about that?

265
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,583
Let's just say a certain
chicken let a few clucks

266
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:21,833
escape his beak.

267
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:24,250
Everything went well.
I can even tell you all about

268
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:26,916
little sister moé now
if you're still interested.

269
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,083
I've actually lost my
interest in that topic.

270
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:30,666
Huh? How come?

271
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:33,708
It was originally a competition
I had going with the chicken,

272
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:36,708
but he's into the "extreme."
Unlike him, I'm not quite

273
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:40,375
willing to pick at
"forbidden fruit." heh.

274
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:42,125
Don't tell me you mean-

275
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:46,333
Yeah, you guessed it
alright. Chicken is into-

276
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:48,416
Real little sister moé!

277
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:52,083
So, what are your future
plans? Anything special?

278
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:53,583
How 'bout a vacation?
The weather's great!

279
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:55,125
Perfect for the beach!
You like to swim?! I do!

280
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:57,083
I'm a freestyle phenom! My lung
capacity's like a whale's!

281
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:58,458
We could swim straight
across the world,

282
00:15:58,541 --> 00:15:59,833
make a yearlong trip of it!
Ever built a snowman?!

283
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:01,666
Well now "Yukon" in Canada!
See I'm well-read too!

284
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,250
You won't even need
a tour guide when

285
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:05,125
you're with Miyako Yamashina,
a girl ripe with information!

286
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:06,083
I'm ripe in other
ways too, you know!

287
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:07,791
Um, I better get to class.

288
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:11,416
Your last manuscript
was well-received.

289
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,500
In most cases I'd have you
jump into the next one,

290
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:15,625
but with your situation
being what it is.

291
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:16,958
I'm sorry.

292
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:18,958
Yeah, well, let me know
when you're feeling ready

293
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:21,750
to work on another project.
You're a great writer.

294
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:23,250
At least I think so.

295
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:24,666
Thanks so much for everything.

296
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,916
Right. I'll be waiting!

297
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,875
Surprise!

298
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:31,250
Oh, hey. How are
you doing, Masako?

299
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:33,375
Is something wrong?
Why the long face?

300
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:36,250
What- Everything is just fine!
In fact my morale's about

301
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:37,625
to burst through the roof!

302
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:40,000
That's good. As long as
we're walking the same way,

303
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:41,583
wanna go to school together?

304
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:43,416
I would, but I've actually got
to go make a pretty important

305
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,458
phone call right now.

306
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:46,041
Really? Who do you
think you are,

307
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:47,416
some bigshot CEO?

308
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,416
I'm sorry, but I really
don't have time to waste

309
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,583
explaining it to you.

310
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:52,458
Well damn, I guess
you're being serious.

311
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:55,333
Gosh, you're so wound up.
It's actually kind of cute.

312
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:56,958
What the hell are
you talking about?

313
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:58,875
I'm not wound up! I'm just
really uncomfortable

314
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:00,875
around you?!

315
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:04,250
Right. You go ahead make that
call. I'll leave you alone now.

316
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:05,791
Till next time.

317
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:13,125
All right.

318
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:18,791
H-h-hello?! Morisato?!
Can you hear me?!

319
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:21,250
It's me, Yoji Haneda! Say
something if you're there!

320
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:23,250
Hey. Calm down, moron?

321
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,333
Sorry we haven't
talked in so long.

322
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:27,000
What's it been,
since freshman year?

323
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:29,875
Hayato and I actually saw
each other quite a bit.

324
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:31,291
Kakeru told me the news.

325
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:33,833
I'm not sure that I really
get it, but you've unified

326
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:35,458
or whatever it's called, right?

327
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:37,125
Yeah, that's exactly it!

328
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:39,583
I guess you really have
been a spectacular friend.

329
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:41,208
Not so fast.

330
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:43,291
I never wanted to
hang out with you, man.

331
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:46,333
I was just keepin' an eye out
'cause Kakeru asked me to.

332
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:48,208
How we started
out's not important.

333
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:50,208
You know how in manga the
guy and the girl who can't

334
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:52,458
stand each other get thrown
together into an adventure

335
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:55,291
and eventually become lovers?
We're kind of like that.

336
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:58,291
The hell?! That's
messed up. Seriously.

337
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:01,250
Look, I consider you to be
a very good friend, Kazuma.

338
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:04,416
And so, if you don't feel
the same way that I do.

339
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,500
I'll just double down
on my affections!

340
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:09,083
The way I feel about you will
be enough for the both of us,

341
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:10,083
it'll be perfect!

342
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:11,916
You're talkin' like a stalker!

343
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,041
Is that bad? I mean,
what's a stalker,

344
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:16,291
but someone who
really really loves you?

345
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:23,916
I get it! Enough! You know that
club, "Hetero"? Stop on by.

346
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,375
We'll talk, catch up some.

347
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:27,833
Mmm, sounds good!

348
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:31,125
By the way, there's one
more important thing

349
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:32,416
I need to tell you.

350
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,000
Huh? Lay it on me?

351
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:35,958
I don't know if
I should, actually.

352
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:39,000
What the hell, you can't
wuss out on me like that now.

353
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:41,625
All right.

354
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:44,583
That stupid long hair of yours
makes you look like a douche!

355
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:45,625
Yeah, says who?!

356
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,125
Says everybody!

357
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:49,333
I'm just telling you this
for your own good, man.

358
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:50,875
As your friend!
People all call you

359
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:53,541
that "long-hair-pretty-bo
oy-douc chey-guy"!

360
00:18:58,125 --> 00:18:59,375
Sup dawg?

361
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:04,916
Good shit.

362
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:08,666
Hyah!

363
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,166
You oughta learn to
keep your mouth shut

364
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,000
and not piss me off, baldy.

365
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:13,916
Who you callin' baldy?!

366
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,458
It's you that oughta get
ready for an ass-whupping.

367
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:18,291
Let's go get him, boys!

368
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:21,875
How in the-

369
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:22,875
Yanagihara.

370
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:23,833
Flame.

371
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:25,250
Birdes.

372
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:26,958
Yeah!

373
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,750
Eeesh, you have
got to be kidding me!

374
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:32,041
Huh?

375
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:33,500
Guess I'll see ya around!

376
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:34,708
Wha.

377
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:36,708
Wait up, guys!

378
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:38,416
Thank you, Kazuma.

379
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:42,500
My friendship with you
ultimately led me to her.

380
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:44,041
Hey. Who was that girl?

381
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:47,666
When I turned around,
there she was!

382
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,416
Well then, who might this be?

383
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,416
Allow me to introduce
myself. I am Yoji Haneda.

384
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:58,416
Would you mind not further
complicating the image

385
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,666
I have of Takashi?!

386
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:03,250
My mistake, I'll never
do it again. Uh.

387
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:05,291
'Kay, get ready!

388
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:14,208
"This just about brings
an end to our regularly

389
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:16,666
scheduled program. Please join
us again in the future."

390
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,625
Or something else that's meant
to wring some waterworks

391
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:21,083
out of you.
Just cry a little bit, ok?

392
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:23,208
Enough of that, though,
how are my listeners doing?

393
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:24,916
Believe it or not,
the Condor lives!

394
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,875
Surely everyone remembers
my tragically heroic death

395
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:29,083
in episode eight! But
appearances can be deceiving,

396
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:31,791
as true legends like the Condor
are not limited by mere notions

397
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:34,500
of life and death! Still, I
appreciate all of your fan mail

398
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:36,375
and "Condor-lences,"
and appreciate those who

399
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:39,416
just chuckled at my adlib.
Improv isn't easy!

400
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,541
And now I leave you with this
final nugget of wisdom--

401
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:43,833
an egg of wisdom, rather.
Fry it, scramble it, boil it,

402
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:45,583
but whatever you do,
take it to heart!

403
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:47,291
Really, the yolk's
healthier than you think!

404
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:49,750
Are you listening? Here goes:

405
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:51,541
Don't be afraid to turn
the channel in life.

406
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,875
Sure, the radio or TV may come
with presets, and you may find

407
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:55,833
yourself compelled to keep
the dial centered on what's

408
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:58,333
already there for you,
but don't sell yourself short!

409
00:20:58,416 --> 00:20:59,666
The direction of your
life is dependent

410
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,083
on the channel you choose.

411
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:03,666
If you don't like that channel,
then change it. Easy!

412
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,041
Easier said
than done, you say?!

413
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:07,000
Come on, I came back
from the dead!

414
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:09,083
If I can self-resurrect,
then you've got no excuses

415
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:10,416
for not flipping a knob!

416
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,916
The world's a huge,
exciting place;

417
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,875
no two channels are alike.

418
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:15,916
So sit yourself down in
that metaphorical sofa

419
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,333
and get to channel surfing!
Don't let those bullies

420
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:21,208
and doubters hog the remote!
You control your destiny!

421
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:23,166
Get rid of that inner
Naraku! And you thought

422
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,916
I wouldn't bring
this back full circle!

423
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,833
Pah, Condor's a professional!

424
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:28,666
That's right, if you learn
anything from this story,

425
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,541
please learn that you
control yourself.

426
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:32,833
Also learn that the
Condor can't be destroyed.

427
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,833
Invincible, I tell
you! Invincible!

428
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:36,833
I kid, that's secondary.
Sort of. Don't get in a rut,

429
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:39,041
be true to yourself,
and you'll do just fine.

430
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:45,625
People were not meant
to live a lonely life.

431
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:48,375
Remember that, and be
reassured that your brethren

432
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:51,000
are always there at your side.

433
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:54,875
We are not angels, and we
cannot soar through the sky.

434
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:59,125
Even so, that does not mean we
cannot at least flap our wings.

435
00:21:59,208 --> 00:22:02,083
I'm positive that if
you all join together,

436
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:06,375
your life on this Earth can be
enjoyable. I'm certain of it.

437
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:11,583
After all, it would seem that
not all of us are without wings.

438
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:19,500
Hey, you made it! Thanks for
sticking with me for so long.

439
00:22:19,583 --> 00:22:23,000
Our story's more or less over.
Well, that's not entirely true;

440
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:24,541
it's technically
still going on,

441
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:27,666
but we just don't have enough
time to go over everything.

442
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:29,958
Long story short, we all
started living life with

443
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:32,666
an eye towards the future.
Oh! You might find this

444
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:35,708
kind of interesting, in my
studies I found out that people

445
00:22:35,791 --> 00:22:38,708
like you are what experts
call "Inner Self Helpers",

446
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:41,791
or I-S-H for short.

447
00:22:41,875 --> 00:22:44,791
They basically take people who
have fallen apart, like us,

448
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:46,208
and help piece
them back together,

449
00:22:46,291 --> 00:22:49,333
granting some
much-needed relief.

450
00:22:49,416 --> 00:22:51,291
We couldn't have
done it without you.

451
00:22:51,375 --> 00:22:56,583
So, on behalf of all of us,
I thank you. Keep it up!

452
00:23:01,458 --> 00:23:04,083
What's the deal, do we start
going to the same school today?

453
00:23:04,166 --> 00:23:07,000
No, silly! I just need to go
so I can fill your teachers

454
00:23:07,083 --> 00:23:11,041
and guidance counselor
in on your situation.

455
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:12,625
Surprise!

456
00:23:15,416 --> 00:23:17,083
Come on. Bring out Takashi!

457
00:23:17,166 --> 00:23:18,291
But, I can't!

458
00:23:18,375 --> 00:23:20,833
Guess I'll have
to slug you first!

459
00:23:20,916 --> 00:23:22,458
Don't you think it's
a little too early

460
00:23:22,541 --> 00:23:24,291
to be acting so violently!

461
00:23:24,375 --> 00:23:27,291
Aw, aren't you just adorable.
I wish I had a little sister

462
00:23:27,375 --> 00:23:30,791
as cute as you. But that doesn't
mean I'm eager to marry

463
00:23:30,875 --> 00:23:32,875
into the family or anything!

464
00:23:32,958 --> 00:23:37,125
Oh. I think. If I had an older
sister that was just like you.

465
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:38,833
I'd never be sad again!

466
00:23:38,916 --> 00:23:40,916
Oh my gosh, she is so precious.

467
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,083
You think so, huh?

468
00:23:42,166 --> 00:23:44,500
I'll follow you to
the ends of the Earth!

469
00:23:46,166 --> 00:23:48,375
I spotted you conversating
from a distance and it looked

470
00:23:48,458 --> 00:23:51,333
much too interesting to pass up!
So I hightailed it over here

471
00:23:51,416 --> 00:23:53,166
fast as I could, good
thing these tires were

472
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:55,375
built for speed!
Am I too late?

473
00:23:55,458 --> 00:23:57,708
No matter, I'll just
start a new subject!

474
00:23:57,791 --> 00:24:00,541
So Kakeru and I had some
stew yesterday for lunch.

475
00:24:00,625 --> 00:24:02,541
Come to think of it, can
you still smell the garlic

476
00:24:02,625 --> 00:24:03,875
on my breath?

477
00:24:03,958 --> 00:24:05,958
Maybe if I get my lips
close enough to your nose

478
00:24:06,041 --> 00:24:08,875
and breathe out, the spirit
of Drac will take over!

479
00:24:08,958 --> 00:24:12,916
Guess I might as well try it.

480
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,333
No ya' don't!

481
00:24:15,958 --> 00:24:18,625
Apparently there's some demand
for me to put out another book.

482
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:21,166
Do you mind if I ask
you for some advice?

483
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:23,958
If it weren't for Shusuke's
article on 88th Birthday,

484
00:24:24,041 --> 00:24:26,625
people might not have ever
given it another chance.

485
00:24:26,708 --> 00:24:29,375
So, thank you.

486
00:24:29,458 --> 00:24:30,333
Huh?

487
00:24:30,416 --> 00:24:32,541
How direct can you get?!

488
00:24:32,625 --> 00:24:33,750
Care to have another whiff?

489
00:24:33,833 --> 00:24:34,833
Back of the line, sister!

490
00:24:34,916 --> 00:24:36,250
C,mon, were going to be late.
