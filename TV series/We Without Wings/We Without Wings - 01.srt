10
00:01:06,958 --> 00:01:08,666
Geez, Birdy, I'm gonna
be late again 'cause

11
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,541
you didn't wake me up on time!

12
00:01:10,625 --> 00:01:12,500
Sorry, I'm not the perfect
little sister who does

13
00:01:12,583 --> 00:01:14,583
all the chores and
takes care of you too.

14
00:01:14,666 --> 00:01:16,875
I guess I'm more
like a cousin, huh?

15
00:01:16,958 --> 00:01:19,541
Surprise! Good morning!

16
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:24,958
Did you sleep well,
future hubby?

17
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:27,875
Um, Asuka. What are you doing?

18
00:01:27,958 --> 00:01:30,000
Sharing a little
affection with my man.

19
00:01:30,083 --> 00:01:31,375
You're making a scene!

20
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:32,166
Who cares?!

21
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:33,375
Let's give 'em an eyeful!

22
00:01:33,458 --> 00:01:35,083
Hey, let go of him!

23
00:01:35,166 --> 00:01:36,916
Listen, future
sister-in-law, he's mine,

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,416
so I get to manhandle him.

25
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,208
No need to get
all jealous n'stuff.

26
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:43,208
I mean, not unless-
Oh my! That's so wrong.

27
00:01:43,291 --> 00:01:44,458
It's not wrong!

28
00:01:44,541 --> 00:01:45,625
He's mine!

29
00:01:45,708 --> 00:01:47,583
And we're always
going to be together!

30
00:01:47,666 --> 00:01:48,958
Forever!

31
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:49,833
Wait a second.

32
00:01:49,916 --> 00:01:51,583
What's that mean.

33
00:01:51,666 --> 00:01:53,125
Oh, no!
Make way, everyone!

34
00:01:53,208 --> 00:01:55,625
My brakes aren't
working so great!

35
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,666
Oh, hello, I didn't
see you standing there;

36
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:02,000
what a surprise, we just seem
to keep running into each other

37
00:02:02,083 --> 00:02:03,083
everywhere, huh?

38
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:04,958
It must be like
fate or something.

39
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:07,041
Call me old-fashioned,
but this feels like something

40
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:09,458
straight out of a fairytale,
wouldn't you agree?

41
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:11,083
Like when a prince
and princess are destined

42
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:13,125
to share a sweet kiss?

43
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:15,125
Hey!

44
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:21,708
Take my advice. When it
comes to those girls,

45
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:24,916
it's like that song by Freaky
Five. Laugh all of them off

46
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,875
with extreme genocide, 'kay?

47
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:31,208
The only girl that
you need in your life is me.

48
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:37,166
Today, once again,
nothing in the world is wrong.

49
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:38,708
Yeah, right.

50
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:43,166
"Everyone in the world likes me,
and all arrows point to me, too.

51
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,458
Wouldn't it be nice if
a world like that existed?"

52
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:48,750
Well, that's how our story
begins tonight on DJ Condor's.

53
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:51,958
"Love Letters From the Abyss!"

54
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:57,041
As always, this program
is brought to you by

55
00:02:57,125 --> 00:03:00,250
the host with the most,
the Ayatollah of rock'n rolla,

56
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:04,625
the man, the myth,
the legend-DJ Condor!

57
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:06,583
For those of you tuning in,
boy do we have a doozy

58
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:08,083
for you tonight!

59
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:10,541
It's a story of deception,
alternate realms, sexy babes,

60
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:11,708
and a whole lot more!

61
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,291
It's a real whale of a tale!

62
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:15,708
You'd better strap yourselves
in, kiddos, because trust me,

63
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:18,166
this is gonna be
one bumpy ride!

64
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:33,500
Hey, nice to meet you!

65
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:34,958
How are you doing today?

66
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:36,750
If it's okay,
I'm gonna be counting on you

67
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:40,041
for a little while,
that is, if you'd be so kind!

68
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,541
This is Shusuke Chitose.

69
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:56,625
He styles himself
as a real ladies' man,

70
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:58,291
but he's always broke,
even though he works

71
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:00,458
various part-time jobs.

72
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:04,125
And this is Alexander,
a restaurant in Yanagihara.

73
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:05,708
Pay attention.

74
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:08,541
Because this place is the focal
point, and it all begins here!

75
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:11,333
Oh, hey, hot stuff,
didja miss me?!

76
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:12,333
Just zip it.

77
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,458
Okay?

78
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:28,333
I wanna have a singles' party.

79
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:29,958
Oh, yeah?

80
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:31,041
That's a great idea!

81
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:33,041
Wow, you da man, Karuo!

82
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:34,750
You never cease
to amaze me, dude!

83
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:36,458
Did I ever tell you that
I really look up to you

84
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:38,625
and that I think
you're a genius and stuff?!

85
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:40,875
I really hope my butt-kissing-
I mean, admiration-

86
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:42,500
means that I'm invited
to this party!

87
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:45,166
Yeah, don't worry, you are!

88
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,958
This scruffy, yet handsome guy
dreaming up the singles' party

89
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:50,416
is Alexander's owner,
Karuo Karube.

90
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,583
Age 35.

91
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,541
A lifelong bachelor
and a bit of a perv.

92
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:56,541
In addition to chicks, he has
a thing for group urination.

93
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:58,083
What we need are chicks.

94
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:00,625
Kakeru, I'm leaving it up to
you to round up some hot ones.

95
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:02,875
And also, make sure they're the
kind of girls that get scared

96
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:04,625
when it thunders and
need a big, strong man

97
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:06,375
to console them, 'kay?

98
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:08,958
Forget it.

99
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:10,708
What?!

100
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,791
This is Kakeru Otori.

101
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:21,625
Stylish, cool, and handsome.

102
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:23,750
A bit of a playboy, and
because of his connections,

103
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:25,708
our source to find hot chicks.

104
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:27,916
But since it sounds like he's
refusing to help us procure

105
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,291
said hot chicks for the party-

106
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:31,000
Crap!

107
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:32,541
This party is doomed!

108
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:34,250
We won't get girls that get
scared by thunder and need big,

109
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:35,916
strong men to console them!

110
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,791
Then why not just change
the requirements to girls

111
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:39,875
who walk barefoot on the
beach and stare pensively

112
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:41,791
under storm-tossed skies?!

113
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,583
Excellent idea!

114
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:45,250
I can envision girls
like the kind you see

115
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:47,583
in perfume commercials that
don't make a lick of sense,

116
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:49,291
or maybe like
actresses in any number

117
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:51,708
of pretentious
art-house movies!

118
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:52,791
Alright then.

119
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:53,666
We need you.

120
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,500
How 'bout it?

121
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:55,291
We're counting on you, dude!

122
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:56,166
Give it up.

123
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,500
Stop closing the door!

124
00:05:57,583 --> 00:06:00,416
Come on, Kakeru, why do
you have to be like that?

125
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,333
Without your help, do you know
what our chick selection

126
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:03,791
is limited to?

127
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:06,166
Cougars that stick tips in
my pants and that toothless,

128
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:07,791
homeless broad in the alley.

129
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:10,125
Tell them all that
I said hi, would you?

130
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:11,958
Kakeru, we're begging you here!

131
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:14,875
You've got a network of hot
chicks that me and Karuo don't!

132
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:16,333
Can't you throw a few our way?!

133
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:18,500
Won't you please find it
in your heart to help those

134
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:20,958
who are less
fortunate than you?!

135
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:24,916
I'm sure you'll
manage somehow, Shu.

136
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,291
Alright, fine!

137
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:28,250
Thanks to you, me and Karuo
won't be getting any,

138
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:29,666
Mr. Selfish!

139
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:33,500
That's a good thing, especially
since Karuo is engaged.

140
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:35,375
Wait, you're getting hitched?!

141
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:36,958
Yeah, next month in fact.

142
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:38,125
He's also gonna be a daddy.

143
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:40,458
And you, knocked her up?!

144
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:42,958
That's yes to both, and
that's exactly why I wanna have

145
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:45,125
a singles' party before
I have to settle down!

146
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:46,541
That's so cool!

147
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:48,416
One last fling in the face
of a looming domestic life

148
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,541
with the same woman!

149
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:51,416
You're going out
like a real champ, dude!

150
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,875
I hope you bang
a bunch of broads

151
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:55,541
to commemorate the occasion!

152
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:57,541
That's not a good idea,
unless you want to get

153
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,208
more girls pregnant
than just your fiancée.

154
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:02,333
Hey, this party's a
get-together, not an orgy

155
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:04,291
where we do the
horizontal mambo all night!

156
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:06,708
The only thing we're gonna
be trading is conversations,

157
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:09,000
not condoms, you understand?!

158
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:11,708
Heh, I've never heard
of "trading condoms" before.

159
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:14,375
Wow, So how's that work exactly?

160
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:16,833
You pass 'em around before
or after you use 'em?

161
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:19,291
You misunderstand, smartass!

162
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:20,666
Besides, I don't use rubbers!

163
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,041
A real man never does!

164
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:24,750
Which explains why
your fiancée is pregnant.

165
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:31,125
Hey, flunkie,
can I get a refill?

166
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:32,333
Right away, sir!

167
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:34,041
Sorry, I didn't see
you were empty.

168
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:35,666
Here you go.

169
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:40,375
As for that nickname, I may not
be a "flunkie" for much longer.

170
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:41,458
That's right!

171
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:42,583
Kinako here's
gonna attempt to pass

172
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:44,500
the college
entrance exams again!

173
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:47,583
And if she aces them, she'll
go to school with sexy coeds

174
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:49,125
who run around the dorms
in their underwear

175
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:50,458
and shower together!

176
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:52,708
Well, I don't know about
that, but I am hoping that

177
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:55,875
the third time's the charm for
me taking the entrance exams.

178
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:58,041
They're really hard,
so I'm really going to have

179
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:00,541
to buckle down and study
for the entire next month.

180
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:03,208
I'm taking the next four weeks
off to do that, so wish me luck.

181
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:05,375
I'm so gonna miss
seeing you in your uniform!

182
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:06,666
Aw, thank you, Shusuke.

183
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,041
That's super sweet.

184
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:10,916
You know, I think
I'm gonna miss this place.

185
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,125
Likewise, and that's
why we wanna throw you

186
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:14,458
a going away party.

187
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:16,666
We were just talking
about that, in fact.

188
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,291
Right, Shusuke?

189
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:21,791
Yeah, we sure were!

190
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:24,541
What better way to say goodbye
than a kickass party?!

191
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:27,625
Oh, man, Karuo is a genius!

192
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:28,833
That's nice, but no.

193
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:30,166
Don't go through
the trouble just for me.

194
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,791
It's no trouble
at all, we insist!

195
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:33,708
Just bring yourself and
a couple of hot friends,

196
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,541
and it'll be a killer singles'
- I mean - send-off party

197
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:38,500
you will never forget!

198
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:41,833
And there's this one:
Kinako Mochizuki.

199
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:44,500
Cute-as-a-button part-time
waitress and frequent recipient

200
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:46,333
of Karuo's sexual harassment.

201
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:49,083
Every year at this time, she
takes a vacation and uses it

202
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:51,333
to study for the
college entrance exams.

203
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:53,791
Unfortunately, she's flunked
them two years in a row now,

204
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:56,750
but as she said,
she's trying again.

205
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:58,375
You're okay with a waitress?

206
00:08:58,458 --> 00:09:00,750
What happened to girls that need
consoling when it thunders,

207
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:03,375
or ones that stare pensively
under stormy skies?

208
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:05,125
If you're not gonna
help us plan the party,

209
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:06,583
butt out, wise guy!

210
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:09,125
Are you really sure
about doing this, Boss?

211
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:10,791
Yeah, I insist!

212
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:12,958
We'll reserve the bar for your
private going-away party

213
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:14,083
tomorrow night.

214
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:15,958
How does eight o'clock
sound, Kinako?

215
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:17,625
You can make it then, right?

216
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:19,208
Yeah, sure.

217
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:21,083
Again, this is really kind of
you, and drinks with you guys

218
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:22,791
should be lots of fun!

219
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:23,750
It sure will!

220
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:24,916
And, maybe, who knows?!

221
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,833
As much as I like you
in that outfit,

222
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:30,083
perhaps I'll get lucky tomorrow
night and see you out of it!

223
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:36,500
Um, Kinako, I was
just joking; are you mad?

224
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:43,833
No not at all, peaceout! Well,
I've gotta get back to work now.

225
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:44,875
One chick down .

226
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:46,416
I know.

227
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,125
But she didn't say anything
about bringing any hot friends,

228
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:49,166
did she?

229
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:52,333
Kakeru!

230
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:53,750
That's my cue to leave.

231
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:55,666
Wanna stay here with
the loudmouth or go with me?

232
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:56,541
No, don't!

233
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:57,833
Stay here, Kakeru!

234
00:09:57,916 --> 00:09:59,750
But you can leave, Shusuke.

235
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:01,541
You've been nursing
that cup of coffee forever.

236
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:02,000
Hey!

237
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:03,333
Karuo!

238
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:04,916
Did you hear what your
employee just said to me?!

239
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,416
She's insinuating that I'm cheap
because all I bought was coffee!

240
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,458
But you didn't.

241
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,250
That coffee was on the house.

242
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:15,166
This is Eriko Hino,
a student at a girl's college,

243
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,791
and the so-called
"platoon leader"

244
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:18,375
of Alexander's waitstaff.

245
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:21,083
Nice to look at,
but she's not nice to me.

246
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:21,791
So?

247
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:23,166
What do we do, Shusuke?

248
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,458
Well, Kinako
can't be the only girl,

249
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:26,875
we've gotta get
some more chicks.

250
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:28,916
But we should really try
to invite some nice ones.

251
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,833
No mean-as-hell
ball-busters like Eriko, 'kay?

252
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:33,166
Idiot.

253
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,541
Didn't you notice the
"mean-as-hell ball-buster"

254
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:35,500
was still here?

255
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:37,083
Well?

256
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:39,916
No, hold on, I meant like your
"sweet-as-pie", "head server!"

257
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,791
Uh-huh!

258
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:42,458
Leave him alone, Eriko, please?

259
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:45,166
Come on, he's making way
too much racket in here.

260
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:47,541
Of course I'll leave him alone;
you know I'm always happy

261
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:49,875
to do anything you
ask of me, Kakeru!

262
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:52,583
So, what was all this business
I heard about a party?

263
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:56,791
Um, well, I hope you don't
mind me asking you this, Eriko.

264
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:58,416
But what do you do
when you hear the crack

265
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,750
of thunder in the sky?

266
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:00,250
Huh?

267
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:01,041
Thunder?

268
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:01,916
Are you mental?

269
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,291
No.

270
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:06,000
Look, you're a girl,
so when the sky goes "BOOM!",

271
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:09,333
do you maybe fall to your knees
and go "Eeeek?!" Like that?

272
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:10,375
You are mental!

273
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:12,166
Girls like that
don't really exist!

274
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,250
They do!

275
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:14,625
They're out there
somewhere, I know!

276
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:16,291
And I'm gonna find those
girls and they're gonna come

277
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,916
to the killer party we're
about to have, you'll see!

278
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,875
I hope you have a time machine,
'cause the only place

279
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:22,333
you'll find women
like that is in the past!

280
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:23,500
Eriko's out.

281
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:24,291
Thank you.

282
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:25,833
Huh? What gives?

283
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:29,083
All I did was ask about this
party and you never answered me.

284
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:31,208
They're having a singles'
party tomorrow night.

285
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:31,833
Yeah?

286
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:32,625
I'm there!

287
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:33,291
Wow!

288
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:34,958
I love a good party!

289
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:36,458
That was easy.

290
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:38,000
Of course it was.

291
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:40,250
Haven't you ever heard
what my friends call me?

292
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,875
Ask anyone, and they'll tell you
that I didn't earn the nickname

293
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:44,791
"Eri the Party Monster"
for nothing!

294
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:45,666
You must be proud.

295
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:46,958
Who's showing up to this thing?

296
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:47,583
Doctors?

297
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:48,416
Lawyers?

298
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,458
Celebs?

299
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:51,541
A restaurateur with sex appeal.

300
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:53,333
A broke guy looking to score.

301
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:56,208
Plus Kinako and
at least one escort.

302
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:57,291
Hang on.

303
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:59,125
Um, I'm washing
my hair tomorrow night.

304
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:01,166
But you're the "Party Monster!"

305
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:03,750
No, not if you and the boss
are the only guys coming.

306
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:06,375
If Kakeru came,
I might change my mind.

307
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:09,000
You "might?",So if
I did agree to come,

308
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:10,333
you still wouldn't be sure?

309
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:12,875
Wow, You stuck-up bitch.

310
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:16,208
Ohhh!

311
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:18,791
I just love it when you
talk dirty to me, Kakeru!

312
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:20,458
Tell me what a bad,
nasty girl I've been!

313
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:21,750
That's two chicks now!

314
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:22,916
We just need one more!

315
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,208
Yeah, but who?!

316
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:25,875
Hey, wait, I got it!

317
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:28,208
How 'bout we order
one of those naughty nurses?!

318
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:30,208
That'll make three!

319
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:35,666
Where and when's
this party tomorrow?

320
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,291
Here at the bar, eight o'clock.

321
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:40,041
I'll have it reserved
exclusively for the party.

322
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:42,958
I haven't been to
a party in a long time.

323
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:44,916
Alright, I can't wait.

324
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,666
Um, Eriko, you stopped getting
invited to parties because

325
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:50,125
you got totally plastered
and ended up trashing 'em?

326
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:51,541
Oh, how sweet!

327
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:53,125
I'm touched that you know
so much about me, Kakeru!

328
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:55,583
Yep, she's definitely in!

329
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:58,708
So, you really don't care
who comes to your party?

330
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:01,958
Nope, not as long as she is
a real chick and has a pulse.

331
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:08,041
Well, I guess the two waitresses
meet those exacting standards,

332
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:09,375
don't they?

333
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:10,791
You're coming to the party.

334
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:11,833
Aren't you?

335
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,250
Count me out.

336
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:16,000
I'd just be a third wheel
since you have two girls.

337
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:17,541
Don't worry about it.

338
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:19,875
I've got someone in mind
to be our third girl.

339
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:21,125
There ya' go!

340
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:23,958
Thanks, but don't put
yourselves out for me.

341
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:26,166
It's okay, dude;
the more the merrier, right?

342
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:27,416
Uh.

343
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,916
I think that including
me would end up making

344
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,500
the mood less merry, don't you?

345
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:33,083
No, that's why we need you.

346
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:38,250
That icy demeanor of yours, it
gives our trio a little variety.

347
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:40,000
Alright, fine, I'll go.

348
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:40,791
Booyah!

349
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:43,666
Now we've got Kakeru, too.

350
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:46,416
I've got something to do, guys,
so I'll see you two tomorrow.

351
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,750
Yeah, Sure.

352
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:49,291
So what'd you think about this?

353
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:50,250
It was good.

354
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:51,625
Nice job there, Shu.

355
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:53,333
This should
take care of my tab.

356
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:06,000
I guess they're
looking for help,

357
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:08,000
because Kinako's
leaving for a month.

358
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,250
'Kay.

359
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:12,416
That'll be a carbonara and
a blended coffee, right?

360
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:20,375
What are you doing?!

361
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:23,333
That's not the right way to
get your waitress' attention!

362
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:25,625
Wait, these things
aren't striped.

363
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:27,833
Unstriped panties
are the worst.

364
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:29,208
Um, sorry.

365
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:30,708
But that's what I wear.

366
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:33,750
I hate unstriped panties,
so not anymore, you don't!

367
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:38,750
Let go of me!

368
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:40,541
Even a good tip isn't worth
this kind of humiliation!

369
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:42,500
Stop it, you little pervert!

370
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,375
Wow.

371
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:47,583
There's never
a dull moment at Alexander.

372
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:49,166
I love this place.

373
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,958
Yanagihara runs a great
distance east and west,

374
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:06,458
with the station serving
as the border between them.

375
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:09,583
The west side houses the city's
booming business district,

376
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:11,875
while the east is home to
the entertainment district,

377
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:14,416
which is a really
bustling place at night.

378
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,500
And a spot where we now
find one of our major players.

379
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,000
Here, look.

380
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:24,916
Hayato Narita.

381
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,333
About twenty years old.

382
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:28,791
Does odd jobs but
is technically unemployed.

383
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:31,458
Zodiac sign and
blood type are both secret.

384
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:35,541
A hard-boiled guy; well,
at least by his own description.

385
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:36,750
For real?

386
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:38,666
Yes,I always thought
testicles were something

387
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:41,166
that only an octopus had.

388
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,083
There he is.

389
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:43,333
Hey, Drac.

390
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:47,041
Help a "sustah" out and
buy something, would ya?

391
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:48,333
These ain't my thing.

392
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:49,375
Yeah, right.

393
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:51,958
More like 'cause
yo ass has no money.

394
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:54,833
That is incorrect,
not because of that.

395
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:57,875
It's not his ass that has
no money, but Drac himself

396
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,166
who has no money.

397
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,666
Am I right?

398
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:03,708
Wow, You still haven't picked up
the local lingo yet, huh?

399
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:06,791
You gotta work on your street
slang, don't be so literal.

400
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:08,750
I am not so little.

401
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:11,708
And I know I may be poor, but
at least I earn my own keep,

402
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:13,541
on the other hand,
I bet you probably get

403
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:15,750
some form of allowance,
but you don't really earn

404
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:18,208
a single cent of it,
do you, Alice?

405
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:20,333
Am I right, Little Miss
New-To-This-Country?

406
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:21,625
Uh, sorry.

407
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:24,333
I no speakee
your language, sir.

408
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:25,000
No shit!

409
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:26,875
That's your problem!

410
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:28,125
Give Miss Thang a break.

411
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:29,875
Go easy on her, would ya, Drac?

412
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:31,875
Come on, remember,
she's only a kid.

413
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:34,166
Yeah, that's exactly why I'm
tryin' to get her to learn.

414
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,375
She's gotta be streetsmart
like me, this ain't no place

415
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:40,708
for a kid who probably still
wears bear-print panties.

416
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,333
I am insulted, Drac!

417
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:43,666
Mine have no bears!

418
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,791
They're sexy,
thrilling and lacy!

419
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:47,041
Take a look!

420
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:54,125
Madre de Dios, sweet thang!

421
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:55,458
Pull your dress down, girl!

422
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:56,833
You can't be flashin'
all your bidness out here

423
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,000
on the street like that!

424
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:00,125
The reason is, I am a child.

425
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:02,958
Adults, you see, they do not
find children attractive.

426
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:04,458
Not at all.

427
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:05,958
Wrong, honey!

428
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:07,958
The men in this country are
full-on "fuh-reaks" for kids

429
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:09,916
and for people
who dress like them!

430
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,166
C'mon, man!

431
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:13,083
That's just a bad
stereotype of Japanese men

432
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:14,791
that you're helpin' perpetuate!

433
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:16,708
Do you want to do it, Drac?

434
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:17,625
With me?

435
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:20,083
Do what?

436
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:21,958
You have one, right?

437
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,791
One of those "peninsula"
things men have in their pants?

438
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:29,583
So do you want to take it, and
then, um, well, how do you say?

439
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:31,958
Get "biz-zay" and knock shoes?

440
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:36,916
Well, Come on,
come on, come on!

441
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:39,750
No!

442
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:40,458
Now learn the language,
and watch out for

443
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:41,916
dirty old men out here.

444
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,125
There's a lot of them.

445
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:45,500
"Dirty?" Do they
all need baths?

446
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:47,000
Should I offer to bathe them?

447
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:47,833
No!

448
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:49,041
And that's not what I meant!

449
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:51,000
Go hit those
language books now!

450
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:34,833
Hey!

451
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:35,541
Drac!

452
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:36,583
Over here!

453
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:37,291
Huh?

454
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:38,333
What?

455
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:39,708
For you.

456
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:41,000
What's this about?

457
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:43,375
Do you always have to be
such a pain in the butt?

458
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:46,458
Come on, answer it, Look,
he told me if you came here,

459
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:48,666
he really wanted
to talk to you.

460
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,166
"He?" Who do you mean?

461
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,458
It's Eiji.

462
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:56,333
Hey!

463
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:57,916
What the hell, Drac?!

464
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,416
I try to help get you a job and
that's how you respond to it?!

465
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,916
Ingrate!

466
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,208
Thanks, but the job was crap,
and probably illegal, too,

467
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:05,750
if Eiji's involved.

468
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:09,166
Speakin' of jobs, are there any
available here at Pal Crepe?

469
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:09,833
What?

470
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:11,041
For you?

471
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:11,708
Yep.

472
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:12,958
If there are, Harue.

473
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:15,166
Simply stop by the
Narita Contractor's Office

474
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,708
in your neighborhood.

475
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:19,083
I'm sorry!

476
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:20,875
We don't currently have
any openings at this time.

477
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:21,833
Asshole.

478
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:23,875
And, since you need employment.

479
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:25,875
Might I suggest this
job for Eiji that you

480
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:27,291
just stupidly turned down?!

481
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,916
I told you, I don't like
Eiji's jobs; they're sketchy!

482
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,416
Like squattin' in
condemned-lookin' apartments

483
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,583
for a week.

484
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:34,583
You should see the
rats in those places!

485
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:36,666
Sometimes his jobs entail
havin' to take really

486
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,333
suspicious-lookin'
packages and leave them

487
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:40,791
in lockers at the station.

488
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:42,500
Even worse, sometimes
I have to bury stuff

489
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:44,833
out in the middle of nowhere.

490
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:46,041
Yeah, so what?

491
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:47,791
What kind of person
begs for a job, gets it,

492
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:49,625
then complains
about it afterwards?

493
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:52,458
Eiji paid you for all of those
jobs you did, didn't he?

494
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:54,625
So then what the hell
are you whining about?

495
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:56,958
I help people, and Eiji's
jobs cause more problems

496
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:58,875
for people who're
already in trouble.

497
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:00,708
I didn't know the
Narita Contractor's Office

498
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:03,375
was in a position
to pick and choose.

499
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:05,791
Sadly, it's not,
I want honest work.

500
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:07,666
Don't you have
anything like that for me?

501
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,916
Come on, anything at all. 

502
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:14,666
Huh?

503
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,166
If you want some honest work,
then wash the truck for me,

504
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,583
okay?

505
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:20,083
Sure, but so you know, the
Narita Contractor's Office

506
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:22,000
charges nine-fifty an hour.

507
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,916
Oh, please, come on, Narita.

508
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,166
It's honest work.

509
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:27,750
Don't you know that some
of the most honest work

510
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:29,208
is the unpaid kind?

511
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:31,125
Well, that's the kind
I don't do, see ya'.

512
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:32,458
Help out a friend.

513
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:34,791
Think of it like morality:
you'd loan an umbrella

514
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:37,583
to an old man who was
in need of one, wouldn't you?

515
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:40,208
Sure, if he paid me or offered
me somethin' in return,

516
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:42,375
like maybe somethin' to eat?

517
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:42,958
Fine!

518
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:43,833
I get it!

519
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:45,458
You drive a hard bargain, jerk!

520
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:47,125
You can have one
crepe on the house,

521
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:48,583
but only after you're done!

522
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:50,000
You're payin' me in food?

523
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:51,041
Geez.

524
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:52,416
While we're on that subject.

525
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,750
You never paid me
for your ramen last week.

526
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:58,250
So unless you want to do
so right now, get scrubbing!

527
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:02,041
Right away.

528
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:06,458
So I ended up workin'
Eiji's job after all,

529
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:09,166
I've gotta get somethin'
else better and soon.

530
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:11,208
At least I hope I can.

531
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:13,500
Maybe a good job's
not in the cards.

532
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,833
What are you looking at?

533
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:46,416
The place I'll have
to return to one day, my home.

534
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:52,958
Oh, that's some
imagination you've got there.

535
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:54,875
Asuka!

536
00:21:58,125 --> 00:21:59,791
Sorry, those are my friends.

537
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:01,416
See ya!

538
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:04,500
That place is real.

539
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:06,375
So are my feelings for you.

540
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:07,416
He's real cute, huh?

541
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,583
Asuka Watarai, I love you.

542
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:15,208
I have to finish things
quickly, I don't have

543
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:17,291
much time left here.

544
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:21,958
I am not of this world.

545
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:24,458
I transferred here
from Gretagard,

546
00:22:24,541 --> 00:22:27,000
a world beyond the skies.

547
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:30,791
The real me is a candidate
to be Gretagard's next king.

548
00:22:30,875 --> 00:22:34,500
One of the "Four Feathers
of 10,000 Colors".

549
00:22:34,583 --> 00:22:37,416
The sacred knight, Hawk.

550
00:24:11,041 --> 00:24:14,708
The sky goes ever onward,
unbroken, right?

551
00:24:14,791 --> 00:24:19,125
This is just an example,
but-What we're telling you

552
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:21,916
is that simple kind
of a fairytale.

553
00:24:23,583 --> 00:24:25,875
We got this from a caller
named Mr. Number One,

554
00:24:25,958 --> 00:24:28,083
and he wants to know if there'll
be more forced panty shots

555
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:29,291
in the next episode.

556
00:24:29,375 --> 00:24:31,458
The answer is yes,
Mr. Number One,

557
00:24:31,541 --> 00:24:33,791
both next time, and all
the times after that!

558
00:24:33,875 --> 00:24:36,333
See you next panties -
I mean - episode!
