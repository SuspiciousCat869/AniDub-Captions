1
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,666
Who is the king? It's you!

2
00:00:23,458 --> 00:00:26,500
Okay! Looks like it's me!

3
00:00:26,583 --> 00:00:28,000
Let's see here.

4
00:00:28,083 --> 00:00:30,500
I want everyone to worship me
and tell me I'm beautiful!

5
00:00:30,583 --> 00:00:32,083
'Cause I'm king.

6
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:33,958
Obey me or die!

7
00:00:35,541 --> 00:00:37,625
Of course, we will obey,
your majesty.

8
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:40,833
Asuka, I think you're taking
this "king" idea too far.

9
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:42,291
Just give us your orders.

10
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,791
I'm pretty sure worshipping
her was her order.

11
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:47,875
"Oh, king you're so beautiful,
I'll worship you forever."

12
00:00:47,958 --> 00:00:50,250
I'm bored with this,
who goes next, huh?

13
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:52,583
Hey, no fair, don't try
to cheat me out of my turn!

14
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm still the king!

15
00:00:54,083 --> 00:00:56,291
I guess I can't let
my guard down at all, can I?

16
00:00:56,375 --> 00:00:58,458
Usurper!

17
00:00:58,541 --> 00:01:00,541
Alright, let's think here.

18
00:01:00,625 --> 00:01:05,166
Number One, you have
to rub Number Three's breasts.

19
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:05,875
Wait!

20
00:01:05,958 --> 00:01:07,166
Hold on a second.

21
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,416
That's a little stereotypical,
don't you think?

22
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,791
Yes, I completely agree.

23
00:01:10,875 --> 00:01:12,666
It just seems ridiculous.

24
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,458
I really don't want
to do that, Asuka.

25
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:16,000
It's creepy.

26
00:01:16,083 --> 00:01:17,375
Do it.

27
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:18,750
Wow!

28
00:01:18,833 --> 00:01:20,166
They're so big!

29
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:23,041
Hey, are you on some kinda
special diet or something?

30
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:23,875
Incredible!

31
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:25,625
My hands won't stop moving!

32
00:01:25,708 --> 00:01:28,708
Not so rough, please!

33
00:01:28,791 --> 00:01:30,541
This is just
starting to piss me off.

34
00:01:30,625 --> 00:01:32,541
We're all girls, so why
is there such a difference

35
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:34,375
in our chest size?

36
00:01:35,291 --> 00:01:37,541
I'm not sure
I'm cool with this!

37
00:01:40,833 --> 00:01:42,583
This is like sex education.

38
00:01:42,666 --> 00:01:44,375
Okay, I'm pulling
the next straw.

39
00:01:44,458 --> 00:01:49,125
Jiggle-jiggle, Jiggle-jiggle,
Jiggle-jiggle, Jiggle-jiggle.

40
00:01:49,208 --> 00:01:51,666
Oh, no!

41
00:01:53,458 --> 00:01:55,875
Hey, everybody, it's your
favorite jockey of the disc.

42
00:01:55,958 --> 00:01:56,791
But what's this?

43
00:01:56,875 --> 00:01:57,958
I've been dissed.

44
00:01:58,041 --> 00:02:00,708
Nobody invited me
to the singles party.

45
00:02:01,833 --> 00:02:06,208
This is DJ Condor's
'Love Letters From the Abyss!'

46
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:08,291
That's right, I'm the host
with the most, but tonight

47
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:10,250
I can't boast,
because as a matter of fact,

48
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:12,416
I have never been
invited to a singles party.

49
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,875
I'm DJ Condor,
the singles party virgin.

50
00:02:14,958 --> 00:02:17,583
But who knows, maybe tonight's
the night I'll get that invite

51
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:19,666
and pop that party cherry?!

52
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,375
I can't take this anymore!

53
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:31,958
Hey, what's up?

54
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:33,291
You showed up again, huh?

55
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:35,416
Thanks, that makes me happy.

56
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,166
If everyone else in this crazy
world was as nice as you,

57
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:41,083
maybe life here would be
a little more tolerable.

58
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:42,875
But, what can you do?

59
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:45,083
Life sucks and then you die.

60
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:47,833
This is why some people
fall to their knees and pray.

61
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:51,750
While others are content to
just get on with their lives.

62
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,541
Oh, come on, are you kidding me?

63
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:55,291
That's just a show he puts on.

64
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:57,333
No, he's a real cutie,
that one.

65
00:04:57,416 --> 00:05:00,333
Yeah, but I hear he can have
a real mean streak sometimes;

66
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:02,000
that's what worries me.

67
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:03,333
No way!

68
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:05,458
Trust me on this one;
he's all bark and no bite.

69
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:07,500
Well, I do want him to be sweet.

70
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:10,791
But also to be tough enough
that he makes me feel safe.

71
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,666
What, is she buyin' a dog?

72
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,166
Woof!

73
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,458
Don't forget: whenever he yells
'I'll friggin' kill you!',

74
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:18,791
it's his way of
showing he cares.

75
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:20,000
Huh?

76
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:22,208
Are you talkin' about me?!

77
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:28,541
Drac, where'd you come from?

78
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:29,333
I just got here.

79
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:30,750
Five seconds ago.

80
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:33,458
Why don't you stop with
the gossip and do your job?

81
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:34,166
Well.

82
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,916
This girl's a customer.

83
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,458
Then how 'bout you shut
your yap and make her a crepe.

84
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:40,875
No, this girl's your customer.

85
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:41,833
Huh?

86
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:43,083
Hey, look.

87
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:44,791
This is the fixer guy
I was telling you about.

88
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:47,125
The Narita Contractor's Office.

89
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:52,500
Who told her about me?

90
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:55,083
I bet she doesn't
even have any money.

91
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:56,625
So, what do you want?

92
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:57,583
Oh, well.

93
00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:59,083
It's really no big deal.

94
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:01,208
I mean, it's not like
it's life or death,

95
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:03,333
It's not important at all.

96
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:04,458
Oh, yeah?

97
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:06,041
Well then,
why don't you just go home?

98
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:07,208
Huh?

99
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:09,750
Yeah, I guess you're right.

100
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:10,625
I'd better go.

101
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:11,958
So sorry to bother you.

102
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:13,625
Don't be so scared.

103
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:15,083
He's just an asshole, okay?

104
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,416
It's not like he's mad at you
or anything like that.

105
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,083
That's just the way he is.

106
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:20,333
Really?

107
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:22,125
I thought he hated me.

108
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:25,041
 Just shut up.

109
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:25,750
See?

110
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:26,916
It's just like I said.

111
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,333
He's so cute when
he gets all worked up.

112
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:32,125
Did I just see you blush?

113
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:35,708
Listen up, wench, who do you
think you're dealin' with, huh?

114
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:38,041
The question is: who do you
think you're dealing with?

115
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:40,333
Hey, I've got a rep to keep up,
and if you don't cut it out

116
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:42,708
right now, I'm gonna smack
you six ways from Sunday,

117
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:43,958
you harlot!

118
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:45,916
I love it when he gets
all feisty like this.

119
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,791
It's adorable, isn't it?

120
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:49,916
Look, Drac.

121
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,458
You're a businessman,
aren't you?

122
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:54,000
Well, you've got a customer
standing right in front of you.

123
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:55,458
Thank you for your business.

124
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:57,416
I am your friendly,
neighborhood fixer,

125
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,250
from the
Narita Contractor's Office.

126
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:01,333
Oh, why, thank you.

127
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:02,083
All right.

128
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:03,458
What can I do for you?

129
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:05,750
Oh, I, Uh. Well, you see.

130
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:07,666
Thing is-

131
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:13,583
Uh, never mind, I'm good.

132
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:16,000
So, you don't need my help?

133
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:21,541
I guess I've only judged her
by her face, huh?

134
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:22,583
But now that
I really look at her,

135
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:26,041
she kind of reminds
me of Shusuke.

136
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:29,500
Enough already,
the girl's looking for a bike.

137
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:30,083
Huh?

138
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:31,666
A bike?

139
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:34,166
Yes, sir, it's a 'two-wheeler,'
as we used to call it back home.

140
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,166
She set it down here,
and took her eyes off of it

141
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,625
for just a second, and then
somebody ran off with it.

142
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,000
Drac, help her find it.

143
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:42,500
Oh, don't be ridiculous,
that thing's gone for good.

144
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:44,500
If you steal a bike, you'd be
stupid not to get rid of it

145
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:46,416
as quickly as possible,
there's no way we're

146
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,125
ever gonna find that--

147
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:50,708
Quit your grumbling and do
something about it, you jerk!

148
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:51,916
You're so negative!

149
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,750
I'm tryin' to be realistic--

150
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:56,375
Are you gonna do it or not?

151
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:57,625
Make up your mind!

152
00:07:57,708 --> 00:07:59,416
Quit smackin' me in the head,
you succubus,

153
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,041
you're gonna give me
split-ends or somethin'.

154
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:02,583
Oh please, what do you care?

155
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:04,125
I doubt you even
wash your hair.

156
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:05,541
The hell I don't!

157
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:07,166
I washed it just this morning,
for your information!

158
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,625
With conditioner
and everything!

159
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:13,625
She can laugh
just like a normal kid.

160
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:19,083
I get what you're
sayin' about the bike.

161
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:19,958
You see that?

162
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,750
Told you he'd help you out.

163
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:24,958
No, it's just, I forgot to
ask you somethin' important.

164
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:27,500
How did you even hear about me?

165
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:31,083
Ka- Uh, I mean, from one
of my brother's friends.

166
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:31,958
What's his name?

167
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:33,583
A big guy named 'Mister Soda'.

168
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:36,333
His right and left hand
were like, 'yo, yo.'

169
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:37,958
So are you with the YFB.

170
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:39,125
Or-?

171
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:40,250
No, not me, But you
might have heard of

172
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:42,416
my big brother actually,
he's the top guy

173
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,333
in the organization.

174
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:46,000
Wait, is your last name Otori?

175
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:46,833
Well, yes!

176
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:49,333
My name is Naru Otori.

177
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:51,250
Naru Otori.

178
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:53,583
It's my first time to meet her,

179
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:56,500
But I definitely know
who her brother is.

180
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:58,750
A year ago, I had a run-in
with the city's so called,

181
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:02,000
'watch group.' The
Yanagihara Flame Birdes,

182
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,416
but truth be told,
they're really just

183
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,916
a bunch of useless punks.

184
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,833
That was the first time
I ran into Kakeru Otori.

185
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:14,583
The de facto leader of the YFB.

186
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:17,125
The imperial majesty
of crazy nights.

187
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:20,791
Long time since
I've met a fellow freak.

188
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:22,416
Let's dance!

189
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:28,166
Naïve, yes?

190
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,375
Mistaken, yes?

191
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:31,458
I'm dead wrong, yes?!

192
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:34,083
Reveal yourself
to me, you punk!

193
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:42,333
Well, well, you're worthy.

194
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:44,583
Come, join the Flame Birdes
and soar with us.

195
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:46,000
You can be one of the chosen.

196
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:47,916
Don't stray, no matter what!

197
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,041
Excuse me, but would you mind
if I asked you something?

198
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:51,791
Oh, yeah.

199
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:53,166
Sure, go for it.

200
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,875
Why is it that everybody
around here calls you, Drac?

201
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:57,125
Well.

202
00:09:57,208 --> 00:09:58,458
You see, the only time I
ever show up around here

203
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:01,791
is at night, So I got
called 'Dracula.'

204
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:02,666
Oh.

205
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,250
Well, I guess that makes sense.

206
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:06,791
He loves that name; make sure
to use it as much as you can.

207
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:07,500
Oh?

208
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:08,625
You're sure that's okay?

209
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:09,750
Just shut up!

210
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:11,583
You do know you're
not her boss, right?

211
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:14,166
So quit orderin' her around
and let her do what she wants.

212
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,708
Yeah, and what if I don't stop?

213
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:17,750
You're not gonna do anything
about it but stand there

214
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:18,833
and look pissed.

215
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:20,625
That's all you do!

216
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:23,458
Well fine.

217
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:26,208
What else can you do
at times like this?

218
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:28,875
That the world may know peace.

219
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:30,250
Pardon me?

220
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:32,625
Thank you for helping
me out, Mr. Drac.

221
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:34,166
Thank you so much.

222
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,500
Uh, Yeah.

223
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:42,916
All righty then!

224
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,916
Manuscript received.

225
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,208
Huh?!

226
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:47,583
Wait, you already read it?

227
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:49,416
How is that even possible?

228
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,416
Is it really that bad?

229
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,666
Oh, no.

230
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,708
You've got it all wrong,
I believe in you, kid.

231
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:56,250
Okay--I'm not sure
how to take that, but-

232
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:57,666
I could really use
some more work,

233
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,750
so if there's anything
you need, just let me know.

234
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:04,208
As a matter of fact, I happen to
have a job for you right here.

235
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:07,041
I need a review on this book
that was just released.

236
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,750
And I need it by next month.

237
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:12,083
Huh, "Youth Cannot Resist It",
by Tama Izumi.

238
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:13,291
So what is it about?

239
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:15,458
It's a new work from
our publishing company.

240
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:19,375
An autobiographical piece
by an ex-porno starlet.

241
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:22,541
I need you to gush all over it
like you always do, okay?

242
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:24,375
One fluff piece coming right up!

243
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:26,916
Our readers are really
starting to like your column.

244
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,125
Meet your deadline
and keep up the good work.

245
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:31,541
Try not to be like Kakeru.

246
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:33,916
That idiot never
meets his deadlines.

247
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:38,458
The editor who lives
for her job, Yu Yoneda.

248
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,333
No, you're not listening.

249
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:43,541
She's an extremely
productive person.

250
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:44,708
Yoneda!

251
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:46,708
All of these captions
are off by a line!

252
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:48,208
 I'm sorry!

253
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:49,375
I'll fix it right away, sir!

254
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:50,875
It won't happen again, I swear.

255
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:52,750
Must be tough being her.

256
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:54,833
I apologize for
my incompetence!

257
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:01,541
Oh.

258
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:02,750
Hey there.

259
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:04,791
Yoneda's been waiting for you?

260
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:07,583
Then let her keep waiting,
I'll come when I'm ready.

261
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:09,458
Man, last night, huh?

262
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:11,375
Those guys we showed
up with really caused

263
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:13,458
a heck of a lot
of trouble, didn't they?

264
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:14,875
What's this now?

265
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:17,041
Don't tell me you're actually
making some new friends!

266
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:18,750
Don't go there, Shu.

267
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:21,875
Look, those guys are just-
Never mind, this has nothing

268
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:23,875
to do with you, okay?

269
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:26,750
Oh, come on, it sounds like
a really awesome story.

270
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:29,625
Don't leave anything out;
you can trust me, dude.

271
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,750
Must be nice being you, huh?

272
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:32,791
Yeah.

273
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:33,958
It is, actually.

274
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:36,625
Look, Tamaizumi.

275
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:39,875
That's former
porn starlet Tama Izumi?

276
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:42,416
This girl definitely had
three square meals a day.

277
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,000
But it wasn't food
she was munching on.

278
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:45,833
No sir.

279
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:46,708
Hold on.

280
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:48,625
Do you know her or something?

281
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:51,041
Not really; Yoneda asked me
to review her book.

282
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:52,708
Oh, I see.

283
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:55,458
Then maybe you should go over
there and introduce yourself.

284
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:56,791
Yeah, you're right.

285
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:58,666
I wonder what kinda' stuff
she likes to talk about?

286
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,583
Oh, you know.

287
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:01,083
The usual girlie stuff.

288
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:03,208
Just look her
in the eyes and be yourself.

289
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:05,375
While you're at it, I'd throw
a few jokes in there, too.

290
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:07,625
Whaddaya mean,
like party jokes or somethin'?

291
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:10,083
No, the same kind
of stuff that Karuo tells.

292
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:12,041
You know, the dirty,
sexual stuff.

293
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,916
No, I can't,
I don't know her!

294
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,833
But, you know her,
don't you, Kakeru?

295
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:17,125
Introduce me already!

296
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:18,458
Why are you
being such an asshole?

297
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:20,250
Come on, man!

298
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:27,125
Be like Karuo.

299
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:29,041
Be like Karuo!

300
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:30,625
Alright!

301
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:32,250
I'll be like Karuo!

302
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:36,208
I've only heard it
second hand, so tell me.

303
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:37,375
Female perverts.

304
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:39,666
Are they real or just fantasy?

305
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,000
Excuse me?

306
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:46,833
Smooth operator!

307
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:49,083
Look, I'm almost certain
you know this already,

308
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:51,625
and forgive me if this comes
across as condescending,

309
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:53,250
but even if you
didn't mean it that way,

310
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:56,916
sexual harassment
is sexual harassment.

311
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,833
Epic fail!

312
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:01,541
I am so sorry about that!

313
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:03,333
I'm not a pervert,
my name's Shusuke and I'm

314
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:04,750
a freelance writer!

315
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:07,541
I know you; you're the
famous Tama Izumi, right?

316
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,125
Oh, well yes, that's me!

317
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:13,000
Sir, I apologize
for my behavior,

318
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:14,916
I've never been
called famous before!

319
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,750
Oh, goodness me,
I really am so sorry.

320
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:20,083
This is way different
from what Kakeru told me.

321
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,375
Have you ever heard
of 'Men's Freeze?'

322
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:27,708
It's the men's periodical
published by Shogensha.

323
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:29,208
Um... Yes.

324
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:30,916
I work freelance for
them from time to time,

325
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,541
and they've asked me to write
a review of your latest book.

326
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:34,958
No way!

327
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,166
Oh, gosh, there's
really no need to stand.

328
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,750
Anyway, I just
happened to spot you

329
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:40,833
sitting over here by yourself,
and thought I should pop over

330
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:42,458
and say hi to a fellow writer.

331
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:44,291
Uh, hey Miss,
is everything okay?

332
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:46,000
I'm so happy,
thank you very much!

333
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:48,041
Uh, Bowing's
not really necessary.

334
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:50,583
Please, just relax
and have a seat, okay?

335
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:54,000
I wonder, would a girl like this
really dig Karuo's dirty talk?

336
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:57,458
He's giving me the 'go' sign?

337
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:00,666
Um, well then.

338
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,541
There's something
I'd really like to ask you.

339
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:04,791
Yes, ask me anything, please!

340
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:07,750
So, what color panties
do you have on today?

341
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:13,500
I see.

342
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:15,583
Am I safe to assume
this is the direction

343
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:16,791
your article will take?

344
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:17,875
Uh, well.

345
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,958
It is a men's
magazine after all, so-

346
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:22,500
Is that a fact?

347
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:26,291
My panties are white.

348
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:33,833
Actually, that's not right.

349
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:35,625
My panties are beige.

350
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:40,208
Oh, really,
they're, beige, huh?

351
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:41,416
How scandalous!

352
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,291
Wait, I look like
a total idiot, here.

353
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:47,375
This conversation is going
nowhere, Is this girl really a-

354
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:49,750
He's just been messing with me!

355
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:50,333
Sir?

356
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:51,750
Yeah. What's up?

357
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:53,541
To be completely honest,
it doesn't make much difference

358
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:55,583
to me how you
present the article.

359
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:57,083
Huh?

360
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:58,541
See, the thing is, all I really
want is for as many people

361
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:01,458
as possible to read my book.
So, if your story can help

362
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:06,458
with that, then please, just
write whatever you want to!

363
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:08,750
I will do everything I can.

364
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:20,458
You know what, Kakeru,
you're a real jerk!

365
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:24,291
Hmm?

366
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:26,583
Well, you two guys
are here pretty early,

367
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:27,875
I guess that means
you're excited

368
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:29,583
about tonight's festivities?

369
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:31,208
The singles' party is tonight?

370
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:32,666
Look at you, Mr. Cool,

371
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,708
acting like this whole
thing is just old hat.

372
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:37,166
Sorry, but your right hand,
porno and lotion don't count,

373
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:37,791
virgin!

374
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:38,708
Hey!

375
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:39,916
I'm not a virgin!

376
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,708
So, what's the story
on that girl you said

377
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:42,916
you'd invite to the party?

378
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,250
Don't you worry, guys.

379
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:45,833
Truth is, I've been out
there looking for some

380
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:48,458
really good tail
to take Mochizuki's place.

381
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:50,916
And I've gotten replies
from some of my former staff.

382
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,125
Your former staff?

383
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:53,708
I don't know any of them, do I?

384
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:58,125
One of them is a student and an
author named Hiyoko Tamaizumi.

385
00:16:58,208 --> 00:16:59,500
 Wait, Tama Izumi?

386
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:01,333
No, no, 'Tamaizumi.'

387
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:03,000
Oh!

388
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:05,541
So the girl in glasses
I met earlier?

389
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:06,791
Yeah, that's the one.

390
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:08,541
Hiyoko Tamaizumi.

391
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:09,875
So this book's not--?!

392
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:12,041
Not by Hiyoko Tamaizumi.

393
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:14,208
But--

394
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:16,916
I need to use your phone!

395
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,708
He sure can be dense
sometimes, can't he?

396
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:21,750
How could I not have
picked up on this sooner?

397
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:24,041
It seems so obvious now
that I think about it!

398
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:26,458
Boy, do I feel like the
dumbest guy in the stairwell.

399
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:27,666
Oh man!

400
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,291
I said I was going
to write that article!

401
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:31,333
Stupid, stupid, stupid!

402
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:32,958
Now I have to ask Yu
to let me write a piece

403
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:35,416
about Hiyoko Tamaizumi, too!

404
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:51,833
Uh, they really
are beige, aren't they?

405
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,916
Hey, yo!

406
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,250
Is everyone havin'
a good time ?!

407
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:01,833
'Cause it's Saturday night,
boys and girls!

408
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:02,875
Yeah!

409
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:04,958
Alexander, rock on!

410
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:07,000
Right on, Shusuke,
you're so awesome!

411
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:09,041
I'm so wasted, and I'm
gonna drink 'till I puke!

412
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:10,375
So, Tamaizumi.

413
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:11,958
You still putting out
books that won't sell,

414
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:15,375
causing publishers to leap
out of their office windows?

415
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:17,666
Yes, thank you for asking, and
I assume that you're floating

416
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,875
through life aimlessly like
the complete waste of space

417
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:23,041
you are, is that an
accurate summation?

418
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:25,083
All right, let's get
things rolling here!

419
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:27,083
Yes, it's time for-'Shine!

420
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:28,708
The third
"Good luck Kinako" event,

421
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:31,250
special party number threeeeee!

422
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:36,166
Please, leave the
emcee duties to me, folks!

423
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:39,541
Spreading joy and
merriment is what I do best!

424
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:42,875
I'd also like an opportunity
to explain myself to Hiyoko.

425
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:48,750
First, let's get all the
introductions out of the way,

426
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:49,833
right?

427
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:51,916
Here's the girl
this night's all about!

428
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:52,791
You mean me?

429
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:53,708
I'm eating.

430
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:54,875
A little more, please!

431
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:56,583
Well, I'm sorry,
but this food's delicious.

432
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:58,458
Hi, I'm Kinako Mochizuki!

433
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:00,791
And what do you think,
Mr. Head Judge?

434
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:02,375
We've got some
pieces of ass out there,

435
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:04,083
but they're lacking
when it comes to romance.

436
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:05,166
Yes, romance!

437
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,208
"Romans"?

438
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:07,208
What about 'em?

439
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:09,541
Is that on the test?

440
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:10,583
Just shut up!

441
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:12,958
Show us how it's
done already, jerk!

442
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:14,208
But of course.

443
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:16,333
Well, good evening ladies,
my name is Karuo.

444
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:18,083
My job is making sweet love.

445
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:20,750
I like naughty romance
and sinful seduction!

446
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:23,208
I'll give you something to
eat you'll never ever forget.

447
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:25,916
Whenever you're in need, I'll
fill you up every single time!

448
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,875
Oh yes, I know the kama sutra.

449
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,916
And I can go all night.

450
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,166
Let's hear it, folks!

451
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,166
Did he really just say
he would 'fill me up?'

452
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,500
I'm pretty sure he was
being metaphysical.

453
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:38,500
Come on, what are you
doing, do you really think

454
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:41,083
you're qualified
to be judging romance?

455
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:42,250
Well.

456
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:44,083
Yes, I do, thank you
so much for asking.

457
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:47,208
I am a hopeless
romantic, oh yeah.

458
00:19:48,916 --> 00:19:50,166
Hey.

459
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:53,833
Wait a second, did you
just laugh at me, Hiyoko?

460
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:56,666
If that's how
they're going to be.

461
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:59,000
Good evening, ladies and
gentlemen, I'm Shusuke and I

462
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:01,625
came here on a white horse
from the land of auroras

463
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:03,666
to help keep true love alive!

464
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:07,041
You wanna guess my profession?

465
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:08,750
I'm known as the Artisan
of glass slippers.

466
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:10,875
My hobby is counting
the stars in your eyes.

467
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:12,958
And I like to add 'try it'
to the end of sentences,

468
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:14,708
even when it makes no sense!

469
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:20,250
And you should know, the animal
I like the most is the Pegasus.

470
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:23,458
Hold on, you just laughed.

471
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:26,375
So does that mean that
you like the Pegasus too?

472
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:27,208
That's right!

473
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:28,708
She laughed!

474
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:31,041
Please, who cares, at her age,
they'll laugh at anything!

475
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:33,208
Oooo, does this mean
he's after Hiyoko?

476
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:35,125
For her sake, I hope not!

477
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:38,166
Oh, come on, give me
a break, you guys!

478
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,375
See that look on her face,
it's as if she's gonna throw up

479
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:42,416
in her mouth, she couldn't
hide that if she tried!

480
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,875
They might actually
be a good couple.

481
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:46,333
So.

482
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:47,958
Spill the beans; how do you
really feel about Hiyoko?

483
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:49,416
Huh?

484
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,583
Well uh, I've been a big fan
of Miss Tamaizumi's books

485
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:53,666
for quite a while now,
and I think her latest one

486
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:56,541
is really interesting too.

487
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:58,708
Not that I've
read it yet, but hey.

488
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:00,958
Oh, well, that's extremely
kind of you to say.

489
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:02,166
Do you really mean
that or are you just

490
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:03,625
saying that to get laid?

491
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:04,500
What?

492
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:05,791
Her book.

493
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:07,291
The latest one's the
super dark one, isn't it?

494
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:09,125
Come on now, if you're
really a fan of her work,

495
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:12,000
you should be able to tell her
what you really think.

496
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:13,458
What's wrong with you?

497
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:15,541
You know he can't say things
like that in front of her.

498
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:16,666
Why not?

499
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:17,875
If he doesn't say it
to her right now,

500
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:20,166
he'd be talking about
her behind her back.

501
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:23,166
I got a plan.

502
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,000
I think we should
talk about hot pants.

503
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:26,208
This guy's onto something!

504
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:28,541
Long live hot pants,
am I right?

505
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:30,291
Speaking of hot pants,
I'm a fan of shirts

506
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:32,375
being tucked into them,
how about you?!

507
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,250
Aww, that was really sweet.

508
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:36,666
Doing my part, sir, leaving them
un-tucked is throwing pearls

509
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,291
before swine, or worse!

510
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:39,958
I think swine is too classy!

511
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:42,000
As far as color goes,
I like navy blue!

512
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:44,875
I've never known anyone who
talks about hot pants like that.

513
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:46,875
Yeah, well,
those two are perverts.

514
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:49,125
For the rest of my adult life
I want to live at a hot spring,

515
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:51,125
drinking hot toddies,
eating hot dogs,

516
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:52,458
and loving those hot pants!

517
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:54,625
Hot pants are the only
pants I'm interested in!

518
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:56,500
Because I've got
the hots for hot pants!

519
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:58,000
As far as I'm concerned,
that's fine;

520
00:21:58,083 --> 00:21:59,500
no one here is stopping you.

521
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:01,041
Shut up, woman!

522
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:04,250
Don't talk to me until you put
on some navy blue hot pants!

523
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:06,375
And don't forget
to tuck in your shirt.

524
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:08,833
Whatever, you guys are
just a bunch of perverts.

525
00:22:08,916 --> 00:22:10,916
Since you like hot pants
so much, go put some on,

526
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,083
you big jerk.

527
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:14,500
You're absolutely right,
they are perverts.

528
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,708
There's no doubt
left in my mind.

529
00:22:16,791 --> 00:22:19,375
Just you remember this, Writings
from antiquity tell us,

530
00:22:19,458 --> 00:22:21,833
devils with buckets and knives
will visit people's houses

531
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:24,250
at night, exclaiming,
'give me hot pants',

532
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:25,958
And those devil dudes
will be really pissed

533
00:22:26,041 --> 00:22:27,166
when there are none!

534
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:30,625
Hey, let's make the
girls put on hot pants.

535
00:22:30,708 --> 00:22:31,625
Where hot pants?

536
00:22:31,708 --> 00:22:32,250
None here.

537
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:33,041
None here.

538
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:34,500
None here.

539
00:22:34,583 --> 00:22:35,958
Uh, yes there are,
over there.

540
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:36,625
For real?

541
00:22:36,708 --> 00:22:37,958
I'll be right back!

542
00:22:41,833 --> 00:22:43,166
Wow, that was fun.

543
00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:48,875
That the world may know peace.

544
00:24:23,125 --> 00:24:24,041
This thing on?

545
00:24:24,125 --> 00:24:25,250
Tell me when
we're rolling, okay?

546
00:24:25,333 --> 00:24:27,583
I can't wait to see
those babes in bikinis,

547
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:29,583
they really get me going.

548
00:24:29,666 --> 00:24:30,125
What?

549
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:31,125
We are rolling?

550
00:24:31,208 --> 00:24:32,458
Oh, come on,
you can't use this;

551
00:24:32,541 --> 00:24:34,125
I'm trying to sell
a clean image here.

552
00:24:34,208 --> 00:24:35,458
You want me fired or what?

553
00:24:35,541 --> 00:24:37,083
Back it up and take it
from the top.
