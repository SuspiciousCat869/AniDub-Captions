1
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,958
Multiple personalities.

2
00:00:15,041 --> 00:00:17,708
So that's it.

3
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:18,875
Yes, exactly!

4
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:20,041
The main character
in this game has

5
00:00:20,125 --> 00:00:21,708
multiple personality disorder.

6
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:24,208
You're not really
Takashi, are you?

7
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:25,791
Uh.

8
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:27,166
No, I'm not.

9
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:27,708
Sorry.

10
00:00:27,791 --> 00:00:29,125
I thought not.

11
00:00:29,208 --> 00:00:30,750
It's kind of difficult to
explain, but if I told you

12
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:32,916
that I was dreaming
and talking in my sleep,

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,375
would you take my word for it?

14
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:35,250
Well.

15
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:36,583
I'm not so sure.

16
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:38,208
The truth is, I've seen
this sort of thing before,

17
00:00:38,291 --> 00:00:40,875
and I've known something was
going on for a long time.

18
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:45,458
I mean, let's not forget that
I am his girlfriend after all.

19
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:47,791
Well, you could say that.

20
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:50,833
Listen, I don't want to stick my
nose in where it doesn't belong.

21
00:00:50,916 --> 00:00:53,000
But I do feel for him,
and I understand what he's

22
00:00:53,083 --> 00:00:56,166
going through in a way
that most people couldn't.

23
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,708
Is that a roundabout way of
saying, 'I'm on your side,

24
00:00:58,791 --> 00:00:59,875
so tell me more?'

25
00:00:59,958 --> 00:01:01,375
Come on, don't be like that.

26
00:01:01,458 --> 00:01:02,833
We can help each other.

27
00:01:02,916 --> 00:01:04,041
Oh, is that a fact?

28
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:05,500
It is.

29
00:01:05,583 --> 00:01:07,750
In a way, I'm in the exact
same situation that he's in.

30
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:09,166
Right.

31
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:10,875
If you help me out by
telling me everything you know,

32
00:01:10,958 --> 00:01:13,458
I'll be more than happy
to return the favor.

33
00:01:15,291 --> 00:01:16,000
Fine.

34
00:01:16,083 --> 00:01:17,375
But I want something, too.

35
00:01:17,458 --> 00:01:19,916
Whatever you do, don't
tell Takashi about this.

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,541
Wait.

37
00:01:20,625 --> 00:01:21,375
What do you mean?

38
00:01:21,458 --> 00:01:22,291
Why not?

39
00:01:22,375 --> 00:01:23,458
Here's the deal.

40
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:24,750
He doesn't even know
we're a part of him

41
00:01:24,833 --> 00:01:26,500
and I'd prefer
to keep it that way.

42
00:01:26,583 --> 00:01:29,583
Something tells me he
wouldn't take it very well.

43
00:01:29,666 --> 00:01:30,666
All right, fine.

44
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:32,041
I won't say a word.

45
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:33,083
Not good enough.

46
00:01:33,166 --> 00:01:34,708
Swear it.

47
00:01:36,666 --> 00:01:38,416
I swear to you on
the life of my brother

48
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,041
who is no longer with us.

49
00:01:40,125 --> 00:01:41,125
Okay!

50
00:01:41,208 --> 00:01:42,916
How about a proper
introduction then?

51
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,958
My name is Shusuke Chitose.

52
00:01:45,041 --> 00:01:46,958
A lot of people call me
'Slippery Shusuke'

53
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:48,541
for some weird reason.

54
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:50,541
But, truth be told, I don't know
whether to be highly offended

55
00:01:50,625 --> 00:01:52,166
or flattered by that.

56
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:54,625
Anyway, I am very pleased
to make your acquaintance.

57
00:01:54,708 --> 00:01:55,791
Well, Shusuke.

58
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:58,125
It's nice to meet you too.

59
00:01:59,125 --> 00:02:00,833
Marvelous!

60
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:41,416
Man, I can't believe you
let the cat out of the bag.

61
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,083
Yeah, well.

62
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:43,708
It just happened.

63
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:44,875
You jerk!

64
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:46,750
Don't stand there
and play dumb with me.

65
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:48,708
What the hell do you think we've
been working our butts off

66
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:50,041
for this whole time, huh?!

67
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:51,375
Dude, she's Takashi's
girlfriend,

68
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:53,250
will you please relax?!

69
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,041
There's no way
he has a girlfriend!

70
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:56,375
That's not cool.

71
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:58,625
It'd hurt his feelings
if he heard you say that.

72
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:00,333
But what about you, Hayato?

73
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:01,791
You seem like you've
had something new

74
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:03,208
on your mind lately.

75
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:06,708
You've got your eye set on
some lucky lady, don't ya?

76
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:08,166
No.

77
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,541
Where in the world would you
get a dumb idea like that?

78
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:11,333
I don't need anybody.

79
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:13,333
But I guess I could
ask you the same thing.

80
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:15,666
What about all those girls
you've been working with lately?

81
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,625
Look, man,
Hiyoko is my superior;

82
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:19,125
we work together
and that's all!

83
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:20,291
Wait, her?

84
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:22,041
I don't think that's
gonna end very well.

85
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:23,208
Stupid me!

86
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:24,750
Now I'm gonna have
to do everything I can

87
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:26,375
to find out the girl you like.

88
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:27,666
And once I trick you
into telling me,

89
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,916
you're gonna
feel like an idiot!

90
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,583
Ha!

91
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:30,291
Come on.

92
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:31,000
Who is it?

93
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:32,375
Spill the beans, buddy!

94
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:34,083
You're really starting
to get on my nerves, man!

95
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:35,666
And don't change the subject!

96
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,708
I wanna know why in the hell
you're running around town

97
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:39,583
telling our secret to
people who have no business

98
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:40,625
knowing about it!

99
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:41,916
It's no big deal.

100
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,166
There isn't much time
left anyway.

101
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:48,375
I told her because Asuka
said that she wanted

102
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:50,083
to help out Takashi.

103
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,708
She did?

104
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:57,541
I guess I gotta few things
to take care of, huh?

105
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:59,250
Tell me about it.

106
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:01,500
But as far as you and I are
concerned, we'll keep going on

107
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:04,208
like we always have, and try
not to ruffle any feathers.

108
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:05,458
Sounds good.

109
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:07,375
But what are we
supposed to do about Takashi?

110
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:08,666
Right.

111
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,583
He still hasn't come back
from Gretegard yet.

112
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:12,708
He's been there
for a really long time.

113
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:13,958
So what now?

114
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:16,833
Only one thing to do.

115
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,083
All right.

116
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:19,333
Let's play for it!

117
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:20,333
Rock, paper-!

118
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:22,041
Scissors!

119
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:29,208
Morning Kobato!

120
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:30,291
Oh, hey.

121
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:32,125
How are you this
morning, Mr. Chitose?

122
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,750
I'm great, just a little
hungry, that's all.

123
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:37,416
Well, breakfast
is almost ready.

124
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:37,958
Wow.

125
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:39,208
Impressive.

126
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:40,708
I can't believe you
actually remembered

127
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:42,458
that I hate asparagus.

128
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:44,375
Also, there's plenty of curry,

129
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:46,125
but it's all left over
from last night.

130
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:47,541
Hey, that's okay by me.

131
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:49,583
I think curry's
even better the next day.

132
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:51,916
Uh, Shusuke.

133
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,750
'You know who', has something
bad happened to him?

134
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:56,416
Oh, do you mean Takashi?

135
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,083
No, it's the same
as it always is,

136
00:05:58,166 --> 00:06:00,000
he's just staying
a little longer this time.

137
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:01,875
Don't worry,
everything is gonna be fine,

138
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:04,333
Hayato and I will cover
for him in any way we can.

139
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:07,250
So it's just you
and Mr. Narita then?

140
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:08,166
Is that all?

141
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,583
What do you mean?

142
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:10,958
What about Mr. Itami?

143
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:13,666
Who's that? Oh! Karura!

144
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:16,958
Don't worry; I doubt he'll
be coming out anymore.

145
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:19,083
There's nothing for you
to be concerned about.

146
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:20,583
Besides, the world's
a much better place

147
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:23,375
when that rambunctious piece
of work stays hidden away.

148
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:26,500
It's happened several
times before, you know?

149
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:29,000
There were others besides big
brother and 'you know who',

150
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:32,125
that were here one day
and then just gone the next.

151
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:33,416
Vanished.

152
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,041
In a blink of an eye,
they disappeared like

153
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:36,791
they were never there.

154
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:42,750
Please, don't worry.

155
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:45,291
Everything's fine.

156
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:47,083
Good morning, everyone.

157
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:50,291
Get this!

158
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:52,208
Oh, sorry about that, buddy.

159
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:54,083
No, no don't worry about me.

160
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:55,916
You smacked your hand
pretty hard, are you sure

161
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,375
you're gonna be
all right, friend?

162
00:06:57,458 --> 00:07:00,125
Yeah, I'm fine.

163
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:02,041
Just be low-key,
act like Takashi

164
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:04,041
and everything'll be a-okay.

165
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:16,625
Hey, I didn't know
we were in the same class.

166
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:18,041
Yeah, I guess we are.

167
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:19,541
You're really
eating bread for lunch?

168
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:23,166
Uh. You know, the cafeteria
is always so busy.

169
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,791
I bought this on the way here.

170
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:26,958
What's up, do you wanna
split this with me?

171
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:28,833
No. I'm all set.

172
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:32,125
It's fascinating. Just when
I think I've met all of them,

173
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:34,250
here's another one
who pops up out of the blue.

174
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:35,625
Uh, what do you mean?

175
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:38,000
Oh, I'm just
thinking out loud.

176
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:43,666
Okay. That sure was weird.

177
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:54,958
Takashi! Takashi! Takashi!
Takashi! Takashi! Takashi!

178
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,041
What's up Takashi?!

179
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:58,041
Uh. Hey. Who're you?

180
00:07:58,125 --> 00:07:59,875
Oh, come on now,
you silly goose,

181
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:01,250
you know exactly who I am!

182
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:03,791
--I'm Miyako Yamashina!
--Don't hit me. That hurts!

183
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:05,458
Yesterday was
absolutely wonderful!

184
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:10,375
I was so touched! So
thrilled! So moved to tears!

185
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:12,000
I never imagined
in my wildest dreams

186
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:14,000
that you would
be so bold. Wow!

187
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:16,000
I'm so glad I
finally approached you!

188
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:17,541
Good job, Miyako!

189
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:19,125
Uh. Awesome?

190
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:21,083
I don't know if you know this,
but it was my first time too.

191
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:22,666
My heart was pounding
like crazy but you were

192
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:23,875
so sweet and gentle.

193
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:25,458
Uh, I don't know why
you're making that face?

194
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:27,041
Yesterday I was
an innocent little girl,

195
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:28,666
but today I woke up a woman!

196
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:32,208
And all because
I gave myself to you!

197
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:34,041
Oh, Takashi,
what have you done?!

198
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:35,625
Last night, I could
barely keep my eyes closed

199
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:37,166
thinking about
how romantic you were.

200
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,083
All I wanted to do was hold
you tight and squeeze you

201
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:41,291
till your head
popped right off!

202
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:44,083
Then, I couldn't stand
it anymore so I had to

203
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:48,041
do something about it, I felt
flushed. Oh, so flushed.

204
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:51,708
Like I was gonna explode,
and so I did it.

205
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:55,208
Wait Did it? Whadja do?

206
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:57,333
I read our fortune!

207
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:58,708
See?

208
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:00,291
I checked our compatibility
and we're a solid pair!

209
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:02,083
I tried flowers, stars, animals,
even tortoise shell divination

210
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:05,375
and every single time we came
out a completely perfect match!

211
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:06,916
It's really cool that
you talked to me for so long!

212
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,375
It's been quite a while
since I've had somebody

213
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:09,666
I could get so close
to like that!

214
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:10,875
Thanks for taking the
time to make me feel

215
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:12,375
as though I really matter!

216
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:14,375
It's so nice not to worry about
having to try and fit in!

217
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,833
Man.

218
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:23,166
And here I thought Takashi
lived the regular old boring,

219
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:26,291
life of a high school kid,
but boy was I wrong.

220
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:29,583
Looks like Asuka's not the only
person I have to watch out for.

221
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:31,125
Hey, you.

222
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:32,958
I really don't appreciate you
sneaking up on me like that;

223
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:35,208
and I'm not a stranger,
I already told you my name,

224
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:35,833
remember?

225
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:36,875
Shunosuke.

226
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:37,875
It's just Shusuke.

227
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:39,125
Just Shusuke.

228
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:40,833
Strike the just and then
what does that leave?

229
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:42,125
Shunosuke.

230
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:43,708
I already told you,
there's no 'no' in there.

231
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:44,291
Shusuke.

232
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,333
It's Shusuke!

233
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:47,541
Gesundheit.

234
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:49,291
Take two aspirin and
call me in the morning!

235
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:51,458
Thanks a lot, folks,
we'll be here all week!

236
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,791
So tell me.

237
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:56,250
Why in the heck has Shusuke
been front and center

238
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:57,708
since this morning?

239
00:09:57,791 --> 00:09:59,083
It's kind of a long story.

240
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:01,375
Any possible way I could
speak to the real deal?

241
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:03,250
Unfortunately, no,
he's a little late

242
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:04,833
getting back this time.

243
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:07,833
I mean, you're supposed to limit
your gaming to one hour per day.

244
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:09,333
So, when is he coming back?

245
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:11,250
I'm afraid I don't
have that information.

246
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:13,666
Listen: I want to speak
to him right now, got it?

247
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:14,750
Not possible.

248
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:16,250
But, at the risk
of being presumptuous,

249
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:18,000
you could pretend I'm him.

250
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:19,583
Funny. But you know?

251
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:21,333
I'm wondering if smacking you
upside the head might make him

252
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:22,791
come back a little sooner.

253
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:24,458
Hey, there's no need
to be angry.

254
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:27,208
Ya' know, I never would've
taken you for the violent type.

255
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:31,625
I'm glad that's over!

256
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:34,708
Oh yeah, I feel much more
comfortable in my own skin!

257
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:36,916
Let's show'em what
Shusuke Chitose is made of.

258
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,708
That's right, I'm the man!

259
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:40,291
Yeah, would you
be quiet, please?

260
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:41,416
Okay.

261
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,625
Hey guys, you gotta second?

262
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:46,166
There's something important
I've been meaning to tell you.

263
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,041
So. As you
undoubtedly know already,

264
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:50,166
Christmas Eve
is coming up very soon.

265
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,125
Uh yeah.

266
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:52,500
We've heard.

267
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:55,000
For most, it's a holy night
of joy and celebration.

268
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:56,583
But for those of us in
the restaurant business,

269
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:58,500
it's a fight to the finish!

270
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:01,166
That said, I wanna make sure
we have more customers

271
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,250
at Alexander than any
other joint in town,

272
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:07,041
so I've devised a
plan! And here it is!

273
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:10,291
A healthy dose of 't and a',
brought to you by our very own

274
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:11,833
pop supergroup!

275
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:14,500
And We are the 'Alex 2'!

276
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:17,875
We did it!

277
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:20,125
Our big moment to shine in
the spotlight's finally here!

278
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:21,583
Hey. Don't cry.

279
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:23,916
We're pop stars,
we're supposed to be smiling!

280
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,833
You're so right.
Thank you Eriko!

281
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:27,625
We worship you!
You're the best!

282
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:29,583
You're so hot!
We love you!

283
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:32,416
What a bunch of losers.
I need a break.

284
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,833
I swear, I'm a business genius!

285
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:36,291
From now on, these
two hotties are gonna

286
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:38,291
do all of my
promotions and events!

287
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:41,291
What better way to kick off
Christmas than a live concert?!

288
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:42,875
Oh yeah, this rocks!

289
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:44,291
This show is so bad ass!

290
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:47,500
Tops off! Tops off!

291
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,791
This is pretty amazing.

292
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,208
I know. We're
totally pop stars!

293
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:52,750
Sir, I've got a good idea!

294
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:54,166
I go by 'Producer' now.

295
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,166
Whatever you say,
Mr. Producer sir!

296
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,166
In all of this excitement I
think you might have forgotten

297
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,875
about your top secret weapon!

298
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:08,458
Put me in producer Daddy,
Shusuke's ready to get down!

299
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:11,208
Good call, son, people have
been asking for that lately.

300
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:11,875
Get off the stage!

301
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:12,958
Take it easy, guys!

302
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:15,666
Come on; don't knock it
till you try it!

303
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,666
Shusuke, get back
to work right now!

304
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:18,791
Peace, yo!

305
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:27,250
I mean, really. These people.

306
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:29,958
But Kinako, you quit working
here to study for your exams,

307
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,541
didn't you?

308
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,541
If you come here every day and
goof around, what's the point?

309
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:35,333
Aww, c'mon don't say that.

310
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:37,625
Besides, I brought something
with me to read today,

311
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:38,875
check it out.

312
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,166
Oh, right.
That just went on sale.

313
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:42,708
Yep, it sure did.

314
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:46,583
And that review you wrote on
Hiyoko's book is featured in it.

315
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,416
See, look. It's right here.

316
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,083
Oh yeah. Wow.
I'll read it out loud.

317
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:53,166
"If I had to compare this
book to something I'd say

318
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:56,000
it's like a nice stroll
along a nature trail."

319
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:58,416
"The visual imagery that emerges
from the matter of fact

320
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,166
depiction exudes emotional
sentiment and depth."

321
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,833
Stop it, you're
embarrassing me.

322
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:04,916
It's weird hearing
someone else read my words.

323
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,750
"The material may be
difficult to approach,

324
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:08,333
but once you've committed,
you'll be hooked and

325
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:10,666
the deeper significance
will reveal itself".

326
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:11,500
How 'bout that?

327
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:12,750
Well, whaddaya think?

328
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,875
You've got a real talent
for delivering praise!

329
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:16,750
It's true, I thought
the exact same thing!

330
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:17,958
Wow, thanks a lot!

331
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:19,500
As a matter of fact,
your write-up makes me

332
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:22,250
want to go out and pick up
a copy of the book right now!

333
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:24,041
That's the whole point,
you totally should!

334
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:26,750
Nah. Once I read it,
I'll just be disappointed.

335
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,041
Huh, why is that?

336
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:33,625
Well, because I don't wanna read
a story about some old geezer.

337
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:35,708
Oh no, there's a lot more to it.

338
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:38,250
Trust me, once you get into the
story you won't put it down,

339
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:40,166
it's like sipping
a fine wine or something.

340
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,416
Whaddaya think, Kinako?

341
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,416
Well, I don't know.

342
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:47,416
Umm, I thought her last book was
entertaining and fun to read.

343
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:51,375
But to be honest, this one
just isn't my cup of tea.

344
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:52,791
And besides.

345
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:55,083
If you are gonna have an old man
as your main character.

346
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:58,000
You at least have to flesh it
out by making him realistic.

347
00:13:58,083 --> 00:14:00,041
Hers was one dimensional,
and it was clearly written

348
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:01,208
by young person.

349
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:02,916
Yeah but,
she is a young person,

350
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,791
she can't do
anything about that.

351
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:07,583
Plus, as a writer, I think her
desire to explore new frontiers

352
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:09,458
and try something outside
of her comfort zone

353
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:10,958
shows a lot of promise.

354
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:13,916
Desire alone isn't what
sells books, and you know it.

355
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,583
Right?

356
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:15,666
No one is buying it.

357
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:16,666
Isn't that true?

358
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,000
Well, uh-

359
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:19,291
So maybe she should stop
over-reaching and go back

360
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:21,000
to writing romantic
comedies for younger girls

361
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:22,666
like she did before.

362
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:25,083
That's the stuff
people wanna read anyway.

363
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:27,708
Hiyoko?

364
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:29,666
You didn't hear our
conversation, did you?

365
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,166
Thank you very much.

366
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,791
I will take your feedback
and constructive criticisms

367
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:35,708
to heart in my future writings.

368
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:36,208
Uh...

369
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:37,250
Sure thing.

370
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:39,041
And there goes
that attitude again.

371
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:41,458
I have no idea
what you mean by that?

372
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:43,625
Come on, you can't
play stupid with me.

373
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:45,208
Oh well.

374
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:47,083
I guess the days of you being
fun to be around are long gone,

375
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:48,208
aren't they?

376
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:53,083
If you'll excuse me.

377
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:54,666
Hiyoko, wait!

378
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:57,333
Look, there might have been
a few parts that bothered me.

379
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:59,250
But still, I liked it.

380
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:00,666
It's a really great book!

381
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,041
Don't be discouraged.

382
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:03,541
Keep writing.

383
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:08,333
That was so rude.

384
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:11,166
There's a much nicer way to give
someone criticism, you know?

385
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,458
Please, she'll be fine.
You have to be blunt with her,

386
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:15,875
it's the only thing
she responds to.

387
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,166
Yeah but still.

388
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,916
Your critiques on her book
were pretty specific

389
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,375
and very well thought out.

390
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:21,500
You read it closely.

391
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:22,708
Nah.

392
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:41,833
You guys. I gotta
be honest with you,

393
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:44,583
if we don't find it soon,
I'm afraid it'll never turn up!

394
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:46,208
No, we have to keep looking!

395
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:48,458
--We can't give up yet!
--Hey! There you are!

396
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:53,791
So, what is it?

397
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:56,125
Whaddaya want? This better
not be a waste of our time,

398
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:57,416
or I'll make you regret it.

399
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,708
You guys are looking
for Naru's bicycle, right?

400
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:01,000
Well, I think I found it!

401
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:04,208
Look, Naru, this is totally it.

402
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:06,666
Looks like our search
is finally over, huh?!

403
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:10,291
Oh. It is the right color.
But that's not my bike.

404
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:11,791
No? Are you sure?

405
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:13,625
Absolutely.
They're very similar,

406
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:15,166
but this one isn't right.

407
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:18,041
I mean, for one thing mine's got
a backrest behind the seat.

408
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:20,458
I could've sworn this was it.

409
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:23,083
By the way Ai, why are you out
here looking for her bike,

410
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:24,291
what's in it for you?

411
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:26,458
There's nothing in it
for me, thank you.

412
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:28,250
Other than giving
a hand to a good friend

413
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:29,958
who obviously
needs a little help.

414
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:32,375
And besides we are the
neighborhood watch group.

415
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:35,458
Yanigahara Flame Birdes
to the rescue!

416
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:37,291
Stop right there, loser town!

417
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,583
Check yourself
before you wreck yourself!

418
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:40,250
Oh Great.

419
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,208
Eww. Yuk.

420
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:44,833
Lock up your daughters
and hide yo mammas folks

421
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:46,750
cause R-Wing's here
to rock tha house!

422
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:48,250
Beat it you jackwads!

423
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:50,166
Take it easy there, pretty boy.

424
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,416
We're not here to get in your
way, so just calm down,

425
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,083
all right?

426
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:54,291
It's all good.

427
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:55,916
As a matter of fact,
we want to thank you.

428
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,041
Hey there, man.
Dark and angry.

429
00:16:58,125 --> 00:16:59,083
Me?

430
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:01,875
Yeah! You're Hayato
Narita, right?

431
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:03,291
You're the one who kicked
the livin' crap out of

432
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:05,250
the Archbishop
for us, aren't you?!

433
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:07,416
Yeah. So what?

434
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,000
We just wanna say thanks.

435
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:11,750
That guy was starting to rub us
the wrong way to say the least.

436
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:13,125
 Yeah.

437
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:14,541
But since you beat him down
and dropped the hammer

438
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:17,166
on that evil scumbag,
you have to take his place.

439
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,375
You're the chosen one who's
been sent here to lead us

440
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:21,083
to a new paradise.

441
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:23,208
Hayato! You are
the coolest, man!

442
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:24,791
You mind if
I call you 'my bro'?

443
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:26,208
Please! Pretty please!

444
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:28,291
I mind a lot, actually.

445
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:31,375
All right then, but we all owe
you big time for doing that.

446
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:33,708
As thanks, how about we
help you look for that bike?

447
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:37,333
After everything you've done for
us, it's the least we can do.

448
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:39,916
Hey bro. You just take it
easy and enjoy hangin' out

449
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,666
with those two pretty ladies;
we've got it covered from here!

450
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,541
What's up with
those freakin' weirdos?

451
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:47,083
Whoa. Did you hear that?

452
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:48,583
Yeah, of course I did.

453
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:50,958
We'd better get going and
tell LR and the others!

454
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:52,541
Looks like it's
us against them.

455
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:54,250
There's no way in hell
I'm gonna let those jerks

456
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:55,375
find that bike first!

457
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:56,250
Damn right.

458
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:58,291
YFB versus R-Wing, round two.

459
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:00,416
This is our chance
to show those jerks who's boss.

460
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,166
Yeah, I can't wait!

461
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,708
You two wait for us
at Pal Crepe.

462
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:06,833
We'll get in touch with you
the second we find it!

463
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:08,291
Right. We've got this!

464
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:09,291
Bye, bye!

465
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:10,750
Well, they're off
to the races.

466
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:13,291
Whatever, come on.
We should get going.

467
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:17,791
Wait a second, are you
absolutely sure about this boss?

468
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:20,166
The rest of the members are
out looking for Naru's bike.

469
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,583
Of course I am.

470
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:23,916
At least it'll kill
a little bit of time, right?

471
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,375
Yes sir.

472
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,208
 How 'bout that.

473
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:32,291
Finding your bike's turned into
quite an ordeal, hasn't it?

474
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:33,500
Sure has.

475
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:35,000
It's weird. I wanna
know why these losers

476
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:36,750
have so much time
on their hands.

477
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:38,875
What does it matter?
At least it's healthier

478
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:41,291
than shooting each other
under overpasses, right?

479
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:44,375
They find bike, Naru.
They find it for certain.

480
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:46,916
Hope so. Thanks for
the support, Alice.

481
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,750
Hey. Wait.

482
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:49,208
What's up?

483
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:51,916
I don't understand. What's
so special about that bike?

484
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,833
If you can't find it, why don't
we just get you a new one?

485
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:57,041
The truth is,
it's not the bike I want.

486
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:58,750
I mean, the bike's great,
but there's something

487
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:01,000
in the front basket
I really need to get back.

488
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:03,500
It must be something
that's very important to you.

489
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:06,000
Oh yeah. I have
to have my pager.

490
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:07,625
What's pager?

491
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:08,500
Lame.

492
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:09,958
There's nothing lame about it!

493
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:12,125
Pocket-bell pagers are
the best; I've used them

494
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:13,666
since I was a little kid.

495
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:16,000
Let's see, how can
I put this delicately:

496
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:17,708
No one uses pagers anymore.

497
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:19,333
Yeah.

498
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:21,375
Don't you think it's about time
you upgraded to a cell phone?

499
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:22,875
People are going to think
there's something wrong

500
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:24,625
with you if you
keep using that.

501
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:26,875
That's okay,
I don't need a cell phone.

502
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:28,500
I don't have any
friends to text,

503
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:30,583
call or email with, anyway.

504
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:32,916
And besides,
I love it so much.

505
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,333
That pager was
a gift from my mother.

506
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:39,916
Things were always rocky
at home and so, growing up,

507
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,708
I had to live
apart from my mom.

508
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:44,916
I missed her a whole lot,
but she gave me that pager,

509
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
it's the only way that we
can keep in touch, ya know?

510
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:51,083
I see.

511
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,208
Hey, Drac.

512
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:56,625
Get out there
and find that thing.

513
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:58,541
No matter what
it takes, you hear me?

514
00:19:58,625 --> 00:19:59,375
Done.

515
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:02,625
I will tell papa
about it as well.

516
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:05,875
And then. We will find
beeping device because.

517
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:07,291
The nation need know.

518
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:09,166
Uh, I really don't see
how this is a matter

519
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,750
of international concern.

520
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:14,958
You wrong. Big time crime
lord peoples are behind this

521
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:17,500
for definite,
I know it to be true.

522
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:18,583
Huh?

523
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:20,166
I see them do
their badness before.

524
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,458
A grouping of bad men
that park in front of Jim's

525
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:24,583
stand and load up bunches
of wheely bikes into

526
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:26,625
pick-up trucks and
steal them all away.

527
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:28,166
Oh, no, no, no.

528
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,333
They're not crime lords,
they work for the city.

529
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:31,750
That's just what they do.

530
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:34,333
Their job is to pick up
abandoned objects like bicycles

531
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:37,041
so the streets aren't
all cluttered with stuff.

532
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:39,375
Hey, they sweep the streets
quite a bit, don't they?

533
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:41,458
They do? I didn't know that.

534
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:46,458
Naru. You did check with
the city ward's office

535
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:48,250
to see if they
have your bike, right?

536
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:50,625
No. I gotta be honest,
I didn't even know

537
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,458
the city ward's office existed.

538
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:53,250
Seriously.

539
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:54,583
Well.

540
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:56,416
I guess that was a really
stupid move on my part.

541
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:59,083
What is city ward?

542
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:04,291
Come on now, sun,
that's just ridiculous.

543
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:06,416
You're seriously getting
on my nerves, buddy.

544
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,375
Still, I think it's kinda nice.

545
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:09,958
Huh? What is?

546
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:12,458
Oh, you know, getting to spend
some time with you like this.

547
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:14,166
Yeah. If you say so.

548
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:20,041
Hey! This is it! This
is my bicycle! Wow!

549
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:24,041
Uh-oh.

550
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:26,166
I just realized we forgot to
get in touch with the others.

551
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,583
It's over, losers!

552
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:29,791
Haven't you scumbags
given up yet?!

553
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:32,958
You are sadly
mistaken douche-bag!

554
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,333
Admit defeat!

555
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:36,666
What? There's no way
you could ever beat us!

556
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:39,000
Oh yeah? Bring it on!

557
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:42,083
--You're going down, R-Wing!
--You're going down, YFB!

558
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:45,000
It's here! Now that I've
got you back in my arms,

559
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:47,291
I'm never letting you
outta my sight ever again,

560
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:48,625
--no matter what!
--Good for you.

561
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:50,375
Hey! It means a lot to me

562
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:53,541
that you went out of
your way to help me find it!

563
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:55,916
Well, uh. It's no big deal.

564
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:00,000
What's wrong?

565
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:02,500
Oh. It's nothing really.

566
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,541
All right. Tell the truth.

567
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:10,208
You got another message,
didn't you?

568
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:11,958
What'd it say;
I'm just dyin to know!

569
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:17,125
Oh. You are? Well, then.
How about this?

570
00:22:17,208 --> 00:22:19,500
We'll race back and
if you win, I'll tell.

571
00:22:19,583 --> 00:22:21,083
Hey! Wait!

572
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:22,916
You know there's no way
I can beat you on foot!

573
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,250
Plus, I'm way out of shape
and I really hate running!

574
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:26,833
Come back here!

575
00:22:26,916 --> 00:22:29,250
Then I guess you'll never know;
hey maybe you should get a bike!

576
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:30,666
That's it!

577
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,583
Then we could all go out
and ride our bicycles together.

578
00:22:32,666 --> 00:22:35,208
We'll invite Ai,
and the Crepe Lady...

579
00:22:35,291 --> 00:22:39,166
Ah, man. Slow down a little,
will ya? I'm gonna puke!

580
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:41,916
Wow, it's gonna be so much
fun! Where should we go?

581
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Hayato, where do you
think we should go?!

582
00:22:44,083 --> 00:22:45,875
If I don't stop running,
I'm not going anywhere

583
00:22:45,958 --> 00:22:47,375
cause I'm about
to friggin' drop dead!

584
00:22:47,458 --> 00:22:49,250
Oh, you're such a silly boy!

585
00:22:49,333 --> 00:22:51,083
I love hanging out with you!

586
00:24:23,125 --> 00:24:25,208
I'm now accepting
your CONDORlences.

587
00:24:25,291 --> 00:24:27,625
This is the late DJ Condor
still coming at you today

588
00:24:27,708 --> 00:24:29,125
from the depths of Naraku.

589
00:24:29,208 --> 00:24:31,541
The Condor's the only DJ
that can spin great records

590
00:24:31,625 --> 00:24:32,791
from the great beyond.

591
00:24:32,875 --> 00:24:34,666
So send me your letters
of CONDORlence and when

592
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:36,708
you visit my grave,
make sure you bring flowers.
