1
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:27,291
Okay, why not?

2
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:28,916
Go out with me!

3
00:00:36,041 --> 00:00:37,500
So, you're Takashi, right?

4
00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:39,208
I'm Asuka Watarai.

5
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:40,458
It's nice to meet you.

6
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:40,958
Yeah.

7
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,208
Same to you.

8
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:44,250
So where exactly were
you wanting to go today?

9
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:44,958
Movies?

10
00:00:45,041 --> 00:00:46,750
OB GYN appointment?

11
00:00:46,833 --> 00:00:49,375
Or maybe just
a little shopping?

12
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:50,583
That's not what I meant!

13
00:00:50,666 --> 00:00:52,083
Um, I was trying
to tell you that I like you

14
00:00:52,166 --> 00:00:53,208
and I want to be with you.

15
00:00:53,291 --> 00:00:54,791
But I chose
the wrong words, I guess!

16
00:00:54,875 --> 00:00:55,833
That makes sense!

17
00:00:55,916 --> 00:00:56,625
Thought so!

18
00:00:56,708 --> 00:00:57,500
Well, see ya!

19
00:00:57,583 --> 00:00:58,041
Uh.

20
00:00:58,125 --> 00:00:59,000
Just a second!

21
00:00:59,083 --> 00:01:00,083
Yeah?

22
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:01,375
Well.

23
00:01:01,458 --> 00:01:03,750
Uh, I don't want you
to freak out or anything,

24
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:06,458
but I think people have
the wrong idea about us.

25
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:07,583
They-

26
00:01:07,666 --> 00:01:08,958
They think you're
my boyfriend, right?

27
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:11,916
Yeah, um, I'm sorry.

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,500
Wait!

29
00:01:12,583 --> 00:01:13,625
You knew?!

30
00:01:13,708 --> 00:01:14,583
Then why didn't you-?

31
00:01:14,666 --> 00:01:16,208
Because I'm awesome like that.

32
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:17,833
I knew if people
thought we were together

33
00:01:17,916 --> 00:01:19,583
then they wouldn't
pick on you so much.

34
00:01:19,666 --> 00:01:20,958
Pick on me?

35
00:01:21,041 --> 00:01:21,958
Oh, sorry.

36
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:23,333
They weren't
trying to be jerks.

37
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:25,583
It was all in good fun,
I promise.

38
00:01:25,666 --> 00:01:28,250
That's just how I joke with
my friends sometimes, y'know?

39
00:01:28,333 --> 00:01:30,583
Then I guess this
just got a little awkward.

40
00:01:30,666 --> 00:01:31,541
Sorry.

41
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:32,208
Please.

42
00:01:32,291 --> 00:01:34,166
Don't apologize.

43
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:36,208
Wait, why aren't you
freaking out right now?

44
00:01:36,291 --> 00:01:38,791
People are saying some
messed up things about you!

45
00:01:40,666 --> 00:01:41,375
I see.

46
00:01:41,458 --> 00:01:42,666
There's somebody else?

47
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:45,250
Um, no, not even
close to that.

48
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:46,708
Well that's a relief!

49
00:01:46,791 --> 00:01:49,500
So, we can keep things as
they are for awhile, right?

50
00:01:49,583 --> 00:01:52,041
I mean, yeah?

51
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:53,500
And that was that.

52
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:55,875
It's been a little over
two years since Takashi Haneda

53
00:01:55,958 --> 00:01:58,708
and Asuka Watarai
began their little romance,

54
00:01:58,791 --> 00:02:00,458
if you can even call it that.

55
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:58,166
I saw that!

56
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:58,791
Oh, please.

57
00:03:58,875 --> 00:03:59,958
I don't buy it.

58
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:01,458
You were looking up
her skirt just now.

59
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,208
It was obvious.

60
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:08,500
I was not.

61
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:09,708
You're making that up!

62
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:10,500
What?!

63
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:11,750
Are you calling me a liar?

64
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:13,375
You trying to say
I'm seeing things?

65
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:16,208
Yeah, is that why you're about
to piss yourself, Pervert?

66
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:19,208
Well, you don't
have to convince me.

67
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:21,250
I mean, unless you were
checking me out, too.

68
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:22,750
In which case, no thanks.

69
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:24,125
You're not my type.

70
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:28,541
No.

71
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:29,916
You've got it wrong.

72
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,958
I wasn't looking at anyone.

73
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:35,583
Liar!

74
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:39,666
This is not the most
ideal time to be summoned.

75
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,166
I've got to clear up this
misunderstanding first.

76
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,958
What's going on over here?

77
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:46,583
 Is there a problem?

78
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,375
I caught this jerk
looking up your skirt

79
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:51,666
while you were walking.

80
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,791
What?!

81
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:53,958
Not true.

82
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:55,166
He said it's 'not true.'

83
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,416
Of course he did!

84
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,041
No perv is ever gonna
come out and say 'yup!

85
00:04:58,125 --> 00:04:59,250
You caught me.'

86
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:01,666
Even if it was true,
it wouldn't bother me.

87
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:05,541
Meet my boyfriend.

88
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:07,708
Huh?!

89
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:08,583
Hey.

90
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:09,750
What's up? 

91
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:12,291
Sorry for the confusion,
but thanks anyway!

92
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:15,250
Uh, no, I should
be apologizing.

93
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:16,583
Forgive me.

94
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:19,000
That's very nice,
but he's the one you insulted.

95
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:19,583
Right.

96
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:21,083
This sucks.

97
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:22,666
I'm very sorry!

98
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:31,750
You know that's why people
think you're a push-over?

99
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,375
I mean, do you ever get mad?

100
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:34,583
Of course I do.

101
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:36,250
But he was only trying
to look out for you.

102
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:38,458
I mean, what if I
really was looking?

103
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:40,041
Yeah right.

104
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,250
Oh well. I guess it's all
just part of your charm.

105
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:51,083
Tell the truth.

106
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:52,875
Did you see them?

107
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:54,083
You're dead if you did.

108
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:56,833
And I'll know if
you're lying to me about it.

109
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:58,875
You're really close
to me right now.

110
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:06,500
Hey, Haneda!

111
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:08,500
 Oh, hey Miss Takauchi!

112
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:11,916
This whole 'graduation essay'
thing has me really bummed out.

113
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,083
Teach said we had
to start prepping for them.

114
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,041
So, how far have you
gotten or have you

115
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,375
just been dickin' around?

116
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:18,250
Oh.

117
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:20,291
I guess, I haven't started yet.

118
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:21,500
Yeah, I figured.

119
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:23,041
We need to have
a class meeting or something

120
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:24,875
and make a plan--I don't want
to be stressing about this

121
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:25,875
last minute.

122
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:27,250
Yeah, I agree.

123
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:29,041
So let's find a place
to hang out at after school

124
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:30,375
and talk about it?

125
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:32,291
You want to go some place
after school and 'talk?'

126
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:34,458
You mean like your
house?! The hell?!

127
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:37,000
Are you trying
to get me to bang you?

128
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:40,125
That was some good
strategy tho, almost had me...

129
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:43,375
We would've been all alone
at your place and then- Wait.

130
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:46,208
You dick, I'm not gonna
be your stand-in Asuka!

131
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:47,250
You're totally wrong!

132
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:48,916
I have no desire
to do that with you!

133
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,625
Oh really!

134
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:51,083
Then do it by yourself!

135
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:52,416
That's not what I meant.

136
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,833
Not to mention,
you're a class officer so-

137
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:55,541
Nah.

138
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:56,333
It's whatever.

139
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,541
I've got my hands full.

140
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,291
I gotta write stuff
on the board and shop.

141
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:00,375
This is all you.

142
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:01,458
Good luck!

143
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:02,458
Wait!

144
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:03,916
So you're not
even gonna help?!

145
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,791
It's sick how easy
you got out of that!

146
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:07,750
Yeah, I'm a little
jealous--not gonna lie!

147
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:08,916
What do you mean?

148
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,625
That was crafty delegation.

149
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:13,666
Again so soon?

150
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:18,041
Man, I guess they must
really need me right now.

151
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:23,666
Huh?

152
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,583
Where am I?

153
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:27,041
I see.

154
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:29,916
The court summoner has
requested my presence.

155
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,166
The war has begun.

156
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,875
Lord Hawk!

157
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:35,208
Lord Hawk has
finally returned!

158
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:37,291
We've been waitin'
for you, Sir Hawk!

159
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:38,625
Welcome back!

160
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:41,541
Sir Pegasus,
you've done quite well

161
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:43,583
protecting Beltmond
in my absence.

162
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:45,583
You have my utmost gratitude.

163
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:48,875
At last you return
to us, Hawk Cyan-Blue.

164
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,541
Princess Asuka!

165
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:57,625
Successor to the royal
bloodline of Gretagard

166
00:07:57,708 --> 00:08:00,333
and our sole princess,
how great to see you.

167
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:02,125
I am overjoyed.

168
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,791
I, Sir Hawk Cyan-Blue, have
returned and am at your service.

169
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:10,333
I pray thee, tell me true:

170
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:13,166
what errors have occurred during
my absence, Sweet Princess?

171
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,166
It is the army of the
evil realm being led

172
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,125
by the hateful
Yokujin soldiers.

173
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:19,791
They are moving quickly
toward the north forest.

174
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:22,166
The goblin and orc ground
forces have also begun

175
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,416
to advance.

176
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,208
This war is not
progressing well, I'm afraid.

177
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:27,541
Goblins?

178
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:29,541
But what of our
army's reinforcements?

179
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:32,333
My heart weighs heavily,
but it is you.

180
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:35,750
You are our last reinforcement
and regretfully our only hope.

181
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:36,750
It's true.

182
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:38,458
Even the Four Feathers
have gone.

183
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:39,958
Our successors.

184
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:43,083
What is to become of the throne
if we do not survive this?

185
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:44,958
Garuda the Wise
has been captured,

186
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:46,541
and both
"The Eternal Wing" Eagle

187
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:48,416
and "Lord of the Underworld"
Falcon have been missing

188
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,083
for quite some time now.

189
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:51,458
We are falling apart.

190
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:52,958
And our land.

191
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:55,791
All that remains are the remote
areas of the countryside!

192
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:57,291
Good fortune is with us.

193
00:08:57,375 --> 00:08:59,416
We now have the strongest
warrior of the Four Feathers

194
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,291
of ten thousand Colors,
the Golden Hawk, our friend,

195
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,208
Hawk Cyan-Blue!

196
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:07,125
I await your orders,
my lovely princess.

197
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:08,958
Sir Hawk.

198
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:13,333
I order you in the name
of Gretagard's royal family

199
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:15,250
to lend your
support to our allies.

200
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:17,958
Battle against the Yokujin
soldiers in the North Forest.

201
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:20,083
Our gratitude and
prayers are with you.

202
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:21,916
Leuchten Greta.

203
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:28,500
By the holy sword,
Gretacaliber, bestowed on me,

204
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:31,375
by His Majesty the King,
I vow to complete

205
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:34,708
the mission Princess
Asuka has appointed me!

206
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:38,208
Yeaaah!

207
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:41,625
My Brave Hawk Cyan-Blue,
fair well in battle,

208
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:44,833
but please stay strong for me.

209
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:47,333
My heart shall remain tortured
until you are safely returned

210
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:48,625
to my side.

211
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:04,041
Eagle, Falcon, Garuda.

212
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:05,458
I wonder.

213
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:09,500
Are we looking at the same
mournful stars this night?

214
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:12,833
O, that the world
may know peace.

215
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:19,250
I guess that means
I can definitely

216
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:21,666
be summoned at school.

217
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,625
I shouldn't be complaining.

218
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:26,541
I'm glad they know where
to find me when they need me.

219
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:35,333
Shit.

220
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:36,958
I'm sorry!

221
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:39,583
Where did you get it?

222
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:41,625
I'll go buy you
another one right now.

223
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:45,875
I know you.

224
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:47,916
Eh.

225
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,625
Um, you're Haryu, aren't you?

226
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:51,958
And you are?

227
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:53,875
Takashi Haneda from Class 3-A.

228
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:57,125
I'm an officer too,
for the class, 3A.

229
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:59,500
Takashi Haneda?

230
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:00,541
Right.

231
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:02,583
You're Asuka's friend,
aren't you?

232
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:10,000
I get it now.
It's all making sense.

233
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:11,666
That's what
caught Asuka's eye.

234
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,500
She's always had
quite the nose for it.

235
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:14,791
What does that even mean?

236
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:16,500
Huh? Oh.

237
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:18,916
Well, there's something
special about her,

238
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,708
but I'm sworn to secrecy,
so that's all I'm gonna say.

239
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:24,750
Things could
actually start to get

240
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:26,666
very interesting around here.

241
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,333
Damn.

242
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:32,958
No room for mistakes now,
but that can't be helped.

243
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:34,541
I might as well just
slit open your stomach

244
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:36,458
and dig out that
gem you swallowed.

245
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:38,166
What do you say, Pal?

246
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:41,583
Totally kidding.

247
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:43,458
So, are you saying
that you and Asuka-?

248
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:46,625
I said I can't talk
about that, didn't I?

249
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:49,375
Oh, right, I remember.

250
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:53,541
You know, the fact that
Asuka has chosen you

251
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:57,458
arouses my curiosity.
But on a more personal level-

252
00:11:57,541 --> 00:12:00,333
I'm sorry, but you are
not worthy of any feeling

253
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:02,500
I may have, aside from apathy.

254
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:05,625
I find your lack
of courage insulting.

255
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:08,166
No. Wait, I take it back.

256
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:12,375
I do feel something for you:
you make me want to vomit.

257
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:14,250
All over your face.

258
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:36,583
Not again.
What is going on today?

259
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:43,875
Behold!

260
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:46,333
Towering before us is the most
impregnable Zwei Fortress.

261
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:48,625
Above us, a thousand
yokujin soldiers!

262
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:51,166
On the ground,
ten thousand monsters!

263
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:54,916
Yet we fear not;
for we have Hawk on our side!

264
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,958
We give our glory to Gretagard!

265
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:58,083
Leuchten Greta!

266
00:12:58,166 --> 00:13:02,416
Sir Hawk!

267
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,375
Isn't it amazing how quickly
we've amassed this many allies?

268
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:07,833
Every last person here holds
you in the highest regard.

269
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:10,500
Surely you know by now you are
like a savior in their eyes.

270
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:12,083
You flatter me, Pegasus.

271
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,958
Though I've been honored with
the title 'Wings of Gold'

272
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:16,583
long enough, it still makes
me feel shy to receive

273
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:18,666
such praise in
front of so many.

274
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,583
Even so, I am grateful for
your kindness and generosity.

275
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:23,708
If there's one thing
we can't praise you for,

276
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:26,541
it's this modesty that
makes you blush like a lady.

277
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:29,791
Yet, strangely it's one of the
traits I admire most about you.

278
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:30,666
Ah!

279
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:31,916
Vernar, the "Arrow of Light!" 

280
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,166
How about that!

281
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,000
The lone warrior of the
mountains who is known

282
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:37,250
for his isolation
has joined our ranks!

283
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:40,041
Only the honored Hawk
has that sort of power!

284
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:41,833
Can it be that he
also brought Andre,

285
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:43,083
the "White Flame" with him!

286
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:45,541
How noble you are, Sir,
to leave the front line

287
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:48,000
your land and commander
just to fight with us!

288
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:50,666
Our Sir Hawk is a man
of virtue and honor, indeed!

289
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,833
Good-day Bard,
the Gale-Force Vassal!

290
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:54,333
It is an honor to be
serving with you.

291
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,583
T'is an honor that you have
joined us after suffering

292
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:58,500
the kidnapping of your
son which left you at

293
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:00,291
the mercy of our enemy.

294
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:03,041
Our Sir Hawk is a pillar
of honor and virtue.

295
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:04,166
You heard them!

296
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,708
We are all prepared
to join in battle!

297
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:07,416
And we shall follow you
to the depths of Hell

298
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,291
if you command it!

299
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:09,125
Sir Hawk!

300
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:10,000
Sir Hawk!

301
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,375
Praise Sir Hawk!

302
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:12,041
Sir Hawk!

303
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:12,791
Sir Hawk!

304
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:14,500
Praise Sir Hawk!

305
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:15,250
Sir Hawk!

306
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:15,875
Sir Hawk!

307
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:17,250
All hands, charge!

308
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:40,708
The time between the summonings
is getting shorter every day.

309
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:44,208
I can't control
the time or location.

310
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:47,208
Maybe the end is near.

311
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:49,208
So I have to be ready.

312
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:52,541
What are you doing?

313
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,625
I'm cold!

314
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:56,500
Shut the door!

315
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:57,583
Sorry!

316
00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:59,250
I didn't even
notice you were there.

317
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,583
Brother!?!

318
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:03,750
Why do you always
have to be so mean?!

319
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:05,750
I can't see,
let me get the light.

320
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:09,416
It's too bright in here!

321
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,250
I'm so sorry!

322
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:12,166
I just- I'm turning it off!

323
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:15,708
What happened?

324
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:17,000
Damn it, Kobato!

325
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,416
Put on your clothes!

326
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,750
Clothes?

327
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:21,916
Why?

328
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,666
What do you mean, "why?"
I'm not interested

329
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,625
in seeing my sister naked.

330
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:27,333
Sorry if that's weird to you.

331
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:32,708
So, did you see me?

332
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:33,541
No.

333
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:34,750
Thankfully I wasn't looking.

334
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:37,750
Oh, good.

335
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:39,833
I was worried.

336
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:45,125
So, you should
hurry up and change.

337
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:47,166
Uh, yeah, I know.

338
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,333
I was going to.

339
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:49,750
Good...

340
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:51,708
I mean, you don't want
to catch a cold or anything...

341
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:53,250
It's going around, I hear.

342
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:54,375
Thank you.

343
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:55,791
I'll be careful.

344
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:56,791
Right.

345
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:00,458
'Kay.

346
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:01,375
Bye.

347
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:03,000
Bye.

348
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:04,958
I mean, Good night.

349
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:07,458
That's how it's been
lately between me

350
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:09,666
and my sister--kinda awkward.

351
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:12,666
You'd think we were strangers
but we see each other every day.

352
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:15,958
It feels more like we're
distant cousins than siblings.

353
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:17,500
I bet she wouldn't
even notice or care

354
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:19,500
if I wasn't here anymore.

355
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:29,916
Haneda residence.

356
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,791
I'm so sorry for
calling this late.

357
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:33,208
This is Asuka Watarai.

358
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:35,041
I'm a friend
of Takashi's from school.

359
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:36,208
Is he up by any chance?

360
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:37,333
Can I talk to him?

361
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:42,916
And that's about it.

362
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,291
You are a rockstar.

363
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:44,833
Thanks!

364
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:45,666
Sure.

365
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:46,666
You always study this late?

366
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,125
I'm surprised you called.

367
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:49,500
Is it really that weird?

368
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:52,250
I mean, I'm allowed to call
my boyfriend, aren't I?

369
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:52,750
So.

370
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:53,500
We're still?

371
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:54,583
Of course.

372
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:56,625
I mean, unless you
met someone else?

373
00:16:58,708 --> 00:16:59,708
Seriously?

374
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:01,666
You haven't met
anyone else you like?

375
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,625
You're not blowing off other
girls because of me, are you?

376
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:06,333
You're not
obligated or anything.

377
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:08,166
We can break up
whenever you want.

378
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:10,666
Not that it'll be
the easiest thing.

379
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,750
I may actually be
a little sad about it.

380
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:14,333
Hello?

381
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:15,125
Are you still there?

382
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:16,000
Takashi?

383
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:16,500
Me?

384
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:17,083
Yeah.

385
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:17,791
I'm here.

386
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:21,375
What's the deal--have
you met someone new?

387
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:23,333
Prob'ly not.

388
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:25,666
I guess a girlfriend shouldn't
be asking things like that.

389
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:26,291
Uh.

390
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:27,583
It's kinda weird.

391
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:30,041
Well, whatever.

392
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:31,833
Thanks for all
your help. 'Night!

393
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:32,291
Oh.

394
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:32,958
Sure.

395
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:33,916
Good night.

396
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:47,666
She said she'd be sad
if we ever broke up.

397
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,541
I guess disappearing
from this world would qualify.

398
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:57,083
I wish that we would've
spent more time together.

399
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:04,500
Like I said, we're gonna
need everyone's help.

400
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:05,333
Come on guys.

401
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:06,583
Listen, please.

402
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:10,666
That's all!

403
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,000
Thanks for playing, you guys!

404
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:16,791
But, you just let them
go without finishing.

405
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:19,208
There was no way to get it done
before the semester was over.

406
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:21,041
So thanks for
a whole lot of nothing.

407
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:22,083
I'm sorry.

408
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:23,583
--Gah.
--Wow.

409
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:25,875
How does somebody so useless
become the class President?

410
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:49,125
You again?

411
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:51,458
Yes, Hawk Cyan-Blue.

412
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:52,166
I know you!

413
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,500
You're Princess Asuka's-

414
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:55,041
Yes.

415
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:59,291
She has bid me good favor to
allow me to wait on her daily.

416
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:01,291
I know your heart
belongs to the princess;

417
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:03,708
therefore I pray you'll
forgive my fervent request.

418
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:05,083
Show me your kindness.

419
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:07,208
Gaze upon me as you
do her for just as long

420
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:09,541
as the clouds shall
cover the moon.

421
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,458
O beautiful handmaiden,
if fortune does not allow me

422
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:17,375
to know your name,
how can I-

423
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:19,583
I won't hear any more!

424
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:21,083
You can!

425
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:25,875
Imagine it, our hearts changed.

426
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:29,416
And your affection
bestowed upon me alone.

427
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,666
I beg of you Sir Hawk!

428
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,041
You must stop!

429
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:35,666
I cannot- I mustn't-

430
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,916
Wow, those are pretty awesome.

431
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,333
Oh, compared to Asuka's?

432
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:40,666
Is that what
you're trying to say?

433
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,000
Of course not!

434
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:43,333
I haven't ever been
close enough to her to know

435
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:44,250
what they look like!

436
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:45,458
I like that story.

437
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:46,666
Good, there's still
a chance that I might

438
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,916
be able to get some!

439
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,333
Yeah, I don't know.

440
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:52,708
That might not be the
best idea for a lot of reasons.

441
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:54,041
The hell?!

442
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:55,708
So you got me all hot
and bothered for nothing?!

443
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:57,875
Leave it to you to pull
a fake move like that!

444
00:19:57,958 --> 00:19:58,750
Please.

445
00:19:58,833 --> 00:19:59,958
You're one to talk about fake.

446
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:01,125
Can you say 'implants'?

447
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:02,375
Can you say A-hole?!

448
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:04,125
These are the real deal,
when you're ticked off

449
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:06,458
you say some
pretty rude-ass things.

450
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:08,083
I'm kinda into it.

451
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:08,916
You are?

452
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,250
That's good to know I guess.

453
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:11,583
Well.

454
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:13,958
It's true not everyone
likes traditional romance.

455
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:15,000
Never mind!

456
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:16,750
Forget what I said!

457
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:20,583
I misspoke, fair though you are,
I cannot return your affections.

458
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:23,541
You see my heart,
and my body have-

459
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:25,958
Nice try, but you've
already said it; I heard it;

460
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:27,583
it's out there and
you can't take it back!

461
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:28,541
That's unfortunate!

462
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:29,750
Hawk!

463
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,458
Why does everything
suck right now?

464
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:39,000
'Right now'
only lasts a moment.

465
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:41,375
So make your next one better.

466
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:42,541
Right.

467
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,041
See!

468
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:46,416
It already worked!

469
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:51,208
Done, now onto
the next moment!

470
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,000
And I think this one
should include me.

471
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:55,541
It doesn't have to be now,
but I want to go shopping.

472
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:57,833
What do you think?

473
00:20:57,916 --> 00:20:59,083
Yeah?

474
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:01,166
If not now, then when?

475
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,791
Um, I was hoping
to go kinda soon.

476
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:05,333
Is that okay?

477
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:05,875
Yeah.

478
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:06,833
Sure.

479
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:07,958
Oh good.

480
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:09,541
Thank you so much
for not saying 'no'.

481
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:11,083
I was a little worried.

482
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:12,166
I'd never say no!

483
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,000
Not to you!

484
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:14,333
Yeah.

485
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:15,708
Usually you just avoid me
so you don't ever have

486
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:17,000
to take me anywhere!

487
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:18,208
That's not always true.

488
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:19,541
For two years!

489
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:21,875
You've never once asked me
to do anything with you!

490
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:23,208
It makes me feel bad!

491
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:25,583
I shouldn't be the one
asking you out on dates!

492
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:26,916
Now wait a minute!

493
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,208
You were the one that said-

494
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:32,083
The thing is I don't actually
like being around people.

495
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:34,291
So the thought of dating
someone is a nightmare,

496
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:36,333
but if you're a girl who's
constantly turning every guy

497
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:39,083
down they start to hate on you,
so it's much easier if

498
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:41,250
they just think I have a
boyfriend and leave me alone.

499
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,541
Then there's no explaining.

500
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:45,333
You have got to be kidding me.

501
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:47,333
You're my boyfriend,
you are not the one who's

502
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:49,208
allowed to be afraid
of rejection.

503
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:50,625
Two years.

504
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:51,875
Two and a half!

505
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:53,291
If you want to take me
out then take me out!

506
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:55,291
And if you don't want
to see me anymore, that's fine!

507
00:21:55,375 --> 00:21:57,208
But at least have the balls
to tell me in person!

508
00:21:57,291 --> 00:21:58,166
Stop yelling.

509
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,250
I feel like yelling!

510
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:00,583
Deal with it!

511
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:02,250
You said you wanted people
to stay away from you.

512
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:03,541
You can't turn it
around and be mad

513
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:05,375
because I'm doing
what you said.

514
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:06,958
Oh, sure.

515
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:09,041
Take everything I said two years
ago and hold it over my head.

516
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:11,291
It's still true, though, right?

517
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:12,125
'Course not!

518
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:13,708
I'm a woman!

519
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:29,708
That the world may know peace.

520
00:22:29,791 --> 00:22:31,416
That the world may know peace.

521
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,291
That the world may know peace.

522
00:24:23,166 --> 00:24:24,041
Hey, Condor here.

523
00:24:24,125 --> 00:24:25,291
What's up?

524
00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:26,583
I wanted this week to be
a little more subdued.

525
00:24:26,666 --> 00:24:27,666
So that's why I invited-

526
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,333
The super Sexy Hawk Cyan-Blue!

527
00:24:29,416 --> 00:24:30,583
Thank you very much!

528
00:24:30,666 --> 00:24:32,000
Mr. Hawk, I must say,
excellent work today.

529
00:24:32,083 --> 00:24:33,458
Yes and I shall continue
to fight for peace

530
00:24:33,541 --> 00:24:34,958
in Gretagard next week as well!

531
00:24:35,041 --> 00:24:36,875
Actually, I don't think you'll
be joining us for awhile.
