1
00:00:15,958 --> 00:00:18,708
It sounded like a gunshot,
and when I turned around-

2
00:00:18,791 --> 00:00:20,500
What do you think happened?

3
00:00:20,583 --> 00:00:22,500
Some black dude got shot!

4
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:35,708
Alice.

5
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:36,541
Alice!

6
00:00:37,916 --> 00:00:39,208
Alice!

7
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:40,958
Drac!

8
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,791
Are you all right?

9
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:44,083
Bullets.

10
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:46,458
They shoot Mr. Marty!

11
00:00:48,666 --> 00:00:51,208
Martinez?!

12
00:00:51,291 --> 00:00:52,416
Who was it?!

13
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,000
I don't know him.

14
00:00:54,083 --> 00:00:56,791
He wear a hat on the head.

15
00:00:58,375 --> 00:01:01,125
Who would?

16
00:01:01,208 --> 00:01:03,916
A hat.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,333
A man in a hat.

18
00:01:06,416 --> 00:01:11,375
The hat man, he said-
I will kill Narita.

19
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,750
Son of a bitch!

20
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:11,125
There's no reason
to worry, the doctors said

21
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:12,791
he's gonna be just fine.

22
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:18,125
He's lucky that the bullet
didn't hit any organs.

23
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:21,125
He can check out of
the hospital in a few days.

24
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:22,875
I see.

25
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:23,750
And?

26
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:25,416
That's all you've got to say?

27
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,708
Jeez, Drac.

28
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:28,625
I thought you were
gonna blow a gasket earlier.

29
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,000
Yes.

30
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:33,041
In his belly, Drac had
very much firewood burning.

31
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:34,583
Firewood nothin'.

32
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:37,000
You couldn't see me anyway,
wench, you were too busy cryin'

33
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,041
your damn eyes out.

34
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:40,333
You are wrong, I cried none.

35
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,708
I am a cool keeper cutie!

36
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:44,000
Uh.

37
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:45,000
What the hell kinda'
language are you speaking?

38
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:45,833
Enunciate!

39
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:46,625
Ow!

40
00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:48,250
Don't pinfh, Miffer Drac!

41
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:49,791
Or no strif
rock-pafer-scissors!

42
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:51,041
Take it.

43
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:52,250
That'll teach ya' to lie!

44
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:54,666
Fine then, horse
around all you want.

45
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,458
The fact still remains that some
armed lunatic is on the loose,

46
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:59,333
running rampant in our city.

47
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:02,291
So for the time being,
don't stay out as late as usual.

48
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:03,416
Understood?

49
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,041
Yes, I understood
you clear and loud.

50
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:08,083
That goes for you too, Drac.

51
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:09,166
Huh?

52
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:13,083
What do I have
to worry ab-I hear ya.

53
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:23,791
Interesting, so the guy in
the hat is R-Wing's Archbishop.

54
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:25,208
Yeah.

55
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:28,083
And what's more, I doubt
this'll affect just you and me.

56
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:30,000
If we're not careful,
Takashi and Kobato

57
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:32,250
could be in trouble, too.

58
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:33,416
You think so?

59
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,041
That doesn't sound good!

60
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:37,958
We should've turned that
damn fruitcake in to the cops

61
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:40,333
when we had the chance!

62
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:44,333
That's enough,
Hayato, take it easy.

63
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:48,041
For now, let's just help
Takashi and the others, OK?

64
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:49,041
All right.

65
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:50,708
I'm being serious.

66
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,958
No running off and
making rash decisions...

67
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:57,458
Remember "That the world
may know peace", got me?

68
00:04:57,541 --> 00:04:58,791
Don't worry.

69
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:01,208
I made the old man a promise
I'm not gonna break.

70
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:10,041
Hey Karou, I think it's about
time to throw out all this smut.

71
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:12,083
"Smut?" Don't you mean "trash?"

72
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:17,166
Watch what you say,
'cause not all smut is trash!

73
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,250
Be a little more sensitive
with your vocabulary usage.

74
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:23,000
Damn kids these days, back in my
time, you'd dive into a river

75
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:25,791
just to fetch a porno mag
floating downstream!

76
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:27,791
Anyway, I'm taking this out.

77
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:37,583
Anyone out there?

78
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:41,541
--Guess not.
--Chitose?

79
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:44,333
I-is that you, Hiyoko?

80
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:46,541
Uh. Hello.

81
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,666
This is a surprise!

82
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,458
So what brings you here today?

83
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:55,125
I thought this was the day
that you usually take off.

84
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:58,375
Well- I just wanted
to check on your injury.

85
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:01,125
Injury? Oh, right, the injury!

86
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:03,250
It's fine,
I've got a thick skull!

87
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:04,458
Why do you ask?

88
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:06,250
So, Let me get this straight.

89
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:08,750
You're actually
worrying about me?

90
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:10,916
Yeah, don't flatter yourself!

91
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,541
It's just that you
got hurt protecting me.

92
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:20,875
And I feel
somewhat responsible.

93
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:23,833
So please, let me
help clean you up.

94
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:30,041
Hold still for me, please.

95
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:32,250
Uh- no problem.

96
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:38,041
Looks like the wound
still hasn't closed up.

97
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:43,625
I'll start off
by disinfecting the area.

98
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:46,666
Is this hurting you?

99
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,041
No, uh!

100
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:49,541
Go right ahead.

101
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:52,916
Try not to move around, k?

102
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,333
Whatever you say.

103
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:58,875
I don't know if I can take it!

104
00:06:58,958 --> 00:06:59,666
Oh God!

105
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:00,750
D-did I hurt you?

106
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:02,666
Sorry about that.

107
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,791
It's so moist and
sensitive right now.

108
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:08,041
"Moist and sensitive"!

109
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:10,750
Don't worry, I'll rub it
gently this time.

110
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:13,416
"Gently rubbing!"

111
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,375
I-is everything all right?

112
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:16,041
Um, yes!

113
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:18,208
Everything's peachy.

114
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:21,166
Looks like Karuo's influence
is rubbing off on me.

115
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:24,041
That's right, accept it!

116
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:27,125
Smut, trash, whatever,
you love it all!

117
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:30,250
Get ready,
I'm gonna keep going.

118
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:32,458
Oh n-no!

119
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:34,083
It's too much!

120
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,791
I'm all done now,
sorry it took so long.

121
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:42,041
Go ahead and sit up.

122
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:42,666
Wha?

123
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,375
Oh, right, gotcha.

124
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:46,291
The wrapping job's
kind of shoddy.

125
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:47,666
I guess I'm no doctor.

126
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,291
Nonsense,
thanks for the help!

127
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:50,833
You have truly moved me.

128
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:52,125
I think I might cry!

129
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:54,375
Well, it wasn't
that big of a deal.

130
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:55,916
What a modest caretaker!

131
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,500
This gauze, infused
with your incomparable TLC,

132
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:00,958
will no doubt protect me
from microscopic bacteria,

133
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:03,125
but also from
life's daily challenges!

134
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:05,041
Such a sweet gesture!

135
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:06,666
Don't exaggerate like that.

136
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,458
I'll treasure this day forever!

137
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:10,583
It's like I was meant
to get smacked in the head!

138
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:14,750
Hiyoko's love gauze
will never come off!

139
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:17,000
She who giveth,
can taketh away!

140
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:45,208
What are you doin' here?

141
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,458
I just got done
snacking over at Pal Crepe.

142
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:48,916
Next time,
you oughta come with!

143
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,041
Yum yum!

144
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:51,875
We're nowhere near
Pal Crepe right now.

145
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:54,416
Right, it's pretty far
come to think of it,

146
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,166
but when I saw you walking by,
I thought I'd surprise you

147
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,958
and follow your every footstep!

148
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:01,083
Of course.

149
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:02,458
Don't tell me
you're upset with me.

150
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:03,500
Wait, are you?

151
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:04,666
Do I really
embarrass you that much?

152
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,375
Oh please don't
start yelling obscenities!

153
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:09,750
Nah, there's more important
stuff goin' on tonight.

154
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:10,708
Is that so?

155
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:12,291
What kind of important stuff?

156
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:13,166
None of your business.

157
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,666
Let's go.

158
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,208
Hey, wait a minute!

159
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:19,291
Why're you so
forceful all of a sudden?

160
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:21,708
No questions, look,
just don't let go of my hand

161
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:24,416
till I say so, got it?

162
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,583
Hayato, is everything ok?

163
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,541
You're acting
a little different.

164
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:31,916
From now on
I'm gonna be protectin' ya.

165
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,583
Whoopee!

166
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:38,208
Atta girl, that's it.

167
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,000
Mew?

168
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:43,666
Head straight home.

169
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:47,541
And don't come back to
Yanagihara for a little while,

170
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:50,000
I'll let you know
when it's ok, ya' got it?

171
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:54,125
The streets have become a bit
more dangerous than usual.

172
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:57,041
Some crazy bastard's been
runnin' around town with a gun.

173
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,541
Our bicycle hunt's gonna
have to be shelved for now,

174
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:05,750
just wait at home until
I can figure everything out.

175
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:07,041
Yes sir!

176
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:09,208
Don't worry about
anything coming between us,

177
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:12,166
for absence makes
the heart grow fonder!

178
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:14,625
Well, she looked
like she was listening.

179
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:15,875
Least I hope.

180
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:22,583
 Why hello, Hayato!

181
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:24,375
What brings you
to this classy joint?

182
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:28,125
Lemme guess, you're an
angry thug lookin' to score!

183
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:29,166
Ooh, it's so hot in here!

184
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,458
I'm so wet and sticky!

185
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:32,708
I see you peeking!

186
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:35,208
How 'bout we go back to
your place for some fun-

187
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:36,833
Stop while you're ahead, wench,
or you'll end up

188
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:39,083
embarrassin' the both
of us; you got any idea

189
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:40,666
where Otori
might be hangin' out?

190
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,625
Um, you mean Kakeru?

191
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,708
I've heard that he's
always chillin' at this place.

192
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:46,083
I'd like to see him.

193
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:48,291
Well, yeah, he's definitely
here, but if I were you,

194
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:49,375
I wouldn't-

195
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:51,583
Wouldn't what?

196
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:53,208
Eh, never mind about that.

197
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:54,708
Come with me!

198
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,250
Otori?

199
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:20,875
How ya doin' there, buddy?

200
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:22,791
Uh, are you drinkin'?

201
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:26,125
What the hell's all that stuff?

202
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:28,458
Yep, I'm drunk!

203
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:30,125
Drunk and sick!

204
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:33,583
Living in this world always
puts me in a drinkin' mood!

205
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:35,541
Earth to Chicken,
come in, Chicken!

206
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:39,583
Cock-a-doodle-doo, and all of
that other damn chicken stuff.

207
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:42,500
Knock it off, Shu.

208
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:46,250
Oh, it's you, Hayato.

209
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:48,791
Make up your mind already;
surely, it takes more than

210
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,791
one drink to make you change.

211
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:53,958
I thought some people
didn't even need alcohol

212
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:58,375
to transform into
someone else, am I right?

213
00:11:58,458 --> 00:11:59,958
Shut up.

214
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:03,458
Still, I can't say that I ever
expected Hayato to come here,

215
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:05,500
though I was kinda
hoping at some point

216
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:07,291
we'd cross paths again.

217
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:09,291
I'm a little embarrassed,
letting you see me

218
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:12,583
in this state, drunk
and 'under the weather'.

219
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:14,291
But what's done is done.

220
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:16,666
Allow me to reintroduce myself!

221
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:21,250
My name is Kakeru Otori, and I'm
a big boy, seventeen years old!

222
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:22,416
Whatever, weirdo.

223
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,375
Listen up, the only
reason I came here

224
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:25,708
is to give you a warning.

225
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:27,125
Oh?

226
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:28,208
Enlighten me.

227
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:29,875
The nut case you
fought with from R-Wing,

228
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,166
that Archbishop guy?

229
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,833
You're gonna have
to watch out for that dude.

230
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:35,791
He's on a rampage and goin'
after just about everybody.

231
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:37,166
How 'bout that?!

232
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:40,500
So he caused quite a ruckus
at Alexander, I take it.

233
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:42,291
How'd you hear about that?

234
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:44,125
I have my connections.

235
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:47,000
Then how about you start takin'
this a little more seriously.

236
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:49,458
That psycopath is
still out there, dammit.

237
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:53,416
How sad, I think you're
underestimating my abilities

238
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,333
to handle myself,
plus he'd have to deal with me

239
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:58,750
and my faithful Flame Birdes!

240
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:01,208
It's not you that I'm
actually worried about, look,

241
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:03,750
everyone around you
is also in danger.

242
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:04,875
How Tragic.

243
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:06,916
One of my buddies
was shot last night.

244
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,000
That's your reaction?

245
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:10,958
Let me spell it out
nice an' clear for ya.

246
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:13,166
Your family needs
to be protected.

247
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:16,375
And that includes Naru,
you hear me?!

248
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:17,458
Naru?

249
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:18,875
Naru.

250
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:19,958
That's right!

251
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:21,708
Used ta call her sister!

252
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:25,125
Yeah, she means
nothing to me nowadays.

253
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:26,291
You bastard!

254
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:36,916
Piece of shit.

255
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,333
You may change how you look,
but you're still dumbass Otori.

256
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:42,166
You're on your own, good luck.

257
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,500
What a disappointment,
I was hoping that you'd

258
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:47,250
eventually get in the mood
to have some real fun.

259
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:49,916
Shut up, this whole thing
was a waste of my time.

260
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,875
In the future, I'm not gonna
even give you a warning.

261
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,166
Sorry to bother you.

262
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:58,916
Hey, let's plan on
meeting again sometime soon.

263
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,291
'Cept next time, why don't we
talk about our relationship.

264
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:21,000
Your manuscript has
been received, thanks!

265
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:24,916
Now before I forget, that Tamaki
Hosokawa story I'm waiting on,

266
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,166
is that review coming
along nicely for you?

267
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,416
Yep, I'm almost
through with it!

268
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,791
Should be done by next week.

269
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:32,083
Regarding that, I got
a little curious and thought

270
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:34,375
I would do some "independent
research" of my own.

271
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:36,000
She has two books
out now, right?

272
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:39,625
"Smiling Inside"
and "88th Birthday."

273
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:42,541
I forget, which one
are you writing about again?

274
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:43,708
This one here.

275
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:46,750
Ah, I wasn't
expecting that; you read it?

276
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:47,541
Huh?

277
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:48,333
What do you mean by that?

278
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:49,625
Is there something wrong?

279
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:51,958
Well, I haven't quite
read it myself just yet,

280
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:54,041
but a colleague did mention
that the ending to this one

281
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:56,333
is pretty depressing,
at least more downbeat

282
00:14:56,416 --> 00:15:00,250
than "Smiling Inside." Thought
you might want to know.

283
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:02,750
Yeah, I 've heard rumors.

284
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:05,000
She probably tried to
set it completely apart

285
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:06,375
from her first work.

286
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:08,958
It's the same mistake a lot
of young authors make.

287
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,666
They have one big seller, and
after that the expectations

288
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,250
are just too high to handle.

289
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:15,916
They try to mature and evolve
so they won't get pigeonholed,

290
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,750
but in the end they're
left with a confused

291
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,333
and disappointed audience.

292
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:22,333
Sophomore efforts can
really make or break careers.

293
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:24,166
Unfortunate, don'cha think?

294
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:25,666
It sure is.

295
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,875
Yep, everyone involved gets
the short end of the stick.

296
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:30,333
The print company,
bookstores, customers,

297
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:32,708
not to mention
your humble editor.

298
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,375
Is what you said true?

299
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:39,125
That my book, you thought
it was interesting.

300
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:42,000
Those words made me very happy.

301
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:43,750
Sounds pretty
disheartening to me.

302
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,291
So you get it now?

303
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:47,708
If you were to write one of
your trademark glowing reviews

304
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:50,458
for that girl, the ones you're
so good at, then it's bound

305
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:52,416
to do wonders
for her book sales.

306
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,333
And that can only
be a good thing, right?

307
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:55,500
That's perfect!

308
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:58,750
Yet another fantastic, idea!

309
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:01,833
You're quite enthusiastic, too
bad you already bought a copy,

310
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:03,041
I could've just given you one!

311
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:04,583
Never mind that,
you're already paying me

312
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:06,125
to write a glowing review.

313
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:09,208
Plus, doesn't my buying the book
make money for your company?

314
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:11,500
Maybe, but it won't do
a bit of good for me!

315
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:13,541
We could sell a billion
copies and I still wouldn't

316
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:16,125
get a promotion or a raise
from the suits up top!

317
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:19,166
Yep, I'll be a mid-level
editor all my life!

318
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:23,166
Well, you just
keep up the good work!

319
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:29,625
Where am I?

320
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:31,541
What the-?

321
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:33,208
Nothing unusual on my end.

322
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:34,250
Take care!

323
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:48,500
Where's the damn sugar?!

324
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:50,166
Crap is bitter as hell.

325
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:02,583
Hey there, kid.

326
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:07,000
Um, hello, Mr. Narita, right?

327
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:08,000
Yeah.

328
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:09,791
It-it's been so long!

329
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:11,583
I guess it has.

330
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:14,583
But I'm curious, what
exactly are ya doin' here?

331
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:17,166
Just some shopping.

332
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,083
For now I think ya'd
be better off stickin' to

333
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:21,166
your local stores,
this area's gotten

334
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,083
kinda dangerous recently.

335
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:24,583
Trust me on this one.

336
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:27,125
I bought bread!

337
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:28,958
I saw a commercial
for this bakery,

338
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:30,625
and the food looked delicious.

339
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:33,500
Long story short, he wanted
to try some of it out

340
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:35,291
and sent me on a mission, so-

341
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:37,458
So ya ended up comin'
all the way out here?

342
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:40,500
But the line was long
and the bakery was so busy,

343
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:42,541
I didn't even get my
order till it got dark.

344
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:45,083
Why do ya even like bread?

345
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:48,333
You're Japanese, wench,
ya oughta be eatin' rice!

346
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:49,833
Oh, I'm sorry.

347
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:51,583
Don't worry 'bout it.

348
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:53,583
Next time just let me know, OK?

349
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:55,000
Then I can get it for ya.

350
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:56,541
Oh.

351
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:59,000
OK, well then, thank you so
very much for your kindness!

352
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:01,041
Now go straight home,
with no other stops.

353
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:01,833
Ya got it?

354
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:02,833
Yes.

355
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:07,500
Also, Mr. Narita?

356
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:08,958
What is it? Yeah?

357
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:10,958
Sometime, please stop by the
house and I'll cook dinner

358
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:12,041
for all of us!

359
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:13,833
My way of saying thank you!

360
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:15,000
Absolutely.

361
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:16,500
Guess I'll be seein' ya'.

362
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:29,916
There's gotta be some place
I haven't looked yet.

363
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,958
Meow!

364
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:34,583
Meow!

365
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:38,541
Cut it out!

366
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:39,750
Meow!

367
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:42,041
Meow meowww!

368
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:44,291
"Meow" my foot,
ya damn mental case!

369
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:46,041
Did anything I said
yesterday get through

370
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,000
that thick skull of yours?!

371
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:50,416
And what the hell's up with
this idiotic cat wench costume

372
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,875
you've been pesterin' me in?!

373
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:54,666
It's always breakin'
my concentration, damn it!

374
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,000
Nyo nyo nyo!

375
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:57,875
I did exactly as you asked!

376
00:18:57,958 --> 00:19:01,041
So strong, those words
that escaped your lips

377
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:02,875
on that fateful day.

378
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:05,375
My precious Naru,
I must apologize for

379
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:06,583
misleading you so,

380
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:10,416
for tonight I'm not
wearing my work clothes.

381
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,125
It's unfair for you to see
me in anything other than

382
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:15,583
my manly work attire.

383
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:19,375
Come tomorrow evening,
I will appear before you,

384
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:22,333
dressed in work clothes rich
with the scent of perspiration

385
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:23,625
you know and love.

386
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,083
Those were your words!

387
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:30,916
But yet again you
torment me with casual wear.

388
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:31,875
OK.

389
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:33,125
So!

390
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:34,458
Until you come around,
I'll flaunt my feminine,

391
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:37,791
feline charms to
"purr-fection"!

392
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:40,125
Come to think of it,
I've always been more

393
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:41,750
of a dog person.

394
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:43,458
So funny and diligent!

395
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:45,041
Uh, scuse me?

396
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:47,666
I'm so thankful you volunteered
to help me look for my bicycle,

397
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,666
and that even now
you're still searching.

398
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,458
You're going to
all those places tonight?

399
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:52,291
Huh?

400
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:53,625
Hold on a second!

401
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:55,208
I'm just plannin'
a grocery route!

402
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:57,333
Don't jump to
stupid conclusions.

403
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:59,458
There's no need to be
so modest with me!

404
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:01,583
I already know what
a sweet person you are,

405
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:04,500
not to mention that you're
a fan of the barely legal look!

406
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:06,750
I've known some crazy wenches,

407
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:09,000
but you've gotta be
the craziest wench I know!

408
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:17,416
I've finally
found you, Narita!

409
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,500
Oh, great.

410
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,208
If I remember correctly,
that gun doesn't have

411
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:23,541
any more ammo in it.

412
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:25,333
You're gonna regret
what you've done to me,

413
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:27,041
gonna regret it real soon!

414
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:30,458
I've been through hell
and back to get here!

415
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:33,375
You reap what you sow,
I suppose.

416
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:34,625
Chew on this!

417
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:40,791
Bastard!

418
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:44,833
This time you
won't be so lucky!

419
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:46,083
Cut it out!

420
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:47,500
That's it!

421
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:54,833
No one makes
a fool outta me!

422
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:56,666
Get mad!

423
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:57,916
Be quiet!

424
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,083
Everyone will face the
barrel of my vengeance!

425
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:01,083
You hear that?

426
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:01,791
Punish him!

427
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:02,916
No, I can't.

428
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:03,750
Damn it all!

429
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:04,750
You're gonna pay!

430
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:05,500
Mess him up!

431
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:06,625
He'll regret it!

432
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:07,500
Just shut up!

433
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:08,833
You ready to meet your maker?!

434
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:10,583
Show no mercy to your enemy!

435
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:11,458
Stop, stop, stop!

436
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:12,500
Anger!

437
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:13,166
Enough!

438
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:14,250
Punish him!

439
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:15,750
Shut up!

440
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:17,833
Ain't so tough when there's
a gun in your face, are ya?!

441
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:19,250
What are you waiting for?!

442
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:21,958
--Kill him!
--I told you to shut up!

443
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:33,708
Are you ready to change?

444
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:35,166
Let's do it!

445
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:37,708
Shit!

446
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:39,791
That the world may know peace,
that the world may know peace,

447
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:42,250
that the world may know peace,
that the world may know peace,

448
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:42,875
that the world may know peace,
that the world may know peace,

449
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:43,875
Hayato?

450
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:45,083
Um-

451
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:54,208
That the world may know peace,
that the world may know-

452
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:55,041
What the hell?

453
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:56,666
The YFB?

454
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:59,791
Guess Chicken cares about
his sister more than he lets on.

455
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:11,833
You look tired.

456
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:14,791
Let's get something to eat
or just go to the club, 'kay?

457
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,291
Go ahead and rest up a bit.

458
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:18,583
But first, why don't we
finally have that conversation

459
00:22:18,666 --> 00:22:21,541
about just the two of us?

460
00:22:21,625 --> 00:22:25,833
Hey man, don't go
dozing off just yet.

461
00:22:25,916 --> 00:22:27,958
Hayato?

462
00:22:28,041 --> 00:22:29,333
Hey there Phoenix.

463
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:31,583
It's been quite a while,
hasn't it?

464
00:22:31,666 --> 00:22:33,916
You still keeping
all your wits about you?

465
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
It can't be; you're not-

466
00:22:36,083 --> 00:22:37,625
Oh, but I am!

467
00:22:37,708 --> 00:22:39,541
You see before you
the rightful successor

468
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:41,791
to the legendary
throne of Gretagard:

469
00:22:41,875 --> 00:22:46,291
The one and only
Garuda Dark-Black.

470
00:24:23,375 --> 00:24:25,250
Can't say I saw
that curveball comin'!

471
00:24:25,333 --> 00:24:27,666
Someone's disappeared
from the world of Naraku!

472
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,041
Messed-up stuff!

473
00:24:29,125 --> 00:24:29,791
Crazy!

474
00:24:29,875 --> 00:24:31,250
Who was it though?

475
00:24:31,333 --> 00:24:33,583
Can't be good, going from
Naraku to that weird place!

476
00:24:33,666 --> 00:24:35,333
Things are simply topsy-turvy!

477
00:24:35,416 --> 00:24:37,250
Who am I kidding,
I don't get it either.
