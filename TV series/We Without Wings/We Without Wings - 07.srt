1
00:00:14,416 --> 00:00:16,666
A chill that almost coils.

2
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,583
An utter darkness,
black as pitch.

3
00:00:19,666 --> 00:00:23,958
For most, being thrown into
the pit of Naraku means doom.

4
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:27,208
Like so many sacrificial birds,
these poor souls

5
00:00:27,291 --> 00:00:30,916
are cast into the depths
to be erased from existence.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
They are the lucky ones.

7
00:00:34,916 --> 00:00:35,708
Guess what!

8
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:37,583
It's snuggle time with Santa!

9
00:00:37,666 --> 00:00:39,041
No boys allowed!

10
00:00:39,125 --> 00:00:41,791
It's the "Nothing-But-Girls
Christmas Party"!

11
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,250
Stop!

12
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:44,333
So...

13
00:00:44,416 --> 00:00:45,833
They said we need
to show more skin

14
00:00:45,916 --> 00:00:47,708
if we want it
to be interesting.

15
00:00:50,791 --> 00:00:52,083
Seriously?

16
00:00:52,166 --> 00:00:54,208
'Cause we're kinda half-naked
right now as it is.

17
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:56,750
"And no compromises"
That's what they said.

18
00:00:56,833 --> 00:00:58,166
Uh.

19
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:00,083
The only thing left to
show off would be our panties.

20
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:02,000
Don't you think
that would be a bit much?

21
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:03,125
Doesn't matter.

22
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:04,583
Hiyoko, you're up.

23
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:05,916
What do you mean I'm up?

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,125
The note was for
all three of us.

25
00:01:07,208 --> 00:01:08,708
I'm not a solo act, ya' know?

26
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:10,875
No, but you are the solo
'Service Provider'

27
00:01:10,958 --> 00:01:12,041
for this show.

28
00:01:12,125 --> 00:01:13,916
If someone's gonna
show panties, it's you!

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,125
Service provider?!

30
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:16,375
You mean fan service?!

31
00:01:16,458 --> 00:01:19,250
That's my specialty!

32
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:20,625
What makes me
so special, you ask?

33
00:01:20,708 --> 00:01:22,916
Because I love every single
delicious minute of it!

34
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
One glance at my lovely lips
and you won't even care

35
00:01:25,083 --> 00:01:26,666
what the story
is about anymore!

36
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:29,166
I'm dripping at the thought of
becoming the hot young star

37
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,666
in everyone's
naughty fantasies!

38
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:33,666
Someone want to
tell me who that is?

39
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,666
Excuse me; this is
a live broadcast.

40
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:36,833
We've got to stop this.

41
00:01:36,916 --> 00:01:37,833
Anyone got a rope?

42
00:01:37,916 --> 00:01:39,250
Why would you
want to do that?!

43
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:40,583
You need more fan service
and who better to provide

44
00:01:40,666 --> 00:01:42,416
that than the unwittingly
sexy young ingénue with

45
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,000
an insatiable
desire to please?!

46
00:01:44,083 --> 00:01:46,250
I've made men and women cry
with my classic bone structure

47
00:01:46,333 --> 00:01:47,875
and an ass
that just won't quit!

48
00:01:47,958 --> 00:01:48,875
Oh, that's it!

49
00:01:48,958 --> 00:01:49,916
You girls can't handle this!

50
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,500
You're way too
moral and well-bred!

51
00:01:51,583 --> 00:01:54,541
What you need is someone whose
blood pulses with debauchery!

52
00:01:54,625 --> 00:01:55,375
Come on!

53
00:01:55,458 --> 00:01:56,750
Let's show 'em some T and A!

54
00:01:58,916 --> 00:01:59,958
You idiot!

55
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:02,125
I was in the
middle of a speech!

56
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:08,458
But even in this hopeless pit,
the wind sometimes blows.

57
00:02:08,541 --> 00:02:11,458
And at long last, the gale
blows strong enough that

58
00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:14,458
I might once again
ascend into the light.

59
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:22,000
Greetings, good Falcon!

60
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:23,583
A strong wind is needed!

61
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:26,625
I bid you to call upon
a raging tempest of hatred!

62
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,791
Next call's for
the Service Provider.

63
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:36,583
Right hand on yellow.

64
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:41,041
But that's all
the way over there!

65
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:42,250
That ought to do it!

66
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:43,958
Just a little farther.

67
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:47,708
Now for the rest
of you old ladies,

68
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:50,875
put your left foot on breast.

69
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:52,041
What the-?!

70
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:53,708
Okay, I'm coming in.

71
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:55,708
Mine?!

72
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:58,791
Point your middle finger
towards West Virginia.

73
00:02:58,875 --> 00:02:59,625
Where's that?!

74
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:01,041
Right here.

75
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:04,208
They even marked it for you!

76
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:06,541
I'm still talking you Fool!

77
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:13,000
And who the hell are you?

78
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:15,125
My my, someone's testy.

79
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:18,125
I advise you not to forget who
you're addressing, Falcon.

80
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:20,708
I don't even know
your name jackass.

81
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:22,875
Since you are the
one who broke the seal

82
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:25,166
that was binding me
to Naraku-

83
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:28,416
Just this once, I shall
forgive your ignorance.

84
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,083
In the realm of Gretagard,
I am King!

85
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:33,500
Huh?

86
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:36,958
Once upon a time, I was
known to my people as Garuda,

87
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:41,000
but now to blend in with
this new generation-

88
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:44,333
I am Karura Itami!

89
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:45,416
Ah shit.

90
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,083
So what's that mean?

91
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:48,750
We got a new family member now?

92
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:50,541
Not exactly the best timing.

93
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:52,375
New member?

94
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:55,833
Your foolishness amuses me.

95
00:03:55,916 --> 00:03:59,208
I existed long before any
of you were conceptualized.

96
00:03:59,291 --> 00:03:59,791
What?

97
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:00,958
How?

98
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:03,666
You were the ones
who followed, uninvited.

99
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,625
Now, return to the pits
from which you came,

100
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:08,958
and return the
throne to your king!

101
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:20,083
Holy shit that was long!

102
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:22,791
Can we finally get an episode
title up here please?!

103
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,083
During the interminable period
I was sealed in Naraku,

104
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:03,041
Gretagard's lands
were trespassed upon

105
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:04,708
by the most curious of people.

106
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:08,041
There are giant rectangular
columns and fortresses of gold.

107
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:10,250
My lands have become
infused with cultures

108
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:11,708
and customs unknown to me.

109
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:13,625
My beloved country
now has a new name.

110
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:17,375
It is known as 'Japan.'

111
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:19,458
Detestable fools.

112
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:23,458
It won't be long until you
are sinking in a sea of decay.

113
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:24,208
Hey!

114
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:26,125
You listening, Phoenix?

115
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:28,833
Of course I am.

116
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:30,166
I like you, Garuda.

117
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,083
You always had
a way with words.

118
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:33,375
Then we agree.

119
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:34,750
Excellent.

120
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:37,208
Ya know, I'm actually
kinda' jealous of you.

121
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:39,291
No matter how hard I try
to forget what happened

122
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:42,291
way back when, I still
wake up crying sometimes.

123
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:45,291
I bet that it's so much
easier on the other side.

124
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:46,333
Other side?

125
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:47,625
It's wonderful.

126
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:48,916
A quiet world.

127
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,750
One where everything
is sealed up inside you

128
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:52,791
and no one can ever get in.

129
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:54,333
More than that...

130
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:57,416
His words are almost
impossible to comprehend.

131
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,708
Who would have thought my
former military leader

132
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:02,291
Phoenix Flare-Gold would
become so proficient

133
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:04,166
in the language of my enemy?

134
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,625
Amazing.

135
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:09,250
Hayato, Shu and I have
tried our hardest for so long.

136
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:10,500
And you know,
it's not that they're not

137
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:12,625
interesting enough
in their own way.

138
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:15,041
It's just that
you're special, Karura.

139
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:16,250
I am different.

140
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:18,833
A king is a man,
yet not a normal man.

141
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:21,166
I am a descendant of the gods
and therefore untouchable

142
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,458
to most commoners.

143
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:25,875
There ya go; that's what
I want, further insight

144
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:27,666
into your world and mind.

145
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:31,208
Having been in enemy lands for
so long, he no doubt yearns

146
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:34,208
for tales of the former
glory of Gretagard.

147
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:36,916
Understanding that full well,
I told him of our

148
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,916
nostalgic homeland, our
beloved people, and of course

149
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,250
the many hardships
we faced and overcame.

150
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:52,500
He was clearly
quite happy with this.

151
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:54,375
He threw out a laugh
that sounded more like

152
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:57,000
a basilisk about to give birth.

153
00:07:57,083 --> 00:08:00,958
Undaunted, I joined him with
a roaring laughter of my own.

154
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:08,791
You're a frikkin
rockstar, mi amigo!

155
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:15,166
This is your king's
glorious return.

156
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:16,791
Go rally the troops, Phoenix.

157
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:19,291
We do need a welcoming
committee don't we?

158
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:22,500
But first, is there any way
I can service you O king?

159
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:26,083
I am here only to be
hated and resented.

160
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:28,416
My want is to kill
all the vile enemies

161
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,916
who have violated this nation.

162
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,458
Yes, your grace.

163
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:33,750
Though if you act too blatantly
against the occupation army,

164
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:36,125
you risk being captured,
and I hear prison

165
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:37,750
can be a living hell.

166
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:39,666
That is a risk I will not take.

167
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,250
I am a resolute soul but
I cannot bear the darkness

168
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:45,500
of hell, bad orc breath or
being separated from friends.

169
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:46,208
 No no!

170
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:48,000
That won't do at all!

171
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:49,916
How about we start slow, then.

172
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,708
First we need
to change your appearance.

173
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:53,875
Right now you
appear only as Falcon.

174
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:55,125
You are an honored King!

175
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:57,833
I need you to draw
how you think of yourself.

176
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:00,375
Kazuma.

177
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:01,375
Get down here.

178
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:02,791
You won't believe
what's going on.

179
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:05,333
'Sup boss man?!

180
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:07,250
Alright.

181
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:08,250
Here's all
that stuff you wanted.

182
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:10,291
So, I got you a nurse's outfit.

183
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:11,541
I hope you're okay with that?

184
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:12,416
What?

185
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,000
Talkin' about your costume man!

186
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:17,375
Christmas is coming up and we're
having a costume party, right?

187
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:18,958
Don't freak out.

188
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:21,541
We also bought a bunch of other
stuff to get this party rockin'!

189
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:22,416
Wait!

190
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,916
You're not feelin' it, are you?

191
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,958
Oh!

192
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:26,458
I know what's going on!

193
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:28,833
You'd rather wear the bunny
suit and I don't blame you!

194
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:30,333
I'm sorry!

195
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:33,333
Merry Christmas!

196
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:35,750
That day, the city
of Yanagihara was

197
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:37,375
alive and bustling.

198
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:39,875
Not even in the old capital
city of Morgen was there ever

199
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:42,666
such a massive
gathering of citizens.

200
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,750
The group of mercenaries Phoenix
assembled for me--citizens

201
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:50,125
and officers alike--were
becoming quite restless.

202
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:54,625
Oh, God damn, say my my my
I got some shit you wanna try.

203
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:56,916
Just a lick off the top'll
make them buds go 'pop!'

204
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,958
And it's P-U-D
to the Ding--yeah,

205
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:00,166
it make you wanna sing!

206
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,291
Yo, Vanilla is
a glorious thing Open wide,

207
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:04,166
shove it in and
kick the heroin!

208
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,291
Hope I din't go too far!

209
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:07,333
Psh, you know how you are!

210
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,666
Unbelievable.

211
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,458
We are on the brink
of war and both civilians

212
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:15,958
and soldiers
are alarmingly lax.

213
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:17,375
Right, snowman?

214
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:19,958
Hey!

215
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:21,375
I asked you
a question, damn it!

216
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:22,791
Are you listening?!

217
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,333
That man ain't real, man.

218
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:28,916
Release me, you insolent curs!

219
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,625
You will do as I command you!

220
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:33,791
Freeze these blemishes off me
with your Blizzard Breath!

221
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:36,208
What are you waiting for?!

222
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:37,500
I gave you orders!

223
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:38,458
Do you have brain freeze?!

224
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:39,375
Damn!

225
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:40,666
Are you high as shit or what?!

226
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,250
That snowman ain't real, bro.

227
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:44,333
I knew you must be
trippin' out or somethin'!

228
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:46,291
You can't speak
to him like that.

229
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:47,375
I told you.

230
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:49,916
That is Karura Itami.

231
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,750
He is your leader
and should be respected.

232
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:54,833
Uh, right.

233
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:55,958
I don't know what you're on;

234
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:58,333
but that's just
Narita in a freaky wig.

235
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:00,791
Speaking of freaky wigs,
don't you gotta get changed?

236
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:02,958
Better hurry it up, Boss.

237
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:03,958
Yeah!

238
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:06,458
You're gonna look
just like Naru!

239
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:07,500
'The hell?

240
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:10,750
It's Uni Kakizaki.

241
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:11,791
I see that.

242
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:13,500
Guess you really
like her a lot, huh?

243
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:17,791
So, I was wondering if you would
mind trying this on for me?

244
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:19,083
Man, this sucks!

245
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:21,083
Every other dude out here
has a girl with him!

246
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:22,625
There're couples everywhere!

247
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:24,291
Why am I sitting around
like a queer with a bunch

248
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:25,416
of broke-ass punks?

249
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,500
Whoa!

250
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:27,833
I swear it's like you
just hatched.

251
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:29,250
Let me give you
some tips about life.

252
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:30,125
What?

253
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:31,291
If you're here without a chick,

254
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:32,291
all it says is that
you don't need one.

255
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:33,000
And guess what?

256
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:34,333
Girls think that's hot!

257
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:36,000
But hey, who am I
to stop you if you wanna

258
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:38,083
bring a hot flesh box
for us to share!

259
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:39,250
Hey!

260
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:40,666
'Flesh box', huh?

261
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:44,791
Interesting.

262
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:46,583
Now look what you did!

263
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:47,666
I summoned her!

264
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,458
Quit doing that
air guitar shit, bro!

265
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:50,833
You're freaking people out!

266
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:52,208
No girl wants to hang around
with a bunch of weirdos!

267
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:53,750
Did you swallow a can
of "Ass-wipe" this morning?!

268
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:56,833
'Cause everything coming out
of your mouth right now stinks!

269
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:59,041
I say, you gotta keep it calm,
when you wanna get it on.

270
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:01,541
A virgin tryin too hard
won't ever lose the card.

271
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:02,708
Stick with me, Cherry Bros.

272
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:03,958
I know how to get the hos!

273
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:05,083
Had a hundred on my dong.

274
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:06,500
I ain't gonna steer you wrong!

275
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:07,125
Whoa!

276
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:08,125
A hundred?!

277
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:09,083
Damn!

278
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:11,250
LR is the man, yo!

279
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:12,625
Let me lead you in
the chase and you'll have

280
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:13,958
some skills for life.

281
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:16,375
You could even bang
the president's wife!

282
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:19,208
What do you mean by "bang?"

283
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:21,125
You speak of things
like "chasing" and "banging"

284
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,500
and "getting it on."
I'm quite fascinated.

285
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:24,500
I must know more.

286
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:26,000
Explain.

287
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:27,541
A'ight, but.

288
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:28,875
Relax.

289
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:31,375
You can't be all formal
talking 'bout this stuff.

290
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:35,208
Son of a bitch.

291
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:37,083
The boss really got me good.

292
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:38,958
If he wanted to wear a
maid's costume instead

293
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:40,291
he should've just said that.

294
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:42,291
He gets embarrassed
way too easy.

295
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:43,166
Huh?

296
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:44,625
'Sup, Narita?

297
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:45,708
Studying hard?

298
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:47,583
You look pretty
intense with that book.

299
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:49,250
I wish to ejaculate.

300
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:54,250
In the name of Naraku,

301
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:57,000
I wish to partake in
bountiful ejaculation!

302
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:59,583
Being a virgin king is
degrading to this country!

303
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:01,541
Therefore, I shall
have intercourse!

304
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:03,416
Oh, Jesus, I wish
he would cut it out

305
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,708
with the sick humor already,
it's a little embarrassing.

306
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:06,791
There's not much time.

307
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:08,500
Which one of you
is going to teach me?!

308
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:10,583
You might want to ask one
of the girls around here

309
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:12,250
to teach you
how to do that stuff.

310
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,416
Seriously, the tramps
in this town are always

311
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,625
ready to go at it.

312
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:16,875
You could take them
in their sleep!

313
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:17,583
Really?

314
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:19,041
Is that true?

315
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:20,875
So every one of them out
there will do the things

316
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:21,833
I see in this book to me.

317
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:22,875
Don't I know you?

318
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:24,666
Aren't you the
one they call Drac?

319
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:25,250
Hey!

320
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:26,791
I thought so!

321
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:28,916
Almost didn't recognize you
with that foxy silver wig on.

322
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,791
Looks good!

323
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,791
What perfect timing we have.

324
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:33,750
This is my lovely girlfriend.

325
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:34,875
She's number seventy-one--

326
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:36,291
Do you have
intercourse with her?

327
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:37,208
What?

328
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:38,583
That means you ejaculate!

329
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:40,583
I've not given you
that privilege!

330
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,333
Our king has made
his will quite clear.

331
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:51,708
What will you fools
do about it?

332
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:53,166
What do we do?

333
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,291
 I don't know.

334
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:56,500
I know what I'm gonna do!

335
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:58,500
I'm gonna help him
throw some cake!

336
00:13:58,583 --> 00:13:59,666
Eat this!

337
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:03,916
It looks like
we've broken through!

338
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,750
Show me your hands
if you're ready to fight!

339
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:07,083
Yeah!

340
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:13,458
This is better than heroin!

341
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:16,583
This one's for you!

342
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:20,666
Hey.

343
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,583
Looks like we have a surprise
guest at this party.

344
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:27,000
You called me out here so
that I might walk into this?

345
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:29,875
Shall I take this as a
declaration of war, Gentlemen?

346
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:31,166
He started it.

347
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:32,083
What are you doing?!

348
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:33,375
Have you two met?

349
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:35,333
This is my friend
Garuda Dark-Black.

350
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,916
He's- He's the
king of Gretagard.

351
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,291
I've heard the name.

352
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:42,041
So, what's with the
flying fucking cake?

353
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:43,500
Aren't you too old for games?

354
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:44,125
Ha!

355
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:45,666
Please.

356
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,541
Lighten up, man, when the hell
did we ever stop being kids!

357
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:50,125
Join the fun--bust out
that old rock song of yours.

358
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:51,500
Let's hear the old Crow!

359
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:52,666
'Member when you shoved
me down just to roll around

360
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,166
in a fit of laughter?

361
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:55,833
Covered in mud, but we laughed
just 'cause the adventure

362
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:57,166
was worth all the pain...

363
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:58,416
I know those words.

364
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,000
Hell yeah!

365
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:01,166
It's a song Kurodo wrote when
he was in the band, Rock Bird--

366
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,500
"A World 140 Centimeters Tall"!

367
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:05,500
Penis! Penis! Penis! Penis!
What's it all about, now?

368
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:06,958
Penis! Penis!
What makes you a man?

369
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:08,625
Penis! Penis!
Everyone wants that penis!

370
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:10,083
Penis!
What puts you on top?

371
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:11,666
Penis! Penis!
Never ever gonna stop!

372
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,958
Penis! Penis! Penis! Penis!
Penis! Penis! Penis! Penis!

373
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:30,916
I think I may have to get
my eyes checked again.

374
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,375
It looks like
Kakeru and Shusuke

375
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:33,875
are having a cake fight.

376
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,875
Hey, Takashi?

377
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:42,916
What's the matter?

378
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,916
Um, was that, no.

379
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:50,583
Oh now, why the long face,
Your Majesty?

380
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:52,625
I guess you finally
resigned to your fate?

381
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:53,333
Huh.

382
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:54,875
No, nothing of the sort.

383
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:58,708
I believe that I spotted
Princess Dove just now.

384
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,041
My Lovely Princess Dove.

385
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:03,250
Remnant of a former age.

386
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:05,333
I am here to protect you.

387
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:09,625
That must become the mission
I put above all else.

388
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:10,916
The war has ended!

389
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,041
We shall resume
at a later time!

390
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:14,333
My mission awaits.

391
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:16,541
I must hurry and
return to the castle!

392
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:18,000
Huzzah!

393
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:20,291
We shall continue
after a short break!

394
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:32,125
Well, well, what a day, huh?

395
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:35,583
But it helped me uncover
a memory I'd forgotten long ago.

396
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:37,458
Just a simple memory
of playing in the park

397
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:39,458
with my friend
and little sister.

398
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:40,583
Lovely.

399
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:41,666
Then I shall make
the most of the time

400
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,333
I get to play with Dove.

401
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:44,166
Sounds good.

402
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,958
Let's do it again soon.

403
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:47,000
Indeed.

404
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:49,250
If tomorrow
we are still at peace.

405
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:52,083
Who's there?!

406
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:53,583
Come out at once!

407
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:55,666
Your king has returned!

408
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,625
Someone come out
and welcome me!

409
00:16:57,708 --> 00:16:58,416
Um.

410
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,708
Welcome home.

411
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:02,750
It's been so long, Princess!

412
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:05,166
My, don't you look lovely!

413
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,541
Thanks but, do I know you?

414
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:08,625
What?

415
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:11,166
Are you saying
you do not recognize me?

416
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,708
I suppose it's natural.

417
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:14,708
Come to think of it,
the last time I saw you,

418
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:16,833
you were barely
eating solid foods.

419
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:18,291
I watched you
fumble with a pepper.

420
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:22,166
Oh, um, you're Mr. Itami;
I remember you.

421
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,250
Yes, that's correct.

422
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,083
I am so honored
that you remember me!

423
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:27,708
Well, it has been a long time.

424
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:30,083
Um, please come in
and make yourself at home.

425
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:31,583
Help yourself
to whatever you'd like.

426
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:33,166
Thank you.

427
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:34,250
Hold on...

428
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:35,500
Could you please
take off your shoes?!

429
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:37,833
My apologies,
of course I can.

430
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:40,375
I'll remove my clothes, too.

431
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:41,083
No, don't!

432
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:42,375
Your clothes are fine!

433
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:44,750
Is that so?

434
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:45,916
It's a pity.

435
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,958
I wanted to show you
proof of my loyalty.

436
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:49,583
It troubles me
that the holy lance

437
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:52,166
is in a sad and lonely
condition today.

438
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:55,083
My wish is to experience
a quick ejaculation.

439
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:56,375
I tried, Phoenix!

440
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:59,958
Will I still
be called a "virgin"?

441
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:00,750
Oh.

442
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:02,166
My princess, what's wrong?

443
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,541
Oh no, nothing at all!

444
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,541
Please don't worry about it.

445
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:08,916
Um, I was just a little
surprised to see you,

446
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
but it has nothing to do
with your visit Mr. Itami.

447
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:12,458
I'm sorry.

448
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:14,875
She waved both hands
frantically in negotiation

449
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:16,250
as though she was flustered.

450
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:18,125
But it was then I was
reminded of what a caring

451
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:20,041
and modest young girl she is.

452
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:23,166
She was only showing
concern for my feelings.

453
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:26,333
With my gaze fixed on
her firm smile, I felt it.

454
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:29,541
A warm sensation
began to wash over me.

455
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:31,500
Could this be the feeling
they are referring to

456
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:34,333
when describing the
emotion called "love?"

457
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:39,708
I would like to marry you
and have the intercourse.

458
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:45,500
May I take it that
your inability to respond

459
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:48,333
is a sign of approval?

460
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:49,708
Tell me, Princess.

461
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:51,875
How would it be possible
to leave behind descendants

462
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:53,875
if the king
always remains a virgin?

463
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:57,125
Oh, I'm sorry, I don't know
anything about that stuff!

464
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:58,041
I'm a good girl!

465
00:18:58,125 --> 00:18:58,916
Is that so?

466
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,250
I knew of your heart and mind,

467
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:03,541
but if you say you
are truly a 'good' girl then.

468
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:05,833
Let's see.

469
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:07,583
Thus far, I quite agree.

470
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:09,291
These have grown splendidly.

471
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:12,708
Undoubtedly perfect
for breastfeeding.

472
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:13,416
Princess?!

473
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,500
Hey, what's the matter?!

474
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:15,333
Are you in pain?!

475
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:16,708
Why are you shaking?!

476
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:19,708
A firm pulmonary massage
should calm your breathing.

477
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:20,541
Hold still!

478
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:22,750
Please, I'm trying to help!

479
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:24,791
Princess!

480
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:29,041
Look, you can't just
grab a girl's body

481
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:30,666
without permission like that!

482
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,625
And the next time you decide
to stay out all night,

483
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:35,083
I'd appreciate a phone call
so I don't worry!

484
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:36,416
Hmm.

485
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,458
Please understand, Princess.

486
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:41,500
It was the warrior, Falcon who
shirked that responsibility.

487
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:42,500
That doesn't matter.

488
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:43,750
But since you all
live together,

489
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:45,583
maybe you should start
discussing these things.

490
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:47,166
They probably wouldn't
like that you're here

491
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,000
trying to get me to marry you.

492
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:50,875
You have no need
to worry, Dove.

493
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:53,041
Now that I have reclaimed
my rightful throne,

494
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,541
I have absolutely no
intention of relinquishing

495
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:57,541
my position to anyone.

496
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:02,666
What's that mean?

497
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:05,833
It means this body has
finally become mine alone,

498
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:07,666
for all of eternity.

499
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:11,250
Those troublesome exchanges
shall never again reoccur.

500
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:12,041
Huh?

501
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:14,083
How come?

502
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:15,833
What'll happen
to the rest of them?

503
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:17,958
You mean my unsavory
younger brothers?

504
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:20,625
All that I know is that
they shall never surface again.

505
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:25,333
So, then, what
about my brother?

506
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:26,708
And who do you mean?

507
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:29,291
Hawk Cyan-Blue,
Takashi Haneda?

508
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:31,541
He is, of course,
no exception.

509
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:33,791
That's not who I mean,
I don't care about him!

510
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:36,166
I want my real brother!

511
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,208
Not Takashi!

512
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:38,375
Not Chitose!

513
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:39,541
And not Narita!

514
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:40,375
They don't matter!

515
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:41,666
I just want my real brother!

516
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,375
The one who was here first!

517
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:46,583
I don't care what happens to the
other ones who came after him!

518
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:48,000
Oh?

519
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:50,916
What 'other ones?' Tell me!

520
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:59,083
Um, I was-I was just joking.

521
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:02,375
I'm sorry for startling you.

522
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:04,166
I mean, I know.

523
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:07,375
My brother is only isolating
himself from himself.

524
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:11,208
I don't blame anyone, and
it's not your fault either.

525
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:13,541
Princess.

526
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:15,875
My poor Princess Dove.

527
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:18,208
Her brother left
when she was very young,

528
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:22,791
and even though they can never
reunite, she will not give up.

529
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:24,958
My priest always said
if I'm a good girl,

530
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:29,708
good things will happen to me,
and I've tried very hard, but-

531
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:32,208
I'm still here, waiting for him,
and the fact that my brother

532
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,416
won't come out must mean
I can't be good enough

533
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,083
no matter how hard I try.

534
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:41,458
My only thought at that moment
was, "I wish I could help her."

535
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:43,666
Could it be that although
I have only ever thought of

536
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:46,750
dispatching the others,
I must instead strive

537
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:51,625
to preserve their lives
in order to see her happy?

538
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:54,208
Those tears pierce my soul.

539
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:56,166
I must try to help.

540
00:21:58,583 --> 00:21:59,750
Oh no!

541
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:00,958
I think I left the water
running in the bath tub!

542
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:02,250
I'm just gonna go check.

543
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:04,041
I'll be right back, kay?

544
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:08,583
I knew the best thing
for me to do was leave.

545
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:14,791
Sweet Kobato,
I wish we had more time.

546
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:17,083
I would like to fulfill
your modest request,

547
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:20,583
even if it requires me
to make an exchange.

548
00:22:20,666 --> 00:22:25,208
After all, I, no, we were
born into this world

549
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:27,916
so she would never
have to know sadness.

550
00:22:29,458 --> 00:22:34,791
And so once more I will plummet
into the depths of Hell.

551
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:35,958
I'm sorry.

552
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:38,208
Again, I 've failed.

553
00:22:38,291 --> 00:22:40,625
I could not uphold
that promise, Phoenix.

554
00:22:44,625 --> 00:22:48,416
The promise that Kobato's
world may know peace.

555
00:24:23,125 --> 00:24:24,416
How's it hangin' people?!

556
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,791
This is DJ Condor's preview
and we are broadcasting

557
00:24:26,875 --> 00:24:28,375
from the depths of Naraku!

558
00:24:28,458 --> 00:24:29,458
Salutations!

559
00:24:29,541 --> 00:24:31,083
I have returned to Naraku.

560
00:24:31,166 --> 00:24:32,375
Who are you?!

561
00:24:32,458 --> 00:24:33,208
You can't barge into
the booth when we're live!

562
00:24:33,291 --> 00:24:33,833
I don't mind!

563
00:24:33,916 --> 00:24:35,083
Please continue.

564
00:24:35,166 --> 00:24:36,833
You don't mind, but I-
Ah! We're out of time!
