1
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:22,583
What the hell?

2
00:00:22,666 --> 00:00:24,125
It's still early
in the morning.

3
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:31,833
Well, well.

4
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:34,958
Looks like I'm Takashi today.

5
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:35,958
This sucks.

6
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:38,875
Morning.

7
00:00:48,958 --> 00:00:51,125
Uh. Sorry,
this is all we have.

8
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:53,833
Oh. Well. Thanks a lot.

9
00:00:58,833 --> 00:01:01,041
Besides, a growing guy's
gotta have his rice and meat,

10
00:01:01,125 --> 00:01:02,708
am I right?

11
00:01:02,791 --> 00:01:06,166
Yes, but it's also good to have
some veggies for nutrition.

12
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:08,041
Uh. Yuk.

13
00:01:10,125 --> 00:01:12,458
All right, I'm leaving.
I've got plans this evening,

14
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:15,750
so I'll be home a little late-

15
00:01:15,833 --> 00:01:17,416
Wait. You can't
just skip school,

16
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,333
people might get suspicious.

17
00:01:19,416 --> 00:01:21,458
Hey. I'm going
to school, relax.

18
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:23,583
But you have to wear
a uniform, so get back inside

19
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:26,000
and change or you'll
be in all sorts of trouble.

20
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:30,750
I know, ya wench,
I was just making sure

21
00:01:30,833 --> 00:01:33,208
you were paying attention.
Get off my back!

22
00:01:34,375 --> 00:01:37,125
Sorry. I completely forgot.

23
00:01:37,208 --> 00:01:38,500
Ya wench.

24
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,708
How high do these people have
to be to handle being out

25
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:18,791
in the sun this early?
Then again, I guess Takashi

26
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:21,583
does it every day, so maybe
I shouldn't complain.

27
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:27,083
Damn. All right! Hurry
up and set already,

28
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:28,875
will you sun?
Ya stupid bastard!

29
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,125
Takashi!

30
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:33,958
You're not really
Takashi, are you?

31
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:36,458
Uh. Whaddaya mean?
Of course I am.

32
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:38,416
I mean who else
would I be? It's me.

33
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,041
Oh, cut it out, will ya?

34
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:41,625
Your friend told me everything.

35
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:43,875
I know what's going on,
so there's no need to lie,

36
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:45,250
understand?

37
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:47,000
You can quit with the
nonsense and stop pretending

38
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:48,583
like you're somebody else.

39
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:50,958
Although. Truth is,
this whole thing makes me

40
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:52,375
wanna punch your face!

41
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:54,875
So. Stay away and
don't speak to me!

42
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,000
Man, this girl is gonna
turn out to be a handful.

43
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:04,291
I guess Kobato's
not the only one.

44
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:21,708
Come on. Can we please get this
whole process going, already?!

45
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:23,708
Nobody can go
anywhere till you do.

46
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:25,291
Wait, what are you
talkin' about?

47
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:26,833
You know!

48
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:29,375
Giving out the assignments for
the graduation essays moron!

49
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:31,208
You're such a waste of space.

50
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:35,000
Graduation essays, huh?

51
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:37,666
So, are you gonna give us
our assignments or what?

52
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,375
Yeah. Get with it, Takashi.

53
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:41,125
You don't wanna
sit here all day, do you?

54
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:42,666
I mean, what are you, a nerd?!

55
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:46,041
What in the hell's so funny?!

56
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:56,125
Now. Crater face,
you do collections.

57
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:58,416
And you there,
douche in the second row.

58
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,625
You're gonna be
in charge of the assembly.

59
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:03,416
You do the photos. And
you're gonna do the layout.

60
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,125
Got it? Each manager,
round up a few people

61
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:08,083
and get to work, dismissed.

62
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:10,000
This sucks. Why is
Takashi acting like such

63
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:11,416
a jerk face?

64
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,125
Who does he think he is?!
Well! I'm not doing squat!

65
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:15,958
All right. Now that's enough.

66
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:19,416
Stop complaining or
I'll kill all o' ya'!

67
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,958
I was asked to make a
decision here and I made one.

68
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:23,500
Do you got
a problem with that?!

69
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:26,125
No. But you could've
been nicer about it.

70
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:29,250
Hey. Is it just me or does
he seem a bit different today?

71
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:32,125
Yeah. You're right;
he's totally freaking me out.

72
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:35,333
Since he's acting like such
a psycho, let's ask Masako.

73
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:41,083
Oh. Uh. Not Bad.

74
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:43,708
Huh?!

75
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:45,375
I'll punch you!

76
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,541
Finally. I hate school.

77
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:51,250
Hey, whatever the hell
your name is.

78
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:54,250
It's you again. Didn't your
parents teach you anything?

79
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:56,916
It's not polite for a proper
young lady to talk like that.

80
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,125
Well you can just
shut your stupid face.

81
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:00,541
And will you please
stop doing all this

82
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:03,166
super weird stuff
in Takashi's body?

83
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,833
I don't want him suffering the
consequences of your stupidity,

84
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:06,916
you understand?

85
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,083
All right.

86
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:09,166
Jeez, did you forget
we're not speaking?

87
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,875
No, you can't talk to me!

88
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:12,708
Do a better job
of acting like Takashi

89
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:14,958
and not the big jerk you are.

90
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:20,791
Who in the hell
does she think she is?

91
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:22,958
That wench needs
an attitude adjustment!

92
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:26,000
I swear, I could
spot you anywhere, man.

93
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:27,875
I know that's
you in there, Falcon.

94
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:30,875
Hey! Where'd you come from?
My ears are sensitive.

95
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:33,458
I don't appreciate you
breathing on them, ya' jerk!

96
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:35,958
Garuda, Eagle, then Hawk.

97
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:37,791
And now the Falcon.

98
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:41,583
How many more are lurking down
there inside that endless abyss?

99
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:43,583
Are you done?
You're really boring me.

100
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:46,250
No, I'm afraid I'm not
done yet. Messing with you

101
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:47,500
is so much fun.

102
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:50,041
As a matter of fact,
I've barely started.

103
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:51,958
But for the time being,
I think I'll just keep

104
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:53,625
a close eye on you.

105
00:06:55,333 --> 00:07:01,041
Oh yeah. Nice uniform, Falcon.
I think it suits you. Later.

106
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:05,541
Guess I should get going.

107
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:08,125
She's never very understanding
when I'm runnin' late.

108
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:12,166
It's hard, not being able
to tell anyone, isn't it?

109
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,875
You want someone to listen,
just to make it

110
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:16,416
a little bit easier on you,
but, you're also terrified

111
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,083
of being an outcast.

112
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:19,958
You're afraid of what would
happen if people found out

113
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:22,000
the truth so you
keep it bottled up.

114
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:25,375
And you carry that burden around
with you every single day.

115
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:28,250
And every moment that passes,
the pain gets worse and worse

116
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:30,875
till you can't
take it any longer.

117
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:32,125
But still.

118
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:33,666
Even though it may feel
like it you should know

119
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,875
that you're not alone,
I have something I can't

120
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:37,416
tell other people, too.

121
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,041
So what? Now we
tell each other?

122
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:43,541
Only if you want to.
Either way is fine.

123
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:47,875
The truth is, that day, when you
spoke to me, you made me feel

124
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:50,041
like I was normal for the
first time in my life and

125
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:55,458
I just wanna return the favor.
And I wanted to say thank you

126
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:02,416
You heard her, Takashi.

127
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,458
Oh yeah. I meant to ask,

128
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:07,625
how do you feel about multiple
personality disorder?

129
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:09,541
You just wanna
pry it out, don't you?!

130
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:13,833
Ah. That's more like it,

131
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:16,541
sure is nice to be
back in my own skin.

132
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:17,833
Guess who?!

133
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:21,750
Hey, let go! Stop!
You're clawing my eyes out!

134
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:23,291
Umm. The correct response is,

135
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:26,041
oh my eyes are so overwhelmed
with your love I can't see!"

136
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:29,250
Or something like, 'aren't
you a sight for sore eyes?'

137
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:30,583
Love!

138
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:33,708
Oh my God. You wenches
have lost your damn minds.

139
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,666
I was just trying to
describe what it feels like

140
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:38,916
the first time you
fall in love. Right?

141
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,041
We're not in love,
or anything of the sort.

142
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:42,500
And what are you
doing here, Ai?

143
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:46,125
Naru's been acting
suspicious all day long.

144
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:48,333
She wouldn't talk
so I tickled it out of her!

145
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:51,291
Man, I really can't get over how
hell-bent this little vixen

146
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:53,666
in kitten's clothing was to
sneak over here and see you!

147
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,250
Gosh. You're totally the
worst third-wheel ever!

148
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:59,125
That's right. You two go to
the same school, don't you?

149
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:00,750
Not getting along very well?

150
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:03,583
It's nothing like that.
She's like my best friend!

151
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:04,666
Heck yeah!

152
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,791
I see. Congratulations.

153
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:08,041
Thanks!

154
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:10,541
Anyway. Did you happen
to ride your bike here?

155
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:14,041
Yeah. I sure did! My bicycle
symbolizes the fruits

156
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:16,708
of our undying love for each
other. I rode it cause I wanna

157
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:19,208
make sure that everybody has
a chance to lay eyes on it.

158
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:20,791
I invited the
Crepe Lady and Alice-

159
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:23,166
Looks like the fruits of your
love are being taken away.

160
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:30,583
No, you can't! I just
now got it back! Wait!

161
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:35,333
Hayato!

162
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:37,125
Yeah, yeah. Whataya want.

163
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:40,041
Ta-da! I wore this cause
I know you have a fetish

164
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:42,833
for school girls
in swimsuits, see?

165
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,750
I wish you would learn
to keep it down wench,

166
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:47,833
that's just the kinda thing that
can ruin a guy's reputation.

167
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:50,625
Come on... Don't you like
the way it looks on me?

168
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:53,416
Seriously. People are going to
start thinking I'm some sort of

169
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,625
freak show pervert guy
if you keep this up.

170
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:58,083
And why the hell did you bring
me to a fancy joint like this?

171
00:09:58,166 --> 00:09:59,541
I stick out like a sore thumb!

172
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:02,208
One of my father's business
partners owns this place.

173
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:04,041
I thought that after
everything you've done for me,

174
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:06,041
it might be nice for you
to wash off all that sweat,

175
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:07,458
kick back, and relax.

176
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:09,666
If I wanted to relax
I'd go to the hot springs.

177
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:10,958
Thank you for waiting.

178
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:12,875
Alice. You're just a kid,

179
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:16,666
it shouldn't take you that
long to-What are those?!

180
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,333
You may not know this Drac.

181
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:21,333
Girls grow up to be adults
quickers than boys can.

182
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:23,625
These are my loving muffins.

183
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:25,541
You already fall
under their spell.

184
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,083
Now you love me for always.

185
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:29,541
That's the worst
stuff job I've ever seen.

186
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:33,250
Ah! I found you!
I don't believe this!

187
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:35,333
You can't just walk away
with my bra padding!

188
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:38,708
These things are not toys! These
pads are my secret weapons!

189
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:46,208
This is the
worst day of my life!

190
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:49,833
Slow down! And don't
run by the pool!

191
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:57,500
What in the heck
is wrong with her?

192
00:10:57,583 --> 00:10:59,083
I have no idea.

193
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:03,125
Who needs those stupid
pads? I'm havin' fun!

194
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:07,333
Me too, but maybe ya'
shouldn't give 'em up just yet!

195
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:11,125
I am sexiest lady in the
water by the long shots!

196
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,583
Don't be such a perv,
Drac, stop leering.

197
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:34,375
Please, get over yourself.

198
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:37,333
Like I'm actually so desperate
I need to sneak a peek at you.

199
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:40,166
You know what? If I'm being
completely honest with you,

200
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,458
I didn't think you'd stick
it out with her 'til the end.

201
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:44,708
Really? Then why the hell
did you push her on me?

202
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:47,541
Ha! It's because
you're so capricious.

203
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:50,625
But you liked it. It was
kinda nice, wasn't it?

204
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:52,916
Oh, shut up already, will ya?

205
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:57,750
Help me, Drac!

206
00:11:57,833 --> 00:12:00,041
I'm drowning in
a pool of your sweet love.

207
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:01,083
Idiot.

208
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:03,000
Jump in here and rescue me!

209
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:07,041
Well. I'm running a bit behind,

210
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:09,541
so I'd better toss her
in a cab and get to work.

211
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:12,000
It's early,
I no want go home.

212
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:14,916
Let us party like Marty
and dance the night gone.

213
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,875
Yeah, yeah.
Thanks for today, Drac.

214
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:20,500
I haven't been swimming in
forever, it was a lotta fun.

215
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:23,791
Bye, bye!

216
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:25,875
Alice sure
did look sleepy, huh?

217
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:27,541
Uh huh. That's
what happens when

218
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:30,791
you spend all day
playing in the pool.

219
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,041
Well. I should take off.

220
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:35,125
Where exactly do you
think you're off to, mister?

221
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:37,333
Come with us,
the night's still young!

222
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:51,958
Sorry to keep you waiting.

223
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:53,750
But this cake's
totally worth it!

224
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:56,208
I swear, this place
has the best cake in town!

225
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:59,375
I know, right?!
It's so delicious!

226
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:01,666
What about you sir,
you ready to order?

227
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:06,625
If there's anything I can help
you out with, let me know.

228
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:07,625
What's wrong?

229
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:09,000
You don't know
what you want yet?

230
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:11,833
Yeah. Come on, Hayato,
just make up your mind!

231
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,416
Will you please shut up?!

232
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,166
I'd appreciate it if you didn't
say my name so loud, ya wench!

233
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:19,500
Yep. It's another
beautiful night tonight.

234
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:21,416
Oops, I dropped something.
Be right back.

235
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,041
Only one thing could make
this moment more perfect.

236
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:25,958
If I had my arms
wrapped around a sexy,

237
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:29,833
naked lady who wanted
to make sweet love.

238
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:32,416
Damn. Out of all the restaurants
we could've gone to,

239
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,500
you had to pick
this one, ya wenches!

240
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:36,250
Hey, Hayato,
is everything all right?

241
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:37,500
Do you need some help?

242
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:39,125
Oh no, I'm okay!

243
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:43,250
All right. You can
take it from here, buddy!

244
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:48,916
Not cool Hayato!
Not cool at all!

245
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,125
What are you doing down there?

246
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:52,500
Uh. Nothing. I found
what I was looking for.

247
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,166
Hayato?

248
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:58,125
Of course. Who else would
I be, ya dumb wenches?!

249
00:13:58,208 --> 00:14:01,375
Well, that was
a bit uncalled for.

250
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:04,000
Hey. What magazine
are you reading?

251
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:06,500
Oh, it's 'Men's Freeze'. Look.
I thought you might like

252
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:09,208
to see this article. There's
a nice write-up on Kakeru.

253
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:11,833
I already read it.
I'm not impressed.

254
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:14,083
Then again, I've seen him
stick his hand down his pants

255
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:15,958
and scratch himself in public.

256
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:18,333
You're kidding me,
he actually does that?

257
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:20,416
That's all kinds of gross!

258
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,833
I've gotta drag
Hayato back out, ASAP.

259
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:25,083
Let's just hope
nobody spots me first.

260
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:27,708
--Stop right there!
--Damn it, she caught me!

261
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:30,208
Well, well, look at
what we have here.

262
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:32,458
Why are you dressed in
that ridiculous outfit, huh?

263
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:33,875
And why did you ignore me?

264
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:35,958
Well. You see, the thing is-

265
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,916
I get it. Yeah. It's 'cause you
were with a couple of girls.

266
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,958
You didn't wanna
make a big scene.

267
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:43,041
Yes, that's exactly right
Eriko, you hit the nail

268
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:44,625
right on top of
the head this time;

269
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:45,750
you're a certifiable genius!

270
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:47,791
Hey Boss. Shusuke
skipped out on work

271
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:50,166
and then had the nerve to
bring two girls up here!

272
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,083
Thanks for throwing me
under the bus!

273
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:53,958
Did you just say two?
Nice work.

274
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:55,375
When it comes to women,
I would've pegged you

275
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:58,291
for a sissy little herbivore.
But I guess I was wrong.

276
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:02,291
You big carnivore! Although
being dominated cow-girl style

277
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:03,458
isn't so bad either.

278
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:04,958
Aww man, this is
all your fault.

279
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:07,041
No way I'll get that image
out of my head now!

280
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:09,416
Don't you worry, Shusuke.
Whatever happens in

281
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,875
the circle of trust, stays
in the circle of trust.

282
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:14,666
Also. A three is an excellent
way to lose your virginity

283
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,416
in case you were still
trying to make that happen.

284
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,666
Hey! You're only supposed
to bleep curse-words!

285
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:21,375
And besides, our relationship
isn't like that anyway!

286
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:23,958
So Please do me a favor
and keep quiet about it!

287
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:27,333
Hey, Hiyoko!

288
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:29,541
Shusuke brought two girls with
him just to rub it in your face!

289
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:30,666
Why would you say that?

290
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,875
Well. Isn't that
a nice surprise?

291
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:35,166
Oh please, don't be mad.

292
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,291
Come on guys; don't leave
me hanging like this!

293
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:38,875
Uh, Listen. Hiyoko.

294
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:41,625
What if I told you those two
were just friends of the family?

295
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:43,458
It's really none
of my business.

296
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:45,583
As far as I'm concerned,
you can spend your days off

297
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:47,208
with whomever you like.

298
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:49,625
Wait. There's something
I'd like to ask you.

299
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:50,750
Spit it out, then.

300
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:52,583
No, never mind. Sir!

301
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:56,000
Cool. I didn't know you were a
fan of Tamaki Hosokawa's work?

302
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:57,458
Oh yeah.

303
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:59,375
I've read both of her books
and I think they're great!

304
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,500
I especially
liked 88th Birthday.

305
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:03,750
It's a completely different
style than her first book...

306
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:06,166
But for some reason,
it really resonated with me.

307
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,166
Interesting.
I'd have to say that

308
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,791
Smiling Inside is my favorite.

309
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:12,125
Every time I read it
my heart pounds like crazy.

310
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:14,791
This one's great too. You
should give it another read.

311
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:16,958
It takes a little bit of
patience, but once you get

312
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:19,333
wrapped up in the story, you
won't be able to put it down.

313
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:21,375
Ya' See, I told you
people would like it.

314
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:23,125
Wow. She's a fan?

315
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:24,708
Huh. I forgot.

316
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:27,041
I actually chucked this one the
first time I read through it.

317
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:28,250
Is it really that good?

318
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:30,958
Trust me, it's super
awesome! Wait. One sec.

319
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:34,166
I think there's a review of the
book in this month's issue.

320
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,833
See, look. They rave about it
in there; it's almost enough

321
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:38,583
to make me want to read
the whole thing again.

322
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:42,875
Oh yeah. You're right. That
sounds good. You know what?

323
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:44,083
I think I'll give
it another shot.

324
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:46,125
Great! I know you
won't be disappointed.

325
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:48,250
I'm sure! I like
what the magazine says!

326
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:50,166
Come on, I wouldn't
steer you wrong!

327
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,000
Hey, isn't that
your review, Shusuke?

328
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:54,208
Sure is, come with me.

329
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:57,833
Let's go say hello. It's time
for you to face your fans!

330
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:59,833
Guess what, you two?
There's a special someone

331
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:01,041
I'd like you to meet.

332
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:02,416
A special someone?

333
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,791
But she looks like
a waitress to me.

334
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:08,083
Oh, she's famous.
Big, Huge! She's Miss-I mean,

335
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:11,375
this wench right here is Tamaki
Hosokawa, your favorite writer!

336
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:15,166
Are you pulling my chain?!

337
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,375
No I wouldn't do that,
I'm serious!

338
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:20,166
And I brought her all the
way out here just for you!

339
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:23,333
Uh, hi there, nice to meet you.

340
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:28,291
Oh, wow. This is so
awesome. How cool!

341
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:29,958
I'm Smiling Inside right now!

342
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:31,375
I love you!

343
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:32,750
Oh yeah. Me too!

344
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:34,458
You're like the
greatest writer I know!

345
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:36,333
Well that's very
nice of you to say.

346
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:38,375
And thank you
for reading my books.

347
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:45,083
Thanks for being so amazing!

348
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:47,583
I'm gonna brag to all my
friends at school about this!

349
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:49,875
Bye, bye.

350
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:51,708
Good luck at work,
we'll see ya soon!

351
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:54,791
Go straight home and
be careful, wenches!

352
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:57,541
Oh, good grief. Seriously,
how much more will you have to

353
00:17:57,625 --> 00:17:59,458
push me around
before you're satisfied?

354
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:01,750
Hold on a second, that's not
what I was doing at all?

355
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:03,291
And why are you being a jerk?

356
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:05,250
I don't care for
your crass language.

357
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:07,208
I like the regular
Shusuke much better.

358
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:08,875
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

359
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:13,958
Then again, you are
still pretty amazing.

360
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:16,375
She read me.
But it's only because of you.

361
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:19,291
That review's the only
reason she gave it a chance.

362
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:22,250
Your writing has that
kind of power over people.

363
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:24,708
No, no, you've got it
backwards, it wasn't me.

364
00:18:24,791 --> 00:18:26,750
All I did was describe
the basic story-line

365
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:28,375
and gave a few honest
comments on the way

366
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:30,916
you approached it.
Your words inspired me.

367
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
You're the one with
the power here.

368
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:34,958
Well. That's nice.

369
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:37,958
And it feels good to know there
are readers out there who care.

370
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:43,291
It makes it all worth it. But.
It's scary. I don't know if

371
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:45,625
I have the courage
to put out a third book.

372
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,125
What if I disappoint them?

373
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:51,125
What if the next one's
worse than my last? No.

374
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:53,583
I guess I just don't want
people to turn away from me

375
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:56,541
the way that Eriko did.

376
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:58,958
Oh, who cares what
she thinks about anything.

377
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:00,875
Besides, that's just her
backwards way of trying

378
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:02,041
to be helpful.

379
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:03,583
You really think so?

380
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:06,083
Yes, of course. And so what
if she doesn't like your book,

381
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:08,833
there are plenty
of people who do!

382
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:11,166
"The only thing that I really
want is for as many people

383
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:14,000
as possible to read my book".
One of my favorite writers

384
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:15,625
of all time said that to me.

385
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:18,958
Oh yeah?

386
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:20,916
If you've got another book
in you, then write it.

387
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,666
Cause you have some real
fans. Not just those girls.

388
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,916
There are a lot
of people waiting out there.

389
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,416
They're chomping at the bit
to read your next story.

390
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,750
So just keep on writing, okay?

391
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:32,833
Thank you, I will.

392
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:39,500
Are you a fan? Really?

393
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:46,500
We only exist in order
to protect Takashi.

394
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:48,791
Well yeah.

395
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:51,583
I've always been one of
your biggest fans, Hiyoko.

396
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:53,541
And I always will be.

397
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:54,916
Thanks.

398
00:19:58,083 --> 00:20:01,000
Never fear, 'cause Shusuke
is here! What the-?

399
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:03,708
That sorry excuse for
a routine just won't cut it.

400
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:06,083
If you wanna be rich and famous,
do what all the stars do,

401
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:07,291
and take off your clothes!

402
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:08,750
I'm sorry.

403
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:11,166
This is all my fault; it's
because of my two left feet!

404
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,500
Don't give up.

405
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:15,000
I believe in you, Kinako,
I know you can do it!

406
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:17,416
Oh man, are you
two at it again?

407
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,666
We are A-lex Two!

408
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:23,833
You sure have that pose down!
Oh boy, I can already tell that

409
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:25,875
this is going to result
in Hiyoko being pissed.

410
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:29,750
Ha. Come on, kid. Don't worry
about all that nonsense.

411
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:33,291
Man up. Just be yourself!

412
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:35,833
You're so right.
My name is Shusuke!

413
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:38,375
And I was brought to this
planet to inspire the masses!

414
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:40,250
All right!
Let's rock the house!

415
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:41,625
Yeah!

416
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:47,791
Hey. What's wrong, you okay?

417
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:52,583
I took my manuscript to the
publisher today and guess what?

418
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:55,875
They green-lit
my third novel on the spot!

419
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:58,791
Uh. You don't say.
They did, huh?

420
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:00,291
It's the best one yet!

421
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:03,125
I've never felt this confident
about a story in my life!

422
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:05,250
But you- You pissed me off!

423
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:06,875
Those things
you said really hurt.

424
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:09,666
It made me lose confidence
and stop believing in myself!

425
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,583
Cause of you, I was scared
to put out my third book

426
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:13,125
cause I was
worried it would suck.

427
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:15,083
You made me think
I wasn't any good.

428
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:16,833
And that I'd be
better off giving up!

429
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:18,208
Hold on a sec.

430
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:19,666
Don't blame me, I just
gave you my honest opinion.

431
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,625
Shut up! Now!

432
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:24,541
When I first started writing,
you were so constructive.

433
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:27,375
But now it's nothing but
sarcasm and condemnation.

434
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:30,583
Be nicer to me, okay?
Like you were before.

435
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:34,583
I just miss being your friend.
That's all that I care about.

436
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:41,250
Eriko. Please be more
kind. Cause I love you!

437
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,708
That's sweet of you to say.

438
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:47,583
I miss you too, and
I miss being your friend.

439
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:49,583
I love you so much. Truly.

440
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:55,208
You guys. I feel
the exact same way.

441
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:58,291
I'd say this officially marks
the birth of the Alex Three!

442
00:21:58,375 --> 00:22:00,416
I love you, you're the best!

443
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,541
Man, I sure hope
they do each other.

444
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:08,291
Hold on! What about me?!

445
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:40,208
I'm sorry. But it
didn't make any sense

446
00:23:40,291 --> 00:23:42,291
to have a guy
in our show tonight.

447
00:23:42,375 --> 00:23:44,208
Come on, don't be mad.

448
00:23:47,166 --> 00:23:49,458
I'm only joking. Just relax.

449
00:23:49,541 --> 00:23:54,208
But- You- Oh.
You know my third book?

450
00:23:54,291 --> 00:23:56,958
I finished it up
a long time ago.

451
00:23:57,041 --> 00:23:59,958
But I was just
too scared to submit it.

452
00:24:00,041 --> 00:24:02,791
Thanks to you,
I got my confidence back.

453
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:05,666
I didn't do anything,
I'm just a fan.

454
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:09,458
Thank you, and I hope you
always will be. I mean it.

455
00:24:09,541 --> 00:24:11,541
Huh? I'm sorry. What was that?

456
00:24:11,625 --> 00:24:13,083
Don't worry about it.

457
00:24:14,875 --> 00:24:17,708
Hey, wait up Hiyoko!
Come back here!

458
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:25,291
This is DJ Condor,
coming at you, once again,

459
00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:27,416
from the great beyond.
I'm broadcasting straight

460
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,833
from the grave, six feet
under, taking a dirt nap

461
00:24:29,916 --> 00:24:32,625
in that casket in the ground.
I don't need your condolences,

462
00:24:32,708 --> 00:24:34,541
but what I do need is
a sticky bun, so if you're

463
00:24:34,625 --> 00:24:36,958
feeling generous bring one by.
But don't forget your shovel!
