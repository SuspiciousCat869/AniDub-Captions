1
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:06,904
Shit!

2
00:00:17,263 --> 00:00:19,687
Oh. You’re awake. I’m glad.

3
00:00:19,988 --> 00:00:22,784
Just hang in there for a bit. We’ll be okay.

4
00:00:23,547 --> 00:00:25,446
At least Historia’s all right.

5
00:00:25,835 --> 00:00:27,432
Eren, listen.

6
00:00:28,345 --> 00:00:30,881
My father has always been humanity’s ally.

7
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:33,995
His only goal is to keep the people within the walls safe.

8
00:00:34,075 --> 00:00:36,465
It’s clear to me now that we misunderstood him.

9
00:00:37,107 --> 00:00:38,665
He didn’t deny anything.

10
00:00:39,052 --> 00:00:41,034
It’s true that he went after the Scouts,

11
00:00:41,263 --> 00:00:43,306
and his people did kill Pastor Nick.

12
00:00:43,721 --> 00:00:45,840
But he did that because he had no choice!

13
00:00:46,162 --> 00:00:49,065
Everything he’s done, he did for the sake of humanity.

14
00:00:50,001 --> 00:00:51,282
Thank you, Historia.

15
00:00:51,482 --> 00:00:53,578
Please let me explain the rest.

16
00:00:58,837 --> 00:01:00,387
It’s coming back to me.

17
00:01:01,034 --> 00:01:05,179
Yeah. The last thing I remember is the two of them.

18
00:01:06,473 --> 00:01:07,991
How long has it been?

19
00:01:08,679 --> 00:01:10,668
Captain. Armin.

20
00:01:11,152 --> 00:01:12,702
What happened to the Scouts?

21
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,316
What’s the deal with all these glowing pillars?

22
00:01:22,629 --> 00:01:23,969
They just keep going.

23
00:01:24,388 --> 00:01:26,646
I can’t even tell if its day or night.

24
00:01:27,761 --> 00:01:31,254
Wait, there’s something else about this place.

25
00:01:31,812 --> 00:01:33,806
It feels familiar somehow.

26
00:01:34,591 --> 00:01:35,935
Have I been here?

27
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:37,587
If you were wondering, no.

28
00:01:37,886 --> 00:01:39,533
You’ve never been here before.

29
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:43,466
Although, you may recognize it nonetheless.

30
00:01:44,697 --> 00:01:46,381
What’s that supposed to mean?

31
00:01:49,003 --> 00:01:51,824
Um, Father? Could you explain to Eren?

32
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,898
Of course. I intend to.

33
00:01:54,586 --> 00:01:57,362
But before that, there’s something I’d like us to try.

34
00:01:58,559 --> 00:02:01,834
This could make him remember without us saying a word.

35
00:02:13,816 --> 00:02:16,319
What is this? Who’re they?

36
00:02:16,819 --> 00:02:18,671
These aren’t things I’ve seen.

37
00:02:19,799 --> 00:02:20,578
No.

38
00:02:21,422 --> 00:02:23,131
Whose memories are these?

39
00:02:24,838 --> 00:02:25,570
The key!

40
00:02:27,706 --> 00:02:30,663
No. Why?

41
00:02:51,758 --> 00:02:53,901
Dad? What happened to you?

42
00:03:01,983 --> 00:03:02,845
Well?

43
00:03:07,878 --> 00:03:11,735
Do you remember? Have you learned of your father’s sin?

44
00:04:51,043 --> 00:04:52,729
That’s amazing, Historia!

45
00:04:52,798 --> 00:04:54,731
Just look how well you can read now!

46
00:04:55,442 --> 00:04:58,594
Thank you, but I only learned how
because you were here to teach me.

47
00:04:58,619 --> 00:05:01,493
Ah. That runny nose of yours needs some tending to.

48
00:05:01,922 --> 00:05:05,100
I guess the next thing I should
teach you is how to act more ladylike.

49
00:05:05,628 --> 00:05:06,608
Blow into this.

50
00:05:09,637 --> 00:05:13,036
Ooh! Now that’s what I call a job well done.

51
00:05:15,298 --> 00:05:15,893
Hey?

52
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:16,495
Hmm?

53
00:05:16,843 --> 00:05:19,283
What’s it mean to act ladylike?

54
00:05:19,449 --> 00:05:26,346
Hmmm. I’m not exactly an expert, but...
I’d say the young lady in your book has it down.

55
00:05:26,646 --> 00:05:27,623
Christa?

56
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:31,114
Yeah. Is she one of your favorite characters?

57
00:05:31,494 --> 00:05:32,154
Mhm.

58
00:05:32,837 --> 00:05:36,976
Christa’s always thinking about other people
and helping them out in whatever way she can.

59
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:39,439
That’s what I think makes a proper lady.

60
00:05:40,403 --> 00:05:43,738
You’ll find pain and suffering
everywhere you look in this world.

61
00:05:44,273 --> 00:05:46,416
So do your best to make things better.

62
00:05:46,497 --> 00:05:49,069
Treat people with love, and they’ll love you in return.

63
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:54,210
Well that’s how you act. So I wanna be just like you.

64
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:54,774
Huh?

65
00:05:55,525 --> 00:05:59,287
Do you think that if I try real
hard I can grow up to be like you?

66
00:06:01,955 --> 00:06:02,852
No need!

67
00:06:03,273 --> 00:06:06,253
You’re already perfect! No need to change a thing!

68
00:06:14,302 --> 00:06:17,392
I’m sorry, Historia, but I have to go now.

69
00:06:17,733 --> 00:06:20,301
That means you need to forget all about me again.

70
00:06:20,888 --> 00:06:22,064
Until next time.

71
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:23,412
Huh?

72
00:06:36,004 --> 00:06:40,281
Huh. I wonder who that girl is.

73
00:06:51,698 --> 00:06:53,685
What’s wrong? Are you all right?

74
00:06:54,564 --> 00:06:59,334
How could...? How could I forget? In all that time.

75
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:04,092
I was never alone. I had her.

76
00:07:05,104 --> 00:07:06,890
She was always there for me.

77
00:07:08,189 --> 00:07:11,719
She gave me books. Taught me to read and write.

78
00:07:12,343 --> 00:07:14,284
She was so kind to me.

79
00:07:14,903 --> 00:07:16,858
So how could I forget about her?

80
00:07:18,124 --> 00:07:20,291
I take it you’re talking about Frieda.

81
00:07:21,153 --> 00:07:22,071
Frieda?

82
00:07:22,658 --> 00:07:26,264
If it was a kind-hearted young
woman with long, black hair,

83
00:07:26,878 --> 00:07:29,404
then I would imagine that it was Frieda Reiss.

84
00:07:29,624 --> 00:07:32,105
She was your half-sister.

85
00:07:33,406 --> 00:07:37,079
She must have been worried and gone
to check up on you from time to time.

86
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:40,519
If she was erasing your memories,

87
00:07:40,782 --> 00:07:42,855
know that she did it to protect you.

88
00:07:43,324 --> 00:07:45,922
So, that’s why I forgot her?

89
00:07:46,213 --> 00:07:49,973
That’s right. But touching him seems to
have brought those memories back to you.

90
00:07:50,533 --> 00:07:52,451
An unexpected side-effect.

91
00:07:55,093 --> 00:07:57,155
Father, where is she?

92
00:07:57,286 --> 00:07:59,204
Do you think we could visit her sometime?

93
00:08:00,623 --> 00:08:02,365
I’d like to tell her thank you.

94
00:08:04,701 --> 00:08:06,465
If she hadn’t been there for me, I...

95
00:08:06,838 --> 00:08:09,809
I wouldn’t have had anyone. I need to thank her.

96
00:08:13,624 --> 00:08:16,197
Frieda is no longer of this world.

97
00:08:19,549 --> 00:08:21,964
At one time, I had five children.

98
00:08:24,348 --> 00:08:30,807
But five years ago, my wife and our children
were murdered by a man named Grisha Jaegar.

99
00:08:31,388 --> 00:08:33,994
Your sister was killed by Eren’s father.

100
00:08:42,498 --> 00:08:45,500
Grisha had the ability to transform into a Titan.

101
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,327
I still don’t know where he obtained it.

102
00:08:51,244 --> 00:08:54,588
But his goal was to steal something from the Reiss family.

103
00:08:56,222 --> 00:08:58,807
What Grisha sought to obtain was power.

104
00:09:00,579 --> 00:09:04,431
The power of the Reiss family which resided within Frieda.

105
00:09:07,761 --> 00:09:11,319
Frieda’s Titan was by far superior to all the others.

106
00:09:12,067 --> 00:09:15,120
In theory, she had unsurpassable power.

107
00:09:16,247 --> 00:09:21,459
However, at her young age, she lacked
the experience to wield it properly.

108
00:09:22,873 --> 00:09:26,066
And because she couldn’t unleash her true potential,

109
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:30,547
Grisha ate her, and in doing so, stole her power.

110
00:09:32,709 --> 00:09:34,478
But that wasn’t enough.

111
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:36,854
He then turned his gaze to the children.

112
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,070
He wanted to eradicate the Reiss family.

113
00:09:41,727 --> 00:09:44,194
He started by crushing Dirk and Abel,

114
00:09:44,388 --> 00:09:46,111
who were fourteen and twelve.

115
00:09:46,412 --> 00:09:50,029
He trampled my wife as she held our ten-year-old Florian.

116
00:09:50,171 --> 00:09:53,667
He squeezed the life from my eldest son, Ulklin.

117
00:09:54,521 --> 00:09:58,720
Through some curse or miracle, I alone managed to escape.

118
00:10:04,508 --> 00:10:05,767
It’s not fair.

119
00:10:07,659 --> 00:10:09,423
She didn’t deserve that.

120
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:13,682
Why would he do such a terrible thing?

121
00:10:23,211 --> 00:10:25,971
Hey, hey, hey! What’s the holdup?

122
00:10:28,422 --> 00:10:31,214
Whatever you’re talkin’ about, we don’t have time for it.

123
00:10:32,492 --> 00:10:34,734
Thing’s are goin’ straight to hell outside.

124
00:10:35,717 --> 00:10:38,643
Do explain. What’s been going on?

125
00:10:39,136 --> 00:10:43,553
Well, the Scouts started a coup d’état, and
all the other regiments have taken their side.

126
00:10:43,868 --> 00:10:46,611
Everyone found out that ol’ King Fritz was a fake.

127
00:10:46,808 --> 00:10:49,090
And now his whole council has been arrested.

128
00:10:49,395 --> 00:10:51,616
Yup, it’s been a royal shitshow.

129
00:10:53,598 --> 00:10:55,558
Matter of time ’til they show up here.

130
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:57,575
So you’d best get a move on.

131
00:10:58,272 --> 00:10:59,728
All right then, I will.

132
00:11:00,072 --> 00:11:04,178
Now take the Anti-Personnel Control
Squad and defend the entrance at all costs.

133
00:11:04,437 --> 00:11:05,313
Uh...

134
00:11:05,424 --> 00:11:09,668
I already told you that the ceremony can’t
be done in the presence of you or your crew.

135
00:11:09,873 --> 00:11:13,130
Aww! Where’s the trust, Your Majesty? Did I make ya mad?

136
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,677
Fine. Sorry. I’m just so worried about you.

137
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:23,833
I trust you. It’s because of
that trust that you’re here. Now go.

138
00:11:23,921 --> 00:11:26,153
I feel the same, Your Grace.

139
00:11:27,863 --> 00:11:28,348
Tch.

140
00:11:38,747 --> 00:11:40,805
From now on, whenever you eat,

141
00:11:41,254 --> 00:11:43,944
you’ll be digesting your meals from the bottom up.

142
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,743
As always, you’ll wear the finest of clothes,

143
00:11:47,827 --> 00:11:50,125
but only from your feet to your knees.

144
00:11:50,177 --> 00:11:51,945
And so you don’t get lonely,

145
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:55,211
I’ll take you out once a week to be paraded to the public.

146
00:11:56,762 --> 00:12:02,735
It’s so beautiful. This may well be the
finest work of art man has ever conceived.

147
00:12:03,235 --> 00:12:06,324
All those decades of planning it have finally paid off.

148
00:12:06,645 --> 00:12:10,075
Just wait. Art must be completed by its audience.

149
00:12:10,168 --> 00:12:13,619
You must be seen by the people,
the same ones you tyrannized.

150
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,692
And that will be my masterpiece.

151
00:12:15,717 --> 00:12:18,821
Zachary! You’ll pay for this tenfold.

152
00:12:19,022 --> 00:12:22,452
The blood of slaves runs through
your veins, and nothing’ll change that!

153
00:12:22,688 --> 00:12:25,377
You will never be the equal of a noble like me.

154
00:12:26,562 --> 00:12:31,327
Soon enough, you’ll forget any of this
happened. I bet you’ll even forget how to shit!

155
00:12:31,428 --> 00:12:35,668
As long as we’re on the subject, why don’t
you tell me if you nobles really do shit gold?

156
00:12:35,729 --> 00:12:38,191
I’m sorry, what was that? Your mouth’s full!

157
00:12:40,252 --> 00:12:41,830
This could end badly.

158
00:12:42,312 --> 00:12:45,676
All the members of the king’s
council are telling us the same thing.

159
00:12:45,886 --> 00:12:48,464
It’s just as your late father speculated.

160
00:12:49,513 --> 00:12:53,500
The Reiss family has the power to
alter people’s memories as it suits them.

161
00:12:53,968 --> 00:12:55,263
From what I’ve been told,

162
00:12:55,336 --> 00:13:00,388
aside from those of a few noble bloodlines that’re
immune, whole cities could be affected at once.

163
00:13:01,597 --> 00:13:02,900
So they could still...

164
00:13:03,463 --> 00:13:06,959
In the event that Lord Reiss is
able to obtain Eren’s "Scream,"

165
00:13:06,983 --> 00:13:10,288
this uprising of ours will
amount to absolutely nothing.

166
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:15,278
If you ask me, that’s why the
council members have been so cooperative.

167
00:13:15,764 --> 00:13:17,956
They don’t think it’s worth getting beaten.

168
00:13:18,623 --> 00:13:21,761
Right. Because if this ability should come into play,

169
00:13:22,013 --> 00:13:23,732
we’ll forget everything they told us.

170
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:29,604
Although, I’d imagine that they’d
prefer whatever torture we could throw at them

171
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:33,219
if they knew what would await them
once they’re given up to Zachary.

172
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,673
I don’t understand him.

173
00:13:35,892 --> 00:13:39,957
To think that he would dedicate so
much of his life to such a morbid goal.

174
00:13:40,148 --> 00:13:42,657
So then, you knew what he was planning?

175
00:13:43,048 --> 00:13:45,757
Mmm. ’Twas a slip of the tongue.

176
00:13:46,612 --> 00:13:47,862
I suspected.

177
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:51,801
At the very least I knew his motives were perverse.

178
00:13:52,337 --> 00:13:55,258
And unlike you, I’m none too fond of gambling.

179
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,722
Also, unlike you...

180
00:13:58,763 --> 00:14:02,655
...I’m willing to die if it means
protecting what’s left of humanity.

181
00:14:04,221 --> 00:14:09,329
The only reason I backed you was because I
believed it to be the best choice for the human race.

182
00:14:10,172 --> 00:14:12,435
Had the government passed my little test,

183
00:14:13,078 --> 00:14:16,416
I was prepared to make a stand against you and Zachary.

184
00:14:17,617 --> 00:14:23,067
To think, we just stood as comrades in a
coup d’état, and I’m already talking like this.

185
00:14:23,713 --> 00:14:27,371
I once heard in a song that
someday humans would stop fighting.

186
00:14:28,068 --> 00:14:29,389
When will that be?

187
00:14:31,038 --> 00:14:33,308
Commander! The wagons are ready, sir.

188
00:14:33,418 --> 00:14:34,619
Troops are standing by.

189
00:14:35,294 --> 00:14:36,595
We await your command.

190
00:14:39,015 --> 00:14:41,133
Peace between men will never be certain.

191
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:43,906
Not until our numbers fall to one or less.

192
00:14:45,146 --> 00:14:45,971
Shit.

193
00:14:46,713 --> 00:14:49,960
Here I was hoping you might
have something optimistic to say.

194
00:14:50,603 --> 00:14:51,817
Your attention!

195
00:14:52,473 --> 00:14:54,185
Soldiers of the Survey Corps,

196
00:14:54,366 --> 00:14:56,910
our mission is to recover Eren and Historia.

197
00:14:57,284 --> 00:15:01,217
We will now make for their location,
believed to be the chapel on Reiss’ land!

198
00:15:04,214 --> 00:15:07,001
You should understand. This is Kenny the Ripper.

199
00:15:07,454 --> 00:15:09,702
If he’s there, he’s our biggest obstacle.

200
00:15:10,502 --> 00:15:13,643
In terms of his threat level,
it’s like you’ll be fighting me.

201
00:15:14,107 --> 00:15:17,463
Or wait. With those weapons of his, he’ll be stronger.

202
00:15:17,556 --> 00:15:20,293
Then he’s unbeatable. At least for us.

203
00:15:20,332 --> 00:15:22,866
Maybe we should wait and meet up with other soldiers.

204
00:15:22,891 --> 00:15:24,107
No chance in hell.

205
00:15:24,258 --> 00:15:25,607
Right. Course not.

206
00:15:25,938 --> 00:15:28,641
If we wait for reinforcements, then Eren might get eaten.

207
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:31,883
You know, based on what the captain just told us,

208
00:15:32,228 --> 00:15:34,600
the odds won’t be entirely in Kenny’s favor.

209
00:15:34,838 --> 00:15:35,911
...You really think so?

210
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:40,274
...Yeah. His squad is well-trained,
but we have way more combat experience.

211
00:15:40,348 --> 00:15:44,992
Have to ask. How is it that you lived with
Kenny the Ripper but know next to nothing about him?

212
00:15:45,071 --> 00:15:46,688
Did the two of you never talk?

213
00:15:46,742 --> 00:15:50,625
Not much. I only just learned the man’s last name.

214
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:53,279
Dunno if you heard, but it’s Ackermann.

215
00:15:53,903 --> 00:15:55,622
Might be a relative of yours.

216
00:15:59,186 --> 00:16:01,216
I remember my parents saying that

217
00:16:01,838 --> 00:16:03,902
my dad’s side, the Ackermanns,

218
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:07,065
were persecuted when they lived in the cities.

219
00:16:08,382 --> 00:16:10,933
My mom said her ancestors were eastern.

220
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:14,143
Her family’s appearance made
it difficult for them to fit in.

221
00:16:14,853 --> 00:16:18,031
Both groups were chased deep in the
mountains near the edge of the walls.

222
00:16:18,507 --> 00:16:19,993
That’s how my parents met.

223
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:24,338
But my father never told me why
the Ackermanns were persecuted.

224
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,817
He looked the same as all of you,

225
00:16:27,466 --> 00:16:29,892
so I don’t think he was of a different race.

226
00:16:31,433 --> 00:16:32,591
Tell me this.

227
00:16:33,066 --> 00:16:37,143
Have you ever suddenly felt a "power" awaken inside you?

228
00:16:44,814 --> 00:16:45,842
I have.

229
00:16:52,907 --> 00:16:55,385
This has happened for Kenny Ackermann as well.

230
00:16:55,793 --> 00:17:00,646
Suddenly, out of nowhere, he felt an
absurd amount of strength surging through him.

231
00:17:01,574 --> 00:17:05,085
And in that moment, he knew just what he needed to do.

232
00:17:05,977 --> 00:17:08,756
And it’s happened to me too. Makes me wonder.

233
00:17:23,351 --> 00:17:24,819
Fess up, Gramps.

234
00:17:26,476 --> 00:17:28,738
C’mon. You’re dyin’ anyway.

235
00:17:31,678 --> 00:17:36,770
Ah, Kenny. I take it you were just
out killin’ more of the Military Police.

236
00:17:37,177 --> 00:17:41,259
Yeah. If you’re talkin’ about those
goons what were snoopin’ around here,

237
00:17:41,397 --> 00:17:43,682
they’re in the ground helping the trees grow now.

238
00:17:46,623 --> 00:17:48,243
Speakin’ of trees and such,

239
00:17:48,552 --> 00:17:51,517
there’s a branch of the family
that moved south to Shiganshina.

240
00:17:52,522 --> 00:17:56,308
Guess they should’a changed the name when they
left, ’cause they’re still gettin’ screwed with.

241
00:17:56,563 --> 00:17:58,857
So of course, they’re still poor as dirt.

242
00:17:59,525 --> 00:18:01,383
What in the hell happened to us?

243
00:18:01,873 --> 00:18:05,722
I thought that the Ackermann clan used
to be the king’s personal bodyguards.

244
00:18:06,039 --> 00:18:08,803
Now the whole damn family’s on the verge of extinction.

245
00:18:09,295 --> 00:18:12,339
So why don’t you tell me what
you did to piss off the king?

246
00:18:15,263 --> 00:18:18,495
C’mon, won’t ya tell your sweet grandson one last story?

247
00:18:24,219 --> 00:18:26,836
What sweet grandson are you talkin’ about?

248
00:18:27,089 --> 00:18:31,659
Surely not the infamous "Kenny the
Ripper" who’s been terrorizin’ the capital.

249
00:18:32,688 --> 00:18:36,237
It ain’t that the monarchy hates us or has any cause to.

250
00:18:36,858 --> 00:18:38,858
They’re just afraid of us, is all.

251
00:18:39,372 --> 00:18:44,159
Reason bein’ we Ackermann’s are one of a
few families the king can’t quite control.

252
00:18:44,798 --> 00:18:46,119
What do you mean by that?

253
00:18:46,938 --> 00:18:49,561
Can’t tell ya the whole story, ’cause I don’t know it.

254
00:18:49,923 --> 00:18:53,842
But it’s true that our family was
once honored and trusted by the king.

255
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:56,701
More than that, from what I was told,

256
00:18:56,918 --> 00:18:59,380
we Ackermanns were once the king’s sword.

257
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:05,441
For generations, each king has passed
the Power of the Titans to his successor.

258
00:19:06,723 --> 00:19:09,749
Huh? Power of the Titans? What’s that?

259
00:19:10,199 --> 00:19:13,195
I don’t know how it works,
or what all else there is to it,

260
00:19:13,219 --> 00:19:16,478
but this power allows the king to wipe out human memory.

261
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:18,122
To erase the past.

262
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:21,802
Only a few noble bloodlines are immune.

263
00:19:22,218 --> 00:19:26,316
Among them, there were two groups that
decided to turn their back on the king.

264
00:19:27,189 --> 00:19:31,607
One of these groups was the Eastern clan,
and the other was our own Ackermann clan.

265
00:19:32,554 --> 00:19:34,315
Hence all the persecution.

266
00:19:35,335 --> 00:19:36,976
And nothing can end it.

267
00:19:41,672 --> 00:19:46,583
Ain’t the heartwarming story you wanna hear
on your deathbed, but I found my little sister.

268
00:19:48,068 --> 00:19:50,928
Kuchel’s been working at a brothel in the underground.

269
00:19:51,288 --> 00:19:53,207
She got knocked up by a customer.

270
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:56,720
I couldn’t convince her to get rid of the thing.

271
00:19:58,301 --> 00:20:02,559
Oh, hell. Who’d wanna be born
into this piece of shit world, anyway?

272
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:05,649
There isn’t a dream you could
have worth sufferin’ through it.

273
00:20:10,482 --> 00:20:13,053
Found it. A hidden door.

274
00:20:13,721 --> 00:20:15,890
Reiss and Eren should be inside.

275
00:20:16,383 --> 00:20:18,949
Hopefully the layout’s close to what I predicted.

276
00:20:19,378 --> 00:20:21,231
These presents better pay off.

277
00:20:21,315 --> 00:20:23,327
Considering the time we spent prepping them.

278
00:20:26,873 --> 00:20:28,794
We count at least seven enemies,

279
00:20:29,643 --> 00:20:31,885
and you can bet Captain Levi’s among them.

280
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:36,422
As you all know, last time we caught Levi by surprise.

281
00:20:36,738 --> 00:20:38,749
And then he killed twelve of our comrades.

282
00:20:40,888 --> 00:20:43,944
The government’s been overthrown,
which means we’re the fugitives now.

283
00:20:44,338 --> 00:20:46,448
So I wouldn’t count on getting any backup.

284
00:20:47,149 --> 00:20:48,736
We’re in some deep shit.

285
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,746
In this tiny, screwed-up world,

286
00:20:51,998 --> 00:20:55,798
dying is preferable to what we
would get if we decided to surrender.

287
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:03,314
That’s what life in the walls
has always been. Nothing’s changed.

288
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:06,564
We’ve got a foe we can’t beat.

289
00:21:06,652 --> 00:21:08,104
So we stand by and wait

290
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:10,608
for them to break through our walls and kill us.

291
00:21:11,189 --> 00:21:14,971
We fought to be Military Police, and then Interior Police.

292
00:21:15,115 --> 00:21:16,899
And now we’re Kenny’s elites.

293
00:21:17,078 --> 00:21:20,348
We did this to find purpose in our meaningless lives

294
00:21:20,516 --> 00:21:22,112
in this meaningless world.

295
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:24,591
I see no cause to stop believing now.

296
00:21:25,139 --> 00:21:28,063
If Kenny and his dream can’t turn this game around,

297
00:21:28,357 --> 00:21:29,882
he’ll flip the board.

298
00:21:32,971 --> 00:21:35,507
’Kay. We should be ready to go now.

299
00:21:35,612 --> 00:21:39,060
All right then. Is everyone here ready?

300
00:21:39,542 --> 00:21:41,953
’Cause you’re all about to dirty your hands.

301
00:21:49,706 --> 00:21:51,396
Guess that’s a yes.

302
00:23:40,395 --> 00:23:42,442
To protect their leader's wish.

303
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:44,875
To save their greatest hope.

304
00:23:45,669 --> 00:23:47,948
To preserve their dearest memories.

305
00:23:48,642 --> 00:23:52,095
Many different feelings lead them straight into battle.

306
00:23:52,714 --> 00:23:54,809
Next episode: "Wish."
