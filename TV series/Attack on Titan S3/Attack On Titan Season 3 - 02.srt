1
00:00:00,873 --> 00:00:03,413
Long time, Levi.

2
00:00:04,036 --> 00:00:06,376
Still a runt, or have you grown some?

3
00:00:09,307 --> 00:00:10,545
Woo-hoo!

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:14,288
Nope. Don't look like you've changed much at all, boy.

5
00:00:15,345 --> 00:00:16,983
Kenny!

6
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:21,637
Boom!

7
00:02:08,467 --> 00:02:09,670
Those gunshots?

8
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:14,395
Are we being attacked or what? Just stay down. Hiyah!

9
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,071
Historia!

10
00:02:31,388 --> 00:02:32,619
Eren!

11
00:02:35,332 --> 00:02:36,283
Hiyah!

12
00:02:50,435 --> 00:02:53,121
Shit. They predicted our every damn movement.

13
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:04,182
Of all people,

14
00:03:04,262 --> 00:03:06,553
why the hell would you work with the MPs?

15
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:28,401
It's Levi of the Scouts!

16
00:03:29,052 --> 00:03:30,790
Make yourself at home, sir!

17
00:03:31,024 --> 00:03:32,332
Ready or not.

18
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:36,822
Shit. If this keeps up, I'll
lose my team, Eren, and Historia.

19
00:03:38,411 --> 00:03:39,873
It's the damnedest thing.

20
00:03:40,097 --> 00:03:43,581
I seem to be smellin' a rat in this fine establishment.

21
00:03:43,679 --> 00:03:45,498
Come on out, little rodent.

22
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:47,850
The sheriff is here!

23
00:03:48,111 --> 00:03:51,020
And I aim to exterminate all the vermin I can find.

24
00:03:51,124 --> 00:03:52,631
Bang! Bang!

25
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:54,800
Eek!

26
00:03:56,651 --> 00:03:59,235
Oh, come on! You here or not?

27
00:03:59,816 --> 00:04:02,302
Right here, Kenny. Been a while.

28
00:04:02,756 --> 00:04:05,028
I really thought you'd be dead by now,

29
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:07,530
what with all the MPs you were butcherin'.

30
00:04:07,855 --> 00:04:09,390
But now you're great friends, huh?

31
00:04:09,485 --> 00:04:12,758
Yeah, well, adults do plenty of
things kids like you can't understand.

32
00:04:12,868 --> 00:04:14,546
Oh, right. My mistake.

33
00:04:14,736 --> 00:04:18,979
You're s'posed to be an adult now, but
you're still such a runt it's hard to tell. Heh.

34
00:04:19,543 --> 00:04:22,641
Always hoped that I might get
to see you in action someday.

35
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:24,778
I can't say I'm disappointed, either.

36
00:04:25,024 --> 00:04:27,606
Seems you still remember every trick I taught ya.

37
00:04:28,496 --> 00:04:31,730
But didn't I ever tell you what happens to a cornered rat?

38
00:04:32,825 --> 00:04:37,204
'Cause if I had, you'd know that wherever
you run, you'll find a bullet waiting.

39
00:04:38,415 --> 00:04:40,380
Hey, Levi.

40
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:46,244
You must've become a scout for a reason.

41
00:04:46,415 --> 00:04:48,381
And I think I know what that is.

42
00:04:49,611 --> 00:04:52,509
We were forced to survive in that little hellhole.

43
00:04:52,681 --> 00:04:55,568
Giving everything we had just to stay alive.

44
00:04:56,316 --> 00:04:59,998
So when we found out just how big the world really was,

45
00:05:00,141 --> 00:05:02,416
you can bet it hurt like hell.

46
00:05:03,152 --> 00:05:04,814
But ya know what saved us?

47
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:08,265
We found something we enjoyed doing.

48
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:09,683
It's just that simple.

49
00:05:10,056 --> 00:05:12,187
Every man needs himself a hobby.

50
00:05:12,376 --> 00:05:15,927
May be the only source of fulfillment
he'll ever find in this wretched world.

51
00:05:16,023 --> 00:05:17,087
Oh, I see.

52
00:05:17,539 --> 00:05:20,078
Is that why you blew off my people's heads, then?

53
00:05:20,292 --> 00:05:21,415
'Cause it's fulfilling?

54
00:05:21,705 --> 00:05:26,234
Yup. To achieve my grand goal,
I'll kill as many as get in my way.

55
00:05:26,824 --> 00:05:30,047
And you're no different. You
kill too when it benefits you.

56
00:05:30,349 --> 00:05:30,969
Yeah.

57
00:05:35,403 --> 00:05:37,730
Wait! It's the captain.

58
00:05:38,265 --> 00:05:39,845
Thanks for the help, old man.

59
00:05:45,331 --> 00:05:47,421
Huh? A chair?

60
00:05:52,774 --> 00:05:55,078
Damn! Fire!

61
00:06:02,537 --> 00:06:03,562
I hear shooting!

62
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:04,375
Huh?

63
00:06:04,425 --> 00:06:05,232
From there!

64
00:06:06,278 --> 00:06:08,527
I-I heard close to a dozen shots!

65
00:06:10,219 --> 00:06:12,313
Do you think that they ran into some trouble?

66
00:06:12,554 --> 00:06:13,655
It seems likely.

67
00:06:14,972 --> 00:06:16,791
The captain gave me a message.

68
00:06:17,238 --> 00:06:19,652
As of now, it's not just Titans.

69
00:06:19,898 --> 00:06:21,583
We're fighting humans, too.

70
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:23,799
Huh? You don't mean...

71
00:06:24,538 --> 00:06:25,229
Hey!

72
00:06:28,573 --> 00:06:30,552
Are they running a training exercise?

73
00:06:31,878 --> 00:06:34,245
Commander. You're needed to check some papers.

74
00:06:37,803 --> 00:06:40,617
Captain. You finally bit the dust or what?

75
00:06:41,603 --> 00:06:43,176
What a dumb question.

76
00:06:43,406 --> 00:06:45,750
How would I answer if I was dead, Caven?

77
00:06:47,973 --> 00:06:49,387
Brat got me good.

78
00:06:49,727 --> 00:06:53,727
I forgot that bar owners are allowed
to keep guns to protect themselves.

79
00:06:53,933 --> 00:06:56,540
Looks like the runt grew up more than I figured.

80
00:06:56,788 --> 00:06:58,057
That's lovely, sir.

81
00:06:58,223 --> 00:07:00,723
Like hell. The boy's a thorn in my ass.

82
00:07:00,886 --> 00:07:03,477
My dream's slipping further and further away.

83
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,515
Look! There they are!

84
00:07:12,233 --> 00:07:13,502
Captain Levi!

85
00:07:17,587 --> 00:07:18,801
The hell is that?

86
00:07:30,114 --> 00:07:31,203
Follow the wagon!

87
00:07:32,323 --> 00:07:32,895
Right!

88
00:07:34,373 --> 00:07:37,313
Listen up! These soldiers were
trained to fight other people.

89
00:07:37,376 --> 00:07:39,275
They've already taken out three of ours.

90
00:07:40,123 --> 00:07:43,072
If you hesitate for so much as a second, you'll be dead.

91
00:07:43,265 --> 00:07:46,053
The moment you see an opening, go for the kill.

92
00:07:46,734 --> 00:07:47,436
Yes, sir.

93
00:07:53,642 --> 00:07:54,118
Tch.

94
00:07:54,476 --> 00:07:56,557
Armin! Secure the wagon with Jean!

95
00:07:56,748 --> 00:07:57,884
We'll keep you two covered.

96
00:07:57,972 --> 00:07:58,933
Uh... sir!

97
00:07:59,378 --> 00:08:00,142
He killed him.

98
00:08:00,627 --> 00:08:01,221
Come on!

99
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:08,429
Don't move!

100
00:08:12,237 --> 00:08:12,812
Stop.

101
00:08:19,498 --> 00:08:20,430
Jean!

102
00:08:35,437 --> 00:08:38,423
It's a shame that nothing came of our chat with Erwin.

103
00:08:39,108 --> 00:08:42,340
We're no closer to finding Eren Jaegar or Historia.

104
00:08:42,499 --> 00:08:46,934
At this rate, all of our actions against the
Scout Regiment will prove to be for nothing.

105
00:08:47,236 --> 00:08:48,082
True.

106
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:51,978
So, do we know what kind of information
they might have gotten out of Pastor Nick?

107
00:08:52,447 --> 00:08:55,849
No helping it. If our questions get specific,

108
00:08:55,928 --> 00:08:59,337
we'll risk giving them information
they didn't have in the first place.

109
00:08:59,392 --> 00:09:02,266
No. What they learned is irrelevant.

110
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:05,750
All that matters now is what they tried to learn.

111
00:09:06,082 --> 00:09:08,552
The Charter of Humanity is clear on this.

112
00:09:08,647 --> 00:09:11,150
We'll deal with them as the law dictates.

113
00:09:13,998 --> 00:09:14,478
Hm?

114
00:09:16,363 --> 00:09:18,142
This is from Lord Reiss.

115
00:09:21,334 --> 00:09:23,440
He's captured Eren and Historia.

116
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:27,779
And he's going to take direct action
against Erwin and the Scout Regiment.

117
00:09:28,089 --> 00:09:30,487
He requires no assistance at this time.

118
00:09:32,601 --> 00:09:33,722
That's the last of it.

119
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:37,417
If you want any of your personal
effects returned, ask for them later.

120
00:09:37,505 --> 00:09:38,949
No. That's fine.

121
00:09:39,911 --> 00:09:42,151
But if you have a moment, I'd like to talk.

122
00:09:42,365 --> 00:09:45,344
I'm not really in the mood to reminisce about old times.

123
00:09:45,463 --> 00:09:46,862
Why so cold, Nile?

124
00:09:47,063 --> 00:09:49,794
We were like brothers back in our days as cadets.

125
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:54,855
Quite soon, this tiny world of ours will be changed.

126
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:57,486
Will that change bring hope or despair?

127
00:09:57,986 --> 00:10:00,466
Can we trust the crown with the future of humanity?

128
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:01,927
Who should decide?

129
00:10:03,341 --> 00:10:04,470
Who has the right?

130
00:10:05,248 --> 00:10:06,773
Who will you trust, Nile?

131
00:10:08,314 --> 00:10:10,069
Erwin. Tell me.

132
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:11,991
What are you planning to do?

133
00:10:13,932 --> 00:10:16,481
I'll make a gamble, same as always.

134
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,860
Was it like this for you?

135
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,635
I'm sorry.

136
00:10:34,937 --> 00:10:35,821
It's okay.

137
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:38,219
I'm sorry. I...

138
00:10:52,325 --> 00:10:54,708
Shit! Armin! Jean!

139
00:11:08,123 --> 00:11:10,538
Let 'em go. We're running on fumes.

140
00:11:10,563 --> 00:11:11,349
No!

141
00:11:15,334 --> 00:11:17,640
Eren!

142
00:11:25,371 --> 00:11:28,889
What's wrong? Did all this filth kill your appetite?

143
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:33,983
No. Jean, there's something I don't understand.

144
00:11:34,415 --> 00:11:35,318
What's that?

145
00:11:36,223 --> 00:11:38,527
When I turned around to try to save you...

146
00:11:39,489 --> 00:11:42,086
...that woman already had her gun to your head.

147
00:11:42,634 --> 00:11:47,456
It's... funny. How could I have shot before she did?

148
00:11:52,398 --> 00:11:53,328
I don't know.

149
00:11:54,218 --> 00:11:56,332
You shot first because she hesitated.

150
00:11:57,124 --> 00:11:57,920
It's simple.

151
00:11:59,644 --> 00:12:04,348
I'm sorry, Armin. You wouldn't've
had to save me if I'd just done my job.

152
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:06,109
I know what it is.

153
00:12:07,397 --> 00:12:08,955
The woman I shot back there.

154
00:12:09,623 --> 00:12:11,545
I bet she was a really kind person.

155
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:15,781
She must've had a lot more human empathy than I ever did.

156
00:12:16,345 --> 00:12:18,489
I pulled that trigger so easily.

157
00:12:18,688 --> 00:12:19,807
Without a thought.

158
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:21,198
I'm...

159
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:22,581
A killer.

160
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,226
And now that your hands have been soaked in blood,

161
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,682
the person you once were is gone for good.

162
00:12:28,327 --> 00:12:29,731
Why would you say that?

163
00:12:29,858 --> 00:12:32,187
And you shouldn't regret it for one second.

164
00:12:33,134 --> 00:12:35,755
Because if you'd chosen to keep your hands clean,

165
00:12:36,462 --> 00:12:39,011
Jean would be a corpse on a cart right now.

166
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,089
I'll tell you why you pulled the trigger.

167
00:12:45,788 --> 00:12:48,101
Because your comrade was about to die.

168
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:52,732
Armin. Everyone on our squad survived today

169
00:12:53,113 --> 00:12:55,242
because you got blood on your hands.

170
00:12:56,847 --> 00:12:57,611
Thank you.

171
00:13:02,719 --> 00:13:08,264
Captain Levi, I, uh, I thought it was
wrong for us to fight other humans, sir.

172
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:11,346
I thought it was wrong that you'd ordered us to do it.

173
00:13:12,126 --> 00:13:15,137
I mean, we became soldiers to protect people.

174
00:13:15,867 --> 00:13:18,704
But now, I see that I was in the wrong, sir.

175
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:20,896
Next time, I swear I'll shoot.

176
00:13:20,982 --> 00:13:23,955
I never said anything about what was right or wrong.

177
00:13:25,373 --> 00:13:27,457
My moral high ground's shot to hell.

178
00:13:27,768 --> 00:13:30,581
I have no idea who's in the right at this point.

179
00:13:34,171 --> 00:13:38,884
Now then, I think it's time we
heard what our guest has to say.

180
00:13:46,901 --> 00:13:47,974
Mercy, please!

181
00:13:48,045 --> 00:13:50,253
I'm just an old man they use to move cargo.

182
00:13:50,301 --> 00:13:51,105
I didn't want to, but they...

183
00:13:51,144 --> 00:13:52,804
I've met this one before.

184
00:13:55,684 --> 00:13:57,960
He seemed to be a prominent merchant.

185
00:14:00,867 --> 00:14:03,664
Yeah, I know him. Dimo Reeves, right?

186
00:14:05,499 --> 00:14:08,614
This damn job was forced on us by the Military Police.

187
00:14:08,741 --> 00:14:10,774
And now that we completely botched it,

188
00:14:10,854 --> 00:14:13,850
they'll plunder the Reeves
Company for everything its worth.

189
00:14:13,952 --> 00:14:15,271
First, they'll kill me,

190
00:14:15,358 --> 00:14:19,482
and then they'll set up "accidents"
for all my employees. My dumb son, too.

191
00:14:20,865 --> 00:14:22,876
You just gonna lay down and take it?

192
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:27,069
There's a reason Trost recovered from that Titan attack.

193
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,282
It's largely because of jobs and
money brought in by the Reeves Company.

194
00:14:31,498 --> 00:14:36,311
Tell me, if your company were to disappear,
how many would survive the coming winter?

195
00:14:37,414 --> 00:14:39,852
So, what? You want me to join you?

196
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:42,855
We just need to know where Eren and Historia are.

197
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:46,828
If you're in contact with the MPs, I think I have a plan.

198
00:14:47,312 --> 00:14:51,413
And can you give me your word that the
people of Trost won't end up starving to death?

199
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:54,446
I can't guarantee it. That said,

200
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:57,601
I believe they'll have a better
chance with us than without.

201
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,216
About time the bastards left.

202
00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:11,513
Our situation just got worse!

203
00:15:11,735 --> 00:15:13,697
I have two things to report, Commander.

204
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:17,050
First, Eren and Historia have been abducted by the enemy.

205
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,223
Three from my squad were killed in the fighting.

206
00:15:20,417 --> 00:15:24,804
I'm about to meet Captain Levi and follow up on a
lead he might have as to their current whereabouts.

207
00:15:25,162 --> 00:15:26,440
Understood. What else?

208
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:30,082
Eren remembered a conversation he
overheard between Ymir and Bertholdt.

209
00:15:30,367 --> 00:15:32,368
But, if this is actually true, then...

210
00:15:32,543 --> 00:15:35,379
Shit. I feel like my head's gonna explode.

211
00:15:35,404 --> 00:15:36,580
Are you okay?

212
00:15:36,766 --> 00:15:37,929
What's the problem?

213
00:15:41,976 --> 00:15:45,183
Unless we recover him quickly, Eren will be devoured.

214
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:53,128
Hey! How'd you find 'em anyway?

215
00:15:53,647 --> 00:15:56,909
They found me. I promised them that I'd cooperate,

216
00:15:57,179 --> 00:15:59,182
and for some reason they believed me.

217
00:16:01,641 --> 00:16:02,702
Are we there?

218
00:16:10,915 --> 00:16:12,593
Reeves, you piece of...

219
00:16:14,776 --> 00:16:17,352
Sorry, gents. That's how it is.

220
00:16:24,121 --> 00:16:25,305
What happens now?

221
00:16:25,614 --> 00:16:28,053
Do you think this means we'll be safe? Or what?

222
00:16:28,172 --> 00:16:29,539
There's no guarantee.

223
00:16:29,657 --> 00:16:32,162
Say what? Then why'd we do it?

224
00:16:32,685 --> 00:16:35,315
A good merchant has to learn to trust his nose.

225
00:16:35,688 --> 00:16:37,706
And not just to smell easy money,

226
00:16:37,856 --> 00:16:40,765
but to sniff out the potential for future profit, too.

227
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:43,967
Once you have, you bite and you don't let go.

228
00:16:44,274 --> 00:16:45,778
You remember that, son.

229
00:16:47,026 --> 00:16:49,649
I made it! You haven't finished yet, have you?

230
00:16:49,903 --> 00:16:52,565
No. Haven't even gotten my feet wet.

231
00:16:52,635 --> 00:16:55,289
Sannes! I'm only a novice at human torture,

232
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:58,937
but while I lack experience,
I plan to give this job my all.

233
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,368
Hold on! At least tell me what you want!

234
00:17:01,447 --> 00:17:03,958
Who the hell tortures someone without asking questions?

235
00:17:03,998 --> 00:17:07,159
Oh, yeah. We do have some questions.

236
00:17:07,461 --> 00:17:09,645
Where were Eren and Historia taken?

237
00:17:10,137 --> 00:17:13,610
What do you want with Historia,
and what is the Reiss family?

238
00:17:13,674 --> 00:17:14,658
Come on!

239
00:17:15,044 --> 00:17:17,806
Can't you see that we're in a time crunch here?

240
00:17:19,784 --> 00:17:21,181
Here we go again.

241
00:17:21,643 --> 00:17:24,741
The screams seem a lot louder than
they were when the captain did it.

242
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:27,903
I know it's to save our friends, but...

243
00:17:28,446 --> 00:17:30,032
...it still makes me sick.

244
00:17:31,294 --> 00:17:34,186
Let's face the facts. We're criminals now.

245
00:17:36,482 --> 00:17:38,707
Our last enemy wanted to eat us.

246
00:17:38,921 --> 00:17:41,759
We don't have an excuse like
that for killing these people.

247
00:17:42,148 --> 00:17:44,262
It's just that their views are different.

248
00:17:45,016 --> 00:17:48,155
No. It's just that they're in another group.

249
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,721
And for that, we'll take their lives.

250
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:52,896
Armin.

251
00:17:54,471 --> 00:17:57,704
We're not good people. Not anymore, at least.

252
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:03,504
Sorry. I don't have your knack for peeling nails.

253
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:07,343
Just how many did you have to
rip off to get so good at it?

254
00:18:07,811 --> 00:18:09,693
More than I could keep track of.

255
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:12,171
Within these cramped, squalid walls,

256
00:18:12,369 --> 00:18:15,707
war has never broken out, and I can tell you why.

257
00:18:16,389 --> 00:18:21,420
It's because we of the First Interior Squad
dirtied our hands to protect the king's peace!

258
00:18:22,174 --> 00:18:24,700
A teacher too smart for his own good.

259
00:18:25,033 --> 00:18:27,043
A stupid couple who tried to fly.

260
00:18:27,537 --> 00:18:30,039
A whore who screwed the wrong man!

261
00:18:30,285 --> 00:18:33,877
No matter how they'd beg or plead,
we erased them to protect humanity!

262
00:18:34,028 --> 00:18:36,031
You should be on your knees thanking me!

263
00:18:36,183 --> 00:18:40,545
In all my years, I've never seen anyone
take such pleasure from human suffering as you!

264
00:18:40,798 --> 00:18:42,275
You're both monsters!

265
00:18:42,656 --> 00:18:44,998
But I'm determined to face you without fear.

266
00:18:45,144 --> 00:18:49,672
Do what you will. For I... I have my faith.

267
00:18:50,482 --> 00:18:54,644
And I believe in the king and in peace within these walls.

268
00:18:54,669 --> 00:18:59,786
I believe that every last one of my
wretched deeds was justified, but...

269
00:19:01,096 --> 00:19:03,584
To think that it hurt this much...

270
00:19:05,737 --> 00:19:08,414
If you're going to torture me to death, get on with it.

271
00:19:08,641 --> 00:19:12,315
That sounds like a fitting
end for this blood-stained life.

272
00:19:14,693 --> 00:19:16,152
Time for a break.

273
00:19:19,582 --> 00:19:20,903
Ugh. Damn it all.

274
00:19:21,224 --> 00:19:23,071
I'm starting to feel sorry for him.

275
00:19:28,755 --> 00:19:30,754
Quit shovin' me. It hurts.

276
00:19:30,779 --> 00:19:31,368
Ralph!

277
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,704
How pathetic can you get?

278
00:19:34,942 --> 00:19:38,072
Can't believe you started talking after just one nail.

279
00:19:39,027 --> 00:19:41,164
Sannes doesn't have any nails left.

280
00:19:41,386 --> 00:19:42,641
He's a real soldier.

281
00:19:43,086 --> 00:19:46,074
Like I care. He can get tortured all he wants.

282
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,727
The guy never shuts up about peace and the king.

283
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:51,057
The rest of us all hate his damn guts.

284
00:19:51,241 --> 00:19:53,725
Just do us a favor and kill him already.

285
00:19:55,354 --> 00:19:59,024
We're gonna have to keep him around
until he's verified what you told us.

286
00:19:59,111 --> 00:20:03,210
Yeah? Well, you got everything you wanted
out of me, so why don't you lay off already?

287
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,689
Oh, and about my cell. It'll have a bed, right?

288
00:20:22,864 --> 00:20:25,170
Ready, Sannes? We're gonna try it again!

289
00:20:25,274 --> 00:20:28,159
This isn't easy for me either, but
I'll be the best torturer I can...

290
00:20:28,222 --> 00:20:30,541
Reiss is the true royal family.

291
00:20:39,998 --> 00:20:42,577
So much for keepin' a low profile.

292
00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:45,079
How long is that boy gonna take?

293
00:20:56,865 --> 00:21:00,947
Ya know, the one thing a merchant
should never sell out of is trust.

294
00:21:06,309 --> 00:21:09,480
Was it wise to do that without asking where Levi is?

295
00:21:09,773 --> 00:21:11,888
He'll show up no matter what we do.

296
00:21:12,428 --> 00:21:13,579
How do you know that?

297
00:21:14,123 --> 00:21:15,855
'Cause I raised him, that's how.

298
00:21:16,464 --> 00:21:19,420
Levi Ackermann's not one to give up the chase.

299
00:21:27,665 --> 00:21:30,192
You mean the rightful heir to the throne is...

300
00:21:30,486 --> 00:21:31,670
...Historia?

301
00:21:32,448 --> 00:21:34,903
That's correct. And based on that knowledge,

302
00:21:34,974 --> 00:21:38,105
we're assuming that she and
Eren have been taken to Lord Reiss.

303
00:21:44,201 --> 00:21:45,286
That's him.

304
00:21:50,675 --> 00:21:51,777
Historia.

305
00:21:55,544 --> 00:21:57,887
I can't tell you how sorry I am.

306
00:23:40,476 --> 00:23:42,507
One girl's tortured past

307
00:23:42,801 --> 00:23:46,214
holds a secret that could change the fate of a kingdom.

308
00:23:46,833 --> 00:23:48,920
Once this secret is known to Erwin,

309
00:23:49,182 --> 00:23:51,142
he remembers his own past.

310
00:23:52,103 --> 00:23:54,753
Next episode: "Old Story."
