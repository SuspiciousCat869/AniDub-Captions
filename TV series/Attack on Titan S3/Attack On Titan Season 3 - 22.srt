1
00:00:03,294 --> 00:00:06,008
Each of the Nine Titans has a name to describe it,

2
00:00:06,479 --> 00:00:09,558
and that includes the one you're about to inherit from me.

3
00:00:11,746 --> 00:00:12,886
Throughout history,

4
00:00:13,305 --> 00:00:15,636
this Titan's marched in the vanguard.

5
00:00:16,396 --> 00:00:19,036
It has ever pushed forward, seeking freedom.

6
00:00:19,902 --> 00:00:22,984
And for freedom's sake, it fights.

7
00:00:25,129 --> 00:00:26,050
Therefore...

8
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:28,711
...it's called the Attack Titan.

9
00:00:33,297 --> 00:00:38,238
Eren has commanded Pure Titans once in
the past, to escape from a dire situation.

10
00:00:41,394 --> 00:00:44,609
If someone with royal blood is turned into a Titan,

11
00:00:45,301 --> 00:00:50,115
then it might be possible for me to use the
Founding Titan's powers while touching them.

12
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,364
But if the military knew it was a possibility,

13
00:00:53,826 --> 00:00:55,715
what would they do to Historia?

14
00:00:58,265 --> 00:00:59,425
Build a family.

15
00:01:00,243 --> 00:01:00,752
Huh?

16
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:04,437
Be it your wife, your child, or even a stranger.

17
00:01:04,935 --> 00:01:06,907
Love someone in those walls.

18
00:01:09,028 --> 00:01:11,760
If you can't do that, it'll only repeat itself.

19
00:01:12,044 --> 00:01:13,436
This cruel history.

20
00:01:13,568 --> 00:01:15,007
These foolish mistakes.

21
00:01:15,228 --> 00:01:16,112
They'll repeat.

22
00:01:17,027 --> 00:01:18,497
You have to see this through.

23
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,945
Complete your mission and save Mikasa and Armin.

24
00:01:22,592 --> 00:01:25,536
Mikasa? Armin? Who are they?

25
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:29,788
I-I don't know.

26
00:01:30,544 --> 00:01:32,123
They aren't from my memories.

27
00:03:18,377 --> 00:03:20,731
Our foe is the world.

28
00:03:21,377 --> 00:03:23,852
That information should stay in this room.

29
00:03:24,085 --> 00:03:26,441
If it became public knowledge, there'd be chaos.

30
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:27,960
Yes, I concur.

31
00:03:28,044 --> 00:03:32,129
Regrettably, we can't let this get
out till we fully grasp the situation.

32
00:03:32,443 --> 00:03:34,625
Shall we deceive the people once more?

33
00:03:35,669 --> 00:03:37,399
That's what you're suggesting, right?

34
00:03:37,694 --> 00:03:41,784
That we keep our citizens complacent
and blind, as the late King did?

35
00:03:43,627 --> 00:03:44,820
If we do that,

36
00:03:45,376 --> 00:03:48,036
then by what ideals did we oppose King Reiss?

37
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:50,403
What right did we have to seize his crown?

38
00:03:54,294 --> 00:03:55,560
Then let's announce it.

39
00:03:56,978 --> 00:03:58,145
It's only fair.

40
00:03:58,211 --> 00:04:00,756
This is information that the people once knew,

41
00:04:01,153 --> 00:04:03,440
before my predecessor stole it from them.

42
00:04:04,585 --> 00:04:08,328
As the people of the walls, all
of us will share the same fate.

43
00:04:08,861 --> 00:04:13,047
Which is why we must now unite as one and work together.

44
00:04:20,027 --> 00:04:22,469
The monstrous Titans that have menaced us so,

45
00:04:22,544 --> 00:04:24,352
are in fact, human.

46
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:27,460
They're known as Subjects of Ymir, or Eldians,

47
00:04:27,488 --> 00:04:29,398
and we share a common ancestry.

48
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,918
When our King erected these walls 100 years ago,

49
00:04:33,228 --> 00:04:35,739
he altered our memories using Titan powers,

50
00:04:36,214 --> 00:04:38,606
so as to make us think that beyond the walls,

51
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,481
humanity had gone extinct.

52
00:04:41,221 --> 00:04:44,374
In truth, there are countless people beyond the walls.

53
00:04:44,653 --> 00:04:46,812
But when it comes to us Subjects of Ymir,

54
00:04:47,085 --> 00:04:50,165
they believe that we are a race of devils.

55
00:04:52,335 --> 00:04:53,472
In the near future,

56
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:57,653
the enemy will invade our lands in
order to obtain the resources beneath us.

57
00:04:58,294 --> 00:05:00,294
Their plans began five years ago,

58
00:05:00,384 --> 00:05:03,141
when they used the Colossal Titan to breach Shiganshina.

59
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,106
I know the article's already published,

60
00:05:08,487 --> 00:05:10,975
but is all of this as credible as you claim?

61
00:05:11,502 --> 00:05:12,794
At the very least,

62
00:05:13,002 --> 00:05:16,552
it addresses most of the doubts and
questions that we've had this whole time.

63
00:05:17,778 --> 00:05:19,878
I know it's not the truth we would hope for,

64
00:05:20,057 --> 00:05:21,372
but it's what we have.

65
00:05:23,877 --> 00:05:24,965
'Preciate it.

66
00:05:25,179 --> 00:05:27,929
So how are people taking the news?

67
00:05:28,108 --> 00:05:29,493
It's a mixed bag.

68
00:05:30,244 --> 00:05:31,661
Some just accept it.

69
00:05:31,752 --> 00:05:32,979
Some laugh it off.

70
00:05:33,169 --> 00:05:37,676
Some lash out at the military and
insist it's all a great conspiracy.

71
00:05:38,767 --> 00:05:40,059
Just as you feared,

72
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:42,317
things have become somewhat chaotic.

73
00:05:42,377 --> 00:05:45,097
Makes sense, but there's really no helping that.

74
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:47,952
It's our job to explore and report our findings.

75
00:05:48,217 --> 00:05:51,025
The taxpayers can treat that information as they will.

76
00:05:54,533 --> 00:05:57,556
That's something we've improved
since the King was deposed.

77
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,742
I couldn't be prouder of the work you've done.

78
00:06:01,203 --> 00:06:01,712
Huh?

79
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:05,461
Not only as a citizen of the walls, but...

80
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:07,987
...one working stiff to another.

81
00:06:08,377 --> 00:06:10,766
Uh... thank you.

82
00:06:10,835 --> 00:06:15,368
Uh-huh. Then why don't you fluff us
up a bit in the next article you write?

83
00:06:19,669 --> 00:06:22,429
I have to ask, what happens to us now?

84
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:27,642
We've looked at the Titans with fear, with hate,

85
00:06:28,068 --> 00:06:31,470
with the wish in our hearts
that they would disappear forever.

86
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:36,636
And now we've learned that this is
how the people of the world look at us.

87
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,717
We're not human to them.

88
00:06:38,962 --> 00:06:40,066
We're monsters.

89
00:06:41,502 --> 00:06:44,817
They'll attack us, just as they did before.

90
00:06:45,403 --> 00:06:46,549
Why wouldn't they?

91
00:06:50,894 --> 00:06:52,953
This hell will repeat itself

92
00:06:53,585 --> 00:06:56,704
until the last of us are dead.

93
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,883
Well, if it isn't the brave heroes of the walls.

94
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:12,173
Hitch. Surprised you came.

95
00:07:13,169 --> 00:07:15,772
I just wanted to watch you guys get your medals.

96
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:17,306
I see.

97
00:07:21,252 --> 00:07:22,159
Marlo was...

98
00:07:23,995 --> 00:07:26,140
...very brave, right to the end.

99
00:07:28,169 --> 00:07:28,937
I know.

100
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,202
Isn't that right, Floch?

101
00:07:32,321 --> 00:07:33,290
You should tell her.

102
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:35,062
Yeah, sure.

103
00:07:38,169 --> 00:07:39,789
I rode right beside Marlo.

104
00:07:40,002 --> 00:07:42,593
Just like me, he joined as an urgent recruit.

105
00:07:43,515 --> 00:07:46,113
But unlike me, he was brave, and a natural leader.

106
00:07:47,835 --> 00:07:49,553
Our situation was hopeless.

107
00:07:50,252 --> 00:07:53,051
It seemed to us that the Scouts were on the verge of ruin.

108
00:07:54,085 --> 00:07:57,136
Just as our fear was giving way to panic and despair,

109
00:07:57,752 --> 00:08:00,939
he stepped in and inspired us to push on.

110
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:03,341
Yeah?

111
00:08:04,585 --> 00:08:06,243
He was an amazing person.

112
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:08,608
I know. And that's why...

113
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:13,304
Well, it's probably why he never listened to me.

114
00:08:16,264 --> 00:08:17,187
But in the end,

115
00:08:18,252 --> 00:08:20,556
I'm sure he wished that he'd never volunteered.

116
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:28,160
Thanks for that.

117
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:30,989
I'll laugh if you guys screw up the ceremony.

118
00:08:33,335 --> 00:08:35,405
Hey! Why did you tell her that?

119
00:08:37,335 --> 00:08:38,131
Because.

120
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:41,738
Somebody has to speak the truth around here.

121
00:08:50,794 --> 00:08:51,374
Listen.

122
00:08:51,835 --> 00:08:56,507
I heard about what you did, Floch... how hard
you fought to ensure that Erwin would be revived.

123
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:57,745
That's right.

124
00:08:58,419 --> 00:08:59,557
You should be dead,

125
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,686
and Erwin should stand in your place.

126
00:09:02,579 --> 00:09:04,244
I'm not alone in thinking that.

127
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:05,998
All of us do.

128
00:09:06,741 --> 00:09:09,312
Everyone who read that report had the same thought.

129
00:09:10,108 --> 00:09:12,451
Why wasn't Erwin the one that was saved?

130
00:09:17,886 --> 00:09:20,697
What do you know about Armin to justify saying that?

131
00:09:20,776 --> 00:09:21,752
Not a damn thing!

132
00:09:21,835 --> 00:09:22,919
Yeah, you're right.

133
00:09:23,002 --> 00:09:25,044
I'm not a childhood friend of his.

134
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:26,729
Hell, I'm not his friend at all.

135
00:09:27,335 --> 00:09:30,304
But I can still tell you why
he's the one standing here now.

136
00:09:30,927 --> 00:09:34,387
It's 'cause you two got emotional
and Captain Levi did the same.

137
00:09:35,044 --> 00:09:36,852
You made an irrational choice.

138
00:09:36,877 --> 00:09:39,671
You treated that syringe like it was yours and wasted it!

139
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:43,960
He's alive because you think your friends
are more important than the rest of us.

140
00:09:47,195 --> 00:09:50,626
All right. I think it's time you shut your mouth.

141
00:09:52,585 --> 00:09:53,231
Eren.

142
00:09:53,753 --> 00:09:55,378
I bet even at your core,

143
00:09:55,502 --> 00:09:58,110
you're always completely certain that you're in the right.

144
00:09:58,451 --> 00:09:59,875
That's why you wouldn't give up.

145
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:02,601
You're like a little kid who won't listen to reason.

146
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:08,439
Eren. Just leave him be, all right?

147
00:10:09,294 --> 00:10:12,000
At least Mikasa acted like an adult out there.

148
00:10:12,755 --> 00:10:14,907
I saw her give up in the end.

149
00:10:19,305 --> 00:10:21,858
Jeez! What the hell's wrong with you two?

150
00:10:22,294 --> 00:10:27,122
Hey, Floch. Let's not do this during
a memorial for our fallen comrades.

151
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:30,427
What's done is done, so there's
no sense in dredging it up again.

152
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:31,945
As for you two.

153
00:10:32,294 --> 00:10:34,749
You might not have acted against your superiors,

154
00:10:34,877 --> 00:10:37,631
but you didn't try to stop Eren and Mikasa either.

155
00:10:37,794 --> 00:10:39,705
You didn't do anything but watch.

156
00:10:40,878 --> 00:10:42,794
Medals? For what?

157
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:44,503
A memorial for who?

158
00:10:45,085 --> 00:10:49,240
When you guys start rebuilding the Survey
Corps, you'd better tell your recruits the truth,

159
00:10:50,196 --> 00:10:53,505
or else you'll just end up
with cowards like me in the ranks.

160
00:10:54,002 --> 00:10:57,104
What the hell are we supposed
to do now that we've lost Erwin?

161
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:59,939
I know that I'm just fodder.

162
00:11:00,585 --> 00:11:03,314
I understand that my life is expendable, but still.

163
00:11:04,065 --> 00:11:05,906
I should get to call it like I see it...

164
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,854
...and to decide if this cause is worth dying for.

165
00:11:16,294 --> 00:11:17,734
I think Floch is right.

166
00:11:19,419 --> 00:11:22,000
Commander Erwin's the one who should've been saved.

167
00:11:22,752 --> 00:11:24,994
Maybe he could've turned this situation around.

168
00:11:25,544 --> 00:11:26,488
I can't though.

169
00:11:31,669 --> 00:11:33,813
How can you be so sure of that?

170
00:11:39,877 --> 00:11:41,735
I don't know what choice was right,

171
00:11:42,394 --> 00:11:44,015
so I won't pretend to.

172
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,835
None of us know what the future might hold.

173
00:11:47,544 --> 00:11:50,466
I mean, we can barely imagine.

174
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:51,833
Think about it.

175
00:11:52,741 --> 00:11:56,363
If we rode straight from Wall Maria, what would we find?

176
00:11:59,377 --> 00:12:00,097
The sea.

177
00:12:00,725 --> 00:12:03,011
Yeah, that's right. We'd find the sea.

178
00:12:03,502 --> 00:12:05,276
A place we've only dreamed about.

179
00:12:05,752 --> 00:12:08,486
Water that glows like fire, fields of ice,

180
00:12:08,669 --> 00:12:11,179
giant rocks that take days to climb!

181
00:12:11,395 --> 00:12:13,186
How can we be sure of anything

182
00:12:13,294 --> 00:12:15,755
when there's so much we haven't seen yet?

183
00:12:16,759 --> 00:12:18,402
On the other side of the wall,

184
00:12:18,817 --> 00:12:20,070
freedom is...

185
00:12:27,252 --> 00:12:28,516
All right, you brats.

186
00:12:28,967 --> 00:12:30,787
It's time. Line up.

187
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:00,154
What did we find in that cellar?

188
00:13:02,027 --> 00:13:03,076
Was it hope?

189
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:07,058
Or was it just despair?

190
00:13:08,517 --> 00:13:11,140
Our enemy is tremendously powerful.

191
00:13:11,752 --> 00:13:14,158
If nothing changes for the better soon,

192
00:13:14,511 --> 00:13:17,299
that calamity will only repeat itself.

193
00:13:18,377 --> 00:13:20,930
I'd give up my life in a heartbeat

194
00:13:21,319 --> 00:13:23,639
if I was certain that in doing so,

195
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:25,712
I could make a difference.

196
00:13:29,627 --> 00:13:30,194
But...

197
00:13:31,169 --> 00:13:34,064
...I'm not about to sacrifice Historia's.

198
00:13:36,419 --> 00:13:41,882
I can't tell anyone about this, so what should I do?

199
00:13:47,921 --> 00:13:50,311
I'm an Eldian who came from beyond the walls!

200
00:13:52,252 --> 00:13:54,934
I'm a Subject of Ymir just like all of you!

201
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:58,438
King of the walls! I beg you!

202
00:13:58,631 --> 00:14:01,123
Kill the Titans attacking Wall Maria.

203
00:14:01,294 --> 00:14:03,579
Please, before my wife and children are...

204
00:14:03,778 --> 00:14:07,090
before thousands of your people are eaten alive!

205
00:14:23,085 --> 00:14:23,718
Eren?

206
00:14:41,627 --> 00:14:43,787
Hange's "executioner from hell,"

207
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:46,186
which had been crushing Titans day and night,

208
00:14:46,725 --> 00:14:49,523
went silent just as the snow began to stick.

209
00:14:54,127 --> 00:14:57,009
Months later, when the snow started melting,

210
00:14:57,578 --> 00:15:00,455
the military formally announced that Wall Maria

211
00:15:00,754 --> 00:15:03,189
had been cleansed of Titans at last.

212
00:15:05,252 --> 00:15:08,782
By the time the elevators on
Trost's walls were freed for use,

213
00:15:09,211 --> 00:15:11,706
and work had begun on paving the main road,

214
00:15:12,261 --> 00:15:13,723
there were flowers in bloom,

215
00:15:14,203 --> 00:15:16,217
and butterflies dancing between them.

216
00:15:18,176 --> 00:15:22,225
Maria's refugees were finally
permitted to return to their homes

217
00:15:23,246 --> 00:15:27,714
roughly a year after what had been
called "humanity's first victory" in Trost.

218
00:15:33,616 --> 00:15:38,870
And so, six years after the Colossal
Titan's first devastating attack...

219
00:15:41,693 --> 00:15:44,382
...the Scouts resumed their expeditions,

220
00:15:44,644 --> 00:15:47,560
exploring the world beyond the walls once again.

221
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,588
It's just as you thought, Hange.

222
00:15:52,438 --> 00:15:55,346
Most of the Titans had already gone inside Wall Maria.

223
00:15:55,877 --> 00:15:57,356
We've all but wiped them out,

224
00:15:57,381 --> 00:15:59,184
and it only took us a single year.

225
00:16:00,336 --> 00:16:02,210
Then let's push straight forward,

226
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,789
exactly as we'd planned.

227
00:16:34,309 --> 00:16:35,048
A Titan!

228
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:37,582
So one actually showed up? Let's take a look!

229
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,334
It's over there.

230
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:45,844
Huh?

231
00:16:49,502 --> 00:16:51,563
Doesn't look like it can move much.

232
00:16:52,748 --> 00:16:54,200
Even with those limbs,

233
00:16:54,599 --> 00:16:57,887
it still tried to drag itself to the wall, bit by bit.

234
00:17:09,926 --> 00:17:11,394
Hey! Careful!

235
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,677
It was shipped to paradise,

236
00:17:16,396 --> 00:17:18,306
which means it's a fellow patriot.

237
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:25,019
Let's go.

238
00:17:25,394 --> 00:17:26,466
We're close.

239
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:34,261
Just hang on.

240
00:17:35,044 --> 00:17:36,699
Is it okay to leave this here?

241
00:17:37,085 --> 00:17:38,399
Shouldn't somebody kill it?

242
00:17:39,739 --> 00:17:40,576
Shit!

243
00:18:16,664 --> 00:18:17,863
I'm sure of it.

244
00:18:18,752 --> 00:18:22,286
This is the place where they'd turn the Eldians Titan.

245
00:18:23,767 --> 00:18:26,292
Which means, just up there...

246
00:19:40,127 --> 00:19:41,618
Ow!

247
00:19:41,716 --> 00:19:43,334
My eyes! They burn!

248
00:19:43,429 --> 00:19:44,733
That's salty!

249
00:19:45,004 --> 00:19:46,810
Woo, hoo, hoo!

250
00:19:46,874 --> 00:19:49,451
Wow. Is this actually full of salt water?

251
00:19:49,627 --> 00:19:51,422
Huh? What could that be?

252
00:19:51,544 --> 00:19:52,676
Hey, Hange!

253
00:19:52,835 --> 00:19:54,932
You shouldn't touch it, it might be poisonous.

254
00:20:14,419 --> 00:20:15,489
You see, Eren?

255
00:20:16,335 --> 00:20:17,919
It's just like I told you.

256
00:20:19,349 --> 00:20:23,267
A body of water so big that
merchants could spend their whole lives

257
00:20:23,374 --> 00:20:25,275
and still not get all the salt out.

258
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,539
That's what I said we'd find,

259
00:20:27,877 --> 00:20:29,739
and now it looks like I was right.

260
00:20:32,585 --> 00:20:33,409
Yeah.

261
00:20:34,136 --> 00:20:35,014
The sea.

262
00:20:35,749 --> 00:20:37,508
It's so damn big.

263
00:20:39,127 --> 00:20:39,727
Yeah.

264
00:20:41,142 --> 00:20:43,165
Hey. It's like you said, too!

265
00:20:43,377 --> 00:20:44,377
On the other side of the wall...

266
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:45,517
There's a sea.

267
00:20:48,989 --> 00:20:50,571
And just across that sea,

268
00:20:51,252 --> 00:20:52,430
freedom's waiting.

269
00:20:54,627 --> 00:20:56,928
That's what I always believed, at least.

270
00:21:02,849 --> 00:21:04,181
But I was wrong.

271
00:21:04,752 --> 00:21:07,391
I know what's waiting across this sea now.

272
00:21:08,252 --> 00:21:09,773
It's our enemies.

273
00:21:11,627 --> 00:21:13,126
Everything we've seen

274
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:16,495
has been exactly as it was in my father's memories.

275
00:21:25,304 --> 00:21:25,987
Hey.

276
00:21:28,544 --> 00:21:32,637
If we did cross the sea, and we killed our enemies...

277
00:21:33,752 --> 00:21:37,079
After that, would we finally be free?
