1
00:00:23,766 --> 00:00:25,415
I should've realized.

2
00:00:25,652 --> 00:00:27,261
Of course this would happen.

3
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:31,995
Still... trusting your plan was the only choice I had.

4
00:00:33,994 --> 00:00:34,927
But why?

5
00:00:36,762 --> 00:00:37,548
Armin...

6
00:00:37,936 --> 00:00:39,446
Why don't you ever run?

7
00:00:47,639 --> 00:00:48,589
A Titan?

8
00:00:54,819 --> 00:00:55,900
Damn it!

9
00:00:58,022 --> 00:00:59,872
Just try and come closer!

10
00:01:00,276 --> 00:01:03,192
Make one move to take him and I'll slit his throat!

11
00:01:05,329 --> 00:01:06,577
Hold on.

12
00:01:07,198 --> 00:01:09,777
Those markings around his eyes.

13
00:01:09,828 --> 00:01:11,368
Are they what I think?

14
00:01:11,838 --> 00:01:13,959
This must be the Beast Titan.

15
00:01:14,683 --> 00:01:15,883
I found you.

16
00:01:17,161 --> 00:01:18,503
Eren Jaeger, right?

17
00:01:19,601 --> 00:01:22,373
If nothing else, I'll take him with me!

18
00:01:22,508 --> 00:01:24,852
You don't look a thing like your father.

19
00:01:30,135 --> 00:01:31,008
What?

20
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,154
Believe me, Eren.

21
00:01:34,839 --> 00:01:37,222
I get it. I know how you feel.

22
00:01:38,049 --> 00:01:41,226
The both of us are just victims of your father.

23
00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:44,714
I'm sorry, but he's brainwashed you.

24
00:01:48,238 --> 00:01:50,305
What're you talking about?

25
00:01:53,945 --> 00:01:55,033
You're kidding.

26
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,379
He chased me all this way?

27
00:01:58,579 --> 00:02:00,032
What a monster.

28
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:07,219
Let's call it a draw, Levi.

29
00:02:07,451 --> 00:02:09,334
We're in no shape to fight now.

30
00:02:10,519 --> 00:02:11,360
Bertholdt.

31
00:02:11,739 --> 00:02:14,950
I'm sorry, but this is the end for you.

32
00:02:17,382 --> 00:02:18,034
Eren.

33
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,655
Someday, I'll come back and save you from this.

34
00:02:20,798 --> 00:02:22,076
Huh?

35
00:02:25,419 --> 00:02:26,714
He ran?

36
00:02:30,941 --> 00:02:31,959
Captain!

37
00:02:32,842 --> 00:02:34,647
I just used the last of my gas.

38
00:02:34,766 --> 00:02:37,070
Quick, give me your gear so I can chase him.

39
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:37,969
Right!

40
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:38,888
Hurry!

41
00:02:55,774 --> 00:02:56,575
Reiner.

42
00:02:57,107 --> 00:03:00,340
What's this metal case we
found in your left breast pocket?

43
00:03:00,864 --> 00:03:03,525
Before we closed in and chopped off your limbs,

44
00:03:03,627 --> 00:03:06,758
you used what strength you had left to grab at it.

45
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:08,954
So what's inside?

46
00:03:09,192 --> 00:03:11,499
Suicide pills? A bomb?

47
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:12,092
Ow!

48
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:13,172
Sorry, Jean.

49
00:03:15,594 --> 00:03:16,557
It's a letter.

50
00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:17,995
A letter?

51
00:03:19,163 --> 00:03:20,282
What does it say?

52
00:03:21,387 --> 00:03:22,506
It's for Christa.

53
00:03:22,837 --> 00:03:23,832
Ymir wrote it.

54
00:03:25,493 --> 00:03:27,027
Whatever you do with me,

55
00:03:27,204 --> 00:03:29,576
just make sure she gets to read it.

56
00:03:32,984 --> 00:03:34,972
Only after we've inspected it.

57
00:03:38,621 --> 00:03:39,628
Now then.

58
00:03:39,931 --> 00:03:42,854
I've got lots of questions that you could answer, but...

59
00:03:44,856 --> 00:03:45,897
...you're a tough one.

60
00:03:46,246 --> 00:03:48,566
If you don't wanna talk, I can't make you.

61
00:03:49,114 --> 00:03:50,187
So I'll ask.

62
00:03:50,695 --> 00:03:53,802
Will you cooperate and tell us
everything that we want to know?

63
00:03:54,835 --> 00:03:55,677
I won't.

64
00:03:56,232 --> 00:03:57,250
Thank you, Reiner.

65
00:03:57,504 --> 00:03:59,601
It helps to see that you're ready for death.

66
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:04,105
Hange, wait!

67
00:04:04,855 --> 00:04:06,697
We... need him alive.

68
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,530
So we can steal his power.

69
00:04:13,273 --> 00:04:14,426
Pay close attention.

70
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:18,627
I'm about to explain how we can
get maximum value from this syringe.

71
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,385
Using its contents,

72
00:04:21,814 --> 00:04:23,784
we can steal any Titan's powers.

73
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,193
That goes for the Colossal, Armored, and Beast Titans.

74
00:04:28,624 --> 00:04:29,465
As for how,

75
00:04:29,806 --> 00:04:32,477
we first need to defeat one of these Intelligent Titans.

76
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:35,997
Then, we'll inject one of our
comrades, turning them into a pure Titan.

77
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:39,952
They'll be in that mindless state only for a brief time.

78
00:04:40,317 --> 00:04:45,640
Once they consume the captured foe, they'll revert
into a human, but gain the power to shift forms at will.

79
00:04:47,373 --> 00:04:48,676
If this is achieved,

80
00:04:49,437 --> 00:04:52,289
then not only will we gain
knowledge and a powerful weapon,

81
00:04:53,181 --> 00:04:56,685
we'll also be able to bring one of our
soldiers back from the brink of death.

82
00:04:57,917 --> 00:04:59,759
Should you capture an enemy shifter,

83
00:05:00,418 --> 00:05:02,126
be sure to sever their limbs.

84
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:06,553
Once it's safe to do so, try to locate Captain Levi.

85
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,042
We have only this one injection.

86
00:05:12,344 --> 00:05:15,331
The captain will decide when to use it, and on whom.

87
00:05:17,987 --> 00:05:21,400
We don't know the situation with Levi on the other side.

88
00:05:21,892 --> 00:05:25,054
And we don't have the time to go and confirm it ourselves.

89
00:05:25,172 --> 00:05:28,884
These Titan powers have exceeded
our understanding too many times.

90
00:05:29,066 --> 00:05:30,877
We thought we had him before.

91
00:05:31,149 --> 00:05:34,001
I refuse to underestimate his power again.

92
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:39,333
I'll start by beheading him,
but that's not enough on its own.

93
00:05:42,918 --> 00:05:44,709
This isn't like you, Hange.

94
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:50,827
If we back down from the chance to cure our ignorance,

95
00:05:51,236 --> 00:05:54,227
then what hope do we have of
beating the Titans down the road?

96
00:05:57,326 --> 00:05:57,970
Jean.

97
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:01,704
We need to find out all that we can about the enemy,

98
00:06:02,273 --> 00:06:03,316
or we'll lose.

99
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:07,861
Mikasa.

100
00:06:08,043 --> 00:06:08,632
Yeah?

101
00:06:09,013 --> 00:06:10,747
How much gas do you have left?

102
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,883
Not enough to fight anything.

103
00:06:13,813 --> 00:06:17,563
I think I could reach Eren and Armin, but then I'd be out.

104
00:06:18,202 --> 00:06:19,858
Well that's more than I have.

105
00:06:22,242 --> 00:06:23,488
Find them, Mikasa.

106
00:06:24,016 --> 00:06:25,736
Go and evaluate the situation.

107
00:06:27,444 --> 00:06:31,394
Refill your gas, retrieve the syringe
from Levi, and bring it back to me.

108
00:06:31,902 --> 00:06:36,423
If you're unable to do so, then regardless
of the reason, fire off a smoke signal.

109
00:06:37,361 --> 00:06:39,970
That will be my cue to end Reiner.

110
00:06:40,888 --> 00:06:41,860
Understood.

111
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,802
Thank you, Hange. I...

112
00:06:48,827 --> 00:06:50,327
The decision was mine.

113
00:06:50,996 --> 00:06:52,346
You were just a factor.

114
00:06:54,485 --> 00:06:56,454
Why did I speak up for him?

115
00:06:56,851 --> 00:06:59,363
When it comes down to it, am I still...?

116
00:07:00,506 --> 00:07:02,667
Yeah! Hell yeah!

117
00:07:04,336 --> 00:07:05,527
Armin's still breathing.

118
00:07:05,552 --> 00:07:06,894
I hear him!

119
00:07:08,173 --> 00:07:09,372
Keep going!

120
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:10,707
Don't give up!

121
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:12,390
You can make it!

122
00:07:15,305 --> 00:07:16,345
That's Armin?

123
00:07:16,574 --> 00:07:19,078
Captain! Get the syringe!

124
00:07:26,811 --> 00:07:30,712
Turn Armin into a Titan, and
then we can have him eat Bertholdt!

125
00:07:30,952 --> 00:07:32,791
Hurry up and inject him!

126
00:07:36,026 --> 00:07:36,572
Right.

127
00:07:46,386 --> 00:07:47,417
Hange!

128
00:07:58,244 --> 00:07:59,267
What the hell?

129
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:09,359
They're running away with Reiner!

130
00:08:09,569 --> 00:08:10,541
What now?

131
00:08:11,876 --> 00:08:12,648
Shit!

132
00:08:12,854 --> 00:08:13,600
Conny!

133
00:08:13,736 --> 00:08:14,663
Don't chase them!

134
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:15,435
Huh?

135
00:08:18,804 --> 00:08:20,719
Chances are, you'd just get killed,

136
00:08:20,973 --> 00:08:22,538
even if you had gas left.

137
00:08:23,366 --> 00:08:25,002
Son of a bitch!

138
00:08:26,234 --> 00:08:27,624
This is all my fault.

139
00:08:27,894 --> 00:08:28,816
He'd be dead.

140
00:08:29,619 --> 00:08:32,001
He needed to die. Why'd I open my mouth?

141
00:08:32,937 --> 00:08:35,441
I told you, the decision was mine.

142
00:08:35,989 --> 00:08:37,626
Let's regroup with the others.

143
00:08:47,111 --> 00:08:47,859
Levi...

144
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:49,240
Captain...

145
00:08:49,732 --> 00:08:51,179
I finally found you.

146
00:08:52,451 --> 00:08:53,595
It's the commander.

147
00:08:53,849 --> 00:08:54,564
He's hurt!

148
00:08:55,151 --> 00:08:58,592
His stomach is gouged, and his
insides are all torn to shreds.

149
00:08:58,973 --> 00:09:00,490
The blood just won't stop!

150
00:09:01,522 --> 00:09:03,915
I thought that injection might be able to help him, but...

151
00:09:04,384 --> 00:09:05,330
...what do you think?

152
00:09:12,081 --> 00:09:12,733
Huh...?

153
00:09:20,901 --> 00:09:21,996
Captain Levi.

154
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:30,442
It's faint, but he's breathing.

155
00:09:32,308 --> 00:09:33,001
Erwin.

156
00:09:34,396 --> 00:09:35,337
You're alive.

157
00:09:47,324 --> 00:09:48,663
You know what has to happen.

158
00:09:48,712 --> 00:09:50,080
Erwin gets the shot.

159
00:09:54,775 --> 00:09:55,656
You can't.

160
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:58,277
You told me you'd use it on Armin.

161
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:03,656
I'm going to revive the person who can save humanity.

162
00:10:17,986 --> 00:10:19,071
Reiner.

163
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,503
You were incredibly lucky today.

164
00:10:32,531 --> 00:10:33,531
You two.

165
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:37,439
Do you have even the faintest damn clue...

166
00:10:38,316 --> 00:10:39,480
...what you're doing?

167
00:10:41,379 --> 00:10:42,564
It's Erwin...

168
00:10:43,528 --> 00:10:45,361
...the Commander of the Scouts...

169
00:10:46,136 --> 00:10:48,515
...and you're telling me to watch him die?

170
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:52,111
There's no time for this.

171
00:10:52,239 --> 00:10:53,759
Just get out of my way.

172
00:10:57,145 --> 00:10:59,822
Eren. Check your emotions.

173
00:11:00,657 --> 00:11:03,492
Sorry, Captain. Can't do that.

174
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:05,529
Tell me.

175
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:08,825
Why didn't you give Armin the injection right away?

176
00:11:09,194 --> 00:11:10,859
I was thinking about Erwin.

177
00:11:11,287 --> 00:11:13,823
Considering the chance that he might be alive.

178
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:17,549
But you couldn't have known that
Floch would carry the commander here.

179
00:11:18,152 --> 00:11:20,495
There's no way you would've seen that coming!

180
00:11:20,867 --> 00:11:22,163
You aren't wrong, Eren.

181
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:24,774
But the fact remains, he's here now.

182
00:11:24,992 --> 00:11:26,168
So I'll revive him.

183
00:11:38,888 --> 00:11:39,492
Hey!

184
00:11:41,802 --> 00:11:44,110
He's too exhausted to stop me.

185
00:11:44,221 --> 00:11:46,501
I could take it from him by force.

186
00:11:47,011 --> 00:11:48,886
You know just as well as I do.

187
00:11:49,522 --> 00:11:53,286
Without Erwin's leadership,
humanity can't beat the Titans!

188
00:11:53,404 --> 00:11:55,796
He's right, Mikasa. Don't be crazy!

189
00:11:55,899 --> 00:11:57,615
There's too much at stake here.

190
00:12:00,422 --> 00:12:01,112
No...

191
00:12:01,699 --> 00:12:03,400
It's the same with Armin.

192
00:12:03,646 --> 00:12:05,505
He's just as important.

193
00:12:05,711 --> 00:12:06,618
Eren!

194
00:12:07,779 --> 00:12:08,628
Think about it.

195
00:12:08,945 --> 00:12:10,360
Think about what he's done.

196
00:12:10,709 --> 00:12:13,998
We used his plan to take back Trost with that boulder.

197
00:12:14,312 --> 00:12:17,002
He's the one who realized what Annie was.

198
00:12:17,343 --> 00:12:21,205
It was his idea to avoid the
Titans by coming here at night!

199
00:12:21,566 --> 00:12:24,970
He's the only reason we uncovered Reiner's hiding spot,

200
00:12:25,335 --> 00:12:28,109
and the only reason we defeated Bertholdt!

201
00:12:28,459 --> 00:12:31,157
We only got this far because of Armin!

202
00:12:32,199 --> 00:12:35,464
I can't save humanity, and neither can the commander!

203
00:12:36,044 --> 00:12:37,784
But Armin can!

204
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,611
Tell him, Mikasa!

205
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:45,188
Please, Captain. Just let go.

206
00:12:49,729 --> 00:12:51,449
You're just being selfish.

207
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:52,997
Erwin's our leader.

208
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,063
No. Shut up!

209
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,318
What? And why the hell should I?

210
00:12:56,653 --> 00:12:59,538
Do you think you're the only ones
who've suffered through all this?

211
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:01,286
Not that you asked, but...

212
00:13:02,065 --> 00:13:03,741
...on the other side of that wall,

213
00:13:03,766 --> 00:13:05,886
there's not a single soldier left alive.

214
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:09,349
The Beast Titan threw crushed boulders at everyone.

215
00:13:10,145 --> 00:13:12,957
That field is soaked with the blood of my comrades.

216
00:13:13,999 --> 00:13:16,840
Commander Erwin was the only survivor I could find.

217
00:13:17,491 --> 00:13:18,842
He came up with a plan.

218
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:22,180
Found a way for us to strike back at the Beast Titan,

219
00:13:22,785 --> 00:13:23,913
and so we did.

220
00:13:25,352 --> 00:13:28,331
My comrades were smashed to bits just as he'd planned.

221
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:33,129
I'm sure the last thing they felt was fear.

222
00:13:34,169 --> 00:13:35,639
All-consuming fear...

223
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:45,324
When I realized the commander was still alive,

224
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,955
I almost finished him off myself.

225
00:13:50,505 --> 00:13:51,124
But then...

226
00:13:51,994 --> 00:13:53,913
...I recognized that would be a mercy.

227
00:13:55,622 --> 00:13:56,893
And I thought to myself

228
00:13:57,216 --> 00:13:59,299
that he ought to taste more of this hell.

229
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:04,939
Suddenly, I understood.

230
00:14:07,068 --> 00:14:09,778
If we wanna stand any chance against the Titans,

231
00:14:10,286 --> 00:14:11,431
we need a devil!

232
00:14:12,194 --> 00:14:14,115
I realized that's what Erwin is,

233
00:14:14,496 --> 00:14:16,745
and that it's my mission to bring him back!

234
00:14:17,651 --> 00:14:20,551
That's why a coward like me
outlived the heroes around him.

235
00:14:20,662 --> 00:14:22,482
Because Erwin needs to fight on!

236
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:24,413
So get out of his way right now!

237
00:14:24,472 --> 00:14:26,222
Don't do it!

238
00:14:29,851 --> 00:14:30,656
Hange.

239
00:14:35,289 --> 00:14:37,359
No. Don't tell me...

240
00:14:37,767 --> 00:14:38,608
No way!

241
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:41,012
It can't be.

242
00:14:43,641 --> 00:14:44,380
No.

243
00:14:45,335 --> 00:14:46,421
It isn't fair.

244
00:14:54,599 --> 00:14:57,392
I understand how you feel, but most of us are dead!

245
00:14:57,417 --> 00:14:59,497
We can't afford to lose our commander, too!

246
00:14:59,522 --> 00:15:01,055
The Scouts must endure!

247
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,971
If we lose our symbol of hope, we lose everything!

248
00:15:03,996 --> 00:15:06,563
I know that, but Armin could help us, too.

249
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,739
He's special!

250
00:15:07,778 --> 00:15:10,138
You're right. He has an amazing mind.

251
00:15:10,495 --> 00:15:12,944
That said, Erwin is far more experienced,

252
00:15:12,992 --> 00:15:14,252
and he's a leader.

253
00:15:19,869 --> 00:15:21,045
Listen, Mikasa.

254
00:15:21,243 --> 00:15:23,245
There're people I wanna bring back, too.

255
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:25,978
Hundreds at this point.

256
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:31,634
Ever since I joined up with the Scouts,

257
00:15:31,832 --> 00:15:33,789
every day brought a new farewell.

258
00:15:33,845 --> 00:15:35,126
Hange, look out!

259
00:15:51,466 --> 00:15:54,613
But... you need to understand.

260
00:15:55,206 --> 00:15:59,586
Eventually, you'll have to let
go of everyone you've ever met.

261
00:16:02,715 --> 00:16:04,487
I know that's tough to accept.

262
00:16:05,361 --> 00:16:06,696
It's tough for me, too.

263
00:16:07,539 --> 00:16:10,057
It's hard to stay sane living like that.

264
00:16:10,946 --> 00:16:11,796
It hurts.

265
00:16:12,384 --> 00:16:13,901
It really hurts.

266
00:16:15,023 --> 00:16:15,784
I know.

267
00:16:17,095 --> 00:16:20,544
But even so, all of us just have to push forward.

268
00:16:44,027 --> 00:16:44,877
Captain.

269
00:16:45,966 --> 00:16:50,909
Do you... know about... the sea?

270
00:16:51,671 --> 00:16:54,334
It's like a lake, but enormous.

271
00:16:54,421 --> 00:16:57,097
So big that it stretches past the horizon.

272
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,950
And its full of salty water.

273
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:01,761
Armin told me...

274
00:17:01,816 --> 00:17:04,056
Hey! Stop making this harder!

275
00:17:04,755 --> 00:17:07,274
He told me there's a sea beyond the walls.

276
00:17:07,671 --> 00:17:10,570
He said that we'd go there together!

277
00:17:11,356 --> 00:17:14,178
Thing is, that's been our dream since we were kids.

278
00:17:14,614 --> 00:17:16,753
Only I forgot it a long time ago!

279
00:17:17,792 --> 00:17:19,429
I want to avenge my mom.

280
00:17:19,802 --> 00:17:21,986
I wanna butcher all the Titans.

281
00:17:22,264 --> 00:17:24,792
The only thoughts left in my head are full of hate!

282
00:17:25,276 --> 00:17:28,460
Yeah. And Armin's lost as much as I have,

283
00:17:28,809 --> 00:17:30,605
but he just isn't like me.

284
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:33,303
He cares about more than fighting!

285
00:17:38,108 --> 00:17:40,198
Everyone get out of here right now!

286
00:17:40,586 --> 00:17:43,344
I don't want Erwin to eat one of you instead of Bertholdt.

287
00:17:45,861 --> 00:17:47,719
Right. C'mon, Mikasa.

288
00:17:47,961 --> 00:17:49,732
Shit. Shit!

289
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:53,776
Bye, Armin.

290
00:17:55,262 --> 00:17:56,103
We'll miss you.

291
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,720
All right, then!

292
00:18:10,117 --> 00:18:12,072
Let's start by finding the sea!

293
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:14,734
You'll see! It does exist!

294
00:18:19,469 --> 00:18:21,503
If this dream of yours comes true,

295
00:18:21,844 --> 00:18:23,036
what will you do then?

296
00:18:24,459 --> 00:18:26,398
I don't know, and I won't.

297
00:18:26,484 --> 00:18:27,589
Not until it happens.

298
00:18:28,411 --> 00:18:29,107
I just...

299
00:18:30,871 --> 00:18:32,333
...wanted to reach that cellar.

300
00:18:34,716 --> 00:18:35,938
Good grief.

301
00:18:36,756 --> 00:18:37,956
They're all the same.

302
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:41,762
Whining like brats about this dream or that.

303
00:18:42,405 --> 00:18:45,677
All of us had to spend our lives drunk on somethin'.

304
00:18:45,901 --> 00:18:48,373
Else we'd have no cause to keep pushin' on.

305
00:18:49,502 --> 00:18:52,886
Everyone was a slave to somethin'.

306
00:18:54,387 --> 00:18:55,944
There's more out there, though.

307
00:18:56,679 --> 00:18:57,890
The sea!

308
00:19:05,411 --> 00:19:06,573
Did you just...?

309
00:19:08,219 --> 00:19:09,403
Excuse me...

310
00:19:10,556 --> 00:19:13,695
...but how can we be sure that
there aren't other humans...

311
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,715
...living somewhere far away from the walls?

312
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:28,894
Give up on your dream and charge to your death.

313
00:19:29,235 --> 00:19:31,633
Lead those crying children straight to hell.

314
00:19:31,816 --> 00:19:34,677
We humans, we're all the same.

315
00:19:34,899 --> 00:19:36,513
Every last one of us.

316
00:19:37,631 --> 00:19:40,517
I'll reach the Beast Titan and tear him apart.

317
00:19:51,162 --> 00:19:51,932
Thank you.

318
00:19:53,071 --> 00:19:54,133
I needed that.

319
00:20:29,046 --> 00:20:30,506
Guys, please!

320
00:20:30,689 --> 00:20:33,738
Help me!

321
00:20:38,411 --> 00:20:41,996
Annie! Reiner!

322
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,850
I don't get it.

323
00:20:48,528 --> 00:20:50,741
Captain... why?

324
00:20:53,474 --> 00:20:57,034
Do you think... you can forgive him someday?

325
00:20:58,361 --> 00:21:00,497
He became a devil 'cause he had to.

326
00:21:02,548 --> 00:21:04,619
We were the ones who put him up to it.

327
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,448
And in the end,

328
00:21:08,021 --> 00:21:10,651
when he had finally been set free from this hell,

329
00:21:11,407 --> 00:21:13,670
we were about to bring him back for more.

330
00:21:15,139 --> 00:21:19,143
But I think... it's time we let him rest.

331
00:21:31,319 --> 00:21:32,212
Erwin.

332
00:21:32,778 --> 00:21:35,200
I told you I would kill the Beast Titan,

333
00:21:36,281 --> 00:21:37,688
but that'll have to wait.

334
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,001
He's already dead.

335
