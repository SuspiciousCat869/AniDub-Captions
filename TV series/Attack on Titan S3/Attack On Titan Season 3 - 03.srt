1
00:01:36,389 --> 00:01:39,271
I was born on a small farmstead

2
00:01:39,348 --> 00:01:41,400
in the northern lands of Wall Rose.

3
00:01:41,912 --> 00:01:44,447
It was owned by the noble Reiss family.

4
00:01:48,598 --> 00:01:50,769
As far back as I can remember,

5
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:53,072
I was helping out around the farm.

6
00:01:56,906 --> 00:01:59,380
But my mother was always reading books.

7
00:01:59,697 --> 00:02:01,106
She didn't care to work.

8
00:02:01,247 --> 00:02:02,939
And no one cared to make her.

9
00:02:03,129 --> 00:02:04,830
She was a beautiful woman.

10
00:02:07,406 --> 00:02:10,192
Most nights, someone would come for her in a carriage,

11
00:02:10,446 --> 00:02:14,348
and she'd go off into the city, wearing fancy clothes.

12
00:02:15,851 --> 00:02:18,017
For me, that was just life as I knew it.

13
00:02:21,553 --> 00:02:23,523
But when I learned to read and write,

14
00:02:24,008 --> 00:02:26,805
I started picking up books to imitate my mother.

15
00:02:27,339 --> 00:02:29,666
And they taught me just how alone I was.

16
00:02:31,891 --> 00:02:34,527
In all the stories I read in those books,

17
00:02:34,732 --> 00:02:36,855
parents cared about their children.

18
00:02:37,251 --> 00:02:40,797
They talked to them, hugged them, scolded them.

19
00:02:41,606 --> 00:02:44,355
I had never experienced any of those things.

20
00:02:46,264 --> 00:02:47,905
One day, out of curiosity,

21
00:02:47,932 --> 00:02:49,972
I decided to try hugging my mother.

22
00:02:51,784 --> 00:02:54,762
I guess I just wanted to see what kind of face she'd make.

23
00:02:56,098 --> 00:02:56,909
Mommy!

24
00:03:03,282 --> 00:03:05,567
She ended up shoving me away from her.

25
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:09,494
But that was the first time my mother had acknowledged me.

26
00:03:11,323 --> 00:03:13,377
So it actually made me happy.

27
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:20,313
If only I wasn't such a coward, I could've killed it.

28
00:03:24,181 --> 00:03:27,291
Those were the first words my mother ever said to me.

29
00:03:29,704 --> 00:03:31,920
She went to live somewhere else after that.

30
00:03:32,507 --> 00:03:34,630
I didn't see her for a long time.

31
00:03:36,598 --> 00:03:38,595
And then, five years ago,

32
00:03:38,931 --> 00:03:41,345
just a few days after Wall Maria fell...

33
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:45,016
...I finally met my father.

34
00:03:47,098 --> 00:03:49,663
Historia. My name's Rod Reiss.

35
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:51,728
I wish that we could've met sooner.

36
00:03:51,994 --> 00:03:53,563
You see, I'm your father.

37
00:03:54,973 --> 00:03:58,657
That man. He was the lord of the land I'd grown up on.

38
00:04:00,611 --> 00:04:02,890
The mother I hadn't seen in years

39
00:04:03,273 --> 00:04:05,163
looked terribly frightened.

40
00:04:06,181 --> 00:04:09,429
Now, listen. You'll be living with me from this day forth.

41
00:04:17,556 --> 00:04:19,773
You know what this is, Lord Reiss.

42
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:23,491
The fall of Wall Maria's got you acting a bit reckless.

43
00:04:23,816 --> 00:04:27,718
I suppose you thought you'd get your
pretty little secrets to safer ground, huh.

44
00:04:28,623 --> 00:04:29,773
Let Mom go!

45
00:04:29,931 --> 00:04:33,453
No! I'm not that girl's mother! I've never even met her!

46
00:04:33,739 --> 00:04:36,368
Do whatever you want with her, but let me go!

47
00:04:37,598 --> 00:04:41,174
Oh? You have anything to say about that, Lord Reiss?

48
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:44,956
Maybe it's just a coincidence the three
of you are out here at the same time.

49
00:04:52,696 --> 00:04:53,800
So be it.

50
00:04:55,675 --> 00:04:58,495
That's correct... these two have nothing to do with me.

51
00:04:58,829 --> 00:05:00,807
I thought that might be the case.

52
00:05:02,642 --> 00:05:04,334
Wait? What are you...?

53
00:05:04,473 --> 00:05:06,717
You were never employed at this estate.

54
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:09,475
And nobody here has ever heard your name.

55
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:11,842
Sounds to me like you don't exist.

56
00:05:11,905 --> 00:05:13,931
No, I... Master, please!

57
00:05:14,131 --> 00:05:16,188
That isn't true, you have to tell them!

58
00:05:16,223 --> 00:05:19,231
What are they... doing? Mother?

59
00:05:21,031 --> 00:05:25,444
If only you had never been born, I could...

60
00:05:33,056 --> 00:05:36,591
Those were the last words my mother ever said.

61
00:05:41,162 --> 00:05:42,120
No. Wait.

62
00:05:43,191 --> 00:05:45,617
Moments before I was killed myself,

63
00:05:45,861 --> 00:05:47,594
my father proposed an idea.

64
00:05:48,379 --> 00:05:50,670
That if I were sent somewhere far away,

65
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,576
to live out a quiet life,

66
00:05:53,181 --> 00:05:54,897
perhaps they could spare me.

67
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,453
Your new name will be...

68
00:05:56,889 --> 00:05:58,217
...Christa Lenz.

69
00:06:07,632 --> 00:06:09,706
I beg for your forgiveness, child.

70
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,980
Please know that everything I've done

71
00:06:12,113 --> 00:06:13,884
I did to protect you.

72
00:06:14,431 --> 00:06:16,547
F-Father.

73
00:06:17,285 --> 00:06:20,067
Not a day has passed that I haven't thought of you.

74
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,880
Long have I dreamed of a day
when I could hold you like this.

75
00:06:24,762 --> 00:06:28,805
You are special. The blood of
the king flows through your veins.

76
00:06:31,389 --> 00:06:33,095
Is that true?

77
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:35,042
Yes, Historia.

78
00:06:36,614 --> 00:06:40,032
The true royal bloodline is carried by the Reiss family.

79
00:06:40,493 --> 00:06:45,736
And as its heir, the power to save
all of humanity now rests in your hands.

80
00:06:45,848 --> 00:06:48,103
Please Historia, come with me.

81
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:50,781
And I'll show you where it all began.

82
00:06:55,322 --> 00:06:58,679
Sannes! Your face. What happened?

83
00:07:00,889 --> 00:07:05,558
Wait, did you...? They didn't
actually make you talk, did they?

84
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:08,595
But we swore a vow of loyalty to the king...

85
00:07:10,714 --> 00:07:13,376
I can't stand to hear another word out of you!

86
00:07:13,478 --> 00:07:16,904
I would've died for you, and you betrayed me for a bed!

87
00:07:19,191 --> 00:07:21,242
To think I trusted you!

88
00:07:21,723 --> 00:07:23,998
Hey. He never told us anything.

89
00:07:24,282 --> 00:07:27,057
He didn't get a chance to... we never questioned him.

90
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,712
<i>This</i> is the conversation you heard.

91
00:07:30,882 --> 00:07:33,924
We forced Ralph here to read
off this script at knifepoint.

92
00:07:34,151 --> 00:07:35,359
It was staged.

93
00:07:41,452 --> 00:07:43,979
Then... it was me.

94
00:07:44,454 --> 00:07:47,047
I'm the one who betrayed the king's secret.

95
00:07:51,662 --> 00:07:53,840
You. You're a devil.

96
00:07:56,437 --> 00:07:59,114
Yes, I think you might be right about that.

97
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:03,101
But I bet Pastor Nick felt the exact same way about you.

98
00:08:03,662 --> 00:08:06,143
That's why I felt sorry for you, Sannes.

99
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:08,458
Not because your nails got plucked out,

100
00:08:08,545 --> 00:08:10,334
but because of what you've done with your life.

101
00:08:10,428 --> 00:08:13,661
You're pathetic! A grown-ass man wailing like an infant!

102
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:16,958
Are ya sad now? Well, boo hoo!

103
00:08:16,998 --> 00:08:21,154
You get to spend the rest of your lives doing
nothing but eating and shitting in this cell!

104
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:22,679
Enjoy.

105
00:08:24,123 --> 00:08:25,555
It's your turn.

106
00:08:27,755 --> 00:08:31,703
There's an order to these things.
Perhaps it's a law of human nature.

107
00:08:32,435 --> 00:08:37,806
When one's time is over, another must
take on the role that they used to play.

108
00:08:38,931 --> 00:08:42,101
And thus, the world can never be cleansed of it.

109
00:08:44,348 --> 00:08:46,790
Best of luck, Hange.

110
00:08:50,212 --> 00:08:51,603
Section Commander?

111
00:09:00,819 --> 00:09:01,653
Uuh!

112
00:09:06,763 --> 00:09:09,463
I'm sorry. Seems I made a mess.

113
00:09:09,912 --> 00:09:12,046
I encountered a large cockroach.

114
00:09:12,284 --> 00:09:15,261
I see. Well, as hard as you kicked it,

115
00:09:15,406 --> 00:09:17,136
I bet it learned its lesson.

116
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:19,654
It's time you filled them in.

117
00:09:20,403 --> 00:09:22,888
Oh, yeah. I guess I might as well.

118
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:25,280
So they plan to eat Eren?

119
00:09:25,306 --> 00:09:29,697
Yeah. Eren remembered a conversation
between Ymir and Bertholdt.

120
00:09:30,407 --> 00:09:31,874
You hold that against me?

121
00:09:32,656 --> 00:09:33,789
I don't think so.

122
00:09:34,572 --> 00:09:36,641
I mean, I don't know.

123
00:09:37,931 --> 00:09:40,900
Suppose I have to believe you didn't want to eat anyone.

124
00:09:41,098 --> 00:09:43,187
Based on this, we can speculate.

125
00:09:43,478 --> 00:09:46,561
Ymir used to be a mindless Titan just like the others.

126
00:09:46,866 --> 00:09:48,487
Until she consumed someone.

127
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:50,894
Someone from Bertholdt and Reiner's group.

128
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:54,929
We've never seen a Titan turn back
into a human by eating one before.

129
00:09:55,194 --> 00:09:58,403
That said, Reiner's comrades aren't normal humans.

130
00:09:58,513 --> 00:10:01,929
And there's a different set of rules
for humans that can turn into Titans.

131
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:07,602
My thought is this: If a Titan eats someone with
that power, then it'll transform back into a human.

132
00:10:07,903 --> 00:10:11,074
What's more, they'll obtain
whatever powers that human had.

133
00:10:11,599 --> 00:10:16,184
In the other day's battle, Reiner was
throwing Titans at Eren as he tried to run away.

134
00:10:17,289 --> 00:10:21,213
He knew that Eren had the power to take
command of feral Titans with his scream.

135
00:10:21,577 --> 00:10:24,208
If Eren's death would've meant that power was lost,

136
00:10:24,573 --> 00:10:25,987
he wouldn't have risked it.

137
00:10:26,265 --> 00:10:29,943
I think he hoped one of those Titans
would eat Eren and take his power.

138
00:10:30,445 --> 00:10:34,575
My point is, if the government has a Titan of their own,

139
00:10:34,786 --> 00:10:36,577
they'll use it to eat Eren.

140
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:42,480
Calm down. I know you wanna get Eren back,

141
00:10:42,647 --> 00:10:44,918
but going on a rampage won't help with that.

142
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:48,263
Anyway, we're heading for Rod Reiss' estate.

143
00:10:48,906 --> 00:10:50,281
Prepare to leave at once.

144
00:10:50,787 --> 00:10:51,449
Sir!

145
00:10:55,098 --> 00:10:58,417
I'll go tell Erwin everything
we've learned about the Reiss family.

146
00:10:59,137 --> 00:11:01,301
I'm sure he's waiting to hear from us.

147
00:11:01,697 --> 00:11:02,412
Right.

148
00:11:03,014 --> 00:11:04,996
You head for Lord Reiss' estate.

149
00:11:05,152 --> 00:11:06,615
I'll find you when I can.

150
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:14,521
Pardon, sir, but the commander
of the Garrison has just arrived.

151
00:11:15,005 --> 00:11:15,815
Pyxis?

152
00:11:16,167 --> 00:11:18,319
Yes, he's asking to speak with you.

153
00:11:20,584 --> 00:11:21,464
...Very well, then.

154
00:11:21,603 --> 00:11:22,226
...Sir!

155
00:11:27,025 --> 00:11:29,511
Forgive me for dropping in unannounced.

156
00:11:30,512 --> 00:11:33,159
But I just couldn't stand still, you see.

157
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,558
I finished reading your letter.

158
00:11:35,872 --> 00:11:38,292
And I have a few thoughts of my own.

159
00:11:41,198 --> 00:11:45,115
But first, I have to ask. You are serious, right?

160
00:11:46,348 --> 00:11:50,955
Yes. I have a plan to retake Wall Maria

161
00:11:51,264 --> 00:11:52,918
and to depose the government.

162
00:12:03,103 --> 00:12:05,085
Mm. I knew this would happen someday.

163
00:12:05,439 --> 00:12:10,738
The state could only hold people in this cramped
world for so long before they began to lash out.

164
00:12:11,395 --> 00:12:13,470
And I knew that when the time came,

165
00:12:13,581 --> 00:12:17,061
I would have to point my gun
at the king I'm sworn to serve.

166
00:12:17,973 --> 00:12:20,605
Should a certain hunch of mine prove to be correct,

167
00:12:20,732 --> 00:12:24,767
it may be possible for us to carry
out this plan without military force.

168
00:12:25,073 --> 00:12:28,000
My objective, at least, is a bloodless coup.

169
00:12:28,223 --> 00:12:30,909
Ahh. Then by all means, go on.

170
00:12:31,056 --> 00:12:33,763
If such an option is plausible, I'm for it.

171
00:12:34,603 --> 00:12:38,639
Well, the catch is that the groundwork
for this has yet to be laid out.

172
00:12:39,257 --> 00:12:41,527
And if things don't go as I think they will,

173
00:12:41,842 --> 00:12:45,347
there's no plan B. I, and everyone else, will be hanged.

174
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,587
Oh. Is that all?

175
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:51,145
So this is another one of your great gambles, then.

176
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,735
Seems I may be a betting man to the end.

177
00:12:54,499 --> 00:12:56,484
I expect the news to come shortly.

178
00:12:56,922 --> 00:12:57,969
If you care to wait, I'd like you to hear

179
00:12:58,389 --> 00:13:00,791
a story from my childhood.

180
00:13:01,478 --> 00:13:02,190
Huh?

181
00:13:03,139 --> 00:13:05,755
About my father. He was a teacher.

182
00:13:17,601 --> 00:13:19,023
Damn. Too bad.

183
00:13:19,223 --> 00:13:20,382
Section Commander, that was...

184
00:13:20,501 --> 00:13:22,312
I saw it. Keep moving!

185
00:13:26,001 --> 00:13:28,881
Commander. It's done.

186
00:13:29,891 --> 00:13:31,556
Reiss is the true royal house.

187
00:13:31,694 --> 00:13:32,971
I thought as much.

188
00:13:33,514 --> 00:13:35,937
Looks like my gamble might pay off, Commander.

189
00:13:36,194 --> 00:13:36,867
Might.

190
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:39,996
One of the First Interior Squad just confessed.

191
00:13:40,246 --> 00:13:42,689
The current king is a pretender to the throne.

192
00:13:43,358 --> 00:13:45,439
Reiss is the true royal family.

193
00:13:46,281 --> 00:13:47,345
Are you sure?

194
00:13:47,989 --> 00:13:49,656
I've deployed my scouts.

195
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:51,963
They're working to retrieve Eren and Historia.

196
00:13:52,615 --> 00:13:53,830
Once they're secured, we'll declare that

197
00:13:54,171 --> 00:13:56,895
Historia Reiss is of royal blood.

198
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,995
And crown her as this country's queen.

199
00:14:02,212 --> 00:14:05,818
Knowing this is true, the ersatz king will have no choice

200
00:14:06,322 --> 00:14:08,068
but to give up the throne.

201
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:11,806
Assuming that he does, we'll have staged a bloodless coup.

202
00:14:12,348 --> 00:14:17,864
Then we'll go to the people and expose the
system that claimed to protect them for all its lies.

203
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:22,809
I'm convinced. You can count on my support.

204
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,869
That said. We could be in the wrong.

205
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:29,234
The final decision is out of our hands.

206
00:14:29,361 --> 00:14:31,744
You do understand that, don't you?

207
00:14:32,259 --> 00:14:34,173
I do. Yes.

208
00:14:40,056 --> 00:14:42,248
Anything come of the Reiss investigation?

209
00:14:42,827 --> 00:14:44,838
I found out as much as I could.

210
00:14:46,074 --> 00:14:49,175
Not much to speak of. Just one curious incident.

211
00:14:49,532 --> 00:14:50,318
Huh.

212
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:55,293
Commander Erwin! The Interior
Squad's put out a warrant for you.

213
00:14:56,545 --> 00:14:58,795
They're making a scene in the middle of the city, sir.

214
00:14:58,979 --> 00:15:00,648
Saying you had someone murdered.

215
00:15:00,861 --> 00:15:01,521
What?

216
00:15:01,676 --> 00:15:04,850
It would appear that the enemy
has been making plans of their own.

217
00:15:05,136 --> 00:15:07,092
Hange. Leave town at once.

218
00:15:07,186 --> 00:15:09,689
Huh? What are you planning to do?

219
00:15:10,112 --> 00:15:12,407
I need to be the face of the Scout Regiment.

220
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,544
I trust you to act at your own discretion.

221
00:15:16,071 --> 00:15:19,191
Also, I've chosen the Scouts' next leader.

222
00:15:19,532 --> 00:15:21,963
And it's you. Zoë Hange.

223
00:15:23,202 --> 00:15:24,855
The Scouts are in your hands.

224
00:15:30,822 --> 00:15:32,114
Hey. That's him.

225
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:33,219
Erwin's here?

226
00:15:38,841 --> 00:15:42,062
I take it you know who this is. Right, Erwin?

227
00:15:43,473 --> 00:15:45,224
That's Mr. Dimo Reeves.

228
00:15:45,622 --> 00:15:47,519
He was the head of the Reeves company.

229
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,380
Just yesterday, at this exact location,

230
00:15:50,577 --> 00:15:53,664
Eren Jaeger was abducted by a group of Reeves' lackeys.

231
00:15:53,788 --> 00:15:58,540
However, Reeves was hired to do this
by none other than the Scouts themselves,

232
00:15:58,731 --> 00:16:02,312
in the hopes that they might avoid
handing Eren Jaeger over to the government.

233
00:16:04,306 --> 00:16:07,389
And then, when Reeves had outlived his usefulness,

234
00:16:07,532 --> 00:16:09,447
they killed him to stop him from talking.

235
00:16:10,406 --> 00:16:12,179
The murderer is still at large.

236
00:16:12,365 --> 00:16:13,958
We presume they have Jaeger.

237
00:16:14,281 --> 00:16:16,592
What a convenient story that would be.

238
00:16:16,861 --> 00:16:18,951
I can see what you scoundrels are doing.

239
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:23,052
You're trying to monopolize Jaeger's
Titan power and keep it all for yourselves.

240
00:16:23,171 --> 00:16:27,071
That type of action violates
clause six of the Charter of Humanity.

241
00:16:27,364 --> 00:16:29,534
I trust that you're familiar with that law?

242
00:16:29,795 --> 00:16:35,223
One must never prioritize their own gain
over humanity's survival. Am I correct?

243
00:16:35,358 --> 00:16:36,526
That you are.

244
00:16:36,906 --> 00:16:40,283
And because the Scout Regiment
is in violation of this law,

245
00:16:40,486 --> 00:16:42,285
all Scouts must be arrested.

246
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:43,778
Dad.

247
00:16:51,523 --> 00:16:54,201
Maybe this'll satisfy the fat cats.

248
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:58,596
Reeves ended up being just as
useful against us as with us.

249
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,676
But we still don't have any leads on Levi.

250
00:17:00,795 --> 00:17:03,807
Like I told you, the runt's not gonna hide forever.

251
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:05,578
When he shows, we kill him.

252
00:17:12,105 --> 00:17:13,730
What do you think we should do?

253
00:17:16,537 --> 00:17:17,594
...Give me a moment.

254
00:17:17,618 --> 00:17:18,224
...What?

255
00:17:23,528 --> 00:17:25,592
Get the hell away from my husband!

256
00:17:28,139 --> 00:17:30,128
When the battle for Trost first began,

257
00:17:30,311 --> 00:17:32,718
Mr. Reeves delayed evacuation efforts

258
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,720
in order to preserve his wealth.

259
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:37,461
Yeah? So, what's your point?

260
00:17:37,509 --> 00:17:39,734
Are you trying to say he deserved to die?

261
00:17:39,806 --> 00:17:44,611
No, I'm not. Because upon his return to
Trost, he found it on the verge of collapse.

262
00:17:45,056 --> 00:17:47,996
And instead of abandoning it, he planted his feet.

263
00:17:48,906 --> 00:17:52,184
He helped those who couldn't leave
by striving to revive this city.

264
00:17:54,098 --> 00:17:58,301
But now, that dream has been
cut short by a knife in the dark.

265
00:17:58,639 --> 00:17:59,788
I swear this...

266
00:18:00,252 --> 00:18:01,757
...I will avenge him.

267
00:18:12,556 --> 00:18:14,970
My father. He was a teacher.

268
00:18:16,598 --> 00:18:18,440
One day, we were studying history.

269
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:21,863
"Faced with the annihilation at the hands of Titans,

270
00:18:21,981 --> 00:18:26,383
humanity took refuge behind the
walls, and realized 100 years of peace.

271
00:18:27,171 --> 00:18:32,040
But in this process, we lost all records of
what humanity's earlier past might've looked like."

272
00:18:32,697 --> 00:18:34,312
That's what all of us were taught.

273
00:18:37,054 --> 00:18:39,484
Even back then, this seemed strange to me.

274
00:18:39,853 --> 00:18:41,940
And so, I asked my father a question.

275
00:18:43,847 --> 00:18:46,158
He gave me a fairly evasive answer

276
00:18:46,466 --> 00:18:48,709
and continued with the standard lesson.

277
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,381
But, when we got home that night,

278
00:18:53,646 --> 00:18:56,178
he sat me down and gave me the real answer.

279
00:18:56,914 --> 00:19:01,659
He told me the history books he received from the
government were full of contradictions and mysteries.

280
00:19:02,986 --> 00:19:05,433
He then proceeded to tell me a theory of his.

281
00:19:05,946 --> 00:19:07,951
Even as a child, I was astounded.

282
00:19:09,714 --> 00:19:15,244
There was a reason he didn't share that theory with
the entire class, but I wasn't smart enough to see it.

283
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:20,440
I told the other children what he had told me.

284
00:19:21,069 --> 00:19:23,937
And one day, the MPs arrived to question me.

285
00:19:25,446 --> 00:19:27,496
My father didn't come home that night.

286
00:19:27,974 --> 00:19:30,641
They said he died in some kind of freak accident.

287
00:19:31,482 --> 00:19:33,145
But I knew that wasn't true.

288
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:35,678
He'd been silenced by the government.

289
00:19:37,925 --> 00:19:39,843
One hundred seven years ago,

290
00:19:40,306 --> 00:19:42,488
when humanity fled to these walls,

291
00:19:42,591 --> 00:19:46,357
the king altered their collective
memory to make them easier to rule.

292
00:19:47,095 --> 00:19:48,916
That was my father's theory.

293
00:19:49,556 --> 00:19:52,539
Yes. I can see why the first king might do that.

294
00:19:52,634 --> 00:19:55,923
He must've believed that such
knowledge would lead to civil strife.

295
00:19:56,013 --> 00:19:59,904
Yes. But ever since I was a child, I've asked myself:

296
00:20:00,274 --> 00:20:04,806
Why would the government have to kill my father
for nothing more than getting close to the truth?

297
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,768
Despite the cruelty of it,

298
00:20:07,137 --> 00:20:09,676
I'd hoped their motives at least might've been noble.

299
00:20:10,864 --> 00:20:14,547
But more recently, I've realized
something about these men.

300
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:17,511
What they're fighting to protect is not humanity.

301
00:20:18,053 --> 00:20:20,657
But their own gardens, houses, and lands.

302
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:28,086
Which means, all they care about is suppressing
those who dare to question their authority in any way.

303
00:20:28,996 --> 00:20:32,924
I no longer believe that there was
any justification for my father's death.

304
00:20:33,889 --> 00:20:35,784
He was killed by human greed.

305
00:20:36,261 --> 00:20:38,779
And by the sheer stupidity of his own son.

306
00:20:39,806 --> 00:20:44,404
I can't tell you why, but I know in
my gut that my father's words were true.

307
00:20:44,896 --> 00:20:50,466
I've made it my mission in this life to atone
to my father by showing the world he was right.

308
00:20:55,014 --> 00:20:57,545
The Scout Regiment has murdered a civilian!

309
00:20:58,223 --> 00:21:00,181
Some of them have evaded capture!

310
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:02,001
These people are dangerous!

311
00:21:02,165 --> 00:21:06,062
If you spot any of the people on
these posters, report them immediately!

312
00:21:06,189 --> 00:21:07,642
I told you, didn't I?

313
00:21:07,806 --> 00:21:10,384
These are the same bastards that unleashed a Titan here.

314
00:21:10,431 --> 00:21:12,028
They destroyed half the town.

315
00:21:12,572 --> 00:21:15,906
I bet they're planning to use that
freakshow Jaeger to wipe us all out!

316
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,618
Captain, we bought the supplies.

317
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,581
The MPs were handing out these flyers.

318
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:30,009
If this is true, the Scouts will be disbanded.

319
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:33,361
They say they'll be hunting
for us in the mountains tonight.

320
00:21:33,664 --> 00:21:36,223
They're also posting guards on all the vital roads.

321
00:21:36,309 --> 00:21:38,408
No one can get through them without a pass.

322
00:21:39,197 --> 00:21:41,077
So, Captain? What now?

323
00:21:41,306 --> 00:21:43,301
We need to hurry and find Eren.

324
00:21:43,389 --> 00:21:44,517
He'll be fine.

325
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:46,576
They're taking him on a wagon.

326
00:21:47,171 --> 00:21:50,683
That gives us one day before they reach Reiss' estate.

327
00:21:51,021 --> 00:21:54,416
And we need every second we
can get to come up with a plan.

328
00:21:54,571 --> 00:21:56,275
Captain. I hear footsteps.

329
00:21:58,889 --> 00:22:00,408
Sounds like they're approaching.

330
00:23:40,389 --> 00:23:42,412
Those who believed in justice.

331
00:23:42,598 --> 00:23:44,412
Those who protected others.

332
00:23:44,764 --> 00:23:46,587
Those who gave up their lives.

333
00:23:46,806 --> 00:23:48,968
The courage they showed in our memory

334
00:23:49,447 --> 00:23:51,960
is the same courage we use to fight.

335
00:23:52,783 --> 00:23:54,753
Next episode: "Trust."
