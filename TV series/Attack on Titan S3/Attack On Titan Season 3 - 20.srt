1
00:00:12,791 --> 00:00:16,183
The fateful day that I, just a naive youth,

2
00:00:16,716 --> 00:00:19,280
was made to face the truth of this world.

3
00:00:45,021 --> 00:00:46,318
Move it, you vermin.

4
00:00:47,368 --> 00:00:49,648
Ya can't get away from these devil-bloods.

5
00:00:49,673 --> 00:00:52,246
Damn Eldians are crawling around as they please now.

6
00:00:52,888 --> 00:00:53,779
Grisha.

7
00:00:53,924 --> 00:00:55,138
It's all right, Fay.

8
00:00:55,273 --> 00:00:56,647
We've heard worse before.

9
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:57,720
Look there!

10
00:00:58,953 --> 00:01:00,549
It should be just past that hill.

11
00:01:16,203 --> 00:01:17,908
It's so big!

12
00:01:22,983 --> 00:01:25,326
Are you kids here to look at the airship, too?

13
00:01:26,607 --> 00:01:28,490
Uh, yes, sir!

14
00:01:29,108 --> 00:01:31,144
You're from the Liberio Internment Zone?

15
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:32,868
Let's see your exit permit.

16
00:01:33,094 --> 00:01:34,981
Huh? Our permit?

17
00:01:37,774 --> 00:01:38,906
We don't have one.

18
00:01:39,857 --> 00:01:41,864
If you entered the city without permission,

19
00:01:41,955 --> 00:01:43,389
then you need to be punished.

20
00:01:44,674 --> 00:01:45,448
Yes, sir.

21
00:01:45,841 --> 00:01:47,830
Hard labor? Or a quick beating?

22
00:01:49,007 --> 00:01:50,215
A beating, please.

23
00:01:50,262 --> 00:01:51,008
Brother!

24
00:01:51,414 --> 00:01:54,210
Ah. 'Cause you don't wanna trouble your parents, right?

25
00:01:54,757 --> 00:01:55,537
That's right.

26
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:59,079
My sister didn't wanna come but I dragged her with me!

27
00:01:59,299 --> 00:02:01,495
Please allow me to take her punishment, too!

28
00:02:01,936 --> 00:02:02,908
Very well.

29
00:02:07,024 --> 00:02:07,912
Grisha!

30
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:09,454
Here's another!

31
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:11,789
Sheesh. Go easy on him, Kruger.

32
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:14,672
Come on, dear. Let's get you back home.

33
00:02:20,981 --> 00:02:23,788
It was wise of you two to leave your armbands on.

34
00:02:24,306 --> 00:02:28,142
Kids or not, Eldians who take theirs
off get a one way trip to paradise.

35
00:02:29,507 --> 00:02:31,501
Sorry. I'll go back home now.

36
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:32,408
Wait.

37
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,833
You came to see the airship, right?

38
00:02:35,174 --> 00:02:37,103
You may as well do it while you can.

39
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:45,833
The next day, my sister...

40
00:02:46,883 --> 00:02:48,646
...was found on the banks of the river.

41
00:02:49,872 --> 00:02:53,791
I showed the girl to the gates of
Liberio and then I went on my way.

42
00:02:53,816 --> 00:02:55,670
I was busy with work, you see.

43
00:02:55,932 --> 00:03:00,628
And Eldian children shouldn't be roaming
about the city without permits in the first place.

44
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:05,301
I find it disturbing that your son doesn't
know what it means to be of his bloodline.

45
00:03:05,397 --> 00:03:10,290
I mean, you have been teaching him so that he can
feel the weight of your ancestor's sins, now haven't you?

46
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,743
I couldn't prove it,

47
00:03:12,174 --> 00:03:16,081
but I knew that man from Marley Public
Security was lying through his teeth.

48
00:03:16,674 --> 00:03:19,792
We had stumbled upon him while he
was slacking off on the riverbank.

49
00:03:20,038 --> 00:03:21,506
How busy could he have been?

50
00:03:22,622 --> 00:03:25,038
Mother was silent in her grief, but father...

51
00:03:25,146 --> 00:03:27,562
Please allow me to thank you for your guidance, sir.

52
00:03:27,744 --> 00:03:31,121
I assure you, I'll heed it and
teach my foolish son to know better.

53
00:03:31,391 --> 00:03:33,234
He demeaned himself to this man.

54
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:37,674
I began to hate that Marleyan, and my father,

55
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:40,225
so much that it made my head spin.

56
00:03:40,777 --> 00:03:44,127
But more than that, I cursed my own foolishness.

57
00:03:46,597 --> 00:03:49,340
1,820 years ago,

58
00:03:49,514 --> 00:03:52,383
our ancestor Ymir Fritz made a contract

59
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:54,224
with the Devil of All Earth,

60
00:03:54,424 --> 00:03:56,895
and obtained the Power of the Titans.

61
00:03:57,049 --> 00:04:01,401
Upon her death, Ymir's spirit
was split into the Nine Titans.

62
00:04:01,466 --> 00:04:04,031
These Titans defeated the great nation of Marley,

63
00:04:04,095 --> 00:04:06,390
and conquered the continent for themselves,

64
00:04:06,445 --> 00:04:08,853
under the name of the Eldian Empire.

65
00:04:08,988 --> 00:04:11,689
Thus did this land's Dark Ages begin.

66
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,241
The subjects of Ymir

67
00:04:13,335 --> 00:04:17,609
deemed all the other races inferior to
their own, and violently oppressed them.

68
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,531
They stole wealth and land,

69
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:21,930
forced other people to bear their children,

70
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:24,442
and wiped out some bloodlines entirely.

71
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,733
This ethnic cleansing continued for around 1,700 years.

72
00:04:28,939 --> 00:04:31,506
But the fallen nation of Marley

73
00:04:31,609 --> 00:04:34,738
planned to use Eldia's arrogance
to bring it down from within.

74
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:35,819
And it worked.

75
00:04:35,938 --> 00:04:38,989
Marley brought seven of the Nine Titans under its control

76
00:04:39,216 --> 00:04:42,810
and used them to win the Great
Titan War just 80 years ago!

77
00:04:43,732 --> 00:04:47,942
The Eldian King at the time erected
three walls on the island of Paradis,

78
00:04:48,049 --> 00:04:51,271
and he fled there along with a great many of his people.

79
00:04:52,065 --> 00:04:56,317
Our ancestors were abandoned and
left behind on the mainland, but,

80
00:04:56,499 --> 00:05:00,966
despite our history, the gracious people
of Marley let us live and stay on their land.

81
00:05:01,005 --> 00:05:04,151
My father was talkative for someone
who had just lost his daughter.

82
00:05:05,424 --> 00:05:08,450
As he stood there, shaming his forebears,

83
00:05:08,537 --> 00:05:10,380
and idolizing his oppressors,

84
00:05:10,674 --> 00:05:12,588
he looked just like a whipped dog.

85
00:05:13,827 --> 00:05:15,917
That officer was telling lies.

86
00:05:17,674 --> 00:05:20,816
The truth was inconvenient for
him, so he told lies instead.

87
00:05:20,859 --> 00:05:23,836
Quiet. The walls of this house are paper thin.

88
00:05:23,861 --> 00:05:24,417
Know what?

89
00:05:24,649 --> 00:05:25,899
He prob'ly took Fay and...

90
00:05:25,924 --> 00:05:26,904
Silence!

91
00:05:28,368 --> 00:05:29,575
I told you.

92
00:05:30,446 --> 00:05:33,196
Our ancestors were heinous sinners, understand?

93
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:35,849
They committed genocide against all other races...

94
00:05:35,874 --> 00:05:38,107
Fay and I didn't do anything like that!

95
00:05:38,145 --> 00:05:39,950
We were just walking outside!

96
00:05:41,815 --> 00:05:43,274
Why are you doing this?

97
00:05:43,322 --> 00:05:44,716
What's wrong with you?

98
00:05:44,741 --> 00:05:47,323
Why are you so eager to get us all shipped away?

99
00:05:51,149 --> 00:05:53,138
We ourselves did nothing.

100
00:05:53,431 --> 00:05:57,992
But to those who've been victimized for
generations, you and I are devils nonetheless.

101
00:05:58,429 --> 00:06:00,248
We should count ourselves lucky

102
00:06:00,335 --> 00:06:03,936
that they let us live quiet, humble
lives here in the internment zone.

103
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,888
I beg you, Grisha,

104
00:06:05,913 --> 00:06:09,433
please don't force the rest of this
family to meet the same fate as Fay.

105
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,128
I still wonder which was truly in the wrong.

106
00:06:15,864 --> 00:06:17,925
The world I lived in? Or me?

107
00:06:19,091 --> 00:06:19,634
'Kay.

108
00:06:20,507 --> 00:06:21,556
I understand.

109
00:06:23,094 --> 00:06:24,305
Perhaps it was both.

110
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:27,841
I was ignorant and foolish.

111
00:06:29,402 --> 00:06:32,520
The world was twisted and maddeningly unfair.

112
00:06:35,774 --> 00:06:39,099
I discovered my own path in life when I was 18 years old.

113
00:06:39,578 --> 00:06:42,467
It was around the time I was
to take over my father's clinic.

114
00:06:45,357 --> 00:06:46,855
What's that scar on your shoulder?

115
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:50,285
This is what marks me as a patriot.

116
00:06:50,596 --> 00:06:51,922
Hm? A patriot?

117
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:56,144
Your sister was killed by a
Marleyan Public Security officer.

118
00:06:56,982 --> 00:06:58,304
That's a verified fact

119
00:06:58,382 --> 00:07:00,169
from our informant in the government.

120
00:07:01,229 --> 00:07:03,277
There are some things that you need to hear.

121
00:07:06,229 --> 00:07:07,375
It can't be!

122
00:07:08,786 --> 00:07:10,268
How could they do that?

123
00:07:11,757 --> 00:07:13,843
When I learned the truth of my sister's death,

124
00:07:14,413 --> 00:07:15,868
I swore to myself...

125
00:07:17,483 --> 00:07:20,961
...that I'd show these Marleyans who the real devils were.

126
00:07:21,757 --> 00:07:25,313
I saw that my ancestors' so-called sins were justified.

127
00:07:25,997 --> 00:07:28,452
That to set the world right as it had been,

128
00:07:29,022 --> 00:07:31,313
Eldia would have to be restored.

129
00:07:33,525 --> 00:07:36,850
Our informant within the Marleyan
Government was called "The Owl."

130
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:40,997
He led the Restorationists without ever showing himself.

131
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:43,889
Come. I've discovered the truth!

132
00:07:44,456 --> 00:07:47,783
Our ancestor Ymir awakened the Power of the Titans,

133
00:07:47,808 --> 00:07:51,199
and used it to tame the wilderness, carve out roads,

134
00:07:51,224 --> 00:07:53,377
and to make bridges to span the mountains!

135
00:07:53,479 --> 00:07:56,737
She didn't oppress other people,
she helped them to prosper!

136
00:07:57,062 --> 00:08:00,558
So the history we were taught as children
was just a hoax! Marleyan propaganda!

137
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:01,691
Impressive, Grisha.

138
00:08:01,735 --> 00:08:03,618
How'd you read this ancient language?

139
00:08:03,812 --> 00:08:07,001
Oh, no. I haven't deciphered
much of the writing at all yet.

140
00:08:07,565 --> 00:08:09,598
Then how do you know that all this is true?

141
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:12,722
Huh? Because it's obvious just from looking!

142
00:08:12,841 --> 00:08:16,091
And because I believe in our
founder Ymir with all of my heart!

143
00:08:16,265 --> 00:08:19,698
We're not devil-bloods, we're God's children!

144
00:08:19,753 --> 00:08:20,966
Yeah!

145
00:08:21,049 --> 00:08:22,199
My comrades!

146
00:08:22,559 --> 00:08:24,527
The Owl's sent us a new ally.

147
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:27,316
Hello. It's good to meet you.

148
00:08:28,815 --> 00:08:31,416
I am here as a descendant of the royal family.

149
00:08:31,732 --> 00:08:33,306
The last on this continent.

150
00:08:33,547 --> 00:08:34,728
Dina Fritz.

151
00:08:36,511 --> 00:08:37,819
When we locked eyes,

152
00:08:38,424 --> 00:08:41,528
I decided to allow fate to steer my life where it would.

153
00:08:43,346 --> 00:08:48,291
Dina was all that remained of a branch of the
royal family that refused to flee the continent.

154
00:08:48,716 --> 00:08:52,485
She taught us secrets about the Titans
that only royalty had known before.

155
00:08:53,424 --> 00:08:56,680
We believed that she had shown us the path to victory.

156
00:08:56,973 --> 00:08:58,197
I'm sure of it!

157
00:08:58,739 --> 00:09:01,470
The King brought the Founding
Titan's power into the walls!

158
00:09:01,859 --> 00:09:07,756
If we take that power, then we can control all
other Titans, and crush Marley once and for all!

159
00:09:07,851 --> 00:09:11,395
But wait, if the King was able
to wield such an absolute power,

160
00:09:11,473 --> 00:09:13,579
then why'd he run away in the first place?

161
00:09:13,716 --> 00:09:16,924
That's simple. It's because he refused to fight.

162
00:09:17,872 --> 00:09:19,983
In the midst of the Great Titan War,

163
00:09:20,239 --> 00:09:24,774
the 145th King forsook his duty
to restore order on the continent,

164
00:09:24,932 --> 00:09:27,530
and moved his capital to a distant island.

165
00:09:27,748 --> 00:09:30,597
All our pain, all these years of anguish,

166
00:09:31,091 --> 00:09:34,434
it can all be traced to the
moment our King renounced conflict.

167
00:09:36,713 --> 00:09:37,937
Let's fight again.

168
00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:43,546
The true royal family stayed right here on
the continent and held their ground for Eldia!

169
00:09:44,205 --> 00:09:46,867
It's time we brought the Founding Titan back to them!

170
00:09:47,316 --> 00:09:50,076
Against its power, Marley will crumble.

171
00:09:50,437 --> 00:09:53,606
We'll restore Eldia and live proudly once more!

172
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:06,006
The next year, the two of us married,

173
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,159
and were blessed with a son.

174
00:10:08,972 --> 00:10:10,781
His name was Zeke.

175
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:13,069
Our royal child, Zeke.

176
00:10:13,259 --> 00:10:17,152
There's no doubt in my heart that that
someday he'll lead his people to victory.

177
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:22,650
Years pass by, and people change.

178
00:10:23,565 --> 00:10:26,083
As the world around us rapidly advanced,

179
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:29,386
a turning point came for the Restorationists.

180
00:10:31,466 --> 00:10:33,821
Now, listen up, you Eldians!

181
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:35,584
We'll soon begin recruiting new...

182
00:10:35,609 --> 00:10:38,414
The Marleyan government required Subjects of Ymir

183
00:10:38,757 --> 00:10:40,710
to become Marleyan warriors

184
00:10:40,741 --> 00:10:43,759
capable of serving as vessels for the Nine Titans.

185
00:10:45,565 --> 00:10:47,494
We've received a new message from the Owl.

186
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:50,298
He says the reason Marley's making these moves

187
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:53,548
is to prepare for an anticipated struggle over resources

188
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,106
as military technology keep advancing.

189
00:10:57,024 --> 00:11:00,676
Marley currently leads the world
using the power of its Seven Titans,

190
00:11:00,747 --> 00:11:02,559
but they may soon grow obsolete.

191
00:11:02,773 --> 00:11:06,208
An enormous cache of fossil fuel lies beneath Paradis.

192
00:11:06,346 --> 00:11:08,716
Marley can't afford to let it lie unused.

193
00:11:09,306 --> 00:11:11,207
But, 80 years ago,

194
00:11:11,232 --> 00:11:13,275
the King of the walls left behind this warning.

195
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:16,358
"If you ever interfere with our affairs,

196
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:19,988
the millions upon millions of
Titans sleeping within the walls

197
00:11:20,202 --> 00:11:22,149
will flatten the entire world."

198
00:11:22,816 --> 00:11:24,653
As long as he can make this threat,

199
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:27,024
none dare to confront him, at least not directly.

200
00:11:27,099 --> 00:11:31,087
So, the Marleyan government
has the same objective as we do.

201
00:11:31,229 --> 00:11:32,985
They'll try to infiltrate Paradis,

202
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,949
and then seize the Founding Titan for themselves.

203
00:11:37,899 --> 00:11:38,810
What do we do?

204
00:11:39,174 --> 00:11:40,461
With things as they are...

205
00:11:40,486 --> 00:11:42,480
Yeah. Marley'll get it before us.

206
00:11:42,623 --> 00:11:43,808
If they actually do it,

207
00:11:43,863 --> 00:11:46,390
we'll lose any chance we had of bringing Eldia back!

208
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:50,060
It's bad, but we still have a path forward.

209
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:55,257
I'll send my son, Zeke, to become a Marleyan warrior.

210
00:11:57,854 --> 00:11:58,768
You see, Zeke?

211
00:11:59,233 --> 00:12:02,493
Almost everything that you've
been told by the Marleyans was wrong.

212
00:12:02,692 --> 00:12:04,830
But you have to obey their every order,

213
00:12:04,892 --> 00:12:07,960
and you have to do it better and
faster than anyone else around you.

214
00:12:08,046 --> 00:12:11,345
All of us here are counting on
you to save Eldia from disgrace.

215
00:12:11,747 --> 00:12:13,695
'Kay. I understand.

216
00:12:16,466 --> 00:12:19,018
But I should've known, better than anyone,

217
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:23,594
what a wretched sin it is to
impose your beliefs on your children.

218
00:12:25,229 --> 00:12:27,351
I saw him as a child of royal blood...

219
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:29,633
as Eldia's greatest hope.

220
00:12:30,436 --> 00:12:31,984
But did I ever see him as Zeke?

221
00:12:32,562 --> 00:12:33,796
As the boy he was?

222
00:12:35,775 --> 00:12:36,641
At any rate,

223
00:12:37,388 --> 00:12:41,241
Zeke chose to protect himself,
as well as his grandparents,

224
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,388
by turning in both of his naive, foolish parents

225
00:12:45,971 --> 00:12:47,763
to Marley Public Security.

226
00:12:55,037 --> 00:12:55,993
Here we are.

227
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:04,416
So this is... paradise.

228
00:13:06,896 --> 00:13:07,664
That's right.

229
00:13:07,892 --> 00:13:10,669
This is Marley's penal colony for you Eldians,

230
00:13:10,899 --> 00:13:11,907
called Paradis.

231
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:15,490
You'll serve a life sentence for treason on this island...

232
00:13:16,226 --> 00:13:18,169
...once you've become a pure Titan.

233
00:13:21,348 --> 00:13:23,499
Answer me! Who is the Owl?

234
00:13:23,524 --> 00:13:25,972
Please! No more! I don't know!

235
00:13:26,043 --> 00:13:28,075
I've told you everything! Please...

236
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,174
Ah, I'm disappointed to hear that.

237
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,492
We'll do another then.

238
00:13:39,982 --> 00:13:41,533
I met you once before,

239
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,926
when I was just a child.

240
00:13:44,816 --> 00:13:46,253
You still remember that?

241
00:13:46,872 --> 00:13:48,652
Yeah. I could never forget it.

242
00:13:49,273 --> 00:13:51,370
Not after what you two did.

243
00:13:51,591 --> 00:13:55,224
Please, sir, just kill me now! I can't...

244
00:13:55,302 --> 00:13:56,678
Shut up and keep walking!

245
00:13:56,733 --> 00:13:58,600
Please don't make me a monster.

246
00:13:59,362 --> 00:14:00,381
Wait, Grice?

247
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:03,447
Shit. How the hell did this happen, Grisha?

248
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:06,405
Why in the world would Zeke decide to betray us?

249
00:14:06,536 --> 00:14:07,784
Isn't he your son?

250
00:14:08,687 --> 00:14:09,746
Damn it.

251
00:14:09,817 --> 00:14:12,987
Entrusting everything to you
was the stupidest thing I ever did.

252
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:14,934
It's all over now!

253
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:17,064
We're finished because of you!

254
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:19,058
Say something!

255
00:14:19,253 --> 00:14:20,449
I'm so sorry.

256
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:29,878
Why did we put all our hopes behind a naive fool like you?

257
00:14:30,562 --> 00:14:33,209
Looks like we've got a lively one.

258
00:14:33,256 --> 00:14:34,550
You're free to go.

259
00:14:36,515 --> 00:14:37,570
Grice, no!

260
00:14:38,953 --> 00:14:40,446
Grice! Hang in there!

261
00:14:40,494 --> 00:14:41,882
Run straight north!

262
00:14:42,049 --> 00:14:45,156
If you're fast enough, there's a
chance you'll make it to the wall!

263
00:14:47,357 --> 00:14:48,842
But Sergeant Major Gross...

264
00:14:48,867 --> 00:14:51,728
Hmm? This must be your first time out here.

265
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:55,200
We do this to be sure the Titans we make leave the area.

266
00:14:55,278 --> 00:14:57,123
They'll chase him for a good while.

267
00:14:57,527 --> 00:14:59,753
But they always catch 'em in the end.

268
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:02,128
Kruger knows. Eh? Right?

269
00:15:02,565 --> 00:15:03,391
Yeah.

270
00:15:03,929 --> 00:15:06,387
It's him. There's no doubt.

271
00:15:06,941 --> 00:15:09,359
That's the bastard who killed my sister!

272
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:13,259
Well, we've got a whole bunch to turn this time,

273
00:15:13,328 --> 00:15:14,871
so let's get a move on.

274
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:18,940
You can't...

275
00:15:37,304 --> 00:15:38,872
No!

276
00:15:44,338 --> 00:15:46,038
No, don't do this!

277
00:15:46,132 --> 00:15:48,174
Guys, please! You can't!

278
00:15:48,257 --> 00:15:50,035
You have to stop it. It's Grice!

279
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:53,658
Turn him already before my ears start bleeding.

280
00:15:54,149 --> 00:15:56,630
I'd like to interrogate this one a bit further.

281
00:15:56,674 --> 00:15:58,434
You can continue without me.

282
00:15:58,804 --> 00:16:00,802
Ah. This one's a woman.

283
00:16:00,997 --> 00:16:03,886
Too bad. If only you weren't a devil.

284
00:16:07,495 --> 00:16:08,390
Dina?

285
00:16:09,755 --> 00:16:10,774
My darling.

286
00:16:11,035 --> 00:16:12,363
Why'd they bring you here?

287
00:16:12,439 --> 00:16:13,299
I talked.

288
00:16:13,434 --> 00:16:15,556
I told them every last thing there was to know!

289
00:16:15,592 --> 00:16:17,009
This woman's of royal bl...

290
00:16:17,034 --> 00:16:18,385
Shut your mouth!

291
00:16:20,267 --> 00:16:22,864
Don't tell me... Is he trying to cover this up?

292
00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:24,025
Good grief.

293
00:16:24,088 --> 00:16:26,702
He'd've shut up ages ago if you'd just turned him.

294
00:16:26,845 --> 00:16:29,339
Grisha. I promise.

295
00:16:30,143 --> 00:16:32,101
No matter what form I might take,

296
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:33,885
I swear I'll come find you.

297
00:16:35,024 --> 00:16:37,166
Well isn't that romantic.

298
00:16:37,275 --> 00:16:39,382
I'm sure you'll make a great Titan couple.

299
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:42,662
No! Dina!

300
00:16:57,821 --> 00:16:58,744
What was that?

301
00:16:59,107 --> 00:16:59,958
Who am I?

302
00:17:00,316 --> 00:17:01,539
And where...?

303
00:17:01,821 --> 00:17:03,675
Hey. Just calm down.

304
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:05,583
You're still in the stockades.

305
00:17:06,049 --> 00:17:08,960
You and Mikasa, because of your insubordination.

306
00:17:09,245 --> 00:17:11,302
Were you having a nightmare? Or...

307
00:17:12,654 --> 00:17:15,244
Yeah. I guess I was.

308
00:17:15,807 --> 00:17:18,987
When you woke, you asked who you were.

309
00:17:20,124 --> 00:17:20,894
It's true.

310
00:17:21,495 --> 00:17:23,801
Also, you look like... you're crying.

311
00:17:27,662 --> 00:17:29,132
I feel strange.

312
00:17:29,459 --> 00:17:32,700
Like I just woke up from the longest dream of my life.

313
00:17:35,424 --> 00:17:36,187
Hold on.

314
00:17:36,774 --> 00:17:38,149
That was no dream.

315
00:17:38,897 --> 00:17:40,199
It was real.

316
00:17:41,414 --> 00:17:42,408
Just now,

317
00:17:42,876 --> 00:17:46,190
I was somehow reliving my dad's memories.

318
00:17:46,858 --> 00:17:47,820
That Titan.

319
00:17:48,424 --> 00:17:49,472
It was you.

320
00:17:52,411 --> 00:17:53,470
Poor Dina.

321
00:17:56,147 --> 00:17:57,731
Look at that!

322
00:17:57,831 --> 00:18:00,049
Your woman's forgotten all about you.

323
00:18:00,169 --> 00:18:05,441
I guess she fancies that Grice fellow more now, eh?

324
00:18:05,505 --> 00:18:06,673
Shut up!

325
00:18:08,325 --> 00:18:09,803
Did you say something?

326
00:18:10,315 --> 00:18:11,566
It was you!

327
00:18:11,956 --> 00:18:13,539
Fifteen years ago!

328
00:18:13,727 --> 00:18:16,132
You fed my eight-year-old sister to your dogs!

329
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:17,683
It was you!

330
00:18:20,407 --> 00:18:23,056
Tsk. I'll take this one off your hands.

331
00:18:23,136 --> 00:18:24,717
You can just head back to the ship.

332
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:26,869
Uh, understood.

333
00:18:28,341 --> 00:18:29,539
What was that about?

334
00:18:30,221 --> 00:18:33,058
The Sergeant Major's putting some time towards his hobby.

335
00:18:33,356 --> 00:18:35,513
It's best to leave it at that, rookie.

336
00:18:39,399 --> 00:18:40,310
Kruger.

337
00:18:40,732 --> 00:18:42,732
If you've finished your interrogation,

338
00:18:42,757 --> 00:18:44,982
I'd like to see this one dance.

339
00:18:45,046 --> 00:18:46,825
Huh? Wait, what?

340
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:49,099
I remember you, too, now, son.

341
00:18:49,356 --> 00:18:51,960
So I'm gonna let you go out in a special way.

342
00:18:52,237 --> 00:18:55,447
We'll turn this guy into a 3- to 4-meter Titan,

343
00:18:55,527 --> 00:18:57,663
then the two of you can fight.

344
00:18:58,753 --> 00:18:59,610
But why?

345
00:18:59,929 --> 00:19:01,739
Why do something like that?

346
00:19:02,573 --> 00:19:06,427
Do you get some sick pleasure out
of watching people get eaten alive?

347
00:19:08,608 --> 00:19:10,320
I wouldn't call it pleasure.

348
00:19:11,513 --> 00:19:13,363
I just find it interesting.

349
00:19:14,299 --> 00:19:16,564
Does that sound a bit crazy to you?

350
00:19:16,651 --> 00:19:20,266
Well, the fact is, most people wanna see cruelty.

351
00:19:20,466 --> 00:19:21,497
Don't get me wrong,

352
00:19:21,522 --> 00:19:23,316
I think peace is a wonderful thing,

353
00:19:23,364 --> 00:19:25,907
but something about it just feels lacking.

354
00:19:26,174 --> 00:19:28,665
We've pushed death out of sight and mind.

355
00:19:29,049 --> 00:19:30,580
Now that's no way to live.

356
00:19:30,651 --> 00:19:32,883
Death is always near in nature.

357
00:19:33,018 --> 00:19:36,528
And some might think me abnormal
for investigating such things.

358
00:19:36,674 --> 00:19:39,920
But to them I'd say I faced this cruel world head-on.

359
00:19:40,339 --> 00:19:43,443
And because I bothered to
deepen my understanding of death,

360
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:45,875
I can accept it when my time comes.

361
00:19:46,732 --> 00:19:48,441
See, it's about education.

362
00:19:48,568 --> 00:19:51,666
My boys learned from watching their dogs eat your sister.

363
00:19:55,507 --> 00:19:58,049
Do you not... feel any remorse?

364
00:19:58,181 --> 00:20:00,674
Well, I guess I get what you mean.

365
00:20:01,073 --> 00:20:04,027
If something that horrible were
to happen to one of my children,

366
00:20:04,089 --> 00:20:05,942
my heart would break, no question.

367
00:20:08,065 --> 00:20:09,652
You poor devils.

368
00:20:09,814 --> 00:20:12,528
It's a shame you had to be born Eldian.

369
00:20:15,031 --> 00:20:17,898
Look. That is your people's true form.

370
00:20:18,382 --> 00:20:21,155
All it takes is some Titan spinal fluid,

371
00:20:21,275 --> 00:20:24,445
and any one of you will turn into a man-eating monster.

372
00:20:24,966 --> 00:20:29,236
The whole of humanity would feel safer
if you Eldians would just disappear.

373
00:20:29,497 --> 00:20:32,287
We wish we could eradicate you from this world.

374
00:20:32,921 --> 00:20:33,892
You what?

375
00:20:34,346 --> 00:20:36,304
I have no trouble sleeping at night,

376
00:20:36,394 --> 00:20:38,499
'cause I'm not really killing humans.

377
00:20:38,596 --> 00:20:42,466
If you had restored Eldia, you'd
be butchering us Marleyans right now.

378
00:20:42,591 --> 00:20:44,870
Where's your remorse, you murderous devil?

379
00:20:45,021 --> 00:20:45,879
You're lying.

380
00:20:46,126 --> 00:20:47,937
You've always lied, but I know the truth.

381
00:20:48,001 --> 00:20:50,854
Our founder Ymir helped this continent to prosper. She...

382
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:52,652
Yeah. I've heard it before.

383
00:20:52,731 --> 00:20:57,100
Say, since your history's so wonderful, why
don't you share it with your friend down there?

384
00:20:57,231 --> 00:20:58,689
You can't do this to me!

385
00:20:58,796 --> 00:20:59,546
I'm a human being!

386
00:20:59,606 --> 00:21:00,904
Ooh, hear that?

387
00:21:00,976 --> 00:21:03,192
Your sister's calling for you.

388
00:21:31,288 --> 00:21:33,954
So is it as interesting as he said it was?

389
00:21:34,694 --> 00:21:36,616
Wait. Why'd you do that?

390
00:21:37,649 --> 00:21:39,277
Because I'm the Owl, Grisha.

391
00:21:39,942 --> 00:21:42,278
Watch closely and don't forget.

392
00:21:42,628 --> 00:21:45,385
This is how we of the Nine use our power.

393
00:23:42,091 --> 00:23:45,626
The true role of one of the
Titans is revealed through Grisha.

394
00:23:46,315 --> 00:23:50,063
And the yearning for freedom that
spurred his predecessors forward

395
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:52,047
is passed down to Eren.

396
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:56,190
Next episode: "Attack Titan."
