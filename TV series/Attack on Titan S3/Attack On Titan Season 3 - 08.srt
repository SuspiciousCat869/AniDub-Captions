1
00:00:01,333 --> 00:00:04,564
Levi and the Scouts clashed with Kenny's squad,

2
00:00:04,659 --> 00:00:06,883
charging straight into their defenses.

3
00:00:07,194 --> 00:00:10,546
All to find and rescue Eren and Historia.

4
00:00:10,954 --> 00:00:12,030
However...

5
00:00:19,586 --> 00:00:22,302
We'll re-form our defense at the fallback point!

6
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:23,803
Time to regroup!

7
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:26,686
I'm praying right now, Historia.

8
00:00:27,328 --> 00:00:31,217
For God to return and lead mankind once again!

9
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:33,749
God my ass!

10
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:37,436
If it's such an honor to become him,
then why didn't you do it yourself?

11
00:00:37,461 --> 00:00:41,462
I'm done with your shit, and
I'm not gonna let you murder me!

12
00:00:42,957 --> 00:00:45,603
That's the spirit! This is gettin' good!

13
00:00:45,698 --> 00:00:47,232
You get the hell out of here.

14
00:00:47,555 --> 00:00:49,256
I'll deal with the rest.

15
00:00:49,805 --> 00:00:50,863
Father.

16
00:00:52,418 --> 00:00:53,326
Uri.

17
00:00:54,097 --> 00:00:55,297
And Frieda.

18
00:00:55,862 --> 00:00:56,749
Just wait.

19
00:02:47,869 --> 00:02:50,761
Might be a way through. But it's blocked.

20
00:02:50,966 --> 00:02:53,730
Shit. If only we had some more gunpowder.

21
00:02:55,691 --> 00:02:57,584
Keep your guns trained on that entrance.

22
00:02:58,263 --> 00:03:00,198
If we hold them here, we win!

23
00:03:06,141 --> 00:03:07,058
That light.

24
00:03:07,119 --> 00:03:08,261
Damn it. No.

25
00:03:08,491 --> 00:03:09,276
Eren!

26
00:03:22,553 --> 00:03:24,452
Everyone, brace yourselves!

27
00:03:29,307 --> 00:03:31,428
Hey guys, this place is about to collapse.

28
00:03:35,566 --> 00:03:36,330
Captain!

29
00:03:37,176 --> 00:03:38,338
It opened up!

30
00:03:41,485 --> 00:03:42,939
Okay, Armin! Moblit!

31
00:03:43,145 --> 00:03:45,441
You two take Hange and find a way out of here!

32
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:51,830
Stupid bastard. What the hell are you doin'?

33
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,879
Just leave me, Historia!

34
00:03:54,062 --> 00:03:55,778
That Titan's from your family!

35
00:03:56,072 --> 00:03:58,438
Let him eat me and everything'll be all right!

36
00:03:58,669 --> 00:03:59,853
Get out of here!

37
00:04:00,337 --> 00:04:01,232
...Not a chance!

38
00:04:01,256 --> 00:04:02,746
...Why won't you listen?

39
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,026
I might be an enemy of humanity now,

40
00:04:05,051 --> 00:04:06,646
but I'm still <i>your</i> ally!

41
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:11,276
I can't be selfless, and I don't want to be a god.

42
00:04:11,531 --> 00:04:13,994
But... when I see someone crying,

43
00:04:14,371 --> 00:04:16,038
saying that no one's needs them,

44
00:04:16,508 --> 00:04:18,984
I have to go and show them that it isn't true!

45
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,304
You're feeling like I felt for my entire life.

46
00:04:23,153 --> 00:04:25,483
That's why I need you to be okay!

47
00:04:28,607 --> 00:04:29,678
Uh!

48
00:04:29,924 --> 00:04:31,259
Historia!

49
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:32,617
...Uh!

50
00:04:33,029 --> 00:04:33,450
...Hey.

51
00:04:34,121 --> 00:04:34,944
Mikasa!

52
00:04:38,686 --> 00:04:39,720
Give me the keys!

53
00:04:39,745 --> 00:04:41,611
Captain. All of you.

54
00:04:45,369 --> 00:04:46,776
Conny, hurry!

55
00:04:47,384 --> 00:04:49,406
Just leave me here. Forget it!

56
00:04:49,486 --> 00:04:50,781
Hurry up and escape!

57
00:04:50,806 --> 00:04:53,094
Stop whining! Ya half-naked weirdo!

58
00:04:53,473 --> 00:04:56,263
We've got gunmen and a Titan coming at us, so pipe down!

59
00:04:57,717 --> 00:04:58,852
Feet're loose!

60
00:05:00,873 --> 00:05:04,926
Whoa. It's even bigger than the Colossal Titan. Crazy.

61
00:05:08,403 --> 00:05:10,366
The ceiling. Look out!

62
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,740
Get back!

63
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:20,767
Damn it all, Rod!

64
00:05:21,602 --> 00:05:23,358
You really screwed the pooch.

65
00:05:23,818 --> 00:05:28,258
Here I thought you were the one man alive that
understood Titans, but you didn't know enough.

66
00:05:28,487 --> 00:05:29,409
You dumbass!

67
00:05:30,241 --> 00:05:31,558
Captain Ackermann!

68
00:05:32,055 --> 00:05:33,409
No! Get back!

69
00:05:37,588 --> 00:05:40,025
Damn it. We'll be buried alive!

70
00:05:41,896 --> 00:05:45,620
Why? Shouldn't he be trying to eat me?

71
00:05:48,957 --> 00:05:50,618
Should I transform?

72
00:05:51,293 --> 00:05:54,938
No. My Titan would only get crushed.

73
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,939
Sorry. I can't.

74
00:06:08,681 --> 00:06:11,170
I've been dead weight every damn step of the way.

75
00:06:11,717 --> 00:06:14,308
This power never should've been given to me.

76
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:17,305
I can't be humanity's hope. I'm just too weak.

77
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:22,987
Armor?

78
00:06:24,206 --> 00:06:26,766
C'mon. Stop playin' the tragic hero.

79
00:06:27,819 --> 00:06:31,964
Of course you're too weak to accomplish
jack by yourself, but no one expects you to.

80
00:06:32,036 --> 00:06:33,250
Yeah, calm it down.

81
00:06:33,862 --> 00:06:35,929
We've been through a whole lot worse than this, man.

82
00:06:36,136 --> 00:06:38,081
Not that I really wanna get used to it.

83
00:06:38,453 --> 00:06:42,458
Still, it's gonna suck tryin' to fly through that mess.

84
00:06:43,674 --> 00:06:44,753
I'll take Eren.

85
00:06:45,389 --> 00:06:47,758
It's gonna take all we have to not get hit.

86
00:06:47,901 --> 00:06:49,297
...So hold on for your life.

87
00:06:49,321 --> 00:06:50,030
...Right.

88
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:53,702
It's useless. You know we won't make it.

89
00:06:53,877 --> 00:06:55,298
So we should do nothing?

90
00:06:55,527 --> 00:06:57,649
Wanna sit here and hold hands 'til we're crushed?

91
00:06:57,728 --> 00:06:59,024
Or 'til we burn to death?

92
00:06:59,262 --> 00:07:02,059
You know dying here won't make anything better!

93
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:07,992
Listen. I really hate that I do
this to you all the time, but...

94
00:07:09,619 --> 00:07:11,758
You've gotta make a choice here.

95
00:07:16,381 --> 00:07:17,828
I'm with you!

96
00:07:25,457 --> 00:07:26,235
Eren!

97
00:07:27,379 --> 00:07:30,899
I'm sorry. But since it's the end,

98
00:07:31,097 --> 00:07:34,179
this one time, just let me.

99
00:07:34,782 --> 00:07:37,327
Let me believe I can do this!

100
00:07:57,107 --> 00:07:58,784
Whoa. What the...?

101
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:01,276
Come on! Get under Eren!

102
00:08:06,649 --> 00:08:07,934
Caven!

103
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:27,487
What's going on?

104
00:08:35,305 --> 00:08:36,193
Whoa, look out!

105
00:08:36,218 --> 00:08:37,578
We just need to keep moving!

106
00:08:47,411 --> 00:08:49,302
Section Commander! Are you okay?

107
00:08:49,484 --> 00:08:51,891
Yeah. What happened?

108
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:08,949
What the hell is that?

109
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,424
If it's that big from a distance...

110
00:09:12,558 --> 00:09:15,732
That thing must be at least twice
the size of the Colossal Titan.

111
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,169
It'll break through the wall in an instant.

112
00:09:18,615 --> 00:09:19,656
What now?

113
00:09:20,606 --> 00:09:21,704
We advance!

114
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:32,781
Eren.

115
00:09:34,902 --> 00:09:36,293
Can you hear me?

116
00:09:37,548 --> 00:09:39,080
Wake up!

117
00:09:43,067 --> 00:09:43,792
Eren!

118
00:10:05,737 --> 00:10:07,451
Not too shabby, Eren.

119
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:12,861
Even after we cut you from it,
the Titan hasn't disappeared.

120
00:10:13,825 --> 00:10:15,420
This could be a game changer.

121
00:10:20,338 --> 00:10:21,737
I almost forgot.

122
00:10:22,134 --> 00:10:24,563
Listen, before I transformed,

123
00:10:24,611 --> 00:10:27,130
I drank from a bottle that said "armor."

124
00:10:27,503 --> 00:10:31,223
Gotcha. Guess that's all you needed to pull it off,

125
00:10:31,382 --> 00:10:33,183
because this time you did it easily.

126
00:10:33,739 --> 00:10:35,157
You saved all our lives.

127
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:39,176
You came up with and built everything
we see here in the blink of an eye.

128
00:10:40,915 --> 00:10:43,909
It's not exactly pretty, but I can see its potential.

129
00:10:44,544 --> 00:10:46,729
I bet this is how the walls were made too.

130
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:48,892
Guess what?

131
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:54,517
This means we finally have a real
shot at plugging the hole in Wall Maria.

132
00:10:56,091 --> 00:10:57,998
We had a hell of a time getting here.

133
00:10:58,282 --> 00:10:59,665
Took long detours.

134
00:11:00,023 --> 00:11:01,279
Watched friends die.

135
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:03,589
But as ugly as it's been,

136
00:11:04,066 --> 00:11:05,855
look at the position we're in now.

137
00:11:07,563 --> 00:11:11,663
If we can pull it off, and retake Wall Maria,

138
00:11:12,155 --> 00:11:14,078
I can finally go to the cellar.

139
00:11:14,745 --> 00:11:17,590
But knowing what my dad did...

140
00:11:23,064 --> 00:11:23,802
Mm.

141
00:11:24,453 --> 00:11:25,148
Captain!

142
00:11:26,652 --> 00:11:28,372
We've secured an exit, sir!

143
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:32,160
Hange's fine! Armin and Moblit, too!

144
00:11:32,953 --> 00:11:34,375
I'm glad to hear it.

145
00:11:34,669 --> 00:11:35,417
Eren!

146
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:36,951
You okay?

147
00:11:37,387 --> 00:11:40,121
Uh! We're all safe, thanks to you!

148
00:11:40,335 --> 00:11:43,576
But to be completely honest, when
I saw you run off into the light,

149
00:11:43,601 --> 00:11:46,079
stumbling like a drunk and wailing like a baby,

150
00:11:46,158 --> 00:11:47,477
I thought we were screwed!

151
00:11:47,612 --> 00:11:49,884
You looked like an idiot and my fate was in your hands.

152
00:11:49,971 --> 00:11:50,886
It was awful!

153
00:11:50,981 --> 00:11:53,252
Quit your bawling! Have some dignity!

154
00:11:53,475 --> 00:11:54,866
That's what I was thinking anyway.

155
00:11:55,056 --> 00:11:55,804
Relax.

156
00:11:57,412 --> 00:12:00,943
Let's go. We have a big-ass Titan to catch.

157
00:12:03,171 --> 00:12:04,201
Hey. Here.

158
00:12:34,392 --> 00:12:36,005
Uh! Damn it.

159
00:12:36,696 --> 00:12:38,999
It's too hot. We can't get close.

160
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:41,439
Commander. We can't seem to distract it.

161
00:12:41,604 --> 00:12:44,100
It's an Abnormal. It doesn't care about us.

162
00:12:44,527 --> 00:12:46,246
That's all right. Fall back.

163
00:12:46,539 --> 00:12:48,168
We know what direction it's going.

164
00:12:48,438 --> 00:12:50,321
That tells us enough to make a plan.

165
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:53,222
We found Levi Squad! They're nearby!

166
00:12:53,936 --> 00:12:55,271
They succeeded, sir!

167
00:12:55,398 --> 00:12:57,049
They have Eren and Historia!

168
00:13:03,405 --> 00:13:04,174
Erwin.

169
00:13:05,937 --> 00:13:07,081
Anyone hurt?

170
00:13:07,719 --> 00:13:09,623
Yeah, Hange took a hit.

171
00:13:11,738 --> 00:13:13,719
Doesn't look like anything too serious.

172
00:13:13,901 --> 00:13:15,800
You've done excellent work, all of you.

173
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:19,726
I've got a whole slew of things to report, but first...

174
00:13:19,765 --> 00:13:21,092
Anything on that Titan?

175
00:13:21,671 --> 00:13:23,006
It's Rod Reiss.

176
00:13:24,563 --> 00:13:26,701
Look forward to hearing your thoughts on this.

177
00:13:27,066 --> 00:13:28,108
Commander.

178
00:13:33,359 --> 00:13:36,260
Time's short. We can't afford to stand here and chat.

179
00:13:36,792 --> 00:13:37,849
Head back to the wall.

180
00:13:38,906 --> 00:13:41,981
You're gonna let that thing drag
its fat ass all the way to Sina?

181
00:13:43,094 --> 00:13:44,429
Well, more specifically,

182
00:13:45,431 --> 00:13:48,139
I'm letting it continue towards Orvud District.

183
00:14:15,985 --> 00:14:17,883
All right. Time to think.

184
00:14:19,044 --> 00:14:22,657
First off, Lord Reiss was
after the Founding Titan's power.

185
00:14:22,967 --> 00:14:25,504
And that power currently resides within Eren.

186
00:14:26,052 --> 00:14:31,367
Thing is, the Founding Titan can only be
used at full potential by someone of royal blood.

187
00:14:32,058 --> 00:14:36,126
But then, when a royal does
obtain the Founding Titan's power,

188
00:14:36,325 --> 00:14:42,093
they suddenly take on the First King's ideology, which
means they'll refuse to do anything about the Titans.

189
00:14:44,182 --> 00:14:47,328
Well, this certainly is a conundrum.

190
00:14:48,067 --> 00:14:51,055
So the First King thinks this is true peace, huh?

191
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:54,319
I'm gonna have to go ahead and disagree with him there.

192
00:14:56,067 --> 00:14:59,968
You know, we still have the option to go back.

193
00:15:01,063 --> 00:15:02,958
We just need that Titan to eat me,

194
00:15:03,383 --> 00:15:05,275
and Reiss will become a human again.

195
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:08,651
We could still have a true Founding Titan.

196
00:15:09,095 --> 00:15:10,461
It's possible.

197
00:15:10,772 --> 00:15:11,917
Wait, you don't mean?

198
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:14,054
It's worth considering.

199
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:18,360
Once Reiss turns back into a human, we could capture him,

200
00:15:18,495 --> 00:15:20,720
and undo the First King's brainwashing.

201
00:15:21,308 --> 00:15:25,557
Assuming that it can be done, it
may well open a path to save humanity.

202
00:15:27,654 --> 00:15:28,759
Tell me, Eren.

203
00:15:29,712 --> 00:15:33,168
If that turns out to be our best
bet, are you really willing to do it?

204
00:15:35,564 --> 00:15:36,474
Yes, I am.

205
00:15:40,256 --> 00:15:42,528
Eren. I can't let you.

206
00:15:44,044 --> 00:15:46,175
Let's not forget the other option.

207
00:15:47,716 --> 00:15:51,339
First off, the plan you're discussing is full of flaws.

208
00:15:51,878 --> 00:15:56,376
For one thing, it might not be possible to
free my father from the First King's will.

209
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,212
And no matter how you restrain him,

210
00:15:59,379 --> 00:16:01,977
if he alters everyone's memories, we're finished.

211
00:16:02,858 --> 00:16:08,022
And consider how much there is that we still don't
know about the Founding Titan. This isn't worth the risk.

212
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,207
She's right.

213
00:16:10,064 --> 00:16:13,735
It's not even guaranteed that Reiss
would turn back to normal if he did eat Eren.

214
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,285
That's just a hypothesis.

215
00:16:15,459 --> 00:16:17,868
No one's actually seen it happen before.

216
00:16:18,027 --> 00:16:18,536
Mm.

217
00:16:20,149 --> 00:16:23,716
So far, we've only been led by destructive pacifists.

218
00:16:23,937 --> 00:16:27,157
And if they'd kept the Founding
Titan's powers, that's how it would stay.

219
00:16:27,315 --> 00:16:30,183
This is humanity's first chance to escape from them.

220
00:16:31,756 --> 00:16:34,513
Eren. Your father wasn't evil.

221
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:37,715
He was trying to save humanity from the First King.

222
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:41,694
He stole the Founding Titan from my sister,

223
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,530
and then he murdered my father's wife and children

224
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:47,366
because he had no other choice.

225
00:16:50,391 --> 00:16:53,824
Mikasa's life. Armin's life.

226
00:16:54,157 --> 00:16:58,400
Everyone's life hinges on your
being able to control this power!

227
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,276
You mean...

228
00:17:02,141 --> 00:17:03,214
Yeah, that's right.

229
00:17:03,508 --> 00:17:04,890
The Doctor Jaeger I knew would only have done

230
00:17:05,184 --> 00:17:08,045
something like that if he felt like he had to.

231
00:17:08,076 --> 00:17:10,690
Agreed. He must've known of another way.

232
00:17:10,936 --> 00:17:13,360
A way to save humanity without Reiss blood.

233
00:17:13,431 --> 00:17:16,108
And that must've been why he
left you the key to the cellar.

234
00:17:20,955 --> 00:17:22,267
What? Your cellar?

235
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,587
Oh, yeah, right. I'd forgotten all about that.

236
00:17:24,714 --> 00:17:26,365
You mean it's actually important now?

237
00:17:26,602 --> 00:17:27,946
Apparently, it is.

238
00:17:28,017 --> 00:17:31,120
What matters most to me is that
we have a way to plug Wall Maria.

239
00:17:32,043 --> 00:17:34,694
The way I see it, that makes our choice pretty clear.

240
00:17:35,272 --> 00:17:38,123
You know, that's actually a fairly convincing argument.

241
00:17:39,019 --> 00:17:42,986
For whatever it's worth, I think we
should stick with Eren too. But listen.

242
00:17:43,169 --> 00:17:45,035
Are you sure about this, Historia?

243
00:17:45,543 --> 00:17:50,667
That Titan's a major threat. It's not like we can
just let it wander around freely inside the walls.

244
00:17:51,087 --> 00:17:53,861
Capturing it isn't an option... it's way too big.

245
00:17:54,461 --> 00:17:55,720
Which means that...

246
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:01,210
...our only way forward is to kill your father.

247
00:18:23,379 --> 00:18:26,403
Eren. I should apologize.

248
00:18:26,783 --> 00:18:27,585
What?

249
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,229
Under the Reiss Chapel.

250
00:18:31,233 --> 00:18:35,286
I really considered turning into a Titan and killing you.

251
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:40,172
And honestly, it wasn't to save humanity.

252
00:18:40,783 --> 00:18:43,105
I just wanted to believe my father was right.

253
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:48,356
Even more than that, I wanted him to like me.

254
00:18:53,893 --> 00:18:56,578
But it's time for me and him to part ways now.

255
00:19:15,046 --> 00:19:17,373
Please have your squad stand by in the hall now.

256
00:19:18,127 --> 00:19:19,975
They're almost ready to begin the meeting.

257
00:19:20,278 --> 00:19:21,446
We'll be right there.

258
00:19:23,489 --> 00:19:26,238
Historia. I forgot to tell you.

259
00:19:26,921 --> 00:19:28,642
There's something we need you to do.

260
00:19:28,945 --> 00:19:29,948
What's that?

261
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:34,458
This is an order from Erwin.

262
00:19:34,809 --> 00:19:36,625
Once we finish off this Titan,

263
00:19:37,145 --> 00:19:39,649
seeing as you're the true successor to the throne,

264
00:19:39,744 --> 00:19:40,903
you'll become queen.

265
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:44,987
Wait. Queen Historia?

266
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:46,187
You're kidding, right?

267
00:19:46,266 --> 00:19:51,762
The coup d'état was successful, but the
people won't follow military rule forever.

268
00:19:52,452 --> 00:19:54,615
We need to give them a heartwarming story.

269
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:58,674
One where the rightful heir
retakes her crown from the pretender.

270
00:19:59,591 --> 00:20:00,724
Oh, I see.

271
00:20:03,816 --> 00:20:08,708
Hey. Uh, you heard what Historia was
saying earlier, didn't you, Captain?

272
00:20:09,122 --> 00:20:12,348
'Cause, well, it sounded to me like, maybe,

273
00:20:12,538 --> 00:20:17,384
in siding against her dad, she finally
broke off from that part of her life, ya know?

274
00:20:17,637 --> 00:20:18,759
It's just like...

275
00:20:18,894 --> 00:20:22,272
Like what? You have something to say, then say it.

276
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:23,542
Um. I...

277
00:20:24,012 --> 00:20:25,060
Hey, Captain?

278
00:20:26,102 --> 00:20:27,643
What Conny's trying to say, is that Historia

279
00:20:27,865 --> 00:20:30,734
finally broke free from the Reiss family,

280
00:20:30,956 --> 00:20:33,252
and decided she's more than just a bloodline.

281
00:20:33,776 --> 00:20:37,766
So for us to force her into
another role, for that reason... I...

282
00:20:38,925 --> 00:20:41,109
I just don't think it's fair.

283
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:42,119
It's fine.

284
00:20:42,278 --> 00:20:42,778
Huh?

285
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,282
If my next duty is to become a queen,

286
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,355
then that's what I'll do.

287
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,738
But Historia.

288
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:58,874
I do appreciate your concern, but whether this
is "forced" on me is really up to me to decide.

289
00:20:58,937 --> 00:21:00,749
And I've decided.

290
00:21:02,076 --> 00:21:06,938
Captain. Before that, I have one condition for you.

291
00:21:07,692 --> 00:21:08,716
And that is?

292
00:21:09,312 --> 00:21:10,984
While my fate is still my own,

293
00:21:11,433 --> 00:21:13,666
I want to put everything I have on the line.

294
00:21:23,662 --> 00:21:26,872
Once you're queen, you can punch
that smug runt right in the face.

295
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:28,795
Sirs.

296
00:21:29,693 --> 00:21:31,941
We have determined the Reiss Titan's location.

297
00:21:32,449 --> 00:21:34,208
It's southwest, approaching Orvud.

298
00:21:34,673 --> 00:21:37,947
It's fast. At this rate, it'll
reach the walls before dawn.

299
00:21:38,328 --> 00:21:40,632
Right, understood. Commander Erwin.

300
00:21:41,283 --> 00:21:43,852
I'm sure everyone here would like to hear your plan.

301
00:21:44,418 --> 00:21:46,975
How can we evacuate the people in such a short time?

302
00:21:47,282 --> 00:21:48,887
That's not part of the plan.

303
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:50,514
What's that?

304
00:21:51,006 --> 00:21:52,573
The people of Orvud District

305
00:21:52,994 --> 00:21:55,036
will need to stay exactly where they are.

306
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:58,048
But Commander.

307
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:45,301
At Orvud District, Eren and the
others face off against Rod Reiss' Titan.

308
00:23:45,912 --> 00:23:50,753
Despite the danger, Historia is
determined to decide her own fate.

309
00:23:51,357 --> 00:23:54,365
Next episode: "Ruler of the Walls."
