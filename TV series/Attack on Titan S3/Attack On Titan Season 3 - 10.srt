1
00:00:08,256 --> 00:00:10,042
Commander. We're good to go.

2
00:00:11,005 --> 00:00:12,386
Now! Drop it!

3
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:36,322
Captain Levi!

4
00:00:37,283 --> 00:00:40,064
What? You look like you're gonna shit yourself.

5
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,633
We've found Kenny Ackermann... he's still alive!

6
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:34,645
For a long time, I actually figured
I was the strongest man in the world.

7
00:02:36,148 --> 00:02:37,735
So this is a Titan.

8
00:02:38,002 --> 00:02:39,999
I guess they really do exist.

9
00:02:42,286 --> 00:02:44,313
Within the walls, no less.

10
00:02:49,707 --> 00:02:52,569
Good! You hold him right there, Uri!

11
00:02:53,084 --> 00:02:54,904
Hold on, Rod. Don't shoot.

12
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,384
Someone must've told him we'd be here.

13
00:02:59,228 --> 00:03:01,102
Probably a council member.

14
00:03:01,632 --> 00:03:03,762
We need to determine who it was.

15
00:03:03,999 --> 00:03:07,346
Fine. Make him talk with your
power and I'll shoot him after!

16
00:03:08,334 --> 00:03:13,090
That I cannot do. This is a guess, but still,

17
00:03:13,382 --> 00:03:16,554
I'm fairly certain that this
man's part of the Ackermann clan.

18
00:03:17,443 --> 00:03:21,687
Which means, that his motivations
for raising a blade at me...

19
00:03:22,178 --> 00:03:24,259
...are entirely his own.

20
00:03:26,761 --> 00:03:27,635
Uri!

21
00:03:30,536 --> 00:03:33,460
If you're not willing to kill
the bastard, I'll do it for you!

22
00:03:33,485 --> 00:03:34,929
Argh, shit!

23
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,923
Hey, are you really the king, or what?

24
00:03:37,065 --> 00:03:39,649
Why don't'cha do the magnanimous thing and let go of me?

25
00:03:39,724 --> 00:03:42,444
Get your big hand off me! I gotta get outta here!

26
00:03:42,932 --> 00:03:46,283
C'mon, just gimme one more chance
and I'll do it right next time.

27
00:03:46,308 --> 00:03:48,468
Against such overwhelming power,

28
00:03:48,675 --> 00:03:50,089
I had nothing.

29
00:03:50,913 --> 00:03:54,118
After all, he could've crushed me to death at any moment.

30
00:03:54,379 --> 00:03:58,424
Violence was all I had, and for
the first time, it'd failed me.

31
00:03:58,487 --> 00:04:00,840
...blown a new hole in your pampered, royal ass!

32
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:02,285
Lookin' back on it now,

33
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:06,853
I don't think my family's persecution
was all that big a part of what drove me.

34
00:04:11,756 --> 00:04:12,924
No. Why'd you...?

35
00:04:15,332 --> 00:04:16,673
You hurt my leg.

36
00:04:18,004 --> 00:04:19,515
Hey. Uri!

37
00:04:22,334 --> 00:04:24,816
You're crazy. What'd you let him go for?

38
00:04:24,982 --> 00:04:26,760
Your voice won't work on an Ackermann.

39
00:04:27,268 --> 00:04:28,316
We have to kill him!

40
00:04:42,773 --> 00:04:47,846
Considering... the persecution that your
family's been put through on my behalf,

41
00:04:48,658 --> 00:04:50,031
you've a right to hate me.

42
00:04:51,903 --> 00:04:56,286
That said, I must apologize,
because I cannot die just yet.

43
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:01,474
Please. Forgive me.

44
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:08,428
Even within the tiny world of the walls,

45
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:10,437
I couldn't build paradise.

46
00:05:11,393 --> 00:05:12,855
I'm such a fool.

47
00:05:15,249 --> 00:05:17,263
He was an omnipotent king,

48
00:05:17,628 --> 00:05:20,790
and he bowed down to a piece of trash like me.

49
00:05:21,606 --> 00:05:24,183
His Titan form had shocked me plenty,

50
00:05:24,765 --> 00:05:30,141
but when he bowed, that rattled something
inside me like nothing ever had before.

51
00:05:31,365 --> 00:05:36,082
I asked if he had any use for my blade, and Uri nodded.

52
00:05:41,052 --> 00:05:42,897
Next time the council met,

53
00:05:43,241 --> 00:05:45,749
the man who tipped me off about Uri was gone.

54
00:05:46,374 --> 00:05:48,778
In his place sat the Reiss' new dog,

55
00:05:48,966 --> 00:05:50,722
legs kicked up on the table.

56
00:05:52,613 --> 00:05:55,131
I had found myself a new line of work.

57
00:05:56,254 --> 00:05:58,405
I felt a bit pathetic for doin' it, but that did

58
00:05:58,768 --> 00:06:01,616
bring an end to the Ackermann's persecution.

59
00:06:02,709 --> 00:06:05,587
Now, walking around in broad daylight was still

60
00:06:05,744 --> 00:06:07,408
more risk than it was worth.

61
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:10,366
But I had fewer enemies.

62
00:06:12,631 --> 00:06:13,736
Kuchel, huh?

63
00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:20,854
Ah. Well if you mean Olympia, that woman's been sick
for so long now that even her old regulars quit usin' her.

64
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,183
Whew, you look rough.

65
00:06:33,714 --> 00:06:35,224
Damn, have you lost some weight?

66
00:06:35,797 --> 00:06:38,776
You're like a skeleton. Hey Kuchel?

67
00:06:39,364 --> 00:06:40,223
She's dead.

68
00:06:40,322 --> 00:06:40,770
Huh?

69
00:06:45,848 --> 00:06:46,737
And you?

70
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:50,264
Are you alive?

71
00:06:53,592 --> 00:06:55,975
Ah, gimme a break. You're not deaf, are ya?

72
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,516
Can ya hear me or can't ya?

73
00:06:59,256 --> 00:07:00,264
You got a name?

74
00:07:01,724 --> 00:07:02,514
Levi.

75
00:07:04,068 --> 00:07:05,460
It's just Levi.

76
00:07:13,161 --> 00:07:17,252
Mm. I get it, Kuchel.

77
00:07:17,996 --> 00:07:19,738
That's prob'ly a good call.

78
00:07:20,762 --> 00:07:23,067
The family name did you no favors.

79
00:07:29,597 --> 00:07:32,911
Well, I'm Kenny. That's my only name.

80
00:07:34,182 --> 00:07:35,993
Me and your mother knew each other.

81
00:07:37,425 --> 00:07:38,812
It's nice to meet'cha.

82
00:07:41,935 --> 00:07:44,289
The only thing Kuchel left behind

83
00:07:44,773 --> 00:07:47,682
was an unsociable brat on the brink of death.

84
00:07:48,664 --> 00:07:51,862
I wasn't so heartless that I'd let the runt die, but

85
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:54,745
I wasn't about to step in as a parent either.

86
00:07:56,411 --> 00:07:58,582
There wasn't much I could teach the brat.

87
00:07:59,716 --> 00:08:02,379
Figured grippin' a knife was a good place to start.

88
00:08:03,217 --> 00:08:05,271
Then it was gettin' along with others.

89
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:07,234
And how to say hello.

90
00:08:08,148 --> 00:08:11,421
How to swing a deal. And how to swing a knife.

91
00:08:12,932 --> 00:08:16,538
I taught him everything he'd need
to know to survive in the underground.

92
00:08:18,565 --> 00:08:23,554
I figured he might try and make a go of it
on the surface someday, but when the time came,

93
00:08:23,933 --> 00:08:27,136
well, that was somethin' he would have to do himself.

94
00:08:31,047 --> 00:08:31,840
Join me.

95
00:08:32,825 --> 00:08:34,794
Let us pray for peace in this world.

96
00:08:37,201 --> 00:08:38,695
Interior Police?

97
00:08:39,506 --> 00:08:42,278
Ah. So you're with the MPs then, are ya?

98
00:08:42,932 --> 00:08:46,330
Apologies. I bet I killed a fair few of your pals.

99
00:08:46,632 --> 00:08:48,141
And yet look at you now.

100
00:08:48,443 --> 00:08:50,993
The king convinced you to change your ways.

101
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:54,467
The grace and glory of our king are truly boundless.

102
00:08:55,756 --> 00:09:00,233
Yeah, he's somethin'. Seems like he's
just about everything to you, eh, Sannes?

103
00:09:01,018 --> 00:09:03,682
Because of that, I'll do anything he needs me to.

104
00:09:04,834 --> 00:09:06,445
Are you any different?

105
00:09:07,193 --> 00:09:09,219
Why did <i>you</i> choose to serve the king?

106
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:11,651
That's tough.

107
00:09:14,724 --> 00:09:19,349
I dunno. Prob'ly because he's the strongest around.

108
00:09:20,464 --> 00:09:23,934
Yeah. In our world, the one on top

109
00:09:24,452 --> 00:09:26,928
is whoever can prove that they're the strongest.

110
00:09:28,664 --> 00:09:30,481
All you need is power.

111
00:09:31,876 --> 00:09:36,742
If you have that, then at the very
least, you won't go out like my sister did.

112
00:09:47,116 --> 00:09:49,000
I don't have much time left.

113
00:09:50,076 --> 00:09:51,464
I could'a told you that.

114
00:09:52,297 --> 00:09:53,926
Funny how you're a monster,

115
00:09:54,491 --> 00:09:57,200
yet you still can't beat disease and old age.

116
00:09:57,316 --> 00:09:59,393
Seein' you die'll be a letdown.

117
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:01,458
That isn't what I meant.

118
00:10:01,847 --> 00:10:02,412
Eh?

119
00:10:04,089 --> 00:10:06,806
This power will soon pass to Rod's children,

120
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:10,746
and I will live on inside of their memories.

121
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:15,060
What the hell is that s'posed to mean?

122
00:10:15,518 --> 00:10:17,292
You can give that power away?

123
00:10:23,749 --> 00:10:26,722
Kenny, in the not too distant future,

124
00:10:26,901 --> 00:10:28,336
this world will crumble.

125
00:10:29,882 --> 00:10:32,007
In humanity's fading twilight,

126
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:35,170
it's my wish to build us a paradise.

127
00:10:37,419 --> 00:10:39,413
You believe in violence, do you not?

128
00:10:41,002 --> 00:10:43,387
It's the unavoidable truth of our world.

129
00:10:44,506 --> 00:10:45,436
Although...

130
00:10:45,783 --> 00:10:50,256
On the day that we first met, something
turned us from mortal enemies to friends.

131
00:10:52,092 --> 00:10:52,917
What was it?

132
00:10:55,557 --> 00:10:59,702
Huh. No idea. But I'll tell ya this.

133
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:03,514
If you hadn't squeezed me in
that stupidly big hand of yours,

134
00:11:03,768 --> 00:11:06,756
I'd have stuffed your skull full of shit for sure.

135
00:11:08,309 --> 00:11:11,349
You had to really wear me out before I'd be your friend.

136
00:11:12,871 --> 00:11:16,258
Yeah. The world's unavoidable truth.

137
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:22,855
Even so, I believe in the miracle

138
00:11:23,151 --> 00:11:24,673
that happened between us.

139
00:11:28,026 --> 00:11:30,561
Me and Uri never quite saw eye to eye.

140
00:11:31,268 --> 00:11:32,300
Not on that.

141
00:11:42,358 --> 00:11:45,618
Just like he said, the monster was passed on.

142
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:50,052
Only took a glance for me to know he wasn't gone.

143
00:11:51,714 --> 00:11:53,817
Rod's daughter preached to anyone who'd listen.

144
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:56,740
That same talk about love and peace.

145
00:11:57,065 --> 00:11:58,757
His words from her mouth.

146
00:12:00,232 --> 00:12:03,169
How'd they find the time to talk about such useless shit?

147
00:12:04,589 --> 00:12:07,315
Is it a luxury that only the powerful can afford?

148
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,786
Would anyone feel that way if they just had that power?

149
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:17,046
What about... me?

150
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:20,859
My name is Kenny Ackermann.

151
00:12:21,297 --> 00:12:24,547
Not a fan of the name, but I've
also been called Kenny the Ripper.

152
00:12:25,756 --> 00:12:29,768
That's because I've slit so many MP
throats like yours that I got bored of it.

153
00:12:30,475 --> 00:12:32,134
But a lot's happened since.

154
00:12:33,381 --> 00:12:38,466
And as of today, it looks like I'm gonna be the
captain of this new Anti-Personnel Control Squad.

155
00:12:39,109 --> 00:12:40,204
Nice to meet'cha.

156
00:12:41,256 --> 00:12:41,722
Huh?

157
00:12:46,238 --> 00:12:49,579
So yeah, I realize it doesn't make sense.

158
00:12:50,381 --> 00:12:52,192
If I were you, I'd be pissed, too.

159
00:12:52,424 --> 00:12:55,348
Bein' led by a crazed killer
who's not even from the military.

160
00:12:55,881 --> 00:12:56,909
It doesn't matter.

161
00:12:57,286 --> 00:12:57,746
Hmm?

162
00:12:58,172 --> 00:12:59,948
The wall fell two years ago.

163
00:13:00,464 --> 00:13:02,347
We've given up on fighting the Titans.

164
00:13:02,491 --> 00:13:05,923
Instead we'll fight each other
over what little land we have left.

165
00:13:06,172 --> 00:13:08,671
That's the whole reason this squad was created, right?

166
00:13:09,547 --> 00:13:11,143
That's what all of us are here for.

167
00:13:11,492 --> 00:13:14,884
We followed the rules, climbed up
through the ranks, and now here we are.

168
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:19,245
What do I care? It's fine by me.

169
00:13:24,906 --> 00:13:26,722
Heh. No need to worry.

170
00:13:27,047 --> 00:13:30,472
I didn't really ask for this squad
because I wanna fight the Scouts.

171
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:33,230
No, that was just a little pretext I thought up.

172
00:13:33,692 --> 00:13:37,189
Somethin' to make those jackasses
on the council nod their heads.

173
00:13:37,705 --> 00:13:39,634
So why are we here?

174
00:13:40,401 --> 00:13:44,449
I'll tell you why. It's all for a grand dream!

175
00:13:46,164 --> 00:13:48,421
That godlike power.

176
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:54,943
Whoever gets their hands on it
suddenly becomes compassionate.

177
00:13:56,236 --> 00:13:58,883
Would it be the same for a bastard like me?

178
00:14:00,602 --> 00:14:01,967
I gotta know.

179
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,398
What does it feel like?

180
00:14:05,379 --> 00:14:08,838
From that vantage point, what is it you could see?

181
00:14:11,744 --> 00:14:13,526
Could trash like me...

182
00:14:16,318 --> 00:14:19,731
...ever be able to see this
world in the same light you did?

183
00:14:27,569 --> 00:14:30,249
Well... Uri?

184
00:14:39,377 --> 00:14:40,180
Kenny.

185
00:14:58,742 --> 00:15:00,885
Between the burns and the blood you've lost,

186
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:03,753
there's nothing that can save you now.

187
00:15:07,177 --> 00:15:08,393
Oh, yeah?

188
00:15:10,357 --> 00:15:11,714
I wonder.

189
00:15:15,266 --> 00:15:19,151
Swiped this sucker out of Rod's bag back in the cave.

190
00:15:20,424 --> 00:15:22,639
Seems if I just stick myself

191
00:15:22,966 --> 00:15:25,277
I'll turn into a big, strong Titan.

192
00:15:27,127 --> 00:15:30,172
One of the dumb ones, unfortunately.

193
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:36,942
But for a while, it oughtta keep me... alive.

194
00:15:45,751 --> 00:15:49,637
You had the time and strength to inject
yourself before I got here if you wanted.

195
00:15:50,812 --> 00:15:51,670
Why didn't you?

196
00:15:53,815 --> 00:15:57,089
Fair point. I guess I'm just scared.

197
00:15:58,803 --> 00:16:01,054
If I don't inject it right, then...

198
00:16:01,701 --> 00:16:06,131
I might turn out the same as Rod. All messed up-like.

199
00:16:08,278 --> 00:16:11,406
I know you're not just sitting
here waiting to bleed to death.

200
00:16:12,467 --> 00:16:14,909
Surely you have a better excuse than that.

201
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:19,827
Well, runt, the thing is, I don't feel like dyin'

202
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,869
without my dream comin' true.

203
00:16:24,068 --> 00:16:26,859
But... I see now.

204
00:16:29,128 --> 00:16:33,540
After all this time, I think I see why he did it.

205
00:16:34,793 --> 00:16:35,328
Huh?

206
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:49,080
We humans, we're all the same.

207
00:16:49,275 --> 00:16:50,875
Every last one of us.

208
00:16:52,972 --> 00:16:54,689
For some it's drinkin'.

209
00:16:55,307 --> 00:16:56,771
For some it's women.

210
00:16:57,422 --> 00:16:59,163
For some, even religion.

211
00:17:00,823 --> 00:17:03,056
Family. The king.

212
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:07,099
Dreams. Children.

213
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:09,325
Power.

214
00:17:11,214 --> 00:17:14,337
All of us had to spend our lives drunk on somethin'.

215
00:17:14,621 --> 00:17:17,133
Else we'd have no cause to keep pushin' on.

216
00:17:18,499 --> 00:17:21,925
Everyone was a slave to somethin'.

217
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:25,270
Even him.

218
00:17:34,389 --> 00:17:38,601
So. What's your poison, runt? Heroics?

219
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:41,722
Kenny.

220
00:17:42,488 --> 00:17:44,615
Tell me everything you know about the king.

221
00:17:45,185 --> 00:17:46,337
The First King.

222
00:17:46,555 --> 00:17:48,794
Why didn't he want mankind to survive?

223
00:17:49,294 --> 00:17:50,923
Don't know, beats me.

224
00:17:51,557 --> 00:17:54,879
That said, I know that's part of the reason...

225
00:17:55,042 --> 00:17:57,948
...that we Ackermanns decided to turn coat...

226
00:18:01,302 --> 00:18:04,215
So apparently, that's my name as well.

227
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:07,614
Tell me. Who are you?

228
00:18:07,809 --> 00:18:09,346
What were you to my mom?

229
00:18:09,635 --> 00:18:11,691
Heh. You dumbass.

230
00:18:12,919 --> 00:18:14,693
I'm just her brother.

231
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:25,547
That day. Why?

232
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:27,835
Why did you leave me?

233
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:40,642
Because. I just wasn't cut out... to be somebody's dad.

234
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:57,319
Kenny.

235
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:29,188
Did that girl really bring
down a Titan bigger than the wall?

236
00:19:29,232 --> 00:19:32,158
Yeah! All the people of Orvud District witnessed it!

237
00:19:32,793 --> 00:19:36,417
As small as she is, she still saved us from that Titan?

238
00:19:36,591 --> 00:19:41,024
Her father ruled as king from the shadows,
but she brought his tyranny to an end!

239
00:19:41,508 --> 00:19:44,250
Long live the true ruler of the walls!

240
00:19:44,373 --> 00:19:47,769
Long live Queen Historia!

241
00:19:47,959 --> 00:19:51,122
You need to let <i>me</i> be the one to
deal the killing blow to the Titan.

242
00:19:51,496 --> 00:19:54,817
Because then, we'll have a
story the people can get behind.

243
00:19:54,864 --> 00:19:56,857
A story to unite the walls!

244
00:19:58,773 --> 00:20:01,259
To think that she actually dealt the killing blow.

245
00:20:14,608 --> 00:20:17,428
Wait, you're actually doing it? For real?

246
00:20:17,733 --> 00:20:18,983
Yeah. I am.

247
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:21,152
Come on. It was just a joke.

248
00:20:21,991 --> 00:20:23,107
Right, Mikasa?

249
00:20:23,943 --> 00:20:26,374
After you've smacked him, you should tell him this:

250
00:20:26,643 --> 00:20:28,518
"I dare you to hit me back."

251
00:20:28,859 --> 00:20:29,948
Real helpful.

252
00:20:31,275 --> 00:20:33,579
If it's not a serious grudge, let it go.

253
00:20:33,751 --> 00:20:36,806
If I can't even do this, then
how can I call myself a queen?

254
00:20:36,989 --> 00:20:39,618
That's the spirit. Pound that runt!

255
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:56,188
Uh.

256
00:20:57,352 --> 00:20:59,001
Aaah!

257
00:21:00,526 --> 00:21:01,354
Did that hurt?

258
00:21:01,449 --> 00:21:03,324
Well I'm queen now, so too bad!

259
00:21:03,366 --> 00:21:04,418
If you have a probl...

260
00:21:07,964 --> 00:21:10,481
Thanks, you guys. I needed that.

261
00:21:22,876 --> 00:21:23,638
Reiner!

262
00:21:35,797 --> 00:21:40,536
I won. Which means that we'll wait to rescue Annie.

263
00:21:41,428 --> 00:21:44,373
Retrieving the Coordinate is our priority,

264
00:21:44,533 --> 00:21:46,097
as it should be.

265
00:21:49,159 --> 00:21:50,776
And if we wait right here,

266
00:21:50,857 --> 00:21:53,232
well, it'll come to us on its own.

267
00:23:40,739 --> 00:23:43,182
They believed themselves to be special.

268
00:23:44,411 --> 00:23:46,820
When a certain man imparts old tales,

269
00:23:47,091 --> 00:23:51,126
Eren learns more truths about his father Grisha's past.

270
00:23:51,894 --> 00:23:54,619
Next episode: "Bystander."
