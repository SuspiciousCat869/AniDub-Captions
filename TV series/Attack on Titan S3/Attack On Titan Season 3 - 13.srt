1
00:00:04,812 --> 00:00:06,138
Before it's fall,

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:10,602
Wall Maria contained a third of
what usable land remained to humanity.

3
00:00:11,537 --> 00:00:15,114
Five years ago, when humanity lost this territory,

4
00:00:15,593 --> 00:00:18,911
from behind their last two walls,
the people realized something.

5
00:00:19,729 --> 00:00:23,367
Humankind... is fated to become extinct.

6
00:00:24,854 --> 00:00:26,434
Defeat was certain.

7
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:29,692
The blade of despair pierced our hearts.

8
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,677
I'm gonna put a stop to this.

9
00:00:31,867 --> 00:00:33,306
I'll kill them all.

10
00:00:34,229 --> 00:00:36,682
Every last one.

11
00:00:37,378 --> 00:00:41,115
But then, someone grasped that blade and wrenched,

12
00:00:41,179 --> 00:00:43,069
turned sorrow to rage,

13
00:00:43,228 --> 00:00:45,063
and lashed out at the Titans,

14
00:00:45,452 --> 00:00:48,638
striking the monsters down with earth-shaking force.

15
00:00:49,618 --> 00:00:51,553
When humanity first saw this,

16
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:53,761
what was in their hearts then?

17
00:00:54,744 --> 00:00:56,797
In some, a stalwart pride.

18
00:00:57,138 --> 00:00:59,293
In others, newfound hope.

19
00:00:59,917 --> 00:01:02,853
And some beat with that first warrior's rage.

20
00:01:04,062 --> 00:01:07,254
So, if Wall Maria were taken back,

21
00:01:07,897 --> 00:01:09,597
what would the people feel then?

22
00:01:10,819 --> 00:01:13,505
Would they finally start to believe in mankind?

23
00:01:14,104 --> 00:01:16,207
In the fact that we deserve to live?

24
00:01:16,232 --> 00:01:18,646
Scouts, move out!

25
00:01:22,093 --> 00:01:25,829
Would they see at last that
our fates are for us to decide?

26
00:01:26,986 --> 00:01:29,000
Would it be enough to give them faith?

27
00:01:31,718 --> 00:01:35,584
If we could reach Wall Maria and take it back.

28
00:03:19,179 --> 00:03:20,479
Huh?

29
00:03:22,028 --> 00:03:23,284
Whoa. Steady.

30
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:24,437
Slow down.

31
00:03:24,578 --> 00:03:26,049
Make sure the ground is lit.

32
00:03:26,411 --> 00:03:27,599
Right. Sorry, sir.

33
00:03:28,104 --> 00:03:29,520
Will we get there soon?

34
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:31,110
It's just about dawn.

35
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,979
Well, once we get over this mountain,

36
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,804
Shiganshina should be close by.

37
00:03:36,592 --> 00:03:38,895
I'm sorry that you got stuck with my horse.

38
00:03:39,048 --> 00:03:40,050
Don't worry about it.

39
00:03:40,161 --> 00:03:41,733
You should be saving your energy.

40
00:03:41,844 --> 00:03:43,312
Yeah, I get it, but still.

41
00:03:43,425 --> 00:03:44,437
She's right, Eren.

42
00:03:44,593 --> 00:03:45,871
We need you at your best.

43
00:03:45,896 --> 00:03:47,874
Don't say his name, dumbass.

44
00:03:48,271 --> 00:03:49,487
Sorry, I forgot.

45
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:52,062
Act as though we're surrounded by enemies.

46
00:03:52,161 --> 00:03:53,094
Always.

47
00:03:55,437 --> 00:03:56,399
Titan on the left!

48
00:03:56,498 --> 00:03:58,813
Everyone halt! Light up the area!

49
00:04:01,104 --> 00:04:02,399
It's all right.

50
00:04:02,437 --> 00:04:03,692
Pretty sure he's asleep.

51
00:04:03,913 --> 00:04:07,134
Doesn't look like this is one of the
new types that can move around at night.

52
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,897
Well isn't that a shame?

53
00:04:10,293 --> 00:04:11,252
Leave him be.

54
00:04:17,695 --> 00:04:20,940
I can't believe we had to get
that close to notice the thing.

55
00:04:21,343 --> 00:04:23,363
Yeah, I'm with you on that point.

56
00:04:23,668 --> 00:04:24,654
But it's worth it.

57
00:04:25,159 --> 00:04:27,299
The moonless night is protecting us.

58
00:04:27,742 --> 00:04:30,533
Light from the moon is really just reflected sunlight.

59
00:04:31,252 --> 00:04:32,615
And from what we can tell,

60
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:37,557
that miniscule amount of reflected light
is all that these new Titans need to move.

61
00:04:37,994 --> 00:04:40,354
It's good that we're using the new moon's cover.

62
00:04:40,994 --> 00:04:44,318
There's no guarantee that we
won't have a repeat of before.

63
00:04:45,442 --> 00:04:46,471
For all we know,

64
00:04:46,693 --> 00:04:49,379
that sleeper might've been a moonlight Titan himself.

65
00:04:50,685 --> 00:04:52,756
Maybe we can capture one someday!

66
00:05:01,162 --> 00:05:02,225
I'm shaking.

67
00:05:03,151 --> 00:05:04,004
Why?

68
00:05:05,087 --> 00:05:06,945
What am I scared of?

69
00:05:08,309 --> 00:05:09,082
Shit.

70
00:05:09,711 --> 00:05:12,286
What if I screw this up because of my nerves?

71
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:13,803
What'll happen?

72
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:16,949
We'll never get a chance like this again.

73
00:05:17,453 --> 00:05:18,482
If we fail,

74
00:05:18,645 --> 00:05:21,303
the hopes of countless people will be crushed.

75
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:25,174
And through some twist of fate, it's all on me.

76
00:05:25,619 --> 00:05:28,565
How? How can I save humanity?

77
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:30,041
I'm useless.

78
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,614
I'm nobody.

79
00:05:33,822 --> 00:05:34,792
Are you okay?

80
00:05:35,354 --> 00:05:36,984
What's wrong? You're shaking.

81
00:05:37,645 --> 00:05:38,700
Are you scared?

82
00:05:38,809 --> 00:05:40,268
Huh? No!

83
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:41,759
Of course I'm not scared.

84
00:05:42,145 --> 00:05:43,761
But... look at your hand.

85
00:05:43,895 --> 00:05:45,422
Seems like nerves to me.

86
00:05:45,593 --> 00:05:47,814
This is just 'cause it's cold out here!

87
00:05:47,953 --> 00:05:50,055
I feel like my hand's gonna freeze off.

88
00:05:50,371 --> 00:05:51,588
Is that all it is?

89
00:05:51,787 --> 00:05:53,432
I've been shaking a bit, too.

90
00:05:53,828 --> 00:05:55,092
And I'm terrified.

91
00:05:55,968 --> 00:05:57,237
Just look at me.

92
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:03,363
I can't really tell if you've ever been afraid of Titans.

93
00:06:05,145 --> 00:06:07,589
That fear is all-consuming for most people.

94
00:06:08,312 --> 00:06:09,321
It was for me.

95
00:06:09,662 --> 00:06:11,697
The first time I saw a Titan in the flesh,

96
00:06:12,059 --> 00:06:14,049
I was so frightened I couldn't move.

97
00:06:15,078 --> 00:06:15,614
Yeah.

98
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:17,147
I was gonna die.

99
00:06:18,288 --> 00:06:21,033
Then you came and pulled me out of a Titan's mouth.

100
00:06:21,662 --> 00:06:22,933
But how did you do it?

101
00:06:23,036 --> 00:06:24,584
Where did you find the strength?

102
00:06:28,992 --> 00:06:30,352
I had a flashback...

103
00:06:31,051 --> 00:06:33,363
...to the day that you showed me your parent's book.

104
00:06:35,204 --> 00:06:36,270
Before then,

105
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:39,711
I'd never even considered the world beyond the walls.

106
00:06:40,719 --> 00:06:43,826
I would just spend my days staring up at the clouds.

107
00:06:45,924 --> 00:06:48,363
But then, I heard your story,

108
00:06:48,817 --> 00:06:50,595
and saw the look in your eyes.

109
00:06:52,151 --> 00:06:54,489
They were filled with this amazing dream.

110
00:06:54,736 --> 00:06:57,126
Like nothing I'd known for myself.

111
00:06:57,977 --> 00:07:02,060
That's the day I realized that I had never been free.

112
00:07:02,995 --> 00:07:06,311
The world was as vast as our cage was small.

113
00:07:06,617 --> 00:07:09,267
Those monsters had stolen it from us.

114
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:14,072
Once I realized that, I couldn't forgive them.

115
00:07:15,229 --> 00:07:16,702
Couldn't tell you why, but...

116
00:07:17,495 --> 00:07:19,372
...when I think of that lost freedom...

117
00:07:20,912 --> 00:07:22,175
...I feel strong.

118
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:24,241
Fearless, in a way.

119
00:07:27,135 --> 00:07:28,506
Thanks for that, Armin.

120
00:07:29,187 --> 00:07:30,239
I'm good now.

121
00:07:30,386 --> 00:07:30,945
Mm.

122
00:07:31,945 --> 00:07:32,844
Know what?

123
00:07:33,018 --> 00:07:34,345
This time next year?

124
00:07:35,143 --> 00:07:37,278
I bet we'll be looking out at the sea.

125
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,656
This area. It's familiar.

126
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:49,441
I think... we came here for firewood.

127
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,734
I see the foot of the mountain!

128
00:07:55,577 --> 00:07:57,268
There are signs of a trail ahead!

129
00:07:59,921 --> 00:08:01,868
Well, looks like we're close.

130
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:03,853
I'm pretty sure I can hear the river.

131
00:08:04,301 --> 00:08:05,308
We made it back.

132
00:08:05,627 --> 00:08:06,943
After all that's happened.

133
00:08:09,454 --> 00:08:12,712
This is the first time we've
seen it since we fled as kids.

134
00:08:14,163 --> 00:08:15,214
Our hometown.

135
00:08:15,604 --> 00:08:16,603
Shiganshina.

136
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:36,095
There could be Titans anywhere, so keep your guard up!

137
00:08:36,604 --> 00:08:38,756
This operation has officially begun!

138
00:08:38,895 --> 00:08:41,593
All troops, switch to ODM gear!

139
00:08:51,229 --> 00:08:55,313
We must seal the gate to Wall Maria
and the one to the outside world.

140
00:08:55,437 --> 00:08:59,938
With that achieved, Shiganshina will be
isolated, and we can kill the Titans inside.

141
00:09:00,437 --> 00:09:03,674
The enemy will predict this plan
and counter it by targeting Eren.

142
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:05,294
But...

143
00:09:10,127 --> 00:09:14,198
...all 100 of our soldiers will
keep their faces covered with hoods.

144
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:17,599
By the time the foe can locate Eren,

145
00:09:17,795 --> 00:09:19,588
he'll have plugged up the outer gate.

146
00:09:34,187 --> 00:09:35,219
Don't stop!

147
00:09:36,078 --> 00:09:37,850
You get to that outer gate!

148
00:09:38,395 --> 00:09:39,122
Right!

149
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,333
Ashes.

150
00:09:46,062 --> 00:09:47,470
From a kicked-out fire?

151
00:09:52,003 --> 00:09:54,605
They're here and they're close.

152
00:09:54,986 --> 00:09:56,408
Bertholdt and Reiner!

153
00:10:04,768 --> 00:10:07,014
My old house is right around here.

154
00:10:07,537 --> 00:10:09,104
We're so close...

155
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,790
...to everything we left behind.

156
00:10:18,805 --> 00:10:19,893
It's fine.

157
00:10:20,145 --> 00:10:21,674
I'm taking it back.

158
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:27,990
I know we're overdue for some luck,

159
00:10:28,104 --> 00:10:30,859
but how have we not seen any Titans yet?

160
00:10:31,351 --> 00:10:33,018
We still have to continue.

161
00:10:33,109 --> 00:10:33,869
Right.

162
00:10:34,293 --> 00:10:36,316
We have no cause to call it off.

163
00:10:43,062 --> 00:10:44,365
I can do this!

164
00:10:44,913 --> 00:10:45,629
No...

165
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:47,717
We can do this!

166
00:10:49,812 --> 00:10:51,262
Because we're special,

167
00:10:51,662 --> 00:10:54,797
for no other reason than the fact that we were born!

168
00:10:55,645 --> 00:10:57,521
We will be free!

169
00:11:48,787 --> 00:11:50,562
The enemy could strike any second!

170
00:11:50,968 --> 00:11:52,135
Stay on the lookout!

171
00:11:52,258 --> 00:11:52,659
Right!

172
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:56,401
Eren!

173
00:11:56,461 --> 00:11:58,093
Is your ODM gear secure?

174
00:11:58,992 --> 00:11:59,914
It's fine.

175
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,425
That said, I did manage to shake off my cloak.

176
00:12:09,091 --> 00:12:09,773
Thank you.

177
00:12:11,838 --> 00:12:12,847
How's it look?

178
00:12:14,303 --> 00:12:15,525
Looks good over here!

179
00:12:16,667 --> 00:12:18,624
Yeah, our end's plugged, too!

180
00:12:22,071 --> 00:12:23,954
We pulled it off. Huh.

181
00:12:24,561 --> 00:12:25,836
Eren, are you okay?

182
00:12:25,861 --> 00:12:26,910
Not even tired.

183
00:12:27,287 --> 00:12:28,816
All that training's paid off.

184
00:12:28,895 --> 00:12:30,292
We shouldn't waste time then.

185
00:12:30,703 --> 00:12:32,312
Everyone, head for the inner gate!

186
00:12:32,812 --> 00:12:34,464
And keep your faces hidden!

187
00:12:37,302 --> 00:12:39,080
Did I actually seal that gate?

188
00:12:39,276 --> 00:12:40,614
Seemed too easy.

189
00:12:41,328 --> 00:12:42,680
You did it. I saw you.

190
00:12:42,863 --> 00:12:44,880
Try to have faith in your own strength.

191
00:12:48,115 --> 00:12:49,966
I finally took it back.

192
00:12:52,979 --> 00:12:54,097
We're not finished.

193
00:12:54,581 --> 00:12:56,162
You can plug the gates all you want,

194
00:12:56,219 --> 00:12:57,974
but they can just break them again later.

195
00:12:59,151 --> 00:13:02,504
Until we've killed Reiner, Bertholdt,
and whoever else may be with them,

196
00:13:02,812 --> 00:13:05,539
the operation to retake Wall Maria won't be over.

197
00:13:05,742 --> 00:13:06,428
Yeah.

198
00:13:06,718 --> 00:13:07,834
I'm well aware.

199
00:13:10,463 --> 00:13:12,695
The outer gate was closed off successfully,

200
00:13:13,261 --> 00:13:15,192
but something feels wrong here.

201
00:13:15,825 --> 00:13:17,528
The enemy should've attacked by now.

202
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:18,768
Right, Erwin?

203
00:13:19,704 --> 00:13:21,962
So why haven't we seen a single Titan yet?

204
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:25,735
Is it possible that they just weren't ready to fight us?

205
00:13:26,593 --> 00:13:30,272
We can hope, but considering what Arlelt found...

206
00:13:32,809 --> 00:13:33,798
I looked into it.

207
00:13:34,411 --> 00:13:36,850
It's clear that someone was camping on the wall.

208
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,885
I found cups and a cold pot on the ground,

209
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,617
near where I spotted those ashes.

210
00:13:41,969 --> 00:13:44,192
They were drinking something like black tea.

211
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:47,432
What was in here?

212
00:13:47,859 --> 00:13:48,949
It smells good.

213
00:13:50,153 --> 00:13:51,528
There were three cups,

214
00:13:51,627 --> 00:13:54,027
and they all had the same black liquid in the bottom.

215
00:13:54,552 --> 00:13:57,563
So I'd say there were three
people camping up here at least.

216
00:13:57,627 --> 00:13:59,128
Wait. There's a third?

217
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:02,131
Was the pot completely cool to the touch?

218
00:14:02,329 --> 00:14:03,020
Yes.

219
00:14:03,203 --> 00:14:04,204
That's troubling.

220
00:14:04,551 --> 00:14:05,323
Agreed.

221
00:14:05,551 --> 00:14:07,311
Huh? Why's that?

222
00:14:08,204 --> 00:14:10,561
We charged here at full speed on horseback.

223
00:14:11,162 --> 00:14:12,833
Even switched to ODM gear.

224
00:14:14,078 --> 00:14:17,441
Had they noticed our approach
by sight, or perhaps by sound,

225
00:14:17,952 --> 00:14:20,150
they couldn't have had more than two minutes to react.

226
00:14:20,778 --> 00:14:23,479
But a pot over flame wouldn't
have cooled in that short of time.

227
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:28,293
They had to have known that we
were coming for five minutes or more.

228
00:14:29,351 --> 00:14:32,552
Which tells me they've had plenty
of time to prepare for our arrival.

229
00:14:32,954 --> 00:14:33,829
There's no way.

230
00:14:33,857 --> 00:14:34,888
How'd they know?

231
00:14:35,371 --> 00:14:39,527
Well, it's possible that they had a
scout in addition to the three on the wall.

232
00:14:40,162 --> 00:14:40,807
Yeah.

233
00:14:41,412 --> 00:14:44,533
We should assume we have many
enemies and that they could be anywhere.

234
00:14:44,673 --> 00:14:47,703
You need to sharpen your focus
on the enemies that are nearby.

235
00:14:48,204 --> 00:14:49,165
I trust you.

236
00:14:49,663 --> 00:14:50,954
With that mind of yours,

237
00:14:50,992 --> 00:14:53,344
you've saved us from disaster countless times.

238
00:14:54,163 --> 00:14:55,124
Now do it again.

239
00:14:55,266 --> 00:14:57,014
We're in dire need of your help.

240
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:01,090
You can take as many soldiers as you need.

241
00:15:01,426 --> 00:15:04,046
If the enemy's hiding near the inner gate, find them.

242
00:15:06,594 --> 00:15:09,846
As of now, you will obey Armin Arlelt's commands.

243
00:15:10,278 --> 00:15:11,673
He'll tell you how to proceed.

244
00:15:16,895 --> 00:15:17,512
Uh...

245
00:15:17,631 --> 00:15:18,640
Understood!

246
00:15:18,735 --> 00:15:21,032
We searched the wall's perimeter thoroughly!

247
00:15:21,063 --> 00:15:22,827
What are your instructions, Arlelt?

248
00:15:25,123 --> 00:15:27,187
We'll send one group to each side of the wall.

249
00:15:27,355 --> 00:15:29,906
Search the interiors of any buildings near the gate!

250
00:15:30,187 --> 00:15:32,790
If you find something, fire off an acoustic shell!

251
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:36,286
Does... that work for you?

252
00:15:37,635 --> 00:15:38,900
Understood!

253
00:15:43,062 --> 00:15:44,525
Another gamble of yours?

254
00:15:44,835 --> 00:15:47,003
No. Arlelt's proven himself.

255
00:15:47,586 --> 00:15:49,211
He's one of our greatest weapons.

256
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:50,380
That I know.

257
00:15:51,035 --> 00:15:53,144
Eren's on his way to plug the inner gate.

258
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:54,520
What now?

259
00:15:54,906 --> 00:15:57,365
Should we halt the operation till we find the enemy?

260
00:15:59,979 --> 00:16:00,947
We continue.

261
00:16:02,177 --> 00:16:04,849
We'll lose a prolonged campaign in enemy territory.

262
00:16:05,329 --> 00:16:08,496
To prevail, our only chance is to win a decisive battle.

263
00:16:09,662 --> 00:16:13,262
With that in mind, even if all has gone
according to the enemy's plan thus far,

264
00:16:13,287 --> 00:16:14,891
we simply have to deal with it.

265
00:16:16,135 --> 00:16:17,100
In any case,

266
00:16:17,735 --> 00:16:20,158
they aren't the only ones who are hiding something.

267
00:16:27,551 --> 00:16:28,730
What do I do?

268
00:16:29,187 --> 00:16:31,296
Eren's on his way to seal the inner gate.

269
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,386
If the enemy's here, we need
to find them before he does it.

270
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,878
Why would they have let us plug
the outer breach without a fight?

271
00:16:40,645 --> 00:16:43,405
Why can't we find them no matter how much we search?

272
00:16:44,854 --> 00:16:46,437
They knew we'd come.

273
00:16:46,854 --> 00:16:47,805
They must've!

274
00:16:48,211 --> 00:16:49,394
If this is a trap...

275
00:16:49,825 --> 00:16:51,078
If we fail here...

276
00:16:51,367 --> 00:16:53,089
...then it'll really be over for us.

277
00:16:53,852 --> 00:16:58,181
They always catch us off-guard by using
Titans and their powers in ways we can't predict.

278
00:16:58,244 --> 00:17:00,366
And they always have the advantage,

279
00:17:00,535 --> 00:17:03,538
because they know so much more about Titans than we do!

280
00:17:05,347 --> 00:17:06,263
Hold on.

281
00:17:22,937 --> 00:17:24,235
Did you find them, Arlelt?

282
00:17:24,729 --> 00:17:25,379
Where?

283
00:17:25,433 --> 00:17:26,141
The walls!

284
00:17:26,243 --> 00:17:28,031
Everyone scour the walls!

285
00:17:28,317 --> 00:17:30,384
But we already searched all around them!

286
00:17:30,447 --> 00:17:31,958
There isn't anywhere to hide on the walls!

287
00:17:31,998 --> 00:17:33,228
Check inside them!

288
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,204
Inside the walls?

289
00:17:36,276 --> 00:17:36,866
Yes!

290
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:40,061
Look for a small cavity that someone could hide out in.

291
00:17:40,236 --> 00:17:41,332
It may be covered.

292
00:17:41,396 --> 00:17:43,143
How do you know that this exists?

293
00:17:46,283 --> 00:17:47,154
It's a hunch.

294
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:51,437
Damn it! Do you have any idea
what kind of situation we're in?

295
00:17:51,687 --> 00:17:53,344
We don't have time to waste on your hunches!

296
00:17:53,369 --> 00:17:55,339
But... just think about it!

297
00:17:55,562 --> 00:17:57,341
The enemy always gets the better of us

298
00:17:57,366 --> 00:18:00,352
by using Titan powers in ways
we could never have imagined!

299
00:18:00,551 --> 00:18:03,665
If we constrain ourselves to normal tactical reasoning,

300
00:18:04,002 --> 00:18:06,708
then we'll never be able to gain the upper hand!

301
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:16,662
That's the signal to halt the mission!

302
00:18:17,035 --> 00:18:19,879
Everyone scatter and stand by on top of the wall!

303
00:18:19,904 --> 00:18:20,937
Understood!

304
00:18:23,592 --> 00:18:26,252
There are times to be strict and times to be flexible.

305
00:18:26,857 --> 00:18:28,826
Uphold the principles of your vows.

306
00:18:29,003 --> 00:18:30,383
Do what it takes to win.

307
00:18:31,246 --> 00:18:32,632
Follow the chain of command

308
00:18:32,869 --> 00:18:35,469
and keep your eyes fixed on the path to victory.

309
00:18:38,815 --> 00:18:41,539
Form two groups again and check the wall's surface!

310
00:18:41,968 --> 00:18:43,581
Start your search above the gate!

311
00:18:43,702 --> 00:18:45,049
Go! Quickly!

312
00:18:46,703 --> 00:18:47,345
Uh...

313
00:18:47,536 --> 00:18:48,305
Right!

314
00:18:56,479 --> 00:18:57,730
What are they doing?

315
00:18:58,351 --> 00:18:59,271
Is this safe?

316
00:18:59,426 --> 00:19:00,883
Feel like a sitting duck.

317
00:19:01,104 --> 00:19:04,722
I don't know, but this doesn't
seem like much of a surprise attack.

318
00:19:05,828 --> 00:19:06,801
I wonder.

319
00:19:07,123 --> 00:19:08,884
Did Armin figure something out?

320
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:21,287
A position they'll be able to react
from, no matter when Eren might appear.

321
00:19:21,886 --> 00:19:25,101
A position from which they
can see everything that happens.

322
00:19:25,322 --> 00:19:27,206
If there's a hiding spot like that,

323
00:19:27,687 --> 00:19:29,525
then it must be in the walls.

324
00:19:30,019 --> 00:19:33,696
Assuming the enemy doesn't know that
we're aware of the Titans in the wall,

325
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:36,946
they'd have every reason to think
this would take us by surprise.

326
00:19:37,213 --> 00:19:38,527
It all adds up.

327
00:19:45,203 --> 00:19:46,036
Right here!

328
00:19:46,128 --> 00:19:47,830
This part of the wall is hollow!

329
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:01,439
Reiner!

330
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:20,407
Shit!

331
00:20:20,437 --> 00:20:21,208
Captain?

332
00:20:21,447 --> 00:20:22,780
What're these guys made of?

333
00:20:22,962 --> 00:20:25,759
A blade through the neck and the bastard still won't die!

334
00:20:44,312 --> 00:20:45,748
Keep your eyes open!

335
00:20:46,262 --> 00:20:48,084
We still need to find his allies!

336
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,758
Incoming boulder!

337
00:21:25,854 --> 00:21:27,370
Get down!

338
00:21:32,567 --> 00:21:33,345
What the...?

339
00:21:33,604 --> 00:21:34,791
Looks like he missed.

340
00:21:34,937 --> 00:21:35,783
Not so.

341
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:38,048
That was a well-placed shot.

342
00:21:38,793 --> 00:21:40,321
He blocked off the entrance.

343
00:21:40,569 --> 00:21:42,140
There's no riding through it now.

344
00:21:44,301 --> 00:21:46,025
They have us all but surrounded.

345
00:21:46,293 --> 00:21:50,069
They plan to target our horses, block
our escape routes, and slaughter us.

346
00:21:50,861 --> 00:21:53,057
The enemy hopes for the same thing we do...

347
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:56,354
to end this conflict once and for all.

348
00:21:56,824 --> 00:21:58,706
It's our side or theirs now.

349
00:21:58,793 --> 00:22:03,012
We can let the Titans crush
us, or bring them crashing down.

350
00:23:42,229 --> 00:23:45,158
A massive horde of Titans attacks out of nowhere.

351
00:23:45,604 --> 00:23:47,562
As the Scout Regiment fights back,

352
00:23:47,669 --> 00:23:49,761
Eren finds an obstacle in his path.

353
00:23:50,162 --> 00:23:52,404
A former friend turned bitter foe.

354
00:23:53,062 --> 00:23:56,000
Next episode: "Thunder Spears."
