1
00:00:00,817 --> 00:00:02,722
My business with you is over!

2
00:00:03,063 --> 00:00:04,849
Why don't'cha take a look above you?

3
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:15,564
Now where are Eren and Christa?

4
00:00:16,899 --> 00:00:18,201
You can't win.

5
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:20,191
If you don't turn yourselves in,

6
00:00:20,403 --> 00:00:23,199
then every last Scout we captured will get the noose!

7
00:00:23,675 --> 00:00:26,163
I entrusted something to Commander Pyxis.

8
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,642
What happens next is out of my hands.

9
00:00:29,587 --> 00:00:33,188
It'll be your choice to make. Yours and theirs.

10
00:02:17,878 --> 00:02:19,402
That's a lot of wagons.

11
00:02:21,214 --> 00:02:22,334
What's all that about?

12
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:23,899
You mean you haven't heard yet?

13
00:02:24,098 --> 00:02:27,475
Pretty much all of the military
higher-ups are meeting inside the castle.

14
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:30,033
They're finally disbanding the Scout Regiment.

15
00:02:30,461 --> 00:02:34,401
See? They're building those
gallows to hang the commander from.

16
00:02:35,276 --> 00:02:38,302
He's probably getting his final judgement as we speak.

17
00:02:39,661 --> 00:02:42,690
When facing your enemy, you
can't just guard with a shield.

18
00:02:43,048 --> 00:02:45,081
You need a spear to dispatch the threat.

19
00:02:45,929 --> 00:02:47,630
If you disband the Scout Regiment,

20
00:02:48,035 --> 00:02:51,141
it will be akin to humanity tossing its spear aside.

21
00:02:52,175 --> 00:02:55,766
Suppose that in this very instant Wall Rose was breached.

22
00:02:57,211 --> 00:03:01,558
Once again, half of humanity would be
forced to flee. This time to Wall Sina.

23
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:07,263
But the earlier evacuation left us with
only a few more days' worth of supplies at best.

24
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:13,182
And when they run out, locals and refugees
will be forced to fight for survival.

25
00:03:14,294 --> 00:03:18,195
Wall Rose and Wall Sina. All of humanity would split.

26
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:20,428
And a civil war would quickly erupt.

27
00:03:21,461 --> 00:03:23,509
Even if the walls are not breached again,

28
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,228
Wall Rose is suffering from a perpetual shortage of food.

29
00:03:27,886 --> 00:03:30,278
It may not be Titans that breach Wall Sina.

30
00:03:31,315 --> 00:03:35,467
It's entirely possible that the
residents of Wall Rose will do it first.

31
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:42,180
Wall Maria must be reclaimed.

32
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,816
If humanity is to have any hope for the future,

33
00:03:45,023 --> 00:03:46,303
then that is the way.

34
00:03:47,289 --> 00:03:50,999
And you think that such an
undertaking requires the Scouts.

35
00:03:51,506 --> 00:03:54,843
Our duty as Scouts has ever
been to charge forth at the enemy.

36
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:58,348
Cowering in wait behind these walls will solve nothing.

37
00:03:59,777 --> 00:04:00,921
That's my belief.

38
00:04:01,127 --> 00:04:05,260
Unless you have some sort of secret plan
by which we might overcome this ordeal.

39
00:04:10,662 --> 00:04:15,486
A-hem. Commander, it seems you misunderstand what this is.

40
00:04:15,542 --> 00:04:19,975
The reason we brought you here is not
to discuss our future within the walls.

41
00:04:20,229 --> 00:04:23,391
Nor is it on account of something as simple as a murder.

42
00:04:23,812 --> 00:04:26,339
Clause Six of the Charter of Humanity.

43
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:30,701
One must never prioritize their
own gain over humanity's survival.

44
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:33,775
You've broken the most sacred of laws.

45
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:38,304
Indeed. You have refused to hand
over Eren Jaeger time and time again.

46
00:04:38,438 --> 00:04:41,577
And through this selfish action,
you've violated our charter.

47
00:04:41,863 --> 00:04:44,867
But Eren is vital for the reclamation of Wall Maria!

48
00:04:44,907 --> 00:04:47,107
That is not for the Scouts to determine!

49
00:04:47,361 --> 00:04:50,651
Eren Jaeger is a Titan whose
abilities are far from understood!

50
00:04:50,842 --> 00:04:54,218
To shelter him within our walls
is to put all of humanity at risk.

51
00:04:54,401 --> 00:04:58,716
And the very idea of allowing a single
commander to have control of him is absurd.

52
00:04:58,994 --> 00:05:03,062
As shown by the way you
maliciously schemed against the state.

53
00:05:03,173 --> 00:05:06,858
Not only did you feign his abduction
in order to conceal his whereabouts,

54
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,084
you also slew Dimo Reeves when he learned too much.

55
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:12,793
This amounts to blatant treason.

56
00:05:12,856 --> 00:05:16,256
It's not a stretch to describe
you as a threat to humanity.

57
00:05:18,172 --> 00:05:19,904
Commander Pyxis.

58
00:05:20,324 --> 00:05:25,139
The Garrison and Scout Regiments frequently
risk their lives side by side on the front lines.

59
00:05:25,235 --> 00:05:28,143
How are we to know that you aren't working together now?

60
00:05:28,429 --> 00:05:33,268
I am deeply disturbed to hear that you believe
we would align ourselves with the Scout Regiment.

61
00:05:33,434 --> 00:05:36,525
There is nothing more senseless
than humans killing each other.

62
00:05:37,105 --> 00:05:39,815
In this cramped bit of world that's been left to us,

63
00:05:39,926 --> 00:05:42,698
it would take but a single spark to engulf all.

64
00:05:43,285 --> 00:05:46,114
Just before the battle to retake Trost began

65
00:05:46,408 --> 00:05:48,680
I said as much to the men I lead,

66
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:51,365
and then sent hundreds to their deaths.

67
00:05:51,506 --> 00:05:54,140
If the Scout Regiment is that fatal spark,

68
00:05:54,267 --> 00:05:56,324
then it should be smothered at once.

69
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:03,293
Think about it. What if the Titans did manage to break
through the wall only to find next to no one inside it?

70
00:06:03,403 --> 00:06:06,089
The poor monsters might have to go hungry.

71
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,503
Ha! A-hem.

72
00:06:07,884 --> 00:06:11,514
Very well, then. Let's begin deliberations.

73
00:06:14,183 --> 00:06:17,321
Your Majesty. With your permission.

74
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:28,919
Erwin. Is this how you want it to end?

75
00:06:37,698 --> 00:06:39,558
Now then, in the king's name,

76
00:06:39,661 --> 00:06:41,504
I'll announce your final judgment.

77
00:06:41,877 --> 00:06:43,522
Commander Erwin Smith.

78
00:06:43,784 --> 00:06:48,131
You have been found guilty of violating
Clause Six of the Charter of Humanity.

79
00:06:48,425 --> 00:06:51,182
Your sentence is death.

80
00:06:52,176 --> 00:06:54,853
Your execution will be carried out at once.

81
00:06:55,155 --> 00:06:56,051
Take him.

82
00:06:59,437 --> 00:07:02,440
Erwin, is this what you wanted?

83
00:07:08,898 --> 00:07:10,567
What about your dream?

84
00:07:25,455 --> 00:07:28,808
Wall Rose has fallen! The gates have been breached!

85
00:07:32,264 --> 00:07:34,030
It was just like Wall Maria.

86
00:07:34,117 --> 00:07:39,257
The Armored and Colossal Titans appeared out of thin
air and broke through both gates in Calaneth District!

87
00:07:39,496 --> 00:07:43,619
Currently, countless refugees
are flooding this way from the East.

88
00:07:44,698 --> 00:07:46,709
Secure an evacuation route!

89
00:07:47,073 --> 00:07:51,532
Order all available Garrison troops to make
for the eastern front and defend the people!

90
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:54,178
We must get those evacuees into Wall Sina!

91
00:07:54,297 --> 00:07:57,888
Hurry and go! Saving the people is our highest priority!

92
00:07:58,316 --> 00:07:59,021
Sir!

93
00:07:59,045 --> 00:07:59,816
No, wait!

94
00:07:59,985 --> 00:08:00,723
Hm?

95
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:03,767
I want every last gate to Wall Sina closed off.

96
00:08:03,862 --> 00:08:06,929
Not a single refugee will be allowed inside this wall!

97
00:08:07,525 --> 00:08:11,150
U-Uh. But all those people.

98
00:08:11,316 --> 00:08:13,378
Everyone in Wall Rose will die.

99
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:17,526
You're commanding us to stand by
while half of humanity gets devoured?

100
00:08:17,836 --> 00:08:21,379
Like Erwin said, if we let them
in, then we'll end up in a civil war.

101
00:08:21,681 --> 00:08:24,081
The rule of law must be protected above all!

102
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:25,853
The government mustn't fail!

103
00:08:25,951 --> 00:08:29,946
Uh! We can't be sure. That's only a
possibility... there's no guarantee that w...

104
00:08:30,018 --> 00:08:32,399
It's enough that the possibility exists!

105
00:08:32,544 --> 00:08:35,628
Our authority is and must always be absolute!

106
00:08:35,658 --> 00:08:37,407
Now follow your orders!

107
00:08:37,518 --> 00:08:38,330
Mm.

108
00:08:45,002 --> 00:08:49,625
Damn it. To think that the wall would
end up getting breached at a time like this.

109
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,946
Although, there is a silver lining here.

110
00:08:52,311 --> 00:08:54,107
We've already secured the power.

111
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:56,641
Before too long, the vessel will take it

112
00:08:56,704 --> 00:08:58,540
and then our problems will end.

113
00:08:58,627 --> 00:09:03,189
Very well. This is far from ideal, but
there's no point in losing our composure here.

114
00:09:03,266 --> 00:09:06,350
We still have one wall, and
Lord Reiss should be back soon.

115
00:09:06,509 --> 00:09:09,161
Agreed. We're still safe for now.

116
00:09:11,514 --> 00:09:13,802
We have our orders. Let's get those gates closed!

117
00:09:13,905 --> 00:09:14,532
Hold on.

118
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,375
The refugees are coming now!

119
00:09:19,387 --> 00:09:22,501
Who should decide? Who has the right?

120
00:09:22,961 --> 00:09:25,216
What's taking so long? Go do your duty!

121
00:09:25,418 --> 00:09:27,695
Ignoring my orders is an act of treason!

122
00:09:30,049 --> 00:09:31,551
Then I guess I'm a traitor.

123
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:32,379
...Say what?

124
00:09:32,574 --> 00:09:33,401
...But sir.

125
00:09:33,671 --> 00:09:36,895
I can't. I am a citizen of Wall Rose.

126
00:09:37,731 --> 00:09:40,042
I refuse to shut the gates on those people!

127
00:09:40,137 --> 00:09:40,985
...You dare to d...

128
00:09:41,009 --> 00:09:42,496
...I stand with him.

129
00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:51,100
Pr-Premier Zachary.

130
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:54,930
Did you find the way they reacted surprising?

131
00:09:55,335 --> 00:09:56,948
Or was it expected?

132
00:09:57,632 --> 00:09:59,872
Surprising? Not a bit.

133
00:10:00,038 --> 00:10:02,869
Premier Zachary. What's the meaning of this?

134
00:10:03,288 --> 00:10:05,958
That report you all just heard was fabricated.

135
00:10:06,284 --> 00:10:07,937
There's no cause for alarm.

136
00:10:08,167 --> 00:10:11,916
As of this moment, there have
been no reports of any Titan attack.

137
00:10:12,099 --> 00:10:14,920
Uh! Bastard! This was all a farce?

138
00:10:15,182 --> 00:10:17,982
It wasn't his plan. It was mine.

139
00:10:18,241 --> 00:10:19,273
Pyxis?

140
00:10:19,607 --> 00:10:24,255
It would appear that most of the Interior
Police are off rounding up Scouts somewhere.

141
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:26,432
Which worked out nicely for me.

142
00:10:26,488 --> 00:10:27,735
What are you saying?

143
00:10:27,829 --> 00:10:33,614
When you asked me, I declared to you in earnest that the
Garrison Regiment is not aligned with the Survey Corps.

144
00:10:34,241 --> 00:10:36,464
But I forgot to mention something else.

145
00:10:37,172 --> 00:10:39,666
We are not aligned with <i>your</i> assembly either.

146
00:10:40,899 --> 00:10:44,640
That's right. Although I agree
with Erwin on several points,

147
00:10:44,902 --> 00:10:47,882
I was still willing to put my trust in your government,

148
00:10:48,215 --> 00:10:52,133
so long as you could prove yourselves
to be the better choice for humanity.

149
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:54,819
Because you have knowledge that we don't.

150
00:10:54,938 --> 00:10:57,561
About both the Titans and the walls.

151
00:10:59,023 --> 00:11:03,535
Had you shown that you actually gave a
damn about protecting the people you govern,

152
00:11:03,773 --> 00:11:07,491
I would have stood by and watched
as you sent Erwin to the gallows.

153
00:11:07,784 --> 00:11:13,306
In fact, depending on the choice you made,
all of us were prepared to forfeit our lives.

154
00:11:14,467 --> 00:11:18,821
However. You've made it clear
that our suspicions were correct.

155
00:11:19,472 --> 00:11:23,508
It's true that we soldiers know next to
nothing about the Titans and their powers.

156
00:11:23,874 --> 00:11:26,034
But I daresay that despite this fact,

157
00:11:26,177 --> 00:11:28,219
humanity is safer in our hands.

158
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:30,172
What? Don't be such a fool!

159
00:11:30,197 --> 00:11:33,137
Just what do you expect to accomplish by threatening us?

160
00:11:33,185 --> 00:11:35,640
You'll fail. The people will never obey you!

161
00:11:35,974 --> 00:11:38,580
The monarchy has ruled for over a hundred years.

162
00:11:38,634 --> 00:11:41,041
You would never gain the support of the nobles!

163
00:11:41,066 --> 00:11:43,887
It would appear that you've misunderstood what this is.

164
00:11:44,331 --> 00:11:46,674
You see, it's far more than a mere threat.

165
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:48,431
It's a coup d'état.

166
00:11:50,267 --> 00:11:52,070
Interior Police have been subdued.

167
00:11:52,173 --> 00:11:53,726
The capital is secured, sir.

168
00:11:53,999 --> 00:11:54,612
Well done.

169
00:11:58,188 --> 00:12:03,383
To be a soldier can sometimes mean
obeying your commander over your king.

170
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:06,450
And that's especially true when the king's a pretender.

171
00:12:06,784 --> 00:12:09,152
He'll be exposed and replaced.

172
00:12:09,866 --> 00:12:12,036
This is real? You plan to...

173
00:12:12,886 --> 00:12:16,372
Don't think for one second that
this coup has a sliver of legitimacy!

174
00:12:16,397 --> 00:12:18,691
Given the scenario you were presented with,

175
00:12:18,869 --> 00:12:20,936
your choice to close Sina's gates

176
00:12:21,047 --> 00:12:23,596
broke Clause Six of the Charter of Humanity.

177
00:12:24,423 --> 00:12:29,437
Furthermore, you installed a puppet king in
order to seize the reins of power for yourselves.

178
00:12:29,476 --> 00:12:31,255
This crime is known as treason.

179
00:12:38,812 --> 00:12:40,417
Shit! Wake up!

180
00:12:40,654 --> 00:12:42,125
What, is it dinnertime?

181
00:12:42,156 --> 00:12:44,381
Oh, shut your mouth, you stupid oaf!

182
00:12:51,364 --> 00:12:54,668
Well, Erwin. Looks like you managed to pull it off.

183
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,146
Wait. You don't seem happy.

184
00:12:58,688 --> 00:12:59,712
I'm thinking.

185
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,825
Humanity is on a new path.

186
00:13:03,144 --> 00:13:05,462
One far more dangerous than the last.

187
00:13:19,304 --> 00:13:20,008
Huh?

188
00:13:24,673 --> 00:13:27,343
And there you have it. The coup was successful.

189
00:13:27,978 --> 00:13:31,500
Premier Zachary now has full
control of the capital and government.

190
00:13:32,523 --> 00:13:34,115
For the time being at least,

191
00:13:34,201 --> 00:13:35,905
the nobles seem to be staying in line.

192
00:13:35,959 --> 00:13:38,580
Okay, but what about the incident with Mr. Reeves?

193
00:13:38,683 --> 00:13:41,909
We got a public confession out
of one of the Interior Police.

194
00:13:42,012 --> 00:13:44,847
Reeves' son Flegel really pulled through for us.

195
00:13:44,911 --> 00:13:46,707
Come on! Don't you get it yet?

196
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:49,614
The government doesn't give a shit about saving any of us!

197
00:13:50,034 --> 00:13:53,086
You can face the truth now,
or you can die wishing you had!

198
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:57,853
We have to do this! If Titans attack again,
all the things you're protecting will be gone!

199
00:13:58,903 --> 00:14:01,677
There'll be no company. Our families will die!

200
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:04,238
Let's print the truth before that happens!

201
00:14:05,999 --> 00:14:07,739
It's all written right there.

202
00:14:08,001 --> 00:14:11,490
The abuse of power. The bogus charges against the Scouts.

203
00:14:11,577 --> 00:14:14,390
And that King Fritz was both a puppet and a fraud.

204
00:14:15,073 --> 00:14:18,083
It's clear that we only acted in self-defense.

205
00:14:18,702 --> 00:14:21,499
In short, we're no longer criminals.

206
00:14:29,991 --> 00:14:32,750
That can't be. They beat us?

207
00:14:33,607 --> 00:14:35,586
Looks like Erwin's gamble paid off.

208
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:39,463
That it did. But it wasn't just Erwin who gambled.

209
00:14:39,939 --> 00:14:43,537
Many people had to make a lot
of hard choices for this to work.

210
00:14:46,714 --> 00:14:49,694
Whereas my choices got three of your people killed.

211
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:51,658
I'm sorry.

212
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:57,593
Here's the thing... the Interiors may have lost,

213
00:14:57,649 --> 00:14:58,999
but not all of them know it.

214
00:14:59,086 --> 00:15:01,477
They still have Eren, and Historia, too.

215
00:15:01,723 --> 00:15:03,336
We need to find them quickly.

216
00:15:04,677 --> 00:15:06,854
Right. I think I know where they might be.

217
00:15:07,132 --> 00:15:07,569
Hm?

218
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:11,343
Let's get there and put an end to this fight.

219
00:15:18,977 --> 00:15:21,329
Largely due to Erwin's actions,

220
00:15:21,647 --> 00:15:25,342
it was declared that the old
system of rule would be dismantled.

221
00:15:26,143 --> 00:15:30,472
Once the military had secured the capital,
they made the announcement immediately.

222
00:15:31,507 --> 00:15:36,162
The declaration was given from the very
gallows that Erwin was meant to be executed on.

223
00:15:36,924 --> 00:15:37,950
That's right.

224
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:41,733
It's exactly as Premier Zachary explained in his speech.

225
00:15:41,868 --> 00:15:45,840
Please understand that our objective
here is not to establish military rule.

226
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:49,836
We intend to replace Fritz with a
monarch born of the true royal bloodline.

227
00:15:50,026 --> 00:15:53,570
They'll be responsible for leading
humanity, and that includes us.

228
00:15:53,618 --> 00:15:55,170
I get what you're saying, but

229
00:15:55,424 --> 00:16:00,111
frankly, why should the people believe that <i>your</i>
king is any more legitimate than the one you deposed?

230
00:16:00,206 --> 00:16:02,977
I'm sure you understand that
the people are quite concerned.

231
00:16:03,358 --> 00:16:05,210
No one knows who to trust at this point.

232
00:16:08,461 --> 00:16:09,897
For the sake of humanity,

233
00:16:10,661 --> 00:16:13,394
it might've been better to let that government stand.

234
00:16:14,204 --> 00:16:16,079
Like Commander Pyxis was saying,

235
00:16:16,491 --> 00:16:20,591
they have far more knowledge than us, and
they've kept humanity going at least this far.

236
00:16:20,948 --> 00:16:24,095
Even if they would've watched as
half of the human race perished,

237
00:16:24,421 --> 00:16:26,542
it's better than letting us go extinct.

238
00:16:29,277 --> 00:16:32,374
Should I have given up? Let them take Eren?

239
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:35,632
Surrendered my life, and put my comrades at risk,

240
00:16:35,862 --> 00:16:38,102
and put my trust in their selfish wisdom?

241
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:42,251
Too late now. Instead, I endangered us all.

242
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:49,321
Your duty is as painful a burden as ever, I see.

243
00:16:49,868 --> 00:16:52,389
Perhaps death would've been easier for you.

244
00:16:54,447 --> 00:16:58,084
So tell me, why didn't you do as you just described?

245
00:16:58,790 --> 00:16:59,548
...I'm not sure...

246
00:16:59,572 --> 00:17:01,731
...Why don't I tell you my own reason?

247
00:17:02,844 --> 00:17:06,417
I've hated those arrogant bastards for a long time!

248
00:17:06,584 --> 00:17:08,253
Those self-assured pigs.

249
00:17:08,301 --> 00:17:11,384
They'd feed from gilded troughs
and pretend their shit was gold.

250
00:17:11,813 --> 00:17:14,785
Know what? I think I might grow to like them.

251
00:17:15,404 --> 00:17:18,591
Now that the day I've dreamed of has finally come to pass.

252
00:17:19,099 --> 00:17:24,452
Well, at any rate, if you hadn't done it today, I would've
given it a shot myself before I kicked the bucket.

253
00:17:24,738 --> 00:17:29,716
I honestly couldn't care less about how this
coup of ours ends up affecting the fate of humanity.

254
00:17:30,022 --> 00:17:32,611
Heh. I guess I'm quite the scoundrel, huh?

255
00:17:33,626 --> 00:17:36,528
I'm telling you this because I know that you're the same.

256
00:17:37,735 --> 00:17:40,413
You made the choice that would keep you alive.

257
00:17:40,849 --> 00:17:46,015
Some part of you decided that humanity's
fate only mattered if <i>you</i> could live to see it.

258
00:17:47,398 --> 00:17:50,853
I must be incredibly conceited to think that.

259
00:17:51,631 --> 00:17:53,434
It's your turn to answer now.

260
00:17:53,926 --> 00:17:56,651
Why did you risk it all just to bring them down?

261
00:17:59,354 --> 00:18:00,546
I've had this dream.

262
00:18:01,594 --> 00:18:02,906
Something to prove.

263
00:18:04,053 --> 00:18:05,654
Ever since I was a child.

264
00:18:17,255 --> 00:18:20,265
Hange. You said you might know where they are?

265
00:18:20,829 --> 00:18:23,196
Oh, yeah. Guess I should explain how.

266
00:18:24,022 --> 00:18:27,884
Erwin gave me this Scout report from
an investigation on Lord Reiss' land.

267
00:18:28,233 --> 00:18:33,216
It details a certain incident that
occurred five years ago on the Reiss Estate.

268
00:18:33,478 --> 00:18:34,486
Five years?

269
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:37,855
That's right. It was the day Wall Maria was breached.

270
00:18:38,443 --> 00:18:41,240
I'll summarize the most
important parts from the beginning.

271
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:44,117
So, as far as regional lords went,

272
00:18:44,385 --> 00:18:47,531
Lord Reiss was fair and well-respected by the people.

273
00:18:47,952 --> 00:18:51,981
He had five children. The most well-known
of them was his eldest daughter Frieda.

274
00:18:52,259 --> 00:18:55,302
She was a down-to-earth girl who even the peasants adored.

275
00:18:56,683 --> 00:19:00,488
But five years ago, on that night, disaster struck.

276
00:19:00,893 --> 00:19:04,313
With the fall of Wall Maria
having plunged the world into chaos,

277
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:07,766
bandits raided and set
fire to the only chapel around.

278
00:19:09,158 --> 00:19:13,559
Unfortunately for them, the entire
Reiss family had gathered there to pray.

279
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:20,328
And so, the entire family was massacred
by bandits that night... save one.

280
00:19:20,899 --> 00:19:23,935
Only Rod Reiss managed to escape with his life.

281
00:19:26,668 --> 00:19:27,977
To top it all off,

282
00:19:28,136 --> 00:19:33,501
this incident occurred just a few days before
Historia's mother was killed by the Interior Police.

283
00:19:35,582 --> 00:19:40,897
So we know that in the immediate wake of
losing his family, Rod Reiss sought out Historia.

284
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:45,576
And something tells me that it wasn't
out of a newfound paternal affection.

285
00:19:46,507 --> 00:19:48,325
Well, she is of royal blood.

286
00:19:48,737 --> 00:19:51,306
Or do you think that bloodline has some other secret?

287
00:19:51,465 --> 00:19:53,601
It's possible, but I'm not sure yet.

288
00:19:53,903 --> 00:19:58,575
What really stood out to me at least, was the
fact that large parts of the chapel were destroyed.

289
00:19:59,138 --> 00:20:00,799
The chapel was built from stone.

290
00:20:01,061 --> 00:20:03,944
It would take a lot of time and effort to destroy it.

291
00:20:04,427 --> 00:20:07,965
If it was bandits, they'd have taken
what they could and made a quick escape.

292
00:20:08,417 --> 00:20:10,651
Also, Lord Reiss was the only witness.

293
00:20:10,699 --> 00:20:12,295
No one confirmed his story.

294
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:17,411
Then Lord Reiss rebuilt the chapel with
his personal fortune almost immediately.

295
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,126
What was his rush?

296
00:20:23,799 --> 00:20:25,190
When you think about it,

297
00:20:25,602 --> 00:20:28,995
the story could only make sense
if it involved a Titan attack.

298
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,839
It may turn out that I'm jumping to conclusions,

299
00:20:32,204 --> 00:20:34,628
but it's suspicious enough to merit investigation,

300
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:36,813
and it's the only lead we have.

301
00:21:01,112 --> 00:21:02,444
What the hell?

302
00:21:12,423 --> 00:21:13,631
Before the night is over,

303
00:21:13,726 --> 00:21:16,292
Reiss' land will be crawling with our soldiers.

304
00:21:17,618 --> 00:21:20,337
Unfortunately, we can't expect him to wait that long.

305
00:21:21,464 --> 00:21:23,665
We have to get there as soon as possible.

306
00:21:24,155 --> 00:21:26,676
Before Eren ends up in someone's stomach.

307
00:21:29,528 --> 00:21:35,225
A Titan gains intelligence and the power to
transform by eating a human being with that power.

308
00:21:35,987 --> 00:21:37,776
If that's actually true...

309
00:21:38,712 --> 00:21:41,818
How and when did Eren first become a Titan?

310
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:45,124
And who did he have to eat to gain his powers?

311
00:21:51,891 --> 00:21:53,822
