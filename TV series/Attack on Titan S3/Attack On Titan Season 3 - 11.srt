1
00:01:36,601 --> 00:01:37,833
Hey!

2
00:01:37,976 --> 00:01:39,700
You get back here!

3
00:01:41,591 --> 00:01:42,846
Nice "palace."

4
00:01:43,784 --> 00:01:45,034
Don't you run from me!

5
00:01:45,059 --> 00:01:47,295
Yeah, she's not exactly regal.

6
00:01:47,609 --> 00:01:50,124
Well, it's only been two months since she was crowned.

7
00:01:51,133 --> 00:01:54,048
But it seems like she'd rather
run an orphanage than a kingdom.

8
00:01:55,701 --> 00:01:58,364
Have you heard the new name
the people came up with for her?

9
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:01,518
They call her the Cattle-Farming Goddess.

10
00:02:02,026 --> 00:02:03,804
I think it's a term of endearment.

11
00:02:04,283 --> 00:02:06,658
It's hardly the first time she's been called goddess.

12
00:02:07,287 --> 00:02:12,575
You know, if this keeps up, I bet everyone'll forget
all about the chump who plugged up the wall in Trost.

13
00:02:13,289 --> 00:02:16,952
This is part of why Historia agreed
to become Queen in the first place.

14
00:02:17,611 --> 00:02:19,336
So she could do all this.

15
00:02:19,726 --> 00:02:20,679
Do what?

16
00:02:21,143 --> 00:02:23,944
She went from the underground to the edge of the walls

17
00:02:24,056 --> 00:02:26,652
and saved all the orphans and needy she could find.

18
00:02:26,877 --> 00:02:30,537
She even got the captain into
it, since he grew up underground.

19
00:02:31,198 --> 00:02:32,738
When she sees someone crying

20
00:02:33,015 --> 00:02:34,755
and saying that no one needs them,

21
00:02:34,906 --> 00:02:36,424
she has to prove them wrong.

22
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:40,238
She told me that she needs them to be okay.

23
00:02:41,117 --> 00:02:42,748
Slacking off again, huh?

24
00:02:43,061 --> 00:02:43,787
Uh...

25
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:45,927
It's getting dark, you know!

26
00:02:47,117 --> 00:02:48,451
Power changed her.

27
00:02:48,492 --> 00:02:50,629
She reminds me of my mother now.

28
00:02:51,021 --> 00:02:52,553
Gods can be cruel.

29
00:02:54,285 --> 00:02:55,938
So you're practicing hardening.

30
00:02:56,074 --> 00:02:57,248
I hear it's going well.

31
00:02:57,409 --> 00:02:58,351
It is.

32
00:02:58,958 --> 00:03:02,411
But we need to hurry. Before they come back.

33
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,683
What would you do?

34
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,250
If you found Reiner and Bertholdt

35
00:03:08,463 --> 00:03:09,958
and had to face them again?

36
00:03:12,805 --> 00:03:16,417
I guess I'd have to kill them. No choice.

37
00:03:22,768 --> 00:03:24,498
I hope we find out soon.

38
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:28,790
About this world and how it became like this.

39
00:03:29,535 --> 00:03:31,252
After all that we've done,

40
00:03:32,317 --> 00:03:34,469
I don't wanna end up with any regrets.

41
00:03:39,641 --> 00:03:43,002
Even the kids from the underground
have been smiling lately.

42
00:03:44,393 --> 00:03:47,134
I refuse to think that this was the wrong choice.

43
00:03:48,016 --> 00:03:50,867
Yeah. You're doing good things here.

44
00:03:51,136 --> 00:03:52,319
I wasn't...

45
00:03:52,476 --> 00:03:56,572
Which is funny, considering how you
said that humanity should get wiped out.

46
00:03:56,684 --> 00:03:58,693
Oh, come on! I got carried away!

47
00:04:05,344 --> 00:04:06,217
What is it?

48
00:04:06,601 --> 00:04:07,640
Gimme those.

49
00:04:07,715 --> 00:04:08,632
Hey!

50
00:04:08,726 --> 00:04:10,856
You need to rest between experiments.

51
00:04:10,964 --> 00:04:13,025
That's true. Sorry, Mikasa.

52
00:04:13,141 --> 00:04:16,378
Hey, stop treating me like a feeble old man, will ya?

53
00:04:19,309 --> 00:04:20,866
As part of the coup de tat,

54
00:04:21,156 --> 00:04:25,220
the military had to purge people of
considerable talent from its ranks.

55
00:04:25,924 --> 00:04:31,386
But discoveries such as the glowing ore in
the underground cavern counteracted these losses.

56
00:04:33,726 --> 00:04:36,899
Also, thanks to Eren's hardening ability,

57
00:04:37,234 --> 00:04:40,840
a powerful new anti-Titan weapon was invented.

58
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:47,315
That's it.

59
00:04:47,785 --> 00:04:49,444
Jam your big head in here.

60
00:04:51,809 --> 00:04:52,998
Do it now!

61
00:04:57,018 --> 00:04:57,899
Ooh!

62
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,283
That hit right at the nape of its neck!

63
00:05:00,851 --> 00:05:02,237
This could be it!

64
00:05:06,338 --> 00:05:09,842
We did it! That's a 12-meter we crushed!

65
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,112
It worked.

66
00:05:11,702 --> 00:05:12,693
Hell yeah!

67
00:05:12,768 --> 00:05:16,285
With this baby, we can kill Titans
without putting any soldiers at risk!

68
00:05:16,393 --> 00:05:19,057
We'll hack down those bastards all day and night!

69
00:05:19,311 --> 00:05:21,998
Say hello to the Executioner from Hell!

70
00:05:22,023 --> 00:05:23,236
We did it, Eren!

71
00:05:25,934 --> 00:05:26,685
Eren?

72
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:30,672
It looks like he must've overused his Titan abilities.

73
00:05:31,428 --> 00:05:33,953
He's been doing hardening experiments for days.

74
00:05:35,143 --> 00:05:37,036
I'm sorry, Eren.

75
00:05:38,108 --> 00:05:40,396
No, there's nothing to apologize for.

76
00:05:41,055 --> 00:05:43,646
We can't slow down just 'cause we're tired, right?

77
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:45,291
I'm fine.

78
00:05:45,724 --> 00:05:47,432
Let's just make these weapons quickly,

79
00:05:47,992 --> 00:05:49,625
and then go to Shiganshina.

80
00:05:52,715 --> 00:05:54,781
That's great! We can win!

81
00:05:55,059 --> 00:05:58,063
With weapons like that, killing
Titans'll be easy as breathing!

82
00:05:58,591 --> 00:06:00,295
You're so damn excitable.

83
00:06:00,809 --> 00:06:04,297
You should know better than to be
this pumped about joining the scouts.

84
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:05,291
That reminds me.

85
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,969
Didn't Hitch try to convince you to stay an MP?

86
00:06:08,617 --> 00:06:10,424
Wait, Hitch? How come?

87
00:06:11,184 --> 00:06:12,993
Because she's a thirsty girl,

88
00:06:13,018 --> 00:06:15,111
and she thinks you're a tall glass of water.

89
00:06:15,268 --> 00:06:16,581
Can't say I follow,

90
00:06:16,851 --> 00:06:18,659
but Hitch did tell me off before,

91
00:06:18,742 --> 00:06:21,100
saying I wasn't cut out to be a real soldier.

92
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:25,352
She told me I should "stop acting
cool" and just coast along in life.

93
00:06:25,851 --> 00:06:27,687
I had thought she was better than that.

94
00:06:28,268 --> 00:06:30,197
So I told her I was wrong about her.

95
00:06:30,851 --> 00:06:31,768
Asshole.

96
00:06:31,874 --> 00:06:33,107
Are you that dumb, Marlo?

97
00:06:33,132 --> 00:06:34,767
No brain under that bowl cut.

98
00:06:34,902 --> 00:06:37,284
Calm down. He didn't say anything wrong.

99
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:38,271
Well, anyway,

100
00:06:38,392 --> 00:06:40,233
you should notice that the only people as excited as you

101
00:06:40,376 --> 00:06:43,561
are the new recruits with no real battle experience.

102
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:45,205
Gimme a break.

103
00:06:45,237 --> 00:06:47,389
Ya think you're some kinda hardened veteran now?

104
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:50,821
I know I am, compared to you at least.

105
00:06:51,143 --> 00:06:52,159
That's rude.

106
00:06:52,196 --> 00:06:54,341
We were in the 104th, same as you.

107
00:06:54,636 --> 00:06:57,241
N' besides, we're not the only ones excited.

108
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,932
Everyone in the walls is.

109
00:06:58,999 --> 00:07:01,785
We're taking Wall Maria back! We're finally winning!

110
00:07:02,773 --> 00:07:03,716
You think so?

111
00:07:05,606 --> 00:07:09,055
Well, you guys do seem a little different now.

112
00:07:09,732 --> 00:07:11,518
There's something about your faces.

113
00:07:12,309 --> 00:07:14,676
What exactly happened?

114
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:16,519
Wanna know?

115
00:07:18,851 --> 00:07:22,136
No. I'll ask some other time.

116
00:07:27,527 --> 00:07:29,295
I'm out. See ya later.

117
00:07:29,534 --> 00:07:30,835
Huh? Now?

118
00:07:31,101 --> 00:07:32,934
Tomorrow's s'posed to be a prep day,

119
00:07:33,067 --> 00:07:35,214
so I'm planning to head to my village in the morning.

120
00:07:37,027 --> 00:07:39,345
There's a chance I might find somethin' new there.

121
00:07:40,315 --> 00:07:40,934
Good night.

122
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:46,384
Think we could turn Conny's Mom back to normal someday?

123
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:49,227
I mean, it's not impossible, is it?

124
00:07:49,868 --> 00:07:53,668
Well, if our knowledge about Titans continues to improve,

125
00:07:54,326 --> 00:07:56,003
then yeah, maybe.

126
00:07:57,554 --> 00:08:00,076
You're telling us that Titans are people?

127
00:08:00,101 --> 00:08:02,192
It's just a theory, but it's possible.

128
00:08:02,723 --> 00:08:04,376
Oh, about 60 years.

129
00:08:05,148 --> 00:08:06,410
Hell on earth.

130
00:08:06,809 --> 00:08:09,445
Every day was like waking up into a nightmare.

131
00:08:10,851 --> 00:08:12,344
Like a nightmare.

132
00:08:12,474 --> 00:08:12,924
Hm?

133
00:08:13,728 --> 00:08:16,549
So much has happened that I
haven't had time to question it.

134
00:08:17,492 --> 00:08:20,298
But who do you guys think that
it is we're fighting against?

135
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:24,186
The thing is, I've always hated the Titans.

136
00:08:25,076 --> 00:08:28,746
But what if they're just people
being tormented by some nightmare?

137
00:08:30,226 --> 00:08:34,330
For a time at least, I was one of them myself.

138
00:08:34,684 --> 00:08:35,340
Eren!

139
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,456
You still have bread and soup left.

140
00:08:41,434 --> 00:08:43,887
You shouldn't be talking until you've finished your meal.

141
00:08:46,226 --> 00:08:46,883
Got it.

142
00:08:48,174 --> 00:08:50,412
You're right. Sorry.

143
00:08:50,809 --> 00:08:52,526
Get it together, Eren.

144
00:08:53,148 --> 00:08:55,234
Enough with the sad mumbling, already.

145
00:08:55,991 --> 00:08:57,585
It's all you do these days.

146
00:08:58,058 --> 00:09:00,024
You know what you should be focusing on?

147
00:09:00,351 --> 00:09:01,518
That guy you saw.

148
00:09:02,451 --> 00:09:03,878
From the memories you were given,

149
00:09:04,242 --> 00:09:06,356
when Reiss and Historia touched you.

150
00:09:06,749 --> 00:09:09,582
You said you saw a Scout that
must've known your dad, right?

151
00:09:11,893 --> 00:09:12,626
Yeah.

152
00:09:12,769 --> 00:09:16,160
I think he might've been with my dad when the wall fell.

153
00:09:18,201 --> 00:09:20,251
If he's alive, he'll know something.

154
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:22,576
He seemed so familiar.

155
00:09:22,657 --> 00:09:24,986
I can't shake the feeling that I've met him somewhere.

156
00:09:25,059 --> 00:09:27,234
Do you mean he seemed familiar to you?

157
00:09:27,434 --> 00:09:28,488
Or just your dad?

158
00:09:28,851 --> 00:09:30,006
Me, I think.

159
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:32,255
It might help to smack yourself in the head.

160
00:09:32,492 --> 00:09:33,924
Yeah, you should try that out.

161
00:09:34,118 --> 00:09:35,662
You know what else might be helpful?

162
00:09:35,821 --> 00:09:38,037
If instead of holdin' hands with Historia,

163
00:09:38,658 --> 00:09:40,708
ya got a head-butt from the Commandant.

164
00:09:40,922 --> 00:09:43,130
If that'd help me remember, I'd...

165
00:09:46,364 --> 00:09:47,375
Hey, wait.

166
00:10:01,565 --> 00:10:03,266
That's who I saw with my dad.

167
00:10:04,726 --> 00:10:06,348
It's Commandant Sadies.

168
00:10:10,052 --> 00:10:12,856
Sadies was the 12th Commander of the Scout Regiment.

169
00:10:12,976 --> 00:10:14,817
And Commander Erwin's predecessor.

170
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,947
It's been a long while since I've seen him.

171
00:10:20,917 --> 00:10:22,261
Commandant Sadies.

172
00:10:38,143 --> 00:10:40,995
What's the matter, Braus? Not gonna sit?

173
00:10:41,117 --> 00:10:43,545
No! I'm quite fine standing here, sir!

174
00:10:44,284 --> 00:10:45,309
Let's see.

175
00:10:46,034 --> 00:10:49,534
If I recall, back in the day, I'd call you in here a lot,

176
00:10:49,614 --> 00:10:51,371
when I was about to chew you out.

177
00:10:52,393 --> 00:10:54,375
It's only been a handful of months.

178
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:57,862
And yet, I barely recognize you kids.

179
00:10:58,309 --> 00:11:01,915
So Commander Sadies... Or wait, Commandant now.

180
00:11:02,574 --> 00:11:05,201
We should be prepping to recapture Wall Maria.

181
00:11:05,283 --> 00:11:06,578
But tell me:

182
00:11:06,933 --> 00:11:09,775
Why do you suppose we came to speak with you instead?

183
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:18,623
Eren.

184
00:11:19,348 --> 00:11:21,896
You look like your mother in almost every way.

185
00:11:22,993 --> 00:11:26,457
However, the daggers I see within your eyes...

186
00:11:27,049 --> 00:11:28,411
...those are your father's.

187
00:11:29,394 --> 00:11:30,485
Tell me about him!

188
00:11:30,893 --> 00:11:32,367
Tell me everything you know!

189
00:11:33,183 --> 00:11:34,639
don't know much at all.

190
00:11:34,851 --> 00:11:36,705
Not in the grand scheme of things.

191
00:11:37,257 --> 00:11:42,204
That said, I'll tell you a story
that's of no value whatsoever to humanity.

192
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:47,090
The story of my past, as nothing but a bystander.

193
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:52,118
Twenty years ago, near Wall Maria,

194
00:11:52,491 --> 00:11:55,709
I found him standing outside of the gate to Shiganshina.

195
00:11:57,767 --> 00:11:59,184
Hey, what are you doing?

196
00:11:59,323 --> 00:12:00,674
How the hell did you get here?

197
00:12:01,309 --> 00:12:02,980
Did you climb down the wall somehow?

198
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:07,372
Wait, why would any of you venture outside the walls?

199
00:12:07,851 --> 00:12:10,940
Don't tell me you're trying to fight those things.

200
00:12:11,374 --> 00:12:12,107
Huh?

201
00:12:13,893 --> 00:12:16,207
Was it the truth or a lie?

202
00:12:16,884 --> 00:12:19,901
He said he couldn't remember why he was outside the walls.

203
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:24,644
All of his memories had been lost.

204
00:12:25,038 --> 00:12:27,010
Everything aside from his name.

205
00:12:27,566 --> 00:12:28,766
Grisha Jaeger.

206
00:12:29,934 --> 00:12:33,686
Who knew it was a crime to go into
Titan territory without permission?

207
00:12:34,866 --> 00:12:36,760
I bet he's the first guy who's tried it.

208
00:12:36,785 --> 00:12:40,589
I mean, I always thought that only you
Scouts were dumb enough to go out there.

209
00:12:41,075 --> 00:12:44,849
Something tells me there's also a
law that jails idiots who drink on duty.

210
00:12:44,976 --> 00:12:46,166
Eh, Hannes?

211
00:12:46,321 --> 00:12:49,837
Ugh. Anyway, it's not like he actually hurt anybody.

212
00:12:50,132 --> 00:12:52,484
So let's just keep it to ourselves, yeah?

213
00:12:53,434 --> 00:12:54,303
Yeah.

214
00:12:56,598 --> 00:12:57,655
So, Grisha.

215
00:12:57,803 --> 00:12:59,958
Do you have any idea where you'll go from here?

216
00:13:00,268 --> 00:13:01,317
Maybe I can help.

217
00:13:02,359 --> 00:13:05,172
There is one thing I remember aside from my name.

218
00:13:06,226 --> 00:13:07,589
I was a doctor.

219
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:09,718
Introduce me to a hospital.

220
00:13:10,228 --> 00:13:11,839
I should be able to help there.

221
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,507
Huh.

222
00:13:14,018 --> 00:13:16,382
Also, do you think you could teach me?

223
00:13:16,934 --> 00:13:18,482
About this world, I mean.

224
00:13:19,684 --> 00:13:21,302
And about the Scouts, too.

225
00:13:23,059 --> 00:13:25,282
About everything inside the walls.

226
00:13:29,087 --> 00:13:31,605
He truly appeared to know nothing at all.

227
00:13:32,226 --> 00:13:35,823
Not about this world. Not about anything.

228
00:13:37,215 --> 00:13:38,048
I see.

229
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:40,643
Although there's inequality,

230
00:13:40,751 --> 00:13:42,935
life in the walls is largely peaceful.

231
00:13:43,632 --> 00:13:44,977
And if nothing else,

232
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:47,821
you aren't living in constant fear of the Titans.

233
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:49,585
That's good.

234
00:13:51,726 --> 00:13:53,113
You think so, do ya?

235
00:13:53,601 --> 00:13:55,409
That means you're just like the rest.

236
00:13:55,966 --> 00:13:56,386
Huh?

237
00:13:57,215 --> 00:13:59,023
We're trapped inside these walls.

238
00:13:59,473 --> 00:14:04,140
But as long as there's plenty of food and alcohol
to go around, most people are just fine with that.

239
00:14:04,606 --> 00:14:06,707
In their whole lives, they'll never question

240
00:14:07,326 --> 00:14:09,068
how wide the world might be.

241
00:14:10,436 --> 00:14:13,579
Is that why you risk your life
to venture outside the walls?

242
00:14:13,784 --> 00:14:15,390
To see how wide the world is?

243
00:14:16,184 --> 00:14:19,442
That's right. Does it seem foolish?

244
00:14:20,184 --> 00:14:21,531
No, quite the opposite.

245
00:14:21,941 --> 00:14:25,797
The Scouts are wiser and braver than
anyone else living within the walls.

246
00:14:26,143 --> 00:14:32,099
Their very existence is living proof that the
imagination and soul of mankind are still free.

247
00:14:32,155 --> 00:14:34,404
That's what you think? Seriously?

248
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:36,110
Yes.

249
00:14:36,743 --> 00:14:37,843
What's this, Keith?

250
00:14:38,129 --> 00:14:38,432
Huh?

251
00:14:39,809 --> 00:14:42,184
You better not be recruiting for the Scouts again.

252
00:14:42,364 --> 00:14:44,700
No. Not this time, Carla. I was just...

253
00:14:44,951 --> 00:14:45,859
Oh, no.

254
00:14:46,273 --> 00:14:48,159
I'm not really suited for that kind of work.

255
00:14:48,275 --> 00:14:50,848
It takes someone special to become a Scout.

256
00:14:51,684 --> 00:14:53,415
You have to be a chosen one.

257
00:14:54,341 --> 00:14:55,631
That's one way to put it.

258
00:15:00,393 --> 00:15:02,066
I was a chosen one.

259
00:15:02,743 --> 00:15:05,253
That was the first time anyone had told me that.

260
00:15:07,018 --> 00:15:11,275
But I knew that those walls were far too cramped for me.

261
00:15:14,853 --> 00:15:17,114
So this expedition failed as well.

262
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:20,093
When will you finish the base outside the wall?

263
00:15:20,518 --> 00:15:22,198
If only I was commander...

264
00:15:22,393 --> 00:15:23,755
I could show results.

265
00:15:25,042 --> 00:15:27,083
As idiotic as these people are,

266
00:15:27,201 --> 00:15:29,993
I'd accomplish so much that even they'd understand.

267
00:15:30,508 --> 00:15:33,766
And then everyone would have to acknowledge me.

268
00:15:38,476 --> 00:15:39,160
Grisha!

269
00:15:39,868 --> 00:15:41,711
Carla caught the plague that's going around.

270
00:15:42,053 --> 00:15:43,538
They say there's no cure, but...

271
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:45,620
Put her in the rear bed.

272
00:15:48,695 --> 00:15:50,076
Please, Dr. Jaeger.

273
00:15:50,633 --> 00:15:53,437
My mom and dad, they've gotten sick, too.

274
00:15:55,393 --> 00:15:57,489
Not to worry. I'll help everyone.

275
00:16:02,992 --> 00:16:04,838
Doctor! It's a miracle!

276
00:16:05,792 --> 00:16:07,413
My wife is well again!

277
00:16:07,957 --> 00:16:10,559
Dr. Jaeger. Thank you so much!

278
00:16:18,201 --> 00:16:19,784
Way to go! You'll do great!

279
00:16:19,809 --> 00:16:22,404
You're hereby appointed Commander of the Scout Regiment.

280
00:16:22,434 --> 00:16:23,840
Congratulations!

281
00:16:25,785 --> 00:16:28,204
Congratulations, Dr. Jaeger!

282
00:16:35,247 --> 00:16:36,760
Shit! Our base!

283
00:16:38,984 --> 00:16:41,870
It's no use! We need to retreat! Commander!

284
00:16:47,652 --> 00:16:50,165
The moron keeps leading his men straight into death.

285
00:16:50,292 --> 00:16:52,397
Yet he's the only one who always lives.

286
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:53,843
That's not quite true.

287
00:16:54,101 --> 00:16:56,504
I hear no one on Erwin's squad has died yet.

288
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:58,363
Then maybe he should be Commander.

289
00:17:00,768 --> 00:17:02,279
Someone special.

290
00:17:03,591 --> 00:17:04,879
A chosen one.

291
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:06,905
Keith?

292
00:17:17,768 --> 00:17:19,837
Carla. Who's the kid?

293
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,943
Eren. Our baby boy.

294
00:17:23,745 --> 00:17:25,811
I guess the news never made it your way.

295
00:17:26,643 --> 00:17:28,196
My husband worries about you.

296
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:31,279
Yeah. I'm sorry.

297
00:17:33,643 --> 00:17:38,299
Are you planning to keep this
up until you get yourself killed?

298
00:17:43,684 --> 00:17:45,213
I think it's time.

299
00:17:46,934 --> 00:17:51,251
Do you wanna know why most people live and
die without accomplishing a single damn thing?

300
00:17:51,492 --> 00:17:53,896
It's because they've lost their imaginations!

301
00:17:54,101 --> 00:17:56,368
They'll complacently waste their entire lives,

302
00:17:56,393 --> 00:17:59,468
unashamed of the fact that all
they'll ever add to the world is shit!

303
00:17:59,851 --> 00:18:01,795
Such people are little more than cattle!

304
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,130
They can't even comprehend greatness!

305
00:18:04,659 --> 00:18:06,665
Not even when it's right in front of them!

306
00:18:06,934 --> 00:18:09,326
So a girl who flirts with every man in sight,

307
00:18:09,351 --> 00:18:13,124
one who's good for absolutely nothing
aside from keeping people's drinks full...

308
00:18:13,851 --> 00:18:14,809
...could never...

309
00:18:18,018 --> 00:18:18,869
It's true.

310
00:18:19,867 --> 00:18:22,277
Normal people can't accomplish a thing.

311
00:18:26,434 --> 00:18:29,669
Hey, Erwin. I want you to take my command.

312
00:18:32,393 --> 00:18:34,523
Special people do exist.

313
00:18:35,768 --> 00:18:39,854
All this means... is that I was never one of them.

314
00:18:42,055 --> 00:18:43,937
It's such an obvious fact,

315
00:18:44,732 --> 00:18:46,464
so why couldn't I see it?

316
00:18:48,101 --> 00:18:50,166
Wall Maria has fallen!

317
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:53,678
Shiganshina District was demolished!

318
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:55,925
They're gonna come for Trost next!

319
00:19:03,281 --> 00:19:04,156
Keith!

320
00:19:07,434 --> 00:19:09,607
Oh, yeah. That's why.

321
00:19:11,315 --> 00:19:12,935
It's 'cause of what you said.

322
00:19:17,226 --> 00:19:17,886
Eren.

323
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:20,485
Wake up, Eren.

324
00:19:21,067 --> 00:19:22,629
Why wasn't your mother with you?

325
00:19:26,601 --> 00:19:27,506
I'm sorry.

326
00:19:28,207 --> 00:19:31,018
Mom was trapped, and a Titan came.

327
00:19:33,434 --> 00:19:34,339
It ate her.

328
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:45,781
Eren.

329
00:19:46,691 --> 00:19:49,934
You'll avenge her. You must.

330
00:19:51,851 --> 00:19:53,184
I know that you can.

331
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:55,695
Let's go.

332
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:59,324
Hold on. Where are you going?

333
00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:01,857
Please don't follow us.

334
00:20:02,726 --> 00:20:06,557
Grisha, why not avenge Carla yourself?

335
00:20:06,685 --> 00:20:07,906
I know you could do it.

336
00:20:08,531 --> 00:20:10,926
All this time, you were the one who was special.

337
00:20:11,434 --> 00:20:13,007
I know that I never was.

338
00:20:13,974 --> 00:20:16,209
But what if that boy is the same as me?

339
00:20:16,699 --> 00:20:18,633
What if he isn't a chosen one either?

340
00:20:20,215 --> 00:20:25,441
Is... Eren next? Will you curse him too now?

341
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:29,008
This child isn't like you, Keith.

342
00:20:29,768 --> 00:20:31,145
Eren is my son.

343
00:20:31,518 --> 00:20:34,816
Please don't get involved. This is a family affair.

344
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:44,404
That light.

345
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:56,059
After I found you,

346
00:20:56,523 --> 00:21:01,246
I carried your unconscious body
back to the shelter... and left.

347
00:21:04,287 --> 00:21:07,650
And that is everything I know.

348
00:21:15,601 --> 00:21:18,019
So that's it. I see.

349
00:21:21,559 --> 00:21:24,732
At least now I know the real reason you chose to resign.

350
00:21:25,216 --> 00:21:27,863
Not to atone for all the soldiers you got killed,

351
00:21:28,109 --> 00:21:31,192
but because you realized that
you're not a special snowflake.

352
00:21:31,292 --> 00:21:33,208
Just a delusional, self-centered child.

353
00:21:33,305 --> 00:21:34,680
Lay off him, Hange.

354
00:21:34,743 --> 00:21:37,326
You had no right to keep all of this to yourself,

355
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,181
just to spare your own ego.

356
00:21:39,206 --> 00:21:41,544
We pledged to give our lives and our hearts

357
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:42,951
for the good of mankind!

358
00:21:43,031 --> 00:21:44,753
Please, let it go, Commander.

359
00:21:46,295 --> 00:21:47,790
The Commandant was right.

360
00:21:48,409 --> 00:21:50,944
Just like him, I was never special.

361
00:21:51,765 --> 00:21:55,997
Looks like... I was just the son of a man who was.

362
00:21:57,434 --> 00:21:58,943
That's all there is to it.

363
00:22:01,292 --> 00:22:05,721
After I yelled at her, this is what your mother said back.

364
00:22:07,268 --> 00:22:09,242
Why should anyone have to be special?

365
00:22:13,768 --> 00:22:16,113
That just isn't the way I like to look at things.

366
00:22:17,184 --> 00:22:18,966
And when it comes to my child,

367
00:22:19,934 --> 00:22:22,246
I don't care if he grows up to be great.

368
00:22:23,351 --> 00:22:25,829
My son doesn't have to be better than anyone.

369
00:22:28,575 --> 00:22:31,055
After all, just look at him.

370
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:33,876
He's so cute.

371
00:22:37,268 --> 00:22:39,502
I think Eren's special enough already.

372
00:22:40,406 --> 00:22:44,412
For no other reason than that he was born into this world.

373
00:22:49,107 --> 00:22:52,825
And you, just like your father wanted...

374
00:22:53,518 --> 00:22:55,797
...chose to set your life ablaze,

375
00:22:56,492 --> 00:22:59,450
and let it burn to ashes outside the walls.

376
00:23:08,684 --> 00:23:13,456
I tried, but in the end, it all came to nothing.

377
00:23:14,166 --> 00:23:16,253
I couldn't change a thing.

378
00:23:18,976 --> 00:23:21,019
I'm merely a bystander.

379
00:23:40,606 --> 00:23:43,003
The night before leaving for Shiganshina,

380
00:23:43,199 --> 00:23:45,879
their sights set on the world beyond the walls,

381
00:23:46,143 --> 00:23:48,380
with hope and fear in their hearts,

382
00:23:48,585 --> 00:23:50,650
they pray for humanity's future.

383
00:23:51,351 --> 00:23:54,851
Next episode: "Night of the Battle to Retake the Wall."
