1
00:00:13,892 --> 00:00:17,149
Armin once told me that beyond the wall

2
00:00:17,378 --> 00:00:19,522
lies a great expanse of water.

3
00:00:22,683 --> 00:00:24,440
He called it the sea.

4
00:00:26,267 --> 00:00:30,041
And I always wondered... what's beyond that?

5
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:16,676
Hey, Sasha, you even try to steal any more food, and we'll
have Captain Levi chop you into bite-sized pieces. Got it?

6
00:02:16,755 --> 00:02:19,725
Who, me? I would never! Probably.

7
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:24,319
Hey! Did you guys wipe the mud
off your shoes before you came in?

8
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:26,448
Huh? Are you kidding me?

9
00:02:26,566 --> 00:02:28,832
Do you not see all this stuff we're carrying?

10
00:02:29,078 --> 00:02:33,510
You idiot. You really think an excuse
like that is gonna play with Captain Levi?

11
00:02:33,637 --> 00:02:36,973
Bad enough I had to make your bed for
you this morning, now you pull this crap?

12
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,975
Oh, shut it! Who are you, my mom now?

13
00:02:40,183 --> 00:02:40,959
We're back.

14
00:02:41,559 --> 00:02:43,477
Wait, you were chopping firewood?

15
00:02:43,971 --> 00:02:45,566
Gotta stay in shape somehow.

16
00:02:45,686 --> 00:02:47,103
You got grabbed by a Titan!

17
00:02:47,174 --> 00:02:48,668
You should be in bed recovering!

18
00:02:48,763 --> 00:02:50,233
Think you're wasting your breath.

19
00:02:50,391 --> 00:02:52,433
I caught her doing sit-ups earlier, too.

20
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:54,875
Oh, so you're a nag and a spy!

21
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:55,846
What? How the hell...

22
00:02:55,894 --> 00:02:58,697
Mikasa, you know you're only human, right?

23
00:02:58,768 --> 00:03:02,533
Funny. Almost feels like we're
back in the Cadet Corps, doesn't it?

24
00:03:02,755 --> 00:03:03,437
Mm-hmm.

25
00:03:04,308 --> 00:03:08,491
Chaos. Makes you wonder why they
chose us for this new Levi Squad.

26
00:03:09,014 --> 00:03:12,058
Protecting Eren and Historia is such an important mission.

27
00:03:12,132 --> 00:03:14,377
Because we're all so talented, I assume.

28
00:03:15,677 --> 00:03:18,755
Sasha, what did you just shove into your bag?

29
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:21,015
It's something that's definitely not bread.

30
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,274
Really? What did I tell you?

31
00:03:23,299 --> 00:03:24,049
C'mon, put it back.

32
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,775
Hey! Can we focus here?

33
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:28,308
We've gotta finish cleaning before the captain gets back!

34
00:03:28,378 --> 00:03:29,443
The bread, Sasha.

35
00:03:29,823 --> 00:03:31,019
What's all the commotion?

36
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,106
...done this now?

37
00:03:32,305 --> 00:03:34,228
You know we have to conserve our rations!

38
00:03:34,323 --> 00:03:36,357
You really think you can just keep pullin' this crap?

39
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:37,325
Well I'm sick of...!

40
00:03:45,352 --> 00:03:48,224
I am quite certain I gave you enough time.

41
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:56,119
Never mind. We can discuss your
utter failure at a later date.

42
00:03:56,723 --> 00:03:57,251
Eren.

43
00:03:57,276 --> 00:03:57,819
Huh?

44
00:03:58,177 --> 00:04:01,033
Hange is anxious to get the experiment underway.

45
00:04:01,145 --> 00:04:02,395
Right. Yes, sir.

46
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:10,459
Eren!

47
00:04:10,537 --> 00:04:12,954
What's wrong, Eren? Get up!

48
00:04:13,209 --> 00:04:16,117
The future of humanity depends on you, damn it!

49
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,055
Get up!

50
00:04:18,707 --> 00:04:22,069
Third time, and his form's changed again.

51
00:04:22,308 --> 00:04:24,214
He's not even ten meters tall,

52
00:04:24,349 --> 00:04:26,335
and some of his body lacks muscle.

53
00:04:26,621 --> 00:04:28,783
Plus, Eren's scrawny ass is hanging out.

54
00:04:28,868 --> 00:04:30,204
I can see that!

55
00:04:30,435 --> 00:04:32,954
Eren! Think you can still move?

56
00:04:33,225 --> 00:04:35,448
Give us a signal or something, will ya?

57
00:04:35,473 --> 00:04:36,226
Eren!

58
00:04:36,741 --> 00:04:37,995
Mikasa, wait up!

59
00:04:38,142 --> 00:04:40,801
Great. The brat's at it again.

60
00:04:40,938 --> 00:04:42,476
Off to the rescue.

61
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,408
She never learns, does she?

62
00:04:44,433 --> 00:04:46,802
There's no response. We're done here.

63
00:04:47,097 --> 00:04:49,310
Eren!

64
00:04:51,142 --> 00:04:54,209
Hot! Think you can ease up on the steam a little?

65
00:04:54,433 --> 00:04:57,844
Hey, be careful with him. Can't you see he's bleeding?

66
00:04:58,328 --> 00:04:59,848
You see his face, Moblit?

67
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:01,267
Sketch! Quick!

68
00:05:01,326 --> 00:05:02,373
We gotta get this!

69
00:05:02,398 --> 00:05:03,519
Section Commander!

70
00:05:03,662 --> 00:05:05,633
Have you no compassion at all?

71
00:05:11,274 --> 00:05:13,879
Um, sorry about that.

72
00:05:15,017 --> 00:05:16,952
Not the outcome we'd hoped for.

73
00:05:17,975 --> 00:05:21,576
We're still a long way from being able
to use Eren's Titan to seal the wall.

74
00:05:21,831 --> 00:05:26,486
Yes. We've known all along this would
be like grasping at proverbial straws.

75
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:30,776
The plan's strategically sound. And simple in theory.

76
00:05:31,001 --> 00:05:33,042
All we need is to get Eren there.

77
00:05:33,915 --> 00:05:37,403
This could still work, but it's going to depend on him.

78
00:05:38,469 --> 00:05:41,885
Experiment's over. All troops, withdraw at once!

79
00:05:42,011 --> 00:05:44,736
Withdrawing! Go! Make sure we weren't seen!

80
00:05:44,895 --> 00:05:45,569
Right!

81
00:05:49,177 --> 00:05:51,179
You ride back to the house with Eren.

82
00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:53,213
I'm going with Hange's group.

83
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:54,929
We're headed for Trost.

84
00:05:55,892 --> 00:05:56,574
Sir.

85
00:05:58,808 --> 00:06:00,690
You must find her with all haste.

86
00:06:01,316 --> 00:06:02,525
She is the key.

87
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,526
She may know things we understand but poorly.

88
00:06:21,001 --> 00:06:23,768
I see. Another failure, then.

89
00:06:24,754 --> 00:06:26,579
Imagine if it had worked.

90
00:06:27,117 --> 00:06:30,306
We could've plugged the hole in
Shiganshina in less than a day.

91
00:06:30,449 --> 00:06:32,260
What we need is information.

92
00:06:32,602 --> 00:06:34,598
It's not like there are books on the subject.

93
00:06:34,733 --> 00:06:36,377
That would make things too easy.

94
00:06:37,411 --> 00:06:41,087
We do have Christa... no, Historia Reiss.

95
00:06:41,392 --> 00:06:44,687
Maybe she can give us some
insight into the nature of the walls.

96
00:06:45,767 --> 00:06:49,564
I did some digging and found a
report about her life before the cadets.

97
00:06:50,461 --> 00:06:52,752
The illegitimate daughter of Lord Reiss.

98
00:06:52,923 --> 00:06:55,031
Hers was not a happy childhood.

99
00:06:56,594 --> 00:06:59,066
Lord Reiss is the key to all this somehow.

100
00:06:59,596 --> 00:07:02,936
Why would a mere regional lord
know the secrets of the walls?

101
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:12,358
Huh?

102
00:07:14,313 --> 00:07:17,410
What are you doing? You should still be in bed!

103
00:07:17,672 --> 00:07:20,846
I'm all right. I already slept a whole day.

104
00:07:21,537 --> 00:07:26,094
Besides, it's my fault the plan got
shelved, so the least I can do is help.

105
00:07:26,173 --> 00:07:29,350
No! You tried, didn't you? Don't beat yourself up.

106
00:07:30,358 --> 00:07:31,797
All I care about...

107
00:07:32,183 --> 00:07:34,745
...is getting a chance to bring down the Beast Titan.

108
00:07:35,558 --> 00:07:38,129
That hairy bastard took everything from me.

109
00:07:38,272 --> 00:07:39,686
I want it dead.

110
00:07:45,558 --> 00:07:47,787
It's about time to switch lookouts.

111
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,392
You ready?

112
00:07:54,913 --> 00:07:56,267
Must be nice.

113
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:59,728
You and the others know what you
want, even if it won't be easy to get.

114
00:08:01,589 --> 00:08:06,332
But with Ymir gone, I've lost my purpose. I
don't even know what I'm fighting for anymore.

115
00:08:06,661 --> 00:08:08,953
Saving her is something to fight for.

116
00:08:09,991 --> 00:08:11,836
Mm. Maybe.

117
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:15,484
At the time, I didn't understand what she was doing.

118
00:08:15,616 --> 00:08:17,558
I just wanted her to be safe.

119
00:08:18,493 --> 00:08:20,642
Since then, I've been thinking.

120
00:08:22,075 --> 00:08:24,775
When she left, Ymir chose her own path.

121
00:08:25,433 --> 00:08:29,652
I have no right to change that. She doesn't need me to.

122
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,920
Finally. About time you started talking again.

123
00:08:34,118 --> 00:08:34,562
Hm?

124
00:08:35,363 --> 00:08:38,241
When we got here, you told us your story,

125
00:08:38,757 --> 00:08:40,892
but then you just kept your mouth shut.

126
00:08:41,007 --> 00:08:42,611
Stopped smiling, too.

127
00:08:43,461 --> 00:08:44,851
Why should I bother?

128
00:08:45,058 --> 00:08:45,734
Huh?

129
00:08:46,536 --> 00:08:50,080
Sorry, but the sweet little
Christa you thought you knew...

130
00:08:50,173 --> 00:08:52,241
Well, that girl isn't me anymore.

131
00:08:52,985 --> 00:08:55,752
Good. I didn't really like her.

132
00:08:56,862 --> 00:08:59,518
No one's actually as nice as you pretended to be.

133
00:08:59,774 --> 00:09:02,424
It was unnatural, and, frankly, exhausting.

134
00:09:04,308 --> 00:09:05,270
Oh.

135
00:09:05,933 --> 00:09:08,637
Now, well, now you're just a normal girl.

136
00:09:09,142 --> 00:09:12,332
Stupidly honest, maybe, but still normal enough.

137
00:09:12,642 --> 00:09:15,993
Still, you don't have to decide about Ymir yet.

138
00:09:16,105 --> 00:09:18,098
There's a part of me that still thinks...

139
00:09:20,854 --> 00:09:22,665
How did I forget that?

140
00:09:23,075 --> 00:09:24,722
Hange and the others are back!

141
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:26,700
We're meeting in the main room.

142
00:09:30,741 --> 00:09:32,888
Now, what's this about?

143
00:09:34,214 --> 00:09:35,258
I'm sorry.

144
00:09:35,717 --> 00:09:36,750
Pastor Nick...

145
00:09:37,642 --> 00:09:38,633
He was murdered.

146
00:09:40,298 --> 00:09:42,844
Today. In the Trost barracks.

147
00:09:49,558 --> 00:09:50,128
Hey!

148
00:09:50,455 --> 00:09:52,521
Messing with our crime scene, Scout?

149
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:54,308
Don't get any closer.

150
00:09:54,768 --> 00:09:56,323
This isn't your jurisdiction.

151
00:09:56,493 --> 00:09:58,217
A simple robbery murder.

152
00:09:59,468 --> 00:10:01,195
There've been a string of 'em lately.

153
00:10:02,514 --> 00:10:03,847
I'm not buying it!

154
00:10:03,968 --> 00:10:05,499
His nails were torn out...

155
00:10:05,637 --> 00:10:07,429
Which unit are you in?

156
00:10:10,475 --> 00:10:12,728
Section Commander Hange, Fourth Squad.

157
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:14,761
And I'm XO Moblit Berner.

158
00:10:15,267 --> 00:10:20,759
Heh. You know, when your whole branch is garbage,
being high-ranked doesn't make you smell any sweeter.

159
00:10:21,466 --> 00:10:24,588
Listen. That man wasn't killed by a Titan.

160
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:29,546
One person killed another. This isn't Scout business.

161
00:10:31,306 --> 00:10:33,860
You're with the First Interior Squad.

162
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:40,613
Funny. What're the capital's MPs doing down here in Trost?

163
00:10:41,116 --> 00:10:42,735
What's so strange about it?

164
00:10:43,616 --> 00:10:47,778
Somebody has to get the real work done
while you people run around playing soldier.

165
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,917
Yes. You're completely right.

166
00:10:52,143 --> 00:10:54,769
I see now I'm worthless compared to you.

167
00:10:54,951 --> 00:10:57,406
Simply being in your presence is an honor.

168
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,654
Please, allow me to shake your hand!

169
00:11:00,385 --> 00:11:03,094
All right. You said it was a robbery?

170
00:11:03,731 --> 00:11:08,420
Poor Nick. I didn't realize he even
had anything that was worth stealing.

171
00:11:08,975 --> 00:11:10,254
Of course he did.

172
00:11:10,382 --> 00:11:13,813
Everybody knows the Church makes
all its little trinkets out of iron.

173
00:11:14,035 --> 00:11:18,150
Are you saying Nick was affiliated
with the Order of the Walls?

174
00:11:19,215 --> 00:11:20,755
What are you playing at?

175
00:11:21,177 --> 00:11:23,909
He was a friend of mine, that's why I rushed down here.

176
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,932
Except... I thought he was a craftsman.

177
00:11:27,199 --> 00:11:28,942
Making chairs or something.

178
00:11:29,074 --> 00:11:31,707
I even put that on his application to board here.

179
00:11:31,892 --> 00:11:32,691
Let go!

180
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:38,657
Still. I suppose this is a reminder that we
never really know people as well as we think we do.

181
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,636
Enough. Let go!

182
00:11:40,668 --> 00:11:43,671
Of course! Sorry.

183
00:11:44,267 --> 00:11:46,864
Well, then, I wish you luck with the investigation.

184
00:11:47,115 --> 00:11:50,106
When you catch the culprit, will
you tell them something for me?

185
00:11:50,933 --> 00:11:55,133
"You may feel that what you did to him
was justified, perhaps even righteous.

186
00:11:55,442 --> 00:11:59,042
Well, I don't give a single shit what your motivation was.

187
00:11:59,187 --> 00:12:02,937
I promise you, I will personally
see to it that you are tortured,

188
00:12:02,961 --> 00:12:06,686
and the horrors visited upon you will
be greater than any my friend suffered.

189
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:09,179
Yes. Far greater."

190
00:12:09,443 --> 00:12:12,144
Please pass that along.
We'll leave you to it.

191
00:12:19,267 --> 00:12:21,686
The pastor. You think they killed him?

192
00:12:21,797 --> 00:12:25,158
Yes, I do. That man's name was Djel Sannes.

193
00:12:25,255 --> 00:12:27,408
The skin on his fist was split open.

194
00:12:27,589 --> 00:12:30,768
Nick was tortured by the Interior Military Police,

195
00:12:31,267 --> 00:12:32,580
and then murdered.

196
00:12:35,683 --> 00:12:40,755
I figured the Church would want to get their hands on
Nick when they learned he was cooperating with the Scouts.

197
00:12:41,214 --> 00:12:44,664
That's why I hid his identity
and had him stay in the barracks.

198
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,596
I never imagined they would use soldiers to kill him.

199
00:12:49,217 --> 00:12:52,499
This was my fault. I should have been more careful.

200
00:12:58,142 --> 00:13:01,700
They tortured him. Presumably for information.

201
00:13:01,725 --> 00:13:04,811
Did they just want to know
what exactly he'd passed on to us?

202
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:06,273
Most likely.

203
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:09,388
But these are the Interior MPs we're dealing with,

204
00:13:09,517 --> 00:13:12,231
so you can bet there's something deeper at work here.

205
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:15,617
Now, how many nails was the good pastor missing?

206
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,339
Uh?

207
00:13:16,605 --> 00:13:18,564
How many? You saw, right?

208
00:13:18,771 --> 00:13:20,566
I only caught a glimpse of him,

209
00:13:20,908 --> 00:13:23,386
but all the nail beds I saw were empty.

210
00:13:23,616 --> 00:13:25,769
People who talk, talk after one.

211
00:13:25,975 --> 00:13:28,772
If they don't, ripping off more won't make a difference.

212
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:33,769
I'm impressed. I didn't think highly of Pastor Nick.

213
00:13:34,433 --> 00:13:37,844
But whatever his faults, he
stuck by his beliefs until the end.

214
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:46,471
Which means... they have no idea
we know about the Reiss family.

215
00:13:47,616 --> 00:13:50,563
But, the government is up to something.

216
00:13:50,756 --> 00:13:52,916
And we've got a target on our backs.

217
00:13:54,392 --> 00:13:55,759
Captain Levi, sir.

218
00:13:55,932 --> 00:13:57,816
I have a message from Commander Erwin.

219
00:13:59,808 --> 00:14:01,854
I went to tell him about Pastor Nick,

220
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,125
but he gave me this and sent me off.

221
00:14:04,756 --> 00:14:06,238
Get your gear, now!

222
00:14:06,408 --> 00:14:07,501
We're leaving.

223
00:14:07,729 --> 00:14:09,599
Make it look like we were never here.

224
00:14:16,552 --> 00:14:19,730
That was close. What if they had caught us?

225
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:21,604
Would they rip our nails off?

226
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:24,695
How did Commander Erwin know they were headed here?

227
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:27,968
The government's passed down some new orders.

228
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:31,289
There's been a freeze on all
Scout activity outside the wall.

229
00:14:32,068 --> 00:14:34,539
We're to hand over Eren and Historia.

230
00:14:35,683 --> 00:14:38,496
Captain. I didn't have time to tell you,

231
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:41,984
but some MPs came for the
commander right after I left him.

232
00:14:45,408 --> 00:14:47,378
What? Like he's some kind of criminal?

233
00:14:47,975 --> 00:14:50,405
They're bringing this fight out into the open.

234
00:14:50,868 --> 00:14:52,826
No more working from the shadows.

235
00:14:53,018 --> 00:14:56,299
They're going to protect the walls' secrets at any cost.

236
00:14:56,474 --> 00:15:00,583
But why? And what exactly are
they after Eren and Historia for?

237
00:15:00,829 --> 00:15:03,945
They don't want them dead, so what are they planning?

238
00:15:04,475 --> 00:15:05,375
Who knows?

239
00:15:06,158 --> 00:15:09,014
But they want these two and
they're not being subtle about it.

240
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:12,206
Which makes lingering here dangerous.

241
00:15:12,642 --> 00:15:14,940
We'll move Eren and Historia to Trost.

242
00:15:15,985 --> 00:15:19,549
We're taking them to the same district
where Pastor Nick was just murdered?

243
00:15:19,642 --> 00:15:21,908
Heading toward the interior would be worse.

244
00:15:22,284 --> 00:15:25,260
With Trost in a panic, it should be easy to slip in.

245
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:29,917
And if things do go all to
hell, we can use these in the city.

246
00:15:29,975 --> 00:15:31,020
That's true.

247
00:15:31,417 --> 00:15:34,126
We don't know the identity of our enemy yet.

248
00:15:34,674 --> 00:15:37,344
I have an idea of how we can change that.

249
00:15:38,323 --> 00:15:41,022
Hange, I'll need you to lend me some of your squad.

250
00:15:41,347 --> 00:15:42,276
No problem.

251
00:15:44,933 --> 00:15:47,225
All right, I'm going after Commander Erwin.

252
00:15:47,486 --> 00:15:50,808
Moblit's with me. The rest of you will go with Levi.

253
00:15:51,142 --> 00:15:51,707
Roger!

254
00:15:53,716 --> 00:15:54,534
Hange!

255
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:56,721
Here.

256
00:15:57,892 --> 00:16:01,330
I remembered a conversation between Ymir and Bertholdt.

257
00:16:01,909 --> 00:16:04,745
I wrote it down for you. It's all there.

258
00:16:05,653 --> 00:16:08,853
Thank you. I'll take a look at it later.

259
00:16:10,267 --> 00:16:11,229
Hiyah!

260
00:16:17,352 --> 00:16:19,547
Rather quick on the move, aren't they?

261
00:16:19,767 --> 00:16:23,325
Heh. The kid may be small, but he's disciplined.

262
00:16:23,408 --> 00:16:24,589
I'll give him that.

263
00:16:24,867 --> 00:16:26,577
An acquaintance of yours?

264
00:16:27,356 --> 00:16:28,683
An old one.

265
00:16:43,094 --> 00:16:44,778
Try not to walk clustered together.

266
00:16:45,032 --> 00:16:46,246
We'll stand out.

267
00:16:46,582 --> 00:16:48,805
Eren and Historia, just act normal.

268
00:16:50,267 --> 00:16:52,732
Why's the royal flag hanging everywhere?

269
00:16:52,892 --> 00:16:55,894
Today must be the anniversary of the king's coronation.

270
00:16:56,217 --> 00:16:59,038
Once a year they hand out extra rations to celebrate it.

271
00:16:59,546 --> 00:17:00,117
Oh.

272
00:17:00,172 --> 00:17:02,169
May I have your attention, please.

273
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:06,207
King Fritz has heard of the hardships in Trost.

274
00:17:06,308 --> 00:17:09,002
He is donating the royal family's reserves.

275
00:17:10,228 --> 00:17:11,369
Form a line.

276
00:17:11,475 --> 00:17:13,157
There's plenty to go around.

277
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:14,302
Oh, thank goodness!

278
00:17:14,327 --> 00:17:15,787
Long live King Fritz!

279
00:17:16,017 --> 00:17:18,456
All that food and he's just giving it away?

280
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:20,888
It's not as if he needs it all.

281
00:17:21,644 --> 00:17:24,121
Easier to control people when they're not starving.

282
00:17:30,308 --> 00:17:34,505
Handing out those rations depleted
more than 60% of the reserves.

283
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:38,216
That's a steep cost just to
raise morale a bit, Lord Reiss.

284
00:17:38,325 --> 00:17:39,454
Quite steep.

285
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:45,133
It was necessary. We had to do something to
improve the public's opinion of the royal family.

286
00:17:45,517 --> 00:17:47,992
Now we just need the other pieces of the puzzle.

287
00:17:48,135 --> 00:17:50,200
And the sooner we have them, the better.

288
00:17:51,622 --> 00:17:53,956
The Military Police failed us again?

289
00:17:54,017 --> 00:17:56,780
I'll return at once. We'll continue the hunt.

290
00:17:57,033 --> 00:17:59,655
No, we'll soon have what we need.

291
00:18:00,222 --> 00:18:01,950
Things are in motion now.

292
00:18:16,493 --> 00:18:18,295
Behind us! Look out!

293
00:18:23,775 --> 00:18:24,643
Armi...

294
00:18:25,225 --> 00:18:27,090
Uh, I mean, Christa and Eren!

295
00:18:27,183 --> 00:18:29,197
Those bastards are running off with them!

296
00:18:35,007 --> 00:18:36,903
Will it really work again?

297
00:18:38,334 --> 00:18:41,282
With that horse face of his, we look nothing alike.

298
00:18:42,106 --> 00:18:44,395
Well, Jean. Good luck.

299
00:18:49,308 --> 00:18:51,276
Yeah. So nice.

300
00:18:51,439 --> 00:18:53,423
Let me hear how much you like it.

301
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:56,012
Well? How's that?

302
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:57,847
Feels good, doesn't it?

303
00:18:58,117 --> 00:19:01,281
Come on, I'm dying to hear that sweet voice.

304
00:19:07,433 --> 00:19:10,582
This is why I didn't want to go
through this shit a second time.

305
00:19:10,933 --> 00:19:12,648
Screw being his body double.

306
00:19:12,674 --> 00:19:16,644
Just give me one little moan,
lovely. You know you want to.

307
00:19:21,283 --> 00:19:23,126
How's everything going inside?

308
00:19:23,604 --> 00:19:26,958
If we wait very much longer,
they'll see through Armin's disguise.

309
00:19:27,892 --> 00:19:29,618
He's... getting pawed at.

310
00:19:30,278 --> 00:19:31,031
I see.

311
00:19:32,433 --> 00:19:34,353
How's your leg? Any better?

312
00:19:35,725 --> 00:19:40,334
I can move well enough. Now, then. Did you notice?

313
00:19:40,892 --> 00:19:43,584
These kidnappers are obviously rank amateurs.

314
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:47,207
Why wouldn't they use professionals for a job like this?

315
00:19:48,835 --> 00:19:50,759
You can handle the rest on your own.

316
00:19:50,918 --> 00:19:52,499
I'm gonna make my way to Eren.

317
00:19:52,713 --> 00:19:55,438
Come and meet up with me when
you're done taking out the trash here.

318
00:19:56,297 --> 00:19:56,948
Yes, sir.

319
00:19:58,109 --> 00:19:59,752
There's one more thing you should know.

320
00:20:00,058 --> 00:20:01,165
Just in case.

321
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,320
Tell Armin and the others, too.

322
00:20:18,006 --> 00:20:19,381
You're sure about this?

323
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,187
These are the two we're lookin' for?

324
00:20:21,212 --> 00:20:23,917
Yeah, they fit the descriptions we were given to a tee.

325
00:20:24,735 --> 00:20:26,496
Huh? Where's the guard?

326
00:20:37,953 --> 00:20:39,114
What the hell?

327
00:20:44,673 --> 00:20:46,748
Don't even think about moving.

328
00:20:49,441 --> 00:20:51,908
Conny! Are these four really all of them?

329
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:53,357
Yeah, that's all.

330
00:20:53,892 --> 00:20:55,383
No one else in the area.

331
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:01,762
Move again and you won't like where the next shot hits.

332
00:21:01,975 --> 00:21:05,138
All right! First, we get these guys secured.

333
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:06,863
Then, we meet up with the captain.

334
00:21:06,982 --> 00:21:07,928
What do you mean?

335
00:21:08,129 --> 00:21:11,010
Those are his orders. He left a message, too.

336
00:21:11,081 --> 00:21:11,851
Huh?

337
00:21:15,093 --> 00:21:17,288
You there! Out of the way!

338
00:21:21,142 --> 00:21:21,943
Captain.

339
00:21:22,326 --> 00:21:22,992
Well?

340
00:21:23,767 --> 00:21:26,178
The road's crowded, but I've seen nothing unusual.

341
00:21:26,475 --> 00:21:31,239
It's not far to Commander Pyxis' from here, so I
think we're good, but how's the body double mission?

342
00:21:31,698 --> 00:21:33,034
A success.

343
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,647
You don't seem very pleased about that.

344
00:21:35,988 --> 00:21:36,967
I'm not.

345
00:21:38,447 --> 00:21:39,725
Something's wrong.

346
00:21:40,158 --> 00:21:42,664
Military Police can't be behind this.

347
00:21:43,075 --> 00:21:45,992
They're too careful of their reputation to use amateurs.

348
00:21:47,878 --> 00:21:49,074
This is more like...

349
00:21:50,653 --> 00:21:52,617
...they'd know the wagon would be followed.

350
00:21:54,112 --> 00:21:56,242
It's support team wouldn't be far behind.

351
00:21:56,326 --> 00:21:57,045
Captain.

352
00:21:57,814 --> 00:21:59,643
Wagon's almost on the move again.

353
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:04,266
Nifa, you've heard of Kenny the Ripper?

354
00:22:04,714 --> 00:22:06,863
That mass-murderer in the capital?

355
00:22:07,475 --> 00:22:10,319
The one who slit the throats of over a hundred MPs?

356
00:22:10,461 --> 00:22:13,537
Of course, but I always thought
he was just an urban legend.

357
00:22:14,522 --> 00:22:17,425
The stories are all true. He's no legend.

358
00:22:17,548 --> 00:22:18,088
Huh?

359
00:22:18,582 --> 00:22:21,195
I lived with him, back when I was a kid.

360
00:22:21,602 --> 00:22:23,682
Yeah. Very funny, sir.

361
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,550
This isn't really the time to be making jokes.

362
00:22:27,115 --> 00:22:30,523
That's right. He wouldn't care about using amateurs.

363
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:34,671
The team would trail the wagon from both rear angles.

364
00:22:35,017 --> 00:22:36,641
They'd choose a spot high up.

365
00:22:37,058 --> 00:22:39,016
Somewhere with a clear line of sight.

366
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:42,663
Nifa!

367
00:23:04,167 --> 00:23:06,521
Long time, Levi.

368
00:23:07,613 --> 00:23:10,065
Still a runt, or have you grown some?

369
00:23:28,308 --> 00:23:29,530
Woo-hoo!

370
00:23:29,887 --> 00:23:33,285
Nope. Don't look like you've changed much at all, boy.

371
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:37,810
Kenny!

372
00:23:40,517 --> 00:23:42,593
Kenny and Levi meet again.

373
00:23:43,116 --> 00:23:46,301
The enemy has their sights set on Eren and Historia.

374
00:23:47,241 --> 00:23:49,119
In order to get their comrades back,

375
00:23:49,475 --> 00:23:52,238
Levi and the others must take aim and shoot.

376
00:23:52,772 --> 00:23:54,897
Next episode: "Pain."
