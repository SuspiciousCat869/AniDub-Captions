1
00:01:40,936 --> 00:01:42,189
Defend him!

2
00:01:42,691 --> 00:01:45,082
To the last man if that's what it comes to!

3
00:01:45,144 --> 00:01:47,036
Eren must reach the gate!

4
00:01:47,846 --> 00:01:50,554
I don't want a single Titan anywhere near him!

5
00:01:52,436 --> 00:01:54,940
They're trying to plug up the hole with that boulder?

6
00:01:55,102 --> 00:01:56,251
That's insane!

7
00:01:56,394 --> 00:01:57,649
They're gambling everything!

8
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,675
For all they know, if Eren gets eaten,

9
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,661
then their best hope'll be gone for good.

10
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,846
His death would be a problem for us, too.

11
00:02:04,019 --> 00:02:06,215
If he goes down, I'll step in with my Titan.

12
00:02:06,467 --> 00:02:07,633
What if he doesn't?

13
00:02:07,749 --> 00:02:09,519
We risked a lot to make that hole.

14
00:02:09,647 --> 00:02:11,102
Should we really let him plug it?

15
00:02:11,173 --> 00:02:12,294
Yeah, we should.

16
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:16,536
Five years we searched for a lead like
this, and now we've finally found it.

17
00:02:17,066 --> 00:02:19,077
Reiner? Bertholdt?

18
00:02:19,874 --> 00:02:22,899
Sorry, but what were you talking about?

19
00:02:27,482 --> 00:02:29,738
You're gonna "step in with your titan"?

20
00:02:30,369 --> 00:02:32,662
And Bertholdt, you said you made that hole?

21
00:02:32,837 --> 00:02:33,695
What is this?

22
00:02:37,245 --> 00:02:39,334
Uh... Marco.

23
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:44,048
Everything you just heard was... a joke.

24
00:02:46,835 --> 00:02:48,027
Have you guys lost it?

25
00:02:48,342 --> 00:02:49,425
This isn't like you!

26
00:02:49,576 --> 00:02:50,792
Focus on the mission!

27
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:53,008
Look, there are more Titans coming!

28
00:02:53,175 --> 00:02:54,191
Let's go!

29
00:03:03,491 --> 00:03:05,211
Humans can turn into Titans.

30
00:03:05,597 --> 00:03:08,635
I know that for a fact because Eren did it.

31
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:13,983
The Colossal Titan appeared out of
nowhere, attacked Trost, and vanished.

32
00:03:14,769 --> 00:03:17,598
The best explanation is that it's someone like Eren.

33
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:20,681
The same goes for the Armored Titan.

34
00:03:21,102 --> 00:03:22,341
And if they are human,

35
00:03:22,881 --> 00:03:24,693
then maybe they're hiding among us...

36
00:03:28,864 --> 00:03:29,770
Reiner!

37
00:03:29,845 --> 00:03:31,621
Reiner! What are you doing?

38
00:03:32,727 --> 00:03:33,726
Please... no.

39
00:03:35,593 --> 00:03:36,721
Say it's a joke.

40
00:03:37,161 --> 00:03:38,549
Wish I could, Marco.

41
00:03:38,994 --> 00:03:41,733
Problem is, you're too damn sharp for that to fool you.

42
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:44,602
Somebody help...!

43
00:03:49,265 --> 00:03:51,300
Annie! You gotta help me!

44
00:03:52,635 --> 00:03:53,865
What's going on here?

45
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:55,344
Reiner's acting crazy!

46
00:03:55,424 --> 00:03:56,449
Get him off me!

47
00:03:57,035 --> 00:03:58,801
He heard me and Bertholdt talking.

48
00:03:58,943 --> 00:04:00,841
If we let him live, he'll expose us.

49
00:04:03,304 --> 00:04:04,472
You shitheads.

50
00:04:04,551 --> 00:04:05,433
What the hell?

51
00:04:09,096 --> 00:04:11,354
A Titan! It's coming this way!

52
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:16,206
Annie! Take off Marco's ODM gear!

53
00:04:16,859 --> 00:04:17,476
Huh?

54
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,156
Do it now!

55
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,254
Wait, why should I have to?

56
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,919
Back there, you risked your life to save Conny.

57
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:27,769
I saw you.

58
00:04:28,714 --> 00:04:30,644
Why'd you put yourself in danger for him?

59
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,848
Seems to me you're becoming sympathetic towards the enemy.

60
00:04:35,327 --> 00:04:38,185
You wanna convince me I'm wrong,
then now's the time to do it!

61
00:04:38,703 --> 00:04:39,964
Think of your father.

62
00:04:40,186 --> 00:04:41,887
He's waiting for you to come home.

63
00:04:42,109 --> 00:04:44,913
If you and he are any different
than the filth within these walls,

64
00:04:44,938 --> 00:04:46,449
then prove it, here and now!

65
00:04:46,474 --> 00:04:48,593
Hey! It's almost on top of us!

66
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:49,459
Annie!

67
00:04:54,965 --> 00:04:56,181
What're you doing?

68
00:04:56,227 --> 00:04:58,302
Annie! I thought we were comrades!

69
00:04:58,381 --> 00:04:59,581
Please! Please!

70
00:04:59,637 --> 00:05:01,083
I don't wanna die here!

71
00:05:01,409 --> 00:05:02,918
Don't kill me!

72
00:05:05,317 --> 00:05:06,676
You did well, Annie.

73
00:05:07,506 --> 00:05:09,419
This is what makes us warriors.

74
00:05:11,555 --> 00:05:13,500
Reiner. Do we move out?

75
00:05:13,568 --> 00:05:14,469
Not yet.

76
00:05:14,536 --> 00:05:16,414
We have to let them gather up first.

77
00:05:17,122 --> 00:05:17,916
I see.

78
00:05:18,757 --> 00:05:21,228
They waited 'cause they want the Titans to win.

79
00:05:26,336 --> 00:05:27,314
Just wait.

80
00:05:27,882 --> 00:05:29,119
Why do this?

81
00:05:30,156 --> 00:05:32,455
Why are you in such a hurry to kill me?

82
00:05:34,425 --> 00:05:35,550
I don't get it.

83
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:36,602
How come?

84
00:05:37,977 --> 00:05:40,289
Why aren't you even willing to talk to me?

85
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,894
Why?!

86
00:05:59,588 --> 00:06:01,582
Hey. Why...?

87
00:06:02,084 --> 00:06:02,717
Huh?

88
00:06:07,474 --> 00:06:11,231
Why is Marco... being devoured?

89
00:06:17,069 --> 00:06:18,166
Like I said.

90
00:06:19,032 --> 00:06:20,980
I'm sure Annie's doing fine.

91
00:06:21,516 --> 00:06:23,347
She's certainly isn't getting tortured.

92
00:06:24,661 --> 00:06:27,398
Calm down and consider how unlikely that sounds.

93
00:06:27,994 --> 00:06:29,566
If they so much as scratch her,

94
00:06:29,844 --> 00:06:33,349
she'll turn into a monster that
can take on an army all by itself.

95
00:06:33,715 --> 00:06:36,170
Don't forget, this is Annie we're talking about here.

96
00:06:36,675 --> 00:06:40,118
I bet she's hiding somewhere,
practicing her kicks and what not.

97
00:06:40,277 --> 00:06:41,096
She's fine.

98
00:06:41,272 --> 00:06:44,633
Still, there's no doubt that her identity was revealed.

99
00:06:45,008 --> 00:06:46,214
Annie's smart, but...

100
00:06:47,946 --> 00:06:50,217
It doesn't sound like you're fully committed.

101
00:06:51,352 --> 00:06:52,744
The hell's your problem?

102
00:06:52,885 --> 00:06:55,260
I thought that all three of us came to an agreement.

103
00:06:55,316 --> 00:06:57,516
Did I go to all that trouble for nothing?

104
00:06:59,233 --> 00:07:01,124
We can fight again if you want to.

105
00:07:01,227 --> 00:07:01,951
That said,

106
00:07:02,535 --> 00:07:04,264
the next time that you lose to me,

107
00:07:04,782 --> 00:07:07,323
I'll make you give up your armor to another warrior.

108
00:07:07,501 --> 00:07:08,459
What? No.

109
00:07:08,538 --> 00:07:09,746
I'll do as you tell me to.

110
00:07:10,411 --> 00:07:12,131
Then pull yourselves together.

111
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:14,658
We have one objective.

112
00:07:15,215 --> 00:07:16,501
Recover the Coordinate.

113
00:07:16,961 --> 00:07:20,274
Do that, and we can bring this cursed history to an end.

114
00:07:21,922 --> 00:07:23,794
It's gone on too long.

115
00:07:26,105 --> 00:07:28,108
We can be the ones to end this.

116
00:07:28,222 --> 00:07:29,504
So let's do it.

117
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:32,445
Understood, sir.

118
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:33,915
Till this is done,

119
00:07:34,116 --> 00:07:35,862
I will keep Annie out of my head.

120
00:07:36,328 --> 00:07:37,594
This is a living hell,

121
00:07:37,756 --> 00:07:39,691
but we shouldn't put anyone else through it.

122
00:07:41,595 --> 00:07:42,314
You're right.

123
00:07:46,876 --> 00:07:48,176
This needs to end.

124
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:51,146
It's settled then.

125
00:07:54,947 --> 00:07:56,358
War Chief Zeke.

126
00:07:58,785 --> 00:08:00,735
Enemy forces are approaching.

127
00:08:01,274 --> 00:08:02,881
They're at the foot of the mountain.

128
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,030
My brave warriors.

129
00:08:09,494 --> 00:08:10,968
With this final battle,

130
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:13,845
we'll finish our mission once and for all.

131
00:08:17,102 --> 00:08:18,700
Hot!

132
00:08:24,857 --> 00:08:25,561
Ready?

133
00:08:25,644 --> 00:08:26,366
Yeah.

134
00:08:31,315 --> 00:08:32,063
Bertholdt.

135
00:08:32,815 --> 00:08:34,224
I've told you this plenty,

136
00:08:35,027 --> 00:08:37,036
but you and I'll be in separate positions,

137
00:08:37,259 --> 00:08:39,436
so try thinking on your own for once, all right?

138
00:08:40,009 --> 00:08:41,574
Uh, right.

139
00:08:42,211 --> 00:08:44,173
You don't always have to wait for my signal.

140
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,293
Yeah. I know that.

141
00:08:47,245 --> 00:08:50,545
You're supposed to have the most
powerful ability out of all of us,

142
00:08:50,811 --> 00:08:52,888
but you never use it unless your told.

143
00:08:53,883 --> 00:08:56,231
Honestly, I never saw you as reliable.

144
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:58,498
I know that, too.

145
00:08:59,331 --> 00:09:00,611
Not until today.

146
00:09:03,232 --> 00:09:05,234
We're gonna finish this here, yeah?

147
00:09:06,703 --> 00:09:07,672
That's right.

148
00:09:08,225 --> 00:09:10,239
And there's nothing they can do to stop us.

149
00:09:13,036 --> 00:09:15,776
Hold onto that attitude until
you're back with your beloved.

150
00:09:16,202 --> 00:09:18,577
Huh? I-I don't know what you're talking about.

151
00:09:18,661 --> 00:09:23,237
Annie's pretty cold, but save her from a
dungeon and she just might see you with new eyes.

152
00:09:23,713 --> 00:09:25,374
Hell, if you play your cards right,

153
00:09:25,786 --> 00:09:27,455
she might mistake you for a knight.

154
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,863
Oh, and as for Christa.

155
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,518
We're gonna save her no matter what.

156
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,655
That's the promise we made Ymir.

157
00:09:35,988 --> 00:09:37,952
Yeah. We'll find a way.

158
00:09:40,311 --> 00:09:41,129
I'll see ya.

159
00:09:41,702 --> 00:09:43,119
Don't let me down, 'kay?

160
00:09:43,206 --> 00:09:44,434
I've got your back.

161
00:09:55,457 --> 00:09:57,943
It's been a while since I heard Reiner transform,

162
00:09:58,495 --> 00:09:59,921
but he still hasn't signaled.

163
00:10:00,251 --> 00:10:01,063
Why?

164
00:10:01,472 --> 00:10:03,033
Did something go wrong out there?

165
00:10:05,054 --> 00:10:06,592
We did it!

166
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,701
We blew that bastard's head off!
The Armored Titan just bit the dust!

167
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:16,185
Ha... ha... We pulled it off.

168
00:10:16,606 --> 00:10:19,116
You were a serious pain in the ass for us.

169
00:10:19,674 --> 00:10:21,841
Serves you right! You scumbag!

170
00:10:30,198 --> 00:10:31,946
What the hell are you crying for?

171
00:10:32,019 --> 00:10:33,161
Stop! Get up!

172
00:10:33,209 --> 00:10:34,823
We still have work to do!

173
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:37,889
Don't cry for him!

174
00:10:37,914 --> 00:10:39,733
He would've done the same thing to us!

175
00:10:43,872 --> 00:10:45,102
This isn't over!

176
00:10:45,239 --> 00:10:47,678
We'll hit him with another volley just to be sure.

177
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:53,659
You okay?

178
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:55,431
I guess so.

179
00:10:55,975 --> 00:10:57,862
It's not like we could negotiate.

180
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:00,911
Their side has the knowledge.

181
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:03,598
They make us look just as ignorant as we are weak.

182
00:11:04,703 --> 00:11:08,810
We don't have the ability to capture
someone who can turn into a Titan on a whim.

183
00:11:09,631 --> 00:11:12,481
Which means... there was nothing we could do.

184
00:11:31,394 --> 00:11:32,200
Was that...?

185
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:38,547
That's the signal! It's time!

186
00:11:46,952 --> 00:11:48,369
Use your Thunder Spears!

187
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:51,418
If we want him dead, we'll have to destroy his whole body!

188
00:11:52,494 --> 00:11:54,009
That scream just now...

189
00:11:54,664 --> 00:11:55,901
Was it for Bertholdt?

190
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:01,119
Hange, wait!

191
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,883
We need to fall back for now!

192
00:12:03,535 --> 00:12:04,619
See that barrel?

193
00:12:04,646 --> 00:12:06,403
I'm sure Bertholdt's inside!

194
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,811
If he transforms, we're done for!

195
00:12:08,983 --> 00:12:11,020
C'mon, Reiner! Hang in there!

196
00:12:11,133 --> 00:12:12,100
I'm coming!

197
00:12:22,561 --> 00:12:23,604
They got us.

198
00:12:24,151 --> 00:12:25,097
Shit!

199
00:12:25,151 --> 00:12:27,187
Everyone, move away from the Armored Titan!

200
00:12:27,283 --> 00:12:30,016
The Colossal Titan is falling towards us right now!

201
00:12:33,561 --> 00:12:34,337
No.

202
00:12:34,633 --> 00:12:36,173
Even at this distance...

203
00:12:36,944 --> 00:12:38,986
...we'll all be caught in the blast!

204
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:44,293
Ground's pretty close.

205
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,699
It's now or never.

206
00:12:45,972 --> 00:12:47,709
I'll blow this whole place to hell!

207
00:12:59,858 --> 00:13:02,327
Reiner!

208
00:13:07,474 --> 00:13:08,055
Are you...?

209
00:13:10,597 --> 00:13:11,423
No way.

210
00:13:17,717 --> 00:13:18,472
What the...?

211
00:13:19,021 --> 00:13:20,110
He's still alive!

212
00:13:20,836 --> 00:13:24,064
He must have transferred his consciousness
throughout his entire nervous system.

213
00:13:26,635 --> 00:13:27,894
We talked about it,

214
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:29,833
but only as a last resort.

215
00:13:30,058 --> 00:13:32,345
To think that he would actually need to.

216
00:13:34,024 --> 00:13:36,246
It's hard to believe they cornered you like this.

217
00:13:36,933 --> 00:13:37,874
Damn it.

218
00:13:42,292 --> 00:13:43,046
Reiner.

219
00:13:43,443 --> 00:13:45,327
I need you to do something for me.

220
00:13:45,702 --> 00:13:47,812
You're gonna have to move just a little bit.

221
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,038
And if you can't, then I'm sorry.

222
00:13:51,531 --> 00:13:52,992
Prepare for the worst.

223
00:13:58,566 --> 00:14:00,062
I'm ending this war.

224
00:14:03,624 --> 00:14:04,536
Here we go.

225
00:14:04,649 --> 00:14:07,929
Our mission's primary objective
just fell straight into our laps.

226
00:14:08,198 --> 00:14:09,914
You could call this a stroke of luck.

227
00:14:10,718 --> 00:14:11,577
Hey! Look!

228
00:14:11,727 --> 00:14:13,110
Someone's coming our way!

229
00:14:13,372 --> 00:14:14,387
It's Bertholdt!

230
00:14:15,619 --> 00:14:17,240
The plan is as follows!

231
00:14:17,391 --> 00:14:19,434
Armin, you take command of Levi Squad.

232
00:14:19,513 --> 00:14:20,411
Protect Eren!

233
00:14:20,491 --> 00:14:21,872
Everyone else should come with me.

234
00:14:21,897 --> 00:14:23,795
We've got two targets to eliminate!

235
00:14:23,869 --> 00:14:24,668
Right!

236
00:14:27,502 --> 00:14:28,355
Hold on!

237
00:14:28,893 --> 00:14:29,857
What? Why?

238
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:32,479
This is the only chance we'll get to negotiate!

239
00:14:38,112 --> 00:14:39,551
Stop, Bertholdt!

240
00:14:39,646 --> 00:14:41,044
Just wait a minute!

241
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:46,534
Armin.

242
00:14:47,274 --> 00:14:49,482
What are you trying to achieve?

243
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,977
We don't have to fight!

244
00:14:53,171 --> 00:14:54,805
Let's talk this over!

245
00:14:59,067 --> 00:15:00,668
If I agree to talk,

246
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,528
would you all be willing to lay down and die?

247
00:15:04,616 --> 00:15:06,961
We only want two simple things!

248
00:15:07,285 --> 00:15:10,749
Eren Jaeger, and the death of everyone in the walls!

249
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:13,951
That's the harsh truth of our situation.

250
00:15:14,383 --> 00:15:15,413
Understand?

251
00:15:15,869 --> 00:15:18,563
All of your fates have been decided!

252
00:15:19,053 --> 00:15:22,057
What? And who is it that decided that?

253
00:15:23,064 --> 00:15:23,718
I did.

254
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,817
What was that?

255
00:15:26,984 --> 00:15:28,533
It was me, Armin!

256
00:15:28,732 --> 00:15:31,377
I decided your lives should end here and now!

257
00:15:33,173 --> 00:15:35,159
That's a real shame, Bertholdt.

258
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:36,621
See, I was hoping

259
00:15:36,646 --> 00:15:39,290
I'd finally get to stop hearing Annie scream!

260
00:15:41,688 --> 00:15:45,955
There's only one person who can save her
from the savages in the Military Police,

261
00:15:46,002 --> 00:15:47,100
and that's you!

262
00:15:47,362 --> 00:15:49,669
If you don't, she'll be fed to the pigs!

263
00:15:49,847 --> 00:15:50,938
Fine by me!

264
00:15:53,144 --> 00:15:55,117
Let them feed Annie to the pigs!

265
00:15:55,307 --> 00:15:57,238
If they actually have her, that is!

266
00:15:58,399 --> 00:15:59,646
What's the rush, Armin?

267
00:15:59,913 --> 00:16:01,139
Didn't you wanna "talk"?

268
00:16:05,366 --> 00:16:07,327
Bet you thought that by bringing up Annie,

269
00:16:07,407 --> 00:16:09,631
you could make me lose my cool, like last time.

270
00:16:10,004 --> 00:16:12,536
You thought I was still the timid fool you once knew,

271
00:16:12,664 --> 00:16:15,033
and that you could trick me into letting my guard down!

272
00:16:17,654 --> 00:16:18,649
Stay back, Eren.

273
00:16:18,847 --> 00:16:19,977
You get it, don't you?

274
00:16:20,786 --> 00:16:22,941
Your chances of beating him are damn slim.

275
00:16:23,591 --> 00:16:25,180
This isn't your fight yet.

276
00:16:25,894 --> 00:16:26,815
Shit.

277
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:29,072
Armin, why?

278
00:16:29,641 --> 00:16:30,947
I know what this is.

279
00:16:31,245 --> 00:16:32,997
You're just buying time, aren't you?

280
00:16:33,603 --> 00:16:35,499
Half your comrades'll surround me.

281
00:16:36,285 --> 00:16:39,362
And while I'm distracted, the
rest'll go and finish killing Reiner.

282
00:16:40,495 --> 00:16:41,840
I can tell I'm right.

283
00:16:41,999 --> 00:16:43,540
Look at the way you're shaking.

284
00:16:43,826 --> 00:16:46,067
You're scared outta your mind, aren't you?

285
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:50,610
If you knew that much, then why're
you talking to me in the first place?

286
00:16:52,827 --> 00:16:54,337
Because I needed to know...

287
00:16:55,327 --> 00:16:57,284
...if when I faced all of you this time,

288
00:16:57,571 --> 00:17:01,249
I'd start crying and beg you
to put me out of my misery again.

289
00:17:03,133 --> 00:17:03,799
But...

290
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:07,375
...it seems like I'm fine now.

291
00:17:09,187 --> 00:17:11,181
You'll always be my dear comrades,

292
00:17:11,424 --> 00:17:13,111
right up until I've killed you.

293
00:17:14,681 --> 00:17:15,573
But why?

294
00:17:16,114 --> 00:17:18,853
Do you actually believe that we're the spawn of the devil?

295
00:17:19,494 --> 00:17:20,212
No.

296
00:17:20,558 --> 00:17:22,318
None of you did anything wrong.

297
00:17:22,691 --> 00:17:24,217
I know you aren't devils.

298
00:17:24,744 --> 00:17:27,268
Even so, you can't be permitted to live.

299
00:17:27,798 --> 00:17:29,048
That's just how it is.

300
00:17:35,895 --> 00:17:36,984
Mikasa!

301
00:17:44,405 --> 00:17:46,399
Don't do it. We can't chase him.

302
00:17:46,953 --> 00:17:49,117
There's no telling when he'll choose to transform.

303
00:17:49,561 --> 00:17:51,024
If we don't keep our distance,

304
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,740
we'll just get caught in the explosion.

305
00:17:53,785 --> 00:17:56,346
I don't think Bertholdt intends to do that just yet.

306
00:17:56,774 --> 00:17:59,041
He must've seen how badly wounded Reiner is.

307
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:01,201
Transforming now would probably kill him.

308
00:18:01,977 --> 00:18:05,881
Our best bet is to take Reiner hostage
and fight Bertholdt with our blades.

309
00:18:06,102 --> 00:18:07,700
That'd make sense, but...

310
00:18:08,445 --> 00:18:11,584
From the look of him, it seemed like he had a plan.

311
00:18:13,452 --> 00:18:14,577
And not only that.

312
00:18:14,714 --> 00:18:16,519
He seemed more determined than before.

313
00:18:17,312 --> 00:18:19,520
Almost like an entirely different person.

314
00:18:20,014 --> 00:18:22,325
Yeah. I saw it, too.

315
00:18:24,058 --> 00:18:26,411
Hurry! The Armored Titan is weak!

316
00:18:26,491 --> 00:18:28,164
We just have to finish him! Uh...

317
00:18:30,258 --> 00:18:31,899
His nape's to the ground now.

318
00:18:33,659 --> 00:18:35,053
What're we supposed to do?

319
00:18:36,776 --> 00:18:39,008
This sure is a peculiar feeling.

320
00:18:39,441 --> 00:18:41,447
I'm not scared at all, for once.

321
00:18:42,016 --> 00:18:43,703
And I see everything clearly.

322
00:18:44,034 --> 00:18:46,667
I know... that no matter what happens,

323
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:48,590
I can accept how this ends.

324
00:18:49,276 --> 00:18:51,579
Yeah. No one's in the wrong here.

325
00:18:51,826 --> 00:18:53,549
There was nothing to be done.

326
00:18:56,345 --> 00:18:58,323
We had no choice in all this.

327
00:18:59,193 --> 00:19:02,565
Because this world... is just that cruel.

328
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:04,275
He's going up! Don't tell me...!

329
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:07,009
But, if he transforms, he'll kill Reiner, too!

330
00:19:07,069 --> 00:19:08,629
We need to get out of here!

331
00:19:10,343 --> 00:19:11,901
Hange, look out!

332
00:19:45,448 --> 00:19:46,563
Are you guys alive?

333
00:19:46,786 --> 00:19:49,161
Hell if I know! Are you?

334
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,419
I'm fine. Hangin' in there.

335
00:19:52,286 --> 00:19:53,597
Mikasa! Armin!

336
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:55,416
You two okay?

337
00:19:55,582 --> 00:19:56,744
Yeah, it missed us.

338
00:19:56,847 --> 00:19:57,997
Where's Hange Squad?

339
00:19:59,563 --> 00:20:01,740
They were right underneath the blast zone.

340
00:20:15,769 --> 00:20:17,090
Are you saying...

341
00:20:22,977 --> 00:20:24,890
...the only ones who survived...

342
00:20:25,602 --> 00:20:27,345
...are the six of us?

343
00:20:35,925 --> 00:20:36,871
Oh, no.

344
00:20:43,529 --> 00:20:44,944
Armin! What do we do now?

345
00:20:45,026 --> 00:20:47,740
We can't just wait to get flattened by burning houses!

346
00:20:48,744 --> 00:20:49,337
Hey.

347
00:20:49,963 --> 00:20:52,776
You're in command now, Armin. We'll follow you to the end.

348
00:20:54,727 --> 00:20:55,381
We...

349
00:20:56,108 --> 00:20:57,010
We retreat.

350
00:20:57,394 --> 00:20:59,822
Fall back to the commander and request new orders.

351
00:21:00,388 --> 00:21:04,883
To beat the Colossal Titan in a battle of
attrition as planned, we have to keep our distance.

352
00:21:05,107 --> 00:21:07,149
That was the plan, but think.

353
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:11,112
If we let the Colossal Titan reach
the wall, the others'll be finished.

354
00:21:12,394 --> 00:21:14,935
He'll spread that fire to the houses past the gate.

355
00:21:15,369 --> 00:21:18,430
Our other squads'll be trapped
between the Titans and the flames.

356
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:20,065
You're right.

357
00:21:20,516 --> 00:21:22,966
Our only hope is to beat Bertholdt right now.

358
00:21:23,194 --> 00:21:24,325
And we won't get help.

359
00:21:24,592 --> 00:21:26,940
We have to do it with the people we have here.

360
00:21:33,915 --> 00:21:35,051
Hey, Armin!

361
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:36,952
Your orders? C'mon!

362
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:38,269
What should we do?

363
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:56,606
I bet you're pleased with yourself.

364
00:21:57,385 --> 00:21:59,005
Your plan's working so far.

365
00:21:59,582 --> 00:22:00,967
What will you do next?

366
00:23:42,281 --> 00:23:44,658
The Colossal Titan makes its move,

367
00:23:44,816 --> 00:23:46,857
setting Shiganshina ablaze.

368
00:23:47,579 --> 00:23:51,761
Meanwhile, Erwin and the others
are forced into a desperate charge.

369
00:23:53,125 --> 00:23:56,158
