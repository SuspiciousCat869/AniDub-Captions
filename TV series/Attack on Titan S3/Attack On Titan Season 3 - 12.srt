1
00:00:01,833 --> 00:00:02,738
Guess what?

2
00:00:03,375 --> 00:00:07,142
This means we finally have a real
shot at plugging the hole in Wall Maria.

3
00:00:08,547 --> 00:00:13,926
The Scout Regiment hurries its preparations
for the mission to retake Wall Maria.

4
00:00:15,917 --> 00:00:16,771
Ooh!

5
00:00:19,742 --> 00:00:20,655
Hell yeah!

6
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:21,785
We did it, Eren!

7
00:00:24,917 --> 00:00:25,733
Eren?

8
00:00:26,042 --> 00:00:27,091
I'm fine.

9
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,965
Let's just make these weapons quickly,

10
00:00:29,917 --> 00:00:31,451
and then go to Shiganshina.

11
00:00:31,651 --> 00:00:33,811
Seems if I just stick myself,

12
00:00:34,407 --> 00:00:36,847
I'll turn into a big, strong Titan.

13
00:00:38,257 --> 00:00:40,160
Then came another surprise.

14
00:00:40,974 --> 00:00:44,632
One more thing with the potential
to shape the fate of humanity.

15
00:00:49,183 --> 00:00:51,219
Looks like I'm late. Sorry.

16
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:55,707
Have any luck?

17
00:00:56,433 --> 00:00:58,813
Were you able to establish what's in the container?

18
00:00:59,266 --> 00:01:05,185
We have a vague idea, but unfortunately, with
our technology, I'm afraid we can't dig much deeper.

19
00:01:06,208 --> 00:01:08,308
Like we've heard from Eren and Historia,

20
00:01:08,458 --> 00:01:11,962
it seems to originate from some sort of human body fluid.

21
00:01:13,567 --> 00:01:19,741
However, it vaporizes when exposed to air, making
further analysis virtually impossible to perform.

22
00:01:20,122 --> 00:01:24,023
Whoever made it must have had
technology far superior to ours.

23
00:01:24,833 --> 00:01:28,250
I can't imagine how the Reiss
family could've managed to do it.

24
00:01:28,417 --> 00:01:29,041
Hmm...

25
00:01:31,792 --> 00:01:34,183
In that case, rather than tamper with it,

26
00:01:34,266 --> 00:01:36,943
we should put it to use for our current objective.

27
00:01:37,673 --> 00:01:39,653
But to whom do we entrust it?

28
00:01:40,231 --> 00:01:41,829
To you, Erwin?

29
00:01:42,417 --> 00:01:46,525
No. With my wound, I would be a poor choice.

30
00:01:47,252 --> 00:01:50,299
This syringe, it belongs in the hands of one of our elite.

31
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:52,388
Someone with the best odds of survival.

32
00:01:53,167 --> 00:01:55,295
Levi, will you accept it?

33
00:01:56,486 --> 00:01:58,249
If it's an order, just say so.

34
00:01:59,042 --> 00:02:00,546
Why even bother asking?

35
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:06,226
When we need to use this, there may not be time to plan.

36
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:11,215
We'll be relying on you to make a decision
swiftly, and with little deliberation.

37
00:02:12,542 --> 00:02:14,505
Judging when to use it, and on whom,

38
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:16,108
will be your responsibility.

39
00:02:17,958 --> 00:02:19,430
Will you accept it?

40
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,244
If this dream of yours comes true,

41
00:02:23,581 --> 00:02:24,777
what will you do then?

42
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:28,479
I don't know, and I won't.

43
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,323
Not until it happens.

44
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:33,295
I see.

45
00:02:33,667 --> 00:02:36,178
All right. I'll do it.

46
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:40,564
Hmm...

47
00:02:41,016 --> 00:02:43,670
Now then, I'd like to discuss that work of mine.

48
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,775
As you know, I'm hoping to unveil it soon.

49
00:02:45,873 --> 00:02:47,341
Have you given it any thought?

50
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,826
You mean you still haven't given up on that?

51
00:02:49,989 --> 00:02:52,948
If the public were to see such a repulsive display,

52
00:02:53,023 --> 00:02:56,126
whatever trust they have in the military would evaporate.

53
00:02:56,714 --> 00:02:58,931
You don't know art when you see it.

54
00:04:41,167 --> 00:04:44,090
You spoke to Sadies, and based on what he told you,

55
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:47,872
it seems that Grisha Jaeger is a
human who came from outside the walls.

56
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:53,291
Yes, and like the others, Annie, Reiner, and Bertholdt,

57
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,174
it appears he also had the Power of the Titans.

58
00:04:56,623 --> 00:04:58,939
But where those three sought to undermine it,

59
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:02,014
he was supportive of humanity within the walls.

60
00:05:02,964 --> 00:05:06,170
If he was really that supportive
of the Scouts and what we do,

61
00:05:06,574 --> 00:05:09,537
maybe he coulda thrown a bit more information our way.

62
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:10,721
I wonder.

63
00:05:11,142 --> 00:05:14,654
From the moment he entered the walls,
he was searching for the royal family.

64
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:16,871
A heavy burden to shoulder alone.

65
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,088
If you ask me,

66
00:05:19,292 --> 00:05:23,370
that's not something you do unless you
have an iron will and incredible resolve.

67
00:05:24,042 --> 00:05:25,388
And let's not forget,

68
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:28,668
that same man later wanted to show his young son,

69
00:05:28,792 --> 00:05:31,546
eager to join the Scouts, something important.

70
00:05:32,808 --> 00:05:37,265
Staring death in the face, he said the
truth of it all was there, in the cellar.

71
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:40,778
What's down there? What was he hiding?

72
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:45,465
Things which mustn't be said.

73
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:50,305
No. Things which can't be spoken.

74
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:52,728
Things he couldn't say, even if he wanted to.

75
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:57,169
That which the First Reiss
King wiped from our consciousness.

76
00:05:57,667 --> 00:05:59,004
Memories of our world.

77
00:06:00,792 --> 00:06:02,055
At least, that's my hope.

78
00:06:02,725 --> 00:06:05,059
But speculating more won't accomplish anything.

79
00:06:07,293 --> 00:06:09,412
The final preparations are now complete.

80
00:06:10,167 --> 00:06:13,520
The operation to retake Wall Maria begins in two days.

81
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,204
Wanna know what's in that cellar?

82
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:19,040
Let's go see for ourselves.

83
00:06:19,792 --> 00:06:22,082
We're Scouts. That's what we do.

84
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,352
I'll leave it to you to alert your squads.

85
00:06:28,632 --> 00:06:31,133
Right. We'll keep it quiet for now, though.

86
00:06:31,667 --> 00:06:34,389
I think our troops deserve some meat on a day like this.

87
00:06:34,667 --> 00:06:35,614
Good idea.

88
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:38,363
Gotta show those kids the adults can be counted on.

89
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:43,807
What about Commandant Sadies
keeping important secrets from us.

90
00:06:43,857 --> 00:06:46,461
Forget it. We don't have time to deal with that now.

91
00:06:47,042 --> 00:06:48,828
You must be so disappointed.

92
00:06:48,868 --> 00:06:50,274
You used to adore him!

93
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:51,060
Shut up!

94
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:56,271
What is it, Levi?

95
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,704
This may sound impatient,

96
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:02,842
but what do you think you'll do after retaking Wall Maria?

97
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:06,878
I'm guessing a defense plan comes first, but after that?

98
00:07:07,417 --> 00:07:08,371
What's next?

99
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:10,532
Eliminating threats.

100
00:07:11,224 --> 00:07:15,663
Outside the walls, there seems to be
someone hoping that Titans will eat us all,

101
00:07:15,688 --> 00:07:16,976
down to the last person.

102
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:20,304
As to who, well, if we have any luck,

103
00:07:20,417 --> 00:07:22,179
we'll find that answer in the cellar.

104
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:25,064
A full plan will have to wait.

105
00:07:25,881 --> 00:07:28,010
First we need to see what's in that room.

106
00:07:28,892 --> 00:07:32,206
You realize I'm asking this now
because you might not live that long.

107
00:07:33,129 --> 00:07:35,384
You're not exactly as spry as you used to be.

108
00:07:37,085 --> 00:07:39,347
Let Hange call the shots on this mission.

109
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:42,215
In your shape, you'll only be dead weight.

110
00:07:42,792 --> 00:07:44,813
You sit back and wait for the good news.

111
00:07:45,207 --> 00:07:47,515
We'll tell the others I argued till you gave in.

112
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:51,591
Which I will, so why not make this easier on both of us?

113
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,029
What do you say?

114
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:02,197
No.

115
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,869
Do what you need to. Use me as bait.

116
00:08:07,667 --> 00:08:09,770
The chain of command still remains.

117
00:08:10,417 --> 00:08:11,898
If I'm gone, then Hange.

118
00:08:12,417 --> 00:08:14,115
If Hange's gone, the next.

119
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:18,190
It's true this operation will be extremely dangerous,

120
00:08:18,851 --> 00:08:21,622
but it will also be the most
important one in human history.

121
00:08:22,167 --> 00:08:23,949
That's why I've gone to such lengths.

122
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:26,000
This is my plan, Levi.

123
00:08:26,747 --> 00:08:29,462
Without me leading you, you're less likely to succeed.

124
00:08:29,664 --> 00:08:33,021
That's true. Without you, the operation might fail.

125
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:36,301
But if you bite the dust out there, we're really screwed.

126
00:08:37,263 --> 00:08:40,609
So just stay safe at your desk
and keep using that head of yours.

127
00:08:41,401 --> 00:08:42,810
As far as I'm concerned,

128
00:08:43,051 --> 00:08:44,986
that's the last thing the Titans would want,

129
00:08:45,526 --> 00:08:47,816
and the best weapon that humanity's got.

130
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:49,944
No, you're wrong.

131
00:08:50,417 --> 00:08:53,458
Our best option is for me to
gamble it all on the plan that I...

132
00:08:53,494 --> 00:08:55,903
Okay, that's enough. Stop right there.

133
00:08:56,566 --> 00:08:58,780
Any more of those noble-ass excuses,

134
00:08:58,949 --> 00:09:00,981
and I'm gonna break both your damn legs.

135
00:09:01,575 --> 00:09:02,657
Not too badly.

136
00:09:02,853 --> 00:09:08,536
They'll heal just fine, but you'll be way too busted
up to even think about joining us on the operation.

137
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,294
And it'll be a bitch to get to the toilet.

138
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,982
Don't like that idea much.

139
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:20,184
Normally, I'd agree with you.

140
00:09:20,698 --> 00:09:23,265
A wounded soldier should stay off the battlefield.

141
00:09:25,935 --> 00:09:26,849
However...

142
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,305
That may be the day we learn the truth about our world,

143
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:34,165
and I'll be damned if I'm going to miss it.

144
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:39,513
Being there is that important?

145
00:09:40,442 --> 00:09:41,841
More than your legs?

146
00:09:42,042 --> 00:09:42,937
Yes.

147
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,822
More than humanity's victory?

148
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,783
Yes.

149
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:53,567
I see.

150
00:09:59,889 --> 00:10:01,020
Fine, Erwin.

151
00:10:01,406 --> 00:10:03,562
In that case, I'll trust your judgment.

152
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:21,683
This may be a special night, but we
don't need the public knowing our plans.

153
00:10:22,167 --> 00:10:25,140
So, behave like the disciplined soldiers you are.

154
00:10:25,577 --> 00:10:27,349
What? No way.

155
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,686
Is that...? It is.

156
00:10:30,042 --> 00:10:30,844
It's meat.

157
00:10:32,351 --> 00:10:33,458
Am I dreaming?

158
00:10:33,698 --> 00:10:36,937
All right. Here's to the re-taking of Wall Maria.

159
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:38,382
A toast!

160
00:10:39,107 --> 00:10:40,473
Huh? Wait!

161
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:43,078
Calm down! Everyone'll get some, okay?

162
00:10:43,103 --> 00:10:45,090
Hey! A piece that big counts as two!

163
00:10:45,115 --> 00:10:45,989
You're crazy!

164
00:10:46,014 --> 00:10:47,881
Well, I'm worth two of you on the battlefield,

165
00:10:47,906 --> 00:10:49,683
so I think I should get your portion!

166
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:50,670
Like hell!

167
00:10:50,973 --> 00:10:53,411
What the hell do you think you're doing, potato girl?

168
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:55,823
No way are we gonna let you pull this shit!

169
00:10:55,917 --> 00:10:57,350
Drop the meat, Sasha.

170
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:59,974
Come on, I really don't wanna have to kill you.

171
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:03,556
You can't eat the whole thing alone, you pig!

172
00:11:03,945 --> 00:11:06,583
Ah! You're eating me! My hand! My hand!

173
00:11:06,608 --> 00:11:08,528
Sasha! That meat is Jean!

174
00:11:08,553 --> 00:11:10,410
We don't eat our friends, okay?

175
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:13,083
What, does the Scout Regiment never get any meat?

176
00:11:13,167 --> 00:11:14,724
Really? That's just sad...

177
00:11:17,672 --> 00:11:20,292
Conny, would you just knock her out already?

178
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:21,539
I'm trying!

179
00:11:21,652 --> 00:11:24,846
It's like her mind's shut down,
but she's still moving somehow!

180
00:11:24,871 --> 00:11:27,302
Hey, I think we've got casualties.

181
00:11:27,327 --> 00:11:30,000
Whose brilliant idea was it to serve meat, again?

182
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:31,905
Well, I guess now we know what happens

183
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:36,188
when we blow the whole food budget for
two months on one night of celebrating.

184
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:40,318
That should do it.

185
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:42,145
She finally wore herself out.

186
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:45,615
Jeez, can you believe this freak?

187
00:11:46,167 --> 00:11:49,392
It's crazy to think that she once
offered to share meat with everybody.

188
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:50,978
What? She did?

189
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,860
Yeah, four months ago,

190
00:11:53,176 --> 00:11:54,902
when we were servicing the cannons.

191
00:11:56,986 --> 00:11:59,893
I totally just helped myself to the Officer's Pantry.

192
00:12:00,949 --> 00:12:02,006
It'll be fine.

193
00:12:02,695 --> 00:12:04,015
Just look at it this way.

194
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:08,001
Pretty soon, we'll take back
all the room we need for livestock.

195
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:13,604
They're gonna get in.

196
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:17,257
They're gonna get in. They're gonna get in!

197
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:20,309
He's gone!

198
00:12:20,676 --> 00:12:23,757
In the moment, I felt sorry for you.

199
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:25,864
Hey.

200
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:32,674
It's hard to believe that it's only been four months.

201
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,424
Yeah, it's kinda crazy.

202
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:38,864
But think, that's all it took for us to make Levi Squad.

203
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:40,976
How's that for climbin' the ranks?

204
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:46,745
It's all because you're a genius. Damn straight I am.

205
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:49,493
Come on. Let's eat before it gets cold.

206
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,162
Don't you get it?

207
00:12:52,792 --> 00:12:54,378
You've got no experience.

208
00:12:54,417 --> 00:12:56,586
That's why you're in the rear guard, rookie.

209
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:59,164
I may be less knowledgeable than the rest of you,

210
00:12:59,189 --> 00:13:02,897
but isn't the vanguard the best
place to learn how the enemy moves?

211
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:04,240
What's this?

212
00:13:04,265 --> 00:13:07,308
You think that you can lecture
a veteran about self-sacrifice?

213
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:09,196
Isn't that what makes us effective?

214
00:13:09,494 --> 00:13:11,920
Being willing to put ourselves in harm's way?

215
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:15,440
Listen, everyone starts out as a recruit, okay?

216
00:13:15,574 --> 00:13:18,341
If we throw recruits into battle like cannon fodder,

217
00:13:18,641 --> 00:13:20,635
then they'll all be too dead to learn.

218
00:13:20,891 --> 00:13:24,250
And that's why, for now, it's your
job to watch and learn from the rear.

219
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:26,571
So you can make it back in one piece.

220
00:13:28,121 --> 00:13:33,892
The ones who really suck are the suicidal maniacs
who think the only way to fight is to charge in blind.

221
00:13:33,957 --> 00:13:34,643
Right?

222
00:13:37,542 --> 00:13:40,125
Are you talkin' about somebody in particular?

223
00:13:42,175 --> 00:13:45,701
Yeah, I'm looking right at him. Suicidal maniac.

224
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:50,604
You see, the funny thing is that I recently
discovered that I'm actually a pretty normal person.

225
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:54,725
So, hey, if that's how you really see
me, then maybe you're just a coward, Jean.

226
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:55,330
Right?

227
00:13:57,682 --> 00:14:00,475
You think you're so cool, don't you, you piece of shit?

228
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,872
That's a pretty shaggy-looking
mane you're growing there, horse face!

229
00:14:03,917 --> 00:14:05,318
What's with those two?

230
00:14:05,382 --> 00:14:06,970
Try not to kill each other.

231
00:14:06,995 --> 00:14:07,792
You jerk!

232
00:14:07,817 --> 00:14:09,108
You're gonna rip my shirt!

233
00:14:09,133 --> 00:14:10,958
What the hell are those two doing?

234
00:14:15,675 --> 00:14:16,870
You bastard!

235
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:20,767
Show 'em what you've got!

236
00:14:20,792 --> 00:14:22,216
He's losing ground!

237
00:14:23,338 --> 00:14:25,250
It looks like we've got a fight.

238
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:27,269
I told the idiots to behave.

239
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:31,774
But seriously.

240
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:36,477
If you didn't have Titan powers,
you'd be dead ten times over.

241
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,428
Although, I guess Mikasa would've swooped
in every time to save your worthless ass.

242
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:44,114
You so eager to die?

243
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,671
Fine, then I'll kill you!

244
00:14:47,882 --> 00:14:49,254
Yeah? Okay.

245
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:51,469
Give it your best shot!

246
00:14:51,734 --> 00:14:56,100
You oughta start showin' your
mom some more respect, Jean-boy!

247
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:57,558
Would you forget that?

248
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:58,635
Never!

249
00:15:00,127 --> 00:15:01,982
Should we let them keep going?

250
00:15:06,377 --> 00:15:07,527
I think it's fine.

251
00:15:10,667 --> 00:15:11,502
Why?

252
00:15:12,097 --> 00:15:14,949
Why isn't anybody stopping us?

253
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:17,142
How long's this gonna go on?

254
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:20,644
Shit. I think I'm gonna barf up that meat.

255
00:15:20,792 --> 00:15:21,342
Hey.

256
00:15:24,426 --> 00:15:25,927
That's enough celebrating.

257
00:15:27,278 --> 00:15:28,500
Go to bed.

258
00:15:29,481 --> 00:15:30,671
And clean that up.

259
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:31,797
Yes, sir!

260
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,354
Ahh...

261
00:15:38,822 --> 00:15:40,729
I can't believe I'm saying this,

262
00:15:40,754 --> 00:15:43,654
but shouldn't you guys watch out for me more?

263
00:15:44,853 --> 00:15:48,573
Considering how quickly you heal, I
wasn't especially worried about it.

264
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:52,474
Some friends you are.

265
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:54,785
Look, you started it, so don't complain.

266
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:57,995
Plus, it's good to see you feisty again.

267
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,264
I'm glad we met with the commandant.

268
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:07,147
I think it helped.

269
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:11,700
I don't know about being feisty,
but I'll do what I have to.

270
00:16:13,042 --> 00:16:16,331
And honestly, I feel better.

271
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:20,010
I just kept thinking about
all the stuff I couldn't change.

272
00:16:21,476 --> 00:16:26,341
Spent so much time pitying myself, wondering
why I couldn't be strong like Mikasa and Levi.

273
00:16:27,305 --> 00:16:32,070
I was jealous, but even though you guys are strong,

274
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:34,605
you can't do all that much alone.

275
00:16:36,186 --> 00:16:37,480
None of us can.

276
00:16:38,051 --> 00:16:40,332
That's why we have to find our own roles.

277
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:42,525
When we join together,

278
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:45,274
that's when we become truly powerful.

279
00:16:47,349 --> 00:16:49,255
Everyone's got their own strengths,

280
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:51,566
and it's 'cause of times like this.

281
00:17:01,841 --> 00:17:02,445
Yeah.

282
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:05,574
I think you're right.

283
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:27,740
Once we've retaken Wall Maria

284
00:17:28,391 --> 00:17:30,871
and defeated every last one of our enemies...

285
00:17:31,651 --> 00:17:32,802
...can we go back?

286
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:35,512
To how things used to be?

287
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:38,744
Some things will be the same,

288
00:17:39,075 --> 00:17:42,105
but some things have changed forever.

289
00:17:42,909 --> 00:17:44,878
And we'll make them pay for that.

290
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:47,794
Yeah.

291
00:17:49,479 --> 00:17:51,044
There's more out there, though.

292
00:17:52,893 --> 00:17:55,246
The sea. Remember?

293
00:17:55,691 --> 00:18:00,640
A body of water so big that merchants could spend
their whole lives and still not get all the salt out.

294
00:18:02,292 --> 00:18:05,464
There's so much beyond the walls. Not just Titans.

295
00:18:06,417 --> 00:18:09,333
Water that glows like fire, fields of ice,

296
00:18:09,417 --> 00:18:11,372
giant rocks that take days to climb.

297
00:18:11,722 --> 00:18:14,662
I joined the Scouts so I could
see all those things someday.

298
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:18,037
Yeah. You sure did.

299
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:19,555
I remember.

300
00:18:27,734 --> 00:18:28,763
All right then!

301
00:18:29,668 --> 00:18:31,616
Let's start by finding the sea!

302
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:34,166
I can tell you still don't think it's real, Eren.

303
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:37,083
You'll see! It does exist!

304
00:18:37,167 --> 00:18:38,974
Heh. Okay, fine.

305
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:41,230
I guess we'll just have to check it out, then.

306
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:42,891
That's not good enough!

307
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:44,475
You have to promise!

308
00:18:44,552 --> 00:18:46,085
Oh, great, here we go again.

309
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:47,706
This is our chance to explore the outside world!

310
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:50,542
It's gotta be way bigger than inside the walls!

311
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:52,289
Okay, I promise.

312
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,681
Just before sunset.

313
00:19:03,631 --> 00:19:04,971
It's finally time.

314
00:19:17,644 --> 00:19:19,336
Hey!

315
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:23,767
Hange! Good luck!

316
00:19:23,792 --> 00:19:24,583
Flegel?

317
00:19:25,779 --> 00:19:29,170
Go out there and take back Wall Maria for us!

318
00:19:29,542 --> 00:19:32,666
The future of mankind is up to you!

319
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:34,756
Captain Levi!

320
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,760
Good luck out there! Thanks for saving our city!

321
00:19:39,739 --> 00:19:42,725
You guys come back in one piece, all right?

322
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:46,682
Yeah! But get us back our land, too!

323
00:19:47,707 --> 00:19:49,463
Someone's got a big mouth.

324
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:53,411
Yeah, well, that celebration did get a little rowdy.

325
00:19:53,628 --> 00:19:57,631
Actually, we ordered all of that
meat from the Reeves Company, so...

326
00:19:58,391 --> 00:19:59,505
Flegel.

327
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:03,612
Yeah! You can count on us!

328
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:07,727
I wonder how long it's been since
the Scouts got a send-off like this.

329
00:20:07,879 --> 00:20:10,867
I dunno. I'm not sure if we ever have.

330
00:20:12,074 --> 00:20:13,957
Well, as far as I'm aware, at least,

331
00:20:14,258 --> 00:20:15,403
this is a first.

332
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:36,639
The operation to retake Wall Maria begins now!

333
00:20:44,617 --> 00:20:47,450
Scouts, move out!

334
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:43,940
You two.

335
00:22:44,861 --> 00:22:48,199
Do you have even the faintest damn clue...

336
00:22:48,724 --> 00:22:49,977
...what you're doing?
