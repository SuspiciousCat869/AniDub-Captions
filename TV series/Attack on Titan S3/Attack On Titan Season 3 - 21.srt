1
00:00:10,324 --> 00:00:14,437
He squeezed the soldier's lives
out as if he were juicing fruit.

2
00:00:15,176 --> 00:00:18,986
And then, he cast the scraps into the sea.

3
00:00:26,127 --> 00:00:28,581
I suppose I ought to explain what the sea is.

4
00:00:31,008 --> 00:00:33,333
It's an enormous body of salt water

5
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:36,732
that covers 70% of our world's surface.

6
00:02:26,167 --> 00:02:28,688
Hold on. You said you were the Owl?

7
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:33,479
Yes, my name's Eren Kruger.

8
00:02:33,518 --> 00:02:34,909
As you just observed,

9
00:02:34,984 --> 00:02:37,649
I have the power of one of the Nine Titans,

10
00:02:37,925 --> 00:02:40,939
which proves that I'm a Subject of Ymir, just like you.

11
00:02:42,727 --> 00:02:46,230
You got into Public Security
by pretending to be a Marleyan?

12
00:02:46,426 --> 00:02:48,573
But what about the blood tests?

13
00:02:48,716 --> 00:02:51,720
With the help of a doctor, they were quite easy to pass.

14
00:02:52,442 --> 00:02:53,960
Doctors make good spies.

15
00:02:54,449 --> 00:02:56,559
In all honesty, you're a fine example of that.

16
00:02:58,175 --> 00:02:59,904
But considering your results,

17
00:03:00,365 --> 00:03:02,313
I see why Grice lamented as he did.

18
00:03:03,859 --> 00:03:05,222
I have no excuses.

19
00:03:05,966 --> 00:03:11,609
I was a bad husband, a worthless
father, and an imbecilic man.

20
00:03:12,562 --> 00:03:13,930
So explain to me.

21
00:03:14,476 --> 00:03:18,140
Why am I the only one left standing as a human?

22
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:25,178
My wife Dina was special. A
Subject of Ymir with royal blood.

23
00:03:25,435 --> 00:03:28,310
She could've made full use of the power of the Titans.

24
00:03:28,456 --> 00:03:31,988
And if you hadn't shut me up, she'd still be...

25
00:03:34,293 --> 00:03:37,159
Tell me why! Why did you save only me?

26
00:03:38,933 --> 00:03:41,694
Let go. You're just making your hands worse.

27
00:03:42,177 --> 00:03:45,842
I'm grateful for your concern,
but I didn't notice much before

28
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:48,156
when you were cutting off my fingers.

29
00:03:49,032 --> 00:03:52,246
So? Why didn't you transform into a Titan earlier?

30
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,869
If you'd made your move sooner, they'd be fine right now!

31
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:58,007
What was the point of waiting
for them to be turned into monsters?

32
00:04:01,073 --> 00:04:03,900
What's wrong? Why do you look so pale?

33
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:08,542
It wasn't only your comrades.

34
00:04:09,268 --> 00:04:12,760
I've severed thousands of fingers
from fellow Subjects of Ymir.

35
00:04:13,351 --> 00:04:18,021
I've created countless Titans
from men, women, and children.

36
00:04:20,235 --> 00:04:23,115
All the while telling myself it was for Eldia.

37
00:04:26,074 --> 00:04:28,238
I'm sorry, Grisha. Time is short.

38
00:04:28,865 --> 00:04:30,867
I'm entrusting you with this last task.

39
00:04:31,192 --> 00:04:33,410
There's no one else I can trust to see it through.

40
00:04:42,692 --> 00:04:45,717
That day, when I first met you outside,

41
00:04:46,601 --> 00:04:48,435
you may wish you could take it back.

42
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,524
But if not for what happened,

43
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:53,510
you wouldn't hate Marley nearly enough to come this far.

44
00:04:54,285 --> 00:04:57,649
So is that the reason why you chose me?

45
00:04:58,969 --> 00:05:00,097
It's part of it.

46
00:05:01,276 --> 00:05:04,664
The country. Your father. Yourself.

47
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:06,936
You bore it all such hatred.

48
00:05:07,551 --> 00:05:10,281
The look in your eyes could've burnt the world to ash.

49
00:05:11,627 --> 00:05:13,635
I felt that same rage for a time.

50
00:05:14,942 --> 00:05:18,552
The branch of the royal family that
stayed behind started a revolution,

51
00:05:18,734 --> 00:05:20,562
and my father was a staunch supporter.

52
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:22,732
It failed.

53
00:05:23,568 --> 00:05:25,371
Not only did they accomplish nothing,

54
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:27,578
all of them were burnt alive.

55
00:05:28,359 --> 00:05:29,430
I was still young.

56
00:05:29,883 --> 00:05:30,812
I couldn't help.

57
00:05:31,113 --> 00:05:33,211
I just peeked through the closet door and watched.

58
00:05:34,386 --> 00:05:35,445
After that day,

59
00:05:35,688 --> 00:05:39,258
I swore I would take revenge
and restore the Eldian Empire.

60
00:05:41,117 --> 00:05:44,796
But all I've managed to do is cut
the fingers off my fellow patriots,

61
00:05:45,131 --> 00:05:48,784
kick them off this wall, and
watch the humanity leave them.

62
00:05:49,657 --> 00:05:51,341
I had to do these heinous deeds,

63
00:05:52,032 --> 00:05:54,144
or else I would've been found out as the Owl.

64
00:05:56,218 --> 00:05:58,426
I'm not sure I've changed since that day.

65
00:05:58,902 --> 00:06:02,971
Perhaps I'm still a child looking at
the world through a cracked closet door.

66
00:06:06,434 --> 00:06:07,785
So go on and tell me.

67
00:06:08,143 --> 00:06:12,617
This task... What exactly is it you're asking me to do?

68
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:19,664
I want you to make your way into the
walls and take the Founding Titan by force.

69
00:06:20,351 --> 00:06:22,549
After you've inherited my Titan, that is.

70
00:06:24,657 --> 00:06:27,807
You want me to... what? But I...

71
00:06:28,143 --> 00:06:30,309
You'll have to eat me alive as a Titan.

72
00:06:31,101 --> 00:06:34,369
That's also how you'll steal the
Founding Titan from the royal family.

73
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,330
But why don't you do it?

74
00:06:39,184 --> 00:06:43,619
Anyone who inherits the power of one
of the Nine will perish 13 years later.

75
00:06:44,899 --> 00:06:47,059
And that's how long it's been for me.

76
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:51,500
He said that was the rule. Called it the "Curse of Ymir."

77
00:06:52,141 --> 00:06:56,058
The first Titan, Ymir, died
that long after getting her powers.

78
00:06:56,215 --> 00:06:59,214
Since none can surpass her, we have to do the same.

79
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,106
So I have 13 years to live.

80
00:07:02,766 --> 00:07:03,441
And you...

81
00:07:04,032 --> 00:07:07,040
I've only got eight left. Not even.

82
00:07:07,074 --> 00:07:09,860
No. You're wrong.

83
00:07:10,417 --> 00:07:11,678
There's been a mistake.

84
00:07:15,383 --> 00:07:16,652
It can't be true.

85
00:07:21,341 --> 00:07:23,777
If someone with the powers of one of the Nine

86
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:26,694
should die without passing it on to a successor,

87
00:07:27,324 --> 00:07:31,127
the power will be inherited
by a baby born after that death.

88
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:33,424
A Subject of Ymir, of course.

89
00:07:34,115 --> 00:07:35,648
For that to be the case,

90
00:07:36,174 --> 00:07:40,288
it seems all of us Eldians must be
connected by something we can't see.

91
00:07:40,865 --> 00:07:43,665
There was one successor who said there were paths...

92
00:07:44,574 --> 00:07:46,796
paths that the naked eye can't observe...

93
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:49,132
through which Titan flesh can move,

94
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,523
along with memories and the will to act.

95
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,755
These paths are countless.

96
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:56,875
They reach far, and in many directions,

97
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:59,341
but they all meet at one coordinate.

98
00:07:59,967 --> 00:08:01,351
The Founding Titan.

99
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,791
There's not a Subject of Ymir alive

100
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:08,778
who isn't connected to the coordinate.

101
00:08:09,894 --> 00:08:12,855
Speaking of Ymir, who do you think she really was?

102
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:16,701
To the Marleyan State, she's the devil's pawn.

103
00:08:17,453 --> 00:08:20,683
But to the Eldian Empire, she was a miracle of God.

104
00:08:21,966 --> 00:08:25,328
There are those who believe that
she touched the source of all life,

105
00:08:25,579 --> 00:08:27,287
and who am I to say they're wrong?

106
00:08:27,441 --> 00:08:27,886
Huh?

107
00:08:28,053 --> 00:08:30,221
The sole truth of this world, I've found,

108
00:08:30,282 --> 00:08:31,689
is that there is no truth.

109
00:08:32,699 --> 00:08:35,187
Any one of us can become a god or a devil.

110
00:08:35,943 --> 00:08:38,311
All it takes is for people to believe it.

111
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:43,395
You're the one who sent us Dina,
claiming she was of a royal bloodline.

112
00:08:43,562 --> 00:08:45,445
Was that a "truth" of your creation?

113
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:50,698
Unfortunately, Dina's royal heritage was objectively real.

114
00:08:50,843 --> 00:08:52,531
Then why'd you let them turn her?

115
00:08:52,911 --> 00:08:55,208
That'd be because she had royal blood.

116
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:57,648
I couldn't risk letting the Marleyans get her.

117
00:08:58,152 --> 00:09:01,017
She had to go before Zeke could tell Marley more.

118
00:09:02,184 --> 00:09:03,059
Even so...

119
00:09:03,152 --> 00:09:04,123
Even so?

120
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:09,074
The enemy would've forced Dina to bear their
children for the rest of her miserable life.

121
00:09:09,165 --> 00:09:10,422
Would that have been better?

122
00:09:12,157 --> 00:09:15,738
I didn't save our comrades because
they couldn't reach the walls alive.

123
00:09:16,267 --> 00:09:19,686
Only one of the Nine can make
it past all those mindless Titans.

124
00:09:20,245 --> 00:09:22,554
I've done my duty. Now do yours.

125
00:09:23,094 --> 00:09:24,563
To be perfectly honest,

126
00:09:25,002 --> 00:09:26,653
I don't think I'm fit for the job.

127
00:09:27,043 --> 00:09:28,577
You're going to do it.

128
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:31,430
Look at the sergeant.

129
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:34,392
He was eaten alive by a Titan.

130
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:39,825
And afterward, you asked me if
watching that was interesting.

131
00:09:40,301 --> 00:09:42,134
Well, that's not the word I'd've used.

132
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:45,795
Each moment I spent listening
to his screams was unbearable.

133
00:09:47,341 --> 00:09:50,108
I-I didn't know what I was doing.

134
00:09:51,449 --> 00:09:54,089
If I had realized that this was the price of freedom,

135
00:09:54,618 --> 00:09:55,755
I wouldn't've paid.

136
00:10:01,657 --> 00:10:02,453
Stand.

137
00:10:03,024 --> 00:10:03,836
Fight!

138
00:10:05,838 --> 00:10:08,825
If you want to restore freedom and dignity to Eldia,

139
00:10:09,544 --> 00:10:10,555
then stand!

140
00:10:11,195 --> 00:10:13,958
I just... can't.

141
00:10:17,452 --> 00:10:18,970
I brought this from your home.

142
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:20,329
Look at it.

143
00:10:21,827 --> 00:10:23,125
No, I can't.

144
00:10:24,184 --> 00:10:27,115
So you can't fight, or stand, or even look.

145
00:10:27,703 --> 00:10:28,737
What's wrong with you?

146
00:10:29,349 --> 00:10:31,072
Marley cut your balls off?

147
00:10:31,601 --> 00:10:34,710
There's no point in trying to
make me remember my old hatred.

148
00:10:35,849 --> 00:10:37,429
Everything is gone now...

149
00:10:39,384 --> 00:10:40,885
Except my sins.

150
00:10:41,758 --> 00:10:43,388
Those are all you need.

151
00:10:44,993 --> 00:10:47,717
The main reason I chose you was because of that day,

152
00:10:48,068 --> 00:10:49,982
because you went beyond the walls.

153
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:55,528
If you hadn't taken your sister's
hand and run past the gate that day,

154
00:10:55,926 --> 00:10:58,277
you would've ended up running your father's clinic,

155
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,731
and your sister might be married by now.

156
00:11:01,259 --> 00:11:02,980
She might even have had children.

157
00:11:03,627 --> 00:11:06,143
But you'll never know what she would've become.

158
00:11:07,576 --> 00:11:10,601
Ever since you tread forbidden
ground and took her with you.

159
00:11:11,409 --> 00:11:14,724
Ever since the day I first kicked a patriot off this wall.

160
00:11:15,136 --> 00:11:17,329
We've known that we'd have to keep fighting

161
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:19,245
to pay for our sins.

162
00:11:19,602 --> 00:11:22,397
Even in death. Even after.

163
00:11:27,502 --> 00:11:28,538
That's right.

164
00:11:30,453 --> 00:11:32,645
You chose to start this story.

165
00:11:45,199 --> 00:11:47,923
Each of the Nine Titans has a name to describe it,

166
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:51,396
and that includes the one you're about to inherit from me.

167
00:11:53,161 --> 00:11:57,067
Throughout history, this Titan's marched in the vanguard.

168
00:11:57,867 --> 00:12:00,397
It has ever pushed forward, seeking freedom.

169
00:12:01,318 --> 00:12:04,377
And for freedom's sake... it fights.

170
00:12:06,949 --> 00:12:07,737
Therefore...

171
00:12:08,817 --> 00:12:10,543
...it's called the Attack Titan.

172
00:12:19,253 --> 00:12:20,870
What's that all about?

173
00:12:24,678 --> 00:12:26,406
"It's called the Attack Titan."

174
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:28,567
That's what you just did, remember?

175
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:29,783
No.

176
00:12:29,808 --> 00:12:32,320
Huh?! Come on! He did!

177
00:12:32,345 --> 00:12:34,059
Am I the only one who saw him?

178
00:12:34,352 --> 00:12:36,672
No, but... I think he was just...

179
00:12:36,697 --> 00:12:39,636
Just what? Who the hell were you talking to?

180
00:12:39,699 --> 00:12:41,215
No one. It's nothing.

181
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,148
You said the name of your Titan, right?

182
00:12:43,251 --> 00:12:45,664
Are ya practicing ways to introduce him, or...?

183
00:12:45,689 --> 00:12:46,961
Let it go, Hange.

184
00:12:47,216 --> 00:12:50,550
He's 15 years old. We all go through a phase like this.

185
00:12:50,601 --> 00:12:53,175
A phase where we mutter weird crap while posing?

186
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,494
Hange, I'll explain it to you later.

187
00:12:55,709 --> 00:12:57,541
It's not right with him in here.

188
00:12:57,574 --> 00:12:59,299
Oh, it's that kinda phase.

189
00:12:59,324 --> 00:13:01,047
What the hell do you want?!

190
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:02,740
Get out.

191
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:03,367
What?

192
00:13:03,776 --> 00:13:06,714
But I'm not done. I still have ten full days left.

193
00:13:06,824 --> 00:13:07,944
I'm satisfied.

194
00:13:08,532 --> 00:13:11,147
Hange just gave you ten days worth of pain.

195
00:13:11,526 --> 00:13:14,562
We talked it all over with
Premier Zachary, so don't worry.

196
00:13:14,911 --> 00:13:18,615
If we keep the brave heroes who toppled
the Armored and Colossal Titans jailed,

197
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,846
it kinda sends a bad message, you know?

198
00:13:21,018 --> 00:13:25,231
Plus, you were only defying the morons who
had the Beast and Armored Titans at their mercy

199
00:13:25,256 --> 00:13:26,465
but let them get away!

200
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:27,829
That isn't true.

201
00:13:31,657 --> 00:13:33,057
Did you lose some weight?

202
00:13:34,137 --> 00:13:36,132
That's odd. We had plenty to eat.

203
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:42,526
You look... well enough.

204
00:13:42,851 --> 00:13:43,915
Yeah, I guess.

205
00:13:44,076 --> 00:13:44,885
Let's go.

206
00:13:45,104 --> 00:13:46,348
Get dressed already.

207
00:13:46,655 --> 00:13:48,571
Wait, where are we going, Captain?

208
00:13:48,909 --> 00:13:50,114
A state meeting.

209
00:13:50,782 --> 00:13:52,648
Her Majesty has come to Trost.

210
00:14:00,336 --> 00:14:02,031
To my dear Historia.

211
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,828
As I write this, Reiner's standing at my side.

212
00:14:06,309 --> 00:14:09,920
He knows this is a love letter,
but he's still sneaking peeks.

213
00:14:10,407 --> 00:14:13,367
Honestly. It's no wonder the creep's still single.

214
00:14:14,151 --> 00:14:18,888
That said, he did give me his word
that he'd deliver this letter to you.

215
00:14:19,434 --> 00:14:23,434
He says he owes me for the
time I doubled back to save him.

216
00:14:24,794 --> 00:14:26,388
I'm sorry about then.

217
00:14:27,268 --> 00:14:31,790
I never would've imagined
myself choosing those two over you.

218
00:14:33,157 --> 00:14:38,051
I'm going to die soon, but I'll die without regrets.

219
00:14:38,676 --> 00:14:40,348
Or that's what I'd like to say.

220
00:14:40,849 --> 00:14:43,010
Truth is, I do have one.

221
00:14:43,724 --> 00:14:45,895
It's that I never got to marry you.

222
00:14:47,202 --> 00:14:49,114
With love, Ymir.

223
00:15:02,124 --> 00:15:04,089
These paths are countless.

224
00:15:04,407 --> 00:15:07,132
They reach far, and in many directions,

225
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,620
but they all meet at one coordinate:

226
00:15:10,195 --> 00:15:11,574
The Founding Titan.

227
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:16,173
Wait. What was that?

228
00:15:20,221 --> 00:15:21,393
Something wrong?

229
00:15:21,827 --> 00:15:22,575
No.

230
00:15:24,407 --> 00:15:26,160
I take it this is all she wrote?

231
00:15:26,319 --> 00:15:27,128
Yes.

232
00:15:27,611 --> 00:15:32,262
I doubt that she would be permitted to write
anything that might be beneficial to our cause.

233
00:15:32,437 --> 00:15:35,575
Could there be a secret message
that no one can see except you?

234
00:15:35,846 --> 00:15:37,186
Some kind of code?

235
00:15:38,234 --> 00:15:39,196
I don't know.

236
00:15:39,829 --> 00:15:42,327
But frankly, that doesn't sound like her.

237
00:15:43,677 --> 00:15:44,885
Heh.

238
00:15:45,818 --> 00:15:47,888
That idiot. What's with her?

239
00:15:48,612 --> 00:15:50,042
So ridiculous.

240
00:15:51,597 --> 00:15:53,966
Playing it off whenever she got embarrassed.

241
00:15:55,304 --> 00:15:56,889
I could never tell with her.

242
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:00,500
It's us.

243
00:16:00,575 --> 00:16:01,186
Come in.

244
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:10,562
Your Grace.

245
00:16:10,727 --> 00:16:12,060
...Your Grace. ...Your Grace.

246
00:16:12,167 --> 00:16:13,890
Oh, stop it. Please.

247
00:16:14,067 --> 00:16:15,820
I'm not actually ruling yet.

248
00:16:18,052 --> 00:16:20,502
But wow. You've been through so much.

249
00:16:21,262 --> 00:16:25,022
Meanwhile, I've done nothing
but watch the south sky and wait.

250
00:16:25,494 --> 00:16:28,566
It's an important duty of
yours, just to keep safe and well.

251
00:16:28,646 --> 00:16:29,798
Yeah. He's right.

252
00:16:29,978 --> 00:16:30,544
Yeah.

253
00:16:31,221 --> 00:16:34,335
It's good to see that you're still acting like yourselves.

254
00:16:35,792 --> 00:16:40,064
Well, that might just be that
it hasn't sunk in for us yet.

255
00:16:40,564 --> 00:16:42,335
Why don't we get the ball rolling?

256
00:16:46,601 --> 00:16:48,564
<i>The Early Life of Grisha Yeager</i> ,

257
00:16:48,885 --> 00:16:51,972
<i>The Extent of Our Knowledge of Titans and Their History</i> ,

258
00:16:52,201 --> 00:16:55,150
and <i>Information About the World Beyond the Walls</i> .

259
00:16:55,327 --> 00:16:59,783
The only people who know these books
exist are those who are in this room now.

260
00:17:00,636 --> 00:17:04,882
These texts were obtained through the
efforts of the nine Scouts before us,

261
00:17:04,907 --> 00:17:07,154
and the 199 others who were lost.

262
00:17:07,684 --> 00:17:09,920
On this day, and in the Queen's presence.

263
00:17:09,949 --> 00:17:12,660
I'd like for all of us to assess our situation,

264
00:17:13,059 --> 00:17:16,076
and come to an agreement about our next course of action.

265
00:17:18,383 --> 00:17:21,120
Scout Regiment Commander, Hange Zoe.

266
00:17:21,365 --> 00:17:22,024
Sir.

267
00:17:22,611 --> 00:17:25,433
The Scouts have suffered a brutal, staggering blow.

268
00:17:25,894 --> 00:17:28,424
In exchange for the lives of many heroes,

269
00:17:28,449 --> 00:17:30,057
including Erwin Smith,

270
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:32,027
we have retaken Wall Maria

271
00:17:32,325 --> 00:17:35,985
and seized control of the Colossal
Titan, with all its fearsome strength.

272
00:17:36,285 --> 00:17:39,227
That said, we humans living inside the walls

273
00:17:39,282 --> 00:17:42,046
have just learned how precarious our situation is.

274
00:17:42,277 --> 00:17:46,203
I'd be relieved if Titans were
the only monsters we had for enemies.

275
00:17:46,346 --> 00:17:50,890
Unfortunately, the true nature
of the foe we face... is human.

276
00:17:51,304 --> 00:17:53,088
It's a whole civilization.

277
00:17:53,277 --> 00:17:56,180
One could say that it's us against the world.

278
00:17:57,417 --> 00:17:58,978
According to these books,

279
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:01,766
we're of a special race that can turn into Titans,

280
00:18:01,844 --> 00:18:03,633
called the Subjects of Ymir.

281
00:18:04,535 --> 00:18:07,423
We ruled the world once, and some fear we will again.

282
00:18:08,085 --> 00:18:10,696
So despite our past century of pacifism,

283
00:18:10,861 --> 00:18:13,796
most in this world would like to wipe us out.

284
00:18:16,836 --> 00:18:19,324
If Marley takes hold of the Founding Titan,

285
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,588
the Eldian race will be finished.

286
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:26,109
But if they try, the king in the walls will stop them.

287
00:18:26,917 --> 00:18:28,458
The king in the walls won't fight.

288
00:18:28,571 --> 00:18:28,881
Huh?

289
00:18:30,282 --> 00:18:32,727
"If Eldia is driven to sin once again,

290
00:18:32,853 --> 00:18:35,713
it shall perish, as is meant to be.

291
00:18:36,508 --> 00:18:40,504
I've made a vow, renouncing
war through the Founding Titan."

292
00:18:41,101 --> 00:18:44,008
He said that to the royal family still on the continent,

293
00:18:44,501 --> 00:18:46,343
and then he closed his gates.

294
00:18:47,869 --> 00:18:50,721
But what about the Titans he
threatened to send out from the walls?

295
00:18:51,026 --> 00:18:52,698
It was the last warning he gave.

296
00:18:53,427 --> 00:18:55,869
Those words were simply meant to deter an attack.

297
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:58,411
They afforded him a brief time of peace.

298
00:19:00,907 --> 00:19:03,569
The king of the walls stole his people's memories,

299
00:19:03,732 --> 00:19:06,658
and told them that beyond the walls, humanity was gone.

300
00:19:07,442 --> 00:19:09,415
Surrounded by fools of his making,

301
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:11,855
he tells them they're in paradise.

302
00:19:12,849 --> 00:19:15,550
A king that can't protect his people is no king.

303
00:19:16,135 --> 00:19:17,552
You must find that coward

304
00:19:17,867 --> 00:19:20,190
and strip him of the Founding Titan's power.

305
00:19:20,724 --> 00:19:22,947
That's the mission I'm entrusting to you.

306
00:19:25,003 --> 00:19:27,722
Doctor Jaeger did manage to achieve this mission,

307
00:19:27,985 --> 00:19:30,861
and he passed the Founding Titan on to his son Eren.

308
00:19:32,191 --> 00:19:35,398
The Founding Titan's full
might can only be brought to bear

309
00:19:35,606 --> 00:19:38,687
when the power is possessed by someone of royal blood.

310
00:19:39,732 --> 00:19:43,232
However, when a royal comes to possess the Founding Titan,

311
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:45,878
they're overpowered by their ancestor's will,

312
00:19:46,042 --> 00:19:48,396
and they continue down the path he set before them.

313
00:19:49,619 --> 00:19:52,710
Such is the power of his vow renouncing war.

314
00:19:54,476 --> 00:20:00,631
However, Eren has commanded Pure Titans once
in the past to escape from a dire situation.

315
00:20:01,686 --> 00:20:04,019
So despite his lack of royal blood,

316
00:20:04,168 --> 00:20:07,908
it's at least conditionally possible
for Eren to wield that power, too.

317
00:20:08,844 --> 00:20:09,878
That's right.

318
00:20:10,691 --> 00:20:15,455
If only for an instant, it felt like everything connected.

319
00:20:16,785 --> 00:20:19,857
Why? Why only then?

320
00:20:23,756 --> 00:20:26,153
I'm here as a descendant of the royal family.

321
00:20:26,466 --> 00:20:29,046
The last that stayed. My name's Dina Fritz.

322
00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:30,540
There's no way!

323
00:20:33,403 --> 00:20:34,389
You scared me.

324
00:20:34,761 --> 00:20:36,266
What is it? What's wrong?

325
00:20:36,503 --> 00:20:37,831
Oh, uh...

326
00:20:38,393 --> 00:20:39,379
I just...

327
00:20:42,437 --> 00:20:45,353
If you've something to say, we would be glad to hear it.

328
00:20:50,157 --> 00:20:51,615
Actually, it's nothing.

329
00:20:51,699 --> 00:20:52,178
Huh?

330
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:56,055
Sorry for interrupting, Commander.

331
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:03,492
Oh. I get it now.

332
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:04,594
That's right.

333
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:09,990
It would appear that Jaeger here
is going through an awkward phase.

334
00:21:10,199 --> 00:21:13,460
He speaks out of turn and often
makes a nuisance of himself.

335
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,198
Ah. I see.

336
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:18,974
That's rather unfortunate. But he is at that age.

337
00:21:19,151 --> 00:21:19,776
Eren?

338
00:21:21,109 --> 00:21:23,582
I haven't told those two about it yet, either.

339
00:21:24,532 --> 00:21:27,380
About how the Titan who killed my mother and Hannes

340
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:30,869
was actually someone my dad had been married to.

341
00:21:32,184 --> 00:21:35,661
The thing is, I can't talk about it here.

342
00:21:36,532 --> 00:21:39,667
If someone with royal blood is turned into a Titan,

343
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:45,274
then it might be possible for me to use the
Founding Titan's powers while touching them.

344
00:21:46,064 --> 00:21:48,833
Who knows... It might not work at all.

345
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:52,686
But if the military knew it was a possibility,

346
00:21:52,915 --> 00:21:55,053
what would they do to Historia?

347
00:22:01,175 --> 00:22:02,298
Build a family.

348
00:22:03,205 --> 00:22:03,731
Huh?

349
00:22:03,842 --> 00:22:06,597
After you've entered the walls, you should start a family.

350
00:22:06,911 --> 00:22:08,286
What are you talking about?

351
00:22:08,417 --> 00:22:09,773
I'm still married to Dina.

352
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,519
And you're about to transform me, right?

353
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:15,471
So won't I just forget everything
you're telling me now, anyway?

354
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:17,257
That's not always the case.

355
00:22:17,512 --> 00:22:19,554
And it's possible someone else'll see it.

356
00:22:19,724 --> 00:22:20,110
Huh?

357
00:22:20,651 --> 00:22:23,931
Be it your wife, your child, or even a stranger.

358
00:22:24,361 --> 00:22:26,504
Love someone in those walls.

359
00:22:28,439 --> 00:22:31,314
If you can't do that, it'll only repeat itself.

360
00:22:31,469 --> 00:22:34,490
This cruel history, these foolish mistakes...

361
00:22:34,651 --> 00:22:35,508
They'll repeat.

362
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,915
You have to see this through.

363
00:22:38,379 --> 00:22:41,365
Complete your mission and save Mikasa and Armin.

364
00:22:42,044 --> 00:22:45,036
Mikasa? Armin? Who are they?

365
00:22:48,987 --> 00:22:51,479
I... I don't know.

366
00:22:52,286 --> 00:22:53,935
They aren't from my memories.

367
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:44,531
They believed freedom could be won through war.

368
00:23:45,184 --> 00:23:46,952
Knowing the truth about humanity,

369
00:23:47,407 --> 00:23:49,198
when they finally reach the sea,

370
00:23:49,883 --> 00:23:52,095
what will they make of the world beyond it?

371
00:23:52,778 --> 00:23:55,801
