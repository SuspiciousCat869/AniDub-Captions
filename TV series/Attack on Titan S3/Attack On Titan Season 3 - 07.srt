1
00:01:39,236 --> 00:01:42,317
All right Historia, it seems we're finally alone.

2
00:01:43,246 --> 00:01:43,968
Father.

3
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:46,629
I'm sorry for making you wait.

4
00:01:47,699 --> 00:01:49,020
Listen, Historia.

5
00:01:49,819 --> 00:01:52,292
I imagine that this will sound strange to you,

6
00:01:52,858 --> 00:01:55,009
but Frieda isn't entirely dead.

7
00:01:57,027 --> 00:01:59,689
Your sister's memories are still alive.

8
00:02:00,377 --> 00:02:02,699
Would you like the chance to meet her again?

9
00:02:04,069 --> 00:02:04,876
Yes!

10
00:02:14,872 --> 00:02:17,939
Understand, Eren? Think of your mother.

11
00:02:18,626 --> 00:02:20,569
You can avenge her!

12
00:02:32,368 --> 00:02:33,678
Here they come.

13
00:02:35,394 --> 00:02:36,156
Wait.

14
00:02:40,836 --> 00:02:41,806
What are those?

15
00:02:46,486 --> 00:02:47,427
Shit.

16
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:52,084
Damn it.

17
00:02:52,486 --> 00:02:53,744
Gunpowder.

18
00:02:54,152 --> 00:02:58,035
Judging from those fires, the
barrels must have bags of oil on them.

19
00:02:59,017 --> 00:03:00,697
This could get ugly.

20
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:04,703
...Here they come!

21
00:03:04,771 --> 00:03:05,551
...Shoot 'em down!

22
00:03:06,283 --> 00:03:07,252
Huh?

23
00:03:08,656 --> 00:03:10,278
Signal flares?

24
00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:15,166
We can't shoot if we can't see our targets.

25
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,742
Twenty-four. Thirty-two.

26
00:03:21,054 --> 00:03:24,437
Thirty-five total! In the upper parts of the pillars!

27
00:03:25,407 --> 00:03:28,816
Continue the plan! We'll take them all out right here!

28
00:03:28,848 --> 00:03:30,128
Everyone scatter!

29
00:03:30,309 --> 00:03:32,335
Let them spread out, then surround them!

30
00:03:41,655 --> 00:03:42,990
I can't see shit!

31
00:03:43,642 --> 00:03:45,293
Damn it! Where'd they go?

32
00:03:48,402 --> 00:03:51,339
The Anti-Personnel ODM gear has a big weakness.

33
00:03:51,537 --> 00:03:56,624
The anchor points in the same direction as the gun,
so once its deployed, the gun can't be aimed again.

34
00:03:57,486 --> 00:03:59,222
Which means that while the user's moving,

35
00:03:59,295 --> 00:04:01,954
they're vulnerable to an attack from behind.

36
00:04:02,194 --> 00:04:02,867
Huh?

37
00:04:13,361 --> 00:04:15,491
Look over there! Fire!

38
00:04:18,311 --> 00:04:19,137
I missed?

39
00:04:20,563 --> 00:04:21,402
Lost him!

40
00:04:26,822 --> 00:04:27,518
Die!

41
00:04:35,662 --> 00:04:36,464
Sasha!

42
00:04:36,641 --> 00:04:39,921
Conny! Get back into the smoke before they shoot you!

43
00:04:41,294 --> 00:04:42,487
Take this!

44
00:04:46,402 --> 00:04:47,446
Damn it!

45
00:04:48,615 --> 00:04:50,282
But their greatest weakness

46
00:04:50,598 --> 00:04:53,024
is that once they've fired twice...

47
00:04:53,979 --> 00:04:56,729
...they need a few seconds to reload their weapons.

48
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:03,363
We're getting slaughtered.

49
00:05:03,561 --> 00:05:04,919
Damn, she's fast!

50
00:05:13,532 --> 00:05:15,323
Once they've closed the range gap,

51
00:05:15,361 --> 00:05:16,893
swords have the advantage.

52
00:05:21,355 --> 00:05:23,105
We have to stop them!

53
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,445
At this rate, they'll wipe us out!

54
00:05:31,896 --> 00:05:33,011
Woo hoo!

55
00:05:38,794 --> 00:05:39,908
Hey Levi.

56
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:43,620
I don't exactly have time to waste on ya.

57
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:47,266
But I just can't have ya getting' any further.

58
00:05:50,935 --> 00:05:53,732
So be it. I'll just have to play.

59
00:05:55,632 --> 00:05:57,299
Catch me if ya can, boy!

60
00:06:03,869 --> 00:06:06,309
You're a lively one. Damn.

61
00:06:09,686 --> 00:06:10,090
Tch.

62
00:06:22,533 --> 00:06:26,116
Ain't you tired of this game yet? All right.

63
00:06:29,136 --> 00:06:30,710
I taught ya this one.

64
00:06:30,888 --> 00:06:34,498
When you're chasin' your enemy, you
shouldn't just stare straight ahead!

65
00:06:40,822 --> 00:06:42,055
Here, dimwit!

66
00:07:03,367 --> 00:07:05,663
You bastard.

67
00:07:06,249 --> 00:07:07,967
That really hurt.

68
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:13,194
They know our weaknesses.

69
00:07:13,324 --> 00:07:14,843
Maybe I can use that.

70
00:07:20,976 --> 00:07:24,255
Huh? Those shots weren't even close to hitting!

71
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:28,864
Heh. It looks like I've found another reckless spirit!

72
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,887
Hange!

73
00:07:53,777 --> 00:07:57,187
Now! We'll re-form our defense at the fallback point!

74
00:07:57,699 --> 00:07:58,855
Time to regroup!

75
00:08:08,236 --> 00:08:10,835
Stay out of our damn way, you little runt.

76
00:08:18,004 --> 00:08:19,169
Let it down!

77
00:08:23,572 --> 00:08:25,200
You guard the ritual site!

78
00:08:25,637 --> 00:08:27,974
Will do. You try not to die.

79
00:08:36,361 --> 00:08:38,723
It sounds like the enemy's drawing near.

80
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:41,084
This is it, we need to hurry.

81
00:08:41,142 --> 00:08:41,775
Right.

82
00:08:48,082 --> 00:08:51,370
What's the matter? Why are you glaring like that?

83
00:08:51,611 --> 00:08:55,786
Because, he's realized what it is that we have to do.

84
00:08:56,111 --> 00:09:01,125
The power his father stole for him
must be returned to its rightful place.

85
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:05,344
Historia. That place is with you.

86
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:14,914
The cavern we're in now was built around a century ago

87
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:17,976
using the Titan power of our ancestor.

88
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:22,695
The very same power was employed to build the three walls.

89
00:09:23,299 --> 00:09:27,119
And it's thanks to those enormous
walls that humanity has survived.

90
00:09:27,849 --> 00:09:31,999
The voice of this "Founding Titan"
reached out to touch the people's hearts

91
00:09:32,944 --> 00:09:35,111
and altered their memories forever.

92
00:09:36,191 --> 00:09:39,775
Understand that although a few bloodlines were exempt,

93
00:09:40,074 --> 00:09:42,778
even their knowledge was lost over time.

94
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:46,999
Today, humanity knows nothing
of the world before the walls.

95
00:09:48,643 --> 00:09:52,305
The only exception is your sister, Frieda Reiss.

96
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:57,612
Frieda possessed far more than
the power to become a Titan.

97
00:09:58,652 --> 00:10:01,313
She knew what this world was once like.

98
00:10:01,558 --> 00:10:04,468
And she knew what brought it to its current state.

99
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:10,158
She was only fifteen years old when she
took the burden of that knowledge upon herself.

100
00:10:11,358 --> 00:10:15,234
It was eight years ago, that she performed the ritual.

101
00:10:15,902 --> 00:10:18,849
In this very chamber, she ate her uncle.

102
00:10:19,123 --> 00:10:20,676
My younger brother.

103
00:10:36,876 --> 00:10:40,330
In doing so, Frieda inherited the Founding Titan

104
00:10:40,925 --> 00:10:43,263
and the memories of this world.

105
00:10:43,694 --> 00:10:45,812
As her uncle had before her.

106
00:10:46,259 --> 00:10:49,396
As our ancestors have for a hundred years.

107
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:54,625
Does that mean...?

108
00:10:56,635 --> 00:10:57,579
It's true.

109
00:10:57,902 --> 00:11:04,048
Had she survived, Frieda could have used her
tremendous powers to eliminate humanity's woes with ease.

110
00:11:05,089 --> 00:11:09,030
In time, she could've wiped the Titan
scourge from the face of the world.

111
00:11:09,451 --> 00:11:13,907
But then his father came and stole that power away.

112
00:11:15,362 --> 00:11:18,586
Now, that power resides within Eren.

113
00:11:19,152 --> 00:11:20,876
But it's wasted with him.

114
00:11:21,336 --> 00:11:25,970
The Founding Titan's might can only
be wielded by a member of <i>our</i> bloodline.

115
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:30,411
As long as <i>he</i> remains the vessel for that power,

116
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,891
this hell will never end.

117
00:11:36,307 --> 00:11:36,944
Then...

118
00:11:38,167 --> 00:11:40,463
Hey, hey, hey, just a damn minute!

119
00:11:42,319 --> 00:11:43,005
Kenny.

120
00:11:43,325 --> 00:11:48,512
Sounds like you said that if someone who isn't a
Reiss eats Eren, they won't get the powers of the king.

121
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,277
Yes, that's right.

122
00:11:50,753 --> 00:11:51,991
So then, what?

123
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:54,749
Even if I do turn into a Titan and eat Eren,

124
00:11:55,138 --> 00:11:56,853
it ain't gonna do me any good?!

125
00:11:56,878 --> 00:11:58,491
What are you saying?

126
00:12:00,969 --> 00:12:01,954
Let him go!

127
00:12:02,123 --> 00:12:04,951
What the hell's gotten into you? Do you think I'm lying?

128
00:12:04,983 --> 00:12:08,375
No, I don't. I waited a long time for this day

129
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:12,301
because I knew if there was one thing you
weren't lying about, it was the succession ritual.

130
00:12:13,047 --> 00:12:14,642
Damn. You prick.

131
00:12:14,746 --> 00:12:16,711
You knew what I was after this whole time.

132
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:21,005
And you knew I didn't have a chance in hell of
gettin' it. But'cha went ahead and used me, huh?

133
00:12:22,277 --> 00:12:23,927
I'm very grateful.

134
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:29,103
When my brother first brought you into his service, I
thought it was just one of his foolish whims, but y...

135
00:12:29,211 --> 00:12:31,221
You keep on talkin' shit about Uri,

136
00:12:31,421 --> 00:12:33,701
and you can kiss this half of your head goodbye!

137
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,794
Stop it! Get away from my father!

138
00:12:39,388 --> 00:12:44,150
Come on. This is pitiful. Don't you get it yet, Historia?

139
00:12:44,475 --> 00:12:46,302
Your daddy doesn't give a damn!

140
00:12:46,993 --> 00:12:49,377
He brought you here so he can turn you into a monster.

141
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,556
And after that he's gonna make you eat your buddy Eren.

142
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:01,230
If that's my duty then that's what I'll do.

143
00:13:01,595 --> 00:13:02,286
Yeah?

144
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:06,029
Yeah. I've decided.

145
00:13:06,656 --> 00:13:09,194
I'll eat Eren and bring my sister back!

146
00:13:09,335 --> 00:13:11,176
I'll inherit the world's history,

147
00:13:12,075 --> 00:13:14,457
and exterminate every last Titan!

148
00:13:15,205 --> 00:13:18,113
If that's my duty, then... I'll do it!

149
00:13:20,035 --> 00:13:22,365
Damn it, Historia, think about this.

150
00:13:22,483 --> 00:13:24,907
What the hell has this old bastard ever done for you?

151
00:13:26,329 --> 00:13:29,555
Only reason he picked you up is
'cause of that royal blood of yours.

152
00:13:29,793 --> 00:13:32,996
This piece of trash is too
scared to turn into a Titan himself.

153
00:13:33,408 --> 00:13:35,941
That's why he forced his brother
and daughter to do it for him!

154
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:38,842
That's the kind of man your daddy is.

155
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:40,479
Ah.

156
00:13:41,575 --> 00:13:44,569
He's wrong, Historia. That isn't the truth.

157
00:13:44,721 --> 00:13:48,169
It's essential that I do not become a Titan myself.

158
00:13:48,319 --> 00:13:49,710
You mustn't believe him.

159
00:13:50,191 --> 00:13:52,514
I'm the only man alive you can trust.

160
00:13:56,297 --> 00:13:56,952
Hmm. Is

161
00:13:56,976 --> 00:13:58,051
that so?

162
00:13:58,748 --> 00:13:59,363
Father!

163
00:14:03,487 --> 00:14:07,476
Kenny. You served me well up to this moment.

164
00:14:08,002 --> 00:14:09,248
You're free now.

165
00:14:10,274 --> 00:14:12,879
Go find another purpose for your life,

166
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:14,897
and live out your years.

167
00:14:20,182 --> 00:14:22,604
That'd bore me to death. So...

168
00:14:28,486 --> 00:14:31,796
Kenny. Just what are you planning to do?

169
00:14:32,211 --> 00:14:34,099
If she wants to turn into a Titan,

170
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,540
well, then that's her choice to make.

171
00:14:40,525 --> 00:14:43,246
But I say the boy should get a fair shot.

172
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,479
They can both turn Titan and fight it out.

173
00:14:47,652 --> 00:14:51,302
If Historia wins, well, then you'll have your peace.

174
00:14:51,953 --> 00:14:56,124
But if Eren takes her down, the situation stays the same.

175
00:14:59,944 --> 00:15:02,557
Go on livin' for the sake of drawin' breath?

176
00:15:03,421 --> 00:15:06,061
That doesn't sound like any kind of life to me.

177
00:15:07,602 --> 00:15:12,139
Historia! Take this injection
and you'll become a powerful Titan!

178
00:15:12,219 --> 00:15:15,277
If you can remember, it's not
enough just to bite him anywhere.

179
00:15:15,402 --> 00:15:18,542
To take his powers, you have to consume his spinal fluid!

180
00:15:20,933 --> 00:15:22,664
Reckon I'd better step back.

181
00:15:24,986 --> 00:15:26,906
Go on, you have to hurry!

182
00:15:33,406 --> 00:15:34,447
Eren, why?

183
00:15:36,139 --> 00:15:37,815
Why aren't you transforming?

184
00:15:39,112 --> 00:15:40,740
You're gonna fight back, aren't you?

185
00:15:41,361 --> 00:15:42,749
You can't just let me.

186
00:15:43,277 --> 00:15:44,577
Defend yourself!

187
00:15:49,462 --> 00:15:51,871
Historia! This is your chance!

188
00:15:52,486 --> 00:15:54,541
It didn't have to be like this.

189
00:15:55,569 --> 00:15:56,368
Huh?

190
00:15:57,322 --> 00:16:00,562
All that death could've been avoided.

191
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:06,521
Five years ago, if Dad hadn't done what he did...

192
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:08,530
Your sister.

193
00:16:09,225 --> 00:16:12,384
She would've been able to do something to stop all this.

194
00:16:13,861 --> 00:16:17,922
But because my dad chose to steal your
family's power from its rightful owner,

195
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:20,597
countless people ended up getting killed.

196
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:27,179
Armin's grandpa. Thomas, Nack, Mina, Milieus.

197
00:16:28,042 --> 00:16:31,278
Marco. Everyone on Levi Squad.

198
00:16:31,787 --> 00:16:33,370
The people of Stohess.

199
00:16:33,398 --> 00:16:35,447
The soldiers who came to save me.

200
00:16:36,276 --> 00:16:37,338
And Hannes.

201
00:16:39,334 --> 00:16:42,788
I can never atone for all of their pain.

202
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:45,475
That never should've happened.

203
00:16:46,545 --> 00:16:48,836
Those days I spent in training.

204
00:16:49,438 --> 00:16:52,911
That stupid dream that I could see the world.

205
00:16:55,032 --> 00:16:58,798
And me. I shouldn't have happened.

206
00:17:09,213 --> 00:17:10,650
If nothing else,

207
00:17:11,261 --> 00:17:15,063
then at least let it end at your hand.

208
00:17:16,315 --> 00:17:20,745
Take your power back, then use it to save humanity.

209
00:17:25,402 --> 00:17:28,180
It's all up to you.

210
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:38,945
Eren. I remember.

211
00:17:40,275 --> 00:17:44,697
When you said I was a normal girl, I was so happy.

212
00:17:51,444 --> 00:17:54,730
I see. This your idea of trying to be nice?

213
00:18:01,358 --> 00:18:04,654
What's wrong, Historia? Are you scared?

214
00:18:05,465 --> 00:18:08,746
All you have to do is inject the liquid into your body.

215
00:18:10,446 --> 00:18:12,781
Wait. Father.

216
00:18:14,745 --> 00:18:18,066
For a hundred years we had the power,

217
00:18:18,716 --> 00:18:20,344
but we didn't use it.

218
00:18:20,642 --> 00:18:22,711
Why didn't our family do something?

219
00:18:23,459 --> 00:18:25,358
If we could control the Titans,

220
00:18:25,566 --> 00:18:27,756
then why didn't we liberate humanity?

221
00:18:31,357 --> 00:18:36,466
That's because the same king who built
this world within the walls for humanity,

222
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:40,533
wanted us to live in fear of the Titans for all of time.

223
00:18:41,486 --> 00:18:45,508
The First King believed this to
be the only path to lasting peace.

224
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:48,345
But I can't tell you why.

225
00:18:48,944 --> 00:18:52,603
Because only those who've seen
the world's memories can know!

226
00:18:54,510 --> 00:19:00,587
Many years ago, my brother and I pleaded
with our father to free humanity from the Titans.

227
00:19:01,003 --> 00:19:03,343
We asked him time and time again.

228
00:19:04,222 --> 00:19:06,769
However, he would not fulfill our wish.

229
00:19:09,182 --> 00:19:12,742
Eventually, the time came for one of us to succeed him.

230
00:19:13,767 --> 00:19:16,039
After my brother completed the ritual,

231
00:19:16,404 --> 00:19:19,353
when I looked into his eyes, I understood.

232
00:19:21,443 --> 00:19:26,012
My brother wasn't there. He had become something greater.

233
00:19:26,321 --> 00:19:31,073
An omniscient being, exempt from death,
who built and rules over the world we live in.

234
00:19:31,925 --> 00:19:34,537
Do you know what such a being is called?

235
00:19:36,199 --> 00:19:36,960
God.

236
00:19:37,836 --> 00:19:41,400
There is no other word aside from God.

237
00:19:41,586 --> 00:19:45,555
So now it's my sacred duty to
bring God back to this world,

238
00:19:45,714 --> 00:19:48,147
and then to offer up my prayers.

239
00:19:48,368 --> 00:19:50,784
I'm praying right now, Historia,

240
00:19:51,491 --> 00:19:55,432
for God to return and lead mankind once again!

241
00:19:57,902 --> 00:19:58,714
Christa.

242
00:19:59,849 --> 00:20:02,511
I have no business telling you how to live your life.

243
00:20:02,683 --> 00:20:03,828
It's not my place.

244
00:20:05,153 --> 00:20:07,094
So I guess when you break it down,

245
00:20:07,376 --> 00:20:09,286
this is really just more of a hope.

246
00:20:13,732 --> 00:20:16,753
Christa, live a life you can be proud of.

247
00:20:31,089 --> 00:20:32,962
What have you done?!

248
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:38,785
God my ass!

249
00:20:38,914 --> 00:20:40,794
If it's such an honor to become him,

250
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:42,622
then why didn't you do it yourself?

251
00:20:42,882 --> 00:20:44,507
I'm done with your shit,

252
00:20:44,725 --> 00:20:46,739
and I'm not gonna let you murder me!

253
00:20:53,884 --> 00:20:56,661
That's the spirit! This is gettin' good!

254
00:20:59,004 --> 00:21:01,095
The hell are you doing, Historia?

255
00:21:01,444 --> 00:21:02,707
Setting you free.

256
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:04,720
No, stop! You can't!

257
00:21:04,861 --> 00:21:07,816
If you don't kill me, then
everyone else'll keep suffering!

258
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:10,027
Just eat me already, damn it!

259
00:21:10,136 --> 00:21:12,306
I can't live like this, so end it!

260
00:21:12,361 --> 00:21:13,394
Shut up, dumbass!

261
00:21:13,743 --> 00:21:15,858
Stop your crying! I don't care!

262
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:19,694
I don't care about killing all the Titans!

263
00:21:19,794 --> 00:21:22,109
And I don't care about freeing mankind either!

264
00:21:22,194 --> 00:21:24,201
I'm starting to get sick of humanity!

265
00:21:24,274 --> 00:21:26,639
I say let 'em get wiped out by Titans!

266
00:21:26,717 --> 00:21:29,156
And if that makes me an enemy of humanity?

267
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:33,249
So be it. I don't care if I'm
the worst girl who's ever lived!

268
00:21:35,011 --> 00:21:38,406
You get the hell out of here. I'll deal with the rest.

269
00:21:42,444 --> 00:21:43,608
Father.

270
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,724
Uri. And Frieda.

271
00:21:48,399 --> 00:21:51,299
I'm coming. Just wait.

272
00:23:40,777 --> 00:23:43,119
Rod Reiss becomes a Titan.

273
00:23:44,044 --> 00:23:46,944
To protect Mikasa and the others from a cave-in,

274
00:23:47,377 --> 00:23:50,634
Eren is forced to make yet another hard choice.

275
00:23:51,238 --> 00:23:54,904
Next episode: "Outside the Walls of Orvud District."
