1
00:01:52,389 --> 00:01:53,319
Commander.

2
00:01:53,639 --> 00:01:54,819
He's about to climb.

3
00:02:11,055 --> 00:02:11,964
Soldiers!

4
00:02:12,123 --> 00:02:14,698
You are not yet to engage the Armored Titan!

5
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,857
Maintain a safe distance.

6
00:02:17,097 --> 00:02:18,152
Yes, sir!

7
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,527
Hange.

8
00:02:19,972 --> 00:02:21,704
Why doesn't he have us attack?

9
00:02:22,139 --> 00:02:23,215
What's he thinking?

10
00:02:23,277 --> 00:02:25,250
The enemy prepared quite the welcome.

11
00:02:26,155 --> 00:02:28,024
He's watching their movements for now.

12
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:31,344
Erwin doesn't want to act until
he understands their strategy.

13
00:02:37,946 --> 00:02:40,933
That quadruped type has some kind of cargo on its back,

14
00:02:41,389 --> 00:02:43,864
which tells me that it didn't transform just now.

15
00:02:45,347 --> 00:02:47,828
It's also likely that this was the enemy's scout.

16
00:02:48,847 --> 00:02:52,461
But for it to take notice of our approach
and relay that information to Reiner...

17
00:02:53,347 --> 00:02:54,383
That must mean...

18
00:02:55,555 --> 00:02:57,490
They have one more intelligent Titan.

19
00:02:57,847 --> 00:02:59,388
It's that quadruped type.

20
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,480
Though there may well be others.

21
00:03:03,394 --> 00:03:05,467
That Titan is carrying cargo.

22
00:03:06,347 --> 00:03:07,461
What could it be?

23
00:03:23,389 --> 00:03:24,327
Get ready!

24
00:03:24,612 --> 00:03:26,717
Multiple two- to three- meters approaching!

25
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,555
This is just like the siege of Utgard Castle.

26
00:03:31,389 --> 00:03:33,273
They'll start by targeting the horses.

27
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:36,681
Their primary objective is still to capture Eren.

28
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:38,890
But towards that end,

29
00:03:39,206 --> 00:03:41,694
they intend to eliminate our only chance of escape.

30
00:03:44,022 --> 00:03:48,186
As of five years ago, Wall Maria's
perimeter is deep in Titan territory.

31
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:51,921
So, if they do wipe out our horses,
we'll have no means of getting back.

32
00:03:52,472 --> 00:03:54,509
Not only would this block our escape route,

33
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:56,518
it would cut off our supply lines.

34
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:59,962
It might take a week or a month,

35
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,675
but there will come a point at which none of us can move.

36
00:04:03,476 --> 00:04:05,871
They'll forgo the risks of a proper battle,

37
00:04:06,389 --> 00:04:09,652
and opt instead to take Eren once he's too weak to resist.

38
00:04:11,761 --> 00:04:13,136
I'm sure of it now.

39
00:04:13,514 --> 00:04:17,367
The proof is in the fact that those
larger Titans are still standing in formation.

40
00:04:17,998 --> 00:04:20,425
Their only purpose is to prevent our retreat.

41
00:04:24,144 --> 00:04:24,820
Sir.

42
00:04:24,912 --> 00:04:25,653
What now?

43
00:04:25,805 --> 00:04:27,430
The Armored Titan is almost up!

44
00:04:27,514 --> 00:04:30,268
Bertholdt hasn't shown yet, but he must be nearby!

45
00:04:30,389 --> 00:04:32,247
Yes. I'm well aware.

46
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:36,236
At this point, the thing I fear most

47
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,224
is that Reiner and Bertholdt will reach
our horses and slaughter them unchecked.

48
00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:42,059
Therefore...

49
00:04:44,305 --> 00:04:46,597
You finally ready to say something, Erwin?

50
00:04:46,772 --> 00:04:49,251
Been waiting so long, I could've made breakfast.

51
00:04:51,055 --> 00:04:53,382
Dirk Squad and Marlene Squad, too!

52
00:04:53,469 --> 00:04:56,027
Join Klaus Squad and protect the horses at the gate!

53
00:04:56,889 --> 00:04:58,822
Levi Squad and Hange Squad!

54
00:04:59,139 --> 00:05:01,277
I need you to take down the Armored Titan.

55
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:04,010
Employ the Thunder Spears at your own discretion.

56
00:05:04,222 --> 00:05:06,680
Do whatever it takes to achieve your objective!

57
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:08,309
This is our moment.

58
00:05:08,514 --> 00:05:09,874
Our chance to strike.

59
00:05:10,054 --> 00:05:12,534
The fate of humankind depends on this battle!

60
00:05:12,927 --> 00:05:14,815
Lay down your hearts and lives...

61
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,180
...one final time, for humanity!

62
00:05:18,264 --> 00:05:19,445
Yes, sir!

63
00:05:21,097 --> 00:05:21,656
Hear that?

64
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:25,145
We'll turn the tables on the
Titans as they come for our horses!

65
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:25,861
Sir!

66
00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:27,656
Hey. Hold on, you two.

67
00:05:28,724 --> 00:05:30,358
Hange can lead both your squads.

68
00:05:30,437 --> 00:05:32,413
I'm going to need you right here, Levi.

69
00:05:33,139 --> 00:05:35,630
So I'll protect the horses instead of Eren?

70
00:05:35,733 --> 00:05:36,417
That's right.

71
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,079
And when the chance arises, you'll strike him down.

72
00:05:41,305 --> 00:05:44,481
You're the only soldier I can
trust to dispatch the Beast Titan.

73
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,119
Understood, sir.

74
00:05:48,836 --> 00:05:51,797
I wasn't fast enough to finish
off the Armored one earlier,

75
00:05:52,062 --> 00:05:54,531
but I'll atone for that by taking the Beast Titan's head.

76
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:58,711
Armin.

77
00:05:59,069 --> 00:06:01,022
I have a plan for the Armored Titan, too.

78
00:06:01,365 --> 00:06:02,205
Uh... sir.

79
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,312
We have to win on two fronts to secure victory.

80
00:06:05,847 --> 00:06:07,069
I can handle one.

81
00:06:07,389 --> 00:06:09,619
The other, I'll leave to you and Hange.

82
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:29,481
There they are.

83
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,785
Gathered up in one place.

84
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,963
I'll kill the horses and make a break for it.

85
00:06:35,764 --> 00:06:36,806
That's good enough.

86
00:06:37,698 --> 00:06:40,080
No matter how strong Captain Levi is,

87
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,010
he's still no match for our War Chief.

88
00:06:48,222 --> 00:06:49,527
That was a close one.

89
00:06:50,347 --> 00:06:53,801
If I was any slower in transferring
my consciousness to my body,

90
00:06:54,311 --> 00:06:55,748
I'd've died instantly.

91
00:06:57,264 --> 00:07:00,084
How did they even think to check inside the walls?

92
00:07:02,671 --> 00:07:03,534
Armin.

93
00:07:04,222 --> 00:07:05,139
Was it you?

94
00:07:07,878 --> 00:07:09,342
It doesn't matter now.

95
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:14,545
Once this is done, our long journey will reach its end.

96
00:07:22,911 --> 00:07:24,485
Erwin Smith.

97
00:07:25,472 --> 00:07:27,019
Can't let him distract me.

98
00:07:27,472 --> 00:07:29,426
I've got to kill those horses.

99
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:37,887
Eren!

100
00:07:41,764 --> 00:07:44,013
Why would he show up when he doesn't have to?

101
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,040
They should be painfully aware that
abducting him is our main objective.

102
00:07:49,353 --> 00:07:50,615
What is he thinking?

103
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,957
Will he run south and climb over the wall?

104
00:07:59,605 --> 00:08:03,286
As a Titan, he could circle around
and escape to Trost without a horse.

105
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:05,701
Were that to happen,

106
00:08:06,229 --> 00:08:08,594
we'd have no reason to stay here and fight.

107
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:12,123
Even if we did manage to annihilate the Scouts,

108
00:08:12,847 --> 00:08:15,237
Eren mastered hardening in two months.

109
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,612
We can't let him back in the walls.

110
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:18,923
No way.

111
00:08:19,472 --> 00:08:23,133
If he learns how to harness the
Coordinate's full power, we're finished.

112
00:08:25,264 --> 00:08:26,017
Hold on.

113
00:08:26,389 --> 00:08:27,566
Something's off here.

114
00:08:28,097 --> 00:08:33,551
If his goal really was to escape, he would've used
ODM gear to scale the south wall and then transformed.

115
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:39,079
But instead he transformed right in
front of me, in the center of town.

116
00:08:41,389 --> 00:08:42,433
I get it.

117
00:08:42,815 --> 00:08:44,077
He's a diversion.

118
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:48,589
They're trying to change my
target from the horses to Eren!

119
00:08:57,305 --> 00:09:00,006
You're not giving me any time to think, Commander.

120
00:09:01,055 --> 00:09:02,532
You clever bastard.

121
00:09:03,055 --> 00:09:05,216
Makin' me get down when I just climbed up.

122
00:09:11,522 --> 00:09:13,361
Good. He went for it!

123
00:09:14,655 --> 00:09:16,770
He wants to use Eren as bait?

124
00:09:17,305 --> 00:09:19,686
Yes, that was the Commander's order.

125
00:09:20,055 --> 00:09:20,846
Hold on.

126
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:24,953
So he's willing to risk Eren's
capture just to protect the horses?

127
00:09:25,014 --> 00:09:25,882
You're kidding.

128
00:09:26,328 --> 00:09:29,681
Even if we try it, Reiner might
just go after the horses anyway.

129
00:09:29,844 --> 00:09:30,483
No.

130
00:09:30,722 --> 00:09:32,175
I'm sure he'll chase Eren.

131
00:09:33,097 --> 00:09:35,274
If Reiner does go after the horses,

132
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:39,357
then Eren can continue running north and
wrap around the Beast Titan's formation.

133
00:09:39,972 --> 00:09:42,145
With Levi, the Scouts, and Eren,

134
00:09:42,313 --> 00:09:44,696
they can catch the Beast Titan in a pincer attack.

135
00:09:44,972 --> 00:09:47,580
Erwin must've said as much himself, right?

136
00:09:47,722 --> 00:09:48,923
Um, yes.

137
00:09:49,139 --> 00:09:51,083
Even if things don't go as we hope,

138
00:09:51,222 --> 00:09:53,347
the enemy doesn't expect Eren to flee,

139
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:56,305
so it might confuse them enough
to get them to break ranks.

140
00:09:56,436 --> 00:09:59,322
The only question is can Reiner see that far ahead.

141
00:10:04,055 --> 00:10:06,989
Knowing him, he should work it out pretty quickly.

142
00:10:08,264 --> 00:10:08,905
Okay.

143
00:10:09,581 --> 00:10:11,900
This is where we'll bring down the Armored Titan.

144
00:10:13,314 --> 00:10:14,340
Wait a second!

145
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:16,706
There's one more factor we need to consider.

146
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:20,878
He's still hiding, but Bertholdt must be nearby.

147
00:10:21,722 --> 00:10:23,047
The last time they fought,

148
00:10:23,154 --> 00:10:26,201
Eren outmaneuvered Reiner and
had him on the verge of defeat,

149
00:10:26,674 --> 00:10:29,163
but then Bertholdt caught him with a surprise attack,

150
00:10:29,555 --> 00:10:31,211
and he ended up their captive.

151
00:10:35,045 --> 00:10:36,666
As a simple counter-measure,

152
00:10:37,254 --> 00:10:40,137
do what you can to keep the fight away from the walls.

153
00:10:47,222 --> 00:10:49,059
It might've been a fluke,

154
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:52,482
but I've beaten you once before.

155
00:10:54,222 --> 00:10:56,168
And I'm stronger now.

156
00:10:58,389 --> 00:11:00,609
One-on-one, I can win.

157
00:11:02,055 --> 00:11:04,533
When it comes to hand-to-hand combat,

158
00:11:04,805 --> 00:11:07,330
Annie makes you look downright weak.

159
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:41,000
Do you have any idea where we're standing right now?

160
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:45,132
This place...

161
00:11:50,188 --> 00:11:51,743
...was my home.

162
00:11:52,823 --> 00:11:54,531
Was our home!

163
00:11:55,889 --> 00:11:58,058
But then you stole it!

164
00:12:00,174 --> 00:12:02,085
We're taking it back.

165
00:12:02,611 --> 00:12:04,491
And you can't stop us.

166
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:11,305
Get in our way, and we'll slaughter you all.

167
00:12:20,774 --> 00:12:23,506
Recruits! Keep moving with the horses!

168
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,486
We'll keep the Titans off your backs!

169
00:12:26,628 --> 00:12:27,460
Hey, Marlo!

170
00:12:27,484 --> 00:12:28,043
Huh?

171
00:12:28,197 --> 00:12:29,697
Where do we tie the horses?

172
00:12:29,746 --> 00:12:32,516
We were told to avoid putting
all of them in the same place.

173
00:12:33,097 --> 00:12:34,447
Just keep going, all right?

174
00:12:34,823 --> 00:12:36,965
Two more small ones coming from the east!

175
00:12:42,014 --> 00:12:44,886
So those... are Titans?

176
00:12:55,051 --> 00:12:56,239
It's Captain Levi!

177
00:12:56,472 --> 00:12:57,892
Now's our chance! Hurry!

178
00:12:58,229 --> 00:13:00,354
Finish killing the small ones already!

179
00:13:00,514 --> 00:13:02,604
Get it done before the Beast Titan moves!

180
00:13:02,676 --> 00:13:04,987
And no casualties! Don't you dare get eaten.

181
00:13:05,264 --> 00:13:05,972
Sir!

182
00:13:09,472 --> 00:13:10,215
Shit.

183
00:13:10,612 --> 00:13:12,066
Who the hell am I kidding?

184
00:13:12,537 --> 00:13:14,663
These kids are gonna drop like flies.

185
00:13:14,889 --> 00:13:16,332
Shoulda left 'em up there.

186
00:13:21,363 --> 00:13:23,872
We struggle against the smallest Titans now.

187
00:13:24,847 --> 00:13:26,398
The Scouts have grown weak.

188
00:13:26,929 --> 00:13:29,648
Most of our veterans have been buried, burned, or...

189
00:13:31,514 --> 00:13:34,717
Still, if not for the lives we sacrificed,

190
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:37,052
we never would have made it half this far.

191
00:13:42,847 --> 00:13:43,972
When I was a cadet,

192
00:13:44,472 --> 00:13:46,577
I told the others about my father's theory...

193
00:13:47,139 --> 00:13:48,008
My faith in it.

194
00:13:48,847 --> 00:13:52,052
I told them that once I was a
scout, I would prove he was right.

195
00:13:53,389 --> 00:13:55,261
But once I actually joined the Scouts,

196
00:13:56,014 --> 00:13:58,082
I stopped talking about it for some reason.

197
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:01,124
No, that's wrong.

198
00:14:03,514 --> 00:14:04,893
It wasn't "some reason."

199
00:14:05,647 --> 00:14:06,886
I'd realized something.

200
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,603
That of all my brave comrades,

201
00:14:10,264 --> 00:14:12,376
only one was fighting for himself.

202
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,878
They bled and died for each other,

203
00:14:15,514 --> 00:14:17,460
while I fought for a selfish dream.

204
00:14:21,889 --> 00:14:24,141
Then I came to lead my comrades.

205
00:14:24,502 --> 00:14:27,502
Gave them orders and inspiring words.

206
00:14:28,222 --> 00:14:29,036
Be brave.

207
00:14:29,472 --> 00:14:31,189
Give your hearts to humanity.

208
00:14:32,472 --> 00:14:34,248
I played them all for fools.

209
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,234
Myself, too.

210
00:14:37,597 --> 00:14:38,284
And now,

211
00:14:38,379 --> 00:14:41,009
standing on this mountain of brave corpses...

212
00:14:42,394 --> 00:14:43,757
...I have quite the view.

213
00:14:52,264 --> 00:14:52,879
Still,

214
00:14:53,597 --> 00:14:56,057
Grisha's secret lingers in the back of my mind.

215
00:14:56,986 --> 00:14:58,735
Even if this plan should fail,

216
00:14:59,445 --> 00:15:01,936
there's a chance that I could still reach that cellar.

217
00:15:03,764 --> 00:15:06,616
Before I die, I'd like to see it.

218
00:15:07,453 --> 00:15:08,944
The truth of our world.

219
00:15:18,472 --> 00:15:20,544
Those experiments paid off!

220
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:25,755
These fists are all I need to beat you!

221
00:15:28,914 --> 00:15:33,334
When I focus my hardening on one point, it gets stronger.

222
00:15:33,847 --> 00:15:37,014
Since his armor's spread across his whole body,

223
00:15:37,097 --> 00:15:39,769
I can smash it like thin ice!

224
00:15:45,847 --> 00:15:47,730
You're too slow, you stupid oaf.

225
00:15:47,812 --> 00:15:49,590
You won't win!

226
00:15:51,566 --> 00:15:52,989
Damn it, no!

227
00:16:38,805 --> 00:16:39,944
He needs our help!

228
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,136
Not yet!

229
00:16:41,194 --> 00:16:43,178
Everything rides on our first attack!

230
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,427
We need to wait and trust Eren to give us a good opening.

231
00:16:54,845 --> 00:16:57,303
Your new weapon is a big metal rod?

232
00:16:57,514 --> 00:16:59,767
It's pointy, dumbass. That makes it a spear.

233
00:16:59,886 --> 00:17:02,715
The Corps of Engineers really
came through for me with this one.

234
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:07,227
They've been going through a plethora of
technologies kept hidden by the Interior Police.

235
00:17:07,597 --> 00:17:09,395
And I told 'em that while they were at it,

236
00:17:09,597 --> 00:17:12,733
they should try to cook up a weapon
that'll work against the Armored Titan.

237
00:17:13,014 --> 00:17:14,822
And that's what they came up with?

238
00:17:15,555 --> 00:17:19,208
Our blades may as well have been
made of paper against that armor of his.

239
00:17:20,196 --> 00:17:24,745
All we could do in our last battle was watch
Eren fight the Armored Titan from the sidelines.

240
00:17:25,063 --> 00:17:28,247
There just aren't enough openings
in the plating for us to cut through.

241
00:17:31,472 --> 00:17:32,475
True enough.

242
00:17:32,597 --> 00:17:35,987
Even at close range, we couldn't
do anything to make him let Eren go.

243
00:17:37,972 --> 00:17:42,033
Back then, if the Commander hadn't
drawn that horde of Titans towards him...

244
00:17:44,139 --> 00:17:49,327
Until now, the only attacks that've hurt
Reiner did so by working around his armor.

245
00:17:49,514 --> 00:17:51,965
I'm referring to Eren's grappling techniques.

246
00:17:52,227 --> 00:17:55,945
Also, Eren's been experimenting
with a new "hardened punch,"

247
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:57,566
for which we have high hopes.

248
00:17:58,248 --> 00:18:00,822
With that said, if those were our sole weapons,

249
00:18:00,847 --> 00:18:02,460
this mission would be doomed to fail.

250
00:18:02,667 --> 00:18:05,185
It's vital that we plug the holes in Wall Maria,

251
00:18:05,438 --> 00:18:06,885
but what matters most here

252
00:18:06,946 --> 00:18:11,755
is that we eliminate Bertholdt and Reiner,
ensuring that they can't breach the wall again.

253
00:18:13,264 --> 00:18:15,386
Okay, so what's the plan?

254
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,055
We'll stab the Armored Titan with those spears?

255
00:18:18,194 --> 00:18:19,501
Think I'll just show you.

256
00:18:20,555 --> 00:18:21,574
Let's go outside.

257
00:18:32,301 --> 00:18:34,168
It's powerful, as you can see.

258
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,877
Not far from a lightning strike.

259
00:18:36,472 --> 00:18:38,706
Hence our calling them "Thunder Spears."

260
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:40,183
They're good weapons,

261
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:42,359
but are they enough to bring down the Armored Titan?

262
00:18:42,514 --> 00:18:44,806
There's no way to be sure until we try.

263
00:18:45,472 --> 00:18:47,639
These can tear a normal Titan apart,

264
00:18:47,722 --> 00:18:50,392
but to do real damage against the Armored Titan,

265
00:18:50,555 --> 00:18:52,457
it'll take some extra work.

266
00:19:14,807 --> 00:19:15,853
Shit!

267
00:19:28,392 --> 00:19:32,277
It doesn't look like biting Eren out of
there is something I can handle by myself.

268
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:35,527
Guess it's on to Plan B.

269
00:19:41,855 --> 00:19:43,733
Go! Now!

270
00:19:44,485 --> 00:19:45,943
They're making a move?

271
00:19:46,597 --> 00:19:48,922
I knew they've been gradually surrounding me, but...

272
00:19:49,264 --> 00:19:51,592
...how exactly do they plan to hurt me?

273
00:19:52,264 --> 00:19:55,684
I've got hardened plate armor
covering every vital point of my body.

274
00:19:56,264 --> 00:19:58,202
Their blades can't even scratch it.

275
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:23,617
Did we do it?

276
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:25,397
This just might work.

277
00:20:25,889 --> 00:20:28,074
The Thunder Spears are so destructive,

278
00:20:28,222 --> 00:20:30,339
they pose a danger to those who fire them.

279
00:20:31,305 --> 00:20:35,364
If you anchor to the Titan itself and
move in as if to slash it with your blade,

280
00:20:35,389 --> 00:20:37,649
you'll end up caught in the resulting explosion.

281
00:20:38,555 --> 00:20:41,343
Which means the only chance to use Thunder Spears

282
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:45,586
is when the target is surrounded
by multiple tall, solid structures.

283
00:20:46,222 --> 00:20:50,646
We can only attack with Thunder
Spears in situations exactly like this.

284
00:20:51,656 --> 00:20:53,045
Right here and now,

285
00:20:53,132 --> 00:20:54,633
we have to end it!

286
00:21:07,389 --> 00:21:08,887
Good! We've got him!

287
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,285
The spears worked!

288
00:21:10,389 --> 00:21:12,517
The armor on his nape is in splinters now!

289
00:21:15,514 --> 00:21:17,381
Whoa, it really worked?

290
00:21:17,847 --> 00:21:19,383
We can actually do some damage!

291
00:21:19,408 --> 00:21:20,495
Do it again!

292
00:21:20,639 --> 00:21:22,305
You each still have a Thunder Spear.

293
00:21:22,389 --> 00:21:23,639
Use them to end this!

294
00:21:28,972 --> 00:21:29,997
But it's Reiner...

295
00:21:31,139 --> 00:21:32,271
Come on, guys!

296
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,750
We said we'd do it if it ever came down to this!

297
00:21:36,555 --> 00:21:37,737
So let's go!

298
00:21:55,842 --> 00:21:58,082
No! I don't wanna die!

299
00:23:41,847 --> 00:23:44,355
If someone had just said the right thing,

300
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,356
could the future have been different?

301
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,596
Lives in the balance,

302
00:23:48,805 --> 00:23:49,953
weighing them down.

303
00:23:50,472 --> 00:23:52,936
None can be saved, except through more death.

304
00:23:53,634 --> 00:23:56,119
Next episode: "Descent."
