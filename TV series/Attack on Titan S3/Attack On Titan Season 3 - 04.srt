1
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:04,825
Don't'cha think they have us spread out a little too much?

2
00:00:05,078 --> 00:00:07,924
We're more likely to find them
if we're not all in the same area.

3
00:00:08,001 --> 00:00:10,846
But why'd I have to get paired up with you of all people?

4
00:00:11,614 --> 00:00:12,864
Spill it, Marlo.

5
00:00:13,072 --> 00:00:15,534
You scheme this up so we'd get some alone time?

6
00:00:15,883 --> 00:00:20,230
Look, Hitch. No offense, but
you weren't my first choice either.

7
00:00:20,325 --> 00:00:23,185
Oh, is that right? Well, good for you then.

8
00:00:23,494 --> 00:00:25,591
Anyway, doesn't this seem odd to you?

9
00:00:25,845 --> 00:00:29,348
Why would the Scouts murder a
civilian and run for the hills?

10
00:00:29,882 --> 00:00:34,505
This is the same group of soldiers who
consistently risk their lives for the sake of humanity.

11
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:38,352
Give me a break. Did you forget?

12
00:00:39,561 --> 00:00:41,610
Think about what they did to Stohess.

13
00:00:41,911 --> 00:00:44,263
The way they turned it into a battlefield.

14
00:00:45,325 --> 00:00:47,838
How many dead bodies do you think we carried?

15
00:00:49,489 --> 00:00:51,357
Annie's been missing ever since.

16
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,998
They still haven't taken her junk out of my room.

17
00:00:56,103 --> 00:00:57,261
It's annoying.

18
00:00:58,078 --> 00:01:03,187
But in doing so, the Scouts also uncovered
a Titan in hiding, and took it prisoner.

19
00:01:03,656 --> 00:01:06,706
I highly doubt that the Military
Police could've done that.

20
00:01:07,329 --> 00:01:10,616
How is disbanding the Scouts what's best for humanity?

21
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:12,903
Be quiet.

22
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:14,762
Listen closely.

23
00:01:19,482 --> 00:01:20,523
Don't move!

24
00:01:23,192 --> 00:01:24,892
Turn around slowly.

25
00:01:28,418 --> 00:01:30,094
You must be a Scout.

26
00:01:32,613 --> 00:01:35,234
Not a sound. Don't say a word.

27
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:38,166
Now listen, and do exactly as I instruct you to...

28
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:41,630
That's the way.

29
00:01:41,841 --> 00:01:44,132
Now hand your guns to the one in front.

30
00:01:50,626 --> 00:01:52,385
Don't say a word, right?

31
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:41,770
Sorry to have kept you waiting, Erwin.

32
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:47,238
I know this is sudden, but
it's time for your interrogation.

33
00:03:50,975 --> 00:03:55,812
So, the Survey Corps murdered a civilian
in cold blood? You're sure about this?

34
00:03:56,645 --> 00:03:58,554
I'm told that the evidence is strong.

35
00:03:58,752 --> 00:04:00,238
But with that said,

36
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:02,263
I can't confirm anything I haven't seen.

37
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:06,637
So then, the Interior Police are
running this case without oversight...

38
00:04:06,662 --> 00:04:08,120
...Hey, you cut that out!

39
00:04:08,826 --> 00:04:10,988
I'm sorry about him, Commander Dawk.

40
00:04:11,044 --> 00:04:13,213
Peaure here is still just a rookie.

41
00:04:13,403 --> 00:04:16,040
He doesn't quite understand how things work yet.

42
00:04:16,731 --> 00:04:20,649
Don't worry, the Interior Police
aren't a subject we plan to write about.

43
00:04:20,871 --> 00:04:23,446
And the same goes for their new ODM gear.

44
00:04:23,915 --> 00:04:25,726
Thanks Roy. See ya.

45
00:04:27,483 --> 00:04:29,683
That new ODM gear worries me.

46
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:34,402
Those guns are useless against Titans,
but they're perfect for human combat.

47
00:04:35,269 --> 00:04:38,469
It's as if that gear were
specifically made for killing Scouts.

48
00:04:39,152 --> 00:04:43,428
Also, judging from the fact that
its existence was hidden from us MPs,

49
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:47,643
I get the impression that we aren't off
the list of people it could be used against.

50
00:04:48,853 --> 00:04:52,031
Anyway. We should get a report from them soon.

51
00:04:52,245 --> 00:04:53,548
Just be patient.

52
00:04:56,751 --> 00:04:58,809
What's the rush, fat-ass?

53
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:05,911
Uh!

54
00:05:06,603 --> 00:05:09,391
Way to go! That's a dead-end, idiot!

55
00:05:11,023 --> 00:05:11,988
Dammit!

56
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:22,332
Shit, he disappeared!

57
00:05:22,357 --> 00:05:24,351
Say what? Check the next alley!

58
00:05:25,126 --> 00:05:26,266
He can't escape!

59
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:34,283
You're the son of Dimo Reeves, right?

60
00:05:34,795 --> 00:05:35,800
What's your name?

61
00:05:37,953 --> 00:05:39,089
I'm Flegel.

62
00:05:39,335 --> 00:05:42,856
Flegel. Nice to meet you. My name's Zoë Hange.

63
00:05:43,046 --> 00:05:46,487
This is sudden, but if the
MPs are trying to hunt you down,

64
00:05:46,653 --> 00:05:49,800
then I'm assuming that you must know
the truth about your father's death.

65
00:05:50,157 --> 00:05:51,882
Could you tell me how it happened?

66
00:05:54,203 --> 00:05:56,337
I made us stop so that I could piss.

67
00:05:56,632 --> 00:05:58,904
That's when the Interior Police found my dad.

68
00:06:00,395 --> 00:06:02,663
There was a tall guy with a black coat and hat.

69
00:06:03,411 --> 00:06:04,833
He slit my dad's throat.

70
00:06:05,738 --> 00:06:08,395
Anyway, I'm glad to see that you survived.

71
00:06:08,542 --> 00:06:10,616
Now we can make the truth known publicly.

72
00:06:10,766 --> 00:06:13,817
You're crazy! Haven't you seen today's newspaper?

73
00:06:14,317 --> 00:06:17,217
If the MPs say you guys did
it, well, then that's the truth.

74
00:06:17,362 --> 00:06:19,125
My testimony means jack shit!

75
00:06:20,241 --> 00:06:21,595
They figured out I was there.

76
00:06:22,126 --> 00:06:24,523
The Interior Police know I saw everything.

77
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:27,193
I'll be hunted for the rest of my life.

78
00:06:28,052 --> 00:06:31,413
And all I can do about it is
run and hide until I'm caught.

79
00:06:31,659 --> 00:06:33,233
My life is over now.

80
00:06:34,162 --> 00:06:34,845
Shit!

81
00:06:36,077 --> 00:06:37,579
Yeah. Maybe.

82
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:41,630
Thing is, that doesn't exactly sound like living to me.

83
00:06:43,617 --> 00:06:45,373
Try looking at it this way.

84
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:50,354
Instead of spending the rest of your life skulking
around like a scared rat till you get murdered,

85
00:06:50,433 --> 00:06:52,157
you could stand up like a human.

86
00:06:52,213 --> 00:06:54,437
And face your enemy even if they might kill you.

87
00:06:54,462 --> 00:06:55,789
Why the hell would I?

88
00:06:56,315 --> 00:06:59,358
Not everyone has the same
disregard for their lives as you!

89
00:06:59,913 --> 00:07:03,103
Know what? Yeah, I am scared,
and I have every right to be.

90
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:04,886
Your family. The company.

91
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:06,994
Don't you think they deserve to know the truth?

92
00:07:07,048 --> 00:07:09,210
Come on! That's just what would be best for you!

93
00:07:09,235 --> 00:07:10,776
Of course it is!

94
00:07:10,982 --> 00:07:13,677
You need to start thinking about what's best for you, too!

95
00:07:13,702 --> 00:07:16,163
Hey! Who's making a racket over my roof?

96
00:07:16,297 --> 00:07:18,474
All right, you're comin' with me, Flegel.

97
00:07:18,712 --> 00:07:21,636
What? You're gang's already lost... just give up!

98
00:07:21,978 --> 00:07:24,512
Why don't you know when you're beat?

99
00:07:24,552 --> 00:07:29,248
That's real simple. Defeat is the only
thing the Scout Regiment has ever known!

100
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:34,783
Get past the checkpoint disguised as MPs.

101
00:07:35,347 --> 00:07:37,946
Then snoop around until we find out where Eren is.

102
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:41,011
It's a shit plan, but it's all we have.

103
00:07:41,616 --> 00:07:42,578
There's no time.

104
00:07:43,802 --> 00:07:46,010
If we don't act now, we're finished.

105
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:47,383
Captain.

106
00:07:47,827 --> 00:07:48,305
Hm?

107
00:07:49,187 --> 00:07:53,453
Now then. You're Stohess District Military Police.

108
00:07:53,549 --> 00:07:55,822
Private Marlo Freudenberg.

109
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:58,984
Captain Levi! It's really him!

110
00:07:59,174 --> 00:08:01,970
Same assignment, Private Hitch Dreyse.

111
00:08:02,172 --> 00:08:04,139
We'll need to dispose of you.

112
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:09,231
Because of what you did, Stohess was a graveyard.

113
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:11,161
Over a hundred people were killed!

114
00:08:11,367 --> 00:08:11,789
Huh?

115
00:08:12,624 --> 00:08:13,277
...Hey!

116
00:08:13,302 --> 00:08:14,203
...You bastards.

117
00:08:14,325 --> 00:08:17,561
I bet you all think you're some kind
of heroes of justice, but you're not.

118
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:21,761
You dropped dozens of innocent families
straight into hell on that mission of yours!

119
00:08:21,872 --> 00:08:23,643
Yeah. We did.

120
00:08:26,082 --> 00:08:29,483
Hey, you. You're from the Southern Cadet Corps, right?

121
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:31,874
So you trained with Annie Leonhart.

122
00:08:32,751 --> 00:08:34,074
Were you a friend of hers?

123
00:08:35,488 --> 00:08:38,650
No. She wouldn't have made friends there, either.

124
00:08:38,904 --> 00:08:41,281
Way too gloomy and unapproachable for that.

125
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:44,547
She was just afraid of people, like a scared little kid.

126
00:08:45,953 --> 00:08:48,813
Now I'll never get the chance to learn anything about her.

127
00:08:49,535 --> 00:08:51,943
She's officially listed as missing... you know why?

128
00:08:52,558 --> 00:08:56,312
It's because one of your Titans turned
her into an ugly red stain on the street!

129
00:08:56,416 --> 00:09:02,270
Actually. No, it's because the Titan
we captured was Annie Leonhart herself.

130
00:09:04,105 --> 00:09:06,767
Goddammit. It makes me sick.

131
00:09:07,235 --> 00:09:09,747
Nobody knows a thing about this world.

132
00:09:09,969 --> 00:09:11,606
Not us or anyone else.

133
00:09:12,267 --> 00:09:14,659
Except for the bastards at the center of it all.

134
00:09:16,136 --> 00:09:19,949
We're letting you go, but we need
to give ourselves a head start on you.

135
00:09:23,157 --> 00:09:23,961
Annie.

136
00:09:24,923 --> 00:09:26,362
Hey! Captain Levi!

137
00:09:26,822 --> 00:09:28,649
Please, let me join in your cause!

138
00:09:29,157 --> 00:09:31,874
I believe that the Military Police are in the wrong here.

139
00:09:32,102 --> 00:09:35,020
If there's any way that I can
fight this world's injustice,

140
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,213
then that's what I want to do!

141
00:09:37,886 --> 00:09:39,635
Easy. Calm down.

142
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:43,386
I swear, I won't let you down, sir!

143
00:09:43,466 --> 00:09:49,066
No. I have no way of telling if you have
enough resolve to make an enemy of the state.

144
00:09:49,257 --> 00:09:53,412
Let's go. Take them deeper into
the woods and tie them up, Sasha.

145
00:09:53,904 --> 00:09:54,626
Sir!

146
00:09:57,941 --> 00:09:58,800
Hey, Captain.

147
00:09:59,997 --> 00:10:01,788
Would you let me do it instead?

148
00:10:06,362 --> 00:10:07,935
Knock yourself out.

149
00:10:15,998 --> 00:10:16,864
All right.

150
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,586
We'll forget everything we saw here.

151
00:10:23,231 --> 00:10:26,949
I know ya will. Because both of you are about to die!

152
00:10:26,981 --> 00:10:28,603
Ah! No! He said to let us go!

153
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,866
The captain might be a big softie, but I'm not.

154
00:10:31,143 --> 00:10:33,312
I'm ready to do what needs to be done.

155
00:10:33,582 --> 00:10:38,445
You have to believe us! We won't betray you...
we know that you're fighting to protect humanity!

156
00:10:38,913 --> 00:10:40,423
Right? Tell him!

157
00:10:40,653 --> 00:10:42,664
As if I'd take your word for it.

158
00:10:42,744 --> 00:10:45,186
I can't trust you... not with that hair.

159
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:48,145
Who in their right mind would get a bowl cut on purpose?

160
00:10:48,403 --> 00:10:51,087
So how can I trust a single word you say?

161
00:10:51,173 --> 00:10:51,809
Uh!

162
00:10:55,581 --> 00:10:57,292
Run, Hitch. I'll cover you!

163
00:11:00,055 --> 00:11:01,811
What do you think'll kill faster?

164
00:11:02,137 --> 00:11:04,190
That knife, or the gun at your chin?

165
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,200
Feel like tryin' your luck? C'mon, let's race!

166
00:11:07,484 --> 00:11:09,714
Please. We're on the same side here!

167
00:11:09,947 --> 00:11:13,086
Why the hell would anyone
believe you wanna join the Scouts?

168
00:11:13,133 --> 00:11:17,908
My comrades are getting rounded up like criminals
as we speak... What makes you think we can win?

169
00:11:19,251 --> 00:11:21,340
Because. You haven't quit.

170
00:11:22,005 --> 00:11:24,645
Despite the odds, the Scouts are still fighting.

171
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:29,412
I made a mistake when I chose my regiment.

172
00:11:30,468 --> 00:11:31,597
But you're a Scout.

173
00:11:31,701 --> 00:11:33,671
You chose to risk your lives for others.

174
00:11:34,829 --> 00:11:36,181
So I'll trust you.

175
00:11:42,353 --> 00:11:43,148
What the...?

176
00:11:44,617 --> 00:11:45,939
Horse-faced jerk!

177
00:11:45,964 --> 00:11:48,504
Stop! He was just trying to test us!

178
00:11:50,673 --> 00:11:51,379
Huh?

179
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:54,392
Are you crazy?

180
00:11:54,884 --> 00:11:59,112
Even with my hands bound, I could've taken a swing
at you with that knife and done some real damage.

181
00:12:00,669 --> 00:12:02,226
How did you know I wouldn't do it?

182
00:12:03,617 --> 00:12:07,184
Don't ask me how, but you remind me of this annoying guy.

183
00:12:07,356 --> 00:12:08,382
An idiot.

184
00:12:10,392 --> 00:12:13,809
Makes me wonder. Is he one of
the fools Annie told me about?

185
00:12:16,191 --> 00:12:17,566
Couldn't say.

186
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:19,393
All of us are fools.

187
00:12:24,438 --> 00:12:26,630
Luckily for me, you're just as dumb.

188
00:12:27,193 --> 00:12:30,356
Marlo, I think you proved your dedication.

189
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:35,028
This should be enough to convince Captain Levi.

190
00:12:35,772 --> 00:12:37,912
We'll be counting on you from here on out.

191
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,645
Far as I know,

192
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:45,237
this is the least-manned checkpoint in the region.

193
00:12:45,618 --> 00:12:47,961
Good. We'll handle things from here.

194
00:12:48,469 --> 00:12:51,059
Get back to your squad before they're suspicious.

195
00:12:51,612 --> 00:12:52,164
Right.

196
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:56,304
Marlo, Hitch.

197
00:12:57,453 --> 00:12:58,419
We're grateful.

198
00:13:00,491 --> 00:13:01,349
Sir!

199
00:13:02,488 --> 00:13:05,519
All right. This time we're picking the fight.

200
00:13:10,145 --> 00:13:10,685
Hm?

201
00:13:30,436 --> 00:13:31,398
Stand down.

202
00:13:34,503 --> 00:13:36,267
Captain. Isn't he...?

203
00:13:36,311 --> 00:13:38,338
He's with the Interior Police.

204
00:13:38,815 --> 00:13:40,581
I've got questions for him.

205
00:13:41,801 --> 00:13:42,845
Let's move.

206
00:14:01,907 --> 00:14:06,395
Thanks, dumbass. There won't be any
witnesses in an abandoned dump like this.

207
00:14:07,903 --> 00:14:08,571
Damn it!

208
00:14:09,534 --> 00:14:12,766
I owe you big time. Thanks a bunch, Flegel.

209
00:14:13,313 --> 00:14:15,570
I mean, when you gave us the slip before...

210
00:14:16,104 --> 00:14:20,361
back in that alley... I really thought I was screwed!

211
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:30,093
My boss would've killed me. I'm serious.

212
00:14:32,145 --> 00:14:34,953
Thanks for comin' back, Flegel. Nice knowin' ya.

213
00:14:34,978 --> 00:14:37,023
No! Wait. Don't shoot yet, please!

214
00:14:37,562 --> 00:14:39,152
Why did my father have to die?

215
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:40,936
Did the Interior Police kill him?

216
00:14:41,139 --> 00:14:43,490
What? I don't see how that matters to you.

217
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,755
After all, you're about to be
a corpse yourself in a moment.

218
00:14:47,192 --> 00:14:49,645
Please! Before I die, I wanna know.

219
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:52,478
What did my father do for you to justify killing him?

220
00:14:52,747 --> 00:14:54,360
Huh? I thought you'd know.

221
00:14:54,701 --> 00:14:58,284
He betrayed us and started helping
out those bastards in the Scout Regiment.

222
00:14:59,713 --> 00:15:02,787
So his orders... they came from the Interior Police?

223
00:15:03,113 --> 00:15:05,170
You guys had him kidnap those Scouts?

224
00:15:05,345 --> 00:15:07,506
Well, it was a different squad, but yeah.

225
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,343
Guess old Dimo didn't say too much about it.

226
00:15:10,669 --> 00:15:13,173
At least not to his dimwit excuse for a son.

227
00:15:14,117 --> 00:15:16,088
And what if he'd refused to do it?

228
00:15:16,765 --> 00:15:18,377
Oh, he knew way too much.

229
00:15:18,487 --> 00:15:23,327
We'd've killed him. I mean, we killed him
anyway, but that's what he gets. The damn idiot.

230
00:15:23,773 --> 00:15:27,173
What made him think the Survey
Corps could help this trash city?

231
00:15:29,022 --> 00:15:30,811
You would never understand.

232
00:15:32,487 --> 00:15:33,242
Hmm?

233
00:15:33,904 --> 00:15:35,958
You think you're real smart shit, don't you?

234
00:15:36,665 --> 00:15:38,993
Wanna know the last thing my dad taught me?

235
00:15:39,477 --> 00:15:41,973
He said a good merchant should trust his nose.

236
00:15:42,997 --> 00:15:44,491
And I'm glad I listened,

237
00:15:45,318 --> 00:15:47,623
because it lead me to the people who could avenge him.

238
00:15:47,964 --> 00:15:49,258
And I side with them!

239
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:51,538
You're gonna die here, piggie!

240
00:15:51,792 --> 00:15:54,122
No need to be brave... go on and squeal!

241
00:15:54,169 --> 00:15:56,449
My business with you is over, asshole!

242
00:15:56,544 --> 00:15:58,359
Why don't'cha take a look above you?

243
00:16:13,191 --> 00:16:14,181
Ow!

244
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:16,261
Section Commander, that was way too reckless!

245
00:16:16,667 --> 00:16:19,401
We pulled it off! Did everyone hear him?

246
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:24,778
No. The Scouts are here? But why?

247
00:16:28,305 --> 00:16:30,236
This "dump" ain't abandoned.

248
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:32,733
Bet it seems unlivable to you.

249
00:16:32,818 --> 00:16:37,881
Yet we're here. The place isn't half as
nice as it used to be, but it's still our home.

250
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:39,677
We heard everything.

251
00:16:39,883 --> 00:16:42,436
About Reiss. And who had him killed.

252
00:16:42,655 --> 00:16:45,095
Every last one of us is a witness.

253
00:16:45,492 --> 00:16:47,770
Yeah? Well, it doesn't matter.

254
00:16:47,994 --> 00:16:50,736
'Cause it's the government that decides what's true!

255
00:16:50,966 --> 00:16:54,953
Idiots! Don't even think for a
second you can get away with this!

256
00:16:55,207 --> 00:16:56,671
You're in for a world of...

257
00:16:57,736 --> 00:17:00,421
Listen. You'll all be fine,

258
00:17:00,889 --> 00:17:02,986
'cause The Reeves Company will protect you.

259
00:17:03,383 --> 00:17:05,528
You trusted my father, Dimo.

260
00:17:06,331 --> 00:17:07,944
Well, now I'm in charge.

261
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:13,831
So, from now on you can count on me.

262
00:17:14,478 --> 00:17:15,801
That's a promise.

263
00:17:20,848 --> 00:17:22,625
Glad to hear it, Mr. Reeves!

264
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:24,686
Speak up next time!

265
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:26,395
Glad to see you stepped up.

266
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,703
Hey. You give 'em hell, Flegel.

267
00:17:29,561 --> 00:17:30,354
Right.

268
00:17:30,724 --> 00:17:31,221
Hm!

269
00:17:35,355 --> 00:17:36,521
Screw you.

270
00:17:41,479 --> 00:17:43,458
Where'd they take Eren and Christa?

271
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:46,603
You bastards. You think you're so brave.

272
00:17:46,842 --> 00:17:48,924
That post was manned by recruits.

273
00:17:48,995 --> 00:17:51,426
They barely even knew how to wipe their own asses.

274
00:17:51,918 --> 00:17:54,970
No one's gonna think you're heroes for beating them down.

275
00:17:56,017 --> 00:17:58,242
Yeah, the guilt's tearing me apart.

276
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:04,273
But what really gets at me is this mouth of yours.

277
00:18:04,797 --> 00:18:08,548
I'm gonna suggest that you start
talking while you're still able to use it.

278
00:18:08,936 --> 00:18:10,677
Now, where are Eren and Christa?

279
00:18:14,268 --> 00:18:18,216
You can't win. All that's left to you now

280
00:18:18,605 --> 00:18:21,103
is to find some filthy corner to hide in!

281
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:23,020
Covered in mud and shit!

282
00:18:23,183 --> 00:18:24,811
If you don't turn yourselves in,

283
00:18:24,985 --> 00:18:27,759
then every last Scout we captured will get the noose!

284
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:31,946
Starting with the guiltiest one of all, Erwin Smith!

285
00:18:35,811 --> 00:18:39,493
Hurts, right? That's what you
get for not answering my question.

286
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:42,942
Some Scout's lives are more valuable than others.

287
00:18:43,498 --> 00:18:46,097
Only those dumb enough to agree to that join us.

288
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:49,940
Again, where'd they take Eren and Christa?

289
00:18:50,155 --> 00:18:53,770
I-I don't know. Nobody told me, I swear!

290
00:18:53,953 --> 00:18:56,770
Kenny Ackermann doesn't like to make his business known!

291
00:18:57,049 --> 00:18:58,154
Ackermann?

292
00:18:59,226 --> 00:19:01,927
I know Kenny. That his last name?

293
00:19:02,112 --> 00:19:03,121
It is, but...

294
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,020
He never was much of one for sharing information.

295
00:19:08,239 --> 00:19:09,994
Not important stuff, anyway.

296
00:19:10,812 --> 00:19:12,974
But I bet you have a rough idea.

297
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:14,769
You'd best try to remember.

298
00:19:14,892 --> 00:19:15,874
No. Stop!

299
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:18,734
You still have plenty of bones left for me to break.

300
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,277
Damn it. Are you insane?

301
00:19:23,326 --> 00:19:24,184
Maybe.

302
00:19:25,028 --> 00:19:26,503
Somebody's coming towards us!

303
00:19:29,134 --> 00:19:30,293
And there's more than one.

304
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:36,189
Told you. You're beat. Struggle all you want.

305
00:19:37,331 --> 00:19:40,836
One way or another, the Survey Corps will be destroyed.

306
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,188
You've seen better days.

307
00:19:52,397 --> 00:19:55,605
Kinda funny. You were lecturing me just the other day.

308
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:02,251
Soon, you'll be sent before the king.

309
00:20:02,525 --> 00:20:06,681
Then, his council will determine your
sentence, and what to do with the Survey Corps.

310
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,659
So you came.

311
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,100
Tell me Nile, where do you live?

312
00:20:13,793 --> 00:20:15,141
Stohess, was it?

313
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,336
How's Marie?

314
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:20,466
How are your children?

315
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:22,650
I trust they're all in good health.

316
00:20:25,213 --> 00:20:28,911
Marie and the kids are... They should be just fine.

317
00:20:29,189 --> 00:20:34,536
I haven't been home in a while, but
it's in Wall Rose on the east side.

318
00:20:36,389 --> 00:20:37,260
I see.

319
00:20:39,342 --> 00:20:41,727
Why ask that? What's going on?

320
00:20:43,253 --> 00:20:45,914
I entrusted something to Commander Pyxis.

321
00:20:47,178 --> 00:20:49,378
Whenever that crucial moment comes,

322
00:20:51,642 --> 00:20:53,994
what happens next is out of my hands.

323
00:20:54,835 --> 00:20:58,609
It'll be your choice to make. Yours and theirs.

324
00:21:04,648 --> 00:21:08,159
So, what did we learn from the interrogation?

325
00:21:08,603 --> 00:21:13,362
Not much. Erwin didn't even realize that
Pastor Nick was with the Order of the Walls,

326
00:21:13,387 --> 00:21:17,256
so Historia can make all the claims
about her name she wants and it won't matter.

327
00:21:17,383 --> 00:21:19,004
They'll all amount to nothing.

328
00:21:19,219 --> 00:21:20,491
What a farce.

329
00:21:20,561 --> 00:21:26,345
They don't know it, but in truth they're nothing
more than cattle in a pen; simply waiting to die.

330
00:21:27,259 --> 00:21:27,807
Hm?

331
00:21:28,586 --> 00:21:32,027
My apologies. But Erwin Smith has arrived.

332
00:21:32,703 --> 00:21:34,625
Very well. We'll be along.

333
00:21:35,952 --> 00:21:40,503
Once Erwin has been executed,
all will be according to plan.

334
00:21:41,203 --> 00:21:44,851
The secrets of the walls will be kept as safe as ever.

335
00:21:45,255 --> 00:21:48,013
And the king's peace will be ensured.

336
00:21:49,468 --> 00:21:50,261
Forever.

337
00:21:59,141 --> 00:22:03,233
Erwin Smith. Do you have any last words?

338
00:23:40,547 --> 00:23:42,563
In order to protect the kingdom,

339
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:47,055
they kept the truth of the
walls... and the world... hidden.

340
00:23:47,857 --> 00:23:52,111
But in doing so, they invited an uprising of the people.

341
00:23:52,772 --> 00:23:54,855
