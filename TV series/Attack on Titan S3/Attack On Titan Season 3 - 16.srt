1
00:00:22,116 --> 00:00:23,023
Oh, no.

2
00:00:26,489 --> 00:00:28,720
Look at all those houses up in the sky.

3
00:00:29,891 --> 00:00:32,637
One of 'em could be yours, right, Eren?

4
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:35,187
How's it feel to have your own roof over your head again?

5
00:00:35,447 --> 00:00:37,688
Get it?

6
00:00:39,364 --> 00:00:41,989
Sasha, could you smack him for me?

7
00:00:43,614 --> 00:00:45,967
It doesn't look like Bertholdt knows our location.

8
00:00:46,364 --> 00:00:47,248
You're right.

9
00:00:47,531 --> 00:00:51,910
He's just scattering burning debris to
turn Shiganshina into a sea of flames.

10
00:00:53,817 --> 00:00:55,525
That bastard.

11
00:00:55,589 --> 00:00:57,041
You're back.

12
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:00,219
And this time you wanna burn down my city?

13
00:01:02,072 --> 00:01:03,270
Hey, Armin!

14
00:01:03,572 --> 00:01:05,161
Your orders? C'mon!

15
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:06,383
What should we do?

16
00:01:08,215 --> 00:01:09,696
I can tell I'm right.

17
00:01:09,864 --> 00:01:11,762
I mean, just look at the way you're shaking.

18
00:01:11,845 --> 00:01:14,074
You're scared outta your mind, aren't you?

19
00:01:17,023 --> 00:01:19,858
Jean, can you take over for me?

20
00:01:20,531 --> 00:01:21,116
What?

21
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:23,330
I don't know what to do.

22
00:01:23,566 --> 00:01:24,975
I'm worried I'll screw up.

23
00:01:25,614 --> 00:01:29,162
I made a mistake thinking we could talk
to Bertholdt, and look where it got us.

24
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:30,410
Please, Jean!

25
00:01:30,483 --> 00:01:32,483
You're better suited for this!

26
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:36,935
Move.

27
00:01:37,406 --> 00:01:38,421
Make for the river!

28
00:01:39,106 --> 00:01:40,439
Everyone aboard Eren!

29
00:01:40,531 --> 00:01:41,916
Conserve our gas!

30
00:01:47,178 --> 00:01:47,750
Eren.

31
00:01:48,084 --> 00:01:50,338
At some point, we'll have to get Bertholdt's attention,

32
00:01:50,744 --> 00:01:53,366
but until then, you need to stay out of sight.

33
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:55,122
Hey, Armin.

34
00:01:57,697 --> 00:01:59,475
I'm all right with judgment calls,

35
00:01:59,614 --> 00:02:02,470
but I don't have some genius
plan for getting us out of this.

36
00:02:03,364 --> 00:02:05,617
In the end, you're the one we're gonna be counting on.

37
00:03:51,614 --> 00:03:53,158
This area's all mopped up.

38
00:03:53,281 --> 00:03:55,955
The only ones left for us to
eliminate are way up at the front.

39
00:03:56,947 --> 00:04:00,174
But I still don't see how we're
going to take down the Beast Titan.

40
00:04:01,031 --> 00:04:04,369
It doesn't seem like he's got any
intention of budging from that spot.

41
00:04:05,156 --> 00:04:06,077
That's true.

42
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,016
Looks like the big guy's a coward.

43
00:04:08,697 --> 00:04:10,980
Not that he ever had any balls to begin with.

44
00:04:11,697 --> 00:04:12,791
Save your energy.

45
00:04:13,214 --> 00:04:15,620
We can finish off the rest of the runts out there.

46
00:04:16,024 --> 00:04:16,853
Let's go!

47
00:04:17,031 --> 00:04:17,821
Yes, sir!

48
00:04:20,947 --> 00:04:21,754
Shit.

49
00:04:22,244 --> 00:04:23,748
That explosion just now...

50
00:04:24,322 --> 00:04:25,900
Are Hange and the others all right?

51
00:04:26,531 --> 00:04:27,774
Or did they get caught up in it?

52
00:04:29,281 --> 00:04:31,087
I need to get to the other side and...

53
00:05:00,539 --> 00:05:01,961
Hmm.

54
00:05:02,223 --> 00:05:05,144
That one was a little higher than I would've liked.

55
00:05:05,364 --> 00:05:07,686
Huh? Oh, good work.

56
00:05:07,752 --> 00:05:08,733
Leave it there.

57
00:05:12,614 --> 00:05:16,304
No problem, we'll just consider the first pitch a warm-up.

58
00:05:16,447 --> 00:05:20,078
I'm going for nothing less than a perfect game today!

59
00:05:21,413 --> 00:05:22,946
Frontal bombardment!

60
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:25,162
All troops, take cover now!

61
00:05:26,228 --> 00:05:26,847
What the...?

62
00:05:26,902 --> 00:05:27,777
Damn it!

63
00:05:27,906 --> 00:05:29,793
Get down!

64
00:05:56,781 --> 00:05:59,447
Guys, any idea what the hell that sound was?

65
00:05:59,554 --> 00:06:01,636
So does the enemy have cannons or something?

66
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:03,433
If so, there's gotta be a hundred of them!

67
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,991
Calm down, everyone! You're scaring the horses!

68
00:06:06,058 --> 00:06:07,721
The Titan's throwing boulders!

69
00:06:08,559 --> 00:06:09,627
Captain Levi!

70
00:06:10,189 --> 00:06:11,115
Move, now!

71
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,069
Take the horses and retreat to the wall.

72
00:06:13,845 --> 00:06:14,611
Yes, sir!

73
00:06:16,741 --> 00:06:19,267
Move! Stay out of the line of fire!

74
00:06:25,495 --> 00:06:27,489
You wanna die? Get up!

75
00:06:29,444 --> 00:06:30,253
Commander!

76
00:06:31,415 --> 00:06:32,535
How's it looking?

77
00:06:33,012 --> 00:06:33,741
Terrible.

78
00:06:34,489 --> 00:06:36,239
The front line of houses is gone.

79
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:37,459
He decimated them.

80
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:41,512
If he keeps throwing those, everything will be leveled.

81
00:06:41,869 --> 00:06:44,063
We won't have anything left to hide behind.

82
00:06:44,706 --> 00:06:47,233
And we can't retreat to the other side of the wall?

83
00:06:47,683 --> 00:06:48,354
No.

84
00:06:48,646 --> 00:06:51,094
The Colossal Titan is already heading this way,

85
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:53,793
setting fire to everything in his path.

86
00:06:56,027 --> 00:06:59,126
Theoretically, we could scale
the wall to evade the stones,

87
00:06:59,239 --> 00:07:00,541
but the horses can't.

88
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:04,625
We retreat here, and there's no hope for victory.

89
00:07:05,114 --> 00:07:06,904
What happened to Hange's group?

90
00:07:07,156 --> 00:07:08,311
Is Eren all right?

91
00:07:09,423 --> 00:07:10,385
I don't know.

92
00:07:10,864 --> 00:07:11,964
Most of them are gone...

93
00:07:12,048 --> 00:07:13,928
caught up when the explosion occurred.

94
00:07:14,632 --> 00:07:16,812
We've sustained a great many casualties.

95
00:07:18,197 --> 00:07:23,152
The Beast Titan directed the small Titans in such
a way that our soldiers would group up in one place.

96
00:07:24,197 --> 00:07:28,089
Dirk Squad, Marlene Squad, and Klaus
Squad were engaging the small Titans,

97
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,874
which put them in the line of fire
when he launched the bombardment.

98
00:07:31,281 --> 00:07:32,693
They were all wiped out.

99
00:07:34,132 --> 00:07:35,180
In other words,

100
00:07:35,447 --> 00:07:37,738
our remaining forces on this side of the gate

101
00:07:37,989 --> 00:07:42,544
consist of you new Scout recruits, Captain Levi, and me.

102
00:07:43,711 --> 00:07:44,737
No others.

103
00:07:50,114 --> 00:07:51,594
We're doomed!

104
00:07:51,798 --> 00:07:52,912
So what now?

105
00:07:53,281 --> 00:07:54,922
Do you have any kind of plan?

106
00:07:58,864 --> 00:07:59,865
Yell at him, Eren!

107
00:07:59,984 --> 00:08:02,859
We can't let Bertholdt get any closer to the wall!

108
00:08:11,822 --> 00:08:12,693
He heard you.

109
00:08:16,697 --> 00:08:19,702
The bastard's ignoring us. He's
heading straight for the wall!

110
00:08:20,156 --> 00:08:21,887
So what do we do now, Jean?

111
00:08:21,954 --> 00:08:22,921
If he gets there...

112
00:08:22,968 --> 00:08:24,041
We're not letting him.

113
00:08:24,474 --> 00:08:27,258
Hey, Eren! Tackle that lanky jerk's leg!

114
00:08:30,781 --> 00:08:31,661
Hang on.

115
00:08:31,983 --> 00:08:33,806
Do we actually have a plan for this?

116
00:08:33,954 --> 00:08:37,174
With that steam he puts out,
he can make our ODM gear useless!

117
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,984
It won't connect!

118
00:08:39,847 --> 00:08:41,297
You think I don't know that?

119
00:08:42,064 --> 00:08:44,991
I'm well aware, but we have to give it a try anyway.

120
00:08:45,198 --> 00:08:47,509
We can figure out his weakness as we fight!

121
00:08:47,656 --> 00:08:48,764
I can kill him.

122
00:08:48,864 --> 00:08:50,552
You just keep him distracted.

123
00:08:50,665 --> 00:08:52,546
Conny, give me your Thunder Spear.

124
00:08:52,706 --> 00:08:54,619
Uh... sure thing!

125
00:08:54,765 --> 00:08:57,893
Listen, Armin. Odds are, we're
still gonna need a plan from you.

126
00:08:57,965 --> 00:09:00,324
So stop moping and observe him from afar.

127
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:02,531
We have to believe we can win this!

128
00:09:03,031 --> 00:09:03,787
Right!

129
00:09:06,239 --> 00:09:07,864
Now! Scatter!

130
00:09:10,447 --> 00:09:13,251
How dare you look down on me!

131
00:09:13,366 --> 00:09:14,801
After what you've done,

132
00:09:14,906 --> 00:09:18,343
you should be on your knees begging for mercy!

133
00:09:34,822 --> 00:09:36,346
Whoa. He pushed him!

134
00:09:36,523 --> 00:09:37,939
You can do it, Eren!

135
00:09:38,031 --> 00:09:39,491
Knock him on his ass!

136
00:09:39,756 --> 00:09:41,214
There must be a way.

137
00:09:41,282 --> 00:09:42,773
We just have to find it.

138
00:09:46,408 --> 00:09:47,459
Huh?

139
00:09:57,447 --> 00:09:58,979
Eren!

140
00:10:03,238 --> 00:10:03,897
Damn it.

141
00:10:04,489 --> 00:10:05,780
That's Eren up there.

142
00:10:06,615 --> 00:10:08,879
There's only one Titan that could fling him like that.

143
00:10:09,906 --> 00:10:10,905
The Colossal.

144
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:16,037
Eren's not moving.

145
00:10:16,085 --> 00:10:17,285
He's still alive, though.

146
00:10:17,614 --> 00:10:19,557
Focus on keeping Bertholdt off him.

147
00:10:20,364 --> 00:10:22,458
That might have been pushing it too far.

148
00:10:23,031 --> 00:10:25,754
That's what'll happen if we charge at him without a plan.

149
00:10:26,864 --> 00:10:27,836
Now what?

150
00:10:28,156 --> 00:10:30,346
Unless we can turn the tables somehow,

151
00:10:30,739 --> 00:10:32,578
this operation will fail,

152
00:10:32,822 --> 00:10:34,048
all of us will die,

153
00:10:34,156 --> 00:10:36,750
and eventually, humanity will fall.

154
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:38,991
Well, screw it then.

155
00:10:39,114 --> 00:10:42,447
Plan or no, I'm not just gonna sit
around and wait to get slaughtered.

156
00:10:42,554 --> 00:10:44,005
Let's take the fight to him!

157
00:10:48,615 --> 00:10:50,639
He doesn't know about the Thunder Spears yet!

158
00:10:50,755 --> 00:10:53,151
Sasha and Conny will help me distract him!

159
00:10:53,866 --> 00:10:55,588
Mikasa, you go for the kill!

160
00:10:55,824 --> 00:10:56,541
Right!

161
00:10:58,364 --> 00:10:59,521
Hey, freak-show!

162
00:10:59,614 --> 00:11:01,260
You forget your skin somewhere?

163
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:03,193
You look so gross!

164
00:11:03,225 --> 00:11:05,808
No one wants to see all that, ya pervert!

165
00:11:06,506 --> 00:11:08,716
This distraction is way too obvious.

166
00:11:09,047 --> 00:11:11,703
But we only need one good hit.

167
00:11:32,781 --> 00:11:33,740
Guys!

168
00:11:34,832 --> 00:11:36,341
Is there nothing we can do?

169
00:11:36,428 --> 00:11:39,335
That steam even knocked away
the Thunder Spears mid-flight.

170
00:11:41,544 --> 00:11:42,298
Conny!

171
00:11:42,377 --> 00:11:45,079
Damn it. I breathed some in and burned my throat.

172
00:11:46,533 --> 00:11:48,416
Mikasa! You're hurt!

173
00:11:48,489 --> 00:11:49,328
It isn't bad.

174
00:11:49,938 --> 00:11:52,236
A bit of shrapnel from the Thunder Spears got me.

175
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:53,872
Figured something out yet?

176
00:11:54,986 --> 00:11:55,613
Huh?

177
00:11:55,959 --> 00:11:58,632
Tell me. Is there a way that we can fight back?

178
00:12:02,752 --> 00:12:03,613
I don't know.

179
00:12:39,906 --> 00:12:42,538
This place is gonna look like a honeycomb before long.

180
00:12:42,707 --> 00:12:44,436
The Beast Titan knows where we are.

181
00:12:45,864 --> 00:12:46,565
Erwin.

182
00:12:47,531 --> 00:12:50,457
If there's no chance that we
can turn this around then tell me,

183
00:12:50,822 --> 00:12:52,506
and we can still cut our losses.

184
00:12:52,906 --> 00:12:55,319
Go shake the shit out of Eren till he wakes up.

185
00:12:55,739 --> 00:12:58,402
Have him run away with as many people as he can carry.

186
00:12:58,989 --> 00:13:00,864
Then we'll have at least some survivors.

187
00:13:02,906 --> 00:13:04,893
It's our job to guard the horses!

188
00:13:05,212 --> 00:13:06,837
Why'd you let yours run away?

189
00:13:06,906 --> 00:13:07,841
Shut up!

190
00:13:07,947 --> 00:13:09,437
Like it even matters now.

191
00:13:09,462 --> 00:13:10,273
What was that?

192
00:13:11,171 --> 00:13:14,746
Those other scouts were insanely
strong and all of them died in an instant!

193
00:13:15,286 --> 00:13:17,565
What chance do we have where they failed?

194
00:13:17,864 --> 00:13:19,926
There's no reason to guard the horses.

195
00:13:20,649 --> 00:13:23,557
Because there's not gonna be
anyone left to ride them home!

196
00:13:28,947 --> 00:13:30,922
There was a point when it all made sense.

197
00:13:31,656 --> 00:13:34,298
If everyone just cowered behind the walls and waited,

198
00:13:34,389 --> 00:13:37,317
then someday Titans would come
out of nowhere and wipe us out.

199
00:13:38,322 --> 00:13:41,146
It was obvious that someone
needed to bite the bullet and fight.

200
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:43,323
It would be dangerous, yeah,

201
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:47,479
but the soldiers who did it would be
risking their lives to protect their loved ones.

202
00:13:48,492 --> 00:13:50,403
So when the recruiter asked us,

203
00:13:51,394 --> 00:13:53,352
"Which of you has the courage?"

204
00:13:53,532 --> 00:13:55,304
I actually thought I could do it.

205
00:13:56,114 --> 00:13:57,792
Thought I'd be some kinda hero.

206
00:13:58,607 --> 00:13:59,563
I didn't get it.

207
00:13:59,857 --> 00:14:00,986
I didn't know.

208
00:14:01,463 --> 00:14:02,963
I thought that if I died,

209
00:14:02,988 --> 00:14:06,030
it would at least have some meaning... but it won't.

210
00:14:06,756 --> 00:14:08,787
It didn't for the others. They're just gone.

211
00:14:09,964 --> 00:14:10,710
You know what?

212
00:14:11,411 --> 00:14:14,818
I bet almost everyone ends up
having that same final thought.

213
00:14:15,954 --> 00:14:18,083
I was so stupid for coming here.

214
00:14:18,683 --> 00:14:20,570
Why did I think I'd be different?

215
00:14:26,512 --> 00:14:30,285
You could tell what's left of the recruits
and Hange's group to run away on horseback.

216
00:14:30,456 --> 00:14:34,128
They won't have much of a chance, but they'll be decoys.

217
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:36,506
They can give Eren a shot at escaping.

218
00:14:37,447 --> 00:14:38,167
Tell me.

219
00:14:38,491 --> 00:14:40,153
How would you fit into this plan?

220
00:14:40,712 --> 00:14:42,377
I'm gonna go after the Beast Titan.

221
00:14:42,797 --> 00:14:44,339
I'll draw him away somehow and...

222
00:14:44,404 --> 00:14:45,198
You can't.

223
00:14:45,755 --> 00:14:47,225
You won't even make it near him.

224
00:14:48,204 --> 00:14:49,299
Probably not.

225
00:14:50,031 --> 00:14:52,976
But, if you and Eren make it home alive,

226
00:14:53,072 --> 00:14:54,454
then there will still be hope.

227
00:14:54,947 --> 00:14:56,189
All things considered,

228
00:14:56,214 --> 00:14:58,141
I feel like that's the best we can ask for.

229
00:14:59,364 --> 00:15:00,706
We've been brutalized.

230
00:15:01,812 --> 00:15:02,900
To be honest, sir,

231
00:15:03,406 --> 00:15:07,094
it seems like this battle will be where
the Scout Regiment gets finished off.

232
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:08,707
Yes.

233
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,727
If we had no way to fight back, then you would be right.

234
00:15:15,962 --> 00:15:16,842
Is there a way?

235
00:15:17,562 --> 00:15:18,360
There is.

236
00:15:19,531 --> 00:15:21,276
You could've mentioned that before.

237
00:15:21,822 --> 00:15:24,644
Care to explain why you kept your shitty mouth shut?

238
00:15:25,255 --> 00:15:26,845
The plan could go a few ways.

239
00:15:27,239 --> 00:15:30,444
Best case, you'll have a decent
chance of killing the Beast Titan.

240
00:15:31,185 --> 00:15:34,918
But for it to succeed... the recruits and I have to die.

241
00:15:40,364 --> 00:15:41,877
The Survey Corps may survive.

242
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:45,301
But regardless, most of us will end up dead.

243
00:15:46,986 --> 00:15:50,521
Frankly, we're almost guaranteed
to be defeated, no matter what.

244
00:15:51,687 --> 00:15:55,549
The recruits and I will be staking our
deaths on the slimmest chance of victory.

245
00:15:58,966 --> 00:15:59,841
For this to work...

246
00:16:00,294 --> 00:16:02,962
to convince these youths to charge toward their deaths...

247
00:16:03,281 --> 00:16:06,696
it would take an expert con man
and a whole slew of blatant lies.

248
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,009
If I don't lead the vanguard myself,

249
00:16:10,322 --> 00:16:11,852
then none of them will have the courage.

250
00:16:12,447 --> 00:16:14,466
Which means I must be the first to charge.

251
00:16:15,542 --> 00:16:17,375
And the first to be slain as well.

252
00:16:18,114 --> 00:16:19,639
So I'll never learn the truth.

253
00:16:20,974 --> 00:16:21,562
Huh?

254
00:16:29,504 --> 00:16:32,946
I just... wanted to reach that cellar.

255
00:16:34,504 --> 00:16:36,276
Everything I've done up to this point,

256
00:16:37,088 --> 00:16:39,232
I did in the hopes that this chance would come.

257
00:16:40,864 --> 00:16:44,182
I dreamt... that I'd get to prove I was right.

258
00:16:46,364 --> 00:16:47,272
Many times,

259
00:16:47,906 --> 00:16:51,442
I thought that death would've been easier, but then I...

260
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:55,234
I think of the questions I needed answered.

261
00:16:56,197 --> 00:16:57,315
They're what I lived for.

262
00:16:58,031 --> 00:17:00,810
And now those answers are no
more than a coward's leap away.

263
00:17:04,411 --> 00:17:06,243
I'm so close, but...

264
00:17:09,322 --> 00:17:10,511
Can you see them, too?

265
00:17:12,864 --> 00:17:15,659
Our comrades. They're all standing around us.

266
00:17:19,697 --> 00:17:21,570
They've been watching us all this time.

267
00:17:22,389 --> 00:17:25,568
They want to know what we did
with the sacrifices that they made...

268
00:17:26,466 --> 00:17:28,419
What became of the hearts they gave...

269
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:38,707
But that's probably just in my head, right?

270
00:17:39,173 --> 00:17:41,727
Of no more import than a child's bad dream.

271
00:17:48,197 --> 00:17:49,362
You led us well.

272
00:17:50,072 --> 00:17:50,903
Fought hard.

273
00:17:51,656 --> 00:17:53,635
No one else could've gotten us this far.

274
00:17:56,197 --> 00:17:57,672
I'll make the choice for you.

275
00:18:00,031 --> 00:18:02,453
Give up on your dream and charge to your death.

276
00:18:02,866 --> 00:18:05,251
Lead those crying children straight to hell.

277
00:18:06,156 --> 00:18:09,080
I'll reach the Beast Titan and tear him apart.

278
00:18:26,156 --> 00:18:27,019
Huh?

279
00:18:31,489 --> 00:18:33,844
Charge!

280
00:18:38,072 --> 00:18:38,850
Huh.

281
00:18:39,227 --> 00:18:42,202
I didn't expect them to lay down and die, but...

282
00:18:43,031 --> 00:18:44,760
A suicide charge?

283
00:18:45,406 --> 00:18:48,502
For some reason I thought they'd do better than that.

284
00:18:49,167 --> 00:18:51,910
All right. Fire!

285
00:18:55,697 --> 00:18:57,264
Is that smoke?

286
00:18:57,664 --> 00:19:01,031
Oh, it's from those signal guns they use.

287
00:19:01,697 --> 00:19:03,702
Incoming. Spread out!

288
00:19:07,739 --> 00:19:09,755
I'm about to announce our final mission.

289
00:19:10,489 --> 00:19:11,876
All troops, line up!

290
00:19:14,406 --> 00:19:16,478
We're going to mount a cavalry charge,

291
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,439
rushing the Beast Titan directly.

292
00:19:19,614 --> 00:19:22,880
Clearly, this will make us ideal targets for him.

293
00:19:23,281 --> 00:19:25,653
So we'll wait until the moment he's ready to throw,

294
00:19:25,947 --> 00:19:28,195
and then we'll fire our smoke signals together.

295
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:30,515
That should somewhat reduce his accuracy.

296
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,629
While we distract the Beast Titan,

297
00:19:33,789 --> 00:19:36,671
Captain Levi will get in position to dispatch it.

298
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,857
Does anyone have questions?

299
00:19:39,964 --> 00:19:40,628
What?

300
00:19:41,239 --> 00:19:43,695
You want me to go after him with just ODM gear?

301
00:19:44,406 --> 00:19:46,387
He's standing in the middle of a field.

302
00:19:46,614 --> 00:19:49,017
I can't fight without a house or tree to hook on.

303
00:19:49,739 --> 00:19:50,480
You're wrong.

304
00:19:51,072 --> 00:19:51,672
Huh?

305
00:19:52,339 --> 00:19:55,906
There happens to be a line of objects at
just the right height for your approach.

306
00:19:57,794 --> 00:20:00,150
Use his thralls to advance unseen...

307
00:20:00,937 --> 00:20:02,907
...and assassinate the son of a bitch.

308
00:20:10,411 --> 00:20:11,477
I'm sorry.

309
00:20:19,379 --> 00:20:21,035
There's no point standing around.

310
00:20:21,116 --> 00:20:23,188
We'll only be showered by more boulders.

311
00:20:23,754 --> 00:20:25,429
Ready your horses, on the double!

312
00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:27,550
Be honest.

313
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:31,562
Are all of us... riding to our deaths?

314
00:20:32,572 --> 00:20:33,501
Yes, we are.

315
00:20:34,447 --> 00:20:37,227
And since we're dying anyway,
you're saying that it's better...

316
00:20:38,881 --> 00:20:40,467
...if we at least die fighting?

317
00:20:41,239 --> 00:20:41,946
I am.

318
00:20:42,847 --> 00:20:47,310
But wait, if we'll die anyway, then who cares what we do?

319
00:20:47,694 --> 00:20:49,495
We could just disobey your orders...

320
00:20:50,071 --> 00:20:51,688
...and it wouldn't mean a thing, would it?

321
00:20:52,197 --> 00:20:53,659
Yes, you're precisely right.

322
00:20:55,156 --> 00:20:56,940
Everything that you thought had meaning...

323
00:20:57,187 --> 00:20:59,475
every hope, dream, or moment of happiness...

324
00:21:00,712 --> 00:21:03,724
None of it matters as you lie,
bleeding out, on the battlefield.

325
00:21:04,782 --> 00:21:07,713
None of it changes what a speeding rock does to a body.

326
00:21:07,989 --> 00:21:08,873
We all die.

327
00:21:11,216 --> 00:21:13,354
But does that mean our lives are meaningless?

328
00:21:14,185 --> 00:21:16,850
Does that mean that there was no point in our being born?

329
00:21:18,891 --> 00:21:21,075
Would you say that of our slain comrades?

330
00:21:21,698 --> 00:21:23,038
What about their lives?

331
00:21:23,797 --> 00:21:25,207
Were they meaningless?

332
00:21:27,114 --> 00:21:28,171
They were not!

333
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:31,269
Their memory serves as an example to us all!

334
00:21:32,174 --> 00:21:33,612
The courageous fallen!

335
00:21:33,864 --> 00:21:35,178
The anguished fallen!

336
00:21:35,399 --> 00:21:39,421
Their lives have meaning because
we, the living, refuse to forget them!

337
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:41,701
And as we ride to certain death,

338
00:21:41,757 --> 00:21:44,608
we trust our successors to do the same for us.

339
00:21:45,257 --> 00:21:50,059
Because my soldiers do not buckle or yield
when faced with the cruelty of this world.

340
00:21:51,275 --> 00:21:53,364
My soldiers push forward!

341
00:21:53,447 --> 00:21:55,342
My soldiers scream out!

342
00:21:55,797 --> 00:21:58,703
My soldiers rage!

343
00:23:41,697 --> 00:23:43,555
For friends who gave their hearts.

344
00:23:43,873 --> 00:23:46,095
For friends who gave up on their dreams.

345
00:23:46,864 --> 00:23:48,650
Until everything burns out,

346
00:23:48,739 --> 00:23:50,507
they'll charge through the chaos

347
00:23:50,864 --> 00:23:53,246
to spite the fear they've been taught.

348
00:23:53,656 --> 00:23:56,166
Next episode: "Hero."
