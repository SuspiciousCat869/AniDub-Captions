1
00:01:42,566 --> 00:01:44,313
We need to take cover!

2
00:01:55,191 --> 00:01:56,179
It hurts.

3
00:01:56,863 --> 00:01:59,072
It hurts so badly.

4
00:02:29,453 --> 00:02:30,375
Bertholdt...

5
00:02:33,566 --> 00:02:34,705
It hurts...

6
00:02:36,848 --> 00:02:38,509
It hurts so badly.

7
00:02:39,566 --> 00:02:40,789
Wait, are you...?

8
00:02:41,281 --> 00:02:42,680
Whoa. Sasha!

9
00:02:43,505 --> 00:02:44,799
You're in horrible shape.

10
00:02:45,117 --> 00:02:46,363
What happened to you?

11
00:02:47,691 --> 00:02:48,579
You're up!

12
00:02:50,456 --> 00:02:51,362
Eren.

13
00:02:58,868 --> 00:03:01,168
Armin. I'm so glad you're back.

14
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:08,904
'Bout time.

15
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:11,377
Captain!

16
00:03:12,582 --> 00:03:13,569
What happened?

17
00:03:13,941 --> 00:03:15,547
I saw Bertholdt transform,

18
00:03:16,389 --> 00:03:19,274
but then everything gets kind of blurry.

19
00:03:20,403 --> 00:03:21,721
Did we fight them off?

20
00:03:21,998 --> 00:03:23,173
Is everyone okay?

21
00:03:24,233 --> 00:03:27,283
It sounds like your recent
memory was just about wiped out.

22
00:03:27,593 --> 00:03:28,021
Huh?

23
00:03:28,863 --> 00:03:30,946
Eren. Tell him everything.

24
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:55,503
Okay. Are you up to speed now?

25
00:03:56,127 --> 00:03:56,614
Yeah.

26
00:03:59,542 --> 00:04:00,388
We won.

27
00:04:01,233 --> 00:04:02,730
But of the Scout Regiment,

28
00:04:03,249 --> 00:04:05,424
there are only nine soldiers left alive.

29
00:04:05,707 --> 00:04:06,780
The nine of us.

30
00:04:07,207 --> 00:04:08,473
That's what it looks like.

31
00:04:08,964 --> 00:04:11,014
The fighting ended four hours ago.

32
00:04:11,595 --> 00:04:14,906
We've been searching for survivors, but... no luck.

33
00:04:17,164 --> 00:04:22,159
So, to be clear, we resealed
Shiganshina's gate, securing Wall Maria.

34
00:04:22,563 --> 00:04:24,566
Reiner and the Beast Titan escaped,

35
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,265
along with that quadruped.

36
00:04:27,123 --> 00:04:28,927
You managed to capture Bertholdt.

37
00:04:29,842 --> 00:04:32,916
And then, with both the commander and me wounded,

38
00:04:33,566 --> 00:04:36,267
you had to choose which of us to give the injection to.

39
00:04:37,566 --> 00:04:38,396
And you did.

40
00:04:39,214 --> 00:04:41,876
I transformed into a Titan and killed Bertholdt.

41
00:04:42,121 --> 00:04:43,670
I ate him.

42
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:50,187
Here.

43
00:05:05,733 --> 00:05:06,512
Why though?

44
00:05:06,983 --> 00:05:08,339
Why'd you pick me?

45
00:05:10,223 --> 00:05:12,050
No matter how you look at it,

46
00:05:12,374 --> 00:05:15,165
Commander Erwin's the one humanity needed the most.

47
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:17,174
Captain!

48
00:05:17,597 --> 00:05:19,366
Why'd you give me the injection?

49
00:05:19,655 --> 00:05:21,300
Tch. Hey.

50
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:24,254
I thought I told you to tell him everything, Jaegar.

51
00:05:24,675 --> 00:05:26,032
There was a short debate.

52
00:05:26,265 --> 00:05:29,332
Your friends here argued that you
were the one we needed to revive.

53
00:05:29,899 --> 00:05:33,751
And when I disagreed, they staged a little mutiny.

54
00:05:35,207 --> 00:05:36,151
It's true.

55
00:05:36,374 --> 00:05:37,755
Punish us as you will.

56
00:05:38,957 --> 00:05:41,816
You'll certainly be disciplined for your insubordination.

57
00:05:42,438 --> 00:05:45,446
But getting punished isn't the same as making amends.

58
00:05:46,087 --> 00:05:47,019
I know.

59
00:05:48,788 --> 00:05:49,682
Thing is,

60
00:05:50,589 --> 00:05:53,241
I was the one who chose to revive you in the end.

61
00:05:54,124 --> 00:05:54,783
Or no.

62
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:59,375
It's more like I chose this to
be the place where Erwin died.

63
00:06:03,707 --> 00:06:05,689
Sorry. I just don't understand.

64
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:08,732
How could letting Erwin die be the right thing to do?

65
00:06:09,912 --> 00:06:11,504
What are the Scouts without him?

66
00:06:12,149 --> 00:06:16,111
If he's gone, then how will we go on?

67
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:17,717
You're right, Armin.

68
00:06:18,292 --> 00:06:20,666
I believe it should've been used on Erwin, too.

69
00:06:21,336 --> 00:06:23,494
To be brutally honest...

70
00:06:24,397 --> 00:06:25,234
Nevermind.

71
00:06:25,475 --> 00:06:27,828
It's a shame we had to choose in the first place.

72
00:06:31,192 --> 00:06:32,162
It's over now.

73
00:06:32,393 --> 00:06:35,283
Erwin told Levi to use the syringe as he thought best.

74
00:06:35,706 --> 00:06:37,683
And Levi chose to use it on you.

75
00:06:38,653 --> 00:06:39,945
What's done is done.

76
00:06:41,024 --> 00:06:44,840
Erwin's life and the power of a
Titan both rest on your shoulders.

77
00:06:45,484 --> 00:06:48,281
No matter what anyone says, that's the truth.

78
00:06:48,384 --> 00:06:50,146
It's part of who you are now.

79
00:06:50,382 --> 00:06:51,506
Accept it.

80
00:06:52,899 --> 00:06:55,303
Wait... so does this...

81
00:06:55,941 --> 00:06:59,221
...mean that I need to become Erwin's replacement?

82
00:06:59,983 --> 00:07:00,858
There's no way.

83
00:07:01,533 --> 00:07:02,905
I can't!

84
00:07:05,774 --> 00:07:07,434
Don't misunderstand us.

85
00:07:07,698 --> 00:07:10,557
There's no chance in hell that you could replace Erwin.

86
00:07:11,649 --> 00:07:12,758
That said,

87
00:07:13,446 --> 00:07:14,846
your self-doubt aside,

88
00:07:15,012 --> 00:07:17,715
you have a strength within you that no one else can claim.

89
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:21,227
Don't let any of us regret this.

90
00:07:22,055 --> 00:07:22,801
Not me,

91
00:07:23,268 --> 00:07:25,502
not either one of our mutineers here,

92
00:07:26,441 --> 00:07:27,821
nor anyone else.

93
00:07:29,608 --> 00:07:31,880
And especially don't regret it yourself.

94
00:07:33,196 --> 00:07:35,018
Consider that your new mission.

95
00:07:43,431 --> 00:07:44,626
Shut the hell up.

96
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:54,538
Yup. That's our Sasha.

97
00:07:54,938 --> 00:07:57,169
She's always been one to speak her mind.

98
00:07:57,691 --> 00:07:58,330
You know,

99
00:07:58,781 --> 00:08:01,664
since Erwin chose me to succeed him as commander,

100
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:03,834
I'm more or less in the same boat as you.

101
00:08:05,149 --> 00:08:07,101
We'll just have to grin and bear it,

102
00:08:07,222 --> 00:08:08,967
while doing what we can.

103
00:08:09,884 --> 00:08:10,740
I'll try.

104
00:08:12,608 --> 00:08:13,299
Good.

105
00:08:14,233 --> 00:08:15,818
Now that we know Armin's all right,

106
00:08:15,899 --> 00:08:17,286
let's check out that cellar.

107
00:08:17,938 --> 00:08:19,216
Eren, Mikasa.

108
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:21,974
You two can come guide me and Levi.

109
00:08:22,316 --> 00:08:25,977
The rest of you stay. Keep an eye
out for hostiles from here on the wall.

110
00:08:26,191 --> 00:08:26,955
...Got it.

111
00:08:27,998 --> 00:08:30,443
Eren, do you still have the key?

112
00:08:32,361 --> 00:08:33,194
I do.

113
00:08:35,212 --> 00:08:36,618
Let's do this.

114
00:08:38,524 --> 00:08:39,129
Eren.

115
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:43,865
Behave while I'm gone and I'll let you
in on what I've been doing in the cellar.

116
00:08:44,163 --> 00:08:45,041
Agreed?

117
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:46,757
Eren!

118
00:08:47,332 --> 00:08:49,942
How many times have I told you to stay out of there?

119
00:08:50,188 --> 00:08:52,247
I don't get why it's such a big deal.

120
00:08:52,669 --> 00:08:55,392
Because your father keeps his work tools down there.

121
00:08:55,495 --> 00:08:56,513
Medicine, too.

122
00:08:56,983 --> 00:08:58,467
It's dangerous for children.

123
00:09:00,504 --> 00:09:01,558
Fine.

124
00:09:11,105 --> 00:09:12,991
It's why I ask your intentions.

125
00:09:13,649 --> 00:09:16,168
They could be the key to turning the tide forever.

126
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,495
You could save us.

127
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:23,892
Intel suggests that the cellar of Jaeger's home in
Shiganshina holds a vital secret regarding our enemy.

128
00:09:24,365 --> 00:09:27,244
We will form an expedition to find this secret.

129
00:09:28,131 --> 00:09:29,190
With that achieved,

130
00:09:29,327 --> 00:09:31,874
we may finally be able to break free from the Titans,

131
00:09:32,063 --> 00:09:34,059
and bring an end to their hundred-year reign.

132
00:10:03,338 --> 00:10:05,664
Well, takes us to your house.

133
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,231
Yeah. Right.

134
00:12:00,366 --> 00:12:01,787
Is this the place?

135
00:12:25,691 --> 00:12:26,672
Hey, Dad!

136
00:12:26,899 --> 00:12:29,007
When'll you show me what's in the cellar?

137
00:12:29,899 --> 00:12:30,731
Well,

138
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,285
perhaps when you've realized
the most important thing of all.

139
00:12:57,733 --> 00:13:01,215
Luckily for us, the fires burnt
out before they got this far.

140
00:13:22,308 --> 00:13:23,238
This is it.

141
00:13:23,664 --> 00:13:26,329
The stairs to the cellar are beneath this door.

142
00:13:26,538 --> 00:13:27,599
All right.

143
00:13:50,733 --> 00:13:51,689
That's a relief.

144
00:13:51,714 --> 00:13:53,643
I was worried that it might've flooded by now.

145
00:13:55,992 --> 00:13:56,860
Let's go.

146
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:18,201
Do it, Eren.

147
00:14:18,972 --> 00:14:19,893
Right.

148
00:14:30,357 --> 00:14:31,230
You okay?

149
00:14:31,566 --> 00:14:32,382
What's wrong?

150
00:14:32,899 --> 00:14:33,924
Hurry it up.

151
00:14:35,931 --> 00:14:36,941
I can't.

152
00:14:37,235 --> 00:14:38,117
The key...

153
00:14:38,443 --> 00:14:40,024
It doesn't go to this door.

154
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:41,820
What?

155
00:14:42,322 --> 00:14:43,766
That doesn't make sense.

156
00:14:44,071 --> 00:14:46,436
I'm sure it's the key that Dr. Jaeger had.

157
00:14:46,939 --> 00:14:49,231
Step aside. I'll open it.

158
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,765
Wait, what?

159
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:55,884
That'll do it.

160
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:19,430
It almost feels like a laboratory down here.

161
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,750
My dad was a doctor,

162
00:15:22,332 --> 00:15:25,431
so he was always cooped up down here mixing medicines.

163
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:27,020
That makes sense.

164
00:15:27,414 --> 00:15:32,373
Actually, if we assume that
all of this is labeled accurately,

165
00:15:32,477 --> 00:15:34,917
most of it seems to be widely available.

166
00:15:35,329 --> 00:15:37,714
And all of the books on hand relate to medicine.

167
00:15:37,858 --> 00:15:40,098
This looks like a normal doctor's study.

168
00:15:40,691 --> 00:15:43,768
There isn't a single thing here
that would rouse my suspicion,

169
00:15:43,941 --> 00:15:46,008
as I'm sure your father intended.

170
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:47,208
Right.

171
00:15:47,722 --> 00:15:50,624
If you wanna hide something from the Interior Police,

172
00:15:50,712 --> 00:15:52,920
you wanna be sure not to give them any leads.

173
00:15:54,683 --> 00:15:55,320
Hey.

174
00:15:55,685 --> 00:15:57,410
Don't just stand there, get to work.

175
00:15:57,913 --> 00:15:59,826
Erwin's hunches are rarely wrong.

176
00:16:00,805 --> 00:16:01,526
Right.

177
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:22,968
Thanks for the drink, Mikasa.

178
00:16:23,294 --> 00:16:24,843
Looks like another all-nighter.

179
00:16:31,733 --> 00:16:32,342
Eren.

180
00:16:32,593 --> 00:16:33,573
Hm?

181
00:16:34,296 --> 00:16:36,418
Look. I found a keyhole.

182
00:16:42,465 --> 00:16:43,274
Try it.

183
00:16:49,837 --> 00:16:50,765
That got it.

184
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,145
It's empty?

185
00:16:58,407 --> 00:16:59,362
Look closer.

186
00:17:00,884 --> 00:17:02,024
There's a false bottom.

187
00:17:08,387 --> 00:17:10,915
The cloth smells like peppermint oil and charcoal.

188
00:17:11,605 --> 00:17:14,737
Guess he was using these to ward off moisture and bugs.

189
00:17:14,899 --> 00:17:18,726
If what we were looking for exists, then we've found it.

190
00:17:27,105 --> 00:17:28,744
After all this time,

191
00:17:28,899 --> 00:17:31,253
Dad might finally explain himself.

192
00:17:54,294 --> 00:17:55,945
Then Erwin raised his hand

193
00:17:56,249 --> 00:17:57,861
and asked the strangest question.

194
00:17:59,082 --> 00:18:02,994
"How can we be sure there aren't other
humans living far away from the walls?"

195
00:18:04,555 --> 00:18:09,120
His thinking was that since we'd never
been able to search freely beyond the walls,

196
00:18:09,265 --> 00:18:13,719
we had no way of confirming that the rest of
humanity had been wiped out by Titans completely.

197
00:18:14,816 --> 00:18:17,811
And yet, that's exactly what our historians would claim.

198
00:18:18,167 --> 00:18:18,652
Hmm?

199
00:18:19,483 --> 00:18:20,099
Think.

200
00:18:20,816 --> 00:18:23,436
If our history books would claim to be unbiased,

201
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:27,218
the phrasing should be "it's believed
that the rest of mankind was killed."

202
00:18:27,733 --> 00:18:29,066
If I'm being honest,

203
00:18:29,124 --> 00:18:30,999
I feel like you're just splitting hairs here.

204
00:18:31,024 --> 00:18:32,000
I'm not!

205
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,956
This was a deliberate choice they made!

206
00:18:34,441 --> 00:18:35,402
These books...

207
00:18:35,816 --> 00:18:38,733
They're commissioned and issued
by the royal government itself.

208
00:18:38,774 --> 00:18:39,415
Get it?

209
00:18:40,006 --> 00:18:44,024
Their intent is to make us
believe we're the only humans left.

210
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:46,471
Maybe they just assumed.

211
00:18:46,639 --> 00:18:48,989
Aren't you reading a little too far into this?

212
00:18:51,094 --> 00:18:52,961
Back then I made fun of his theory,

213
00:18:53,222 --> 00:18:54,661
but he may have been right.

214
00:18:54,988 --> 00:18:57,925
If he is, you'll just have to apologize to him.

215
00:19:01,215 --> 00:19:02,199
Look there.

216
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:03,980
The sun's rising.

217
00:19:04,397 --> 00:19:08,188
If our heroes are going to return, it should be soon.

218
00:19:08,233 --> 00:19:09,774
Um! Pardon!

219
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:11,781
But the Scouts came back a moment ago!

220
00:19:12,007 --> 00:19:14,865
They did it! They reclaimed Wall Maria!

221
00:19:37,986 --> 00:19:40,169
Is this a painting?

222
00:19:41,649 --> 00:19:43,093
Let me look closer.

223
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:45,142
No.

224
00:19:45,549 --> 00:19:48,838
This is far too detailed to
have been drawn by a human hand.

225
00:19:48,965 --> 00:19:49,916
Uh... hey.

226
00:19:49,941 --> 00:19:51,244
There's writing on the back.

227
00:19:53,399 --> 00:19:54,883
"This is no illustration.

228
00:19:55,539 --> 00:19:59,111
It was made by gathering the
light reflected off the subject"...

229
00:19:59,316 --> 00:20:02,083
...and burning it into an image on special paper.

230
00:20:02,358 --> 00:20:04,179
Looks quite nice, right?

231
00:20:05,155 --> 00:20:06,054
Where I'm from,

232
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:08,686
there are many amazing technologies like this.

233
00:20:08,733 --> 00:20:09,901
Mankind isn't gone.

234
00:20:11,249 --> 00:20:12,395
Beyond the walls,

235
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:15,414
countless humans live in comfortable refinement.

236
00:20:15,746 --> 00:20:19,589
I pray the person who finds
this book will be a fellow patriot.

237
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:42,740
Hurry, Fay! If we're not fast, we'll miss it!

238
00:21:42,999 --> 00:21:44,503
Wait up, Grisha!

239
00:21:45,347 --> 00:21:47,309
Not so fast. Come here.

240
00:21:48,039 --> 00:21:49,240
Don't forget again.

241
00:21:49,917 --> 00:21:52,228
You can't go outside without your armbands.

242
00:21:52,764 --> 00:21:53,578
And Grisha,

243
00:21:53,968 --> 00:21:56,177
you mustn't go past the walls for any reason.

244
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:57,647
Hey, wait for me!

245
00:21:59,329 --> 00:22:00,849
Don't worry, Mom, we'll be good.

246
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,580
Yeah, we'll see ya later, okay?

247
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:03,915
...So where to?

248
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:05,153
...This way. Come on!

249
00:22:11,585 --> 00:22:13,037
When I first considered

250
00:22:13,422 --> 00:22:15,475
how best I should start my story,

251
00:22:16,108 --> 00:22:17,931
my thoughts turned to that day at once.

252
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:20,442
Hey!

253
00:22:21,625 --> 00:22:22,226
...Grisha?

254
00:22:22,349 --> 00:22:23,048
...Sorry 'bout that!

255
00:22:23,073 --> 00:22:24,392
Watch where you're going, will you?

256
00:22:24,555 --> 00:22:25,931
And slow down a bit!

257
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:30,834
Aww, it's leaving.

258
00:22:32,566 --> 00:22:33,583
I love it!

259
00:22:34,105 --> 00:22:35,387
When I'm rich someday,

260
00:22:35,513 --> 00:22:38,738
I wanna ride in an airship
that looks exactly like that one!

261
00:22:40,624 --> 00:22:42,067
What are you talking about?

262
00:22:42,186 --> 00:22:44,388
There's no way either of us'll get rich.

263
00:22:44,874 --> 00:22:47,860
I know, but it's nice to pretend.

264
00:22:48,358 --> 00:22:50,856
I wonder what all we could see from up there.

265
00:22:56,816 --> 00:22:58,395
There it goes.

266
00:23:12,124 --> 00:23:13,707
...Come on, Fay! ...Hey! Wait!

267
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:14,709
Where are we going?

268
00:23:14,734 --> 00:23:16,109
My teacher told me something.

269
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:18,284
He said the airships land at a place nearby.

270
00:23:18,483 --> 00:23:19,583
Let's go and watch!

271
00:23:19,752 --> 00:23:20,633
Really?

272
00:23:20,849 --> 00:23:23,511
But Mom said we shouldn't leave the walls no matter what!

273
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:25,728
It'll be fine! We'll just be gone for a minute!

274
00:23:26,125 --> 00:23:27,284
...Be right back, sir!

275
00:23:27,586 --> 00:23:28,738
Stop right there!

276
00:23:30,024 --> 00:23:33,347
The fateful day that I, just a naive youth,

277
00:23:33,972 --> 00:23:36,548
was made to face the truth of this world.

278
00:23:41,576 --> 00:23:45,208
His story began when he took his
sister's hand and stepped forward,

279
00:23:46,033 --> 00:23:47,835
while gazing up at the sky.

280
00:23:48,233 --> 00:23:53,492
The hope and hatred in his eyes show Eren
a world far from his own, but just as cruel.

281
00:23:53,698 --> 00:23:56,111
Next episode: "That Day."
