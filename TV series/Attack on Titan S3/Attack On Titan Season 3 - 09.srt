1
00:00:03,667 --> 00:00:09,311
The true king within the walls, Rod
Reiss, found his schemes laid to waste.

2
00:00:09,722 --> 00:00:14,260
While Levi Squad was successful
in rescuing both Eren and Historia.

3
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:15,800
However...

4
00:00:16,483 --> 00:00:19,605
Seeing his hopes dashed on the ground before him,

5
00:00:19,715 --> 00:00:22,561
Rod Reiss himself became a Titan.

6
00:00:22,894 --> 00:00:25,374
I just wanted to believe my father was right.

7
00:00:25,564 --> 00:00:28,734
Even more than that, I wanted him to like me.

8
00:00:31,124 --> 00:00:33,764
But it’s time for me and him to part ways now.

9
00:00:33,994 --> 00:00:37,275
Once you’re queen you can punch
that smug runt right in the face.

10
00:00:37,497 --> 00:00:40,254
How can we evacuate the people in such a short time?

11
00:00:40,429 --> 00:00:41,954
That’s not part of the plan.

12
00:00:42,327 --> 00:00:43,845
The people of Orvud District

13
00:00:44,195 --> 00:00:46,236
will need to stay exactly where they are.

14
00:03:10,659 --> 00:03:12,581
What the hell are you thinking, Erwin?

15
00:03:13,073 --> 00:03:16,657
If we don’t get these civilians out of
the city, they’ll die by the thousands!

16
00:03:17,014 --> 00:03:20,495
That hulking monstrosity will be a
stone’s throw from the wall by morning!

17
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:22,529
That Titan is an Abnormal.

18
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:24,872
Right, and what the hell does that even mean?

19
00:03:25,245 --> 00:03:30,521
It behaves strangely. Unlike most Titans we
encounter, it’s only attracted to large groups of people.

20
00:03:30,736 --> 00:03:32,251
Hence the word "abnormal."

21
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:36,677
Put simply, given the choice between a
few soldiers right next to it and a distant,

22
00:03:36,702 --> 00:03:39,746
but densely populated city, it’ll choose the city.

23
00:03:40,436 --> 00:03:45,592
So if we were to evacuate Orvud’s populace
to the interior of Wall Sina right now,

24
00:03:45,743 --> 00:03:50,375
the Titan would change its course, destroying
the wall and anything else in its path.

25
00:03:51,001 --> 00:03:56,071
Left unchecked, it would make for the city
with the greatest density of people, Mitras.

26
00:03:56,182 --> 00:04:00,354
The ensuing rampage would deliver
a devastating blow to humanity.

27
00:04:02,012 --> 00:04:08,543
As we rode for Orvud, we had Eren Jaeger attempt to
use his recently discovered power to control Titans.

28
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,562
Rod Reiss’ Titan didn’t react in any way.

29
00:04:19,665 --> 00:04:23,536
Stop moving, now! I said stop!

30
00:04:23,727 --> 00:04:25,951
Hey, I’m talkin’ to you!

31
00:04:26,118 --> 00:04:28,548
Hey asshole! Ya hear me?

32
00:04:28,627 --> 00:04:32,449
C’mon, you stupid old bastard! Why won’t you listen?

33
00:04:40,237 --> 00:04:41,769
If we’re to stop this thing,

34
00:04:42,102 --> 00:04:44,883
it’ll have to be outside the walls of Orvud District.

35
00:04:45,383 --> 00:04:49,388
For that to happen, we require
the citizens here to act as bait.

36
00:04:50,717 --> 00:04:56,428
However, this doesn’t change the fact that our first
and foremost duty as soldiers is to protect the people.

37
00:04:58,172 --> 00:05:00,527
In the event that we’re unable to halt the target,

38
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:03,341
we’ll take measures to minimize civilian losses.

39
00:05:05,361 --> 00:05:08,163
We’ll announce a district-wide evacuation drill tonight.

40
00:05:08,431 --> 00:05:13,142
The people will be gathered away from the
outer wall, ready to escape if the battle is lost.

41
00:05:20,905 --> 00:05:22,980
It seems there’s no other choice.

42
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,714
The body of this Titan is the largest we’ve seen yet.

43
00:05:27,286 --> 00:05:29,583
As such, it presents an easy target.

44
00:05:30,394 --> 00:05:33,324
Our wall-mounted cannons should prove highly effective,

45
00:05:33,991 --> 00:05:36,519
but if we can’t bring it down with artillery...

46
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,126
...the Scout Regiment will throw everything we have at it.

47
00:06:12,615 --> 00:06:16,569
As part of this drill, dummy
Titans and cannons will be utilized!

48
00:06:16,797 --> 00:06:20,064
This will be a large-scale
exercise like nothing you’ve seen!

49
00:06:20,567 --> 00:06:24,848
However, we ask that you remain calm,
follow our instructions and remember...

50
00:06:24,873 --> 00:06:30,750
Ma’am. I really gotta go get my store
ready for the day. Can’t you let us go home?

51
00:06:30,917 --> 00:06:32,832
You won’t have any customers today.

52
00:06:33,165 --> 00:06:34,009
...Take the day off.

53
00:06:34,072 --> 00:06:35,922
...I’ve got a living to make.

54
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:39,027
This is Northern Sina, why are we having drills?

55
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:41,652
The military ousts the king, and now this?

56
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:42,804
What do you mean?

57
00:06:43,627 --> 00:06:47,459
I’m saying that the military’s only
doing this to demonstrate their power.

58
00:06:47,697 --> 00:06:51,423
Now that the fake king’s gone, they
wanna remind us that they’re in control.

59
00:06:51,737 --> 00:06:55,164
You mean they’re puttin’ us through
all this just to flex their damn muscles?

60
00:06:55,283 --> 00:07:00,138
Yeah. At this point, I think I prefer
the fake king. Even if he was incompetent.

61
00:07:02,677 --> 00:07:04,326
Hey! Look over there!

62
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:10,285
Smoke?

63
00:07:11,817 --> 00:07:12,835
Fire!

64
00:07:43,757 --> 00:07:45,543
Well. How’d that do?

65
00:08:01,609 --> 00:08:02,863
Fire!

66
00:08:06,496 --> 00:08:09,188
Looks like the field cannons are even less effective.

67
00:08:09,553 --> 00:08:10,611
Makes sense.

68
00:08:10,928 --> 00:08:13,231
The cannons on the wall have a way better angle,

69
00:08:13,461 --> 00:08:15,289
and they didn’t do shit to it either.

70
00:08:15,847 --> 00:08:17,204
What’s the problem?

71
00:08:17,657 --> 00:08:21,178
Unprepared soldiers. Scraped together cannons.

72
00:08:21,313 --> 00:08:22,918
And shallow leadership.

73
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:25,827
The Titans have always attacked from the south.

74
00:08:26,162 --> 00:08:29,482
Not only is this a northern
garrison, it’s in the interior.

75
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:34,686
Therefore, I can tell you for a
fact this is the best we’ll get.

76
00:08:35,241 --> 00:08:37,880
Yeah. That much is painfully clear.

77
00:08:39,239 --> 00:08:44,083
And of course your strategy for getting us
through this battle comes down to a gamble.

78
00:08:44,599 --> 00:08:47,217
Just like every other plan that you’ve come up with.

79
00:08:47,252 --> 00:08:49,930
Erwin! I brought the goodies!

80
00:08:50,462 --> 00:08:53,164
All the gunpowder, ropes, and netting I could find!

81
00:08:53,315 --> 00:08:54,962
We still need to put it together, though.

82
00:08:55,102 --> 00:08:56,779
Ooh! Got this too.

83
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:59,297
There’s another one just like it a bit further down.

84
00:08:59,535 --> 00:09:01,896
The trigger’s held in place, so once fired,

85
00:09:01,927 --> 00:09:04,979
it’ll wind itself right back up, just like ODM gear.

86
00:09:05,471 --> 00:09:07,609
So. We do any damage?

87
00:09:07,998 --> 00:09:10,737
Imagine a swarm of cicadas pissing on it.

88
00:09:10,762 --> 00:09:13,551
Then we’ll actually use these things. Exciting.

89
00:09:14,777 --> 00:09:17,666
Captain Levi. Jean. Sasha. Conny.

90
00:09:18,309 --> 00:09:19,358
You handle that side.

91
00:09:19,745 --> 00:09:20,771
Yes, sir!

92
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,207
How should we approach this? Lemme see.

93
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:31,790
Think of it like we’re wrapping
up a nice gift for someone special.

94
00:09:32,064 --> 00:09:34,872
I believe you heard from Levi, Historia.

95
00:09:35,382 --> 00:09:41,340
Assuming we live through this, we’ll have you
become the queen who rules this world within the walls.

96
00:09:42,523 --> 00:09:45,662
So naturally, I can’t have you fighting on the front line.

97
00:09:46,807 --> 00:09:48,545
I doubt that plan will work.

98
00:09:49,277 --> 00:09:51,898
The people won’t bow to a queen in name alone.

99
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:53,574
They aren’t that naïve.

100
00:09:57,119 --> 00:09:59,017
Exactly what are you suggesting?

101
00:09:59,499 --> 00:10:00,771
Fire!

102
00:10:07,367 --> 00:10:12,586
Historia. It’s amazing how strong she’s become.

103
00:10:12,705 --> 00:10:13,786
Let me act like the...

104
00:10:13,811 --> 00:10:16,352
At first I thought she was the weakest of us.

105
00:10:16,807 --> 00:10:17,756
But no.

106
00:10:19,977 --> 00:10:21,524
I was the weak one.

107
00:10:23,631 --> 00:10:27,253
Somewhere along the line, I decided I was special.

108
00:10:27,999 --> 00:10:29,156
And ’cause of that, when other soldiers

109
00:10:29,535 --> 00:10:33,985
died for my sake, I accepted it as natural.

110
00:10:34,326 --> 00:10:36,703
And the same goes for my Titan powers.

111
00:10:37,885 --> 00:10:40,191
I hated Titans more than anything.

112
00:10:40,941 --> 00:10:44,044
But when I became one I thought nothing of it.

113
00:10:44,173 --> 00:10:46,944
Because I wanted to believe that strength was my own.

114
00:10:48,445 --> 00:10:50,582
That’s the thinking of a weakling.

115
00:10:55,977 --> 00:10:57,693
Where’ll we go from here?

116
00:10:58,021 --> 00:11:00,617
So what if I’m able to reseal the wall?

117
00:11:01,299 --> 00:11:03,627
I’m still not about to save mankind.

118
00:11:04,065 --> 00:11:06,288
I’m not special. I’m nobody.

119
00:11:09,217 --> 00:11:13,469
But really, it’s humanity that
got the short end of the stick here.

120
00:11:14,135 --> 00:11:16,616
’Cause they’re stuck with me as their trump card.

121
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:24,433
Hey.

122
00:11:27,894 --> 00:11:29,996
Take a look at those kids down there.

123
00:11:31,035 --> 00:11:33,133
They’re just like us on that day.

124
00:11:35,587 --> 00:11:38,217
Yeah. We were clueless too.

125
00:11:38,242 --> 00:11:41,889
We had no idea a Titan taller than
the walls was about to attack us, either.

126
00:11:43,457 --> 00:11:46,489
They might end up seeing the
same sight that we did that day.

127
00:11:47,372 --> 00:11:49,754
Thing is, it’s different this time.

128
00:11:49,949 --> 00:11:52,852
Those kids will have soldiers
who are ready to protect them.

129
00:11:53,328 --> 00:11:55,125
Those kids will have us.

130
00:11:55,762 --> 00:11:58,080
Yeah, stack that one up on the edge.

131
00:12:09,247 --> 00:12:13,270
Eren. We’re running out of
time here. Keep your hands busy.

132
00:12:17,497 --> 00:12:18,285
Eren!

133
00:12:19,751 --> 00:12:22,200
Hey! Stop! Why are you...?

134
00:12:23,796 --> 00:12:26,412
Were you making a wound? It’s not time yet.

135
00:12:27,087 --> 00:12:31,560
It wasn’t that. I just needed to beat
the shit out of a useless brat real quick.

136
00:12:31,658 --> 00:12:34,364
With any luck, he’s dead and gone now.

137
00:12:40,332 --> 00:12:43,018
The enemy is moving! Adjust your aim!

138
00:12:43,747 --> 00:12:45,687
Our target is the back of its neck!

139
00:12:47,423 --> 00:12:48,652
Fire!

140
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:58,804
Well done! We’ve torn into its flesh!

141
00:12:59,036 --> 00:13:00,246
One more volley, and we...

142
00:13:03,411 --> 00:13:04,516
So hot!

143
00:13:04,632 --> 00:13:06,900
Damn it. That’s just our luck.

144
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:10,150
The wind must’ve shifted.

145
00:13:10,229 --> 00:13:13,105
What do we do? I can’t see, Captain!

146
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:16,354
It doesn’t matter... the target’s
right beneath us! Keep shooting!

147
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:26,842
That wasn’t enough.

148
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:46,770
It’s a Titan.

149
00:14:08,735 --> 00:14:09,905
Titan!

150
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:11,630
Please! You have to stay calm!

151
00:14:11,675 --> 00:14:12,761
Shut up!

152
00:14:21,071 --> 00:14:23,580
We’re falling back! Everyone run!

153
00:14:25,765 --> 00:14:28,053
Shit. It’s breaking through.

154
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:30,571
The city I grew up in...

155
00:14:31,015 --> 00:14:33,257
...is about to be devastated.

156
00:14:34,917 --> 00:14:36,936
The Garrison has done its duty.

157
00:14:37,991 --> 00:14:39,906
Let the Scouts take it from here.

158
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:42,253
...Looks like we’re up, Eren.

159
00:14:42,277 --> 00:14:42,931
...Right.

160
00:14:45,028 --> 00:14:48,016
Armin. There’s one more thing that’s different from then.

161
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:48,985
Huh?

162
00:14:49,104 --> 00:14:52,671
It’s not all we’d hoped for, but it’s something.

163
00:14:53,067 --> 00:14:55,019
Mankind has an ace up its sleeve.

164
00:15:00,725 --> 00:15:02,881
Wait a second. Another one?

165
00:15:05,774 --> 00:15:07,043
All set, Commander!

166
00:15:19,539 --> 00:15:20,554
On my mark.

167
00:15:22,534 --> 00:15:23,161
Now!

168
00:15:33,723 --> 00:15:35,130
Take this!

169
00:15:49,003 --> 00:15:50,995
All right! It’s losing balance!

170
00:15:56,993 --> 00:15:58,837
Eren! Do it!

171
00:16:10,032 --> 00:16:13,470
So you’re saying, that to take this Titan down,

172
00:16:13,898 --> 00:16:16,258
we’re gonna stuff gunpowder down its throat

173
00:16:16,787 --> 00:16:19,532
and hope that’s enough to destroy the nape of the neck?

174
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,627
That’s correct.

175
00:16:20,917 --> 00:16:23,026
With all the heat the bastard’s making,

176
00:16:23,517 --> 00:16:26,355
I’d expect the powder to ignite without a detonator.

177
00:16:27,117 --> 00:16:30,709
Although a lot of this is banking
on the Titan hanging its mouth open.

178
00:16:31,558 --> 00:16:34,927
An explosion outside of the nape may not penetrate.

179
00:16:36,119 --> 00:16:39,004
The flesh inside its throat is softer. More vulnerable.

180
00:16:40,023 --> 00:16:41,983
But the target may protect that point.

181
00:16:42,529 --> 00:16:44,541
It’s been dragging its face along the ground.

182
00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:49,149
Frankly, we don’t even know that it has a mouth to open.

183
00:16:49,577 --> 00:16:51,141
That’s the gamble this time.

184
00:16:55,432 --> 00:16:56,894
I’ve got you!

185
00:17:17,027 --> 00:17:20,364
Go! Deploy your ODM gear and finish it off!

186
00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:22,699
Gigantic though it is,

187
00:17:23,005 --> 00:17:26,530
its vital point is still one meter
high, and ten centimeters across.

188
00:17:26,974 --> 00:17:29,978
Unless we destroy that, it will regenerate,

189
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,076
and form another shield of heat.

190
00:17:32,821 --> 00:17:34,604
We cannot waste this chance.

191
00:17:35,493 --> 00:17:37,257
Where is it? Which one?

192
00:17:38,321 --> 00:17:39,321
Historia?

193
00:17:40,489 --> 00:17:41,856
I understand your reasons,

194
00:17:41,975 --> 00:17:44,732
but I can’t approve you entering combat.

195
00:17:44,769 --> 00:17:46,700
Please, sir. I have to!

196
00:17:46,878 --> 00:17:50,508
I’ve finally found my purpose... the
duty I was actually meant to fulfill!

197
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:52,669
That’s why I’m standing here right now!

198
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:58,517
Well, at any rate, with my body as it is now,

199
00:17:59,403 --> 00:18:01,312
I can’t exactly stop you, can I?

200
00:18:04,663 --> 00:18:07,365
I’m sorry, Commander. I know this is selfish.

201
00:18:08,711 --> 00:18:11,821
But this is the first time I’ve stood against my parents.

202
00:18:13,433 --> 00:18:15,961
The first fight I’ve ever had with my father.

203
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:25,447
Father! You have to listen to me!

204
00:18:25,549 --> 00:18:28,014
You could easily eradicate the Titans for good!

205
00:18:28,164 --> 00:18:30,311
So why? Why won’t you just do it?

206
00:18:30,336 --> 00:18:33,631
I can handle it, brother. It’s fine. Pray for me.

207
00:18:34,075 --> 00:18:37,247
Alma, you’re the only one who understands.

208
00:18:37,303 --> 00:18:38,971
You can leave it to me, Father.

209
00:18:39,328 --> 00:18:42,149
I won’t lose to the ghosts of our ancestors.

210
00:18:42,765 --> 00:18:44,301
Oh, God.

211
00:19:08,226 --> 00:19:09,948
The Titan’s been destroyed.

212
00:19:10,477 --> 00:19:12,148
Hey. You okay?

213
00:19:12,593 --> 00:19:14,126
You’re not injured, are you?

214
00:19:15,873 --> 00:19:16,618
It looked like

215
00:19:16,745 --> 00:19:18,232
you dealt the final blow.

216
00:19:19,648 --> 00:19:22,888
Was that real? Or did I imagine it?

217
00:19:23,232 --> 00:19:25,090
Am I acting for myself?

218
00:19:25,828 --> 00:19:27,958
Or am I still just someone’s tool?

219
00:19:31,138 --> 00:19:34,989
I... don’t know. But...

220
00:19:36,396 --> 00:19:38,819
I’ve always just gone along with things.

221
00:19:39,673 --> 00:19:41,195
Till now, at least.

222
00:19:43,887 --> 00:19:44,812
It’s okay.

223
00:19:46,745 --> 00:19:48,640
My name is Historia Reiss.

224
00:19:49,757 --> 00:19:51,618
And I am your rightful queen.

225
00:20:05,602 --> 00:20:08,906
I must apologize. For I cannot die on this day.

226
00:20:09,814 --> 00:20:11,299
Please. Forgive me.

227
00:20:12,755 --> 00:20:15,842
You’re not deaf, are ya? Can you hear me or can’t ya?

228
00:20:17,388 --> 00:20:18,384
Got a name?

229
00:20:20,338 --> 00:20:22,904
Because of that, I’ll do anything he needs me to.

230
00:20:23,497 --> 00:20:25,081
Are you any different?

231
00:20:26,742 --> 00:20:29,435
What do I care? It’s fine by me.

232
00:20:30,251 --> 00:20:31,495
Captain Ackermann!

233
00:20:31,606 --> 00:20:34,339
No! Get back!

234
00:21:03,648 --> 00:21:04,306
Kenny.

235
00:21:11,242 --> 00:21:14,365
Ah, shit. Not you aga...

236
00:21:16,303 --> 00:21:20,236
Found what’s left of your squad. It
looks like they were crushed in the cave-in.

237
00:21:21,285 --> 00:21:23,264
I guess you were the only survivor?

238
00:21:24,749 --> 00:21:26,307
Mm. Sure looks that way.

239
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:33,291
Report back. I’m fine alone.

240
00:21:33,778 --> 00:21:34,841
Understood, sir.

241
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:46,733
Between the burns and the blood you’ve lost,

242
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:49,529
there’s nothing that can save you now.

243
00:21:53,163 --> 00:21:54,366
Oh, yeah?

244
00:21:56,347 --> 00:21:57,680
I wonder.

245
00:23:40,651 --> 00:23:44,225
Levi finds the man who raised him on the brink of death.

246
00:23:44,369 --> 00:23:48,536
In the haze of his fading mind, Kenny remembers someone...

247
00:23:48,913 --> 00:23:50,869
...that he once called a friend.

248
00:23:51,881 --> 00:23:54,579
Next episode: "Friends."
