1
00:00:01,587 --> 00:00:03,666
And as we ride to certain death,

2
00:00:03,927 --> 00:00:06,751
we trust our successors to do the same for us.

3
00:00:07,193 --> 00:00:11,951
Because my soldiers do not buckle or yield
when faced with the cruelty of this world.

4
00:00:13,024 --> 00:00:14,875
My soldiers push forward!

5
00:00:15,178 --> 00:00:17,062
My soldiers scream out!

6
00:00:17,545 --> 00:00:20,000
My soldiers rage!

7
00:00:33,725 --> 00:00:34,623
...The commander!

8
00:00:34,647 --> 00:00:36,031
...Ride. Don't look back!

9
00:00:36,158 --> 00:00:38,350
Keep charging!

10
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:24,501
How sad.

11
00:02:24,699 --> 00:02:27,964
To be deprived of the chance to learn from the past.

12
00:02:28,742 --> 00:02:32,849
King Reiss stole their memories of the
outside world, and this is the tragic result.

13
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:36,245
They're doomed to repeat the same foolish mistakes.

14
00:02:36,789 --> 00:02:39,999
And in the end, all of them will go to their deaths.

15
00:02:40,094 --> 00:02:43,367
Young and old, pouring out of
the walls in a suicide charge.

16
00:02:43,867 --> 00:02:45,557
Because if they're going to die,

17
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,659
they may as well do so proudly.

18
00:02:47,848 --> 00:02:49,275
What bullshit!

19
00:02:51,547 --> 00:02:53,343
I crushed it into dust?

20
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:56,717
Ha, ha. What's gotten into me?

21
00:02:57,537 --> 00:02:59,625
Why am I getting so worked up?

22
00:02:59,944 --> 00:03:02,151
You're not like your father, remember?

23
00:03:02,229 --> 00:03:04,444
You need to find joy where you can.

24
00:03:05,287 --> 00:03:09,671
So now, I'll turn them all
into proud little chunks of meat!

25
00:03:09,908 --> 00:03:12,182
The second volley's coming! Fire!

26
00:03:18,851 --> 00:03:20,062
It's coming.

27
00:03:24,983 --> 00:03:26,417
Is this how I die?

28
00:03:28,998 --> 00:03:31,169
I wonder what Hitch is doing?

29
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:34,758
Knowing her, she's probably still sleeping.

30
00:03:36,998 --> 00:03:38,468
Sounds nice.

31
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,972
But why am I thinking about her at a time like this?

32
00:03:54,438 --> 00:03:56,981
Yeah! Game over!

33
00:03:57,432 --> 00:03:59,563
Ha! How'd you like that?

34
00:03:59,857 --> 00:04:02,154
I thought I'd change up the pitch a little.

35
00:04:02,686 --> 00:04:04,774
I'd call that a shutout.

36
00:04:10,693 --> 00:04:12,433
Fire!

37
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,545
Foolish.

38
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:20,371
You really think those little toy guns are going to help?

39
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,270
And all that screaming.

40
00:04:24,404 --> 00:04:26,883
What good could that possibly do?!

41
00:04:36,965 --> 00:04:38,339
How sad.

42
00:04:38,489 --> 00:04:40,220
Poor, pathetic things.

43
00:04:43,598 --> 00:04:44,434
Hmm?

44
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:48,112
What's this?

45
00:04:48,676 --> 00:04:50,415
My Titans have fallen?

46
00:05:04,709 --> 00:05:05,369
Huh?

47
00:05:05,726 --> 00:05:08,308
A single soldier might pose a threat to me?

48
00:05:08,379 --> 00:05:11,034
Yes. Captain Levi is dangerous.

49
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:13,965
Is this Levi?

50
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,243
My nape!

51
00:05:19,107 --> 00:05:19,878
What the?

52
00:05:20,392 --> 00:05:21,428
I can't see!

53
00:05:23,191 --> 00:05:24,804
Did he take out my eyes?

54
00:05:27,304 --> 00:05:28,465
My legs!

55
00:05:29,856 --> 00:05:32,827
What's wrong? Not enjoying yourself so much anymore?

56
00:05:35,337 --> 00:05:36,912
Tch. I'll harden!

57
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:38,591
I won't make it in time!

58
00:05:38,681 --> 00:05:40,909
Come on, let's have some fun!

59
00:06:03,643 --> 00:06:07,433
After transforming, if your body's severely damaged,

60
00:06:07,568 --> 00:06:10,429
it's too busy healing to let you resume your Titan form.

61
00:06:10,746 --> 00:06:11,945
Isn't that right?

62
00:06:14,917 --> 00:06:17,270
Hey. I asked a question.

63
00:06:17,428 --> 00:06:19,337
It's only polite to answer.

64
00:06:21,165 --> 00:06:22,649
I can't kill him yet.

65
00:06:23,524 --> 00:06:25,884
There must be someone out there who's still alive.

66
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:29,211
It doesn't matter if they're on the brink of death.

67
00:06:30,029 --> 00:06:32,524
I can inject them and make them a Titan.

68
00:06:34,367 --> 00:06:36,369
Then we just have them eat this guy,

69
00:06:36,876 --> 00:06:38,871
and the Beast Titan's power is ours.

70
00:06:40,286 --> 00:06:43,837
If there's one person still breathing, I can save them.

71
00:06:59,116 --> 00:07:01,133
Hey. Where are you going?

72
00:07:01,395 --> 00:07:02,128
Stop.

73
00:07:03,659 --> 00:07:06,074
Go, now! Rip him to pieces!

74
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:15,022
It hurts!

75
00:07:15,148 --> 00:07:17,111
They were right about you, Levi!

76
00:07:17,435 --> 00:07:19,241
You are dangerous.

77
00:07:19,462 --> 00:07:22,355
But you must've used all your weapons up by now.

78
00:07:22,498 --> 00:07:24,293
You'll die like the rest of them!

79
00:07:24,396 --> 00:07:28,305
It may have been a hard-won fight, but victory is ours!

80
00:07:28,718 --> 00:07:29,687
Hold on.

81
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,840
I made a promise to Commander Erwin...

82
00:07:33,673 --> 00:07:36,041
...that I would kill you no matter what it took.

83
00:07:38,357 --> 00:07:39,597
I promised!

84
00:07:48,725 --> 00:07:49,583
There's no way.

85
00:07:49,812 --> 00:07:52,061
I'm alive? How's that possible?

86
00:07:53,178 --> 00:07:54,047
The others!

87
00:07:57,947 --> 00:07:58,679
Hey!

88
00:07:59,497 --> 00:08:01,221
Is anyone else out there?

89
00:08:07,178 --> 00:08:08,561
That bastard.

90
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:11,241
What'll take to put him down for good?

91
00:08:11,827 --> 00:08:13,711
Why won't he just stay dead?

92
00:08:15,276 --> 00:08:18,637
What the hell do we do against something like that?

93
00:08:20,671 --> 00:08:21,418
Hey, Armin.

94
00:08:21,862 --> 00:08:25,463
I think getting Eren out of here
safely might be the best we can hope for.

95
00:08:26,162 --> 00:08:27,487
He's thinner.

96
00:08:28,265 --> 00:08:28,860
Huh?

97
00:08:29,584 --> 00:08:30,878
The Colossal Titan.

98
00:08:31,443 --> 00:08:32,992
He's gotten a little thinner.

99
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:36,726
Guys! It's exactly like Hange said!

100
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:39,976
Our best bet against the
Colossal is a battle of attrition!

101
00:08:41,255 --> 00:08:43,456
You remember her experiments with Eren?

102
00:08:44,847 --> 00:08:47,335
He could only transform up to three times.

103
00:08:47,581 --> 00:08:49,884
If that's the case for a 15-meter Titan,

104
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:53,046
a 60-meter might be even less efficient!

105
00:08:53,728 --> 00:08:55,461
And then there's his steam.

106
00:08:55,738 --> 00:08:59,426
I think he must be burning through
flesh and muscle tissue to produce it.

107
00:08:59,862 --> 00:09:02,009
Everything except for his skeleton.

108
00:09:02,691 --> 00:09:04,113
So, what are you saying?

109
00:09:04,296 --> 00:09:04,979
Armin.

110
00:09:05,724 --> 00:09:06,782
I have a plan.

111
00:09:07,195 --> 00:09:09,340
The rest of you need to draw Reiner away.

112
00:09:09,578 --> 00:09:12,566
Eren and I will defeat the Colossal Titan ourselves.

113
00:09:15,266 --> 00:09:16,697
The two of us can do it.

114
00:09:16,814 --> 00:09:17,980
Trust me on this.

115
00:09:20,329 --> 00:09:21,225
All right, then.

116
00:09:21,876 --> 00:09:24,095
You leave Reiner to us and get going.

117
00:09:25,953 --> 00:09:27,351
Sure took ya long enough.

118
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:30,012
You had me thinkin' we were all gonna die here.

119
00:09:36,544 --> 00:09:37,879
Couldn't tell you why, but...

120
00:09:38,968 --> 00:09:41,455
...when I think about the freedom that we all lost...

121
00:09:44,101 --> 00:09:46,150
...I feel strong and fearless.

122
00:09:55,739 --> 00:09:58,075
If this plan goes the way I'm hoping it will,

123
00:09:58,696 --> 00:09:59,283
well...

124
00:10:00,079 --> 00:10:02,096
...I won't get to visit the sea.

125
00:10:04,748 --> 00:10:07,871
I couldn't tell you why, but
when I think of the outside world,

126
00:10:08,228 --> 00:10:10,069
I feel courage flow through me.

127
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:18,359
Eren, wake up!

128
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,960
The sea is waiting for us.

129
00:10:48,636 --> 00:10:51,441
Okay, that's the plan, more or less.

130
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,825
So now we just have to execute it.

131
00:10:55,157 --> 00:10:57,609
If we can succeed in tricking Bertholdt, then...

132
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,481
we'll win.

133
00:11:00,053 --> 00:11:01,467
The day will be ours.

134
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:04,423
Understand?

135
00:11:04,598 --> 00:11:06,149
We're leaving Bertholdt to them.

136
00:11:06,228 --> 00:11:07,848
We have to trust they can handle him.

137
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:11,439
As for us, we need to keep Reiner at a safe distance.

138
00:11:12,383 --> 00:11:14,856
Fly just close enough to him to get his attention.

139
00:11:15,332 --> 00:11:16,088
Got it!

140
00:11:23,072 --> 00:11:24,350
He ignored us?

141
00:11:24,954 --> 00:11:25,587
Damn it!

142
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,981
It looks like he's focused on Eren.

143
00:11:28,925 --> 00:11:30,872
Then we'll just have to kill him!

144
00:11:30,944 --> 00:11:31,729
Mikasa!

145
00:11:52,354 --> 00:11:53,100
Hey!

146
00:11:53,433 --> 00:11:55,316
If we can't get Reiner's attention,

147
00:11:55,554 --> 00:11:57,397
we'll have to finish him off right here!

148
00:11:57,881 --> 00:12:00,480
Our job is to protect Eren and Armin!

149
00:12:01,869 --> 00:12:03,260
Yeah. I know that.

150
00:12:03,648 --> 00:12:05,715
We've only got three Thunder Spears.

151
00:12:05,834 --> 00:12:07,326
That's all, but...

152
00:12:07,471 --> 00:12:08,916
We've gotta try anyway!

153
00:12:09,027 --> 00:12:11,228
Because there's no way we're gonna win if we don't fight!

154
00:12:14,151 --> 00:12:15,676
Something hit me.

155
00:12:16,724 --> 00:12:17,353
But what?

156
00:12:17,932 --> 00:12:20,141
A single attack took out my knee.

157
00:12:20,994 --> 00:12:23,330
I can't remember much after that moment.

158
00:12:24,219 --> 00:12:26,395
I'm gonna blow this whole area away.

159
00:12:26,921 --> 00:12:30,409
If you can, lie down with your Titan body facing upwards.

160
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:32,737
Bertholdt.

161
00:12:33,777 --> 00:12:35,025
I'm confused.

162
00:12:35,271 --> 00:12:36,400
What the hell happened to me?

163
00:12:37,304 --> 00:12:38,981
I don't know what's going on.

164
00:12:39,257 --> 00:12:41,514
I don't have much strength left, but...

165
00:12:41,815 --> 00:12:43,961
...I do know Eren's over there.

166
00:12:44,842 --> 00:12:46,603
As long as we capture him,

167
00:12:47,026 --> 00:12:48,951
that means we got what we came for.

168
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:51,573
Right, Bertholdt?

169
00:12:53,114 --> 00:12:57,131
I'll deal with these idiots as quickly
as I can and then head over to back you up.

170
00:12:58,411 --> 00:13:01,462
The four of them who went that way must be after Reiner.

171
00:13:01,936 --> 00:13:07,346
So, the only ones who survived the blast
were the members of the 104th who were with Eren.

172
00:13:08,887 --> 00:13:12,200
Honestly, I was hoping they
would have all died in the blast,

173
00:13:13,295 --> 00:13:13,811
but...

174
00:13:14,233 --> 00:13:16,832
...I'm used to having to fight for what I want, Armin.

175
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:20,494
What's the point of waking Eren
when he's all battered like that?

176
00:13:22,147 --> 00:13:23,958
These are your final moments.

177
00:13:24,267 --> 00:13:26,547
I'm interested to see how you'll spend them.

178
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:31,411
The real question is, how long can I hold out?

179
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,913
It's on me.

180
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:36,583
If I give up too soon, the plan
will fail, no matter how good it is.

181
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:38,832
Hold on.

182
00:13:38,982 --> 00:13:40,777
Armin, are you...?

183
00:13:41,664 --> 00:13:45,918
Sorry, but I can't die till I
get a chance to look at the sea.

184
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:49,510
So I'll have to let go before things get really bad, okay?

185
00:13:50,327 --> 00:13:51,813
The rest will be up to you.

186
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:53,496
No big surprise.

187
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:56,158
I mean, I've never exactly been a hero, so...

188
00:13:56,817 --> 00:13:59,081
No. You're wrong.

189
00:13:59,747 --> 00:14:01,876
You just can't see what I do.

190
00:14:02,233 --> 00:14:04,497
Don't worry. It'll be okay.

191
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:07,753
In all the years we've known
each other, have I ever lied to you?

192
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,663
And I promised that we'd go to the sea together.

193
00:14:15,335 --> 00:14:16,853
So no matter what happens,

194
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:19,337
stick to my plan till the end.

195
00:14:34,553 --> 00:14:35,523
Shit.

196
00:14:44,271 --> 00:14:45,248
Eren!

197
00:14:45,692 --> 00:14:46,646
I knew it.

198
00:14:46,868 --> 00:14:48,862
This battle's already been won.

199
00:14:49,807 --> 00:14:51,953
He probably has a severe concussion.

200
00:14:52,477 --> 00:14:54,775
I doubt he can even stand up on his own.

201
00:14:56,634 --> 00:14:57,826
Enough of this.

202
00:14:58,508 --> 00:14:59,836
Let's end it.

203
00:15:13,254 --> 00:15:14,184
Armin.

204
00:15:14,407 --> 00:15:17,291
You fought well to the very end.

205
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,688
But it's over now.

206
00:15:23,239 --> 00:15:25,164
Eren! Armin!

207
00:15:27,002 --> 00:15:29,162
No. They have their own job.

208
00:15:29,702 --> 00:15:31,378
We need to focus on Reiner.

209
00:15:31,902 --> 00:15:34,921
If we're going to take him out
with just three Thunder Spears,

210
00:15:35,182 --> 00:15:36,502
this is the only way.

211
00:15:37,359 --> 00:15:39,919
We'll initiate the attack while he still can't move.

212
00:15:40,403 --> 00:15:41,706
It might not work.

213
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:44,749
But win or lose, this ends now.

214
00:15:46,624 --> 00:15:47,767
Bring it on.

215
00:15:53,837 --> 00:15:58,404
Reiner!

216
00:15:58,842 --> 00:16:00,603
First, I act as bait.

217
00:16:02,862 --> 00:16:06,104
Conny and Sasha will follow with
two of the remaining Thunder Spears.

218
00:16:06,192 --> 00:16:08,678
and aim for Reiner's jaw from both sides!

219
00:16:16,363 --> 00:16:17,252
Sasha!

220
00:16:17,571 --> 00:16:18,436
Jean!

221
00:16:20,843 --> 00:16:22,003
One of them missed.

222
00:16:24,148 --> 00:16:25,539
If we blow off his jaw,

223
00:16:25,634 --> 00:16:27,678
that should leave Reiner's mouth wide open.

224
00:16:27,837 --> 00:16:32,158
Mikasa should be able to aim the last
Thunder Spear at his nape from inside the mouth.

225
00:16:33,858 --> 00:16:34,811
It's not open.

226
00:16:35,573 --> 00:16:36,424
Doesn't matter.

227
00:16:36,717 --> 00:16:38,481
I have to try anyway.

228
00:16:42,343 --> 00:16:43,630
I don't understand.

229
00:16:44,106 --> 00:16:45,846
How is he still holding on?

230
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:48,405
His anchor should've come loose.

231
00:16:48,626 --> 00:16:50,867
He shouldn't even be able to get this close!

232
00:16:53,177 --> 00:16:54,099
I knew it.

233
00:16:54,459 --> 00:16:56,834
His bones aren't being consumed!

234
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:59,358
The anchors stay put if they're not in muscle!

235
00:16:59,929 --> 00:17:02,712
But most importantly, he's stationary.

236
00:17:02,766 --> 00:17:05,349
He can't move his body while he's emitting steam!

237
00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:07,009
Really, Armin?

238
00:17:07,462 --> 00:17:09,003
This is how you want it to end?

239
00:17:09,512 --> 00:17:10,720
Smart as you are,

240
00:17:10,966 --> 00:17:13,110
this is the best plan you could come up with?

241
00:17:13,872 --> 00:17:15,490
Flailing in midair.

242
00:17:15,591 --> 00:17:17,022
Being scorched to death.

243
00:17:18,498 --> 00:17:20,143
I can't breathe!

244
00:17:20,555 --> 00:17:21,954
I have to let go.

245
00:17:23,098 --> 00:17:26,134
No! Not yet! It's not enough!

246
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:27,975
I have to keep fighting.

247
00:17:28,404 --> 00:17:29,826
Buy more time!

248
00:17:30,787 --> 00:17:32,114
What's the point of this?

249
00:17:32,408 --> 00:17:33,394
A diversion?

250
00:17:33,877 --> 00:17:36,381
But Eren's still collapsed there on the ground.

251
00:17:37,238 --> 00:17:39,976
Mikasa and the others have their hands full with Reiner.

252
00:17:41,099 --> 00:17:43,121
Just a last, desperate act.

253
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:45,159
All right.

254
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:48,125
If this really is the end for you,

255
00:17:48,744 --> 00:17:50,699
I'll do my best to make it quick.

256
00:17:54,902 --> 00:17:56,316
Hold on!

257
00:17:56,629 --> 00:17:57,984
Don't let go!

258
00:17:58,158 --> 00:18:00,224
Entrust it all to Eren.

259
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:02,768
My dreams.

260
00:18:03,395 --> 00:18:04,420
My life.

261
00:18:04,974 --> 00:18:06,003
Everything!

262
00:18:06,469 --> 00:18:10,372
The only thing I have to give is this!

263
00:18:12,048 --> 00:18:13,312
He'll make it.

264
00:18:13,764 --> 00:18:16,353
Someday... Eren...

265
00:18:16,798 --> 00:18:18,364
...will reach the sea.

266
00:18:20,827 --> 00:18:22,272
He'll reach the sea...

267
00:18:23,909 --> 00:18:25,753
...for both of us!

268
00:18:32,776 --> 00:18:35,080
Mikasa! It's too risky!

269
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:37,629
No, it's perfect!

270
00:18:48,144 --> 00:18:49,420
Hange!

271
00:18:51,629 --> 00:18:53,829
Now's your chance! Get him!

272
00:18:58,111 --> 00:18:59,279
No, she can't!

273
00:19:00,231 --> 00:19:01,192
Reiner!

274
00:19:01,731 --> 00:19:03,132
It's over!

275
00:19:17,817 --> 00:19:18,991
It's over.

276
00:19:21,722 --> 00:19:24,409
Now, it's just Eren and the horses.

277
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:31,346
What the?

278
00:19:32,108 --> 00:19:33,553
A hardened Titan?

279
00:19:41,284 --> 00:19:42,389
Gotcha!

280
00:19:57,014 --> 00:19:58,366
It was a diversion!

281
00:19:59,438 --> 00:20:01,941
Eren tricked me into thinking he was out of the fight.

282
00:20:02,711 --> 00:20:04,388
Armin was buying him time,

283
00:20:05,102 --> 00:20:06,882
giving him the chance to harden...

284
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:10,052
to make a replica Titan in his place.

285
00:20:18,649 --> 00:20:22,076
They did it... to make me lower my guard.

286
00:20:22,798 --> 00:20:26,365
So Eren... could sneak up behind me...

287
00:20:26,913 --> 00:20:27,978
...and attack.

288
00:20:54,029 --> 00:20:56,929
In all the years we've known
each other, have I ever lied to you?

289
00:20:59,431 --> 00:21:02,834
Dammit. I should've known how far he'd go.

290
00:21:07,735 --> 00:21:10,365
Hey, why don't you put up a fight?

291
00:21:10,619 --> 00:21:11,269
Huh?

292
00:21:14,034 --> 00:21:16,163
They pick on you 'cause you won't hit back.

293
00:21:16,449 --> 00:21:18,412
You fine with losing forever?

294
00:21:21,025 --> 00:21:21,972
You're wrong.

295
00:21:22,233 --> 00:21:23,673
I'm not losing.

296
00:21:24,439 --> 00:21:25,210
Huh?

297
00:21:27,849 --> 00:21:29,351
Because I don't run.

298
00:21:36,764 --> 00:21:38,837
So, what's your name?

299
00:21:50,413 --> 00:21:53,298
Armin, you are a hero.

300
00:21:56,554 --> 00:21:58,444
You're the bravest of us all.

301
00:23:41,989 --> 00:23:45,108
The remaining Scouts manage to turn back their enemies.

302
00:23:45,696 --> 00:23:49,182
But their victory comes at a heavy price,

303
00:23:49,476 --> 00:23:51,960
leaving them paralyzed with despair.

304
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:55,793
Next episode: "Midnight Sun."
