1
00:00:10,291 --> 00:00:11,708
- ( theme song playing )

2
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:32,458
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,916
- ( car engine revving )

4
00:01:53,916 --> 00:01:57,000
- ( upbeat techno
music playing )

5
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:22,750
- ( chattering indistinctly )

6
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:47,375
- THOSE GUYS'RE KILLIN' IT!

7
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:50,416
- HOLD UP! WHY IS DAIKI'S
EK-NINE DOING THE CHASING?

8
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,208
- MAYBE IT'S CUZ THEY KNEW
THE RACE WOULD BE OVER

9
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:54,541
BEFORE IT STARTED IF HE
WAS OUT IN FRONT.

10
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:58,375
- SO YOU THINK THE GUY'S
JUST SHOWING OFF?

11
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:00,333
- WHOA! TELL YOU ONE THING,

12
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:02,208
THE GUY DRIVING THAT EIGHT-SIX
KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING.

13
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:04,875
- YOU GOT THAT RIGHT. I MEAN,
HE JUST SHOT THROUGH THERE LIKE

14
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:07,000
THIS WAS SOME KINDA
STRAIGHTAWAY.

15
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,416
- Ryosuke: I EXPECTED THAT
DAIKI WOULD WANNA LEAD.

16
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,250
BUT HE CHOSE TO CHASE INSTEAD.

17
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:24,916
AN IMPRESSIVE DECISION,
AND A REALLY SMART ONE.

18
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,208
- HEY, BRO?
- YEAH?

19
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:30,000
- WHEN YOU JUMPED ON THE PHONE
WITH FUJIWARA RIGHT BEFORE THE

20
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:34,000
RACE STARTED, YOU TOLD HIM
SOMETHING. WHAT WAS THE ADVICE?

21
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:36,791
- I WOULDN'T GO SO FAR
AS TO SAY I GAVE HIM ADVICE.

22
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:40,000
I JUST HAD TWO BASIC
INSTRUCTIONS TO GIVE HIM.

23
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:41,958
- AND THEY WERE?

24
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:44,625
- NOT TO LOOK INTO HIS REARVIEW
MIRROR. NO MATTER WHAT, DON'T

25
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:46,916
LOOK INTO IT UNTIL THE
FIRST HEAT IS OVER.

26
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,416
- WAIT, WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

27
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,541
I DON'T SEE HOW THAT WOULD
IMPROVE HIS TIMING IN THE RACE.

28
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:07,916
- DIDN'T SOME IDIOT LAST NIGHT
SPOUT OFF ABOUT RACING OTHER

29
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,375
TEAMS BEING FUN? YEAH, RIGHT,
THEY'VE GOTTA BE KIDDING ME.

30
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:15,375
THIS GUY COULD COMPETE IN A RACE
WITH THE TOUDOU SCHOOL GUYS

31
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:18,500
RIGHT NOW AND GIVE THEM
A REAL RUN FOR THEIR MONEY.

32
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:20,125
WHO THE HELL IS HE?

33
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:29,250
IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

34
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:31,666
I DON'T THINK THERE'S BEEN
ANYONE IN THE TOUDOU SCHOOL'S

35
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,875
HISTORY WHO COULD DRIVE THIS
WELL ON A COURSE AFTER

36
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:37,083
PRACTICING FOR JUST ONE NIGHT.
AND WE'RE THE BEST THERE IS.

37
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:40,875
OF COURSE, I HAVE NO IDEA HOW
MUCH HIS ENGINE'S BEEN TUNED.

38
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:44,541
BUT I KNOW THAT IT REVS JUST AS
HIGH AS MY CARS B16B ENGINE.

39
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:47,125
THE SUCKER CORNERS TIGHTER
THAN AN L BRACKET.

40
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,375
THAT CAR ISN'T AN EIGHT-SIX!

41
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:56,000
DOES THIS MEAN THAT EVEN AN
FR CAN RUN LIKE THIS

42
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:58,041
IF YOU HAVE IT TUNED PROPERLY?

43
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:04,541
YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN ON A
WINNING STREAK BEFORE,

44
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:07,791
USING THAT CAR IN ALL
THOSE "AWAY" RACES.

45
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:10,166
IT LOOKS LIKE YOUR
LUCK HAS RUN OUT.

46
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:14,291
YOUR ONE OUR TURF NOW!

47
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:17,083
THIS IS THE HOME COURSE
THE TOUDOU SCHOOL.

48
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:34,625
- Sakai: I MEAN EVEN THOUGH
HE'S BEEN TRASHING

49
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:36,375
THE GUY'S EIGHT-SIX
THIS WHOLE TIME,

50
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:38,791
HE MUST'VE PUT SOMETHING
TOGETHER IN THAT HEAD OF HIS

51
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:41,875
RIGHT BEFORE THE RACE, BECAUSE
HIS WHOLE ATTITUDE CHANGED.

52
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:45,375
THAT HAD TO BE WHY HE
AGREED TO BE THE CHASER.

53
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:47,291
IF IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
ME IN THAT CAR,

54
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:49,708
I LIKE TO THINK I WOULD HAVE
MADE THE SAME CALL.

55
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:52,750
I'D WANNA SEE HOW THESE GUYS WHO
ARE SUPPOSEDLY THE FASTEST IN

56
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:54,083
GOON-MUH DRIVE.

57
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:56,125
BEST WAY TO DO THAT IS TO
FOLLOW RIGHT BEHIND'EM.

58
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:58,666
AND IF THE DUDE COULDN'T DO ANY
BETTER THAN A HALF-ASSED

59
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,750
PERFORMANCE, I'D JUST
BLOW RIGHT PAST HIM

60
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:02,625
AND PUT A PERIOD ON THE
END OF THE RACE.

61
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:05,083
YOU HAVE A POINT THERE, SAKAI.

62
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:07,125
AND ISN'T DAIKI
SUPPOSED TO BE THE BEST DRIVER

63
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:08,500
AMONG THE CURRENT STUDENTS?

64
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:10,208
WHAT'S HE GOOD AT ANYWAY?

65
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:14,625
- WELL, MAKE OF IT WHAT YOU WILL
BUT DAIKI'S GOOD AT BRAKING.

66
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:17,916
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN, IT MAY NOT
SOUND THAT IMPRESSIVE BUT...

67
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,333
- IT'S ACTUALLY AN
EXCELLENT SKILL TO HAVE.

68
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:23,375
THERE'S NO BETTER WEAPON AT
YOUR DISPOSAL ON THE DOWNHILL.

69
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:26,083
AS A TOUDOU SCHOOL STUDENT

70
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:28,833
YOU SHOULD'VE BEEN TAUGHT
THAT ON DAY ONE.

71
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:52,375
- Ryosuke: IF HE'S GONNA
BE THE ONE CHASING,

72
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:55,375
I WANT YOU TO LISTEN
TO ME VERY CAREFULLY TAKUMI.

73
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:57,125
I DON'T WANT YOU LOOKING
IN THAT REARVIEW

74
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,625
UNTIL THE FIRST RUN IS FINISHED.

75
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:02,416
I WANT YOUR FOCUS ON
MASTERING THE COURSE.

76
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,916
IF YOU DRIVE LIKE YOU
NORMALLY DO,

77
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,375
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE ANY TROUBLE
NOT BEING PASSED.

78
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:11,833
YOU UNDERSTAND? THIS IS VERY
IMPORTANT. DO NOT LOOK BACK.

79
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:20,416
- I THINK I FIGURED OUT WHAT'S
GOING ON WITH THIS EIGHT-SIX.

80
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,875
IT RUNS A WHOLE LOT
BETTER THAN I EXPECTED.

81
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:26,625
BUT I STILL DON'T THINK
IT'S ENOUGH TO WORRY ABOUT.

82
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:28,833
MY SCHOOL'S REPUTATION
IS ON THE LINE.

83
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:31,375
I NEED TO END THIS BEFORE
THE SECOND RUN.

84
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:35,375
BUT THAT MEANS PASSING
HIM SOMEWHERE.

85
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:38,583
I'LL HAVE TO CREATE THE
OPPORTUNITY BY PUSHING HIM.

86
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:41,500
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE HOW LONG
HE CAN HOLD OUT WITH ME!

87
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:47,666
♪ SPEED CAR, SPEED CAR ♪

88
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:53,166
♪ SPEED CAR, SPEED CAR ♪

89
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:59,208
- THEY'RE SO CLOSE!
HOW'RE THEY DOING THIS?

90
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:01,750
- ONE LITTLE HITCH AND BOTH
THOSE DUDES ARE GONNA CRASH!

91
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:04,458
- EVERYONE KNOWS THAT IN THIS
CLASS OF CARS THE FF'S ARE JUST

92
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:07,458
PLAIN FASTER THAN THE FR'S.
BUT ON TOP UH THAT,

93
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:11,041
MY CAR IS THE ULTIMATE,
IT'S THE TYPE R.

94
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:12,541
I CAN'T BE COLLECTING DUST

95
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,916
BEHIND THIS EIGHT-SIX
FOR VERY LONG.

96
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,083
I'M ENDING THIS THING
ON THE FIRST RUN!

97
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:20,125
- TS guy: AS A DRIVER BRAKES
GOING INTO A CORNER,

98
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:23,083
THE MOMENT THAT HE LETS HIS FOOT
UP AND STOPS BRAKING IS WAY MORE

99
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:25,708
IMPORTANT THAN WHEN
HE PUSHES DOWN TO START.

100
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:30,791
THE MOMENTS OF
DECELERATION AND ACCELERATION

101
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:32,375
NEED TO BE PRECISE, CALCULATED.

102
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:36,041
TOO SOON OR TOO LATE AND THEY
CAN BOTH LEAD TO A LOSS OF TIME.

103
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:39,041
A DRIVER WITH A KILLER TECHNIQUE
CAN ALWAYS FIND HIS WAY OUT OF A

104
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:41,916
MISTAKE THAT HE MAKES. BUT ON
ANY GIVEN CORNER, THERE'S ONLY

105
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,625
ONE PERFECT PLACE TO LET OFF OF
THAT BRAKE. EVEN THE BEST

106
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:47,375
DRIVER'S OUT THERE CAN'T RECOVER
FROM SCREWING THAT UP.

107
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:50,041
- YEAH, THAT'S TRUE. CHIEF
ALWAYS SAID BRAKING IS THE MOST

108
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:53,083
DIFFICULT TECHNIQUE TO MASTER
WHEN IT COMES TO DRIVING A CAR.

109
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:55,291
- NO OTHER TECHNIQUE CAN
EVEN COME CLOSE TO IT.

110
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:56,625
- HE'S A SMART MAN.

111
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:58,958
- DAIKI'S EXPERTISE IS IN
DETERMINING JUST WHERE

112
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:00,541
THAT POINT IS IN A CORNER.

113
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:03,833
NO MATTER HOW LONG HE'S HAD HIS
FOOT ON THE BRAKE, HE YANKS IT

114
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:05,333
OFF RIGHT ON THE
MONEY EVERY SINGLE TIME.

115
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:07,375
HE'S NEVER EARLY AND NEVER LATE.

116
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:09,708
HE'S A NATURAL I CAN'T
EXPLAIN IT ANY OTHER WAY.

117
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:11,291
IT'S ALL INSTINCT.

118
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:25,375
- Toudou: LISTEN UP, DAIKI.

119
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:28,250
THESE DAYS ANTILOCK BRAKING
SYSTEMS ARE A STANDARD IN THE

120
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:32,166
RACING WORLD. LET'S YA KNOW HOW
WELL THAT SYSTEM'S GOTTA WORK

121
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,708
FOR EVERYONE TO USE IT.

122
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:40,166
BUT HERE AT THE TOUDOU SCHOOL,

123
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:44,500
WE'VE MADE IT A POINT TO
DITCH IT COMPLETELY. NO ABS.

124
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:46,500
THE FIRST THING YOU GOTTA
LEARN IS HOW TO BREAK

125
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:48,375
WITHOUT RELYING ON
ALL THAT CRAP.

126
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:50,875
YOU CAN'T FIGURE OUT HOW
TO USE THE ABS

127
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:53,375
UNTIL YOU'VE MASTERED THE
BRAKING SYSTEM WITHOUT IT.

128
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:55,833
IT'S YOUR FIRST LESSON. AND I
EXPECT YOU TO LIVE AND BREATHE

129
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:57,916
IT UNTIL YOU'RE BRAKING
IN YOUR SLEEP.

130
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:01,916
IT'S ONE OF THE CHIEF
PRINCIPALS OF MY SCHOOL.

131

CENTER LINE ON THIS ROAD

135
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,500
BUT THE SUCKER IS PLENTY WIDE.

136
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:36,833
I GOT MY PICK UP PLACES WHERE I
CAN PASS THIS GUY. BUT, EVERY

137
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:39,291
TIME I PULL CLOSE USING
MY BRAKING,

138
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:42,375
I MISS MY CHANCE TO
PASS BY A HAIR.

139
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:44,916

142

THAT CLOSE TOGETHER. SERIOUSLY.

143
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,833
- C'MON THEY'RE THAT CLOSE

144
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:04,500
BECAUSE NINOMIYA'S
EK-NINE IS WAY FASTER

145
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:06,875
AND HE'S JUST TRYING TO
GET HIM OUTTA THE WAY.

146
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:09,375
AN EIGHT-SIX IS TOO SLOW
TO BE OUT HERE RACING .

147
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:12,125
- YOU'RE WRONG. I DON'T THINK
IT'S THAT EASY OF AN ANSWER.

148
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:14,541
THERE'S NO WAY YOU COULD
STICK THAT CLOSE TO SOMEONE

149
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:16,375
IF THEY WERE DRIVING SLOW.

150
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:19,166
YOU DON'T STICK SO TIGHTLY TO
SOMEONE'S BUMPER UNLESS YOU HAVE

151
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,125
A LOT OF TRUST IN THE
GUY IN FRONT OF YOU.

152
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:22,958
IF YOU ASK ME, THE DRIVER
OF THAT EIGHT-SIX

153
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:24,375
HAS GOT TO BE INCREDIBLY FAST.

154
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:26,083
- YOU REALLY THINK SO?

155
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:29,208
- YEAH. I'VE NEVER SEEN DAIKI
STICK SO CLOSE TO A BUMPER

156
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:32,625
BEFORE, NOT EVEN DURING A RACE
BETWEEN TOUDOU SCHOOL STUDENTS.

157
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:34,625
GUESS THE GUY WHO
ALWAYS PLAYS IT COOL

158
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:37,000
IS GETTING A LITTLE HOT
UNDER THE COLLAR.

159
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:44,791
- HIS FOCUS ON THE
ROAD IS UNBELIEVABLE.

160
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:46,875
IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW
MUCH I PRESS THIS GUY,

161
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:49,083
I CAN'T GET ANY KIND OF
REACTION OUT OF HIM.

162
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,791
EVEN THE STUDENTS AT SCHOOL
WOULD SHOW SOME KIND OF REACTION

163
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:53,625
IF I WENT THIS FAR
TO PRESSURE THEM.

164
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:01,625
- I DON'T EVEN NEED TO LOOK
INTO MY REARVIEW

165
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:06,208
TO KNOW HE'S BEHIND ME.
AND RIGHT ON MY BUMPER.

166
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:10,375
I CAN FEEL THE PRESSURE AGAINST
MY BACK. IT'S ALMOST PAINFUL.

167
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:13,250
BUT ONCE I MADE UP MY MIND TO
NOT LOOK BACK THERE, IT MADE IT

168
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,458
A WHOLE LOT EASIER TO
CONCENTRATE ON THIS COURSE.

169
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:20,291
RYOSUKE ONLY GAVE ME TWO
SIMPLE INSTRUCTIONS.

170
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:22,416
ALL I HAVE TO DO IS FOLLOW 'EM.

171
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:42,041
- OKAY, BRO. SO, WHAT'S THE
OTHER ONE YOU TOLD HIM?

172
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:43,541
- HMM?

173
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:46,375
- THE OTHER THING YOU TOLD
TAKUMI BEFORE HE WENT OUT THERE.

174
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:47,500
- IT'S REAL SIMPLE.

175
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:51,208
REV-LIMITING.

176
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:55,500
IF YOU DIDN'T KNOW, THAT
EIGHT-SIX OF HIS REVS UP TO

177
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:58,916
ELEVEN THOUSAND RPM'S. BUT I
TOLD HIM TO STAY OFF THE TOP TWO

178
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,708
THOUSAND RPM'S AND
THAT HE SHOULD RESORT

179
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:02,875
TO JUST SHIFTING UP
AT NINE THOUSAND MARK.

180
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:04,375
YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS?

181
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:07,000
WHY WOULD YOU HAVE HIM DO
SOMETHING STUPID LIKE THAT?

182
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:09,750
- BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT HIM
SHOWING ALL OF HIS CAPABILITIES

183
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:12,375
TO HIS OPPONENT RIGHT
OUT OF THE GATE.

184
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,916
AFTER ALL, WE BOTH KNOW
FUJIWARA ISN'T QUITE READY

185
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,291
TO PLAY MIND GAMES JUST YET.

186
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:22,250
IN AN EFFORT NOT TO CLOUD HIS
MIND WITH TOO MUCH CONFUSION AND

187
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:23,750
OVER THINKING, THIS SEEMED
LIKE THE BEST WAY

188
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:26,583
I COULD GET THE RESULTS
THAT I WANTED.

189
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:29,208
I KNOW IT'S SOME RISKY BUSINESS
TO HOLD BACK YOUR ABILITIES

190
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:32,916
AGAINST AN OPPONENT OF THE
CALIBER HE'S GOT TONIGHT.

191
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,833
BUT IF HE MANAGES TO HOLD HIS
OWN AND SURVIVE THE FIRST RUN,

192
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:38,250
THEN I SHOULD BE ABLE TO CREATE
A WINNING SIMULATION.

193
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:41,000
I'M AWARE IT'S AN ENORMOUS
GAMBLE I'M PLACING.

194
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:42,375
- THAT'S RISKY.

195
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:44,833
HE'S STAYING AHEAD OF THE TOUDOU
SCHOOL'S DOWNHILLER.

196
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:47,875
AND HE'S GOT HIS TOP TWO
THOUSAND RPM'S SEALED OFF?

197
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:55,000
WHEN DID HE GET THE SKILLS TO
ATTEMPT SOMETHING LIKE THIS?

198
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:56,458
HE'S ALWAYS HAD IT.

199
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:59,791
THIS GUY CAN ADAPT TO ANY
SITUATION YOU THROW AT HIM.

200
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:17,750
WHAT HE'S TRYING TO DO REQUIRES
A DEGREE OF CONCENTRATION

201
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:19,958
GREATER THAN HE'S
EVER HAD TO USE.

202
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:22,416
- MAKES SENSE. THAT'S
WHY YOU TOLD HIM

203
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,416
TO KEEP HIS EYES OFF HIS
REARVIEW MIRROR.

204
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,958
THAT WAY THERE'S NO CHANCE HE'D
BE AFFECTED BY THE PRESSURE OF

205
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:29,625
HIS OPPONENT BEARING DOWN ON HIM
AND BREAKING HIS FOCUS.

206
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:57,375
- IT'S INCREDIBLE.
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

207
00:14:57,458 --> 00:15:00,208
I NEVER EXPECTED IT TO
BE THIS CRAZY TONIGHT.

208
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:04,416
I MADE A BIG MISTAKE BY
CHASING ON THE FIRST RUN.

209
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,875
EVERY MOVE I MAKE LOOKS LIKE
I'M STRUGGLING BACK HERE.

210
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,958
- ( engine revving )

211
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:31,750
- ALRIGHT, HERE COMES
THE SECOND RUN?

212
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:55,916
- I SAW ENOUGH OF WHAT THE
EIGHT-SIX AND IT'S DRIVER CAN DO

213
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
IN THE FIRST RUN.
I GOT THIS LOCKED DOWN.

214
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:02,041
THEY DON'T HAVE WHAT
IT TAKES TO BEAT ME.

215
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:04,833
THEY JUST DON'T HAVE THE SPEED.
THIS'LL BE OVER IN SECONDS.

216
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:14,875
HE'S FAST!

217
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:28,416
- NOT GOOD.
THIS GUY'S GOT SPEED.

218
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,791
NO ROOM FOR MISTAKES. I'M RIDING
THE RAZOR'S EDGE ON THIS RUN.

219
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:33,833
HE'S GOING AT A PACE
THAT'S A LOT FASTER

220
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:35,416
THAN THE FIRST TIME AROUND.

221
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,333
AM I REALLY GONNA BE ABLE TO
KEEP UP WITH THIS GUY?

222
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:43,583
- WHEN FUJIWARA'S THE
ONE WHO'S CHASING,

223
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:46,166
HE HOLDS A STAGGERING DEGREE
OF CONCENTRATION.

224
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,875
HIS ABILITY TO ADAPT
TO A PACE HE'S

225
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:50,166
NEVER EXPERIENCED BEFORE IS
GREATER THAN SKILL.

226
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:53,375
IT'S MORE LIKE INSTINCT.

227
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:58,291
IF HE'S BEING PULLED ALONG BY A
LOCAL DRIVER WHO'S FASTER THAN

228
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:00,458
HE IS, HE'LL METHODICALLY
MAKE THE OPPONENT'S SPEED

229
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:01,750
INTO HIS OWN.

230
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:11,041
IF THIS WHOLE THING WORKS OUT
LIKE MY SIMULATION SAYS IT WILL,

231
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:13,375
THEN HE SHOULD HAVE
NO PROBLEM BEATING THEM.

232
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:19,458
- I'M COUNTING ON YOU, TAKUMI.
IT'S ALL ON YOU NOW.

233
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:43,375
- WHAT'S HAPPENING?

234
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:45,041
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

235
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:47,875
I SHOULD HAVE FIGURED OUT HIS
TOP SPEED ON THAT FIRST RUN.

236
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:50,750
I KNOW I'M MOVING AT A FASTER
PACE THAN THAT NOW. HE SHOULDN'T

237
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:52,708
BE ABLE TO KEEP UP
WITH ME AT ALL.

238
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:55,250
WHAT ARE YOU STILL
DOING BACK THERE?

239
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,208
- THIS IS STARTING TO SCARE ME.

240
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:02,291
I'VE NEVER KNOWN A DOWNHILL TO
BE THIS FRIGHTENING BEFORE.

241
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:04,083
IF I LET OFF OF THE ACCELERATOR,

242
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:07,416
I CAN RELEASE THIS
FEAR. I KNOW IT.

243
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,083
BUT THERE'S THIS OTHER PART
OF ME THAT'S SAYING

244
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:12,041
"WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T LET GO."

245
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:18,500
- NO WAY.

246
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:24,041
ALL RIGHT. SO ACCORDING TO THE
GUYS AT THE FIRST HAIRPIN TURN,

247
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:26,375
THERE'S NO DISTANCE
BETWEEN THE TWO.

248
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:30,458
WHAT? I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS.
THINK WE GOT A PROBLEM HERE.

249
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:58,708
- I STILL CAN'T SHAKE HIM! HE'S
KEEPING STEADY WITH A PACE

250
00:18:58,791 --> 00:19:01,041
THAT'S TWICE AS FAST
AS OUR FIRST RUN!

251
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:07,375
- IF FUJIWARA CAN KEEP UP, AN
INTERESTING FACTOR WILL EMERGE.

252
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:08,916
IT'LL HAPPEN IN THE SECOND
HALF OF THE COURSE

253
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,833
AND WILL BE AN
ENORMOUS ADVANTAGE.

254
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:13,125
ANY IDEA WHAT THAT
MIGHT BE KENTA?

255
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:16,250
- I MEAN, NO, UH, TO BE HONEST,

256
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:17,666
THE WHOLE THING'S
KINDA CONFUSING.

257
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,375
- WHAT ABOUT YOU?

258
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,416
- I GET THE BASIC GIST
OF WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

259
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,750
IT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AN
FF AND AN FR. IN AN FR,

260
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:27,666
IT'S THE JOB OF THE REAR TIRES
TO DO ALL THE ACCELERATION.

261
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,083
THEY PUSH THE CAR.

262
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:35,000
AN FF OVERUSES THE FRONT TIRES.

263
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:39,125
FOR BOTH ACCELERATION
AND CORNERING.

264
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:42,291
A DOWNHILL RACE BY ITS NATURE IS
ALREADY GONNA PUT STRESS

265
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:44,000
ON THE FRONT TIRES OF A CAR.

266
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:46,083
SO THAT EK-NINE, BEING
A FRONT WHEEL DRIVE,

267
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:48,833
IS GONNA HAVE IT'S FRONT TIRES
GIVE OUT FIRST.

268
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:53,500
- DAMN!

269
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:01,833
THIS IS BAD. I THOUGHT I'D
BEAT HIM IN THE FIRST RUN

270
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:04,791
SO I PUSHED MY CAR WAY TOO HARD.

271
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:07,583
THAT WAS THE BIGGEST MISTAKE
I COULD HAVE MADE!

272
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:10,916
I PUT TOO MUCH
STRESS ON MY TIRES!

273
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,541
- Ryosuke: THIS WHOLE IDEA
OF REV-LIMITING

274
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:14,375
WAS PART OF A
DISTURBANCE TACTIC.

275
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:16,875
A DRIVER WITH ENOUGH SKILLS WILL
BE ABLE TO LEARN EVERYTHING

276
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:19,875
ABOUT HIS OPPONENT'S ABILITIES
SIMPLY BY FOLLOWING BEHIND HIM

277
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:21,291
FOR ENOUGH TIME.

278
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,833
THEN HE'LL DETERMINE NOT ONLY
WHERE TO MAKE HIS PASS,

279
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:25,041
BUT HOW...

280
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:27,208
- SO, THE GUY IN FRONT
WEARS DOWN HIS TIRES

281
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:28,375
AND HIS BRAKES EVEN MORE.

282
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:29,958
- EXACTLY.

283
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:32,208
- THAT'S REALLY AMAZING MAN. I
GUESS I HAD NO IDEA THOSE TWO

284
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:35,375
PIECES OF ADVICE HAD SUCH DEEP
MEANINGS BEHIND THEM.

285
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:37,833
- THE IMPORTANT STUFF
HAPPENS FROM HERE ON OUT.

286
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:39,208
THE TIRES ON THE EIGHT-SIX

287
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:41,041
WON'T LAST FOR MUCH
LONGER EITHER. EVERYTHING NOW

288
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:42,916
IS LEFT UP TO WHETHER
OR NOT TAKUMI

289
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,458
CAN CAPITALIZE ON THAT ADVANTAGE
HE'S BEEN GIVEN.

290
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:50,791
♪ REVOLUTION
WAKE UP THE SLEEPY SAMURAI ♪

291

293
00:20:57,458 --> 00:20:59,375
- I'M NOT IMAGINING
THIS AFTER ALL.

294
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:03,375
HIS CORNERING IS GETTING SLOWER.

295
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:06,291
IS IT HIS TIRES? I WONDER IF
THEY'RE STARTING TO GIVE OUT

296
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:09,041
UNDER THE STRESS. MINE STILL
SEEM TO HAVE PLENTY OF GRIP,

297
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:11,375
BUT WHO KNOWS HOW
LONG THAT'LL LAST.

298
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:17,500
IT'S TIME TO PASS THIS PATHETIC
EK, AND PUT THIS BATTLE TO BED.

299
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:22,666
- IF YOU WERE UP THERE BEHIND
THE WHEEL OF THE EIGHT-SIX,

300
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,416
WHERE WOULD YOU MAKE
THE MOVE TO PASS?

301
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,000
- THERE ARE PLACES ON ANY COURSE
WHERE THE MORE YOU PUSH YOUR

302
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:28,416
CAR, THE MORE DIFFICULT
IT IS TO FIND

303
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,208
THE RIGHT PLACE TO SHIFT GEARS.

304
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:31,791
I'M SURE YOU'VE
EXPERIENCED THIS.

305
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:34,541
I'M TALKING ABOUT THOSE POINTS
LIKE WHERE YOU'RE HEADING INTO A

306
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:35,791
CORNER AND YOU
HESITATE FOR A MOMENT

307
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:38,375
WHILE YOU DECIDED WHETHER
OR NOT TO UPSHIFT.

308
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:40,916
- YEAH, SURE. I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, WHEN THE

309
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,416
TACHOMETER IS IN THE RED ZONE
BUT THERE STILL ISN'T ENOUGH

310
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,166
ROOM LEFT IN FRONT OF
YOU TO SHIFT GEARS

311
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,458
AND ACCELERATE INTO THE TURN.

312
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:49,416
WHEN YOU'RE IN A MOMENT
LIKE THAT, YOU CAN'T DO

313
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:53,291
ANYTHING ELSE BUT WAIT IT OUT.
IT'S SO ANNOYING.

314
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:56,750
TALK ABOUT BEING TIED DOWN.
YOU CAN'T GO FASTER,

315
00:21:56,833 --> 00:22:00,333
YOU CAN'T SLOW DOWN.
YOU'RE JUST SCREWED.

316
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:03,375
- THAT'S IT. THAT'S
WHAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT.

317
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:06,375
I THINK I GET IT, BRO.

318
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:08,375
IT'S ALL IN THE ENGINE
OF THE EIGHT-SIX.

319
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:12,375
IT REV'S HIGHER THAN THE ENGINE
OF THE EK-NINE.

320
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:15,000
THAT'S THE KEY TO
THIS WHOLE THING.

321
00:22:21,458 --> 00:22:24,666
THE WHOLE POINT WAS TO SEAL OFF
HIS TOP TWO THOUSAND RPM'S.

322
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,166
YOU DIDN'T WANT THE GUY FROM
THE TOUDOU SCHOOL

323
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:28,375
TO HAVE ANY IDEA THEY
WERE EVEN THERE.

324
00:22:28,458 --> 00:22:29,916
THAT WAS IT.

325
00:22:33,458 --> 00:22:34,500
- WHAT?

326
00:23:06,875 --> 00:23:10,666
- HE BEAT ME. IT'S OVER.

327
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:13,541
BUT BRAKING IS MY THING, IT'S
WHAT I DO BEST.

328
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:15,416
AND HE STILL PASSED ME!

329
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:48,916
- HEY, MAN
- I LOST. I'M SORRY GUYS.

330
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,166
- ANY IDEA HOW THE
HELL THAT HAPPENED?

331
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:53,916
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'D ACTUALLY
LOSE ON YOUR HOME COURSE.

332
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,458
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

333
00:24:00,458 --> 00:24:02,291
- GOTTA ADMIT, I'M
IMPRESSED, FUJIWARA.

334
00:24:02,375 --> 00:24:05,291
I THINK YOU DID ONE HELLUVA
JOB OUT THERE TONIGHT.

335
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:21,500
- I'M GLAD I DID IT. I MAY HAVE
GOTTEN CAUGHT UP IN THE INSANITY

336
00:24:21,583 --> 00:24:24,625
OF THE MOMENT AND SWEAT BULLETS
WHEN I WAS STRAPPED IN. IT'S NOT

337
00:24:24,708 --> 00:24:28,208
THAT OFTEN I SEE RYOSUKE
LOOKING LIKE THAT. HE'S HAPPY.

338
00:24:28,291 --> 00:24:30,583
I MUST HAVE LIVED UP TO
HIS EXPECTATION THIS TIME.

339
00:24:32,375 --> 00:24:34,041
IT FEELS GOOD.

340
00:24:48,166 --> 00:24:52,500
- DO YOUR BEST OUT THERE,
KEISUKE. I'M PULLING FOR YOU.

341
00:24:52,583 --> 00:24:55,708
- I'M READY. AND I'M GONNA
PUSH IT TO THE LIMIT

342
00:24:55,791 --> 00:24:57,833
ON THE VERY FIRST RUN.

343
00:25:17,458 --> 00:25:18,375
- Fumihiro: ALL RIGHT, GUYS.

344
00:25:18,458 --> 00:25:20,208
WE'RE GONNA START
THE UPHILL NOW!
