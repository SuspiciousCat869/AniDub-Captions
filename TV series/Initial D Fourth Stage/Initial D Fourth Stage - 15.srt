OH, TAKUMI, IT'S YOU.

7
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,791
- HEY, ITSUKI AROUND?
- ACTUALLY, NO.

8
00:01:54,875 --> 00:01:56,500
- YEAH? WHERE IS HE?

9
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:59,625
- HE, UH, TOOK THE DAY OFF AND
HE MIGHT TAKE TOMORROW OFF, TOO.

10
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:02,416
- WHY WOULD HE DO THAT?

11
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,875
- PROBABLY
SHOULDN'T TALK ABOUT IT.

12
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:05,750
BUT ITSUKI MIGHT
HAVE GOTTEN HOSED.

13
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:07,666
HAD SOME PRETTY ROUGH
BUSINESS GO DOWN

14
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,583
WITH THIS GIRL LAST NIGHT.

15
00:02:16,916 --> 00:02:19,541
- WHAT? ARE YOU SERIOUS?
THAT SUCKS.

16
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:21,166
- NOPE. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.

17
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,750
AND FOR HIM TO TAKE
OFF TIME FROM WORK,

18
00:02:22,833 --> 00:02:24,833
IT MUST'VE REALLY STUNG.

19
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:28,541
- OH, MAN. I NEVER THOUGHT
SHE WOULD'VE DONE THAT TO HIM.

20
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:30,916
- LOVE TRIANGLES LIKE THAT
HAPPEN ALL THE TIME,

21
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,958
IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S ALWAYS
A LOSER. IT JUST BLOWS THIS TIME

22
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:36,083
'CAUSE ITSUKI THOUGHT
HE WAS GOLDEN WITH HER.

23
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:37,875
- IN THE END, I THINK
KAZUMI MADE THE CALL

24
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:40,125
BASED ON WHAT SHE
SAW AS EXPERIENCE.

25
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:42,875
OR ITSUKI'S LACK OF IT,
TO BE BLUNT.

26
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:44,166
- I GUESS YOU SHOULD KNOW.

27
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,500
WASN'T IT THE SAME STORY
BETWEEN YOU AND macho?

28
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,625
I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD
BE POINTING ANY FINGERS.

29
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:50,916
- WELL, NEITHER ARE YOU.
SO SHUT UP.

30
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,666
MY HEART STILL ACHES FROM
THE WHOLE THING.

31
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,166
- HEY, WOULD YOU MIND
GIVING ITSUKI A RING LATER

32
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,916
AND SEEING IF HE'S
FEELING ANY BETTER?

33
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,416
- YEAH, I'LL MAKE SURE
TO DO THAT.

34
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,958
BUT I SUCK AT THAT KINDA THING.

35
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:02,541
I NEVER KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

36
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:05,375
- IT'D PROBABLY BE BEST IF YOU
GUYS LEFT THE POOR FOOL ALONE.

37
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:07,916
NOW, LISTEN, IF ITSUKI DOES
SHOW FOR WORK TOMORROW,

38
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,416
I DON'T WANT ANY OF YOU

39
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,750
EVEN MENTIONING THIS BUSINESS
ABOUT HIM GETTING DUMPED.

40
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:13,041
ARE WE CLEAR ON THAT?

41
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:15,375
- CRYSTAL.
- WHATEVER YOU SAY, BOSS.

42
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:17,083
- ( car approaching )

43
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:27,041
- GO AHEAD AND FILL HER UP WITH
HIGH OCTANE, AND MAKE IT FAST.

44
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:29,291
- Iketani: YES, SIR. NO PROBLEM.
COMING RIGHT UP.

45
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:36,125
- HEY, MAN. ABOUT LAST NIGHT...

46
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:38,666
- HOLD THAT THOUGHT, TAKUMI,
I'M GLAD I FOUND YOU.

47
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,833
THERE'S A LITTLE SOMETHING
I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

48
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:42,291
- YOU CAME HERE TO TALK TO ME?

49
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:57,583
- LOOK FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,

50
00:03:57,666 --> 00:04:00,375
I FEEL BAD ABOUT WHAT WENT
DOWN WITH ITSUKI.

51
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:02,958
WOULD YOU DO ME A FAVOR
AND TELL HIM SOMETHING FOR ME?

52
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:04,500
TELL HIM I SAID HE NEEDS
TO FORGET

53
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:06,083
ALL ABOUT MY LITTLE SISTER

54
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:09,083
AND FIND HIMSELF A NICE GIRL.
ONE THAT WILL TREAT HIM RIGHT.

55
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,083
- SO, THIS IS WHAT A
SUPERCHARGER FEELS LIKE

56
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:25,500
FROM THE INSIDE.

57
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:27,875
MAN, IT'S A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT
FEEL FROM MY EIGHT-SIX.

58
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:29,791
- I CLOCKED IN OVER
TWO HUNDRED HORSEPOWER

59
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:31,666
LAST TIME I PUT IT
ON THE CHASSIS DYNAMO.

60
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,583
BUT WHEN I TAKE HER OUT
ON A HIGH-SPEED UPHILL

61
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:34,958
LIKE MT. AKINA,

62
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,208
YOU CAN'T TELL THERE'S A
SUPERCHARGER UNDER THE HOOD.

63
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:39,333
IT TAKES TIGHT PASSES
LIKE THE ONES IN CHICHIBU

64
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:41,291
FOR YOU TO REALLY SEE WHAT
KIND OF A BOOST IT GETS.

65
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:54,375
- WELL, YOU'VE BEATEN
THE NORTHERN SAITAMA ALLIANCE.

66
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:56,291
AND NOW THAT YOU'VE
STOMPED US INTO THE GROUND,

67
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:58,583
YOUR RUNNING OUT OF CHALLENGES
HERE IN SAITAMA.

68
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,375
BUT IF YOU REALLY WANT TO DOT
THE I'S ON YOUR TRIP HERE,

69
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:05,291
THERE'S ON MORE GROUP YOU MIGHT
WANNA PUT YOUR SIGHTS ON.

70
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:10,166
I'M WARNING YOU, THEY'RE
A SHADY BUNCH OF PRICKS.

71
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,875
BUT JUST TALKING
ABOUT THEIR SKILL LEVEL,

72
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:13,708
THEY SHOULDN'T GIVE YOU
A WHOLE LOT OF TROUBLE.

73
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,958
- SO...
- HUH?

74
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:20,875
- LOOK, THERE'S SOMETHING
THAT I'VE BEEN WANTING

75
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:22,625
TO ASK YOU FOR A WHILE NOW.

76
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:25,250
I WAS CURIOUS IF YOU EVER
FELT LIKE YOU WERE KINDA BEING

77
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,541
HELD BACK BY THE EIGHT-SIX'S
LIMITED CAPABILITIES.

78
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:30,333
- HUH? WELL, YEAH, DUDE,
OF COURSE I DO.

79
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:31,583
I MEAN, WHY WOULDN'T I?

80
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:33,291
WHY ELSE DO YOU THINK
I JACK IT UP WITH THINGS

81
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,166
LIKE THE SUPERCHARGER
AND THE TURBO?

82
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,791
I MESS WITH IT
ALL THE TIME, MAN.

83
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:39,541
EVEN IN THE RAIN
THE OTHER NIGHT,

84
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:41,250
I CAUGHT MYSELF WISHING
THAT THE LEVIN'S BODY

85
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:42,625
WAS A LITTLE LIGHTER,

86
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:46,333
MORE UPDATED. STARTED
TO WEAR ON ME AFTER A WHILE.

87
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:48,500
TO BE HONEST I'M SURPRISED
TO HEAR THAT YOU'VE HAD

88
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:50,458
THE SAME CONCERNS ABOUT
IT, YOU KNOW.

89
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:52,000
I GUESS I SORT OF
THOUGHT THAT YOU WERE

90
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:54,291
ABOVE IT OR SOMETHING,
I DON'T KNOW.

91
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:56,875
I MEAN YOU'VE GONE UP AGAINST
ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT CARS

92
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:58,833
IN THE EIGHT-SIX,
AND YOU HAVEN'T LOST YET.

93
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:00,625
- OKAY, I HAVEN'T
TOLD ANYONE THIS,

94
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:02,583
BUT SOMETHING HAPPENED
THE OTHER NIGHT.

95
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:06,125
- I SORT OF GOT PASSED
ON MY HOME COURSE.

96
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:07,208
- HUH?

97
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:14,916
- ( sighs )

98
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I HAVE A HARD TIME
BELIEVING THAT.

99
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:21,166
YOU KNOW THE PASS LIKE THE BACK
OF YOUR HAND. I'VE SEEN YOU.

100
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:24,166
- WHAT KINDA CAR WAS IT?
- A SUBARU IMPREZA.

101
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,333
- MAKES SENSE,
THAT'S A FOUR WHEEL DRIVE.

102
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:29,541
- I'VE BEEN FEELING REALLY WEIRD
ABOUT IT EVER SINCE IT HAPPENED.

103
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:30,916
IT'S LIKE I'VE WORKED MYSELF UP

104
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,916
INTO SOME KIND OF FOUR-WHEEL
DRIVE ANXIETY COMPLEX.

105
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,750
- MAYBE SO.

106
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:37,583
BUT REMEMBER YOU'VE GONE
UP AGAINST A LAN EVO

107
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:38,541
BEFORE AND YOU'VE WON.

108
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:40,041
DON'T FOCUS SO MUCH ATTENTION

109
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:41,416
ON THE FACT THAT IT'S
A FOUR-WHEEL DRIVE

110
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,000
IT'LL ONLY SCREW YOU UP.

111
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:46,000
- I KNOW AND I'M TRYING NOT TO
BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM TO HELP.

112
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:47,250
- ( tires screeching )

113
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:54,916
- I KNOW IT SHOULDN'T HAVE
SHAKEN ME UP SO BAD, BUT IT DID.

114
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,750
SO, IF THERE IS ANY ADVICE
YOU COULD GIVE ME,

115
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,250
I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

116
00:06:58,333 --> 00:06:59,875
- DAMN, DUDE I DON'T KNOW.

117
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:05,000
- I'VE HAD TO DEAL WITH
THE LIMIT'S OF THE EIGHT-SIX

118
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:07,166
MORE TIMES THAN
I'D LIKE TO ADMIT.

119
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,208
BUT WHEN YOU REALLY BREAK
IT DOWN, IT DOESN'T MATTER

120
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:11,041
IF YOU'RE GOING UP
AGAINST A FOUR-WHEEL DRIVE,

121
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:12,958
AN FF, AN FR, OR WHAT.

122
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:14,625
ALL NEW CARS ARE SCARY.

123
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:16,333
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
ALL OF THEM?

124
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:18,791
- NOTHING WRONG WITH A LITTLE
BIT OF FEAR AS LONG AS YOU USE

125
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:20,125
IT TO YOUR ADVANTAGE.

126
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:22,750
I WORKED MY ASS OFF TO IMPROVE
ON MY OWN SKILLS,

127
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:24,875
TRYING TO MAKE UP FOR
THE WEAKNESSES OF THE CAR.

128
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:29,625
ALL RIGHT, I THINK I KNOW
SOMETHING THAT MIGHT BE USEFUL.

129
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:31,583
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'LL HELP YOU
WITH YOUR COMPLEX

130
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:33,375
BUT IT SURE AS HELL
HELPED ME GET OVER MINE.

131
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:34,916
YOU DON'T KNOW IT YET,

132
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,875
BUT YOUR NEXT OPPONENT WILL
PROBABLY BE A FOUR-WHEEL DRIVE.

133
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:41,291
UP UNTIL LAST YEAR, YOU WERE
ABLE TO KEEP KNOCKING OUT WINS

134
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:44,541
WITH NO KNOWLEDGE OR INFORMATION
OR ANY BACKGROUND IN THIS STUFF.

135
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:46,500
BUT NO MATTER HOW GOOD
A DRIVER YOU ARE,

136
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:48,875
AT SOME POINT YOUR GOING
TO HIT A WALL.

137
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:51,166
BEFORE NOW YOU'VE BEATEN
FOUR-WHEEL DRIVES

138
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,833
BY GOING AS HARD
AS YOU KNOW HOW,

139
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:55,416
NOT BY UNDERSTANDING
YOUR OPPONENTS.

140
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,833
THAT'S THE DEFINITION
OF A CLUELESS VICTORY.

141
00:07:57,916 --> 00:08:00,666
BUT I THINK YOU'RE STILL
ATTACKING THE PROBLEMS

142
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,833
OF THE EIGHT-SIX
IN THE RIGHT WAY.

143
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:04,833
SO, JUST DEAL
WITH THE FOUR-WHEEL DRIVE

144
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:07,541
LIKE YOU TACKLE ANY OTHER
CAR YOU'RE FACING.

145
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:09,250
KNOW THEIR ADVANTAGES

146
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:12,708
AND EXPLOIT THE HELL OUT
OF THEIR WEAKNESSES.

147
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:15,416
IF YOU WANT TO KEEP
WINNING, GET CREATIVE.

148
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,083
YOUR UPCOMING BATTLE
WILL BE THE PERFECT CHANCE.

149
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:20,500
TRY TO PUT SOME SERIOUS
BRAIN POWER ON IT

150
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:24,000
AND FIGURE OUT A WAY
TO DEFEAT THE FOUR-WHEEL DRIVES.

151
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:25,875
- TELL ME SOMETHING
I DON'T KNOW?

152
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:28,041
BUT HOW AM I GOING TO DO THAT?

153
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:30,208
- 'COURSE IT GETS PRETTY BORING
IF YOU ALWAYS KNOW

154
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:32,541
WHAT TO EXPECT, SO
DON'T GO OVERBOARD.

155
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:34,291
YOUR NATURAL CLUELESSNESS

156
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:37,500
IS WHAT MAKES YOU A UNIQUE
PACKAGE, TAKUMI.

157
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:47,041
- STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES
OF A FOUR-WHEEL DRIVE, HUH?

158
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,500
WATARU WAS RIGHT.

159
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:55,291
LAST YEAR I WAS DRIVING MY
HARDEST WITHOUT KNOWING

160
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:56,666
A THING. ON A SCALE
OF ONE TO TEN,

161
00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:00,000
MY IGNORANCE WAS AT
A NINE POINT FIVE.

162
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:02,250
'COURSE NOW I KNOW
MORE ABOUT FOUR-WHEEL DRIVES

163
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,625
THAN I EVER WANTED TO.

164
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:06,458
I'M NOT SURE THOUGH. I
DON'T THINK THIS IS

165
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:08,750
AS SIMPLE AS HE MAKING IT SOUND.

166
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:12,708
MAN, IF THIS THING HAS
A WEAKNESS,

167
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:14,708
I HAVE NO CLUE WHAT IT IS?

168
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:30,750
- Kuro: WHAT DO YOU
WANNA TALK ABOUT?

169
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:32,333
- Shiro: OKAY,
KEEP THIS BETWEEN US,

170
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:34,333
BUT IF WE WIN THIS NEXT BATTLE
WE GOT COMING UP,

171
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:35,958
I THINK WE CAN
MAKE SOME CASH OFF IT.

172
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:37,708
- HUH?

173
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:41,000
- LOOK, PROJECT D
IS PRETTY FAMOUS, RIGHT?

174
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:44,041
SO SAY OUR EVO'S WIN THIS RACE
WE GOT WITH THEM.

175
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,791
THAT WOULD SO BOOST SALES FOR
THE SHOP THAT HELPS US OUT.

176
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:48,625
AND IF THEY POST THIS WIN
ALL OVER THE NET,

177
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:50,583
YOU KNOW THEY'LL START
GETTING HIT'S FROM ALL OVER.

178
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:53,000
SERIOUSLY, TELL ME THAT WOULDN'T
BRING IN THE CUSTOMERS

179
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:54,708
FOR THOSE GREASE MONKEYS.

180
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:56,416
- I SEE WHAT YOU'RE GETTING AT.

181
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,958
SO, HOW MUCH DO YOU
THINK WE CAN GET?

182
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:01,166
- WIN BOTH RACES,
FIVE HUNDRED THOU.

183
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,583
ONE RACE, TWO HUNDRED
AND FIFTY THOU.

184
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:06,500
WE TIE, I WORKED IT OUT SO
THAT WE STILL GET FIFTY GRAND.

185
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:09,250
- COOL, YOU GOT TO BE
SHITTING ME.

186
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:10,500
- NOPE.

187
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:13,583
- A WIN AGAINST THESE GUYS
WON'T BE SO EASY.

188
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:15,625
- BUT I GOT NO INTENTIONS
OF RUNNING A FAIR RACE

189
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:16,916
TO BEGIN WITH.

190
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,166
IT DOESN'T MATTER
IF WE CHEAT.

191
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,958
ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS GET
'EM THE RESULTS,

192
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:22,875
THEY GET US THE CASH
AND WE'RE HOME FREE.

193
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:24,583
AND IF I KNOW ANYBODY
THAT CAN CHEAT LIKE A PRO,

194
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:25,958
KURO, MY MAN, IT'S YOU.

195
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:27,291
- ( chuckles )

196
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:29,250
I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE
MUCH ROOM TO TALK, SHIRO.

197
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,791
- THERE THEY GO.

198
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,916
- WATARU SAID WE'D BE UP
AGAINST FOUR-WHEEL DRIVES NEXT.

199
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,958
AND SURE ENOUGH
THESE GUYS DRIVE LAN EVOS.

200
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:18,541
- Kuro: NO WAY?

201
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:20,958
- HEY, RYOSUKE, WE NEED
TO SEE YOU OVER HERE.

202
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:25,375
THESE GUYS HAVE
A REQUEST TO MAKE.

203
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:26,833
THEY'RE SAYING
THEY WANNA SPLIT UP

204
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:28,125
THE PRACTICE TIME
BETWEEN OUR TEAMS.

205
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:29,833
I FIGURED YOU MIGHT
WANT TO WEIGH IN.

206
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:30,958
IT'S NOT HOW WE'VE
DONE IT BEFORE.

207
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:32,500
COULD THROW US OFF OUR GAME.

208
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:33,875
WHAT DO YOU THINK
WE SHOULD DO?

209
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:36,875
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY
WE HAVE TO SPLIT THE TIME.

210
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:38,458
CAN'T WE JUST PRACTICE TOGETHER?

211
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:41,083
- I DON'T THINK WE'D FEEL
VERY COMFORTABLE DOING THAT.

212
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:43,958
YOU SEE THE THING IS,
WE DON'T LIKE PRACTICING

213
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:47,000
WITH PEOPLE WHOSE SKILLS WE'RE
NOT TOO SURE OF, YOU UNDERSTAND.

214
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,333
I GOT NO IDEA
HOW YOU GUYS DRIVE.

215
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:54,500
LOOK, I JUST DON'T WANT TO SEE
YOU TAKE A CORNER TOO WIDE

216
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:56,583
AND WIPE ME OUT
DURING A PRACTICE RUN.

217
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:59,083
- YOU GOT TRUST ISSUES, PAL,
OR ARE YOU TRYING TO BE A DICK?

218
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:01,291
- JUST STAY OUT OF THIS, YOU'RE
ONLY GOING TO MAKE THINGS WORSE?

219
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:02,750
- THIS IS SCREWED UP.

220
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:05,208
- DON'T GET BENT OUT OF SHAPE.
ALL I'M SAYING IS THIS,

221
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:09,375
WE SPLIT OUR PRACTICE TIME
EVENLY UNTIL THE SUN COMES UP.

222
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:12,208
C'MON, GUYS,
WHAT'S WITH THE ATTITUDE?

223
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:13,333
I MEAN IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT,

224
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:15,250
WE CAN JUST FORGET
THIS WHOLE THING.

225
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:17,375
IT'S NOT LIKE WE GOT ANY REASON
TO GO OUT OF OUR WAY

226
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:18,458
TO RACE YOU, GUYS.

227
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:20,000
WE GOT NOTHING TO PROVE.

228
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:24,083
- SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN.

229
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:25,500
- ARE YOU SURE YOU
WANT TO DO THIS?

230
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:28,708
- BRO, WAIT.
- NO. THE DECISION IS MADE.

231
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:46,041
- WHY ARE WE TRYING TO
PRETEND THAT THIS IS FAIR?

232
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:47,541
IT'S A BAD FREAKING JOKE.

233
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:49,750
I MEAN, GIVE ME A BREAK.
THEY'RE THE DAMN LOCALS.

234
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:51,333
THEY DRIVE THIS
COURSE EVERY DAY.

235
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:53,250
ALL THIS COMES DOWN TO IS
THEM NOT WANTING US

236
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:54,958
TO GET ENOUGH
PRACTICE TIME IN.

237
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:57,291
- I NEVER DEALT WITH
JERKS LIKE THIS BEFORE.

238
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:58,708
MAN, THEY PISS ME OFF.

239
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:01,208
- UP UNTIL TONIGHT, WE'VE ONLY
GONE UP AGAINST GUYS

240
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:02,708
WHO MAY HAVE HAD A PLAN
UP THEIR SLEEVE,

241
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:05,000
BUT DAMN IT, IF THAT PLAN WASN'T
AT LEAST CLEAN AND FAIR.

242
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:07,083
THESE IDIOTS THINK
THAT THEY CAN TRIP US UP

243
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:08,666
BY CUTTING OUR PRACTICE
TIME IN HALF.

244
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,416
BUT IT'LL JUST MAKE IT
JUST THAT MUCH MORE

245
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,875
EMBARRASSING WHEN THEY LOSE.

246
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:14,083
TOMORROW, THEY'RE GONNA SEE
EXACTLY THE KIND OF IDIOTS

247
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:15,958
PROJECT D CAN MAKE 'EM.

248
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:17,666
- YOU KNOW I WAS THINKING
THIS MIGHT BE THE EXACTLY

249
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,125
THE KIND OF CHALLENGE
TAKUMI NEEDS

250
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:21,625
TO REALLY MOVE HIM UP TO
THE NEXT LEVEL AS A DRIVER.

251
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:23,708
HE'LL HAVE TO SET UP HIS CAR
AND MASTER THIS COURSE

252
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:24,916
IN ABOUT HALF THE TIME

253
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,416
HE USUALLY HAS TO DO
THE SAME AMOUNT OF WORK,

254
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,083
THAT'S A MAJOR SWITCH.

255
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:30,541
- YEAH, I'VE GOT A BAD FEELING
ABOUT THESE GUYS,

256
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:32,750
THAT THEY MAY BE TRYING
TO PULL SOME KIND OF SCAM.

257
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:34,125
- YEAH, WHAT KIND?

258
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:36,291
- I'M NOT SURE.

259
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:39,041
BUT UNTIL I AM, I WANT
YOU TO KEEP YOUR GUARD UP.

260
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:00,458
- YOU WON'T HAVE MUCH TIME,
SO SCORCH THE WHOLE COURSE

261
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:02,416
AND THE ROAD CONDITIONS
INTO YOUR MIND. GOT IT?

262
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:07,541
- IT'S ABOUT DAMN TIME. WE CAN
FINALLY GET OUT THERE

263
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:09,791
AND START LEARNING THIS ROAD.

264
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:13,291
HEY, REALLY TRY TO GET SOME
WORK IN BEFORE THE SUN COMES UP.

265
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:14,708
NO SLAKING OUT THERE.

266
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:20,750
- STANDING BY, I'M READY
WHENEVER YOU ARE KEISUKE.

267
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:22,000
- OKAY.

268
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:24,583
- ( tires screeching )

269
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:28,041
- ♪ GIVE ME LOVE ♪

270
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:34,791
♪ GIVE ME LOVE ♪

271
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:40,916
- WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME.

272
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,958
WE NEED TO BE AS
EFFICIENT AS WE CAN.

273
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:44,791
- THEN, LET'S GET THIS
SHOW ON THE ROAD.

274
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,125
- YOUR PUNK ASSES WON'T BE ABLE

275
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:58,333
TO STAY SO COCKY
FOR MUCH LONGER.

276
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:00,416
I THINK OUR BEST SHOT
AT PULLING OUT THIS WIN

277
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,500
IS TO PUT OUR SIGHTS

278
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:03,500
ON THE FD INSTEAD
OF THE EIGHT-SIX.

279
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:06,541
- OH, I GET IT. YOU WANT
THE EASY WIN FOR YOURSELF, HUH?

280
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:09,916
- SHUT UP, MAN, THAT'S NOT IT.
I JUST THINK THAT THE FREAK

281
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,916
DRIVING THE FD NEEDS
A GOOD PUBLIC BITCH SLAP.

282
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,750
GUY HAD THE NERVE TO STARE
ME DOWN LIKE A CHUMP.

283
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:17,333
I'M GONNA MAKE THAT PUNK CRY

284
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:20,208
IN FRONT OF ALL HIS
LITTLE FREAK FRIENDS.

285
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:22,500
- YEAH, COOL,
WHATEVER YOU SAY, MAN.

286
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:25,875
RUN YOU RACE HOWEVER YOU WANT,
I STILL GET HALF THE CASH?

287
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:28,291
- ( cellphone dialing )

288
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:31,583
- HEY, IT'S ME. I NEED YOU
TO LISTEN UP, I'VE GOT INFO.

289
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,541
OUR TARGET'S GONNA BE THE FD.

290
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:41,208
- HEY. SO, ARE YOU SURE
ABOUT THIS MAN?

291
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:43,000
THEY'LL KILL US IF
THEY CATCH US.

292
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:44,708
- YOU LET ME WORRY ABOUT THAT.

293
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:46,541
- OKAY. BUT I DON'T KNOW
IF I'M GOING TO BE ABLE

294
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:47,958
TO HIT THE TIMING JUST RIGHT.

295
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:49,708
I MAKE ONE MISTAKE AND I WILL
END UP HITTING THEM BOTH

296
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:51,958
AND NONE OF US WANTS TO SEE
WHAT THAT WRECK WILL LOOK LIKE.

297
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:53,708
- HEY, IF IT HAPPENS,
IT HAPPENS.

298
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:55,083
( laughs )

299
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:59,416
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS,
HE SAYS WE TARGET THE FD.

300
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,291
- ( No Control playing )

301

308

- ONLY HAVING HALF THE TIME
TO RUN THE COURSE SUCKS BAD.

309
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:32,250
I DON'T EVEN HAVE THE TIME
TO THINK ABOUT

310
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:34,083
BEATING THE
FOUR-WHEEL DRIVE.

311
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:36,458
ALL I CAN REALLY FOCUS ON
IS BEATING THE COURSE.

312
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:39,583
I'M GETTING BOUNCED
ALL OVER THE PLACE.

313
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:42,333
AND I GOTTA HAVE EVER POINT
WHERE THE CAR JUMPS MEMORIZED.

314
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:48,583
- IT MAY BE THE SMOOTHEST
SURFACE I'VE EVER DRIVEN ON,

315
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:51,000

322
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:11,625
- I LOVE THE PRACTICE RUNS.
EVERY TIME I PASS HIM,

323
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:14,333
I GET TO REMIND MYSELF THAT
I'M NEVER GONNA LOSE TO HIM.

324
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:26,791
MY FD IS FEELING
SOLID TONIGHT.

325
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:28,250
IF EVERYTHING KEEPS
UP LIKE THIS,

326
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:30,166
WE'LL HAVE THIS THING
WRAPPED UP EARLY.

327
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,791
I'LL RUN A PERFECT COURSE.

328
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:44,875
WHAT'S THAT ON THE ROAD.
IS THAT WATER?

329
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:47,708
IT WASN'T THERE WHEN
I PASSED EARLIER.

330
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:49,875
THAT'S NOT WATER. THAT'S OIL.

331
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:04,416
( Keisuke panting )

332
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,291
- DUDE, ARE YOU OKAY?

333
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:18,750
- ( on phone) YEAH, FUMIHIRO.
THIS IS KEISUKE.

334
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:20,458
- HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON, MAN?
YOU SOUND WEIRD.

335
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:22,208
- HELL, YEAH.
THOSE GUYS STILL THERE?

336
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:24,250
- WHAT, YOU MEAN THE GUYS THAT
WE'RE GOING UP AGAINST TOMORROW?

337
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:27,333
NO, NOT ANYMORE. THEY BLEW
OUT OF HERE A LITTLE WHILE AGO.

338
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:29,000
WHY? IS SOMETHING WRONG?

339
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:30,875
- YES, LISTEN,
IT'S AN EMERGENCY.

340
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:32,666
STOP THE EIGHT-SIX RIGHT NOW.

341
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,541
DON'T LET HIM COME BACK
MY WAY. YOU GOT ME?

342
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:37,666
- DUDE, SLOW DOWN WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT? WHAT HAPPENED?

343
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:40,458
- SOMEBODY DUMPED A FEW
GALLONS OF OIL ACROSS THE ROAD.

344
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:43,125
- YOU'RE KIDDING ME? WHERE ARE
YOU NOW? ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

345
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:45,416
HOW'S YOUR CAR?
IS MIYAGUCHI STILL WITH YOU?

346
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,250
- I'M OKAY BUT I GOT
SOME BAD NEWS, GUYS.

347
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:52,083
MY FD... SHE'S ALL BUSTED UP.

348
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:03,250
- WELL, IT'S NOT LIKE YOU COULD
HAVE AVOIDED THIS, KEISUKE,

349
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:04,791
NOBODY COULD.

350
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:07,541
- DAMN, THIS SUCKS,
WHO WOULD'VE DONE THIS?

351
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:08,708
- ISN'T IT OBVIOUS, MAN?

352
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:10,500
WHO ELSE WOULD WANT TO
SCREW UP MY RIDE?

353
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:12,750
- WHOEVER DID THIS
HAD AN ESCAPE ROUTE.

354
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:16,083
THEY MUST HAVE LEFT DOWN
THAT ROAD IT'S THE ONLY WAY.

355
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:18,958
ON THE MAP, IT LOOKS LIKE
IT'S WIDE ENOUGH FOR ONE CAR.

356
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:21,541
GOES ALL THE WAY
TO THE NEXT TOWN.

357
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:23,375
- IF SO, THEN WHY
DON'T WE GET A MOVE ON

358
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:25,458
AND TRY TO BEAT THEM
TO THE EXIT ON THE OTHER END?

359
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:27,375
WE SHOULD HAVE ENOUGH TIME
TO CATCH THEIR PUNK ASSES

360
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:28,916
WHEN THEY COME
SLITHERING OUT.

361
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,041
THAT'S WHERE I'M GOING.
I'M TAKING UNIT ONE.

362
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:32,916
- HEY, HOLD UP, KEISUKE.
I'M GOING WITH YOU.

363
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,083
- CUT IT OUT, YOU TWO.

364
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:35,833
THERE'S NO POINT IN YOU
CHASING THEM DOWN.

365
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:37,208
- YEAH, THERE IS.

366
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:39,166
NOBODY DOES THAT TO MY BABY
AND GETS AWAY WITH IT.

367
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,708
MESS WITH ANOTHER DUDE'S CAR
AND YOU'RE GONNA PAY FOR IT.

368
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:43,291
THEY SHOULD KNOW THAT
AND IF THEY DON'T,

369
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:45,166
I'M GONNA HUNT THEM DOWN
AND TEACH IT TO THEM.

370
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,458
- DON'T MAKE ME REPEAT
MYSELF, KEISUKE,

371
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:49,583
I TOLD YOU TO CALM DOWN.

372
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:56,125
- Fumihiro: HOW BAD IS IT?
- Miyaguchi: IT'S PRETTY BAD.

373
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:58,958
LOOKS LIKE THE SUSPENSION ARM
IS ALL KINDS OF JACKED UP.

374
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:00,416
AND WITH THIS HARD
OF AN IMPACT,

375
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,875
THE ALIGNMENT PROBABLY
NEEDS TO BE COMPLETELY RESET.

376
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:05,208
THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO WAY
WE CAN HAVE THIS SUCKER READY

377
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:06,791
BY TOMORROW NIGHT.

378
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:09,166
- BUT THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH THE DRIVETRAIN, IS THERE?

379
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,375
JUST FIX IT UP TO WHERE
I CAN DRIVE AGAIN.

380
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:13,166
JERRY-RIGGING IF YOU
HAVE TO, ALL RIGHT?

381
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:14,916
I DON'T EVEN CARE IF SHE WON'T
DRIVE STRAIGHT.

382
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,833
LET ME DEAL WITH THE REST
OF IT ON THE COURSE.

383
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:19,000
- ARE YOU EVEN LISTENING
TO YOURSELF, KEISUKE.

384
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:21,041
YOU HAVE TO ADMIT THAT YOU
AREN'T THE MOST CAUTIOUS DRIVER

385
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:22,375
IN THE WORLD

386
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:23,250
AND WITH THE SUSPENSION
IN THE SHAPE THAT IT'S IN,

387
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:24,375
YOUR GOING TO KILL YOURSELF.

388
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:25,708
- FUMIHIRO IS RIGHT.

389
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:27,375
YOU REALLY CAN'T PREDICT HOW
THE CAR IS GONNA ACT

390
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:28,875
WHEN IT'S LIKE THIS.

391
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:31,625
AND YOUR LIMIT'S OUT THERE ARE
GOING TO BE EXTREMELY LOW.

392
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:32,875
SORRY, MAN.

393
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:34,416
YOU'RE JUST NOT GONNA BE
WORTH MUCH IN A BATTLE.

394
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,083
- ( engine revs )

395
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,333
- HERE YOU GUYS ARE.

396
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:45,583
AND I WONDERED WHY IT'S SO
QUIET UP ON THE MOUNTAIN.

397
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:49,000
CAN'T BELIEVE, YOU ACTUALLY
WRECKED INTO THIS CORNER.

398
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:56,541
- THAT WAS DIRTY LITTLE TRICK

399
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:58,208
YOUR BOYS PULLED
OUT HERE TONIGHT.

400
00:20:58,291 --> 00:20:59,583
AND DON'T PRETEND
YOU DON'T KNOW

401
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:01,458
WHO SPILLED THE OIL
ACROSS THE ROAD.

402
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:02,666
- I AIN'T PRETENDING NOTHING.

403
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:05,000
ALL MY GUYS ARE GEARING
UP FOR THE RACE.

404
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:06,791
AND I'D APPRECIATE IT IF
YOU WOULDN'T ACCUSE ME

405
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:08,416
OF B.S. LIKE THAT.

406
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,000
OKAY? BESIDES WHAT PROOF
DO YOU HAVE WE HAD

407
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:12,541
ANYTHING TO DO
WITH ANYTHING?

408
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:13,958
- DON'T MESS WITH ME, MAN.

409
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:16,250
I DON'T NEED ANY PROOF TO
KNOW WHO SABOTAGED MY CAR.

410
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:18,541
NOW GET OUT HERE AND
WE'LL SETTLE THIS LIKE MEN.

411
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:20,541
- KEISUKE. KNOCK IT OFF,
OKAY, NOT NOW.

412
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:23,916
- OH, YOU'RE REALLY SCARY
WHEN YOU GET MAD.

413
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,750
LOOKS LIKE PROJECT D'S
GOT THEMSELVES

414
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:28,166
A LITTLE BIT OF A LOOSE
CANNON ON THEIR HANDS.

415
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:29,666
WONDER IF YOU'RE ALL LIKE THAT.

416
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,708
ACCUSE ME OF SOMETHING
WITH NO PROOF,

417
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:34,291
THEN YOU TRY TO GET ME
TO GET OUT OF MY CAR.

418
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:36,750
YOU REALLY THINK YOU CAN
TAKE ME IN A FIGHT, BIG MAN?

419
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:38,708
I'M NOT SO SURE
YOU DON'T WANT THAT.

420
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:41,958
AND I'M NOT SURE I WANT TO RACE
AGAINST ASSHOLES LIKE YOU.

421
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:44,666
- WE'RE SORRY ABOUT ALL OF THIS.
LET'S FORGET IT EVER HAPPENED.

422
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,666
BUT AS YOU CAN SEE THE FD
WE RACE ON THE UPHILLS

423
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,125
IS IN PRETTY BAD SHAPE.

424
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:50,416
WE CAN GET IT FIXED UP,
IT'S JUST GOING TO TAKE US

425
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,833
A LITTLE MORE THAN A DAY
TO DO IT RIGHT.

426
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:56,458
- OH, THAT'S TOO BAD.
AN UNFORTUNATE TURN OF EVENTS.

427
00:21:56,541 --> 00:21:59,541
- I KNOW THIS MIGHT COME OFF
AS A SOMEWHAT SELFISH REQUEST,

428
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:01,166
BUT DO YOU THINK YOU
COULD POSTPONE THE BATTLE

429
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,250
FOR ANOTHER WEEK?

430
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:04,500
- GEE, ANOTHER WEEK, HUH?

431
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:07,208
- YEAH, JUST GIVE US A WEEK
AND WE CAN HAVE HER FIXED,

432
00:22:07,291 --> 00:22:08,708
NO PROBLEM.

433
00:22:08,791 --> 00:22:11,125
- THAT MAKES PERFECT SENSE
AND I UNDERSTAND THE PREDICAMENT

434
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:15,708
THAT YOU'RE IN. BUT I THINK
I'M GONNA HAVE TO SAY NO.

435
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:18,125
WE'VE GOT LIVES OUTSIDE
OF RACING, YOU KNOW.

436
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:19,958
I GOT A DATE NEXT WEEK
AND I AIN'T GONNA CANCELING

437
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:21,416
'CAUSE YOU SCREWED UP A CAR.

438
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,666
- SON OF A BITCH.

439
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:25,166
- IN THE RACING WORLD,

440
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:26,791
THE CAR THAT CAN'T MAKE IT TO
THE STARTING LINE ON TIME

441
00:22:26,875 --> 00:22:28,958
IS THE LOSER BY DEFAULT.

442
00:22:29,041 --> 00:22:31,541
BIG TIME BOYS LIKE YOU
SHOULD KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

443
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:34,791
SO, KEEP YOUR EXCUSES
TO YOURSELF.

444
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:37,708
WE'RE DOING THIS THING
WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT.

445
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:40,541
WE START AT EIGHT, I DON'T
CARE IF IT'S THE EIGHT-SIX,

446
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:42,500
OR A BOX WITH WHEELS
TAPED TO THE BOTTOM,

447
00:22:42,583 --> 00:22:44,000
JUST GET A REPLACEMENT.

448
00:22:44,083 --> 00:22:45,750
AND TRY TO BE ON TIME, HUH?

449
00:22:45,833 --> 00:22:47,458
ONE MINUTE LATE AND YOU
FORFEIT THE RACE,

450
00:22:47,541 --> 00:22:50,208
AND LEAVE SAITAMA WITH
A LOSS UNDER YOUR BELT.

451
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,750
- DAMN IT!

452
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:58,166
I'M GONNA END THAT PRICK
WHEN I GET THE CHANCE.

453
00:22:58,250 --> 00:22:59,791
- IF YOUR FINISHED
YELLING AT THE GUARDRAIL,

454
00:22:59,875 --> 00:23:01,250
WE'VE GOT WORK TO DO.

455
00:23:01,333 --> 00:23:02,916
FUJIWARA, MATSUMOTO,

456
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,041
YOU TWO FINISH GETTING THE
EIGHT-SIX READY.

457
00:23:05,125 --> 00:23:06,958
- YOU GOT IT.
- WE'LL GET ON IT RIGHT NOW.

458
00:23:07,041 --> 00:23:10,291
- NOT SO FAST, UNTIL WE GET THE
REST OF THAT OIL CLEARED OFF,

459
00:23:10,375 --> 00:23:12,916
SPLIT THE COURSE IN HALF
FOR YOUR PRACTICE.

460
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,916
AND WE'LL GET STARTED
ON CLEAN UP RIGHT NOW.

461
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,583
WE HAVE VERY LITTLE
TIME FOR IT, SO LET'S MOVE.

462
00:23:17,666 --> 00:23:18,958
- HOLD ON A SECOND.

463
00:23:19,041 --> 00:23:21,083
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?
SIT ON MY ASS AND WAIT?

464
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:23,708
WHAT ABOUT FIXING MY FD?
I'M GONNA NEED A LITTLE HELP.

465
00:23:23,791 --> 00:23:26,833
- IT'D BE POINTLESS TO TRY.
I'VE CONSIDERED EVERY OPTION

466
00:23:26,916 --> 00:23:28,958
AND DECIDED FIXING YOUR CAR
WOULD BE AN EXERCISE

467
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:30,583
IN FUTILITY AT THIS POINT,

468
00:23:30,666 --> 00:23:32,375
WE JUST DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME.

469
00:23:32,458 --> 00:23:34,208
YOU DON'T HAVE A JOB TO DO
ON THIS RACE ANYMORE,

470
00:23:34,291 --> 00:23:36,000
SO, YOU SHOULD START WORKING
FROM THE SIDELINES.

471
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:38,041
- YOU GOTTA LET ME RACE.
LEAVE ME OUTTA THIS

472
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:40,166
AND YOU'LL JUST BE GIVING THEM
EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANT.

473
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:42,541
- YOU REALLY STILL DON'T
UNDERSTAND, DO YOU?

474
00:23:42,625 --> 00:23:45,375
THE REASON THE FD TOOK THE HIT
IT DID WAS BECAUSE OF YOU.

475
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:47,208
- BECAUSE OF ME?

476
00:23:47,291 --> 00:23:49,958
- THAT'S RIGHT. DO YOU THINK
IF IT'D BEEN ME BEHIND THE WHEEL

477
00:23:50,041 --> 00:23:52,500
THAT I WOULD HAVE FALLEN FOR A
PATHETIC LITTLE TRAP LIKE THAT?

478
00:23:53,958 --> 00:23:56,083
YOUR PRIDE AND CARELESSNESS
GOT THE BEST OF YOU.

479
00:23:56,166 --> 00:23:58,708
NOW, GO COOL AND THINK
ABOUT WHAT YOU DID.

480
00:23:58,791 --> 00:24:00,416
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET TO WORK.

481
00:24:11,208 --> 00:24:13,833
- I DON'T BUY THAT. I GET WHAT
HE WAS SAYING,

482
00:24:13,916 --> 00:24:16,666
BUT I THINK HE WAS
TOO HARSH ON YOU.

483
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,500
NO WAY HE COULD HAVE DODGED
THAT MUCH OIL,

484
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:20,125
I DON'T CARE HOW GOOD
A DRIVER HE IS.

485
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:22,333
IT WAS EVERYWHERE. I JUST
DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD

486
00:24:22,416 --> 00:24:24,666
TAKE WHAT HE
SAID SO SERIOUSLY.

487
00:24:26,208 --> 00:24:28,875
- YOU'RE WRONG. MY BROTHER
COULD'VE DONE IT.

488
00:24:28,958 --> 00:24:31,125
COULD'VE BLOWN OVER THAT SLICK
LIKE IT WAS NOTHING

489
00:24:31,208 --> 00:24:33,875
BUT DRY PAVEMENT AND
KEPT ON ROLLING.

490
00:24:33,958 --> 00:24:37,458
RYOSUKE WAS RIGHT ABOUT
EVERYTHING HE WAS SAYING

491
00:24:37,541 --> 00:24:39,791
AND DEEP DOWN INSIDE,
I KNOW IT'S TRUE.

492
00:24:39,875 --> 00:24:42,083
I'M PISSED OFF AT MYSELF
THAT I FELL RIGHT INTO SUCH

493
00:24:42,166 --> 00:24:43,791
A BUSH LEAGUE TRICK
SO FREAKING EASILY

494
00:24:43,875 --> 00:24:45,833
JUST BECAUSE OF MY ATTITUDE.

495
00:24:45,916 --> 00:24:48,875
IT'S ALL CAUSE OF ME. THAT'S
WHY I GOTTA DRIVE TONIGHT

496
00:24:48,958 --> 00:24:50,666
NO MATTER WHAT.

497
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:52,791
WHAT THE HELL ELSE
AM I GONNA DO?

498
00:24:52,875 --> 00:24:55,291
TELL ME, KENTA,
WHAT ELSE CAN I DO?

499
00:24:55,375 --> 00:24:57,375
- I JUST... I DON'T KNOW.

500
00:25:03,458 --> 00:25:05,250
- SUCKS TO BE KEISUKE RIGHT NOW,

501
00:25:05,333 --> 00:25:08,208
WANTING TO DRIVE SO BADLY
BUT NOT BEING ABLE TO.

502
00:25:08,291 --> 00:25:09,625
PISSES ME OFF, TOO.

503
00:25:13,208 --> 00:25:16,500
BUT RIGHT NOW, ALL I CAN DO
IS FOCUS ON THE TASK AT HAND.

504
00:25:16,583 --> 00:25:20,500
KEEP MY MIND ON THE RACE AND
BEAT THOSE GUYS INTO THE GROUND.

505
00:25:27,041 --> 00:25:29,166
