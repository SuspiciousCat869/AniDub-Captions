YOU SHOULD BE RESTING UP
FOR THE BIG RACE TONIGHT.

31
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:14,666
THAT'S WHAT YOU
SHOULD BE FOCUSING ON.

- YEAH, BUT...

33
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:19,458

THIS TO ALL OF YOU.

34
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:21,583
I'M A REALIST. I KNOW
MY CHANCES OUT THERE

35
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:24,958
ARE SLIM TO NONE,
WHATEVER WE DO.

36
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:29,166
STILL, DON'T THINK THAT I'M
GONNA TAKE THAT LYING DOWN.

37
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,541
I HAD MY HEAD UP MY ASS

38
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:33,000
AND BECAUSE OF IT PROJECT
D'S REP IS ON THE LINE.

39
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:35,500
THIS IS MY RESPONSIBILITY.

40
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:39,083
SO WHATEVER THE HELL IT TAKES,
I AM GONNA RACE TONIGHT.

- FOR NOW, THE NAME OF THE
GAME IS "PACE YOURSELF".

43
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,625
PROMISE ME YOU WON'T DO
ANYTHING CRAZY, OKAY?

44
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:56,500
- PROMISE.

45
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:58,083
- THOSE RIGHT-HAND CORNERS
ARE GONNA BE MURDER

46
00:04:58,166 --> 00:04:59,666
ON YOUR LEFT FRONT SIDE,

47
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:02,708
SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO TAKE 'EM AS
GENTLY AS POSSIBLE. YOU GOT ME?

48
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:06,416
- I GOT YOU, DUDE. ALL RIGHT.
I'M OUT OF HERE , PEACE.

49
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:20,958
COME ON, BABY.
SHOW ME WHATCHA GOT.

50
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:24,208
FOR THE SAKE OF EVERYONE WHO
LOST SLEEP TRYIN' TO FIX YOU.

51
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:29,416
FOR THE SAKE OF MY PRIDE,
SHOW ME A MIRACLE!

52
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:34,333
- ( people laughing )

53
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:37,208
- THOSE JERK WADS' FACES
WERE PALER'N MY ASS.

54
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:39,458
AND MR. PRETTY BOY WITH HIS
PRECIOUS SPIKED HAIR

55
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:41,083
LOOKED LIKE HE WAS
ABOUT READY TO RUN HOME

56
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:42,708
AND CRY TO HIS MOMMA!

57
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:45,250
OH, HE MIGHT TALK A BIG GAME,
BUT WHEN THE CHIPS ARE DOWN,

58
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:47,416
MAN'S GOT NOTHING TO
PONY UP WITH.

59
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,750
- IF WE CAN MANAGE TO INTIMIDATE
THE EIGHT SIX'S DRIVER

60
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:51,208
HALF AS EASILY AS THE FD'S,

61
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:53,750
THEN I'D SAY WE HAVE THIS RACE
PRETTY MUCH IN THE BAG.

62
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:55,875
- IN THE BAG AND
OVER OUR SHOULDER.

63
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:57,208
- ( all laughing )

64
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:05,250
- ( tires screeching )

65
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,125
- THERE'S A WEIRD VIBRATION
WHEN I BRAKE AT THIS SPEED,

66
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,041
BUT LOOKS LIKE SHE CAN STILL
HANDLE THE LEFT-HAND CORNERS

67
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:19,041
THE WAY SHE ALWAYS DOES.

68
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:21,041
THE RIGHT-HANDERS, THOUGH,

69
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:23,166
THEY'RE THE ONES THAT HAVE
GOT ME WORRIED.

70
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,625
LET'S SEE IF ALL THAT
ELBOW GREASE WAS FOR NOTHING.

71
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:35,208
DAMMIT!

72
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:37,833
- ( tires screeching )

73
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:45,375
- ( breathing heavily )

74
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:47,166
SON OF A BITCH!

75
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,083
- ( honking )

76
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:56,125
- I WAS ONLY DRIVIN' HER AT
EIGHTY PERCENT,

77
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:58,958
BUT THE MOMENT I SHIFTED THE
WEIGHT TO THE LEFT FRONT SIDE,

78
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:03,291
FRIGGIN' THING SPUN LIKE A TOP.
IT'S HOPELESS!

79
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:07,833
AND HERE I WAS THINKIN' I COULD
MAKE THIS WORK. WHAT A DUMBASS.

80
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:12,541
WHAT THE HELL AM I GONNA DO?

81
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:15,250
I'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO
FACE THE GUYS AGAIN.

82
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:21,208
SORRY, BRO. I GUESS
THAT'S WHAT YOU GET

83
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:23,291
FOR PUTTIN'
YOUR FAITH IN ME.

84
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,416
- ( car approaching )

85
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:36,666
- OH, GREAT. COMPANY.

86
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:40,416
HOLD ON A SECOND. I KNOW THAT
SOUND. THAT'S A ROTARY ENGINE.

87
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:57,750
- HEY STRANGER! MIND IF I
CHEER YOU GUYS ON TONIGHT?

88
00:07:57,833 --> 00:07:59,958
WHY ARE YOU PARKED
ALL THE WAY OUT HERE?

89
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:04,208
( stuttering )
I MEAN...

90
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:08,166
( gasping ) OH, GOD.
I KNEW IT. HE'S UPSET!

91
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:13,625
HE PROBABLY THINKS I'M STALKING
HIM. MAN I BLEW IT!

92
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:17,958
- LISTEN TO ME. THIS IS
IMPORTANT. DO YOU TRUST ME?

93
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:24,083
I KNOW EVEN AS FAR
BACK AS WHEN

94
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:25,583
WE CALLED OURSELVES
THE RED SUNS,

95
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:27,791
THE WHOLE IDEA OF
COMPETING IN A BORROWED CAR

96
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:29,708
HAS BEEN STRICTLY FORBIDDEN.

97
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:31,208
I'VE ALWAYS ACCEPTED THAT,

98
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:34,000
BUT IT'S JUST NOT GOING TO
WORK FOR ME TONIGHT.

99
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:36,541
AND I DON'T CARE IF YOU
GET THAT OR NOT, BRO.

100
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:38,208
IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT, FINE.

101
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:40,916
THIS RACE DOESN'T HAVE TO BE
A LEGIT D BATTLE.

102
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,458
BUT I'LL BE DAMNED.

103
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:45,041
I WILL BE DAMNED IF YOU DON'T
LET ME GET OUR DIGNITY BACK!

104
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:53,250
- ( sighing )

105
00:08:57,666 --> 00:08:59,625
- IT'S ME, RYOSUKE.

106
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:01,208
I KNOW THIS IS KINDA LATE,

107
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:05,000
BUT WE WON'T BE NEEDING
THAT CAR AFTER ALL.

108
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:08,291
YEAH. THAT'S RIGHT.
MY APOLOGIES.

109
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:10,500
I'LL CALL YOU LATER, OKAY?

110
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:12,250
- HANG ON. WAIT A MINUTE.

111
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:14,291
YOU LET ME GO ON
AND ON LIKE THAT

112
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:15,541
AND YOU'D ALREADY MADE
ARRANGEMENTS FOR ANOTHER CAR

113
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:16,958
TO BE BROUGHT HERE TONIGHT?

114
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:20,125
- IT'S NOT LIKE I WANTED TO BUT
WHAT CHOICE DID WE HAVE?

115
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:24,583
WHEN YOU BACKS AGAINST THE WALL
YOU DO WHAT YOU GOTTA.

116
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:26,958
I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO INTENTION
OF COMPROMISING

117
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:29,333
PROJECT D'S WINNING
STREAK BY DEFAULT.

118
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:31,708
ESPECIALLY IF IT MEANS
CONCEDING TO THEM.

119
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:32,750
- ( gasping )

120
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:35,666
- YEAH!

121
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,500
- YEAH, THAT'S ALL
WELL AND GOOD,

122
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:39,041
BUT DON'T YOU THINK THESE
GUYS ARE GONNA OBJECT

123
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:40,416
TO OUR SWITCHING CARS LIKE THIS?

124
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,458
I MEAN, C'MON, YOU KNOW ANY
LITTLE THING THEY THINK

125
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:45,458
MIGHT GIVE US AN ADVANTAGE WILL
JUST BE FLAT-OUT REFUSED.

126
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:47,250
WE'RE TALKIN' ABOUT USING A
CAR THEY HADN'T EVEN COUNTED ON

127
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:48,750
RACING IN THE FIRST PLACE.

128
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:50,333
THERE'S NO WAY ARE THEY GONNA
LET US SLIP BY WITH THAT.

129
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:53,291
IT'S FUNNY YOU SHOULD BRING THAT
UP, 'CAUSE I HAVE A JOB FOR YOU.

130
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:56,500
IT'S GONNA REQUIRE JUST A
LITTLE BIT OF SWEET-TALKING

131
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:59,416
ON YOUR PART, AND A HELLUVA
LOT OF AGGRESSION.

132
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,416
- COME OFF IT MAN.

133
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,333
DON'T TRY TO SELL ME
IT'S THE SAME MODEL LINE,

134
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:05,000
IT'S A TOTALLY DIFFERENT CAR.

135
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:07,250
GIMME A BREAK. I MEAN,
WHAT DO WE LOOK LIKE TO YOU,

136
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:08,583
A COUPLE OF CHUMPS?

137
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:10,541
- NO, NOT AT ALL. I GUESS,
I'M JUST KINDA SURPRISED

138
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:11,833
TO SEE YOU TAKING IT SO HARD,

139
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:13,916
GIVEN HOW EAGER YOU WERE
FOR US TO REPLACE THE FD

140
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
WITH THE EIGHT SIX.

141
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:16,666
- WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU
BLABBING ABOUT?

142
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,541
WE NEVER SAID
ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

143
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,833
- ISN'T THE EIGHT SIX THE SAME
MODEL TRAINING CAR THEY USE

144
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:22,416
IN F1 RACING?

145
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,416
COME NOW, GENTLEMEN, LET'S
NOT BE DIFFICULT ABOUT THIS.

146
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,875
THINK ABOUT IT. HE'LL STILL BE
DRIVING A BORROWED CAR

147
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:29,250
HE'S NEVER DRIVEN.

148
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,333
I'D SAY THAT GIVES YOU
THE ADVANTAGE, IF ANYTHING.

149
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:35,708
IF THAT ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH, THEN
I'M AFRAID OUR HANDS ARE TIED.

150
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:38,083
WE'LL HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO
POSTPONE TONIGHT'S RACE.

151
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:41,166
WHICH WILL JUST GIVE US THAT
MUCH MORE TIME TO PRACTICE.

152
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:44,333
- WELL THEN I'M ASSUMING IT'S
ALL RIGHT WITH THE TWO OF YOU

153
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:46,916
IF WE JUST PACK UP NOW AND
HEAD BACK TO GUNMA?

154
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,333
- ( both sighing )

155
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:52,250
- ( motor running )

156
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:55,250
- WHADYA KNOW. I GAVE 'EM THE
HARD-LINE COLD AS ICE

157
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:57,208
JUST LIKE YOU SAID, AND
THEY FELL FOR IT.

158
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:59,208
I FIGURE THEY'VE GOT MORE RIDING
ON TONIGHT'S RACE

159
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:00,708
THAN THEY'RE LETTING ON.

160
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:02,125
THEY MAY ACT LIKE
THEY'RE MORE OR LESS

161
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:04,125
BEING FORCED INTO RACING US,

162
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:07,833
BUT THE LOOK IN THEIR EYES
TELLS ME A VERY DIFFERENT STORY.

163
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:11,458
- WOW, YOU DON'T
MISS A BEAT, DO YOU?

164
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:13,666
SOMETHING HANGS IN THE BALANCE
FOR THEM OVER THIS,

165
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,208
BUT IT ISN'T THEIR PRIDE.

166
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:16,958
NOT EVEN BRAGGING RIGHTS,

167
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:18,000
WHICH MUST MEAN
THERE'S SOMETHING

168
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:20,000
FAR MORE INSIDIOUSLY SPECIFIC.

169
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:21,125
- ( gasping )

170
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:24,708
WAIT ARE YOU SAYING
IT'S ABOUT MONEY?

171
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:26,291
- MOST LIKELY.

172
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:29,666
- THOSE BASTARDS. THAT'S
WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO PULL?

173
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,875
NOW WE REALLY GOT TO
CREAM THESE GUYS!

174
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:41,666
- GOOD LUCK TONIGHT,
PRETTY BOY.

175
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:42,833
- HUH.

176
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:44,333
- YOU'LL NEED IT IF
YOU'RE SO DESPERATE

177
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:46,375
YOU GOTTA BORROW
SOMEONE ELSE'S CAR.

178
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:49,833
MAN OH MAN, SOME PEOPLE
JUST HAVE NO SHAME.

179
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:52,791
- HE'S AN ASSHOLE, KEISUKE.
TRY TO IGNORE HIM.

180
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:54,916
HE'S ONLY TRYING TO
MESS WITH YOUR HEAD.

181
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,875
- TRUST ME, IT'S COOL.

182
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:58,500
YOU THINK A CHEAP SHOT
LIKE THAT'S GONNA MAKE ME

183
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:00,708
FORGET HOW LUCKY
I AM TO BE HERE?

184
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:02,083
BELIEVE IT OR NOT, GUYS,

185
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:04,083
RIGHT NOW THERE'S NOT A DAMN
THING ANYBODY COULD SAY

186
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:06,541
THAT WOULD MAKE ME FEEL
ANYTHING BUT GRATITUDE.

187
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:11,083
WHERE WOULD I BE
WITHOUT THIS TEAM?

188
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:13,875
WITHOUT THESE GUYS.
WITHOUT HER.

189
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:16,375
- LET'S DO THIS THING!

190
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:22,166
IN FIVE, FOUR, THREE,

191
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:25,208
TWO, ONE. GO!

192
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:37,000
- THE PORCUPINE CAN WATCH MY
TAIL LIGHTS GET SMALLER

193
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:39,500
WHILE HE'S BUSY FEELIN' OUT
HIS NEW RIDE.

194
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:41,875
THAT'S WHY I CHOSE TO LEAD.

195
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:45,416
HELL, I'M NOT STUPID. I'M IN
THIS FOR THE SUREFIRE WIN.

196
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:56,125
- SO, RYOSUKE, THERE'S SOMETHING

197
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:58,375
I'VE BEEN MEANING
TO ASK YOU ABOUT.

198
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:00,541
I MEAN, YOU ALREADY HAD A
REPLACEMENT CAR EN ROUTE

199
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:03,500
WHEN YOU DECIDED TO LET KEISUKE
GO WITH THE GIRL'S FD.

200
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:04,833
IT WAS THE RIGHT CALL TO MAKE

201
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:06,416
BUT IT JUST DOESN'T SEEM YOUR
CHARACTER FOR YOU

202
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,333
TO CHANGE YOUR MIND
SO ARBITRARILY.

203
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:11,416
- WHAT'VE I TOLD YOU ABOUT
JUMPING TO CONCLUSIONS?

204
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,458
MAYBE WHEN THE OPPORTUNITY
PRESENTED ITSELF,

205
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:15,708
I SIMPLY THOUGHT IT BEST
FOR KEISUKE TO FIX THE SITUATION

206
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:17,000
ON HIS OWN TERMS.

207
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:18,791
BASED ON HIS OWN EXPERIENCE.

208
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:22,708
- OF COURSE! HE'S ALREADY
FAMILIAR WITH KYOKO'S CAR

209
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:24,125
FROM WHEN THE TWO OF THEM RACED!

210
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:25,875
- AND HENCE MY DECISION.

211
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:27,750
HE'S GOTTEN A CLOSE LOOK
AT HOW THAT VEHICLE

212
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:29,750
OPERATES AT ITS LIMITS,

213
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:34,500
AND PERHAPS MORE IMPORTANTLY,
HOW IT DIFFERS FROM HIS OWN FD.

214
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:36,875
MY CHOICES MAY SEEM
ARBITRARY SOMETIMES,

215
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:39,208
BUT IN THE END I'M
AN OPPORTUNIST.

216
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:41,708
WHENEVER I SEE SOMETHING THAT
INCREASES OUR CHANCES

217
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:43,875
OF WINNING, I JUMP ON IT.

218
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:45,875
I'LL ADMIT, THOUGH, IT WAS
DAMN LUCKY FOR US

219
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,791
THAT THAT GIRL SHOWED
UP HERE TONIGHT.

220
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:50,750
KEISUKE OWES HER ONE.
WE ALL DO.

221
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:59,375
- AWESOME! JUST LIKE I THOUGHT.

222
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:02,708
THIS BABY'S GOT POWER AND
A KILLER SUSPENSION SYSTEM.

223
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:05,583
THANKS, KYOKO,
THIS IS ONE HELL OF A RIDE!

224
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:10,666
- OKAY, I'VE GOTTA ASK,
ARE YOU FEELIN' ALRIGHT?

225
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,583
I NEVER IN A MILLION YEARS
THOUGHT I'D SEE YOU LET

226
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:14,708
SOMEONE ELSE BEHIND
THE WHEEL OF THAT THING.

227
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:16,375
- I HATE TO AGREE
WITH HIM, KYOKO,

228
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:18,000
BUT YOU HAVE TO KNOW
BY NOW YOUR OBSESSION

229
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:20,458
WITH THAT CAR IS RATHER
SOMETHING OF A LOCAL LEGEND.

230
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:22,750
- I AM SURPRISED AT MYSELF.

231
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:24,666
IF ANYONE HAD TOLD ME EVEN A
FEW WEEKS AGO

232
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,708
THAT I'D BE LETTING SOMEONE
BORROW MY PRIDE AND JOY,

233
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:28,875
I'D HAVE TOLD THEM TO GET
THEIR HEAD EXAMINED.

234
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:31,750
BUT RIGHT NOW I COULDN'T BE
HAPPIER TO HELP KEISUKE OUT.

235
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:35,875
I MEAN, IT'S KINDA LIKE TONIGHT
WAS JUST DESTINED TO BE.

236
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,500
IF LENDING HIM MY CAR
WILL HELP MY DARLING,

237
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:40,041
YOU BETTER BELIEVE I'LL DO IT.

238
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:43,041
THERE ISN'T ANYTHING
I WOULDN'T DO FOR HIM.

239
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:46,375
I'M ROOTING FOR YOU, BABE,
JUST LIKE I SAID I WOULD.

240
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:48,583
DON'T YOU DARE LOSE THIS!

241
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:03,916
- ( tires screeching )

242
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:10,250
- HOLY CRAP! ARE YOU SEEIN' THE
SLIDE CONTROL THAT DUDE'S GOT?

243
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:12,791
- THAT'S NOT EVEN HIS OWN CAR,
MAN, HE HAD TO GET IT ON LOAN.

244
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:15,458
IF THIS KEISUKE'S NOT AN FD
SPECIALIST I SURE AS HELL

245
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:17,041
DON'T KNOW WHAT ONE LOOKS LIKE.

246
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:19,708
- DON'T GET YOU PANTIES IN A WAD
YET, HE'S STILL GETTIN' DUSTED.

247
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:21,416
THIS IS GONNA BE A TOUGH ONE.

248
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,416
WORD ON THE STREET IS THAT GUY
DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE TO

249
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,791
RUN THE COURSE AT ALL
LAST NIGHT, NOT EVEN ONE.

250
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:28,708
- HE'S RACING A LAN EVO
WHEN HE DIDN'T PRACTICE?

251
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:31,458
HE MAYBE GOOD BUT
THAT'S JUST FREAKIN' CRAZY.

252
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:41,291
- I REMEMBER READING SOMETHING
IN A CAR MAGAZINE ONCE,

253
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:45,083
FOR SHEER SPEEDS ON THE STREETS
THE LAN EVO IS SECOND TO NONE.

254
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:47,333
SORRY, FD, BUT THIS
IS ONE LESSON

255
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:49,416
YOUR GONNA HAVE TO LEARN
THE HARD WAY.

256
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:58,208
TIME FOR TRASH TALK
IS OVER, PRETTY BOY,

257
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,125
NOW GET OUT OF MY SIGHT!

258
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:06,666
- YOU KNOW I THINK I GET IT NOW.

259
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:10,125
THE POINT OF THIS RACE IS
ACTUALLY PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD.

260
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:11,458
UNLESS I'M WRONG,

261
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:14,166
KEISUKE IS FACING TWO MAJOR
HANDICAPS OUT THERE.

262
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:17,000
ONE, HE'S HAVING TO
DRIVE SOMEONE ELSE'S CAR,

263
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:19,625
AND TWO, HE NEVER GOT THE CHANCE
TO DO ANY PRACTICE RUNS

264
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:20,666
ON THIS COURSE.

265
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,208
UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES LIKE THESE,

266
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:24,333
YOU WOULDN'T THINK HE HAD
A CHANCE TO WIN.

267
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:27,000
BUT IF THERE'S THE SLIGHTEST
GAP IN HIS OPPONENT'S SKILL,

268
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:28,708
IT'LL LEVEL THE PLAYING
FIELD FOR HIM.

269
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:31,250
AND I'M PRETTY SURE SAYING
KEISUKE'S BETTER THAN THIS GUY

270
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:33,291
WOULD BE THE UNDERSTATEMENT
OF THE YEAR.

271
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:35,291
- OH YEAH, YOU THINK SO?

272
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:38,250
- IT'S KINDA HARD TO EXPLAIN.

273
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:40,708
MY INSTINCTS TELL ME HIS
OPPONENT'S NOT MUCH OF A DRIVER

274
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,041
TO BEGIN WITH.

275
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:44,458
I THINK IF KEISUKE WAS
GOING TOE-TO-TOE WITH HIM

276
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:46,833
UNDER NORMAL CONDITIONS, THIS
RACE WOULD BE OVER BY NOW.

277
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:48,041
- I GET IT.

278
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:49,500
- IT'S ONLY BECAUSE
OF THOSE HANDICAPS THAT

279
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:52,041
HE'S BEEN BEHIND THIS DOUCHE
BAG FOR AS LONG AS HE HAS.

280
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:55,000
THAT'S WHAT THE HILL CLIMB
IS ABOUT. YOU'LL SEE.

281
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:07,583
- WHY CAN'T I SHAKE THIS GUY?
DAMN IT.

282
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:12,000
- ( tires screeching )

283
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:29,625
- C'MON! I'M DRIVING A LAN EVO
FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!

284
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:31,458
I NEARLY LOST IT BACK
THERE FLOORING IT

285
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:33,125
THROUGH THE TIGHTEST CORNER
ON THIS TRACK

286
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:35,583
AND THE BASTARD'S STILL
RIGHT ON TOP OF ME!

287
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:37,125
HOW CAN SOMEONE BE THAT GOOD

288
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:40,000
WHEN THEY HAVEN'T RUN
THE COURSE BEFORE?

289
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:42,333
- GO ANY SLOWER AND THAT
PRISSY LIL' RIDE OF YOURS

290
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:43,916
MIGHT AS WELL BE

302
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:15,041
RIGHT THERE ON THOSE
UPCOMING S-CURVES.

303
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:18,375
DON'T SCREW THIS UP. JUST
COME AT HIM FROM THE INSIDE,

304
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:20,208
TIGHT AS YOU CAN.

305
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:22,416
IT'LL BE TRICKY, THE EVO
WILL GET JUST A LITTLE BIT

306
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,958
OF DISTANCE ON ME.

307
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:26,833
BUT IF I DO THIS RIGHT,
THE LINE'LL OPEN OUT

308
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:29,166
ON THE NEXT LEFT-HANDER AND GIVE
ME SOME CORNERING SPEED.

309
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,791
ONCE WE HIT THE LONG
SRAIGHTAWAY,

310
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:33,083
I'LL LEAVE HIM IN THE DUST!

311
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:37,416
THAT'S THE SAME EXIT-ORIENTED
CORNERING STRATEGY I USED

312
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,250
AGAINST THE R34 IN TOCHIGI.

313
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:41,666
THE LAN EVO DOESN'T STAND
A CHANCE AGAINST IT.

314
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,833
TIME TO TAKE THIS PUNK
TO SCHOOL!

315
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:53,208
- YOU IDIOT! WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

316
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:54,708
HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND?

317
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:56,708
THE ROAD UP AHEAD IS
UNDER CONSTRUCTION.

318
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:58,791
THERE'S A BARRICADE
ON THE LEFT SHOULDER!

319
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:01,041
IT'S NOT WIDE ENOUGH
FOR BOTH CARS!

320
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:07,500
DON'T GET ANY CLOSER TO ME,
YOU MORON!

321
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:09,750
YOU'RE GONNA PUSH ME
INTO THE FRIGGIN' EMBANKMENT!

322
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:15,333
( screaming )
YOU SON OF A BITCH!

323
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:16,791
- EASY, BIG GUY.

324
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:20,375
- ( gasping )

325
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:32,458
- ( tires screeching )

326
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:36,083
- CRAZY BASTARD!

327
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:37,625
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

328
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:39,916
WHAT KIND OF HORSE SHIT WERE YOU
TRYING TO PULL BACK THERE?

329
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,250
YOU COULD HAVE KILLED BOTH OF US
WITH THAT LITTLE STUNT OF YOURS!

330
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:44,416
IS THAT PROJECT D'S IDEA
OF A FAIR RACE?

331
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,083
IF I HADN'T BACKED OFF
AT THE LAST SECOND

332
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:47,875
WE'D HAVE HAD ONE HELL OF
A MESS ON OUR HANDS.

333
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:49,458
THANKS TO YOU.

334
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:52,000
- YOU'RE KIDDING ME. YOU DON'T
ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT, DO YOU?

335
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:53,166
- WAIT, WHAT?

336
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,541
- YOU MEAN YOU REALLY
HAVE NO CLUE?

337
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:56,833
- THE HELL YOU SAYIN'?

338
00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:57,916
- THERE WAS JUST
ENOUGH CLEARANCE

339
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,500
THAT IF YOU'D PULLED YOUR CAR

340
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:01,500
ALL THE WAY OVER TO THE RIGHT,
WE COULDA BOTH GOTTEN THROUGH.

341
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:03,625
BUT HEY, YOU KNOW THE COURSE
BETTER THAN I DO, RIGHT?

342
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:05,416
IF YOU COULDN'T JUDGE THAT
FOR YOURSELF,

343
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,166
THERE'S NO POINT IN ME
TRYIN' TO CONVINCE YOU.

344
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,250
I COULD UNDERSTAND
YOU BEING PISSED

345
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,416
IF WE'D HAD CENTRIFUGAL
FORCE PUSHING ON US,

346
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,250
BUT IT WAS A FRIGGIN'
STRAIGHTAWAY.

347
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:16,083
IF I'D HAVE HAD MY CAR TWO
CENTIMETERS FROM THE BARRICADE,

348
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:18,000
THERE'D STILL HAVE BEEN FIVE
CENTIMETERS OF PLAY

349
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:19,500
BETWEEN YOU AND THE GUARDRAIL.

350
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,500
- YOU COULDN'T TELL THAT?
- HUH?

351
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:23,500
NO WAY IN HELL
ANYONE COULD TELL THAT.

352
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:25,500
- LOOK IF YOU DON'T
UNDERSTAND YOUR OWN CARS,

353
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:27,666
BET THIS CONVERSATION
IS POINTLESS.

354
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,708
NEXT TIME YOU WANT TO
COME AT ME LIKE THIS,

355
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:31,958
DO IT ON THE COURSE NOT BY
BITCHING ABOUT MY TECHNIQUE

356
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:33,625
AFTER THE RACE IS OVER,

357
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:35,708
YOU KNOW LIKE AN ACTUAL DRIVER.

358
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:38,250
WHY DON'T YOU TRY A FULL SPEED
BREAKING CONTEST SOMETIME,

359
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:40,750
THAT'LL SHOW YOU WHAT A REAL
STREET BATTLE IS LIKE.

360
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:42,916
RIGHT NOW YOU CAN'T EVEN
TALK TO ME.

361
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:47,916
I THINK THAT'S ABOUT DONE GIVING
FREE LESSONS, HOTSHOT.

362
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,958
NOW WHY DON'T YOU RUN ALONG AND
STOP WASTING EVERYONE'S TIME.

363
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,541
- JUST AS I EXPECTED.
- UH-HUH.

364
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:06,333
- THANKS A LOT.
YOU'VE GOT ONE HELL OF A CAR.

365
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:17,541
- ( growling )

366
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:20,708
- HEY DON'T TRY TO START
ANYTHING WITH HIM, MAN.

367
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:24,041
NOT WHILE THE GALLERY
IS WATCHING.

368
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:25,416
- THIS ISN'T GOOD.

369
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,875
I DIDN'T THINK WE COULD LOSE
ON THE HILL CLIMB.

370
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:30,083
BUT OUR NEXT OPPONENT'S A KID.

371
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:33,666
I DON'T THINK I'VE GOT THAT MUCH
TO WORRY ABOUT.

372
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,041
( laughing )

373
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:44,375
- LOOKS TO ME LIKE THEY JUST
REMOVED THE REAR WING

374
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:45,958
FROM THE LAN EVO, HUH.

375
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:48,791
MIGHT BE THE EVO SIX? HARD TO
TELL. HAVE YOU EVER SEEN ONE?

376
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:52,208
- YEAH, A WHILE AGO.
LOOKS LIKE IT.

377
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:53,708
- YOU AND ME NEED TO
HAVE A LITTLE CHAT

378
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:56,375
BEFORE WE START, SPORT.

379
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:59,958
MAN, YOU'RE A YOUNG ONE, HUH?
WHAT'S YOUR NAME, KID?

380
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:02,833
- IT'S FUJIWARA.
- WELL, FUJIWARA.

381
00:22:02,916 --> 00:22:04,708
I'D HATE TO BE THE ONE
TO TELL YOU THIS

382
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:06,416
BUT JUST BETWEEN YOU AND ME

383
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,750
YOU AND YOUR
LITTLE CREW OVER THERE

384
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:09,500
ARE IN FOR A WORLD OF HURT.

385
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:10,916
- WHAT?

386
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,083
- MY BUDDY DIDN'T APPRECIATE
YOUR BOY YELLING AT HIM.

387
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:14,958
HE MAY HAVE GONE OFF
THE DEEP END .

388
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:17,041
HE'S PRETTY MUCH THE WORST
KIND OF SORE LOSER,

389
00:22:17,125 --> 00:22:18,500
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

390
00:22:18,583 --> 00:22:20,666
HE JUST CALLED A BUNCH
OF HIS BRUISER CRONIES OVER

391
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:23,208
TO COME AND KICK
YOUR FRIENDS' ASSES.

392
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:24,791
QUIT GIVING ME
THE STINK EYE, DUDE.

393
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:26,750
I DON'T WANT THIS COMIN'
TO BLOWS ANY MORE THAN YOU DO.

394
00:22:26,833 --> 00:22:28,541
I JUST THOUGHT A HEADS-UP
MIGHT BE IN ORDER

395
00:22:28,625 --> 00:22:30,125
SEEIN' AS HOW NONE OF THIS
HAS TO GO DOWN,

396
00:22:30,208 --> 00:22:32,666
IF YOU DECIDE TO HELP
SMOOTH OUT THE SITUATION.

397
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,333
SEE WHAT I'M GETTING AT?

398
00:22:34,416 --> 00:22:36,833
MAYBE YOU DON'T TRY SO HARD
TO WIN THIS THING.

399
00:22:36,916 --> 00:22:39,083
- WHAT?
- MAYBE MY SORE LOSER FRIEND

400
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:41,791
SAVES SOME FACE WATCHIN' ME
PULL OUT THE WIN OVER YOU

401
00:22:41,875 --> 00:22:44,375
AND DECIDES TO CALL
HIS CRONIES OFF, YOU KNOW?

402
00:22:44,458 --> 00:22:46,333
- WHY DON'T YOU
JUST SAY IT, MAN,

403
00:22:46,416 --> 00:22:49,083
EITHER I TAKE A DIVE TONIGHT,
OR MY FRIENDS GET BEATEN UP.

404
00:22:49,166 --> 00:22:51,208
- HEY, DON'T GO PUTTIN' WORDS
IN MY MOUTH, KIDDO.

405
00:22:51,291 --> 00:22:52,958
I'M JUST TRYIN' TO DO THE
NEIGHBORLY THING HERE,

406
00:22:53,041 --> 00:22:54,375
THAT'S ALL.

407
00:22:54,458 --> 00:22:55,916
I'M JUST SAYIN' THERE ARE A LOT
MORE IMPORTANT THINGS

408
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,416
THAN WINNING.

409
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,250
LIKE BEIN' ABLE TO WALK.

410
00:23:01,208 --> 00:23:02,583
- ( engine revving )

411
00:23:05,208 --> 00:23:06,666
- WELL, ISN'T THIS FAMILIAR.

412
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:09,000
ONCE AGAIN THE PRESSURE'S
ON ME TO WIN THIS FOR US

413
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:11,166
SINCE A CERTAIN SOMEBODY
COULDN'T PULL THEIR OWN WEIGHT.

414
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:13,166
NOT THAT I'M POINTING
ANY FINGERS.

415
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:14,875
- ( grunting )

416
00:23:14,958 --> 00:23:18,541
- WHATEVER HAPPENS WE'VE GOTTA
WIN AT LEAST ONE OF THESE.

417
00:23:18,625 --> 00:23:20,041
HOPEFULLY MY LITTLE
HEART-TO-HEART

418
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:21,666
WILL HAVE DONE THE TRICK.

419
00:23:22,666 --> 00:23:24,166
- EARTH TO TAKUMI.

420
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:26,583
YOU'RE LOOKIN' A LITTLE
GRIM THERE, EVEN FOR YOU.

421
00:23:26,666 --> 00:23:29,166
YOU SURE
EVERYTHING'S ALRIGHT?

422
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:31,916
- ACTUALLY THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU PROBABLY OUGHT TO KNOW.

423
00:23:34,583 --> 00:23:36,541
- THOSE SONS-A-BITCHES.

424
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:38,916
- I DON'T KNOW MAN WHAT
DO YOU THINK I SHOULD DO?

425
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,500
- WHAT DO I THINK
YOU SHOULD DO?

426
00:23:40,583 --> 00:23:43,583
I THINK YOU SHOULD IGNORE THE
BASTARD AND FOCUS ON WINNING.

427
00:23:43,666 --> 00:23:45,833
FORGET ABOUT EVERYTHING BUT THE
ROAD IN FRONT OF YOU

428
00:23:45,916 --> 00:23:48,291
AND LET US HANDLE
EVERYTHING ELSE.

429
00:23:48,375 --> 00:23:49,708
YOU'RE HERE TO RACE,

430
00:23:49,791 --> 00:23:52,791
NOT TO BE INTIMIDATED BY TRASH
TALKING SCUM LIKE HIM.

431
00:23:52,875 --> 00:23:54,208
- I FIGURED YOU'D SAY THAT.

432
00:23:54,291 --> 00:23:56,291
I WAS THINKIN' THE
SAME THING MYSELF.

433
00:23:56,375 --> 00:23:58,041
- ALL RIGHT, PEOPLE.
LET'S DO IT!

434
00:24:00,208 --> 00:24:03,166
STARTING IN FIVE, FOUR,

435
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:06,500
THREE, TWO, ONE.

436
00:24:06,583 --> 00:24:07,708
GO!

437
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,250
- BOTH KEISUKE AND TAKUMI
ARE BEYOND

438
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:28,000
NEEDING MY ADVICE ANYMORE.

439
00:24:28,083 --> 00:24:29,791
I CAN GIVE THEM FREE RANGE
TO GO WHEREVER

440
00:24:29,875 --> 00:24:31,416
THEIR INSTINCTS LEAD THEM.

441
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:35,041
STILL, THE EVO SIX IS
NOTHING TO SNEEZE AT.

442
00:24:37,958 --> 00:24:39,750
AS HARMLESS AS IT MAY LOOK,

443
00:24:39,833 --> 00:24:41,458
THAT UNASSUMING LITTLE RAG
CAN BE QUITE THE BOMBSHELL

444
00:24:41,541 --> 00:24:43,250
ON A DOWNHILL RUN.

445
00:24:46,833 --> 00:24:48,416
- I USUALLY WOULDN'T
EXPECT TO DO TO WELL

446
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,916
AGAINST PROJECT D'S
NOTORIOUS EIGHT SIX.

447
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
NOT IN AN HONEST RACE ANYWAY.

448
00:24:53,083 --> 00:24:55,916
BUT IF I CAN KEEP THIS KID
FROM GETTING' IN THE ZONE, WELL,

449
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,083
I MEAN, WHO
COULD BLAME A GUY

450
00:24:57,166 --> 00:24:59,541
FOR WANTIN' SOME
INSURANCE, RIGHT?

451
00:24:59,625 --> 00:25:03,083
THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF
