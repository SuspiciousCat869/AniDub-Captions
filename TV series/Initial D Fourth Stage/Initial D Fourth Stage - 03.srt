ALL THE DELIVERIES, DAD.

12
00:02:14,958 --> 00:02:17,541
- Bunta: AH, GOOD JOB.

13
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:20,625
- OH, ONE THING, I DECIDED
TO GO AHEAD AND KNOCK OUT

14
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:23,583
ALL THE DELIVERIES TOMORROW AND
THE DAY AFTER THAT, IF IT'S OK.

15
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:28,916
- OH, THAT RIGHT? I THOUGHT YOU
AND I DECIDED TO TAKE TURNS

16
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,541
DOING THE DELIVERIES?

17
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:32,458
- WELL, YEAH, WE DID,

18
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:34,291
BUT MY TEAM'S GOT AN
AWAY MATCH NEXT WEEK,

19
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:37,000
SO I'M DOING THIS TO COVER,
YOU KNOW, WHILE I'M GONE.

20
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:39,875
- SO, GUESS THINGS
ARE CHANGING AROUND HERE.

21
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:41,500
NOW YOU'RE
CALLING ALL THE SHOTS.

22
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:43,291
IT USED TO BE THAT
YOU'D JUST COMPLAIN.

23
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:45,791
NOW YOU LIKE
MAKING DELIVERIES?

24
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:49,083
- IT'S NOT THAT IT'S A "GOOD
TIME" OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT,

25
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:52,500
BUT IF I DON'T DRIVE AKINA, I
START TO GET A LITTLE NERVOUS.

26
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:54,208
WHEN I'M AWAY FROM HOME,

27
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:56,208
I'M DRIVING ON ALL OF THESE
STRANGE COURSES,

28
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:58,333
PLACES I'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE.
AND I'M ALWAYS TOO FOCUSED

29
00:02:58,416 --> 00:03:00,125
ON BREAKING THEIR RECORDS.

30
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:03,000
I DON'T GET A CHANCE TO
CONSIDER ANYTHING ELSE.

31
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:05,083
I NEVER THOUGHT OF
IT LIKE THIS BEFORE,

32
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:07,000
BUT I'M RELAXED ON AKINA.

33
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,958
SOMETHING ABOUT THE WHOLE
PLACE PUTS ME AT EASE,

34
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:12,958
BECAUSE OF THAT,
I BEGIN TO NOTICE OTHER THINGS.

35
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:19,375
SEE, IT'S NOT THAT I HAVEN'T
MASTERED THE EIGHT-SIX, BUT IF

36
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:22,333
I'M GONNA TRY OUT NEW THINGS,
I WANNA DO IT HERE, I GUESS THAT

37
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:23,666
JUST MAKES THE
MOST SENSE TO ME.

38
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:27,750
TRY THE NEW STUFF ON AKINA
WHERE I'M COMFORTABLE.

39
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,250
I WON'T SAY SOMETHING
STUPID LIKE

40
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:30,625
"I WANT TO MAKE THE
DELIVERIES EVERY DAY",

41
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:35,000
BUT I THINK I'D LIKE TO DO
THEM AS OFTEN AS I CAN.

42
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:38,250
- IMPRESSIVE, KID, YOU'RE
ALREADY STARTING TO PUT TOGETHER

43
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:40,000
THE IMPORTANCE
OF A HOME COURSE.

44
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:48,625
- Itsuki: WELCOME!
- CHECK IT OUT.

45
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:50,000
- HEY...

46
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:55,125
- IT'S OUR OLD PAL.

47
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:57,166
- SHOWING YOUR FACE
AROUND HERE,

48
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,000
AND OUT IN BROAD DAYLIGHT, TOO.

49
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:00,833
- TODAY'S MY ONLY DAY OFF
FROM WORK,

50
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:02,208
I DIDN'T HAVE A
WHOLE LOT GOING ON

51
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:03,791
SO I THOUGHT I'D SWING BY HERE.

52
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:05,291
- NOW LISTEN TO ME,

53
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:07,166
HAVING NOTHING TO DO
ON A DAY OFF

54
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,000
CAN BE A MIGHTY BIG A
PROBLEM FOR A KID LIKE YOU,

55
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:10,333
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

56
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,333
HAVE YOU HEARD FROM YOUR
GIRLFRIEND LATELY?

57
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:15,125
- YEAH. YOU TALKED NATSUKI MUCH
SINCE SHE LEFT TOWN FOR TOKYO?

58
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:16,125
YOU NEVER SAY.

59
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:17,791
- GOT A LETTER
FROM HER IN APRIL.

60
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:20,666
IT SOUNDED LIKE SHE
WAS HAVING A GOOD TIME.

61
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,458
KNOWING HER, I'M SURE
SHE'S ADAPTED JUST FINE.

62
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:25,958
I MEAN, THAT KINDA THING
IS HER STRONG SUIT.

63
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:28,458
IT ALWAYS HAS BEEN.

64
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:30,958
- WHY DON'T YOU GET OFF YOUR
BUTT AND VISIT HER SOMETIME?

65
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:34,166
- OH, NO, SHUT UP!
YOU CAN'T SAY THAT.

66
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,541
HE'LL DROP EVERYTHING HE'S DOING

67
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:38,000
AND GO RUNNING AFTER HER IF
YOU GIVE HIM PERMISSION.

68
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:41,041
- COME ON, GUYS, I WOULDN'T
BE ABLE TO GO ANYWAY.

69
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:43,708
I'M TOO BUSY. I DON'T HAVE TIME
TO BE RUNNING OUT OF TOWN.

70
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:45,208
- YOU WHAT?

71
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:46,958
- I ALREADY GOT ENOUGH
ON MY MIND TO WORRY ABOUT

72
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:48,041
WITH THE TEAM AND MY JOB

73
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:49,625
AND ALL OF THAT STUFF.

74
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:52,375
I DON'T HAVE ROOM TO THINK ABOUT
ANYTHING ELSE. MY PLATE'S FULL.

75
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,375
- I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING,

76
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:56,833
BUT IF YOU'RE GONNA KEEP SAYING
THINGS LIKE THAT, THEN...

77
00:04:56,916 --> 00:04:58,666
- YOU'LL JUST BE
KENJI THE SEQUEL.

78
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:02,000
- YEAH, AND YOU WON'T GET ANY
SYMPATHY FROM US WHEN YOU ARE.

79
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:04,416
- BETTER BELIEVE IT,
THE GUY'S GETTING OLD, MAN,

80
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,000
AND NOT A GIRLFRIEND IN SIGHT.

81
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:08,708
- YOU THINK YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY
LIVING THIS LONELY OF A LIFE,

82
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:09,833
JUST SWINGING BY THE GAS STATION

83
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:11,416
EVERY TIME YOUR DAY GETS
A LITTLE BORING?

84
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,208
- YOU TWO ARE THE LAST
PEOPLE ON EARTH

85
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:15,625
WHO SHOULD BE SPITTING
OUT CRAP LIKE THAT!

86
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:17,791
- Itsuki: KENJI!

87
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:19,416
- I SHOULD APOLOGIZE, I MEAN,

88
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,833
LIVING SUCH AN OFFENSIVE AND
LONELY LIFE WITH NO GIRLFRIEND.

89
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:27,375
WHAT JERKS. BEEN HEARING
A LOT ABOUT YOU TAKUMI.

90
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:29,750
THAT PROJECT D YOU'RE WITH
IS ROCKING OUT.

91
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:32,791
I SAW THE POSTING
OF YOUR LAST MATCH.

92
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:35,291
GAVE ME CHILLS.
SERIOUSLY, MAN, NICE WORK.

93
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:37,750
- NOWADAYS, TAKUMI
ALONG WITH KEISUKE TAKAHASHI

94
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:40,250
ARE THE TWIN STARS REPRESENTING
OUR FAIR GUNMA AREA.

95
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:42,083
THEY'RE ALMOST
LIKE SUPERHEROES.

96
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:44,541
- YOU GUYS ARE TOO GOOD.
WE'RE ALL REALLY IMPRESSED.

97
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:45,708
AREN'T BOTH OF YOU, LIKE,

98
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:47,666
INVINCIBLE NO MATTER
WHERE YOU GO?

99
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:50,250
- IT'S NOT LIKE EVERY WIN IS
EFFORTLESS. SEEMS LIKE EVERY

100
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:53,458
ONE IS BY THE SKIN OF OUR TEETH.
AND WHO KNOWS HOW TOUGH

101
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:57,375
THE NEXT SET OF GUYS WILL BE?
THAT'S THE PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE

102
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:58,458
TO FACE DOWN WEEK AFTER WEEK.

103
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:00,500
IT'S ACTUALLY KINDA
NERVE-WRACKING.

104
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:04,375
YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE
THE PRESSURE IT CAN PUT ON YOU.

105
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:07,041
- SO DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHO YOU'RE GONNA RACE NEXT?

106
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:08,708
OR DO THEY NOT
TELL YOU THAT STUFF?

107
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:12,083
- NO. THEY TELL ME.
THEY'RE CALLED THE TOUDOU.

108
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:14,500
I THINK
IT'S THE TOUDOU SCHOOL... .

109
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,666
- WHAT? YOU'RE RACING
THE TOUDOU SCHOOL?

110
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,708
- ARE THEY A BIG DEAL? WELL?

111
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:21,958
- YEAH. I'VE BEEN HEARING
ABOUT THEM FOR A LONG TIME NOW.

112
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:24,083
IT'S A TRAINING SCHOOL
FOR DRIVING TECHNIQUES.

113
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:26,750
THAT'S RUN BY A CAR SHOP OWNER
AND EX-RALLY DRIVER.

114
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:29,250
STARTED WITH ALL HIS YOUNG
CAR-LOVING CUSTOMERS,

115
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:30,916
THEN IT JUST
EXPLODED FROM THERE.

116
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,500
- IT'S A TRAINING SCHOOL
JUST FOR DRIVING TECHNIQUES?

117
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:35,708
IT'S EVEN KNOW
A THING LIKE THAT EXISTED.

118
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:38,125
- MMM-HMM. WHAT I HEAR IS
IT'S A GROUP OF STUBBORN RACERS

119
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:39,500
WHO ARE MORE INTERESTED
IN SPEED.

120
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:40,750
IT'S ALL THEY WANT.

121
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,625
THEY COULD CARE LESS ABOUT THAT
DRIFTING STYLE

122
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:44,833
THAT SEEMS TO BE SO
POPULAR WITH ALL YOU KIDS.

123
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:49,125
A LOT OF THOSE TOUDOU SCHOOL
ALUMS HAVE GONE PRO. AND WORD ON

124
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,916
THE STREET IS THAT PLENTY OF THE
GRADUATES ON THEIR TEAM

125
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,708
ARE ALREADY AT
SEMI-PRO STATUS.

126
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:57,750
- WHOA. NOT THE GROUP I'D
WANT TO BE GOING UP AGAINST.

127
00:06:57,833 --> 00:06:59,375
HOW ABOUT YOU?

128
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:11,333
- ( car tires squealing )

129
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:13,916
- TOUDOU, WHAT'S UP?
YOU WANTED TO SEE ME?

130
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,958
I HEARD THAT YOU NEEDED
TO TALK TO ME...

131
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:17,083
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

132
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:18,666
HEAR THERE'S AN OUTSIDE
TEAM COMING IN.

133
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,958
YOU PLANNING ON RACING
AGAINST 'EM, HUH?

134
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:23,666
- YEAH, PROJECT D.
I WAS HOPING TO.

135
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,333
- ALRIGHT. FOLLOW ME.

136
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,916
- TOUDOU, THIS CAR, IT'S...

137
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,291
- IT'S A DEMO MY SHOP USES.

138
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:36,750
DIDN'T KNOW IF YOU WANTED
IT FOR THE RACE.

139
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:38,458
- I APPRECIATE YOUR OFFER.

140
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:42,333
BUT, I THINK IT'S BETTER IF
I USE MY OWN CAR.

141
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:44,208
I MEAN, THE TOUDOU
COMPANY'S DEMO CAR

142
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:45,625
IS AN OVERWHELMING MONSTER.

143
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:48,000
I JUST DON'T THINK IT
WOULD BE MUCH OF A COMPETITION

144
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:49,500
IF I DROVE IT OUT THERE.

145
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:52,125
I WIN THE RACE IN THIS, I
WOULDN'T FEEL LIKE I'D DONE IT

146
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:53,666
WITH MY OWN SET OF SKILLS.

147
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:57,208
- C'MON, DON'T BE
SUCH A NAIVE KID!

148
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:59,750
LOOK, I DIDN'T MEAN TO BE SO
HARSH WITH YA. I JUST FIGURED

149
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:02,666
YOU'D TRY TO SAY SOMETHING
STUPID LIKE THAT.

150
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:05,916
WELL, IT DOESN'T MATTER. JUST
DO THINGS THE WAY YOU THINK THEY

151
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,125
SHOULD BE DONE. THE RACE IS
ONLY FOR FUN ANYWAY, RIGHT?

152
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:17,541
HEY, JUST DO YOUR BEST, OKAY?

153
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:21,583
IF I FEEL LIKE IT, MAYBE I'LL
DROP BY AND CHECK IT OUT.

154
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:22,958
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU DAIKI?

155
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:26,958
YOU'RE GONNA TURN DOWN
THAT OFFER? WHAT A WASTE.

156
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:28,375
IF IT WAS ME,

157
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:29,791
I'D ACCEPT WHAT THE CHIEF
DIRECTOR THROWS OUT THERE,

158
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:31,458
NO QUESTIONS ASKED.

159
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:36,916
- MAN, THIS CAR IS BEYOND
YOUR WILDEST DREAMS.

160
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,541
SERIOUSLY, I DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF YOU'D BE ABLE TO HANDLE IT.

161
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:42,458
- LOOK, I GET IT, SAKAI. YOU
CAN LET IT GO. I JUST THINK

162
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:44,958
USING YOUR OWN CAR IS A RULE
THAT PEOPLE SHOULD BE ABLE

163
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:47,125
TO HONOR ON THEIR OWN.

164
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:50,375
BESIDES MY EK'S BEEN TUNED-UP TO
THE POINT THAT THERE'S NO CHANCE

165
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:52,708
I'D LOSE TO
ANYONE IN A DOWNHILL.

166
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:55,208
- HEY, WHY DON'T YOU JUST
TRY TO RELAX ALREADY, DUDE?

167
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:57,625
I'VE HEARD OF PROJECT D TOO,

168
00:08:57,708 --> 00:08:59,291
BUT WE HAVE BEEN TRAINED BY
THE TOUDOU SCHOOL,

169
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:02,583
YOU KNOW? THESE SUCKERS
ARE PROBABLY SO WEAK WE'LL BE

170
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:04,666
DISAPPOINTED OVER IT FOR
THE NEXT MONTH ANYWAY.

171
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:08,583
- YEAH, I GUESS MAYBE YOU'RE
RIGHT, SAKAI, BUT I MEAN...

172
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:11,375
COME ON, DON'T THEY, PISS YOU
OFF EVEN A LITTLE BIT?

173
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:14,291
THE ALMIGHTY PROJECT D...

174
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:16,958
- LOOK, I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT
THE INTERNET OR HOMEPAGES...

175
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:19,083
BUT IT SEEMS LIKE ALL
THEIR POSTS ABOUT THEIR

176
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:21,666
ACCOMPLISHMENTS ARE
JUST PLAIN BRAGGING.

177
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:24,333
IT'S OBVIOUS THESE GUYS
ARE FULL OF THEMSELVES.

178
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:26,916
- YEAH, YOUR RIGHT...

179
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,625
- NOTHING GETS UNDER
MY SKIN MORE THAN PEOPLE

180
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:30,541
WITH ATTITUDES LIKE THAT.

181
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:32,166
I WANT TO SHOW THOSE PUNKS
THAT THE WORLD

182
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,416
IS FULL OF FAST DRIVERS.

183
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,708
THEY'RE NOT THE
ONLY ONES WHO CAN DO THIS.

184
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:39,375
- OF COURSE NOT. AND WITH THIS
EK NINE HERE, I'M SURE YOU'LL

185
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:42,083
HAVE NO PROBLEM SHOWING THEM
AS MANY TIMES AS YOU WANT...

186
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:43,208
- I'M GONNA.

187
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:48,250
- Fumihiro: RYOSUKE. I'VE BEEN
MEANING TO TALK TO YOU

188
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:50,083
ABOUT THIS FOR A WHILE...

189
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:52,916
WELL IT'S ABOUT THE HOMEPAGE WE
SET UP. DON'T YOU THINK MAYBE

190
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,666
IT'S JUST A LITTLE
TOO PROVOCATIVE?

191
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:55,833
- NO IT'S FINE.

192
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:58,041
- THAT'S JUST THE WAY
WE WANT IT TO BE.

193
00:09:58,125 --> 00:09:59,958
IT'S IMPORTANT WE'RE PERCEIVED
AS THE BAD GUYS.

194
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:03,333
WE WANT TO BE HATED BY THE
PEOPLE THAT WE'RE CHALLENGING.

195
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:04,583
- BUT IF WE DO ALL THAT...

196
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:06,750
- YES. OUR OPPONENTS WILL
GET ALL WORKED UP

197
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:09,000
AND GO AT US WITH EVERYTHING
THAT THEY'VE GOT.

198
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:12,708
THE TOUGHER THEY ARE THE
BETTER IT'LL BE FOR US.

199
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:15,583
IF OUR BACK'S NOT AGAINST THE
WALL, THEN THE BATTLE WON'T BE A

200
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:18,375
HARD ONE AND THERE'S NO POINT
TO IT. YOU KNOW THAT WINNING

201
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:21,250
BATTLES AND SETTING NEW COURSE
RECORDS ARE SOME OF PROJECT D'S

202
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:23,375
OBJECTIVES BUT THAT'S NOT ALL
THIS TEAM'S ABOUT.

203
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:26,125
FROM THE VERY MOMENT I STARTED
THIS WHOLE THING, I'VE HAD A

204
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,541
DIFFERENT PURPOSE IN MIND FOR
IT. THERE'S ANOTHER MEANING

205
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:30,083
HIDDEN WITHIN THE
"D" IN OUR NAME.

206
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:32,291
SOMETHING THAT NO ONE
KNOWS ABOUT BUT ME.

207
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:33,666
- HEY, HOLD ON A SECOND, MAN,

208
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,958
WHY HAVEN'T YOU EVER TALKED
TO ME ABOUT ANY OF THIS?

209
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:38,291
- IT'S NOTHING PERSONAL.
DON'T TAKE IT THAT WAY.

210
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:40,500
I HAVEN'T EXPLAINED
IT TO ANYONE YET.

211
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:42,166
AND I DON'T PLAN
TO FOR A WHILE.

212
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,458
- QUIT BEING SO
SECRETIVE RYOSUKE.

213
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:44,750
C'MON TELL ME WHAT'S UP.

214
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:47,916
WHAT DOES THE D STAND FOR
IN OUR TEAM'S NAME?

215
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,541
- YOU'LL FIND OUT EVENTUALLY
FUMIHIRO, LIKE EVERYONE.

216
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:52,458
- YEAH, BUT WHEN WILL
"EVENTUALLY" BE?

217
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:57,333
- Ryosuke: AROUND THE TIME
THE PROJECT IS COMPLETE.

218
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,958
- Fumihiro: THEY SAID THEY'LL
WITHDRAW THE LOCAL CARS.

219
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:36,291
I DON'T KNOW WHY

220
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:38,708
BUT IT'S LIKE THE COURSE
HAS BEEN RENTED OUT TO US.

221
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:41,333
- IT MIGHT SEEM LIKE THAT BUT WE
STILL HAVE REGULAR TRAFFIC

222
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:42,875
TO WORRY ABOUT DON'T WE?

223
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:45,208
- NO. THE ROAD'S STILL UNDER
CONSTRUCTION SO IT WON'T BE OPEN

224
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:47,083
TO REGULAR TRAFFIC FOR A WHILE.

225
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:48,791
APPARENTLY WE SHOULD
BE FREE AND CLEAR.

226
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,000
THE ONLY CARS ON THE
WHOLE MOUNTAIN

227
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:51,500
SHOULD BE OURS AND THEIRS.

228
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:53,375
- UNDER CONSTRUCTION...

229
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:54,833
- SO THAT'S WHY.

230
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:56,750
WHEN I SAW IT ON VIDEOTAPE
IT WAS AN AMAZING COURSE...

231
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:59,666
THERE ARE A WHOLE LOT
OF SHIFTS IN ELEVATION.

232
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:02,208
AND THE ROAD WINDS
AROUND QUITE A BIT.

233
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:05,125
IT MIGHT BE FRESHLY PAVED AND
WIDE ENOUGH FOR US TO DO THIS,

234
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:07,708
BUT THERE'RE PLENTY OF FALLEN
ROCKS SCATTERED AROUND.

235
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:09,125
IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW
YOU LOOK AT IT,

236
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:11,750
YOU COULDN'T SAY THIS ROAD HAS
A CLEAN SURFACE.

237
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:24,541
- KEISUKE!

238
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:26,625
- OH, YOU. WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE?

239
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:28,208
I THOUGHT YOU WERE BACK AT HOME.

240
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:31,333
- YOU DIDN'T EVEN NOTICE I CAME
ALONG? BUT, I'M THE DRIVER

241
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:32,875
FOR VAN TWO THIS TIME.

242
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:35,875
I THOUGHT YOU WOULD AT LEAST
KNOW WHO YOU WERE WORKING WITH.

243
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:43,125
LOOK, KEISUKE...

244
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:45,666
ONCE YOU'RE DONE GEARING UP YOUR
CAR, COULD YOU PLEASE TAKE ME

245
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,958
FOR ONE RIDE SHOTGUN. JUST ONE.
I REALLY NEED IT.

246
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:49,166
I JUST WANNA LEARN MORE

247
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,083
BY WATCHING YOUR DRIVING
TECHNIQUE UP CLOSE.

248
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:52,416
I REALLY THINK IT'LL HELP.

249
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,958
- I DON'T KNOW KID.
DOUBT WE'LL HAVE ENOUGH TIME

250
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:57,916
BEFORE THIS WHOLE SONG AND
DANCE GEARS UP.

251
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,708
- THIS RACE IS REALLY GONNA BE
TRICKY. I NEED TO CONCENTRATE.

252
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:02,708
- ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT IT?

253
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:05,208
- KENTA, OPEN YOUR EYES.
HAVEN'T YOU NOTICED ANYTHING?

254
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:17,791
- ALRIGHT, WE'RE ALL SET.

255
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:21,250
- LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE READY
TO ROLL, KEISUKE.

256
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:22,375
- COOL.

257
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,333
- WE SHOULD GO, TOO.

258
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:29,791
- OKAY.

IT'S STARTING TO CREEP ME OUT.

267
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,625
THIS WHOLE THING ABOUT LETTING
US HAVE TOTAL RUN OF THE COURSE,

268
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:15,166
LIKE THEY'RE NOT EVEN CONCERNED.

269
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,583
EVEN I'M BEGINNING TO
FEEL THE PRESSURE

270
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:18,250
STARTING TO
BUILD UP AGAINST US.

271
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:21,333
I WANNA KNOW HOW THESE TOUDOU
SCHOOL PEOPLE DRIVE.

272
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:22,708
- Ryosuke: YOU SHOULD HAVE
A PRETTY GOOD IDEA

273
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:24,458
HOW THEY DRIVE IF I TELL

274
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:25,625
YOU KYOICHI SUDO
OF "THE EMPERORS"

275
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:27,416
USED TO BE ONE OF THEM.

276
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,375
THEIR WHOLE TEAM IS TOUGH
TALKING VETS, JUST LIKE HIM.

277
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:32,791
- IT'S JUST A BUNCH OF GUYS
JUST AS GOOD AS KYOICHI?

278
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:35,416
LOOK, WE DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS,
RYOSUKE. I MEAN PROJECT D

279
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,083
DOESN'T EXACTLY HAVE A LOT OF
RACES UNDER ITS BELT YET.

280
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:40,666
MAYBE WE SHOULD PUT THIS ONE ON
HOLD AND RACE THEM LATER?

281
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:44,208
- NO. IF WE CAN BE DEFEATED BY A
TEAM LIKE THIS, THEN THERE'S

282
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:47,666
NOT A CHANCE WE'LL EVER SURVIVE
THOSE FUTURE BATTLES.

283
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,833
WE'LL FIGURE OUT OUR TRUE
WORTH HERE, ON THIS RUN,

284
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:51,500
IN THIS BATTLE.

285
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:53,916
BY THE END, WE'LL HAVE
CRUSHED THE TODO SCHOOL

286
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,666
INTO THE ASPHALT.

287
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:06,750
- PROJECT D. THEY WERE WAY
MORE TOGETHER THAN I EXPECTED,

288
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:08,708
GOTTA GIVE 'EM THAT.

289
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:11,041
- HONESTLY, I WAS IMPRESSED.
MAYBE I SHOULDN'T SAY IT.

290
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:14,000
BUT YEAH, EVEN THE COMPOSITION
OF THEIR TEAM MADE SENSE.

291
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:16,208
- YEAH, GOOD POINT.

292
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:18,041
THEY BROUGHT THREE VANS FULL
OF PARTS AND TIRES.

293
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:20,708
I GOTTA ADMIT, THAT'S A
PRETTY SMART MOVE.

294
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:23,208
- BOTH THE FD AND THE EIGHT-SIX
EACH HAD THEIR OWN PERSONAL

295
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:27,000
MECHANICS AND THOSE GUYS WORKED
FAST, MAN. I MEAN REALLY FAST...

296
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:29,666
THOSE DUDES HAD SOME SERIOUS
SKILLS IF YOU ASKED ME...

297
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,166
- IT'S GOTTA BE A
PRETTY CLEVER GUY

298
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,208
PULLING ALL THESE GREASE
MONKEY'S STRINGS.

299
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:36,083
- EVERYTHING I'VE SEEN SO FAR
TELLS ME THESE DRIVERS COULD BE

300
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:38,916
BETTER THAN WE THOUGHT. UNTIL
YESTERDAY I WASN'T EXPECTING

301
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,083
MUCH MORE THAN THEM SHOWING UP
AND LOOKING SCARED.

302
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:42,166
- WELL, I'M JUST LOOKING FORWARD

303
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,291
TO RACING ANOTHER TEAM
FOR A CHANGE.

304
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:46,958
IT'S ALWAYS TOO COMPETITIVE
WHEN WE RACE EACH OTHER ANYWAY.

305
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:48,833
IT KINDA SUCKS ALL THE FUN
RIGHT OUT OF THE WHOLE THING.

306
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:50,166
- NOT TO MENTION,

307
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,833
CHIEF TOUDOU'S ALWAYS ON
OUR CASES FOR EVERYTHING.

308
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:54,625
CAN'T MAKE ANY
MISTAKES. YOU STOP PAYING

309
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:57,208
ATTENTION FOR ONE SECOND AND
HE'S THERE TO SCREAM AT YOU.

310
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:59,791
- YEAH. AND COMPARED TO OUR
RACES AGAINST EACH OTHER, THE

311
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:02,458
ONE TOMORROW NIGHT'LL BE A PIECE
OF FREAKIN' CAKE. KINDA MAKES

312
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:05,166
ME WISH I WAS OUT THERE RACING.
SO WHY DON'T I JUST DO THAT?

313
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,875
- YEAH, ME TOO. I WANNA RACE!

314
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:08,208
- GIMME A BREAK, YOU GUYS.

315
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:09,916
DON'TCHA THINK YOU'RE A BIT
OUTTA THEIR LEAGUE?

316
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,541
I THINK IT WOULD BE BEST IF ALL
THE GRADUATE DRIVERS SAT THIS

317
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:15,083
ONE OUT. AND WE SHOULD LEAVE
IT TO THE CURRENT STUDENTS IN

318
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:18,125
THE INTEREST OF
FAIRNESS TO BOTH TEAMS.

319
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:21,208
DAIKI'S EK WILL RACE DOWNHILL.

320
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:23,833
AND MY INTEGRA TURBO WILL
TAKE THE UPHILL.

321
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:26,708
- WELL, I GUESS THAT'S
THE WAY IT IS...

322
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:30,166
- BUT IF YOU TWO LOSE, WE'RE
NEVER GONNA LET YOU FORGET IT.

323
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:33,208
YOU'LL BE DISHONORING THE NAME
OF THE TOUDOU SCHOOL.

324
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:35,083
AND YOU'LL BE DISHONORING US.

325
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:37,541
- YEAH. AND IF YOU LOSE,
WE'RE GONNA PENALIZE YOU,

326
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:38,666
WITH LIKE A MILLION YEN.

327
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,250
WHAT'DDAYA THINK ABOUT THAT?

328
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:43,375
- WAIT, A MILLION YEN?
- THAT SOUNDS PRETTY ROUGH.

329
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:46,000
- IF THIS IS A JOKE,
IT'S NOT FUNNY, YOU GUYS.

330
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:48,625
- ( all laughing )

331
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:53,041
- ( car engine echoing )

332
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:07,666
- OIL PRESSURE'S STABLE. HOW
ARE THE TIRES WORKIN' OUT THERE?

333
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:10,500
- THEY'RE HOLDING TIGHT TO THE
ROAD. I CAN REALLY LET HER OUT.

334
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:13,041
I'M GONNA TAKE FIVE, THEN I'LL
RUN THE COURSE TWO OR THREE MORE

335
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:15,416
TIMES WITH THESE SETTINGS.
AFTER THAT, I'M DONE.

336
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,916
- SURE.

337
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,208
- YOU KNOW, THIS ROAD TWISTS
AND TURNS LIKE A GRAPEVINE.

338
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:21,708
THAT DOWNHILL IS GONNA
BE ONE INTENSE RIDE.

339
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,166
- I CHANGED THE BRAKE
PADS YOU HAD

340
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,750
TO MORE DURABLE ONES.

341
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:27,375
IT'LL COST YOU A BIT OF CONTROL
AT FIRST, SO KEEP THAT IN MIND.

342
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:29,125
I DON'T WANT YOU
SLIPPING OUT THERE OK?

343
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:31,833
- THANKS, MATSUMOTO. TIME TO SEE
WHAT THIS COURSE HAS TO OFFER.

344
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:33,500
- BRING HER BACK AFTER
ABOUT FIVE RUNS.

345
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:34,916
I WANT TO CHECK ON THOSE

346
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,083
PADS AND MAKE SURE THEY'RE
NOT GETTING STICKY ON YOU.

347
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:38,208
- OKAY.

348
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:50,625
- RYOSUKE LOOKS DIFFERENT.
BUT SO DOES EVERYONE ELSE.

349
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:53,541
WHAT IS THIS FEELING THAT'S
HANGING OVER EVERYTHING?

350
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:54,875
I NEVER FELT ANYTHING LIKE THIS

351
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:57,000
DURING THE RED SUN'S
EXPEDITION BATTLES.

352
00:17:57,083 --> 00:17:59,625
IT'S LIKE SOMETHING AMAZING
IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN HERE.

353
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:03,333
I'M GETTING NERVOUS.
I ALMOST WANT TO RUN AWAY.

354
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:09,166
- I WONDER IF THE FIRST STEP TO
BEING A DRIVER FOR PROJECT D IS

355
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,666
BEING ABLE TO WITHSTAND
THIS KIND OF TENSION.

356
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:17,291
- IKETANI! ITSUKI!

357
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:18,666
THE BIG RACE IS TONIGHT!

358
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:21,375
PROJECT D'S GONNA TAKE ON
THE TOUDOU SCHOOL!

359
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:23,666
- WOW. YOU REALLY
DON'T HAVE A LIFE, DO YOU?

360
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:26,291
- DUDE. DOESN'T THIS GET YOU
EXCITED? AREN'T YOU EVEN THE

361
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:29,666
SLIGHTEST BIT CURIOUS ABOUT
HOW TAKUMI'S GONNA DO?

362
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,833
- SURE. BUT I'M NOT
SHUTTING DOWN MY LIFE

363
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:34,083
AND HAULING TO TOCHIGI
JUST TO WATCH A RACE.

364
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:36,666
- HEY, WHY DON'T YOU JUST GO
WATCH IT BY YOURSELF, KENJI?

365
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,666
NOT LIKE YOU HAVE
ANYTHING ELSE TO DO.

366
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,833
- ENOUGH! QUIT TALKING ABOUT
HOW I HAVE NO GIRLFRIEND,

367
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:42,166
YOU GOT IT?

368
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:43,708
- I NEVER MENTIONED IF YOU
HAD A GIRLFRIEND OR NOT,

369
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:44,500
YOU FREAKIN' PSYCHOPATH.

370
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:45,916
GIMME A BREAK ALREADY!

371
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,666
- Kenji: YOU JUST SAID IT!
I HEARD YOU!

372
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,791
- Iketani: YOU HEARD THE
VOICES IN YOUR HEAD!

373
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:51,666
- SO TONIGHT THE NIGHT. BUT
THESE GUYS FROM THE SCHOOL

374
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,791
MIGHT BE TOUGHER THAN WE THINK.

375
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,708
- Fumihiro: FINALLY, LOOKS
LIKE THE SUN'S SETTING.

376
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:05,708
I SLEPT LIKE HELL LAST NIGHT.

377
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:09,375
THE DAY FELT LIKE IT LASTED
A YEAR. I WONDER WHY THE

378
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:12,500
ATMOSPHERE AROUND
HERE IS SO STIFLING...

379
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:15,000
I GUESS MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE I
DIDN'T SEE ANY OF THE LOCAL

380
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:17,500
DRIVERS ON THAT COURSE LAST
NIGHT, NOT ONE TIME.

381
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:19,083
IT'S LIKE THEY DIDN'T CARE.

382
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:21,083
IT BOTHERS ME NOT BEING
ABLE TO SEE WHAT MY

383
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:22,500
OPPONENT IS MADE OF.

384
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:24,875
- WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO
DIG UP ANY DATA ON 'EM.

385
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:26,041
- Fumihiro: YEAH, EXACTLY.

386
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:28,208
THEY HAVEN'T BOTHERED TO
CHECK UP ON HOW WE

387
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:31,625
DRIVE EITHER. THAT GIVES ME A
BAD FEELING ABOUT THIS, OR WHO

388
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:34,500
KNOWS, MAYBE I'M
THINKING TOO MUCH.

389
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:36,416
- AT ANY RATE, THIS JUST
SHOWS HOW MUCH CONFIDENCE

390
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,166
THEY HAVE IN THEMSELVES.

391
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,958
NOT EVEN BACK IN MY DAYS WITH
THE RED SUNS DID ANYONE SEEM TO

392
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:43,583
BLOW US OFF AS MUCH AS THESE
GUYS ARE DOING RIGHT NOW.

393
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:46,125
- YOU KNOW FUMIHIRO, YOU CAN GET
BENT OUTTA SHAPE IF YOU WANT,

394
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:48,041
BUT THAT KINDA STUFF
NEVER BOTHERED ME.

395
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:50,041
- HUH?

396
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:52,250
- BEFORE I JOINED THIS TEAM,
I DROVE AGAINST A BUNCH OF

397
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:54,291
DIFFERENT PEOPLE AND THEY ALWAYS
TREATED ME EXACTLY LIKE THIS.

398
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:55,875
I'M USED TO IT.

399
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:58,166
I CONCENTRATE BETTER WHEN I
DON'T KNOW MY OPPONENT I LIKE

400
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:01,166
IT WHEN IT'S A STRANGER
IN THE OTHER CAR.

401
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:03,916
PUSH ALL THE UNNECESSARY
THOUGHTS OUT OF YOUR HEAD AND

402
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,625
JUST FOCUS ON DRIVING
AS FAST AS YOU CAN

403
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:07,458
ON THE ROAD IN FRONT OF YOU.

404
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:10,708
I'M HAVING A LOT OF FUN.
I CAN'T HELP IT.

405
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:12,458
- YOU SERIOUS?

406
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:15,166
- I DON'T KNOW ANY OTHER WAY TO
EXPLAIN IT. I JUST CAN'T THINK

407
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,666
OF ANYTHING I LIKE MORE.
THERE'S NOTHING BETTER.

408
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,666
- I SEE. PUT IT LIKE THAT,

409
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,666
AND I GUESS THAT'S THE
WAY YOU'VE ALWAYS RACED.

410
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,791
- GOOD POINT.

411
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:26,916
- AMAZING. I CAN'T
BELIEVE HE CAN RELAX

412
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,083
AND ENJOY THIS SITUATION
AS MUCH AS HE IS.

413
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:31,958
FUJIWARA'S ON A LEVEL
TOTALLY DIFFERENT

414
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:34,666
FROM RYOSUKE OR KEISUKE.

415
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:38,708
AKINA'S EIGHT-SIX,
TAKUMI FUJIWARA.

416
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:40,375
AND NOW THAT WE'RE BOTH HERE,

417
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:43,666
THERE'S NO POINT IN
STIRRING UP ANY TROUBLE.

418
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:46,500
I THINK THE BEST THING WE CAN
DO, IS TO STAND BEHIND THE

419
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:49,083
DOWNHILL DRIVER
THAT RYOSUKE'S CHOSEN.

420
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,250
- IS THAT YOU, DAIKI?

421
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:58,166
- I WANNA RUN A QUICK CHECK ON
MY BRAKES. DO YOU MIND IF I

422
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,458
BORROW A JACK AND A
WRENCH FOR A FEW MINUTES?

423
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:01,958
- THAT'S COOL.

424
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:03,875
SO, IS THIS PART THE RITUAL OF
"FINAL CHECK PREPARATION"

425
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:05,666
BEFORE TONIGHT'S BIG RACE?

426
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,916
- NOW YOU KNOW I'VE NEVER BEEN
INTO THAT KINDA BS.

427
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,291
- ( sighs )

428
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:10,916
- TO BE HONEST WITH
YOU I CAN'T GET

429
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,500
PUMPED UP FOR THIS ONE, SAKAI.

430
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:15,041
FOR SOME REASON I
JUST CAN'T GET INTO THIS BATTLE.

431
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:17,166
- YEAH, I COULD TELL
SOMETHING WAS WRONG.

432
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:19,708
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN ACTING LIKE
YOURSELF SINCE YESTERDAY.

433
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:22,041
IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH YOUR
OPPONENT'S CAR, RIGHT?

434
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:23,750
- DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS SO OBVIOUS.

435
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:25,291
BUT OF COURSE YOU'D
BE ABLE TO TELL.

436
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:28,166
OUT OF ALL THE CARS TO
GO UP AGAINST, AN EIGHT-SIX!

437
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:30,708
TO CHASE AFTER A WIND-UP TOY
LIKE THAT AND LEAVE IT IN THE

438
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:33,291
DUST-IT'S LIKE BEATING
UP A LITTLE KID.

439
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:34,958
- ( laughs )

440
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:37,500
- ONCE I SAW THAT CAR LAST
NIGHT, I'VE FELT BAD EVER SINCE.

441
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:40,875
I DON'T CARE IF THE DRIVER'S THE
BEST IN THE WORLD, I CAN'T FIND

442
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:44,250
ANYTHING THAT EXCITES
ME ABOUT THIS RACE.

443
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:47,333
THIS WHOLE THING WOULD BE A LOT
BETTER IF I WAS RACING THE FD.

444
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:50,208
- SO YOU'LL EMBARRASS HIM. BIG
DEAL. YOU'VE GOTTA STOP BEING

445
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:52,083
SO PARTICULAR. EVERYONE
KNOWS THAT IT DOESN'T MATTER

446
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:53,833
WHAT CAR YOU'RE RACING AGAINST.

447
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:56,791
NO CAR IS EVER GONNA BEAT
YOU IN A DOWNHILL RACE.

448
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:01,125
NOW CHANGE THAT LOCKED-UP WAY
YOU'VE BEEN THINKING AND SHOW

449
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:03,333
THESE JERKS THE DIFFERENCE
IN YOUR SKILLS.

450
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:06,166
THEY'RE THE ONES WHO PICKED THE
FIGHT, PAL. REMEMBER THAT.

451
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:09,083
THERE'S NO REASON FOR US
TO HOLD BACK AT ALL.

452
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:11,958
EVEN IF YOUR OPPONENT IS A
PATHETIC, LITTLE EIGHT-SIX.

453
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,666
- I'M TAKUMI FUJIWARA.

454
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:27,291
- I'M DAIKI NINOMIYA.

455
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:32,666
HE'S SO YOUNG. THIS IS PROJECT
D'S DOWNHILL RACER?

456
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:35,125
- WE WANNA RUN THE RACE IN
THE LEADER/CHASER FASHION

457
00:22:35,208 --> 00:22:36,500
IF IT'S ALRIGHT BY YOU.

458
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:38,166
IT'S YOUR TRACK SO YOU GUYS
CAN CHOOSE YOUR POSITION

459
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:39,333
FOR THE FIRST RUN.

460
00:22:39,416 --> 00:22:40,833
- YOU THINK THAT THROUGH?

461
00:22:40,916 --> 00:22:43,166
WE'RE ALREADY GOT THE ADVANTAGE
BEING THE HOME TEAM HERE.

462
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:44,875
- YEAH, BUT THIS IS HOW WE'D
PREFER TO DO THINGS

463
00:22:44,958 --> 00:22:46,958
WHEN WE'RE THE AWAY TEAM.

464
00:22:47,041 --> 00:22:48,583
- YOU GUYS ARE PRETTY
CONFIDENT, AREN'T YOU?

465
00:22:48,666 --> 00:22:50,125
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT,

466
00:22:50,208 --> 00:22:53,833
THEN I'LL BE THE ONE CHASING.
SWITCH UP ON THE SECOND RUN.

467
00:22:53,916 --> 00:22:57,583
- GOOD. THEN WE SHOULD GO
AHEAD AND START THE RACE.

468
00:22:57,666 --> 00:23:00,291
- ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE OKAY BEING
THE CHASER? YOU'D JUST FINISH

469
00:23:00,375 --> 00:23:02,916
THE RACE ALL THAT MUCH SOONER IF
YOU TOOK THE LEADER SLOT.

470
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,500
- YOU MAY BE RIGHT. BUT
SOMETHING'S BEEN NAGGING AT ME.

471
00:23:14,041 --> 00:23:16,041
- YOU GET IT, RIGHT?

472
00:23:16,125 --> 00:23:19,500
THIS GUY IS NOT GONNA BE AS EASY
AN OPPONENT AS WE THOUGHT.

473
00:23:22,166 --> 00:23:25,833
- SO, THEY'RE GONNA BE CHASING
FOR THE FIRST RUN? ALRIGHT...

474
00:23:25,916 --> 00:23:28,666
COULDJA HAND THE PHONE
OVER TO TAKUMI?

475
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,791
- FUJIWARA, IT'S RYOSUKE.

476
00:23:31,375 --> 00:23:33,375
- WHAT'S UP?

477
00:23:33,458 --> 00:23:35,791
- TAKUMI, IT'S IMPORTANT
THAT YOU LISTEN

478
00:23:35,875 --> 00:23:38,500
I HAVE TWO BASIC
INSTRUCTIONS FOR YOU.

479
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:41,958
- Takumi: OKAY. OKAY.

480
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:43,791
SURE, I UNDERSTAND.

481
00:23:48,416 --> 00:23:50,291
- WE'RE COUNTING ON YOU, MAN.

482
00:23:50,375 --> 00:23:51,791
- I HOPE I CAN DO IT...

483
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:54,875
THIS GUY'S AN INCREDIBLE DRIVER.

484
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:59,916
I CAN SENSE IT. IT'S LIKE I
CAN SEE HOW FAST HE IS.

485
00:24:07,375 --> 00:24:08,791
HE'S AMAZING.

486
00:24:10,375 --> 00:24:12,416
- ( car engine revving )

487
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:18,125
- Fumihiro: YOU BOTH
START OFF SLOW

488
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:19,541
AND THEN AFTER THE FIRST
CORNER, YOU CAN

489
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:21,666
KICK IT INTO FULL SPEED
AND GIVE IT ALL SHE'S GOT.

490
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:23,375
THE EIGHT-SIX IS STARTING
OFF FIRST.

491
00:24:23,458 --> 00:24:25,250
SO YOU JUST HAVE TO
STAY BEHIND IT.

492
00:24:25,333 --> 00:24:26,708
- I GOT IT.

493
00:24:29,041 --> 00:24:31,208
- ( revving engine )

494
00:24:36,458 --> 00:24:39,208
- THAT EIGHT-SIX'S DRIVER SEEMS
LIKE HE'S GOT MORE TO GIVE THAT

495
00:24:39,291 --> 00:24:41,916
I WAS GIVING HIM CREDIT FOR.

496
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,875
THERE'S ONLY ONE REASON I CHOSE
TO BE THE CHASER FOR THE FIRST

497
00:24:44,958 --> 00:24:49,125
RUN, I HAVE TO KNOW.
WHY DOES HE DRIVE AN EIGHT-SIX?

498
00:24:49,208 --> 00:24:52,291
I MEAN, WHAT CAN HE POSSIBLY
DO IN A SCRAP-HEAP LIKE THAT?

499
00:24:54,291 --> 00:24:56,291
SHOW ME WHAT YOU'VE GOT.

500
00:24:56,375 --> 00:24:58,166
- ( revving engine )

501
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:04,333
- HERE WE GO! LET'S DO THIS!

502
00:25:04,416 --> 00:25:05,916
- ALRIGHT, THEY'RE STARTING UP!

503
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,208
- IT'S ABOUT TIME THIS
DOWNHILL GOT GOING'.

504
00:25:08,291 --> 00:25:11,666
- HEY, CAN YOU HEAR ME? YEAH,
THEY'RE ABOUT TO START!

505
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:14,250
- IT'S TIME TO FIND OUT WHAT
PROJECT D IS REALLY MADE OF.

506
