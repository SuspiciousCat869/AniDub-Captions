JUST A K, RIGHT?

14
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:47,041
A CAR LIKE THAT'S A JOKE.

00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,041
WHO DO THESE GUYS
THINK THEY'RE RACIN'?

16
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:52,500
- YOU KIDDIN' ME? YOU REALLY
DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE UP TO?

17
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:53,833
A LOTTA FOLKS SAID
THE SAME THING

18
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:56,291
ABOUT TAKUMI'S
EIGHT-SIX LAST YEAR.

19
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:58,375
EVERYBODY IN GUNMA
THOUGHT HE WAS A JOKE.

20
00:02:58,458 --> 00:02:59,791
HOW MANY OF THOSE
PEOPLE YOU THINK

21
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:01,708
ARE EATIN' THEIR WORDS NOW?

22
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:03,833
AN EIGHT-SIX DOESN'T HAVE CRAP
FOR TORQUE.

23
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:06,958
BUT BEFORE WE KNEW IT THAT THING
HANDED ALL OF US OUR ASSES.

24
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:09,958
THE NIGHT KIDS, THE RED SUNS,
PROJECT D.

00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:15,583
I'LL TELL YOU WHO THESE GUYS
THINK THEY'RE RACIN'.

26
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:17,250
SOMEONE THEY CAN BEAT.

27

29
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:50,708
BRING YOUR OWN
RAIN-MACHINE, TOO?

30
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:51,958
- OH, COME OFF IT, MAN.

31
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:53,541
THAT LITTLE BEAUTY'S GOT
THE EDGE IN THIS RACE

32
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:55,083
AND YOU KNOW IT.

33
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,500
- YEAH, WELL...

34
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:02,708
- YEAH, WELL, NOTHIN'.
THE BIG BAD D'S GONNA LOSE.

35
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:04,750
YOU WON'T SEE ME MARCHIN'
AROUND LIKE A CHAMPION

36
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:05,583
AFTER THIS, THOUGH.

37
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:08,750
I CAN PROMISE YOU THAT MUCH.

38
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:10,375
JUST BETWEEN THE TWO OF US,

39
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,291
SEEIN' YOUR BOY GETTING HIS
ASS HANDED TO HIM

40
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:14,750
BY A CAR LIKE THAT
MAKES ME FRIGGIN' SICK,

41
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:16,250
IT'S A DAMN TRAVESTY.

42
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:18,708
- YOU KNOW, YOU KEEP TALKIN'
LIKE IT'S ALL SAID AND DONE.

43
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:21,541
BUT YOU'VE RACED AGAINST HIM,
YOU KNOW WHAT HE'S CAPABLE OF.

44
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:23,625
- I DO, YEAH. AND
I'M TELLIN' YOU

45
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:26,041
HE DOESN'T HAVE A
SNOWBALL'S CHANCE IN HELL.

46
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:28,791
- AND I'M TELLIN' YOU
YOU'RE FULL OF CRAP.

47
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:30,833
GRANTED, IF YOU LOOK AT
IT AS CAR VS. CAR,

48
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:32,416
THEN YEAH, THE
EIGHT-SIX IS TOAST.

49
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:36,166
I'LL GIVE YOU THAT. BUT THERE'S
A FLESH-N'-BLOOD HUMAN BEING

50
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,416
BEHIND THE WHEEL OF
THAT EIGHT-SIX.

51
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,083
AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS RACE
AS DRIVER VS. DRIVER,

52
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:42,583
ALL BETS ARE OFF.

53
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:44,000
- SO WHAT?

54
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:45,625
YOU THINK WE CHERRY-PICKED
A DRIVER WHO'S GONNA SUCK?

55
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:48,791
SAKAMOTO'S A FREAK OF NATURE.
TAKE MY WORD FOR IT.

56
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:50,791
- YOU'RE MISSING
THE POINT, DUDE.

57
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:52,541
I KNOW YOUR GUY'S GOTTA BE GOOD.

58
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:57,666
HE MIGHT EVEN BE A FREAK OF
NATURE LIKE YOU SAY, BUT...

59
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,208
WELL, LET ME PUT IT TO YOU
LIKE THIS,

60
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:00,500
EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE
PROBABLY GONNA THINK

61
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:02,583
I'M JUST BLOWIN'
SMOKE UP YOUR ASS.

62
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:04,208
THEY HAVEN'T INVENTED
THE WORD YET

63
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:07,208
TO DESCRIBE WHATEVER
THE HELL TAKUMI IS.

64
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:12,708
NOTHING'S EVER WRITTEN IN STONE.

65
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:15,625
IF YOU'VE DRIVEN WITH HIM
YOU OUGHTA KNOW THAT.

66
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:17,416
THIS AIN'T OVER YET.

67
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:28,416
- Itsuki: AH, MAN,
THIS RAIN SUCKS!

68
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,458
I'M GETTIN' DRENCHED
TO THE BONE.

69
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:32,750
- Iketani: STOP BEING
A TITTY-BABY, WILL YA?

70
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:36,041
TAKUMI'S THE ONE HAVING TO RACE
IN THIS CRAP, NOT YOU.

71
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:38,750
I GOTTA ADMIT, THOUGH,
THE THOUGHT OF A DOWNHILL RACE

72
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:40,541
IN WEATHER LIKE THIS
MAKES ME CRINGE.

73
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:43,750
- JUST WHAT I THOUGHT!
HAVE YOU TWO NO FAITH AT ALL?

74
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:46,416
MAYBE YOUR KNEES LOCK
AT THE IDEA OF A LITTLE RAIN,

75
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,958
BUT DON'T FORGET WE'RE
TALKIN' ABOUT THE GUY

76
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:50,000
WHO KICKED BUTT ON MYOGI! HA-HA!

77
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:52,541
- WELL, YOU DO HAVE
A POINT THERE, I SUPPOSE.

78
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:55,458
- WELL, OF COURSE I DO! I'VE
EXPERIENCED HIS GODLIKE POWERS

79
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:57,875
FIRSTHAND, HAVEN'T I? ( laughs )

80
00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:00,416
WHEN YOU GET DOWN TO IT, I'M
SURPRISED THE RAIN EVEN BOTHERS

81
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,583
TO FALL IN THE FIRST PLACE.

82
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:07,416
- ( engine revving )

83
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:11,625
- ( tires screeching )

84
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:26,333
- Nobuhiko: WHICH DO YOU PREFER?
LEADING OR CHASING?

85
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:27,625
- Sakamoto: WHAT DO YOU THINK?

86
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:29,416
LEAD CAR'S UNDER MORE PRESSURE
TO SET THE PACE,

87
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,166
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S RAINING
LIKE THIS.

88
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,625
I MEAN, THERE'S NO
POINT IN DOING THIS

89
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:36,375
IF IT'S GONNA BE EASY, RIGHT?

90
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:39,041
CHASING ISN'T EXACTLY
WHAT YOU'D CALL OUR STYLE.

91
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:41,750
BESIDES, I DON'T WANNA TAKE
ALL NIGHT.

92
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:44,000
I'M GONNA END IT
BY THE FIRST RUN.

93
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:47,916
- THAT'S WHAT I LIKE TO HEAR.
OKAY THEN. YOU LEAD.

94
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,125
BUT END IT QUICKLY.

95
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:01,500
- YOU'LL SEE FOR YOURSELF
ONCE THE RACE STARTS,

96
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:03,208
THAT PINK MONSTROSITY
IN FRONT OF YOU

97
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:06,041
IS IN FACT LUDICROUSLY FAST.

98
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:07,333
IT'LL DUST YOU ON THE CORNERS,

99
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:10,250
SO TRY TO COMPENSATE ON
THE STRAIGHTAWAYS.

100
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:12,125
DON'T MAKE THE MISTAKE
OF THINKING THIS RACE'LL

101
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:14,250
BE LIKE ANY OF THE
OTHERS YOU'VE RUN.

102
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:16,125
- ( engines revving )

103
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:26,333
- HERE'S SOME ADVICE FOR YOU.

104
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:28,583
IMAGINE THE MOST DIFFICULT
SITUATION YOU'VE BEEN IN

105
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:30,000
BEHIND THE WHEEL OF THAT CAR

106
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,625
AND INVERT IT. TO WIN
THIS THING YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO

107
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:33,333
TURN THE GOLDEN
RULE ON ITS HEAD

108
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:35,958
AND DO UNTO OTHERS
WHAT'S BEEN DONE TO YOU.

109
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:39,916
THINK ABOUT KYOICHI SUDOU.
HE AND THE EMPERORS.

110
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,708
HOW DO YOU THINK THEY COPE WITH
MESSY CONDITIONS LIKE THESE?

111
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:45,250
THAT'LL BE THE KEY
TO YOUR STRATEGY.

112
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:46,583
AND BEAR IN MIND THE POINT HERE

113
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:49,083
IS TO DO THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT
YOU'D NORMALLY DO.

114
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:52,125
EVERYTHING YOU KNOW HAS TO
BE LOOKED AT IN REVERSE.

115
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,125
- Matsumoto: IS IT JUST ME,
OR ARE YOU CHANGING THE WAY

116
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:20,791
YOU GIVE TAKUMI ADVICE?

117
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,875
SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE GETTIN' A
LITTLE ABSTRACT WITH HIM LATELY.

118
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:25,416
- YOU REALLY THINK SO?

119
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,750
- YEAH, I DO. I MEAN,

120
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:28,416
UP TILL RECENTLY WHENEVER
YOU GAVE HIM POINTERS

121
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,458
YOU'D LAY IT OUT LIKE
AN INSTRUCTION MANUAL.

122
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:34,666
"DO THIS, DO THAT."
YOU KNOW, REAL SPECIFIC STUFF,

123
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,208
BUT TONIGHT, I GUESS... I DUNNO.

124
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:38,291
YOU KINDA POSED IT
LIKE A RIDDLE.

125
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:40,416
DON'T GET ME WRONG,
THAT'S A GOOD THING.

126
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,708
INSTEAD OF JUST HAVING
IT SPELLED OUT,

127
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:44,291
HE'S GOTTA USE THE OLD
NOGGIN FOR HIMSELF.

128
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:50,708
- I GUESS THAT JUST GOES TO SHOW
HOW MUCH TAKUMI'S GROWN LATELY.

129
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:52,916
SEE, IT'S BEEN MY AIM TO TRY
AND SET UP THESE RACES

130
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,458
SO THAT HE AND KEISUKE FACE
SOMETHING A LITTLE DIFFERENT,

131
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:58,708
A LITTLE MORE CHALLENGING,
EACH TIME OUT.

132
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:01,041
- I SUSPECTED
THAT MIGHT BE THE IDEA.

133
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:03,083
YOU'RE FORCING THEM TO MATURE.

134
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:05,875
AND MAYBE IT'S PATTING MY OWN
BACK AS MUCH AS YOURS TO SAY IT,

135
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:08,208
BUT PROJECT D'S
DONE 'EM SOME GOOD.

136
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:09,708
- I HOPE SO.

137
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:12,833
I MIGHT'VE GONE A LITTLE
OVERBOARD TONIGHT, THOUGH.

138
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:14,208
WHEN YOU'RE COMPETING,

139
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:16,791
YOU HAVE TO TAKE A HELLUVA
LOT OF CHANCES.

140
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:18,708
YOU SAY I WAS
A LITTLE BIT ABSTRACT.

141
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:21,750
I SAY I MIGHT'VE SENT TAKUMI
OUT THERE HALF-COCKED.

142
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:24,458
- ( engine revving )

143
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:29,083
- ♪ DRIVIN' CRAZY ♪

144
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:33,541
- I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING
LIKE THE WAY THIS GUY

145
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:35,708
HANDLES THAT PIECE OF CRAP.

146
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:37,833
HOW IN THE HELL
AM I SUPPOSED TO KEEP UP?

147
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:46,125
- ♪ DRIVIN' CRAZY ♪

148
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:51,166
- DAMMIT! I CAN'T CATCH UP
TO HIM ON THE STRAIGHTAWAYS

149
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,958
WHEN I CAN'T EVEN CORNER
AT THE PACE THIS GUY'S SETTIN'.

150
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:56,541
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
THIS IS JUST PATHETIC.

151
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:17,125
- Kenta: SORRY. I'M STILL
NOT REALLY FOLLOWIN' YA HERE.

152
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:21,000
- USE YOUR HEAD. HOW MUCH
DOES THE EIGHT-SIX WEIGH?

153
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:24,458
- I GUESS 950 KILOGRAMS OR SO?

154
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:27,333
- EXACTLY. THE WHOLE THING
WEIGHS JUST UNDER A TON.

155
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:30,250
BUT THE CAPPUCCINO
IS EVEN LIGHTER.

156
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:32,583
AT MOST
WE'RE TALKING AROUND 700.

157
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:33,750
- YEAH. SO?

158
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:36,250
- THAT'S A 250-KILOGRAM
DIFFERENCE.

159
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:39,041
THE LESS A CAR WEIGHS,
THE EASIER IT IS TO CONTROL.

160
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:41,083
THAT'S WHY YOU DON'T SEE
ANY BIG CLUNKERS RACING.

161
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:42,791
THEIR INERTIA HOLDS 'EM BACK.

162
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,541
IT'S BASIC PHYSICS.

163
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:45,791
- BUT YOU CAN'T FINE-TUNE
A CAPPUCCINO

164
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:47,708
LIKE YOU CAN AN
EIGHT-SIX, CAN YOU?

165
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:49,791
I MEAN,
LIGHTWEIGHT'S ALL IT'S GOT.

166
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:51,750
- DOESN'T MATTER HOW MUCH
YOU TRY TO FINE-TUNE IT.

167
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:53,166
LIGHTER'S ALWAYS BETTER.

168
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,250
- COME ON, MAN. YOU DON'T THINK
TAKUMI'S GONNA LOSE.

169
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:56,666
- KENTA, WHAT DO I
KEEP TELLING YOU

170
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,583
ABOUT JUMPING TO CONCLUSIONS?

171
00:10:58,666 --> 00:10:59,833
I'VE SAID IT BEFORE.

172
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:02,750
WHENEVER TAKUMI'S RACING,
ALL BETS ARE OFF.

173
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:17,625
- JUST FOCUS ON THAT
SWEET FRICTION

174
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:20,000
BETWEEN THE TREADS
AND THE ROAD, DUDE.

175
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:22,333
THOSE CORNERS LOVE
THIS FRIGGIN' LITTLE CAR,

176
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:23,833
BUT DON'T GET RECKLESS.

177
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:26,166
THIS THING'LL HYDROPLANE
LIKE A LEAF.

178
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,166
UNTIL THE DAY SOME
GENIUS INVENTS A CAR

179
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,041
THAT CAN HANDLE SPEED
IN WHATEVER CONDITIONS

180
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:32,791
YOU THROW AT IT,
JUST KEEP DOIN' WHAT YOU DO.

181
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:34,583
COMPENSATE FOR LACK
OF UNDERSTEER

182
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:35,958
BY DIGGIN' INTO THE OVERSTEER

183
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:39,000
AT THE START OF EACH CORNER
LIKE THE BADASS YOU ARE.

184
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:40,333
THAT'S HOW IT'S DONE!

185
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:43,291
FOUR-WHEEL DRIFT, BABY.
RALLY STYLE!

186
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:53,750
DAMN IT. HOW'S HE STAYING
ON ME LIKE THIS?

187
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:56,666
BASTARD'S RIGHT UP MY ASS.

188
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:01,333
THIS RAIN'S A BITCH, THAT'S WHY.

189
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:03,500
EVEN I'M HOLDIN' BACK A LITTLE
'CAUSE OF IT.

190
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:05,333
IT'S JUST TOO BIG A GAMBLE
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

191
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:06,541
HOW MUCH LEEWAY YOU'VE GOT

192
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:09,625
WHEN YOU'RE BRAKING.
CAN'T WIN IF YOU CRASH.

193
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,208
I SURE AS HELL HOPE THIS CRAZY
SON OF A BITCH GETS THAT.

194
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:20,500
THIS TAG-ALONG CRAP
IS GONNA GET BOTH OF US KILLED.

195

00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:27,666
- I WISH I HAD KNOWN.

202
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:30,375
ABOUT WHAT THESE GUYS
HAD UP THEIR SLEEVES, I MEAN.

203
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:32,416
I ONLY FOUND OUT
THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY.

204
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:36,166
AND TO BE HONEST, I FEEL
PAINTED INTO A CORNER.

205
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:40,666
LIKE I MIGHT'VE
MADE A MISTAKE. SO...

206
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,250
- YOU MAKE A MISTAKE?

207
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:44,666
AH, COME ON. WHEN'S
THE LAST TIME THAT HAPPENED?

208
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:47,750
- TONIGHT FOR ONE.
HELL, I SCREW UP CONSTANTLY.

209
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:50,708
I'M JUST REALLY GOOD
AT BLUFFING MY WAY OUT OF IT.

210
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:52,666
I HAVE BEEN LATELY.

211
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:56,041
WHEN I GET THINGS RIGHT IT'S
MORE LUCK THAN ANYTHING ELSE,

212
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:59,000
SOME UNPREDICTABLE FACTOR
USUALLY MAKES AN APPEARANCE,

213
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:02,750
WASHES AWAY ANY SIGNS OF MY
POOR JUDGMENT, SO TO SPEAK.

214
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:04,583
- WASHES THEM ALL AWAY, HUH?

215
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:16,500
- I'M DRAWIN' A COMPLETE BLANK.

216
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:18,541
WHAT WAS RYOSUKE TRYING
TO TELL ME BACK THERE?

217
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:24,875
HOW WOULD KYOICHI AND HIS CREW
HANDLE CONDITIONS LIKE THESE?

218
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:34,208
HE SAID TRY AND MAKE UP FOR THE
CORNERS ON THE STRAIGHTAWAYS,

219
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:35,375
BUT HOW?

220
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,583
THAT CAR WEIGHS
NEXT TO NOTHING.

221
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:41,041
HOW CAN I OVERTAKE SOMEONE WHEN
I CAN'T EVEN MATCH THEIR SPEED?

222
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:58,250
- IF ANYTHING MAKES UP
FOR MY MISTAKE TONIGHT,

223
00:14:58,333 --> 00:14:59,791
IT'LL BE THIS DOWNPOUR.

224
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:01,958
- BUT I'M NOT SURE
THAT MAKES ANY SENSE, RYOSUKE.

225
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:04,500
THE RAIN'S JUST GONNA
MAKE THINGS HARDER FOR HIM.

226
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:06,875
AT LEAST THAT'S
THE THEORY ANYWAY.

227
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:10,666
SORRY, I DON'T MEAN
TO SECOND-GUESS YOU.

228
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:11,833
BUT THE WETTER THE PAVEMENT,

229
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:13,083
THE HARDER IT IS FOR THE TIRES

230
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:14,958
TO KEEP A GOOD GRIP
ON THE CORNERS.

231
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:16,916
SEEMS TO ME LIKE THAT'D MAKE
THE DIFFERENCE IN WEIGHT

232
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,166
BETWEEN THE TWO CARS

233
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:21,375
EVEN MORE OF AN ADVANTAGE
FOR OUR OPPONENTS.

234
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:23,666
- AH, BUT THERE'S A BLIND SPOT
IN THE THEORY.

235
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,166
IF WE WERE
TALKING ABOUT A CIRCUIT RACE

236
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:28,666
IN BROAD DAYLIGHT, THEN YEAH,
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY DEAD-ON.

237
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:32,166
BUT RAIN ON MOUNTAIN PASS AT
NIGHT IS A DIFFERENT ANIMAL,

238
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,333
ONE THAT TESTS A
DRIVER'S INNATE SKILL,

239
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:37,583
NOT JUST HOW HE HANDLES
A PARTICULAR CAR.

240
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:39,833
ANY SIMULATION OF A RACE
UNDER CONDITIONS LIKE THESE

241
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:41,291
WOULD HAVE TO
TAKE INTO ACCOUNT MATTERS

242
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:43,333
BEYOND PURE TECHNIQUE.

243
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:45,208
- LIKE WHAT?

244
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:47,208
- LIKE HOW A DRIVER EVOLVES.

245
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:49,708
TAKUMI'S STRENGTH
IS HIS ABILITY TO ADAPT.

246
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:52,833
IF HE CAN FIND A WAY TO USE
THIS RAIN TO HIS ADVANTAGE,

247
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:57,000
THEN THE EIGHT-SIX'S RELATIVE
WEIGHT CAN GIVE HIM THE EDGE.

248
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:58,666
BUT LIKE I SAID, WHEN
I GET THINGS RIGHT

249
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,791
IT'S USUALLY BECAUSE OF LUCK,

250
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:02,166
HIS LUCK.

251
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:08,375
- I THINK I CAN
CATCH UP WITH HIM

252
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:10,458
AT THE END OF THIS STRAIGHTAWAY.

253
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:16,458
SO I CAN MATCH HIS PACE.
I'LL BE DAMNED.

254
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:19,833
STILL NEW TERRITORY
FOR ME, THOUGH.

255
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:23,291
WINNING ON POWER ONLY TO GET
MY ASS BEAT ON THE CORNERS.

256
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:27,291
THIS IS FRIGGIN' PATHETIC.
I'VE NEVER BEEN SO STRESSED.

257
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:31,041
TO THINK I'VE GOTTA RELY ON
STRAIGHTAWAYS IN A DOWNHILL RUN.

258
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:32,458
- ( boosting )

259
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:38,875
MEANWHILE THE
SMUG LITTLE BASTARD

260
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:41,333
IS DRIFTING LIKE A
FEATHER IN THE WIND.

261
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:44,958
GOD, I WANNA PUT THE PRESSURE
ON HIM SO BAD I CAN TASTE IT!

262
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:48,791
WHAT A MINUTE!

263
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:52,000
THAT'S WHAT KYOICHI DOES.
YEAH, IT'S GOTTA BE!

264
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:08,833
- DUDE, ARE YOU SEEING THIS?
THAT CAPPUCCINO IS FLYIN'!

265
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:10,375
- THAT EIGHT-SIX IS
HAVING A HARD TIME

266
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:11,416
JUST KEEPING UP WITH IT.

267
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,208
- I NEVER THOUGHT I'D SAY THIS,

268
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:15,875
BUT PROJECT D JUST
MIGHT BE SCREWED.

269
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:27,000
- OKAY, HERE COMES
MY LITTLE TRIBUTE

270
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:29,916
TO KYOICHI'S IDEA OF FAIR PLAY.

271
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,500
I'VE GOTTA CLOSE THE GAP BETWEEN
US FOR THIS TO WORK,

272
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:35,083
WHATEVER IT TAKES.

273
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:37,541
GET READY, ASSHOLE.
WE'RE ABOUT TO GET REAL COZY.

274
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:46,250
- HE'S STILL ON HIM? HOW
THE HELL IS HE MANAGING THAT?

275
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:47,666
- ( van engine starts )

276
00:17:57,458 --> 00:18:00,250
- ALL RIGHT. WHATEVER, DUDE,
JUST KEEP ME POSTED. COOL.

277
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:01,666
( hangs up phone )

278
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:04,250
HEY, THEY JUST PASSED THROUGH
THE HAIRPIN CANYON.

279
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:07,708
HE SAYS THE GAP BETWEEN 'EM
IS ONLY ABOUT 10 OR 15 METERS.

280
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:15,875
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

281
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:18,250
THE EIGHT-SIX SHOULDN'T BE ABLE
TO KEEP UP WITH THE CAPPUCCINO

282
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:20,291
FOR AS LONG AS IT HAS.

283
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:21,791
- ( wind howling )

284
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,500
- THE RACE CAN'T
BE GOING LIKE THIS,

285
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:33,500
NOT ACCORDING TO MY SIMULATION.

286
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:35,750
THE RAIN WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
OUR ACE IN THE HOLE!

287
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:40,541
IF SAKAMOTO CAN'T SHAKE HIM
ON THE INCLINES,

288
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:42,125
HE'LL MISS HIS WINDOW.

289
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:43,333
ONCE THE ROAD LEVELS OFF,

290
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:45,791
IT'S ANYBODY'S GUESS WHO'LL
TAKE THE LEAD.

291
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:51,291
I'VE MADE A MISTAKE.

292
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:53,250
- HUH?

293
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:54,833
- I'M AFRAID THE EIGHT-SIX'S
DRIVER IS THROWING

294
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:56,083
THE PROVERBIAL
MONKEY-WRENCH

295
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:58,291
INTO WHAT, BY MY
CALCULATIONS AT LEAST,

296
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:00,583
SHOULD HAVE BEEN A
SUREFIRE VICTORY.

297
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:14,458
- I'VE GOT HIM! I CAN FEEL IT
BY THE WAY THE EIGHT-SIX

298
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:16,833
IS RESPONDING TO ME.

299
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:19,625
THE TREADS MIGHT AS WELL BE
FUSED TO MY NERVOUS SYSTEM.

300
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:22,416
IT'S LIKE I'M GRIPPING THE WET
PAVEMENT WITH MY OWN BARE HANDS.

302
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:26,125
- HELL, IN THIS BABY I CAN
PRACTICALLY TELL YOU

303
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:27,833
HOW MUCH WATER THE TIRES
ARE SPRAYING,

304
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,250
DOWN TO THE DROP.

305
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:33,041
ALL RIGHT,
TIME TO STOP SCREWIN' AROUND.

306
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:38,666
STAY IN THE ZONE, DUDE. THERE
ARE ONLY ONE OR TWO PLACES LEFT

307
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,625
WHERE YOU CAN INITIATE
A COUNTER-ATTACK.

308
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:49,208
- THERE IS ONE THING
THAT WORRIES ME.

309
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:50,791
- HMM?

310
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:52,625
- SURELY THE FIRST THING THAT
COMES TO MIND

311
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:53,958
WHEN YOU THINK
OF KYOICHI'S STYLE

312
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:56,291
IS HIS COUNTER ATTACKS, RIGHT?

313
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:58,083
- PROBABLY.

314
00:19:58,166 --> 00:19:59,375
- THAT'S JUST IT.

315
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:01,208
I MEAN, TAKUMI'S BOUND TO BE
CONFUSED OUT THERE

316
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:02,916
HE'S GONNA MAKE
THE SAME ASSUMPTION,

317
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,750
TRYING TO PULL OFF
A COUNTERATTACK IN THIS WEATHER

318
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:05,875
WOULD BE BAD NEWS.

319
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:07,291
- IT CERTAINLY WOULD BE.

320
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:09,458
YOU UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION
PRETTY WELL.

321
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:12,041
IF THAT'S HOW HE CHOOSES
TO INTERPRET WHAT I SAID,

322
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:13,875
THERE'LL BE NEXT TO NO CHANCE
OF HIS WINNING.

323
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,750
- YOU GOTTA BE SHITTIN' ME!

324
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:48,416
WATARU'S EIGHT-SIX COULDN'T HOLD
A CANDLE TO THIS BABY.

325
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,708
WHAT THE HELL?
AM I MISSING SOMETHING?

326
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:53,125
HOW IS THIS GUY SO DAMN FAST?

327
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:57,208
JACKASS IS GOIN' AT IT
LIKE THE ROAD'S DRY AS A BONE,

328
00:20:57,291 --> 00:21:00,208
WHILE IT'S ALL I CAN DO
NOT TO HYDROPLANE.

329
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:01,625
I CAN'T PUSH IT ANYMORE.

330
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:03,583
ROAD'S JUST TOO DAMN DANGEROUS.

331

YOU'RE NOT WUSSIN' OUT.
YOU'RE STAYIN' ALIVE.

332
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:26,541
- I HATE WEATHER LIKE THIS.

333
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:28,208
ONE LITTLE MISTAKE AND BOOM,

334
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:30,666
EVEN THE BEST DRIVERS'LL
CRASH AND BURN.

335
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:33,208
RAIN REDUCES THE WHOLE THING
TO A CRAP SHOOT.

336

REALLY DOESN'T MATTER
HOW GOOD YOU ARE.

337
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:38,541
SAKAMOTO'S CRAZY,
BUT THE MAN'S NOBODY'S FOOL.

338
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:40,166
EVEN HE'S GONNA
SECOND-GUESS HIMSELF

339
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:42,041
IN A FRIGGIN' DOWNPOUR
LIKE THIS ONE.

340
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:43,833
AT LEAST I SURE HOPE SO.

I HOPE BOTH OF 'EM DO,
FOR THAT MATTER.

342

I MEAN, HELL.

343
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:48,791
NOBODY WANTS TO SEE
TWO GOOD DRIVERS WASTED

344
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:52,000
OVER A STUPID RACE LIKE THIS.

345
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:53,708
JUST TRY TO IMAGINE
WHAT IT MUST BE LIKE

346
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:55,333
FOR THE TWO OF 'EM OUT THERE.

347
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:58,083
LIKE A WHITE-KNUCKLED
RIDE THROUGH HELL.

348
00:21:58,166 --> 00:21:59,875
GOD KNOWS IT WOULD BE FOR ME.

349
00:22:07,916 --> 00:22:10,166

WITH THIS GUY?

350
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:12,041
GET OFF MY ASS ALREADY, DUDE.

OUT FOR HIM, OKAY?

382
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,541
I JUST HOPE THE RAIN GIVES HIM
THAT LITTLE EXTRA PUSH

383

RYOSUKE SEEMS TO THINK IT WILL.
