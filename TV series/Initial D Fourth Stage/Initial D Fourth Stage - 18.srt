00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:44,250
FROM EXPEDITIONS THIS WEEK.

10
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:46,916
- YEAH YOU HEARD RIGHT.
REPAIRING KEISUKE'S CAR

11
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,291
IS PROBABLY GOING
TO TAKE ANOTHER WEEK,

12
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:49,916
MAYBE EVEN A LITTLE BIT
LONGER THAN THAT.

13
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,416
WE FIGURED WE'D TAKE
SOME TIME OFF

14
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,541
TO GIVE EVERYBODY
SOME MUCH NEEDED REST.

15
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:57,041
- THAT LAST SAITAMA EXPEDITION
MUST'VE BEEN ROUGH ON YOU GUYS.

16
00:02:57,125 --> 00:02:58,375
- TELL ME ABOUT IT.

17
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:00,250
DEALING WITH JERKS DUMPING
OIL ALL OVER THE COURSE,

18
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:02,041
BUSTING UP KEISUKE'S CAR.

19
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:03,666
- I GUESS IN A COUNTRY THIS SIZE

20
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,083
YOU'RE BOUND TO RUN
INTO A FEW PRICKS

21
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:06,500
IF YOU TRAVEL LONG ENOUGH.

22
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:08,083
- Takumi: I GUESS,

23
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:11,583
BUT I WASN'T EXPECTING THEM TO
TARGET OUR PRACTICE LIKE THAT?

24
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:14,416
IT MADE ME REALIZE I GOTTA KEEP
MY GUARD UP 24/7.

25
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,541
- YEAH, BUT COME ON, DUDE,
YOU STILL WON.

26
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:19,041
MAN, YOU'RE A DRIVER
AFTER MY OWN HEART.

27
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:21,041
IT'S LIKE WINNINGS
A PART OF YOUR NATURE NOW!

28
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:23,208
THE ONLY THING THAT SURPRISE
ME IS IF YOU WEREN'T FIRST

29
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:24,875
TO CROSS THE LINE.

30
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:27,666
- YOU SAY THAT BUT IT'S REALLY
DIFFICULT TO KEEP WINNING

31
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,833
ON COURSES YOU'VE NEVER
EVEN SEEN BEFORE.

32
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:32,583
NOT TO MENTION ALL THE PRESSURE
THAT COMES ALONG WITH IT.

33
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:34,625
- THIS LAST BATTLE WE HAD,

34
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:38,166
IT GAVE ME THE CHANCE TO SEE HOW
INCREDIBLE KEISUKE REALLY IS.

35
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:41,333
HE NEVER GIVES UP.

36
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:42,750
IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW TOUGH
THE SITUATION GETS

37
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:44,458
OR HOW FAST HIS OPPONENT IS,

38
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:48,041
NOTHING PULLS HIS CONCENTRATION
OF ATTACKING THE COURSE.

39
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:51,166
EVEN SOME OF OUR GUYS STARTED
TO THINK IT WAS A LOSS CAUSE,

40
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:55,166
BUT KEISUKE KEPT PUSHING,
THERE'S AN ENERGY TO HIM,

41
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,375
YOU KNOW. IT'S HARD NOT
TO GET PULLED IN.

42
00:03:57,458 --> 00:03:59,291
WATCHING THAT MADE
ME REALIZE THAT

43
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:01,375
LOSING IS JUST NOT
AN OPTION FOR ME.

44
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:04,666
IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT
PRESSURE TRY DRIVING FOR THE D.

45
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:08,083
- ( sighs ) YEAH,
IT SOUNDS LIKE IT.

46
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:10,291
AFTER ALL PROJECT D HAS
COME THIS FAR

47
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,250
WITHOUT LOSING ONE TIME.

48
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:14,625
THE PRESSURE ON BOTH OF
YOU MUST BE ENORMOUS.

49
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:17,791
- I KNOW RIGHT? SERIOUSLY,
WE CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE IT.

50
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:21,041
- Iketani: YEAH, WAIT,
WHADDYA MEAN "WE"?

51
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,833
- HEY, LONG WAIT?

52
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:48,333
- MMM-MMM. IT'S WEIRD
SEEING YOU IN THAT FC?

53
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:50,541
- YEAH WELL, I HAD TO BORROW
MY BROTHERS CAR.

54
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:52,583
HE USUALLY DOESN'T
LET ME USE IT.

55
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:55,250
TODAY THOUGH, I TWISTED HIS ARM.

56
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:57,000
C'MON, HOP ON IN.

57
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:58,458
- SURE!

58
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:24,416
- SO, WHERE DO YOU
WANT TO EAT?

59
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,166
I OWE YOU BIG FOR THE
OTHER DAY, SO IT'S YOUR CALL.

60
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,125
WE CAN EVEN TAKE THE
HIGHWAY UP INTO TOKYO,

61
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:31,250
IF YOU'RE IN THE MOOD.

62
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:33,333
- YEAH, THAT SOUNDS GOOD.

63
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:38,041
BUT I'M NOT ALL THAT CRAZY
ABOUT CROWDED PLACES.

64
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:41,375
I GUESS I PREFER GUNMA OVER
TOKYO, IF THAT'S COOL BY YOU.

65
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:43,875
- HEY, IT'S WHATEVER YOU
WANT TO DO.

66
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:47,208
- I JUST FIGURED IT BE BETTER IF
WE'RE GOING TO BE IN THE CAR.

67
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:49,000
IF WE'RE IN GUMNA,
WE CAN DRIVE AROUND

68
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:52,666
AND NOT HAVE TO DEAL WITH TOKYO
TRAFFIC ALL DAY. IS THAT OK?

69
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,250
- SOUNDS GOOD.

70
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:02,875
WOW! WHAT AN
AMAZING VIEW!

71
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:05,750
ALL THE CARS LOOK
SO TINY FROM UP HERE.

72
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:08,208
I WONDER WHERE THE
HIGHWAY ENTRANCE IS.

73
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:14,625
SO WHAT'S THE PLAN
FOR PROJECT D

74
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:17,250
NOW THAT SAITAMA
EXPEDITION IS OVER?

75
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:19,125
WHERE ARE YOU GUY'S
HEADED OFF TO NEXT?

76
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:20,333
- IBARAKI.

77
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:22,000
- WHOA, THAT'S PRETTY FAR AWAY.

78
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:34,208
HEY, I WAS WONDERING...

79
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:35,500
- SUP...

80
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:37,416
- YOU MIND IF I KEEP
SHOWING UP AT YOUR BATTLES

81
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,833
TO CHEER YOU ON?

82
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:43,500
IT'S COOL IF YOU WANT TO IGNORE
ME. I GET IT WHY YOU DO THAT.

83
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:47,875
I JUST LOVE WATCHING YOU DRIVE.

84
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:50,666
BESIDES, MAYBE I'D
GET THE OPPORTUNITY

85
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,125
TO HELP YOU OUT AGAIN.

86
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:54,208
I MEAN IT WAS LUCKY I WAS
THERE THE LAST TIME, RIGHT?

87
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:56,083
YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN
YOU MIGHT NEED ME.

88
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:01,333
- YOU'RE SOMETHING ELSE,
YOU KNOW THAT?

89
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:03,166
WHEN YOU GET AN IDEA,

90
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:06,250
I BET IT'S PRETTY POINTLESS
TO TALK YOU OUT OF IT.

91
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:08,166
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S BECAUSE
YOU'RE YOUNG OR WHAT,

92
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,125
BUT WHATEVER IT IS...

93
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:13,458
I CAN ALREADY TELL
YOU'RE THE TYPE OF PERSON

94
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:15,375
WHO WOULD TACKLE A CORNER
WITH NO HESITATION,

95
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:17,583
WITHOUT EVEN KNOWING WHAT'S
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT?

96
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:20,625
- IS THAT A BAD THING?

97
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:22,625
- NAH, I'M JUST TALKIN'.
YOU CAN FORGET ABOUT IT.

98
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:25,541
WE CAN TALK ABOUT THAT
AFTER DINNER.

99
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:28,125
I'M GETTING HUNGRY.
HOW 'BOUT YOU?

100
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:31,541
- ( phone ringing )

101
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:32,875
- Fumihiro: HEY, RYOSUKE?
IT'S ME.

102
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:35,875
I CALLED TO GIVE YOU AN
UPDATE ON THE FD.

103
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:38,166
IT'S A BIG JOB, BUT IT LOOKS
LIKE WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO DO

104
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,958
EVERYTHING WE TALKED
ABOUT FOR HER.

105
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:42,958
THE WHOLE NINE, I THOUGHT
YOU MIGHT WANT TO KNOW.

106
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:47,250
- SOUNDS GOOD. I APPRECIATE
THE HELP. THANKS, FUMIHIRO.

107
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:50,666
- NO SWEAT. HEY I'M JUST
GLAD TO HAVE A HAND IN IT.

108
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,958
IT'S A GREAT EXCUSE TO PULL AN
ALL OUT MODIFICATION,

109
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:54,541
REALLY MAKE SOME IMPROVEMENTS.

110
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:57,750
AFTER THIS, YOU WON'T BELIEVE
WHAT THE FD WILL BE CAPABLE OF.

111
00:07:57,833 --> 00:08:02,166
- THAT'S GOOD. CAUSE WE GOT SOME
DIFFICULT BATTLES COMING UP.

112
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,875
SO WE NEED TO LIGHTEN THE
LOAD ON THE DRIVERS

113
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:06,291
AS MUCH AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE.

114
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:07,833
- I WAS ACTUALLY PLANNING
ON TAKING KENTA

115
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:09,583
AND CHECKING OUT THE NEXT
COURSE TOMORROW.

116
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:11,791
GET AN IDEA OF WHAT
THE GUYS WILL BE UP AGAINST.

117
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:14,458
- PERFECT, JUST BE
CAREFUL OUT THERE, OKAY?

118
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:16,583
- GOT IT. I'LL CALL YOU
LATER ON.

119
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,583
- THIS DOESN'T FEEL REAL.

120
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:34,666
TO EVERYONE ELSE HERE,
I'M SURE WE LOOK LIKE

121
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,000
A NORMAL EVERYDAY LOVING COUPLE

122
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:39,041
OUT ON A ROMANTIC DATE.

123
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:40,958
I'VE NEVER BEEN THIS HAPPY.

124
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:42,958
MY HEART IS BEATING SO FAST,

125
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:45,291
IT FEELS LIKE A TACHOMETER
WITH THE NEEDLE PUSHED UP

126
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:47,875
ALL THE WAY IN THE RED.

127
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:49,791
I GUESS THIS IS WHAT IT
FEELS LIKE TO SIT ACROSS

128
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:51,916
FROM YOUR SOUL MATE.

129
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,916
I NEVER THOUGHT I COULD FEEL
THIS WAY ABOUT SOMEONE.

130
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,583
I DON'T EVER WANT THIS
NIGHT TO END.

131
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:06,333
AMAZING.

132
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:09,666
DRIVING AKAGI'S IN THE PASSENGER
SEAT OF MY DARLING'S CAR.

133
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,500
HE'S DRIVING CASUALLY
LIKE HE'S ON AUTO PILOT.

134
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:14,166
BUT I CAN TELL THE DIFFERENCE.

135
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,375
EVERY TURN IS ULTRA SMOOTH.

136
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:17,833
HIS TECHNIQUE IS SO ADVANCED

137
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:20,875
THAT EVEN DRIVING THE SPEED
LIMIT IS AN EXPERIENCE.

138
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:24,000
IT'S INCREDIBLE.

139
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:26,291
THERE'S NO CHANGE IN MOMENTUM
WHEN HE UP SHIFTS.

140
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:29,416
IT'S ALMOST LIKE IT'S
SECOND NATURE TO HIM.

141
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,250
HE MANIPULATES THE
CLUTCH SO DELICATELY,

142
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:34,708
AND YET HE'S STILL IN COMPLETE
COMMAND OF THE ROAD.

143
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:39,000
IF THERE'S SUCH A THING AS
PERFECT TECHNIQUE,

144
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:40,833
THIS MIGHT BE IT.

145
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:50,208
YOUR DRIVING IS
UNBELIEVABLE, KEISUKE.

146
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:54,875
- YOU THINK SO?
I WASN'T EVEN REALLY TRYING.

147
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:56,916
- THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT
SO KILLER.

148
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,583
YOU FINESSE YOUR WAY BETWEEN
THE CLUTCH AND THE GEAR BOX

149
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:00,791
LIKE IT'S NOTHING.

150
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:03,375
I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT BEFORE.

151
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:05,500
- WELL, IT ISN'T LIKE THAT
ALL THE TIME.

152
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:07,458
JUST BE GLAD THAT I WASN'T
DRIVING LIKE I DO

153
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:08,791
IN THE MIDDLE OF A RACE,

154
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:11,708
I CAN BE A LITTLE ROUGH
ON THE CLUTCH.

155
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:14,041
CONSTANTLY PUSHING A CAR
ALL THE WAY TO ITS LIMITS

156
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:15,375
WHEN WE'RE ON EXPEDITIONS,

157
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:17,750
ADDS A LOT OF STRESS
AND A LOT OF WEAR AND TEAR,

158
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:19,125
SO WHEN I'M DRIVING OR OFF PEAK

159
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:22,541
I LIKE TO TRY AND BABY HER
AS MUCH AS I CAN.

160
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,208
- Man: HEY!

161
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,125
CHECK IT OUT, MAN, IT'S KEISUKE.

162
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,083
- WHAT THE HECK ARE
YOU DOING OUT HERE?

163
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:29,916
I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU ON A DATE.

164
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,833
- YEAH, WHO THE HOTTIE?
IS THAT YOUR GIRLFRIEND?

165
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:34,750
- WHY DON'T YOU GUY'S SHUT THE
HELL UP. IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.

166
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:36,208
NOW GET OUTTA HERE!

167
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:38,333
- ( both giggling )

168
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:49,875
- DON'T MIND THEM. JUST A COUPLE
OF PRICKS I USE TO HANG WITH.

169
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:52,833
I WASN'T IN THE BEST CROWD
BEFORE I STARTED DRIVING.

170
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:54,833
I USED TO GET INTO FIGHTS ALL
THE TIME

171
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:59,250
AND CAUSE ALL KINDS OF PROBLEMS
WITH MY PARENTS AND AT SCHOOL.

172
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:02,166
IT SOUNDS STUPID WHEN
I TALK ABOUT IT NOW,

173
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,250
BUT BACK THEN,
I DIDN'T HAVE ANY DIRECTION.

174
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:06,583
I WAS ALWAYS FELT BORED
AND ANGRY

175
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,791
AND DON'T KNOW I GUESS
I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO HANDLE IT.

176
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:13,083
- I KNOW THAT FEELING
VERY WELL.

177
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:16,541
- AFTER A WHILE IT SEEMS LIKE MY
PARENTS HAD GIVEN UP ON ME.

178
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:19,208
BUT MY BROTHER UNDERSTOOD
WHAT I WAS GOING THROUGH.

179
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:22,500
WHENEVER I LOOK AT THIS BABY,

180
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:25,416
IT TAKES ME BACK TO THE FIRST
TIME HE GOT ME IN THIS FC

181
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,541
AND BROUGHT ME OUT
TO MOUNT AKAGI.

182
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:33,125
AS SOON AS WE HIT THE DOWNHILL
HE WENT ALL OUT.

183
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:35,583
I'M NOT GOING TO LIE
I WAS FREAKIN' TERRIFIED.

184
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:38,375
I SERIOUSLY THOUGHT
WE WERE DEAD.

185
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:40,583
AT THAT POINT I STARTED
TO THINK HE HAD PLANS

186
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:41,833
TO TAKE HIS DELINQUENT
BROTHER OUT

187
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:45,208
ON SOME KIND OF
DOUBLE SUICIDE RUN.

188
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:46,625
- ( chuckles )

189
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,208
- THAT WAS THREE YEARS AGO.

190
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:52,166
AND I STILL HAVEN'T BEEN
ABLE TO BEAT MY BROTHER'S

191
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,833
DOWNHILL TIME FROM BACK THEN,
NOT FROM LACK OF TRYING.

192
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:56,500
- WHAT? NO WAY!

193
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:58,916
YOU DON'T STILL THINK RYOSUKE
IS THAT MUCH BETTER THAN YOU,

194
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,500
DO YOU?

195
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:03,208
- WELL, YEAH. BUT EITHER WAY MY
BROTHER TURNED MY LIFE AROUND

196
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:05,166
FOR THE BETTER THAT NIGHT.

197
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:06,916
I'D HATE TO THINK WHAT I
WOULD HAVE ENDED UP LIKE

198
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,625
IF I WASN'T ABLE TO DRIVE.

199
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:11,041
- WOW.

200
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:15,541
- AND SO, GOING BACK TO WHAT WE
WERE TALKING ABOUT EARLIER.

201
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:17,833
I GOT TO BE COMPLETELY
HONEST WITH YOU.

202
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:20,833
I'M SORRY,

203
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:23,166
BUT I JUST CAN'T DATE
ANYONE RIGHT NOW.

204
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,791
- ( gasps )

205
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:27,833
- PLEASE DON'T COME
SEE ME ANYMORE.

206
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:43,750
- ( stutters ) I...

207
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:45,125
EVEN FROM THE START,

208
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:48,083
I DIDN'T REALLY EXPECT THAT
YOU'D WANT TO DATE ME.

209
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:50,500
YOU DON'T FEEL ABOUT ME
HOW I FEEL ABOUT YOU.

210
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:55,208
I ONLY COME AROUND
BECAUSE I WANT TO.

211
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:57,625
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHERE THAT CAME FROM.

212
00:12:57,708 --> 00:13:01,875
WHAT WOULD MAKE YOU SUDDENLY
DECIDE TO BE SO COLD TO ME?

213
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:04,375
AFTER BEING SO SWEET
TO ME ALL DAY.

214
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:06,458
YOU TOOK ME DRIVING,
WE HAD A NICE DINNER,

215
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:08,583
AND YOU EVEN OPENED UP TO ME.

216
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:10,958
OR I THOUGHT YOU DID.

217
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:13,166
YOU MADE ME FEEL LIKE WE WERE
MAKING A CONNECTION

218
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,208
AND THAT MAYBE WE COULD
HAVE A CHANCE TO BE TOGETHER,

219
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:16,833
THEN YOU DROP THIS?

220
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:21,791
- I KNOW AND IT'S NOT LIKE
I DON'T LIKE YOU.

221
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:24,625
BUT I'VE DECIDED THAT I'VE ONLY
GOT ENOUGH TIME AND ENERGY

222
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:27,125
TO REALLY CONCENTRATE ON
ONE THING AND FOR RIGHT NOW

223
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:29,333
THAT THING IS PROJECT D.

224
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:32,750
IF I ALLOW MYSELF TO
BE DISTRACTED

225
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:34,791
BY EVEN ONE OTHER THING,

226
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:36,833
THEN I WON'T BE ABLE TO
PUT EVERYTHING I'VE GOT

227
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,500
INTO DRIVING FOR PROJECT D.

228
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:40,458
I CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN

229
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:42,500
- BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT!

230
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:45,083
I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT
PROJECT D IS TO YOU!

231
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:47,041
I'VE ALWAYS TRIED TO
KEEP MY DISTANCE

232
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:49,125
AND NOT GET IN YOUR WAY!

233
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:51,541
BUT THAT'S STILL ISN'T
GOOD ENOUGH.

234
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:53,791
YOU DON'T WANT ME TO
COME AROUND AT ALL?

235
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:57,791
- IT'S FOR THE BEST. AND CRYING
WON'T CHANGE MY MIND.

236
00:13:57,875 --> 00:14:01,666
I CAN'T UNDERSTAND HOW YOU JUST
WATCHING WOULD BE GOOD ENOUGH.

237
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,041
I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT WHEN YOU
FALL IN LOVE WITH SOMEONE,

238
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:07,333
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO GIVE THEM
EVERYTHING YOU HAVE TO GIVE.

239
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:09,500
IT WOULD MAKE ME FEEL
ABSOLUTELY MISERABLE

240
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:12,000
TO BE IN SUCH A
ONE SIDED RELATIONSHIP.

241
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:14,083
I WOULDN'T BE OK WITH THAT.

242
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:16,208
AND NEITHER WOULD YOU.

243
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:19,125
I'M SURPRISED YOU HAVEN'T
REALIZED THAT YOURSELF.

244
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:21,500
YOU AND ME AREN'T THE KIND OF
PEOPLE WHO CAN DO ANYTHING

245
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:24,208
IN OUR LIVES HALF WAY.

246
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:26,208
AS WE GET INTO THE SUMMER
OUR EXPEDITIONS

247
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:27,833
WILL BECOME TOUGHER AND TOUGHER,

248
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:31,000
AND I JUST WON'T HAVE THE TIME
TO COMMIT TO A GIRLFRIEND.

249
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:33,041
YOU GET WORN DOWN,
YOU START TO BLAME ME,

250
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:35,125
THAT'S JUST HOW IT'LL PLAY OUT.

251
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:40,125
I LIKE YOU AND I THINK
YOU'RE A REALLY BEAUTIFUL GIRL.

252
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:42,416
BUT YOU AND I ARE
NEVER GOING TO WORK.

253
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,833
- ( sobbing )

254
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,291
- IT'S BETTER WE STOP THIS NOW.

255
00:14:57,166 --> 00:15:00,250
- ( crying )
I WANT TO ASK YOU SOMETHING.

256
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:02,750
ONE FAVOR AND
I'LL LEAVE YOU ALONE.

257
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:05,416
JUST LET ME SIT IN
YOUR PASSENGER SEAT

258
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,166
AND TAKE ME DRIVING
AT FULL SPEED!

259
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:11,375
PLEASE!

260
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,458
- OKAY.

261
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:33,375
- JUST LIKE I THOUGHT,
HE IS AMAZING!

262
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:35,541
IT'S TOTALLY DIFFERENT
FROM EARLIER.

263
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:44,083
I KNOW HE WAS GOOD,
BUT THIS IS UNREAL.

264
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,083
COULD THIS REALLY BE
THE END?

265
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:52,083
AM I REALLY NEVER
GOING TO SEE MY BABY AGAIN?

266
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:56,000
I DON'T WANT THAT.

267
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:58,916
HE'S THE MOST AMAZING
MAN I'VE EVER MET.

268
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,916
I WISH HE WANTED WHAT I WANT.

269
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:07,083
I DON'T I'LL EVER FALL IN
LOVE AGAIN. HOW COULD I?

270
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:09,875
I'LL NEVER MEET ANYONE AS
PERFECT AS MY DARLING.

271
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:12,083
NOT AS LONG AS I LIVE.

272
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,000

280
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:12,791
- ( tires screeching )

281
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:39,000
- Yuuichi: HOW HAS TAKUMI
BEEN DOING SINCE THEN?

282
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:40,916
WHAT DO YOU THINK, IS
HE GOING TO FIND A WAY

283
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,666
TO PULL OUT OF THIS SLUMP?

284
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:45,166
- NO WAY TO TELL YET.

285
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:50,541
BUT I WILL SAY THAT IT
LOOKS LIKE HE'S HEADED

286
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:52,333
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

287
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:55,000
I'M STARTING TO SEE A WHOLE
DIFFERENT LOOK IN HIS EYES NOW

288
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:57,416
WHEN HE GETS OUT OF THE CAR
AFTER A DELIVERY.

289
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,541
- OH YEAH?

290
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:01,916
- IT'S GETTING PRETTY OBVIOUS.

291
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,125
HE'S BECOME INVOLVED
IN A HUGE BATTLE,

292
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:07,833
AND HE RACES ON THE STREETS OF
AKINA'S DOWNHILL EVERY MORNING.

293
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:09,500
- HUH? AGAINST WHO?

294
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:11,541
- HE'S RACES AGAINST HIMSELF.

295
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:13,666
- HOLD ON, DID YOU JUST
SAY HIMSELF?

296
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:16,458
- THAT'S RIGHT.

297
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:18,583
WHEN HE'S DRIVING
THE EIGHT-SIX,

298
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:20,791
HE'S DESPERATELY CHASING
AFTER THE IMAGINARY IMPREZA

299
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:22,666
THAT HE SEE'S IN FRONT OF HIM.

300
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,875
WHEN HE'S IN THE IMPREZA,
IT'S THE OPPOSITE

301
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:26,666
AND HE'S PUTTING DISTANCE
BETWEEN HIMSELF

302
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,375
AND THE EIGHT-SIX RUNNING
HIM DOWN, SEE.

303
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:31,458
- I SEE.

304
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:33,208
- SINCE HE KNOWS EVERYTHING
THERE IS TO KNOW

305
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:35,458
ABOUT THE COURSE,
IT SHOULD BE EASY FOR HIM

306
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:38,000
TO SPOT THE DIFFERENCES
BETWEEN THE TWO CARS.

307
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,666
THINGS LIKE THE
DIFFERENCE IN SPEED

308
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:42,458
FROM ONE CORNER TO ANOTHER.

309
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:46,666
- IT SOUNDS COMPLEX, BUT WITH
TAKUMI, YOU MAY BE RIGHT.

310
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:50,041
- BY NOW AFTER HAVING BEEN
BEHIND THE WHEEL OF BOTH CARS

311
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:52,750
HE SHOULD HAVE A PRETTY ACCURATE
IDEA OF HOW MANY SECONDS

312
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:55,041
AND HOW MANY METERS
THERE WOULD BE BETWEEN THEM

313
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:58,458
IF THEY WERE BATTLING IT OUT
ON A RELATIVELY LONG STRETCH.

314
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,958
IF TAKUMI IS ANYTHING
LIKE ME,

315
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:03,666
I'M BETTING HE CAN
SEE THE IMPREZA

316
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,458
THROUGH THE EIGHT-SIX'S
FRONT WINDSHIELD

317
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:09,125
AS CLEARLY AS IF
IT WERE REALLY THERE.

318
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:12,291
- ( panting ) SO HOT!

319
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:14,291
I GUESS IT MEANS SUMMERS
FINALLY HERE.

320
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:16,083
- IT WAS RIGHT AROUND
THIS TIME LAST YEAR

321
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:17,541
WHEN WE HAD THAT
ACQUAINTANCE BATTLE

322
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:19,500
AGAINST THE RED SUNS,
WASN'T IT?

323
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:21,041
- I THINK YOUR RIGHT.

324
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:24,083
- EVERYTHING ABOUT THE DOWNHILL
LEGEND OF AKINA'S EIGHT-SIX,

325
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:27,125
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT IT
ALL THAT STARTED LAST SUMMER.

326
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:30,291
- NO QUESTION THIS YEAR SURE
WENT BY IN A FLASH.

327
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:32,833
IT'S TRULY HARD TO BELIEVE THAT
TAKUMI REALLY ROSE TO THE RANKS

328
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:35,083
TO BECOME A LIVING LEGEND
AND JUST IN A YEAR.

329
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:38,208
- YEAH IT WASN'T THAT LONG AGO
HE WAS PUMPING GAS.

330
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:40,208
- ( groans )

331
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:43,791
- AND ALL OF THE SUDDEN, I AM
HORRIBLY, HORRIBLY DEPRESSED.

332
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:46,083
- YOU KNOW WHAT WE NEED,
CHICKS, MAN.

333
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:47,541
IT'S NOT RIGHT FOR
TWO STUDS LIKE US

334
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:49,416
TO BE SINGLE FOR THE SUMMER!

335
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,375
SOMEBODY TAKE ME!

336
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:56,875
- THAT SOUNDS LIKE A LOT.

337
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:59,750
I DON'T EVEN KNOW PROFESSIONAL
DRIVERS THAT WILL PUT THEMSELVES

338
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:01,416
THROUGH THAT KIND OF
ROUTINE EVERY DAY.

339
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,208
IF HE'S PUTTING THAT MUCH TIME
INTO PRACTICE

340
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:05,458
HE'S BOUND TO HAVE MADE
SOME STRIDES IN FIGURING OUT

341
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:08,916
HOW TO KEEP UP WITH THE IMPREZA
AND THE EIGHT-SIX BY NOW.

342
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,541
- YOU WOULD THINK SO, HUH.

343
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:12,333
- YEAH.

344
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:15,500
- HMM, I USUALLY WOULD TOO, BUT
YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT IT THIS WAY.

345
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:18,833
IMAGINE THAT DURING ONE OF THESE
BATTLES TAKUMI MAKES A DISCOVERY

346
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:21,000
WHILE HE'S DRIVING
THE EIGHT-SIX.

347
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:23,416
THIS DISCOVERY SHOWS HIM
A NEW LINE TO TAKE

348
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:27,041
THAT WILL SHORTEN HIS TIME
BY A FRACTION OF A SECOND.

349
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:29,666
BUT THE VERY NEXT DAY,
THE IMPREZA WILL START DRIVING

350
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,375
ON THAT EXACT SAME LINE.

351
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:35,416
- HMM, YEAH, THAT'S GOTTA BE
TOUGH ON HIM.

352
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:38,041
YOU KNOW I HATE TO SAY IT,

353
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:39,458
BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE HE'S
CHASING AN OPPONENT

354
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:41,666
THAT HE'LL NEVER CATCH UP TO.

355
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:44,291
- UNTIL NOW ALL HIS SKILLS HAVE
COME FROM HIS UNDERSTANDING

356
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:45,458
OF ONE KIND OF CAR,

357
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:47,500
BUT AS HE IMPROVES
HE'S LEARNING THE VALUE

358
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:51,458
OF KNOWING ALL YOU CAN ABOUT THE
CAR YOUR OPPONENT DRIVES.

359
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:53,750
IN A NUT SHELL, TAKUMI'S
WHOLE OUTLOOK

360
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:56,583
ON DRIVING AND TECHNIQUE
ARE CHANGING.

361
00:20:57,625 --> 00:20:58,916
LET ME PUT IT THIS WAY,

362
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,916
YOU KNOW HOW THERE ARE
AN INFINITE NUMBER OF POINTS

363
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,166
IN A LINE THAT
CONNECTS TWO POINTS?

364
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:04,666
- YEAH.

365
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,916
- THAT'S WHAT HE'S
BEGINNING TO SEE.

366
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,375
HE'LL PROBABLY START PICKING UP
ON ALL SORTS OF THINGS

367
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:11,250
HE COULDN'T BEFORE.

368
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:17,416
EVENTUALLY HIS
EXPERIENCE WILL IMPROVE

369
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,416
HIS CONFIDENCE AND TECHNIQUE.

370
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,750
THAT'S HOW HE'S GOT
THIS FAR AFTER ALL.

371
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:26,000
AND THAT'S HOW HE'LL CONTINUE.

372
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:33,458
- ( car accelerating )

373
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:48,291
- THIS IS SO AWESOME!

374
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:49,458
WITH THESE MODIFICATIONS,

375
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:52,958
I'LL NEVER LOSE TO A LAN
EVO OR A GT-R!

376
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:01,833
- THIS IS AMAZING.

377
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:04,208
AFTER ALL THE CHANGES
WE MADE TO THE FD,

378
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:07,333
ITS POWER OUTPUT AND SUSPENSION
ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.

379
00:22:11,416 --> 00:22:13,333
HE SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO
CONTROL IT SO WELL,

380
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:15,125
AT LEAST NOT THIS FAST.

381
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:21,625
MUST BE THE ACCELERATION
TECHNIQUE HE'S BEEN WORKING ON.

382
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:23,458
MAN, HE'S GOTTEN GOOD.

383
00:22:37,875 --> 00:22:41,000
- THIS IS PERFECT, YOU CAN
REALLY FEEL THE HORSEPOWER.

384
00:22:41,083 --> 00:22:42,708
BUT IT'S STILL JUST AS
EASY TO DRIVE

385
00:22:42,791 --> 00:22:44,000
BECAUSE THE
TORQUE STAYS HIGH

386
00:22:44,083 --> 00:22:46,125
FROM ALL THE MID RANGE REVVING.

387
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:50,083
ITS HANDLING ON HIGH SPEED
CORNERS IS PRETTY GOOD TOO.

388
00:22:50,166 --> 00:22:52,041
IT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE
OF THE WIDE BODY,

389
00:22:52,125 --> 00:22:55,000
BUT I BET THIS SPOILER HELPS.

390
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:57,416
THE BEST PART IS THAT IT'S
REALLY STABLE IN CORNERS NOW

391
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:00,000
WHERE I COULDN'T EVEN STEP ON
THE GAS BEFORE.

392
00:23:00,083 --> 00:23:02,541
I SWEAR, I FEEL LIKE I'M
READY FOR ANYTHING.

393
00:23:02,625 --> 00:23:05,541
MAN, NOBODY CAN
COMPETE WITH THIS RIDE.

394
00:23:05,625 --> 00:23:07,541
- WELL THEN, I GUESS THIS IS
PERFECT TIMING.

395
00:23:07,625 --> 00:23:09,375
WHAT RYOSUKE'S TOLD
ME OUR NEXT OPPONENT

396
00:23:09,458 --> 00:23:11,708
IS APPARENTLY OUR
TOUGHEST ONE TO DATE.

397
00:23:11,791 --> 00:23:14,666
- YEAH? EVEN TOUGHER THAN
THE TOUDOU SCHOOL?

398
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:16,833
- THAT'S WHAT HE SAID.
SOUNDS LIKE FUN.

399
00:23:16,916 --> 00:23:20,000
- I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHO
I'M GOING UP AGAINST NEXT.

400
00:23:20,083 --> 00:23:22,291
I'VE BEEN THINKING LATELY
THAT IT'S ABOUT TIME

401
00:23:22,375 --> 00:23:24,958
WE FOUND AN OPPONENT THAT'S
WORTHY OF A REAL BATTLE.

402
00:23:25,041 --> 00:23:27,875
THE SAITAMA AREA TURNED OUT
TO BE A LOT LESS COMPETITIVE

403
00:23:27,958 --> 00:23:30,666
THAN I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT,
IT WAS KIND OF A LETDOWN.

404
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,541
ALTHOUGH WHEN YOU REALLY
STOP TO THINK ABOUT IT,

405
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:34,333
IT TURNED OUT TO BE
KIND OF A GOOD THING.

406
00:23:34,416 --> 00:23:36,083
IT WAS A CHANCE FOR ME TO
FOCUS ON DRIVING

407
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:38,541
WITHOUT ALL THE PRESSURE
WE USUALLY DEAL WITH.

408
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:40,875
- YOU KNOW YOU MIGHT BE RIGHT.

409
00:23:40,958 --> 00:23:42,791
SEEMS LIKE EVERY RACE WE'VE
HAD AROUND HERE LATELY

410
00:23:42,875 --> 00:23:44,083
HAS TAUGHT YOU ONE
THING OR ANOTHER.

411
00:23:44,166 --> 00:23:45,375
I'M JUST GLAD YOUR
FINDING SOMETHING

412
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:47,291
TO TAKE AWAY FROM EACH ONE.

413
00:23:47,375 --> 00:23:48,708
DRIVING WITH YOU TODAY
HAS SHOWN ME

414
00:23:48,791 --> 00:23:50,125
HOW MUCH YOU'VE
ALREADY IMPROVED.

415
00:23:50,208 --> 00:23:51,666
I'M IMPRESSED.

416
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:55,500
- THANKS DUDE. I'M STARTING
TO NOTICE A LITTLE BIT TOO.

417
00:23:55,583 --> 00:23:58,583
THE RACE IN SITAMA MIGHT HAVE
NOT BEEN OUR MOST EXCITING

418
00:23:58,666 --> 00:24:02,666
BATTLE BUT I SURE LEARNED A LOT.
I'M NEVER GONNA FORGET IT.

419
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:05,583
- THAT'S GOOD. IT'S THE BEST
POSSIBLE OUTLOOK.

420
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,750
- HEY, FUMIHIRO.
- YEAH.

421
00:24:15,833 --> 00:24:18,791
- I WAS WONDERING, YOU THINK MY
BROTHER PICKS THE LOCATIONS

422
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:26,125
OF PROJECT D'S BATTLES WITH
ALL THIS IN MIND?

423
00:24:26,208 --> 00:24:27,666
- PROBABLY.

424
00:24:31,791 --> 00:24:33,541
ALL OF RYOSUKE'S
DECISIONS SEEM TO HAVE

425
00:24:33,625 --> 00:24:35,916
SOME KIND MEANING TO THEM.

426
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,833
- DO YOU THINK IT'S BECAUSE
COMPARED TO HIM

427
00:24:37,916 --> 00:24:40,458
HE SEES TAKUMI AND ME AS JUST
AS A COUPLE OF AMATEURS?

428
00:24:40,541 --> 00:24:42,875
- NAH, I DON'T THINK SO,
WHAT, DO YOU?

429
00:24:43,791 --> 00:24:45,000
- GUESS NOT.

430
00:24:50,458 --> 00:24:53,291
I HATE TO ADMIT IT AND IF YOU
EVER TELL HIM I'LL DENY IT,

431
00:24:53,375 --> 00:24:55,416
BUT I HAVE AN AMAZING
OLDER BROTHER.

432
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:59,666
THE NEXT EXPEDITION IS IN
IBARAKI RIGHT?

433
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:02,125
- WE WENT YESTERDAY,
CHECKED IT OUT.

434
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:05,666
- I FEEL LIKE I CAN'T LOSE
NO MATTER WHO I RACE.

435
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:08,083
AND WITH THIS, I CAN SHOW
MY BROTHER A RACE

436
00:25:08,166 --> 00:25:10,333
THAT WILL SURPRISE EVEN HIM.

437
00:25:26,916 --> 00:25:29,291
