- Man: SO WHAT'S GOING ON?

8
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:23,208
I HEAR JOUSHIMA AND HOSHINO ARE
COMIN' OUT TONIGHT.

9
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:25,375
IT'S WEIRD, MAN.

10
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:28,250
FOR THE TWO PILLARS OF PURPLE
SHADOW TO GET TOGETHER,

11
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:29,791
IT'S GOTTA BE SOMETHING BIG.

12
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:31,458
- YOU MEAN YOU REALLY
HADN'T HEARD?

13
00:02:31,541 --> 00:02:33,208
PROJECT D'S HEADIN' UP
TO CHALLENGE US.

14
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:35,250
- YOU GOTTA BE YANKIN' MY CHAIN.

15
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:38,416
YOU MEAN JOUSHIMA AND HOSHINO
ARE RACING PROJECT D THEMSELVES?

16
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,125
- I KINDA DOUBT THEY WILL.

17
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:42,583
I'M GUESSING THEY'LL PUT UP THE
YOUNGER DUDES IN PURPLE SHADOW

18
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:44,333
BEFORE THEY DO THAT.

19
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:47,250
THOSE GUYS HAVE BETTER THINGS TO
DO THAN RACE A COUPLE OF KIDS.

20
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,041
I MEAN THEY'RE LIKE
GODS ON THE ROAD.

21
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:51,125
THEY WON'T GET THEIR HANDS
DIRTY WITH THIS ONE.

22
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,916
- HERE THEY ARE.

23
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,416
JOUSHIMA "GOD ARM" TOSHIYA AND
KOUZOU "GOD FOOT" HOSHINO.

24
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,041
- ( sighs )

25
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:19,625
- LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE BEEN
PUTTING ON A FEW POUNDS, BUDDY.

26
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:21,583
YOU DON'T LOWER THAT
CHOLESTEROL SOON,

27
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:23,958
IT'LL KILL YOU FASTER THAN
A FIRE IN YOUR GAS TANK.

28
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:25,833
- AH, GET OFF MY CASE.

29
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:28,583
I LIVE MY LIFE THICK AND QUICK,
YOU KNOW THAT.

30
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,291
ANYWAY, WHEN HAVE YOU
KNOWN ME TO LISTEN

31
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:32,458
TO WHAT SOME DUMBASS
DOCTOR HAS TO SAY?

32
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:35,875
- ( laughs ) YEAH.
YOU AND ME BOTH, BIG GUY.

33
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:37,583
- SO PROJECT D, HUH?

34
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:40,500
I HAVEN'T BEEN THIS JAZZED ABOUT
A RACE IN A REAL LONG TIME.

35
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:42,833
MAYBE GUYS LIKE US JUST GET
EASIER TO EXCITE

36
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:44,125
THE OLDER WE GET.

37
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:46,125
BUT WHO CARES,
SOUNDS LIKE FUN.

38
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,375
- I DON'T WANNA SOUND
LIKE A JERK OR ANYTHING, BUT

39
00:03:57,458 --> 00:03:59,916
I DIDN'T THINK YOU GUYS
WERE GOING TO SHOW UP.

40
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,291
ARE YOU TWO GONNA RACE?

41
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:04,125
- THAT'S RIGHT. I HOPE IT'S
NOT A PROBLEM FOR YOU.

42
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:05,791
- OF COURSE NOT.
NOT A PROBLEM AT ALL.

43
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:07,666
YOU TWO CAN DO
WHAT YOU WANT.

44
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:10,083
IT'S JUST THAT THE MOST SENIOR
MEMBERS DON'T NEED TO WASTE

45
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:12,125
THEIR TIME RACING A BUNCH OF
KIDS IF THEY DON'T WANT TO.

46
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:14,583
- US RACING THIS HAS GOT
NOTHING TO DO WITH AGE.

47
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:17,291
THESE FELLAS ARE DRIVING ALL THE
WAY UP HERE FROM GUNMA RIGHT?

48
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:20,291
IT'S A LONG WAY. LETS GIVE THEM
A WARM IBARAKI WELCOME.

49
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:21,541
SOUND GOOD TO YOU?

50
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:23,958
- WELL, SURE. BUT WE'RE
BETTER THAN THESE GUYS,

51
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:25,375
WE'LL TAKE CARE OF
THEM FOR YOU.

52
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:27,416
- EASE OFF OF THE ATTITUDE.

53
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,000
JUST LET US DRIVE THIS ONE,

54
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:31,375
AND I'LL GUARANTEE YOU'LL
LIKE WHAT YOU SEE.

55
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:33,541
IT'S NOT LIKE WE'RE A
COUPLE OF ARROGANT JERKS

56
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:35,291
WHO JUST SHOWED UP
ON YOUR SCENE

57
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:38,250
TO TELL YOU THE WAY OF THE WORLD
AND HOW TO DRIVE ITS ROADS.

58
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:40,500
WE FORMED PURPLE SHADOW
A LONG TIME AGO

59
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:43,166
AND TAUGHT YOU A HELL OF A LOT
WHEN WE BROUGHT YOU KIDS ON.

60
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,916
BUT THE FACT IS WE'RE
GETTIN' UP THERE.

61
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,708
WE CAN'T KEEP UP WITH YOU
YOUNG KIDS ANYMORE.

62
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:49,541
- HOSHINO, THAT JUST ISN'T TRUE.

63
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:52,916
YOU KNOW NOT ONE OF US HAS COME
NEAR YOUR LEVEL OF EXPERTISE.

64
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,333
- STOP BEING SO MODEST.
YOU LOOK LIKE A DOUCHE.

65
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:57,250
YOU'RE A REGULAR ON
THE TSUKUBA CIRCUIT,

66
00:04:57,333 --> 00:05:00,000
AND YOU MAKE ALL OF THOSE CATS
LOOK LIKE FAT-CHEWING CHUMPS.

67
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:01,833
- THE TWO OF US JUST DIG
DOING CRAP LIKE THIS

68
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:03,416
AND WE DON'T GET TO THAT MUCH.

69
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,791
NO MATTER HOW OLD WE GET, WE'RE
STILL JUST TWO KIDS WITH CARS.

70
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:09,791
SO, WHAT DO YOU SAY WE TAKE
'EM FOR A FEW MORE RUNS?

71
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:12,166
- SURE. GOT CHIP THIS RUST
OFF OF OURSELVES

72
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,041
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER RIGHT.

73
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,583
- RUST? IF THOSE GUYS
THINK THEY'RE RUSTY,

74
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:37,666
I'D HATE TO KNOW
WHAT THEY THINK ABOUT US.

75
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,875
THEY BOTH HAVE THEIR SKILLS
HONED EVEN SHARPER

76
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:42,125
THAN A SAMURAI SWORD.

77
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:50,000
GOD ARM. EARNED HIS NAME BY
MASTERING THE METHOD

78
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,583
OF ONE HANDED STEERING.

79
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:54,583
DR. TOSHIYA JOUSHIMA.

80
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:03,250
AND THEN THERE'S
KOUZOU "GOD FOOT" HOSHINO.

81
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:06,708
HE GOT HIS NAME BECAUSE OF
HIS ACCELERATOR TECHNIQUES.

82
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:08,458
ONLY SOMEONE OF A
FOOT OF A GOD

83
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:11,333
COULD DO WHAT HE DOES
WITH THOSE PEDALS.

84
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:12,666
AFTER COUNTLESS BATTLES,

85
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:16,208
THESE TWO MEN ARE THE GODS
OF THE MOUNTAIN PASS.

86
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:17,875
THEY HAVE NO EQUAL.

87
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:24,875
- ( phone ringing )

88
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:33,166
- Takumi: DAD, YOU GONNA
GET THAT?

89
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,458
- ( ringing continues )

90
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:37,208
- GUESS HE'S NOT HERE.

91
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:39,750
FUJIWARA TOFU SHOP,
HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

92
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,833
- HEY, IT'S WATARU.

93
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:43,250
I'M IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD.

94
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:45,625
THOUGHT YOU MIGHT WANNA GRAB
A BITE TO EAT SOMEWHERE.

95
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:52,250
SO, WHAT'S YOUR
NEXT BIG DESTINATION?

96
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:54,791
- IBARAKI.
- RIGHT ON.

97
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:58,000
- SO, WATARU,

98
00:06:58,083 --> 00:06:59,791
I JUST WANTED TO SAY
THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING

99
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:01,375
YOU HELPED ME OUT WITH.

100
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:04,000
I THOUGHT A LOT ABOUT WHAT YOU
SAID AND I THINK I'M GETTING IT.

101
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:06,083
- GLAD TO HEAR IT HELPED OUT.
THAT DOESN'T ALWAYS HAPPEN

102
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:07,333
WHEN I GIVE ADVICE.

103
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:09,333
- IT'S LIKE I FINALLY
FEEL LIKE I'M STARTING

104
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:12,000
TO WRAP MY HEAD AROUND THE
EIGHT-SIX FOR THE FIRST TIME.

105
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:14,125
- HERE IT COMES. I WONDER
WHAT HE'S GONNA

106
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:16,625
START BABBLING ABOUT THIS TIME.

107
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:18,666
SERIOUSLY, DUDE, SOME OF THE
CRAP THAT COMES OUT OF

108
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,791
YOUR MOUTH SOMETIMES
MAKES NO FREAKIN' SENSE.

109
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:22,041
- HEY I'M ONLY BEING HONEST.

110
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:24,125
I FEEL LIKE I FINALLY GOT
A HANDLE ON HER.

111
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:26,291
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS
I KNOW WHAT I GOT TO DO

112
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:29,250
IF I WANT HER TO PERFORM
AT HER FULL POTENTIAL.

113
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:31,625
IT'S LIKE HOW, I AUTOMATICALLY
KNOW WHAT TO DO

114
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:33,541
TO CONQUER A COURSE THE
FIRST TIME OUT...

115
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:36,500
OR HOW TO BALANCE THE
SUPPORT ON MY SUSPENSION.

116
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:39,125
I'M JUST NOW STARTING TO FEEL MY
GRIP ON THOSE KINDS OF THINGS.

117
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:41,791
THAT'S ALL I'M TRYING SAY.

118
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:43,125
- WHATEVER FLOATS YOUR BOAT.

119
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:45,583
AT LEAST YOUR MAKING
PROGRESS, RIGHT?

120
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,208
STILL, IT BLOWS MY MIND.

121
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:48,958
HOW ANYONE COULD DO
WHAT YOU'VE DONE

122
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:50,833
WITH AS LITTLE INFORMATION
AS YOU'VE HAD UP TO NOW

123
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:52,083
IS A MYSTERY.

124
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:54,166
- YEAH I GUESS BUT THAT
DOESN'T MEAN I'M STUPID.

125
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,041
I'M JUST WAITING ON THE DAY
I LOSE A RACE

126
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:58,333
SO I CAN UNDERSTAND
HER EVEN BETTER.

127
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:02,333
THAT EIGHT-SIX...

128
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:20,166
- Matsumoto: WHAT'S WITH
THE ADDED MANPOWER?

129
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:24,000
WHY WE BRINGING THE EXTRA
SUPPORT CAR WITH US THIS TIME?

130
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:26,333
- BEFORE WE CAME OUT, RYOSUKE
AND I MADE A LIST OF EVERYTHING

131
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:27,541
WE KNEW WE'D NEED.

132
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:29,125
WHEN WE LOOKED AT IT ALL
SIDE-BY-SIDE,

133
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:31,250
TURNED OUT THREE CARS
WASN'T GONNA BE ENOUGH.

134
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:33,166
I JUST WANTED EVERYBODY HERE TO
KNOW WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO

135
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:34,958
UP THE ANTE
AGAINST THESE GUYS.

136
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:38,500
NOW LET THAT SINK IN REAL GOOD.

137
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:39,958
WE'VE GOT A LONG
HAUL AHEAD OF US,

138
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:41,958
SO BE CAREFUL OUT THERE. GOT IT?

139
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:43,833
- GOT IT.

140
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:45,916
- ( engine starting )

141
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:54,791
- LET'S ROLL.

142
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:00,750
- Sakai: HEY, CHIEF,
DID YOU HEAR?

143
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:03,375
PROJECT D'S NEXT OPPONENT
IS THE PURPLE SHADOW.

144
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:06,041
THEY'RE GONNA BE
RACING IN IBARAKI.

145
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:11,958
I KNOW IT SOUNDS NUTS
BUT I ALSO HEARD

146
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:14,416
IT WAS GONNA BE HOSHINO
AND JOUSHIMA IN THE BATTLE.

147
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,375
- NO SHIT.

148
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:22,208
IF YOU CAN FIND THE TIME
IN YOUR BUSY SCHEDULES,

149
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:25,416
BOTH OF YOU NEED TO GO WATCH
THESE GUYS BATTLE THE D.

150
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,833
- BUT I DIDN'T KNOW
THAT PURPLE SHADOW

151
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:28,250
WAS ANYTHING TO RIDE HOME ABOUT.

152
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:31,458
- DAIKI, WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW
COULD FILL A LIBRARY.

153
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:33,416
BOTH OF THOSE GUYS ARE
DRIVERS CHIEF HERE

154
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,208
WOULD TAKE HIS HAT
OFF TO ANY DAY.

155
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:37,125
- NO KIDDIN'.

156
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:38,458
- SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

157
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:40,500
DOES PROJECT D EVEN STAND A
CHANCE ON THIS ONE?

158
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:43,083
- THE PENDULUM IS ALWAYS
SWINGING, BOYS.

159
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:45,291
WHO KNOWS WHERE IT'S
GONNA COME BACK TO?

160
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:47,666
DON'T WORRY ABOUT WHAT
YOU CAN'T CONTROL.

161
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,375
JUST WATCH THE MATCH.
TAKE AWAY WHAT YOU CAN.

162
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:53,208
SEE HOW THESE GUYS TACKLE
SUCH AN ENORMOUS OBSTACLE

163
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:55,333
AND THINK ABOUT HOW
YOU WOULD DO IT.

164
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:57,833
THAT'S THE THING I WANT
YOU CAN TAKE AWAY.

165
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:04,250
- ( cars approaching )

166
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:11,500
- HERE WE GO.

167
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:35,791
- Hoshino: ALL THAT
SOUNDS FINE.

168
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:37,250
AND WE'LL DO EVERYTHING WE CAN

169
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:39,416
TO MAKE SURE THE NIGHT
RUNS SMOOTHLY FOR YOUR CREW.

170
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,833
- WE APPRECIATE THAT.

171
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:42,250
- SURE.

172
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:44,583
- IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE
TO MEET YOU.

173
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,208
- THESE KIDS ARE A
HECK OF A LOT NICER

174
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:51,125
THAN I'D THOUGHT THEY BE.

175
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:52,791
- THAT'S WHAT I WAS THINKING.

176
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:54,458
AFTER WHAT I SAW
ON THEIR HOMEPAGE,

177
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:58,250
I EXPECTED A BUNCH OF BAGGY PANT
WEARING, ARROGANT LITTLE PRICKS.

178
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:00,083
- I'M GETTING A GOOD VIBE.

179
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:02,583
NOW THAT WE KNOW THEY'RE
COOL, WE CAN SKIP THE MIND GAMES

180
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:05,833
AND ATTITUDE AND JUST GO
STRAIGHT TO THE RACING.

181
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:07,375
- THIS'LL BE A FUN NIGHT.

182
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:10,208
COULD BE THE BEST WE'VE
HAD IN A LONG TIME.

183
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:14,208
- YOU KNOW THE ROUTINE. FIRST
COUPLE OF RUNS AT 80%.

184
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:15,791
STAY FOCUSED, ALL RIGHT?

185
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:30,833
- ( engines revving )

186
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:40,833
- ( upbeat song playing )

187
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:54,958
- ♪ THIS TIME YOU'LL LIKE ♪

188
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:12,625
- Kenta: WHOA!

189
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:14,375
HEY, WHAT'S UP WITH
THE FOURTH VAN HERE?

190
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:17,250
YOU GOT IT FILLED UP WITH ALMOST
NOTHING ELSE BUT SPARE TIRES.

191
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:21,125
WELL, EXPECT FOR
THIS MOTOR SCOOTER.

192
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:22,833
WHAT'S THAT DOING IN HERE?

193
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:25,041
- OH THAT, I BROUGHT THAT ALONG
FOR OUR DRIVERS TO USE.

194
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:26,166
- WHY FOR THEM?

195
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:28,125
- SO THEY CAN CHECK OUT
THE COURSE.

196
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:29,833
IT'LL BE AVAILABLE TO 'EM
ANYTIME THEY WANNA USE IT

197
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,500
BEFORE DARK TOMORROW.

198
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:33,750
ON THAT SCOOTER, THEY'LL BE
ABLE TO SEE ANY DAMAGE

199
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:36,000
OR PROBLEM SPOTS
THE ROAD A LOT EASIER.

200
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:40,666
- THEN HOPEFULLY THEY'LL BE
ABLE TO DRAW OUT A MORE

201
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,833
DETAILED PLAN OF THE COURSE
BEFORE THEY'RE LOADED FOR BEAR.

202
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:44,833
I MEAN IT'D BE BEST IF THEY
COULD WALK THE ROAD,

203
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:46,583
BUT WE DON'T HAVE
THAT KINDA TIME.

204
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:50,208
THIS IS JUST ONE OF THE
NEW IDEAS RYOSUKE CAME UP WITH.

205
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:51,791
- IT'S SMART.

206
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:53,916
HE'S BEEN KICKIN' OUT A LOT OF
KILLER IDEAS LATELY, HASN'T HE?

207
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,583
- JUST WHEN THE OLD TRICKS
WON'T WORK.

208
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:58,000
SO THIS NEW CREW'S GOTTA
BE PRETTY GOOD.

209
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:03,291
- ( machine whirring )

210
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:09,833
- ALL DONE.

211
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:11,125
OK, YOU'RE LOCKED IN.

212
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:12,666
BALANCE SEEMS FINE AND THE
SUSPENSION'S SOLID.

213
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,958
JUST DO ME A FAVOR AND KEEP AN
EYE ON HOW YOUR TRACTION

214
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:16,000
HOLDS UP OUT THERE.

215
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:17,750
- COOL. WHATEVER YOU SAY.

216
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:24,625
- HOW'S THE CAR
LOOKIN' TONIGHT?

217
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:26,416
- LIKE A GREASED PISTON.

218
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,500
AND TAKUMI SEEMS TO HAVE
HIS HEAD SCREWED ON TIGHT.

219
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:32,000
THINK HE'S FINALLY CATCHIN' ON
TO A FEW OF THE THINGS IT TAKES

220
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:33,916
TO SET UP HIS CAR
BEFORE A RACE.

221
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,041
HE ISN'T THE SAME DUMB KID
HE USED TO BE.

222
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:38,375
- I'VE BEEN NOTICING THE
DIFFERENCE TOO.

223
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:40,208
I WAS JUST THINKIN'
HOW FAR HE'S COME

224
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:43,166
SINCE HIS FIRST RACE
WITH PROJECT D.

225
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:46,000
HE'S PRACTICING A LOT OUTSIDE
OF HIS TIMES WITH US,

226
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:48,250
TIMES WHEN WE CAN'T
KEEP OUR EYES ON HIM.

227
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:50,541
WHATEVER HE'S DOING,
HE'S CATCHING ONTO SOMETHIN'.

228
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:52,166
AND IT'S WORKING.

229
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:55,958
WHETHER OR NOT HE WINS,
HE'S GONNA KEEP GETTING BETTER.

230
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:59,291
INCREDIBLY SO, TAKUMI WILL
SURPASS US ALL SOME DAY.

231
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:07,166
- ( tires screeching )

232
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:27,208
- I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT
THE MODIFICATIONS ON THE FD.

233
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:29,333
BUT IT SURE AS HELL
LOOKS SWEET.

234
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:30,833
- THAT'S THE WAY
KEISUKE LIKES IT.

235
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:33,458
THE LOOK OF IT IS ONE HUNDRED
PERCENT HIS OWN DESIGN.

236
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:34,625
- SO HOW'D SHE DO?

237
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,791
- THE INCLINES ARE
STEEPER THAN I EXPECTED.

238
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:38,875
SO THE BALANCE IS SHIFTING
TOO MUCH TO THE REAR.

239
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:40,791
- YOU WANT ME TO RAISE HER UP
IN BACK A LITTLE?

240
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:42,541
- YEAH, I THINK THAT'D
HELP A LOT.

241
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:50,541
- YOU'RE KEISUKE, THE GUY
DRIVING THE FD, RIGHT?

242
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:52,375
THAT'S A REAL NICE CAR.

243
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:54,791
- MMM-HMM.

244
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:57,833
- YOU GOT THAT BADASS THING
GOIN' ON PRETTY WELL.

245
00:14:57,916 --> 00:15:01,000
BET YOU'RE POPULAR
WITH THE LADY, HUH.

246
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:02,875
I'M NOT HITTING ON YOU, KID.

247
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:04,583
IT'S JUST THAT I WAS SOMETHING
OF A LADIES MAN

248
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:05,875
WHEN I WAS YOUNGER TOO.

249
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:07,875
GUESS WE CAN
RECOGNIZE OUR OWN.

250
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:11,708
YOUTH IS THE MOST IRREPLACEABLE
OF COMMODITIES.

251
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:14,416
WHEN YOU GET TO BE MY AGE AND
YOU START STRAPPING THIS MUCH

252
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,000
DEAD WEIGHT AROUND
YOUR GUT LIKE I HAVE,

253
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:20,208
WELL, LETS JUST SAY THE BRAS
DON'T COME FLYING OFF THE GIRLS

254
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:22,458
THE WAY THEY USE TO.

255
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:24,625
DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED
ON THE AMOUNT OF MONEY

256
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:27,291
YOU GOTTA SPEND ON 'EM EITHER,
BUT STILL,

257
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:29,166
THE JOY YOU FEEL
WHEN YOU LAND ONE

258
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,583
IS GREATER THAN ANYTHING YOU
EVER FELT WHEN YOU WERE YOUNG.

259
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:33,166
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
IT'S EVEN BETTER THAN

260
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:35,916
ANY ONE OF THE HUNDREDS
OF WINS I HAD IN MY DAY.

261
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:41,500
ANYWAYS, I'M SURE IT'LL ALL COME
INTO FOCUS FOR YOU EVENTUALLY.

262
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:43,958
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO SCREW
AROUND WHEN YOU'RE YOUNG.

263
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:45,500
I GET IT.

264
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:46,958
SEE YA LATER.

265
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:49,083
OH, I ALMOST FORGOT.

266
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:52,000
I HAD SOMETHING ELSE I CAME OVER
HERE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

267
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:54,916
JUST A LITTLE IDEA ABOUT THE
BATTLE I WANTED TO TOSS AT YOU.

268
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,250
- YEAH, OKAY.
WHAT ARE YOU THINKIN'?

269
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:59,000
- OH, HOW SHOULD I PUT THIS?

270
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,500
WHEN YOU'RE RACING
A MOUNTAIN PASS,

271
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:03,416
HAVING BOTH A DOWNHILL AND
AN UPHILL'S PAR FOR THE COURSE.

272
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,875
AND IT'S NOT LIKE I'VE TWEAKED
OUT MY CAR SPECIFICALLY

273
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:07,708
FOR THE UPHILL OR ANYTHING.

274
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:09,333
I ALWAYS BELIEVED TOTAL BALANCE

275
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:11,708
IS WHAT MAKES A
TRUE STREET RACER.

276
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:13,500
SO HERE'S WHAT I'M
PROPOSING TO YOU.

277
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:15,708
LET'S NOT MAKE OUR BATTLE
JUST AN UPHILL.

278
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:18,125
I FIGURE WE'RE SKILLED ENOUGH,
SWITCH IT UP,

279
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:19,416
MAKE IT MORE INTERESTING.

280
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,208
- HOLD ON. YOU WANNA
RACE ME IN A MIXED STAGE,

281
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:24,375
WITH BOTH UPHILL AND DOWNHILL?

282
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:26,875
THAT'S WHAT I'M THINKIN', YEAH.

283
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:30,458
- KICK ASS. THAT MEANS I CAN
SHOW OFF EVERYTHING I GOT,

284
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:32,291
ESPECIALLY ON THE DOWNHILL.

285
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:37,375
THAT SOUNDS ALL RIGHT. WE CAN
DO IT JUST LIKE YOU SAID.

286
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:39,041
I THINK I'LL ENJOY THAT.

287
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:41,000
- YOU SURE SHOW A
LOT OF PROMISE, BOY.

288
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,375
THIS IS GONNA BE FUN.

289
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:45,666
OH, AND ONE MORE THING
BEFORE I GO.

290
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:48,583
YOU THINK YOU AND I CAN
DO OUR BATTLE FIRST?

291
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:50,625
- YOU MEAN BEFORE THEY
RUN THE DOWNHILL?

292
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:53,041
- JUST TO AMP UP THE
EXCITEMENT FOR ME.

293
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:55,458
I'M GETTING KIND OF IMPATIENT
IN MY OLD AGE.

294
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:57,875
WAITING FOR THINGS
GETS UNDER MY SKIN.

295
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:00,833
- THAT WORKS FOR ME TOO.
I'M PRETTY MUCH THE SAME WAY.

296
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:02,375
- WELL, OKAY.

297
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:04,125
I DON'T MIND TELLING YOU THAT
I'M GETTING REALLY PUMPED

298
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:06,416
ABOUT THIS BATTLE.

299
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,125
CATCH YOU LATER.

300
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:15,333
- HOPE YOU DIDN'T MIND ME MAKING
THE CALL ON THAT ONE, BRO.

301
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:17,833
JUST DIDN'T SEEM LIKE THERE WAS
ANY REASON TO TELL THE GUY NO.

302
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:19,458
- NAH, I THINK IT'LL BE FINE.

303
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:21,625
I'LL ADMIT IT WAS KINDA
UNEXPECTED TURN OF EVENTS,

304
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:24,208
BUT AFTER MEETING THEM I DOUBT
THEY HAVE ANY ILL INTENT.

305
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:26,375
AFTER ALL, IT ENDS UP
HELPING US OUT.

306
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:28,708
IT MAKES THE RACE A LITTLE
MORE ADVANTAGEOUS FOR US

307
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:31,083
WITHOUT MAKING US LOOK
LIKE A BUNCH OF JERKS.

308
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:33,416
I GOTTA GIVE THEM CREDIT.

309
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,541
WE HAVEN'T FACED ANYONE YET
THAT OFFERED US THE CHANCE

310
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:37,916
TO MAKE THE RACE MORE FAIR.

311
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,541
IT'S EASY TO BE GENEROUS WHEN
YOU KNOW YOU'RE THE BEST.

312
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:52,791
- I'M ALL CHARGED UP. IT'S BEEN
A WHILE SINCE I BEEN ITCHIN'

313
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:54,625
THIS BAD TO GET
BEHIND THE WHEEL.

314
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:57,708
- ( car accelerating )

315
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:02,875
- THAT OLD DUDE, I DON'T KNOW
HOW MUCH OF A THREAT HE IS

316
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:05,125
BUT HE'S GOOD.

317
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:08,250
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME?

318
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:10,083
IT'S LIKE THERE'S A WEIGHT
ON MY SHOULDERS,

319
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:12,125
EVEN MORE THAN USUAL.

320
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,083
WHATEVER IT IS, THIS WILL
STILL BE ONE HELL OF A RACE.

321
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:32,916
- Keisuke: ( sighs )
I'M BEAT, DUDE.

322
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
- PRACTICE WORE
ME OUT, TOO.

323
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:38,791
- Fumihiro: KEISUKE, FUJIWARA.
THERE YOU GUYS ARE.

324
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:41,250
ARE YOU READY TO GO?

325
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:43,166
WE BOOKED A LODGE AT THE
BASE OF THE MOUNTAIN

326
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,041
FOR YOU TWO STAY IN.

327
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:45,958
- YOU WHAT?
- THAT'S RIGHT.

328
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,333
YOU'RE BOTH GETTING TO
SLEEP IN A NICE

329
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:49,000
AIR-CONDITIONED
ROOM FOR A CHANGE.

330
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:51,583
- YEAH, OKAY.
BUT WHY JUST US TWO.

331
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:52,958
- 'CAUSE YOU'RE THE DRIVERS.

332
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:55,083
YOU GUYS ARE GONNA WIN
OR LOSE IT FOR ALL OF US.

333
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:57,208
- NAH. I DON'T NEED
A ROOM, REALLY.

334
00:18:57,291 --> 00:18:59,375
I'LL JUST SLEEP IN THE BACK
OF MY CAR LIKE I USUALLY DO.

335
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:01,708
RYOSUKE, WHY DON'T YOU TAKE
MY PLACE INSTEAD?

336
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:03,500
- I'VE NEVER HAD TO
PULL RANK BEFORE,

337
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:05,250
BUT YOU CAN CONSIDER THIS
A DIRECT ORDER

338
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:07,833
FROM YOUR TEAM LEADER.

339
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:09,541
IT'S FAR TOO HOT THIS
TIME OF YEAR FOR YOU

340
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:10,916
TO BE SLEEPING IN YOUR CAR.

341
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,750
IT COULD AFFECT YOUR DRIVING.

342
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:14,375
IT'S CRITICALLY
IMPORTANT THAT YOU DON'T FEEL

343
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:15,708
ANY FATIGUE TONIGHT.

344
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:17,166
YOU NEED TO KEEP YOUR
CONCENTRATION

345
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,666
AS HIGH AS POSSIBLE.

346
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,500
- BASICALLY, IT'S IMPORTANT FOR
YOU TWO TO GET BEAUTY REST

347
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:22,333
FOR THE SAKE OF THE TEAM.

348
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:23,625
I'LL RUN YOU DOWN TO THE LODGE.

349
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:25,875
GO GRAB YOUR THINGS AND
HOP INTO VAN NUMBER ONE.

350
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:33,416
- FUMIHIRO SAID HE'D
SWING BACK HERE

351
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,958
TO PICK US UP AROUND FOUR.

352
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:37,416
- THAT GIVE US LONGER TO SLEEP
THAN I EVER GET BACK HOME.

353
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:39,708
- ( Keisuke grunting )

354
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:43,375
I ALMOST FEEL BAD FOR
THE OTHER GUYS.

355
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:46,958
I GOTTA SAY, THOUGH, FEELS
PRETTY DAMN GOOD

356
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:48,750
TO BE ABLE TO STRETCH
OUT FOR ONCE.

357
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:50,958
- NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT, MAN.

358
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:53,500
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME SINCE
WE'VE STARTED OUR EXPEDITIONS

359
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:55,458
WITH D WE'VE HAD ANYTHING
COOL HAPPEN.

360
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:57,000
- WE COULD USE THE REST.

361
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:59,916
THIS IS GONNA BE A ROUGH BATTLE.
WORSE THAN YOU MIGHT THINK.

362
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,125
IT'S A SHORT COURSE,
BUT IT'S GOT ALL THESE DETAILS

363
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:03,666
THAT ARE REAL TOUGH TO NAIL.

364
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,458
- ALL THOSE SLOW
WINDING, CORNERS,

365
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:06,916
NOT BEING ABLE TO SEE
WHAT'S COMING UP NEXT,

366
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,291
FORGET ABOUT PLANNING.

367
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:10,666
- AND THE BLACKTOP'S ONE OF
THE BUMPIEST I'VE SEEN.

368
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:13,208
DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA HOW I CAN
MAKE IT THROUGH THAT SUCKER

369
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:14,916
IN JUST ONE SHOT.

370
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:22,750
HE'S ALREADY ASLEEP?
NO WAY!

371
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:25,333
IT'S LIKE HE DOESN'T EVEN FEEL
THE PRESSURE WE'RE UNDER.

372
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:26,875
MUST BE NICE.

373
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:29,500
HE MIGHT COME ACROSS AS NAIVE,
MAYBE A LITTLE DUMB,

374
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:31,500
BUT THE TRUTH IS
THE GUY'S TOUGH.

375
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:33,875
I'M THE DELICATE ONE.

376
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:43,208
- Fumihiro: WHAT IN THE HELL
IS KENTA DOING?

377
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:46,041
- HE SLATHERED OIL ALL OVER
HIS BODY TO GET A TAN.

378
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:47,625
- WHAT A FREAKIN' IDIOT.

379
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:50,750
WHY DOES HE NEED TO GET ANY
DARKER THAN HE ALREADY IS?

380
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,750
I DON'T KNOW HOW HE
CAN STAND TO BE OUT HERE.

381
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:54,166
I FEEL LIKE I'M ON FIRE.

382
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:56,916
- PROBABLY CLOSE TO A
THOUSAND DEGREES IN THE CARS.

383
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
- IT WAS A SMART IDEA GETTING
KEISUKE AND TAKUMI

384
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:01,791
TO A COOL ROOM WHERE
THEY COULD RELAX. LUCKY.

385
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:04,708
- ABSOLUTELY.
ESPECIALLY FOR THIS BATTLE.

386
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:06,583
THEY GOTTA BE IN THE
BEST SHAPE OF THEIR LIVES,

387
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:07,958
BOTH PHYSICALLY AND MENTALLY.

388
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:10,125
- RYOSUKE ALREADY HAD THE
WHOLE SHEBANG WORKED OUT

389
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:11,625
WAY BEFORE WE GOT HERE.

390
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:13,625
BUT I WOULDN'T EXPECT ANYTHING
LESS OUT OF THE GUY

391
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:14,708
NOW THAT I THINK OF IT.

392
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:16,416
- YEAH. NO DOUBT.

393
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:02,958
- MAN, FUJIWARA SURE IS
TAKING HIS SWEET ASS TIME

394
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:04,250
LOOKING OVER THE COURSE.

395
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:05,916
- HE'S BEEN GONE FOR WHAT?
AN HOUR, MAYBE TWO?

396
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,250
- YEAH, SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

397
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:08,625
AND KEISUKE WAS THERE
AND BACK IN ABOUT

398
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:09,916
AS LONG AS IT TAKES TO PISS.

399
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,208
- SO ARE YOU PLANNING ON
ACTUALLY RACING TODAY?

400
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:13,458
- ( laughs )

401
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:15,958
- HEY, SHUT UP, I GOT MY
OWN STYLE, DOUCHE BAG.

402
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:18,458
I MAY HAVE BEEN FAST, BUT
I DID EVERYTHING I HAD TO DO.

403
00:22:18,541 --> 00:22:20,208
- WELL, WE'RE ALL
COUNTING ON YOU.

404
00:22:20,291 --> 00:22:22,791
YOU'RE UP FIRST TONIGHT,
WE'D LOVE TO LEAD WITH A WIN.

405
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:24,333
- I'M READY TO GO TO BAT.

406
00:22:24,416 --> 00:22:26,458
I'VE HAD A GREAT NIGHT SLEEP
IN A COOL PLACE,

407
00:22:26,541 --> 00:22:28,541
SO I FEELIN' LIKE A
MILLION BUCKS.

408
00:23:02,541 --> 00:23:04,875
- BEEN WAITIN' FOR
THIS A LONG TIME, MAN.

409
00:23:04,958 --> 00:23:06,458
IT'S GONNA BE A
MASSIVE BLOWOUT.

410
00:23:06,541 --> 00:23:08,666
- GOOD TO SEE JOUSHIMA AND
HOSHINO STEP OUT OF THE SHADOWS

411
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,750
TO THROW DOWN IN A BATTLE
WITH THESE BADASSES DRIVERS

412
00:23:10,833 --> 00:23:12,208
FROM PROJECT D.

413
00:23:12,291 --> 00:23:13,833
IT'S A ONCE IN A
LIFETIME OPPORTUNITY

414
00:23:13,916 --> 00:23:15,583
TO SEE LEGENDS RACING LEGENDS.

415
00:23:15,666 --> 00:23:17,208
- YOU KNOW I'VE HEARD
A LOT ABOUT D,

416
00:23:17,291 --> 00:23:18,583
BUT HOW GOOD ARE THEY REALLY?

417
00:23:18,666 --> 00:23:20,666
THEY'RE GOING UP AGAINST GUYS
WHO GOT THE WORD GOD

418
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:21,583
IN THEIR NICK NAMES.

419
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:23,083
THINK THEY CAN
HOLD UP TO THAT?

420
00:23:23,166 --> 00:23:25,250
- ALL I KNOW IS THAT THEY'RE
NOT YOUR AVERAGE DRIVERS.

421
00:23:25,333 --> 00:23:28,416
BOTH GUYS THEY GOT BEHIND THE
WHEEL ARE LIKE 20 YEARS OLD,

422
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,375
AND THEY BEEN AT THIS A WHILE.

423
00:23:30,458 --> 00:23:31,583
THEY'VE BEEN ALL
OVER NORTHERN KANTOU

424
00:23:31,666 --> 00:23:33,375
AND HAVEN'T LOST ONE
SINGLE RACE YET.

425
00:23:33,458 --> 00:23:34,666
SO I'M GONNA GO OUT ON A LIMB

426
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,375
AND SAY THEY'RE
GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.

427
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:38,750
- I TELL YA, THEY BETTER BE THE
BEST IN THE FREAKIN' REGION.

428
00:23:38,833 --> 00:23:40,000
I DIDN'T COME ALL
THE WAY UP HERE

429
00:23:40,083 --> 00:23:41,875
JUST TO WATCH SOME
KIDS GET BEAT.

430
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,791
- MAN, A LOT OF PEOPLE
TURNED OUT FOR THIS ONE.

431
00:23:45,875 --> 00:23:48,083
- NOT AS MANY AS THERE'D BE
IF D STOPPED POSTING

432
00:23:48,166 --> 00:23:49,875
THE TIME AND LOCATION
OF THEIR RACES.

433
00:23:49,958 --> 00:23:52,125
THEY MUST'VE BEEN GETTIN'
TOO MANY SHOWING UP TO WATCH,

434
00:23:52,208 --> 00:23:55,833
TOO MANY DISTRACTIONS ON THE
ROAD TO HAVE A SAFE BATTLE.

435
00:23:55,916 --> 00:23:57,666
BUT THEY'VE GOT A FAN SITE UP.

436
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:59,375
THEY LEAK THE INFO IN
JUST ENOUGH TIME

437
00:23:59,458 --> 00:24:00,708
FOR PEOPLE TO MAKE THE RACE.

438
00:24:00,791 --> 00:24:03,125
- HUH? I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

439
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:06,375
MUST SUCK TO BE POPULAR.
POOR BASTARDS.

440
00:24:09,666 --> 00:24:11,666
- MY GEAR HAND'S STARTIN'
TO TWITCH.

441
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:14,125
I CAN'T WAIT TO GET OUT THERE
AND START TEARIN' THE ROAD UP.

442
00:24:14,208 --> 00:24:17,041
- EASY NOW. WATCH THAT
COCKINESS OF YOURS, BUDDY.

443
00:24:17,125 --> 00:24:18,708
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT CAN DO.

444
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:20,416
- KEEP YOUR PANTYHOSE ON.

445
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,375
THE PRIDE OF THE PURPLE SHADOW
IS A POWERFUL THING.

446
00:24:23,458 --> 00:24:25,041
I'M NOT GONNA
LOSE TO SOME KID.

447
00:24:25,125 --> 00:24:28,583
I MAYBE OLD BUT I CAN STILL
TEACH A PUNK A LESSON OR TWO.

448
00:24:30,875 --> 00:24:33,291
- Fumihiro: WE'LL DO THE HILL
CLIMB FIRST, GUYS.

449
00:24:33,375 --> 00:24:34,750
THE PYLON AT THE
TOP OF THE COURSE

450
00:24:34,833 --> 00:24:36,291
IS YOUR TURN AROUND POINT.

451
00:24:36,375 --> 00:24:39,041
ONCE YOU FLIP THAT, COME
BACK DOWN, THAT'S ONE RUN.

452
00:24:39,125 --> 00:24:41,458
AND OF COURSE WE'LL
