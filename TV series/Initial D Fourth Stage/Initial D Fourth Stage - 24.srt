8
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:15,583
HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN?

9
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:37,833
- FIVE, FOUR, THREE,

00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:40,916
TWO, ONE, GO!

11
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:47,291
- GOIN' INTO AN EIGHTH RUN.

12
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:50,583
I THOUGHT THIS BATTLE WOULD
HAVE BEEN OVER A LONG TIME AGO.

13
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:52,583
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU
BUT MY NERVES ARE SHOT.

14
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:56,083
- AFTER A BLIND ATTACK AND
A MODIFIED GUTTER RUN,

15
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:57,916
I WISH YOU COULD HAVE SEEN
THE LOOK ON GOD ARM'S FACE

16
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,958
WHEN HE SAW WHAT WAS HAPPENING.

17
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:03,916
- ME TOO, THAT MUST HAVE THROWN
A MONKEY WRENCH INTO HIS PLANS.

18
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,958
BUT WE KNEW TAKUMI WAS CAPABLE
OF THE MODIFIED GUTTER RUN.

19
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:08,333
AND IF WE KNEW IT,
THEN SO DID HE.

20
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,958
SO WHAT WAS KEEPIN HIM
FROM PULLING THAT MOVE

21
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:11,458
EARLIER IN THE RACE?

22
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:12,750
MAYBE HE WAS JUST HOLDING BACK

23
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:14,875
UNTIL IT ALL GOT
TOO TOUGH FOR HIM.

24
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:16,916
- NO, YOU'RE WRONG.

25
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,875
TRUTH IS, HE PROBABLY COULDN'T
HAVE PULLED IT OFF EARLIER

26
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:20,500
EVEN IF HE WANTED TO.

27
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:22,833
HE WAS COMPLETELY
UNDER HIS OPPONENT'S CONTROL.

28
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:24,208
BEFORE THEN HE
LACKED THE FORTITUDE

29
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:26,458
TO DO ANYTHING ON HIS OWN.

30
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:29,916
IT LOST THE GRIP ON HIS TIRES.
HE WAS AT THE EDGE OF DEFEAT.

31
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,083
IT WAS THAT MOMENT THAT
ALLOWED HIM TO PUSH HIMSELF

32
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:33,583
FOR THE FIRST TIME.

33
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:36,333
YOU COULD SAY IT WAS LIKE
TAKUMI'S ESCAPE FROM PARALYSIS.

34
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:37,916
- SURE. THAT MAKES SENSE.

35
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,208
- THIS IS WHERE
THINGS GET TOUGH.

36
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:42,625
JOUSHIMA ISN'T SO SLACK ON THE
ROAD THAT HE'D LET HIMSELF

37
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:44,333
BE FOOLED THE BY THE
SAME TRICK TWICE.

38
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,583
- Hoshino: THIS IS
TURNING SOUTH.

39
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:56,958
AN ENDURANCE WON'T
GO WELL FOR US.

40
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:58,916
IF THAT'S WHAT THIS IS,
WE'RE DONE FOR.

41
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,791
- JOUSHIMA WON'T LOSE.
HE CAN'T LOSE.

42
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:04,458
- THE GUY'S A PERFECTIONIST
LIKE YOU DON'T KNOW.

43
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:06,291
HE TRIES TO USE HIS BRAIN TO WIN

44
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:09,041
AND TO DO THAT HE STICKS
TO HIS PLAN.

45
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:11,416
I'M JUST HOPING THAT THE MONKEY
WRENCH THIS KID THREW

46
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,625
IN THE WORKS DOESN'T DESTROY
HIS CONCENTRATION.

47
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:32,083
- ( sighs )

48
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:35,166
- MY HEAD IS STILL
A TOTAL WRECK.

49
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,083
ALL I CAN DO NOW IS GUN IT.

50
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:39,500
AND PUT AS MUCH DISTANCE
BETWEEN US AS I CAN.

51
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:42,708
IT'S NOT FLASHY BUT
IT SHOULD WORK.

52
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:46,041
I'VE GOT TO DO THIS BEFORE
FATIGUE KILLS MY FOCUS.

53
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:49,958
I HAVE ONE RUN LEFT IN ME, I'LL
PULL OUT MY TIME ATTACK LINE.

54
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:01,000
- HOW MANY RUNS DEEP ARE WE?

55
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:03,791
SEVEN? NO, THIS HAS
GOTTA BE THE EIGHT.

56
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:07,041
DAMN IT, I AM NOT GOING
TO LOSE THIS GUY.

57
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:08,750
THIS IS WEARING
THE HELL OUT OF ME,

58
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:11,333
BUT IT'S GOT TO BE JUST
AS TOUGH ON HIM.

59
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:36,125
- AFTER BURNING THIS MUCH ROAD
TIME, THE MECHANICAL PROBLEMS OF

60
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:38,750
THE EIGHT-SIX START
TO BECOME A REAL CONCERN.

61
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:41,750
I MEAN, WHAT WITH HER BEING
AN OLDER MODEL CAR IN ALL.

62
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:45,708
- I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT THAT.
THE EIGHT-SIX IS A ROCK.

63
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:48,000
- A BOATLOAD OF TIME AND
MONEY HAS BEEN POURED

64
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:49,583
INTO THAT BEAUTY'S MAINTENANCE.

65
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:53,375
SHE COULD TAKE TWENTY DOWNHILLS
AND SHE WOULDN'T MISS A BEAT.

66
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:55,458
- MAKES ME FEEL BETTER.

67
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:57,833
- THE ONLY THING I'M WORRIED
ABOUT IS THE MODIFIED GUTTER RUN

68
00:05:57,916 --> 00:05:59,625
THAT USES THE CURVE.

69
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:01,666
IT'S DIFFERENT FROM
THE GUTTERS IN AKINA.

70
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,916
ALL THE STRESS HERE
GOES INTO THE SUSPENSION.

71
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,250
IT'S NOT GOOD FOR HIM
TO USE IT OVER AND OVER.

72
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:09,208
BUT FUJIWARA'S SMART.
I'M SURE HE'S FIGURED THAT OUT.

73
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:12,291
- I DUNNO. IF THAT'S THE WAY
HE'S GONNA WIN THIS RACE,

74
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:13,625
THEN HE'LL DO IT.

75
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:16,166
IT MIGHT BE A RISK WORTH TAKING.

76
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:32,125
- I'M IMPRESSED. SMOOTH RIDE.
SHE'S GOT POWER AND SHE'S FUN.

77
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:34,250
YOU CAN REALLY FEEL THE
DIFFERENCE IN STABILITY

78
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:36,750
WITH THAT FOUR WHEEL
DRIVE ANCHORING HER.

79
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:40,500
NO WONDER TAKUMI'S
BEEN SO DOWN LATELY.

80
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:42,166
I'D BE IN A SLUMP TOO IF
I HAD TO SWITCH

81
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,250
BETWEEN THIS AND THE EIGHT-SIX.

82
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,750
- HE'S BEEN WHINING ABOUT A
SLUMP AND HE MIGHT BE RIGHT,

83
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:55,625
BUT ALL THAT TELLS ME IS
HE STILL HAS A LONG WAY TO GO.

84
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:01,083
THE MOUNTAIN PASS AT AKINA'S
GOOD SOLID HOME COURSE.

85
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:02,500
BETWEEN IT AND THE EIGHT-SIX,

86
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:04,875
TAKUMI SHOULD DEVELOP
A GROUNDED OUTLOOK ON RACING

87
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:07,250
THAT'LL GIVE HIM THE CHANCE
TO LOCK DOWN HIS TECHNIQUE.

88
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:09,000
IT'S THE PERFECT
TRAINING GROUND.

89
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:11,250
- WELL IT OBVIOUSLY WORKED.

90
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:12,958
IN LESS THAN A YEAR HE
MANAGED TO MASTER

91
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:16,416
WHAT IT TAKES MOST GUYS FIVE OR
MORE TO GET DOWN.

92
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,916
- SURE DID. AND NOW WE FINALLY
REACH THE POINT ON THE SPECTRUM

93
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,416
WHERE WE NEED TO START WORKING
SERIOUSLY ON HIS TECHNIQUE.

94
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:27,083
NOTHING SPECIFIC, TEACHING HIM
TO THINK BROADER AND BE TOUGHER

95
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:30,416
AND FIND THE WELL ROUNDED RACER
THAT I KNOW IS INSIDE HIM.

96
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,708
I MEAN, FOR STARTERS,
YOU KNOW THIS,

97
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:35,750
IN A BATTLE THERE'S NO SUCH
THING AS AN ABSOLUTE STANDARD.

98
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:36,958
- MMM-HMM.

99
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:38,875
- LIKE WHEN YOU PICK
THE LINE YOU'RE DRIVING,

100
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,791
THERE MIGHT BE A PERFECT
ONE ON PAPER, BUT IN REALITY,

101
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:44,416
YOU GET OUT THERE, THERE COULD
BE DOZEN POSSIBLE LINES.

102
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,333
DEPENDS ON A HUNDRED
DIFFERENT THINGS.

103
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:48,375
- OF COURSE.
- NOT TO OVER SIMPLIFY,

104
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:50,458
BUT THE DOGFIGHT IS A BATTLE
OF WHO CAN TAKE AWAY

105
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:52,583
THE MOST LINES FROM
HIS OPPONENT.

106
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:54,291
IF YOU CAN KICK OUT YOUR
OPPONENTS LINE

107
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:55,791
WHILE HOLDING YOUR OWN,

108
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:58,458
HE'LL BE TOO BUSY TRYING TO FIX
HIS POSITION TO PASS YOU.

109
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:00,291
- THAT'S AN EXCELLENT POINT.

110
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:03,541
- A TRUE DRIVER CAN USE
WHATEVER LINE HE WANTS.

111
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:05,125
ALL I'M DOING RIGHT NOW

112
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:07,458
IS OPENING TAKUMI'S MIND
TO ADAPTABILITY.

113
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:09,166
IT'S THE BEST WAY I KNOW
TO GET HIM STARTED

114
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,125
ON DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES.

115
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:15,875
IT'S TAKEN SOME TIME BUT
YOU CAN'T DENY

116
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:17,166
THAT THERE'S BEEN RESULTS.

117
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:20,875
HE'S NOT EVEN THE SAME
PERSON HE WAS BEFORE.

118
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,541
- Yuuichi: SOUNDS LIKE
HE'S CHANGING SO MUCH,

119
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:24,583
IT'S BORDERING ON SCARY.

120
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:26,875
- KIND OF. BUT STILL...

121
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,500
THE KID HAS A LONG WAY TO GO.

122
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:42,666
- THIS IS WEIRD! THERE'S
SOMETHING DIFFERENT

123
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,541
ABOUT THIS RUN.

124
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:54,083
- I'VE NEVER PAID MUCH ATTENTION
TO MY LINES DURING A RACE.

125
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:55,875
THAT'S A ROOKIE THING.

126
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:58,458
I FOCUS ON USING THE
TIRE'S PULL POTENTIAL

127
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:00,958
AND TRYING FOR THE
BEST POSSIBLE TIME.

128
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,833
WHEN I FIRST STARTED TO PRACTICE
MY ONE HANDED STEERING,

129
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:07,208
I REALIZED THAT AS LONG AS
I DID EVERYTHING I COULD

130
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:08,625
TO SAVE MY TIRES

131
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:12,208
I'D ALWAYS LOG THE SAME
TIMES REGARDLESS OF THE LINES.

132
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:14,541
SO WHENEVER I WAS ON A
CHALLENGING STREET RACE

133
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:16,666
I WOULD ALWAYS PICK
WHICHEVER LINE I FELT

134
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,083
USED MY TIRES MOST EFFICIENTLY.

135
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:23,125
AND THERE'S MY RECORD
LINE RIGHT THERE!

136
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:26,625
TO ME LINES AREN'T
THE OBJECTIVE,

137
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:30,166
JUST THE RESULT
OF AN EXCELLENT RUN.

138
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:33,041
- I'M SEEING SOMETHING AMAZING
HAPPEN RIGHT NOW.

139
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:49,583
- YOU WANNA BE FAST
ON THE MOUNTAIN,

140
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:51,583
YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO
HAUL YOU ASS INTO A CORNER

141
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:53,375
WITH NO HESITATION AT ALL.

142
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:55,541
HOW WELL YOU KNOW THE COURSE
MATTERS ALMOST AS MUCH AS

143
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:58,125
HOW WELL YOU HANDLE
THE PRESSURE YOU'RE FEELING.

144
00:09:58,208 --> 00:09:59,875
IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE
THE FASTER DRIVER,

145
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:03,041
COURSE KNOWLEDGE IS A BASIC
POINT AND A BIG ONE.

146
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:05,500
THAT'S THE REASON I'VE PUT SO
MUCH EMPHASIS ON PRACTICE

147
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:07,083
WITH OUR EXPEDITIONS LATELY.

148
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:09,541
- WOULDN'T THAT MEAN THAT THE
DRIVERS WE'VE RACED HAVE ALWAYS

149
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:11,208
HAD THE ADVANTAGE
SINCE WE'VE BEEN RACING

150
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:12,375
ON THEIR HOME COURSES?

151
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:13,875
- OF COURSE.

152
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:16,375
EVEN MORE SO IN A RACE BETWEEN
TECHNIQUE-DRIVEN DRIVERS.

153
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:18,625
IN THAT CASE, KNOWING THE COURSE
CAN BECOME A WEAPON.

154
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:20,791
ONE THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE
TO DEFEND AGAINST.

155
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:23,833
- SO WHAT DO YOU
THINK HAPPENS TONIGHT?

156
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:25,458
- AN ENDURANCE TEST.

157
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:28,625
AND THE PERSON WHO SNAPS
FIRST IS THE LOSER.

158
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:36,208
- HE'S PULLING AWAY FROM ME?
I DON'T GET IT?

159
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:39,583
HOW'S HE DOING THAT?
WHAT AM I DOING WRONG?

160
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:43,958
THE GOAL IS CLOSE.
I'M GONNA LOSE!

161
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:54,333
- ALMOST THERE. I LOSE THIS
KID NOW AND IT'S ALL MINE.

162
00:10:56,875 --> 00:11:00,166
DAMMIT, I CAN HARDLY
FOCUS ON THE ROAD.

163
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,500
JUST A LITTLE FARTHER.

164
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:04,958
- I'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING.
ANYTHING.

165
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:06,500
I'M RUNNING OUT OF TIME!

OH NO, WHAT THE
HELL HAVE I DONE?

177
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,708
- I WONDER IF HE MESSED
UP HIS SPEED CONTROL

178
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:56,416
WHEN HE JUMPED THAT CURB.

179
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:02,333
- THE SUSPENSION'S NOT
RESPONDING. IT'S GONE!

180
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:05,750
I LOST?

181
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:15,958
- ( gags )

182
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:23,666

00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,750
- ( retching )

184
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:53,958
- Hoshino: I CANNOT BELIEVE
THAT'S HOW YOU LOST.

185
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:55,791
- I'M SORRY, MAN.

186
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:58,750
LOOK, I'M NOT MAKING EXCUSES BUT
MAYBE IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO

187
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:00,625
WITH THIS HEAT
WAVE WE'VE BEEN HAVING.

188
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:02,750
MY APPETITE HASN'T
BEEN NORMAL LATELY.

189
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:06,458
I SUSPECT IT'S ALL THIS PRESSURE
HAS MY STOMACH IN KNOTS.

190
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:08,958
BUT I NEVER WOULD HAVE
THOUGHT I'D THROW UP.

191
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:11,083
AND IN THE MIDDLE
OF A RACE NO LESS.

192
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:13,500
- I SAY YOU SHOULD'VE JUST KEPT
PUKING ALL OVER YOURSELF

193
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:14,916
AND MADE IT TO THE FINISH LINE.

194
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,125
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU HAD MUCH
FURTHER TO GO.

195
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:19,666
- THAT IS THE DUMBEST THING
I'VE EVER HEARD YOU SAY.

196
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:22,250
MY CONCENTRATION WAS BLOWN
BEFORE I KNEW IT.

197
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:25,541
THE FATIGUE HIT ME LIKE WATER
CRASHING THROUGH A BUSTED DAM.

198
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:27,291
THAT WAS IT. I WAS OUT.

199
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:29,458
- I DIDN'T KNOW YOU
WERE HURTING SO BAD.

200
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:32,583
- I HONESTLY DIDN'T EXPECT THE
RACE TO LAST AS LONG AS IT DID.

201
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:34,583
MY PLAN ENDED A RUN EARLIER.

202
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:37,208
GUESS WE SEE HOW
WELL THAT WORKED.

203
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:39,583
THEY STUCK ME WITH GOD
AS A NICKNAME.

204
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:43,083
BUT I'M JUST A MIDDLE AGED LOSER
TRYING TO KEEP MY YOUTH INTACT.

205
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:47,375
- Matsumoto: THIS COULD GET
A LITTLE TRICKY DOWN HERE.

206
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:49,041
I THINK WE OUGHT TO
GET BACK TO GUNMA

207
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:50,625
AND DO A PROPER ALIGNMENT CHECK.

208
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:52,833
- COULD IT BE DRIVEN
BACK INTO TOWN?

209
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:56,041
- AS LONG AS YOU DON'T STRESS
HER OUT, SHE SHOULD DO FINE.

210
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:57,958
- I'M SORRY I JACKED HER UP.

211
00:13:58,041 --> 00:14:01,291
- DON'T BE DOWN ON YOURSELF.
IT'LL BE FIXED IN NO TIME.

212
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:04,500
- BUT...

213
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:07,291
THAT WHY I TOLD YOU TO GO
FOR IT. YOU REMEMBER THAT?

214
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:08,708
I KNOW YOU'RE
BEATING YOURSELF UP

215
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:10,583
BECAUSE YOU THINK YOU LOST IN
TERMS OF TECHNIQUE,

216
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:13,250
BUT IN THE END YOU WON THE
BATTLE. AND THAT'S WHAT MATTERS.

217
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:17,875
- YEAH I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.
BUT I DON'T KNOW.

218
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:19,958
- IT WAS A GOOD LESSON
FOR YOU TO LEARN.

219
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:22,541
THE POINT OF THE RACE WAS TO
WATCH THE LINES.

220
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:24,541
IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN
YOUR VIEW ON LINES

221
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:26,291
HAS CHANGED TONIGHT, DIDN'T IT?

222
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:30,041
TAKE EVERYTHING YOU
LEARNED WITH YOU.

223
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:33,416
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU NEED ALL
THE ANSWERS NOW.

224
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,250
YOUR STILL GROWING, YOU KNOW,
BOTH YOU AND PROJECT D.

225
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,208
IT'S TIME TO RELAX.
TAKE A BREAK.

226
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:40,250
CONSIDERING THE CONDITION
OF THE EIGHT-SIX,

227
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:41,958
I THINK WE'LL JUST HAVE
KEISUKE'S HILL CLIMB

228
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:43,541
BE THE HEAVY ON THE TIME ATTACK.

229
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:44,875
- YEAH, SURE.

230
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:47,875
- ( engine revving )

231
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:49,250
- WE'RE COUNTIN'
ON YOU, KEISUKE.

232
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:51,541
I JUST KNOW YOU'RE GONNA
CRUSH THE RECORD TONIGHT.

233
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:52,833
- SURE, KID.

234
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:59,791
- I'VE TRIED, BUT I CAN'T THINK
OF A SINGLE THEORY OR FORMULA

235
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:02,916
THAT COULD EXPLAIN FUGIWARA'S
LUCK WHEN IT COMES TO WINNING.

236
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:10,375
LIKE WHEN HE RACED AGAINST THAT
PRO, TOMOYUKI TACHI OR TONIGHT.

237
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:11,916
THE GUY KEEPS PICKING UP WINS

238
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,541
THAT ARE NOTHING
SHORT OF MIRACULOUS.

239
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:17,083
HE'S A MYSTERY TO ME
AND EVEN TO HIMSELF.

240
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:21,041
MAYBE HE WAS BORN WITH
SOMETHING SPECIAL, A GIFT.

241
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:25,416

246
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:44,833
- Hoshino: FEELING BETTER YET?
- DON'T WORRY. I'LL LIVE.

247
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:47,041
- YOU SEEM RELAXED.
YOU READY FOR THE NEXT ROUND?

248
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:48,833
- SURE. I WAS BORN READY.

249
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:51,041
I ALMOST FEEL SORRY FOR
THE KID I'M RACING.

250
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:54,000
THERE'S NO WAY HE'LL TAG
MY RECORD IN THAT CAR.

251
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:57,625
MY GT-R COULD BE PICKED UP RIGHT
NOW AND DROPPED INTO A PRO RACE

252
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:59,916
AND I DOUBT ANYONE
WOULD SO MUCH BLINK.

253
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,916
- MAYBE SO, BUT IT WOULDN'T
EXACTLY BE A FAIR RACE.

254
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,208
IF THERE WERE ANY REGULATIONS
TO STREET RACING,

255
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:07,083
THAT WOULD CLEARLY
BE IN VIOLATION.

256
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:11,208
- NOT LIKE I CAN HELP IT.
I LOST THE BATTLE.

257
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:15,375
BUT I STILL GET TO SAVE
A LITTLE FACE IN THE END RIGHT?

258
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:18,250
SO WHAT ABOUT THE KID
ON THE DOWNHILL?

259
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:20,083
IF HE HADN'T SCREWED UP
THE EIGHT-SIX

260
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:22,375
AND HE COULD DO THE TIME ATTACK,
WHAT DO YOU THINK'D HAPPEN?

261
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:26,375
- IF THAT WAS THE CASE...
HMM...

262
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:28,791
KID MIGHT GIVE ME A
RUN FOR MY MONEY.

263
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:30,833
- I CAN'T SAY THAT'S THE
COMFORTING THING

264
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:32,375
YOU'VE EVER SAID TO ME.

265
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,833
SO THE COURSE RECORD YOU MADE
IN THE S-TWO THOUSAND

266
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:37,958
COULD BE BEATEN BY AN EIGHT-SIX?
YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS.

267
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:39,708
- SERIOUS AS A HEART ATTACK.

268
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,416
IF YOU'RE LOOKING
AT THE DOWNHILL,

269
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,625
THAT EIGHT-SIX IS A
FORCE TO BE RECKONED.

270
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:46,666
HIS SPEED WAS SOLID AND HIS
CONCENTRATION WAS UNMATCHED.

271
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:49,333
IT WAS BETTER THAN
I EVER EXPECTED.

272
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:52,416
IT MAY HAVE JUST BEEN FOR A
SECOND OR TWO, BUT AT ONE POINT

273
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,916
HE ACTUALLY FORCED ME TO GRAB
ON TO THE STEERING WHEEL

274
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,458
WITH BOTH HANDS.

275
00:16:57,541 --> 00:17:00,791
- WOW. I GET IT NOW.

276
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:03,833
I DIDN'T REALIZE
HE WAS THAT GOOD.

277
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:07,125
- TO WELD THAT AMOUNT OF SKILL
AT THAT YOUNG OF AN AGE,

278
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:09,458
IT'S A SCARY THING.

279
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:22,625
- HOW'D HE DO?
- NOT GREAT.

280
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,708
- DAMN! MAN, THAT SUCKS, ON THE
SECOND AND THIRD RUNS HE WAS

281
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:27,708
STILL IMPROVING ON
HIS PERSONAL BEST!

282
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,958
- THIS SUCKS.

283
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,083
- WE NEED TO GET BACK
TO THE CHIEF

284
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:39,875
AND REPORT THESE RESULTS SOON.

285
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:43,791
- MMM-HMM. I'M HAVING A HARD
TIME JUST STANDING HERE.

286
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:46,833
I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MUCH
I WANNA RACE THAT GUY AGAIN.

287
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:56,875
- THAT WAS TOO BAD.
- THAT KIND OF THING HAPPENS.

288
00:17:56,958 --> 00:18:00,041
- YOU CAN REALLY HANDLE
YOURSELF OUT THERE.

289
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:02,458
CAN I SAY ONE THING TO YOU?

290
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:04,166
I DON'T THINK YOU'RE THE
KIND OF DRIVER

291
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,666
WHO SHOULD STAY ON THIS SIDE OF
THINGS FOR LONG.

292
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:09,000
IF YOU WANT I COULD INTRODUCE
YOU TO THE PROPER PEOPLE,

293
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:11,333
GET YOU MOVING ON TO BIGGER
AND BETTER THINGS.

294
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:15,083
- I APPRECIATE THE
OFFER, SIR.

295
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:17,833
BUT I STILL HAVE A FEW THINGS
I FEEL LIKE I NEED TO ACCOMPLISH

296
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:19,541
WHERE I AM RIGHT NOW.

297
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:27,833
- THAT'S FINE. IT'S NOT LIKE
I CAN FORCE YOU INTO IT.

298
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:29,500
SEE YA 'ROUND.

299
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:35,916
- WE STILL HAVE A
LONG ROAD AHEAD.

300
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:39,708
THERE ARE STILL BETTER
DRIVERS OUT THERE.

301
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,583
- EXCUSE ME.

302
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:55,333
- BEFORE WE START I SHOULD WARN
YOU MY STYLE IS ORIGINAL AND

303
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:58,875
COMPLETELY SELF-TAUGHT, SO YOU
WON'T SEE IT ANYWHERE ELSE.

304
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:02,041
I'LL SHOW YOU BUT I CAN'T
PROMISE YOU THAT YOU WON'T GET

305
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:04,166
THAT MUCH OUT OF IT.

306
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:08,000
- GOD ARM'S GONNA LET HIM RIDE
SHOTGUN. GENEROUS MOVE.

307
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:11,083
- AND SURPRISINGLY ENOUGH
HE ALMOST JUMPED AT THE IDEA.

308
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:12,541
BETWEEN US, FUMIHIRO,

309
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:15,375
I WISH IT WAS ME SITTING IN
JOUSHIMA'S PASSENGER SEAT.

310
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:17,166
- YOU READY TO GO?

311
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:19,583
- ANYTIME YOU ARE.

312
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:24,708
- NOW THAT'S A HELL OF
A RARE EXPERIENCE.

313
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:27,750
I DOUBT ANYONE'S HAD THE
PRIVILEGE FUJIWARA ENJOYING.

314
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:31,458
HE GETS TO WATCH JOUSHIMA'S
TECHNIQUE UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL.

315
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:33,333
- Fumihiro: LUCKY HIM.

316
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:34,791
- THOSE TWO ARE
SIMILAR MORE THAN

317
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:36,333
EITHER ONE OF THEM MIGHT THINK.

318
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:40,458
THE IMPACT ON FUJIWARA
COULD BE ENORMOUS.

319
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:41,708
THE AMAZING THING
ABOUT HIS STEERING

320
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:45,000
ISN'T THAT HE'S DOES
IT WITH ONE HAND.

321
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:47,416
YOU NEED TO LOOK AT HOW
HE'S DOING IT, FUJIWARA.

322
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:57,583
THE BATTLES FOR D
WILL CONTINUE.

323
00:19:57,666 --> 00:19:59,291
YOU NEED TO BURN
EVERYTHING YOU SEE TONIGHT

324
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:01,125
INTO YOUR BRAIN AND LET IT SCAR.

325
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:03,458
YOU'RE GOING TO NEED IT.

326
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:06,666
AND MANY MORE DIFFICULT
BATTLES THAT LIE AHEAD.

327
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:10,000
YOU'RE GONNA FIGURE OUT
HOW TO USE IT ALL SOMEDAY.

328
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:22,000
- HERE WE ARE...
- THE THREE OF US...

329
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:24,000
- LONELY AGAIN.

330
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:27,666
- ( all groaning )

331
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,208
- YOU KNOW IF I SAW A GIRL
NEAR ANY ONE OF YOU,

332
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:31,875
I MIGHT DIE FROM THE SHOCK.

333
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:34,458
- DON'T SAY THAT, BOSS.
WE FEEL BAD ENOUGH.

334
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:36,541
- WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE I HAD
AT LEAST TWO CHICKS

335
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:38,041
AROUND ME AT ALL TIMES.

336
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:40,250
I DIDN'T HAVE A FRIDAY NIGHT
TO MYSELF TILL I WAS TWENTY.

337
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:41,583
- I WONDER IF ONE OF US EMITS

338
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:43,291
SOME KIND OF FEMALE-REPELLING
PHEROMONE.

339
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:45,458
LIKE THE OPPOSITE OF
THOSE COLOGNES.

340
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:46,583
- MAYBE.

341
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:50,708
- HEY! WHAT ARE YOU ASSHOLES
LOOKIN' AT ME FOR!

342
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:55,333
- HEY, LOOK! IT'S TAKUMI!

343
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:57,833
- SO, WE HEARD YOU
WON ANOTHER BIG RACE!

344
00:20:57,916 --> 00:21:02,291
- YEAH. NOT SO MUCH A WIN.
IT WAS MORE OF A TIE.

345
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:05,875
- DON'T BE SO MODEST.
A WIN IS STILL A WIN, MAN!

346
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:07,166
- IF YOU'D BEEN THERE TO SEE IT,

347
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:08,916
I DON'T THINK YOU'D
BE SAYING THAT.

348
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,916
- GOT THE IMPREZA?
WHERE'S THE EIGHT-SIX?

349
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,708
- I BLEW THE EIGHT-SIX'S
SUSPENSION AT THE END

350
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:15,333
OF THE RACE LAST NIGHT.

351
00:21:15,416 --> 00:21:17,208
SHE'S BEIN' REPAIRED
AS WE SPEAK.

352
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:19,708
- WAIT SO YOU'RE TELLING
ME YOUR FREE TODAY?

353
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:21,291
- LOOKS LIKE IT.

354
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:23,375
- THEN CLIMB OFF YOUR THRONE AND
GO FOR A DRIVE WITH US FOR ONCE.

355
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:26,041
HEY IKETANI, KENJI,
WHAT DO YOU GUYS SAY?

356
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:27,791
- YEAH. THAT SOUNDS LIKE FUN.

357
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:30,416
AND MAYBE TAKUMI CAN TEACH
ME SOME OF HIS MOVES.

358
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,833
- HEY, ME TOO.

359
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:33,791
- AND SINCE WE DON'T HAVE
ANY CHICKS TO TIE US DOWN

360
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:36,500
WE CAN MAKE THIS A BOYS NIGHT!

361
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:38,375
- ( all laughing )

362
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:40,625
- FOUR YOUNG MEN AND NOT
A GIRLFRIEND IN THE BUNCH,

363
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:41,958
IT'S ALMOST TRAGIC.

364
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:44,208
- I HOPE THEY CAN PUT AN
END TO THIS DROUGHT SOON.

365
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:45,583
YOU NEVER LOSE.

366
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:48,166
- THERE'S NO SECRET.
I JUST TRY TO DRIVE MY HARDEST

367
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,916
NO MATTER WHO I'M UP AGAINST
OR WHERE I AM.

368
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,375
- YOU DOG.

369
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:54,791
- QUIT ACTIN' LIKE THAT, MAN.
I JUST RACE CARS.

370
00:21:57,541 --> 00:22:01,791
I KNOW IT SOUNDS TOO EASY,
BUT IT'S WHAT WORKS BEST FOR ME.

371
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:04,833
I STILL HAVE SO MUCH LEFT
THAT I WANT TO ACCOMPLISH

372
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:07,250
AND THE ROAD AHEAD OF ME
IS GOING TO BE A LONG ONE.

373
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:19,708
- ( upbeat music playing )

374
00:22:33,791 --> 00:22:35,583
- SHE'S ALL FIXED UP?

375
00:22:35,666 --> 00:22:39,083
- YEP, I GOT HER
BACK LAST NIGHT.

376
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:40,541
- GOOD.

377
00:22:44,208 --> 00:22:45,916
HERE YA GO.

378
00:22:49,583 --> 00:22:51,916
- SEE YA LATER, DAD.
- YEAH.

379
00:22:56,541 --> 00:23:01,250
HMM. I DON'T CARE WHAT HE SAYS
HE LOVES DRIVING THAT THING.

380
00:23:01,333 --> 00:23:02,833
I CAN TELL.

381
00:23:05,333 --> 00:23:07,291
- ( yawning )

382
00:23:17,583 --> 00:23:21,000
- YOU'RE AN EXCELLENT DRIVER
BUT STILL ISN'T EVERYTHING.

383
00:23:21,083 --> 00:23:23,250
AND IT'S UNBELIEVABLY
HARD TO MAINTAIN

384
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:26,291
ONCE YOU DECIDE YOU'RE TOO
GOOD TO PRACTICE.

385
00:23:31,583 --> 00:23:33,875
IF YOU DON'T HAVE
YOUR EYES FORWARD,

386
00:23:33,958 --> 00:23:36,125
CONSTANTLY LOOKING AT
WHERE YOUR HEADED,

387
00:23:36,208 --> 00:23:38,791
YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO
REACH THE NEXT LEVEL.

388
00:23:40,541 --> 00:23:42,791
AND IF YOU ASK ME
THAT A BIG PART

389
00:23:42,875 --> 00:23:46,291
IT TAKES TO BECOME A MASTER.

390
00:23:46,375 --> 00:23:48,083
ME. I'M OLD NOW,

391
00:23:48,166 --> 00:23:51,541
THE BEST I CAN DO IS
MAINTAIN WHAT I HAVE.

392
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:56,833
BUT YOU'RE STILL YOUNG, KID,

393
00:23:56,916 --> 00:23:58,458
YOU CAN AIM HIGHER.

394
00:23:58,541 --> 00:24:01,416
AND YOU SHOULD, EVERY DAY.

395
00:24:04,958 --> 00:24:08,458
EVEN IF YOU CAN ONLY TAKE AWAY
THE SMALLEST IDEA ABOUT

396
00:24:08,541 --> 00:24:11,208
WHAT I DO FROM RIDING
SHOTGUN WITH ME TODAY,

397
00:24:11,291 --> 00:24:13,250
I'LL BE VERY HAPPY WITH THAT.

398
00:24:13,333 --> 00:24:15,250
IT'LL MEAN THAT YOU
AND I MEETING EACH OTHER

399
00:24:15,333 --> 00:24:17,958
HAD MORE THAN A
LITTLE SIGNIFICANCE.

400
00:24:21,541 --> 00:24:22,875
- I KNOW YOU'RE BEATING
YOURSELF UP

401
00:24:22,958 --> 00:24:24,875
BECAUSE YOU THINK YOU LOST IN
TERMS OF TECHNIQUE,

402
00:24:24,958 --> 00:24:27,583
BUT IN THE END YOU WON THE
BATTLE. AND THAT'S WHAT MATTERS.

403
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:29,583
TAKE EVERYTHING YOU
LEARNED WITH YOU.

404
00:24:29,666 --> 00:24:31,916
ISN'T LIKE YOU NEED TO KNOW
ALL THE ANSWERS NOW.

405
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,250
YOU'RE STILL GROWING, YOU KNOW.
YOU AND PROJECT D.

406
00:24:35,333 --> 00:24:40,458
- WHAT RYOSUKE SAID WAS RIGHT.
HE'S ALWAYS RIGHT.

407
00:24:40,541 --> 00:24:42,000
- Ryosuke: YOU NEED TO BURN
EVERY YOU SEE TONIGHT

408
00:24:42,083 --> 00:24:44,208
IN YOUR BRAIN AND LET IT SCAR.

409
00:24:44,291 --> 00:24:45,541
YOU'RE GONNA NEED IT,

410
00:24:45,625 --> 00:24:48,500
THERE'S MANY MORE BATTLES
THAT LIE AHEAD.

411
00:24:48,583 --> 00:24:51,916
AND WHEN THE TIME COMES ALONG
YOU'LL BE READY.

412
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,958
- THERE'S STILL A LOT OF
OBSTACLES TO OVERCOME.

413
00:24:55,041 --> 00:24:57,000
TOO MANY TO COUNT.

414
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:02,958
BUT I'M GOING TO GET
PAST THEM, ONE AT A TIME,

415
00:25:03,041 --> 00:25:05,833
IN MY EIGHT-SIX.
AND WITH PROJECT D.

416
00:25:21,916 --> 00:25:24,333
- ( theme song playing )

417
00:25:24,416 --> 00:25:26,416
- ( singing in Japanese )

418
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:13,250
- ♪ NOBODY REASON ♪

419
00:26:13,333 --> 00:26:17,208
♪ NOBODY IS SURE
WHERE IS THE END ♪

420
00:26:41,916 --> 00:26:45,416
♪ NOBODY REASON ♪

421
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:48,833
♪ NOBODY IS SURE
WHERE IS THE END ♪

422
00:26:58,458 --> 00:27:01,375
♪ NOBODY REASON ♪

423
00:27:01,458 --> 00:27:05,291
♪ NO ONE CONFESS THAT
IT WAS WRONG ♪
