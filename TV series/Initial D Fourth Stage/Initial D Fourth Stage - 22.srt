YES! KEISUKE DID IT!
HE WON! YEAH!

8
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:14,416
- THE END OF THAT RUN FELT
A LITTLE SCREWY TO ME.

9
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,166
WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE GO FOR A THIRD ONE.

10
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:19,375
- NO WAY. THAT WAS MY LOSS
FAIR AND SQUARE.

11
00:02:19,458 --> 00:02:22,041
PLUS MY TIRES ARE
COMPLETELY SHREDDED.

12
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:24,041
AND SORRY I SLAMMED
INTO YOU BACK THERE.

00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:26,916
I COULDN'T HOLD THE ROAD ANY
LONGER. SHE SLIPPED AWAY.

NO MATTER WHAT I DID TO BRING
HER BACK UNDER CONTROL

15
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:31,375
AFTER THAT DRIFT,
IT DIDN'T WORK.

16
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:34,375
TOO BAD REALLY,

17
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:36,708
BUT I CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER THE
LAST TIME I WAS THIS PUMPED

18
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:38,041
AFTER A BATTLE.

19
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:40,291
EVERYTHING LEFT MY
HEAD AND ALL I COULD FOCUS ON

20
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:41,875
WAS THE FIGHT
WITH MY STEERING WHEEL.

21

- ( chuckles )

22
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:45,583
- NICE WIN, KID.

23
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:53,916
WATCH YOURSELF
OUT THERE, JOSHIMA.

24
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,541
THESE BOYS ARE A LOT BETTER
THAN WE THOUGHT THEY'D BE.

25
00:02:56,625 --> 00:02:58,458
- THANKS FOR THE TIP, BIG GUY.

26
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:04,291
- ( sighs )
- IT'S A HOT NIGHT.

27
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:06,416
AND IT'S ONLY GONNA GET HOTTER.

28
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:16,583
- Iketani: GOOD WORK
TODAY, GUYS.

29
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:18,416
- LATER ON EVERYBODY.

30
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:26,208
- ( both panting )

31
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:27,333
- IT'S SO FREAKIN' HOT.

32
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:29,541
- I KNOW. WHO TURNED ON
THE FURNACE?

33
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:31,458
PROJECT D MUST BE HAVING
A HELL OF A TIME

34
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:33,541
KEEPING THEIR ENGINES COOL.

35
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:36,291
- IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE
THIS HOT AT NIGHT, MAN.

36
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:37,875
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE
AND FIND SOMEPLACE

37
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:40,541
WHERE THEY HAVE SOME
ARCTIC-STYLE AIR-CONDITIONING.

38
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:41,666
- GREAT IDEA.

39
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:47,666

00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:50,041

41
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:52,041
- THAT HITS THE SPOT!

42
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:54,041
- GOOD FOR YOU.
SO HAVE YOU HEARD ANYTHING

43
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:55,458
ABOUT WHERE TAKUMI
AND PROJECT D

44
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:57,000
ARE SUPPOSED TO BE
RACING TONIGHT?

45
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:58,791
- YEAH, OVER IN IBARAKI.

46
00:03:58,875 --> 00:03:59,875
KENJI TOLD ME
THEY'RE UP AGAINST

47
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:01,375
SOME SERIOUSLY
TOUGH OLD DRIVERS.

48
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:03,583
BUT THEY DIDN'T SAY
WHO THEY WERE.

49
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:08,083
WELL, WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT
THAT. HERE'S KENJI NOW.

50
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:10,750
- YO!

51
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:13,291
IS THIS HEAT KILLIN' YOU AS
MUCH AS IT IS US? I'M MELTING.

52
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:15,375
- DON'T TRY TO GIVE ME
THAT LINE OF CRAP.

53
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:16,708
YOU'RE JUST ALL WORKED UP

54
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:18,458
FROM BEING OUT HERE ON
YOUR HOT DATE WITH ITSUKI.

55
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:19,875
- ON MY DATE WITH ITSUKI--

56
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:22,791
- SO DO YOU HAVE FUN
DOING THAT?

57
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:23,916
- Boy 1: YEAH, USUALLY.

58
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,125
- COOL.
- OH YEAH?

59
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:27,166
- I COULDN'T BELIEVE
SHE SAID THAT TO HIM.

60
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:33,166
- ( sighs )

61
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,208
- WHY IS IT THAT WE'RE THE ONLY
TABLE IN THE WHOLE PLACE

62
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:36,208
WITH JUST GUYS?

63
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:37,666
- THE WHOLE WORLD IS HOOKING UP

64
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,708
AND WE'RE AT OUR OWN
PRIVATE SAUSAGE FEST.

65
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:41,833
- Girl 1: SHUT UP, PERVERT!

66
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:45,333
- LOOKIN' AROUND, IT'S THE SAME
FACES. NOT ONE NEW OPPORTUNITY.

67
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:47,958
- I'M YOUNG AND CUTE, I'M NOT
SUPPOSE TO LIVE LIKE THIS.

68
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:50,000
YOU DON'T THINK THE THREE OF US
SITTING HERE TOGETHER

69
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:52,541
ON DATE NIGHT
MAKES US LOOK KINDA...

70
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:55,208
- HELL, NO! BUT WHAT KINDA
OPTIONS DO WE HAVE?

71
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:57,125
- YOU DON'T NEED TO GET
ALL PISSY ABOUT IT, MAN.

72
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:58,625
- Girl 2: WHERE DO YOU
FEEL LIKE GOIN'?

73
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:00,083
Boy 2: SOMEPLACE WE CAN
BE ALONE, BABY.

74
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,333
- OK, JUST NOT YOUR PLACE!

75
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:05,750
- I'M EVEN HOTTER IN
HERE THAN I WAS OUTSIDE!

76
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:08,458
- LOOK, GUYS,
WE'RE STREET RACERS.

77
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:10,625
WE GOT BIGGER THINGS
ON OUR MINDS THAN DATING.

78
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:15,541
- BUT WE STILL WANT GIRLFRIENDS.

79
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:16,958
- THIS SUCKS.

80
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:20,125
TAKUMI'S KNEE DEEP IN A BATTLE,
REPUTATION ON THE LINE.

81
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:23,416
IS IT REALLY COOL FOR US TO
BE FEELIN' SORRY FOR OURSELVES?

82
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,125
- OF COURSE,
IT'S NOT DUDE.

83
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:26,583
- I KNOW.

84
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:55,166
- I'M COUNTING ON YOU BOYS.
- YES, SIR!

85
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:02,541
- WHAT POSITION WOULD YOU LIKE
TO START IN FOR THE FIRST RUN?

86
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:04,000
- CHASE IF YOU DON'T MIND.

87
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:06,875
STARTING FROM BEHIND WOULD BE
A NICE CHANGE OF PACE.

88
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:08,250
- THAT'LL WORK.

89
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:10,500
HEY, FUJIWARA, YOU'LL BE
LEADING THE FIRST RUN!

90
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,541
- JOSHIMA.
NICE TO MEET YOU, SON.

91
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:19,541
- TAKUMI. IT'S NICE TO
MEET YOU TOO, SIR.

92
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:21,541
- MIND IF I ASK YOU A QUESTION?

93
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:23,125
- SHOOT.

94
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:25,791
- I WAS JUST WONDERING WHY AT
SUCH A YOUNG AGE A KID LIKE YOU

95
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:27,500
WOULD CHOOSE TO
DRIVE AN EIGHT-SIX.

96
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,166
IT MIGHT NOT SEEM LIKE
MUCH TO YOU,

97
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,791
BUT IT'S OF GREAT
INTEREST TO ME.

98
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:32,833
- SORRY TO DISAPPOINT YOU
BUT IT WASN'T MY DECISION

99
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:34,041
TO DRIVE THE EIGHT-SIX

100
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:37,208
IN THE FIRST PLACE.
USED TO BE MY FATHER'S.

101
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:39,291
- YOUR FATHER'S, HUH?
- YEAH.

102
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:41,958
SHE'S BEEN IN THE FAMILY
FOR ALMOST AS I CAN REMEMBER

103
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:43,416
AND SINCE SHE WAS
ALL THAT WE HAD

104
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,916
SHE'S WHAT I ENDED UP DRIVING.

105
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,250
- HUH.

106
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:48,541
- I GUESS I'VE GOTTEN
KINDA ATTACHED TO HER.

107
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:51,166
I WAS DRIVING THIS BABY WAY
BEFORE I EVEN HAD MY LICENSE.

108
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,541
HMM, HOW INTERESTING.

109
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:55,541
THEN I GUESS
YOU MUST HAVE LEARNED

110
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:56,916
EVERYTHING YOU KNOW ABOUT
DRIVING FROM YOUR FATHER,

111
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,750
I ASSUME HE TAUGHT YOU.

112
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:03,708
- WELL, I GUESS YOU
COULD PUT IT LIKE THAT.

113
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:05,583
- I CERTAINLY WOULDN'T MIND
MEETING YOUR FATHER

114
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:07,000
ONE OF THESE DAYS.

115
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:09,125
I HAVE A FEELING HE AND
I WOULD GET ALONG PRETTY WELL.

116
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:15,541
OF COURSE THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT
I'LL BE TAKING IT EASY ON YOU.

117
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:21,166
- I HOPE YOU DON'T, SIR.

118
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:27,541
- ( people chattering )

119
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:39,166
- RYOSUKE, WE'RE READY TO
ROLL OFF THE LINE ANYTIME.

120
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,625
- GOOD TO KNOW.

121
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:45,333
I WANT YOU TO LISTEN TO ME
CAREFULLY, TAKUMI.

122
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:46,500
- YEAH?

123
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:47,916
- I'M GONNA BE STRAIGHT
WITH YOU.

124
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,583
THE GUY YOU'RE GOIN' UP
AGAINST IS FAR AND AWAY

125
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:51,000
THE BEST YOU'VE EVER FACED.

126
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:53,708
NOT A CHINK
IN HIS ARMOR.

127
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:56,875
I ONLY HAVE ONE PIECE OF ADVICE
FOR YOU BEFORE YOU ROLL OFF.

128
00:07:57,958 --> 00:07:59,000
TOUGH IT OUT.

129
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:02,833
YOU MIGHT NOT THINK YOU CAN WIN,
BUT STICK TO YOUR GUNS,

130
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:05,208
YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY
PULL THIS OFF.

131
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:06,833
I'LL BE ABLE TO SAY MORE LATER

132
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:08,833
BUT FOR NOW I WANT YOU TO
JUST CONCENTRATE ON THE ROAD

133
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:10,625
AND NOT YOUR OPPONENT.

134
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:13,958
REMEMBER, YOU AREN'T RACING
A MAN, YOUR RACING A GHOST.

135
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:15,541
- HUH!

136
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:17,500
- DON'T FORGET THAT.

137
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:23,333
START 'EM UP, FUMIHIRO.

138
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:24,666
- YOU GOT IT.

139
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:27,791
HERE WE GO, GUYS!

140
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:32,250
FIVE! FOUR! THREE!
TWO! ONE!

141
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:33,708
- A GHOST, HUH?

142
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:34,750
- GO!

143
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:53,375
- RIGHT, I HEAR YA.

144
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:56,291
OK, THEY STARTED THE FIRST RUN
OF THE DOWNHILL A MINUET AGO.

145
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:57,333
- HMM.

146
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:05,125
IT'S ALL UP TO YOU NOW.
TIME TO EARN THE NAME GOD ARM.

147
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:07,000
YOU GOTTA PUT IT ALL
INTO THIS ONE.

148
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:09,291
EVERYTHING THAT
MADE YOU A LEGEND.

149
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,000
- HEY, KEISUKE.
-YEAH?

150
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,625
- DO YOU THINK TAKUMI'S
GONNA BE OKAY OUT THERE?

151
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,041
- SWEATIN' ABOUT ITS SURE ISN'T
GONNA HELP. THIS IS HIS RACE.

152
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:24,083
WE GOT TO LET HIM RUN IT.

153
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:25,958
- ( tires screeching )

154
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:41,708
- Sakai: CHIEF TOLD
ME SOMETHIN'.

155
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:43,458
SAID EVERYTHING THAT MAKES
JOSHIMA SUCH A RACING LEGEND

156
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:44,541
IS IN HIS STEERING TECHNIQUE.

157
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,375
WHICH IS PRETTY DAMN IMPRESSIVE.

158
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:48,625
THE UNIQUE THING ABOUT HIM IS
THAT HE LEAVES HIS LEFT HAND

159
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:51,208
ON THE SHIFTER AND USES ONLY HIS
RIGHT HAND TO STEER.

160
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:52,458
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU

161
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:54,916
BUT I'VE NEVER HEARD OF ANYBODY
WHO CAN DO THAT.

162
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:02,083
- YEAH, BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT'S THE PURPOSE OF IT?

163
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:03,500
I'D FEEL ALL KINDS OF WEIRD

164
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:05,125
IF I HAD TO STEER WITHOUT
HOLDING THE WHEEL

165
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:06,416
WITH BOTH HANDS.

166
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:12,916
WAIT A SEC. IF THE GUY'S ONLY
USIN' ONE HAND TO STEER WITH,

167
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,833
THEN HE'S GONNA RUN INTO
CORNERS ON THE MOUNTAIN

168
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:16,375
WHERE HE WON'T BE ABLE
TO SPIN THE WHEEL ENOUGH

169
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:17,541
TO TURN THE CAR.

170
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:19,583
THE PASS IS FULL OF
PLACES LIKE THAT.

171
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:21,625
THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT
OF THESE KINDS OF RACES.

172
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:23,750
- THAT'S WHY THE GUY'S NICKNAME
IS 'GOD ARM'.

173
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:25,500
HE'S CALLED THE SORCERER OF
THE STEERING WHEEL

174
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,541
FOR A GOOD FREAKIN' REASON.

175
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:35,833
- THIS GUY'S INCREDIBLY
FREAKIN' FAST.

176
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:40,541
- JUST LIKE I FIGURED.
THIS KID'S PRETTY GOOD.

177
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:50,458
- THAT'S IT.
HE'S GOTTA BE DRIFTING.

178
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:52,500
I KNOW IT'S A DIFFICULT
TECHNIQUE TO MASTER,

179
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:54,916
BUT WITH THE MINIMAL STEERING
OF A ZERO-COUNTER DRIFT,

180
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,708
PULL IT OFF.

181
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:57,125
- HE PROBABLY COULD.

182
00:10:57,208 --> 00:11:00,000
BUT JOSHIMA DOESN'T DO ANY
DRIFTING MANEUVERS AT ALL.

183
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:02,666
HE'S GOT A DIFFERENT
STYLE ALTOGETHER.

184
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,791
IT'S SOMEWHERE BETWEEN
DRIFT AND GRIPING.

185
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:08,500
- WAIT, HE SPLITS BETWEEN
DRIFTING AND GRIPPING?

186
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:10,625
YOU MEAN IT'S NOT
EITHER ONE OF 'EM?

187
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:16,375
- ALL OF YOU SEEM TO THINK

188
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:17,750
THAT JOSHIMA'S ONE HANDED
STEERING TECHNIQUE

189
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:19,416
IS A WEIRD THING TO DO.

190
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,208
BUT IT MAKES A
HELLUVA LOT MORE SENSE

191
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:23,125
THAN YOU MIGHT THINK IT DOES.

192
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:25,375
YOU JUST NEED TO KNOW HOW
LITTLE YOU GOTTA STEER

193
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:27,000
IN ORDER TO TURN THE CAR.

194
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:29,250
AND AFTER TWENTY YEARS
OF SOLID PRACTICE,

195
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:32,166
JOSHIMA'S GOT IT JUST
ABOUT PERFECTED.

196
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:47,291
HE HAD TO PUT A LOT OF THOUGHT
INTO THIS.

197
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:49,750
HE DIDN'T GET TO WHERE HE IS
JUST BY WINGING IT.

198
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:52,541
THIS WAS ALL CAREFUL PLANNING.

199
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:55,000
HE'LL SWEAR UP AND DOWN
THAT WHAT HE'S DOING OUT THERE

200
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:57,375
ISN'T DRIFT OR GRIP,
BUT SOMETHING ELSE.

201
00:11:57,458 --> 00:11:59,083
BUT IF YOU'RE ASKING ME,

202
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:06,708
I SAY WHAT THE GUY'S DOING IS
THE IDEAL DRIFT.

203
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:39,458
- THE BEST HIGH-LEVEL TECHNIQUES
ARE THE ONES YOU CAN DO

204
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:42,541
WHEN YOUR OPPONENT'S
NOT EXPECTING IT.

205
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:43,958
TIRES ARE ALWAYS AT THEIR BEST

206
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:45,666
WHEN THEY HAVE THE G'S PUSHING
DOWN ON THEM,

207
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,041
WHEN THEY'RE ON THE
VERGE OF SKIDDING

208
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:48,291
AND THE PRESSURES IS PERFECT,

209
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:50,500
IT MAKES THE CAR SAIL
LIKE IT'S ON THE WIND.

210
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:51,916
- RIGHT.

211
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,875
- MY GUESS IS THE GUY'S LETTIN'
HIS TIRES SKID A LITTLE.

212
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:56,458
JUST ENOUGH THAT
IT'S ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLE.

213
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:58,041
IT'S ONLY A THEORY
BUT IT'S THE ONLY WAY

214
00:12:58,125 --> 00:12:59,875
I CAN WRAP MY HEAD AROUND IT.

215
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:02,708
- ALRIGHT. I PROBABLY
COULDN'T DO IT MYSELF

216
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:05,416
BUT IF'S THERE'S A MIX OF
DRIFT AND GRIP, THAT BE IT.

217
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:08,083
- CHIEF KNOWS ALL ABOUT IT.

218
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:09,583
THE TOUDOU SCHOOL
AND PURPLE SHADOW

219
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:11,500
HAVE BEEN RIVALS
FOR A LONG TIME.

220
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,916
NOT A LOT OF SECRETS ANYMORE.

221
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,875
WE'VE GONE HEAD-TO-HEAD WITH
THEIR YOUNGER MEMBERS

222
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:17,666
AT CIRCUITS, STREET
GATHERINGS, WHERE EVER,

223
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,541
YOU NAME IT, WE'VE BEEN THERE,
AND RACED 'EM HARD.

224
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:22,291
BUT THE ELITE FROM
THE PURPLE SHADOW

225
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:23,958
GOING FOR BROKE ON THE STREET,

226
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:25,833
WE MISS THE OPPORTUNITY
TO SEE THIS,

227
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:29,375
WE MAY NEVER GET THE CHANCE TO
SEE IT AGAIN IN OUR LIFETIMES.

228
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:32,250
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK CHIEF WAS
REALLY TRYING TO TELL US?

229
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:34,541
"WATCH THOSE GUYS LIKE A HAWK.

230
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:37,791
"KEEP YOUR EYES ON EVERY SINGLE
THING THAT GOD ARM JOSHIMA

231
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:40,208
AND GOD FOOT HOSHINO DO."

232
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:44,583
- SO, FUMIHIRO, QUESTION?

233
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:46,458
YOU REMEMBER A GUY
CALLED SHINGO SHOUJI

234
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:48,000
WHO RACED FOR THE NIGHT KIDS?

235
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:50,875
HE WAS THE ONE WITH PENSION
FOR GUMTAPE DEATH MATCHES.

236
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:54,625
- SHOUJI? YEAH, I DO.

237
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,333
HE WAS THE GUY WHO WOULD
TAPE HIS RIGHT HAND

238
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:59,375
TO THE STEERING WHEEL. CRAZY.

239
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:02,958
- IN THOSE RACES,
ONLY A STEERING WHEEL

240
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:04,375
WITH A LIMITED RANGE IS ALLOWED.

241
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:05,625
IT'S PART OF THE CHALLENGE.

242
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:08,000
THAT WAY YOU TURN
BY USING YOUR ACCELERATOR.

243
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:09,958
IT'S TOUGH BUT I'M
WILLING TO BET

244
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:12,666
THAT JOSHIMA'S SIGNATURE ONE
HANDED STEERING TECHNIQUE

245
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,500
PROBABLY HAS IT'S ROOTS
IN THE SAME THEORY

246
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:16,875
AS GUMTAPE DEATH MATCH IS.

247
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,625
THE TWO TECHNIQUES
MAY BE EVEN ONE IN THE SAME,

248
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:24,916
ONLY JOSHIMA'S VERSION IS
MORE COMPLETE OR REFINED.

249
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,291
- BUT I DON'T GET IT. I MEAN,
WHAT'S THE POINT OF IT

250
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:29,708
BESIDES LETTING YOUR LEFT HAND
CONCENTRATE ON THE SHIFT WORK,

251
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:32,083
WHICH DOESN'T SEEM
ALL THAT IMPORTANT.

252
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:33,916
- IF YOU WANT THE REAL ANSWER
TO THAT QUESTION,

253
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,250
THEN I SUPPOSE YOU'RE GOING
TO HAVE TO ASK JOSHIMA HIMSELF.

254
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:39,500
I'M NOT SAYING THAT
IT'S NOT UNUSUAL, IT IS,

255
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:41,916
AND IT PROBABLY
WOULDN'T BENEFIT MOST RACERS.

256
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,916
ONE OF THE TOP DRIVERS
IN THE WRC USE

257
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,541
TO UTILIZE THE
SAME TECHNIQUE

258
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:47,333
AND HE WAS THE BEST
IN HIS CLASS.

259
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:57,125
- SOMETHING ABOUT THIS RACE
FEELS SO FAMILIAR.

260
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:58,958
I KNOW THIS KIND OF PRESSURE,

261
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:01,708
THE KIND THAT STICKS TO
EVERY TURN I MAKE.

262
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:03,875
IT'S LIKE MY DAD'S BACK THERE
IN THE IMPREZA

263
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:05,791
BREATHING DOWN MY NECK.

264
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:31,791
- LIKE, CAN I TELL YOU
WHO'S GONNA WIN IT?

265
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:32,958
- YEAH.

266
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:34,541
- IT WOULDN'T BE EASY.

267
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:36,083
IT ISN'T LIKE THIS THING IS
GONNA WRAP UP

268
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:37,916
IN JUST A RUN OR TWO.

269
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,833
- YOU DON'T THINK?

270
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:40,083
- IT'S NOT A LONG COURSE

271
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:41,916
BUT ALL THE HOOKS AND
CORNERS MAKE IT TOUGH

272
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,166
AND THERE AREN'T MANY
STRAIGHT SHOTS

273
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,583
TO CATCH A GOOD RHYTHM.

274
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:46,458
THIS IS GOING TO TURN
INTO A LONG BATTLE

275
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:49,416
WHETHER THEY WANT IT TO OR NOT.

276
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,375
BUT IF IT WAS OVER FAST AND
DON'T GET ME WRONG, KENTA,

277
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:55,291
I'M PUTTIN' A TRUCKLOAD OF
STRESS ON THE WORD 'IF' HERE,

278
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:59,541
THEN TAKUMI WOULD
PROBABLY LOSE.

279
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:03,041
DON'T GET HYSTERICAL. ALL I'M
SAYIN' IS THAT TAKUMI'S BEST BET

280
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:05,541
OF A WIN IS DRAGGING THIS OUT
FOR AS LONG AS HE CAN.

281
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:08,875
I JUST HOPE HE REALIZES THAT.

282
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:11,083
THE OTHER GUY'S GONNA BE
LEADING IN THE NEXT RUN.

283
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:13,000
THAT'S THE ONE THAT'LL BE
THE KEY TO THE WIN.

284
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:15,000
SO IF FUJIWARA CAN JUST
KEEP HIS ACT TOGETHER

285
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:16,583
FOR A LITTLE WHILE LONGER,

286
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:19,458
HE'LL GIVE HIMSELF THE LONG RACE
HE NEEDS TO SNAG THE VICTORY.

287
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:23,583
WHEN YOU'VE BEEN IN
AS MANY BATTLES AS I HAVE,

288
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:27,416
YOU START TO DEVELOP A SIXTH
SENSE FOR THESE KINDS OF THINGS.

289
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,083
NO MATTER HOW VICIOUS THE BATTLE
LOOKS TO THE REST OF US,

290
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:33,208
ALL THOSE TWO ARE DOIN' ARE
TRADING A COUPLE OF LIGHT JABS.

291
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,166
- ( all exclaiming )

292
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:50,583
- HOLY!
- DAMN!

293
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:53,708
- THIS IS FREAKIN' INCREDIBLE,
I NEVER THOUGHT I'D SEE JOSHIMA

294
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:55,833
RACING AGAINST
PROJECT D'S EIGHT-SIX.

295
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:57,541
- HAVE YOU EVER SEEN
SOMETHIN' SLIDE THAT FAST

296
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:59,083
AROUND A CURVE BEFORE?

297
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:01,208
MAN, SEEING THESE TWO MAMMOTHS
TRY TO KNOCK EACH OTHER DOWN

298
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:02,625
IS KILLER.

299
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:07,250
- FIRST RUN'S ALMOST
OVER. DAMN IT, THAT PRESSURE,

300
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:10,583
IT'S BEEN BREAKING ME DOWN THIS
WHOLE TIME AND I CAN'T SHAKE IT.

301
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:17,208
- PERFECT, I GOT TO WATCH YOUR
EVERY MOVE ON THIS FIRST RUN.

302
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:23,541
- ( tires screeching )

303
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:24,666
- THEY'RE HERE.

304
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:30,375
DUDE, CHECK IT OUT.

305
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:33,000
THEY'RE PRACTICALLY ON TOP
OF EACH OTHER.

306
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:44,416
- ON MY COUNT!

307
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:50,375
FIVE! FOUR! THREE!
TWO! ONE! GO!

308
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:00,791
- ( tires screeching )

309
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:03,208
- I GUESS THAT MUST BE
THE START OF THE SECOND RUN.

310
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:04,333
- SOUNDS LIKE IT.

311
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:11,083
- THIS SECOND ROUND'S GONNA BE
THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE.

312
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:13,375
BUT ISN'T TAKUMI
GONNA BE CHASING?

313
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:15,083
MAYBE THAT'S A GOOD THING.

314
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:17,375
BETTER THAN ANYONE
WHEN HE'S BEHIND.

315
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:20,250
HE GETS SO PERSISTENT
WHEN HE THINKS HE'S GONNA LOSE.

316
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:23,875
THAT GUY'S NEVER LET ANYBODY
HE'S CHASING GET AWAY FROM HIM.

317
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:25,958
I CAN'T BELIEVE THERE ARE
ACTUALLY PEOPLE WHO DON'T THINK

318
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:28,083
TAKUMI'S GONNA BE
ABLE TO KEEP UP?

319
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:30,041
WHATEVER, MAN.

320
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:32,916
OR IS THIS GUY HE'S RACING
ACTUALLY THAT GOOD?

321
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:57,416
- THE S-TWO THOUSAND IS
A CRAZY HARD VEHICLE TO MASTER

322
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:01,208
BUT ITS SPECS ARE ALL HIGH END.
I MEAN FREAKIN' PERFECT.

323
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:03,041
AND I REMEMBER THE CHIEF
TELLING ME ONE TIME

324
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:06,125
THAT WHEN IT CORNERS,
IT'S EVEN FASTER THAN THE NSX.

325
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:08,166
SO IF YOU PUT A SEASONED
DRIVER LIKE JOSHIMA

326
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,458
BEHIND THE WHEEL
OF THAT BAD BOY,

327
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:12,083
THERE'S NO REASON ON
PLANET EARTH

328
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:14,083
IT SHOULD EVER LOSE
TO AN EIGHT-SIX.

329
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:15,708
- DO YOU REALLY THINK SO?

330
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:17,166
- WITHOUT DOING
ANYTHING SPECIAL,

331
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:19,375
JUST BY DRIVING AS NORMALLY
AS HE WOULD ANY OTHER DAY,

332
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,041
HOSHINO WILL FLY AROUND
THIS COURSE

333
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:23,083
FASTER THAN THE EIGHT-SIX
CAN KEEP UP WITH.

334
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:24,416
IT WOULDN'T EVEN
MATTER IF THE EIGHT-SIX

335
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,083
HAD SOME BADASS TURBO
UNDER THE HOOD.

336
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:27,541
THIS'LL BE A BLOOD BATH.

337
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,583
I MEAN I'M NO EXPERT,
BUT THAT'S WHAT I'M THINKING

338
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:31,708
WHAT THE SECOND RUN
WILL LOOK LIKE.

339
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:33,791
BUT STILL, WHAT'S NORMAL
IN THIS SITUATION

340
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:36,791
ISN'T EXACTLY WHAT'S NORMAL
IN ANY CONVENTIONAL SENSE.

341
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:40,791
NO, WITH TWO CRAZY DRIVERS LIKE
THESE WHO KNOWS WHAT TO EXPECT.

342
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:44,500
- YEAH, ESPECIALLY THE DRIVER OF
THE EIGHT-SIX, HE'S A WEIRD ONE.

343
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:46,791
HE'S GOT THIS RAW,
NATURAL TALENT,

344
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:49,541
BUT ONLY THOSE WHO DRIVE
AGAINST HIM CAN FEEL IT.

345
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:51,833
MORE THAN ANYTHING,
FUJIWARA FITS THAT EIGHT-SIX

346
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:53,708
LIKE A GLOVE, ALWAYS HAS.

347
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:56,583
IT'S LIKE HE WAS BORN TO DRIVE
IT OR IT WAS BUILT FOR HIM,

348
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:58,958
BUT EITHER WAY
THEY'RE PERFECTION.

349
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:09,750
- IT MIGHT BE AN NA,
THE F-TWENTY TYPE ENGINE

350
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:13,833
CRANKS OUT A HUNDRED AND
25 HORSE POWER PER LITER.

351
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:16,625
IT'S GOT THE VTEC UNIT. WHICH
PUTS EVEN THE LATEST MODEL

352
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:18,875
TO SHAME AND MAKES THE EIGHT-SIX
LOOK LIKE A WASTE OF METAL.

353
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:21,541
THAT'S EASILY THE BIGGEST THREAT
TO FUJIWARA.

354
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:23,416
BUT THE TRUE VALUE OF
THE S-TWO THOUSAND

355
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,541
LIES IN ITS UNIQUE
HANDLING ABILITY.

356
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,083
YOU SEE, THE ENGINE
THAT'S MOUNTED

357
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:29,416
IN THE FRONT-MID POSITION

358
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:33,125
REALIZES THE IDEAL
FIFTY-FIFTY WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION.

359
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:36,375
THE CAR ALSO HAS A X-BONE FRAME
WITH HIGH BODY INTEGRITY.

360
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:38,333
AFTER A FEW MINUTES
BEHIND THE WHEEL,

361
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:40,666
YOU'LL FORGET
YOU'RE DRIVING A ROADSTER.

362
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:43,250
PLUS, SHE SITS ON TOP OF A
LIGHTWEIGHT AND COMPACT

363
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:46,166
IN-WHEEL DOUBLE WISHBONE
SUSPENSION SYSTEM.

364
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,833
HER POTENTIAL WAS INSTALLED
USING ORTHODOX METHODS,

365
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:50,375
NOT WITH ELECTRONIC GADGETS.

366
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:52,541
THEY DIDN'T USE ANY OF
THE MODERN TECHNOLOGICAL METHODS

367
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:54,500
USED SO OFTEN IN
AUTO CONSTRUCTION TODAY.

368
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:56,541
THIS IS A CLASSIC PIECE
OF MACHINERY.

369
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:58,541
ALL THE TURBOS AND FOUR-WHEEL
DRIVES IN THE WORLD

370
00:20:58,625 --> 00:20:59,708
MEAN NOTHING TO HER.

371
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:02,416
OUT ON THAT COURSE,
SHE OWNS EVERYTHING.

372
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,333
BUT WHAT ALMOST EVERYONE
AGREES ON IS THAT IN THE END

373
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:08,000
THE CAR SELECTS IT'S DRIVER.

374
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:10,916
- WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT IT
TAKES AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT

375
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,375
OF SKILL TO EVEN COME CLOSE TO
MASTERING A VEHICLE LIKE THAT.

376
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:17,500
- KNOWING THAT CAR'S LIMITS
WOULD BE A GOD SEND.

377
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:20,000
ONLY A SELECT HANDFUL OF THE
MOST SKILLED AND TALENTED

378
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:21,541
DRIVERS IN THE WORLD

379
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:23,541
WILL EVER HAVE THE PRIVILEGE
OF UNDERSTANDING THAT VEHICLE.

380
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:26,125
- AND JOSHIMA 'GOD ARM' TOSHI
IS WITHOUT A DOUBT

381
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:28,375
ONE OF THOSE DRIVERS.

382
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:30,916
FUJIWARA IS OUT THERE BURNING
TRACK WITH AN ABSOLUTE BEAST

383
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,291
OF AN OPPONENT.

384
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,250
- ( engines revving )

385
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:04,541
- THIS SECOND RUN'S REALLY TURN
INTO SOMETHING INTRIGUING.

386
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:06,375
I KNOW JOSHIMA PRETTY WELL.

387
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:08,375
AND I GOT A GOOD IDEA WHAT
KINDA SCHEME HE'S COOKED UP

388
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:09,250
FOR THIS KID.

389
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:10,833
- SO YOUR SAYING IT'S A SCHEME.

390
00:22:10,916 --> 00:22:13,458
- BUT IF JOSHIMA'S IN FRONT ALL
HE HAS TO DO IS OUTRUN THE GUY.

391
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:16,416
WHY DOESN'T HE JUST STICK TO
DOING THAT AND END IT NOW?

392
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,250
- YOU DON'T GET IT. TRUST ME,
THE GUY'S A LOT MORE SCREWED UP

393
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:21,166
THAN YOU REALIZE.

394
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:23,250
HE'S USUALLY ALL CALM
AND COLLECTED,

395
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:25,250
BUT PUT HIM UP AN OPPONENT
WITH A LITTLE SKILL

396
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:28,541
AND HE SLIPS INTO
SOME BAD HABITS.

397
00:22:28,625 --> 00:22:31,291
IF HE JUST WANTED TO SAY
"SCREW IT ALL" AND GO FOR BROKE

398
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:32,666
ON HIS HOME COURSE,

399
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,958
HE COULD EASILY OUTDISTANCE
ANY OPPONENT IN NO TIME.

400
00:22:35,041 --> 00:22:36,500
HE KNOWS EVERY INCH
OF THIS COURSE

401
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:38,125
LIKE THE BACK OF HIS HAND.

402
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:41,250
THERE'S NOT A PRO WHO COULD COME
UP TO OUR TURF AND BEAT US.

403
00:22:50,708 --> 00:22:52,500
- ( exhales )
- THIS IS KILLIN' ME.

404
00:22:52,583 --> 00:22:54,625
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING LEFT
TO GIVE!

405
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:02,500
- I ONLY SAY THIS FOR THE SAKE
OF JOSHIMA'S REPUTATION,

406
00:23:02,583 --> 00:23:04,416
BUT IF THE WINNER
ISN'T DECIDED BY THE END

407
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,500
OF THE SECOND RUN
OF THIS BATTLE,

408
00:23:06,583 --> 00:23:09,125
THEN I THINK HE MIGHT BE TRYING
TO ENGINEER THIS WHOLE NIGHT

409
00:23:09,208 --> 00:23:10,875
SO THAT HE WINS WHILE CHASING.

410
00:23:10,958 --> 00:23:12,500
THAT'S KINDA THE WAY
HE IS SOMETIMES.

411
00:23:12,583 --> 00:23:14,375
- NO WAY.
- WHAT? I'D THOUGHT A DOCTOR

412
00:23:14,458 --> 00:23:16,958
KNOW BETTER THAN TO TRY
SOMETHING AS DUMB AS THAT?

413
00:23:17,041 --> 00:23:19,333
PASSING THE EIGHT-SIX ON A
COURSE WITH NO STRAIGHTAWAYS,

414
00:23:19,416 --> 00:23:22,541
WHAT THE HELL,
DOES HE HAVE A DEATH WISH?

415
00:23:22,625 --> 00:23:26,750
- MAYBE. BUT THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT HE'S PLANNING ON DOING.

416
00:23:26,833 --> 00:23:29,291
I'M TELLING YOU,
HE'S GOT ISSUES.

417
00:23:40,166 --> 00:23:41,750
- ♪ AND NOW I MEAN IT ♪

418
00:23:41,833 --> 00:23:43,333
♪ THAT'S HOW I FEEL ♪

419
00:23:43,416 --> 00:23:47,541
♪ I WANNA GET IT RIGHT
WITH YOU ♪

420
00:23:47,625 --> 00:23:50,500
- I DIDN'T NOTICE THIS
WHEN I WAS LEADING EARLIER,

421
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:53,166
BUT HE'S RUNNING
DIFFERENT LINES.

422
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:54,666
♪ AND NOW I'M WAITING ♪

423
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:56,250
♪ FOR YOU TO CALL ♪

424
00:23:56,333 --> 00:23:58,541
♪ THIS LOVE IS RUNNING
FAST ONCE MORE ♪

425
00:23:58,625 --> 00:24:01,083
- I THOUGHT I ALREADY FOUND
THE BEST LINE TO FOLLOW

426
00:24:01,166 --> 00:24:03,500
AND HE'S NOT
EVEN ANYWHERE CLOSE.

427
00:24:03,583 --> 00:24:05,666
THE TIMING HE'S USES FOR
STICKING TO THE INSIDE

428
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:07,708
IS ALWAYS EARLIER OR LATER
THAN I WOULD'VE USED.

429
00:24:07,791 --> 00:24:10,000
IT'S THE OPPOSITE OF EVERYTHING
I'VE BEEN TAUGHT.

430
00:24:10,083 --> 00:24:12,500
BUT IS THAT THE RIGHT THING
TO DO ON THIS COURSE?

431
00:24:12,583 --> 00:24:14,583
IF IT'S NOT THEN,
HOW IN THE HELL

432
00:24:14,666 --> 00:24:16,333
IS HE GETTING THAT
KIND OF SPEED?

433
00:24:16,416 --> 00:24:18,791
- ♪ AND I'M SCREAMING FOR MORE ♪

434
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:20,375
- ♪ STOP TO GIVE UP ♪

435
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,958
♪ I'VE GOT THAT FEELING ♪

436
00:24:29,041 --> 00:24:31,375
- YOU KNOW, RYOSUKE,
I KEEP THINKING ABOUT

437
00:24:31,458 --> 00:24:34,416
WHAT YOU TOLD TAKUMI BEFORE HE
STARTED TONIGHT.

438
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:36,791
- I'LL BE ABLE
TO SAY MORE LATER

439
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:38,750
BUT FOR NOW I WANT YOU TO
JUST CONCENTRATE ON THE ROAD

440
00:24:38,833 --> 00:24:40,500
AND NOT YOUR OPPONENT.

441
00:24:40,583 --> 00:24:43,083
YOUR NOT RACING A MAN,
YOUR RACING A GHOST.

442
00:24:44,625 --> 00:24:47,000
- TAKUMI'S GREATEST WEAPON
MIGHT BE HIS ABILITY

443
00:24:47,083 --> 00:24:48,958
TO ABSORB THE SKILLS
OF HIS OPPONENTS

444
00:24:49,041 --> 00:24:50,333
AS HE'S FOLLOWING THEM,

445
00:24:50,416 --> 00:24:53,666
BUT WHAT YOU SAID TO HIM
DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

446
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:57,250
WHAT DID YOU MEAN WHEN YOU
CALLED JOSHIMA A GHOST?

447
00:25:03,583 --> 00:25:05,958
- ♪ I'VE GOT THAT FEELING ♪

448
00:25:09,625 --> 00:25:11,416
- I DON'T GET ANY OF THIS?

449
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:14,916
HOW CAN HE STAY ON THOSE SCREWED
UP LINES AND STILL BE SO FAST?

450
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:19,500
- ♪ I'VE GOT THAT FEELING ♪

451
00:25:27,166 --> 00:25:29,416
- ( theme song playing )

452
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,250
