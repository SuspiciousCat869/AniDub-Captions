1
00:00:14,416 --> 00:00:15,708
- ( theme music plays )

2
00:00:27,666 --> 00:00:29,083
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,541
- ( engine whirs )

4
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:50,416
- ( cars zoom )

5
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:56,833
- ( tires screech )

6
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:27,791
- ( phone rings )

7
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:30,625
- ( beeps )

8
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:33,708
- Atsuro: WHAT?
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

9
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:34,791
ALL RIGHT, FINE.

10
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:37,000
BUT WHERE ARE YOU
WATCHING IT FROM?

11
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:40,375
YOU'RE AT
THE C-21 HAIRPIN TURN?

12
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:41,666
- ( all gasp )
- NO WAY!

13
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,250
HOW'D THEY ALREADY
MAKE IT THAT FAR? 

14
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:46,083
- ( phone beeps )
- I REALLY HAVE NO IDEA.

15
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,375
BUT THEY'RE RACING
TAIL TO NOSE.

16
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:50,125
I DON'T SEE HOW
THE 8-6 IS KEEPING UP.

17
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:52,208
TOHRU SHOULD HAVE
DITCHED THE GUY BY NOW.

18
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:55,083
- I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS IS
ACTUALLY HAPPENING ON OUR TURF.

19
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:57,750
I DIDN'T THINK THAT ANY DRIVER
COULD KEEP UP WITH TOHRU,

20
00:02:57,833 --> 00:02:59,416
ESPECIALLY NOT THIS LONG.

21
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:03,375
- I DON'T WANT TO
BUY INTO IT EITHER, SHINICHI.

22
00:03:03,458 --> 00:03:07,458
TO EVEN THINK THAT THE 8-6
CAN RUN THIS FAST,

23
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:09,375
IT MAKES ME FEEL SICK
TO MY GUT.

24
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:11,791
TOHRU HATES TO LOSE A RACE
MORE THAN ANYTHING.

25
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:13,625
SO WE ALL KNOW
THAT HE'LL UP HIS PACE.

26
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:16,166
THIS BATTLE'S DANGEROUS,
BUT IT'S ABOUT TO GET WORSE.

27
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,041
- ( gasps )

28
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:21,625
- ONE OF THESE GUYS
COULD END UP CRASHING.

29
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:23,583
- ( engines whir )

30
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:42,750
- COME ON, THE GUY'S 
A DOWNHILL SPECIALIST

31
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:44,583
WHO DRIVES AN
UNDERPOWERED FR.

32
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:47,791
HE'S GOT MORE IN COMMON
WITH TAKUMI THAN YOU THINK.

33
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:50,958
- PLUS, THEIR PRIMARY SKILL
IS HIGH-SPEED CORNERING,

34
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:54,666
WHICH IS INSTINCTUAL WHEN
FEELING THE SPEED OF THE CAR.

35
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,500
- ( engine whirs )

36
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,458
- THE WAY I SEE IT,

37
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:05,916
IF THEY'RE BOTH
DOING THE SAME THING,

38
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,416
ONE OF THEM CAN
GET THE EDGE OVER THE OTHER

39
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,625
BY HAVING A MORE
REFINED TECHNIQUE.

40
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:12,166
- YOU MEAN, THE FACT THAT
TAKUMI'S GONNA BE CHASING

41
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,916
FOR THE FIRST RUN MAKES
SOME KIND OF DIFFERENCE?

42
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,500
- THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I MEAN.

43
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:18,166
THAT WILL DETERMINE
THE WINNER.

44
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,500
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
I DON'T GET IT.

45
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:23,166
- DRIVING BEHIND HIS OPPONENT
THIS ENTIRE TIME,

46
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,083
TAKUMI SHOULD ALREADY
HAVE BEGUN TO UNDERSTAND

47
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:28,083
INSTINCTIVELY MORE THAN
A FEW THINGS ABOUT THIS RACE.

48
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:30,791
- ( engines whir )

49
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:42,250
- I THINK I'M GETTING IT NOW.

50
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:44,083
I CAN TELL BY WATCHING HIM
FROM BEHIND.

51
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:45,291
- ( engine revs )

52
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:50,708
- I CAN SEE THE DIFFERENCES
BETWEEN OUR DRIVING STYLES.

53
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,000
- ( tires screech )

54
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:00,833
- OH, WOW. THEY'RE COMING
AROUND THE CORNER.

55
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:19,708
- MAN, DID YOU SEE THAT?
THOSE GUYS ARE FRICKIN' AMAZING.

56
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:22,000
- THEY WERE LIKE THIS FAR AWAY
FROM CRASHING INTO THE WALL.

57
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,791
- THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.
THOSE DUDES

58
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:29,333
ARE OUT OF THEIR MINDS.

59
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:39,375
- Nao: YOU'VE ALWAYS SPENT
TOO MUCH MONEY

60
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:40,583
ON YOUR STUPID CAR.

61
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:45,833
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT,
I'LL LEND YOU THE MONEY.

62
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:49,375
- ( gasps )
- BUT THERE IS ONE CONDITION.

63
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:51,875
- HUH?  WHAT KIND?

64
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:54,000
- THE KIND THAT SAYS
YOU QUIT RACING ALTOGETHER

65
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:57,375
IF YOU LOSE
THIS NEXT BATTLE.

66
00:05:57,458 --> 00:06:00,500
I'M SERIOUS THIS TIME
SO YOU BETTER HEAR ME.

67
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:03,083
I MEAN IT.

68
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:05,666
- I'M NOT LOSING THIS.

69
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:06,833
- ( gear shifts )

70
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:34,541
- HE CAUGHT UP TO ME.

71
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:35,958
- ( grunts )

72
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:36,958
- HOW COULD HE DO THAT?

73
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:38,958
I'M IN THE ZONE HERE.

74
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:40,958
THIS IS ME
DRIVING AT MY BEST.

75
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:44,500
WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON? 

76
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:03,875
THIS 8-6,

77
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:06,375
WHAT THE HELL IS IT?

78
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:11,541
- THEY'RE SAYING
HE STILL CAN'T DITCH THE 8-6.

79
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:13,416
- THIS DOESN'T MAKE
ANY SENSE TO ME AT ALL.

80
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,250
IT'S LIKE IT'S NOT EVEN
TOHRU DRIVING.

81
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:17,458
- ( phone beeps )

82
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:19,458
- LISTEN, HIS YEARS
BEHIND THE WHEEL

83
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:20,833
HAVE HELPED HIM 
DEVELOP A WEAPON

84
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:22,583
THAT NO ONE ELSE 
CAN COMPETE WITH.

85
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:24,958
HE DIVES INTO A CURVE
FASTER THAN ANYONE I'VE SEEN.

86
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:26,958
- YEAH, AND THAT'S WHY
THERE'S NO WAY THIS PUNK

87
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:28,500
COULD KEEP UP
WITH SOMEONE LIKE THAT.

88
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:31,166
- HE KNOWS EVERY
TWIST AND CORNER

89
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,791
THIS COURSE
HAS TO OFFER.

90
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:36,250
THIS OTHER JERK DROVE IT
FOR THE FIRST TIME LAST NIGHT.

91
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:41,000
BUT NOW THAT 8-6 IS
EATING TOHRU'S BUMPER.

92
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:43,666
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

93
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,666
- ( engines whir )

94
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:50,333
- ( gears shift )
- ( engine revs )

95
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:55,250
- THAT'S AN INCREDIBLE ENTRY
INTO THE CURVE.

96
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:57,750
HE KNOWS EVERY DETAIL
OF THIS COURSE.

97
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:02,583
EXCEPT...

98
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:07,166
HE DOESN'T KNOW
THAT MY 8-6 IS FASTER

99
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,541
DURING THE SHORT SPAN OF TIME
AFTER EXITING ONE CORNER

100
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:11,458
AND BEFORE BREAKING
FOR THE NEXT.

101
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:15,541
BUT WHY?  I DON'T THINK
IT'S BECAUSE

102
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:17,500
OF A DIFFERENCE
IN THE POWER OF OUR CARS.

103
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,291
- Ryosuke:
IN A MOUNTAIN PASS LIKE THIS,

104
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:26,166
YOU CAN LOSE COUNT OF
THE CORNERS PRETTY EASILY.

105
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,416
OF COURSE, IT'S WORSE
WHEN YOU'RE DRIVING DOWNHILL.

106
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,500
YOU BEGIN TO LOSE
THE ABILITY TO DISTINGUISH

107
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:32,291
BETWEEN THE STRAIGHTAWAYS
AND THE CORNERS

108
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:34,000
ON ANY OF
THE UPCOMING STRETCHES.

109
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:35,416
- YEAH, THAT'S TRUE.

110
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,000
THERE ARE A LOT OF SPOTS
WHERE YOU DON'T KNOW

111
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,333
IF YOU SHOULD
LET UP ON THE GAS

112
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:40,000
OR JUST DIVE IN
WITH ALL SHE'S GOT.

113
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:42,708
- AND KNOWING WHERE YOU 
CAN AND CAN'T GO ALL OUT

114
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:44,083
WILL MAKE
THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE

115
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:46,083
BETWEEN TAKUMI
AND HIS OPPONENT.

116
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:48,583
YOU SHOULD REMEMBER THAT,
KEISUKE.

117
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:50,791
THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST
IMPORTANT POINTS

118
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:52,958
IN MY THEORY FOR
BEING THE FASTEST ON THE ROAD.

119
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:54,916
I WANT THIS TO SINK IN,
YOU GOT IT?

120
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
- YEAH.

121
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:58,458
- ( engines whir )

122
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:02,916
- ( tires screech )

123
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:05,458
- NO.

124
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:07,416
I AM NOT GOING
TO LOSE THIS. 

125
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,916
- ( engines whir )
- AH, AH, AH!

126
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,625
- ( screeching )

127
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:23,541
- THAT'S THE MOST RECKLESS
DRIVING I'VE EVER SEEN.

128
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:24,875
- YEAH, MAYBE,
BUT I DON'T THINK

129
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:26,708
I'VE EVER SEEN
TIGHTER CORNERING.

130
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:28,166
- SOMEONE WANT TO EXPLAIN
WHAT THE DEAL IS

131
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,041
WITH THAT
CHEESY AS HELL 8-6?

132
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:32,333
HOW COULD IT KEEP UP WITH
A SEVEN STAR LEAF'S ROADSTER?

133
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:34,625
- ALL I KNOW IS THAT
IT'S NOT FROM AROUND HERE.

134
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,333
THIS COULD BE A REALLY
BAD NIGHT, MAN.

135
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,500
- IT'S ABOUT THAT TIME, BOYS.

136
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:50,916
THEY'RE GETTING UP
ON THE STRETCH OF ROAD

137
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,666
WHERE THE BATTLE
GETS DECIDED.

138
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,958
- RIGHT, BUT COME ON, RYOSUKE.

139
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:57,875
ENOUGH OF THE SUPER-SECRET
SPY-MISSION STUFF ALREADY.

140
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:00,541
TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHAT'S TAKUMI'S PLAN HERE?

141
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:04,291
HOW ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO MAKE IT
OVER A GUTTER WITH NO LID?

142
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,208
- HE STILL CAN'T SHAKE
THE 8-6 OFF HIS TAIL. 

143
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:12,166
AND THEY SHOULD BE BREAKING
THROUGH THE C-10 CURVE

144
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,250
RIGHT ABOUT NOW.

145
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:14,583
- THEY ALREADY GOT AS
FAR AS THE C-10?

146
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:17,208
- THEY'RE BETTER THAN
WE THOUGHT THEY'D BE.

147
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:18,583
I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE GIVEN
THEM MORE CREDIT

148
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:20,916
FROM THE BEGINNING.

149
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,708
- BUT THIS BATTLE
ISN'T OVER YET.

150
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:25,000
I MEAN, JUST 'CAUSE TOHRU
CAN'T SHAKE THE 8-6

151
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,375
DOESN'T MEAN HE'S GONNA LOSE
THE WHOLE THING.

152
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:29,916
IT JUST MEANS
THEY CHANGE PLACES

153
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,583
WHEN THEY GO
INTO THE SECOND RUN.

154
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:34,083
ANYWAY, THIS BATTLE IS JUST
GETTING OFF THE GROUND.

155
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,458
NO WAY HE'LL PASS TOHRU.
THIS IS OUR TURF.

156
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:39,625
IT'LL NEVER HAPPEN.
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

157
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:41,708
AND NOBODY NEW TO THIS COURSE
COULD PASS.

158
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,333
IT'S TOO MUCH FOR THEM.

159
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:45,208
THEY'RE ALMOST TO THE POINT
WHERE THEY CAN'T

160
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:47,041
PUSH THOSE CARS
MUCH HARDER, ANYWAY.

161
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:48,125
- EXACTLY.

162
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:51,208
- IT DOESN'T MATTER

163
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:52,583
IF YOU CAN'T SHAKE HIM OFF,
TOHRU.

164
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:54,000
JUST DON'T RUSH THINGS.

165
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:55,166
STICK WITH A DRIVING STYLE

166
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,541
THAT'LL KEEP YOU FROM LOSING.

167
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:57,500
THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS.

168
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:13,916
- I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT I TOLD FUJIWARA.

169
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,416
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY
TO GET OVER THOSE GUTTERS

170
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,625
AND IT'S GONNA REQUIRE A HELL
OF A LOT OF CONCENTRATION

171
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:20,458
TO MAKE IT WORK.
- YEAH.

172
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:22,708
- SO YOU REMEMBER THAT
BRAND-NEW TECHNIQUE

173
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:24,500
HE'S BEEN WORKING ON LATELY,
DON'T YOU?

174
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,375
- WHERE HE HOOKS HIS 
TIRE INTO THE GUTTER.

175
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:28,250
I THINK HE'S BEEN CALLING
IT THE "GUTTER RUN."

176
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:29,541
- THAT'S RIGHT.

177
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:31,458
- SO IT'S JUST AN
ADAPTATION OF THAT?

178
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:34,208
- OH, NO, EVEN YOU
SHOULD BE ABLE TO SEE

179
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:35,708
THAT THIS ISN'T
THE SORT OF COURSE

180
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:38,291
WHERE THAT KIND OF THING
WOULD BE POSSIBLE.

181
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:40,708
HE'S GOING WITH A TECHNIQUE
THAT'S THE OPPOSITE

182
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:41,750
OF THE GUTTER RUN.

183
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:44,083
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

184
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:46,208
- ( engines whir )

185
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,625
- HE'S AN INCREDIBLE DRIVER.

186
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:52,208
I CAN'T GET HIM
OUT OF MY REARVIEW.

187
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:57,958
I WISH I COULD SEE THIS
GUY'S DRIVING FROM BEHIND.

188
00:11:58,041 --> 00:11:59,875
FROM HERE, I CAN'T EVEN TELL
WHAT KIND OF STYLE IT IS

189
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:01,833
OR IF THE PUNK
IS JUST WINGING IT.

190
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:07,625
WHAT IS IT HE'S DOING
THAT I'M NOT OUT HERE?

191
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:09,500
THIS IS KILLING ME!

192
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:17,083
WHATEVER IT IS, I'LL NEED THAT
SECOND RUN TO FIGURE IT OUT.

193
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,458
I HAVE TO SEE THAT
GUY'S TECHNIQUE!

194
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:40,833
- HE'S CUTTING IN TOO EARLY.

195
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:56,666
THAT'S IT!
THERE'S THE LINE TO TAKE!

196
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,083
- ( engines rev )

197
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:04,875
- ( gasps )

198
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:09,625
- ( tires screech )

199
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:11,666
- DUMBASS!  OPEN YOUR EYES!

200
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,791
YOU'RE ABOUT TO DRIVE STRAIGHT
OVER A LIDLESS GUTTER.

201
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:20,333
HE JUST DASHED IN
FROM THE OUTSIDE 

202
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:21,833
AND NOW HE'S PLANNING
ON TAKING THE INSIDE

203
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:23,750
ON THE NEXT CORNER?
NO WAY, PAL!

204
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:26,083
I'M NOT GIVING YOU THE INSIDE
THAT EASILY.

205
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:28,541
- ( engines whir )

206
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:30,916
- ALL I HAVE TO DO IS GET
HALF OF A CAR LENGTH AHEAD

207
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,791
AND I'LL HAVE CONTROL
OF THE INSIDE.

208
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:34,583
YOU'RE NOT GETTING
THE SPACE FOR IT! 

209
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:40,541
I GOT TO UPHOLD THE PRIDE
OF MY HOME TURF.

210
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:42,166
YOU'RE NOT GONNA PASS!

211
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:46,875
( gasps )

212
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:57,291
WHAT?!

213
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:00,000
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

214
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:02,375
I DIDN'T LEAVE HIM
ANY ROOM TO PASS. 

215
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:05,250
THERE SHOULDN'T BE ANY GROUND
WHERE HE'S DRIVING.

216
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:06,875
DON'T SCREW WITH ME, MAN.

217
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:08,916
HOW ARE YOU DOING THAT?

218
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,541
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DRIVING ON?!

219
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:18,083
- Ryosuke: IT'S AN ADAPTATION
OF A WEIGHT-SHIFTING TECHNIQUE.

220
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:19,875
SO IF YOU'RE HEADING
INTO A CORNER

221
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:22,125
AT A REALLY HIGH RATE OF SPEED,
MOST OF YOUR CAR'S WEIGHT

222
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:24,583
IS GONNA BE SHIFTED
ONTO THE TWO OUTER TIRES.

223
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:26,875
WHEN THAT HAPPENS, YOU OPEN UP
YOUR ACCELERATOR MORE

224
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:30,125
AND SHIFT THE WEIGHT
FURTHER TO THE REAR OF YOUR CAR.

225
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:31,625
- THEN YOU'RE JUST
MOVING THE WEIGHT 

226
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:33,291
THAT'S BEING PLACED
ON YOUR TWO OUTER TIRES

227
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:34,916
TO THE ONE OUTSIDE REAR TIRE?

228
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,958
- THAT'S RIGHT.

229
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:38,583
THE WHOLE POINT OF PERFORMING
A WEIGHT SHIFT

230
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:40,750
IN THE FIRST PLACE IS TO
TAKE AS MUCH WEIGHT AS POSSIBLE

231
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:43,083
OFF THE INSIDE FRONT TIRE
WHILE YOU'RE IN THE TURN.

232
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:45,625
AND IF YOU CAN DO THAT...

233
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:53,500
THEN YOU'VE FOUND A SHORTCUT
RIGHT OVER THAT GUTTER

234
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:56,291
AND AT MAXIMUM SPEED.
- ( gasps )

235
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:01,041
- HE PASSED ME?!

236
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:03,666
I GOT TO BE LOSING MY MIND!

237
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:07,250
WHAT WAS THAT?
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

238
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:09,583
- ( engines whir ) 
- ( tires screech )

239
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:11,750
- DO THAT AGAIN.

240
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:13,166
JUST DO IT ONCE MORE
ON THE NEXT CORNER. 

241
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,708
PLEASE DO IT ONE MORE TIME.

242
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:18,041
I HAVE TO SEE THAT
WITH MY OWN TWO EYES.

243
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:29,458
HUH?
THIS IS CRAP.

244
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:31,875
IF THAT 8-6 CAN DO IT,
THEN I CAN DO IT TOO. 

245
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,208
I GOT NO FEEDBACK FROM
MY RIGHT FRONT TIRE.

246
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:43,625
AM I FLOATING?

247
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:48,458
OH, NO.

248
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:51,958
- ( metal scratches )

249
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:53,750
- ( hisses )

250
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:55,250
DAMN IT!
I CAN'T GET BACK UP.

251
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:04,208
- ( banging )

252
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:05,208
- ( gasps )

253
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:12,875
- ( silent )

254
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:19,666
- ( silent )

255
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,375
- ( tires screech )

256
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,125
- ( pants )

257
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:47,958
- ( gasps )

258
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:51,583
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

259
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:54,083
- HUH?

260
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:55,708
- ARE YOU HURT?

261
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:15,750
- A CRASH AT C-7?
- TOHRU CRASHED? 

262
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:17,208
- Atsuro: IS HE HURT?

263
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,958
OKAY.

264
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:23,583
( sighs )
- ( phone beeps )

265
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:37,583
- THE ROADSTER WAS PASSED
BY THE 8-6

266
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:40,000
AND THEN IT CRASHED
IN THE GUTTER.

267
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:42,041
YOU WIN.

268
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:46,500
- ATSURO, WHAT IS THIS?

269
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:49,083
WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON?!

270
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:05,291
- I THOUGHT
IT WAS A 3-4 GT-R.

271
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:09,125
I GOT TO SAY, I'M GLAD
IT'S AN FR GT TURBO.

272
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:11,625
HE'S GOT GOOD TASTE.

273
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:15,666
THAT'S RIGHT, TAKE A LONG LOOK
AT AN ACE'S SKILL.

274
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:18,083
TAKUMI.
- HUH? 

275
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:26,708
- I AM ATSURO KAWAI.

276
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:29,041
- I'M KEISUKE TAKAHASHI.

277
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:35,625
- HE'S NOT USING
ANY COERCION TACTICS.

278
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:39,375
AND HE'S NOT BEING
OVERCONFIDENT EITHER.

279
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:42,208
THIS IS OUR HOME COURSE
AND HE SHOULDN'T HAVE A CLUE

280
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:44,625
AS TO THE EXTENT
OF MY SKILLS.

281
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:46,583
HOW CAN HE BE SO COMPOSED?

282
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:48,875
- ( silent )

283
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:51,291
- WHY DO I FEEL LIKE THIS?

284
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:54,208
WHAT'S MAKING ME
FEEL SO INTIMIDATED?

285
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:56,750
- ( silent )

286
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:22,125
- ATSURO.

287
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:23,833
- MY WHOLE BODY'S GONE NUMB.

288
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:25,916
IT FEELS LIKE I'VE BEEN
SWALLOWED UP IN THEIR WAKE

289
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,875
BEFORE I'VE EVEN
HIT THE GAS PEDAL.

290
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:30,041
- Tohru: PUT THAT CRAP
OUT OF YOUR HEAD.

291
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:31,625
JUST STICK
TO YOUR OWN PACE.

292
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:33,250
YOU THINK I'M WRONG?
I COULDN'T DO THAT

293
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:35,041
AND LOOK WHAT
HAPPENED TO ME.

294
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:37,250
- Atsuro: YEAH.
- AND YOU SHOULD KNOW

295
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:39,583
IN THE STRETCH OF ROAD
WITH THE LIDLESS GUTTERS--

296
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:41,708
STARTS AT THE C-6 CORNER--

297
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:43,666
JUST MAKE SURE YOU STICK
TO THE INSIDE.

298
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,750
WHATEVER YOU DO,
DON'T LEAVE THAT GUY

299
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:47,333
ANY ROOM AT ALL
TO GET AROUND YOU.

300
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:50,416
- HUH?
- YOU LEAVE ONE METER OPEN

301
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,250
AND HE'S GONNA PASS YOU.

302
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:53,750
THESE GUYS HAVE FIGURED OUT
SOME WAY

303
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:55,125
TO TAKE A SHORTCUT
OVER THE GUTTERS.

304
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:57,541
- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT, TOHRU?

305
00:19:57,625 --> 00:19:58,875
NOBODY KNOWS
HOW TO DO THAT.

306
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:00,916
- THOSE GUYS CAN DO IT,
ALL RIGHT?

307
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,791
NOW BELIEVE ME OR NOT,
I DON'T CARE.

308
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:04,833
JUST DON'T LEAVE
THE INSIDE OPEN.

309
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:08,291
- LET'S GET THIS RACE STARTED.

310
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:13,666
- DON'T LET THEM
GET PAST YOU, ATSURO.

311
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:16,083
IT'S UP TO YOU NOW.

312
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:18,875
- ( engines rev )

313
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:30,708
- Tohru: WE DIDN'T EXPECT THIS.

314
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:31,958
THESE DRIVERS ARE BETTER

315
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:33,958
THAN WE COULD HAVE
EVER IMAGINED.

316
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:36,750
TONIGHT, THEY TAUGHT ME
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN US.

317
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:39,375
WE MIGHT NOT STAND A CHANCE
OF WINNING TONIGHT,

318
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:42,833
BUT AT LEAST HOLD OUT
FOR THE FIRST RUN.

319
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:45,083
- ( engines rev )

320
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:54,791
- Tohru: PROJECT D,
THEY'RE AMAZING.

321
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:56,541
THEY HAVE SOMETHING
ABOUT THEM.

322
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:58,708
I CAN'T EVEN EXPLAIN IT.

323
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:23,166
- ( yawns )

324
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,583
( sighs )

325
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:26,541
- ( yawns )

326
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:34,500
- WELCOME.  OH.

327
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,583
- HEY, KENJI,
WHAT'S GOING ON?

328
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:40,125
- GEEZ, DON'T LOOK
TOO HAPPY TO SEE ME, ITSUKE.

329
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:42,125
- BUY THE HIGH-OCTANE
AND I'LL BE NICE TO YOU.

330
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:44,041
I MEAN, LOOSEN
THE PURSE STRINGS, KENJI.

331
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:45,833
- CALM DOWN.

332
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:47,583
ANYWAY, I JUST HEARD
SOME BIG NEWS.

333
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:49,791
PROJECT D WON
ANOTHER BATTLE, YOU GUYS.

334
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:52,333
- WOW, THAT'S GREAT.
SO WHERE WAS IT THIS TIME?

335
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:54,250
- IN TOCHIGI.
- DID YOU HEAR ANYTHING

336
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:56,041
ABOUT HOW TAKUMI DID?
- HE WON.

337
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:57,291
DUH.
- ( laughs )

338
00:21:57,375 --> 00:21:58,958
- HE SET A NEW
COURSE RECORD TOO.

339
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:01,750
BOTH THE UPHILL AND DOWNHILL
WERE COMPLETE VICTORIES.

340
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:04,833
- YEAH, IT SOUNDS LIKE
OUR LITTLE TAKUMI

341
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:07,250
IS GETTING BETTER ALL THE TIME.
- MM-HMM, MM-HMM, MM-HMM.

342
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:09,333
- AND COMPARED TO HIM...
- HMM?

343
00:22:09,416 --> 00:22:11,250
- YOU WERE GONNA SAY
THAT WE'RE NOT GETTING BETTER

344
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:13,750
ALL THE TIME, RIGHT?
MAN, WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM?

345
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,041
- ( both sigh )

346
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:22,625
- HUH?  SO YOU'RE SERIOUS
ABOUT QUITTING RACING?

347
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:25,583
- I MADE A PROMISE TO YOU
AND I'M GONNA KEEP IT.

348
00:22:25,666 --> 00:22:27,375
I DID LOSE, DIDN'T I?

349
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:32,875
- WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOU OUT THERE?

350
00:22:32,958 --> 00:22:34,208
SERIOUSLY,
DID YOU HIT YOUR HEAD

351
00:22:34,291 --> 00:22:35,750
IN THE CRASH OR
SOMETHING, TOHRU?

352
00:22:35,833 --> 00:22:37,125
YOU GOT TO COME
TO YOUR SENSES.

353
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:39,083
- COME ON, CUT IT OUT,
ALL RIGHT?

354
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:40,708
IT'S NOT FUNNY.
REMEMBER, YOU'RE THE ONE

355
00:22:40,791 --> 00:22:43,291
WHO TOLD ME THAT
I HAD TO QUIT RACING IF I LOST.

356
00:22:43,375 --> 00:22:46,375
- I KNOW I SAID THAT.

357
00:22:46,458 --> 00:22:48,583
BUT TO BE HONEST,
THE ONLY REASON I DID

358
00:22:48,666 --> 00:22:50,291
WAS TO SPITE YOU.
I'M REALLY SORRY.

359
00:22:52,666 --> 00:22:54,125
- OH, FORGET IT.

360
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:58,416
THE LOSS KIND OF REFRESHED ME.
IT SOUNDS WEIRD.

361
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,416
I GOT USED TO THINGS.

362
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:03,333
I STARTED TO FEEL LIKE I COULD
NEVER LOSE ON MY HOME TURF,

363
00:23:03,416 --> 00:23:05,541
LIKE NO MATTER
WHO CHALLENGED ME, I'D WIN.

364
00:23:05,625 --> 00:23:07,916
I'D DRIVEN THAT COURSE
MORE THAN ANYONE.

365
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,125
I HAD THE CONFIDENCE,
BUT I LOST.

366
00:23:10,208 --> 00:23:12,375
AND I LOST TO SOME GUY
WHO CAME FROM A DIFFERENT AREA

367
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:14,375
AND ONLY PRACTICED HERE
FOR ONE NIGHT.

368
00:23:14,458 --> 00:23:17,333
I PROMISE, IT SHOCKED ME
MORE THAN ANYONE.

369
00:23:17,416 --> 00:23:19,333
BUT I GOT TO SAY,
IT'S EXTREMELY LIBERATING

370
00:23:19,416 --> 00:23:20,916
GETTING BEATEN TO A PULP.

371
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,916
- TOHRU.

372
00:23:25,541 --> 00:23:27,500
- HEY, COME ON.
DON'T LOOK LIKE THAT.

373
00:23:27,583 --> 00:23:29,750
IT'S NOT LIKE I'M NEVER
GONNA GET INTO A CAR AGAIN

374
00:23:29,833 --> 00:23:31,083
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

375
00:23:31,166 --> 00:23:32,666
PUSHING YOUR LIMITS
BEHIND THE WHEEL

376
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:34,625
ISN'T EVERYTHING THERE IS
TO BEING A RACER.

377
00:23:34,708 --> 00:23:36,958
I'LL KEEP DOING SOMETHING
WITH CARS. I REALLY WILL.

378
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:38,666
I'LL JUST DO IT
IN A DIFFERENT WAY.

379
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,833
- OKAY.

380
00:23:39,916 --> 00:23:42,750
- IT WAS REALLY A PERFECT NIGHT.

381
00:23:42,833 --> 00:23:45,625
I'VE JUST NEVER FELT SO MUCH
EXCITEMENT BEFORE.

382
00:23:45,708 --> 00:23:48,166
I CAN'T TELL YOU
HOW GLAD I AM

383
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:50,166
THAT I GOT THE CHANCE
TO MEET ALL OF THOSE GUYS.

384
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:52,250
- ( engine revs )

385
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:54,208
- ( tires screech )

386
00:23:54,291 --> 00:23:57,375
- IT'S THE SAME WHEREVER
YOU GO IN THE WORLD, I GUESS.

387
00:23:57,458 --> 00:23:59,750
IN ANY SOCIETY,
ONLY A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE

388
00:23:59,833 --> 00:24:01,125
WILL EVER GET TO 
STAND AT THE TOP.

389
00:24:01,208 --> 00:24:03,083
- I THINK THAT MAYBE--

390
00:24:03,166 --> 00:24:05,958
MAYBE THOSE GUYS LAST NIGHT
ARE STANDING RIGHT ON TOP. 

391
00:24:06,041 --> 00:24:08,291
BUT I LEARNED THAT NO MATTER
WHAT I THOUGHT OF MYSELF,

392
00:24:08,375 --> 00:24:09,708
I'M JUST NOT ONE OF THEM.

393
00:24:09,791 --> 00:24:13,625
PROJECT D,
THOSE GUYS WERE AMAZING.

394
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:21,833
- ( engine whirs )

395
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:25,666
- ( tires screech )

396
00:24:53,041 --> 00:24:54,875
- Father: Project D?

397
00:24:54,958 --> 00:24:56,583
You mean that
team from Goonma

398
00:24:56,666 --> 00:24:58,000
everyone keeps 
going on about?

399
00:24:58,083 --> 00:25:00,541
They're coming out here, huh?

400
00:25:00,625 --> 00:25:03,083
Oh, this should
be interesting.

401
00:25:03,166 --> 00:25:04,666
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING 
THIS WEEKEND, FATHER?

402
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:07,541
YOU DON'T HAVE
A RACE THIS WEEK, DO YOU?

403
00:25:07,625 --> 00:25:11,541
- No, no race, but I'll be busy
with tests the whole time.

404
00:25:11,625 --> 00:25:12,833
Hey, you're not gonna try

405
00:25:12,916 --> 00:25:14,958
and get me to come out
there, are you?

406
00:25:15,041 --> 00:25:16,541
- NO, I WOULDN'T DO THAT.

407
00:25:16,625 --> 00:25:18,583
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO WORRY ABOUT ME.

408
00:25:18,666 --> 00:25:21,375
I GUARANTEE, I WON'T LOSE
AGAINST THESE GUYS.

409
00:25:21,458 --> 00:25:23,875
NOT WITH THE TODOU
SCHOOL NAME ON THE LINE.

410
00:25:27,833 --> 00:25:30,208
- ( theme music plays )
