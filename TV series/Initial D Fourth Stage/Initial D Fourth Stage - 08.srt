1
00:00:14,541 --> 00:00:16,291
- ( theme song playing )

2
00:00:27,125 --> 00:00:28,208
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:00:35,541 --> 00:00:36,833
- ♪ DOG FIGHT ♪

4
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,208

♪ DOG FIGHT ♪

00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:23,583

9
00:01:47,458 --> 00:01:49,041
- SO NOBUHIKO, DID YOU HEAR?

10
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:51,166
- ABOUT PROJECT D COMING UP?

11
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,125
I DID. IT'S PRETTY BIG NEWS.

12
00:01:53,208 --> 00:01:54,625
- I MEAN, WHAT'RE WE GONNA DO?

13
00:01:54,708 --> 00:01:56,375
I'M TOTALLY FREAKING
OUT HERE, MAN.

14
00:01:56,458 --> 00:01:57,791
- I DON'T SEE WHY.

15
00:01:57,875 --> 00:01:59,625
IT ISN'T LIKE THERE'S ANYTHING
FOR US TO BE AFRAID OF.

16
00:01:59,708 --> 00:02:01,416
- ARE YOU SERIOUS,
YOU REALLY DON'T THINK SO?

17
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,708
- NAH, MORE THAN ANYTHING
I'M JUST CURIOUS.

18
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:05,208
I WANNA SEE IF THIS
FAMOUS TEAM

19
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,250
CAN ACTUALLY LIVE UP TO
THEIR REPUTATION.

20
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:08,666
I'M ACTUALLY
EXCITED THEY'RE COMING

21
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:09,958
TO RACE ON OUR HOME COURSE.

22
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:12,625
SHOULD BE AN ADVENTURE.
DON'T YOU THINK, KYOKO?

23
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:14,625
HMM.

24
00:02:18,916 --> 00:02:21,583
- YOU KNOW, IF I HAD TO TAKE A
GUESS, I'D SAY YOU WERE OUT HERE

25
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:24,125
LOOKIN' FOR A SILVER
CELL PHONE. AM I RIGHT?

26
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:27,833
- OKAY, I'M MIGHT BE
GOING CRAZY, BUT

27
00:02:27,916 --> 00:02:30,791
I THINK I'VE JUST MET
MY MR. RIGHT!

28
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:32,166
- ( engine starts )

29
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:35,708
- WAIT, DON'T GO!

30
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,625
- Nobuhiko: KYOKO?
KYOKO, WAKE UP.

31
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,083
- WERE YOU EVEN
LISTENING TO HIM?

32
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:49,708
OUR NEXT OPPONENT IS PROJECT D,
IT'S A PRETTY BIG DEAL.

33
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:52,625
- WHAT I WAS SAYING IS THAT WE
WANT YOU TO TAKE THE HILL CLIMB.

34
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:55,333
THESE DAYS YOU'RE OUR ACE,
YOU DO REALIZE THAT, RIGHT?

35
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:59,083
- YEAH, OF COURSE I DO. I'LL
STAY FOCUSED AND HIT IT HARD.

36
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:01,125
JUST LEAVE THAT
HILL CLIMB TO ME.

37
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:02,708
- DO YOU WANNA KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT THE GUY

38
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:03,958
WHO'S DRIVING AGAINST YOU?

39
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:06,375
- NOT A CHANCE.
THAT STUFF'LL CLOUD MY HEAD.

40
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:08,250
I'LL CONCENTRATE BETTER
WITHOUT OUT IT.

41
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:14,250
THE ONLY THING I CAN
DO IS GET OUT THERE

42
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:16,541
AND DRIVE THE BEST I KNOW HOW.

43
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:28,166
- ( engine revving )

44
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:58,958
- ( tires screeching )

45
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:07,791
- THIS IS BAD.

46
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:11,333
THE BATTLE'S TOMORROW AND I'M
NOT IN MY GROOVE AT ALL.

47
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:14,416
I CAN'T GET EXCITED OVER THIS
ONE LIKE I CAN THE OTHER RACES.

48
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:30,708
- YEAH. COOL. I GOTCHA.

49
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:34,416
IT WAS THE GUY FROM
THE BASE PARKING LOT.

50
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,541
- HE SAYS PROJECT D
IS PULLING IN.

51
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:38,708
- HMM.

52
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:42,666
I GOT A STRANGE FEELING ABOUT
THIS. SOMETHING WITH THE ENGINE.

53
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,083
MAYBE I'M JUST
IMAGINING IT. I DUNNO.

54
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:50,041
ALL NIGHT AND TOMORROW I HAVE
TO MAKE SURE MY FOCUS ON

55
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:52,416
THIS BATTLE AND NOTHING ELSE.

56
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,750
I CAN'T LOSE.
EVEN IF I'M UP AGAINST

57
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:57,125
THE BEST DRIVER
WE'VE EVER SEEN.

58
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:11,208
- I'M GONNA BET THIS IS THEM.

59
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:15,083
- ( engine revs )

60
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:39,458
- ( gasps )

61
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:42,041
- DO YOU SEE THE GUY
IN THE YELLOW FD?

62
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:43,708
THAT'S KEISUKE TAKAHASHI,

63
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:46,541
PROJECT D'S HILL CLIMBER.
ONE BAD DUDE.

64
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:48,250
HE'S THE ONE YOU'RE
RACING TOMORROW.

65
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:52,083
- ( stutters )
KEISUKE TAKAHASHI...

66
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:57,000
- C'MON, YOU'RE NOT
INTIMIDATED, ARE YOU?

67
00:05:57,083 --> 00:06:00,458
THIS GUY DRIVES AN FD
ALMOST EXACTLY LIKE YOURS.

68
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:02,125
YOU HAVE A KILLER
DRIVING TECHNIQUE

69
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:03,541
THAT ANYONE WOULD RECOGNIZE.

70
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:07,083
SHOW HIM YOUR SKILLS, BE
CONFIDENT AND YOU WILL BE FINE.

71
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:08,958
- KEISUKE TAKAHASHI...

72
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:14,708
I CAN'T EVEN THINK STRAIGHT.
IT HAD TO BE LIKE THIS?

73
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,458
JUST MY LUCK.

74
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,916
OF COURSE I HAVE TO FACE
THIS GUY LIKE THIS.

75
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:27,166
- OKAY. IS IT COOL IF WE
START PRACTICE RUNS?

76
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:31,958
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS. LET'S ROLL.

77
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:35,000
I WANT YOU TO DO FIVE RUNS
AT EIGHTY PERCENT.

78
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:37,458
ONE THING. YOU GUYS
WON'T BE ABLE TO DRIVE

79
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:39,166
LIKE YOU USUALLY DO, OKAY?

80
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:42,375
JUST SO YOU KNOW, THIS RUN
WAS CHOSEN SPECIFICALLY

81
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:44,125
TO TRAIN YOU, KEISUKE.

82
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:45,666
SO, HIT IT WITH ALL YOU GOT.

83
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,208
- HUH? WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

84
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:49,750
- OKAY, YOU'RE READY TO GO.

85
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:51,541
- LOOKS LIKE WE'RE GOOD
OVER HERE TOO.

86
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,250
- UH.

87
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:06,500
- THOSE ARE TWO
AMAZING MACHINES.

88
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:08,250
GIVES ME CHILLS JUST
WATCHING THEM.

89
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:10,875
- HOW CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THEM
LIKE THEY'RE HOT CHICKS, MAN?

90
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:13,458
WE'RE GOING HEAD TO HEAD
WITH THOSE CARS TOMORROW NIGHT.

91
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:16,541
- SO, NOBUHIKO, WHAT DO YOU PLAN
ON DOING BETWEEN NOW AND THEN?

92
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:19,041
- I'M GONNA WATCH THEIR
EVERY MOVE UNTIL THE SUN IS UP.

93
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:21,083
I TOOK TOMORROW OFF
FROM WORK.

94
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:24,583
CHANCES LIKE THIS DON'T
COME ALONG VERY OFTEN.

95
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:26,708
I'LL SCRUTINIZE EVERY
MOVE THEY MAKE

96
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:30,958
WHILE THEY TRY TO UNRAVEL
THE INS AND OUTS OF OUR COURSE.

97
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:33,250
ESTABLISHING ANY KIND OF
PLAN WILL HAVE TO WAIT

98
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:35,041
UNTIL AFTER THAT.

99
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:38,041
THE TWO DRIVERS FOR
PROJECT D ARE GREAT, NO DOUBT.

100
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,916
BUT IT'S THAT DUDE IN-CHARGE
WHO'S THE TRULY AMAZING ONE.

101
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:44,583
I HAVE TO FIND THEIR WEAKNESS.

102
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:48,458
- ( tires screeching )

103
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:01,583
- ( tires screeching )

104
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:06,750
- THIS COURSE IS
A PAIN IN MY ASS TO DRIVE.

105
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:15,291
NAH, FUMIHIRO. IT'S TERRIBLE.

106
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:17,833
THE ASPHALT'S WAVIER
THAN A FREAKIN' RIVER.

107
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:19,833
MY CAR'LL BE TOSSING
SPARKS ALL OVER

108
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,833
LIKE ONE OF THOSE
OLD F-ONE JOBS.

109
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:23,291
WE RAISED THE CAR A FEW TIMES,

110
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:24,708
TRIED LIKE SIX
DIFFERENT SETTINGS,

111
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:26,708
BUT NOTHING'S COMING
TOGETHER RIGHT.

112
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:28,916
IT'S ALL STARTING TO
MAKE ME KINDA NERVOUS.

113
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,791
- CHECK OUT TAKUMI'S RIDE.

114
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:32,875
THE OLD EIGHT-SIX
IS HAVING ISSUES TOO.

115
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,500
I GUESS NOBODY'S SAFE.

116
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:39,041
OH, YEAH, ONE OTHER THING.
HAVE YOU NOTICED YET?

117
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:40,750
- NOTICED WHAT?

118
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:42,791
- REMEMBER THAT CHICK IN
THE BLACK FD WE RAN INTO

119
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:45,000
THE OTHER DAY WHEN WE CAME OUT
HERE TO SCOUT THE COURSE.

120
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:46,458
IT LOOKS LIKE SHE'S A
MEMBER OF THE GROUP

121
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:49,000
WE'RE GOING UP AGAINST.

122
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:51,125
- STRANGE. I DIDN'T EVEN
SEE HER WITH 'EM.

123
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:53,333
- YEAH. SHE COULDN'T TAKE
HER EYES OFF OF YOUR FD

124
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:55,333
WHEN YOU DROVE OFF.

125
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:56,875
I'M WONDERING IF
SHE'S THE ONE

126
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:58,416
WHO'S REPRESENTING THEM
IN THE HILL CLIMB.

127
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,833
THAT COULD MAKE
THINGS INTERESTING.

128
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:02,208
- I'D SAY THAT'S A VERY
LIKELY POSSIBILITY.

129
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,458
I MEAN THE GIRL
IS DRIVING AN FD, RIGHT?

130
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:06,000
- WHAT?

131
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:08,541
- ANYWAY, IT DOESN'T MATTER
TO ME WHO I'M DRIVING AGAINST.

132
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:09,875
IT COULD BE ANYONE.

133
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:13,208
TRUTH IS, MY REAL OPPONENT
IS THE COURSE ITSELF.

134
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,208
- Woman: OH MY GOSH!

135
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:21,333
IT'S LIKE FATE ITSELF SET
YOU GUYS UP TO MEET.

136
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:23,375
- THERE'S NOTHING
WONDERFUL ABOUT IT.

137
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:25,458
MORE THAN ANYTHING
I WANNA RUN AWAY.

138
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:26,750
- WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

139
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,875
I MEAN, THIS IS A ONCE IN
A LIFETIME CHANCE.

140
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:30,833
- YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS.

141
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:32,791
- YES, I AM. YOU FOUND
A REALLY HOT GUY

142
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:34,458
WHO'S INTO THE SAME
STUFF AS YOU!

143
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:36,541
IT'S THE PERFECT CHANCE
TO GET TO KNOW HIM.

144
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:37,875
- YEAH, YOU THINK SO?

145
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:39,666
- DO I LOOK LIKE
I'M LYING TO YOU?

146
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,166
YOU'VE GOTTA GET ON THAT
COURSE AND RACE THIS GUY.

147
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,000
IF YOU SHOW HIM WHAT A
GREAT DRIVER YOU ARE,

148
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,041
HE'S FOR SURE GONNA TAKE NOTICE.

149
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:48,958
IT'S A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY.
DON'T PASS IT UP.

150
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,500
- HMM.

151
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:02,375
- I STUCK AROUND UNTIL SUNRISE
WATCHING THEIR TRIAL RUNS,

152
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:03,708
AND I GOTTA TELL YOU,

153
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:06,166
THEY'RE NOT FOOLING AROUND.
THESE GUYS ARE GOOD.

154
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,916
ESPECIALLY THAT EIGHT-SIX.
ON THE DOWNHILL,

155
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,166
THAT SUCKER WAS OPERATING WAY
ABOVE WHAT WE'RE USED TO.

156
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,958
LOOK, THE TRUTH IS THAT WE
DON'T HAVE A DOWNHILLER

157
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:14,666
THAT CAN KNOCK THEM
OFF THE TRACKS,

158
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:15,916
SO, I'LL RACE THAT LEG,

159
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,125
BUT I DON'T WANT YOU TO
EXPECT TOO MUCH.

160
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:20,708
WHEN IT COMES TO THE
HILL CLIMB THOUGH,

161
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:22,750
I THINK OUR TEAM MIGHT BE ABLE
TO KNOCK IT OUT.

162
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:24,666
THANKS IN NO SMALL
PART TO A LITTLE ACE

163
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,791
IN OUR POCKET CALLED KYOKO.

164
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:29,541
WE PLAY OUR CARDS RIGHT
AND WE MIGHT ACTUALLY

165
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:31,208
HAVE A CHANCE AT BEATING THEM.

166
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:33,958
IT MAY NOT BE MUCH OF A PLAN,
BUT IT'S ALL WE'VE GOT.

167
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:35,708
WE'RE ALL COUNTING
ON YOU, KYOKO.

168
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:37,250
- I WON'T LET YOU DOWN.

169
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:40,166
I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER BEEN
MORE MOTIVATED FOR A RACE.

170
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:58,291
- ( air hissing )

171
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,000
- ( gasps )

172
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,625
- ( tires screeching )

173
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:27,708
- DID YOUR RIDE CRAP OUT ON YOU?

174
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:32,041
- UH, YEAH, I WAS DRIVING.
AND THE ENGINE DIED ON ME.

175
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:34,625
- WHAT, JUST OUTTA NOWHERE?

176
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:37,916
- NO. NOT EXACTLY
OUT OF NOWHERE.

177
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,500
IT'S BEEN RUNNING A
LITTLE SHAKY SINCE, LIKE,

178
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:42,958
THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY,
BUT I DUNNO,

179
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:46,041
I GUESS I FIGURED
I WAS IMAGINING IT.

180
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:49,166
THEN JUST A MINUTE AGO ALMOST
ALL THE POWER DROPPED OUT.

181
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,583
I GOT A LITTLE FREAKED OUT
SO I STOPPED.

182
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,250
- HOLD ON.

183
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:56,458
- WEREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO RACE
ME IN THE HILL CLIMB TONIGHT?

184
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:57,958
THAT'S YOU RIGHT?

185
00:11:58,041 --> 00:12:00,125
- THAT'S ME.

186
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:03,875
- BUT WITH MY CAR...
- THIS REALLY SUCKS.

187
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:05,500
WELL, THAT'S TOO BAD.

188
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:08,458
I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO
RACING ANOTHER FD.

189
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:11,458
IT SEEMED FAST. YOU SEEMED LIKE
YOU COULD CARRY THE COURSE.

190
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,000
IF YOU THOUGHT SOMETHING
WAS WRONG WITH YOUR CAR,

191
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:16,375
WHY DIDN'T YOU BOTHER
TO CHECK IT OUT

192
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:18,208
WHEN THERE WAS STILL LIGHT?

193
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:21,416
I'M SORRY TO HEAR YOU'D TRY
TO BEAT ME IN A CAR

194
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,666
THAT ISN'T MAINTAINED.

195
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,791
THAT'S JUST SLOPPY.

196
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:27,083
AND THERE'S NOT ONE EXCITING
THING ABOUT BATTLING A DRIVER

197
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:29,083
WHO DOESN'T GIVE A CRAP
ABOUT THEIR OWN CAR.

198
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,041
- ( tires screeching )

199
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:42,500
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
THAT WAS SO EMBARRASSING.

200
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:53,083
- WHOA, KYOKO'S FD
BROKE DOWN?

201
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:54,500
- YEAH, THAT'S WHAT HE SAID.

202
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:56,583
SHE WAS STARING AT HER ENGINE
ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.

203
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:58,041
- THAT DOESN'T SOUND GOOD.

204
00:12:58,125 --> 00:12:59,500
WHAT DO YOU THINK WE
SHOULD DO ABOUT IT?

205
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:01,250
- FIRST, WE GO TAKE A LOOK.

206
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,541
- I FEEL LIKE SUCH A LOSER.

207
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:08,958
WHY COULDN'T I HAVE JUST
LISTENED TO MY CAR?

208
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:11,416
IT WAS TRYING TO
TELL ME SOMETHING.

209
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,000
I GOT ALL EXCITED LIKE
SOME STUPID LITTLE GIRL,

210
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:17,208
AND THIS IS WHAT I GET. NICE.

211
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:19,708
I WANTED TO RACE SO BAD.

212
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:22,916
AND MORE THAN ANYTHING,
TO GO UP AGAINST KEISUKE.

213
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,666
IT COULD'VE BEEN PERFECTION.

214
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:28,541
BUT NOW, HE JUST HATES ME.

215
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:31,666
- ( car approaching )

216
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:32,750
- HUH?

217
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:40,208
- ( gasps )

218
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:51,083
- HEY, YOU'RE CAR'S STILL
GOT SOME JUICE IN IT, RIGHT?

219
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:53,500
WELL, DON'T JUST STARE AT ME,
PULL IT BACK AROUND.

220
00:13:57,833 --> 00:14:01,416
- CHECK IT. IT'S JUST LIKE
I THOUGHT. PIPING SLIPPED OUT.

221
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,833
THE INTERCOOLER HOSING
MUST HAVE CORRODED.

222
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:05,500
- CAN YOU FIX IT?

223
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:08,708
- ISN'T THAT WHY YOU KEEP ME
AROUND? OF COURSE I CAN FIX IT.

224
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:10,750
WE GOT EVERYTHING WE
NEED RIGHT HERE.

225
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:13,541
- THEN LET'S GET CRACKING.
I WANNA DO THIS FAST.

226
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,250
- YOU THINK THEY'LL BE
ABLE TO FIX IT.

227
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:22,000
- I'D BE SURPRISED
IF THEY COULDN'T.

228
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:23,208
I MEAN, THEY TOOK
EVERY SPARE PART

229
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:24,833
WE BROUGHT WITH US UP THERE.

230
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:27,333
- ( chuckles ) YOU KNOW HOW
THOROUGH KEISUKE CAN BE.

231
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:32,041
- HEY, RYOSUKE.
- HMM?

232
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:34,166
- DIDN'T YOU SAY THAT THE REASON
YOU CHOSE THIS COURSE

233
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,291
IS BECAUSE YOU WANTED
TO TRAIN KEISUKE?

234
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:39,041
YOU WEREN'T KIDDING AROUND,
WERE YOU? YOU DID MEAN IT RIGHT?

235
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:41,666
- COURSE I DID.
KEISUKE ISN'T ONE TO HESITATE

236
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,833
WHEN IT COMES TO STICKING THAT
ACCELERATOR DOWN.

237
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,416
I DON'T HAVE TO TELL
YOU HE'S A FIGHTER.

238
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,333
BUT IT CAN WORK AGAINST
HIM SOMETIMES.

239
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:50,041
IT ISN'T TOO MUCH OF AN ISSUE
WHEN THE COURSE IS SMOOTH.

240
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:52,000
BUT ON A ROAD
LIKE THIS ONE IT IS.

241
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,708
A FIERCE BATTLING SPIRIT AND
COLDER THAN ICE PEDAL WORK

242
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:58,458
IS WHAT I WANT FROM HIM.

243
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:02,375
THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN TRYING TO
BEAT INTO HIS HEAD FOR SO LONG.

244
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:05,500
- SHE'S NOT HERE. THAT'S WEIRD,
WHERE COULD SHE HAVE GONE?

245
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,250
- ( engine revving )

246
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,291
- THE BOOST IS KICKING IN
JUST WHEN IT SHOULD.

247
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:18,708
I DON'T WANNA HEAR ANY
MORE ABOUT YOU

248
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:20,333
NOT GETTING ENOUGH POWER.

249
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:24,250
- HOW COOL. I WISH I KNEW
HOW TO SAY THANK YOU.

250
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:27,208
- FORGET ABOUT IT. I DIDN'T
DO THIS TO HEAR A THANK YOU.

251
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:29,708
I JUST WANT TO SEE YOU GIVE IT
ALL YOU'VE GOT TONIGHT.

252
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:32,000
- ( engine revving )

253
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,583
- LET'S GET BACK, TOMIGUCHI.
- COOL.

254
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:43,500
- OH, DON'T TELL ME.
DID HE JUST FIX HER CAR?

255
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:45,958
- THAT'S GOTTA BE THE COOLEST
THING I'VE EVER SEEN.

256
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:53,958
- I LIKE HIM. I LIKE HIM SO MUCH
MORE THAN I THOUGHT I COULD.

257
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:55,875
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT TO DO ANYMORE.

258
00:15:57,333 --> 00:16:01,166
- YOU WANNA LEAD FIRST?
- HMM.

259
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,500
- BEING AGGRESSIVE IN THIS
RACE WILL WORK FOR YOU.

260
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,083
BUT IF YOU'RE THINKING
ABOUT STRATEGY,

261
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:07,375
SHOULDN'T YOU BE CHASING
FOR THE FIRST HEAT?

262
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:09,416
FROM WHAT I COULD TELL
WATCHING THESE GUYS ROLL,

263
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,250
THAT GUY'S FD ISN'T USED
TO COURSES LIKE THIS ONE.

264
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:16,375
- YEAH, I KNOW WHAT YOU'VE SEEN,
BUT I WANNA DO THIS MY WAY.

265
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:19,041
I JUST... I HAVE
TO DRIVE IN FRONT.

266
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:27,166
I NEVER INTRODUCED MYSELF.
MY NAME'S KYOKO IWASE.

267
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,041
IT'S A PLEASURE
TO FINALLY RACE YOU.

268
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:30,958
- KEISUKE TAKAHASHI,
WITH PROJECT D,

269
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:32,583
IF YOU COULDN'T GUESS.

270
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:40,083
- HOLD UP FOR A SEC. I ONLY
HAVE ONE THING TO TELL YOU.

271
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,916
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BATTLE,
IF SOMETHING STRIKES YOU AS ODD,

272
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,333
REMEMBER THIS.

273
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:46,333
THAT GIRL'S BEHIND A WHEEL
OF A SINGLE TURBINE TURBO.

274
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:49,500
- HUH? WHAT THE HELL
IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

275
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:53,583
- FUMIHIRO, LET'S DO THIS.
- YOU GOT IT.

276
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:55,500

287
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:28,458
I KNOW YOU'VE GOT A
PLAN FOR KYOKO.

288
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:29,958
YOU'VE GOTTA TELL US.

289
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:32,166
- IT DOESN'T REALLY
MATTER ANYMORE.

290
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,250
I'VE KNOWN KYOKO
FOR A LONG TIME.

291
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:36,208
AND SHE LETS HER EMOTIONS
DO THE DRIVING FOR HER

292
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:37,750
WHEN SHE GETS ALL WORKED UP.

293
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:40,125
SHE ALREADY OWES THOSE
GUYS FOR FIXING HER CAR.

294
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:41,916
MY BET IS THAT NOW
SHE'LL DITCH HER TACTICS

295
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
AND JUST TAKE THEM HEAD ON.

296
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:45,333
THAT'S JUST THE WAY SHE IS.

297
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:56,250
- THIS CHICK IS GOOD.

298
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:58,500
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING
ABOUT HER I CAN'T PEG.

299
00:17:58,583 --> 00:17:59,708
IS SHE ONE OF THOSE OPPONENTS

300
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:02,083
THAT'LL GIVE ME A
TOUGH TIME OUT HERE.

301
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:04,708
I DON'T GET IT. MAYBE
I'M JUST OUT OF IT.

302
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:06,166
OR MAYBE WE SCREWED
UP HER SETTINGS

303
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:07,708
WHEN WE JACKED WITH HER RIDE.

304
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:14,583
- ( tires screeching )

00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:16,625
- DON'T FALL INTO HER
PACE, KEISUKE.

306
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:18,166
COME ON. KEEP COOL, PAL.

307
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:21,666
YOU GOTTA STAY CALM. I MEAN,
HELL, YOU JUST STARTED THE RACE!

308
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:36,750
- THIS IS SO DIFFERENT.

309
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:38,000
I'VE NEVER FELT THIS KIND
OF FULFILLMENT

310
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,500
WHEN DRIVING ON THE
MOUNTAIN PASS BEFORE.

311
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:43,458
I KNOW I CAN'T BEAT HIM,
NO MATTER WHAT I DO.

312
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:47,166
BUT I DON'T CARE.
I JUST WANT HIM TO WATCH ME.

313
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:54,166
I WANT HIM TO SEE ME
DRIVING MY BEST.

314
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,125
THAT'S WHY I
WANTED TO LEAD.

315
00:18:58,458 --> 00:19:01,750
I HAVE HIS UNDIVIDED ATTENTION,
IF ONLY FOR A MOMENT.

316
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:05,041
FOR NOW, IT'S ALL ON ME.
I LOVE IT!

317
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:10,750
WATCH ME, MY DARLING. THIS IS
ME. THIS IS WHAT I CAN DO.

318
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:13,916
- I'M SURPRISED, GIRL.
YOU'RE A FAST ONE.

319
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,125
I BLEW YOU OFF BEFORE

320
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:16,791
'CUZ I FIGURED YOU WERE
JUST SOME CHICK.

321
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:18,583
BUT THAT WAS MY BAD.

322
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:22,291
RIGHT NOW, ALL I SEE IS ONE
TOP-NOTCH ROTARY DRIVER.

323
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:24,083
BUT NOW THAT I SEE YOU
FOR WHAT YOU ARE,

324
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:27,083
I GOTTA RESET MY FOCUS AND START
THIS WHOLE THING OVER AGAIN.

325
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,791
I WON'T GET DITCHED
BY ANOTHER THIRTEEN B.

326
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:32,500
ALL RIGHT, BABY.
YOU'RE MY THIRTEEN B TURBO.

327
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:34,291
LET'S TEAR THIS ROAD UP!

328
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:41,166
- OKAY, THANKS A LOT.
YOU'LL NEVER BELIEVE THIS.

329
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,625
BUT THEY'RE ACTUALLY PACING
EACH OTHER, FROM WHAT HE SAID.

330
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:45,625
- IT'S BEEN COMMON KNOWLEDGE
FOR A LONG TIME,

331
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:47,125
SINCE THE ENGINE WAS DESIGNED,

332
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:49,958
THAT A SINGLE TURBINE
TURBO IS GOING TO LAG.

333
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:52,458
BUT THE TURBINES THESE DAYS
ARE SO WELL DESIGNED

334
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:53,583
THAT IT STILL SPOOLS

335
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:55,291
EVEN AT A VERY LOW
AMOUNT OF PRESSURE.

336
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:59,791
THAT KIND OF POWER
WORKS WELL IN THIS COURSE,

337
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:02,791
MAKING HER FD
THE EASIER TWO TO DRIVE.

338
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:04,500
THE MOTOR MUST'VE BEEN
TUNED BY SOMEONE

339
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:06,958
WITH A WEALTH OF KNOWLEDGE
ABOUT THIS COURSE.

340
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:11,750
COMPARED TO THAT, KEISUKE'S
CAR IS A TWIN TURBO.

341
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:15,750
IT'S POWER OUTPUT DOESN'T MATCH
THIS COURSE AS WELL AS HERS.

342
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:19,125
THAT'S LIKE A HANDICAP
FOR KEISUKE, WHICH IS WHY,

343
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:21,500
AT LEAST FOR THE MOMENT,
THE RACE IS TIED.

344
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:23,416
- WAIT A MINUTE, IF YOU KNEW
THAT MUCH ALREADY,

345
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,166
COULDN'T WE HAVE ADDRESSED
IT DURING THE EARLY RUNS

346
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,000
AND TWEAKED THE CAR
TO COMPENSATE FOR IT?

347
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:29,125
THAT COULD'VE HELPED HIM.

348
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:31,000
- NO WAY. RELYING ON SETTINGS
TO CONTROL THE POWER

349
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:32,666
OF YOUR VEHICLE SHOWS WEAKNESS.

350
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:36,458
IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH
FOR D'S DRIVERS. PERIOD.

351
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:38,833
KEEP IN MIND WE'RE WORKING
ON ACCELERATION TECHNIQUE

352
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:40,500
IN THIS RACE.

353
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:41,666
WITH A COURSE LIKE THIS ONE,

354
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,291
WHERE THE SURFACE IS IN
TERRIBLE CONDITION

355
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:45,416
GETTING TRACTION IS
HORRIBLY DIFFICULT,

356
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,125
WHICH MAKES THIS THE PERFECT
SETTING FOR OUR PURPOSES.

357
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,833
MAKING THE ASSUMPTION
THAT KEISUKE IS CAPABLE

358
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:56,625
OF CONTROLLING HIS ACCELERATOR
ON FIVE DIFFERENT LEVELS.

359
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:00,416
THIS KIND OF TRAINING
IS WHAT HE NEEDS

360
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,166
TO INCREASE THAT NUMBER TO TEN.

361
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:03,875
- TEN LEVELS?

362
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:06,500
- I'VE PRACTICED PLENTY
OF THINGS LIKE THAT MYSELF.

363
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:13,500
- ON THE STRAIGHAWAYS
SHE OPENS UP THE GAP A BIT.

364
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:15,916
COULD HER CAR BE MORE
POWERFUL THAN MINE?

365
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,750
BUT IF SO, HOW DOES
IT GET MORE STABILITY

366
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:19,958
COMING OUT OF A
CORNER THAN I DO?

367
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:24,250
I DON'T GET IT, I'M STILL
HAVING MORE TROUBLE

368
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:25,708
OPENING UP THE ACCELERATOR.

369
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:28,916
AM I THAT BAD OF A DRIVER?

370
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,750
I DON'T GET ANY OF THIS, BRO.

371
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:32,750
YOU TOLD ME THAT HER CAR'S
A SINGLE TURBINE,

372
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:35,583
BUT SO WHAT? WHAT THE HELL
DOES THAT MATTER?

373
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:38,666
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
A SINGLE AND A TWIN TURBINE?

374
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:41,416
- ( tires screeching )

375
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:48,125
- EVEN WHEN WE GUN IT
AT THE SAME POINT,

376
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:52,000
HER CAR GLIDES ALONG WHILE
MINE SLIDES LIKE IT'S ON ICE.

377
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:56,083
EVERYTHING I TRY JUST PUTS
MORE STRESS ON MY TIRES.

378
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:57,333
SO WHAT DO I DO?

379
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:59,791
DELAY THE TIMING OF OPENING UP
THE ACCELERATOR?

380
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:02,541
NO WAY. I DO THAT,
SHE JUST GETS FARTHER AHEAD.

381
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:05,250
I GOTTA CHANGE THE WAY
I PUT MY FOOT DOWN.

382
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:08,875
I GOTTA BE MORE DELICATE.

383
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:10,083
STEP DOWN LIKE A CENTIMETER,

384
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:12,125
WHEN I'M USUALLY
STEPPING DOWN TWO.

385
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:14,541
WAIT A BREATH, THEN STEP DOWN
ANOTHER CENTIMETER.

386
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:18,750
I'M STILL STEPPING DOWN
TOO HARD! DAMMIT!

387
00:22:18,833 --> 00:22:20,416
THIS IS TOUGHER THAN I THOUGHT!

388
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:23,416
I'VE NEVER TRIED A DELICATE
ACCELERATION TECHNIQUE BEFORE.

389
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,958
THIS IS KILLING ME!

390
00:22:32,708 --> 00:22:33,875

I CAN FEEL HIS EYES ON ME,
BURNING THOUGH MY BACK.

395
00:23:01,833 --> 00:23:04,916
WE'RE CONNECTED JUST LIKE I
KNEW WE'D BE. THE TWO OF US,

396
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,458
ALONE OUT HERE.
JUST ME AND MY DARLING.

397
00:23:08,541 --> 00:23:10,833
I'VE NEVER HAD THIS
MUCH FUN BEFORE.

398
00:23:10,916 --> 00:23:12,583
I DON'T WANT THIS TO END.

I WANT TO KEEP DRIVING
LIKE THIS FOREVER.

400
00:23:18,083 --> 00:23:19,833
- THIS IS SO FREAKIN' WEIRD.

401
00:23:19,916 --> 00:23:22,041
DIFFERENT FROM THE
BATTLES I USUALLY RUN.

402
00:23:22,125 --> 00:23:25,666
IT'S ALMOST LIKE...
LIKE I'M COMFORTABLE.

403
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:27,916
BUT THE TENSION IS STILL
THROUGH THE ROOF.

404

405

- THE GOAL'S RIGHT
IN FRONT OF US.

406
00:24:04,125 --> 00:24:07,125
IF I KEEP UP MY SPEED I CAN
PULL THIS INTO A SECOND RUN.

407
00:24:13,708 --> 00:24:15,750
- THERE IT IS! I GOTCHA, BRO.

408
00:24:15,833 --> 00:24:17,708
THAT'S THE SINGLE
TURBINE'S WEAKNESS.

409
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:20,583
MAN, HOW COULD I HAVE
BEEN SO BLIND AND STUPID?

410
00:24:21,916 --> 00:24:23,666
WHY DIDN'T I
REALIZE IT SOONER?

411
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,083
HER CAR'S FAST WHEN
IT'S RUNNING SMOOTH,

412
00:24:33,166 --> 00:24:34,208
BUT DISRUPT IT'S RHYTHM

413
00:24:34,291 --> 00:24:37,250
AND THAT SUCKER'S
WEAKNESS IS OBVIOUS.

414
00:24:37,333 --> 00:24:39,041
I DON'T KNOW HOW RIGHT
I AM ABOUT THIS,

415
00:24:39,125 --> 00:24:41,750
BUT I'M BETTING THAT
SINGLE TURBO'S GOTTA BE PEAKY.

AND HER BOOST PRESSURE FELL.

418
00:24:56,375 --> 00:24:58,416
THIS IS IT! HERE'S WHERE
MY TWIN TURBO

419
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,125
AND IT'S MISSING LAG SHOWS
IT'S REAL WORTH!

420
00:25:04,625 --> 00:25:07,875
- NO. PLEASE DON'T PASS ME.

421
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:13,416
I WANT TO KEEP DRIVING.
I DON'T WANT THIS TO END.
