THE PROBABILITY TAKUMI IS GONNA

SOON ENOUGH HOW USELESS

LOSE YOUR LIFE IN THIS SHIT.

SO WHAT IF HE'S RIDIN' MY ASS?

00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:46,708
THERE'S NO WAY HE CAN PASS ME.

00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:14,125
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
I COULDN'T CARE LESS.

45
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,333
- YOU RECALL THAT BLIND
ATTACK TAKUMI PULLED OFF

46
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:19,083
IN THE FINAL ROUND AGAINST
THE TOUDOU SCHOOL?

47
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:21,250
- SURE. IT'S NOT LIKE
THAT'S SOMETHING

48
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:23,125
A GUY CAN JUST FORGET, YOU KNOW.

49
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:26,416
HE DROVE WITH HIS LIGHTS OFF
ON A MOUNTAIN PASS.

50
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,791
- YEAH, WELL, THE GENIUS BEHIND
THAT LITTLE MOVE,

51
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:31,500
IT'S THAT MINDSET THAT'S GONNA
SAVE HIM OUT THERE TONIGHT.

52
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:33,583
- HOW'S THAT EXACTLY?

53
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:35,500
- TAKUMI'S ABLE TO WORK
OFF AN IMAGE HE'S GOT

54
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:36,750
OF THE COURSE IN HIS HEAD.

55
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:38,416
EVEN WITH VISIBILITY
AT NEAR-ZERO

56
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,125
HE CAN NAVIGATE IT FROM MEMORY.

57
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:42,833
HE'S ONE OF A KIND.

58
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:44,000
I'VE NEVER SEEN
ANYTHING LIKE THE WAY

59
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:46,750
HE CAN VISUALIZE A COURSE.

60
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:49,208
SO LONG AS HE CAN ACCURATELY
GAUGE HIS OPPONENT'S SPEED,

61
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:50,666
HE CAN FOLLOW THEIR LINE.

62
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:54,083
UNDER ANY CONDITIONS.

63
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:57,708
ONE OF TAKUMI'S GREATEST ASSETS
IS HIS ABILITY TO FEEL THE ROAD

64
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:59,041
EVEN WHEN HE CAN'T SEE IT.

65
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:01,500
AND THAT'S WHAT SETS HIM
APART FROM OTHER DRIVERS.

66
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:04,958
- WHAT? HE'S STILL ON HIM?

67
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:06,666
ARE YOU SHITTIN' ME?

68
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,166
- TELL ME WHERE THEY ARE.

69
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:13,125
THEY'RE OVER ON THE S-CURVES.
RIGHT ABOUT MIDWAY THROUGH.

70
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:15,750
AT THIS RATE, WE WON'T
GET 'EM IN JUST ONE RUN.

71
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:17,875
- THAT WOULD BE UNFORTUNATE.

72
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:20,625
I WASN'T PREPARED FOR SAKAMOTO
TO LOSE.

73
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:23,166
I HAVE TO START THINKING OF A
STRATEGY FOR THE SECOND RUN

74
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,708
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

75
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:27,916
- WAIT, YOU MEAN FOR WHEN
THE CAPPUCCINO IS LIKE, CHASING?

76
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,750
- THIS IS NOT GOOD.

77
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:33,875
FOR STARTERS, I HADN'T THOUGHT
THERE'D BE A SECOND RUN.

78
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,125
CAN IT BE THE RAIN?

79
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:39,291
SAKAMOTO HAS ONLY BEEN
DRIVING THE CAPPUCCINO

80
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:41,791
FOR THE PAST WEEK OR SO,

81
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:44,333
AND TO WATCH OUR OPPONENT DRIVE,
YOU'D ALMOST THINK

82
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:47,375
HE AND THAT EIGHT-SIX CAME
OFF THE SAME ASSEMBLY LINE.

83
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:52,208
IF ONLY THE COURSE WERE DRY.
DAMN IT.

84
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:53,375
I NEVER THOUGHT IT POSSIBLE,

85
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:55,875
BUT HE'S PLAYING OUR OWN
ACE AGAINST US!

86
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:58,750
- ( engines revving )

87
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:12,416
- I DON'T LIKE THIS
ONE DAMN BIT.

88
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,250
HE'S ABOUT TO TRY
AND MAKE A MOVE.

89
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:17,875
I KNOW HE IS.
I CAN FEEL IT.

90
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:19,208
WHAT'S HE THINKIN'?

91
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:21,666
EVEN WITHOUT THE RAIN THE
CORNER'D BE TOO NARROW.

92
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:25,666
DON'T SCREW WITH ME, MAN!

93
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,000
JUST STAY BACK THERE ALL
NICE AND QUIET.

94
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:29,625
LIKE A GOOD LITTLE LOSER.

95
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:40,833
- THAT'S IT!

96
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:50,875
- WHAT?

97
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:02,625
DIDN'T I TELL YOU NOT TO SCREW
WITH ME, YOU LITTLE BITCH?

98
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:06,125
- DAMN, NO GOOD!

99
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:12,416
- JUST LIKE I THOUGHT.

100
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,791
HOW CAN I COUNTER-ATTACK
ON SOMEONE

101
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:15,750
WHO CORNERS FASTER THAN ME?

102
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:18,958
OKAY. I'VE ONLY GOT TIME LEFT
FOR ONE MORE SHOT!

103
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:21,041
THERE'S A FEW MORE CORNERS
COMIN' UP.

104
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:22,625
THERE'S GOTTA BE
AN IN SOMEWHERE.

105
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:26,500
THE NEXT ONE'LL BE MY LAST TRY.

106
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:28,708
IF RYOSUKE THINKS I CAN DO IT,

107
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:31,250
I KNOW I CAN TAKE
THIS SON OF A BITCH DOWN!

108
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:48,166
- IT WON'T BE
MUCH LONGER NOW, HUH?

109
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,000
- I GUESS NOT. YOU'RE RIGHT.

110
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:54,166
THAT'S ONE NIGHT
I'M NOT EVER GONNA FORGET.

111
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:57,583
WHEN TAKUMI PASSED ME.

112
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:59,750
I'D NEVER BEEN SO SHOCKED
IN MY LIFE.

113
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:05,458
- ( rain pattering )

114
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:09,166
- ( engine revving )

115
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:14,958
- I DON'T GIVE A CRAP IF
LIGHTWEIGHT BEATS FINE-TUNING.

116
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:17,000
HE'S NOT GONNA LOSE.

117
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:19,416
NOT TO THIS JACKASS, ANYWAY.

118
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,125
AND NOT 'CAUSE OF THE RAIN.

119
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:47,416
- ( tires screeching )

120
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:01,875
- GO FOR IT!

121
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:10,583
- SERIOUSLY? NOW?
HEY, IT'S YOUR FUNERAL, DUDE!

122
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:20,958
- I'M GOING IN!

123
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:37,083
- OH, MAN. I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED BACK THERE,

124
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:39,375
BUT THAT WAS WAY TOO CLOSE.

125
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,500
GREAT. HE'S MANAGED TO PULL AWAY
FROM ME AGAIN.

126
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,166
SO A COUNTER-ATTACK
WON'T WORK AFTER ALL.

127
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:48,625
STILL...

128
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:50,833
- THINK ABOUT KYOICHI SUTO,
HE AND THE EMPERORS,

129
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:53,541
HOW DO YOU THINK THEY COPE WITH
MESSY CONDITIONS LIKE THESE?

130
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:56,750
THAT'LL BE
THE KEY TO YOUR STRATEGY.

131
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:58,708
AND BEAR IN MIND THE POINT
HERE IS TO DO THE OPPOSITE

132
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:00,500
OF WHAT YOU'D NORMALLY DO.

133
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:05,333
EVERYTHING YOU KNOW HAS TO
BE LOOKED AT IN REVERSE.

134
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:06,708
- I STILL DON'T GET IT.

135
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:08,875
IF HE DOESN'T MEAN A
KYOICHI-STYLE COUNTER-ATTACK,

136
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:10,291
WHAT DOES HE MEAN?

137
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:16,416
- YES, THANK YOU. I UNDERSTAND.

138
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:19,833
YOU WERE RIGHT WHEN
YOU SAID MY ADVICE

139
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:21,625
WAS A LITTLE ABSTRACT EARLIER,

140
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:24,041
BUT IF HE CAN HOLD HIS OWN WITH
THE CAPPUCCINO FOR THIS LONG,

141
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:26,166
CHANCES ARE HE UNDERSTANDS.

142
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,125
THE BASIC POINT, AT LEAST.

143
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:31,750
ENOUGH TO GUIDE HIM
PROVIDED HE KNOWS HIMSELF.

144
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:34,875
- YEAH. BUT HOW WELL
DOES HE KNOW HIMSELF?

145
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:36,250
- HE'LL BE FINE IF
HE CAN KEEP UP

146
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:38,666
WHILE NEGOTIATING THE FIRST
AND MIDDLE SECTIONS.

147
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:41,625
THOSE ARE BY FAR THE TOUGHEST
SEGMENTS OF THE COURSE.

148
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:43,083
- SO WHERE HE SHOULD
MAKE HIS MOVE...

149
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:46,208
- EXACTLY. THE LAST STRETCH.
OVERTAKING THE OTHER GUY

150
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:47,291
WHERE BEING LIGHTWEIGHT

151
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:49,708
NO LONGER MAKES AN IOTA
OF DIFFERENCE.

152
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:51,375
- YEAH.

153
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:52,833
- KYOICHI AND HIS GANG
WOULDN'T HESITATE

154
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:54,500
TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT.

155
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:55,791
- YOU'RE RIGHT, THEY WOULDN'T.

156
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:57,166
AND THAT'S BY FAR
THE SAFEST PLACE

157
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:58,833
WHERE HE COULD TRY TO PASS.

158
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:01,333
- HMM. THE TRICK'LL
BE WHETHER OR NOT

159
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:04,000
THE SAFEST WAY IS
THE MOST OBVIOUS.

160
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:06,750
TAKUMI MAY HAVE TO WIDEN HIS
NOTION OF FAIR PLAY SOMEWHAT

161
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,291
TO TAKE THAT LEAP.

162
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:20,666
- FREAKIN' PERFECT.

163
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,375
THE LEVEL STRAIGHTAWAY WE'RE
COMIN' UP ON SOON

164
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:24,583
IS GONNA BE MY BIGGEST HEADACHE.

165
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:29,000
I AM NOT GONNA LET THIS CRAZY
BASTARD PASS ME!

166
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:32,958
I DON'T CARE WHAT I'VE GOTTA
PULL OUT OF MY ASS.

167
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:35,166
I'M DRAGGING THIS
INTO A SECOND RUN!

168
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:46,416
- I HADN'T THOUGHT
ABOUT THE STRAIGHTAWAY

169
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,916
RIGHT BEFORE THE FINISH.

170
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,041
IF I WANTED TO PASS HIM,
THAT'D BE MY BEST SHOT.

171
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:54,291
BUT SOMETHING'S NAGGIN' AT ME.

172
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:56,583
I MEAN, PASSING ON A
STRAIGHTAWAY AFTER LOSING TWICE

173
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:57,958
AT THE CORNERS?

174
00:11:58,041 --> 00:12:00,541
CAN YOU EVEN
CALL THAT A VICTORY?

175
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:02,791
AND WOULD RYOSUKE
WANT ME TO DO THAT?

176
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:07,458
HELL IF I KNOW. THERE'S NO
POINT IN WAFFLIN' NOW.

177
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:09,000
YOU HAVEN'T GOT TIME.

178
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:12,208
BUT I DON'T KNOW!
SHOULD I DO THIS OR NOT?

179
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:14,833
ARE YOU GONNA LET THIS JERK
DRAG US INTO A SECOND RUN?

180
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:17,208
COME ON, MAN, THINK!

181
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,083
- OKAY, IS HE GONNA COME AT ME
FROM THE RIGHT OR THE LEFT?

182
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:41,333
MAN. FOR MAINTAINING THE LEAD
ON A STRAIGHTAWAY,

183
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:43,458
THE SIZE OF THIS THING
IS WORTHLESS.

184
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:44,708
EVEN IF I KEEP TO THE MIDDLE,

185
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:46,875
THERE'S TOO MUCH ROOM
ON EITHER SIDE OF ME.

186
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:51,208
I DON'T WANNA DO THIS, DUDE,
BELIEVE ME.

187
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:53,750
BUT I'LL BE DAMNED
IF I'M GONNA GIVE YOU AN IN!

188
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:57,375
- WHICH IS IT? SHOULD I
MAKE A GO AT THIS OR NOT?

189
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:59,416
WHAT WOULD RYOSUKE
WANT ME TO DO?

190
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:01,458
- LEFT IT IS!

191
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,916
YOU ARE NOT GETTING
IN FRONT OF ME, PUNK!

192
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,208
NOBODY MESSES WITH A RALLYIST
AND LIVES TO TELL ABOUT IT!

193
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:22,250
- OKAY. YOU'RE WILLING TO GO
THAT FAR, HUH?

194
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:24,083
WELL, IN THAT CASE...

195
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,833
- HEY! I CAN TOTALLY SEE THEM,
YOU GUYS! CHECK IT OUT!

196
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:30,500
HERE THEY COME!

197
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:32,000
- ( tires screeching )

198
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:37,833
- HOLY CRAP!

199
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:42,708
- OH, MAN! THE EIGHT-SIX
JUST FREAKIN' VANISHED!

200
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:44,791
- YOU'RE IN FOR A RUDE AWAKENING
IF YOU THINK YOU CAN

201
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:47,333
CARRY THIS OVER INTO
ANOTHER RUN, TAKUMI.

202
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:54,000
DON'T GET HUNG UP
ON A CLEAN VICTORY.

203
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,125
IF STYLE MEANS SO MUCH TO YOU
YOU'RE WILLING TO LOSE,

204
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:58,375
THIS ISN'T THE GAME FOR YOU,
MY FRIEND.

205
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:00,250
WHAT DOESN'T GET US
OVER THAT FINISH LINE FIRST,

206
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:03,750
WE JUST GOTTA LEARN TO IGNORE.

207
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:05,583
IF YOU MISS YOUR CHANCE
TO PASS THIS GUY,

208
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:07,250
I KNOW IT'S NOT
'CAUSE YOU CAN'T.

209
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:09,291
IT'S 'CAUSE YOU WON'T.

210
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:12,708
STYLE IS WHAT YOU MAKE IT.
YOU CAN DO THIS, TAKUMI!

211
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:13,875
WIN IT!

212
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:19,625
- WHERE'D HE GO?
HE JUST FRIGGIN' DISAPPEAR?

213
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:21,166
WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON?

214
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,541
HIS HEADLIGHTS WERE PRACTICALLY
IN MY TRUNK A SECOND AGO,

215
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:25,625
WEREN'T THEY?

216
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:27,250
THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING!

217
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:32,000
- ( revving )

218
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:39,625
WHAT THE HELL?

219
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:44,375
- ♪ I BELIEVE IN LOVIN' YOU ♪

220

227
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,583
- IMPOSSIBLE. HOW COULD HE HAVE

233
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,625
YOU'D HAVE TO THINK
DIFFERENTLY ABOUT YOURSELF.

234
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:53,083
THE FIRST AND ONLY
THING A DRIVER

235
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:54,750
SHOULD CONCERN HIMSELF
WITH IS WHETHER OR NOT

236
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:57,375
HE CAN MAXIMIZE THE
POTENTIAL OF HIS VEHICLE.

237
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:58,625
WHEN IT'S ALL SAID AND DONE,

238
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:01,041
THERE'S REALLY NOTHING MORE
TO IT THAN THAT.

239
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:03,250
IF DURING A RACE YOU FIND
SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR CAR

240
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:04,583
THAT'S JUST PLAIN BETTER

241
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:06,583
THAN THE ONE YOUR OPPONENT
IS BEHIND THE WHEEL OF,

242
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:08,333
WELL, THEN THINK ABOUT IT,

243
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:10,916
AND NINE TIMES OUT OF TEN
THAT'LL BE YOUR INROAD.

244
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,416
TECHNIQUE IS THERE TO LEARN
HOW TO TRANSCEND IT.

245
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,583
THAT'S WHAT I WANTED YOU
TO WALK AWAY WITH TONIGHT.

246
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:17,958
WHEN I TOLD YOU TO THINK LIKE
KYOICHI I DIDN'T MEAN FOR YOU

247
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:19,458
TO EMULATE HIS TACTICS

248
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:21,916
OR TRY TO PULL OFF ONE OF HIS
SIGNATURE COUNTER-ATTACKS.

249
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,166
I WANTED YOU TO REALLY
GET INSIDE HIS HEAD.

250
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:28,125
THAT SAID, OF COURSE, MOST OF
YOUR BATTLE TONIGHT WAS DECIDED

251
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:30,333
IN THE FIRST HALF ANYWAY.

252
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:34,166
I'M IMPRESSED YOU STAYED ON
THE CAPPUCINO'S TAIL. GOOD JOB.

253
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:37,541
YOU CAN REST FOR NOW. THE TIMED
TRIAL HAS BEEN CANCELED.

254
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:44,750
- HELL OF A RACE, MAN.

255
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:47,291
- HE DID MEAN THAT
AS A COMPLIMENT, RIGHT?

256
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:48,750
- ( chuckling )

257
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:53,791
- TO BE HONEST WITH YOU,

258
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:56,666
I'M KINDA HAVING TROUBLE
COMING TO TERMS WITH IT.

259
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,750
I KNOW I HAD TO PASS HIM
LIKE THAT TO PULL THE WIN,

260
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:00,333
BUT IT DIDN'T FEEL RIGHT.

261
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:03,666
IT TOOK ME SO LONG TO FIGURE OUT
I ALMOST LOST THE RACE.

262
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:07,416
AND I THOUGHT ABOUT JUST HOLDIN'
OFF AND WAITIN' ON A SECOND RUN.

263
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,583
- WELL, IT'S A DAMN GOOD THING
YOU DIDN'T DO THAT.

264
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:11,458
IF YOU HADN'T MADE YOUR MOVE
WHEN YOU DID,

265
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:13,666
RYOSUKE WOULD'VE TORN YOU
A NEW ONE FOR SURE.

266
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:16,125
- HUH? YOU... YOU THINK SO?

267
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:19,083
- I KNOW SO. THERE'S NO
GUARANTEE THE RAIN

268
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:21,750
WOULD'VE LASTED THROUGH
ANOTHER RUN, NOW WAS THERE?

269
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:22,916
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT,

270
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,708
THE WEATHER IS WHAT HAD
YOUR BACK TONIGHT.

271
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:27,041
IF THE ROAD HAD BEEN DRY,
THAT PINK PIECE OF CRAP

272
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:29,625
WOULD'VE WIPED THE ROAD
WITH YOU. NO CONTEST.

273
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:32,583
- OKAY. YEAH.
I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.

274
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:34,750
- KEEP IN MIND, IF THIS WAS
YOUR OWN PERSONAL BATTLE,

275
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:37,375
YOU COULD'VE DONE WHATEVER
YOU DAMN WELL PLEASED OUT THERE.

276
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:38,958
BUT WHEN YOU'RE
RACING FOR PROJECT D,

277
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:41,166
YOU'RE DEFENDING ALL
OUR REPUTATIONS.

278
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,708
DON'T FORGET THAT.

279
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:47,125
- MAN! I DON'T BELIEVE
THIS CRAP!

280
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:48,875
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED
TO YOU OUT THERE, DUDE?

281
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:51,250
HOW DO YOU GET BEATEN
BY AN EIGHT-SIX, SERIOUSLY?

282
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:53,583
WE HAD THIS THING
IN THE GODDAMN BAG!

283
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:55,750
WHAT DO YOU
HAVE TO SAY FOR YOURSELF?

284
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:57,375
- LOOK, I DON'T KNOW.

285
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:59,375
THE WHOLE SITUATION
THROWS ME, OKAY?

286
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:01,833
ONE MINUTE I CAN SEE HIM IN MY
REARVIEW MIRROR, AND THE NEXT,

287
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:03,833
HE'S FRIGGIN' GONE
LIKE SOME SORT OF GHOST.

288
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,333
- YOU SAY HE DISAPPEARED,

289
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:07,416
BUT SURELY THE GUY WAS JUST
DRIVING IN YOUR BLIND SPOT?

290
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,125
- I'D HAVE SEEN HIM
MOVE INTO IT, THOUGH.

291
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:10,750
BY THE TIME I REALIZED
WHAT WAS HAPPENING,

292
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:12,750
HE WAS ALREADY
RIGHT ALONGSIDE ME.

293
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:15,291
- BY THE TIME YOU REALIZED
HE HAD YOUR ASS YOU MEAN.

294
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:16,458
START TALKING SENSE,

295
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:18,583
'CAUSE NOBODY CAN JUST UP
AND DISAPPEAR.

296
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:20,208
- THEN YOU PUT IT HOWEVER
YOU WANT TO.

297
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:22,000
I CAN'T EXPLAIN
WHAT I DON'T GET.

298
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:24,291
BELIEVE ME, NO ONE'S MORE
SHOCKED ABOUT THIS THAN ME.

299
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:26,916
- WELL, YEAH. I'M JUST SAYIN'.

300
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,125
I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE EITHER ONE
OF YOU HAD ANY BETTER LUCK

301
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,833
AGAINST THE EIGHT-SIX, RIGHT?

302
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:33,291
I'VE HAD ABOUT ALL OF THIS
I CAN TAKE.

303
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:36,750
I JUST HOPE THE OTHER RALLY
DRIVERS DON'T HEAR ABOUT THIS.

304
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:41,333
NO TELLIN' HOW LONG IT'LL TAKE
FOR ME TO GET OVER IT.

305
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:42,666
I DON'T KNOW, MAN.

306
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,500
THERE'S JUST SOMETHIN'
DIFFERENT ABOUT THAT GUY.

307
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:50,125
IT'S LIKE HE'S NOT EVEN HUMAN.

308
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:55,208
- ANY WAY YOU SLICE IT,
A BLIND ATTACK IN THE RAIN

309
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:57,500
WAS ONE HELL OF
AN EFFECTIVE TACTIC.

310
00:18:57,583 --> 00:18:59,000
IT'S HARD ENOUGH TO
SEE COMIN' AT YOU

311
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:00,541
UNDER THE BEST OF CONDITIONS.

312
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:02,916
SO TO HIM IT MUST'VE LOOKED
LIKE YOU VANISHED INTO THIN AIR.

313
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:08,916
IT'S A POWERFUL TOOL TO HAVE
UNDER YOUR BELT IN A DOGFIGHT.

314
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,375
RYOSUKE THINKS SO, TOO.

315
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:14,666
- YEAH, MAYBE IT IS,
BUT I DON'T WANNA USE IT OFTEN.

316
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:17,166
THIS MAY SOUND STRANGE,
BUT BETWEEN YOU AND ME,

317
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,916
I JUST DON'T LIKE
THE WAY IT FEELS.

318
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,750
IT'S TOO MUCH OF AN EASY OUT,
YOU KNOW?

319
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:23,083
- YOU CALL PULLIN' OFF
THAT KINDA MOVE EASY?

320
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:26,041
- WELL, YEAH. LIKE A REFLEX,
I GUESS.

321
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:27,416
IT'LL KINDA HIT ME
OUT OF THE BLUE,

322
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,416
LIKE WHEN MY OPPONENT
WON'T OPEN UP A PATH FOR ME,

323
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,500
OR MAYBE JUST WHEN I GET
REALLY PISSED OFF OR SOMETHIN'.

324
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:34,291
I DON'T KNOW.
- THERE'S OUR CHAMPION!

325
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:35,541
HEY, TAKUMI!

326
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:41,375
DUDE! YOU WERE SO THAT GUY'S
WORST NIGHTMARE!

327
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:43,666
OF COURSE, YOU TOTALLY SCARED
THE BE-JESUS OUTTA US.

328
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,416
WE LOST SIGHT OF YOU
THERE FOR A SEC.

329
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,416
- HE'S RIGHT.
IT WAS THE DAMNEDEST THING.

330
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,375
- SORRY ABOUT THAT.
( chuckling )

331
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:52,250
- YOU NEARLY RAN OVER
YOUR THREE BEST FRIENDS,

332
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:53,583
BUT WE FORGIVE YA,

333
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:56,250
SEEIN' AS HOW YOU'RE A
COMPLETE GOD. ( laughing )

334
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:57,958
- NEXT TIME, MAYBE
TRY NOT STANDING

335
00:19:58,041 --> 00:19:59,291
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD.

336
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:02,375
- ( car starting )
- WAIT. HEY, IS THAT...

337
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:05,958
- ( revving )

338
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:08,333
- THAT LEVIN! COULD IT BE...

339
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,375
THAT BABY BELONGS TO WATARU!

340
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:13,333
- WELL, YEAH.
YOU JUST NOW NOTICED?

341
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:15,541
HE'S REPRESENTING OUR
OPPONENTS IN THE HILL CLIMB

342
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:16,958
ABOUT TO HAPPEN HERE
IN A LITTLE BIT.

343
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:18,833
- ( explosion )
- ( screaming )

344
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:23,166
- WHAT? BUT IF WATARU'S AROUND,
THAT MEANS SHE MIGHT BE TOO!

345
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:34,291
K... KAZUMI IS HERE?

346
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:38,166
- ( heart beating loudly )

347
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:45,458
- KAZUMI!
- HUH?

348
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:47,875
- ( spluttering )
DO YOU REMEMBER ME?

349
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:50,583
( spluttering nervously )

350
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,041
- ITSUKI, HEY!

351
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,708
- A COMPRESSOR, HUH?

352
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:07,750
YOU SWITCHED OVER TO
A SUPER-CHARGER?

353
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:09,250
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

354
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:12,250
AFTER LOSING TO THE TRUENO
LAST FALL, IT OCCURRED TO ME.

355
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:14,208
WELL, LET'S JUST SAY
THE TURBO AND ME

356
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:16,625
DECIDED TO GO OUR SEPARATE WAYS.

357
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:18,916
THE ENGINE WAS GIVIN' ME
MORE GRIEF THAN IT WAS WORTH,

358
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,791
SO I CAME UP WITH A
PRETTY DECENT SOLUTION

359
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:23,666
IF I DO SAY SO MYSELF.

360
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:26,291
THE KIND OF IMMEDIATE RESPONSE
YOU GET FROM A SUPER-CHARGER

361
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:28,750
ISN'T ALL THAT DIFFERENT
FROM AN NA.

362
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:31,166
BUT YOU DON'T GET ALL THE
NIT-PICKY B.S. WITH THIS PUPPY

363
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,500
LIKE YOU DO WITH TURBO, SO IT'S
A LOT LIKE SWITCHING OVER

364
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,208
TO A LARGE DISPLACEMENT ENGINE.

365
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:37,333
AND DAMN NEAR PERFECT
FOR THE TYPE OF COURSE

366
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:39,250
YOU AND I ARE GONNA RUN TONIGHT.

367
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:41,833
KEEP THAT IN MIND
WHEN YOU SEE MY TAIL LIGHTS.

368
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:45,500
- OKAY, I GET IT. SO THAT'S HOW
IT'S GONNA BE. TELL YOU WHAT.

369
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:47,041
IF YOU WANNA LEARN
HOW TO DRIVE A TURBO,

370
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:48,833
THEN JUST FOLLOW MY LEAD.

371
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:51,958

IS THE SAME AS LAST WEEK'S.

374
00:22:27,916 --> 00:22:30,416
YOU UNDERSTAND ME?
THE ROAD CONDITIONS TONIGHT

375
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,750
WILL BE VIRTUALLY THE SAME
AS THEY WERE FOR THAT RACE.

376
00:22:32,833 --> 00:22:34,541
-OKAY, BRO.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

377
00:22:34,625 --> 00:22:36,666
YOU GUYS JUST WATCH ME
DO MY THING, ALL RIGHT?

378
00:22:37,416 --> 00:22:38,416

389
00:23:51,333 --> 00:23:55,000
I JUST HAD A TURBO INSTALLED IN
MY LEVIN, TOO, BUT I MEAN, DAMN!

390
00:23:55,083 --> 00:23:56,750
- OH, THE OLD TURBO IS HISTORY.

391
00:23:56,833 --> 00:23:59,333
HE'S HAD THAT PUPPY OUTFITTED
WITH A SUPER-CHARGER.

392

- HE'S GOT A SUPER-CHARGER?

393
00:24:01,333 --> 00:24:02,458
- YEAH. HE BLEW OUT
THE OLD ENGINE

394
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:04,250
TRYING TO BEAT YOUR
FRIEND ON AKAGI.

395
00:24:04,333 --> 00:24:06,916
MAN, I'D NEVER SEEN
WATARU SO TICKED OFF BEFORE.

396
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,750

THAT'S GOIN' A BIT OVERBOARD,
DON'T YOU THINK?

402
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:21,416
