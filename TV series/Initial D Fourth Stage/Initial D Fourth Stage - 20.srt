IN ORDER TO WIN, YOU'LL HAVE
TO APPROACH THIS BATTLE

8
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:19,083
FROM A DIFFERENT ANGLE.

9
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:23,041
YOU NEED TO TRUST ME. THIS ISN'T
EXACTLY THE KIND OF THING

10
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:24,791
I WOULD NORMALLY ASK YOU TO DO.

11
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:26,666
- I'M OPEN TO IDEAS, BRO.

12
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:30,583
- YOU'RE TAKING THE LEAD?

13
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:33,208
- THAT'S THE PLAN.
UNLIKE MY FRIEND HERE,

14
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:35,583
I DON'T NEED TO STUDY
MY OPPONENT'S EVERY MOVE

15
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:37,416
TO KNOW HOW TO WIN.

16
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,166
BESIDES, I CAN'T AFFORD
TO DRAG THIS OUT.

17
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,000
MY CAR IS A LITTLE HEAVY.

18
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:45,166
IF I LET UP, THEY COULD USE
THAT TO THEIR ADVANTAGE.

19
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,708
I'LL MAKE IT QUICK.

20
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:48,041
- ( he chuckles )

21
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:49,666
- DON'T BE TOO SURE.

22
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:52,166
I DON'T NEED TO REMIND YOU,
YOU DO HAVE A TENDENCY

23
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,666
TO GET A LITTLE COMPLACENT WHEN
YOU THINK THERE'S NO CHANCE

24
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,458
YOU COULD LOSE.

25
00:02:57,541 --> 00:02:59,083
I'M NOT SAYING I
THINK YOU WILL.

26
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:02,416
BUT THERE'S NO SUCH THING
AS A SURE THING.

27
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:06,875
- WORRYING LIKE THAT WILL
GIVE YOU AN ULCER YOU KNOW.

28
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:09,500
IT'S LIKE I SAID, I'LL KEEP
UP THE MOMENTUM

29
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:11,583
AND THIS WILL BE
OVER PRETTY QUICK.

30
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:13,833
THEY'RE NEVER GONNA EVEN
KNOW WHAT HIT'EM.

31
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,250
- I DON'T KNOW 'BOUT THIS.

32
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:22,791
I MIGHT BE ABLE TO PULL IT OFF,

33
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:24,875
BUT IT SURE AS HELL
WON'T BE EASY.

34
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:26,958
- NOBODY SAID THIS
WOULDN'T BE CHALLENGING.

35
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:31,041
- ASSUMING EVERYTHING GOES
ACCORDING TO YOUR SIMULATION,

36
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:33,041
- WHAT'S THE ABSOLUTE
MOST TIME I CAN GIVE HIM

37
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:34,458
AT THE TURNING POINT?

38
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:35,833
- I'D SAY...

39
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:38,458
SEVEN SECONDS.

40
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:39,625
- WHAT?!

41
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:41,083
- SEVEN SECONDS?

42
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:45,583
- OUR PERFECT RECORD
IS RIDING ON THIS, KEISUKE...

43
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:47,583
JUST BE SURE TO
KEEP THAT IN MIND.

44
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:48,708
- RIGHT.

45
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,416
- OKAY, DRIVERS TO
THE STARTING LINE!

46
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:16,333
- ALRIGHT EVERYONE,

47
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:18,583
ON MY COUNT!

48
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:23,750
FOUR... THREE... TWO...
ONE... GO!

49
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:27,458
- ( up-tempo music playing )

50
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:38,625
- AWAY THEY GO.

51
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:41,500
HOSHINO KNOWS WHAT HE NEEDS
TO DO IN ORDER TO WIN.

52
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:44,750
WHEN YOU'VE DRIVEN AS LONG AS HE
HAS, YOU LEARN A FEW THINGS.

53
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:54,500
- DON'T LET UP.
NOT EVEN FOR A SECOND.

54
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:57,083
C'MON BIG GUY. GIVE IT
EVERYTHING YOU GOT

55
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:58,583
AND THEN SOME.

56
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:22,500
- LOOKS LIKE IT'S STARTED.

57
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:24,125
- YEP, LOOKS LIKE IT.

58
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:26,625
- KEISUKE'S UP AGAINST
KOUZOU HOSHINO.

59
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:27,833
MOST PEOPLE KNOW
HIM AS GOD FOOT

60
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:30,125
BECAUSE OF HIS EXPERTISE
WITH ACCELERATORS.

61
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:32,208
EVEN SOMEONE LIKE KEISUKE
HAS GOT TO BE FEELING

62
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:34,375
A LITTLE NERVOUS.

63
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:36,791
- JUST MEETING WITH THEM LAST
NIGHT MADE ME NERVOUS.

64
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:39,916
I CAN'T PUT MY FINGER ON IT, BUT
SOMETHING IS SERIOUSLY OFF

65
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
ABOUT THOSE GUYS.

66
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:43,458
- TRY NOT TO GET PSYCHED OUT.

67
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:45,791
YOU'RE GOING TO BE GOING UP
AGAINST GOD ARM.

68
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:48,458
AND WE'LL NEED STAY ON TOP OF
OUR GAME FOR THAT, ALRIGHT?

69
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:56,416
-HERE.

70
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:58,083
WE.

71
00:05:58,166 --> 00:05:59,208
GO!

72
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:04,666
DORYAA!

73
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:10,666
- WELL, WELL... YOU'VE GOT
A FEW TRICKS UP YOUR SLEEVE,

74
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:13,208
PRETTY SMOOTH
FOR SUCH A HEAVY RIDE.

75
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:21,875
- AGE COMES BEFORE BEAUTY,
LITTLE MAN! EAT MY DUST!

76
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:31,083
( tires screeching )

77
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,416
- LOOKS LIKE THE RACE
HAS ALREADY STARTED.

78
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,875
- WAIT A SECOND, WHY ARE THEY
STARTING WITH THE HILL CLIMB?

79
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:43,166
- IT'S NOT JUST GONNA BE
JUST AN UPHILL.

80
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,416
I HEARD SOMEBODY
SAY THEY'RE RACING

81
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,291
AN UPHILL AND DOWNHILL TONIGHT.

82
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:48,291
- THEY'RE DOING
A COMBINATION RACE?

83
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:50,416
- THAT'S RIGHT. A HILL
CLIMB FOLLOWED BY

84
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,916
A DOWNHILL IS ONE RUN.

85
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,625
THEY KEEP RUNNING THE
COURSE OVER AND OVER

86
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:55,541
UNTIL THERE IS A CLEAR WINNER.

87
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:04,000
- I HAVEN'T SEEN KOUZOU
HOSHINO RACE IN FOREVER,

88
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:06,833
NOT SINCE HE WAS STILL DRIVING
THAT R32 AROUND.

89
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:09,000
MAN THAT OLD GUY CAN
REALLY DRIVE.

90
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:11,625
I WENT TO THIS RANDOM MEET AT
TSUKUBA CIRCUIT JUST CAUSE

91
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:14,250
SOMEBODY TOLD ME HOSHINO WAS
GONNA BE RACING THAT DAY.

92
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:17,250
I GOT TO SEE HIM ACTUALLY DRIFT
HIS R32 THE ENTIRE WAY

93
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:19,083
THROUGH THE FINAL CORNER.

94
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:21,041
SEEING SOMETHING LIKE
THAT ISN'T THE KIND OF THING

95
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:22,750
YOU CAN EVER FORGET.

96
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:27,625
THE ATTESA-ETS ON THE
GT-R CAN BE A REAL BITCH

97
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:28,875
IF YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

98
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:30,250
AND YOU CAN FORGET TRYING
TO DRIFT WITH IT,

99
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:31,625
IT'S TOO HEAVY.

100
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:33,791
IT JUST WASN'T DESIGNED
FOR THAT KIND OF DRIVING.

101
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:35,958
THE SECOND THE ETS
DETECTS A TAIL SLIDING,

102
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:39,041
IT KICKS IN AND STARTS TO SPIN
THE FRONT TIRES.

103
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,791
- I DIDN'T KNOW THAT!

104
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:42,000
BUT TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST,

105
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:43,875
I'M CLUELESS ABOUT FOUR
WHEEL DRIVES.

106
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:47,041
- IT'S LIKE THIS, IF YOU PULLED
BACK YOUR COUNTER STEER

107
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:48,250
AND STEPPED ON THE ACCELERATOR,

108
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:49,708
YOU COULDN'T MAINTAIN
A SLIDE ANGLE.

109
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:53,083
WHICH IS WHY I PREFER THE FR
OVER THE GT-R.

110
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:55,458
THE TRACTION FROM THE FRONT
TIRES WILL AUTOMATICALLY TAKE

111
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:58,166
HOLD OF THE ROAD AND THE CAR
WILL STOP DRIFTING INSTANTLY.

112
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:03,291
IT'S A LIABILITY IF YOU ASK ME.
AND AS IF THAT'S NOT BAD ENOUGH,

113
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:06,416
THE ATTESA-ETS DECIDES HOW
TO DISTRIBUTE POWER

114
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,666
TO THE FRONT TIRES AS YOU
STEP ON THE ACCELERATOR.

115
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,666
WHICH MEANS THAT IF YOU RELY
ON YOUR LIGHT FOOTWORK

116
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:13,291
ON THE THROTTLE, YOU'RE ONLY
MAKING IT ALL THE MORE DIFFICULT

117
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:14,541
TO MAINTAIN A SOLID DRIFT.

118
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:16,875
- BUT I THOUGHT YOU SAID
HOSHINO'S GT-R DRIFTED

119
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:18,541
IN THE BATTLE YOU SAW HIM RUN?

120
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:20,833
- YEAH THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT
SO MEMORABLE...

121
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:23,833
CHIEF WAS THERE TOO AND EVEN HE
COULDN'T EXPLAIN HOW HE DID IT.

122
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:25,333
COME TO THINK OF IT,

123
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:28,500
THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE NEARLY LEFT
HIM COMPLETELY SPEECHLESS.

124
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:30,125
- WISH I BEEN THERE TO SEE THAT.

125
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:32,708
- I'M NOT GONNA LIE,
IT WAS PRETTY HILARIOUS.

126
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:35,416
ANYWAYS, LIKE I WAS
SAYING, I THINK HOSHINO MIGHT BE

127
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,750
THE ONLY GUY WHO COULD PULL
SOMETHING LIKE THAT OFF.

128
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:40,416
- I'M STARTING TO GET WHY THE
CHIEF WAS PUSHING SO HARD FOR US

129
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,333
TO COME AND WATCH THIS
PARTICULAR RACE.

130
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:45,750
- ME TOO. I GUARANTEE YOU, THERE
ISN'T A SINGLE PERSON OUT HERE

131
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:48,458
THAT COULD WORK A PEDAL
THE WAY KOUZOU HOSHINO CAN.

132
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:50,166
I MEAN THEY DON'T CALL
THE GUY GOD FOOT

133
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,916
BECAUSE HE CAN WALK
ON WATER, YOU KNOW.

134
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,250
- THE CHIEF WAS SPOUTING OFF
ABOUT TONIGHT'S RACE EARLIER ON.

135
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:58,833
HE SAID HE'D BE SHOCKED IF
PROJECT D WAS ABLE TO WIN,

136
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:01,083
AND I THINK I SEE
WHAT HE MEANT BY THAT.

137
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:04,291
- YEAH. I DO KNOW ONE THING
FOR SURE THOUGH...

138
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:06,458
THIS RACE IS GOING TO BE
SOMETHING ELSE.

139
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:17,333
- I'VE HAD THE GT-R THREE-TWO,

140
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:19,416
THE THREE-THREE, AND
THE THREE-FOUR.

141
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,458
NOTHING ELSE ON THE ROAD
HANDLES LIKE THESE BABIES.

142
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:25,000
AFTER I GOT BEHIND THE WHEEL
OF MY FIRST THREE-TWO,

143
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:27,833
I KNEW I'D FINALLY FOUND THE
RIDE FOR ME.

144
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:30,333
AND I GOT THE LARGER SECOND
GENERATION THREE-THREE,

145
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:33,166
WHICH TURNED OUT TO BE A
TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT.

146
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,250
THAT CAR WAS A WASTE OF TIME.

147
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:36,875
READY, SET.

148
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:39,250
DORYAA!

149
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:44,166
IT DIDN'T TAKE LONG FOR
ME TO GET RID OF THAT

150
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,041
PIECE OF CRAP 3-3 AND
BUY ANOTHER 3-2.

151
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:49,958
THIS IS THE FOURTH GT-R
I'VE OWNED.

152
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:52,375
THE GT-R THREE-FOUR!

153
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,416
OKAY...

154
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,500
HE'S KEEPING UP.
NO BIG SURPRISE THERE.

155
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:10,375
- DAMN, HE'S FAST.

156
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:17,041
I LET MYSELF GET COCKY BECAUSE
OF ALL THE MODIFICATIONS WE DID

157
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:18,250
TO THE FD.

158
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:20,250
THAT WAS A BIG MISTAKE.

159
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:23,583
MAN, THIS GT-R DRIVES
LIKE IT'S ON RAILS!

160
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:40,208
- SITTING IN WITH
HOSHINO DURING A RACE

161
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:42,625
IS PRETTY FREAKIN' WILD DUDE.

162
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:46,083
- I BET IT IS. IS IT TRUE THAT
HE TALKS TO HIMSELF?

163
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:49,041
- HE YELLS "DORYAA"
OR "BRING IT ON".

164
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:51,083
BUT I DON'T THINK
ANYBODY KNOWS WHY.

165
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:52,583
- MAN THAT IS SO WEIRD.

166
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:55,750
THEN AGAIN, I GUESS EVERY
DRIVER HAS HIS LITTLE QUIRKS.

167
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:57,875
MAYBE THAT'S JUST THE WAY
HE KEEPS HIS FOCUS.

168
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:59,541
BUT WHATEVER, IT WORKS.

169
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:02,416
- SEEMS TO ME THAT IF I TRIED
THAT IT'D HURT MY CONCENTRATION

170
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,750
MORE THAN HELP.

171
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:05,166
BUT I DO KNOW THAT EITHER
WAY I WOULD FEEL LIKE

172
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,458
ONE CRAZY BASTARD,
THAT'S FOR SURE.

173
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:10,583
- YEAH. MOST PEOPLE CLAM UP
WHEN THEY ARE TRYING

174
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:12,791
TO CONCENTRATE, BUT HOSHINO
ISN'T MOST PEOPLE.

175
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:15,791
- LISTEN TO THEM. IT'S
ADORABLE HOW HARD

176
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:18,250
THEY'RE TRYING TO
FIGURE IT ALL OUT.

177
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:20,958
CONCENTRATION THROUGH SHOUTING?

178
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:24,166
AW, HOW I MISS BEING
YOUNG AND NAIVE.

179
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:28,958
- BRING IT ON!

180
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:32,208
LET'S DO THIS!

181
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:45,000
- DESPITE WHAT SOME MAY THINK...

182
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:48,916
HOSHINO HAS A TENDENCY TO
OVERTHINK HIS STRATEGY.

183
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,375
THE MORE HE THINKS
ABOUT SOMETHING,

184
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:52,500
THE MORE WORKED UP HE GETS.

185
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:55,458
TALKING TO HIMSELF KEEPS HIM
FROM CONCENTRATING TOO HARD.

186
00:11:57,458 --> 00:11:59,458
I DON'T KNOW HOW HE CAME UP
WITH IT.

187
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:01,666
BUT IT REALLY SEEMS TO HELP
HIM BEHIND THE WHEEL.

188
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:07,625
MY CURIOSITY SOMETIMES GETS THE
BETTER OF ME...

189
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:10,458
I HAVE TO WONDER WHAT HOSHINO
WOULD BE LIKE AS A DRIVER

190
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:12,333
WITHOUT HIS LITTLE TECHNIQUE.

191
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:14,500
I KNOW ONE THING FOR
SURE THOUGH...

192
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:16,458
AS WILD AS HE IS NOW,

193
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:19,666
I DOUBT HE'D BE THE KIND OF
DRIVER I WANT ON MY TEAM.

194
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:22,583
- DON'T MESS WITH ME!

195
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:30,166
- TRY AND KEEP A LEVEL HEAD
OUT THERE, OLD FRIEND.

196
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,875
I'M COUNTING ON YOU.

197
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:34,791
DON'T GO WASTING TIME
SHOWING OFF...

198
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:37,750
YOU'RE NOT A KID ANYMORE.

199
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:40,000
- WHAT I WOULDN'T GIVE FOR
A COLD FRONT RIGHT NOW.

200
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:42,833
- LET ME GET YOU A DRINK, SIR.
YOU GOTTA STAY HYDRATED.

201
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:47,208
HERE YOU GO.

202
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:48,333
- APPRECIATE IT.

203
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:51,458
- YOU ARE SWEATING A LOT.

204
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:53,208
YOU SURE IT'S JUST THE
WEATHER, SIR?

205
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:58,458
ONCE YOU GET TO BE MY AGE, HEAT
CAN REALLY DO A NUMBER ON YOU.

206
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,166
- MAN-O-MAN... I FREAKIN'
LOVE THIS CAR!

207
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:12,083
THE THREE-TWO I HAD BEFORE THIS,
HAD ITS SHARE OF MINOR PROBLEMS

208
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,916
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT CAME TO THE
UNDER STEERING.

209
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,541
NOT THE THREE-FOUR THOUGH...
THIS CAR WAS MADE FOR ME.

210
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:22,291
PEOPLE THAT DON'T KNOW ANY
BETTER THINK MERCEDES

211
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:23,750
AND FERRARIS ARE THE BEST
CARS ON THE STREET

212
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:27,458
JUST 'CAUSE THEY COST
AN ARM AND A LEG.

213
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:30,250
I COULD BUY BOTH CARS TOMORROW
AND NEITHER ONE OF THEM

214
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:32,416
WOULD HOLD A CANDLE TO THE GT-R.

215
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:34,958
THEY'RE THE WAY TO GO.

216
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:36,833
GT-R, BABY!

217
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:50,750
OH YEAH!

218
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:55,500
COME ON!

219
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:17,125
- TELL ME SOMETHING.

220
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:18,500
IN OTHER BATTLES, IT SEEMS
LIKE YOU PRETTY MUCH

221
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:22,458
LET KEISUKE DO WHATEVER
THE HELL HE WANTS.

222
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:23,708
I WAS JUST
WONDERING WHAT IT WAS

223
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:26,041
THAT MAKES TONIGHT SO DIFFERENT.

224
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:27,541
- IN CASE YOU HADN'T NOTICED,

225
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:29,833
THESE GENTLEMAN AREN'T YOUR RUN
OF THE MILL STREET RACERS.

226
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:31,916
- TRUST ME,
I DEFINITELY NOTICED.

227
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,250
- THEY'RE AT AN ADVANTAGE.

228
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:35,583
WHEN IT COMES TO THE UPHILL,

229
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:38,916
TIRE MANAGEMENT IS BY
FAR THE IMPORTANT FACTOR.

230
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,833
WE HAVE TO PLAY THIS SMART.

231
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:43,125
WE TRY TO COMPETE WITH THE FOUR
WHEEL DRIVE GT-R,

232
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:46,458
THE TIRES ON KEISUKE'S FD ARE
BOUND TO WEAR OUT.

233
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:48,250
- BUT WHAT ABOUT KEISUKE'S
ACCELERATOR WORK?

234
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:51,250
I MEAN, YOU HAVE TO ADMIT THAT
HE'S GOTTEN A LOT BETTER LATELY.

235
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:54,041
- I KNOW HE HAS.

236
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:57,166
THAT'S WHY HE ISN'T MY MAIN
CONCERN AT THE MOMENT.

237
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:59,833
SOMEONE ELSE IS WELL VERSED
IN ACCELERATORS.

238
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:02,916
- YEAH. AND I'M GUESSING HE
GOES BY THE NICKNAME GOD FOOT.

239
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,250
- HOLDING OFF ON THE HILL CLIMB

240
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:05,791
AND MAKING A MOVE
ON THE DOWNHILL

241
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:07,958
IS PRETTY MUCH OUR ONLY
OPTION NOW.

242
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:09,583
- I DO SEE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING...

243
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:11,416
BUT IT JUST SEEMS TO ME...

244
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,125
THAT SEVEN SECONDS IS CUTTING
IT A LITTLE BIT CLOSE.

245
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:15,458
ARE YOU SURE ABOUT
THIS RYOSUKE?

246
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:17,166
WHAT IF SOMETHING GOES
WRONG OUT THERE?

247
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:20,583
THOSE SEVEN SECONDS WILL STILL
GIVE US THE WINDOW WE NEED.

248
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:24,208
A RACE CAN CHANGE DRAMATICALLY
IN LESS TIME.

249
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:26,083
I'M ASKING A LOT OF KEISUKE,

250
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:28,500
BUT HE'S FULLY CAPABLE OF
PULLING THIS OFF.

251
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:29,875
I'M CERTAIN OF IT.

252
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:34,833
YOU WERE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT WHEN
YOU SAID HIS ACCELERATOR WORK

253
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:37,458
HAD IMPROVED, FUMIHIRO.

254
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:40,666
BUT WHETHER HE'S SMART ENOUGH
TO PUT IT TO GOOD USE...

255
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,041
THAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN.

256
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:48,875
- I DON'T KNOW, BRO. THIS IS
ONE HELL OF A RISKY MOVE.

257
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:50,416
I HOPE I CAN MAKE IT WORK...

258
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,541
BUT I DON'T KNOW, THIS GEEZER
IS PRETTY DAMN FAST.

259
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:56,416
IF I CAN'T REGAIN THE SEVEN
SECOND LEAD ON THE DOWNHILL,

260
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,333
ALL OF THIS WILL
HAVE BEEN FOR NOTHING.

261
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,875
REGAINING A LEAD IS A TALL ORDER
IN JUST ABOUT ANY RACE,

262
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:09,875
AND THROWING STRATEGY INTO THE
MIX DOESN'T HELP.

263
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:14,500
I GUESS I SHOULDN'T
BE SURPRISED...

264
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:18,583
BRO WOULDN'T ASK ME TO DO
SOMETHING IF IT WAS EASY.

265
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:22,083
DON'T GET COMFY, GRAMPS.
I'M ABOUT TO TAKE THE LEAD.

266
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:27,500
- KEEP IT STEADY...

267
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:29,541
NOT JUST YET.

268
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:38,041
- I GOT THIS. IF BRO THINKS
I CAN DO IT, I KNOW I CAN.

269
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:39,791
CONCENTRATE...

270
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:42,041
JUST FOCUS ON MOVING
YOUR RIGHT FOOT!

271
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:56,833
- YEA BABY!

272
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:04,416
- BADASS!

273
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,583
- I'M TELLIN YA... HOSHINO'S
GOT THIS THING IN THE BAG!

274
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:09,666
- NO WAY THAT FD CAN TAKE
THE LEAD AWAY FROM HIM NOW.

275
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,291
- WHAT'S UP WITH PROJECT D?

276
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:14,125
I HEARD THEY HAD AN AMAZING
DRIVER RACING TONIGHT.

277
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:17,416
- YOU DUMBASS! HOSHINO EATS
CHUMPS LIKE THAT FOR BREAKFAST.

278
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,458
THEIR FD COULD NEVER KEEP UP
WITH HIS GT-R-THREE-FOUR.

279
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:22,166
- THEY SHOULD GO AHEAD
AND CALL THIS THING,

280
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,625
SAVE US ALL SOME TIME.

281
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:26,041
PURPLE SHADOW IS
GONNA DESTROY PROJECT D.

282
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:49,583
- I SEE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO
DO. THAT'S AN IMPRESSIVE MOVE.

283
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:51,708
PRETTY GOOD FOR A KID HIS AGE.

284
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:54,208
THERE AREN'T MANY DRIVERS
NOWADAYS THAT WOULD EVEN ATTEMPT

285
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:56,291
WHAT HE'S TRYING TO PULL OFF.

286
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:02,333
IF I WERE IN HIS POSITION,

287
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:03,958
I'D MADE A MOVE FOR
THE LEAD ALREADY.

288
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:07,500
BUT I'M NOT KNOWN
FOR MY PATIENCE.

289
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:09,333
THAT STILL DOESN'T MEAN I
SHOULD UNDERESTIMATE

290
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:11,958
WHAT THIS KID COULD
BE CAPABLE OF.

291
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:15,166
NOW LET'S GO!

292
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:23,750
- PROJECT D
KEEPS FALLING BEHIND.

293
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:26,125
MAN, WHAT'S THE FD'S DEAL?

294
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:29,166
THIS RACE COULD BE OVER
PRETTY SOON.

295
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:32,666
ANOTHER FLAWLESS VICTORY
FOR THE PURPLE SHADOW, HUH?

296
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,875
- NOT QUITE YET.

297
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:36,583
LOOKS LIKE PROJECT D IS WORKING
THIS FROM A DIFFERENT ANGLE

298
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:38,875
BY USING THE VARIABLE
SPEED RULE.

299
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:40,833
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

300
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:42,416
- THE GT-R HAS THE ADVANTAGE
ON THE HILL CLIMB

301
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,291
BECAUSE OF ITS
SUPERIOR TRACTION.

302
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:46,375
BUT THE FD ACTUALLY HAS THE
ADVANTAGE ON THE DOWNHILL

303
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,125
BECAUSE IT'S LIGHTER.

304
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:50,333
IF KEISUKE DOESN'T PUT TOO
MUCH STRESS ON HIS TIRES

305
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:51,416
DURING THE HILL CLIMB,

306
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,083
THE DUDE MIGHT BE ABLE
TO MAKE A PLAY

307
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:54,708
FOR THE LEAD ON THE DOWNHILL.

308
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:56,958
- INTERESTING.

309
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:58,916
BUT WAIT, IF WHAT
YOU'RE SAYING IS TRUE

310
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,250
THEN THAT MEANS PROJECT D

311
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:02,708
IS TRYING TO OUTSMART
HOSHINO BY STAYING BEHIND?

312
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:06,250
- THEY'RE TAKING A HUGE
GAMBLE BY USING THIS STRATEGY.

313
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:08,750
NOT TO MENTION IT'S PRETTY
DAMN BALLSY OF THEM

314
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:11,541
TO TRY SOMETHING LIKE THIS ON
SOMEBODY LIKE KOUZOU HOSHINO.

315
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:14,000
IF THEY AREN'T ABLE TO CATCH UP
TO HIM IN TIME ON THE DOWNHILL,

316
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:15,458
THEY'LL GONNA BE TOTALLY SCREWED

317
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:16,666
- FOR REAL.

318
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,875
- THINGS ARE ABOUT TO GET
A LITTLE CRAZY.

319
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:21,750
THAT'S A BOLD MOVE,
RYOSUKE TAKAHASHI.

320
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:24,708
MAN, CAN'T WAIT TO SEE HOW
THIS'LL TURN OUT.

321
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:27,750
SERIOUSLY, KOUZOU HOSHINO IN AN
ALL-OUT DOWNHILL BATTLE

322
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,750
WITH KEISUKE TAKAHASHI.

323
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:32,833
THEY'RE BOTH AMAZING DRIVERS
WITH THE SOMETHING TO PROVE.

324
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:35,208
THE TWO OF THEM HAVE TO KNOW
WHAT'S AT STAKE HERE.

325
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:38,416
I GOT TO ADMIT DUDE, I'M GETTING
PUMPED JUST THINKING ABOUT IT.

326
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:49,541
- OKAY, I'M READY. THIS IS WHAT
ALL THAT TRAINING WAS FOR...

327
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:51,500
ALRIGHT. BRING IT ON OLD MAN!

328
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,541
TIME TO STOP LAGGING BEHIND.

329
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:57,041
THAT LEAD IS MINE.

330
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:27,416
- THEY'RE ALMOST HERE.

331
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,333
- I JUST HEARD PEOPLE SAYING
THAT KEISUKE'S RUNNING BEHIND...

332
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:41,083
THERE'S NO WAY THAT COULD
REALLY BE TRUE, RIGHT.

333
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:43,208
- WELL IT MIGHT BE.
YOU GOT TO ADMIT,

334
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:45,833
THE GT-R DOES HAVE HIM
AT A DISADVANTAGE.

335
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:49,416
- KEISUKE MUST FEEL LIKE CRAP
RIGHT NOW.

336
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,041
I KNOW I WOULD.

337
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:54,000
I THINK IT'S PROBABLY SAFE TO
SAY THAT HE'S NEVER HAD

338
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:56,166
THAT HAPPEN TO HIM BEFORE.

339
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,333
LOSING AN OPPONENT IN THE
MIDDLE OF A RACE LIKE THIS

340
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:00,541
COULD MAKE OR BREAK
YOU AS A DRIVER.

341
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:01,666
TRUST ME.

342
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:14,291
MAN, I'D HATE TO BE IN
HIS SHOES.

343
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:16,541
TRYING TO MAINTAIN
CONCENTRATION DURING A RACE

344
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:18,750
IS HARD ENOUGH WITHOUT HAVING
TO WORRY ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT

345
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:20,750
YOU'RE GOING TO CATCH UP TO
THE OTHER DRIVER IN TIME.

346
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:22,666
AND WITH EVERYTHING ELSE
TO FOCUS ON.

347
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,458
- NO KIDDING.

348
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:27,208
- OH, PLEASE.
KEISUKE HAS WHAT IT TAKES.

349
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:32,041
- STAY FOCUSED.
KEEP UP THE PACE...

350
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:34,375
IF I'M GOING TO KEEP MY LINE
THROUGH THIS NEXT CORNER

351
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:36,541
I HAVE TO MAINTAIN THIS SPEED.

352
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:39,625
REMEMBER NOT TO PUT TOO MUCH
STRESS ON THE TIRES.

353
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:40,958
- ( tires screeching )

354
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:49,166
- AT THE END OF THE CORNER, OPEN
UP THE THROTTLE AND BOOK IT.

355
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:27,875
- I'M SURE YOU RECALL KEISUKE
ACTUALLY STARTED TO PERFECT

356
00:22:27,958 --> 00:22:30,333
HIS ACCELERATOR WORK DURING
OUR BATTLES IN SAITAMA.

357
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:32,666
HE DIDN'T REALIZE HE NEEDED TO
UNTIL THEN.

358
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:33,833
IT COULDN'T HAVE
BEEN EASY FOR HIM

359
00:22:33,916 --> 00:22:35,083
TO ACKNOWLEDGE
HIS SHORTCOMINGS,

360
00:22:35,166 --> 00:22:36,416
BUT LOOK HOW MUCH HE'S IMPROVED

361
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,875
BECAUSE OF ALL THE HARD
WORK HE'S PUT IN.

362
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:40,291
EVEN I WAS SHOCKED BY
HOW QUICKLY

363
00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:41,750
HE LEARNED THOSE TECHNIQUES.

364
00:22:41,833 --> 00:22:44,000
AND BY HOW QUICKLY HE
MASTERED THEM.

365
00:22:44,083 --> 00:22:45,416
- WHEN KEISUKE SETS HIS
MIND ON SOMETHING,

366
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,666
IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME TILL
HE MAKES IT HAPPEN.

367
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:49,291
THIS BATTLE IS FAR FROM OVER.

368
00:22:49,375 --> 00:22:51,458
IF HE WANTS TO WIN THIS THING,
HE'S GONNA HAVE TO PULL OUT

369
00:22:51,541 --> 00:22:53,083
ALL THE STOPS.

370
00:23:02,541 --> 00:23:04,500
- ( engines in the background )

371
00:23:06,083 --> 00:23:07,125
- THEY'RE COMING!

372
00:23:13,416 --> 00:23:15,416
- HEY WHO'S IN THE LEAD?

373
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,791
- DUDE, I THINK THAT'S
HOSHINO'S GT-R!

374
00:23:17,875 --> 00:23:19,583
- THE FD IS NOWHERE
TO BE SEEN...

375
00:23:19,666 --> 00:23:22,125
THIS ISN'T A BATTLE,
IT'S A DAMN MASSACRE!

376
00:23:24,208 --> 00:23:25,375
- HERE WE GO!

377
00:23:27,541 --> 00:23:28,583
WHOO-YA!

378
00:23:32,791 --> 00:23:34,041
- ( laughing and cheering )

379
00:23:34,125 --> 00:23:36,250
- HELL YEAH!
- HE'S SO COOL!

380
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:43,333
- TANGO WITH
MY THREE-FOUR

381
00:23:43,416 --> 00:23:45,416
AND YOU'RE ONLY
GOING TO REGRET IT.

382
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:17,541
- YEAH! YOU CAN DO IT!

383
00:24:20,541 --> 00:24:21,708
- ( cellphone rings )

384
00:24:24,541 --> 00:24:27,833
- HELLO? HEY, KENTA.
HOW MANY SECONDS WAS IT?

385
00:24:30,125 --> 00:24:32,000
OK, I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER.
THANKS FOR THE CALL.

386
00:24:33,625 --> 00:24:36,083
HE SAID HE COUNTED AT THE
TURNAROUND. IT WAS SIX SECONDS.

387
00:24:36,166 --> 00:24:37,458
JUST UNDER.

388
00:24:37,541 --> 00:24:38,541
- I SEE...

389
00:24:43,291 --> 00:24:45,625
NICELY DONE LITTLE BRO...

390
00:24:45,708 --> 00:24:46,791
YOU WERE ABLE TO HOLD YOUR OWN

391
00:24:46,875 --> 00:24:48,958
AGAINST SOMEONE YOU
COULDN'T EVEN SEE.

392
00:24:50,333 --> 00:24:51,958
BUT DON'T EASE UP.

393
00:24:52,041 --> 00:24:53,791
THE REAL GAMBLE IS
JUST BEGINNING.

394
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,125
- ( theme plays )
