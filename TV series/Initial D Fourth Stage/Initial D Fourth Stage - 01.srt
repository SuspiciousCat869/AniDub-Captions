00:01:48,958 --> 00:01:51,166
- Tohru: FINALLY,
THEIR PAGE IS UP!

10
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,958
CHECK IT OUT. PROJECT D.

11
00:01:54,041 --> 00:01:55,833
I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY WON AGAIN.

12
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:57,375
- Atsuro: THAT'S A
COURSE RECORD.

13
00:01:57,458 --> 00:01:58,958
- Tohru: AMAZING. THEY'VE
WON EVERY MATCH

14
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:00,958
ON EVERY OPPONENT'S
TURF THEY'VE HIT.

15
00:02:01,041 --> 00:02:03,458
- Nao: SO, WHAT'S A PROJECT D?

16
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:05,166
- Atsuro: YA KNOW REE-YO-SKAY
TAKAHASHI, RIGHT?

17
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,458
- Nao: I'M NOT BLIND.
THAT SUPER HOT GUY?

18
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:09,875
- NYWAY, HE PUT TOGETHER THIS
SPECIAL TEAM TO COMPETE WITH

19
00:02:09,958 --> 00:02:12,083
OTHER TEAMS OUTSIDE
HIS PREFECTURE.

20
00:02:14,958 --> 00:02:17,916
- Tohru: HE USES HIS COMPUTER
TO LURE IN THE CHALLENGERS,

21
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,291
THEN HE POSTS THE RESULTS
ON HIS WEB PAGE.

22
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,791
HE PUTS THE OPPONENT'S
NAMES UP THERE.

23
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:32,041
HELL, EVEN THE ROAD NAMES GO UP.

24
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,208
SO, ARE THEY COMING OUT OR NOT?

25
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:51,041
- FROM WHAT I'VE HEARD, I THINK
WE'LL PROBABLY SEE THEM SOON.

26
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:54,458
THEY WERE LAST SEEN ON OSAGIRI
HIGHWAY NOT TOO LONG AGO.

27
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:55,958
- WELL IT'S ABOUT TIME.

28
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:58,041
GUESS I'LL GO AHEAD
AND DO THE DOWNHILL.

29
00:02:58,125 --> 00:02:59,541
THE UPHILL'S ALL YOURS.

30
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:01,333
YOUR THIRTY-FOUR WILL
HANDLE IT BETTER.

31
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:03,333
- Atsuro: YEAH. THAT'S WHAT
I WAS THINKIN' TOO.

32
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:08,458
- I DON'T KNOW HOW FIERCE THE
COMPETITION IS OVER IN GUNMA.

33
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:10,875
BUT I WANNA SHOW THESE GUYS

34
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:14,000
WE'LL REDEFINE THE TERM "GETTING
BURNED" IF THEY MESS WITH US.

35
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:23,083
- Nao: ARE YOU SERIOUS?
NOT MORE NEW TIRES.

36
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:27,000
DIDN'T YOU JUST BUY NEW ONES
A COUPLE UH WEEKS AGO?

37
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:29,750
- YEAH, BUT THOSE WERE JUST
CHEAP LITTLE PLACE HOLDERS.

38
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:32,666
THEIR GRIP STINKS
OUTSIDE OF THE CITY.

39
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:35,291
I'M GONNA NEED TO
GET A NEW SET.

40
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:37,791
THAT'S HOW I'LL WIN THOSE
TIME ATTACKS. I KNOW IT.

41
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:44,083
NAO, PLEASE.
YOU GOTTA HELP ME.

42
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:47,000
WHEN I GET MY SUMMER BONUS
I'LL PAY YOU BACK, I PROMISE.

43
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:51,625
- YOU'VE ALWAYS SPENT TOO MUCH
MONEY ON YOUR STUPID CAR.

44
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:53,166
- HUH?

45
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,666
- IT WOULD JUST BE NICE IF YOU
PUT SOME OF YOUR MONEY AWAY

46
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,041
WITH OUR FUTURE IN MIND.

47
00:03:57,125 --> 00:04:00,750
SIX YEARS! TOHRU, HOW LONG
DO YOU EXPECT US TO DO THIS?

48
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:02,083
THE WAY THINGS HAVE BEEN GOING,

49
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:04,666
I DON'T SEE US EVER
GETTING MARRIED.

50
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:07,625
- GREAT.
MY FAVORITE TOPIC AGAIN.

51
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:10,000
DO YOU KNOW HOW SICK I AM
OF HEARING ABOUT THIS?

52
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,875
- DO YOU KNOW HOW SICK I AM
OF BRINGING IT UP

53
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:13,500
'CAUSE YOU NEVER LISTEN?

54
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:23,125
OK. IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT,
I'LL LEND YOU THE MONEY.

55
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:26,500
- YEAH? YOU WILL?
YOU'RE A LIFE SAVER, BABE!

56
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:28,708
- BUT THERE'S ONE CONDITION.

57
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:31,708
- YEAH, WHAT KIND?

58
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:34,375
- THE KIND THAT SAYS
YOU QUIT RACING ALL TOGETHER,

59
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:36,416
IF YOU LOSE THIS NEXT BATTLE.

60
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,208
- BUT YOU CAN'T MEAN THAT.

61
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:40,958
- I'M SERIOUS THIS TIME,
SO YOU BETTER HEAR ME.

62
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:42,250
I MEAN IT.

63
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:45,041
BREAK THIS PROMISE AND
I'LL LEAVE YOU FOR GOOD.

64
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:46,708
YOU'LL NEVER SEE ME AGAIN.

65
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,541
- ( car revving )

66
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:06,875
- THESE NEW TIRES FEEL GREAT.
JUST WHAT I NEEDED.

67
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:13,625
THIS BATTLE IS MINE. I MEAN,
NAO IS IMPORTANT TO ME, BUT...

68
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:20,500
THERE'S JUST NO WAY
I'M EVER QUITTING RACING!

69
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:21,875
- ( tires screeching )

70
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:25,625
- TOHRU, THEY'RE HERE!

71
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:29,041
- ( tires screeching )

72
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:33,583
- PROJECT D.
FINALLY, YOU SHOW YOURSELF.

73
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:38,208
- THAT'S AN FD.

74
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:41,125
WHAT'S THAT? AN EIGHT-SIX?

75
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:51,583
- WHOA. THESE GUYS REALLY KNOW
HOW TO MAKE AN ENTRANCE.

76
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:53,000
THEY MIGHT BE TOUGH.

77
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:09,416
- HEY, RYOSUKE, GET UP. WE'RE
HERE. COME ON IT'S TIME.

78
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:11,875
RYOSUKE!

79
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:14,791
IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT HE'S DOING.

80
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,625
HIS CONCENTRATION IS
ALWAYS AMAZING.

81
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:18,541
WISH I COULD DO THAT.

82
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:20,791
HE HASN'T WOKEN UP ONCE
SINCE WE LEFT TAKASAKI.

83
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:22,916
NOT EVEN FOR A DRINK
OR TO USE THE CAN.

84
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,166
- MY BROTHER
UNDERSTANDS EFFICIENCY.

85
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,916
HE'S GOT MANY TALENTS,
THAT'S JUST ONE.

86
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:33,041
- HEY, MATSUMOTO. SORRY, MAN,
COULD YOU SNAG ME A WATER?

87
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:34,458
- YEAH, SURE.

88
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,208
- LET'S BEGIN.

89
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:56,166
- HOW'S IT GOING?

90
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,833
WE'RE PROJECT D,
FROM THE GUNMA AREA.

91
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:01,916
- PEOPLE KNOW US AS
THE SEVEN STAR LEAF.

92
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,958
ON THIS MOUNTAIN,
WE'RE THE MAIN TEAM THAT RACES.

93
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:05,291
WE'RE THE ONES TO BEAT.

94
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:07,875
SO NATURALLY YOU GUYS'LL BE
DRIVING AGAINST US.

95
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:10,208
- THAT SOUNDS GOOD,
WE'RE ALL READY TO GO.

96
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:12,750
NOW, I'M SURE SOMEONE CONTACTED
YOU ABOUT THIS EARLIER,

97
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,166
BUT, WE'D LIKE TO
PRACTICE HERE TONIGHT,

98
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,916
IF IT'S ALRIGHT WITH YOU.

99
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,291
THAT WAY, WE CAN BE
FULLY RESTED

100
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:19,000
AND PREPPED FOR
TOMORROW NIGHT'S RACE.

101
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:22,500
- I HEAR YA.
I GOT NO PROBLEM WITH THAT.

102
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:25,291
IF MY EYES AREN'T LYING,
YOU GUYS ONLY BROUGHT AN FD

103
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:27,333
AND AN EIGHT-SIX WITH YOU.

104
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:30,041
ONLY TWO CARS TO START?

105
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:33,041
WE SPECIALIZE IN BATTLING
OPPONENTS FAR AWAY.

106
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:34,875
THIS IS THE RESULT OF THAT.

107
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:36,541
WE'VE GOTTEN MORE EFFICIENT.

108
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:39,666
THE EIGHT-SIX IS FOR DOWNHILL.

109
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,833
THE FD IS FOR UPHILL.

110
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:46,000
AND THESE TWO GUYS
ARE OUR DOUBLE ACES.

111
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:49,958
ALRIGHT, WE'LL GET STARTED THEN.

112
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,041
- THEY'RE A LOT MORE POLITE
THAN I EXPECTED THEY'D BE.

113
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:59,541
RACERS USUALLY AREN'T THE
FRIENDLIEST GUYS.

114
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:01,250
- ( air hissing )

115
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:04,083
- I THOUGHT IT WAS WEIRD THAT
THEY ONLY BROUGHT TWO CARS,

116
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:07,166
BUT WHAT'S WITH THE THREE VANS?
ARE THEY SUPPORT UNITS?

117
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,625
WHAT ARE THEY HIDING IN THERE?

118
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:12,250
- THE EIGHT-SIX'S FINAL SETTINGS
ARE LOCKED IN AND READY.

119
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:15,041
WITH THE CHANGES WE MADE THEY'RE
LOOKING SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

120
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:19,875
- THIS ISN'T A NORMAL
RACING TEAM.

121
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:24,125
RACERS USUALLY RIDE TOGETHER.
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME.

122
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:28,875
I MEAN, THREE SUPPORT VANS FOR
TWO CARS, I DUNNO ABOUT THAT.

123
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:31,333
A TEAM'S A TEAM, BUT AM I
THE ONLY ONE HERE WHO THINKS

124
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:34,000
THESE GUYS LOOK MORE LIKE
PROFESSIONAL CIRCUIT RACERS?

125
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:36,375
- LOOK, THEY JUST DO THIS CRAP
TO TRY TO PSYCHE US OUT.

126
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:37,500
YOU CAN'T LET 'EM.

127
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:38,708
WHAT DO YOU THINK THEY
CAN ACCOMPLISH

128
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:40,500
WITH ONE NIGHT OF PRACTICE?

129
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:42,125
WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS
FOR TWO YEARS.

130
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:44,083
THAT'S TWO YEARS MORE
THAN THEY HAVE.

131
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:46,000
I MEAN, COME ON,
WE MUST'VE DRIVEN THIS COURSE

132
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:47,833
LIKE A THOUSAND TIMES ALREADY.

133
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:50,708
THEY COULD HAVE TWENTY SUPPORT
UNITS OUT HERE. WHO CARES?

134
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:54,041
WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT,
IT'S DRIVER VERSUS DRIVER.

135
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:55,916
AND I DON'T EXACTLY
PLAN ON LOSING,

136
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,291
'SPECIALLY TO ANY
ONE POINT SIX LITER!

137
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:00,458
THIS IS MY TURF.

138
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:03,208
NO CRAP EIGHT-SIX IS
GONNA TAKE ME DOWN.

139
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:07,333
- OKAY. I UNDERSTAND.
THIS'LL WORK.

140
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:09,916
GIVE FUJIWARA THE BASIC RUNDOWN,
HAVE HIM THINK ABOUT IT,

141
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,208
THEN TELL HIM TO GET WITH ME
IF HE HAS ANY IDEAS.

142
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:13,625
- RIGHT.

143
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:16,125
- I DON'T WANT TO GO INTO
TOO MUCH DETAIL RIGHT NOW.

144
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:17,708
BUT THIS IS IMPORTANT.

145
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:20,208
HE SHOULD START THINKING
ABOUT THINGS ON HIS OWN.

146
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:21,833
- SURE, I GOTCHA.

147
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:25,000
- ( machine whirring )

148
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:28,416
- HAVE YOU SEEN THAT VIDEO YET?

149
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,083
- YEAH, I'VE WATCHED IT
LIKE FORTY TIMES ALREADY.

150
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:35,500
- I'M ASSUMING THAT MEANS YOU'VE
MEMORIZED THE COURSE, THEN?

151
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:39,208
FOR YOUR FIRST FIVE RUNS, I ONLY
WANT YOU AT SEVENTY PERCENT.

152
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:41,458
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
WATCHING THE VIDEO

153
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:42,916
AND ACTUALLY DRIVING
THE COURSE.

154
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,458
BUT, I HOPE YOU PUT THAT
TOGETHER ALREADY.

155
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:48,416
FIRST AND FOREMOST YOU GOTTA
ADJUST TO THAT DIFFERENCE.

156
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,041
- SURE.

157
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:52,416
- KEISUKE, YOU UNDERSTANDING
WHAT I'M SAYING TOO, RIGHT?

158
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,625
YOU BRING UP
YOUR PACE ONLY AFTER

159
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:55,041
YOU'VE GOTTEN USED
TO THE DIFFERENCE.

160
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:57,833
- YEAH. YOU DON'T HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT A THING.

161
00:09:57,916 --> 00:09:59,750
- OKAY. THEN, GO.

162
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:03,000
- ( car revving )

163
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,291
- I'M GOING TOO.

164
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,291
AS LONG AS MY TIRES ARE SOLID,

165
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:30,666
I'M READY TO GIVE
IT ALL I'VE GOT.

166
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,083
- ( tires screeching )

167
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:43,041
- Atsuro: YOU MAY BE
RIGHT, TOHRU.

168
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:49,208
WHAT COULD THEY ACCOMPLISH
IN JUST ONE NIGHT?

169
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:54,041
THAT'S THE FRAME OF MIND
WE HAVE TO PUT OURSELVES IN

170
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:55,291
IF WE'RE GONNA WIN THIS.

171
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:57,416
THE MOMENT YOUR WHEELS
CROSS ONTO THAT COURSE,

172
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,625
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO CHANGE THE WAY

173
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:00,666
YOU'VE BEEN THINKING ENTIRELY.

174
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:04,875
THE ONLY THINGS YOU CAN
TRUST ON THE ASPHALT

175
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:06,708
ARE YOUR DRIVING TECHNIQUE,

176
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:09,208
AND THE CAR YOU'RE
HOLDING ONTO.

177
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:10,750
- ( tires screeching )

178
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:21,208
- ( yawning )

179
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:23,458
'KAY I'M HEADING OUT.

180
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:24,833
- MMM.

181
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:48,583
- THANK YOU FROM COMING IN!

182
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:55,583
- ( humming)

183
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:58,166
( laughing )

184
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:01,708
- YOU'RE IN A GOOD MOOD TODAY,
ITSUKI. WHY'S THAT?

185
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:04,708
- C'MON, WHY WOULDN'T I BE,
IKTANI? DID YOU ALREADY FORGET?

186
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:07,625
CUZ IT'S T-MINUS ONE DAY
TO FREAKIN' PAYDAY!

187
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:09,541
- OH, YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

188
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:11,000
YOUR FIRST BIG CHECK.

189
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:13,750
FIRST ONE SINCE JOINING
THE RANKS OF THE FULL TIMERS.

190
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:16,333
- IT FEELS WAY DIFFERENT FROM
WHEN I WAS WORKING PART TIME,

191
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:18,250
LIKE I'VE MATURED OR SOMETHING.

192
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:21,166
I FEEL LIKE I'VE ACTUALLY
BECOME AN ADULT.

193
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:24,708
- SO, MR ADULT, WHERE'S YOUR
FIRST PAYCHECK GOING?

194
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:27,000
- I'VE ALREADY MADE UP MY MIND.

195
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:29,583
IT'S GOING INTO A TURBO FOR
MY SWEET ASS EIGHT-FIVE!

196
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,916
- NOT THAT PIECE OF JUNK?

197
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
- NOW, BLOWING BY CARS
LIKE YOUR S-THIRTEEN...

198
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:37,666
( whooping )

199
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:41,125
...WILL BE EASIER THAN
EATING CAKE ON MY BIRTHDAY!

200
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:42,541
I ALREADY GOT A LOAN ESTIMATE

201
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:44,958
AND THE DUDE SAYS
IT'S LOOKING GOOD!

202
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:46,750
- YEAH?

203
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:49,166
- EVERY DAY I'M CLOSER
TO LIVING MY DREAMS!

204
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:51,958
THE EIGHT-FIVE OF AKINA

205
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:55,208
WILL SOON BECOME A LEGENDARY CAR
AMONG THE RACERS OF THE WORLD!

206
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:57,833
- SO YOU SAY.

207
00:12:57,916 --> 00:13:00,541
- ( Itsuki making
driving noises )

208
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:02,666
I WANT TO BE ABLE TO TACKLE
THOSE MOUNTAIN PASSES

209
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,000
LIKE TAKUMI DOES!

210
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:05,916
- ( chuckles )

211
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,958
- YEAH, SPEAKING OF TAKUMI,
I WONDER WHAT HE'S UP TO.

212
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:11,125
HAVEN'T HEARD FROM HIM
IN A WHILE.

213
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:39,458
- THERE'S SOMETHING THAT'S
BEEN ON MY MIND SINCE LAST YEAR.

214
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:41,958
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT
MY DREAM IN LIFE.

215
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:48,000
ALL WINTER LONG, IT WAS ON MY
MIND. IT'S ALL I THOUGHT ABOUT.

216
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:50,208
I FINALLY FIGURED IT OUT.

217
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:52,541
WHAT I WANT TO DO IS DRIVE.

218
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:56,958
I WANNA DRIVE FASTER THAN THE
NEXT GUY, FASTER THAN ANYONE.

219
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:59,750
SO, I'VE DECIDED TO BE A
PROFESSIONAL DRIVER.

220
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:12,500
- ( crying )
I WANT TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

221
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:17,958
I DON'T CARE WHEN IT IS,
BUT SOMEDAY.

222
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:23,666
- Man: FUJIWARA?

223
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:27,541
YO, FUJIWARA. WAKE UP.

224
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:29,833
- OH, HEY.

225
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:32,291
- ALWAYS DAYDREAMING
LIKE A LITTLE GIRL.

226
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:34,708
ARE YOU DONE FOR THE DAY
OR AREN'T YOU?

227
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:37,541
- UH, YEAH.
I'M ON THE EARLY SHIFT.

228
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:38,916
- YOU GOT A HOT DATE?

229
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:43,166
- I DON'T... WELL, NOT REALLY.

230
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:46,500
- NOT REALLY? AND YOU'RE
SO YOUNG. SUCH A SHAME.

231
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:58,708
- Fumihiro: HOLY CRAP.
THESE GUTTERS ARE WIDE OPEN.

232
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:01,500
- RYOSUKE SAID SOMETHING
ABOUT IT TO ME.

233
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:04,416
BUT I DIDN'T EXPECT THEM
TO BE QUITE LIKE THIS.

234
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,375
- YEAH, I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN,
BACK IN GUNMA, THEY USE PANELS.

235
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:09,916
USUALLY, THE GUTTERS ARE
COMPLETELY COVERED IN CONCRETE.

236
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,291
IT WAS SO DARK DURING THE
PRACTICE RUNS LAST NIGHT,

237
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:13,375
THEY DIDN'T STAND OUT.

238
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:14,916
BUT IF EVEN ONE OF
YOUR TIRES DIPS

239
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,625
INTO THESE GUTTERS
AT RACING SPEEDS,

240
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:18,416
YOUR UNDERCARRIAGE
WILL BE TOTALED.

241
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,666
- YOU KNOW, I WAS THINKING,

242
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:22,125
WHEN RYOSUKE MENTIONED
THIS LAST NIGHT,

243
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:24,291
HE MUST HAVE BEEN
WARNING ME.

244
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:27,250
HE TOLD ME THAT, "HOW YOU
OVERCOME THESE GUTTERS

245
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:29,791
IN THE RACE WILL WIN
OR LOSE IT FOR YOU."

246
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:33,416
- HE CAN SAY WHAT HE WANTS,

247
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,458
BUT THE BEST WE CAN DO IS JUST
BE CAREFUL NOT TO FALL IN.

248
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:42,125
LOOK, WE'RE JUST GOING TO
HAVE TO TRUST HIM.

249
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:44,166
THERE'S A LOT RYOSUKE KNOWS,

250
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,750
AND WE DON'T ALWAYS
UNDERSTAND WHAT HE MEANS

251
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:47,916
UNTIL THE VERY LAST
HAND IS DEALT.

252
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,375
AND THEN,

253
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:52,625
IT ALWAYS ENDS THE SAME.

254
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:55,666
IT'S EXACTLY THE WAY
HE PREDICTS IT'LL BE.

255
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,291
YOU CAN COUNT ON IT.

256
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:03,916
- Tohru: THIS TIME I BORED OUT
THE SIXTEEN HUNDRED V-SIX

257
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,125
TO AN EIGHTEEN HUNDRED.

258
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:07,833
I PUT IN HIGH
COMPRESSION PISTONS

259
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:09,666
AND A LIGHTENED FLY WHEEL,

260
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,916
AND THAT WAY SHE'LL GET
HER RESPONSE TIME A LOT CLOSER

261
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,541
TO THE LEVEL WE NEED IT.

262
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:16,458
THEN, I PUT IN QUAD-VALVE
SPORTS FUEL INJECTORS.

263
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:18,833
SHE'S A REAL BAD GIRL.

264
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:20,500
- IF YOU COMBINE WHAT YOU
GOT UNDER THE HOOD

265
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:22,166
WITH YOUR DRIVING
TECHNIQUE, TOHRU,

266
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,291
SOUNDS TO ME LIKE THE
ULTIMATE DOWNHILL MACHINE.

267
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:25,916
I GOTTA ADMIT, I'M JEALOUS.

268
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,416
- WITH ALL OF THIS, THERE'S NO
WAY I CAN LOSE. NO WAY.

269
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:34,416
- ( car revving )

270
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:48,708
- SO TELL ME BUNTA,

271
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:51,541
YOU STILL MAKING TAKUMI DO ALL
OF THE TOFU DELIVERIES?

272
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:54,166
- YEAH, IT'S NOT LIKE THINGS
HAVE REALLY CHANGED MUCH.

273
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,500
- BUT THE KID'S ALSO WORKING
ANOTHER FULL TIME JOB

274
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:57,500
DURING THE DAY.

275
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,083
THAT'S A LITTLE MUCH.

276
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:03,416
- LOOK HE CAN HANDLE IT, BESIDES
I DON'T EVER HEAR HIM COMPLAIN.

277
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,958
AND HE'S ACTUALLY BEEN WORKING
HARDER THAN EVER BEFORE.

278
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:07,375
- WELL, THAT'S TRUE.

279
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:11,583
- THAT PROJECT D TEAM
HAS BEEN GOOD FOR HIM.

280
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:14,250
THINK IT'S GIVEN HIM
SOME REAL MOTIVATION.

281
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,958
- YEAH, THEY'RE UNDEFEATED.

282
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:20,166
AND APPARENTLY THEY'RE BREAKING
RECORDS ALL OVER THE PLACE.

283
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:23,041
- SURE. THEY'RE THE ONES
TO BEAT RIGHT NOW,

284
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,833
BUT SOME DAY

285
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:29,291
THEY WILL LOSE.

286
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:37,291
- Man 1: ABOUT TIME! I'VE BEEN
WAITING FOR THIS RACE FOREVER!

287
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:40,541
- Man 2: I WONDER IF PROJECT D
IS AS AWESOME AS THEY SAY?

288
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:42,666
- Man 3: IT DOESN'T MATTER.
ANY WAY YOU LOOK AT IT,

289
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:45,375
THE DOWNHILL BELONGS
TO THE SEVEN STAR LEAF.

290
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:48,000
I MEAN, TOHRU LOSING TO
SOME SLICK OUTSIDER?

291
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:49,750
C'MON, GIVE ME A BREAK.

292
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:51,708
- Man 4: HIS OPPONENT'S
AN EIGHT-SIX RIGHT?

293
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:53,166
- Man 3: AN FD IS A
TOUGH OPPONENT,

294
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,500
BUT AN EIGHT-SIX IS JUST
FLAT OUT OLD.

295
00:17:57,916 --> 00:18:00,000
- THE OTHER TEAM WANTS TO
DO THE DOWNHILL FIRST.

296
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:02,250
I FIGURE THAT WORKS FINE FOR US.

297
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:04,291
AND IT'S NOT GONNA BE A
SIDE-BY-SIDE START.

298
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:07,041
IT'LL START WITH A CHASE,
ONE CAR CHASING THE OTHER.

299
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:09,500
THEY'LL GO FIRST.
NOW, I'M SURE YOU KNOW THIS.

300
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:11,333
BUT IF HE PULLS AWAY FROM YOU,
WE LOSE THE RACE.

301
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:13,791
TRY NOT TO FORGET THAT
WHEN YOU'RE OUT THERE?

302
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:19,041
- IT'S READY.
YOU CAN START ANYTIME.

303
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:27,458
- YOU MIGHT JUST THINK IT'S
ANOTHER EIGHT-SIX, TOHRU,

304
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:30,625
BUT I PROMISE YOU, THERE'S
NOTHING NORMAL ABOUT THIS CAR.

305
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:32,083
- OF COURSE, I KNOW THAT.

306
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:36,041
BUT I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO CONTROL
OVER WHAT HE'S DRIVING.

307
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:39,583
THE BEST I CAN DO IS TO JUST
GET OUT THERE AND RACE.

308
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:41,916
- HEY, TOHRU.

309
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,041
- SHINICHI, GIVE ME YOUR HAND.

310
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:45,166
- HUH?

311
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:51,000
- CAN YOU FEEL THAT?
I'M SHAKING.

312
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:54,041
I'M SO SCARED.

313
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:55,916
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,
ALL I WANT TO DO RIGHT NOW

314
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,875
IS JUST RUN AWAY FROM HERE.

315
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:01,583
I KNOW THIS IS WEIRD, BUT AT
THE SAME TIME, I'M HAPPY.

316
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:04,666
I FEEL LIKE I CAN HARDLY
CONTROL MYSELF.

317
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,416
AND DO YOU KNOW WHY THAT IS?

318
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:10,833
IT'S BECAUSE OF PROJECT D.

319
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,958
I'VE BEEN DRIVING A LONG TIME,

320
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:14,833
AND IT'S A RARE THING TO HAVE
THE OPPORTUNITY TO RACE

321
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:17,500
UNDER PRESSURE LIKE THIS.

322
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:19,083
TONIGHT'S BATTLE,

323
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:23,791
IT'S GONNA BE THE MOST IMPORTANT
EVENT OF MY ENTIRE LIFE.

324
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:26,666
I'M THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE
SEVEN STAR LEAF OUT THERE.

325
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:29,250
TONIGHT MY DRIVING WILL
MAKE YOU ALL PROUD.

326
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:31,541
NO REGRETS LEFT BEHIND.

327
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:34,625
- THAT'S HOW YOU'RE GONNA
WIN THIS. NOW, DO IT.

328
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:37,916
- ALRIGHT. THIS IS IT, GUYS.
LET'S MOVE OUT.

329
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:41,083
- ( engine revving )

330
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:47,916
- I'M TOHRU SUETSUGU.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

331
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:50,625
- TAKUMI FUJIWARA.

332
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,791
- WHAT'S THIS FEELING?

333
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:02,791
I'VE NEVER FELT LIKE THIS
BEFORE. LIKE I'M NUMB.

334
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:04,041
PINS AND NEEDLES.

335
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:06,833
I'M SO NUMB I'M ALMOST
CRAWLING OUT OF MY SKIN!

336
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:14,666
NAO, YOU'RE GONNA TAKE CARE OF
ME ON THOSE ROADS, RIGHT?

337
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:17,666
- ( engines revving )

338
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,500
- ( tires screeching )

339
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:45,708
- YOU PROBABLY DON'T KNOW
THIS, TOHRU,

340
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:48,625
BUT YOU'RE THE REASON
I JOINED THIS TEAM.

341
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:52,166
YOU'RE THE BEST. THE DAREDEVIL
"KAMIKAZE DOWNHILLER".

342
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,666
THERE'S NOT A SINGLE
PERSON ALIVE

343
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,416
WHO COULD KEEP UP WITH YOU
ON THE DOWNHILL.

344
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,333
NOT NOW NOT EVER.

345
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:04,666
LOSING TO SOME
OUTSIDER EIGHT-SIX?

346
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,750
( scoffs ) AIN'T EVEN ON
THE BOOKS TONIGHT.

347
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:15,458
- I MADE THE RIGHT DECISION
IN CHOOSING TO LEAD.

348
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:18,541
YOU LOSE THAT RHYTHM ON THE
DOWNHILL, AND IT'LL KILL YA.

349
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:21,333
I WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST GUY
CARRIED OFF THIS MOUNTAIN.

350
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:26,333
- ( tires screeching )

351
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:31,875
- CALM DOWN. THIS ISN'T ABOUT
WINNING OR LOSING.

352
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:34,625
THIS IS ALL ABOUT MAXING
OUT MY FULL POTENTIAL.

353
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:45,250
- Ryosuke: WHEN YOU GET
RIGHT DOWN TO IT,

354
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:49,000
THE ROADSTER IS A MORE COMPACT
VEHICLE THAN THE EIGHT-SIX.

355
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:50,708
AND BECAUSE OF ITS
SMALLER SIZE...

356
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:51,958
YOU CAN BET THAT
THEIR MAIN WEAPON

357
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:53,958
WILL BE TECHNICAL FOOTWORK.

358
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:58,250
WHAT I'VE SEEN SO FAR TELLS ME

359
00:21:58,333 --> 00:22:01,000
THIS GUY TOHRU'S
DRIVING IS ROUGH.

360
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:03,500
HE'S RELYING ON LEADING INTO
THE CORNERS AT HIGH SPEED.

361
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:06,750
IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S BAD FORM,
JUST KINDA ROOKIE IF YOU ASK ME.

362
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,166
THIS'LL PUSH HIS CAR
THROUGH EVERY CORNER,

363
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:12,208
BY USING AN INERTIAL DRIFT.

364
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:18,375
DON'T GET ME WRONG.

365
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:19,916
I UNDERSTAND THAT EVERY
DRIVING STYLE STARTS

366
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,791
WITH THE CONCEPT OF GOING INTO A
CORNER AS FAST AS POSSIBLE.

367
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:26,125
I JUST THINK THAT YOU COULD SAY
THAT HIS DRIVING TECHNIQUE WAS

368
00:22:26,208 --> 00:22:29,041
ALMOST NURTURED BY HIS
UNDERPOWERED ROADSTER.

369
00:22:29,125 --> 00:22:31,791
- SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT
HE'S JUST LIKE FUJIWARA?

370
00:22:31,875 --> 00:22:33,500
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

371
00:22:33,583 --> 00:22:35,791
IT'S VERY SIMILAR TO THE
RELATIONSHIP TAKUMI HAS

372
00:22:35,875 --> 00:22:37,375
WITH HIS EIGHT-SIX.

373
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:42,541
WITH ONE EXCEPTION...

374
00:22:42,625 --> 00:22:44,583
- YAHOO! ALRIGHT!

375
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:48,875
- THE BIG HIGHLIGHT OF THIS
COURSE IS THE STRETCH AT THE END

376
00:22:48,958 --> 00:22:51,750
WHERE THERE ARE NO COVERS
OVER THE GUTTERS.

377
00:22:51,833 --> 00:22:54,833
AND WHAT THE DRIVERS PULL OFF
AT THAT MOMENT

378
00:22:54,916 --> 00:22:56,291
WILL MAKE THIS RACE.

379
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,333
YEAH BUT I WONDER,
IS THERE ANY WAY FOR A DRIVER

380
00:22:58,416 --> 00:22:59,750
TO GET ACROSS THOSE PITS

381
00:22:59,833 --> 00:23:02,208
WITHOUT JUST TRYING TO
AVOID THEM ALL TOGETHER?

382
00:23:02,291 --> 00:23:04,125
THERE'S GOTTA BE
ANOTHER METHOD.

383
00:23:04,208 --> 00:23:05,416
- YEAH. THERE IS.

384
00:23:07,541 --> 00:23:09,750
I ALREADY TOLD TAKUMI ABOUT IT.

385
00:23:11,625 --> 00:23:14,041
IT'S AN INCREDIBLY
DANGEROUS TECHNIQUE.

386
00:23:14,125 --> 00:23:17,333
IT RELIES ON SHIFTING
THE CAR'S WEIGHT.

387
00:23:17,416 --> 00:23:20,416
BUT IT'S NOTHING TAKUMI
AND KEISUKE CAN'T HANDLE.

388
00:23:23,791 --> 00:23:25,375
I MEAN, HEY,

389
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,875
THEY ARE MY DOUBLE ACES.

390
00:23:28,958 --> 00:23:30,916
- ( fast-paced song playing )

391
00:23:32,916 --> 00:23:36,000
- WHOA, CHECK, THAT OUT! THAT
TURN HE JUST MADE IS INSANE.

392
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:39,333
TOHRU'S NOT GOING EASY TONIGHT!

393
00:23:39,416 --> 00:23:41,416
BUT THEN AGAIN, LOOKS
LIKE THAT EIGHT-SIX

394
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,666
ISN'T FALLING TOO FAR BEHIND
EITHER, IS IT DUDE?

395
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:47,541
- HE WON'T LAST, THOUGH.

396
00:23:47,625 --> 00:23:49,333
NOBODY CAN KEEP UP WITH TOHRU.

397
00:23:49,416 --> 00:23:51,416
THAT GUY LEAVES
EVERYONE IN THE DUST.

398
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:54,083
- YEAH. THEN THERE'S ONLY
ONE QUESTION, RIGHT?

399
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:56,041
HOW LONG CAN THE
EIGHT-SIX KEEP UP?

400
00:23:56,125 --> 00:23:58,583
- I BET HE'S OUT WAY BEFORE
THIS THING'S EVEN OVER.

401
00:24:01,458 --> 00:24:03,750
- I GUESS I SHOULD START
BEING IMPRESSED.

402
00:24:03,833 --> 00:24:07,125
NOBODY'S EVER BEEN ABLE TO STAY
SO CLOSE TO ME FOR THIS LONG.

403
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,833
ONE THING'S FOR SURE, THAT'S
NO NORMAL JUNKER EIGHT-SIX.

404
00:24:12,916 --> 00:24:15,291
BUT EVEN MORE IMPORTANT
THAN THAT,

405
00:24:15,375 --> 00:24:18,041
WHO THE HECK IS THE GUY
BEHIND THE WHEEL?

406
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:19,625
- YEAH, HE'S GOOD.

407
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:22,750
BUT IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE
I'M REALLY BEING PUSHED.

408
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,541
- I THINK THIS DUDE'S GOT
HIS HANDS FULL

409
00:24:28,625 --> 00:24:30,708
JUST KEEPING UP WITH ME.

410
00:24:36,458 --> 00:24:38,791
I CAN WIN THIS! I KNOW IT!

411
00:24:41,083 --> 00:24:43,625
I'M NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT
HAPPENS WHEN YOU PUSH TOO HARD

412
00:24:43,708 --> 00:24:45,125
TRYING TO KEEP UP.

413
00:24:45,208 --> 00:24:48,208
IF YOU VALUE YOUR LIFE, THEN YOU
SHOULD GIVE UP RIGHT NOW.

414
00:24:49,625 --> 00:24:52,333
- HIS CORNERING IS INCREDIBLE,
BUT HE'S RECKLESS.

415
00:24:59,375 --> 00:25:02,500
- RYOSUKE, THERE'S STILL
NO REAL DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM.

416
00:25:03,333 --> 00:25:04,583
- SOUNDS RIGHT.

417
00:25:05,958 --> 00:25:08,125
BECAUSE THIS IS WHERE IT BEGINS.

418
00:25:08,208 --> 00:25:10,375
THE FASTEST DOWNHILL RACER
IN GUNMA

419
00:25:13,291 --> 00:25:14,875
IS ABOUT TO SHOW HIS TEETH.
