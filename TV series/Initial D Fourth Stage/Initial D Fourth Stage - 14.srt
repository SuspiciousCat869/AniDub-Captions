HEY, YOU GOT THAT?

18

COLOR EVEN THE REAR WING...

- ( tires screeching )

20

- THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED
THAT NIGHT.

21
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:03,375
OH, OF COURSE IT ALL MAKES
TOTAL SENSE NOW,

22
00:03:03,458 --> 00:03:06,000
I'M SO BLIND WHY DIDN'T
I PUT IT TOGETHER SOONER?

23
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:09,083
DAMN IT, I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN.

24
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:11,750
THERE'S ONLY ONE PERSON ALIVE
WHO DRIVES SO DANGEROUSLY,

25
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:15,250
SO RECKLESSLY, SO STUPID FAST
ON AKINA'S DOWNHILL.

26
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:17,458
THAT WAS YOU OUT THERE,
WASN'T IT, DAD?

27
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:55,833
- IT'S A DAMN SHAME,

28
00:03:55,916 --> 00:04:00,458
BUT THE KID'S GONNA DROP INTO A
SLUMP FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

29
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:02,916
STILL, HE'S GOT NO FUTURE
IF HE CAN'T GET PAST

30
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,500
DRIVING THE EIGHT-SIX.

31
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:07,625
IF YOU DON'T SPREAD YOUR
WINGS, YOU HIT THE GROUND.

32
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:26,708
- THIS IS WILD.

33
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:34,083
DAMN THAT OLD GEEZER.

34
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:37,458
HOW COULD HE SAY THAT THIS CAR
IS PRACTICAL AND EASY TO DRIVE?

35
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:41,500
MUST BE DOING THIS TO MESS
WITH ME OR SOMETHING.

36
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:43,583
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TO
DO WITH THIS THING.

37
00:04:56,875 --> 00:04:58,666
- YOU SAID IT WAS A CAPPUCCINO?

38
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,458
YELLOW LICENSE PLATE
AND EVERYTHING?

39
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:03,208
- YEAH. SURPRISED US TOO, BOSS.

40
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:04,791
- BUT YOU GOTTA ADMIT,

41
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:06,666
THEIR OPPONENTS SURE DO COME UP
WITH SOME INTERESTING TACTICS

42
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,750
WHEN THEY HAVE TO. IT IS
ACTUALLY A PRETTY GOOD IDEA.

43
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,791
I MEAN THOSE K VEHICLES
ARE SOME FAST CARS

44
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:13,083
WHEN IT COMES TO DOWNHILLS.

45
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:14,208
I WOULDN'T LIE ABOUT THAT.

46
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:15,541
- NOT LIKE IT MATTERED.

47
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:18,458
TAKUMI STILL WON THE NIGHT,
ONE SWEET VICTORY.

48
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:21,125
YOU KNOW, I WONDER IF THERE'S
A DRIVER OUT THERE

49
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:22,583
WHO COULD EVER BEAT HIM.

50
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:25,500
- KEEP AN OPEN MIND. THERE'S
AN ENTIRE WORLD OUT THERE.

51
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:27,000
NO MATTER HOW GOOD YOU GET,

52
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:29,541
THERE'S ALWAYS SOMEONE WHO CAN
KNOCK YOU OFF YOUR THRONE.

53
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:31,041
- YEAH, BUT, BOSS,

54
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:33,208
TAKUMI'S DRIVING IS BETTER
THAN YOU'D THINK.

55
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,458
GETTING TO WHERE IT'S
ALMOST UNREAL. RIGHT?

56
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:38,250
- YOU'RE NOT LYING ABOUT THAT.
TAKUMI'S SKILL BEHIND THE WHEEL

57
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:40,583
HAS GONE THROUGH THE ROOF
SINCE HE'S JOINED THE D.

58
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:42,125
STILL I MISS THE OLD TAKUMI.

59
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:45,125
ALWAYS SPITTING OUT THE MOST
RIDICULOUS NONSENSE ABOUT CARS.

60
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:47,375
- GOTTA SAY, LAST NIGHT
IT WAS A LONELY FEELING

61
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:48,375
WATCHING HIM CHAT IT UP

62
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:50,291
WITH RYOSUKE FROM A DISTANCE.

63
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:52,750
NOT THAT I WAS JEALOUS
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

64
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:55,583
IT'S JUST THAT I FELT MORE
LIKE A FAN THAN A FRIEND.

65
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:58,083
THE GUY'S JUST GOTTEN
TO BE SO DISTANT FROM US.

66
00:05:58,166 --> 00:06:02,333
- HUH, I THINK THAT'S JUST ALL
IN YOUR FOGGY TEENAGE BRAINS.

67
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:05,458
I'VE SEEN TAKUMI AROUND YOU GUYS
AND HE SEEMS THE SAME TO ME.

68
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:07,083
- ( car approaching )

69
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,708
- WELL, SPEAK OF THE DEVIL.

70
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:14,416
- Kenji: AND THE
DEVIL APPEARS, HUH?

71
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,916
SEE EVEN HIS TIMING HAS
GOTTEN BETTER.

72
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:22,666
- ON YOUR WAY BACK FROM WORK?

73
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,083
- ITSUKI HAD THE
EARLY SHIFT TODAY,

74
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:25,291
SO HE'S ALL READY GONE HOME.

75
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:27,375
- NO, I'M NOT HERE TO SEE HIM.

76
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:29,125
I JUST HAD A QUICK
QUESTION FOR YOU.

77
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:30,875
DID MY DAD HAPPEN TO
SAY ANYTHING TO YOU

78
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:32,666
ABOUT HIM BUYING A NEW CAR?

79
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,958
- YEAH, SURE.
IT'S THAT NEW IMPREZA.

80
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:37,500
- OH, GREAT.
SO, YOU KNEW ALL ABOUT IT.

81
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:39,708
- DUDE.
- AN IMPREZA, HUH?

82
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:41,000
- YOU KNOW WHAT,

83
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:43,125
THAT OLD MAN CAN REALLY PISS
ME OFF SOMETIMES.

84
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:45,000
HE'LL TELL ALL HIS BUDDIES
BUT I'VE GOT TO BE

85
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:46,166
THE LAST ONE TO KNOW.

86
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,458
- WELL, YOU GIVE
THE NEW WHEELS A SPIN?

87
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,000
- YEA, FIRST THING THIS MORNING.

88
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:51,416
- AND WHAT'D YOU THINK?

89
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,375
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT
I THINK ABOUT IT YET.

90
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:54,916
IT ALMOST MORE LIKE
BEING BEHIND A WHEEL

91
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,708
OF A FLYING SAUCER THAN A CAR.

92
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,708
- DUDE, YOU SOUND CRAZY AS HELL.

93
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:00,750
- YEAH, I DON'T GET
WHAT YOUR PROBLEM IS, MAN.

94
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:03,291
- DRIVING IT HAS JUST BEEN
TOO JARRING FOR ME TO HANDLE.

95
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:06,750
I MEAN, YEAH, I DID IT 'CAUSE
MY DAD WANTED ME TO, BUT NOW...

96
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:08,416
NOW, I'M ALL CONFUSED.

97
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,791
I HONESTLY DON'T EVEN
THINK I EVEN KNOW

98
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:11,791
HOW TO DRIVE
THE EIGHT-SIX ANYMORE.

99
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:13,041
- ( all gasping )

100
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:15,416
- SORRY, BRO, YOU'RE NOT
MAKING ANY SENSE AT ALL.

101
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,625
I MEAN IF I'D EVER SEEN
YOU LOSE IN THAT CAR,

102
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:19,541
I MIGHT SEE WHAT YOU'RE GETTING
AT, BUT RIGHT NOW...

103
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:21,041
- DAMN RIGHT.

104
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:23,291
- OKAY, MAYBE I'M JUST NOT
EXPLAINING MYSELF WELL ENOUGH.

105
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:25,625
IT'S NOT THAT I'VE
FORGOTTEN HOW TO DRIVE IT.

106
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:28,208
IT'S THAT I'M LOSING
CONFIDENCE IN MY ABILITIES.

107
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:32,875
MY HEAD FEELS LIKE
A JUMBLED MESS RIGHT NOW

108
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:34,708
AND THE PANIC
IS REALLY STARTING TO SET IN.

109
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,625
- I HOPE THE DRIVE WASN'T BAD.

110
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:48,791
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO COME
ALL THE WAY TO SAITAMA.

111
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:51,875
- NAH. THIS PLACE REALLY ISN'T
THAT FAR AWAY FROM SHIBUKAWA.

112
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:52,958
SO, DON'T SWEAT IT.

113
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:54,291
AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT,

114
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:56,083
SAITAMA AND GUNMA ARE RIGHT
NEXT TO EACH OTHER,

115
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:57,416
SO, IT'S COOL.

116
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,583
IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE IT
WHEN YOU'RE ON THE TRAINS.

117
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:00,458
BUT IF YOU'RE IN A
CAR, IT'S PRETTY CLOSE.

118
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:02,708
- I GUESS. I'M JUST GLAD
YOU'RE HERE.

119
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:04,000
- YOU CAN CALL ME ANYTIME,

120
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:05,750
SAY THE WORD AND I'LL
COME RIGHT BACK OUT.

121
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:07,125
I'M USUALLY NOT
DOING ANYTHING,

122
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:09,000
SO VISITING YOU IS JUST
A BIG BRIGHT SPOT

123
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:10,916
IN OTHERWISE BORING DAY.

124
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,083
- YOU DON'T HAVE A GIRLFRIEND?
I FIGURED YOU WOULD.

125
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:15,416
- 'COURSE, I DON'T.
YOU KNOW ME, RIGHT?

126
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,000
( laughs )

127
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:32,333
- SO... UH... WHAT ABOUT YOU?
- HUH?

128
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:34,416
- YOU GOT YOURSELF
A BOYFRIEND?

129
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,541
- AH...

130
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:39,791
LIKE A STEADY ONE?
NO, I GUESS I DON'T.

131
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:43,500
- ( exclaims ) OH, YEAH?
THAT'S SO AWESOME.

132
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:47,000
AH, I DIDN'T MEAN
IT'S AWESOME THAT YOUR ALONE.

133
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:51,375
I MEAN PLAYING THE SINGLE
SCENE, I GET IT, COOL.

134
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:53,208
- MAYBE YOU HAVEN'T
CHANGED MUCH AFTER ALL.

135
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:54,541
- ( chuckles)

136
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:56,458
SEE I TOLD YOU, MY BUDDIES
ARE ALWAYS TELLING ME

137
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:59,208
HOW THEY THINK
I'M NEVER GONNA GROW UP.

138
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:01,708
- I DON'T MEAN IT LIKE THAT.
I MEAN YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN

139
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,666
THE KIND OF PERSON WHO
DOESN'T HIDE YOUR FEELINGS,

140
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,291
AND I STILL SEE THAT IN YOU.

141
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:06,666
- YEAH, THEY SAY THAT, TOO.

142
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,625
THAT YOU CAN TELL EVERYTHING
FROM MY BIG DUMB FACE.

143
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:11,250
- I LIKE YOUR FACE AND I THINK
THAT'S A GOOD THING.

144
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:13,416
I CAN TELL THAT YOU'RE NOT
HIDING ANYTHING FROM ME.

145
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,500
REALLY PUTS ME AT EASE.

146
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:16,791
YOU'RE LIKE AN OLD COMFY CHAIR.

147
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:18,208
- WELL, THANKS.

148
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:21,166
I GUESS THERE'S NOT REALLY TOO
MUCH I CAN DO ABOUT IT.

149
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,833
MAYBE GET A FACE TRANSPLANT.

150
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:24,291
( laughs )

151
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:27,583
- THANK YOU FOR YOUR BUSINESS!

152
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:30,666
- ( sighs )

153
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:33,625
OKAY, WORK STUFF ASIDE,
I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND.

154
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:35,875
TAKUMI'S THE MOST
SKILLED DRIVER I KNOW.

155
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:38,083
IT SHOULD BE CAKE FOR HIM
TO MASTER ANY CAR.

156
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:41,291
AN FR, A FOUR-WHEEL DRIVE,
WHATEVER. WHAT'S HIS PROBLEM?

157
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,125
- MAYBE IT'S SOME DRIVER
THING WE CAN'T EVEN

158
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,500
WRAP OUR HEADS AROUND.

159
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:47,291
WE'RE NOT ON THAT LEVEL.
HOW ARE WE SUPPOSE TO KNOW?

160
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:50,125
- WELL, ONE THING'S FOR SURE.

161
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:53,791
BUNTA'S BUMPED TAKUMI'S
TRAINING UP A PRETTY BIG NOTCH.

162
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:55,583
I JUST HOPE HE KNOWS
WHAT HE'S DOING.

163
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:03,041
- SO, KAZUMI, I WAS THINKING
WE COULD HEAD ON UP

164
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:04,375
TO THAT MOUNTAIN PASS

165
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:06,250
THAT TAKUMI AND WATARU
RACED ON THE OTHER NIGHT.

166
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:08,625
I WANNA GIVE THAT SUCKER A
RUN WITH MY OWN SET OF WHEELS,

167
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,375
SEE WHAT KINDA DAMAGE
I CAN DO.

168
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:12,750
- YEAH, SURE. BUT THAT'S
A WAY DIFFICULT COURSE.

169
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:14,250
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

170
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:16,416
- YEP. IT'LL TAKE A REAL MAN
TO GO UP AGAINST IT'S CURVES

171
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,166
AND STRAIGHTEN 'EM OUT.

172
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:27,458
- ( tires screeching )

173
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:28,791
- ( exclaims )

174
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:30,708
EITHER I'M TOO BUSY TRYING
TO WORK OUT THE STEERING

175
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:31,958
OR I CAN'T SEEM TO FIGURE OUT

176
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:33,708
WHERE THE LINE
IS ON THIS ROAD.

177
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:39,250
- WHOA. JUST WHAT I'D EXPECT
FROM A TURBO TUNED CAR.

178
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:43,041
- ( gasps )

179
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:48,041
- ( tires screeching )

180
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:54,708
- A LAGGY TURBO. REMINDS
ME OF THE OLD DAYS

181
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:57,250
OF RIDING SHOTGUN IN MY
BROTHER'S LEVIN.

182
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:03,791
- MAN, IT IS A HARD RUN.

183
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:06,000
A LOT HARDER THAN WHAT
WE GOT BACK IN AKINA.

184
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,666
I'M NOT IN MY GROOVE HERE.

185
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,583
- SAY WHAT YOU WANT, BUT
YOU'VE GOTTEN A LOT BETTER

186
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:11,000
SINCE THE LAST TIME I SAW YOU.

187
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:13,291
I FEEL SO COMFORTABLE
WITH YOU DRIVING ME AROUND.

188
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:15,125
- ( chuckles ) ALL RIGHT.

189
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:17,666
MIGHT NOT LOOK LIKE IT, BUT I'VE
BEEN PRACTICING MY TAIL OFF.

190
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,875
WITH A FINICKY TURBO LIKE MINE,
IF YOU DON'T PRACTICE,

191
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:21,958
YOU MIGHT AS WELL
TRADE HER IN FOR A TRUCK.

192
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:38,416
- ( tires screeching )

193
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:56,250
- CRAP. WHY CAN'T I DO THIS?

194
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:12,000
- Bunta: OH, YEAH, TAKUMI REALLY
SAID THAT, HUH? WELL, NO SHIT.

195
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:13,958
- Yuichi: IS THAT ALL
YOU GOTTA SAY?

196
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:16,958
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO THIS
TIME, BUNTA? I'M CURIOUS.

197
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:18,708
- IT'LL TAKE TOO
LONG TO EXPLAIN,

198
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:20,583
SO I WON'T GO INTO DETAILS.

199
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:23,625
BASICALLY, I JUST WANT THE KID
TO EXPERIENCE THE POTENTIAL

200
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:26,791
NEW CARS HAVE THESE DAYS.
HE NEEDS TO STAY UP ON IT.

201
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:28,833
- I GUESS I FAILED TO SEE
THE POINT IN THAT.

202
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:31,375
THE KID'S BEEN RACING PLENTY
OF NEWER CARS TILL NOW.

203
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:33,458
HE SEEMS TO BE DOING FINE TO ME.

204
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:35,708
- NAH, I DON'T THINK
HE REALLY GETS IT.

205
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:38,125
HIS TECHNIQUE IS BASED
COMPLETELY ON THE EIGHT-SIX.

206
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:39,625
THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN HIS GAME.

207
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:43,958
YOU SAID HE WAS GOING
ON ABOUT NOT KNOWING

208
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:45,708
HOW TO DRIVE THE EIGHT-SIX.

209
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:48,458
BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT'S KNOCKING
AROUND IN THAT SKULL OF HIS.

210
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:49,708
- THEN WHAT'S THE ISSUE?

211
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:53,500
- HE'S JUST DISHING THAT
STUFF OUT AS AN EXCUSE.

212
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:54,833
THE TRUTH IS,

213
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:56,291
HE KNOWS HE'S ABOUT TO GIVE UP
ON THE EIGHT-SIX,

214
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:59,416
AND HE DOESN'T WANT TO FACE
THE MUSIC LIKE A BIG BOY.

215
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,666
STILL IT'S JUST WHAT
I EXPECTED HIM TO DO.

216
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,750
- YOU'RE NOT THINKING OF
HAVING TAKUMI SWITCH CARS

217
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:04,750
OVER TO THE IMPREZA?

218
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:06,333
THAT'S NOT HIS STYLE.

219
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:10,708
- I WOULDN'T DO THAT. THE
IMPREZA'S MY CAR. I BOUGHT IT.

220
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:13,416
IT'LL TAKE TIME, BUT HE
NEEDS TO JUMP THIS HURDLE.

221
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,375
IF HE CAN'T, HE'LL NEVER BE THE
KIND OF DRIVER HE WANTS TO BE.

222
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:31,416
- I WONDER WHAT NATSUKI'S
UP TO THESE DAYS.

223
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,000
HAVEN'T TALKED TO
HER IN A WHILE.

224
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:37,666
BUT IF I KNOW HER,
SHE NEVER GETS LONELY.

225
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,916
I'VE BEEN GOING FULL TILT,
NO TIME FOR ANYTHING

226
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,208
BUT FOR WHAT I GOT GOING ON
WITH D THAT WEEK.

227
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:44,833
BUT, IT JUST FEELS OUT OF WHACK.

228
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:47,791
MAYBE IT'S ME. MAYBE I'M THE
ONE WHO'S OUT OF IT LATELY.

229
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:49,833
I JUST CAN'T KEEP
MY MIND OFF THAT GIRL.

230
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:52,583
WHY AM I SO LONELY?

231
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:14,375
THE RIDE'S REALLY NOT ALL
THAT DIFFERENT

232
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:16,375
FROM UP THROUGH THIS POINT
IN THE COURSE.

233
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:20,666
BUT FROM HERE ON OUT,
EVERYTHING IS.

234
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:26,208
I GOTTA ADMIT THIS IS KILLER.

235
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:30,708
THE STABILITY IS ROCK SOLID
EVEN IN THIS RAIN. IT'S BADASS.

236
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,291
- MY COUSIN IN HIGASHI-MATSUYAMA

237
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:44,166
DRIVES A SILVER ALTEZZA.
IT'S A SWEET RIDE.

238
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,833
ANYWAY, HE LET ME
DRIVE IT ONE TIME,

239
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:47,625
AND THAT WAS ONE HELL OF A CAR.

240
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:49,041
- HMM-MM.

241
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:52,583
ALTEZZA'S ARE NICE. NOT MY
FAVORITE, BUT PRETTY COOL.

242
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:54,125
- ( cellphone vibrating )

243
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:56,791
- WHAT? YOU'RE NOT ANSWERING?

244
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:58,291
- I'M GONNA LET THAT ONE
GO TO VOICEMAIL.

245
00:14:58,375 --> 00:14:59,958
IT'S REALLY NOT THAT IMPORTANT.

246
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:01,875
- COOL.

247
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:05,333
SHE MUST NOT WANT ANYONE
INTERRUPTING OUR SWEET DATE.

248
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:08,166
- Man: HURRY UP!

249
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,666
HOW LONG YOU GONNA MAKE ME WAIT,
YOU FREAKING DUMBASS?

250
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,958
C'MON, I DON'T HAVE ALL DAY!

251
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:15,916
- I'M VERY SORRY ABOUT
KEEPING YOU WAITING, SIR.

252
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,666
WILL THIS ALL BE ON ONE CHECK?

253
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,250
- HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO
TELL YOU SEPARATE CHECKS?

254
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:32,916
- NICE. THEY'RE DRIVING LANCER
EVOLUTIONS, CHECK IT OUT.

255
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,625
- HEY, I GOT AN IDEA. IF I
PROMISE TO BE REALLY CAREFUL,

256
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:38,916
DO YOU THINK I CAN DRIVE
YOUR LEVIN TONIGHT?

257
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,916
I'M A DRIVER ON PAPER, BUT
I HAVEN'T GOTTEN BEHIND

258
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,791
 A WHEEL IN FOREVER
AND IF I DON'T PRACTICE SOON,

259
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:44,875
I'M GONNA TOTALLY FORGET HOW.

260
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:47,541
- WELL, YEAH. SURE.
OF COURSE, YOU CAN!

261
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:49,541
I'LL COACH YOU THROUGH IT!

262
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:52,250
- ( thunder rumbling )

263
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:57,250
- ( tires screeching )

264
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:03,208
- THERE'S GOT TO BE AWAY
I CAN BEAT THAT IMPREZA

265
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:04,583
WITH THE EIGHT-SIX.

266
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:05,833
BUT WHAT IS IT?

267
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:11,833
- ( engine revving )

268
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:14,333
- THE MORE I DRIVE,
THE MORE CONFUSED I GET.

269
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:22,125
- ( tires screeching )

270
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:27,666
- MAN, I CAN'T EVEN
REMEMBER THE LAST TIME

271
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:28,875
I SPUN OUT LIKE THAT.

272
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:30,666
DAMN IT, WHAT THE HELL
IS WRONG WITH ME?

273
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:37,916
I COULD RUN THIS OVER
MY HEAD A MILLION TIMES

274
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,083
AND I STILL WOULDN'T KNOW

275
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:40,958
HOW TO PASS THE IMPREZA
IN THE EIGHT-SIX.

276
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,291
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

277
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,541
I THOUGHT I'VE PUSHED THIS BABY
TO HER LIMITS. MAYBE I HAVE.

278
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:57,583
BUT I'M GONNA HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO PUSH HER EVEN FURTHER.

279
00:16:57,666 --> 00:17:00,208
I DON'T KNOW HOW, BUT IF
I WANT TO KEEP RACING,

280
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:02,583
I DON'T HAVE A WHOLE
LOT OF CHOICE.

281
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:05,041
AND IF I CAN'T DO
SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS THAT,

282
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:07,458
I DON'T DESERVE TO BE
A DRIVER WITH PROJECT D.

283
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:20,833
- HMM? IF YOU ARE LOOKING
FOR KAZUMI,

284
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:23,208
I THINK SHE'S HANGING OUT
WITH HER FRIEND OF HERS.

285
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:27,875
- OH. YOU GOT ANY PROBLEM IF I
JUST WAIT AROUND HERE FOR HER?

286
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:30,208
I GOT SOME THINGS I HAVE TO SAY.

287
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:32,666
IF I DON'T, I THINK
I MIGHT REGRET IT

288
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,625
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

289
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:42,250
- ( cellphone vibrating )

290
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:46,000
- MY BROTHER CALLING.
HEY, WHAT'S UP?

291
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:48,583
- ( gasps )

292
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:54,625
- WELL, I DON'T CARE WHAT HE
SAID TO YOU. SAY I'M BUSY.

293
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:55,916
SEND HIM HOME, WATARU.

294
00:17:57,291 --> 00:18:00,958
I DON'T CARE.
I'M HANGING UP, BYE.

295
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:03,666
- WHAT'S THE DEAL? YOU GOT
SOME PROBLEMS BACK HOME?

296
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,333
- NO. IT'S JUST MY IDIOT
BROTHER BEING DUMB.

297
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:07,958
- ( chuckles ) GOTCHA.

298
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:21,500
- THIS IS SUCH CRAP, MAN.
ITSUKI'S, OF ALL PEOPLE,

299
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:23,041
IS OUT ON AN ALL DAY DATE

300
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:26,125
AND HERE I AM DRIVING AROUND
WITH YOU ON A SATURDAY NIGHT.

301
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:28,541
- YOU TOOK THE WORDS RIGHT
OUT OF MY MOUTH, BUDDY.

302
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:30,875
- LOOK!
- WHOA, WHAT IS IT, A COP?

303
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:32,458
- BACK THERE AT THAT
CONVENIENCE STORE.

304
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:34,708
LOOKED A LOT LIKE ITSUKI'S
LEVIN PARKED IN THE LOT.

305
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:37,500
- EH, SO, HE DECIDED TO
BRING HIS DATE UP HERE

306
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:38,291
FOR SOME ROMANCE.

307
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:39,541
WELL...

308
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:45,125
- SOMETHING SEEMS OFF
ABOUT THIS.

309
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:48,250
- AWKWARD, RIGHT? WEIRD.

310
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:49,708
- IF YOU'RE READY TO
HEAD ON BACK HOME,

311
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:51,833
I'LL BE HAPPY TO TAKE YOU.

312
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:58,333
- ITSUKI, WHAT IF I DIDN'T
WANT TO GO HOME TONIGHT?

313
00:18:58,416 --> 00:18:59,375
- ( both gasps )

314
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:04,541
- DUDE, DID YOU HEAR
WHAT SHE JUST SAID TO HIM?

315
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:07,916
- THE WORDS ANY MAN WOULD
DREAM OF HEARING JUST ONCE

316
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,833
IN HIS LONELY LIFE.

317
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:11,791
- HOLD UP, MAN,
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

318
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:16,791
- WAIT, IF SHE DOESN'T WANT TO
GO HOME THAT COULD ONLY MEAN...

319
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:19,916
THAT'S WHY SHE'S SEEMS ALL
FLUSTERED AND SWEATY AND WEIRD.

320
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:29,375
MAYBE WE COULD, I MEAN IF YOU
WANT TO... WHY DON'T WE, UH...

321
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:32,416
WE COULD GO TO A HOTEL.

322
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,916
- ( gasps )

323
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,625
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
HE SAID THAT TO HER.

324
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:37,000
- THERE'S NO WAY THIS WILL WORK.

325
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:38,541
I TELL YA, THIS WHOLE THING
SMELLS LIKE IT'S GONNA

326
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:41,125
BLOW UP ANY SECOND, AND
I DON'T MEAN IN A GOOD WAY.

327
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:42,208
- Kazumi: OKAY.

328
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:44,166
- ( gasps )

329
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:48,916
- DUDE, PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER.

330
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,625
- BUT FIRST...

331
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:52,083
I HAVE SOMETHING
I HAVE TO TELL YOU.

332
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:53,708
I JUST NEED TO MAKE SURE
THAT YOU KNOW

333
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:55,708
WHAT YOU'RE GETTING
INTO WITH ME.

334
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:57,041
THIS IS TOO OPEN.

335
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:59,041
MIND IF WE STEP AROUND THE
CORNER FOR SOME PRIVACY?

336
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:00,166
- YEAH, ALL RIGHT.

337
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,083
- LOOK, I FEEL LIKE I NEED
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.

338
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:09,250
OKAY.

339
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,666
THERE'S THIS GUY
THAT I WAS DATING,

340
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,833
AND WE ONLY BROKE UP
ONLY ABOUT A MONTH AGO.

341
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,625
I STILL... I STILL FEEL
KINDA CONFUSED ABOUT HIM,

342
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:21,750
LIKE MAYBE I NEVER KNEW
HOW I FELT ABOUT THE GUY.

343
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:24,583
BUT I THINK WITH YOU, I GUESS
WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS THAT

344
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:27,291
I ALL READY FEEL SO MUCH CLOSER
TO YOU THAN I EVER WAS WITH HIM,

345
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:29,916
THAT WHEN I'M WITH YOU,
IT'S LIKE HE NEVER EXISTED.

346
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,833
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN
ACCEPT THAT BUT IF YOU CAN...

347
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,958
THEN I'D REALLY LIKE
TO BE WITH YOU.

348
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:42,916
- WHEN YOU SAY DATING,
DOES THAT MEAN THAT YOU

349
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,916
AND THIS GUY WENT TO, UH...

350
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,833
I MEAN... DID YOU AND HIM
GO TO HOTELS TOGETHER...

351
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:49,750
NOT THAT IT'S MY BUSINESS.

352
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:54,958
( screams )

353
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:58,375
SO, WHEN YOU NOD LIKE THAT,

354
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:00,833
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN YOU WENT
HOTELS WITH THIS GUY, LIKE...

355
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:02,333
LIKE WHAT, HOW MANY TIMES?

356
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:05,041
MORE THAN 10? LESS?

357
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:09,958
- WELL, PROBABLY A FEW MORE.

358
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:11,291
- ( screams )

359
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,208
- HANG ON, MAN.

360
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:18,416
IT MIGHT SHOCK YOU AT FIRST
BUT YOU CAN MAKE IT THROUGH,

361
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,333
IT'LL BE WORTH IT.

362
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:22,333
- IT'S NO BIGGIE. IF YOU'VE
CHANGED YOUR MIND

363
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:23,666
ABOUT LIKING ME, I GET IT.

364
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:26,458
- IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.
PROMISE, IT'S REALLY NOT.

365
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:30,208
- ( car approaching )

366
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:33,375
- HEY!

367
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:46,375
- YOU'RE A PAIN
IN THE ASS TO FIND.

368
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:51,416
- HEY, WATARU.

369
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,875
- LET'S GET OUTTA HERE, ITSUKI.

370
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:54,791
THERE'S NO POINT IN US
STICKING AROUND.

371
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:56,708
- KAZUMI, WOULD YOU
WAIT A SECOND?

372
00:21:56,791 --> 00:21:58,250
YOU CAN'T KEEP RUNNING AWAY!

373
00:21:58,333 --> 00:22:00,458
- HOW IS THIS ANY
OF YOUR BUSINESS?

374
00:22:00,541 --> 00:22:03,250
- IT'S MY BUSINESS 'CAUSE I
KNOW YOU BETTER THAT THIS.

375
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:05,041
DON'T YOU THINK YOU
OWE HIM AN EXPLANATION

376
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:07,458
INSTEAD OF LEAVING YOUR
PHONE OFF ALL DAMN DAY?

377
00:22:07,541 --> 00:22:10,875
- KAZUMI, WILL YOU PLEASE HEAR
ME OUT THIS ONE LAST TIME?

378
00:22:10,958 --> 00:22:13,458
- YOU CAN'T SHOW UP OUT OF
NOWHERE AND PULL THIS CRAP.

379
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:15,375
I'M OLD ENOUGH
TO LEAD MY OWN LIFE.

380
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:18,083
- HEAR ME OUT AND
I WILL LEAVE YOU ALONE.

381
00:22:18,166 --> 00:22:19,500
JUST LISTEN.

382
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:22,666
I WANNA TRY THINGS OUT
WITH YOU AGAIN.

383
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,500
AND IF WE'RE GONNA DO THAT
YOU NEED TO KNOW

384
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:27,666
THERE'S A REASON I WAS
ACTING THE WAY I WAS.

385
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:30,500
I JUST DIDN'T HAVE
ANY CONFIDENCE.

386
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:34,916
I MEAN IT'S NOT LIKE I HAVE THE
BEST JOB AND I'M SO MUCH OLDER.

387
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,250
I ASSUMED THAT A BEAUTIFUL
YOUNG GIRL LIKE YOU

388
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:39,208
WITH SO MUCH TO OFFER,

389
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:40,833
THAT YOU'D LOSE
INTEREST IN ME,

390
00:22:40,916 --> 00:22:43,416
MOVE ON TO SOMEONE CLOSER
TO YOUR AGE.

391
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,250
THAT'S WHY I ACTED LIKE
I DIDN'T TAKE IT SERIOUSLY.

392
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:48,458
LIKE I DIDN'T TAKE
YOU SERIOUSLY.

393
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:53,166
BUT THAT'S NOT
HOW I REALLY FEEL.

394
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:55,708
BEING AWAY FROM YOU,
IT'S HELPED ME REALIZE

395
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:56,916
HOW MUCH YOU MEAN TO ME.

396
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,250
IT'S COMPLETELY OPENED MY EYES.

397
00:22:59,333 --> 00:23:02,291
I NEED YOU IN MY LIFE, KAZUMI.

398
00:23:02,375 --> 00:23:04,166
- WHAT'S THIS JACKASS DOING?

399
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:06,541
INTERRUPTING OUR DATE
WITH THIS CRAP.

400
00:23:06,625 --> 00:23:08,625
TOO LATE, PAL, SHE'S
TOTALLY IN LOVE WITH ME

401
00:23:08,708 --> 00:23:10,583
OR DIDN'T YOU NOTICE!

402
00:23:10,666 --> 00:23:13,458
- I'M SORRY ABOUT THIS.

403
00:23:13,541 --> 00:23:15,250
- LISTEN, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT ME.

404
00:23:15,333 --> 00:23:17,375
YOU DO WHATEVER YOU
GOTTA TO DO. I'M COOL.

405
00:23:17,458 --> 00:23:20,375
JUST BE HONEST
WITH YOURSELF, OKAY?

406
00:23:20,458 --> 00:23:22,250
THE ONLY THING YOU
NEED TO DO NOW

407
00:23:22,333 --> 00:23:24,666
IS JUMP INTO THE ARMS
OF THE ONE GUY YOU REALLY LIKE.

408
00:23:26,375 --> 00:23:29,708
- YOU ALWAYS SAY
THE RIGHT THING.

409
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,875
- ( gasps )

410
00:23:39,958 --> 00:23:42,958
- AND IT ALL GOES BOOM.
- MAN, IT SUCKS TO BE HIM.

411
00:24:06,041 --> 00:24:07,500
- THINK WE SHOULD
DO SOMETHING?

412
00:24:07,583 --> 00:24:08,666
- WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSE TO DO?

413
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,208
YOU THINK US JUMPING
OUT AND HUGGING HIM

414
00:24:10,291 --> 00:24:11,875
IS GONNA MAKE
FEEL ANY BETTER?

415
00:24:11,958 --> 00:24:14,791
HAVE A LITTLE MERCY ON THE POOR
GUY. WE'LL JUST BAIL QUIETLY.

416
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:19,708
- ( Itsuki crying )

417
00:24:22,375 --> 00:24:25,041
- OH, ITSUKI,
ARE YOU ACTUALLY CRYING?

418
00:24:25,125 --> 00:24:27,791
I KNOW THAT KINDA PAIN
ALL TOO WELL, MY FRIEND.

419
00:24:28,541 --> 00:24:30,125
- ( crying loudly )

420
00:24:30,666 --> 00:24:32,250
- ( gasps )

421
00:24:38,625 --> 00:24:40,041
- ( exclaims loudly )

422
00:24:56,416 --> 00:24:57,791
- ( tires screeching )

423
00:25:09,916 --> 00:25:12,416
- NO MATTER WHAT I DO,
EVERYTHING JUST SUCKS!

424
00:25:16,875 --> 00:25:20,583
WHAT DO I DO? NONE OF THIS IS
MAKING ANY SENSE TO ME AT ALL!

425
