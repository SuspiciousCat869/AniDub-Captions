11
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:21,291
- I THINK I'M FINALLY
STARTING TO GET

12
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:22,791
WHAT YOU WERE TALKING
ABOUT, DUDE.

13
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:24,708
THAT LITTLE CAR IS A HELL OF
A LOT MEANER THAN SHE LOOKS,

14
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:27,833
THAT'S FOR DAMN SURE. SAKAMOTO'S
TIME ON THIS COURSE IS NUTS.

15
00:02:27,916 --> 00:02:29,500
AND HE'S JUST
SCREWING AROUND.

16
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:30,750
- IT'S LIKE I SAID,

17
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:33,000
OUR ADVANTAGE ISN'T ONE
THEY'LL BE EXPECTING.

18
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:35,375
- YOU MEAN THE CAR'S WEIGHT?
- PRECISELY.

19
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:37,166
THE CONCEPT OF USING
A LIGHTWEIGHT VEHICLE

20
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:38,458
TO ONE'S ADVANTAGE

21
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:40,416
DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE
OCCURRED TO OUR OPPONENTS.

22
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,291
BUT ON A DOWNHILL RUN
LIKE THIS ONE,

23
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:45,125
JUST SUCH A CAR CAN GIVE US
EXACTLY THE EDGE WE NEED.

24
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:47,166
COUPLED WITH THE FACT
WE'LL BE RACING THESE GUYS

25
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,125
ON ONE OF THE TIGHT COURSES
SAITAMA IS INFAMOUS FOR.

26
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,625
AND PROJECT D'S
EIGHT-SIX IS TOAST.

27
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:56,541
BESTED BY A CAPPUCCINO.

28
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,625
- ( tires screeching )

29
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:03,625
- OUR BOY'S CERTAINLY
A HARDCORE RALLYIST.

30
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:05,208
THERE AREN'T MANY
DRIVERS LEFT OUT THERE

31
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:06,750
WHO WOULD DARE TAKE A CORNER

32
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:09,250
AT SPEEDS LIKE HE DOES, LET
ALONE IN A VEHICLE SO COMPACT.

33
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:14,541
THE WHEELBASE IS SHORT.
IT SPINS OUT MUCH EASIER.

34
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:16,625
- Wataru: I WARNED YOU
HE WAS CRAZY.

35
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:18,416
MAKES NO DIFFERENCE TO HIM
WHAT KIND OF RIDE

36
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,541
HE'S BEHIND THE WHEEL OF.

37
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:20,750
IF HE WANTS IT TO DRIFT,

38
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:23,625
THEN BY GOD THE DAMN
THING'S GOING TO DRIFT.

39
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:26,625
IT'S HOW HE WORKS OUT
WHAT LIMITATIONS A NEW CAR HAS.

40
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:28,625
IT'S CRAZY, BUT IT WORKS.

41
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:31,000
IN A WAY, HE AND
THE EIGHT-SIX'S DRIVER

42
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:32,833
ARE LIKE TWO OF A KIND.

43
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:36,083
WOW, JUST THINKING ABOUT IT,

44
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:38,291
IT'S ABOUT DAMN TIME THE
EIGHT-SIX'S WINNING STREAK

45
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:39,583
CAME TO AN END,

46
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:40,916
AND WHO BETTER TO WITNESS IT
IN PERSON THAN US?

47
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,041
- I COULDN'T AGREE
WITH YOU MORE.

48
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:46,458
AND WHO BETTER TO BRING
PROJECT D TO ITS KNEES

49
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:48,958
THAN THE NORTHERN
SAITAMA ALLIANCE?

50
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:07,166
- ALL FINISHED.
- NICE JOB.

51
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:14,291
I GOT TO SAY, IT'S AMAZING
HOW MUCH THIS BABY'S CHANGED

52
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:16,500
SINCE THE TWO OF US
HAVE BEEN SHARING IT.

53
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:19,583
I'M WILLING TO BET THERE ARE AS
MANY MODIFICATIONS I CAN'T SEE.

54
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:21,500
- YOU MIGHT BE
RIGHT ABOUT THAT.

55
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:23,291
THE HEADLIGHTS ARE A LOT
LIGHTER THAN THEY USE TO BE.

56
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:24,750
SO THAT'S DIFFERENT.

57
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:26,916
- SO I'M GUESSING IT'S SAFE
TO ASSUME THAT YOU'VE GONE

58
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,541
FROM HOBBY TO FULL-BLOWN
OBSESSION AT THIS POINT.

59
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:32,875
TAKUMI?

60
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:35,166
- THE EIGHT-SIX IS YOURS
FROM NOW ON.

61
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,708
- WHAT?

62
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:38,875
YOU'RE AN ADULT NOW, A LITTLE
TOO OLD TO BE SHARING A RIDE

63
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:40,625
WITH YOUR DECREPIT FATHER,
DON'T YOU THINK?

64
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:42,625
- YOU'RE KIDDING ME.

65
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:44,875
YOU'RE NOT JUST GIVING ME
THE EIGHT-SIX, ARE YOU?

66
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:46,625
- HERE I THOUGHT YOU'D BE HAPPY.

67
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:49,208
- WELL, OF COURSE I AM.
I'M THRILLED. BUT I MEAN...

68
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:51,500
WHAT'RE YOU GOING TO TOOL
AROUND IN, A WHEEL CHAIR?

69
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,583
- NOT QUITE, I'M IN THE PROCESS
OF BUYING A USED CAR.

70
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:55,833
AN OLDIE, BUT A GOODIE.

71
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:57,750
- SO WHAT KIND OF OLDIE
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?

72
00:04:57,833 --> 00:05:00,541
- YOU KNOW, MORE PRACTICAL,
EASIER TO DRIVE.

73
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:02,291
ONE BETTER SUITED TO MY AGE.

74
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:04,625
- AN OLDIE BUT A GOODIE
THEN, HUH?

75
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:07,083
THE HELL'S GOTTEN INTO HIM?

76
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:09,750
- GO AHEAD AND REGISTER
THE EIGHT-SIX IN YOUR NAME.

77
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:12,125
YOU START PAYING TAXES
ON HER NEXT YEAR.

78
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:13,458
- ALL RIGHT.

79
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:16,083
- WELL, OF COURSE
THAT'S TAKING A LEAP OF FAITH

80
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:18,166
AND ASSUMING SHE'LL STILL BE
RUNNING NEXT YEAR.

81
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,541
- COME ON, WHY WOULD YOU
EVEN SAY SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

82
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:22,375
YOU BET YOUR ASS
SHE'LL BE RUNNING.

83
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:23,833
BELIEVE ME, SHE'LL RUN FOREVER

84
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:25,750
IF I HAVE ANYTHING
TO SAY ABOUT IT.

85
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:27,291
I'M IN LOVE WITH THIS CAR.

86
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:29,000
- WELL, THEN I'M HAPPY
FOR YOU BOTH.

87
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:31,666
YOU CAN TAKE CARE OF HER
ON YOUR OWN FROM NOW ON, TOO.

88
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:43,833
- Fumihiro: THE COURSE
WE'RE SCOUTING OUT TODAY

89
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:45,416
IS ANOTHER TIGHT ONE.

90
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,916
AND IF THAT WEREN'T ENOUGH,
APPARENTLY IT'S GOT STORM DRAINS

91
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,666
- RUNNING ACROSS
BOTH SIDES OF THE ROAD.

92
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:50,833
- THAT'S WHAT I HEAR.

93
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:52,375
- YOU'D THINK THAT AS BIG
AS SAITAMA IS

94
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:54,791
THERE WOULD BE AT LEAST ONE
COURSE THAT WASN'T A DEATH TRAP.

95
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:55,958
- NO KIDDING.

96
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:57,625
- OH, AND BY THE WAY, KEISUKE,

97
00:05:57,708 --> 00:06:00,125
IT'S REALLY NONE OF MY
BUSINESS OR ANYTHING, BUT...

98
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:02,208
- WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND?

99
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:04,375
- WELL, IT'S JUST THAT GIRL
STRIKES ME AS A GREAT CATCH.

100
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:06,833
SHE SEEMED NICE, TOO.

101
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:08,500
I MEAN, YOU DO HAVE TO ADMIT,

102
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:11,333
IT WAS REALLY SWEET OF HER TO
COME ALL THE WAY OUT TO AKAGI.

103
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:12,750
WHAT'S NOT TO LIKE?

104
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:14,625
- THAT'S NOT IT.

105
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:15,958
YEAH, SHE'S COOL,

106
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:17,875
BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER
I LIKE HER OR NOT.

107
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:20,166
WHAT I HAVE TO DO IS
FOCUS ON PROJECT D.

108
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,500
I WAS STRAIGHT WITH HER.

109
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:23,041
SHE KNOWS THE LAST THING I
NEED TO WORRY ABOUT NOW

110
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:24,375
IS SOME CHICK.

111
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,541
- I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND
ME SAYING SO,

112
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:29,791
BUT DON'T YOU THINK YOU
MIGHT BE A LITTLE TOO FOCUSED

113
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:31,166
ON PROJECT D?

114
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:34,166
YOU CAN'T JUST EAT, SLEEP
AND BREATHE IT 24/7.

115
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:37,166
THINK OF IT LIKE DRIVING.

116
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,541
SOMETIMES YOU PICK UP SPEED

117
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:40,541
BY ACTUALLY LETTING OFF THE
ACCELERATOR A LITTLE,

118
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:42,458
INSTEAD OF JUST MASHING PEDAL
TO FLOORBOARD

119
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:44,541
AND WHITE-KNUCKLING
THE STEERING WHEEL, I MEAN.

120
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:47,958
( laughs ) LOOK AT ME,

121
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:49,583
TRYING TO GIVE YOU ROMANTIC
ADVICE BY DRESSING IT UP

122
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:51,708
IN SOME HALF-BAKED
RACING METAPHOR.

123
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:53,541
WHO THE HELL
DO I THINK I AM?

124
00:06:58,125 --> 00:06:59,666
FOR THE RECORD, THOUGH,
I DON'T THINK IT'S HEALTHY

125
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:02,500
FOR ANYONE TO BE
SO SINGLE-MINDED.

126
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:04,875
HEY, JUST THINK OF ALL THE GOOD
TIMES YOU'RE MISSING OUT ON.

127
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:07,000
THAT'S ALL I'M REALLY
TRYING TO SAY HERE.

128
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:09,000
BESIDES, IT DOESN'T TAKE
A GENIUS TO FIGURE OUT

129
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:11,125
THAT GIRL'S ALL THAT'S BEEN
ON YOUR MIND LATELY.

130
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,583
COME ON, MAN,

131
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:16,916
YOU CAN'T THINK THE SAME THING'S
GONNA HAPPEN WITH HER

132
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,250
THAT HAPPENED WITH THE LAST GIRL
YOU WENT OUT WITH.

133
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:21,541
THIS ONE GETS IT.
SHE'S A RACER.

134
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:24,833
- THAT'S NOT THE POINT.
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

135
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:27,916
LET'S JUST CHANGE THE DAMN
SUBJECT, ALL RIGHT, MAN?

136
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:38,666
- Kyoko: NORTHERN
SAITAMA ALLIANCE?

137
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,958
- YEAH. A BUNCH OF US
ARE TRYING TO GET ORGANIZED

138
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:43,333
TO HEDGE OUR BETS
AGAINST PROJECT D.

139
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:46,375
NONE OF US STAND A CHANCE OF
BEATING THOSE GUYS INDIVIDUALLY.

140
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:48,666
SCRAPING TOGETHER LIKE THIS
IS OUR BEST OPTION,

141
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,500
WE DON'T HAVE MUCH CHOICE.

142
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:53,333
SO, BASICALLY, WE'RE PUTTING
TOGETHER A NEW TEAM.

143
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:55,916
IT'LL TEMPORARILY BE
HEADED BY NOBUHIKO.

144
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,416
- IS THAT RIGHT?

145
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,916
- BUT WHAT WE NEED MORE THAN
ANYTHING RIGHT NOW IS MONEY.

146
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,666
SO WE'RE ALL CHIPPING IN, YOU
KNOW, WHATEVER WE'RE ABLE TO.

147
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,958
WOULD YOU CARE TO MAYBE
MAKE A LITTLE DONATION YOURSELF?

148
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:07,000
- YEAH, OKAY, I CAN CHIP IN.

149
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:09,458
WHAT, DO YOU THINK FIVE THOUSAND
YEN WOULD BE ENOUGH?

150
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:11,000
- HEY, KYOKO. GOT A SEC?

151
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:26,041
- ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THIS?
- ABOUT WHAT?

152
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:28,166
- YOU CHIPPING IN
TO HELP BEAT PROJECT D.

153
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:32,916
LOOK, THERE'S NOT REALLY AN EASY
WAY FOR ME TO ASK YOU THIS

154
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,666
SO I'LL JUST COME
RIGHT OUT WITH IT.

155
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,833
WHOSE SIDE
ARE YOU REALLY ON, KYOKO?

156
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:38,458
- WHAT THE HELL DO YOU MEAN?

157
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:40,375
- I'M TALKING ABOUT
IN YOUR HEART.

158
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:42,500
WHO ARE YOU
ACTUALLY ROOTING FOR?

159
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:44,666
NOBUHIKO AND THE GUYS
ARE COLLECTING FUNDS

160
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,083
'CAUSE THEY WANT TO
PUT A STOP TO PROJECT D.

161
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:50,500
IF YOU'RE NOT DOWN WITH IT,
DON'T CHIP IN.

162
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:52,583
LOOK, I'M NOT SAYING THIS
TO BE AN ASSHOLE.

163
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:54,625
I MEAN, YOU GET ME, RIGHT?

164
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:58,541
- MMM-HMM.

165
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:00,708
- THERE'S ONE MORE THING
I THINK YOU OUGHT TO KNOW.

166
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:02,375
THE TAKAHASHI
BROTHERS ARE THE SONS

167
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,208
OF A BIG-TIME HOSPITAL
ADMINISTRATOR,

168
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:06,125
THEIR FAMILY IS TOTALLY
FREAKING LOADED.

169
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:07,458
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

170
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:10,000
WHY AM I ALWAYS THE LAST ONE
TO KNOW THIS STUFF?

171
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:12,250
- THEY'RE BOTH GOOD LOOKING GUYS
WITH MONEY TO BURN,

172
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:14,375
THOSE DUDES ARE IN A LEAGUE
OF THEIR OWN.

173
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:16,958
I'M NOT SAYING IT'S IMPOSSIBLE,
I'M JUST SAYING.

174
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:18,875
- LIKE HE'D NEVER NOTICE ME?

175
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,083
- NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT.
IT'S JUST...

176
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:23,000
I MEAN THEY'RE BOTH
REALLY POPULAR.

177
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:24,250
SO, YOU'D JUST BE
SETTING YOURSELF UP

178
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:26,458
FOR HEARTACHE. YOU KNOW THAT.

179
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:32,250
LOOK, IT'S THE TRUTH, ALL RIGHT.
I WAS ONLY TRYING TO HELP OUT.

180
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:40,541
- I DON'T NEED YOUR HELP.

181
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:43,750
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

182
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:50,125
- ( tires screeching )

183
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:14,708
- DAMN. LOOKS TO ME LIKE HE'S
COMING RIGHT ALONG, HUH?

184
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:16,166
- YOU KNOW, THERE ARE
PURISTS OUT THERE

185
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,250
WHO WOULD CALL THIS CHEATING,

186
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:18,416
BUT I REALLY COULDN'T CARE LESS

187
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,500
WHAT THEY THINK
ABOUT OUR TACTICS.

188
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:22,500
SO LONG AS PROJECT D LOSES.

189
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:35,833
- Itsuki: YOU'RE CHANGING THE
REGISTRATION ON THE EIGHT-SIX?

190
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:38,916
SO WHAT'S YOUR OLD MAN PLANNING
ON TEARING AROUND TOWN IN?

191
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,750
- HE SAID HE'S ABOUT
TO BUY SOMETHING USED.

192
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:42,916
- USED? THAT'S TERRIBLE!

193
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,250
- I DON'T THINK HE WANTED TO
TELL ME WHAT IT IS YET.

194
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:47,125
FROM THE WAY HE WAS CARRYING
ON ABOUT HIS AGE

195
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:49,125
YOU'D THINK IT WAS A VAN
OR STATION WAGON

196
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:50,500
OR SOME PIECE
OF CRAP HATCHBACK.

197
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,000
- OH, YOU'RE KILLING ME.

198
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:53,958
DON'T GIVE ME
A VISUAL LIKE THAT.

199
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:56,458
THAT MAN WAS ONCE THE RACING
PRIDE OF THIS WHOLE REGION.

200
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:59,333
HE CAN'T LET HIMSELF BE SEEN
BEHIND THE WHEEL OF A VAN.

201
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:00,833
- HE HAS GOTTEN OLD, DUDE.

202
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:03,416
IT'S NOT LIKE HE'S EVER GOING
TO START RACING AGAIN.

203
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,833
IT DOESN'T MATTER
HOW GOOD YOU ARE,

204
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:06,958
IN THE END A GUY CAN ONLY
LIVE UP TO HIS OWN LEGEND

205
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:09,708
FOR SO LONG, YOU KNOW?

206
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:11,333
- ( Bunta sneezing )

207
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:16,541
- I GUESS I BETTER GET GOING.

208
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:18,291
I'M GONNA BE LATE FOR OUR
MEETING TONIGHT.

209
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:19,916
I'LL CATCH UP
WITH YOU LATER, MAN.

210
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,208
- DON'T FORGET WHO YOU'RE
REPRESENTING OUT THERE, BUDDY.

211
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:24,791
AND GOOD LUCK. ME AND THE GUYS
ARE GONNA BE THERE TOMORROW

212
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:26,333
TO CHEER YOU ON.

213
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:47,458
- Ryosuke: I'LL BE
HONEST WITH YOU.

214
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:50,041
THE WAY THINGS ARE GOING,
I THINK THIS RACE MIGHT SHAPE UP

215
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:53,250
TO BE THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE
TAKUMI'S EVER FACED.

216
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:54,833
- YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.

217
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:56,750
CONSIDERING THE KIND OF DRIVERS
HE'S ALREADY GONE UP AGAINST,

218
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:59,166
I'D BE SURPRISED IF HE
FOUND ANYTHING A CHALLENGE.

219
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,916
I MEAN, WE ARE TALKING
ABOUT THE SAME TAKUMI

220
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,958
WHO DUSTED A PROFESSIONAL,
AREN'T WE?

221
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:04,458
- TOMORROW NIGHT'S RACE
WILL MAKE THAT ONE

222
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:07,500
LOOK LIKE A WALK IN THE
PARK, MOST LIKELY.

223
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:10,625
- HUH? WHAT COULD BE TOUGHER
THAN RACING A PROFESSIONAL?

224
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:12,166
- TAKE MY WORD FOR IT,

225
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,333
YOUR TOUGHEST OPPONENT ISN'T
ALWAYS THE GUY YOU'RE RACING.

226
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:16,333
- SORRY, MAN.
I DON'T GET YOUR MEANING.

227
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:18,083
- YOU WILL SOON ENOUGH.

228
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:20,666
I'M GONNA TAKE A LITTLE NAP.

229
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,333
IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND
WAKING ME UP WHEN WE GET THERE,

230
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:23,541
I'D APPRECIATE IT.

231
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:25,708
- YEAH, NOT A PROBLEM.

232
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:29,666
"NOT THE GUY YOU'RE RACING"?
WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?

233
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:47,958
- LOOK WHO IT IS.

234
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:57,458
- WELL, HIYA, FELLAS. WE WERE
WONDERING WHEN YOU'D SHOW UP.

235
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:01,500
OH, COME ON,
YOU REMEMBER ME, DON'T YOU?

236
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:03,250
- OF COURSE, HOW COULD I FORGET?

237
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:06,000
- DON'T WORRY. YOU DON'T HAVE TO
GO UP AGAINST ME IN THIS RACE.

238
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:07,916
I'M HERE FOR MORAL SUPPORT.

239
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,750
- HOLD ON. AREN'T YOU...

240
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:12,333
- YES. SORRY FOR ALL
THE FAMILIAR FACES.

241
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,916
I'M ONLY HERE
TO SET EVERYTHING UP.

242
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,208
WE'VE BROKEN IN THE COURSE
FOR YOU, SO TO SPEAK.

243
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:19,208
BY ALL MEANS,
PRACTICE AS LONG AS YOU NEED.

244
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:21,625
- THANK YOU.
- SEE YOU AROUND.

245
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,166
- LOT OF HUMIDITY IN THE AIR.

246
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:29,625
THAT MEANS MORE
THAN A GOOD CHANCE

247
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:31,041
FOR RAIN TOMORROW NIGHT.

248
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:33,125
- NOT EXACTLY
AN IDEAL SITUATION.

249
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:34,916
- WELL, IT SHOULDN'T
BE A PROBLEM

250
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,333
ONCE YOU'VE GOT THE DETAILS
OF THIS COURSE

251
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,291
ETCHED INTO YOUR BRAIN.

252
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:42,500
STAY FOCUSED. I WANT FIFTY
RUNS BEFORE DAYBREAK.

253
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:44,833
- RIGHT.
- HELL, YEAH.

254
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:48,375
- ( engine revving )

255
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:50,541
- IT LOOKS LIKE
EVERYTHING CHECKS OUT.

256
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:52,166
READY WHEN YOU ARE, DUDE.

257
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,791
- OKAY, MAN. LET HER RIP.

258
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:17,708
- I WONDER WHERE KYOKO IS?

259
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:41,708
- ( tires screeching )

260
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:04,625
- THE PROJECT D GUYS
WILL HAVE STARTED

261
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:07,250
THEIR PRACTICE RUNS BY NOW.

262
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:09,875
I REALLY WANT TO GO
SEE THEM, BUT...

263
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:12,333
I DON'T DARE.

264
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:14,708
I FEEL LIKE THE BAT FROM
THE STUPID AESOP'S FABLE

265
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:16,291
MOM USED TO READ ME.

266
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:20,291
NOT A BIRD. NOT A BEAST,
JUST LEFT OUT.

267
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:28,750
- ( thunder rumbling )

268
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:30,791
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?
IS IT GONNA RAIN TOMORROW?

269
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:34,000
- PROBABLY, YES, BUT FOR
OUR INTENTS AND PURPOSES,

270
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:35,583
THE BAD WEATHER MAY
JUST TURN OUT THE BE

271
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:37,250
SAKAMOTO'S ACE IN THE HOLE.

272
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:39,291
THE MORE WET AND TREACHEROUS
THE ROAD GETS,

273
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:41,291
THE MORE ADVANTAGEOUS
THAT VEHICLE'S LIGHT WEIGHT

274
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:43,083
BECOMES FOR HIM IN THE RACE.

275
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:45,208
- YEAH, BUT, IF IT RAINS
WON'T THEY JUST CANCEL?

276
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:47,125
I MEAN, WE CAN'T EXPECT
THEM TO RISK THEIR NECKS

277
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:48,458
FOR A RACE LIKE THIS.

278
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:51,333
- CANCEL? HARDLY.
BOTH CARS ARE FD'S, AFTER ALL,

279
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:53,750
AND THEY'LL BE DRIVING
UNDER THE SAME CONDITIONS.

280
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:55,875
BESIDES, THEY'RE NOT THE TYPE
TO BACK DOWN

281
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:57,541
BECAUSE OF A LITTLE RAIN.

282
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,541
THE SITUATION'S NEARLY PERFECT.

283
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:03,416
YOU KNOW, IF I WERE
THE SUPERSTITIOUS TYPE,

284
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,750
I'D THINK LADY LUCK
HAD A LITTLE CRUSH ON US.

285
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:07,125
ONE MIGHT SAY OUR STRATEGY

286
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:09,458
AGAINST THE D BOYS
IS WATERTIGHT.

287
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:11,083
- ( upbeat song playing )

288
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,916
- GIVE HER A LITTLE GAS.
ONLY TEN LITERS.

289
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,583
- RIGHT.

290
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:33,458
- KEISUKE.

291
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:34,708
ONCE YOU'RE USED TO IT,

292
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:36,541
DRIVE THE COURSE WITH
JUST YOUR FOG LIGHTS ON.

293
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:38,916
TRY TO MAKE THE RUN
WITHOUT HIGH BEAMS.

294
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,416
VISIBILITY WILL WORSEN
IF IT STARTS TO POUR.

295
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,625
YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO DRIVE
THIS COURSE FROM MEMORY,

296
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:47,333
NOT BASED ON WHAT YOU WON'T
BE ABLE TO SEE TOMORROW NIGHT.

297
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:50,083
- AS A PRECAUTION AGAINST THE
RAIN, HUH? SURE THING, BRO.

298
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:51,791
I'LL DO THE BEST I CAN.

299
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:58,000
- ♪ AND YOU'RE SPINNING LIKE
YOU'RE NEVER STOPPING ♪

300
00:16:58,083 --> 00:16:59,916
♪ YOU NEVER DID BEFORE ♪

301
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,416
♪ SPINNING MORE ♪

302
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,916
♪ STEEL BLADE ♪

303
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,750
♪ YOU'RE TURNING FAST,
A COUNTDOWN TO THE BLAST ♪

GET HIM OUT OF MY HEAD?

308
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:33,375
MY BABY'S FD?

309
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:45,125
OH, WHAT THE HELL.
NO ONE'S LOOKING.

310
00:17:58,083 --> 00:17:59,250
( gasps )

311
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:04,000
WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN THERE?

312
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,583
- THE HELL ARE YOU DOING
OUT HERE?

313
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:09,625
LAST TIME I CHECKED
THIS WAS MY CAR.

314
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:12,750
- SORRY, I DIDN'T MEAN TO
OVERREACT. YOU JUST STARTLED ME.

315
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:15,583
BUT SERIOUSLY, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING IN A PLACE LIKE THIS?

316
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:17,958
- I WAS JUST TRYING TO CATCH UP
ON A FEW Z'S, YOU KNOW.

317
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:19,750
I'VE GOT A BIG RACE
COMING UP TONIGHT.

318
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:21,333
- OH, THAT'S RIGHT! I HEARD!

319
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:24,208
GOOD LUCK TO YOU AND YOUR
TEAM TONIGHT, I HOPE YOU WIN.

320
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:27,791
- THANKS, WE'RE GONNA NEED IT.
I'VE BARELY SLEPT A WINK.

321
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:30,166
IT'S TOO DAMN BRIGHT OUT HERE,
PLUS I'M SO HUNGRY RIGHT NOW

322
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:32,416
I THINK I COULD
EAT A FREAKING HORSE.

323
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,333
DO YOU WANT TO
GRAB A BITE OR SOMETHING?

324
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:50,833
- SO, PLACES LIKE THIS,
DO YOU LIKE THEM?

325
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:54,416
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN "LIKE THIS"?

326
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,875
- FAMILY RESTAURANTS.
- HUH?

327
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:59,125
OH, YEAH,
I LOVE THIS KIND OF FOOD.

328
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:01,750
STREET RACERS NEED A LOT
OF CARBS TO STAY SHARP.

329
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:04,000
- I GUESS THAT MAKES
A LOT OF SENSE.

330
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:07,083
FOR A RICH KID WHOSE DAD
RUNS A MAJOR HOSPITAL,

331
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:10,416
MY DARLING SURE IS
DOWN TO EARTH. THANK GOD!

332
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:18,708
- HEY, KEISUKE'S GONE. WHERE
DO YOU THINK HE RAN OFF TO?

333
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:20,958
- HE PROBABLY JUST WENT FOR A
BITE TO EAT OR SOMETHING,

334
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:22,291
HE'LL BE BACK BEFORE LONG.

335
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:23,666
- SO WHAT DID HE DO? HIKE?

336
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:26,625
- WELL, WHY WOULDN'T HE?
I SAY WE FOLLOW HIS LEAD.

337
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:28,416
- AW, MAN THAT SMELLS GOOD.

338
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,416
I BET WHEN THE WEATHER'S NICE
LIKE THIS,

339
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,916
THIS PLACE IS PERFECT
FOR HIKING.

340
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,625
HEY, PASS ME SOME TEA,
WOULD YOU?

341
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:40,666
- Kenta: SURE.
- THANKS.

342
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,208
- YOU GET ANY SHUT-EYE?

343
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:44,333
- YEAH, SOME.
ABOUT THREE HOURS WORTH.

344
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:45,958
- GET A FEW MORE
WHEN YOU'RE DONE.

345
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:48,416
YOU'LL NEED YOUR ENERGY
FOR THE RACE TONIGHT.

346
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,958
EVEN IF YOU CAN'T SLEEP,

347
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:52,541
JUST RELAXING WITH YOUR EYES
CLOSED OUGHT TO DO THE TRICK.

348
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:54,666
- YEAH. SURE THING.

349
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,875
I THINK I'D LIKE TO GET
A FEW MORE PRACTICE RUNS IN

350
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:58,666
BEFORE I DO, THOUGH.

351
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:01,083
I WANT TO DOUBLE-CHECK THE
PLACES WHERE PUDDLES MIGHT FORM

352
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:03,333
WHILE THERE'S STILL
ENOUGH LIGHT.

353
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:05,916
- SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN.
- THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

354
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,250
THE WEATHER'S HELD SO FAR,

355
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:09,500
BUT I DON'T LIKE THE LOOK
OF THOSE CLOUDS.

356
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:14,208
- Kyoko: YOU ALWAYS
SLEEP IN YOUR CAR

357
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:17,166
WHEN PROJECT D'S
OUT IN THE FIELD?

358
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,125
- WELL, MOST OF THE TIME, YEAH.

359
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:21,541
NOT REALLY THE BEST WAY
TO DO IT, THOUGH, I'LL ADMIT.

360
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:24,000
THOSE BUCKET SEATS ARE ABSOLUTE
HELL ON THE LOWER BACK.

361
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:26,375
- YOU POOR THING.
WHY DON'T YOU JUST GET A ROOM

362
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:27,750
AT A HOTEL OR SOMETHING?

363
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:29,791
- THE DRIVING-ALL-NIGHT,
SLEEPING-ALL-DAY THING

364
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:31,458
DOESN'T MAKE US LOOK
ALL THAT GREAT.

365
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:34,625
SO NO REPUTABLE HOTEL WANTS
ANYTHING TO DO WITH OUR CROWD.

366
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:38,791
- OH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
I DIDN'T THINK OF THAT.

367
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:41,125
- ( sighing ) NOW THAT
I'VE STUFFED MYSELF,

368
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:42,791
I'M GETTING KINDA SLEEPY.

369
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,666
MIND IF WE START
HEADING BACK?

370
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,166
- ( rain pattering )

371
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,083
- LOOKS LIKE
IT'S STARTING TO RAIN.

372
00:20:56,791 --> 00:21:00,458
OH, GOD. WHAT DO I DO?
HE'S ASLEEP!

373
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:08,958
I'LL SLOW DOWN A LITTLE SO THE
RIDE DOESN'T JAR HIM AWAKE.

374
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:11,041
POOR BABY. HE'S WORN OUT.

375
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:28,333
IF TIME FROZE LIKE THIS,
IN THIS MOMENT,

376
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:31,291
I'D BE THE HAPPIEST GIRL ALIVE.

377
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:37,875
YOU LISTENING UP THERE, BIG GUY?

378
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:41,791
IF YOU STOPPED TIME RIGHT NOW,
I'D OWE YOU ONE.

379
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:55,166
- JUST PERFECT.
THIS RAIN IS SOME BULLSHIT.

380
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:58,000
GUESS WE'LL JUST HAVE TO
ACCEPT IT AND DEAL, RIGHT?

381
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:04,333
- WHY WOULD ANYONE RACE
IN A DOWNPOUR LIKE THIS?

382
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:07,500
I THINK YOU GUYS HAVE FINALLY
LOST YOUR MINDS, BRO.

383
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:12,333
- THIS ISN'T GOING TO LET UP
ANY TIME SOON.

384
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:15,833
- GUESS NOT. WHICH IS SURE TO
MAKE TONIGHT'S RACE INTERESTING.

385
00:22:15,916 --> 00:22:18,375
- HEY, YOU DON'T THINK THEY'RE
GOING TO CANCEL IT, DO YOU?

386
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:20,291
- WHAT, ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

387
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:22,625
START CLOSING UP SHOP.
WE'RE HEADING OUT.

388
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:24,250
- AYE AYE, SIR!

389
00:22:36,208 --> 00:22:41,166
- WHAT THE HELL? OH, CRAP!
I CAN'T BELIEVE I FELL ASLEEP!

390
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:42,666
HEY, DO YOU KNOW
WHAT TIME IT IS?

391
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:45,875
- IT'S ABOUT SIX O'CLOCK.

392
00:22:45,958 --> 00:22:48,083
- SON OF A BITCH,
I'M GONNA BE LATE!

393
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:49,625
I'M REAL SORRY,
THIS ISN'T LIKE ME.

394
00:22:49,708 --> 00:22:51,250
I'M USUALLY NOT ABLE
TO SLEEP IN A CAR

395
00:22:51,333 --> 00:22:54,541
FOR MORE THAN TWO
OR THREE HOURS.

396
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:56,291
IT'S PROBABLY A BAD TIME
TO ASK NOW,

397
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:59,208
BUT IS IT OKAY THAT YOU SPENT
YOUR ENTIRE AFTERNOON WITH ME?

398
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:02,750
I MEAN, NO ONE WAS EXPECTING YOU
OR ANYTHING, WERE THEY?

399
00:23:02,833 --> 00:23:06,041
- OH, NO, I HAD NOTHING ELSE
PLANNED TODAY ANYWAY.

400
00:23:06,125 --> 00:23:09,208
IT'S TOTALLY ALL RIGHT.
IT'S NOT LIKE I'LL BE MISSED.

401
00:23:09,291 --> 00:23:11,291
- YOU'RE MESSING WITH ME, RIGHT?

402
00:23:13,958 --> 00:23:16,041
I HATE TO BAIL ON YOU
LIKE THIS, BUT...

403
00:23:18,291 --> 00:23:22,250
MAN, I HOPE THERE'S STILL ENOUGH
TIME FOR ME TO TUNE THE FD.

404
00:23:25,416 --> 00:23:26,791
- ( engine starting )

405
00:23:33,125 --> 00:23:35,416
- SERIOUSLY. THANK YOU.

406
00:23:49,166 --> 00:23:50,833
- HEY! THEY'RE HERE!

407
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:58,125
IS THAT A CAPPUCCINO?

408
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:07,041
- SO, HEY, RYOSUKE,
I'VE BEEN THINKING OVER

409
00:24:07,125 --> 00:24:08,458
WHAT WE WERE TALKING
ABOUT LAST NIGHT,

410
00:24:08,541 --> 00:24:10,541
AND I THINK I FINALLY GET IT.

411
00:24:10,625 --> 00:24:14,041
TAKUMI HASN'T FACED A CHALLENGE
LIKE THIS. NOT EVER.

412
00:24:17,208 --> 00:24:18,625
MAN, THIS ISN'T GOOD.

413
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:21,291
THESE GUYS HAVE REALLY GOT US
BY THE BALLS, DON'T THEY?

414
00:24:21,375 --> 00:24:23,000
THE BRAINS BEHIND
THIS OUTFIT IS SMARTER

419
00:24:47,791 --> 00:24:49,250
