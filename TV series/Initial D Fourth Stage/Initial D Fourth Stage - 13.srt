00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:17,125
AT THE STATION THESE DAYS?

- YEAH, THE PAY'S CRAP,

00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:19,875
BUT IT'S SUCH A BLAST TO BE
WORKING ALL DAY,

10
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:22,625
COVERED IN GREASE, FIXING
STUFF UP FOR PEOPLE.

I'M JUST GLAD I GET TO SPEND
ALL DAY AROUND CARS.

THESE PAST FEW YEARS, ITSUKI.

00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:33,375
ONCE YOU GOT OUT AROUND PEOPLE,
SOMETHING CHANGED IN YOU.

14
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:36,750
- COME ON, CUT IT OUT. I HAVEN'T
CHANGED ALL THAT MUCH, HAVE I?

15
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:42,083
AND WHAT ABOUT YOU? I MEAN, LOOK

WHOA.

THE SAME PERSON I ALWAYS WAS.

18
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:33,916
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?

19
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,625
WHAT IS IT, DO I HAVE FOOD

WANNA LOOK STUPID.

DAMN BEAUTIFUL!

- ( thunderclap )

24
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:53,541
- I NEED TO STRETCH THIS
INTO AN ENDURANCE RACE.

25
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:56,708
NO WAY MY STREET STAMINA'LL
LOSE OUT TO YOU, RICH BOY.

26
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,708
- YOU PUT A LOT OF TIME AND
EFFORT INTO THAT SUPERCHARGER.

27
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:05,416
GETTING THE POWER THAT'S
EASIEST TO USE, I GUESS.

28
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,958
THIS WON'T BE AN EASY WIN.

29
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:09,458
I DOUBT I'LL BE ABLE TO
SHUT HIM DOWN FAST.

30
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,416
WITH THE RAIN POURING DOWN
LIKE THIS,

31
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,291
LOOKS LIKE THE TIME TRIAL'S
OFF THE DOCKET.

32
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:14,875
GUESS WE MIGHT AS WELL GO WILD.

33
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:16,166
LET'S TURN IT OUT!

34
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:25,208
- I FORGOT TO TELL YOU.
I GOT MY DRIVER'S LICENSE.

35
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:27,958
- WOW. THAT'S GREAT.
IS IT JUST FOR AUTOMATICS

36
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:29,416
OR CAN YOU
DRIVE STANDARD, TOO?

37
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,916
- NO. I GOT THE THING
FOR STANDARDS.

38
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,875
IF I FELT UP TO IT, I COULD
EVEN GET BEHIND THE WHEEL

39
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:35,791
OF MY BROTHER'S LEVIN
AND TEAR IT UP.

40
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:38,833
NOT THAT HE REALLY ENJOYS
LETTING ME. HE HAS SOME,

41
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:41,416
BUT THE STEERING ON IT IS KINDA
HEAVY. IT'S A TOUGH MACHINE.

42
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,208
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA BUY
YOUR OWN CAR?

43
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:45,375
- I WOULD, BUT DRIVING SCHOOL
WAS WAY TOO EXPENSIVE,

44
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:46,833
SO I'M BROKE.

45
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:48,208
I'LL HAVE TO SAVE UP, WHICH
COULD TAKE A LITTLE WHILE,

46
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:49,708
THE WAY THINGS HAVE BEEN GOING.

47
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,833
- I FORGOT TO TELL YOU! I PUT
A TURBO IN MY EIGHT-FIVE.

48
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,166
IT ROCKS SO HARD.

49
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,833
YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE
HOW FAST THAT MOTHER IS NOW!

50
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:56,250
I CAN EVEN KEEP UP
WITH IKETANI.

51
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:57,708
NO KIDDING.
I'VE GOTTEN THAT GOOD!

52
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:59,958
- SWEET. YOU'VE FINALLY DONE IT.

53
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:01,875
YOU'VE JOINED THE RANKS
OF THE TRUE STREET RACERS.

54
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:03,250
- YEAH, I GUESS I HAVE.

55
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:05,458
IF YOU WANT, YOU CAN DRIVE
MY CAR SOMETIME.

56
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:06,791
YOU'D LOVE THE WAY IT HANDLES.

57
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,875
- ( spectators cheering )

58
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:28,083
- SAY WHAT YOU WANT
ABOUT THESE DUDES,

59
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:29,791
THIS BATTLE IS
TOTALLY ABOUT CONTROL.

60
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:32,000
IT'S NOT LIKE THEY CAN JUST
GUN IT IN THIS DOWNPOUR.

61
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:33,958
THEY'LL SPIN OUT.
- YEAH, I KNOW.

62
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:35,791
AND DON'T FORGET THE SLOWER
THEY'RE ROLLING ON THE COURSE,

63
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:38,125
THE CRAPPIER THE ADVANTAGE
IS FOR THE FD.

64
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:42,125

- Nobuhiko: GOT IT.
CHECK BACK IN A FEW.

68
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,000
THEY'RE TURNING INTO THE HAIRPIN
AT THE CANYON RIGHT NOW.

69
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:57,083
AND THE FD'S BREATHING
DOWN HIS NECK.

70
00:05:57,166 --> 00:05:59,625
- THEY'RE JUST NOT GONNA LET US
WALK AWAY WITH AN EASY WIN.

71
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:02,041
THAT FD IS ROCKET CHARGED, MAN.

72
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:04,625
- KEEPING UP WITH WATARU'S LEVIN
IN THIS RAIN COULDN'T BE EASY

73
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:06,291
FOR ANYONE,
EVEN THIS GUY FROM D.

74
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:08,458
BUT CONSIDER ALL ASPECTS
OF HIS GAME.

75
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:09,666
WHEN HE RACED KYOKO,

76
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,625
I SAW THE WAY HE MANIPULATED
HIS ACCELERATOR,

77
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:13,458
AND I WOULDN'T PUT
ANYTHING PAST HIM.

78
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:16,250
- SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK? THIS
THING MIGHT LAST A WHILE, THEN?

79
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:18,416
- IT COULD. BUT THE
LONGER IT KEEPS UP,

80
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,250
THE BETTER IT IS FOR WATARU.

81
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:29,750
- YOU CAN SAY WHAT YOU WILL,

82
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:31,666
BUT I WAS UP AGAINST AN
S-THIRTEEN TURBO!

83
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,125
IT WAS A DEMON! I MEAN,
THERE WASN'T ONE FAIR THING

84
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:35,333
ABOUT THAT BATTLE.
( laughing )

85
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:37,250
- WHAT DOES ITSUKI THINK
HE'S DOIN' WITH HER?

86
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:38,416
GUY THINKS HE CAN DITCH US

87
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,541
TO LAUGH IT UP WITH
SOME PIECE OF TAIL?

88
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:42,875
DON'T JUST STAND THERE LIKE
A FENCE POST, TAKUMI,

89
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:44,333
DO SOMETHING.

90
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:46,458
- DUDE, WHY ME? YOU'RE THE
ONE WHO'S ACTING ALL PISSED.

91
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:49,166
- Iketani: JUST LOOK AT THAT
SMIRK. DOESN'T IT BUG YOU?

92
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,041
I MEAN, WHAT'S THE DEAL
WITH THOSE TWO?

93
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:52,875
- LOOK, I DIDN'T KNOW
WATARU WAS GONNA BE HERE

94
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:54,083
ANY MORE THAN YOU DID,

95
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:56,958
SO I DEFINITELY DIDN'T KNOW
HIS SISTER WAS.

96
00:06:57,041 --> 00:07:00,083
- I KNOW. IT'S JUST...
TO HAVE KAZUMI SHOW UP HERE

97
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:02,291
AT THE SAME TIME, THE SAME PLACE
AS ITSUKI. IT'S...

98
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:03,916
- Kenji: A HELLUVA COINCIDENCE.

99
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:07,250
SOAP OPERA WRITERS
COULDN'T DO BETTER.

100
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:11,000
- IF ITSUKI GETS A GIRL, IT'LL
BE A MONSTER BLOW TO MY EGO.

101
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:13,375
I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN TAKE IT.

102
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:17,333
- WHY CAN'T MAKO SHOW UP
OUT HERE TOO! DAMMIT, WHY?!

103
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:19,333
( sulking ) THIS SUCKS.

104
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,208
- HEY, MAN, I GOT SOMETHIN'
I'D LIKE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT

105
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:32,041
IF YOU DON'T MIND.
YOU GOT A FEW MINUTES?

106
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:39,083
- Keisuke: NICE JOB
KEEPIN' UP WITH ME.

107
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:40,875
I KNOW WHAT HE'S
FIGHTING THROUGH.

108
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:43,000
DRIVING A HIGH-POWERED
TURBO ON A RAINY NIGHT

109
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:45,250
IS A PAIN IN THE ASS.

110
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:47,750
I HATE TO ADMIT IT,
BUT THE PUNK HAS SKILLS.

111
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:55,125
- Sakamoto: THERE'S JUST ONE
THING I'VE GOTTA ASK YOU.

112
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:58,041
- YEAH, AND I'M BETTING IT'S
ABOUT THAT LAST STRAIGHTAWAY

113
00:07:58,125 --> 00:07:59,208
BEFORE THE FINISH LINE.

114
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:02,208
- NO, IT ISN'T THAT.
I'M A RALLY DRIVER.

115
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:03,875
I LIKE TO DRIVE POINT A TO B.

116
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:06,000
I REALLY COULDN'T CARE LESS
ABOUT LOOKING COOL,

117
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:07,541
DRIFTING AROUND CORNERS.

118
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:10,333
CHASING PEOPLE, WHO PASSES
WHO, IT ALL MEANS NOTHING TO ME.

119
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:12,875
I DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT STUFF.
IT'S NOT MY STYLE.

120
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:14,666
WHAT I WANNA KNOW
IS ABOUT YOU.

121
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,583
YOU GOT THIS BIG BAD MOTIVATION,

122
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:17,750
PUSHES YOU FURTHER
THAN ANYONE,

123
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:20,250
AND ALL I WANNA KNOW IS
WHERE YOU GET IT?

124
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:24,625
- ( tires screeching )

125
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:29,208
- Sakamoto: WHEN
WE WERE RACING,

126
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:32,166
ONE THING ABOUT YOU
REALLY STOOD OUT.

127
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,916
YOU HAVE A HELL OF A STRONG
WILL IN YOU.

128
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,125
YOU HAVE TO ADMIT, THOUGH,

129
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:37,625
IN TERMS OF OUR CARS'
TECHNICAL ABILITIES,

130
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:39,666
MINE HAS YOU BEAT
EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK.

131
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,708
OUR TECHNIQUES, THOUGH,
AREN'T THAT FAR OFF.

132
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:58,791
THIS IS SO WEIRD, MAN. STANDING
HERE, TALKING TO YOU RIGHT NOW,

133
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:01,250
YOU SEEM LIKE ANY OTHER DUDE
I'D FIND BEHIND A WHEEL.

134
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,291
THIS MOTIVATION OF YOURS,
NOTHING AFFECTS IT,

135
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:04,708
NOT EVEN THIS DAMN RAIN.

136
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:07,416
THAT'S EXACTLY THE KINDA THING
I NEED TO KNOW ABOUT.

137
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:21,333
ONLY AMATEURS PRETEND
THEY'RE NOT AFRAID OF THE RAIN.

138
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:24,208
RAIN AND ROADS,
AND DRIVING IN THE STUFF

139
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:27,625
WHITTLES YOUR CONCENTRATION
DOWN TO ALMOST NOTHING.

140
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:30,666
TO MAINTAIN CONCENTRATION FOR
AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME,

141
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,875
YOU GOTTA HAVE
THE MENTAL CAPACITY OF A GIANT.

142
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:35,125
I'M TALKIN' SERIOUS STAMINA,
YOU KNOW?

143
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:38,083
THAT'S WHAT I MEAN WHEN I
TALK ABOUT YOUR MOTIVATION.

144
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:39,583
AND THAT STRONG WILL OF YOURS?

145
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:42,250
THAT'S THE KIND OF THING I
RESPECT IN A DRIVER.

146
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,208
I'VE DRIVEN WITH A LOT OF GUYS
AND I CAN TELL BY NOW

147
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:49,458
THAT THIS KIND OF MOTIVATION
DOESN'T JUST POP UP

148
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:51,625
WITHOUT SOMETHING
PULLING IT THROUGH.

149
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:54,041
FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN,
YOU DRIVE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL.

150
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:57,125
- A PROFESSIONAL?
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.

151
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:07,250
- LISTEN UP! WE'RE STARTING
THE SECOND ROUND!

152
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:11,250
STARTING IN FIVE, FOUR,
THREE, TWO...

153
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:13,208
- THIS RUN'S GONNA BE HIS LAST.
- YEAH!

154
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:15,875
- Fumihiro: GO!
- ( cars revving )

155
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:23,458
- Nobuhiko: THIS COULD BE
INTERESTING,

156
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:25,500
BUT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT
THIS SECOND RUN.

157
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:28,750
KEEPING UP WITH THAT FD COULD
GET PRETTY DANGEROUS FOR HIM.

158
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:30,583
- I HOPE HE DOESN'T
HURT HIMSELF OUT THERE.

159
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:33,333
- I'M JUST WORRIED, IS ALL.
I KNOW HE CAN KEEP UP OUT THERE.

160
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:36,250
THIS ROUTE'S SIMILAR TO HIS
HOME COURSE, IN A LOT OF WAYS.

161
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:37,791
DRIVES THESE KINDS OF
ROADS EVERYDAY.

162
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:02,666
- HE'S DOIN' GOOD.

163
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:06,041
THIS RAIN'S GOTTA BEEN GRATING
ON A ROTARY TURBO LIKE HIS.

164
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:07,666
'CAUSE WITH A CAR LIKE THAT FD,

165
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,250
IF YOU'RE ROLLIN'
ON THIS SLICK A SURFACE,

166
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:11,500
YOU CAN'T POP
THAT ACCELERATOR TOO MUCH.

167
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:13,583
HE'S USING THE HALF-THROTTLE.

168
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:16,166
THAT'S A HIGH-LEVEL TECHNIQUE.
BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER.

169
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,583
MY PLAN'S STILL IN FULL EFFECT.

170
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:20,875
IN THE ENDURANCE RACE,
THE CAR THAT'S HARD TO HANDLE

171
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:22,125
WEARS DOWN IT'S DRIVER.

172
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:24,666
THAT'S WHAT WE GOT HERE.
AND THE SECOND THAT BOY

173
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,750
MAKES A MISTAKE,
I MAKE MY MOVE.

174
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:32,875
- YEAH, I KNOW, I HEAR YA.

175
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:35,916
BUT I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND
ANY OF THIS EITHER.

176
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,500
I ALWAYS WANT TO GET BETTER.
IT'S WHO I AM.

177
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:40,750
BUT YOU SAY
THE WORD 'PROFESSIONAL'.

178
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,416
IT JUST SEEMS LIKE
THE OTHER MEMBERS OF D

179
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,041
ARE A LOT BETTER CANDIDATES.

180
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:48,125
I PRACTICE. I SHOW UP ON TIME.
I DRIVE THE BEST THAT I CAN,

181
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,458
AND I TRY TO NOT DRAG THE TEAM
DOWN. THAT'S ME.

182
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:51,916
- YEAH, THAT'S ME, TOO.

183
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,791
IT MUST BE SOMETHING TO DO
WITH YOUR ENVIRONMENT, THEN.

184
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:57,416
HOW OLD ARE YOU?

185
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,250
- I'M NINETEEN.

186
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:03,125
- YOU'RE NINETEEN YEARS OLD?
MAN, I JUST TURNED 26 THIS YEAR.

187
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:05,833
I SWEAR, IF I HAD YOUR TECHNIQUE
WHEN I WAS NINETEEN,

188
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:07,916
THERE'S NO TELLING
WHAT I WOULD'VE ACCOMPLISHED.

189
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,541
I'D BE A DIFFERENT MAN WITH
A WAY DIFFERENT LIFE, RIGHT NOW,

190
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:12,041
NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.

191
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:13,375
I ENVY YOU, DUDE.

192
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:16,750
YOU'VE GOT EVERYTHING
GOING FOR YOU.

193
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:20,208
YOU CAN ALWAYS GET FASTER
AS LONG AS YOU GO FOR IT.

194
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:21,583
LATELY, I'VE BEEN IN SOMETHING.

195
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:23,416
I GUESS YOU COULD
CALL IT A FUNK.

196
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,750
I THOUGHT I'D PICK AT
YOUR BRAIN SOME,

197
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:26,166
SEE IF YOU COULD DROP
ME A FEW HINTS.

198
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:29,583
IT WAS WORTHd A SHOT.
SORRY IF I BOTHERED YOU.

199
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:37,708
- MOTIVATION, HUH? ALL THIS TIME
I'VE BEEN DRIVING,

200
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:40,875
I NEVER STOPPED TO CONSIDER
ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

201
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:44,625
WHEN I'M WITH PROJECT D, I JUST
FEEL MOTIVATED, NATURALLY.

202
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:46,625
MUST BE THE ENVIRONMENT,
LIKE HE SAID.

203
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:48,958
GUESS I'M LUCKY LIKE THAT.

204
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:55,791
AND I JUST STRAIGHT UP
LIKE THIS CAR.

205
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:58,083
THAT'S WHY THE STRONGEST FEELING
I HAVE RIGHT NOW,

206
00:12:58,166 --> 00:12:59,791
THE ONE THAT DROWNS OUT
ALL THE OTHERS

207
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:02,875
IS THAT I DO NOT WANT TO
LOSE TO KEISUKE!

208
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:23,708
- YEP, HE'S KEEPING UP.

209
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:29,916
NOT LIKE I CAN DO ANYTHING.

210
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,875
THE ENGINE'S OVERCOMPENSATING
FOR THE RAIN

211
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:35,000
AND SUCKIN' HALF THE POWER OUT,
SLIDING ME ALL OVER THE ROAD.

212
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:41,291
THE FD NEEDS A HIGHER SPEED
BATTLE TO SHOW ITS TRUE COLORS.

213
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:43,625
NOT LIKE THIS.

214
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:45,666
USED TO BE, I WOULD'VE POPPED
UNDER THE PRESSURE,

215
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,916
BUT WITH ALL THAT ACCELERATOR
TRAINING I'VE BEEN GETTING IN,

216
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
IT'S HELPING.

217
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:51,458
I'M CALMER. I JUST HAVE
TO STAY PATIENT.

218
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:53,625
WAIT FOR MY CHANCE IS GOING
TO SHOW ITSELF.

219
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:56,333
TAKUMI WON.
SO I'M GONNA WIN, TOO!

220
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:05,500
- Fumihiro: THE RACE IS AT
A STALEMATE, ISN'T IT?

221
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:07,583
IT'S NOT GOOD FOR KEISUKE
THAT THE BATTLE'S GONE ON

222
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:08,916
FOR AS LONG AS IT HAS.

223
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,583
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT
THE MECHANICS OF THE CAR

224
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:12,041
OR THE BAD DRIVING CONDITIONS.

225
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:13,375
THEY DON'T MATTER TONIGHT.

226
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:15,375
- SO YOU THINK THIS IS
A RACE OF SKILL SETS?

227
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:16,791
DRIVER VERSUS DRIVER?

228
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:18,958
EACH ONE WAITING TO SEE IF
THE OTHER'S CONCENTRATION

229
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:20,416
WILL GO FIRST?

230
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,041
- IT'S ALL ABOUT HOW LONG
KEISUKE'S CONCENTRATION

231
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:24,125
WILL LAST.

232
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:26,625
- YOU SOUND ALMOST HAPPY
ABOUT THAT.

233
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:28,458
- NO, NOT AT ALL.

234
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:31,041
BUT, THERE'S NOT A BETTER
OPPORTUNITY IN THE WORLD

235
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:34,333
FOR HIM TO MASTER HIS CURRENT
TOPIC THAN HERE, TONIGHT.

236
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:36,500
I HOPE HE GIVES IT EVERYTHING
IN HIS ARSENAL.

237
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:38,958
- YEAH, YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE.

238
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:41,416
- IF YOU CAN'T USE
YOUR TECHNIQUE TO WIN

239
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,375
IN A HIGH PRESSURE SITUATION,
THEN THERE'S NO POINT TO IT.

240
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:45,583
- YOU DON'T THINK THAT MAYBE
YOU'RE JUST A LITTLE EXTRA HARD

241
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:47,458
ON YOUR BROTHER SOMETIMES?

242
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,291
- JACKASS IS STILL ON ME.

243
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,458
THAT SUPERCHARGER
IS A GOOD IDEA.

244
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:02,833
I MEAN, EVEN THOUGH THEY BOTH
GOTTA USE THE AIR PRESSURE

245
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:04,333
TO MOVE THE TURBINES,

246
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:07,041
THE SUPERCHARGER CAN PULL POWER
RIGHT FROM THE CRANKSHAFT.

247
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:08,958
IT'S PRETTY IMPRESSIVE.

248
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:12,166
- BEST THING ABOUT
THIS SUPERCHARGER

249
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,125
IS YOU CAN GET THE
POWER LINEARLY

250
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:17,041
WHILE YOU'RE STILL INCREASING
ENGINE ROTATION.

251
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:19,333
TURBO CHARGERS HAVE TURBO LAG.

252
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:21,875
SUPERCHARGERS DON'T HAVE
ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

253
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:25,083
SURE, TURBOS MAYBE BE ABLE
TO KICK OUT A LITTLE MORE POWER,

254
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:28,666
BUT WITH THIS BABY, I GET A
CONSISTENT BOOST OF ENERGY

255
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,583
AS LONG AS I KEEP MY
FOOT PRESSED DOWN

256
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:32,416
ON THAT ACCELERATOR.

257
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:36,833
GET OUT ON A WINDING ROAD
WITH A LOW AVERAGE SPEED

258
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:39,375
AND THE SUPERCHARGER ABSOLUTELY
HAS THE UPPER HAND

259
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:40,416
OVER THE TURBO!

260
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,041
NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.

261
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,375
- Kenji: CRAZY. I CAN'T
BELIEVE THEY'RE GOING

262
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:03,916
INTO THE THIRD RUN.

263
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,208
THIS IS TAKING FOREVER.

264
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:06,916
I FIGURED THIS WOULD BE
A SLAM-DUNK.

265
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,166
IT MUST MEAN THAT
THE TWO OF THEM

266
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,500
ARE PRETTY CLOSE IN SKILL LEVEL,
DON'T YOU THINK?

267
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:12,500
- Takumi: NAH, IT'S THE RAIN.

268
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:14,875
BECAUSE OF THAT, THE CAR THAT'S
CHASING HAS AN EASIER TIME

269
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:17,291
MATCHING HIS PACE TO THE CAR
THAT'S OUT IN FRONT.

270
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:18,791
IF THEY WERE TO
MAKE SEPARATE RUNS,

271
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:21,750
THEIR TIMES WOULD DEPEND ON
HOW CAUTIOUS EACH DRIVER IS.

272
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:23,625
BUT TOGETHER,
UNDER THESE CONDITIONS,

273
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:25,916
THE DRIVERS PULL ON
EACH OTHER LIKE MAGNETS.

274
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,875
- I TELL YA, BOTH OF
THOSE GUYS HAVE GOTTA

275
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:29,125
BE GETTING TIRED BY NOW.

276
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:30,416
- OH, I'M SURE THEY ARE.

277
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,375
BUT THEY'RE PROBABLY
TOO FAR INTO IT TO NOTICE.

278
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:35,125
IF YOU START TO NOTICE THAT
YOU'RE GETTING TIRED

279
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:36,416
OR WORN DOWN, THAT'S REAL BAD.

280
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,791
IT'S THE FIRST SIGN THAT
YOUR CONCENTRATION

281
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:39,208
IS STARTING TO SLIP.

282
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:41,250
MY BET IS THAT WHEN THIS
BATTLE FINDS AN ENDING,

283
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,583
IT'S GONNA HAPPEN FROM
OUT OF NOWHERE.

284
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:52,458
- NO! I'M NOT LOSING THIS!

285
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:55,916
THIS BATTLE TONIGHT'S ALL ABOUT
MOTIVATION! AND I'VE GOT IT!

286
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,833
BASTARD, NEVER HAD
TO WORK FOR A DIME,

287
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:59,791
HE CAN'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT I COME FROM.

288
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:03,250
YOU CAN'T BUY THE DETERMINATION
I'VE GOT! I CAN'T LOSE,

289
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:05,125
THIS IS NOT HOW
THIS MOVIE ENDS!

290
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:14,958
- Itsuki: THIS TURNED INTO
ONE HECK OF A BATTLE, HUH?

291
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:16,708
- YEAH, NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.

292
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:18,458
THEY'VE BEEN DRIVING ALL NIGHT
IN THIS DOWNPOUR

293
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:20,458
AND THEY HAVEN'T TAKEN
A SINGLE BREAK.

294
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:23,083
- I'M IMPRESSED WATARU COULD BE
THAT EXTREME WITH HIS DRIVING.

295
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:25,000
HE'S REALLY GOING FOR
THE THROAT OF THAT FD.

296
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:26,791
THAT TAKES A WHOLE LOT OF GUTS.

297
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:30,166
OF COURSE I GOTTA ADMIRE ANYBODY
COOL ENOUGH TO DRIVE A LEVIN.

298
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,833
- YOU ACTUALLY
ADMIRE MY BROTHER?

299
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:34,250
- OH, HELL YEAH.

300
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:37,166
- WELL, DON'T BOTHER. WHAT'S SO
GREAT ABOUT HIM ANYWAY?

301
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,291
- QUESTION IS
WHAT'S NOT SO GREAT?

302
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:40,958
HE'S REALLY COOL,
HE'S INTO HIS CAR,

303
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:42,833
AND THE GUY DRIVES
LIKE A MANIAC.

304
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:45,458
IT'S SO BADASS HE'S DECIDED
TO STICK WITH HIS LEVIN

305
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:47,416
INSTEAD OF SWITCHING TO
SOMETHING HOT AND FLASHY.

306
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:52,750
- HE HASN'T SWITCHED BECAUSE
HE'S BROKE AS A PAY PHONE.

307
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:54,250
'COURSE, I DON'T HAVE
ANY MONEY EITHER.

308
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:56,208
IT'S NOT LIKE I'M
POINTING FINGERS.

309
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:59,583

310
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:10,416
- THE LEVIN'S STARTING TO
SHIMMY AROUND COMPARED

311
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:14,166
TO HOW SHE WAS A FEW MILES BACK.
HE MUST BE STARTING TO BURN OUT.

312
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:16,625
I GUESS IT'S TIME TO START
MAKING SOME OF MY MOVES.

313
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:19,500
PUT THE PRESSURE ON, AND SEE
WHAT IT TAKES TO CRACK THIS GUY!

314
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:27,916

PUSH ME INTO MAKING A MISTAKE.

315
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,166
BUT IT AIN'T GONNA HAPPEN. I'M
NOT THE ONLY ONE WEARING OUT.

316
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,208
IT'S JUST A MATTER OF

WE'RE NOT AT WAR

AFTER THAT, THINGS START
TO FALL APART.

FIVE HUNDRED MILES? HOW THE HECK
DO THEY PULL THAT OFF?

353

A MINOR STRESS
CAN TURN MAJOR, FAST.

367

YOUR ABILITY TO MULTITASK
WILL BEGIN TO FAIL.
