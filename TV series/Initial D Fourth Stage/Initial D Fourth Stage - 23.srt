WHEN I WAS LEADING EARLIER,

7
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,500
BUT HE'S RUNNING
DIFFERENT LINES.

8
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:35,833
HOW CAN HE STAY ON THOSE SCREWED
UP LINES AND STILL BE SO FAST?

9
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:29,791
- THE GUY YOU'RE GOIN' UP

YOU MIGHT NOT THINK YOU CAN WIN
BUT STICK TO YOUR GUNS

AND YOU MIGHT PULL THIS OFF.

14
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:41,416
TOUGH IT OUT.

15
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,916
REMEMBER, YOU AREN'T RACING
A MAN, YOU'RE RACING A GHOST.

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,958
- HUH!

17
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:48,791
- DON'T FORGET THAT.

18
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:53,541
- FINE, TOUGH IT OUT, I GET IT?

19
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:56,208
BUT FOR HOW LONG?

20
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,833
- HEY, HAVE YOU BEEN KEEPIN'
TRACK? HOW MANY RUNS IS THIS?

21
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:15,416
- LET ME THINK. THEY STARTED
WITH THE EIGHT-SIX LEADING,

22
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,416
SO I GUESS THAT MAKES
FOUR, FIVE...

23
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,958
THIS'LL BE THE SIXTH RUN.

24
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:22,166
- WOULD'VE FIGURED THE WHOLE
THING'D BE OVER BY NOW.

25
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,833
DIDN'T EXPECT IT TO
GO ON THIS LONG.

26
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:26,375
- THAT'S WHAT I FIGURED ON.
I THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS A LOCK,

27
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:28,083
BUT AFTER
EVERYTHING WE'VE SEEN SO FAR,

28
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:30,416
I DON'T KNOW WHOSE
GONNA WIN ANYMORE.

29
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:43,708
- THERE IT GOES AGAIN!

30
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:46,875
THE LINE HE IS USING,
IT CHANGES EVERY SINGLE RUN!

31
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:59,000
THIS DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

32
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:00,250
IS THAT THE KIND OF
THING HE DOES

33
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,083
WHEN HE GOES FOR A TIME ATTACK?

34
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:04,500
'CAUSE IF THE DUDE CAN PULL OFF
A RECORD TIME DOING THIS,

35
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:07,083
THEN WHY DOES HE EVEN BOTHER
CHOOSING LINES AT ALL?

36
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:29,458
- SOMETHING ABOUT TONIGHT
FEELS OFF. SCREWED UP.

37
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:31,250
CAN'T PUT MY FINGER ON IT.

38
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:33,208
IT'S POSSIBLE THERE'S SOME
FACTOR WE CAN'T SEE

39
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,583
THAT'S KEEPING JOSHIMA
FROM BEING ABLE TO PULL AWAY.

40
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:36,875
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS,

41
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:38,291
BUT IT FEELS LIKE THERE'S
A HITCH IN HIS PLAN.

42
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:39,666
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN HITCH?

43
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,875
- IF HE'S BEEN STRINGING THE
EIGHT-SIX ALONG ON PURPOSE,

44
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:45,375
LIKE IT SEEMS,
JOSHIMA MIGHT HAVE

45
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:48,916
A RUDE AWAKENING WAITING FOR HIM
AROUND ONE OF THESE TURNS.

46
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,666
GOD ARM ISN'T THE ONLY ONE
OUT THERE WITH A STRATEGY.

47
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:00,541
- THIS IS BAD.
IT'S GETTING WAY TOO CLOSE.

48
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:03,666
FUMIHIRO, WHEN THEY FINISH
THE SIXTH RUN,

49
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,625
LET'S ASK THE PURPLE SHADOW
ABOUT TAKING A BREAK

50
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:06,958
TO TAKE REFILL THE GAS TANKS.

51
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:08,083
- SURE.

52
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:22,000
- ( sighs ) THIS HAS BEEN
A PAIN IN THE ASS.

53
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:24,541
I'M GETTIN' DRAGGED ALL OVER
THE COURSE OUT THERE, IT SUCKS.

54
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:26,750
- RYOSUKE WARNED YOU THIS GUY
WAS GONNA BE A MONSTER

55
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:28,041
ON THE ASPHALT.

56
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:31,000
- HE WAS RIGHT. OH, YEAH,
I WANTED TO ASK YOU.

57
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:32,541
DO YOU THINK I COULD
CHECK OUT THE TIME DATA

58
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:33,625
ON THE RACE SO FAR?

59
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:34,666
- MMM-HMM.

60
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:38,583
- I'M THINKIN' THERE'S GOTTA
BE A BIG DISPARITY

61
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:40,875
BETWEEN THE TIMES FOR THE RUNS.

62
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:42,583
IT LOOKS TO ME LIKE
THE S-TWO THOUSAND

63
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:44,166
IS CHANGING ITS
STYLE EVERY TIME.

64
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:45,666
I MEAN HE'S ALL OVER
THE PLACE.

65
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,666
- THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M SEEIN'
ACCORDING TO THIS READ OUT,

66
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,333
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO'S OUT OF SYNC TONIGHT.

67
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:51,291
- HUH?
- HERE SEE FOR YOURSELF.

68
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:55,375
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS CHART ON THE
SECOND, FOURTH, AND SIXTH RUNS

69
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:58,458
WHERE THE OTHER GUY
WAS LEADING YOU.

70
00:06:58,541 --> 00:07:01,750
IT'S ALMOST CREEPY HOW CLOSE
TOGETHER ALL OF HIS TIMES ARE.

71
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:04,083
HIS ABILITY TO MAINTAIN HIS
TIME IS SO ACCURATE

72
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:06,541
THAT IT BOARDERS A MECHANICAL.

73
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:08,208
- NO WAY. THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

74
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:10,708
HOW IS HE PULLING OFF
SUCH PERFECT TIMES?

75
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:22,375
- YOU THINK YOU'RE DRAGGING
THIS RACE OUT A LITTLE BIT?

76
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:24,833
I KNOW YOU'RE HAVING A GOOD TIME
AND ALL, BUT COME ON.

77
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:27,916
- NOT A CHANCE.
I'M NOT HAVING ONE BIT OF FUN.

78
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,333
I'VE BEEN DRIVING LIKE
A DESPERATE FOOL OUT THERE.

79
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:33,541
YOU MIGHT NOT SEE IT FROM HERE
BUT THE KID IS JUST THAT GOOD.

80
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:36,250
- I DON'T CARE HOW GOOD HE IS,
YOU KNOW IT'S A BAD IDEA

81
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:38,958
FOR OLD BOYS LIKE US
TO TAKE ON KIDS LIKE HIM

82
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,041
IN AN ENDURANCE TEST.

83
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:42,041
WE JUST DON'T HAVE IT
IN US ANYMORE.

84
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:43,291
- YEAH, I KNOW.

85
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:45,166
I'LL END THIS BUSINESS IN THE
NEXT RUN OR TWO.

86
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,875
- ALRIGHT. WE'LL BE WAITING
AT THE BOTTOM OF THE MOUNTAIN

87
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:49,291
TO CELEBRATE YOUR VICTORY.

88
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:50,416
- GOTCHA.

89
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:55,541
- DON'T LET JOSHIMA
INTO YOUR HEAD.

90
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:57,625
HE'LL ONLY TRY TO CONFUSE YOU,
THROW YOU OFF YOUR LINE.

91
00:07:57,708 --> 00:07:59,083
SO BE CAREFUL.

92
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:01,125
THE FACT THAT YOUR TIMES
HAVE BEEN SO INCONSISTENT

93
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:02,666
WHEN YOU'RE LEADING,

94
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,416
ALL THAT SAYS IS THAT YOU'VE
BEEN FALLING UNDER HIS CONTROL,

95
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,125
RIGHT WHERE HE WANTS YOU TO BE,
SO HE CAN CLENCH THE WIN.

96
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:09,083
DON'T ALLOW YOURSELF TO GET
FOOLED BY WHAT YOU SEE

97
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:10,291
HIM DOING ON THE ROAD.

98
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:11,958
- TRUST YOUR INSTINCTS.
- HMM.

99
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:23,291
- Ryosuke: THERE'S GONNA BE
A HUGE FLIP IN THIS RACE

100
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:24,375
ON THE SEVENTH RUN.

101
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:26,208
THERE'S NO NEED
TO MATCH HIS PACE.

102
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:28,041
JUST RELAX
AND DO YOU OWN THING.

103
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:30,666
YOUR BEST SHOT IS TO TAKE
THE COUNTER-OFFENSIVE.

104
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,375
YOU SHOULD'VE ALREADY
NOTICED THAT YOU CAN USE

105
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:34,416
THE GUTTERS AND HEDGES
ON THIS COURSE.

106
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,750
YOU NEED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF THAT WHEN YOU CAN.

107
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:38,708
PAY ATTENTION TO THOSE THINGS.

108
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:40,583
I DON'T THINK I HAVE TO REMIND
YOU EVERYTHING PROJECT D

109
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:42,250

THE HELL OUT OF TAKUMI.

114
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:08,125
I DON'T THINK HE'D EVEN
EVER CONSIDERED THE POSSIBILITY

115
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:09,416
OF RUNNING THE EXACT SAME TIME.

116
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,083
HE'S IN COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT LINES.

117
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:12,583
AND, TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST,

118
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:15,000
I'M HAVING A HARD TIME WRAPPING
MY HEAD AROUND IT MYSELF.

119
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:16,375
IN ALL MY YEARS
DOING THIS STUFF,

120
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:18,708
I'VE NEVER HEARD OF ANYONE
MAKIN' THAT HAPPEN.

121
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:21,291
- THE LINES MAY CHANGE BUT
THEY'RE NOT WHAT'S IMPORTANT.

122
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:23,583
CONSISTENCY HELPS BUT RUNNING
THE COURSE THE SAME WAY

123
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:25,916
EACH TIME IS UNNECESSARY.

124
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,041
REMEMBER, OUR OPPONENT HAS
YEARS OF EXPERIENCE ON US.

125
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:33,333
- WHEN IT'S STILL POSSIBLE
HOWEVER UNLIKELY.

126
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:36,291
- ABSOLUTELY. BUT I'M ALSO
CERTAIN THAT JOSHIMA

127
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:37,541
DOES HAVE A FAVORITE LINE

128
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:39,000
AND THAT WE HAVEN'T
SEEN IT YET.

129
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:41,166
- ( gasps ) THEN THAT
WOULD MEAN...

130
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:44,416
- HE'S HOLDING BACK.
ALMOST TOYING WITH HIM.

131
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:48,291
I ONLY HOPE FUJIWARA HAS
REALIZED IT BY NOW.

132
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:52,291
HE DIDN'T GET THE NICKNAME
GOD ARM FOR NOTHING.

133
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:54,833
I'M ASSUMING THAT HE HAS THE
ABILITY TO DRIVE EQUALLY FAST

134
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:56,166
ON DIFFERENT LINES
WHICH EXPLAINS

135
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:59,458
HOW HE'S BEEN ABLE TO KEEP
HIS TIME SO CONSISTENT.

136
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:03,041
THAT BEING SAID, HE SHOULD STILL
HAVE SPECIFIC LINES THAT HE USES

137
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:06,291
WHEN HE'S GUNNING
FOR HIS BEST TIME.

138
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:08,750
BUT EVEN AFTER ALL THESE RUNS
HE'S HASN'T TIPPED HIS HAND

139
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:10,000
TO US QUITE YET.

140
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:12,333
HE'S WAITING FOR THE
RIGHT OPPORTUNITY.

141
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:15,750
- SO THAT'S WHY RYOSUKE TOLD
TAKUMI TO IGNORE HIS OPPONENT

142
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:17,916
AND CONCENTRATE
ONLY ON THE COURSE.

143
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,958
THAT'S WHAT HE MUST'VE MEANT
WHEN HE CALLED HIM A GHOST.

144
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:23,375
YOU'RE SAYING THAT TAKUMI'S
ABILITY TO ABSORB THE STRENGTHS

145
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:24,708
OF THE PEOPLE HE CHASES

146
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,666
IS HURTING HIM THE LONGER
HE'S BEHIND THIS GUY.

147
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:29,416
THE CLOSER HE WATCHES
THE LESS HE KNOWS WHAT TO DO.

148
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,083
HE SEES ALL OF THE DUMMY LINES
JOSHIMA'S THROWING AT HIM

149
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:34,291
AND IT'S GETTIN' INSIDE HIS HEAD
AND CONFUSING HIM.

150
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:37,916
- YOU GOT IT. BUT THIS SEVENTH
RUN'S GONNA CHANGE THINGS UP.

151
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,333
I HAVE A FEELING THE GOOD DOCTOR
PLANS ON WINNING THIS THING

152
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:42,041
BY OVERTAKING THE LEADER
AT A WEAK POINT.

153
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:44,166
- YOU MIGHT BE RIGHT
I HOPE NOT.

154
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:56,166
- YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS?

155
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:59,041
I HAD TO PUSH MYSELF
AND THE EIGHT-SIX TO OUR LIMITS

156
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:01,541
AND HE HASN'T EVEN BEEN
GOING ALL OUT THIS WHOLE RACE?

157
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:06,541
- ( tires screeching )

158
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:09,666
- DAMN IT, MY TIRES ARE
PRACTICALLY WORN BALD!

159
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:22,375
I HATE TO SAY IT,
BUT THIS TIME AROUND,

160
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:24,541
I DON'T FEEL LIKE
I CAN WIN.

161
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:27,041
FEELS LIKE I'M THE PUPPET AND
THIS GUY'S GOT CONTROL

162
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:29,083
OF MY STRINGS.

163
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:32,625
MAN, WHAT THE HELL IS IT WITH ME
AND OLD GEEZERS IN FAST CARS.

164
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:34,875
IT SEEMS LIKE NO MATTER
WHAT MOVE I TRY AND MAKE,

165
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:37,583
HE'S ALWAYS ONE
STEP AHEAD OF ME.

166
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:41,166
I'VE GOT NO IDEA WHAT TO DO!
I'M FREAKIN' LOST TONIGHT!

167
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,000
- Man: I WAS CHECKING THE
TIMES UP TO THIS POINT,

168
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:48,458
AND IT LOOKS TO ME
LIKE EVERYTHING'S BEEN

169
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:49,916
AT JOSHIMA'S PACING.

170
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,875
I DON'T THINK PROJECT D
EXPECTED TO GET WORN DOWN

171
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:53,625
NEARLY AS FAR AS THEY HAVE.

172
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:56,416
- I HAVEN'T CHECKED IT, BUT I'D
THINK THE TIRES ON EIGHT-SIX

173
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,833
ARE RUNNING OUT OF RUBBER.

174
00:11:57,916 --> 00:11:59,500
ONE-HANDED STEERING
DOESN'T WEAR THEM DOWN

175
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:01,416
LIKE THE TWO-HANDED TECHNIQUE.

176
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:05,375
AND I JUST HAD ANOTHER THOUGHT.

177
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:08,791
ANYONE WHO'S CHASING JOSHIMA
WITH EVERYTHING THEY GOT

178
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:11,291
IS GONNA HAVE A HELL OF A HARD
TIME FINDING THEIR RHYTHM.

179
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:13,875
THE MORE EXPERIENCE THEY GOT,
THE MORE SURE THEY ARE

180
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:15,041
OF THEIR ABILITIES,

181
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:17,708
THE MORE CONFUSED
THEY'LL GET BEHIND HIM.

182
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,666
AT FIRST LOOK, IT DOESN'T
LOOK LIKE JOSHIMA

183
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,875
CARES ABOUT PICKING
THE RIGHT LINES.

184
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:24,000
BUT EVERYTHING HE DOES
IS CALCULATED.

185
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:26,250
IT'S ALL PERFECTLY CONTROLLED.

186
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:29,875
HE DOES WHAT HE DOES TO CONFUSE
HIS OPPONENT'S RHYTHMS.

187
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:32,375
AFTER HE GETS IN THEIR HEAD'S
HE'S MORE IN CONTROL

188
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:33,666
OF WHAT THEY DO THAN THEY ARE.

189
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,958
I'VE NEVER SEEN
ANYTHING LIKE IT BEFORE.

190
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:39,791
( sighs )

191
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:41,416
THERE'S A PART OF ME THAT
ACTUALLY FEELS SORRY

192
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,625
FOR THAT KID IN THE EIGHT-SIX.

193
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:45,041
HE'S GOT THREE WHOLE RUNS

194
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:47,541
OF WATCHING JOSHIMA'S
DRIVING UNDER HIS BELT,

195
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:49,958
HE MUST BE SWEATIN'
LIKE A WHORE IN CHURCH.

196
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:52,708
IT'S GONNA END
LIKE JOSHIMA SAID.

197
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:54,791
WE GOT ONE OR TWO
MORE RUNS LEFT.

198
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,791
- THERE'S A MULTIPLE S-CURVE OF
THE FIRST HALF OF THIS COURSE.

199
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:06,625
AT TEN TURN STRONG, IT DOESN'T
MAKE FOR AN EASY RIDE,

200
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:09,208
QUITE THE OPPOSITE.

201
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:12,000
THERE'S GOING TO BE ANY KIND OF
SWITCH-UP IN THIS BATTLE,

202
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:13,875
IT'LL BE THERE.

203
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:16,916
AND UNLESS I'M WAY OFF,
JOSHIMA WILL MAKE THE MOVE.

204
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:31,458
- HOSHINO MIGHT HAVE
POKED AT ME ABOUT IT,

205
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:33,708
BUT THERE'S A DAMN GOOD REASON
I'VE DRAGGED THIS RACE OUT

206
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:35,708
AS LONG AS I HAVE.

207
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:37,958
WATCHING THAT EIGHT-SIX
FROM BEHIND,

208
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:42,166
THE REASON IS AS CLEAR AS THE
MOON ON A CLOUDLESS NIGHT.

209
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:45,291
I CAN FINALLY TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF HIS WORN OUT TIRES.

210
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:52,166
NOT MUCH ROOM TO GIVE.
MY TIRES ARE GOING, TOO.

211
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:55,291
THEY'RE ABOUT READY TO SPLINTER.

212
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:58,000
BUT I'M GOING TO WIN THIS THING
WITH MY BRAIN.

213
00:13:58,083 --> 00:13:59,375
HOW AN ADULT DOES IT.

214
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:05,708
IT'S ON EITHER THE
EIGHTH OR NINTH TURN

215
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:07,083
OF THE MULTIPLE S-CURVE.

216
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:10,250
THERE'S A POINT WHERE
THE RHYTHM CHANGES.

217
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:12,250
IT'S SUBTLE, BUT IT'S THERE.

218
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:20,333
AND ON THE CURVE
RIGHT BEFORE THAT...

219
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:22,000
THERE!

220
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:32,833

00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:38,000
- DON'T BE DOWN
ON YOURSELF, KID.

230
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:40,958
YOU'RE NOT A BAD DRIVER.
QUITE THE OPPOSITE, IN FACT.

231
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:45,000
I MEAN, CONSIDERING THE
ABILITIES OF THE EIGHT-SIX,

232
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:48,125
YOU'VE MANAGED TO PUT UP
A HEAVYWEIGHT FIGHT.

233
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:52,166
YOU'VE GOT SKILLS, THAT MUCH
IS OBVIOUS, AND TALENT.

234
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:54,000
I HOPE YOU KEEP GOING.

235
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:55,916
KEEP YOUR EXPERIENCES
IN YOUR POCKET,

236
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,333
LEARN FROM THEM, AND GROW.

237
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:05,458
- OKAY. I UNDERSTAND, THANKS.

238
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:09,583
HEY, RYOSUKE, THEY'RE SAYING
FUJIWARA JUST GOT PASSED.

239
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:13,000
( sighs ) I GUESS
THAT'S THE END OF IT.

240
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:15,458
HE'S DONE GOOD UP TO NOW,
BUT IT'S OVER.

241
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:17,375
- THE GUY MADE A SMOOTH MOVE
AND OWNED IT.

242
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:18,791
THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT.

243
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:21,166
HE WAS IN TOTAL CONTROL
OF THE RACE UP TO THAT POINT

244
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,458
AND HELD OFF ON PASSING TILL
HE KNEW HE COULD PULL IT OFF

245
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:25,000
WITHOUT A HITCH.

246
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:27,875
YOU HAVE TO HAND IT TO HIM,
HIS TIMING WAS PERFECT.

247
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:31,333
AND IT WAS ALL DUE TO HIS
ONE-HANDED STEERING TECHNIQUE.

248
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:33,291
EVEN IF WE KNEW ALL ABOUT IT
BEFORE WE GOT HERE,

249
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:35,791
WE NEVER COULDN'T HAVE
AVOIDED THIS.

250
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:38,208
- Man: ALRIGHT, YOU DID IT!
YOU DID IT!

251
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:39,875
- ( people cheering )

252
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:44,375
- THIS FREAKIN' SUCKS, MAN!

253
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:46,500
WHAT THE HELL DOES FUJIWARA
THINK HE'S DOIN'?

254
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:47,583
KEISUKE WON THE HILL CLIMB

255
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:49,458
AND NOW HE'S SCREWING
UP THE DOWNHILL!

256
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:53,083
- HE GOT PASSED.
HAD TO HAPPEN SOONER OR LATER.

257
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:55,000
- AND NOW THERE'S NOTHING
WE CAN DO!

258
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:56,958
THERE'S NO WAY WE'RE GONNA
WIN ON THE DOWNHILL!

259
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:59,083
WE'RE TOTALLY HOSED!

260
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:01,541
- IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK?

261
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:04,166
IF THERE WAS ANYONE ELSE BEHIND
THE WHEEL OF THAT EIGHT-SIX,

262
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,333
I'D AGREE.

263
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:08,541
BUT THERE'S NOT.
THAT'S FUJIWARA DRIVING.

264
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:12,333
NO WAY TO TELL WHAT'S HE'S GONNA
TRY TO PULL NEXT.

265
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:14,375
- I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT, BUT...

266
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:20,750
- MAYBE IT'S JUST THAT
I DON'T WANT YOU TO LOSE.

267
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:23,708
IF ANYBODY DESERVES TO
SHOW YOU UP IN A BATTLE,

268
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:25,875
DAMN IT, IT'S GOT TO BE ME.

269
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,333
- JOSHIMA'S TECHNIQUE IS
SO PERFECTED THAT IT BECOMES

270
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:33,916
HARMFUL TO A DRIVER
LIKE FUJIWARA

271
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,541
WHO OPERATES MOSTLY ON INSTINCT.

272
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:37,708
THEIR TYPES DON'T
MESH WELL TOGETHER.

273
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,416
BEFORE HE KNOWS WHAT'S GOING ON,
HE'S SYNCED UP.

274
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,291
THEN HE'S PULLED ALONG
FOR THE RIDE.

275
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:44,750
I KNEW FROM THE GET-GO
THIS WOULD HAPPEN.

276
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:46,791
THERE WAS NEVER A DOUBT
IN MY MIND.

277
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:50,166
BUT NOW THE STALEMATE IS BROKEN,
PRACTICALLY ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN.

278
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:53,666
- ( gasps ) I DON'T GET IT.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, IT'S BROKEN?

279
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,958
- FUJIWARA'S FREED
FROM BEING CONTROLLED.

280
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:58,375
HE CAN REGAIN HIS OWN PACE
AND FINISH OUT THE BATTLE

281
00:17:58,458 --> 00:17:59,791
IN HIS OWN WAY.

282
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:04,833
MAY LOOK GRIM AT THE MOMENT
BUT THEY HAVEN'T BEATEN US YET.

283
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,500
- TIME TO LEAVE THIS KID
IN THE DUST.

284
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:19,291
NO POINT IN SAVING
MY TIRES ANYMORE.

285
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:21,083
I'LL USE THE REST OF MY GRIP

286
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:23,875
AND LEAVE YOU WONDERING
WHERE I WENT.

287
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:09,375
- ( crowd cheering )

288
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:16,416
- DID YOU SEE THAT? THE
EIGHT-SIX WAS BEHIND JOSHIMA.

289
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:20,875
- YEAH. IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.
HOW'D HE EVEN DO THAT?

290
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:27,791
- KEEP IN MIND, THE EIGHT-SIX
ISN'T THE ONLY CAR

291
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,291
WEARING DOWN ITS TIRES TONIGHT.

292
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:32,333
THAT S-TWO THOUSAND IS
A LITTLE HEAVIER.

293
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:34,875
THAT'LL DO ITS OWN DAMAGE.

294
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:36,458
- YOU GOT A POINT THERE.

295
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:38,791
- IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW SKILLED
YOU ARE AT MANAGING YOUR TIRES,

296
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:40,125
THERE'S A PHYSICAL LIMIT.

297
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:43,291
IT'S TRUE YOU CAN ONLY DO
SO MUCH FOR SO LONG.

298
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:46,208
THAT TIME IS GOING TO COME
FOR OUR OPPONENT AS WELL.

299
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:49,041
IT'S NOT LIKE HIS TIRES
ARE EXEMPT.

300
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:50,375
AND UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS,

301
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:53,416
THE EIGHT-SIX ACTUALLY HAS
MANY MORE ADVANTAGES.

302
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:57,833
WE KNOW THAT JOSHIMA'S
ONE-HANDED STYLE OF STEERING

303
00:19:57,916 --> 00:19:59,041
IS HIS BIG THING.

304
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:00,875
THAT'S HIS GOLDEN EGG.

305
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:02,541
BUT THE FACT THAT
HE'S SO COMFORTABLE ENOUGH

306
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:05,250
TO CONTINUE DRIVING WITH
ONE HAND MEANS ONE THING.

307
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:06,833
THAT AS HARD AS
TAKUMI'S BEEN TRYING

308
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:07,916
TO THROW HIM OFF HIS GAME,

309
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
HE'S STILL SQUARELY
IN HIS ELEMENT.

310
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,500
- OKAY, BUT WHAT'S YOUR POINT?

311
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:13,375
- WHEN SOMETHING JARRING
HAPPENS IN A RACE,

312
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:16,291
MOST DRIVERS INSTINCTIVELY
GRAB THE WHEEL WITH BOTH HANDS.

313
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:19,250
MY POINT IS THAT HE'S CONFIDENT
THAT NOTHING LIKE THAT

314
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:21,291
WOULD EVER HAPPEN TO HIM
WHILE HE'S IN THIS BATTLE.

315
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:25,041
- COOL, I GET
WHAT YOU'RE SAYIN'.

316
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:28,125
- WHEN RACING, THIS GUY CAN
INTUIT WHAT'S COMIN' UP NEXT.

317
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:30,083
THAT'S WHY IT APPEARS HE
KNOW HOW TO PREDICT

318
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:32,291
EXACTLY WHAT'S
AROUND EACH CORNER.

319
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:35,208
HE'S CONFIDENT THAT EVERYTHING
WILL GO HIS WAY.

320
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:38,125
THAT ALLOWS HIM TO USE
HIS ONE-HANDED STEERING.

321
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:40,125
WE HAVE TO BREAK
THAT CONFIDENCE.

322
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:41,583
WE CAN'T AFFORD TO LOSE.

323
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:42,750
AND NOW THAT WE KNOW THIS

324
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:45,083
WE CERTAINLY CAN'T AFFORD
TO DO NOTHING.

325
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:47,625
IF WE CAN'T CREATE A SITUATION
THAT FORCES THE ISSUE,

326
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:49,125
SOMETHING THAT SCARES HIM
TO THE POINT

327
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:51,208
THAT HE GRABS THE WHEEL
WITH BOTH HANDS,

328
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,125
WE WON'T BE ABLE TO
CREATE AN OPENING.

329
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:57,625
WE MIGHT BE ABLE
TO EDGE HIM OUT,

330
00:20:57,708 --> 00:20:59,625
BUT WE'LL NEED TO
GET INSIDE HIS HEAD

331
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:02,750
THE SAME WAY HE TRIED TO
FORCE HIS WAY INTO TAKUMI'S.

332
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:04,666
WE JUST HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW.

333
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:32,125
- IMPOSSIBLE. THERE'S HARDLY
ANY DISTANCE BETWEEN US!

334
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:53,583
HOW IS THIS HAPPENING? WHAT ARE
YOU DOING BACK THERE, KID?

335
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:01,541
- THERE'S NO NEED
TO MATCH HIS PACE.

336
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:03,291
JUST RELAX AND DO YOU OWN THING.

337
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:05,833
YOUR BEST SHOT IS TO
TAKE THE COUNTER-OFFENSIVE.

338
00:22:05,916 --> 00:22:07,375
YOU SHOULD'VE ALREADY
NOTICED THAT YOU CAN USE

339
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:08,875
THE GUTTERS AND HEDGES
ON THIS COURSE.

340
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:11,708
YOU NEED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF THAT WHEN YOU CAN.

341
00:22:11,791 --> 00:22:14,000
I DON'T THINK I NEED TO REMIND
YOU OF EVERYTHING PROJECT D

342
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:15,875
HAS RIDING ON THIS.

343
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:33,666
- THERE IT IS.
THAT'S WHAT HE'S GUNNING FOR.

344
00:22:45,583 --> 00:22:48,250
HE'S GONE. BUT HOW?

345
00:23:02,875 --> 00:23:04,125
WHAT THE HELL?

346
00:23:04,208 --> 00:23:06,875
- ♪ I JUST WANNA BE
THE ONE FOR YOU ♪

347
00:23:06,958 --> 00:23:10,291
♪ I JUST WANNA BE THE ONE

348
00:23:24,208 --> 00:23:25,833

349
00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:31,166
- ♪ GIVE ME A SIGN

350

351
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:37,333
- WAIT. I'M GOING CRAZY.
OR DID I JUST SEE THAT?

352
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,250
- I DON'T KNOW ABOUT
YOU BUT I JUST SAW

353
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:46,333
A SECOND SET OF HEADLIGHTS
POP UP OUTTA FREAKIN' NOWHERE.

354
00:23:46,416 --> 00:23:48,916
- DAMN IT! I LOSE SIGHT OF HIM
FOR ONE SECOND

355
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,250
AND SUDDENLY THE KID COMES AT ME
FROM THE SHARPEST ANGLE

356
00:23:51,333 --> 00:23:52,708
HE CAN EVEN ATTEMPT.

357
00:23:52,791 --> 00:23:56,291
NOW THAT'S A GOD-LIKE
DRIVING TECHNIQUE.

358
00:23:56,375 --> 00:23:58,041
I HAD AN IDEA
HE WAS CORNERING

359
00:23:58,125 --> 00:23:59,791
BY USING THE GUTTERS
BY THE HEDGES,

360
00:23:59,875 --> 00:24:01,958
BUT I DECIDED I MUST BE CRAZY,

361
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:05,333
IT'S SUCH AN INCREDIBLY
RISKY TECHNIQUE.

362
00:24:05,416 --> 00:24:07,958
IF HE MISSED HIS TIMING BY
EVEN A FRACTION OF A SECOND,

363
00:24:08,041 --> 00:24:10,958
HE'D LOSE CONTROL AND
CRASH INTO THE MOUNTAIN.

364
00:24:11,041 --> 00:24:13,291
AND MY CAR'S BEEN LOWERED
AS FAR AS IT CAN,

365
00:24:13,375 --> 00:24:16,416
SO I COULDN'T COPY HIS MOVE
EVEN IF I WANTED TO.

366
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:19,208
WHAT HE'S DOING IS
TAILOR-MADE FOR AN OLDER CAR

367
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:23,000
WITHOUT ANYTHING HANGING FROM
ITS UNDERCARRIAGE. WELL PLAYED.

368
00:24:24,875 --> 00:24:26,250
- I DON'T KNOW HOW TO
TELL YOU THIS,

369
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:29,583
BUT JOSHIMA JUST GOT PASSED.

370
00:24:29,666 --> 00:24:33,833
- YOU MEAN THAT DOCTOR GOD FOOT
TOUSHIMO WAS BEATEN BY SOME KID?

371
00:24:33,916 --> 00:24:35,333
- IT'S LIKE I WAS TELLIN' YOU.

372
00:24:35,416 --> 00:24:38,291
WE GOT NO IDEA WHAT'LL
HAPPEN IN THIS BATTLE.

373
00:24:38,375 --> 00:24:40,750
