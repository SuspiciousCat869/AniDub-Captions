1
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:12,375
- ( theme song playing )

2
00:00:27,416 --> 00:00:29,125
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:51,958 --> 00:01:54,625
- HEY, TAKUMI! YOU OFF TODAY?

4
00:01:54,708 --> 00:01:55,625
- OH, YEAH.

5
00:01:55,708 --> 00:01:58,458
- TAKUMI! IT'S
FINALLY HAPPENING!

6
00:01:58,541 --> 00:02:00,125
- WHAT'S GOT YOU SO WORKED UP?

7
00:02:00,208 --> 00:02:03,208
- OH, C'MON YOU KNOW!
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE LEVIN!

8
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:05,041
BABY'S GETTING FITTED
WITH A TURBO!

9
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:07,333
- NO KIDDING?

10
00:02:07,416 --> 00:02:10,500
- I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU,
SHE'S IN THE SHOP AS WE SPEAK.

11
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:12,875
THIS IS TOTALLY GONNA
KICK ALL KINDS OF ASS!

12
00:02:12,958 --> 00:02:14,291
- WAIT, LET ME GET
THIS STRAIGHT.

13
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:15,791
THAT TURTLE-BUCKET
OF YOURS MIGHT GET

14
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:17,958
FROM POINT A TO B
WITHOUT BREAKING DOWN?

15
00:02:18,041 --> 00:02:20,958
- IS THAT FEAR I DETECT?
OH, JUST YOU WAIT AND SEE.

16
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:23,625
WITH THE TURBO INSTALLED
THAT PUPPY'LL HIT 180 HORSEPOWER

17
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:25,166
LIKE IT WAS NOTHING.

18
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:26,500
THE DAYS OF ME
FALLING BEHIND YOU

19
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:27,875
AND YOUR FLASHY
LITTLE S-THIRTEEN

20
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:29,875
ON THE HILL CLIMB ARE OVER,
MY FRIEND!

21
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:31,166
( laughs )

22
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,750
- 180, HUH?

23
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:35,416
TURBOS ARE GREAT
AND ALL, SURE, BUT...

24
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,166
- Iketani: AH, LET HIM DREAM...

25
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,583
SO MR. ALL-STAR,

26
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:41,541
KENJI TELLS ME YOU'VE GOT
BEATING THE TOUDOU SCHOOL

27
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:42,666
UNDER YOUR BELT NOW.

28
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:45,833
- YEAH, I GUESS I DO.

29
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:48,208
- I HEAR KEISUKE SLAUGHTERED
EVERYONE ON THE HILL CLIMB,

30
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:49,666
BUT IT WAS YOUR PERFECTLY
TIMED ATTACKS

31
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,166
THAT REALLY SEALED THE DEAL.

32
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:54,000
SOUNDS TO ME LIKE THOSE POOR
GUYS DIDN'T STAND A CHANCE.

33
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:55,291
WAY TO GO, PROJECT D.

34
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,333
- WITH MY NEW 8-5 TURBO,
IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME

35
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:01,333
BEFORE THEY'RE
BEGGING ME TO JOIN!

36
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:04,583
- (laughs ) NOW THAT
I'D LIKE TO SEE.

37
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:09,666
- ( tires screeching )

38
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:12,333
- TOMOYUKI.

39
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,666
- WORD ON THE STREET IS
YOU TWO GOT DUSTED.

40
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:19,416
HOW DID IT GO DOWN?
I WANT DETAILS.

41
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:31,291
- IN A WAY, THEY NEEDED TO LOSE.

42
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:34,250
NOTHING KEEPS A TEAM FOCUSED
LIKE A GOOD DOSE OF HUMILITY.

43
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:36,208
OF COURSE THAT'S ASSUMING
THEY GET THE LESSON.

44
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:39,458
HOWEVER GOOD YOU ARE,
THERE'S ALWAYS GONNA BE

45
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:42,333
ANOTHER WALL AROUND THE CORNER,
JUST WAITIN' TO BE HIT.

46
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:44,500
DAIKI AND SAKAI
FOUND THAT OUT THE HARD WAY

47
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:46,666
AFTER RACING PROJECT D
THE OTHER NIGHT.

48
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:53,125
THE TRICK IS NOT TO GET
TOO COMFORTABLE.

49
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:54,958
WHEN YOU LOSE, YOU'VE GOTTA
SWALLOW YOUR PRIDE

50
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:56,000
AND LEARN FROM IT.

51
00:03:56,083 --> 00:04:00,166
YOU'LL FIND YOUR LIMIT.
WE ALL DO.

52
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,208
I GOTTA TELL YOU THOUGH, KID,

53
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:03,958
I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN HITTIN'
YOUR WALL LATELY,

54
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:06,000
BUT I'M JUST NOT CONVINCED
THAT IT'S SOMETHING

55
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:09,291
YOU WON'T BE ABLE GET OVER.

56
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:12,625
- WAIT A SEC. YOU KNOW ABOUT ALL
THE CRAP I'VE BEEN DEALING WITH?

57
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:14,375
- I CAN SEE IT IN THE WAY
YOU'RE DRIVING.

58
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:16,958
HELL IF I COULDN'T I'D HARDLY
BE CHIEF OF THE TOUDOU SCHOOL.

59
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:18,625
IT'S NOT ROCKET SCIENCE.

60
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:21,458
- WHAT CAN I SAY?
THINGS HAVE BEEN ROUGH.

61
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:24,166
IT FEELS LIKE PROFESSIONAL
RACING IS ALL ABOUT FUNDING

62
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,083
AND SPONSORSHIP NOW.

63
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:30,125
IT'S HARD ENOUGH TO STAY FOCUSED
AND KEEP YOUR TEAM'S MORALE UP

64
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:33,416
WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT FINDING
A BACKER IN THIS DAMN RECESSION.

65
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,541
I LET IT GET TO ME WHEN MY MIND
SHOULD BE ON THE COURSE.

66
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:38,583
I LOSE GROUND
ON THE STRAIGHTAWAYS,

67
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:40,416
AND THEN I END UP LEAVING
MYSELF OPEN TO MAKE MISTAKES

68
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,666
EVEN A ROOKIE WOULDN'T MAKE.

69
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,875
I'M LOSING MY PASSION FOR
THE RACE BECAUSE OF IT,

70
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:47,166
THE WHOLE THING'S BECOMING
A VICIOUS CYCLE.

71
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,833
MAYBE I HAVE FINALLY HIT A WALL

72
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:50,583
THAT I WON'T BE
ABLE TO OVERCOME.

73
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:52,958
- NO OFFENSE, BUT
IF THAT WERE TRUE,

74
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:55,458
I DOUBT YOU'D TAKE IT LYING
DOWN LIKE THIS.

75
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:57,208
- HUH?

76
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:59,458
- PROBLEM IS YOU CAN'T SEE THE
FOREST FOR THE TREES RIGHT NOW,

77
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:01,541
KID, YOU NEED A DISTRACTION.

78
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:02,791
- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

79
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:05,666
- YOU KNOW, A STREET RACE
MIGHT DO YOU GOOD.

80
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,250
WHY NOT GIVE IT A SHOT?

81
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:09,125
- THERE'S NO WAY YOU'RE
SERIOUS ABOUT THAT.

82
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:11,250
I MEAN, WEREN'T YOU
THE ONE WHO TOLD THAT ME

83
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:13,250
ONCE I TURNED PRO I SHOULDN'T
RISK HURTING MY REPUTATION

84
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:14,708
BY TAKING PART IN A STREET RACE?

85
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:17,000
- SOMETIMES THE RISK
IS WORTH IT.

86
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:19,583
TAKE ON AN AMATEUR AND SEE
WHAT IT DOES FOR YOUR FOCUS.

87
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:20,833
IF YOU GET CAUGHT,

88
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:23,166
YOU CAN ALWAYS TELL THE
SPONSORS HE TRICKED YOU.

89
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:26,208
HEY, WE ALL GOTTA CUT LOOSE
EVERY NOW AND THEN, RIGHT?

90
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:41,958
- WELL?

91
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:44,333
- IT'S ACTUALLY BALANCED
PRETTY WELL.

92
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:46,041
I WASN'T HARD ON THE ENGINE,

93
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:48,083
BUT COMPARED TO WHEN WE FIRST
GOT IT INSTALLED

94
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:50,250
THE DOWNHILLS ARE A BREEZE.

95
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:52,041
IT'S NOT THE BEST CAR
IN THE WORLD

96
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:55,750
BUT IT CAN STILL IMPRESS YOU
WHEN IT'S TUNED RIGHT.

97
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:58,583
AND I'M SURE IT'S MADE RACING
A HELL OF A LOT EASIER FOR YOU.

98
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:02,916
WELL MAYBE, BUT THE PEOPLE I'M
UP AGAINST KEEP GETTING BETTER.

99
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,125
SOONER OR LATER THIS WINNING
STREAK IS GONNA BREAK.

100
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:06,208
I CAN'T KEEP IT UP.

101
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:14,833
- NATURALLY, LOSING'S NOT THE
END OF THE WORLD, YOU KNOW.

102
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,583
MIGHT EVEN TEACH YOU
A THING OR TWO.

103
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:19,833
- TEACH ME? COME ON, DAD.
IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.

104
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:21,708
I'VE TEAMMATES TO THINK ABOUT.

105
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:25,500
I CAN'T JUST LOSE
FOR THE SAKE OF LOSING.

106
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:27,541
- PUSHING YOURSELF TO THE
LIMIT MEANS BEING READY

107
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:29,666
AND WILLING TO ACCEPT
WHAT THAT LIMIT IS.

108
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,083
NO MATTER HOW WELL-TUNED,

109
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:33,375
EVEN THE BEST CAR IS BOUND BY
THE SAME LAWS OF PHYSICS

110
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:35,250
AS EVERY OTHER
CAR ON THE ROAD.

111
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:36,625
- OF COURSE IT IS, BUT WHAT...

112
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:38,625
- JUST TRY TO MAINTAIN
SOME PERSPECTIVE.

113
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:39,750
THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING.

114
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:45,333
YOU KNOW, IT'S KINDA FUNNY, FOR
A CAR THAT'S ONLY HALF YOURS,

115
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:47,916
YOU SURE GET A LOT MORE USE
OUT OF IT THAN ME.

116
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,250
ALL I EVER SEEM TO DO LATELY
IS WORK ON THE DAMN THING.

117
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:53,833
MAYBE IT'S TIME FOR ME
TO CONSIDER BUYING A NEW ONE.

118
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:55,875
- YOU'RE JOKING.

119
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:57,375
- I'M PRETTY SURE IF I PLAYED
MY CARDS RIGHT,

120
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:59,791
MASASHI WOULD GET ME
A GOOD DEAL ON SOMETHING FUN.

121
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:02,416
- JUST WHAT KIND OF "FUN"
DO YOU HAVE IN MIND, EXACTLY?

122
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:05,541
- THAT'S FOR ME TO KNOW.

123
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,458
- Keisuke: HEADS UP, BRO.
I'M COMING IN.

124
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:14,583
- Ryosuke: ALRIGHT.

125
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:18,416
- GOOD MORNING.

126
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,541
SO IS IT TRUE WHAT I HEAR
ABOUT THE TOUDOU GUYS

127
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:21,791
WANTING ANOTHER RACE?

128
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:22,916
- ONE OF THEIR GRADUATES.

129
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,666
- SERIOUSLY?

130
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:25,791
- YEAH.

131
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:26,916
- WE'RE ON, RIGHT?

132
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:33,916
- ( phone ringing )

133
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,041
- Kyoichi: RYOSUKE...

134
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:36,750
- Ryosuke: SPEAKING.

135
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:38,208
- THIS IS KYOICHI.

136
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,666
- AH. TO WHAT DO I OWE
THE PLEASURE?

137
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:43,750
- I KNOW ONE OF THEIR "ALUMNI"
HAS CHALLENGED PROJECT D

138
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:45,708
TO A REMATCH ON BEHALF OF
THE TOEDOE SCHOOL.

139
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:49,125
TAKE MY ADVICE
AND DON'T ACCEPT IT.

140
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:50,916
I KNOW THAT'S ASKING
THE IMPOSSIBLE,

141
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,833
BUT JUST HEAR ME
OUT FOR A SECOND.

142
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:55,791
THIS GUY, THE ONE WHO'S
ASKING FOR THE REMATCH...

143
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,083
HE'S A PROFESSIONAL.

144
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:01,833
NAME'S TOMOYUKI TACHI,
AND HE'S MORE THAN A CUT ABOVE

145
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:05,125
WHAT YOU'D EXPECT
FROM TOUDOU, BELIEVE ME.

146
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:08,791
BOTTOM LINE, LOOKS TO ME
LIKE YOU GUYS ARE BEING SET UP.

147
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:10,416
IF IT'S TOO LATE TO
BACK OUT OF THE RACE,

148
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,583
I RECOMMEND YOU TAKE
HIM ON PERSONALLY.

149
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:15,458
IT'S THE ONLY WAY.

150
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:17,583
IF PROJECT D HAS ANY
SHOT AT WINNING,

151
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:18,791
IT'S GONNA HAVE TO BE YOU

152
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:21,333
BEHIND THE WHEEL
WHEN THAT COUNTDOWN STARTS.

153
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:22,541
YOU KNOW I'M RIGHT.

154
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:27,125
- ( engine revving )

155
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:50,208
- WHOA, THE TOUDOU SCHOOL'S
LATEST DEMONSTRATION CAR

156
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:52,250
ALREADY FLIES LIKE
A BAT OUT OF HELL,

157
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:54,291
BUT WITH TOMOYUKI DRIVING
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

158
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:56,166
- NO KIDDING, RIGHT?

159
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,250
I'M GETTING' GOOSEBUMPS
JUST STANDING HERE.

160
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:00,125
CAN YOU IMAGINE RIDING
SHOTGUN IN THAT THING

161
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:01,833
WHILE HE RACES PROJECT D?

162
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,833
HE AND THAT CAR
WERE MADE FOR EACH OTHER.

163
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:05,333
IT'S LIKE WE COULD RACE
OUR WHOLE LIVES

164
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:07,916
AND NEVER GET ANYWHERE NEAR
THE ZONE HE'S IN RIGHT NOW.

165
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,458
- IT'LL BE EPIC.

166
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:11,166
EVEN IF I WASN'T IN THIS
TO SEE PROJECT D

167
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,666
TAKEN DOWN A FEW NOTCHES,

168
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,166
I'D CONSIDER MYSELF LUCKY
TO SEE HOW THIS RACE SHAPES UP.

169
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:17,833
I MEAN, JUST THINK ABOUT IT.

170
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:19,375
WHEN ARE ANY OF US
EVER GONNA SEE

171
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,125
A BAD-ASS LIKE TOMOYUKI TACHI

172
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:23,416
TAKE PART IN A FULL-ON
STREET RACE AGAIN?

173
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,458
- SO HOW'S SHE RUN?

174
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,333
- IT'S OKAY I GUESS.

175
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:45,041
THERE AREN'T ANY PROBLEMS THAT
ARE REALLY WORTH MENTIONING.

176
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:48,041
FROM HERE ON OUT, IT'S JUST
A QUESTION OF DETAILS.

177
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:51,208
ALL WE NEED TO DO NOW IS TUNE
THE CAR TO MY PREFERENCES.

178
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:53,666
HEY, JUST GIVE ME THE WORD
AND SHE'LL FIT YOU LIKE A GLOVE.

179
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:54,750
TELL ME WHAT YOU NEED.

180
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:57,000
- OH, I DUNNO.

181
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:59,958
LOOK, I DON'T GET WHY WE EVEN
NEED TO BOTHER WITH FINE-TUNING

182
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:02,666
WHEN MY OPPONENT'S
JUST AN AMATEUR.

183
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,833
I MEAN WE'RE ONLY TALKIN'
ABOUT A STREET RACE HERE.

184
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,333
- A STREET RACE IS STILL A RACE.

185
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:10,291
DON'T GO THINKING OF THIS AS
SOME QUAINT LITTLE EXERCISE.

186
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:12,958
IF YOU'RE GONNA DO THIS,
DO IT RIGHT.

187
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:15,000
LEAVE THE PROFESSIONAL
ARENA BEHIND FOR NOW

188
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:17,166
AND FOCUS ON WHAT'S
IN FRONT OF YOU.

189
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,625
WHEN YOU'RE UP AGAINST
THESE GUYS,

190
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:21,250
I WANT YOU TO DRIVE LIKE
THE RACE IS ALL THAT MATTERS.

191
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,958
- ALRIGHT, CHIEF,
SINCE YOU PUT IT THAT WAY

192
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:29,125
I DO HAVE ONE REQUEST.

193
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:31,083
IF YOU REALLY WANT THE
TOUDOU DEMONSTRATION CAR

194
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:32,750
TO FIT ME LIKE A GLOVE,

195
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:34,875
THEN YOU CAN START BY TWEAKING
THE SUSPENSION.

196
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:36,416
LET'S MAKE IT SO THE
REAR SWINGS OUT MORE

197
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,208
WHEN I'M TAKING A CORNER.

198
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:39,750
NOT A WHOLE HELLUVA LOT.

199
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:42,500
JUST ENOUGH TO IMPROVE
MY TIMING A LITTLE BIT.

200
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:45,708
THAT'S NO PROBLEM.
I'LL GIVE YOU WHAT YOU NEED.

201
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:46,791
- ( gasps )

202
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:55,041
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

203
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:57,083
SHE LOOKS LIKE A TOTALLY
DIFFERENT CAR NOW.

204
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:59,000
ALL THAT FROM JUST
REPLACING THE HOOD.

205
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:02,416
RYOSUKE TOLD US
TO MAKE IT LIGHT.

206
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,083
SO, LITTLE BY LITTLE, THAT'S
EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO.

207
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:09,250
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT, THIS BABY'LL
FLOAT LIKE A HOT-AIR BALLOON.

208
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:11,458
- Ryosuke: OKAY EVERYONE.
LET'S GET STARTED.

209
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,791
THIS IS FOOTAGE OF THE COURSE
WE'LL BE RUNNING,

210
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:18,750
RECORDED EARLIER TODAY.

211
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:20,375
YOU'LL UNDERSTAND
ONCE YOU'VE WATCHED IT,

212
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:22,875
BUT THE MIX OF UPHILL AND
DOWNHILL SECTIONS ON THIS THING

213
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:25,208
PRESENTS AN INTERESTING
CHALLENGE, TO SAY THE LEAST.

214
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:28,083
- THIS SOUNDS LIKE FUN.

215
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:30,875
SO HAVE YOU DECIDED YET WHICH
ONE OF US ACTUALLY GETS TO RACE?

216
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:33,875
- NOT JUST YET.
YOU'LL BOTH RUN THE COURSE.

217
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:35,666
AND I'LL MAKE UP MY MIND THEN.

218
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,958
WE'RE ALL HEADING OUT THERE
NEXT, SO GET READY.

219
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:41,333
WHAT THE HELL
IS HE TALKING ABOUT?

220
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:43,291
I'M THE OBVIOUS CHOICE.

221
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:45,666
WHAT, WE GOTTA
"AUDITION" NOW?

222
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,666
- THIS RACE IS AN IMPORTANT ONE.

223
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:51,083
FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS,
NOT LEAST OF WHICH,

224
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:52,583
WE'RE RACING TOUDOU AGAIN.

225
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:53,666
- ( both gasp )

226
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,208
- THAT'S RIGHT.

227
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:57,166
AND ON TOP OF THAT, THEY'VE
BROUGHT IN A PROFESSIONAL.

228
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:01,666
- WHOA. A PROFESSIONAL?
NO WAY.

229
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:05,000
- BUT RYOSUKE, WITH
ALL DUE RESPECT, WE CAN'T.

230
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:06,625
WE'RE IN WAY OVER
OUR HEADS HERE.

231
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:08,250
WE'RE WALKING RIGHT INTO A TRAP.

232
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:11,333
- THIS IS CRAZY!
WHAT THE HELL ARE WE GONNA DO?

233
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:14,041
- WE'RE GONNA TREAT
THIS RACE LIKE ANY OTHER.

234
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:17,083
NOTHING'S WRITTEN IN STONE.
WE STILL HAVE A CHANCE.

235
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:20,125
BESIDES, THIS IS PROJECT D.

236
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:23,083
WE DON'T BACK DOWN,
NO MATTER WHO OUR OPPONENT IS.

237
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:24,666
THAT'S OUR MOTTO.

238
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,666
- DAMN RIGHT.
LET ME TAKE THIS GUY ON.

239
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:30,583
IF THIS COURSE IS THE CRAZY MIX
OF UPS AND DOWNS YOU SAY IT IS,

240
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:33,041
THE FD'S TORQUE HAS
THE ADVANTAGE, NO QUESTION.

241
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:34,666
I SHOULD BE THE ONE
WHO REPRESENTS US.

242
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,333
- Kenta: HE'S RIGHT!

243
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:38,333
- YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M GETTING
SICK OF HAVING TO REPEAT MYSELF.

244
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:42,916
I'LL DECIDE WHO RACES
ONCE I'VE SEEN YOU AND TAKUMI

245
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,833
DO YOUR PRACTICE RUNS.

246
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:00,208
- Daiki: TOMOYUKI.

247
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:01,708
- OH, IT'S YOU.

248
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:03,000
- I HEAR THE GUYS IN PROJECT D

249
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:04,333
ARE PLANNING ON
RUNNING THE COURSE

250
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:06,916
A FEW TIMES TONIGHT TO PREPARE,
SO IF YOU WANTED,

251
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,208
WE CAN GO AND CHECK OUT
HOW THEY HANDLE IT.

252
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,541
THEY'LL PROBABLY
DRIVE THE COURSE 'TIL DAWN

253
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,291
AND TUNE THEIR
CARS ACCORDINGLY. SO...

254
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:16,083
- THEY'RE JUST KIDS
WITH TOYS, DAIKI.

255
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:19,375
KIDS PRETENDING TO BE
PROFESSIONAL DRIVERS

256
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:22,000
BY DOING THE SAME STUFF WE DO
THE NIGHT BEFORE A BIG RACE.

257
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:24,791
MAN, THIS IS INSANE.

258
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:26,750
I'M UP AGAINST A BUNCH OF PUNKS
WHO WOULDN'T KNOW A REAL DRIVER

259
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:27,625
IF HE HIT THEM.

260
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:29,541
WHAT WAS THE
CHIEF THINKING?

261
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:31,250
- I GUESS HE'S SETTING ME
UP FOR A SURE THING

262
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:32,666
TO BOOST MY CONFIDENCE
OR SOMETHING,

263
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,625
BUT WHAT'S THE POINT IF I
KNOW ABOUT IT?

264
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:37,666
I MEAN, REALLY,
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

265
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,291
- BETWEEN YOU AND ME,

266
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:42,666
I'M ONLY DOING THIS BECAUSE
CHIEF ASKED ME TO, SO...

267
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,666
I DON'T EXPECT MUCH
OUT OF THIS RACE EXCEPT

268
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,958
A CHANCE TO KICK BACK AND
PUT SOME DUMBASS POSERS

269
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:48,375
IN THEIR PLACE.

270
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:50,125
DON'T THINK FOR A SECOND
I'M GONNA HOLD BACK

271
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:53,458
JUST BECAUSE I'M
RACING SOME AMATEUR.

272
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:56,041
WANNA SEE HOW BIG A GAP
THERE IS BETWEEN GUYS LIKE YOU

273
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:57,458
AND GUYS LIKE ME?

274
00:13:57,541 --> 00:13:59,125
WATCH WHAT I DO
TOMORROW NIGHT.

275
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,583
- THE TRICK WITH THIS COURSE
IS THAT IT COMBINES SEVERAL

276
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:14,875
DIFFERENT CONDITIONS
PRETTY SEAMLESSLY.

277
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:17,666
THE CAR AND YOUR TECHNIQUE WILL
HAVE TO BE IN PERFECT BALANCE,

278
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,583
NOTHING LESS THAN YOUR BEST
WILL GET YOU THROUGH.

279
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:25,041
WE'LL START OUT LIKE WE DID
BEFORE BY KEEPING 80%, ALRIGHT?

280
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:26,958
THIS ISN'T THE TOUDOU SCHOOL'S
REGULAR COURSE,

281
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:28,375
BUT KEEP IN MIND
SINCE THEY'VE DRIVEN IT

282
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:30,541
MORE TIMES THAN WE HAVE,
THE ADVANTAGE IS THEIRS.

283
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:32,250
SO STAY FOCUSED.

284
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,666
- HE'S ON FIRE TONIGHT.
HOT DAMN.

285
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,083
- YEAH, NO KIDDING.

286
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:54,125
- KEEP IN MIND THIS ISN'T
THE RACE, SO TAKE IT EASY.

287
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:56,791
DON'T THINK ABOUT WHETHER YOU'LL
BE THE ONE REPRESENTING US

288
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:58,666
TOMORROW NIGHT AND JUST TAKE
THE COURSE AT FACE VALUE.

289
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,250
- RIGHT.

290
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:03,083
- IT'S LIKE I ALWAYS TELL YOU...
YOUR ONLY OPPONENT IS THE ROAD.

291
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:06,208
- LET'S DO THIS.

292
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:11,416
- HEY, RYOSUKE...

293
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:13,875
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU?

294
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:16,625
YOU HARDLY EVER SCOUT OUT
THE COURSE FIRST ON YOUR OWN.

295
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:18,666
AND ON TOP OF THAT,
BRINGING THE FC?

296
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:19,666
I MEAN, C'MON.

297
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,125
- TAKE MY WORD FOR IT,

298
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:24,125
THERE'S NO HIDDEN MEANING
BEHIND MY BRINGING THE FC.

299
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:25,458
EVERY NOW AND AGAIN
I JUST LIKE TO

300
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:28,666
FEEL OUT THE COURSE FOR
MYSELF, YOU KNOW?

301
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,291
BUT, THEN AGAIN I...

302
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:31,666
- WHAT?

303
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:34,250
- I'M JUST A LITTLE
CONFUSED RIGHT NOW, THAT'S ALL.

304
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:39,458
FUMIHIRO, I'D LIKE YOU TO TAKE
COMMAND FOR THE NEXT FEW HOURS.

305
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:41,041
WE'RE JUST GOING THROUGH
THE MOTIONS ANYWAY.

306
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:42,541
THERE'S SHOULDN'T BE
ANY PROBLEMS.

307
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:45,333
- BUT, WHY? WHAT WILL YOU
BE DOING IN THE MEANTIME?

308
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:46,833
- SLEEPING.

309
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:48,708
- WHAT? WAIT...

310
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:51,125
- IT JUST HIT ME I HAVEN'T
SLEPT IN LIKE THREE DAYS

311
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:52,750
THANKS TO THAT
CLINICAL MEDICINE REPORT

312
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:54,125
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO WRITE.

313
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:55,583
IT'S A WONDER I WAS ALERT ENOUGH

314
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:57,958
TO DRIVE HERE IN
THE FIRST PLACE.

315
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,541
HOLD DOWN THE FORT FOR ME, HUH?

316
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:21,375
- THAT'S WHAT HE MEANS.

317
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:23,041
THE UPS AND DOWNS
ARE STEEP AS HELL,

318
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:24,500
AND THE CORNERS ARE
ALL TOO DIFFERENT

319
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,500
TO GET A GOOD RHYTHM GOING.

320
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,666
RYOSUKE WAS RIGHT WHEN HE SAID
NOTHING LESS THAN MY BEST

321
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,250
WILL GET ME THROUGH.

322
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:44,166
IF I SHOW HIM I'VE GOT
THIS ONE IN THE BAG,

323
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,666
IT'LL MEAN THE CHANCE
TO GO HEAD-TO-HEAD

324
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,166
WITH A BONA FIDE PROFESSIONAL.

325
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,250
YOU BET YOUR ASS
I'M GONNA STAY FOCUSED!

326
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,916
- Fumihiro: I WONDER HOW THIS
IS ALL GOING TO TURN OUT.

327
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
TO BE HONEST,
I'M GETTING A LITTLE WORRIED.

328
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:59,500
- WHAT, YOU? WORRIED? NO WAY.

329
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:02,166
- DON'T START WITH THAT.

330
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:05,083
LOOK, SOMETHING IS WRONG,
TRUST ME.

331
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:07,958
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME THE BOSS
HAS PULLED SOMETHING LIKE THIS?

332
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:10,416
YEAH, WELL...

333
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,291
HE'S PROBABLY ALREADY
MADE UP HIS MIND

334
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:14,583
NOT TO GO WITH THE 8-6
ON THIS COURSE.

335
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:16,666
- HMM. I WAS THINKING
THE SAME THING.

336
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:22,833
WHAT'S GOING ON
IN THAT HEAD OF YOURS, RYOSUKE?

337
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,625
NAH. IT CAN'T BE.

338
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:49,375
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS. CLOSE HER UP.

339
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:53,000
- THAT OUGHTA DO IT, MAN.
SHE'S ALL YOURS.

340
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:55,208
- COOL. THANKS.

341
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:56,458
- ( engine starting )

342
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,625
- MAN, I'M SORE AS HELL.

343
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:18,916
SLEEPING IN A CAR DOESN'T DO
WONDERS FOR YOUR BACK

344
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,500
OR YOUR NERVES, EITHER.

345
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:23,458
- RYOSUKE SURE DIDN'T HAVE ANY
TROUBLE CATCHING UP ON HIS Z'S.

346
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:26,541
THE MAN'S MORE AT HOME IN A CAR
THAN HE IS IN HIS OWN BED.

347
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:28,666
( chuckles ) I THINK IT'S SWEET.

348
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,125
- HOW CAN YOU SIT THERE
AND SMILE?

349
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:32,625
THIS ISN'T FUNNY, MAN.

350
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:35,291
AFTER LAST NIGHT'S PRACTICE RUN
I UNDERSTAND BETTER THAN EVER

351
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:37,041
JUST HOW IMPORTANT
RYOSUKE'S PRESENCE

352
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:39,666
REALLY IS FOR PROJECT D.

353
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,833
HE'S NOT JUST THE BRAINS
BEHIND WHAT WE DO,

354
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:44,125
HE'S THE INSPIRATION, AND FOR
HIM TO CHECK OUT LIKE THAT MEANS

355
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:46,666
SOMETHING HAS GOT TO BE
REALLY WRONG.

356
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,166
YOU WERE THERE.

357
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,333
TRY TO TELL ME WE WEREN'T FLYING
BY THE SEAT OF OUR PANTS.

358
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:53,208
IT'S NOT LIKE HIM TO BE
SO NONCHALANT, YOU KNOW?

359
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,041
I DON'T KNOW.

360
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:58,250
I HATE TO SAY THIS, BUT
I THINK IT MEANS THE WORST.

361
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:00,458
DUDE, WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

362
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:03,208
KEEP THIS TO YOURSELF, OKAY.
IT'S LIKE THIS...

363
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:04,583
IT'S JUST THAT...

364
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:06,583
I FEEL LIKE THE BOSS HAS
BACKED HIMSELF INTO A CORNER

365
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:08,666
HE CAN'T THINK HIS WAY OUT OF.

366
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:11,166
WHAT IF HE'S GONE OVER EVERY
POSSIBLE STRATEGY IN HIS HEAD

367
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:14,250
ONLY TO FIGURE OUT THAT THERE'S
NO WAY WE CAN POSSIBLY WIN?

368
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:25,541
- Matsumoto: GOOD WORK, GUYS.

369
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:27,166
TWO HOURS TO SPARE
BEFORE THE RACE

370
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:30,250
AND ALL THE TWEAKING WE COULDN'T
FINISH LAST NIGHT IS DONE.

371
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:32,500
NOT BAD, IF
I DO SAY SO MYSELF.

372
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,708
WE MIGHT JUST HAVE A SHOT
AT THIS THING AFTER ALL.

373
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:39,041
OF COURSE, THAT'S NO REASON
TO GET COCKY.

374
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:44,750
- HEY! HEADS UP,
THEY'RE HERE!

375
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:57,375
- LET'S GET A MOVE ON, FELLAS...
GET THOSE LIGHTS UP.

376
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:03,083
- THEIR BOSS-MAN FINALLY
REARS HIS UGLY HEAD.

377
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:06,083
I CAN TELL AT A GLANCE WHICH
ONE OF THEM IS HERE TO RACE.

378
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:07,583
- SO CAN I.

379
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:08,791
JUST LOOK AT HIM.

380
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:15,416
HERE WE GO. MOMENT OF TRUTH.

381
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,625
FRONT AND CENTER, YOU TWO.

382
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,250
AFTER LOOKING OVER
THE DATA FROM LAST NIGHT,

383
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:22,791
I'VE REACHED A DECISION.

384
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:29,208
AND WE'RE GONNA GO
WITH THE 8-6 TONIGHT.

385
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,041
TAKUMI, YOU'RE UP.

386
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:32,791
- ( all gasp )

387
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:36,083
- THIS IS BULLSHIT.

388
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:38,625
I'M THE ONE WHO CAME OUT AHEAD
ON THE FRIGGIN' PRACTICE RUNS

389
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:40,041
LAST NIGHT, AREN'T IT?

390
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:42,000
- CONGRATULATIONS BY THE WAY.

391
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:45,000
- I'M NOT AGREEING TO THIS
UNTIL YOU EXPLAIN IT TO ME.

392
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:47,083
WHY THE DAMN 8-6?

393
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:49,125
- HOW 'BOUT I DRAW YOU
A DIAGRAM AFTER YOU REMEMBER

394
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:50,791
WHO CALLS THE SHOTS
AROUND HERE?

395
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,833
TAKUMI.

396
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:55,750
TAKE SHOTGUN. YOU I ARE GONNA
HAVE A LITTLE HEART-TO-HEART.

397
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:12,458
- YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

398
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,916
- KEISUKE, LOOK...
DON'T LET IT GET TO YOU.

399
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
YOUR BROTHER NEVER WOULD
HAVE CHOSEN THE 8-6 TONIGHT

400
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:19,958
UNLESS THERE WAS
A LOGICAL REASON FOR IT.

401
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:21,750
- YEAH, I KNOW.

402
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:23,208
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING, MAN?

403
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:25,291
- IS THAT ACTUALLY SUPPOSED
TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER?

404
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,291
- OH, GOD.

405
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:56,333
WHOA.

406
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,250
DUDE, YOU HAVE NO
IDEA WHAT I'D GIVE

407
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:01,833
TO WEAR THAT THING JUST ONCE.

408
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:04,375
- YOU IDIOT, THIS IS A
PROFESSIONAL RACING UNIFORM,

409
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:05,958
NOT A COSTUME.

410
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:08,916
WEARING THIS REMINDS ME I CAN'T
MESS AROUND OUT THERE TONIGHT,

411
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,125
NOT WHEN MY PROFESSIONAL
REPUTATION IS ON THE LINE.

412
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:15,250
- YEAH, WELL, I'M JUST GLAD TO
HEAR YOU KNOW WHAT'S AT STAKE.

413
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:18,000
STAY SHARP. THEIR FD IS NOTHING
TO SNEEZE AT.

414
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:20,041
KEEP YOUR GUARD UP.

415
00:22:20,125 --> 00:22:22,250
- DON'T WORRY.
I'M READY FOR ANYTHING.

416
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:24,958
IF I'M NOT CAREFUL, THE FD CAN
LOSE ME ON THE STRAIGHTAWAY.

417
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:27,541
BUT LEAVE IT TO ME, CHIEF, I
KNOW EXACTLY WHAT I NEED TO DO.

418
00:22:42,416 --> 00:22:44,666
- YOU'VE GOT THE 8-6
READY TO GO NOW, RIGHT?

419
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:46,958
- YEP. WARMED UP
AND READY TO KICK ASS.

420
00:22:47,041 --> 00:22:49,000
ALL SHE'S WAITING ON
IS HER DRIVER.

421
00:22:49,083 --> 00:22:51,666
- THAT'S WHAT I LIKE TO HEAR.
LET'S DO THIS.

422
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:52,791
- YES, SIR.

423
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:01,500
- OKAY. WE'RE READY TO GO.

424
00:23:01,583 --> 00:23:03,250
SINCE THE COURSE HAS
MORE THAN ENOUGH WIDTH,

425
00:23:03,333 --> 00:23:05,625
WE WANTED TO SEE IF YOU WOULDN'T
MIND STARTING OFF SIDE-BY-SIDE

426
00:23:05,708 --> 00:23:07,458
INSTEAD OF HAVING
ONE CAR FOLLOW.

427
00:23:07,541 --> 00:23:10,166
- YEAH, SURE.
WHATEVER. FINE.

428
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:11,875
- SIDE BY SIDE IT IS.

429
00:23:11,958 --> 00:23:13,291
ALL RIGHT GUYS,
START LINING 'EM UP!

430
00:23:13,375 --> 00:23:14,416
LET'S GO!

431
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:18,500
- ( engine revving )

432
00:23:22,958 --> 00:23:25,916
- IS THIS SOME KINDA JOKE?
THE 8-6? THAT'S INSANE!

433
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:39,250
- GOTTA ADMIT, I DIDN'T EXACTLY
SEE THIS ONE COMING.

434
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:42,041
- WHAT DO YOU THINK, BOSS, ARE
THEY ANYTHING TO WORRY ABOUT?

435
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:44,000
- ( chuckles ) I THINK
THE BOYS FROM GUNMA

436
00:23:44,083 --> 00:23:46,291
ARE GONNA GIVE US A LITTLE RUN
FOR OUR MONEY.

437
00:23:46,375 --> 00:23:49,458
WE FINE-TUNED THE DEMONSTRATION
CAR UNDER THE ASSUMPTION

438
00:23:49,541 --> 00:23:51,208
IT'D BE UP AGAINST THE FD.

439
00:23:51,291 --> 00:23:54,166
THEIR GOING WITH THE 8-6
WASN'T PART OF THE EQUATION.

440
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:55,583
SNEAKY BASTARDS.

441
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:33,250
OF COURSE, THERE'S
ALWAYS THE CHANCE

442
00:24:33,333 --> 00:24:35,833
THEY'RE JUST
UNDERESTIMATING TOMOYUKI.

443
00:24:35,916 --> 00:24:38,208
I DUNNO. EITHER WAY,
I'M THINKIN' THIS LITTLE RACE

444
00:24:38,291 --> 00:24:39,708
IS GONNA BE AN INTERESTING ONE.

445
00:24:40,958 --> 00:24:42,833
- ALL RIGHT!

446
00:24:42,916 --> 00:24:44,500
HERE COMES THE COUNTDOWN!

447
00:24:55,458 --> 00:24:58,791
FIVE. FOUR. THREE.

448
00:24:58,875 --> 00:25:01,416
TWO. ONE. GO!

449
00:25:08,375 --> 00:25:10,416
- WE'RE LEADING!
BY HALF A CAR-LENGTH!

450
00:25:13,083 --> 00:25:14,291
- DON'T LET HIM PASS!

451
00:25:15,416 --> 00:25:16,958
- THEY'RE COMING UP
ON THE CORNER.

452
00:25:17,041 --> 00:25:18,083
WHO'S IT GONNA BE?

453
00:25:27,375 --> 00:25:28,666
- ( theme song playing )

454
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,166
- ( singing in Japanese )
