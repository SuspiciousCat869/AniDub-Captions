6
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:08,416
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
I PULLED THAT OFF.

7
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,250
IT WAS A BEAST BUT I WON IT.

8
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:11,875
RIGHT WHEN WE PULLED OFF
THE START,

9
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:14,125
I NOTICED I HAD
THE CAR SET WRONG.

10
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:16,666
SCREWED ME UP AT FIRST,
BUT I GOT HER BACK.

11
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,916
EVENTUALLY,
I SWITCHED TECHNIQUES,

12
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,791
ACCELERATING DIFFERENTLY
TO SAVE MY TIRES.

13
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,833
- STILL, IT'S A HELL OF A THING
BEING ABLE TO CATCH ON

14
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:26,125
TO YOUR OPPONENT'S WEAKNESS
IN THE THICK OF EVERYTHING.

15
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:27,625
- YEAH, I KNOW.

16
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:30,375
I'M SURPRISED I NAILED IT. BUT I
NOTICED SOMETHING.

17
00:02:30,458 --> 00:02:34,000
HER CAR WOBBLED FOR A SECOND.
SHE REGAINED CONTROL RIGHT AWAY,

18
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:36,750
BUT LOST SPEED SO FAST
I ALMOST SLAMMED INTO HER.

19
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:39,958
THAT'S WHEN IT HIT ME.
SUCKER'S GOTTA BE PEAKY, RIGHT?

20
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:41,583
MASSIVE TURBO LAG.

21
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:44,625
THERE'S NO OTHER REASON IT'D
SLIDE AROUND LIKE THAT.

22
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:47,583
IT'S A BAD ASS PIECE OF HARDWARE
IN A STRAIGHTFORWARD BATTLE,

23
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:49,583
BUT WEAKER IN HELL
IN A DOGFIGHT.

24
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:51,666
IF I'D PUT THAT
TOGETHER EARLIER ON,

25
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,791
I WOULD'VE TAKEN SOME OF
THE HEAT OFF MYSELF

26
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:55,291
AND RELAXED A LITTLE.

27
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:57,666
- DON'T FORGET THE ACCELERATION
TECHNIQUES YOU'VE LEARNED.

28
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:58,833
I'M SERIOUS.

29
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:00,541
WHEN WE'RE BACK IN AKAGI,

30
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:01,875
I WANT YOU TO PRACTICE
THEM EVERYDAY

31
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:04,375
UNTIL THEY'RE INSTINCTIVE.

32
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:07,041
THEY MIGHT SEEM SIMPLE, BUT
THESE TECHNIQUES AREN'T EASY.

33
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:09,458
AND WHEN YOU MASTER THEM, YOUR
ABILITY TO MANAGE YOUR TIRES

34
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:11,250
SHOULD GET A LOT BETTER.

35
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:12,666
- I HEAR YOU.

36
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,000
YOU HAD THIS THING PLANNED
ALL ALONG DIDN'T YOU, MAN?

37
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:18,458
- I'M SORRY, GUYS.

38
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:19,750
- YOU DON'T HAVE
ANYTHING TO APOLOGIZE

39
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:21,458
FOR AS LONG AS YOU
DID YOUR BEST.

40
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:24,083
- AND YOU DID, RIGHT?
- MMM-HMM.

41
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:26,375
- WELL? THEN THERE'S NO SHAME
IN LOSING TO SOMEONE

42
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:27,625
WHO WAS JUST A LITTLE BETTER.

43
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,666
I THOUGHT THE GUY'D RUSH
AND BURN OUT HIS TIRES.

44
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,250
NEVER THOUGHT HE'D ADAPT
TO THE CHANGES ON THE ROAD.

45
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:34,208
BUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MESS
HE CHANGED HIS WHOLE APPROACH

46
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:35,375
TO THE BATTLE.

47
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,750
I KNOW THEY'RE OUR ENEMIES,
BUT I'M STILL IMPRESSED.

48
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:46,208
RIGHT, WE ALL KNOW
THE DOWNHILL'S NEXT.

49
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:48,333
I'M GOING TO PULL EVERY TRICK
I GOT OUT OF MY SLEEVE

50
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:49,833
TO WIN THIS ONE.

51
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:05,333
- WE FOUND OUT THE ORDER.

52
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:07,416
- YEAH, I'M GONNA BE LEADING.
I ALREADY HEARD.

53
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,750
- YEAH, IT'S KINDA WEIRD,

54
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:10,375
BUT WHEN I WAS TALKING
TO THEM OVER THERE

55
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,416
THEY WERE VERY SPECIFIC
ON WANTING TO CHASE.

56
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:15,750
HOW'S IT LOOK?

57
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:18,583
- SWEET. SHE'S READY TO
CRANK UP WHENEVER.

58
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:21,125
- COOL. I'LL TELL THEM
WE'RE READY.

59
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:23,208
LET'S GET THE CARS OVER
TO THE STARTING LINE!

60
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:26,833
- ( engine starting )

61
00:04:57,541 --> 00:05:00,500
- HEY, WHATEVER GOES DOWN,
JUST STAY COOL OUT THERE, OKAY?

62
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:02,458
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME.

63
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:04,583
I KNOW THERE'S NO CHANCE
I'LL KEEP UP.

64
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:06,541
BUT I NEED TO SEE HOW
THIS EIGHT-SIX DRIVES

65
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:07,708
FOR AS LONG AS I CAN.

66
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:09,416
AND NOT JUST FOR ME.

67
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,375
I AM CURIOUS, BUT I NEED TO
GET THE INFO SO I CAN USE IT

68
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:14,875
IN THE SECOND ROUND
OF THE SAITAMA SHOWDOWN.

69
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:17,041
MY FELLAS NEED THE HELP.

70
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:24,416
- FUJIWARA.
- YEAH?

71
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,208
- DON'T DITCH THE GUY
FOLLOWING YOU.

72
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:29,000
I WANT HIM TO KEEP UP
FOR A WHILE, OKAY?

73
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:30,625
IF HE STARTS TO FALL
A LITTLE BEHIND,

74
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:32,500
SLOW DOWN AND LET HIM CATCH UP.

75
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:34,416
BUT THE SECOND THAT FIRST
HAIRPIN'S IN YOUR REAR VIEW,

76
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,666
LEAVE HIM SUCKING YOUR EXHAUST.

77
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:37,750
AFTER THAT, JUST FLOOR IT

78
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:39,875
UNTIL YOU MAKE THROUGH
THE FINISH LINE.

79
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:42,583
ARE WE CLEAR? ONLY LEAD HIM
THROUGH THAT FIRST HAIRPIN.

80
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:43,958
- WHATEVER YOU SAY.

81
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:47,416
- FUMIHIRO, LIGHT THEM UP.
- RIGHT ON.

82
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,583
ALL RIGHT, HERE COMES
THE COUNTDOWN!

83
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:58,083
STARTING IN FIVE, FOUR,
THREE, TWO, ONE, GO!

84
00:05:58,166 --> 00:06:00,000
- ( tires screeching )

85
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:13,875
- SURPRISED YOU MADE
IT OUT, WATARU.

86
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:17,208
- WELL, PROJECT D'S TWIN ACES
ARE HERE IN SAITAMA,

87
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:19,125
WHAT DO YOU THINK I'M GONNA DO?

88
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:21,833
SIT ON MY THUMBS WAITING
TO HEAR HOW IT WENT?

89
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:26,291
- THE DOWNHILL MUST'VE
STARTED ALREADY.

90
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:28,083
- YEAH, IT'S ABOUT THAT TIME.

91
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:33,583
- NOW THAT YOUR RUN'S FINISHED,
I'VE CALMED DOWN ENOUGH

92
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:35,041
TO REALIZE I'M STARVING.

93
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:36,916
- WE HAVE ANYTHING?
- CHECK IN VAN ONE.

94
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,583
I THINK THERE'S STILL SOME
RICE BALLS LEFT OVER

95
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:40,666
FROM THE STORE WE HIT
ON THE WAY HERE.

96
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,750
- EXCELLENT. I'M GONNA GO
THROW SOME OF THOSE DOWN.

97
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:45,333
WANT ME TO BRING
YOU BACK A COUPLE?

98
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:47,625
- NAH, I'M COOL.
- ALL RIGHT.

99
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,291
- KEISUKE?

100
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:07,916
I JUST WANTED TO SAY, THANK
YOU FOR EVERYTHING YOU DID.

101
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,708
- WHAT? I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

102
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:12,458
AT LEAST, NOT ANYTHING
THAT'D MAKE YOU TO BOW TO ME.

103
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:13,791
- BUT OF COURSE YOU DID.

104
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:16,541
YOU FIXED MY FD WHEN I
WAS STUCK ALONE.

105
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:19,333
- OH, THAT? COME ON,
YOU GOTTA LET THAT GO.

106
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:22,291
THAT WAS ALL BEFORE THE RACE.
IT'S ANCIENT HISTORY, OKAY?

107
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:23,875
- BUT, IT WAS...

108
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:27,541
- LOOK, I SHOULD PROBABLY
SAY THANKS TO YOU, TOO.

109
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:29,583
I LEARNED A LOT
DRIVING WITH YOU TONIGHT.

110
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:31,833
IT WAS A MONSTER BATTLE. REALLY.

111
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:37,083
YOU GOT SKILLS AND YOU CAN FLY
OUT THERE WHEN YOU NEED TO.

112
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:38,791
I'M NOT BLOWING SMOKE
UP YOUR ASS.

113
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:41,291
ANYBODY'LL TELL YOU
I'M NOT LIKE THAT.

114
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:42,625
WHEN WE WERE GEARING UP,

115
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:44,708
I THINK I MIGHT HAVE COME
DOWN TOO HARD ON YOU.

116
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:46,208
I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.

117
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:49,458
- NO. NO, IT'S OKAY.

118
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:51,250
- WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE JUST FORGET THE WHOLE THING,

119
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:52,666
CALL IT EVEN.

120
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:59,041
- SURE, I UH...

121
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:01,708
IT'S JUST, I HAD SO MUCH FUN
RACING WITH YOU TONIGHT.

122
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:05,125
IS IT CRAZY THAT THIS IS ONE OF
THE BEST TIMES I'VE EVER HAD?

123
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:11,041
- ( tires screeching )

124
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,541
- I DON'T KNOW IF HIS
CORNERING IS AMAZING

125
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:19,875
OR THE CRAZIEST THING
I'VE EVER SEEN.

126
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:38,375
- ( stuttering ) SO,
I WAS THINKING THAT...

127
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:46,500
I WAS WONDERING IF MAYBE BY ANY
CHANCE YOU WERE DATING SOMEBODY?

128
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:50,583
- WHAT, LIKE A GIRLFRIEND,
YOU MEAN? YEAH, NOT REALLY.

129
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:52,833
I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR CHICKS,
NOT WHEN I'M DRIVING.

130
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:55,791
- I GOT TIME TRIALS, NEW...
- OKAY! SEE YOU LATER!

131
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:58,000
- WHOA, WAIT!

132
00:08:58,083 --> 00:09:00,875
WHAT A WEIRD CHICK.
SHE'S GOT ISSUES.

133
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:05,958
- AWKWARD.

134
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:11,875
- ♪ POWER OF SOUND ♪

135
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:18,333
♪ POWER OF YOUR FEELINGS ♪

136
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,583
- IT'S ALMOST LIKE
THERE'S A FLOW BEHIND HIM.

137
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:24,500
I CAN'T GET SUCKED INTO IT.

138
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:29,500
BUT WHY CAN'T I KEEP UP?
I DIDN'T EXPECT THAT.

139
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:31,333
MAYBE 'CAUSE THE SLOPE
IN THIS FIRST SECTION

140
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:34,125
ISN'T AS STEEP
AS THE REST OF THE COURSE.

141
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:37,208
BUT THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.
THERE HAS TO BE ANOTHER REASON.

142
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:38,750
HE'S BETTER THAN THAT.

143
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:43,708
MY HEART'S SLAMMING
AGAINST MY RIBS.

144
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:47,250
IT FEELS LIKE I'M OUT HERE FOR
THE FIRST DRIVE IN A NEW CAR.

145
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:49,708
I'M GOING TO BURN EVERY
SINGLE DETAIL OF THIS RACE

146
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:51,750
INTO MY MEMORY.

147
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:53,250
NOW, COME ON.

148
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:55,916
SHOW ME THIS UNREAL TECHNIQUE
I'VE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT!

149
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,458
- Ryosuke: DON'T DITCH THE GUY
FOLLOWING YOU.

150
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:03,166
I WANT HIM TO KEEP UP
FOR AWHILE, OKAY?

151
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,708
IF HE STARTS TO FALL
A LITTLE BEHIND,

152
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:06,333
SLOW DOWN AND LET HIM CATCH UP.

153
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:08,625
BUT THE SECOND THAT FIRST
HAIRPIN'S IN YOUR REARVIEW,

154
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,208
LEAVE HIM SUCKING YOUR EXHAUST.

155
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:12,500
ARE WE CLEAR? ONLY LEAD HIM
THROUGH THAT FIRST HAIRPIN.

156
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:17,375
- ♪ POWER OF SOUND ♪

161
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:54,291
- Wataru: SO NOBUHIKO, WHAT'D
YOU THINK OF THE RUN?

162
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:56,916
GOING UP AGAINST THE FASTEST
DOWNHILLER FROM GUNMA.

163
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,750
MUST'VE BEEN PRETTY HOT
UP IN THERE.

164
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:00,833
- YOU WANNA KNOW
WHAT RACING HIM WAS LIKE?

165
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:04,708
THE WHOLE DAMN THING ENDED
AFTER THE FIRST HAIRPIN TURN.

166
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:06,083
- WHEN I TOOK ON THAT EIGHT-SIX,

167
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,791
THE BATTLE WAS SO NECK-AND-NECK
THE WHOLE TIME

168
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,041
THAT EITHER ONE OF US
COULD HAVE PULLED OUT THE WIN,

169
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:12,291
WE DID HAVE TO TAKE IT
INTO A FIFTH RUN AND EVERYTHING,

170
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:13,458
I MEAN I'M JUST SAYING.

171
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:14,833
- YOU KNOW WHY?

172
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:17,375
'CAUSE YOUR BURN WAS A COMBO
OF UPHILL AND DOWNHILL.

173
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:19,416
IF YOU'D RACED HIM
ON A STRICTLY DOWNHILL RUN,

174
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,416
I DOUBT YOU COULD'VE
LASTED THAT LONG.

175
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,416
- ( scoffs ) GOT ANY OTHER
SCABS YOU WANNA PICK AT?

176
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:28,250
STILL, YOU GOT A POINT.
HIS DOWNHILL FIGHT'S MEAN.

177
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:30,958
- YEAH, BUT, THERE'S STILL
ONE THING THAT'S BUGGING ME

178
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:32,333
ABOUT THAT RUN.

179
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:36,291
WHEN WE WERE OUT THERE,
I GOT THE DISTINCT FEELING

180
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:38,500
HE WAS LETTING ME
KEEP UP ON PURPOSE.

181
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:40,125
- HMM?

182
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:42,166
THAT'S STUPID. WHY WOULD HE?

183
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,791
- IF I KNEW, I'D TELL YOU.

184
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:47,250
MAYBE I'M PUTTING TOO MUCH
THOUGHT INTO THIS.

185
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:49,500
EITHER WAY, I DIDN'T
GET TO WATCH HIM

186
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:50,666
FOR AS LONG AS I'D HAVE LIKED,

187
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,791
BUT I DID SEE
SOMETHING INTERESTING.

188
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:54,708
AND I KNOW HOW TO BEAT HIM.

189
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:56,875
- Man: SERIOUSLY?

190
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:59,708
- THAT'S RIGHT.
AND THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY.

191
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,083
- THIS IS THE TIME TRIAL, RIGHT?

192
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:16,208
DUDE'S FAST.
GOT SOME FIRE IN THERE.

193
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:18,083
- I WONDER WHAT KIND OF RECORD
HE'S GONNA LEAVE US

194
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:20,375
WHEN HE'S DONE WITH OUR COURSE.

195
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:23,333
STILL, WHATEVER HE DOES, TODAY'S
SHOW WAS JUST A PROLOGUE

196
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:25,625
TO ROUND TWO
OF THE SAITAMA SHOWDOWN.

197
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:30,958
THESE GUYS ARE
WORTHY OPPONENTS.

198
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:36,166
I GUARANTEE YOU,
WE'RE GONNA DEFEAT PROJECT D!

199
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:50,916
- THANK YOU FOR YOUR BUSINESS!
- THANK YOU FOR YOUR BUSINESS!

200
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:57,375
- WHAT'S UP, MAN?
- YO!

201
00:12:57,458 --> 00:13:00,416
- KENJI. SO, I DON'T GUESS YOU
HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT LANGUAGE

202
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,125
THE GREETING "YO"
COMES FROM, DO YOU?

203
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:07,000
- SHUT UP, MAN. I BROUGHT YOU
SOMETHING. IT'S D'S HOMEPAGE.

204
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:08,416
- COOL! WELL, HAND IT OVER!

205
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,666
- ( exclaiming ) ME FIRST!
ME FIRST! I WANNA SEE IT!

206
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,625
- Kenji: THEY'RE STILL
DOMINATING. NOTHING NEW.

207
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:15,500
WON BOTH THE UPHILL AND DOWNHILL
WITH BIG LEADS ON BOTH.

208
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:16,916
SET COURSE RECORDS, TOO.

209
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,833
YOU KNOW, THE USUAL.
- ( laughing )

210
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:20,666
THEY'RE SO BADASS.

211
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:23,250
ALWAYS LAYING TRACKS ON ROADS
THEY'VE NEVER DRIVEN,

212
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:24,916
AND THEY ALWAYS WIN.

213
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,375
- THOSE GUYS SURE ARE
INCREDIBLE, ALL RIGHT.

214
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:29,666
I'D KILL TO GO CHECKOUT A RACE
OF THEIRS SOMEDAY.

215
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:33,458
- YOU AND ME BOTH. YOU KNOW,
SAITAMA'S NOT THAT FAR AWAY.

216
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:36,583
SO HOW ABOUT THIS, NEXT
BATTLE, WE ALL GO CHECK IT OUT.

217
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:38,500
- I'M DOWN FOR IT,
IF YOU GUYS ARE.

218
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:41,708
- I'M IN! LET'S FREAKING
DO IT! YEAH!

219
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:48,791
- Girl: THE FACT THAT YOU TALKED
TO THE GUY AT ALL IS IMPRESSIVE.

220
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:51,833
AND YOU ASKED HIM IF HE'S GOT
A GIRLFRIEND, THAT'S UNREAL.

221
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:55,125
- I KNOW, RIGHT?
I WAS REALLY PROUD OF MYSELF.

222
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:58,250
- YOU SCORED BIG TIME, HITTING
ON A SINGLE GUY. WELL DONE.

223
00:13:58,333 --> 00:13:59,750
I BET HE'S KICKING BACK
RIGHT NOW,

224
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:02,416
THINKING ABOUT THAT HOTTIE
THAT THOUGHT HE WAS CUTE.

225
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,291
- DO YOU THINK SO?

226
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:06,166
- SURE, WHY WOULDN'T HE BE?
AS LONG AS HE'S NOT

227
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,333
BLIND, DEAF, AND STUPID

228
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:09,583
HE'D HAVE TO HAVE KNOWN
YOU WERE INTO HIM.

229
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:11,333
ANY MAN WITH A PULSE
WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO STOP

230
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:13,875
ROLLING THAT OVER
IN HIS TINY BRAIN.

231
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:15,958
- I'M LOSING MY MIND OVER THIS!

232
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:18,333
MY DARLING IS THINKING
ABOUT ME RIGHT NOW!

233
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:21,083
- WHAT AM I GONNA DO?
- CHILL OUT.

234
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,083
- OKAY, LOOK,
I NEED TO GET PRETTY, FAST.

235
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:26,708
I'VE NEVER FELT
LIKE THIS BEFORE,

236
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:29,250
AND I DON'T WANT TO BLOW IT
'CAUSE I LOOK LIKE A BOY.

237
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:33,750
I DON'T WANT HIM TO
IGNORE ME, YOU KNOW?

238
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:45,166
- ( tires screeching )

239
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:11,250
- KEISUKE'S GOT A GOOD REP
WITH THE CHICKS RIGHT?

240
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:13,375
- WHERE THE HELL
DID THAT COME FROM?

241
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:14,708
ARE YOU LOOKING FOR A DATE?

242
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:17,666
I DON'T KNOW. JUST THOUGHT
HE'S KINDA GOT THAT VIBE

243
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,625
GOING ON, I GUESS.

244
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:20,208
( chuckling )

245
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:25,166
- EVERYBODY LIKES KEISUKE.
THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS.

246
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,750
ESPECIALLY THE CHICKS.

247
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:28,833
- YEAH, COOL.

248
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:30,625
- BUT LIKE THEM OR NOT,
HE HASN'T HAD ENOUGH TIME

249
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:32,333
TO DATE ANYONE IN A FEW YEARS.

250
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:34,208
-  WHOA! A FEW YEARS?

251
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:36,583
- I GUESS HE FIGURES
THEY'RE TOO MUCH TROUBLE.

252
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:39,041
LAST GIRL HE WAS WITH
THEY GOT ALONG PRETTY WELL.

253
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:41,541
THEY DATED FOR A WHILE, BUT
THEN THE TWO OF THEM SPLIT UP

254
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:43,875
WHEN HE BOUGHT HIS FD AND
JOINED WITH THE RED SUNS.

255
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:46,291
KEISUKE IS THE KINDA GUY WHO
DOESN'T LIKE TO DO ANYTHING

256
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:48,083
UNLESS HE CAN DO IT ALL THE WAY.

257
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:50,875
HE CAN'T SPLIT HIS CONCENTRATION
LIKE HIS BROTHER CAN.

258
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:52,875
IT'S NOT ON HIS
LIST OF STRENGTHS.

259
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:05,958
HE DUMPED HER, SAYING HE WAS
TOO BUSY TO MAKE TIME FOR HER.

260
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:07,750
AND HE STARTED SLAUGHTERING
THE MOUNTAIN PASS

261
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,083
EVERY SINGLE NIGHT.

262
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:11,291
EVERYONE'S GOT THEIR
OWN WAY OF COPING, I GUESS.

263
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:16,375
- HELLO.

264
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:21,291
- I RECOGNIZE THAT FD.

265
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,583
- CRAP! THERE SHE IS!

266
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:44,416
- HEY.

267
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,458
- All: HI.

268
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:49,291
- Tomiguchi: DUDE, YOU THINK
SHE CAME HERE TO SEE KEISUKE?

269
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:50,416
- Fumihiro: PROBABLY.

270
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,958
- Kenta: THERE'S NO
PROBABLY ABOUT IT!

271
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:54,416
WHAT ELSE WOULD SHE
BE HERE FOR?

272
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,000
- ( car approaching )

273
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:01,333
- DUDE, CHECK IT OUT,
HE'S BACK.

274
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:33,958
- Keisuke: YOU CAME
ALL THE WAY OUT HERE?

275
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:37,708
- Kyoko: I HEARD THIS WAS
YOUR HOME COURSE, SO YEAH.

276
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,500
YOU DRIVE EVERY NIGHT,
EVEN WHEN YOU'RE NOT RACING?

277
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:42,083
- NA. I WOULDN'T SAY
EVERY NIGHT.

278
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:44,541
BUT I GOTTA WORK ON PERFECTING
MY ACCELERATOR TECHNIQUES,

279
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:46,583
SO I TRY TO COME OUT HERE
AND GET A COUPLE RUNS IN

280
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:48,250
EVERY TIME I GET A CHANCE.

281
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:51,125
- YOU'RE SO GOOD I'M SURPRISED
YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO WORK ON.

282
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:52,583
IT'S EMBARRASSING.

283
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:54,458
REMINDS ME THAT YOU AND I
ARE ON VERY DIFFERENT LEVELS

284
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:55,750
AS RACERS.

285
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:59,875
- SO, WHY'D YOU COME
OUT HERE TONIGHT?

286
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:07,500
- I WAS HOPING
I'D BE ABLE TO SEE YOU.

287
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:10,625
I JUST WANTED TO SEE YOU.

288
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:14,875
I'M NOT BUGGING YOU, AM I?

289
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:16,583
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT?

290
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:17,833
- SHUT UP.

291
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:20,083
- LOOK, KYOKO, LET ME BE
STRAIGHT UP WITH YOU.

292
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:24,125
IF THAT'S THE ONLY REASON YOU'RE
COMING OUT HERE, THEN DON'T.

293
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:27,916
- BUT WHY NOT? I THOUGHT MAYBE
YOU LIKED ME. AM I WRONG?

294
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,333
- THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH ME LIKING YOU OR NOT.

295
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:31,750
- THEN WHAT IS IT?

296
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:34,208
- YOU BEING HERE
JUST DOESN'T WORK FOR ME.

297
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:38,125
- WAIT! LISTEN TO ME.
FOR A SECOND.

298
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:41,125
I WON'T BLOW YOUR
CONCENTRATION.

299
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:45,333
ISN'T IT OKAY IF I JUST WATCH
YOU DRIVE? THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

300
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:47,625
I WANT TO SEE YOU
BEHIND THE WHEEL AGAIN.

301
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:50,125
I'LL STAY OUT OF
YOUR WAY. COOL?

302
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:53,041
JUST DON'T HATE ME.
I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN TAKE IT.

303
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:59,208
IT MIGHT SOUND DUMB, BUT I'VE
NEVER FELT LIKE THIS BEFORE.

304
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:02,208
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO,
SO HERE I AM.

305
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:08,708
I LIKE YOU. I DO.
IT'S JUST THAT SIMPLE.

306
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:11,500
I'VE NEVER BEEN
THIS INTO A GUY BEFORE.

307
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:15,708
I MEAN, I'VE LIKED OTHER GUYS,
SURE, BUT THIS FEELS DIFFERENT.

308
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:17,666
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
HOW TO SAY IT.

309
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:20,583
THIS MIGHT BE ONE SIDED, BUT,

310
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:23,375
I WANT TO SEE YOU.
I WANT TO KEEP SEEING YOU.

311
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:26,791
IF IT'S HERE, OR OUT,
OR WHEREVER, I DON'T CARE.

312
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:29,166
THAT'S WHY I CAME,
TO TELL YOU THAT.

313
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:32,916
SO IS IT COOL BY YOU IF I COME
BACK OUT SOME OTHER TIME?

314
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,458
I'D REALLY, REALLY LIKE TO.

315
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:45,750
- YOU DON'T GET IT.

316
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:47,500
I TOLD YOU
I DIDN'T WANT YOU HERE,

317
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:50,833
BUT HERE YOU ARE
PUSHING YOURSELF ON ME.

318
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:52,625
IF I REALLY HATED YOU,
LIKE YOU SAID,

319
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:54,875
I'D JUST IGNORE
YOU AND WALK OFF.

320
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:58,083
BUT I CAN'T DO THAT, WHICH IS
WHY YOU'LL ONLY GET IN MY WAY.

321
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:05,458
- ( sniffling )

322
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:11,583
- IS IT SINKING IN? YOU'LL SCREW
ME UP IF YOU HANG AROUND HERE.

323
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:13,375
SO THAT'S IT.
THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING.

324
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:15,625
I DON'T WANNA SEE YOU
HERE ANYMORE.

325
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:24,791
- ARE YOU COOL
WITH THIS, KEISUKE?

326
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:28,291
- WHAT THE HELL ELSE CAN I DO?
NOW MY FOCUS IS ALL OFF.

327
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:39,125
I'M OUT, GUYS.
NO DRIVING FOR ME TONIGHT.

328
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:41,416
- CALL YOU TOMORROW.
- YEAH.

329
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:05,375
- I DON'T KNOW.

330
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:07,291
MAYBE I'M RUSHING THINGS ON THIS
ACCELERATION TRAINING.

331
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:09,750
I DON'T EVEN HAVE TIME
TO RELAX THESE DAYS.

332
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:11,041
BUT I LET UP FOR ONE SECOND,

333
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:13,916
AND TAKUMI'S GOING TO
LEAVE ME IN HIS WAKE.

334
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,250
HE KEEPS GETTING
BETTER AND BETTER

335
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:20,166
SINCE HE JOINED UP WITH D.
IT'S KILLING ME.

336
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,166
I CAN'T WASTE ANY OF MY TIME
SLUSHING AROUND

337
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,875
WITH SOME STUPID CHICK.

338
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:26,750
'CAUSE HE'S OUT THERE
DRIVING EVERY DAY TOO.

339
00:22:19,166 --> 00:22:23,000
- IS IT SINKING IN? YOU'LL SCREW
ME UP IF YOU HANG AROUND.

340
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:24,791
SO THAT'S IT.
THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING.

341
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:26,958
I DON'T WANNA SEE YOU
HERE ANYMORE.

342
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:34,583
- IF I THINK ABOUT IT FROM HIS
POINT OF VIEW, I GET IT.

343
00:22:34,666 --> 00:22:37,250
HIS DRIVING'S
IMPORTANT TO HIM.

344
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:39,791
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
I'M SUPPOSED TO DO NOW.

345
00:22:41,291 --> 00:22:44,083
I'VE NEVER LIKED A GUY
THIS MUCH, EVER.

346
00:22:44,166 --> 00:22:47,875
I WANNA GO TO HIM, BUT I DON'T
WANT TO PUSH HIM AWAY.

347
00:23:02,125 --> 00:23:04,500
STILL, IT'S JUST ONE PROBLEM.

348
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:06,208
AND I'M NOT GOING TO
LET ONE LITTLE THING

349
00:23:06,291 --> 00:23:08,250
SHUT DOWN HOW I'M FEELING.

350
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:10,208
I CAN'T GIVE UP ON THIS.

351
00:23:26,833 --> 00:23:28,250
- Nobuhiko: I'M LOOKING
FOR SOMEBODY?

352
00:23:28,333 --> 00:23:29,875
- HEY, NOBUHIKO. OVER HERE.

353
00:23:31,208 --> 00:23:33,208
- NEVER MIND.
THAT'S THE GUY OVER THERE.

354
00:23:34,541 --> 00:23:36,666
- YOU'RE LATE, PAL.

355
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,958
- SORRY,
TRAFFIC WAS A NIGHTMARE.

356
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:41,958
LET ME INTRODUCE YOU TWO.
THIS IS MY COUSIN, NOBUHIKO.

357
00:23:42,041 --> 00:23:43,666
- SWEET DRIVER
BUT HE'S ALWAYS LATE.

358
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:44,916
- HOW YOU DOING?

359
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,541
- SO, THIS IS SAKAMOTO,
THE GUY WE TALKED ABOUT.

360
00:23:47,625 --> 00:23:49,875
- WHAT'S UP?

361
00:23:49,958 --> 00:23:52,458
- THIS DUDE'LL BLOW YOUR
DOORS OFF. HE'S FAST.

362
00:23:52,541 --> 00:23:54,625
I MEAN, WE ALL KNOW THAT
RALLY DRIVERS ARE FREAKING NUTS

363
00:23:54,708 --> 00:23:56,166
IN THE FIRST PLACE,

364
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:57,750
SO NO ONE IS BETTER SUITED FOR
THE RACE YOU'RE ABOUT TO RUN

365
00:23:57,833 --> 00:24:00,291
THAN THIS GUY.

366
00:24:00,375 --> 00:24:01,708
- IF WATARU RECOMMENDS YOU,

367
00:24:01,791 --> 00:24:04,083
THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR
ME. SHOULD BE FINE.

368
00:24:04,166 --> 00:24:07,125
- YOU SAID YOU HAD SOME GOOD
NEWS FOR US. LET'S HEAR IT.

369
00:24:07,208 --> 00:24:09,125
I WANT TO KNOW ALL ABOUT
THIS PLAN YOU'VE GOT

370
00:24:09,208 --> 00:24:11,416
TO BEAT OUR BUDDY
IN THE EIGHT-SIX.

371
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:15,958
- SURE. I ANALYZED THE DATA
ON D'S PREVIOUS BATTLES.

372
00:24:16,041 --> 00:24:19,125
THEN I FACTORED IN WHAT I
SAW WITH MY OWN TWO EYES.

373
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:22,125
I WAS BEHIND THAT EIGHT-SIX LONG
ENOUGH TO LEARN A FEW THINGS.

374
00:24:22,208 --> 00:24:24,833
USING SIMPLE DEDUCTION AND
PROCESS OF ELIMINATION,

375
00:24:24,916 --> 00:24:25,958
I FOUND SOMETHING.

376
00:24:26,041 --> 00:24:27,208
- HEY, WHY DON'T YOU
USE SMALLER WORDS

377
00:24:27,291 --> 00:24:29,333
AND START TALKING TO US LIKE
REGULAR PEOPLE.

378
00:24:29,416 --> 00:24:31,208
NEITHER OF US GOT
THE BOOK SMARTS YOU DO.

379
00:24:31,291 --> 00:24:33,500
WE'RE A LITTLE MORE ON THE
STREET SMART SIDE OF THINGS.

380
00:24:33,583 --> 00:24:36,125
- YEAH, EASE UP. HE'S RETARDED.

381
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:39,250
- BUT WHAT I'M SAYING IS
ACTUALLY REALLY EASY TO GRASP.

382
00:24:39,333 --> 00:24:42,250
HEY, SAKAMOTO, HAVE YOU
EVER DRIVEN AN FR BEFORE?

383
00:24:42,333 --> 00:24:43,583
- DUDE...

384
00:24:43,666 --> 00:24:45,791
- SAKAMOTO HERE CAN DRIVE
ANYTHING YOU GIVE HIM,

385
00:24:45,875 --> 00:24:47,958
AND FRS ARE WHAT HE'S MOST
EXPERIENCED WITH.

386
00:24:48,041 --> 00:24:50,291
HE'S REALLY AWESOME, MAN.

387
00:24:50,375 --> 00:24:51,791
- THEN THAT'LL WORK.

388
00:24:51,875 --> 00:24:53,625
I'VE BROUGHT THE ULTIMATE
WEAPON WITH ME,

389
00:24:53,708 --> 00:24:55,625
IF YOU GUYS WANNA CHECK IT OUT.

390
00:24:55,708 --> 00:24:58,125
- WHAT? ULTIMATE WEAPON?

391
00:25:04,625 --> 00:25:06,125
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?

392
00:25:12,041 --> 00:25:13,500
- WHOA. FOR REAL,

393
00:25:13,583 --> 00:25:15,875
THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE CALLING THE
ULTIMATE WEAPON?

394
00:25:15,958 --> 00:25:18,125
YOU'RE NOT SCREWING WITH ME
OR SOMETHING, ARE YOU MAN?

395
00:25:18,208 --> 00:25:19,750
I MEAN, DUDE.

396
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:28,875
