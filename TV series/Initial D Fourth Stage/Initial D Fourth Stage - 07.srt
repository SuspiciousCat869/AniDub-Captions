1
00:00:14,541 --> 00:00:15,833
- ( theme song playing )

2
00:00:26,666 --> 00:00:27,958
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:50,625 --> 00:01:52,125
- ( engine revving )

4
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:57,250
- Takumi: MAN, I'M STILL
PUMPED FROM LAST NIGHT'S RACE.

5
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:59,833
THE WHOLE THING WAS LIKE
SOME KIND OF CRAZY DREAM.

6
00:02:01,958 --> 00:02:03,208
- ( engine revving)

7
00:02:06,458 --> 00:02:07,708
- ( tires screeching )

8
00:02:14,916 --> 00:02:17,625
IT WAS MAINLY LUCK
THAT I WON, THOUGH.

9
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:19,958
IF RYOSUKE HAD BEEN
THE ONE TO TAKE THAT GUY ON,

10
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:22,041
PROJECT D WOULD'VE
HAD A SURE THING.

11
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:25,708
WHY DO THEY BOTHER
KEEPING A NOOB LIKE ME AROUND

12
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:28,375
WHEN I'M SUCH AN
OBVIOUS LIABILITY?

13
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:30,708
WILD CARD, NOTHING.
I'VE GOTTA GET BETTER.

14
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:38,000
AM I BEING CHASED?

15
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:41,791
HE'S FAST!

16
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,083
HE'S GAINING ON ME.
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

17
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:16,166
SHOULD I LET YOU PASS,
OR SHOULD I JUST DUST

18
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,250
YOUR DUMB ASS AND TEACH
YOU SOME MANNERS?

19
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:20,666
WELL, AFRAID I DON'T FEEL
LIKE LETTING YOU PASS.

20
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:24,083
NOT AFTER LAST NIGHT. AND IT
SURE AS HELL IS NOT GONNA HAPPEN

21
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:25,375
ON MY HOME TURF.

22
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:27,666
- ( engine revs)

23
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:32,666
- ( tires screeching )

24
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,750
- ( tires screeching )

25
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:58,541
- YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.

26
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:01,083
DOES THIS GUY HAVE IT
IN FOR ME OR WHAT?

27
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:04,250
WHO ARE YOU?

28
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,916
- ( birds chirping )

29
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:14,791
- ( water dripping )

30
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:29,958
- ( tires screeching )

31
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:33,208
- DAMN IT!

32
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:37,375
MR. ENIGMA HERE MIGHT
BE THE TOUGHEST OPPONENT

33
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:39,083
I'VE EVER SEEN ON AKINA.

34
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:40,625
THIS IS INSANE!

35
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:55,166
- ( tires screeching )

36
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:04,958
- ALL RIGHT,
YOU TRICKY BASTARD.

37
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:07,458
TIME TO SHOW YOU A FEW
THINGS I'VE GOT UP MY SLEEVE.

38
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:16,416
- ( tires screeching )

39
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:24,791
- HOLY SHIT!

40
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:03,166
IT'S OVER. I CAN'T BEAT
A DRIVER I CAN'T OUT-BRAKE.

41
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,791
SON OF A BITCH GOT ME.

42
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,458
DAD?

43
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:28,041
HEY, DAD, YOU AROUND?

44
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,500
OH, C'MON. WHERE THE HELL DID
YOU RUN OFF TO SO EARLY?

45
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:51,833
- HEY! SUP, MAN?
- HEY, HEY!

46
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:53,958
- WHAT'S UP, GUYS.
HEY, WHERE'S ITSUKI?

47
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:56,458
- OH, WELL, HE GOT OFF
WORK A LITTLE EARLY

48
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,375
TO PICK UP HIS EIGHT-FIVE
FROM THE SHOP.

49
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:00,833
- WE'RE GONNA GIVE THAT NEW
TURBO ENGINE HE HAD INSTALLED

50
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:02,875
A LITTLE TEST DRIVE
ON THE HILL TONIGHT.

51
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:04,333
- HA! SAY WHAT YOU WILL,

52
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:06,250
THAT EIGHT-FIVE WILL NEVER
BE A MATCH FOR ME AND MINE.

53
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:09,458
TURBO SCHMURBO, YOU CAN'T
GET BLOOD OUTTA THAT ROCK.

54
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:11,250
- WHATEVER. SO, BIG TIME,

55
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:14,750
SEEMS YOU HANDED A CERTIFIED
PRO HIS ASS LAST NIGHT, HUH?

56
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:17,583
I MEAN, HOLY CRAP!
IS THERE NOTHING YOU CAN'T DO?

57
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:19,208
- WELL...

58
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:21,666
- DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT I'M
PROUD TO SEE ONE OF OUR OWN

59
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,208
ON HIS WAY TO BECOMING A LEGEND.

60
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:26,708
WHO'D HAVE THOUGHT SOMEBODY FROM
HERE WOULD EVER MANAGE THAT?

61
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:28,541
- WHATEVER KIND OF FIRE
THOSE PROJECT D BOYS

62
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:32,166
HAVE BEEN LIGHTING UNDER HIM,
IT SURE HAS DONE THE TRICK.

63
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,791
- I ALMOST FORGOT
I BEAT A CIRCUIT RACER.

64
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:37,083
IT FEELS LIKE A DREAM
I'VE WOKEN UP FROM.

65
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:41,333
I'VE HAD MY ASS HANDED
TO ME SINCE THEN

66
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:44,416
AND ON MY HOME TURF
OF ALL PLACES.

67
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:51,708
IT'S STUPID TO LET IT GET TO
ME LIKE THIS, BUT I DON'T KNOW,

68
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:54,833
HAS PROJECT D REALLY IMPROVED
MY DRIVING ALL THAT MUCH?

69
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:56,125
- ( car honking )

70
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:01,708
- ALL RIGHT, HEADS UP, GUYS.

71
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:05,833
- DA-DA-DA-DUM.
BEHOLD EIGHT KINDS OF KICK ASS.

72
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:07,458
( laughs)

73
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:09,416
LOOK UPON ME
AND DESPAIR, MORTALS.

74
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,125
THIS BABY IS GONNA RENDER
YOUR SKILLS OBSOLETE.

75
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,875
- ( tires screeching )

76
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:41,625
- I THINK YOU'RE GONNA
EAT YOUR WORDS, MY FRIEND.

77
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:43,708
THE TURBO'S PUTTING
YOU THROUGH THE PACES.

78
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:45,291
- SURE. WHATEVER YOU SAY.

79
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:47,958
LIKE I'VE GOT ANYTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

80
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:49,708
- ( engine revving )

81
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:53,291
- ( Itsuki gasps )

82
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:55,416
HOLY CRAP, TAKUMI.
DID YOU SEE THAT?

83
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,666
DUDE, I JUST PULLED OFF
A POWER SLIDE.

84
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:00,958
MY WILDEST DREAMS
HAVE BECOME A REALITY.

85
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,291
- SETTLE DOWN MAN.

86
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:05,583
DON'T START PATTING YOURSELF
ON THE BACK YET.

87
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:07,750
HEY, WE'RE BEING CHASED.

88
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:10,166
- ( engine revving )

89
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:13,500
- IS THIS MANIAC GONNA TRY TO
PASS US ON THE STRAIGHTAWAY?

90
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:14,791
- ( engine revving )

91
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:19,166
- HE'S FAST. WHAT
KINDA CAR IS THAT?

92
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:22,791
- IS THAT THE SAME GUY
FROM THIS MORNING?

93
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:30,666
- AN S-ONE-FIVE SILVIA.

94
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,416
- NO, DIFFERENT CAR.

95
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,791
- TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY
HORSEPOWER IS JUST DEMONIC.

96
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:40,791
WAY TOO FAST FOR A COUPLE OF
CLUNKERS LIKE OURS TO KEEP UP.

97
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:42,791
- SO IS IT JUST ME OR DO
YOU GET THE FEELING

98
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:44,083
WE'RE A COUPLE OF BOX TURTLES

99
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:47,750
THAT'RE BEING LAPPED
BY A JACKRABBIT, HUH?

100
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:50,125
- Iketani: WHO YOU CALLING A
BOX TURTLE, JACKASS? HUH? HUH?

101
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:51,791
- Kenji: OW! WHAT THE HELL'S
WRONG WITH YOU?

102
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:54,166
STOP HITTING ME. OUCH! C'MON!

103
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,541
- Itsuki: EVEN AT PEAK
PERFORMANCE, THE THREE-AU ENGINE

104
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:01,166
USUALLY ONLY GROSSES
ABOUT EIGHTY HORSEPOWER.

105
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,875
SO, ANY WAY YOU SLICE IT,

106
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:06,125
ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY IS ALMOST
DOUBLE WHAT SHE USED TO HAVE.

107
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:07,916
AND IMAGINE THE REAR
ACTUALLY SLIDES WHEN

108
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,375
WHEN I OPEN UP THIS BABY'S
ACCELERATOR ON THE HILL CLIMB.

109
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:12,458
IT'S ALMOST TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE.

110
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:14,291
GOD, I'M SO IN LOVE
WITH THIS CAR,

111
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:16,000
I COULD ELOPE WITH IT
AND HAVE CHILDREN!

112
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,500
- WE KNOW HOW IT IS, DUDE.

113
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,541
THERE'S NOTHING IN THE WORLD
MAKES A MAN FEEL LIKE A MAN

114
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:21,500
QUITE LIKE A FRESHLY
RE-TOOLED RIDE.

115
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:23,291
- SO WHAT DO YOU THINK, TAKUMI?

116
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:24,750
WAS HAVING THIS THING
OUTFITTED WITH A TURBO

117
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:25,958
WORTH ALL THE TROUBLE?

118
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:27,541
- I DUNNO.

119
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:29,416
IT FELT A LITTLE WEIRD TO ME.

120
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,291
I MEAN THE CAR DEFINITELY HAS
MORE POWER NOW, THAT'S FOR SURE.

121
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:34,333
- BUT, ALL IN ALL, IT'S
STRENGTHS ARE JUST DIFFERENT

122
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:36,625
THAN MY OWN RIDE, SO IT'D
TAKE SOME GETTING USED TO.

123
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:38,625
- IT'S BECAUSE OF
THE TORQUE, I BET.

124
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:41,208
WITH A TURBO ENGINE YOU GET
A HELL OF A LOT MORE PUNCH

125
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:43,333
FROM YOUR ACCELERATION
THAN A TYPICAL NA.

126
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:44,791
- THAT'S TRUE.

127
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:46,000
WHEN YOU'VE GOT THAT MUCH POWER

128
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:48,166
THE STEERING BECOMES A
REAL ENDURANCE TEST.

129
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,875
BUT YOU SHOULD PROBABLY
CHECK OUT YOUR DAMPER.

130
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:51,500
I THINK IT MIGHT
BE A LITTLE OFF.

131
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:53,125
- ( all exclaim )

132
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:55,166
- IF YOU REALLY WANNA
MAKES THIS BABY FASTER,

133
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:58,041
IT'S MORE A QUESTION OF HOW
IT HANDLES THAN ANYTHING.

134
00:10:58,125 --> 00:10:59,875
YOU'VE GOTTA GET THAT
ACCELERATOR TO OPEN UP

135
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:01,000
WHILE YOU'RE CORNERING.

136
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:02,458
I MEAN, THE LIMITS ARE LOW.

137
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:06,291
SO, THERE'S A POSSIBILITY IT
MIGHT DRIFT ANYWAY, BUT...

138
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:08,791
- ( all gasp )

139
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:12,416
- UH, GUYS, WHY THE HELL ARE
YOU ALL STARING AT ME LIKE THAT?

140
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,208
- OKAY, AM I GOING CRAZY?

141
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:16,208
- I DON'T THINK SO, BUDDY,
I HEARD HIM TOO.

142
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:17,625
- Y'KNOW WHAT?

143
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:20,041
I THINK YOU MIGHT BE RIGHT
ON THE MONEY THERE, DUDE.

144
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:22,375
ITSUKI'S EIGHT-FIVE
IS A COMMUTER VEHICLE.

145
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:26,166
IT'S DAMPERS AND SPRING SYSTEM
AREN'T DESIGNED AROUND A TURBO.

146
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,750
HEY, DON'T TAKE THIS THE
WRONG WAY, BIG TIME,

147
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:30,291
BUT I NEVER IN A MILLION YEARS

148
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:32,666
THOUGHT I'D HEAR WORDS LIKE
THAT COMIN' OUT OF YOUR MOUTH.

149
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,458
- AMAZING, YOU'VE GONE FROM
MORON TO SAVANT OVERNIGHT.

150
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:37,166
THAT'S RIGHT, I WENT THERE.

151
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:40,458
- SAVANT. THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD
WAY OF PUTTING IT, ACTUALLY.

152
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:42,833
WHAT THE HELL THEY'D
DO TO YOU IN PROJECT D?

153
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:45,375
- NOT A THING, SERIOUSLY.

154
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:48,125
IF THOSE GUYS HEARD ME TALKIN'
LIKE THIS THEY'D BE CRACKING UP.

155
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,208
- ( tires screeching )

156
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,041
- THAT'S THE CAR FROM EARLIER.

157
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:15,416
- WELL, HEY THERE,
FELLOW RACING ENTHUSIASTS.

158
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,666
SORRY ABOUT ALL THAT
BACK THERE,

159
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,166
BUT WHEN I SEE A
COUPLE OF STREETERS

160
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,916
I JUST CAN'T HELP MYSELF.

161
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:26,625
BY THE LOOKS OF YOU, YOU TWO
HAVE GOT TO BE FROM AROUND HERE.

162
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:29,500
ME AND MY BUDDY HERE
ARE FROM TOKYO.

163
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:32,666
SO FAR OUR TRIP HAS TURNED OUT
TO BE A DISAPPOINTMENT.

164
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:33,958
- YOU'D THINK WITH
ROADS LIKE THESE

165
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:37,458
THE PLACE'D BE
SWARMING WITH TALENT.

166
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:40,000
- HUH? HEY.

167
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:42,083
NOW, THERE'S A
RARE SIGHT FOR YA.

168
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:44,875
THIS IS A GENUINE
SOHC ENGINE.

169
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:49,666
YOU ACTUALLY GOT AN EIGHT FIVE
FITTED WITH A TURBO? SERIOUSLY?

170
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,875
- WOULD YOU LOOK AT THAT,
THERE'S ENOUGH ROOM LEFT

171
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:55,000
OVER IN THE ENGINE CHASSIS
TO HOUSE A FAMILY OF FOUR.

172
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:56,333
- NOW DON'T BE MEAN.

173
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:58,750
THEY DO HAVE A FRONT MOUNT
INTERCOOLER, AFTER ALL.

174
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:01,041
THAT'LL EXPLODE IF
YOU SO MUCH AS TAP IT.

175
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:02,583
- ( chuckles )

176
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:06,708
YOU COULDN'T PAY ME TO DRIVE
THIS THING. I'D BE TOO SCARED!

177
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:09,958
- SO, ANY CHANCE YOU'VE EVER
SEEN A CIRCUIT RACE FIRSTHAND?

178
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:11,875
- SORRY. NOT ANY AROUND HERE.

179
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,791
- HMM.

180
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:15,666
WELL, IF YOU EVER WANNA RISE
ABOVE BEING A STREETER,

181
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,250
YOU SHOULD SEE ONE.

182
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:19,750
YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN A PART OF
ALMOST EVERY MAJOR CIRCUIT EVENT

183
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:23,000
IN RECENT MEMORY. EVEN THE
ONES ALONG THE PENINSULA.

184
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:24,500
THE MOUNTAIN PASSES
IN A SINKHOLE

185
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:26,333
LIKE THIS ARE NO COMPARISON.

186
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:28,583
OF COURSE, THAT MIGHT BE
JUST AS WELL FOR YOU GUYS.

187
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:29,875
I DON'T THINK YOUR
LITTLE EIGHT FIVE

188
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:32,166
WOULD BE WORTH A CRAP IN
A CIRCUIT RACE.

189
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,375
- HEY, SHUT UP!

190
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:36,208
- ASSHOLE. WHO THE HELL
YOU THINK YOU ARE,

191
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:40,166
TALKING ABOUT OUR RIDE LIKE
IT'S ANY OF YOUR DAMN BUSINESS?

192
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,375
IF YOU ASK ME,
YOU'RE FULL O' CRAP.

193
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:44,125
OH, SURE,
YOU TALK A BIG GAME,

194
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:46,875
BUT ALL ANY OF US HAVE ACTUALLY
SEEN YOU DO SO FAR IS PASS

195
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:50,125
A COUPLE OF UNDERPOWERED CARS
ON AN UPHILL STRAIGHTAWAY,

196
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:52,125
NOT EXACTLY SOMETHING
TO BRAG ABOUT.

197
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:54,916
- WAIT. WHAT ARE SAYING?
D'YOU THINK...

198
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,875
YOU REALLY THINK IT'D BE ANY
DIFFERENT ON A DOWNHILL RUN?

199
00:13:57,958 --> 00:13:59,458
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
TAKE THAT ANY WAY YOU LIKE.

200
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:01,208
JUST LEAVE US ALONE, DICK.

201
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:03,916
YOU WANNA PEDDLE THAT B.S.
YOU AND YOUR SIDEKICK

202
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,333
DO IT ON YOUR OWN TURF.

203
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:06,791
- IF THAT'S HOW IT IS.

204
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,791
- ( engine revs )

205
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:25,291
- WHY DON'T I HAVE
A GOOD FEELING ABOUT THIS?

206
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:27,500
- BECAUSE THOSE IDIOTS
ARE GONNA AMBUSH US

207
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,666
THE SECOND WE TRY
TO DRIVE PAST THEM.

208
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,458
I GUESS WE MUST HAVE REALLY MADE
AN IMPRESSION ON THOSE JERKS,

209
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:34,250
IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE
OUT FOR BLOOD.

210
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:36,000
- C'MON, WHAT WERE WE
SUPPOSED TO DO?

211
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,666
LET THEM CRAP ALL OVER
OUR RIDE LIKE THAT

212
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,625
AND JUST STAND THERE
WITH SMILES ON OUR FACES?

213
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:43,250
- NO, OF COURSE NOT. IT'S TRUE,
MY BABY IS VERY SENSITIVE

214
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:45,500
BUT SHE'LL PULVERIZE THEM
ON THE DOWNHILL.

215
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:47,875
- I DON'T DOUBT IT. NOW
WHADDYA SAY WE SHOW THEM

216
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:49,750
WHAT KINDA DRIVERS
WE REALLY ARE?

217
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:52,125
- HELL YEAH!

218
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:53,750
- WHOA. WAIT A SEC.

219
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:58,166
YOU EXPECT ME TO
TAKE THESE GUYS ON ?

220
00:14:58,250 --> 00:14:59,333
WELL, YOU CAN JUST FORGET IT.

221
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:01,458
I'M IN NO SHAPE TO RACE
ANYONE RIGHT NOW.

222
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:03,000
- IT'S NOT LIKE WE
CAN ASK PROJECT D

223
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:04,583
TO GET INVOLVED ON OUR BEHALF.

224
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:07,583
THEY WOULDN'T GIVE A LAME-ASS
RACE LIKE THIS THE TIME OF DAY.

225
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:09,291
- YEAH. YOU'VE GOT A POINT.

226
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:18,041
FINE THEN. I'LL BE THE ONE.

227
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,583
- ( exclaims )

228
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:23,000
AM I HEARING THIS? UNEXPECTED
DECISIVENESS FROM IKETANI?

229
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:24,958
- UNEXPECTED, HUH? YEAH.

230
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,791
I GUESS SO. LET'S PUT
SOME INSURANCE ON THIS.

231
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:30,625
- INSURANCE?

232
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:37,000
- ( engine running )

233
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:38,666
- IT GOES WITHOUT
SAYING THAT FORGIVENESS

234
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,750
IS OUT OF THE QUESTION.

235
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:42,375
I WAS TALKING SHOP
LIKE A GENTLEMAN

236
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:44,541
AND THEY HAD TO GO AND
GET ALL TWISTED.

237
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:46,791
WELL, THEY HAVE NO IDEA
WHO THEY'VE CROSSED.

238
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:48,416
- HEADS UP, BOSS.
HERE THEY COME.

239
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:57,208
- OKAY TIME TO TAKE
YOUR MEDICINE.

240
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:58,458
- ( tires screeching )

241
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:05,875
- UPHILL OR DOWNHILL.
I'M GUARANTEED A WIN.

242
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:08,125
BECAUSE YEARS OF CIRCUIT-BASED
TRAINING AND TECHNIQUE

243
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:10,583
ALWAYS TRIUMPHS OVER
PISS-ANT STREETERS!

244
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:16,958
- BIG SHOCK, MAN. THEY'RE
CHASING US. HEADS UP!

245
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:19,375
- BRING IT ON. THAT'S
WHAT I'M TALKIN' ABOUT.

246
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:21,875
THIS IS MY FIRST
BATTLE IN A WHILE.

247
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:29,000
- ( tires screeching )

248
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:32,000
- GUESS THE LOCAL SCENERY AROUND
HERE ISN'T TOO SHABBY AFTER ALL.

249
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:34,833
- YOU'RE RIGHT. THAT PIDDLY
LITTLE S-ONE-THREE CORNERS

250
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:36,750
BETTER THAN I EXPECTED IT WOULD.

251
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,708
BUT IT'S NO TROUBLE
TO STAY ON HIM.

252
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:43,541
IT HAS TO BE SAID EVEN
THIS EARLY ON

253
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:47,208
IT'S EASY TO TELL I'M
THE BETTER DRIVER.

254
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:49,958
IT FEELS LIKE I COULD OUTRUN
THE SPEED OF THOUGHT ITSELF.

255
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:51,041
( chuckles )

256
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:54,083
I'M SUCH A BADASS, IT HURTS!

257
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:58,958
- ( tires screeching )

258
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:00,166
- ( exclaiming )

259
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:05,000
HEY, I'M SORRY TO BREAK YOUR
CONCENTRATION AND ALL THAT,

260
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:07,083
BUT DO YOU MIND
IF I ASK YOU A QUESTION?

261
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:09,666
- NAH, MAN. GO RIGHT AHEAD.
WHAT IS IT?

262
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,583
- I DUNNO, MAN, IT'S JUST...

263
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:13,208
DO YOU THINK A
TURBO-FITTED EIGHT-FIVE

264
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:14,916
WOULD REALLY BE AS USELESS
ON A CIRCUIT RACE

265
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,166
AS THAT FAT BASTARD
SAID IT WOULD?

266
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:17,833
- I DUNNO ABOUT THAT.

267
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:19,208
LIKE I TOLD YOU DRIVING
IT'S GONNA TAKE

268
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:20,708
SOME GETTING USED TO FOR ME

269
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:23,000
NOW THERE'S SO MUCH MORE TORQUE,
BUT IT'S WHATEVER, RIGHT?

270
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:25,166
THIS IS YOUR CAR, DUDE.
DON'T FORGET THAT.

271
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,666
HAVING CONFIDENCE
IN YOUR OWN RIDE

272
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,833
IS WHAT RACING IS ALL ABOUT.

273
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:35,041
- I THOUGHT MY CAR
WOULD BE FASTER,

274
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:37,666
I HAD NO IDEA, IT
WOULD BE LIKE THIS.

275
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:44,625
- THIS ISN'T LOOKING GOOD.
IKETANI CAN'T HOLD THE LEAD.

276
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:45,958
- HUH?

277
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:47,958
- YOU CAN TELL BY THE WAY
HE TAKES THESE CORNERS

278
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:50,291
HE KNOWS THIS COURSE LIKE
THE BACK OF HIS HAND.

279
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:53,333
BUT FROM WHAT I CAN TELL BACK
HERE, FATASS HAS BETTER TRACTION

280
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:56,166
HE GETS OUT OF THE SAME
CORNERS WITH WAY BETTER BALANCE

281
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,208
BUT THE DIFFERENCE ISN'T
IN THEIR DRIVING TECHNIQUE

282
00:17:58,291 --> 00:17:59,708
WHEN YOU GET RIGHT DOWN TO IT.

283
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:02,125
IT REALLY ALL COMES DOWN
TO THEIR CARS.

284
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:04,916
- WHO THE HECK ARE YOU AND WHAT
HAVE YOU DONE WITH TAKUMI?

285
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,083
THERE'S NO WAY
HE'S THE TAKUMI I KNOW.

286
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:12,083
THE WORDS COMING OUT
OF HIS MOUTH ARE BITCHIN.

287
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:14,750
- CHECK IT OUT, MAN.
IKETANI'S ABOUT TO GET DUSTED.

288
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:17,375
- FOR REAL?

289
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:19,208
- ON THE STRAIGHTAWAY
AFTER THIS CORNER.

290
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:34,708
- SON OF A BITCH.
WE'RE NOT DONE.

291
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:37,625
- HA, HA! SEE? YEAH, THAT'S
WHAT YOU GET, DILL WEED!

292
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:43,291
THINK YOU STILL HAVE A CHANCE?

293
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:46,750
SEE WHAT YOU THINK AFTER SOME
FREE-BRAKING, CIRCUIT-STYLE.

294
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:55,333
LET'S SEE HOW THEY
LIKE THEM APPLES.

295
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:57,375
TRY CORNERING AFTER HAVING
TO BRAKE LIKE THAT,

296
00:18:57,458 --> 00:18:58,833
YOU COCKY S.O.B.

297
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:00,291
THAT'S A LITTLE SOMETHING
WE IN THE KNOW LIKE TO CALL

298
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:02,291
TAKING THE KIDS TO SCHOOL.

299
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,916
- YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.
HE'S RIGHT ON OUR ASS!

300
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,250
- I DON'T BELIEVE THAT INSOLENT
LITTLE PIECE OF CRAP.

301
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:15,375
IF YOU THINK YOU CAN TAKE
ME DOWN WITH AN S-1-3,

302
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:16,958
THEN YOU'VE GOT
ANOTHER THING COMING!

303
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:22,708
- I CAN'T EVEN KEEP UP
WITH HIM.

304
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:24,875
THERE'S NO WAY IN HELL
THE EIGHT-FIVE CAN.

305
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,708
- ( tires screeching )

306
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:49,958
- ( gasps ) I DON'T GET IT.

307
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:52,000
I THOUGHT THERE WAS MORE
DISTANCE BETWEEN US.

308
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:53,500
HE'S PRACTICALLY IN MY TRUNK!

309
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:58,000
RIDICULOUS! MY FLAWLESS
CIRCUIT-BASED TECHNIQUE

310
00:19:58,083 --> 00:20:00,625
IS LOSING TO SOME CORN-FED,
MOUNTAIN-PASS STREETER!

311
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:07,333
NO, NO. I DON'T BELIEVE IT.
I WON'T BELIEVE IT!

312
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:08,958
THIS ISN'T HAPPENING!

313
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:12,875
- HEY, WAIT JUST A MINUTE.

314
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:14,666
THAT'S NOT THE S-ONE-THREE
BEHIND US NOW.

315
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:15,875
I THINK THAT'S THE CAR...

316
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:17,458
- WOULD YOU SHUT THE HELL UP?

317
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:18,583
HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO CONCENTRATE

318
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:20,000
WITH YOU JABBERING IN MY EAR.

319
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:22,500
I NEED ALL THE FOCUS I CAN GET.

320
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:25,208
- AH, SO YOU'RE GONNA DO THAT.
- THAT'S RIGHT.

321
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:30,208
( exhales )

322
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:32,750
MY MIND AND THE ROAD
BEFORE ME MUST BE AS ONE.

323
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:39,041
WAIT FOR IT. WAIT FOR IT.
NOT YET.

324
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:45,416
SEIZE THE DAY!

325
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,500
HOPE YOU'RE READY TO EAT DUST,
YOU STREETER PUNKS!

326
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:52,416
SECRET WEAPON. MY ULTRA-MEGA
LATE-BRAKING STYLE!

327
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:55,208
( gasps )

328
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:00,250
- ( both screaming )

329
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:10,541
- ( both scream )

330
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:13,208
- OH NO! HOLY CRAP! DUDE,
HANG ON TO SOMETHIN'!

331
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:15,250
WE'RE GONNA CRASH!

332
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,625
- ( laughs )

333
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:25,250
- I'D HAVE GIVEN ANYTHING
TO SEE THE LOOK

334
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:27,416
ON THAT FAT BASTARD'S FACE...

335
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:30,708
GOOD THING WE HAD
INSURANCE, HUH?

336
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:32,458
- AIN'T THAT THE TRUTH?

337
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,333
( laughs )

338
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:36,625
- MAN, IT'S CRAZY HOW
AWESOME TAKUMI'S GOTTEN

339
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:39,166
EVER SINCE THE BIG D
RECRUITED HIM, ISN'T IT?

340
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:41,250
- YOU'RE RIGHT, HE SEEMS
LIKE A NEW MAN.

341
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,416
I MEAN THE WAY HE WAS HANDLING
THE EIGHT-FIVE OUT THERE

342
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,041
LAST NIGHT WAS GENIUS,
PURE AND SIMPLE.

343
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:47,458
HELL, YOU'D HAVE GIVEN ANYTHING

344
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:50,333
TO SEE THE LOOK ON HIS
FACE, BELIEVE ME.

345
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:52,666
BEHIND THE WHEEL, HE WAS LIKE
SOME KIND OF ICE SCULPTURE.

346
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,166
DUDE DIDN'T EVEN BREAK A SWEAT.

347
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:56,416
- PART OF WHY HE'S SO GOOD NOW
IS 'CAUSE HE KNOWS HOW

348
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,208
TO KEEP IT COOL UNDER PRESSURE.

349
00:21:58,291 --> 00:22:00,500
- BETWEEN HEARING ABOUT
THESE OTHER GUYS HE'S BEATEN

350
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:02,833
AND SEEING HIM IN ACTION
FOR MYSELF, I GOTTA TELL YA,

351
00:22:02,916 --> 00:22:04,083
I DON'T THINK WE'LL
EVER SEE ANYONE

352
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:05,916
BEAT TAKUMI ON AKINA'S DOWNHILL.

353
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,500
- ( chuckles)
I'D PUT MONEY ON THAT.

354
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:13,666
- HEY, MASASHI? YEAH, LET'S GO
FOR IT. I LIKE WHAT I'VE SEEN.

355
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:19,041
I KNOW. I HAD DOUBTS ABOUT
THAT ONE AT FIRST, TOO, BUT

356
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:21,333
GUESS YOU COULD SAY,
THAT IT JUST FELT RIGHT.

357
00:22:21,416 --> 00:22:24,833
TOOLIN' AROUND IN THAT THING
WAS EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED.

358
00:22:24,916 --> 00:22:26,208
I'LL GET THE
PAPERWORK TOGETHER

359
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:28,500
AND HEAD OVER TO YOUR
PLACE IN A BIT.

360
00:22:31,458 --> 00:22:32,625
- ( engine revving )

361
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:36,791
- Woman: I'M NOT
KIDDING, WE MUST BE

362
00:22:36,875 --> 00:22:39,291
ON THE PHONE WITH EACH OTHER
AT LEAST THREE HOURS A NIGHT.

363
00:22:39,375 --> 00:22:41,333
THE PHONE BILL'S
TOTALLY KILLING ME.

364
00:22:41,416 --> 00:22:43,250
IT IS SO WORTH IT, THOUGH.

365
00:22:45,416 --> 00:22:47,833
EARTH TO KYOKO.
YOU EVEN LISTENING TO ME?

366
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:50,833
- YEAH, I'M LISTENING.

367
00:22:50,916 --> 00:22:52,875
- WHATEVER. YOU WERE THINKING
ABOUT CARS AGAIN, WEREN'T YOU?

368
00:22:52,958 --> 00:22:54,375
IT'S ALL OVER YOUR FACE.

369
00:22:54,458 --> 00:22:56,541
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA GET A MAN
IF KEEP BEING SUCH A TOMBOY.

370
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,291
- MAYBE I DON'T CARE
ABOUT GETTING A MAN

371
00:22:58,375 --> 00:23:00,041
UNLESS HE CAN RESPECT ME
FOR WHO I AM.

372
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:01,333
YOU EVER THINK ABOUT THAT?

373
00:23:01,416 --> 00:23:04,000
GUYS OVER CARS?
C'MON, THERE'S NO CONTEST.

374
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:05,750
DATING IS FOR PEOPLE WHO
DON'T HAVE BETTER THINGS

375
00:23:05,833 --> 00:23:06,666
TO DO WITH THEIR TIME.

376
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:07,875
NO THANKS.

377
00:23:07,958 --> 00:23:10,500
- STOP IT. YOU MUST
HAVE A FANTASY GUY.

378
00:23:10,583 --> 00:23:12,583
- YEAH WELL. MAYBE I DO.

379
00:23:12,666 --> 00:23:14,708
BUT HE DRIVES A ROTARY, AND
HE'S FASTER THAN ME.

380
00:23:14,791 --> 00:23:17,833
NO EASY ACCOMPLISHMENT
IN REAL LIFE, I GUARANTEE YOU.

381
00:23:17,916 --> 00:23:19,916
PLUS, I'D NEVER EVEN CONSIDER
DATING SOMEONE

382
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,041
WHO DIDN'T LOOK AS BADASS BEHIND
THE WHEEL OF AN FD AS I DO.

383
00:23:23,125 --> 00:23:24,250
- 'KAY, JUST SO YOU'RE AWARE,

384
00:23:24,333 --> 00:23:26,208
GUYS ARE PUT OFF BY
THAT KINDA TALK.

385
00:23:26,291 --> 00:23:27,375
- BUT, YOU NEVER KNOW,

386
00:23:27,458 --> 00:23:29,416
MY MR. RIGHT MIGHT BE OUT
THERE SOMEWHERE

387
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,000
'COURSE I WOULDN'T BET ON IT.

388
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,291
- SORRY ABOUT THIS, KEISUKE.

389
00:23:40,375 --> 00:23:42,500
USUALLY IT'S KENTA'S JOB TO
SCOUT OUT THE COURSE FOR US,

390
00:23:42,583 --> 00:23:44,666
BUT HE WASN'T ABLE
TO GET OUT OF WORK TODAY.

391
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:47,083
- IT'S COOL, MAN.
I HAD NOTHING BETTER TO DO.

392
00:23:51,666 --> 00:23:53,125
- ( birds chirping )

393
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:09,291
- HUH?

394
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:18,000
- THAT GIRL LOOKS LIKE
SHE'S LOOKING FOR SOMETHING.

395
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:20,333
YOU THINK THAT CELL PHONE
YOU FOUND BELONGS TO HER?

396
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:27,791
- LOSE SOMETHING?
- HUH?

397
00:24:28,958 --> 00:24:30,500
- BECAUSE IF I HAD
TO TAKE A GUESS,

398
00:24:30,583 --> 00:24:33,375
I'D SAY YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A
SILVER CELL PHONE. AM I RIGHT?

399
00:24:33,458 --> 00:24:35,666
- AS A MATTER OF FACT, YOU ARE.

400
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:38,041
- I FOUND ONE ON THE EDGE
OF THE PARKING LOT A WHILE AGO

401
00:24:38,125 --> 00:24:40,583
AND I ASKED THE PEOPLE THAT RUN
THAT STORE TO HOLD ON TO IT

402
00:24:40,666 --> 00:24:42,291
IN CASE THE OWNER CAME BACK.

403
00:24:42,375 --> 00:24:44,500
- THANKS. I'M SUCH
A KLUTZ WITH THAT THING.

404
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:46,625
THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME
I'VE LOST IT, EITHER.

405
00:24:46,708 --> 00:24:49,041
I USUALLY JUST STICK THE PHONE
ON THE INSIDE OF MY CAR DOOR

406
00:24:49,125 --> 00:24:50,208
WHILE I'M DRIVING,

407
00:24:50,291 --> 00:24:51,958
SO, WHEN I GET OUT
THE STUPID THING FALLS.

408
00:24:52,041 --> 00:24:55,041
I WAS HERE PRETTY LATE
LAST NIGHT AND IT WAS DARK.

409
00:24:55,125 --> 00:24:56,916
SO, UM...

410
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,083
- NO, I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND.

411
00:24:58,166 --> 00:24:59,625
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY GO
INSIDE AND GET IT.

412
00:24:59,708 --> 00:25:01,458
- RIGHT.

413
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:04,041
THERE'S NO WAY I'M NOT
DREAMING THIS.

414
00:25:04,125 --> 00:25:05,750
I MEAN, LOOK AT HIM.

415
00:25:05,833 --> 00:25:08,708
HE'S GORGEOUS AND THAT RIDE!

416
00:25:13,583 --> 00:25:16,750
OKAY, I'M MIGHT BE
GOING CRAZY, BUT

417
00:25:18,458 --> 00:25:20,958
I THINK I'VE JUST MET
MY MR. RIGHT!

418
00:25:27,583 --> 00:25:29,166
