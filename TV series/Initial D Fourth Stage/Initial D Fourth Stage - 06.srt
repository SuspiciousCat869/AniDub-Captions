1
00:00:10,208 --> 00:00:11,458
- ( theme song playing )

2
00:01:40,833 --> 00:01:42,250
- ( engine revving )

3
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,916
- FIVE. FOUR. THREE.

4
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,541
TWO. ONE. GO!

5
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:18,916
- ( boys cheering )

6
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:22,541
- WELL, TAKUMI'S OFF
TO A STRONG START,

7
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:23,833
WHICH ISN'T ALL
THAT SURPRISING.

8
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:26,416
FR'S ACCELERATE
MUCH FASTER THAN FF'S CAN.

9
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,833
- IT'S AMAZING WHAT A
BIG DIFFERENCE

10
00:02:27,916 --> 00:02:30,833
THE WHEEL ALIGNMENT
CAN MAKE, HUH?

11
00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:33,041
- WELL, SO FAR I GUESS
IT'S WHAT YOU'D EXPECT.

12
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:34,416
AM I RIGHT, CHIEF?

13
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,083
- I SUPPOSE SO, YEAH...

14
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:38,125
THE 8-6 SURE AS HELL
TOOK OFF LIKE A ROCKET

15
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,333
FROM THE STARTING LINE.

16
00:02:39,416 --> 00:02:41,333
BUT I'M BETTING TOMOYUKI
DOESN'T EVEN HAVE

17
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:43,333
THE PEDAL TO THE METAL YET.

18
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:46,791
SPEED IS ONLY HALF THE BATTLE.

19
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,208
IT'S NOT WHO HAS
THE LEAD RIGHT NOW,

20
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:50,333
BUT HOW THESE TWO MANEUVER
THE NEXT FEW CORNERS

21
00:02:50,416 --> 00:02:52,291
THAT'LL TELL US HOW THIS RACE
IS GONNA PLAY OUT.

22
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,125
- YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

23
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:10,916
YEAH. COOL, I GOTCHA.

24
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,541
YOU'RE GONNA THINK I'M
YANKING YOUR CHAIN

25
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,333
WHEN I TELL YOU THIS, BOSS,

26
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:17,208
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE PROJECT D
HAS GONE WITH THE 8-6.

27
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,958
WHAT THE HELL DO YOU THINK
THEY'RE UP TO?

28
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:22,375
I MEAN THE FD WOULD'VE BEEN
ANYONE'S FIRST CHOICE

29
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:23,750
FOR A COURSE LIKE THIS.

30
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:28,000
- COME ON, ARE YOU
THAT ARROGANT, RYOSUKE,

31
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:29,500
OR HAVE YOU JUST
LOST YOUR MIND?

32
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:32,041
I WARNED YOU ABOUT THAT GUY.

33
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:34,333
BEATING HIM IS NOT GONNA BE
A WALK IN THE PARK.

34
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:57,875
- Ryosuke: I'LL ADMIT
TAKING THE LEAD SO EARLY ON

35
00:03:57,958 --> 00:04:00,625
SEEMS AS GOOD
A WAY TO START AS ANY, BUT...

36
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:02,625
...IN A RACE LIKE THIS,
IT CAN WORK AGAINST US.

37
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:06,083
FROM THE STARTING LINE
TO THAT FIRST CORNER,

38
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:07,958
THE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION
WE'VE GIVEN OUR OPPONENT

39
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:09,166
ABOUT HOW THE 8-6

40
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,416
WILL HANDLE THE REST
OF THIS COURSE IS HUGE.

41
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,000
A SHREWD RACER CAN MEASURE-UP
A CAR'S LIMITS BY WATCHING IT

42
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:16,416
ACCELERATE FROM
A STOPPED POSITION.

43
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,750
JUST STEP BACK AND OBSERVE, AND
YOU'LL SEE THE 8-6 LAID BARE.

44
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:22,583
THERE WON'T BE MUCH TAKUMI CAN
DO TO COMPENSATE FOR IT.

45
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:25,625
THE MAXIMUM POWER OUTPUT OF IT'S
ENGINE WILL HAVE BEEN OBVIOUS.

46
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:27,125
HIS OPPONENT WILL BE
ABLE TO FIGURE OUT

47
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:28,750
HOW THE OUTPUT
SCALES AS IT REVS,

48
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:31,041
EVEN THE GEAR RATIO.

49
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:33,833
WHAT IT BOILS DOWN TO IS THIS,
THERE'S NO WAY FOR US

50
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:36,250
TO BEAT A PROFESSIONAL
STRATEGICALLY.

51
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:39,291
- BUT IF WE AREN'T ABLE TO BEAT
HIM STRATEGICALLY, HOW CAN WE?

52
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:41,208
TECHNIQUE?

53
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:43,333
- TAKUMI IS GOOD, BUT I'M AFRAID
HIS TECHNIQUE WON'T HOLD UP

54
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:45,583
AGAINST A
PROFESSIONAL'S EITHER.

55
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:48,208
AND IT'S NOT AS THOUGH THE CAR
HAS ANY SPECIAL ADVANTAGE

56
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:50,708
IN AND OF ITSELF.

57
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:54,416
AS FAR AS I CAN TELL,
OUR OPPONENT'S EK-9 IS FLAWLESS.

58
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,333
IN TERMS OF SHEER POWER
IT EQUALS THE 8-6.

59
00:04:57,416 --> 00:05:00,333
MAYBE EVEN SAYING THAT MUCH
IS BEING OPTIMISTIC.

60
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:02,166
- I'M NOT SURE I UNDERSTAND YOU.

61
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,916
I MEAN... ARE YOU TELLING US
THAT YOU ACCEPTED THIS CHALLENGE

62
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,708
KNOWING THAT WE WERE
DESTINED TO LOSE?

63
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:07,958
THAT'S INSANE!

64
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:11,333
- DON'T JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS,
FUMIHIRO.

65
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:12,625
THAT ISN'T WHAT I'M TELLING YOU.

66
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:15,791
THERE IS ONE THING.

67
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:17,333
ONE THING OUR FUJIWARA HAS

68
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:19,833
THAT EVEN A PROFESSIONAL
RACER DOESN'T...

69
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:24,833
CALL IT AN "X-FACTOR"
IF YOU LIKE.

70
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:27,041
IT'S THE REASON
I CHOSE HIM OVER KEISUKE.

71
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:29,708
THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS A RACE
WE'RE DESTINED TO LOSE.

72
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:31,958
WE WILL ALWAYS HAVE A CHANCE.

73
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:33,750
PROJECT D DOESN'T
EVER BACK DOWN,

74
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,500
NO MATTER WHO THE OPPONENT IS.

75
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:37,375
WE'RE FIGHTING FOR
OUR STREET CRED HERE.

76
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,541
- WELL, GENERALLY SPEAKING, THIS
COURSE CAN KIND OF BE DIVIDED UP

77
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:58,291
INTO FOUR MAIN,
DISTINCT SECTIONS.

78
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:01,166
RIGHT WHEN YOU BEGIN, THE ROAD
IS NARROW AND GOES ON LIKE THAT

79
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,916
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

80
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,166
THE BEST PLACE TO MAKE A MOVE IS
IN THE SECTION JUST AFTER THAT,

81
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,708
WHERE THE ROAD GETS WIDER.

82
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:09,250
PROVIDED YOU'VE GOT THE SAME
SKILLS THAT TOMOYUKI HAS,

83
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:11,041
WITH ENOUGH SPACE YOU
CAN PRETTY MUCH ATTACK

84
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:12,458
FROM ANY ANGLE YOU WANT.

85
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:13,750
FROM THE SECOND SECTION ON,

86
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:15,250
BECAUSE THE ROAD
IS SO MUCH WIDER,

87
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,750
YOU'VE GOT A LOT MORE
FREEDOM WHEN IT COMES

88
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:18,083
TO CHOOSING YOUR LINE.

89
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:20,333
AND BECAUSE THIS RACE
REQUIRES GOING TO THE END

90
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:21,750
AND COMING BACK,

91
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:23,833
IT'LL BE INTERESTING TO SEE HOW
MUCH DISTANCE THERE IS

92
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:25,375
BETWEEN THEM

93
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:26,791
BY THE TIME THEY RETURN TO THE
FIRST SECTION OF THE COURSE.

94
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,291
- ALRIGHT. WE'RE COMING UP
ON WHERE THE ROAD WIDENS

95
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:37,000
AND VISIBILITY IMPROVES.

96
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:39,875
YOU CAN TELL THEY JUST FINISHED
CONSTRUCTION ON THIS PART.

97
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:42,375
IT LOOKS PRETTY,
BUT THE SURFACE IS CRAP.

98
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:44,000
AND THE SEAMS ON THE ASPHALT
ARE ROUGH ENOUGH

99
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:45,166
THAT THE CAR'LL JUMP AROUND

100
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,875
ALL OVER THE PLACE
IF I'M NOT CAREFUL.

101
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,333
GOOD ENGINE YOU GOT THERE.

102
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:53,041
BUT THAT SUSPENSION SYSTEM'S
GOTTA BE AS OLD AS YOU ARE.

103
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:54,208
NO WAY YOU'RE GONNA BE ABLE

104
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:56,333
TO KEEP IT FLOORED LIKE
THIS MUCH LONGER.

105
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:13,583
DAMN. SO EVEN ON
A ROAD LIKE THIS YOU'RE ABLE

106
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:15,375
TO KEEP THAT THING
UNDER CONTROL, AREN'T YA?

107
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:21,208
YOU'RE GOOD, AND THAT CAR
IS WELL-TUNED FOR AN 8-6.

108
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:23,416
BUT YOU CAN'T HIDE THE FACT
YOU'RE STRUGGLING.

109
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:33,000
I DON'T GET IT. WHAT'S THE
POINT IN A RACE LIKE THIS?

110
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:39,083
I MEAN HANDING THIS PUNK HIS ASS
IS FUN ON PRINCIPLE AND ALL...

111
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:41,208
BUT WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO LEARN
FROM THIS?

112
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:55,083
- HEY. KEISUKE.

113
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:00,750
- YEAH, I KNOW, I KNOW.
WHATEVER.

114
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:05,875
- THEY'RE ON
THE SECOND SECTION NOW.

115
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:07,375
- I UNDERSTAND. THANKS.

116
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:12,416
WELCOME BACK. WHERE WERE YOU?

117
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,958
- SULKING IN THE FD, BUT
SINCE I LOOKED LIKE AN IDIOT

118
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:16,291
I DECIDED TO COME OUT.

119
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:20,041
- IF YOU'RE READY TO KNOW WHY,
I'LL TELL YOU.

120
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:38,416
- WE'VE PASSED
THE HIGH-POINT CORNER.

121
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:42,250
THE NEXT PART IS ALL
STEEP DOWNHILL INCLINES.

122
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:45,166
AND NOW THE QUESTION BECOMES
HOW MUCH LONGER I PLAY ALONG.

123
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,041
NOT TOO MUCH LONGER.

124
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:49,916
AFTER ALL, I'VE GOT A LITTLE
SOMETHING CALLED

125
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,416
PROFESSIONAL PRIDE
TO THINK ABOUT.

126
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:01,500
THIS IS FRIGGIN' RIDICULOUS.

127
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:04,708
I'M BASICALLY JUST
WASTING TIME NOW.

128
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:06,541
HELL, I KNEW BEFORE I STARTED
THIS THERE'D BE NOTHING

129
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:08,541
FOR ME TO GAIN BY
RACING AN AMATEUR.

130
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:10,250
GIVING THIS GUY
A LESSON IN HUMILITY

131
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:12,166
IS GONNA BE SO EASY IT'S SAD.

132
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:15,416
BECAUSE ONCE I GET AHEAD
OF HIM, IT'S ALL OVER.

133
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:25,125
- UNLESS I TRY TO SORT THIS
CRAP OUT IN MY OWN HEAD FIRST,

134
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:28,000
I'M NEVER GONNA MAKE
ANY PROGRESS. I KNOW THAT.

135
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:30,416
SO I JUST HUNG BACK
IN THE FD FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

136
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,708
I NEEDED TO WORK OUT FOR MYSELF
WHAT YOUR REASONS WERE

137
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:34,625
FOR NOT CHOOSING ME.

138
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:37,166
AND I THINK I GET IT NOW.

139
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,541
KNOWING WE WERE UP
AGAINST A REAL PROFESSIONAL,

140
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:42,250
I'VE BEEN WAY TOO ANXIOUS
ABOUT TAKING THIS GUY ON.

141
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:43,958
I CONVINCED MYSELF I
WAS THE ONLY ONE

142
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,500
WHO COULD WIN THIS RACE.

143
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:48,375
BASICALLY ALL THAT PRESSURE
WAS REALLY STARTING GET TO ME.

144
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:51,333
IF I WAS ACTUALLY RACING HIM
OUT THERE NOW, I'D BE SCREWED.

145
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:53,791
SO TAKUMI WAS
THE OBVIOUS CHOICE.

146
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:55,541
- THAT IS PART OF IT, YEAH.

147
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:57,708
BUT THERE WAS A LITTLE MORE
TO IT ACTUALLY.

148
00:09:57,791 --> 00:09:59,208
- TO PUT IT SIMPLY,

149
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:02,708
HOW FAST YOU ARE DEPENDS ON HOW
EXPERIENCED YOU ARE.

150
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:05,458
A PROFESSIONAL RACER
IS UNDER CONSTANT,

151
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:08,416
AND I MEAN CONSTANT PRESSURE TO
TIGHTEN UP HIS LAP TIMES.

152
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,541
STREET RACING'S A WHOLE
OTHER BALL OF WAX.

153
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:11,958
COMPARED TO THE
PROFESSIONAL CIRCUIT,

154
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:14,166
YOU GUYS ARE ON AN
ENDLESS VACATION.

155
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,791
TOMOYUKI IS DEALING
WITH THINGS RIGHT NOW

156
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:17,583
YOU CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE.

157
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:20,458
- THE WHOLE POINT OF PROJECT D
IS TO HELP ME DEVELOP MY THEORY

158
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:22,083
ON BEING THE FASTEST DRIVER,

159
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:24,375
SO, LIKE ANY GOOD
SCIENTIFIC STUDY,

160
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:27,291
THERE'S A CONTROL GROUP
AND AN EXPERIMENTAL ONE.

161
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:29,000
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE
TWO DRIVERS.

162
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:33,708
- IF THERE IS SUCH A THING AS A
NATURAL APTITUDE FOR DRIVING,

163
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:36,625
AND I'M NOT SURE THERE IS, ALL
IT REALLY MEANS IS THAT SOMEONE

164
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:38,541
WHO'S GOT IT WILL IMPROVE
AT A FASTER PACE

165
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:40,000
THAN SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T.

166
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:41,958
IN THE END, TALENT CAN'T
HOLD A CANDLE

167
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:44,250
TO PRACTICE AND SELF-DISCIPLINE.

168
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:46,375
IT'S NOT ABOUT
HOW GOOD YOU ARE.

169
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:49,041
WHAT IT'S ABOUT IS HOW
YOU GOT AS GOOD AS YOU ARE.

170
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:50,625
- BECAUSE OF YOUR
DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS,

171
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:52,666
ONE OF YOU BRINGS TO BEAR
A MORE ORTHODOX,

172
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,583
CIRCUIT-DERIVED APPROACH
TO RACING.

173
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,833
WHILE THE OTHER COMES
FROM THE STREET,

174
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:02,291
.A KIND OF "NOBLE SAVAGE,"
SO TO SPEAK.

175
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:04,416
SOMEONE WHO'S TECHNIQUE
REPRESENTS A HODGE-PODGE

176
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,000
OF DIFFERENT STYLES

177
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:08,250
AND WHOSE ONLY GOAL IS TO BE THE
FASTEST DRIVER ON THE STREET.

178
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:16,833
DO YOU GET WHAT
I MEAN, KEISUKE?

179
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:19,125
OUR OPPONENT TONIGHT
IS AN ORTHODOX RACER.

180
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:21,208
AND AN INCREDIBLE ONE
AT THAT.

181
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:23,916
SO, IT'S NOT A QUESTION OF
TAKUMI BEING ANY BETTER OR WORSE

182
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,958
THAN YOU ARE.

183
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:27,041
- IS THIS STARTING
TO SINK IN YET?

184
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:29,333
WINNING A RACE
IS A MATTER OF EXPERIENCE.

185
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:32,000
THAT'S THE REASON YOU TWO
LOST TO PROJECT D.

186
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:34,916
AND WHY TOMOYUKI
WON'T LET THAT HAPPEN TO HIM.

187
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,083
- IN THIS CASE, THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN WINNING AND LOSING

188
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:39,458
IS A QUESTION OF DRIVING STYLE.

189
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,833
- I GET IT NOW.

190
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:44,291
SO THEN YOU DID PUT
A LOT OF THOUGHT

191
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:46,291
INTO THIS DECISION AFTER ALL.

192
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:49,291
BUT WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST TELL
US THAT FROM THE BEGINNING?

193
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,500
I MEAN, WE COULD HAVE AVOIDED
ALL THIS CONFUSION, YOU KNOW?

194
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:54,916
- I AM SORRY ABOUT THAT.

195
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,625
BUT I THINK YOU'LL FIND
MOST OF THE CONFUSION

196
00:11:57,708 --> 00:11:59,541
BELONGS TO OUR OPPONENTS.

197
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:06,916
LOOK OUT! HERE THEY COME.

198
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,625
STRAIGHT FOR THE FOUR
SNAKE HAIRPINS.

199
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:14,166
- ( tires screeching )

200
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,166
- YOU'RE KIDDING ME! HERE?

201
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,750
- HOLY CRAP. THE 8-6 JUST GOT
PASSED ON THE FIRST HAIRPIN!

202
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:00,333
- IT'S THE VANISHING LINE.

203
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:05,833
- VANISHING LINE?

204
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:07,416
- IF YOU CAN FIND IT, YOU'RE
PRETTY MUCH INVISIBLE

205
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,375
TO THE GUY IN FRONT OF YOU.

206
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:10,583
FROM WHERE WE'RE STANDING,

207
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:12,583
IT JUST LOOKS LIKE HE
TOOK THE INSIDE.

208
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:15,333
BUT WHAT HE DID WAS ACTUALLY
A VERY SKILLED MOVE.

209
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:18,375
IT'S USED IN CIRCUIT
RACES ALL THE TIME.

210
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:20,541
YOU ESSENTIALLY USE YOUR
OPPONENT'S BLIND SPOT

211
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:23,041
TO CUT ACROSS AND
SLIP INTO HIS LINE.

212
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:24,875
SOUNDS SIMPLE, BUT IT'S NOT.

213
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:28,166
I HEAR WHEN IT'S TIMED
JUST RIGHT,

214
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:29,791
EVEN A SEASONED PROFESSIONAL
CAN'T AVOID BEING DUSTED

215
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:32,375
BY SOMEONE WHO USES THAT MOVE.

216
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:34,000
THIS DUDE IS SOMETHING ELSE.

217
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:43,333
THE FOUR HAIRPINS ON THIS
COURSE ARE WIDE ENOUGH

218
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:44,958
THAT AN EXPERIENCED
DRIVER CAN CHOOSE

219
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:46,125
FROM SEVERAL DIFFERENT LINES

220
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:48,083
WHEN EXECUTING THE MOVE.

221
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:50,375
WHEN YOU GET DOWN DO IT, THIS
COURSE HAS A LOT OF FEATURES

222
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:52,416
IN COMMON WITH
A CIRCUIT TRACK,

223
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:56,166
MEANING SOMEONE LIKE TOMOYUKI IS
GONNA FEEL RIGHT AT HOME HERE.

224
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:03,250
- DAMN! THIS GUY IS FLYIN'!

225
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:10,083
- Masashi: ANYBODY HOME?

226
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:13,375
- BACK HERE, MASASHI.

227
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:17,500
SO, 'BOUT THAT CHAT
WE HAD EARLIER,

228
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:19,958
DO HAVE A SPECIFIC PREFERENCE
AS TO THE YEAR?

229
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:22,833
- AS LONG AS IT DOESN'T HAVE
WINGS OR SOME FLASHY PAINT JOB,

230
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:24,541
I REALLY COULDN'T CARE
LESS ABOUT THE YEAR.

231
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,541
- YEAH, YOU SAY THAT NOW.

232
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:29,958
ANYWAY I GOT THIS FELLA
I DO BUSINESS WITH TOLD ME

233
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:31,958
HE'D LET ME KNOW
IF HE FOUND ONE, SO...

234
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:35,708
MM. YOU'LL SEE FOR YOURSELF ONCE
YOU'VE DRIVEN ONE, THOUGH...

235
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,750
A FOUR WHEEL DRIVE
DOESN'T REALLY SUIT YOU.

236
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,375
- WE'LL REACH THE MAXIMUM
SPEED FOR THIS COURSE

237
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:48,791
RIGHT BEFORE THE
BRIDGE COMING UP.

238
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:50,583
THE SECTION AFTER IT
IS A STEEP UPHILL CLIMB,

239
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:52,250
SO I'D BETTER PULL AWAY NOW.

240
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:53,750
IT'S TIME FOR ME TO FINISH THIS.

241
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,500
HE WASN'T HALF BAD
FOR AN AMATEUR.

242
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:10,375
- ONCE WE'VE CROSSED THE BRIDGE,
WE'LL REACH THE UPHILL PART.

243
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:13,583
IF THIS BABY CAN'T PICK UP
THE PACE, I'M DONE FOR.

244
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:16,000
COME ON, 8-6!
SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT!

245
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:31,666
- WHAT THE HELL?

246
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:48,500
LITTLE BASTARD'S ACTUALLY
KEEPING UP WITH ME.

247
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,541
I'LL BE DAMNED.

248
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,250
WE WERE EXPECTING
TO RACE THE FD,

249
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:55,916
SO WE SET UP THE GEARS
TO PERFORM BEST

250
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,166
ON A HIGH-SPEED
STRAIGHTAWAY,

251
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,500
WHERE THE FD WOULD'VE
HAD THE MOST LEVERAGE.

252
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:02,083
LOOKS LIKE THAT OVERSIGHT
IS CATCHING UP WITH ME.

253
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:04,708
MY SHIFTS AREN'T SYNCING UP
WORTH A DAMN ON THESE LOW-SPEED,

254
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:06,791
UPHILL CORNERS.

255
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:10,666
IF MY OPPONENT HAD BEEN A TURBO,
THIS WOULDN'T BE AN ISSUE.

256
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:14,041
DID THEY PULL THE 8-6
OUT OF THEIR ASS OR WHAT?

257
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:15,916
THE BRAINS BEHIND THIS OUTFIT
MUST REALLY KNOW

258
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,375
WHAT HE'S DOING.

259
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:20,625
IT WASN'T ALL THAT APPARENT
ON THE DOWNHILL,

260
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:23,541
BUT ON THE UPHILL THE FACT
IS STARING ME IN THE FACE.

261
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:26,416
THE 8-6 HAS BETTER SHIFTING
POINTS FOR ITS GEARS,

262
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,166
PURE AND SIMPLE.

263
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,916
ON THE CORNERS I HAVE TO
TAKE IN SECOND GEAR,

264
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,041
HE'S STILL IN FIRST.

265
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,750
SOMETHING ELSE I'VE NOTICED,

266
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:44,833
THE 8-6'S GAME HAS
DEFINITELY STEPPED UP

267
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:46,916
SINCE I PASSED IT BACK
THERE ON THE HAIRPIN.

268
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,625
MY OPPONENT IS MORE
FOCUSED NOW.

269
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:29,583
WAY TO KEEP UP WITH ME, KID.

270
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:31,791
IT'S KINDA LIKE I'M SEEING
MYSELF IN THE REARVIEW MIRROR.

271
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:38,250
- AT THIS RATE, HE'LL NEVER GIVE
ME ENOUGH SPACE TO PASS HIM.

272
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:39,416
WHAT THE HELL AM I GONNA DO?

273
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:44,208
MY ONLY CHANCE IS TO DISAPPEAR.

274
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:46,458
I'VE GOT TO FIND A WAY TO GET
OUT OF HIS FIELD OF VISION

275
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:48,833
LIKE HE DID TO ME BEFORE.

276
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:50,000
I'VE GOT TO TRY!

277
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:01,916
NOW!

278
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,291
- HE'S GONE.

279
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:09,666
WHERE THE HELL DID HE GO?

280
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:16,291
THAT'S NOT THE SOUND
OF MY ENGINE.

281
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:18,250
WHERE ARE YOU?

282
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:23,000
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

283
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:33,541
NICE ONE.

284
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:35,208
THAT'S YOUR LITTLE SPIN
ON THE VANISHING LINE TRICK

285
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:37,916
I PULLED EARLIER I TAKE IT.

286
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,125
FIRST TIME A CAR I'VE ALREADY
OVERTAKEN ON A MOUNTAIN PASS

287
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:42,125
HAS EVER GOT OUT
IN FRONT OF ME AGAIN.

288
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,291
I THINK I'M FINALLY
BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND

289
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:49,250
WHAT THE CHIEF IS TRYING
TO SHOW ME WITH THIS RACE.

290
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:51,083
AND I AM THROUGH
HOLDING BACK!

291
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:04,666
- HERE THEY COME!

292
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,333
- IS THE 8-6 OUT IN THE LEAD?

293
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,416
- I'LL MAKE MY MOVE
ON THE FOURTH SNAKE HAIRPIN.

294
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,875
DON'T TAKE WHAT I'M
ABOUT TO DO PERSONALLY, KID.

295
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:18,958
ON THE CIRCUIT YOU DO WHAT
YOU GOTTA DO TO WIN.

296
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:23,291
♪ COME ON BABY
LIGHT MY FIRE ♪

297
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:25,041
♪ READY FOR THE SHOW ♪

298
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:29,166
♪ NOW I FEEL YOUR LOVE DESIRE ♪

299
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:31,958
- ( thuds )

300
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:33,541
- ( tires screeching )

301
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,083
- THERE, SEE?

302
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:40,750
I DIDN'T BUMP YOU HARD ENOUGH
TO MAKE YOU SPIN OUT,

303
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:42,833
-JUST ENOUGH TO THROW
YOUR RHYTHM OFF FOR A SECOND.

304
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,666
LIKE I SAID, NOTHING PERSONAL.

305
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,875
TACTICS LIKE THAT ARE A
PROFESSIONAL'S BREAD AND BUTTER.

306
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:55,250
- RYOSUKE. SORRY,
BUT I HAVE TO KNOW.

307
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:57,500
EXACTLY WHAT KIND OF ADVICE
DID YOU GIVE TAKUMI

308
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:59,500
WHEN YOU TOOK HIM AROUND
THE COURSE IN THE FC?

309
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:01,041
- I DIDN'T GIVE HIM ANY ADVICE.

310
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,583
- WHAT?

311
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:04,708
- I JUST SHOWED HIM THE COURSE.

312
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:06,833
I MEAN, WE DISCUSSED THE
STRATEGY I'D COME UP WITH

313
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:08,958
BY DRIVING IT MYSELF, SURE...

314
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,250
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY
WE DISCUSSED

315
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:12,166
HOW HIS INSTINCTS
DIFFER FROM MINE.

316
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,208
WHAT HE'D DO
ON A COURSE LIKE THIS.

317
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:16,333
- BUT YOU DID HAVE
A STRATEGY, RIGHT?

318
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:18,875
AND HE'S BASICALLY RUNNING
THE COURSE ACCORDING TO IT?

319
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:21,583
THAT'S WHY YOU CAME HERE SO
EARLY THE OTHER DAY, ISN'T IT?

320
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:23,166
TO THINK IT THROUGH
WITH HIM IN MIND.

321
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:26,166
- THE FINISH LINE ISN'T FAR OFF.

322
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,208
IF HE PULLS AWAY FROM ME NOW
THERE'S NO WAY IN HELL

323
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:30,125
I'M GONNA BE ABLE TO CATCH UP.

324
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,875
- OH C'MON, THAT AGAIN?

325
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:36,500
THAT TRICK'LL ONLY
WORK ONCE ON ME.

326
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:42,083
THE 8-6 IS RIGHT ON HIS TAIL.

327
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,750
DID YOU GUYS SEE THAT?

328
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:48,000
THE EIGHT-SIX IS DRIVING
WITH ITS HEADLIGHTS OFF!

329
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:51,666
- HUH? HE'S DRIVING
WITH HIS LIGHTS OFF?

330
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,750
YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS!

331
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:02,416
- MAN, HE'S REALLY KEEPING UP
WITH ME.

332
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,708
I CAN'T SEE HIM IN MY MIRRORS,
BUT I KNOW HE'S THERE.

333
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:11,666
YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!

334
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,833
HOW CAN THIS JOKER MANEUVER
THROUGH A MOUNTAIN PASS

335
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:15,125
IN TOTAL DARKNESS?

336
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:16,333
HE'S CRAZY!

337
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:26,375
DON'T LOOK AT HIS TAILLIGHTS.

338
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:27,833
LOOK AT THE ROAD
IN FRONT OF HIM.

339
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:30,125
ALL YOU NEED TO SEE
IS RIGHT THERE.

340
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:31,791
I'VE GOT TO BURN
THAT IMAGE INTO MY HEAD

341
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:34,375
AND FOCUS ON FOLLOWING
THE LINE RYOSUKE SHOWED ME.

342
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:36,166
IT'S THE ONLY WAY
I'LL WIN THIS THING.

343
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:43,708
- ANYONE WHO'LL GO THIS FAR
EARNS MY RESPECT.

344
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:45,375
YOU'RE ONE HELL
OF A DRIVER, KID,

345
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:47,708
BUT WE'RE IN THE FINAL
SECTION NOW.

346
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:49,583
AND THE ROAD IS TOO NARROW
FOR YOU TO PASS ME.

347
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:53,875
THIS RACE IS MINE!

348
00:22:00,541 --> 00:22:02,875
- I HEAR THE 8-6 IS TAILING HIM
WITH ITS HEADLIGHTS OFF!

349
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:06,041
- OUTSTANDING.

350
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:07,958
I HAVEN'T TAUGHT HIM THAT MUCH.

351
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:10,375
TAKUMI CAME UP
WITH THAT ON HIS OWN.

352
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:13,500
EXACTLY THE KIND OF MAGIC
I WAS COUNTING ON.

353
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:15,500
YOUR ONE-OF-A-KIND
TALENT FOR ADAPTING

354
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:17,291
WHEN PUSHED TO THE EDGE.

355
00:22:24,083 --> 00:22:25,666
- THE FINISH LINE IS UP AHEAD.

356
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,791
IT MAY HAVE BEEN MESSY,
BUT IT'S STILL A WIN.

357
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:29,083
I WON'T GIVE UP.

358
00:22:29,166 --> 00:22:31,250
IF THERE'S AN OPENING,
I'M TAKING IT!

- SO, UH, WHY DID YOU SWERVE
OUT OF YOUR LINE BACK THERE?

366
00:23:29,958 --> 00:23:31,458
- HMM?

367
00:23:31,541 --> 00:23:33,416
- YOU KNOW, RIGHT BEFORE
THAT LAST CORNER.

368
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,750
AH, BACK THERE YOU MEAN.

369
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:37,958
THAT WAS JUST GOOD
OLD FASHIONED BAD LUCK.

370
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:39,833
SOME ANIMAL CROSSED THE ROAD
AND STARTLED ME.

371
00:23:40,916 --> 00:23:43,041
I INSTINCTIVELY DODGED.

372
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:45,791
HEY, THAT'S JUST THE WAY
IT GOES SOMETIMES, RIGHT?

373
00:23:45,875 --> 00:23:46,958
OF COURSE, THE UPHILL PART

374
00:23:47,041 --> 00:23:49,416
RIGHT BEFORE THE FINISH
LINE DIDN'T HELP.

375
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,333
- I SEE WHAT
YOU'RE SAYING, BUT...

376
00:23:51,416 --> 00:23:52,500
- YEAH WELL.

377
00:23:52,583 --> 00:23:54,458
I GUESS SOME GUYS
GET ALL THE LUCK, HUH?

378
00:23:55,708 --> 00:23:57,166
- WELL, I...

379
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:58,625
- THE RACE IS YOURS, KID.

380
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,750
I DUNNO IF THERE'S ANY SUCH
THING AS A "GODDESS OF VICTORY,"

381
00:24:05,833 --> 00:24:08,166
OR WHATEVER, BUT IF THERE IS,

382
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:10,041
IT'S PRETTY EASY TO SEE
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT YOU

383
00:24:10,125 --> 00:24:12,333
THAT DEFINITELY STRIKES
THE OLD GIRL'S FANCY.

384
00:24:14,291 --> 00:24:15,416
AND I LOST TONIGHT.

385
00:24:29,791 --> 00:24:31,375
- I CAN'T THANK YOU
ENOUGH, TODO.

386
00:24:31,458 --> 00:24:33,416
I THINK I FINALLY GET WHAT
YOU WERE TRYING TO TELL ME

387
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,333
WITH ALL OF THIS,
AND YOU'RE RIGHT.

388
00:24:35,416 --> 00:24:36,791
- IS THAT SO?

389
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:38,000
- HOWEVER BIG OR IMPORTANT

390
00:24:38,083 --> 00:24:39,833
I FEEL AS PART OF THE
PROFESSIONAL WORLD,

391
00:24:39,916 --> 00:24:43,041
WHERE I CAME FROM SHOULD ALWAYS
BE A PLACE I CAN GO BACK TO.

392
00:24:43,125 --> 00:24:46,416
WHEN I'M LOST OR I GET
CONFUSED, ALL I HAVE TO DO

393
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,333
IS FOLLOW MY ROOTS UNTIL
I GET BACK HOME.

394
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,916
I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW
REJUVENATED I FEEL RIGHT NOW.

395
00:24:54,416 --> 00:24:55,458
- I KNOW.

396
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:29,000
- ( theme music playing )

397
00:25:57,791 --> 00:25:59,458
- ( singing in Japanese )
