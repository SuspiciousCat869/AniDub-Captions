8
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:19,750
I HATE TO BE THE ONE
TO TELL YOU THIS,

9
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:21,500
BUT JUST BETWEEN YOU AND ME,

10
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:22,750
YOU AND YOUR LITTLE
CREW OVER THERE

11
00:02:22,833 --> 00:02:24,541
ARE IN FOR A WORLD OF HURT.

12
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,166
MY BUDDY DIDN'T APPRECIATE YOUR
BOY YELLING AT HIM

13
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,333
AND HE MAY HAVE
GONE OFF THE DEEP END.

14
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:33,083
MAYBE YOU DON'T TRY SO HARD
TO WIN THIS THING.

15
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:35,083
- WHY DON'T YOU
JUST SAY IT, MAN.

16
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:38,000
EITHER I TAKE A DIVE TONIGHT OR
MY FRIENDS GET BEATEN UP.

17
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:40,250
- DON'T GO PUTTIN' WORDS
IN MY MOUTH, KIDDO.

18
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:41,958
I'M JUST TRYIN' TO DO THE
NEIGHBORLY THING HERE,

19
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:43,375
THAT'S ALL.

20
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:45,291
I'M JUST SAYING THERE'S A LOT
MORE IMPORTANT THINGS

21
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:46,333
THAN WINNING...

22
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:49,541
LIKE BEING ABLE TO WALK.

23
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:54,416
- THEY'RE CLOSE, MAN.

24
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,041
SOUNDS LIKE THEY'RE JUST
AROUND THE CORNER.

25
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:59,166
- WE'RE 'BOUT TO GET A GOOD IDEA
HOW THE RACE IS GONNA SHAPE UP.

26
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,916
THAT CORNER IS ONE OF THE
TOUGHEST SPOTS ON THIS COURSE.

27
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,875
IT'S ALL SMOOTH SAILIN'
AT FIRST,

28
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:05,750
BUT RIGHT AFTER THOSE
SOFT CURVES UP TOP

29
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:07,583
THERE'S A HARD LEFT.

30
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:08,791
YOU CAN'T BRAKE WORTH A DAMN

31
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:12,083
'CAUSE YOU CAN'T DRAW
A STRAIGHT LINE.

32
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:15,083
- LET'S SEE HOW THE TOP
GUNMA DOWNHILL RACER DOES.

33
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:17,458
SERIOUSLY I DON'T THINK
THIS GUY GOT A PRAYER.

34
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:20,916
I MEAN, C'MON, HIS RIDE
ISN'T EVEN EQUIPPED WITH AN ABS.

35
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
- ( tires screeching )

36
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,541
- DAMN! THE HELL IS
HE THINKIN'.

37
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:32,041
HE'S ALREADY MISSED
HIS BRAKING POINT.

38
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:33,916
- HE'S GUNNIN' IT LIKE
A BAT OUTTA HELL!

39
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,041
UNREAL! DUDE, NO ONE TAKES THAT
CORNER GOIN' THAT FAST!

40
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:44,750
- ( tires screeching )

41
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:47,916
- SWEET!

42
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,583
- NO WAY! THE EIGHT SIX
IS RIGHT ON TOP OF HIM!

43
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:53,916
- DAMMIT.

44
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:09,416
- YEAH. LOUD N' CLEAR. THANKS.

45
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,000
WORD FROM THE PEANUT GALLERY IS
HE'S REALLY FLYIN' OUT THERE.

46
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:14,958
TAKUMI'S BRAKING TECHNIQUE
HAS EVERYBODY WOWED.

47
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:16,666
- HEY, WHAT DID YOU EXPECT?

48
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,916
OUR BOY'S BEEN
PRACTICING HIS ASS OFF...

49
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,666
PUSHIN' HIS BRAKING TECHNIQUE
TO IT'S LIMIT

50
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,041
OUGHTTA BE SECOND NATURE BY NOW,
DONCHA YOU'D THINK?

51
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:25,083
AFTER ALL, IT'S TAKUMI
WE'RE TALKIN' ABOUT HERE,

52
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:26,375
THE KID'S A GENIUS.

53
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:28,500
- CONSIDER WHAT HE'S
UP AGAINST, THOUGH.

54
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:31,125
THE EIGHT SIX'S BRAKE SYSTEM
HAS BEEN FINE-TUNED

55
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:32,625
WITH AN EMPHASIS
ON THE FRONT END,

56
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:36,541
FOR DOWNHILL AS OPPOSED TO
FLAT-ROAD BRAKING, YES.

57
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:38,916
AND BY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF
THE CAR'S LIGHT WEIGHT,

58
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,500
IT IS POSSIBLE,

59
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:42,416
DEPENDING ON THE DRIVER'S SKILL,
FOR THE BRAKES TO PERFORM BETTER

60
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,500
THAN AN ABS, I'LL GRANT YOU.

61
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:50,541
BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER,

62
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:53,791
THE EVO SIX CAN ACCELERATE LIKE
CRAZY OUT OF THOSE CORNERS.

63
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:58,333
IT WON'T TAKE MUCH FOR TAKUMI
TO GET LEFT BEHIND.

64
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,958
THE BEST WAY FOR HIM TO CLOSE
THE GAP IS TO APPRECIATE

65
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:05,750
WHERE HIS OPPONENT TAKES HIS OWN
BRAKING STYLE FOR GRANTED.

66
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:16,750
- THOUGHT I TOLD YOU TO KEEP IT
LOW-KEY, LITTLE MAN.

67
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:19,250
HEY, IF YOU WANT TO BE THE HERO
GO RIGHT ON AHEAD,

68
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:21,916
JUST DON'T CRY OVER WHAT
HAPPENS TO YOUR BUDDIES.

69
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:28,500
CRAP!

70
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:32,625
DOESN'T MATTER ANYWAY.

71
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:34,083
I SHOULD BE ABLE TO
SHAKE HIM OFF

72
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:36,333
ONCE WE GET TO THE HIGH-SPEED
SECTION IN THE MIDDLE.

73
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:38,750
LET'S SEE WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT
YOUR PRECIOUS LITTLE EIGHT SIX

74
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:40,916
ONCE I'M DONE EMBARRASSING YOU!

75
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,583
- ( engine revving )

76
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:58,583
- HEY, KEISUKE.

77
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:01,416
SO, JUST BEFORE THEY STARTED,
THE GUY TAKUMI'S RACING SAID

78
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,500
SOMETHING I THINK
YOU WANT TO HEAR.

79
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:28,208
- Keisuke: YOU'RE KIDDING.

80
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:29,583
- 'FRAID NOT, MAN.

81
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:31,375
CHANCES ARE THE GUY WAS JUST
TRYIN' TO BLUFF HIS WAY

82
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:32,791
OUT OF A FAIR FIGHT,

83
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:35,500
BUT YOU NEVER KNOW. WE MIGHT BE
IN FOR A FULL-ON BRAWL.

84
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:37,166
- WELL IT WOULDN'T SURPRISE ME.

85
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,583
THEY'RE ALL JUST A
BUNCH OF THUGS.

86
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:40,000
- THIS IS
UN-FRIGGIN'-BELIEVABLE!

87
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:42,333
HOW FAR ARE THOSE LOSERS GONNA
TRY AND PUSH THIS?

88
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:44,916
LET'S ROUND UP SOME TROOPS OF
OUR OWN AND GO AT THESE ASSHOLES

89
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,416
WITH EVERYTHING WE'VE GOT!

90
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,541
YOU KNOW IT'D ONLY TAKE
A PHONE CALL, KEISUKE.

91
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:51,458
- FORGET IT, DUDE. CALM DOWN.
- CALM DOWN?

92
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:54,750
- I THINK MATSUMOTO'S RIGHT.
THE GUY WAS PROBABLY BLUFFIN'.

93
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:56,916
- MAYBE, BUT WHAT IF HE
WAS SERIOUS?

94
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
SUPPOSE THESE JERKS
HAVE BACKUP ON THE WAY.

95
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:01,708
WE'RE GONNA GET
OUR ASSES KICKED!

96
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:03,666
I'M NOT TRYING TO GET
BEAT DOWN TONIGHT.

97
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,708
- YEAH, I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

98
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:08,208
HEY, C'MON, MAN, I'M ONLY
KIDDIN', ALL RIGHT?

99
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:09,583
JUST LIGHTEN UP.

100
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:39,708
- I CAN KEEP UP, NO PROBLEM.

101
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:42,083
HE'S NOT BAD, BUT
I DON'T THINK I'M GONNA LOOSE.

102
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:45,208
IT'S NOT THE CAR
I NEED TO WORRY ABOUT,

103
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:47,541
IT'S THE DRIVER.

104
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:50,833
AND HEY IT'S NOT LIKE THIS GUY
IN THE SAME LEAGUE AS DAD.

105
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:52,750
( scoffing )
NOW THAT WAS TOUGH.

106
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:05,166
COMPARED TO HIM, THIS TOOL
BRAKES LIKE SOMEBODY'S GRANDMA.

107
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:18,458
I THINK, I GOT IT! I THINK I
KNOW WHAT HIS WEAKNESS NOW.

108
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,458
YEAH, IT'S OBVIOUS!

109
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:27,166
- Fumihiro: BUT DOES IT MATTER?

110
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,833
EVEN IF HE WAS BLUFFING,

111
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:30,541
FOR TAKUMI TO HAVE THAT IDEA
PLANTED INTO HIS HEAD

112
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:31,958
AT THE STARTING LINE,

113
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:34,125
I KNOW IT'D THROW ME
OFF MY GAME.

114
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:35,958
IT'S A PRETTY DAMN EFFECTIVE
TACTIC FOR TIPPING THE SCALE

115
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:37,500
IN THEIR FAVOR,
WOULDN'T YOU SAY?

116
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:38,750
- 'COURSE I WOULD...

117
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:40,666
I TRIED TO TELL HIM TO
JUST FOCUS ON THE ROAD.

118
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,750
BUT I DUNNO, YOU COULD
SEE HE WAS PRETTY SHOOK-UP

119
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:44,958
BY THE WHOLE THING.

120
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:48,125
- A SITUATION LIKE THIS WOULD BE
ENOUGH TO THROW ANYBODY.

121
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:49,333
AND ON TOP OF THAT,
WE'RE TALKIN'

122
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:51,291
COMPLETELY NEW
TERRITORY FOR HIM.

123
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:54,041
NO WAY IS HE GONNA BE
ABLE TO FOCUS.

124
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:55,666
- YOU'RE WRONG ABOUT THAT.

125
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:58,500
TAKUMI'S NOT NAIVE ENOUGH TO
FALL FOR THAT CRAP.

126
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:00,583
- I SURE HOPE YOUR RIGHT.

127
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,250
- I AGREE, BRO.

128
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:05,416
ANYONE WHO'S RACED THE KID KNOWS
HE DOESN'T SCARE THAT EASILY.

129
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,500
SURE, HE MAY COME OFF
AS THE QUIET TYPE,

130
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,958
BUT ONCE HE GETS BEHIND
THE WHEEL OF A CAR,

131
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:16,208
TAKUMI'S LEVEL OF CONCENTRATION
IS ABOUT AS GOOD AS IT GETS.

132
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:17,625
IT'S UNGODLY.

133
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:25,833
- THIS DUDE'S BRAKING
TECHNIQUE SUCKS.

134
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:27,791
THAT'S THE CHINK IN HIS ARMOR.

135
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,541
- SON OF A BITCH.

136
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:45,458
THAT HAMSTER-WHEEL PIECE
OF CRAP IS STAYIN ON ME.

137
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:47,041
MAN, THIS LITTLE
PUNK IS STARTING

138
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:49,500
TO GET ON MY LAST
FRIGGIN' NERVE!

139
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:56,458
I GOTTA TAKE IT EASY ON
THIS UPCOMING SECTION.

140
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:59,708
IF HE SCREWS UP AND SIDE SWIPES
ME THEN WE'RE IN FOR SOME SHIT.

141
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:04,500
- HIS LINE CHANGED.

142
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:06,083
LOOKS LIKE THE SPEED I'M
TAKIN' THESE CORNERS AT

143
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:08,208
HAS GOT THIS JERK
PRETTY SPOOKED.

144
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:14,250
- THIS IS ONLY A
WORKING HYPOTHESIS,

145
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:16,875
BUT IF THE EVO SIX WAS TO TAKE
UP A DEFENSIVE POSITION,

146
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:20,083
ITS ENTRY INTO THE CORNERS WOULD
PROBABLY START GETTING TIGHTER.

147
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:24,625
GIVEN THAT, IF THE DRIVER
ISN'T ANTICIPATING AN ATTACK

148
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:29,083
FROM THE OUTSIDE, THAT'S THE
LINE TAKUMI WILL GO WITH.

149
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:43,250
- THE OUTSIDE IS WIDE OPEN.
THAT'S MY IN.

150
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:47,458
- THEY'RE HERE? GOOD, GOOD...

151
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:49,083
WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF
THE RACE RIGHT NOW,

152
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:52,916
SO JUST KEEP 'EM ON STANDBY DOWN
THERE UNTIL IT'S OVER, OKAY?

153
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,833
YEAH, I KNOW. THEY'RE A FREAKY
GROUP OF THUGS AREN'T THEY?

154
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:58,958
MY ADVICE, TREAT 'EM
WITH CRAZY RESPECT.

155
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:02,000
WELL, LOOKS LIKE
THE CALVARY'S ARRIVED.

156
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,250
- THIS WILL BE EPIC.

157
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:17,458
- Ryosuke: HE MAY SEEM
LIKE AN AMATEUR,

158
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:20,000
BUT BY NO MEANS IS THE
EVO SIX'S DRIVER A FOOL.

159
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:22,166
HE HAS HIS CAR PRETTY
WELL EQUIPPED,

160
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,416
AND YOU CAN BE SURE HE KNOWS
HOW TO USE EVERY MODIFICATION

161
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,500
TO HIS BEST POSSIBLE ADVANTAGE.

162
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:30,500
IN TERMS OF BRAKING, HE'S
EXPLOITING THE ABS

163
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:31,541
TO ITS UTMOST.

164
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:33,750
A WISE MOVE ON HIS PART.

165
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:35,958
SEE, ABS' ARE
DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY

166
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:38,583
SO THAT EVEN SOMEONE WITH ONLY A
RUDIMENTARY UNDERSTANDING OF

167
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:40,958
TIRE TRACTION CAN
BRAKE LIKE A PRO.

168
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:46,041
THE QUESTION IS,

169
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:47,833
IF HE'S BECOME SO COMFORTABLE
WITH THE WAY THE CAR HANDLES

170
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:48,958
WHEN CONDITIONS ARE IDEAL,

171
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,166
CAN HE ADAPT WHEN THEY'RE NOT?

172
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,666
IF HE'S NOT ABLE TO,

173
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:55,250
THEN, UNDER PRESSURE, WHERE
AND WHEN HE DECIDES TO BRAKE

174
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:59,208
GOING INTO EACH CORNER CAN PROVE
TO BE HIS BIGGEST LIABILITY.

175
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:01,333
WHETHER OR NOT TAKUMI
CAN SPOT THAT WEAKNESS

176
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:03,875
WILL BE THE DECIDING FACTOR
IN THIS RACE.

177
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:07,666
- TOO SLOW!

178
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:13,458
- PERSISTENT LITTLE BITCH!

179
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:27,208
THE HIGH-SPEED SECTION'S COMING
UP. JUST A LITTLE BIT FURTHER.

180
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,000
ONE MORE CORNER AND
I'LL FINISH THIS THING.

181
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:47,208
- ( tires screeching )

182
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:05,250
- WHAT THE HELL!
WHAT HAPPENED TO MY TRACTION?

183
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,750
- THIS IS IT.

184
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,666
- CRAP. OIL!
SON OF A BITCH!

185
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,208
I MUST HAVE HIT
SOME LEFT OVER SPILL

186
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:30,166
HUGGING THE INSIDE TOO TIGHT.

187
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:46,833
WE'RE NOT AT THE FINISH LINE
YET. I CAN STILL DO THIS.

188
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:50,166
ALL I GOTTA DO IS PASS THE LUCKY
LITTLE BUTT MUNCH ONE MORE TIME!

189
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:59,625
THE NEXT SECTION IS WHERE
I'LL MAKE MY MOVE.

190
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:02,958
THAT EIGHT SIX DOESN'T
HAVE CRAP ON ME, WATCH!

191
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:16,208
THIS BABY HERE IS THE
FASTEST 2.0-LITER TURBO

192
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:17,958
ON THE ROAD, ASSHOLE!

193
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:23,083
NO WAY I'M GONNA LET SOME DINKY,
LITTLE 1.6 SHOW ME UP!

194
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:25,333
- THEY SHOULD BE ON THE
LAST PART OF THE COURSE.

195
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:27,458
THE MID-SPEED SECTION WHERE
THE ROAD WIDENS

196
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:29,875
JUST ENOUGH FOR THEM
TO KICK UP THEIR PACE A NOTCH.

197
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:31,875
- THAT'S WHERE THE EVO
CAN GET HIM, RIGHT?

198
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:33,625
- NAH. YOU GOT IT BACKWARDS.

199
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:35,708
- HUH? WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

200
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,791
- THE HIGHER THE SPEED THE
HARDER IS TO KNOW

201
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:40,833
WHERE TO BRAKE, SO THE RISK
MULTIPLIES BY, LIKE, TENFOLD.

202
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:43,500
THE DIFFERENCE IN HORSEPOWER'S
NOT GONNA MEAN MUCH.

203
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:45,791
AM I RIGHT, OR AM I RIGHT, BRO?

204
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:48,791
- HMM. THINK ABOUT
WHAT I SAID EARLIER.

205
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:51,916
POWER ALONE IS A POOR SURROGATE
FOR TECHNIQUE IN A DOWNHILL RUN

206
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,625
LIKE THE ONE THEY'RE ON.

207
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:05,750
- DAMMIT! IT'S NO GOOD.

208
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:16,250
HE'S GOIN' IN WITHOUT BRAKING?

I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

226
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:25,708
THAT KID IS SOMETHING ELSE.

227
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:51,083
- Fumihiro: I SEE.
THANKS FOR THE WARNING.

228
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:56,166
OKAY GUYS, SOUNDS LIKE
HE WASN'T BLUFFING AFTER ALL.

229
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:59,416
FIVE OR SIX SUSPICIOUS-LOOKING
CARS ARE HEADED OUR WAY.

230
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,708
WHAT DO YOU THINK
WE SHOULD TO RYOSUKE?

231
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:03,666
- WELL, I'D SAY OUR
OPPONENTS HAVE DEFAULTED

232
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,416
ON THE NEXT CHALLENGE.

233
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,916
I WANT ALL OF YOU ON HIGH-ALERT.

234
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,958
BE READY TO PULL
OUT AT ANY TIME.

235
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:12,666
THE SAFETY OF OUR TEAM IS OUR
ONLY CONCERN. SO NO HEROICS, OK?

236
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,500
- YES, SIR.
- RIGHT.

237
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:16,958
- FUMIHIRO, LISTEN TO ME.

238
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:20,041
IF IT COMES DOWN TO IT, KEISUKE
AND I WILL DISTRACT THEM.

239
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:23,500
I WANT YOU TO TAKE THE TEAM, GET
EVERYONE THE HELL OUT OF HERE.

240
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:26,375
- NO CHANCE, WE'RE JUST NOT
LEAVING YOU HERE.

241
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:27,666
- IT ONLY A MATTER OF TIME

242
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,416
BEFORE SOMETHING
LIKE THIS HAPPENED.

243
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,375
I ASSUME THAT RESPONSIBILITY
FOR THAT RISK

244
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:33,833
WHEN I FORMED
PROJECT D, NOT YOU.

245
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:36,791
- YEA DON'T SWEAT IT, DUDE.
I'VE GOT HIS BACK. TRUST ME.

246
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:38,958
BELIEVE OR NOT I'VE BEEN
IN MY SHARE OF FIGHTS.

247
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:41,166
I KNOW HOW TO HANDLE MYSELF.

248
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:44,458
YOU JUST CONCENTRATE ON
GETTING EVERYONE ELSE OUT.

249
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:46,166
- IF THAT'S HOW YOU WANT IT.

250
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:49,291
YOU'RE A DAMN GOOD FRIEND AND
ONE HELL OF A BROTHER, KEISUKE.

251
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:51,041
I HOPE YOU KNOW THAT.

252
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:52,458
- PLEASE, YOU GOTTA LET
ME GO OUT THERE

253
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:53,458
AND THROW DOWN WITH YOU.

254
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:55,125
- HOW 'BOUT I JUST
KICK YOUR ASS?

255
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:56,750
- KINDA TRYIN' TO AVOID THAT.

256
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:59,791
- PROMISE ME YOUR NOT GONNA
LET THEM HURT, RYOSUKE.

257
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:01,375
I WANT YOU TO GIVE ME YOUR WORD.

258
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:03,875
- YOU'VE GOT IT, MAN.
NO WORRIES.

259
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:06,791
- I'M GONNA STAY BEHIND
WITH YOU GUYS?

260
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:10,041
- I APPRECIATE THAT, BUT NO,
WE'LL TAKE IT FROM HERE.

261
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:13,958
- ( vehicles approaching )

262
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:16,916
- HERE THEY COME.

263
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,833
- EVERYBODY GET IN VANS
ONE AND TWO, IMMEDIATELY!

264
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:02,208
- NOTHIN' LIKE A LITTLE
TAILGATE PARTY, EH?

265
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:03,708
( laughing )

266
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:07,333
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE PRETTY BOY
BALLIN' LIKE A BABY GIRL.

267
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:10,250
- OH, NO QUESTION. WHATDYA SAY
YOU GUYS WANT TO JUMP IN

268
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:12,291
AND GIVE THESE GUYS A HAND
WITH THE BEAT DOWN?

269
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:13,875
WE'RE OUT OF CRAP TON
OF MONEY EITHER WAY

270
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:16,541
MIGHT AS WELL ENJOY THIS.

271
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:19,166
SHIT. I COULDA PAID OFF MY
CAR WITH THE CASH I LOST

272
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,458
ON THIS RACE I'M TAKIN' IT
OUT OF SOMEBODY'S ASS.

273
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:23,875
- HELLS YEAH. I AM RIGHT
THERE WITH YOU, MAN.

274
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:26,500
BESIDES, WHO'S GONNA STOP US
FROM GETTING A COUPLE OF PUNCHES

275
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,416
WHILE A WHOLE BUNCH OF
BIKER POUND THESE GUYS

276
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,791
INTO LUNCH MEAT.

277
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:32,166
- I'M SURE THEY WON'T MIND US
HAVING A LITTLE FUN.

278
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,750
- ( all laughing )

279
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,083
- ( gasping ) HOLY CRAP.
LOOK AT THIS GUY!

280
00:19:58,166 --> 00:20:00,125
- I HEAR THE GANG HE
USED TO LEAD

281
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:02,375
RAN THE NORTHERN KATOU REGION'S
UNDERGROUND WITH AN IRON FIST.

282
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:04,875
HE'S KNOWN ALL OVER AS THE DUDE
YOU DO NOT WANT TO CROSS.

283
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:06,166
- UH-HUH.

284
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,416
- JUST SIT TIGHT, BRO.
I'LL HANDLE THIS.

285
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:48,041
- ( laughing )

286
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:18,291
- ( gasping )

287
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:24,625
- I HAD A FEELIN' IT'D BE YOU.

288
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:26,208
- HUH?

289
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:27,583
- MY BAD, K-DOG.

290
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:29,958
IT'S SO DARK OUT HERE I
ALMOST DIDN'T RECOGNIZE YA.

291
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:31,833
GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN, SIR.

292
00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:36,750
- WHY THE HELL IS A GUY LIKE YOU
HANGING OUT WITH THESE LOSERS?

293
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:38,750
FRIENDS HARD TO COME BY THESE
DAYS, OR WHAT?

294
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:40,833
- NO, I UH...

295
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:43,791
I'M JUST ON THE CLOCK, YA KNOW,
IT'S NOT LIKE I RUN WITH 'EM.

296
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:46,250
THIS IS STRICTLY
A THIRD-PARTY THING.

297
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:48,375
- ( gulping )

298
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:49,833
- NOW THAT I'M HERE, THOUGH,

299
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:52,375
LOOKS LIKE THESE JERKOFFS
HAVE BEEN DISRESPECTING YOU.

300
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:53,750
AM I RIGHT?

301
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:55,291
- ( gasping in fear )

302
00:21:55,375 --> 00:21:58,250
- KINDA, YEAH. BUT AS FAR AS
