WHAT SHOULD WE BE ON THE
LOOKOUT FOR?

8
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,458
- I COULDN'T REALLY SAY
FOR SURE.

9
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:21,458
BUT IT'D SUCK TO BE
KEISUKE RIGHT NOW.

10
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:23,666
- HUH? WAIT... SERIOUSLY?

11
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,333
IS IT A TOUGH DOWNHILL?

12
00:02:25,416 --> 00:02:27,083
I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS TOO BAD.

13
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:28,916
- NO. THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEAN...

14
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:32,500
OK, HOW SHOULD I PUT THIS?

15
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:35,166
TUNING YOUR CAR TO TACKLE A HILL
CLIMB IS GOOD AND ALL...

16
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,666
BUT SOONER OR LATER
YOUR GONNA HAVE TO

17
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,125
COME BACK DOWN THE
MOUNTAIN, RIGHT?

18
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,625
- YEAH.

19
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:41,791
- BUT UNLIKE OTHERS WITH THAT
KIND OF TUNING...

20
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:44,416
KEISUKE'S SKILLS AREN'T LIMITED
TO HILL CLIMBING

21
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,125
BECAUSE LATELY HE'S BEEN
DRIVING DOWNHILL

22
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:48,083
JUST AS MUCH AS HE'S BEEN
DRIVING UPHILL.

23
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:50,666
- THEN THE SAME OUGHT BE
TRUE FOR YOU THEN, AM I RIGHT?

24
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,333
- WELL... THERE'S A BIG
DIFFERENCE IN HORSE POWER.

25
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:55,708
IF WE WERE ON A HILL CLIMB,
THE FD WOULD HAVE THE ADVANTAGE

26
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:58,500
OVER THE EIGHT-SIX,
HANDS DOWN.

27
00:02:58,583 --> 00:03:00,833
DOWNHILL... HELL, EVEN THEN
THE FD WOULD PROBABLY

28
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:02,416
GIVE ME A
RUN FOR MY MONEY.

29
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,500
ALL THINGS CONSIDERED, THERE'S
NOT MUCH DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ME

30
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:05,916
AND KEISUKE WHEN WE'RE
ON THE ROAD.

31
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,250
- REALLY, I HAD NO IDEA.

32
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:10,500
- KEEP AN EYE ON HIM DURING
PRACTICE SOME TIME,

33
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:12,750
AND YOU'LL SEE WHAT I'M
TALKING ABOUT.

34
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:14,250
I MEAN I'M GLAD HE'S
IMPROVING AND ALL...

35
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:16,416
BUT I CAN'T SAY I'M EXACTLY
THRILLED ABOUT IT.

36
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:21,291
IN FACT, I'M KINDA GETTING
FREAKED OUT.

37
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:23,458
IF KEISUKE GOES ALL OUT
ON THE DOWNHILL

38
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:25,375
WE'RE FINALLY GOING TO SEE WHAT
HE'S CAPABLE OF

39
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:28,041
AND I'M WORRIED THAT
I MIGHT NOT MEASURE UP.

40
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,541
- I KNOW HE'S UP
THERE SOMEWHERE...

41
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:57,166
COME ON, OLD MAN...

42
00:03:57,916 --> 00:03:59,166
WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU?

43
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:14,708
- IT DOESN'T TAKE A GENIUS TO
FIGURE OUT YOUR GAME.

44
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:17,541
YOU'RE WAITING FOR THE DOWNHILL,
AREN'T YOU?

45
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:20,375
BUT DON'T COUNT YOUR CHICKENS
JUST YET.

46
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:22,125
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE
ON THIS COURSE

47
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:24,666
WHO'S GOT A COUPLE TRICKS
UP HIS SLEEVE.

48
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:29,916
I GOTTA KEEP MY CONCENTRATION...

49
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,833
TRY NOT TO OVERTHINK THIS,
JUST KEEP YOURSELF TALKING.

50
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:36,500
- ( groans )

51
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:40,000
- DESPITE WHAT SOME OF YOU
MAY THINK,

52
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:42,625
SIX SECONDS ISN'T MUCH OF
A DIFFERENCE.

53
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:45,250
BUT STILL, THE FD BETTER CATCH
UP SOON.

54
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:48,125
IF HE ISN'T CAREFUL, THE GT-R
MIGHT WIN THIS THING

55
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:49,458
ON THE FIRST RUN...

56
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:51,666
NOT TO SAY, WINNING WOULD
BOTHER ME.

57
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:57,416
IT ALMOST SEEMS TOO EASY.

58
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,458
- OK, BUT WHAT IF THE FD
CATCHES UP?

59
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:02,208
IT'S JUST GONNA PUSH THE BATTLE
INTO A SECOND ROUND, RIGHT?

60
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:04,041
- IT'S NOT THAT CUT AND DRIED.

61
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:06,833
IF THE BATTLE HASN'T BEEN
DECIDED BY THE FIRST RUN...

62
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:10,791
HOSHINO WILL BE AT AN INCREDIBLE
DISADVANTAGE DURING THE SECOND.

63
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,041
I GUARANTEE IT.

64
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:14,625
THE FD WILL BE ABLE TO TAKE THE
LEAD SOMEWHERE.

65
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:15,916
- ( gasping )

66
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,500
- YOU FOLLOWING ME?

67
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,333
BOTH THE CHASER AND THE
CHASED KNOW

68
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:20,708
THESE ARE SOME
PRETTY HIGH STAKES

69
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:23,041
WE'RE PLAYING FOR HERE, BOYS.

70
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:25,041
THIS BATTLE IS IN A DEAD HEAT...

71
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:27,583
AND IN A RACE LIKE THIS EVERY
SECOND MAKES A DIFFERENCE

72
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:29,250
ON THIS COURSE.

73
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:30,750
( engines revving )

74
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:35,625
- OKAY... HERE IT COMES...

75
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:44,333
- DID YOU SEE THAT? HE USED THE
OTHER SIDE OF THE GUTTER

76
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:46,041
TO WHIP AROUND THE CORNER.

77
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:50,708
- THAT'S A PRETTY AGGRESSIVE
MOVE TO MAKE IN A GTR...

78
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:52,916
AND NOT TO MENTION DANGEROUS.

79
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,875
HE MUST BE TRYING TO KEEP
THE FD OUT OF SIGHT.

80
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:58,125
HOSHINO KNOWS HE'S GOT TO
DO EVERYTHING HE CAN

81
00:05:58,208 --> 00:06:00,250
TO FINISH THIS BATTLE
ON THE FIRST RUN.

82
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:01,708
- ( tires screeching )
- HEAR THAT?

83
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:03,416
THAT'S GOT TO BE THE FD!

84
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:13,833
- WHOA, AM I SEEING THINGS
OR DID THE FD JUST PULL OFF

85
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:15,708
THE EXACT SAME MOVE?

86
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:17,875
- YOU'VE HEARD THAT OLD SAYING,

87
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:20,291
"GREAT MINDS THINK
ALIKE" HAVEN'T YOU.

88
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:23,250
THIS IS GETTING PRETTY TOUGH...

89
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:25,708
AND IT ISN'T GOING TO LET UP
ANY TIME SOON.

90
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,791
WHEN YOU'RE ALREADY PLAYING
CATCH UP THIS EARLY ON,

91
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:30,666
YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO WASTE TIME
OUT THERE.

92
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,916
I HATE WHEN I'M UNDER
THAT KIND OF PRESSURE...

93
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,500
GIVE ME AN OLD SCHOOL NOSE TO
TAIL BATTLE ANYDAY.

94
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:03,416
- OH HELL YES!

95
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,458
FOUND YOU.

96
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,875
FOUR SECONDS... IT MIGHT EVEN
BE LESS THAN THAT.

97
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:13,291
I KNOW I CLOSED THE GAP
FROM THE TURNAROUND.

98
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:16,958
I HOPE YOU'RE READY FOR THIS,
GOD FOOT...

99
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:19,250
I'M ABOUT TO DETHRONE YOUR ASS.

100
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:25,750
- MAN HE'S REALLY
POURIN' IT ON...

101
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:27,333
THE KID'S BETTER THAN I THOUGHT.

102
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:36,875
I MAY BE AN OLD MAN,
BUT I'M NO IDIOT...

103
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:39,708
IT WAS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME
BEFORE YOU CLOSED THAT GAP.

104
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:44,583
LOOKS LIKE IT'S
THAT KIND OF BATTLE.

105
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:46,208
LITTLE GIVE... LITTLE TAKE...

106
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:48,083
TOO BAD I'M NOT IN A
GIVING MOOD!

107
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:50,833
YEAH!

108
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:53,416
- NICE TRY, BUT YOU'RE
NOT LOSING ME AGAIN!

109
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:06,000
- HOSHINO MUST BE SWEATING MORE
THAN I AM RIGHT ABOUT NOW.

110
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,375
- MAN... THIS IS
GETTING ROUGH...

111
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:13,666
I CAN'T HOLD OUT FOR TOO
MUCH LONGER.

112
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:17,541
THIS KID IS PRETTY GOOD...

113
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:19,333
EVEN IF HE IS FROM GUNMA!

114
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,250
DAMN! HE'S CATCHING UP...

115
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:23,541
RACING DOWNHILL IS NO EASY
FEAT AND HE ACTS LIKE

116
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:25,625
HE'S BEEN DOING IT FOR YEARS.

117
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,875
- YES...! I'M DEFINITELY
CLOSING THE GAP!

118
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:34,541
- MAN, I'M HAVING A BLAST
OUT HERE!

119
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:37,083
I CAN'T REMEMBER THE LAST TIME
I FELT THIS GOOD.

120
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:40,208
BUT IT'S TIME TO WIN THIS THING!

121
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:50,208
- ( sighs )

122
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:51,958
- I REALLY HOPE THIS WORKS...

123
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:53,208
THERE'S JUST SO MANY
DIFFERENT WAYS

124
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:55,458
THIS COULD TOTALLY BLOW
UP IN OUR FACES.

125
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:57,583
I CAN'T HELP BUT THINK THERE'S
A REASON WE'VE NEVER TRIED

126
00:08:57,666 --> 00:08:59,250
A STRATEGY LIKE THIS BEFORE.

127
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:00,750
- DON'T GET ME WRONG, FUMIHIRO.

128
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:02,541
I CAN TOTALLY SEE WHAT
YOU'RE GETTING AT.

129
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,458
BUT ADMIT IT, IF ANYBODY
COULD PULL OFF SOMETHING

130
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:08,458
THIS DANGEROUS, IT'D HAVE TO
BE KEISUKE? WOULDN'T IT?

131
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:11,916
- AT BEST, WE HAVE ONLY A 50/50
SHOT OF WINNING TONIGHT...

132
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,208
IF IT WORKS OUT LIKE
WE PLANNED.

133
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:16,750
YOU CAN COUNT ON HOSHINO
TO BE UNPREDICTABLE.

134
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:30,125
- WAY TOO MUCH ON THE
UNDER STEER...

135
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:33,625
IT'S GETTING HARDER TO KEEP
HER STEADY.

136
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:35,833
DRIVING A HEAVIER CAR HAS
FINALLY HAS COME BACK

137
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:37,166
TO BITE ME IN THE ASS!

138
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,333
I OUGHT TO KNOW BETTER

139
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:41,041
THAN TO OVERUSE THE FRONT
TIRES LIKE THAT.

140
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:07,208
I DON'T KNOW HOW BUT HE'S
ALMOST CAUGHT UP WITH ME.

141
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:08,500
I'M STILL IN THE LEAD.

142
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:11,916
I JUST WANT A LITTLE MORE
DISTANCE BETWEEN US.

143
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,375
SEE YOU LATER, PUNK!

144
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:25,083
- JUST ONE MORE...

145
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:28,916
ONE MORE CURVE...

146
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,125
NOW GET OUT THE WAY, GRANDPA!

147
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:36,250
- YEAH RIGHT...
I DON'T THINK SO!

148
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:46,708
- HEY GUYS, I THINK I HEAR
THEM COMING.

149
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:48,500
THEY'RE MAKING THE FINAL CORNER!

150
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:56,250
- ( all gasp )

151
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:58,416
- OH CRAP! HE'S TOO CLOSE!

152
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,000
- HOSHINO...

153
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,083
DAMN IT. I COULDN'T PULL
IT OFF.

154
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:17,958
- COOL... THANKS!

155
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:20,166
HEY, KEISUKE JUST STARTED
THE SECOND RUN.

156
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:26,291
- I... I CAN'T BELIEVE
WHAT JUST HAPPENED.

157
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:28,208
I THOUGHT HE HAD A CRAZY LEAD...

158
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:31,541
HOW IN THE HELL DID HOSHINO NOT
DEMOLISH THAT FD?

159
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:33,625
- WHAT WENT WRONG, SIR?

160
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:36,666
- GENTLEMEN, THERE'S NO NEED
FOR YOU TO BE SO DRAMATIC...

161
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:40,291
HOSHINO'S OPPONENT DEFINITELY
ISN'T YOUR TYPICAL STREET RACER.

162
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,208
HE'S A WORTHY ADVERSARY...

163
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:47,791
AND HIS SKILL LEVEL CERTAINLY
SURPASSES OUR EXPECTATIONS.

164
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:50,291
NOW, I'M NOT ONE FOR DOLING
OUT COMPLIMENTS...

165
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:53,500
BUT I'M ACTUALLY IMPRESSED...
AND THAT'S SAYING SOMETHING.

166
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:55,875
- WAIT A SEC...
YOU'RE COMPLIMENTING THE JERK

167
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:57,333
WHO WANTS TO BEAT US ON
OUR OWN COURSE?

168
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:59,625
- YEAH. AND THIS GUY IS ALREADY
LEADING ON THIS RUN.

169
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,708
YOU SAID IT
YOURSELF, JOUSHIMA...

170
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:04,375
IF PROJECT D FORCES A
SECOND RUN,

171
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:06,500
THEY HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OVER US.

172
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:08,833
- I'M WELL AWARE OF WHAT
I SAID EARLIER...

173
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:11,208
BUT YOU HAVE TO ROLL
WITH THE PUNCHES, BOYS.

174
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:15,291
KOUZOU HOSHINO LIVES FOR
THESE MOMENTS...

175
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:18,250
THIS IS WHERE YOU'LL GET TO SEE
HIM REALLY SHINE.

176
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:25,375
- HERE WE GO!

177
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:26,750
STARTING THE SECOND RUN!

178
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:28,625
IN FIVE...!

179
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:29,833
FOUR...

180
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,000
THREE...

181
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,083
TWO...

182
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:33,125
ONE...

183
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:34,875
GO!

184
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:46,708
- THE FIRST RUN WENT EXACTLY
AS PLANNED.

185
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:49,625
NO TELLING HOW THE SECOND
WILL PLAY OUT...

186
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:51,625
THERE ARE A LOT OF VARIABLES
TO CONSIDER...

187
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:55,916
OUR OPPONENT IN PARTICULAR.

188
00:12:57,583 --> 00:12:59,666
I KNOW ONE THING FOR CERTAIN...

189
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:00,791
THIS WON'T BE EASY.

190
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,166
- ( music Playing )

191
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,833
- I GET IT, YOU OLD FOSSIL...

192
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:33,625
YOU'VE GOT BETTER TRACTION
THAN ME.

193
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:35,291
- WHAT'S WRONG, ANKLE BITER?

194
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:37,041
IS THAT REALLY ALL YOU GOT?

195
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:40,083
I MEAN I KNOW ROTARIES ARE CRAP,
BUT THIS IS JUST WEAK!

196
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:45,833
- YOU CAN PRESSURE ME ALL YOU
WANT, BUT IT WON'T WORK!

197
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:47,958
I AM NOT LETTING YOU PASS ME.

198
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:51,375
I JUST HAVE TO KEEP HIM
BEHIND ME.

199
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:53,166
AT LEAST UNTIL THE TURNAROUND.

200
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:56,250
IF I CAN DO THAT, THIS RACE
IS MINE.

201
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:58,208
HE WON'T BEAT ME
ON THE DOWNHILL!

202
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:08,625
- THE SECOND RUN'S STARTED.

203
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:10,750
- SURE HAS.

204
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:12,291
- THAT WAS INSANE.

205
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:16,083
I'VE NEVER SEEN A FD MOVE SO
FAST ON A DOWNHILL LIKE THAT.

206
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:19,250
LOOKS TO ME THE PURPLE SHADOW
IS OFFICIALLY SCREWED.

207
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:21,208
EACH TEAM HAS A LARGE CAR...

208
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:23,750
PASSING ON AN UPHILL IS DAMN
NEAR IMPOSSIBLE.

209
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:25,125
THEY PLAY THEIR CARDS RIGHT,

210
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:27,708
AND PROJECT D MIGHT ACTUALLY
HAVE A SHOT AT THIS.

211
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:29,500
THEY'VE REALLY THOUGHT
EVERYTHING THROUGH...

212
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:31,166
RYOSUKE'S A GENIUS.

213
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:33,500
- YEAH, MAYBE.

214
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:35,916
I DON'T KNOW...
SOMETHING JUST FEELS OFF.

215
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,500
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
SOMETHING'S OFF?

216
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:40,708
I'M NOT SAYING RYOSUKE'S TACTIC
WASN'T BRILLIANT OR ANYTHING...

217
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:41,916
NOT AT ALL.

218
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,625
I JUST FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE
THAT SOMEONE

219
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:44,875
LIKE KOUZOU HOSHINO,

220
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:46,666
A GUY WHO'S BEEN IN RACE AFTER
RACE FOR YEARS,

221
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,375
COULDN'T SEE THIS COMING.

222
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:51,291
AND ANOTHER THING...

223
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:53,416
HE CHOSE TO TAKE THE LEAD ON
THE FIRST GO.

224
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,541
I THINK HE COULD HAVE WON IF HE
PUSHED IT.

225
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:57,375
MAYBE I'M BEING CRAZY.
I DON'T KNOW...

226
00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:59,125
BUT SOMETHING TELLS ME
THAT THIS IS ALL PART

227
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:00,666
OF A MUCH BIGGER PLAN...

228
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:03,333
GOD FOOT'S UP TO SOMETHING MAN,
I CAN FEEL IT.

229
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:05,041
- YEAH, YOU MIGHT BE RIGHT.

230
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:07,208
HE'S GOT TO BE WORKING
SOME KIND OF ANGLE.

231
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:09,833
I HEAR HOSHINO IS ALL
ABOUT STRATEGIZING.

232
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:12,666
IF THERE'S A WAY FOR HIM TO GET
BACK ON TOP, HE'LL FIND IT.

233
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:16,625
PASSING ON A HILL CLIMB
IS DIFFICULT,

234
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:18,500
BUT IT'S NOT UNACHIEVABLE...

235
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:20,458
GOD FOOT ISN'T DONE YET.

236
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:21,750
NOT BY A LONG SHOT.

237
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:35,625
- HERE WE GO!

238
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:44,541
- NICE TRY...

239
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:47,125
I DON'T CARE HOW MUCH POWER
THAT BOAT YOU'RE DRIVING HAS,

240
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:49,291
NO WAY YOU'RE GOING TO PASS
ME HERE.

241
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:56,541
- I SEE HOW YOU ARE.

242
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:58,625
WELL, TWO CAN PLAY
AT THAT GAME!

243
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:07,875
- ( crowd chattering anxiously )

244
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:14,916
- CRAP.

245
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,416
WHAT'S WITH THOSE GUYS?

246
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,708
IF I DIDN'T KNOW ANY BETTER,

247
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:20,958
I'D THINK THEY'D NEVER BEEN
TO A RACE BEFORE.

248
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:22,375
WAKE UP MORONS...

249
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:24,125
NO WAY KEISUKE CAN LOSE.

250
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:27,208
DRIVING ON MOUNTAIN PASSES SURE
AS HELL ISN'T A CAKE WALK.

251
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:28,958
AND I WOULD KNOW.

252
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:30,250
YOU'D HAVE TO BE OUT
OF YOUR GOURD

253
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:32,291
TO TRY TO PASS ON THIS COURSE.

254
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:36,250
IT SHOULDN'T BE TOO MUCH LONGER
BEFORE THEY HIT THE TURNAROUND.

255
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:38,625
AND ONCE THEY DO, OUR
FD WILL BE IN THE LEAD.

256
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:41,333
HE'LL BURN RIGHT THROUGH HERE
AND MURDER IT ON THE DOWNHILL.

257
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:43,666
THERE'S NO STOPPING HIM...

258
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,625
KEISUKE'S GONNA TO CRUSH THAT
FOOT GOD!

259
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:05,041
- THE TURNAROUND'S COMING UP...

260
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:06,541
WE'RE ALMOST TO THE TOP!

261
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:09,125
NO QUESTION NOW...
I'M GONNA WIN THIS THING!

262
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:13,833
- HEY, CHECK IT OUT GUYS!

263
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:15,375
THEY'RE COMING AROUND THE TURN!

264
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:20,125
- ALRIGHT!

265
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:39,000
- OH CRAP, THEY'RE COMING
IN SIDE BY SIDE.

266
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,166
- THE HELL IS HE DOING?!

267
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:48,500
- ( music playing )

268
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:14,625
- HOSHINO TOOK THE LEAD!

269
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:16,250
- I DON'T BELIEVE IT...

270
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:18,375
WHAT THE HELL...

271
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:19,583
I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYBODY
GET IN THE LEAD

272
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:22,333
BY PULLING A CRAZY STUNT
LIKE THAT BEFORE.

273
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:25,458
- MAN, THE GT-R DIDN'T HESITATE
FOR EVEN A SECOND.

274
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:27,166
HE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT HE
WAS DOING.

275
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,291
TOOK ONE HELL OF A RISK, BUT
IT SURE DID PAY OFF.

276
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:31,375
- IF KEISUKE HADN'T REACTED
IN THE NICK OF TIME,

277
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:33,833
WE'D ALL BE STANDING IN BURNING
WRECKAGE RIGHT NOW!

278
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:36,250
NO FAIR! THAT GUY'S
A DAMN CHEATER!

279
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:38,208
- THAT WASN'T CHANCE...

280
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:40,916
THEIR TURNS WERE ALMOST IN
PERFECT SYNC.

281
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,500
HE ONLY HAD ABOUT A TENTH OF A
SECOND TO MAKE HIS MOVE.

282
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:46,083
BUT HE KNEW KEISUKE WOULD HAVE
TO WIDEN HIS TURN...

283
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:49,125
WHICH GAVE HOSHINO THE PERFECT
OPPORTUNITY TO REGAIN THE LEAD.

284
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:55,375
- GAUGING TIMES WHEN YOU'RE
COMING OUT OF CORNERS

285
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:57,375
ISN'T EASY BY ANY MEANS...

286
00:18:57,458 --> 00:19:00,375
BUT I THINK I'VE PROVED
IT'S WORTH IT.

287
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:02,125
- I DIDN'T SEE
THAT ONE COMING...

288
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:04,000
NOW I HAVE TO PASS HIM.

289
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:06,333
- I JUST GOT WORD THAT HOSHINO
OVER TOOK KEISUKE

290
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:07,541
AT THE TURNAROUND.

291
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:10,208
- ( sighs ) IT'S LIKE I THOUGHT.

292
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:12,916
GUYS LIKE HIM AREN'T GONNA GO
DOWN WITHOUT A FIGHT.

293
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,291
- WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSE TO
DO NOW...?

294
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:16,208
HOSHINO HAS GOT A DEFINITE
ADVANTAGE OVER US.

295
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:18,583
- I KNOW...
BUT WE'LL MAKE DO.

296
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:20,875
KEISUKE JUST HAS TO TRUST
HIS INSTINCTS.

297
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:24,250
WE'RE NOT QUITE OUT
OF THE WOODS YET,

298
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:26,875
BUT AS LONG AS HE MAINTAINS HIS
FOCUS AND KEEPS AN EYE OUT

299
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:29,500
FOR AN OPENING HE'S STILL
GOT A SHOT.

300
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:31,791
THERE ARE LIMITLESS
POSSIBILITIES HERE.

301
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:34,625
- COME ON, HOSHINO.
YOU'VE COME THIS FAR.

302
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:37,708
- WE CAN'T AFFORD TO MAKE
ANY MISTAKES .

303
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:39,875
JUST KEEP YOURSELF TALKING.

304
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:54,541
- DRIFTING, HUH?

305
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:56,416
FINE. WE'LL DO IT YOUR WAY.

306
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,125
- WHAT THE HELL?

307
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:05,708
- THEY SAID HOSHINO GOT
THE LEAD AT THE TURNAROUND!

308
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:08,291
- SWEET, DUDE...! DOESN'T
GET MUCH BETTER THAN THIS!

309
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:09,666
- YOU HEAR THAT...?

310
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,791
I TOLD YOU HOSHINO WAS UP
TO SOMETHING, DIDN'T I?

311
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:13,958
- THEY'RE COMING!

312
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:18,250
- IT'S A DRIFT ON DRIFT.
THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE!

313
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:19,750
- THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE!

314
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:22,000
EVERYBODY KNOWS GT-R'S
CAN'T DRIFT!

315
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:24,833
HOSHINO'S A FREAKING MAD MAN
TRYING SOMETHING LIKE THAT!

316
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:27,250
- I DON'T GET IT, WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON OUT THERE?

317
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:30,125
- MY GUESS IS... HOSHINO STARTED
DRIFTING TO SEE IF KEISUKE

318
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:31,666
HAD THE BALLS TO KEEP UP.

319
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:34,291
THE GTR'S TIRES ARE BOUND TO BE
LOSING THEIR GRIP BY NOW...

320
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:36,666
WHICH IS GONNA TO CAUSE SOME
PROBLEMS IN THE TIGHTER SPOTS

321
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,375
UNDER STEERING HAS
PROBABLY ALREADY BECOME

322
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:39,791
AN ISSUE ON CORNERS.

323
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:41,833
I BET HE THINKS DRIFTING IS THE
BEST WAY TO CONTROL IT.

324
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:44,666
SO IT DOESN'T TAKE TOO MUCH
TOLL ON THE FRONT END.

325
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,208
SOUNDS A LITTLE HARD
TO BELIEVE,

326
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:48,083
BUT IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT,
IT MAKES SENSE.

327
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:50,708
ON TOP OF THAT,

328
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,708
THIS ROAD IS PRETTY
NARROW, RIGHT?

329
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:55,083
IF HOSHINO WAS TO SWING OUT
THAT GT-R,

330
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:56,875
HE COULD BLOCK THE ENTIRE ROAD.

331
00:20:56,958 --> 00:21:00,625
PASSING WOULD BE VIRTUALLY
IMPOSSIBLE WITH OVER STEERING.

332
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:03,458
NOBODY COULD GET THROUGH THAT,
FD OR OTHERWISE.

333
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:17,791
- I HADN'T INTENDED TO PULL OUT
THE FLASHY STUFF LIKE THIS...

334
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:21,000
BUT IF THAT'S HOW THE KID WANTS
TO PLAY, THEN I'M ALL FOR IT.

335
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:23,375
THESE PEOPLE CAME OUT HERE TO
SEE A RACE...

336
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:24,750
LET'S GIVE 'EM ONE!

337
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:28,458
SOMETHING THEY CAN TELL THEIR
GRANDKIDS ABOUT.

338
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:31,250
- THEY'RE SAY BOTH CARS HAVE
STARTED TO DRIFT.

339
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:33,875
JOUSHIMA, YOU HAVE ANY CLUE WHY
HE WOULD DO THAT?

340
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:35,291
- I DON'T GET IT.

341
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:37,000
I THOUGHT IT WAS COMMON SENSE
TO DO WHATEVER YOU COULD

342
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:38,541
TO SAVE YOUR TIRES...

343
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:43,375
BUT BOTH THE GT-R AND THE FD
ARE WEARING THE HELL OF THEM!

344
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:45,416
- WHEN IT COMES TO BEING
BEHIND THE WHEEL,

345
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:49,083
COMMON SENSE CAN SOMETIMES
TAKE A BACK SEAT TO LOGIC.

346
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:51,500
THE TWO OF THEM ARE
ALIKE IN THAT WAY.

347
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:54,333
WE HAVEN'T HAD A DULL
MOMENT SO FAR TONIGHT.

348
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:57,000
THIS JUST KEEPS GETTING
BETTER AND BETTER.

349
00:21:58,166 --> 00:22:00,041
BOTH HAVE SOMETHING TO PROVE.

350
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:02,458
AND EITHER COULD WIN.

351
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:04,083
- THERE'S A
PERFECTLY LOGICAL REASON

352
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:06,541
WHY KOUZOU HOSHINO
BEGAN TO DRIFT.

353
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:11,500
KEISUKE, HOWEVER... SIMPLY FELT
THE NEED TO FOLLOW SUIT.

354
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:14,125
NOT SURPRISING...

355
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:16,250
HE LOVES TO BE STUBBORN.

356
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:18,250
HE'D RATHER GIVE INTO HIS
IMPULSE THAN TO THINK ABOUT THIS

357
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:20,958
FROM A LOGICAL
POINT OF VIEW.

358
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:23,458
COUNTERING A DRIFT WITH A DRIFT?

359
00:22:23,541 --> 00:22:26,000
IF THERE'S ONE THING THAT
KOUZOU HOSHINO AND KEISUKE

360
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:27,291
HAVE IN COMMON,
IT'S THEIR ABILITY

361
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:30,250
TO BE STUBBORN TO
THE POINT OF IRRATIONALITY.

362
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:33,208
THAT'S HOW THIS WHOLE
THING STARTED.

363
00:22:33,291 --> 00:22:35,375
AND I SINCERELY DOUBT THAT
EITHER ONE OF THEM IS WILLING

364
00:22:35,458 --> 00:22:37,083
TO SWALLOW THEIR PRIDE
AND END THIS.

365
00:22:51,458 --> 00:22:52,708
- DAMN IT, THE TIRES.

366
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,916
- I WOULD IMAGINE YOU'RE
FEELING PRETTY GOOD

367
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,083
ABOUT NOW, HOSHINO.

368
00:23:00,166 --> 00:23:03,416
BUT THE GT-R CAN'T CONTINUE TO
DRIFT LIKE THIS.

369
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,666
YOU KNOW THAT AS WELL AS I DO.

370
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:08,625
FROM THE WEIGHT OF THE CAR TO
THE WEAR ON THE TIRES,

371
00:23:08,708 --> 00:23:11,750
I DON'T THINK THIS RACE CAN GO
ON MUCH LONGER.

372
00:23:11,833 --> 00:23:13,791
- IT SHOULDN'T BE
TOO LONG NOW...

373
00:23:13,875 --> 00:23:17,166
KEISUKE'S GOT TO HAVE AN ACE UP
HIS SLEEVE.

374
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:19,458
BUT I'M GETTING AHEAD
OF MYSELF...

375
00:23:19,541 --> 00:23:21,208
WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING FOR SURE.

376
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:33,416
- CRAP! IT'S VEERING TO
THE OUTSIDE ON ITS OWN!

377
00:24:43,041 --> 00:24:44,208
- ( tires screeching )

378
00:24:58,875 --> 00:25:00,666
- I KNEW HE COULD DO IT!

379
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:29,041
- ( theme song playing )

380
00:25:29,125 --> 00:25:31,333
- ( singing in Japanese )

381
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:18,416
- ♪ NOBODY REASON ♪

382
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:22,166
♪ NOBODY IS SURE
WHERE IS THE END ♪

00:26:47,333 --> 00:26:50,833
