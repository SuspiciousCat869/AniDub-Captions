[Narrator] Out of the
Digi-destined children

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.917
only Tai and Matt were left
behind in the Digital World.

00:01:48.085 --> 00:01:50.087
While Sora and the
others found themselves

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.622
mysteriously sent back
to the real world.

00:01:54.424 --> 00:01:57.227
Tai and Matt come across
Leomon and his army

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.629
who fight back against
the threat of Devimon.

00:02:00.964 --> 00:02:03.900
Together they raid
Bulbmon who carries cargo

00:02:03.934 --> 00:02:06.269
related to the
Celestial Digimon.

00:02:10.941 --> 00:02:15.746
The identity of the precious
cargo turns out to be...

00:02:15.779 --> 00:02:18.615
(emotional music)

00:02:28.658 --> 00:02:29.659
TK!

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:31.962
Wake up!

00:02:31.995 --> 00:02:33.597
TK!

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.599
Wait, is that Matt's brother?

00:02:35.632 --> 00:02:36.800
What is he doing here?

00:02:38.135 --> 00:02:39.770
(Tai groans in pain)

00:02:39.803 --> 00:02:41.438
Now what?

00:02:41.471 --> 00:02:43.774
(growls) This power must be...

00:02:43.807 --> 00:02:46.610
(glass cracks)

00:02:46.643 --> 00:02:49.346
(dramatic music)

00:02:57.988 --> 00:02:58.989
Huh?

00:03:06.363 --> 00:03:09.166
(Velgemon roars)

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.702
(glass shatters)

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:20.010
TK, no!

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:29.653
(air blasts)

00:03:29.686 --> 00:03:33.023
Come on, we've got
to get out of here!

00:03:34.724 --> 00:03:38.395
(Leomon yells determinedly)

00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:49.206
(Velgemon roars)

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.013
[Tai] What in the
world is that thing?

00:03:57.047 --> 00:03:58.548
And how is it this powerful?

00:04:04.421 --> 00:04:05.889
That's Velgemon,

00:04:05.922 --> 00:04:09.226
the dark beast rumored to
be able to swallow the dead

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:11.194
in ancient legends.

00:04:11.228 --> 00:04:13.864
So, even a Digimon
as strong as that

00:04:13.897 --> 00:04:15.565
is lending its power to Devimon.

00:04:16.766 --> 00:04:20.103
(Matt grunts worriedly)

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:28.211
(air whooshes)

00:04:28.245 --> 00:04:31.214
(Matt and Leomon gasp)

00:04:31.248 --> 00:04:32.415
TK!

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:34.050
Let's go Garurumon!

00:04:34.084 --> 00:04:35.085
Right!

00:04:35.952 --> 00:04:37.220
You ready for this, Greymon?

00:04:37.254 --> 00:04:38.255
[Greymon] Yeah!

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.425
(explosion)

00:04:46.463 --> 00:04:47.597
Megadramon.

00:04:53.136 --> 00:04:56.573
(Leomon grunts)

00:04:56.606 --> 00:05:00.443
Fist of the Beast King!

00:05:00.477 --> 00:05:02.812
(explosion)

00:05:04.948 --> 00:05:07.584
I'll do my best to
keep this one busy.

00:05:07.617 --> 00:05:08.919
Leave him to me.

00:05:08.952 --> 00:05:10.420
You follow Velgemon.

00:05:10.453 --> 00:05:12.422
Thank you, and good luck.

00:05:12.455 --> 00:05:13.423
Let's go get him.

00:05:13.456 --> 00:05:15.091
[Greymon] You got it.

00:05:15.125 --> 00:05:19.596
I'm your opponent now, so
give me a fight to remember!

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:21.765
(Leomon roars)

00:05:21.798 --> 00:05:24.501
(dramatic music)

00:05:30.807 --> 00:05:32.142
Hang in there!

00:05:33.643 --> 00:05:36.980
(epic orchestral music)

00:05:41.484 --> 00:05:44.654
[Garurumon] Garurumon
digivolve to...

00:06:00.704 --> 00:06:01.871
WereGarurumon!

00:06:15.385 --> 00:06:18.355
[Greymon] Greymon
digivolve to...

00:06:35.205 --> 00:06:36.239
MetalGreymon!

00:06:39.409 --> 00:06:42.245
Get on up here if you can, Matt!

00:06:52.722 --> 00:06:56.601
We're coming for you.

00:07:01.931 --> 00:07:06.069
(children talking and playing)

00:07:06.102 --> 00:07:07.103
Come on.

00:07:09.072 --> 00:07:11.574
I still can't manage
to connect with Tai.

00:07:11.608 --> 00:07:12.709
[Sora] Hey, Izzy!

00:07:12.742 --> 00:07:13.710
Uh?

00:07:13.743 --> 00:07:15.211
Sorry for being late.

00:07:15.245 --> 00:07:16.246
[Izzy] Oh, no problem.

00:07:16.279 --> 00:07:18.081
Last night, when
I got back home,

00:07:18.114 --> 00:07:20.417
my mom was there
waiting to chew me out.

00:07:21.751 --> 00:07:23.386
Ah, my legs are still numb

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:25.922
from sitting on my
knees for so long.

00:07:25.955 --> 00:07:27.724
Well, it's understandable
she's upset

00:07:27.757 --> 00:07:30.226
since we were gone for
three days during a crisis.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.762
So, what did your parents
say when you got home?

00:07:32.796 --> 00:07:33.797
Huh?

00:07:35.465 --> 00:07:38.401
Actually... my
parents are kind of...

00:07:38.435 --> 00:07:40.570
(text message ring)

00:07:40.603 --> 00:07:42.939
Oh, I just got a message
from Mimi and Joe.

00:07:42.972 --> 00:07:44.941
Seems like they're
both running late.

00:07:44.974 --> 00:07:46.776
(Izzy sighs uneasily)

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:49.112
[Tentomon] Izzy!

00:07:49.145 --> 00:07:50.613
[Izzy] Tentomon?

00:07:50.647 --> 00:07:53.116
[Tentomon] I can't believe
I finally got ahold of you!

00:07:53.149 --> 00:07:54.751
Is that really him?

00:07:54.784 --> 00:07:56.252
[Tentomon] Sora's with you to?

00:07:56.286 --> 00:07:57.420
That must mean...

00:07:57.454 --> 00:07:58.922
Ah...

00:07:58.955 --> 00:08:00.323
Shoot, I've got to
move somewhere

00:08:00.356 --> 00:08:01.624
where we can talk freely.

00:08:03.159 --> 00:08:04.127
(Izzy pants)

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.429
Hold on a second Izzy, wait up!

00:08:06.463 --> 00:08:08.431
Sorry about that, Tentomon.

00:08:08.465 --> 00:08:09.966
[Tentomon] No worries, Izzy.

00:08:09.999 --> 00:08:13.603
So, anyway, where exactly
are you two right now?

00:08:13.636 --> 00:08:16.272
Somehow or another we
ended up back in our world.

00:08:16.306 --> 00:08:17.607
[Tentomon] What?

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:19.109
But how?

00:08:19.142 --> 00:08:21.778
We're not quire sure how it
happened either, honestly.

00:08:21.811 --> 00:08:24.147
Thankfully, we're all
safe over here though.

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:25.615
[Tentomon] Oh, that's a relief.

00:08:25.648 --> 00:08:27.984
Everyone on our
side is okay too.

00:08:28.017 --> 00:08:29.285
Sora!

00:08:29.319 --> 00:08:30.620
Biyomon!

00:08:30.653 --> 00:08:31.988
Hey, where's Joe?

00:08:32.021 --> 00:08:33.957
Why isn't Mimi with you?

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:36.126
Sorry guys, but they're
running a little late.

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:38.795
[Palmon] That
sounds about right.

00:08:38.828 --> 00:08:41.464
You heard her, she said
they'll be here soon.

00:08:41.498 --> 00:08:42.966
So, what about you?

00:08:42.999 --> 00:08:45.802
Where are you guys on the
Network side right now?

00:08:45.835 --> 00:08:46.970
It kind of looks like

00:08:47.003 --> 00:08:49.305
the first place where
we fought, Tentomon.

00:08:49.339 --> 00:08:50.974
[Tentomon] Spot on
as always, Izzy.

00:08:51.007 --> 00:08:52.976
We somehow wound up back
here after we got split up

00:08:53.009 --> 00:08:55.178
from all of you earlier.

00:08:57.347 --> 00:09:00.016
Yeah, the connection's
a little iffy.

00:09:00.049 --> 00:09:01.484
[Gomamon] We had
a really hard time

00:09:01.518 --> 00:09:02.986
just getting ahold of you.

00:09:03.019 --> 00:09:04.354
(Izzy and Sora sigh uneasily)

00:09:04.387 --> 00:09:06.523
We managed to save Tokyo,

00:09:06.556 --> 00:09:09.659
but now there are problems
occurring across Networks

00:09:09.692 --> 00:09:10.860
all over the world.

00:09:12.862 --> 00:09:14.664
[Tentomon] Just
leave it to me, Izzy!

00:09:14.697 --> 00:09:15.865
I'll look into it.

00:09:15.899 --> 00:09:18.067
[Izzy] Good idea, let
me know what you find.

00:09:22.038 --> 00:09:24.374
Try to keep up with
him, MetalGreymon.

00:09:25.542 --> 00:09:26.543
Right.

00:09:32.215 --> 00:09:34.751
(air whooshes)

00:09:36.052 --> 00:09:37.687
How are we supposed
to get close to him

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.155
when we can't even catch up?

00:09:40.723 --> 00:09:43.393
MetalGreymon, I have an idea!

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:51.901
[MetalGreymon] Giga Blaster!

00:09:52.735 --> 00:09:56.739
(singing in Japanese)

00:10:09.752 --> 00:10:11.221
(WereGarurumon runs loudly)

00:10:11.254 --> 00:10:13.723
(WereGarurumon roars)

00:10:13.756 --> 00:10:14.757
Wolf Claw!

00:10:17.794 --> 00:10:20.129
(explosion)

00:10:23.299 --> 00:10:24.300
Now!

00:10:29.105 --> 00:10:30.106
[MetalGreymon] Here goes!

00:10:30.139 --> 00:10:31.107
Get ready.

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:32.909
Watch out for my signal.

00:10:32.942 --> 00:10:34.077
Mm-hmm.

00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:39.115
Trident Arm!

00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:41.618
Now, Matt!

00:10:41.651 --> 00:10:42.652
Go for it!

00:10:46.155 --> 00:10:49.626
(Matt yells determinedly)

00:10:51.628 --> 00:10:52.629
Yes!

00:10:55.465 --> 00:10:56.499
I'm coming.

00:10:58.167 --> 00:10:59.168
Ah!

00:11:02.338 --> 00:11:04.140
(Matt groans with effort)

00:11:04.173 --> 00:11:05.174
Careful!

00:11:13.016 --> 00:11:14.951
This won't last for long.

00:11:14.984 --> 00:11:18.121
[Tai] He can do it.

00:11:18.154 --> 00:11:20.790
We're running out of time!

00:11:20.823 --> 00:11:21.824
No!

00:11:23.826 --> 00:11:24.961
I can do it.

00:11:24.994 --> 00:11:26.629
I have to do it!

00:11:26.663 --> 00:11:27.997
It's me, TK!

00:11:28.031 --> 00:11:29.966
Can you hear me?

00:11:29.999 --> 00:11:31.000
TK!

00:11:31.868 --> 00:11:32.869
TK!

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:38.041
Uh...

00:11:41.344 --> 00:11:44.380
(underwater bubbling)

00:11:50.186 --> 00:11:51.888
You got to wake up!

00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:55.191
TK!

00:12:01.364 --> 00:12:04.367
(feathers explode)

00:12:07.036 --> 00:12:08.037
TK...

00:12:10.373 --> 00:12:11.374
I'm here!

00:12:12.375 --> 00:12:13.376
Wake up!

00:12:16.546 --> 00:12:18.581
[TK] Matt, is that you?

00:12:19.882 --> 00:12:23.219
(Matt groans with effort)

00:12:23.252 --> 00:12:24.387
Grab onto my hand!

00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:26.522
[TK] It is you.

00:12:26.556 --> 00:12:29.892
(TK groans with effort)

00:12:32.729 --> 00:12:36.065
(emotional piano music)

00:12:43.439 --> 00:12:47.410
You're almost there!

00:12:47.443 --> 00:12:49.579
I can't reach it.

00:12:49.612 --> 00:12:52.749
(feathers exploding)

00:13:01.124 --> 00:13:02.125
Hurry, TK!

00:13:03.126 --> 00:13:04.761
I'm trying, Matt!

00:13:08.097 --> 00:13:11.267
(hands clap)

00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:12.301
Ah!

00:13:25.982 --> 00:13:26.983
Ah!

00:13:29.952 --> 00:13:32.955
(TK and Matt grunt)

00:13:34.157 --> 00:13:35.458
You came for me.

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:38.961
Of course.

00:13:41.631 --> 00:13:44.600
Nice work, but we
have to get moving.

00:13:44.634 --> 00:13:46.135
Now for our great escape.

00:13:46.169 --> 00:13:47.170
[MetalGreymon] About time.

00:13:50.973 --> 00:13:54.277
(Trident Arm clangs)

00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:56.312
All right, let's
get out of here!

00:13:57.346 --> 00:13:59.282
We can stall Valgemon.

00:13:59.315 --> 00:14:02.618
MetalGreymon, hit him
with that attack of yours!

00:14:02.652 --> 00:14:03.653
Got it.

00:14:07.356 --> 00:14:08.491
Giga Blaster!

00:14:13.996 --> 00:14:14.997
Giga Storm!

00:14:17.333 --> 00:14:18.334
Wolf Claw!

00:14:32.181 --> 00:14:34.150
(MetalGreymon roars)

00:14:34.183 --> 00:14:36.185
(WereGarurumon groans in effort)

00:14:36.219 --> 00:14:39.021
(dramatic music)

00:14:40.690 --> 00:14:41.657
(laser blasts)

00:14:41.691 --> 00:14:42.692
Ah!

00:14:44.393 --> 00:14:45.495
Ah!

00:14:45.528 --> 00:14:47.029
(Tai screams)

00:14:47.063 --> 00:14:50.032
(Matt and TK gasp)

00:14:52.702 --> 00:14:53.703
Hang on!

00:15:04.881 --> 00:15:07.049
(loud crash)

00:15:07.083 --> 00:15:09.051
Hey, is everyone
okay over there?

00:15:10.052 --> 00:15:11.554
Sort of.

00:15:11.587 --> 00:15:12.588
-Huh?
-Huh?

00:15:15.091 --> 00:15:18.928
(MetalGreymon grunts in pain)

00:15:20.229 --> 00:15:22.365
Hold on, is that...

00:15:22.398 --> 00:15:25.768
The same attack that was able
to crush Bulbmon earlier.

00:15:33.276 --> 00:15:34.410
(TK screams)

00:15:34.443 --> 00:15:35.444
TK!

00:15:36.245 --> 00:15:37.580
Help me, Matt!

00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:45.755
TK, no!

00:15:47.957 --> 00:15:49.392
This is bad, you guys.

00:15:49.425 --> 00:15:51.093
We have to get out of here!

00:15:53.596 --> 00:15:55.598
Please, help me!

00:15:55.631 --> 00:15:57.934
(underwater bubbling)

00:15:57.967 --> 00:15:59.644
(man groans with effort)

00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:04.548
Don't leave me, Matt.

00:16:08.019 --> 00:16:10.354
(sad music)

00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:13.691
Careful!

00:16:20.197 --> 00:16:23.567
(man groans with effort)

00:16:30.074 --> 00:16:31.742
Stop it right now!

00:16:34.578 --> 00:16:37.248
(hopeful music)

00:16:52.096 --> 00:16:54.398
(TK gasps)

00:17:14.585 --> 00:17:16.921
(explosion)

00:17:18.756 --> 00:17:19.757
Huh?

00:17:22.293 --> 00:17:27.298
What is all this light?

00:17:28.099 --> 00:17:30.601
(hopeful music swells)

00:17:46.117 --> 00:17:48.119
No way... Could it be?

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:50.788
There's no doubt about it.

00:17:50.821 --> 00:17:53.758
That Digimon is the one
that we've been looking for

00:17:53.791 --> 00:17:55.793
this whole time.

00:17:55.826 --> 00:17:57.661
The Celestial Digimon!

00:18:00.965 --> 00:18:01.966
TK...

00:18:25.189 --> 00:18:26.657
I see...

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:27.691
TK is...

00:18:42.206 --> 00:18:43.474
That light...

00:18:43.507 --> 00:18:45.509
They must have found it.

00:18:55.352 --> 00:18:59.657
(hopeful music crescendos)

00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:00.691
TK.

00:19:06.564 --> 00:19:08.065
This light is...

00:19:09.033 --> 00:19:10.534
Giving us power.

00:19:11.368 --> 00:19:12.536
I can feel it.

00:19:19.043 --> 00:19:20.511
(laser blasts)

00:19:20.544 --> 00:19:23.547
(WereGarurumon roars)

00:19:23.581 --> 00:19:24.715
Giga Storm!

00:19:28.219 --> 00:19:30.721
(fire blasts)

00:19:32.256 --> 00:19:33.257
Wolf Claw!

00:19:38.095 --> 00:19:40.431
(explosion)

00:19:42.066 --> 00:19:46.437
No way, the Celestial
Digimon's power's incredible.

00:19:59.917 --> 00:20:02.786
(Angemon chuckles)

00:20:04.455 --> 00:20:05.456
Huh?

00:20:06.423 --> 00:20:09.426
(Matt and Tai gasp)

00:20:27.778 --> 00:20:30.247
Did the Celestial
Digimon just...

00:20:30.281 --> 00:20:31.949
Become an egg?

00:20:31.982 --> 00:20:33.784
Or am I crazy?

00:20:37.655 --> 00:20:39.456
That's got to be a digi-egg.

00:20:40.958 --> 00:20:44.128
All Digimon, no matter how weak
or strong they end up being,

00:20:44.161 --> 00:20:45.763
are born from them.

00:20:45.796 --> 00:20:48.766
And when our lives here
eventually come to an end,

00:20:48.799 --> 00:20:51.001
we're reborn once
again as a digi-egg.

00:21:07.184 --> 00:21:08.152
(TK gasps)

00:21:08.185 --> 00:21:11.188
(Matt and Tai gasp)

00:21:14.491 --> 00:21:15.492
Who is that guy,

00:21:15.526 --> 00:21:17.228
and what's he want with the egg?

00:21:19.163 --> 00:21:22.199
(TK gasps worriedly)

00:21:23.667 --> 00:21:25.135
[Devimon] I see,

00:21:25.169 --> 00:21:27.972
So you've unintentionally
ended up in the suited form

00:21:28.005 --> 00:21:29.506
to steep into darkness.

00:21:31.342 --> 00:21:32.643
Now then,

00:21:32.676 --> 00:21:34.511
return to my side.

00:21:35.512 --> 00:21:37.681
Oh great Celestial Digimon.

00:21:40.517 --> 00:21:41.485

[Izzy] Next up on the
Digimon Encyclopedia is...

00:22:43.614 --> 00:22:45.049
Kabuterimon!

00:22:45.082 --> 00:22:48.085
This Digimon evolves
from my partner Tentomon.

00:22:48.118 --> 00:22:50.754
The Electro Shocker attack
can take out multiple enemies

00:22:50.788 --> 00:22:51.922
in one strike.

00:22:52.790 --> 00:22:54.458
And check out this fun fact...

00:22:54.491 --> 00:22:55.926
It may not look like it,

00:22:55.959 --> 00:22:57.561
but Kabuterimon's
head is actually

00:22:57.594 --> 00:22:59.563
pretty comfortable to ride on.

00:22:59.596 --> 00:23:02.399
I've learned some jokes
while riding up there too.

00:23:02.433 --> 00:23:04.635
I don't understand half
of them to be honest.

00:23:07.438 --> 00:23:09.273
Which Digimon will
it be next time?

00:23:11.141 --> 00:23:13.077
[Narrator] When Tai puts
himself in harms way

00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:14.578
to protect a friend,

00:23:14.611 --> 00:23:17.948
a never-before-seen miracle
befalls MetalGreymon.

00:23:17.981 --> 00:23:19.783
[Tai] Next time on
Digimon Adventure:

00:23:19.817 --> 00:23:21.452
"The Tide-Turning Update."

00:23:21.485 --> 00:23:24.121
The adventure continues
in a new world.
