The final battle
to decide the fate

00:01:42.345 --> 00:01:45.682
of the Digital world
has been fought and won.

00:01:45.715 --> 00:01:48.351
With Millenniumon
finally destroyed,

00:01:48.385 --> 00:01:51.354
the Digi-destined and
their Digimon partners

00:01:51.388 --> 00:01:53.957
take a well deserved break.

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.359
[Agumon] We did
it, Tai, we did it.

00:01:56.393 --> 00:02:00.163
[Tai] Yeah, our mission
is officially over.

00:02:04.334 --> 00:02:06.303
(gadget beeps)

00:02:06.336 --> 00:02:07.370
Seriously?

00:02:07.404 --> 00:02:10.206
I was just starting to relax.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.375
Salutations, Izzy.

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:13.910
Huh, Garbagemon!

00:02:14.744 --> 00:02:17.714
Ooh, it worked, I got through.

00:02:17.747 --> 00:02:19.215
Garbagemon?

00:02:19.249 --> 00:02:21.885
Oh the one Tai was
telling us about.

00:02:21.918 --> 00:02:25.689
Yeah, the one we met on
a mountain of garbage.

00:02:25.722 --> 00:02:28.058
Well, well, I haven't
seen clear skies

00:02:28.091 --> 00:02:30.327
like this in a long, long time.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.661
What did you need?

00:02:31.695 --> 00:02:34.164
We were in such a good
mood till you called.

00:02:34.197 --> 00:02:35.565
Nice to see you too.

00:02:35.598 --> 00:02:40.170
So anyway, Izzy, you recognize
this symbol, don't you?

00:02:40.203 --> 00:02:41.204
Uh, Yeah?

00:02:42.372 --> 00:02:46.042
(dramatic suspenseful music)

00:02:46.076 --> 00:02:48.144
Where are you right now, anyway?

00:02:48.178 --> 00:02:49.579
[Garbagemon] Well
this may surprise you,

00:02:49.612 --> 00:02:51.715
but after we left that
mountain of treasure,

00:02:51.748 --> 00:02:54.184
we went on a journey
of exploration

00:02:54.217 --> 00:02:58.621
and eventually we came across
the most amazing place.

00:03:00.724 --> 00:03:02.359
(Tai gasps)

00:03:02.392 --> 00:03:05.128
(monitors chime)

00:03:08.732 --> 00:03:10.934
It's a place where
all kinds information

00:03:10.967 --> 00:03:14.637
from all over the Digital
world is gathered.

00:03:19.642 --> 00:03:21.077
Huh?

00:03:21.111 --> 00:03:22.278
[Garbagemon] Hello?

00:03:22.312 --> 00:03:24.080
Okay if we come down?

00:03:25.315 --> 00:03:26.316
Oh, wow.

00:03:30.153 --> 00:03:32.822
(Agumon grunts)

00:03:35.258 --> 00:03:37.994
(monitors chime)

00:03:42.165 --> 00:03:43.767
[Garbagemon] Izzy!

00:03:47.771 --> 00:03:50.340
[Izzy] Searchmon, Garbagemon!

00:03:52.275 --> 00:03:55.578
I'd like you to meet a
great seeker of knowledge,

00:03:55.612 --> 00:03:56.946
this is Wisemon.

00:03:57.814 --> 00:04:00.083
Greetings, Digi-destined,

00:04:00.116 --> 00:04:02.585
it is a pleasure to meet you.

00:04:02.619 --> 00:04:07.090
This encounter brings great
joy to my banks of knowledge.

00:04:07.123 --> 00:04:09.459
What is the Digital world?

00:04:09.492 --> 00:04:11.428
What are Digimon?

00:04:11.461 --> 00:04:13.263
Where do we come from?

00:04:13.296 --> 00:04:14.964
And where do we go?

00:04:14.998 --> 00:04:16.666
To try and answer
these questions,

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:19.269
we are constantly
gathering data.

00:04:19.302 --> 00:04:21.938
This brings joy to my knowledge.

00:04:21.971 --> 00:04:24.007
That's a whole lot of joy.

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.444
It sounds to me like you're
somebody who likes to study lot.

00:04:27.477 --> 00:04:30.613
Hey, Joe, I think you
two are gonna get along.

00:04:30.647 --> 00:04:31.815
Yeah, maybe.

00:04:34.384 --> 00:04:35.852
[Garbagemon] Hop on, everyone,

00:04:35.885 --> 00:04:37.654
I'll show you around.

00:04:48.231 --> 00:04:49.466
Look at this!

00:04:49.499 --> 00:04:51.868
It's like one big laboratory

00:04:51.901 --> 00:04:53.369
[Garbagemon] Digimon
with high intellects,

00:04:53.403 --> 00:04:56.039
questioning minds,
and lots of curiosity,

00:04:56.072 --> 00:04:58.041
come from all over
the Digital world

00:04:58.074 --> 00:05:00.710
and gather together here
to share information

00:05:00.743 --> 00:05:02.879
and debate different theories.

00:05:02.912 --> 00:05:05.482
Sometimes, we carry
out field studies,

00:05:05.515 --> 00:05:07.517
looking for answers
because trying

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.720
to find the answers is what
this facility is all about.

00:05:10.753 --> 00:05:11.988
Since I've been here,

00:05:12.021 --> 00:05:14.691
new discoveries are
being made all the time.

00:05:14.724 --> 00:05:18.561
And it brings joy to my
knowledge too. (laughs)

00:05:18.595 --> 00:05:21.064
The joy seems to be spreading.

00:05:21.097 --> 00:05:23.600
(Izzy laughs)

00:05:25.034 --> 00:05:26.169
[Sora] What's all that?

00:05:26.202 --> 00:05:27.403
[Garbagemon] Oh, that's garbage,

00:05:27.437 --> 00:05:30.573
I mean that's where we
store all the damaged,

00:05:30.607 --> 00:05:33.743
corrupted or otherwise
unsortable data.

00:05:33.776 --> 00:05:37.413
[Izzy] Wow, This place is
like the inside of a computer.

00:05:37.447 --> 00:05:40.250
[Wisemon] This enormous
tree was itself discovered

00:05:40.283 --> 00:05:44.087
by researchers many
generations before our time.

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:48.258
It has become the repository
of many historical artifacts.

00:05:48.291 --> 00:05:50.727
We use this place as
a base of operations

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.763
for conducting all
of our research.

00:05:53.796 --> 00:05:56.232
(Izzy gasps)

00:06:03.473 --> 00:06:05.909
(feet clank)

00:06:07.243 --> 00:06:08.878
(Agumon gasps)

00:06:08.912 --> 00:06:11.247
(Tai gasps)

00:06:13.483 --> 00:06:15.718
[Tai] Wait, those symbols.

00:06:15.752 --> 00:06:18.588
[Gomamon] Yeah,
they look familiar.

00:06:18.621 --> 00:06:20.623
Where have we seen those before?

00:06:20.657 --> 00:06:24.060
[Sora] They're the same ones
that are on our Digivices.

00:06:24.093 --> 00:06:26.462
But what do they mean?

00:06:26.496 --> 00:06:28.631
[Wisemon] When did
these shapes originate?

00:06:28.665 --> 00:06:31.634
No matter how much of
their history we unravel,

00:06:31.668 --> 00:06:34.938
we cannot discover
the answer to that.

00:06:34.971 --> 00:06:38.308
Long ago, so far into the past

00:06:38.341 --> 00:06:41.244
that words cannot describe it.

00:06:41.277 --> 00:06:44.747
We assume they've existed since
the beginning of the world.

00:06:44.781 --> 00:06:48.117
There is no other
logical conclusion.

00:06:48.151 --> 00:06:51.254
They are the greatest
mystery of all to us.

00:06:51.287 --> 00:06:54.457
The crests, that is
what we call them.

00:06:55.525 --> 00:06:57.160
The crests?

00:06:57.193 --> 00:06:59.329
[Wisemon] It is said
they are a hidden code

00:06:59.362 --> 00:07:02.165
to the structure
of all the world.

00:07:02.198 --> 00:07:04.968
Messages sent here
from somewhere else.

00:07:05.001 --> 00:07:07.437
The records of all things.

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:09.639
The answers to all things.

00:07:12.041 --> 00:07:14.344
Our predecessors
probed the mysteries

00:07:14.377 --> 00:07:16.479
and produced many theories.

00:07:16.512 --> 00:07:19.349
But they never succeeded
in reaching the truth.

00:07:19.382 --> 00:07:21.618
However, one thing is clear.

00:07:21.651 --> 00:07:23.519
These crests will
play a vital role

00:07:23.553 --> 00:07:28.291
in navigating those anomalies
currently plaguing the world.

00:07:28.324 --> 00:07:30.693
We do not know why this is so,

00:07:30.727 --> 00:07:34.464
but something within
us is telling us this.

00:07:34.497 --> 00:07:37.200
There is no other
way to explain it.

00:07:37.233 --> 00:07:40.203
Yeah, in fact, I've kind
of wondered about them.

00:07:40.236 --> 00:07:42.538
I thought they might
be some sort of icon,

00:07:42.572 --> 00:07:46.175
possibly put there to identify
the owner of each Digivice.

00:07:46.209 --> 00:07:47.877
Sounds like there's
a whole lot more

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:50.213
to these crest than just that.

00:07:50.246 --> 00:07:51.681
-(Digivice chimes)
-(Matt gasps)

00:07:51.714 --> 00:07:54.817
(crests chime)

00:07:54.851 --> 00:07:56.486
(Tai and Agumon gasps)

00:07:56.519 --> 00:07:57.987
Can it possibly be?

00:07:58.021 --> 00:08:00.156
-Huh, what's going on?
-The crests and the data

00:08:00.189 --> 00:08:04.560
of the Digi-destined are
matching and resonating.

00:08:04.594 --> 00:08:07.397
(Digivice chimes)

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:08.831
What the heck?

00:08:08.865 --> 00:08:11.701
It appears crests
are reading them,

00:08:11.734 --> 00:08:15.571
analyzing the data of
their adventures thus far.

00:08:15.605 --> 00:08:16.739
Adventures?

00:08:18.041 --> 00:08:22.545
-Analyzing our experiences?
-(gentle music)

00:08:27.383 --> 00:08:28.384
Huh?

00:08:29.052 --> 00:08:31.454
(Matt gasps)

00:08:33.389 --> 00:08:35.692
(wings flapping)

00:08:35.725 --> 00:08:37.093
Amazing.

00:08:37.126 --> 00:08:38.761
(Palmon grunts)

00:08:38.795 --> 00:08:40.096
What is it?

00:08:40.129 --> 00:08:43.199
You and the crest share
a deep connection.

00:08:43.232 --> 00:08:46.269
There is no question about it.

00:08:46.302 --> 00:08:48.538
So let me state this clearly,

00:08:48.571 --> 00:08:51.240
you children are the
entities who hold the fate

00:08:51.274 --> 00:08:53.376
of all in your hands.

00:08:53.409 --> 00:08:55.578
The fate of those who
summoned you here,

00:08:55.611 --> 00:08:57.947
we Digimon, as well as the fate

00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:00.950
of the whole Digital
world itself.

00:09:00.983 --> 00:09:04.587
This truly brings great
joy to my knowledge.

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:05.588
Oh, okay, cool.

00:09:05.621 --> 00:09:07.290
No pressure.

00:09:07.323 --> 00:09:09.392
So we've been amazing
all this time,

00:09:09.425 --> 00:09:11.127
we just didn't know it!

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:12.628
Guess so.

00:09:12.662 --> 00:09:15.898
At least that new darkness
thing is behind us now anyway.

00:09:15.932 --> 00:09:17.233
No.

00:09:17.266 --> 00:09:18.401
Huh?

00:09:18.434 --> 00:09:20.403
It has not ended.

00:09:20.436 --> 00:09:23.139
You children are the
only ones who can defeat

00:09:23.172 --> 00:09:25.808
the Great Catastrophe
that is to come.

00:09:25.842 --> 00:09:27.810
The what that is to come?

00:09:27.844 --> 00:09:30.580
-the Great Catastrophe.
-(ominous music)

00:09:30.613 --> 00:09:33.416
Wait a sec, wasn't
that Millenniumon?

00:09:33.449 --> 00:09:37.920
Millenniumon, also known as
the uncontrollable darkness,

00:09:37.954 --> 00:09:41.290
-was only a stepping stone.
-Uh-huh.

00:09:41.324 --> 00:09:43.760
As I'm sure you're all aware,

00:09:43.793 --> 00:09:46.329
a large amount of
energy has been siphoned

00:09:46.362 --> 00:09:49.332
from the human world
by some outside entity.

00:09:49.365 --> 00:09:53.269
Now, even Millenniumon
gone, it hasn't stopped.

00:09:53.302 --> 00:09:55.338
It's still going
on, like before.

00:09:55.371 --> 00:09:58.674
Yes, the danger
is far from over.

00:09:58.708 --> 00:09:59.976
We have not been able

00:10:00.009 --> 00:10:02.779
to trace the energy's
ultimate destination,

00:10:02.812 --> 00:10:06.149
but it's clear that
this entity or its will,

00:10:06.182 --> 00:10:08.184
must still be alive.

00:10:08.217 --> 00:10:10.953
Something even darker
than Millenniumon is

00:10:10.987 --> 00:10:12.355
about to make a move.

00:10:12.388 --> 00:10:14.357
You're saying our
work's not done yet,

00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:16.025
is that right?

00:10:16.058 --> 00:10:18.694
What happens in the
Great Catastrophe?

00:10:18.728 --> 00:10:20.563
All we know is this.

00:10:22.165 --> 00:10:23.800
Uh, it's blank.

00:10:23.833 --> 00:10:25.001
Is it broken?

00:10:25.034 --> 00:10:27.970
[Wisemon] No, it is the answer.

00:10:28.004 --> 00:10:30.006
Huh, What does that mean?

00:10:30.039 --> 00:10:33.876
All we know is that
we do not know.

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:36.546
This too brings great
joy to my knowledge.

00:10:36.579 --> 00:10:37.547
What the heck?

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:39.315
That's not even funny.

00:10:39.348 --> 00:10:42.218
Yeah, how does
that bring you joy.

00:10:42.251 --> 00:10:45.822
-(wings flapping)
-(echoing sounds)

00:10:45.855 --> 00:10:50.860
-(laser chimes)
-(explosion rumbles)

00:10:54.697 --> 00:10:57.366
(Burpmon chews)

00:11:03.039 --> 00:11:06.717
(Burpmon burps)

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:12.890
(electronic chimes)

00:11:12.924 --> 00:11:15.626
(glass shatters)

00:11:17.061 --> 00:11:19.630
(Digimon gasp)

00:11:27.471 --> 00:11:29.907
(Burpmon burps)

00:11:29.941 --> 00:11:31.409
(Tai and Matt gasp)

00:11:31.442 --> 00:11:32.910
-Wisemon
-Wisemon,

00:11:32.944 --> 00:11:35.112
we're under attack!

00:11:35.146 --> 00:11:37.748
There's a Digimon outside
eating everything.

00:11:37.782 --> 00:11:41.085
Even the data we
gathered on catastrophe,

00:11:41.118 --> 00:11:44.555
nearly all of our most
important data's been eaten.

00:11:44.589 --> 00:11:46.057
Impossible!

00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:50.094
[Bucchimon] It's not safe
here, we should evacuate, now!

00:11:50.127 --> 00:11:53.231
Who would do such a thing?

00:11:53.264 --> 00:11:54.732
Huh?

00:11:54.765 --> 00:11:57.668
(Garbagemon gasps)

00:11:58.502 --> 00:12:00.671
[Mimi] Uh, what is that?

00:12:02.106 --> 00:12:04.141
-Watch out!
-(Bucchimon grunt)

00:12:04.175 --> 00:12:05.643
(Garbagemon gasps)

00:12:05.676 --> 00:12:08.913
[Wisemon] That most gluttonous
Digimon who eats any kind

00:12:08.946 --> 00:12:09.947
of data!

00:12:10.815 --> 00:12:12.416
(Burpmon burps)

00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:14.485
-Burpmon!
-(Burpmon gasps)

00:12:14.518 --> 00:12:16.921
(crests chime)

00:12:16.954 --> 00:12:19.490
(Burpmon groans)

00:12:19.523 --> 00:12:20.858
Ready, Agumon?

00:12:22.493 --> 00:12:24.929
Agumon Digivolve to

00:12:24.962 --> 00:12:26.264
Greymon!

00:12:26.297 --> 00:12:28.165
(Burpmon grunts)

00:12:28.199 --> 00:12:31.302
(Burpmon bounces and groans)

00:12:31.335 --> 00:12:34.171
How dare you try and steal
their important data!

00:12:34.205 --> 00:12:37.275
Yeah, that's so rude
to dine and dash.

00:12:37.308 --> 00:12:39.610
(Burpmon screams)

00:12:39.644 --> 00:12:40.778
Palmon!

00:12:40.811 --> 00:12:42.480
Palmon Digivolve to

00:12:43.381 --> 00:12:44.682
Togemon!

00:12:44.715 --> 00:12:46.851
Gabumon Digivolve to

00:12:46.884 --> 00:12:48.119
Garurumon!

00:12:48.152 --> 00:12:50.688
Biyomon Digivolve to

00:12:50.721 --> 00:12:51.689
Birdramon!

00:12:51.722 --> 00:12:54.191
Tentomon Digivolve to

00:12:54.225 --> 00:12:55.526
Kabuterimon!

00:12:55.559 --> 00:12:57.828
Gomamon Digivolve to

00:12:57.862 --> 00:12:59.363
Ikkakumon!

00:12:59.397 --> 00:13:01.532
(Digivices chime)

00:13:01.565 --> 00:13:03.401
Uh, What's going on?

00:13:04.735 --> 00:13:05.836
Nova Blast!

00:13:07.238 --> 00:13:08.539
(Burpmon groans)

00:13:08.572 --> 00:13:10.508
All right, we did it.

00:13:17.748 --> 00:13:19.150
(Tai grunts)

00:13:19.183 --> 00:13:20.685
Howling Blaster!

00:13:22.019 --> 00:13:23.187
Meteor Wing!

00:13:24.355 --> 00:13:25.856
Harpoon Torpedo!

00:13:27.858 --> 00:13:29.093
Needle Spray!

00:13:30.761 --> 00:13:32.263
Electro Shocker!

00:13:37.935 --> 00:13:39.203
(Burpmon burps)

00:13:39.236 --> 00:13:42.239
That Digimon's
eating our attacks?

00:13:43.574 --> 00:13:44.675
(Burpmon burps)

00:13:44.709 --> 00:13:46.410
Uh, did Burpmon get bigger?

00:13:46.444 --> 00:13:48.245
How dare you!

00:13:48.279 --> 00:13:51.015
All right, that does it.

00:13:51.048 --> 00:13:53.718
(Dustbin sucks)

00:13:55.052 --> 00:13:57.722
(Burpmon sucks)

00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:02.626
[Izzy] Garbagemon!

00:14:06.063 --> 00:14:08.199
(garbage can clanks)

00:14:08.232 --> 00:14:10.735
(Garbagemon groans)

00:14:10.768 --> 00:14:14.605
Hm, it seems there are some
things even Burpmon won't eat.

00:14:14.638 --> 00:14:16.107
(spirited music)

00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:19.210
(Digimon struggle)

00:14:19.243 --> 00:14:20.544
This isn't funny!

00:14:20.578 --> 00:14:23.047
Seriously, no joke!

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:25.583
We need to take
this fight outside.

00:14:25.616 --> 00:14:27.718
[Everyone] All right!

00:14:27.752 --> 00:14:30.488
(Digivices beep)

00:14:31.655 --> 00:14:33.491
Greymon digivolve to

00:14:34.458 --> 00:14:35.659
Metalgreymon!

00:14:36.827 --> 00:14:39.563
Birdramon digivolve to

00:14:39.597 --> 00:14:40.931
Garudamon!

00:14:40.965 --> 00:14:43.801
(Burpmon screams)

00:14:46.604 --> 00:14:48.439
(Digivice chimes)

00:14:48.472 --> 00:14:51.308
Kabuterimon digivolve to

00:14:51.342 --> 00:14:52.843
Megakabuterimon!

00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:59.683
(Megakabuterimon grunts)

00:15:06.791 --> 00:15:08.426
[MetalGreymon] Giga Storm!

00:15:08.459 --> 00:15:11.462
(Burpmon screams)

00:15:11.495 --> 00:15:14.331
Watch out, Burpmon's
trying to get back inside.

00:15:14.365 --> 00:15:16.801
So Burpmon's target is the data?

00:15:16.834 --> 00:15:18.969
[Garudamon] Wing Blade!

00:15:24.141 --> 00:15:25.509
(Burpmon burps)

00:15:25.543 --> 00:15:28.512
How do we fight an enemy
who eats everything?

00:15:28.546 --> 00:15:32.016
Eats everything, including data.

00:15:32.049 --> 00:15:35.019
If we could just
find enough data,

00:15:35.052 --> 00:15:36.387
a data overload.

00:15:37.822 --> 00:15:39.023
Wait, that's it.

00:15:39.056 --> 00:15:40.783
I've got it everyone!

00:15:44.195 --> 00:15:46.530
(explosions boom)

00:15:46.564 --> 00:15:49.533
(Garudamon screams)

00:15:51.268 --> 00:15:53.404
[Lillymon] Flower Cannon!

00:15:53.437 --> 00:15:54.405
Ow!

00:15:54.438 --> 00:15:56.240
(Izzy chuckles)

00:15:56.273 --> 00:15:58.609
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:15:59.443 --> 00:16:01.545
[Tai] With garbage data?

00:16:01.579 --> 00:16:04.248
(feet clanking)

00:16:09.386 --> 00:16:12.756
If you're really that
hungry, eat this.

00:16:14.425 --> 00:16:17.595
(Burpmon chews)

00:16:17.628 --> 00:16:20.297
(Zudomon yells)

00:16:24.468 --> 00:16:27.238
(Burpmon groans)

00:16:28.472 --> 00:16:29.907
I don't know if this'll work,

00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:31.909
but if we can overload
Burpmon's intake

00:16:31.942 --> 00:16:34.311
with a massive amount of data

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:39.283
(Burpmon groans)

00:16:44.088 --> 00:16:45.256
Horn Buster!

00:16:47.157 --> 00:16:49.927
(Burpmon groans)

00:16:50.761 --> 00:16:51.795
Giga Storm!

00:16:53.664 --> 00:16:56.233
(Burpmon groans)

00:16:56.267 --> 00:16:58.969
(explosion booms)

00:16:59.003 --> 00:17:00.504
Yeah, it worked!

00:17:03.674 --> 00:17:06.510
(everyone cheers)

00:17:09.313 --> 00:17:11.315
Looks like you got
all your data back.

00:17:11.348 --> 00:17:13.751
But look at how it's
scattered all over the place

00:17:13.784 --> 00:17:15.085
and all mixed up.

00:17:15.119 --> 00:17:17.588
Restoring it all is
gonna take forever.

00:17:17.621 --> 00:17:20.024
Don't worry, I'll help you.

00:17:21.191 --> 00:17:22.993
[Wisemon] All the
precious data was saved,

00:17:23.027 --> 00:17:24.662
thanks to you children.

00:17:24.695 --> 00:17:27.631
This truly brings
joy to my knowledge

00:17:28.465 --> 00:17:31.168
But there's still that Great
Catastrophe you mentioned.

00:17:31.201 --> 00:17:32.970
It's all about to
begin, isn't it?

00:17:33.003 --> 00:17:36.640
Yep, looks like we've still
got some work ahead of us.

00:17:36.674 --> 00:17:40.277
Oh great, just when I
hoped we were finally done.

00:17:40.311 --> 00:17:41.312
Yeah, right?

00:17:41.345 --> 00:17:43.614
How long's this gonna go on for?

00:17:43.647 --> 00:17:45.950
-(Tai exhales sharply)
-(gentle uplifting music)

00:17:45.983 --> 00:17:48.319
We get to continue
the adventure.

00:17:48.352 --> 00:17:50.120
I'm all for it!

00:17:50.154 --> 00:17:53.457
With Agumon at my side,
there's nothing to fear.

00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:54.491
Mm-hm.

00:17:55.526 --> 00:17:58.295
And I don't do it
because I was chosen

00:17:58.329 --> 00:18:00.030
or cause it's my mission.

00:18:00.064 --> 00:18:02.466
I do it for my friends.

00:18:02.499 --> 00:18:05.336
And all the Digimon
are my friends!

00:18:05.369 --> 00:18:07.871
Not so bad yourself.

00:18:07.905 --> 00:18:10.307
(Kari chuckles)

00:18:10.341 --> 00:18:11.742
[Everyone] Hmm.

00:18:16.513 --> 00:18:19.817
(crests chime)

00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:22.052
-(Digivice chimes)
-(Tai gasps)

00:18:22.086 --> 00:18:23.721
What's happening?

00:18:23.754 --> 00:18:25.656
What is it now?

00:18:25.689 --> 00:18:27.324
A new phenomenon.

00:18:27.358 --> 00:18:30.527
Oh, another joy added
to my knowledge.

00:18:31.895 --> 00:18:33.364
Weird.

00:18:33.397 --> 00:18:36.166
Looks like the arrows are
pointing all over the place.

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:38.168
Every one of 'em is different.

00:18:38.202 --> 00:18:39.903
What do you think it could mean?

00:18:39.937 --> 00:18:42.172
As I was explaining earlier,

00:18:42.206 --> 00:18:44.575
we believe that the
crests hold the key

00:18:44.608 --> 00:18:47.511
to avoiding the
Great Catastrophe.

00:18:47.544 --> 00:18:51.849
But unfortunately we do not
know anything more than that.

00:18:51.882 --> 00:18:54.051
So do you think
we'll find the answer

00:18:54.084 --> 00:18:56.687
if we just go to where
these arrows are pointing?

00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:58.255
I believe so.

00:18:58.288 --> 00:18:59.356
Let's go then.

00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:00.357
What do you say?

00:19:00.391 --> 00:19:01.392
Okay.

00:19:08.298 --> 00:19:10.367
[Agumon] Wait, Tai, look!

00:19:10.401 --> 00:19:11.602
[Tai] Huh?

00:19:11.635 --> 00:19:14.004
Hey, why is mine the
only one doing that?

00:19:14.038 --> 00:19:15.005
(everyone gasps)

00:19:15.039 --> 00:19:16.707
Well, I guess we're
just gonna have

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:18.709
to find out when we
get there, right?

00:19:18.742 --> 00:19:19.710
Guess so.

00:19:19.743 --> 00:19:21.612
I'm sure there is a reason each

00:19:21.645 --> 00:19:23.714
of those places
is calling to you.

00:19:23.747 --> 00:19:27.217
Go then, please, and
find the answers for us.

00:19:27.251 --> 00:19:29.019
You know, before I head on out,

00:19:29.053 --> 00:19:30.454
I think I'm gonna stay here

00:19:30.487 --> 00:19:33.090
for a little bit and
research something.

00:19:33.123 --> 00:19:36.226
I can help them with restoring
all the data while I'm at it.

00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:38.462
Okay, sounds good to me.

00:19:38.495 --> 00:19:39.897
(Gatomon groans)

00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:41.231
Gatomon!

00:19:41.265 --> 00:19:42.633
I'm alright.

00:19:42.666 --> 00:19:46.637
But you weren't able to
evolve earlier so I'm worried

00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:47.938
about you.

00:19:47.971 --> 00:19:49.640
Maybe you're just tired.

00:19:49.673 --> 00:19:52.609
You did go through
an extreme Digivolve.

00:19:52.643 --> 00:19:55.245
Why don't we just rest
here for a little while?

00:19:55.279 --> 00:19:56.647
Gatomon.

00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:58.949
No, really, it's nothing.

00:20:00.284 --> 00:20:01.919
It's fatigue.

00:20:01.952 --> 00:20:04.655
Relaxing's the best
remedy for that.

00:20:04.688 --> 00:20:06.156
Relaxing, yeah.

00:20:10.661 --> 00:20:13.130
-Oh the hot springs!
-Oh the hot springs!

00:20:13.163 --> 00:20:15.165
-Hm, hot springs?
-Hm, hot springs?

00:20:15.199 --> 00:20:16.667
We can take you there.

00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:19.269
It's a place Joe and I
are pretty familiar with.

00:20:19.303 --> 00:20:20.270
-Hm.
-Hm.

00:20:20.304 --> 00:20:21.638
Wanna go?

00:20:21.672 --> 00:20:22.639
Yeah.

00:20:22.673 --> 00:20:24.108
Are you sure, Kari?

00:20:24.141 --> 00:20:26.443
It's all about you and Patamon,

00:20:26.477 --> 00:20:28.612
we want you both to get better.

00:20:28.645 --> 00:20:31.148
Oh, if you say so,

00:20:31.715 --> 00:20:35.853
then Leader Joe, Gomamon,
please show us the way.

00:20:35.886 --> 00:20:37.121
-Okay,
-(gentle uplifting music)

00:20:37.154 --> 00:20:40.224
everyone who's coming,
let's hit the road.

00:20:58.075 --> 00:20:59.710
(Izzy sighs)

00:20:59.743 --> 00:21:01.311
What's the matter, Izzy?

00:21:01.345 --> 00:21:03.213
Is something bothering you?

00:21:03.247 --> 00:21:04.648
I was just wondering,

00:21:04.681 --> 00:21:07.985
did Burpmon really come
just for the data or?

00:21:08.018 --> 00:21:09.186
Or?

00:21:09.219 --> 00:21:10.554
Well, that attack happened just

00:21:10.587 --> 00:21:12.723
after we'd found
out about the crest.

00:21:12.756 --> 00:21:14.892
Do you think that it
might have been connected

00:21:14.925 --> 00:21:17.394
to the Great Catastrophe?

00:21:17.427 --> 00:21:20.731
One mystery leads
to more mysteries.

00:21:20.764 --> 00:21:21.899
This too

00:21:21.932 --> 00:21:24.067
[Everyone] Brings great
joy to my knowledge!

00:21:24.101 --> 00:21:25.335
It really does!

00:21:25.369 --> 00:21:27.404
(everyone laughs)

00:21:27.437 --> 00:21:29.673
I can't wait, Tai,
I'm so pumped!

00:21:29.706 --> 00:21:32.843
Me too, cause I know
somewhere out there,

00:21:32.876 --> 00:21:35.279
we'll find the answer, Agumon.

The Digimon encyclopedia,

00:22:43.447 --> 00:22:45.115
Magnadramon.

00:22:45.148 --> 00:22:48.318
This Digimon Mega-Digivolves
from from Angewomon.

00:22:48.352 --> 00:22:52.422
They say Magnadramon is the
one who annihilates all evil.

00:22:52.456 --> 00:22:54.424
Now let's check this out,

00:22:54.458 --> 00:22:57.961
the legendary Magnadramon only
appears when fighting evil.

00:22:57.995 --> 00:22:59.930
Does that mean
Magnadramon would appear

00:22:59.963 --> 00:23:01.598
if I did something bad?

00:23:01.632 --> 00:23:04.334
Like, if I painted stripes
on tentomon's wings?

00:23:04.368 --> 00:23:07.170
(Digital beeping)

00:23:07.204 --> 00:23:09.306
Which Digimon will
it be next time?

00:23:10.974 --> 00:23:14.978
Sora and Garudamon are
swallowed by boiling lava,

00:23:15.012 --> 00:23:18.815
but that's just when the wings
of miracles begin to flutter.

00:23:18.849 --> 00:23:22.019
Next time, dance of
the heavens, Phoenixmon

00:23:22.052 --> 00:23:24.655
The adventure continues
in a new world.
