[Narrator] This is
the mysterious world

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:44.191
where Digimon live,

00:01:44.224 --> 00:01:45.926
the Digital World.

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:48.595
Tai Kamiya and the rest
of the Digi-Destined

00:01:48.629 --> 00:01:52.032
journey onward to a new
stage in their adventure.

00:01:52.065 --> 00:01:54.268
Though the crew is
scattered to the winds,

00:01:54.301 --> 00:01:57.271
they're doing their best
to reunite once more.

00:01:57.304 --> 00:02:00.607
But while T.K. and Patamon
sprint through a savage land

00:02:00.641 --> 00:02:02.876
where only the strong survive,

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:06.413
it seems that danger looms
closer and closer behind.

Stay with me, buddy.

You hear me?

00:03:05.038 --> 00:03:06.273
Please wake up.

Hey T.K., you all right?

00:03:24.491 --> 00:03:25.859
Is that you, Tai?

00:03:25.893 --> 00:03:27.127
Fancy seeing you here.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.129
Oh, wow, Sora!

Get 'em, Birdramon!

Meteor wing!

(meteors crashing)

00:03:41.174 --> 00:03:43.644
Fangmon, a Champion Digimon.

(Birdramon grunts)

00:03:51.418 --> 00:03:52.553
Now, Greymon!

00:03:52.586 --> 00:03:54.721
-Nova blast!
-(fireballs launch)

00:03:54.755 --> 00:03:56.323
(intense music continues)

00:03:56.356 --> 00:03:57.324
(fireball explodes)

00:03:57.357 --> 00:03:58.325
(Greymon gasps)

00:03:58.358 --> 00:04:00.460
You should try to hit the feet!

00:04:00.494 --> 00:04:02.863
If you keep shooting
then we can throw it off.

00:04:02.896 --> 00:04:04.231
Sounds good.

00:04:04.264 --> 00:04:07.367
(fireballs explode)

00:04:07.401 --> 00:04:08.569
Let's make it rain!

00:04:08.602 --> 00:04:09.736
You got it!

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:12.072
-(Birdramon grunts)
-(meteors blast)

00:04:12.105 --> 00:04:13.073
(Fangmon whimpers)

00:04:13.106 --> 00:04:14.374
Take it down!

00:04:16.543 --> 00:04:18.879
(explosion)

00:04:20.213 --> 00:04:21.214
All right!

00:04:26.787 --> 00:04:29.957
(Garurumon galloping)

00:04:31.892 --> 00:04:34.861
Gotcha, I'm glad
you all joined up.

00:04:34.895 --> 00:04:37.264
I hope T.K. didn't
get hurt out there.

00:04:37.297 --> 00:04:39.266
It was scary, but
they rescued us.

00:04:39.299 --> 00:04:40.867
I'm fine.

00:04:40.901 --> 00:04:42.703
I'm worried about
Patamon though.

00:04:42.736 --> 00:04:43.904
(Patamon sighs)

00:04:43.937 --> 00:04:46.106
He's not looking
so good right now.

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:48.175
Wonder what's got
him so worn out?

00:04:48.208 --> 00:04:51.044
I'm not sure, but he did
soak up a lot of damage

00:04:51.078 --> 00:04:52.779
when we fought AxeKnightmon.

00:04:52.813 --> 00:04:54.615
(T.K. moans)

00:04:54.648 --> 00:04:56.450
-[Matt] Listen, T.K.
-Huh?

00:04:56.483 --> 00:05:00.087
[Matt] I have no doubt that
Patamon's gonna pull through.

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.756
In the meantime, just keep
an eye on him okay, bro?

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:04.625
(T.K. sighs)

00:05:04.658 --> 00:05:07.594
I'll take extra
special care of him.

00:05:07.628 --> 00:05:08.795
[Matt] Good.

00:05:08.829 --> 00:05:11.231
And Tai, make sure T.K.
stays in one piece.

00:05:11.264 --> 00:05:13.400
-Yeah, you got it.
-(Digivice beeps)

00:05:13.433 --> 00:05:15.569
By the way, hear any
word from Mimi's crew?

00:05:15.602 --> 00:05:18.438
[Mimi] Let's go, just like that!

00:05:18.472 --> 00:05:19.806
(all gasp)

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:20.941
Are you good, Mimi?

00:05:20.974 --> 00:05:23.310
(Togemon yells)

00:05:23.343 --> 00:05:25.278
(Golemon growls)

00:05:25.312 --> 00:05:26.380
-That's it!
-(upbeat music)

00:05:26.413 --> 00:05:28.281
Keep it up and show
them who's boss.

00:05:28.315 --> 00:05:29.983
Togemon versus Golemon!

00:05:30.017 --> 00:05:31.752
Get ready for the big finish.

00:05:31.785 --> 00:05:33.754
(Gotsumon laughs)

00:05:33.787 --> 00:05:35.622
Chiku Chiku Ban Ban!

00:05:36.957 --> 00:05:38.925
(Mimi laughs)

00:05:38.959 --> 00:05:41.328
Sounds like they're totally
living it up over there.

00:05:41.361 --> 00:05:43.430
Aw, I wish I could join in too.

00:05:43.463 --> 00:05:45.132
-Should we check on Joe?
-(Digivice beeps)

00:05:45.165 --> 00:05:48.935
-(Joe crying)
-(all gasp)

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:51.772
I'd really appreciate
a little help here!

00:05:51.805 --> 00:05:54.675
(Joe screams)

00:05:54.708 --> 00:05:57.644
(Gomamon pants)

00:05:57.678 --> 00:05:59.012
I'm coming, Joe.

00:05:59.046 --> 00:06:00.013
(Joe screams)

00:06:00.047 --> 00:06:01.982
[Joe] They're digging
in, I can feel them!

00:06:02.015 --> 00:06:03.817
All the bloods
rushing to my head.

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:05.786
Wait, is it rushing down?

00:06:05.819 --> 00:06:06.987
Well, technically
it's rushing up.

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:07.988
Nope, definitely down.

00:06:08.021 --> 00:06:09.356
Is Joe about to become a snack?

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:11.625
Well, here's hoping
Gomamon can rescue him.

00:06:11.658 --> 00:06:12.859
(Digivice beeps)

00:06:12.893 --> 00:06:14.327
-[Izzy] Come in, everyone.
-(Sora gasps)

00:06:14.361 --> 00:06:15.662
We're listening, Izzy.

00:06:15.696 --> 00:06:18.532
[Izzy] Things in the real world
have gone from bad to worse.

00:06:18.565 --> 00:06:19.700
(both gasp)

00:06:19.733 --> 00:06:24.738
-(weapons firing)
-(explosions)

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.208
From what I can gather,

00:06:28.241 --> 00:06:30.343
it seems the rumors
about those satellites

00:06:30.377 --> 00:06:33.046
potentially crashing into the
international space station

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:34.848
have somehow leaked
to the public.

00:06:34.881 --> 00:06:37.184
So, of course, the whole
Internet's blowing up.

00:06:37.217 --> 00:06:39.052
And timelines are all
flooded with theories

00:06:39.086 --> 00:06:40.353
and misinformation.

00:06:40.387 --> 00:06:43.824
Because of that the dark
energy has intensified.

00:06:43.857 --> 00:06:47.894
-(explosion)
-(Izzy gasps)

00:06:47.928 --> 00:06:50.063
And it's not showing
signs of slowing down.

00:06:50.097 --> 00:06:51.998
This is going to
be bad, isn't it?

00:06:52.032 --> 00:06:54.367
Like maybe even
worse than last time.

00:06:54.401 --> 00:06:56.336
(Patamon groans)

00:06:56.369 --> 00:06:58.772
(soft music)

00:07:04.444 --> 00:07:06.246
(bell dings)

00:07:06.279 --> 00:07:07.280
Patamon.

00:07:08.248 --> 00:07:10.350
Hello, Celestial Digimon.

00:07:10.383 --> 00:07:12.753
(Patamon whimpers)

00:07:12.786 --> 00:07:16.056
(soft music continues)

00:07:17.124 --> 00:07:18.592
Listen to me.

00:07:18.625 --> 00:07:20.060
Can you hear my voice?

00:07:21.895 --> 00:07:22.929
(Patamon gasps)

00:07:22.963 --> 00:07:25.031
Who are you?

00:07:25.065 --> 00:07:26.733
I recognize your voice

00:07:26.767 --> 00:07:29.536
but I don't know where
I've heard it before.

00:07:29.569 --> 00:07:32.806
(soft music continues)

00:07:46.653 --> 00:07:47.621
[Lopmon] The dark abyss.

00:07:47.654 --> 00:07:49.055
Reincarnation.

00:07:49.089 --> 00:07:50.457
Warfare.

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:54.594
This must be the cost of
overcoming so many adversities.

00:07:54.628 --> 00:07:56.763
It appears a great
deal of your powers,

00:07:56.797 --> 00:07:58.398
as well as your memories,

00:07:58.431 --> 00:08:01.434
have been lost through
these struggles.

00:08:01.468 --> 00:08:02.969
(soft music continues)

00:08:03.003 --> 00:08:04.838
Please, I'm so tired.

00:08:05.939 --> 00:08:08.308
Yes, but you mustn't
give up hope.

00:08:08.341 --> 00:08:09.643
The Celestial Digimon

00:08:09.676 --> 00:08:13.246
and the Digi-Destined
are bound by fate.

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:16.983
Once you unite your hearts and
bravely walk forward as one,

00:08:17.017 --> 00:08:21.254
then, and only then, shall
you uncover a new path.

00:08:21.288 --> 00:08:22.289
[Patamon] Unite?

00:08:23.023 --> 00:08:24.624
You mean with T.K.?

00:08:26.126 --> 00:08:28.361
No, wait, please come back.

00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:32.165
[Lopmon] We are
those of the past.

00:08:32.199 --> 00:08:35.268
A hollow entity
with no power left

00:08:35.302 --> 00:08:38.271
other than what we can
muster to reach you.

00:08:38.305 --> 00:08:41.641
Patamon, you are the
only one alive today

00:08:41.675 --> 00:08:44.344
who possesses the holy powers.

00:08:44.377 --> 00:08:46.279
Become a beacon.

00:08:46.313 --> 00:08:49.015
The light of hope to
brighten the world.

00:08:49.883 --> 00:08:52.152
(shimmering)

00:08:52.185 --> 00:08:53.153
Light of what?

00:08:53.186 --> 00:08:54.154
(everyone gasps)

00:08:54.187 --> 00:08:55.689
You're finally awake!

00:08:55.722 --> 00:08:58.345
(Patamon whimpers)

00:09:02.174 --> 00:09:04.142
(wind rushing)

00:09:09.214 --> 00:09:12.017
(Patamon sighs)

00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:14.486
(T.K. sighs)

00:09:18.657 --> 00:09:22.327
The light of hope, to
brighten the world.

00:09:22.361 --> 00:09:23.795
Huh?

00:09:23.829 --> 00:09:24.796
(Patamon grunts)

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:27.866
(wings flapping)

00:09:27.899 --> 00:09:30.535
(Patamon whining)

00:09:30.569 --> 00:09:31.970
(T.K. sighs)

00:09:32.004 --> 00:09:34.740
(Patamon whines)

00:09:36.541 --> 00:09:39.211
(Patamon pants)

00:09:39.244 --> 00:09:42.547
Honestly, at this
rate it's impossible.

00:09:42.581 --> 00:09:45.217
I can't protect
T.K. or anyone else.

00:09:48.353 --> 00:09:49.855
(Patamon gasps)

00:09:49.888 --> 00:09:52.357
Say, do you know how
to swim, Patamon?

00:09:52.391 --> 00:09:53.392
Huh?

00:09:54.192 --> 00:09:55.360
It's so funny,

00:09:55.394 --> 00:09:57.729
a while back I could
barely even tread water.

00:09:59.231 --> 00:10:00.899
I don't follow.

00:10:00.932 --> 00:10:02.668
I was scared of going under

00:10:02.701 --> 00:10:04.870
and I got winded pretty easily.

00:10:04.903 --> 00:10:06.872
But still, I remember
Matt telling me

00:10:06.905 --> 00:10:08.340
that it was just
a matter of time

00:10:08.373 --> 00:10:10.409
before I learned
how to doggy paddle.

00:10:10.442 --> 00:10:12.177
-And you know what?
-(hopeful music)

00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:13.679
He was right!

00:10:13.712 --> 00:10:17.249
And until I could finally swim
on my own, he stuck with me.

00:10:17.282 --> 00:10:19.017
(Patamon sighs)

00:10:19.051 --> 00:10:22.721
So as long as it takes,
I'm sticking with you.

00:10:24.122 --> 00:10:25.123
T.K.

00:10:26.124 --> 00:10:27.259
(T.K. giggles)

00:10:27.292 --> 00:10:31.263
-(distant growling)
-(both gasp)

00:10:31.296 --> 00:10:33.932
(ominous music)

00:10:33.965 --> 00:10:36.101
[Tai] Something's coming.

00:10:36.134 --> 00:10:38.270
Not Fangmon again.

00:10:38.303 --> 00:10:40.605
(Fangmon growls)

00:10:40.639 --> 00:10:42.941
(Komondomon barks)

00:10:42.974 --> 00:10:45.043
(all yell)

00:10:45.077 --> 00:10:46.778
(teeth glimmer)

00:10:46.812 --> 00:10:48.280
Nasty.

00:10:48.313 --> 00:10:51.216
Are they trying to catch up
so they can scarf us down?

00:10:52.317 --> 00:10:54.119
-Ready, buddy?
-(Agumon grunts in agreement)

00:10:54.152 --> 00:10:56.221
(Digivice whirring)

00:10:56.254 --> 00:10:58.256
Agumon Digivolve to...

00:11:00.158 --> 00:11:01.159
Greymon.

00:11:02.461 --> 00:11:04.229
Let's go, we'll
get 'em this time!

00:11:04.262 --> 00:11:06.231
(explosion)

00:11:06.264 --> 00:11:08.567
(Komondomon whimpers)

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.469
[Sora] Oh, good, some
super creepy clouds.

00:11:10.502 --> 00:11:13.472
(thunder strikes)

00:11:13.505 --> 00:11:15.273
What do you think it is?

00:11:15.307 --> 00:11:18.810
-(ominous music builds)
-(thunder strikes)

00:11:18.844 --> 00:11:21.480
(Tai gasps)

00:11:21.513 --> 00:11:23.815
(thunder strikes)

00:11:23.849 --> 00:11:25.784
(Biyomon gasps)

00:11:25.817 --> 00:11:28.587
(thunder strikes)

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:30.422
(Sora gasps)

00:11:30.455 --> 00:11:32.924
(thunder strikes)

00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:35.093
(T.K. gasps)

00:11:35.127 --> 00:11:37.329
(thunder strikes)

00:11:37.362 --> 00:11:40.031
(Patamon gasps)

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:46.004
-(ominous music continues)
-(thunder strikes)

00:11:46.037 --> 00:11:48.840
(thunder strikes)

00:11:52.811 --> 00:11:55.847
(glimmering sound)

00:11:55.881 --> 00:11:58.550
(ominous music)

00:11:59.651 --> 00:12:02.120
(Cerberumon's
footsteps thumping)

00:12:02.154 --> 00:12:04.189
(Tai groans)

00:12:04.222 --> 00:12:06.825
(ominous music continues)

00:12:06.858 --> 00:12:09.861
(Cerberumon growls)

00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:12.964
(ominous music continues)

00:12:12.998 --> 00:12:15.367
That giant must be who
the Fangmon answer to.

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:17.469
The big guy's name
is Cerberumon.

00:12:17.502 --> 00:12:19.137
An Ultimate Digimon.

00:12:19.171 --> 00:12:22.007
(power building)

00:12:23.575 --> 00:12:26.044
Yo, Komondomon, make
a left turn ASAP!

00:12:26.077 --> 00:12:31.082
-(explosion)
-(ominous music continues)

00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:33.118
(Tai gasps)

00:12:33.151 --> 00:12:36.321
If we get hit by a single
one of those, we're done for.

00:12:38.089 --> 00:12:41.893
(Fangmon's footsteps thumping)

00:12:41.927 --> 00:12:43.161
(Fangmon shoots beam)

00:12:43.195 --> 00:12:46.064
-(Tai yells)
-(Greymon grunts)

00:12:46.097 --> 00:12:48.066
Hey, Greymon! Think
you can deal for now?

00:12:48.099 --> 00:12:49.067
Yeah!

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:51.236
(Greymon grunts)

00:12:51.269 --> 00:12:55.574
-(Patamon whimpers)
-(T.K. whimpers)

00:12:55.607 --> 00:12:57.509
(Greymon yells)

00:12:57.542 --> 00:12:59.344
Why you little...

00:12:59.377 --> 00:13:02.347
(Greymon yells)

00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:04.916
(weapons firing)

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:05.917
(explosions)

00:13:05.951 --> 00:13:08.720
(Komondomon whimpers)

00:13:08.753 --> 00:13:09.855
Greymon!

00:13:09.888 --> 00:13:11.723
Yeah, that's my bad.

00:13:12.591 --> 00:13:13.692
(power building)

00:13:13.725 --> 00:13:16.928
[Tai] Here comes another shot.

00:13:16.962 --> 00:13:19.064
Hang a right, Komondomon!

00:13:21.399 --> 00:13:23.768
(explosion)

00:13:26.571 --> 00:13:29.541
We need to speed it up or
else we're gonna be roasted!

00:13:29.574 --> 00:13:31.209
(Komondomon whimpers)

00:13:31.243 --> 00:13:32.611
(Digivice beeps and whirs)

00:13:32.644 --> 00:13:36.548
-Okay, you ready Biyomon?
-(Biyomon grunts in agreement)

00:13:36.581 --> 00:13:38.650
Biyomon Digivolve to...

00:13:39.818 --> 00:13:40.819
Birdramon.

00:13:41.653 --> 00:13:43.255
Meteor wing!

00:13:43.288 --> 00:13:45.123
(meteors firing)

00:13:45.156 --> 00:13:48.293
(explosions)

00:13:48.326 --> 00:13:50.128
(Cerberumon growls)

00:13:50.161 --> 00:13:52.764
(Birdramon gasps)

00:13:52.797 --> 00:13:53.965
(Tai moans)

00:13:53.999 --> 00:13:57.002
(Cerberumon growls)

00:13:59.304 --> 00:14:00.772
-(explosions)
-[Tai] Dodge to the right.

00:14:00.805 --> 00:14:01.773
Go left.

00:14:01.806 --> 00:14:03.275
Left!

00:14:03.308 --> 00:14:07.779
-(explosions)
-(ominous music)

00:14:07.812 --> 00:14:09.981
Nice footwork, Komondomon!

00:14:10.448 --> 00:14:11.550
(power building)

00:14:11.583 --> 00:14:13.919
[Sora] Oh no, they're charging
up for a group attack.

00:14:17.122 --> 00:14:19.190
Greymon Digivolve to...

00:14:23.528 --> 00:14:25.864
MetalGreymon.

00:14:29.334 --> 00:14:31.303
Giga Storm!

00:14:31.836 --> 00:14:34.506
(ominous music)

00:14:43.014 --> 00:14:44.282
(explosion)

00:14:44.316 --> 00:14:47.385
(Komondomon whimpers)

00:14:49.654 --> 00:14:52.290
(MetalGreymon gasps)

00:14:52.324 --> 00:14:54.693
(Digivice beeps and whirs)

00:14:54.726 --> 00:14:56.995
Birdramon Digivolve to...

00:14:59.064 --> 00:15:00.665
Garudamon!

00:15:00.699 --> 00:15:03.201
(Garudamon grunts)

00:15:03.234 --> 00:15:04.836
[MetalGreymon] Nice puppy.

00:15:04.869 --> 00:15:06.171
(MetalGreymon grunts)

00:15:06.204 --> 00:15:08.039
(Garudamon strains)

00:15:08.073 --> 00:15:09.040
(MetalGreymon groans)

00:15:09.074 --> 00:15:10.041
(Garudamon gasps)

00:15:10.075 --> 00:15:11.042
It took them down.

00:15:11.076 --> 00:15:12.844
Come on, hang in there you two.

00:15:12.877 --> 00:15:15.380
(ominous music)

00:15:15.413 --> 00:15:17.482
(MetalGreymon pants)

00:15:17.515 --> 00:15:19.184
(ominous music)

00:15:19.217 --> 00:15:20.819
(Fangmons growl)

00:15:20.852 --> 00:15:23.521
(ominous music)

00:15:25.423 --> 00:15:27.726
(MetalGreymon sighs)

00:15:27.759 --> 00:15:29.995
(explosion)

00:15:30.028 --> 00:15:31.730
(Komondomon whimpers)

00:15:31.763 --> 00:15:32.731
Go right!

00:15:32.764 --> 00:15:34.032
No, Left!

00:15:34.065 --> 00:15:35.066
Left again!

00:15:36.101 --> 00:15:38.570
-(T.K. whimpering)
-(Sora stomping)

00:15:38.603 --> 00:15:40.305
Come on now, it's not safe.

00:15:40.338 --> 00:15:42.007
You should both head
inside right away.

00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:46.611
-(explosion)
-(both yell)

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:49.581
(Tai coughs)

00:15:49.614 --> 00:15:52.083
Hey Sora, T.K., Patamon,

00:15:52.117 --> 00:15:53.785
tell me you're okay.

00:15:54.619 --> 00:15:56.755
Sora, wake up.

00:15:56.788 --> 00:15:58.857
(Sora groans)

00:15:58.890 --> 00:16:02.093
Sora, you can't
go out like this.

00:16:02.127 --> 00:16:03.561
I'll be fine.

00:16:04.596 --> 00:16:05.864
(Sora whimpers)

00:16:05.897 --> 00:16:06.865
Sora!

00:16:06.898 --> 00:16:07.866
-(explosion)
-(Tai yells)

00:16:07.899 --> 00:16:10.735
(Tai grunts)

00:16:10.769 --> 00:16:13.571
(Tai strains)

00:16:13.605 --> 00:16:16.608
(Tai pants)

00:16:16.641 --> 00:16:17.876
Tai.

00:16:17.909 --> 00:16:20.712
(Sora pants)

00:16:20.745 --> 00:16:24.883
-(Patamon whines)
-(explosions)

00:16:24.916 --> 00:16:27.986
(slow, gentle music)

00:16:31.122 --> 00:16:32.590
What should I do?

00:16:32.624 --> 00:16:36.294
Once you unite your hearts and
bravely walk forward as one

00:16:36.327 --> 00:16:40.165
then, and only then, shall
you uncover a new path.

00:16:41.332 --> 00:16:43.968
As long as it takes,
I'm sticking with you.

00:16:46.004 --> 00:16:47.005
That's right.

00:16:49.307 --> 00:16:53.478
I've been lost in the
darkness for such a long time.

00:16:53.511 --> 00:16:56.489
A hopeless abyss
where I was alone.

00:17:00.627 --> 00:17:01.861
(water bubbling)

00:17:01.895 --> 00:17:04.564
So much time passed that
I almost forgot who I was.

00:17:05.665 --> 00:17:07.901
(dramatic cello music)

00:17:07.934 --> 00:17:11.104
It was like my mind
almost faded away.

00:17:14.641 --> 00:17:15.642
But then...

00:17:18.111 --> 00:17:19.479
T.K.!

00:17:19.512 --> 00:17:23.650
In spite of everything I
never ever forgot about T.K.

00:17:23.683 --> 00:17:26.986
It's because I knew,
deep in my heart,

00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:29.322
that I would meet him one day.

00:17:29.355 --> 00:17:32.325
So I didn't give up
and neither did T.K.

00:17:32.358 --> 00:17:34.627
(dramatic cello music continues)

00:17:34.661 --> 00:17:36.763
That's how we were able to meet.

00:17:36.796 --> 00:17:39.099
Even after I was reborn

00:17:39.132 --> 00:17:41.634
we were able to see
each other again.

00:17:41.668 --> 00:17:44.504
Because of the will
to keep on trying.

00:17:44.537 --> 00:17:46.506
That's why T.K. is my hope.

00:17:46.539 --> 00:17:50.443
In the same special
way, I am T.K.'s hope.

00:17:51.211 --> 00:17:54.814
Because the Celestial
Digimon are everybody's hope.

00:17:56.182 --> 00:17:57.517
(T.K. grunts)

00:17:57.550 --> 00:17:59.986
(Patamon grunts)

00:18:00.019 --> 00:18:02.388
(explosions)

00:18:04.157 --> 00:18:05.458
(Fangmons thump onto Komondomon)

00:18:05.492 --> 00:18:08.161
(ominous music)

00:18:09.162 --> 00:18:12.198
(Fangmons growl)

00:18:12.232 --> 00:18:14.734
(all whimper)

00:18:15.869 --> 00:18:16.836
(Fangmon's footsteps thump)

00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:18.204
What are you doing?

00:18:18.238 --> 00:18:20.039
Save yourselves.

00:18:20.073 --> 00:18:21.975
Get out of here.

00:18:22.008 --> 00:18:25.578
(Fangmons growl and stomp)

00:18:30.250 --> 00:18:33.052
Guess this means we're
the last ones standing.

00:18:33.086 --> 00:18:35.889
That doesn't matter as
long as you are by my side.

00:18:35.922 --> 00:18:38.057
Then we've still got
a fighting chance.

00:18:38.091 --> 00:18:40.527
I might not be as big
as Angemon, but...

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:42.028
We're protecting our friends!

00:18:42.061 --> 00:18:43.830
Together we're unstoppable!

00:18:43.863 --> 00:18:48.735
-(upbeat, hopeful music)
-(Digivice beeps and whirs)

00:18:48.768 --> 00:18:50.937
Patamon Digivolve to...

00:18:57.710 --> 00:19:01.881
(singing in Japanese)

00:19:04.751 --> 00:19:06.586
Pegasusmon!

00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:08.588
(T.K. gasps)

00:19:08.621 --> 00:19:10.523
It's real nice to meet you!

00:19:10.557 --> 00:19:11.558
Amazing.

00:19:12.559 --> 00:19:14.093
A new form?

00:19:14.127 --> 00:19:15.528
Incredible!

00:19:15.562 --> 00:19:18.698
(upbeat, hopeful,
Japanese music continues)

00:19:18.731 --> 00:19:20.800
Let's do this thing, Pegasusmon!

00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:22.101
All right.

00:19:22.468 --> 00:19:27.106
(upbeat, hopeful,
Japanese music continues)

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:29.442
(Fangmons growl)

00:19:29.475 --> 00:19:30.743
Here we go!

00:19:30.777 --> 00:19:32.545
Now show them what you've got!

00:19:32.579 --> 00:19:33.646
Equus Beam!

00:19:35.815 --> 00:19:37.383
(upbeat, hopeful,
Japanese music continues)

00:19:37.417 --> 00:19:38.384
Perfect.

00:19:38.418 --> 00:19:40.119
Now let's make a
U-ie, Komondomon!

00:19:40.153 --> 00:19:42.288
(Komondomon barks)

00:19:42.322 --> 00:19:44.123
(upbeat, hopeful,
Japanese music continues)

00:19:44.157 --> 00:19:47.093
(Garudamon grunts)

00:19:48.595 --> 00:19:50.897
Alright, looks like
we're in the clear.

00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:52.632
Time to wrap this up.

00:19:52.665 --> 00:19:57.670
(upbeat, hopeful,
Japanese music continues)

00:20:02.275 --> 00:20:04.244
(powering up)

00:20:04.277 --> 00:20:05.812
You've got this, Pegasusmon!

00:20:05.845 --> 00:20:07.146
Aim right for the mouth!

00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:08.915
Rodeo Kick!

00:20:08.948 --> 00:20:11.417
(whirring)

00:20:11.451 --> 00:20:15.421
(upbeat, hopeful,
Japanese music continues)

00:20:15.455 --> 00:20:18.091
(explosion)

00:20:18.124 --> 00:20:23.129
(upbeat, hopeful,
Japanese music continues)

00:20:27.533 --> 00:20:30.003
(T.K. laughs)

00:20:33.039 --> 00:20:36.009
(Cerberumon growls)

00:20:38.344 --> 00:20:41.447
(explosion)

00:20:41.481 --> 00:20:42.715
Giga Blaster!

00:20:46.319 --> 00:20:47.320
Equus Beam!

00:20:48.855 --> 00:20:53.826
(upbeat, hopeful,
Japanese music ends)

00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:07.540
(calm, hopeful music)

00:21:11.744 --> 00:21:13.146
See that sunshine?

00:21:13.179 --> 00:21:14.147
We did it.

00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:15.882
We both pulled
through in the end.

00:21:15.915 --> 00:21:16.883
That's right.

00:21:16.916 --> 00:21:18.384
(T.K. sighs)

00:21:18.418 --> 00:21:20.186
(calm, hopeful music continues)

00:21:20.219 --> 00:21:22.555
(all gasp)

00:21:22.588 --> 00:21:26.059
Here's to new wings,
and to new hope.

00:21:26.092 --> 00:21:30.096
(calm, hopeful music continues)

00:21:33.433 --> 00:21:35.868
(both laugh)

00:21:39.339 --> 00:21:40.306

[Izzy] The Digimon Encyclopedia!

00:22:43.169 --> 00:22:44.570
Komondomon.

00:22:44.604 --> 00:22:47.707
This Digimon enjoys transporting
passengers and running.

00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:49.409
It seems they run
around open fields

00:22:49.442 --> 00:22:51.577
in the same way
that we go on walks.

00:22:51.611 --> 00:22:54.147
Now let's check out some
more facts about them.

00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:56.649
They have eight legs
under long, shaggy fur

00:22:56.682 --> 00:22:58.918
and can travel through
any type of terrain.

00:22:58.951 --> 00:22:59.919
You know what?

00:22:59.952 --> 00:23:01.587
It'd be kind of cool if
they could tap dance.

00:23:01.621 --> 00:23:03.790
I wonder if someone
could give them lessons?

00:23:07.126 --> 00:23:09.162
Which Digimon will
it be next time?

00:23:10.329 --> 00:23:13.266
[Narrator] Kari soon
finds herself devoured

00:23:13.299 --> 00:23:14.667
by the darkness.

00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:17.103
Will Tai be able to
rescue his little sister

00:23:17.136 --> 00:23:18.504
before it's too late?

00:23:18.538 --> 00:23:20.473
[Tai] Next time:
The Kari of Dawn.

00:23:20.506 --> 00:23:23.142
[Narrator] The adventure
continues in a new world.
