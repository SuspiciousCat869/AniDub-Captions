00:00:11.645 --> 00:00:14.949
[Izzy] The Digimon Encyclopedia!

00:00:14.982 --> 00:00:16.250
Tentomon.

00:00:16.283 --> 00:00:18.218
This Digimon is my
very own partner.

00:00:18.252 --> 00:00:21.388
Underneath that shell,
are a set of thin wings.

00:00:21.422 --> 00:00:24.558
That means Tentomon can fly
me around whenever I want!

00:00:24.592 --> 00:00:26.460
Now check this out!

00:00:26.493 --> 00:00:27.728
Tentomon sometimes speaks

00:00:27.761 --> 00:00:30.464
like someone from the
Kansai region of Japan.

00:00:30.497 --> 00:00:33.567
I have no idea why and I
don't know what that means!

00:00:33.601 --> 00:00:35.970
I should ask about it
when I get a chance.

00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:40.174
Which Digimon will
it be next time?

00:00:42.776 --> 00:00:43.744

[Narrator] CannonBeemon had
been capturing FanBeemon

00:02:14.843 --> 00:02:17.980
to turn them into their foot
soldiers in the Digital World.

00:02:21.316 --> 00:02:25.020
Sora's group happened to pass
by and saw what was happening.

00:02:25.054 --> 00:02:29.191
However, in the process, Joe
and Gomamon were captured.

00:02:32.227 --> 00:02:36.031
In order to save Joe,
Gomamon, and FanBeemon,

00:02:36.065 --> 00:02:39.701
the Digidestined took on
CannonBeemon and, in the end,

00:02:39.735 --> 00:02:42.071
successfully rescued
the captives!

00:02:45.207 --> 00:02:47.009
And it was during that battle

00:02:47.042 --> 00:02:50.679
that Birdramon managed to
digivolve into Garudamon.

00:03:02.024 --> 00:03:05.060
(upbeat music)

00:03:05.094 --> 00:03:06.161
You know,

00:03:06.195 --> 00:03:08.330
I could just carry everyone
if you'd prefer that!

00:03:08.363 --> 00:03:09.331
No, that's okay.

00:03:09.364 --> 00:03:11.700
It'll be tough on you if
you need to keep flying.

00:03:11.733 --> 00:03:13.368
You need to get some
rest, too, you know!

00:03:13.402 --> 00:03:16.238
That's right. Just
hop on, too, Biyomon.

00:03:16.271 --> 00:03:18.574
Right! Oh, thank goodness!

00:03:18.607 --> 00:03:21.710
Hey, why don't you guys come
hop on up here with us, too?

00:03:21.743 --> 00:03:24.880
It's nice and high off the
ground, and it's super comfy!

00:03:25.948 --> 00:03:28.183
He's calling us. You listening?

00:03:28.217 --> 00:03:32.087
It's like a hammock! I
swear you're gonna like it!

00:03:32.121 --> 00:03:34.423
Joe, careful. You'll fall again.

00:03:34.456 --> 00:03:37.860
Hey! Matt! Can't you hear me?

00:03:37.893 --> 00:03:39.761
Are you trying to
get some exercise?

00:03:39.795 --> 00:03:41.763
Is it leg day or something?

00:03:41.797 --> 00:03:43.065
Oh, wait, I get it!

00:03:43.098 --> 00:03:45.067
You're being our advance
scout, is that it?

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.101
Uh, hey, Matt?

00:03:46.135 --> 00:03:47.236
Look, it's fine.

00:03:48.737 --> 00:03:49.872
[Biyomon] What's
an advance scout?

00:03:49.905 --> 00:03:52.074
[Sora] I don't know.

00:03:52.107 --> 00:03:53.275
[Joe] You don't?!

00:03:53.308 --> 00:03:55.611
Well, as the oldest, Joe here
will share his knowledge!

00:03:55.644 --> 00:03:57.079
Now pay attention.

00:03:57.112 --> 00:03:59.615
(car crashes)

00:04:00.983 --> 00:04:02.885
[Host] The cause of the
widespread power outage

00:04:02.918 --> 00:04:05.921
in the metropolitan area
still remains a mystery.

00:04:05.954 --> 00:04:08.223
We've had reports of
accidents and disasters

00:04:08.257 --> 00:04:10.259
across the whole area.

00:04:10.292 --> 00:04:11.960
Fire department
officials have announced

00:04:11.994 --> 00:04:13.729
that the outage has
complicated their efforts

00:04:13.762 --> 00:04:15.631
to put out ongoing fires,

00:04:15.664 --> 00:04:17.733
so they're asking people
to be extra cautious

00:04:17.766 --> 00:04:19.902
with flammable materials.

00:04:19.935 --> 00:04:21.470
Also, a growing number of people

00:04:21.503 --> 00:04:22.971
have become trapped in elevators

00:04:23.005 --> 00:04:25.140
and are currently
awaiting rescue.

00:04:25.174 --> 00:04:26.475
Officials are asking that

00:04:26.508 --> 00:04:28.443
if you live in a
multi-story housing complex

00:04:28.477 --> 00:04:30.812
or are in another tall
building right now,

00:04:30.846 --> 00:04:34.049
please go and check elevators
that might be nearby.

00:04:45.494 --> 00:04:47.863
(wind howls)

00:04:51.033 --> 00:04:53.335
[Agumon] This place
looks totally crazy!

00:04:53.368 --> 00:04:55.771
It's like a natural
maze just grew here!

00:04:55.804 --> 00:04:56.972
Yeah, right?

00:04:57.005 --> 00:04:58.674
The pathways are
so twisty and turny

00:04:58.707 --> 00:05:01.176
with a hefty dose of
squiggly thrown in!

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.680
What happens if we get lost
and can't get back out again?

00:05:04.713 --> 00:05:05.981
I'm scared!

00:05:06.014 --> 00:05:07.783
There's really no
need to be worried.

00:05:07.816 --> 00:05:10.819
After all, they say there's no
puzzle that can't be solved.

00:05:10.852 --> 00:05:12.321
I'm sure that this
maze will be--

00:05:12.354 --> 00:05:13.855
(computer crackles)

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:16.124
Oh, no! It happened again!

00:05:16.158 --> 00:05:17.826
I've lost all reception!

00:05:18.694 --> 00:05:21.530
Well, if worse comes to
worst, not saying it will,

00:05:21.563 --> 00:05:23.465
I can guide you from above.

00:05:23.498 --> 00:05:25.367
Us getting lost
would be bad enough,

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.703
but let's try not to
get separated, either.

00:05:27.736 --> 00:05:30.706
This place has a layout
that may make it difficult

00:05:30.739 --> 00:05:32.808
for us to communicate
with our Digivices.

00:05:32.841 --> 00:05:34.009
That's a good point.

00:05:34.042 --> 00:05:36.478
(Mimi giggles)

00:05:36.511 --> 00:05:38.313
Palmon, your face
looks so weird!

00:05:38.347 --> 00:05:41.016
Yeah, I know! Yours
looks weird, too, Mimi!

00:05:41.049 --> 00:05:43.385
What if I really
looked like this?

00:05:43.418 --> 00:05:45.053
(both giggle)

00:05:45.087 --> 00:05:46.688
What's going on, you guys?

00:05:47.522 --> 00:05:48.824
Just look!

00:05:48.857 --> 00:05:50.025
Funny, huh?

00:05:50.058 --> 00:05:52.894
Oh, yeah! Everybody's
face looks weird!

00:05:52.928 --> 00:05:55.063
This is just like those
things at amusement parks.

00:05:55.097 --> 00:05:56.698
Funhouse mirrors.

00:05:56.732 --> 00:05:58.734
It appears that when something
uncovers the minerals

00:05:58.767 --> 00:06:01.169
that can be found in the
interior of these rocks,

00:06:01.203 --> 00:06:03.405
they become reflective
just like mirrors are.

00:06:03.438 --> 00:06:06.174
Hang on a second,
let me analyze it.

00:06:06.208 --> 00:06:09.578
Oh. That's right.
It's not working.

00:06:09.611 --> 00:06:10.612
Oh.

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:13.682
(wings flap)

00:06:13.715 --> 00:06:15.050
-That's too bad.
-Tai!

00:06:15.083 --> 00:06:16.051
(rumbling in the distance)

00:06:16.084 --> 00:06:18.520
Uh, what was that?

00:06:18.553 --> 00:06:20.789
(all gasp)

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:26.428
(gasps)

00:06:26.461 --> 00:06:27.429
Hey, look!

00:06:27.462 --> 00:06:29.097
(all gasp)

00:06:29.131 --> 00:06:31.933
(shrieks)

00:06:31.967 --> 00:06:33.568
That Digimon is...

00:06:34.903 --> 00:06:36.772
It's no good. I can't
look anything up!

00:06:36.805 --> 00:06:39.241
Izzy, let me introduce
you to Kuwagamon!

00:06:40.575 --> 00:06:42.778
They're very nasty!
Emphasis on very.

00:06:42.811 --> 00:06:44.546
And extra emphasis on nasty!

00:06:44.579 --> 00:06:46.748
(shrieks)

00:06:49.584 --> 00:06:51.253
There's more!

00:06:51.286 --> 00:06:55.223
[Mimi] One, two, three, four.
There are five of them?!

00:06:55.257 --> 00:06:57.225
[Izzy] We're trapped!
They have us surrounded!

00:06:57.259 --> 00:06:59.928
[Tai] Here they come!

00:06:59.961 --> 00:07:03.098
(Digivices beep)

00:07:03.131 --> 00:07:04.599
Palmon digivolve to...

00:07:04.633 --> 00:07:06.234
Tentomon digivolve to...

00:07:06.268 --> 00:07:08.270
Agumon digivolve to...

00:07:12.441 --> 00:07:13.575
Togemon!

00:07:13.608 --> 00:07:14.943
Kabuterimon!

00:07:14.976 --> 00:07:15.977
Greymon!

00:07:18.847 --> 00:07:20.949
(grunts)

00:07:25.854 --> 00:07:27.322
(grunts)

00:07:27.356 --> 00:07:28.657
Needle Spray!

00:07:33.662 --> 00:07:35.097
Togemon!

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:36.431
(screams)

00:07:36.465 --> 00:07:37.999
What the...?

00:07:38.033 --> 00:07:39.501
What was that?!

00:07:39.534 --> 00:07:42.971
It's got so many claws and
they're all super sharp!

00:07:43.004 --> 00:07:44.172
(grunts)

00:07:44.206 --> 00:07:46.975
All right, let's
see who's stronger!

00:07:50.212 --> 00:07:52.147
Get him, Kabuterimon!

00:07:56.017 --> 00:07:58.053
(grunts)

00:08:00.822 --> 00:08:02.824
(pants)

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:08.029
(both grunt)

00:08:12.834 --> 00:08:14.336
Electro Shocker!

00:08:21.176 --> 00:08:22.344
Kabuterimon!

00:08:23.678 --> 00:08:25.147
(Kabuterimon groans)

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:28.216
Kabuterimon would stand a
chance if it were one-on-one.

00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:31.860
If I could just figure
out their attack pattern.

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:33.438
(Izzy groans)

00:08:38.318 --> 00:08:39.986
(grunts)

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:42.155
(gasps)

00:08:42.189 --> 00:08:44.324
(grunts)

00:08:47.227 --> 00:08:48.728
Coconut Counter!

00:08:51.064 --> 00:08:53.834
(Greymon grunts)

00:08:56.336 --> 00:08:57.504
Oh, Tai!

00:08:57.537 --> 00:08:59.639
Mimi! Togemon! Thanks
for the help, you guys!

00:08:59.673 --> 00:09:01.875
(all gasp)

00:09:03.043 --> 00:09:04.211
No, Kabuterimon!

00:09:04.244 --> 00:09:07.047
(gasps) That's
gonna leave a mark.

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:08.648
Izzy, what happened?

00:09:08.682 --> 00:09:09.883
[Izzy] Those Kuwagamon

00:09:09.916 --> 00:09:11.485
look like they're
attacking randomly,

00:09:11.518 --> 00:09:12.986
but there's more to it.

00:09:13.019 --> 00:09:15.355
They're actually moving in
coordination with each other

00:09:15.388 --> 00:09:17.357
based on their exact positions.

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:20.694
This fight is really
more like a hunt!

00:09:20.727 --> 00:09:22.529
Then does that mean
we're their prey?

00:09:22.562 --> 00:09:24.064
We're in a real pickle, here.

00:09:24.097 --> 00:09:25.499
And I hate pickles.

00:09:25.532 --> 00:09:27.734
(all gasp)

00:09:30.537 --> 00:09:33.006
(shrieks)

00:09:33.039 --> 00:09:35.275
(all pant)

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:38.211
It's narrower here,

00:09:38.245 --> 00:09:41.014
so, they won't be able to
swarm over us like flies!

00:09:41.047 --> 00:09:44.751
But until we completely shake
them off, we can't relax.

00:09:44.784 --> 00:09:47.220
I just hope that it isn't
a dead-end up ahead.

00:09:48.221 --> 00:09:49.189
[Mimi] What?!

00:09:49.222 --> 00:09:51.625
(wings buzz)

00:09:52.959 --> 00:09:55.095
Izzy, they're gonna
catch up soon.

00:09:55.128 --> 00:09:56.596
We've gotta keep moving.

00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:57.931
You're right.

00:09:57.964 --> 00:10:00.133
(shrieks)

00:10:01.635 --> 00:10:02.602
(all gasp)

00:10:02.636 --> 00:10:03.770
No way!

00:10:03.803 --> 00:10:06.473
(ominous music)

00:10:11.111 --> 00:10:13.113
(shrieks)

00:10:13.146 --> 00:10:15.048
(all whimper)

00:10:15.081 --> 00:10:16.583
What is it now?!

00:10:18.151 --> 00:10:22.756
That... That's an Ultimate
Digimon! Oukuwamon!

00:10:22.789 --> 00:10:26.092
This guy's bad
news. He's no joke!

00:10:27.761 --> 00:10:31.298
Kuwagamon! They've
got us cornered here!

00:10:31.331 --> 00:10:34.234
(energy whirs)

00:10:34.267 --> 00:10:36.636
(all scream)

00:10:39.272 --> 00:10:40.807
Hey, is everybody doing okay?!

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:41.975
(grunts)

00:10:42.008 --> 00:10:43.276
We're good!

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:44.844
Well, except for how
everything hurts!

00:10:48.315 --> 00:10:49.282
(grunts)

00:10:49.316 --> 00:10:50.317
Togemon!

00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:51.318
(screams)

00:10:51.351 --> 00:10:53.453
(grunts)

00:10:58.325 --> 00:11:00.427
(grunts)

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:02.262
(shrieks)

00:11:02.295 --> 00:11:03.830
(grunts)

00:11:03.863 --> 00:11:05.999
Greymon! Kabuterimon!

00:11:06.032 --> 00:11:08.301
(both grunt)

00:11:08.335 --> 00:11:11.671
Ugh, I've had about all I can
take! Can't we do something?

00:11:11.705 --> 00:11:14.107
[Tai] We've got no chance if
we're surrounded like this.

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:16.776
We've gotta find a way to break
through the enemy's lines!

00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:18.445
[Mimi] You mean let's
run away for now?

00:11:18.478 --> 00:11:20.614
I'm on board with that!

00:11:20.647 --> 00:11:22.782
(groans)

00:11:22.816 --> 00:11:25.018
[Izzy] If only this
thing would just work!

00:11:26.353 --> 00:11:29.623
(energy whirs)

00:11:29.656 --> 00:11:31.658
Everyone! Scatter now!

00:11:31.691 --> 00:11:33.994
(all grunt)

00:11:34.728 --> 00:11:35.695
(all scream)

00:11:35.729 --> 00:11:37.831
(grunts)

00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:48.742
(pants)

00:11:49.909 --> 00:11:53.713
You there, Tai? Mimi?
Can you guys hear me?

00:11:55.248 --> 00:11:56.516
It's no use.

00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:58.318
(gasps)

00:11:58.351 --> 00:12:00.920
(energy whirs)

00:12:02.856 --> 00:12:06.860
Izzy! Make sure that you
hold on tight, you hear me?!

00:12:07.894 --> 00:12:11.331
(mid-tempo action music)

00:12:11.364 --> 00:12:14.034
Hey, Greymon! Are
you doing okay?!

00:12:14.067 --> 00:12:15.035
Yeah.

00:12:15.068 --> 00:12:17.070
(shrieks)

00:12:17.103 --> 00:12:19.539
(both grunt)

00:12:21.708 --> 00:12:23.677
At this rate, we won't
be able to do anything!

00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:24.711
(Togemon grunts)

00:12:24.744 --> 00:12:26.846
(gasps)

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:27.847
Togemon!

00:12:27.881 --> 00:12:28.948
Nova Blast!

00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:31.918
(whimpers)

00:12:31.951 --> 00:12:33.720
Mimi! You all right?!

00:12:34.554 --> 00:12:35.755
(screams)

00:12:35.789 --> 00:12:39.092
This maze and the
Kuwagamon! I hate 'em!

00:12:39.125 --> 00:12:41.695
(all grunt)

00:12:41.728 --> 00:12:43.897
Well, they don't seem
to like us, either.

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:46.766
I'm so sorry! But I gotta
call 'em like I see 'em!

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.268
And I do hate 'em!

00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:52.272
Somehow we've managed
to shake them off.

00:12:52.305 --> 00:12:55.442
We need to hurry up and join
back up with the others.

00:12:55.475 --> 00:12:56.943
If we fly too high up,

00:12:56.976 --> 00:12:59.045
we'll get caught
by those bad guys.

00:12:59.079 --> 00:13:01.781
So we'll just have to make
our way through this maze.

00:13:01.815 --> 00:13:03.383
Yeah, sure.

00:13:03.416 --> 00:13:06.953
Izzy, I need your help. Can
you guide me through it?

00:13:09.622 --> 00:13:10.623
Izzy?

00:13:12.292 --> 00:13:13.960
Sorry, I can't.

00:13:13.993 --> 00:13:17.564
If this isn't working, I
can't analyze the data.

00:13:17.597 --> 00:13:19.299
I can't even collect the data.

00:13:22.001 --> 00:13:22.969
(rumbling in the distance)

00:13:23.002 --> 00:13:24.738
(gasps)

00:13:24.771 --> 00:13:27.440
(ominous music)

00:13:30.276 --> 00:13:32.645
(both grunt)

00:13:34.981 --> 00:13:37.650
Man, this guy doesn't
know when to quit!

00:13:37.684 --> 00:13:42.288
Okay, if that's what you want,
you got it! I'll take you on!

00:13:42.322 --> 00:13:43.857
Kabuterimon wait!

00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:47.093
(grunts)

00:13:47.127 --> 00:13:50.597
This is what the spirit
of Digimon is all about!

00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:52.632
(grunts)

00:13:52.665 --> 00:13:55.935
You're not getting
rid of me that easily!

00:13:55.969 --> 00:13:57.303
Electro Shocker!

00:14:05.678 --> 00:14:06.813
(grunts)

00:14:06.846 --> 00:14:08.848
(pants)

00:14:11.151 --> 00:14:14.187
(grunts continue)

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:16.222
(gasps)

00:14:23.163 --> 00:14:26.366
Huh?

00:14:26.399 --> 00:14:27.400
Izzy.

00:14:30.036 --> 00:14:32.071
(grunts)

00:14:34.007 --> 00:14:35.842
(gasps)

00:14:35.875 --> 00:14:37.310
(whimpers)

00:14:37.343 --> 00:14:40.013
(grunts weakly)

00:14:42.182 --> 00:14:44.350
(shrieks)

00:14:46.219 --> 00:14:47.353
Kabuterimon!

00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:53.927
I'm absolutely useless!
There's nothing that I can do!

00:14:55.762 --> 00:14:56.930
[Kabuterimon] Izzy.

00:14:59.899 --> 00:15:02.202
You're wrong about that.

00:15:02.235 --> 00:15:05.538
You still have something left.

00:15:06.706 --> 00:15:08.675
The ultimate weapon.

00:15:08.708 --> 00:15:12.445
That's even more powerful
than any computer!

00:15:14.447 --> 00:15:18.418
You know what I'm talking
about, don't you, Izzy?

00:15:18.451 --> 00:15:20.453
I mean your brain!

00:15:21.721 --> 00:15:24.090
All that knowledge
you have in there!

00:15:24.123 --> 00:15:26.025
It's you, Izzy!

00:15:26.059 --> 00:15:28.061
(gasps)

00:15:31.297 --> 00:15:32.599
(grunts)

00:15:32.632 --> 00:15:34.767
(mid-tempo action music)

00:15:34.801 --> 00:15:35.768
(gasps)

00:15:35.802 --> 00:15:37.036
Kabuterimon!

00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:39.606
Aim for that crack up
there on the right side!

00:15:39.639 --> 00:15:40.607
All right!

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:42.208
(energy whirs)

00:15:42.242 --> 00:15:44.310
(grunts)

00:15:54.587 --> 00:15:56.756
(shrieks)

00:16:02.462 --> 00:16:03.796
I think you dropped this.

00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:05.265
Wow, thank you!

00:16:06.432 --> 00:16:09.802
I guess I was just so
desperate to be the one

00:16:09.836 --> 00:16:12.572
that helped everyone
out all the time.

00:16:12.605 --> 00:16:14.607
It just became
second nature for me.

00:16:14.641 --> 00:16:17.477
To always rely on this
to decide what to do.

00:16:18.978 --> 00:16:20.647
I forgot that I was the person

00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:22.282
sitting in front
of the computer.

00:16:22.315 --> 00:16:24.150
That it was only
a tool I was using

00:16:24.183 --> 00:16:26.286
to help me figure out solutions.

00:16:26.319 --> 00:16:28.855
At least, until you
reminded me, Kabuterimon.

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:33.760
Even machines have days
when they don't feel well,

00:16:33.793 --> 00:16:35.261
just like people do.

00:16:35.295 --> 00:16:36.429
When that happens,

00:16:36.462 --> 00:16:38.598
you merely have to
reassess your abilities

00:16:38.631 --> 00:16:40.800
and overcome the
obstacles in front of you!

00:16:44.704 --> 00:16:47.840
Now, given the agility of
Greymon and everyone else,

00:16:47.874 --> 00:16:50.977
and factoring in the
Kuwagamon's attack pattern...

00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:52.245
I got it!

00:16:52.278 --> 00:16:54.948
We need to go search the area
around where we got separated.

00:16:54.981 --> 00:16:57.116
And make sure that we
focus on any narrow paths

00:16:57.150 --> 00:16:58.318
and dead ends!

00:16:58.351 --> 00:17:00.019
Yes! Nice job, Izzy!

00:17:00.053 --> 00:17:02.622
Crank that brain of
yours up to full speed!

00:17:02.655 --> 00:17:05.525
I'm totally picking up
what you're putting down!

00:17:08.061 --> 00:17:10.830
(Digivice beeps)

00:17:12.365 --> 00:17:13.533
Kabuterimon...

00:17:14.534 --> 00:17:15.868
Digivolve to...

00:17:17.036 --> 00:17:20.239
(upscale action music)

00:17:23.843 --> 00:17:25.845
(gasps)

00:17:29.415 --> 00:17:32.151
(groans)

00:17:32.185 --> 00:17:34.220
(grunts)

00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:39.392
Oh, no! Togemon!

00:17:40.693 --> 00:17:43.396
(grunts)

00:17:43.429 --> 00:17:45.398
What? No way!

00:17:45.431 --> 00:17:46.733
Whoa!

00:17:46.766 --> 00:17:49.836
Yeah, I'm pretty
psyched about it, too!

00:17:49.869 --> 00:17:54.507
Hey, guys! MegaKabuterimon,
here. At your service!

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:57.010
How's everyone doing?
Are you all right?!

00:17:57.043 --> 00:18:00.079
Hey, Izzy! Kabuterimon
digivolved to...

00:18:01.614 --> 00:18:03.716
(grunts)

00:18:06.119 --> 00:18:08.121
(roars)

00:18:09.956 --> 00:18:11.591
[Izzy] Oukuwamon!

00:18:11.624 --> 00:18:12.892
All right!

00:18:12.925 --> 00:18:15.061
What do you say we
take this outside?

00:18:16.596 --> 00:18:17.271
Hmm!

00:18:25.063 --> 00:18:26.330
[Togemon] I don't think so!

00:18:26.364 --> 00:18:27.899
Get 'em, Togemon!

00:18:29.901 --> 00:18:31.536
(grunts)

00:18:31.569 --> 00:18:33.705
Hey, Tai! Mimi! Listen up!

00:18:33.738 --> 00:18:35.306
Remember those mirror rocks?

00:18:35.339 --> 00:18:37.875
I need you to use them
against these guys!

00:18:37.909 --> 00:18:40.712
Confuse them by getting them
to focus on our reflections!

00:18:40.745 --> 00:18:43.815
I think doing that that oughta
break their coordination!

00:18:43.848 --> 00:18:45.316
If you guys go left, right,

00:18:45.349 --> 00:18:47.318
then left from where
you are right now,

00:18:47.351 --> 00:18:48.820
you should get to that place

00:18:48.853 --> 00:18:50.988
that's full of the mirror
rocks we found earlier!

00:18:51.022 --> 00:18:52.190
Kay, got it! Togemon!

00:18:52.223 --> 00:18:53.558
(grunts excitedly)

00:18:53.591 --> 00:18:55.059
Hey, come here!

00:18:56.427 --> 00:18:58.429
(pants)

00:19:00.531 --> 00:19:01.666
(grunts)

00:19:01.699 --> 00:19:04.368
(both struggle)

00:19:06.437 --> 00:19:08.539
Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!

00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:11.709
(screams)

00:19:14.278 --> 00:19:16.581
Ha! Just kidding! Oh, Togemon!

00:19:16.614 --> 00:19:17.582
(shouts)

00:19:17.615 --> 00:19:18.716
Needle Spray!

00:19:22.887 --> 00:19:25.590
[Greymon] The Kuwagamon
are getting confused!

00:19:25.623 --> 00:19:28.693
It's just like Izzy predicted!

00:19:28.726 --> 00:19:31.462
(Digivice beeps)

00:19:38.402 --> 00:19:40.471
Greymon digivolve to...

00:19:43.074 --> 00:19:45.076
(roars)

00:19:58.122 --> 00:19:59.290
Metal Greymon!

00:20:04.962 --> 00:20:05.963
Giga Storm!

00:20:09.934 --> 00:20:12.904
(both struggle)

00:20:12.937 --> 00:20:14.005
So, Izzy?

00:20:14.038 --> 00:20:17.308
Does this plan of yours
have a part of us to play?

00:20:17.341 --> 00:20:19.243
Yeah, of course!

00:20:19.277 --> 00:20:22.246
I suggest a head-on battle
with all the power you have!

00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:24.482
Go, MegaKabuterimon!

00:20:24.515 --> 00:20:26.250
All right!

00:20:26.284 --> 00:20:28.586
(grunts)

00:20:28.619 --> 00:20:30.021
Good! Good! Good!

00:20:35.493 --> 00:20:37.161
Let's see how you like the taste

00:20:37.195 --> 00:20:39.664
of my fresh, new digivolution!

00:20:42.166 --> 00:20:43.167
Horn...

00:20:49.373 --> 00:20:50.374
Buster!

00:21:04.856 --> 00:21:06.991
[Both] Yeah! All right!

00:21:15.333 --> 00:21:16.334
Good!

00:21:17.335 --> 00:21:18.302
(both chuckle)

00:21:18.336 --> 00:21:19.871
I knew that he'd
pull it off somehow!

00:21:19.904 --> 00:21:21.372
Isn't Izzy's awesome?

00:21:21.405 --> 00:21:24.075
Like they say, a friend in
need is a friend indeed!

00:21:26.744 --> 00:21:27.879
Yeah!

00:21:27.912 --> 00:21:29.347
Uh-huh! Good! Good!

00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:30.348
(computer beeps)

00:21:30.381 --> 00:21:31.382
Huh?

00:21:33.017 --> 00:21:34.652
Hey, look! It's working!

00:21:34.685 --> 00:21:35.653
Whoa, really?!

00:21:35.686 --> 00:21:37.054
Things are looking up!

00:21:37.088 --> 00:21:38.356
(chuckles)

00:21:38.389 --> 00:21:39.357
Huh?

00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:40.725
What's wrong?

00:21:40.758 --> 00:21:43.361
It actually seems to
be even faster now!

00:21:43.394 --> 00:21:46.230
Mm-hmm! Very good, very good!

00:21:46.264 --> 00:21:47.231
(all giggle)

00:21:47.265 --> 00:21:48.532
[Mimi] That's my little helper!

00:21:49.567 --> 00:21:51.002
(snores)

00:21:51.035 --> 00:21:52.103
He fell asleep.

00:21:53.404 --> 00:21:54.572
[Biyomon] He
must've gotten tired

00:21:54.605 --> 00:21:56.841
from talking at
Matt for so long.

00:21:56.874 --> 00:21:58.743
[Ikkaumon] Let's just
let him sleep for now.

00:21:58.776 --> 00:21:59.744
[Sora] Yeah.

00:21:59.777 --> 00:22:00.878
Hey, it's finally quiet.

00:22:03.214 --> 00:22:05.516
[Matt] Let's hop on for a while.

00:22:05.549 --> 00:22:07.118
