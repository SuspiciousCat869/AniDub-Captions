[Narrator] The evil hand
of Devimon reached out

00:01:43.757 --> 00:01:45.425
for Matt's brother, TK.

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.698
Amid the fierce
battle that ensued

00:01:51.732 --> 00:01:55.536
Tai and the others witnessed
the Celestial Digimon's powers.

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.009
After the briefest of encounters

00:02:02.042 --> 00:02:05.913
the Celestial Digimon
transformed into a digi-egg.

00:02:05.946 --> 00:02:08.081
But then, just when they
thought it would fall

00:02:08.115 --> 00:02:09.216
into TKs hands.

00:02:24.097 --> 00:02:25.098
(Agumon growling)

00:02:29.403 --> 00:02:30.771
So who are you?

00:02:30.804 --> 00:02:32.940
And what are you gonna
do with the digi-egg?

00:02:32.973 --> 00:02:35.976
(threatening music)

00:02:37.811 --> 00:02:40.747
(ground crumbling)

00:02:42.749 --> 00:02:44.651
That was a close
one! Am I right?

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:54.294
(wind gusting)

00:02:54.328 --> 00:02:57.598
(collective screaming)

00:03:00.467 --> 00:03:04.004
(Darkmaildramon whinnying)

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:07.908
What was that? Another
one of Devimon's henchmen?

00:03:07.941 --> 00:03:10.143
Yeah. That's what
our reports tell us.

00:03:10.177 --> 00:03:12.746
Skullknightmon.
Aside from the name,

00:03:12.779 --> 00:03:14.481
we don't know much
else about it.

00:03:15.782 --> 00:03:16.783
Gabumon!

00:03:17.784 --> 00:03:20.087
[Gabumon] Gabumon
digivolve to...!

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.121
Garurumon!

00:03:23.457 --> 00:03:26.026
We're gonna follow that
Skullknightmon guy.

00:03:27.194 --> 00:03:29.763
We'll catch up after
we regroup with Leomon.

00:03:29.796 --> 00:03:32.332
In the meantime, good luck.

00:03:32.366 --> 00:03:35.302
(thunder crashing)

00:03:42.042 --> 00:03:44.544
(wind blowing)

00:03:48.148 --> 00:03:49.983
[Tai] This looks just
like that dark swamp

00:03:50.017 --> 00:03:52.119
we saw before, doesn't it?

00:03:52.152 --> 00:03:54.021
Yeah, but this swamp
looks even darker

00:03:54.054 --> 00:03:55.722
and gloopier than the other one.

00:03:57.057 --> 00:03:58.825
Oh Matt, I was wondering

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:00.894
I'm sure you've got
a lot of questions.

00:04:01.828 --> 00:04:03.330
Don't worry. We'll talk later.

00:04:10.337 --> 00:04:12.339
[Gururumon] A tower.

00:04:12.372 --> 00:04:15.208
[Agumon] Look! Skullknightmon!

00:04:15.242 --> 00:04:16.877
He's going inside!

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:20.514
Looks like we're too late.

00:04:26.053 --> 00:04:29.423
Careful, Agumon. I don't
like the look of this place.

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.363
Yeah. The miasma's
way more dense here.

00:04:38.565 --> 00:04:40.167
TK!

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.201
What is it?

00:04:42.202 --> 00:04:44.538
Look what I just
found lying here.

00:04:45.872 --> 00:04:48.275
[Matt] One of the celestial
Digimon's feathers.

00:04:50.911 --> 00:04:53.914
The celestial Digi
on escaped from here

00:04:53.947 --> 00:04:55.415
in order to save us.

00:04:58.285 --> 00:04:59.720
[Tai] This must be the location

00:04:59.753 --> 00:05:01.788
Ogremon told us
was straight ahead.

00:05:05.625 --> 00:05:07.594
This is our destination.

00:05:07.627 --> 00:05:09.563
[Tai] The place we've
been looking for.

00:05:11.465 --> 00:05:12.432
[Agumon] Okay. But,

00:05:12.466 --> 00:05:14.801
how are we going
to get up there?

00:05:17.237 --> 00:05:19.906
(bats flapping)

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:29.483
(energy exploding)

00:05:31.251 --> 00:05:34.254
(miasma bubbling)

00:05:34.287 --> 00:05:36.990
(menacing music)

00:05:46.433 --> 00:05:49.936
[Tai] The miasma...its
become a Digimon!

00:05:55.842 --> 00:05:57.410
(miasma rushing)

00:05:57.444 --> 00:05:59.312
[Gururumon] Howling Blaster!

00:05:59.346 --> 00:06:01.114
(energy exploding)

00:06:01.148 --> 00:06:02.582
(miasma sizzles)

00:06:02.616 --> 00:06:05.519
(Gururumon grunts)

00:06:07.821 --> 00:06:08.822
Watch out!

00:06:10.123 --> 00:06:11.658
(miasma sizzles)

00:06:11.691 --> 00:06:12.692
Agumon!

00:06:14.461 --> 00:06:17.297
[Agumon] Agumon digivolve to...!

00:06:18.365 --> 00:06:19.366
Greymon!

00:06:23.537 --> 00:06:27.040
(energy blasts exploding)

00:06:31.178 --> 00:06:34.014
(miasma swirling)

00:06:44.658 --> 00:06:48.028
(energy blast exploding)

00:06:52.532 --> 00:06:55.468
(Splashmon roaring)

00:06:55.502 --> 00:06:56.670
Stay right here.

00:07:15.255 --> 00:07:18.992
(energy blast exploding)

00:07:19.025 --> 00:07:21.695
(metal hissing)

00:07:22.762 --> 00:07:26.266
(Weregururumon screaming)

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:31.605
Weregururumon!

00:07:35.876 --> 00:07:38.545
(Claw clanging)

00:07:40.447 --> 00:07:44.417
[Tai] So the swamp itself
is the power source!

00:07:46.887 --> 00:07:49.890
(suspenseful music)

00:07:56.463 --> 00:07:57.430
(TK gasps)

00:07:57.464 --> 00:08:00.300
(ground rumbling)

00:08:05.805 --> 00:08:08.808

(birds chirping)

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.402
(doorbell rings)

00:08:44.436 --> 00:08:46.638
Oh good! Sounds like
my ride is here!

00:08:47.606 --> 00:08:49.774
Mimi, why don't you stay at home

00:08:49.808 --> 00:08:51.810
and take it easy
for a little while?

00:08:51.843 --> 00:08:54.779
[Mimi] I did! I had a warm bath

00:08:54.813 --> 00:08:59.417
and a comfy bed to sleep in
and even a big tasty breakfast!

00:08:59.451 --> 00:09:02.087
Mhm. That's called normal life.

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:03.622
[Mimi] I know, I know!

00:09:03.655 --> 00:09:06.124
But my services are
required elsewhere!

00:09:06.157 --> 00:09:08.360
And I've gotta get
moving! Toodles!

00:09:14.532 --> 00:09:17.836
(door opening and closing)

00:09:17.869 --> 00:09:19.671
(Joe groans)

00:09:19.704 --> 00:09:23.341
[Joe's Brother] Mom
was pretty mad, huh?

00:09:23.375 --> 00:09:24.643
[Joe] Yeah.

00:09:25.644 --> 00:09:28.179
You were gone three days,
skipped cram school,

00:09:28.213 --> 00:09:31.116
and lost your study book.

00:09:31.149 --> 00:09:33.785
Can't believe you
really did all that.

00:09:33.818 --> 00:09:35.954
[Joe] It's only cause
there's something else

00:09:35.987 --> 00:09:37.155
I have to do.

00:09:37.188 --> 00:09:38.156
[Joe's Brother] Here.

00:09:38.189 --> 00:09:39.157
[Joe gasping]

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:40.525
It's a runaway bag.

00:09:40.558 --> 00:09:41.526
Huh?

00:09:41.559 --> 00:09:43.461
Look, I dunno what's goin' on...

00:09:43.495 --> 00:09:46.531
(Joe gasping)

00:09:46.564 --> 00:09:48.466
But you gotta do
what you gotta do,

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:49.534
right little brother?

00:09:50.502 --> 00:09:51.503
Uh huh!

00:09:54.205 --> 00:09:57.075
(Digivice beeping)

00:09:59.844 --> 00:10:01.846
Sounds like they're
both on their way here!

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:04.883
Alright. Here Sora,
take a look at this!

00:10:08.053 --> 00:10:10.488
Sora! Are you able to see me?

00:10:10.522 --> 00:10:12.891
Wow, that's amazing!
How'd you do it?

00:10:12.924 --> 00:10:14.559
[Izzy] I updated the Digivice!

00:10:16.194 --> 00:10:18.396
You're limited to communicating
only with your partner,

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:19.831
but still, at least
now you can...

00:10:19.864 --> 00:10:21.433
Izzy! Mayday! Mayday!

00:10:22.434 --> 00:10:24.869
We've got big trouble over here!

00:10:24.903 --> 00:10:27.539
(Intense music)

00:10:32.911 --> 00:10:36.014
[Palmon] So creepy!
And so many of them!

00:10:36.047 --> 00:10:38.450
[Gomamon] No wonder
communications were jammed!

00:10:47.058 --> 00:10:49.894
(Calmaramon sings)

00:11:01.106 --> 00:11:03.041
[Tentomon] What
is going on here?

00:11:03.074 --> 00:11:04.442
[Izzy] That one in the center

00:11:04.476 --> 00:11:06.611
is controlling the
surrounding Digimon!

00:11:07.445 --> 00:11:09.614
That Digimon's name is...

00:11:09.647 --> 00:11:11.082
Cal..ma..ra..mon?

00:11:14.085 --> 00:11:15.420
It's Calmaramon!

00:11:29.667 --> 00:11:33.138
What system could
they be targeting?

00:11:33.171 --> 00:11:36.808
The Strait of
Malacca? Oh no! Look!

00:11:40.345 --> 00:11:42.680
(Izzy gasps)

00:11:45.183 --> 00:11:48.153
[Crewman] We've lost
steering! I can't control it!

00:11:48.186 --> 00:11:50.855
Override the system
and switch to manual!

00:11:51.689 --> 00:11:52.991
[Crewman] It's no use!

00:11:53.024 --> 00:11:54.926
It's not responding
to any of my commands!

00:11:54.959 --> 00:11:56.995
[Captain] What? If we
stay on this course,

00:11:57.028 --> 00:11:58.963
we'll crash straight
into the harbor!

00:12:00.131 --> 00:12:02.667
There's a system that
big ships like this use

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:05.637
to keep in communication
with the port authorities.

00:12:06.638 --> 00:12:08.840
They broke into the
system by using that data!

00:12:09.874 --> 00:12:11.843
[Sora] Can we stop it?

00:12:11.876 --> 00:12:13.678
[Izzy] The only
way is by defeating

00:12:13.711 --> 00:12:16.514
those Digimon as
quickly as we can!

00:12:16.548 --> 00:12:19.551
(Boat horn blaring)

00:12:31.996 --> 00:12:34.999
(pebbles crumbling)

00:12:43.007 --> 00:12:45.543
(TK screaming)

00:13:01.259 --> 00:13:04.529
(Intense battle music)

00:13:11.369 --> 00:13:14.539
(Weregarurumon grunting)

00:13:14.572 --> 00:13:17.942
(Metalgreymon screaming)

00:13:40.965 --> 00:13:42.734
Now do it, Metalgreymon!

00:13:42.767 --> 00:13:45.637
(rockets blasting)

00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:53.411
Wolf Claw!

00:13:54.746 --> 00:13:56.981
Giga Blaster!

00:13:59.751 --> 00:14:00.752
Come on.

00:14:03.922 --> 00:14:05.123
(blasts exploding)

00:14:05.156 --> 00:14:06.324
What the...!

00:14:14.465 --> 00:14:15.466
Gabumon!

00:14:43.127 --> 00:14:45.163
[Tai] Metalgreymon, no!

00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:54.639
How do I stop this thing?

00:15:05.383 --> 00:15:05.975
[TK] Huh?

00:15:11.956 --> 00:15:13.024
What is that?

00:15:14.292 --> 00:15:17.128
(cavern rumbling)

00:15:34.979 --> 00:15:35.980
[TK] Whoa...

00:15:49.494 --> 00:15:52.730
(electricity crackling)

00:16:17.722 --> 00:16:19.023
Metalgreymon.

00:16:19.924 --> 00:16:20.925
Tai wait.

00:16:25.396 --> 00:16:28.232
(miasma sizzling)

00:16:29.434 --> 00:16:32.036
(Tai grunting)

00:16:40.411 --> 00:16:41.412
Tai...

00:16:42.547 --> 00:16:45.216
(Tai screaming)

00:16:47.285 --> 00:16:48.553
Come on, Tai.

00:16:50.288 --> 00:16:52.957
(crashing metal)

00:16:57.228 --> 00:16:59.597
To take back the
Celestial Digimon

00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:02.533
and to save our world as well.

00:17:02.567 --> 00:17:04.569
That's why we came
all the way here!

00:17:08.406 --> 00:17:10.274
And that's why we're
not gonna give up!

00:17:10.308 --> 00:17:12.944
Not now or ever!

00:17:12.977 --> 00:17:14.078
[Tai] Right, Metalgreymon?

00:17:17.782 --> 00:17:21.786
(Metalgreymon's body crackling)

00:17:23.955 --> 00:17:26.624
(Tai screaming)

00:17:29.327 --> 00:17:32.497
(Powerful rock music)

00:17:43.608 --> 00:17:46.611
(Splashmon roaring)

00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:55.153
(singing in Japanese)

00:17:57.622 --> 00:18:00.124
[Tai] Metalgreymon overcame
the miasma's poison

00:18:00.158 --> 00:18:02.660
and turned it into a new power!

00:18:14.805 --> 00:18:18.142
(electricity crackling)

00:18:24.382 --> 00:18:26.517
Blow it out of the sky!

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:45.570
(Splashmon exploding)

00:18:51.842 --> 00:18:53.511
I've gotcha, Agumon!

00:18:56.247 --> 00:18:57.481
We did it!

00:18:57.515 --> 00:18:59.550
Yeah, we did.

00:18:59.584 --> 00:19:02.420
(ground rumbling)

00:19:04.889 --> 00:19:06.924
[Tai] Uh..What is that?

00:19:09.026 --> 00:19:10.361
Matt, up here!

00:19:11.062 --> 00:19:12.029
(TK screaming)

00:19:12.063 --> 00:19:13.064
TK!

00:19:14.699 --> 00:19:15.833
Are you alright?

00:19:15.866 --> 00:19:16.867
[TK] Mhm!

00:19:17.602 --> 00:19:18.703
Whoa, look!

00:19:19.570 --> 00:19:22.373
(majestic music)

00:19:25.042 --> 00:19:27.612
(earth quakes)

00:19:41.959 --> 00:19:45.062
(collective gasping)

00:20:03.481 --> 00:20:05.883
So that's how we
get into the castle.

00:20:05.916 --> 00:20:08.219
Wow, TK, you did
all this yourself?

00:20:08.252 --> 00:20:09.253
Mhm!

00:20:11.822 --> 00:20:13.324
Nice job, little brother!

00:20:16.961 --> 00:20:18.062
Alright!

00:20:18.095 --> 00:20:19.096
[Tai] Let's go!

00:20:21.932 --> 00:20:23.334
Spiral Twister!

00:20:25.836 --> 00:20:28.973
(Calamaramon singing)

00:20:32.143 --> 00:20:33.644
There's too many of them!

00:20:33.678 --> 00:20:37.081
Forget about them! It's that
Calamaramon we have to stop!

00:20:37.114 --> 00:20:38.316
Alright!

00:20:38.349 --> 00:20:41.018
(Palmon yelling)

00:20:42.453 --> 00:20:43.454
Okay!

00:20:44.188 --> 00:20:46.991
(Gomamon gasping)

00:20:47.958 --> 00:20:49.760
A digivolution!

00:20:49.794 --> 00:20:50.761
(Izzy gasps)

00:20:50.795 --> 00:20:51.996
Could that be?

00:20:53.464 --> 00:20:56.267
I knew it! The
Digimon from before!

00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:57.635
Argamon!

00:20:57.668 --> 00:20:59.136
You've seen those things?

00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:00.671
Oh yeah!

00:21:00.705 --> 00:21:05.109
[Izzy] The more they evolve,
the more dangerous they get.

00:21:05.142 --> 00:21:09.447
Unbelievable. Calmaramon's
controlling them?

00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:10.948
Don't tell me...

00:21:10.981 --> 00:21:13.718
they're trying to crash
that tanker into the city!

00:21:14.151 --> 00:21:19.156
(dramatic music)

00:21:41.545 --> 00:21:42.513

[Izzy] The Digimon Encyclopedia!

00:22:45.075 --> 00:22:47.445
Metalgreymon! Greymon digivolves

00:22:47.478 --> 00:22:50.948
into this Ultimate Digimon and
his super destructive attack

00:22:50.981 --> 00:22:53.951
can be launched from
Metalgreymon's iron body!

00:22:53.984 --> 00:22:55.619
Now let's check this out!

00:22:55.653 --> 00:22:57.421
Metalgreymon's
right arm is bare,

00:22:57.455 --> 00:22:59.123
which you'd think
might be a mistake,

00:22:59.156 --> 00:23:00.458
but there's a good reason.

00:23:00.491 --> 00:23:03.427
It's kept bare so he can
make this awesome move!

00:23:03.461 --> 00:23:05.596
Maybe Kabuterimon's
hiding something, too.

00:23:08.599 --> 00:23:10.935
Which Digimon will
it be next time?

00:23:12.503 --> 00:23:14.572
[Narrator] TK and
Matt are in danger!

00:23:14.605 --> 00:23:18.943
That's when Weregururumon's
roar echoes through the sky!

00:23:18.976 --> 00:23:20.811
[Tai] Next time on
Digimon Adventure:

00:23:20.845 --> 00:23:23.080
The Unbeatable Blue Sagittarius.

00:23:23.113 --> 00:23:25.683
[Narrator] The adventure
continues in a new world.
