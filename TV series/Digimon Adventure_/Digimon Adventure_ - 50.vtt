00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:12.741
Agumon. Are you okay?

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:15.177
[Agumon] I'm all right.

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.147
Don't worry about me.
I can still fight.

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.248
[Tai] Yeah?

00:02:19.281 --> 00:02:22.751
Glad to hear it, buddy.
Let's show 'em who's boss!

00:02:25.587 --> 00:02:27.689
Agumon Digivolve too...

00:02:36.698 --> 00:02:38.600

Took you long enough.

00:02:52.214 --> 00:02:53.782
Good luck, big bro.

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:03.392
[Narrator] Millenniummon
was darkness reborn.

00:03:04.226 --> 00:03:05.594
The gargantuan beast

00:03:05.627 --> 00:03:08.096
had swallowed the
Digi-Destined whole.

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.601
It seemed the world
would fall into despair.

00:03:12.634 --> 00:03:17.639
However, in spite of everything,
the battle wasn't over yet.

00:03:18.106 --> 00:03:19.908
(growls)

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:28.617
[Lopmon] Millenniummon's
very existence

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.887
is a corruption of
the Digital World.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.790
If we don't stop him,
this world will fade away.

00:03:34.823 --> 00:03:36.892
Taking every one of us with it.

00:03:36.925 --> 00:03:38.594
[Leomon] And our friends?

00:03:38.627 --> 00:03:41.730
The Digi-Destined have to be
somewhere out there, right?

00:03:41.763 --> 00:03:43.632
I don't know.

00:03:43.665 --> 00:03:46.435
Where are you,
Celestial Digimon?

00:03:46.468 --> 00:03:50.305
I fear for the battle
ahead. You must wake up!

00:03:51.773 --> 00:03:53.141
(grunts)

00:03:53.175 --> 00:03:56.311
[TK] Wake up guys.
We're still alive!

00:03:56.345 --> 00:03:57.346
TK?

00:03:58.347 --> 00:04:01.250
My arms are heavy. The
heck is this place?

00:04:01.283 --> 00:04:03.785
[Gatomon] We're
all in danger here.

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:05.921
Millenniummon must be
holding us in a prison

00:04:05.954 --> 00:04:08.423
made of compressed
time and space.

00:04:08.457 --> 00:04:10.592
And if we don't find a way out,

00:04:10.626 --> 00:04:12.761
we'll continue to
sink deeper and deeper

00:04:12.794 --> 00:04:15.964
into the infinite darkness
for all of eternity.

00:04:15.998 --> 00:04:18.433
I feel like that's something
we should try to avoid.

00:04:18.467 --> 00:04:21.436
For sure, but that's no
reason to give up just yet!

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.339
We all saw that light,
right? We've got this!

00:04:24.373 --> 00:04:27.309
Of course! Who else could it be?

00:04:27.342 --> 00:04:28.777
WarGreymon.

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.346
As long as Tai's kicking
we still have a chance!

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:32.681
-(energy crackles)
-(Kari screams)

00:04:32.714 --> 00:04:35.817
(all scream)

00:04:35.851 --> 00:04:38.520
(ominous music)

00:04:41.323 --> 00:04:44.326
That's him? He's even
bigger than I imagined!

00:04:44.359 --> 00:04:46.328
Total world-ender.

00:04:46.361 --> 00:04:47.329
(gasps)

00:04:47.362 --> 00:04:49.364
[WarGreymon] Tai, look!

00:04:49.398 --> 00:04:52.534
[Tai] Right. Everyone's
stuck inside that weird orb!

00:04:52.567 --> 00:04:55.304
We've gotta stop Millenniummon
before he crushes them!

00:04:55.337 --> 00:04:58.907
[WarGreymon] Let's
not keep them waiting!

00:05:06.348 --> 00:05:11.019
Try to hold on, everybody.
I'm not leaving you behind!

00:05:12.688 --> 00:05:13.722
(energy whirs)

00:05:13.755 --> 00:05:15.757
(gasps)

00:05:19.761 --> 00:05:22.764
(WarGreymon grunts)

00:05:28.203 --> 00:05:30.205
(gasps)

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:35.010
(loud explosions)

00:05:35.043 --> 00:05:37.746
(dramatic music)

00:05:39.247 --> 00:05:42.084
(Digimon cry out)

00:05:48.123 --> 00:05:49.758
(gasps)

00:05:49.791 --> 00:05:53.128
(Millenniummon growls)

00:06:00.135 --> 00:06:01.737
This is beyond bad news!

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:04.539
If we don't do something
quick, we're done.

00:06:04.573 --> 00:06:07.943
It'll be the end of
the Digital World!

00:06:07.976 --> 00:06:10.545
(orb cracks)

00:06:10.579 --> 00:06:11.580
(grunts)

00:06:11.613 --> 00:06:12.581
The pressure!

00:06:12.614 --> 00:06:14.282
It's like I'm being
crushed to bits!

00:06:14.316 --> 00:06:16.284
(all scream)

00:06:16.318 --> 00:06:18.220
The data in this
dimension's getting denser

00:06:18.253 --> 00:06:20.422
with every passing second!

00:06:21.456 --> 00:06:22.791
So heavy!

00:06:22.824 --> 00:06:23.792
(grunts)

00:06:23.825 --> 00:06:25.560
It's too much!

00:06:25.594 --> 00:06:28.964
We have to keep believing
in Tai! C'mon, Gabumon!

00:06:28.997 --> 00:06:29.998
Yeah!

00:06:31.166 --> 00:06:33.168
(roars)

00:06:41.977 --> 00:06:43.345
MetalGarurumon!

00:06:46.348 --> 00:06:48.150
(Matt cries out)

00:06:48.183 --> 00:06:49.618
Metal Wolf Claw!

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:58.493
[Mimi] Did we break
through something just now?

00:06:58.527 --> 00:07:00.595
[Izzy] The rate of
compression slowed down?

00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:01.997
Eureka!

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:04.666
The more data one produces, the
longer it takes to compress!

00:07:04.699 --> 00:07:05.767
That makes sense!

00:07:05.801 --> 00:07:07.002
We can buy some time!

00:07:07.035 --> 00:07:09.004
Let's snatch up
as much as we can!

00:07:09.037 --> 00:07:11.440
(Digivices whir)

00:07:11.473 --> 00:07:13.775
As long as Tai's
giving it his best.

00:07:13.809 --> 00:07:17.479
Then we better give it
everything we've got!

00:07:19.214 --> 00:07:21.783
Everyone's putting
themselves on the line.

00:07:21.817 --> 00:07:25.187
If they're stepping
up then I will too!

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:26.822
(grunts)

00:07:26.855 --> 00:07:28.190
Hey, where're you going?

00:07:28.223 --> 00:07:29.357
Patamon?

00:07:29.391 --> 00:07:30.625
[Gatomon] We won't back down!

00:07:30.659 --> 00:07:31.693
[Patomon] Because we are...

00:07:31.726 --> 00:07:33.462
[Both] The Celestial Digimon!

00:07:33.495 --> 00:07:34.463
(both gasp)

00:07:34.496 --> 00:07:36.131
Leading the charge headfirst!

00:07:36.164 --> 00:07:38.967
Fending off darkness and
leaving no one behind!

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.472
Together we'll fight back
against evil till the very end!

00:07:43.505 --> 00:07:50.470
(Digivices whir)

00:07:58.311 --> 00:08:01.348
(tense action music)

00:08:12.526 --> 00:08:13.577
(ground rumbles)

00:08:16.788 --> 00:08:19.458
(Tai cries out)

00:08:19.491 --> 00:08:20.926
Just a bit further!

00:08:20.959 --> 00:08:21.960
(gasps)

00:08:21.993 --> 00:08:24.496
(Tai screams)

00:08:32.337 --> 00:08:35.340
Dang it! This guy moves so fast!

00:08:35.373 --> 00:08:37.175
Watch out!

00:08:37.209 --> 00:08:39.811
(energy whirs)

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:47.853
(grunts)

00:08:47.886 --> 00:08:50.021
(growls)

00:08:50.856 --> 00:08:53.191
(all grunt)

00:08:54.159 --> 00:08:56.628
Not looking good. Come on, Tai!

00:08:56.661 --> 00:08:57.829
[Both] Keep going!

00:08:57.863 --> 00:08:59.197
[Both] Please, Tai!

00:08:59.231 --> 00:09:00.198
It's up to you!

00:09:00.232 --> 00:09:01.566
Hang in there!

00:09:04.503 --> 00:09:07.672
(growls triumphantly)

00:09:10.542 --> 00:09:13.378
[Matt] Don't stop
fighting, no matter what!

00:09:13.411 --> 00:09:15.547
We believe in you!

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:17.015
[Both] Keep going!

00:09:17.048 --> 00:09:18.483
[Both] Please, Tai!

00:09:18.517 --> 00:09:19.985
[TK] It's up to you!

00:09:20.018 --> 00:09:21.920
[Kari] Hang in there!

00:09:23.588 --> 00:09:26.258
[Digi-Destined] Never give up!

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:30.695
(upscale action music)

00:09:30.729 --> 00:09:33.532
What is this? The hope
of the Digi-Destined?

00:09:33.565 --> 00:09:37.168
It's manifested into something
brilliant and amazing!

00:09:37.202 --> 00:09:38.203
Such power!

00:09:41.907 --> 00:09:45.076
(singing in Japanese)

00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:00.125
Brave Shield!

00:10:08.733 --> 00:10:09.901
Great Tornado!

00:10:15.574 --> 00:10:18.143
(both cry out)

00:10:36.094 --> 00:10:38.496
MagnaAngemon digivolve to...

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:44.502
Angewomon digivolve to...

00:10:56.781 --> 00:10:57.782
Goldramon!

00:11:02.687 --> 00:11:03.855
Magnadramon!

00:11:06.625 --> 00:11:09.761
It's The Light of
Hope! Incredible!

00:11:09.794 --> 00:11:12.864
Prodigious! The Celestial
Digimon's true strength!

00:11:15.133 --> 00:11:16.434
[Sora] With power like that,

00:11:16.468 --> 00:11:19.004
they could save
the entire world!

00:11:19.037 --> 00:11:21.840
(dramatic music)

00:11:31.883 --> 00:11:34.452
(grunts)

00:11:34.486 --> 00:11:35.453
[Sora] Tai!

00:11:35.487 --> 00:11:36.988
You all right?

00:11:37.022 --> 00:11:40.191
Hey, friends! Glad to see
you. Where the heck are we?

00:11:40.225 --> 00:11:41.526
We're in a protective field

00:11:41.559 --> 00:11:43.862
that Magnadramon and Kari made!

00:11:43.895 --> 00:11:44.896
Go Kari.

00:11:46.731 --> 00:11:48.366
-[Matt] Tai?
-Right here!

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:49.367
Oh, thank goodness!

00:11:49.401 --> 00:11:51.302
You had us all
worried for a sec!

00:11:51.336 --> 00:11:54.506
[Matt] Gatomon and
Patomon digivolved.

00:11:54.539 --> 00:11:57.175
Goldramon! MagnaAngemon!

00:11:57.208 --> 00:12:01.046
This is who they are.
The Celestial Digimon!

00:12:02.914 --> 00:12:04.482
Behold.

00:12:04.516 --> 00:12:07.385
All of your convictions took
shape into a beacon of hope.

00:12:07.419 --> 00:12:10.555
The light changed us
into miraculous new forms

00:12:10.588 --> 00:12:12.490
none had ever seen.

00:12:12.524 --> 00:12:14.592
(growls)

00:12:16.227 --> 00:12:18.363
We got this! There's
no turning back!

00:12:18.396 --> 00:12:20.065
It's our turn now!

00:12:21.433 --> 00:12:24.202
(dramatic music)

00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:27.872
(grunts)

00:12:30.575 --> 00:12:32.711
(grunts)

00:12:51.563 --> 00:12:52.597
(roars)

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:55.533
(grunts)

00:12:55.567 --> 00:12:57.635
(growls)

00:13:02.941 --> 00:13:05.310
(both growl)

00:13:07.312 --> 00:13:10.615
(MagnaAngemon grunts)

00:13:10.648 --> 00:13:12.650
(roars)

00:13:17.255 --> 00:13:20.492
(upscale action music)

00:13:27.799 --> 00:13:29.934
(growls)

00:13:37.776 --> 00:13:40.111
So it's finally begun.

00:13:40.145 --> 00:13:42.614
The celestial battle for the
fate of our Digital World

00:13:42.647 --> 00:13:44.582
is truly under way.

00:13:44.616 --> 00:13:47.252
(both pant)

00:13:47.285 --> 00:13:48.920
(gasps)

00:13:48.953 --> 00:13:49.921
(energy whirs)

00:13:49.954 --> 00:13:51.623
(growls)

00:13:51.656 --> 00:13:53.591
Goldramon, now!

00:13:53.625 --> 00:13:55.126
Go, Magnadramon!

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:59.330
(upscale action music)

00:13:59.364 --> 00:14:02.534
Fatal Flame!

00:14:05.003 --> 00:14:07.305
Fire Tornado!

00:14:09.974 --> 00:14:12.043
(growls)

00:14:26.524 --> 00:14:29.027
(lightning crackles)

00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:31.830
Such a fierce show of strength!

00:14:33.164 --> 00:14:35.700
(grunts)

00:14:35.733 --> 00:14:37.836
(grunts)

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:44.409
(energy whirs)

00:14:48.746 --> 00:14:51.149
(growls)

00:14:51.182 --> 00:14:52.317
Is he melting?

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:54.853
That's what happens when
they're hit by that much heat!

00:14:54.886 --> 00:14:57.722
(all grunt)

00:14:57.755 --> 00:14:59.757
(roars)

00:15:00.925 --> 00:15:03.928
Now, Goldramon! It's
our final strike!

00:15:08.032 --> 00:15:11.035
Gold Fist!

00:15:22.046 --> 00:15:25.950
Do it, Magnadramon!
Don't hold anything back!

00:15:27.285 --> 00:15:30.588
May the celestial light banish
you away, Millenniummon!

00:15:30.622 --> 00:15:31.623
Dragon Fire!

00:15:36.227 --> 00:15:38.296
(growls)

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:54.746
(both pant)

00:15:56.748 --> 00:15:57.665
(all gasp)

00:16:10.136 --> 00:16:13.439
(Millenniummon growls)

00:16:22.815 --> 00:16:24.217
(Tai gasps)

00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:26.919
(ominous music)

00:16:28.454 --> 00:16:31.624
(giant Digimon roars)

00:16:37.797 --> 00:16:38.898
What in the...?

00:16:38.931 --> 00:16:40.566
What are they?

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:43.169
[Izzy] I can't find an entry!

00:16:44.337 --> 00:16:47.173
(energy crackles)

00:16:58.618 --> 00:17:02.455
So here we are. And
thus, the end has begun.

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:06.526
(energy crackles)

00:17:08.127 --> 00:17:10.129
(gasps)

00:17:11.998 --> 00:17:13.666
What do we do now?

00:17:20.173 --> 00:17:23.142
(thunder claps)

00:17:23.176 --> 00:17:26.179
(ethereal hum)

00:17:26.212 --> 00:17:30.783
[Mimi] Look! There are
tiny sparkles everywhere!

00:17:30.817 --> 00:17:31.784
(ethereal hum)

00:17:31.818 --> 00:17:33.286
This feeling!

00:17:33.319 --> 00:17:34.520
What is this?

00:17:34.554 --> 00:17:36.489
[Xiaomon] An old friend!

00:17:36.522 --> 00:17:38.358
It's the same light
we saw before.

00:17:38.391 --> 00:17:40.293
The Light of Hope, remember?

00:17:40.326 --> 00:17:42.862
[Lopmon] It's alive.

00:17:42.895 --> 00:17:47.367
The very earth of our
own world. It calls out.

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:48.868
Could it be?

00:17:48.901 --> 00:17:52.138
Is it saying it wishes to fight
alongside the Digi-Destined?

00:17:52.171 --> 00:17:54.741
(energy whirs)

00:17:56.576 --> 00:17:58.177
Now's our chance!

00:17:59.846 --> 00:18:01.714
(singing in Japanese)

00:18:01.748 --> 00:18:04.183
Let's go, WarGreymon!

00:18:04.217 --> 00:18:06.386
Yeah! I'm with you, Tai!

00:18:17.363 --> 00:18:18.364
Terra Force!

00:18:22.435 --> 00:18:24.737
We need more energy!

00:18:24.771 --> 00:18:27.373
(ethereal hum)

00:18:29.776 --> 00:18:31.444
Well, there you go!

00:18:31.878 --> 00:18:33.413
[Leomon] The spirit
to persevere.

00:18:33.446 --> 00:18:35.948
The courage to keep believing.

00:18:39.218 --> 00:18:40.853
That will is the
essence of hope!

00:18:40.887 --> 00:18:42.588
It'll ignite their
full strength!

00:18:42.622 --> 00:18:44.690
So let's pass it on!

00:18:44.724 --> 00:18:46.726
Carry forth the Light of Hope.

00:18:46.759 --> 00:18:49.128
Send it to the Digi-Destined!

00:18:51.564 --> 00:18:55.902
I can feel it surging and
shimmering. It's unreal!

00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:58.271
Here we go!

00:18:59.405 --> 00:19:04.410
[Both] Terra Force!

00:19:13.653 --> 00:19:15.988
(both roar)

00:19:17.256 --> 00:19:20.092
(energy crackles)

00:19:23.663 --> 00:19:25.765
(grunts)

00:19:31.504 --> 00:19:32.905
Hark!

00:19:32.939 --> 00:19:37.076
The reckoning of our long
ancient battle has come at last!

00:19:37.109 --> 00:19:41.447
Yes. We shall entrust you
with our powers as well!

00:19:53.526 --> 00:19:55.995
This light is the fire
we lit in the hearts

00:19:56.028 --> 00:19:59.966
of all the companions we've
befriended on our journey.

00:19:59.999 --> 00:20:03.970
It is the Light of Hope that
you gave to the Digimon.

00:20:04.003 --> 00:20:07.540
Everyone's here. The
whole Digital World!

00:20:15.147 --> 00:20:17.950
(energy whirs)

00:20:17.984 --> 00:20:21.120
It's over, Millenniummon.
You're not coming back.

00:20:21.153 --> 00:20:23.789
Not as long as
we're still around!

00:20:23.823 --> 00:20:26.158
(both roar)

00:20:38.237 --> 00:20:40.840
(upbeat music)

00:20:49.081 --> 00:20:50.917
[Kari] Hey, big bro!

00:20:53.419 --> 00:20:55.054
Hey, sis! Hey, guys!

00:20:55.087 --> 00:20:59.058
Oh, Tai! (sobs) I'm
really glad you're okay!

00:20:59.091 --> 00:21:02.428
You, too, Kari!
Thanks for everything.

00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:07.733
Same to you guys. You cheering
me on is what kept me going.

00:21:07.767 --> 00:21:08.734
(all laugh)

00:21:08.768 --> 00:21:09.769
Huh?

00:21:11.604 --> 00:21:12.905
(both laugh)

00:21:12.939 --> 00:21:14.740
(Agumon yawns)

00:21:14.774 --> 00:21:15.775
Agumon!

00:21:20.913 --> 00:21:23.516

00:21:23.549 --> 00:21:24.684

Let's check out some more facts!

00:22:53.839 --> 00:22:56.008
Is that a beard
growing from his chin?

00:22:56.042 --> 00:22:58.678
It looks classy and
cool at the same time!

00:22:58.711 --> 00:23:01.647
I wonder if he needs a special
razor to groom that thing.

00:23:01.681 --> 00:23:03.849
I'd like to know more
about its morning routine!
