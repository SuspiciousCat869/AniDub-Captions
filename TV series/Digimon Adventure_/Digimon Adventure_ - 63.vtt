[Narrator] Guided by the
power of the eight crests,

00:01:44.165 --> 00:01:47.135
a new chapter of the
Digi-Destined's great adventure

00:01:47.168 --> 00:01:48.169
had begun.

00:01:48.903 --> 00:01:51.339
Who knows what trials
and tribulations

00:01:51.372 --> 00:01:52.373
they'll need to face

00:01:52.406 --> 00:01:55.409
in their fight against
the Great Catastrophe?

00:01:56.878 --> 00:02:00.214
While following the paths
set by their Digivices,

00:02:00.248 --> 00:02:03.050
the team continues to
make heartfelt connections

00:02:03.084 --> 00:02:05.520
with the Digimon they
meet along the way.

00:02:07.221 --> 00:02:10.158
After crossing paths with
all sorts of new friends

00:02:10.191 --> 00:02:12.894
and foes around
the Digital World,

00:02:12.927 --> 00:02:16.364
Tai's amazing journey was
coming closer to its end.

00:02:18.032 --> 00:02:19.367
(bird cawing)

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.570
(footsteps pattering)

00:02:27.375 --> 00:02:28.743
[Tai] What do you know?

00:02:28.776 --> 00:02:30.411
It's a castle.

00:02:30.444 --> 00:02:31.879
Oh and a big one too.

00:02:31.913 --> 00:02:33.581
Think we should take a look?

00:02:33.614 --> 00:02:36.417
Maybe this is where your
Digivice wants you to go.

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.286
Hope you're right
about that, Sora.

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.056
(pensive music)

00:02:44.625 --> 00:02:45.593
(Tai gasping)

00:02:45.626 --> 00:02:46.594
(Digivice beeping)

00:02:46.627 --> 00:02:48.896
Hmm?

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.032
It's name is Knightmon.

00:02:51.065 --> 00:02:52.366
Hello!

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.768
Anybody home?

00:02:55.403 --> 00:02:56.370
Hmm.

00:02:56.404 --> 00:02:58.072
Could you tell us where we are?

00:02:58.105 --> 00:02:59.440
(armor clanging)

00:02:59.473 --> 00:03:01.709

(door clanging)

00:03:13.154 --> 00:03:15.823
It looks pretty dark in there.

00:03:16.991 --> 00:03:20.461
(Digivice beeping)

00:03:20.494 --> 00:03:23.164
So, cool if we go inside?

00:03:26.467 --> 00:03:28.236
[All] Mm-hmm.

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:30.238
(footsteps pattering)

00:03:30.271 --> 00:03:33.441

(air whooshing)

00:03:44.118 --> 00:03:46.988
Either nobody lives here,
or they're all really quiet.

00:03:47.021 --> 00:03:47.989
Seems like a shame

00:03:48.022 --> 00:03:49.790
when there's so much
room in this castle.

00:03:49.824 --> 00:03:50.791
(Valkyrimon cawing)

00:03:50.825 --> 00:03:52.260
What the...

00:03:52.293 --> 00:03:55.263
(Agumon gasping)

00:03:55.296 --> 00:03:56.831
A bird?

00:03:56.864 --> 00:03:58.432
We'd better go check it out.

00:03:58.466 --> 00:03:59.800
(all grunting)

00:03:59.834 --> 00:04:02.336
(all panting)

00:04:03.638 --> 00:04:06.140
(Tai panting)

00:04:08.542 --> 00:04:11.145
(gentle music)

00:04:14.348 --> 00:04:16.017
Hey, Agumon?

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:17.018
Sora?

00:04:17.051 --> 00:04:18.286
Biyomon?

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:20.021
[Valkyrimon] Welcome,
young Digi-Destined.

00:04:20.054 --> 00:04:21.355
Who's there?

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:23.324
(gentle music)

00:04:23.357 --> 00:04:24.792
(Tai gasping)

00:04:24.825 --> 00:04:29.330
So, are you like, in charge
of this place or what?

00:04:29.363 --> 00:04:30.831
I am not.

00:04:30.865 --> 00:04:35.169
Right now you stand in an
empty castle with no master.

00:04:36.003 --> 00:04:37.371
But long ago,

00:04:37.405 --> 00:04:40.207
this was once a gathering
place for warriors

00:04:40.241 --> 00:04:43.144
who protected the order
of the Digital World.

00:04:43.177 --> 00:04:45.646
Together, they set
out to vanquish

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.050
the uncontrollable
forces of darkness.

00:04:49.083 --> 00:04:50.318
[Tai] Wait.

00:04:50.351 --> 00:04:52.019
I've heard about this before.

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.155
Of course.

00:04:54.188 --> 00:04:56.157
You're talking about
the ancient war, right?

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:57.558
[Valkyrimon] Yes.

00:04:57.591 --> 00:05:00.828
I am an entity that perished
in the great conflict.

00:05:00.861 --> 00:05:04.231
However, as it is
my fate to witness

00:05:04.265 --> 00:05:06.701
and chronicle the
lives of warriors,

00:05:06.734 --> 00:05:10.071
I have relocated my soul
into a makeshift body

00:05:10.104 --> 00:05:12.106
to remain within this world.

00:05:13.607 --> 00:05:15.076
We just stumbled
into this place,

00:05:15.109 --> 00:05:17.878
looking for a way to stop
the Great Catastrophe.

00:05:17.912 --> 00:05:19.080
Do you know about it,

00:05:19.113 --> 00:05:20.614
or how we can prevent it?

00:05:22.116 --> 00:05:23.918
You must use the great power.

00:05:25.886 --> 00:05:27.755
[Tai] The great power?

00:05:27.788 --> 00:05:30.291
(Tai gasping)

00:05:32.126 --> 00:05:34.895
We must challenge you first.

00:05:34.929 --> 00:05:36.364
Prove yourself.

00:05:36.397 --> 00:05:38.866
Show us your true colors.

00:05:38.899 --> 00:05:41.302
Your truth is where
the answer lies.

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:43.537
(Tai gasping)

00:05:43.571 --> 00:05:45.773
(Tai grunting)

00:05:45.806 --> 00:05:48.776
(Tai gasping)

00:05:48.809 --> 00:05:49.777
Not impaled.

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:50.811
Sweet!

00:05:54.482 --> 00:05:56.484
Oh, where the heck am I?

00:05:57.752 --> 00:05:58.753
Sora!

00:05:59.487 --> 00:06:02.556
(pensive music)

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:03.591
Hello!

00:06:06.761 --> 00:06:09.964
(Tai gasping)

00:06:09.997 --> 00:06:13.267
(Botamon bouncing)

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:15.803
(Tai gasping)

00:06:16.637 --> 00:06:18.806
(Botamon bouncing)

00:06:18.839 --> 00:06:19.940
(footsteps thudding)

00:06:19.974 --> 00:06:22.309
(Goblimon growling)

00:06:22.343 --> 00:06:24.478
(Goblimon roaring)

00:06:24.512 --> 00:06:27.181
(club thudding)

00:06:28.115 --> 00:06:29.650
He's in trouble!

00:06:29.683 --> 00:06:30.684
Agumon!

00:06:32.153 --> 00:06:33.120
(Tai grunting)

00:06:33.154 --> 00:06:34.455
(footsteps thudding)

00:06:34.488 --> 00:06:36.424
(Goblimon growling)

00:06:36.457 --> 00:06:39.126
(Tai screaming)

00:06:40.027 --> 00:06:41.462
(Tai grunting)

00:06:41.495 --> 00:06:43.964
(tense music)

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:46.200
Gotcha!

00:06:48.035 --> 00:06:49.970
You okay there, buddy?

00:06:50.004 --> 00:06:52.139
(Botamon cooing)

00:06:52.173 --> 00:06:54.508
(footsteps pattering)

00:06:54.542 --> 00:06:57.044
(tense music)

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:03.451
(Botamon shuddering)

00:07:03.484 --> 00:07:04.485
Shh!

00:07:05.519 --> 00:07:08.689
(footsteps pattering)

00:07:11.158 --> 00:07:12.460
Well, that was close.

00:07:12.493 --> 00:07:14.495
You must've been terrified.

00:07:14.528 --> 00:07:15.663
It's all good.

00:07:15.696 --> 00:07:17.131
You're safe with me.

00:07:17.164 --> 00:07:20.134
(Botamon cooing)

00:07:20.167 --> 00:07:21.335
Focus.

00:07:21.368 --> 00:07:24.338
I need to find a spot where
we can stay out of trouble.

00:07:26.173 --> 00:07:27.808
And we're off!

00:07:27.842 --> 00:07:29.844
There's no use sitting around.

00:07:29.877 --> 00:07:31.879
(Tai grunting)

00:07:31.912 --> 00:07:32.913
This way!

00:07:33.581 --> 00:07:35.516
I don't know, I got nothing.

00:07:35.549 --> 00:07:37.351
(melancholic music)

00:07:40.971 --> 00:07:42.339
(Digivice beeping)

00:07:42.373 --> 00:07:43.707
So that's your name, huh?

00:07:45.142 --> 00:07:46.277
Botamon.

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:47.311
You lost out here?

00:07:49.213 --> 00:07:51.382
Did you get split up
from all your friends?

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:54.018
(Tai chuckling)

00:07:54.051 --> 00:07:55.653
So that makes two of us.

00:07:55.686 --> 00:07:57.655
Usually, it's just
me and Agumon.

00:07:57.688 --> 00:07:58.689
(Tai grunting)

00:07:58.722 --> 00:08:00.324
We're partners.

00:08:00.357 --> 00:08:03.461
When Agumon digivolves,
he gets bigger, (grunting)

00:08:03.494 --> 00:08:05.129
and stronger.

00:08:05.162 --> 00:08:07.665
He's a great partner
I can really rely on.

00:08:07.698 --> 00:08:09.200
(Botamon cooing)

00:08:09.233 --> 00:08:12.703
When I saw that big ol'
troll chasing you earlier,

00:08:12.736 --> 00:08:15.039
it reminded me Agumon.

00:08:15.072 --> 00:08:16.373
The first time we met.

00:08:18.075 --> 00:08:19.176
(Botamon cooing)

00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:21.312
I got no business scrapping
with Digimon one-on-one,

00:08:21.345 --> 00:08:23.013
but I guess I just
started moving

00:08:23.047 --> 00:08:24.648
before I had time to think.

00:08:24.682 --> 00:08:27.418
(Botamon cooing)

00:08:29.587 --> 00:08:31.055
(Tai gasping)

00:08:31.088 --> 00:08:32.423
That bird again.

00:08:33.357 --> 00:08:34.325
(Tai gasping)

00:08:34.358 --> 00:08:37.728
(air whooshing)

00:08:37.761 --> 00:08:40.264
(Tai panting)

00:08:42.066 --> 00:08:43.067
(Goblimon roaring)

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:44.235
(Tai gasping)

00:08:44.268 --> 00:08:45.236
(Tai grunting)

00:08:45.269 --> 00:08:46.370
(suspenseful music)

00:08:46.403 --> 00:08:47.671
(Tai gasping)

00:08:47.705 --> 00:08:50.708
(suspenseful music)

00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:54.078
(Tai grunting)

00:08:54.111 --> 00:08:56.514
(Tai panting)

00:08:56.547 --> 00:08:59.550
(suspenseful music)

00:09:02.386 --> 00:09:05.189
(Tai gasping)

00:09:05.222 --> 00:09:06.857
(water burbling)

00:09:06.891 --> 00:09:07.892
Stay close.

00:09:08.792 --> 00:09:10.361
This might get ugly.

00:09:10.394 --> 00:09:12.863
(Goblimon growling)

00:09:12.897 --> 00:09:15.199
(suspenseful music)

00:09:15.232 --> 00:09:16.901

00:09:16.934 --> 00:09:18.536
(footsteps thudding)

00:09:18.569 --> 00:09:20.571
(suspenseful music)

00:09:20.604 --> 00:09:21.572
(Tai grunting)

00:09:21.605 --> 00:09:22.940
(Tai yelling)

00:09:22.973 --> 00:09:24.041
(water splashing)

00:09:24.074 --> 00:09:27.077
(suspenseful music)

00:09:28.279 --> 00:09:30.981
(water burbling)

00:09:33.918 --> 00:09:36.253
(Tai gasping)

00:09:36.287 --> 00:09:38.789
(Tai yelling)

00:09:38.822 --> 00:09:41.825
(suspenseful music)

00:09:43.594 --> 00:09:45.095
(Tai gasping)

00:09:45.129 --> 00:09:48.132
(suspenseful music)

00:09:49.833 --> 00:09:52.303
(Tai grunting)

00:09:52.336 --> 00:09:55.439
(Tai panting)

00:09:55.472 --> 00:09:57.308
(Botamon cooing)

00:09:57.341 --> 00:09:59.977
(Tai chuckling)

00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:01.245
Don't worry.

00:10:01.278 --> 00:10:02.846
It's not my first high dive.

00:10:10.821 --> 00:10:11.989
Something like this happened

00:10:12.022 --> 00:10:14.491
right after we came
to the Digital World.

00:10:14.525 --> 00:10:17.528
(suspenseful music)

00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:20.831
(tree branch crashing)

00:10:20.864 --> 00:10:22.499
(suspenseful music)

00:10:22.533 --> 00:10:23.834
(Tai gasping)

00:10:23.867 --> 00:10:27.104
(Seadramon roaring)

00:10:27.137 --> 00:10:30.140
(suspenseful music)

00:10:31.976 --> 00:10:35.012
(Tai yelling)

00:10:35.045 --> 00:10:36.780
(water burbling)

00:10:36.814 --> 00:10:39.717
(suspenseful music)

00:10:42.353 --> 00:10:44.855
(Tai gasping)

00:10:44.888 --> 00:10:47.358
(Tai yelling)

00:10:47.391 --> 00:10:50.461
(suspenseful music)

00:10:50.494 --> 00:10:53.330
(Tai grunting)

00:10:53.364 --> 00:10:56.166
(Tai yelling)

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:57.868
(Tai grunting)

00:10:57.901 --> 00:10:59.803
(Tai gasping)

00:10:59.837 --> 00:11:02.339
(suspenseful music)

00:11:02.373 --> 00:11:04.141
Get ready to hold your breath!

00:11:04.174 --> 00:11:05.876
(Tai inhaling deeply)

00:11:05.909 --> 00:11:08.212
(suspenseful music)

00:11:08.245 --> 00:11:11.048
(water burbling)

00:11:11.915 --> 00:11:14.351
(Tai yelling)

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:19.023
(Tai yelling)

00:11:20.024 --> 00:11:23.027
(suspenseful music)

00:11:26.063 --> 00:11:28.399
(tree branch crunching)

00:11:28.432 --> 00:11:30.567
(Tai gasping)

00:11:30.601 --> 00:11:33.570
(suspenseful music)

00:11:39.043 --> 00:11:40.210
(Tai grunting)

00:11:40.244 --> 00:11:42.713
(suspenseful music)

00:11:42.746 --> 00:11:45.215
(Tai gasping)

00:11:49.053 --> 00:11:51.588
(Tai grunting)

00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:57.461
(Tai panting)

00:11:59.963 --> 00:12:02.533
(Seadramon growling)

00:12:02.566 --> 00:12:05.436
(Tai panting)

00:12:05.469 --> 00:12:08.105
(Tai sighing)

00:12:08.138 --> 00:12:10.741
(bright music)

00:12:14.645 --> 00:12:17.481
(bubbles popping)

00:12:19.283 --> 00:12:20.617
(Tai gasping)

00:12:20.651 --> 00:12:23.220
(Botamon cooing)

00:12:23.253 --> 00:12:25.255
That's a cool little
trick you got there.

00:12:26.323 --> 00:12:28.292
I appreciate you looking
out for me, buddy.

00:12:28.325 --> 00:12:30.427
(Botamon cooing)

00:12:30.461 --> 00:12:31.729
Don't you worry about me.

00:12:31.762 --> 00:12:33.063
I'm all right.

00:12:33.097 --> 00:12:34.064
What about you?

00:12:34.098 --> 00:12:35.933
Are you okay?

00:12:35.966 --> 00:12:37.735
That must've been scary, huh?

00:12:37.768 --> 00:12:39.737
(Botamon cooing)

00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:42.973
If only I could
digivolve. (chuckling)

00:12:43.006 --> 00:12:46.310
Then I'd be way better at
protecting friends like you.

00:12:46.343 --> 00:12:47.811
(Botamon cooing)

00:12:47.845 --> 00:12:51.014
(footsteps pattering)

00:12:52.282 --> 00:12:54.785
(Tai gasping)

00:12:58.288 --> 00:12:59.456
How about that?

00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:00.958
Looks like we got a stalker.

00:13:02.025 --> 00:13:05.496
(air whooshing)

00:13:05.529 --> 00:13:07.931
(footsteps pattering)

00:13:07.965 --> 00:13:09.933
(suspenseful music)

00:13:09.967 --> 00:13:13.036
(footsteps thudding)

00:13:14.371 --> 00:13:17.341
(Tai grunting)

00:13:17.374 --> 00:13:19.176
(Allomon roaring)

00:13:19.209 --> 00:13:20.444
Allomon, great!

00:13:20.477 --> 00:13:22.112
Never ends.

00:13:22.146 --> 00:13:24.648
(Tai gasping)

00:13:25.549 --> 00:13:26.984
(Allomon roaring)

00:13:27.017 --> 00:13:28.318

(Tai grunting)

00:13:31.488 --> 00:13:34.625
(suspenseful music)

00:13:34.658 --> 00:13:36.794
(Allomon shooting fire)

00:13:36.827 --> 00:13:38.829
(Tai grunting)

00:13:38.862 --> 00:13:41.632
(suspenseful music)

00:13:41.665 --> 00:13:44.568
(footstep thudding)

00:13:45.402 --> 00:13:46.370
(Tai gasping)

00:13:46.403 --> 00:13:47.871
(suspenseful music)

00:13:47.905 --> 00:13:51.408
(Botamon blowing bubbles)

00:13:52.409 --> 00:13:53.811
Perfect timing, dude!

00:13:53.844 --> 00:13:54.978
Nice save!

00:13:55.012 --> 00:13:58.182
(Tai panting)

00:13:58.215 --> 00:14:01.985
(suspenseful music)

00:14:02.019 --> 00:14:03.320
(Tai yelling)

00:14:03.353 --> 00:14:04.988
(Tai grunting)

00:14:05.022 --> 00:14:06.390
(Tai gasping)

00:14:06.423 --> 00:14:09.426
(suspenseful music)

00:14:11.195 --> 00:14:12.529
(Tai shuddering)

00:14:12.563 --> 00:14:15.999
(suspenseful music)

00:14:16.033 --> 00:14:17.234
(Botamon cooing)

00:14:17.267 --> 00:14:20.704
When I say go, you bring
on the bubbles, got it?

00:14:20.737 --> 00:14:23.507
(suspenseful music)

00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:24.575
And now!

00:14:24.608 --> 00:14:27.878
(Botamon cooing)

00:14:27.911 --> 00:14:30.714
(Tai grunting)

00:14:30.747 --> 00:14:33.250
(Tai yelling)

00:14:35.219 --> 00:14:36.420
(Tai grunting)

00:14:36.453 --> 00:14:38.956
(Tai gasping)

00:14:41.925 --> 00:14:45.395
(footsteps thudding)

00:14:45.429 --> 00:14:48.232
(Allomon roaring)

00:14:50.067 --> 00:14:53.103
(footsteps thudding)

00:14:53.136 --> 00:14:56.540
(flames whooshing)

00:14:56.573 --> 00:14:59.409
(flames thudding)

00:15:01.812 --> 00:15:03.914
Listen, I'm gonna distract them.

00:15:05.415 --> 00:15:07.584
Once I do, you'll have to run.

00:15:07.618 --> 00:15:10.420
(Botamon cooing)

00:15:12.422 --> 00:15:13.924
You and I are buds now.

00:15:15.425 --> 00:15:16.426
You understand?

00:15:17.327 --> 00:15:19.296
And if it's to
protect my friends,

00:15:19.329 --> 00:15:21.498
there's nothing I can't
see my way through.

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:24.768
You ready?

00:15:24.801 --> 00:15:27.471
I'm not going down without
a fight, so bring it on!

00:15:27.504 --> 00:15:29.306
'Cause it's now or never!

00:15:29.339 --> 00:15:30.340
Let's go!

00:15:34.177 --> 00:15:37.481
(Tai panting)

00:15:37.514 --> 00:15:40.150
(Tai grunting)

00:15:40.183 --> 00:15:41.485
Run!

00:15:41.518 --> 00:15:44.521
(suspenseful music)

00:15:45.455 --> 00:15:46.757
(Allomon roaring)

00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:48.659
(Allomon crashing)

00:15:48.692 --> 00:15:51.361
(Tai screaming)

00:15:55.032 --> 00:15:57.134
(Tai grunting)

00:15:57.167 --> 00:16:00.938
(suspenseful music)

00:16:00.971 --> 00:16:04.107
(Tai screaming)

00:16:04.141 --> 00:16:06.510
(Tai grunting)

00:16:06.543 --> 00:16:09.646
(footsteps thudding)

00:16:10.547 --> 00:16:12.649
(Tai grunting)

00:16:12.683 --> 00:16:15.118
(Botamon cooing)

00:16:15.152 --> 00:16:18.155
(suspenseful music)

00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:29.333
(footstep thudding)

00:16:31.835 --> 00:16:34.838
(suspenseful music)

00:16:39.676 --> 00:16:41.678
You're digivolving.

00:16:41.712 --> 00:16:42.679
(Tai grunting)

00:16:42.713 --> 00:16:45.549
(Greymon roaring)

00:16:48.752 --> 00:16:51.521
(Tai screaming)

00:16:53.357 --> 00:16:56.360
(suspenseful music)

00:17:06.703 --> 00:17:09.464
(sword clanging)

00:17:16.188 --> 00:17:17.189
You did it.

00:17:22.494 --> 00:17:23.462
(Tai grunting)

00:17:23.495 --> 00:17:24.463
(Tai gasping)

00:17:24.496 --> 00:17:27.232
(Botamon cooing)

00:17:31.002 --> 00:17:33.505
(Tai gasping)

00:17:36.241 --> 00:17:37.576
Thanks, Botamon.

00:17:43.715 --> 00:17:45.550
So, is it over?

00:17:45.584 --> 00:17:47.719
Did you find out
what you needed?

00:17:47.753 --> 00:17:48.720
[Valkyrimon] Yes.

00:17:48.754 --> 00:17:50.822
The answer has been revealed.

00:17:50.856 --> 00:17:53.058
Then tell me, what's
this great power

00:17:53.091 --> 00:17:54.826
that you were mentioning before?

00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:56.328
Is it something we can use

00:17:56.361 --> 00:17:59.231
in order to stop the Great
Catastrophe from happening?

00:17:59.264 --> 00:18:02.234
The first time the great
power appeared in this world

00:18:02.267 --> 00:18:04.069
was eons ago.

00:18:04.102 --> 00:18:06.605
It manifested during
the ancient war.

00:18:09.374 --> 00:18:12.677
(light beaming)

00:18:12.711 --> 00:18:15.547
(exploding sound)

00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:18.283
(dramatic music)

00:18:22.954 --> 00:18:26.024
Whether they were injured
or had fallen in battle,

00:18:26.057 --> 00:18:29.428
the hearts of the Digimon who
fought to triumph over evil

00:18:29.461 --> 00:18:32.364
in the name of peace became one.

00:18:32.397 --> 00:18:33.965
Uniting in that moment.

00:18:35.066 --> 00:18:37.736
(air whooshing)

00:18:42.574 --> 00:18:45.610
As the souls of those
warriors came together,

00:18:45.644 --> 00:18:49.548
they fused into a noble
being of immense power,

00:18:49.581 --> 00:18:51.616
ushering forth a miracle.

00:18:55.487 --> 00:18:58.790
(light beaming)

00:18:58.824 --> 00:19:01.293
The great power has
already made an appearance

00:19:01.326 --> 00:19:03.228
in this era as well.

00:19:03.261 --> 00:19:06.064
Not once, but twice.

00:19:06.097 --> 00:19:08.567
Brought about by
the Digi-Destined.

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:10.302
(Tai gasping)

00:19:10.335 --> 00:19:14.773
It was your determination,
your steadfast resolve,

00:19:14.806 --> 00:19:18.076
and, of course, your courage.

00:19:18.109 --> 00:19:20.645
The heart that beats
deep within you.

00:19:20.679 --> 00:19:23.315
That is what summoned
the great power.

00:19:25.517 --> 00:19:29.588
It is an existence that
surpasses time and space.

00:19:29.621 --> 00:19:32.357
(dramatic music)

00:19:38.463 --> 00:19:41.132
That existence holds
a shape in this world,

00:19:41.166 --> 00:19:43.835
borne out of fervent invocation,

00:19:43.869 --> 00:19:47.639
emerging only as a result
of wishes and prayers.

00:19:47.672 --> 00:19:49.608
To every living creature,

00:19:49.641 --> 00:19:51.676
it is the very last light.

00:19:53.144 --> 00:19:55.280
It is the ultimate miracle.

00:19:55.313 --> 00:19:58.717
One which could even overturn
the end of the world.

00:20:01.386 --> 00:20:03.889
(Tai gasping)

00:20:06.057 --> 00:20:08.159
[Tai] Could that
be what saves us?

00:20:10.228 --> 00:20:14.499
The key to activating the
great power is the heart.

00:20:16.167 --> 00:20:18.537
Digimon and humans.

00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:22.474
If a multitude of hearts
pray for the same resolution,

00:20:22.507 --> 00:20:23.975
that will become the key

00:20:24.009 --> 00:20:26.845
to overcoming the
impending disaster.

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:30.048
[Agumon] Tai?

00:20:30.081 --> 00:20:32.551
(Tai gasping)

00:20:36.688 --> 00:20:39.357
(air whooshing)

00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:43.395
[Tai] Agumon?

00:20:43.428 --> 00:20:44.696
Is everything okay?

00:20:44.729 --> 00:20:46.898
You were kinda zoned
out there for a while.

00:20:49.034 --> 00:20:50.235
(Agumon chuckling)

00:20:50.268 --> 00:20:52.537
Hey, that tickles.

00:20:52.571 --> 00:20:55.574
Hey, buddy, question.

00:20:55.607 --> 00:20:59.544
You've been next to me this
entire time, haven't you?

00:20:59.578 --> 00:21:01.079
Huh?

00:21:01.112 --> 00:21:02.113
Of course.

00:21:02.914 --> 00:21:04.215
Just checking.

00:21:05.584 --> 00:21:07.285
There you are, Tai!

00:21:08.753 --> 00:21:11.523
Hey now, don't go running
off without us, Agumon!

00:21:11.556 --> 00:21:12.524
(Agumon chuckling)

00:21:12.557 --> 00:21:14.693
[Agumon] Sorry! (chuckling)

00:21:14.726 --> 00:21:17.729
(melancholic music)

00:21:20.265 --> 00:21:23.134

00:21:27.572 --> 00:21:28.940

00:21:28.974 --> 00:21:31.476
(Tai gasping)

00:21:32.978 --> 00:21:33.945

00:22:42.881 --> 00:22:44.149
Botamon.

00:22:44.182 --> 00:22:46.484
This newborn is an
In-Training Digimon.

00:22:46.518 --> 00:22:47.952
They don't know how to fight,

00:22:47.986 --> 00:22:49.454
but they do shoot out bubbles

00:22:49.487 --> 00:22:51.956
that can throw off even
the toughest of enemies.

00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:54.025
Let's check out some
more facts about 'em.

00:22:54.059 --> 00:22:55.527
Depending on how they're raised,

00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:57.962
Botamon grow into
all sorts of Digimon.

00:22:57.996 --> 00:23:00.365
I wonder if that means they
have a rebellious phase

00:23:00.398 --> 00:23:02.033
like teenagers do?

00:23:02.067 --> 00:23:03.635
That would be tough to handle!

00:23:03.668 --> 00:23:06.371
(bright music)

00:23:06.404 --> 00:23:08.740
Which Digimon will
it be next time?

00:23:10.375 --> 00:23:12.544
[Narrator] The worst
enemy of the Digi-Destined

00:23:12.577 --> 00:23:14.713
has finally made a move.

00:23:14.746 --> 00:23:17.015
In the face of extreme danger,

00:23:17.048 --> 00:23:19.217
their toughest battle begins.

00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:21.653
[Tai] Next time: "The
Angels' Determination."

00:23:21.686 --> 00:23:24.255

continues in a new world.
