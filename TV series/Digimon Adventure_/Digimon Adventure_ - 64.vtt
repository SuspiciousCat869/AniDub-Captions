[T.K. and Patamon] Huh?

[Devimon] My friend.

00:02:08.556 --> 00:02:09.557

What are you doing here?

00:02:23.738 --> 00:02:24.739
I hear it.

00:02:25.973 --> 00:02:26.974
The sound.

00:02:27.908 --> 00:02:29.877
[T.K.] Sound?

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.115
The sound that once
drove the world mad

00:02:34.148 --> 00:02:35.649
and gave me form.

00:02:37.785 --> 00:02:41.756

(T.K. and Patamon gasping)

00:02:44.825 --> 00:02:47.228

Hope, even despair.

00:02:50.331 --> 00:02:54.268
All will fade into

The Great Catastrophe?

[Devimon] It cannot
be stopped by anyone.

00:03:05.346 --> 00:03:06.313
We'll stop it,

00:03:06.347 --> 00:03:07.982
and that's a promise!

00:03:08.015 --> 00:03:09.583
Hmm.

00:03:09.617 --> 00:03:11.085
(Devimon chuckling)

00:03:11.118 --> 00:03:13.587
[Devimon] Of course you will.

00:03:13.621 --> 00:03:16.824
Let me see you try,

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.456
[T.K. and Patamon] Huh?

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:51.492
(Trailmon clacking)

00:03:53.394 --> 00:03:54.962

[Patamon] Gatomon!

00:03:57.898 --> 00:04:00.501
(gentle music)

00:04:01.836 --> 00:04:04.872
[Narrator] In order to
prevent the Great Catastrophe,

00:04:04.905 --> 00:04:07.041
the Digi-Destined
have sought to uncover

00:04:07.074 --> 00:04:08.909
the mystery of the crests.

00:04:10.344 --> 00:04:12.580
And they have all reached
the same conclusion.

00:04:16.851 --> 00:04:18.486
Each of us has gained something

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.188
from the places where
the Digivices led us.

00:04:23.357 --> 00:04:26.560
Now the path to overcoming
the Great Catastrophe

00:04:26.594 --> 00:04:28.262
should soon become clear.

00:04:29.697 --> 00:04:32.066
Therefore, it's important that
we reunite with the others

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:33.901
as soon as possible.

00:04:33.934 --> 00:04:36.871
[Kari] Tai's group is headed
toward Wisemon's place too.

00:04:38.873 --> 00:04:39.874
Oh.

00:04:41.775 --> 00:04:42.843
Hmm?

00:04:42.877 --> 00:04:44.211
Is something wrong?

00:04:44.245 --> 00:04:45.713
Huh?

00:04:45.746 --> 00:04:49.917
Oh, I was just thinking
about a weird dream I had.

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.086
That's funny, I had
a weird dream too.

00:04:52.119 --> 00:04:53.120
-Huh?
-Hmm.

00:04:55.089 --> 00:04:56.090
I see.

00:04:57.057 --> 00:04:59.260
Well, if this warning
is indeed true,

00:04:59.293 --> 00:05:02.596
then Devimon was connected to
the Great Catastrophe as well.

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:03.597
Maybe.

00:05:03.631 --> 00:05:05.266
Devimon was driven by a force

00:05:05.299 --> 00:05:07.234
even more powerful than he was.

00:05:07.268 --> 00:05:08.602
(all gasping)

00:05:08.636 --> 00:05:10.471
Devimon was studying
digivolution

00:05:11.605 --> 00:05:13.908
in order to achieve
a great power

00:05:13.941 --> 00:05:16.710
and defy the laws of nature.

00:05:16.744 --> 00:05:18.579
But instead of that-

00:05:18.612 --> 00:05:19.880
Hmm.

00:05:19.914 --> 00:05:24.118
Spun out of control
into utter madness.

00:05:24.151 --> 00:05:27.254
It led to destruction.

00:05:27.288 --> 00:05:28.722
Destruction?

00:05:28.756 --> 00:05:31.792
And, afterwards, the system
born from that process

00:05:31.825 --> 00:05:35.663
was repurposed by Vademon
to revive Millenniummon.

00:05:37.298 --> 00:05:39.567
You mean the black lightning?

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.635
Yes, Millenniummon.

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:44.405
Moved neither by
ambition nor power.

00:05:44.438 --> 00:05:47.775
An existence who desired
only destruction.

00:05:47.808 --> 00:05:50.477
If we hadn't stopped
Millenniummon,

00:05:50.511 --> 00:05:53.414
the whole world, it
would've been destroyed,

00:05:53.447 --> 00:05:54.782
without a doubt.

00:05:54.815 --> 00:05:56.984
I remember Wisemon
saying that Millenniummon

00:05:57.017 --> 00:05:59.987
might have been part of
the Great Catastrophe.

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:03.157
Yes, then the
ancient war as well,

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:05.659
which sparked
Millenniummon's creation.

00:06:08.329 --> 00:06:11.031
I'm starting to think what
started that war was...

00:06:14.835 --> 00:06:15.836
Hmm.

00:06:17.304 --> 00:06:18.606
(Digivice beeping)

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:19.607
(all gasping)

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:20.608
[Izzy] This is Izzy.

00:06:20.641 --> 00:06:21.842
Do you copy?

00:06:21.875 --> 00:06:24.278
I just got an emergency
call from Garbagemon.

00:06:24.311 --> 00:06:26.947
(Komondomon barking)

00:06:26.981 --> 00:06:29.350
[Wisemon] We are currently
under heavy attack.

00:06:30.818 --> 00:06:34.154
[Garbagemon] It looks to be
a huge swarm of Soundbirdmon.

00:06:34.188 --> 00:06:35.356
[Izzy] Soundbirdmon?

00:06:35.389 --> 00:06:36.490
Again?

00:06:36.523 --> 00:06:37.958
[Garbagemon] We can't
handle them all.

00:06:37.992 --> 00:06:39.293
We need help.

00:06:39.326 --> 00:06:40.628
[Izzy] Understood.

00:06:40.661 --> 00:06:42.529
We'll rush over at full speed.

00:06:42.563 --> 00:06:43.564
[T.K.] Us too!

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:47.201
(Digimon screaming)

00:06:47.234 --> 00:06:48.702
[Wisemon] Everyone evacuate

00:06:48.736 --> 00:06:51.805
and head underground where
the sound cannot reach.

00:06:51.839 --> 00:06:54.008
I can hardly think
with all this noise!

00:06:54.041 --> 00:06:55.476
But we've got to keep sane

00:06:55.509 --> 00:06:58.212
or will lose all our
precious knowledge.

00:06:58.245 --> 00:07:00.681
Yes, Nanomon was
caught off guard,

00:07:00.714 --> 00:07:02.383
but as long as we stay alert...

00:07:02.416 --> 00:07:03.384
(laser beaming)

00:07:03.417 --> 00:07:04.718

[Garbagemon]
Mekanorimon? (shuddering)

00:07:09.757 --> 00:07:11.225
I see.

00:07:11.258 --> 00:07:14.828
The sound has a strong
effect on Machine Digimon.

00:07:14.862 --> 00:07:17.398
This brings joy to my knowledge.

00:07:17.431 --> 00:07:20.234
Now it's not the
time! (shuddering)

There, why don't you guys just
stay like that for a while?

00:07:31.612 --> 00:07:34.415
(Garbagemon gasping)

Are you all right, Garbagemon?

00:07:50.964 --> 00:07:52.266
Uh-huh!

00:07:52.299 --> 00:07:54.435
[Gatomon] What is
happening here?

00:07:54.468 --> 00:07:56.537
[Garbagemon] I don't
know, but whatever it is,

00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:59.415
it just started happening
all of a sudden.

00:08:06.063 --> 00:08:09.566
(wings flapping)

I had always assumed they
were minions of Devimon.

00:08:15.572 --> 00:08:17.040
[Wisemon] Hmm?

00:08:17.074 --> 00:08:19.410
They're headed toward the
monoliths bearing the crests!

00:08:19.443 --> 00:08:21.044
(Garbagemon grunting)

00:08:21.078 --> 00:08:24.615
First Burpmon, and
now this! (shuddering)

Ingenious.

[Wisemon] I see.

00:08:38.462 --> 00:08:40.764
Radio waves can
intercept the sound.

00:08:41.932 --> 00:08:43.934
Let Searchmon and me
handle things here.

00:08:43.967 --> 00:08:46.403
You've got to get over there
and protect the monoliths.

Thanks, we'll do that.

00:08:47.604 --> 00:08:48.572

Could this be the sound that
Devimon was talking about?

00:09:02.319 --> 00:09:05.322
(suspenseful music)

00:09:05.355 --> 00:09:06.323
(footsteps thudding)

00:09:06.356 --> 00:09:09.326
(all screaming)

00:09:09.359 --> 00:09:12.463
(air whooshing)

00:09:12.496 --> 00:09:15.766
(suspenseful music)

00:09:15.799 --> 00:09:17.668
[Wisemon] They are
unifying bits of data

00:09:17.701 --> 00:09:19.336
and controlling them.

00:09:19.369 --> 00:09:21.138
Such enormous power.

00:09:21.171 --> 00:09:22.673
(footsteps thudding)

00:09:22.706 --> 00:09:24.975
(Garbagemon screaming)

00:09:25.008 --> 00:09:28.111
[MetalGreymon] Giga Blaster!

00:09:28.145 --> 00:09:29.513
(Digimon exploding)

00:09:29.546 --> 00:09:31.949
[Kari] Tai, MetalGreymon!

00:09:31.982 --> 00:09:33.817
Sorry, we're late.

00:09:33.851 --> 00:09:35.786
The others are right behind us.

00:09:35.819 --> 00:09:39.122
(suspenseful music)

00:09:39.156 --> 00:09:40.123
Woohoo!

00:09:40.157 --> 00:09:41.492
(Searchmon beeping)

00:09:41.525 --> 00:09:43.293
[Izzy] Everybody
holding up all right?

00:09:43.327 --> 00:09:44.962
[WereGarurumon]
That was close, huh?

00:09:44.995 --> 00:09:47.297
[Kabuterimon] Good
work, Searchmon.

00:09:47.331 --> 00:09:49.466
We're not done yet.

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:50.534
(suspenseful music)

00:09:50.567 --> 00:09:52.503
(radar beaming)

00:09:52.536 --> 00:09:54.037
Meteor Wing!

00:09:54.071 --> 00:09:56.840
(meteor firing)

00:09:56.874 --> 00:09:59.843
(suspenseful music)

00:09:59.877 --> 00:10:02.012
Palmon digivolve to...

00:10:02.045 --> 00:10:03.046
Togemon!

00:10:03.747 --> 00:10:04.748
Needle Spray!

00:10:05.716 --> 00:10:07.885
(thorns shooting)

00:10:07.918 --> 00:10:10.387
Gomamon digivolve to...

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:11.421
Ikkakumon!

00:10:12.389 --> 00:10:13.824
Everyone's here.

00:10:13.857 --> 00:10:15.893
Harpoon Torpedo!

00:10:15.926 --> 00:10:18.328
(torpedo shooting)

00:10:18.362 --> 00:10:19.663
(torpedo exploding)

00:10:19.696 --> 00:10:21.365
(MetalGreymon growling)

00:10:21.398 --> 00:10:25.068
(suspenseful music)

00:10:25.102 --> 00:10:27.838
(footsteps thudding)

00:10:27.871 --> 00:10:31.074
[Gatomon] Thank goodness
this place wasn't damaged.

00:10:31.108 --> 00:10:34.177
(monoliths beaming)

00:10:34.211 --> 00:10:35.379
Hmm?

00:10:35.412 --> 00:10:37.381
I've never seen
them do this before.

00:10:38.549 --> 00:10:41.451
(monoliths beaming)

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:46.023
(footsteps pattering)

00:10:46.056 --> 00:10:48.091
They are resonating
with the children.

00:10:48.125 --> 00:10:50.227
We must gather all of
them here immediately.

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:51.228
(monitor beeping)

00:10:51.261 --> 00:10:52.729
Hmm?

00:10:52.763 --> 00:10:55.899
Wisemon, the Soundbirdmon
are suddenly acting strange.

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:58.368
(Sora gasping)

00:10:58.402 --> 00:11:01.405
(suspenseful music)

00:11:10.581 --> 00:11:13.283
(wings flapping)

00:11:14.618 --> 00:11:16.386
(Tai gasping)

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:20.557
[T.K.] The Soundbirmon,
they're all clumping together.

00:11:20.591 --> 00:11:22.125
I don't believe it.

00:11:22.159 --> 00:11:23.627
Could that be...

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:27.397
(Soundbirdmon chirping)

00:11:27.431 --> 00:11:29.833
(all gasping)

00:11:31.001 --> 00:11:33.670
(dramatic music)

00:11:42.479 --> 00:11:45.449
(suspenseful music)

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:03.333
(bright music)

00:12:03.367 --> 00:12:06.136
(dramatic music)

00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:15.812
That Digimon...

00:12:15.846 --> 00:12:18.649
(dramatic music)

00:12:27.057 --> 00:12:29.326
We've seen that one before,

00:12:29.359 --> 00:12:31.461
in that old footage
of the ancient war.

00:12:31.495 --> 00:12:34.464
Yes, the one who leads
the Dark Digimon,

00:12:34.498 --> 00:12:36.967
the king of darkness, Ghoulmon.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.670
(Ghoulmon screeching)

00:12:39.703 --> 00:12:42.139
(all screaming)

00:12:42.172 --> 00:12:43.640
Ghoulmon.

00:12:43.674 --> 00:12:46.977
The records state that the
war between light and darkness

00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:49.379
began with Ghoulmon's attacks.

00:12:50.514 --> 00:12:53.350
Ghoulmon tried to
destroy the darkness,

00:12:53.383 --> 00:12:55.886
despite belonging to it.

00:12:55.919 --> 00:12:58.321
That remains a mystery.

00:12:58.355 --> 00:13:00.991
However, if Ghoulmon's existence

00:13:01.024 --> 00:13:02.893
was an omen of the
Great Catastrophe,

00:13:02.926 --> 00:13:06.163
if Ghoulmon is the
face of the disaster

00:13:06.196 --> 00:13:07.931
that drives the world mad...

00:13:08.932 --> 00:13:11.935
(laser beam firing)

00:13:14.771 --> 00:13:17.574
(all crying)

00:13:17.607 --> 00:13:20.377
(dramatic music)

00:13:22.713 --> 00:13:25.749
(sphere beeping)

00:13:25.782 --> 00:13:28.685
(Ghoulmon's eye beeping)

00:13:28.719 --> 00:13:30.087
(wall crashing)

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:32.622
(all gasping)

00:13:36.393 --> 00:13:37.527
(laser beam firing)

00:13:37.561 --> 00:13:38.528
(Tai gasping)

00:13:38.562 --> 00:13:41.565
(laser beam firing)

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:46.203
(dramatic music)

00:13:46.236 --> 00:13:48.572
(Leomon grunting)

00:13:48.605 --> 00:13:51.274
(radar beaming)

00:13:55.912 --> 00:13:58.648
(dramatic music)

00:14:04.955 --> 00:14:08.291
Is this the Great Catastrophe
that the children spoke of?

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:12.562
Is there a threat
closing in on us

00:14:12.596 --> 00:14:15.165
that may prove even more
terrible than Millenniummon?

00:14:17.667 --> 00:14:20.103
Is the world coming to an end?

00:14:22.105 --> 00:14:24.841
(dramatic music)

00:14:28.445 --> 00:14:31.248
(radar beaming)

00:14:31.281 --> 00:14:33.450
(dramatic music)

00:14:33.483 --> 00:14:36.119
No, that will never happen.

00:14:36.953 --> 00:14:38.155
Never!

00:14:38.188 --> 00:14:40.757
The Digi-Destined
will not allow it.

00:14:40.791 --> 00:14:42.943
We know we can count on them.

00:14:49.908 --> 00:14:52.177
(dramatic music)

00:14:52.210 --> 00:14:55.247
You are our light,
Digi-Destined.

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:58.250
(dramatic music)

00:14:58.283 --> 00:15:01.219
(Digivice beeping)

00:15:03.421 --> 00:15:06.224
(dramatic music)

00:15:10.962 --> 00:15:11.963
Our only hope.

00:15:13.231 --> 00:15:16.234
(Digivices beeping)

00:15:19.738 --> 00:15:22.474
(dramatic music)

00:15:24.276 --> 00:15:25.710
[Wisemon] Of course.

00:15:25.744 --> 00:15:27.412
Now I see.

00:15:27.445 --> 00:15:29.247
Here in this Digital World,

00:15:30.482 --> 00:15:33.218
the children's
reliability and sincerity

00:15:33.251 --> 00:15:35.187
have allowed them
to form lasting

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:36.621
friendships with Digimon.

00:15:37.956 --> 00:15:40.592
The Digi-Destined saved
us with knowledge,

00:15:40.625 --> 00:15:43.395
and nurtured us with
courage and love.

00:15:43.428 --> 00:15:45.330
Above all, they
have kindled hope.

00:15:47.332 --> 00:15:50.235
In other words, it
is they themselves,

00:15:50.268 --> 00:15:52.070
their entire adventure,

00:15:52.103 --> 00:15:54.639
that is the answer to
the crests' mystery.

00:15:54.673 --> 00:15:57.943
Where there is light,
there is also shadow.

00:15:57.976 --> 00:16:00.278
As light and darkness exist,

00:16:00.312 --> 00:16:02.781
so must order and harmony.

00:16:02.814 --> 00:16:03.982
Great Catastrophe,

00:16:04.015 --> 00:16:07.319
you whose evil could
deceive even darkness,

00:16:07.352 --> 00:16:10.989
tremble before
our light of hope.

00:16:11.022 --> 00:16:12.023
Angewomon!

00:16:12.857 --> 00:16:14.326
Yes, Kari!

00:16:14.359 --> 00:16:15.627
MagnaAngemon!

00:16:16.795 --> 00:16:18.530
I am with you, T.K.

00:16:22.367 --> 00:16:24.703
MagnaAngemon digivolve to...

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:33.878
(singing in Japanese)

00:16:40.218 --> 00:16:41.953
Seraphimon!

00:16:41.987 --> 00:16:45.323
(singing in Japanese)

00:16:45.357 --> 00:16:47.659
Angewomon digivolve to...

00:16:50.061 --> 00:16:54.899
(singing in Japanese)

00:17:07.679 --> 00:17:09.881
(javelin whooshing)

00:17:09.914 --> 00:17:10.915
Ophanimon!

00:17:12.751 --> 00:17:13.718
(Wisemon gasping)

00:17:13.752 --> 00:17:16.021
Seraphimon and Ophanimon!

00:17:17.222 --> 00:17:21.192
The Celestial Digimon
from the ancient war!

00:17:21.226 --> 00:17:22.560
(all gasping)

00:17:22.594 --> 00:17:25.563
(Ghoulmon growling)

00:17:25.597 --> 00:17:27.732
(laser beam firing)

00:17:27.766 --> 00:17:31.569
(singing in Japanese)

00:17:31.603 --> 00:17:36.508
We have been entrusted with
the hopes of many Digimon.

00:17:36.541 --> 00:17:40.745
This digivolution is a
light brought forth by all.

00:17:41.913 --> 00:17:43.848
(Ghoulmon grunting)

00:17:43.882 --> 00:17:46.718
(singing in Japanese)

00:17:46.751 --> 00:17:49.721
(laser beam firing)

00:17:50.555 --> 00:17:51.890
Seven Heavens!

00:17:53.058 --> 00:17:57.362
(singing in Japanese)

00:17:57.395 --> 00:17:59.431
(lasers crashing)

00:17:59.464 --> 00:18:04.302
(singing in Japanese)

00:18:07.906 --> 00:18:11.276
(T.K. grunting)

00:18:11.309 --> 00:18:13.778
(laser beams exploding)

00:18:13.812 --> 00:18:15.580
(singing in Japanese)

00:18:15.613 --> 00:18:19.050
(spheres of light firing)

00:18:19.084 --> 00:18:21.286
(Kari grunting)

00:18:21.319 --> 00:18:26.157
(singing in Japanese)

00:18:32.964 --> 00:18:34.332
Eden's Javelin!

00:18:37.669 --> 00:18:40.672
(light beam firing)

00:18:46.644 --> 00:18:49.180
(all cheering)

00:18:50.181 --> 00:18:53.284
(Ghoulmon crackling)

00:18:56.688 --> 00:18:58.823
[Negamon] I am...

00:18:58.857 --> 00:19:00.458
I am the first cry.

00:19:02.026 --> 00:19:05.196
The first cry sent
by the catastrophe.

00:19:06.698 --> 00:19:08.166
I will echo afar.

00:19:10.034 --> 00:19:11.536
When I end my cry,

00:19:13.037 --> 00:19:14.873
-it will begin.
-Begin.

00:19:15.807 --> 00:19:17.609
-Begin.
-Begin.

00:19:17.642 --> 00:19:19.144
[Negamon] Begin.

00:19:21.679 --> 00:19:25.784
And so begins the
Great Catastrophe.

00:19:25.817 --> 00:19:28.720
(sphere crackling)

00:19:36.494 --> 00:19:38.863
(sphere exploding)

00:19:38.897 --> 00:19:40.565
[Devimon] Negamon.

00:19:42.834 --> 00:19:43.802
[T.K.] Matt!

00:19:43.835 --> 00:19:44.803
[Matt] You did it.

00:19:44.836 --> 00:19:46.204
Not too shabby.

00:19:46.237 --> 00:19:47.505
We saw you digivolve.

00:19:47.539 --> 00:19:48.807
It was amazing.

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:50.308
Oh, thanks!

00:19:50.341 --> 00:19:51.309
Gee, whiz.

00:19:51.342 --> 00:19:52.877
You really saved our necks.

00:19:52.911 --> 00:19:54.712
Digi-Destined,

00:19:54.746 --> 00:19:58.883
this reunion brings great
joy to my knowledge.

00:19:58.917 --> 00:19:59.884
How about that?

00:19:59.918 --> 00:20:00.985
Wisemon's joyful.

00:20:01.019 --> 00:20:02.654
(all laughing)

00:20:02.687 --> 00:20:03.655
But, wait a second,

00:20:03.688 --> 00:20:04.889
so what happens now?

00:20:04.923 --> 00:20:07.358
Yeah, I suppose this
isn't the end of it.

00:20:07.392 --> 00:20:09.327
That would be too much to ask.

00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:10.829
Hmm.

00:20:10.862 --> 00:20:13.565
Has anyone else noticed the
crests have started to shine

00:20:13.598 --> 00:20:14.666
brighter and brighter?

00:20:14.699 --> 00:20:16.067
Huh?

00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:19.070
(all gasping)

00:20:19.103 --> 00:20:20.505
(Tai gasping)

00:20:20.538 --> 00:20:21.673
(all gasping)

00:20:21.706 --> 00:20:24.242
(gentle music)

00:20:38.423 --> 00:20:40.959
(Tai grunting)

00:20:43.628 --> 00:20:45.063
[Agumon] Tai, you good?

00:20:46.598 --> 00:20:48.433
[Biyomon] Sora? Sora?

00:20:48.466 --> 00:20:49.434
What is it?

00:20:49.467 --> 00:20:50.435
What happened?

00:20:50.468 --> 00:20:51.436
Whoa!

00:20:51.469 --> 00:20:52.871
(Garbagemon gasping)

00:20:52.904 --> 00:20:54.105
Huh?

00:20:54.138 --> 00:20:56.908
Hey, what happened
to the monoliths?

00:20:56.941 --> 00:20:59.544
It appears they've
vanished altogether.

00:20:59.577 --> 00:21:00.545
Like, poof!

00:21:00.578 --> 00:21:02.213

00:21:02.247 --> 00:21:03.248

00:21:07.986 --> 00:21:11.289
[Wisemon] Could those be
cracks in the dimension?

00:21:11.322 --> 00:21:13.625
[Palmon] There's nothing
on the other side.

00:21:13.658 --> 00:21:15.894
[Agumon] It's completely blank.

00:21:15.927 --> 00:21:17.161
[T.K.] Blank.

00:21:19.497 --> 00:21:20.999
All will vanish.

00:21:21.966 --> 00:21:23.601
Hope, even despair.

00:21:25.003 --> 00:21:29.307
All will fade into
the white void.

00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:31.910
[Patamon] The white void.

00:21:31.943 --> 00:21:34.479
