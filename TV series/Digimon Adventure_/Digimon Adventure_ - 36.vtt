alongside their partner Digimon

00:02:21.248 --> 00:02:24.051
The hands of evil that are
targeting the energy born

00:02:24.084 --> 00:02:25.919
from mass internet disruption

00:02:26.987 --> 00:02:29.056

Space Station

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:31.825

(suspenseful music)

00:02:35.596 --> 00:02:39.566
The estimated point
of impact is Tokyo.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.969
With the ISS drawing near,

00:02:42.002 --> 00:02:45.138
the Digi-destined are the
only ones who can stop it.

00:02:46.607 --> 00:02:49.443

(crowd chattering)

00:02:52.946 --> 00:02:54.915
And we still don't know
where it's landing?

00:02:56.183 --> 00:02:59.319
Not yet, we're still
trying to figure it out.

Moscow reporting.

00:03:00.954 --> 00:03:03.490
Why haven't you commanded a
shift to the ISS trajectory?

00:03:03.524 --> 00:03:05.259
[Houston Technician]
It's too late.

00:03:05.292 --> 00:03:07.261
We can't do anything
at this point.

00:03:07.294 --> 00:03:08.495
This is Tsukuba.

00:03:08.529 --> 00:03:10.664
The thermal control
system isn't working.

00:03:10.697 --> 00:03:12.933
At this rate, there's
a very real possibility

00:03:12.966 --> 00:03:14.334
the station may explode.

00:03:14.368 --> 00:03:16.169
We're all well aware of that.

00:03:16.203 --> 00:03:18.939
What we don't know is where
in Tokyo it will land.

00:03:18.972 --> 00:03:21.842
All our control systems
have failed to work.

00:03:21.875 --> 00:03:24.378
All we can do at
this point is pray.

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:28.282
(suspenseful music)

00:03:28.315 --> 00:03:30.484
Huh?

00:03:30.517 --> 00:03:32.686
Over here!

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:35.656
(computer beeping)

00:03:45.566 --> 00:03:46.700
You found these?

00:03:46.733 --> 00:03:47.734
What are they?

00:03:49.736 --> 00:03:52.339
[Agumon] Whoa, crazy!

00:03:52.372 --> 00:03:55.208
[T.K.] Are they Digimon fossils?

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.046
I bet those fossils are
from ancient Digimon.

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:00.814
And because they
were so massive,

00:04:00.847 --> 00:04:03.717
their fossils are
still intact even now.

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.218
I wonder what Digimon they were.

00:04:05.252 --> 00:04:07.387
They aren't gonna
start moving, right?

00:04:07.421 --> 00:04:08.855
Fossils aren't alive.

00:04:10.023 --> 00:04:11.892
Maybe it's the way
they're facing?

00:04:11.925 --> 00:04:14.828
But it looks like they're
in the middle of a battle.

00:04:14.861 --> 00:04:17.230
[Sora] Do you think these
fossils have something to do

00:04:17.264 --> 00:04:19.566
with the ancient battle
against Millenniummon?

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.868
No.

00:04:21.902 --> 00:04:24.171
Battles between Digimon
here in the Digital World

00:04:24.204 --> 00:04:27.341
are not only between
light and dark.

00:04:27.374 --> 00:04:29.710
Digimon are constantly
fighting one another

00:04:29.743 --> 00:04:32.179
for survival, power,

00:04:32.212 --> 00:04:34.281
and, at times, even pride.

00:04:36.049 --> 00:04:37.017
But, look!

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.251
In the sky over there.

00:04:38.285 --> 00:04:40.621
Do you see that giant
glowing pillar of light?

00:04:43.757 --> 00:04:45.225
Mm.

00:04:45.258 --> 00:04:47.361
I imagine that the
tremendous energy

00:04:47.394 --> 00:04:50.030
produced by the clash
of those two Digimon

00:04:50.063 --> 00:04:52.733
pierced the heavens and
even distorted space.

00:04:52.766 --> 00:04:55.068
And even now, after
all these years,

00:04:55.102 --> 00:04:56.903
its effects are still lingering.

00:04:58.472 --> 00:04:59.906
[Tentomon] Izzy
sure has been doing

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.577
an awful lot of research
ever since he got here.

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:04.611
So then, what do you think

00:05:04.645 --> 00:05:06.780
is at the top of
that pillar of light?

00:05:06.813 --> 00:05:08.115
Ooh, tell 'em, Izzy!

00:05:08.148 --> 00:05:10.250
That's the most
important part, isn't it?

00:05:10.283 --> 00:05:11.952
(monitor beeping)

00:05:11.985 --> 00:05:15.922
The top of that pillar of light
is basically a singularity

00:05:15.956 --> 00:05:18.125
leading outside of
the Digital World,

00:05:18.158 --> 00:05:21.561
to a place where the Network
is exposed and vulnerable.

00:05:21.595 --> 00:05:22.963
If I'm correct,

00:05:22.996 --> 00:05:25.966
we should be able to interact
with our world from there.

00:05:25.999 --> 00:05:27.467
What does that mean?

00:05:27.501 --> 00:05:30.804
It means we can do all sorts
of things to the human world

00:05:30.837 --> 00:05:33.306
while still being in
the Digital World.

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:35.742
And one of those things is-

00:05:35.776 --> 00:05:37.978
[Izzy] We can change
the ISS's trajectory

00:05:38.011 --> 00:05:39.946
from within the Network

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:43.950
the same way we were able to
prevent Tokyo's missile crash.

00:05:43.984 --> 00:05:46.753
(air whooshing)

00:05:46.787 --> 00:05:47.988
(radar beeping)

00:05:48.021 --> 00:05:50.457
Okay, I think I
get the rough idea.

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.627
But how are we actually
supposed to stop that thing?

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:55.128
If I'm being honest here,

00:05:55.162 --> 00:05:58.031
I don't even remember what I
did during the missile crisis.

00:05:59.299 --> 00:06:02.169
The data distorted
by Digimon's power

00:06:02.202 --> 00:06:04.438
will be fixed by
Digimon's power.

00:06:04.471 --> 00:06:07.274
(suspenseful music)

00:06:07.307 --> 00:06:09.676
We're going to snipe
the ISS control point

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:12.179
inside the Network
at a precise angle.

00:06:13.213 --> 00:06:16.116
We may even be able to shift
its path toward the ocean

00:06:16.149 --> 00:06:17.984
without destroying the station.

00:06:18.018 --> 00:06:19.986
(monitor beeping)

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:20.987
Terrific!

00:06:21.021 --> 00:06:22.189
Now, what does "snipe" mean?

00:06:22.222 --> 00:06:24.691
It means to target
and shoot something.

00:06:24.725 --> 00:06:26.626
Except we're not
going to destroy it,

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:28.195
we're going to divert it, right?

00:06:28.228 --> 00:06:29.863
Right, and if we succeed,

00:06:29.896 --> 00:06:32.666
then the city should also
be safe from any debris.

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:36.036
[T.K.] Which means no one
in Tokyo will be in danger.

00:06:36.069 --> 00:06:37.671
That's incredible, Izzy!

00:06:37.704 --> 00:06:39.639
I knew you'd come up with a plan

00:06:39.673 --> 00:06:42.142
But we only have one
chance to do this.

00:06:42.175 --> 00:06:43.543
There's no room for mistakes.

00:06:43.577 --> 00:06:45.145
It has to be perfect.

00:06:45.178 --> 00:06:47.180
Not to mention there are
several uncertainties

00:06:47.214 --> 00:06:49.015
I haven't worked out yet.

00:06:49.049 --> 00:06:50.317
And there's no guarantee

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:51.885
this will actually
work in practice.

00:06:51.918 --> 00:06:55.388
So this whole operation
is a huge gamble then?

00:06:55.422 --> 00:06:56.823
(Sora gasping)

00:06:56.857 --> 00:06:59.226
But if somehow we can
get a little closer,

00:06:59.259 --> 00:07:00.527
it'd be more accurate.

00:07:01.428 --> 00:07:02.996
We only have 20 minutes left

00:07:03.029 --> 00:07:05.398
until the ISS passes
through the snipe point.

00:07:06.533 --> 00:07:08.902
That's not very long.

00:07:08.935 --> 00:07:10.403
20 minutes, huh?

00:07:11.404 --> 00:07:13.340
That's more than enough for us.

00:07:16.543 --> 00:07:17.511
Huh?

00:07:35.929 --> 00:07:37.697
until we give it a try, right?

00:07:38.398 --> 00:07:39.499
[Izzy] Right.

00:07:39.533 --> 00:07:40.734

Let's do it.

00:07:42.068 --> 00:07:43.036
Sure!

00:07:43.069 --> 00:07:44.171
Be careful out there.

I think we can reach the top,

but we're gonna be
cutting it close, Tai!

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.735
So we have to hurry!

00:08:48.768 --> 00:08:49.736
Mm!

00:09:03.116 --> 00:09:04.417
Okay, let me guess.

00:09:04.451 --> 00:09:06.620

Why isn't the lightning
bothering them?

That form of theirs I
probably a digivolution

that's adapted to the
environment over time.

00:09:43.023 --> 00:09:44.190
You'd have to be
out of your mind

a place like this.

So if you're immune
to lightning,

00:09:53.233 --> 00:09:55.468
it's a perfect feeding ground.

Keep going!

00:11:21.454 --> 00:11:24.290
Just a little bit further
till we reach the top!

Looks like BladeKuwagamon
called his boss.

(Izzy gasping)

00:17:46.422 --> 00:17:47.523
You got this.

00:17:47.557 --> 00:17:48.558
Now go!

00:17:50.093 --> 00:17:51.861
Are you sure?

00:17:51.894 --> 00:17:53.863
Not a doubt in my mind.

00:17:53.896 --> 00:17:55.431
Mm.

00:17:55.465 --> 00:17:57.600
(Izzy grunting)

00:17:57.633 --> 00:17:58.634
Okay!

00:18:00.403 --> 00:18:03.239
All right, let's hit 'em!

00:18:03.272 --> 00:18:06.442
[BlitzGreymon] Thunder Vernier!

00:18:06.476 --> 00:18:08.745
(lightning crackling)

00:18:08.778 --> 00:18:11.080
(somber music)

00:18:11.114 --> 00:18:14.117
(air whooshing)

00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:16.552
(gentle music)

00:18:16.586 --> 00:18:18.454
(Izzy grunting)

00:18:18.488 --> 00:18:20.289
(computer beeping)

00:18:20.323 --> 00:18:22.725
Right then, it's all up to me.

00:18:22.759 --> 00:18:23.993
I'll do it alone.

00:18:25.928 --> 00:18:27.563
Wait a minute.

00:18:27.597 --> 00:18:30.166
(gentle music)

00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:36.139
"I like being alone."

00:18:37.273 --> 00:18:39.175
I always used to
say that to people.

00:18:41.844 --> 00:18:43.412
I was always observing everyone

00:18:43.446 --> 00:18:44.947
from the corner of the class.

00:18:46.315 --> 00:18:48.985
Even when grown-ups were
worried about me, I wasn't.

00:18:50.153 --> 00:18:52.021
I thought I was
better off alone.

00:18:54.791 --> 00:18:59.262
But now, I have you,
MegaKabuterimon.

00:18:59.295 --> 00:19:00.296
And that's not all.

00:19:01.831 --> 00:19:03.432
Thank you for
everything today, Izzy.

00:19:03.466 --> 00:19:06.135
But, I didn't
really do anything.

00:19:06.169 --> 00:19:08.437
Come on, you're the one
who looked everything up.

00:19:08.471 --> 00:19:11.941
You backed us up, you
supported us the whole time.

00:19:11.974 --> 00:19:14.443
The fact is, you saved us.

00:19:14.477 --> 00:19:16.512
You are seriously
awesome, my dude.

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:20.216
(gentle music)

00:19:21.384 --> 00:19:22.618
I have everyone.

00:19:22.652 --> 00:19:25.354
They're all standing by my side.

00:19:25.388 --> 00:19:28.024
(gentle music)

00:19:32.728 --> 00:19:34.330
So I can't back down!

00:19:34.363 --> 00:19:36.866
We're gonna do this
thing for everyone!

00:19:36.899 --> 00:19:38.868
That's the spirit, Izzy!

00:19:38.901 --> 00:19:40.136
This is our moment.

00:19:40.169 --> 00:19:43.472
Maybe the biggest
moment of our lives!

00:19:43.506 --> 00:19:45.141
Are you ready?

00:19:45.174 --> 00:19:48.678
[Izzy] MegaKabuterimon,
prepare to fire!

00:19:49.745 --> 00:19:51.480
(Izzy grunting)

00:19:51.514 --> 00:19:54.817
(Digivice buzzing)

00:19:54.851 --> 00:19:57.587
Eight seconds remaining until
we're in sniping distance.

00:20:00.356 --> 00:20:03.159
(Izzy grunting)

00:20:03.192 --> 00:20:05.828
[MegaKabuterimon] Horn!

00:20:05.862 --> 00:20:07.563
(Izzy grunting)

00:20:07.597 --> 00:20:09.165
(clock beeping)

00:20:09.198 --> 00:20:10.199
Now fire!

00:20:11.033 --> 00:20:16.038
[MetalGreymon] Buster!

00:20:19.208 --> 00:20:22.044
(exploding sound)

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:26.015
(air whooshing)

00:20:26.048 --> 00:20:28.784
(exploding sound)

00:20:30.386 --> 00:20:32.188
What just happened?

00:20:32.221 --> 00:20:33.589
I don't believe it.

00:20:33.623 --> 00:20:36.759
It seems the ISS
changed its trajectory.

00:20:36.792 --> 00:20:38.261
How could that be?

00:20:38.294 --> 00:20:40.930
(air whooshing)

00:20:44.734 --> 00:20:47.570
(water splashing)

00:20:49.605 --> 00:20:51.107
(Izzy gasping)

00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:53.209
(Izzy laughing)
Prodigious!

00:20:53.242 --> 00:20:55.778
(gentle music)

00:20:57.747 --> 00:20:59.882
Not too shabby!

00:20:59.916 --> 00:21:01.584
Way to go, Izzy!

00:21:01.617 --> 00:21:04.053
I knew you could do it!

00:21:04.086 --> 00:21:06.622
(gentle music)

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:12.628
[Male Reporter]
Now, an announcement

00:21:12.662 --> 00:21:14.897
from the Ministry of Defense.

00:21:14.931 --> 00:21:16.565
The International Space Station,

00:21:16.599 --> 00:21:18.467
projected to fall into the city,

00:21:18.501 --> 00:21:23.139
suddenly changed its trajectory
1,000 meters above Odaiba.

00:21:23.172 --> 00:21:27.143
It's fall into the nearby Tokyo
Bay has now been confirmed.

00:21:27.176 --> 00:21:28.744
No casualties have
been reported.

00:21:28.778 --> 00:21:30.313
(all laughing)

00:21:30.346 --> 00:21:32.648
I repeat, the International
Space Station,

00:21:32.682 --> 00:21:35.084
which was projected
to fall into the city,

00:21:35.117 --> 00:21:39.488
suddenly changed its trajectory
1,000 meters above Odaiba.

00:21:40.423 --> 00:21:41.390

This Digimon is

00:22:49.091 --> 00:22:50.326

this cool new form,

00:22:58.601 --> 00:23:02.004
Tentomon keeps mumbling it
being "mighty brilliant!"

00:23:02.038 --> 00:23:04.840
Don't worry, one day you'll
get to shine too, Tentomon!

00:23:04.874 --> 00:23:07.576
(bright music)

00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:09.945
