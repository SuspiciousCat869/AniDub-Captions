[Narrator] In the year 2020 C.E

00:00:15.624 --> 00:00:18.085
the human world is
connected by a network.

00:00:18.878 --> 00:00:22.465
That network is inhabited
by an unknown life form

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.592
called Digimon.

[Narrator] Out of nowhere,

00:02:10.865 --> 00:02:13.534
a cyber terrorism
attack struck Tokyo.

00:02:13.576 --> 00:02:15.870
But that calamity was
merely the beginning

00:02:15.911 --> 00:02:16.871
for Tai Kamiya

00:02:16.912 --> 00:02:19.206
and the mysterious
creatures he discovered

00:02:19.206 --> 00:02:23.377
living within the Network,
creatures known as Digimon.

00:02:23.419 --> 00:02:25.337
Tai teamed up with Agumon,

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:29.174
the Digimon he bonded with,
and with his newfound friends.

00:02:29.216 --> 00:02:31.343
Together, they averted
a crisis caused

00:02:31.385 --> 00:02:34.513
when an unknown Digimon
took over military systems

00:02:34.555 --> 00:02:37.391
and sent a missile
rocketing toward Tokyo.

00:02:37.433 --> 00:02:41.270
In doing so, they saved the
city and all of mankind.

00:02:42.771 --> 00:02:45.190
Their brief digital
adventure came to an end

00:02:45.232 --> 00:02:46.567
shortly afterward.

00:02:50.446 --> 00:02:51.739
They returned to their lives

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.074
as if it had all
been just a dream

00:02:54.116 --> 00:02:56.744
and embarked on a
peaceful summer vacation.

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:02.458
However, disaster
strikes yet again.

00:03:07.755 --> 00:03:11.300
A massive power outage is
spreading throughout Tokyo.

00:03:13.594 --> 00:03:15.930
But the cause
remains unidentified,

00:03:15.971 --> 00:03:20.059
which means that no one can
figure out how to fix it.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.437
Tai and his friends are the
only ones who can stop it.

00:03:24.813 --> 00:03:28.442
Tai wishes with all his heart
and calls out Agumon's name.

00:03:29.777 --> 00:03:32.446
Hoping that they can
fight together once again.

00:03:39.828 --> 00:03:40.788
(upbeat music)

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:42.790
[Tai] It worked! I'm here!

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.583
And, wow! Look at all this!

00:03:44.625 --> 00:03:47.086
Ooh! There's a couple of them!

00:03:47.127 --> 00:03:50.339
And look at that big
guy! He's amazing!

00:03:52.466 --> 00:03:55.094
And what are those
little flying heads?!

00:03:55.135 --> 00:03:58.097
Or those serious
looking dinosaur-things?

00:03:58.138 --> 00:03:59.598
Am I in the Digital World?

00:04:01.684 --> 00:04:04.311
It's just so cool!

00:04:04.353 --> 00:04:06.647
(chuckles)

00:04:09.692 --> 00:04:12.319
I'm glad you're here,
Tai, welcome back!

00:04:13.821 --> 00:04:17.324
Agumon, it's really
good to see you again!

00:04:17.366 --> 00:04:18.367
But, uh...

00:04:20.369 --> 00:04:21.370
Huh?

00:04:22.705 --> 00:04:24.123
Hey, what's the matter?

00:04:24.164 --> 00:04:27.668
The matter's Izzy! Or
actually, that it's not Izzy!

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.295
You see, back in my world
there's another disaster,

00:04:30.337 --> 00:04:32.172
and he should've come along
with me to help stop it.

00:04:32.214 --> 00:04:34.633
[Sora] Why am I stuck in
a bush?! Let go of me!

00:04:34.675 --> 00:04:35.676
Huh?

00:04:36.343 --> 00:04:38.637
(Sora grunting)

00:04:38.679 --> 00:04:39.680
Sora?!

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:43.976
Tai! It's you!

00:04:44.018 --> 00:04:46.020
Do you know what's going on?

00:04:46.061 --> 00:04:49.148
Are we some place
overseas or am I dreaming?

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:51.233
Does your phone work?
Mine won't turn on!

00:04:52.568 --> 00:04:53.527
What's wrong?

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:54.820
I don't get it.

00:04:54.862 --> 00:04:57.531
Sora, why did you show
up here instead of Izzy?

00:04:58.574 --> 00:04:59.825
Izzy?

00:04:59.867 --> 00:05:02.369
That's a funny looking
dog you got there.

00:05:02.369 --> 00:05:04.830
Kinda looks like a dinosaur.

00:05:04.872 --> 00:05:06.373
No, I'm a Digimon!

00:05:06.373 --> 00:05:07.374
(gasps)

00:05:07.374 --> 00:05:08.375
Wait, you can talk?!

00:05:08.375 --> 00:05:10.419
Let me introduce you to Agumon!

00:05:13.422 --> 00:05:15.883
Nice to meet you, Agumon?

00:05:15.924 --> 00:05:18.093
(beeping)

00:05:20.054 --> 00:05:21.055
Huh?

00:05:35.235 --> 00:05:37.404
What is this? Do you know?

00:05:38.072 --> 00:05:39.448
(beeping)

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:48.582
"Children, come to the place

00:05:49.625 --> 00:05:50.834
where the light leads you

00:05:50.876 --> 00:05:52.586
and brings you out
of the darkness."

00:06:00.135 --> 00:06:01.136
Whoa.

00:06:01.804 --> 00:06:03.764
How was I able to read that?

00:06:04.598 --> 00:06:06.809
(whirring)

00:06:20.948 --> 00:06:23.951
I guess that what it's telling
us is to head that way.

00:06:23.992 --> 00:06:25.786
What do we do now, Tai?

00:06:26.787 --> 00:06:30.124
[Tai] Well, maybe that's
where all the answers are.

00:06:30.124 --> 00:06:33.127
Maybe we can find out why
we came to this world;

00:06:33.168 --> 00:06:35.504
why all those problems
are happening back home.

00:06:38.173 --> 00:06:40.300
I don't really get
what's going on here.

00:06:41.301 --> 00:06:42.761
But if there's no other choice,

00:06:42.803 --> 00:06:44.972
then there's no other
choice! We gotta go, right?

00:06:46.348 --> 00:06:47.975
That's true.

00:06:48.016 --> 00:06:50.477
No need to waste time
thinking about the details!

00:06:51.478 --> 00:06:52.646
All right!

00:06:52.646 --> 00:06:55.816
We've been shown the path,
so let's just go and take it!

00:06:55.858 --> 00:06:58.652
(dramatic music)

00:07:04.658 --> 00:07:07.828
I had no idea there were
so many different Digimon!

00:07:07.828 --> 00:07:09.329
Yeah, that guy's Stegomon.

00:07:09.371 --> 00:07:11.456
(foliage rustling)

00:07:11.498 --> 00:07:13.167
Man, he's so huge!

00:07:13.208 --> 00:07:17.004
That's Brachiomon. He's
the strong and silent type.

00:07:18.172 --> 00:07:21.300
Come on, you guys! Less
talking, more walking!

00:07:21.341 --> 00:07:23.552
(rustling)

00:07:25.554 --> 00:07:26.555
Huh?

00:07:27.347 --> 00:07:29.516
(both yelp)

00:07:29.558 --> 00:07:31.185
You really startled me!

00:07:31.226 --> 00:07:33.187
Are you another Digimon?

00:07:35.856 --> 00:07:36.815
Who's that?!

00:07:36.857 --> 00:07:37.816
It's trouble!

00:07:37.858 --> 00:07:40.819
(trilling)

00:07:40.861 --> 00:07:42.863
That guy's called Snimon!

00:07:42.905 --> 00:07:45.365
(whimpering)

00:07:46.909 --> 00:07:48.869
(shrieks)

00:07:48.911 --> 00:07:51.038
Why's he after us all
of a sudden, anyway?!

00:07:51.079 --> 00:07:52.331
Snimon's angry!

00:07:52.372 --> 00:07:54.625
He thinks that we just
stole lunch from him!

00:07:54.666 --> 00:07:56.710
[Tai] Pretty sure he thinks
we'd make a good lunch!

00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:58.712
(panting)

00:07:58.754 --> 00:08:00.923
(shrieks)

00:08:03.217 --> 00:08:05.719
(all screaming)

00:08:05.761 --> 00:08:08.013
(both grunt)

00:08:08.055 --> 00:08:09.014
Ready, Agumon?

00:08:09.056 --> 00:08:10.182
Mm-hmm.

00:08:10.224 --> 00:08:12.351
(shrieks)

00:08:12.392 --> 00:08:13.560
Pepper Breath!

00:08:14.895 --> 00:08:17.022
(upscale action music)

00:08:17.064 --> 00:08:18.899
(whimpers)

00:08:18.899 --> 00:08:21.526
Sora! Go on! Find
somewhere safe!

00:08:21.568 --> 00:08:23.403
We'll deal with
this one ourselves!!

00:08:25.906 --> 00:08:27.908
Come on, tough guy!
That all you got?

00:08:28.408 --> 00:08:29.576
Okay, here he comes!

00:08:35.123 --> 00:08:36.124
Take this!

00:08:41.296 --> 00:08:43.924
(shouting)

00:08:43.966 --> 00:08:46.385
(whimpers)

00:08:46.426 --> 00:08:47.761
Pepper Breath!

00:08:51.765 --> 00:08:54.226
Tai, this is our chance
to escape, come on!

00:08:54.268 --> 00:08:56.311
Okay! You don't have
to ask me twice!

00:08:58.605 --> 00:09:01.733
(Tai gasps)

00:09:01.775 --> 00:09:02.859
(river gurgling)

00:09:07.698 --> 00:09:09.366
[Sora] What do we do now, Tai?!

00:09:12.077 --> 00:09:13.996
I guess we jump!

00:09:14.037 --> 00:09:15.205
Sora, can you do this?

00:09:15.247 --> 00:09:18.542
Yeah! You're coming, too, okay?

00:09:18.583 --> 00:09:20.669
(whimpers)

00:09:20.711 --> 00:09:23.422
(Snimon shrieks)

00:09:28.719 --> 00:09:31.555
(both whimpering)

00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:36.435
(gentle music)

00:09:43.734 --> 00:09:45.902
(shrieks)

00:09:49.906 --> 00:09:51.283
-Achoo!
-Achoo!

00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:58.957
Can't believe we
made it through that!

00:10:02.794 --> 00:10:04.254
Hey, are you two doing okay?

00:10:04.296 --> 00:10:05.547
Yeah!

00:10:05.589 --> 00:10:08.091
We are now, thanks
to you Agumon!

00:10:08.091 --> 00:10:09.259
You guys looked so cool

00:10:09.301 --> 00:10:11.219
fighting against that
thing back there!

00:10:11.261 --> 00:10:12.596
You make a great team.

00:10:12.637 --> 00:10:15.807
(embarrassed chuckle)

00:10:16.933 --> 00:10:17.934
Oh, I see now!

00:10:19.269 --> 00:10:20.562
So this whole time,

00:10:20.604 --> 00:10:22.773
what you and Izzy were
secretly talking about

00:10:22.814 --> 00:10:24.149
was all this Digimon stuff.

00:10:25.442 --> 00:10:28.445
'Course by stuff I mean
amazing incredibleness!

00:10:28.445 --> 00:10:31.114
(sighs) It's unbelievable!

00:10:31.156 --> 00:10:33.575
Who would've thought that
there was a world like this

00:10:33.617 --> 00:10:35.410
inside the Net?

00:10:35.452 --> 00:10:38.121
(Digivice beeps)

00:10:41.333 --> 00:10:42.292
[Tai] Izzy!

00:10:42.334 --> 00:10:45.087
Tai! I'm so glad to see you!

00:10:45.128 --> 00:10:46.588
[Tai] Where are you right now?!

00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:48.632
[Izzy] If I had to guess,
and I guess I have to guess,

00:10:48.673 --> 00:10:51.259
I think I'm in the same
place you wound up last time.

00:10:51.301 --> 00:10:52.260
And you?

00:10:52.302 --> 00:10:53.470
[Tai] It's a place
that's apparently

00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:54.846
called the Digital World.

00:10:55.847 --> 00:10:57.474
There's tons of Digimon here,

00:10:57.474 --> 00:10:59.643
and lots of rocks, plants,
and other nature stuff.

00:10:59.684 --> 00:11:01.478
It feels way different
than our world.

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:03.438
Oh! And Sora's here, too!

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:05.107
Huh?! Sora?!

00:11:05.148 --> 00:11:06.650
Uh, how's it going, Izzy!

00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:07.984
Hi!

00:11:07.984 --> 00:11:10.445
I can't believe
you're here, too!

00:11:10.487 --> 00:11:12.572
Well, start believing!
You're surprised?

00:11:12.614 --> 00:11:13.824
How do you think I feel?!

00:11:13.865 --> 00:11:14.825
[Tentomon] Hello!

00:11:14.866 --> 00:11:15.826
[All] Huh?

00:11:15.867 --> 00:11:17.327
It's a pleasure to meet you.

00:11:17.327 --> 00:11:18.829
I call myself Tentomon!

00:11:18.829 --> 00:11:21.123
Actually, everyone
calls me that!

00:11:21.164 --> 00:11:22.165
What's up, Tentomon?

00:11:22.207 --> 00:11:23.417
So you're Tai?

00:11:23.458 --> 00:11:26.169
As I like to say, a friend of
Izzy's is a friend of mine!

00:11:26.211 --> 00:11:27.504
That's actually the
first time I've said it,

00:11:27.504 --> 00:11:29.172
but I do like it!

00:11:29.214 --> 00:11:30.841
[Izzy] Since I
met Tentomon here,

00:11:30.882 --> 00:11:33.510
I've been able to learn
a lot from him already.

00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:36.012
From what I've been
able to gather so far,

00:11:36.012 --> 00:11:38.306
it seems that what we
call the Digital World

00:11:38.348 --> 00:11:41.351
lies inside the deepest part
of the Network cyberscape.

00:11:41.393 --> 00:11:43.186
But, Tai, back in our world,

00:11:43.228 --> 00:11:45.522
the power outage in
Tokyo keeps spreading,

00:11:45.522 --> 00:11:47.691
just as I expected.

00:11:47.691 --> 00:11:49.192
In less than 72 hours,

00:11:49.234 --> 00:11:51.695
there's going to be
a complete blackout.

00:11:51.695 --> 00:11:54.990
Before the city grinds to a
halt and things turn dangerous,

00:11:55.031 --> 00:11:57.826
we have to identify the
cause and remedy it.

00:11:57.868 --> 00:11:59.035
Got it.

00:11:59.077 --> 00:12:00.871
Right now, we're
heading to a place

00:12:00.912 --> 00:12:02.539
where a secret clue sent us.

00:12:02.539 --> 00:12:05.208
I have a suspicion that we
might be able to find out more

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:06.543
once we get there.

00:12:06.585 --> 00:12:08.044
[Izzy] Understood.

00:12:08.044 --> 00:12:10.505
I believe that
there's a reason why

00:12:10.547 --> 00:12:12.841
all of us were
brought to this world.

00:12:12.883 --> 00:12:16.553
Anyway, if I find anything new,
I'll notify you right away.

00:12:16.553 --> 00:12:18.638
Kay! We're all
counting on you,

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:19.681
See ya.

00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:20.891
Ta-ta for now!

00:12:23.894 --> 00:12:25.061
That ray of light earlier

00:12:25.103 --> 00:12:27.189
was pointing toward that
multi-colored mountain.

00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:29.858
It looks to me like if we
just follow this river,

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:31.234
it'll take us right there.

00:12:32.569 --> 00:12:35.238
But it's gonna take forever
if we try to walk there!

00:12:37.574 --> 00:12:39.034
Oh! That's right!

00:12:39.075 --> 00:12:42.412
Luckily, I was on my way
home from shopping earlier.

00:12:42.454 --> 00:12:44.206
I needed a few
emergency supplies,

00:12:44.247 --> 00:12:46.583
and ended up with enough
to outfit a small army.

00:12:46.625 --> 00:12:49.920
Wow! These things
are just perfect!

00:12:49.961 --> 00:12:51.254
Ha! Found it!

00:12:51.296 --> 00:12:54.925
We'll make a raft and
go rafting! On the raft!

00:12:54.966 --> 00:12:57.594
Ooh! Sounds fantastic!

00:12:57.636 --> 00:12:59.721
Agumon, come give me a hand.

00:12:59.763 --> 00:13:01.056
We gotta saw some wood!

00:13:01.097 --> 00:13:03.391
[Agumon] I already
saw some! Over there!

00:13:03.433 --> 00:13:05.101
[Tai] I see what you did there.

00:13:09.105 --> 00:13:11.066
Oh, you're awake. Huh?

00:13:11.107 --> 00:13:12.108
I'm glad.

00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:13.151
Sora.

00:13:14.653 --> 00:13:16.071
Huh?

00:13:16.112 --> 00:13:17.113
Sora!

00:13:19.282 --> 00:13:23.745
My name's Biyomon. I've
been waiting for you, Sora!

00:13:23.787 --> 00:13:25.288
What? For me?

00:13:34.005 --> 00:13:35.632
The raft's working great!

00:13:35.674 --> 00:13:38.802
I mean, not to toot my
own horn or anything.

00:13:38.843 --> 00:13:39.970
Yeah!

00:13:40.011 --> 00:13:41.471
[Tai] Careful, Agumon!
Don't fall off!

00:13:41.471 --> 00:13:42.681
[Agumon] I'll be fine.

00:13:47.352 --> 00:13:48.812
-Sora.
-Huh?

00:13:48.853 --> 00:13:51.982
I really owe you a big thank
you for saving me earlier.

00:13:51.982 --> 00:13:55.860
It felt so nice and warm
to be cradled in your arms.

00:13:57.028 --> 00:13:59.197
The next time there's
a fight, I'll help!

00:14:00.365 --> 00:14:01.950
That sounds great!

00:14:01.992 --> 00:14:04.619
Maybe you and I can fight
together. What do you say?

00:14:04.661 --> 00:14:05.662
Yeah!

00:14:07.038 --> 00:14:08.999
(gasps)

00:14:08.999 --> 00:14:10.041
[Tai] Rapids ahead.

00:14:12.043 --> 00:14:13.545
Hang on tight, guys!

00:14:14.713 --> 00:14:17.966
(all grunting)

00:14:18.008 --> 00:14:20.010
How's it going back there,
Sora? Everybody good?!

00:14:20.051 --> 00:14:22.887
(both whimpering)

00:14:26.683 --> 00:14:28.685
(yelps)

00:14:31.396 --> 00:14:34.024
Okay, I think the worst is over!

00:14:34.024 --> 00:14:35.859
(gasps)

00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:38.570
(ominous music)

00:14:40.238 --> 00:14:42.699
(both grunt)

00:14:45.076 --> 00:14:46.202
(both chuckle)

00:14:46.244 --> 00:14:48.246
(yelps)

00:14:52.751 --> 00:14:55.045
(exclaims)

00:15:06.264 --> 00:15:07.515
(both sigh)

00:15:07.557 --> 00:15:10.393
Oh, good! It looks
like we're okay now.

00:15:10.435 --> 00:15:12.687
(Both chuckle)

00:15:12.729 --> 00:15:14.939
That was a close one!
Or close couple dozen!

00:15:16.107 --> 00:15:17.067
(gasps)

00:15:17.108 --> 00:15:18.568
It's not over yet, Tai!

00:15:20.111 --> 00:15:23.365
(ominous music)

00:15:23.406 --> 00:15:25.575
There's something coming!

00:15:30.455 --> 00:15:32.624
(shrieks)

00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:34.751
Coelamon!

00:15:36.586 --> 00:15:38.922
(Tai yelps)

00:15:53.603 --> 00:15:56.731
Come on! Why does everything
want to eat us today?!

00:15:56.773 --> 00:15:57.941
Pepper Breath!

00:16:02.153 --> 00:16:04.322
(shrieks)

00:16:08.451 --> 00:16:10.620
(screams)

00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:12.831
Agumon!

00:16:16.626 --> 00:16:17.627
Agumon!

00:16:20.797 --> 00:16:21.798
(beeps)

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:25.135
(upscale action music)

00:16:38.982 --> 00:16:40.984
Agumon digivolve to...

00:16:53.371 --> 00:16:54.372
Greymon!

00:16:56.207 --> 00:16:58.209
(roars)

00:16:59.210 --> 00:17:01.838
(grunts)

00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:03.673
He Digivolved?

00:17:03.715 --> 00:17:05.633
(determined roar)

00:17:05.675 --> 00:17:06.843
Nice one, Greymon!

00:17:10.221 --> 00:17:12.348
(grunts)

00:17:16.895 --> 00:17:19.814
(determined roar)

00:17:19.856 --> 00:17:20.857
Incredible!

00:17:22.025 --> 00:17:22.984
Huh?

00:17:23.026 --> 00:17:25.153
(wings buzzing)

00:17:25.195 --> 00:17:26.196
[Biyomon] Snimon!

00:17:26.196 --> 00:17:28.364

00:17:29.574 --> 00:17:31.367

00:17:37.582 --> 00:17:39.042
Sora!

00:17:39.083 --> 00:17:41.002
Biyomon! No!

00:17:41.044 --> 00:17:42.045
Uh-oh.

00:17:42.921 --> 00:17:46.049
(Biyomon shrieks)

00:17:46.049 --> 00:17:47.425
[Sora] Biyomon!

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:50.887
[Biyomon] Sora?

00:17:50.887 --> 00:17:54.057
Just hold on! I'm
coming to you right now!

00:17:55.934 --> 00:17:57.560
(grunts)

00:17:57.602 --> 00:18:00.396
No, Sora, please
don't! It's dangerous!

00:18:00.396 --> 00:18:01.940
No way! Don't you give up!

00:18:02.941 --> 00:18:04.234
Don't you remember?

00:18:04.275 --> 00:18:06.569
We said that we were
gonna fight together!

00:18:06.611 --> 00:18:09.405
Well, I'm not about
to give up on that.

00:18:09.447 --> 00:18:11.574
So that means you can't either!

00:18:11.616 --> 00:18:12.617
Oh, Sora!

00:18:13.743 --> 00:18:16.538
(wings buzzing)

00:18:16.579 --> 00:18:18.790
(grunting)

00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:21.626
Spiral Twister!

(shrieks)

00:18:25.922 --> 00:18:27.549
Sora, no!

00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:28.925
Biyomon! Help!

00:18:41.938 --> 00:18:43.982
Biyomon digivolve to...

00:18:45.775 --> 00:18:48.945
(upscale action music)

00:18:54.826 --> 00:18:57.120
(both grunting)

00:18:57.161 --> 00:18:58.621
Wait, that's...

00:19:01.833 --> 00:19:04.127
(gasps)

00:19:04.168 --> 00:19:05.169
Birdramon!

00:19:06.504 --> 00:19:11.342
Whoa, Biyomon! You just
digivolved, too! Into Birdramon!

00:19:14.804 --> 00:19:19.642
Sora, your warm heart gave
me the power I needed.

00:19:19.642 --> 00:19:22.478
Now I'll fight
alongside you, too!

00:19:27.150 --> 00:19:29.319

Birdramon, go!

00:19:45.168 --> 00:19:46.836
Hang on tight, Sora!

00:19:46.878 --> 00:19:48.880
[Sora] You bet I will!

00:19:59.349 --> 00:20:00.516
Meteor Wing!

00:20:06.356 --> 00:20:08.524

00:20:21.037 --> 00:20:22.080

(triumphant roar)

00:20:48.231 --> 00:20:49.399
Wait, what?

00:20:49.399 --> 00:20:50.400
Agumon?!

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:51.901
I guess that once I calmed down,

00:20:51.943 --> 00:20:53.611
I just changed right back.

00:20:55.446 --> 00:20:58.074
Way to go, Birdramon,
you were awesome!

00:20:58.074 --> 00:21:00.868
It's all thanks to you.

00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:02.078
(laughs)

00:21:02.078 --> 00:21:04.080
Birdramon's right!
You did great, Sora!

00:21:05.957 --> 00:21:06.916
(gasps)

00:21:06.958 --> 00:21:08.418
Hey, look!

00:21:08.418 --> 00:21:11.421
Isn't that the place where that
beam of light was pointing?!

00:21:11.421 --> 00:21:15.091
It looks like there's something
in front of the mountain.

00:21:15.133 --> 00:21:17.927
(dramatic music)

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:25.184
Is that some kind of a temple?

00:21:25.226 --> 00:21:28.062
[Birdramon] If we go now, I
can use my power of flight

00:21:28.104 --> 00:21:31.274
to take everyone there.
Come on, let's hurry!

00:21:31.315 --> 00:21:33.776
[Tai] Hey, what if you turn
into Biyomon in midair?

00:21:33.818 --> 00:21:35.737
[Agumon] Well you won't
