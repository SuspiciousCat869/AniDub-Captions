Sounds frightening.

Every night, he
stalks the locals and

attacks them with
a deadly sword.

00:07:17.041 --> 00:07:21.279
And as soon as the light comes,
he vanishes into thin air.

00:07:21.312 --> 00:07:23.181
The villagers did
form defense teams

00:07:23.214 --> 00:07:26.083
to fight him off, but their
numbers dropped even more.

how hard you try,

straight through him.

busy until morning.

get right back to you.

00:11:02.776 --> 00:11:06.079
(rockets exploding)

00:11:06.113 --> 00:11:07.581
That was a close one!

00:11:11.285 --> 00:11:14.254
We ran over as soon
as Izzy filled us in.

00:11:14.288 --> 00:11:15.389
This guy's no joke.

00:11:24.898 --> 00:11:27.734
(whistle blowing)

00:11:29.936 --> 00:11:33.540
Hey. The two of you okay?

00:11:33.573 --> 00:11:35.609
(Tai groaning)

00:11:35.642 --> 00:11:37.944
(Agumon groaning)

00:11:37.978 --> 00:11:39.379
(Matt groaning)

00:11:39.413 --> 00:11:40.714
Where'd Zanbamon go?

00:11:40.747 --> 00:11:42.115
Looks like he's gone.

00:11:42.149 --> 00:11:43.250
For now, anyway.

00:11:44.151 --> 00:11:45.252
But you're still here.

00:11:45.285 --> 00:11:47.554
I can't believe all of you
lasted through the night.

00:11:47.587 --> 00:11:49.122
[Tai] Yeah, barely.

00:11:49.156 --> 00:11:51.825
(metal banging)

00:11:56.663 --> 00:11:59.733
(WereGarurumon growling)

00:11:59.766 --> 00:12:01.301
We were fighting for so long

00:12:01.335 --> 00:12:02.736
and we almost had him.

00:12:02.769 --> 00:12:05.906
Then the sun came up
and ruined it all!

00:12:05.939 --> 00:12:08.442
Next thing we knew, he
was nothing but air.

00:12:08.475 --> 00:12:10.310
So in the end, we
might as well have been

00:12:10.344 --> 00:12:12.612
punching at shadows
through the night.

00:12:12.646 --> 00:12:14.081
Big guy didn't have any problems

00:12:14.114 --> 00:12:15.349
whaling on us, though.

00:12:16.483 --> 00:12:17.451
How awful.

00:12:17.484 --> 00:12:19.186
Is there no way to beat him?

00:12:20.687 --> 00:12:22.322
(sad guitar music)

00:12:22.356 --> 00:12:25.625
I've done some investigating
on our mysterious swordsman.

00:12:25.659 --> 00:12:28.095
According to my research,
a long time ago,

00:12:28.128 --> 00:12:30.564
a huge battle happened
in your region.

00:12:30.597 --> 00:12:31.998
The records are a bit vague,

00:12:32.032 --> 00:12:33.433
but based on the descriptions,

00:12:33.467 --> 00:12:35.135
I'd say one of the
generals leading

00:12:35.168 --> 00:12:36.970
the charge was
probably Zanbamon.

00:12:37.938 --> 00:12:39.606
And the opposing army was led by

00:12:39.639 --> 00:12:41.641
a sword-wielding knight.

00:12:41.675 --> 00:12:44.044
That warrior was
covered in golden armor.

00:12:45.312 --> 00:12:46.947
Golden armor.

00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:47.981
Unusual.

00:12:50.984 --> 00:12:53.453
After a final duel
between the two generals,

00:12:53.487 --> 00:12:55.522
the sword fighter in gold one.

00:12:55.555 --> 00:12:59.359
However, Zanbamon's
weapon remained intact

00:12:59.393 --> 00:13:01.161
and continued to haunt
the battlegrounds

00:13:01.194 --> 00:13:03.063
in the form of an evil curse.

00:13:04.398 --> 00:13:07.100
So the golden sword fighter
decided to stay behind

00:13:07.134 --> 00:13:08.535
and use his opponent's soul to

00:13:08.568 --> 00:13:10.704
seal the curse away for good.

00:13:10.737 --> 00:13:13.173
But at some point, it
must've broken free.

00:13:13.206 --> 00:13:16.042
If we could find the place where
the curse was first sealed,

00:13:16.076 --> 00:13:19.212
it might give us a clue about
how we can take out Zanbamon.

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:22.349
Keep an eye out
for a golden soul.

00:13:22.382 --> 00:13:23.817
Seems straightforward.

00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:25.819
(Strabimon sighing)

00:13:25.852 --> 00:13:27.020
Tell them, Strabimon.

00:13:28.722 --> 00:13:30.891
You happen to know
where we can find it?

00:13:32.259 --> 00:13:33.827
I can take you.

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:35.429
Not that it makes a difference.

00:13:36.596 --> 00:13:38.031
We could really use any leads

00:13:38.064 --> 00:13:39.499
you could give us right now

00:13:39.533 --> 00:13:41.283
or else more of
you might get hurt!

00:13:44.144 --> 00:13:45.996
(Strabimon sighing)

00:13:49.975 --> 00:13:50.976
Let's hurry!

00:13:52.678 --> 00:13:54.980
We have to make our way
back before nightfall!

00:13:59.351 --> 00:14:01.120
[Garurumon] There's
a canyon ahead.

00:14:01.153 --> 00:14:02.621
Could that be it?

00:14:02.655 --> 00:14:05.324
(mysterious horn music)

00:14:05.357 --> 00:14:07.459
Well, here we are.

00:14:07.493 --> 00:14:10.329
This is the site where
Zanbamon was sealed away.

00:14:12.164 --> 00:14:14.200
In other words, the
first village to be

00:14:14.233 --> 00:14:16.202
decimated in that
awful thing's wake.

00:14:19.171 --> 00:14:21.207
This was once my home.

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:24.176
(sad violin music)

00:14:33.852 --> 00:14:35.387
But after the seal was broken,

00:14:35.421 --> 00:14:36.822
what happened to the soul of the

00:14:36.855 --> 00:14:39.325
Digimon who tried
to stop the curse?

00:14:39.358 --> 00:14:42.194
(sad flute music)

00:14:46.232 --> 00:14:47.499
You're looking right at it.

00:14:47.533 --> 00:14:49.902
That's what's left of
the golden warrior.

00:14:49.935 --> 00:14:52.605
You mean his soul was in
the weapon he was using?

00:14:53.772 --> 00:14:56.408
Well, the power
of the sword lost

00:14:56.442 --> 00:14:58.944
and Zanbamon's perseverance won.

00:15:00.379 --> 00:15:02.081
You understand now?

00:15:02.114 --> 00:15:04.516
There's no way for us
to stop it anymore.

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:06.118
The wild curse won!

00:15:07.286 --> 00:15:09.054
[Garurumon] I'm gonna stop it.

00:15:10.122 --> 00:15:11.757
Do you even hear yourself?

00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:14.193
What are you gonna do
with that piece of junk?

00:15:14.226 --> 00:15:16.428
[Garurumon] Something
I saw in a dream.

00:15:16.462 --> 00:15:18.197
You'll see!

00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:19.398
Are you serious?

00:15:20.566 --> 00:15:22.368
[Garurumon] You've
gotta trust me, Matt.

00:15:22.401 --> 00:15:26.071
This weapon, I know it
was calling out for me!

00:15:26.105 --> 00:15:27.740
[Matt] If that's what you want.

00:15:27.773 --> 00:15:28.774
All right, then.

00:15:29.808 --> 00:15:31.377
[Strabimon] You
can't be serious!

00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:32.378
[Matt] Come on.

00:15:32.411 --> 00:15:33.579
We better get going.

00:15:33.612 --> 00:15:35.447
[Strabimon] But
aren't you afraid?

00:15:35.481 --> 00:15:36.615
Fear doesn't matter.

00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:39.952
Not once we've
made up our minds.

00:15:39.985 --> 00:15:43.489
(intense orchestra music)

00:15:54.333 --> 00:15:57.603
(ominous horn blowing)

00:15:59.838 --> 00:16:02.074
(Zanbamon growling)

00:16:02.107 --> 00:16:04.576
[MetalGreymon] Giga Storm!

00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:06.478
(rockets exploding)

00:16:06.512 --> 00:16:10.015
(intense orchestra music)

00:16:22.528 --> 00:16:25.130
(wolf howling)

00:16:26.165 --> 00:16:29.635
[Garurumon] Garurumon,
digivolve to!

00:16:29.668 --> 00:16:33.172
(intense orchestra music)

00:16:35.341 --> 00:16:36.975
(dog barking)

00:16:37.009 --> 00:16:40.512
(intense orchestra music)

00:16:45.384 --> 00:16:48.053
[WereGarurumon] WereGarurumon!

00:16:52.324 --> 00:16:54.827
(Tai gasping)

00:16:56.829 --> 00:16:58.197
Thanks for waiting up!

00:16:59.665 --> 00:17:01.633
(Zanbamon growling)

00:17:01.667 --> 00:17:03.836
(WereGarurumon yelling)

00:17:03.869 --> 00:17:05.337
(Zanbamon growling)

00:17:05.371 --> 00:17:08.040
(metal banging)

00:17:13.846 --> 00:17:18.851

-(WereGarurumon yelling)

00:17:20.252 --> 00:17:22.254

00:17:27.893 --> 00:17:31.363
(WereGarurumon growling)

00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:37.770
(Matt growling)

00:17:41.273 --> 00:17:44.243
(suspenseful music)

00:17:44.276 --> 00:17:45.277
Matt, no!

00:17:48.881 --> 00:17:51.784
(Zanbamon growling)

00:17:53.051 --> 00:17:56.555

(Matt growling)

00:18:19.244 --> 00:18:23.248
(singing in Japanese)

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:30.722
(Matt gasping)

00:18:30.756 --> 00:18:35.761
-(Tai gasping)
-(MetalGreymon gasping)

00:18:36.428 --> 00:18:37.596
WereGarurumon!

00:18:37.629 --> 00:18:39.264
[WereGarurumon] On it!

00:18:39.298 --> 00:18:43.469
(singing in Japanese)

00:18:44.503 --> 00:18:46.305
I can feel the power!

00:18:51.477 --> 00:18:54.346
(digivice beeping)

00:18:56.348 --> 00:19:00.519
(singing in Japanese)

00:19:13.499 --> 00:19:18.136
[WereGarurumon]
WereGarurumon digivolve to!

00:19:27.813 --> 00:19:29.781
[CresGarurumon] CresGarurumon!

00:19:29.815 --> 00:19:30.782
Whoa!

00:19:30.816 --> 00:19:32.618
That's so awesome!

00:19:32.651 --> 00:19:33.852
His armor.

00:19:33.886 --> 00:19:34.887
It's gold!

00:19:35.888 --> 00:19:39.892
(singing in Japanese)

00:19:52.538 --> 00:19:55.541
(Zanbamon growling)

00:19:56.842 --> 00:20:01.013
(singing in Japanese)

00:20:15.694 --> 00:20:18.697
(Zanbamon growling)

00:20:29.608 --> 00:20:32.377
(metal scraping)

00:20:38.951 --> 00:20:41.086
(Strabimon gasping)

00:20:41.119 --> 00:20:44.590
(triumphant violin music)

00:20:48.794 --> 00:20:50.762
You've given us
hope for the future,

00:20:50.796 --> 00:20:52.431
and for that we thank you.

00:20:52.464 --> 00:20:54.866
Now we've seen the
gold sword fighter

00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:58.203
and witnessed its techniques
with our own eyes.

00:20:58.236 --> 00:20:59.338
Glad you did,

00:20:59.371 --> 00:21:01.607
though I don't remember much
of what happened myself.

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:03.075
You convinced me.

00:21:03.108 --> 00:21:04.610
It's about trusting yourself

00:21:04.643 --> 00:21:06.278
and pushing through your fear.

00:21:06.311 --> 00:21:08.213
That's what the soul
of the golden warrior

00:21:08.246 --> 00:21:09.615
was responding to.

00:21:09.648 --> 00:21:11.116
How very insightful.

00:21:12.317 --> 00:21:14.786
You know, it's time
we all got stronger.

00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:16.455
We'll follow your example.

00:21:16.488 --> 00:21:18.724
Just like the gold
sword fighter,

00:21:18.757 --> 00:21:20.626
we'll unlock our inner warrior.

00:21:24.496 --> 00:21:26.732
Wisemon said to follow
our crests, right?

00:21:26.765 --> 00:21:27.933
If you ask me,

00:21:27.966 --> 00:21:30.068
seems Matt and Gabumon
just found theirs.

00:21:30.102 --> 00:21:31.903
Guess we'd better
not slack off, then.

00:21:31.937 --> 00:21:33.071
Right?

00:21:33.105 --> 00:21:35.841
