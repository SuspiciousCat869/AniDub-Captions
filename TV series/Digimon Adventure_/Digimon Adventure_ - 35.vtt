00:10:34.263 --> 00:10:36.099
[Control Room B]
We can't specify!

00:10:37.834 --> 00:10:39.135
Oh no.

00:10:39.168 --> 00:10:40.737
(Izzy sighing)

00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:43.339
(ship bubbling)

00:10:52.315 --> 00:10:54.417
[Kari] Gatomon?

00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:56.953
-(sad violin music)
-Yes.

00:10:56.986 --> 00:10:58.121
I am Gatomon.

00:10:59.789 --> 00:11:03.426
And I am the Celestial Digimon.

00:11:05.461 --> 00:11:08.931
(Agumon chomping)

00:11:08.965 --> 00:11:10.933
But if I'm to fulfill that role,

00:11:10.967 --> 00:11:13.269
if I'm to prevail in
the battles ahead,

00:11:13.302 --> 00:11:15.838
I must be like everyone else.

00:11:15.872 --> 00:11:18.708
I must digivolve further
and become stronger.

00:11:20.376 --> 00:11:23.446
That surge in power
I felt earlier,

00:11:23.479 --> 00:11:25.815
it must've been a sign
I should digivolve.

00:11:27.383 --> 00:11:29.118
But I found I couldn't do it.

00:11:30.987 --> 00:11:32.688
For fear...

00:11:32.722 --> 00:11:36.893
You see, the fact is,
I'm afraid to digivolve.

00:11:38.494 --> 00:11:42.865
I still remember,
long, long ago.

00:11:42.899 --> 00:11:46.135
I fought and defeated
Millenniummon

00:11:46.169 --> 00:11:50.206
and I did so in exchange
for my own life.

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:54.377
The puppet used to
resurrect Millenniummon,

00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:57.413
Skullnightmon, and AxeKnightmon,

00:11:58.414 --> 00:12:00.082
that puppet was me.

00:12:02.084 --> 00:12:06.989
I was trapped within that
shell of cold, black armor.

00:12:07.023 --> 00:12:09.592
But still, AxeKnightmon was me

00:12:10.593 --> 00:12:12.361
and I was AxeKnightmon.

00:12:13.696 --> 00:12:15.731
There was no doubt
that destructive drive

00:12:15.765 --> 00:12:17.567
and desire for
darkness within him

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:20.436
existed just as powerfully
within me as well.

00:12:22.705 --> 00:12:24.240
But I can't shake the feeling.

00:12:25.708 --> 00:12:29.078
Even now, after I've been
released from the darkness,

00:12:29.111 --> 00:12:32.448
what if a shard of evil
remains inside my heart?

00:12:33.916 --> 00:12:38.387
If it grows and tried to
swallow my mind and body,

00:12:39.288 --> 00:12:40.790
then I will once again...

00:12:42.291 --> 00:12:45.228
(Gatomon growling)

00:12:48.431 --> 00:12:52.535
-(mysterious music)
-Wow!

00:12:52.568 --> 00:12:55.271
Hey, Tai, we're out
of the cave now.

00:12:55.304 --> 00:12:57.707
-(door squeaking)
-Yo Gatomon, Kari,

00:12:57.740 --> 00:12:58.875
better get back inside.

00:12:58.908 --> 00:13:00.109
We're gonna resurface.

00:13:04.413 --> 00:13:06.282
Gatomon.

00:13:06.315 --> 00:13:09.118
(dramatic music)

00:13:09.986 --> 00:13:11.721
[Kari] Something's coming.

00:13:11.754 --> 00:13:14.924
(uneasy guitar music)

00:13:20.496 --> 00:13:22.632
(group gasping)

00:13:22.665 --> 00:13:26.002
(Komondomon whimpering)

00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:38.147
(suspenseful orchestra music)

00:13:43.352 --> 00:13:44.820
(Gatomon gasping)

00:13:44.854 --> 00:13:46.689
[Greymon] Nova Blast!

00:13:49.191 --> 00:13:50.826
Gatomon, are you all right?

00:13:51.794 --> 00:13:52.762
Yeah.

00:13:52.795 --> 00:13:54.597
But where's Kari?

00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:55.765
I don't know!

00:13:55.798 --> 00:13:57.767
I keep trying her,
but she won't respond!

00:13:57.800 --> 00:13:59.502
We gotta hurry up and find her!

00:13:59.535 --> 00:14:00.636
[Sora] Tai!

00:14:02.672 --> 00:14:03.639
(Birdramon yelling)

00:14:03.673 --> 00:14:04.640
[Tai] Sora!

00:14:04.674 --> 00:14:05.841
Birdramon!

00:14:05.875 --> 00:14:08.277
Me and Pegasusmon are here, too!

00:14:08.311 --> 00:14:09.512
[Sora] Who's with you?

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:13.482
I've got Greymon
and Gatomon with me.

00:14:13.516 --> 00:14:14.951
But Kari's missing!

00:14:14.984 --> 00:14:16.352
(TK gasping)

00:14:16.385 --> 00:14:17.453
(Sora gasping)

00:14:17.486 --> 00:14:19.522
(Komondomon howling)

00:14:19.555 --> 00:14:21.724
Komondomon can't take
much more of this!

00:14:25.161 --> 00:14:26.662
Wait a minute.

00:14:26.696 --> 00:14:28.164
[Tai] No doubt about it.

00:14:28.197 --> 00:14:29.865
That's the source
of power that made

00:14:29.899 --> 00:14:31.834
Ebidramon digivolve!

00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:35.538
[Patamon] The
Digimon that attacked

00:14:35.571 --> 00:14:38.874
the underwater city must've
been born here, too.

00:14:38.908 --> 00:14:40.543
Kari.

00:14:40.576 --> 00:14:42.044
(Gatomon sighing)

00:14:42.078 --> 00:14:43.879
(alarm ringing)

00:14:43.913 --> 00:14:45.147
(Gatomon gasping)

00:14:45.181 --> 00:14:46.182
This way!

00:14:46.749 --> 00:14:48.017
Gatomon, wait!

00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:49.885
[Sora] Tai, you look for Kari!

00:14:49.919 --> 00:14:51.053
Right.

00:14:51.087 --> 00:14:52.054
Let's go!

00:14:52.088 --> 00:14:53.389
[Greymon] You got it!

00:14:53.422 --> 00:14:54.423
Kari!

00:14:58.227 --> 00:14:59.695
I'm coming, Kari!

00:15:00.596 --> 00:15:01.564
Come on!

00:15:01.597 --> 00:15:02.898
We gotta hurry!

00:15:02.932 --> 00:15:04.400
-(Tai growling)
-(Greymon growling)

00:15:04.433 --> 00:15:05.668
Aw, come on!

00:15:05.701 --> 00:15:07.003
Careful!

00:15:07.036 --> 00:15:09.572
This whole area is
overflowing with dark energy!

00:15:13.109 --> 00:15:15.111
What on Earth is that?

00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:20.716
(Marindevimon growling)

00:15:21.617 --> 00:15:23.019
Kari, no!

00:15:23.052 --> 00:15:27.790
-(intense orchestra music)
-(Gatomon growling)

00:15:34.563 --> 00:15:35.598
I knew it!

00:15:35.631 --> 00:15:37.233
Millenniummon's shard!

00:15:37.266 --> 00:15:39.435
It wants Kari and me!

00:15:39.468 --> 00:15:42.905
(Gatomon growling)

00:15:42.938 --> 00:15:46.409
(intense orchestra music)

00:15:48.978 --> 00:15:49.979
Perfect timing.

00:15:55.151 --> 00:15:56.152
Kari!

00:15:57.753 --> 00:15:58.988
Are you okay?

00:16:01.257 --> 00:16:03.092
Yeah, I'm all right.

00:16:03.125 --> 00:16:04.760
Glad to hear it.

00:16:04.794 --> 00:16:07.096
(Gatomon growling)

00:16:07.129 --> 00:16:08.931
How dare you.

00:16:08.964 --> 00:16:12.301
(Marindevimon growling)

00:16:13.169 --> 00:16:15.638
Gatomon, what are you doing?

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:18.741
We gotta go after her!

00:16:18.774 --> 00:16:19.775
On it!

00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:24.447
(Gatomon growling)

00:16:28.184 --> 00:16:29.151
(Greymon gasping)

00:16:29.185 --> 00:16:30.786
Gatomon!

00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:33.756
(Gatomon yelling)

00:16:33.789 --> 00:16:36.692
(Gatomon groaning)

00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:42.298
Gatomon, wait!

00:16:43.365 --> 00:16:46.836
(intense orchestra music)

00:16:49.305 --> 00:16:51.140
Greymon, stand down.

00:16:55.377 --> 00:16:59.215
You shall not...interfere.

00:17:00.382 --> 00:17:03.886
(intense orchestra music)

00:17:15.498 --> 00:17:18.367
(Greymon groaning)

00:17:22.571 --> 00:17:24.373
[Kari] Gatomon, no!

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:35.568
[Gatomon] Kari?

00:17:44.143 --> 00:17:45.144
Gatomon.

00:17:49.782 --> 00:17:52.117
Gatomon, it's okay.

00:17:52.151 --> 00:17:54.453
(Gatomon groaning)

00:17:54.487 --> 00:17:58.390
-(sad piano music)
-Don't worry.

00:17:58.424 --> 00:18:01.594
When you feel scared,
whenever you do,

00:18:03.462 --> 00:18:06.265
just call for me
and I'll be there.

00:18:06.298 --> 00:18:09.134
(sad piano music)

00:18:10.002 --> 00:18:12.938
You'll always have me, Gatomon.

00:18:12.972 --> 00:18:15.241
I'll rescue you every time.

00:18:15.274 --> 00:18:18.344
(bright piano music)

00:18:24.116 --> 00:18:25.284
I promise you.

00:18:26.285 --> 00:18:27.453
It'll be okay.

00:18:29.955 --> 00:18:33.025
Yes, I have...I have Kari.

00:18:33.993 --> 00:18:37.129
(bright piano music)

00:18:38.030 --> 00:18:41.333
It's Kari who will light my way

00:18:43.469 --> 00:18:45.871
as she guides me
out of the darkness.

00:18:47.139 --> 00:18:48.140
The light.

00:18:50.709 --> 00:18:51.710
Of course!

00:18:53.979 --> 00:18:54.980
That's why your name

00:18:57.149 --> 00:18:58.150
is Hikari.

00:19:00.986 --> 00:19:04.056
(bright piano music)

00:19:06.492 --> 00:19:09.795

-(Kari gasping)

(Tai gasping)

00:19:11.997 --> 00:19:15.334
(Marindevimon growling)

00:19:16.168 --> 00:19:17.469
All right.

00:19:17.503 --> 00:19:18.904
I will not be afraid.

00:19:19.905 --> 00:19:20.906
Never again.

00:19:21.907 --> 00:19:23.242
The way is clear.

00:19:24.209 --> 00:19:25.477
Now with your help, Kari,

00:19:25.511 --> 00:19:28.180
I can finally unleash
my full power!

00:19:28.213 --> 00:19:29.181
Yes.

00:19:29.214 --> 00:19:30.883
Show 'em what you got.

00:19:30.916 --> 00:19:34.086
(inspirational music)

00:19:36.855 --> 00:19:38.857
Gatomon, digivolve to!

00:19:40.359 --> 00:19:43.228
(victorious music)

00:20:00.713 --> 00:20:02.715
[Angewomon] Angewomon!

00:20:04.617 --> 00:20:06.785
Ange what now?

00:20:11.056 --> 00:20:14.093
(Kari gasping)

00:20:14.126 --> 00:20:17.062
(triumphant music)

00:20:18.964 --> 00:20:20.966
Angewomon, together...

00:20:21.934 --> 00:20:23.268
We will fight.

00:20:27.072 --> 00:20:28.273
Heaven's Charm!

00:20:31.744 --> 00:20:32.945
Kari.

00:20:32.978 --> 00:20:33.979
Right!

00:20:35.648 --> 00:20:37.149
Celestial Arrow!

00:20:40.586 --> 00:20:45.491
-(Marindevimon growling)
-(victorious music)

00:20:58.504 --> 00:21:02.908
And you, distortion born
of Millenniummon's shard,

00:21:02.941 --> 00:21:03.942
be gone!

00:21:04.677 --> 00:21:07.613
(victorious music)

00:21:19.825 --> 00:21:22.995

[Izzy] Tai!

00:21:27.666 --> 00:21:28.667
Can you hear me?

00:21:29.134 --> 00:21:31.003
I think I've found a way to stop

00:21:31.036 --> 00:21:32.471
the space station's fall.

00:21:33.972 --> 00:21:35.274
But I'll need your help.

00:21:35.307 --> 00:21:36.809
And we haven't got much time.
