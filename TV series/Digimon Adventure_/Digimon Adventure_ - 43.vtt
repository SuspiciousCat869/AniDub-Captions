00:01:52.717 --> 00:01:55.137
the bringer of destruction.

00:01:55.137 --> 00:01:58.849
And now they're headed
toward the Sealed Grounds.

00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:59.891
However...

00:02:01.184 --> 00:02:02.978
[Gatomon] Something's not right.

(Kari gasping)

What's going on, Gatomon?

00:02:06.022 --> 00:02:07.649
[Gatomon] This
landscape isn't the same

00:02:07.691 --> 00:02:09.317
as the one in my memory.

00:02:10.068 --> 00:02:11.862
I thought we were
on the correct path

00:02:11.903 --> 00:02:14.197
to the Sealed Grounds
following my memories,

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:17.492
but it seems the materialization
of human objects,

00:02:17.492 --> 00:02:19.828
alongside the effects
of the black lightning

00:02:19.828 --> 00:02:23.331
are changing the landscape
of the continent itself.

00:02:23.373 --> 00:02:24.833
How is that even possible?

00:02:24.833 --> 00:02:27.335
So basically, you don't
know where we are,

00:02:27.335 --> 00:02:29.212
which means we're lost, right?

00:02:29.254 --> 00:02:32.507
And I have no memory of this
river being here either.

00:02:32.507 --> 00:02:33.884

00:07:41.816 --> 00:07:42.817
Agumon?

00:07:42.817 --> 00:07:43.818
Something's weird, Tai.

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:44.819
I can't stop!

00:07:44.861 --> 00:07:47.197
(Agumon roaring)

00:07:47.238 --> 00:07:48.990
(Tai yelling)
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot!

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:51.159
(Biyomon yelling)

00:07:51.201 --> 00:07:52.160
What's going on?

00:07:52.202 --> 00:07:53.995
I don't know, but I can't stop!

00:07:54.037 --> 00:07:57.165
-(Mimi trembling)
-Mimi.

00:07:57.207 --> 00:07:58.208
Mimi.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.001
What?

00:08:01.419 --> 00:08:03.004
Why are you using
Marching Fishes

00:08:03.046 --> 00:08:05.215
at a time like this?

00:08:05.256 --> 00:08:08.676
I don't know either, Joe!

00:08:08.676 --> 00:08:10.845
(Gatomon meowing)

00:08:10.845 --> 00:08:12.055
(Gatomon hissing)

00:08:12.096 --> 00:08:14.057
(Gatomon meowing)

00:08:14.098 --> 00:08:15.350
[Kari] Gatomon?

00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:19.020
(Patamon groaning)

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:20.021
[TK] Patamon!

00:08:20.063 --> 00:08:21.064
Come back!

00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:23.691
Gabumon?

00:08:25.193 --> 00:08:26.194
(Matt gasping)

00:08:26.194 --> 00:08:28.071
Where'd you go, buddy?

00:08:28.112 --> 00:08:29.113
Gabumon!

00:08:30.532 --> 00:08:32.450
Tentomon, are you
feeling all right?

00:08:34.619 --> 00:08:36.037
[Tentomon] Eh?

00:08:36.037 --> 00:08:37.038
I'm sorry.

00:08:37.038 --> 00:08:39.249
Don't you know who I am?

00:08:39.290 --> 00:08:40.416
Say what?

00:08:40.458 --> 00:08:42.585
Hey, you stay out of this!

00:08:42.627 --> 00:08:43.711
What did you say?

00:08:43.711 --> 00:08:45.129
Something's
definitely not right.

00:08:46.047 --> 00:08:47.549
Does this sound have anything

00:08:47.549 --> 00:08:49.259
to do with these anomalies?

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:52.804
(upbeat electronic music)

00:08:57.392 --> 00:08:58.393
What is that?

00:08:58.393 --> 00:08:59.394
[Volcamon] Vol-ca!

00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:01.938
Muscles!
Please!

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:02.981
Vol-ca!

00:09:03.731 --> 00:09:04.732
Vol-ca!

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:07.068
-(Tai gasping)
-Vol-ca!

00:09:07.068 --> 00:09:08.570
What is happening?

00:09:08.611 --> 00:09:10.780
I don't know, but
I don't like it!

00:09:10.822 --> 00:09:13.741
Let me captivate
you with my music!

00:09:13.741 --> 00:09:17.996
-(record scratching)
-Enter-tainment!

00:09:21.833 --> 00:09:23.960
If the King is I,
then I am King!

00:09:24.002 --> 00:09:25.003
Vol-ca!

00:09:25.753 --> 00:09:26.754
Vol-ca!

00:09:27.922 --> 00:09:31.259
(sound waves exploding)

00:09:33.177 --> 00:09:35.430
-(Agumon roaring)
-(Tai gasping)

00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:36.598
I figured it out!

00:09:36.639 --> 00:09:38.975
The sound waves emitted
by those two Digimon

00:09:39.017 --> 00:09:41.144
are what's causing
all this commotion.

00:09:41.185 --> 00:09:42.979
They're interfering
and affecting

00:09:43.021 --> 00:09:44.981
all of the data in the vicinity.

00:09:45.023 --> 00:09:46.774
The sound waves?

00:09:46.774 --> 00:09:48.985
Yeah. See everyone
acting so weird?

00:09:49.027 --> 00:09:50.653
I think that's the reason.

00:09:50.695 --> 00:09:51.654
(Etemon panting)

00:09:51.696 --> 00:09:52.822
All right.

00:09:52.864 --> 00:09:54.949
(Volcamon panting)

00:09:54.949 --> 00:09:57.118
Etemon and Volcamon.

00:09:57.118 --> 00:09:59.120
They're both Ultimate Digimon.

00:09:59.162 --> 00:10:00.997
Huh? Wait a second.

00:10:01.039 --> 00:10:02.165
Who are you guys?

00:10:02.206 --> 00:10:03.958
[Volcamon] I've never seen 'em.

00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:06.294
Oh, well, you see,
we're actually...

00:10:06.336 --> 00:10:07.670
-Oh!
-(group gasping)

00:10:07.712 --> 00:10:09.172
I know you!

00:10:09.213 --> 00:10:11.132
You guys are the
Digi-destined, huh?

00:10:11.132 --> 00:10:12.133
What?

00:10:12.133 --> 00:10:13.509
Is it really them?

00:10:13.551 --> 00:10:14.636
(Tai trembling)

00:10:14.636 --> 00:10:15.970
Oh wow.

00:10:16.012 --> 00:10:18.306
Looks like we're well-known,
for better or worse.

00:10:18.306 --> 00:10:20.141
The Digi-destined continue their

00:10:20.183 --> 00:10:21.768
journey as they
pulverize whoever

00:10:21.809 --> 00:10:23.186
and whatever stands
in their way.

00:10:23.227 --> 00:10:25.647
And rumor has it that
no one is strong enough

00:10:25.647 --> 00:10:27.315
to survive an
encounter with them!

00:10:27.357 --> 00:10:29.359
Until now.

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:31.027
That's what they say?

00:10:31.069 --> 00:10:32.320
It's all true!

00:10:32.362 --> 00:10:35.156
It means if I defeat
you super famous kids,

00:10:35.156 --> 00:10:36.824
then everyone will
have no choice

00:10:36.824 --> 00:10:38.326
but to acknowledge yours truly

00:10:38.326 --> 00:10:40.161
as the true King of Digimon!

00:10:40.203 --> 00:10:41.704
That settles it!

00:10:41.746 --> 00:10:44.165
Whoever defeats them is
the true King of Digimon!

00:10:44.165 --> 00:10:45.166
How's that?

00:10:45.917 --> 00:10:48.044
Not a bad idea at all.

00:10:48.086 --> 00:10:49.879
I'm gonna turn you to dust

00:10:49.921 --> 00:10:52.006
'cause I'll be the
one defeating you!

00:10:52.048 --> 00:10:54.008
Well, you see, we
don't have time

00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:55.343
to be fighting pointless bat-

00:10:55.343 --> 00:10:56.678
-Silence!
-(group gasping)

00:10:56.719 --> 00:11:00.765
And bear witness to me, the
King of Digimon, Etemon!

00:11:02.016 --> 00:11:04.018
(group screaming)

00:11:04.018 --> 00:11:07.063
There's only one King of
Digimon and that's me!

00:11:07.105 --> 00:11:08.106
Volcamon!

00:11:09.774 --> 00:11:12.652
(group screaming)

00:11:20.827 --> 00:11:23.079
(rumbling)

00:11:23.913 --> 00:11:25.623
(Etemon laughing)

00:11:25.665 --> 00:11:26.666
Victory!

00:11:28.584 --> 00:11:30.169
Is everybody still okay?

00:11:30.211 --> 00:11:31.713
Kinda.

00:11:31.754 --> 00:11:32.714
Hey Tai.

00:11:32.755 --> 00:11:34.340
We should retreat for now.

00:11:34.382 --> 00:11:35.508
I think you're right.

00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:37.885
Okay, Agumon, let's hold
those two off for the others.

00:11:37.927 --> 00:11:39.137
[Agumon] You got it, Tai!

00:11:39.178 --> 00:11:40.221
Let's do it!

00:11:40.263 --> 00:11:42.181
(victorious music)

00:11:42.223 --> 00:11:43.850
Agumon digivolve to!

00:11:45.601 --> 00:11:47.395
[Greymon] Greymon!

00:11:47.437 --> 00:11:48.438
Nova!

00:11:49.856 --> 00:11:51.190
Well, Biyomon?

00:11:52.692 --> 00:11:55.903
[Biyomon] Biyomon digivolve to!

00:11:55.945 --> 00:11:57.947
[Birdramon] Birdramon!

00:12:00.074 --> 00:12:01.659
[Sora] Birdramon?

00:12:01.701 --> 00:12:03.661
[Birdramon] Sora, I can't stop!

00:12:03.703 --> 00:12:05.413
(Birdramon yelping)

00:12:05.455 --> 00:12:06.664
What's wrong, Greymon?

00:12:06.706 --> 00:12:07.707
I bit my tongue.

00:12:08.541 --> 00:12:10.251
[Etemon] You're mine!

00:12:10.293 --> 00:12:13.212
-(Etemon yelling)
-(Greymon growling)

00:12:13.254 --> 00:12:14.505
(Volcamon growling)

00:12:14.547 --> 00:12:16.007
Sorry about this birdie,

00:12:16.048 --> 00:12:19.218
but it's time for
you to fly high!

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.429
(Birdramon yelling)

00:12:21.471 --> 00:12:22.680
Birdramon!

00:12:22.722 --> 00:12:25.850
(descending whistling)

00:12:25.892 --> 00:12:27.101
Biyomon?

00:12:27.143 --> 00:12:28.102
Tentomon?

00:12:28.144 --> 00:12:29.103
[Tentomon] Take this!

00:12:29.145 --> 00:12:30.104
Take that!

00:12:30.146 --> 00:12:31.105
Had enough?

00:12:31.147 --> 00:12:32.106
-Gabumon?
-Never!

00:12:32.148 --> 00:12:33.733
-Where are you?
-Never, never!

00:12:33.775 --> 00:12:35.026
Ready, Gomamon?

00:12:35.067 --> 00:12:38.279
Gomamon digivolve to!

00:12:38.321 --> 00:12:40.114
[Ikkakumon] Ikkakumon!

00:12:40.156 --> 00:12:43.367
Harpoon Torpedo!

00:12:43.409 --> 00:12:44.535
What?

00:12:44.577 --> 00:12:46.287
(Ikkakumon yelling)

00:12:46.329 --> 00:12:49.457
Why is it chasing me?

00:12:49.499 --> 00:12:51.709
(Joe yelling)

00:12:51.751 --> 00:12:52.710
[Ikkakumon] Joe!

00:12:52.752 --> 00:12:54.086
(Ikkakumon yelling)

00:12:54.128 --> 00:12:55.421
Oh, Joe!

00:12:55.463 --> 00:12:57.465
Patamon, wake up!

00:12:57.507 --> 00:12:58.508
Patamon!

00:13:00.009 --> 00:13:01.010
Oh no.

00:13:02.428 --> 00:13:05.723
Palmon, you just swallowed
Patamon, didn't you?

00:13:05.765 --> 00:13:08.392
No! I didn't, I promise!

00:13:08.434 --> 00:13:09.602
Jeez!

00:13:09.644 --> 00:13:13.064
These Kings of Digimon
sure are annoying!

00:13:13.105 --> 00:13:14.315
It's worth a shot.

00:13:14.357 --> 00:13:15.316
Greymon!

00:13:15.358 --> 00:13:18.986
(Greymon growling)
Paws crossed.

00:13:19.028 --> 00:13:22.990
Greymon digivolve to!

00:13:23.032 --> 00:13:25.785
[Metalgreymon] Metalgreymon!

00:13:25.827 --> 00:13:26.994
All right!

00:13:27.036 --> 00:13:28.621
Metalgreymon, how
you holding up?

00:13:28.663 --> 00:13:30.832
Good to go.

00:13:30.873 --> 00:13:31.999
Giga Blaster!

00:13:33.626 --> 00:13:35.127
It's party time!

00:13:37.046 --> 00:13:39.674
(upbeat music)

00:13:41.551 --> 00:13:42.718
Bring it on!

00:13:46.639 --> 00:13:47.849
Muscle!

00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:48.891
Here we go!

00:13:51.853 --> 00:13:53.521
(Tai groaning)

00:13:53.563 --> 00:13:54.689
[Metalgreymon] One more time!

00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:55.690
Giga...

00:13:55.731 --> 00:13:57.275
Blaster!

00:13:57.316 --> 00:13:58.276
[Tai] Agumon?

00:13:58.317 --> 00:13:59.277
Huh?

00:13:59.318 --> 00:14:00.903
[Tai] Are you okay?

00:14:00.945 --> 00:14:02.613
This never happens
to me, I swear.

00:14:02.655 --> 00:14:03.865
Oh man.

00:14:03.906 --> 00:14:06.033
They might be weird, but
they're super strong!

00:14:06.075 --> 00:14:07.451
[Matt] Gabumon!

00:14:07.493 --> 00:14:08.953
Is this some kind of joke?

00:14:08.995 --> 00:14:10.288
You guys are trash!

00:14:10.329 --> 00:14:12.540
Yeah. This is no good.

00:14:12.582 --> 00:14:14.500
We can't prove who's better
against these chumps.

00:14:14.542 --> 00:14:16.419
Now hold it right there you two!

00:14:17.837 --> 00:14:21.674
Your incredible song and
your incredible muscles,

00:14:21.716 --> 00:14:24.051
both of them are fantastic!

00:14:24.093 --> 00:14:26.971
We were blown away and
just had to come tell you!

00:14:27.013 --> 00:14:28.222
Mimi?

00:14:28.264 --> 00:14:30.975
Just go along with it!

00:14:31.017 --> 00:14:32.226
That's right!

00:14:32.268 --> 00:14:34.395
We thought you were
both just lovely!

00:14:34.437 --> 00:14:35.646
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

00:14:35.688 --> 00:14:38.149
Finally, someone
with good taste.

00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:39.817
You understand
the muscle hustle!

00:14:39.859 --> 00:14:41.027
Uh huh!

00:14:41.068 --> 00:14:43.571
So anyway, what's
all this about?

00:14:43.613 --> 00:14:46.157
You know, all this being
the King of Digimon stuff?

00:14:46.198 --> 00:14:47.825
Come on!
Tell us!

00:14:47.867 --> 00:14:49.035
(Volcamon shivering)

00:14:49.076 --> 00:14:50.995
It all goes back
to one dark truth.

00:14:51.037 --> 00:14:53.456
Ya see, in this world where
the strongest survive,

00:14:53.497 --> 00:14:55.166
the weak are all but destined to

00:14:55.207 --> 00:14:57.251
eventually become
the strong's prey.

00:14:57.293 --> 00:14:59.170
Those were the days
when I was weak.

00:14:59.211 --> 00:15:00.254
Everyone made fun of me.

00:15:00.296 --> 00:15:02.381
They'd go out of their
way to pick on me

00:15:02.423 --> 00:15:04.133
and call me names,
like weakling.

00:15:05.551 --> 00:15:07.470
So I knew I had to change.

00:15:08.471 --> 00:15:09.931
Stronger.

00:15:09.972 --> 00:15:12.308
I had to become stronger!

00:15:13.809 --> 00:15:16.562
[Volcamon] I trained,
and trained, and trained!

00:15:17.772 --> 00:15:20.358
I trained as much as
my body would allow!

00:15:20.399 --> 00:15:22.944
[Etemon] And now,
everyone acknowledges me

00:15:22.985 --> 00:15:26.447
as one of the toughest
Digimon there is!

00:15:26.489 --> 00:15:30.034
But I continued to
train my body endlessly.

00:15:30.076 --> 00:15:31.577
And after some time,

00:15:31.619 --> 00:15:35.164
we had become entities that
rivaled all other Digimon!

00:15:37.083 --> 00:15:38.376
However...

00:15:38.417 --> 00:15:40.836
Only one can be crowned
as the King of Digimon.

00:15:40.878 --> 00:15:43.798
So there has to be some
kind of way to settle it!

00:15:43.839 --> 00:15:46.384
Just sit back and
enjoy the show you two

00:15:46.425 --> 00:15:50.471
because I'm about to show
you the best...entertainment!

00:15:50.513 --> 00:15:55.518

You okay?

00:16:24.005 --> 00:16:24.964
Good idea.

00:16:25.006 --> 00:16:26.173
Pitting them up
against one another

00:16:26.215 --> 00:16:27.925
was pretty clever thinking.

00:16:27.967 --> 00:16:29.260
Yeah, I thought so too.

00:16:29.301 --> 00:16:31.679
But this is getting to
be way out of control!

00:16:31.721 --> 00:16:33.472

Only a true king could do this!

Palmon?

00:17:06.047 --> 00:17:08.424
Can't you see we're
busy here, little girls?

00:17:08.466 --> 00:17:10.217
Unless you wanna challenge us?

00:17:10.259 --> 00:17:11.761
Bring it on, chumps.

Oh, I get it.

00:17:51.092 --> 00:17:53.302
It's an irregular digivolve
caused by the sound waves,

00:17:53.344 --> 00:17:55.387
the same ones that caused
the anomalies earlier.

through my muscles!

Well, senor?

00:18:25.793 --> 00:18:28.462
Can you keep up with
Ponchomon's groovy moves?

00:18:28.504 --> 00:18:29.839
What's this?

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:32.675

But how?

00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:52.403
The sound waves created
from Ponchomon's rhythm

00:18:52.444 --> 00:18:53.863
are so strong that they're able

00:18:53.904 --> 00:18:55.656
to cancel out

a performance in my life.

00:20:16.487 --> 00:20:17.696
I beg of you.

00:20:17.738 --> 00:20:20.199
Please form a duo
with me, Ponchomon.

00:20:20.241 --> 00:20:21.408
No way.

00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:23.118
With that excellent
agility of yours,

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:24.578
you should be
polishing those awesome

00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:26.372
skills with someone like me!

00:20:26.413 --> 00:20:27.790
Get off of me, Volcamon!

00:20:27.831 --> 00:20:28.791
You're too heavy!

00:20:28.832 --> 00:20:29.875
You're gonna crush me!

00:20:29.917 --> 00:20:31.043
(Etemon groaning)

00:20:31.085 --> 00:20:33.212
Sorry, but we're already a duo.

-Ponchomon.
-Come on!

00:20:37.633 --> 00:20:39.927
[Tentomon] Well,
you see, I was...

00:20:39.969 --> 00:20:40.928
(Izzy chuckling)

00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:42.304
I'll see myself out.

00:20:42.346 --> 00:20:44.473
I couldn't find you
anywhere, Gabumon.

00:20:44.515 --> 00:20:45.474
Where were you?

00:20:45.516 --> 00:20:47.726
(Gabumon grunting)

-(bright piano music)
-(Tentomon groaning)

00:20:56.443 --> 00:20:57.820
[Gatomon] A map?

00:20:57.861 --> 00:21:00.155
Is it a map of
the area we're in?

00:21:00.197 --> 00:21:01.824
Sure looks like it.

00:21:01.865 --> 00:21:02.950
[Izzy] What's this?

00:21:03.826 --> 00:21:04.827
[Joe] It changed!

00:21:04.868 --> 00:21:05.828
(Gatomon gasping)

00:21:05.869 --> 00:21:07.121
[Gatomon] This landscape!

00:21:07.162 --> 00:21:09.665
This is exactly what I remember!

00:21:09.707 --> 00:21:11.583
It's able to scan
the surrounding land

00:21:11.625 --> 00:21:12.793
and create a map?

00:21:12.835 --> 00:21:15.421
Not to mention, it comes with
images from the past too?

00:21:15.462 --> 00:21:17.172
Check it out!
Cool, huh?

00:21:17.214 --> 00:21:18.173
You bet.

00:21:18.215 --> 00:21:19.633
It's a treasure,
that's for sure.

00:21:19.675 --> 00:21:21.760
If we take this
map and compare it

00:21:21.802 --> 00:21:23.470
to the landscape
in my memories...

00:21:23.512 --> 00:21:26.515

[Izzy Voiceover] Next up on
the Digimon Encyclopedia is...

00:22:43.759 --> 00:22:45.010
Golemon.

00:22:45.052 --> 00:22:48.305
This Digimon is made up
of over 90% rock data.

00:22:48.347 --> 00:22:50.015
The hot gas emitted
from his body

00:22:50.057 --> 00:22:51.725
can be used for attacks, too.

00:22:52.976 --> 00:22:54.853
Now check out this fun fact.

00:22:54.895 --> 00:22:57.439
Golemon's body is kind
of like a knitted sweater

00:22:57.481 --> 00:23:00.109
where the rocks are
weaved by wires.

00:23:00.150 --> 00:23:02.861
Wait. Can wires be
woven into sweaters?

00:23:02.903 --> 00:23:04.530
A wire sweater would be awesome!

00:23:04.571 --> 00:23:07.282
(triumphant music)

00:23:07.324 --> 00:23:09.618
Which Digimon will
it be next time?

00:23:10.828 --> 00:23:12.371
[Narrator] Petaldramon
is injured,

00:23:12.413 --> 00:23:15.207
but does everything to
keep moving forward.

00:23:15.249 --> 00:23:18.710
Kari and Petaldramon's
hearts resonate as one.

00:23:18.752 --> 00:23:19.711
[Tai Voiceover] Next time,

00:23:19.753 --> 00:23:21.463
"Kari and the Moving Forest."

00:23:21.505 --> 00:23:24.258
[Narrator] The adventure
continues in a new world.
