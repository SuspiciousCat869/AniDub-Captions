This is the mysterious world

where Digimon live,
the digital world.

00:01:46.662 --> 00:01:48.631
Tai and the other Digi-destined,

00:01:48.664 --> 00:01:50.800
along with their
Digimon partners,

00:01:50.833 --> 00:01:54.637
continue their quest to prevent
the revival of Milenniummon,

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.507
the bringer of
destruction and darkness.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.877
And so they head for
the Sealed grounds.

00:02:05.848 --> 00:02:08.484
Meanwhile, fighting
alongside TK,

00:02:08.518 --> 00:02:10.486
Patamon gains more
and more power

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.857
as the Celestial Digimon
destined to save the world.

00:02:16.225 --> 00:02:18.227
And now the two
of them are about

00:02:18.261 --> 00:02:20.897
to be put to the ultimate test.

00:02:26.102 --> 00:02:28.738
Talk about a bumpy ride.

00:02:28.771 --> 00:02:31.207
We should really get
some seat belts in here.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.342
Mm, I'm getting car sick,

00:02:33.376 --> 00:02:35.845
I mean, getting Komondomon-sick.

00:02:35.878 --> 00:02:37.046
Uh.

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:38.581
You holding up
all right Patamon.

00:02:38.614 --> 00:02:39.682
Just fine.

00:02:39.715 --> 00:02:40.750
You all right, Joe?

00:02:40.783 --> 00:02:42.218
You're not looking so hot.

00:02:42.251 --> 00:02:43.853
Oh, I'll be okay.

00:02:43.886 --> 00:02:45.087
Ugh.

00:02:45.121 --> 00:02:46.756
-Not in here.
-Not in here.

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:49.192
Why don't you step outside
and look at the scenery.

00:02:49.225 --> 00:02:50.359
Yeah, that's right.

00:02:50.393 --> 00:02:51.727
You'll feel much better.

00:02:51.761 --> 00:02:54.063
Ugh, okay, I'll try that.

00:02:56.065 --> 00:02:58.467
(Joe groans)

00:03:01.137 --> 00:03:04.440
Look at that, what a
beautiful full moon.

00:03:04.473 --> 00:03:07.210
Wait, why is the moon out?

00:03:07.243 --> 00:03:10.146
And why... why is it green?

00:03:12.582 --> 00:03:14.450
(Joe screams)

00:03:14.483 --> 00:03:17.753
(gentle ominous music)

00:03:19.088 --> 00:03:23.626
Sakkakumon No. 6, now returning
and transmitting report.

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:26.395
The Digi-destined located.

00:03:26.429 --> 00:03:27.797
The likelihood they'll

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:31.901
successfully reach the
Sealed grounds, confirmed.

00:03:31.934 --> 00:03:35.905
Initiating Forced
Data Collection mode.

00:03:35.938 --> 00:03:38.007
Initiating, initiating.

00:03:44.981 --> 00:03:46.616
I'm not seeing anything.

00:03:46.649 --> 00:03:47.650
Hmm.

00:03:49.785 --> 00:03:51.420
That's really weird.

00:03:51.454 --> 00:03:54.090
I swear there was a
big round green thing.

00:03:54.123 --> 00:03:56.259
Maybe you just imagined it.

00:03:56.292 --> 00:03:58.327
No, I'm sure I saw it.

00:03:58.361 --> 00:04:03.366
Of course, I wasn't feeling a
hundred percent at the time.

00:04:04.133 --> 00:04:06.836
(everyone screams)

00:04:08.337 --> 00:04:09.972
That's it, that's the thing.

00:04:10.006 --> 00:04:12.174
Quick, everyone
inside Komondomon!

00:04:12.208 --> 00:04:15.444
(Tai panting)

00:04:15.478 --> 00:04:18.347
(everyone screams)

00:04:21.317 --> 00:04:24.186
(Komondomon howls)

00:04:33.162 --> 00:04:34.864
Tai, come back

00:04:34.897 --> 00:04:35.898
Kari!

00:04:45.741 --> 00:04:47.677
Hey, you're crushing me

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.145
My bad.

00:04:49.178 --> 00:04:50.379
Oh, that hurt.

00:04:50.413 --> 00:04:53.349
TK, are you doing okay?

00:04:53.516 --> 00:04:54.650
I think so.

00:04:54.684 --> 00:04:56.018
But what about Patamon?

00:04:56.052 --> 00:04:57.687
-(Matt chuckles)
-Huh?

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:58.921
Oh, I'm fine.

00:05:01.691 --> 00:05:03.392
Well, Izzy?

00:05:03.426 --> 00:05:05.895
Seems like that tractor
beam has deposited us

00:05:05.928 --> 00:05:09.598
into some kind of chamber
within the sphere.

00:05:16.572 --> 00:05:18.507
(Komondomon howls)

00:05:18.541 --> 00:05:19.575
Come in,

00:05:19.608 --> 00:05:21.077
Tai, are you there

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:23.079
Matt, Izzy, anyone?

00:05:23.112 --> 00:05:24.347
Come in, please.

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:27.216
Holy jeez, what is that thing?

00:05:27.249 --> 00:05:29.852
Sakkakumon, a Digimon
with a body composed

00:05:29.885 --> 00:05:32.021
of ten separate spheres.

00:05:32.054 --> 00:05:34.357
And that's one of them.

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:37.026
Tai and the others,
what happened to them?

00:05:37.059 --> 00:05:39.228
That giant eye swallowed them.

00:05:39.261 --> 00:05:41.063
It just ate them.

00:05:41.097 --> 00:05:42.064
No, it didn't.

00:05:42.098 --> 00:05:43.265
They should still be okay.

00:05:43.299 --> 00:05:44.784
Huh?

00:05:48.537 --> 00:05:51.340
Sakkakumon generally
just captures Digimon,

00:05:51.374 --> 00:05:54.877
and holds them inside
one of it's spheres.

00:06:02.885 --> 00:06:04.854
(Agumon grunts)

00:06:04.887 --> 00:06:07.023
Watch out Agumon.

00:06:07.056 --> 00:06:08.858
(Snimon screams)

00:06:08.891 --> 00:06:11.560
(Agumon groans)

00:06:12.995 --> 00:06:14.130
Wasn't that

00:06:14.163 --> 00:06:15.731
looked like Snimon.

00:06:20.336 --> 00:06:21.971
Uh, Coelamon?

00:06:22.004 --> 00:06:25.207
Blue Blaster (roars)

00:06:29.912 --> 00:06:32.681
Dokugumon's here, too?

00:06:32.715 --> 00:06:37.319
Yeah, but there's something
weird about them, isn't there?

00:06:37.353 --> 00:06:38.320
(Tentomon groans)

00:06:38.354 --> 00:06:40.222
I'll just be over here.

00:06:42.591 --> 00:06:45.594
Oh, look, they've
got us surrounded.

00:06:49.598 --> 00:06:51.067
Tankmon?

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:52.935
Oh, and Tylomon too!

00:06:56.105 --> 00:06:57.406
[Gatomon] Sakkakumon
forces Digimon

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.408
to fight until they collapse

00:06:59.442 --> 00:07:02.378
and then collects and
absorbs their battle data.

00:07:02.411 --> 00:07:03.579
I guess you could say

00:07:03.612 --> 00:07:06.415
that's the way
Sakkakumon feeds itself.

00:07:06.449 --> 00:07:08.417
Forces them to fight.

00:07:09.785 --> 00:07:13.089
[Gatomon] Sakkakumon does
not fight, but only observes.

00:07:13.122 --> 00:07:15.758
Copies of the captured
Digmon's previous opponents

00:07:15.791 --> 00:07:18.194
are created from
their battle memories,

00:07:18.227 --> 00:07:21.063
and these copies
attack their prey.

00:07:21.097 --> 00:07:22.531
[Izzy] These things
have been copied

00:07:22.565 --> 00:07:25.701
from data of enemies
we've faced before.

00:07:25.734 --> 00:07:28.070
They're different
from actual Digimon,

00:07:28.104 --> 00:07:33.109
they're somewhere between a
real entity and a virtual image.

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:35.878
So what you're saying is,

00:07:35.911 --> 00:07:37.746
they're all just
a bunch of fakes.

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:40.549
Well, fakes or not
there's sure a lot of 'em.

00:07:40.583 --> 00:07:42.952
We need to find a way
outta here, and fast.

00:07:42.985 --> 00:07:43.986
Oh yeah.

00:07:44.987 --> 00:07:46.589
Agumon digivolve to

00:07:46.622 --> 00:07:47.890
Gabumon digivolve to

00:07:47.923 --> 00:07:49.825
Tentomon digivolve to

00:07:51.594 --> 00:07:52.595
Greymon!

00:07:53.929 --> 00:07:54.930
Garurumon!

00:07:56.999 --> 00:07:58.167
Kabuterimon!

00:07:59.001 --> 00:07:59.969
Patamon?

00:08:00.002 --> 00:08:01.837
Patamon digivolve to

00:08:02.938 --> 00:08:03.939
Angemon!

00:08:06.275 --> 00:08:07.243
(Tai grunts)

00:08:07.276 --> 00:08:08.310
Nova Blast!

00:08:10.813 --> 00:08:12.314
Howling Blaster!

00:08:15.017 --> 00:08:16.752
Electro Shocker!

00:08:16.785 --> 00:08:19.688
(Coelamon explode)

00:08:21.023 --> 00:08:24.260
(wind wooshing)

00:08:24.293 --> 00:08:26.862
(Digimon roar)

00:08:32.868 --> 00:08:34.103
(Tai grunts)

00:08:34.136 --> 00:08:35.137
Orgemon!

00:08:37.373 --> 00:08:40.342
(Greymon grunts)

00:08:40.376 --> 00:08:43.379
(Electronic chimes)

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:49.051
Greymon!

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:53.656
Greymon digivolve to

00:09:03.332 --> 00:09:04.567
Metalgreymon!

00:09:09.171 --> 00:09:12.241
(electronic buzzing)

00:09:15.377 --> 00:09:16.378
Garurumon!

00:09:18.914 --> 00:09:20.916
Garurumon digivolve to

00:09:25.221 --> 00:09:28.357
(electronic beeping)

00:09:29.258 --> 00:09:30.593
Weregarurumon!

00:09:31.594 --> 00:09:34.163
(Digimon explode)

00:09:34.196 --> 00:09:36.065
Hard to tell how tough they are.

00:09:36.098 --> 00:09:38.867
They don't stick
around long enough.

00:09:38.901 --> 00:09:40.569
(electronic buzzing)

00:09:40.603 --> 00:09:43.239
-Huh.
-(bright energetic music)

00:09:43.272 --> 00:09:46.375
[Kabuterimon] Oh,
I remember you.

00:09:46.408 --> 00:09:48.911
You ready to do this?

00:09:48.944 --> 00:09:51.213
Kabuterimon digivolve to

00:09:53.382 --> 00:09:54.883
MegaKabuterimon!

00:09:57.786 --> 00:10:01.123
(MegaKabuterimon roars)

00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:16.538
Sakkakumon's ten
spheres are sent out

00:10:16.572 --> 00:10:20.042
from the Sealed grounds to
every corner of the continent.

00:10:20.075 --> 00:10:23.112
They collect data from
the most powerful Digimon.

00:10:23.145 --> 00:10:26.081
The goal is to
revive Millenniumon.

00:10:27.149 --> 00:10:28.584
It's a different kind of plan

00:10:28.617 --> 00:10:31.120
than the one Kari and I
were once involved in.

00:10:31.153 --> 00:10:33.622
It's goal is to create
the ultimate body

00:10:33.656 --> 00:10:37.793
by bringing together data
from all sorts of Digimon.

00:10:37.826 --> 00:10:40.796
This data accumulated by
Sakkakumon will eventually merge

00:10:40.829 --> 00:10:43.799
at the Sealed grounds
and become one entity.

00:10:43.832 --> 00:10:47.469
So Sakkakumon attacked us
in order to do what now?

00:10:47.503 --> 00:10:49.471
In order to destroy an enemy

00:10:49.505 --> 00:10:51.907
and steal their data
at the same time.

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:53.475
It's as simple as that.

00:10:53.509 --> 00:10:55.778
(Piyomon, Gomamon
and Palmon scream)

00:10:55.811 --> 00:10:57.813
(everyone gasps)

00:10:57.846 --> 00:11:00.249
-(everyone screams)
-(Komondomon howls)

00:11:00.282 --> 00:11:01.650
(explosion booms)

00:11:01.684 --> 00:11:06.689
-(Tai grunts)
-(ominous music)

00:11:11.794 --> 00:11:12.761
(electricity crackles)

00:11:12.795 --> 00:11:14.797
(WereGarurumon groans)

00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:15.998
(electricity crackles)

00:11:16.031 --> 00:11:18.133
(MetalGreymon groans)

00:11:18.167 --> 00:11:19.768
(electricity crackles)

00:11:19.802 --> 00:11:21.770
-(MegaKabuterimon groans)
-(Izzy groans)

00:11:21.804 --> 00:11:25.040
(electricity crackles)

00:11:26.508 --> 00:11:28.010
Are you hurt TK?

00:11:28.043 --> 00:11:29.178
No, I'm fine.

00:11:29.211 --> 00:11:31.113
Thanks Angemon.

00:11:31.146 --> 00:11:33.782
And how about everyone else?

00:11:33.816 --> 00:11:36.852
(electronic crackle)

00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:42.991
Huh?

00:11:52.201 --> 00:11:55.070
(foreboding music)

00:12:08.083 --> 00:12:09.084
Not Devimon!

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:13.422
Greetings old friend.

00:12:14.923 --> 00:12:16.525
(TK gasps)

00:12:16.558 --> 00:12:19.361
(Angemon grunts)

00:12:22.898 --> 00:12:26.902
This one seems different
somehow from the other fakes.

00:12:26.935 --> 00:12:29.271
You bear a curse, Angemon.

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:36.078
And the name of that curse
is the Digi-destined.

00:12:36.111 --> 00:12:39.381
(electricity crackles)

00:12:40.282 --> 00:12:41.884
Curse?

00:12:41.917 --> 00:12:46.522
You are the celestial Digimon,
born with great powers.

00:12:46.555 --> 00:12:48.257
If you would only
forget your mission

00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:52.928
and use those powers freely,
you could rule the world.

00:12:52.961 --> 00:12:56.432
Instead, those powers and
digivolutions have been confined

00:12:56.465 --> 00:13:00.202
to the use of that
existence known as humans.

00:13:00.235 --> 00:13:03.405
If that isn't a curse, what is?

00:13:03.439 --> 00:13:07.042
Neither TK nor any of
these children is a curse.

00:13:07.075 --> 00:13:09.812
(Angemon grunts)

00:13:11.079 --> 00:13:12.781
Careful Angemon!

00:13:12.815 --> 00:13:16.919
-Giga Storm!
-(suspenseful music)

00:13:22.157 --> 00:13:24.293
Jeez, there's no
end to these guys.

00:13:24.326 --> 00:13:25.894
(air whooshing)

00:13:25.928 --> 00:13:28.764
(Digimon explode)

00:13:30.299 --> 00:13:32.234
They just keep coming.

00:13:32.267 --> 00:13:35.504
(electricity crackles)

00:13:36.338 --> 00:13:40.142
(WereGarurumon grunts)

00:13:40.175 --> 00:13:42.010
TK, can you hear me?

00:13:44.279 --> 00:13:45.814
Wing Blade!

00:13:45.848 --> 00:13:47.816
Flower Cannon!

00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:49.351
Vulcan's Hammer!

00:13:50.519 --> 00:13:51.954
Heaven's Charm!

00:13:52.955 --> 00:13:54.156
(digital beeps)

00:13:54.189 --> 00:13:57.025
(explosion roars)

00:13:58.026 --> 00:14:01.263
Was that Metalgreymon's
Giga Storm?

00:14:01.296 --> 00:14:03.966
(digital beeps)

00:14:03.999 --> 00:14:07.002
Weregarurumon's Wolf Claw!

00:14:07.035 --> 00:14:10.906
Sakkakumon is starting to
learn everyone's powers.

00:14:10.939 --> 00:14:12.341
You mean this thing's just going

00:14:12.374 --> 00:14:14.476
to get stronger and stronger?

00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:16.178
I can't tell if we
should be fighting

00:14:16.211 --> 00:14:17.846
in full power or not.

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:22.593
I just hope everyone
inside that thing is okay.

00:14:26.238 --> 00:14:29.308
(explosions booming)

00:14:31.577 --> 00:14:35.881
Why is Devimon so fixated
on Angemon anyway?

00:14:35.914 --> 00:14:37.716
(Devimon laughs)

00:14:37.749 --> 00:14:40.452
(Angemon groans)

00:14:44.823 --> 00:14:46.291
(Agemon gasps)

00:14:46.325 --> 00:14:49.094
(Angemon groans)

00:14:50.596 --> 00:14:51.763
Angemon, no!

00:14:58.437 --> 00:15:01.106
Don't worry, I won't lose!

00:15:01.139 --> 00:15:03.909
I cannot afford to lose.

00:15:03.942 --> 00:15:07.646
This battle is between
me and myself.

00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:09.915
Huh?

00:15:09.948 --> 00:15:13.619
Devimon, with each
time you and I clash,

00:15:13.652 --> 00:15:17.122
my faded memories are
gradually restored.

00:15:19.324 --> 00:15:21.827
At the end of the ancient war,

00:15:23.362 --> 00:15:26.164
when I awoke after
being badly wounded,

00:15:26.198 --> 00:15:30.636
I found myself swallowed up
by a swamp of dark miasma.

00:15:30.669 --> 00:15:34.006
Infested with darkness,
my powers faded.

00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:38.010
As I lay in pain for
what seemed an eternity,

00:15:38.043 --> 00:15:40.345
it was born before my eyes.

00:15:41.546 --> 00:15:43.815
The devil with black wings.

00:15:45.317 --> 00:15:49.888
Come, join the darkness,
that is your only salvation.

00:15:50.889 --> 00:15:53.725
(Angemon screams)

00:15:55.494 --> 00:15:57.462
You are my shadow.

00:15:57.496 --> 00:15:59.898
My shadow cast onto darkness.

00:16:02.367 --> 00:16:05.704
You are a distortion
born from my weakness.

00:16:05.737 --> 00:16:09.141
That is why you so
desperately pursue power,

00:16:09.174 --> 00:16:11.677
and why you have
been consumed by it.

00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:14.212
That is the reason
you were destroyed.

00:16:14.246 --> 00:16:17.382
You're wrong, I'm
indestructible.

00:16:17.416 --> 00:16:21.720
As long as you live, I will
return again and again.

00:16:21.753 --> 00:16:24.323
The rise of your power
has given me the ability

00:16:24.356 --> 00:16:28.026
to assume a physical
body once more.

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:29.695
Heaven's Knuckle!

00:16:32.698 --> 00:16:35.534
(Angemon screams)

00:16:38.103 --> 00:16:40.505
I am the Celestial Digimon.

00:16:40.539 --> 00:16:44.443
With TK at my side, I am
the hope of the world.

00:16:46.445 --> 00:16:48.347
(Angemon gasps)

00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:49.915
I am indestructible

00:16:49.948 --> 00:16:51.383
-I am indestructible
-I am indestructible

00:16:51.416 --> 00:16:53.218
I am indestructible

00:16:54.886 --> 00:16:59.191
Hope, so that is the
thing that holds you back?

00:16:59.224 --> 00:17:00.726
Well in that case.

00:17:02.761 --> 00:17:05.097
(Angemon screams)

00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:07.599
-I am indestructible
-I am indestructible

00:17:07.632 --> 00:17:09.768
-I am indestructible
-I am indestructible

00:17:09.801 --> 00:17:11.436
-I am indestructible
-I am indestructible

00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:12.471
Angemon!

00:17:13.739 --> 00:17:15.941
There is nothing to fear,

00:17:15.974 --> 00:17:20.045
come join the darkness and
all your pain will fade away.

00:17:20.078 --> 00:17:22.314
(TK pants)

00:17:23.248 --> 00:17:26.051
Don't listen to him Angemon.

00:17:26.084 --> 00:17:27.085
Run, TK.

00:17:28.487 --> 00:17:29.788
Now destroy it.

00:17:29.821 --> 00:17:32.224
Put an end to the curse
known as the Digi-destined

00:17:32.257 --> 00:17:34.259
with your own hands.

00:17:34.292 --> 00:17:38.630
That sin will crush your
heart and your hope.

00:17:38.663 --> 00:17:40.565
And then hope will
disappear with the passing

00:17:40.599 --> 00:17:42.567
of the Celestial Digimon,

00:17:42.601 --> 00:17:44.469
and you will be reborn.

00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:48.306
(Angemon screams)

00:17:49.775 --> 00:17:53.745
Reborn as beautiful black
wings fallen into darkness.

00:17:53.779 --> 00:17:56.014
A Digimon of darkness.

00:17:59.851 --> 00:18:01.453
Angemon, no.

00:18:02.621 --> 00:18:05.457
(Angemon screams)

00:18:16.368 --> 00:18:18.103
Why do you not run?

00:18:18.136 --> 00:18:20.338
Why do you not fear?

00:18:20.372 --> 00:18:23.542
Angemon will never
be beaten by you.

00:18:26.845 --> 00:18:29.548
(Angemon groans)

00:18:32.717 --> 00:18:36.121
And that's why I
won't lose either.

00:18:36.154 --> 00:18:38.323
Angemon, I believe in you.

00:18:41.059 --> 00:18:43.128
(bright music)

00:18:43.161 --> 00:18:45.397
(TK gasps)

00:18:48.333 --> 00:18:50.402
[Angemon] And I, in you.

00:18:51.837 --> 00:18:56.408
No matter how far or how deep
into the darkness I fall,

00:18:59.845 --> 00:19:02.347
if you are with me, I can fly.

00:19:04.082 --> 00:19:05.817
I knew you could do it.

00:19:05.851 --> 00:19:07.385
(Digivice powers up)

00:19:07.419 --> 00:19:10.055
(Devimon groans)

00:19:10.088 --> 00:19:13.158
Hear me, shadow, and know this,

00:19:13.191 --> 00:19:15.494
just as you are indestructible,

00:19:15.527 --> 00:19:19.865
so too will the light of
hope never be extinguished.

00:19:20.932 --> 00:19:23.768
(Devimon screams)

00:19:32.444 --> 00:19:34.679
(Digivice chimes)

00:19:34.713 --> 00:19:36.448
Agemon digivolve to

00:19:46.625 --> 00:19:47.893
MagnaAngemon!

00:19:50.595 --> 00:19:53.231
(TK gasps)

00:19:53.265 --> 00:19:56.268
(Laser chimes)

00:19:56.301 --> 00:19:59.437
(electrical buzzing)

00:20:01.806 --> 00:20:02.807
Huh?

00:20:03.475 --> 00:20:05.076
(Sakkakumon thuds)

00:20:05.110 --> 00:20:07.812
(digital chimes)

00:20:08.813 --> 00:20:09.814
Huh?

00:20:10.649 --> 00:20:12.050
Where are we?

00:20:12.083 --> 00:20:13.919
We're outside again.

00:20:15.086 --> 00:20:16.755
(Kari gasps)

00:20:16.788 --> 00:20:18.123
[Kari] Tai!

00:20:18.156 --> 00:20:20.392
[Mimi] Oh, thank goodness!

00:20:20.425 --> 00:20:21.393
[Tai] Kari!

00:20:21.426 --> 00:20:23.428
[Sora] I'm so glad
you made it out.

00:20:23.461 --> 00:20:24.796
Nice work, TK.

00:20:27.832 --> 00:20:30.268
(TK laughs)

00:20:47.519 --> 00:20:50.121
Severe data damage reported.

00:20:50.155 --> 00:20:53.592
Indicating our plan
needs adjustments.

00:20:53.625 --> 00:20:56.127
Beware of the Digi-destined.

00:20:56.161 --> 00:20:57.162
Beware.

00:20:57.963 --> 00:21:00.832
(Gentle music)

00:21:00.865 --> 00:21:02.434
Is that?

00:21:02.467 --> 00:21:03.668
MagnaAngemon.

00:21:06.838 --> 00:21:10.775
You say hope is as
indestructible as I am.

00:21:10.809 --> 00:21:14.613
We shall see if those
words are true or not

00:21:14.646 --> 00:21:17.015
The answer to that
lies beyond the path

00:21:17.048 --> 00:21:19.851
that TK and I must follow.

00:21:19.884 --> 00:21:22.954
You just watch, old friend.

00:21:22.988 --> 00:21:26.458
(Devimon laughs)

00:21:26.491 --> 00:21:28.793
(TK gasps)

00:21:28.827 --> 00:21:30.629
There's no need to worry.

00:21:30.662 --> 00:21:32.464
Thank you, TK.

00:21:32.497 --> 00:21:35.333
And thank you too, MagnaAngemon.
