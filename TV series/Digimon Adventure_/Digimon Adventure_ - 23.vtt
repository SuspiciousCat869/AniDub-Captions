[Narrator] To save
the Celestial Digimon

00:01:42.038 --> 00:01:43.840
who turned into a digi-egg,

00:01:43.874 --> 00:01:45.976
Tai, Matt, and TK found a way

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:48.211
to break into Devimon's castle.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.650
Meanwhile, Devimon's hands
of evil were hard at work

00:01:53.683 --> 00:01:56.353
taking over tankers
in the real world,

00:01:56.386 --> 00:02:00.023
in an attempt to throw the
world into a state of turmoil.

00:02:01.992 --> 00:02:04.828
In the Digital World,
Tai's side was in a battle

00:02:04.861 --> 00:02:08.398
with Skullknightmon who was
trying to dye the digi-egg dark.

00:02:14.838 --> 00:02:16.373
Amidst the intense battle,

00:02:16.406 --> 00:02:18.875
Skullknightmon
managed to digivolve

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:22.045
into a menacing and
powerful Axeknightmon.

00:02:22.078 --> 00:02:23.880
Their fierce battle
eventually led

00:02:23.914 --> 00:02:26.082
to the collapse of
Devimon's castle.

00:02:30.887 --> 00:02:32.322
After the dust settled,

00:02:32.355 --> 00:02:34.658
TK was able to
retrieve the digi-egg

00:02:34.691 --> 00:02:38.094
and watched as Poyomon
hatched before his very eyes.

00:02:39.563 --> 00:02:42.999
However, just when things
seemed to have calmed down,

00:02:43.033 --> 00:02:46.670
Devimon made his inevitable
appearance at last.

00:02:46.703 --> 00:02:48.505
How will Tai and
his friends react

00:02:48.538 --> 00:02:51.241
to finally being face to
face with the worst enemy

00:02:51.274 --> 00:02:52.609
they've ever encountered?

00:03:01.384 --> 00:03:03.954
(wind howling)

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:11.862
We finally meet, Digi-destined.

00:03:11.895 --> 00:03:16.900
And you, good to see you
again, my old friend.

00:03:19.236 --> 00:03:21.404
TK, go somewhere and hide.

00:03:24.941 --> 00:03:28.078
Devimon, all the
disasters in our world

00:03:28.111 --> 00:03:29.779
and the Digital World,

00:03:30.313 --> 00:03:33.783
it was you who caused
them to happen, wasn't it?

00:03:33.817 --> 00:03:35.552
But it won't happen again,

00:03:35.585 --> 00:03:37.787
because we're stopping you here.

00:03:37.821 --> 00:03:39.990
You will soon know pain.

00:03:41.324 --> 00:03:43.293
Weregarurumon, can
you still fight?

00:03:43.326 --> 00:03:44.728
Yeah!

00:03:44.761 --> 00:03:47.631
Now suffer.

00:03:47.664 --> 00:03:49.099
Ready, MetalGreymon?

00:03:49.132 --> 00:03:50.600
Yeah!

00:03:50.634 --> 00:03:54.137
(dramatic music)

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.507
(MetalGreymon groaning)

00:04:02.512 --> 00:04:04.014
The touch of evil.

00:04:05.282 --> 00:04:08.818
(Weregarurumon exclaims)

00:04:08.852 --> 00:04:10.287
What's wrong?

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.321
Run for cover!

00:04:14.124 --> 00:04:15.258
[TK] Matt!

00:04:15.292 --> 00:04:16.326
Don't move!

00:04:18.128 --> 00:04:21.097
What was that attack just now?

00:04:21.131 --> 00:04:23.567
(dramatic music)

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.103
[Matt] Try to get closer to
him using the debris as cover.

00:04:27.137 --> 00:04:28.204
Copy that.

00:04:32.309 --> 00:04:35.145
(lasers whirring)

00:04:51.361 --> 00:04:52.862
Are you kidding?

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.403
(Weregarurumon exclaims)

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:04.975
You okay over there?

00:05:05.008 --> 00:05:06.343
(Tai gasps)

00:05:15.852 --> 00:05:18.722
(computer beeping)

00:05:18.755 --> 00:05:21.157
Are there any updates
on the tanker yet, Izzy?

00:05:21.191 --> 00:05:23.560
[Izzy] We still can't get the
system back under control.

00:05:23.593 --> 00:05:24.594
[Mimi] What?

00:05:25.261 --> 00:05:27.998
(dramatic music)

00:05:28.031 --> 00:05:30.567
Has the ship's system
managed to recover yet?

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.836
[Crewman] No, and
I'm still not seeing

00:05:32.869 --> 00:05:34.070
any problems with it.

00:05:34.104 --> 00:05:36.072
Well, it couldn't
hurt to check again.

00:05:36.106 --> 00:05:37.107
Sir.

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:46.182
[Joe] Hasn't that Calmaramon
thing been defeated yet?

00:05:46.216 --> 00:05:47.417
I don't think so.

00:05:48.785 --> 00:05:51.054
And if it hasn't been
defeated, it's still hiding.

00:05:52.255 --> 00:05:54.524
[Kabuterimon] Are you
seeing all this, Izzy?

00:05:54.557 --> 00:05:58.228
Something strange is
happening over here.

00:05:58.895 --> 00:06:01.264
It looks like all the data
flowing within the network

00:06:01.297 --> 00:06:03.099
is starting to gather.

00:06:03.133 --> 00:06:04.567
What does that mean, Izzy?

00:06:04.601 --> 00:06:07.270
It's complicated, but
I'll try to explain.

00:06:07.303 --> 00:06:09.205
Take a look at this,

00:06:09.239 --> 00:06:11.775
the data the
Argomon were eating,

00:06:11.808 --> 00:06:14.077
news and social media data,

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:16.046
and all the data in
the network traffic

00:06:16.079 --> 00:06:17.380
that's been recently activated

00:06:17.414 --> 00:06:19.382
thanks to the recent confusion.

00:06:19.416 --> 00:06:21.551
It appears that all of
it is being absorbed

00:06:21.584 --> 00:06:23.253
by this obelisk, you know,

00:06:23.286 --> 00:06:24.888
the lighthouse looking thing,

00:06:24.921 --> 00:06:26.923
which is transferring
it further.

00:06:28.324 --> 00:06:30.894
Oh, to the Digital World.

00:06:30.927 --> 00:06:32.395
Wait a sec.

00:06:32.429 --> 00:06:35.265
(dramatic music)

00:06:35.298 --> 00:06:37.934
Does that mean what
happened back in fake Tokyo

00:06:37.967 --> 00:06:39.903
is happening again?

00:06:39.936 --> 00:06:41.638
That's exactly what's going on,

00:06:41.671 --> 00:06:44.007
which means Tai and
Matt might be in danger.

00:06:44.974 --> 00:06:47.811
(lasers whirring)

00:06:49.612 --> 00:06:51.648
(Tai exclaims)

00:06:51.681 --> 00:06:53.149
It's miasma!

00:06:53.183 --> 00:06:55.785
Devimon is somehow able
to control that dark mist

00:06:55.819 --> 00:06:58.254
like it's a solid substance.

00:06:58.288 --> 00:07:00.423
That means this entire space

00:07:00.457 --> 00:07:02.625
is under Devimon's control.

00:07:05.128 --> 00:07:08.031
(crystal whirring)

00:07:25.482 --> 00:07:28.485
The attacks finally stopped.

00:07:28.518 --> 00:07:29.853
Now's our chance,

00:07:29.886 --> 00:07:32.021
we have to blow
away all this mist.

00:07:32.055 --> 00:07:33.857
You think you can do it?

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:35.291
You know it.

00:07:35.325 --> 00:07:38.061
(dramatic music)

00:07:47.036 --> 00:07:50.240
Then we just have to find a way
to break that ugly obelisk.

00:07:50.573 --> 00:07:51.808
Togemon!

00:07:51.841 --> 00:07:53.309
Come on, you've
got this Birdramon.

00:07:53.343 --> 00:07:55.712
[Togemon] Let me
handle this, Mimi!

00:07:55.745 --> 00:07:58.381
[Birdramon] Who's
up for calamari?

00:07:58.414 --> 00:08:00.316
(dramatic music)

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:03.253
(Digimon grunting)

00:08:06.089 --> 00:08:07.724
That came out of nowhere.

00:08:07.757 --> 00:08:09.559
It was camouflaged.

00:08:09.592 --> 00:08:12.162
(Digimon grunting)

00:08:12.195 --> 00:08:14.597
[Kabuterimon] Hey,
don't forget about me.

00:08:15.765 --> 00:08:19.068
(Kabuterimon groaning)

00:08:27.877 --> 00:08:29.746
[Togemon] It's so hot.

00:08:29.779 --> 00:08:33.016
[Kabuterimon] I'm gonna melt.

00:08:33.049 --> 00:08:38.054
-(sirens wailing)
-(dramatic music)

00:09:09.319 --> 00:09:11.029
[TK] Stop it!

00:09:22.907 --> 00:09:23.908
TK.

00:09:30.048 --> 00:09:32.016
Don't you bully my friends.

00:09:33.885 --> 00:09:36.721
Just leave them alone!

00:09:36.754 --> 00:09:39.390
(gentle music)

00:09:42.927 --> 00:09:43.928
Poyomon?

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:04.082
Tokomon!

00:10:04.115 --> 00:10:08.720
You just digivolved.

00:10:08.753 --> 00:10:11.623
(Devimon groaning)

00:10:14.392 --> 00:10:17.395
Why do you resist darkness?

00:10:17.428 --> 00:10:20.531
Why do you resist me?

00:10:20.565 --> 00:10:23.134
(Devimon yells)

00:10:24.602 --> 00:10:29.307
Why, why, why?

00:10:32.644 --> 00:10:34.612
What are you doing?

00:10:34.646 --> 00:10:37.315
(dramatic music)

00:10:41.653 --> 00:10:44.322
(Devimon yells)

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:50.261
What's this?

00:10:50.295 --> 00:10:53.298
The energy being sent to the
Digital World is increasing

00:10:53.331 --> 00:10:55.566
and accelerating!

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:58.336
(dramatic music)

00:11:06.978 --> 00:11:09.981
(lightning crashes)

00:11:16.688 --> 00:11:18.022
[Devimon] I...

00:11:20.525 --> 00:11:23.461
(Devimon groaning)

00:11:42.814 --> 00:11:47.819
[Neodevimon] I
digivolve to Neodevimon.

00:11:51.656 --> 00:11:54.359
[Kabuterimon] Well,
it was worth a shot.

00:11:54.392 --> 00:11:55.793
Kabuterimon.

00:11:55.827 --> 00:11:57.328
This is bad.

00:11:57.362 --> 00:11:58.730
No, it's okay.

00:12:00.898 --> 00:12:04.001
(Ikkakumon groaning)

00:12:08.005 --> 00:12:10.641
[Ikkakumon] I can't see!

00:12:10.675 --> 00:12:12.043
(group sighs)

00:12:12.076 --> 00:12:14.846
Yeah, nevermind, just
pretend I never said that.

00:12:15.747 --> 00:12:16.981
No way.

00:12:17.014 --> 00:12:17.982
Forgive me.

00:12:18.015 --> 00:12:19.851
Forget about that.

00:12:19.884 --> 00:12:22.553
The first tanker is going
to crash into the port

00:12:22.587 --> 00:12:23.588
any minute now.

00:12:24.856 --> 00:12:27.592
(dramatic music)

00:12:31.529 --> 00:12:33.364
It digivolved.

00:12:33.398 --> 00:12:34.899
Not only that,

00:12:34.932 --> 00:12:38.069
but it's like something
feels completely different

00:12:38.102 --> 00:12:39.103
from last time.

00:12:39.937 --> 00:12:42.707
(dramatic music)

00:12:57.121 --> 00:12:58.456
Tokomon, wait!

00:13:04.796 --> 00:13:05.897
Behind you!

00:13:07.131 --> 00:13:08.299
Guilty Claw!

00:13:13.404 --> 00:13:14.405
Wolf Claw!

00:13:23.581 --> 00:13:26.050
(Weregarurumon exclaims)

00:13:26.083 --> 00:13:27.418
Weregarurumon!

00:13:31.489 --> 00:13:32.490
Giga Storm!

00:13:54.679 --> 00:13:58.015
(MetalGreymon exclaims)

00:13:59.617 --> 00:14:01.285
If this keeps up-

00:14:01.319 --> 00:14:04.322
[Izzy] Tai, Matt,
can you hear me?

00:14:05.289 --> 00:14:06.257
What?

00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:07.925
Is that you, Izzy?

00:14:07.959 --> 00:14:09.961
[Izzy] How's the
situation over there?

00:14:09.994 --> 00:14:12.597
Well, not great.

00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:14.332
(Tai exclaims)

00:14:14.365 --> 00:14:16.501
[Izzy] We're trying to-

00:14:17.335 --> 00:14:18.936
You still there?

00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:19.971
Can you hear me?

00:14:21.172 --> 00:14:24.175
So Tai's been fighting
this entire time?

00:14:24.208 --> 00:14:28.112
That must mean that another
ridiculous enemy showed up.

00:14:28.145 --> 00:14:30.815
(Mimi exclaims)

00:14:38.055 --> 00:14:41.359
(Weregarurumon groans)

00:14:48.332 --> 00:14:49.534
You'll see,

00:14:52.503 --> 00:14:56.874
we'll beat you, all
of us, as a team!

00:14:56.908 --> 00:14:59.677
(dramatic music)

00:15:08.753 --> 00:15:11.055
[Izzy] As long as
we can still fight,

00:15:11.088 --> 00:15:12.490
we have to try and find a way

00:15:12.523 --> 00:15:14.692
to help Tai, Matt,
and everyone else

00:15:14.725 --> 00:15:17.028
who's fighting in the
Digital World right now.

00:15:18.529 --> 00:15:21.499
Because no matter how far
away from each other we are,

00:15:21.532 --> 00:15:22.733
we're still a team.

00:15:24.368 --> 00:15:26.437
[Mimi] Please, Togemon.

00:15:27.371 --> 00:15:30.374
[Sora] You can do it, Birdramon.

00:15:30.408 --> 00:15:34.178
[Joe] I'm counting
on you, Ikkakumon.

00:15:34.211 --> 00:15:35.913
[Izzy] Kabuterimon.

00:15:39.917 --> 00:15:42.620
[Togemon] Togemon digivolve to-

00:15:56.634 --> 00:15:57.635
Lillymon!

00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:02.139
[Birdramon] Birdramon,
digivolve to-

00:16:08.479 --> 00:16:12.083
(singing in Japanese)

00:16:12.116 --> 00:16:14.118
[Garudamon] Garudamon!

00:16:15.453 --> 00:16:18.956
[Kabuterimon]
Kabuterimon, digivolve to-

00:16:26.931 --> 00:16:29.934
[MegaKabuterimon]
MegaKabuterimon!

00:16:33.838 --> 00:16:36.007
Ikkakumon, digivolve to-

00:16:49.286 --> 00:16:50.955
[Zudomon] Zudomon!

00:16:53.858 --> 00:16:55.860
-Here goes.
-All right!

00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:01.132
Let's see who's stronger.

00:17:06.804 --> 00:17:08.139
Flower Cannon!

00:17:13.144 --> 00:17:14.178
Wing Blade!

00:17:16.213 --> 00:17:17.381
Horn Buster!

00:17:26.824 --> 00:17:29.293
All that's left is the obelisk.

00:17:29.326 --> 00:17:31.462
We'll try not to
mess up this time.

00:17:31.495 --> 00:17:32.630
Zudomon!

00:17:32.663 --> 00:17:37.668
Vulcan's Hammer!

00:17:43.741 --> 00:17:47.178
(Weregarurumon groaning)

00:17:54.051 --> 00:17:57.221
(Neodevimon groaning)

00:18:04.595 --> 00:18:09.400
-(siren wailing)
-(alarm beeping)

00:18:18.075 --> 00:18:20.845
(static buzzing)

00:18:23.247 --> 00:18:24.515
Hit him one last time.

00:18:28.185 --> 00:18:30.654
(Weregarurumon exclaims)

00:18:30.688 --> 00:18:33.424
(dramatic music)

00:18:35.359 --> 00:18:37.027
[Crewman] The system's restored.

00:18:37.061 --> 00:18:38.996
[Captain] Full speed astern!

00:18:39.029 --> 00:18:40.231
Activate brakes.

00:18:40.264 --> 00:18:42.066
Starboard on my cue.

00:18:42.099 --> 00:18:43.167
Start turning!

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:44.835
[Crewman] Hard to starboard.

00:18:44.869 --> 00:18:46.370
Steady.

00:18:46.403 --> 00:18:48.372
Come on, we're so close.

00:18:52.109 --> 00:18:55.880
(Neodevimon groaning)

00:18:55.913 --> 00:18:58.449
Quick, before it can recover.

00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:00.785
Giga Blaster!

00:19:15.466 --> 00:19:18.803
(Neodevimon exclaiming)

00:19:34.418 --> 00:19:37.087
(siren wailing)

00:19:51.168 --> 00:19:53.938
You mean it actually stopped?

00:19:56.674 --> 00:19:58.242
But how?

00:19:58.275 --> 00:20:00.277
Who was able to save us in time?

00:20:04.481 --> 00:20:06.417
You guys, I've just confirmed

00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:07.751
the tanker system's recovery.

00:20:07.785 --> 00:20:08.786
We did it.

00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:12.356
(group exclaims)

00:20:18.529 --> 00:20:20.798
What's the matter, Tai?

00:20:20.831 --> 00:20:24.168
I have a feeling we owe
everyone back home big time,

00:20:24.201 --> 00:20:25.302
don't you think?

00:20:28.038 --> 00:20:29.640
Not too shabby, TK.

00:20:30.708 --> 00:20:33.010
(TK laughs)

00:20:41.852 --> 00:20:44.388
(ominous tone)

00:20:49.994 --> 00:20:52.696
(dramatic music)

00:20:59.236 --> 00:21:00.871
[Axelknightmon] For
the perseverance

00:21:00.905 --> 00:21:05.042
that exceeds one's own
ruin, Digivolve once more!

00:21:09.046 --> 00:21:11.882
(electricity buzzing)

00:21:11.916 --> 00:21:14.251
(Tai gasps)

00:21:28.699 --> 00:21:29.700
No way.

00:21:33.103 --> 00:21:35.739
(mask cracking)

00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:40.477

[Izzy] Next up on the Digimon
Encyclopedia is Lillymon.

00:22:44.341 --> 00:22:47.277
This Fairy Digimon
digivolves from Togemon.

00:22:47.311 --> 00:22:49.580
Lillymon is able to
defeat most enemies

00:22:49.613 --> 00:22:51.015
by using Flower Cannon.

00:22:52.449 --> 00:22:54.485
And check out this fun fact,

00:22:54.518 --> 00:22:56.587
it seems like most
Ultimate Digimon

00:22:56.620 --> 00:22:59.156
bear some resemblance to
their previous digivolution,

00:22:59.189 --> 00:23:01.959
but with Lillymon, there's
almost zero resemblance.

00:23:01.992 --> 00:23:03.660
The mystery of Digimon!

00:23:06.530 --> 00:23:08.866
Which Digimon will
it be next time?

00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:11.268
(dramatic music)

00:23:11.301 --> 00:23:13.003
[Narrator] Tai is defeated,

00:23:13.037 --> 00:23:15.305
however, a new
hope shines through

00:23:15.339 --> 00:23:17.107
as a miracle occurs!

00:23:17.141 --> 00:23:19.810
[Tai] Next time, "The
Final Stage, Dandevimon."

00:23:21.211 --> 00:23:23.881
[Narrator] The adventure
continues in a new world.
