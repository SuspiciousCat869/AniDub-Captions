[Narrator] This is
the mysterious world

00:01:42.462 --> 00:01:46.049
where Digimon live,
the Digital World.

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:48.509
Tai Kamiya and
the Digi-destined,

00:01:48.551 --> 00:01:50.678
along with their
Digimon partners,

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.056
continue their adventure,
to a new world.

00:01:55.892 --> 00:01:58.144
(explosion)

00:01:58.144 --> 00:01:59.354
In the real world,

00:01:59.395 --> 00:02:02.857
a failed rocket launch
ended in an explosion,

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:06.486
while simultaneously, a
mysterious black lightning

00:02:06.486 --> 00:02:07.862
ripped through the sky,

00:02:07.904 --> 00:02:12.200
granting some Digimon
violently destructive powers.

00:02:12.241 --> 00:02:15.036
The Digi-destined had to fight
their way through a world

00:02:15.078 --> 00:02:17.205
where none but the
fittest survive,

00:02:18.331 --> 00:02:20.500
only to run up against
a powerful enemy

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.878
they had encountered before
on the Cloud Continent,

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.255
the mysterious, AxeKnightmon.

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.344
And it was then,

00:02:31.386 --> 00:02:35.765
that the Celestial Digimon,
Angemon, descended once again.

00:02:36.891 --> 00:02:40.770
(melodious instrumental music)

00:02:58.705 --> 00:02:59.914
Angemon.

00:02:59.956 --> 00:03:01.541
(low awe grunt)

00:03:01.541 --> 00:03:05.211
I can't believe it,
the Celestial Digimon.

00:03:05.211 --> 00:03:07.380
[Biyomon] So pretty.

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:08.589
Angemon!

00:03:08.631 --> 00:03:09.632
Let's do it.

00:03:10.717 --> 00:03:12.051
All right, TK!

00:03:13.761 --> 00:03:16.556

00:03:16.556 --> 00:03:19.142

(loud blast)

00:04:01.476 --> 00:04:02.769
Begone!

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:05.104
My business is not with you.

00:04:08.316 --> 00:04:10.359

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:28.961
Angemon!

(grunts)

00:04:35.676 --> 00:04:38.638

Hand of Fate!

(blown away screams)

00:05:45.204 --> 00:05:47.373
(loud rumbling)

00:05:47.373 --> 00:05:49.709
(harsh screeching)

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:52.587
(thunder strikes)

00:05:56.215 --> 00:05:59.218
(thundering)

00:05:59.218 --> 00:06:02.972
(ominous instrumental music)

00:06:08.269 --> 00:06:10.730

(shimmering)

00:06:33.085 --> 00:06:34.420
Kari, wake up!

00:06:35.922 --> 00:06:37.298
(groggy waking grunt)

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:38.341
Huh?

00:06:40.426 --> 00:06:42.011
Agumon, you good?

00:06:43.471 --> 00:06:45.264
Glad you're okay.

00:06:45.264 --> 00:06:46.265
Bumpy ride, huh?

00:06:48.684 --> 00:06:51.520
Not gonna lie, I've
definitely been better.

00:06:52.688 --> 00:06:55.024
Oh, wait, where's
everybody else?

00:06:56.192 --> 00:06:57.652
Oh yeah, I don't see them.

00:06:57.693 --> 00:06:58.694
Huh?

00:06:59.946 --> 00:07:00.947
Huh?

00:07:01.697 --> 00:07:02.657
[Sora] Tai!

00:07:02.698 --> 00:07:03.950
Tai, are you there?

00:07:03.991 --> 00:07:05.326
Do you hear me?

00:07:05.368 --> 00:07:06.494
Sora?

00:07:06.535 --> 00:07:07.828
Is everyone okay?

00:07:09.622 --> 00:07:13.334
Ohh, I'm so glad to
hear someone's voice!

00:07:13.376 --> 00:07:15.002
Tai, where are you now?

00:07:15.044 --> 00:07:17.838
It seems like somehow
we all got separated.

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:19.173
Looks like it.

00:07:19.215 --> 00:07:20.299
How 'bout you?

00:07:20.299 --> 00:07:21.634
Is anyone with you?

00:07:21.676 --> 00:07:24.637
[Tai] Yeah, Kari
and Agumon are here.

00:07:24.637 --> 00:07:25.638
I see.

00:07:25.638 --> 00:07:26.764
(thundering)

00:07:26.806 --> 00:07:28.474
You take care of your
sister out there.

00:07:28.474 --> 00:07:29.475
[Tai] I will.

00:07:30.476 --> 00:07:31.477
Matt.

00:07:31.477 --> 00:07:32.478
(affirmative grunt)

00:07:32.478 --> 00:07:33.980
Let's show 'em what we got!

00:07:35.314 --> 00:07:39.151
Howling Blaster!

00:07:39.151 --> 00:07:41.320
Listen, just be
careful, Tai, will you?

00:07:41.362 --> 00:07:44.490
There are Digimon
all over the place!

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:49.495
[Tentomon] Yeah, we'll
probably gonna get eaten.

00:07:50.997 --> 00:07:53.416
(fear grunt)

00:07:54.333 --> 00:07:56.836
(pulling/lifting grunt)

00:07:56.877 --> 00:07:58.838
Whew, thanks, Palmon.

00:08:03.259 --> 00:08:06.512
[Palmon] Someone's
still chasing us!

00:08:06.512 --> 00:08:07.555
(worried grunts)

00:08:07.596 --> 00:08:09.015
-(thundering)
-(flinch grunts)

00:08:09.015 --> 00:08:10.433
Enough already!

00:08:13.769 --> 00:08:15.855
(groans)

00:08:15.855 --> 00:08:17.898
Hey, this is Joe, checking in!

00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:22.028
Gomamon and I are in a
pretty sweet spot here.

00:08:22.069 --> 00:08:23.362
(blessed-out groan)

00:08:23.362 --> 00:08:24.363
(gasp)

00:08:24.363 --> 00:08:25.573
I know, right.

00:08:25.614 --> 00:08:27.199
Why don't they all
come meet us here?

00:08:27.241 --> 00:08:29.201
Oh, that's a great idea!

00:08:29.243 --> 00:08:30.244
Hm?

00:08:31.912 --> 00:08:33.414
(freaked scream)

00:08:33.456 --> 00:08:34.415
Um...

00:08:34.457 --> 00:08:35.541
Wait, who are you?

00:08:36.459 --> 00:08:38.044
(freaked groans)

00:08:38.044 --> 00:08:44.842
(quirky instrumental music)

00:08:46.343 --> 00:08:47.762
[Tai] I just don't get it.

00:08:47.803 --> 00:08:49.638
How did we all get separated?

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:52.308
It must've happened when
that rocket exploded.

00:08:52.349 --> 00:08:55.186
I think Angemon tried to
evacuate us all to safety.

00:08:55.227 --> 00:08:57.021
Oh, we can't catch a break.

00:08:57.063 --> 00:08:59.690
(lifting grunt)

00:08:59.732 --> 00:09:02.193
TK, how's Angemon holding up?

00:09:02.234 --> 00:09:05.196
[TK] Back to being
Patamon and fast asleep.

00:09:06.238 --> 00:09:07.364
[Tai] Not surprised.

00:09:07.406 --> 00:09:10.326
Angemon fought
hard to protect us.

00:09:10.367 --> 00:09:11.660
Hm.

00:09:11.702 --> 00:09:13.162
Yeah, you're right.

00:09:13.204 --> 00:09:14.330
Well...

00:09:14.371 --> 00:09:16.999
Now we'll just gotta figure
out a way to meet up.

00:09:17.041 --> 00:09:18.709
Oh, by the way, Izzy.

00:09:18.751 --> 00:09:21.045
Any word on what's
going on in our world?

00:09:21.087 --> 00:09:22.671
That NASA incident,

00:09:22.713 --> 00:09:24.715
it really managed to
light up the internet.

00:09:24.715 --> 00:09:27.343
Rumors and chatter are
keeping everybody busy.

00:09:27.384 --> 00:09:29.053
But that turns
into black energy,

00:09:29.095 --> 00:09:30.721
and I've confirmed
that a mass of it

00:09:30.763 --> 00:09:33.057
is flowing into this continent.

00:09:33.057 --> 00:09:35.017
It's happening again!

00:09:35.059 --> 00:09:36.393
[Izzy] Conspiracy theories about

00:09:36.393 --> 00:09:38.187
the incident have
appeared online,

00:09:38.229 --> 00:09:40.397
so intelligence agencies
are on the move.

00:09:41.732 --> 00:09:43.359
There's even a rumor
spreading around

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.611
that there was a spy
satellite on that rocket.

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:48.239
And of course, these
kinds of theories

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:50.241
are just creating
more network traffic.

00:09:51.075 --> 00:09:53.244
(explosion)

00:09:53.244 --> 00:09:55.621
(whimpering)

00:09:57.289 --> 00:09:58.415
(freaked out grunt)

00:09:58.457 --> 00:10:00.709
They're only sporadic
up to this point,

00:10:00.751 --> 00:10:03.420
but system errors are occurring
more and more frequently

00:10:03.462 --> 00:10:06.132
in space development
networks between nations.

00:10:06.924 --> 00:10:08.717
These are the places
where the Zurumon

00:10:08.759 --> 00:10:11.303
are most likely establishing
new feeding grounds.

00:10:12.263 --> 00:10:13.722
Got it.

00:10:13.764 --> 00:10:16.058
So guys, you all
heard that, right?

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:18.394
Stay alert and contact
each other right away

00:10:18.435 --> 00:10:20.229
if anything happens.

00:10:20.271 --> 00:10:21.438
Yeah.

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:24.275
In the meantime, I'll keep on
gathering more information.

00:10:24.275 --> 00:10:26.610
We're all counting on you, Izzy!

00:10:26.652 --> 00:10:29.071
We better get moving,
we got friends to find.

00:10:29.113 --> 00:10:30.114
Mm-hmm.

00:10:30.156 --> 00:10:31.157
Kari...

00:10:32.116 --> 00:10:34.410
(puzzled gasp)

00:10:34.451 --> 00:10:35.744
What are you staring at?

00:10:35.786 --> 00:10:36.787
I don't know.

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:40.124
It's happening again.

00:10:40.166 --> 00:10:41.792
Ever since we were little,

00:10:41.834 --> 00:10:45.296
sometimes she'd
just get like this.

00:10:45.337 --> 00:10:47.631
Always looking off
into the distance,

00:10:48.674 --> 00:10:50.801
like she's waiting
for something.

00:10:50.843 --> 00:10:51.969
Kari?

00:10:51.969 --> 00:10:55.264
Now way, how did you get here?

00:10:55.306 --> 00:10:56.599
I'm not too sure.

00:10:56.640 --> 00:11:01.645
It's like I was called here.

00:11:03.814 --> 00:11:05.816
-(loud piercing shriek)
-(alarmed gasps)

00:11:05.858 --> 00:11:07.359
What was that sound?

00:11:09.153 --> 00:11:11.989
(loud rumble)

00:11:12.031 --> 00:11:13.824
Something is coming.

00:11:13.866 --> 00:11:16.327
(thundering)

00:11:19.538 --> 00:11:21.999
(thundering)

00:11:25.502 --> 00:11:28.505
(melodious instrumental music)

00:11:28.547 --> 00:11:31.008
(growl/roar)

00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:33.510
Just hang on until
I get there, TK!

00:11:33.552 --> 00:11:34.845
It's okay, Matt.

00:11:34.887 --> 00:11:37.223
Me and Patamon are both strong!

00:11:38.349 --> 00:11:39.516
We're gonna be all right!

00:11:41.727 --> 00:11:43.687
We'll find you guys soon!

00:11:43.687 --> 00:11:44.980
TK...

00:11:45.022 --> 00:11:48.150
Sounds like little
TK is growing up.

00:11:48.192 --> 00:11:51.153
(loud footsteps)

00:11:51.195 --> 00:11:52.655
All right, let's wrap this up.

00:11:52.696 --> 00:11:53.697
Yeah!

00:11:55.366 --> 00:11:57.576
Garurumon digivolve to...

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:02.748
Weregarurumon!

00:12:05.084 --> 00:12:06.877
(roar)

00:12:06.877 --> 00:12:09.922
Don't worry, I'll
protect you, Patamon.

00:12:11.048 --> 00:12:13.676
(Patamon groggy/waking grunt)

00:12:13.717 --> 00:12:15.052
Patamon!

00:12:15.052 --> 00:12:16.887
Where are we?

00:12:16.887 --> 00:12:19.014
I'm trying to find my brother.

00:12:19.056 --> 00:12:20.057
Will you help me?

00:12:21.725 --> 00:12:24.728
(struggling grunt)

00:12:26.105 --> 00:12:28.357
(sigh)

00:12:28.399 --> 00:12:29.692
What's the matter?

00:12:29.733 --> 00:12:33.237
(struggling grunt)

00:12:33.279 --> 00:12:34.280
Huh?

00:12:38.242 --> 00:12:40.035
(sighs)

00:12:40.077 --> 00:12:41.245
I don't get it.

00:12:41.245 --> 00:12:43.747
I don't know what's
wrong with me.

00:12:43.789 --> 00:12:45.082
Just keep resting.

00:12:48.752 --> 00:12:51.046
Well you can't say
he's not persistent.

00:12:51.088 --> 00:12:52.756
Come on, Mimi, let's go.

00:12:52.798 --> 00:12:55.384
We need to rejoin the others.

00:12:55.426 --> 00:12:56.427
All right.

00:12:58.137 --> 00:12:59.763
Huh?

00:12:59.805 --> 00:13:00.806
Is that?

00:13:01.432 --> 00:13:02.391
Hey!

00:13:02.433 --> 00:13:03.934
Come here, look at this!

00:13:03.976 --> 00:13:04.935
Huh?

00:13:04.977 --> 00:13:06.895
I think it's a ruby gemstone!

00:13:06.937 --> 00:13:09.648
When it's polished up, it's
super pretty and sparkly!

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:12.401
(gasp)

00:13:12.443 --> 00:13:13.777
Sparkly?

00:13:13.819 --> 00:13:15.738
Let's take a look, there
might be more of them!

00:13:15.779 --> 00:13:18.782
-Ohh, I want one, too!
-(giggle)

00:13:21.493 --> 00:13:24.455
Well, uh, we better
get going now.

00:13:24.496 --> 00:13:26.290
Don't want to keep
our friends waiting!

00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:29.418
(nervous chuckle)

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:31.587
(sharp shimmering)

00:13:31.628 --> 00:13:34.173
(freaked gasp)

00:13:38.844 --> 00:13:41.972
Well, at least this Digimon's
not trying to, you know,

00:13:42.014 --> 00:13:43.390
eat us.

00:13:43.432 --> 00:13:45.809
No, but we still need
to get out of here.

00:13:45.809 --> 00:13:46.977
The others are waiting.

00:13:47.019 --> 00:13:49.104
(uneasy grunt)

00:13:56.028 --> 00:13:57.071
(loud rumbling)

00:13:59.073 --> 00:14:01.909
(piercing screech)

00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:05.579
(trees bashing)

00:14:08.582 --> 00:14:10.250
It sounds big.

00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:12.419
And it's getting closer.

00:14:12.419 --> 00:14:14.588
(grunts)

00:14:19.259 --> 00:14:21.929
(trees bashing)

00:14:28.143 --> 00:14:31.063
(falling scream)

00:14:31.105 --> 00:14:32.064
Tai!

00:14:32.106 --> 00:14:33.107
Agumon!

00:14:35.609 --> 00:14:37.611
Agumon digivolve to...

00:14:42.116 --> 00:14:43.117
Greymon!

00:14:47.663 --> 00:14:48.622
(Tai laughs)

00:14:48.664 --> 00:14:50.624
Wow, thanks, Greymon.

00:14:50.666 --> 00:14:52.626
(loud piercing screech)

00:14:52.626 --> 00:14:55.921
(trees bashing)

00:14:55.963 --> 00:14:57.756
Here it comes.

00:14:57.798 --> 00:15:00.801
(lightning strikes)

00:15:01.635 --> 00:15:02.803
(screeches)

00:15:02.845 --> 00:15:05.514
(lava rumbling)

00:15:07.307 --> 00:15:10.310
-(tree bashing)
-(grunts)

00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:11.812
Greymon!

00:15:11.812 --> 00:15:13.313
I'm okay.

00:15:13.355 --> 00:15:14.440
(determined grunt)

00:15:14.481 --> 00:15:17.151
(loud stomp)

00:15:17.192 --> 00:15:19.987
(piercing screech)

00:15:20.028 --> 00:15:21.363
What is it, Tai?

00:15:23.323 --> 00:15:24.950
Volcdramon.

00:15:24.992 --> 00:15:27.119
An Ultimate Digimon!

00:15:27.161 --> 00:15:28.620
Greymon, be careful
with this guy!

00:15:28.662 --> 00:15:30.622
(lightning strikes)

00:15:30.664 --> 00:15:33.167
(lava rumbles)

00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:37.171
(piercing screech)

00:15:37.212 --> 00:15:40.674
It's those black sparks that
are giving Volcdramon power!

00:15:46.054 --> 00:15:48.348
(piercing screech)

00:15:48.390 --> 00:15:49.349
Go for it, Greymon!

00:15:49.391 --> 00:15:50.809
Let's do it!

00:15:50.851 --> 00:15:54.521
(intense instrumental music)

00:16:01.403 --> 00:16:04.198
Greymon digivolve to...

00:16:20.881 --> 00:16:22.758
Metalgreymon!

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:28.597
(leap grunt)

00:16:30.557 --> 00:16:33.060
(block grunt)

00:16:34.895 --> 00:16:36.897
Giga Storm!

00:16:43.737 --> 00:16:44.738
What?

00:16:45.614 --> 00:16:47.074
(piercing screech)

00:16:47.115 --> 00:16:48.575
No way!

00:16:48.617 --> 00:16:50.744
We're not done yet.

00:16:50.744 --> 00:16:52.746
(roars)

00:16:54.915 --> 00:16:56.917
(gasp)

00:16:59.419 --> 00:17:02.297
(piercing screech)

00:17:07.427 --> 00:17:10.097
(lava rumbling)

00:17:14.935 --> 00:17:16.061
What?

00:17:16.103 --> 00:17:17.104
No!

00:17:18.272 --> 00:17:20.107
He swallowed it whole!

00:17:20.148 --> 00:17:22.067
Then we have no choice.

00:17:22.109 --> 00:17:23.443
Hang on tight, you two!

00:17:25.612 --> 00:17:27.155
Trident Arm!

00:17:29.783 --> 00:17:32.452
(lava rumbling)

00:17:36.623 --> 00:17:39.626
This Digimon's using
fire as a shield!

00:17:39.668 --> 00:17:42.296
Then I'll just break through it!

00:17:42.337 --> 00:17:44.339
(roars)

00:17:48.176 --> 00:17:49.136
(roars)

00:17:49.177 --> 00:17:51.972
(lava rumbles)

00:17:51.972 --> 00:17:53.974
(roars)

00:17:55.142 --> 00:17:57.978
(cowering grunts)

00:17:58.854 --> 00:17:59.938
Metalgreymon!

00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:00.981
Are you okay?

00:18:01.023 --> 00:18:02.774
Did you get hurt?

00:18:02.816 --> 00:18:04.109
(groan of pain)

00:18:04.151 --> 00:18:06.028
Nah, this is nothing!

00:18:08.655 --> 00:18:10.449
Don't worry, Kari.

00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:12.117
We're not gonna lose!

00:18:12.159 --> 00:18:13.994
Isn't that right, Metalgreymon?

00:18:14.036 --> 00:18:15.287
You bet!

00:18:15.329 --> 00:18:18.165
In fact, I'm gonna
finish this right now!

00:18:21.668 --> 00:18:25.672
(blasting yell/roar)

00:18:32.346 --> 00:18:35.057
(roar of effort)

00:18:40.687 --> 00:18:43.523
(roar of effort)

00:18:49.237 --> 00:18:51.907
(blasted grunt)

00:18:54.576 --> 00:18:57.371
(piercing screech)

00:18:57.371 --> 00:18:59.039
Metalgreymon.

00:18:59.081 --> 00:19:01.208
I'm not giving up that easily.

00:19:02.709 --> 00:19:03.710
All right.

00:19:04.753 --> 00:19:07.005
Let's make Volcdramon
feel our power!

00:19:07.047 --> 00:19:08.048
Yeah!

00:19:16.556 --> 00:19:19.559
(lightning strikes)

00:19:21.895 --> 00:19:23.939
(grunts)

00:19:28.402 --> 00:19:31.113
(roar of effort)

00:19:33.281 --> 00:19:35.742
[Both] Go, Metalgreymon!

00:19:35.742 --> 00:19:39.538
(melodious instrumental music)

00:19:39.579 --> 00:19:40.539
(surprise gasp)

00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:41.915
What the heck?

00:19:42.916 --> 00:19:44.918
(roars)

00:19:49.589 --> 00:19:52.926
(loud rumbling)

00:19:52.926 --> 00:19:56.096
(throwing grunt)

00:19:56.138 --> 00:20:00.100
(melodious instrumental music)

00:20:15.949 --> 00:20:17.075
[Both] Agumon!

00:20:17.117 --> 00:20:19.786
Oh, man, you were awesome!

00:20:19.786 --> 00:20:22.080
I protected you, right, Kari?

00:20:22.122 --> 00:20:23.081
Yeah!

00:20:23.123 --> 00:20:24.124
That was amazing!

00:20:28.128 --> 00:20:29.421
Kari?

00:20:29.463 --> 00:20:30.422
Kari?

00:20:30.464 --> 00:20:32.424
Did she disappear?

00:20:32.466 --> 00:20:33.759
Where'd she go?

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:34.801
Kari!

00:20:38.138 --> 00:20:39.806
Where are you, Kari?

00:20:44.478 --> 00:20:47.022
(alarmed gasps)

00:20:51.485 --> 00:20:52.694
Skullknightmon!

00:20:54.988 --> 00:20:55.947
(gasp)

00:20:55.989 --> 00:20:57.157
[Both] Kari!

00:21:03.538 --> 00:21:04.664
Kari!

00:21:04.706 --> 00:21:06.333
I'm coming, Kari!

00:21:06.333 --> 00:21:07.334
Kari!

00:21:08.835 --> 00:21:11.671
(running breaths)

00:21:15.050 --> 00:21:16.051
Kari?

00:21:21.389 --> 00:21:22.390
Kari!

00:21:31.233 --> 00:21:32.234
Kari!

00:21:34.736 --> 00:21:36.738
But why?

00:21:39.491 --> 00:21:40.450

00:22:48.977 --> 00:22:51.938

Angemon is the
Digimon of justice,

00:22:56.067 --> 00:22:57.444
so I'd like to ask him,

00:22:57.485 --> 00:22:59.070
what's the just way to respond

00:22:59.112 --> 00:23:01.114
to Tentomon's confusing jokes?

00:23:01.156 --> 00:23:04.075
Should I laugh at them or
should I tell them the truth?

00:23:06.786 --> 00:23:08.997
Which Digimon will
it be next time?

00:23:10.457 --> 00:23:11.958
