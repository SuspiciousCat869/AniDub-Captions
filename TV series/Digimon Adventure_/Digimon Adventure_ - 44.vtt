[Narrator] This is
the mysterious world

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:44.799
where Digimon live,
the Digital World.

00:01:44.832 --> 00:01:46.968
Tai and the other Digi-destined,

00:01:47.001 --> 00:01:50.304
along with their partner
Digimon, continue their quest

00:01:50.338 --> 00:01:52.974
to prevent the revival
of Millenniummon,

00:01:53.007 --> 00:01:56.144
the bringer of
destruction and darkness.

00:01:56.177 --> 00:01:59.180
And so, they head for
the Sealed Grounds.

00:02:00.515 --> 00:02:03.518
(Komondomon howling)

00:02:04.685 --> 00:02:06.320
Yay, a forest!

00:02:06.354 --> 00:02:07.822
Aren't we lucky?

00:02:07.855 --> 00:02:08.990
[Joe] We're saved!

00:02:09.023 --> 00:02:11.492
It's been nothing but
flat fields forever!

00:02:11.526 --> 00:02:12.994
[Tai] Okay, Let's all split up

00:02:13.027 --> 00:02:15.163
and see if we can find
some grub around here.

00:02:15.196 --> 00:02:16.831
[Agumon] Great idea!

00:02:16.864 --> 00:02:19.167
(footsteps tapping)

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.169
(Kari whimpering)

00:02:21.202 --> 00:02:22.503
What is it, Kari?

00:02:22.537 --> 00:02:23.538
This thing's alive.

00:02:24.705 --> 00:02:29.710
-(ground rumbling)
-(tense music)

00:02:31.546 --> 00:02:33.014
(all yelping in alarm)

00:02:33.047 --> 00:02:35.016
What is this, an earthquake?

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:38.352
(ground rumbling)

00:02:38.386 --> 00:02:39.353
Do you feel that?

00:02:39.387 --> 00:02:40.354
Yeah.

00:02:40.388 --> 00:02:42.023
This place could be...

00:02:42.056 --> 00:02:43.724
No, it definitely is.

00:02:44.892 --> 00:02:46.194
It's a Digimon!

00:02:46.227 --> 00:02:48.729
(tense music)

00:02:52.567 --> 00:02:55.736
(Petaldramon roaring)

00:03:03.411 --> 00:03:05.713
So it is a Digimon.

00:03:05.746 --> 00:03:07.882
And a truly massive one.

00:03:07.915 --> 00:03:09.383
To carry a forest-

00:03:09.417 --> 00:03:11.052
No, wait a second.

00:03:11.085 --> 00:03:13.087
This Digimon is the forest!

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:15.590
What's that?

00:03:18.926 --> 00:03:20.728
(Sora gasping)

00:03:20.761 --> 00:03:22.230
So what is it?

00:03:22.263 --> 00:03:24.899
[Sora] Some areas of the
forest look pretty damaged.

00:03:24.932 --> 00:03:27.435
(Kari gasping)

00:03:29.937 --> 00:03:31.739

00:03:44.785 --> 00:03:46.921
(bugs buzzing)

00:03:46.954 --> 00:03:48.256
[All] Whoa.

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:50.758
-(Kari panting)
-Kari, wait!

00:03:50.791 --> 00:03:52.760
[Tai] Kari, Gatomon!

00:03:52.793 --> 00:03:55.630
(mystical music)

00:03:58.466 --> 00:04:01.769

-(footsteps tapping)

(bugs chittering)

00:04:12.146 --> 00:04:15.783
(bugs chittering)

00:04:15.816 --> 00:04:18.319
(tense music)

00:04:23.824 --> 00:04:25.293
There you are!

00:04:25.326 --> 00:04:26.494
Lightning Paw!

00:04:28.162 --> 00:04:30.464
-(all panting)
-Blast those things!

00:04:30.498 --> 00:04:31.632
Blue Blaster!

00:04:31.666 --> 00:04:33.000
Pepper Breath!

00:04:34.168 --> 00:04:37.638

(bugs skittering)

00:04:42.677 --> 00:04:46.147
-Kari!
-Gatomon!

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:50.017
(all exclaiming in surprise)

00:04:51.686 --> 00:04:52.653
(Kari gasping)

00:04:52.687 --> 00:04:53.854
You all right?

00:04:55.356 --> 00:04:56.490
(Izzy gasping)

00:04:56.524 --> 00:04:58.659
Looks like they're moving off.

00:04:58.693 --> 00:05:00.995
Guys, I think it's
those black bugs

00:05:01.028 --> 00:05:03.497
that are causing all
the damage down there.

00:05:03.531 --> 00:05:05.666
-The poor forest.
-(Palmon yelping)

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.835
Don't let them destroy me, too!

00:05:07.868 --> 00:05:10.171
(bugs chittering)

00:05:10.204 --> 00:05:11.672
[Izzy] I think they're leaving.

00:05:11.706 --> 00:05:15.009
The bugs seem to be moving
away from the giant Digimon.

00:05:15.042 --> 00:05:18.045
Well, let's hope that means
we've driven them off for now.

00:05:19.213 --> 00:05:22.383
(Petaldramon roaring)

00:05:25.052 --> 00:05:28.856
(Petaldramon creaking)

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:31.892
(footsteps thudding)

00:05:32.893 --> 00:05:34.195
We're moving again!

00:05:34.228 --> 00:05:36.530
I wonder where this
big guy's off to.

00:05:36.564 --> 00:05:39.567
(footsteps thudding)

00:05:44.238 --> 00:05:45.206
Hi, there.

00:05:45.239 --> 00:05:46.240
I'm Kari.

00:05:47.074 --> 00:05:48.542
What's your name?

00:05:48.576 --> 00:05:51.379
(roots creaking)

00:05:51.412 --> 00:05:54.882
(footsteps thudding)

00:05:54.915 --> 00:05:56.217
[Muchomon] It's Petaldramon.

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:57.885
-(all gasping)
-Who's there?

00:05:57.918 --> 00:06:01.055
(Muchomon whimpering)

00:06:01.088 --> 00:06:02.556
Well, thank you.

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:04.058
That's good to know.

00:06:04.091 --> 00:06:06.394
(Muchomon yelping)

00:06:06.427 --> 00:06:07.895
Hey, wait up!

00:06:07.928 --> 00:06:08.896
Where are you going?

00:06:08.929 --> 00:06:11.399
(Gomamon panting)

00:06:11.432 --> 00:06:12.733
[Palmon] Mimi, Mimi!

00:06:12.767 --> 00:06:14.735
Did they say Petaldramon?

00:06:14.769 --> 00:06:16.404
[Mimi] What, do you
know them, Palmon?

00:06:16.437 --> 00:06:17.905
[Gatomon] I've heard that name.

00:06:17.938 --> 00:06:19.240
(Tai humming questioningly)

00:06:19.273 --> 00:06:21.909
It's the name of a being
of great ancient power,

00:06:21.942 --> 00:06:24.412
one that is also known
as the "living forest."

00:06:24.445 --> 00:06:26.414
Whoa, mystical.

00:06:26.447 --> 00:06:27.415
Wow!

00:06:27.448 --> 00:06:28.916
That's a legendary Digimon!

00:06:28.949 --> 00:06:32.420
I can't believe I'm standing
on a legend, so cool!

00:06:32.453 --> 00:06:33.967
Petaldramon...

00:06:37.241 --> 00:06:40.244
(footsteps thudding)

00:06:47.251 --> 00:06:50.087
(bugs chittering)

00:06:55.426 --> 00:06:58.729
(Muchomon panting)

00:06:58.763 --> 00:06:59.897
Stop, will ya?

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:01.065
Don't run away!

00:07:01.098 --> 00:07:02.733
We don't mean you
any harm, really!

00:07:02.767 --> 00:07:04.235
(Muchomon screaming)

00:07:04.268 --> 00:07:06.237
Wait, we just wanna talk to you!

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:09.240
(Gabumon and Muchomon
grunting in pain)

00:07:09.273 --> 00:07:12.443
(footsteps thudding)

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:17.448
This is Muchomon and Puwamon.

00:07:19.617 --> 00:07:21.585
[Gomamon] They thought
we might be dangerous.

00:07:21.619 --> 00:07:23.587
That's why they
ran away from us.

00:07:23.621 --> 00:07:25.423
[Palmon] Do you
live in this forest?

00:07:25.456 --> 00:07:26.457
Yeah.

00:07:27.625 --> 00:07:30.761
'Cause our old home
is gone forever now.

00:07:30.795 --> 00:07:32.596
What happened to it?

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:34.098
(Kari humming sadly)

00:07:34.131 --> 00:07:36.300
It was completely destroyed.

00:07:37.134 --> 00:07:39.270
The forest we used to live in

00:07:39.303 --> 00:07:41.605
was attacked by
those black bugs,

00:07:41.639 --> 00:07:44.442
and a much bigger Digimon, too.

00:07:44.475 --> 00:07:47.144
Our home, everything was eaten.

00:07:48.646 --> 00:07:51.816
But then, Petaldramon...

00:07:53.818 --> 00:07:56.987
(Petaldramon crashing)

00:07:58.823 --> 00:08:00.958
Petaldramon got angry.

00:08:00.991 --> 00:08:05.129
And so, again and again,
Petaldramon has fought them

00:08:05.162 --> 00:08:08.799
and has kept going after
them all this time.

00:08:08.833 --> 00:08:10.468
[Palmon] Well, it's no wonder!

00:08:10.501 --> 00:08:12.303
We'd do the same
thing ourselves.

00:08:12.336 --> 00:08:14.972
It's wrong to destroy a forest!

00:08:15.005 --> 00:08:17.641
[Muchomon] Anyway, that's
why we've been traveling

00:08:17.675 --> 00:08:21.178
with Petaldramon, because
we have nowhere else to go.

00:08:23.013 --> 00:08:25.483
Digimon that eat whole forests?

00:08:25.516 --> 00:08:29.687
So to Petaldramon, these
bugs are like an old nemesis.

00:08:30.855 --> 00:08:33.657
Didn't you mention
that this struggle

00:08:33.691 --> 00:08:36.026
wasn't only between the
darkness and the light?

00:08:37.862 --> 00:08:39.830
(Gatomon humming affirmatively)

00:08:39.864 --> 00:08:42.500
So these clouds of black
bugs must be attacks

00:08:42.533 --> 00:08:44.335
sent out by that Digimon.

00:08:44.368 --> 00:08:46.504
Petaldramon will never stop.

00:08:46.537 --> 00:08:49.673
Even after being hurt from
fighting them, hurt bad,

00:08:49.707 --> 00:08:51.542
Petaldramon fights on.

00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:54.512
It sure would weigh you down,

00:08:54.545 --> 00:08:58.015
having to fight all those
black bugs over and over.

00:08:58.048 --> 00:08:59.183
(Tai humming grimly)

00:08:59.216 --> 00:09:02.853
(footsteps thudding)

00:09:02.887 --> 00:09:06.357
(Kari whimpering)

00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:08.192
(Kari grunting in determination)

00:09:08.225 --> 00:09:10.528
(all grunting in surprise)

00:09:10.561 --> 00:09:13.364
[Gatomon] Kari,
what are you doing?

00:09:13.397 --> 00:09:14.698
Wait!

00:09:14.732 --> 00:09:16.700
(leaves rustling)

00:09:16.734 --> 00:09:18.369
Kari, where are you going?

00:09:18.402 --> 00:09:23.407
-(Kari panting)
-(leaves rustling)

00:09:27.411 --> 00:09:29.380
Petaldramon!

00:09:29.413 --> 00:09:31.048
What are you doing?

00:09:31.081 --> 00:09:35.052
I wanted to say, thank you so
much for saving us earlier!

00:09:35.085 --> 00:09:37.555
(footsteps thudding)

00:09:37.588 --> 00:09:39.723
My name is Kari!

00:09:39.757 --> 00:09:42.927
And, well, I wanna
help you, if I can.

00:09:44.094 --> 00:09:47.064
Would it be okay if I
try to help you out?

00:09:47.097 --> 00:09:50.067
(Petaldramon humming)

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:52.236
(leaves rustling)

00:09:52.269 --> 00:09:53.737

(roots creaking)

00:09:55.272 --> 00:09:56.273
Huh?

00:10:02.112 --> 00:10:04.615

(all gasping)

00:10:10.621 --> 00:10:11.622
Kari?

00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.092
Don't worry.

00:10:15.125 --> 00:10:16.260
It's all right.

00:10:16.293 --> 00:10:18.929
(Tai gasping)

00:10:18.963 --> 00:10:19.964
Huh?

00:10:20.631 --> 00:10:22.933
(flowers popping)

00:10:22.967 --> 00:10:25.936
(all clamoring excitedly)

00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:27.438
They look delicious!

00:10:27.471 --> 00:10:28.439
Yeah!

00:10:28.472 --> 00:10:30.107
Does this mean we can eat 'em?

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:33.110
I know we're in a hurry
to complete our journey,

00:10:33.143 --> 00:10:36.614
but still, we also
need some rest.

00:10:36.647 --> 00:10:38.115
(fruit crunching)

00:10:38.148 --> 00:10:39.783
Such hospitality.

00:10:39.817 --> 00:10:41.318
How will we ever repay you?

00:10:42.319 --> 00:10:43.787
Gatomon.

00:10:43.821 --> 00:10:46.790
(all munching)

00:10:46.824 --> 00:10:48.792
Well, we're in too
deep now, anyway.

00:10:48.826 --> 00:10:50.127
(Tai chuckling)

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:52.830
(all chuckling)

00:10:55.165 --> 00:10:56.967
All right, we're in.

00:10:57.001 --> 00:11:00.471
Yeah! As human beings, we can't
just ignore what's happening.

00:11:00.504 --> 00:11:02.006
And we can't as Digimon, either!

00:11:02.506 --> 00:11:04.475
We all need to help
each other out!

00:11:04.508 --> 00:11:05.676
Yeah, exactly!

00:11:06.677 --> 00:11:08.145
(Kari giggling)

00:11:08.178 --> 00:11:11.515

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:51.689
Oh, man.

00:11:51.722 --> 00:11:54.358
Looks like they were just
lying in wait for Petaldramon.

00:11:54.391 --> 00:11:57.227

(all gasping)

00:12:21.251 --> 00:12:23.721
It's the black bugs!

00:12:23.754 --> 00:12:24.755
Agumon!

00:12:27.091 --> 00:12:28.759
Agumon digivolve to

00:12:41.271 --> 00:12:42.272
Greymon!

00:12:43.941 --> 00:12:46.910
(Greymon thudding)

00:12:46.944 --> 00:12:50.280
[TK] I'll back you
up with Pegasusmon!

00:12:51.615 --> 00:12:52.750
Listen up!

00:12:52.783 --> 00:12:54.618
Don't let those
bugs get any closer!

00:12:58.455 --> 00:13:03.460
Good luck, you guys.

00:13:04.294 --> 00:13:05.929
How do you like these apples?

00:13:05.963 --> 00:13:09.433
(all yelling battle cries)

00:13:09.466 --> 00:13:12.136

(Tai screaming)

00:13:14.471 --> 00:13:16.774
We won't let you
stop Petaldramon!

00:13:16.807 --> 00:13:18.275
(Togemon yelling battle cry)

00:13:18.308 --> 00:13:19.777

(all gasping in awe)

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:47.521
[Izzy] So is that...

00:13:47.554 --> 00:13:49.223
[Kabuterimon] The
black bugs' boss!

00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:53.026
[Izzy] It's an Ultimate
Digimon, Entmon.

-(monitor beeping)
-(Izzy gasping)

00:13:54.394 --> 00:13:55.896

(dramatic music)

00:14:02.736 --> 00:14:05.038
Gonna be a no from me!

(Greymon grunting)

00:14:06.907 --> 00:14:07.908

Watch out!

00:14:19.586 --> 00:14:21.054
What happened?

00:14:21.088 --> 00:14:24.224
It appears that some kind
of barrier has sprung up

00:14:24.258 --> 00:14:25.926
to separate us from Petaldramon!

00:14:27.094 --> 00:14:29.062
Do you think something
is trying to tell us

00:14:29.096 --> 00:14:30.097
not to interfere?

00:14:31.431 --> 00:14:33.567
But Kari's still
inside that thing!

[Izzy] The Digimon Encyclopedia!

00:22:42.756 --> 00:22:44.057
Burgermon!

00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:46.393
This Digimon is good
at making hamburgers.

00:22:46.426 --> 00:22:48.395
In fact, I hear the
burgers he makes

00:22:48.428 --> 00:22:50.397
from carefully selected
ingredient data

00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:51.765
are simply exquisite!

00:22:52.599 --> 00:22:54.067
Now let's check this out!

00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:55.402
That bun-shaped hat is proof

00:22:55.435 --> 00:22:57.237
of Burgermon's
love of hamburgers.

00:22:57.270 --> 00:22:58.571
Now, according to some people,

00:22:58.605 --> 00:23:00.573
burgers with pickles
on them are the best.

00:23:00.607 --> 00:23:03.576
And Burgermon picks pickles
that are the pickley-est!

00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:06.079
(heroic music)

00:23:06.112 --> 00:23:08.448
Which Digimon will
it be next time?

Gabumon save Machmon

00:23:13.119 --> 00:23:15.922
