WEBVTT

00:00:11.283 --> 00:00:14.586
[Izzy] Next up on the
Digimon encyclopedia is...

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:15.821
Gomamon!

00:00:15.854 --> 00:00:17.623
This Digimon is Joe's partner.

00:00:17.656 --> 00:00:20.759
Gomamon's white fur can
regulate body temperature,

00:00:20.792 --> 00:00:21.793
even underwater.

00:00:23.662 --> 00:00:25.797
Now let's check this out!

00:00:25.831 --> 00:00:27.666
The fish that appear
in Marching Fishes

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:29.668
are said to be
Gomamon's followers.

00:00:29.701 --> 00:00:32.938
Does that mean they wait
around on standby all the time?

00:00:32.971 --> 00:00:35.607
Now that's dedication!

00:00:35.641 --> 00:00:38.143
(futuristic sound)

00:00:38.176 --> 00:00:41.013
Which Digimon will
it be next time?

00:00:42.447 --> 00:00:43.415

[Narrator] As Tai's party moved

00:02:12.946 --> 00:02:14.581
through the maze-like canyon,

00:02:14.614 --> 00:02:16.950
Ultimate Digimon
Oukuwamon leading a swarm

00:02:16.983 --> 00:02:20.821
of Kuwagamon was lying
in wait to ambush them.

00:02:20.854 --> 00:02:22.422
(rocks crashing)

00:02:22.456 --> 00:02:23.657
Izzy couldn't understand

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.492
why his tablet
wouldn't work properly

00:02:25.525 --> 00:02:26.793
and became disheartened.

00:02:29.663 --> 00:02:32.132
But after a pep-talk
from Kabuterimon,

00:02:32.165 --> 00:02:33.967
he was back to himself.

00:02:35.135 --> 00:02:37.003
Izzy turned the tables
on their attackers

00:02:37.037 --> 00:02:40.006
using only his own
ideas and ingenuity.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.476
Which gave them the
opening they needed.

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.613
(rocks crashing)

00:02:46.646 --> 00:02:48.348
Inspired by Izzy's resolve,

00:02:48.381 --> 00:02:51.818
Kabuterimon digivolved
into MegaKabuterimon

00:02:52.986 --> 00:02:55.522
and successfully
defeated Oukuwamon.

00:02:57.057 --> 00:02:59.392
(explosion)

00:03:09.703 --> 00:03:11.838
There might be good spot
to land around here.

00:03:11.872 --> 00:03:13.507
What do you think, Birdramon?

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:14.541
Sounds good!

00:03:16.743 --> 00:03:20.213
(futuristic vibrations)

00:03:20.247 --> 00:03:22.649
(exhausted grunt)
I need to rest for a bit.

00:03:22.682 --> 00:03:25.318
Well you did fly all of
us the whole way here.

00:03:25.352 --> 00:03:26.887
We appreciate it, Biyomon.

00:03:27.754 --> 00:03:29.689
Are we finally back on land?

00:03:29.723 --> 00:03:31.024
You're a real trooper, Joe.

00:03:31.057 --> 00:03:32.392
Thanks for hanging in there.

00:03:32.425 --> 00:03:34.494
The rendezvous point
with Tai's group

00:03:34.528 --> 00:03:36.997
shouldn't be too far
from our location.

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.266
I don't know if
we can walk there.

00:03:40.433 --> 00:03:42.736
For one, there's a
huge river in our way.

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:45.438
And I don't think we'll
be able to swim across it.

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.842
That's where our Digi-buddy
Gomamon comes in.

00:03:48.875 --> 00:03:51.578
You betcha, that
river's nothing!

00:03:51.611 --> 00:03:53.847
But first we have to
cross this mountain.

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.349
Right! I should be
able to handle that.

00:03:56.383 --> 00:03:57.551
That's perfect.

00:03:57.584 --> 00:03:59.352
This way you'll be
able to rest, Biyomon.

00:03:59.386 --> 00:04:02.022
Once we cross the river,
I'll be able to fly us

00:04:02.055 --> 00:04:03.256
the rest of the way.

00:04:03.557 --> 00:04:05.358
They said my turn's coming up.

00:04:05.392 --> 00:04:07.260
That means we're crossing
the river then...

00:04:07.294 --> 00:04:08.762
I guess that's okay.

00:04:08.795 --> 00:04:11.097
Those two are doing
all the strategizing

00:04:11.131 --> 00:04:12.365
for our group now.

00:04:12.399 --> 00:04:14.367
All you gotta do
is sit around and

00:04:14.401 --> 00:04:16.336
look important while
they do all the work.

00:04:16.369 --> 00:04:17.537
I see!

00:04:17.571 --> 00:04:19.372
Then as the leader,
I'll be supervising.

00:04:19.406 --> 00:04:20.774
Yeah! That's it!

00:04:20.807 --> 00:04:21.942
(ground rumbles)

00:04:21.975 --> 00:04:22.943
Huh?

00:04:22.976 --> 00:04:25.312
(screaming)

00:04:28.982 --> 00:04:30.317
What's that noise?

00:04:31.251 --> 00:04:34.321
(footsteps stomping)

00:04:41.595 --> 00:04:44.164
(Joe screaming)

00:04:48.435 --> 00:04:50.737
What is that thing?
It's terrifying.

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.806
That's an ultimate
Digimon, Mammon!

00:04:54.007 --> 00:04:56.176
[Gabumon] And those are
Yukidarumon next to it.

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:58.011
Here it comes.

00:04:59.679 --> 00:05:01.314
(intense music)

00:05:01.348 --> 00:05:03.016
Watch out, everyone!

00:05:05.352 --> 00:05:07.687
(screaming)

00:05:10.957 --> 00:05:12.425
Sora!

00:05:12.459 --> 00:05:14.761
(Biyomon screams)

00:05:14.794 --> 00:05:15.795
Biyomon!

00:05:18.798 --> 00:05:20.934
(Sora wails)

00:05:20.967 --> 00:05:21.935
(grunting)

00:05:21.968 --> 00:05:23.003
Are you okay?

00:05:23.036 --> 00:05:24.437
Hang on...

00:05:24.471 --> 00:05:25.972
Marching Fishes!

00:05:31.144 --> 00:05:32.112
What happened?

00:05:32.145 --> 00:05:33.346
Sora...

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:35.482
Why is it spreading?

00:05:35.515 --> 00:05:36.650
Break that ice!

00:05:43.223 --> 00:05:45.225
(grunts)

00:05:46.359 --> 00:05:47.794
It's still there.

00:05:47.827 --> 00:05:48.828
Hang in there.

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:51.798
(Mammon roars)

00:05:51.831 --> 00:05:52.832
Now what is it?

00:05:55.168 --> 00:05:58.571
(hooves stomp on ground)

00:06:04.077 --> 00:06:05.512
He's up to something.

00:06:11.685 --> 00:06:14.654
(snow roaring)

00:06:14.688 --> 00:06:16.189
It's an avalanche!

00:06:20.727 --> 00:06:21.728
Gabumon!

00:06:24.698 --> 00:06:26.866
We're not gonna make it!

00:06:32.906 --> 00:06:34.674
[Tai] Whoa!

00:06:34.708 --> 00:06:36.343
This place is crazy,

00:06:36.376 --> 00:06:37.577
look how giant it is!

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:39.746
Seems like a whole
lot of nothing.

00:06:39.779 --> 00:06:42.916
Anyway, which way do you think
we should go from here, Izzy?

00:06:42.949 --> 00:06:44.417
I'm looking that up now.

00:06:44.451 --> 00:06:45.552
Seems like...

00:06:45.585 --> 00:06:48.254
(panicked screaming)

00:06:48.288 --> 00:06:49.589
What's she doing?

00:06:49.622 --> 00:06:51.224
Get me off of this thing!

00:06:51.257 --> 00:06:53.526
Wahh! I can't slow them down!

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:54.694
[All] Huh?

00:06:54.728 --> 00:06:56.930
It's a Kiwimon stampede!

00:06:56.963 --> 00:06:58.765
Why is she riding one?

00:06:58.798 --> 00:07:02.535
They were just so cute,
I couldn't help it, okay?

00:07:02.569 --> 00:07:03.536
It's no use,

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:05.405
I can't get them to stop!

00:07:05.438 --> 00:07:06.406
On the bright side,

00:07:06.439 --> 00:07:07.907
we're actually
headed the right way.

00:07:07.941 --> 00:07:11.444
[Tai And Mimi] That's
not important right now!

00:07:18.051 --> 00:07:19.953
[Matt] Looks like we
managed to lose them.

00:07:19.986 --> 00:07:21.721
[Joe] I thought we were goners.

00:07:21.755 --> 00:07:24.224
We owe you one for
sure, Garurumon.

00:07:24.257 --> 00:07:25.458
My pleasure.

00:07:25.492 --> 00:07:27.127
However...

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.128
Sora...

00:07:28.161 --> 00:07:29.462
[Gomamon] It looks
like the ice on her leg

00:07:29.496 --> 00:07:32.065
from Yukidarumon's
attack is still there.

00:07:32.098 --> 00:07:34.067
It just me or is it spreading?

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:36.102
We need to get her out
of this cold environment

00:07:36.136 --> 00:07:38.571
or it's just going
to keep escalating.

00:07:38.605 --> 00:07:39.906
So it's like...

00:07:39.939 --> 00:07:41.041
an ice virus?

00:07:41.074 --> 00:07:43.743
Yeah, so we need to hurry
and find a way to melt it.

00:07:43.777 --> 00:07:45.145
Oh, don't worry about me.

00:07:45.178 --> 00:07:46.279
This is nothing.

00:07:46.312 --> 00:07:48.448
(shouts in pain)

00:07:48.481 --> 00:07:49.482
You poor thing.

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:52.652
My fire... I can melt it!

00:07:52.685 --> 00:07:54.454
[Garurumon] Biyomon.

00:07:54.487 --> 00:07:55.822
Don't be rash.

00:07:55.855 --> 00:07:58.124
That would only
injure Sora more.

00:07:58.158 --> 00:08:00.994
Even making a fire to warm
her up would be risky here.

00:08:01.027 --> 00:08:02.395
We'll carry her on Garurumon

00:08:02.429 --> 00:08:03.830
to the bottom of the mountain.

00:08:03.863 --> 00:08:06.466
(Mammon roars)

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:13.139
There are more of
those Yukidarumon.

00:08:13.173 --> 00:08:14.908
I bet they think
we were swallowed

00:08:14.941 --> 00:08:17.477
up by that avalanche and
are trying to find us.

00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:18.511
You might be right.

00:08:18.545 --> 00:08:20.113
Someone needs to draw them away.

00:08:20.146 --> 00:08:22.282
Think you can do it?

00:08:22.315 --> 00:08:24.284
You betcha! Just leave it to us!

00:08:24.317 --> 00:08:25.318
Huh?

00:08:28.354 --> 00:08:30.723
(whimpering)

00:08:35.161 --> 00:08:38.331
(struggled breathing)

00:08:39.499 --> 00:08:40.467
We can do it.

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:41.468
Right, Gomamon?

00:08:41.501 --> 00:08:42.502
Mhmm!

00:08:46.906 --> 00:08:49.209
(snowball thumps)

00:08:49.242 --> 00:08:51.044
Over here, you big jerk!

00:08:51.077 --> 00:08:52.812
Catch me if you can!

00:08:52.846 --> 00:08:55.181
(screaming)

00:08:59.586 --> 00:09:00.887
Go Ikkakumon!

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:01.921
On it.

00:09:06.759 --> 00:09:07.727
It's working,

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:08.895
they're following us.

00:09:08.928 --> 00:09:10.864
And there are more
coming from the left.

00:09:12.265 --> 00:09:15.902
Perfect! That means all the
Yukidarumon are here, right?

00:09:15.935 --> 00:09:18.037
Except for Mammon.

00:09:19.772 --> 00:09:21.407
There he is!

00:09:21.441 --> 00:09:22.909
[Ikkakumon] Ready, Joe?

00:09:22.942 --> 00:09:23.943
Let's do it.

00:09:24.878 --> 00:09:29.883
Harpoon Torpedo!

00:09:33.052 --> 00:09:35.188
Alright, now hit him again!

00:09:35.221 --> 00:09:36.523
You got it!

00:09:36.556 --> 00:09:39.559
(harpoons crashing)

00:09:44.063 --> 00:09:45.732
(Mammon roars)

00:09:45.765 --> 00:09:47.367
Here they come!

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:48.935
Hello? Can you guys hear me?

00:09:48.968 --> 00:09:49.936
This is Joe.

00:09:49.969 --> 00:09:51.437
It really worked!

00:09:51.471 --> 00:09:53.873
We managed to lure them
away, but I don't know...

00:09:53.907 --> 00:09:56.276
Understood, we'll make
the run for it now.

00:09:56.309 --> 00:09:57.944
Let's get going Garurumon.

00:09:57.977 --> 00:09:58.978
Gotcha!

00:10:01.915 --> 00:10:05.084
(synth music playing)

00:10:05.985 --> 00:10:07.954
[Ikkakumon] Think we should
head toward the river?

00:10:07.987 --> 00:10:08.955
[Joe] Yeah.

00:10:08.988 --> 00:10:10.557
Since everyone else
is going upstream,

00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:12.992
we can go downstream to
lure them even further away.

00:10:13.826 --> 00:10:14.827
Good thinking.

00:10:16.429 --> 00:10:18.064
Hold on tight, Joe.

00:10:18.097 --> 00:10:19.098
Huh?

00:10:19.933 --> 00:10:22.268
(screaming)

00:10:23.937 --> 00:10:25.104
Not a crevasse!

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:36.282
Ha! Take that, you jerks!

00:10:37.517 --> 00:10:41.921
(intense orchestral music)

00:10:41.955 --> 00:10:46.826
[Both] Run!

00:10:48.828 --> 00:10:51.164
(screaming)

00:10:51.197 --> 00:10:54.517
This whole mission's impossible!

00:11:07.822 --> 00:11:09.724
It looks like we
managed to lose them.

00:11:09.757 --> 00:11:10.792
Yeah.

00:11:10.825 --> 00:11:12.226
The coast is clear now!

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.462
That was seriously awful.

00:11:14.495 --> 00:11:16.898
Promise me the next time
you see a cute Digimon

00:11:16.931 --> 00:11:19.233
you give me a heads
up before hopping on?

00:11:19.267 --> 00:11:20.268
Fine.

00:11:21.102 --> 00:11:23.471
(wind echoes)

00:11:23.504 --> 00:11:24.472
Huh?

00:11:24.505 --> 00:11:25.607
What's the matter?

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:26.808
I felt a breeze coming

00:11:26.841 --> 00:11:29.110
from the other side
of the cave just now.

00:11:29.143 --> 00:11:30.144
You did?

00:11:31.312 --> 00:11:34.749
If wind is able to pass
through this cave that means...

00:11:34.782 --> 00:11:37.485
there must be another entrance
on the other side of it!

00:11:40.188 --> 00:11:42.957
You think it leads to the
other side of the mountain?

00:11:46.361 --> 00:11:48.329
(grunting)

00:11:48.363 --> 00:11:50.498
(screaming)

00:11:50.531 --> 00:11:52.433
[Joe] Can't you slide
any faster than this?

00:11:52.467 --> 00:11:55.436
[Ikkakumon] I can't,
there's too many trees!

00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:57.338
(Mammon roars)

00:11:57.372 --> 00:11:59.440
[Joe] They're gaining
on us, Ikkakumon.

00:11:59.474 --> 00:12:01.342
We've come down pretty far.

00:12:01.376 --> 00:12:03.511
You gotta be able to
see the river, right?

00:12:03.544 --> 00:12:05.179
I can't see it yet,

00:12:05.213 --> 00:12:07.615
but you just hold on, Joe!

00:12:07.649 --> 00:12:09.651
We're doomed! They're
gonna catch us!

00:12:10.718 --> 00:12:14.322
(intense orchestral music)

00:12:24.165 --> 00:12:26.367
One's coming at us
from the high ground!

00:12:26.401 --> 00:12:27.402
Watch out!

00:12:31.205 --> 00:12:33.341
Look how much distance we got.

00:12:33.374 --> 00:12:36.010
They can't keep up
with us anymore.

00:12:36.044 --> 00:12:37.879
Joe, hang on!

00:12:37.912 --> 00:12:40.248
(screaming)

00:12:44.385 --> 00:12:46.688
(screaming)

00:12:48.856 --> 00:12:50.525
That was close.

00:12:50.558 --> 00:12:51.893
Huh?

00:12:51.926 --> 00:12:54.162
(Mammon roaring)

00:12:54.195 --> 00:12:57.665
So they were just herding
us here the whole time?

00:12:57.699 --> 00:13:00.234
[Ikkakumon] Well, what
do we do now, Joe?

00:13:00.268 --> 00:13:01.669
Don't ask me that.

00:13:01.703 --> 00:13:04.105
I'm not in charge of
coming up with the plans.

00:13:08.109 --> 00:13:09.243
It's no use.

00:13:09.277 --> 00:13:11.746
How are we supposed to win
against a Digimon that big?

00:13:11.779 --> 00:13:14.849
Remember what's at
stake if we lose.

00:13:14.882 --> 00:13:16.718
Remember our role here.

00:13:18.619 --> 00:13:20.188
That's right.

00:13:20.221 --> 00:13:23.091
Our role is to distract
these guys long enough

00:13:23.124 --> 00:13:24.559
to get Sora to safety.

00:13:25.793 --> 00:13:26.761
You got it!

00:13:26.794 --> 00:13:28.563
So let's go!

00:13:28.596 --> 00:13:31.265
Let's play our part and
do what we need to do!

00:13:32.133 --> 00:13:33.134
All right.

00:13:34.068 --> 00:13:35.803
We just have to stop them here.

00:13:36.471 --> 00:13:37.438
Stop.

00:13:37.472 --> 00:13:38.473
Stop.

00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:45.079
I know what to do!

00:13:45.113 --> 00:13:47.215
Ikkakumon, aim for that spot.

00:13:47.248 --> 00:13:49.383
That's where Mammon's
going to step next.

00:13:49.417 --> 00:13:50.451
Roger that!

00:13:56.591 --> 00:13:57.592
Now, fire!

00:13:58.593 --> 00:14:02.230
(Ikkakumon grunts)

00:14:02.263 --> 00:14:05.800
(intense orchestral music)

00:14:06.968 --> 00:14:08.569
[Both] It worked!

00:14:08.603 --> 00:14:11.172
(ice cracking)

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:15.009
Wait a second, now
what's happening?

00:14:20.615 --> 00:14:22.950
(screaming)

00:14:32.126 --> 00:14:33.828
(both grunting)

00:14:33.861 --> 00:14:35.463
You okay?

00:14:35.496 --> 00:14:37.165
I think so.

00:14:37.198 --> 00:14:38.199
Ah!

00:14:38.966 --> 00:14:40.301
It's the river.

00:14:40.334 --> 00:14:41.469
We made it.

00:14:42.970 --> 00:14:44.839
That was amazing, Joe.

00:14:44.872 --> 00:14:46.941
You got us outta there.

00:14:46.974 --> 00:14:48.176
(Joe laughing)

00:14:48.209 --> 00:14:50.645
It was all part of my
plan from the start.

00:14:53.381 --> 00:14:56.450
(Mammon roars)

00:14:56.484 --> 00:14:58.319
They just don't give up!

00:14:58.352 --> 00:15:00.855
Was this part of your plan, too?

00:15:00.888 --> 00:15:01.856
Hurry!

00:15:01.889 --> 00:15:02.890
Just cross the river!

00:15:04.025 --> 00:15:06.661
(Mammon roars)

00:15:13.234 --> 00:15:15.570
All right, we were
able to stall them.

00:15:18.739 --> 00:15:20.208
We should be fine now.

00:15:20.241 --> 00:15:22.643
(beeping)

00:15:22.677 --> 00:15:24.879
What's the situation
over there with you guys?

00:15:24.912 --> 00:15:27.815
We've managed to cross
the river safely.

00:15:27.849 --> 00:15:29.483
(Joe laughs over device)

00:15:29.517 --> 00:15:30.685
How's Sora?

00:15:30.718 --> 00:15:33.221
She's resting next to
the fire right now.

00:15:33.254 --> 00:15:34.689
The ice should melt soon.

00:15:36.924 --> 00:15:37.892
Thank goodness.

00:15:37.925 --> 00:15:39.827
We're crossing the
river at the moment.

00:15:39.861 --> 00:15:41.796
We managed to shake them off.

00:15:41.829 --> 00:15:44.665
You should be able to see the
smoke on the opposite bank.

00:15:44.699 --> 00:15:46.534
We're located directly under it.

00:15:46.567 --> 00:15:48.169
[Ikkakumon] Look, over there.

00:15:48.202 --> 00:15:49.503
[Joe] Okay, Ikkakumon.

00:15:49.537 --> 00:15:51.072
Full speed ahead.

00:15:51.105 --> 00:15:54.041
(Mammon roars)

00:15:54.075 --> 00:15:56.244
Come on, seriously?

00:15:56.277 --> 00:15:59.881
(intense orchestral music)

00:16:08.923 --> 00:16:11.525
The river water's
being frozen over!

00:16:11.559 --> 00:16:12.727
[Ikkakumon] If we
stay in the water,

00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:15.062
we'll be turned into
ice along with it!

00:16:15.096 --> 00:16:16.097
Then hurry up!

00:16:17.131 --> 00:16:19.600
(Ikkakumon yelps)

00:16:19.634 --> 00:16:22.136
(Joe screams)

00:16:23.938 --> 00:16:25.740
Gonna feel that in the morning.

00:16:27.141 --> 00:16:30.211
No way!

00:16:30.244 --> 00:16:32.647
That's so not fair.

00:16:34.415 --> 00:16:36.117
[Matt over Digivice]
Joe, what's wrong?

00:16:36.984 --> 00:16:38.252
They just keep coming.

00:16:46.427 --> 00:16:48.296
(Joe screams)

00:16:48.329 --> 00:16:49.330
Joe!

00:16:50.331 --> 00:16:52.767
(explosions)

00:16:53.668 --> 00:16:56.570
We have no choice but to fight.

00:16:56.604 --> 00:16:59.640
We can't let them
cross over this bridge.

00:16:59.674 --> 00:17:01.409
But they're too strong.

00:17:01.442 --> 00:17:02.843
Besides...

00:17:07.448 --> 00:17:10.318
(Ikkakumon grunts)

00:17:11.319 --> 00:17:12.620
Ikkakumon!

00:17:12.653 --> 00:17:14.088
You can't fight like that.

00:17:14.121 --> 00:17:16.958
Not when it's only us.

00:17:16.991 --> 00:17:18.960
Sora still can't move.

00:17:18.993 --> 00:17:22.964
If they get past us,
everyone will be in danger.

00:17:22.997 --> 00:17:26.133
(gentle flute music)

00:17:27.702 --> 00:17:28.869
Then Sora...

00:17:30.304 --> 00:17:31.939
We can do this.

00:17:31.973 --> 00:17:33.641
We can protect everyone.

00:17:33.674 --> 00:17:35.843
Come on, Joe!

00:17:35.876 --> 00:17:36.877
You're right.

00:17:38.212 --> 00:17:39.213
Sora...

00:17:40.014 --> 00:17:41.349
(beeping)

00:17:41.382 --> 00:17:42.783
This is Matt.

00:17:42.817 --> 00:17:44.185
What's going on over there?

00:17:44.218 --> 00:17:46.387
I can come help you
if things are bad.

00:17:48.823 --> 00:17:49.824
Thank you.

00:17:49.857 --> 00:17:52.159
But there's no need to worry.

00:17:52.193 --> 00:17:53.828
We can handle it.

00:17:53.861 --> 00:17:56.797
We can't afford to leave
Sora alone right now.

00:17:56.831 --> 00:17:59.650
So just stay there
and protect her.

00:18:07.391 --> 00:18:09.994
It's just you and me, Ikkakumon.

00:18:10.027 --> 00:18:11.529
And we're gonna stop these guys,

00:18:11.562 --> 00:18:13.164
right here, right now!

00:18:13.197 --> 00:18:18.202
That's the spirit!

00:18:19.337 --> 00:18:23.341
(futuristic noises
from Digivice)

00:18:25.343 --> 00:18:26.344
Let's do this.

00:18:27.578 --> 00:18:29.547
Alright!

00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:31.982
Ikkakumon!

00:18:32.016 --> 00:18:33.250
Digivolve to...

00:18:36.687 --> 00:18:40.424
(singing in Japanese)

00:18:45.196 --> 00:18:46.197
Zudomon!

00:18:48.366 --> 00:18:49.367
Alright!

00:18:55.072 --> 00:18:57.775
(Zudomon grunts)

00:19:01.045 --> 00:19:03.714
(Zudomon roars)

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:18.763
(Zudomon grunts)

00:19:23.901 --> 00:19:26.804
(lighting strikes)

00:20:07.344 --> 00:20:08.345
Nice job.

[Male TV News Host] It is
now day 3 of the blackout.

00:20:23.828 --> 00:20:26.597
As emergency power begins
to come back online,

00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:28.466
electronic devices
connected to the internet

00:20:28.499 --> 00:20:31.469
continue to operate erratically.

00:20:31.502 --> 00:20:34.104
All disaster information
continues to be updated

00:20:34.138 --> 00:20:37.007
on each region's
official website.

00:20:37.041 --> 00:20:39.610
The government recommends
all citizens carry a device

00:20:39.643 --> 00:20:42.513
to stay connected to the
internet at all times.

00:20:44.548 --> 00:20:46.016

Birdramon!

00:20:51.322 --> 00:20:53.290
Are you feeling
better now, Sora?

00:20:53.324 --> 00:20:56.026
Yeah. And it's all thanks
to you and Gomamon

00:20:56.060 --> 00:20:57.495
that I could fully recover.

00:20:58.562 --> 00:21:01.298
Well, I only did
what any great leader

00:21:01.332 --> 00:21:03.133
would've done back there.

00:21:03.167 --> 00:21:04.502
(Gomamon chuckles)

00:21:04.535 --> 00:21:06.136
[Birdramon] All set everyone?

00:21:06.170 --> 00:21:08.539
I'm ready to fly again.

00:21:08.572 --> 00:21:09.840
We should head out soon.

00:21:10.741 --> 00:21:12.543
Ready when you are, leader.

00:21:12.576 --> 00:21:14.144
We're awaiting your command.

00:21:14.178 --> 00:21:15.713
All right, listen up, you guys.

00:21:15.746 --> 00:21:17.214
Let's go.
Right behind you, Matt!

00:21:17.248 --> 00:21:18.215
Hey!

00:21:18.249 --> 00:21:20.050
I wasn't done yet!

[Mimi] Are we there yet?

00:21:32.096 --> 00:21:33.531
I dunno about you,

00:21:33.564 --> 00:21:35.733
but this place is
starting to creep me out.

00:21:35.766 --> 00:21:37.835
Yeah, I think I
know what you mean.

00:21:37.868 --> 00:21:39.570
Even though it's hard
to tell in the dark,

00:21:39.603 --> 00:21:42.072
it just doesn't feel
like a real cave to me.

00:21:42.106 --> 00:21:44.041
And the walls and
ground are all slippery.

00:21:44.074 --> 00:21:45.075
Oh Look!

00:21:48.779 --> 00:21:49.747
