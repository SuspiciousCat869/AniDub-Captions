I can hear you, but
I can't see you.

00:10:52.494 --> 00:10:53.828
What is happening?

00:10:56.231 --> 00:10:57.832
[Sora] Biyomon?

00:10:57.866 --> 00:11:00.502
[Biyomon] I'm here, I think?

00:11:00.535 --> 00:11:02.904
[Tentomon] Oh good, at
least we're not alone.

00:11:04.906 --> 00:11:06.241
[Izzy] This is...

00:11:09.377 --> 00:11:11.346
Our world, isn't it?

00:11:14.516 --> 00:11:16.251
[Joe] What's
happening right now?

00:11:17.352 --> 00:11:19.721
[Gomamon] The
Digital World is...

00:11:19.754 --> 00:11:21.389
[Joe] Gomamon?

00:11:21.423 --> 00:11:23.658
[Gomamon] Joe, is that you?

00:11:23.692 --> 00:11:25.327
[Joe] That's weird.

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:27.529
I can't see you, but
I know you're there.

00:11:29.197 --> 00:11:31.499
[Palmon] This is too strange.

00:11:31.533 --> 00:11:33.201
I don't like it one bit.

00:11:33.235 --> 00:11:35.003
[Mimi] Don't tell me we're stuck

00:11:35.036 --> 00:11:37.706
floating around
as ghosts forever.

00:11:37.739 --> 00:11:40.175
[Izzy] Is this Negamon's power?

00:11:40.208 --> 00:11:44.012
If Negamon devoured our
very existence then...

00:11:44.045 --> 00:11:46.715
[Tentomon] Does that mean
we're just leftovers?

00:11:46.748 --> 00:11:49.684
[Biyomon] I'm starting
to feel sleepy.

00:11:49.718 --> 00:11:51.353
[Sora] You can't!

00:11:51.386 --> 00:11:53.855
If we lose consciousness now,

00:11:53.888 --> 00:11:56.057
then that really will
be the end for us.

00:11:56.891 --> 00:11:59.928
But, if we stay like this,

00:11:59.961 --> 00:12:01.863
we won't be able to do anything.

00:12:01.896 --> 00:12:04.566
(intense music)

00:12:09.571 --> 00:12:10.739
(Wargreymon grunts)

00:12:10.772 --> 00:12:12.941
(Tai pants)

00:12:12.974 --> 00:12:15.543
(intense music)

00:12:15.577 --> 00:12:18.546
(Metalgarurumon grunts)

00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:21.082
(Tai grunts)

00:12:21.116 --> 00:12:24.619
[Argomon] Driven by this
unstoppable impulse.

00:12:24.653 --> 00:12:26.955
Negamon will consume all,

00:12:26.988 --> 00:12:29.224
consume every existence,

00:12:29.257 --> 00:12:31.960
and evolve into the
ultimate destruction

00:12:31.993 --> 00:12:34.763
where nothing's born
or will ever begin.

00:12:35.997 --> 00:12:37.932
The absolute end.

00:12:37.966 --> 00:12:40.669
(suspense music)

00:12:42.837 --> 00:12:44.306
Got any fight left in ya?

00:12:44.339 --> 00:12:46.975
Yeah, I think I can still move.

00:12:47.008 --> 00:12:50.145
Metalgarurumon, it's up to us.

00:12:50.178 --> 00:12:51.613
Hang on a little longer.

00:12:51.646 --> 00:12:55.817
Don't worry, I'll get up
as many times as I need to.

00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:58.920
(intense music)

00:12:58.953 --> 00:13:02.490
(Tai and Wargreymon roars)

00:13:02.524 --> 00:13:04.759
[Sora] That's Tai and Matt.

00:13:04.793 --> 00:13:05.994
(Izzy exclaims)

00:13:06.027 --> 00:13:09.097
[Izzy] They're still out
there fighting even now!

00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:11.800
(intense music)

00:13:24.379 --> 00:13:28.116
[Palmon] Wargreymon
and Metalgarurumon...

00:13:28.149 --> 00:13:29.951
They're still fighting.

00:13:29.984 --> 00:13:32.153
(intense music)

00:13:32.187 --> 00:13:35.490
(Metalgarurumon roars)

00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:40.228
Terra Force!

00:13:41.663 --> 00:13:44.332
(intense music)

00:13:49.904 --> 00:13:52.741
(Negamon booming)

00:13:53.908 --> 00:13:56.644
(intense music)

00:13:56.678 --> 00:13:59.881
(fire roaring)

00:13:59.914 --> 00:14:02.550
[Joe] It's not over
until we say it is

00:14:02.584 --> 00:14:04.719
and I'm not giving up!

00:14:04.753 --> 00:14:06.888
[Mimi] There has to
be something we can do

00:14:06.921 --> 00:14:08.890
to get back in there and help.

00:14:08.923 --> 00:14:11.860
(mechanical music)

00:14:25.407 --> 00:14:26.408
You can do it!

00:14:27.776 --> 00:14:30.011
(fire roaring)

00:14:30.044 --> 00:14:33.014
We never back down
and never give up!

00:14:33.047 --> 00:14:37.352
Your first mistake was
underestimating our true power!

00:14:37.385 --> 00:14:38.586
-Big brother!
-Big brother!

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:42.257
-(laser swooshing)
-(Seraphimon grunts)

00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:43.858
(Seraphimon grunts)

00:14:43.892 --> 00:14:45.360
(Seraphimon groans)

00:14:45.393 --> 00:14:47.195
-Seraphimon!
-(Ophanimon grunts)

00:14:47.228 --> 00:14:50.131
(light swooshing)

00:14:51.733 --> 00:14:59.099
(Negamon booming)

00:15:03.436 --> 00:15:04.838
[Izzy] Huh? Ah.

00:15:06.439 --> 00:15:09.609
[Tentomon] Huh? What is that?

00:15:09.642 --> 00:15:12.312
(magical music)

00:15:20.153 --> 00:15:21.921
[Izzy] Ah, huh?

00:15:21.955 --> 00:15:24.624
(magical music)

00:15:30.463 --> 00:15:31.865
It feels so warm.

00:15:32.866 --> 00:15:34.467
Huh? What's happening?

00:15:34.501 --> 00:15:36.102
My goodness!

00:15:36.136 --> 00:15:38.805
(magical music)

00:15:48.047 --> 00:15:49.349
Wow, these lights...

00:15:49.382 --> 00:15:51.117
They look familiar!

00:15:51.151 --> 00:15:53.853
(peaceful music)

00:16:00.393 --> 00:16:02.529
They're the lights from before!

00:16:02.562 --> 00:16:04.330
This is the light of hope.

00:16:04.364 --> 00:16:07.534
Is it coming from
the human world, too?

00:16:07.567 --> 00:16:08.835
How is that possible?

00:16:08.868 --> 00:16:10.970
-(device ringing)
-(Izzy and Sora gasps)

00:16:11.004 --> 00:16:13.706
(peaceful music)

00:16:15.041 --> 00:16:16.342
Huh?

00:16:16.376 --> 00:16:17.377
Voices.

00:16:18.178 --> 00:16:19.679
I can hear voices.

00:16:22.048 --> 00:16:23.383
You can do it.

00:16:25.919 --> 00:16:28.988
They're cheering for us!

00:16:29.022 --> 00:16:30.523
[Tentomon] You mean
there are people

00:16:30.557 --> 00:16:32.358
all the way in the human world

00:16:32.392 --> 00:16:35.662
who can sense we're fighting?

00:16:35.695 --> 00:16:39.199
[Izzy] Yeah, and all
their messages, prayers,

00:16:39.232 --> 00:16:41.901
and wishes are being
converted into data

00:16:41.935 --> 00:16:45.838
so powerful that it bypasses
the network entirely.

00:16:45.872 --> 00:16:48.841
This positive energy
opposes the negative energy

00:16:48.875 --> 00:16:50.843
that Negamon feeds on.

00:16:50.877 --> 00:16:52.045
The light of hope!

00:16:53.213 --> 00:16:54.714
Hmm.

00:16:54.747 --> 00:16:57.283
I promise to give it my all!

00:16:58.585 --> 00:17:01.354
Maybe the only reason
this phenomenon happened

00:17:01.387 --> 00:17:03.890
is because Negamon caused
the world's borders

00:17:03.923 --> 00:17:05.258
to collapse on themselves.

00:17:05.291 --> 00:17:08.094
I didn't understand half
of what you just said,

00:17:08.127 --> 00:17:10.697
but Izzy, doesn't this
mean we have a chance

00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:14.734
to turn the tables on
Negamon and end this crisis?

00:17:14.767 --> 00:17:17.704
Every one of these lights
symbolizes someone out there

00:17:17.737 --> 00:17:19.205
who believes in us.

00:17:19.239 --> 00:17:22.141
Then it's our duty to live
up to their expectations!

00:17:23.109 --> 00:17:25.478
You might just do it, yes.

00:17:25.511 --> 00:17:28.548
You children might be
able to perform a miracle

00:17:28.581 --> 00:17:31.484
even greater than that of
defeating Millenniummon.

00:17:32.085 --> 00:17:35.054
A miracle!

00:17:35.088 --> 00:17:36.556
[Everyone] A miracle!

00:17:36.589 --> 00:17:39.492
(triumphant music)

00:18:03.616 --> 00:18:05.084
Let's focus this energy

00:18:05.118 --> 00:18:06.619
and send it to Tai's side.

00:18:07.787 --> 00:18:09.656
It's gonna take
everything we've got.

00:18:09.689 --> 00:18:11.824
Are you with me
HerculesKabuterimon?

00:18:11.858 --> 00:18:13.626
Oh, we're not done yet.

00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:15.962
When Izzy puts his
mind to something,

00:18:15.995 --> 00:18:17.664
nothing can stop him!

00:18:17.697 --> 00:18:19.832
Phoenixmon, together!

00:18:19.866 --> 00:18:21.768
Nothing would make me happier

00:18:21.801 --> 00:18:24.771
than fighting by
your side to the end!

00:18:24.804 --> 00:18:26.773
Let's do this, Rosemon!

00:18:26.806 --> 00:18:29.609
We have to give it our
all no matter what!

00:18:29.642 --> 00:18:30.777
Let's go, Vikemon!

00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:33.546
If we fight together,
we can do it!

00:18:35.481 --> 00:18:36.983
[Devimon] I hear it.

00:18:37.016 --> 00:18:40.153
(triumphant music)

00:18:40.186 --> 00:18:41.187
Huh?

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:42.288
Oh!

00:18:42.322 --> 00:18:43.323
I hear it.

00:18:44.691 --> 00:18:47.860
The voices that are resonating
beyond the Digital World,

00:18:47.894 --> 00:18:50.863
gathering hope in
the form of light.

00:18:50.897 --> 00:18:53.199
Despite the destruction at hand,

00:18:53.232 --> 00:18:56.869
the hope shines brighter
than ever before.

00:18:56.903 --> 00:19:00.306
And now, it's
creating a miracle.

00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:04.310
Then the whim of us shadows
must also do the same.

00:19:04.344 --> 00:19:06.012
I see now.

00:19:06.045 --> 00:19:08.715
So this is the
answer you reached.

00:19:08.748 --> 00:19:12.518
Well done, dear friend.

00:19:12.552 --> 00:19:13.986
(TK grunts)

00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:15.822
(Kari grunts)

00:19:15.855 --> 00:19:18.558
[Seraphimon and Ophanimon]
Light of hope, heed my call!

00:19:18.591 --> 00:19:22.562
Gather here and lend
me your strength!

00:19:22.595 --> 00:19:23.730
(Sora gasps)

00:19:23.763 --> 00:19:27.333
-(Sora grunts)
-(Izzy grunts)

00:19:27.367 --> 00:19:30.036
(digimon roars)

00:19:30.069 --> 00:19:32.405
(digimon roars)

00:19:32.438 --> 00:19:35.375
(triumphant music)

00:19:45.284 --> 00:19:47.954
(intense music)

00:20:19.252 --> 00:20:20.253
Whoa!

00:20:21.254 --> 00:20:23.923
(intense music)

00:20:30.263 --> 00:20:33.566
(light swooshing)

00:20:33.599 --> 00:20:36.269
(intense music)

00:20:38.604 --> 00:20:41.441
(Negamon booming)

00:20:43.176 --> 00:20:44.577
Amazing!

00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:46.479
The ultimate miracle!

00:20:46.512 --> 00:20:48.347
The Celestial Knight!

00:20:49.649 --> 00:20:50.783

00:20:50.817 --> 00:20:53.920
(intense music)

00:20:53.953 --> 00:20:56.589
[Tai] Matt, did
you feel it, too?

00:20:56.622 --> 00:20:58.691
I did, I felt every one of them.

00:20:59.692 --> 00:21:02.328
Their hopes, prayers...

00:21:02.361 --> 00:21:04.330
We're not alone here.

00:21:04.363 --> 00:21:05.865
Their will is with us!

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:08.201
Tai,

00:21:08.968 --> 00:21:09.969
Matt,

00:21:10.636 --> 00:21:12.271
it's time.

00:21:12.305 --> 00:21:13.272
Let's go!

00:21:13.306 --> 00:21:14.273
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

00:21:14.307 --> 00:21:16.976
(intense music)

00:21:27.153 --> 00:21:29.789
We're putting an end to this.

00:21:29.822 --> 00:21:33.860
The great catastrophe
ends here and now!

00:21:33.893 --> 00:21:36.562
