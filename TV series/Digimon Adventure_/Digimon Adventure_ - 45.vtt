[Narrator] This is
the mysterious world

00:01:41.845 --> 00:01:45.148
where Digimon live
the digital world.

00:01:45.182 --> 00:01:47.184
Tai and the other Digi-destined,

00:01:47.217 --> 00:01:49.186
along with their
partner Digimon,

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:50.987
continue their quest.

00:01:51.021 --> 00:01:52.522
They are determined to prevent

00:01:52.556 --> 00:01:55.325
the impending resurrection
of Millenniumon,

00:01:55.358 --> 00:01:58.528
the bringer of
destruction and darkness.

00:01:58.562 --> 00:02:00.664
Through the battles
they had faced

00:02:00.697 --> 00:02:02.365
on the eternal continent,

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.835
Matt and Gabumon
began to show signs

00:02:04.868 --> 00:02:06.503
of an awesome new power.

00:02:06.536 --> 00:02:09.840
(energy trilling)

00:02:09.873 --> 00:02:11.374
(energy crackling)

00:02:11.408 --> 00:02:15.378
The true form of that power
is about to be revealed.

00:02:15.412 --> 00:02:18.048
(fan creaking)

00:02:19.416 --> 00:02:24.421
-(engine rumbling)

00:02:41.104 --> 00:02:43.240
-(Komondomon woofing)
-[Tai] Whoa, where are we?

00:02:43.273 --> 00:02:45.208
[Agumon] This place is huge!

00:02:45.242 --> 00:02:47.210
Looks like it's seen
better days though.

00:02:47.244 --> 00:02:49.412
I wonder if there are
any snacks around.

00:02:49.446 --> 00:02:51.248
-Huh? Ah?
-(engine revving)

00:02:51.281 --> 00:02:52.282
What is it, bud?

00:02:53.583 --> 00:02:55.752
Over there!

00:02:55.785 --> 00:02:58.255
[Sora] Whatever it is
it's moving really fast.

00:03:00.757 --> 00:03:02.058
[Izzy] Machmon, huh?

00:03:02.092 --> 00:03:03.894
I think I know where we are.

00:03:03.927 --> 00:03:06.129
We've arrived at some
sort of race track.

00:03:09.432 --> 00:03:10.400
(tires skidding)

00:03:10.433 --> 00:03:13.603
(engine sputtering)

00:03:13.637 --> 00:03:14.604
Hey Matt?

00:03:14.638 --> 00:03:16.239
Huh?

00:03:16.273 --> 00:03:17.941
How about we go for a run?

00:03:17.974 --> 00:03:21.278
(exciting orchestral music)

00:03:21.311 --> 00:03:22.279
(Digivice whirring)

00:03:22.312 --> 00:03:24.114
[Gabumon] Gabumon digivolve to

00:03:24.948 --> 00:03:25.949
Garurumon!

00:03:31.154 --> 00:03:32.789
(exciting suspenseful music)

00:03:32.822 --> 00:03:35.625
(engine revving)

00:03:40.497 --> 00:03:43.600
(tires screeching)

00:03:43.633 --> 00:03:45.769
(wind whooshing)

00:03:45.802 --> 00:03:47.437
Can I help you?

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:48.605
Nice speed!

00:03:48.638 --> 00:03:49.973
How's about a race?

00:03:50.974 --> 00:03:53.109
(scoffs) Got a name?

00:03:53.143 --> 00:03:54.311
Garurumon.

00:03:56.179 --> 00:03:58.481
You like to run, huh?

00:03:58.515 --> 00:04:01.651
Totally! Running with
Matt is always a blast.

00:04:01.685 --> 00:04:05.121
Matt? Oh, you must mean him.

00:04:05.155 --> 00:04:07.290
[Garurumon] Yeah,
he's my partner.

00:04:07.324 --> 00:04:08.959
As long as Matt's with me,

00:04:08.992 --> 00:04:13.129
I feel like I can go faster
than I can possibly imagine!

00:04:13.163 --> 00:04:14.464
Watching you twist and turn

00:04:14.497 --> 00:04:16.299
across the concrete just now,

00:04:16.333 --> 00:04:19.336
I felt this irresistible
urge to do the same thing.

00:04:19.369 --> 00:04:21.504
So what do you say, Machmon?

00:04:21.538 --> 00:04:22.539
You in?

00:04:23.506 --> 00:04:25.642
I'd stick to the
sidelines if I were you.

00:04:25.675 --> 00:04:26.810
(tires screeching)

00:04:26.843 --> 00:04:28.478
There isn't a soul alive

00:04:28.511 --> 00:04:30.647
that hasn't regretted
challenging me.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.016
(tires screeching)

00:04:33.049 --> 00:04:35.151
We'll see.

00:04:35.185 --> 00:04:38.822
(footsteps thudding)

00:04:38.855 --> 00:04:40.523
[Sora] What a cool box suite.

00:04:40.557 --> 00:04:43.026
We've got a perfect view
of the track from here.

00:04:43.059 --> 00:04:44.027
Wait a sec,

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.328
they're racing each other?

00:04:45.362 --> 00:04:47.530
It looks like they
already started!

00:04:48.698 --> 00:04:50.166
[Izzy] This circuit
is approximately

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.835
one and a half miles long.

00:04:51.868 --> 00:04:54.204
And it also features
three large banked turns.

00:04:54.237 --> 00:04:55.372
(tires skidding)

00:04:55.405 --> 00:04:56.373
(footsteps thumping)

00:04:56.406 --> 00:04:57.874
Ooh, I love that!

00:04:57.907 --> 00:04:59.509
What's a banked turn?

00:04:59.542 --> 00:05:00.710
[Izzy] It's a type of turn

00:05:00.744 --> 00:05:02.679
where the track is
sloped at an angle

00:05:02.712 --> 00:05:04.347
that makes the
outer side taller.

00:05:04.381 --> 00:05:06.016
This way racers can make a turn

00:05:06.049 --> 00:05:07.350
and maintain their momentum

00:05:07.384 --> 00:05:09.352
without having to slow down.

00:05:09.386 --> 00:05:10.854
There's an especially tricky one

00:05:10.887 --> 00:05:12.555
located right before the goal.

00:05:12.589 --> 00:05:14.724
The 450 degree looped curve

00:05:14.758 --> 00:05:17.060
is easily the most
challenging part.

00:05:17.093 --> 00:05:19.362
Yowza. Talk about extreme!

00:05:19.396 --> 00:05:21.398
(footsteps thudding)

00:05:21.431 --> 00:05:24.401
(engine thrumming)

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:31.207
-(Machmon exclaims)
-(energy whirring)

00:05:31.241 --> 00:05:33.209
[Matt] Nice, we
finally caught up!

00:05:33.243 --> 00:05:34.744
We got this in the bag.

00:05:36.112 --> 00:05:37.547
(Matt grunts)

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.383
(Machmon yells)

00:05:40.417 --> 00:05:41.918
I'm going to crush you!

00:05:41.951 --> 00:05:43.420
(exciting suspenseful music)

00:05:43.453 --> 00:05:45.588
-(Matt gasps)
-[Garurumon] Machmon?

00:05:45.622 --> 00:05:47.057
(tires screeching)

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:49.259
(weapons beeping)

00:05:49.292 --> 00:05:50.427
What's going on?

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.228
[Izzy] Machmon's
attacking Garurumon!

00:05:52.262 --> 00:05:53.229
But why?

00:05:53.263 --> 00:05:54.898
Geez, no need for violence.

00:05:54.931 --> 00:05:56.599
Except that's par for the course

00:05:56.633 --> 00:05:58.568
on the Digital World
Grand Prix Circuit.

00:05:58.601 --> 00:05:59.769
The grand what?

00:05:59.803 --> 00:06:01.771
[Gatomon] I had a feeling,

00:06:01.805 --> 00:06:03.940
we're at the Digital
World Grand Prix.

00:06:03.973 --> 00:06:05.408
Its origins are unclear,

00:06:05.442 --> 00:06:07.110
but it's a traditional event

00:06:07.143 --> 00:06:08.945
where contestants
gather and compete

00:06:08.978 --> 00:06:11.281
for the title of
the fastest Digimon.

00:06:11.314 --> 00:06:13.283
-(weapons beeping)
-(Machmon exclaiming)

00:06:13.316 --> 00:06:14.751
Participants are allowed to win

00:06:14.784 --> 00:06:16.286
using any means necessary,

00:06:16.319 --> 00:06:18.254
no matter how violent.

00:06:18.288 --> 00:06:19.489
It's a death race!

00:06:19.823 --> 00:06:22.092
C'mon, what's your
problem Machmon?

00:06:22.125 --> 00:06:24.461
Didn't think you were
the type to play dirty!

00:06:24.494 --> 00:06:25.762
(weapons beeping)

00:06:25.795 --> 00:06:29.432
-(electric crackling)
-Ah!

00:06:29.466 --> 00:06:31.468
(tires skidding)

00:06:31.501 --> 00:06:32.769
Hey, wait up!

00:06:32.802 --> 00:06:35.772
Slow down and tell us
what's going on here.

00:06:35.805 --> 00:06:37.974
(footsteps thudding)

00:06:38.007 --> 00:06:39.275
(echoing ring)

00:06:39.309 --> 00:06:41.811
-(Garurumon exclaiming)
-(metal swishing)

00:06:41.845 --> 00:06:44.114
(Garurumon grunting)

00:06:44.147 --> 00:06:45.281
(energy pulsing)

00:06:45.315 --> 00:06:46.483
Stop it.

00:06:46.516 --> 00:06:49.486
-That's enough!
-(metal clacking)

00:06:49.519 --> 00:06:51.488
(tires screeching)

00:06:51.521 --> 00:06:53.990
(metallic ringing)

00:06:54.023 --> 00:06:55.792
[Both] He's flying!

00:06:55.825 --> 00:06:58.294
(metal crashing)

00:06:58.328 --> 00:07:00.330
(Machmon exclaiming)

00:07:00.363 --> 00:07:01.498
Oh no!

00:07:01.531 --> 00:07:02.499
Matt!

00:07:02.532 --> 00:07:03.633
(Digivice trilling)

00:07:03.666 --> 00:07:05.802
Now Garurumon!

00:07:05.835 --> 00:07:07.670
(energy bursting)

00:07:07.704 --> 00:07:11.641
(exciting suspenseful
music fades)

00:07:11.674 --> 00:07:12.842
Garurumon.

00:07:13.877 --> 00:07:16.679
(loud crashing)

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.650
(Matt grunts)

00:07:20.683 --> 00:07:22.485
Are you okay?

00:07:22.519 --> 00:07:23.686
Come on buddy.

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:24.854
Speak to me!

00:07:24.888 --> 00:07:26.856
How is Machmon?

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:28.324
You gotta stay with me, okay?

00:07:28.358 --> 00:07:29.359
Gabumon!

00:07:32.695 --> 00:07:35.198
(fan creaking)

00:07:36.032 --> 00:07:37.200
(Gabumon grunting)

00:07:37.233 --> 00:07:39.335
[Matt] Gabumon?

00:07:39.369 --> 00:07:41.171
How are you feeling?

00:07:41.204 --> 00:07:42.172
[Gabumon] Better.

00:07:42.205 --> 00:07:43.173
That's good to hear!

00:07:43.206 --> 00:07:45.008
You're not still
hurting, are you?

00:07:45.041 --> 00:07:46.009
[Gabumon] Nah.

00:07:46.042 --> 00:07:47.877
I think I'm fine thanks.

00:07:47.911 --> 00:07:49.179
(engine rumbling)

00:07:49.212 --> 00:07:50.680
Sorry about what
happened back there.

00:07:50.713 --> 00:07:51.848
[Gabumon] Oh uh.

00:07:51.881 --> 00:07:53.516
Machmon's the one
who carried you here.

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:55.185
Really?

00:07:55.218 --> 00:07:57.020
It was the least I could do

00:07:57.053 --> 00:07:58.354
But why did you?

00:07:58.388 --> 00:07:59.856
[Patamon] Whoa!
These are so cool!

00:07:59.889 --> 00:08:00.957
(trophies twinkling)

00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:02.559
[Gatomon] Trophies and
plaques from the Grand Prix.

00:08:02.592 --> 00:08:04.561
Seems like Machmon has
won a lot of races.

00:08:04.594 --> 00:08:06.062
[Palmon] Wow, impressive!

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:10.233
I'm afraid that's
all in the past.

00:08:10.266 --> 00:08:11.701
You see,

00:08:11.734 --> 00:08:13.570
I've actually been
burning rubber alone

00:08:13.603 --> 00:08:15.205
for quite some time now.

00:08:15.238 --> 00:08:16.439
-(gentle melancholic music)
-[Sora] What?

00:08:17.407 --> 00:08:19.909
You mean they put the
breaks on the grand Prix?

00:08:20.743 --> 00:08:22.879
Yep. It is what it is kid.

00:08:22.912 --> 00:08:25.215
(Gabumon sighs)

00:08:25.248 --> 00:08:27.250
Your glory days
may be long gone,

00:08:27.283 --> 00:08:29.552
but that's no excuse for
attacking a fellow Digimon

00:08:29.586 --> 00:08:32.388
who didn't even know
about the old death races.

00:08:32.422 --> 00:08:33.590
When I'm in the zone,

00:08:33.623 --> 00:08:36.593
my instincts kick in
like a burst of nitro.

00:08:36.626 --> 00:08:38.928
Once it's on, I can't hold back.

00:08:38.962 --> 00:08:40.063
Oh, c'mon!

00:08:40.096 --> 00:08:41.431
You can outrun anyone!

00:08:41.464 --> 00:08:43.566
So why do you need to
resort to foul play?

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:46.102
Matches are a different story.

00:08:46.135 --> 00:08:47.570
You can't protect your title

00:08:47.604 --> 00:08:49.572
by playing fair, unfortunately.

00:08:49.606 --> 00:08:52.575
But you don't need to care
about that kinda stuff now.

00:08:52.609 --> 00:08:54.577
You're still out there
doing laps by yourself

00:08:54.611 --> 00:08:56.913
because you just
like to race, right?

00:08:56.946 --> 00:08:59.949
As long as there's
competition, I have to win.

00:08:59.983 --> 00:09:04.120
If I give up on that,
I give up on myself.

00:09:04.153 --> 00:09:06.422
Listen, every time
you revved up,

00:09:06.456 --> 00:09:09.092
it's like I could
hear your soul sing.

00:09:09.125 --> 00:09:11.294
Which is why I wanna
rematch with you!

00:09:11.327 --> 00:09:12.462
(Machmon gasps)

00:09:12.495 --> 00:09:13.463
Gabumon?

00:09:13.496 --> 00:09:15.431
I'm asking you to
try and beat me

00:09:15.465 --> 00:09:17.467
based on speed and speed alone!

00:09:18.801 --> 00:09:20.637
And I know you
have what it takes,

00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:23.273
'cause I've seen
how fast you can go.

00:09:23.306 --> 00:09:25.141
What are you getting at?

00:09:25.174 --> 00:09:26.943
Whenever I'm blazing
through the trails

00:09:26.976 --> 00:09:29.279
with Matt on my back, it's
the best feeling in the world!

00:09:29.312 --> 00:09:32.282
It's like the two of us
are one with each other.

00:09:32.315 --> 00:09:34.150
And that's what
gives me my legs.

00:09:34.183 --> 00:09:36.286
Look, you might
not have a partner,

00:09:36.319 --> 00:09:37.820
but you do have a pal.

00:09:37.854 --> 00:09:40.790
Who's willing to give you a
little friendly competition.

00:09:40.823 --> 00:09:41.958
(Machmon grunts)

00:09:41.991 --> 00:09:43.626
If we can have a fair race,

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:45.962
then it'll be the most
epic Grand Prix ever!

00:09:45.995 --> 00:09:48.498
(gentle melancholic music fades)

00:09:48.531 --> 00:09:49.499
You got a deal.

00:09:49.532 --> 00:09:50.967
Yes!

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.003
But absolutely no
battling, just racing.

00:09:54.103 --> 00:09:55.038
Of course!

00:09:55.505 --> 00:09:56.973
As long as it's a clean race,

00:09:57.006 --> 00:09:58.808
we'll be cheering you
on from the sidelines!

00:09:58.841 --> 00:10:01.511
So that means you two
better bring on the heat!

00:10:01.544 --> 00:10:04.847
-You know it!
-(Matt grunts)

00:10:04.881 --> 00:10:07.684
(wind whistling)

00:10:09.719 --> 00:10:12.188
You seem concerned Matt,
is something the matter?

00:10:12.221 --> 00:10:15.191
You worried Machmon's not
gonna follow through with this?

00:10:16.859 --> 00:10:18.328
I'm thinking about
the sudden shift

00:10:18.361 --> 00:10:19.996
that happened during the race.

00:10:20.029 --> 00:10:21.364
We're supposed to
believe that was

00:10:21.397 --> 00:10:23.833
just Machmon's
instincts kicking in.

00:10:23.866 --> 00:10:26.169
But there's
something more to it,

00:10:26.202 --> 00:10:27.370
I just don't know what.

00:10:28.371 --> 00:10:31.207
I guess we'll have to find the
answer out on the racetrack.

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:33.710
The deciding factor
will probably be

00:10:33.743 --> 00:10:36.254
-this 450 degree loop.
-(soft ominous droning)

00:10:41.167 --> 00:10:43.836
(logo whooshing)

00:10:44.971 --> 00:10:46.973
(spirited ceremonious music)

00:10:47.006 --> 00:10:48.608
[Joe] Here we are, folks!

00:10:48.641 --> 00:10:50.810
Get ready for the
match of the century!

00:10:50.843 --> 00:10:52.312
I'm your host, Joe Kido!

00:10:52.345 --> 00:10:54.647
With the great Izzy Izumi
providing commentary!

00:10:54.681 --> 00:10:55.982
Go on.

00:10:56.015 --> 00:10:57.617
Garurumon's a newcomer,

00:10:57.650 --> 00:10:59.619
so we'll have to see
if he has what it takes

00:10:59.652 --> 00:11:01.287
to overthrow the champion.

00:11:01.321 --> 00:11:02.455
Is what Izzy would say

00:11:02.488 --> 00:11:04.791
Wait a sec, where'd Izzy go?

00:11:04.824 --> 00:11:06.793
[Group] Hey, Hey! Ho, ho!

00:11:06.826 --> 00:11:09.629
Garurumon is ready to go!

00:11:09.662 --> 00:11:11.831
[Group] Hey, hey! Ho, ho!

00:11:11.864 --> 00:11:14.000
We be fast and they be slow!

00:11:14.033 --> 00:11:15.501
Not that I disagree,

00:11:15.535 --> 00:11:17.971
but why do I have to do this?

00:11:18.004 --> 00:11:20.173
[Joe] The rules are simple
and straightforward.

00:11:20.206 --> 00:11:21.474
The first one to finish

00:11:21.507 --> 00:11:22.842
three complete laps
around the course

00:11:22.875 --> 00:11:25.178
and reach the goal
is the winner!

00:11:25.211 --> 00:11:29.015
It's Garurumon versus Machman!
Who shall seize victory?

00:11:29.716 --> 00:11:32.518
Let me thank you
while I still can.

00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:36.856
I never thought I'd get the
chance to race someone again.

00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:40.493
I'm making this last one count.

00:11:40.526 --> 00:11:41.995
Your last one?

00:11:42.028 --> 00:11:44.864
Don't get too close
to me once we start.

00:11:44.897 --> 00:11:47.000
If I spin out and
lose control again,

00:11:47.033 --> 00:11:49.035
it's gonna be a real drag.

00:11:49.068 --> 00:11:50.670
[Tai] I hope you're ready!

00:11:50.703 --> 00:11:52.538
The countdown is starting now!

00:11:52.572 --> 00:11:55.375
Nine, eight, seven,

00:11:55.408 --> 00:11:58.678
-six, five, four,
-(Machmon revving)

00:11:58.711 --> 00:12:01.714
[Tai] three, two, one!

00:12:01.748 --> 00:12:03.182
Start the race!

00:12:03.216 --> 00:12:04.684
(Komondomon howls)

00:12:04.717 --> 00:12:06.352
(spirited orchestral music)

00:12:06.386 --> 00:12:07.520
[Joe] And we're off!

00:12:07.553 --> 00:12:09.722
-Go you two!
-Do your best, guys!

00:12:09.756 --> 00:12:13.359
-(engine thrumming)
-(footsteps thumping)

00:12:13.393 --> 00:12:14.360
Whoa!

00:12:14.394 --> 00:12:16.029
My eyes can't keep up.

00:12:16.062 --> 00:12:17.730
[Joe] They've rounded
the first corner

00:12:17.764 --> 00:12:19.399
and Machmon's taken the lead.

00:12:19.432 --> 00:12:22.402
But Garurumon's
closing in from behind!

00:12:22.435 --> 00:12:24.070
It's anyone's guess
how the situation

00:12:24.103 --> 00:12:25.371
might unfold from here.

00:12:25.405 --> 00:12:26.539
Right Tentomon?

00:12:26.572 --> 00:12:28.207
-Wait, what?
-Izzy just called him over,

00:12:28.241 --> 00:12:29.876
so I think he had to leave.

00:12:29.909 --> 00:12:31.377
[Joe] Seriously?

00:12:31.411 --> 00:12:36.416
-(footsteps thumping)
-(engine thrumming)

00:12:39.285 --> 00:12:41.587
You alright with leaving
the planning up to me?

00:12:41.621 --> 00:12:42.588
Of course!

00:12:42.622 --> 00:12:43.890
Long as you're alright

00:12:43.923 --> 00:12:45.425
with letting me do the running.

00:12:47.126 --> 00:12:49.395
We'll stay quiet
for the first lap,

00:12:49.429 --> 00:12:51.431
so we can check how
our opponent moves.

00:12:51.464 --> 00:12:53.099
Copy.

00:12:53.132 --> 00:12:58.137
-(engine thrumming)
-(footsteps thumping)

00:13:00.606 --> 00:13:03.242
[Garurumon] These turns
are kind of intense!

00:13:03.276 --> 00:13:06.612
(electricity crackling)

00:13:06.646 --> 00:13:09.082
(computer trilling)

00:13:09.115 --> 00:13:11.451
I haven't seen any
noticeable changes yet

00:13:11.484 --> 00:13:14.287
(engine revving)

00:13:17.323 --> 00:13:18.758
They're unreal!

00:13:18.791 --> 00:13:20.927
It's so windy here.

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:22.128
[Joe] Here we go!

00:13:22.161 --> 00:13:23.930
They both begun
their second laps!

00:13:23.963 --> 00:13:25.431
They're catching up.

00:13:25.465 --> 00:13:26.766
-(energy trilling)
-(footsteps thumping)

00:13:26.799 --> 00:13:28.101
Time to move in.

00:13:28.134 --> 00:13:29.669
Roger that.

00:13:33.639 --> 00:13:35.108
(tires skidding)

00:13:35.141 --> 00:13:36.109
Here we go.

00:13:36.142 --> 00:13:37.443
(energy crackling)

00:13:37.477 --> 00:13:40.780
-(computer trilling)
-Huh?

00:13:40.813 --> 00:13:41.981
[Izzy] Matt!

00:13:42.014 --> 00:13:43.950
-(weapons beeping)
-(Machmon exclaiming)

00:13:43.983 --> 00:13:44.984
(Garurumon grunts)

00:13:45.017 --> 00:13:46.119
(group gasping)

00:13:46.152 --> 00:13:47.453
Not again!

00:13:47.487 --> 00:13:48.988
What gives? That's
against the rules!

00:13:49.021 --> 00:13:49.989
We went over this.

00:13:50.022 --> 00:13:52.158
You were not supposed to attack.

00:13:52.191 --> 00:13:54.127
(Machmon yelling)

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:55.962
(energy crackling)

00:13:55.995 --> 00:13:57.130
Watch out!

00:13:57.163 --> 00:13:58.164
You need to Dodge!

00:13:58.197 --> 00:13:59.165
(Garurumon gasping)

00:13:59.198 --> 00:14:00.466
What's happening?

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:02.301
[Izzy] Listen, something
tells me that Machmon

00:14:02.335 --> 00:14:04.837
might be attacking
you against his will.

00:14:04.871 --> 00:14:07.306
Look! I detected some
anomalous vital signs,

00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:08.641
deep within Machmon's body.

00:14:08.674 --> 00:14:10.309
-(tense orchestral music)
-[Tai] What is this?

00:14:10.343 --> 00:14:12.345
[Izzy] A Digimon that
leeches off other Digimon,

00:14:12.378 --> 00:14:13.646
Parasimon!

00:14:13.679 --> 00:14:15.314
That's horrible!

00:14:15.348 --> 00:14:17.984
[Gatomon] The Parasimon
help a host Digimon

00:14:18.017 --> 00:14:20.820
maximize their abilities in
exchange for their energy.

00:14:20.853 --> 00:14:23.489
It seems like a
symbiotic relationship,

00:14:23.523 --> 00:14:25.324
but there's more
to it than that.

00:14:25.358 --> 00:14:27.493
The host's body and mind

00:14:27.527 --> 00:14:29.028
become more infested over time

00:14:29.061 --> 00:14:31.531
until the Parasimon take
them over completely.

00:14:31.564 --> 00:14:34.000
Hosts becomea living shell.

00:14:34.033 --> 00:14:36.335
[Tai] No way! How do
we purge them out?

00:14:36.369 --> 00:14:37.837
I'm not entirely sure.

00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:41.040
At this point they could be
completely fused together.

00:14:41.073 --> 00:14:42.341
[Matt] Hold on.

00:14:42.375 --> 00:14:44.043
I think Machmon's
been fighting it.

00:14:44.076 --> 00:14:46.846
He hasn't allowed himself
to be taken over yet.

00:14:46.879 --> 00:14:48.047
(Machmon groaning)

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:49.348
[Izzy] Glad to hear it.

00:14:49.382 --> 00:14:51.684
I try to pinpoint the
Parasimon's whereabouts.

00:14:51.717 --> 00:14:55.221
(energy whirring)

00:14:55.254 --> 00:14:58.090
(Machmon yelling)

00:15:00.059 --> 00:15:03.062
(gasps) Machmon, no!

00:15:03.095 --> 00:15:04.363
(tires screeching)

00:15:04.397 --> 00:15:06.199
[Garurumon] Is your
body getting hijacked?

00:15:06.232 --> 00:15:08.901
[Machmon] Yes. And I wouldn't
have it any other way.

00:15:08.935 --> 00:15:11.237
You're joking, right? Why?

00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:14.373
-(metallic clacking)
-(Machmon exclaiming)

00:15:14.407 --> 00:15:16.876
Please! Tell us what's going on.

00:15:16.909 --> 00:15:20.880
I have to unleash my maximum
speed and keep my title.

00:15:20.913 --> 00:15:23.716
That's why I let Parasimon in!

00:15:23.749 --> 00:15:25.718
You're not the only
one with a partner.

00:15:25.751 --> 00:15:28.087
We're the exact opposite of you.

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:29.889
You guys are a team,

00:15:29.922 --> 00:15:31.924
I'm just a phony champion!

00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:34.093
That's not true!

00:15:34.126 --> 00:15:35.595
Get out of here!

00:15:35.628 --> 00:15:39.065
I can't stop my body from
attacking you Garurumon!

00:15:39.098 --> 00:15:42.101
No way! This race is
between you and me!

00:15:42.134 --> 00:15:43.903
[Machmon] Once I fall apart,

00:15:43.936 --> 00:15:47.106
this free loader will find
some new host to take over.

00:15:47.139 --> 00:15:49.242
But I won't let that happen!

00:15:49.275 --> 00:15:51.744
I'm gonna burn out
and blow myself up

00:15:51.777 --> 00:15:53.913
to get rid of
Parasimon for good!

00:15:53.946 --> 00:15:55.081
(Garurumon gasps)

00:15:55.114 --> 00:15:56.782
You planned on this
from the start?

00:15:57.984 --> 00:16:00.786
I played the fake champion
and lost my friends.

00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:04.924
The only part of me left is
this miserable loneliness.

00:16:04.957 --> 00:16:06.592
I can't take it anymore!

00:16:06.626 --> 00:16:10.429
-I'm done running in circles!
-(energy whirring)

00:16:10.463 --> 00:16:12.932
I'm gonna tear you into pieces!

00:16:12.965 --> 00:16:14.133
(metallic clacking)

00:16:14.166 --> 00:16:15.968
Nothing left to
do but fight back.

00:16:17.136 --> 00:16:20.306
(low growl) Then let's go.

00:16:20.339 --> 00:16:22.775
(suspenseful orchestral music)

00:16:22.808 --> 00:16:24.810
Garurumon Digivolve to

00:16:25.845 --> 00:16:28.681
(energy whirring)

00:16:31.684 --> 00:16:34.520
(energy trilling)

00:16:35.488 --> 00:16:36.656
WereGarurumon!

00:16:39.992 --> 00:16:43.629
(energy trilling)

00:16:43.663 --> 00:16:46.332
(energy ringing)

00:16:48.367 --> 00:16:50.469
-(teeth gnashing)
-(WereGarurumon grunting)

00:16:50.503 --> 00:16:52.638
(metallic clacking)

00:16:52.672 --> 00:16:54.340
(electricity crackling)

00:16:54.373 --> 00:16:55.641
[Izzy] I found something!

00:16:55.675 --> 00:16:57.810
I did a quick scan when
those legs regenerated.

00:16:57.843 --> 00:17:00.813
There was a huge energy
spike in the engine's core!

00:17:00.846 --> 00:17:03.316
I bet that's where
Parasimon's hiding.

00:17:03.349 --> 00:17:05.484
-Take 'em out while we can!
-(Digivice trilling)

00:17:05.518 --> 00:17:08.688
-(energy bursting)
-Sounds good to me!

00:17:08.721 --> 00:17:11.557
(energy whirring)

00:17:13.025 --> 00:17:16.654
(Matt yelling)

00:17:20.074 --> 00:17:22.827
(Parasimon warbling)

00:17:25.129 --> 00:17:27.932
(Matt grunting)

00:17:27.965 --> 00:17:28.966
Matt, no!

00:17:30.301 --> 00:17:32.603
Leave them be Parasimon!

00:17:32.636 --> 00:17:34.305
They've got nothing
to do with me!

00:17:34.338 --> 00:17:35.940
[WereGarurumon] Says who?

00:17:35.973 --> 00:17:37.775
Are you really
gonna cut us loose

00:17:37.808 --> 00:17:39.477
after we've been through?

00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:41.278
-(energy crackling)
-What are you talking about?

00:17:41.312 --> 00:17:43.314
Hurry up and get outta here!

00:17:43.347 --> 00:17:46.117
Don't worry about
me I'll be fine.

00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:48.786
Just leave me alone!

00:17:48.819 --> 00:17:49.954
No, can do.

00:17:49.987 --> 00:17:52.289
It's like my partner
was trying to tell you,

00:17:52.323 --> 00:17:54.458
you can't go back
once you run together.

00:17:54.492 --> 00:17:57.461
'Cause now we're friends!

00:17:57.495 --> 00:17:58.796
You hear that!

00:17:58.829 --> 00:18:01.665
You can't get rid of
us that easy, buddy.

00:18:03.167 --> 00:18:04.335
I promise!

00:18:04.368 --> 00:18:06.804
Me and Matt are gonna
put an end to this.

00:18:06.837 --> 00:18:09.473
No more chasing pavement
from here on out!

00:18:09.507 --> 00:18:12.843
-(energy whirring)
-(Digivice whirring)

00:18:12.877 --> 00:18:15.646
(exciting rhythmic music)

00:18:15.679 --> 00:18:19.016
(WereGarurumon yelling)

00:18:20.351 --> 00:18:21.485
[Matt] That's right.

00:18:21.519 --> 00:18:23.154
There's always tomorrow.

00:18:23.187 --> 00:18:24.688
Even when you're
past haunts you,

00:18:24.722 --> 00:18:26.323
you can still move forward.

00:18:26.357 --> 00:18:28.059
No time like the present to try.

00:18:29.026 --> 00:18:30.861
Stand up, face front.

00:18:30.895 --> 00:18:32.329
Take a real deep breath,

00:18:32.363 --> 00:18:34.698
and live your life
to the fullest!

00:18:38.235 --> 00:18:39.336
[Both] Keep fighting!

00:18:39.370 --> 00:18:40.871
Never give up!

00:18:40.905 --> 00:18:43.908
(Digivice whirring)

00:18:47.878 --> 00:18:51.348
(energy trilling)

00:18:51.382 --> 00:18:52.716
WereGarurumon!

00:18:54.051 --> 00:18:55.052
Digivolve to

00:18:56.387 --> 00:18:59.223
(energy whizzing)

00:19:01.559 --> 00:19:04.061

(Gomamon exclaiming)

00:19:20.945 --> 00:19:23.047
That's incredible,
A Mega Digimon!

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:24.248
(group gasping)

00:19:24.281 --> 00:19:25.883
No way! He just digivolved!

00:19:25.916 --> 00:19:28.886
(air whoosing)

00:19:28.919 --> 00:19:31.922
(metallic clacking)

00:19:35.926 --> 00:19:38.762
(metal clashing)

00:19:38.796 --> 00:19:42.266
(air whooshing)

-(metallic clinking)
-Metal Wolf Claw!

00:19:51.775 --> 00:19:54.445
(air whooshing)

00:19:57.948 --> 00:20:00.084

(metal clacking)

00:20:01.952 --> 00:20:04.088
Machmon! You're gonna be okay!

00:20:04.121 --> 00:20:05.789
(electricity crackling)

00:20:05.823 --> 00:20:07.925
Hey, uh, you can slow down now!

00:20:07.958 --> 00:20:09.460
Are you listening?

00:20:11.629 --> 00:20:12.596
[Izzy] At this velocity,

00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:14.632
he's going right
out of the loop!

00:20:14.665 --> 00:20:16.800
And the only thing
past that cliff is air!

00:20:16.834 --> 00:20:19.603
We have to do something!

00:20:19.637 --> 00:20:21.605
Leave it to me, Matt!

00:20:21.639 --> 00:20:23.774
-Garuru Tomahawk!

(metal crashing)

00:20:34.018 --> 00:20:35.486
Could be worse.

00:20:35.519 --> 00:20:36.954
Oh, well.

00:20:36.987 --> 00:20:39.657
Time to cross that great
finish line in the sky.

00:20:39.690 --> 00:20:41.158
[MetalGarurumon] Not so fast!

00:20:41.192 --> 00:20:42.626
(Machmon gasps)

00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:45.829

-(gentle heartfelt music)
-Check you out,

00:21:03.514 --> 00:21:04.982
You're still in one piece!

00:21:05.015 --> 00:21:07.351
You should be able to run
without any problems now.

00:21:07.384 --> 00:21:08.385
Okay, buddy?

00:21:09.386 --> 00:21:10.988
Better get moving.

00:21:11.021 --> 00:21:12.890
Don't you know the
goals just up ahead?

00:21:15.059 --> 00:21:16.060

-MetalGarurumon.

This Digimon digivolves
from WereGarurumon.

Metal Garurumon is
covered in metal

from head to toe in this form!

00:22:52.823 --> 00:22:54.925
[Gabumon] Let's check
out more facts about me.

-[Izzy] Hey Gabumon!
-(gentle inspirational music)

00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:57.628
[Gabumon] I may have
a steely physique,

00:22:57.661 --> 00:22:59.763
but my jaws are not metalized.

00:22:59.797 --> 00:23:01.632
And whenever Matt
scratches me there,

00:23:01.665 --> 00:23:03.634
it's the best
feeling in the world.

00:23:03.667 --> 00:23:05.636
[Izzy] Really? I
wanna pet you too!

00:23:05.669 --> 00:23:07.137
