(instrumental piano)

00:00:02.243 --> 00:00:03.278
(wind swooshes)

00:00:03.311 --> 00:00:04.445
(sword scrapes)

00:00:04.479 --> 00:00:07.548

00:00:11.152 --> 00:00:13.321
[Izzy] Time for the
Digimon Encyclopedia!

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:16.291
Today, we're gonna
look at Gabumon.

00:00:16.324 --> 00:00:17.325
He's Matt's partner.

00:00:18.927 --> 00:00:21.296
His unique, long
horn is optimized

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:22.330
for close-range battles.

00:00:23.631 --> 00:00:24.933
Now, let's check this out!

00:00:25.934 --> 00:00:28.770
The fur coat that he's wearing
seems to be Garurumon's.

00:00:29.637 --> 00:00:32.307
What does the lining inside
that coat look like, I wonder?

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.276
Huh, maybe I'll get to
take a peek at it one day!

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.745
(triumphant music)

00:00:37.779 --> 00:00:40.014
Which Digimon will
it be next time?

00:00:42.116 --> 00:00:43.084

[Narrator] In order
to avenge Ogremon,

00:02:13.908 --> 00:02:16.577
and to make sure that their
friends stay protected,

00:02:16.611 --> 00:02:20.348
Tai and Greymon managed
to awaken a new power.

00:02:20.381 --> 00:02:23.251
They digivolved into
an Ultimate Digimon,

00:02:23.284 --> 00:02:24.519
MetalGreymon

00:02:24.552 --> 00:02:27.388
and defeated MetalTyrannomon

00:02:27.422 --> 00:02:29.757
(laser chirps)

00:02:29.791 --> 00:02:33.094
(MetalTyrannomon explodes)

00:02:33.127 --> 00:02:37.598
(adventurous instrumental music)

00:02:37.632 --> 00:02:39.267
However, they soon found

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.202
that the path they
were planning to take

00:02:41.235 --> 00:02:44.872
was blocked by a swamp
emitting dark miasma.

00:02:44.906 --> 00:02:48.276
The six Digidestined, who'd
finally been united,

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:50.645
were forced to split
up into two teams,

00:02:50.678 --> 00:02:54.415
and each set out in search
of the Celestial Digimon.

00:02:59.253 --> 00:03:00.354
[Mimi] Ugh

00:03:00.388 --> 00:03:03.091
Who even suggested drawing
names in the first place?!

00:03:03.124 --> 00:03:05.226
[Palmon] That
would be you, Mimi.

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:07.929
[Mimi] Plus, it's
seriously cold out here!

00:03:07.962 --> 00:03:09.797
And double plus, just look!

00:03:09.831 --> 00:03:10.798
[Palmon And Mimi] Huh?

00:03:10.832 --> 00:03:11.799
(Tai and Agumon grunting)

00:03:11.833 --> 00:03:13.968
[Mimi] I can't climb
like those guys can!

00:03:14.001 --> 00:03:15.970
(Tai gasps)

00:03:16.003 --> 00:03:16.971
Mimi, come on!

00:03:17.004 --> 00:03:18.806
Hurry up and join us!

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.007
Ugh, no way!

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:23.077
You have to do something Palmon.

00:03:23.111 --> 00:03:24.078
What can I do?

00:03:24.112 --> 00:03:25.279
We already picked our route.

00:03:25.313 --> 00:03:26.914
I can't just unpick it now.

00:03:26.948 --> 00:03:28.583
[Tentomon] See ya
when we get there!

00:03:28.616 --> 00:03:29.584
(Mimi groans)

00:03:29.617 --> 00:03:30.818
No fair!

00:03:30.852 --> 00:03:34.088
Hey, I thought this was
suppose to be a detour!

00:03:34.122 --> 00:03:35.990
Well its not exactly a detour.

00:03:36.457 --> 00:03:38.459
[Tai] If we're going
around the North side

00:03:38.493 --> 00:03:40.428
to make sure we avoid
that dangerous swamp,

00:03:40.461 --> 00:03:43.264
then the fastest route is
to go straight through here.

00:03:43.297 --> 00:03:46.334
So hurry up, the Celestial
Digimon is waiting!

00:03:46.367 --> 00:03:48.302
[Palmon] C'mon, Mimi, let's go.

00:03:48.336 --> 00:03:50.438
Huh? Huh? Huh?!

00:03:50.471 --> 00:03:51.772
Is this easier?

00:03:51.806 --> 00:03:52.773
Uh-huh!

00:03:52.807 --> 00:03:54.442
Palmon, you're the best!

00:03:54.475 --> 00:03:56.010
I love you!

00:03:56.043 --> 00:03:58.513
(wind roaring)

00:03:58.546 --> 00:04:00.648
Whoa! This is amazing!

00:04:01.983 --> 00:04:04.318
I have a suspicion that
we just might be able

00:04:04.352 --> 00:04:06.454
to acquire some new
information here!

00:04:06.487 --> 00:04:08.189
You know, I wonder,

00:04:08.222 --> 00:04:10.525
what does this place
look like inside?

00:04:10.558 --> 00:04:13.494
(creature humming)

00:04:16.831 --> 00:04:18.299
Hmm.

00:04:18.332 --> 00:04:21.369
(wind whooshing)

00:04:21.402 --> 00:04:23.804
Boy, I'm so glad we got
to go with Birdramon

00:04:23.838 --> 00:04:26.507
Keep it up, Birdramon!
We've gotta hurry!

00:04:26.541 --> 00:04:27.642
Leave it to me!

00:04:27.675 --> 00:04:29.644
(wind whooshing intensely)

00:04:29.677 --> 00:04:31.512
(unknown entity shines)

00:04:31.546 --> 00:04:32.513
Huh?

00:04:32.547 --> 00:04:34.348
Something's coming!

00:04:34.382 --> 00:04:36.384
(wings buzzing)

00:04:36.417 --> 00:04:38.653
(Sandyanmamon screeches)

00:04:38.686 --> 00:04:40.388
(tornadoes forms)

00:04:40.421 --> 00:04:43.057
(Joe yelling)

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:44.559
What's going on?!

00:04:44.592 --> 00:04:46.194
Dust devils! Hang on!

00:04:46.227 --> 00:04:47.228
We'll cut through them!

00:04:47.261 --> 00:04:48.229
(Sandyanmamon screeches)

00:04:48.262 --> 00:04:51.065
(wind blows intensely)

00:04:51.098 --> 00:04:53.034
We're gonna get caught in them!

00:04:53.067 --> 00:04:55.069
We need to land! Now!

00:04:55.102 --> 00:04:59.340
(intense instrumental music)

00:04:59.373 --> 00:05:01.876
(Birdramon thudding)

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:03.177
(wings flapping)

00:05:03.211 --> 00:05:04.679
Gabumon, here they come!

00:05:04.712 --> 00:05:05.680
[Gabumon] Yeah!

00:05:05.713 --> 00:05:08.749
(wings buzzing)

00:05:08.783 --> 00:05:12.019
(ground rumbles)

00:05:12.053 --> 00:05:13.854
(metal scrapes)

00:05:13.888 --> 00:05:16.857
(creatures thud)

00:05:16.891 --> 00:05:18.259
(Sandyanmamon screeching)

00:05:18.292 --> 00:05:19.594
(wind chimes)

00:05:19.627 --> 00:05:22.430
(ground rumbles)

00:05:27.068 --> 00:05:28.035
(Digimon whimpering)

00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:29.937
What is going on?!

00:05:29.971 --> 00:05:32.039
Was that an ally?

00:05:32.073 --> 00:05:33.441
-(ground explodes)
-(Joe and Gomamon yelling)

00:05:33.474 --> 00:05:34.609
It's coming back!

00:05:34.642 --> 00:05:36.377
(Kyaromon chirping)

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:39.880
-Aw, they're just Kyaromon!
-(Kyaromon gasping)

00:05:39.914 --> 00:05:42.617
(ground rumbles)

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:44.752
No, please don't hurt me!

00:05:44.785 --> 00:05:46.754
(Kyaromon chirping)

00:05:46.787 --> 00:05:49.290
(Kyaromon smacks tail)

00:05:49.323 --> 00:05:52.293
(Sandyamamon squelches)

(wind chimes)

(Kyaromon squeaks)

00:05:54.929 --> 00:05:58.799
-(claw clanking)
-(Kyaromon squeaks)

00:05:58.833 --> 00:05:59.800
Biyomon, quick!

00:05:59.834 --> 00:06:00.801
Right!

00:06:00.835 --> 00:06:01.802
-(rock music begins)
-Gomamon!

00:06:01.836 --> 00:06:02.803
Let's go, too!

00:06:02.837 --> 00:06:03.804
You got it!

00:06:03.838 --> 00:06:05.273
Spiral Twister!

00:06:06.841 --> 00:06:08.342
Marching Fishes!

00:06:09.277 --> 00:06:11.946
(attacks thuds)

00:06:13.281 --> 00:06:16.083
(gadget whirs)

00:06:16.117 --> 00:06:19.320
(rock music continues)

00:06:20.321 --> 00:06:25.326
(singing in Japanese)

00:06:30.131 --> 00:06:32.833
Gabumon digivolve to...

00:06:32.867 --> 00:06:36.137
(rock music continues)

00:06:48.149 --> 00:06:49.150
Garurumon!

00:06:51.352 --> 00:06:52.520
(Garurumon growls)

00:06:52.553 --> 00:06:54.789
(Kyaromon screeches)

00:06:54.822 --> 00:06:55.823
Kyaromon!

00:06:57.158 --> 00:06:58.125
Don't worry.

00:06:58.159 --> 00:06:59.160
You're safe now.

00:07:00.027 --> 00:07:02.997
(Garurumon snarls)

00:07:04.832 --> 00:07:07.735
(Garurumon growls)

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:11.138
This guy's reading our moves,

00:07:11.172 --> 00:07:13.874
by sensing the vibrations
we make through the sand!

00:07:13.908 --> 00:07:16.177
Garurumon! Attack
the base of the claw!

00:07:17.578 --> 00:07:18.846
(Garurumon belches)

00:07:18.879 --> 00:07:20.648

(Garurumon growls)

00:07:22.249 --> 00:07:23.317
You guys, go on!

00:07:23.351 --> 00:07:24.352
Yeah okay.

00:07:26.587 --> 00:07:29.357
(ground beeping)

00:07:30.858 --> 00:07:32.193
(tail scrapes)

00:07:32.226 --> 00:07:33.694
Garurumon!

00:07:33.728 --> 00:07:34.729
Yeah!

00:07:37.732 --> 00:07:41.402

-(steps crunching)
-(Gabumon sighs)

00:07:47.541 --> 00:07:49.744
Did you get hurt during
that fight, Gabumon?

00:07:49.777 --> 00:07:51.345
No, I'm fine.

00:07:51.379 --> 00:07:52.380
But still,

00:08:00.287 --> 00:08:01.422
That power...

00:08:01.455 --> 00:08:03.624
It could be an Ultimate Digimon.

00:08:04.592 --> 00:08:05.593
Over here!

00:08:08.129 --> 00:08:10.231
(water running)

00:08:14.435 --> 00:08:15.469
[Neemon] Ohhh.

00:08:15.503 --> 00:08:17.405
So, you're humans, are you?

00:08:17.438 --> 00:08:19.573
I've never seen one before!

00:08:19.607 --> 00:08:21.108
Now, don't be worried.

00:08:21.142 --> 00:08:23.911
These guys are the ones who
saved Kyaromon, after all.

00:08:23.944 --> 00:08:25.446
(Kyaromon chirps)

00:08:25.479 --> 00:08:27.081
Let me introduce myself.

00:08:27.114 --> 00:08:28.449
I'm Neemon.

00:08:28.482 --> 00:08:29.917
You know, I'm pretty impressed

00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:32.486
that you were able
to escape Scorpiomon.

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:34.121
Scorpiomon, huh?

00:08:34.155 --> 00:08:36.157
That's the giant
Digimon from earlier?

00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:40.127
This whole area has become
Scorpiomon's territory.

00:08:40.161 --> 00:08:43.631
You saw the SandYanmamon that
made those dust devils, right?

00:08:44.965 --> 00:08:47.168
Even they end up becoming
Scorpiomon's food

00:08:47.201 --> 00:08:48.536
if they get captured.

00:08:50.971 --> 00:08:53.274
Sadly, the same
thing has happened

00:08:53.307 --> 00:08:55.342
to many friends.

00:08:55.376 --> 00:08:58.846
I greatly appreciate
you saving the Kyaromon.

00:08:58.879 --> 00:08:59.847
Thank you.

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:02.349
(Kyaroman chirping)

00:09:02.383 --> 00:09:03.350
(Joe screams)

00:09:03.384 --> 00:09:04.351
Oh. Uh.

00:09:04.385 --> 00:09:05.820
You're welcome!

00:09:05.853 --> 00:09:07.021
Oh, and by the way,

00:09:07.054 --> 00:09:08.823
will your entire group be going?

00:09:08.856 --> 00:09:10.958
To Leomon's place, I mean?

00:09:10.991 --> 00:09:12.526
Hmm, Leomon?

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:14.695
Oh. Was I wrong?

00:09:14.728 --> 00:09:18.032
We're actually trying to
find the Celestial Digimon.

00:09:18.065 --> 00:09:19.533
Celestial?

00:09:19.567 --> 00:09:22.303
Just what kind of
Digimon is this "Leomon?"

00:09:22.336 --> 00:09:24.472
Right now, there
are vicious Digimon

00:09:24.505 --> 00:09:26.640
that have been enveloped
in dark miasma.

00:09:26.674 --> 00:09:29.510
And they're running wild
all over this continent.

00:09:29.543 --> 00:09:31.479
Leomon seems to be
building an army

00:09:31.512 --> 00:09:33.747
to fight against
those dark Digimon.

00:09:34.582 --> 00:09:35.883
A resistance.

00:09:35.916 --> 00:09:37.818
That's what he is leading.

00:09:37.852 --> 00:09:40.054
Although, I doubt that
they have anything

00:09:40.087 --> 00:09:42.656
to do with the Digimon
you're looking for.

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:45.226
Are all of you going to
fight alongside Leomon, too?

00:09:45.259 --> 00:09:48.195
Digimon like us are nowhere
near powerful enough

00:09:48.229 --> 00:09:50.164
to offer any help in a fight.

00:09:50.197 --> 00:09:53.234
But, if we're able to
join up with Leomon,

00:09:53.267 --> 00:09:54.735
then we'll be protected.

00:09:54.768 --> 00:09:56.837
That's the reason why
we're so determined

00:09:56.871 --> 00:09:58.038
to cross the desert.

00:09:59.206 --> 00:10:01.509
[Sora] But Scorpiomon
is out there right now!

00:10:01.542 --> 00:10:03.010
[Joe] Yeah!

00:10:03.043 --> 00:10:05.546
And don't forget there are
Sandyanmamon in the sky!

00:10:05.579 --> 00:10:07.248
Forget about
crossing the desert!

00:10:07.281 --> 00:10:08.616
It's way too risky!

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:12.019
[Neemon] But staying here
isn't an option either.

00:10:12.052 --> 00:10:14.755
Eventually, we'll be caught
and become their prey.

00:10:14.788 --> 00:10:17.191
That's the reason why we've
made the decision to go

00:10:17.224 --> 00:10:18.692
no matter what it takes.

00:10:18.726 --> 00:10:20.928
We're going to do
this for their sakes.

00:10:22.897 --> 00:10:24.031
All right, then.

00:10:24.064 --> 00:10:26.567
If that's the case, I say
that we should go with them!

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:28.269
Uh, aren't you gonna
ask my opinion?

00:10:28.302 --> 00:10:29.270
(Gomamon grunts)

00:10:29.303 --> 00:10:31.272
If our group's bigger
than it has to be,

00:10:31.305 --> 00:10:32.540
then it'll slow us down.

00:10:32.573 --> 00:10:35.242
I'm afraid we just don't
have time for that.

00:10:35.276 --> 00:10:36.777
But, Matt...

00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:39.547
Listen, we have our own
mission to accomplish.

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:42.383
Or have you guys forgotten
everything that Izzy told us?

00:10:42.416 --> 00:10:43.551
(Sora whimpers)

00:10:43.584 --> 00:10:44.718
[Joe] No, we haven't.

00:10:44.752 --> 00:10:47.388
There's no end in sight to
the power outage in Tokyo.

00:10:47.421 --> 00:10:49.456
The other utilities
have shut down, too.

00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:51.225
People can't survive
there for much longer,

00:10:51.258 --> 00:10:52.626
so they're fleeing the city.

00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:54.728
But that's not even the
end of the bad news!

00:10:54.762 --> 00:10:56.564
The outages are spreading
outside the city

00:10:56.597 --> 00:10:58.599
to the entire metropolitan area.

00:10:58.632 --> 00:11:01.268
And we're the only ones
who can fix all of it.

00:11:01.302 --> 00:11:02.903
You get that, right?

00:11:02.937 --> 00:11:03.904
'Course we do!

00:11:03.938 --> 00:11:05.573
We're worried about home, too.

00:11:05.606 --> 00:11:06.607
Yeah, but still,

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:08.475
we can't just ignore
these Digimon in need

00:11:08.509 --> 00:11:10.578
when they're standing
right in front of us!

00:11:10.611 --> 00:11:11.779
Do you really think

00:11:11.812 --> 00:11:13.480
you can protect
this many of them?

00:11:13.514 --> 00:11:15.950
(Sora and Joe sighing)

00:11:15.983 --> 00:11:17.985
Thank you for your
thoughtfulness.

00:11:18.018 --> 00:11:21.121
We certainly appreciate all
the concern that you've shown.

00:11:21.155 --> 00:11:23.924
But please, you don't
need to worry about us.

00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:25.125
No way.

00:11:25.159 --> 00:11:26.927
We're definitely going
along with you guys.

00:11:26.961 --> 00:11:27.962
Yeah!

00:11:29.063 --> 00:11:31.265
Oh, boy. They both make
some good points, though.

00:11:31.298 --> 00:11:33.200
So, what do you
think we should do?

00:11:34.702 --> 00:11:35.869
Do whatever you want.

00:11:37.638 --> 00:11:39.306
Gabumon, lets go.

00:11:40.641 --> 00:11:42.209
Uhh, hold on a minute!

00:11:43.143 --> 00:11:45.512
No, Joe. It's okay, really.

00:11:45.546 --> 00:11:46.513
But-!

00:11:46.547 --> 00:11:48.148
So? What'll it be?

00:11:52.219 --> 00:11:55.222
(Kyaromon chirping)

00:11:56.490 --> 00:11:58.158
Okay! Count me in, too!

00:11:58.192 --> 00:12:00.027
I can't just abandon
them, either!

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:01.462
That's the spirit!

00:12:01.495 --> 00:12:03.197
Lets do it Joe!

00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:04.565
Thank you all.

00:12:05.899 --> 00:12:07.668
We're here for you.

00:12:12.239 --> 00:12:13.974
(steps trudging)

00:12:14.008 --> 00:12:16.343
But, Matt, aren't you
going to tell the others?

00:12:16.377 --> 00:12:18.078
I mean, what's
going on with you?

00:12:19.513 --> 00:12:22.383
If you don't tell them, then
they're never gonna understand.

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:25.653
It's a lot of weight
on your shoulders.

00:12:25.686 --> 00:12:27.388
Don't carry it all by yourself.

00:12:28.555 --> 00:12:29.556
But I have you.

00:12:31.392 --> 00:12:33.027
Honestly, that's all I need.

00:12:35.062 --> 00:12:37.698
(buoyant music)

00:12:38.932 --> 00:12:41.402
[Sora] Here we go, Biyomon!

00:12:41.435 --> 00:12:43.537
Biyomon digivolve to...

00:12:44.705 --> 00:12:45.706
Birdramon!

00:12:46.407 --> 00:12:47.675
Gomamon!

00:12:47.708 --> 00:12:49.743
Gomamon digivolve to...

00:12:51.712 --> 00:12:52.713
Ikkakumon!

00:12:53.614 --> 00:12:54.615
Whoa!

00:12:55.616 --> 00:12:57.017
We'll lure those
SandYanmamon away

00:12:57.051 --> 00:12:59.186
so they don't go
after the rest of you!

00:12:59.219 --> 00:13:00.354
Joe and Ikkakumon,

00:13:00.387 --> 00:13:02.256
you take care of
Neemon and his group

00:13:02.289 --> 00:13:03.290
Okay, got it!

00:13:04.458 --> 00:13:06.026
All right, you guys, hop on!

00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:07.528
We'll make sure
that you stay safe

00:13:07.561 --> 00:13:09.430
while we're traveling
through the desert!

00:13:09.463 --> 00:13:16.537
-(sand whooshing)
-(heroic music)

00:13:31.143 --> 00:13:34.146
(gadget whirring)

00:13:34.179 --> 00:13:36.949
(sand whooshing)

00:13:39.318 --> 00:13:41.820
I hope this goes okay.

00:13:41.854 --> 00:13:43.589
(wings buzzing)

00:13:43.622 --> 00:13:44.990
(intense instrumental music)

00:13:45.023 --> 00:13:46.759
Sora, here they come!

00:13:46.792 --> 00:13:48.327
Let's go, Birdramon!

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:49.361
Right!

00:13:50.696 --> 00:13:52.798
There's a bunch more
of them this time!

00:13:52.831 --> 00:13:55.134
Come on! We've gotta
back up Birdramon!

00:13:55.968 --> 00:13:57.002
Okay!

00:13:57.035 --> 00:13:58.370
Harpoon Torpedo!

00:14:00.139 --> 00:14:02.107
(torpedo whistling)

00:14:02.141 --> 00:14:03.776
(torpedo exploding)

00:14:03.809 --> 00:14:05.677
(wings buzzing)

00:14:05.711 --> 00:14:08.947
(Sandyanmamon screeches)

00:14:08.981 --> 00:14:10.849
[Ikkakumon] The dust
devils will swallow us up!

00:14:10.883 --> 00:14:13.519
Ikkakumon, retreat!

00:14:13.552 --> 00:14:14.620
(wings buzzing)

00:14:14.653 --> 00:14:16.288
(Ikkakumon yelps)

00:14:16.321 --> 00:14:17.389
Everyone, jump off!

00:14:18.657 --> 00:14:21.326
Are you sure about this?

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:23.028
(torpedoes beaming)

00:14:23.061 --> 00:14:26.131
(torpedoes whooshing)

00:14:26.165 --> 00:14:28.300
(Ikkakumon grunts)

00:14:28.333 --> 00:14:31.003
(wings buzzing)

00:14:34.239 --> 00:14:35.474
[Joe and Kyaromons] No!

00:14:35.507 --> 00:14:37.342
Ikkakumon is trapped!

00:14:37.376 --> 00:14:40.212
-(wings buzzing)
-(Ikkakumon growls)

00:14:40.245 --> 00:14:42.815
Ikkakumon!

00:14:42.848 --> 00:14:45.551
(claw slicing)

00:14:45.584 --> 00:14:47.553
(wings buzzing)

00:14:47.586 --> 00:14:49.388
We've gotta shake this guy off!

00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:52.991
(Sandyanmamon screeches)

00:14:53.025 --> 00:14:55.394
They're making those
dust devils again!

00:14:55.427 --> 00:14:57.896
Birdramon, what are we gonna do?

00:14:57.930 --> 00:14:59.331
Just hold on tight!

00:14:59.364 --> 00:15:02.034
(wind whooshes)

00:15:03.235 --> 00:15:04.203
(Sandyanmamon screeches)

00:15:04.236 --> 00:15:06.171
(Birdramon screams)

00:15:06.205 --> 00:15:07.840
Go, Birdramon!

00:15:07.873 --> 00:15:09.908
(gadget whirring)

00:15:09.942 --> 00:15:12.544
(heroic music)

00:15:14.913 --> 00:15:17.049
(fire explodes)

00:15:17.082 --> 00:15:20.519
(Sandyanmamon explodes)

00:15:20.552 --> 00:15:22.554
We did it!

00:15:22.588 --> 00:15:23.922
(Sora gasps)

00:15:23.956 --> 00:15:25.357
(Birdramon grunts)

00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:27.259
(Sora and Birdramon screams)

00:15:27.292 --> 00:15:29.895
(ground thuds)

00:15:31.797 --> 00:15:34.066
Hey, Biyomon! Are you okay?

00:15:35.067 --> 00:15:36.535
Yeah, somehow.

00:15:36.568 --> 00:15:37.769
(ground rumbles)

00:15:37.803 --> 00:15:39.705
(claw shines)

00:15:39.738 --> 00:15:42.274
(Sora and Biyomon gasps)

00:15:42.307 --> 00:15:43.542
Ikkakumon!

00:15:43.575 --> 00:15:45.043
Sora and Biyomon!

00:15:45.077 --> 00:15:48.881
(Ikkakumon grunting)

00:15:48.914 --> 00:15:50.082
(claw swims upward)

00:15:50.115 --> 00:15:53.118
(Ikkakumon screams)

00:15:54.419 --> 00:15:55.420
You all right?!

00:15:57.322 --> 00:15:58.790

(Biyomon and Sora gasps)

00:16:09.635 --> 00:16:12.271
Garurumon, go get them.

00:16:12.304 --> 00:16:15.173
(Garurumon growls)

00:16:17.476 --> 00:16:18.443
Now Fire!

00:16:18.477 --> 00:16:21.313
(gadget whirring)

00:16:25.017 --> 00:16:27.986
(Garurumon sizzling)

00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:30.088
(Biyomon and Sora gasping)

00:16:30.122 --> 00:16:31.990
(Joe gasping)

00:16:32.024 --> 00:16:34.293
(claw whooshing)

00:16:34.326 --> 00:16:36.495
(ground thuds)

00:16:36.528 --> 00:16:39.598
(claws clanks)

00:16:39.631 --> 00:16:42.301
(laser rumbles)

00:16:44.636 --> 00:16:48.173
(Skullscorpiomon screeches)

00:16:48.206 --> 00:16:49.808
Growling Blaster!

00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:54.713
(heroic music continues)

00:16:58.483 --> 00:17:01.787
(laser rumbling)

00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:05.390
(Skullscorpiomon explodes)

00:17:07.526 --> 00:17:10.462
(Skullscorpiomon roars)

00:17:10.495 --> 00:17:12.864
I knew it, an ultimate Digimon.

00:17:12.898 --> 00:17:15.167
(Matt grunts)

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:16.401
[Matt] But I have you.

00:17:18.403 --> 00:17:19.838
Honestly, that's all I need.

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:23.508
We can't just ignore
these Digimons in need

00:17:23.542 --> 00:17:25.711
when they're standing
right in front of us!

00:17:27.346 --> 00:17:28.547
Do you really think

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:30.315
you can protect
this many of them?

00:17:30.349 --> 00:17:33.251
(melancholy music)

00:17:48.867 --> 00:17:51.370
(gadget whirs)

00:17:53.438 --> 00:17:56.274
(Garurumon roars)

00:18:01.113 --> 00:18:02.114
Garurumon!

00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:07.019
Garurumon,

00:18:07.052 --> 00:18:12.057
-digivolve to...
-(rock music)

00:18:16.228 --> 00:18:21.233
-(ground thuds)
-(rock music continues)

00:18:23.635 --> 00:18:26.705
(singing in Japanese)

00:18:26.738 --> 00:18:27.906
WereGarurumon!

00:18:31.743 --> 00:18:34.146
No way, we just
unlocked our new power.

00:18:35.247 --> 00:18:36.748
WereGarurumon...

00:18:39.084 --> 00:18:43.288
[Ikkakumon] That's
an Ultimate Digimon!

00:18:43.321 --> 00:18:46.625
(sand explodes)

00:18:46.658 --> 00:18:48.293
(Skullscorpiomon roars)

00:18:48.326 --> 00:18:51.296

(claw thuds)

00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:57.235
(wind chimes)

00:18:57.269 --> 00:18:58.270
Whoa!

00:18:59.171 --> 00:19:02.474
(WereGarurumon grunts)

00:19:09.514 --> 00:19:12.417
(claws swiping)

00:19:12.451 --> 00:19:15.120
(foot stomping)

00:19:19.458 --> 00:19:21.326
(wind chimes)

00:19:21.359 --> 00:19:25.764
(Skullscorpiomon screeches)

00:19:25.797 --> 00:19:26.798
Wolf Claw!

00:19:33.839 --> 00:19:36.341
(wind chimes)

00:19:36.374 --> 00:19:39.878
(WereGarurumon screaming)

00:19:41.179 --> 00:19:42.514
WereGarurumon.

00:19:45.217 --> 00:19:48.019
(WereGarurumon chuckles)

00:19:48.053 --> 00:19:51.389
(WereGarurumon shrinks)

00:19:54.359 --> 00:19:56.728
(hand smack)

00:19:58.330 --> 00:20:01.032
[Neemon] Thank you so much
for all of your help, humans!

00:20:01.066 --> 00:20:03.001
[Biyomon] I hope that you're
able to make your journey

00:20:03.034 --> 00:20:05.203
to see Leomon safely!

00:20:05.237 --> 00:20:07.038
(Biyomon giggles)

00:20:07.072 --> 00:20:08.306
Huh?

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:11.309
And thank you for
coming back to help.

00:20:11.343 --> 00:20:14.146
I knew that if I left, you
guys would make a move.

00:20:14.179 --> 00:20:16.381
And once you did,
they'd make a move, too.

00:20:16.414 --> 00:20:18.650
That's what this was about?!

00:20:18.683 --> 00:20:20.519
So we were just bait?!

00:20:20.552 --> 00:20:21.653
Well,

00:20:21.686 --> 00:20:24.222
maybe we should just leave
it at that for right now.

00:20:26.024 --> 00:20:28.493
I have a little brother
who's back home.

00:20:28.527 --> 00:20:31.062
His name is TK.

00:20:31.096 --> 00:20:32.831
He's living in Tokyo right now.

00:20:32.864 --> 00:20:33.865
[Sora And Joe] Huh?

00:20:35.267 --> 00:20:36.234
[Matt] I don't know

00:20:36.268 --> 00:20:38.069
whether he's already
evacuated the city,

00:20:38.103 --> 00:20:40.005
or if he's still
trapped in the chaos

00:20:40.038 --> 00:20:42.073
that's enveloped
the whole place.

00:20:42.107 --> 00:20:43.542
But I'm sure that his heart

00:20:43.575 --> 00:20:46.511
must be so filled
with fear right now.

00:20:46.545 --> 00:20:48.513
When I think about that,

00:20:48.547 --> 00:20:51.216
there's no way I can sit
still and do nothing.

00:20:51.249 --> 00:20:53.084
That's why you
rushed in like that?

00:20:54.119 --> 00:20:56.021
I don't know why were
all the Digidestined

00:20:56.054 --> 00:20:57.923
and I don't care.

00:20:57.956 --> 00:20:59.858
As long as it remains
possible for me

00:20:59.891 --> 00:21:02.561
to ensure that my brother
can still live in peace,

00:21:02.594 --> 00:21:04.095
I'll keep doing it.

00:21:04.129 --> 00:21:06.731
Thanks so much for
telling us that!

00:21:06.765 --> 00:21:08.099
I'm so glad that
I have the chance

00:21:08.133 --> 00:21:09.701
to get to know you better!

00:21:09.734 --> 00:21:10.936
And in return,

00:21:10.969 --> 00:21:12.771
allow me to tell you a
little bit about myself.

00:21:12.804 --> 00:21:14.773
Actually, I think that we've
heard all that already.

00:21:14.806 --> 00:21:16.541
Yeah, but he hasn't yet!

00:21:16.575 --> 00:21:18.610
We're kinda in a rush, Joe.

00:21:18.643 --> 00:21:20.912
There you go Matt,
isn't that better?

00:21:24.082 --> 00:21:25.083
Maybe.

00:21:29.654 --> 00:21:32.490
(camera clicking)

00:21:33.258 --> 00:21:34.226
Hey!

00:21:34.259 --> 00:21:35.227
Come on Izzy.

00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:36.294
We've gotta keep moving!

00:21:36.328 --> 00:21:37.596
Hold on a second.

00:21:37.629 --> 00:21:38.897
Just a bit longer.

00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:41.800
Is some wall really that
interesting?! C'mon!

00:21:41.833 --> 00:21:43.802
It very well might
come in handy someday,

00:21:43.835 --> 00:21:45.804
so let's just take a
moment to analyze it.

00:21:45.837 --> 00:21:47.639
He's forgotten what the goal is.

00:21:47.672 --> 00:21:50.075
If we keep on taking pictures
of everything in here

00:21:50.108 --> 00:21:51.076
we're done!

00:21:51.109 --> 00:21:52.444
We'll never get through it!

00:21:53.445 --> 00:21:55.080
Palmon, can you read this?

00:21:55.113 --> 00:21:56.414
(pressure plate pushed)

00:21:56.448 --> 00:21:58.116
