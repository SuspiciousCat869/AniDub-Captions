[Narrator] This is
the mysterious world

where Digimon live.

The Digital World.

00:01:46.156 --> 00:01:48.492
Here, Tai and the
other Digi-destined,

00:01:48.492 --> 00:01:50.785
alongside their partner Digimon,

00:01:50.827 --> 00:01:54.915
at last, succeeded in finding
the key to saving the world

00:01:54.956 --> 00:01:57.834
by meeting the Celestial
Digimon, Patamon.

00:01:58.502 --> 00:02:01.129
Thus, their primary
mission was fulfilled.

00:02:02.297 --> 00:02:04.966
(magical music)

00:02:07.344 --> 00:02:09.471
But there was still
a battle to be fought

00:02:09.513 --> 00:02:12.432
against DanDevimon,
the crazed Mega Digimon

00:02:12.474 --> 00:02:14.434
who digivolved by
absorbing energy

00:02:14.476 --> 00:02:16.353

Tai and the others
managed to survive.

00:02:25.195 --> 00:02:27.197
But destiny wasted no time

-Huh?

00:02:45.048 --> 00:02:47.717

00:02:47.717 --> 00:02:48.718

Er, guys.

00:02:50.011 --> 00:02:51.012

Repeat, this is not a drill.

Now an update on
that tanker collision

00:03:42.272 --> 00:03:43.857
in the Strait of Hormus.

00:03:43.898 --> 00:03:45.692
Earlier today, the
White House announced

00:03:45.734 --> 00:03:46.943
that the possibility of this

00:03:46.943 --> 00:03:49.362
being an act of terrorism
has not been ruled out

00:03:49.404 --> 00:03:51.656
and appropriate measures
have been taken.

00:03:51.698 --> 00:03:53.575
Fighter jets have
been sent to the area

00:03:53.617 --> 00:03:57.704
by a U.S. carrier fleet situated
off the coast of Bahrain.

00:03:57.746 --> 00:04:00.123
Consequently, tensions
between nations in the region

00:04:00.123 --> 00:04:02.709
are rising, and the risk
of military conflict

00:04:02.751 --> 00:04:05.587
in the Strait of
Hormus has spiked.

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:08.548
Oh no, this is turning
into a really big problem.

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.383
Wait, I've read about this.

00:04:10.425 --> 00:04:12.385
Unlike the Strait of Malacca,

00:04:12.427 --> 00:04:14.638
there's already been a
lotta military tension

00:04:14.638 --> 00:04:15.889
between the U.S. and Iran

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.807
in the Strait of
Hormus in the past.

00:04:17.807 --> 00:04:19.809
An accident there,
of all places.

00:04:19.809 --> 00:04:21.102
Yeah, what about it?

00:04:21.144 --> 00:04:23.396
Would be more
dangerous than ever.

00:04:23.438 --> 00:04:25.273
An accident right
there, right now

00:04:25.315 --> 00:04:26.941
could very well lead to war.

00:04:26.983 --> 00:04:28.068
(all gasping)

00:04:28.109 --> 00:04:30.236
The Digimon's
infiltration of the AIS.

00:04:30.278 --> 00:04:31.780
is spreading more and more.

00:04:32.822 --> 00:04:34.991
Hmm, the AI-what?

00:04:34.991 --> 00:04:35.992
AIS.

00:04:35.992 --> 00:04:37.994
Hey, at least you
got the A right,

00:04:37.994 --> 00:04:39.329
it was a valiant effort.

00:04:39.329 --> 00:04:41.456
-Thanks for playing.
-(Mimi scoffing)

00:04:41.498 --> 00:04:44.584
The AIS is a system that
uses digital GPS signals

00:04:44.626 --> 00:04:46.503
to identify a ship's location.

00:04:46.503 --> 00:04:48.588
So you always know
where that ship is.

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:49.589
-Oh.
-Hmm-uh.

00:04:49.631 --> 00:04:50.590
Yeah.

00:04:50.632 --> 00:04:52.759
So then that means that the AIS

00:04:52.801 --> 00:04:54.469
is part of the network as well.

00:04:54.511 --> 00:04:57.514
And the infiltration of the
AIS is only getting worse?

00:04:57.514 --> 00:04:58.598
-Yeah.
-(computer buzzing)

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.600
It's the same thing
as when that tanker

00:05:00.642 --> 00:05:02.102
went out of control.

00:05:02.143 --> 00:05:04.646
But it's on a whole
different level this time.

00:05:04.688 --> 00:05:06.439
(Sora gasping)

00:05:06.481 --> 00:05:08.483
(flames blazing)

00:05:08.525 --> 00:05:10.944

00:05:10.985 --> 00:05:13.029

00:05:20.704 --> 00:05:22.288
Wait a minute.

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.833
(tense music)

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:35.510
What am I seeing?

00:05:35.552 --> 00:05:37.011
What the heck's going on?

00:05:37.053 --> 00:05:40.223
Weren't we just sinking under
the sea a minute or two ago?

00:05:40.223 --> 00:05:41.224
That's what I thought.

00:05:41.224 --> 00:05:43.184
Why are we falling
out of the sky now?

00:05:43.226 --> 00:05:44.394

Hey, hold on, is that
the Cloud Continent?

00:05:53.695 --> 00:05:54.738
I think so.

00:05:55.697 --> 00:05:57.574
Which means that we (groans),

00:05:57.574 --> 00:06:00.076
while we were traveling
across land and sea,

00:06:00.076 --> 00:06:02.996
that whole time we were
actually on top of that?

00:06:03.037 --> 00:06:05.415
Well, we're sure not
on top of it anymore.

00:06:05.415 --> 00:06:07.709

happen to us now?

Er, hey, Matt?

00:06:25.894 --> 00:06:29.063
I'm not really clear on
what happened after Devimon,

00:06:29.105 --> 00:06:31.191
you know, went
and gobbled me up.

But, we did beat
Devimon, didn't we?

00:06:38.239 --> 00:06:41.201
Yeah.

But as far as what actually
happened back there...

bit as good as mine.

00:06:55.632 --> 00:06:57.133

00:08:19.841 --> 00:08:22.218
[Megakabuterimon] We're
counting on you, Izzy.

00:08:22.218 --> 00:08:23.344
(Sora gasping)

00:08:23.386 --> 00:08:24.470
(worrisome music)

00:08:24.512 --> 00:08:25.680
[Sora] Kari?

00:08:27.015 --> 00:08:29.684
(air whooshing)

00:08:31.561 --> 00:08:33.062
(tense music)

00:08:33.062 --> 00:08:34.564
A sea of clouds.

00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:37.233
How far are we gonna fall?

00:08:37.233 --> 00:08:40.320
-(Tai gasping)
-(TK groaning)

00:08:40.361 --> 00:08:42.864
(Digimon snickering)

00:08:42.906 --> 00:08:47.243
-(TK groaning)
-What are those?

00:08:47.243 --> 00:08:49.329
(both yelling)

00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:50.496
[Patamon] They're Mamemon.

00:08:50.538 --> 00:08:55.543
And the big ones are Bigmamemon.

00:08:56.586 --> 00:09:00.757
-(worrisome music)
-(Digimon snickering)

00:09:03.885 --> 00:09:06.346
(explosion booming)

00:09:06.387 --> 00:09:08.264
(all groaning)

00:09:08.264 --> 00:09:10.767
(all yelling)

00:09:13.603 --> 00:09:16.105
(explosions booming)

00:09:16.105 --> 00:09:18.691
(ElDradimon growling)

00:09:18.733 --> 00:09:20.276
(Digimon squeaking)

00:09:20.276 --> 00:09:23.279
(explosion booming)

00:09:24.238 --> 00:09:25.531
-(all thudding)
-(all groaning)

00:09:25.573 --> 00:09:27.283
(Tai groaning)

00:09:27.283 --> 00:09:30.286
(Digimon squeaking)

00:09:35.625 --> 00:09:38.586
-(explosion booming)
-(all groaning)

00:09:38.628 --> 00:09:40.380
What's with these guys?

00:09:40.421 --> 00:09:42.048
They'll annihilate
anything that happens

00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:43.967
to get in the way of the swarm.

00:09:43.967 --> 00:09:46.260
It doesn't matter if
it's friend or foe.

00:09:46.302 --> 00:09:48.262
Man, they're relentless.

00:09:48.304 --> 00:09:50.640
Where do they all keep
coming from anyway?

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:52.475
Tai, I...

00:09:52.475 --> 00:09:54.477
I'm all out of energy.

00:09:54.477 --> 00:09:55.937
I know the feeling.

00:09:55.979 --> 00:09:56.938
(Gabumon groaning)

00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:58.147
Just hang in there.

00:09:59.941 --> 00:10:01.067
(Digimon squeaking)

00:10:01.109 --> 00:10:02.443
Check that dude out.

00:10:02.485 --> 00:10:04.320
Looks like a balloon with feet.

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:06.072
Don't tell me you're impressed?

00:10:06.114 --> 00:10:10.576
-(explosion booming)
-(Tai groaning)

00:10:10.618 --> 00:10:12.245
(Digimon squeaking)

00:10:12.286 --> 00:10:13.997
(all gasping)

00:10:13.997 --> 00:10:17.000
(explosion booming)

00:10:18.793 --> 00:10:21.170
(all yelling)

00:10:22.505 --> 00:10:25.967
(all screaming)

00:10:32.598 --> 00:10:35.435
-(air whooshing)
-(logo jingling)

00:10:35.435 --> 00:10:38.104
(all screaming)

00:10:40.732 --> 00:10:41.733
Huh?

00:10:42.567 --> 00:10:45.403
(Leomon whooshing)

00:10:47.071 --> 00:10:48.031
Leomon.

00:10:48.072 --> 00:10:49.032
You all right?

00:10:49.073 --> 00:10:50.033
We are now.

00:10:50.074 --> 00:10:51.117
Perfect timing.

00:10:51.117 --> 00:10:52.744
Wow, thanks a lot.

00:10:52.785 --> 00:10:54.287
We were following you guys,

00:10:54.287 --> 00:10:56.789
and we thought we were
headed for Devimon's castle

00:10:56.789 --> 00:10:58.750
until this happened.

00:10:58.791 --> 00:11:02.295
Though to be honest, I
have no idea what this is.

00:11:02.295 --> 00:11:04.547
Well, we're both on
the same page there.

00:11:04.589 --> 00:11:07.300
[Leomon] In any case, we're
happy to reunite with you.

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:13.639
(Digimon squeaking)

00:11:13.639 --> 00:11:16.225
(ElDradimon roaring)

00:11:16.267 --> 00:11:18.478
That Digimon is
crying out for help.

00:11:18.478 --> 00:11:20.480
-You can tell that?
-Hmm-uh.

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:23.566
Hey, Leomon, isn't that
one of Deivimon's henchmen?

00:11:23.608 --> 00:11:27.612
Hold on, could that
really be ElDradimon?

00:11:27.987 --> 00:11:29.238
That's right.

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:31.157
He's been around ever
since the ancient times.

00:11:31.157 --> 00:11:33.409
He's a mega-level Digimon.

00:11:33.451 --> 00:11:35.995
I'd always heard rumors
that ElDradimon existed

00:11:35.995 --> 00:11:37.330
somewhere on the Cloud Continent

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:39.832
but to think I'd
see the real thing.

00:11:39.832 --> 00:11:43.419
But what would make such a
Digimon serve under Devimon?

00:11:43.461 --> 00:11:46.089
ElDradimon was a strong Digimon.

00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:49.342
But then the miasma
swamps that emerged

00:11:49.342 --> 00:11:52.178
across the continent
tainted ElDradimon's body.

00:11:53.679 --> 00:11:55.014
And the weakened ElDradimon

00:11:55.014 --> 00:11:57.350
was taken advantage
of by Devimon.

00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:59.477
So that's what happened.

00:11:59.519 --> 00:12:01.771
By the way, who is that?

00:12:01.813 --> 00:12:04.816
(chuckles) That's Patomon,
the Celestial Digimon.

00:12:04.857 --> 00:12:06.317
The what?

00:12:06.359 --> 00:12:10.196
It looks like ElDradimon
still can't move very well

00:12:10.196 --> 00:12:13.116
after being bound by
miasma for so long.

00:12:13.157 --> 00:12:15.868
If falls in this condition...

00:12:15.868 --> 00:12:17.328
(TK gasping)

00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:19.705
ElDradimon needs
our help, you guys.

00:12:19.705 --> 00:12:21.707
After all, if it wasn't for him,

00:12:21.707 --> 00:12:24.127
I would never have met Patamon.

00:12:24.168 --> 00:12:27.004
(uplifting music)

00:12:28.339 --> 00:12:30.383
All right, let's do it.

00:12:32.051 --> 00:12:33.845
Yeah, let's do it.

00:12:33.886 --> 00:12:34.887
We'll all do it.

00:12:37.348 --> 00:12:38.391
Count me in.

00:12:38.391 --> 00:12:40.226
Me too, Matt.

00:12:40.226 --> 00:12:41.978
Will you help us too, Leomon?

00:12:42.019 --> 00:12:43.229
Certainly.

00:12:43.229 --> 00:12:45.022
But have you
developed a plan yet?

00:12:46.858 --> 00:12:48.234
Oh, yeah.

00:12:48.234 --> 00:12:49.986
All right, then.

00:12:50.027 --> 00:12:52.530
Agumon and Gabumon
look exhausted

00:12:52.572 --> 00:12:54.699
so if there's any heavy
lifting to be done,

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:57.326
it might be best if
you leave it to us.

00:12:57.368 --> 00:12:58.369
Let's go.

00:13:00.413 --> 00:13:03.499
(ElDradimon growling)

00:13:03.541 --> 00:13:05.418
(computer beeping)

00:13:05.418 --> 00:13:06.669
Is something wrong?

00:13:06.711 --> 00:13:09.088
Just wondering what
you're all doing.

00:13:09.088 --> 00:13:13.384
Oh, uh, it's kind of
hard to explain, Kari.

00:13:13.426 --> 00:13:15.386
Do we have any
countermeasures yet?

00:13:15.428 --> 00:13:17.221
It's still analyzing.

00:13:17.263 --> 00:13:19.056
-But don't worry.
-(tense music)

00:13:19.098 --> 00:13:20.725
(electrical buzzing)

00:13:20.766 --> 00:13:23.352
-(boat horn honking)
-(ships booming)

00:13:23.394 --> 00:13:25.104
I will find the solution.

00:13:25.104 --> 00:13:26.939
(computer beeping)

00:13:26.939 --> 00:13:29.108
-(containers booming)
-(waves crashing)

00:13:29.108 --> 00:13:31.777
(computer beeping)

00:13:31.777 --> 00:13:34.405
(Kari gasping)

00:13:35.406 --> 00:13:38.576
(ElDradimon groaning)

00:13:44.123 --> 00:13:45.249
Here comes the ocean.

00:13:45.291 --> 00:13:46.375
What do we do?

00:13:46.417 --> 00:13:48.920
[Tai] If we hit the water
going at this speed...

00:13:48.961 --> 00:13:51.631
[Agumon] We'll be
smashed to smithereens.

00:13:51.631 --> 00:13:53.633
We gotta make a soft landing.

00:13:53.633 --> 00:13:56.385
Just like with a disabled plane.

00:13:56.427 --> 00:13:59.222
Get us down closer
to ElDradimon.

00:13:59.263 --> 00:14:01.766
(tense music)

00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:10.650
Hey, Leomon, is there any way

00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:13.402
you can get ElDradimon's
body to level out?

00:14:13.444 --> 00:14:16.656
I'll sure try, but it
might get a little rough.

00:14:19.492 --> 00:14:22.495
(Digimon squeaking)

00:14:24.664 --> 00:14:27.750
(Leomon growling)

00:14:27.792 --> 00:14:31.337
[Leomon] Fist of the Beast King.

00:14:31.337 --> 00:14:33.297
(explosion booming)

00:14:33.339 --> 00:14:36.509
(ElDradimon growling)

00:14:40.012 --> 00:14:43.015
(Digimon squeaking)

00:14:45.351 --> 00:14:48.479
(ElDradimon growling)

00:14:51.691 --> 00:14:52.692
Yes.

00:14:52.692 --> 00:14:54.235
Now comes the hard part.

00:14:59.865 --> 00:15:02.285
Come on, Tai, you got this.

00:15:02.326 --> 00:15:03.369
Do it, Matt.

00:15:03.369 --> 00:15:04.620
(all gasping)

00:15:04.662 --> 00:15:07.331
(tense music)

00:15:07.373 --> 00:15:09.333
(all yelling)

00:15:09.375 --> 00:15:11.127
[Patamon] Boom Bubble.

00:15:11.168 --> 00:15:13.838
(sword whooshing)

00:15:13.879 --> 00:15:16.882
(Digimon squeaking)

00:15:20.553 --> 00:15:23.723
(ElDradimon groaning)

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:31.647
ElDradimon, sorry, I know
that had to be painful.

00:15:31.689 --> 00:15:34.233
We're just trying to make
sure you land safely.

00:15:34.233 --> 00:15:35.234
Okay, get ready.

00:15:36.861 --> 00:15:39.238
(Digimon squeaking)

00:15:39.238 --> 00:15:41.574
(feet stomping)

00:15:41.574 --> 00:15:44.577
(Digimon squeaking)

00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:48.873
(explosions booming)

00:15:48.914 --> 00:15:50.875
(both groaning)

00:15:50.916 --> 00:15:52.418
I'll handle them.

00:15:57.214 --> 00:16:00.051
(Leomon grunting)

00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:06.265
(explosions booming)

00:16:07.767 --> 00:16:11.020
-(Digimon squeaking)
-(Leomon grunting)

00:16:11.062 --> 00:16:13.022
(explosions booming)

00:16:13.064 --> 00:16:17.109
-(Leomon grunting)
-(sword whooshing)

00:16:17.109 --> 00:16:18.110
(Digimon squeaking)

00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:20.029
We're still going too fast.

00:16:20.071 --> 00:16:22.948
There's no way we'll survive
the impact at this speed.

00:16:24.075 --> 00:16:25.368
(Tai groaning)

00:16:25.409 --> 00:16:30.414
-(explosion booming)
-(ElDradimon growling)

00:16:32.917 --> 00:16:34.960
Well, that slowed
us up a little.

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:36.754
ElDradimon, that's good,

00:16:36.796 --> 00:16:38.214
keep your head up
just like that.

00:16:38.255 --> 00:16:39.799
You can do it.

00:16:39.799 --> 00:16:41.133
-(Digimon squeaking)
-(explosion booming)

00:16:41.133 --> 00:16:43.386
(both groaning)

00:16:43.427 --> 00:16:45.137
(Tai groaning)

00:16:45.137 --> 00:16:48.474
-(Digimon squeaking)
-(all groaning)

00:16:48.474 --> 00:16:50.935
(Digimon squeaking)

00:16:50.976 --> 00:16:52.895
(all yelling)

00:16:52.937 --> 00:16:54.230
(sword clanging)

00:16:54.271 --> 00:16:57.149
(Leomon grunting)

00:16:57.149 --> 00:16:58.401
(Digimon squeaking)

00:16:58.442 --> 00:17:00.736
(explosions booming)

00:17:00.778 --> 00:17:01.779
Leomon.

00:17:06.951 --> 00:17:08.744
It still isn't slow enough.

00:17:08.786 --> 00:17:11.288
If we could just soften
the impact at least...

00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:14.125
(both groaning)

00:17:14.166 --> 00:17:15.167
You see that?

00:17:15.167 --> 00:17:16.252
There's our answer.

00:17:16.293 --> 00:17:17.503
Huh?

00:17:17.503 --> 00:17:18.921
It's all or nothing.

00:17:18.963 --> 00:17:21.340

(explosions booming)

00:17:24.635 --> 00:17:26.637
Matt, Tai, be careful.

-(Digimon squeaking)

00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:36.522
Agumon.

00:17:36.522 --> 00:17:37.523
Gabumon.

00:17:38.315 --> 00:17:39.984
All right.

00:17:40.025 --> 00:17:41.485
Let's do it.

00:17:41.527 --> 00:17:44.155
(both yelling)

00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:50.202

00:18:04.341 --> 00:18:07.052

[Garurumon] Garurumon.

00:18:57.061 --> 00:18:58.562
All right, Greymon.

00:18:58.604 --> 00:18:59.563
Garurumon.

00:18:59.605 --> 00:19:00.856
Hey, Tai.

00:19:00.898 --> 00:19:02.942
Sorry for the wait.

00:19:02.942 --> 00:19:04.944
(Leomon grunting)

00:19:04.944 --> 00:19:08.197
Try and shoot those big
ones down towards the ocean.

00:19:08.239 --> 00:19:10.533
You just have to hit 'em.

00:19:10.574 --> 00:19:11.951
[Greymon] Nova Blast.

00:19:12.910 --> 00:19:15.412
[Garurumon] Howling Blaster.

00:19:17.414 --> 00:19:21.043
(blasts whizzing)

00:19:21.085 --> 00:19:24.088

(blast whizzing)

00:19:29.134 --> 00:19:31.637
(upbeat music)

00:19:31.637 --> 00:19:32.638
Nailed it.

00:19:32.638 --> 00:19:33.973
Keep going.

00:19:33.973 --> 00:19:36.392

(singing in Japanese)

00:19:42.314 --> 00:19:44.149
[Garurumon] I'm getting
the hang of this.

00:19:44.149 --> 00:19:45.401
[Greymon] Yeah.

00:19:45.442 --> 00:19:48.279
(blasts whizzing)

00:19:49.154 --> 00:19:50.948
Don't stop now.

00:20:01.166 --> 00:20:03.669
-Almost there.
-Come on.

00:20:03.669 --> 00:20:06.422

(all sighing)

00:21:00.392 --> 00:21:02.061
What a relief.

00:21:02.061 --> 00:21:04.688
(gentle music)

00:21:05.731 --> 00:21:07.650
(both groaning)

00:21:07.691 --> 00:21:09.568
Hey, nice job, Agumon.

00:21:10.736 --> 00:21:12.571
-It was nothing.
-(stomach growling)

00:21:12.571 --> 00:21:15.074
But boy am I hungry.

00:21:15.074 --> 00:21:16.241
(both sighing)

00:21:16.241 --> 00:21:17.493
Yeah, I could eat.

00:21:17.534 --> 00:21:19.578
Hey, man, I'm hungry too.

00:21:22.247 --> 00:21:24.917
(hands slapping)

00:21:28.921 --> 00:21:30.547
-(computer beeping)
-Huh?

00:21:30.589 --> 00:21:32.841
Hey, wait, I've got it.

00:21:32.883 --> 00:21:33.884
[All] Huh?

[Izzy] The Digimon Encyclopedia.

Megakabuterimon.

00:22:44.621 --> 00:22:47.249
When this Digimon
digivolves from Kabuterimon,

00:22:47.291 --> 00:22:50.335
the horn's more prominent
and the body's more muscular.

00:22:50.335 --> 00:22:52.671
The special move is Horn Buster.

00:22:52.671 --> 00:22:54.256
Now, let's check this out.

00:22:54.298 --> 00:22:55.591
Because the body gets bigger,

00:22:55.632 --> 00:22:57.134
it's more comfortable
to ride on.

00:22:57.176 --> 00:22:58.927
There's no need for
a special cushion.

00:22:58.969 --> 00:23:01.138
Though I wouldn't mind
a mount for my tablet.

00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:03.766
I wonder if I
should ask for one.

it be next time?

[Narrator] Tai and the others
battle against the odds

00:23:12.191 --> 00:23:15.319
in an ocean teeming
with enemy Digimon.

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:17.946
Will they survive this
ultimate challenge?

00:23:17.988 --> 00:23:21.366
[Tai] Next time "Break Through
the Sea Monster Barricade".

00:23:21.366 --> 00:23:24.036
