[Narrator] Guided by the
power of the eight crests,

00:01:43.358 --> 00:01:45.194
a new chapter of
the Digi-Destined's

00:01:45.227 --> 00:01:47.863
great adventure had now begun.

00:01:47.896 --> 00:01:49.798
Who knows what
sort of trials and

00:01:49.831 --> 00:01:51.533
tribulations
they'll need to face

00:01:51.567 --> 00:01:54.870
in their fight against
the Great Catastrophe.

00:01:54.903 --> 00:01:57.806
Exhausted from their
battle with Millenniummon,

00:01:57.839 --> 00:02:00.642
Patamon and Gatomon
took off with Joe

00:02:00.676 --> 00:02:02.578
to heal up at the hot springs.

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:04.580
However...

00:02:07.416 --> 00:02:09.718
-What?
-What?

00:02:09.751 --> 00:02:12.487
(group gasping)

00:02:12.521 --> 00:02:15.490
[Group] The hot
springs are gone!

00:02:15.524 --> 00:02:16.892
Why?

00:02:16.925 --> 00:02:19.361
You think we took a
wrong turn somewhere?

00:02:19.394 --> 00:02:21.330
[Joe] This is
definitely the place,

00:02:21.363 --> 00:02:23.232
but they've vanished
into this air!

00:02:23.265 --> 00:02:24.233
(Kari sneezing)

00:02:24.266 --> 00:02:25.534
It's cold.

00:02:25.567 --> 00:02:27.669
We should warm up
inside Komondomon.

00:02:27.703 --> 00:02:29.338
(Kari sighing) But.

00:02:29.371 --> 00:02:32.074
(Komondomon barking)

00:02:32.107 --> 00:02:33.208
Of course.

00:02:33.242 --> 00:02:34.576
Just our luck.

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.246
I promise they were right here.

00:02:37.279 --> 00:02:38.513
-(Joe gasping)
-(Gomamon gasping)

00:02:38.547 --> 00:02:41.516
[Kabukimon] Now wait

(wood planks clicking)

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:45.854

00:02:48.724 --> 00:02:50.425
Ah, but who is that
lurking through

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.527
the steam of the bath?

00:02:52.561 --> 00:02:54.162
Yoh!

00:02:54.196 --> 00:02:55.597
Why, that would
be the continent's

00:02:55.631 --> 00:02:57.466
most stylish Digimon.

00:02:58.967 --> 00:03:00.435

00:03:06.908 --> 00:03:08.210
Okay.

00:03:08.243 --> 00:03:11.380
Anyway, do you know what
happened to the springs?

00:03:11.413 --> 00:03:13.448
'Cause we could use a soak.

00:03:13.482 --> 00:03:15.550
[Kabukimon] It was
a torrid tragedy.

00:03:15.584 --> 00:03:17.085
The weather grew colder and

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:20.422
every last one of them
completely dried up!

00:03:20.455 --> 00:03:22.624
-(Gomamon gasping)
-(Joe gasping)

00:03:22.658 --> 00:03:24.293
You're kidding.

00:03:24.326 --> 00:03:25.894
[Kabukimon] Fear
not, my friends!

00:03:25.927 --> 00:03:27.562
There happens to be a glorious

00:03:27.596 --> 00:03:30.799
geyser within the mansion
where my lord resides.

00:03:30.832 --> 00:03:31.900
(group gasping)

00:03:31.933 --> 00:03:33.402
His what?

00:03:33.435 --> 00:03:35.737
This fellow could be our
ticket to steam town!

00:03:35.771 --> 00:03:36.738
(Kari gasping)

00:03:36.772 --> 00:03:38.807
Guess we kind of
lucked out, huh?

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:39.808
Right, then!

00:03:39.841 --> 00:03:42.077
We will gladly take
you up on your offer!

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:43.478
[Kabukimon] Magnificent!

00:03:43.512 --> 00:03:46.748
That's one hot spring
getaway for a party of six!

Kindly open the gates,

00:04:08.704 --> 00:04:13.275
sumptuous and most stunning
oasis of opulent delights!

00:04:13.308 --> 00:04:15.344

[Group] So cool!

00:04:20.816 --> 00:04:21.783
Impressive!

00:04:21.817 --> 00:04:23.652
It's gigantic!

00:04:23.685 --> 00:04:25.854
[Gomamon] Pretty epic, huh?

00:04:25.887 --> 00:04:27.489
(wood planks clicking)

00:04:27.522 --> 00:04:29.791
[Kabukimon] On
your knees, please!

00:04:29.825 --> 00:04:33.662
Presenting the magnanimous
master of Geko Hot Springs!

00:04:33.695 --> 00:04:35.130
Behold!

00:04:35.163 --> 00:04:39.901
Lord ShogunGekomon!

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:43.205
(ShogunGekomon chuckling)

00:04:43.238 --> 00:04:44.206
(group gasping)

00:04:44.239 --> 00:04:45.707
Put me in that hot spring!

00:04:45.741 --> 00:04:47.309
-(Joe giggling)
-Right behind ya!

00:04:47.342 --> 00:04:49.311
[Kabukimon] Hold your horses!

00:04:49.344 --> 00:04:50.312
Hey.

00:04:50.345 --> 00:04:51.480
What is it now?

00:04:51.513 --> 00:04:53.148
[Kabukimon] Step
away, you peasants!

00:04:53.181 --> 00:04:55.050
The water is off limits to lowly

00:04:55.083 --> 00:04:57.719
-(ShogunGekomon chuckling)
-commoners like yourselves!

00:04:57.753 --> 00:04:58.987
Really?

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.690
But didn't you say
you'd let us in?

00:05:01.723 --> 00:05:04.226
[Kabukimon] I said
there was a hot spring,

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:06.561
but I never said you
could bathe in it.

00:05:06.595 --> 00:05:10.031
(ShogunGekomon laughing)

00:05:12.067 --> 00:05:13.235
How come?

00:05:13.268 --> 00:05:15.003
There's lots of
room for everyone.

00:05:15.036 --> 00:05:16.004
[Kabukimon] This
hot spring is for

00:05:16.037 --> 00:05:17.873
my lord alone to enjoy and it's

00:05:17.906 --> 00:05:20.242
the only one left in this world.

00:05:20.275 --> 00:05:22.043
We wanted to keep
things exclusive,

00:05:22.077 --> 00:05:24.079
so we drained all the others.

00:05:24.112 --> 00:05:25.547
No way!

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.016
You mean those springs
disappeared because of you?

00:05:28.049 --> 00:05:30.852
(ShogunGekomon laughing)

00:05:30.886 --> 00:05:32.187
That's so selfish!

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.156
You'll never get away
with such cruelty!

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:36.425
[Kabukimon] Feel free to
prattle on as much as you like,

00:05:36.458 --> 00:05:38.960
but whatever my lordship
decides is absolute!

00:05:39.928 --> 00:05:41.363
I'm confused here.

00:05:41.396 --> 00:05:43.098
Why did you even
bother inviting us

00:05:43.131 --> 00:05:44.866
to the palace to begin with?

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.269
[Kabukimon] I'm glad you asked.

00:05:47.302 --> 00:05:49.704
(group yelling)

00:05:49.738 --> 00:05:52.107
How goes the tasting, my lord?

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:56.278
No!

00:05:56.311 --> 00:05:59.114
(ShogunGekomon giggling)

00:05:59.147 --> 00:06:02.083
(Gomamon growling)

00:06:03.118 --> 00:06:05.754
[ShogunGekomon] So soft!

00:06:05.787 --> 00:06:07.456
[Kabukimon] Very
keen of you, sir!

00:06:07.489 --> 00:06:09.458
-Excellent choice!
-Furry, warm, and huggable!

00:06:09.491 --> 00:06:11.092
[ShogunGekomon] You're
exactly my type.

00:06:11.126 --> 00:06:13.128
A soft and cozy bundle!

00:06:13.161 --> 00:06:15.630
What do you call
yourself little one?

00:06:15.664 --> 00:06:17.232
[Gomamon] I'm Gomamon!

00:06:17.265 --> 00:06:19.100
(Gomamon growling)

00:06:19.134 --> 00:06:20.769
[ShogunGekomon] Goma, is it?

00:06:20.802 --> 00:06:22.604
-(Gomamon growling)
-Ogoma!

00:06:22.637 --> 00:06:24.639
What an adorable moniker!

00:06:25.607 --> 00:06:26.908
Rejoice, my love!

00:06:26.942 --> 00:06:30.479
For it is you I've
chosen to marry!

00:06:30.512 --> 00:06:33.615
(ShogunGekomon laughing)

00:06:33.648 --> 00:06:34.916
Sorry, what?

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:36.418
Come again?

00:06:36.451 --> 00:06:37.752
[Group] Marry?

00:06:37.786 --> 00:06:40.288
(man yelling)

00:06:41.189 --> 00:06:43.592
Time out! We need to
back up for a sec!

00:06:43.625 --> 00:06:45.260
Are you saying what I
think you're saying?

00:06:45.293 --> 00:06:46.428
That's absurd!

00:06:46.461 --> 00:06:49.130
You can't force Gomamon
into marrying you!

00:06:49.164 --> 00:06:51.967
[Kabukimon] The most
luxuriously soft bride-to-be!

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.836
The most luxuriously
warm hot spring!

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:56.605
My lord now
possesses the perfect

00:06:56.638 --> 00:06:58.640
pairing of comfort and cozy!

00:06:58.673 --> 00:07:02.811
He's become the Ultimate
Cozy Hot Spring Shogun!

00:07:02.844 --> 00:07:04.012
Are you kidding?

00:07:04.045 --> 00:07:06.014
The both of them
are totally nuts!

00:07:06.047 --> 00:07:08.350
I think they must've
absorbed information

00:07:08.383 --> 00:07:09.451
from the human world,

00:07:09.484 --> 00:07:10.952
but some of it got scrambled.

00:07:10.986 --> 00:07:12.120
Hands off!

00:07:12.153 --> 00:07:13.488
Let me go already!

00:07:13.522 --> 00:07:15.457
Ultimate Shogun my butt!

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:17.025
(ShogunGekomon laughing)

00:07:17.058 --> 00:07:18.627
Gomamon!

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:21.196
[ShogunGekomon] Musical Fist!

00:07:23.231 --> 00:07:25.901
(group yelling)

00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:29.638
Hey!

00:07:29.671 --> 00:07:31.206
Don't leave me with this guy!

00:07:31.239 --> 00:07:32.407
[ShogunGekomon] Oh, Ogoma!

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:35.377
I think it's time we get to know
each other a little better.

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:36.378
Ew!

00:07:36.411 --> 00:07:37.646
No, I'm good!

00:07:37.679 --> 00:07:38.647
Please!

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:39.848
It's not you, it's me!

00:07:39.881 --> 00:07:43.068
[Kabukimon] Now enjoy
yourself, my lord.

00:07:47.239 --> 00:07:49.908
(Joe shivering)

00:07:50.976 --> 00:07:52.611
It's freezing!

00:07:52.644 --> 00:07:53.645
Over here!

00:07:54.579 --> 00:07:56.047
Are you okay?

00:07:56.081 --> 00:07:57.649
[Group] And pull!

00:07:59.317 --> 00:08:01.219
(Joe groaning)

00:08:01.253 --> 00:08:02.387
Thanks, guys.

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:04.256
Is everyone else good?

00:08:04.289 --> 00:08:05.457
We're okay.

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:07.559
Gomamon's still
kidnapped, though.

00:08:07.592 --> 00:08:08.560
No!

00:08:08.593 --> 00:08:09.594
I'll rescue them!

00:08:10.595 --> 00:08:12.731
(Joe groaning)

00:08:12.764 --> 00:08:14.900
Wait. I recognize that hair.

00:08:14.933 --> 00:08:16.234
Could it be?

00:08:16.268 --> 00:08:18.236
I'll handle this!

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:19.504
Lightning Paw!

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:26.578
[Joe] I knew it!

00:08:26.611 --> 00:08:27.579
Blossomon!

00:08:27.612 --> 00:08:29.314
And Nanimon!

00:08:29.347 --> 00:08:30.482
What's wrong?

00:08:30.515 --> 00:08:32.918
I was kind of
hoping for a fight.

00:08:32.951 --> 00:08:35.921
[Joe] Well, anyway,
long time no see.

00:08:35.954 --> 00:08:39.090
Have you been staying warm?

00:08:39.124 --> 00:08:40.592
Friends of yours?

00:08:40.625 --> 00:08:42.260
Actually, it's complicated.

00:08:42.294 --> 00:08:44.596
You could say we're
acquaintances.

00:08:44.629 --> 00:08:46.364
Or something along those lines.

00:08:47.799 --> 00:08:50.368
(wind howling)

00:08:51.536 --> 00:08:53.171
After the hot
springs disappeared,

00:08:53.204 --> 00:08:55.507
these Digimon had
nowhere else to go.

00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:57.108
I feel bad for them.

00:08:57.142 --> 00:08:59.344
-(Joe growling)
-(intense trumpet music)

00:08:59.377 --> 00:09:00.612
[Joe Voiceover]
Despite our scrapes,

00:09:00.645 --> 00:09:02.514
we did all share
the same bathwater.

00:09:02.547 --> 00:09:05.684
So Joe Kiddo is not about to
give them the cold shoulder.

00:09:05.717 --> 00:09:07.285
Not after everything
we've been through.

00:09:07.319 --> 00:09:08.520
It wouldn't be right!

00:09:09.988 --> 00:09:12.123
We'd better find a
way to warm up soon.

00:09:12.157 --> 00:09:13.792
Should we build a fire?

00:09:13.825 --> 00:09:16.561
Do you have anything we
could use for kindling, Joe?

00:09:17.562 --> 00:09:18.563
Joe?

00:09:20.999 --> 00:09:26.004
-(intense trumpet music)
-(Joe panting)

00:09:28.373 --> 00:09:29.841
[Gekomon] Geko!

00:09:31.876 --> 00:09:33.311
Give 'em back.

00:09:33.345 --> 00:09:35.714
Give everyone's
hot springs back!

00:09:36.915 --> 00:09:39.851
(Gekomon growling)

00:09:40.919 --> 00:09:43.989
(Joe yelling)

00:09:44.022 --> 00:09:45.223
(group gasping)

00:09:45.256 --> 00:09:47.325
(Joe yelling)

00:09:47.359 --> 00:09:49.828
[Junkmon] Safety first!

00:09:49.861 --> 00:09:51.162
(Joe yelling)

00:09:51.196 --> 00:09:52.864
Gotcha!

00:09:56.935 --> 00:09:58.670
That was great timing, Agumon.

00:09:58.703 --> 00:09:59.738
Thanks a lot.

00:09:59.771 --> 00:10:02.040
You are very welcome, Joe.

00:10:02.073 --> 00:10:03.508
[Tai] Nice catch there!

00:10:03.541 --> 00:10:06.745
-(Joe giggling)
-(Tai giggling)

00:10:06.778 --> 00:10:10.215
(ShogunGekomon laughing)

00:10:13.084 --> 00:10:15.186
[ShogunGekomon]
Oh, how delecable!

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:17.255
(ShogunGekomon laughing)

00:10:17.288 --> 00:10:19.024
(Gomamon growling)

00:10:19.057 --> 00:10:21.092
Let me go you weirdo!

00:10:21.126 --> 00:10:23.595
[ShogunGekomon] Still
haven't given up, have you?

00:10:23.628 --> 00:10:25.096
(Gomamon shivering)

00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:26.364
[ShogunGekomon] You
should forget about

00:10:26.398 --> 00:10:28.033
your little friends.

00:10:28.066 --> 00:10:30.368
I'm sure the
snowstorm has probably

00:10:30.402 --> 00:10:32.871
tuned them all into
ice sculptures!

00:10:32.904 --> 00:10:34.039
(Gomamon growling)

00:10:34.072 --> 00:10:36.107
You shouldn't
underestimate them!

00:10:36.141 --> 00:10:37.609
(ShogunGekomon laughing)

00:10:37.642 --> 00:10:39.711
[ShogunGekomon] I love
that hot temper of yours.

00:10:39.744 --> 00:10:42.614
You just might make
the bath boil over!

00:10:42.647 --> 00:10:43.882
Oh my, are you scared?

00:10:44.883 --> 00:10:46.551
Oh, you're so cute
when you shiver.

00:10:46.584 --> 00:10:48.453
[Gomamon Voiceover] The
others might be in trouble.

00:10:48.486 --> 00:10:49.921
I've gotta think
of something quick

00:10:49.954 --> 00:10:51.423
so I can make my escape.

00:10:52.824 --> 00:10:53.958
Nah, I'm not scared.

00:10:53.992 --> 00:10:55.126
I'm excited!

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.562
-[ShogunGekomon] Oh yes.
-(Gomamon groaning)

00:10:57.595 --> 00:10:58.963
[Gomamon Voiceover] This
guy doesn't give up,

00:10:58.997 --> 00:11:00.632
and neither will I!

00:11:00.665 --> 00:11:02.400
I think I'm all caught up now.

00:11:02.434 --> 00:11:04.469
Sounds like sneaking
into ShogunGekomon's

00:11:04.502 --> 00:11:06.771
love nest is gonna be
tougher than we thought.

00:11:06.805 --> 00:11:08.740
The Gekomon's
defenses are so solid,

00:11:08.773 --> 00:11:10.809
they're practically
a living blockade.

00:11:10.842 --> 00:11:12.944
Then we charge through
it paws-a-blazing!

00:11:12.977 --> 00:11:13.945
Yeah.

00:11:13.978 --> 00:11:15.146
Like ka-pow!

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:17.148
Isn't that a bit
reckless, though?

00:11:17.182 --> 00:11:19.617
We might end up demolishing
the whole place.

00:11:19.651 --> 00:11:21.086
Worst case scenario,

00:11:21.119 --> 00:11:23.988
the walls collapse and
Gomamon is trapped inside.

00:11:24.022 --> 00:11:25.156
(Joe growling)

00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:27.325
-(group gasping)
-Why bother charging in?

00:11:27.358 --> 00:11:30.095
We could simply
lure them outside.

00:11:30.128 --> 00:11:31.496
That's a great idea!

00:11:32.664 --> 00:11:34.632
Well, we still
need to figure out

00:11:34.666 --> 00:11:36.668
what we're baiting them with.

00:11:36.701 --> 00:11:40.338
(suspenseful violin music)

00:11:40.371 --> 00:11:42.307
I've got the perfect solution!

00:11:44.642 --> 00:11:46.277
(bells ringing)

00:11:46.311 --> 00:11:49.447
-(Gomamon groaning)
-(playful piano music)

00:11:49.481 --> 00:11:52.350
[ShogunGekomon] Round and
round and round you go!

00:11:52.383 --> 00:11:54.853
You're making me dizzy.

00:11:54.886 --> 00:11:56.121
(ShogunGekomon giggling)

00:11:56.154 --> 00:11:58.790
[ShogunGekomon] You put
the hot in hot springs!

00:11:58.823 --> 00:12:02.093
(Gomamon growling)

00:12:02.127 --> 00:12:03.094
(Gomamon groaning)

00:12:03.128 --> 00:12:04.529
[Gomamon Voiceover]
The heat is starting

00:12:04.562 --> 00:12:05.797
to make me lose it!

00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:08.533
At this rate, I'm never
gonna get out of here!

00:12:08.566 --> 00:12:10.301
(loud explosions)

00:12:10.335 --> 00:12:11.536
-(Gomamon gasping)
-(ShogunGekomon gasping)

00:12:11.569 --> 00:12:13.371
[Kabukimon] Pardon
the intrusion, sir!

00:12:13.404 --> 00:12:14.539
(Kabukimon gargling)

00:12:14.572 --> 00:12:16.341
[ShogunGekomon]
This better be good.

00:12:17.008 --> 00:12:17.976
[Kabukimon] My Lord!

00:12:18.009 --> 00:12:18.977
I'm sorry.

00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:20.545
But there's an emergency!

00:12:20.578 --> 00:12:21.813
(wood planks clicking)

00:12:21.846 --> 00:12:23.715
Bombs away!

00:12:23.748 --> 00:12:25.316
Here, have another!

00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:27.051
(bombs exploding)

00:12:27.085 --> 00:12:29.154
Step right up, everyone!

00:12:29.187 --> 00:12:30.655
You're in for a treat.

00:12:30.688 --> 00:12:32.824
Beat the cold and
support your local bath!

00:12:32.857 --> 00:12:33.825
Come on!

00:12:33.858 --> 00:12:35.393
Don't be shy!

00:12:35.426 --> 00:12:37.495
The water sure is
nice and steamy!

00:12:37.529 --> 00:12:38.730
Don't miss out!

00:12:38.763 --> 00:12:40.398
[Group] Splish, splish, splash!

00:12:40.431 --> 00:12:41.866
Come enjoy the bath!

00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:43.868
Splish, splish, splash!

00:12:43.902 --> 00:12:45.570
[Kabukimon] It seems
a new spring has

00:12:45.603 --> 00:12:47.238
emerged from the frost!

00:12:47.272 --> 00:12:49.073
[ShogunGekomon] How dare they!

00:12:49.107 --> 00:12:50.708
They'll pay for this misdeed!

00:12:50.742 --> 00:12:54.012
I shall personally drain
every last hot spring,

00:12:54.045 --> 00:12:55.380
except my own!

00:12:55.413 --> 00:12:57.248
Prepare the carriage!

00:12:57.282 --> 00:13:00.785
(intense orchestra music)

00:13:04.455 --> 00:13:06.424
Why are you filling
that giant tub?

00:13:06.457 --> 00:13:08.259
[Kabukimon] Our lordship
exerts the most power

00:13:08.293 --> 00:13:11.196
when submerged within
a cozy vat of H20.

00:13:11.229 --> 00:13:13.698
So he must stay that way,
even while traveling.

00:13:13.731 --> 00:13:15.099
Now, let us depart!

00:13:15.133 --> 00:13:18.503
(ShogunGekomon growling)

00:13:18.536 --> 00:13:20.405
[ShogunGekomon] As soon as
I step out of the water,

00:13:20.438 --> 00:13:22.240
I go cold and clammy!

00:13:23.441 --> 00:13:24.409
(splash)

00:13:24.442 --> 00:13:27.078
(ShogunGekomon sighing)

00:13:27.111 --> 00:13:28.379
Much better.

00:13:28.413 --> 00:13:31.382
I'm at my best when I'm
cozy and warm and wet.

00:13:31.416 --> 00:13:33.952
(ShogunGekomon laughing)

00:13:33.985 --> 00:13:36.087
[Kabukimon] Now
march, you drumskulls!

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:39.157
(intense drum music)

00:13:41.826 --> 00:13:44.229
Hook, line, and sinker, guys!

00:13:44.262 --> 00:13:45.897
Get ready!
Here they come!

00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:48.266
Woo hoo!

00:13:48.299 --> 00:13:49.968
Everything's going
according to plan.

00:13:50.001 --> 00:13:51.169
Yeah.

00:13:51.202 --> 00:13:53.438
I figured they wouldn't be
able to resist drying us out.

00:13:53.471 --> 00:13:54.439
Okay!

00:13:54.472 --> 00:13:55.807
Brace yourselves, folks!

00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:56.841
[Group] Okidokie!

00:13:58.009 --> 00:13:59.477
[Joe Voiceover] Hang
in there, Gomamon.

00:13:59.510 --> 00:14:00.979
I swear I'll save you!

00:14:01.012 --> 00:14:03.147
(ShogunGekomon laughing)

00:14:03.181 --> 00:14:05.083
[ShogunGekomon]
Steam ahead, boys!

00:14:05.116 --> 00:14:07.819
-(ShogunGekomon laughing)
-(Gomamon gasping)

00:14:07.852 --> 00:14:09.821
Hey, my all powerful lord.

00:14:09.854 --> 00:14:12.924
I really wanna try that
new hot spring right now.

00:14:12.957 --> 00:14:14.592
Pretty please?

00:14:14.626 --> 00:14:15.760
(ShogunGekomon squealing)

00:14:15.793 --> 00:14:17.595
[ShogunGekomon] So cute!

00:14:17.629 --> 00:14:19.998
Humana, humana, humana, hoom!

00:14:21.132 --> 00:14:22.600
[Kabukimon] Wait, my lord!

00:14:22.634 --> 00:14:23.635
You mustn't!

00:14:23.668 --> 00:14:25.270
[ShogunGekomon] Ho-ho!

-(Joe gasping)
-(Tai gasping)

00:14:27.872 --> 00:14:29.941
(splash)

00:14:29.974 --> 00:14:31.442
(group gasping)

00:14:31.476 --> 00:14:34.512
I suppose he didn't need
very much convincing, huh?

00:14:34.545 --> 00:14:35.947
(ShogunGekomon chuckling)

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:37.649
[ShogunGekomon] It's
bit tepid in here.

00:14:37.682 --> 00:14:40.018
What do you think,
Ogoma my dear?

00:14:40.051 --> 00:14:41.052
What?

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:44.522
(ShogunGekomon
blowing a raspberry)

00:14:44.555 --> 00:14:47.492
Where has my demur
darling run off to?

00:14:50.662 --> 00:14:51.963
Gadzooks!

00:14:51.996 --> 00:14:54.699
Where did these
savages come from?

00:14:57.235 --> 00:14:58.369
Hey, Joe!

00:14:58.403 --> 00:14:59.537
Gomamon!

00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:01.572
[ShogunGekomon] Ogoma!

00:15:05.843 --> 00:15:06.978
I missed you, buddy!

00:15:07.011 --> 00:15:08.513
I missed you too!

00:15:09.414 --> 00:15:12.317
I saw the fireworks and I
knew it was you right away!

00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:13.318
Thanks, friends!

00:15:13.351 --> 00:15:15.486
Glad our old bath buds helped.

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:16.988
Joe's rescue plan worked!

00:15:17.021 --> 00:15:19.023
We're glad to have
you back, Gomamon.

00:15:19.057 --> 00:15:20.224
Now let's clean up.

00:15:20.258 --> 00:15:20.733
Yeah!

00:15:24.278 --> 00:15:26.981
[Kabukimon] Faster,
you nincompoops!

00:15:27.015 --> 00:15:28.149
Can I help you?

00:15:28.182 --> 00:15:30.284
[Greymon] Bathing
hours are over, chumps!

00:15:30.318 --> 00:15:31.753
You'll wish you washed at home

00:15:31.786 --> 00:15:32.987
once we're through with you!

00:15:33.021 --> 00:15:34.922
[Kabukimon] Why you little...

00:15:34.956 --> 00:15:35.990
To arms!

00:15:36.024 --> 00:15:37.258
Attack them!

00:15:37.291 --> 00:15:38.593
-(Gekomon yelling)
-[Greymon] Nova Blast!

00:15:39.193 --> 00:15:40.628
(Gekomon yelling)

00:15:40.661 --> 00:15:41.796
(Kabukimon growling)

00:15:41.829 --> 00:15:44.298
Then I'll have to
strike you down myself!

00:15:44.332 --> 00:15:46.801
Wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee!

00:15:48.336 --> 00:15:50.671
[ShogunGekomon] How
could you, Ogoma?

00:15:50.705 --> 00:15:51.939
That isn't my name!

00:15:51.973 --> 00:15:53.107
It's Gomamon, dummy!

00:15:53.141 --> 00:15:55.276
And my partner
will always be Joe!

00:15:55.309 --> 00:15:56.978
Listen up, you big bully!

00:15:57.011 --> 00:15:58.312
All the water you stole?

00:15:58.346 --> 00:15:59.847
You're gonna give it back!

00:15:59.881 --> 00:16:01.449
(suspenseful music)

00:16:01.482 --> 00:16:04.318
[Gomamon] Gomamon, digivolve to!

00:16:07.722 --> 00:16:09.791
(Ikkakumon roaring)

00:16:09.824 --> 00:16:11.859
[Ikkakumon] Ikkakumon!

00:16:11.893 --> 00:16:14.162
(ShogunGekomon gasping)

00:16:14.195 --> 00:16:15.930
[Ikkakumon] ShogunGekomon
draws his power

00:16:15.963 --> 00:16:16.931
from hot springs.

00:16:16.964 --> 00:16:18.366
So that's why he's always trying

00:16:18.399 --> 00:16:20.134
to keep himself sopping.

00:16:20.168 --> 00:16:22.036
[Ikkakumon] But the
temperature's important, too.

00:16:22.070 --> 00:16:24.872
He's weak to the cold and
can't move outside the bath.

00:16:24.906 --> 00:16:25.873
[Joe] Oh yeah?

00:16:25.907 --> 00:16:27.208
Then we should drag
him outta there and-

00:16:27.241 --> 00:16:30.678
(ShogunGekomon laughing)

00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:33.681
[ShogunGekomon] Yes.

00:16:33.714 --> 00:16:35.149
It's you.

00:16:35.183 --> 00:16:38.219
The bride of my dreams!

00:16:38.252 --> 00:16:39.720
(Ikkakumon gasping)

00:16:39.754 --> 00:16:42.990
-(Ikkakumon yelling)
-(Joe yelling)

00:16:43.024 --> 00:16:45.159
[ShogunGekomon] Nothing's
gonna get in the way

00:16:45.193 --> 00:16:48.396
of our love this
time, buttercup.

00:16:48.429 --> 00:16:50.698
[Kabukimon] Wedge Attack!

00:16:50.731 --> 00:16:54.669
-(metal banging)
-(Greymon growling)

00:16:54.702 --> 00:16:57.772
(fireball exploding)

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:02.110
(Ikkakumon growling)

00:17:04.579 --> 00:17:07.915
-(Ikkakumon growling)
-(Joe growling)

00:17:07.949 --> 00:17:11.385
[ShogunGekomon Voiceover]
I'm the Ultimate Cozy Shogun!

00:17:11.419 --> 00:17:13.221
Submit to me!

00:17:13.254 --> 00:17:15.089
-(group gasping)
-Ikkakumon, you can't!

00:17:15.123 --> 00:17:17.024
Don't let him kiss you!

00:17:17.058 --> 00:17:19.227
[ShogunGekomon Voiceover]
Embrace the moment!

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:20.695
As long as he's
still in that bath,

00:17:20.728 --> 00:17:22.396
the rest of us are in hot water!

00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:23.531
[Ikkakumon] Good one, Joe.

00:17:23.564 --> 00:17:24.532
How do we change that?

00:17:24.565 --> 00:17:25.900
Oh wait.

00:17:25.933 --> 00:17:27.902
Actually, he should
stay right where he is.

00:17:27.935 --> 00:17:28.936
Hey, Ikkakumon!

00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:30.771
Aim for that point over there!

00:17:30.805 --> 00:17:31.772
[Ikkakumon] On it!

00:17:31.806 --> 00:17:33.074
Harpoon Torpedo!

00:17:34.275 --> 00:17:37.278
(torpedo exploding)

00:17:39.147 --> 00:17:40.114
[ShogunGekomon] No!

00:17:40.148 --> 00:17:41.282
Gadzooks!

00:17:41.315 --> 00:17:43.885
The spring is
starting to freeze!

00:17:43.918 --> 00:17:45.720
I need hot water!

00:17:45.753 --> 00:17:46.721
[Joe] Sorry.

00:17:46.754 --> 00:17:48.422
You're just gonna have
to deal, your lordship.

00:17:48.456 --> 00:17:49.423
[ShogunGekomon] Say what?

00:17:49.457 --> 00:17:50.958
You heard me.

00:17:50.992 --> 00:17:52.560
This is a fake
hot spring we made

00:17:52.593 --> 00:17:53.895
to draw you out here.

00:17:53.928 --> 00:17:56.230
You're sitting in
a common puddle.

00:17:56.264 --> 00:17:59.133
(victorious music)

00:18:00.434 --> 00:18:02.069
It won't heat up again.

00:18:02.103 --> 00:18:04.472
Once it chills all the
way down, you're done for!

00:18:04.505 --> 00:18:06.474
[ShogunGekomon] That's cold!

00:18:06.507 --> 00:18:07.575
Hurry, everyone!

00:18:07.608 --> 00:18:09.477
Shovel in as much
snow as you can!

00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:11.245
[Junkmon] That's it!
Keep it moving!

00:18:11.279 --> 00:18:12.246
Let's go, let's go!

(ShogunGekomon yelling)

00:18:18.519 --> 00:18:21.956
[ShogunGekomon] I'm as
limp as a wet noodle.

00:18:21.989 --> 00:18:23.357
Enough smooching for you!

00:18:26.327 --> 00:18:29.931
[Ikkakumon] Ikkakumon
digivolve to!

00:18:29.964 --> 00:18:32.967
(upbeat rock music)

[Zudomon] Zudomon!

00:18:41.509 --> 00:18:44.812
(upbeat rock music)

00:18:44.845 --> 00:18:46.113
[ShogunGekomon] What happened?

00:18:46.147 --> 00:18:48.049
You used to be so
much more cuddly.

00:18:48.883 --> 00:18:50.151
[Zudomon] You washed my back,

00:18:50.184 --> 00:18:52.620
so I'm washing yours!

00:18:52.653 --> 00:18:57.658
-(upbeat rock music)
-(ShogunGekomon yelling)

00:18:58.392 --> 00:19:00.027
[ShogunGekomon] You
call this a puddle?

00:19:00.061 --> 00:19:02.063
It's practically an ice bath!

00:19:03.397 --> 00:19:05.233
[Tai] It's our turn!

00:19:08.502 --> 00:19:11.672
[Greymon] Greymon digivolve to!

00:19:11.706 --> 00:19:14.709
(upbeat rock music)

[MetalGreymon] MetalGreymon!

00:19:22.583 --> 00:19:24.652
[Tai] Time to let loose, pal!

[Kabukimon] What the?

00:19:35.696 --> 00:19:37.064
[Gekomon] Geko!

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:40.101
Geko!

(Kabukimon yelling)

[Kabukimon] My lord!

-(ShogunGekomon shivering)
-(Kabukimon shivering)

00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:53.948
[Zudomon] Ahem!

00:19:55.449 --> 00:19:56.417
[ShogunGekomon] Wait!

00:19:56.450 --> 00:19:57.852
Let's talk about this.

00:19:57.885 --> 00:19:59.186
How 'bout I grant
you half of the

00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:00.354
palace's hot spring water?

00:20:00.388 --> 00:20:02.223
That's a fair deal, right?

00:20:03.391 --> 00:20:05.559
But that water's
for everyone to use.

00:20:05.593 --> 00:20:07.261
A hot spring is a communal place

00:20:07.295 --> 00:20:09.597
for all to comfort
their bodies and souls.

00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:10.631
It's sacred!

00:20:11.632 --> 00:20:13.067
[Zudomon] You've
been soaking in your

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:16.237

for way too long!

-(Kabukimon yelling)
-(ShogunGekomon yelling)

(ShogunGekomon groaning)

00:20:25.479 --> 00:20:26.447
Hah!

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:27.782
Time to dry off!

00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:30.551
Bravo!

00:20:30.584 --> 00:20:32.219
[Group] Amazing!

00:20:32.253 --> 00:20:34.388
(bright piano music)

00:20:34.422 --> 00:20:37.058
[Zudomon] Well, I
had a lot of help.

00:20:37.091 --> 00:20:38.292
[Joe] Thanks a lot!

00:20:40.995 --> 00:20:44.632
(bright trumpet music)

00:20:44.665 --> 00:20:46.567
How is it? You like it?

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:48.069
Uh huh. It feels nice.

00:20:48.102 --> 00:20:49.070
It does.

00:20:49.103 --> 00:20:50.137
I could soak forever.

00:20:50.171 --> 00:20:51.238
Well, it looks comfy.

00:20:51.272 --> 00:20:52.640
Maybe I'll hop in.

00:20:52.673 --> 00:20:54.809
(group sighing)

00:20:54.842 --> 00:20:56.143
Hey, you guys.

00:20:57.445 --> 00:20:59.814
Still plenty of
room in the bath.

00:20:59.847 --> 00:21:00.815
[ShogunGekomon] Wait.

00:21:00.848 --> 00:21:02.083
Really?

00:21:02.116 --> 00:21:04.585
Are you saying you'd
let us bathe here too?

00:21:04.618 --> 00:21:05.753
Did you forget?

00:21:05.786 --> 00:21:07.988
I said that hot
springs are for all.

00:21:08.022 --> 00:21:09.590
[ShogunGekomon] Thank you!

00:21:09.623 --> 00:21:11.625
You're a lord among lords, sir!

00:21:11.659 --> 00:21:12.927
Wait, for real?

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:13.928
Little old me?

00:21:13.961 --> 00:21:15.162
Yeah!

00:21:15.196 --> 00:21:17.131
Be the lord you
were meant to be.

00:21:17.164 --> 00:21:19.500
Not sure I wanna do that.

00:21:19.533 --> 00:21:20.801
Hey, enough chit-chat.

00:21:20.835 --> 00:21:22.603
Let's hurry up and
get to relaxing.

00:21:22.636 --> 00:21:23.871

00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:32.279
Nothing better than
winding down with friends.

(Joe chuckling)

00:21:33.547 --> 00:21:35.483

sure are the best.
