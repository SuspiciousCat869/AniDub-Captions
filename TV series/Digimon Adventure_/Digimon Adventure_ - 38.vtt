[Narrator] This is
the mysterious world

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.761
where Digimon live,
the Digital World.

00:01:45.794 --> 00:01:48.163
Tai Kamiya and the
other Digi-destined,

00:01:48.196 --> 00:01:50.165
along with their
Digimon partners

00:01:50.198 --> 00:01:53.835
continue their quest to stop
the return of Millenniummon,

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:55.804
while also trying
to find and gather

00:01:55.837 --> 00:01:58.473
the rest of their
scattered friends.

00:01:58.507 --> 00:02:01.944
Meanwhile, Matt and Gabumon
were also on the move

00:02:01.977 --> 00:02:04.947
and on their way to
rejoin the others.

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.015
However, as they traveled,

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.452
they happened to pass some
strange rock formations

00:02:10.485 --> 00:02:12.521
where a group of
manipulated Digimon

00:02:12.554 --> 00:02:14.222
were mysteriously lurking.

00:02:16.058 --> 00:02:19.194
Great danger was
closing in on Gabumon.

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.000
[Mephistomon] El
sabas millennia.

00:02:25.033 --> 00:02:26.668
El sabas millennia.

00:02:28.337 --> 00:02:29.905
El sabas millennia.

00:02:31.573 --> 00:02:33.175
El sabas millennia.

00:02:36.378 --> 00:02:37.546

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:40.582

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:21.857
(Joe and Gomamon
painfully moaning)

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:23.925
Gomamon, you okay?

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:25.394
(Joe sneezing)

00:03:25.427 --> 00:03:26.395
It's cold.

00:03:26.428 --> 00:03:27.696
What happened to my clothes?

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:29.364
They were in my bag.

00:03:29.398 --> 00:03:30.365
[Matt] You mean this?

00:03:30.399 --> 00:03:34.036
Huh? Oh nice, my bag!

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:36.138
[Joe and Gomamon] Matt!

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.075
Joe, forgetting something?

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:44.079
[Joe] We were trapped by a
bunch of roughneck Digimon

00:03:44.112 --> 00:03:45.447
at the hot springs.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.715
We were going crazy

00:03:46.748 --> 00:03:49.151
trying to find some way
to get out of there.

00:03:50.252 --> 00:03:53.088
But luckily, we found a rock
that was plugging a hole

00:03:53.121 --> 00:03:54.389
at the bottom of the hot springs

00:03:54.423 --> 00:03:56.458
and keeping the water
from running out.

00:03:56.491 --> 00:03:59.161
And when we shoved
it to the side,

00:04:01.463 --> 00:04:04.232
we got swept out through the
hole, along with the water.

00:04:04.266 --> 00:04:05.434
I'm glad you're here.

00:04:06.501 --> 00:04:07.502
Huh?

00:04:08.503 --> 00:04:12.240
(suspenseful music)

00:04:12.274 --> 00:04:14.309
[Gomamon] Gabumon was captured?

00:04:14.342 --> 00:04:19.347
[Matt] Yeah, by a Digimon
called Mephistomon.

00:04:22.117 --> 00:04:23.852
El sabas millennia.

00:04:25.353 --> 00:04:26.955
El sabas millennia.

00:04:28.957 --> 00:04:31.093
El sabas millennia.

00:04:31.126 --> 00:04:33.095
[Troopman] El sabas millennia.

00:04:33.128 --> 00:04:36.598
[Mephistomon] El
sabas millennia.

00:04:36.631 --> 00:04:38.166
El sabas millennia.

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:42.003
El sabas millennia.

00:04:43.472 --> 00:04:44.506
(Elecmon yelling)

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:46.174
El sabas millennia.

00:04:47.809 --> 00:04:49.377
El sabas millennia.

00:04:51.847 --> 00:04:53.482
El sabas millennia.

00:04:55.817 --> 00:04:58.820
(suspenseful music)

00:05:01.556 --> 00:05:03.825
[Matt] Mephistomon sucks
the energy from Digimon

00:05:03.859 --> 00:05:07.362
with an evil spell and then
sends it to a black crystal.

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.132
[Gomamon] A black crystal?

00:05:10.165 --> 00:05:11.666
Isn't that-

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.236
[Joe] One of those shards
of that Millenniummon guy?

00:05:15.403 --> 00:05:16.872
So you're saying that thing

00:05:16.905 --> 00:05:20.208
is a piece of an ancient
deadly Digimon's body,

00:05:20.242 --> 00:05:22.144
like in Tai's story?

00:05:22.177 --> 00:05:23.845
Sure seems that way.

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:26.515
It looks like it's being
used as part of a ritual

00:05:26.548 --> 00:05:28.950
where they offer up
living sacrifices.

00:05:28.984 --> 00:05:30.152
Can't say I've ever seen

00:05:30.185 --> 00:05:32.187
the point of that
kind of thing myself.

00:05:37.058 --> 00:05:39.027
I can't just ignore this.

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.197
I have to, I have to save them!

00:05:44.432 --> 00:05:47.936
We decided we had to
act so we went in, but-

00:05:48.904 --> 00:05:51.740
(lasers blasting)

00:05:56.378 --> 00:05:57.612
We got separated.

00:05:59.614 --> 00:06:00.615
Garurumon!

00:06:01.783 --> 00:06:04.419
Matt, take care
of those Digimon!

00:06:04.452 --> 00:06:05.453
Garurumon!

00:06:12.727 --> 00:06:13.862
Joe.

00:06:13.895 --> 00:06:15.096
Huh?

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:16.264
[Matt] Gomamon.

00:06:16.298 --> 00:06:17.265
Hmm?

00:06:17.299 --> 00:06:19.467
I can't reach the
very top on my own.

00:06:21.136 --> 00:06:24.439
That's why I need you
to lend me a hand.

00:06:25.574 --> 00:06:26.575
Please.

00:06:29.144 --> 00:06:30.745
-Of course!
-You bet!

00:06:32.981 --> 00:06:35.116
Gee, I never imagined
there would come a day

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:37.419
when you'd ask me for help.

00:06:37.452 --> 00:06:40.922
Whatever you need, Matt,
you just leave it to us.

00:06:42.791 --> 00:06:45.627
(mysterious music)

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:50.665
I guess my number's up.

00:06:56.605 --> 00:06:58.240
(explosions booming)

00:06:58.273 --> 00:06:59.774
Harpoon Torpedo!

00:07:00.675 --> 00:07:03.612
(missiles roaring)

00:07:16.291 --> 00:07:21.304
(explosions booming)

00:07:36.594 --> 00:07:39.030
[Tai] When we all got separated
after reaching this continent,

00:07:39.798 --> 00:07:42.934
I was worried we might
never find each other again.

00:07:42.968 --> 00:07:45.003
But now, even after
everything that's happened,

00:07:45.036 --> 00:07:46.638
we're only missing Joe and Matt.

00:07:49.474 --> 00:07:53.311
I just wonder if Matt and
Gabumon are still all right.

00:07:53.345 --> 00:07:55.613
Oh, I bet they're just fine.

00:07:55.647 --> 00:07:57.515
After all, those two have
been working together

00:07:57.549 --> 00:08:00.819
for a long time, even
since before I met Agumon.

00:08:00.852 --> 00:08:02.287
You're right, they have.

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:04.122
I wonder exactly how long.

00:08:04.155 --> 00:08:06.057
Do you have any idea, TK?

00:08:07.659 --> 00:08:09.027
Because Matt and me,

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:11.663
we've been living apart
for a long time now.

00:08:13.164 --> 00:08:15.800
Our mommy and daddy
got into a big fight

00:08:15.834 --> 00:08:17.802
and they were away at
work a lot of the time,

00:08:17.836 --> 00:08:20.705
so neither of them was
ever home much anyway.

00:08:20.739 --> 00:08:23.675
So then one day, I went
to live with mommy,

00:08:23.708 --> 00:08:25.577
and Matt went to
live with daddy.

00:08:26.544 --> 00:08:28.546
But it isn't like I
never got to see him.

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:31.683
He always kept in touch
and he came to visit a lot.

00:08:31.716 --> 00:08:34.886
Oh, wow. I never
knew all that.

00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:37.722
Okay, which one of you
guys took my grapes?

00:08:37.756 --> 00:08:38.723
(Tai laughing)

00:08:38.757 --> 00:08:39.758
Loving the new look.

00:08:43.762 --> 00:08:45.864
Yeah, now that I think about it,

00:08:47.699 --> 00:08:49.501
Matt and Gabumon I mean.

00:08:49.534 --> 00:08:50.769
How did they meet?

00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:13.792
[Tsunomon] Matt!

00:09:16.061 --> 00:09:18.129
[Matt] It all came
at me so suddenly,

00:09:19.097 --> 00:09:20.965
a world I'd never seen before

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:25.403
and a strange creature
that called me by my name.

00:09:27.972 --> 00:09:31.276
Enough with all this Digimon
and Network crisis stuff.

00:09:31.309 --> 00:09:33.445
I don't have time to
even listen to this,

00:09:33.478 --> 00:09:34.946
let alone get involved.

00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:37.682
You're just gonna have
to find somebody else.

00:09:37.715 --> 00:09:39.884
Come on, Matt, don't leave.

00:09:39.918 --> 00:09:42.153
How do I even get outta here?

00:09:44.756 --> 00:09:46.057
Stop following me.

00:09:46.091 --> 00:09:49.394
I'm not following you,
I'm protecting you.

00:09:49.427 --> 00:09:51.062
That's okay, isn't it?

00:09:51.096 --> 00:09:52.063
(Matt sighing)

00:09:52.097 --> 00:09:54.666
(gentle music)

00:10:06.611 --> 00:10:08.480
Hey, I told you
not to follow me.

00:10:08.513 --> 00:10:11.449
It just so happens I have
business this way too.

00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:14.953
(Matt sighing)

00:10:23.361 --> 00:10:24.863
[Matt] And then-

00:10:31.469 --> 00:10:34.305
(Tsunomon yelling)

00:10:37.041 --> 00:10:39.377
Tsunomon really did protect me.

00:10:42.313 --> 00:10:44.349
Hey, are you okay, little guy?

00:10:44.382 --> 00:10:45.450
Matt!

00:10:45.483 --> 00:10:47.152
You gotta get out of here!

00:10:50.221 --> 00:10:53.057
(lasers blasting)

00:11:00.832 --> 00:11:01.833
Matt.

00:11:03.067 --> 00:11:05.737
(Matt grunting)

00:11:12.577 --> 00:11:15.180
(Matt yelling)

00:11:40.271 --> 00:11:42.874
Okay, so what's
your story anyway?

00:11:44.075 --> 00:11:47.378
Matt, you, you risked
your life to protect me.

00:11:49.447 --> 00:11:52.383
You could have just run
off and left me there.

00:11:52.417 --> 00:11:53.418
Well, uh-

(Gabumon laughing)

00:12:02.393 --> 00:12:04.295

These guys must be taking
their orders from that spell.

00:13:11.362 --> 00:13:13.164
I'm losing control!

00:13:15.533 --> 00:13:16.634
Don't listen!

00:13:16.668 --> 00:13:18.269
Don't listen to it!

00:13:18.303 --> 00:13:19.304
No use!

00:13:19.337 --> 00:13:21.706

"As the temple bells

You gave me something
I'd never had before!

Huh?
