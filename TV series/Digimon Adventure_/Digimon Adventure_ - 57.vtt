[Narrator] Guided by the
power of the eight crests,

00:01:42.712 --> 00:01:45.615
a new chapter of the
Digi-Destined's great adventure

00:01:45.648 --> 00:01:46.649
had begun.

00:01:47.517 --> 00:01:49.652
Who knows what trials
and tribulations

00:01:49.686 --> 00:01:50.853
they'll need to face

00:01:50.887 --> 00:01:53.856
in their fight against
the Great Catastrophe?

00:01:56.225 --> 00:01:58.194
Although the Digi-Destined
have started

00:01:58.227 --> 00:01:59.829
to light their crests.

00:01:59.862 --> 00:02:02.832
They have yet to grasp the
nature of the Great Catastrophe

00:02:02.865 --> 00:02:05.168
that is now approaching
the Digital World.

00:02:10.406 --> 00:02:13.376
Tai and Agumon continue
on their journey,

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:15.178
guided by their Digivice.

00:02:18.681 --> 00:02:21.250
(gentle music)

00:02:24.887 --> 00:02:27.390
Hey, hey. I'm glad to hear
you're feeling better Patamon.

00:02:27.423 --> 00:02:30.393
I am, thanks to the hot springs.

00:02:30.426 --> 00:02:33.663
Yeah, so we should be heading
out of here pretty soon too.

00:02:33.696 --> 00:02:36.032
But, Gatomon is...

00:02:36.065 --> 00:02:37.500
Yeah? What's the matter?

00:02:37.533 --> 00:02:39.068
Uh...

00:02:39.102 --> 00:02:41.437
I'll get out right
after I count to 20.

00:02:42.538 --> 00:02:44.907
1, 2, 3...

00:02:44.941 --> 00:02:48.344
Guess Gatomon really
likes the hot spring.

00:02:48.378 --> 00:02:50.880
No one can resist
the Kido Hot Springs,

00:02:50.913 --> 00:02:52.915
not even the celestial Digimon.

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:55.752
Yeah, come on. You gotta try it.

00:02:55.785 --> 00:02:59.188
We'll be on our way as
soon as Gatomon gets out.

00:02:59.222 --> 00:03:01.391
Okay then. You be careful.

00:03:01.424 --> 00:03:03.192
We'll see you guys later.

00:03:03.226 --> 00:03:04.193
Hmm.

00:03:04.227 --> 00:03:05.528
Bye bye.

00:03:05.561 --> 00:03:07.063
Ready Gatomon?

00:03:07.096 --> 00:03:08.431
Yeah.

00:03:08.464 --> 00:03:10.400
As soon as I count to 30.

00:03:13.803 --> 00:03:16.406
So Tai, are you two
holding up okay?

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:18.107
Yeah. Feeling great.

00:03:18.141 --> 00:03:19.909
[Tentomon] Fortunately
Wisemon's research team

00:03:19.942 --> 00:03:21.377
happened to be in your area,

00:03:21.411 --> 00:03:23.446
so we asked if they
could pick you guys up.

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:25.648
And, as you see, they did.

00:03:27.784 --> 00:03:29.786
(Honeybeemon giggles)

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:31.387
Well thanks for doing that.

00:03:31.421 --> 00:03:32.889
We owe you one.

00:03:32.922 --> 00:03:34.023
So what's up Izzy?

00:03:34.057 --> 00:03:35.458
How are things on your end?

00:03:35.491 --> 00:03:38.628
Fine. We've made a lot of
progress on the data recovery.

00:03:38.661 --> 00:03:41.464
So we should be able to head
out of here pretty soon too.

00:03:41.497 --> 00:03:42.498
Sounds good.

00:03:43.766 --> 00:03:46.235
But about the Great
Catastrophe Wisemon predicted?

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:49.272
When this event will actually
occur is still a mystery.

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.608
And what's going to
happen when it does?

00:03:52.642 --> 00:03:55.378
We don't know yet. We
don't know anything yet.

00:03:55.411 --> 00:03:58.548
For now, all we can do is follow
the directions on our Digivices

00:03:58.581 --> 00:04:01.417
because basically those are the
only clues we have to go on.

00:04:01.451 --> 00:04:02.618
-(wind whooshes)
-(Tai yells)

00:04:02.652 --> 00:04:04.420
What's going on?

00:04:04.454 --> 00:04:06.956
(tense music)

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:08.791
Huh?

00:04:14.464 --> 00:04:16.332
(wind whooshes)

00:04:16.365 --> 00:04:19.702
(Tai and Agumon scream)

00:04:38.321 --> 00:04:40.356
(Agumon gasps)

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:41.357
Oh boy.

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:42.792
Where are we?

00:04:42.825 --> 00:04:44.127
Tai. Tai.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.128
Wake up.

00:04:45.161 --> 00:04:47.563
(Tai groans)

00:04:48.498 --> 00:04:49.499
What?

00:04:50.666 --> 00:04:53.336
(ominous music)

00:04:58.574 --> 00:05:00.076
Keep an eye out.

00:05:09.418 --> 00:05:11.020
Something's coming.

00:05:17.193 --> 00:05:19.095
Wait, I recognize them.

00:05:26.869 --> 00:05:30.406
We battled those Digimon
the very first time we met.

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:31.440
Argomon.

00:05:34.911 --> 00:05:37.880
Tentomon said he and Izzy
fought against them too.

00:05:37.914 --> 00:05:41.684
Yeah. He took control
of ships everywhere

00:05:41.717 --> 00:05:44.453
and almost cost a
major global disaster.

00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:51.694
So now they're showing up,
not just in the network,

00:05:51.727 --> 00:05:53.296
but in the digital world?

00:06:02.471 --> 00:06:04.440
Hello to you.

00:06:04.473 --> 00:06:05.908
Huh?

00:06:05.942 --> 00:06:07.577
Hello to you.

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:09.111
Hello to you.

00:06:09.145 --> 00:06:10.246
Hello to you.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.148
Hello to you.

00:06:13.149 --> 00:06:15.818
(emotive music)

00:06:28.664 --> 00:06:29.966
Tai Kamiya.

00:06:29.999 --> 00:06:30.967
Huh?

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.001
Agumon.

00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:35.071
Hello to you.

00:06:35.104 --> 00:06:36.639
Hello to you.

00:06:36.672 --> 00:06:38.407
Hello to you.

00:06:38.441 --> 00:06:40.142
Hello to you.

00:06:40.176 --> 00:06:41.911
Hello to you.

00:06:41.944 --> 00:06:43.012
Hello to you.

00:06:43.946 --> 00:06:45.014
Hello to you.

00:07:10.706 --> 00:07:12.842
Is that an Argomon too?

00:07:16.479 --> 00:07:17.480
Yes.

00:07:18.547 --> 00:07:21.117
You are the one
called Tai Kamiya.

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:23.319
You are a human child.

00:07:23.352 --> 00:07:25.054
One of the Digi-Destined.

00:07:26.656 --> 00:07:29.025
And you are Agumon.

00:07:29.058 --> 00:07:31.027
One of the Digimon
who can evolve

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:33.496
through their connection
with the Digi-Destined.

00:07:34.997 --> 00:07:36.732
I am indeed Argomon.

00:07:37.833 --> 00:07:43.055
As are we all Argomon.

00:07:47.393 --> 00:07:50.663
All of you know all
of us Argomon already.

00:07:50.696 --> 00:07:53.466
And of course we are
quite familiar with

00:07:53.499 --> 00:07:54.667
all of you as well.

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:57.370
We recall very clearly
the fearsome battles

00:07:57.403 --> 00:07:58.871
we fought with you.

00:07:58.904 --> 00:08:01.474
We remember all of it.

00:08:01.507 --> 00:08:04.176
That's great and all but
what do you want from us?

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:07.647
You lookin' for payback because
we defeated your friends?

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:09.649
We are an existence created

00:08:09.682 --> 00:08:11.550
for one purpose alone:

00:08:11.584 --> 00:08:13.085
to fulfill the mission.

00:08:14.253 --> 00:08:16.889
Our meeting you was
not mere coincidence.

00:08:16.922 --> 00:08:19.859
It was and is the
will of our creator.

00:08:21.394 --> 00:08:22.395
-(tongues squelch)
-(tense music)

00:08:22.428 --> 00:08:24.397
-(Agumon yells)
-Agumon.

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:27.400
(ground crumbles)

00:08:27.433 --> 00:08:29.902
(Tai groans)

00:08:29.935 --> 00:08:30.936
Hang on.

00:08:41.881 --> 00:08:45.017
(claws slice)

00:08:45.051 --> 00:08:46.519
Hey Tai...

00:08:46.552 --> 00:08:48.688
(Agumon gasps)

00:08:48.721 --> 00:08:50.356
Agumon. Agumon.

00:08:50.389 --> 00:08:52.358
Agumon. Agumon.

00:08:52.391 --> 00:08:54.093
There's too many Tais.

00:08:54.126 --> 00:08:55.094
Agumon.

00:08:55.127 --> 00:08:56.095
Agumon.

00:08:56.128 --> 00:08:57.129
Agumon.

00:08:58.397 --> 00:09:01.233
(ground crumbles)

00:09:02.401 --> 00:09:05.204
(Tais groan)

00:09:05.237 --> 00:09:06.772
What is going on?

00:09:09.241 --> 00:09:11.110
I'm being strangled.

00:09:12.111 --> 00:09:13.479
What is all this?

00:09:14.914 --> 00:09:15.915
Agumon.

00:09:16.749 --> 00:09:17.750
Agumon.

00:09:18.818 --> 00:09:21.120
Don't sweat it - I'll be fine.

00:09:21.153 --> 00:09:22.788
So what? Are you just
gonna keep standing there

00:09:22.822 --> 00:09:24.123
like some kinda idiot?

00:09:24.156 --> 00:09:25.624
Get this stuff off of me.

00:09:27.259 --> 00:09:30.129
(Tai screams)

00:09:30.162 --> 00:09:31.163
I'm comin'.

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:37.636
(claw slices)

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:40.406
(digital static)

00:09:40.439 --> 00:09:41.607
(explosion)

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:42.808
(Agumon yelps)

00:09:42.842 --> 00:09:43.843
Agumon.

00:09:45.177 --> 00:09:49.415
That was a fake Tai
Kamiya you chose to save.

00:09:49.448 --> 00:09:51.751
The fakes are all
programmed to explode

00:09:51.784 --> 00:09:53.953
if you free them from
their bonds, you see.

00:09:56.288 --> 00:09:58.657
I don't get it. Why
are you doing this?

00:09:58.691 --> 00:10:00.459
[Argomon] It is an experiment.

00:10:00.493 --> 00:10:01.794
(Agumon growls)

00:10:01.827 --> 00:10:05.631
There is only one way to
escape from this place:

00:10:05.664 --> 00:10:08.367
by rescuing the real Tai Kamiya.

00:10:09.635 --> 00:10:11.504
[Tai] Agumon.

00:10:11.537 --> 00:10:14.106
[Argomon] If you do not
take action quickly,

00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:16.375
Tai Kamiya's heart
will stop beating,

00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:20.446
and you will have been
the one responsible

00:10:20.479 --> 00:10:22.715
for ending Tai Kamiya's life.

00:10:22.982 --> 00:10:24.316
(Agumon gasps)

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:26.952
[Tai] I'm the real one
Agumon, right here.

00:10:26.986 --> 00:10:29.488
[Tai] No, I'm the real
one. Can't you tell?

00:10:29.522 --> 00:10:30.856
[Tai] Over here Agumon.

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:33.492
[Tai] Cut this off
me. I can't breathe.

00:10:35.361 --> 00:10:37.062
I can't breathe Agumon.

00:10:38.197 --> 00:10:40.866
Forget about me
Agumon, save yourself.

00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:42.535
Come on, I'm the real one.

00:10:42.568 --> 00:10:44.637
-[Tai] I'm the real Tai.
-[Tai] No me.

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:46.138
The real one.

00:10:46.172 --> 00:10:51.076
The real Tai.

00:10:52.244 --> 00:10:54.180
(Agumon roars)

00:10:54.213 --> 00:10:56.048
-(digital static)
-(explosion)

00:10:56.081 --> 00:10:58.517
(Agumon screams)

00:10:58.551 --> 00:10:59.552
Agumon.

00:11:01.854 --> 00:11:02.855
Agumon.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:11.831
(foreboding music)

00:11:11.864 --> 00:11:14.600
(Agumon crashes)

00:11:16.702 --> 00:11:19.104
(Tais grunt)

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:22.741
I can't breathe.

00:11:23.776 --> 00:11:25.911
Stop this now.

00:11:25.945 --> 00:11:27.346
Can't breathe.

00:11:27.379 --> 00:11:29.849
What are you doing
Agumon? Save me.

00:11:29.882 --> 00:11:31.817
I'm dying here. Do something.

00:11:31.851 --> 00:11:33.519
[Tai] I'm the real
one over here.

00:11:33.552 --> 00:11:34.920
Can't you tell?

00:11:34.954 --> 00:11:37.189
[Tai] Agumon, save me, hurry.

00:11:37.223 --> 00:11:39.258
[Tai] Over here, help.

00:11:39.291 --> 00:11:41.527
Please Agumon.

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:42.862
Hey, don't worry.

00:11:42.895 --> 00:11:45.598
I know you'll figure out
which one of us is real.

00:11:45.631 --> 00:11:47.766
Hey, come on, hurry up
and save me already.

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:49.034
Hey help!

00:11:49.068 --> 00:11:50.569
(Tais yell)

00:11:50.603 --> 00:11:53.372
[Argomon] What will you do?

00:11:53.405 --> 00:11:55.274
Just watch me.

00:11:55.307 --> 00:11:57.209
Not that way. Come back.

00:11:57.243 --> 00:11:59.278
Hey, I'm over here.
Where you going?

00:11:59.311 --> 00:12:01.881
Just gotta cut them all loose.

00:12:01.914 --> 00:12:05.217
That's right Agumon. Get your
butt over here and save me.

00:12:05.251 --> 00:12:06.252
I'm the real one.

00:12:07.152 --> 00:12:10.122
(Agumon roars)

00:12:10.155 --> 00:12:12.925
(digital static)

00:12:13.993 --> 00:12:14.994
Agumon...

00:12:15.928 --> 00:12:18.597
(Agumon grunts)

00:12:20.666 --> 00:12:21.901
(digital static)

00:12:21.934 --> 00:12:23.068
(explosion)

00:12:23.102 --> 00:12:26.305
(Agumon groans)

00:12:26.338 --> 00:12:29.575
(Agumon grunts)

00:12:29.608 --> 00:12:30.609
Big deal.

00:12:31.944 --> 00:12:33.913
This is nothing.

00:12:33.946 --> 00:12:36.482
Tai's hurting worse than I am.

00:12:36.515 --> 00:12:37.516
Agumon.

00:12:39.451 --> 00:12:42.087
[Tai] Agumon, the
real one is me.

00:12:42.121 --> 00:12:44.123
[Tai] Hurry up and cut me down.

00:12:44.156 --> 00:12:46.458
[Tai] Over here, hurry. Save me.

00:12:46.492 --> 00:12:47.993
[Tai] Agumon, save me.

00:12:48.027 --> 00:12:49.128
I'm here.

00:12:49.161 --> 00:12:51.130
[Agumon] Tai, where are you?

00:12:51.163 --> 00:12:52.498
Where are you?

00:12:56.035 --> 00:12:57.036
I'm done for.

00:12:57.703 --> 00:12:59.672
It's over, Agumon.

00:12:59.705 --> 00:13:02.174
It's the end of the road for me.

00:13:02.207 --> 00:13:04.810
Yeah, thanks for
nothing. Thanks a lot.

00:13:04.843 --> 00:13:07.513
[Agumon] Which one
is the real Tai?

00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:11.016
I'm almost out of breath.

00:13:12.151 --> 00:13:14.520
[Agumon] What do I do?

00:13:14.553 --> 00:13:16.689
What are you
waiting for, Agumon?

00:13:16.722 --> 00:13:18.958
Cut me down before
it's too late.

00:13:18.991 --> 00:13:20.693
Do you want see me die?

00:13:20.726 --> 00:13:22.194
'Cause I will in a minute.

00:13:23.395 --> 00:13:25.631
I can't breathe,
Agumon. Help me.

00:13:25.664 --> 00:13:27.299
I'm done for. Help, help.

00:13:27.333 --> 00:13:29.301
Agumon. Agumon, help.

00:13:29.335 --> 00:13:31.337
-(Agumon screams)
-(Tais plead)

00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:32.471
Tai.

00:13:32.504 --> 00:13:35.040
Tai would know what to do
in a situation like this.

00:13:35.741 --> 00:13:37.643
What do I do?

00:13:37.676 --> 00:13:39.712
Okay, here we go.

00:13:39.745 --> 00:13:42.181
We can't, we can't lose yet.

00:13:43.082 --> 00:13:45.651
To save the Celestial Digimon,

00:13:45.684 --> 00:13:47.720
and to defend our world,

00:13:47.753 --> 00:13:50.656
that's why we came
all the way here.

00:13:50.689 --> 00:13:52.992
[Agumon] If I were Tai...

00:13:53.025 --> 00:13:54.326
Hey now, don't worry.

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:56.395
You've got this under control.

00:13:56.428 --> 00:13:58.764
Come on, you never know
until you try, right?

00:13:59.865 --> 00:14:02.167
I'll never let
Millenniumon come back,

00:14:02.201 --> 00:14:04.269
not with all the
power we've got.

00:14:05.537 --> 00:14:08.173
I swear, we're gonna
win no matter what.

00:14:09.274 --> 00:14:11.877
(heroic music)

00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:20.077
That's it.

00:14:24.056 --> 00:14:26.091
No matter how great the danger,

00:14:26.125 --> 00:14:28.260
Tai's always optimistic,

00:14:28.293 --> 00:14:30.596
always filled with courage.

00:14:30.629 --> 00:14:33.599
He would never say I'm done for.

00:14:33.632 --> 00:14:34.633
Never.

00:14:37.403 --> 00:14:40.139
(digital static)

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:43.942
(digital static)

00:14:52.251 --> 00:14:53.252
A-Agumon.

00:14:54.586 --> 00:14:55.587
There you are.

00:14:56.822 --> 00:14:57.990
Pepper Breath.

00:14:59.158 --> 00:15:01.927
(digital static)

00:15:04.096 --> 00:15:07.266
(Agumon laughs)

00:15:07.299 --> 00:15:09.635
(Duo grunt)

00:15:10.769 --> 00:15:12.971
Tai, tell me you're all right.

00:15:13.005 --> 00:15:15.107
Oh yeah. Never better.

00:15:19.678 --> 00:15:21.580
Agumon, let's go.

00:15:21.613 --> 00:15:22.781
Yeah.

00:15:22.815 --> 00:15:25.651
(energetic music)

00:15:25.684 --> 00:15:28.454
(digital static)

00:15:36.028 --> 00:15:39.364
(singing in Japanese)

00:15:41.033 --> 00:15:42.868
Agumon digivolve to...

00:15:56.849 --> 00:15:57.850
Greymon.

00:16:00.686 --> 00:16:02.621
(flame roars)

00:16:02.654 --> 00:16:05.290
(electricity sizzles)

00:16:05.324 --> 00:16:07.192
Greymon, let her rip.

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:09.228
Nova Blast.

00:16:13.165 --> 00:16:15.567
(fire roars)

00:16:20.706 --> 00:16:22.174
Take us up.

00:16:22.207 --> 00:16:23.342
You got it.

00:16:26.411 --> 00:16:28.380
Greymon digivolve to...

00:16:40.692 --> 00:16:41.727
Metalgreymon.

00:16:46.765 --> 00:16:49.868
(electricity sizzles)

00:16:59.578 --> 00:17:02.447
(electricity zaps)

00:17:20.432 --> 00:17:21.433
Giga Storm.

00:17:25.137 --> 00:17:27.372
(digital static)

00:17:27.406 --> 00:17:30.475
(Metalgreymon roars)

00:17:34.413 --> 00:17:35.414
Alter Blade.

00:17:37.649 --> 00:17:39.985
(explosion)

00:17:50.295 --> 00:17:52.497
Let's take it up a notch.

00:17:59.004 --> 00:18:01.340
Metalgreymon digivolve to...

00:18:16.955 --> 00:18:20.459
Wargreymon.

00:18:22.527 --> 00:18:24.796
(Duo yell)

00:18:29.534 --> 00:18:31.603
Terra Force.

00:18:33.639 --> 00:18:36.341
(digital static)

00:18:40.545 --> 00:18:42.881
(explosion)

00:18:47.886 --> 00:18:49.988
Where'd their ring leader go?

00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:56.862
Answer me. Who are you?

00:18:56.895 --> 00:18:59.364
(wind whooshes)

00:18:59.398 --> 00:19:03.201
Our mission is to determine
exactly what powers were born

00:19:03.235 --> 00:19:05.704
from the partnership between
you humans and the Digimon

00:19:05.737 --> 00:19:08.840
who have survived till now.

00:19:08.874 --> 00:19:12.811
That is the mission we have
been given in this time.

00:19:12.844 --> 00:19:16.181
That Argomon said this was
an experiment, remember?

00:19:17.549 --> 00:19:18.717
Why are you doing it?

00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:20.585
What is it you're after?

00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:25.157
You mentioned your creator
before, who is that?

00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:30.028
The one who created me will
be making his move very soon.

00:19:30.062 --> 00:19:31.229
(tense music)

00:19:31.263 --> 00:19:34.333
All will be reduced
to nothing and vanish.

00:19:34.366 --> 00:19:35.867
The time of the end.

00:19:37.602 --> 00:19:38.603
The end?

00:19:39.771 --> 00:19:44.776
Could that be the
Great Catastrophe?

00:19:45.377 --> 00:19:47.879
(digital beep)

00:19:54.953 --> 00:19:57.055
[Izzy] The Great Catastrophe?

00:19:57.089 --> 00:19:59.591
Argomon really told you that?

00:19:59.624 --> 00:20:01.259
So these Argomon must have been

00:20:01.293 --> 00:20:03.562
a scouting unit
doing reconnaissance.

00:20:04.563 --> 00:20:05.731
(Izzy gasps)

00:20:05.764 --> 00:20:07.933
Then that means that this
whole thing must have started

00:20:07.966 --> 00:20:10.068
with that first
incident back in Tokyo.

00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:14.573
And all the incidents since
then are part of this too,

00:20:14.606 --> 00:20:16.742
maybe even Burpmon's attack.

00:20:19.144 --> 00:20:22.447
What a sly fox, seriously.

00:20:25.617 --> 00:20:28.320
So everything's connected
to the Great Catastrophe.

00:20:29.321 --> 00:20:31.890
(Digivice beeps)

00:20:31.923 --> 00:20:33.392
I heard all about it.

00:20:33.425 --> 00:20:34.659
So what do you think?

00:20:35.927 --> 00:20:38.563
About the enemy's
actions, I mean.

00:20:38.597 --> 00:20:41.066
And the reason they make
contact with you like that,

00:20:41.099 --> 00:20:42.534
it's gotta be
because we've become

00:20:42.567 --> 00:20:45.637
a presence they can no
longer afford to ignore.

00:20:45.670 --> 00:20:47.973
[Tai] Matt, you be careful.

00:20:48.006 --> 00:20:49.641
Yeah, same to you.

00:20:51.676 --> 00:20:54.112
I guess we ought to be
heading out soon too.

00:20:54.146 --> 00:20:55.180
About time.

00:20:59.184 --> 00:21:02.020
(Digivice trills)

00:21:06.691 --> 00:21:08.293
[Tai] Argomon is watching us.

00:21:09.861 --> 00:21:12.764
So everybody, be on your guard.
