[Narrator] This is the
mysterious world

00:01:41.904 --> 00:01:42.905
where Digimon live

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.641
the Digital World.

00:01:45.675 --> 00:01:48.311
Tai Kamiya and the rest
of the Digi-Destined,

00:01:48.344 --> 00:01:51.314
journey onward to a new
stage in their adventure

00:01:51.347 --> 00:01:53.416
along with their
Digimon partners.

00:01:54.851 --> 00:01:57.487
In the real world, the
International Space Station

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.322
had hurtled toward the Earth.

00:01:59.355 --> 00:02:00.890
But Izzy and the group somehow

00:02:00.923 --> 00:02:03.693
found a way to change
its trajectory.

00:02:03.726 --> 00:02:08.731
Once again, a crisis was averted
and Tokyo escaped danger.

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:10.867
Meanwhile in the Digital World,

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:12.869
Mimi was having a wonderful time

00:02:12.902 --> 00:02:15.571
after finding herself
inexplicably showered

00:02:15.605 --> 00:02:19.008
with precious gems by
unfamiliar Digimon.

00:02:19.041 --> 00:02:21.043
What has happened to Mimi?

00:02:21.077 --> 00:02:24.380
Will Tai and his group ever
be able to safely reunite

00:02:24.413 --> 00:02:25.715
with Mimi again?

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:35.558
Okay guys!

00:02:35.591 --> 00:02:38.761
It's high time we look for
grub and fill up our bellies.

00:02:38.794 --> 00:02:40.263
You know I'm in!

00:02:40.296 --> 00:02:43.432
What do you say we split
into teams and look around?

00:02:43.466 --> 00:02:45.768
There's a chance we
might run into trouble,

00:02:45.801 --> 00:02:48.104
so don't roam too far
away from the campsite.

00:02:48.971 --> 00:02:51.374
Don't you worry, 'cause
as long as I'm with Kari,

00:02:51.407 --> 00:02:52.875
I'll defend her to the end.

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:54.710
I swear it on my life!

00:02:54.744 --> 00:02:56.579
Think you can handle
this, Patamon?

00:02:57.446 --> 00:02:59.715
Me and TK'll have lots of fun!

00:02:59.749 --> 00:03:01.617
I don't think that's
what he meant.

00:03:02.752 --> 00:03:04.720
Did you wanna play
with us too, Gatomon?

00:03:04.754 --> 00:03:06.422
-(Gatomon sighs)
-(laughter)

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:11.727
(chuckles)

00:03:11.761 --> 00:03:13.462
Don't forget we're
supposed to share those

00:03:13.496 --> 00:03:15.264
with everybody else!

00:03:15.298 --> 00:03:16.465
Sorry!

00:03:16.499 --> 00:03:19.135
I'll shake 'em loose
so you can cath them.

00:03:19.168 --> 00:03:22.572
(leaves rustling)

00:03:22.605 --> 00:03:24.473
Wait, let me help
you from down here.

00:03:24.507 --> 00:03:28.411
-(grunting)
-(tree creaking)

00:03:28.444 --> 00:03:30.079
(shouting)

00:03:30.112 --> 00:03:32.748
(tree falling)

00:03:32.782 --> 00:03:33.950
Whoa, look!

00:03:33.983 --> 00:03:38.988
Is that Tai and Agumon?

00:03:39.455 --> 00:03:40.423
(splash)

00:03:40.456 --> 00:03:41.958
Did you seriously just do that?

00:03:43.492 --> 00:03:44.493
Over here!

00:03:49.465 --> 00:03:50.600
Huh?

00:03:50.633 --> 00:03:51.601
Hey!

00:03:51.634 --> 00:03:52.768
Come back!

00:03:52.802 --> 00:03:54.303
Sora, wait for me!

00:04:02.812 --> 00:04:04.013
Well,

00:04:04.046 --> 00:04:05.448
we're still alive.

00:04:05.481 --> 00:04:07.483
I don't know how we made it.

00:04:07.516 --> 00:04:09.318
I'm sorry you guys.

00:04:09.352 --> 00:04:12.188
I should have just digivolved
as soon as I saw you.

00:04:12.221 --> 00:04:13.623
Ehhh...

00:04:13.656 --> 00:04:16.058
We were the ones who
goofed in the first place.

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.697
Is it just me, or do all
these rocks look super shiny?

00:04:26.035 --> 00:04:27.169
What in the world?

00:04:27.203 --> 00:04:30.006
(rocks crashing)

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.409
(yelling)

00:04:38.514 --> 00:04:39.715
[Tai] Uhh, who're these guys?

00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:42.151
[Agumon] Looks like
a buncha Gotsumon!

00:04:42.184 --> 00:04:43.219
Is it just me,

00:04:43.252 --> 00:04:45.521
or have we been through
this sorta thing before?

00:04:47.923 --> 00:04:49.325
Oh, it's Tai!

00:04:49.358 --> 00:04:51.027
And Sora too!

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.194
[Tai &amp; Sora] Mimi?

00:04:52.228 --> 00:04:53.996
I'm so happy I ran into you!

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.832
I mean talk about
perfect timing, huh?

00:04:56.866 --> 00:04:58.768
I hope you're ready
to get to work!

00:05:05.041 --> 00:05:06.876
[Biyomon] Is that a castle?

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:09.245
(rumbling)

00:05:09.278 --> 00:05:11.180
What do you thinks
making that noise?

00:05:11.213 --> 00:05:14.083
Whatever it is, it's
giving me the creeps.

00:05:14.116 --> 00:05:16.419
So, whose castle is this?

00:05:16.452 --> 00:05:19.255
Actually, you're looking
at the lair of a Digimon.

00:05:19.288 --> 00:05:21.057
The one who rules this place.

00:05:22.258 --> 00:05:24.560
That Digimon came and
rounded up the Gotsumon

00:05:24.593 --> 00:05:26.395
who were originally living here.

00:05:26.429 --> 00:05:29.432
They're forced to do manual
labor deep underground!

00:05:29.465 --> 00:05:31.867
And everything that they
dig up is snatched away and

00:05:31.901 --> 00:05:33.602
goes straight to the boss!

00:05:33.636 --> 00:05:36.038
This place is run
like a sweatshop!

00:05:36.072 --> 00:05:37.273
It's oppression, I tell you!

00:05:37.306 --> 00:05:39.742
The injustices of
society have taken hold

00:05:39.775 --> 00:05:41.410
of the Digital World!

00:05:41.444 --> 00:05:43.879
-(Mimi growls)
-(Tai and Sora laugh nervously)

00:05:43.913 --> 00:05:45.781
You wanna tell us what
they're mining for?

00:05:45.815 --> 00:05:48.050
Glad you asked.

00:05:48.084 --> 00:05:49.919
It's for these!

00:05:49.952 --> 00:05:52.722
[Sora] Well, that's
a very pretty stone.

00:05:52.755 --> 00:05:55.891
[Mimi] Behold, the Ruby of
the Maiden's Passionate Heart

00:05:55.925 --> 00:05:58.294
Sparkling in the
Beautiful Sunset!

00:05:58.327 --> 00:05:59.628
That's a big one.

00:05:59.662 --> 00:06:00.963
Is it really a ruby?

00:06:02.832 --> 00:06:04.967
Yeah, it does sure
looks like one to me.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.303
[Palmon] We've got lots
of and lots more, too!

00:06:07.336 --> 00:06:08.471
You see this one?

00:06:08.504 --> 00:06:10.239
It's called the
Heart-Throbbing Emerald

00:06:10.272 --> 00:06:11.640
of Fresh Green Grass!

00:06:11.674 --> 00:06:13.743
And this one's the
Sparkling Sapphire

00:06:13.776 --> 00:06:15.911
of Life Shimmering
in the Night Sky!

00:06:15.945 --> 00:06:17.680
And there's a
whole lot more too!

00:06:19.281 --> 00:06:21.317
Is that what you call them?

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:24.120
Mimi and I came up with
names for every gem!

00:06:24.153 --> 00:06:26.255
We haven't come across
any diamonds though,

00:06:26.288 --> 00:06:28.457
so we're one gem
short of perfection.

00:06:29.959 --> 00:06:31.327
Well their names are kinda long,

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.162
but they're nice enough I guess.

00:06:33.195 --> 00:06:35.765
So where've you been
finding these things anyway?

00:06:35.798 --> 00:06:37.333
They're hidden all
over the place.

00:06:37.366 --> 00:06:39.602
But for the absolute
biggest number of them,

00:06:39.635 --> 00:06:41.937
you gotta dig under that castle.

00:06:41.971 --> 00:06:44.273
Me and Gotsumon friends...

00:06:44.306 --> 00:06:45.808
forced to work.

00:06:45.841 --> 00:06:48.511
And no rest time allowed.

00:06:48.544 --> 00:06:49.845
Dig and dig.

00:06:49.879 --> 00:06:52.148
Never stop, always working.

00:06:52.181 --> 00:06:55.017
[Sora] Wait, then you
were down there too?

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:57.453
[Mimi] These are all the
Digimon who managed to escape

00:06:57.486 --> 00:06:59.021
with their lives.

00:06:59.054 --> 00:07:00.856
They were taking
refuge in the rocks,

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:03.726
before Palmon and I happened
to fly into their hideaway.

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:07.696
At first, they thought we
were sent to spy on them,

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:10.166
and we ended up getting
chased around the rocks.

00:07:12.034 --> 00:07:14.203
But after the ensuing
exchange of fists

00:07:14.236 --> 00:07:16.972
between Togemon and Golemon,

00:07:17.006 --> 00:07:19.875
and the frenzy of
fun and excitement,

00:07:19.909 --> 00:07:22.978
any bad first impressions
were swept under the rug.

00:07:23.012 --> 00:07:25.414
(bell dings)

00:07:26.582 --> 00:07:28.551
Before we knew it, we
were getting along,

00:07:28.584 --> 00:07:30.820
and Mimi's second
kingdom was born,

00:07:30.853 --> 00:07:31.987
naturally!

00:07:32.021 --> 00:07:33.589
[Sora] Oh, so that's
what happened.

00:07:34.523 --> 00:07:35.691
All right!

00:07:35.724 --> 00:07:37.393
That's enough jibber-jabber!

00:07:37.426 --> 00:07:40.062
Now that we've accumulated
enough manpower here,

00:07:40.095 --> 00:07:43.232
we can finally execute our
first order of operation!

00:07:43.265 --> 00:07:45.034
Uh, operation?

00:07:45.067 --> 00:07:46.035
Yep!

00:07:46.068 --> 00:07:47.670
A project like no other!

00:07:47.703 --> 00:07:49.538
We're gonna crush that castle!

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:53.409
You wanna save the Digimon
from their suffering.

00:07:53.442 --> 00:07:54.844
That's what you mean, right?

00:07:54.877 --> 00:07:56.045
Admirable.

00:07:56.078 --> 00:07:58.581
Get ready, because I'll
never forgive them!

00:08:00.282 --> 00:08:03.385
They'll rue the day they chose
to hoard all the profits!

00:08:03.419 --> 00:08:04.887
-[Sora] What?
-[Tai] Uh...

00:08:07.122 --> 00:08:08.424
My late grandfather,

00:08:08.457 --> 00:08:10.759
was the great
Genichiro Tachikawa.

00:08:10.793 --> 00:08:14.230
As the head of Tachikawa
Heavy Industries, he'd say,

00:08:14.263 --> 00:08:16.765
"A company where people are
rewarded for their efforts

00:08:16.799 --> 00:08:18.868
and smile while they work,

00:08:18.901 --> 00:08:21.937
that's what Tachikawa Heavy
Industries strives to be!"

00:08:23.072 --> 00:08:24.773
Toiling all day and night,

00:08:24.807 --> 00:08:27.610
burning yourself out and
having no say in the matter?

00:08:27.643 --> 00:08:30.079
Grinding into dust while the
fat cats reap the benefits?

00:08:30.112 --> 00:08:31.113
It's tyranny!

00:08:32.248 --> 00:08:34.450
And I refuse to
look the other way!

00:08:34.483 --> 00:08:36.719
(cheering)

00:08:36.752 --> 00:08:38.120
Uh, yeah.

00:08:38.153 --> 00:08:41.056
Not sure why we're
cheering, but hooray!

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:43.726
Didn't understand a
word, but go Mimi!

00:08:43.759 --> 00:08:44.727
Oh, great.

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:46.896
I'm glad we're all in, I guess.

00:08:46.929 --> 00:08:48.931
Now everybody get to work!

00:08:48.964 --> 00:08:51.300
And give me
everything you've got!

00:08:51.333 --> 00:08:52.968
(cheering)

00:08:53.002 --> 00:08:54.904
Yes boss!

00:08:54.937 --> 00:08:56.138
Ready!

00:08:56.171 --> 00:08:59.575
Servant Number 99
reporting for duty!

00:08:59.608 --> 00:09:00.910
Let's go!

00:09:00.943 --> 00:09:01.911
Yikes.

00:09:01.944 --> 00:09:03.746
Tai's Servant Number 72.

00:09:03.779 --> 00:09:06.148
And Sora's Servant Number 73!

00:09:06.181 --> 00:09:07.416
Isn't that right?

00:09:07.449 --> 00:09:09.919
Whoa, you actually
remembered that?

00:09:09.952 --> 00:09:11.587
What are you talking about?

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:13.155
Oh right, we had numbers.

00:09:13.188 --> 00:09:15.758
And don't you ever
forget them, you hear?

00:09:15.791 --> 00:09:17.092
But today's different.

00:09:17.126 --> 00:09:18.827
You'll be my employees instead!

00:09:18.861 --> 00:09:19.862
How does that sound?

00:09:20.796 --> 00:09:22.665
Nice to meet you!

00:09:22.698 --> 00:09:23.999
Welcome, 72!

00:09:24.033 --> 00:09:26.502
And welcome, 73.

00:09:26.535 --> 00:09:28.003
Oh, hello?

00:09:28.037 --> 00:09:29.772
Happy to be here.

00:09:29.805 --> 00:09:31.140
Without further ado...

00:09:31.173 --> 00:09:33.108
Time for the Mimi Kingdom

00:09:33.142 --> 00:09:35.444
and Mimi Company Workplace
Improvement Project

00:09:35.477 --> 00:09:36.445
to begin at last!

00:09:36.478 --> 00:09:37.479
Here we go!

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:40.683
(cheering)

00:09:40.716 --> 00:09:41.951
Seriously?

00:09:41.984 --> 00:09:44.320
Feels more like the Mimi
Peer Pressure Project.

00:09:46.889 --> 00:09:49.058
(yawns)

00:09:50.059 --> 00:09:51.193
[Izzy] Roger that, Tai.

00:09:51.226 --> 00:09:53.062
We'll start heading
over there ASAP.

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:56.332
-(Digivice beeps)
-It'll take us a while, though.

00:09:56.365 --> 00:09:58.467
I wonder how far
out everyone went.

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:00.336
It's hard to catch up.

00:10:00.369 --> 00:10:02.705
At times like these,
I find myself wishing

00:10:02.738 --> 00:10:05.708
our Digivices had positional
tracking to help us.

00:10:05.741 --> 00:10:06.875
Well in the meantime,

00:10:06.909 --> 00:10:09.078
we should just keep
moving along this river.

00:10:10.346 --> 00:10:11.714
Wait a second,

00:10:11.747 --> 00:10:14.550
is it me, or are we
starting to drift away?

00:10:19.188 --> 00:10:20.522
You gotta be kidding me!

00:10:20.556 --> 00:10:22.324
I think he passed out!

00:10:22.358 --> 00:10:24.493
He's asleep at the wheel!

00:10:24.526 --> 00:10:25.894
[Patamon] Wake up, Komondomon!

00:10:25.928 --> 00:10:28.573
-Rise and shine!
-[Tentomon] Wakey wakey!

00:10:40.192 --> 00:10:41.260
[Sora] Ready, Birdamon?

00:10:41.293 --> 00:10:43.429
Let's show them what we got!

00:10:43.462 --> 00:10:46.932
(metal clanging)

00:10:46.965 --> 00:10:49.668
(hisses)

00:10:49.702 --> 00:10:50.669
[Sora] Here it comes!

00:10:50.703 --> 00:10:52.037
Then up we go!

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:57.309
First off, we need to get
the lookout's attention.

00:10:58.210 --> 00:10:59.311
Sunarizamon.

00:11:00.379 --> 00:11:02.448
Shoots sand from mouth.

00:11:02.481 --> 00:11:03.682
Deadly.

00:11:03.716 --> 00:11:06.685
But still, aim can
only reach so high.

00:11:08.987 --> 00:11:11.523
Tai's group should be
making the next move!

00:11:11.557 --> 00:11:13.659
(grunts)

00:11:18.497 --> 00:11:21.166
(loud crashing)

00:11:26.071 --> 00:11:27.039
Oh, wow!

00:11:27.072 --> 00:11:28.707
I think I actually broke
a sweat back there!

00:11:28.741 --> 00:11:31.543
Same, I'm a little pooped!

00:11:31.577 --> 00:11:34.680
Uh, you're not the ones who
did the all the digging.

00:11:38.684 --> 00:11:41.820
Exploiting these poor Gotsumon
into endless drudgery?

00:11:41.854 --> 00:11:44.490
You've got some real nerve
doing that on my watch!

00:11:44.523 --> 00:11:47.326
Any wicked manager who dares
to treat their diligent workers

00:11:47.359 --> 00:11:48.861
poorly shall be laid off!

00:11:50.429 --> 00:11:52.364
For in the name of Tachikawa,

00:11:52.397 --> 00:11:54.233
I will corporately punish you!

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:57.536
(groans)

00:11:58.871 --> 00:12:00.672
Yo Mimi, be careful!

00:12:00.706 --> 00:12:01.840
Go teach 'em a lesson!

00:12:01.874 --> 00:12:04.743
I choose you, Number 72!

00:12:04.777 --> 00:12:06.845
[Tai &amp; Greymon] Huh?
You talking to us?

00:12:06.879 --> 00:12:07.846
Whatever.

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:08.914
Better move.

00:12:08.947 --> 00:12:10.249
Let's do it, Greymon!

00:12:10.282 --> 00:12:11.283
Okay!

00:12:14.286 --> 00:12:16.221
(thud)

00:12:18.423 --> 00:12:20.192
Okay, cough it up, buster!

00:12:20.225 --> 00:12:22.728
C'mon! Tell us where
the sparkly stones are

00:12:22.761 --> 00:12:24.463
before I lose my patience!

00:12:26.465 --> 00:12:30.202
Goburimon say, keep
shiny rocks at very top.

00:12:30.235 --> 00:12:31.703
Good to know!

00:12:31.737 --> 00:12:33.739
You come along with us, Golemon!

00:12:33.772 --> 00:12:34.773
Okay!

00:12:38.777 --> 00:12:41.280
Wait, where do you
think you're going?

00:12:41.313 --> 00:12:43.549
While Sora provides
us with a distraction,

00:12:43.582 --> 00:12:45.117
we'll start digging underground.

00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:47.052
Then we'll rescue the
Gotsumon from the castle

00:12:47.085 --> 00:12:49.087
and make our way outta there!

00:12:49.121 --> 00:12:50.756
What happened to our plan?!

00:12:50.789 --> 00:12:52.257
Time for Plan B!

00:12:52.291 --> 00:12:54.393
We'll leave that to you!

00:12:54.426 --> 00:12:56.228
What do you mean, Plan B?

00:12:56.261 --> 00:12:58.764
We did not cover
this at the meeting.

00:12:59.665 --> 00:13:01.967
(hisses)

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.569
We've got company!

00:13:03.602 --> 00:13:04.903
Not for long!

00:13:04.937 --> 00:13:05.938
Nova Blast!

00:13:10.642 --> 00:13:13.078
Not really feeling Plan B...

00:13:13.111 --> 00:13:14.146
I've got this.

00:13:14.179 --> 00:13:16.481
You go on ahead, Tai.

00:13:16.515 --> 00:13:17.482
Thanks a lot.

00:13:17.516 --> 00:13:19.318
Go get 'em, buddy!

00:13:19.351 --> 00:13:20.752
Hey!

00:13:20.786 --> 00:13:22.421
Right behind you, Mimi!

00:13:22.454 --> 00:13:25.157
Slow down, will ya?

00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:26.658
Over there!

00:13:26.692 --> 00:13:27.693
See?

00:13:29.161 --> 00:13:30.495
[Palmon] What's he guarding?

00:13:30.529 --> 00:13:33.866
I bet their gems are
behind that door!

00:13:35.334 --> 00:13:36.335
Now, Palmon!

00:13:37.803 --> 00:13:39.872
Palmon digivolve to...!

00:13:43.141 --> 00:13:44.443
Togemon!

00:13:44.476 --> 00:13:47.045
(bouncing thuds)

00:13:49.514 --> 00:13:50.983
You're welcome!

00:13:51.016 --> 00:13:53.652
Consider that a nice company
bonus for your loyal service.

00:13:53.685 --> 00:13:57.155
Oof, I'd hate to see the
retirement package...

00:14:00.559 --> 00:14:02.661
(giggles)

00:14:02.694 --> 00:14:04.296
Wow!

00:14:04.329 --> 00:14:07.633
So uh, these are all
the real thing, right?

00:14:07.666 --> 00:14:08.700
Of course they are!

00:14:08.734 --> 00:14:09.701
Can't you tell?

00:14:09.735 --> 00:14:12.037
This one looks just like topaz!

00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:14.172
This one's purple like amethyst!

00:14:14.206 --> 00:14:16.708
And there's rubies
and sapphires galore!

00:14:16.742 --> 00:14:18.310
Isn't this your lucky day.

00:14:18.343 --> 00:14:19.544
Sure is!

00:14:19.578 --> 00:14:21.179
You just reminded me.

00:14:21.213 --> 00:14:23.315
I have an important
announcement to make!

00:14:23.348 --> 00:14:24.650
[Tai] Oh?

00:14:24.683 --> 00:14:26.151
I'm promoting you, Tai!

00:14:26.184 --> 00:14:29.388
From this moment on, you'll be
our company transport chief!

00:14:29.421 --> 00:14:31.023
[Togemon] Congratulations!

00:14:31.056 --> 00:14:32.391
That's a senior role!

00:14:32.424 --> 00:14:34.059
I'm way too young!

00:14:34.393 --> 00:14:36.395
[Mimi] Huh?

00:14:36.428 --> 00:14:37.863
Where did that come from?

00:14:40.766 --> 00:14:42.000
Could it be?

00:14:42.034 --> 00:14:44.069
I can hardly believe my eyes!

00:14:44.102 --> 00:14:47.372
It's the first diamond I've
stumbled upon since I got here!

00:14:47.406 --> 00:14:49.541
Not to mention a
hefty one at that!

00:14:49.574 --> 00:14:51.276
Ah, it's a dream come true!

00:14:52.544 --> 00:14:54.079
That's wonderful, Mimi!

00:14:54.112 --> 00:14:55.514
It is.

00:14:55.547 --> 00:14:58.717
I'll name this gem the
Tachikawa Diamond after myself!

00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:01.186
-(rumbling)
-What's that noise?

00:15:01.219 --> 00:15:03.931
[Tai] It's the same
sound we heard outside!

00:15:12.481 --> 00:15:15.384
Hey, is that a
Digimon over there?

00:15:15.417 --> 00:15:17.753
Yeah, and I think it's
...eating the stones?

00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:20.389
-Need more.
-(rocks crunching)

00:15:20.422 --> 00:15:23.058
Still not full.

00:15:23.091 --> 00:15:24.793
Always hungry.

00:15:24.826 --> 00:15:26.662
Stomach growling.

00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:30.232
(gem clatters)

00:15:30.265 --> 00:15:31.466
It's a diamond!

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:34.169
I bet he spat out the
one we found earlier too!

00:15:35.304 --> 00:15:37.072
What gives, big mouth!

00:15:37.105 --> 00:15:38.440
What are you doing?!

00:15:39.441 --> 00:15:41.510
(growls)

00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:46.248
It's Gogmamon.

00:15:46.281 --> 00:15:47.649
An Ultimate Digimon!

00:15:48.784 --> 00:15:49.985
What do you think you're doing

00:15:50.018 --> 00:15:51.987
gobbling my gemstones
like bonbons?

00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:54.156
[Gogmamon] This castle is mine.

00:15:54.189 --> 00:15:56.458
Everything in it is mine.

00:15:56.491 --> 00:15:58.927
That's a direct breach
of the Anti-Monopoly Act,

00:15:58.960 --> 00:15:59.961
you creep!

00:16:00.996 --> 00:16:03.832
[Gogmamon] Fine, what
shall I snack on then?

00:16:03.865 --> 00:16:04.833
You?

00:16:04.866 --> 00:16:05.967
What was that?

00:16:06.001 --> 00:16:07.336
Snack?

00:16:07.369 --> 00:16:08.603
On us?

00:16:08.637 --> 00:16:10.772
[Gogmamon] You look
tastier than Gotsumon.

00:16:10.806 --> 00:16:12.007
(gasps)

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:13.108
[Tai] What the...

00:16:13.141 --> 00:16:15.310
Don't tell me he ate them too...

00:16:15.344 --> 00:16:17.379
(growls)

00:16:20.349 --> 00:16:22.017
Won't forgive you!

00:16:25.187 --> 00:16:28.023
(yelling)

00:16:28.056 --> 00:16:29.791
Oh really?

00:16:29.825 --> 00:16:30.859
Giant Grater!

00:16:31.993 --> 00:16:34.796
(screaming)

00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:36.865
(crash)

00:16:36.898 --> 00:16:37.866
Togemon!

00:16:37.899 --> 00:16:38.900
Golemon!

00:16:42.371 --> 00:16:43.705
[Tai] Golemon!

00:16:44.539 --> 00:16:45.507
(groans)

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:46.875
You gonna make it, buddy?

00:16:46.908 --> 00:16:49.044
Yeah...

00:16:49.077 --> 00:16:51.346
(rumbling)

00:16:54.015 --> 00:16:55.817
That Digimon...

00:16:55.851 --> 00:16:56.852
Too strong!

00:16:58.253 --> 00:16:59.254
Mimi!

00:17:00.389 --> 00:17:01.390
Run away!

00:17:02.724 --> 00:17:03.725
Golemon!

00:17:04.693 --> 00:17:06.762
(growls)

00:17:10.198 --> 00:17:12.868
[Mimi] I've had enough of you!

00:17:17.739 --> 00:17:18.874
[Tai] Uh, Mimi?

00:17:20.275 --> 00:17:23.412
Everything here is
mine to consume.

00:17:23.445 --> 00:17:25.547
Rocks, other Digimon.

00:17:26.748 --> 00:17:28.250
All of it belongs to --

00:17:28.283 --> 00:17:29.284
Belongs to me!

00:17:29.951 --> 00:17:31.853
Oof, here we go...

00:17:31.887 --> 00:17:33.688
How dare you!

00:17:33.722 --> 00:17:35.056
It's a disgrace!

00:17:36.291 --> 00:17:38.226
He's a beloved employee.

00:17:39.394 --> 00:17:41.696
And I won't leave
my employees behind!

00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:43.031
If you think I will,

00:17:43.064 --> 00:17:45.534
you've got another thing coming!

00:17:45.567 --> 00:17:47.736
Togemon digivolve to...!

00:17:52.974 --> 00:17:53.975
Lillymon!

00:17:55.243 --> 00:17:57.245
No more bargaining!

00:17:57.279 --> 00:17:58.413
Giant Grater!

00:18:01.616 --> 00:18:04.119
Flower Cannon!

00:18:04.152 --> 00:18:06.488
(explosion)

00:18:10.292 --> 00:18:13.061
(rocks crunching)

00:18:13.094 --> 00:18:14.796
(growls)

00:18:14.830 --> 00:18:16.331
What's he doing?

00:18:17.632 --> 00:18:19.267
Curse Refraction!

00:18:21.970 --> 00:18:23.972
(crash)

00:18:30.679 --> 00:18:32.647
(rock crunching)

00:18:32.681 --> 00:18:33.648
Lillymon!

00:18:33.682 --> 00:18:34.916
Let him have it!

00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:35.917
Okay!

00:18:35.951 --> 00:18:36.918
Flower...

00:18:36.952 --> 00:18:39.087
(rocks crunching)

00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:40.422
Cannon!

00:18:40.455 --> 00:18:41.456
Curse Refraction!

00:18:45.193 --> 00:18:48.663
(rocks crunching)

00:18:48.697 --> 00:18:52.000
(gem clatters)

00:18:52.033 --> 00:18:53.101
There's our answer!

00:18:53.134 --> 00:18:54.135
Hurry!

00:18:56.304 --> 00:18:57.272
Lillymon!

00:18:57.305 --> 00:18:58.874
Use this to attack!

00:18:59.875 --> 00:19:01.276
Are you sure?

00:19:01.309 --> 00:19:02.511
That's a diamond.

00:19:02.544 --> 00:19:03.979
Isn't it too precious?

00:19:04.012 --> 00:19:04.980
I'll survive.

00:19:05.013 --> 00:19:07.148
I have other precious things

00:19:07.182 --> 00:19:12.120
worth way more!

00:19:12.153 --> 00:19:13.989
Mimi never gives up!

00:19:14.022 --> 00:19:17.292
It's over for you!

00:19:17.325 --> 00:19:22.330
Curse Refraction!

00:19:25.667 --> 00:19:27.035
Of course!

00:19:27.068 --> 00:19:28.970
Your chompers can bite through
everything except diamonds,

00:19:29.004 --> 00:19:30.005
right?

00:19:30.038 --> 00:19:31.907
That's why you were
spitting them out earlier!

00:19:33.174 --> 00:19:34.843
[Greymon] There you are!

00:19:34.876 --> 00:19:35.977
Perfect timing you guys!

00:19:36.011 --> 00:19:37.712
[Sora] You had us worried!

00:19:37.746 --> 00:19:39.314
[Biyomon] What did we miss?

00:19:39.347 --> 00:19:41.516
Know what my
grandpa used to say?

00:19:43.184 --> 00:19:44.653
"The people you work with

00:19:44.686 --> 00:19:46.688
are as precious as family."

00:19:47.756 --> 00:19:49.324
When you neglect family

00:19:49.357 --> 00:19:51.192
this is the price you pay!

00:19:51.226 --> 00:19:52.227
That's right!

00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:53.261
Here we go!

00:19:55.096 --> 00:19:56.865
Effective immediately...!

00:19:56.898 --> 00:19:59.701
[Mimi &amp; Lillymon] You're fired!

00:20:06.441 --> 00:20:08.610
(yelling)

00:20:17.786 --> 00:20:20.422
(cheers)

00:20:20.455 --> 00:20:21.856
That was amazing Mimi!

00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:24.259
You weren't so bad
yourself there, Lillymon!

00:20:25.427 --> 00:20:26.428
Serious teamwork,

00:20:26.461 --> 00:20:27.429
Great job.

00:20:27.462 --> 00:20:29.531
You sure showed them who's boss!

00:20:29.564 --> 00:20:30.532
Mimi.

00:20:30.565 --> 00:20:31.566
Leader.

00:20:32.767 --> 00:20:34.703
Our fearless...

00:20:34.736 --> 00:20:35.937
President.

00:20:42.243 --> 00:20:44.112
(Gotsumon chittering)

00:20:44.145 --> 00:20:45.113
Au revoir!

00:20:45.146 --> 00:20:46.615
You take care now!

00:20:46.648 --> 00:20:49.084
Golemon, I'm leaving
you in charge.

00:20:49.117 --> 00:20:50.552
Yay!

00:20:50.585 --> 00:20:54.789
As acting president of
Mimi Company, I will...

00:20:55.957 --> 00:20:58.660
I will work hard 'til
Mimi come back someday.

00:20:59.594 --> 00:21:03.431
Please, Number 72, 73.

00:21:03.465 --> 00:21:04.666
Take care of her.

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:07.435
Our precious leader.

00:21:07.469 --> 00:21:08.570
[Tai] We will.

00:21:08.603 --> 00:21:10.572
Do your best, Number 99.

00:21:10.605 --> 00:21:12.240
And Gotsumon, too!

00:21:12.273 --> 00:21:14.509
(cheering)

00:21:15.944 --> 00:21:18.013
Oh, and one more thing!

00:21:19.681 --> 00:21:21.316
Don't you ever forget:

00:21:21.349 --> 00:21:23.485
a company's not
just where you work.

00:21:23.518 --> 00:21:26.755
It's so much more
than that, y'know?

00:21:26.788 --> 00:21:29.658
It's about
accomplishing something

00:21:29.691 --> 00:21:31.626
with your friends!

00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:32.627
Okay?

00:21:32.661 --> 00:21:34.863

The Fist of the Beast King

super-toned body

Now, let's check this out!

00:22:54.109 --> 00:22:56.745
Those powerful pecs
and dynamic delts!

00:22:56.778 --> 00:22:59.247
Those beefy biceps
and awesome abdominals

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:01.249
look like they were
carved from marble!

00:23:01.282 --> 00:23:04.052
If Leomon owned a gym, I'd
sign up in a heartbeat!
