Well, well!

Look who it is.

00:02:42.228 --> 00:02:43.521
It's been awhile.

00:02:43.521 --> 00:02:44.689
How's ElDradimon?

00:02:45.607 --> 00:02:46.608
Huh?

[Digimon] Well,
there it goes again.

00:03:12.717 --> 00:03:14.094
When will they ever give up?

00:03:14.135 --> 00:03:16.054
[Kamemon] I can't believe
they're still at it.

00:03:16.054 --> 00:03:18.306
[KaratsukiNumemon]
Don't they ever give up?

00:03:20.892 --> 00:03:23.228
-(TK groaning)
-(Patamon groaning)

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:24.729
[Tai] TK! You all right?

00:03:24.771 --> 00:03:25.730
Hey, look!

00:03:25.772 --> 00:03:26.773
It's Tai!

00:03:27.816 --> 00:03:29.901
Kari wanted to
stay in the forest,

00:03:29.901 --> 00:03:32.070
but me and Patamon
left on a journey

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.406
to follow the Digivice's arrow.

00:03:34.447 --> 00:03:36.991
Which is how we came
across ElDradimon here.

00:03:38.326 --> 00:03:40.286
[Leomon] You see,
ElDradimon decided to start

00:03:40.328 --> 00:03:41.955
climbing this mountain,

00:03:41.996 --> 00:03:43.415
but because of the steep slope,

00:03:43.456 --> 00:03:44.999
he's gotten himself stuck.

00:03:47.585 --> 00:03:48.962
[Tai] Do you think it's possible

00:03:49.003 --> 00:03:52.424
he might actually be
trying to climb up there?

00:03:53.466 --> 00:03:55.093
[Leomon] Well, he was originally

00:03:55.093 --> 00:03:56.970
living on the Cloud Continent.

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.266
So, ElDradimon
probably just wants

00:04:01.266 --> 00:04:02.517
to return to his home.

00:04:03.935 --> 00:04:05.770
No matter how many
times he falls,

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:07.355
he never quits climbing.

00:04:09.357 --> 00:04:11.276
We can't just leave ElDradimon

00:04:11.276 --> 00:04:12.485
stuck here like this!

00:04:12.527 --> 00:04:14.779
(Komondomon barking)

00:04:14.779 --> 00:04:16.448
(TK gasping)

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:17.449
Oh wow!

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:19.117
You brought that rope for us?

00:04:19.117 --> 00:04:20.118
Thank you!

00:04:25.206 --> 00:04:27.250
[Tai] Who are those
Digimon down there?

00:04:27.292 --> 00:04:28.668
[Leomon] Those are
all Digimon who

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.795
lost their homes due
to the destruction

00:04:30.795 --> 00:04:32.046
caused by Millenniummon.

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:38.303
(explosion)

00:04:43.016 --> 00:04:44.476
[Agumon] There's so many of 'em.

00:04:44.476 --> 00:04:46.144
[Tai] That explains
why all of them

00:04:46.186 --> 00:04:47.228
seem a little down.

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:51.024
Lopmon is out searching
for a new place

00:04:51.065 --> 00:04:53.359
for them all to
live as we speak.

00:04:55.153 --> 00:04:57.363
However, the pain
of losing one's home

00:04:57.405 --> 00:04:59.157
doesn't go away that easily.

00:05:00.658 --> 00:05:02.494
I see what you're trying to do,

00:05:02.535 --> 00:05:04.662
but I'm saying this
for your own good.

00:05:04.704 --> 00:05:06.414
Just give up already.

00:05:07.248 --> 00:05:10.168
I mean, how long are you
gonna keep up this nonsense?

00:05:10.168 --> 00:05:12.545
It's too dangerous
to even watch.

00:05:12.587 --> 00:05:14.172
[KaratsukiNumemon]
It's an impossible task

00:05:14.214 --> 00:05:15.924
for a small child like that.

00:05:17.842 --> 00:05:20.512
As you can see, everyone
is trying to stop them

00:05:20.512 --> 00:05:22.555
because it's so dangerous.

00:05:22.597 --> 00:05:25.683
However, they seem determined
to help ElDradimon,

00:05:25.725 --> 00:05:28.019
even if it means putting
themselves at risk.

00:05:28.061 --> 00:05:29.521
We're gonna do it this time.

00:05:29.521 --> 00:05:30.522
Ready, Patamon?

00:05:30.522 --> 00:05:31.856

-(Patamon giggling)

00:05:33.441 --> 00:05:36.069
Why are they so
eager to help anyway?

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:37.070
We should go too.

00:05:37.111 --> 00:05:38.863

00:05:38.863 --> 00:05:39.864

Correct me if I'm wrong,

00:05:49.415 --> 00:05:51.543
but you're Gravimon, aren't you?

00:05:51.543 --> 00:05:53.711
Would you mind helping
us out a little bit here

00:05:53.711 --> 00:05:56.047

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:36.976
Sure thing!

00:09:37.018 --> 00:09:38.811
(metal creaking)

00:09:38.853 --> 00:09:40.605
(rope creaking)

00:09:40.646 --> 00:09:43.775
(ElDradimon roaring)

00:09:44.942 --> 00:09:48.279
-He's just too big.
-Here we go again.

00:09:48.279 --> 00:09:49.947
[Digimon] Why haven't
they given up already?

00:09:49.989 --> 00:09:51.657
[Digimon] Aw man,
he's way too heavy.

00:09:51.699 --> 00:09:54.202
He's never gonna get up there.

00:09:56.996 --> 00:09:59.665
(Shamamon gasping)

00:09:59.707 --> 00:10:03.294
(bright horn music)

00:10:03.294 --> 00:10:05.797
(TK growling)

00:10:07.465 --> 00:10:08.633
[TK] Are you...

00:10:08.633 --> 00:10:10.176
I wanna help you guys out.

00:10:10.218 --> 00:10:13.513
Watching you made me wanna
send ElDradimon home, too.

00:10:13.554 --> 00:10:16.307
(Elecmon growling)

00:10:16.349 --> 00:10:17.642
(TK chuckling)

00:10:17.642 --> 00:10:18.643
Sweet!

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:20.520
Let's go!

00:10:20.561 --> 00:10:21.979
Again!

00:10:21.979 --> 00:10:25.316
(Angemon chuckling)

00:10:25.316 --> 00:10:27.527
[Digimon] Well, now what?

00:10:30.029 --> 00:10:31.656
What should we do?

00:10:31.697 --> 00:10:34.325
[NiseDrimogemon] We can't
move a Digimon that big.

00:10:34.325 --> 00:10:36.661
[KaratsukiNumemon] Too
bad he can't just fly.

00:10:36.661 --> 00:10:37.829
[NiseDrimogemon] He's
not getting anywhere

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:42.583
with that huge body of his.

00:10:57.431 --> 00:10:59.267
(chimes ringing)

00:10:59.308 --> 00:11:04.105
-(intense music)
-(ElDradimon roaring)

00:11:04.146 --> 00:11:06.941
(group growling)

00:11:08.317 --> 00:11:11.279
(MetalGreymon growling)

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:14.156
(Leomon growling)

00:11:14.991 --> 00:11:18.119
(ElDradimon roaring)

00:11:20.288 --> 00:11:23.124
-(TK growling)
-(Tai growling)

00:11:23.165 --> 00:11:26.419
(Leomon growling)

00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:29.505
(ElDradimon roaring)

00:11:30.965 --> 00:11:33.634
(intense music)

00:11:35.136 --> 00:11:36.262
(Angemon gasping)

00:11:36.304 --> 00:11:38.139
(Leomon gasping)

00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:40.641
-(group growling)
-What are you doing?

00:11:42.685 --> 00:11:44.979
We're helping you
out, that's what!

00:11:46.647 --> 00:11:48.608
Well, it couldn't
hurt to try, right?

00:11:48.649 --> 00:11:49.650
(TK gasping)

00:11:49.692 --> 00:11:51.611
You guys...

00:11:51.652 --> 00:11:56.657
-(intense music)
-(heavy footsteps)

00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:01.120
It's Monzaemon!

00:12:01.162 --> 00:12:02.163
The real one, too!

00:12:03.205 --> 00:12:04.165
Ready?

00:12:04.206 --> 00:12:06.626
(TK humming)

00:12:06.667 --> 00:12:07.960
On your mark!

00:12:08.002 --> 00:12:09.170
Get set!

00:12:09.211 --> 00:12:10.504
Go, everyone!

00:12:10.546 --> 00:12:13.341
(group growling)

00:12:17.219 --> 00:12:20.348
(ElDradimon roaring)

00:12:23.517 --> 00:12:25.353
(thud)

00:12:25.353 --> 00:12:26.979
That's it!

00:12:27.021 --> 00:12:29.523
(group gasping)

00:12:29.565 --> 00:12:30.524
[Digimon] Amazing!

00:12:30.566 --> 00:12:31.692
Maybe we should go.

00:12:31.734 --> 00:12:33.027
-We should!
-Let's go help out!

00:12:33.027 --> 00:12:34.695
Don't tell me you really think

00:12:34.695 --> 00:12:37.073
you can send that
Digimon back up there?

00:12:38.199 --> 00:12:39.367
I don't for sure.

00:12:40.159 --> 00:12:41.702
Still, I've been
watching those guys

00:12:41.744 --> 00:12:43.704
giving it their all
this whole time,

00:12:43.746 --> 00:12:45.748
so I can't sit here
and do nothing.

00:12:48.376 --> 00:12:50.211
Keep it up, everybody!

00:12:50.252 --> 00:12:51.671
Now push!

00:12:51.712 --> 00:12:53.214
(TK growling)

00:12:53.214 --> 00:12:55.174
(group growling)

00:12:55.216 --> 00:12:57.551
(Tai growling)

00:12:57.593 --> 00:13:00.388
(group growling)

00:13:03.099 --> 00:13:05.351
(thud)

00:13:05.393 --> 00:13:08.062
(intense music)

00:13:20.074 --> 00:13:22.743
(group growling)

00:13:28.582 --> 00:13:31.627
(ElDradimon roaring)

00:13:33.087 --> 00:13:35.381
[Tai] The slope is
getting steeper!

00:13:35.423 --> 00:13:37.425
We're almost there!

00:13:37.466 --> 00:13:38.426
Ready?

00:13:38.467 --> 00:13:39.427
And...

00:13:39.468 --> 00:13:40.761
(group growling)

00:13:40.761 --> 00:13:41.929
[KaratsukiNumemon] Push!

00:13:41.929 --> 00:13:42.930
Push!

00:13:44.265 --> 00:13:45.891
He isn't moving!

00:13:45.933 --> 00:13:48.269
Then we ain't
pulling hard enough!

00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:50.563
(group growling)

00:13:50.604 --> 00:13:52.940
It all comes down to this!

00:13:54.442 --> 00:13:56.068
-(ElDradimon roaring)
-[Tai] Everyone,

00:13:56.110 --> 00:13:58.070
push together now!

00:13:58.112 --> 00:14:00.781
(group growling)

00:14:00.823 --> 00:14:03.617
(TK panting)

00:14:03.617 --> 00:14:05.244
(Angemon panting)

00:14:05.286 --> 00:14:06.287
Aw man.

00:14:06.328 --> 00:14:07.788
(Tai sighing)

00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:09.623
It's only a little further, too.

00:14:09.665 --> 00:14:11.125
We're not done yet.

00:14:11.167 --> 00:14:12.418
(TK yelling)

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:13.419
TK?

00:14:13.461 --> 00:14:15.838
(TK yelling)

00:14:20.301 --> 00:14:21.594
Hi.

00:14:21.635 --> 00:14:22.595
(group gasping)

00:14:22.636 --> 00:14:25.097
[Shamanmon] What's he doing?

00:14:25.139 --> 00:14:28.267
[Gravimon] Why do you
choose not to give up?

00:14:28.309 --> 00:14:29.643
Huh?

00:14:29.685 --> 00:14:32.229
Because ElDradimon
really needs to get home!

00:14:32.271 --> 00:14:33.939
And he needs our help in order

00:14:33.981 --> 00:14:35.191
for him to do that!

00:14:36.650 --> 00:14:40.112
What about those who have
no place to return to?

00:14:40.154 --> 00:14:41.781
(TK gasping)

00:14:41.822 --> 00:14:44.950
The place I called
home has perished.

00:14:44.992 --> 00:14:47.661
The same applies to many here.

00:14:47.703 --> 00:14:51.665
We all have places we can
never return to again.

00:14:51.707 --> 00:14:53.292
(group sighing)

00:14:53.334 --> 00:14:55.836
Like wishes unfulfilled.

00:14:55.878 --> 00:14:58.506
Can you imagine how cruel it is

00:14:58.547 --> 00:15:00.674
to never be able to forget that?

00:15:01.842 --> 00:15:03.344
Well, I don't wanna forget.

00:15:03.344 --> 00:15:04.678
(Gravimon gasping)

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:06.680
I also have a wish.

00:15:06.722 --> 00:15:08.557
There's a place
that I miss, too.

00:15:10.893 --> 00:15:12.520
No.

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:14.522
It's more like a moment in time.

00:15:15.523 --> 00:15:16.524
The past.

00:15:17.691 --> 00:15:20.653
But it'll never return.

00:15:20.694 --> 00:15:22.071
(TK sighing)

00:15:25.533 --> 00:15:27.535
Which is exactly why I at least

00:15:27.576 --> 00:15:30.162
wanna send ElDradimon home!

00:15:30.204 --> 00:15:32.748
Because he has a place
he can return to!

00:15:37.044 --> 00:15:38.546
(Gravimon sighing)

00:15:38.587 --> 00:15:41.257
(group sighing)

00:15:45.886 --> 00:15:48.389
(Gravimon sighing)

00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:50.724
(TK yelling)

00:15:50.766 --> 00:15:52.560
[Angemon] Gotcha!

00:15:52.601 --> 00:15:54.061
Thanks so much, Angemon.

00:15:54.103 --> 00:15:55.062
(Angemon chuckling)

00:15:55.104 --> 00:15:58.065
(Angemon gasping)

00:15:58.107 --> 00:16:00.860
(TK gasping)

00:16:05.739 --> 00:16:08.409
(wind howling)

00:16:12.746 --> 00:16:14.540
We can do this.

00:16:14.582 --> 00:16:16.584
Prepare to push, everybody!

00:16:16.584 --> 00:16:18.752
Give it your all!

00:16:18.794 --> 00:16:21.255
-Give it your all!
-Give it your all!

00:16:21.297 --> 00:16:23.591
[MetalGreymon] Say
it louder, everyone!

00:16:23.632 --> 00:16:25.092
-Give it your all!
-Give it your all!

00:16:25.467 --> 00:16:27.887
We can only do this
if we do it together!

00:16:27.928 --> 00:16:29.138
[Group] Give it your all!

00:16:30.472 --> 00:16:32.433
[Angemon] We're just
getting warmed up over here!

00:16:32.474 --> 00:16:34.768
[Group] Give it your all!

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:39.940
Give it your all!

00:16:40.816 --> 00:16:42.276
Give it your all!

00:16:45.779 --> 00:16:48.073
(thud)

00:16:48.115 --> 00:16:49.950
Give it your all!

00:16:49.950 --> 00:16:51.619
(MetalGreymon growling)

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:53.078
(Angemon growling)

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:54.747
(Leomon growling)

00:16:54.788 --> 00:16:57.833
(ElDradimon roaring)

00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:03.130
We're almost there.

00:17:03.172 --> 00:17:04.924
Keep pushing!

00:17:04.965 --> 00:17:07.301
We're sending him back home!

00:17:07.343 --> 00:17:10.304
(victorious music)

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:12.848
One last push!

00:17:14.183 --> 00:17:16.477
Now give it your all!

00:17:16.518 --> 00:17:18.812
[Group] Give it your all!

00:17:19.688 --> 00:17:22.650
(victorious music)

00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:31.367
(thud)

00:17:37.164 --> 00:17:38.666
(TK gasping)

00:17:38.707 --> 00:17:40.459
[TK] We did it!

00:17:40.501 --> 00:17:43.545
(ElDradimon roaring)

00:17:44.672 --> 00:17:45.673
It worked!

00:17:46.715 --> 00:17:48.467
-(group cheering)
-All right!

00:17:48.509 --> 00:17:49.510
We made it!

00:17:50.344 --> 00:17:52.972
[Angemon] Way to go, TK!

00:17:53.013 --> 00:17:56.183
(ElDradimon roaring)

00:17:56.225 --> 00:17:58.310
It's all thanks to you guys!

00:17:58.352 --> 00:17:59.853
Thank you, everyone!

00:17:59.853 --> 00:18:02.356
(TK yelling)

00:18:02.398 --> 00:18:05.526
(ground rumbling)

00:18:05.526 --> 00:18:07.820
(crash)

00:18:07.861 --> 00:18:10.239
(TK yelling)

00:18:11.073 --> 00:18:12.658
TK!

00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:15.244
It can't hold
ElDradimon's weight?

00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:19.665
(ElDradimon roaring)

00:18:19.707 --> 00:18:21.041
(TK yelling)

00:18:21.083 --> 00:18:22.084
TK, no!

00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:24.420
This can't be happening!

00:18:26.046 --> 00:18:31.051
-(crash)
-(ElDradimon roaring)

00:18:35.389 --> 00:18:37.891
(TK groaning)

00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:41.937
(TK gasping)

00:18:43.272 --> 00:18:46.775
(victorious violin music)

00:18:49.903 --> 00:18:52.406
(TK gasping)

00:18:52.448 --> 00:18:53.449
Gravimon?

00:18:56.744 --> 00:18:58.203
Don't tell me you were thinking

00:18:58.245 --> 00:18:59.747
about giving up back there?

00:19:03.292 --> 00:19:05.753
There's no way I'd ever give up!

00:19:09.465 --> 00:19:10.466
TK.

00:19:11.467 --> 00:19:13.093
[Angemon] Hope!

00:19:13.135 --> 00:19:15.387
Use your shining hope!

00:19:15.429 --> 00:19:16.764
(TK humming)

00:19:16.805 --> 00:19:19.808

[MagnaAngemon] We did it, TK.

I'm starting to think that maybe

00:21:21.096 --> 00:21:24.099
my Digivice isn't pointing
toward a location at all.

00:21:25.726 --> 00:21:27.227

[Izzy Voiceover] Next up on
the Digimon Encyclopedia is

00:22:43.637 --> 00:22:44.805
Gravimon.

00:22:44.846 --> 00:22:46.807
This Digimon can
manipulate gravity

00:22:46.807 --> 00:22:48.433
with its eight tentacles.

00:22:48.475 --> 00:22:51.270
Gravimon is also a tactician
full of strategies,

00:22:51.311 --> 00:22:53.313
who controls the
flow of battles.

00:22:53.355 --> 00:22:54.648
Now check this out!

00:22:54.690 --> 00:22:56.108
Controlling gravity
means you can

00:22:56.149 --> 00:22:58.151
easily carry really
heavy things around.

00:22:59.319 --> 00:23:01.113
If I could make
Kabuterimon lighter,

00:23:01.154 --> 00:23:04.324
I would carry him around on
my shoulder all the time!

(victorious music)

00:23:06.868 --> 00:23:09.371

it be next time?

[Narrator] Will Sora
and Biyomon figure out

00:23:13.041 --> 00:23:17.004
a way to calm the guardian
deity, Shakkoumon, in time?

00:23:17.004 --> 00:23:19.298
[Tai Voiceover] Next time
on "Digimon Adventure:

00:23:19.339 --> 00:23:21.174
