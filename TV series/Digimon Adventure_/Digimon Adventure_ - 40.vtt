[Narrator] This is
the mysterious world

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:45.328
where Digimon live,
the Digital World.

00:01:46.463 --> 00:01:48.965
Tai Kamiya and the rest
of the Digi-Destined

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:51.735
journey onward to a new
stage in their adventure,

00:01:51.768 --> 00:01:55.405
along with their
loyal Digimon partners

00:01:55.438 --> 00:01:57.007
and then one day...

00:01:58.275 --> 00:01:59.276
Incoming!

00:02:00.443 --> 00:02:02.746
(laughs) Can you handle
the heat, Gabumon?

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:05.315
You bet I can, crank it up!

00:02:05.348 --> 00:02:08.084
(Agumon shouts)

00:02:08.118 --> 00:02:09.119
Oh yeah.

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.255
(both exclaim)

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:13.256
Sora?

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.991
I'm ready.

00:02:15.025 --> 00:02:17.460
(Tai grunts)

00:02:19.696 --> 00:02:22.198
(Sora grunts)

00:02:25.635 --> 00:02:28.138
-Goal! (laughs)
-(whistle blows)

00:02:28.171 --> 00:02:29.606
Nice hustle, that was awesome!

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:31.308
It's only because your crosses

00:02:31.341 --> 00:02:33.176
are always so accurate, Tai.

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.278
Look alive, Agumon!

00:02:35.312 --> 00:02:36.680
Oh yeah!

00:02:36.713 --> 00:02:38.782
(Agumon exclaims)

00:02:38.815 --> 00:02:40.350
Come to mama!

00:02:40.383 --> 00:02:42.652
[Biyomon] Come on, we
can't let her score again!

00:02:42.686 --> 00:02:44.287
[Tentomon] You got that right.

00:02:44.321 --> 00:02:45.322
Incoming!

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.825
Hey, now wait a second.

00:02:48.858 --> 00:02:51.328
-Knock that off!
-(whistle blows)

00:02:51.361 --> 00:02:52.529
[Tentomon] What did I do?

00:02:52.562 --> 00:02:54.464
That was a total foul! Hands?

00:02:54.497 --> 00:02:55.465
[Tentomon] I don't have hands.

00:02:55.498 --> 00:02:56.700
It's one of the rules.

00:02:56.733 --> 00:02:58.668
You are not allowed to
hold people in soccer.

00:02:58.702 --> 00:03:01.371
[Tentomon] Wait, I thought
we were playing football.

00:03:01.404 --> 00:03:03.807
This whole soccer thing
is very complicated.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.042
You gotta keep your
eye on the ball.

00:03:06.076 --> 00:03:09.145
This means I get a free kick
from where I'm standing now.

00:03:09.179 --> 00:03:10.580
Better watch out!

00:03:11.848 --> 00:03:12.849
Here I go!

00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:18.054
-(Ikkakumon groans)
-(whistle blows)

00:03:18.088 --> 00:03:19.055
(Joe sighs)

00:03:19.089 --> 00:03:20.824
[Joe] What a pleasant sound.

00:03:20.857 --> 00:03:23.660
Where did we find a whistle
out in this wilderness?

00:03:23.693 --> 00:03:25.061
[Joe] I brought it.

00:03:25.095 --> 00:03:27.831
It was in this runaway duffel
that my brother gave me.

00:03:27.864 --> 00:03:29.332
Cool.

00:03:29.366 --> 00:03:33.236
But if one's trying to run
away, why bring a whistle?

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:36.506
Uh well, you know, you
might run into a wild bear

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:38.408
and need a way to call for help.

00:03:38.441 --> 00:03:40.176
Tai and Sora keep on winning.

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:41.411
They're a great combo.

00:03:41.444 --> 00:03:43.179
(Kari agrees)

00:03:43.213 --> 00:03:46.182
Those two are the top players
at the school soccer club.

00:03:46.216 --> 00:03:47.884
Can you tell?

00:03:47.917 --> 00:03:51.388
Their teamwork makes
them unstoppable.

00:03:51.421 --> 00:03:53.556
That ball's never
coming this way.

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.192
(whistle blows)

00:03:56.226 --> 00:03:59.562
How about we stop
and take a breather?

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.199
Feels great to get
some games in, huh?

00:04:03.233 --> 00:04:04.567
Having fun, Tai?

00:04:04.601 --> 00:04:08.872
-(Tai agrees)
-(Sora giggles)

00:04:08.905 --> 00:04:10.240
Huh?

00:04:10.273 --> 00:04:11.241
Huh?

00:04:11.274 --> 00:04:13.777
(all exclaim)

00:04:17.247 --> 00:04:18.715
(Digimon exclaim)

00:04:18.748 --> 00:04:21.985
(ominous music begins)

00:04:26.923 --> 00:04:28.224
[Sora] Well that's new.

00:04:28.258 --> 00:04:29.592
A floating island?

00:04:29.626 --> 00:04:30.627
No way.

00:04:33.163 --> 00:04:34.497
It's gigantic.

00:04:36.833 --> 00:04:40.437
Hey guys, is that
thing gonna fall on us?

00:04:46.176 --> 00:04:47.143
What are those?

00:04:47.177 --> 00:04:49.145
[Izzy] Grenades or bombs?

00:04:49.179 --> 00:04:50.413
(Joe screams)

00:04:50.447 --> 00:04:53.917
[Joe] Everybody run,
hide, take cover!

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:55.819
(object explodes)

00:04:55.852 --> 00:04:58.354
(all exclaim)

00:05:03.026 --> 00:05:04.294
What are those things?

00:05:04.327 --> 00:05:06.362
They flew down so fast.

00:05:07.697 --> 00:05:08.665
A meteor?

00:05:08.698 --> 00:05:09.866
A fallen star?

00:05:12.368 --> 00:05:14.938
Hold up. (sniffs)

00:05:14.971 --> 00:05:17.440
(sniffs) I think my
nose is telling me

00:05:17.474 --> 00:05:20.376
there's something
delicious nearby.

00:05:26.516 --> 00:05:28.184
What is it?

00:05:28.218 --> 00:05:31.020
Maybe some kind of fruit?

00:05:31.054 --> 00:05:32.455
Definitely looks like one.

00:05:32.489 --> 00:05:34.457
(Agumon sniffs)

00:05:34.491 --> 00:05:36.793
(Tai exclaims)

00:05:36.826 --> 00:05:37.861
It's yummy!

00:05:39.395 --> 00:05:41.164
[Biyomon] I wanna try some too.

00:05:41.197 --> 00:05:44.367
One measly fruit isn't enough
for everybody to share.

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.236
That's a good point.

00:05:47.403 --> 00:05:49.305
If we could get up
to that island,

00:05:49.339 --> 00:05:50.507
maybe we could find more.

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:53.209
Me and Tai are gonna bring
back a whole feast of fruit.

00:05:53.243 --> 00:05:55.044
Isn't that right, buddy?

00:05:55.078 --> 00:05:57.714
Sounds good to me, let's do it.

00:05:57.747 --> 00:05:59.215
You better count us in.

00:05:59.249 --> 00:06:01.718
[Biyomon] Biyomon
digivolve to...

00:06:01.751 --> 00:06:02.752
Birdramon!

00:06:03.753 --> 00:06:05.221
We'll be back in a bit.

00:06:05.255 --> 00:06:06.389
Catch you later!

00:06:06.422 --> 00:06:08.324
(all exclaim)

00:06:08.358 --> 00:06:09.325
[Mimi] We'll be waiting!

00:06:09.359 --> 00:06:11.928
[Palmon] And we'll be hungry!

00:06:12.862 --> 00:06:14.664
Hm? What in the...?

00:06:14.697 --> 00:06:17.066
The sky's dropping a
lot of stuff today.

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:19.669
Here's hoping this
fruit is even fruitier.

00:06:19.702 --> 00:06:20.703
Yeah!

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:28.761
(all exclaim)

00:06:38.513 --> 00:06:41.149
[All] A refrigerator?

00:06:41.182 --> 00:06:42.817
[Sora] Hit the gas, Birdramon!

00:06:42.851 --> 00:06:44.152
My stomach's rumbling.

00:06:44.185 --> 00:06:45.920
[Birdramon] Right there with ya.

00:06:45.954 --> 00:06:47.155
(Sora giggles)

00:06:47.188 --> 00:06:49.123
[Sora] Yummy,
yummy, in my tummy.

00:06:49.157 --> 00:06:50.458
-I can't wait to chow down.
-Man, someones in

00:06:50.492 --> 00:06:51.659
a good mood.

00:06:51.693 --> 00:06:54.229
I guess I am, I'm
just so pumped!

00:06:54.262 --> 00:06:56.164
It's been a while
since we played soccer.

00:06:56.197 --> 00:06:57.499
Really gets you going, huh?

00:06:57.532 --> 00:06:59.934
(Sora giggles)

00:06:59.968 --> 00:07:01.669
Yeah, it's fun.

00:07:01.703 --> 00:07:04.639
By the way, remember that game?

00:07:04.672 --> 00:07:05.707
Huh?

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:07.609
When I played forward
and you played midfielder

00:07:07.642 --> 00:07:09.010
for the very first time?

00:07:09.043 --> 00:07:11.012
We were amazing.

00:07:11.045 --> 00:07:12.847
Yeah, I remember.

00:07:12.881 --> 00:07:14.816
Talk about a flashback.

00:07:16.851 --> 00:07:19.287
I hope we can play lots
of soccer together again,

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:21.189
just like we used to.

00:07:21.222 --> 00:07:23.091
Couldn't get us
away from the field,

00:07:23.124 --> 00:07:24.792
before we came to
the Digital World.

00:07:24.826 --> 00:07:25.960
It's been way too long.

00:07:25.994 --> 00:07:28.129
From now on, we should
squeeze more practice in.

00:07:28.162 --> 00:07:29.130
Deal.

00:07:29.163 --> 00:07:31.833
(Pomumon cries)

00:07:33.001 --> 00:07:33.968
You hear that?

00:07:34.002 --> 00:07:35.904
Look, straight ahead!

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:40.308
It's a swarm.

00:07:40.341 --> 00:07:41.743
They're Flymon!

00:07:46.881 --> 00:07:49.217
-We've gotta help it!
-Help 'em, Agumon!

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:50.485
Pepper...

00:07:50.518 --> 00:07:53.521
Hold on a sec. If you do that,
you'll hit the little one too.

00:07:53.555 --> 00:07:56.057
Okay, Birdramon, take 'em down!

00:07:56.090 --> 00:08:01.095
-[Birdramon] Happy to.
-(heroic music begins)

00:08:04.933 --> 00:08:07.502
-(Birdramon exclaims)
-(Flymon screeches)

00:08:07.535 --> 00:08:10.538
(Pompumon exclaims)

00:08:16.411 --> 00:08:17.745
Hey, you okay?

00:08:21.215 --> 00:08:23.184
Please do something.

00:08:23.217 --> 00:08:25.553
Those meanies are
gonna turn my friends

00:08:25.587 --> 00:08:28.556
into fruit and
gobble them all up!

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:30.091
That's horrible!

00:08:32.293 --> 00:08:33.861
What was that?

00:08:33.895 --> 00:08:34.896
Watch out!

00:08:38.299 --> 00:08:40.868
You get hit, then you'll
melt into nothing!

00:08:40.902 --> 00:08:43.204
You be careful, okay Birdramon?

00:08:43.237 --> 00:08:45.073
[Birdramon] Will do!

00:08:47.942 --> 00:08:49.277
(Birdramon exclaims)

00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:50.912
Where is that laser coming from?

00:08:50.945 --> 00:08:51.913
It's not a laser,

00:08:51.946 --> 00:08:54.282
it's Toropiamon's
Tropical Venom attack.

00:08:54.315 --> 00:08:56.050
So it's a Digimon?

00:08:56.084 --> 00:08:57.952
(Pompumon agrees)

00:08:57.986 --> 00:09:01.489
(ominous music continues)

00:09:09.931 --> 00:09:13.001
(Birdramon exclaims)

00:09:19.507 --> 00:09:21.743
(Pompumon 2 shouts)

00:09:21.776 --> 00:09:24.278
(all exclaim)

00:09:29.817 --> 00:09:33.121
Oh wow, guess you
weren't kidding around.

00:09:33.154 --> 00:09:35.123
That's horrifying.

00:09:35.156 --> 00:09:37.458
So does this mean that
all of those fruits

00:09:37.492 --> 00:09:38.760
are actually your friends?

00:09:38.793 --> 00:09:39.761
[Pompumon] Yeah.

00:09:39.794 --> 00:09:40.962
[Agumon] Uh, they
look totally different

00:09:40.995 --> 00:09:42.230
than the one I ate
before, just saying.

00:09:42.263 --> 00:09:45.600
They took all my friends and
now I'm the only one left.

00:09:45.633 --> 00:09:47.802
What am I gonna do?

00:09:47.835 --> 00:09:49.270
All right then.

00:09:49.303 --> 00:09:53.708
Let's find a place to land
and figure out our next move.

00:09:57.045 --> 00:09:59.580
[Mimi] So what are we
gonna do with this thing?

00:09:59.614 --> 00:10:01.482
[Matt] We open it and
see what's inside.

00:10:01.516 --> 00:10:03.584
No way, that's a terrible idea!

00:10:03.618 --> 00:10:05.586
We'd be in a real
pickle if something

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:06.821
dangerous came out of there!

00:10:06.854 --> 00:10:09.190
That is a possibility,
fair point.

00:10:09.223 --> 00:10:10.591
Just relax, you guys.

00:10:10.625 --> 00:10:12.994
It's a refrigerator so I
bet it's full of treats,

00:10:13.027 --> 00:10:15.797
like more fruit or even
some ice, cold juice.

00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:17.131
Fruits and juice...

00:10:17.165 --> 00:10:18.566
That sounds good.

00:10:22.003 --> 00:10:24.505
[Tai] Whoa, it's like
a junkyard out here.

00:10:24.539 --> 00:10:25.973
Old machines like
these have been

00:10:26.007 --> 00:10:27.975
falling from the sky lately.

00:10:28.009 --> 00:10:29.210
Out of the sky?

00:10:29.243 --> 00:10:31.179
My friends and I
have been living here

00:10:31.212 --> 00:10:33.815
in peace for as long
as I can remember

00:10:33.848 --> 00:10:37.351
and then they came,
an army of Flymon

00:10:37.385 --> 00:10:39.887
with a big Toropiamon
leading the way.

00:10:39.921 --> 00:10:42.490
Next thing you knew you
were being attacked.

00:10:42.523 --> 00:10:43.491
(Pompumon agrees)

00:10:43.524 --> 00:10:45.193
They snatch every little thing

00:10:45.226 --> 00:10:47.161
they can get their claws on.

00:10:47.195 --> 00:10:49.564
They aren't any ordinary
hunters, though.

00:10:49.597 --> 00:10:51.733
I mean, you saw
what they did to us.

00:10:51.766 --> 00:10:53.034
They catch you...

00:10:53.067 --> 00:10:54.235
Once you're ripe...

00:10:54.268 --> 00:10:56.003
That's when they eat you.

00:10:56.037 --> 00:10:57.338
(Pompumon agrees)

00:10:57.371 --> 00:10:58.673
They're heartless.

00:10:58.706 --> 00:11:01.843
But still, I wanna
save everybody.

00:11:01.876 --> 00:11:03.411
This is my home.

00:11:03.444 --> 00:11:06.247
I have to take it back
from those monsters.

00:11:07.081 --> 00:11:09.350
And we'll help you, right?

00:11:09.383 --> 00:11:10.351
We all in?

00:11:10.384 --> 00:11:11.352
You know it.

00:11:11.385 --> 00:11:13.054
We'll get your
friends back for sure.

00:11:13.087 --> 00:11:15.556
They'll be sorry
they messed with you.

00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:18.459
Thank you, you
guys are the best.

00:11:20.628 --> 00:11:22.063
You ready?

00:11:22.096 --> 00:11:23.698
Always.

00:11:23.731 --> 00:11:25.733
Biyomon, digivolve to...

00:11:31.105 --> 00:11:32.106
Birdramon!

00:11:35.743 --> 00:11:38.412
[Agumon] Agumon digivolve to...

00:11:42.483 --> 00:11:43.484
Greymon!

00:11:44.952 --> 00:11:46.788
Greymon digivolve to...

00:11:52.927 --> 00:11:53.995
MetalGreymon!

00:11:56.998 --> 00:11:58.432
Okay, you ready?

00:11:58.466 --> 00:11:59.467
Yeah.

00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:11.078
I told you, fruit punch is in

00:12:11.112 --> 00:12:14.115
a totally different
category from juice!

00:12:14.148 --> 00:12:19.120
(Joe, Izzy and Mimi
speak over each other)

00:12:21.622 --> 00:12:23.257
You guys, enough!

00:12:23.291 --> 00:12:25.092
We need to calm down here, okay?

00:12:25.126 --> 00:12:27.328
I am in a perfectly
tranquil mood, mister!

00:12:27.361 --> 00:12:28.529
You calm down.

00:12:30.998 --> 00:12:34.335
[MetalGreymon] Here
we go, Giga Storm!

00:12:40.141 --> 00:12:42.043
Bullseye, great shot!

00:12:47.348 --> 00:12:48.316
(ominous music continues)

00:12:48.349 --> 00:12:49.684
Don't love that!

00:12:52.153 --> 00:12:53.554
Man, it's fast.

00:12:55.389 --> 00:12:57.558
[Birdramon] Meteor Wing!

00:13:01.829 --> 00:13:04.832
(Birdramon screams)

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:08.836
[MetalGreymon] Birdramon, no!

00:13:17.578 --> 00:13:20.848
(MetalGreymon screams)

00:13:24.685 --> 00:13:28.522
(Tai and MetalGreymon scream)

00:13:38.032 --> 00:13:40.701
(Sora whimpers)

00:13:43.905 --> 00:13:46.107
[Birdramon] MetalGreymon!

00:13:49.543 --> 00:13:50.711
Is that Tai?

00:13:56.217 --> 00:13:58.552
What did you just do to Tai?

00:13:59.921 --> 00:14:03.257
[Birdramon] Birdramon,
digivolve to...

00:14:07.128 --> 00:14:08.129
Garudamon!

00:14:09.096 --> 00:14:11.065
I don't know how
yet, but I'm gonna

00:14:11.098 --> 00:14:13.067
rescue Tai and Pompumon!

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:16.537
In the meantime, keep Toropiamon
on their toes, Garudamon!

00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:21.192
You know I will.

00:14:30.101 --> 00:14:32.837
You don't have to
carry me, I can fly.

00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:34.071
Are you sure?

00:14:34.105 --> 00:14:35.673
I know I can do it.

00:14:35.706 --> 00:14:38.743
(wings flap quickly)

00:14:44.949 --> 00:14:48.786
(Garudamon shouts repeatedly)

00:14:51.455 --> 00:14:55.893
(wings continue
flapping quickly)

00:14:55.926 --> 00:15:00.231
Okay, maybe this is tougher
than I thought it'd be.

00:15:02.466 --> 00:15:04.735
(Pompumon screams)

00:15:04.769 --> 00:15:06.437
Careful, buddy!

00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:07.471
Oof.

00:15:08.305 --> 00:15:09.540
Oof.

00:15:09.573 --> 00:15:10.541
Oof.

00:15:10.574 --> 00:15:13.210
(Pompumon groans)

00:15:13.244 --> 00:15:14.945
[Sora] Are you all right?

00:15:14.979 --> 00:15:17.448
Yeah, I'm gonna
save all my friends

00:15:17.481 --> 00:15:19.116
no matter what it takes.

00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:20.584
That's what I like to hear.

00:15:20.618 --> 00:15:22.453
Now let's get move on.

00:15:25.122 --> 00:15:26.123
It's Flymon.

00:15:27.158 --> 00:15:30.094
(Pompumon screams)

00:15:30.127 --> 00:15:32.263
There's still one left?

00:15:33.164 --> 00:15:35.266
[Garudamon] Wing Blade!

00:15:41.172 --> 00:15:42.173
What?

00:15:43.441 --> 00:15:44.442
Ah!

00:15:47.845 --> 00:15:49.480
(Garudamon groans)

00:15:49.513 --> 00:15:50.514
Hurry, Sora!

00:15:54.485 --> 00:15:56.620
I can take care of
this jerk by myself.

00:15:56.654 --> 00:15:59.090
You'd better hurry along and
find your pals right away.

00:15:59.123 --> 00:16:00.624
What? But how am I gonna-

00:16:00.658 --> 00:16:03.327
Go, I believe in you!

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:06.630
(whistle blows)

00:16:06.664 --> 00:16:07.665
Over here!

00:16:09.467 --> 00:16:13.003
(whistle blows repeatedly)

00:16:14.972 --> 00:16:18.476
(ominous music continues)

00:16:30.988 --> 00:16:31.956
You're alive!

00:16:31.989 --> 00:16:34.358
Are you the one who
saved me just now?

00:16:34.391 --> 00:16:35.359
(Pompumon agrees)

00:16:35.392 --> 00:16:36.894
Thank you so much!

00:16:38.162 --> 00:16:40.965
But now we need to save
everybody else too.

00:16:40.998 --> 00:16:42.166
Can you help me?

00:16:42.199 --> 00:16:44.702
(Pompumon 2 agrees)

00:16:44.735 --> 00:16:45.736
But uh...

00:16:46.837 --> 00:16:49.206
Being up in the
air is exhausting.

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:51.375
Tell me about it.

00:16:51.408 --> 00:16:53.511
[Garudamon] Wing Blade!

00:16:57.014 --> 00:16:59.517
(lasers fire)

00:17:19.904 --> 00:17:22.206
-[Child Tai] Here, Sora!
-(emotional music begins)

00:17:22.239 --> 00:17:23.274
On it, Tai!

00:17:25.276 --> 00:17:26.577
Oh no!

00:17:26.610 --> 00:17:29.413
What did you just do to Tai?

00:17:29.446 --> 00:17:32.383
(Child Tai groans)

00:17:34.885 --> 00:17:38.889
I'm gonna save Tai, I'll
always have his back.

00:17:41.725 --> 00:17:42.726
Ah!

00:17:43.427 --> 00:17:46.897
(Sora groans repeatedly)

00:17:51.936 --> 00:17:54.038
Hey Sora, start running!

00:17:54.071 --> 00:17:56.574
Don't think about it, just go!

00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:04.615
Just hang on Tai.

00:18:04.648 --> 00:18:06.750
This isn't over yet.

00:18:06.784 --> 00:18:07.785
Sora!

00:18:09.653 --> 00:18:10.788
I know you.

00:18:10.821 --> 00:18:13.090
You would never give up now

00:18:13.991 --> 00:18:15.492
so neither will I.

00:18:16.627 --> 00:18:19.230
(heroic music begins)

00:18:19.263 --> 00:18:23.300
[Garudamon] Sora
would never give up...

00:18:23.334 --> 00:18:26.170
There's no way,
so neither will I!

00:18:27.838 --> 00:18:32.610
(Garudamon grunts and
shouts repeatedly)

00:18:36.113 --> 00:18:37.114
Wing Blade!

00:18:44.021 --> 00:18:45.689
Tai, I've got you.

00:18:51.362 --> 00:18:53.364
[Pompumon] Rapid Seed!

00:18:59.003 --> 00:19:02.373
(heroic music continues)

00:19:07.711 --> 00:19:10.314
(Sora giggles)

00:19:11.715 --> 00:19:15.686
Look, I was able to rescue
my friends after all!

00:19:15.719 --> 00:19:17.655
And now it's my turn.

00:19:25.829 --> 00:19:27.464
What a relief.

00:19:27.498 --> 00:19:30.467
Thought we lost you there.

00:19:30.501 --> 00:19:31.669
Thanks Sora.

00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:34.805
Think it's time we
settled the score?

00:19:34.838 --> 00:19:37.007
[Sora] You know it,
hope you're ready.

00:19:37.041 --> 00:19:38.042
You bet.

00:19:44.381 --> 00:19:47.551
(MetalGraymon growls)

00:19:56.427 --> 00:19:59.396
(Toropiamon roars)

00:20:04.201 --> 00:20:06.337
We need to stop
that attack somehow.

00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:07.571
Hey.

00:20:07.604 --> 00:20:10.174
Why don't we use this?

00:20:10.207 --> 00:20:11.575
This thing? Really?

00:20:11.608 --> 00:20:12.710
Here, Sora!

00:20:16.914 --> 00:20:19.917
(Child Sora grunts)

00:20:21.285 --> 00:20:22.519
(whistle blows)

00:20:22.553 --> 00:20:24.355
I get you now!

00:20:24.388 --> 00:20:25.522
Well, let's go.

00:20:25.556 --> 00:20:26.557
Here!

00:20:28.959 --> 00:20:30.527
(Sora shouts)

00:20:30.561 --> 00:20:33.097
Now get that seed, everybody!

00:20:34.064 --> 00:20:35.766
Rapid Seed!

00:20:35.799 --> 00:20:39.136
(Pompumon's spit seeds)

00:20:46.944 --> 00:20:50.114
[MetalGreymon] That's
right, give up.
