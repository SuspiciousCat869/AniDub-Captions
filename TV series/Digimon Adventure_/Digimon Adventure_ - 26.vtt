[Narrator] This is
the mysterious world

00:01:43.373 --> 00:01:46.443
where Digimon live,
the Digital World.

00:01:47.711 --> 00:01:49.512
(whimsical music)

00:01:49.546 --> 00:01:52.015
Tai Kamiya and the rest
of the Digi-Destined

00:01:52.048 --> 00:01:53.516
continue to journey onward

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.552
to a new stage in
their adventure,

00:01:55.585 --> 00:01:58.188
along with their
partner Digimon.

00:01:58.221 --> 00:02:03.226
-(whimsical music)
-(water splashes)

00:02:05.428 --> 00:02:07.263
Meanwhile in the real world,

00:02:07.297 --> 00:02:10.366
enormous shipping vessels
everywhere fell into dangerous

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.036
and uncontrollable
patterns of movement.

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.206
The world was facing
a looming crisis.

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:18.641
Izzy worked diligently
on a counter plan.

00:02:23.313 --> 00:02:25.381
Wait a second, that's it!

00:02:25.415 --> 00:02:26.416
-Huh.
-Huh.

00:02:31.421 --> 00:02:36.326
-(air whooshing)
-(whimsical music)

00:02:42.665 --> 00:02:44.567

(OM chomping)

00:02:49.305 --> 00:02:50.306
So yummy!

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:55.578
(air whooshing)

00:02:55.612 --> 00:02:57.413
The Cloud Continent
sure looks tiny

00:02:57.447 --> 00:02:58.648
from where we are now.

00:02:59.783 --> 00:03:01.584
Who'da thunk it, ya know?

00:03:01.618 --> 00:03:03.953
That we were floating in
the air this entire time.

00:03:03.987 --> 00:03:05.789
You didn't know either, huh?

00:03:05.822 --> 00:03:08.992
Mm, and at that altitude,

00:03:09.025 --> 00:03:11.294
I think it'd even elude Peckmon.

00:03:11.327 --> 00:03:14.164
But if we can't make our
way back, then so be it.

00:03:14.197 --> 00:03:17.333
At this point we've no other
choice but to keep moving on.

00:03:17.367 --> 00:03:20.103
(CM eating)

00:03:20.136 --> 00:03:23.339
I wonder what kind of new
Digimon we'll find down here.

00:03:23.373 --> 00:03:24.841
You know what I wonder about,

00:03:24.874 --> 00:03:28.645
I wonder where in the world
ElDradimon might be taking us.

00:03:28.678 --> 00:03:29.679
Huh.

00:03:31.481 --> 00:03:36.486
-(water splashing)
-(whimsical music)

00:03:43.493 --> 00:03:46.496
That's Seadramon
and Ebidramon too!

00:03:47.697 --> 00:03:52.502
-(whimsical music)
-(Seadramon roars)

(Seadramon squeaks)

(whimsical music)

00:04:25.702 --> 00:04:27.003
What the heck?

00:04:27.036 --> 00:04:29.873
(whimsical music)

00:04:33.576 --> 00:04:35.011
Don't leave us hanging Izzy!

00:04:35.044 --> 00:04:36.212
Did you find something?

00:04:36.246 --> 00:04:39.015
Uh-huh, it's about the tankers.

00:04:39.048 --> 00:04:41.217
We might be able to
help them regain control

00:04:41.251 --> 00:04:42.719
without having to
fight the Zurumon.

00:04:42.752 --> 00:04:43.753
-Huh.
-Huh.

00:04:44.954 --> 00:04:46.856
It seems that the
source of the problem

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:48.858
is an infiltration of the AIS,

00:04:48.892 --> 00:04:51.094
or Automatic
Identification System.

00:04:51.127 --> 00:04:53.563
That system uses GPS
signals as its base

00:04:53.596 --> 00:04:55.231
to locate other ships.

00:04:55.265 --> 00:04:57.200
In other words, there's
a bug confusing it

00:04:57.233 --> 00:04:59.269
while it's reading the
ships' positional data.

00:04:59.302 --> 00:05:01.070
Once we find out
how to fix that bug

00:05:01.104 --> 00:05:02.772
so the system can do its job,

00:05:02.805 --> 00:05:05.041
then the vessels should
be clear to steer again.

00:05:05.074 --> 00:05:07.710
But they still won't be
able to use their GPS.

00:05:07.744 --> 00:05:09.612
Yeah, but look at this.

00:05:09.646 --> 00:05:11.447
(whimsical music)

00:05:11.481 --> 00:05:13.116
You're not wrong, Sora.

00:05:13.149 --> 00:05:15.551
It's true that the networks
going through the GPS

00:05:15.585 --> 00:05:17.587
are infected and unusable.

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.723
However, if we can
access the GMDSS

00:05:20.757 --> 00:05:23.393
that's installed aboard
each of the ships instead,

00:05:23.426 --> 00:05:24.627
we can send the data

00:05:24.661 --> 00:05:26.562
through a previously
used satellite network

00:05:26.596 --> 00:05:28.131
without using GPS.

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:32.302
Hold on though, what're
we sending it through?

00:05:32.335 --> 00:05:34.570
The DND what? Uh.

00:05:34.604 --> 00:05:36.739
If a ship needs to send an SOS,

00:05:36.773 --> 00:05:38.942
they use the GMDSS, also known

00:05:38.975 --> 00:05:41.244
as the Global Maritime
Distress and Safety System.

00:05:41.277 --> 00:05:42.278
Oh.

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.649
And that network should
still be safe to use, right?

00:05:46.683 --> 00:05:47.917
Right!

00:05:47.951 --> 00:05:49.919
Wow, talk about a lucky break.

00:05:49.953 --> 00:05:51.587
As long as it's
a distress signal

00:05:51.621 --> 00:05:54.257
then we can communicate with
a vessel without a hitch.

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:56.492
And that's not all,
we can correct course.

00:05:56.526 --> 00:05:59.362
These types of signals include
positional data as well.

00:06:00.496 --> 00:06:02.632
Basically, If we
manage to broadcast

00:06:02.665 --> 00:06:05.535
an old-fashioned SOS call
from a responsive ship,

00:06:06.703 --> 00:06:08.938
it should pass through
the uninfected network,

00:06:08.972 --> 00:06:10.606
beam down from the satellites,

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.776
and give accurate coordinates
to the unresponsive ships.

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:15.178
If my theory is true,

00:06:15.211 --> 00:06:18.448
any AIS in the area with buggy
information will be fixed,

00:06:18.481 --> 00:06:21.351
which should allow the
navigational systems function.

00:06:21.384 --> 00:06:24.354
That sounds great, but can
it reach all ships worldwide?

00:06:25.521 --> 00:06:27.023
Unfortunately, it can't.

00:06:27.056 --> 00:06:30.326
A distress signal will only
travel up to a certain distance.

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:31.828
But, if the ships

00:06:31.861 --> 00:06:33.830
that do receive the signal
successfully transmit it

00:06:33.863 --> 00:06:35.198
to another ship,

00:06:35.231 --> 00:06:37.000
maybe that way we
can eventually relay

00:06:37.033 --> 00:06:38.568
the signal across the world.

00:06:40.003 --> 00:06:42.505
Well, that's a longshot, but
what if it falls through.

00:06:42.538 --> 00:06:45.541
It could, but it's
our only option.

00:06:47.744 --> 00:06:50.580

It's a WaruSeadramon!

WaruSeadramon's real hungry

and he's saying that
there's lots of food here.

00:08:39.722 --> 00:08:41.457
Sure hope he doesn't mean us.

it summoned here?

You're fighting MegaSeadramon,

both of 'em are Ultimate
Digimon, so be careful.

00:09:16.159 --> 00:09:17.393
Hear that Matt?

00:09:17.426 --> 00:09:19.762
We need to get TK and
Patamon somewhere safe.

Nice, I found a fishing

in the perfect spot.

00:09:48.491 --> 00:09:49.759
I'll borrow its comm system

00:09:49.792 --> 00:09:52.461
so so we can send out
a distress signal.

00:09:52.495 --> 00:09:53.763
(signal beeping)

00:09:53.796 --> 00:09:56.165
Are those blue rings the SOS?

00:09:56.199 --> 00:09:58.000
Yes, and this vessel over here

00:09:58.034 --> 00:10:00.770
should be receiving
it any moment now.

00:10:00.803 --> 00:10:03.472

What the?

00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:08.177
The system recovered.

00:10:08.211 --> 00:10:09.812
But how?

00:10:11.514 --> 00:10:12.982
They're okay.

00:10:13.015 --> 00:10:14.650
Yeah, that's a start.

00:10:14.684 --> 00:10:16.118
You have got to see this.

00:10:16.152 --> 00:10:17.987
[Izzy] Now here is hoping
they understand our plan.

00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:20.189
So it was a distress signal?

00:10:20.223 --> 00:10:21.257
Now I see.

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:24.293
Hurry, we need to send
an SOS from our ship too.

00:10:24.327 --> 00:10:25.528
Copy that.

00:10:25.561 --> 00:10:28.331
(signal beeping)

00:10:29.398 --> 00:10:30.967
Yes, they got it.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.169
Oh, okay, I get it now.

00:10:33.202 --> 00:10:35.671
Well, here's the most
crucial part of the plan.

00:10:36.539 --> 00:10:39.342
(whimsical music)

00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:45.715
-(lightning strikes)
-(whimsical music)

00:10:45.748 --> 00:10:48.184
To minimize as much
disaster as possible,

00:10:48.217 --> 00:10:49.819
we have to stop all
the other tankers

00:10:49.852 --> 00:10:51.354
from moving right away.

00:10:51.387 --> 00:10:53.656
Really, but there's
way too of 'em.

00:10:53.689 --> 00:10:56.425
(signal beeping)

00:10:58.928 --> 00:11:01.664
Ah, come on slowpokes,
hurry it up!

00:11:01.697 --> 00:11:04.033
-Shh, hey, pipe down.
-Oh.

00:11:05.101 --> 00:11:07.870
(signal beeping)

00:11:09.538 --> 00:11:10.539
Ah, ah.

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:13.342
Please hurry guys.

00:11:13.376 --> 00:11:16.579
(whimsical music)

00:11:16.612 --> 00:11:18.914

(water splashes)

00:12:16.472 --> 00:12:17.473
Tai no.

00:12:18.341 --> 00:12:20.443
They fell into the ocean.

00:12:21.444 --> 00:12:24.180
(water bubbling)

00:12:25.348 --> 00:12:28.284

(water splashes)

00:13:07.156 --> 00:13:09.291
They're over there.

00:13:09.325 --> 00:13:12.328
(grunting)

00:13:19.502 --> 00:13:22.338

(signal beeping)

00:13:50.366 --> 00:13:53.002
Awesome, every
system's been recovered

00:13:53.035 --> 00:13:54.737
and should be working now.

00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:57.706
(signal squeaks)

00:13:57.740 --> 00:13:59.742
(digivise rings)

00:13:59.775 --> 00:14:02.411
[Garudamon] Sora, the Zurumon
are beginning to scatter.

00:14:02.445 --> 00:14:04.180
Huh.

00:14:04.213 --> 00:14:07.049
(whimsical music)

00:14:08.717 --> 00:14:10.252
We've been chasing them down.

00:14:10.286 --> 00:14:13.088
Mighty strange, where
could they be going?

00:14:13.956 --> 00:14:17.026
Huh, here's an idea,

00:14:17.059 --> 00:14:18.394
maybe they're changing locations

00:14:18.427 --> 00:14:20.362
to find a better feeding ground?

00:14:20.396 --> 00:14:21.597
What do you mean?

00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:24.099
Those Digimon all seem
to feed on data, right?

00:14:24.133 --> 00:14:27.269
So they're probably looking
for more data to eat.

00:14:27.303 --> 00:14:29.071
[MegaKabuterimon] We
got trouble, Izzy.

00:14:32.441 --> 00:14:37.446
-(lightning strikes)
-(whimsical music)

00:14:40.583 --> 00:14:42.718
There's a ton of
creepy-looking black lightning

00:14:42.751 --> 00:14:45.488
coming out of the spots where
those Zurumon were eating.

00:14:46.422 --> 00:14:47.790
I'll start looking into it.

00:14:49.592 --> 00:14:54.597
-(whimsical music)
-(substance whooshing)

00:14:59.301 --> 00:15:01.971
(air squeaking)

00:15:03.472 --> 00:15:07.243
Oh no, I've completely
lost sight of them.

00:15:07.276 --> 00:15:09.111
[Garudamon] Sorry, Sora.

00:15:09.144 --> 00:15:10.112
Don't worry about it,

00:15:10.145 --> 00:15:11.614
we're just relieved
that the ships

00:15:11.647 --> 00:15:13.415
are finally back under control.

00:15:13.449 --> 00:15:15.417
Yep, all good.

00:15:15.451 --> 00:15:16.418
(lightning strikes)

00:15:16.452 --> 00:15:17.820
[MegaKabuterimon] The
sparks they left behind

00:15:17.853 --> 00:15:19.321
are disappearing too.

00:15:19.355 --> 00:15:21.991
What could be the cause?

00:15:22.024 --> 00:15:24.326
I wonder if it's 'cause
the Zurumon disappeared?

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:26.929
Now what do you
think it is Izzy?

00:15:26.962 --> 00:15:28.097
If I had to guess,

00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:29.798
there's a chance that
this black energy

00:15:29.832 --> 00:15:31.934
was sent back into
the Digital World,

00:15:31.967 --> 00:15:33.335
just like the energy we saw

00:15:33.369 --> 00:15:34.603
when we were
fighting Calmaramon.

00:15:34.637 --> 00:15:35.804
-Huh.
-Huh.

00:15:35.838 --> 00:15:37.273
Something's brewing again,

00:15:37.306 --> 00:15:39.141
sounds like more trouble
on the other side.

00:15:39.174 --> 00:15:40.976
You mean in the Digital World?

00:15:41.010 --> 00:15:42.511
I'm worried about Matt and Tai.

00:15:42.545 --> 00:15:45.147
We should go back there and
help them as soon as we can.

00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:47.116
Uh, that isn't a bad idea,

00:15:47.149 --> 00:15:48.851
but how do we get back there?

00:15:48.884 --> 00:15:50.286
Aren't we're stuck here?

00:15:50.319 --> 00:15:51.287
(air whooshing)

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:53.022
It's calling.

00:15:53.055 --> 00:15:54.490
-Huh.
-Huh.

00:15:54.523 --> 00:15:57.192
(air whooshing)

00:15:58.394 --> 00:16:04.650

(groans)

00:17:46.685 --> 00:17:48.721
I could really go for a nap.

00:17:48.754 --> 00:17:50.089

-Oh, no!
-(creature squeaks)

00:18:05.704 --> 00:18:08.540
Did they have to summon so many?

00:18:10.275 --> 00:18:11.276
(gasp)

00:18:12.444 --> 00:18:14.380
Tai, get outta there.

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:16.281
(yells)

00:18:16.715 --> 00:18:18.584

00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:32.931
And Joe's with him.

00:18:34.233 --> 00:18:35.434
-Oh, yeah.
-Awesome.

Oops, pardon me.

00:19:53.512 --> 00:19:55.147

00:20:18.203 --> 00:20:20.339

came back for us.

00:20:23.909 --> 00:20:25.544

[Reporter] Breaking news.

00:20:42.094 --> 00:20:43.529
We have just received reports

00:20:43.562 --> 00:20:46.031
that the large vessels
clustering in critical areas

00:20:46.064 --> 00:20:48.901
have all regained their
navigational control.

00:20:48.934 --> 00:20:50.836
With this miraculous
turn of events,

00:20:50.869 --> 00:20:53.739
all U.S. aircraft have withdrawn
from the Strait of Hormuz.

00:20:53.772 --> 00:20:55.207
Excellent work everyone.

00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:57.376
[Narrator] It looks as
though any military conflict

00:20:57.409 --> 00:20:59.711
has been avoided
for the time being.

00:20:59.745 --> 00:21:03.015
However, the cause of this
incident is still unknown.

00:21:03.048 --> 00:21:04.683
Experts say, it may be tied

00:21:04.716 --> 00:21:05.684
to the recent chain

00:21:05.717 --> 00:21:08.020

network failures.

00:22:47.719 --> 00:22:50.856
He's got a husky physique
that's paw-sitively powerful,

00:22:50.889 --> 00:22:54.126
and his Vulcan's Hammer move
pounds enemies into dust.

00:22:54.159 --> 00:22:55.460
Now, let's check this out.

00:22:55.494 --> 00:22:57.863
I've heard that Zudomon's
shell is a sort of trophy

00:22:57.896 --> 00:22:59.498
that he's won off other Digimon.

00:22:59.531 --> 00:23:01.466
Do you think he has
a whole bunch of 'em?

00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:03.869
Maybe he switches them
out depending on his mood.

00:23:03.902 --> 00:23:05.804
Ooh, I should look into that.

00:23:05.837 --> 00:23:07.639
(whimsical music)

00:23:07.673 --> 00:23:09.508
Which Digimon will
it be next time?

00:23:10.742 --> 00:23:11.977
(whimsical music)

00:23:12.010 --> 00:23:13.378
[Narrator] On a
strange continent

00:23:13.412 --> 00:23:16.048
with powerful Digimon
attacking one after another,

00:23:16.081 --> 00:23:19.651
an exciting new journey for
the Digi-Destined begins.

00:23:19.685 --> 00:23:21.887
[Narrator] Next time,
to the New Continent,

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:24.256
the adventure continues
in a new world.
