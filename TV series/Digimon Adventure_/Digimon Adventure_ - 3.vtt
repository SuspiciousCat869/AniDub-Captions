[Narrator] In the
year 2020 C.E.,

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.643
the human world is
connected by a network.

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.381
That network is inhabited
by an unknown life form

00:00:23.215 --> 00:00:25.350
called Digimon.

The mysterious Digimon
that infests the Network

00:02:11.765 --> 00:02:13.633
continues to digivolve.

00:02:13.667 --> 00:02:16.236
It transforms into
a menacing figure

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:18.772
and overpowers Tai
and the others.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.309
While it goes on a rampage,

00:02:22.342 --> 00:02:25.412
a missile is heading straight
for the heart of Tokyo.

00:02:25.445 --> 00:02:27.647
At that very moment...

00:02:27.681 --> 00:02:30.617

00:02:56.042 --> 00:02:58.879

Matt.

00:03:15.896 --> 00:03:17.130
Now.

00:03:17.164 --> 00:03:18.165
Let's go!

00:03:19.733 --> 00:03:22.669
(missile rumbling)

00:03:27.874 --> 00:03:30.844
(computer beeping)

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.915
Could this be a Digimon?

00:03:37.017 --> 00:03:38.018
(Izzy gasping)

00:03:41.922 --> 00:03:45.392

(alarm ringing)

00:06:41.101 --> 00:06:43.937
(computer beeping)

00:06:47.874 --> 00:06:48.842
[Izzy] Tai!

00:06:48.875 --> 00:06:50.043
Matt!

00:06:50.076 --> 00:06:51.878
-(Tai gasping)
-Can you hear me?

00:06:51.911 --> 00:06:52.912
We copy!

00:06:53.947 --> 00:06:55.715
[Izzy] Can you see the
missile's trajectory?

00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:57.517
If we can't find
some way to stop it,

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:59.919
it's going to hit right
in the middle of the city!

00:06:59.953 --> 00:07:01.054
(Izzy growling)

00:07:01.087 --> 00:07:03.223
A black box has been
inserted into the system

00:07:03.256 --> 00:07:04.557
and it's locking us out!

00:07:04.591 --> 00:07:07.060
I can't find a way to
head off the impact!

00:07:08.561 --> 00:07:11.431
(computer beeping)

00:07:20.974 --> 00:07:22.542
(Tai gasping)

00:07:22.575 --> 00:07:23.543
There's no choice.

00:07:23.576 --> 00:07:25.211
We have to blow the missile up.

00:07:25.245 --> 00:07:26.579
That's how we stop it.

00:07:31.918 --> 00:07:33.820
If you're ready, let's do this.

00:07:36.089 --> 00:07:39.492
(dreamy orchestra music)

00:07:55.842 --> 00:07:57.944
(Izzy gasping)

00:07:57.977 --> 00:08:01.347
(dreamy orchestra music)

00:08:08.855 --> 00:08:10.490
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

(dreamy orchestra music)

00:08:31.978 --> 00:08:34.547
(Izzy gasping)

00:08:37.717 --> 00:08:40.720

00:08:55.068 --> 00:08:57.971
(Izzy sighing)

00:08:58.004 --> 00:09:00.573
(Izzy gasping)

00:09:02.342 --> 00:09:03.843
[Man 1] What's going on?

00:09:03.877 --> 00:09:06.846
[Man 2] My phone
stopped working.

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:08.648
(Izzy gasping)

00:09:08.681 --> 00:09:12.418
(triumphant orchestra music)

00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:20.393
[Woman] Everything went blank!

00:09:20.426 --> 00:09:24.197
(triumphant orchestra music)

00:09:43.416 --> 00:09:46.052
(Tai growling)

00:09:49.789 --> 00:09:51.424
(Tai yelling)

00:09:51.457 --> 00:09:54.060
(Matt yelling)

00:09:55.128 --> 00:09:57.764
(Izzy gasping)

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:06.973
(Tai gasping)

00:10:24.324 --> 00:10:27.327
(car horns honking)

00:10:28.828 --> 00:10:31.831
(cellphones ringing)

00:10:35.501 --> 00:10:36.803
Is something wrong?

00:10:39.973 --> 00:10:41.891
Everything's fine.

00:10:55.584 --> 00:10:56.619
Hello, Mom?

00:10:56.652 --> 00:10:58.220
Are you okay?

00:10:58.254 --> 00:10:59.422
I see.

00:10:59.455 --> 00:11:00.456
And Kari?

00:11:01.324 --> 00:11:02.725
Well, that's a relief.

00:11:02.758 --> 00:11:03.893
All right, you take care.

00:11:03.926 --> 00:11:05.594
I'll see you later.

00:11:05.628 --> 00:11:06.595
(Tai sighing)

00:11:06.629 --> 00:11:07.897
I'm glad you got through.

00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:09.065
How's your family?

00:11:09.098 --> 00:11:10.066
No problems.

00:11:10.099 --> 00:11:11.300
They seem to be fine.

00:11:11.334 --> 00:11:12.802
I'm just glad you
picked up my phone

00:11:12.835 --> 00:11:14.437
when I disappeared
into the network.

00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:15.438
So tell me something.

00:11:15.471 --> 00:11:17.139
How is it possible you were able

00:11:17.173 --> 00:11:18.674
to return to this reality?

00:11:20.309 --> 00:11:22.611
First, we blew the missile up.

00:11:22.645 --> 00:11:25.748
Next thing I knew, a
bright light came over us.

00:11:25.781 --> 00:11:28.150
And I was on the
station platform again.

00:11:28.184 --> 00:11:29.251
How about you?

00:11:29.285 --> 00:11:31.087
What was happening over here?

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:32.488
A lot.

00:11:32.521 --> 00:11:34.323
Once the missile was redirected,

00:11:34.357 --> 00:11:37.927
it exploded so high
up, it saved Tokyo.

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:40.796
The entire city was
spared any major damage,

00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:42.665
but when the
explosion took place,

00:11:42.698 --> 00:11:45.768
all electronic devices
stopped working for a moment.

00:11:45.801 --> 00:11:47.169
I think a phenomenon like an

00:11:47.203 --> 00:11:49.338
electromagnetic
pulse was created.

00:11:50.473 --> 00:11:52.608
This is how something
like that works.

00:11:52.641 --> 00:11:54.343
When an enormous
explosion occurs

00:11:54.377 --> 00:11:56.112
in an extremely high place,

00:11:56.145 --> 00:11:58.347
devices and data in
the immediate area

00:11:58.381 --> 00:12:00.316
are affected on some level.

00:12:00.349 --> 00:12:02.284
Normally they would
all be destroyed,

00:12:02.318 --> 00:12:05.454
but in this case, the
damages were temporary.

00:12:05.488 --> 00:12:07.523
I wonder if some
mysterious power

00:12:07.556 --> 00:12:09.959
intervened to bring
you back here.

00:12:09.992 --> 00:12:10.993
Hmm.

00:12:12.228 --> 00:12:15.030
However, the explanation
could be much more simple.

00:12:15.064 --> 00:12:16.966
Maybe the reason you
were able to return

00:12:16.999 --> 00:12:18.200
is because the
connection between

00:12:18.234 --> 00:12:20.136
this world and the
world of the Network

00:12:20.169 --> 00:12:22.204
was severed due
to the phenomenon.

00:12:22.238 --> 00:12:23.239
Hmm.

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:26.509
And then there's that
giant white Digimon

00:12:26.542 --> 00:12:28.544
you interacted with.

00:12:28.577 --> 00:12:29.845
What was that all about?

00:12:33.249 --> 00:12:36.185
Everything's a mystery when
it comes to these creatures.

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:39.989
On the plus side,
everyone seems to be safe,

00:12:40.022 --> 00:12:41.657
so I'll take that as a win.

00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:43.392
[Izzy] I like the way you think.

00:12:46.061 --> 00:12:47.496
[Tai] And just to be clear,

00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:49.665
Agumon and the others
weren't a dream, right?

00:12:49.698 --> 00:12:51.000
[Izzy] Not likely.

00:12:51.033 --> 00:12:52.501
Everything that
happened this morning

00:12:52.535 --> 00:12:54.203
is locked into my memory.

00:12:54.236 --> 00:12:56.205
It doesn't seem
like a dream to me.

00:12:57.773 --> 00:12:59.175
So weird.

00:12:59.208 --> 00:13:00.242
According to this,

00:13:00.276 --> 00:13:02.912
since you came over and
we ran out of the house,

00:13:02.945 --> 00:13:06.015
not even a full hour
has gone by yet.

00:13:06.048 --> 00:13:07.883
[Izzy] If you're
worrying about them,

00:13:07.917 --> 00:13:11.754
I'm sure Agumon, Garurumon,
and Matt are all fine.

00:13:11.787 --> 00:13:12.788
Yeah.

00:13:13.456 --> 00:13:14.924
Since I came back here,

00:13:14.957 --> 00:13:17.193
I imagine Matt
probably went back

00:13:17.226 --> 00:13:19.061
to where he's from as well.

00:13:19.094 --> 00:13:20.062
Oh!

00:13:20.095 --> 00:13:21.530
With everything
that was going on,

00:13:21.564 --> 00:13:23.432
I forgot to ask
him where he lives.

00:13:23.466 --> 00:13:25.968
[Izzy] Well, you were
focused on saving the world.

00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:31.574
What happened today has
to stay just between us.

00:13:31.607 --> 00:13:33.042
Agreed.

00:13:33.075 --> 00:13:35.578
The truth is, no one
would ever believe us,

00:13:35.611 --> 00:13:37.313
even if we swore it happened.

00:13:39.815 --> 00:13:42.051
Thank you for
everything today, Izzy.

00:13:42.084 --> 00:13:44.119
But I didn't really do anything.

00:13:44.153 --> 00:13:45.120
Come on.

00:13:45.154 --> 00:13:46.889
You're the one who
looked everything up.

00:13:46.922 --> 00:13:49.892
You backed us up, you
supported us the whole time.

00:13:49.925 --> 00:13:51.760
The fact is, you saved us.

00:13:53.162 --> 00:13:54.930
You are seriously
awesome, my dude.

00:13:57.633 --> 00:13:59.134
Thanks.

00:13:59.168 --> 00:14:01.904
I'm glad I could be
part of the adventure.

00:14:01.937 --> 00:14:04.840
(victorious music)

00:14:06.642 --> 00:14:08.611
If we get a chance
in the future,

00:14:09.111 --> 00:14:11.313
let's go visit that
world together.

00:14:11.347 --> 00:14:12.348
All right.

00:14:13.449 --> 00:14:14.817
[Tai] Wait!

00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:16.986
[Izzy] Did you forget
something, Tai?

00:14:17.019 --> 00:14:18.454
Yeah, I just remembered.

00:14:18.487 --> 00:14:20.155
Didn't you originally
wanna talk to me

00:14:20.189 --> 00:14:22.291
about that camp we're
both going to soon?

00:14:23.459 --> 00:14:24.927
[Izzy] Oh yeah.

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:26.962
[Tai] Well, we can talk
about monsters instead.

00:14:26.996 --> 00:14:29.832
-(Izzy giggling)
-(Tai giggling)

00:14:29.865 --> 00:14:31.000
[Tai's Mom] We're home!

00:14:31.033 --> 00:14:33.369
Oh boy, what a
crazy day this was!

00:14:34.136 --> 00:14:35.971
I got a call from
your dad earlier.

00:14:36.005 --> 00:14:39.108
His office was having all
kinds of computer trouble, too.

00:14:39.141 --> 00:14:40.876
Well, I'd better
get dinner going.

00:14:42.478 --> 00:14:43.646
Hey, Kari.

00:14:43.679 --> 00:14:45.314
This morning was
messed up, huh?

00:14:45.347 --> 00:14:46.382
Were you scared?

00:14:47.049 --> 00:14:48.017
Yeah.

00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:49.351
A little.

00:14:49.385 --> 00:14:50.986
You're pretty brave.

00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:52.354
So were you.

00:14:52.388 --> 00:14:53.856
Thank you for helping.

00:14:53.889 --> 00:14:54.857
Huh?

00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:56.492
(Kari giggling)

00:14:56.525 --> 00:14:58.460
Oh, Tai, I forgot to ask.

00:14:58.494 --> 00:15:00.462
Did you finish packing for camp?

00:15:00.496 --> 00:15:01.530
(Tai gasping)

00:15:01.564 --> 00:15:03.032
I forgot all about that!

00:15:04.567 --> 00:15:06.735
[Matt] So, was everything
okay over there?

00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:08.871
[T.K.] Yeah.

00:15:08.904 --> 00:15:11.974
I stayed inside all day
today, so I was fine.

00:15:12.007 --> 00:15:13.642
[Matt] Glad to hear it.

00:15:13.676 --> 00:15:14.977
That's great.

00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:16.512
You sound good.

00:15:16.545 --> 00:15:17.546
[T.K.] I am good.

00:15:18.414 --> 00:15:19.381
Hey.

00:15:19.415 --> 00:15:21.383
You know it's summer
break right now.

00:15:21.417 --> 00:15:23.986
So, can we see each other soon?

00:15:24.019 --> 00:15:25.187
[Matt] Absolutely.

00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:27.189
I'll come visit next
time I'm in Tokyo.

00:15:27.222 --> 00:15:30.025
(waves crashing)

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.996
(bright music)

00:15:34.029 --> 00:15:35.731
(Joe growling)

00:15:35.764 --> 00:15:37.166
You kids are clueless!

00:15:37.199 --> 00:15:38.567
You're not cutting the
vegetables properly,

00:15:38.601 --> 00:15:39.568
not even close!

00:15:39.602 --> 00:15:42.171
I'll show you how an
artist handles a knife!

00:15:42.204 --> 00:15:44.173
People have short memories.

00:15:44.206 --> 00:15:45.341
I mean, look around.

00:15:45.374 --> 00:15:48.177
No one's even talking about
that cyber attack anymore.

00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:51.580
And when they do talk,
their facts are all wrong.

00:15:51.614 --> 00:15:53.182
Like that missile, for instance.

00:15:53.215 --> 00:15:55.517
"It was launched in error
by the United States

00:15:55.551 --> 00:15:58.087
and quickly shot down by
their own defensive weapons."

00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:00.022
That's the latest story
circulating online

00:16:00.055 --> 00:16:02.024
and it isn't even remotely true.

00:16:02.057 --> 00:16:03.192
No kidding.

00:16:03.225 --> 00:16:05.427
Where in the world did they
even get that information?

00:16:05.461 --> 00:16:07.229
We're the ones who blew it up.

00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:09.932
I like to uncover
the real stories.

00:16:09.965 --> 00:16:10.933
They're more
interesting than the

00:16:10.966 --> 00:16:12.768
ones they put on the news.

00:16:12.801 --> 00:16:14.770
My friend, you're
full of surprises.

00:16:14.803 --> 00:16:15.738
(Joe yelling)

00:16:15.771 --> 00:16:17.206
[Joe] I cut my finger off!

00:16:17.239 --> 00:16:18.574
Somebody call an ambulance!

00:16:19.475 --> 00:16:20.909
-(Izzy yelling)
-I got ya!

00:16:25.314 --> 00:16:27.883
(Sora giggling)

00:16:27.916 --> 00:16:28.951
Hey, Sora.

00:16:28.984 --> 00:16:30.285
That was perfect timing.

00:16:30.319 --> 00:16:31.286
Here ya go.

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:33.722
Thanks so much for saving it.

00:16:33.756 --> 00:16:35.124
Wait a minute.

00:16:35.157 --> 00:16:37.626
You're Sora Takenouchi, right?

00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:38.627
Yeah.

00:16:38.661 --> 00:16:39.728
I sure am.

00:16:39.762 --> 00:16:40.796
Do you know me?

00:16:40.829 --> 00:16:41.964
Almost.

00:16:41.997 --> 00:16:44.633
The girls in my class talk
about you nearly every day.

00:16:44.667 --> 00:16:47.403
They say you're the coolest
girl in the whole school!

00:16:47.436 --> 00:16:50.072
This is Koshiro
Izumi, my new bud.

00:16:50.105 --> 00:16:52.107
But please, just call me Izzy.

00:16:52.141 --> 00:16:53.108
(Sora giggling)

00:16:53.142 --> 00:16:55.277
All right. It's nice
to meet you, Izzy.

00:16:55.310 --> 00:16:56.779
[Female Camp Member]
Come on, Sora!

00:16:58.013 --> 00:16:59.314
Coming!

00:16:59.348 --> 00:17:00.983
Guess I'll see you around.

00:17:01.016 --> 00:17:02.284
-See ya!
-Right!

00:17:02.317 --> 00:17:03.786
I knew she was the
same age as you,

00:17:03.819 --> 00:17:05.754
but I didn't know
you two were friends.

00:17:05.788 --> 00:17:08.157
Oh yeah, we go back a long way,

00:17:08.190 --> 00:17:09.458
practically since birth.

00:17:13.362 --> 00:17:14.963
Since our last adventure,

00:17:14.997 --> 00:17:18.033
I've been trying to figure
out exactly what Digimon are.

00:17:19.168 --> 00:17:21.270
One theory I read
about online says that

00:17:21.303 --> 00:17:23.338
when artificial
intelligence develops,

00:17:23.372 --> 00:17:25.174
it can evolve into a life form.

00:17:25.207 --> 00:17:26.809
You think Agumon
and the rest of them

00:17:26.842 --> 00:17:28.777
are artificial intelligence?

00:17:28.811 --> 00:17:30.312
I'm not really sure.

00:17:30.345 --> 00:17:32.114
It's one of those
mysterious questions

00:17:32.147 --> 00:17:33.649
that needs to be answered.

00:17:33.682 --> 00:17:35.117
There's something
else I think is

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:37.019
more important than that.

00:17:37.052 --> 00:17:40.155
Why was the missile
specifically targeted at Tokyo?

00:17:40.189 --> 00:17:41.957
There are no theories
posted online.

00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:44.126
People have given up
trying to figure it out.

00:17:44.159 --> 00:17:46.195
Well, I have one idea.

00:17:47.229 --> 00:17:49.031
Maybe we got in the
way of their plans,

00:17:49.064 --> 00:17:50.332
and in order to get rid of us,

00:17:50.365 --> 00:17:52.534
they were willing to
blow up the whole city.

00:17:52.568 --> 00:17:54.470
[Izzy] That's certainly
a possibility,

00:17:54.503 --> 00:17:56.805
but it doesn't answer the
most important question:

00:17:56.839 --> 00:17:58.340
What was their original goal?

00:17:58.373 --> 00:18:00.142
(engine revving)

00:18:00.175 --> 00:18:01.877
Since the Digimon
seem to be both

00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:04.813
aware of and able to
interfere with our world,

00:18:04.847 --> 00:18:06.849
I'm sure further
incidents of disruption

00:18:06.882 --> 00:18:08.817
will occur in the near future.

00:18:08.851 --> 00:18:11.186
I'm positive we haven't
seen the last of them.

00:18:12.087 --> 00:18:13.222
[Tai] Yeah.

00:18:13.255 --> 00:18:15.966
I don't think it's over either.

00:18:26.218 --> 00:18:29.254
(electronic beeping)

00:18:42.434 --> 00:18:43.402
(citizens gasping)

00:18:43.435 --> 00:18:45.571
[Woman] What's happening?

00:18:55.447 --> 00:18:56.882
[News Anchor]
Power outages have been

00:18:56.915 --> 00:18:58.584
reported once again
and are beginning to

00:18:58.617 --> 00:19:01.186
spread throughout several
areas of the city.

00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:02.421
According to sources,

00:19:02.454 --> 00:19:04.022
the origin of this
latest disruption

00:19:04.056 --> 00:19:05.724
to the grid was
found to be a failure

00:19:05.757 --> 00:19:07.593
in the power supply network.

00:19:07.626 --> 00:19:09.261
The major utilities
are trying to

00:19:09.294 --> 00:19:11.263
isolate the cause of
this latest error,

00:19:11.296 --> 00:19:13.065
but have not
released any updates.

00:19:13.098 --> 00:19:14.533
There are growing
concerns about the

00:19:14.566 --> 00:19:17.369
security and stability
of the network itself.

00:19:17.402 --> 00:19:19.104
No one in a position
of authority...

00:19:19.137 --> 00:19:21.073
[Tai] First, the
electronics went haywire

00:19:21.106 --> 00:19:23.141
and now we have power outages.

00:19:25.244 --> 00:19:28.247
(cellphone chiming)

00:19:30.749 --> 00:19:33.418
I don't know how, but I still
have a cellphone signal.

00:19:33.452 --> 00:19:35.220
(phone ringing)

00:19:35.254 --> 00:19:36.755
Here's what I've done.

00:19:36.788 --> 00:19:37.956
I made a projection.

00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:40.792
I took the specs from the
last power outage and this one

00:19:40.826 --> 00:19:43.295
and simulated what will
happen going forward.

00:19:43.328 --> 00:19:46.298
If the disruption continues
to grow at this pace,

00:19:46.331 --> 00:19:48.567
in approximately 72 hours,

00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:51.403
the city will experience
a complete blackout.

00:19:51.436 --> 00:19:53.405
I'm not talking about
just traffic signals

00:19:53.438 --> 00:19:54.606
and street lights.

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:56.808
The entire city will
cease to function.

00:19:56.842 --> 00:19:58.110
There won't be any exceptions,

00:19:58.143 --> 00:20:00.145
including the district
we both live in.

00:20:00.178 --> 00:20:01.413
