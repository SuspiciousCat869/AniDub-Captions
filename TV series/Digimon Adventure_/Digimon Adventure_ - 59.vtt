[Narrator] Guided by the
power of the eight crests,

00:01:43.472 --> 00:01:45.307
a new chapter of
the Digi-Destined's

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.209
great adventure had begun.

00:01:48.343 --> 00:01:50.445
Who knows what trials
and tribulations

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:52.347
they'll need to
face in their fight

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.649
against the Great Catastrophe?

00:01:57.886 --> 00:02:01.389
Meanwhile, the Digi-Destined
were being targeted.

00:02:02.824 --> 00:02:04.726
[Nanomon] Izzy Izumi.

00:02:08.563 --> 00:02:09.564
Izzy Izumi.

00:02:22.077 --> 00:02:24.646
[Tentomon] Who'd thought
we'd end up here?

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:26.314
Ah, memories.

00:02:26.348 --> 00:02:28.049
Yeah, something like that.

00:02:28.083 --> 00:02:29.818
(explosion)

00:02:29.851 --> 00:02:33.088
It's funny, I never thought
we'd see this place again.

00:02:34.556 --> 00:02:35.557
Huh?

00:02:36.858 --> 00:02:39.861
[Tentomon] This bedhead
is really bumming me out.

00:02:39.895 --> 00:02:40.896
Bedhead?

00:02:41.763 --> 00:02:43.665
Man, I could totally see why.

00:02:43.698 --> 00:02:44.866
(Izzy gasping)

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:45.901
-(Agumon giggling)
-[Tentomon] Agumon!

00:02:45.934 --> 00:02:47.002
Yo!

00:02:47.035 --> 00:02:48.170
What a coincidence.

00:02:48.203 --> 00:02:49.571
[Izzy] Tai!

00:02:49.604 --> 00:02:52.841
[Tai] Our destination's
been changing a lot lately.

00:02:52.874 --> 00:02:53.875
Interesting.

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:55.577
I wonder why that is.

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:56.711
[Nanomon] Izzy.

00:02:56.745 --> 00:02:58.046
[Tentomon] What happened?

00:02:58.079 --> 00:02:59.948
[Nanomon] Izzy Izumi.

00:03:01.383 --> 00:03:02.384
Izzy.

00:03:03.251 --> 00:03:07.222
-(suspenseful music)
-Izzy Izumi.

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.692
Izzy Izumi.

00:03:10.725 --> 00:03:11.927
[Tai] Show yourself!

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.195
Who are you?

00:03:13.228 --> 00:03:15.363
-(mysterious music)
-(group yelping)

00:03:15.397 --> 00:03:16.765
I am Nanomon.

00:03:16.798 --> 00:03:19.234
I am one who loves knowledge.

00:03:19.267 --> 00:03:22.537
I'm the number one expert
on knowledge among Digimon.

00:03:22.571 --> 00:03:24.206
You're the number one what?

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.107
[Tentomon] Yeah,
I don't like it.

00:03:26.141 --> 00:03:28.043
[Nanomon] You are Izzy Izumi,

00:03:28.076 --> 00:03:29.778
one who also loves knowledge.

00:03:29.811 --> 00:03:31.913
Let's you and I have a contest

00:03:31.947 --> 00:03:35.050
to see which one of us is the
greatest expert on knowledge.

00:03:35.083 --> 00:03:36.418
-Huh?
-But we-

00:03:36.451 --> 00:03:38.553
[Nanomon] You do not have
a choice in the matter!

00:03:38.587 --> 00:03:40.755
(dramatic music)

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:41.756
It's Whamon!

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.291
Wait, I know that name.

00:03:43.325 --> 00:03:44.626
That's the Digimon
you met in the

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:46.561
network before, isn't it?

00:03:46.595 --> 00:03:48.063
[Izzy] Yeah.

00:03:48.096 --> 00:03:50.298
[Nanomon] You see, I know
everything about you,

00:03:50.332 --> 00:03:51.333
Izzy Izumi.

00:03:52.167 --> 00:03:53.401
Everything.

00:03:53.435 --> 00:03:54.402
[Tentomon] Ew!

00:03:54.436 --> 00:03:55.637
Creepy!

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.306
-(metal grinding)
-(group gasping)

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:59.808
(crash)

00:03:59.841 --> 00:04:02.978
-(mysterious music)
-(Grandkuwagamon roaring)

00:04:03.011 --> 00:04:04.145
What's that?

00:04:04.179 --> 00:04:05.914
[Tentomon] Something
we should try to avoid.

00:04:05.947 --> 00:04:08.750
[Nanomon] The Mega
Digimon, Grandkuwagamon.

00:04:08.783 --> 00:04:12.153
And Whamon is about to become
Grandkuwagamon's lunch.

00:04:12.187 --> 00:04:13.955
(Izzy growling)

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:16.591
The only way for
you to free Whamon

00:04:16.625 --> 00:04:18.360
is for you to win the game.

00:04:19.527 --> 00:04:21.162
All right.
I accept.

00:04:21.196 --> 00:04:22.497
I'll play your game.

00:04:24.132 --> 00:04:25.300
[Nanomon] Very well.

00:04:25.333 --> 00:04:27.035
Then I will now
explain the rules.

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.338
If you can navigate your way

00:04:30.372 --> 00:04:34.943
through this dungeon I built,
and find me, and tag me,

00:04:34.976 --> 00:04:36.978
the victory will be yours.

00:04:37.012 --> 00:04:40.515
The time limit is 30 minutes.

00:04:40.548 --> 00:04:44.352
Along the way, there
will be riddles to solve.

00:04:44.386 --> 00:04:47.355
If you cannot solve
these riddles,

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:49.157
you will never find me.

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:50.525
(Izzy growling)

00:04:50.558 --> 00:04:53.128
Now, without further ado,

00:04:53.161 --> 00:04:54.729
let the game begin!

00:04:55.897 --> 00:04:58.667
(computer ringing)

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.702
[Computer Voice] Ride the
flowing breath of nature

00:05:00.735 --> 00:05:03.204
and proceed onwards and upwards.

00:05:03.238 --> 00:05:06.207
I assume this must be the key
to picking the right entrance.

00:05:07.742 --> 00:05:10.245
(Tai sighing)

00:05:14.416 --> 00:05:16.051
I wonder what this
flowing breath

00:05:16.084 --> 00:05:17.519
of nature could be.

00:05:17.552 --> 00:05:18.653
I got it!

00:05:18.687 --> 00:05:19.754
Look here.

00:05:19.788 --> 00:05:22.157
This is the only tunnel
with grass growing in it.

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:23.725
Hey, you're right, Tai!

00:05:23.758 --> 00:05:25.827
Sure seems like nature to me.

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.162
(Izzy gasping)

00:05:27.195 --> 00:05:28.363
What's wrong?

00:05:28.396 --> 00:05:29.831
The right and left tunnels have

00:05:29.864 --> 00:05:31.599
a slight wind
flowing through them.

00:05:32.434 --> 00:05:34.202
It's blowing out on the right

00:05:34.235 --> 00:05:35.870
and blowing in on the left.

00:05:37.405 --> 00:05:40.008
-(wind howling)
-(Tai chuckling)

00:05:40.041 --> 00:05:42.510
Maybe this wind is
the breath of nature

00:05:42.544 --> 00:05:44.746
that the riddle
is talking about.

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:47.349
If we're supposed
to ride the wind,

00:05:47.382 --> 00:05:49.918
we want the wind blowing
in, not blowing out.

00:05:49.951 --> 00:05:51.386
-So the left one!
-So the left one!

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:54.856
-(Tai giggling)
-(Izzy giggling)

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:56.191
[Nanomon] Good for you.

00:05:56.224 --> 00:06:01.229
It seems you've solved
half the riddle.

00:06:02.964 --> 00:06:04.699
(group gasping)

00:06:04.733 --> 00:06:05.800
Man, that's cold!

00:06:06.968 --> 00:06:08.703
Onward and upward.

00:06:08.737 --> 00:06:11.406
Maybe that means we have
to jump over the water.

00:06:12.607 --> 00:06:13.908
[Agumon] Well, let's go!

00:06:15.243 --> 00:06:18.213
(Tai growling)

00:06:18.246 --> 00:06:20.215
(Agumon groaning)

00:06:20.248 --> 00:06:22.217
(Izzy panting)

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:24.586
(Izzy yelping)

00:06:24.619 --> 00:06:27.255
(Izzy yelling)

00:06:32.494 --> 00:06:34.429
(alarm buzzing)
[Computer Voice] Incorrect.

00:06:34.462 --> 00:06:35.430
Huh?

00:06:35.463 --> 00:06:36.898
(metal banging)

00:06:36.931 --> 00:06:38.900
[Tentomon] Well,
that can't be good.

00:06:38.933 --> 00:06:41.736
(Izzy gasping)

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:43.304
Tai? Tai!

00:06:43.338 --> 00:06:44.572
(suspenseful music)

00:06:44.606 --> 00:06:47.609
[Nanomon] Izzy Izumi,
that was incorrect.

00:06:47.642 --> 00:06:49.144
Tai!

00:06:49.177 --> 00:06:51.579
[Nanomon] The flowing breath
of nature has two meanings.

00:06:51.613 --> 00:06:53.782
One is wind, the other is...

00:06:56.351 --> 00:06:57.652
Wait a second.

00:06:57.685 --> 00:06:58.987
[Nanomon] Yes.

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:02.290
You were supposed to
ride the flowing water

00:07:02.323 --> 00:07:04.959
and then proceed
onward and upward

00:07:04.993 --> 00:07:06.861
to a different tunnel.

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:10.932
[Izzy] So that's what it meant.

00:07:10.965 --> 00:07:12.333
[Nanomon] If you
just used your head,

00:07:12.367 --> 00:07:14.636
I'm sure you can find
the hidden meanings.

00:07:14.669 --> 00:07:17.305
But in the meantime, it looks
like I've taken the lead.

00:07:17.338 --> 00:07:18.473
(Izzy growling)

00:07:18.506 --> 00:07:20.975
Hey, what'd you do with Tai?
That's what I wanna know!

00:07:21.009 --> 00:07:23.511
[Nanomon] This is the
penalty you must pay.

00:07:23.545 --> 00:07:25.013
-Tai!
-Tai!

00:07:25.046 --> 00:07:27.515
[Nanomon] Every time
you make a mistake,

00:07:27.549 --> 00:07:29.851
I will take one of your friends.

00:07:29.884 --> 00:07:30.852
You'll what?

00:07:30.885 --> 00:07:32.353
[Nanomon] And once I have them,

00:07:32.387 --> 00:07:35.957
your friends will undergo
surgery to become Nanomon!

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:37.158
(Izzy gasping)

00:07:37.192 --> 00:07:38.193
No, Tai!

00:07:39.327 --> 00:07:40.962
You just keep going, Izzy.

00:07:40.995 --> 00:07:42.130
Don't worry about me.

00:07:42.163 --> 00:07:43.364
I'll be all right.

00:07:43.398 --> 00:07:44.866
[Nanomon] You have
20 minutes left.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.135
(Izzy gasping)

00:07:47.168 --> 00:07:48.169
[Tentomon] Come on, then.

00:07:48.203 --> 00:07:49.304
We'd better hurry!

00:07:49.337 --> 00:07:51.005
We're coming for you, buddy!

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:53.308
[Izzy Voiceover] It's my fault.

00:07:53.341 --> 00:07:54.509
I'm to blame.

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:57.103
[Tentomon] Izzy.

00:08:02.859 --> 00:08:03.860
[Izzy] Now what?

00:08:05.862 --> 00:08:07.564
[Computer Voice] On the
unlighted dance floor,

00:08:07.597 --> 00:08:10.466
a waltz at three o'clock
will reveal the path.

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:11.901
[Tentomon] That
must be about which

00:08:11.935 --> 00:08:14.204
bridge we're supposed
to choose, right?

00:08:14.237 --> 00:08:16.039
The unlighted dance floor.

00:08:16.739 --> 00:08:18.408
Well it can't be
the middle bridge

00:08:18.441 --> 00:08:20.176
because that one
is super bright.

00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:22.011
Should probably stay
away from it, actually.

00:08:22.045 --> 00:08:23.379
It seems kind of dangerous.

00:08:24.714 --> 00:08:26.249
That fire.

00:08:26.282 --> 00:08:28.418
[Tentomon] What are
you thinking, Izzy?

00:08:28.451 --> 00:08:29.452
Tentomon.

00:08:30.286 --> 00:08:32.021
Those flames.

00:08:32.055 --> 00:08:34.424
Don't they look kind of
like they're dancing?

00:08:34.457 --> 00:08:36.526
[Tentomon] Now that
you mention it.

00:08:36.559 --> 00:08:38.361
[Izzy Voiceover] Is
this the right bridge?

00:08:38.394 --> 00:08:39.596
What if I'm wrong again?

00:08:39.629 --> 00:08:42.365
[Tentomon] Well,
one way to find out!

00:08:42.398 --> 00:08:44.868
If you say this bridge
is the one, Izzy,

00:08:44.901 --> 00:08:47.203
then it must be the one!

00:08:47.237 --> 00:08:48.404
Hey, wait for me!

00:08:48.438 --> 00:08:49.606
Yeah, me too!

00:08:52.742 --> 00:08:54.077
[Group] Ready and go!

00:08:55.311 --> 00:08:58.882
-(group yelling)
-(suspenseful music)

00:08:58.915 --> 00:08:59.949
[Tentomon] Hey.

00:08:59.983 --> 00:09:01.784
This bridge isn't hot at all.

00:09:05.088 --> 00:09:07.223
Where'd the other bridges go?

00:09:07.257 --> 00:09:10.126
Those bridges in flames
were just projected images.

00:09:10.159 --> 00:09:12.629
And a projected imagine
requires a light source,

00:09:12.662 --> 00:09:14.597
so the unlighted dance floor

00:09:14.631 --> 00:09:16.299
was just another
name for the bridge

00:09:16.332 --> 00:09:17.800
that wasn't a projection!

00:09:17.834 --> 00:09:19.068
[Tentomon] Oh!

00:09:19.102 --> 00:09:21.237
I knew you'd pick the
right dance floor, Izzy.

00:09:21.271 --> 00:09:22.438
[Izzy] Yeah.

00:09:22.472 --> 00:09:25.308
But the question is,
what do we do now?

00:09:25.341 --> 00:09:26.576
-(Agumon giggling)
-(Izzy gasping)

00:09:26.609 --> 00:09:28.645
[Tentomon] Well, we
shake our groove thang!

00:09:28.678 --> 00:09:31.180
Guys, guys, this isn't
the real dance floor!

00:09:35.852 --> 00:09:38.154
It said a waltz at
three o'clock, right?

00:09:38.187 --> 00:09:39.656
I've got it!

00:09:41.291 --> 00:09:42.759
When you're giving directions,

00:09:42.792 --> 00:09:44.327
sometimes the
easiest thing to do

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:46.262
is use the face of a clock.

00:09:46.296 --> 00:09:47.997
Straight ahead is 12 o' clock

00:09:48.031 --> 00:09:49.799
and three o'clock
is to the right,

00:09:49.832 --> 00:09:52.001
so that means the right
side of the bridge.

00:09:53.136 --> 00:09:56.773
And speaking of three,
a waltz is in 3/4 time.

00:09:56.806 --> 00:09:58.007
So that means...

00:09:58.041 --> 00:10:01.044
(suspenseful music)

00:10:05.014 --> 00:10:06.182
(Agumon gasping)

00:10:06.215 --> 00:10:08.117
You hop three times
on your right foot

00:10:08.151 --> 00:10:09.285
on the right side.

00:10:09.319 --> 00:10:10.286
(computer beeping)

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.321
[Computer Voice] Correct.

00:10:12.555 --> 00:10:13.523
[Tai] All right!

00:10:13.556 --> 00:10:15.325
Way to go, Izzy.

00:10:15.358 --> 00:10:17.360
15 minutes left.

00:10:17.393 --> 00:10:20.496
(Nanomon snickering)

00:10:21.731 --> 00:10:23.466
[Computer Voice]
The last riddle.

00:10:23.499 --> 00:10:26.035
Break the endless
darkness of oneself

00:10:26.069 --> 00:10:27.704
and head into the past.

00:10:29.872 --> 00:10:30.974
Oneself.

00:10:31.007 --> 00:10:32.075
Meaning myself.

00:10:32.909 --> 00:10:34.510
What could it be?

00:10:34.544 --> 00:10:36.145
The endless darkness.

00:10:36.179 --> 00:10:38.181
I bet it's something
really dark.

00:10:38.214 --> 00:10:39.716
Something like...

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:43.052
[Izzy] Maybe that over there?

00:10:43.086 --> 00:10:45.054
[Nanomon] Izzy Izumi.

00:10:45.088 --> 00:10:47.490
It's taking you quite a
bit of time, isn't it?

00:10:47.523 --> 00:10:48.491
(Izzy gasping)

00:10:48.524 --> 00:10:50.026
(Izzy growling)

00:10:50.059 --> 00:10:52.495
Pulverize that rock over there!

00:10:52.528 --> 00:10:53.730
[Tentomon] You got it!

00:10:53.763 --> 00:10:54.931
Petit Thunder!

00:10:56.366 --> 00:10:57.700
Pepper Breath!

00:10:58.701 --> 00:11:01.337
(explosion)

00:11:01.371 --> 00:11:02.405
[Computer Voice] Incorrect.

00:11:02.438 --> 00:11:05.108
(group yelling)

00:11:08.277 --> 00:11:10.013
(Agumon groaning)

00:11:10.046 --> 00:11:13.016
Agumon, thank
goodness you're oka-

00:11:13.049 --> 00:11:14.384
Agumon!

00:11:14.417 --> 00:11:16.052
-(suspenseful music)
-Where's Tentomon?

00:11:16.085 --> 00:11:17.353
Tentomon!

00:11:17.387 --> 00:11:20.723
[Nanomon] So
pathetic, Izzy Izumi.

00:11:20.757 --> 00:11:24.260
As I said, I am the number
one expert on knowledge!

00:11:24.293 --> 00:11:25.928
(Izzy growling)

00:11:25.962 --> 00:11:28.331
Everyone's gone, because of me!

00:11:28.364 --> 00:11:30.033
[Nanomon] Why do
you waste your time

00:11:30.066 --> 00:11:31.034
with those know-nothings?

00:11:31.067 --> 00:11:32.769
Let me tell you the answer.

00:11:32.802 --> 00:11:34.103
[Izzy] Shut up!

00:11:34.137 --> 00:11:35.204
Come on, Izzy.

00:11:35.238 --> 00:11:36.606
[Nanomon] Very well.

00:11:36.639 --> 00:11:40.576
Then let me grant the
loser a special penalty.

00:11:42.979 --> 00:11:44.380
Come on!

00:11:44.414 --> 00:11:45.948
(Izzy gasping)

00:11:45.982 --> 00:11:48.451
(suspenseful music)

00:11:48.484 --> 00:11:51.120
(Izzy gasping)

00:11:52.255 --> 00:11:54.991
(chimes ringing)

00:11:56.325 --> 00:11:57.927
[Tentomon] Watch out, Izzy!

00:11:57.960 --> 00:11:58.961
[Izzy] Tentomon!

00:12:00.263 --> 00:12:01.631
(Nanomon growling)

00:12:01.664 --> 00:12:02.632
[Tentomon] Sorry about that.

00:12:02.665 --> 00:12:04.567
It was touch and go
there for awhile,

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:05.968
but Izzy, you're okay?

00:12:06.002 --> 00:12:08.337
(explosion)

00:12:09.505 --> 00:12:13.709
-(Izzy yelling)
-(Tentomon yelling)

00:12:13.743 --> 00:12:15.411
I'm gonna feel that
in the morning.

00:12:15.445 --> 00:12:16.612
[Izzy] I'm the one who's sorry.

00:12:16.646 --> 00:12:17.613
It's all my fault.

00:12:17.647 --> 00:12:18.614
[Tentomon] No.

00:12:18.648 --> 00:12:20.249
It's not your fault-

00:12:20.283 --> 00:12:22.251
It is my fault!

00:12:22.285 --> 00:12:23.753
I lost, and now, everyone is-

00:12:25.354 --> 00:12:27.757
[Tentomon] You haven't lost!

00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:29.759
You can't give up that easily!

00:12:29.792 --> 00:12:34.664
Tai, Agumon, Whamon,
everyone's waiting!

00:12:34.697 --> 00:12:36.632
They're counting on you, Izzy!

00:12:38.701 --> 00:12:39.702
Tentomon.

00:12:43.873 --> 00:12:45.641
I'll play your
game one more time.

00:12:45.675 --> 00:12:48.344
And this time, I'll solve
the riddle for sure!

00:12:48.377 --> 00:12:51.514
[Nanomon] Now that's
more like it, Izzy Izumi.

00:12:51.547 --> 00:12:52.515
Very well.

00:12:52.548 --> 00:12:54.617
I gladly accept your challenge!

00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:55.618
Let's go!

00:12:55.651 --> 00:12:56.652
[Tentomon] All right!

00:12:56.686 --> 00:12:58.654
We're back in business!

00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:01.824
Come on, guys.

00:13:01.858 --> 00:13:03.192
You can do it.

00:13:03.226 --> 00:13:04.660
[Nanomon] Well, well then.

00:13:04.694 --> 00:13:06.662
Find me if you can!

00:13:06.696 --> 00:13:08.297
[Izzy Voiceover]
Endless darkness.

00:13:08.331 --> 00:13:09.632
Oneself.

00:13:09.665 --> 00:13:11.167
The past.

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:13.836
I can't make any more mistakes.

00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:14.871
Think.

00:13:15.671 --> 00:13:16.706
Think!

00:13:16.739 --> 00:13:17.707
[Tentomon] Hey Izzy.

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:19.142
(Izzy gasping)

00:13:19.175 --> 00:13:20.643
Just relax.

00:13:20.676 --> 00:13:22.712
Think it over until
you're satisfied

00:13:22.745 --> 00:13:23.980
you've got it right.

00:13:24.013 --> 00:13:25.481
We haven't got time!

00:13:25.515 --> 00:13:28.050
[Tentomon] We'll make
up the time, by flying!

00:13:28.084 --> 00:13:30.720
My speedy wings will
take us where you want!

00:13:30.753 --> 00:13:33.022
-(Izzy giggling)
-And don't forget it!

00:13:33.055 --> 00:13:34.657
Thanks, Tentomon.

00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:36.526
(Tentomon chuckling)

00:13:45.927 --> 00:13:48.229
(splash)

00:13:48.262 --> 00:13:49.597
Wonder how deep it is.

00:13:51.265 --> 00:13:54.468
[Tentomon] My bedhead
is as bad as ever.

00:13:54.502 --> 00:13:55.670
Looks fine to me.

00:13:57.672 --> 00:14:00.141
The endless darkness of oneself.

00:14:00.174 --> 00:14:01.142
[Tentomon] What now?

00:14:01.175 --> 00:14:02.310
A mirror's not the only thing

00:14:02.343 --> 00:14:03.578
you can see yourself
reflected in.

00:14:03.611 --> 00:14:06.080
[Tentomon] What, did
you figure it out?

00:14:06.113 --> 00:14:08.449
Your reflection on
the water's surface,

00:14:08.482 --> 00:14:09.951
that's oneself.

00:14:09.984 --> 00:14:10.985
And if I...

00:14:11.018 --> 00:14:12.486
(Tentomon gasping)

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:14.322
[Tentomon] That's how
you'll break the darkness.

00:14:14.355 --> 00:14:17.558
[Izzy] I think it means we're
supposed to jump in here.

00:14:17.592 --> 00:14:18.759
But I still don't understand

00:14:18.793 --> 00:14:20.995
the second half of the riddle.

00:14:21.028 --> 00:14:23.030
[Tentomon] This is
an awfully big risk.

00:14:24.131 --> 00:14:26.000
But I believe in you, Izzy.

00:14:27.001 --> 00:14:28.936
If you say you
wanna take a gamble,

00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:30.304
then take a gamble.

00:14:30.338 --> 00:14:31.973
I'm with you to the end!

00:14:32.006 --> 00:14:33.441
You sure, Tentomon?

00:14:33.474 --> 00:14:36.277
[Computer Voice] Five
minutes remaining.

00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:37.278
Then let's do it.

00:14:37.311 --> 00:14:38.880
[Tentomon] Ready.

00:14:41.482 --> 00:14:43.284
(Izzy yelling)

00:14:43.317 --> 00:14:44.285
(splash)

00:14:44.318 --> 00:14:45.786
[Nanomon] It's not over yet!

00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:48.623
The best part of the
game is coming up!

00:14:48.656 --> 00:14:51.192
[Tentomon] Tentomon
digivolve to!

00:14:51.225 --> 00:14:53.494
[Kabuterimon] Kabuterimon!

00:14:53.527 --> 00:14:54.695
All right!

00:14:54.729 --> 00:14:56.297
We're here, Izzy!

00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:57.298
(Izzy gasping)

00:14:57.331 --> 00:14:58.499
[Izzy] Whamon!

00:14:58.532 --> 00:15:00.334
(Whamon growling)

00:15:00.368 --> 00:15:01.469
(Izzy gasping)

00:15:01.502 --> 00:15:02.737
Grandkuwagamon!

00:15:03.738 --> 00:15:06.040
(crash)

00:15:06.073 --> 00:15:09.810
(Grandkuwagamon roaring)

00:15:09.844 --> 00:15:10.845
You ready?

00:15:10.878 --> 00:15:13.214
[Kabuterimon] You know it!

00:15:16.083 --> 00:15:20.321
[Kabuterimon]
Kabuterimon digivolve to!

00:15:20.354 --> 00:15:23.491
[MegaKabuterimon]
MegaKabuterimon!

00:15:23.524 --> 00:15:25.226
(MegaKabuterimon roaring)

00:15:25.259 --> 00:15:26.360
Horn Blaster!

00:15:28.562 --> 00:15:32.099
(MegaKabuterimon growling)

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:42.043
[Nanomon] Break the
endless darkness of oneself

00:15:42.076 --> 00:15:43.911
and head into the past.

00:15:43.945 --> 00:15:45.513
Remember, in order to win,

00:15:45.546 --> 00:15:47.682
you have to find me and tag me.

00:15:47.715 --> 00:15:50.851
And you still don't
know where I am, do you?

00:15:50.885 --> 00:15:53.554
(Izzy growling)

00:15:57.224 --> 00:16:00.227
(MegaKabuterimon yelling)

00:16:00.261 --> 00:16:02.263
(crash)

00:16:05.566 --> 00:16:08.269
Whamon, don't worry, we...

00:16:08.302 --> 00:16:09.704
(Izzy gasping)

00:16:09.737 --> 00:16:12.373
(mysterious music)

00:16:12.406 --> 00:16:14.108
My own reflection.

00:16:14.141 --> 00:16:15.876
Endless darkness.

00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:17.378
(Izzy gasping)

00:16:17.411 --> 00:16:18.412
The past!

00:16:19.447 --> 00:16:22.249
(sad horn music)

00:16:24.085 --> 00:16:27.555
[MegaKabuterimon] Izzy,
what did you discover?

00:16:27.588 --> 00:16:29.056
It just came to me.

00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:32.226
So far, all of the riddles
have had two meanings.

00:16:32.259 --> 00:16:35.730
The flowing breath of
nature was wind and water.

00:16:35.763 --> 00:16:37.231
The lightless
dance floor was the

00:16:37.264 --> 00:16:39.900
projection of
flames and bridges.

00:16:39.934 --> 00:16:43.637
And the endless
darkness of oneself

00:16:43.671 --> 00:16:47.408
is my reflection on the
water and something else.

00:16:47.441 --> 00:16:49.243
A place that only we would know

00:16:49.276 --> 00:16:51.278
because we were
there in the past!

00:16:52.279 --> 00:16:53.481
[MegaKabuterimon] So,
you've figured out

00:16:53.514 --> 00:16:55.282
Nanomon's location.

00:16:56.350 --> 00:16:57.918
Nicely done.

00:16:57.952 --> 00:16:59.620
Whatever you decide, Izzy,

00:16:59.653 --> 00:17:02.156
I'll do anything to help.

00:17:02.189 --> 00:17:03.691
MegaKabuterimon.

00:17:06.527 --> 00:17:08.429
Because you were there for me,

00:17:08.462 --> 00:17:11.132
I was able to believe in myself!

00:17:11.165 --> 00:17:13.501
With a friend like
you by my side,

00:17:13.534 --> 00:17:15.169
I can do anything!

00:17:15.202 --> 00:17:16.303
[MegaKabuterimon] That's right.

00:17:16.337 --> 00:17:17.938
And when Izzy's knowledge and

00:17:17.972 --> 00:17:21.375
my powers are combined,
we're invincible!

00:17:22.977 --> 00:17:24.278
(Grandkuwagamon growling)

00:17:24.311 --> 00:17:28.516
[MegaKabuterimon]
MegaKabuterimon digivolve to!

00:17:28.549 --> 00:17:31.552
(upbeat rock music)

00:17:34.221 --> 00:17:37.892
[HerculesKabuterimon]
HerculesKabuterimon!

00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:42.363
Izzy, the power of your
bold and strong will

00:17:42.396 --> 00:17:44.165
has touched my heart!

00:17:45.166 --> 00:17:47.034
(HerculesKabuterimon growling)

00:17:47.068 --> 00:17:49.336
The game is just beginning.

00:17:51.672 --> 00:17:54.075
[Izzy] HerculesKabuterimon!

00:17:56.744 --> 00:17:59.814
[HerculesKabuterimon]
Yes, I see.

00:17:59.847 --> 00:18:02.249
In that case, I have an idea.

00:18:03.884 --> 00:18:05.186
[Tai] Yeah, Izzy!

00:18:05.219 --> 00:18:07.054
[Agumon] Go, go!

00:18:07.088 --> 00:18:08.556
[Nanomon] What?

00:18:08.589 --> 00:18:10.825
(Nanomon yelling)

00:18:10.858 --> 00:18:13.060
(Nanomon gasping)

00:18:13.094 --> 00:18:15.229
[Agumon] Whamon's on fire!

00:18:15.262 --> 00:18:16.664
[Nanomon] But how?

00:18:16.697 --> 00:18:18.866
What is going on out there?

00:18:18.899 --> 00:18:21.902
(upbeat rock music)

00:18:23.871 --> 00:18:26.340
[Izzy] Do it,
HerculesKabuterimon!

00:18:26.373 --> 00:18:27.842
(HerculesKabuterimon
laughing evilly)

00:18:27.875 --> 00:18:30.411
[HerculesKabuterimon] Let's
burn it all to the ground!

00:18:30.444 --> 00:18:33.414
[Nanomon] Izzy Izumi's
attacking his friends?

00:18:33.447 --> 00:18:34.915
But why?

00:18:34.949 --> 00:18:37.952
(upbeat rock music)

00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:40.387
What?

00:18:40.421 --> 00:18:42.089
The fire was a fake!

00:18:44.291 --> 00:18:45.559
[HerculesKabuterimon]
That's right!

00:18:45.593 --> 00:18:47.895
And you totally fell for it!

00:18:48.896 --> 00:18:50.364
(Nanomon groaning)

00:18:50.397 --> 00:18:51.398
[Izzy] I knew it!

00:18:51.432 --> 00:18:53.400
You were inside Whamon!

00:18:55.236 --> 00:18:56.871
[Nanomon] But how?

00:18:56.904 --> 00:18:58.105
I saw the fire!

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:00.741
[Izzy] What you saw was footage

00:19:00.774 --> 00:19:02.510
of those flames at the bridge,

00:19:02.543 --> 00:19:03.944
repurposed to make it look like

00:19:03.978 --> 00:19:06.080
Whamon was on fire.

00:19:06.113 --> 00:19:07.548
[HerculesKabuterimon]
I came up with the idea

00:19:07.581 --> 00:19:09.617
of luring you out of
your hiding place,

00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:11.952
and Izzy made it happen.

00:19:11.986 --> 00:19:14.388
It was a trap created
by the both of us!

00:19:14.421 --> 00:19:17.324
(Nanomon growling)

00:19:21.595 --> 00:19:23.797
Go, HerculesKabuterimon!

00:19:23.831 --> 00:19:25.966
(HerculesKabuterimon roaring)

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:31.005
-(HerculesKabuterimon growling)
-(upbeat rock music)

00:19:31.805 --> 00:19:32.773
[Nanomon] That's impossible!

00:19:32.806 --> 00:19:34.308
I can never lose!

00:19:34.341 --> 00:19:35.476
Never!

00:19:35.509 --> 00:19:37.244
(Nanomon gasping)

00:19:37.278 --> 00:19:40.281
(upbeat rock music)

00:19:42.183 --> 00:19:44.652
[HerculesKabuterimon] Take this!

00:19:44.685 --> 00:19:45.786
Giga Blaster!

00:19:48.022 --> 00:19:50.858
(Nanomon yelling)

00:19:58.465 --> 00:20:01.969
Believe me, I can understand
your love for knowledge.

00:20:03.971 --> 00:20:07.675
But using that knowledge to
hurt others is just wrong.

00:20:07.708 --> 00:20:09.343
And this time, I win.

00:20:09.376 --> 00:20:10.377
Game over.

00:20:12.313 --> 00:20:15.382
(bright piano music)

00:20:17.718 --> 00:20:22.122
-(Izzy chuckling)
-(HerculesKabuterimon giggling)

00:20:22.156 --> 00:20:23.490
Whoa.

00:20:23.524 --> 00:20:25.559
What are they doing here?

00:20:28.395 --> 00:20:29.396
Hey!

00:20:32.533 --> 00:20:35.402
(Nanomon groaning)

00:20:36.837 --> 00:20:37.805
[Nanomon] Wow!

00:20:37.838 --> 00:20:40.007
It's Izzy Izumi in person!

00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:41.809
I'm so excited to meet you!

00:20:41.842 --> 00:20:44.044
You can call me Nanomon.

00:20:44.078 --> 00:20:46.213
[Tentomon] Well there's
a personality change.

00:20:46.247 --> 00:20:47.481
[Nanomon] How thrilling!

00:20:47.514 --> 00:20:49.717
Ever since I heard about
you from Garbagemon,

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:51.685
I've been so looking
forward to meeting you.

00:20:51.719 --> 00:20:52.686
[Izzy] Wait.

00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:53.721
You know Garbagemon?

00:20:54.855 --> 00:20:55.823
[Nanomon] Sure!

00:20:55.856 --> 00:20:57.091
We're research buddies.

00:20:58.259 --> 00:21:03.030
But by the way, where
am I and why am I here?

00:21:03.897 --> 00:21:05.532
Someone must've manipulated him.

00:21:05.566 --> 00:21:06.834
[Izzy] Huh?

00:21:06.867 --> 00:21:09.737
I saw Soundbirdmon
fly away just now.

00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:10.738
[Tentomon] Say what?

00:21:10.771 --> 00:21:13.073
And we know that Soundbirdmon

00:21:13.107 --> 00:21:15.075
were Devimon's minions.

00:21:15.109 --> 00:21:17.578
But Devimon is gone now, right?

00:21:17.611 --> 00:21:21.181
Still, those Soundbirdmon
were able to manipulate Digi-

00:21:21.215 --> 00:21:23.250
[Nanomon] Izzy Izumi, come on!

00:21:23.284 --> 00:21:25.352
Come and play a game with me!

00:21:25.386 --> 00:21:26.587
(Izzy giggling)

00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:29.556
I've played enough
games for today.

(digivice beeping)

00:21:32.559 --> 00:21:34.194

Despite my tough body,

my wings are pretty thin,

as hard as I can.

a safe ride, Izzy!
