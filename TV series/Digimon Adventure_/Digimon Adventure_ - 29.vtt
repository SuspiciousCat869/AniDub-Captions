[Narrator] This is
the mysterious world

00:01:42.058 --> 00:01:43.826
where Digimon live.

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:45.328
The Digital World.

00:01:46.495 --> 00:01:48.698
Tai Kamiya and the
other Digi-destined,

00:01:48.731 --> 00:01:50.800
along with their
partner Digimon,

00:01:50.833 --> 00:01:52.301
continue their adventure

00:01:52.335 --> 00:01:55.671
and find themselves
in a whole new world.

00:01:55.705 --> 00:01:57.707
(missile firing)

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.042
The friends have become
separated from each other

00:02:00.076 --> 00:02:02.345
on this mysterious
new continent.

00:02:06.916 --> 00:02:08.184
(rocket exploding)

00:02:08.217 --> 00:02:09.652
In the real world,

00:02:09.685 --> 00:02:12.822
the rocket explosion
created confusion online,

00:02:12.855 --> 00:02:16.826
and this confusion supplied
power to some vicious Digimon,

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:19.362
that then turned
that power on Tai.

00:02:21.097 --> 00:02:24.000
(thudding sound)

00:02:24.033 --> 00:02:25.668

(cloth rustling)

00:02:27.403 --> 00:02:29.572
Then, to make
matters even worse,

00:02:29.605 --> 00:02:33.109
Kari was carried off by the
mysterious SkullKnightmon.

00:02:34.777 --> 00:02:37.446
(air whooshing)

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:40.950
Kari!

00:02:41.617 --> 00:02:43.419
(Tai gasping)

00:02:43.452 --> 00:02:46.122
(air whooshing)

00:02:49.558 --> 00:02:50.559
Kari!

00:02:55.631 --> 00:02:56.866
(footsteps pattering)

00:02:56.899 --> 00:03:00.536
(Tai and Agumon panting)

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:01.570
Kari!

00:03:02.972 --> 00:03:04.273
Kari, I'm coming!

00:03:04.307 --> 00:03:07.109
(thudding sound)

00:03:07.977 --> 00:03:11.380
(Tai grunting)

00:03:11.414 --> 00:03:13.749
(footsteps thudding)

00:03:13.783 --> 00:03:14.784
Hey, Tai.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.789
Come on, Tai, get up!

00:03:19.822 --> 00:03:21.457
Get on your feet, come on!

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:24.226
If you give up, who's
gonna save Kari?

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.796
(Tai grunting)

00:03:33.502 --> 00:03:36.238
Hey, thanks, Agumon.

00:03:36.272 --> 00:03:37.506
Any time, Tai.

00:03:38.441 --> 00:03:40.576
(gentle music)

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:41.977
[Tai] Listen up, everyone.

00:03:43.112 --> 00:03:45.648
Kari was just taken
away by SkullKnightmon.

00:03:46.816 --> 00:03:48.084
Kari was what?

00:03:48.117 --> 00:03:49.085
(footsteps pattering)

00:03:49.118 --> 00:03:50.486
SkullKnightmon?

00:03:51.954 --> 00:03:52.922
No way!

00:03:52.955 --> 00:03:54.023
He's still alive?

00:03:55.491 --> 00:03:58.094
[Sora] Tai, are
you guys all right?

00:03:58.127 --> 00:04:00.963
Yeah, Agumon and I are fine.

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:06.702
But right now, I'm
going after Kari.

00:04:07.536 --> 00:04:08.971
We understand.

00:04:09.004 --> 00:04:10.973
Just be careful out there.

00:04:11.006 --> 00:04:12.975
[Tai] I will, thanks.

00:04:13.008 --> 00:04:14.076
In the meantime,

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.846
I'm gonna continue investigating
that rocket incident.

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:19.949
Oh, oh! Don't forget
about meeting up, Izzy.

00:04:19.982 --> 00:04:21.317
[Izzy] That's right.

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:23.986
We all need to find each
other as soon as possible.

00:04:24.019 --> 00:04:26.355
Joe, Mimi, that
goes for you too.

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:27.390
Roger!

00:04:28.557 --> 00:04:29.558
Yeah.

00:04:30.226 --> 00:04:32.862
(gentle music)

00:04:34.563 --> 00:04:37.400
[Matt] Tai, I'm sure she's okay.

00:04:38.667 --> 00:04:40.302
[T.K.] I'm going to fight too.

00:04:40.336 --> 00:04:43.205
So Tai, please fight for Kari.

00:04:43.239 --> 00:04:47.543
Thanks, I sure will.

00:04:48.411 --> 00:04:50.513
Agumon, let's go.

00:04:50.546 --> 00:04:51.881
Right!

00:04:51.914 --> 00:04:55.084
(footsteps pattering)

00:04:56.919 --> 00:04:59.588
(ominous music)

00:05:09.532 --> 00:05:11.500
(missile firing)

00:05:11.534 --> 00:05:12.701
(missile exploding)

00:05:12.735 --> 00:05:14.737
(missile firing)

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:17.773
(missile exploding)

00:05:21.277 --> 00:05:23.679
(suspenseful music)

00:05:23.712 --> 00:05:26.582
(Allomon growling)

00:05:26.615 --> 00:05:29.618
(suspenseful music)

00:05:30.786 --> 00:05:34.223
(grinding sound)

00:05:34.256 --> 00:05:37.092
(melodic music)

00:05:37.126 --> 00:05:39.361
(footsteps pattering)

00:05:39.395 --> 00:05:41.430
(Agumon panting)

00:05:41.464 --> 00:05:43.098
(Agumon gasping)

00:05:43.132 --> 00:05:44.233
What is it?

00:05:45.901 --> 00:05:48.237
I think there's somebody nearby.

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:49.472
Why do you think that?

00:05:53.576 --> 00:05:54.944
(Agumon screaming)

00:05:54.977 --> 00:05:56.245
What is it?

00:05:56.278 --> 00:05:58.781
(eerie music)

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:03.118
Tai.

00:06:03.152 --> 00:06:06.088
(Woodmon growling)

00:06:07.156 --> 00:06:10.559
(leaves rustling)

00:06:10.593 --> 00:06:13.395
(footsteps thudding)

00:06:13.429 --> 00:06:16.632
(Woodmon moaning)

00:06:16.665 --> 00:06:19.768
Are you here to
destroy our forest?

00:06:19.802 --> 00:06:21.270
No, of course not.

00:06:21.303 --> 00:06:23.138
We would never do that.

00:06:23.172 --> 00:06:26.475
We're just looking for my
little sister, that's all.

00:06:26.509 --> 00:06:28.744
Little sister?

00:06:28.777 --> 00:06:30.312
She's a human girl

00:06:30.346 --> 00:06:33.749
and she was kidnapped by a
Digimon with black armor.

00:06:33.782 --> 00:06:34.783
Have you seen her?

00:06:35.951 --> 00:06:38.654
(Woodmon grunting)

00:06:38.687 --> 00:06:39.688
I see.

00:06:40.523 --> 00:06:41.924
(missile exploding)

00:06:41.957 --> 00:06:43.325
(all gasping)

00:06:43.359 --> 00:06:44.994
What's that sound?

00:06:45.027 --> 00:06:46.095
Hunters.

00:06:46.128 --> 00:06:47.496
Hunters?

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:48.797
What are they hunting?

00:06:50.199 --> 00:06:53.802
We are those who only
wish to live in peace.

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:57.773
However, as you may
have already witnessed,

00:06:57.806 --> 00:07:00.476
this is a world where the
strong feed on the weak.

00:07:02.177 --> 00:07:03.779
(Tai gasping)

00:07:03.812 --> 00:07:06.815
(suspenseful music)

00:07:09.385 --> 00:07:11.987
(crunching sound)

00:07:12.021 --> 00:07:13.956
To compete for survival,

00:07:13.989 --> 00:07:16.659
they will pursue their prey
to the ends of the world.

00:07:18.327 --> 00:07:20.696
Now, even to this forest.

00:07:20.729 --> 00:07:23.198
(all gasping)

00:07:23.232 --> 00:07:24.700
(suspenseful music)

00:07:24.733 --> 00:07:26.168
(Tai gasping)

00:07:26.201 --> 00:07:29.805
(missile exploding)

00:07:29.838 --> 00:07:32.841
(suspenseful music)

00:07:34.843 --> 00:07:36.812
They've cut off
our escape route!

00:07:36.845 --> 00:07:40.549
We'll need to find
another way out.

00:07:40.583 --> 00:07:42.885
(missile exploding)

00:07:42.918 --> 00:07:45.721
(suspenseful music)

00:07:45.754 --> 00:07:47.690
(Tai gasping)

00:07:47.723 --> 00:07:50.225
(Allomon growling)

00:07:50.259 --> 00:07:51.260
Allomon!

00:07:52.027 --> 00:07:55.331
(suspenseful music)

00:07:55.364 --> 00:07:58.400
It looks like they haven't
destroyed this path yet.

00:07:58.434 --> 00:08:02.404
Quick, we can get out
this way. (panting)

00:08:02.438 --> 00:08:05.007
(all panting)

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:08.043
(suspenseful music)

00:08:11.447 --> 00:08:14.249
(fire crackling)

00:08:14.283 --> 00:08:17.286
(suspenseful music)

00:08:24.893 --> 00:08:27.396
(Tai panting)

00:08:29.064 --> 00:08:30.399
Hey, are you all right?

00:08:30.432 --> 00:08:32.534
Let's get outta here. (panting)

00:08:32.568 --> 00:08:34.703
(footsteps pattering)

00:08:34.737 --> 00:08:37.406
(feet skidding)

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:41.043
We Woodmon will stand and fight.

00:08:41.076 --> 00:08:44.446
At least long enough for
the others to get away.

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:45.614
(footsteps thudding)

00:08:45.648 --> 00:08:48.584
(Allomon growling)

00:08:49.418 --> 00:08:51.120
(Woodmon yelling)

00:08:51.153 --> 00:08:54.056
(fire blazing)

00:08:54.089 --> 00:08:57.559
(Woodmon screaming)

00:08:57.593 --> 00:09:00.496
(Woodmon grunting)

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:07.569
(shattering sound)

00:09:07.603 --> 00:09:10.906
(Allomon roaring)

00:09:10.939 --> 00:09:12.241
(Tai gasping)

00:09:12.274 --> 00:09:13.575
Well, Tai?

00:09:13.609 --> 00:09:15.444
Yeah, let's do it!

00:09:15.477 --> 00:09:18.480
(fantastical music)

00:09:32.695 --> 00:09:34.697
Agumon digivolve to...

00:09:36.532 --> 00:09:39.535
(fantastical music)

00:09:50.045 --> 00:09:51.046
Greymon!

00:09:52.381 --> 00:09:55.517
(fantastical music)

00:09:55.551 --> 00:09:56.552
Nova Blast!

00:10:00.322 --> 00:10:02.024
(Allomon growling)

00:10:02.057 --> 00:10:03.158
Now's our chance.

00:10:03.192 --> 00:10:04.159
This way!

00:10:04.193 --> 00:10:06.704
(footsteps pattering)

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:14.303
(bright music)

00:10:14.336 --> 00:10:17.506
(footsteps thudding)

00:10:17.539 --> 00:10:18.507
[Izzy] Izzy here.

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:19.842
Can everyone hear me?

00:10:19.875 --> 00:10:23.011
Come in.

00:10:23.045 --> 00:10:26.115
[Tentomon] Can we have your
attention please, everyone?

00:10:26.148 --> 00:10:27.616
[Matt] What's up?

00:10:27.649 --> 00:10:30.185
[Izzy] It hasn't been
announced to the public yet,

00:10:30.219 --> 00:10:33.355
but I've found several
small but significant bugs

00:10:33.388 --> 00:10:35.624
within the space-related
control systems

00:10:35.657 --> 00:10:37.659
in a few different countries.

00:10:37.693 --> 00:10:39.194
(Matt gasping)

00:10:39.228 --> 00:10:41.163
Yeah, but what does that mean?

00:10:42.564 --> 00:10:45.534
Currently, there are more than
4,000 artificial satellites

00:10:45.567 --> 00:10:46.735
orbiting the Earth.

00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:50.639
It seems that with
a few of them,

00:10:50.672 --> 00:10:52.341
there's been some
sort of orbital shift

00:10:52.374 --> 00:10:55.344
caused by a malfunction
in their control system.

00:10:55.377 --> 00:10:58.347
[Matt] So, are you saying these
satellites are gonna fall?

00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:01.150
No, not on account of
this problem anyway.

00:11:01.183 --> 00:11:04.052
It wouldn't make them
fall out of the sky.

00:11:04.086 --> 00:11:05.554
Even if they did,

00:11:05.587 --> 00:11:08.490
they'd just burn up in the
Earth's atmosphere first.

00:11:08.524 --> 00:11:11.393
They'd have no effect
on the planet's surface.

00:11:11.426 --> 00:11:14.363
[Sora] So then, there's
no problem, right?

00:11:14.396 --> 00:11:15.497
[Izzy] Exactly.

00:11:15.531 --> 00:11:17.099
And that's what worries me.

00:11:19.368 --> 00:11:22.404
All the confusion online
caused by the rocket explosion

00:11:22.437 --> 00:11:24.373
is starting to die down as well.

00:11:25.707 --> 00:11:27.543
I have a feeling
this might only be

00:11:27.576 --> 00:11:29.244
the calm before the storm.

00:11:31.046 --> 00:11:32.347
I get it.

00:11:32.381 --> 00:11:35.284
You just keep on
investigating it, okay, Izzy?

00:11:36.385 --> 00:11:37.619
[Izzy] You got it, Matt!

00:11:38.554 --> 00:11:40.422
(footsteps pattering)

00:11:40.455 --> 00:11:42.357
Well, I guess it's
time we got going

00:11:42.391 --> 00:11:44.293
and tried to meet
up with the others.

00:11:45.394 --> 00:11:46.361
Oh, wow!

00:11:46.395 --> 00:11:48.130
We got lotsa souvenirs!

00:11:49.264 --> 00:11:51.266
We'll wrap this
mission up quickly,

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:53.235
then we'll start
turning these gemstones

00:11:53.268 --> 00:11:55.737
into tons of
fabulous accessories!

00:11:56.605 --> 00:11:58.607
Oh, I can hardly wait!

00:11:59.474 --> 00:12:01.944
Joe, shouldn't we get a move on?

00:12:01.977 --> 00:12:03.712
We should, you're right,

00:12:03.745 --> 00:12:05.547
and I would love to,

00:12:05.581 --> 00:12:09.785
but I'm a little woozy
from the heat. (gurgling)

00:12:10.652 --> 00:12:11.653
[Gomamon] Joe.

00:12:12.821 --> 00:12:14.723
(air whooshing)

00:12:14.756 --> 00:12:16.391
Ready, Birdramon?

00:12:16.425 --> 00:12:17.426
Okay.

00:12:17.459 --> 00:12:19.628
(air whooshing)

00:12:19.661 --> 00:12:22.064
(fire roaring)

00:12:22.097 --> 00:12:25.100
(suspenseful music)

00:12:29.771 --> 00:12:32.307
(missile exploding)

00:12:32.341 --> 00:12:34.243
(bouncing sound)

00:12:34.276 --> 00:12:37.179
(suspenseful music)

00:12:45.621 --> 00:12:48.657
(Tankdramon rumbling)

00:12:52.694 --> 00:12:53.829
Nova Blast!

00:12:54.796 --> 00:12:56.832
(flame blasting)

00:12:56.865 --> 00:12:59.868
(suspenseful music)

00:13:04.139 --> 00:13:07.309
(footsteps thudding)

00:13:13.882 --> 00:13:15.817
That's the boss, huh?

00:13:15.851 --> 00:13:18.520
(suspenseful music)

00:13:18.553 --> 00:13:20.188
(Greymon grunting)

00:13:20.222 --> 00:13:21.857

(Greymon grunting)

00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:31.500
(fire roaring)

00:13:31.533 --> 00:13:32.634
Whoa, Greymon!

00:13:32.668 --> 00:13:33.802
Incoming!

00:13:33.835 --> 00:13:36.838
(suspenseful music)

00:13:38.573 --> 00:13:39.641
(missile firing)

00:13:39.675 --> 00:13:40.976
Megadramon!

00:13:41.009 --> 00:13:42.878
(suspenseful music)

00:13:42.911 --> 00:13:44.346

00:13:52.187 --> 00:13:55.190
(suspenseful music)

00:13:56.692 --> 00:13:57.826
All right, Greymon.

00:13:57.859 --> 00:13:58.860
(Greymon grunting)

00:13:58.894 --> 00:13:59.861

(fantastical music)

00:14:46.074 --> 00:14:47.075
MetalGreymon!

00:14:49.444 --> 00:14:50.445

Let's fly.

I'm not gonna lose.

00:17:09.401 --> 00:17:11.369
Not here, not now.

00:17:11.403 --> 00:17:14.739

I'm here, Sora.

00:18:17.235 --> 00:18:19.271
[Sora] Didn't I
say I owed you one?

00:18:19.304 --> 00:18:20.305
Thanks!

00:18:21.072 --> 00:18:22.440
The fire's out for now.

00:18:22.474 --> 00:18:24.409

MetalGreymon, fire missiles.

00:20:12.083 --> 00:20:14.085
Aim for the main cannon.

00:20:15.253 --> 00:20:16.554

SkullKnightmon, a mysterious
Digimon encased in black armor,

00:22:47.739 --> 00:22:49.007
SkullKnightmon
corners an opponent

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:51.509
by wielding spears
in both hands.

00:22:51.543 --> 00:22:53.211
Now, let's check this out.

00:22:53.244 --> 00:22:56.214
There's not a lot of data to
work with, so I asked around,

00:22:56.247 --> 00:22:57.715
and Tentomon told me he thinks

00:22:57.749 --> 00:23:00.185
SkullKnightmon's probably
very competitive,

00:23:00.218 --> 00:23:02.520
but also surprisingly sensitive.

00:23:02.554 --> 00:23:03.721
I wonder if that's true.

their courage and heart
awaken a great power.
