[Narrator] This is
the mysterious world

00:01:42.397 --> 00:01:43.431
where Digimon live.

00:01:44.265 --> 00:01:45.266
The Digital World.

00:01:46.467 --> 00:01:48.703
Tai, Kari, and the
other Digi-destined,

00:01:48.736 --> 00:01:50.872
alongside their
Digimon partners,

00:01:50.905 --> 00:01:53.441
head to a new stage
in their adventure.

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:58.046
On a continent where only
the strong can survive,

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.548
Tai and Agumon are
plunged into a battle

00:02:00.581 --> 00:02:02.817
against vicious and
carnivorous Digimon.

00:02:05.586 --> 00:02:07.388
Fighting on the verge of death

00:02:07.422 --> 00:02:10.224
and surpassing their
previous limit,

00:02:10.258 --> 00:02:12.794
Tai and Agumon finally activated

00:02:12.827 --> 00:02:15.897
and awakened an
unknown digivolution.

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.666
(dramatic music)

00:02:27.508 --> 00:02:29.243
[Tai] WarGreymon.

00:02:29.277 --> 00:02:31.612
I feel overwhelming power.

00:02:33.614 --> 00:02:34.582
(footsteps pattering)

00:02:34.615 --> 00:02:35.917
Tai!

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.785
Oh, thank goodness you're okay.

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:39.654
What a digivolution!

00:02:39.687 --> 00:02:41.422
How did you two pull it off?

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:43.458
I don't know.

00:02:43.491 --> 00:02:46.094
I guess we didn't really
have much of a choice.

00:02:46.127 --> 00:02:47.295
[Woodmon 1] What is this?

00:02:47.328 --> 00:02:48.663
[Woodmon 2] I don't know.

00:02:48.696 --> 00:02:49.664
(Woodmon grumbling)

00:02:49.697 --> 00:02:51.432
(footsteps pattering)

00:02:51.466 --> 00:02:52.433
Is something wrong?

00:02:52.467 --> 00:02:55.369
Well, something strange, anyway.

00:02:57.305 --> 00:03:00.608
WarGreymon, thanks
to your return,

00:03:00.641 --> 00:03:02.510
I'm back with my memories.

00:03:02.543 --> 00:03:05.980
I can now remember the
ancient time spent with you.

00:03:07.014 --> 00:03:10.017
(beaming sound)

00:03:10.051 --> 00:03:13.387
(sound waves vibrating)

00:03:16.991 --> 00:03:19.560
(somber music)

00:03:23.731 --> 00:03:24.966
(metal clanging)

00:03:24.999 --> 00:03:26.000
Huh?

00:03:27.068 --> 00:03:28.469
Wait a second.

00:03:28.503 --> 00:03:29.470
Who are you?

00:03:29.504 --> 00:03:30.505
I'm Lopmon.

00:03:32.173 --> 00:03:34.408
That is my name in
this current life.

00:03:35.576 --> 00:03:38.146
I am but a remnant
of the Army of Light,

00:03:38.179 --> 00:03:41.415
who once fought valiantly
in the ancient war with you.

00:03:42.416 --> 00:03:43.384
(Tai gasping)

00:03:43.417 --> 00:03:45.186
Did you say ancient war?

00:03:47.688 --> 00:03:50.525
(Ghoulmons exploding)

00:03:50.558 --> 00:03:53.094
(somber music)

00:03:54.028 --> 00:03:55.329
[Lopmon] WarGreymon,

00:03:55.363 --> 00:03:58.833
along with the Digi-destined
child beside him.

00:03:58.866 --> 00:04:00.835
Your fearless courage to fight

00:04:00.868 --> 00:04:04.372
is what lit the path to
this new digivolution.

00:04:04.405 --> 00:04:06.574
Which means you
have successfully

00:04:06.607 --> 00:04:10.411
digivolved even further
into a Mega Digimon.

00:04:13.214 --> 00:04:14.182
(Agumon groaning)

00:04:14.215 --> 00:04:15.850
Agumon!

00:04:15.883 --> 00:04:16.884
Are you okay?

00:04:18.953 --> 00:04:21.189
Well, I could go for a bite.

00:04:21.222 --> 00:04:22.190
(all laughing)

00:04:22.223 --> 00:04:24.025
(footsteps thudding)

00:04:24.058 --> 00:04:25.026
No way!

00:04:25.059 --> 00:04:26.394
Thanks a million!

00:04:27.895 --> 00:04:31.933
Your digivolutions
are a miraculous skill

00:04:31.966 --> 00:04:36.437
only made possible by the
bond that you two share.

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:38.706
Because it is such
a great power,

00:04:38.739 --> 00:04:41.776
that form cannot be
sustained for long.

00:04:41.809 --> 00:04:42.810
Huh?

00:04:44.312 --> 00:04:46.547
(lightning cracking)

00:04:46.581 --> 00:04:48.449
That's black lightning.

00:04:48.482 --> 00:04:51.886
The telltale sign
of a new darkness.

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:53.254
A new darkness.

00:04:54.655 --> 00:04:56.123
We heard a mysterious voice

00:04:56.157 --> 00:04:58.759
at the temple on
the Cloud Continent

00:04:58.793 --> 00:05:02.096
and a Digimon with shining
wings told us this story.

00:05:04.131 --> 00:05:06.400
Said there was
once an ancient war

00:05:06.434 --> 00:05:08.903
that raged between
light and darkness,

00:05:08.936 --> 00:05:11.305
and both sides
perished in the battle,

00:05:11.339 --> 00:05:12.607
or so we thought.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.576
But now it sounds like a
new darkness is coming.

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.579
And so, the only ones
who can stop it are us,

00:05:18.613 --> 00:05:21.582
the Digi-destined and
our partner Digimon.

00:05:21.616 --> 00:05:24.986
I see you have already
received Valdurmon's guidance.

00:05:25.019 --> 00:05:27.922
Such a great Digimon
who fought in battle,

00:05:27.955 --> 00:05:30.825
and led the Army of
Light along with me.

00:05:30.858 --> 00:05:33.261
But there is something
you should know.

00:05:33.294 --> 00:05:35.296
One of the keystones
in the past war

00:05:35.329 --> 00:05:37.498
was WarGreymon's appearance

00:05:37.531 --> 00:05:41.168
and the awakening of my
ancient war memories.

00:05:41.202 --> 00:05:44.138
Darkness will not
overlook this matter.

00:05:44.171 --> 00:05:47.174
(suspenseful music)

00:05:49.543 --> 00:05:51.946
(lightning cracking)

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:54.649
(Bakemon growling)

00:05:54.682 --> 00:05:56.350
(Bakemon screaming)

00:05:56.384 --> 00:05:57.351
Huh?

00:05:57.385 --> 00:05:58.786
I knew it.

00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:01.722
We must evacuate this
location as soon as possible.

00:06:03.391 --> 00:06:06.193
(Lopmon yelling)

00:06:07.862 --> 00:06:10.531
(trees crunching)

00:06:10.564 --> 00:06:12.500
(suspenseful music)

00:06:12.533 --> 00:06:13.301
[Agumon] Wow!

00:06:16.671 --> 00:06:18.306
[Biyomon] How did you do that?

00:06:18.339 --> 00:06:20.975
(Tai gasping)

00:06:22.043 --> 00:06:24.545
[Tai] What are those things?

00:06:25.846 --> 00:06:27.848
They're trouble.

00:06:27.882 --> 00:06:30.017
[Biyomon] There's
so many of them.

00:06:30.051 --> 00:06:31.786
(Woodmon grunting)

00:06:31.819 --> 00:06:33.454
[Sora] Are those ghosts?

00:06:33.487 --> 00:06:34.655
Incorrect.

00:06:34.689 --> 00:06:36.357
Those are Bakemon.

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:38.159
(Bakemon screaming)

00:06:38.192 --> 00:06:39.293
Okay, I'm out.

00:06:39.327 --> 00:06:42.229
(Bakemon growling)

00:06:43.698 --> 00:06:47.702
(Sora and Biyomon panting)

00:06:47.735 --> 00:06:49.870
(Woodmon groaning)

00:06:49.904 --> 00:06:51.339
Be careful.

00:06:51.372 --> 00:06:54.508
They are the frontline
troops of the new darkness.

00:06:54.542 --> 00:06:56.811
Wait, oh, hold on, are
they targeting you?

00:06:56.844 --> 00:06:59.814
Of course, but the
same applies to you.

00:06:59.847 --> 00:07:00.815
(all gasping)

00:07:00.848 --> 00:07:02.383
(Bakemon screaming)

00:07:02.416 --> 00:07:04.985
(all gasping)

00:07:05.019 --> 00:07:08.489
(suspenseful music)

00:07:08.522 --> 00:07:09.523
Pepper Breath!

00:07:10.191 --> 00:07:11.592
Spiral Twister!

00:07:13.194 --> 00:07:14.195
Tiny Twister!

00:07:15.262 --> 00:07:18.065
(suspenseful music)

00:07:18.099 --> 00:07:20.067
We have to keep on moving.

00:07:20.101 --> 00:07:22.436
Just follow me and
don't look back.

00:07:23.904 --> 00:07:25.206
(all panting)

00:07:25.239 --> 00:07:26.874
What if he come after us?

00:07:28.609 --> 00:07:29.577
(Sora gasping)

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:32.546
(Lopmon screaming)

00:07:33.948 --> 00:07:37.251
(air whooshing)

00:07:37.284 --> 00:07:38.552
Wait, isn't this-

00:07:38.586 --> 00:07:40.855
What you are seeing
are my memories

00:07:40.888 --> 00:07:42.857
sent to your consciousness.

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:45.059
(all gasping)

00:07:45.092 --> 00:07:48.562
(exploding sounds)

00:07:48.596 --> 00:07:49.964
I remember this now.

00:07:51.132 --> 00:07:53.601
The war we saw back on
the Cloud Continent.

00:07:54.735 --> 00:07:55.903
[Lopmon] Yes.

00:07:55.936 --> 00:07:58.205
The previous battle
between us and darkness

00:07:58.239 --> 00:07:59.907
took place in the
skies and lands

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:01.976
of the entire Digital World.

00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:04.211
A digivolution!

00:08:04.245 --> 00:08:06.414
[Lopmon] I am one
of the Mega Digimon

00:08:06.447 --> 00:08:08.082
who led the Army of Light

00:08:09.316 --> 00:08:11.452
known as Cherubimon.

00:08:11.485 --> 00:08:15.055
(lightning cracking)

00:08:15.089 --> 00:08:17.625
(somber music)

00:08:21.929 --> 00:08:23.063
(all gasping)

00:08:23.097 --> 00:08:24.064
And that's-

00:08:24.098 --> 00:08:25.800
[Lopmon] The Digimon described

00:08:25.833 --> 00:08:28.803
as the ultimate
weapon of darkness.

00:08:28.836 --> 00:08:33.073
It's name is Millenniummon.

00:08:33.107 --> 00:08:34.141
(energy waves firing)

00:08:34.175 --> 00:08:36.143
(all groaning)

00:08:36.177 --> 00:08:37.812
(waves exploding)

00:08:37.845 --> 00:08:41.482
Millenniummon destroyed
everything in sight.

00:08:41.515 --> 00:08:45.319
With a power beyond the
army of darkness's control.

00:08:45.352 --> 00:08:47.354
And so we fought.

00:08:49.657 --> 00:08:51.325
(Tai gasping)

00:08:51.358 --> 00:08:52.827
[Tai] Angemon.

00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:54.028
But, who is...

00:08:55.296 --> 00:08:56.464
(Tai gasping)

00:08:56.497 --> 00:08:59.500
(melancholic music)

00:09:08.642 --> 00:09:09.810
They digivolved.

00:09:09.844 --> 00:09:12.880
(melancholic music)

00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:18.786
Only after sacrificing
everything,

00:09:18.819 --> 00:09:20.488
did we defeat Millenniummon.

00:09:21.689 --> 00:09:24.191
(all gasping)

00:09:25.826 --> 00:09:27.828
(shards raining)

00:09:27.862 --> 00:09:30.498
But complete elimination
wasn't possible,

00:09:30.531 --> 00:09:34.535
and remnant shards rained
down on the Cloud Continent,

00:09:34.568 --> 00:09:37.037
as well as here on
the Eternal Continent.

00:09:37.071 --> 00:09:39.974
(continent exploding)

00:09:40.007 --> 00:09:42.543
(Tai grunting)

00:09:42.576 --> 00:09:44.545
(Tai gasping)

00:09:44.578 --> 00:09:47.681
(footsteps thudding)

00:09:48.682 --> 00:09:49.650
(lightning cracking)

00:09:49.683 --> 00:09:51.218
(all crying)

00:09:51.252 --> 00:09:52.520
As for the black lightning

00:09:52.553 --> 00:09:55.656
that began to violently
strike this land,

00:09:55.689 --> 00:09:57.992
it is the energy
from the human world

00:09:58.025 --> 00:10:00.694
which the darkness so
desperately desires.

00:10:02.563 --> 00:10:05.666
The ominous dark glow
that spreads by the day

00:10:05.699 --> 00:10:08.202
becomes this Eternal
Continent's fuel.

00:10:09.403 --> 00:10:11.405
That fuel is stored up,

00:10:11.438 --> 00:10:14.308
and now, after
creating this energy,

00:10:14.341 --> 00:10:15.743
it is about to be used

00:10:15.776 --> 00:10:19.413
to power Millenniummon's dormant
shards throughout the land.

00:10:20.714 --> 00:10:23.584
So, does that mean
Millenniummon is coming back?

00:10:23.617 --> 00:10:25.085
I fear it's worse.

00:10:25.119 --> 00:10:27.755
I sense something
even stronger now.

00:10:27.788 --> 00:10:30.758
It will be the new darkness.

00:10:30.791 --> 00:10:33.594
I no longer hold the
power I did before,

00:10:33.627 --> 00:10:37.097
but I still have hope in
my heart because of you,

00:10:37.131 --> 00:10:38.532
the Digi-destined,

00:10:38.566 --> 00:10:41.035
who were able to awaken
a Mega Digivolution

00:10:41.068 --> 00:10:42.770
from your partner.

00:10:42.803 --> 00:10:45.372
When a Digimon's
life comes to an end,

00:10:45.406 --> 00:10:48.275
and they are reborn again
in a different place,

00:10:48.309 --> 00:10:50.578
their previous memories vanish

00:10:50.611 --> 00:10:53.747
into the depths of their
souls and are lost.

00:10:53.781 --> 00:10:56.717
The reawakening of all
my ancient memories,

00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:58.619
normally impossible,

00:10:58.652 --> 00:11:02.056
was made real by your
amazing digivolutions.

00:11:02.089 --> 00:11:04.458
I have faith that you
will be able to shine

00:11:04.491 --> 00:11:06.961
with the Celestial
Digimon's powers

00:11:06.994 --> 00:11:09.063
and do away with darkness.

00:11:09.096 --> 00:11:10.064
(Tai grunting)

00:11:10.097 --> 00:11:11.065
What's up?

00:11:11.098 --> 00:11:12.433
Something wrong, Tai?

00:11:15.102 --> 00:11:16.570
Hey, Lopmon.

00:11:16.604 --> 00:11:18.739
Do you think it's possible
the Celestial Digimon...

00:11:18.772 --> 00:11:22.076
(Tai gasping)

00:11:22.109 --> 00:11:24.645
(Bakemon growling)

00:11:24.678 --> 00:11:26.246
(Tai and Sora gasping)

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:28.415
[Biyomon] They're here!

00:11:28.449 --> 00:11:29.783
You know what to do!

00:11:29.817 --> 00:11:33.487
Agumon digivolve to

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:34.521
Greymon!

00:11:35.289 --> 00:11:36.290
Nova Blast!

00:11:38.292 --> 00:11:40.294
Okay, Biyomon, you ready?

00:11:40.327 --> 00:11:42.129
Biyomon digivolve to

00:11:43.631 --> 00:11:44.632
Birdramon!

00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:48.769
(Birdramon yelling)

00:11:48.802 --> 00:11:51.805
(suspenseful music)

00:11:54.341 --> 00:11:55.776
A new enemy comes.

00:11:55.809 --> 00:11:56.777
Let us hurry.

00:11:56.810 --> 00:11:59.813
(suspenseful music)

00:12:01.315 --> 00:12:02.449
(Tai gasping)

00:12:02.483 --> 00:12:05.486
(suspenseful music)

00:12:08.322 --> 00:12:10.357
(Lopmon gasping)

00:12:10.391 --> 00:12:11.625
Please give me a moment.

00:12:11.659 --> 00:12:14.161
I know of a way to save you.

00:12:15.162 --> 00:12:16.830
(Woodmon growling)

00:12:16.864 --> 00:12:19.867
(suspenseful music)

00:12:21.001 --> 00:12:23.170
(sickle clanging)

00:12:23.203 --> 00:12:26.206
(suspenseful music)

00:12:27.675 --> 00:12:28.876
No way!

00:12:28.909 --> 00:12:30.711
MetalPhantomon!

00:12:30.744 --> 00:12:33.981
The Ultimate Digimon that
digivolves from Bakemon!

00:12:34.014 --> 00:12:35.549
Greymon, are you ready?

00:12:35.582 --> 00:12:40.154
Always.

00:12:40.187 --> 00:12:43.223
(bright music)

00:12:43.257 --> 00:12:44.892
Nova Blast!

00:12:44.925 --> 00:12:47.861
(suspenseful music)

00:12:51.198 --> 00:12:54.168
(sickle clanging)

00:12:54.201 --> 00:12:57.004
(Greymon groaning)

00:12:57.037 --> 00:12:58.005
(Greymon grunting)

00:12:58.038 --> 00:12:59.840
You're fighting us, big guy!

00:12:59.873 --> 00:13:02.009
(MetalPhantomon groaning)

00:13:02.042 --> 00:13:04.178
(Greymon grunting)

00:13:04.211 --> 00:13:06.680
(Tai yelling)

00:13:06.714 --> 00:13:10.250
Greymon digivolve to

00:13:10.284 --> 00:13:11.385
MetalGreymon!

00:13:13.053 --> 00:13:15.856
(MetalGreymon screaming)

00:13:15.889 --> 00:13:18.892
(suspenseful music)

00:13:20.594 --> 00:13:22.429
All right, we're up!

00:13:22.463 --> 00:13:23.464
Okay!

00:13:24.965 --> 00:13:29.036
(electricity crackling)

00:13:29.069 --> 00:13:31.238
(Sora gasping)

00:13:31.271 --> 00:13:32.239
(sickle clanging)

00:13:32.272 --> 00:13:33.507
Hang on tight, Sora!

00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:35.409
[Sora] You don't have
to tell me twice!

00:13:35.442 --> 00:13:37.377
(suspenseful music)

00:13:37.411 --> 00:13:39.780
Please respond to my voice,

00:13:39.813 --> 00:13:42.549
and rise from your long slumber.

00:13:42.583 --> 00:13:45.586
(suspenseful music)

00:13:46.754 --> 00:13:48.964
(Lopmon grunting)

00:13:52.501 --> 00:13:53.602
(keyboard clacking)

00:13:53.635 --> 00:13:54.970
[Izzy] I see.

00:13:55.003 --> 00:13:57.573
The Digimon are what's
causing the satellite programs

00:13:57.606 --> 00:13:59.641
to slowly change
their positions.

00:13:59.675 --> 00:14:03.112
Ah, man, you've been mumbling
for a while up there.

00:14:03.145 --> 00:14:04.746
Is everything okay?

00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:05.881
Right now,

00:14:05.914 --> 00:14:08.817
I'm monitoring the International
Space Station's dilemma

00:14:08.851 --> 00:14:10.819
and hypothesizing the outcome.

00:14:10.853 --> 00:14:12.321
According to my data,

00:14:12.354 --> 00:14:14.456
there's trouble occurring
on all satellites in orbit.

00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:16.658
It hasn't made the
news yet, though.

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:20.429
So we're the only ones who know?

00:14:20.462 --> 00:14:21.797
[Izzy] That's right.

00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:24.333
All weather and communication
satellites worldwide

00:14:24.366 --> 00:14:25.767
are losing control,

00:14:25.801 --> 00:14:28.003
and they're starting to deviate
from their orbital paths.

00:14:28.036 --> 00:14:29.304
(machine beeping)

00:14:29.338 --> 00:14:31.006
[Male Astronaut] The
thruster's no good.

00:14:31.039 --> 00:14:32.307
We can't maneuver.

00:14:32.341 --> 00:14:33.976
[Female Astronaut] I'm getting
reports of space debris

00:14:34.009 --> 00:14:35.511
from the satellites as well.

00:14:37.179 --> 00:14:40.182
[Male Astronaut] Why did all
of this have to happen now?

00:14:40.215 --> 00:14:42.117
[Izzy] At the end
of all their paths

00:14:42.151 --> 00:14:44.786
is the International
Space Station.

00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:48.657
If they collide, they'll become
a large mass like a meteor!

00:14:49.825 --> 00:14:51.627
And what'll happen then?

00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:53.328
[Izzy] If my
estimate is correct,

00:14:53.362 --> 00:14:55.164
this mass will
fall toward Earth.

00:14:56.131 --> 00:14:57.799
There's no doubt
that parts of it

00:14:57.833 --> 00:14:59.535
will burn up in the atmosphere,

00:14:59.568 --> 00:15:02.671
but the bulk of it
will still make impact.

00:15:02.704 --> 00:15:04.540
And if that crashes into Earth,

00:15:04.573 --> 00:15:06.341
the effects would
be immeasurable!

00:15:08.076 --> 00:15:09.044
(Izzy gasping)

00:15:09.077 --> 00:15:10.512
[Kabuterimon] What's the matter?

00:15:10.546 --> 00:15:12.814
It says the crash point...

00:15:12.848 --> 00:15:14.816
It's Tokyo!

00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:17.519
The range of damage at
the time of crash would be

00:15:19.021 --> 00:15:20.389
catastrophic!

00:15:20.422 --> 00:15:23.425
(suspenseful music)

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:26.828
All right, let's
let him have it!

00:15:26.862 --> 00:15:28.830
[MetalGreymon] Giga Storm!

00:15:28.864 --> 00:15:30.832
(suspenseful music)

00:15:30.866 --> 00:15:32.534
(MetalPhantomon thudding)

00:15:32.568 --> 00:15:33.535
We're not done.

00:15:33.569 --> 00:15:35.170
[MetalGreymon] Oh, come on!

00:15:35.204 --> 00:15:38.207
(suspenseful music)

00:15:49.451 --> 00:15:51.253
He digivolved again?

00:15:52.788 --> 00:15:53.755
(chain clanging)

00:15:53.789 --> 00:15:55.190
(MetalGreymon groaning)

00:15:55.224 --> 00:15:56.925
(MetalGreymon grunting)

00:15:56.959 --> 00:15:58.360
(Digivice beeping)

00:15:58.393 --> 00:16:01.597
Reapermon, a Mega Digimon!

00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:03.699
(suspenseful music)

00:16:03.732 --> 00:16:04.700
Perfect.

00:16:04.733 --> 00:16:05.934
They're following us.

00:16:05.968 --> 00:16:08.403
(suspenseful music)

00:16:08.437 --> 00:16:10.772
Lure 'em in just a little more.

00:16:10.806 --> 00:16:11.773
Now!

00:16:11.807 --> 00:16:12.874
(Birdramon screaming)

00:16:12.908 --> 00:16:15.944
(suspenseful music)

00:16:15.978 --> 00:16:17.112
(Birdramon groaning)

00:16:17.145 --> 00:16:18.547
(Sora groaning)

00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:20.449
(suspenseful music)

00:16:20.482 --> 00:16:23.752
(Sora gasping)

00:16:23.785 --> 00:16:25.053
Birdramon!

00:16:25.087 --> 00:16:26.088
Save them!

00:16:27.089 --> 00:16:29.591
I'll do my best, Sora.

00:16:29.625 --> 00:16:31.460
Birdramon digivolve to

00:16:34.329 --> 00:16:35.330
Garudamon!

00:16:36.164 --> 00:16:39.167
(suspenseful music)

00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:42.271
Wing Blade!

00:16:44.473 --> 00:16:48.110
(MetalPhantomon exploding)

00:16:49.177 --> 00:16:52.114
(suspenseful music)

00:16:54.516 --> 00:16:57.286
(fire whooshing)

00:16:58.687 --> 00:17:00.122
(MetalGreymon grunting)

00:17:00.155 --> 00:17:02.157
(MetalGreymon screaming)

00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:04.426
(suspenseful music)

00:17:04.459 --> 00:17:05.460
Garudamon!

00:17:05.494 --> 00:17:06.461
On it!

00:17:06.495 --> 00:17:07.763
(Garudamon grunting)

00:17:07.796 --> 00:17:09.931
(suspenseful music)

00:17:09.965 --> 00:17:11.099
(Garudamon grunting)

00:17:11.133 --> 00:17:12.434
(Garudamon and Sora screaming)

00:17:12.467 --> 00:17:16.471
(MetalGreymon screaming)

00:17:16.505 --> 00:17:19.841
(MetalGreymon thudding)

00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:22.978
(MetalGreymon grunting)

00:17:23.011 --> 00:17:25.547
(Tai grunting)

00:17:26.648 --> 00:17:27.816
Okay, that hurt a little,

00:17:27.849 --> 00:17:29.351
but we can still fight.

00:17:29.384 --> 00:17:30.786
Right, bud?

00:17:30.819 --> 00:17:31.787
Yeah.

00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:33.989
(dramatic music)

00:17:34.022 --> 00:17:37.492
(Lopmon gasping)

00:17:37.526 --> 00:17:40.195
Giga Storm!

00:17:40.228 --> 00:17:42.798
(dramatic music)

00:17:42.831 --> 00:17:46.702
(MetalGreymon screaming)

00:17:46.735 --> 00:17:47.736
[Lopmon] It's working.

00:17:50.572 --> 00:17:52.708
This is as far as you go!

00:17:52.741 --> 00:17:54.476
End of the line!

00:17:54.509 --> 00:17:57.045
(Tai screaming)

00:17:57.079 --> 00:17:59.715
(upbeat music)

00:18:03.018 --> 00:18:05.754
MetalGreymon Mega
digivolve to...

00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:13.228
(singing in Japanese)

00:18:21.103 --> 00:18:22.104
WarGreymon!

00:18:25.607 --> 00:18:28.877
(WarGreymon screaming)

00:18:31.046 --> 00:18:32.581
(Lopmon gasping)

00:18:32.614 --> 00:18:37.452
(singing in Japanese)

00:18:40.789 --> 00:18:43.458
(air whooshing)

00:19:00.442 --> 00:19:02.878
Terra Force!

00:19:05.914 --> 00:19:08.216
(Reapermon exploding)

00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:13.088
("Break the Chain" by
Takayoshi Tanimoto)

00:19:15.824 --> 00:19:18.059
Oh, there you are!

00:19:18.093 --> 00:19:19.127
All right!

00:19:19.161 --> 00:19:20.729
We did it, Tai.

00:19:20.762 --> 00:19:22.731
Yeah. (gasping)

00:19:22.764 --> 00:19:25.500
(rumbling sound)

00:19:26.835 --> 00:19:29.471
(Komondomon barking)

00:19:29.504 --> 00:19:30.939
(Tai and Agumon gasping)

00:19:30.972 --> 00:19:34.676
So the way to save everyone
is with these Digimon?

00:19:36.678 --> 00:19:38.947
Long time no see, Komondomon.

00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:40.315
(Komondomon barking)

00:19:40.348 --> 00:19:42.150
In the days of the past war,

00:19:42.184 --> 00:19:46.087
the Komondomon were our friends
who dashed across the lands,

00:19:46.121 --> 00:19:48.123
saving the weak and helpless.

00:19:49.024 --> 00:19:50.091
Hi, Komondomon!

00:19:50.125 --> 00:19:51.326
Nice to meet you.

00:19:51.359 --> 00:19:52.928
(Komondomon barking)

00:19:52.961 --> 00:19:56.298
(somber music)

00:19:56.331 --> 00:19:59.501
I cannot leave the Woodmon
who've taken care of me.

00:19:59.534 --> 00:20:02.037
So I will stay here and
guide them to safety.

00:20:04.039 --> 00:20:05.340
-Hey, Lopmon.
-Huh?

00:20:05.373 --> 00:20:06.842
Answer me this.

00:20:06.875 --> 00:20:08.310
The Celestial Digimon,

00:20:08.977 --> 00:20:11.346
do you think there could
be another one out there?

00:20:11.379 --> 00:20:12.814
Indeed.

00:20:12.848 --> 00:20:16.284
The ones who became the key
to defeat Millenniummon.

00:20:16.318 --> 00:20:19.321
The Celestial Digimon
refers to the two souls

00:20:19.354 --> 00:20:20.956
who function as a pair.

00:20:20.989 --> 00:20:22.123
[Sora] Wait, what?

00:20:22.157 --> 00:20:24.359
[Agumon] I didn't know that.

00:20:24.392 --> 00:20:26.661
[Sora] Then that means
there's someone else like T.K.

00:20:26.695 --> 00:20:28.830
with the Celestial
Digimon partner?

00:20:30.031 --> 00:20:32.267
It's Kari, isn't it?

00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:33.268
(Lopmon grunting)

00:20:33.301 --> 00:20:34.269
(Sora and Biyomon gasping)

00:20:34.302 --> 00:20:35.971
[Lopmon] If that child
has been summoned

00:20:36.004 --> 00:20:37.205
to the Digital World,

00:20:38.206 --> 00:20:40.041
then what you say is true.

00:20:40.075 --> 00:20:42.677
(somber music)

00:20:44.079 --> 00:20:48.850
Komondomon, go rescue
Digimon who desire peace.

00:20:48.884 --> 00:20:49.885
Like the Woodmon.

00:20:49.918 --> 00:20:52.220
(Komondomon barking)

00:20:52.254 --> 00:20:55.357
(somber music)

00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:57.893
There are eight
Digi-destined children.

00:20:57.926 --> 00:21:00.695
Six warrior Digimon are
paired to the children

00:21:00.729 --> 00:21:02.831
and two Celestial Digimon.

00:21:02.864 --> 00:21:06.568
Find them all, including the
Celestial Digimon at once.

00:21:06.601 --> 00:21:08.904
(Sora and Biyomon chuckling)

00:21:08.937 --> 00:21:12.173
I'm not stopping till I
save Kari from AxeKnightmon,

00:21:12.207 --> 00:21:13.875
no matter what it takes.

00:21:13.909 --> 00:21:15.844
You with me, Agumon?

00:21:15.877 --> 00:21:17.012
(Agumon grunting)

00:21:17.045 --> 00:21:18.713
Took the words right
outta my mouth.

00:21:18.747 --> 00:21:20.882
If we can do that, it
might actually solve

00:21:20.916 --> 00:21:23.518
all of the problems
over in our world too.

00:21:23.552 --> 00:21:25.353
Then what are we waiting for?

00:21:25.387 --> 00:21:26.354
Let's go!

00:21:26.388 --> 00:21:29.524
[Agumon, Sora, And Tai] Yeah!

00:21:29.558 --> 00:21:30.525
(cape rustling)

00:21:30.559 --> 00:21:33.228
(Kari grunting)

00:21:35.964 --> 00:21:37.465
I sense someone.

[Agumon] I digivolved

and now I've got my
big boy pants on.
