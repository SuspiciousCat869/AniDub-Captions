[Narrator] This is
the mysterious world

00:01:42.743 --> 00:01:46.313
where Digimon live,
the Digital World.

00:01:46.346 --> 00:01:48.482
Tai Kamiya, the Digi-Destined,

00:01:48.515 --> 00:01:50.383
and their loyal Digimon partners

00:01:50.417 --> 00:01:54.154
all journey onward to a new
stage in their adventure.

00:01:54.187 --> 00:01:55.489
Their goal is to prevent

00:01:55.522 --> 00:01:58.558
Millenniumon's
impending resurrection.

00:01:58.592 --> 00:02:01.428
While Tai and his group
scout out the area.

00:02:03.263 --> 00:02:05.565
[Agumon] Come on, hurry, hurry!

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:07.334
[Tentomon] I don't
understand your excitement.

00:02:07.367 --> 00:02:08.435
[Agumon] Scouting, I'm scouting.

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:11.238
Scouting?

00:02:11.271 --> 00:02:13.573
[Man On Radio] Next up,
yesterday the cabinet

00:02:13.607 --> 00:02:15.575
during the press conference...

00:02:28.555 --> 00:02:32.058
In accordance with the
prime minister's statement-

00:02:32.893 --> 00:02:35.929
Come on, terrible reception.

00:02:35.962 --> 00:02:38.431
Chuumon, we ready to go?

00:02:38.465 --> 00:02:41.401
(Chuumon exclaims)

00:02:44.905 --> 00:02:47.240
Interesting, someone's
already here.

00:02:47.274 --> 00:02:48.742
Yeah.

00:02:48.775 --> 00:02:51.611
Garbagemon, an ultimate Digimon.

00:02:51.645 --> 00:02:55.115
And Chuumon, looks
like a rookie Digimon.

00:02:55.148 --> 00:02:58.451
That's right, but what are
they doing in this place?

00:02:58.485 --> 00:03:01.421
[Tentomon] Wonder what that
big clunky contraption does.

00:03:02.255 --> 00:03:03.623
(Izzy gasps)

00:03:03.657 --> 00:03:05.158
I think this one's it.

00:03:14.334 --> 00:03:16.169
Not another defective one!

00:03:17.637 --> 00:03:20.907
Don't get upset, you can always
learn from your mistakes,

00:03:20.941 --> 00:03:21.942
you know?

00:03:26.813 --> 00:03:28.181
Humans.

00:03:29.783 --> 00:03:32.485
Sorry, it's just
it's incredible,

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:35.255
what you've managed to do
with all of this garbage.

00:03:35.288 --> 00:03:36.923
[Garbagemon] You
watch your mouth, kid.

00:03:36.957 --> 00:03:38.425
This ain't garbage.

00:03:38.458 --> 00:03:40.794
This place is a
moment of treasure.

00:03:41.628 --> 00:03:43.663
Each of these objects
are pricesless artifacts

00:03:43.697 --> 00:03:45.832
that prove the existence
of another world.

00:03:45.866 --> 00:03:48.501
We're knee-deep in the
motherlode of knowledge.

00:03:48.535 --> 00:03:50.470
What a vivid description.

00:03:50.503 --> 00:03:53.340
They say one man's trash
is another man's cash,

00:03:53.373 --> 00:03:54.641
so don't judge.

00:03:54.674 --> 00:03:56.943
Assumptions are the
enemies of science.

00:03:56.977 --> 00:03:58.178
I'll remember that.

00:03:58.211 --> 00:04:00.347
So is this stuff also
part of your research?

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.515
Oh, that's just a pile of junk.

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:03.783
[Tentomon] But you just-

00:04:03.817 --> 00:04:08.021
A battery and a motor, a
desk lamp, a rice paddle

00:04:08.054 --> 00:04:09.522
sitting in a wash tub.

00:04:10.523 --> 00:04:13.126
Score, some cup noodles!

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:14.461
Can I eat them?

00:04:14.494 --> 00:04:15.962
(machine beeping)

00:04:15.996 --> 00:04:18.331
Unfortunately, it
appears they've expired.

00:04:18.365 --> 00:04:19.366
[Tai] Oh man.

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:20.834
I'm willing to risk it.

00:04:20.867 --> 00:04:22.035
[Izzy] There's a whole bunch

00:04:22.068 --> 00:04:23.570
of other household
goods as well.

00:04:24.671 --> 00:04:26.339
Katamete Poi Poi.

00:04:26.373 --> 00:04:28.375
[Tentomon] Oh cool, what is it?

00:04:28.408 --> 00:04:30.644
It turns frying oil
into a solid chunk

00:04:30.677 --> 00:04:32.479
for easy disposal.

00:04:32.512 --> 00:04:33.880
[Tentomon] Oh, science-y.

00:04:33.914 --> 00:04:35.482
What's that yellow thing?

00:04:35.515 --> 00:04:37.918
Oh, this is what
you call a tablet.

00:04:39.519 --> 00:04:40.987
Fascinating.

00:04:41.021 --> 00:04:43.690
An impressive piece
of technology.

00:04:43.723 --> 00:04:46.226
It's saved our bacon
quite a few times.

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:47.327
[Garbagemon] Say, Chuumon,

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.029
why don't we take
this thing apart?

00:04:49.062 --> 00:04:51.431
(Izzy gasps)

00:04:52.565 --> 00:04:53.833
How about not?

00:04:53.867 --> 00:04:56.836
Relax, kid, you'll get
it back when we're done.

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.839
I was wondering,
are you a scientist?

00:04:59.873 --> 00:05:01.574
You think like one.

00:05:01.608 --> 00:05:03.176
Guilty as charged.

00:05:03.209 --> 00:05:05.946
Right now I'm taking
a survey of this area.

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.083
I've noticed that a strange
black lightning storm

00:05:10.116 --> 00:05:11.351
has crackled through the sky

00:05:11.384 --> 00:05:13.753
over every part of
this eternal continent.

00:05:13.787 --> 00:05:17.190
But one day, it
suddenly disappeared.

00:05:17.223 --> 00:05:20.593
Immediately afterwards, all
kind of random bits and bobs

00:05:20.627 --> 00:05:22.929
started raining
down out of nowhere.

00:05:22.963 --> 00:05:24.597
Resulting in this
pile of rubbish,

00:05:24.631 --> 00:05:26.900
I mean, riches that you see now.

00:05:28.468 --> 00:05:31.905
Mm-hmm, that's why I've been
meticulously combing through it

00:05:31.938 --> 00:05:34.074
for answers ever
since that moment.

00:05:34.107 --> 00:05:36.576
What made that lightning
stop in the first place?

00:05:36.609 --> 00:05:38.278
Well, it stopped when Izzy and I

00:05:38.311 --> 00:05:40.714
took care of the
International Space Station.

00:05:40.747 --> 00:05:43.216
This reminds of the
refrigerator we found earlier.

00:05:43.249 --> 00:05:45.418
It's as if the data from
our world got scrambled in

00:05:45.452 --> 00:05:46.920
with the black lightning

00:05:46.953 --> 00:05:49.622
and caused all the items
to materialize everywhere.

00:05:49.656 --> 00:05:51.725
What's with the secrecy?

00:05:51.758 --> 00:05:53.159
What do you know?

00:05:54.594 --> 00:05:58.131
I'm gonna need you to
spill every little detail.

00:05:58.164 --> 00:06:00.467
Would you accompany
me to my laboratory?

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:01.501
What?

00:06:02.002 --> 00:06:03.837
Please, we'd love to.

00:06:08.675 --> 00:06:10.810
So heavy.

00:06:10.844 --> 00:06:13.246
So many remnants
from the lightning.

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:15.415
That's right, my
research tells me

00:06:15.448 --> 00:06:17.951
they've been mostly
accumulating in this area.

00:06:17.984 --> 00:06:19.786
[Tentomon] You think?

00:06:19.819 --> 00:06:21.821
What's this?

00:06:21.855 --> 00:06:23.656
A flash drive?

00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:27.127
That?

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:28.628
Never seen it in my life.

00:06:28.661 --> 00:06:31.765
Eh, you can have it,
knock yourself out.

00:06:31.798 --> 00:06:32.766
Yeah?

00:06:32.799 --> 00:06:33.800
Thank you.

00:06:37.637 --> 00:06:40.373
(dramatic music)

00:06:42.042 --> 00:06:43.376
Okay, who cut one?

00:06:44.811 --> 00:06:47.013
[Garbagemon] Oh no, not again.

00:06:48.381 --> 00:06:50.617
[Tentomon] Well,
that can't be good.

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:53.286
It's our friendly
old arch nemesis.

00:06:53.319 --> 00:06:54.554
Meet Raremon.

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:06.266
Is that Raremon's special move?

00:07:06.299 --> 00:07:08.168
Better keep a lid
on your trash cans.

00:07:08.201 --> 00:07:09.202
Watch out!

00:07:10.003 --> 00:07:12.505
(all gasping)

00:07:14.074 --> 00:07:15.041
Now, Tentomon!

00:07:15.075 --> 00:07:16.709
[Tentomon] Let's
take out the trash!

00:07:16.743 --> 00:07:17.844
Quick, Agumon.

00:07:17.877 --> 00:07:18.878
You got it.

00:07:19.846 --> 00:07:21.514
Agumon digivolve to-

00:07:22.849 --> 00:07:24.484
[Greymon] Greymon!

00:07:24.517 --> 00:07:27.053
[Tentomon] Tentomon
digivolve to-

00:07:27.087 --> 00:07:29.722
[Kabuterimon] Kabuterimon!

00:07:29.756 --> 00:07:31.825
What just happened?

00:07:31.858 --> 00:07:34.594
(dramatic music)

00:07:43.703 --> 00:07:45.171
Come on, buddy.

00:07:45.205 --> 00:07:47.173
That monster will
eat anything it sees.

00:07:47.207 --> 00:07:48.675
Kabuterimon!

00:07:48.708 --> 00:07:51.377
[Kabuterimon] Electro Shocker!

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:55.849
It's not working.

00:07:55.882 --> 00:07:56.950
Guess it's our turn.

00:07:58.218 --> 00:08:00.086
[Greymon] Nova Blast!

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:08.928
[Kabuterimon] It's way too hot!

00:08:08.962 --> 00:08:11.397
That's one spicy meatball.

00:08:12.532 --> 00:08:14.200
There aren't any
attacks that will work

00:08:14.234 --> 00:08:16.369
on that overgrown mudslide.

00:08:16.402 --> 00:08:18.271
And once he's hit,
things get ugly.

00:08:18.304 --> 00:08:19.806
[Tai And Izzy] What happens?

00:08:21.741 --> 00:08:25.086
[Garbagemon] He gets hungry.

00:08:30.775 --> 00:08:32.243
[Kabuterimon] Where you going?

00:08:32.277 --> 00:08:34.312
Was it something we said?

00:08:34.345 --> 00:08:35.914
[Greymon] Good riddance.

00:08:35.947 --> 00:08:37.649
Did he just leave?

00:08:37.682 --> 00:08:39.951
[Garbagemon] About those gizmos.

00:08:39.984 --> 00:08:40.985
Huh?

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:43.488
Can I see?

00:08:43.521 --> 00:08:44.689
I don't think so.

00:08:45.957 --> 00:08:47.826
[Garbagemon] How
very fascinating.

00:08:47.859 --> 00:08:49.928
So you're saying
this black lightning

00:08:49.961 --> 00:08:52.430
has something to do with
Millenniummon's resurrection?

00:08:52.463 --> 00:08:53.431
[Izzy] That's right.

00:08:53.464 --> 00:08:54.599
[Garbagemon] And these
kids are supposed to be

00:08:54.632 --> 00:08:56.501
the legendary Digi-Destined?

00:08:56.534 --> 00:08:57.702
[Tentomon] That's right.

00:08:57.735 --> 00:09:00.104
We were heading toward a place
called the Sealed Grounds,

00:09:00.138 --> 00:09:01.673
then we ran into you.

00:09:01.706 --> 00:09:05.043
Your story's scarier than a
cold mug of sewer slide tea.

00:09:07.345 --> 00:09:08.546
Good thing ours is hot.

00:09:10.014 --> 00:09:13.151
Seriously, because if any of
the residual black lightning

00:09:13.184 --> 00:09:17.121
that's accumulated here were
to affect Raremon somehow,

00:09:17.155 --> 00:09:20.291
one can only image the
mayhem it would cause.

00:09:20.325 --> 00:09:22.293
(all gasping)

00:09:22.327 --> 00:09:24.963
Hey, by the way, why do
you have so many mugs

00:09:24.996 --> 00:09:26.231
hanging around?

00:09:30.001 --> 00:09:31.469
Those old things?

00:09:31.502 --> 00:09:33.037
They belonged to
the many Chuumon

00:09:33.071 --> 00:09:35.006
who used to live
here and assist me.

00:09:37.175 --> 00:09:39.878
One by one, they got eaten

00:09:39.911 --> 00:09:41.913
while trying to fight
that hill of ooze.

00:09:43.882 --> 00:09:45.049
To tell you the truth,

00:09:45.083 --> 00:09:47.018
it gets me down
whenever I look at them.

00:09:47.051 --> 00:09:49.988
Each one's a reminder of
a friend I couldn't save.

00:09:50.021 --> 00:09:51.222
I won't give up though,

00:09:51.256 --> 00:09:53.825
even if I get gobbled up too.

00:09:53.858 --> 00:09:58.096
I have to do it for the
Chuumon to finish our research.

00:09:59.564 --> 00:10:03.368
And I'm going to remove that
rotten Raremon with this.

00:10:03.401 --> 00:10:05.403
(all gasping)

00:10:05.436 --> 00:10:07.405
Dude, is that a bazooka?

00:10:07.438 --> 00:10:09.207
Sure looks like it.

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:11.876
[Garbagemon] This is the
Absolute Zero Bazooka.

00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:13.578
With this, I can
freeze any opponent

00:10:13.611 --> 00:10:17.248
and pelt it with ice
bullets until it shatters.

00:10:17.282 --> 00:10:19.017
Amazing.

00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:20.852
You made that from scraps?

00:10:20.885 --> 00:10:24.088
Such craftsmanship goes
beyond simple resourcefulness.

00:10:24.122 --> 00:10:26.024
I'd say it's more akin
to pulling something

00:10:26.057 --> 00:10:27.191
out of thin air.

00:10:27.225 --> 00:10:28.526
I know, right?

00:10:28.559 --> 00:10:31.195
The product of a genius.

00:10:31.229 --> 00:10:33.932
(dramatic music)

00:10:45.276 --> 00:10:46.778
What's happening?

00:10:49.814 --> 00:10:52.417
It's more of that lightning.

00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:55.420
The buried remnants of it are
beginning to break through.

00:11:15.773 --> 00:11:18.810
I still don't understand
that crazy dude's plan.

00:11:18.843 --> 00:11:20.411
What's all this junk for?

00:11:20.445 --> 00:11:21.446
Seems so random.

00:11:23.982 --> 00:11:25.316
It's up ahead.

00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:27.251
Raremon's approaching the surge.

00:11:27.285 --> 00:11:28.486
Don't like that.

00:11:28.519 --> 00:11:31.022
Let's hurry, maximum
pressure, Chuumon.

00:11:36.127 --> 00:11:38.496
(horn blows)

00:11:42.867 --> 00:11:45.203
Such passion, wow.

00:11:46.471 --> 00:11:48.473
Revenge might not
be the best idea.

00:11:49.874 --> 00:11:53.444
But then again, only the
ones who were left behind

00:11:53.478 --> 00:11:55.947
understand that pain.

00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:58.683
The people and Digimon.

00:11:58.716 --> 00:12:00.318
[Kabuterimon]
Everything all right?

00:12:00.351 --> 00:12:01.319
Huh?

00:12:01.352 --> 00:12:02.820
I'm just strategizing.

00:12:02.854 --> 00:12:04.622
Hey, I was wondering,

00:12:04.655 --> 00:12:06.524
maybe we should wait
for Tai and Greymon

00:12:06.557 --> 00:12:07.825
to catch up first,

00:12:07.859 --> 00:12:09.527
since they might be
bringing over something

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:10.828
you'll need to use later.

00:12:10.862 --> 00:12:13.131
Everything on that
push cart is useless.

00:12:13.164 --> 00:12:15.700
What you might call
straight up garbage.

00:12:15.733 --> 00:12:17.335
Okay.

00:12:20.671 --> 00:12:23.174
Wait a minute, you
haven't even tested that.

00:12:25.243 --> 00:12:27.011
Don't worry, buttercup,

00:12:27.045 --> 00:12:30.014
from here on out, this is
my dispute to deal with.

00:12:31.082 --> 00:12:34.419
If I go down, take
care of Chuumon for me!

00:12:35.586 --> 00:12:36.621
Garbagemon!

00:12:36.654 --> 00:12:38.689
[Kabuterimon] No way,
don't tell me that maniac

00:12:38.723 --> 00:12:40.525
is trying to take
him down alone.

00:12:40.992 --> 00:12:43.027
This is for the Chuumon you ate.

00:12:46.531 --> 00:12:47.532
Say goodbye.

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:51.636
(upbeat music)

00:12:51.669 --> 00:12:53.037
He went for it.

00:13:02.246 --> 00:13:03.548
[Garbagemon] Did it work?

00:13:07.118 --> 00:13:08.086
Incredible.

00:13:08.119 --> 00:13:10.955
[Kabuterimon] Wow, he nailed it.

00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:16.727
Huh, the black lightning's
surging around the ice.

00:13:23.267 --> 00:13:24.802
My device failed.

00:13:26.104 --> 00:13:28.739
(somber music)

00:13:30.074 --> 00:13:31.142
Garbagemon.

00:13:33.144 --> 00:13:34.779
What's happening?

00:13:39.317 --> 00:13:42.587
(Rareraremon groaning)

00:13:43.454 --> 00:13:44.589
Rareraremon.

00:13:46.324 --> 00:13:48.259
This advanced form
is terrifying.

00:13:51.329 --> 00:13:52.730
Time to digivolve.

00:13:52.763 --> 00:13:55.299
[Kabuterimon] Don't
have to tell me twice.

00:13:55.333 --> 00:13:58.236
Kabuterimon digivolve to-

00:13:58.269 --> 00:14:00.805
[MegaKabuterimon]
MegaKabuterimon!

00:14:00.838 --> 00:14:02.006
Coming at you!

00:14:08.279 --> 00:14:09.847
Nothing, seriously?

00:14:11.182 --> 00:14:14.152
Okay then, how
about some of these.

00:14:16.988 --> 00:14:18.156
Okay, gross.

00:14:19.824 --> 00:14:20.958
What is this stuff?

00:14:20.992 --> 00:14:22.426
It smells like oil.

00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:23.561
Right, kiddo.

00:14:23.594 --> 00:14:25.997
Lately the only thing that
monster's been feasting on

00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:28.132
are fuel powered machines.

00:14:28.166 --> 00:14:30.835
We did see Raremon crunching
down on cars earlier.

00:14:30.868 --> 00:14:33.171
All that greasy stuff
can't be too healthy.

00:14:33.204 --> 00:14:35.973
He's basically a walking
tsunami of fuel and oil.

00:14:37.141 --> 00:14:39.177
Fuel and oil.

00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:43.781
So he's full of oil.

00:14:43.814 --> 00:14:44.849
Hold on a second.

00:14:47.151 --> 00:14:49.887
Ey?

00:14:56.627 --> 00:15:00.531
[MegaKabuterimon] Hey, what
do you think you're doing?

00:15:00.565 --> 00:15:01.566
Horn Buster!

00:15:04.735 --> 00:15:07.738
Whew, a little too
close for comfort.

00:15:11.909 --> 00:15:15.313
Really, are you that hungry?

00:15:17.982 --> 00:15:20.551
[Greymon] Greymon digivolve to-

00:15:20.585 --> 00:15:22.553
[MetalGreymon] MetalGreymon!

00:15:22.587 --> 00:15:23.554
Wowie!

00:15:23.588 --> 00:15:24.689
Perfect timing.

00:15:24.722 --> 00:15:26.390
Did you guys bring
that cart of...

00:15:26.424 --> 00:15:28.726
I mean, the materials?

00:15:28.759 --> 00:15:31.229
Yeah, why else would we be late?

00:15:31.262 --> 00:15:32.964
[MetalGreymon] What
do we do with it?

00:15:33.998 --> 00:15:37.768
Okay, listen up, you can
still make things right.

00:15:37.802 --> 00:15:40.905
You've got this, and I'm
gonna prove it to you, friend.

00:15:40.938 --> 00:15:43.307
[MegaKabuterimon] That's
right, it's garbage can,

00:15:43.341 --> 00:15:45.142
not garbage can't.

00:15:45.176 --> 00:15:47.845
Let's see, I think
it was in here.

00:15:48.679 --> 00:15:49.680
Yes!

00:15:50.348 --> 00:15:51.616
We're not done yet.

00:15:51.649 --> 00:15:52.817
Help me out, you two.

00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:54.285
I'm gonna need some extra hands.

00:15:54.318 --> 00:15:56.120
[Tai And MetalGreymon]
Sure thing.

00:15:58.189 --> 00:16:00.324
[MegaKabuterimon]
Izzy, what's the plan?

00:16:00.358 --> 00:16:01.792
What should we do?

00:16:01.826 --> 00:16:03.628
Step one is drawing
his attention.

00:16:03.661 --> 00:16:05.596
I need you guys to
attack from above.

00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:07.632
[MegaKabuterimon] Yes
sir, just leave it to us.

00:16:08.799 --> 00:16:11.369
(upbeat music)

00:16:20.678 --> 00:16:22.346
Forget about that bazooka.

00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:24.448
It's as useless as I am.

00:16:24.482 --> 00:16:27.318
No, it's not, and neither
are you, Garbagemon.

00:16:27.351 --> 00:16:29.120
You can learn from
your mistakes.

00:16:29.153 --> 00:16:30.688
Change your point of view,

00:16:30.721 --> 00:16:33.457
the same way we're going
to change how we fire this.

00:16:33.491 --> 00:16:35.493
One man's trash is
another's cash, right?

00:16:35.526 --> 00:16:36.694
I said that?

00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:41.632
Okay, this should work.

00:16:41.666 --> 00:16:43.668
This goes on the cooler.

00:16:45.069 --> 00:16:47.238
Oh, thanks a lot, Chuumon.

00:16:58.683 --> 00:16:59.850
Bon appetit.

00:17:02.687 --> 00:17:05.222
[Izzy] Tai, how's it
going on your end?

00:17:05.256 --> 00:17:08.059
Not bad, we're just doing
what you asked us to.

00:17:08.092 --> 00:17:09.493
I'm almost finished.

00:17:09.527 --> 00:17:11.395
By the way, Izzy,
what are you planning?

00:17:11.429 --> 00:17:13.698
You still haven't told
us at all what you...

00:17:14.732 --> 00:17:17.401
Thanks, and here's dessert.

00:17:23.541 --> 00:17:25.076
That ought to do it.

00:17:25.109 --> 00:17:28.679
On to phase two, take
Rareraremon for a spin.

00:17:28.713 --> 00:17:31.115
[MegaKabuterimon] Time
for the merry-go-round.

00:17:33.451 --> 00:17:37.054
Hey now, you'll get
your turn soon enough.

00:17:45.596 --> 00:17:47.598
It's beginning to blend.

00:17:47.631 --> 00:17:49.934
Earth to Izzy, what's up next?

00:17:49.967 --> 00:17:51.869
Now let's have MetalGreymon
bring up the heat

00:17:51.902 --> 00:17:53.404
with Giga Storm.

00:17:53.437 --> 00:17:55.940
[MetalGreymon] But that'll
burn MegaKabuterimon too.

00:17:55.973 --> 00:17:57.108
[MegaKabuterimon] I'll be fine,

00:17:57.141 --> 00:17:58.609
just give it your best shot,

00:17:58.642 --> 00:18:01.145
Izzy knows what he's doing,
so let's get cooking.

00:18:02.279 --> 00:18:04.448
Oh yeah, then fire
up the burner.

00:18:04.482 --> 00:18:06.617
[MetalGreymon] Let's
kick it up a notch.

00:18:07.752 --> 00:18:08.753
Giga Storm!

00:18:10.121 --> 00:18:11.789
(upbeat music)

00:18:11.822 --> 00:18:16.093
[MegaKabuterimon] Oh, hot,
hot, hot, ready to go!

00:18:17.495 --> 00:18:20.731
The heat's activating
the chemical in its body.

00:18:20.765 --> 00:18:22.400
(Chuumon exclaims)

00:18:22.433 --> 00:18:24.301
You want to get
in on the action?

00:18:24.335 --> 00:18:25.770
(Chuumon exclaims)

00:18:25.803 --> 00:18:27.104
(singing in Japanese)

00:18:27.138 --> 00:18:28.572
Almost there.

00:18:28.606 --> 00:18:30.574
You're something, kid.

00:18:30.608 --> 00:18:32.810
[MegaKabuterimon] Getting
a little warm over here,

00:18:32.843 --> 00:18:33.844
you guys!

00:18:37.681 --> 00:18:40.951
All right, MegaKabuterimon,
get out of there.

00:18:40.985 --> 00:18:44.188
[MegaKabuterimon]
Don't mind if I do.

00:18:45.289 --> 00:18:47.158
With MetalGreymon's attack,

00:18:47.191 --> 00:18:49.794
we'll be able to maximize the
cooler's power,

00:18:51.362 --> 00:18:52.363
hopefully.

00:18:54.799 --> 00:18:56.834
It's beautiful.

00:18:56.867 --> 00:18:59.937
It's now or never, so
give me all you got.

00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:02.373
Okay, you heard the boss man.

00:19:10.881 --> 00:19:14.385
Energy charged at
100%, firing now!

00:19:17.321 --> 00:19:18.456
Freezing him didn't work,

00:19:18.489 --> 00:19:20.191
so I thought we'd try this.

00:19:20.224 --> 00:19:23.461
Firming him up the same way
you'd solidify frying oil,

00:19:23.494 --> 00:19:25.362
by mixing in the
thickener, heating it up,

00:19:25.396 --> 00:19:26.864
and cooling it down.

00:19:26.897 --> 00:19:28.299
Giga Storm provides the heat,

00:19:28.332 --> 00:19:30.334
and MegaKabuterimon's
spinning attack

00:19:30.367 --> 00:19:31.836
mixes the thickener with the oil

00:19:31.869 --> 00:19:33.337
throughout Rareraremon's body.

00:19:33.370 --> 00:19:35.806
And if we cool that body
with the upgraded bazooka,

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:37.241
freezing him should work.

00:19:43.681 --> 00:19:46.016
Come on, just a little more.

00:19:51.889 --> 00:19:53.858
Come on, please work.

00:19:55.593 --> 00:19:57.094
So did we do it?

00:20:05.369 --> 00:20:08.205
[MegaKabuterimon] Yeah,
it totally worked.

00:20:08.239 --> 00:20:10.941
That bad boy's frozen solid.

00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:13.844
(Izzy gasps)

00:20:13.878 --> 00:20:15.346
Great strategizing, Izzy.

00:20:15.379 --> 00:20:16.914
Thanks.

00:20:16.947 --> 00:20:19.517
(Chuumon exclaims)

00:20:19.550 --> 00:20:22.686
You did it, you
scientific prodigy.

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:25.222
(Izzy laughs)

00:20:26.924 --> 00:20:28.859
[Tai] You've come up
with some crazy plans,

00:20:28.893 --> 00:20:30.427
but you've outdone
yourself this time.

00:20:30.461 --> 00:20:31.695
[Tentomon] I've
never seen someone

00:20:31.729 --> 00:20:33.030
get so fired up.

00:20:33.063 --> 00:20:34.899
[Agumon] My bad, I
got carried away.

00:20:34.932 --> 00:20:36.367
[Tentomon] I know
you got heated,

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:38.402
but I was actually
talking about Izzy.

00:20:38.435 --> 00:20:40.371
(all laughing)

00:20:40.404 --> 00:20:41.438
I'm impressed, kiddo.

00:20:41.472 --> 00:20:43.374
You've got a brain
built for science.

00:20:43.407 --> 00:20:45.876
I've never seen anyone
show so much determination.

00:20:45.910 --> 00:20:49.613
Oh please, your invention
made everything possible.

00:20:49.647 --> 00:20:52.783
If I was any help,
it's thanks to you.

00:20:52.816 --> 00:20:56.954
Anyway, from now on, I hope
you can stop doubting yourself

00:20:56.987 --> 00:20:59.256
and just focus on your research.

00:20:59.290 --> 00:21:02.326
You're too kind, Izzy,
thank you so much.

00:21:12.002 --> 00:21:14.338
Eureka, you just digivolved.

00:21:15.839 --> 00:21:17.474
Searchmon, eh?

00:21:17.508 --> 00:21:19.610
I guess Izzy was
so darn inspiring

00:21:19.643 --> 00:21:22.446
that you just couldn't
help yourself, I see now.

00:21:25.015 --> 00:21:27.618
(all laughing)

00:21:28.786 --> 00:21:31.121
Starting today, we'll
search through new land,

00:21:31.155 --> 00:21:34.525
we'll catch you all at
our next research site.

[Izzy] The Digimon Encyclopedia.

00:22:43.427 --> 00:22:47.531
Nanimon, an invader
Digimon known a Oyaji.

00:22:47.564 --> 00:22:49.900
Its special move is
called Power Punch.

00:22:49.933 --> 00:22:52.369
But it's actually made of poop?

00:22:52.403 --> 00:22:54.405
I definitely don't
wanna get hit.

00:22:54.438 --> 00:22:56.073
Anyway, now let's
check this out.

00:22:56.106 --> 00:22:58.542
With that steely gaze
and grizzled beard,

00:22:58.575 --> 00:23:00.844
Nanimon's the
manliest of them all.

00:23:00.878 --> 00:23:02.379
He's a true macho-mon.

00:23:02.413 --> 00:23:05.082
Okay, I think I just
told a dad joke.

00:23:07.384 --> 00:23:09.953
Which Digimon will
it be next time?

00:23:11.121 --> 00:23:14.391
[Narrator] Etemon faces

become the king of Digimon

[Tai] Next time, "Clash,
The King of Digimon."

00:23:21.799 --> 00:23:24.735
[Narrator] The adventure
continues in a new world.
