00:00:12.436 --> 00:00:14.838
[Narrator] In the year 2020 C.E.

00:00:16.006 --> 00:00:19.109
the human world is
connected by a network.

00:00:19.142 --> 00:00:23.780
That network is inhabited
by an unknown life form

00:00:23.814 --> 00:00:25.015
called Digimon.

00:00:26.516 --> 00:00:29.486

In order to save Tokyo
from its latest crisis,

00:02:13.882 --> 00:02:16.017
Tai and his friends
continue their journey

00:02:16.051 --> 00:02:17.853
through the Digital
World in their hunt

00:02:17.886 --> 00:02:19.588
for the Celestial Digimon.

00:02:19.621 --> 00:02:22.357
As the Digidestined head
for the Cloud Continent,

00:02:22.391 --> 00:02:25.260
they reach the sea, and they
also meet two new friends,

00:02:25.293 --> 00:02:26.395
Joe Kido and Gomamon.

00:02:27.796 --> 00:02:30.699
Overwhelmed by the need to
study for his school exams,

00:02:30.732 --> 00:02:33.435
Joe barely shows any interest
at all in the mission

00:02:33.468 --> 00:02:35.370
that the Digidestined
are pursuing.

00:02:35.404 --> 00:02:38.206
Tai and his friends are
baffled by his attitude

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.941
but despite Joe's reluctance,

00:02:39.975 --> 00:02:42.043
Gomamon diligently supports him

00:02:42.077 --> 00:02:44.112
and continues to believe in him.

00:02:44.146 --> 00:02:46.615
Touched by Gomamon's
selfless actions,

00:02:46.648 --> 00:02:49.618
Joe finds new resolve
and decides to become

00:02:49.651 --> 00:02:51.753
a true partner to Gomamon.

00:02:51.787 --> 00:02:55.457
And at that very moment
Joe's Digivice lights up,

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.927
and Gomamon is able to
digivolve into Ikkakumon.

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:19.147
[Agumon] I see it! I see it!

00:03:19.181 --> 00:03:21.983
[Tai] That giant bright
light? Yeah, can't miss it!

00:03:22.017 --> 00:03:23.485
And somewhere on that continent

00:03:23.518 --> 00:03:25.620
we're gonna find the
Celestial Digimon!

00:03:28.957 --> 00:03:30.992
Hey, Joe, they said
we're almost there.

00:03:33.462 --> 00:03:36.698
This is perfect! That light
is guiding us straight there!

00:03:38.633 --> 00:03:41.436
Is that a light house?

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.472
Out here in the
middle of nowhere?

00:03:43.638 --> 00:03:45.841
(digivise rings)

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:51.313
Hey guys, I wanted to report
the situation in Tokyo.

00:03:55.817 --> 00:03:58.487
(weary music)

00:04:13.835 --> 00:04:16.338
Because of the power
outage, the supermarkets and

00:04:16.371 --> 00:04:19.541
convenience stores in the
city barely have anything on

00:04:19.574 --> 00:04:21.009
their shelves anymore

00:04:21.042 --> 00:04:24.179
Am I wrong, or in our
world only one day has past

00:04:24.212 --> 00:04:25.881
so far hasn't it?

00:04:25.914 --> 00:04:27.849
And its already that bad?

00:04:27.883 --> 00:04:30.986
Everyone's on edge since
that last cyber attack

00:04:31.019 --> 00:04:33.154
I think people feel
like its just disaster

00:04:33.188 --> 00:04:34.556
after disaster lately.

00:04:34.589 --> 00:04:36.658
Izzy, you're how old now?

00:04:36.691 --> 00:04:38.026
You're pretty smart

00:04:38.059 --> 00:04:40.195
I mean, you know smart
for someone your age.

00:04:40.228 --> 00:04:42.097
Hm? Oh, not really

00:04:43.932 --> 00:04:45.200
As the oldest one here,

00:04:45.233 --> 00:04:47.402
I should really be the
leader of this group.

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.839
Anyway, we'll hurry and
get over there just as soon

00:04:50.872 --> 00:04:51.873
as we can.

00:04:52.774 --> 00:04:55.043
You guys we really
gotta focus on finding

00:04:55.076 --> 00:04:57.279
the celestial digimon
right now okay?

00:05:00.615 --> 00:05:01.850
Huh?

00:05:01.883 --> 00:05:03.218
Hey Izzy!

00:05:08.223 --> 00:05:09.758
Ah! Hey look you guys!

00:05:11.893 --> 00:05:15.230
(Dramatic violin music)

00:05:24.072 --> 00:05:25.206
What is that place?

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.975
It looks like a
military instillation!

00:05:33.081 --> 00:05:34.215
Watch out!

00:05:34.249 --> 00:05:36.418
(screams)

00:05:52.834 --> 00:05:53.835
Grab on!

00:05:55.437 --> 00:05:58.640
If I show my face again
we will be fired on.

00:05:58.673 --> 00:05:59.841
Where is everyone else?

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:03.511
Hey are you okay?

00:06:04.179 --> 00:06:05.180
[Palmon] Somehow!

00:06:11.786 --> 00:06:12.787
Ugh, Mimi!

00:06:17.192 --> 00:06:19.361
( shriek)

00:06:21.363 --> 00:06:22.364
Yeah!

00:06:22.764 --> 00:06:24.099
We're saved!

00:06:24.866 --> 00:06:27.135
Thank you for the
lift Birdramon!

00:06:35.377 --> 00:06:38.046
We made it this far and
were not giving up now.

00:06:47.155 --> 00:06:48.156
Get back!

00:06:50.492 --> 00:06:51.493
Look out!

00:06:58.566 --> 00:06:59.801
Here it comes!

00:07:01.903 --> 00:07:03.238
Meteor wing!

00:07:07.842 --> 00:07:08.843
Birdramon!

00:07:11.079 --> 00:07:12.747
Talk about a welcoming committee

00:07:23.391 --> 00:07:24.392
Tai

00:07:26.928 --> 00:07:27.929
Blue blaster!

00:07:38.073 --> 00:07:39.074
This way!

00:07:58.460 --> 00:07:59.928
What was that all about?

00:08:02.931 --> 00:08:05.400
Thanks for that, you
totally saved our bacon.

00:08:09.471 --> 00:08:10.572
Matt!

00:08:10.605 --> 00:08:13.408
You know I had a feeling
you were gonna show up here.

00:08:13.441 --> 00:08:14.409
You know him?

00:08:14.442 --> 00:08:15.410
Yeah!

00:08:15.443 --> 00:08:16.644
He's a friend of mine!

00:08:18.813 --> 00:08:21.082
wait, that means you're
the one from before.

00:08:25.487 --> 00:08:27.956
Yeah I'm Gabumon.

00:08:27.989 --> 00:08:30.125
Hey Gabumon, how you doing?

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:35.897
Tai, do you know what the
situation in Tokyo is right now?

00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:40.401
Yeah, izzy told us all
about it. Ill tell you after

00:08:40.435 --> 00:08:43.104
you tell us, what
is going on here?

00:08:44.839 --> 00:08:45.840
Hmm

00:08:55.183 --> 00:08:59.988
that guy is Gorillamon, he
uses Solarmons's light to keep

00:09:00.021 --> 00:09:01.422
an eye on the area.

00:09:01.456 --> 00:09:03.958
And when he spots an
intruder he fire on them.

00:09:03.992 --> 00:09:06.928
And like we just saw, they're
also protecting the fortress

00:09:06.961 --> 00:09:09.931
with those Tankmon
down on the shore.

00:09:09.964 --> 00:09:11.966
We've been thinking of
sneaking into that fortress

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.434
to get around all that.

00:09:13.468 --> 00:09:14.435
What?!

00:09:14.469 --> 00:09:16.337
There are a whole lot
of really dangerous

00:09:16.371 --> 00:09:18.640
enemies out there, and for
some reason they've been

00:09:18.673 --> 00:09:20.775
targeting all of
us. You guys know

00:09:20.809 --> 00:09:22.010
what I'm talking about.

00:09:24.012 --> 00:09:26.347
But what we don't know
is there identity.

00:09:26.381 --> 00:09:28.783
Who are they? And are they
connected somehow to the

00:09:28.817 --> 00:09:30.885
disasters that have
been occurring in Tokyo?

00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:34.355
If we can get inside
of that fortress

00:09:34.389 --> 00:09:36.791
we should be able to find
some information about them.

00:09:36.825 --> 00:09:39.160
No way! We're just
a bunch of kids!

00:09:39.194 --> 00:09:40.161
Let's do it!

00:09:40.195 --> 00:09:41.596
We really don't have any choice.

00:09:41.629 --> 00:09:44.032
We can't go any further if
we don't get past this place!

00:09:44.065 --> 00:09:45.166
-Uh huh!
-Hold on.

00:09:45.633 --> 00:09:47.302
If we go in a big group,

00:09:47.335 --> 00:09:49.404
that's only gonna make
us an easier target.

00:09:52.006 --> 00:09:54.209
I don't need anyone
holding me back.

00:09:54.242 --> 00:09:56.978
Tai, you keep an
eye on these guys.

00:09:57.011 --> 00:09:58.179
Hey Matt, wait!

00:10:04.018 --> 00:10:05.753
That was really
nice of you Matt.

00:10:07.188 --> 00:10:09.891
I guess that you just want
everybody to stay safe huh?

00:10:11.759 --> 00:10:12.760
Lets go

00:10:14.229 --> 00:10:15.230
Okay!

00:10:41.623 --> 00:10:43.558
Gabumon digivolve to..

00:10:57.438 --> 00:10:59.999
Garurumon!

00:11:16.507 --> 00:11:18.509
Tai! Hey, you guys!

00:11:21.446 --> 00:11:24.716
It's no use. Something is
jamming our communication.

00:11:24.749 --> 00:11:26.417
I wonder if this means
something's happened

00:11:26.451 --> 00:11:28.486
on Tai's side of things?

00:11:28.519 --> 00:11:31.489
Unfortunately, that's something
we can't help or control.

00:11:31.522 --> 00:11:33.258
All we can do is believe in them

00:11:33.291 --> 00:11:36.294
and get there as fast as we can!

00:11:36.327 --> 00:11:37.862
So I'm speeding up!

00:12:00.218 --> 00:12:01.853
No... no, it's too..

00:12:01.886 --> 00:12:03.454
Huh?

00:12:03.488 --> 00:12:04.822
It's too reckless!

00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:07.525
Mimi, I'm borrowing this!

00:12:07.558 --> 00:12:08.993
What?!

00:12:09.027 --> 00:12:11.329
Hey! That's my best towel!

00:12:11.362 --> 00:12:12.363
Wait! Joe!

00:12:17.702 --> 00:12:19.370
Hey! We surrender!

00:12:20.838 --> 00:12:24.208
We don't want to fight!
We're just passing through!

00:12:24.242 --> 00:12:26.544
We have absolutely
no desire to fight!

00:12:26.577 --> 00:12:28.313
-No will at all!
-Wait a minute!

00:12:28.346 --> 00:12:30.348
-We're not from here!
-What does he think he's doing?

00:12:30.381 --> 00:12:32.717
Don't use my towel
as a white flag!

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:34.218
Give that back right now!

00:12:34.252 --> 00:12:36.354
-Do you hear me?
-Joe come back!

00:12:36.387 --> 00:12:38.189
Don't worry! If we just explain,

00:12:38.222 --> 00:12:39.691
I'm sure it'll be all right!

00:12:41.893 --> 00:12:42.894
Look out!

00:13:00.712 --> 00:13:01.746
Nice one, Palmon!

00:13:01.779 --> 00:13:03.114
Oh, my precious towel!

00:13:04.215 --> 00:13:05.717
It was Sora's, anyway

00:13:09.387 --> 00:13:10.388
Thanks, Joe.

00:13:11.622 --> 00:13:13.391
Cause of you, I have a plan.

00:13:13.424 --> 00:13:15.026
Huh?!

00:13:15.059 --> 00:13:16.594
If they want a target,

00:13:16.627 --> 00:13:18.563
then we'll just have
to give 'em one!

00:13:18.596 --> 00:13:21.232
Agumon, were gonna act as decoys

00:13:21.265 --> 00:13:23.034
to help out Matt and Garurumon!

00:13:23.067 --> 00:13:24.268
Gotcha!

00:13:24.302 --> 00:13:25.770
In that case count us in!

00:13:25.803 --> 00:13:27.038

00:13:28.072 --> 00:13:29.440
Wha-?!

00:13:29.474 --> 00:13:32.143
Hey! What are the rest
of us supposed to do now?

00:13:34.078 --> 00:13:35.246
Wait a second.

00:13:37.448 --> 00:13:39.450
(screams)

00:13:44.088 --> 00:13:46.758
No way! Do we have
to fight too?!

00:13:55.433 --> 00:13:57.602
It's pretty quiet over here.

00:13:59.937 --> 00:14:01.639
No! Stop! Go away!

00:14:13.951 --> 00:14:16.788
Oh man, super fast! As usual.

00:14:17.622 --> 00:14:19.123
Those guys're impressive.

00:14:21.025 --> 00:14:22.026
Yeah!

00:14:47.051 --> 00:14:48.319
A gatekeeper!

00:15:00.998 --> 00:15:03.734
He's strong. The odds are
against us in this fight.

00:15:10.007 --> 00:15:11.809
Pepper Breath!

00:15:11.843 --> 00:15:13.244
Spiral Twister!

00:15:15.746 --> 00:15:16.747
Go, Matt!

00:15:17.849 --> 00:15:20.151
We'll stay here and
hold this guy off!

00:15:20.184 --> 00:15:22.220

We're going, too!

00:16:01.459 --> 00:16:02.527

00:16:05.296 --> 00:16:06.297

You got this! Jump!

00:16:54.437 --> 00:16:59.442
(soft dramatic music)

00:17:57.366 --> 00:18:02.371
(rock music)

00:18:03.406 --> 00:18:04.407
Garurumon!

Harpoon Torpedo!

Meteor Wing!

00:19:36.465 --> 00:19:38.000
Now's our chance!

00:19:40.102 --> 00:19:42.471
Nova Blast!

00:20:17.706 --> 00:20:20.709
Doesnt look like there's no
one left inside of this place.

00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:24.480
Oh! You have a
little smudge there

00:20:27.049 --> 00:20:29.552
We owe you a big thanks
for saving us earlier!

00:20:30.519 --> 00:20:31.520
No...

00:20:35.324 --> 00:20:37.993
No, we were the
ones who were saved.

00:20:39.562 --> 00:20:41.997
I treated you guys like
you'd be dead weight.

00:20:42.031 --> 00:20:43.032
Sorry bout that.

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:45.668
Look, at this point

00:20:45.701 --> 00:20:48.103
I'm just glad that all
of us are still alive!

00:20:48.137 --> 00:20:49.672
Although to tell the truth,

00:20:49.705 --> 00:20:51.373
the only reason
you're alive right now

00:20:51.407 --> 00:20:53.642
is because of Palmon, Joe.

00:20:53.676 --> 00:20:54.710
How embarrassing.

00:20:54.743 --> 00:20:58.848
(everyone laughing)

00:20:58.881 --> 00:21:00.916

00:21:11.427 --> 00:21:12.528
What is this place?

00:21:16.932 --> 00:21:19.568
I wonder if there might be
a record of their activity

00:21:19.602 --> 00:21:21.770
or communication
that was left behind?

00:21:32.715 --> 00:21:35.050
wait, isn't this?

00:21:35.551 --> 00:21:40.556
(peaceful music)

00:22:01.577 --> 00:22:02.545

00:22:02.578 --> 00:22:03.579
