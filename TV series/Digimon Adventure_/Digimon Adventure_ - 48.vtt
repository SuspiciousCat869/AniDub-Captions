[Narrator] This is
the mysterious world

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:45.187
where Digimon live...
the Digital World.

00:01:47.156 --> 00:01:49.959
Tai, Kari, and the other
Digi-destined children

00:01:49.992 --> 00:01:52.094
mysteriously found
themselves here

00:01:52.128 --> 00:01:53.596
from the human world.

00:01:53.629 --> 00:01:56.999
Upon arrival, they met the
Digimon that would soon become

00:01:57.033 --> 00:01:59.935
their dependable
Digimon partners.

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.305
Working together, they are
now on a life changing journey

00:02:03.339 --> 00:02:05.808
to save The Digital
World and their own.

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:10.446
Along the way to find
the Celestial Digimon,

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.481
the key to saving the world,

00:02:12.515 --> 00:02:16.952
the ancient Digimon history
gradually becomes clear.

00:02:16.986 --> 00:02:19.121
The bringer of
destruction and darkness

00:02:19.155 --> 00:02:21.891
known as Milleniummon
plots his return.

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:26.362
This remaining evil
soul of his lingers on

00:02:26.395 --> 00:02:28.631
and stimulates violent Digimon

00:02:28.664 --> 00:02:31.434
in order to make them digivolve.

00:02:31.467 --> 00:02:34.303
In hopes of using them in
order to create a new body

00:02:34.336 --> 00:02:36.338
in which he can be reborn again.

00:02:37.673 --> 00:02:42.678
-(dramatic music)
-(characters burbling)

00:02:45.181 --> 00:02:47.983
To prevent Milleniummon's
resurrection,

00:02:48.017 --> 00:02:51.587
the Digi-destined headed
toward the Sealed Grounds.

00:02:52.688 --> 00:02:55.157
Just when their journey
was about to end,

00:02:55.191 --> 00:02:59.161
a terrible situation began
to unfold before them.

00:02:59.195 --> 00:03:00.429
-(notification chimes)
-[Izzy] Huh?

00:03:01.564 --> 00:03:02.731
Come here, you guys.

00:03:02.765 --> 00:03:03.966
(Tai and Matt gasping)

00:03:03.999 --> 00:03:04.967
(group chuckling)

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.902
[Leomon] Long time
no see, children.

00:03:08.938 --> 00:03:10.239
[Tai] (chuckles) Leomon!

00:03:10.272 --> 00:03:11.907
[Matt] You're alive.

00:03:11.941 --> 00:03:15.244
Yes, and my comrades
are as well.

00:03:15.277 --> 00:03:16.712
We're all fine.

00:03:16.745 --> 00:03:19.515
(group sighs and giggles)

00:03:19.548 --> 00:03:21.183
Eldoradimon is safe too.

00:03:21.217 --> 00:03:24.253
[Mimi] Oh, I'm so
glad to hear that.

00:03:24.286 --> 00:03:26.055
[Leomon] Somehow or another,

00:03:26.088 --> 00:03:28.257
we were able to make
it through that storm.

00:03:29.225 --> 00:03:32.361
Soon after, this castle emerged.

00:03:32.394 --> 00:03:34.530
[Mimi] A castle?

00:03:34.563 --> 00:03:36.232
[Leomon] We're using
the system inside

00:03:36.265 --> 00:03:37.566
to communicate right now.

00:03:38.734 --> 00:03:41.270
[Joe] What do you
mean a castle emerged?

00:03:41.303 --> 00:03:45.274
This castle must also be a
part of Eldoradimon's body.

00:03:45.307 --> 00:03:48.110
So as his wounds heal, the
body will slowly return

00:03:48.144 --> 00:03:49.578
to its normal state.

00:03:50.613 --> 00:03:52.081
Lopmon's there too!

00:03:52.114 --> 00:03:54.917
[Leomon] Yes, we came across
Lopmon during our journey,

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:56.952
and he told us many stories.

00:03:56.986 --> 00:03:58.921
What about all the Woodmon?

00:03:58.954 --> 00:04:01.624
Everyone is being
well cared for here.

00:04:01.657 --> 00:04:05.761
More importantly, you all
must be getting close.

00:04:05.794 --> 00:04:07.296
(Tai grunts affirmatively)

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:10.900
(mysterious music)

00:04:10.933 --> 00:04:12.234
Heads up, guys.

00:04:12.268 --> 00:04:14.136
Yeah. I sense it.

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.072
[Tentomon] He sure is
intense. (chuckles nervously)

00:04:17.106 --> 00:04:18.908
[Biyomon] It's not
a very good feeling.

00:04:18.941 --> 00:04:21.610
[Gatomon] Oh man.
You're not kidding.

00:04:21.644 --> 00:04:23.579
I'm getting the chills all over.

00:04:23.612 --> 00:04:25.481
[Patamon] Gatomon.

00:04:25.514 --> 00:04:28.617
[Gatomon] It looks different,
but there's no question.

00:04:28.651 --> 00:04:30.452
This is it. We made it.

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:32.821
The sealed grounds.

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:36.458
It must be hidden
somewhere nearby.

00:04:36.492 --> 00:04:40.596
The shard that will be the
key to Milleniummon's revival.

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:43.465
(mysterious music)

00:04:45.034 --> 00:04:47.703

(Komondomon whimpering)

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:03.452
You have to hurry.

00:05:03.485 --> 00:05:04.853
If you cannot stop it

00:05:04.887 --> 00:05:07.856
then Milleniummon's
resurrection will-

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:10.459

[TK] Guys, look.

00:05:13.062 --> 00:05:14.363
[Matt] You're joking.

00:05:15.564 --> 00:05:17.733
[Tai] (gasps) The
Cloud Continent.

00:05:20.002 --> 00:05:23.405

00:05:25.174 --> 00:05:27.309
(electronic chittering)

00:05:27.343 --> 00:05:31.814
Heed my words! All is under
the will of Milleniummon.

00:05:31.847 --> 00:05:33.482
That's Vademon!

00:05:33.515 --> 00:05:35.718
The ones who are trying
to bring Milleniummon

00:05:35.751 --> 00:05:37.186
back into this world!

00:05:38.687 --> 00:05:41.724
They're also responsible
for... (grunts)

00:05:41.757 --> 00:05:42.725

-(eerie music)
-(Kari gasps)

00:05:44.927 --> 00:05:47.563
[Vademon] At last, it
seems we've reached

00:05:47.596 --> 00:05:50.666
the final stage of our plan.

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:53.335
Hurry, Komondomon,
you have to stop!

00:05:53.369 --> 00:05:56.572

Ready, Tai?

00:06:37.079 --> 00:06:39.715

Is that a Digimon?

00:07:05.107 --> 00:07:06.308
What's going on?

00:07:06.342 --> 00:07:08.744
What you are seeing is the
result of the accumulation

00:07:08.777 --> 00:07:11.413
of countless Digimon data.

00:07:11.447 --> 00:07:13.816
Who is the strongest
Digimon you ask?

Look no further.

[Vademon] Of all the
countless data accumulated

00:09:02.891 --> 00:09:06.228
within Sakkakumon, what
Milleniummon showed

00:09:06.261 --> 00:09:11.266
the most interest in by far
was none other than the power

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:16.205
of those who destroyed the
Milleniummon of the past.

00:09:16.238 --> 00:09:20.375
Machinedramon was constructed
from start to finish

with that data as
his core foundation.

00:09:23.745 --> 00:09:26.915
Milleniummon wants
nothing more than for you

00:09:52.074 --> 00:09:55.944
(group crying and groaning)

00:09:55.978 --> 00:09:58.947
[Lopmon] What's going on
with the Cloud Continent?

00:09:58.981 --> 00:10:00.616
Could it be?

00:10:00.649 --> 00:10:03.118
(dramatic music)

00:10:03.151 --> 00:10:05.621

00:10:05.654 --> 00:10:08.757
(suspenseful music)

00:10:11.159 --> 00:10:14.062
He shot at the Cloud
Continent earlier too.

00:10:14.096 --> 00:10:15.464
What are they planning here?

00:10:15.497 --> 00:10:16.932
It's just a theory,

00:10:16.965 --> 00:10:19.968
but it may be tied to
Milleniummon's resurrection.

00:10:20.002 --> 00:10:21.470
Well, resurrection or not,

00:10:21.503 --> 00:10:24.239
there are still a ton of
Digimon in danger up there.

00:10:24.273 --> 00:10:26.775
Then let's destroy
those cannons first.

00:10:26.808 --> 00:10:28.310
[Weregarurumon] Gladly.

00:10:28.343 --> 00:10:31.179
(lights charging)

00:10:32.281 --> 00:10:34.483

(sword smashes)

00:10:58.840 --> 00:10:59.841
Woo-hoo!

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:07.849
(grunts) thanks,
Komondomon. Nice save.

00:11:07.883 --> 00:11:09.451
Hang in there, Tentomon.

00:11:09.484 --> 00:11:10.452
(Tentomon groaning)

00:11:10.485 --> 00:11:12.187
Hang in there.

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:13.956
[Joe] Gomamon.

00:11:13.989 --> 00:11:18.994
-(suspenseful music)
-(Kari gasping)

00:11:19.828 --> 00:11:21.830
Heaven's Charm!

(light tinkling)

00:11:24.566 --> 00:11:26.034

(blasters charging)

00:11:41.083 --> 00:11:43.986
Again! Let's go, MetalGreymon!

00:11:44.019 --> 00:11:45.988
Now Weregarurumon!

00:11:46.021 --> 00:11:51.026
-(suspenseful music)
-(lights charging)

-(suspenseful music)

00:12:13.615 --> 00:12:16.952

-(suspenseful music)

(blades clashing)

00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:50.919

(Komondomon whimpering)

00:13:47.676 --> 00:13:49.811
[Sora] Tai, WarGreymon.

00:13:51.713 --> 00:13:54.549
(blaster zapping)

00:13:59.321 --> 00:14:01.189

(mystical music)

00:14:24.579 --> 00:14:27.382
(chargers pulsing)

00:14:27.415 --> 00:14:29.584
[WarGreymon] This power,

00:14:30.752 --> 00:14:31.853
what is this?

00:14:33.355 --> 00:14:36.091
(blaster firing)

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:41.363
(Kari gasping)

00:14:42.931 --> 00:14:44.533
[Angewomon] Kari.

00:14:46.268 --> 00:14:49.037
(blaster firing)

00:14:52.073 --> 00:14:54.910
(blast exploding)

00:14:58.113 --> 00:15:01.116
This feeling, it's
the same as before.

00:15:02.584 --> 00:15:05.220
The power of the
Celestial Digimon...

00:15:08.723 --> 00:15:11.359
(mystical whooshing)

00:15:11.393 --> 00:15:14.062
(Tai grunts)

00:15:14.095 --> 00:15:16.798
(dramatic music)

00:15:22.571 --> 00:15:23.572
Everyone...

00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:27.442
Big brother.

00:15:27.475 --> 00:15:31.379
[Tai] Our goal remains the
same, to find Milleniummon

00:15:31.413 --> 00:15:35.116
and prevent his
resurrection at all costs.

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:37.719
Honestly, I don't
know what might happen

00:15:37.752 --> 00:15:41.289
if we lose to Machinedramon,
which is exactly why

00:15:41.323 --> 00:15:43.792
we can't afford to wait
around and find out.

00:15:45.126 --> 00:15:46.595
The time when we'll really need

00:15:46.628 --> 00:15:49.831
the Celestial Digimon's powers
must still be in the future.

00:15:51.266 --> 00:15:57.147
So that's why WarGreymon and
I will put an end to this!

00:16:03.028 --> 00:16:04.095
Yeah, right.

00:16:04.129 --> 00:16:06.431
Do you really expect us
to just leave you behind?

00:16:06.464 --> 00:16:07.465
Matt...

00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:14.439
I leave the rest to you.

00:16:14.472 --> 00:16:17.209
(dramatic music)

00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:20.178
[Matt] Come back safe.

00:16:20.212 --> 00:16:23.648
But if you don't,
you have my word.

00:16:25.517 --> 00:16:28.853
[Tai] Glad to hear it,
and you have my word

00:16:28.887 --> 00:16:31.323
that I'll come back victorious.

00:16:31.356 --> 00:16:32.857

00:17:00.518 --> 00:17:02.220
No backing down!

-(upbeat music)
-(singing in Japanese)

00:17:09.594 --> 00:17:12.564
I swear we'll win,
no matter what!

00:17:12.597 --> 00:17:17.168
[WarGreymon] Yeah, and
we'll stay true to our word.

00:17:17.202 --> 00:17:22.207

WarGreymon!

00:18:09.154 --> 00:18:11.623
[WarGreymon] This is nothing.

[Izzy] Next up on the Digimon
Encyclopedia is Petaldramon.

00:22:45.096 --> 00:22:49.000
Petaldramon is a super enormous
Digimon covered in plants.

00:22:49.033 --> 00:22:50.602
Almost like a walking forest!

00:22:51.436 --> 00:22:52.537
(electronics pulsing)

00:22:52.570 --> 00:22:54.672
Now check out this fun fact!

00:22:54.706 --> 00:22:56.574
This Digimon
resembles the axolotl

00:22:56.608 --> 00:22:59.077
which was an animal
popular in the 1980s.

00:22:59.110 --> 00:23:00.912
I wonder if all the
plants would be crushed

00:23:00.945 --> 00:23:02.914
if Petaldramon rolled over.

00:23:02.947 --> 00:23:04.415
Wait, now I'm worried!

it be next time?

[Narrator] The time draws near.

00:23:13.391 --> 00:23:15.727
Can the children
overcome their sorrow

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:18.096
and prevent Milleniummon's
resurrection?

00:23:18.129 --> 00:23:21.432
Next time: The God of Evil
Descends, Milleniummon.

00:23:21.466 --> 00:23:24.068
[Narrator] The adventure
continues in a new world.
