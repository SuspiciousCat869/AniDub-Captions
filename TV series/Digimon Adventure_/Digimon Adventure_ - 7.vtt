[Narrator] In the
year 2020 C.E.,

00:00:15.675 --> 00:00:19.079
the human world is
connected by a network.

00:00:19.112 --> 00:00:23.750
That network is inhabited
by an unknown life form

00:00:23.783 --> 00:00:24.951
called Digimon.

00:00:26.286 --> 00:00:28.822

Tai and his friends
have now discovered

00:02:11.766 --> 00:02:16.271
that the key to saving Tokyo
is the Celestial Digimon.

00:02:17.472 --> 00:02:19.641
As the group made their
way through the forest,

00:02:19.674 --> 00:02:23.144
they encountered a human
girl named Mimi Tachikawa.

00:02:23.177 --> 00:02:25.580
They learned that she
ruled over a small kingdom

00:02:25.613 --> 00:02:28.483
with Tanemon and
her friend Palmon.

00:02:28.516 --> 00:02:31.486
Tuskmon ransacked the
orchard Mimi protected,

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:33.454
and in the aftermath
of that battle,

00:02:33.488 --> 00:02:36.524
Mimi was attacked
by a cunning enemy.

00:02:37.692 --> 00:02:39.994
That was when Mimi's
Digivice lit up,

00:02:40.028 --> 00:02:43.131
and Palmon digivolved
into Togemon.

00:02:43.164 --> 00:02:46.768
(emotional music)

00:02:46.801 --> 00:02:49.103
With Mimi now
joining their party,

00:02:49.137 --> 00:02:51.940
Tai and his friends
decide to head for the sea

00:02:51.973 --> 00:02:54.542
to cross over to the continent.

00:02:58.146 --> 00:03:00.715
(gentle music)

00:03:03.318 --> 00:03:05.620
Your skills have really
improved, Palmon.

00:03:05.653 --> 00:03:07.855
What you brewed up
here is as tasty as

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:09.457
the actual Golden Tippy!

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:11.359
(Palmon sighing happily)

00:03:11.392 --> 00:03:14.495
(sighs) I agree,
Palmon, it's terrific!

00:03:14.529 --> 00:03:15.964
The snacks are yummy, too!

00:03:15.997 --> 00:03:18.700
(Biyomon and Agumon
munching loudly)

00:03:18.733 --> 00:03:21.469
It's so nice, I could
stay here forever.

00:03:21.502 --> 00:03:23.972
Wait, we should probably get
moving pretty soon, though,

00:03:24.005 --> 00:03:24.973
shouldn't we?

00:03:25.006 --> 00:03:26.474
My grandpa is very wise,

00:03:26.507 --> 00:03:28.876
and he once told me that
traders who rush things

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.178
make less money.

00:03:30.211 --> 00:03:31.879
-Uh...
-Huh?

00:03:31.913 --> 00:03:35.717
Palmon, how much further
is the sea from here?

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.552
It's right behind you.

00:03:37.585 --> 00:03:38.586
What?

00:03:39.253 --> 00:03:40.888
(both gasping)

00:03:40.922 --> 00:03:44.192
(leaves rustling)

00:03:44.225 --> 00:03:46.894
-(waves splashing)
-(seagulls chirping)

00:03:46.928 --> 00:03:50.064
(both laughing)

00:03:50.098 --> 00:03:52.233
Hey, look, there it is!

00:03:52.266 --> 00:03:54.402
(Mimi giggling)

00:03:54.435 --> 00:03:59.440
-(waves splashing)
-(seagulls chirping)

00:04:04.445 --> 00:04:07.081
Do you see the continent yet?

00:04:07.115 --> 00:04:08.249
[Tai] 'Fraid not.

00:04:08.282 --> 00:04:10.618
Nothing's showing up so far.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.521
Hey, Birdramon!

00:04:13.554 --> 00:04:15.023
How are you holding up?

00:04:15.056 --> 00:04:16.057
I'm fine!

00:04:17.425 --> 00:04:21.262
I just hope the distance isn't
too far for me to fly across.

00:04:21.295 --> 00:04:23.798
(tense music)

00:04:24.966 --> 00:04:27.802
(waves splashing)

00:04:30.138 --> 00:04:32.440
(Mimi yawning)

00:04:32.473 --> 00:04:33.441
Wait a minute.

00:04:33.474 --> 00:04:34.776
What's that?

00:04:34.809 --> 00:04:36.110
What are you seeing?

00:04:36.144 --> 00:04:38.246
-Check it out!
-(Agumon and Sora humming)

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:41.449
(whirlpool splashing)

00:04:43.317 --> 00:04:44.285
(Sora gasping)

00:04:44.318 --> 00:04:47.555

00:04:47.588 --> 00:04:48.556
(Tai yelping)

00:04:48.589 --> 00:04:49.757
Birdramon, look out!

00:04:49.791 --> 00:04:52.794
(Birdramon gasping)

00:04:53.995 --> 00:04:55.763
(Sora screaming)

00:04:55.797 --> 00:04:57.131
-(Birdramon gasping)
-Sora!

00:04:57.165 --> 00:04:58.566
(projectiles firing)

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:00.068
(Birdramon grunting)

00:05:00.101 --> 00:05:03.971
-(Birdramon screaming)
-(water splashing)

00:05:04.005 --> 00:05:05.440

Sora!

00:05:06.474 --> 00:05:07.475

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:11.446
Over here, Tai!

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:12.780
Are you two all right?

00:05:12.814 --> 00:05:13.781
We're fine.

00:05:13.815 --> 00:05:15.583
Is everybody else safe?

00:05:15.616 --> 00:05:16.818
Birdramon!

00:05:16.851 --> 00:05:18.419
-(water splashing)
-(Sora gasping)

00:05:18.453 --> 00:05:19.420
Biyomon...

00:05:19.454 --> 00:05:20.988
(water splashing)

00:05:21.022 --> 00:05:22.490
Everybody swim!

-(all panting)
-(water splashing)

00:05:27.195 --> 00:05:29.530
[Gomamon] Marching Fishes!

(water splashing)

00:05:32.166 --> 00:05:33.668
I'm sorry, what now?

00:05:33.701 --> 00:05:34.836
(Gomamon gasping)

00:05:34.869 --> 00:05:36.504
Follow me, you guys!

00:05:36.537 --> 00:05:39.373
(water splashing)

00:05:42.477 --> 00:05:43.678
(Tai sighing)

00:05:43.711 --> 00:05:45.613
Rescued just in time!

00:05:45.646 --> 00:05:48.483
(Sora breathing shakily)

00:05:48.516 --> 00:05:49.484
(Sora gasping)

00:05:49.517 --> 00:05:51.285
Biyomon, are you alright?

00:05:51.319 --> 00:05:52.286
Yeah.

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.789
I'm just glad you're okay, Sora.

00:05:54.822 --> 00:05:56.691
What happened, you guys?

00:05:56.724 --> 00:05:58.292
We don't really know.

00:05:58.326 --> 00:06:00.194
Something squiggly
came out of a whirlpool

00:06:00.228 --> 00:06:01.796
in the middle of the water.

00:06:01.829 --> 00:06:04.365
[Gomamon] That
creature was Gesomon.

00:06:04.398 --> 00:06:05.967
Gesomon?

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.368
It's a vicious Digimon

00:06:07.401 --> 00:06:09.303
that lives at the
bottom of the sea.

00:06:09.337 --> 00:06:11.205
When anybody tries
to cross the strait,

00:06:11.239 --> 00:06:14.175
it jumps up and attacks
'em without warning!

00:06:14.208 --> 00:06:15.710
And who are you?

00:06:15.743 --> 00:06:17.812
My name is Gomamon.

00:06:17.845 --> 00:06:19.981
So you're the one
who came to save us!

00:06:20.014 --> 00:06:21.215
Thanks so much.

00:06:21.249 --> 00:06:23.384
You really have
some amazing powers!

00:06:23.417 --> 00:06:25.052
Marching Fishes, right?

00:06:25.086 --> 00:06:27.188
Yeah, it's my special technique!

00:06:27.221 --> 00:06:30.391
I'm glad you're here, you
must be the Digi-destined.

00:06:30.424 --> 00:06:33.027
Hold on, Gomamon,
you know about us?

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:34.028
Yeah!

00:06:34.061 --> 00:06:36.230
In fact, I actually
have a partner, too!

00:06:36.264 --> 00:06:37.698
What kind of partner?

00:06:37.732 --> 00:06:38.900
You mean a human?

00:06:38.933 --> 00:06:40.401
Then there will be another kid

00:06:40.434 --> 00:06:42.703
searching for the
Celestial Digimon with us.

00:06:42.737 --> 00:06:43.704
Maybe.

00:06:43.738 --> 00:06:45.373
I mean, if he's interested.

00:06:45.406 --> 00:06:49.010
(all humming questioningly)

00:06:49.043 --> 00:06:51.612
(wind howling)

00:06:54.215 --> 00:06:57.185
(TV playing jingle)

00:06:57.218 --> 00:06:58.853
[News Host] The power
outage within the city

00:06:58.886 --> 00:07:01.389
has become more widespread.

00:07:01.422 --> 00:07:03.724
These districts
are now affected.

00:07:03.758 --> 00:07:07.695
Saitama and large sections
of Chiba and Kanagawa.

00:07:07.728 --> 00:07:09.430
As we reported in the last hour,

00:07:09.463 --> 00:07:11.899
Kawaguchi and Urayasu
have been without power

00:07:11.933 --> 00:07:13.968
since early this morning.

00:07:14.969 --> 00:07:16.871
-(power humming)
-Huh?

00:07:16.904 --> 00:07:17.939
Oh!

00:07:17.972 --> 00:07:19.574
The microwave just turned off.

00:07:19.607 --> 00:07:23.110
If it doesn't come back on
soon, dinner's going to be late.

00:07:24.812 --> 00:07:26.514
[News Host] Officials have
been unwilling to announce

00:07:26.547 --> 00:07:28.850
a predicted recovery
time for this disruption,

00:07:28.883 --> 00:07:30.551
and without a secure
source of power,

00:07:30.585 --> 00:07:33.221
the city could cease to
operate in a few days.

00:07:33.254 --> 00:07:34.455
This is terrible.

00:07:34.488 --> 00:07:36.891
The situation is getting
worse every moment!

00:07:36.924 --> 00:07:38.726
(Izzy sighing)

00:07:38.759 --> 00:07:41.479
We have to join Tai's
group as fast as we can!

00:07:44.849 --> 00:07:48.352
-(waves splashing)
-(seagulls chirping)

00:07:48.386 --> 00:07:50.187
[All] Uh...

00:07:50.221 --> 00:07:52.890
(comical music)

00:08:00.064 --> 00:08:01.465
This is new to me.

00:08:01.499 --> 00:08:03.301
What's this guy doing?

00:08:03.334 --> 00:08:06.337
-He's studying.
-In this place?

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:07.338
Hey, Joe!

00:08:07.371 --> 00:08:08.439
I know you're busy,

00:08:08.472 --> 00:08:11.042
but I brought the other
Digi-destined to meet you.

00:08:13.077 --> 00:08:14.378
Huh?

(Joe gasping)

00:08:16.914 --> 00:08:18.649
Are you humans?

00:08:18.683 --> 00:08:19.650
Nailed it!

00:08:19.684 --> 00:08:21.152
I'm Tai Kamiya.

00:08:21.185 --> 00:08:23.054
My name is Sora Takenouchi.

00:08:23.087 --> 00:08:24.388
Mimi Tachikawa.

00:08:24.422 --> 00:08:26.223
Pleasure to meet you!

00:08:26.257 --> 00:08:27.558
My name's Agumon!

00:08:27.592 --> 00:08:28.693
Biyomon!

00:08:28.726 --> 00:08:30.194
I'm Palmon!

00:08:30.227 --> 00:08:31.662
(Joe sighing sadly)

00:08:31.696 --> 00:08:32.830
[All] Huh?

00:08:32.863 --> 00:08:35.499
So there are no
grown-ups with you?

00:08:35.533 --> 00:08:36.500
Huh?

00:08:36.534 --> 00:08:37.702
This is really important!

00:08:37.735 --> 00:08:41.005
Do any of you know how I can
get back to the other world?

00:08:41.038 --> 00:08:43.407
I don't have any idea
how you could do that.

00:08:43.441 --> 00:08:45.176
(Joe sighing sadly)

00:08:45.209 --> 00:08:46.510
Nevermind that.

00:08:46.544 --> 00:08:48.512
We really need your help.

00:08:48.546 --> 00:08:49.547
Huh?

00:08:51.048 --> 00:08:52.416
[Sora] So that's the story.

00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:55.252
Tokyo is in big trouble and
it's about to get worse.

00:08:55.286 --> 00:08:57.088
We've traced the problem
to elements located

00:08:57.121 --> 00:08:58.823
right here in the Digital World.

00:08:58.856 --> 00:09:00.524
[Mimi] The only
hope the city has

00:09:00.558 --> 00:09:03.260
is for us to try and
stop the cyber-attack.

00:09:03.294 --> 00:09:04.729
What do you mean by "us?"

00:09:04.762 --> 00:09:07.365
To do it, we have to find
the Celestial Digimon!

00:09:07.398 --> 00:09:10.701
And for that, we need both
you and Gomamon to help us!

00:09:10.735 --> 00:09:13.871
(Joe humming thoughtfully)

00:09:13.904 --> 00:09:15.940
All I wanna do is
get outta here.

00:09:15.973 --> 00:09:19.110
Oh, by the way, my
name is Joe Kido.

00:09:19.143 --> 00:09:20.111
Hey, Sora.

00:09:20.144 --> 00:09:21.846
Doesn't this guy look
kind of familiar?

00:09:21.879 --> 00:09:24.281
Oh! Come to think of it,
he might have been one of

00:09:24.315 --> 00:09:27.051
the counselors on our
camping trip recently.

00:09:27.084 --> 00:09:29.120
Even if your story
were to be true,

00:09:29.153 --> 00:09:31.055
and I'm not saying it is,

00:09:31.088 --> 00:09:33.224
why come to me to
help get through this?

00:09:33.257 --> 00:09:34.892
I'm not anyone special!

00:09:34.925 --> 00:09:36.794
I have no time for
nonsense like this!

00:09:36.827 --> 00:09:39.130
I have important
entrance exams coming up!

00:09:39.163 --> 00:09:40.297
(hand slamming)

00:09:40.331 --> 00:09:41.932
(all gasping)

00:09:41.966 --> 00:09:43.901
Fact is, whoever
studies all summer

00:09:43.934 --> 00:09:46.237
-will do better at the exams!
-(hands slamming)

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:47.238
It's not fair!

00:09:47.271 --> 00:09:48.739
Why's it have to be me

00:09:48.773 --> 00:09:50.608
who's trapped in this place?

00:09:50.641 --> 00:09:51.976
While I'm stuck here,

00:09:52.009 --> 00:09:53.644
my rivals are all getting ahead!

00:09:53.678 --> 00:09:54.979
-(house creaking)
-(all gasping)

00:09:55.012 --> 00:09:56.647
-Why doesn't anyone understand?
-(head slamming)

00:09:56.681 --> 00:09:58.582
I come from a long
line of doctors!

00:09:58.616 --> 00:10:00.284
Everyone in my
family is a doctor

00:10:00.317 --> 00:10:01.986
and I have become one, too!

00:10:02.019 --> 00:10:03.821
I can't juggle
everything at once!

00:10:03.854 --> 00:10:05.756
If you're so insistent
that I contribute something

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:08.826
to society, I'll do it after
I graduate and get my license,

00:10:08.859 --> 00:10:10.928
but right now I have to study!

00:10:10.961 --> 00:10:13.130
-(house creaking)
-(Joe whimpering)

00:10:13.164 --> 00:10:16.167
-(house crashing)
-(all screaming)

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:19.437
(Joe whimpering)

00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:21.605
You sure you wanna
take this guy with us?

00:10:21.639 --> 00:10:23.340
(Tai chuckling nervously)

00:10:23.374 --> 00:10:26.510
(waves splashing)

00:10:26.544 --> 00:10:27.511
We need to go!

00:10:27.545 --> 00:10:29.447
-Joe, you came to this world
-(Joe grunting)

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:31.482
because you have an
important role to play.

00:10:31.515 --> 00:10:34.185
Now's your chance to step up!

00:10:34.218 --> 00:10:35.519
We're partners,
we'll work together!

00:10:35.553 --> 00:10:36.754
[Joe] Listen, Gomamon.

00:10:36.787 --> 00:10:39.523
You've been a great help, and
I honestly do appreciate it.

00:10:39.557 --> 00:10:41.525
But to tell you the truth,

00:10:41.559 --> 00:10:45.496
I really don't ever remember
us becoming partners.

00:10:45.529 --> 00:10:47.031
(Gomamon gasping)

00:10:47.064 --> 00:10:48.499
(Gomamon sighing sadly)

00:10:48.532 --> 00:10:50.968
(all sighing sadly)

00:10:51.001 --> 00:10:52.203
Joe, right?

00:10:52.236 --> 00:10:54.004
Look, I know this
job is dangerous

00:10:54.038 --> 00:10:56.540
and we can't force
you to come along,

00:10:56.574 --> 00:10:59.543
but we're the only ones
who can stop this attack.

00:10:59.577 --> 00:11:01.545
Hypothetically, let's
say that the four of us

00:11:01.579 --> 00:11:04.215
travel around this bizarre
and dangerous world,

00:11:04.248 --> 00:11:06.684
and we're successful in
mounting this defense

00:11:06.717 --> 00:11:08.819
you're so committed
to achieving.

00:11:08.853 --> 00:11:10.554
At that point, is
there any guarantee

00:11:10.588 --> 00:11:13.357
that we're able to
return to our world?

00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:15.226
Listen, Joe...

00:11:15.259 --> 00:11:18.362
Gomamon, you can go with
them and fight their fight.

00:11:18.395 --> 00:11:20.564
I plan to stay here and study.

00:11:20.598 --> 00:11:25.603
-(Gomamon stammering)
-(Tai sighing)

00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:31.408
As long as Gesomon's
lurking out there,

00:11:31.442 --> 00:11:33.244
we can't cross this strait.

00:11:33.277 --> 00:11:36.013
We have to find a way to
chase that creature off.

00:11:36.046 --> 00:11:38.048
I understand, but how?

00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:40.851
(Tai sighing)

00:11:40.885 --> 00:11:43.621
(waves splashing)

00:11:45.956 --> 00:11:48.626
(water bubbling)

00:11:52.263 --> 00:11:54.765
-(whooshing)
-(logo twinkling)

00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:57.701
Come on, Joe!

00:11:57.735 --> 00:12:00.271
Are you really not gonna
go with the others?

00:12:00.304 --> 00:12:03.374
Even if I did, there'd be
nothing I could do to help.

00:12:05.042 --> 00:12:06.443
It's better if I stay here

00:12:06.477 --> 00:12:09.580
and concentrate on
what I need to do.

00:12:12.416 --> 00:12:15.252
(waves splashing)

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:24.461
[Tai] Biyomon, you
should stay behind

00:12:24.495 --> 00:12:26.564
and rest until
you feel stronger.

00:12:26.597 --> 00:12:29.233
We should be okay with
just Agumon and Palmon.

00:12:29.266 --> 00:12:31.635
We have no chance against
Gesomon in the water,

00:12:31.669 --> 00:12:33.604
but if we can get him on land,

00:12:33.637 --> 00:12:36.073
then the advantage
will be on our side.

00:12:36.106 --> 00:12:37.107
(Agumon humming affirmatively)

00:12:37.141 --> 00:12:38.108
We can do it!

00:12:38.142 --> 00:12:39.743
We can take that slug down!

00:12:39.777 --> 00:12:42.079
We'll do it for us,
and Biyomon as well!

00:12:42.112 --> 00:12:43.080
That's right!

00:12:43.113 --> 00:12:44.582
We'll show him who's boss!

00:12:44.615 --> 00:12:46.750
Agumon, Palmon...

00:12:46.784 --> 00:12:49.787
Well, if that's the plan,
you can count me in!

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:52.590
I'll be the bait to
draw Gesomon over here.

00:12:52.623 --> 00:12:53.657
Gomamon?

00:12:53.691 --> 00:12:54.825
It'll be easy!

00:12:54.859 --> 00:12:56.994
I'll use my Marching
Fishes to taunt Gesomon

00:12:57.027 --> 00:13:00.464
until he can't stand it and
chases us on to dry land!

00:13:00.497 --> 00:13:03.000
Gomamon, is Joe gonna help you?

00:13:03.033 --> 00:13:04.501
(Gomamon humming negatively)

00:13:04.535 --> 00:13:05.502
'Fraid not.

00:13:05.536 --> 00:13:07.671
He has too much on his
mind with his studies

00:13:07.705 --> 00:13:09.740
and has no room
for anything else.

00:13:09.773 --> 00:13:11.108
And taking this on right now

00:13:11.141 --> 00:13:12.843
would be more than
he can handle.

00:13:12.877 --> 00:13:15.613
But I think he's using
his studies as an excuse.

00:13:15.646 --> 00:13:17.781
I think he's confused
about suddenly being

00:13:17.815 --> 00:13:19.783
transported to another world.

00:13:19.817 --> 00:13:21.018
So he's using his classwork

00:13:21.051 --> 00:13:23.187
to escape from this new reality.

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:25.122
But one day, I know
he'll come around

00:13:25.155 --> 00:13:26.523
and get with the program!

00:13:26.557 --> 00:13:29.360
He'll become a great human
who's here to help everyone out!

00:13:29.393 --> 00:13:31.528
That's why I'm gonna
join all of you guys.

00:13:31.562 --> 00:13:33.697
I'm helping out until
Joe takes his place

00:13:33.731 --> 00:13:36.667
with the rest of you!

00:13:41.213 --> 00:13:42.348
(water splashing)

00:13:42.381 --> 00:13:43.549
Here we go!

00:13:43.582 --> 00:13:44.884
Marching Fishes!

00:13:46.051 --> 00:13:48.787
(water splashing)

00:13:50.122 --> 00:13:53.292
(whirlpool splashing)

00:13:54.927 --> 00:13:56.362
It's here.

00:13:56.395 --> 00:13:59.565
(whirlpool splashing)

00:14:00.599 --> 00:14:02.034
Hey, Gesomon!

00:14:02.067 --> 00:14:03.435
Over here!

00:14:03.469 --> 00:14:06.906
(menacing music)

00:14:06.939 --> 00:14:08.941
(water splashing)

00:14:08.974 --> 00:14:11.210
(water bubbling)

00:14:11.243 --> 00:14:12.211
(Gomamon gasping)

00:14:12.244 --> 00:14:13.379
What's the matter?

00:14:13.412 --> 00:14:14.780
Why are you so slow?

00:14:14.813 --> 00:14:17.449
If you want me, come and get me!

00:14:17.483 --> 00:14:20.252
(menacing music)

00:14:26.158 --> 00:14:28.994
(water splashing)

00:14:29.995 --> 00:14:32.631
(Gomamon gasping)

00:14:32.665 --> 00:14:34.466
[Tai] I see the whirlpool!

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:35.467
It's working!

00:14:35.501 --> 00:14:37.202
They're both headed
right for the beach!

00:14:37.236 --> 00:14:38.570
You've got this, Gomamon!

00:14:38.604 --> 00:14:39.805
Just a little further!

00:14:39.838 --> 00:14:41.907
(projectiles firing)

00:14:41.941 --> 00:14:44.643
(water splashing)

00:14:44.677 --> 00:14:46.445
(menacing music)

00:14:46.478 --> 00:14:47.479
Gomamon...

00:14:48.514 --> 00:14:51.917
(water splashing)

00:14:51.951 --> 00:14:53.485
Almost there!

00:14:53.519 --> 00:14:56.755
(menacing music)

00:14:56.789 --> 00:14:58.490
(Gomamon screaming)

00:14:58.524 --> 00:14:59.525
Gomamon!

00:15:01.193 --> 00:15:03.495
-(Gomamon grunting in pain)
-(body thudding)

00:15:03.529 --> 00:15:04.763
(Joe gasping)

00:15:04.797 --> 00:15:05.831
Gomamon!

00:15:05.864 --> 00:15:08.100
-(footsteps crunching)
-(Joe panting)

00:15:08.133 --> 00:15:09.601
Are you okay?

00:15:09.635 --> 00:15:10.836
Talk to me!

00:15:10.869 --> 00:15:12.338
(Gomamon groaning)

00:15:12.371 --> 00:15:13.772
Hi, Joe.

00:15:13.806 --> 00:15:14.807
Listen to me, guys!

00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:16.742
The two of you are
in great danger!

00:15:16.775 --> 00:15:18.677
Hurry up and get
out of there, now!

00:15:18.711 --> 00:15:22.448
-(Gesomon roaring)
-(Joe gasping)

00:15:22.481 --> 00:15:25.317
(water splashing)

00:15:26.652 --> 00:15:29.488
(Gesomon roaring)

00:15:30.389 --> 00:15:32.324
(Joe whimpering)

00:15:32.358 --> 00:15:34.960
(water splashing)

00:15:34.994 --> 00:15:36.829
(Gesomon stomping)

00:15:36.862 --> 00:15:38.197
That's Gesomon?

00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:40.499
We only saw the
tentacles before now!

00:15:40.532 --> 00:15:42.334
Well, now we get to
see the whole thing!

00:15:42.368 --> 00:15:44.036
[Tai] Agumon, you
know what to do!

00:15:44.069 --> 00:15:45.137
[Mimi] You're up, Palmon!

00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:46.338
[Agumon And Palmon] Yeah!

00:15:46.372 --> 00:15:48.907
(heroic music)

00:15:51.744 --> 00:15:54.246
[Agumon] Agumon digivolve to

00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:57.750
(heroic music)

00:16:06.425 --> 00:16:07.426
Greymon!

00:16:09.228 --> 00:16:11.030
Palmon digivolve to

00:16:12.264 --> 00:16:14.867
(heroic music)

00:16:15.768 --> 00:16:16.769
Togemon!

00:16:18.037 --> 00:16:19.671
(Gesomon roaring)

00:16:19.705 --> 00:16:22.041
(feet stomping)

00:16:22.074 --> 00:16:24.009
(Greymon growling)

00:16:24.043 --> 00:16:26.612
(heroic music)

00:16:32.217 --> 00:16:36.021
Gomamon, why'd you
act so recklessly?

00:16:36.055 --> 00:16:38.257
I'd been waiting so long.

00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:39.758
(Joe gasping)

00:16:39.792 --> 00:16:44.797
-(Greymon stomping)
-(Greymon roaring)

00:16:45.564 --> 00:16:48.367
(Gesomon crashing)

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:50.035
Needle Spray!

00:16:50.069 --> 00:16:53.605
(needles whooshing)

00:16:53.639 --> 00:16:55.874
(fire roaring)

00:16:55.908 --> 00:16:59.278
-(ground rumbling)
-(water splashing)

00:16:59.311 --> 00:17:03.415
-(Togemon yelping)
-[Mimi] Togemon!

00:17:03.449 --> 00:17:07.553
-(Togemon grunting)
-(footsteps stomping)

00:17:07.586 --> 00:17:12.157
-(Greymon growling)
-(fire roaring)

00:17:12.558 --> 00:17:14.793
I'd always looked
forward to this.

00:17:14.827 --> 00:17:16.261
I'd wondered and wondered

00:17:16.295 --> 00:17:19.298
about what kind of human
my partner would be.

00:17:19.331 --> 00:17:22.634
And then, when I
finally found you,

00:17:22.668 --> 00:17:25.237
I was really excited and happy.

00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:27.840
(gentle music)

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:43.589
Weren't you disappointed?

00:17:43.622 --> 00:17:47.092
To find out I wasn't a brave
and adventurous human being?

00:17:47.126 --> 00:17:48.594
But that's not true!

00:17:48.627 --> 00:17:50.095
What do you mean?

00:17:50.129 --> 00:17:52.097
Just listen to me, Joe.

00:17:52.131 --> 00:17:54.700
(gentle music)

00:18:06.545 --> 00:18:09.281
I've thought about it
ever since you got here.

00:18:09.314 --> 00:18:12.618
And Joe, I've waited
for no one else but you.

00:18:12.651 --> 00:18:15.020
And I know I'm right about that.

00:18:15.053 --> 00:18:17.022
This isn't a mistake.

00:18:17.055 --> 00:18:20.125
(Greymon growling)

00:18:20.159 --> 00:18:22.294
(Greymon thudding)

00:18:22.327 --> 00:18:27.332
-(footsteps stomping)
-(Greymon growling)

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:29.868
(projectiles firing)

00:18:29.902 --> 00:18:31.370
(Greymon growling)

00:18:31.403 --> 00:18:34.473
-(projectile thudding)
-(Joe and Gomamon yelping)

00:18:34.506 --> 00:18:36.375
Hey, are you okay?

00:18:36.408 --> 00:18:38.477
I'm fine, but I'm
worried about you.

00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:40.379
You need to be able
to work with others

00:18:40.412 --> 00:18:42.981
if you wanna get things
done successfully.

00:18:43.015 --> 00:18:44.850
You have people like Tai.

00:18:44.883 --> 00:18:47.319
And of course, you have me, too.

00:18:47.352 --> 00:18:49.154
I'll always be here for you,

00:18:49.188 --> 00:18:51.023
so you don't ever have to worry!

00:18:51.056 --> 00:18:53.592
(gentle music)

00:18:57.196 --> 00:18:58.397
I know you're right.

00:18:58.430 --> 00:19:00.899
Gomamon, I've never once
been alone in this world

00:19:00.933 --> 00:19:03.569
because you've been here to
help me from the very beginning.

00:19:03.602 --> 00:19:05.170
If I had been here
all by myself,

00:19:05.204 --> 00:19:06.872
I'd probably have
been too freaked out

00:19:06.905 --> 00:19:08.874
-to even open a book.
-(Gomamon gasping)

00:19:08.907 --> 00:19:10.075
Gomamon.

00:19:10.108 --> 00:19:11.510
I know you're...

00:19:11.543 --> 00:19:13.512
(Joe sighing)

00:19:13.545 --> 00:19:15.714
I am your partner, Gomamon!

00:19:15.747 --> 00:19:18.016
(Digivice chiming)

00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:20.552
(light humming)

00:19:20.586 --> 00:19:23.088
(Joe gasping)

00:19:24.456 --> 00:19:26.558
Gomamon digivolve to...

00:19:28.894 --> 00:19:32.264
(feet stomping)

00:19:32.297 --> 00:19:35.567
(energetic rock music)

00:19:37.236 --> 00:19:40.439
(Ikkakumon roaring)

00:19:40.472 --> 00:19:41.907
Who is that?

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:45.444
(man singing in japanese)

00:19:45.477 --> 00:19:46.478
Ikkakumon!

00:19:47.746 --> 00:19:50.082
(man singing in japanese)

00:19:50.115 --> 00:19:51.116
Ikkakumon?

00:19:51.149 --> 00:19:53.218
(Gesomon roaring)

00:19:53.252 --> 00:19:56.755
(man singing in japanese)

00:19:59.625 --> 00:20:00.626
Ikkakumon!

00:20:01.426 --> 00:20:03.895
(water splashing)

00:20:03.929 --> 00:20:07.065
(water bubbling)

00:20:07.099 --> 00:20:10.235
(Ikkakumon grunting)

00:20:10.269 --> 00:20:12.738
(bodies thudding)

00:20:12.771 --> 00:20:17.609
-(bodies crashing)
-(Gesomon roaring)

00:20:17.643 --> 00:20:19.611
Oh no you don't!

00:20:19.645 --> 00:20:20.979
Harpoon Torpedo!

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:25.183
(torpedo whooshing)

00:20:27.119 --> 00:20:30.589
(torpedo exploding)

00:20:30.622 --> 00:20:33.492
(Gesomon crashing)

00:20:33.525 --> 00:20:36.328
(water splashing)

00:20:36.361 --> 00:20:37.763
Togemon!

00:20:37.796 --> 00:20:39.031
Coconut Punch!

00:20:42.801 --> 00:20:44.169
Do it, Greymon!

00:20:46.972 --> 00:20:49.474
(fire roaring)

00:20:50.842 --> 00:20:52.010
Got it!

00:20:52.044 --> 00:20:53.378
Harpoon Torpedo!

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:55.981
(tentacle whacking)

00:20:56.014 --> 00:20:59.351
(torpedo whooshing)

00:20:59.384 --> 00:21:02.888
(man singing in japanese)

(Gesomon roaring)

(energetic rock music)

00:21:17.336 --> 00:21:18.870
[Sora] Wow, Joe!

00:21:18.904 --> 00:21:20.672
That Digimon's strong!

00:21:20.706 --> 00:21:21.840
Yeah.

00:21:21.873 --> 00:21:24.476
That's my partner
you're seeing out there!

00:21:24.509 --> 00:21:28.013
(Ikkakumon roaring)

00:21:28.046 --> 00:21:29.881
(calm happy music)

00:21:29.915 --> 00:21:30.882
All right!

00:21:30.916 --> 00:21:32.818
Now that I've joined
up with the group,

00:21:32.851 --> 00:21:36.021
let's go find this Celestial
Digimon as fast as we can!

00:21:36.855 --> 00:21:37.823
Wow, Joe.

00:21:37.856 --> 00:21:40.225
You certainly changed your tune!

00:21:40.258 --> 00:21:42.394
But I still have to
pass those tests.

00:21:42.427 --> 00:21:45.163
Whoever studies all summer
will ace those exams!

00:21:45.197 --> 00:21:46.865
I'm older than the rest of you,

00:21:46.898 --> 00:21:49.534
so you should really pay
close attention to me!

00:21:49.568 --> 00:21:51.336
(Joe yelping)

00:21:51.370 --> 00:21:53.538
-(Joe screaming)
-(water splashing)

00:21:53.572 --> 00:21:54.539
He just flopped!

00:21:54.573 --> 00:21:56.208
That was a bad flop.

00:21:56.241 --> 00:21:58.009
Our poor counselor flopped!

00:21:58.043 --> 00:22:00.379
That was one serious flop!

00:22:00.412 --> 00:22:02.180
(water splashing)

00:22:02.214 --> 00:22:04.015
Stop saying I flopped, already!

00:22:04.049 --> 00:22:06.184
I'm just down here
studying for my exams!
