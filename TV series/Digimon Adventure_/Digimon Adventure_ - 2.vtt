[Narrator] In the year 2020 CE,

00:00:15.346 --> 00:00:18.182
the human world is
connected by a network.

00:00:19.267 --> 00:00:20.977
That network is inhabited

00:00:21.018 --> 00:00:25.147
by an unknown life
form called Digimon.

Tai Kamiya.

00:02:11.712 --> 00:02:15.341
He was just an ordinary boy
enjoying his summer break

00:02:15.383 --> 00:02:17.760
when the extraordinary happened.

00:02:17.802 --> 00:02:20.513
After finding out that
his family was caught

00:02:20.554 --> 00:02:23.265
in a cyber-terrorism
attack in Tokyo,

00:02:23.307 --> 00:02:26.018
he was called by
a mysterious voice

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.646
and pulled into the
world of the Network.

00:02:28.687 --> 00:02:31.023
He encountered
mysterious life forms

00:02:31.065 --> 00:02:33.442
called Digimon and then...

00:02:33.484 --> 00:02:35.653
(roaring)

00:02:37.488 --> 00:02:39.031
[Izzy] It looks like
they're targeting

00:02:39.073 --> 00:02:41.700
the American military's
tactical data network.

00:02:41.742 --> 00:02:43.369
The Digimon could
easily take control

00:02:43.411 --> 00:02:44.870
of any of their weapons.

00:02:44.912 --> 00:02:47.706
If that happens, it could
lead to all-out war!

00:02:47.748 --> 00:02:50.668
It would mean the
end of the world!

00:02:53.337 --> 00:02:54.547
(roaring)

00:02:54.588 --> 00:02:56.340
[Tai] Hey, hold up!

00:02:57.591 --> 00:03:00.928
(dramatic techno music)

00:03:06.684 --> 00:03:07.685
Huh?

00:03:08.727 --> 00:03:11.230
[Gururumon] Howling blaster!

00:03:23.075 --> 00:03:25.578
You owe me one for that.

00:03:25.619 --> 00:03:29.290
[Greymon] Hm. So you're
still around, huh?

00:03:31.542 --> 00:03:33.752
[Tai] That kid is human, right?

00:03:33.794 --> 00:03:35.880
Maybe not the
friendliest human, but...

00:03:35.921 --> 00:03:37.631
Gururumon, let's
get out of here.

00:03:38.883 --> 00:03:40.217
[Gururumon] Are you sure?

00:03:42.803 --> 00:03:44.555
We have to go. Now.

00:03:45.473 --> 00:03:48.559
(Gururumon growling)

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:52.980
[Greymon] Tai.

00:03:54.648 --> 00:03:56.358
We should get out of here too.

00:04:04.492 --> 00:04:05.910
Either they're
trying to ditch us

00:04:05.951 --> 00:04:07.286
or they're super fast!

00:04:07.328 --> 00:04:08.329
Or both.

00:04:10.748 --> 00:04:12.249
[Tai] Here they are again!

00:04:12.291 --> 00:04:13.542
They're coming our way.

00:04:13.584 --> 00:04:14.543
Greymon!

00:04:14.585 --> 00:04:15.753
[Greymon] Nova Blast!

00:04:17.755 --> 00:04:20.090
(explosion)

00:04:24.011 --> 00:04:26.722
I guess I don't owe you
one anymore! (laughing)

00:04:26.764 --> 00:04:29.350
Is Greymon cool or
is Greymon cool?

00:04:30.851 --> 00:04:32.436
Looks like you guys are
trying to stop those

00:04:32.478 --> 00:04:34.980
wild Digimon too,
isn't that right?

00:04:35.022 --> 00:04:36.565
We oughta just work together.

00:04:36.607 --> 00:04:40.069
My name's Tai Kamiya,
but you can call me Tai!

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.196
Or just sit there in silence...

00:04:43.864 --> 00:04:46.075
Hey Izzy! You watching this?

00:04:46.116 --> 00:04:47.117
I made a friend!

00:04:48.619 --> 00:04:51.997
[Izzy] Oh! Hi there,
it's nice to meet you.

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:54.667
And my name is Koshiro Izumi.

00:04:54.708 --> 00:04:56.835
Just where is this
friend of yours?

00:04:56.877 --> 00:04:58.462
[Tai] Musashi-Kosugi Station.

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:01.173
What, haven't you heard of it?

00:05:01.215 --> 00:05:02.258
Where are you from?

00:05:02.299 --> 00:05:03.342
(Izzy gasps)

00:05:03.384 --> 00:05:05.261
[Izzy] Uh, Tai? I don't
think we have time

00:05:05.302 --> 00:05:07.638
for that now. I'm
getting a clearer picture

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.098
of the military crisis.

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:10.307
[Tai] How's it looking?

00:05:12.101 --> 00:05:13.519
[Izzy] I think they've
lost control of their

00:05:13.561 --> 00:05:16.939
command systems because
of these attacks.

00:05:16.981 --> 00:05:18.607
And this hasn't been confirmed,

00:05:18.649 --> 00:05:21.569
but their defense programs
don't seem to be working either.

00:05:22.528 --> 00:05:24.196
This isn't looking too good.

00:05:24.238 --> 00:05:26.031
How do you know all of this?

00:05:26.073 --> 00:05:28.450
Because knowing stuff
is just what Izzy does.

00:05:28.492 --> 00:05:30.160
He's like a human search engine!

00:05:31.245 --> 00:05:33.122
[Izzy] Well, it's more
like I'm connected

00:05:33.163 --> 00:05:35.499
to some people who
are web experts,

00:05:35.541 --> 00:05:37.334
and if there's something
I can't find on my own,

00:05:37.376 --> 00:05:39.503
they'll tell me
what I need to know.

00:05:39.545 --> 00:05:40.963
Hey, wait a second.

00:05:41.005 --> 00:05:43.799
Isn't all that stuff actually
classified information?

00:05:43.841 --> 00:05:45.551
Let's worry about
what's classified

00:05:45.593 --> 00:05:47.553
after we save the world.

00:05:47.595 --> 00:05:49.972
Come on, tell the truth,
don't you think we'll be

00:05:50.014 --> 00:05:52.766
stronger if we formed a
team and worked together?

00:05:54.518 --> 00:05:56.562
(sighing)

00:05:56.604 --> 00:05:57.855
[Kid] You're Izumi, right?

00:05:57.896 --> 00:05:59.023
Uh, that's right.

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:01.442
This guy's name is Gururumon.

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:04.570
And my name is Matt Ishida.

00:06:05.571 --> 00:06:07.698
I look forward to
seeing what you can do.

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:09.366
Of course! Anything
you need, Matt!

00:06:09.408 --> 00:06:10.868
(Tai laughing)

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:13.495
Yeah, all right! We're gonna
be the tightest team ever!

00:06:13.537 --> 00:06:16.332
So let's all work together
and we can totally-

00:06:16.373 --> 00:06:18.000
Hey, stop!

00:06:18.042 --> 00:06:19.835
Working together means
we gotta, you know,

00:06:19.877 --> 00:06:22.921
like be together?
Are you kidding me?

00:06:22.963 --> 00:06:24.006
[Matt] Hey, Izumi.

00:06:24.048 --> 00:06:25.299
[Izzy] Huh?

00:06:25.341 --> 00:06:26.842
[Matt] Can you tell me
what's happening with that

00:06:26.884 --> 00:06:28.344
military right now?

00:06:28.385 --> 00:06:30.262
[Izzy] Uh, yeah! Sure!

00:06:30.304 --> 00:06:32.389
It looks like the
military's trying to regain

00:06:32.431 --> 00:06:34.350
control of their
systems, but they haven't

00:06:34.391 --> 00:06:36.101
been able to make
any progress yet.

00:06:37.144 --> 00:06:39.772
So, Matt. Do you have one of
these controller things too?

00:06:39.813 --> 00:06:41.023
[Matt] Yeah, Izumi, I do.

00:06:41.065 --> 00:06:43.567
[Izzy] Actually, you
can just call me Izzy.

00:06:43.609 --> 00:06:47.279
Who is Matt? Where'd
he come from, anyway?

00:06:47.321 --> 00:06:49.948
I kinda get the feeling
he knows a lot more about

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:51.408
this world than we do.

00:06:54.787 --> 00:06:55.746
(computer notification sound)

00:06:55.788 --> 00:06:57.289
(Izzy gasping)

00:06:57.331 --> 00:06:59.291
[Izzy] I've just received
some alarming information

00:06:59.333 --> 00:07:00.417
Huh?

00:07:00.459 --> 00:07:01.877
[Izzy] People are
saying something about

00:07:01.919 --> 00:07:04.046
a nuclear submarine.

00:07:04.088 --> 00:07:06.006
Yeah, what about it?

00:07:08.592 --> 00:07:10.594
HQ! We have an emergency!

00:07:10.636 --> 00:07:13.138
We've lost control of
the sub's navigation.

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:14.890
It's now completely
out of our hands,

00:07:14.932 --> 00:07:16.850
we're rapidly
approaching the surface!

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:20.813
Captain! The missile launch
control system is activating!

00:07:20.854 --> 00:07:21.855
[Captain] What?

00:07:23.148 --> 00:07:25.484
The information I'm getting
says a nuclear submarine

00:07:25.526 --> 00:07:27.152
in the Atlantic has
recently received

00:07:27.194 --> 00:07:28.487
a command to attack!

00:07:31.365 --> 00:07:33.158
It's preparing to
launch a missile!

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:34.993
What? No way!

00:07:35.035 --> 00:07:36.787
Izzy, when's it gonna launch?

00:07:36.829 --> 00:07:38.414
And what's its target?

00:07:38.455 --> 00:07:40.165
Sorry, I only have
bits and pieces

00:07:40.207 --> 00:07:41.667
of information right now.

00:07:41.709 --> 00:07:43.752
[Matt] Izzy, can you
tell me the location

00:07:43.794 --> 00:07:45.462
over here that's
responsible for controlling

00:07:45.504 --> 00:07:46.922
that missile launch?

00:07:46.964 --> 00:07:49.633
The Digimon causing this
should be in that area.

00:07:49.675 --> 00:07:50.843
(Izzy gasps)

00:07:50.884 --> 00:07:52.761
[Izzy] If I analyze all
the information that

00:07:52.803 --> 00:07:55.180
I've gotten up until
now, I may be able to

00:07:55.222 --> 00:07:57.307
find a route into
the military system.

00:07:58.308 --> 00:08:00.978
Strike that, I will find it!

00:08:01.019 --> 00:08:03.188
I just need you to
give me some time.

00:08:04.022 --> 00:08:06.483
Alright, Izzy. We're
counting on you!

00:08:08.402 --> 00:08:14.825
(suspenseful techno music)

00:08:28.172 --> 00:08:30.507
I've got it! I found a route in.

00:08:30.549 --> 00:08:32.342
Nice job, Izzy! Way to go!

00:08:34.219 --> 00:08:35.554
[Izzy] I've plotted
a course there from

00:08:35.596 --> 00:08:37.431
both of your locations.

00:08:37.473 --> 00:08:39.391
Just follow this route
and you'll get there

00:08:39.433 --> 00:08:40.601
as fast as possible.

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:44.396
There isn't much time left now.

00:08:44.438 --> 00:08:46.190
Good luck you guys!

00:08:46.231 --> 00:08:47.232
We're on it, Izzy!

00:08:48.192 --> 00:08:49.568
Let's go, Greymon!

00:08:50.527 --> 00:08:51.612
You got it!

00:08:53.197 --> 00:08:56.867
(dramatic orchestral music)

00:09:08.879 --> 00:09:11.548
(alarm blaring)

00:09:21.099 --> 00:09:22.935
You okay, Tai?

00:09:22.976 --> 00:09:24.478
I think so. Huh?

00:09:28.732 --> 00:09:30.442
[Izzy] Tai, what
you're looking at is

00:09:30.484 --> 00:09:31.985
the missile system's network.

00:09:32.027 --> 00:09:34.404
You have to get rid of
the Digimon causing this.

00:09:34.446 --> 00:09:36.114
There's only two
minutes and ten seconds

00:09:36.156 --> 00:09:37.950
until the missile is launched!

00:09:37.991 --> 00:09:40.744
[Tai] Yeah, no pressure, right?

00:09:45.332 --> 00:09:46.750
Here they come!

00:09:58.679 --> 00:10:00.430
We'll never get through

00:10:00.472 --> 00:10:01.807
this many fast enough!

00:10:04.685 --> 00:10:06.436
Is that the boss?

00:10:07.604 --> 00:10:09.690
Well, it is the
biggest one here.

00:10:10.816 --> 00:10:13.151
(explosion)

00:10:15.028 --> 00:10:17.781
(dramatic music)

00:10:20.284 --> 00:10:22.786
Alright, go on! Attack!

00:10:22.828 --> 00:10:24.580
Hey wait, Matt!

00:10:24.621 --> 00:10:26.415
Just stay there!

00:10:26.456 --> 00:10:27.541
[Tai] Why?!

00:10:30.377 --> 00:10:33.005
(lasers firing)

00:10:35.549 --> 00:10:37.467
He doesn't want help?

00:10:38.343 --> 00:10:39.887
What's he thinking?

00:10:45.642 --> 00:10:49.479
Tai, look! That big
one's wide open now!

00:10:49.521 --> 00:10:52.399
It's an invitation to
a smack down party!

00:10:54.067 --> 00:10:56.695
[Tai] Now I get what Matt
and Gururumon are doing.

00:10:58.822 --> 00:11:00.741
This is just what
they were aiming for.

00:11:03.535 --> 00:11:06.371
(Greymon roaring)

00:11:10.083 --> 00:11:11.084
Let's go.

00:11:12.252 --> 00:11:15.422
(upbeat techno music)

00:11:19.843 --> 00:11:22.512
Only one minute and fifty
seconds left until launch

00:11:27.517 --> 00:11:32.522
Now go!

00:11:33.273 --> 00:11:34.775
[Greymon] Nova Blast!

00:11:39.237 --> 00:11:41.698
[Gururumon] Howling Blaster!

00:11:52.459 --> 00:11:53.794
Yeah, got him!

00:12:00.384 --> 00:12:01.843
Well, that wasn't so hard.

00:12:01.885 --> 00:12:04.054
As far as, you know,
saving the world goes.

00:12:05.222 --> 00:12:07.057
I figured out what
you were doing.

00:12:07.099 --> 00:12:08.725
I mean, eventually.

00:12:08.767 --> 00:12:10.268
But it would've been
easier if you just

00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:11.770
said something first!

00:12:11.812 --> 00:12:13.271
Huh?

00:12:13.313 --> 00:12:14.481
It's not over.

00:12:16.066 --> 00:12:18.318
(rumbling)

00:12:22.948 --> 00:12:25.909
(orchestral music)

00:13:06.992 --> 00:13:09.411
It digivolved again.

00:13:09.453 --> 00:13:10.787
How many times

00:13:11.955 --> 00:13:14.291
do we have to beat this guy?

00:13:19.504 --> 00:13:20.714
Hey Matt, wait!

00:13:20.756 --> 00:13:22.299
[Greymon] Yeah, so
he's not waiting.

00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:23.508
[Tai] Clearly!

00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:25.010
Come on, let's go Greymon!

00:13:25.052 --> 00:13:26.053
Yeah!

00:13:37.522 --> 00:13:38.940
Greymon, go!

00:13:38.982 --> 00:13:41.902
(Greymon grunting)

00:13:54.915 --> 00:13:59.920
Oh no, Matt!

00:14:04.758 --> 00:14:06.343
[Izzy] Tai! Matt!

00:14:13.558 --> 00:14:14.726
Gururumon!

00:14:14.768 --> 00:14:16.103
[Tai] Greymon!

00:14:24.528 --> 00:14:28.824
Matt, listen. We can't
win by fighting alone.

00:14:28.865 --> 00:14:31.910
But, if we work together
again, we can beat anything!

00:14:31.952 --> 00:14:34.621
So why weren't we able
to finish it off earlier?

00:14:36.456 --> 00:14:37.874
You guys, there's no time left,

00:14:37.916 --> 00:14:39.376
the missile's just
about to launch!

00:14:39.417 --> 00:14:42.045
We need to find a way
to stop it somehow.

00:14:47.259 --> 00:14:49.553
(grunting)

00:14:53.473 --> 00:14:54.808
[Tai] Greymon!

00:15:00.147 --> 00:15:03.275
Come on, Matt. You know
a way we can win, right?

00:15:03.316 --> 00:15:04.317
Then let's do it!

00:15:06.486 --> 00:15:09.281
The only way I know
is too dangerous.

00:15:09.322 --> 00:15:11.074
Best case scenario, it works out

00:15:11.116 --> 00:15:13.451
but it's a double-edged sword.

00:15:13.493 --> 00:15:15.537
If we fail, who knows
what will happen

00:15:15.579 --> 00:15:16.913
to Gururumon and Greymon.

00:15:21.168 --> 00:15:23.712
That's a chance I'm
willing to take.

00:15:23.753 --> 00:15:24.754
[Tai] You sure?

00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:29.593
[Gururumon] After all,
there's no other way, right?

00:15:31.011 --> 00:15:33.471
Whatever happens,
we can handle it.

00:15:36.183 --> 00:15:39.060
[Tai] You know
what? You're right.

00:15:39.102 --> 00:15:41.938
There's nothing we can't do
if we put our heads together.

00:15:42.856 --> 00:15:43.857
I'm not worried

00:15:44.858 --> 00:15:47.152
because I've got
faith in Greymon.

00:15:48.945 --> 00:15:50.822
And you've got faith too!

00:15:50.864 --> 00:15:52.574
In Gururumon.

00:15:52.616 --> 00:15:55.035
(epic music)

00:16:01.374 --> 00:16:03.501
[Tai] Go get him, Greymon!
I'm counting on you.

00:16:03.543 --> 00:16:04.836
Leave it to me!

00:16:04.878 --> 00:16:05.837
[Matt] Gururumon, go!

00:16:05.879 --> 00:16:06.880
[Gururumon] Right!

00:16:16.556 --> 00:16:18.725
Yeah, keep up the
barrage Greymon!

00:16:25.649 --> 00:16:27.067
[Matt] Now, Gururumon!

00:16:32.989 --> 00:16:35.158
(roaring)

00:16:42.916 --> 00:16:45.293
Good call using those
ultra close-range attacks.

00:16:45.335 --> 00:16:46.336
Gururumon!

00:16:48.338 --> 00:16:50.340
Greymon, go!

00:16:52.217 --> 00:16:54.052
[Tai and Matt] Fire!

00:17:05.063 --> 00:17:07.732
(grunting)

00:17:24.708 --> 00:17:26.876
(Tai laughing)

00:17:41.641 --> 00:17:42.892
[Izzy] It's not over!

00:17:44.144 --> 00:17:45.979
That beast's not done!

00:17:52.819 --> 00:17:55.488
(timer beeping)

00:18:09.085 --> 00:18:11.921
(missile soaring)

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:18.470
You guys, the missile,

00:18:19.929 --> 00:18:21.681
it's been launched.
We're too late.

00:18:47.791 --> 00:18:49.667
Wait, what's
happening? What now?

00:18:49.709 --> 00:18:51.920
We have to end this.

00:18:51.961 --> 00:18:53.088
[Tai] Greymon!

00:18:53.129 --> 00:18:55.048
[Greymon] Nova Blast!

00:18:56.466 --> 00:18:57.967
Howling Blaster!

00:19:03.973 --> 00:19:06.267
(Izzy typing quickly)

00:19:06.309 --> 00:19:08.186
[Izzy] If I can extrapolate
the missile's path

00:19:08.228 --> 00:19:10.188
based on its initial
trajectory...

00:19:12.482 --> 00:19:14.901
(Izzy gasps)

00:19:17.195 --> 00:19:18.947
Are you kidding me right now?

00:19:18.988 --> 00:19:20.031
[Izzy] Tai.

00:19:20.073 --> 00:19:21.533
Huh?

00:19:21.574 --> 00:19:24.411
I think I just figured out
where the missile's heading.

00:19:25.495 --> 00:19:26.454
[Tai] Where?

00:19:26.496 --> 00:19:27.664
It's heading right toward

00:19:28.998 --> 00:19:29.999
Tokyo!

00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:36.881
[Tai] What?!

00:19:36.923 --> 00:19:38.425
[Izzy] If this missile hits,

00:19:39.926 --> 00:19:41.261
then Tokyo will...

00:19:42.595 --> 00:19:44.931
Tokyo will be
completely annihilated!

00:20:02.115 --> 00:20:05.034
(orchestral music)

00:20:09.247 --> 00:20:12.000
(grunting)

00:20:12.041 --> 00:20:16.296
[Tai] We've got to find
a way to beat this thing!

00:20:24.304 --> 00:20:26.473
(buzzing)

00:20:32.228 --> 00:20:34.355
If we don't stop
this guy right now,

00:20:34.397 --> 00:20:37.358
then Tokyo is
gonna be destroyed.

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:40.612
No. No way. I'll stop
this thing no matter what.

00:20:42.822 --> 00:20:44.282
No one else can do this.

00:20:46.618 --> 00:20:48.995
We are the only ones
who can stop it.

00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:53.041
And we are.

00:20:53.082 --> 00:20:54.417
Let's do this.

00:20:59.297 --> 00:21:00.298
Tai, no!

00:21:14.687 --> 00:21:15.688
Tai...

00:21:20.777 --> 00:21:21.778
Huh?

00:21:25.281 --> 00:21:26.324
What is this?

[Narrator] A missile
is closing in on Tokyo.

00:23:13.473 --> 00:23:15.767
Can the new Digimon
work a miracle

00:23:15.808 --> 00:23:17.852
and defeat their powerful enemy?

00:23:17.894 --> 00:23:20.021

Digimon Adventure:

00:23:20.063 --> 00:23:21.606
And to the Digital World!

00:23:21.648 --> 00:23:24.400
[Narrator] The adventure
