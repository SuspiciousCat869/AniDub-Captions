[Narrator] In the year 2020 C.E.

00:00:15.743 --> 00:00:19.180
the human world is
connected by a network.

00:00:19.214 --> 00:00:23.851
That network is inhabited
by an unknown life form,

00:00:23.885 --> 00:00:25.553
called Digimon.

00:00:27.055 --> 00:00:29.757

[Narrator] In the Digital World,

00:02:15.071 --> 00:02:19.409
Tai reunites with his
Digimon partner, Agumon.

00:02:19.442 --> 00:02:23.413
Tai's classmate Sora
has also joined them.

00:02:23.446 --> 00:02:26.249
And so their journey to
find a way to save Tokyo

00:02:26.282 --> 00:02:29.085
from coming to a
halt has now begun.

00:02:29.118 --> 00:02:31.087
All the while,
Izzy wanders around

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.222
inside the Digital Network.

00:02:33.256 --> 00:02:36.092
Sora meets her partner Biyomon.

00:02:36.125 --> 00:02:38.428
who digivolves to save her.

00:02:38.461 --> 00:02:41.264
(Birdramon screeching)

00:02:41.297 --> 00:02:43.266
The children manage
to fight off attacks

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:45.268
from some wild Digimon.

00:02:47.637 --> 00:02:50.073
And soon after they
follow the directions

00:02:50.106 --> 00:02:53.643
of a mysterious voice, but
where will it lead them?

00:02:53.743 --> 00:02:55.378
Is it some kind of a temple?

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:57.480
Huh?

00:02:58.281 --> 00:02:59.682
(screams)

00:03:16.132 --> 00:03:18.801
(runes humming)

00:03:26.476 --> 00:03:29.479
It says, "Feel my words."

00:03:29.512 --> 00:03:31.114
Here goes.

00:03:31.147 --> 00:03:33.816
(runes humming)

00:03:48.531 --> 00:03:49.966
[Tentomon] You sure
have guts, Izzy.

00:03:49.999 --> 00:03:51.634
You never stop working.

00:03:51.667 --> 00:03:54.470
Even when we're in
the gut of a Digimon!

00:03:54.504 --> 00:03:57.507
Look, I'm still able to
connect to the internet.

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:58.641
And that's more than enough

00:03:58.674 --> 00:04:00.843
to be able to find the
information we need.

00:04:00.877 --> 00:04:02.979
Once we get a better
idea of what's going on

00:04:03.012 --> 00:04:05.148
in the outside world, I'll
be able to narrow down

00:04:05.181 --> 00:04:06.649
what our next moves should be.

00:04:06.682 --> 00:04:07.850
[Tentomon] Great idea!

00:04:07.884 --> 00:04:09.852
You know, you are
one smart cookie.

00:04:09.886 --> 00:04:12.989
Hey Tentomon, what
Digimon are we inside of?

00:04:13.022 --> 00:04:15.024
This is Whamon,
he's super chill.

00:04:15.057 --> 00:04:17.160
Even though he just,
you know, ate us.

00:04:17.193 --> 00:04:19.529
He usually just swims
around the Network all day.

00:04:19.562 --> 00:04:21.697
Goodness gracious, what's that?

00:04:21.731 --> 00:04:24.033
Tai, is that you?

00:04:24.066 --> 00:04:26.836
Something just lit up
over here on my end!

00:04:26.869 --> 00:04:29.872
It looks like some kind
of Digimon with wings?

00:04:29.906 --> 00:04:32.575
(runes humming)

00:04:38.714 --> 00:04:40.583
This feeling is so familiar.

00:04:41.884 --> 00:04:43.252
I feel so warm.

00:04:48.925 --> 00:04:51.694
[Valdurmon] You've
finally arrived.

00:04:51.727 --> 00:04:54.197
Children who possess
the Digivice,

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:56.599
we have been waiting for you.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.036
[Tai] You mean, this thing?

00:05:00.069 --> 00:05:02.738
[Valdurmon] We are the ones
who govern all that is good

00:05:02.772 --> 00:05:05.074
within the realm of
the Digital World.

00:05:05.107 --> 00:05:07.210
With the last of our powers,

00:05:07.243 --> 00:05:11.914
we bestow upon you the knowledge
of how this all came to be.

00:05:11.948 --> 00:05:15.551
Long ago, a large war was
waged in the Digital World.

00:05:15.585 --> 00:05:19.922
This is the place that
became our final stronghold.

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:24.093
(energy humming)

00:05:33.436 --> 00:05:34.437
-Huh?
-Huh?

00:05:41.811 --> 00:05:43.913
[Valdurmon] There was
light and darkness

00:05:43.946 --> 00:05:45.748
in the Digital World.

00:05:45.781 --> 00:05:48.618
Then Darkness broke
the continued balance

00:05:48.651 --> 00:05:53.589
between the opposing powers
and began to make its move.

00:05:53.623 --> 00:05:54.590
(Agumon growls)

00:05:54.624 --> 00:05:55.658
What is it?

00:05:55.691 --> 00:05:59.829
I dunno why, but these
things give me the creeps.

00:06:02.465 --> 00:06:03.599
Biyomon..

00:06:03.633 --> 00:06:06.135
I don't like their energy.

00:06:06.168 --> 00:06:09.472
[Valdurmon] The darkness
soon infested the world...

00:06:09.505 --> 00:06:11.974
We went to battle against them,

00:06:12.008 --> 00:06:14.810
fighting with all
the power we had.

00:06:14.844 --> 00:06:18.314
Our bravest warriors
fought alongside us...

00:06:21.684 --> 00:06:24.520
(explosion booms)

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:44.040
And so

00:06:47.877 --> 00:06:50.880
(children groaning)

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:59.355
Darkness was defeated.

00:07:00.523 --> 00:07:03.659
But, the damages we
sustained were great,

00:07:03.693 --> 00:07:06.896
and our existence
was nearly wiped out.

00:07:23.713 --> 00:07:24.680
Agumon?

00:07:24.714 --> 00:07:26.682
Why are you crying, Biyomon?

00:07:26.716 --> 00:07:28.050
I wish I knew.

00:07:31.253 --> 00:07:33.189
I can't explain it either,

00:07:33.222 --> 00:07:36.359
but I just feel like
crying right now.

00:07:36.392 --> 00:07:37.860
Don't worry about it!

00:07:37.893 --> 00:07:39.528
I'll hold you till
you feel better.

00:07:39.562 --> 00:07:40.563
Okay.

00:07:41.897 --> 00:07:44.033
[Valdurmon] Although
we were victorious,

00:07:44.066 --> 00:07:48.237
we believed a new darkness would
be born in the near future.

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:51.907
That when the Dark Digimon
begin making their move

00:07:51.941 --> 00:07:53.909
the ones who possess power

00:07:53.943 --> 00:07:57.213
will appear to resurrect
the warriors' souls

00:07:57.246 --> 00:07:58.881
and to guide them.

00:07:58.914 --> 00:08:00.716
And slowly but surely

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:03.252
they will learn how to
accumulate their power.

00:08:03.285 --> 00:08:07.723
Through fighting, they will
grow and mature into new forms.

00:08:07.757 --> 00:08:10.226
This is the life of Digimon.

00:08:10.259 --> 00:08:14.430
All who are born within the
Digital World follow one law,

00:08:14.463 --> 00:08:16.065
to digivolve.

00:08:16.098 --> 00:08:19.735
Those who Digivolve will
eventually reach completion,

00:08:19.769 --> 00:08:24.106
but what lies beyond them
are infinite possibilities.

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:28.077
[Tai] Like that white
Digimon from before.

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:29.912
What are you talking about, Tai?

00:08:29.945 --> 00:08:32.581
You mean you don't remember?

00:08:32.615 --> 00:08:34.784
[Valdurmon] As our
lives came to an end,

00:08:34.817 --> 00:08:38.454
we had a mysterious
vision of the future.

00:08:38.487 --> 00:08:43.426
We saw a power that surpasses
the law of digivolving.

00:08:43.459 --> 00:08:46.595
Wielded by the ones who
descend to this world

00:08:46.629 --> 00:08:50.766
with the Digivices'
light in their hands.

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:55.471
The human children who fight
and walk alongside Digimon.

00:08:57.139 --> 00:08:59.942
They are without a
doubt our last hope

00:08:59.975 --> 00:09:03.112
to protect the world
after we perish.

00:09:03.145 --> 00:09:05.981
They are the Digi-destined

00:09:06.015 --> 00:09:07.450
Does that mean us?

00:09:07.483 --> 00:09:08.651
[Valdurmon] But beware,

00:09:08.684 --> 00:09:11.787
the Network created
from human hands

00:09:11.821 --> 00:09:14.957
Connects the Digital
World with the human world

00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:18.994
and it is a territory where
our eyes cannot reach.

00:09:19.028 --> 00:09:22.498
If the darkness cannot be
stopped in the Digital World,

00:09:22.531 --> 00:09:24.967
its effects will spread
through the Network

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.137
and bring cataclysmic
disaster to the human world.

00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:30.306
[Tai] Doesn't that sound like
what's been happening lately

00:09:30.339 --> 00:09:31.307
in our world?

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:32.475
Yeah!

00:09:32.508 --> 00:09:33.642
Tai, look!

00:09:33.676 --> 00:09:37.480
Half of Tokyo is
already without power.

00:09:37.513 --> 00:09:39.482
Huh, that's weird.

00:09:39.515 --> 00:09:42.184
Each power station's main
systems aren't functioning,

00:09:42.218 --> 00:09:44.487
but for some strange
reason they don't appear

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:48.023
to be cutting the power
like they should be able to.

00:09:48.057 --> 00:09:50.659
And if the power outage
has spread this much,

00:09:50.693 --> 00:09:52.328
how is the Internet
still working like

00:09:52.361 --> 00:09:53.562
nothing has happened?

00:09:54.864 --> 00:09:56.565
(Izzy and Tentomon groaning)

00:10:01.704 --> 00:10:04.874
(explosions booming)

00:10:07.376 --> 00:10:08.344
What's going on?

00:10:08.377 --> 00:10:10.012
[Tentomon] Whamon, I
thought you were chill!

00:10:10.045 --> 00:10:11.180
Hey, Izzy!

00:10:11.213 --> 00:10:14.049
(lasers blasting)

00:10:16.385 --> 00:10:21.891
(dramatic music)

00:10:51.921 --> 00:10:54.256
[Valdurmon] Children,
we aren't the only ones

00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:57.226
who have taken notice
to your existence.

00:10:57.259 --> 00:11:02.064
The darkness has noticed as
well and will rise against you.

00:11:02.097 --> 00:11:06.268
To triumph over darkness
you must listen closely

00:11:06.302 --> 00:11:08.904
I will tell what to do.

00:11:08.938 --> 00:11:12.107
Set out from here
and cross the sea.

00:11:12.141 --> 00:11:15.077
Continue moving forward
with your Digimon

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:17.746
until you arrive
at the Continent.

00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:19.448
It is there that you will meet

00:11:19.481 --> 00:11:24.486
the light and hope of our world
who fight amongst warriors.

00:11:25.287 --> 00:11:27.756
The Celestial Digimon.

00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:29.458
Celestial Digimon?

00:11:30.626 --> 00:11:33.262
[Valdurmon] Remember,
the Cloud Continent

00:11:33.295 --> 00:11:36.799
is where you'll find
the Celestial Digimon.

00:11:37.833 --> 00:11:41.303
(lasers blasting)

00:11:41.337 --> 00:11:44.640
(Sora and Tai groaning)

00:11:44.673 --> 00:11:45.674
Watch out!

00:11:51.814 --> 00:11:53.015
Tai, over here!

00:11:56.819 --> 00:11:59.288
Those Digimon are Dokugumon!

00:11:59.321 --> 00:12:00.990
There sure are a lot of 'em!

00:12:01.023 --> 00:12:02.458
There's no way!

00:12:02.491 --> 00:12:05.494
I've never seen so many of
them work together like this!

00:12:05.527 --> 00:12:07.496
Normally they would
just lie their nests

00:12:07.529 --> 00:12:10.299
and wait for prey
to come to them.

00:12:10.332 --> 00:12:12.334
[Sora] Well, it seems
we're completely trapped.

00:12:12.368 --> 00:12:14.136
[Biyomon] Something
isn't right here.

00:12:14.169 --> 00:12:15.671
There has to be
some sort of reason

00:12:15.704 --> 00:12:18.307
that the Dokugumon
are acting like this!

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:20.009
Well, if this isn't
how they normally hunt,

00:12:20.042 --> 00:12:21.644
then that means it
wasn't just an accident

00:12:21.677 --> 00:12:22.678
that they found us.

00:12:22.711 --> 00:12:24.847
Do you think they went
out looking for us?

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:27.349
Remember what that
voice said earlier?

00:12:27.383 --> 00:12:30.019
That a new darkness
would be born...

00:12:30.052 --> 00:12:33.188
Has it already noticed our
existence and made its move?

00:12:33.222 --> 00:12:34.690
And if so...

00:12:34.723 --> 00:12:37.893
Children found, no escape.

00:12:39.528 --> 00:12:42.197
(dramatic music)

00:12:43.532 --> 00:12:46.535
(explosions booming)

00:12:46.568 --> 00:12:47.836
(Izzy yelling)

00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:50.506
[Tentomon] I'm coming, Izzy!

00:12:50.539 --> 00:12:51.540
Gotcha!

00:12:51.907 --> 00:12:54.677
Thanks, Tentomon, I owe you one.

00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:58.514
Do you have any idea how
to get us out of Whamon?

00:12:58.547 --> 00:13:00.049
[Tentomon] Sorry
about this, Whamon.

00:13:00.082 --> 00:13:02.351
Bear with us for just a second.

00:13:02.384 --> 00:13:04.687
Tickle, tickle, tickle.

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:07.890
(Whamon groans)

00:13:07.923 --> 00:13:11.727
(Izzy and Tentomon shouting)

00:13:15.564 --> 00:13:19.234
Must've been those Tylomon
causing Whamon all that trouble!

00:13:19.268 --> 00:13:22.204
But it looks like we're
their primary target now!

00:13:22.237 --> 00:13:24.239
Tentomon, let's try and
divert their attention

00:13:24.273 --> 00:13:25.541
away from Whamon!

00:13:25.574 --> 00:13:27.209
[Tentomon] How kind of you.

00:13:27.242 --> 00:13:28.877
Let's do it!

00:13:28.911 --> 00:13:31.914
Whamon, now's your
chance to run!

00:13:32.915 --> 00:13:35.617
(dramatic music)

00:13:42.791 --> 00:13:43.759
The odds are against us

00:13:43.792 --> 00:13:45.728
if we're backed into
a corner down here.

00:13:45.761 --> 00:13:48.397
Looks like the only way out
is busting through that web!

00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:50.065
Let's do it!

00:13:50.099 --> 00:13:51.266
Pepper Breath!

00:13:58.107 --> 00:14:00.109
Wait, huh, it didn't work?

00:14:00.142 --> 00:14:01.410
[Tai] What, why not?

00:14:01.443 --> 00:14:03.112
[Agumon] There's something
weird going on here.

00:14:03.145 --> 00:14:05.914
This no ordinary web. If you
look close, it's shaking.

00:14:05.948 --> 00:14:08.617
[Sora] And what's with that
weird high pitched noise?

00:14:08.650 --> 00:14:11.253
That sound must be causing
the web to vibrate.

00:14:11.286 --> 00:14:13.255
Which must be why
Agumon's Pepper Breath

00:14:13.288 --> 00:14:14.957
barely even had an effect.

00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:16.425
Then there's gotta be
something else here

00:14:16.458 --> 00:14:18.627
helping out the Dokugumon.

00:14:20.496 --> 00:14:22.798
[Biyomon] Spiral Twister!

00:14:23.799 --> 00:14:24.967
You saved us...

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.604
Agumon's not the only
one who can fight here!

00:14:28.637 --> 00:14:33.008
I'll find a way to break
this web, just wait and see!

00:14:35.177 --> 00:14:37.104
Huh?

00:14:44.528 --> 00:14:47.631
[Tentomon] Umm, what exactly
are you doing there, Izzy?

00:14:47.664 --> 00:14:49.299
I'm analyzing.

00:14:49.333 --> 00:14:51.969
If I'm able to predict the
Tylomon's movement patterns,

00:14:52.002 --> 00:14:55.506
then I can find an
opening for us to attack.

00:14:55.539 --> 00:14:58.142
Wait a second, what is that?

00:14:58.175 --> 00:15:00.177
There's some kind of
other Digimon here.

00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:02.479
[Tentomon] Really? Lemme see!

00:15:02.513 --> 00:15:05.349
(Digimon beeping)

00:15:07.718 --> 00:15:08.719
Huh?

00:15:11.221 --> 00:15:13.657
There, that's the Digimon!

00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:15.659
[Tentomon] Oh you
mean Soundbirdmon?

00:15:15.692 --> 00:15:17.528
Talk about a troublemaker,

00:15:17.561 --> 00:15:20.831
he uses sound to cause
all kinds of mischief!

00:15:20.864 --> 00:15:22.166
Soundbirdmon?

00:15:22.199 --> 00:15:23.867
Maybe he's controlling
the Tylomon

00:15:23.901 --> 00:15:25.502
with the soundwaves he creates!

00:15:25.536 --> 00:15:28.172
[Tentomon] Don't look now,
but they're gaining on us!

00:15:28.205 --> 00:15:30.174
Tentomon, there's still
a way for you to escape

00:15:30.207 --> 00:15:31.842
if you just let go of me.

00:15:31.875 --> 00:15:34.344
The Tylomon will chase
after me and then you can-

00:15:34.378 --> 00:15:35.512
[Tentomon] Don't talk crazy,

00:15:35.546 --> 00:15:38.081
I would never leave
a friend behind.

00:15:42.419 --> 00:15:43.420
No, Izzy!

00:15:47.391 --> 00:15:48.892
Gotcha!

00:15:48.926 --> 00:15:51.929
Izzy, there's something
I have to do...

00:15:54.398 --> 00:15:55.399
I am gonna-

00:15:59.570 --> 00:16:00.871
(Tentomon groans)

00:16:00.904 --> 00:16:01.905
Tentomon!

00:16:10.247 --> 00:16:12.416
[Tentomon] Izzy, listen...

00:16:14.084 --> 00:16:18.922
No matter what happens I will
always fight to protect you!

00:16:20.591 --> 00:16:21.592
Izzy!

00:16:24.294 --> 00:16:25.295
Tentomon!

00:16:29.633 --> 00:16:31.101
(rock music)

00:16:31.134 --> 00:16:34.104
[Tentomon] Tentomon
digivolve to...

00:16:40.978 --> 00:16:43.313
[Kabuterimon] Kabuterimon!

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:48.151
Not today!

00:16:49.453 --> 00:16:52.089
Not too shabby huh, Izzy?

00:16:52.122 --> 00:16:53.290
Kabuterimon.

00:16:54.491 --> 00:16:56.760
Tentomon, you digivolved!

00:16:56.793 --> 00:16:59.429
(singing in Japanese)

00:16:59.463 --> 00:17:01.765
[Kabuterimon] They picked
the wrong duo to mess with.

00:17:01.798 --> 00:17:06.603
what do you say we teach
those Tylomon what we can do?

00:17:06.637 --> 00:17:09.139
That's what I'm talkin' about!

00:17:13.176 --> 00:17:16.280
(lasers blasting)

00:17:16.313 --> 00:17:17.648
Pepper Breath!

00:17:19.149 --> 00:17:21.451
Biyomon digivolve to...

00:17:21.485 --> 00:17:23.487
[Birdramon] Birdramon!

00:17:24.688 --> 00:17:26.957
Is everyone holding
on tight down there?

00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:27.991
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

00:17:28.025 --> 00:17:30.861
Nice work, thank you, Birdramon!

00:17:38.168 --> 00:17:41.004
We're free, and now we
can join the fight, too!

00:17:41.038 --> 00:17:42.306
Right!

00:17:42.339 --> 00:17:46.877
-(lasers blasting)
-(Agumon roaring)

00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:06.396
[Agumon] Agumon digivolve to.

00:18:20.544 --> 00:18:21.545
Greymon!

00:18:24.881 --> 00:18:25.882
Nova Blast!

00:18:28.051 --> 00:18:31.054
(explosions booming)

00:18:38.228 --> 00:18:40.230
There's more of
them coming our way!

00:18:40.263 --> 00:18:41.565
They don't stop!

00:18:41.598 --> 00:18:43.200
Guess we gotta shake them off!

00:18:43.233 --> 00:18:44.234
You betcha

00:18:45.769 --> 00:18:48.238
(rock music)

00:18:50.107 --> 00:18:51.074
I knew it!

00:18:51.108 --> 00:18:52.376
Soundbirdmon's sound waves

00:18:52.409 --> 00:18:54.911
are controlling those
Tylomon to attack us.

00:18:54.945 --> 00:18:58.548
[Kabuterimon] Then the Tylomon
aren't our main concern.

00:18:58.582 --> 00:18:59.583
He is!

00:19:00.584 --> 00:19:04.421
(singing in Japanese)

00:19:10.927 --> 00:19:12.262
Electro Shocker!

00:19:21.972 --> 00:19:24.775
It worked, the Tylomon
are all retreating.

00:19:24.808 --> 00:19:27.811
[Kabuterimon]
That's how we do it!

00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:36.086
I guess we managed
to lose them somehow.

00:19:36.119 --> 00:19:38.622
It's all thanks to you,
Biyomon, nice flyin!

00:19:38.655 --> 00:19:40.123
Thanks!

00:19:40.157 --> 00:19:42.626
Yeah, that was spectacular!

00:19:47.998 --> 00:19:51.268
Well it's too bad we didn't
get to hear the entire story.

00:19:51.301 --> 00:19:53.103
(Digivice beeps)

00:19:53.136 --> 00:19:55.305
[Izzy] Hey, Tai can
you hear me, it's Izzy!

00:19:55.338 --> 00:19:56.606
Hey you're back!

00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:57.607
You okay?

00:19:57.641 --> 00:19:59.109
Yeah!

00:19:59.142 --> 00:20:01.278
We got ambushed earlier by
some brainwashed Tylomon,

00:20:01.311 --> 00:20:03.280
but Kabuterimon
took care of them!

00:20:03.313 --> 00:20:04.614
[Tai] Right on, Izzy!

00:20:04.648 --> 00:20:06.783
Wait Kabuteri-who now?

00:20:06.817 --> 00:20:08.618
[Izzy] I have something
amazing to tell you!

00:20:08.652 --> 00:20:10.654
Tentomon managed to digivolve.

00:20:10.687 --> 00:20:12.789
[Tai] No way, that's awesome!

00:20:12.823 --> 00:20:13.990
[Izzy] I know right!

00:20:14.024 --> 00:20:16.159
Oh and check this out!

00:20:16.193 --> 00:20:18.128
This Digimon was
able to manipulate

00:20:18.161 --> 00:20:20.163
a bunch of Tylomon
into attacking us.

00:20:20.197 --> 00:20:22.632
Be super careful if you see it.

00:20:22.666 --> 00:20:25.469
[Biyomon] Wait, that Digimon
was in our battle earlier

00:20:25.502 --> 00:20:27.003
making that horrible noise!

00:20:27.037 --> 00:20:29.139
[Kabuterimon] Soundbirdamon,
yeah, he's pretty annoying.

00:20:29.172 --> 00:20:30.340
[Tai] Got it!

00:20:30.373 --> 00:20:32.809
Thanks for the heads up, Izzy
and be careful out there.

00:20:32.843 --> 00:20:33.944
Roger!

00:20:33.977 --> 00:20:36.179
[Kabuterimon] Let's hurry
back to your friends now.

00:20:39.349 --> 00:20:40.984
I'm starting to
think that the reason

00:20:41.017 --> 00:20:45.021
I was sent here all alone, was
so I could finally meet you.

00:20:45.055 --> 00:20:46.189
[Kabuterimon] What's that?

00:20:46.223 --> 00:20:48.024
Sorry I couldn't hear you.

00:20:49.025 --> 00:20:50.694
I was just talking to myself.

00:20:50.727 --> 00:20:53.163
[Kabuterimon] Aww come
on don't be like that.

00:20:53.196 --> 00:20:55.499
You were saying something
about me weren't ya?

00:20:55.532 --> 00:20:57.667
[Izzy] I was just thinking
out loud, it's nothing!

00:20:57.701 --> 00:20:59.669
[Kabuterimon] You
sure? Last chance!

00:20:59.703 --> 00:21:00.670
[Izzy] I'm super sure!

00:21:00.704 --> 00:21:02.372
Now can we change the subject?

00:21:03.573 --> 00:21:06.576
(suspenseful music)

00:21:16.219 --> 00:21:18.021
Follow the Children.

00:21:18.054 --> 00:21:19.055
Now scram!

00:21:36.773 --> 00:21:41.745
[Valdurmon] We leave the rest
to you, the Digi-destined.

00:21:58.795 --> 00:22:01.264
I think something's coming.
