[Narrator] Guided by the
power of the eight crests,

00:01:42.806 --> 00:01:44.641
a new chapter of
the Digi-Destined's

00:01:44.675 --> 00:01:46.543
great adventure had begun.

00:01:47.311 --> 00:01:49.980
Who knows what trials
and tribulations

00:01:50.013 --> 00:01:50.981
they'll need to face

00:01:51.014 --> 00:01:53.984
in their fight against
the great catastrophe.

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.022
After braving a tough battle to

00:01:59.056 --> 00:02:01.191
restore a frozen hot Springs.

00:02:01.224 --> 00:02:05.462
Joe came out on top and became
the Lord of the Springs.

00:02:05.495 --> 00:02:08.865
It seemed like things
had finally thawed over.

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.835
(melancholy music)

00:02:13.737 --> 00:02:16.373
(wind howling)

00:02:17.674 --> 00:02:21.011
But why is the crew now
lost in an icy Tundra?

00:02:21.044 --> 00:02:23.747
Shivering through
Sub-Zero temperatures.

00:02:24.848 --> 00:02:26.550
[In unison] It's so chilly.

00:02:26.583 --> 00:02:28.151
How did we get here?

00:02:28.185 --> 00:02:30.754
(wind howling)

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.762
Are we there yet? I'm freezing!

00:02:39.896 --> 00:02:40.864
Oh my goodness,

00:02:40.897 --> 00:02:42.833
I'm gonna pass out!

00:02:42.866 --> 00:02:45.335
I'm afraid it's curtains for us.

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:47.104
This is where we meet our end.

00:02:48.271 --> 00:02:51.174

00:03:01.551 --> 00:03:02.586

(wheezing)

00:03:06.123 --> 00:03:07.224
The heavens,

00:03:08.291 --> 00:03:10.060
the heavens have forsaken,

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:14.231
they've forsaken me.

00:03:15.065 --> 00:03:16.033
Huh?

00:03:16.066 --> 00:03:19.569
(Blimpmon blades whirring)

00:03:22.572 --> 00:03:24.107
Wait a second.

00:03:24.141 --> 00:03:26.743
Is that Gomamon? And Joe?

00:03:26.777 --> 00:03:30.547
What're you all doing? You're
gonna catch colds out here!

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:31.581
[Group] Eh?

00:03:36.086 --> 00:03:37.054

Huh?

00:03:59.443 --> 00:04:00.811
What's that over there?

00:04:00.844 --> 00:04:03.413
Hey Chief, I can see
something in the distance.

00:04:03.447 --> 00:04:04.414
Straight ahead.

00:04:04.448 --> 00:04:06.083
Stop calling me Chief.

00:04:06.116 --> 00:04:07.918
For the last time, it's Captain!

00:04:07.951 --> 00:04:09.252
Whatever you say.

00:04:09.286 --> 00:04:10.454
What do we do, Boss?

00:04:10.487 --> 00:04:11.455
Honestly.

00:04:11.488 --> 00:04:14.257
I just said, "Call me Captain"!

00:04:14.291 --> 00:04:16.493
Now, look alive crew.

00:04:16.526 --> 00:04:18.628
We finally got ourselves a bite.

00:04:18.662 --> 00:04:20.464
So ya best not let it go!

00:04:20.497 --> 00:04:22.332

(Blimpmon's propellers whirring)

00:04:31.475 --> 00:04:32.943
[Mimi] What a coincidence!

00:04:32.976 --> 00:04:35.812
You caught us in the middle
of our Digimon School Trip.

00:04:35.846 --> 00:04:37.514
I was showing everyone
what it's like

00:04:37.547 --> 00:04:38.982
outside the Cloud Continent.

00:04:42.652 --> 00:04:45.155

00:04:49.993 --> 00:04:51.828
Nice and toasty.

00:04:51.862 --> 00:04:53.964
You're a real lifesaver, Mimi.

00:04:53.997 --> 00:04:55.198
Yo, not to interrupt,

00:04:55.232 --> 00:04:57.334
but why are we housing
these weirdos, anyway?

00:04:57.367 --> 00:04:59.970
They're looking pretty
sus, Mistress Mimimon

00:05:00.003 --> 00:05:01.304
[Joe and Gomamon] Wait, really?

00:05:01.338 --> 00:05:02.472
Why 'Mistress'?

00:05:02.506 --> 00:05:04.641
Uh, we've been through a lot.

00:05:04.674 --> 00:05:07.010
It's kind of a long story.

00:05:07.043 --> 00:05:08.545
What did you say, you ruffian?

00:05:08.578 --> 00:05:10.881
Did you just call us weird?

00:05:10.914 --> 00:05:13.049
[Kabukimon] Such an
undignified insult!

00:05:13.083 --> 00:05:14.718
You tryin' to scrap?

00:05:14.751 --> 00:05:16.486
Don't mind if we do!

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:17.554
[Kabukimon] Have at thee!

00:05:17.587 --> 00:05:18.989
Come on, make my day!

00:05:19.022 --> 00:05:22.058
(vines snap)

00:05:22.092 --> 00:05:23.059
Hah!

00:05:23.093 --> 00:05:25.829
Those who shout get kicked out!

00:05:25.862 --> 00:05:27.631
(surprised noises)

00:05:27.664 --> 00:05:29.733
So what have the two
of you been up to?

00:05:29.766 --> 00:05:31.902
You guys were getting
your soak on at those

00:05:31.935 --> 00:05:33.336
natural hot springs, right?

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:35.338
Yeah, about that...

00:05:35.372 --> 00:05:38.241
You could say that we've
got a long story of our own.

00:05:38.275 --> 00:05:40.777
[Shogun Gekomon] It's an
emergency, I tell you!

00:05:45.615 --> 00:05:50.620
(groaning)

00:05:51.288 --> 00:05:52.255
The spring dried up.

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:54.424
How does this keep on happening?

00:05:54.457 --> 00:05:56.426
I arrived for my morning spritz,

00:05:56.459 --> 00:05:58.361
but all the baths were gone!

00:05:58.395 --> 00:06:00.430
[Kabukimon] And this
time, it wasn't because of

00:06:00.463 --> 00:06:02.766
any meddling on our part.

00:06:02.799 --> 00:06:05.035
They were full the other day

00:06:05.068 --> 00:06:06.536
Without hot water,

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:07.637
I'll become an icicle!

00:06:11.441 --> 00:06:14.211
What'll we do without any water?

00:06:14.244 --> 00:06:16.413
[Kabukimon] According
to some ancient rumors,

00:06:16.446 --> 00:06:17.781
there may be hope for us if

00:06:17.814 --> 00:06:20.383
we venture to the
southern regions.

00:06:20.417 --> 00:06:22.953
A lush, bountiful land of riches

00:06:22.986 --> 00:06:24.454
bordered by a stretch of ocean,

00:06:24.487 --> 00:06:26.256
as warm as can be.

00:06:29.626 --> 00:06:32.629
I promised everyone that I
take them to a better place,

00:06:32.662 --> 00:06:34.631
to help them plant new roots.

00:06:36.099 --> 00:06:38.668
[Palmon] And that's how you
got stranded in the cold.

00:06:39.769 --> 00:06:40.804
Ah, achoo!

00:06:40.837 --> 00:06:42.239
(whimpers)

00:06:42.272 --> 00:06:44.975
Okay, I think we've
got the whole picture.

00:06:45.008 --> 00:06:46.142
So how about this?

00:06:46.176 --> 00:06:48.912
I'll chart a course with Blimpon
and we can take you there.

00:06:48.945 --> 00:06:50.046
Sound good to you?

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.315
(both gasp happily) We'd
love that, thank you, Mimi.

00:06:52.349 --> 00:06:53.316
Whoa!

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:54.985
-(gasping)
-(Blimpmon rumbling)

00:06:55.018 --> 00:06:58.588
(projectiles exploding)

00:06:58.622 --> 00:07:00.090
[Mimi] What's the commotion?

00:07:00.123 --> 00:07:01.591
[Bancho Mamemon]
We gettin' jumped?

00:07:01.625 --> 00:07:03.627
(gasps)

00:07:07.964 --> 00:07:09.432
[Joe] It's a ship!

00:07:09.466 --> 00:07:12.168
(ominious music)

00:07:26.683 --> 00:07:28.184
(Joe whimpers)

00:07:28.218 --> 00:07:29.452
Guess he likes gold, huh?

00:07:29.486 --> 00:07:31.187
I'm getting bad vibes.

00:07:31.221 --> 00:07:33.823
We're dealing with
one mean Digimon here.

00:07:33.857 --> 00:07:37.794
Ahoy! Which one of ye
scallywags is in charge?

00:07:37.827 --> 00:07:39.029
[Mimi] That would be me!

00:07:39.062 --> 00:07:40.630
I'm the one steering
this Blimpmon.

00:07:40.664 --> 00:07:43.199
Welcome! The name's Captain Joe!

00:07:43.233 --> 00:07:44.968
What the? What are you doing?

00:07:45.001 --> 00:07:47.337
I don't know, say
something already!

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:50.006
Hey Chief, is that a couple
of humans you're shaking down?

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:53.310
[Olegmon] It's
'Captain', you fool!

00:07:53.343 --> 00:07:56.212
Anyway, as ye can
see, we are pirates.

00:07:56.246 --> 00:07:58.148
And I am the leader
of this vessel,

00:07:58.181 --> 00:08:00.216
Captain Olegmon!

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:01.885
Pirate, Digimon?

00:08:01.918 --> 00:08:04.521
Uh-oh, I hope they're friendly

00:08:04.554 --> 00:08:05.889
[Bancho Mamemon] Olegmon.

00:08:05.922 --> 00:08:07.490
I've heard that name before.

00:08:07.524 --> 00:08:09.826
He's a Brawny buccaneer
that all the sea dwelling

00:08:09.859 --> 00:08:11.227
Digimon have been talking about.

00:08:11.261 --> 00:08:13.730
You're surprisingly
knowledgeable.

00:08:13.763 --> 00:08:15.865
Heh, I always stay in the know

00:08:15.899 --> 00:08:18.501
thanks to the ol'
Mamemon Network.

00:08:18.535 --> 00:08:20.737
Still, something's off.

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:23.740
What are seafaring and pirates
doing here on the river.

00:08:23.773 --> 00:08:25.875
That's enough talk,
ya landlubbers.

00:08:25.909 --> 00:08:28.044
Just hand over yer
vittles and yer vessel

00:08:28.078 --> 00:08:29.679
and nobody has to get hurt.

00:08:29.713 --> 00:08:31.414
[Mimi] Listen carefully, mateys.

00:08:31.448 --> 00:08:35.051
This ship's got its own
captain: Captain Joe!

00:08:35.085 --> 00:08:36.519
And as long as I'm here,

00:08:36.553 --> 00:08:38.588
I won't allow you to
touch this Blimpmon!

00:08:38.621 --> 00:08:41.257
Aw, man, will ya get a
load of this guy, Chief?

00:08:41.291 --> 00:08:42.759
[Olegmon] It's 'Captain'!

00:08:42.792 --> 00:08:44.361
(laughs)

00:08:44.394 --> 00:08:46.363
Ya sure squawk loud
for someone who barely

00:08:46.396 --> 00:08:48.398
comes up to me knee bone.

00:08:48.431 --> 00:08:49.866
Shake 'em down, me hearties.

00:08:49.899 --> 00:08:51.868
[Crew] Aye aye, sir!

00:08:51.901 --> 00:08:53.603
(cannons blasting)

00:08:53.636 --> 00:08:56.106
(Blimpmon passengers screaming)

00:08:56.139 --> 00:08:58.274
Hurry, let's fly away!

00:08:58.308 --> 00:09:00.110
(Blimpmon groaning)

00:09:00.143 --> 00:09:01.911
Ye won't get away!

00:09:01.945 --> 00:09:04.247
Doesn't this Blimpmon
have any cannons?

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:05.949
The good news is that they do.

00:09:05.982 --> 00:09:08.718
The bad news is that
they're out of ammo.

00:09:08.752 --> 00:09:10.053
[Mimi] No surprise there!

00:09:10.086 --> 00:09:12.722
Principal Babamon just
cheaped out on defense!

00:09:12.756 --> 00:09:16.559
If I had my bat with me, then
I'd show 'em a thing or two!

00:09:16.593 --> 00:09:18.561
Too bad it's busted
at the moment.

00:09:18.595 --> 00:09:21.598
(suspenseful music)

00:09:32.976 --> 00:09:33.943
Fly higher!

00:09:33.977 --> 00:09:35.478
We need to get to an altitude

00:09:35.512 --> 00:09:37.647
where their attacks
can't reach us anymore!

00:09:39.616 --> 00:09:42.819
(attacks bouncing off shield)

00:09:42.852 --> 00:09:45.021
(gasping)

00:09:46.189 --> 00:09:47.757
[Kabukimon] How
valiant, my lord.

00:09:47.791 --> 00:09:49.659
Good looking out there, weirdo.

00:09:49.692 --> 00:09:50.994
(cannon balls whooshing)

00:09:51.027 --> 00:09:54.998
Musical Fist!

00:09:55.031 --> 00:09:56.966
Now's our chance
to zoom outta here.

00:10:00.003 --> 00:10:01.638
(laughing)

00:10:01.671 --> 00:10:04.507
Whoa!

00:10:04.541 --> 00:10:06.876
(screaming)

00:10:07.877 --> 00:10:09.279
Oh, I can't hang on!

00:10:09.312 --> 00:10:11.014
My hands are too moist!

00:10:11.047 --> 00:10:12.015
[Kabukimon] My lord

00:10:12.048 --> 00:10:13.616
Shogon Gekomon!

00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:14.984
(cannons blasting)

00:10:15.018 --> 00:10:18.354
(passengers yelling)

00:10:18.388 --> 00:10:23.359
(all screaming)

00:10:25.161 --> 00:10:27.030
Uh-oh!

00:10:27.063 --> 00:10:28.031
(screaming)

00:10:28.064 --> 00:10:29.299
(thudding)

00:10:29.332 --> 00:10:31.901
(all screaming)

00:10:35.004 --> 00:10:36.539
[Kabukimon] My lord!

00:10:36.573 --> 00:10:38.308
Gomamon, no!

00:10:38.341 --> 00:10:39.375
Ah, no way!

00:10:40.577 --> 00:10:45.440
Joe!

00:10:52.864 --> 00:10:54.065
[Gomamon] Joe?

00:10:54.098 --> 00:10:55.400
Joe?

00:10:55.433 --> 00:10:56.534
Come on, buddy.

00:10:56.568 --> 00:10:57.569
Up at 'em.

00:10:59.771 --> 00:11:02.040
(groaning)

00:11:03.775 --> 00:11:04.876
Where are we?

00:11:04.909 --> 00:11:06.077
Is this jail?

00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:08.079
We're locked inside
the pirate ship.

00:11:08.112 --> 00:11:10.715
Looks like they scooped
us up when we fell

00:11:10.748 --> 00:11:12.550
and made us their prisoners.

00:11:15.753 --> 00:11:17.689
No worries, we get
captured all the time.

00:11:17.722 --> 00:11:19.357
It'll be fine.

00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:21.559
Say, where'd Shogun Geckomon go.

00:11:21.593 --> 00:11:24.696
Well uh, I'm not sure
where they're keeping 'em.

00:11:24.729 --> 00:11:26.564
Probably someplace larger.

00:11:26.598 --> 00:11:28.099
Hmm.

00:11:28.132 --> 00:11:29.300
All right then.

00:11:29.334 --> 00:11:32.437
I say we try getting out of
this one by ourselves for once.

00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:34.472
Okay, can you break this?

00:11:36.407 --> 00:11:38.109
Nasty!

00:11:38.142 --> 00:11:39.310
Is this their kitchen?

00:11:40.778 --> 00:11:42.780
[Gomamon] I think so,
but there's no food.

00:11:42.814 --> 00:11:44.115
Just dirty dishes.

00:11:44.148 --> 00:11:45.450
[Gwappamon] Hey!

00:11:45.483 --> 00:11:46.451
(both gasp)

00:11:46.484 --> 00:11:48.453
You two get back
here, right now!

00:11:48.486 --> 00:11:50.588
(scared yelling)

00:11:50.622 --> 00:11:52.790
(panting)

00:11:53.658 --> 00:11:55.393
(body thuds)

00:11:55.426 --> 00:11:56.394
[Joe] Uh?

00:11:56.427 --> 00:11:57.395
[Gomamon] Huh?

00:11:57.428 --> 00:11:58.463
(Gwappamon groans)

00:11:58.496 --> 00:12:00.298
Whoa, what'd you do to him?

00:12:00.331 --> 00:12:02.567
[Joe] Me? I didn't do anything.

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:04.235
Can't move.

00:12:04.269 --> 00:12:05.270
So hungry.

00:12:07.605 --> 00:12:08.673
[Both] Huh?

00:12:10.008 --> 00:12:11.609
What's this?

00:12:11.643 --> 00:12:14.479
Yer telling me the
smaller ones disappeared?

00:12:14.512 --> 00:12:17.282
We, uh, think they
might have escaped.

00:12:17.315 --> 00:12:18.816
Leave 'em be.

00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:21.419
Seems we're about to have
some company over anyway.

00:12:21.452 --> 00:12:25.490
(Blimpmon's propellers whirring)

00:12:25.523 --> 00:12:27.659
I'll jump on board and
keep 'em distracted.

00:12:27.692 --> 00:12:32.096
While that's happening, the
rest of us can sneak on in!

00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:33.464
Wait! No!

00:12:33.498 --> 00:12:34.499
Slow down!

00:12:34.532 --> 00:12:35.533
Full stop!

00:12:36.868 --> 00:12:38.469
(laughs)

00:12:38.503 --> 00:12:40.638
I'm glad yer making this easy.

00:12:40.672 --> 00:12:43.775
Now give us yer food and we'll
let the old frog walk free.

00:12:43.808 --> 00:12:45.843
You barbaric bully!

00:12:45.877 --> 00:12:47.345
Something's off here.

00:12:47.378 --> 00:12:48.446
[All] Huh?

00:12:48.479 --> 00:12:49.847
This is a desperate play.

00:12:49.881 --> 00:12:52.016
The Olegmon I heard of?

00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:53.952
He wasn't the type
of Digimon who'd use

00:12:53.985 --> 00:12:56.354
such dirty tricks in a fight.

00:12:56.387 --> 00:12:57.355
Listen, bro.

00:12:57.388 --> 00:12:58.456
It's over.

00:12:58.489 --> 00:12:59.624
We're all done for.

00:12:59.657 --> 00:13:01.526
Whoa. Back up a sec.

00:13:01.559 --> 00:13:03.161
Why are you done for?

00:13:03.194 --> 00:13:04.529
Because we're stranded.

00:13:04.562 --> 00:13:06.030
We have nowhere left to go.

00:13:08.066 --> 00:13:09.867
The sea back home turned black.

00:13:09.901 --> 00:13:11.336
The mountains became dust.

00:13:11.369 --> 00:13:13.671
All of our crops
suddenly disappeared.

00:13:13.705 --> 00:13:16.007
There was nothing we could do.

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:17.842
We were slowly starving.

00:13:18.676 --> 00:13:20.812
Our chief packed up
whatever crumbs we had left

00:13:20.845 --> 00:13:22.513
and set a course for the ocean.

00:13:22.547 --> 00:13:25.149
He made sure no one
got left behind.

00:13:25.183 --> 00:13:27.719
"I swear I'm gonna take
you to a better place

00:13:27.752 --> 00:13:29.721
where everybody will thrive."

00:13:29.754 --> 00:13:31.422
Well, that's what
he promised us.

00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:35.493
But the seas were as
still is a frozen pond.

00:13:35.526 --> 00:13:36.728
We tried to fish,

00:13:36.761 --> 00:13:39.564
but there was nothing
in the water to catch.

00:13:39.597 --> 00:13:40.732
Somewhere along the way,

00:13:40.765 --> 00:13:43.401
we ended up floating into
this river and finding you

00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:47.238
Quit dawdling!

00:13:47.271 --> 00:13:49.907
I want an answer in the
next 10 seconds, girlie!

00:13:49.941 --> 00:13:52.577
(Both growling)

00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:53.611
[Olegmon] Ten!

00:13:54.579 --> 00:13:56.014
Nine!

00:13:56.047 --> 00:13:57.348
-Hey,
-[Olegmon] Eight!

00:13:57.382 --> 00:13:58.583
Whenever you're ready.

00:13:58.616 --> 00:13:59.584
-Just say the word
-[Olegmon] Seven!

00:13:59.617 --> 00:14:00.752
and I'll throw down for you.

00:14:00.785 --> 00:14:02.086
[Olegmon] Six!

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:04.422
Thanks, Gomemon.

00:14:04.455 --> 00:14:06.024
Five!

00:14:06.057 --> 00:14:08.059
Four!

00:14:08.092 --> 00:14:09.093
Three!

00:14:10.061 --> 00:14:11.195
Two!

00:14:11.229 --> 00:14:12.196
(whimpers)

00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:13.264
One.

00:14:13.297 --> 00:14:15.033
[Joe] Not so fast!

00:14:15.066 --> 00:14:17.702
Huh?

00:14:17.735 --> 00:14:20.738
(tense music)

00:14:20.772 --> 00:14:21.773
It's Joe!

00:14:21.806 --> 00:14:23.041
Gomemon!

00:14:23.074 --> 00:14:24.042
Olegmon,

00:14:24.075 --> 00:14:26.444
I challenge you to a duel.

00:14:26.477 --> 00:14:29.380
Fair and square on
a captain's honor.

00:14:29.414 --> 00:14:32.950
So, you're prepared to
put your dignity at stake.

00:14:32.984 --> 00:14:35.253
Is that what you're
sayin' to me, boyo?

00:14:35.286 --> 00:14:37.555
Yeah. And if I end up winning,

00:14:37.588 --> 00:14:39.624
you let us go and
leave us alone.

00:14:39.657 --> 00:14:41.459
Oh ho ho, that's funny.

00:14:41.492 --> 00:14:43.895
If you lose, then you have
to surrender your grub

00:14:43.928 --> 00:14:46.798
and become our lackey for
the rest of your life.

00:14:46.831 --> 00:14:49.400
Sure, but you should
get ready to become mine

00:14:49.434 --> 00:14:51.269
after I wipe the floor with you.

00:14:51.302 --> 00:14:53.905
(laughs)

00:14:53.938 --> 00:14:56.107
You talk a real big game, bucko.

00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:58.443
We'll sink me ship
if we duke out here.

00:14:58.476 --> 00:15:01.412
How 'bout we move to the
top of that there iceberg.

00:15:01.446 --> 00:15:02.447
[Joe] Fine by me.

00:15:13.991 --> 00:15:16.494
You gonna be good
with two against one?

00:15:16.527 --> 00:15:19.931
You two runts barely add
up to one whole fighter.

00:15:19.964 --> 00:15:21.866
You worry 'bout yourselves.

00:15:25.703 --> 00:15:28.706
Gomamon, digivolve to

00:15:29.807 --> 00:15:31.676
Ikkakumon!

00:15:31.709 --> 00:15:33.811
That's cute, but
it won't do much.

00:15:33.845 --> 00:15:36.013
I'll let you land
the first blow.

00:15:36.047 --> 00:15:37.548
Harpoon Torpedo!

00:15:46.491 --> 00:15:47.492
Eh?

00:15:50.561 --> 00:15:51.796
Bullseye.

00:15:51.829 --> 00:15:54.232
(both groan)

00:15:55.666 --> 00:15:59.470
The two of you aren't
taking this serious, are ya?

00:15:59.504 --> 00:16:01.739
You can't fool this old sea dog.

00:16:02.673 --> 00:16:03.875
(grunts)

00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:08.346
Ikkakumon, digivolve to

00:16:10.915 --> 00:16:12.383
Zudomon!

00:16:12.416 --> 00:16:15.019
Okay then, get ready
for some real action!

00:16:17.588 --> 00:16:18.589
Oh ho!

00:16:21.058 --> 00:16:23.561
Thor Hammer!

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:34.405
Yer pullin' me leg if
that's all ye got laddy.

00:16:34.438 --> 00:16:36.607
(yelling)

00:16:45.883 --> 00:16:47.285
Vulcan's Hammer!

00:16:50.054 --> 00:16:53.624
(attack explodes)

00:16:59.297 --> 00:17:00.298
Ah!

00:17:07.939 --> 00:17:10.875
Why the snag? I coulda sworn
you was putting your honor

00:17:10.908 --> 00:17:16.122
as a captain on the line.

00:17:22.328 --> 00:17:25.565
(Zudomon groans)

00:17:25.598 --> 00:17:29.068
(both groaning)

00:17:29.101 --> 00:17:32.138
Don't you worry, I'm only
gonna take your food supply.

00:17:32.171 --> 00:17:34.307
Don't see no need
to go as far as

00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:36.642
takin' you or your
crew members' lives.

00:17:39.612 --> 00:17:41.480
I'm sorry for being a bilge rat

00:17:41.514 --> 00:17:43.816
and takin' you hostage earlier.

00:17:43.849 --> 00:17:44.850
I mean it.

00:17:46.619 --> 00:17:48.154
I know the truth.

00:17:48.187 --> 00:17:50.089
You only became a pirate

00:17:50.122 --> 00:17:52.658
to save your fellow
Digimon's lives.

00:17:52.692 --> 00:17:56.996
Eh, then you know
exactly why I can't lose.

00:17:57.029 --> 00:18:00.433
I have to do whatever it
takes for the sake of me crew.

00:18:00.466 --> 00:18:01.667
Me too.

00:18:01.701 --> 00:18:03.302
That's why we're the same.

00:18:04.637 --> 00:18:06.839
[Zudomon] Our
bonds keep us going

00:18:06.872 --> 00:18:08.774
so we can stay in the fight.

00:18:08.808 --> 00:18:10.509
Just look at Joe.

00:18:10.543 --> 00:18:11.978
Whenever anyone needs help

00:18:12.011 --> 00:18:15.181
he can unleash powers fiercer
than you could imagine.

00:18:15.214 --> 00:18:17.617
I've known that about
him from day one.

00:18:17.650 --> 00:18:20.653
That's just the kind
of friend he is!

00:18:21.988 --> 00:18:23.623
So long as I'm with Joe,

00:18:23.656 --> 00:18:27.326
I know I'll be able to tap
into even bigger powers too.

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:28.327
Right on.

00:18:28.361 --> 00:18:29.962
Let's make it happen!

00:18:29.996 --> 00:18:32.698
Zudomon, time to
go full throttle!

00:18:32.732 --> 00:18:35.735
(epic battle music)

00:18:37.003 --> 00:18:40.706
Zudomon, digivolve to

00:18:46.012 --> 00:18:48.214
Vikemon!

00:18:48.247 --> 00:18:49.482
(all gasp)

00:18:49.515 --> 00:18:51.517
That's a Mega Digimon!

00:18:59.058 --> 00:19:02.728
Ah ha ha! Finally,
a worthy opponent!

00:19:02.762 --> 00:19:03.763
Come 'ere!

00:19:07.566 --> 00:19:09.335
(Olegmon roaring)

00:19:09.368 --> 00:19:12.204
(Vikemon roaring)

00:19:14.874 --> 00:19:16.676
(weapons clang)

00:19:16.709 --> 00:19:19.211
(Vikemon growling)

00:19:19.245 --> 00:19:22.081
(Olegmon roaring)

00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:26.052
We will win this battle!

00:19:26.085 --> 00:19:28.721
Because we keep our promises!

00:19:28.754 --> 00:19:31.924
I'll save me crew,
no matter what!

00:19:34.126 --> 00:19:36.729
(axes shatter)

00:19:37.897 --> 00:19:40.099
(grunting)

00:19:40.132 --> 00:19:41.634
Arctic Blizzard!

00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:47.073
(Olegmon screaming)

00:19:53.245 --> 00:19:55.781
(ship's mast crashes)

00:19:55.815 --> 00:19:57.249
Let's go!

00:19:57.283 --> 00:19:58.284
Awesome!

00:20:00.419 --> 00:20:01.554
(crew clamoring in concern)

00:20:01.587 --> 00:20:02.922
[Divermon] No, Boss!

00:20:02.955 --> 00:20:05.658
Battle's over, me hearties.

00:20:06.659 --> 00:20:09.228
I'm afraid we've lost the fight.

00:20:09.261 --> 00:20:13.399
And with that, our long voyage
finally comes to an end.

00:20:13.432 --> 00:20:15.735
(thudding footsteps approach)

00:20:15.768 --> 00:20:17.236
Eh?

00:20:17.269 --> 00:20:19.972
Ah, ah! You can't nod off
when I haven't even given

00:20:20.005 --> 00:20:21.774
my first order yet, lackey.

00:20:21.807 --> 00:20:22.808
Huh?

00:20:26.679 --> 00:20:29.415
[Mimi] Why do we have to
chauffer the pirates again?

00:20:29.448 --> 00:20:31.150
[Bancho Mamemon] Because
they've exchanged blows.

00:20:31.183 --> 00:20:34.653
There's a bond you share
after you scrap with someone.

00:20:34.687 --> 00:20:35.988
[Palmon] Up ahead!

00:20:36.021 --> 00:20:38.491
[Joe] Yay! Land ho!

00:20:43.963 --> 00:20:45.164
With a place this nice,

00:20:45.197 --> 00:20:47.466
I don't think you'll have too
much trouble planting new roots.

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:48.934
A lad who keeps his word.

00:20:48.968 --> 00:20:51.270
You're the real
captain now, Joe.

00:20:51.303 --> 00:20:52.271
[Crew] Captain!

00:20:52.304 --> 00:20:53.973
(crew cheering)

00:20:54.006 --> 00:20:55.007
All hail our lord.

00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:56.342
Head honcho Bancho.

00:20:57.810 --> 00:20:58.844
Oh, I dunno.

00:20:58.878 --> 00:21:01.180
(Gomamon giggles)
How about 'Leader'?

00:21:01.213 --> 00:21:03.149
(Joe chuckles nervously)

00:21:03.182 --> 00:21:05.851
(crest dinging)

00:21:08.888 --> 00:21:11.157
(electronic beeping)

00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:12.958
Whoa, what is that?

00:21:12.992 --> 00:21:14.126
Another crest?

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:15.828
Guess you got one too.

00:21:17.196 --> 00:21:19.465
[Tai] Oh, you come here too?

00:21:19.498 --> 00:21:21.033
[Mimi] Is that Tai?

00:21:21.066 --> 00:21:22.268
[Palmon] And Agumon?

00:21:22.301 --> 00:21:23.969
[Joe] What are you
two doing here?

00:21:24.003 --> 00:21:25.371
We've been keeping
ourselves busy

00:21:25.404 --> 00:21:26.872
exploring around the continent.

00:21:26.906 --> 00:21:28.541
I bet you've seen some stuff.

00:21:28.574 --> 00:21:30.142
You have no idea.

00:21:30.176 --> 00:21:32.978
Yeah, it's actually
a really long story.

00:21:33.012 --> 00:21:34.814
[Gomamon] Got that
right, captain

00:21:34.847 --> 00:21:35.915
[Tai] Captain?

00:21:35.948 --> 00:21:38.350
[Joe] Yep. And don't you
forget it, you scallywag!

00:21:38.384 --> 00:21:39.819

[Izzy] The Digimon Encyclopedia!

00:22:43.549 --> 00:22:44.950
Vikemon:

00:22:44.984 --> 00:22:48.387
This stone-cold ice king
mega-digivolves from Zudomon.

00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:50.256
His special Arctic
Blizzard attack

00:22:50.289 --> 00:22:52.958
freezes everything around
him in an instant, brr!

00:22:52.992 --> 00:22:55.227
[Gomamon] Let's check out
some more facts about me.

00:22:55.261 --> 00:22:56.395
[Izzy] Gomamon?

00:22:56.428 --> 00:22:58.464
[Gomamon] That soft fur coat
with those fierce horns on

00:22:58.497 --> 00:23:00.566
my helmet make me
feel like royalty.

00:23:00.599 --> 00:23:03.636
I'm gonna have Joe wear the
same outfit so we can match!

00:23:03.669 --> 00:23:04.670
[Izzy] Lucky guy.

00:23:06.939 --> 00:23:09.341
Which Digman will
it be next time?

00:23:11.176 --> 00:23:13.312
[Narrator] Get
ready for a miracle.

00:23:13.345 --> 00:23:14.747
TK tries his very best

00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:18.083
to help El Dradiman
find their way home.

00:23:18.117 --> 00:23:20.786
[Tai] Next time: "A
Place to Return to."

00:23:20.819 --> 00:23:23.455
[Narrator] The adventure
continues in a new world.
