WEBVTT

00:00:11.576 --> 00:00:14.370
[Izzy] The Digimon Encyclopedia!

00:00:14.412 --> 00:00:15.496
Birdramon!

00:00:15.538 --> 00:00:17.540
This Digimon digivolves
from Biyomon.

00:00:17.582 --> 00:00:19.876
Meteor Wing is not only
its special attack,

00:00:19.917 --> 00:00:21.377
but it's super powerful,

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:23.755
pelting the enemy
with fiery feathers!

00:00:23.755 --> 00:00:24.922
Now check this out.

00:00:24.922 --> 00:00:26.507
The color of Birdramon's flames

00:00:26.549 --> 00:00:29.552
indicates that they're
around 1,500 degrees.

00:00:29.594 --> 00:00:31.721
But what's weird is that
Sora's always riding around

00:00:31.763 --> 00:00:33.556
on Birdramon
without any problem.

00:00:33.598 --> 00:00:36.100
Maybe she sits on a special
cushion or something?

00:00:38.102 --> 00:00:40.897
Which Digimon will
it be next time?

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:43.149

[Narrator] After making their
long and perilous journey,

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.493
the three Digidestined,
Tai, Izzy, and Mimi,

00:02:17.535 --> 00:02:18.744
returned to Tokyo.

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:21.205
Or so they thought...

00:02:22.999 --> 00:02:26.169
However, it turned
out to be a fake Tokyo

00:02:26.169 --> 00:02:29.755
that had been created
within the Digital World.

00:02:35.094 --> 00:02:38.222
Tai, I think we're still
in the Digital World.

00:02:38.264 --> 00:02:40.683
This is a city
created out of data!

00:02:40.725 --> 00:02:42.101
An artificial Tokyo!

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:49.108
Tai's team struggled in
their fight against Eyesmon.

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:52.403
But then, just in
the nick of time,

00:02:52.445 --> 00:02:55.239
the other team,
Matt, Sora, and Joe,

00:02:55.281 --> 00:02:57.033
arrived on the scene.

00:02:57.033 --> 00:02:59.911
Working together, they
defeated their enemy.

00:03:11.047 --> 00:03:14.425
But before they even had a
chance to catch their breath,

00:03:14.467 --> 00:03:16.052
a new Digimon appeared,

00:03:16.093 --> 00:03:18.721
rising from the ashes
of Eyesmon's defeat.

00:03:28.773 --> 00:03:32.068
(High-pitched Roaring)

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:42.119
[Tai] Don't tell me...

00:03:42.161 --> 00:03:43.913
You mean that
Eyesmon digivolved?!

00:03:43.913 --> 00:03:44.914
(Sora gasps)

00:03:44.914 --> 00:03:45.915
Look!

00:03:45.915 --> 00:03:47.250
Huh?!

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:48.793
(loud screeching)

00:03:48.834 --> 00:03:49.919
[Mimi] What?! No way!

00:03:49.961 --> 00:03:51.587
There are two of them now?!

00:03:51.587 --> 00:03:53.089
No, wait... even more!

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:56.968
Oh come on! No one told me
there would be math involved!

00:03:57.009 --> 00:04:00.096
[Joe] Whoa! How many
more are there gonna be?!

00:04:00.137 --> 00:04:02.348
No.. wait! That's...

00:04:06.185 --> 00:04:08.312
(Izzy gasps)

00:04:08.354 --> 00:04:10.273
Orochimon, an Ultimate Digimon!

00:04:10.314 --> 00:04:11.941
All eight of those heads

00:04:11.941 --> 00:04:14.652
actually belong to
just one Digimon!

00:04:14.694 --> 00:04:18.114
(Orochimon roars loudly)

00:04:19.282 --> 00:04:21.659
(scared screaming)

00:04:21.701 --> 00:04:23.452
What is this?!

00:04:23.452 --> 00:04:26.372
(glitching noises)

00:04:27.373 --> 00:04:28.374
Is this...

00:04:29.542 --> 00:04:30.543
an EMP?!

00:04:31.627 --> 00:04:33.796
E... M... What?

00:04:33.838 --> 00:04:35.673
Electromagnetic
pulse. A strong one.

00:04:35.715 --> 00:04:36.966
Huh?

00:04:36.966 --> 00:04:39.302
It's probably caused
by Orochimon's roar!

00:04:43.222 --> 00:04:44.181
(cars honking)

00:04:44.223 --> 00:04:47.643
(lightning crackling)

00:04:47.643 --> 00:04:48.978
(car alarm going off)

00:04:48.978 --> 00:04:51.647
(explosions)

00:04:51.647 --> 00:04:52.857
(Izzy gasps)

00:04:52.898 --> 00:04:55.818
No way! It's affecting
the real Tokyo too?

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:56.861
What?

00:04:58.988 --> 00:04:59.989
Huh?

00:05:01.324 --> 00:05:02.408
Giga Storm!

00:05:04.327 --> 00:05:05.828
Vulcan's Hammer!

00:05:08.581 --> 00:05:10.875
(grunting)

00:05:13.878 --> 00:05:16.714
(determined roar)

00:05:20.092 --> 00:05:22.845
(loud explosion)

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:27.850
[Tai] Agumon!

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:32.355
[Joe] Gomamon!

00:05:32.355 --> 00:05:33.356
Whoa!

00:05:34.357 --> 00:05:36.233
Everyone! We gotta
get outta here!

00:05:39.111 --> 00:05:41.072
(grunting)

00:05:41.113 --> 00:05:44.075
(worried gasps)

00:05:44.116 --> 00:05:45.910
Hurry! Get on!

00:05:45.951 --> 00:05:47.119
[Sora] Okay!

00:05:50.081 --> 00:05:51.582
(relieved sighs)

00:05:51.624 --> 00:05:53.793
[Sora] Tai! Matt! Hurry!

00:05:55.711 --> 00:05:58.130
[Tai] Matt, come
on! We gotta go now!

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:01.801
Ah!

00:06:04.261 --> 00:06:06.430
(relieved laughs)

00:06:06.472 --> 00:06:08.724
Garudamon! Let's
get out of here!

00:06:08.724 --> 00:06:11.644
(determined grunt)

00:06:13.145 --> 00:06:15.606
[Matt] Put me down.
We've gotta go back!

00:06:15.648 --> 00:06:18.067
We need to finish this
now, before it's too late!

00:06:18.067 --> 00:06:19.610
But, Matt!

00:06:19.652 --> 00:06:20.653
Huh?

00:06:23.072 --> 00:06:25.408
[MegaKabuterimon] I think
we're in the splash zone!

00:06:26.492 --> 00:06:28.411
Make that wind zone!

00:06:28.411 --> 00:06:30.079
[Garudamon] Everyone hold on!

00:06:30.121 --> 00:06:31.956
[Mimi] Hold on to
what?! We're falling!

00:06:31.997 --> 00:06:34.583
[Joe] Better us than
my grades am I right!

00:06:34.625 --> 00:06:37.294
(Joe screaming)

00:06:45.177 --> 00:06:48.305
(distressed yelling)

00:06:51.142 --> 00:06:53.102
[Tai's Mom] Wow, what a mess...

00:06:53.102 --> 00:06:54.311
What's the matter, mom?

00:06:54.353 --> 00:06:57.773
My GPS. It's been
acting really weird.

00:06:57.815 --> 00:06:59.150
(worried sigh)

00:06:59.191 --> 00:07:00.693
Huh?

00:07:07.324 --> 00:07:10.536
(exhausted sighing)

00:07:10.578 --> 00:07:12.204
Is everybody all right?

00:07:12.246 --> 00:07:13.956
Yeah, I think so...

00:07:13.998 --> 00:07:16.292
I thought that we were
done for back there!

00:07:18.002 --> 00:07:20.129
We can digivolve to
Ultimate too, but still...

00:07:20.171 --> 00:07:22.131
he's huge and super powerful!

00:07:22.173 --> 00:07:24.467
I'd even say super ridiculous!

00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:28.220
How is it fair to have
eight heads anyway?

00:07:28.262 --> 00:07:30.264
That's lot more heads
than anyone needs!

00:07:32.099 --> 00:07:33.726
How ya doin''' Gomamon?

00:07:33.767 --> 00:07:36.312
(struggling) I'm doing okay.

00:07:36.353 --> 00:07:39.482
But still, that was touch
and go for a minute there!

00:07:39.523 --> 00:07:42.318
Just when we thought we'd
managed to defeat Eyesmon,

00:07:42.359 --> 00:07:45.946
something even more powerful
appeared and shut us down!

00:07:45.988 --> 00:07:48.824
Well, for now, I think if
we just hide out down here-

00:07:48.866 --> 00:07:50.075
(Orochimon screeching outside)

00:07:50.117 --> 00:07:51.076
(Joe whimpers)

00:07:51.118 --> 00:07:53.829
Joe! Shh... It's okay!

00:07:53.871 --> 00:07:55.664
But Orochimon's out
there right now,

00:07:55.706 --> 00:07:58.250
looking everywhere for us
so he can take us down!

00:07:58.292 --> 00:07:59.293
(frightened) No way!

00:08:00.044 --> 00:08:01.670
I'm so scared

00:08:01.712 --> 00:08:04.423
Is this effecting Shibuya
in the real world?

00:08:04.465 --> 00:08:06.592
Could it be the two
different speeds of time

00:08:06.634 --> 00:08:07.593
are synchronizing?

00:08:07.635 --> 00:08:09.678
I'm sorry, what now?

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:12.181
Eyesmon was pulling in
massive amounts of data,

00:08:12.223 --> 00:08:14.892
bringing it from our world
over to the Digital World.

00:08:16.185 --> 00:08:18.020
That's what caused the
massive power outage

00:08:18.062 --> 00:08:20.272
In Tokyo and all the
chaos over there.

00:08:20.314 --> 00:08:23.776
And also generated the
fake Tokyo in this world.

00:08:23.817 --> 00:08:25.819
Despite being in
the Digital World,

00:08:25.861 --> 00:08:28.280
Eyesmon managed to create
a special dimension

00:08:28.322 --> 00:08:30.866
that linked directly
with our world.

00:08:30.908 --> 00:08:34.995
And then... it
digivolved to Orochimon!

00:08:35.037 --> 00:08:37.540
all these facts are
significant somehow...

00:08:37.581 --> 00:08:40.042
and I believe they're
all interconnected.

00:08:40.084 --> 00:08:42.711
If I can put together a theory
that incorporates it all,

00:08:42.753 --> 00:08:44.880
I might be able to
see the big picture.

00:08:44.922 --> 00:08:46.966
That's my Izzy! Always thinking!

00:08:47.007 --> 00:08:49.385
And always making me
dizzy with that thinking!

00:08:51.387 --> 00:08:54.265
I wonder if everything's okay
with Tai and his group...

00:08:59.937 --> 00:09:01.981
(static sounds)

00:09:02.022 --> 00:09:03.732
[Tai] (sighing) It's no use.

00:09:03.774 --> 00:09:06.694
Maybe this is 'cause of that
EMP thing Izzy mentioned.

00:09:07.861 --> 00:09:08.988
Huh?

00:09:09.029 --> 00:09:13.117
(strange noise
coming from outside)

00:09:17.037 --> 00:09:19.206
(hissing)

00:09:32.052 --> 00:09:34.847
(relieved sigh)

00:09:34.888 --> 00:09:36.473
So what happened earlier?

00:09:37.474 --> 00:09:39.226
It seems that Orochimon's power

00:09:39.268 --> 00:09:41.103
is directly affecting
our world too,

00:09:41.145 --> 00:09:42.521
and if that's true...

00:09:42.563 --> 00:09:44.565
we can't waste any
time in stopping him.

00:09:44.773 --> 00:09:46.900
Which means I need
to get back out there

00:09:46.942 --> 00:09:48.902
and take him down
as soon as possible.

00:09:49.903 --> 00:09:54.241
Right near Shibuya.
in Daikan-yama.

00:09:54.283 --> 00:09:57.703
That's where... my brother TK...

00:09:57.745 --> 00:09:58.829
is living right now.

00:10:00.164 --> 00:10:01.165
[Tai] What?

00:10:02.082 --> 00:10:05.252
(ominous music plays)

00:10:18.432 --> 00:10:20.976
(cars honking)

00:10:27.441 --> 00:10:28.442
[TK] Matt...

00:10:34.156 --> 00:10:37.451
Stuck smack in the middle
of Shibuya. Just great...

00:10:38.619 --> 00:10:39.578
(lightning crackling)

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:40.621
Huh?

00:10:40.663 --> 00:10:43.582
(car alarms going off)

00:10:43.624 --> 00:10:44.625
What is it now?

00:10:45.376 --> 00:10:47.961
(static sounds)

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:54.009
(scared gasp)

00:10:54.051 --> 00:10:55.552
(whimpering)

00:10:55.594 --> 00:10:57.012
[Man] The trains
are running again!

00:10:57.054 --> 00:10:58.013
Huh?

00:10:58.055 --> 00:10:59.181
What seriously?

00:10:59.223 --> 00:11:00.849
That's what the news said!

00:11:00.891 --> 00:11:03.268
[Other Man] Then let's go!
They could stop again soon!

00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:05.979
[Man] Yeah, okay. Standing
here isn't doing us any good.

00:11:06.021 --> 00:11:08.565
(static sound)

00:11:10.401 --> 00:11:12.027
Kari, we should go too.

00:11:12.069 --> 00:11:13.070
Huh?

00:11:13.112 --> 00:11:15.322
[Tai's Mom] Looks like
the trains will be faster.

00:11:15.364 --> 00:11:16.365
Mhm.

00:11:20.744 --> 00:11:23.288
[Woman] They said the
Inokashira Line's moving!

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:24.998
[Man] The subway seems okay now!

00:11:26.834 --> 00:11:27.793
[Woman] We gotta go!

00:11:27.835 --> 00:11:29.128
(concerned gasp)

00:11:29.169 --> 00:11:30.129
[Tai's Mom] Kari!

00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:32.631
(crowd arguing)

00:11:32.673 --> 00:11:36.218
Yeah, it's not only our
world that's at stake here.

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.638
Here in this world, there are
a lot of Digimon suffering.

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:43.142
All because of what some bad
Digimon have done to them.

00:11:43.183 --> 00:11:45.978
Hm...They aren't the only ones!

00:11:46.019 --> 00:11:47.730
A lot's happened to me here too.

00:11:48.439 --> 00:11:51.150
Aw, hey, come on Mimi! Cheer up!

00:11:51.191 --> 00:11:54.153
Oh, I'm just fine.
Thanks to you.

00:11:54.194 --> 00:11:57.906
(affirmative humming) I'm
proud of all you've done, Mimi.

00:11:57.948 --> 00:12:00.492
And, you know, I've
gone through a lot too!

00:12:00.534 --> 00:12:03.036
However! By confronting
and overcoming

00:12:03.078 --> 00:12:06.373
the obstacles that were in
my way, I've grown so much!

00:12:06.415 --> 00:12:09.585
I've become a much bigger
and better person now!

00:12:09.626 --> 00:12:11.253
Uh... I hope.

00:12:12.463 --> 00:12:15.090
And Gomamon, too! He
literally got bigger

00:12:15.132 --> 00:12:18.010
when he digivolved into that
incredibly strong Zudomon!

00:12:18.051 --> 00:12:19.678
(Gomamon giggles)

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:21.847
Hold on. If you
wanna talk bigger-

00:12:21.889 --> 00:12:24.224
I know what you're saying!
Garudamon would rival him!

00:12:24.266 --> 00:12:25.684
Mhm!

00:12:25.726 --> 00:12:28.270
You can keep bigger all you
want! I'm the prettiest!

00:12:28.312 --> 00:12:30.022
Well, yeah, but only
when you're Lillymon.

00:12:30.063 --> 00:12:31.774
Hey, what?!

00:12:31.815 --> 00:12:34.026
(Tentomon clears his throat)

00:12:34.067 --> 00:12:35.694
What about me?

00:12:35.736 --> 00:12:37.529
[Izzy] If coolness
is our metric,

00:12:37.571 --> 00:12:40.032
then the clear winner's
gotta be MegaKabuterimon!

00:12:40.073 --> 00:12:42.534
Oh really?! Aw shucks...

00:12:42.576 --> 00:12:43.869
-[Sora] Yup.
-Huh?

00:12:43.911 --> 00:12:46.038
[Sora] Even though we're
split up into two teams,

00:12:46.079 --> 00:12:48.040
we still made it here.

00:12:48.081 --> 00:12:49.792
I know if we all work together,

00:12:49.833 --> 00:12:51.502
we'll get through
this just fine!

00:12:53.337 --> 00:12:55.881
I know I wasn't the most
prepared at first, but...

00:12:55.923 --> 00:12:57.716
(Izzy hums in agreement)

00:12:57.758 --> 00:12:59.301
And I'll try my best too!

00:12:59.343 --> 00:13:00.552
Yeah me too!

00:13:00.594 --> 00:13:03.222
Me three! Let's do this!

00:13:03.263 --> 00:13:04.306
... Oh?

00:13:04.348 --> 00:13:08.018
(rumbling noise from above)

00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:12.731
Yeah, chances are
we can do this.

00:13:12.773 --> 00:13:14.608
Wait, I know we can do this!

00:13:16.193 --> 00:13:19.196
(determined grunts)

00:13:21.448 --> 00:13:25.327
(hopeful music playing)

00:13:25.369 --> 00:13:28.872
That guy's still
trying to hunt us down.

00:13:31.166 --> 00:13:33.168
Gabumon, you ready to go?

00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:34.169
You bet!

00:13:34.211 --> 00:13:35.170
[Tai] Wait.

00:13:35.212 --> 00:13:37.089
There's no point in
trying to stop us.

00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:39.508
I won't stop you. But
if you're gonna do this,

00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:40.717
we both oughta go.

00:13:43.011 --> 00:13:44.763
And we won't be alone.

00:13:44.805 --> 00:13:47.349
Agumon and Gabumon will
be there with us too.

00:13:47.391 --> 00:13:48.851
Uh huh! Let's do it!

00:13:48.892 --> 00:13:50.352
Yeah!

00:13:50.394 --> 00:13:52.437
You're way too eager about this.

00:13:52.479 --> 00:13:54.106
It's gonna be really
dangerous, you know.

00:13:54.147 --> 00:13:56.525
You say that like I haven't
been in dangerous situations

00:13:56.567 --> 00:13:58.861
dozens of times
since we got here.

00:13:58.902 --> 00:14:01.321
Don't get cocky. The
same goes for me.

00:14:01.363 --> 00:14:02.865
(Tai chuckles)

00:14:02.906 --> 00:14:03.866
(Matt chuckles)

00:14:03.907 --> 00:14:06.577
(humming in agreement)

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:20.048
(Orochimon roars loudly)

00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:21.592
(crowd gasps in confusion)

00:14:21.633 --> 00:14:23.385
[man] What was that?

00:14:23.427 --> 00:14:25.846
(static noise plays
over Orochimon's roar)

00:14:25.888 --> 00:14:26.889
Huh?

00:14:29.725 --> 00:14:31.727
We should keep on
traveling underground

00:14:31.768 --> 00:14:34.396
and then pop up right in
front of Orochimon's face.

00:14:34.438 --> 00:14:36.106
Even if he does have eight heads

00:14:36.148 --> 00:14:38.358
he still only has one body.

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:41.111
Which means we have just
one target to aim for!

00:14:41.153 --> 00:14:42.446
[Garurumon] We're close!

00:14:43.322 --> 00:14:45.115
Are you guys ready to do this?

00:14:45.157 --> 00:14:48.201
You bet! Alright,
let's go Agumon!

00:14:48.243 --> 00:14:49.244
Mhm!

00:14:51.246 --> 00:14:53.081
Agumon digivolve to...

00:14:54.166 --> 00:14:55.375
Greymon!

00:14:55.417 --> 00:14:59.087
(upbeat music playing)

00:14:59.129 --> 00:15:01.381
(screeching)

00:15:01.423 --> 00:15:02.966
Greymon!

00:15:03.008 --> 00:15:04.092
Nova Blast!

00:15:10.849 --> 00:15:12.559
(frustrated grunt)

00:15:12.601 --> 00:15:13.810
Garurumon, go!

00:15:13.852 --> 00:15:15.354
Howling Blaster!

00:15:16.271 --> 00:15:17.230
(explosions)

00:15:17.272 --> 00:15:18.273
Ah...

00:15:19.024 --> 00:15:20.317
Hey! Matt!

00:15:20.359 --> 00:15:21.360
Hm.

00:15:24.529 --> 00:15:25.822
Now, Garurumon!

00:15:31.453 --> 00:15:34.665
(heroic music playing)

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:40.796
Garurumon! digivolve to...

00:15:56.895 --> 00:15:58.063
WereGarurumon!

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:03.986
(loud roaring)

00:16:07.739 --> 00:16:08.740
Here I come!

00:16:12.411 --> 00:16:13.412
Wolf...

00:16:14.162 --> 00:16:15.163
Claw!

00:16:16.748 --> 00:16:20.002
(Orochimon screeching)

00:16:22.587 --> 00:16:24.840
All right... Go, Greymon!

00:16:29.928 --> 00:16:33.223
(heroic music playing)

00:16:36.393 --> 00:16:38.562
Greymon! digivolve to...

00:16:56.455 --> 00:16:57.539
MetalGreymon!

00:17:06.256 --> 00:17:08.925
(Both grunting)

00:17:12.554 --> 00:17:14.765
It's probably fighting
Tai and the others.

00:17:14.806 --> 00:17:18.685
(humming in agreement)

00:17:18.727 --> 00:17:21.438
[Tai] That head's the
one! Go MetalGreymon!

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:23.148
Yeah! Giga Storm!

00:17:28.737 --> 00:17:31.490
(loud explosion)

00:17:34.826 --> 00:17:35.911
Hm?

00:17:35.952 --> 00:17:36.953
Ah!

00:17:41.124 --> 00:17:42.209
[Tai] You good buddy?

00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:44.127
[MetalGreymon] All good.

00:17:44.169 --> 00:17:46.713
[Matt] How about
you, WereGarurumon?

00:17:46.755 --> 00:17:48.965
I can still... fight!

00:17:49.007 --> 00:17:50.509
[Garudamon] Count us in too!

00:17:51.635 --> 00:17:52.719
Huh?

00:17:52.761 --> 00:17:56.640
(up-lifting music playing)

00:17:56.681 --> 00:17:58.934
Hey! Is that the best you got?!

00:17:58.975 --> 00:18:00.393
[Garudamon] I'll take
care of that head!

00:18:00.435 --> 00:18:01.603
[MegaKabuterimon] Sounds good!

00:18:01.645 --> 00:18:03.605
And I'll take care of
those two knuckleheads!

00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:07.776
Now, if we all just work
together and combine our powers-

00:18:07.818 --> 00:18:10.278
Yes, exactly! Let's divide
up the rest of the heads

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:11.488
and take 'em down!

00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:12.781
You guys...

00:18:12.823 --> 00:18:15.033
[Mimi] Let's finish
this once and for all!

00:18:18.286 --> 00:18:20.997
(Zudomon grunts)

00:18:23.542 --> 00:18:27.170
(upbeat rock music playing)

00:18:27.212 --> 00:18:28.171
You guys! Go now!

00:18:28.213 --> 00:18:31.466
(humming in agreement)

00:18:35.387 --> 00:18:37.097
Let's go MetalGreymon!

00:18:37.139 --> 00:18:39.057
[MetalGreymon] Right!

00:18:42.185 --> 00:18:45.522
(MetalGreymon growling)

00:18:49.901 --> 00:18:51.236
Flower Cannon!

00:18:56.575 --> 00:18:59.536
(Garudamon battle cries)

00:18:59.578 --> 00:19:00.745
Horn Buster!

00:19:05.083 --> 00:19:07.669
(loud yelling)

00:19:16.344 --> 00:19:18.263
Just a little more...

00:19:20.515 --> 00:19:23.268
(surprised gasp)

00:19:25.854 --> 00:19:27.355
Is that... Matt?

00:19:36.948 --> 00:19:40.076
(MetalGreymon roaring)

00:19:40.118 --> 00:19:41.203
Giga Storm!

00:19:47.042 --> 00:19:50.253
(Orochimon screeching)

00:20:03.266 --> 00:20:04.226
Ah!

00:20:04.267 --> 00:20:05.769
Giga... Blaster!

00:20:17.614 --> 00:20:20.408
(pained screeching)

00:20:20.450 --> 00:20:21.451
Guys look!

00:20:22.661 --> 00:20:25.288
[Izzy] That dark-colored one
was Orochimon's real head.

00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:28.291
The rest were only decoys!
They were actually just limbs

00:20:28.333 --> 00:20:30.252
that were disguised
to look like heads!

00:20:41.012 --> 00:20:44.849
(light-hearted piano playing)

00:20:48.436 --> 00:20:50.146
So tired...

00:20:50.188 --> 00:20:51.398
(Sora chuckles)

00:20:51.439 --> 00:20:53.566
Yeah, everybody
worked really hard.

00:20:53.608 --> 00:20:54.734
(sighing)

00:20:54.776 --> 00:20:56.069
I did!

00:20:56.111 --> 00:20:57.112
Uh huh.

00:20:58.154 --> 00:21:00.740
[Tentomon] Man, who's
hungry? It's me.

00:21:00.782 --> 00:21:01.992
(Izzy laughs)

00:21:02.033 --> 00:21:03.743
I'm so glad that
everyone's safe now.

00:21:03.785 --> 00:21:06.079
All thanks to you, Gomamon.

00:21:06.121 --> 00:21:07.080
(Tai sighs happily)

00:21:07.122 --> 00:21:08.790
You really weren't
kidding when you said
