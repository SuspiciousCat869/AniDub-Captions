[Narrator] Guided by the
power of the eight crests,

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.869
a new chapter of
the Digi-Destined's

00:01:43.902 --> 00:01:46.672
great adventure had begun.

00:01:46.705 --> 00:01:49.208
Who knows what trials
and tribulations

00:01:49.241 --> 00:01:50.209
they'll need to face

00:01:50.242 --> 00:01:53.212
in their fight against
the Great Catastrophe?

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.181
Not long ago,

00:01:56.215 --> 00:02:00.085
Kari bonded with the friendly
gigantic Petaldramon.

00:02:00.118 --> 00:02:04.056
It was there she watched over
the Digmon's grand resurgence.

00:02:06.558 --> 00:02:09.194
She now finds herself
within the forest

00:02:09.228 --> 00:02:12.698
that bloomed from his
gargantuan remains.

00:02:12.731 --> 00:02:15.300
(gentle music)

00:02:17.803 --> 00:02:19.571
(all gasping)

00:02:19.605 --> 00:02:22.474
It's amazing how much it's
grown in such a short time.

00:02:23.442 --> 00:02:25.043
(Kari grunting)

00:02:25.077 --> 00:02:27.579
[Kari] It's good to be back.

00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:33.619
(eerie music)

00:02:35.587 --> 00:02:39.091
(Soulmon growling)

00:02:39.124 --> 00:02:42.160
(Komondomon barking)

00:02:43.295 --> 00:02:47.466
(Kari and Gatomon gasping)

00:02:47.499 --> 00:02:48.734
[Muchomon] Kari!

00:02:48.767 --> 00:02:50.068
Gatomon!

00:02:50.102 --> 00:02:51.570
[T.K. and Patamon] Huh?

00:02:51.603 --> 00:02:52.971
(Kari gasping)

00:02:53.005 --> 00:02:55.140
Hey, it's Muchomon and Puwamon!

00:02:55.173 --> 00:02:57.776
Hasn't the forest gotten
huge since you left?

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:58.810
Mm-hmm.

00:03:00.112 --> 00:03:02.481
[Muchomon] We wanna show
you something really neat.

00:03:02.514 --> 00:03:03.749
What is it?

00:03:03.782 --> 00:03:06.351
(gentle music)

00:03:08.987 --> 00:03:10.255
Pretty cool, huh?

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:12.791
(all gasping)

00:03:14.026 --> 00:03:16.094
(Digi-eggs clunking)

00:03:16.128 --> 00:03:18.697
(gentle music)

00:03:20.632 --> 00:03:22.267
So many Digi-eggs.

00:03:22.301 --> 00:03:23.268
What's a Digi-egg?

00:03:23.302 --> 00:03:24.836
They're like regular eggs,

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.172
except Digimon are
born from them.

00:03:27.205 --> 00:03:28.173
(Kari gasping)

00:03:28.206 --> 00:03:29.942
Like Patamon was!

00:03:29.975 --> 00:03:31.777
(Patamon giggling)

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.980
(gentle music)

00:03:35.013 --> 00:03:37.883
(Patamon giggling)

00:03:38.817 --> 00:03:40.686
And these are only
a few of them.

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:42.988
Digi-eggs are scattered
all over the forest!

00:03:45.824 --> 00:03:49.127
And that means the power
of the darkness is fading.

00:03:49.161 --> 00:03:52.197
And the Digital World's
system is returning to normal.

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.466
All these Digi-eggs
are proof of it.

00:03:54.499 --> 00:03:57.035
(Kari giggling)

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:59.538
This forest is a
symbol of our hope.

00:04:02.674 --> 00:04:04.209
[Muchomon] The Digi-eggs
rolled over here

00:04:04.242 --> 00:04:05.510
all on their own,

00:04:05.544 --> 00:04:08.180
because this area
gets so much sun.

00:04:08.213 --> 00:04:10.148
[Kari] They must
be full of energy.

00:04:10.182 --> 00:04:12.851
I wonder what kind of Digimon
will be born from them?

00:04:14.252 --> 00:04:16.855
(Kari gasping)

00:04:17.856 --> 00:04:20.258
Yeah, that one's struggling.

00:04:23.261 --> 00:04:24.663
It feels cold.

00:04:24.696 --> 00:04:26.398
(footsteps thudding)

00:04:26.431 --> 00:04:28.667
(leaves rustling)

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.502
(air whooshing)

00:04:30.535 --> 00:04:32.371
(Tai grunting)

00:04:32.404 --> 00:04:33.505
(Kari gasping)

00:04:33.538 --> 00:04:35.040
Oh, hey, Tai.

00:04:35.073 --> 00:04:36.208
What's up, Kari?

00:04:36.241 --> 00:04:37.576
Hi.

00:04:37.609 --> 00:04:38.577
Come here, you guys.

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.245
You've gotta check this out.

00:04:40.278 --> 00:04:41.847
(Gatomon gasping)

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:42.881
Wait.

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.053
There's something else here.

00:04:48.086 --> 00:04:50.589
(tense music)

00:04:52.891 --> 00:04:56.428
Hmm, maybe it'll get better
if we try to warm it up.

00:04:56.461 --> 00:04:57.529
(Muchomon and Gatomon moaning)

00:04:57.562 --> 00:04:58.930
(Tai yelling)

00:04:58.964 --> 00:05:01.900
(all laughing)

00:05:01.933 --> 00:05:03.368
We actually found that one

00:05:03.402 --> 00:05:05.937
during an expedition
deep inside the forest.

00:05:05.971 --> 00:05:06.972
Oh.

00:05:08.073 --> 00:05:10.075
Please guide me
there if you can.

00:05:11.243 --> 00:05:13.412
I'd like to see where
you found this one.

00:05:19.084 --> 00:05:21.453
It's pretty quiet this
deep in the forest.

00:05:21.486 --> 00:05:23.622
You sure this is
where you found it?

00:05:23.655 --> 00:05:25.557
A little further, but, yeah.

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.227
The last time we came here,
it was a whole lot warmer

00:05:29.261 --> 00:05:31.763
than the chilly weather
we're feeling right now.

00:05:33.498 --> 00:05:35.400
(gentle music)

00:05:35.434 --> 00:05:37.235
(Muchomon whimpering)

00:05:37.269 --> 00:05:38.770
I knew it.

00:05:38.804 --> 00:05:39.805
Soulmon.

00:05:43.108 --> 00:05:45.310
Those poor Digi-eggs.

00:05:45.343 --> 00:05:46.745
This stops now!

00:05:46.778 --> 00:05:48.280
Ready, Agumon?

00:05:48.313 --> 00:05:49.915
Pepper Breath!

00:05:49.948 --> 00:05:51.116
Boom Bubble!

00:05:53.685 --> 00:05:57.255
(Soulmon exploding)

00:05:57.289 --> 00:05:58.323
(Gatomon yelling)

00:05:58.356 --> 00:06:01.293
(Soulmon growling)

00:06:03.361 --> 00:06:04.696
Lightning Paw!

00:06:05.831 --> 00:06:09.468
(Soulmon shattering)

00:06:09.501 --> 00:06:13.305
[Soulmon 1] Oh, the
Celestial Digimon.

00:06:13.338 --> 00:06:14.673
[Soulmon 2] How wretched.

00:06:14.706 --> 00:06:16.608
[Soulmon 3] How wretched.

00:06:16.641 --> 00:06:18.477
[Soulmon 1] Curse them.

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:19.644
[Soulmon 2] Curse them.

00:06:19.678 --> 00:06:21.179
(all gasping)

00:06:21.213 --> 00:06:23.782
While this forest
fosters new life,

00:06:23.815 --> 00:06:27.185
it looks like it's become home
to some evil Digimon as well.

00:06:28.353 --> 00:06:29.788
(air whooshing)

00:06:29.821 --> 00:06:31.990
Soulmon are beings who
are filled with hatred

00:06:32.023 --> 00:06:35.894
for nearly any living thing
or life about to be born.

00:06:37.062 --> 00:06:39.331
What's gonna happen to
these Digi-eggs now?

00:06:39.364 --> 00:06:41.500
Will they still hatch?

00:06:41.533 --> 00:06:42.634
What?

00:06:42.667 --> 00:06:44.636
They'll be fine, right?

00:06:44.669 --> 00:06:46.138
Don't you worry.

00:06:46.171 --> 00:06:47.806
(Kari gasping)

00:06:47.839 --> 00:06:50.142
I'll make sure those
Digimon are born.

00:06:50.175 --> 00:06:51.576
I'll do whatever it takes.

00:06:54.679 --> 00:06:58.183
(whistle ringing)

00:06:58.216 --> 00:07:01.853
(Komondomon barking)

00:07:01.887 --> 00:07:04.356
(gentle music)

00:07:04.389 --> 00:07:06.057
Komondomon is going
to help us out

00:07:06.091 --> 00:07:09.361
by protecting all the
Digi-eggs in this area.

00:07:09.394 --> 00:07:12.230
You will all support
and guard Komondomon.

00:07:13.331 --> 00:07:15.000
Can't we do anything
more than that?

00:07:15.033 --> 00:07:16.835
And what about the Soulmon?

00:07:16.868 --> 00:07:18.236
We'll handle them.

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:20.005
Leave it to us.

00:07:20.038 --> 00:07:21.406
Right, Gatomon?

00:07:21.439 --> 00:07:22.908
Mm-hmm.

00:07:22.941 --> 00:07:23.942
Wow, Kari.

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:27.179
You know, if we all digivolve,

00:07:27.212 --> 00:07:29.347
then we can help you
stand up to them.

00:07:29.381 --> 00:07:32.884
Yeah, fighting probably
cannot be avoided.

00:07:32.918 --> 00:07:34.686
However, if we have to fight,

00:07:34.719 --> 00:07:37.055
we must do it without
hurting the forest.

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:41.593
(all gasping)

00:07:41.626 --> 00:07:43.061
If I'm correct,

00:07:43.094 --> 00:07:45.764
I should be able to detect
them with this Celestial Ring.

00:07:46.631 --> 00:07:49.201
Furthermore, I can
fight amongst the trees

00:07:49.234 --> 00:07:51.069
with this nimble body of mine.

00:07:51.102 --> 00:07:52.938
I'm perfect for the job.

00:07:52.971 --> 00:07:54.439
(Tai gasping)

00:07:54.472 --> 00:07:55.740
Please, Tai.

00:07:55.774 --> 00:07:57.209
But, Kari-

00:07:57.242 --> 00:07:58.476
We can do it.

00:08:03.248 --> 00:08:04.282
(Tai chuckling)

00:08:04.316 --> 00:08:05.317
If you say so.

00:08:07.452 --> 00:08:08.420
Go get 'em.

00:08:08.453 --> 00:08:09.921
I know you got this, Kari.

00:08:11.122 --> 00:08:14.292
-Thanks for believing in me.
-Hmm.

00:08:14.326 --> 00:08:16.995
(intense music)

00:08:18.997 --> 00:08:20.799
(Kari panting)

00:08:20.832 --> 00:08:21.833
That way.

00:08:22.634 --> 00:08:23.902
[Kari] On it!

00:08:23.935 --> 00:08:25.070
(Kari panting)

00:08:25.103 --> 00:08:27.939
Petaldramon, no
matter what it takes,

00:08:27.973 --> 00:08:29.808
we will protect your forest

00:08:29.841 --> 00:08:32.410
along with the
Digi-eggs inside it.

00:08:32.444 --> 00:08:34.579
(Kari panting)

00:08:34.613 --> 00:08:37.282
(intense music)

00:08:38.183 --> 00:08:40.318
(Tai grunting)

00:08:40.352 --> 00:08:42.921
You guys ready to start
gathering these Digi-eggs?

(footsteps pattering)

00:08:49.361 --> 00:08:50.495
They're up ahead!

00:08:50.528 --> 00:08:53.198
(intense music)

00:08:56.635 --> 00:08:58.503
(Soulmon growling)

00:08:58.536 --> 00:08:59.971
Lightning Kick!

00:09:01.873 --> 00:09:05.277
(Soulmon shattering)

00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:08.813
(Soulmon growling)

00:09:08.847 --> 00:09:11.683
Fine by me, I'll just
take you all on at once.

00:09:11.716 --> 00:09:15.320
(Soulmon growling)

00:09:15.353 --> 00:09:16.688
(Komondomon barking)

00:09:16.721 --> 00:09:19.357
[T.K.] Are you sure there are
more Digi-eggs in this area?

00:09:19.391 --> 00:09:20.625
-Huh?
-Huh?

00:09:20.659 --> 00:09:21.860
(T.K. and Patamon gasping)

00:09:21.893 --> 00:09:23.328
There's one over here!

00:09:24.396 --> 00:09:26.131
And two more over here.

00:09:26.164 --> 00:09:27.132
(Tai yelling)

00:09:27.165 --> 00:09:28.133

I got it!

00:09:29.668 --> 00:09:32.804
(Agumon crashing)

00:09:32.837 --> 00:09:34.539
No scrambled eggs today.

00:09:34.572 --> 00:09:37.842
(Soulmon growling)

00:09:37.876 --> 00:09:39.811
Lightning Paw coming at ya!

00:09:39.844 --> 00:09:42.914
(Soulmon shattering)

00:09:44.683 --> 00:09:47.585
(Soulmon growling)

00:09:48.553 --> 00:09:49.721
Careful, Kari!

00:09:51.189 --> 00:09:53.658
(Soulmon shattering)

00:09:53.692 --> 00:09:57.062

(Gatomon gasping)

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:12.911
Here we go.

00:10:12.944 --> 00:10:14.412
-Hmm.
-Hmm.

00:10:14.446 --> 00:10:16.681
(Soulmon growling)

00:10:21.561 --> 00:10:24.597
[Agumon] We sure gathered
a whole lotta Digi-eggs.

00:10:24.631 --> 00:10:27.934
I wonder how things are
going for Kari and Gatomon.

00:10:27.967 --> 00:10:28.968
Huh?

00:10:29.903 --> 00:10:31.371
What the...

00:10:31.404 --> 00:10:33.907
(tense music)

00:10:37.577 --> 00:10:39.045
(Kari and Gatomon whimpering)

00:10:39.079 --> 00:10:41.748
I've never seen so many
Soulmon in one place before.

00:10:43.249 --> 00:10:45.652
(tense music)

00:10:47.153 --> 00:10:48.121
What now?

00:10:48.154 --> 00:10:49.589
(Gatomon gasping)

00:10:49.622 --> 00:10:52.625
[Gatomon] The smell of
death is even stronger now.

00:10:52.659 --> 00:10:53.760
This must be...

00:10:55.962 --> 00:10:57.630
(laser beaming)

00:10:57.664 --> 00:11:00.633
Kari, get down!

00:11:00.667 --> 00:11:02.802
(trees disintegrating)

00:11:02.836 --> 00:11:04.738
It's gonna destroy
the whole forest.

00:11:04.771 --> 00:11:06.740
(Gatomon grunting)

00:11:06.773 --> 00:11:09.976
(tense music)

00:11:10.009 --> 00:11:12.112
This freezing air...

00:11:12.145 --> 00:11:13.813
(Kari gasping)

00:11:13.847 --> 00:11:17.317
That cursed fossil beast
driven by a fearsome rage

00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:19.619
can only be SkullBaluchimon.

00:11:22.956 --> 00:11:25.458
(tense music)

00:11:27.026 --> 00:11:29.462
[Soulmon] Destroy all life.

00:11:30.463 --> 00:11:31.831
Destroy all life.

00:11:33.867 --> 00:11:36.770
The forest will be
destroyed in no time.

00:11:36.803 --> 00:11:38.605
We have to fight.

00:11:38.638 --> 00:11:39.839
It's our only option.

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:45.011
(Kari and Gatomon grunting)

00:11:45.044 --> 00:11:47.981

(tense music)

00:11:49.215 --> 00:11:54.220
Let's do this!

00:11:54.988 --> 00:11:56.723
Gatomon digivolve to...

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:01.561
Angewomon!

00:12:07.066 --> 00:12:09.335
(Angewomon grunting)

00:12:09.369 --> 00:12:12.872
How dare you freeze the lives
of these innocent Digi-eggs?

00:12:12.906 --> 00:12:14.707
Your malice ends here.

00:12:14.741 --> 00:12:16.976
(SkullBaluchimon growling)

00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:19.312
Destroying Petaldramon's forest

00:12:19.345 --> 00:12:22.048
and putting all these
Digi-eggs in danger,

00:12:22.081 --> 00:12:23.516
I won't allow it!

00:12:24.684 --> 00:12:29.355
We shall protect
them at all costs!

00:12:30.857 --> 00:12:32.158
(Angewomon grunting)

00:12:32.192 --> 00:12:33.326

(Kari screaming)

00:12:51.377 --> 00:12:53.012
What's going on over there?

00:12:53.046 --> 00:12:54.013
Over that way.

00:12:54.047 --> 00:12:55.248
You see that?

00:12:55.281 --> 00:12:56.916
(tense music)

00:12:56.950 --> 00:12:59.018
He made it this far?

00:12:59.052 --> 00:13:00.753
Hope you're ready.

00:13:00.787 --> 00:13:03.356
(suspenseful music)

00:13:03.389 --> 00:13:05.225
[Angewomon] Kari, Kari!

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:09.095
I think I'm okay.

00:13:09.128 --> 00:13:10.363
[Angewomon] Thank goodness.

(suspenseful music)

00:13:45.498 --> 00:13:48.134
It's up to us to
save the forest.

(suspenseful music)

00:13:51.104 --> 00:13:54.140
I'll protect this
place with my life.

We gotta protect the
Digi-eggs, no matter what.

00:19:10.214 --> 00:19:11.215
Angewomon!

00:19:13.017 --> 00:19:15.553
(bright music)

00:19:34.038 --> 00:19:36.007
This must be...

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:37.041
Kari...

00:19:38.543 --> 00:19:41.112
(bright music)

00:19:48.085 --> 00:19:49.854
All living things...

00:19:49.887 --> 00:19:52.857
All life is protected
by the light,

00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:54.559
-and born anew.
-And born anew.

00:19:54.592 --> 00:19:56.193
[Kari And Angewomon]
Life illuminates.

00:19:56.227 --> 00:19:58.229
Illuminates not
only the present,

00:19:58.262 --> 00:20:00.765
it illuminates the future.

00:20:00.798 --> 00:20:02.934
That is why there is light.

00:20:02.967 --> 00:20:07.204
(SkullBaluchimon roaring)

00:20:07.238 --> 00:20:09.540
And light always protects life.

00:20:09.574 --> 00:20:11.075
I know it does.

00:20:11.108 --> 00:20:13.644
(bright music)

00:20:27.158 --> 00:20:30.962
Go now and rest in peace.

00:20:30.995 --> 00:20:33.598
(bright music)

00:20:45.276 --> 00:20:46.277
Soon,

00:20:48.779 --> 00:20:50.848
you will proceed to a new life.

00:20:52.016 --> 00:20:54.652
(gentle music)

00:20:58.456 --> 00:21:01.192

00:21:10.301 --> 00:21:13.170
(Kari giggling)

00:21:13.204 --> 00:21:14.505
[Tai] Hey!

00:21:14.538 --> 00:21:15.673
-Huh?
-Huh?

00:21:15.706 --> 00:21:17.942
[Tai] You okay over there, Kari?

00:21:17.975 --> 00:21:21.345
[Agumon] Yoohoo,
Kari! (giggling)

00:21:21.379 --> 00:21:22.380
We did it!

00:21:23.714 --> 00:21:26.450
(all laughing)

00:21:26.484 --> 00:21:29.553
(Nyokimon squeaking)

00:21:31.489 --> 00:21:33.024
We did it.

00:21:33.057 --> 00:21:36.160

forest, Petaldramon.

[Izzy] Next up on the
Digimon Encyclopedia is

00:22:43.127 --> 00:22:44.929
the Digi-eggs?

00:22:44.962 --> 00:22:47.665
Well, they're basically
eggs Digimon hatched from.

00:22:47.698 --> 00:22:49.366
Not only are they
born from them,

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:50.868
but it's said they
returned to an egg

00:22:50.901 --> 00:22:52.903
when their life comes to an end.

00:22:52.937 --> 00:22:54.438
Now here's a question for you.

00:22:54.472 --> 00:22:57.708
Which came first, the
Digi-egg or the Digimon?

00:22:57.742 --> 00:22:59.677
I meant to ask the
Digi-eggs' caretakers,

00:22:59.710 --> 00:23:01.045
but they were a little too busy

00:23:01.078 --> 00:23:03.948
looking after the
energetic Digi-eggs.

00:23:03.981 --> 00:23:06.550
(bright music)

00:23:06.584 --> 00:23:08.986
Which Digimon will
it be next time?

00:23:10.554 --> 00:23:12.223
[Narrator] Will Izzy
be able to solve

00:23:12.256 --> 00:23:15.793
the challenging riddles
Nanomon has in store for him?

00:23:15.826 --> 00:23:18.062
[Tai] Next time on
"Digimon Adventure:

00:23:18.095 --> 00:23:20.598
Bolt, HerculesKabuterimon."

00:23:20.631 --> 00:23:23.267

continues in a new world.
