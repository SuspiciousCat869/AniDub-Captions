[Narrator] This is the
mysterious world

00:01:42.264 --> 00:01:45.568
where Digimon live:
the digital world.

00:01:45.601 --> 00:01:48.004
Tai, Kari and the
other Digi-destined

00:01:48.037 --> 00:01:51.007
with their partner Digimon
continue their adventure

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.043
to stop the revival of the
legendary Millenniumon,

00:01:55.277 --> 00:01:56.746
all the while gathering

00:01:56.779 --> 00:01:59.215
the rest of their
friends along the way.

00:02:00.449 --> 00:02:03.853
The identity of the mysterious
enemy, AxeKnightmon,

00:02:03.886 --> 00:02:08.290
turned out to be Gatomon, the
remaining celestial Digimon.

00:02:10.726 --> 00:02:12.928
Kari and Gatomon were saved

00:02:12.962 --> 00:02:15.231
and rejoined with
Tai once again.

00:02:16.098 --> 00:02:18.300
However, AxeKnightmon...

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:23.539
(Gatomon meows)

00:02:23.572 --> 00:02:25.875
(Komondomon howls)

00:02:25.908 --> 00:02:29.945
Incredible. Gatomon's speaking
in Komondomon's language.

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:32.415
Let the others know
we're about to dive.

00:02:32.448 --> 00:02:34.717
Hey everybody,
we're about to dive.

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.552
Huh? What'd she say?

00:02:36.585 --> 00:02:39.955
Get ready. We're about to dive.

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.825
(Komondomon howls)

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:44.627

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.128
Wait, you mean now?

00:02:46.162 --> 00:02:47.129
(Agumon belches)

00:02:47.163 --> 00:02:48.731
I'm so full.

00:02:48.764 --> 00:02:50.900
(Komondomon laughs)

00:02:50.933 --> 00:02:55.938

(Komondomon gasps)

00:03:10.953 --> 00:03:12.588
Hang onto something tight.

00:03:12.621 --> 00:03:15.124

00:03:16.325 --> 00:03:17.793

00:03:17.827 --> 00:03:19.161
(T.K. and Patamon squeal)

(Tai screams)

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.610
(Komondomon barks)

00:03:34.643 --> 00:03:37.146
I wanted to try and
use this current

00:03:37.179 --> 00:03:39.815
in hopes of getting
closer to the fog.

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:41.117
The sealed grounds?

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.319
Sounds cool. What
kind of place is it?

00:03:43.352 --> 00:03:45.821
(sigh) I'll explain.

00:03:46.322 --> 00:03:50.192
A long time ago, deep within
this eternal continent of ours,

00:03:50.226 --> 00:03:51.460
(melancholy guitar music)

00:03:51.494 --> 00:03:53.496
near the very end
of the ancient war,

00:03:54.997 --> 00:03:58.400
Millenniumon's largest
shard landed in the fog,

00:04:02.171 --> 00:04:05.641
also known as the
sealed grounds.

00:04:05.674 --> 00:04:07.143
The remaining will
of Millenniumon

00:04:07.176 --> 00:04:08.844
that lingered from it

00:04:08.878 --> 00:04:13.215
sparked the greed of wicked
Digimon who sought power,

00:04:13.249 --> 00:04:15.751
which resulted in
new Digivolutions.

00:04:18.854 --> 00:04:23.492
So he caused that. But why?
What does he have to gain?

00:04:23.526 --> 00:04:25.661
The reason is quite
simple really.

00:04:25.694 --> 00:04:28.063
It's so that he can
create a new body

00:04:28.097 --> 00:04:30.432
and be born into this
world once again.

00:04:32.434 --> 00:04:34.537
Yes, and if not for you,

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.839
I was going to become
a part of that.

00:04:36.872 --> 00:04:41.877
Yeah but, you didn't and
know you're safe with us.

00:04:42.211 --> 00:04:45.014
Hmph, I suppose you have
Kari to thank for that.

00:04:45.047 --> 00:04:46.448
Huh?

00:04:49.051 --> 00:04:51.854
Which means Millenniumon is
still plotting to return.

00:04:51.887 --> 00:04:54.757
So we have to do everything
we can to reach the fog

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:56.692
before it's too late.

00:04:56.725 --> 00:04:59.562
Because defeating
Millenniumon is my duty

00:04:59.595 --> 00:05:01.463
as the celestial Digimon.

00:05:03.799 --> 00:05:04.800
-Right.
-Oh?

00:05:06.735 --> 00:05:08.904
Well, I gotta say very noble.

00:05:10.072 --> 00:05:11.073
Yeah.

00:05:12.942 --> 00:05:16.445
[Gatomon] Kari, I promise I'll
never put you in harm's way

00:05:16.478 --> 00:05:17.980
like that ever again.

00:05:19.481 --> 00:05:22.084

What in the world is
that noise? Where are we?

Don't panic, we
mean you no harm.

-All right, have it your way.

Gatomon, wait.

00:06:56.178 --> 00:06:57.212
[Sora] So fast.

00:06:57.246 --> 00:06:58.580
We gotta help.

Hi-ya.

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:16.265
[Kari] Gatomon...

(Manbomon gasp)

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:24.239
Hold on, look at the
ring on its tail.

00:07:24.273 --> 00:07:25.874
Just who are you?

00:07:31.046 --> 00:07:32.281
[Group] Whoa.

00:07:33.382 --> 00:07:34.750
Kari, what are you doing?

00:07:34.783 --> 00:07:37.219
It's far too dangerous
for you to be out here.

00:07:38.887 --> 00:07:41.090
What if don't ever
wanna leave your side?

00:07:43.959 --> 00:07:45.906
(Kari giggles)

00:07:50.653 --> 00:07:53.189
(sparkles chime)

00:07:53.222 --> 00:07:55.625
Please forgive us for that.

00:07:55.658 --> 00:07:58.995
We mistook you as assailants
which is why we attacked you.

00:07:59.028 --> 00:08:02.031
You have my sincerest apologies.

00:08:02.064 --> 00:08:05.201
(group gasps)

00:08:05.234 --> 00:08:06.702
There's no need.

00:08:06.736 --> 00:08:09.372
I hope you're able to forgive
us for our rude intrusion.

00:08:09.405 --> 00:08:10.706
Maybe this will help.

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:11.741
My name is-

00:08:12.575 --> 00:08:13.976
I already know.

00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:17.346
I can sense that you are
the celestial Digimon.

00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:20.049
Huh? You already know about us?

00:08:20.082 --> 00:08:22.318
As the one who governs
this underwater city,

00:08:22.351 --> 00:08:25.187
I could sense your
presence instantly.

00:08:25.221 --> 00:08:27.023
Hey, check out the necklace.

00:08:27.056 --> 00:08:29.392
It looks like the one on
Gatomon's tail, right?

00:08:29.425 --> 00:08:31.727
I can feel a great
power from it.

00:08:31.761 --> 00:08:33.562
Yes, my tail ring.

00:08:33.596 --> 00:08:36.499
It's only because of this
ring that I'm able to fight,

00:08:36.532 --> 00:08:38.367
even though I have a small body.

00:08:39.268 --> 00:08:40.569
I understand.

00:08:40.603 --> 00:08:43.005
My ring is the power source
that's able to sustain

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:45.074
this city's environment
under water.

00:08:46.609 --> 00:08:48.210
Hey Pataman, where's your ring?

00:08:48.244 --> 00:08:51.180
-Oh?
-(group chuckles)

00:08:51.213 --> 00:08:53.582
We are all on a journey
to reach the fog

00:08:53.616 --> 00:08:54.950
as soon as possible.

00:08:56.385 --> 00:08:57.520
So I was right.

00:08:57.553 --> 00:08:59.588
Millenniumon is
planning his return.

00:09:02.124 --> 00:09:05.061
I understand the
situation must be dire,

00:09:05.094 --> 00:09:07.563
but please, I implore
you to spend the night

00:09:07.596 --> 00:09:09.865
and rest here at my castle.

00:09:09.899 --> 00:09:11.701
(magical chime)

00:09:11.734 --> 00:09:15.604
-(gentle music)
-(Tai and Agumon laughing)

00:09:15.638 --> 00:09:17.073
It feels like we're flying.

00:09:18.407 --> 00:09:20.142
-(Kari giggles)
-Kari, please be careful.

00:09:21.644 --> 00:09:22.611
[Daipenmon] Around the time

00:09:22.645 --> 00:09:24.947
that the ancient war took place,

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:28.284
there were those who sought
out peace within the seas.

00:09:28.317 --> 00:09:30.119
We are their descendants.

00:09:30.152 --> 00:09:33.389
[T.K.] You mean you were
all originally land Digimon?

00:09:33.422 --> 00:09:35.991
They must've Digivolved
and adapted to the ocean.

00:09:40.496 --> 00:09:42.431
I see you made it here safely.

00:09:42.465 --> 00:09:44.734
(group gasps)

00:09:44.767 --> 00:09:45.968
Can we keep her?

00:09:46.001 --> 00:09:48.604
I'm Mareinangemon. I've
been expecting you.

00:09:48.637 --> 00:09:51.307
(playful music)

00:09:53.676 --> 00:09:56.912
(group munching)

00:09:56.946 --> 00:09:59.115
-Yum.
-You got that right.

00:09:59.148 --> 00:10:00.616
It's delicious.

00:10:06.856 --> 00:10:09.325
[Kari] I bet you're
tired Komondomon.

00:10:09.358 --> 00:10:11.827
It must've hurt when
you fell back there.

00:10:11.861 --> 00:10:14.864
(Komondomon groans)

00:10:15.965 --> 00:10:18.467
So this is where
you've been. Of course.

00:10:20.336 --> 00:10:23.806
Oh, Gatomon. I think
Komondomon's...

00:10:23.839 --> 00:10:26.142
I'll take care of him.

00:10:26.175 --> 00:10:28.844
-(magical chime)
-(Kari gasps)

00:10:28.878 --> 00:10:31.981
(Komondomon garbles)

00:10:33.382 --> 00:10:36.452
There. Komondomon will be
in tiptop shape by tomorrow.

00:10:36.485 --> 00:10:41.323
Thank you so much
Marineangemon. Rest easy now.

00:10:41.357 --> 00:10:43.292
(Komondomon howls)

00:10:43.325 --> 00:10:45.661
She really has
the kindest heart,

00:10:45.694 --> 00:10:47.863
so I have to protect
it at all costs.

00:10:49.665 --> 00:10:50.633
(digivice beeps)

00:10:50.666 --> 00:10:51.634
Tai, are you there?

00:10:51.667 --> 00:10:53.302
I have something to report.

00:10:53.335 --> 00:10:54.837
I'm here. What's going on?

00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:56.305
I have an update for you

00:10:56.338 --> 00:10:58.674
on the international
space station crisis.

00:11:00.075 --> 00:11:03.679
The remaining crew escaped and
are now all on board Soyuz.

00:11:03.712 --> 00:11:05.381
[Agumon] What's that
about soy sauce?

00:11:05.414 --> 00:11:07.716
I think it's a
Russian spacecraft.

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:09.718
[Agumon] A spice rack?

00:11:09.752 --> 00:11:12.321
This footage was
taken soon after.

00:11:12.354 --> 00:11:13.823
(mysterious music)

00:11:13.856 --> 00:11:16.392
It looks like restoring
the orbit wasn't possible.

00:11:16.425 --> 00:11:18.060
There are multiple
other satellites

00:11:18.093 --> 00:11:20.396
-in the collision path as well.
-(radar beeps)

00:11:20.429 --> 00:11:23.499
There's gotta be some
way to stop 'em, right?

00:11:23.532 --> 00:11:25.868
[Izzy] Not at the moment
but I'll keep you posted

00:11:25.901 --> 00:11:27.536
on any new information.

00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:29.071
Please do. Good luck.

00:11:30.439 --> 00:11:32.041
[Marineangemon] I see
there are disasters

00:11:32.074 --> 00:11:34.343
reaching the human
world as well.

00:11:34.376 --> 00:11:38.547
That's right, but we're
gonna find a way to stop 'em.

00:11:38.581 --> 00:11:41.417
That's why we're all
here: to put an end to it.

00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:43.085
[Group] Right.

00:11:43.118 --> 00:11:45.788
These children each have
the heart of a warrior.

00:11:46.956 --> 00:11:50.426
And so do I, because
I can't lose either.

00:11:53.896 --> 00:11:56.198
Hey, by the way, why were
those Digimon attacking

00:11:56.232 --> 00:11:57.433
the city earlier?

00:11:57.466 --> 00:11:59.768
Since we migrated
here from the surface,

00:11:59.802 --> 00:12:02.371
we're basically outsiders.

00:12:02.404 --> 00:12:05.274
As such, there is no
way to avoid collision

00:12:05.307 --> 00:12:07.543
with the original
sea dwellers here.

00:12:07.576 --> 00:12:10.613
So it's like an all
out turf war down here.

00:12:10.646 --> 00:12:11.881
Surf war.

00:12:11.914 --> 00:12:13.249
-(ominous music)
-But recently

00:12:13.282 --> 00:12:14.450
something has felt off

00:12:14.483 --> 00:12:16.886
about the sea
dwellers attacking.

00:12:16.919 --> 00:12:20.256
As if their intentions toward
us have now become deadly.

00:12:20.289 --> 00:12:21.590
That must mean...

00:12:21.624 --> 00:12:23.125
That the black
lightning is starting

00:12:23.158 --> 00:12:24.627
to reach even this far.

00:12:25.794 --> 00:12:28.764
Tomorrow, I shall move
this underwater city

00:12:28.797 --> 00:12:31.734
and return you and your friends
back to your sea current.

00:12:31.767 --> 00:12:32.968
(group gasps)

00:12:33.002 --> 00:12:34.770
[Patamon] You're gonna
move this whole city?

00:12:34.803 --> 00:12:36.238
[Marineangemon]
That's all we can do

00:12:36.272 --> 00:12:38.474
at the moment to avoid
further conflict.

00:12:38.507 --> 00:12:40.442
Thanks a lot, Marineangemon.

00:12:42.945 --> 00:12:46.315
(electricity zaps)

00:12:46.348 --> 00:12:49.184
(monster grumbles)

00:12:54.623 --> 00:12:57.159
(group snores)

00:13:02.698 --> 00:13:03.966
Aren't you gonna sleep?

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:07.503
I'm going to, once
you're asleep.

00:13:10.039 --> 00:13:11.106
(Gatomon gasps)

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:12.975
What are you doing?

00:13:13.008 --> 00:13:16.679
I'm just relaxing a little bit.

00:13:16.712 --> 00:13:19.014
Relaxing? I can't relax,

00:13:19.048 --> 00:13:22.451
not until I finally
defeat Milleniumon.

00:13:22.484 --> 00:13:26.188
But I'm just so comfy
with you in my arms.

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:33.003
Goodnight Kari.

00:13:37.733 --> 00:13:39.902
(fanfare)

00:13:41.303 --> 00:13:42.905
Now move forward.

00:13:44.573 --> 00:13:47.309
(Daipenmon whirs)

00:13:52.147 --> 00:13:54.049
(group gasps)

00:13:54.083 --> 00:13:56.719
All right, now we can get
back to the sea current.

00:13:56.752 --> 00:13:59.621
(Komondomon howls)

00:14:03.425 --> 00:14:05.894
(intense music)

00:14:05.928 --> 00:14:06.962
(group gasps)

00:14:06.996 --> 00:14:07.997
Of course.

00:14:09.331 --> 00:14:11.100
Who is that?

00:14:11.133 --> 00:14:13.669
It looks like Anomalocarimon.

00:14:15.104 --> 00:14:20.109
-(glass shatters)
-(Digimon gasp)

00:14:25.948 --> 00:14:29.585
(electricity zaps)

00:14:29.618 --> 00:14:31.653
Let's do this.

00:14:31.687 --> 00:14:33.422
(triumphant music)

00:14:33.455 --> 00:14:35.457
Agumon digivolve to...

00:14:37.459 --> 00:14:38.494
Go Biyomon.

00:14:40.529 --> 00:14:42.631
Biyomon digivolve to...

00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:46.635
It's our turn.

00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:53.308
-Pata digivolve to...
-(magical chime)

00:14:55.811 --> 00:14:56.812

Birdramon.

00:15:00.149 --> 00:15:01.216
Pegasusmon.

00:15:03.385 --> 00:15:04.620
What is it Kari?

00:15:04.653 --> 00:15:07.189
Let me help. I can fight too.

00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:10.526
No, you should
stay. It's not safe.

00:15:11.894 --> 00:15:14.530
Fighting is my job.
Leave it to me.

00:15:16.999 --> 00:15:19.701
(Gatomon grunts)

00:15:19.735 --> 00:15:20.903

(Gatomon yells)

00:16:20.562 --> 00:16:22.064
Gatomon, please.

00:16:23.899 --> 00:16:25.701
Please wake up.

00:16:25.734 --> 00:16:26.735
Huh?

00:16:40.983 --> 00:16:41.984
You ready?

00:16:44.153 --> 00:16:46.288
Greymon digivolve to...

00:16:59.334 --> 00:17:00.435
Metalgreymon.

00:17:03.272 --> 00:17:04.306
Giga blaster.

(explosion)

00:17:08.143 --> 00:17:09.478
Big brother.

00:17:10.779 --> 00:17:12.147
I wanna help.

00:17:12.181 --> 00:17:13.815
Please let me fight.

00:17:13.849 --> 00:17:15.350
Seriously? Hmph.

00:17:21.623 --> 00:17:24.793
(electricity zaps)

00:17:24.826 --> 00:17:26.528
I can't afford to back down now.

-(Birdramon grunts)
-(Pegasusmon grunts)

00:17:41.343 --> 00:17:42.344
Wait, Gatomon.

00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:46.315
Kari? But why?

00:17:47.683 --> 00:17:49.952
Go back, it's not safe here.

00:17:49.985 --> 00:17:51.787
I'm not gonna leave you.

00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:54.289
Stop trying to do
stuff all by yourself.

00:17:54.323 --> 00:17:58.460
-(Kari pants)
-(meloncholy music)

00:17:58.493 --> 00:17:59.494
Huh?

00:18:01.063 --> 00:18:02.064
Kari.

00:18:07.736 --> 00:18:09.471
I know in my heart,

00:18:09.504 --> 00:18:13.141
it was you who was
always calling out to me,

00:18:13.175 --> 00:18:16.044
ever since I can remember.

00:18:16.078 --> 00:18:19.848
You were there watching
over me, weren't you?

00:18:31.059 --> 00:18:32.160
I could feel it.

00:18:32.194 --> 00:18:34.429
You were out there Gatomon.

00:18:35.697 --> 00:18:38.834
Yes. I've been calling to you

00:18:38.867 --> 00:18:41.370
ever since I was
shrouded in darkness,

00:18:42.604 --> 00:18:46.541
(gasps) actually it
was long before that.

00:18:46.575 --> 00:18:49.711
I've always known
where I truly belong.

00:18:50.412 --> 00:18:51.947
I was waiting for you, Kari.

00:18:53.415 --> 00:18:56.885
Even though we were in
two different worlds,

00:18:56.918 --> 00:18:58.920
ever since I was a little kid,

00:18:58.954 --> 00:19:03.558
I knew deep down in my heart
we were connected somehow.

00:19:05.127 --> 00:19:07.362
Our encounter was beyond duty.

00:19:07.396 --> 00:19:11.033
It was fate, Kari, wasn't it?

00:19:11.066 --> 00:19:14.069
That's the reason I came
here, to the digital world.

00:19:14.102 --> 00:19:16.371
So that I could save you.

00:19:16.405 --> 00:19:18.974
Please, Gatomon, I
promise I can help.

00:19:20.242 --> 00:19:22.911
I don't wanna leave your
side, so let me fight.

00:19:24.646 --> 00:19:26.481
Very well Kari.

00:19:29.117 --> 00:19:30.786
Thank you Gatomon.

Is that a digivice?

00:19:54.142 --> 00:19:55.344
Are you ready?

00:19:59.815 --> 00:20:02.284
Since I am the
celestial Digimon,

00:20:02.384 --> 00:20:03.785
we're going to lead the warriors

00:20:03.819 --> 00:20:06.121
and repel darkness together.

00:20:07.489 --> 00:20:10.192
(heavenly music)

00:20:14.363 --> 00:20:15.330
Here we go.

00:20:15.364 --> 00:20:16.631
Go get them.

You're right.

00:21:12.087 --> 00:21:14.489
And from now on
we'll tackle anything

[Izzy] Next up on the Digimon
encyclopedia is Gatomon.

00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:47.115
This is Kari's partner Digimon.

00:22:47.148 --> 00:22:48.817
The ring on the tail is proof

00:22:48.850 --> 00:22:50.819
that it's a real
celestial Digimon.

00:22:52.687 --> 00:22:54.589
Check out this fun fact:

00:22:54.623 --> 00:22:57.092
according to my research,
most people find

00:22:57.125 --> 00:22:59.761
that cat punches are
usually soft and gentle,

00:22:59.794 --> 00:23:01.663
but if you ask me
there's nothing soft

00:23:01.696 --> 00:23:03.865
or gentle about
Gatomon's lightning paw.

00:23:06.968 --> 00:23:09.204
Which Digimon will
it be next time?

00:23:10.972 --> 00:23:13.108
[Woman] When Kari
lights Gatomon's heart

00:23:13.141 --> 00:23:16.778
with a ray of hope, a new
pair of wings takes flight

00:23:16.811 --> 00:23:18.146
in the skies.

00:23:18.179 --> 00:23:20.815
[Tai] Next time: The
Glowing Angewomon.

00:23:20.849 --> 00:23:23.818
[Woman] The adventure
continues in a new world.
