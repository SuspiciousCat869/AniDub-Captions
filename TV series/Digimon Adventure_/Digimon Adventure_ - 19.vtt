[Narrator] A crisis was
closing in on Tokyo.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.549
And to make things
worse, the Digimon

00:01:46.582 --> 00:01:48.417
known as Nidhoggmon appeared.

00:01:51.253 --> 00:01:55.224
Fortunately, that's when
Omnimon also made a reappearance

00:01:55.257 --> 00:01:57.560
and led the
Digi-destined to victory.

00:02:02.731 --> 00:02:05.367
However, Sora and the
others were swallowed up

00:02:05.401 --> 00:02:08.571
by a sudden storm and
vanished without a trace.

00:02:09.605 --> 00:02:12.274
(ominous music)

00:02:18.914 --> 00:02:21.784
[Devimon] Nidhoggmon,
that birth and death

00:02:21.817 --> 00:02:23.819
shall become a foundation.

00:02:25.154 --> 00:02:27.456
The path to reach
digivolution's end

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:30.593
will soon come within
reach of success.

00:02:33.262 --> 00:02:36.832
Let them ring, the voices
of the outer world.

00:02:39.635 --> 00:02:42.571
And now, that other
unexpected gift

00:02:42.605 --> 00:02:45.307
that was brought upon by chance.

00:02:45.341 --> 00:02:47.343
Bring it before me.

00:03:06.528 --> 00:03:07.496
Izzy, come in.

00:03:07.529 --> 00:03:08.497
Are you there?

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:09.832
Can you hear me?

00:03:09.865 --> 00:03:11.800
Sora, Mimi?

00:03:11.834 --> 00:03:12.935
Joe?

00:03:12.968 --> 00:03:15.104
If any of you can hear
me, please respond.

00:03:15.137 --> 00:03:16.605
Come in, guys.

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:18.274
Where are you?

00:03:18.307 --> 00:03:19.975
They just disappeared.

00:03:22.378 --> 00:03:23.846
(radio buzzing)

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:24.947
Yeah, I'm hearing you.

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:25.948
Who's there?

00:03:25.981 --> 00:03:26.949
Come in.

00:03:26.982 --> 00:03:27.983
Who is this?

00:03:29.018 --> 00:03:30.452
[Izzy] Hello, hello?

00:03:30.486 --> 00:03:32.021
Izzy here.

00:03:32.054 --> 00:03:33.622
Hey, it's Izzy.

00:03:33.656 --> 00:03:35.524
Izzy, it's me, Tai.

00:03:35.557 --> 00:03:36.525
[Izzy] Tai?

00:03:36.558 --> 00:03:38.127
Tai, it's Izzy.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.128
(Matt sighing)

00:03:39.161 --> 00:03:40.462
[Tai] (laughs) You're alive!

00:03:40.496 --> 00:03:41.697
And the others?

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.198
(Agumon sighing)

00:03:43.232 --> 00:03:46.302
[Izzy] Sora, Mimi, and Joe
are with me, they're okay.

00:03:46.335 --> 00:03:47.469
What about Matt?

00:03:47.503 --> 00:03:49.038
Matt's right here with me.

00:03:49.071 --> 00:03:51.473
And so are Agumon and Gabumon.

00:03:51.507 --> 00:03:54.009
So, where exactly are
you, anyway, Izzy?

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.846
Well, uh, that's the thing.

00:03:58.914 --> 00:04:03.686
-(siren blaring)
-(people chattering)

00:04:04.253 --> 00:04:05.254
We've come back.

00:04:08.924 --> 00:04:11.360
We're back at home,
in the real Tokyo.

00:04:16.098 --> 00:04:17.333
Huh?

00:04:17.366 --> 00:04:18.667
What did he say?

00:04:18.701 --> 00:04:20.402
(Agumon groaning)

00:04:20.436 --> 00:04:22.171
(Gabumon gasping)

00:04:22.204 --> 00:04:25.841
(gasps) Listen, Tai,
Tentomon, Biyomon, Palmon,

00:04:25.874 --> 00:04:28.210
and Gomamon are all missing.

00:04:28.243 --> 00:04:30.012
Are they there with you?

00:04:30.045 --> 00:04:31.714
[Tai] No, they're
not here either.

00:04:31.747 --> 00:04:32.715
(all sighing)

00:04:32.748 --> 00:04:33.749
No way.

00:04:36.218 --> 00:04:39.054
What in the world is going on?

00:04:39.088 --> 00:04:41.256
Anyhow, I'll look into it.

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.525
Right. Let me know
what you find, Izzy.

00:04:43.559 --> 00:04:45.461
[Izzy] But, Tai, what
about all of you?

00:04:46.462 --> 00:04:49.331
Yeah, well, it seems
pretty clear to me

00:04:49.365 --> 00:04:50.866
that we need to get a move on

00:04:50.899 --> 00:04:52.568
and find the Celestial Digimon.

00:04:52.601 --> 00:04:55.070
So then, we all just
keep following the route,

00:04:55.104 --> 00:04:56.605
like we did before.

00:04:56.638 --> 00:04:58.073
Straight ahead.

00:04:58.107 --> 00:04:59.108
[Izzy] Understood.

00:05:01.076 --> 00:05:03.779
[TV Host] And so the
mysterious countdown ended

00:05:03.812 --> 00:05:07.216
just as mysteriously as the
city's power was restored.

00:05:07.249 --> 00:05:10.452
However, the after-effects of
the prolonged power failure

00:05:10.486 --> 00:05:14.223
continue to be felt as well
as a sense of confusion.

00:05:14.256 --> 00:05:16.792
Seems like nobody's
noticed anything.

00:05:16.825 --> 00:05:20.596
So, do you think we've really
come back to our own world?

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:23.732
Uh-huh, it's not
a fake this time.

00:05:23.766 --> 00:05:24.933
This is real.

00:05:24.967 --> 00:05:26.802
We've come back
to our own world.

00:05:26.835 --> 00:05:28.637
(Joe sighing)

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:30.806
And where did you
run off to, Joe?

00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:32.574
To the police station.

00:05:32.608 --> 00:05:35.144
I told them how Tokyo
was in big trouble.

00:05:35.177 --> 00:05:37.079
I told them all about
it. Everything.

00:05:37.112 --> 00:05:40.115
Gave 'em a full report,
like a responsible citizen.

00:05:40.149 --> 00:05:41.417
[Both] Huh?

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:43.585
But I couldn't get 'em
to take me seriously.

00:05:43.619 --> 00:05:46.255
They told me I should just
go home and go to bed.

00:05:46.288 --> 00:05:48.157
It doesn't matter if
you tell them the truth,

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:49.591
they still won't believe you.

00:05:49.625 --> 00:05:50.626
Huh?

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:52.327
[Izzy] There's false
rumors and misinformation

00:05:52.361 --> 00:05:53.529
all over the internet.

00:05:54.663 --> 00:05:56.432
So what do we do, then?

00:05:56.465 --> 00:05:57.766
Clearly, we're
just going to have

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.668
to manage by ourselves for now.

00:05:59.701 --> 00:06:01.136
The first thing we have to do

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:03.138
is to find Tentomon
and the others.

00:06:04.473 --> 00:06:06.141
Huh?

00:06:06.175 --> 00:06:07.142
Hi, Kari.

Oh, uh, well, I was just...

00:06:18.353 --> 00:06:20.355
Quite a disaster, wasn't it?

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:21.957
All the power going out.

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:23.792
And all that traffic.

00:06:23.826 --> 00:06:25.828
Oh, hey, this is
actually perfect.

00:06:25.861 --> 00:06:27.596
You can watch Kari and the cat,

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:29.298
just while I go get my car.

00:06:29.331 --> 00:06:30.332
Thanks.

-(Sora groaning)

00:06:37.172 --> 00:06:38.841
Well then, let's get moving.

00:06:38.874 --> 00:06:41.043
We don't have much to
go on right now except

00:06:41.076 --> 00:06:42.845
for the direction
Ogremon showed us,

00:06:42.878 --> 00:06:44.213
but at least that's something.

00:06:44.246 --> 00:06:45.380
Yeah, you're right.

00:06:45.414 --> 00:06:46.682
Let's go, then.

00:06:46.715 --> 00:06:48.016
Yeah.

what we should do with them.

00:09:31.634 --> 00:09:32.635
Huh?

00:09:37.707 --> 00:09:38.975
Neemon, is he?

00:09:39.008 --> 00:09:41.010
They are all safe.

00:09:41.044 --> 00:09:43.580
They were taken in by our
troops and are being cared for

00:09:43.613 --> 00:09:45.215
at the refugee camp now.

00:09:46.316 --> 00:09:47.450
I see.

00:09:47.483 --> 00:09:50.520
These dire threats
and strange anomalies

00:09:50.553 --> 00:09:53.122
that are endangering
the Cloud Continent,

00:09:53.156 --> 00:09:55.358
there's a dark force
behind them all.

00:09:55.391 --> 00:09:58.194
One that lures evil to his side

00:09:58.228 --> 00:10:00.496
and gives that evil
even more power.

00:10:01.364 --> 00:10:04.133
This dark force has a name.

00:10:04.167 --> 00:10:05.168
Devimon.

00:10:06.336 --> 00:10:07.337
Devimon?

00:10:08.171 --> 00:10:10.807
I wonder if that's the same one?

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:13.509
(anxious music)

00:10:15.211 --> 00:10:16.679
Devimon.

00:10:16.713 --> 00:10:19.015
[Leomon] It's Devimon's
followers we're fighting.

00:10:20.183 --> 00:10:22.552
What about that big one
you and your guys attacked,

00:10:22.585 --> 00:10:23.553
what was that?

00:10:23.586 --> 00:10:25.021
Oh, that.

00:10:25.054 --> 00:10:26.723
It's called Bulbmon.

00:10:26.756 --> 00:10:29.826
The crowd leading the Large
Transporter Digimon you saw

00:10:29.859 --> 00:10:32.228
is also in contact with Devimon.

00:10:33.529 --> 00:10:36.065
(electrical buzzing)

00:10:36.099 --> 00:10:39.035
They were searching
this area for something,

00:10:39.068 --> 00:10:40.503
and they found it.

00:10:40.536 --> 00:10:43.039
We know this because our
scouts have been tracking them

00:10:43.072 --> 00:10:45.341
and tapping into
their communications.

00:10:45.375 --> 00:10:47.910
It's clear that whatever
it is that they found

00:10:49.078 --> 00:10:52.015
has something to do with
the Celestial Digimon.

00:10:52.048 --> 00:10:54.183
-Huh?
-The Celestial Digimon?

00:10:54.217 --> 00:10:56.019
(both gasping)

00:10:56.052 --> 00:10:58.254
We don't know exactly what it is

00:10:58.288 --> 00:11:01.557
but since Devimon wants
it, we have to find it.

00:11:02.625 --> 00:11:04.594
And that's exactly what
we were trying to do

00:11:04.627 --> 00:11:07.563
when we launched that surprise
attack against them just now.

00:11:07.597 --> 00:11:10.700
But then you had
to save us instead.

00:11:10.733 --> 00:11:12.402
Don't worry about that.

00:11:12.435 --> 00:11:13.903
We'll have another chance.

00:11:16.639 --> 00:11:17.640
-Leomon.
-Hmm?

00:11:18.741 --> 00:11:20.910
You have got to let
us come with you.

00:11:20.943 --> 00:11:22.879
If this cargo they're
carrying is related

00:11:22.912 --> 00:11:26.249
to the Celestial Digimon,
we have to go after it too.

00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:28.384
That's right.

00:11:28.418 --> 00:11:30.286
We've come all this
way because we have

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:32.455
to see the Celestial Digimon.

00:11:33.423 --> 00:11:34.924
There will be danger.

00:11:34.957 --> 00:11:36.726
Are you ready to face it?

00:11:36.759 --> 00:11:37.927
-Oh, you bet.
-Hmm-uh.

00:11:39.295 --> 00:11:40.630
Are we ready?

00:11:40.663 --> 00:11:42.732
We're never not ready.

00:11:42.765 --> 00:11:45.168
(heroic music)

00:11:49.505 --> 00:11:51.107
I understand.

00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:52.141
Very well.

00:11:57.180 --> 00:11:58.581
Let's ride.

00:11:58.614 --> 00:12:01.584
[Both] Right.

00:12:01.617 --> 00:12:04.287
(feet stomping)

00:12:13.732 --> 00:12:17.036
(air whooshing)

00:12:17.069 --> 00:12:20.096
(tense music)

00:12:20.096 --> 00:12:21.097
There it is.

00:12:21.931 --> 00:12:24.734
(metal clanging)

00:12:26.848 --> 00:12:28.282
All right, what's the plan?

00:12:28.316 --> 00:12:30.852
As soon as we break in
and make a commotion,

00:12:30.885 --> 00:12:34.122
most of them will go rushing
to protect their special cargo.

00:12:34.155 --> 00:12:36.290
They'll lead us right to it.

00:12:36.324 --> 00:12:37.525
Sounds like a plan.

00:12:37.558 --> 00:12:38.659
Here we go (growls).

00:12:40.695 --> 00:12:44.031
(Leomon grunting)

00:12:44.065 --> 00:12:46.901
(Leomon whooshing)

00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:00.415
It's go time.

00:13:04.419 --> 00:13:06.354
We should head toward
the lower decks.

00:13:07.422 --> 00:13:10.391
(laser guns whizzing)

00:13:10.425 --> 00:13:12.360
[Matt] Gabumon.

00:13:12.393 --> 00:13:15.029
(upbeat music)

00:13:29.777 --> 00:13:33.414
[Gabumon] Gabumon
digivolve to...

00:13:33.448 --> 00:13:36.050
(upbeat music)

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:48.429
[Garurumon] Garurumon.

00:13:48.463 --> 00:13:50.932
-Hop on, Agumon.
-Yeah.

00:13:50.965 --> 00:13:52.066
Ready?

00:13:52.099 --> 00:13:54.535
[Agumon] Here we go.

00:13:54.569 --> 00:13:56.437
(laser guns whizzing)

00:13:56.471 --> 00:13:58.372
[Agumon] Pepper Breath.

00:13:58.406 --> 00:14:00.908
[Garurumon] Howling Blaster.

00:14:07.248 --> 00:14:09.617
[Leomon] The Digi-destined.

00:14:11.886 --> 00:14:13.554
It has always been a name heard

00:14:13.588 --> 00:14:15.723
only in the ancient legends.

00:14:15.756 --> 00:14:17.425
To think there would come a day

00:14:17.458 --> 00:14:19.293
when I would actually meet them.

00:14:19.327 --> 00:14:23.464
A digivolve caused by the bond
between human and Digimon.

00:14:23.498 --> 00:14:26.567
Does this mean the destiny
of the Digital World

00:14:26.601 --> 00:14:29.136
is about to be drastically
changed forever?

00:14:30.338 --> 00:14:33.508
(laser guns whizzing)

00:14:34.642 --> 00:14:36.244
(Leomon grunting)

00:14:36.277 --> 00:14:37.311
(sword whooshing)

00:14:37.345 --> 00:14:39.080
I'll take the ones in back.

00:14:39.113 --> 00:14:41.482
[Garurumon] Sounds like a plan.

00:14:41.516 --> 00:14:44.619
(Garurumon growling)

00:14:46.821 --> 00:14:49.657
[Minotarumon] Leomon, huh?

00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:52.493
His target must be
our special cargo.

00:14:54.629 --> 00:14:56.422
In that case...

00:15:02.678 --> 00:15:05.348
(door whizzing)

00:15:06.349 --> 00:15:08.851
(Tai gasping)

00:15:11.621 --> 00:15:13.422
Just in time for the party.

00:15:13.456 --> 00:15:15.758
And it looks like we're
the guests of honor.

00:15:15.791 --> 00:15:16.792
No matter.

00:15:17.693 --> 00:15:19.462
(Leomon groaning)

00:15:19.495 --> 00:15:22.331
(sword whooshing)

00:15:23.966 --> 00:15:25.201
Almost too easy.

00:15:27.803 --> 00:15:30.273
This is only some
kind of storage.

00:15:30.306 --> 00:15:31.541
It's further down.

00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:37.146
(Tai grunting)

00:15:39.715 --> 00:15:41.851
[Minotarumon] I've
been waiting for you,

00:15:41.884 --> 00:15:44.654
Leomon, the sword wielder.

00:15:44.687 --> 00:15:46.122
(tense music)

00:15:46.155 --> 00:15:47.323
[Leomon] Minotarumon.

00:15:49.191 --> 00:15:52.828
So you're in command
of this transport unit?

00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:55.298
Digi-destined.

00:15:55.331 --> 00:15:56.799
[Both] Huh?

00:15:56.832 --> 00:15:58.868
The cargo we seek
is probably inside

00:15:58.901 --> 00:16:01.003
that container in
the center there.

00:16:02.371 --> 00:16:06.175
I'll keep Minotarumon busy,
that'll be your chance.

00:16:08.377 --> 00:16:09.845
(Tai gasping)

00:16:09.879 --> 00:16:13.549
Don't worry, Digi-destined, I
have a playmate for you too.

00:16:14.850 --> 00:16:18.554
-Bullmon.
-(tense music)

00:16:18.588 --> 00:16:21.691
(feet stomping)

00:16:21.724 --> 00:16:22.725
Agumon.

00:16:24.226 --> 00:16:26.762
(upbeat music)

00:16:40.242 --> 00:16:42.945
[Agumon] Agumon digivolve to...

00:16:56.726 --> 00:16:58.394
[Greymon] Greymon.

00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:07.470
(Greymon growling)

00:17:09.238 --> 00:17:12.875
(Greymon groaning)

00:17:12.908 --> 00:17:13.909
Huh?

00:17:19.081 --> 00:17:21.884
You fool, the fight
has already started.

00:17:21.917 --> 00:17:25.955
Well, in that case, I'll
just knock you out cold.

00:17:25.988 --> 00:17:28.658
(both grunting)

00:17:29.959 --> 00:17:31.794
I'll leave Bullmon to you.

00:17:31.827 --> 00:17:33.396
Right, we're on it.

00:17:33.429 --> 00:17:34.430
Let's go.

00:17:35.097 --> 00:17:37.800
(feet stomping)

00:17:37.833 --> 00:17:38.753
(Greymon groaning)

00:17:38.753 --> 00:17:40.554
[Matt] Go, Garurumon.

00:17:40.588 --> 00:17:43.591
(Garurumon roaring)

00:17:45.593 --> 00:17:48.029
[Leomon] Minotarumon, what
is it you hope to gain

00:17:48.062 --> 00:17:49.730
by turning to the dark side?

00:17:50.598 --> 00:17:52.700
(sword clanging)

00:17:52.733 --> 00:17:53.901
[Minotarumon] Power.

00:17:53.935 --> 00:17:56.904
The kind of power only
Devimon can create.

00:17:56.938 --> 00:18:00.041
It will change everything
about us Digimon.

00:18:00.074 --> 00:18:04.178
It will change the
entire Digital World.

00:18:04.211 --> 00:18:06.847
(Minotarumon growling)

00:18:06.881 --> 00:18:08.849
Earthquake Drill.

00:18:08.883 --> 00:18:11.752
(ground rumbling)

00:18:11.786 --> 00:18:15.222
(Leomon groaning)

00:18:15.256 --> 00:18:17.425
(sword clanging)

00:18:17.458 --> 00:18:20.761
(both grunting)

00:18:20.795 --> 00:18:21.796
Leomon.

00:18:23.464 --> 00:18:25.266
[Greymon] Tai, look out.

00:18:25.299 --> 00:18:26.534
Huh?

00:18:26.567 --> 00:18:28.869
Garurumon.

00:18:28.903 --> 00:18:30.604
(feet stomping)

00:18:30.638 --> 00:18:33.140
(Tai gasping)

00:18:35.743 --> 00:18:36.944
Watch out, Matt.

00:18:36.978 --> 00:18:39.246
Come get us, if you can.

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:41.916
(upbeat music)

00:18:50.458 --> 00:18:51.659
We're coming.

00:18:53.094 --> 00:18:56.931
(singing in Japanese)

00:19:15.783 --> 00:19:18.786
(ground rumbling)

00:19:18.819 --> 00:19:20.421
Greymon, let's do this.

00:19:20.454 --> 00:19:21.822
[Greymon] Okay.

00:19:21.856 --> 00:19:23.991
(Greymon roaring)

00:19:24.025 --> 00:19:26.527
(Tai yelling)

00:19:30.865 --> 00:19:32.800
[Greymon] Nova Blast.

00:19:41.208 --> 00:19:42.209
Yes.

00:19:43.477 --> 00:19:44.678
That's enough.

00:19:44.712 --> 00:19:46.881
It's time we ended
this fight as well.

00:19:48.049 --> 00:19:49.483
(sword clanging)

00:19:49.517 --> 00:19:52.820
Let's finish it
using fists alone.

00:19:55.356 --> 00:19:56.624
Fine.

00:19:56.657 --> 00:19:58.859
You think you can
beat my iron arm?

00:19:58.893 --> 00:20:02.063
Even with that fabled
Fist of the Beast King?

00:20:03.898 --> 00:20:05.866
(both grunting)

00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:07.334
Earthquake Drill.

00:20:08.836 --> 00:20:11.672
[Leomon] Fist of the Beast King.

00:20:15.342 --> 00:20:18.312
(Minotarumon groaning)

00:20:18.345 --> 00:20:22.683
[Minotarumon]
Earthquake (gasps).

00:20:24.585 --> 00:20:29.490
(growls) Fist of the Beast King.

00:20:29.523 --> 00:20:34.528
-(upbeat music)
-(Minotarumon groaning)

00:20:36.397 --> 00:20:37.565
(Minotarumon thudding)

00:20:37.598 --> 00:20:40.267
I have more than one fist.

00:20:43.404 --> 00:20:44.405
A new power.

00:20:46.107 --> 00:20:50.077
The era of a new kind of
digivolve is approaching.

00:20:50.111 --> 00:20:55.116
At your level, none of you
will survive what's coming.

00:21:01.188 --> 00:21:02.857
[Matt] So, do you
think this is related

00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:05.259
to the Celestial
Digimon, or what?

00:21:05.292 --> 00:21:06.393
We'll see.

00:21:06.427 --> 00:21:08.295

[Izzy] The Digimon Encyclopedia.

00:22:40.354 --> 00:22:41.522
Ikkakumon.

00:22:41.555 --> 00:22:43.958
This Digimon evolves
from Gomamon.

00:22:43.991 --> 00:22:47.294
The Harpoon Torpedo Attack's
horn can regenerate infinitely.

00:22:47.328 --> 00:22:49.663

00:22:51.498 --> 00:22:53.000
Ikkakumon can make his red claws

emit blisteringly
high heat at will.

00:22:55.336 --> 00:22:58.005
But I wonder, can the
temperature be adjusted?

00:22:58.038 --> 00:23:01.175
And if so, could I use them
to warm up my bento box?

00:23:02.576 --> 00:23:04.511
Which Digimon will
it be next time?

00:23:08.048 --> 00:23:11.485
[Narrator] Matt puts his
life on the line to save TK.
