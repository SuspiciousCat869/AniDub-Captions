[Narrator] Izzy and the
others have found themselves

00:01:41.488 --> 00:01:45.450
facing a tough challenge unlike
any they've faced before.

00:01:45.492 --> 00:01:49.496
They've run into a ruthless
enemy and its name is Argomon.

00:01:49.496 --> 00:01:52.123
In the meantime,
Tai's group was busy

00:01:52.165 --> 00:01:55.335
chasing after the Digi-Egg
of the Celestial Digimon,

00:01:55.335 --> 00:01:57.504
which was stolen
by SkullKnightmon.

00:01:58.672 --> 00:02:00.632
While fighting off
the ferocious attacks

00:02:00.674 --> 00:02:03.009
of the miasma beast Splashmon,

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:05.804
MetalGreymon's injured
arm became a new weapon

00:02:05.846 --> 00:02:08.849
and with it, they clawed
their way to victory.

00:02:12.018 --> 00:02:16.648
With the path finally clear,
TK swung the doors wide open.

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.859
Then Tai's group
bravely stepped foot

00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:20.861
inside the enemy's castle.

00:02:23.363 --> 00:02:25.991
Wow, this is a really
creepy place, huh?

00:02:26.032 --> 00:02:27.492
Feels like something
could jump out

00:02:27.534 --> 00:02:29.369
and attack us at any moment.

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:31.830
Let up, because as long
as I'm with you Tai,

00:02:31.872 --> 00:02:34.165
I know we've got
nothing to worry about!

00:02:34.207 --> 00:02:35.208
Yeah.

00:02:36.042 --> 00:02:37.836
You know, I've been thinking...

00:02:37.878 --> 00:02:39.713
The Celestial Digimon
was originally

00:02:39.713 --> 00:02:41.840
held captive in here, wasn't it?

00:02:41.882 --> 00:02:43.174
Not to mention Devimon brought

00:02:43.216 --> 00:02:45.051
the Digi-Egg back
to this place too.

00:02:45.886 --> 00:02:47.554
Just what are they trying to do?

00:02:49.556 --> 00:02:51.892
[Agumon] Uh, which way do
you think we should go?

00:02:52.726 --> 00:02:54.895
(TK sighs)

00:02:57.397 --> 00:02:58.690
It's this way!

00:02:58.732 --> 00:02:59.733
Hey, wait up!

00:03:11.578 --> 00:03:13.914
How do you know this is
where we're supposed to go?

00:03:13.914 --> 00:03:16.416
Because that's where the
voice is coming from.

00:03:17.584 --> 00:03:18.585
What voice?

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.880
Remember what happened in Tokyo?

00:03:21.922 --> 00:03:24.549
Back when all the power
failed? 'Cause I do.

00:03:24.591 --> 00:03:26.927
The trains kept running
and wouldn't stop.

00:03:27.928 --> 00:03:29.721
Ever since that happened,

00:03:29.763 --> 00:03:31.598
I've been hearing
this mysterious voice

00:03:31.598 --> 00:03:32.599
calling out to me.

00:03:33.934 --> 00:03:37.103
[Tai] Wait, TK, how'd
you even get here?

00:03:37.103 --> 00:03:39.898
To be honest, I'm
not really sure.

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.402
One night I was at home by
myself, they all of a sudden...

00:03:44.444 --> 00:03:47.572
I saw Matt and you
and everybody else.

00:03:47.614 --> 00:03:50.116
They were fighting
side-by-side with the Digimon.

00:03:51.284 --> 00:03:53.578
Everything got kinda
hazy so I don't remember

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.247
much after that, but
when I woke up...

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:58.583
I guess you opened your
eyes and there we were.

00:03:58.625 --> 00:04:00.961
So the Celestial Digimon
we've been looking for

00:04:00.961 --> 00:04:04.130
ended up having Matt's little
brother as their partner?

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:05.298
Didn't see that coming.

00:04:08.468 --> 00:04:09.803
(TK gasps)

00:04:09.803 --> 00:04:12.639
(ground explodes)

00:04:14.975 --> 00:04:16.810
[Gabumon] Chikurimon!

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:21.106
(punches land)

00:04:21.147 --> 00:04:22.315
Gabumon!

00:04:22.315 --> 00:04:24.943
I'm so glad I finally
get to meet you, TK!

00:04:24.985 --> 00:04:26.486
You're kind of a big deal.

00:04:27.654 --> 00:04:28.655
Gabumon...

00:04:29.322 --> 00:04:31.116
So until you get
to catch up again

00:04:31.157 --> 00:04:33.660
with the Celestial
Digimon, I'll protect you!

00:04:36.329 --> 00:04:38.790
They're moving in!

00:04:38.832 --> 00:04:40.500
-[Tai] Agumon
-[Agumon] On it.

00:04:41.835 --> 00:04:44.129
[Reporter] As of
approximately 12 PM today,

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:46.798
it appears that several tankers
in the Strait of Malacca

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.342
have fallen into a
mysterious and uncontrollable

00:04:49.342 --> 00:04:50.510
pattern of movement.

00:04:51.678 --> 00:04:53.638
If this situation
remains unchecked,

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.807
there is a likely possibility
that these vessels

00:04:55.849 --> 00:04:58.309
will collide into the
Port of Singapore.

00:04:58.351 --> 00:05:00.478
C'mon everyone, give
it all you've got!

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.815
At this rate, the ships are
gonna crash into the city!

00:05:03.857 --> 00:05:05.191
[Tentomon] We're
doing what we can,

00:05:05.191 --> 00:05:06.985
but these Argomon won't let up!

00:05:07.027 --> 00:05:10.030
I wish they'd learn
to take a hint!

00:05:11.531 --> 00:05:13.366
[Tentomon] Bug off!

00:05:15.201 --> 00:05:16.369
Super shocker!

00:05:19.205 --> 00:05:23.334
It'll be bad if the Algomon
digivolve, so Tentomon...

00:05:23.376 --> 00:05:24.669
[Tentomon] On it!

00:05:24.711 --> 00:05:27.547
-Ready, Biyomon?
-[Biyomon] Okay!

00:05:28.381 --> 00:05:31.384
Tentomon digivolve
to Kabuterimon!

00:05:34.054 --> 00:05:37.223
Biyomon digivolve to Birdramon!

00:05:38.725 --> 00:05:40.018
[Kabuterimon] Here we go!

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:41.019
[Birdramon] All right!

00:05:41.061 --> 00:05:42.520
[Kabuterimon] Electro Shocker!

00:05:42.562 --> 00:05:45.565
[Birdramon] Meteor Wing!

00:05:48.568 --> 00:05:49.694
[Gomamon] We'd better hurry up

00:05:49.736 --> 00:05:51.863
and do something
about that fast!

00:05:51.905 --> 00:05:53.239
[Palmon] Yeah, no kidding!

00:05:54.407 --> 00:05:56.743
[Sora] Even more ships
are getting taken over!

00:05:56.743 --> 00:06:00.080
I know, but we still can't
get an edge over the enemy!

00:06:27.107 --> 00:06:30.235
(wall explodes)

00:06:30.276 --> 00:06:32.445
Stop it, egg-napper!

00:06:32.445 --> 00:06:33.905
You see that, Tai?

00:06:33.947 --> 00:06:35.907
I think the stuff in that
hole is the same thing

00:06:35.949 --> 00:06:38.284
we found at the dark
swamp but even worse.

00:06:39.452 --> 00:06:41.621
[Tai] It's miasma,
a whole well of it.

00:06:41.621 --> 00:06:44.582
[Devimon] It is a shadowy
abyss of an altar,

00:06:44.624 --> 00:06:46.459
filled with infinite darkness.

00:06:48.461 --> 00:06:49.629
[Tai] Devimon.

00:06:49.671 --> 00:06:52.465
[Devimon] From this point
forward resistance is futile,

00:06:52.465 --> 00:06:54.467
Celestial Digimon.

00:06:54.467 --> 00:06:58.429
That innocent form shall
soon be steeped in despair

00:06:58.471 --> 00:07:01.307
and fall into eternal darkness.

00:07:01.307 --> 00:07:03.143
You can't, that's terrible!

00:07:03.143 --> 00:07:06.437
Turning the Celestial
Digimon into a Dark Digimon,

00:07:06.479 --> 00:07:08.314
so that was your plan all along.

00:07:09.149 --> 00:07:10.441
Wait, TK!

00:07:10.483 --> 00:07:12.277
[Devimon] Ah, the
one called upon

00:07:12.318 --> 00:07:14.946
by the Celestial Digimon.

00:07:14.988 --> 00:07:18.950
The required sacrifice
to complete our ceremony.

00:07:18.992 --> 00:07:23.288
This anguish will give birth
to an even deeper darkness.

00:07:23.329 --> 00:07:24.998
You shan't interfere.

00:07:30.503 --> 00:07:32.338
You shan't interfere.

00:07:34.507 --> 00:07:35.466
Agumon!

00:07:35.508 --> 00:07:36.676
Gabumon, now!

00:07:39.345 --> 00:07:42.182
[Agumon] Agumon, digivolve to...

00:07:47.687 --> 00:07:48.688
Greymon!

00:07:52.525 --> 00:07:55.528
[Gabumon] Gabumon,
digivolve to...

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:01.701
Garurumon!

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:06.372
(Mimi whimpers)

00:08:06.372 --> 00:08:08.333
What is taking so long?

00:08:08.374 --> 00:08:10.043
[Driver] Well as
you can see miss,

00:08:10.043 --> 00:08:12.545
we are currently stuck
in a traffic jam.

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:16.049
Try turning that way,
there's a shortcut.

00:08:16.049 --> 00:08:18.509
[Driver] Oh, if you say so.

00:08:18.551 --> 00:08:20.386
Now make a left at
the next corner!

00:08:20.386 --> 00:08:21.888
[Devimon] Of course.

00:08:21.888 --> 00:08:25.183
Goodness, you certainly
know your streets, milady.

00:08:25.225 --> 00:08:27.018
Ah, yes, that reminds me.

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:30.021
Your grandfather Master
Genichiro also knew his streets

00:08:30.063 --> 00:08:31.522
like the back of his hand.

00:08:31.564 --> 00:08:34.192
He was kind enough to show
me the many twists and turns

00:08:34.234 --> 00:08:36.903
of the city when I still
only a country bumpkin.

00:08:36.903 --> 00:08:38.404
[Mimi] That's great,
just hurry!

00:08:41.574 --> 00:08:42.742
This must be the place.

00:08:47.247 --> 00:08:49.207
Oh, don't worry about
me, ladies and gents.

00:08:49.249 --> 00:08:51.918
I can take the stairs, no
need to trouble yourselves!

00:08:54.254 --> 00:08:56.714
Right, the stairs! (pants)

00:08:56.756 --> 00:08:58.383
You hang in there, Gomamon!

00:08:58.424 --> 00:09:00.635
I'll be right over in a jiff!

00:09:06.182 --> 00:09:08.017
[Palmon] Poison ivy!

00:09:14.023 --> 00:09:15.692
There's tons of data
being transferred

00:09:15.692 --> 00:09:18.194
from the rendezvous point
to a specific location

00:09:19.362 --> 00:09:21.197
and unfortunately
that location...

00:09:21.197 --> 00:09:24.033
(suspenseful music begins)

00:09:24.033 --> 00:09:25.702
is the Digital World!

00:09:29.205 --> 00:09:30.999
Hold on, isn't that...

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:33.835
[Izzy] Exactly, it's like
how that fake Tokyo's Digimon

00:09:33.876 --> 00:09:37.213
digivolved using data
stolen from our world.

00:09:39.716 --> 00:09:42.010
I have an awful feeling
that something horrible

00:09:42.051 --> 00:09:43.886
like that is about
to happen again.

00:09:45.722 --> 00:09:48.558
(Garurumon shouts)

00:09:50.893 --> 00:09:53.563
(Greymon roars)

00:09:55.898 --> 00:09:58.901
(Garurumon shouts)

00:10:05.241 --> 00:10:07.368
(arrow explodes)

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:08.411
Oh no, Garurumon!

00:10:08.411 --> 00:10:10.872
Get up, Greymon!

00:10:10.913 --> 00:10:12.749
[Greymon] Nova Blast!

00:10:14.751 --> 00:10:17.587
(Greymon grunts)

00:10:20.923 --> 00:10:23.760
(Garurumon shouts)

00:10:30.099 --> 00:10:31.100
Garurumon!

00:10:31.309 --> 00:10:32.518
Greymon!

00:10:32.602 --> 00:10:34.062
He's too powerful.

00:10:34.103 --> 00:10:35.772
Maybe, but we can't
lose either way!

00:10:35.772 --> 00:10:38.566
We have to save the
Celestial Digimon,

00:10:38.608 --> 00:10:40.610
no matter what it takes.

00:10:43.279 --> 00:10:44.447
[Tai] Greymon!

00:10:44.447 --> 00:10:48.076
[Greymon] Greymon
digivolve to...

00:10:48.117 --> 00:10:49.118
MetalGreymon!

00:10:50.953 --> 00:10:54.123
[Garurumon] Garurumon
digivolve to...

00:10:55.792 --> 00:10:56.959
WereGarurumon!

00:11:00.129 --> 00:11:02.465
[MetalGreymon] Trident Arm!

00:11:03.966 --> 00:11:06.302
[WereGarurumon] Wolf Claw!

00:11:14.143 --> 00:11:17.647
(Tai, TK and Matt gasp)

00:11:17.647 --> 00:11:20.149
[SkullKnightmon] Devimon...

00:11:21.651 --> 00:11:23.486
[Devimon] Very well.

00:11:27.657 --> 00:11:30.159
[WereGarurumon] What the...?

00:11:31.494 --> 00:11:35.164
[SkullKnightmon]
Skullknightmon digivolve to...

00:11:45.174 --> 00:11:46.175
AxeKnightmon!

00:11:49.345 --> 00:11:50.513
(Tai, TK and Matt gasp)

00:11:50.513 --> 00:11:52.140
He digivolved too?

00:11:52.181 --> 00:11:53.683
[Tai] Into AxeKnightmon!

00:12:13.536 --> 00:12:14.537
TK, no!

00:12:16.539 --> 00:12:18.207
[TK] Weregarurumon...

00:12:18.207 --> 00:12:19.709
[WereGarurumon] I
told you, didn't I?

00:12:19.709 --> 00:12:21.711
I've got your back, TK!

00:12:21.711 --> 00:12:23.337
Take him down, Metalgreymon!

00:12:23.379 --> 00:12:28.384
[MetalGreymon] Giga Storm!

00:12:32.722 --> 00:12:37.727
Trident Arm!

00:12:38.394 --> 00:12:41.230
(MetalGreymon groans)

00:12:50.573 --> 00:12:51.866
(bullets blast)

00:12:51.908 --> 00:12:54.911
(MetalGreymon gasps)

00:13:01.083 --> 00:13:03.419
(TK coughs)

00:13:07.256 --> 00:13:08.549
(TK gasps)

00:13:08.591 --> 00:13:10.593
[TK] Move it, you big bully!

00:13:12.929 --> 00:13:14.222
[AxeKnightmon] Don't fight it.

00:13:14.263 --> 00:13:18.559
The Celestial Digimon
will fall into darkness.

00:13:18.601 --> 00:13:19.727
No, it wont!

00:13:19.769 --> 00:13:22.063
I promise I'm gonna save it

00:13:22.104 --> 00:13:26.901
because The Celestial Digimon
is calling me, you got that?

00:13:26.943 --> 00:13:27.944
TK...

00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:34.242
[AxeKnightmon] The light will
surrender to the darkness

00:13:34.283 --> 00:13:37.787
and all hope will soon
be steeped in despair.

00:13:38.955 --> 00:13:40.581
You won't ever get to do that!

00:13:40.623 --> 00:13:41.958
I won't give up!

00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:44.627
I'm gonna fight 'till the end!

00:13:55.137 --> 00:13:57.473
(TK grunts)

00:13:57.473 --> 00:14:00.142
(suspenseful music begins)

00:14:00.142 --> 00:14:02.645
(TK exclaims)

00:14:09.652 --> 00:14:12.280
[Sora] Those tankers are
gonna crash any second!

00:14:12.321 --> 00:14:13.447
It looks like we're almost

00:14:13.489 --> 00:14:14.657
-out of time.
-[Joe] Hey!

00:14:15.324 --> 00:14:16.784
Glad to see you made it.

00:14:16.826 --> 00:14:19.161
Sorry about the wait, guys.

00:14:19.161 --> 00:14:20.329
[Izzy] Mimi!

00:14:20.329 --> 00:14:23.291
[Joe] Gomamon, I'm
sorry I took so long!

00:14:23.332 --> 00:14:24.500
Joe!

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:26.002
[Mimi] Palmon, I'm here!

00:14:26.002 --> 00:14:26.877
(Palmon gasps)

00:14:31.173 --> 00:14:32.967
[Palmon] Mimi, I'm
so glad you came!

00:14:33.009 --> 00:14:35.803
[Gomamon] Been
waitin' for you, Joe!

00:14:35.845 --> 00:14:37.471
[Palmon] Palmon digivolve to...

00:14:37.513 --> 00:14:39.807
[Gomamon] Gomamon
digivolve to...

00:14:39.849 --> 00:14:40.808
[Togemon] Togemon!

00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:42.643
[Ikkakumon] Ikkakumon!

00:14:42.685 --> 00:14:45.646
(all shout)

00:14:45.688 --> 00:14:48.524
(attacks land)

00:14:48.524 --> 00:14:52.194
(dramatic music begins)

00:14:52.194 --> 00:14:53.195
Calmaramon's gone!

00:14:53.195 --> 00:14:54.989
So that means we won.

00:14:55.031 --> 00:14:56.490
At least it appears that way.

00:14:56.532 --> 00:14:59.035
I suppose the problem's
totally solved, right?

00:15:03.039 --> 00:15:04.540
[MetalGreymon] Trident Arm!

00:15:09.879 --> 00:15:12.381
[Tai] I'm not letting
you lay a finger on TK!

00:15:30.232 --> 00:15:33.361
-[WereGarurumon] Wolf Claw!
-Thanks, WereGarurumon.

00:15:33.402 --> 00:15:35.071
[WereGarurumon] No
worries, just go!

00:15:35.071 --> 00:15:37.073
[Matt] Appreciate it.

00:15:49.085 --> 00:15:50.044
No!

00:15:50.086 --> 00:15:51.420
Hey, wait for me!

00:15:53.589 --> 00:15:56.258
(TK struggles)

00:16:05.101 --> 00:16:06.394
Thanks, Matt!

00:16:06.435 --> 00:16:08.562
Hey, that was some nice
work there, little brother.

00:16:08.604 --> 00:16:09.939
Think you can pull it up?

00:16:09.939 --> 00:16:12.274
(TK agrees)

00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:21.117
(WereGarurumon grunts)

00:16:24.954 --> 00:16:25.955
(MetalGreymon shouts)

00:16:25.955 --> 00:16:27.790
[Tai] Metalgreymon!

00:16:32.795 --> 00:16:35.089
I'm really sorry, TK.

00:16:35.131 --> 00:16:37.299
If it'd been up to me,
I never would've let you

00:16:37.299 --> 00:16:38.968
get dragged into
this whole mess.

00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:42.805
You know what I
learned about you guys,

00:16:42.805 --> 00:16:44.932
your friends and the Digimon?

00:16:44.974 --> 00:16:48.144
I saw that you were all
working hard together,

00:16:48.144 --> 00:16:51.147
always fighting to save lots
of people who needed help.

00:16:53.149 --> 00:16:55.151
That was the moment
I thought to myself,

00:16:55.151 --> 00:16:56.944
I'm gonna do whatever
it takes so I can

00:16:56.986 --> 00:16:58.779
team up with everyone someday

00:16:58.821 --> 00:17:01.323
and fight side by
side with the Digimon,

00:17:01.323 --> 00:17:04.994
the same way that you and
Weregarurumon fight together!

00:17:04.994 --> 00:17:09.999
Just like us, huh?

00:17:13.669 --> 00:17:15.963
(WereGarurumon grunts)

00:17:16.005 --> 00:17:20.176
(WereGarurumon
groans repeatedly)

00:17:29.518 --> 00:17:32.688
(WereGarurumon yells)

00:17:37.526 --> 00:17:40.654
(bullets rain)

00:17:40.696 --> 00:17:41.864
(Matt shouts)

00:17:41.864 --> 00:17:44.200
[WereGarurumon] Matt, TK!

00:17:46.202 --> 00:17:47.328
[TK] You okay Matt?

00:17:47.369 --> 00:17:49.163
Don't you worry about me.

00:17:49.205 --> 00:17:51.499
Just do me a favor and
hang onto that egg.

00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:52.541
I will.

00:17:55.044 --> 00:17:56.045
Matt!

00:17:58.881 --> 00:17:59.882
TK!

00:18:00.716 --> 00:18:02.009
I won't give up!

00:18:02.051 --> 00:18:04.553
I'm gonna fight 'till the end!

00:18:06.222 --> 00:18:11.227
[WereGarurumon] In that
case, I won't give up either!

00:18:14.396 --> 00:18:18.234
(WereGarurumon roars)

00:18:18.234 --> 00:18:20.402
Nice, WereGarurumon.

00:18:20.402 --> 00:18:23.572
(heroic music begins)

00:18:35.584 --> 00:18:38.087
(Matt shouts)

00:18:40.256 --> 00:18:43.592
(Man sings in Japanese)

00:18:50.266 --> 00:18:51.767
[TK] What? You can fly?

00:18:52.768 --> 00:18:54.436
[Matt] He sure can.

00:18:54.436 --> 00:18:56.105
[WereGarurumon]
Thought I'd drop by!

00:18:56.105 --> 00:18:57.731
You two okay?

00:18:57.773 --> 00:18:59.608
Yeah, thanks to you!

00:19:00.442 --> 00:19:03.070
Glad to see you guys made
it back in one piece!

00:19:03.112 --> 00:19:05.573
[TK] And the Digi-Egg's
in one piece too!

00:19:05.614 --> 00:19:07.741
Way to go TK, we love to see it!

00:19:07.783 --> 00:19:10.411
[MetalGreymon] Watch your backs!

00:19:10.452 --> 00:19:11.912
[AxeKnightmon] You
shall not take that

00:19:11.954 --> 00:19:13.789
Digi-Egg away from me!

00:19:16.792 --> 00:19:19.628
(music continues)

00:19:25.801 --> 00:19:28.971
(WereGarurumon grunts)

00:19:29.805 --> 00:19:33.142
(WereGarurumon shouts)

00:19:39.982 --> 00:19:42.776
(music ends)

00:19:42.818 --> 00:19:45.988
(WereGarurumon pants)

00:19:53.162 --> 00:19:56.332
(gentle music begins)

00:20:10.012 --> 00:20:11.847
(TK gasps)

00:20:11.847 --> 00:20:13.515
Nice to meet you.

00:20:17.686 --> 00:20:18.687
Poyo poyo!

00:20:23.025 --> 00:20:27.863
-Poyo!
-(TK giggles)

00:20:30.532 --> 00:20:33.702
(Matt and Tai exclaim)

00:20:36.205 --> 00:20:37.331
[Matt] TK...

00:20:37.373 --> 00:20:39.375
[Tai] The Celestial Digimon!

00:20:40.209 --> 00:20:41.710
It finally hatched!

00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:43.671
Congratulations, little brother!

00:20:43.712 --> 00:20:44.672
(TK giggles)

00:20:44.713 --> 00:20:45.673
[Poyomon] Poyo!

00:20:45.714 --> 00:20:47.007
[MetalGreymon] Tai!

00:20:47.049 --> 00:20:49.385
[WereGarurumon] Everyone,
keep an eye out!

00:20:49.385 --> 00:20:50.678
What's the matter now?

00:20:50.719 --> 00:20:52.554
[WereGarurumon] I sense evil.

00:20:52.554 --> 00:20:54.848
Look over there!

00:20:54.890 --> 00:20:58.227
(dramatic music begins)

00:21:00.062 --> 00:21:01.230
The heck is that thing?

00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:03.232
[WereGarurumon] Yep,
what did I tell ya?

00:21:03.232 --> 00:21:05.901
There's no mistaking
it, it's him.

00:21:06.402 --> 00:21:08.362
[Matt] So we finally meet.

00:21:08.404 --> 00:21:10.072
Took him long enough.

00:21:14.743 --> 00:21:15.911
It's Devimon!

00:21:18.747 --> 00:21:21.917
[Devimon] Why, if it isn't
the Celestial Digimon.

00:21:23.252 --> 00:21:28.090
Oh, my dear old friend, I have
brought a present for you.

00:21:29.425 --> 00:21:32.094
The gift of ultimate salvation.

00:21:33.595 --> 00:21:38.600
Surrender yourself
and fall to darkness!

WereGarurumon.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.628
This Digimon digivolves
from Garurumon.

00:22:47.669 --> 00:22:49.963
The Wolf Claw attack
uses those sharp talons

00:22:50.005 --> 00:22:52.841
to slash enemies
into ribbons! Ouch!

00:22:52.841 --> 00:22:54.676
Time for a fashion check!

00:22:54.676 --> 00:22:56.970
Earrings, bangles,
and ripped jeans?

00:22:57.012 --> 00:22:58.972
WereGarurumon's got
pretty wild taste

00:22:59.014 --> 00:23:01.183
in clothes but he
does look cool!

00:23:01.183 --> 00:23:02.643
Maybe adding a
vest would make it

00:23:02.684 --> 00:23:05.020
more classy, or
even more stylish.

00:23:07.356 --> 00:23:09.525
Which Digimon will
it be next time?

00:23:11.527 --> 00:23:13.028
[Narrator] Devimon's
next digivolve

00:23:13.028 --> 00:23:15.489
puts Tai and the
others in danger.

00:23:15.531 --> 00:23:18.325
Will Izzy's plan work
in time to save the day?

00:23:18.367 --> 00:23:21.829
[Tai] Next time, "The
Messenger of Darkness, Devimon"

00:23:21.870 --> 00:23:24.373
[Narrator] The adventure
continues in a new world.
