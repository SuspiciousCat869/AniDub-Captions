[Narrator] Guided by the
power of the eight crests,

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.102
a new chapter of
the Digi-Destined's

00:01:44.135 --> 00:01:46.004
great adventure had begun.

00:01:47.138 --> 00:01:49.307
Who knows what trials
and tribulations

00:01:49.341 --> 00:01:51.009
they'll need to
face in their fight

00:01:51.042 --> 00:01:52.944
against the Great Catastrophe.

00:01:52.978 --> 00:01:55.780
(gun fires)

00:01:55.814 --> 00:01:59.351
Mimi and Palmon follow
the Digivice's direction

00:01:59.384 --> 00:02:02.954
and they eventually reach the
edge of the cloud continent.

00:02:02.988 --> 00:02:05.957
There, they find themselves
near Taneman's village

00:02:05.991 --> 00:02:08.059
where Mimi once
reigned as queen.

00:02:09.327 --> 00:02:12.664
However...

00:02:12.697 --> 00:02:15.233
(steam hisses)

00:02:16.735 --> 00:02:18.169
It's been so long.

00:02:18.203 --> 00:02:20.872
I hope everyone's alright.

00:02:20.905 --> 00:02:22.374
[Palmon] Yeah, we
should've brought

00:02:22.407 --> 00:02:24.676
Golemon and the others too.

00:02:27.012 --> 00:02:28.380
-Huh?
-Wait, what?

00:02:28.413 --> 00:02:31.182
I don't remember
this being here.

00:02:32.851 --> 00:02:36.021
(bell rings)

00:02:36.054 --> 00:02:38.857
(gentle music)

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.925
When did this get here?

00:02:42.761 --> 00:02:43.995
(Jijimon clears throat)

00:02:44.029 --> 00:02:45.764
Can I help you two
with something?

00:02:46.698 --> 00:02:49.234
Um actually, yes.

00:02:49.267 --> 00:02:51.536
Have you seen my loyal
servants, the Tanemon?

00:02:52.504 --> 00:02:54.873
They all used to live
here not too long ago.

00:02:54.906 --> 00:02:58.209
What's that? The
Tanemon you say?

00:02:58.243 --> 00:02:59.210
Oh goodness.

00:02:59.244 --> 00:03:00.578
I almost forgot.

00:03:00.612 --> 00:03:03.848
Those Tanemon are all
students here now.

00:03:03.882 --> 00:03:05.684
They're students now?

00:03:05.717 --> 00:03:07.552
They are indeed.

00:03:07.585 --> 00:03:11.389
After all, this place is now
an honorable Digimon school.

00:03:12.891 --> 00:03:14.759
One, two. One, two. One, two.

00:03:16.628 --> 00:03:19.364
Look Mimi, they're really here.

00:03:19.397 --> 00:03:20.699
(Tanemon cheer)

00:03:20.732 --> 00:03:22.200
She really came back.

00:03:22.233 --> 00:03:25.603
-(broom crashes)
-(duo yelp)

00:03:25.637 --> 00:03:27.572
Pardon me, you two.

00:03:27.605 --> 00:03:31.643
I am the principal of this
esteemed Digimon school.

00:03:33.411 --> 00:03:35.146
You can call me Babamon.

00:03:36.314 --> 00:03:37.916
Hey there, Babamon.

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.053
Our school strives to
help Digimon achieve

00:03:42.087 --> 00:03:45.890
strong, pure, and
beautiful digivolutions.

00:03:45.924 --> 00:03:49.427
That's our school motto
and that's what we offer.

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:52.964
Digivolution?

00:03:52.997 --> 00:03:54.332
Then, does that mean...

00:03:55.767 --> 00:03:57.969
I'm Mimi's servant number 6.

00:03:58.002 --> 00:03:59.804
It's me, number 12.

00:03:59.838 --> 00:04:02.240
We became Lalamon
while you were gone.

00:04:02.273 --> 00:04:04.242
No way, you're adorable.

00:04:04.275 --> 00:04:06.811
Does that mean you
digivolved from Tanemon?

00:04:06.845 --> 00:04:08.646
Uh huh. Uh huh. Uh huh.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.415
Well, what do you two think?

00:04:10.448 --> 00:04:12.083
Care to try for yourself?

00:04:12.117 --> 00:04:16.087
We are offering a
3 day trial course.

00:04:16.121 --> 00:04:17.088
[Palmon] If I do this,

00:04:17.122 --> 00:04:19.891
maybe I can digivolve
even more, Mimi.

00:04:19.924 --> 00:04:21.593
-That's a great idea.
-Let's do it.

00:04:21.626 --> 00:04:25.463
All you need to do is
sign your name right here.

00:04:27.132 --> 00:04:28.933
There. That should do it.

00:04:28.967 --> 00:04:30.335
There you go.

00:04:30.368 --> 00:04:31.903
Hey, I have an idea.

00:04:31.936 --> 00:04:33.505
What do you say we
go tour the school

00:04:33.538 --> 00:04:35.106
-and figure out-
-Silence you two.

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:36.174
(duo gasp)

00:04:36.207 --> 00:04:38.343
Now that you're officially
enrolled as students,

00:04:38.376 --> 00:04:41.613
you'll be following my
instructions from here on out.

00:04:41.646 --> 00:04:42.614
(playful music)

00:04:42.647 --> 00:04:43.948
You're Palmon, right?

00:04:43.982 --> 00:04:46.284
And your name is?

00:04:46.317 --> 00:04:48.987
I signed my name on that
document right there.

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.189
My name is Mimi Tachikawa.

00:04:51.222 --> 00:04:52.690
The one who first
established the-

00:04:52.724 --> 00:04:54.292
(Babamon groans)

00:04:54.325 --> 00:04:58.630
So your name is
Tachikawa, Mimi, Taichi...

00:04:58.663 --> 00:05:00.698
(Babamon groans)

00:05:00.732 --> 00:05:02.500
That's no good.

00:05:02.534 --> 00:05:06.204
Starting today you will
be known as Mimimon.

00:05:06.237 --> 00:05:07.405
Uh, Mimimon?

00:05:08.673 --> 00:05:10.175
You do realize I'm a human?

00:05:10.208 --> 00:05:11.209
Uh...

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:13.645
[Babmon] Quit complaining
and start running

00:05:13.678 --> 00:05:15.713
around the track, you two.

00:05:15.747 --> 00:05:18.049
(duo squeal)

00:05:18.082 --> 00:05:20.418
(duo pants)

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:26.991
Are you okay?

00:05:27.025 --> 00:05:28.159
I give up.

00:05:28.193 --> 00:05:29.661
I'm right there with you.

00:05:29.694 --> 00:05:31.563
Believe it or not, it's been

00:05:31.596 --> 00:05:34.666
harsh training like this
every day since I enrolled.

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:37.168
Today was 256 flaps.

00:05:37.202 --> 00:05:38.503
Say what?

00:05:38.536 --> 00:05:40.038
That's way too many.

00:05:40.071 --> 00:05:43.508
Mimimon, Palmon, what
are you two doing?

00:05:43.541 --> 00:05:45.910
(Lalamon gasps)

00:05:45.944 --> 00:05:48.012
Hey, isn't this all
a little too much?

00:05:48.046 --> 00:05:49.247
Yeah - what she said.

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.850
Well, aren't you two defiant?

00:05:51.883 --> 00:05:54.285
Students like you
deserve a harsh lesson.

00:05:56.421 --> 00:05:58.690
Hey what do you think
you're doing to Mimi?

00:06:00.558 --> 00:06:04.095
You both need to learn a
lesson about showing respect.

00:06:04.128 --> 00:06:06.531
Took the words right
outta my mouth.

00:06:06.564 --> 00:06:08.366
Palmon digivolve to...

00:06:08.399 --> 00:06:09.367
(upbeat music)

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:10.401
Togamon.

00:06:11.369 --> 00:06:13.771
All right, let's see
what you two are made of.

00:06:14.973 --> 00:06:17.208
Needle Spray.

00:06:17.242 --> 00:06:19.410
Wow, this is actually
quite nice (laughs).

00:06:21.579 --> 00:06:22.881
What?

00:06:22.914 --> 00:06:24.549
Would you look at that?

00:06:24.582 --> 00:06:27.151
These needles work wonders
for my back pain (laughs).

00:06:28.987 --> 00:06:31.222
(Togamon gasps)

00:06:31.256 --> 00:06:32.657
How about this?

00:06:33.758 --> 00:06:35.827
Togamon digivolve to...

00:06:41.165 --> 00:06:42.767
Lillymon.

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.571
Oh, I wonder what you
have in store for me now.

00:06:46.604 --> 00:06:47.605
Flower Cannon.

00:06:49.173 --> 00:06:50.642
(explosion)

00:06:50.675 --> 00:06:54.579
Moxa works best for back pain
but this isn't bad either.

00:06:54.612 --> 00:06:57.248
Now then.

00:06:57.282 --> 00:06:59.484
(duo yells)

00:06:59.517 --> 00:07:02.253
That ought to put you in
the mood for running laps.

00:07:02.287 --> 00:07:04.789
(duo screams)

00:07:07.992 --> 00:07:11.596
[Lillymon] I can fly but not
if it's chasing us like this.

00:07:11.629 --> 00:07:13.298
Now you're getting
the hang of it.

00:07:13.331 --> 00:07:14.332
Keep on running.

00:07:15.133 --> 00:07:18.436
(duo screams)

00:07:18.469 --> 00:07:20.972
(duo crashes)

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:25.677
I admit those were some
impressive digivolutions

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:28.513
but they're still
far too premature.

00:07:28.546 --> 00:07:30.615
If you really want
to become strong,

00:07:30.648 --> 00:07:33.017
pure, and beautiful like me,

00:07:33.051 --> 00:07:35.486
then you must start
putting in the effort.

00:07:38.323 --> 00:07:39.657
(drum beats)

00:07:39.691 --> 00:07:41.159
(gentle music)

00:07:41.192 --> 00:07:43.461
For our next class, we'll
be doing target practice

00:07:43.494 --> 00:07:46.030
for defense against bad Digimon.

00:07:46.798 --> 00:07:48.533
We really gotta show off
our skills this time.

00:07:48.566 --> 00:07:49.567
Uh huh.

00:07:51.235 --> 00:07:53.805
(bubbles burst)

00:07:53.838 --> 00:07:55.740
5 points. Who's next?

00:07:57.342 --> 00:07:59.744
(seeds fire)

00:08:00.912 --> 00:08:03.648
That's 10 points. Keep
going, who's next?

00:08:03.681 --> 00:08:05.650
Me, pick me. I go next.

00:08:05.683 --> 00:08:07.485
Show 'em how it's done.

00:08:07.518 --> 00:08:08.586
Poison Ivy.

00:08:10.888 --> 00:08:13.358
Oh my, that's 50 points.

00:08:13.391 --> 00:08:17.328
-(class cheers)
-All right, way to go Palmon.

00:08:17.362 --> 00:08:19.163
Right, you're up Mimimon.

00:08:19.197 --> 00:08:20.565
Show us what you got.

00:08:20.598 --> 00:08:22.400
-Huh?
-[Palmon] What?

00:08:22.433 --> 00:08:24.669
You mean you want me to try?

00:08:24.702 --> 00:08:26.337
Don't you have laser beam eyes

00:08:26.371 --> 00:08:29.340
or shoot missiles from
your mouth or something?

00:08:29.374 --> 00:08:32.176
No, I'm just a human.

00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:33.845
Fine, I'll give it a shot.

00:08:33.878 --> 00:08:34.879
Take that.

00:08:36.881 --> 00:08:38.082
Oopsie.

00:08:38.116 --> 00:08:39.584
(seed plonks)

00:08:39.617 --> 00:08:42.687
(Babamon growls)

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:43.688
(Mimi chuckles)

00:08:43.721 --> 00:08:45.757
Zero points to Mimimon.

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:47.191
(jaunty music)

00:08:47.225 --> 00:08:50.862
Next up, cross the
obstacle course.

00:08:50.895 --> 00:08:53.431
Hmm? But where are
all the obstacles?

00:08:53.464 --> 00:08:54.465
Here.

00:08:58.302 --> 00:09:00.371
You just have to
reach the finish line

00:09:00.405 --> 00:09:02.240
while avoiding all the brooms.

00:09:03.474 --> 00:09:05.543
I hope you're all ready.

00:09:05.576 --> 00:09:06.944
On your marks,

00:09:06.978 --> 00:09:08.413
get set...

00:09:08.446 --> 00:09:10.248
(broom fires)

00:09:10.281 --> 00:09:11.249
This is easy.

00:09:11.282 --> 00:09:13.584
Even I can do this much.
(Mimi grunts)

00:09:13.618 --> 00:09:14.952
Mimi, be careful.

00:09:14.986 --> 00:09:16.454
Watch out for the brooms.

00:09:16.487 --> 00:09:17.455
(Mimi gasps)

00:09:17.488 --> 00:09:20.625
These things can move?

00:09:20.658 --> 00:09:22.927
No fair, I can't jump that high.

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:25.329
(Mimi yelps)

00:09:27.265 --> 00:09:29.901
Oh look, zero
points for Mimimon.

00:09:29.934 --> 00:09:32.437
(Mimi groans)

00:09:33.604 --> 00:09:35.907
It's very important
that you all have

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:38.309
beautiful reflexes as Digimon.

00:09:38.342 --> 00:09:40.111
Babamon dance.

00:09:40.144 --> 00:09:41.946
Get down with your Digi-self

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:45.116
(Mimi groans)

00:09:45.149 --> 00:09:46.651
(Mimi yelps)

00:09:46.684 --> 00:09:49.454
Negative 100 points for Mimimon.

00:09:49.487 --> 00:09:51.255
(Mimi groans)

00:09:51.289 --> 00:09:53.633
Hang in there, Mimi.

00:10:00.723 --> 00:10:03.893
(Digimon snore)

00:10:06.929 --> 00:10:10.600
Man, I dunno about you
but my entire body aches.

00:10:10.633 --> 00:10:13.703
Just a couple my days, Mimi.

00:10:13.736 --> 00:10:16.539
Or we can just leave
this dumb school now.

00:10:16.572 --> 00:10:17.540
(staff clacks)

00:10:17.573 --> 00:10:19.876
(duo gasps)

00:10:19.909 --> 00:10:21.744
Oh, it's you again.

00:10:21.778 --> 00:10:22.779
What was your name?

00:10:23.813 --> 00:10:25.948
I am Jijimon.

00:10:25.982 --> 00:10:29.786
Please try to forgive
the principal.

00:10:29.819 --> 00:10:32.155
I know Babamon can be hard.

00:10:35.258 --> 00:10:38.961
You see it was not too long ago.

00:10:38.995 --> 00:10:40.897
There was a very
talented student

00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:43.633
who succeeded in
mega digivolving,

00:10:43.666 --> 00:10:46.636
but that digimon turned
into a delinquent.

00:10:46.669 --> 00:10:48.137
(mellow music)

00:10:48.171 --> 00:10:51.073
Babamon tried to teach the
student the right way to use

00:10:51.107 --> 00:10:53.910
those newfound powers
but he wouldn't listen

00:10:53.943 --> 00:10:55.812
and it ended in an argument.

00:10:55.845 --> 00:10:58.481
In the end, that student
decided to leave the school

00:10:58.514 --> 00:11:00.116
and never came back.

00:11:02.685 --> 00:11:05.421
Blaming herself for
her own incompetence,

00:11:05.455 --> 00:11:07.957
now Babamon makes sure
the lessons are taught

00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:09.659
strictly and thoroughly,

00:11:09.692 --> 00:11:12.295
in hopes that each of her
students will cultivate

00:11:12.328 --> 00:11:15.131
a good heart that
could never be swayed.

00:11:16.365 --> 00:11:19.335
Everything she does, as
tough as it may seem,

00:11:19.368 --> 00:11:21.471
is for the good of her students.

00:11:21.504 --> 00:11:22.839
Hmm.

00:11:22.872 --> 00:11:24.440
What do you think Palmon?

00:11:24.474 --> 00:11:26.008
Huh?

00:11:26.042 --> 00:11:27.510
It's only for two more days.

00:11:27.543 --> 00:11:29.946
Think we should stick with
it for a little longer?

00:11:29.979 --> 00:11:32.281
Mhmm.

00:11:32.315 --> 00:11:33.316
Thank you.

00:11:35.518 --> 00:11:38.788
I take it back. I
can't do this anymore.

00:11:38.821 --> 00:11:40.022
(cheery music)

00:11:40.056 --> 00:11:41.791
It's impossible to
avoid these things.

00:11:41.824 --> 00:11:44.794
You're gonna have to pick
up the pace, Mimimon.

00:11:44.827 --> 00:11:46.262
And that goes for you too.

00:11:46.295 --> 00:11:48.297
Oh man, this is
rough huh, Agumon?

00:11:48.331 --> 00:11:49.699
No kidding.

00:11:49.732 --> 00:11:50.800
Huh?

00:11:50.833 --> 00:11:53.369
Wait, what are you two
doing in a place like this?

00:11:53.402 --> 00:11:55.304
Well, we just happened to
be in the neighborhood so...

00:11:55.338 --> 00:11:56.873
It looked like lots of fun

00:11:56.906 --> 00:11:59.375
so we signed our names
and got enrolled.

00:11:59.408 --> 00:12:00.376
Huh.

00:12:00.409 --> 00:12:01.377
(Mimi chuckles)

00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:02.645
[Babamon] Pick up the pace.

00:12:02.678 --> 00:12:04.814
Just 'cause you're new
doesn't mean you can slack.

00:12:04.847 --> 00:12:06.349
[Students] Yes ma'am.

00:12:21.597 --> 00:12:24.233
(Mimi yells)

00:12:24.267 --> 00:12:25.501
[Babamon] 10 points.

00:12:25.535 --> 00:12:27.904
-(class cheers)
-Whoa, I hit it.

00:12:27.937 --> 00:12:29.372
That was awesome, Mimi.

00:12:29.405 --> 00:12:31.173
Is that me?

00:12:31.207 --> 00:12:32.408
(Mimi laughs)

00:12:32.441 --> 00:12:35.678
Looks like I moved up a little
from zero points, didn't I?

00:12:35.711 --> 00:12:36.679
(Babamon laughs)

00:12:36.712 --> 00:12:39.015
You still have a long way to go.

00:12:39.048 --> 00:12:40.516
What?

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:42.585
I'll get 20 points next time.

00:12:42.618 --> 00:12:44.687
Just you wait. I'm gonna do it.

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:45.688
(Babamon chuckles)

00:12:45.721 --> 00:12:47.857
I'll believe it when I see it.

00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:49.025
-(explosion)
-(Babamon yelps)

00:12:49.058 --> 00:12:50.426
What is that?

00:12:50.459 --> 00:12:53.296
(Jijimon screams)

00:12:56.232 --> 00:12:58.367
Long time no see.

00:12:58.401 --> 00:13:01.070
(Babamon gasps)

00:13:02.638 --> 00:13:05.474
Did you miss me,
Principal Babamon?

00:13:06.909 --> 00:13:08.244
BanchoMamemon.

00:13:13.583 --> 00:13:16.085
(tense music)

00:13:22.425 --> 00:13:24.427
Are you sure you're
okay, Jijimon?

00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:26.629
Yes, but never mind me.

00:13:26.662 --> 00:13:28.230
That's the student I mentioned

00:13:28.264 --> 00:13:30.933
who became a delinquent
and disappeared.

00:13:32.668 --> 00:13:33.903
Well, well, well.

00:13:33.936 --> 00:13:36.305
I always knew you'd
come crawling back.

00:13:36.339 --> 00:13:38.407
I came back to thank you

00:13:38.441 --> 00:13:42.244
for casting me aside, like
the rotten digimon you are,

00:13:42.278 --> 00:13:45.147
after I digivolved
into a mega digimon.

00:13:45.181 --> 00:13:47.817
Oh. Well, isn't that
kind of him to do?

00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:49.619
Mimi, something tells me

00:13:49.652 --> 00:13:51.954
he didn't come back
just to say thank you.

00:13:51.988 --> 00:13:53.155
Huh?

00:13:53.189 --> 00:13:54.657
[Babamon] You really
still don't understand

00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:57.326
the reason I never
acknowledged you.

00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:58.494
The reason?

00:13:58.527 --> 00:14:01.330
Of course, 'cause
you're a rotten digimon.

00:14:01.364 --> 00:14:02.598
Zero points.

00:14:02.632 --> 00:14:04.800
If you can't find the
answer for yourself,

00:14:04.834 --> 00:14:06.902
then no diploma for you.

00:14:06.936 --> 00:14:08.671
You really think
that's what I need?

00:14:08.704 --> 00:14:11.641
No, I can graduate
on my own terms.

00:14:11.674 --> 00:14:13.175
Don't you get it?

00:14:13.209 --> 00:14:16.679
I have nothing left to learn
from you and I'll prove it.

00:14:16.712 --> 00:14:18.180
Ready everyone?

00:14:18.214 --> 00:14:21.275
It's time for a little class
reunion, don't you think?

00:14:25.846 --> 00:14:27.948
(digimon trill)

00:14:27.982 --> 00:14:29.483
Don't you dare
touch the students.

00:14:29.517 --> 00:14:30.484
[BanchoMamemon] Oruaaaaaaaaah.

00:14:30.518 --> 00:14:32.920
(Babamon growls)

00:14:32.953 --> 00:14:35.823
(weapons clang)

00:14:35.856 --> 00:14:38.192
(duo groan)

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:44.365
-(guns fire)
-(students scream)

00:14:47.668 --> 00:14:48.669
Agumon.

00:14:50.971 --> 00:14:52.973
Agumon digivolve to...

00:15:00.047 --> 00:15:01.048
Greymon.

00:15:01.882 --> 00:15:03.784
Ready, Palmon?

00:15:03.818 --> 00:15:05.986
Palmon digivolve to...

00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:07.021
Togamon.

00:15:08.222 --> 00:15:10.291
(Greymon grunts)

00:15:10.324 --> 00:15:12.626
Everyone, get behind Greymon.

00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:14.061
-(digimon squeak)
-Huh?

00:15:14.995 --> 00:15:18.299
(Jijimon laughs)

00:15:18.332 --> 00:15:19.700
Allow me to help.

00:15:19.734 --> 00:15:21.001
I owe you one.

00:15:21.035 --> 00:15:24.739
Oruah, oruah, oruah,
oruah, oruah, oruah...

00:15:25.673 --> 00:15:28.509
(Babamon grunts)

00:15:28.542 --> 00:15:32.546
Oruah, oruah, oruah,
oruah, oruah, oruah...

00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:35.916
rah-rah-rah-rah-rah-rah-rah-rah.

00:15:36.751 --> 00:15:38.352
Empress Haze.

00:15:38.385 --> 00:15:40.721
(explosion)

00:15:42.423 --> 00:15:44.191
Ooooooraaaaah!

00:15:44.225 --> 00:15:46.393
(balls thud)

00:15:46.427 --> 00:15:48.863
Orah, orah, orah, orah, orah.

00:15:49.764 --> 00:15:51.866
Heh, you have a lot to learn.

00:15:51.899 --> 00:15:53.901
-Oh?
-(chain rattles)

00:15:53.934 --> 00:15:55.836
When did you do this?

00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:58.539
(Babamon gasps)

00:15:59.406 --> 00:16:01.175
There's no escape, Babamon.

00:16:01.208 --> 00:16:06.213
Looks like the bases
are loaded for me.

00:16:06.781 --> 00:16:08.048
(Togamon roars)

00:16:08.082 --> 00:16:10.718
(ball cracks)

00:16:10.751 --> 00:16:11.919
Huh?

00:16:11.952 --> 00:16:14.588
(heroic music)

00:16:14.622 --> 00:16:16.557
Who are you? State
your name at once.

00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:18.392
Well, I'm a student enrolled

00:16:18.425 --> 00:16:21.428
in the 3 day trial
course, Mimimon.

00:16:21.462 --> 00:16:22.696
What are you going?

00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:25.199
Principal Babamon, you
should just be honest

00:16:25.232 --> 00:16:29.436
and tell him: Bancho, you gave
up 'cause things got tough.

00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:31.939
You're a dropout, a failure.

00:16:31.972 --> 00:16:33.407
Negative trillion points.

00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:37.945
Why you little brat.

00:16:39.113 --> 00:16:41.048
[Babamon] Mimimon.

00:16:41.081 --> 00:16:43.417
(bat whirs)

00:16:43.984 --> 00:16:47.087
[Mimi] The broom - just
like the obstacle course.

00:16:47.121 --> 00:16:49.723
(Mimi grunts)

00:16:49.757 --> 00:16:51.725
Try dodging this.

00:16:51.759 --> 00:16:54.061
[Togamon] Needle Spray.

00:16:54.094 --> 00:16:56.297
Nice one, Togamon.

00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:58.599
I'll take you both down (yelps).

00:16:58.632 --> 00:17:00.401
Aw, come on, seriously?

00:17:00.434 --> 00:17:02.403
You know what to do.

00:17:02.436 --> 00:17:04.505
Togamon digivolve to...

00:17:08.275 --> 00:17:09.777
Lillymon.

00:17:09.810 --> 00:17:11.612
Flower Cannon.

00:17:11.645 --> 00:17:13.080
(Cannon fires)

00:17:13.113 --> 00:17:14.481
(Banchomamemon roars)

00:17:14.515 --> 00:17:16.584
(Lillymon gasps)

00:17:16.617 --> 00:17:18.586
Look alive. Batter up.

00:17:18.619 --> 00:17:20.788
Babamon dance time.

00:17:20.821 --> 00:17:23.257
(Lillymon grunts)

00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:24.491
What is this?

00:17:24.525 --> 00:17:26.927
(Lillymon grunts)

00:17:26.961 --> 00:17:28.429
(chains rattle)

00:17:28.462 --> 00:17:30.764
It doesn't matter what you know,

00:17:30.798 --> 00:17:32.967
my strength is unmatched.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.669
(Lillymon growls)

00:17:35.703 --> 00:17:38.005
I'll admit you're a
pretty strong digimon.

00:17:38.038 --> 00:17:41.508
That being said, you aren't
very pure or beautiful at all.

00:17:41.542 --> 00:17:43.177
What's that supposed to mean?

00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:45.312
-(energetic music)
-Lillymon,

00:17:45.346 --> 00:17:48.349
it's time to show off the
results of our training.

00:17:48.382 --> 00:17:49.383
Okay Mimi.

00:17:50.217 --> 00:17:51.852
-Strongly.
-Purely.

00:17:51.886 --> 00:17:53.387
And Beautifully.

00:17:55.823 --> 00:17:57.992
Lillymon digivolve to...

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:03.497
(singing in Japanese)

00:18:05.199 --> 00:18:06.200
Rosemon.

00:18:08.002 --> 00:18:09.003
No way.

00:18:09.837 --> 00:18:12.172
[Babamon] Well, I'll be...

00:18:13.674 --> 00:18:15.175
Incredible.

00:18:15.209 --> 00:18:16.310
(digimon coo)

00:18:16.343 --> 00:18:18.012
My goodness.

00:18:18.045 --> 00:18:19.013
Mimi.

00:18:19.046 --> 00:18:20.481
Rosemon.

00:18:20.514 --> 00:18:23.484
(BanchoMamemon roars)

00:18:23.517 --> 00:18:24.885
(fire roars)

00:18:24.919 --> 00:18:28.222
So you became a mega
digimon, big flipping deal.

00:18:28.255 --> 00:18:29.323
(gun fires)

00:18:29.356 --> 00:18:30.391
Thorn Whip.

00:18:31.926 --> 00:18:34.328
(explosions)

00:18:34.361 --> 00:18:35.562
Ooooooraaaaah

00:18:37.031 --> 00:18:39.600
(weapon whips)

00:18:44.038 --> 00:18:45.739
(fire roars)

00:18:45.773 --> 00:18:47.041
Rosemon.

00:18:47.074 --> 00:18:48.075
(BanchoMamemon laughs)

00:18:48.108 --> 00:18:50.077
Can you handle the heat?

00:18:51.745 --> 00:18:52.947
[Rosemon] Ha.

00:18:54.048 --> 00:18:55.749
Are you kidding me?

00:18:55.783 --> 00:18:56.884
Rose Spear.

00:18:58.953 --> 00:19:01.922
(BanchoMamemon roars)

00:19:01.956 --> 00:19:02.923
(whip snaps)

00:19:02.957 --> 00:19:06.226
(BanchoMamemon grunts)

00:19:10.064 --> 00:19:11.598
This can't be.

00:19:11.632 --> 00:19:13.767
I'm a Mega Digimon.

00:19:13.801 --> 00:19:15.235
(gentle music)

00:19:15.269 --> 00:19:17.905
Funny enough, you actually
answered that yourself earlier.

00:19:17.938 --> 00:19:19.273
I did?

00:19:19.306 --> 00:19:20.541
That's right.

00:19:20.574 --> 00:19:23.277
You became Mega
Digimon - big deal.

00:19:24.812 --> 00:19:27.948
I think you are finally
starting to understand

00:19:27.982 --> 00:19:30.651
what principle Babamon
wanted you to learn.

00:19:35.155 --> 00:19:37.491
Forbidden Temptation.

00:19:39.126 --> 00:19:42.296
(BanchoMamemon gasps)

00:19:46.667 --> 00:19:48.936
I guess I lost. It's over.

00:19:51.138 --> 00:19:53.474
So then, what's next for you?

00:19:53.507 --> 00:19:54.641
Huh?

00:19:54.675 --> 00:19:56.910
If you still want
that diploma of yours,

00:19:56.944 --> 00:19:59.913
you're more than welcome
to try studying here again.

00:19:59.947 --> 00:20:01.081
Okay, fine.

00:20:01.115 --> 00:20:02.349
I'll do it.

00:20:02.383 --> 00:20:04.918
I guess being lectured wasn't
the worst thing in the world.

00:20:04.952 --> 00:20:07.121
(Babamon chuckles)

00:20:07.154 --> 00:20:08.689
Mimimon, Rosemon,

00:20:09.690 --> 00:20:12.326
you both earn full marks.

00:20:12.359 --> 00:20:16.296
Yeah, we did it.

00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:19.666
[Tai] By the way, you're
really strong Jijimon.

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:23.470
(Jijimon chuckles)

00:20:23.504 --> 00:20:26.273
-I grant you your diploma.
-(uplifting music)

00:20:26.306 --> 00:20:28.142
Stand proud Palmon.

00:20:28.175 --> 00:20:31.478
By giving you this
diploma, I hereby recognize

00:20:31.512 --> 00:20:33.447
that you have followed
the school principles

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:35.015
by reaching a strong, pure,

00:20:35.049 --> 00:20:37.551
beautiful, and
genuine digivolution.

00:20:41.555 --> 00:20:43.290
(group applauds)

00:20:43.323 --> 00:20:45.893
(Digimon cheer)

00:20:49.163 --> 00:20:50.864
Can I help you with something?

00:20:50.898 --> 00:20:52.966
I'm ready to accept
my diploma now.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.169
Oh gimme a break, Mimimon.

00:20:55.202 --> 00:20:58.639
You got a long way to
go until you graduate.

00:20:58.672 --> 00:21:00.541
How come?

00:21:00.574 --> 00:21:02.042
Huh?

00:21:02.076 --> 00:21:04.845
(digivice beeps)

00:21:05.746 --> 00:21:06.713
That's weird.

00:21:06.747 --> 00:21:07.748
What is this?

00:21:08.515 --> 00:21:10.384
That's a flashy looking diploma.

00:21:10.417 --> 00:21:13.087
No, this is...

00:21:15.022 --> 00:21:17.691
I confirmed the response
on my side as well.

00:21:18.759 --> 00:21:21.395
I can only assume that
Mimi was able to get closer

00:21:21.428 --> 00:21:23.197
to unveiling the
crest's mystery.

00:21:25.365 --> 00:21:27.701
That means we did it, Mimi.

00:21:27.734 --> 00:21:30.704
Yeah, and it's all
thanks to you guys.

[Izzy] Now for the
Digimon encyclopedia.

00:22:43.443 --> 00:22:47.648
Rosemon: Lillymon digivolves
into this digimon of beauty.

00:22:47.681 --> 00:22:49.783
By elegantly waving
a thorned whip,

00:22:49.816 --> 00:22:52.653
Rosemon can tame nearly
any ferocious digimon.

00:22:52.686 --> 00:22:54.655
(Palmon laughs)

00:22:54.688 --> 00:22:56.123
Palmon?

00:22:56.156 --> 00:22:58.926
[Palmon] Silence, now
that I've become Rosemon,

00:22:58.959 --> 00:23:02.629
you must now only
address me as your Queen.

00:23:02.663 --> 00:23:04.131
[Izzy] Yes, sorry my Queen.

00:23:05.699 --> 00:23:06.934
(heroic music)

00:23:06.967 --> 00:23:09.203
Which digimon will
it be next time?

00:23:10.437 --> 00:23:12.973
[Narrator] A misty
forest where screams echo

00:23:13.006 --> 00:23:15.976
is the perfect place for the
hero with the legendary blade

00:23:16.009 --> 00:23:17.611
to make a return.

00:23:17.644 --> 00:23:20.614
[Tai] Next time: The Gold
Wolf of the Crescent Moon.

00:23:20.647 --> 00:23:23.550
[Narrator] The adventure
continues in a new world.
