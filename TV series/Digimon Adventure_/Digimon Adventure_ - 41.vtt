[Narrator] This is
the mysterious world

00:01:42.306 --> 00:01:45.809
where Digimon live,
the Digital World.

00:01:45.843 --> 00:01:48.512
Tai, Kari, and the other
Digi-destined children

00:01:48.545 --> 00:01:51.181
alongside their loyal
Digimon partners

00:01:51.215 --> 00:01:53.784
continue on their adventure.

00:01:53.817 --> 00:01:57.621
Traveling with them is
Patamon, the Celestial Digimon,

00:01:57.654 --> 00:01:59.823
who is the key to
saving the world.

00:02:00.524 --> 00:02:03.293
The powers and noble
wings that were once taken

00:02:03.327 --> 00:02:05.996
from Patamon have
slowly begun to return

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:08.398
as his bond with TK strengthens.

00:02:09.833 --> 00:02:11.034
And now...

00:02:13.237 --> 00:02:16.173
(Patamom giggling)

00:02:20.077 --> 00:02:22.646
[Biyomon] (groans) That sure
was a big hill back there!

00:02:22.679 --> 00:02:25.182
[Sora] You earned
some rest Komondomon.

00:02:25.215 --> 00:02:26.283
(Komnondomon woof-grunts)

00:02:26.316 --> 00:02:29.486
I don't know about you,
but I could use a nap too.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.021
I'm way ahead of you.

00:02:31.054 --> 00:02:32.022
(Joe sighs)

00:02:32.055 --> 00:02:33.957
How's that feel? Relaxed yet?

00:02:33.991 --> 00:02:37.127
It's amazing. I owe
you one Gomamon.

00:02:37.161 --> 00:02:39.696
(laughs) Don't worry.
I'll send you the bill.

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.965
Are we staying here
tonight Gatomon?

00:02:41.999 --> 00:02:43.367
Uh huh.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.836
I don't sense any
threats here, so why not?

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:47.304
Yeah, well just in case,

00:02:47.337 --> 00:02:50.007
Agumon and I will go
ahead and scout the area.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.009
Wait, I can come too!

00:02:52.042 --> 00:02:54.478
Yahoo! Merit badges.

00:02:54.511 --> 00:02:55.879
(Tai laughs)

00:02:55.913 --> 00:03:00.217
Um, I don't think you understand
what scout means, Agumon.

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.486
Well anyway, we'll look
around for any food nearby.

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:03.520
-Yeah!
-Yeah.

00:03:09.693 --> 00:03:11.728
You could've stayed
back there, ya know.

00:03:11.762 --> 00:03:14.831
I know, but I don't wanna
sit around. I wanna help!

00:03:14.865 --> 00:03:15.866
I hear ya.

00:03:21.538 --> 00:03:23.273
It's pretty foggy out here.

00:03:24.107 --> 00:03:25.909
What if we get lost.

00:03:27.444 --> 00:03:29.913
Yeah, maybe we should head back?

00:03:29.947 --> 00:03:31.381
Huh?

00:03:31.415 --> 00:03:32.516
What's up TK?

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:34.851
Straight up ahead. See that?

00:03:34.885 --> 00:03:36.687
(mysterious music)

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.755
That wasn't there
earlier, was it?

00:03:46.063 --> 00:03:47.364
Huh?

00:03:47.397 --> 00:03:50.400
A Ferris wheel and
a roller-coaster?

00:03:51.401 --> 00:03:53.704
That's weird. It's a theme park.

00:03:53.737 --> 00:03:55.038
In a forest?

00:03:55.072 --> 00:03:56.540
What's a theme park?

00:03:56.573 --> 00:03:58.775
Theme parks are fun
places in our world

00:03:58.809 --> 00:04:00.777
where you can go on rides!

00:04:00.811 --> 00:04:03.714
But why is it here
in the Digital world?

00:04:03.747 --> 00:04:05.782
Hey Matt, you see that?

00:04:05.816 --> 00:04:07.618
(mysterious music)

00:04:07.651 --> 00:04:09.953
(Opossummon giggles
mischievously)

00:04:09.987 --> 00:04:13.423
[Opossummon] This is the
park's mascot, Monzaemon!

00:04:13.457 --> 00:04:16.126
-(Opossummon giggling)
-(all gasp)

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:19.463
(electronic music)

00:04:19.496 --> 00:04:22.132
(Opossummon giggling)

00:04:22.165 --> 00:04:23.934
And who are you?"

00:04:23.967 --> 00:04:27.738
Relax you guys! I'm not
one of those evil Digimon.

00:04:27.771 --> 00:04:30.607
I'm Opossummon,
and I'm your guide

00:04:30.641 --> 00:04:32.909
to the amazing Mon-Mon Park!

00:04:32.943 --> 00:04:34.911
Mon-Mon Park?

00:04:34.945 --> 00:04:37.648
Yup! This is where all
Digimon come to play.

00:04:37.681 --> 00:04:41.084
A land of nonstop fun
and dream come true!

00:04:41.118 --> 00:04:44.655
Well, it would be, but as you
can see we're a bit empty.

00:04:44.688 --> 00:04:45.922
Kinda sad.

00:04:45.956 --> 00:04:47.324
But that doesn't matter anymore

00:04:47.357 --> 00:04:49.426
because we finally
have customers!

00:04:49.459 --> 00:04:52.062
Yippee! I'm so happy!

00:04:52.863 --> 00:04:55.265
Sorry but we're not
really customers.

00:04:55.299 --> 00:04:57.868
We were actually out
here trying to find food.

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:00.170
Really?

00:05:01.038 --> 00:05:04.608
-Oh okay.
-(deflated music)

00:05:04.641 --> 00:05:06.009
-Come on, Matt.
-(Opossummon groaning)

00:05:06.043 --> 00:05:08.912
I feel bad why don't we hang
around for a little bit?

00:05:09.646 --> 00:05:11.848
Fine, but we can't
stay too long.

00:05:11.882 --> 00:05:13.684
(Opossummon laughs)

00:05:13.717 --> 00:05:16.787
Yay! I promise you
won't regret it!

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:18.655
Mon-Mon Park, open!

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:19.823
(fingers snap)

00:05:19.856 --> 00:05:22.659
(carnival music)

00:05:29.399 --> 00:05:31.735
(TK laughs)

00:05:32.703 --> 00:05:36.673
(Opossummon chuckles wickedly)

00:05:40.377 --> 00:05:42.312
[Patamon] So high.

00:05:42.346 --> 00:05:44.681
How come we can't really
see anything from here.

00:05:46.016 --> 00:05:47.217
[Matt] Well that's odd.

00:05:48.552 --> 00:05:49.853
Oh hey, Matt.

00:05:51.688 --> 00:05:53.156
Do you remember?

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:56.860
We once came to a theme park
one time, with all of us.

00:05:57.861 --> 00:05:58.862
I do.

00:05:59.763 --> 00:06:02.699
(melancholy music)

00:06:04.034 --> 00:06:06.069
I remember it like
it was yesterday.

00:06:06.103 --> 00:06:08.171
[TK] We had so much fun.

00:06:08.205 --> 00:06:09.673
We did.

00:06:09.706 --> 00:06:12.209
But we never ended up going
into the haunted house.

00:06:12.242 --> 00:06:15.412
Because you kept saying you
were too scared to go inside.

00:06:15.445 --> 00:06:18.215
What? you were scared
for once, Matt?

00:06:18.248 --> 00:06:20.250
Yeah, so what?

00:06:20.283 --> 00:06:23.186
You were the one crying all day
because you were too chicken

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:25.021
to try the roller-coaster!

00:06:25.055 --> 00:06:27.023
Is that true, TK?

00:06:27.057 --> 00:06:30.093
Huh? Oh is that what happened?

00:06:30.127 --> 00:06:31.128
It sure did!

00:06:33.263 --> 00:06:36.266
(everyone laughing)

00:06:41.271 --> 00:06:42.773
What did you see TK?

00:06:43.774 --> 00:06:45.876
Look, it's a carousel!

00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:48.078
Really? A carousel.

00:06:48.111 --> 00:06:51.915
(melancholy music continues)

00:07:05.262 --> 00:07:07.397
(footsteps tapping)

00:07:07.431 --> 00:07:08.432
Back then we...

00:07:11.301 --> 00:07:13.570
(Xiaomon groaning)

00:07:13.603 --> 00:07:14.738
Huh?

00:07:14.771 --> 00:07:16.306
(TK gasps)

00:07:16.339 --> 00:07:17.808
(Xiaomon groaning)

00:07:17.841 --> 00:07:20.477
Are you okay? What happened?

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:23.013
Run while you can.

00:07:23.513 --> 00:07:24.781
Danger. Danger.

00:07:25.782 --> 00:07:26.750
-(ominous music)
-Huh?

00:07:26.783 --> 00:07:29.653
Everyone's, going to-

00:07:29.686 --> 00:07:30.687
What?

00:07:31.655 --> 00:07:33.490
(Opossummon laughing
mischievously)

00:07:33.523 --> 00:07:34.958
Whoopsie-daisy!

00:07:36.026 --> 00:07:38.595
Looks like one got away from me.

00:07:38.628 --> 00:07:40.664
What do you mean by that?

00:07:40.697 --> 00:07:43.667
Well I was gonna wait until
you let your guard down,

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:45.268
But you leave me no choice.

00:07:45.302 --> 00:07:46.303
(fingers snap)

00:07:46.336 --> 00:07:48.939

(all gasp)

00:07:51.308 --> 00:07:53.677
I knew I got a weird
vibe from that guy.

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:56.346
(Opossummon chuckles wickedly)

00:07:56.379 --> 00:07:59.883
(ominous music continues)

00:08:05.489 --> 00:08:06.523
Ready?

00:08:06.556 --> 00:08:07.657
Mm mm.

00:08:07.691 --> 00:08:09.192
Patamon!

00:08:09.226 --> 00:08:10.527
Patamon digivolve to...

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:13.363

Show 'em what you got!

00:10:05.442 --> 00:10:08.144
That voice came from over here.

00:10:08.178 --> 00:10:09.479
Big brother.

00:10:09.512 --> 00:10:11.314
(Xiaomon whimpers)

00:10:11.348 --> 00:10:15.085
Where did that dirty
Opossum run off to?

00:10:15.118 --> 00:10:16.119
Can you hear me?

00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:18.455
[TK] Over here!

00:10:19.789 --> 00:10:20.790
TK!

00:10:22.359 --> 00:10:24.594
[TK] Matt help!

00:10:24.628 --> 00:10:26.596
It's coming from in here.

00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:30.367
(suspenseful music continues)

00:10:31.701 --> 00:10:33.470
Is this the kind
of haunted house

00:10:33.503 --> 00:10:35.672
you two were talking
about earlier?

00:10:35.705 --> 00:10:37.173
Yeah sort of.

00:10:37.207 --> 00:10:39.609
Except this one's even
creepier if that's possible.

00:10:39.643 --> 00:10:40.844
What?

00:10:40.877 --> 00:10:42.646
Uh, it's nothing!
Just ignore me.

00:10:44.547 --> 00:10:45.615
Huh?

00:10:45.649 --> 00:10:46.650
What's wrong?

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:52.489
Big brother!

00:10:52.522 --> 00:10:54.357
Big brother!

00:10:54.391 --> 00:10:55.392
Big brother!

00:10:56.826 --> 00:10:57.961
(Opossummon laughs
mischievously)

00:10:57.994 --> 00:10:59.863
[Opossummon] You
actually fell for it?

00:10:59.896 --> 00:11:01.531
It was a trap!

00:11:01.564 --> 00:11:05.001
(ominous music)

00:11:05.035 --> 00:11:07.804
(Matt gasps)

00:11:07.837 --> 00:11:09.339
You said everyone earlier.

00:11:09.372 --> 00:11:12.042
Does that mean there
are others besides you?

00:11:12.075 --> 00:11:13.643
There are.

00:11:13.677 --> 00:11:17.881
My friends who wandered in
here, were also captured.

00:11:17.914 --> 00:11:21.217
And swallowed by a
huge scary monster!

00:11:21.251 --> 00:11:26.189
(TK gasps)

00:11:35.699 --> 00:11:39.002
(dramatic music)

00:11:39.035 --> 00:11:41.705
(pensive music)

00:11:42.872 --> 00:11:45.341
What do you mean they
were "swallowed"?

00:11:45.375 --> 00:11:48.344
You see, before the
black lightning stopped.

00:11:48.378 --> 00:11:50.513
We were terrified
and hid in the forest

00:11:50.547 --> 00:11:52.582
just to get some kind of cover.

00:11:52.615 --> 00:11:55.752
When suddenly, this
place appeared before us.

00:11:55.785 --> 00:11:58.555
It was full of things
we'd never seen before

00:11:58.588 --> 00:12:00.890
and everyone was
excited to try them!

00:12:01.791 --> 00:12:03.727
Then, without any warning.

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:06.429
(ominous music)

00:12:09.065 --> 00:12:12.736
(monster balloons growling)

00:12:19.075 --> 00:12:21.745
(eerie howling)

00:12:26.149 --> 00:12:29.552
(gasps) You mean they
terrorized you in a place

00:12:29.586 --> 00:12:32.255
where you're supposed to
make your happiest memories?

00:12:33.456 --> 00:12:35.925
Don't worry. We'll show 'em!

00:12:35.959 --> 00:12:40.296
(Opossummon laughs
mischievously)

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:41.431
That sound again.

00:12:44.934 --> 00:12:46.236
Hup.

00:12:46.269 --> 00:12:47.470
Rodeo Kick!

00:12:47.504 --> 00:12:50.740
(metallic crashing)

00:12:50.774 --> 00:12:52.108
(Opossummon laughs
mischievously)

00:12:52.142 --> 00:12:54.310
Made you look! Made you look!

00:12:54.344 --> 00:12:57.347
(suspenseful music)

00:13:06.122 --> 00:13:08.158
You know what time it is.

00:13:08.191 --> 00:13:10.960
(dramatic music)

00:13:19.135 --> 00:13:21.371
Garurumon digivolve to...

00:13:37.053 --> 00:13:38.221
Weregarurumon!

00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:42.625
(dramatic music continues)

00:13:42.659 --> 00:13:45.728
(WereGarurumon roars)

00:13:48.331 --> 00:13:50.233
We're coming for you.

00:13:52.735 --> 00:13:53.703
(tense music)

00:13:53.736 --> 00:13:55.538
Snack time! Snack time!

00:13:55.572 --> 00:13:57.340
I hope you're hungry buddy.

00:13:57.373 --> 00:13:58.875
[TK] Let him go!

00:14:00.043 --> 00:14:01.678
If you say so!

00:14:01.711 --> 00:14:03.146
(zip zipping)

00:14:03.179 --> 00:14:05.315
(air whooshing)

00:14:05.348 --> 00:14:06.649
Whoopsie Daisy!

00:14:06.683 --> 00:14:08.484
(Xiaomon screams)

00:14:08.518 --> 00:14:10.053
(TK gasps)

00:14:10.086 --> 00:14:14.757
Now then, feast your eyes on
Mon-Mon Park's real mascot!

00:14:15.692 --> 00:14:16.860
WaruMonzaemon!

00:14:19.028 --> 00:14:20.897
(dramatic tense music)

00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:24.100
(Warumonzaemon roars)

00:14:29.272 --> 00:14:33.009
Warumonzaemon, an
ultimate Digimon.

00:14:33.042 --> 00:14:36.079
Alright, now swallow
those chumps too!

00:14:36.112 --> 00:14:39.415
And become even
stronger, WaruMonzaemon!

00:14:39.449 --> 00:14:41.517
Rodeo Kick!

00:14:41.551 --> 00:14:43.253
(claws clanging)

00:14:43.286 --> 00:14:45.521
Star Shower!

00:14:45.555 --> 00:14:48.291
(stars twinkling)

00:14:51.294 --> 00:14:52.762
(Opossummon laughs
mischievously)

00:14:52.795 --> 00:14:55.865
Not gonna work! Not gonna work!

00:14:55.899 --> 00:14:58.268
WaruMonzaemon swallowed
up so many Digimon

00:14:58.301 --> 00:15:00.870
that he's practically
unbeatable!

00:15:00.904 --> 00:15:02.772
Equus Beam!

00:15:02.805 --> 00:15:05.575
(beams blasting)

00:15:07.477 --> 00:15:09.212
(both grunting)

00:15:09.245 --> 00:15:11.214
And he's going to
become even stronger

00:15:11.247 --> 00:15:13.116
with you as nutrients!

00:15:13.149 --> 00:15:15.551
I can't wait! So much fun!

00:15:15.585 --> 00:15:17.053
Nutrients?

00:15:17.086 --> 00:15:18.221
You betcha!

00:15:18.254 --> 00:15:20.056
We're actually
sucking the energy

00:15:20.089 --> 00:15:23.059
from tons of helpless
Digimon as we speak!

00:15:23.092 --> 00:15:26.629
Thanks to that, WaruMonzaemon
can become infinitely strong!

00:15:26.663 --> 00:15:29.332
My adorable, gigantic
WaruMonzaemon.

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:32.468
(Opossummon laughs
mischievously)

00:15:32.502 --> 00:15:34.470
Everyone's in there.

00:15:34.504 --> 00:15:36.105
-Pegasusmon!
-Right!

00:15:38.508 --> 00:15:41.077
What is that giant thing?!

00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:42.645
TK!

00:15:42.679 --> 00:15:45.748
Yay! Look how eager
they are to feed you!

00:15:45.782 --> 00:15:47.817
Open wide, WaruMonzaemon!

00:15:51.854 --> 00:15:52.855
TK! Stop!

00:15:54.023 --> 00:15:56.826
(dramatic music)

00:15:56.859 --> 00:15:58.861
Wolf Claw!

00:15:59.963 --> 00:16:00.964
Aargh!

00:16:05.201 --> 00:16:08.271
(TK grunting)

00:16:08.304 --> 00:16:10.540
(TK yells)

00:16:12.475 --> 00:16:13.676
Patamon!

00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:15.111
I'm okay.

00:16:15.144 --> 00:16:16.512
I see.

00:16:16.546 --> 00:16:19.983
So you two ended up getting
swallowed up as well.

00:16:24.354 --> 00:16:26.889
(somber music)

00:16:29.058 --> 00:16:31.127
We're trapped. All of us.

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:33.563
We're being forced to
stay on this ride forever.

00:16:37.567 --> 00:16:40.703
TK, it's sucking their energy!

00:16:40.737 --> 00:16:42.171
(TK yells)

00:16:42.205 --> 00:16:45.041
It's no use, you'll
only hurt yourselves.

00:16:45.074 --> 00:16:47.043
No one ever escapes
from this place.

00:16:47.076 --> 00:16:50.146
Come on! You can't
just give up yet!

00:16:50.179 --> 00:16:52.815
Soon all our minds will
go completely blank.

00:16:52.849 --> 00:16:56.052
and we'll continue
to go around forever.

00:16:56.085 --> 00:16:57.854
Forever and forever.

00:17:00.089 --> 00:17:01.257
And forever.

00:17:02.425 --> 00:17:05.395
(Opossummon laughs
mischievously)

00:17:05.428 --> 00:17:07.930
Oh, no! Why am I losing energy?

00:17:09.932 --> 00:17:10.933
So tired.

00:17:11.934 --> 00:17:12.935
Me too.

00:17:16.873 --> 00:17:19.675
Thanks to your friends
offering themselves up,

00:17:19.709 --> 00:17:22.345
Warumonzaemon has
gotten even stronger.

00:17:22.378 --> 00:17:24.180
Which means they're
all probably getting

00:17:24.213 --> 00:17:27.050
their life sucked out of
them at this very moment!

00:17:27.083 --> 00:17:28.284
You little...

00:17:30.119 --> 00:17:31.554
(WaruMozaemon roars)

00:17:31.587 --> 00:17:34.857
Grow stronger my sweet,
sweet WaruMonzaemon.

00:17:34.891 --> 00:17:38.127
I can't wait to see how strong
you get after eating them!

00:17:39.062 --> 00:17:40.063
Devour them!

00:17:41.798 --> 00:17:43.766
(Weregarurumon grunts)

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:45.601
Weregarurumon!

00:17:45.635 --> 00:17:47.537
-I'm...
-Huh?

00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:50.440
[TK] I'm gonna be
down here forever.

00:17:50.473 --> 00:17:51.607
What did you say?

00:17:51.641 --> 00:17:54.535
[TK] Stay here forever.

00:17:58.756 --> 00:17:59.757
TK!

00:18:01.592 --> 00:18:05.596
You gotta get out of
there, little bro!

00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:07.698
We promised didn't we?

00:18:07.732 --> 00:18:11.102
Remember what we said
about the carousel?

00:18:11.302 --> 00:18:15.373
Let's ride the carousel
together next time!

00:18:15.406 --> 00:18:16.874
Okay, okay.

00:18:16.908 --> 00:18:19.544
(gentle music)

00:18:19.577 --> 00:18:20.878
You promise?

00:18:20.912 --> 00:18:23.915
I promise. Just you wait, TK.

00:18:25.983 --> 00:18:28.453
Are you there? Talk to me!

00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:31.589
Big brother. I hear you.

00:18:31.622 --> 00:18:34.592
That's right, if I
give up I won't be able

00:18:34.625 --> 00:18:37.462
to remember all my precious
memories with Matt.

00:18:39.163 --> 00:18:42.066
So we can't lose hope. Not yet!

00:18:42.099 --> 00:18:46.571
Because I made a
promise, with my brother!

00:18:46.604 --> 00:18:49.407
(electronic whirring)

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:51.075
(balloon explodes)

00:18:51.108 --> 00:18:52.910
-No way!
-Incredible.

00:18:52.944 --> 00:18:56.347
That's right, we can't
give up. There's hope!

00:18:57.281 --> 00:18:58.749
[All] That's because...

00:18:58.783 --> 00:19:02.753
Hope is, the will
to never give up!

00:19:02.787 --> 00:19:05.756
(all yelling)

00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:08.326
(dramatic music)

00:19:08.359 --> 00:19:09.594
You guys!

00:19:09.627 --> 00:19:11.696
Patamon digivolve to...

00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:15.800
(singing in Japanese)

00:19:26.878 --> 00:19:27.879
Angemon!

00:19:32.717 --> 00:19:36.153
(WaruMonzaemon groaning)

00:19:41.726 --> 00:19:43.127
Weregarurumon!

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:44.161
Yeah!

00:19:44.729 --> 00:19:45.730
Hi Angemon!

00:19:47.064 --> 00:19:49.400
Wolf Claw!

00:19:51.502 --> 00:19:54.438
Hand of Fate!

00:20:01.546 --> 00:20:02.713
What?

00:20:02.747 --> 00:20:04.315
There you are Matt.

00:20:04.348 --> 00:20:06.217
You alright little bro?

00:20:06.250 --> 00:20:08.853
Urgh! How dare you!

00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:14.191
WaruMonzaemon, swallow all of
those brats once and for all!

00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:18.863
(blast rumbling)

00:20:19.931 --> 00:20:21.265
It's no use.

00:20:21.299 --> 00:20:23.701
Your attack is nothing
compared to the hope of TK

00:20:23.734 --> 00:20:26.771
and these young Digimon,
it flows within me.

00:20:28.239 --> 00:20:31.375
Because of their hope, my wings
can take flight once again!

00:20:32.276 --> 00:20:34.245
(footsteps stomping)

00:20:37.048 --> 00:20:42.053
(singing in Japanese)

00:20:45.957 --> 00:20:48.125
(groaning) Curse you!

00:20:49.794 --> 00:20:50.895
(Opossummon screams)

00:20:58.402 --> 00:21:00.371
I was able to find hope again,

00:21:00.404 --> 00:21:02.440
because you called
out to me big brother.

00:21:02.473 --> 00:21:03.941
(Matt chuckles)

00:21:03.975 --> 00:21:05.443

that everyone can enjoy!

00:21:19.957 --> 00:21:21.158
When that time comes,

00:21:22.326 --> 00:21:23.661
we'll ride the carousel.

00:21:25.262 --> 00:21:28.799
Okay, it's a deal! (giggles)

00:21:28.833 --> 00:21:31.636
Now, let's keep
looking for food.

00:21:31.669 --> 00:21:33.604
You know we can't go
back empty-handed.

00:21:33.638 --> 00:21:35.673
