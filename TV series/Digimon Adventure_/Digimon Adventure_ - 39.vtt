[Narrator] This is
the mysterious world

00:01:42.094 --> 00:01:43.829
where Digimon live.

00:01:43.863 --> 00:01:45.898
The Digital World.

00:01:45.931 --> 00:01:48.534
Tai Kamiya and the
other Digi-destined,

00:01:48.567 --> 00:01:50.569
alongside their partner Digimon,

00:01:50.603 --> 00:01:52.505
continue their quest to prevent

00:01:52.538 --> 00:01:54.573
the revival of Millenniummon,

00:01:54.607 --> 00:01:57.209
the bringer of destruction.

00:01:57.243 --> 00:02:00.079
And so, they journey
on toward the FAGA,

00:02:00.112 --> 00:02:01.747
the Sealed Grounds.

00:02:04.717 --> 00:02:09.188
The eight Digi-destined
have finally been reunited.

00:02:09.221 --> 00:02:12.525
Together, they've endured
fearsome sandstorms

00:02:12.558 --> 00:02:16.762
and swum the ocean's
depths, and now, at last,

00:02:16.796 --> 00:02:19.031
they've arrived at...

00:02:19.064 --> 00:02:20.699
Look! There it is!

00:02:20.733 --> 00:02:21.934
Up ahead!

00:02:21.967 --> 00:02:24.036
Oh, I'm glad to see
it's still there.

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:26.739
The haven for traveling Digimon.

00:02:27.606 --> 00:02:29.275
So it's like an oasis, huh?

00:02:29.308 --> 00:02:33.045
The perfect spot to take a
little break and rest up.

00:02:33.078 --> 00:02:35.114
'Cause we'll need to
be rested and ready

00:02:35.147 --> 00:02:36.916
for all of the battles ahead.

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:40.286
(Kari giggling)

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:44.223
[Izzy] I can sense quite
a bit of history here.

00:02:44.256 --> 00:02:47.092
It hasn't been
abandoned, has it?

00:02:47.993 --> 00:02:49.461
(Sora sniffing)

00:02:49.495 --> 00:02:51.130
I smell something.

00:02:51.163 --> 00:02:52.731
Yeah, something yummy!

00:02:52.765 --> 00:02:54.567
I want some, whatever it is!

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.268
Hey Mimi, can we go look?

00:02:56.302 --> 00:02:57.269
Yeah!

00:02:57.303 --> 00:02:59.138
I'm starving!

00:02:59.171 --> 00:03:00.139
Okay.

00:03:00.172 --> 00:03:01.574
But let's be careful, everyone!

00:03:01.607 --> 00:03:02.575
Come on, Joe.

00:03:02.608 --> 00:03:04.076
Don't you wanna go, too?

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:05.744
Yeah, okay.

00:03:05.778 --> 00:03:07.479
But are we sure it's safe?

00:03:07.513 --> 00:03:10.816
(birds chirping)

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:12.484
[Matt] Well, there
doesn't seem to be any

00:03:12.518 --> 00:03:13.986
danger around here
at the moment.

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:16.655
[Gatomon] Now we just need to
find a place for Komondomon.

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:18.657
(Komondomon barking)

00:03:18.691 --> 00:03:19.959
Whoa!

00:03:19.992 --> 00:03:22.828
(group gasping)

00:03:22.862 --> 00:03:25.965
(bright piano music)

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:40.846
Whoa.

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.114
This place is poppin'.

00:03:42.147 --> 00:03:44.450
Yeah, and not a scary
Digimon in sight.

00:03:44.483 --> 00:03:45.784
They all look so happy.

00:03:45.818 --> 00:03:46.785
Hey, wait!

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:47.786
Aren't those things...

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:48.821
Mimi!

00:03:49.488 --> 00:03:50.656
Hamburgers!

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:52.124
Those are the tasty things you

00:03:52.157 --> 00:03:54.693
told me about before, right?

00:03:54.727 --> 00:03:57.363
Why would they have food
from our world here?

00:03:57.396 --> 00:03:58.831
'Cause they're delicious.

00:03:58.864 --> 00:04:00.332
Have one, Sora.

00:04:00.366 --> 00:04:02.334
Are you sure we can
take these burgers?

00:04:02.368 --> 00:04:03.369
Sure!

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:06.672
As many as you want!

00:04:06.705 --> 00:04:07.673
Burgers!

00:04:07.706 --> 00:04:09.008
Burgers!

00:04:09.041 --> 00:04:12.211
Homemade hamburgers
handmade from scratch!

00:04:12.244 --> 00:04:14.980
(Burgermon giggling)

00:04:15.014 --> 00:04:16.382
And they're free?

00:04:16.415 --> 00:04:17.883
Whoa. You for real?

00:04:17.917 --> 00:04:18.884
[Burgermon] You betcha!

00:04:18.918 --> 00:04:20.386
Wow! Thanks a lot!

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:21.387
What's your name?

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:22.988
Burgermon!

00:04:23.022 --> 00:04:25.758
(birds chirping)

00:04:28.694 --> 00:04:30.896
(Tai humming)

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.731
That's a good burger!

00:04:32.765 --> 00:04:34.400
It's seriously tasty!

00:04:34.433 --> 00:04:36.568
-Oh yeah.
-I'll say!

00:04:36.602 --> 00:04:37.836
[Tai] Who would've
thought you could get

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.738
a burger like this
here, of all places?

00:04:39.772 --> 00:04:41.006
[Mimi] I know, right?

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.007
So good!

00:04:42.041 --> 00:04:43.409
You could sell these.

00:04:43.442 --> 00:04:47.012
Never thought I'd find
a place like this here.

00:04:47.046 --> 00:04:48.414
(Joe gasping)

00:04:48.447 --> 00:04:49.682
It's kind of like one of those

00:04:49.715 --> 00:04:51.850
rest stops you see
out on a road trip.

00:04:51.884 --> 00:04:53.018
What are those?

00:04:53.052 --> 00:04:54.887
You've never seen one?

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.356
My family always
travels by plane.

00:04:57.389 --> 00:04:59.224
[Sora] Really?
What's going on?

00:04:59.258 --> 00:05:00.225
-(Mimi gasping)
-(Sora gasping)

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:02.561
Why is it that no one's
eating the french fries?

00:05:02.594 --> 00:05:03.562
I'm eating 'em.

00:05:03.595 --> 00:05:04.763
Not you guys!

00:05:04.797 --> 00:05:07.266
I'm talking about all
these other Digimon!

00:05:07.299 --> 00:05:08.534
Look!

00:05:08.567 --> 00:05:11.704
They're leaving all
those fries untouched!

00:05:11.737 --> 00:05:13.272
Maybe it's just
that french fries

00:05:13.305 --> 00:05:15.207
aren't that popular
with Digimon.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.377
They are kind of
tricky to pick up.

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:20.379
That's the worst
reason I've ever heard!

00:05:20.412 --> 00:05:21.947
Without french
fries on the side,

00:05:21.981 --> 00:05:23.615
a hamburger is nothing!

00:05:23.649 --> 00:05:26.085
Everybody likes to eat fries!

00:05:27.486 --> 00:05:29.755
To not like french fries,

00:05:29.788 --> 00:05:31.790
you'd have to be insane!

00:05:33.459 --> 00:05:34.460
You done?

00:05:35.594 --> 00:05:38.230
So you've been to this
place before, Gatomon?

00:05:38.263 --> 00:05:41.767
Yes. Though it seems to
have aged a lot since then.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.235
But at least it's still here,

00:05:43.268 --> 00:05:45.738
which is good because
we certainly need...

00:05:45.771 --> 00:05:48.574
(group gasping)

00:05:48.607 --> 00:05:49.575
[Tentomon] What's going on?

00:05:49.608 --> 00:05:52.244
[Izzy] It's like a sandstorm!

00:05:52.277 --> 00:05:55.147
(Komondomon panting)

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:56.148
Oh no.

00:05:56.181 --> 00:05:57.216
What is it, Komondomon?

00:05:57.249 --> 00:05:59.084
Aw.
Are you itchy?

00:05:59.118 --> 00:06:01.820
(Komondomon barking)

00:06:01.854 --> 00:06:04.223
Komondomon's itchy
from the sand.

00:06:04.256 --> 00:06:05.924
Yeah, well, that's
gonna happen when you

00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:07.760
travel through
deserts and jungle.

00:06:07.793 --> 00:06:09.495
He does look pretty dirty.

00:06:09.528 --> 00:06:11.497
I guess Komondomon needs a bath.

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:13.432
I wonder if there's a...

00:06:13.465 --> 00:06:18.470
-(Komondomon groaning)
-(magical music)

00:06:19.838 --> 00:06:22.174
There's another Komondomon?

00:06:22.207 --> 00:06:25.344
(Komondomon barking)

00:06:28.814 --> 00:06:31.350
So our Komondomon's
not the only one.

00:06:31.383 --> 00:06:34.019
Looks like the other
Komondomon got a bath.

00:06:34.053 --> 00:06:36.021
Where are all the
bubbles coming from?

00:06:36.055 --> 00:06:37.489
Lop-ear Ripple!

00:06:40.492 --> 00:06:43.529
-(dreamy music)
-(group gasping)

00:06:43.562 --> 00:06:44.696
(Kari gasping)

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:47.366
They've all gotten
a bubble bath!

00:06:47.399 --> 00:06:49.802
Thank you all for waiting.

00:06:49.835 --> 00:06:51.470
My name is Lunamon.

00:06:51.503 --> 00:06:52.471
Don't worry.

00:06:52.504 --> 00:06:55.207
I'll make you sparkly clean!

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:56.875
No thanks.
I'm good.

00:06:56.909 --> 00:06:57.876
You think so?

00:06:57.910 --> 00:06:58.877
[Tentomon] I see.

00:06:58.911 --> 00:07:01.547
So this is how they get washed.

00:07:04.016 --> 00:07:05.150
Tankmon?

00:07:05.184 --> 00:07:07.886
(Tankmon growling)

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:08.887
Jeez.

00:07:08.921 --> 00:07:10.722
What a big sleepy head.

00:07:10.756 --> 00:07:12.691
[Izzy] There are
Tankmon here, too?

00:07:12.724 --> 00:07:14.226
[Gatomon] They're
Mercenary Digimon.

00:07:14.259 --> 00:07:16.537
This is how they relax
when they're not working.

00:07:23.177 --> 00:07:24.812
(Joe giggling) Yup.

00:07:24.845 --> 00:07:27.181
They're simply the best.

00:07:27.214 --> 00:07:29.783
There's no one who
doesn't just love 'em.

00:07:29.817 --> 00:07:32.319
(Joe humming)

00:07:32.352 --> 00:07:33.487
I mean it!

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.823
Fries are the
stars of fast food!

00:07:35.856 --> 00:07:37.491
[Gomamon] They are?

00:07:37.524 --> 00:07:39.660
You know, that reminds me.

00:07:39.693 --> 00:07:41.128
Sometimes after cram school,

00:07:41.161 --> 00:07:42.629
I'd sneak to the
burger shop without

00:07:42.663 --> 00:07:44.131
telling my parents.

00:07:44.164 --> 00:07:46.200
I'd spend my allowance
on a small order

00:07:46.233 --> 00:07:50.204
of fries and slowly savor
them, one at a time.

00:07:50.237 --> 00:07:53.373
(dreamy music)

00:07:53.407 --> 00:07:54.541
Good times.

00:07:54.575 --> 00:07:56.710
The only moments of peace
I had between exams.

00:07:56.743 --> 00:07:58.979
Then it was back to studying.

00:07:59.012 --> 00:08:01.181
Yup, just me and my fries.

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:06.487
(Joe gasping)

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:08.989
Thank you for
sharing your fries!

00:08:09.022 --> 00:08:11.859
(Potamon humming)

00:08:13.026 --> 00:08:15.896
Yummy in my tummy, potato.

00:08:15.929 --> 00:08:17.831
There you are, Potamon!

00:08:17.865 --> 00:08:18.866
Potamon?

00:08:20.901 --> 00:08:23.003
Look what I've got for you!

00:08:23.036 --> 00:08:24.905
Chow down, buddy!

00:08:24.938 --> 00:08:26.507
Talk about a bottomless pit!

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:28.041
Wow, impressive!

00:08:29.376 --> 00:08:31.111
Yum, yum, yum, yum!

00:08:32.446 --> 00:08:33.413
Hey there.

00:08:33.447 --> 00:08:35.082
So you like fries, huh?

00:08:35.115 --> 00:08:36.216
(Potamon burping)

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:37.885
(Joe yelling)

00:08:37.918 --> 00:08:39.386
(Joe giggling)

00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:42.055
Yeah. The only one
of us here who likes

00:08:42.089 --> 00:08:43.924
to eat fries is Potamon.

00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:45.926
Then we agree!

00:08:45.959 --> 00:08:47.594
So good, right?

00:08:47.628 --> 00:08:51.765
Nice and crispy on the
outside, and on the inside,

00:08:51.798 --> 00:08:53.400
so warm and succulent.

00:08:53.433 --> 00:08:56.370
It's like having
heaven in your mouth!

00:08:56.403 --> 00:08:58.805
They're absolutely brilliant!

00:09:00.073 --> 00:09:02.743
-Potato cheers!
-Potato cheers!

00:09:04.778 --> 00:09:06.613
-(Joe giggling)
-(Potamon giggling)

00:09:06.647 --> 00:09:08.448
I think they've become friends!

00:09:08.482 --> 00:09:10.751
Yup. Just a couple
of potato buddies.

00:09:10.784 --> 00:09:12.386
-We're potato buds!
-We're potato buds!

00:09:12.419 --> 00:09:15.289
-Potato buds, potato buds!
-Potato buds, potato buds!

00:09:15.322 --> 00:09:16.623
You too, Gomamon!

00:09:16.657 --> 00:09:17.658
Come on!

00:09:19.326 --> 00:09:20.394
You're right.

00:09:20.427 --> 00:09:21.562
It's delicious!

00:09:21.595 --> 00:09:24.131
Right? So you're a
potato bud too now!

00:09:24.164 --> 00:09:26.433
[Potamon] Potato
buds, potato buds!

00:09:26.466 --> 00:09:29.903
-Potato buds, potato buds!
-Potato buds, potato buds!

00:09:29.937 --> 00:09:31.471
Potamon.

00:09:31.505 --> 00:09:32.906
Huh?

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:33.941
I'm afraid

00:09:35.342 --> 00:09:38.445
today's the last
day we serve fries.

00:09:38.478 --> 00:09:41.081
-(Potamon gasping)
-(Joe gasping)

00:09:41.114 --> 00:09:42.649
No more fries, really?

00:09:42.683 --> 00:09:45.485
What made you decide to
take them off the menu?

00:09:45.519 --> 00:09:48.822
Well, it was a group decision.

00:09:48.855 --> 00:09:51.792
(Potamon growling)

00:09:56.997 --> 00:10:00.167
That's a lot of fries, buddy.

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:03.670
(Potamon whimpering)

00:10:03.704 --> 00:10:04.671
Wait.

00:10:04.705 --> 00:10:05.706
Hold on!

00:10:06.707 --> 00:10:09.843
(Potamon growling)

00:10:09.876 --> 00:10:12.646
I think Potamon
wants to be alone.

00:10:12.679 --> 00:10:13.847
Oh wow.

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:16.149
It means a lot to
you, doesn't it?

00:10:16.183 --> 00:10:18.986
(Potamon growling)

00:10:19.019 --> 00:10:20.020
Potamon.

00:10:21.655 --> 00:10:22.623
[Kari] Tai.

00:10:22.656 --> 00:10:24.358
Oh. Sup, Kari?

00:10:24.391 --> 00:10:25.859
Did something happen?

00:10:25.892 --> 00:10:28.128
Well, kind of, yeah.

00:10:28.161 --> 00:10:29.363
But wait.

00:10:29.396 --> 00:10:31.198
What's with the broom?

00:10:32.666 --> 00:10:34.034
Lop-ear Ripple!

00:10:35.569 --> 00:10:38.672
(Komondomon barking)

00:10:39.573 --> 00:10:42.175
(dreamy music)

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:01.495
Poor guy.

00:11:01.528 --> 00:11:04.498
(dreamy flute music)

00:11:04.531 --> 00:11:06.166
Aw, cheer up.

00:11:06.199 --> 00:11:07.567
(Joe sighing)

00:11:07.601 --> 00:11:09.536
Look what I got.

00:11:09.569 --> 00:11:10.604
Oh, thanks.

00:11:13.573 --> 00:11:15.409
[Gomamon] So good, right?

00:11:15.442 --> 00:11:16.843
That's more like it.

00:11:16.877 --> 00:11:18.345
Our leader shouldn't go around

00:11:18.378 --> 00:11:19.746
with a gloomy face.

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:22.115
[Gatomon] He's the leader?

00:11:24.117 --> 00:11:25.185
That hits the spot.

00:11:25.218 --> 00:11:26.753
Thanks buddy.

00:11:26.787 --> 00:11:29.523
You're right. I can't let
these things get me down.

00:11:29.556 --> 00:11:30.590
(Joe yelling)

00:11:30.624 --> 00:11:32.092
(thud)

00:11:32.125 --> 00:11:33.760
Joe! You okay?

00:11:33.794 --> 00:11:34.828
He beefed it.

00:11:34.861 --> 00:11:36.029
Who said I beefed it?

00:11:36.063 --> 00:11:37.364
I did not!

00:11:37.397 --> 00:11:38.365
Huh?

00:11:38.398 --> 00:11:40.100
How come that didn't hurt?

00:11:40.133 --> 00:11:41.535
Is he all right?

00:11:41.568 --> 00:11:42.636
Yes.

00:11:42.669 --> 00:11:45.572
Lunamon's bubbles are as
soft and fluffy as clouds.

00:11:45.605 --> 00:11:46.573
Hey, you're right!

00:11:46.606 --> 00:11:47.774
That's amazing!

00:11:47.808 --> 00:11:49.543
Discontinued.

00:11:49.576 --> 00:11:50.811
How could they?

00:11:52.312 --> 00:11:55.082
(Potamon crying)

00:11:59.152 --> 00:12:01.421
No more potato.

00:12:05.759 --> 00:12:07.160
Potato.

00:12:07.661 --> 00:12:08.662
Goodbye.

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:13.934
-(mysterious music)
-No way!

00:12:14.935 --> 00:12:15.936
Tato!

00:12:19.473 --> 00:12:20.640
What's that?

00:12:20.674 --> 00:12:22.909
I'm not sure, but
it's coming this way!

00:12:22.943 --> 00:12:24.811
It looks like...

00:12:24.845 --> 00:12:27.280
Something is digivolving.

00:12:27.314 --> 00:12:29.950
(suspenseful music)

00:12:29.983 --> 00:12:31.451
[Jagamon] Tato!

00:12:37.824 --> 00:12:40.360
Are those potatoes?

00:12:40.694 --> 00:12:42.963
(suspenseful music)

00:12:42.996 --> 00:12:44.364
[Jagamon] Tato!

00:12:49.035 --> 00:12:51.171
(suspenseful music)

00:12:51.204 --> 00:12:52.272
Heads up, you guys!

00:12:52.305 --> 00:12:53.507
(Agumon growling)

00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:57.310
(potatoes exploding)

00:12:57.344 --> 00:12:59.179
-(alarm ringing)
-(Izzy gasping)

00:12:59.212 --> 00:13:01.014
Komondomon, get away from it!

00:13:01.047 --> 00:13:03.350
(Komondomon barking)

00:13:03.383 --> 00:13:04.618
(potato exploding)

00:13:04.651 --> 00:13:05.619
(Tai yelling)

00:13:05.652 --> 00:13:07.788
Did that potato just explode?

00:13:07.821 --> 00:13:10.957
(Digimon yelling)

00:13:10.991 --> 00:13:12.192
Please stop it!

00:13:12.225 --> 00:13:15.128
You're disturbing
our peaceful oasis!

00:13:15.162 --> 00:13:17.297
[Tai] Watch out!

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:19.032
I think the burger
stand is closed.

00:13:19.065 --> 00:13:20.901
Talk about a pickle.

00:13:22.169 --> 00:13:25.172
(suspenseful music)

00:13:28.008 --> 00:13:30.010
(potato exploding)

00:13:30.043 --> 00:13:31.812
Step on it, Garurumon!

00:13:31.845 --> 00:13:33.480
[Garurumon] You got it!

00:13:33.513 --> 00:13:34.514
Tato!

00:13:35.248 --> 00:13:38.218
(potatoes exploding)

00:13:38.251 --> 00:13:41.021
Agumon, digivolve to!

00:13:41.054 --> 00:13:42.055
Greymon!

00:13:43.423 --> 00:13:44.891
(potato exploding)

00:13:44.925 --> 00:13:47.828
[Tai] Matt! Take all these
other Digimon to a safe place

00:13:47.861 --> 00:13:49.162
while you still can!

00:13:49.196 --> 00:13:50.197
I'm on it!

00:13:52.399 --> 00:13:53.567
(potato exploding)

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:57.370
(Garurumon growling)

00:13:57.404 --> 00:14:02.075
-(potatoes exploding)
-(intense orchestra music)

00:14:02.108 --> 00:14:05.212
[Birdramon] We're
flying together now!

00:14:05.245 --> 00:14:07.414
[Pegasusmon] Equus Beam!

00:14:08.882 --> 00:14:09.916
(Togemon growling)

00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:12.185
[Togemon] Needle Spray!

00:14:12.219 --> 00:14:14.588
(potatoes exploding)

00:14:14.621 --> 00:14:15.589
(Mimi yelling)

00:14:15.622 --> 00:14:16.923
It's raining potatoes!

00:14:16.957 --> 00:14:17.924
Gomamon!

00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:20.393
Gomamon digivolve to!

00:14:20.427 --> 00:14:22.095
[Ikkakumon] Ikkakumon!

00:14:22.128 --> 00:14:23.430
(Ikkakumon growling)

00:14:23.463 --> 00:14:24.698
[Izzy] Got it!

00:14:24.731 --> 00:14:27.100
That's Jagamon, an
Ultimate Digimon!

00:14:27.133 --> 00:14:28.702
Tato!

00:14:28.735 --> 00:14:31.104
Hot potato, incoming!

00:14:31.137 --> 00:14:33.640
(Joe yelling)

00:14:34.808 --> 00:14:36.576
(Jagamon gasping)

00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:37.577
No!

00:14:37.611 --> 00:14:39.212
My last french fries!

00:14:39.246 --> 00:14:42.382
-(suspenseful music)
-(Joe yelling)

00:14:42.415 --> 00:14:43.917
[Ikkakumon] Joe!

00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:45.452
Tato!

00:14:45.485 --> 00:14:47.921
(Joe yelling)

00:14:53.159 --> 00:14:54.461
[Joe] Huh?

00:14:54.494 --> 00:14:56.229
[Ikkakumon] The fries?

00:14:56.263 --> 00:14:57.289
[Tai] Huh?

00:15:01.526 --> 00:15:04.362
(Jagamon burping)

00:15:06.364 --> 00:15:07.332
Wait a sec.

00:15:07.365 --> 00:15:08.767
I know that belch.

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:10.502
[Ikkakumon] Joe, you all right?

00:15:10.535 --> 00:15:12.470
[Joe] That's Potamon!

00:15:12.504 --> 00:15:13.838
No doubt about it.

00:15:13.872 --> 00:15:17.509
Jagamon definitely
digivolved from Potamon!

00:15:18.376 --> 00:15:19.344
Little Potamon?

00:15:19.377 --> 00:15:20.946
The one at the diner?

00:15:20.979 --> 00:15:22.480
That's right.

00:15:22.514 --> 00:15:23.615
It's him for sure.

00:15:23.648 --> 00:15:25.317
My potato bud!

00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:29.020
[Ikkakumon] But why
did Potamon digivolve?

00:15:31.323 --> 00:15:32.824
[Joe] I think I know.

00:15:32.857 --> 00:15:34.693
[Ikkakumon] Huh?

00:15:34.726 --> 00:15:37.862
The sorrow he felt at not
being able to eat fries.

00:15:37.896 --> 00:15:41.366
That's what made Potamon
turn into what he is now.

00:15:41.399 --> 00:15:42.968
(Jagamon growling)

00:15:43.001 --> 00:15:44.302
Come on, everybody!

00:15:44.336 --> 00:15:45.870
Will you lend me a hand?

00:15:45.904 --> 00:15:48.406
Will you help me save Jagamon?

00:15:50.675 --> 00:15:51.743
Thanks, guys.

00:15:55.847 --> 00:15:57.882
(Jagamon chuckling evilly)

00:15:57.916 --> 00:15:59.551
Jagamon, it's me!

00:15:59.584 --> 00:16:01.653
Your old potato bud, Joe!

00:16:01.686 --> 00:16:03.822
Remember when we ate
french fries together?

00:16:03.855 --> 00:16:04.823
Tato!

00:16:04.856 --> 00:16:06.157
(Joe yelling)

00:16:06.191 --> 00:16:08.994
(intense orchestra music)

00:16:09.027 --> 00:16:11.563
(Joe whimpering)

00:16:11.596 --> 00:16:14.733
(Gatomon yelling)

00:16:14.766 --> 00:16:18.370
(intense orchestra music)

00:16:18.403 --> 00:16:19.571
[Tentomon] Oh, look at that.

00:16:19.604 --> 00:16:21.172
A potato ring.

00:16:21.206 --> 00:16:22.574
[Izzy] Their rotating force

00:16:22.607 --> 00:16:25.210
strengthens its
attacks and defenses!

00:16:25.243 --> 00:16:26.678
We can't just rush in.

00:16:26.711 --> 00:16:28.713
It's far too dangerous.

00:16:28.747 --> 00:16:29.848
All right!

00:16:29.881 --> 00:16:31.583
Then we've gotta stop that
potato ring from spinning!

00:16:31.616 --> 00:16:32.917
[Izzy] Here they come!

00:16:32.951 --> 00:16:35.253
-(Jagamon growling)
-(suspenseful music)

-It's slipping!
-It's slipping!

00:16:52.804 --> 00:16:54.105
[Mimi] Huh?

00:16:54.139 --> 00:16:55.573
It didn't explode!

00:16:55.607 --> 00:16:56.608
But why not?

00:17:00.478 --> 00:17:01.446
That's it!

00:17:01.479 --> 00:17:03.782
Lunamon's bubbles stopped it!

00:17:03.815 --> 00:17:04.783
You're right.

00:17:04.816 --> 00:17:06.284
We may be able to
neutralize that

00:17:06.317 --> 00:17:08.453
potato ring with
Lunamon's bubbles.

00:17:08.486 --> 00:17:10.555
Komondomon's completely
covered in them.

00:17:10.588 --> 00:17:13.625
If we blow they off onto
the ring all at once...

00:17:13.658 --> 00:17:15.960
Mimi, bring Komondomon here.

00:17:15.994 --> 00:17:16.961
[Mimi] Huh?

00:17:16.995 --> 00:17:18.463
Oh, okay.

00:17:18.496 --> 00:17:20.298
What is it?

00:17:20.331 --> 00:17:22.300
I have a plan.

00:17:22.333 --> 00:17:23.601
Follow my lead!

00:17:28.473 --> 00:17:31.643
[Ikkakumon] Ikkakumon,
digivolve to!

00:17:34.446 --> 00:17:36.114
[Zudomon] Zudomon!

00:17:38.516 --> 00:17:39.517
Tato!

00:17:43.455 --> 00:17:44.756
Ready Mimi?

00:17:44.789 --> 00:17:46.958
[Togemon] We're here
and ready for duty!

00:17:46.991 --> 00:17:50.128
[Mimi] So what do
you want us to do?

00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:53.965
Make use of the shockwaves

00:17:53.998 --> 00:17:56.334
created by my hammer!

00:17:56.367 --> 00:17:57.669
Exactly.

00:17:57.702 --> 00:17:58.837
Get Komondomon!

00:17:58.870 --> 00:18:01.206
Put him in front of Zudomon!

00:18:02.507 --> 00:18:03.775
(Jagamon growling)

00:18:03.808 --> 00:18:06.511
Are you sure you want this now?

00:18:07.479 --> 00:18:09.948
[Zudomon] Order up!

00:18:09.981 --> 00:18:11.382
[Jagamon] Tato!

00:18:13.651 --> 00:18:15.286
Careful, Zudomon!

00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:18.456
(Zudomon growling)

00:18:18.490 --> 00:18:20.024
You totally missed!

00:18:21.726 --> 00:18:23.294
Wait for it.

00:18:23.328 --> 00:18:26.331
(upbeat rock music)

00:18:28.066 --> 00:18:30.034
[Jagamon] Tato?

00:18:30.068 --> 00:18:31.369
It worked!

00:18:31.402 --> 00:18:32.370
[Greymon] Nice!

00:18:32.403 --> 00:18:33.371
Perfect!

00:18:33.404 --> 00:18:35.473
Now they won't explode.

00:18:35.507 --> 00:18:36.808
You ready?

00:18:36.841 --> 00:18:40.311
Hey Joe, Zudomon, let's
put my powers to use!

00:18:40.345 --> 00:18:43.314
(upbeat rock music)

00:18:43.348 --> 00:18:45.183

(upbeat rock music)

00:19:08.106 --> 00:19:09.941
[Zudomon] All right!

00:19:11.109 --> 00:19:14.245
Now then, put your heart
into that hammer, Joe.

00:19:14.279 --> 00:19:16.281
And let Jagamon feel it!

00:19:17.615 --> 00:19:18.616
Zudomon!

00:19:19.417 --> 00:19:22.420
(upbeat rock music)

00:19:24.956 --> 00:19:26.191
[Joe Voiceover]
Come on, Jagamon.

00:19:26.224 --> 00:19:29.360
Go back to being your
old fry-loving self.

00:19:29.394 --> 00:19:30.595
[Zudomon] Joe!

00:19:30.628 --> 00:19:31.629
Let's go!

00:19:33.131 --> 00:19:36.868
(Zudomon growling)

00:19:36.901 --> 00:19:39.037
(Joe yelling)

00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:40.071
Jagamon!

00:19:43.575 --> 00:19:46.578
(upbeat rock music)

00:19:49.314 --> 00:19:50.748
[Jagamon] Tato!

00:19:54.152 --> 00:19:57.288
(potatoes exploding)

00:19:57.322 --> 00:19:58.656
[Zudomon] Huh?

00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:04.295
[Joe] Jagamon?

00:20:04.329 --> 00:20:05.763
[Jagamon] Tato?

00:20:07.165 --> 00:20:10.301
You know me now, don't cha?

00:20:10.335 --> 00:20:13.171
(Jagamon humming)

00:20:14.806 --> 00:20:15.773
You're back!

00:20:15.807 --> 00:20:17.575
My potato bud!

00:20:17.609 --> 00:20:19.010
We did it, Joe.

00:20:21.679 --> 00:20:23.815
[Kari] Thank you, Angewomon.

00:20:23.848 --> 00:20:27.085
The Celestial Digimon
raised Zudomon's power.

00:20:27.118 --> 00:20:28.319
And on top of that,

00:20:28.353 --> 00:20:30.989
it also helped Joe level
up as a leader, too.

00:20:31.022 --> 00:20:32.991
They're all amazing.

00:20:33.024 --> 00:20:34.325
How interesting.

00:20:34.359 --> 00:20:35.960
Good thing you beefed it.

00:20:35.994 --> 00:20:38.162
Yeah, it was a real good
thing you beefed it, Joe.

00:20:38.196 --> 00:20:39.163
Enough!

00:20:39.197 --> 00:20:41.499
I didn't beef anything!

00:20:41.532 --> 00:20:43.434
So is Joe just the
oldest one of you

00:20:43.468 --> 00:20:44.769
or is he our leader?

00:20:44.802 --> 00:20:46.704
I would say he's both.

00:20:48.506 --> 00:20:49.474
[Birdramon] Good.

00:20:49.507 --> 00:20:51.843
They got through it somehow.

00:20:51.876 --> 00:20:54.479
[Sora] Man, there are
potatoes everywhere.

00:20:54.512 --> 00:20:56.948
We could make a ton
of potato salad.

00:20:56.981 --> 00:20:58.182
(Sora gasping)

00:20:58.216 --> 00:21:01.286
(dreamy music)

00:21:01.319 --> 00:21:03.354
We've got all
kinds of new potato

00:21:03.388 --> 00:21:04.856
dishes on the menu!

00:21:04.889 --> 00:21:05.890
We love 'em!

00:21:07.058 --> 00:21:10.094
We can thank Jagamon
for all the potatoes.

00:21:10.128 --> 00:21:11.796
I hope you'll always
treasure the time

00:21:11.829 --> 00:21:14.799
you spend with your fries,
just as I always have.

00:21:14.832 --> 00:21:15.833
Tato.

00:21:17.001 --> 00:21:18.836

wash up anytime you want.

00:21:23.074 --> 00:21:25.176
[Kari] Thank you, Lunamon.

00:21:25.209 --> 00:21:26.177
All right!

00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:27.645

all Patamon could tell me was,

00:23:01.172 --> 00:23:04.308
"I think those big ears must
give Lopmon a stiff neck."
