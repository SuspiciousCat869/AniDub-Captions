WEBVTT

00:00:11.513 --> 00:00:15.184
[Izzy] And now for the
Digimon Encyclopedia.

00:00:15.217 --> 00:00:16.185
Greymon!

00:00:16.218 --> 00:00:18.187
This Digimon evolves from Agumon

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.355
and has an armor-like
skin covering his head

00:00:20.389 --> 00:00:22.391
giving him that ready
for combat look!

00:00:24.326 --> 00:00:25.561
Now, let's check this out!

00:00:27.663 --> 00:00:29.364
It looks like something amazing

00:00:29.398 --> 00:00:32.000
is going to happen to this
powered-up Greymon today.

00:00:32.901 --> 00:00:34.169
Let's wait and see!

00:00:38.507 --> 00:00:41.343
Which Digimon will
it be next time?

[Narrator[ Ogremon challenged
Greymon to a rematch

00:02:14.653 --> 00:02:16.622
to regain his lost pride.

00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:21.126
However,

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:23.595
their fierce battle
came to an abrupt end

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:25.764
when a mysterious
Digimon appeared

00:02:25.797 --> 00:02:27.699
destroying everything
in its path.

00:02:33.138 --> 00:02:35.173
This newfound
enemy was a Digimon

00:02:35.207 --> 00:02:40.212
that surpassed the Champion
Stage: an Ultimate Digimon!

00:02:40.712 --> 00:02:42.347
(roars)

00:02:43.682 --> 00:02:46.318
Its destructive power
engulfed the children

00:02:46.351 --> 00:02:48.520
in flames of despair.

00:02:53.992 --> 00:02:56.862
(lightning sparks)

00:03:06.505 --> 00:03:09.241
(embers crackle)

00:03:10.342 --> 00:03:13.078
(birds chirping)

00:03:19.718 --> 00:03:23.155
[Joe] Get outta
here! Everybody, run!

00:03:23.188 --> 00:03:26.058
Oh gee! I'm afraid I have
to say this is no time

00:03:26.091 --> 00:03:27.726
to be filming, Izzy!

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:28.994
[Tai] Ogremon no!

00:03:29.027 --> 00:03:30.929
Sora, please look after Agumon!

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.333
[Matt] I hate to admit it,
but we have to retreat.

00:03:34.366 --> 00:03:36.201
(roars)

00:03:40.272 --> 00:03:42.908
[Gomamon] You're
gonna be fine, Agumon.

00:03:42.941 --> 00:03:46.678
The longer you rest down here,
the faster you'll recover,

00:03:46.712 --> 00:03:47.679
(Izzy gasps)

00:03:47.713 --> 00:03:48.880
[Izzy] This is it!

00:03:48.914 --> 00:03:51.049
Ultimate Digimon,
Metal Tyranomon.

00:03:52.217 --> 00:03:54.052
Where did you find
this info, Izzy?

00:03:54.086 --> 00:03:55.754
I was able to recover the data

00:03:55.787 --> 00:03:57.723
that was left behind
back at the fortress.

00:03:57.756 --> 00:03:59.591
[Joe] When did you
have time to do that?

00:03:59.624 --> 00:04:01.526
[Izzy] But most of
the data is corrupted

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.762
so it's difficult to analyze.

00:04:03.795 --> 00:04:05.697
[Sora] So, all you
figured out was its name?

00:04:05.731 --> 00:04:07.532
[Joe] Well, now we
know from experience

00:04:07.566 --> 00:04:11.069
that Ultimate Digimon are big,
scary, and extremely strong!

00:04:15.974 --> 00:04:19.878
Celestial Digimon, lies ahead.

00:04:24.816 --> 00:04:26.818
Go straight, child.

00:04:31.923 --> 00:04:33.458
[Matt] You do realize
that retreating

00:04:33.492 --> 00:04:36.061
was the best option
we had at the time.

00:04:36.094 --> 00:04:39.398
None of us stood a chance
against a Digimon like that.

00:04:39.431 --> 00:04:42.801
And if we die, everything
will end. Game over.

00:04:42.834 --> 00:04:44.736
I just wish we had
gotten more information

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.638
out of Ogremon while
we had the chance.

00:04:46.671 --> 00:04:48.640
That's not what that
fight was about.

00:04:49.975 --> 00:04:53.278
It was what Ogremon
said, a fight for pride.

00:04:54.346 --> 00:04:56.948
That's why Ogremon
challenged us to battle.

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:01.453
That's all it was about, not
about friends or enemies.

00:05:01.486 --> 00:05:05.190
We had our own reason,
and Ogremon had his.

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:12.330
(Mimi whimpers)

00:05:12.364 --> 00:05:14.466
Why has everything
gotten to stressful?

00:05:16.001 --> 00:05:18.470
This is tense.
Should I stop 'em?

00:05:19.971 --> 00:05:20.939
(whimpers)

00:05:20.972 --> 00:05:21.973
Please?

00:05:22.808 --> 00:05:24.509
(gasps)

00:05:24.543 --> 00:05:25.777
[Matt] Did you ever consider

00:05:25.811 --> 00:05:27.846
that Ogremon's words
could be a trap?

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:29.848
If you saw the
look in his eyes,

00:05:29.881 --> 00:05:31.850
you would know that
he wasn't lying.

00:05:31.883 --> 00:05:34.453
[Matt] Making friends
with adversary?

00:05:34.486 --> 00:05:36.188
Talk about being naive.

00:05:36.221 --> 00:05:39.157
You keep that up and
you won't survive.

00:05:42.727 --> 00:05:45.397
No. I'm gonna see
this mission through!

00:05:46.731 --> 00:05:50.168
I'll save the Celestial
Digimon and I'll save our city!

00:05:54.739 --> 00:05:56.842
(groans)

00:05:58.743 --> 00:06:00.178
Hello, Tai!

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.182
(laughs)

00:06:04.216 --> 00:06:05.650
Agumon!

00:06:05.684 --> 00:06:07.519
Nice to see you, too!

00:06:07.552 --> 00:06:08.720
I'm glad you're okay!

00:06:09.921 --> 00:06:12.891
(stomach growls)

00:06:12.924 --> 00:06:14.493
(all chuckle)

00:06:14.526 --> 00:06:17.162
(chuckles)

00:06:17.195 --> 00:06:18.897
Biyomon and the
others should be back

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:20.866
with food for ya soon!

00:06:20.899 --> 00:06:22.534
What about Ogremon?

00:06:30.041 --> 00:06:33.512
I just wanted to
finish our battle.

00:06:33.545 --> 00:06:34.546
I know.

00:06:36.448 --> 00:06:37.449
I did, too.

00:06:41.119 --> 00:06:43.722
(Agumon cries)

00:06:45.891 --> 00:06:48.760
[All] We're back, everyone!

00:06:48.793 --> 00:06:52.030
[Agumon] Look at all the
yummy snacks you guys got!

00:06:52.063 --> 00:06:54.933
(enthusiastic chuckle)

00:06:54.966 --> 00:06:56.201
[Palmon] There's
enough for everyone!

00:06:56.234 --> 00:06:58.603
[Gomamon] I'm just happy
you all made it back safely.

00:06:58.637 --> 00:07:00.071
[Tentomon] It was pretty tough!

00:07:00.105 --> 00:07:03.074
There were Soundbirdmon flying
all over the place out there.

00:07:07.112 --> 00:07:09.247
Well then, it's only
a matter of time

00:07:09.281 --> 00:07:10.982
before they find all of us here.

00:07:13.919 --> 00:07:15.921
(roars)

00:07:19.991 --> 00:07:21.660
[Matt] What are
you thinking, Tai?

00:07:23.328 --> 00:07:25.297
If you're trying to fight
them without a plan,

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:27.399
I can't go along with you.

00:07:27.432 --> 00:07:28.533
Remember,

00:07:28.567 --> 00:07:31.269
our primary goal is to
rescue the Celestial Digimon.

00:07:32.304 --> 00:07:33.738
Yeah, I know all of that.

00:07:33.772 --> 00:07:35.774
But we're running
out of time here

00:07:35.807 --> 00:07:37.909
and the enemy is
bound to find us

00:07:37.943 --> 00:07:39.978
if we just sit around and wait.

00:07:40.011 --> 00:07:41.646
Which means the
only way out of here

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.181
is through Metal Tyranomon.

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:47.118
Unfortunately, he's right.

00:07:47.152 --> 00:07:49.854
If Soundbirdmon sees us,
they'll alert Metal Tyranomon.

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:53.625
[Tentomon] You'll
never believe it!

00:07:53.658 --> 00:07:55.126
Come quick!

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.963
Izzy made a huge discovery
about the Celestial Digimon

00:07:57.996 --> 00:07:59.531
and how to find them!

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:05.070
(Digivice beeps)

00:08:05.103 --> 00:08:06.504
See? What did I tell ya?

00:08:06.538 --> 00:08:07.939
What is this?

00:08:07.973 --> 00:08:11.109
I found it while going through
the data. Check it out.

00:08:11.142 --> 00:08:14.012
This is a map of where we
are on the Cloud Continent.

00:08:14.045 --> 00:08:16.247
I'm sending it to all
of your Digivices now.

00:08:16.281 --> 00:08:19.651
(Digivices beeping)

00:08:19.684 --> 00:08:22.621
And also, I figured out
a couple more things.

00:08:22.654 --> 00:08:25.123
I may have answers to
some of your questions.

00:08:25.156 --> 00:08:28.526
For starters, here's the
seaside fortress where we're at.

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:29.761
From the looks of it,

00:08:29.794 --> 00:08:31.296
there seems to
have been frequent

00:08:31.329 --> 00:08:32.297
communication taking place

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:34.566
between the fortress
and another location.

00:08:36.167 --> 00:08:37.702
The words Tai read earlier

00:08:37.736 --> 00:08:40.505
were also found in
their communication log.

00:08:40.538 --> 00:08:42.307
Meaning there's a
strong possibility

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:44.142
that one of these
points could be--

00:08:44.175 --> 00:08:45.977
The enemy's headquarters.

00:08:46.011 --> 00:08:48.213
Where the Celestial
Digimon is now.

00:08:49.347 --> 00:08:50.348
Precisely.

00:08:50.382 --> 00:08:51.816
Which means we
should head toward

00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:54.219
one of these marked
locations next.

00:08:54.252 --> 00:08:57.889
But there's another piece of
evidence that narrows it down.

00:08:57.922 --> 00:09:01.026
This is the direction that
Ogremon pointed us toward.

00:09:01.059 --> 00:09:03.762
And if we overlap it
with the map like this.

00:09:06.097 --> 00:09:07.766
So that's what he meant.

00:09:09.034 --> 00:09:10.435
Go straight ahead.

00:09:12.904 --> 00:09:14.673
This means...

00:09:14.706 --> 00:09:16.908
Ogremon gave us
the exact location

00:09:16.941 --> 00:09:18.877
of the enemy headquarters.

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:20.245
Yup! Looks like
Ogremon's a hero.

00:09:20.278 --> 00:09:22.580
But you're the one
who figured it out!

00:09:22.614 --> 00:09:24.416
(all laugh)

00:09:24.449 --> 00:09:25.784
Thank you, Izzy!

00:09:28.586 --> 00:09:29.754
All right then,

00:09:29.788 --> 00:09:32.524
it seems like we can
trust his information.

00:09:32.557 --> 00:09:33.725
This time at least.

00:09:33.758 --> 00:09:34.726
(chuckles)

00:09:34.759 --> 00:09:35.727
Ready?

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:37.262
You betcha!

00:09:37.295 --> 00:09:38.363
Oh, and Tai.

00:09:38.396 --> 00:09:39.631
-Yeah?
-Check this out.

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:45.070
(Digivice beeps)

00:09:46.738 --> 00:09:48.740
(roars)

00:09:56.581 --> 00:09:58.917
(both pant)

00:10:01.619 --> 00:10:04.989
(mid-tempo action music)

00:10:07.258 --> 00:10:08.593
Pepper Breath!

00:10:17.302 --> 00:10:18.770
(Soundbirdmon beeps)

00:10:18.803 --> 00:10:20.972
[Tai] This is Tai, the
diversion plan is working.

00:10:21.005 --> 00:10:23.141
Now's your chance to
make a run for it.

00:10:23.174 --> 00:10:28.747
Once Agumon and I shake them
off, we'll catch up with you.

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:50.802
You think this is far enough?

00:10:50.835 --> 00:10:52.237
Mm-hmm!

00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:54.439
Thanks, Matt. I owe you one.

00:10:59.177 --> 00:11:01.913
(wings flapping)

00:11:01.946 --> 00:11:02.914
Ready?

00:11:02.947 --> 00:11:03.948
Oh, yeah!

00:11:04.783 --> 00:11:08.019
(upscale action music)

00:11:24.035 --> 00:11:25.870
Agumon digivolve to...

00:11:27.338 --> 00:11:32.343
(singing in Japanese)

00:11:40.018 --> 00:11:41.019
Greymon!

00:11:45.323 --> 00:11:46.457
(energy whirs)

00:11:46.491 --> 00:11:48.326
Let's give it to 'em!

00:11:48.359 --> 00:11:49.360
Yeah!

00:12:01.506 --> 00:12:03.842
(explosion)

00:12:07.579 --> 00:12:08.580
Nova Blast!

00:12:13.218 --> 00:12:14.652
We've got to get in closer!

00:12:14.686 --> 00:12:17.655
Got it!

00:12:17.689 --> 00:12:19.157
(Metal Tyranomon roars)

00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:24.095
It's you and me this time.
And I'm not gonna lose!

00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:28.366
(both gasp)

00:12:32.437 --> 00:12:34.873
(both grunt)

00:12:37.709 --> 00:12:39.611
(roars)

00:12:43.548 --> 00:12:46.851
(foliage rustles)

00:12:46.885 --> 00:12:49.687
(bubbling)

00:12:49.721 --> 00:12:52.056
(squelches)

00:12:53.124 --> 00:12:55.627
(eerie music)

00:12:57.962 --> 00:13:00.765
[Matt] How are we
supposed to cross this?

00:13:00.798 --> 00:13:03.067
So much for just
going straight ahead.

00:13:03.101 --> 00:13:04.402
(whimpers)

00:13:04.435 --> 00:13:07.572
Not only does it look
eerie, it feels evil.

00:13:07.605 --> 00:13:10.108
Yeah, very evil.

00:13:10.141 --> 00:13:11.442
(both whimper)

00:13:11.476 --> 00:13:13.444
We're supposed to
go through that?

00:13:13.478 --> 00:13:15.880
I don't think so!
Not gonna happen!

00:13:15.914 --> 00:13:18.449
Yuck! I'm not going
through that either!

00:13:18.483 --> 00:13:19.951
(ominous music)

00:13:19.984 --> 00:13:24.255
What is this dark mist? Or
should it be called a miasma?

00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:26.958
Oh, look!

00:13:26.991 --> 00:13:29.427
It's the same thing
Metal Tyranomon emitted!

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:30.461
Do you remember?

00:13:31.763 --> 00:13:34.065
You think that means he
walked through this stuff?

00:13:34.098 --> 00:13:36.234
I bet they go this
way all the time.

00:13:36.267 --> 00:13:37.502
This is their main route.

00:13:39.003 --> 00:13:39.971
(computer blaring)

00:13:40.004 --> 00:13:41.439
Huh? What's this?

00:13:41.472 --> 00:13:43.074
Yeah, on second thought

00:13:43.107 --> 00:13:45.310
maybe we shouldn't get
too close to that stuff.

00:13:45.343 --> 00:13:46.945
(all shudder)

00:13:46.978 --> 00:13:48.313
I have an idea!

00:13:48.346 --> 00:13:50.415
Let's find something
to throw inside of it,

00:13:50.448 --> 00:13:51.816
and see what happens.

00:13:51.849 --> 00:13:53.685
Well, if you say so!

00:13:55.019 --> 00:13:58.489
(book splashes)

00:13:58.523 --> 00:14:00.325
(all shudder)

00:14:00.358 --> 00:14:02.060
I know I swam across the sea,

00:14:02.093 --> 00:14:04.629
but this might be more
than I can handle.

00:14:04.662 --> 00:14:06.864
Hey! Was that my exam prep book?

00:14:09.867 --> 00:14:12.337
[Gabumon] It seems Ogremon's
information was correct.

00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:14.806
But this dark miasma
is far too dangerous

00:14:14.839 --> 00:14:16.174
for us to get across.

00:14:16.207 --> 00:14:17.709
Man, what a bummer.

00:14:19.877 --> 00:14:22.647
(miasma hissing)

00:14:24.515 --> 00:14:27.452
(energy whirs)

00:14:27.485 --> 00:14:30.388
(lightning sparks)

00:14:32.623 --> 00:14:34.025
[Izzy] Take a look
at the battle data

00:14:34.058 --> 00:14:35.893
I analyzed for Metal Tyranomon.

00:14:37.328 --> 00:14:40.198
When Metal Tyranomon switches
from lasers to missiles,

00:14:40.231 --> 00:14:42.400
there's a small opening
for a counterattack.

00:14:43.568 --> 00:14:45.536
Maybe you can somehow
take advantage of that.

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:48.039
It's the only weakness
of his I've found so far.

00:14:50.375 --> 00:14:52.877
(tense music)

00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:56.981
That's it!

00:14:57.015 --> 00:14:57.982
Now's our chance!

00:14:58.016 --> 00:14:59.017
I'm on it!

00:14:59.884 --> 00:15:00.885
Nova Blast

00:15:07.859 --> 00:15:08.893
(grunts)

00:15:08.926 --> 00:15:11.562
(energy whirs)

00:15:13.231 --> 00:15:15.366
(grunts)

00:15:19.103 --> 00:15:21.172
(groans)

00:15:21.205 --> 00:15:22.173
Huh?

00:15:22.206 --> 00:15:24.776
(energy whirs)

00:15:25.877 --> 00:15:29.580
(missiles explode)

00:15:29.614 --> 00:15:30.715
[All] Huh?

00:15:30.748 --> 00:15:33.551
What's going on?

00:15:37.563 --> 00:15:41.434
(rumbling in the distance)

00:15:41.467 --> 00:15:42.769
(upscale action music)

00:15:42.802 --> 00:15:45.405
Almost, just a little closer!

00:16:02.922 --> 00:16:04.123
There it is!

00:16:04.157 --> 00:16:06.959
I see it! We'll
get him this time!

00:16:06.993 --> 00:16:09.128
(grunts)

00:16:13.933 --> 00:16:16.402
(both grunt)

00:16:16.436 --> 00:16:18.304
We can't give up yet.

00:16:19.439 --> 00:16:22.141
I promise you that
we won't lose.

00:16:25.678 --> 00:16:28.414
(Digivice beeps)

00:16:28.448 --> 00:16:30.516
(growls)

00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:41.661
Huh?!

00:16:43.296 --> 00:16:45.331
(energy whirs)

00:16:45.364 --> 00:16:47.600
(yelps)

00:16:47.633 --> 00:16:50.036
(both scream)

00:16:54.707 --> 00:16:57.376
(missile roars)

00:16:58.811 --> 00:16:59.946
[Palmon] What's that?

00:16:59.979 --> 00:17:02.882
[Mimi] It looks
like something fell!

00:17:04.884 --> 00:17:06.986
That's Tai and Greymon!

00:17:08.654 --> 00:17:11.491
(ground rumbling)

00:17:14.827 --> 00:17:16.662
And Metal Tyranomon!

00:17:28.841 --> 00:17:31.177
(all cough)

00:17:34.547 --> 00:17:38.017
(upscale dramatic music)

00:17:40.353 --> 00:17:43.089
(Digivice beeps)

00:17:49.395 --> 00:17:51.764
(both shout)

00:17:59.605 --> 00:18:01.707
(growls)

00:18:09.749 --> 00:18:11.884
(growls)

00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:18.558
(grunts)

00:18:18.591 --> 00:18:21.260
We're not about to lose
after coming this far.

00:18:21.294 --> 00:18:24.530
We'll never back down
and we'll never give up!

00:18:24.564 --> 00:18:26.566
(beeps)

00:18:37.076 --> 00:18:38.878
(upscale action music)

00:18:38.911 --> 00:18:39.912
Greymon...

00:18:40.947 --> 00:18:42.148
digivolve to...

00:18:57.763 --> 00:18:58.931
Metal Greymon!

00:19:02.969 --> 00:19:04.403
(singing in Japanese)

00:19:04.437 --> 00:19:05.571
(gasps)

00:19:05.605 --> 00:19:08.240
Greymon was able
to digivolve again.

00:19:08.274 --> 00:19:09.675
Now he's an ultimate Digimon.

00:19:10.843 --> 00:19:13.112
[Matt] That's impossible.

00:19:28.794 --> 00:19:29.962
Trident Arm!

00:20:02.728 --> 00:20:05.464
(energy whirs)

00:20:05.498 --> 00:20:06.565
Let it rip.

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:08.534
Giga Storm!

00:20:20.846 --> 00:20:22.848
(roars)

00:20:29.355 --> 00:20:31.557
(all gasp)

00:20:43.936 --> 00:20:45.938
(pants)

00:20:47.606 --> 00:20:49.842
We did it, Tai. We beat him.

00:20:49.875 --> 00:20:53.746
Of course we did, and it was
all thanks to you, Agumon,

00:20:53.779 --> 00:20:57.216
I really hope Ogremon was
watching us back there.

00:20:58.117 --> 00:20:59.118
Yeah!

00:21:02.555 --> 00:21:05.257
[Matt] While Ogremon's
information was correct,

00:21:05.291 --> 00:21:07.526
our problem is still that mist.

00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:10.596
[Gabumon] Yet Metal Tyranomon
was fine falling into it.

00:21:10.629 --> 00:21:13.365
Must be that those who
possess the dark miasma

00:21:13.399 --> 00:21:15.868
are able to survive in
this kind of environment.

00:21:15.901 --> 00:21:18.738
I guess that means this
is as far as we can go.

00:21:18.771 --> 00:21:21.440
We'll just make a detour, right?

00:21:21.474 --> 00:21:23.242
[Izzy] Even if we wanted to...

00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:25.945
There's not enough
information available

00:21:25.978 --> 00:21:28.614
to tell which way we need to go.

00:21:28.647 --> 00:21:32.284
Then how about this? We split
up into two separate teams.

00:21:32.318 --> 00:21:34.086
Looks like we have
no other choice.

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:35.287
Matt, what do you think?

00:21:35.321 --> 00:21:36.722
Sounds like a plan.

00:21:36.756 --> 00:21:38.257
But hat do we do

00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:41.260
if both paths wind up leading
to a dead end or something?

00:21:41.293 --> 00:21:43.129
We can't afford
to consider that,

00:21:43.162 --> 00:21:45.297
given our current circumstances.

00:21:45.331 --> 00:21:48.300
Besides, if something
wipes out one of our teams

00:21:48.334 --> 00:21:50.136
the other one might
still survive.

00:21:50.169 --> 00:21:51.303
Huh!?

00:21:51.337 --> 00:21:53.806
What do you mean if
something wipes us out?!

00:21:53.839 --> 00:21:56.408
[Gomamon] You know,
something could be anything.

00:21:56.442 --> 00:21:57.510
(Joe whimpers)

00:21:57.543 --> 00:21:59.411
[Tentomon] So, how do we
decide who's on each team?

00:21:59.445 --> 00:22:00.746
[Biyomon] I didn't
even think about that.

00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:02.248
[Mimi] How about we draw names?

00:22:02.281 --> 00:22:04.650
Joe, let me borrow that
notebook of yours real quick

00:22:04.683 --> 00:22:05.818
so I can make them!

00:22:05.851 --> 00:22:08.454
[Joe] Hold on! You better
not throw this one away too!
