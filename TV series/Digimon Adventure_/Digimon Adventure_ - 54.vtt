[Narrator] Guided by the
power of the eight crests,

00:01:43.476 --> 00:01:45.411
a new chapter of
the Digi-Destined's

00:01:45.445 --> 00:01:48.314
great adventure had begun.

00:01:48.348 --> 00:01:50.617
Who knows what sort of
trials and tribulations

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.452
they'll need to
face in their fight

00:01:52.485 --> 00:01:54.988
against the Great Catastrophe.

00:01:57.357 --> 00:02:00.793
Tai's group had fought and
defeated ShogunGekomon,

00:02:00.827 --> 00:02:03.296
the ruler of the hot springs.

00:02:04.364 --> 00:02:07.600
(hammer thuds)

00:02:07.634 --> 00:02:09.502
After the battle had been won,

00:02:09.536 --> 00:02:11.938
Tai and Agumon parted
from Joe's group

00:02:11.971 --> 00:02:16.976
and continued on their journey,
guided by their Digivice.

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.612
As they reached their next goal,

00:02:19.646 --> 00:02:21.181
Tai and Agumon wondered

00:02:21.214 --> 00:02:25.985
what could possibly be lying
in wait for them there.

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:28.555

Hey, are you all right?

00:02:43.169 --> 00:02:44.170
Mm-hmm.

00:02:46.906 --> 00:02:49.509
Giromon, an Ultimate Digimon.

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.981
Well, my Digivice led us to a
nasty place, that's for sure!

00:02:55.014 --> 00:02:58.051
(Giromon snickers)

00:02:58.084 --> 00:03:00.153

(intense music)

00:03:23.776 --> 00:03:26.613
[Greymon] Greymon digivole to...

00:03:42.929 --> 00:03:44.130
Metalgreymon!

Who's that?

-Rebellimon.
-Huh?

00:04:49.329 --> 00:04:51.497
-Rebellimon.
-Rebellimon.

00:04:53.299 --> 00:04:58.271
Rebellimon the reckless,
Rebellimon who refused to die.

00:04:58.304 --> 00:05:00.807
(tense music)

00:05:02.675 --> 00:05:04.177
Rebellimon, huh.

00:05:10.516 --> 00:05:12.151

00:05:42.348 --> 00:05:44.717
So is that Digimon a
friend of yours, or what?

00:05:44.751 --> 00:05:46.719
(Cutemon whimpers)

00:05:46.753 --> 00:05:49.489

(MetalGreymon and
Rebellimon growling)

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:13.913
[Rebellimon] A new face,
where did you come from?

00:06:13.946 --> 00:06:17.417
(saw blades whirring)

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:20.219

(tire screeching)

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:26.292
No, Rebellimon, no!

00:06:28.227 --> 00:06:30.029
Watch out!

00:06:30.062 --> 00:06:32.265
(engine revving)

00:06:32.298 --> 00:06:35.435
Hey, come on, we're just
passing through, okay?

00:06:35.468 --> 00:06:37.737
You've got no
reason to fight us!

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:40.039
(tire screeching)

00:06:40.072 --> 00:06:41.641
Stop right there!

00:06:46.078 --> 00:06:49.715
[Rebellimon] I don't
need a reason to fight.

00:06:49.749 --> 00:06:50.783
MetalGreymon!

00:06:50.817 --> 00:06:53.986
(saw blades whirring)

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:00.993
(Rebellimon gasps)

00:07:02.261 --> 00:07:04.430
(blow thuds)

00:07:04.464 --> 00:07:07.300
(tire screeching)

00:07:09.836 --> 00:07:12.839
(Rebellimon groans)

00:07:16.142 --> 00:07:18.010
[Cutemon] Rebellimon!

00:07:19.779 --> 00:07:21.747
(tire screeching)

00:07:21.781 --> 00:07:23.483
(Cutemon shouts)

00:07:23.516 --> 00:07:26.652
-Hey!
-I'll only say this once...

00:07:26.686 --> 00:07:27.687
Huh?

00:07:29.489 --> 00:07:33.459
[Rebellimon] Stay away
from me, you got that?

00:07:34.961 --> 00:07:37.697
(engine revving)

00:07:40.132 --> 00:07:43.336
[Tai] Seems like
Rebellimon's got some issues.

00:07:43.369 --> 00:07:45.137
So, what's your name?

00:07:47.673 --> 00:07:48.774
[Cutemon] Cutemon.

00:07:58.067 --> 00:08:01.170
"I have to keep fighting
in order to live"?

00:08:01.204 --> 00:08:04.874
Yeah, those were
Rebellimon's exact words.

00:08:06.342 --> 00:08:09.712
That's why Rebellimon
came to a place like this,

00:08:09.745 --> 00:08:12.815
where there are
outlaws everywhere.

00:08:12.849 --> 00:08:14.417
[Agumon] Outlaws?

00:08:18.521 --> 00:08:22.191
[Cutemon] This used to be a
wasteland with nobody in it,

00:08:22.225 --> 00:08:24.227
But then it all changed.

00:08:26.529 --> 00:08:29.732
Lots of Digimon
started coming here.

00:08:29.765 --> 00:08:32.401
It seemed more comfortable
than the cave I lived in,

00:08:32.435 --> 00:08:34.403
so I moved here too.

00:08:34.437 --> 00:08:36.539
But then soon after that,

00:08:38.241 --> 00:08:41.544
a lot of scary Digimon
started coming here.

00:08:41.577 --> 00:08:45.748
They bullied the weaker
ones, and started turf wars.

00:08:45.781 --> 00:08:47.049
That was when...

00:08:50.253 --> 00:08:53.289
(Cutemon whimpering)

00:08:55.558 --> 00:08:58.794
[Rebellimon] Tell
me, are you strong?

00:09:00.897 --> 00:09:02.598
At first, I thought
that Rebellimon

00:09:02.632 --> 00:09:05.468
had come there to
save me, but no.

00:09:06.903 --> 00:09:09.572
(Giromon thuds)

00:09:11.073 --> 00:09:13.442
Oh, how can I ever
thank you for saving me-

00:09:13.476 --> 00:09:17.780
-(engine revving)
-(tire screeching)

00:09:17.813 --> 00:09:19.582
[Rebellimon] Beat it.

00:09:19.615 --> 00:09:21.117
Weaklings like you

00:09:24.086 --> 00:09:25.288
are a nuisance.

00:09:26.589 --> 00:09:28.891
(soft music)

00:09:28.925 --> 00:09:31.227
It seems like
Rebellimon has no memory

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.996
of anything at
all from the past.

00:09:35.998 --> 00:09:39.068
Not even the reason for
wanting to fight all the time,

00:09:39.101 --> 00:09:41.671
or for wanting to win so badly.

00:09:44.941 --> 00:09:48.477
(Boltmon growling)

00:09:48.511 --> 00:09:50.446
Rebellimon keeps on challenging

00:09:50.479 --> 00:09:53.783
powerful Digimon to do battle.

00:09:53.816 --> 00:09:55.651
(engine revving)

00:09:55.685 --> 00:09:59.488
-(tire screeching)
-(Rebellimon shouts)

00:09:59.522 --> 00:10:02.325
(Boltmon grunts)

00:10:03.359 --> 00:10:06.195
(explosion booms)

00:10:13.035 --> 00:10:17.673
And continues to fight even
after getting badly beaten.

00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:25.348
I worry about him, because
one day he might...

00:10:25.381 --> 00:10:27.350
You can't ignore him, can you?

00:10:27.383 --> 00:10:28.985
Hmm?

00:10:29.018 --> 00:10:30.519
What is it?

00:10:30.553 --> 00:10:33.456
Something has been bothering
me for a while about this,

00:10:33.489 --> 00:10:34.890
Rebellimon fella.

00:10:36.359 --> 00:10:38.961
I know what you mean, I'm
thinking the same thing.

00:10:38.995 --> 00:10:40.796
-(ground rumbling)
-(dishes clattering)

00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:41.998
What the heck was that?

00:10:42.031 --> 00:10:44.967
-(Boarmon screeching)
-(dramatic music)

00:10:45.001 --> 00:10:48.070
(saw blades whirring)

00:10:52.074 --> 00:10:54.744
(Boarmon roars)

00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:01.017
(hooves thudding)

00:11:03.419 --> 00:11:06.222
(Greymon growls)

00:11:07.423 --> 00:11:09.058
Nova Blast!

00:11:09.091 --> 00:11:11.927
(explosion booms)

00:11:14.096 --> 00:11:16.432
-You okay, Greymon?
-Yeah.

00:11:17.366 --> 00:11:19.735
(Boarmon roars)

00:11:19.769 --> 00:11:22.071
(Greymon growls)

00:11:22.104 --> 00:11:24.774

[Cutemon] Rebellimon!

(Greymon grunts)

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:48.631

00:12:18.594 --> 00:12:21.464
-Here comes the big one.
-Bring it on.

00:12:21.497 --> 00:12:23.632
(hooves thudding)

00:12:23.666 --> 00:12:25.334
A little bit more.

00:12:30.506 --> 00:12:32.408
Let's hit him!

00:12:32.441 --> 00:12:33.509
Nova Blast!

00:12:37.513 --> 00:12:40.316
(explosion booms)

00:12:49.859 --> 00:12:52.795
(Giromon groaning)

00:13:04.874 --> 00:13:07.676
(energy humming)

00:13:16.519 --> 00:13:19.355
-Whoa, my owie's gone!
-Amazing!

00:13:20.222 --> 00:13:21.991
What a cool power you got there!

00:13:22.024 --> 00:13:24.126
Thanks, Cutemon.

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:27.863
You two must have to
fight together a lot, huh?

00:13:27.897 --> 00:13:30.466
You make a really amazing team!

00:13:30.499 --> 00:13:33.802
(chuckles) It's
not just fighting.

00:13:33.836 --> 00:13:35.471
Tai and me do
everything together,

00:13:35.504 --> 00:13:38.374
we're together all the time!

00:13:38.407 --> 00:13:42.578
Isn't that right,
Tai? (chuckles)

00:13:43.913 --> 00:13:45.814
(saw blades whirring)

00:13:45.848 --> 00:13:48.150
So, Rebellimon, you
really don't know

00:13:48.184 --> 00:13:49.518
the reason why you're fighting?

00:13:49.552 --> 00:13:52.721
[Rebellimon] I
don't need a reason.

00:13:52.755 --> 00:13:54.423
-Is that so?
-Hmm?

00:13:56.692 --> 00:13:58.494
Well, like, uh,

00:13:58.527 --> 00:14:03.332
what if it was to protect
something important to you?

00:14:03.365 --> 00:14:04.567
[Rebellimon] Important?

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:07.403
[Tai] Yeah, like
Agumon and my friends.

00:14:07.436 --> 00:14:10.039
There's a lot to protect,
when you think about it.

00:14:10.072 --> 00:14:13.175
Now that I say it though
it's kinda hard to explain.

00:14:13.209 --> 00:14:14.910
When I know I've
gotta protect Tai,

00:14:14.944 --> 00:14:17.079
it gives me like a
ton of extra power!

00:14:17.112 --> 00:14:19.348
I can do anything!

00:14:19.381 --> 00:14:21.951
(Tai chuckles)

00:14:26.455 --> 00:14:27.923
(Cutemon gasps)

00:14:27.957 --> 00:14:29.191
What's the matter?

00:14:29.225 --> 00:14:30.559
Everyone, run!

00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:33.963
(axe thuds)

00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:43.973
(tense music)

00:14:46.942 --> 00:14:49.712
(Rebellimon growls)

00:14:49.745 --> 00:14:50.813
It's Boltmon!

00:14:51.814 --> 00:14:54.583
(dramatic music)

00:14:57.987 --> 00:14:59.388
What is it, Agumon!

00:14:59.421 --> 00:15:02.224
I get the feeling this
Digimon's super strong.

00:15:02.258 --> 00:15:03.259
Yeah.

00:15:05.494 --> 00:15:07.162
[Rebellimon] You
stay out of this!

00:15:09.265 --> 00:15:12.735
(tire screeching)

00:15:12.768 --> 00:15:15.571
(Rebellimon growls)

00:15:15.604 --> 00:15:18.340
(Boltmon grunts)

00:15:20.276 --> 00:15:22.845
(axe thudding)

00:15:28.183 --> 00:15:31.620
[Tai] Boltmon. (gasps)

00:15:32.855 --> 00:15:35.357
That's, that's a Mega Digimon!

00:15:36.191 --> 00:15:37.926
(Boltmon shouting)

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:40.796
-(electricity crackling)
-(Rebellimon groans)

00:15:40.829 --> 00:15:41.864
Rebellimon!

00:15:42.998 --> 00:15:45.701
(dramatic music)

00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:00.316
(blow thuds)

00:16:08.157 --> 00:16:11.060
(Rebellimon thuds)

00:16:17.866 --> 00:16:23.330
(saw blade clangs)

00:16:31.171 --> 00:16:32.906
(Tai grunts)

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:33.941
-Huh?
-Hmm?

00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:38.679
(Cutemon gasps)

00:16:41.448 --> 00:16:43.951
(soft music)

00:17:07.141 --> 00:17:10.627
(Cutemon gasps)

00:17:23.974 --> 00:17:26.677
(engine revving)

00:17:29.847 --> 00:17:32.716
(Rebellimon thuds)

00:17:39.723 --> 00:17:40.858
Rebellimon?

00:17:43.827 --> 00:17:45.796
[Rebellimon] Tell me something.

00:17:45.829 --> 00:17:47.564
-Huh?
-Why did you?

00:17:49.233 --> 00:17:51.368
Why did I save you?

00:17:51.401 --> 00:17:54.571
Why, why did my body
move to help you?

00:17:58.876 --> 00:18:00.310
Well, what if it was

00:18:00.344 --> 00:18:01.879
to protect something
important to you?

00:18:01.912 --> 00:18:03.714
When I know I've
gotta protect Tai,

00:18:03.747 --> 00:18:05.649
it gives me a ton
of extra power!

00:18:05.682 --> 00:18:07.151
I can do anything!

00:18:07.184 --> 00:18:09.586
(soft music)

00:18:13.056 --> 00:18:15.559
(Boltmon grunts)

00:18:15.592 --> 00:18:18.428
(tire screeching)

00:18:35.379 --> 00:18:38.081
(Cutemon shouts)

00:18:40.217 --> 00:18:42.953
(energy humming)

00:18:47.791 --> 00:18:49.593
(Rebellimon grumbles)

00:18:49.626 --> 00:18:52.462
(triumphant music)

00:19:04.274 --> 00:19:09.279
-(Boltmon gasps)
-(explosion booms)

00:19:10.447 --> 00:19:14.418
-(saw blade whirring)
-(Boltmon groaning)

00:19:22.759 --> 00:19:25.429
(Boltmon roars)

00:19:27.331 --> 00:19:30.100
(engine revving)

00:19:33.437 --> 00:19:36.340
(Rebellimon roars)

00:19:40.277 --> 00:19:42.646
(Boltmon roars)

00:19:42.679 --> 00:19:45.682
(Rebellimon shouts)

00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:52.956
(explosion booms)

00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:59.463
(Rebellimon panting)

00:20:02.332 --> 00:20:05.302
(Rebellimon roars)

00:20:12.542 --> 00:20:14.978
(soft music)

00:20:26.823 --> 00:20:29.826
[Tai] So, what are
you gonna do now?

00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:33.964
[Rebellimon] I'm just gonna
have to find someone stronger.

00:20:33.997 --> 00:20:36.833
[Agumon] What
about you, Cutemon?

00:20:39.503 --> 00:20:41.038
[Rebellimon] Hey.

00:20:42.372 --> 00:20:44.508
If you wanna ride, hop on.

00:20:47.244 --> 00:20:50.013
(Cutemon giggles)

00:20:55.385 --> 00:20:56.887
What about you two?

00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:58.855
We're going that way.

00:21:00.023 --> 00:21:02.092
Where are you two headed?

00:21:07.197 --> 00:21:09.032
[Rebellimon] Straight ahead.

00:21:09.066 --> 00:21:11.234
(Tai and Agumon gasp)

00:21:11.268 --> 00:21:14.571
(engine revving)

00:21:14.604 --> 00:21:17.441
(tire screeching)

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:25.916
[Tai] You hear that?

00:21:25.949 --> 00:21:27.551
Yeah, I heard it.

00:21:29.453 --> 00:21:31.021
You don't think?

00:21:31.054 --> 00:21:33.457

[Izzy] The Digimon Encyclopedia!

00:22:43.493 --> 00:22:46.263
Rebellimon, this outlaw Digimon,

00:22:46.296 --> 00:22:48.665
who digivolves by
intaking junk data,

00:22:48.698 --> 00:22:50.167
revs a high-powered engine

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:52.936
and races through
the Digital World.

00:22:52.969 --> 00:22:54.805
Now, let's check this out!

00:22:54.838 --> 00:22:56.273
That tall, stiff mohawk

00:22:56.306 --> 00:22:58.675
is Rebellimon's
unique characteristic.

00:22:58.708 --> 00:23:01.745
I wonder how long it
takes to style every day.

00:23:01.778 --> 00:23:03.447
I'd really like to
see Rebellimon's hair

00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:05.148
when it's down, too!

00:23:07.484 --> 00:23:10.687
Which Digimon will
it be next time?

00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:12.022
[Narrator] An ominous shadow

00:23:12.055 --> 00:23:14.324
looms over the Digimon School.

00:23:14.357 --> 00:23:17.994
Will Mimi be able to save the
school from being destroyed?
