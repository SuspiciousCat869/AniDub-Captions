[Narrator] Guided by the power

00:01:41.191 --> 00:01:42.692
of the eight crests,

00:01:42.734 --> 00:01:45.653
a new chapter of the
Digi-Destined's great adventure

00:01:45.695 --> 00:01:47.363
had begun.

00:01:47.405 --> 00:01:49.699
Who knows what trials
and tribulations

00:01:49.699 --> 00:01:50.867
they'll need to face

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.912
in their fight against
the Great Catastrophe.

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:59.751
(Digivice beeping)

00:02:01.377 --> 00:02:03.213
[Agumon] Hey, Tai?

00:02:04.088 --> 00:02:06.549
Are we there yet?

00:02:06.591 --> 00:02:08.718
[Tai] We're almost there.

00:02:08.718 --> 00:02:10.220
[Agumon] I'm tired.

00:02:10.261 --> 00:02:12.889
[Tai] I know, hang
in there, buddy.

00:02:12.931 --> 00:02:14.682
[Agumon] I'm hungry too.

00:02:14.724 --> 00:02:16.100
(Agumon's stomach growling)

00:02:19.062 --> 00:02:21.689
We're almost there, honest.

00:02:21.731 --> 00:02:24.275
(gentle music)

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.124
(Digimon exclaiming)

00:02:48.466 --> 00:02:51.052
[Fanbeemon] Got it, thanks.

00:02:51.094 --> 00:02:52.720
Boop. Boop.

00:02:52.762 --> 00:02:53.763
Boop.

00:02:55.265 --> 00:02:57.600
Hey, careful with that.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.227
Watch what you're
doing, will you?

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:00.561
Don't treat them so rough.

00:03:00.603 --> 00:03:02.730
Yeah, those crops
are very precious.

00:03:02.772 --> 00:03:04.440
[Fanbeemon] Sorry.

00:03:04.482 --> 00:03:06.776
We wanna wrap this
up before lunch,

00:03:06.776 --> 00:03:09.821
so work hard, but safety first.

00:03:10.947 --> 00:03:12.782
[Digimon] Safety first!

00:03:12.824 --> 00:03:15.243
(Pomumon laughing)

00:03:15.285 --> 00:03:17.620
Okay, just a few
more and we're done.

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:18.621
Yeah.

00:03:20.123 --> 00:03:22.959
[Tai] Working hard
or hardly working?

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:24.627
Hey, Biyomon!

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:25.628
What's up, Tai?

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:26.796
Hi, Agumon.

00:03:31.968 --> 00:03:34.137
[Junkmon] Please, help
yourselves, dig in.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.476
Don't mind if I do, thanks.

00:03:40.518 --> 00:03:42.937
Unbelievable, you grew
all of this yourselves

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:44.147
in those fields out there?

00:03:44.188 --> 00:03:46.941
We did, we look at them
as being gifts to us

00:03:46.983 --> 00:03:48.484
from the land.

00:03:48.484 --> 00:03:50.778
Sorry, let me introduce you.

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.322
This here is Neemon.

00:03:52.363 --> 00:03:54.657
He originally came from
the Cloud Continent.

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:57.660
And these are my
friends, Tai and Agumon.

00:03:57.702 --> 00:03:59.329
Nice to meet you.

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.331
Yeah, likewise, Neemon.

00:04:01.331 --> 00:04:02.790
Gotta say, I'm surprised to see

00:04:02.832 --> 00:04:04.625
so many familiar faces here.

00:04:04.667 --> 00:04:06.461
Oh, I transferred
here temporarily

00:04:06.502 --> 00:04:08.171
at Neemon's request.

00:04:08.212 --> 00:04:10.006
You know I love to work.

00:04:10.006 --> 00:04:11.466
We've been practicing a lot

00:04:11.507 --> 00:04:13.009
since the last time we met,

00:04:13.051 --> 00:04:15.803
we're able to fly
much better now.

00:04:15.845 --> 00:04:17.847
So we thought it was about time

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:20.016
we got out and saw
more of the world.

00:04:20.058 --> 00:04:22.310
Yeah, same with us.

00:04:22.352 --> 00:04:25.146
We have Sora to
thank for everything.

00:04:25.188 --> 00:04:28.024
(Digimon agreeing)

00:04:29.859 --> 00:04:31.486
Oh, by the way, what was it

00:04:31.527 --> 00:04:34.530
that made you guys choose
this place to grow crops in?

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.991
Well according to
legend, long, long ago,

00:04:37.033 --> 00:04:39.369
thee lands were watched
over and protected

00:04:39.369 --> 00:04:42.163
by a very kind and
benevolent Digimon.

00:04:42.205 --> 00:04:44.332
Oh well, that
sounds just lovely.

00:04:44.374 --> 00:04:47.210
We came here hoping that
some of that ancient power

00:04:47.251 --> 00:04:49.879
might still reside in this land.

00:04:49.921 --> 00:04:52.882
This world, which has
long been such a troubling

00:04:52.924 --> 00:04:56.719
and dangerous place
is finally at peace.

00:04:58.054 --> 00:05:01.224
So now we're joining hands
with all the Digimon we've met

00:05:01.224 --> 00:05:03.226
and bringing everyone together

00:05:03.267 --> 00:05:06.229
in order to revive
these wastelands.

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.232
Eventually, we hope to
make this a welcoming town

00:05:09.273 --> 00:05:11.234
for all to come and settle in.

00:05:11.234 --> 00:05:14.070
Like a Digimon village, huh?

00:05:14.112 --> 00:05:16.406
That's right, and we're
helping them do it.

00:05:17.281 --> 00:05:19.409
We were just following
where the arrow led us

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:20.701
and we ended up here

00:05:20.743 --> 00:05:22.620
and it became quite the reunion.

00:05:23.788 --> 00:05:26.916
So we thought, why not stop
and help them out for a while?

00:05:26.916 --> 00:05:30.586
We Digi-Destined aren't
just here to fight, right?

00:05:30.628 --> 00:05:32.922
Yeah, you're right.

00:05:32.964 --> 00:05:34.757
In fact, we can help out too.

00:05:34.757 --> 00:05:36.259
What do you say, Agumon?

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:37.593
That's right.

00:05:37.593 --> 00:05:39.387
We could certainly
use your help.

00:05:39.429 --> 00:05:40.888
Yeah, as a matter of fact,

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:42.640
I got the perfect job for yous.

00:05:45.643 --> 00:05:47.103
[Pomumon] Heave, heave!

00:05:47.145 --> 00:05:50.398
There's this enormous
old useless tree stump

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:53.568
taking up space right in
the middle of the land.

00:05:53.609 --> 00:05:56.446
If we could just pull
it up and get rid of it,

00:05:56.487 --> 00:05:59.949
we'd have plenty of room
to expand our village.

00:05:59.991 --> 00:06:03.244
[Greymon And Tai]
Heave and heave!

00:06:03.286 --> 00:06:05.288
[Digimon] Heave, heave!

00:06:08.332 --> 00:06:10.460
Heave, heave!

00:06:12.128 --> 00:06:15.006
(Digimon groaning)

00:06:17.508 --> 00:06:20.344
[Junkmon] That's it, pull, pull!

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:28.811
It moved.

00:06:29.854 --> 00:06:32.315
Come on, just a little
bit more, Birdramon.

00:06:32.315 --> 00:06:35.943
[Birdramon] Okay!

00:06:35.985 --> 00:06:38.321
Keep it up, heave ho!

00:06:38.362 --> 00:06:40.490
[Digimon] Heave, heave!

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.038
(Digimon groaning)

00:06:49.499 --> 00:06:52.126
That a way, keep going.

00:06:52.168 --> 00:06:53.169
You got it.

00:06:54.712 --> 00:06:57.215
(stump thuds)

00:06:59.509 --> 00:07:01.344
-Oh yeah.
-All right!

00:07:03.179 --> 00:07:06.349
Now we can make a bigger
field and plant more crops.

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:13.010
Before you can do that though

00:07:13.052 --> 00:07:16.180
we're gonna have to do
something about this big hole.

00:07:16.222 --> 00:07:17.223
[Greymon] Yeah.

00:07:20.393 --> 00:07:21.769
Did you see that?

00:07:30.736 --> 00:07:31.904
What's happening?

00:07:31.946 --> 00:07:32.905
[Junkmon] Evacuate!

00:07:32.947 --> 00:07:35.032
Evacuate the area, safety first!

00:07:35.074 --> 00:07:38.119
(Digimon exclaiming)

00:07:39.578 --> 00:07:41.914
What could that have been?

00:07:46.085 --> 00:07:48.921
-(dramatic music)
-(ground rumbling)

00:07:48.963 --> 00:07:50.923
[Birdramon] We're
about to find out.

00:07:53.759 --> 00:07:56.595
(Digimon gasping)

00:08:17.658 --> 00:08:19.660
That thing is massive.

00:08:32.465 --> 00:08:35.259
Could this be the kind of
benevolent guardian Digimon

00:08:35.301 --> 00:08:37.011
who once watched over this land?

00:08:42.975 --> 00:08:45.811
(Digimon gasping)

00:08:53.152 --> 00:08:55.988
(lasers whirring)

00:08:57.865 --> 00:08:59.492
What's it doing?

00:08:59.533 --> 00:09:00.826
That sure don't seem

00:09:00.868 --> 00:09:03.537
like a kind and
benevolent Digimon to me.

00:09:05.498 --> 00:09:08.334
(lasers whirring)

00:09:14.507 --> 00:09:17.218
(dramatic music)

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:23.849
No, why would it attack
our precious village?

00:09:23.891 --> 00:09:26.185
Everyone, evacuate the
area, safety first!

00:09:33.901 --> 00:09:38.364
It's almost like the Digimon
is fighting something.

00:09:40.032 --> 00:09:42.576
At this rate, the village
will be destroyed.

00:09:43.869 --> 00:09:45.996
We have to stop it.

00:09:46.038 --> 00:09:47.039
Yeah.

Do not destroy the
village any further.

00:10:27.121 --> 00:10:29.206
[Tai] Seems like
we're being ignored,

00:10:29.248 --> 00:10:31.375
or maybe it's just
that they can't hear us

00:10:31.417 --> 00:10:32.626
with all this commotion.

00:10:33.794 --> 00:10:34.795
Hey, stop!

00:10:39.592 --> 00:10:40.593
I said stop!

00:10:50.811 --> 00:10:53.105
Is someone crying?

00:10:53.105 --> 00:10:54.273
[Tai] What was that?

00:10:54.273 --> 00:10:55.983
[Sora] Did you
hear that just now?

00:11:02.781 --> 00:11:07.620
Trident Arm!

Well, we're just
getting started.

00:11:37.149 --> 00:11:38.525
What made it stop?

some ancient ruins

00:11:54.708 --> 00:11:56.794
down there at the
bottom of the hole.

00:11:56.835 --> 00:11:58.128
We found them.

00:11:58.170 --> 00:12:01.006
What sort of Digimon is that?

00:12:01.048 --> 00:12:04.301
Why did it move and then stop?

00:12:04.343 --> 00:12:07.012
And what will make it
start to move again?

00:12:07.888 --> 00:12:09.139
Whatever is down there,

00:12:09.181 --> 00:12:11.517
I hope it can provide
us with some clues.

00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:22.695
Look at this.

00:12:30.077 --> 00:12:31.995
"With our solemn prayer,

00:12:32.037 --> 00:12:35.332
"we seal within this
land a great power.

00:12:35.374 --> 00:12:37.042
"A power that can penetrate evil

00:12:37.084 --> 00:12:39.044
"and reduce it to ashes.

00:12:39.086 --> 00:12:42.548
"This guardian, the one who
protects this land from darkness

00:12:42.589 --> 00:12:44.717
"is called Shakkuomon."

00:12:47.261 --> 00:12:48.887
Does that mean
that thing is-

00:12:48.929 --> 00:12:52.558
The kind and benevolent
Digimon from the old legend?

00:12:52.599 --> 00:12:55.060
Oh please, don't be ridiculous.

00:12:55.102 --> 00:12:57.563
There is absolutely
nothing kind of benevolent

00:12:57.604 --> 00:12:59.732
about that horrible
thing up there.

00:12:59.732 --> 00:13:01.859
If that's a kind and
benevolent Digimon,

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:04.945
I'd had to see what an unkind
and malevolent one looks like.

00:13:06.113 --> 00:13:07.948
[Biyomon] What is it, Sora?

00:13:09.742 --> 00:13:10.951
Isn't that...

00:13:12.953 --> 00:13:17.541
Hey, Biyomon, when we
touched Shakkoumon earlier,

00:13:17.583 --> 00:13:19.585
you heard something
too, didn't you?

00:13:19.585 --> 00:13:24.089
Yeah, I heard the sound
of someone crying.

00:13:31.597 --> 00:13:34.433
(Sora shuddering)

00:13:37.811 --> 00:13:39.772
Sora, what's wrong?

00:13:39.813 --> 00:13:42.441
(gentle music)

00:13:52.326 --> 00:13:56.121
[Sora] Our dear guardian
deity, Shakkoumon,

00:13:57.289 --> 00:13:58.999
please rest in peace.

00:14:06.507 --> 00:14:08.300
Sora, Biyomon, are you okay?

00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:10.636
[Neemon] Quickly, get
them up to the surface

00:14:10.677 --> 00:14:11.970
so we can treat them.

00:14:33.308 --> 00:14:34.434
Get ready.

00:14:34.434 --> 00:14:35.602
[MetalGreymon] Oh boy.

00:14:36.478 --> 00:14:39.272
(dramatic music)

00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:46.446
(lasers whirring)

00:14:46.488 --> 00:14:47.614
(Digimon exclaiming)

00:14:47.655 --> 00:14:49.616
So much for benevolence.

00:14:50.825 --> 00:14:52.243
(dramatic music)

00:14:52.285 --> 00:14:55.830
[MetalGreymon]
MetalGreymon digivolve to-

00:15:05.965 --> 00:15:10.136
[WarGreymon] WarGreymon!

00:15:18.311 --> 00:15:21.523
You will not destroy
anymore of that village!

00:15:22.816 --> 00:15:25.485
(discs whirring)

00:15:30.532 --> 00:15:31.533
Stop!

00:15:51.219 --> 00:15:54.889
[Neemon] Calm your
soul, go back to sleep!

00:15:58.685 --> 00:16:02.021
Return to your slumber,
guardian Digimon.

00:16:02.021 --> 00:16:07.026
Calm your soul, be at peace,
and leave us in peace.

00:16:08.695 --> 00:16:13.199
[Kyupimon] Shakkoumon,
you have worked so hard

00:16:13.241 --> 00:16:14.534
to protect us.

00:16:15.743 --> 00:16:17.078
And to protect this land.

00:16:19.539 --> 00:16:22.584
But now, you can not
protect us any longer.

00:16:25.587 --> 00:16:30.592
We will soon parish, and you,
you will no longer be hurt,

00:16:31.926 --> 00:16:32.927
not anymore.

00:16:35.889 --> 00:16:39.726
To protect you, our
gift from Heaven,

00:16:39.726 --> 00:16:43.062
we will seal you
here in this land

00:16:43.104 --> 00:16:45.106
that you have protected.

00:16:51.905 --> 00:16:54.699
Until the day you awaken,

00:16:54.741 --> 00:16:58.077
we pray that this
world will find peace.

00:17:11.466 --> 00:17:13.593
Thank you for everything.

00:17:20.934 --> 00:17:21.935
Goodbye.

00:17:33.112 --> 00:17:34.447
What was that?

00:17:39.452 --> 00:17:42.288
(lasers whirring)

00:17:53.508 --> 00:17:56.260
Calm your soul and
return to your slumber,

00:17:56.302 --> 00:17:59.263
oh kindest and most
benevolent guardian

00:17:59.305 --> 00:18:02.767
who brings destruction
and chaos to our land.

00:18:02.809 --> 00:18:04.644
Well, Biyomon?

00:18:04.686 --> 00:18:06.854
Ready, Sora, let's do it.

00:18:07.855 --> 00:18:08.982
[WarGreymon] Terra Force!

00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:16.823
(Garudamon exclaims)

00:18:21.661 --> 00:18:22.662
Garudamon!

00:18:26.874 --> 00:18:29.002
Why, Shakkoumon?

00:18:29.043 --> 00:18:32.171
[Garudamon] We will stop
Shakkoumon, we have to.

00:18:33.673 --> 00:18:36.843
Right now having
just been reawakened,

00:18:36.843 --> 00:18:39.679
Shakkoumon thinks the
battle going on long ago

00:18:39.679 --> 00:18:42.015
to protect this land
is still going on.

00:18:42.056 --> 00:18:43.057
[WarGreymon] What?

00:18:44.517 --> 00:18:48.021
[Garudamon] Shakkoumon,
that battle is long over.

00:18:48.062 --> 00:18:50.356
This isn't what
the Kyupimon wanted

00:18:50.398 --> 00:18:52.900
when they sacrificed
themselves to protect you!

00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:59.032
I promise you that we'll
make you the guardian deity

00:18:59.073 --> 00:19:01.367
of this land once
again if you'll let us.

00:19:03.703 --> 00:19:06.039
(Digivice beeping)

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:09.208
[Garudamon] Garudamon
digivolve to-

00:19:18.718 --> 00:19:20.887
[Phoenixmon] Phoenixmon!

00:19:25.266 --> 00:19:26.934
Starlight Explosion!

00:19:28.102 --> 00:19:30.730
(gentle music)

00:19:35.401 --> 00:19:38.529
(Digimon exclaiming)

00:19:38.571 --> 00:19:40.114
What is all this?

00:19:40.239 --> 00:19:41.616
Shakkoumon.

00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:46.245
our gift from heaven.

00:20:05.807 --> 00:20:08.935
(Shakkoumon weeping)

00:20:21.989 --> 00:20:23.116
Is it over?

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:36.587
Sora's right, the
Digi-Destined are here

00:20:36.629 --> 00:20:38.464
to do more than just fight.

00:20:47.181 --> 00:20:49.976
[Pomumon] Do you
really have to leave?

00:20:50.017 --> 00:20:51.144
[Sora] Yeah.

00:20:51.185 --> 00:20:53.980
[Fanbeemon] Please
don't go, Sora, please.

00:20:54.021 --> 00:20:56.983
We want you to stay here
with us forever and ever.

00:20:57.024 --> 00:20:58.693
I'll miss you too.

00:20:59.986 --> 00:21:02.488
At first I wasn't sure
why this led us here,

00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:05.116
but I think maybe
our real purpose

00:21:05.158 --> 00:21:07.034
was to be reunited
with all of you.

00:21:08.703 --> 00:21:10.621
In fact, I'm sure of it.

00:21:10.663 --> 00:21:11.664
[Pomumon] Really?

00:21:12.665 --> 00:21:15.668
I love you all and
want to protect you

00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:20.673
and that's why we'll stop
the Great Catastrophe.

00:21:20.673 --> 00:21:21.674
Won't we?

00:21:22.675 --> 00:21:24.510
Well, when you put it that way.

00:21:24.552 --> 00:21:27.346
We'll stay here and
work really hard

00:21:27.346 --> 00:21:29.515
for you and the others.

00:21:29.557 --> 00:21:31.517
Just do your best, everyone.

[Izzy] The Digimon Encyclopedia.

00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:46.926
Shakkoumon, this
Digimon first appeared

00:22:46.926 --> 00:22:48.761
in the ancient Digital World.

00:22:48.761 --> 00:22:51.264
Normally gentle, Shakkoumon
shoots outs laser beams

00:22:51.305 --> 00:22:52.306
when angered.

00:22:53.099 --> 00:22:54.767
Now let's check this out.

00:22:54.809 --> 00:22:57.103
That silhouette, I
feel like I've seen it

00:22:57.144 --> 00:22:58.396
in my textbook.

00:22:58.437 --> 00:23:00.106
Actually, when you
think about it,

00:23:00.147 --> 00:23:02.066
it seems like there
are a lot of Digimon

00:23:02.108 --> 00:23:03.401
who are normally gentle,

00:23:03.442 --> 00:23:04.652
but lethal when angered.

00:23:07.446 --> 00:23:09.949

it be next time?
