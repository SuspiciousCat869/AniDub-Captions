[Narrator] The
Digi-Destined's long quest

00:01:42.913 --> 00:01:46.449
to solve the mystery
of the crests was over.

00:01:46.483 --> 00:01:48.752
The answer was the quest itself,

00:01:48.785 --> 00:01:50.754
the whole adventure
they'd experienced

00:01:50.787 --> 00:01:52.789
up till this moment.

00:01:52.822 --> 00:01:55.292
And now, the Great
Catastrophe has

00:01:55.325 --> 00:01:57.427
finally begun to unfold.

00:01:59.596 --> 00:02:04.601
-(mysterious music)
-(bright violin music)

00:02:05.302 --> 00:02:07.137
[Wisemon] A white void.

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.139
Devimon said in our dream...

00:02:09.172 --> 00:02:11.141
That all will vanish.

00:02:12.008 --> 00:02:13.577
(group gasping)

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:14.945
The Digivices!

00:02:16.446 --> 00:02:17.514
What's going on?

00:02:19.015 --> 00:02:22.185
(ominous flute music)

00:02:23.687 --> 00:02:25.655
Never seen this function before.

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:26.656
Whoa!

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:27.657
[Tentomon] Hey!

00:02:27.691 --> 00:02:29.292
Isn't that the canyon maze?

00:02:29.326 --> 00:02:32.796
A lot of these places
look really familiar.

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:34.097
Like right up there!

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:35.999
Those are the hot springs!

00:02:36.032 --> 00:02:37.000
[Leomon] Children.

00:02:37.033 --> 00:02:38.034
Huh?

00:02:40.503 --> 00:02:42.105
Leomon!

00:02:42.138 --> 00:02:43.373
What is all this?

00:02:44.608 --> 00:02:46.009
This footage of all of you

00:02:46.042 --> 00:02:48.511
suddenly appeared
before my eyes,

00:02:48.545 --> 00:02:49.980
but more importantly,

00:02:51.381 --> 00:02:55.485
it seems the world is
falling into a white void.

00:02:55.518 --> 00:02:56.486
(Agumon gasping)

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.121
Same thing's happening here!

00:02:58.154 --> 00:02:59.122
Kari?

00:02:59.155 --> 00:03:00.457
Kari, is that you?

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:01.858
Muchomon!

00:03:01.891 --> 00:03:04.794
Oh, Kari, we're in big trouble!

00:03:04.828 --> 00:03:07.364
Just take a look at the forest!

00:03:07.397 --> 00:03:09.032
-(Kari gasping)
-(Gatomon gasping)

00:03:09.065 --> 00:03:11.701
You can see that it's
happening everywhere!

00:03:11.735 --> 00:03:14.804
I hope Tanemon and Golemon
and the others are okay.

00:03:14.838 --> 00:03:16.640
This all began to happen moments

00:03:16.673 --> 00:03:19.209
after the Soundbirdmon
were defeated.

00:03:19.242 --> 00:03:20.210
It's Lopmon!

00:03:20.243 --> 00:03:21.211
-(TK gasping)
-(Patamon gasping)

00:03:21.244 --> 00:03:23.013
And Xiaomon!

00:03:23.046 --> 00:03:25.548
I knew that was you, TK!

00:03:25.582 --> 00:03:27.484
I've heard so many
things about you,

00:03:27.517 --> 00:03:29.052
and here you are.

00:03:29.085 --> 00:03:30.053
Yes.

00:03:30.086 --> 00:03:31.087
We meet at last.

00:03:33.056 --> 00:03:35.058
This horrendous phenomenon,

00:03:35.091 --> 00:03:37.327
I regret to say
that even I cannot

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.828
light the way out of this.

00:03:39.929 --> 00:03:43.033
At this rate, everything
will vanish, and soon.

00:03:43.066 --> 00:03:44.567
(group gasping)

00:03:44.601 --> 00:03:45.869
Vanish.

00:03:45.902 --> 00:03:47.704
[Muchomon] We're all
going to disappear?

00:03:47.737 --> 00:03:49.072
(computer beeping)

00:03:49.105 --> 00:03:50.740
(Tai growling)

00:03:50.774 --> 00:03:52.876
-(Muchomon groaning)
-Don't worry.

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:55.378
We are not letting
something like that happen.

00:03:55.412 --> 00:03:56.946
So don't be scared.

00:03:57.914 --> 00:03:59.015
We're gonna stop it.

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:01.685
That's what we came here
to do and we'll do it!

00:04:01.718 --> 00:04:03.086
Don't worry.

00:04:03.119 --> 00:04:04.854
Yeah, just leave it to us.

00:04:04.888 --> 00:04:05.855
Come on, Matt!

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:06.890
Let's do it!

00:04:12.295 --> 00:04:14.230
I've gained many
things on my journey,

00:04:14.264 --> 00:04:15.598
valuable things!

00:04:15.632 --> 00:04:17.600
I'm not gonna let
them just disappear!

00:04:17.634 --> 00:04:19.202
We'll protect everyone who

00:04:19.235 --> 00:04:21.871
worked for us with
all our strength!

00:04:21.905 --> 00:04:23.239
Digimon.

00:04:23.273 --> 00:04:25.742
There have been some
weird and scary ones,

00:04:25.775 --> 00:04:27.577
but a lot of good ones, too.

00:04:28.611 --> 00:04:29.746
And if I know there's something

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:32.916
I can do to help
them, I'm gonna do it!

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:34.117
That's right!

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.086
Me too, so everybody
can rest assured!

00:04:36.119 --> 00:04:37.087
(Joe giggling)

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.421
[Joe] You said it, Gomamon.

00:04:39.489 --> 00:04:42.459
So the fate of the world
rests in our hands.

00:04:42.492 --> 00:04:44.561
[Tentomon] Izzy, listen to me.

00:04:44.594 --> 00:04:46.596
Don't let the
pressure get to you.

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:48.465
Let's just do the best we can.

00:04:48.498 --> 00:04:50.233
You're right, Tentomon.

00:04:50.266 --> 00:04:51.634
[Tentomon] I know.

00:04:51.668 --> 00:04:54.838
(inspirational music)

00:04:55.638 --> 00:04:57.307
[Wisemon] This is
what they have gained

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:58.908
from their adventure,

00:04:58.942 --> 00:05:01.578
the power to bond with Digimon

00:05:01.611 --> 00:05:03.113
and the Digital World.

00:05:06.015 --> 00:05:07.617
You might just do it.

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:09.085
Yes.

00:05:09.119 --> 00:05:12.122
You children might be
able to perform a miracle,

00:05:12.155 --> 00:05:14.858
even greater than that of
defeating Millenniummon.

00:05:16.292 --> 00:05:17.293
That's right.

00:05:18.294 --> 00:05:20.163
That's what I learned
at that castle,

00:05:22.031 --> 00:05:23.800
about the key to
the great power.

00:05:23.833 --> 00:05:27.137
-(alarm ringing)
-(Tai gasping)

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:30.173
(suspenseful music)

00:05:34.878 --> 00:05:36.112
Look! Up there!

00:05:38.047 --> 00:05:39.015
(group gasping)

00:05:39.048 --> 00:05:40.517
What the heck is that?

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:42.952
[Tentomon] Why did it
have to be tentacles?

00:05:42.986 --> 00:05:45.121
(Mimi gasping)

00:05:45.155 --> 00:05:46.189
(group yelling)

00:05:46.222 --> 00:05:48.224
(crash)

00:05:52.862 --> 00:05:54.297
(Leomon growling)

(group gasping)

(Tai coughing)

00:06:03.339 --> 00:06:06.176
(Tai growling)

00:06:06.209 --> 00:06:07.377
Tai!

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:10.180
(group growling)

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.482
Hang on, guys!

00:06:12.515 --> 00:06:14.717
(Tai growling)

00:06:14.751 --> 00:06:17.487
(Tai gasping)

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.322
(group gasping)

00:06:19.355 --> 00:06:22.158
Something's stopped the pain.

00:06:22.192 --> 00:06:24.727
(Matt gasping)

00:06:27.263 --> 00:06:29.933
(group yelling)

00:06:31.768 --> 00:06:32.735
Hang on, Tai!

00:06:32.769 --> 00:06:33.903
I'm coming for ya!

00:06:33.937 --> 00:06:35.004
[Tentomon] Izzy, come back!

00:06:35.038 --> 00:06:36.005
[Biyomon] Sora!

00:06:36.039 --> 00:06:37.006
[Gabumon] Matt!

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.208
Hand in there!

00:06:39.442 --> 00:06:40.410
[Gomamon] Joe!

00:06:40.443 --> 00:06:41.411
[Palmon] Mimi!

00:06:41.444 --> 00:06:42.512
[Patamon] Hang on, TK!

00:06:42.545 --> 00:06:43.546
[Gatomon] Kari!

00:06:45.548 --> 00:06:48.218
(group yelling)

00:06:52.956 --> 00:06:54.424
(Agumon gasping)

00:06:54.457 --> 00:06:59.462
-(group yelling)
-(suspenseful music)

00:07:06.302 --> 00:07:08.404
(Tai groaning)

00:07:08.438 --> 00:07:09.439
[Matt] Guys.

00:07:10.106 --> 00:07:11.374
[Tai] What?

00:07:11.407 --> 00:07:12.575
Is everyone okay?

00:07:12.609 --> 00:07:13.776
Somehow.

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:16.446
(TK gasping)

00:07:16.479 --> 00:07:19.916
[TK] Are we on the
other side of the crack?

00:07:21.317 --> 00:07:23.386
(Tai gasping)

00:07:23.419 --> 00:07:26.322
(mysterious music)

00:07:32.128 --> 00:07:33.596
(Kari whimpering)

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:35.131
It's all right, Kari.

00:07:35.164 --> 00:07:36.232
What is it?

00:07:36.266 --> 00:07:37.967
Or actually, forget I asked.

00:07:38.001 --> 00:07:39.102
(Mimi shivering)

00:07:39.135 --> 00:07:41.070
Whatever it is, that's
probably what pulled us

00:07:41.104 --> 00:07:42.805
into this place.

00:07:42.839 --> 00:07:44.107
(Joe gasping)

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:46.576
We might not wanna stick
around here too long.

00:07:46.609 --> 00:07:48.778
It's like the data's collapsing.

00:07:48.811 --> 00:07:52.282
No, it's more like
being obliterated.

00:07:53.349 --> 00:07:54.584
It can't be.

00:07:54.617 --> 00:07:56.085
Obliterated?

00:07:56.119 --> 00:07:58.588
Luckily, I think our
Digivices protected us

00:07:58.621 --> 00:08:00.924
-from the same fate.
-(Joe gasping)

00:08:00.957 --> 00:08:02.926
(Tai growling)

00:08:02.959 --> 00:08:07.163
[Tai] So then, is that
the Great Catastrophe?

00:08:09.332 --> 00:08:11.134
(Tai gasping)

00:08:11.167 --> 00:08:14.037
(mysterious music)

00:08:16.472 --> 00:08:17.473
Argomon.

00:08:18.708 --> 00:08:19.943
Argomon, huh?

00:08:19.976 --> 00:08:22.979
The one who made
contact with Tai before.

00:08:23.012 --> 00:08:26.449
(mysterious music)

00:08:26.482 --> 00:08:30.320
All existence, light, darkness,

00:08:31.888 --> 00:08:34.357
heaven, earth,

00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:39.395
birth and death, destruction
and resurrection.

00:08:40.229 --> 00:08:41.831
The one who consumes all.

00:08:43.566 --> 00:08:46.402
(mysterious music)

00:08:55.745 --> 00:08:58.414
(heart beating)

00:09:03.086 --> 00:09:05.521
That one is called...

00:09:07.423 --> 00:09:08.658
Negamon.

00:09:11.427 --> 00:09:12.428
Negamon.

00:09:15.231 --> 00:09:17.166
(Negamon buzzing)

00:09:22.805 --> 00:09:24.507
(chimes ringing)

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:27.844
(Gatomon blowing a raspberry)

00:09:27.877 --> 00:09:29.679
Tai, where are you?

00:09:29.712 --> 00:09:31.614
[Tentomon] Those of us
who can fly should go

00:09:31.647 --> 00:09:33.316
-after them and try to-
-No, wait!

00:09:33.349 --> 00:09:34.350
(group gasping)

00:09:38.521 --> 00:09:40.123
Negamon.

00:09:40.156 --> 00:09:42.692
(group gasping)

00:09:42.725 --> 00:09:44.494
Is it even a Digimon?

00:09:46.996 --> 00:09:48.798
As with all living things,

00:09:48.831 --> 00:09:52.502
Digimon experience
birth, life, and death.

00:09:53.669 --> 00:09:56.472
But death is not
the end for Digimon.

00:09:56.506 --> 00:10:00.209
They are reborn as
Digimon, they die again,

00:10:00.243 --> 00:10:03.746
and they live again,
over and over.

00:10:04.914 --> 00:10:08.017
That is why Digimon
and the Digital World

00:10:08.051 --> 00:10:09.919
continue to exist.

00:10:11.254 --> 00:10:15.858
Life and death, destruction
and resurrection,

00:10:15.892 --> 00:10:20.396
prosperity and
decline, war, survival,

00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:25.334
restoration, collapse,
elimination, suspension,

00:10:25.368 --> 00:10:28.704
beginning, ending,
beginning again.

00:10:29.372 --> 00:10:34.343
Through endless conflict and
endless repetition of tasks,

00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:37.046
the Digital World
evolved further

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:39.849
by accumulating and learning.

00:10:39.882 --> 00:10:40.883
War.

00:10:42.452 --> 00:10:44.087
So that ancient war.

00:10:46.389 --> 00:10:48.591
That war was an
evolutionary necessity

00:10:48.624 --> 00:10:51.360
brought about by the
pulse of Negamon.

00:10:51.394 --> 00:10:53.429
[Joe] What do you mean?

00:10:53.463 --> 00:10:54.931
(group gasping)

00:10:54.964 --> 00:10:56.232
[Argomon] The Digital World's

00:10:56.265 --> 00:10:59.068
negative law and disaster,

00:11:00.303 --> 00:11:02.105
that is Negamon.

00:11:03.406 --> 00:11:05.708
That is our reason to exist

00:11:05.741 --> 00:11:09.545
as well as our instinct.

00:11:09.579 --> 00:11:10.580
Instinct?

00:11:13.282 --> 00:11:16.052
(group yelling)

00:11:16.085 --> 00:11:18.788
(group growling)

00:11:19.589 --> 00:11:21.924
Now you'll al get up
there in one blast!

00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:23.292
(Garbagemon snickering)

00:11:23.326 --> 00:11:25.294
[Biyomon] Are you
sure about this?

00:11:25.328 --> 00:11:26.963
[Wisemon] Angle, check!

00:11:26.996 --> 00:11:28.898
[Tentomon] I'm
doing this for Izzy,

00:11:28.931 --> 00:11:30.266
so I can take it!

00:11:30.299 --> 00:11:31.267
I'm coming, Tai!

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:32.802
I'm coming! Hang on!

00:11:32.835 --> 00:11:35.104
Sora! I'll do my
best to save you!

00:11:35.138 --> 00:11:36.906
Mimi, please be okay!

00:11:36.939 --> 00:11:38.641
Hand in there, Joe!

00:11:38.674 --> 00:11:41.410
Kari, wherever you've
gone, I will find you!

00:11:41.444 --> 00:11:42.645
We're on our way, TK!

00:11:43.112 --> 00:11:44.080
Go on!

00:11:44.113 --> 00:11:46.249
Fire this thing already!

00:11:46.282 --> 00:11:49.118
-Firing!
-(cannon firing)

00:11:49.152 --> 00:11:51.420
(group yelling)

00:11:51.454 --> 00:11:52.955
Right on the money!

00:11:54.023 --> 00:11:57.160
(group yelling)

00:11:57.193 --> 00:11:58.161
[Biyomon] Oh no!

00:11:58.194 --> 00:11:59.195
Look!

00:12:01.364 --> 00:12:02.765
[Tentomon] Argomon?

00:12:02.798 --> 00:12:04.500
We have to change direction!

00:12:04.534 --> 00:12:05.501
Okay, sure!

00:12:05.535 --> 00:12:06.802
But how?

00:12:06.836 --> 00:12:09.272
(suspenseful music)

00:12:09.305 --> 00:12:12.208
(lasers exploding)

00:12:13.709 --> 00:12:16.379
(group gasping)

00:12:19.348 --> 00:12:20.850
[Argomon] Those
within your hands

00:12:20.883 --> 00:12:23.019
are the extreme opposite of us,

00:12:23.052 --> 00:12:25.121
the materialization of the

00:12:25.154 --> 00:12:28.491
Digital World's
instinct to exist.

00:12:28.524 --> 00:12:30.660
The power needed to survive.

00:12:30.693 --> 00:12:32.695
The power needed to be born.

00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:35.231
The power needed to begin.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.369
[Argomon] At one point, the
two instincts reached out

00:12:40.403 --> 00:12:42.171
to the outer world,

00:12:42.205 --> 00:12:46.175
seeking to find the
potential in humans.

00:12:47.343 --> 00:12:49.145
One of the them
found you children

00:12:49.178 --> 00:12:51.380
who had formed a
connection with Digimon

00:12:54.517 --> 00:12:56.519
and opened a new path.

00:12:57.853 --> 00:13:00.323
[Wisemon] The ones who
summoned all of you here

00:13:00.356 --> 00:13:04.260
would be us as well as
this Digital World itself.

00:13:06.529 --> 00:13:08.497
(Tai growling)

00:13:08.531 --> 00:13:10.066
[Argomon] Much of
the data passing

00:13:10.099 --> 00:13:13.002
through the network
created by humans

00:13:13.035 --> 00:13:16.339
consists of chaos and fear,

00:13:16.372 --> 00:13:19.342
which produces negative energy.

00:13:19.375 --> 00:13:21.410
Negamon chose that energy as the

00:13:21.444 --> 00:13:25.081
power source to create
the next disaster.

00:13:25.114 --> 00:13:26.849
And those who resonated with the

00:13:26.882 --> 00:13:30.586
waves of destruction
also joined us.

00:13:31.787 --> 00:13:34.523
Feeding off of the
chaos of our world!

00:13:34.557 --> 00:13:36.926
[Argomon] The endless
flow of negative energy

00:13:36.959 --> 00:13:41.364
filling the network exceeded
even Negamon's expectations.

00:13:41.397 --> 00:13:44.900
It was an abundant
and delicious meal,

00:13:44.934 --> 00:13:46.936
but that led to more hunger,

00:13:46.969 --> 00:13:50.706
more consumption, and
more satisfaction.

00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:54.377
Then more hunger,
and more consumption.

00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:57.113
Driven by this
unstoppable impulse,

00:13:57.146 --> 00:14:01.384
Negamon will consume all,
consume every existence,

00:14:01.417 --> 00:14:03.886
and evolve into the
ultimate destruction

00:14:03.919 --> 00:14:06.722
when nothing is born
or will ever begin.

00:14:06.756 --> 00:14:08.724
The absolute end.

00:14:08.758 --> 00:14:11.727
In what world is that
kind of thing a good idea?

00:14:11.761 --> 00:14:14.230
This keeps getting more
bizarre by the minute!

00:14:14.263 --> 00:14:15.731
(Izzy growling)

00:14:15.765 --> 00:14:18.467
[Izzy] The growing power has
taken over the real purpose.

00:14:18.501 --> 00:14:21.437
It's invaded Negamon's
instinct and overridden it!

00:14:22.438 --> 00:14:25.308
[Matt] To eat, only to eat more.

00:14:25.341 --> 00:14:28.311
A creature that exists
only to consume!

00:14:28.344 --> 00:14:29.578
[Argomon] Eventually,

00:14:29.612 --> 00:14:32.148
Negamon will consume
the soul of all

00:14:32.181 --> 00:14:33.983
and an infinite void will come.

00:14:35.017 --> 00:14:37.486
That is the ultimate destruction

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:39.488
Negamon's instinct seeks.

00:14:41.123 --> 00:14:42.591
(Tai gasping)

00:14:42.625 --> 00:14:45.194
(Tai growling)

00:14:46.329 --> 00:14:47.663
-(cannon beeping)
-(Garbagemon gasping)

00:14:47.697 --> 00:14:48.931
(cannon banging)

00:14:48.964 --> 00:14:50.599
What are you doing?

00:14:50.633 --> 00:14:53.836
-(cannon exploding)
-(Garbagemon yelling)

00:14:53.869 --> 00:14:58.841
-(group yelling)
-(Komondomon howling)

00:14:58.874 --> 00:15:01.377
[Tentomon] Who's a good boy?

00:15:02.845 --> 00:15:03.979
Komondomon!

00:15:04.013 --> 00:15:05.014
(Komondomon barking)

00:15:05.047 --> 00:15:06.349
(Agumon giggling)

00:15:06.382 --> 00:15:08.851
(Komondomon howling)

00:15:08.884 --> 00:15:10.286
(group yelling)

00:15:10.319 --> 00:15:12.021
Thank you, Komondomon!

00:15:12.054 --> 00:15:14.490
We'll see that your
efforts don't go to waste!

00:15:15.658 --> 00:15:17.326
[Garbagemon] We're
counting on you!

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:20.279
(Komondomon howling)

00:15:23.482 --> 00:15:25.451
(splash)

00:15:25.484 --> 00:15:29.455
[Wisemon] The fate of the
world is in their hands.

00:15:29.488 --> 00:15:31.590
[Tentomon] What's going on?

00:15:31.624 --> 00:15:32.958
[Gabumon] We're breaking apart!

00:15:32.992 --> 00:15:35.895
Hate to think of Mimi
going through this!

00:15:35.928 --> 00:15:37.563
They're right behind us!

00:15:37.596 --> 00:15:40.166
(Tai growling)

00:15:43.102 --> 00:15:44.270
No matter what!

00:15:45.337 --> 00:15:46.939
We have got to protect!

00:15:46.972 --> 00:15:48.641
Everything we value!

00:15:48.674 --> 00:15:49.909
This world and!

00:15:49.942 --> 00:15:50.910
Everyone in it!

00:15:50.943 --> 00:15:53.079
Protect 'em with our own hands!

00:15:53.112 --> 00:15:54.680
We're never ever!

00:15:56.115 --> 00:15:58.451
[Tai] Gonna let anybody
destroy what's precious to us!

00:15:58.484 --> 00:16:00.419
(group yelling)

00:16:00.453 --> 00:16:02.421
[Biyomon] Agumon!

00:16:02.455 --> 00:16:03.422
[Agumon] Tai!

00:16:03.456 --> 00:16:04.423
(voice echoing)

00:16:04.457 --> 00:16:06.992
(Tai gasping)

00:16:07.026 --> 00:16:08.027
Agumon!

00:16:10.463 --> 00:16:13.766
(group yelling)

00:16:13.799 --> 00:16:16.802
(upbeat rock music)

00:16:20.473 --> 00:16:23.142
[Agumon] Agumon, digivolve to!

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:29.949
[Greymon] Greymon!

00:16:29.982 --> 00:16:32.885
(Greymon growling)

00:16:38.657 --> 00:16:39.658
Nova Blast!

00:16:41.727 --> 00:16:43.295
(fireball exploding)

00:16:43.329 --> 00:16:44.363
You digivolved!

00:16:44.396 --> 00:16:45.831
And the battle's
already started!

00:16:45.865 --> 00:16:46.866
Look!

00:16:51.003 --> 00:16:52.138
Matt!

00:16:52.171 --> 00:16:53.139
(Matt gasping)

00:16:53.172 --> 00:16:54.173
Gabumon!

00:16:55.007 --> 00:16:58.043
[Gabumon] Gabumon digivolve to!

00:16:58.077 --> 00:17:01.080
(upbeat rock music)

00:17:04.517 --> 00:17:06.519
[Garurumon] Garurumon!

00:17:07.586 --> 00:17:09.722
(Garurumon growling)

00:17:09.755 --> 00:17:12.424
(group gasping)

00:17:17.763 --> 00:17:20.566
(Garurumon howling)

00:17:20.599 --> 00:17:21.700
Biyomon!

00:17:21.734 --> 00:17:23.035
Sora, thank goodness
you're safe!

00:17:23.068 --> 00:17:24.503
[Tentomon] Oh, I
missed you, Izzy!

00:17:24.537 --> 00:17:25.738
You too, Tentomon!

00:17:25.771 --> 00:17:27.173
Mimi, are you okay?

00:17:27.206 --> 00:17:28.674
Yeah, I am now!

00:17:28.707 --> 00:17:30.075
Sorry for the wait, Joe.

00:17:30.109 --> 00:17:31.677
I'm just glad you're here!

00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:32.678
You made it!

00:17:32.711 --> 00:17:33.846
Gatomon!

00:17:33.879 --> 00:17:34.914
-(Gatomon giggling)
-(Kari giggling)

00:17:34.947 --> 00:17:36.115
[Garurumon] Hey, Matt.

00:17:43.556 --> 00:17:44.557
Perfect timing.
