WEBVTT

00:00:08.432 --> 00:00:11.068
(bright music)

00:00:11.377 --> 00:00:14.647
[Izzy] And now for the
Digimon Encyclopedia.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:15.948
Agumon.

00:00:15.982 --> 00:00:18.784
A curious Digimon who
really loves eating.

00:00:18.818 --> 00:00:20.119
Agumon uses pepper breath

00:00:20.153 --> 00:00:22.555
and his sharp claws to
fight off his enemies.

00:00:23.823 --> 00:00:26.125
What makes him such a
good partner for Tai?

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:27.460
Because Agumon and Tai

00:00:27.493 --> 00:00:29.462
are bound by such a
strong friendship,

00:00:29.495 --> 00:00:31.697
they're perfectly in
sync with each other.

00:00:31.731 --> 00:00:34.534
That strong bond may lead to
some unexpected consequences

00:00:34.567 --> 00:00:35.535
one day.

00:00:35.568 --> 00:00:38.137
(electronic beeping)

00:00:38.171 --> 00:00:40.239
Which Digimon will
it be next time?

[Narrator] The journey continues

00:02:11.981 --> 00:02:14.951
as the children search
for the Celestial Digimon

00:02:14.984 --> 00:02:17.820
who are key to ending
Tokyo's blackout.

00:02:19.488 --> 00:02:21.123
Thanks to Ikkakumon,

00:02:21.157 --> 00:02:24.627
Tai and his friends manage to
cross the Digital World's Sea

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.128
and reach a new land.

00:02:26.162 --> 00:02:28.331
But what awaited them
there were attacks

00:02:28.364 --> 00:02:30.399
from a fortress
built on the shore.

00:02:31.701 --> 00:02:34.036
(dramatic music)

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.138
(bullets exploding)

00:02:36.172 --> 00:02:38.674
Just when all hope
seems to be lost,

00:02:38.708 --> 00:02:41.010
Matt and his partner,
Gabumon, appear,

00:02:41.043 --> 00:02:44.380
and reunite with Tai and
the rest of the group.

00:02:44.413 --> 00:02:47.183
(dramatic music)

00:02:48.551 --> 00:02:51.053
In order to find out
who's been targeting them,

00:02:51.087 --> 00:02:53.723
the six Digi-destined
children work together

00:02:53.756 --> 00:02:55.725
against their common enemy.

00:02:55.758 --> 00:02:58.060
After a long and arduous fight,

00:02:58.094 --> 00:02:59.829
the children are
able to break through

00:02:59.862 --> 00:03:03.432
the opponent's defenses and
neutralize the enemy fortress.

00:03:03.466 --> 00:03:07.703
(dramatic music)

00:03:10.706 --> 00:03:15.011
Once inside, Tai begins
decoding a mysterious message,

00:03:15.044 --> 00:03:17.179
and he realizes...

00:03:17.213 --> 00:03:19.849
(dramatic music)

00:03:19.882 --> 00:03:21.417
-This is-
-Huh?

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.419
(dramatic music)

00:03:23.452 --> 00:03:26.622
This is about the
Celestial Digimon.

00:03:30.726 --> 00:03:32.595
[Reporter] We're coming
to you live from Tokyo

00:03:32.628 --> 00:03:34.764
where we're about to
experience the first evening

00:03:34.797 --> 00:03:36.799
during this mysterious
power outage.

00:03:38.067 --> 00:03:40.269
As you can see, all
city lights are out

00:03:40.302 --> 00:03:42.905
except for self-generated
facilities.

00:03:42.938 --> 00:03:44.740
We are in total darkness.

00:03:45.941 --> 00:03:47.710
The government has
named this incident

00:03:47.743 --> 00:03:50.212
the metropolitan
power loss disaster

00:03:50.246 --> 00:03:52.415
and they are asking
people to stay indoors.

00:03:53.916 --> 00:03:57.086
(TV static crackling)

00:03:59.255 --> 00:04:01.991
(wings flapping)

00:04:03.793 --> 00:04:06.462
(sonic beeping)

00:04:10.666 --> 00:04:14.603
I ordered you to eliminate
the Digi-destined.

00:04:15.771 --> 00:04:18.741
Nevertheless, do not worry.

00:04:18.774 --> 00:04:21.944
I will send new
soldiers to do the job.

00:04:21.977 --> 00:04:24.947
So be sure to complete
your mission next time.

00:04:26.282 --> 00:04:30.986
If you do not, you will
know the consequences

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.489
that you will face.

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.293
(dramatic music)

00:04:47.203 --> 00:04:49.939
(Ogremon growling)

00:04:49.972 --> 00:04:52.975
(Ogremon screaming)

00:04:59.548 --> 00:05:02.218
(air whooshing)

00:05:08.824 --> 00:05:12.194
It says, "The Celestial Digimon

00:05:14.363 --> 00:05:18.000
is within our hands of darkness.

00:05:18.033 --> 00:05:21.537
And now that power is..."

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:23.139
"Within our hands?"

00:05:23.172 --> 00:05:25.508
They must have been captured.

00:05:25.541 --> 00:05:26.709
Captured by whom?

00:05:26.742 --> 00:05:28.377
If it said, "Within our hands,"

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:31.313
it must mean the guys who
were in this fortress, right?

00:05:31.347 --> 00:05:32.982
Does it say more?

00:05:33.015 --> 00:05:36.685
Sorry, but I can't make out
the rest of the message.

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:38.320
I just can't read it.

00:05:38.354 --> 00:05:40.890
So they captured the
Celestial Digimon,

00:05:40.923 --> 00:05:43.159
and for some reason
they wanna kill us.

00:05:43.192 --> 00:05:45.828
What could they possibly be
trying to gain from all this?

00:05:45.861 --> 00:05:47.062
Beats me.

00:05:47.096 --> 00:05:48.697
But if the Celestial
Digimon's captured,

00:05:48.731 --> 00:05:50.232
we need a rescue plan fast.

00:05:50.266 --> 00:05:53.002
But we don't even know where
to start looking for 'em.

00:05:53.035 --> 00:05:54.670
Isn't that pretty obvious?

00:05:54.703 --> 00:05:57.039
What? You know
where to go, Mimi?

00:05:57.072 --> 00:05:58.707
It's somewhere on
this continent.

00:05:58.741 --> 00:06:00.075
Gee, thanks.

00:06:00.109 --> 00:06:02.745
But we need more info
than just somewhere.

00:06:02.778 --> 00:06:06.081
Like some sort of map
or something like that.

00:06:06.115 --> 00:06:08.384
I don't think a map is
gonna have our goal marked

00:06:08.417 --> 00:06:09.618
with an X on it.

00:06:10.452 --> 00:06:11.921
Hmm.

00:06:11.954 --> 00:06:14.223
Considering this fortress
was built on the coast,

00:06:14.256 --> 00:06:16.258
it's purpose must be
to prevent intruders

00:06:16.292 --> 00:06:18.727
from ever making their
way onto the continent.

00:06:18.761 --> 00:06:21.597
So their headquarters
must be further inland.

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:24.867
If the Celestial Digimon
did fall into enemy hands,

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.135
then that's where we look.

00:06:26.936 --> 00:06:29.605
We know those other guys are
going to keep targeting us

00:06:29.638 --> 00:06:31.540
no matter where we go.

00:06:31.574 --> 00:06:35.544
So we beat them and force all
the info we can out of them.

00:06:35.578 --> 00:06:36.779
[All] Hmm.

00:06:36.812 --> 00:06:37.780
(exploding sound)

00:06:37.813 --> 00:06:38.781
-Huh?
-Huh?

00:06:38.814 --> 00:06:39.882
What's that?

00:06:39.915 --> 00:06:42.751
(exploding sound)

00:06:45.955 --> 00:06:47.890
(Ogremon growling)

00:06:47.923 --> 00:06:48.891
(footsteps pattering)

00:06:48.924 --> 00:06:49.925
Huh?

00:06:52.161 --> 00:06:53.162
Huh!

00:06:54.096 --> 00:06:55.397
Him again.

00:06:55.431 --> 00:06:58.167
(dramatic music)

00:07:07.843 --> 00:07:10.846
(Ogremon screaming)

00:07:17.953 --> 00:07:20.456
(Tai gasping)

00:07:26.528 --> 00:07:27.663
Evolve now!

00:07:32.534 --> 00:07:35.471
(Ogremon snarling)

00:07:35.504 --> 00:07:37.723
(suspenseful music)

00:07:42.937 --> 00:07:44.271
What do you say?

00:07:44.305 --> 00:07:45.272
Wanna take him on?

00:07:45.306 --> 00:07:46.774
(Agumon grunting)

00:07:46.807 --> 00:07:49.777
(footsteps pattering)

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:52.079
(Ogremon snarling)

00:07:52.112 --> 00:07:55.382
(dramatic music)

00:07:55.416 --> 00:07:57.051
(metal clanging)
(crunching sound)

00:07:57.084 --> 00:08:00.287
(Ogremon screaming)

00:08:00.321 --> 00:08:03.057
-Hey, what's going on?
-His aura's way too powerful!

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:04.091
No doubt about it.

00:08:04.124 --> 00:08:05.626
That's gotta be Ogremon!

00:08:05.659 --> 00:08:07.561
And he looks way
angrier than before!

00:08:07.594 --> 00:08:08.562
Now I remember!

00:08:08.595 --> 00:08:10.798
He's that green guy who
attacked us earlier!

00:08:10.831 --> 00:08:13.100
Did he come back to
finish what he started?

00:08:14.768 --> 00:08:16.437
What is it you want from us?

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:18.138
You came here
looking for a fight.

00:08:18.172 --> 00:08:19.473
Consider it done.

00:08:19.506 --> 00:08:21.909
So tell us, are
you with the guys

00:08:21.942 --> 00:08:23.978
who captured the
Celestial Digimon?

00:08:24.011 --> 00:08:27.014
(suspenseful music)

00:08:28.615 --> 00:08:29.950
We fought.

00:08:29.984 --> 00:08:30.985
I lost.

00:08:32.019 --> 00:08:34.455
My horn, you broke.

00:08:36.457 --> 00:08:38.792
Horn is greatest pride.

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:41.495
So that's it.

00:08:41.528 --> 00:08:44.598
(dramatic music)

00:08:44.631 --> 00:08:46.333
Guess he wants revenge.

00:08:46.367 --> 00:08:47.368
Huh!

00:08:48.969 --> 00:08:50.337
Fight again here.

00:08:50.371 --> 00:08:52.473
I win.

00:08:52.506 --> 00:08:54.641
Reclaim my pride.

00:08:55.642 --> 00:08:58.445
(footsteps thudding)

00:08:58.479 --> 00:09:00.614
-You're on, buddy.
-Hmm.

00:09:00.647 --> 00:09:05.386
(rock music)

00:09:25.205 --> 00:09:28.308
[Agumon] Agumon, digivolve to...

00:09:28.342 --> 00:09:33.080
(singing in Japanese)

00:09:41.422 --> 00:09:43.724
[Greymon] Greymon!

00:09:43.757 --> 00:09:48.529

(Ogremon screaming)

00:10:04.711 --> 00:10:07.581
(Ogremon snarling)

00:10:09.783 --> 00:10:11.752
Look at Tai.

00:10:11.785 --> 00:10:14.088
It looks like something
out of a movie.

00:10:14.121 --> 00:10:15.089
(all gasping)

00:10:15.122 --> 00:10:16.256
Come on, what now?

00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:17.925
[Palmon] Ah!

00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:19.927
Giant flying Digimon incoming,

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:21.428
and lots of 'em too!

00:10:21.462 --> 00:10:23.230
[Gabumon] Those are Coredramon!

00:10:23.263 --> 00:10:24.531
(Ogremon grunting)

00:10:24.565 --> 00:10:25.933
(laser firing)

00:10:25.966 --> 00:10:28.602
(all screaming)

00:10:30.137 --> 00:10:31.438
Let's do this!

00:10:32.639 --> 00:10:37.277
(singing in Japanese)

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:53.560
[Gabumon] Gabumon,
digivolve to...

00:10:53.594 --> 00:10:58.332
(singing in Japanese)

00:11:05.973 --> 00:11:06.974
Garurumon!

00:11:09.009 --> 00:11:10.244
Ready, Biyomon?

00:11:10.277 --> 00:11:11.411
Ah!

00:11:11.445 --> 00:11:14.114
(all screaming)

00:11:15.616 --> 00:11:20.320
You guys okay?

00:11:20.354 --> 00:11:21.321
(ground exploding)

00:11:21.355 --> 00:11:27.261
(Ogremon growling)

00:11:27.294 --> 00:11:28.695
Howling Blaster!

00:11:31.131 --> 00:11:33.800
(lasers firing)

00:11:42.042 --> 00:11:44.945
(lasers pattering)

00:11:44.978 --> 00:11:48.649
Feel the power of
Electro Shocker!

00:11:48.682 --> 00:11:50.184
Hit 'em dead on!

00:11:50.217 --> 00:11:51.451
How you like that?

00:11:51.485 --> 00:11:52.486
Ha, Izzy!

00:11:54.154 --> 00:11:56.190
Hey there, everyone!

00:11:56.223 --> 00:11:59.326
(dramatic music)

00:11:59.359 --> 00:12:01.495
Hey, they all waited for us.

00:12:01.528 --> 00:12:02.529
Aw, shucks!

00:12:03.864 --> 00:12:06.333
I can't believe I'm
finally here with you guys.

00:12:06.366 --> 00:12:07.834
Ugh, that was rough.

00:12:07.868 --> 00:12:10.003
If you need me, I'll
be taking a nap.

00:12:10.037 --> 00:12:12.706
I'd feel that way too if I
flew the entire way here.

00:12:12.739 --> 00:12:15.375
I can't thank you
enough, Tentomon.

00:12:15.409 --> 00:12:16.476
Izzy, you're safe!

00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:18.512
Pleasure to meet you, I'm Mimi.

00:12:18.545 --> 00:12:20.881
My name's Joe and I'm
the leader around here.

00:12:20.914 --> 00:12:23.550
Huh, what are you talking about?

00:12:23.584 --> 00:12:24.851
(all gasping)

00:12:24.885 --> 00:12:27.988
(electricity buzzing)

00:12:28.021 --> 00:12:29.990
-Hurry up and evolve again!
-What, me?

00:12:30.023 --> 00:12:31.658
Why don't you digivolve?

00:12:31.692 --> 00:12:34.261
(laser firing)

00:12:36.096 --> 00:12:37.264
Pummel Whack!

00:12:39.233 --> 00:12:41.868
(air whooshing)

00:12:44.204 --> 00:12:46.540
(exploding sound)

00:12:46.573 --> 00:12:48.909
(Tai gasping)

00:12:48.942 --> 00:12:50.043
Huh?

00:12:50.077 --> 00:12:53.080
(suspenseful music)

00:12:55.215 --> 00:12:57.084
(Ogremon growling)

00:12:57.117 --> 00:13:00.921
(suspenseful music)

00:13:00.954 --> 00:13:01.955
Greymon.

00:13:03.223 --> 00:13:04.258
Child.

00:13:04.291 --> 00:13:07.227
(suspenseful music)

00:13:07.261 --> 00:13:11.431
Our battle begins now!

00:13:11.465 --> 00:13:15.811
(suspenseful music)

00:13:33.704 --> 00:13:36.340
(dramatic music)

00:13:36.373 --> 00:13:39.009
(Ogremon growling)

00:13:39.042 --> 00:13:41.845
(dramatic music)

00:13:46.984 --> 00:13:47.951
[Joe] Look at that.

00:13:47.985 --> 00:13:49.486
The Coredramon are fleeing.

00:13:49.519 --> 00:13:50.487
What's wrong?

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:51.488
Had enough already?

00:13:51.521 --> 00:13:52.990
[Tentomon] What are
you bragging about?

00:13:53.023 --> 00:13:54.358
You didn't defeat 'em.

00:13:54.391 --> 00:13:55.625
Huh?

00:13:55.659 --> 00:13:57.327
Something on your
mind there, Izzy?

00:13:58.328 --> 00:13:59.629
I don't get it.

00:13:59.663 --> 00:14:01.665
Why did they just
give up so easily?

00:14:03.667 --> 00:14:06.403
I have a feeling that wasn't
the last of the attacks.

00:14:08.505 --> 00:14:11.975
(Ogremon snarling)

00:14:12.009 --> 00:14:15.012
(Ogremon screaming)

00:14:17.514 --> 00:14:19.883
(metal clanging)

00:14:19.916 --> 00:14:21.351
(Ogremon snarling)

00:14:21.385 --> 00:14:23.553
(suspenseful music)

00:14:23.587 --> 00:14:26.656
(Ogremon snarling)

00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:29.693
(suspenseful music)

00:14:31.228 --> 00:14:33.497
(Ogremon screaming)

00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:37.234
(suspenseful music)

00:14:37.267 --> 00:14:40.337
(Ogremon screaming)

00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:41.605
Greymon, now!

00:14:43.607 --> 00:14:46.610
(Ogremon screaming)

00:14:47.778 --> 00:14:50.614
(Ogremon grunting)

00:14:52.549 --> 00:14:54.084
(Tai grunting)

00:14:54.117 --> 00:14:55.252
Huh?

00:14:55.285 --> 00:14:58.688
(suspenseful music)

00:14:58.722 --> 00:15:00.057
(Greymon growling)

00:15:00.090 --> 00:15:03.060
(Greymon grunting)

00:15:04.594 --> 00:15:07.264
(both grunting)

00:15:12.769 --> 00:15:15.772
(Ogremon screaming)

00:15:19.109 --> 00:15:21.778
(both grunting)

00:15:28.585 --> 00:15:31.755
(electricity buzzing)

00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:35.792
(Ogremon chuckling)

00:15:35.826 --> 00:15:38.829
(suspenseful music)

00:15:40.297 --> 00:15:42.265
Whoa! The last
time they fought

00:15:42.299 --> 00:15:43.767
wasn't nearly as
intense as this.

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:46.236
[Mimi] They had such fierce
looks on their faces earlier,

00:15:46.269 --> 00:15:48.772
but now it kinda looks
like they're having fun.

00:15:48.805 --> 00:15:49.773
Doesn't it?

00:15:49.806 --> 00:15:51.241
(both grunting)

00:15:51.274 --> 00:15:54.978
(electricity buzzing)

00:15:55.011 --> 00:15:57.848
(thudding sounds)

00:16:02.686 --> 00:16:05.122
(electricity buzzing)

00:16:05.155 --> 00:16:07.324
(both grunting)

00:16:07.357 --> 00:16:10.360
(suspenseful music)

00:16:14.364 --> 00:16:15.665
Pummel Whack!

00:16:18.869 --> 00:16:21.872
(suspenseful music)

00:16:23.306 --> 00:16:25.308
(Ogremon snarling)

00:16:25.342 --> 00:16:26.376
Nova Blast!

00:16:29.045 --> 00:16:31.515
(suspenseful music)

00:16:31.548 --> 00:16:32.682
Huh?

00:16:32.716 --> 00:16:35.719
(suspenseful music)

00:16:37.821 --> 00:16:39.289
(Ogremon grunting)

00:16:39.322 --> 00:16:42.325
(suspenseful music)

00:16:47.397 --> 00:16:49.032
(fortress exploding)

00:16:49.065 --> 00:16:50.467
(all screaming)

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:53.570
(fortress exploding)

00:16:57.407 --> 00:17:00.544
(footsteps thudding)

00:17:06.183 --> 00:17:07.184
Huh?

00:17:10.053 --> 00:17:11.888
What in the world?

00:17:11.922 --> 00:17:14.691
(suspenseful music)

00:17:14.724 --> 00:17:17.861
(footsteps thudding)

00:17:26.536 --> 00:17:27.537
(Joe gasping)

00:17:27.571 --> 00:17:28.672
What is that thing?

00:17:28.705 --> 00:17:30.840
I've never seen one
with my own eyes before.

00:17:30.874 --> 00:17:32.242
This is bad.

00:17:32.275 --> 00:17:34.044
We've got a behemoth
on our hands.

00:17:35.045 --> 00:17:37.581
Garurumon, is that-

00:17:37.614 --> 00:17:40.283
Yes, an ultimate Digimon.

00:17:41.418 --> 00:17:43.687
Ultimate Digimon?

00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:45.422
How... Wait.

00:17:45.455 --> 00:17:46.456
That's right.

00:17:47.257 --> 00:17:48.925
The voice that led us here said

00:17:48.959 --> 00:17:52.429
all Digimon will grow,
mature, and become stronger.

00:17:53.897 --> 00:17:56.766
So it makes sense that all
Digimon can reach a state

00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:58.935
where they've completed
their digivolution!

00:17:59.803 --> 00:18:02.806
(suspenseful music)

00:18:05.575 --> 00:18:08.912
Let the death and
destruction begin.

00:18:10.814 --> 00:18:13.817
(suspenseful music)

00:18:14.985 --> 00:18:18.421
(electricity buzzing)

00:18:18.455 --> 00:18:21.057
(all screaming)

00:18:21.091 --> 00:18:24.094
(suspenseful music)

00:18:28.965 --> 00:18:32.269
Greymon!

00:18:33.803 --> 00:18:35.472
Get away from there!

00:18:35.505 --> 00:18:38.174
(foot crashing)

00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:43.647
(footsteps thudding)

00:18:49.286 --> 00:18:51.087
(Tai gasping)

00:18:51.121 --> 00:18:54.124
(suspenseful music)

00:19:02.365 --> 00:19:05.468
(footsteps thudding)

00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:13.043
(Greymon screaming)

00:19:17.147 --> 00:19:20.150
(suspenseful music)

00:19:22.152 --> 00:19:23.153
Greymon, no!

00:19:24.054 --> 00:19:26.356
(Greymon crashing)

00:19:26.389 --> 00:19:30.060
(Ultimate Digimon groaning)

00:19:35.198 --> 00:19:39.035
So this is the power
of an Ultimate Digimon.

00:19:40.337 --> 00:19:42.038
(Tai panting)

00:19:42.072 --> 00:19:43.039
Agumon!

00:19:43.073 --> 00:19:44.708
Just hang in there, buddy.

00:19:44.741 --> 00:19:45.709
I gotcha.

00:19:45.742 --> 00:19:46.710
(Agumon groaning)

00:19:46.743 --> 00:19:47.977
(footsteps thudding)

00:19:48.011 --> 00:19:50.513
(Tai gasping)

00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:56.753
(Ogremon screaming)

00:20:03.193 --> 00:20:04.394
I understand.

00:20:05.362 --> 00:20:07.931
Bigger Digimon replace Ogremon.

00:20:09.032 --> 00:20:12.035
(suspenseful music)

00:20:15.939 --> 00:20:18.875
(Ogremon groaning)

00:20:23.446 --> 00:20:24.547
Pummel Whack!

00:20:28.451 --> 00:20:31.454
(Ogremon screaming)

00:20:32.422 --> 00:20:35.392
(suspenseful music)

00:20:38.128 --> 00:20:40.797
(dramatic music)

00:20:43.299 --> 00:20:44.267
[Tai] Huh?

00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:45.301
Go.

00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:50.774
Celestial Digimon lies ahead.

00:20:52.609 --> 00:20:54.611
Go straight, child.

00:20:59.149 --> 00:21:01.084
Go straight ahead.

00:21:03.987 --> 00:21:06.289
Thank you, Ogremon.

00:21:06.322 --> 00:21:08.825
(all gasping)

00:21:09.926 --> 00:21:11.127
(footsteps thudding)

00:21:11.161 --> 00:21:12.128

00:21:39.689 --> 00:21:41.357
What are you doing?
