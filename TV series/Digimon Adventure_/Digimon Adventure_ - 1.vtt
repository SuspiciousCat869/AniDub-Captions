[Narrator] In the year 2020 CE,

the human world is
connected by a network.

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:21.156
That network is inhabited

00:00:21.198 --> 00:00:25.285
by an unknown life
form called Digimon.

(dialer beeps)

00:02:14.561 --> 00:02:15.562
The Network.

00:02:18.648 --> 00:02:21.902
It unlocks the future of
mankind and the world,

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.239
and it continues to evolve.

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:28.742
(water drops)

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.413
Now, the Network is
about to connect further

00:02:33.413 --> 00:02:35.582
into uncharted territory.

00:02:38.001 --> 00:02:41.004
(mysterious rumbles)

00:02:47.928 --> 00:02:50.305
(peaceful music)

00:02:50.347 --> 00:02:52.849
(wings flaps)

00:03:00.273 --> 00:03:04.110
[Tai] Okay, sleeping bag
check, water bottle check.

00:03:04.152 --> 00:03:05.278
Let's see.

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:06.988
Oh yeah, my gloves.

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.989
(phone rings)

00:03:08.031 --> 00:03:09.115
Huh?

00:03:09.115 --> 00:03:10.951
Hey mom, are you already there?

00:03:10.992 --> 00:03:12.118
That was fast.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.621
[Tai's mom] We're still at
Shibuya, just transferring.

00:03:14.621 --> 00:03:16.957
I feel a little lost here.

00:03:16.957 --> 00:03:18.500
[Tai] That's why I said you
should take lessons closer

00:03:18.541 --> 00:03:19.501
to home.

00:03:19.542 --> 00:03:20.502
Bug spray, check.

00:03:20.543 --> 00:03:21.962
[Tai's mom] Yes I know.

00:03:21.962 --> 00:03:23.630
Sounds like you're
preparing for camp.

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.007
[Tai] I'm so organized,
I could go to the moon!

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:27.634
Pants check, shirt check.

00:03:27.634 --> 00:03:28.635
Oh, Kari?

00:03:28.635 --> 00:03:29.636
Huh?

00:03:30.387 --> 00:03:31.346
[Tai] Help Mom find her way.

00:03:31.388 --> 00:03:32.347
(Kari giggles)

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:33.348
[Kari] Okay.

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:34.349
[Tai's mom] We're
transferring trains,

00:03:34.391 --> 00:03:35.850
so I'm gonna let you go.

00:03:35.892 --> 00:03:40.480
Okay, now let's see what's
going on in the world.

00:03:41.398 --> 00:03:42.649
We're getting some reports,

00:03:42.649 --> 00:03:44.234
the government has
also been affected.

00:03:46.403 --> 00:03:47.362
Uh.

00:03:47.404 --> 00:03:48.655
[Tai] Yes.

00:03:48.655 --> 00:03:50.198
Good morning.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.534
I'm your neighbor from upstairs.

00:03:52.575 --> 00:03:54.202
Yeah, I've seen you around.

00:03:54.244 --> 00:03:56.329
At school, right?

00:03:56.371 --> 00:03:58.665
My name is Koshiro Izumi.

00:03:58.665 --> 00:04:03.378
Hm, My name's Taichi
Kamiya, nice to meet ya.

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:08.174
Uh, hi, and umm, it's
nice to meet you as well.

00:04:08.216 --> 00:04:11.219
So, umm, I have a
question I wanted to ask

00:04:11.261 --> 00:04:12.887
about the next kids' club camp.

00:04:12.929 --> 00:04:15.015
Um, Taichi, I came
to you because.

00:04:15.056 --> 00:04:16.683
You can just call me Tai.

00:04:16.683 --> 00:04:17.684
Come on in, dude.

00:04:17.684 --> 00:04:19.519
Uh, no, I don't wanna intrude.

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:22.355
[Tai] You'd be doing me a favor.
I was getting bored anyway.

00:04:22.355 --> 00:04:23.565
[News Host]
Continuing our report

00:04:23.606 --> 00:04:25.400
on the major cyber
attack primarily targeted

00:04:25.442 --> 00:04:26.901
at central Tokyo.

00:04:26.943 --> 00:04:28.403
The damages appear
to be widespread

00:04:28.445 --> 00:04:29.529
-throughout the area
-Hey,

00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:31.906
would you mind if I looked
at that news report?

00:04:31.948 --> 00:04:33.241
[News Host] This footage
is from Shinjuku,

00:04:33.283 --> 00:04:34.868
taken just a few minutes ago.

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:36.578
As you can see all
electronic circuits

00:04:36.619 --> 00:04:38.038
-in the area appear
-Oh, looks like big trouble.

00:04:38.038 --> 00:04:40.373
Thanks. I better use mine.

00:04:40.373 --> 00:04:42.917
(lively music)

00:04:48.715 --> 00:04:53.053
Oh, sorry, um, this
is my timeline.

00:04:53.053 --> 00:04:54.554
It's connected to a lot

00:04:54.554 --> 00:04:57.432
of people who are experts in
all kinds of different fields.

00:04:57.474 --> 00:05:00.393
And because I'm connected
with them, I can ask questions

00:05:00.435 --> 00:05:03.772
and acquire whatever information
I might need to know.

00:05:03.813 --> 00:05:04.898
Amazing.

00:05:04.898 --> 00:05:06.107
Huh?

00:05:06.149 --> 00:05:09.611
I mean, I'm really bad
at that kind of stuff.

00:05:09.652 --> 00:05:11.071
You're incredible, Koshiro!

00:05:12.072 --> 00:05:13.239
(Koshiro sighs)

00:05:13.281 --> 00:05:15.450
Um, you can call me Izzy.

00:05:15.492 --> 00:05:16.910
I can see from the pattern

00:05:16.951 --> 00:05:19.621
that the way this is
spreading isn't normal.

00:05:19.662 --> 00:05:22.082
It's going to cause
a lot of trouble.

00:05:22.082 --> 00:05:24.751
It looks like the disruptions
are heading this way.

00:05:24.751 --> 00:05:26.586
It might get bad.

00:05:26.586 --> 00:05:28.922
Maybe I should stock up
on emergency supplies

00:05:28.963 --> 00:05:31.132
like water and batteries.

00:05:31.174 --> 00:05:32.300
Huh?

00:05:32.342 --> 00:05:33.635
Look at this.

00:05:33.676 --> 00:05:34.969
The trains are being affected.

00:05:35.011 --> 00:05:36.971
(cellphone dials)

00:05:37.013 --> 00:05:37.972
What?

00:05:38.014 --> 00:05:39.015
Oh, no!

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:42.310
[Train Tech] What's going
on? We're locked out!

00:05:42.352 --> 00:05:44.270
We can't manage the
speed or directions!

00:05:44.437 --> 00:05:46.773
[Izzy] The Tokyo loop
line has lost control

00:05:46.773 --> 00:05:48.274
and the trains won't stop.

00:05:48.274 --> 00:05:50.777
If this keeps up, they're
gonna crash into the barriers,

00:05:50.777 --> 00:05:53.988
go off the rails or start
colliding with each other.

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:55.323
(cellphone dials)

00:05:55.365 --> 00:05:56.533
What's going on, Tai?

00:05:57.826 --> 00:05:59.953
They said they were
transferring at Shibuya earlier.

00:05:59.994 --> 00:06:00.995
Huh?

00:06:02.122 --> 00:06:03.790
My mom and my little sister
might be on that train.

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:05.375
What, really?

00:06:06.459 --> 00:06:08.128
Shibuya you say, if we can get

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:10.338
on the express somehow,
we can be there

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:12.006
in 12 or 13 minutes.

00:06:13.049 --> 00:06:14.050
[Tai's mom] Hello? Tai?

00:06:14.968 --> 00:06:17.470
Sorry, I had it on silence
so I didn't hear the.

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:18.638
[Tai] Mom, where are you now?

00:06:18.638 --> 00:06:19.639
[Tai's mom] On the train.

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:20.640
Why are you so worried?

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:21.641
I've taken a train before.

00:06:21.641 --> 00:06:22.642
(Kari screams)

00:06:22.642 --> 00:06:25.311
(train rumbles)

00:06:25.311 --> 00:06:28.148
(controls beeps)

00:06:28.148 --> 00:06:29.149
[Tai] Hello?

00:06:29.149 --> 00:06:30.650
Mom, are you still there?

00:06:30.692 --> 00:06:31.651
Mom?

00:06:31.693 --> 00:06:32.819
Kari?

00:06:32.819 --> 00:06:36.197
(crowd chatters)

00:06:36.239 --> 00:06:37.532
[Izzy] The news says
there's a problem

00:06:37.574 --> 00:06:39.659
with all the
metropolitan train lines.

00:06:39.659 --> 00:06:40.660
[Kid] What's happening?

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:42.328
The loop line presents
an immediate danger

00:06:42.328 --> 00:06:44.205
to all passengers on-board.

00:06:44.247 --> 00:06:45.248
This is bad.

00:06:47.584 --> 00:06:49.002
They're on that train, huh?

00:06:50.837 --> 00:06:52.172
The roads aren't
fully functional,

00:06:52.213 --> 00:06:54.215
so we can't take a
car to go get them.

00:06:54.257 --> 00:06:55.508
What do we do?

00:06:55.508 --> 00:06:57.886
From here to Shibuya would
be at least 12 kilometers,

00:06:57.927 --> 00:07:00.180
even if we were able
to follow the tracks.

00:07:01.347 --> 00:07:03.183
[Ticket Operator] Hey,
you, What are you doing?

00:07:03.224 --> 00:07:04.184
Huh?

00:07:04.225 --> 00:07:07.187
(melancholy music)

00:07:28.291 --> 00:07:29.292
Tai!

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:32.795
(devices beep)

00:07:43.723 --> 00:07:44.766
[Izzy] Tai?

00:07:59.405 --> 00:08:00.782
Huh?

00:08:00.823 --> 00:08:03.284
(Tai groans)

00:08:12.585 --> 00:08:15.129
What the heck's going on here?

00:08:15.171 --> 00:08:16.297
Where am I?

00:08:17.423 --> 00:08:20.802
I heard someone calling
my name, and then.

00:09:23.239 --> 00:09:25.366
[Izzy] Something's
happening here?

00:09:25.408 --> 00:09:27.160
Something's strange.

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:29.495
It's an effect beyond
our understanding.

00:09:33.583 --> 00:09:35.043
Wait a minute.

00:09:35.084 --> 00:09:36.044
Uh.

00:09:36.085 --> 00:09:38.838
(device jingles)

00:10:21.881 --> 00:10:22.882
Hi.

00:10:25.927 --> 00:10:27.387
I'm Agumon.

00:10:28.638 --> 00:10:31.432
I finally found you Tai.

00:10:31.474 --> 00:10:32.475
Agumon?

00:10:33.893 --> 00:10:36.562
How do you know me
and what are you?

00:10:37.605 --> 00:10:39.065
Where are we?

00:10:39.065 --> 00:10:40.900
Hey, I have to be somewhere.

00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:44.904
My mom and sister are stuck
on this train and what's that?

00:10:54.664 --> 00:10:57.250
Don't worry, Tai, I got this.

00:10:57.250 --> 00:11:00.002
I'm gonna take these guys down.

00:11:12.098 --> 00:11:14.016
(Agumon growls)

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:17.019
(triumphant music)

00:11:20.773 --> 00:11:21.774
Pepper Breath!

00:11:35.037 --> 00:11:37.707
(Agumon groans)

00:11:45.798 --> 00:11:47.008
[Izzy] Tai, are you there?

00:11:47.049 --> 00:11:48.384
Please respond.

00:11:48.384 --> 00:11:50.845
This is Koshiro Izumi, Izzy.

00:11:50.887 --> 00:11:51.846
Huh?

00:11:51.888 --> 00:11:52.847
I hear you, Izzy.

00:11:52.889 --> 00:11:55.016
[Izzy] Whew! I'm glad
I got through to you.

00:11:55.057 --> 00:11:56.559
[Tai] Yeah, but from where?

00:11:56.642 --> 00:11:57.894
what's going on?

00:11:57.977 --> 00:11:59.896
Something weird is
happening to me right now.

00:11:59.896 --> 00:12:01.189
[Izzy] That's why I'm calling.

00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:04.066
I can see you over
here from my side.

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:06.027
From your side?

00:12:06.068 --> 00:12:07.236
-[Izzy] I've gotta tell you
-Izzy,

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:08.571
can you hold
on for a second?

00:12:08.654 --> 00:12:09.655
[Izzy] Oh, sure.

00:12:29.675 --> 00:12:30.927
[Agumon] Thank you, Tai.

00:12:30.927 --> 00:12:32.929
(Tai pants)

00:12:33.012 --> 00:12:34.013
[Tai] Anytime.

00:12:35.097 --> 00:12:37.266
All right, leave the rest to me.

00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:39.435
[Izzy] Tai, I need
to tell you something

00:12:39.435 --> 00:12:42.104
about where you are and I
don't want you to panic.

00:12:42.104 --> 00:12:44.607
Please listen and
keep an open mind.

00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:46.901
Somehow you've wound
up inside the Net.

00:12:46.943 --> 00:12:48.110
Huh?

00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:49.737
[Izzy] It's an
unbelievable world

00:12:49.779 --> 00:12:52.615
where everything is made up
of data that has a shape.

00:12:52.698 --> 00:12:55.952
Unfortunately, I think you're
probably being targeted

00:12:56.035 --> 00:12:57.912
by some of that data.

00:12:57.954 --> 00:12:59.580
I'm inside the Net?

00:12:59.622 --> 00:13:00.706
What?

00:13:00.748 --> 00:13:02.792
[Izzy] You have to be
cautious in your interactions

00:13:02.875 --> 00:13:05.294
with the life forms
inhabiting this world.

00:13:05.294 --> 00:13:07.630
I don't know what you're
going to encounter.

00:13:07.713 --> 00:13:09.799
This is all new!

00:13:09.799 --> 00:13:12.134
Pepper Breath!

00:13:20.142 --> 00:13:24.814
We are monsters that live
inside the digital world.

00:13:24.814 --> 00:13:26.566
We're called Digimon!

00:13:27.817 --> 00:13:28.818
Digimon?

00:13:29.986 --> 00:13:32.154
[Izzy] I can't believe
what's going on here, Tai.

00:13:33.739 --> 00:13:35.658
This device I'm holding
is the same thing

00:13:35.658 --> 00:13:36.993
that you have, correct?

00:13:38.077 --> 00:13:40.621
You disappeared from
the station in a flash.

00:13:40.663 --> 00:13:41.831
And when I looked down

00:13:41.914 --> 00:13:44.333
this thing suddenly
appeared in front of me.

00:13:44.417 --> 00:13:47.128
At the same time, my
screen started changing.

00:13:47.169 --> 00:13:49.463
All these new programs had
suddenly been installed.

00:13:49.505 --> 00:13:51.132
It's completely awesome!

00:13:51.173 --> 00:13:54.343
And more than that, I think
I'll be able to help you out.

00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:00.016
I'm seeing a lot of activity.

00:14:00.099 --> 00:14:01.517
Are the Digimon swarming?

00:14:02.935 --> 00:14:04.812
I believe they operate
in the same way

00:14:04.854 --> 00:14:07.648
as computer viruses
that attack data.

00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:09.358
[Agumon] A ton of them
suddenly popped up

00:14:09.358 --> 00:14:12.028
and started going
wild everywhere.

00:14:12.028 --> 00:14:13.821
[Izzy] But once
that swarm vanished,

00:14:13.863 --> 00:14:16.324
I was able to confirm
that one of the terminals

00:14:16.365 --> 00:14:19.201
in the transit grid had
returned to normal operations.

00:14:20.202 --> 00:14:21.871
That's all the proof we need.

00:14:21.954 --> 00:14:23.372
It's obvious to me now.

00:14:23.456 --> 00:14:25.166
The ones behind
the cyber attacks

00:14:25.207 --> 00:14:27.043
in Tokyo are these Digimon.

00:14:28.127 --> 00:14:30.546
No wonder the cause
couldn't be identified,

00:14:30.546 --> 00:14:32.673
the infection's
inside the Network.

00:14:32.715 --> 00:14:34.842
[Tai] Okay, what's the
status of the loop line?

00:14:34.884 --> 00:14:35.843
(keyboard clanks)

00:14:35.885 --> 00:14:36.886
(Izzy sighs)

00:14:36.969 --> 00:14:39.347
[Izzy] It looks like it's
still out of control.

00:14:39.388 --> 00:14:41.390
[Tai] So what do we do, Izzy?

00:14:41.474 --> 00:14:43.392
[Izzy] Hang on,
let me dig deeper.

00:14:43.476 --> 00:14:46.228
There's an area that manages
the loop line control system.

00:14:46.228 --> 00:14:48.397
I'm sure there must be
Digimon attacking it.

00:14:51.484 --> 00:14:52.902
I knew it.

00:14:52.902 --> 00:14:55.529
There are signs of Digimon
having corrupted the pathways.

00:14:55.571 --> 00:14:58.407
If you can take back the
area I'm pinpointing for you,

00:14:58.491 --> 00:15:00.868
the operators here should
be able to regain control

00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:02.411
and stop the train!

00:15:02.495 --> 00:15:05.081
Hey Tai, you're protecting
someone important

00:15:05.164 --> 00:15:06.582
to you, right?

00:15:06.582 --> 00:15:09.085
Okay, I'll put a
stop to this now.

00:15:09.085 --> 00:15:10.086
Agumon!

00:15:15.007 --> 00:15:16.342
Pepper Breath!

00:15:29.271 --> 00:15:31.732
Good work, one more.

00:15:31.774 --> 00:15:32.775
Huh?

00:15:34.944 --> 00:15:36.278
Something weird is happening.

00:15:36.362 --> 00:15:39.615
It looks like all of the
data near that last Digimon,

00:15:39.615 --> 00:15:42.785
is gathering, and focusing
its energy on one place!

00:15:53.963 --> 00:15:56.632
(Agumon growls)

00:15:58.718 --> 00:15:59.719
Agumon!

00:16:02.888 --> 00:16:03.889
Talk to me!

00:16:05.224 --> 00:16:06.308
[Tai] That was close.

00:16:08.644 --> 00:16:09.603
Agumon!

00:16:09.645 --> 00:16:10.771
[Izzy] Be careful everybody.

00:16:10.813 --> 00:16:12.273
From what I can tell,

00:16:12.314 --> 00:16:15.484
the structure of that last
Digimon is changing rapidly.

00:16:15.568 --> 00:16:17.486
I don't know exactly
what's happening there,

00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:19.655
but you may wanna keep
your distance, Tai.

00:16:32.168 --> 00:16:34.962
Tai, it digivolved.

00:16:35.004 --> 00:16:37.006
[Tai] Huh, digivolved?

00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:46.682
[Izzy] This is part
of their structure.

00:16:46.766 --> 00:16:49.769
It's the Digimon's
form of evolution.

00:16:51.437 --> 00:16:55.691
Ugh, the loop line situation
is changing for the worse.

00:16:55.775 --> 00:16:58.819
One of the out of control
trains has started to speed up.

00:16:58.861 --> 00:17:01.614
It's getting close to ramming
the train in front of it!

00:17:02.865 --> 00:17:04.033
This is bad, Tai.

00:17:04.116 --> 00:17:06.494
At this rate, the trains
will collide at any moment.

00:17:06.535 --> 00:17:08.829
It's going to become
a major accident.

00:17:08.871 --> 00:17:11.540
(Agumon groans)

00:17:15.711 --> 00:17:16.879
Agumon?

00:17:17.046 --> 00:17:18.047
Agumon!

00:17:29.308 --> 00:17:32.228
(triumphant music)

00:17:47.993 --> 00:17:51.330
[Izzy] Is it happening
to Agumon, too?

00:17:55.918 --> 00:17:58.504
(Agumon roars)

00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:09.849
Agumon, digivolve to.

00:18:34.957 --> 00:18:39.044
Greymon!

00:18:54.643 --> 00:18:56.061
[Tai] Greymon?

00:18:58.564 --> 00:18:59.565
Tai.

00:19:02.985 --> 00:19:03.986
Hmm.

00:19:07.239 --> 00:19:09.575
[Izzy] Tai, Greymon,
you've gotta hurry,

00:19:09.575 --> 00:19:11.327
there's no time left!

00:19:29.011 --> 00:19:30.262
Are you ready for this?

00:20:37.913 --> 00:20:40.416
Nova Blast!

00:21:07.526 --> 00:21:10.237
[Izzy] The emergency stop
program has been activated

00:21:10.279 --> 00:21:12.239
on all loop line trains.

00:21:12.281 --> 00:21:14.074
The collisions
have been avoided.

00:21:14.116 --> 00:21:15.534
Tai, we pulled it off.

00:21:16.035 --> 00:21:17.036
[Tai] You're right.

00:21:17.036 --> 00:21:18.537
I can't believe it.

00:21:19.538 --> 00:21:20.539
That was amazing.

00:21:21.790 --> 00:21:22.750
Thanks a lot.

00:21:22.791 --> 00:21:24.043
You're the best, Izzy.

00:21:32.885 --> 00:21:34.386
And thank you, Greymon.

00:21:35.804 --> 00:21:36.805
Sure.

00:21:41.393 --> 00:21:42.561
[Izzy] What?

00:21:42.561 --> 00:21:45.564
[Izzy] Tai, I'm picking up
signs of another cyber attack.

00:21:45.564 --> 00:21:47.274
No, it's another Digimon attack,

00:21:47.316 --> 00:21:48.776
but it's not happening in Japan.

00:21:48.817 --> 00:21:51.612
This time, it's in
the United States.

00:21:51.653 --> 00:21:52.905
It looks like they're targeting

00:21:52.905 --> 00:21:55.240
the American military's
tactical data network.

00:21:56.408 --> 00:21:57.910
We have to stop them!

00:21:57.910 --> 00:22:00.412
Otherwise, the Digimon
could easily take control

00:22:00.412 --> 00:22:02.289
of any of their weapons.

00:22:02.331 --> 00:22:05.292
If that happens, it could
lead to all out war!

00:22:05.334 --> 00:22:08.253
It would mean the
end of the world!

The only ones who
can stop the attack

00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:17.322
on America are Tai and Agumon.

00:23:17.322 --> 00:23:20.534
[Tai] Next time, on Digimon
Adventure, War Game.

[Narrator] The adventure
continues in a new world.
