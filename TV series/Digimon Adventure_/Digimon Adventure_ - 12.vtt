00:00:04.275 --> 00:00:06.235
(mystical music)

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:17.747
[Izzy] Next up on the
Digimon Encyclopedia is

00:00:17.747 --> 00:00:18.998
Palmon!

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.584
This Digimon is Mimi's partner.

00:00:21.626 --> 00:00:24.253
The flower on Palmon's
head and the leaf-like arms

00:00:24.253 --> 00:00:26.756
allow for photosynthesis.

00:00:26.756 --> 00:00:27.966
Now let's check this out!

00:00:29.467 --> 00:00:31.177
The flower changes
scent depending on

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:32.220
how Palmon's feeling.

00:00:33.054 --> 00:00:34.931
I'm curious to know
how different it smells

00:00:34.973 --> 00:00:37.475
when Palmon is happy or angry!

00:00:38.476 --> 00:00:41.187
(heroic music)

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:43.648
Which Digimon will
it be next time?

00:00:45.775 --> 00:00:46.776

[Narrator] To avoid
going through the dark

00:02:12.293 --> 00:02:15.171
miasma-filled swamp,
the Digi-destined

00:02:15.212 --> 00:02:18.049
decide to split
up into two teams.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.803
Along the way, Matt's
team encounters Neemon

00:02:22.803 --> 00:02:25.806
and a group of Digimon who are
trying to escape the desert

00:02:25.806 --> 00:02:28.142
dominated by the Scorpiomon.

00:02:30.227 --> 00:02:32.188
In order to defeat Scorpiomon

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:34.023
and clear the path forward,

00:02:34.065 --> 00:02:37.234
Garurumon digivolves
to Weregarurumon.

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.159
Meanwhile, Tai and his team...

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:47.828
-(stone creaking)
-(Mimi and Palmon gasping)

00:02:47.828 --> 00:02:51.499
(Mimi and Palmon screaming)

00:02:57.004 --> 00:02:59.340
[Mimi] I think I'm
still seeing stars.

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.800
Mimi, please.

00:03:00.841 --> 00:03:02.510
Was that some kind
of booby trap?

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:03.636
You're crushing me.

00:03:03.678 --> 00:03:05.304
Oh, sorry, Palmon!

00:03:05.346 --> 00:03:09.475
-(Palmon groaning)
-(Mimi gasping)

00:03:09.517 --> 00:03:11.018
[Mimi] Hey, Tai!

00:03:11.018 --> 00:03:12.353
Izzy!

00:03:12.353 --> 00:03:13.688
Can you hear me?

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:16.899
Let's see if this works.

00:03:16.941 --> 00:03:19.777
(Palmon grunting)

00:03:26.033 --> 00:03:27.868
(Palmon sighing sadly)

00:03:27.868 --> 00:03:30.621
It's too high up
for me to reach.

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:34.542
Let's go that way.

00:03:34.542 --> 00:03:37.086
There's gotta be an
exit somewhere nearby.

00:03:37.128 --> 00:03:40.589
(footsteps tapping)

00:03:40.631 --> 00:03:43.759
(wings flapping)

00:03:43.801 --> 00:03:47.013
(tense music)

00:03:47.054 --> 00:03:48.389
Mimi!

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:50.016
Hey, Palmon!

00:03:50.057 --> 00:03:52.393
Can you hear us down there?

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:54.770
Why won't it work?

00:03:54.812 --> 00:03:57.732
This place is interfering
with all of our devices.

00:03:57.732 --> 00:04:00.192
I think these symbols I
took photos of earlier

00:04:00.234 --> 00:04:02.945
hold information
about this ruin.

00:04:02.987 --> 00:04:05.406
They could tell us how
to find Mimi and Palmon.

00:04:05.406 --> 00:04:07.408
-(static hissing)
-Ah!

00:04:07.408 --> 00:04:08.617
See, I told you!

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:11.912
Even my computer is acting up.

00:04:11.912 --> 00:04:12.955
Ah!

00:04:12.997 --> 00:04:14.290
Looks like it's working!

00:04:14.331 --> 00:04:17.168
(monitor beeping)

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:19.879
No way, check it out!

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.422
This is all right below us.

00:04:21.422 --> 00:04:23.549
It looks like an
ancient weapons factory!

00:04:23.591 --> 00:04:25.259
A weapons factory?

00:04:26.343 --> 00:04:28.971
I've got a bad
feeling about this.

00:04:29.013 --> 00:04:31.515
(tense music)

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.439
(sonar beeping)

00:04:42.276 --> 00:04:45.404
(tense music)

00:04:45.446 --> 00:04:48.866
(scrap metal clattering)

00:04:52.953 --> 00:04:55.623
[Palmon] Where are we?

00:04:55.623 --> 00:04:58.834
It looks like a junkyard
for scrap metal.

00:04:58.876 --> 00:05:01.170
[Palmon] What's "scrap?"

00:05:01.212 --> 00:05:05.132
(Palmon groaning anxiously)

00:05:05.132 --> 00:05:06.634
(both gasping)

00:05:06.634 --> 00:05:07.760
(metal clanging)

00:05:07.802 --> 00:05:08.969
Hold on a sec.

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:10.054
These are all

00:05:11.138 --> 00:05:12.139
Digimon!

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.982
(Mimi gasping)

00:05:21.982 --> 00:05:24.026
This one is covered in dust.

00:05:24.068 --> 00:05:25.319
You poor thing.

00:05:30.157 --> 00:05:31.700
Let's keep going, Palmon.

00:05:31.742 --> 00:05:34.328
(Mimi gasping)

00:05:38.332 --> 00:05:41.669
Oh, I guess we must have
intruded, we're so sorry!

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:44.713
Anyway, you wouldn't
happen to know a way

00:05:44.755 --> 00:05:47.508
to get back to the surface
from here, would you?

00:05:47.508 --> 00:05:49.510
We fell down a crazy trap

00:05:49.552 --> 00:05:51.011
and got split up
from our friends,

00:05:51.011 --> 00:05:53.180
who are probably
worried about us.

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:54.890
Can you help?

00:05:54.932 --> 00:05:57.351
Enemy target confirmed.

00:05:57.351 --> 00:05:58.519
Huh?

00:05:58.519 --> 00:06:01.272
(metal creaking)

00:06:02.356 --> 00:06:04.650
Eliminate target.

00:06:04.692 --> 00:06:06.694
(Mimi gasping)

00:06:06.694 --> 00:06:09.905
-(metal slamming)
-Look out!

00:06:09.947 --> 00:06:12.741
(tense music)

00:06:12.783 --> 00:06:14.577
What is the deal with this guy?

00:06:14.618 --> 00:06:16.370
Beats the leaf out of me!

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:19.874
(Mimi grunting in determination)

00:06:19.874 --> 00:06:22.334
Palmon digivolve to

00:06:22.376 --> 00:06:25.129
(dramatic music)

00:06:27.298 --> 00:06:28.299
Togemon!

00:06:31.552 --> 00:06:32.636
Needle Spray!

00:06:33.554 --> 00:06:36.265
(needles clanging)

00:06:36.307 --> 00:06:37.766
(Mimi gasping)

00:06:37.808 --> 00:06:39.393
Eliminate target.

00:06:40.811 --> 00:06:41.770
(Mimi whimpering)

00:06:41.812 --> 00:06:43.105
Don't worry, Mimi.

00:06:43.147 --> 00:06:45.941
I'll protect you no matter what!

00:06:45.983 --> 00:06:47.610
(Andromon whirring)

00:06:47.651 --> 00:06:50.571
(Togemon grunting)

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:55.784
(Togemon screaming)

00:06:55.826 --> 00:06:57.077
Are you okay?

00:06:58.412 --> 00:06:59.747
(Palmon thudding)

00:06:59.747 --> 00:07:02.333
(Mimi panting)

00:07:03.167 --> 00:07:04.752
Eliminate target.

00:07:07.254 --> 00:07:09.131
(Mimi gasping)

00:07:09.173 --> 00:07:12.092
-(Andromon whirring)
-(Mimi whimpering)

00:07:12.092 --> 00:07:14.845
(metal clanging)

00:07:17.264 --> 00:07:19.850
(Mimi gasping)

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:24.396
What happened?

00:07:24.438 --> 00:07:29.443
-(triumphant music)
-(ground rumbling)

00:07:33.113 --> 00:07:35.699
(Mimi gasping)

00:07:37.117 --> 00:07:40.037
(triumphant music)

00:07:44.792 --> 00:07:47.378
(Mimi gasping)

00:07:48.712 --> 00:07:50.130
State your business here,

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:53.384
Guardromon number
two-zero-seven-eight.

00:07:54.635 --> 00:07:57.554
(triumphant music)

00:08:14.321 --> 00:08:17.157
(steam hissing)

00:08:17.157 --> 00:08:18.659
You protected us.

00:08:18.659 --> 00:08:20.536
Are you on our side, then?

00:08:20.577 --> 00:08:23.539
(steam hissing)

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:26.166
(Guardromon clanking)

00:08:26.166 --> 00:08:29.169
(torpedo whooshing)

00:08:32.339 --> 00:08:34.925
Where are you aiming with that?

00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:39.555
(torpedo exploding)

00:08:39.596 --> 00:08:42.641
(metal crashing)

00:08:42.683 --> 00:08:45.352
(rockets roaring)

00:08:48.355 --> 00:08:50.024
(Mimi gasping)

00:08:50.024 --> 00:08:52.234
(steam hissing)

00:08:52.276 --> 00:08:55.112
(rockets roaring)

00:08:59.867 --> 00:09:02.036
Palmon, you hang in there!

00:09:02.036 --> 00:09:04.538
(Palmon groaning)

00:09:04.538 --> 00:09:06.582
What am I supposed to do?

00:09:06.623 --> 00:09:09.293
(steam hissing)

00:09:11.462 --> 00:09:13.422
(Agumon grunting)

00:09:13.464 --> 00:09:15.382
(Agumon yelping)

00:09:15.382 --> 00:09:16.383
Agumon, what happened?

00:09:16.383 --> 00:09:17.384
You okay?

00:09:17.384 --> 00:09:19.094
Yeah, just slipped is all.

00:09:19.136 --> 00:09:20.387
I've got more news.

00:09:20.387 --> 00:09:22.264
This hole goes
down a lot further.

00:09:22.306 --> 00:09:23.849
[Tentomon] Be careful, you two!

00:09:23.891 --> 00:09:26.393
(Tai yelping)

00:09:28.062 --> 00:09:31.273
Hold on, Mimi, we're coming!

00:09:31.315 --> 00:09:34.068
(water dripping)

00:09:35.319 --> 00:09:38.489
(Guardromon clanking)

00:09:39.656 --> 00:09:41.825
[Mimi] Now where are we?

00:09:45.245 --> 00:09:48.749
(water splashing)

00:09:48.749 --> 00:09:51.335
(somber music)

00:09:59.843 --> 00:10:04.848
-(steam hissing)
-(Guardromon creaking)

00:10:05.516 --> 00:10:06.517
Huh?

00:10:08.685 --> 00:10:10.145
Is that for me?

00:10:10.187 --> 00:10:11.814
(steam hissing)

00:10:11.855 --> 00:10:12.856
Really?

00:10:14.024 --> 00:10:15.651
How sweet of you.

00:10:15.692 --> 00:10:17.611
(steam hissing)

00:10:17.611 --> 00:10:20.280
(Mimi giggling)

00:10:21.448 --> 00:10:24.118
(steam hissing)

00:10:24.159 --> 00:10:26.412
By the way, do you know if
there's some kind of way

00:10:26.453 --> 00:10:28.497

00:20:38.023 --> 00:20:40.692
(cannon firing)

00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:45.196
(shots exploding)

00:20:47.198 --> 00:20:50.076
(Andromon grunting)

00:20:50.118 --> 00:20:51.202
What have I

00:20:53.038 --> 00:20:54.039
been...

00:20:58.126 --> 00:21:00.712
(Mimi gasping)

00:21:09.054 --> 00:21:10.680
Mimi...

00:21:10.722 --> 00:21:13.558
(Mimi whimpering)

00:21:15.477 --> 00:21:18.063
(Mimi sobbing)

00:21:28.156 --> 00:21:30.492
(sad music)

00:21:31.910 --> 00:21:36.247
Mimi was helped by a machine
Digimon named Guardromon.

00:21:36.247 --> 00:21:38.541
According to the
data that I saw,

00:21:38.583 --> 00:21:40.460
he was friends with Andromon.

00:21:40.502 --> 00:21:43.421
Andromon was manipulated
into doing this.

00:21:43.421 --> 00:21:46.674
(Agumon sighing sadly)

00:21:48.343 --> 00:21:50.470
Are you okay now, Mimi?

00:21:50.512 --> 00:21:51.971
Yeah.

00:21:52.013 --> 00:21:56.768

bad guys as soon as possible.
