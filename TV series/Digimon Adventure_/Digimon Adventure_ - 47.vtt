[Narrator] This is
the mysterious world

00:01:41.521 --> 00:01:44.457
where Digimon live,
the Digital World.

00:01:45.658 --> 00:01:48.495
Tai, Kari, and the other
Digi-destined children

00:01:48.528 --> 00:01:51.698
mysteriously found themselves
here from the human world.

00:01:52.866 --> 00:01:55.101
Upon arriving, they
met the Digimon

00:01:55.135 --> 00:01:58.538
that would soon become their
dependable Digimon partners.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.510
Working together, they're now
on a life changing journey

00:02:03.543 --> 00:02:06.045
to save The Digital
World and their own.

00:02:08.381 --> 00:02:12.685
Long ago, a war broke out
between light and darkness

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:13.820
in the Digital World.

00:02:15.522 --> 00:02:18.825
Millenniumon, the bringer
of destruction and darkness

00:02:18.858 --> 00:02:22.896
born from that war, is about
to make his return once again.

00:02:25.331 --> 00:02:26.299
To prevent this,

00:02:26.332 --> 00:02:29.035
the Digi-destined
must find the Digimon

00:02:29.068 --> 00:02:31.538
who are attempting to
revive Millenniumon

00:02:31.571 --> 00:02:33.239
at the Sealed Grounds.

00:02:34.574 --> 00:02:35.875
The children were attacked

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:38.344
by an eerie sphere
named Sakkakumon.

00:02:39.746 --> 00:02:42.048
The Digi-destined who
got trapped inside

00:02:42.081 --> 00:02:43.716
were overwhelmed by attacks

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.219
from various familiar
Digimon data.

00:02:50.256 --> 00:02:54.194
Thankfully, Angemon
digivolved into MagnaAngemon.

00:02:56.362 --> 00:02:59.232
Whose beaming, glowing
sword opened a path

00:02:59.265 --> 00:03:01.434
that allowed them to
escape the danger.

00:03:03.903 --> 00:03:07.106
One night, during
their fateful journey.

00:03:14.614 --> 00:03:15.615
Tai, you there?

00:03:19.285 --> 00:03:21.855
(Tai yawns)

00:03:21.888 --> 00:03:23.957
Where these two
run off to so late?

00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.192
Just follow me.

00:03:26.226 --> 00:03:27.894
I can track Gomamon
and Joe's scent

00:03:27.927 --> 00:03:29.262
and it's leading this way.

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:31.197
(Joe screams)

00:03:31.231 --> 00:03:33.933
(Tai and Agumon startle)

00:03:33.967 --> 00:03:37.203
(Tyrannomon roars)

00:03:37.237 --> 00:03:40.473
(Atamadekachimon roars)

00:03:43.943 --> 00:03:46.112
What's going on here?

00:03:46.145 --> 00:03:49.115
(mysterious music)

00:03:51.417 --> 00:03:52.418
A faucet?

00:03:57.757 --> 00:03:59.559
I wonder if this was over here

00:03:59.592 --> 00:04:02.295
or if it's a recreation
from our world's data.

00:04:04.998 --> 00:04:07.333
Weird, so where's
Joe and Gomamon?

00:04:09.502 --> 00:04:12.305
Unfortunately, they
were taken away.

00:04:16.342 --> 00:04:19.445
Ah, another Digimon
with a human, eh?

00:04:20.947 --> 00:04:23.917
Would you guys happen to be
friends with that wimpy human

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.253
and the small white Digimon
that was traveling with him?

00:04:27.287 --> 00:04:30.823
Yeah, so then you must
have seen Joe and Gomamon!

00:04:30.857 --> 00:04:34.460
Did you happen to notice which
direction they were taken?

00:04:34.494 --> 00:04:35.495
Both ways.

00:04:35.528 --> 00:04:36.996
(arm cracks)

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:39.265
(Agumon and Tai gasps)

00:04:39.299 --> 00:04:43.436
Oops. It's nothing new,
don't worry about me.

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:46.673
The wimp was taken that way
and the white one, that way.

00:04:46.706 --> 00:04:48.808
Since they were
taken separately.

00:04:48.841 --> 00:04:50.810
Got it! Thanks for the help.

00:04:50.843 --> 00:04:52.345
I'll go and rescue Joe

00:04:52.378 --> 00:04:53.780
and you take care of Gomamon.

00:04:53.813 --> 00:04:55.949
We'll all meet back
here once we save them.

00:04:55.982 --> 00:04:58.651
(Agumon grunts)

00:05:00.019 --> 00:05:01.020
Wait.

00:05:02.455 --> 00:05:04.123
Are you able to track him down

00:05:04.157 --> 00:05:06.159
using your nose
like your partner?

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.528
Nope.

00:05:08.561 --> 00:05:10.997
I was just gonna go
the way you told me.

00:05:12.231 --> 00:05:15.635
You don't have a tail and
you sure can't breathe fire,

00:05:15.668 --> 00:05:18.838
so how is it you intend on
saving your friend, human?

00:05:19.739 --> 00:05:21.474
When you say it like that.

00:05:21.507 --> 00:05:24.210
[Nohemon] At least let
me guide you there.

00:05:24.243 --> 00:05:25.244
Come along.

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:28.314
That'd be awesome!

00:05:28.348 --> 00:05:30.516
But I'm not just
any regular kid.

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:32.385
I'm the one and only Tai Kamiya!

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:39.158
[Nohemon] Well, I'm Nohemon
and I'm the guardian of water.

00:05:39.192 --> 00:05:41.694
Water? You mean that
faucet back there?

00:05:43.096 --> 00:05:46.899
That faucet is the only water
source around here for miles

00:05:46.933 --> 00:05:49.869
and the villains trying to
take over that water source

00:05:49.902 --> 00:05:51.738
are absolutely relentless.

00:05:52.705 --> 00:05:55.074
Sadly, your foolish friends

00:05:55.108 --> 00:05:57.076
got themselves
tangled in their feud

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:59.078
while trying to get some water.

00:05:59.112 --> 00:06:01.414
There are two groups
fighting over the water

00:06:01.447 --> 00:06:03.783
and they each captured
one of your friends.

00:06:05.718 --> 00:06:09.088
Those two have been fighting
over who controls the water

00:06:09.122 --> 00:06:11.924
for as long as I can remember.

00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:14.961
(Tyrannomon growls)

00:06:17.563 --> 00:06:20.466
(Gomamon whimpers)

00:06:21.901 --> 00:06:24.871
As they always have, they
bickered back and forth

00:06:24.904 --> 00:06:28.107
as to who would punish the
outsider that touched the water.

00:06:28.141 --> 00:06:30.209
The compromise they
ended up coming to

00:06:30.243 --> 00:06:32.078
was taking them back separately.

00:06:37.483 --> 00:06:40.053
Had you shown up just
a few seconds earlier

00:06:40.086 --> 00:06:42.055
you might've been
able to stop them.

00:06:42.088 --> 00:06:43.122
It's a shame really.

00:07:00.106 --> 00:07:01.641
Let's keep going.

00:07:01.674 --> 00:07:03.034
[Tai] Yeah.

00:07:09.248 --> 00:07:12.819
So this must be one of the
villain secret hideouts, huh?

00:07:12.852 --> 00:07:14.053
[Nohemon] That's right.

00:07:14.087 --> 00:07:16.489
I can see Joe tied
up down there.

00:07:16.522 --> 00:07:19.559
(Digivice rings)

00:07:19.592 --> 00:07:21.427
I think I found Gomamon.

00:07:24.597 --> 00:07:27.500
His scent trail leads
into this big cave.

00:07:27.533 --> 00:07:29.669
Guess I'm going in then.

00:07:29.702 --> 00:07:31.504
Nice, just be careful in there.

00:07:31.537 --> 00:07:32.538
[Agumon] You too.

00:07:33.239 --> 00:07:34.240
Hey, Nohemon.

00:07:35.241 --> 00:07:36.676
Thanks for guiding me and all

00:07:36.709 --> 00:07:38.845
but I can take care
of things from here.

00:07:38.878 --> 00:07:41.080
Agumon and I can
handle these guys.

00:07:41.114 --> 00:07:42.682
Huh?

00:07:42.715 --> 00:07:45.184
Well, we can't let these
villains hog all the water

00:07:45.218 --> 00:07:47.620
so we are gonna teach
'em a lesson or two.

00:07:49.288 --> 00:07:50.690
Hey!

00:07:50.723 --> 00:07:52.692
Once we do that,
everyone will be able

00:07:52.725 --> 00:07:54.193
to use the water again.

00:07:54.227 --> 00:07:55.228
Later.

00:08:05.438 --> 00:08:07.473
How did I get myself
into this mess?

00:08:08.641 --> 00:08:11.043
[Gomamon] This way, I
can smell the water.

00:08:11.077 --> 00:08:12.712
It's just over here.

00:08:12.745 --> 00:08:15.882
(sparkling buzzing)

00:08:15.915 --> 00:08:16.916
(Joe gulps)

00:08:18.151 --> 00:08:20.052
[Joe] I can't believe
there's water out here.

00:08:20.086 --> 00:08:21.087
This is amazing.

00:08:22.288 --> 00:08:23.956
[Gomamon] I told
you I smelled water.

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:26.626
I just can't believe
there's so much of it.

00:08:26.659 --> 00:08:29.595
[Joe] Ah, so refreshing.

00:08:29.629 --> 00:08:30.630
Wait.

00:08:33.766 --> 00:08:36.335
(Joe whimpers)

00:08:39.438 --> 00:08:40.406
Listen, brutes!

00:08:40.439 --> 00:08:42.375
Don't think for a second
you're getting away

00:08:42.408 --> 00:08:43.910
with such a wrongful arrest.

00:08:43.943 --> 00:08:46.579
I get a phone call, don't I?
Somebody call my lawyer.

00:08:46.612 --> 00:08:47.980
(Tyrannomon roars)

00:08:48.014 --> 00:08:50.650
Ah! Forget it, I
think he's busy.

00:08:52.185 --> 00:08:54.654
[Tyrannomon] Have at him.

00:08:54.687 --> 00:08:57.123
(Joe screams)

00:08:57.156 --> 00:08:59.792
(quirky music)

00:09:05.865 --> 00:09:07.433
[MiniDekachimon] The problem is,

00:09:07.466 --> 00:09:09.468
that water you were
enjoying back there

00:09:09.502 --> 00:09:12.171
with that wimpy friend
of yours is ours.

00:09:13.306 --> 00:09:15.341
Can you really claim
that something is yours

00:09:15.374 --> 00:09:18.311
if you didn't even have your
name on it to begin with?

00:09:18.344 --> 00:09:19.312
[MiniDekachimon] Huh?

00:09:19.345 --> 00:09:21.247
Also your previous claim

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:22.682
that the water belongs to you

00:09:22.715 --> 00:09:24.450
raises some other concerns.

00:09:24.483 --> 00:09:28.354
I mean, isn't that an unlawful
monopoly of public property?

00:09:28.387 --> 00:09:30.523
Oh, I sound just like Joe.

00:09:30.556 --> 00:09:32.124
Not bad, uh?

00:09:32.158 --> 00:09:34.327
[MiniDekachimon] What the
heck are you talking about?

00:09:36.329 --> 00:09:38.497
Walking in through the
creek (indistinct).

00:09:39.899 --> 00:09:42.235
Hi! Don't mind me,
just passing through.

00:09:59.185 --> 00:10:01.921
(Goblimon roars)

00:10:08.728 --> 00:10:10.763
You let your guard down, Tai.

00:10:12.098 --> 00:10:13.366
You got that right.

00:10:18.704 --> 00:10:21.574
Thanks Nohemon, but
why'd you save me?

00:10:21.607 --> 00:10:25.011
Originally, the place
we first crossed paths

00:10:25.044 --> 00:10:27.780
used to be a peaceful one
with just an ordinary well.

00:10:29.749 --> 00:10:31.250
Everybody gathered there

00:10:31.284 --> 00:10:34.120
and was allowed to drink the
water whenever they pleased.

00:10:35.454 --> 00:10:36.455
However.

00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:40.026
(lighting strikes)

00:10:40.059 --> 00:10:42.728
(energy buzzing)

00:10:43.963 --> 00:10:46.098
That all changed when
the villain showed up

00:10:46.132 --> 00:10:48.234
and wanted it for themselves.

00:10:48.267 --> 00:10:51.570
They fought viciously
over control of it.

00:10:51.604 --> 00:10:53.739
Well, I stood up
to those villains.

00:11:04.417 --> 00:11:07.119
Ever since then the Digimon
who used to live around there

00:11:07.153 --> 00:11:08.154
have run off.

00:11:09.322 --> 00:11:11.957
Even the guardian of water
is one step out the door

00:11:11.991 --> 00:11:13.259
given the shape he's in.

00:11:15.795 --> 00:11:18.064
Even so, I haven't fallen so low

00:11:18.097 --> 00:11:20.933
that I would let some
human kid go off on his own

00:11:20.966 --> 00:11:24.070
to recklessly fight
an unwinnable battle.

00:11:24.103 --> 00:11:25.905
So I'll tag along.

00:11:25.938 --> 00:11:27.006
Now, we're talking.

00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:29.909
What's up with this guy.

00:11:29.942 --> 00:11:32.912
He's beating himself
up on his own.

00:11:32.945 --> 00:11:34.747
(Joe whimpers)

00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:36.982
But that's not enough
for what you did.

00:11:37.016 --> 00:11:39.618
First, you touched our
water without permission

00:11:39.652 --> 00:11:41.987
and then you completely
wrecked our hideout.

00:11:42.021 --> 00:11:43.823
You deserve worse.

00:11:43.856 --> 00:11:45.491
Prepare for punishment.

00:11:45.524 --> 00:11:46.525
That's enough!

00:11:49.362 --> 00:11:50.930
Joe, it's me, Tai.

00:11:50.963 --> 00:11:52.198
I came to save you.

00:11:53.866 --> 00:11:55.134
What? Who said that?

00:11:55.968 --> 00:11:57.470
Where are you, huh?

00:11:57.503 --> 00:11:58.471
[Tai] Up here.

00:11:58.504 --> 00:12:01.173
(frantic music)

00:12:16.889 --> 00:12:20.693
Quit standing around,
put out the fire.

00:12:20.726 --> 00:12:21.694
What are you doing?

00:12:21.727 --> 00:12:24.029
Put it out! Put it out!

00:12:24.063 --> 00:12:25.030
Wait a second.

00:12:25.064 --> 00:12:26.866
You mean that's their boss?

00:12:26.899 --> 00:12:30.870
He sure is. Gaossmon
practically runs this place.

00:12:30.903 --> 00:12:32.338
Now's our chance while
they're distracted!

00:12:32.371 --> 00:12:33.372
Wait.

00:12:38.911 --> 00:12:40.713
(Tyrannomon roars)

00:12:40.746 --> 00:12:43.749
(Joe and Tai scream)

00:12:55.928 --> 00:13:00.366
That's Tyrannomon,
Gaossmon's sworn brother.

00:13:00.399 --> 00:13:03.736
Tyranomon's digivolution
has surpassed Gaossmon,

00:13:03.769 --> 00:13:06.572
but even so he still
obeys his every command.

00:13:08.707 --> 00:13:11.210
(Joe screams)

00:13:13.078 --> 00:13:15.214
(Joe gasps)

00:13:15.247 --> 00:13:16.682
(Tyranomon roars)

00:13:16.715 --> 00:13:19.452
Quit moving around on your
own before you hurt yourself.

00:13:33.299 --> 00:13:35.701
I can do it, just
teach me how to shoot.

00:13:35.734 --> 00:13:36.735
What?

00:13:40.573 --> 00:13:44.777
Take a deep breath and
calm down there, bro.

00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:45.778
Nohemon?

00:13:45.811 --> 00:13:47.713
So you are the one behind this.

00:13:47.746 --> 00:13:49.315
All right, bro. Get him.

00:13:57.923 --> 00:14:00.326
No, you have to aim
for the water jug.

00:14:05.164 --> 00:14:08.300
Focus hard, but don't
hold your breath.

00:14:08.334 --> 00:14:10.936
Take long, deep breaths instead.

00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:14.106
(Tai breaths deeply)

00:14:17.943 --> 00:14:20.346
Listen, shoot the
moment you exhale!

00:14:24.183 --> 00:14:26.785
(arrow flying)

00:14:29.522 --> 00:14:31.924
(loud explosion)

00:14:31.957 --> 00:14:34.860
(Gaossmon screams)

00:14:36.128 --> 00:14:37.096
Sweet.

00:14:37.129 --> 00:14:38.998
Nice aim kid.

00:14:39.031 --> 00:14:40.032
Joe!

00:14:41.333 --> 00:14:44.003
(steam blowing)

00:14:49.375 --> 00:14:50.709
Thank you Tai.

00:14:56.815 --> 00:14:58.517
Don't let those three escape.

00:14:58.551 --> 00:15:00.352
Go after them.

00:15:00.386 --> 00:15:03.122
(Agumon whimpers)

00:15:03.155 --> 00:15:04.723
[Agumon] Gomamon!

00:15:06.058 --> 00:15:07.059
Agumon!

00:15:07.993 --> 00:15:09.528
Where do all these Digimon

00:15:09.562 --> 00:15:10.996
keep coming from?

00:15:13.232 --> 00:15:16.035
(Agumon screams)

00:15:20.506 --> 00:15:21.840
Pepper Breath!

00:15:29.915 --> 00:15:32.017
Hey Gomamon, where are you?

00:15:32.051 --> 00:15:34.353
[Gomamon] I'm right here.

00:15:36.021 --> 00:15:38.223
Oh, okay. I don't really
know what's going on,

00:15:38.257 --> 00:15:39.825
but let's get outta here.

00:15:39.858 --> 00:15:42.061
I don't know what's
happening either.

00:15:42.094 --> 00:15:43.429
Marching Fishes!

00:15:47.366 --> 00:15:49.201
[Agumon] Go fishies, go!

00:15:49.234 --> 00:15:50.903
We're not about
to let you twerps

00:15:50.936 --> 00:15:53.205
escape from us that easily!

00:15:56.075 --> 00:16:00.045
(Tai and Joe screams)

00:16:00.079 --> 00:16:01.080
[Gaossmon] Get back here!

00:16:01.113 --> 00:16:04.049
Quit running away you cowards!

00:16:04.083 --> 00:16:06.685
[Nohemon] Hey, kid!
Hate to break it to you

00:16:06.719 --> 00:16:08.687
but this doesn't look too good.

00:16:08.721 --> 00:16:10.756
Hey Agumon, how's your side?

00:16:10.789 --> 00:16:12.224
[Agumon] Well, it's
a little bruise,

00:16:12.257 --> 00:16:13.425
but thanks for asking.

00:16:13.459 --> 00:16:14.585
[MiniDekachimon] After them!

00:16:18.097 --> 00:16:19.765
Can you lead the
Digimon chasing you

00:16:19.798 --> 00:16:21.600
to the faucet we found earlier?

00:16:21.634 --> 00:16:22.968
[Agumon] Okay!

00:16:26.438 --> 00:16:27.606
There they are!

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:28.874
Tai, we did it!

00:16:28.907 --> 00:16:30.242
Joe!

00:16:30.275 --> 00:16:32.444
(frantic music)

00:16:32.478 --> 00:16:34.380
[Nohemon] This isn't
gonna end well.

00:16:34.413 --> 00:16:36.815
When the going gets tough,
the tough get going!

00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:39.585
You're joking.

00:16:39.618 --> 00:16:42.888
Don't tell me those losers
are here to try and ambush us.

00:16:42.921 --> 00:16:46.458
That Gaossmon, I should've
known he was behind this.

00:16:49.595 --> 00:16:52.231
[Gaossmon] This land will
be ours once and for all

00:16:52.264 --> 00:16:54.400
after we crush you to pieces!

00:16:54.433 --> 00:16:56.769
[MiniDekachimon] You're the
one who's gonna be crushed!

00:16:58.337 --> 00:16:59.672
What is this?

00:17:00.506 --> 00:17:02.641
How could they even
tell who's on whose side

00:17:02.675 --> 00:17:04.643
in all of this commotion?

00:17:04.677 --> 00:17:05.778
Got me.

00:17:05.811 --> 00:17:07.946
Oh man, they're both gonna
get crushed at this rate.

00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:09.481
Ready Joe?

00:17:09.515 --> 00:17:10.516
Oh, yeah.

00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:14.019
(heroic music)

00:17:27.633 --> 00:17:30.202
[Agumon] Agumon digivolve to,

00:17:43.849 --> 00:17:44.850
Greymon!

00:17:46.819 --> 00:17:49.555
[Gomamon] Gomamon digivolve to,

00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:52.191
Ikkakumon!

00:17:53.225 --> 00:17:54.193
What?

00:17:54.226 --> 00:17:55.794
He digivolved?

00:17:55.828 --> 00:17:56.829
Huh?

00:18:00.666 --> 00:18:02.701
Go, go, go! Get 'em, get 'em!

00:18:02.735 --> 00:18:03.736
Get 'em!

00:18:08.907 --> 00:18:11.310
(AtamaDekachimon roars)

00:18:11.343 --> 00:18:13.312
[Ikkakumon] Bring it on!

00:18:13.345 --> 00:18:14.379
Here we go!

00:18:24.189 --> 00:18:25.657
(Gaossmon roars)

00:18:25.691 --> 00:18:28.560
(Tai grunts)

00:18:28.594 --> 00:18:29.561
[Greymon] Tai!

00:18:29.595 --> 00:18:31.497
[Gaossmon] Now!

00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:34.566
(Greymon grunts)

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:35.601
Fire!

00:18:36.702 --> 00:18:38.003
(Greymon grunts)

00:18:38.036 --> 00:18:40.539
(Tai screams)

00:18:46.111 --> 00:18:47.913
Nice work, kid.

00:18:47.946 --> 00:18:49.414
Nohemon!

00:18:49.448 --> 00:18:52.618
When the going gets tough,
the tough get going, right?

00:19:04.563 --> 00:19:06.131
Leave that one to me.

00:19:07.299 --> 00:19:08.467
You sure about that?

00:19:09.301 --> 00:19:12.070
Please. Let me do it.

00:19:16.942 --> 00:19:18.877
[Tai] Greymon.

00:19:18.911 --> 00:19:20.479
[Greymon] Got it.

00:19:22.447 --> 00:19:25.150
(Nohemon grunts)

00:19:27.753 --> 00:19:30.055
(Gaossmon coughs)

00:19:30.088 --> 00:19:31.089
What?

00:19:35.928 --> 00:19:38.664
(Gaossmon gasps)

00:19:41.934 --> 00:19:44.803
(Tyrannomon roars)

00:19:57.115 --> 00:19:58.116
Fire now!

00:20:07.526 --> 00:20:09.328
(loud explosion)

00:20:09.361 --> 00:20:10.762
Nice shot!

00:20:10.796 --> 00:20:11.930
Oh, what?

00:20:11.964 --> 00:20:12.931
Why you little!

00:20:12.965 --> 00:20:15.868
(Gaossmon screams)

00:20:17.035 --> 00:20:20.472
[Greymon] We won't
fall for that again!

00:20:22.875 --> 00:20:25.844
(Gaossmon screams)

00:20:30.816 --> 00:20:32.284
[Ikkakumon] Huh?

00:20:32.317 --> 00:20:34.486
Not too shabby, Nohemon.

00:20:34.519 --> 00:20:37.189
I guess I helped out a
little back there, didn't I?

00:20:38.156 --> 00:20:40.692
(bright music)

00:20:45.564 --> 00:20:48.000
That's payback Tyranomon.

00:20:48.033 --> 00:20:51.203
Tell you what, if you quit being
your sleazy brothers puppet

00:20:51.236 --> 00:20:53.639
and promise to stop
troubling others

00:20:53.672 --> 00:20:55.574
I'll show you mercy
and let you live.

00:20:56.842 --> 00:20:57.910
Now get outta here.

00:21:00.579 --> 00:21:01.880
[Tai] Man, you're heavy.

00:21:06.051 --> 00:21:07.386
[Nohemon] Hey!

00:21:12.557 --> 00:21:14.893
Looks like Tyranomon
likes you now.

00:21:14.927 --> 00:21:17.262
Way to turn the
tables on 'em Nohemon.

00:21:23.769 --> 00:21:28.674
Oh, look there they are!

00:21:28.707 --> 00:21:31.877
[Kari] Big brother!

00:21:31.910 --> 00:21:33.879
[Sora] Where'd you
guys run off to?

00:21:33.912 --> 00:21:36.949
[Tai] Just a little
morning stroll.

[Izzy] Next up on the
Digimon encyclopedia is,

00:22:43.515 --> 00:22:45.083
Garbagemon.

00:22:45.117 --> 00:22:47.986
This Digimon mutated from a
trash can that empties data.

00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:50.622
Unchi Bazooka is
Garbagemon's specialty!

00:22:50.655 --> 00:22:52.791
Wait, Poop Bazooka?

00:22:52.824 --> 00:22:54.493
Anyway, check this out.

00:22:54.526 --> 00:22:57.262
His trash can sucks in
anything like a black hole.

00:22:57.295 --> 00:22:58.330
Isn't that neat?

00:22:58.363 --> 00:23:00.766
I asked him if I
could go inside of it,

00:23:00.799 --> 00:23:03.535
but Tentomon wasn't too
thrilled about that idea.

00:23:07.005 --> 00:23:09.374
Which Digimon will
it be next time?

00:23:10.675 --> 00:23:13.278
[Narrator] Tai and
Wargreymon fearlessly fight

00:23:13.311 --> 00:23:15.180
against Machinedramon.

00:23:15.213 --> 00:23:18.617
A shocking turn
of events ensues.

00:23:18.650 --> 00:23:21.019
[Tai] Next time, the
attack of Machinedramon.

00:23:21.053 --> 00:23:24.056
[Narrator] The adventure
continues in a new world.
