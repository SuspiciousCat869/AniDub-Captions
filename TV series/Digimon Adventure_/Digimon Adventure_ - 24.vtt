[Narrator] The fierce battle
against Devimon continued.

00:01:43.986 --> 00:01:45.387
During the conflict,

00:01:45.421 --> 00:01:47.423
Izzy discovered that
the energy produced

00:01:47.456 --> 00:01:49.224
from chaos within the network

00:01:49.258 --> 00:01:51.327
was being transferred
to Devimon.

00:01:53.662 --> 00:01:55.564
As soon as they discovered that,

00:01:55.597 --> 00:01:58.133
MegaKabuterimon's group
headed to the point

00:01:58.167 --> 00:02:00.135
where the energy
transfer was being made,

00:02:00.169 --> 00:02:02.638
and they succeeded
in intercepting it.

00:02:02.671 --> 00:02:05.074
Finally, the
Digidestined defeated

00:02:05.107 --> 00:02:07.643
the digivolved NeoDevimon.

00:02:07.676 --> 00:02:08.677
However...

00:02:11.513 --> 00:02:14.116
(shocked gasp)

00:02:15.184 --> 00:02:18.954

00:02:28.297 --> 00:02:31.967
(shocked, frightened gasps)

00:02:35.838 --> 00:02:36.805
Not good!

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:38.474
Quick! Get back!

00:02:38.507 --> 00:02:41.643
(worried, wary gasps)

00:02:42.711 --> 00:02:45.214
(loud rumble)

00:02:56.392 --> 00:02:58.727
(loud thud)

00:03:05.401 --> 00:03:06.802
That's a Mega Digimon.

00:03:06.835 --> 00:03:07.803
Huh?

00:03:07.836 --> 00:03:09.071
A Mega Digimon?

00:03:11.006 --> 00:03:12.708
[Tokomon] So is this
the digivolution

00:03:12.741 --> 00:03:14.810
Devimon was aiming for?

00:03:14.843 --> 00:03:19.681
But now, Devimon isn't
actually even Devimon anymore.

00:03:22.384 --> 00:03:23.852
What does that mean?

00:03:23.886 --> 00:03:27.322
Only Devimon's powers evolved.

00:03:27.356 --> 00:03:29.558
His mind was already...

00:03:29.591 --> 00:03:34.163
(eager growl/chuckle)

00:03:34.196 --> 00:03:37.099

(growls)

00:03:59.254 --> 00:04:01.256
Matt, what are you doing?

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.192
Don't worry about us, TK.

00:04:03.225 --> 00:04:05.561
If worse comes to
worst, just run!

00:04:09.231 --> 00:04:10.699
WereGarurumon!

00:04:10.732 --> 00:04:11.967

us, then it's all over!

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:16.131
What?

00:05:22.804 --> 00:05:25.874
Giga Storm!

00:05:33.382 --> 00:05:35.450
(shocked, worried gasp)

00:05:35.484 --> 00:05:37.019

(eager cackle)

00:05:59.508 --> 00:06:00.842
(dodging grunt)

00:06:00.876 --> 00:06:01.877
No, no way!

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:03.078
Matt, Tai, no!

00:06:07.082 --> 00:06:09.585
(loud rumble)

00:06:12.354 --> 00:06:13.722
Izzy, can you hear me?

00:06:13.755 --> 00:06:16.892
It's kind of a
disaster over here!

00:06:16.925 --> 00:06:19.027
[Garudamon] Wing Blade!

00:06:20.762 --> 00:06:23.565
There's still a ton of
them left to fight, too!

00:06:23.599 --> 00:06:24.766
Flower Cannon!

00:06:26.702 --> 00:06:29.204

00:06:29.237 --> 00:06:31.039
Are you okay, Lillymon?

00:06:31.073 --> 00:06:34.076
[Lillymon] I'm okay, we're
just struggling a little.

00:06:34.109 --> 00:06:35.677
[Garudamon] This is endless!

00:06:35.711 --> 00:06:39.414
Izzy, anything odd happening
on your side of things?

00:06:39.448 --> 00:06:41.383
Uh, just hold on a second.

00:06:43.452 --> 00:06:44.419
Uh, no!

00:06:44.453 --> 00:06:45.754
No way!

00:06:45.787 --> 00:06:47.356
Just a few minutes ago,

00:06:47.389 --> 00:06:50.058
two tankers collided in
the Strait of Hormuz!

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.195
And that's not all!

00:06:53.228 --> 00:06:55.397
Abnormally close encounters
between large vessels

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:58.133
are occurring in several
places all over the globe!

00:07:00.769 --> 00:07:02.337
(shocked gasp)

00:07:02.371 --> 00:07:04.272
There are accidents
occurring at the same time

00:07:04.306 --> 00:07:05.874
in oceans all around the world?

00:07:05.907 --> 00:07:07.109
That's not good.

00:07:07.142 --> 00:07:09.144
Oh, what on earth
is going on now?

00:07:11.747 --> 00:07:14.750
It means, that we still
aren't out of danger just yet!

00:07:18.654 --> 00:07:21.056
They've got us surrounded!

00:07:21.089 --> 00:07:23.291
Man, these guys are annoying.

00:07:23.325 --> 00:07:25.794
We need to work together
and focus our attacks!

00:07:25.827 --> 00:07:28.964
(affirmative grunt)

00:07:28.997 --> 00:07:31.333

This is bad.

00:15:08.523 --> 00:15:09.891
At this rate,

00:15:09.924 --> 00:15:13.728
MetalGreymon is gonna
become exactly like Devimon.

00:15:17.599 --> 00:15:18.867
(shocked waking grunt)

00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:21.035

00:15:27.208 --> 00:15:28.343
(coughs)

00:15:28.376 --> 00:15:29.911
Matt, are you okay?

00:15:29.944 --> 00:15:31.246
Oh!

00:15:31.279 --> 00:15:32.747
Matt, talk to me!

00:15:34.282 --> 00:15:35.884
TK, you're...

00:15:35.917 --> 00:15:37.051
Oh, Matt...

00:15:38.086 --> 00:15:39.370

(loud rumble)

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:43.535
Wait, is that?

00:16:44.536 --> 00:16:47.205
That's MetalGreymon, isn't it?

00:16:48.606 --> 00:16:52.277
(intense instrumental music)

00:16:56.214 --> 00:16:58.950
(eager laughter)

00:17:05.623 --> 00:17:09.060
(shocked, worried gasps)

00:17:10.295 --> 00:17:14.032
(gleeful laughter)

00:17:14.065 --> 00:17:17.902
(distraught, emotional grunt)

00:17:19.437 --> 00:17:22.273

(taken aback gasp)

00:17:28.313 --> 00:17:29.480
TK, help me!

00:17:30.582 --> 00:17:31.716
What?

00:17:31.749 --> 00:17:34.485
Together I know we can do this.

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:38.423
(stunned gasp)

00:17:38.456 --> 00:17:39.457
(determined agreeing grunt)

00:17:47.932 --> 00:17:49.567

00:17:49.601 --> 00:17:53.504
(melodious instrumental music)

00:18:28.873 --> 00:18:33.011
You mustn't allow anger
to consume your mind.

00:18:33.044 --> 00:18:35.146
(growls)

00:18:36.714 --> 00:18:39.984
Calm your heart and feel...

00:18:45.323 --> 00:18:48.026
(growls)

00:18:48.059 --> 00:18:52.830
Feel the presence of the one
that's irreplaceable to you.

00:19:02.573 --> 00:19:03.675
Who's that?

00:19:04.709 --> 00:19:06.077
Who's calling me?

00:19:11.349 --> 00:19:12.383
The one...

00:19:12.417 --> 00:19:14.419
The one calling me is...

00:19:19.857 --> 00:19:22.860
Tai!

00:19:30.868 --> 00:19:33.604

00:19:36.607 --> 00:19:40.278
(cringing from light grunt)

00:19:41.579 --> 00:19:43.414
No way, that light...

00:19:43.448 --> 00:19:45.083
(curious gasps)

00:19:45.116 --> 00:19:48.786
(cringing from light grunt)

00:19:52.056 --> 00:19:55.960

00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:26.717
Look this way!

00:21:27.552 --> 00:21:29.954

Garudamon has really long hair.

00:22:56.607 --> 00:22:59.277
I wonder if it ever gets
in the way during battle?

00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:00.711
Recently, Tentomon's been saying

00:23:00.745 --> 00:23:02.580
he wants to have long hair, too.

00:23:02.613 --> 00:23:03.648
