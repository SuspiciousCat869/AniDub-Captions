[Narrator] The Digi-Destined's
latest grand adventure

00:01:43.271 --> 00:01:45.207
has just begun!

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.508
The Great Catastrophe

00:01:46.541 --> 00:01:48.443
is rumored to occur
in the near future.

00:01:49.878 --> 00:01:52.214
It's said that the key to
avoiding this looming threat

00:01:52.247 --> 00:01:55.584
is to solve the mystery
of the eight crests.

00:01:55.617 --> 00:01:59.054
What's lying in wait for
our Digi-Destined heroes?

00:01:59.087 --> 00:02:01.056
One way to find out.

00:02:01.089 --> 00:02:03.792
(dramatic music)

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:08.697
(Tai sighing)

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:11.099
And take a look at all
that smoke down there.

00:02:11.132 --> 00:02:12.434
(Agumon sniffing)

00:02:12.467 --> 00:02:14.369
It kinda smells weird, huh?

00:02:14.402 --> 00:02:16.404
Now that you mention
it, you're right.

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.876
(all screaming)

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.379

(bouncing sound)

00:02:51.106 --> 00:02:52.741
That Digimon saved us.

00:02:52.774 --> 00:02:54.109
Looks like it.

00:02:54.142 --> 00:02:55.810
Jeez Louise!

00:02:55.844 --> 00:02:58.280
Haven't your heard
of safety first?

00:02:58.313 --> 00:02:59.848
You gotta be careful.

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.286
(Sora gasping)

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.755
All right, that's
enough dilly-dallying.

00:03:06.788 --> 00:03:08.456
Get back to your stations,

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.759
and remember to
put safety first.

00:03:10.792 --> 00:03:12.627
Safety first! (giggling)

00:03:16.364 --> 00:03:18.967
(gentle music)

00:03:21.636 --> 00:03:23.505
How's the data
recovery coming along?

00:03:23.538 --> 00:03:24.839
Any luck?

00:03:24.873 --> 00:03:27.008
Looks like it's gonna
take some more time,

00:03:27.042 --> 00:03:29.978
but, I'll let you know
if I find any clues

00:03:30.011 --> 00:03:31.680
about the Great Catastrophe.

00:03:31.713 --> 00:03:33.615
We're all counting
on you here, Izzy.

00:03:33.648 --> 00:03:34.783
[Izzy] I'll do my best.

00:03:34.816 --> 00:03:35.984
Good luck over there.

00:03:36.084 --> 00:03:37.185
Make way coming through

00:03:37.218 --> 00:03:39.287
-Oh, excuse us.
-Outta the way.

00:03:39.321 --> 00:03:41.990
Come on, you can't
just stand around.

00:03:42.023 --> 00:03:43.692
We're trying to
get work done here,

00:03:43.725 --> 00:03:46.795
and you are not
putting safety first.

00:03:46.828 --> 00:03:49.197
What do you mean safety first?

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.701
Safety first is Junkmon
industry's motto.

00:03:52.734 --> 00:03:54.469
I still don't get it.

00:03:54.502 --> 00:03:55.804
(Junkmon sighing)

00:03:55.837 --> 00:03:57.639
Hey, you's guys!

00:03:57.672 --> 00:03:59.708
When you all work, you put-

00:03:59.741 --> 00:04:03.712
Safety first! (giggling)

00:04:03.745 --> 00:04:05.647
Safety first. (giggling)

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:06.881
Safety First!

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:09.484
Did you say work?

00:04:09.517 --> 00:04:11.653
What are you all
working on, anyway?

00:04:11.686 --> 00:04:12.987
Are you blind?

00:04:13.021 --> 00:04:14.489
Didn't you guys see from above?

00:04:14.522 --> 00:04:15.657
(all gasping)

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.827
This island's volcano sometimes
has smaller eruptions here

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:20.028
and there.

00:04:20.061 --> 00:04:21.996
So, for everyone to
survive on this island,

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.899
we gotta build walls strong
enough to stop the lava

00:04:24.933 --> 00:04:28.169
and position them in a way
to change the flow of it.

00:04:28.203 --> 00:04:30.338
Wow, that sounds pretty tough.

00:04:30.372 --> 00:04:32.073
Why don't they just
leave the island?

00:04:32.107 --> 00:04:33.074
Mm.

00:04:33.108 --> 00:04:34.542
It's true that fighting nature

00:04:34.576 --> 00:04:36.678
can be troublesome at times,

00:04:36.711 --> 00:04:38.213
but no one has even considered

00:04:38.246 --> 00:04:40.582
the idea of leaving
the silent and moving.

00:04:40.615 --> 00:04:43.518
Why would they wanna leave
when they love it here?

00:04:43.551 --> 00:04:44.586
Right, everybody?

00:04:44.619 --> 00:04:46.354
[Mushroomon and Bakomon] Yeah!

00:04:46.388 --> 00:04:47.856
Love it!

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:51.092
But, lately, the volcano's
been acting up more and more.

00:04:51.126 --> 00:04:52.761
And if my instincts are right,

00:04:52.794 --> 00:04:55.263
then we're due for a
huge volcanic eruption

00:04:55.296 --> 00:04:56.865
just about any day now.

00:04:56.898 --> 00:04:57.899
[All] What?

00:04:57.932 --> 00:04:59.401
That's why we gotta hurry

00:04:59.434 --> 00:05:02.570
and strengthen the walls
before it decides to blow.

00:05:02.604 --> 00:05:04.572
That explains why
everyone's so busy.

00:05:06.107 --> 00:05:09.043
Hey, Tai, we should
try to help 'em out.

00:05:09.077 --> 00:05:10.578
Yeah!

00:05:10.612 --> 00:05:13.281
You know what they say,
the more, the merrier!

00:05:13.314 --> 00:05:14.449
Welcome aboard!

00:05:14.482 --> 00:05:17.118
All right, I'm gonna work hard.

00:05:17.152 --> 00:05:18.753
I am too!

00:05:18.787 --> 00:05:23.792
Remember, always put safety
first when you're working.

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:26.227
[All] Safety first! (giggling)

00:05:26.261 --> 00:05:27.228
[Junkmon] First,

00:05:27.262 --> 00:05:28.963
you need to gather
materials for the wall

00:05:28.997 --> 00:05:30.932
and transport them.

00:05:30.965 --> 00:05:34.903
[Tai] Oh, there's all
sorts of crazy stuff here.

00:05:34.936 --> 00:05:38.139
I wonder if all these things
somehow came from our world?

00:05:38.173 --> 00:05:39.240
Hmm.

00:05:39.274 --> 00:05:40.809
Check it out, Tai.

00:05:40.842 --> 00:05:42.143
Can you use this?

00:05:42.177 --> 00:05:43.978
Oh, that's a manhole cover.

00:05:44.012 --> 00:05:45.246
Yeah, I think so.

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:46.581
Oh, yeah!

00:05:46.614 --> 00:05:47.749
What about this?

00:05:47.782 --> 00:05:50.752
(Biyomon grunting)

00:05:50.785 --> 00:05:51.786
Biyomon, you okay?

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:52.821
Careful over there.

00:05:52.854 --> 00:05:54.756
No need to rush.

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:57.625
And, remember, when you
work here, you gotta put-

00:05:57.659 --> 00:06:01.429
[All] Safety first. (giggling)

00:06:01.463 --> 00:06:03.765
Next, you gotta transport
all the materials you got-

00:06:03.798 --> 00:06:06.000
[Mushroomon and
Bakomon] Safety first!

00:06:06.034 --> 00:06:08.803
[All] Safety first! (giggling)

00:06:10.038 --> 00:06:12.040
Then, you gotta mix the cement,

00:06:13.341 --> 00:06:15.510
and pour it onto the
loaded materials.

00:06:16.678 --> 00:06:18.813
Once that hardens up,
you're all finished.

00:06:18.847 --> 00:06:20.281
[All] Whoa!

00:06:20.315 --> 00:06:22.350
We also gotta increase
the wall's height

00:06:22.383 --> 00:06:24.686
and mend the breaks and
cracks when they appear.

00:06:24.719 --> 00:06:26.955
(Agumon and Tai giggling)

00:06:26.988 --> 00:06:29.123
There's tons of work
to be done here,

00:06:29.157 --> 00:06:31.526
so we're gonna work
you guys to the bone.

00:06:31.559 --> 00:06:34.529
Work fast, but more
importantly, work safe.

00:06:34.562 --> 00:06:35.530
Right, everyone?

00:06:35.563 --> 00:06:39.467
[All] Safety first! (giggling)

00:06:39.501 --> 00:06:40.502
Here it comes.

00:06:41.503 --> 00:06:42.670
Safety first!

00:06:42.704 --> 00:06:43.838
Nice catch!

00:06:43.872 --> 00:06:46.474
(Agumon giggling)

00:06:46.508 --> 00:06:47.675
(Biyomon grunting)

00:06:47.709 --> 00:06:48.710
All right!

00:06:49.677 --> 00:06:51.145
Ooh, not too shabby.

00:06:51.179 --> 00:06:52.146
Well done!

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:53.815
Hear that, Sora?

00:06:53.848 --> 00:06:55.717
I got a compliment.

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:56.818
Sure did!

00:06:56.851 --> 00:06:59.020
Now, let's keep going.

00:06:59.053 --> 00:07:01.189
I think I'm getting
the hang of this thing.

00:07:01.222 --> 00:07:04.826
Yeah, this is turning out
to be kind of fun, you know?

00:07:04.859 --> 00:07:07.896
Don't relax just because
you're getting used to it.

00:07:07.929 --> 00:07:09.497
You gotta be sure to put-

00:07:09.531 --> 00:07:12.000
[All] Safety first! (giggling)

00:07:12.033 --> 00:07:13.234
(booming sound)

00:07:13.268 --> 00:07:14.502
What is that?

00:07:14.536 --> 00:07:17.372
(Biyomon gasping)

00:07:20.542 --> 00:07:22.877
Sound the alarm!

00:07:22.911 --> 00:07:24.412
(alarm blaring)

00:07:24.445 --> 00:07:26.748
(volcano erupting)

00:07:26.781 --> 00:07:28.750
(crashing sounds)

00:07:28.783 --> 00:07:32.020
(Agumon groaning)

00:07:32.053 --> 00:07:33.521
Move, Sora!

00:07:33.555 --> 00:07:35.189
(metal clanging)

00:07:35.223 --> 00:07:36.391
Biyomon, no!

00:07:37.926 --> 00:07:39.861
(melancholic music)

00:07:39.894 --> 00:07:40.895
Biyomon!

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:45.366
(Tai grunting)

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:46.868
(Biyomon groaning)

00:07:46.901 --> 00:07:48.536
Hang in there, Biyomon.

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:51.239
(Sora grunting)

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:54.208
You's just leave it to me.

00:07:54.242 --> 00:07:56.945
(drilling sound)

00:07:58.413 --> 00:07:59.714
(metal clanging)

00:07:59.747 --> 00:08:00.748
Biyomon!

00:08:01.583 --> 00:08:02.884
(metal clanging)

00:08:02.917 --> 00:08:04.385
I got you.

00:08:04.419 --> 00:08:06.296
(melancholic music)

00:08:12.493 --> 00:08:14.729
There, that should do it.

00:08:14.762 --> 00:08:16.130
It's really nothing serious.

00:08:16.164 --> 00:08:17.298
I'm okay.

00:08:17.332 --> 00:08:20.134
Either way, it's still
gotta hurt, right?

00:08:20.168 --> 00:08:23.905
What matters most is
that you're okay, Sora.

00:08:23.938 --> 00:08:25.139
Thanks to you.

00:08:25.173 --> 00:08:27.308
But no more pushing yourself
like that, all right?

00:08:27.342 --> 00:08:28.509
Mm-hmm.

00:08:28.543 --> 00:08:30.778
I think I understand now why
you guys are in such a hurry

00:08:30.812 --> 00:08:31.980
to get these walls up.

00:08:32.013 --> 00:08:35.750
Yeah, before the
huge eruption comes,

00:08:35.783 --> 00:08:38.486
we gotta make 'em taller and
stronger, that's for sure.

00:08:38.519 --> 00:08:40.421
Then we have to
get back to work.

00:08:40.455 --> 00:08:42.757
I'm gonna work my hardest too.

00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:44.325
I'm with ya!
Let's get going!

00:08:44.359 --> 00:08:45.326
Me too!

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:46.494
Easy there.

00:08:46.527 --> 00:08:49.163
No more physical
labor for you's.

00:08:49.197 --> 00:08:51.666
He's right. You should
try to relax for now.

00:08:51.699 --> 00:08:52.934
But, I-

00:08:52.967 --> 00:08:54.502
You leave it to me.

00:08:54.535 --> 00:08:57.772
I'm gonna work hard enough
for the both of us, Biyomon.

00:08:57.805 --> 00:08:59.674
You just wait and see.

00:08:59.707 --> 00:09:01.776
Tai, Agumon, let's go.

00:09:01.809 --> 00:09:02.777
-Okay!
-Mm-hmm.

00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:03.811
All right, Junkmon.

00:09:03.845 --> 00:09:04.812
We're all set.

00:09:04.846 --> 00:09:06.314
What do you got for us?

00:09:06.347 --> 00:09:07.815
Ah, plenty.

00:09:07.849 --> 00:09:10.318
But you guys need to be
more careful when working.

00:09:10.351 --> 00:09:11.352
Make sure to put-

00:09:11.386 --> 00:09:13.688
Let me guess, safety first.

00:09:13.721 --> 00:09:15.523
I gotcha, I gotcha.

00:09:15.556 --> 00:09:17.358
Now, let's get to it.

00:09:17.392 --> 00:09:18.393
Yeah.

00:09:20.495 --> 00:09:21.462
Sora.

00:09:21.496 --> 00:09:22.830
(melancholic music)

00:09:22.864 --> 00:09:25.199
Make way, coming through!

00:09:25.233 --> 00:09:28.169
I am not slowing down,
so keep it coming!

00:09:28.202 --> 00:09:30.004
Leave all the
physical labor to me!

00:09:31.406 --> 00:09:32.674
Hey, I'll help you out.

00:09:36.077 --> 00:09:37.512
Steady, steady.

00:09:39.714 --> 00:09:42.650
Now, let's get to
building this wall taller!

00:09:42.684 --> 00:09:45.553
It has to be, if it's
gonna get the job done.

00:09:45.586 --> 00:09:47.689
Okay, on to the next one.

00:09:48.856 --> 00:09:51.025
(melancholic music)

00:09:51.059 --> 00:09:52.060
Sora.

00:09:52.093 --> 00:09:53.327
Yeah, just like that.

00:09:53.361 --> 00:09:54.328
You got it.

00:09:54.362 --> 00:09:57.031
(Sora grunting)

00:09:58.866 --> 00:10:01.169
Hey, Sora.

00:10:01.202 --> 00:10:02.270
Biyomon?

00:10:02.303 --> 00:10:04.739
You shouldn't be here right
now, you need to rest.

00:10:04.772 --> 00:10:07.709
But I can't just sit
by while you work.

00:10:07.742 --> 00:10:08.876
Let's work together.

00:10:10.278 --> 00:10:13.281
Sure, how about you carry
the materials together?

00:10:14.382 --> 00:10:15.850
Yeah, that's perfect!

00:10:15.883 --> 00:10:16.884
Let's go, Sora.

00:10:18.219 --> 00:10:21.556
(Sora grunting)

00:10:21.589 --> 00:10:26.527
Sora, Junkmon told us we should
carry it together, right?

00:10:26.561 --> 00:10:28.096
So, let's do it together.

00:10:28.129 --> 00:10:29.230
No, Biyomon.

00:10:29.263 --> 00:10:30.765
You're nowhere near
being healed yet.

00:10:30.798 --> 00:10:32.934
But I'm fine already.

00:10:32.967 --> 00:10:33.935
Look, look, it's better.

00:10:33.968 --> 00:10:35.703
-See?
-I said no.

00:10:35.737 --> 00:10:37.538
What if you end up
pushing yourself

00:10:37.572 --> 00:10:38.940
and get hurt even worse?

00:10:39.607 --> 00:10:40.942
But you've been pushing yourself

00:10:40.975 --> 00:10:43.544
doing all of this
hard work on your own.

00:10:43.578 --> 00:10:46.214
How come it's okay for
you, but not for me, Sora?

00:10:46.247 --> 00:10:47.215
(Sora sighing)

00:10:47.248 --> 00:10:49.250
(Biyomon crying)

00:10:49.283 --> 00:10:51.385
(Sora sighing)

00:10:51.419 --> 00:10:54.288
I'm only doing this for
your own good, Biyomon.

00:10:54.322 --> 00:10:57.458
What don't you
understand about that?

00:10:57.492 --> 00:11:00.595
But I'm worried about you
getting hurt out there too.

00:11:00.628 --> 00:11:02.096
Come on, please, Sora.

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:05.733
I can manage doing this work
by myself just fine, okay?

00:11:05.767 --> 00:11:06.801
(metal clanging)

00:11:06.834 --> 00:11:08.736
(Sora and Biyomon gasping)

00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:11.739
(Biyomon sighing)

00:11:11.773 --> 00:11:15.143
Biyomon, this island
is super dangerous.

00:11:15.176 --> 00:11:16.177
That's why-

00:11:17.512 --> 00:11:20.915
Why can't you just trust me
when I say I can handle it?

00:11:20.948 --> 00:11:23.484
(Sora gasping)

00:11:25.853 --> 00:11:27.255
I hate you, Sora!

00:11:27.288 --> 00:11:28.656
(Sora gasping)

00:11:28.689 --> 00:11:31.459
(Biyomon crying)

00:11:33.628 --> 00:11:34.629
Biyomon.

00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:39.300
(bright music)

00:11:39.333 --> 00:11:42.837
(waves crashing)

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:44.505
Sora.

00:11:44.539 --> 00:11:46.507
I hate you, Sora!

00:11:46.541 --> 00:11:48.142
(Sora gasping)

00:11:48.176 --> 00:11:50.611
(melancholic music)

00:11:50.645 --> 00:11:51.946
Sora.

00:11:51.979 --> 00:11:55.016
(melancholic music)

00:11:55.049 --> 00:11:59.687
Why can't you just trust me
when I say I can handle it?

00:12:03.524 --> 00:12:04.792
Why aren't you working?

00:12:04.826 --> 00:12:06.294
(Sora gasping)

00:12:06.327 --> 00:12:08.663
If you can't focus,
take a break.

00:12:08.696 --> 00:12:10.665
You gotta put
safety first, right?

00:12:11.833 --> 00:12:14.569
I can't imagine fighting
over something so petty.

00:12:15.736 --> 00:12:18.139
You do the dangerous
tasks by yourself too,

00:12:18.172 --> 00:12:19.841
don't you, Junkmon?

00:12:19.874 --> 00:12:22.376
And you only do it because
you care about everyone

00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:24.545
and wanna protect them, right?

00:12:24.579 --> 00:12:26.347
You couldn't be more wrong.

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:27.548
Huh?

00:12:27.582 --> 00:12:29.851
I'm actually the one
being protected by them.

00:12:30.852 --> 00:12:32.086
Those little ones and I.

00:12:33.521 --> 00:12:37.058
This I can't run if we
don't do our jobs properly.

00:12:37.091 --> 00:12:39.527
In other words, this
wall that we're building

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:41.829
is built from the trust
between me and the little ones.

00:12:41.863 --> 00:12:45.700
It's teamwork through and
through, I tell you. (chuckling)

00:12:45.733 --> 00:12:47.568
Built from trust.

00:12:47.602 --> 00:12:50.605
(melancholic music)

00:12:53.608 --> 00:12:55.710
We were always together,

00:12:57.778 --> 00:12:58.779
but now,

00:13:01.782 --> 00:13:04.285
she says she's fine
all by herself.

00:13:07.388 --> 00:13:08.389
Sora.

00:13:10.057 --> 00:13:12.426
I have to apologize to Biyomon.

00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:13.895
It's my fault.

00:13:13.928 --> 00:13:14.929
(volcano erupting)

00:13:14.962 --> 00:13:17.565
(Sora gasping)

00:13:23.771 --> 00:13:25.539
(Junkmon gasping)

00:13:25.573 --> 00:13:27.375
Sound the alarm!

00:13:27.408 --> 00:13:29.710
Evacuate immediately!

00:13:29.744 --> 00:13:32.413
(alarm blaring)

00:13:34.916 --> 00:13:37.385
(volcano rumbling)

00:13:37.418 --> 00:13:39.420
(volcano erupting)

00:13:39.453 --> 00:13:40.421
(Agumon gasping)

00:13:40.454 --> 00:13:41.756
It's erupting!

00:13:44.292 --> 00:13:46.961
I had a feeling the big
one was coming soon.

00:13:46.994 --> 00:13:47.995
Evacuate!

00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:50.131
Huh?

00:13:50.164 --> 00:13:51.565
Hey, what are you doing?

00:13:51.599 --> 00:13:52.700
Run!

00:13:52.733 --> 00:13:55.069
But we have to protect them
with the wall don't we?

00:13:55.102 --> 00:13:58.639
The wall is only there
to buy time to evacuate.

00:13:58.673 --> 00:14:00.241
When you're dealing with nature,

00:14:00.274 --> 00:14:02.243
you have to put your
life's safety first.

00:14:02.276 --> 00:14:03.277
Let's go!

00:14:04.779 --> 00:14:07.281
(tense music)

00:14:15.323 --> 00:14:17.858
(lava hissing)

00:14:20.628 --> 00:14:23.130
(tense music)

00:14:26.634 --> 00:14:29.603
Come on, we have to save the
Digimon who couldn't escape.

00:14:29.637 --> 00:14:32.006
(Agumon grunting)

00:14:32.039 --> 00:14:33.874
Agumon digivolve to...

00:14:40.348 --> 00:14:41.349
Greymon!

00:14:44.986 --> 00:14:46.721
Greymon digivolve to...

00:14:55.496 --> 00:14:56.731
MetalGreymon!

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.368
Let's go!

00:15:00.401 --> 00:15:01.836
Going!

00:15:01.869 --> 00:15:05.039
(suspenseful music)

00:15:05.072 --> 00:15:08.376
I have to help out too!

00:15:08.409 --> 00:15:11.145
I'm coming, Sora.

00:15:11.178 --> 00:15:14.048
(Digimon screaming)

00:15:14.081 --> 00:15:16.217
(rumbling sound)

00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:17.985
[MetalGreymon]
We're here to help.

00:15:18.019 --> 00:15:20.187
[Tai] Quick, hop on!

00:15:20.221 --> 00:15:23.057
(lava squelching)

00:15:24.525 --> 00:15:26.727
(Sora screaming)

00:15:26.761 --> 00:15:29.163
(Sora grunting)

00:15:29.196 --> 00:15:30.197
Junkmon!

00:15:30.931 --> 00:15:33.067
(footsteps pattering)

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:34.068
(Junkmon groaning)

00:15:34.101 --> 00:15:35.269
Hang in there.

00:15:37.038 --> 00:15:39.573
Biyomon, can you hear me?

00:15:39.607 --> 00:15:42.910
(rock blasting)

00:15:42.943 --> 00:15:45.613
(Sora grunting)

00:15:46.947 --> 00:15:49.383
(footsteps pattering)

00:15:56.348 --> 00:15:59.518
(lava squelching)

00:15:59.552 --> 00:16:01.353
(Sora grunting)

00:16:01.387 --> 00:16:04.056
(air whooshing)

00:16:08.527 --> 00:16:09.528
Sora.

00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:12.264
Sora, I'm here.

00:16:13.099 --> 00:16:14.066
(Sora gasping)

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:15.101
Sora?

00:16:16.735 --> 00:16:17.903
There you are.

00:16:17.937 --> 00:16:18.904
Biyomon.

00:16:18.938 --> 00:16:20.406
(Biyomon crying)

00:16:20.439 --> 00:16:23.676
[Biyomon] I'm sorry I told
you I hated you, Sora.

00:16:23.709 --> 00:16:27.046
I was lonely and felt like
I was being left behind.

00:16:30.049 --> 00:16:32.184
[Sora] I'm sorry I
told you I was fine

00:16:32.218 --> 00:16:34.253
all by myself earlier.

00:16:34.286 --> 00:16:35.421
[Biyomon] It's okay.

00:16:36.288 --> 00:16:37.289
Sora.

00:16:39.058 --> 00:16:42.194
We gotta take Junkmon
and get out of this area.

00:16:42.228 --> 00:16:44.597
I need your help, Biyomon.

00:16:44.630 --> 00:16:46.098
You got that right.

00:16:46.132 --> 00:16:47.133
Let's go!

00:16:50.469 --> 00:16:52.404
Biyomon digivolve to...

00:16:57.910 --> 00:16:58.911
Birdramon!

00:17:02.148 --> 00:17:04.583
[Tai] Sora, you're okay!

00:17:04.617 --> 00:17:06.452
[Sora] Take care of Junkmon.

00:17:06.485 --> 00:17:07.486
[MetalGreymon] Sure.

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:10.222
[Tai] What are you gonna do?

00:17:10.256 --> 00:17:12.925
The lava might start
making its way down here.

00:17:12.958 --> 00:17:14.760
(volcano rumbling)

00:17:14.793 --> 00:17:16.295
(rocks blasting)

00:17:16.328 --> 00:17:17.897
(Digimon crying)

00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:19.965
We'll stop it before it does.

00:17:19.999 --> 00:17:21.267
[Junkmon] It's no use!

00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:22.301
No.

00:17:23.302 --> 00:17:25.738
If anyone can make
it happen, it's us.

00:17:25.771 --> 00:17:28.174
Evacuate everyone to
the ocean right now.

00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:34.446
All right, let's go, Birdramon.

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:36.682
Birdramon digivolve to...

00:17:37.616 --> 00:17:40.352
(dramatic music)

00:17:44.857 --> 00:17:46.659
Garudamon!

00:17:46.692 --> 00:17:49.762
(dramatic music)

00:17:49.795 --> 00:17:52.498
(Garudamon grunting)

00:17:52.531 --> 00:17:55.301
(dramatic music)

00:18:05.177 --> 00:18:08.981
(Garudamon grunting)

00:18:09.014 --> 00:18:11.817
(dramatic music)

00:18:17.556 --> 00:18:18.824
It's no good!

00:18:21.694 --> 00:18:24.964
(lava squelching)

00:18:24.997 --> 00:18:26.799
(Digimon groaning)

00:18:26.832 --> 00:18:29.568
(dramatic music)

00:18:35.407 --> 00:18:37.076
[Garudamon] Sora, are you okay?

00:18:38.344 --> 00:18:40.079
[Sora] Couldn't be
better, Garudamon.

00:18:42.181 --> 00:18:44.216
[Garudamon] If the two
of us are together,

00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:47.086
we can overcome any
obstacle in our way.

00:18:48.721 --> 00:18:50.823
You know, I couldn't agree more.

00:18:50.856 --> 00:18:53.325
[Garudamon] My dear Sora.

00:18:53.359 --> 00:18:54.727
-I trust you!
-I trust you!

00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:57.363
(upbeat music)

00:19:00.866 --> 00:19:03.068
Garudamon digivolve to...

00:19:07.439 --> 00:19:12.444
(singing in Japanese)

00:19:18.617 --> 00:19:19.718
Phoenixmon!

00:19:22.454 --> 00:19:24.390
(Tai gasping)

00:19:24.423 --> 00:19:29.261
(singing in Japanese)

00:19:30.629 --> 00:19:33.198
Sora, your love
has given me power

00:19:33.232 --> 00:19:35.701
beyond my wildest dreams!

00:19:35.734 --> 00:19:38.871
(singing in Japanese)

00:19:38.904 --> 00:19:40.873
Then let's fly, Phoenixmon!

00:19:40.906 --> 00:19:42.541
Higher than ever before!

00:19:42.574 --> 00:19:44.076
You've got it!

00:19:44.109 --> 00:19:48.947
(singing in Japanese)

00:19:59.491 --> 00:20:00.592
So awesome.

00:20:04.496 --> 00:20:07.900
Whoa, I've never seen
anything like this.

00:20:07.933 --> 00:20:12.771
(singing in Japanese)

00:20:36.195 --> 00:20:37.996
[MetalGreymon] Tai.

00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:40.499
Yeah, it's beautiful.

00:20:41.667 --> 00:20:45.337
[Phoenixmon] Sora, thank
you for trusting me.

00:20:45.371 --> 00:20:46.372
Mm-hmm.

00:20:48.507 --> 00:20:50.275
(gentle music)

00:20:50.309 --> 00:20:51.310
Sora!

00:20:53.212 --> 00:20:55.314
I love you so much, Sora!

00:20:56.882 --> 00:20:58.283
I love you too.

00:20:58.317 --> 00:21:02.020
(Sora and Biyomon giggling)

00:21:02.054 --> 00:21:04.123
No change at all, huh?

00:21:04.156 --> 00:21:07.693
So does this mean we should
just keep moving forward then?

00:21:07.726 --> 00:21:09.962
Let's see what ours is saying.

00:21:09.995 --> 00:21:12.464
(Digivice beeping)

00:21:12.498 --> 00:21:15.300
We can't tell which way
to go either, can we?

00:21:15.334 --> 00:21:16.702
Nope.

00:21:16.735 --> 00:21:20.038
Then how's about you all
visit the hot springs with me?

00:21:20.072 --> 00:21:21.306
Hot springs?

00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:23.142
Since the eruption
finally settled,

00:21:23.175 --> 00:21:25.077
I was thinking of
recuperating there.

00:21:26.412 --> 00:21:28.647
Hey, Tai, are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:29.648
Oh, yeah!

00:21:29.681 --> 00:21:31.216
Kari and the others
might be there.

00:21:31.250 --> 00:21:32.985
Hot springs it is, I guess.

00:21:33.018 --> 00:21:34.753
Oh, boy, I can't wait!

[Izzy] Next up on the Digimon
Encyclopedia is Phoenixmon!

00:22:43.989 --> 00:22:48.093
Garudamon digivolves into
this golden bird Digimon.

00:22:48.126 --> 00:22:50.262
Its special move,
Starlight Explosion,

00:22:50.295 --> 00:22:52.731
purges all types of evil!

00:22:52.764 --> 00:22:54.900
[Biyomon] Now let's
check me out, shall we?

00:22:54.933 --> 00:22:55.901
[Izzy] Biyomon?

00:22:55.934 --> 00:22:57.102
[Biyomon] With four wings now,

00:22:57.135 --> 00:22:58.904
I feel like I could
fly anywhere.

00:22:58.937 --> 00:23:00.739
But I haven't adjusted back yet,

00:23:00.772 --> 00:23:03.141
so it feels a little
odd flying with two.

00:23:03.175 --> 00:23:04.810
Oh, no, I'm gonna fall!

00:23:04.843 --> 00:23:06.478
(bright music)

00:23:06.512 --> 00:23:09.114
[Izzy] Which Digimon
will it be next time?

00:23:10.482 --> 00:23:14.286
[Narrator] The hot springs'
ruler, ShogunGekomon.

00:23:14.319 --> 00:23:16.989
Will Joe be able to save
the captured Gomamon

00:23:17.022 --> 00:23:18.757
and free the hot springs?

00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:21.660
[Tai] Next time, "The
Geko Hot Springs' Revolt."

00:23:21.693 --> 00:23:24.363
[Narrator] The adventure
continues in a new world.
