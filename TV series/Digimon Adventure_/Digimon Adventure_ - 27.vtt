[Narrator] This is
the mysterious world

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.637
where Digimon live,
The Digital World.

00:01:45.637 --> 00:01:48.139
Tai, Kari, and the
other Digi-destined

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:51.810
alongside their Digimon
partners head to a new stage

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.895
in their grand adventure.

00:01:58.984 --> 00:02:00.193
(Digimon roars)

00:02:00.235 --> 00:02:02.362
While Tai's party
was adrift at sea,

00:02:02.404 --> 00:02:04.656
they witnessed a
Digimon digivolve

00:02:04.656 --> 00:02:07.826
after eating another Digimon.

00:02:07.826 --> 00:02:10.662
Surrounded by fearsome
sea predators,

00:02:10.662 --> 00:02:13.039
the party is saved by
their friends who were able

00:02:13.081 --> 00:02:16.876
to make it back in the nick
of time from the real world.

00:02:16.918 --> 00:02:19.379
And the one who brought
them back was...

00:02:19.421 --> 00:02:22.549
Kari? No way. How
did you get here?

00:02:30.557 --> 00:02:33.351
(waves splashing)

00:02:35.437 --> 00:02:38.356
(thunder rumbling)

00:02:40.066 --> 00:02:44.571
Try to think. Who called
you here? Who was it?

00:02:44.612 --> 00:02:46.197
I can't remember.

00:02:47.407 --> 00:02:49.909
It was wild! There was
a huge, bright flash!

00:02:49.951 --> 00:02:51.703
After that happened
we all ended up

00:02:51.745 --> 00:02:54.080
back here in the Digital World.

00:02:54.122 --> 00:02:58.543
-It was one big flash.
-(thunder rumbling)

00:02:58.543 --> 00:03:00.712
[Tai] Is that another continent?

00:03:00.754 --> 00:03:03.548
But what is that
black lightning?

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:06.760
Huh?

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:12.098
(beeping from Digivices)

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:13.558
Huh?

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.393
[Izzy] Sorry to
startle you guys.

00:03:15.393 --> 00:03:16.394
Huh?

00:03:16.394 --> 00:03:17.604
I just installed an update

00:03:17.645 --> 00:03:20.106
on all of your
Digivices. Check it out!

00:03:20.148 --> 00:03:22.067
We had ours updated earlier.

00:03:22.108 --> 00:03:24.069
I went ahead and added
the communication feature

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:26.905
between your
partners, and this...

00:03:26.905 --> 00:03:27.906
(gasps)

00:03:27.906 --> 00:03:29.616
[Izzy] The database
I extracted from

00:03:29.657 --> 00:03:31.910
the Cloud Continent's fortress.

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.079
I put that into the
Digivice as a test,

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:37.582
and it seemed to work
well across the board.

00:03:37.582 --> 00:03:39.793
It'll read a Digimon's
vital signs now,

00:03:39.834 --> 00:03:42.420
enabling it to fully analyze
and display as much data

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.758
on them as possible. It should
be a big help from now on.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.259
Whoa!

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:50.804
Also, we have some
important information

00:03:50.845 --> 00:03:52.972
that we really need to
share with you guys.

00:03:53.014 --> 00:03:56.643
This is a nasty in-training
Digimon. It's called Zurumon.

00:03:56.684 --> 00:03:59.813
They've been consuming our
world's network data as energy

00:03:59.854 --> 00:04:02.107
and causing a lot of chaos.

00:04:02.107 --> 00:04:04.317
It seems like they're still
active in various places

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:07.153
even now, causing power failures

00:04:07.195 --> 00:04:10.698
and information leakages
across the world.

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:13.618
[Matt] You mean to tell
me even with Devimon

00:04:13.618 --> 00:04:17.497
out of the picture our world
is still facing new disasters?

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:19.624
You're right, it's
super weird. I wonder if

00:04:19.624 --> 00:04:23.128
it's somehow related to that
crazy outbreak of Zurumon.

00:04:23.128 --> 00:04:25.296
(thunder rumbles)

00:04:25.296 --> 00:04:26.840
-Are you okay?
-Huh?

00:04:26.881 --> 00:04:30.677
Don't be scared, Kari.
My name is Agumon.

00:04:31.886 --> 00:04:36.641
Agumon? (giggles) My
name is Kari Kamiya.

00:04:36.683 --> 00:04:38.977
You're really cute, Agumon!

00:04:39.018 --> 00:04:40.478
Nice to meet you!

00:04:40.478 --> 00:04:44.149
You're not surprised or freaked
out by all these Digimon?

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.525
Hm?

00:04:45.567 --> 00:04:48.361
(wings flapping)

00:04:54.826 --> 00:04:59.038
This is my friend Patamon,
and my name is TK.

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.751
I'm Kari, nice to meet you.
Patamon is super cute too.

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:06.212
Is TK the brother you mentioned

00:05:06.254 --> 00:05:08.047
to us earlier by any chance?

00:05:08.089 --> 00:05:10.550
Sure is. It seems he
was called here as

00:05:10.592 --> 00:05:13.511
the Celestial Digimon's partner.

00:05:13.511 --> 00:05:16.222
[Sora] Wait, hold on a second.

00:05:16.264 --> 00:05:19.017
So does that mean you're
the Celestial Digimon?

00:05:19.017 --> 00:05:20.018
Mhm.

00:05:20.018 --> 00:05:22.353
Whoa, didn't see that coming.

00:05:22.395 --> 00:05:25.023
I guess I was expecting
you to look a lot different

00:05:25.064 --> 00:05:27.400
but you're just like us!

00:05:27.442 --> 00:05:29.736
Pleasure to meet
you, I'm Joe Kido,

00:05:29.777 --> 00:05:34.032
and I am your fearless leader.
If you need anything at all

00:05:34.073 --> 00:05:37.076
you just ask me! After all
I am the oldest one here

00:05:37.118 --> 00:05:39.245
which naturally makes
me in charge of things

00:05:39.287 --> 00:05:40.872
when it comes to decisions!

00:05:40.872 --> 00:05:42.373
Hey Kari, listen,

00:05:42.415 --> 00:05:44.375
do you have anything
that looks like this?

00:05:44.375 --> 00:05:45.543
Hmm, uh-uh.

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:50.006
[Tai] Interesting.

00:05:50.048 --> 00:05:52.508
Woo! Now that the introductions
are out of the way,

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:54.886
I'm gonna fly ahead and
try to scout a little.

00:05:54.928 --> 00:05:56.054
I'm going too!

00:05:56.095 --> 00:05:57.055
[Izzy] Wait!

00:05:57.096 --> 00:05:59.474
Huh? Did I forget something?

00:06:02.393 --> 00:06:06.606
Look at this. There's
a problem at NASA!

00:06:06.648 --> 00:06:07.649
At NASA?

00:06:08.816 --> 00:06:10.235
[Izzy] A system
error just occurred

00:06:10.276 --> 00:06:12.904
during a scheduled
rocket launch.

00:06:12.904 --> 00:06:15.615
The network's in chaos,
causing a malfunction,

00:06:15.657 --> 00:06:19.953
and the pressure of the
engine is suddenly rising!

00:06:19.994 --> 00:06:22.497
It's spiraling out of control!

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:27.418
(eerie music begins)

00:06:32.465 --> 00:06:34.300
(explosion sound)

00:06:34.342 --> 00:06:35.760
It just exploded!

00:06:36.636 --> 00:06:38.137
[Izzy] They're
live-streaming the launch,

00:06:38.179 --> 00:06:41.099
so a lot of information
is going around online.

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:43.434
And now the U.S.
and other nations

00:06:43.434 --> 00:06:46.771
are scrambling around
to gather data!

00:06:46.813 --> 00:06:49.148
(screaming)

00:06:50.275 --> 00:06:54.279
(intense music
and winds gusting)

00:06:56.614 --> 00:06:58.449
(kids whimper)

00:06:58.449 --> 00:07:00.785
(Kari yells out)

00:07:00.785 --> 00:07:01.828
You okay, Kari?

00:07:01.869 --> 00:07:04.622
That was a close
one, thanks Tai.

00:07:04.664 --> 00:07:07.292
[Sora] This black
lightning's intensity...

00:07:07.292 --> 00:07:09.335
It's as if the
lightning is somehow

00:07:09.377 --> 00:07:12.630
synchronized to our
world's disasters.

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:13.798
Mimi!

00:07:13.798 --> 00:07:14.882
Oh, Palmon!

00:07:16.467 --> 00:07:19.012
It looks like the
black energy's growing.

00:07:19.053 --> 00:07:23.141
The responses online are
becoming intense too!

00:07:23.141 --> 00:07:27.145
If the Zurumon are
behind all of this...

00:07:27.145 --> 00:07:29.689
Then it's like what
happened earlier,

00:07:29.731 --> 00:07:32.150
with Nidhoggmon and Devimon.

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:33.693
And someone's trying
to produce energy

00:07:33.735 --> 00:07:35.486
from our world's chaos,

00:07:35.486 --> 00:07:38.656
and use it to cause havoc
in the Digital World!

00:07:38.656 --> 00:07:40.491
[Izzy] Which means
something bad is probably

00:07:40.491 --> 00:07:43.870
about to happen in
the Digital World.

00:07:47.373 --> 00:07:49.876
The Zurumon's activity
is just an omen.

00:07:49.876 --> 00:07:52.003
In order to solve this...

00:07:53.171 --> 00:07:55.965
We've gotta step up and
do something about it.

00:07:56.007 --> 00:07:57.633
Yeah.

00:07:57.675 --> 00:08:01.387
(lightning striking)

00:08:01.387 --> 00:08:06.392
(cries out) Do something about
this scary lightning first!

00:08:06.559 --> 00:08:07.518
I'm gonna puke!

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:08.686
Joe!

00:08:08.728 --> 00:08:11.022
The lightning is
getting more intense.

00:08:11.064 --> 00:08:14.192
Yeah, and it looks like it's
trying to target ElDradimon!

00:08:14.233 --> 00:08:15.860
(lightning zaps)

00:08:15.902 --> 00:08:17.070
Uh!

00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:20.073
(intense music starts)

00:08:20.073 --> 00:08:21.324
Leomon!

00:08:21.366 --> 00:08:24.160
(Leomon groans)

00:08:24.202 --> 00:08:25.703
Please be careful!

00:08:26.913 --> 00:08:29.749
This is no ordinary
storm, child.

00:08:29.749 --> 00:08:32.168
All of you need to
get out of here now.

00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:35.004
If we stay here, we're
bound to fall into the sea.

00:08:35.046 --> 00:08:36.756
What about you guys?

00:08:36.756 --> 00:08:40.426
ElDradimon's wounds from the
miasma aren't healed yet.

00:08:40.426 --> 00:08:42.595
We can't leave him behind.

00:08:45.598 --> 00:08:47.934
So you guys head
for that continent.

00:08:47.934 --> 00:08:51.020
I'm sure it's no
coincidence you came here.

00:08:51.062 --> 00:08:55.691
To uncover your true purpose,
you must keep moving forward.

00:08:55.733 --> 00:08:56.734
Leomon...

00:08:57.777 --> 00:08:58.778
Hm.

00:09:00.905 --> 00:09:02.407
-Hm.
-Hm.

00:09:02.448 --> 00:09:03.449
Hm.

00:09:04.742 --> 00:09:08.621
(lightning and powerful winds)

00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:13.292
Okay! Let's do this.

00:09:13.292 --> 00:09:14.877
Can you help us, Biyomon?

00:09:14.919 --> 00:09:15.962
Leave it to me.

00:09:16.796 --> 00:09:18.297
Ready to boogie?

00:09:18.297 --> 00:09:19.924
Ready when you are.

00:09:20.758 --> 00:09:23.261
Biyomon digivolve to

00:09:23.302 --> 00:09:24.303
Birdramon!

00:09:25.138 --> 00:09:27.890
Tentomon digivolve to

00:09:27.932 --> 00:09:28.933
Kabuterimon!

00:09:30.268 --> 00:09:32.437
I hope you're ready, Joe!

00:09:32.478 --> 00:09:35.106
Gomamon, wait a secon- ahh!

00:09:35.148 --> 00:09:38.651
Gomamon digivolve to Ikkakumon!

00:09:38.651 --> 00:09:39.819
Quick, hop on!

00:09:41.112 --> 00:09:42.447
(Joe whimpers)

00:09:42.488 --> 00:09:44.323
Hold on tight you guys!

00:09:44.323 --> 00:09:47.577
(adventurous music plays)

00:09:47.618 --> 00:09:50.246
(Leomon yells)

00:09:50.288 --> 00:09:52.957
Farewell children!
Until we meet again,

00:09:52.999 --> 00:09:55.751
we leave the fate
of our world to you.

00:09:55.793 --> 00:09:58.796
(lightning strikes)

00:09:59.672 --> 00:10:03.009
(children gasping)

00:10:03.009 --> 00:10:07.597
(music intensifies and ends)

00:10:07.638 --> 00:10:12.643
(electricity crackles
and wind gushes)

00:10:13.144 --> 00:10:14.854
(boom)

00:10:25.031 --> 00:10:26.032
Leomon.

00:10:27.033 --> 00:10:28.451
[Kabuterimon] Don't look back.

00:10:28.493 --> 00:10:29.702
Huh?

00:10:29.702 --> 00:10:33.372
All we can do is move
forward from here. Hm?

00:10:36.334 --> 00:10:37.877
What is that?

00:10:37.877 --> 00:10:41.339
If we go any higher I'm
gonna cry, I mean it!

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:42.882
Try not to look down, Mimi!

00:10:42.882 --> 00:10:47.345
Keep your eyes on the
horizon. We're almost to land!

00:10:49.222 --> 00:10:50.848
[Ikkakumon] Ah, heads up!

00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:52.225
What?

00:10:52.225 --> 00:10:54.185
Hey Tai, looks like there's

00:10:54.227 --> 00:10:57.063
some sort of movement on shore.

00:10:57.063 --> 00:10:59.023
Yeah, I think I just saw it too.

00:10:59.065 --> 00:11:01.067
Look out Tai!

00:11:01.067 --> 00:11:03.569
(missiles launching)

00:11:03.569 --> 00:11:04.904
[Kabuterimon] What's happening?

00:11:04.904 --> 00:11:06.572
[Agumon] It's an ambush!

00:11:07.406 --> 00:11:08.407
Watch Kari for me.

00:11:08.407 --> 00:11:09.825
Uh, you got it.

00:11:09.867 --> 00:11:11.410
-Let's go get 'em!
-Right!

00:11:11.869 --> 00:11:13.371
Be careful, Tai.

00:11:14.247 --> 00:11:16.040
Agumon digivolve to

00:11:16.916 --> 00:11:17.917
Greymon!

00:11:20.711 --> 00:11:22.505
Here they come!

00:11:22.547 --> 00:11:25.591
(explosion and roars)

00:11:25.591 --> 00:11:28.719
(rocks rumbling)

00:11:28.761 --> 00:11:29.929
He's so cool.

00:11:32.223 --> 00:11:34.684
(chittering)

00:11:34.725 --> 00:11:37.270
[Tai] How many of
them are there?

00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:40.606
These guys are gonna
try to eat us too!

00:11:41.274 --> 00:11:42.650
[Izzy] Those are Tortomon!

00:11:42.692 --> 00:11:45.278
Seems like they're at
the Champion level.

00:11:46.112 --> 00:11:47.572
(rockets launch)

00:11:51.742 --> 00:11:54.745
Now's your chance to land
while they're distracted!

00:11:54.787 --> 00:11:56.080
Not letting up.

00:11:56.122 --> 00:11:58.207
Not to mention they're annoying!

00:11:58.249 --> 00:12:01.043
Hold on tight everyone! Ah!

00:12:01.085 --> 00:12:02.628
(Mimi cries)

00:12:02.628 --> 00:12:05.047
Birdramon! Prepare for landing!

00:12:05.089 --> 00:12:07.216
Greymon, help them land safely!

00:12:07.258 --> 00:12:08.259
Gotcha!

00:12:09.135 --> 00:12:10.261
Ikkakumon!

00:12:10.303 --> 00:12:11.804
Harpoon Torpedo!

00:12:13.931 --> 00:12:15.141
Made it!

00:12:15.141 --> 00:12:16.392
Gabumon!

00:12:16.434 --> 00:12:17.393
Ready.

00:12:17.435 --> 00:12:19.645
Gabumon digivolve to

00:12:19.645 --> 00:12:20.646
Garurumon!

00:12:24.275 --> 00:12:25.985
(Joe yells out)

00:12:25.985 --> 00:12:28.446
Now's your chance. Go!

00:12:28.487 --> 00:12:29.822
Appreciate it!

00:12:30.948 --> 00:12:33.117
You saved us! We owe you one.

00:12:33.159 --> 00:12:34.160
I gotcha!

00:12:35.453 --> 00:12:36.996
Well, that was interesting.

00:12:36.996 --> 00:12:38.914
That was fun, can
we do it again?

00:12:38.956 --> 00:12:41.000
But you were literally
just crying about it.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.294
(trilling)

00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:47.256
Let's help them out Palmon!

00:12:47.298 --> 00:12:49.342
Palmon digivolve to

00:12:49.342 --> 00:12:50.926
Togemon!

00:12:50.968 --> 00:12:52.011
Needle Spray!

00:12:55.973 --> 00:12:57.433
(echoing ding)

00:12:57.475 --> 00:13:00.019
(low chirping)

00:13:01.312 --> 00:13:02.438
Now what?

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:04.106
What the?

00:13:04.148 --> 00:13:07.193
(mountains cracking)

00:13:10.154 --> 00:13:11.155
(explosion)

00:13:11.364 --> 00:13:13.199
I think I'll just
stay over here.

00:13:16.827 --> 00:13:20.039
(intense music builds)

00:13:22.208 --> 00:13:24.669
(screams)

00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:27.338
You've gotta be kidding.

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:30.966
What is that?

00:13:39.141 --> 00:13:40.518
(computer bell tone)

00:13:41.519 --> 00:13:42.853
(breath shaking)

00:13:47.441 --> 00:13:49.694
(low growl)

00:13:55.783 --> 00:13:57.493
(Tortomon squealing)

00:13:58.494 --> 00:13:59.578
Uh, brutal.

00:14:00.746 --> 00:14:03.499
Ahh! It's survival
of the fittest!

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:07.503
(shattering sound)

00:14:07.545 --> 00:14:11.048
[Izzy] That's Groundramon. He
must be an Ultimate Digimon.

00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:12.550
Now that he's eaten Tortomon,

00:14:12.591 --> 00:14:15.428
his body energy
is rapidly rising!

00:14:16.929 --> 00:14:19.807
(gasps) Back when we were
crossing the ocean, we saw

00:14:19.849 --> 00:14:24.103
a Seadramon digivolve after
eating another Digimon!

00:14:26.897 --> 00:14:30.484
They store the energy so
they can digivolve further!

00:14:30.526 --> 00:14:32.862
(shatters)

00:14:33.612 --> 00:14:36.699
[Kabuterimon] Looks like
Groundramon's targeting us!

00:14:36.741 --> 00:14:38.659
[Togemon] So are we
on the menu next?

00:14:38.701 --> 00:14:40.411
[Birdramon] Sure is
what it looks like.

00:14:40.828 --> 00:14:42.496
Are you telling me this place is

00:14:42.538 --> 00:14:45.166
even more dangerous
than the last one?

00:14:45.207 --> 00:14:47.168
If we don't take
this thing down,

00:14:47.209 --> 00:14:48.586
we'll never move forward.

00:14:48.627 --> 00:14:51.088
Try not to become an appetizer.

00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:53.382
Right back at ya.

00:14:53.424 --> 00:14:55.760
(rumbling)

00:14:55.801 --> 00:14:56.969
Quick everyone, scatter!

00:15:00.389 --> 00:15:03.100
(ground blasts)

00:15:03.142 --> 00:15:05.060
(Digimon exclaim)

00:15:05.102 --> 00:15:07.021
-Togemon!
-No, Ikkakumon!

00:15:07.062 --> 00:15:08.439
(Mimi cries out)

00:15:08.481 --> 00:15:13.068
Let me go right now or you'll
regret it! Needle Spray!

00:15:14.445 --> 00:15:17.907
It's not working,
he's too strong! Ahh!

00:15:19.074 --> 00:15:21.118
I assure you I am
not that tasty!

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:22.620
Ahh!

00:15:22.661 --> 00:15:27.583
-Greymon digivolve to...
-Garurumon digivolve to...

00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:32.671
-Birdramon digivolve to...
-Kabuterimon digivolve to...

00:15:33.255 --> 00:15:34.423
Metalgreymon!

00:15:36.425 --> 00:15:37.760
Weregarurumon!

00:15:39.011 --> 00:15:40.012
Garudamon!

00:15:41.347 --> 00:15:42.848
MegaKabuterimon!

00:15:44.308 --> 00:15:46.393
(whooshing)

00:15:46.435 --> 00:15:48.270
(gasps) Whoa.

00:15:48.312 --> 00:15:49.438
Trident Arm!

00:15:52.441 --> 00:15:53.818
Now's your chance Izzy!

00:15:53.859 --> 00:15:54.860
[Izzy] Right!

00:15:55.194 --> 00:15:56.862
Horn Blaster!

00:15:59.782 --> 00:16:00.783
Wolf Claw!

00:16:03.202 --> 00:16:04.662
(laser sound)

00:16:04.703 --> 00:16:09.124
-Togemon digivolve to...
-Ikkakumon digivolve to...

00:16:11.126 --> 00:16:12.127
Lilymon!

00:16:13.003 --> 00:16:14.004
Zudomon!

00:16:15.172 --> 00:16:16.131
All right!

00:16:16.173 --> 00:16:19.593
Now it's our turn
Lilymon! Let 'em have it!

00:16:19.635 --> 00:16:20.970
Flower Cannon!

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:24.181
Vulcan's Hammer!

00:16:29.186 --> 00:16:30.479
Huh?

00:16:30.521 --> 00:16:31.522
My turn.

00:16:33.232 --> 00:16:35.359
(shouts)

00:16:37.319 --> 00:16:39.905
(battle music)

00:16:42.157 --> 00:16:43.325
Did it work?

00:16:44.243 --> 00:16:46.036
Watch out!

00:16:46.078 --> 00:16:51.000
(powering up noise and
electricity crackle)

00:16:52.209 --> 00:16:54.753
(all shouting)

00:16:59.049 --> 00:17:00.843
Matt, are you okay?

00:17:02.177 --> 00:17:06.181
Don't you worry, TK.
We're gonna be just fine.

00:17:09.393 --> 00:17:10.352
Are you okay?

00:17:10.394 --> 00:17:11.979
Hanging in there.

00:17:12.021 --> 00:17:14.273
(roars)

00:17:14.315 --> 00:17:15.566
Oh no, watch out!

00:17:15.608 --> 00:17:18.402
Get back, Sora! Wing Blade!

00:17:20.905 --> 00:17:23.282
(battle cry)

00:17:25.451 --> 00:17:27.077
-Garudamon!
-Ugh!

00:17:28.370 --> 00:17:30.080
Ugh that went well.

00:17:30.122 --> 00:17:31.749
[Matt] Aim for the sides!

00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:33.375
Got it.

00:17:33.417 --> 00:17:35.628
(whirring)

00:17:36.795 --> 00:17:39.381
Attacks on its skin won't work!

00:17:40.299 --> 00:17:42.301
Maybe it's like armor!

00:17:43.969 --> 00:17:46.972
Even so. Let's do
it Metalgreymon!

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:48.641
Right!

00:17:55.397 --> 00:17:56.398
(grunts)

00:17:58.317 --> 00:18:00.069
(electricity crackles)

00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:02.529
(screams)

00:18:02.571 --> 00:18:03.572
Tai.

00:18:11.246 --> 00:18:13.248
(roars)

00:18:14.291 --> 00:18:17.586
(singing in Japanese)

00:18:21.465 --> 00:18:24.259
Okay, once I'm able to
open Groundramon's mouth,

00:18:24.301 --> 00:18:26.428
hit him with
everything you've got!

00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:33.686
(powering up noises)

00:18:33.727 --> 00:18:36.355
Eat this!

00:18:36.814 --> 00:18:39.608
(metal whirring)

00:18:45.781 --> 00:18:47.825
Now, you guys!

00:18:47.866 --> 00:18:49.410
Grr ah!

00:18:49.451 --> 00:18:50.536
Horn Buster!

00:18:51.495 --> 00:18:52.538
Wing Blade!

00:18:53.539 --> 00:18:54.873
Flower Cannon!

00:18:56.041 --> 00:18:57.543
Vulcan's Hammer!

00:18:59.294 --> 00:19:02.798
(Japanese song continues)

00:19:07.219 --> 00:19:09.805
(whistle tone)

00:19:11.682 --> 00:19:12.975
Giga Blaster!

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:23.736
(explosion)

00:19:27.072 --> 00:19:29.533
(song ends)

00:19:29.575 --> 00:19:32.453
I can't believe it.
It actually worked!

00:19:32.494 --> 00:19:34.038
(laughs in relief)

00:19:34.079 --> 00:19:36.373
Coming across an enemy
as difficult as this

00:19:36.415 --> 00:19:39.043
right off the bat is bad news.

00:19:39.084 --> 00:19:40.878
If all the Digimon
on this continent

00:19:40.919 --> 00:19:44.298
are at a similar
level to this, then...

00:19:44.339 --> 00:19:45.966
(blast noise)

00:19:46.008 --> 00:19:48.010
(gasps)

00:19:50.512 --> 00:19:54.099
(metal clanging footsteps)

00:19:58.103 --> 00:20:00.064
[Matt] AxelKnightmon.

00:20:03.067 --> 00:20:04.818
[Sora] Who is that?

00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:08.280
[Tai] He once tried to turn
Patamon into a Dark Digimon.

00:20:09.114 --> 00:20:10.824
What's he doing here?

00:20:10.866 --> 00:20:13.786
[Joe] So just to clarify,
he's not on our side, right?

00:20:13.827 --> 00:20:15.704
[Mimi] One thing after
another in this place!

00:20:15.746 --> 00:20:17.122
What is the deal?

00:20:20.793 --> 00:20:23.879
(everyone screaming)

00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:27.508
Come on, everyone!

00:20:27.549 --> 00:20:30.260
Agumon, you sure you can fight?

00:20:34.890 --> 00:20:37.935
(clang and whirring)

00:20:39.144 --> 00:20:42.231
(clanging footsteps)

00:20:47.152 --> 00:20:50.030
(wings flapping)

00:20:50.072 --> 00:20:51.115
TK!

00:20:51.156 --> 00:20:52.699
Patamon, wait!

00:20:52.741 --> 00:20:55.119
Leave him to us.
We're gonna fight!

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:57.621
All of you have
protected us enough!

00:20:57.663 --> 00:21:00.749
(digivice powers up)

00:21:02.167 --> 00:21:05.129
(magical whirring)

00:21:06.588 --> 00:21:08.674
Patamon digivolve to...

00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:15.139
(gentle bell noises)

00:21:16.515 --> 00:21:18.517
(gasps)

00:21:19.601 --> 00:21:22.479
(twinkling sounds)

00:21:24.648 --> 00:21:25.649
Angemon!

00:21:29.111 --> 00:21:32.614
(soft and soothing music)

00:21:37.536 --> 00:21:39.163
(music ends)

00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:40.539

[Izzy] Next up on the
Digimon Encyclopedia is...

00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:46.688
Patamon! This Digimon
is TK's partner.

00:22:47.022 --> 00:22:48.398
Patamon flaps through the sky

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:51.944
and inhales air with its entire
body to fire Boom Bubble.

00:22:52.778 --> 00:22:55.489
Now, check this out.
Animals with big ears

00:22:55.530 --> 00:22:57.866
find it hard to focus
from hearing too much.

00:22:57.908 --> 00:23:00.577
But Patamon can tolerate
up to 80 decibels,

00:23:00.619 --> 00:23:02.496
the noise level of a train!

00:23:02.537 --> 00:23:04.706
Wait, are those even ears?

00:23:06.959 --> 00:23:09.336
Which Digimon will
it be next time?

00:23:10.170 --> 00:23:11.588
-(adventure music begins)
-[Narrator] The children

00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:14.424
are separated and
fight for survival.

00:23:14.466 --> 00:23:17.344
Will Tai and Agumon
be able to persevere?

00:23:17.386 --> 00:23:19.263
[Tai] Next time on
Digimon Adventure,

00:23:19.304 --> 00:23:21.098
