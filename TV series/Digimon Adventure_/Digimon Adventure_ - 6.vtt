[Narrator] In the year 2020 CE

00:00:14.815 --> 00:00:18.386
the human world is
connected by a network.

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:23.057
That network is inhabited
by an unknown life form

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:24.292
called Digimon.

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:28.329

00:00:35.002 --> 00:00:38.339

(gentle upbeat music)

00:02:16.587 --> 00:02:19.123
Darkness has started
making its move

00:02:19.156 --> 00:02:22.593
and the Celestial
Digimon must stop it.

00:02:22.626 --> 00:02:24.562
As they learn of their mission

00:02:24.595 --> 00:02:28.299
Tai's party is targeted
by a swarm of Digimon.

00:02:28.332 --> 00:02:30.935
(laser zapping)

00:02:30.968 --> 00:02:33.938
(suspenseful music)

00:02:36.006 --> 00:02:38.609
Danger also closes in on Izzy

00:02:38.642 --> 00:02:40.311
who is moving
through the network.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.917
At that moment, Tentomon
evolves into Kabuterimon

00:02:46.951 --> 00:02:48.953
and succeeds in protecting Izzy.

00:02:49.787 --> 00:02:52.790
(suspenseful music)

00:02:56.627 --> 00:02:59.163
(upbeat music)

00:03:03.534 --> 00:03:07.805
Tai's party who also escaped
attack set out to cross the sea

00:03:07.838 --> 00:03:11.342
to the continent where the
Celestial Digimon awaits.

00:03:11.375 --> 00:03:14.545
(gentle upbeat music)

00:03:17.381 --> 00:03:19.784
Hmm, where's the sea?

00:03:19.817 --> 00:03:20.818
Hmm.

00:03:22.887 --> 00:03:25.289
(gentle music)

00:03:25.322 --> 00:03:27.858
(birds chirping)

00:03:27.892 --> 00:03:32.530
"We have 72 hours until
Tokyo comes to a total stop."

00:03:32.563 --> 00:03:34.999
How long has it already
been since he said that?

00:03:35.866 --> 00:03:38.369
(Tai screams)

00:03:39.837 --> 00:03:42.039
It's no use, we can't
see it from here.

00:03:42.072 --> 00:03:43.340
I know.

00:03:43.374 --> 00:03:44.842
(Tai stomach rumbles)

00:03:44.875 --> 00:03:45.876
Whoa.

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:48.479
I second that, I'm hungry too.

00:03:48.512 --> 00:03:49.480
(Agumon stomach rumbles)

00:03:49.513 --> 00:03:50.581
[Both] Huh?

00:03:51.582 --> 00:03:53.017
(Agumon sighs)

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.886
So Digimon's stomachs are
louder than people's stomachs?

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.521
I admit I'm starving too.

00:03:57.555 --> 00:04:00.057
We're gonna have to find
ourselves some food and soon.

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.159
-Yeah.
-Hey, wait.

00:04:02.193 --> 00:04:03.360
(whimsical music)

00:04:03.394 --> 00:04:05.663
Something over there
smells delicious.

00:04:05.696 --> 00:04:09.033
(Agumon and Biyomon
laughing excitedly)

00:04:09.066 --> 00:04:11.068
-Whoa.
-Those look so yummy.

00:04:11.101 --> 00:04:12.069
(gentle upbeat music)

00:04:12.102 --> 00:04:13.237
Could that be?

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:14.738
(Mimi snickering)

00:04:14.772 --> 00:04:16.740
(gentle upbeat music)

00:04:16.774 --> 00:04:19.844
-(group screaming)
-(suspenseful music)

00:04:19.877 --> 00:04:21.579
They all fell for it.

00:04:21.612 --> 00:04:24.081
(suspenseful music)

00:04:24.114 --> 00:04:26.550
That'll teach you,
you fruit thieves.

00:04:26.584 --> 00:04:28.519
(suspenseful music)

00:04:28.552 --> 00:04:31.555
(Tanemons chittering)

00:04:31.589 --> 00:04:33.858
Looks like we've been
caught in somebody's trap.

00:04:33.891 --> 00:04:35.593
Yeah, right, but caught by what?

00:04:35.626 --> 00:04:37.094
They're Tanemon.

00:04:37.127 --> 00:04:38.195
(Tanemons chittering)

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:40.698
Hey wait a second, guys

00:04:40.731 --> 00:04:42.566
We haven't done anything wrong.

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.268
Oh, yes you have.

00:04:44.301 --> 00:04:46.937
You came over here and
were gonna steal our fruit.

00:04:46.971 --> 00:04:49.240
Let's see what you
caught, Palmon.

00:04:50.307 --> 00:04:51.542
(all gasping)

00:04:51.575 --> 00:04:54.211
All fruit thieves
deserve punishment

00:04:54.245 --> 00:04:56.280
and you're no different.

00:04:56.313 --> 00:04:57.448
[All] Are you human?

00:04:58.749 --> 00:04:59.717
Huh?

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.820
(tense upbeat music)

00:05:04.655 --> 00:05:07.091
(Tanemons squeaking excitedly)

00:05:07.124 --> 00:05:10.160
(tense upbeat music)

00:05:14.932 --> 00:05:18.068
Welcome strangers
to Mimi's Kingdom.

00:05:18.102 --> 00:05:19.970
This place is your kingdom?

00:05:20.004 --> 00:05:22.573
And who exactly are you?

00:05:22.606 --> 00:05:24.074
Oh, right, I forgot.

00:05:24.108 --> 00:05:26.777
I haven't properly
introduced myself, have I?

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.281
My name is Mimi Tachikawa
and this is my garden.

00:05:30.314 --> 00:05:31.448
It's true,

00:05:31.482 --> 00:05:34.084
I'm the kind and wise queen
of this beautiful kingdom.

00:05:34.118 --> 00:05:35.586
(Tanemons squeaking excitedly)

00:05:35.619 --> 00:05:38.188
How did she become the queen?

00:05:39.356 --> 00:05:42.593
And this is Palmon,
my devoted butler.

00:05:42.626 --> 00:05:44.461
Pleased to meet you all.

00:05:44.495 --> 00:05:46.931
But I'm still suspicious
you're with Tuskmon.

00:05:46.964 --> 00:05:48.766
Are you telling me you're not?

00:05:48.799 --> 00:05:50.801
Who's Tuskmon?

00:05:50.834 --> 00:05:52.436
I've heard about Tuskmon,

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:54.772
aren't they those big
and nasty dino thingies?

00:05:54.805 --> 00:05:57.608
They do not have good
manners, that's true.

00:05:57.641 --> 00:05:59.276
Well, that's good enough for me.

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:00.978
Let's just say it was
a misunderstanding

00:06:01.011 --> 00:06:02.479
and it's all cleared up.

00:06:02.513 --> 00:06:03.847
So, next question.

00:06:03.881 --> 00:06:06.517
What did you all come here
for if it wasn't fruit?

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:07.785
(Tai chuckles sheepishly)

00:06:07.818 --> 00:06:09.186
Well, the truth is

00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:11.989
we seem to have gotten
ourselves a little bit lost.

00:06:12.022 --> 00:06:13.357
Oh, lost, huh?

00:06:14.825 --> 00:06:18.395
(gentle suspenseful music)

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:23.367
Oh, no, looks like the damage
is spreading really fast.

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.704
And plus, wait what's this?

00:06:26.737 --> 00:06:27.972
Really?

00:06:28.005 --> 00:06:30.808
You're searching for something
called the Celestial Digimon?

00:06:30.841 --> 00:06:32.710
'Cause I think I heard a voice

00:06:32.743 --> 00:06:34.478
saying something like
that name a while ago

00:06:34.511 --> 00:06:35.512
when I was taking a nap.

00:06:35.546 --> 00:06:36.513
[All] Huh?

00:06:36.547 --> 00:06:38.015
Where did you hear it from?

00:06:39.016 --> 00:06:41.418
I think it was coming
out of this thing.

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.356
(all gasping)

00:06:48.525 --> 00:06:51.562
Check it out, Mimi here is
just like the rest of us.

00:06:51.595 --> 00:06:52.830
Digi-Destined.

00:06:52.863 --> 00:06:53.864
How about that?

00:06:54.698 --> 00:06:56.767
Wait, what Digi-Destined?

00:06:58.602 --> 00:06:59.903
No, no, no, not now.

00:07:01.038 --> 00:07:03.240
I don't wanna know, just
forget I even asked.

00:07:03.273 --> 00:07:05.743
I've got no time 'cause I
have to protect Mimi's kingdom

00:07:05.776 --> 00:07:07.378
and fight off fruit
thieves day and night.

00:07:07.411 --> 00:07:08.912
It's tough, but it's my job.

00:07:08.946 --> 00:07:09.913
[Palmon] That's right.

00:07:09.947 --> 00:07:11.682
That's why she's the
queen of our kingdom.

00:07:11.715 --> 00:07:12.916
[All] Huh?

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:15.085
[Izzy] Tai, come in,
we have an emergency.

00:07:15.119 --> 00:07:16.353
Hey, I didn't know

00:07:16.387 --> 00:07:18.088
you could use these
things like a smartphone.

00:07:18.122 --> 00:07:19.089
(Sora chuckles)

00:07:19.123 --> 00:07:20.724
So, Izzy what's the emergency?

00:07:22.126 --> 00:07:24.762
[Izzy] Watch this video
first, then I'll explain.

00:07:24.795 --> 00:07:25.763
[Tai] A video?

00:07:25.796 --> 00:07:27.765
But the picture is not moving.

00:07:27.798 --> 00:07:28.766
[Izzy] That's what
I thought it first

00:07:28.799 --> 00:07:30.067
when I tried to watch it here.

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:31.935
But wait, look closely.

00:07:31.969 --> 00:07:33.203
(gentle suspenseful music)

00:07:33.237 --> 00:07:34.405
Huh?

00:07:34.438 --> 00:07:35.873
Yeah, I see it.

00:07:35.906 --> 00:07:37.775
Watch his arm and the
sticky he's holding.

00:07:37.808 --> 00:07:40.878
[Tai] Oh, yeah, it's
moving but super slow.

00:07:40.911 --> 00:07:41.912
Hey, you're right.

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:45.049
It's like it's in slow
motion or something.

00:07:45.082 --> 00:07:46.083
No, it's not.

00:07:46.784 --> 00:07:48.085
That's what I thought at first

00:07:48.118 --> 00:07:49.553
and I can't explain
it completely

00:07:49.586 --> 00:07:52.423
but one thing I know for
sure from studying this video

00:07:52.456 --> 00:07:54.058
is that time seems to
flow at different speeds

00:07:54.091 --> 00:07:55.759
between our world and
the Digital World.

00:07:55.793 --> 00:07:57.386
But how does that work?

00:08:00.998 --> 00:08:04.334
(gentle dramatic music)

00:08:11.775 --> 00:08:14.511
(dramatic music)

00:08:28.525 --> 00:08:30.494
-(Tuskmon growling)
-(upbeat dramatic music)

00:08:30.527 --> 00:08:33.330
Find me the children.

00:08:34.698 --> 00:08:35.999
Is that really true?

00:08:37.134 --> 00:08:38.368
That's so weird.

00:08:38.402 --> 00:08:40.637
How could time go a different
speed here than in our world?

00:08:40.671 --> 00:08:41.672
You sure?

00:08:42.139 --> 00:08:44.007
I haven't been able
to verify it yet

00:08:44.041 --> 00:08:45.509
but I'm pretty sure I'm right.

00:08:45.542 --> 00:08:48.779
What we saw before was just
the surface of this world.

00:08:48.812 --> 00:08:50.781
I'm starting to think
this whole region

00:08:50.814 --> 00:08:52.783
is beyond the
knowledge of mankind

00:08:52.816 --> 00:08:55.652
or whoever it was who
originally created the network.

00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:59.523
The deeper you go, the
greater the timeline

00:08:59.556 --> 00:09:01.658
between the digital
world and our world.

00:09:02.826 --> 00:09:04.695
And not only that, I
believe our Digivices

00:09:04.728 --> 00:09:06.463
must have been fixing
that lag somehow

00:09:06.497 --> 00:09:07.865
to enable two-way communication

00:09:07.898 --> 00:09:10.634
or we'd never be able to talk
to each other in real time.

00:09:10.667 --> 00:09:13.170
So Izzy, about that
time difference?

00:09:13.203 --> 00:09:16.306
Since the video you showed us
looks like it's running slow

00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:19.209
then for us here,
does that mean?

00:09:19.243 --> 00:09:22.379
Yeah, compared to the time
passing in the digital world,

00:09:22.412 --> 00:09:23.547
where you are now,

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:25.482
time in our world
is moving so slowly

00:09:25.516 --> 00:09:26.884
it looks like it's frozen.

00:09:26.917 --> 00:09:30.020
So, sounds like Mimi's been
here for a long time already.

00:09:30.053 --> 00:09:31.722
But in human world time,

00:09:31.755 --> 00:09:33.690
she was actually
transported to this world

00:09:33.724 --> 00:09:35.392
just a little while
before we were.

00:09:35.425 --> 00:09:37.594
I guess you're probably
right about that.

00:09:38.695 --> 00:09:40.063
I think this is good news.

00:09:40.097 --> 00:09:41.899
Because now it looks
like we have more time

00:09:41.932 --> 00:09:43.667
than we thought we did at first.

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:44.902
But still...

00:09:44.935 --> 00:09:47.404
Right, we still
have to move fast.

00:09:47.437 --> 00:09:48.839
-Here. (Digivice beeps)
-[All] Huh?

00:09:48.872 --> 00:09:50.340
Please, take a look at this.

00:09:50.374 --> 00:09:51.675
I've encoded that news video

00:09:51.708 --> 00:09:53.877
so you guys can watch
it on your side.

00:09:55.379 --> 00:09:57.881
Huh, I think he's
talking about our town.

00:09:59.082 --> 00:10:01.418
The power failure in the
city continues to spread

00:10:01.451 --> 00:10:04.188
and authorities so far
have no explanations.

00:10:04.221 --> 00:10:06.356
In response, the government
has begun setting up

00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:08.692
mobile power generators
at hospitals,

00:10:08.725 --> 00:10:09.693
broadcasting stations,

00:10:09.726 --> 00:10:12.062
and other essential facilities.

00:10:12.095 --> 00:10:13.096
Whoa.

00:10:15.299 --> 00:10:17.434
As you can see the
damage is already bad

00:10:17.467 --> 00:10:18.735
and it's still spreading.

00:10:19.803 --> 00:10:22.706
Oh, poor Tokyo.

00:10:22.739 --> 00:10:25.609
I had no idea the city
was in such trouble.

00:10:25.642 --> 00:10:26.877
[Newscaster] The
mobile power generators

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:28.278
are apparently being lent out

00:10:28.312 --> 00:10:30.614
by certain companies
free of charge.

00:10:30.647 --> 00:10:31.915
Huh, my grandpa.

00:10:33.116 --> 00:10:34.885
That guy is your grandpa?

00:10:34.918 --> 00:10:36.053
Hey, I've seen him.

00:10:36.086 --> 00:10:39.056
That mans the Chairman of
Tachikawa Heavy Industries.

00:10:39.089 --> 00:10:40.958
He's the Chairman.

00:10:40.991 --> 00:10:43.560
This isn't the time to be
concerned about company profits.

00:10:43.594 --> 00:10:46.630
I just want to do whatever
I can to help out right now

00:10:46.663 --> 00:10:48.265
as I think we all should.

00:10:48.298 --> 00:10:49.466
Oh, grandpa.

00:10:51.435 --> 00:10:53.437
He's right I need to think about

00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:55.439
what I can do to help out too.

00:10:57.841 --> 00:10:59.109
It disappeared.

00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:02.646
Grandpa, I see how
hard you're working.

00:11:02.679 --> 00:11:05.582
(somber music)

00:11:05.616 --> 00:11:06.984
(Tanemon squeaking)

00:11:07.017 --> 00:11:11.622
But right now, I have all these
little guys to think about.

00:11:12.623 --> 00:11:14.358
They're my kingdom.

00:11:15.659 --> 00:11:17.327
And the job I've taken on here,

00:11:17.361 --> 00:11:20.097
protecting them from bad guys
is what's most important.

00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:21.832
(Tanemon cheering)

00:11:21.865 --> 00:11:22.966
That's right.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.669
And our kingdom's queen
would never just abandon us.

00:11:25.702 --> 00:11:27.271
(Tanemon cheering)

00:11:27.304 --> 00:11:29.106
Listen Mimi,

00:11:29.139 --> 00:11:31.441
aagh, I mean queen

00:11:31.475 --> 00:11:33.176
how about the four of
us join up with you

00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:34.845
against those bad guys?

00:11:34.878 --> 00:11:37.614
Let us help you out and we can
get rid of 'em all together.

00:11:37.648 --> 00:11:38.615
What?

00:11:38.649 --> 00:11:40.117
We all to help you protect them?

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:41.618
Just think how
much more we can do

00:11:41.652 --> 00:11:42.853
if we all fight together.

00:11:42.886 --> 00:11:44.621
I'll fight on your side too.

00:11:44.655 --> 00:11:48.225
You would all fight to
protect me and my kingdom?

00:11:49.559 --> 00:11:52.362
We all gotta do
whatever we can, right?

00:11:52.396 --> 00:11:55.032
(Mimi whimpers)

00:11:55.065 --> 00:11:57.334
[Mimi] Okay, then
you're number 72.

00:11:57.367 --> 00:11:58.335
Huh?

00:11:58.368 --> 00:12:00.370
[Mimi] And you're Number 73.

00:12:00.404 --> 00:12:01.371
I'm what?

00:12:01.405 --> 00:12:03.340
You are all hereby
named servants

00:12:03.507 --> 00:12:05.342
of Mimi's happy Kingdom.

00:12:06.343 --> 00:12:07.711
(Sora gasps)

00:12:07.744 --> 00:12:09.513
(Tanemon cheering)

00:12:09.546 --> 00:12:11.214
(Tai gasps)

00:12:11.248 --> 00:12:14.184
(Tanemon cheering)

00:12:18.055 --> 00:12:21.325
(gentle lilting music)

00:12:21.358 --> 00:12:24.561
(tense dramatic music)

00:12:24.594 --> 00:12:26.663
(Tanemon squeaking)

00:12:26.697 --> 00:12:28.332
(tense dramatic music)

00:12:28.365 --> 00:12:29.700
(Tanemon squeaking)

00:12:29.733 --> 00:12:30.701
(tense dramatic music)

00:12:30.734 --> 00:12:32.869
(Tanemon squeaking)

00:12:32.903 --> 00:12:33.904
They're here.

00:12:34.871 --> 00:12:36.740
Six Tuskmon here, eh.

00:12:36.773 --> 00:12:39.009
Well, we're gonna capture
those nasty fruit thieves

00:12:39.042 --> 00:12:40.243
for good this time.

00:12:40.277 --> 00:12:43.580
(tense dramatic music)

00:12:43.613 --> 00:12:44.915
(Ogremon laughs menacingly)

00:12:44.948 --> 00:12:46.016
Attack!

00:12:46.049 --> 00:12:49.219
(tense dramatic music)

00:12:55.792 --> 00:12:56.760
-All right.
-Yeah.

00:12:56.793 --> 00:12:58.228
We got two of them.

00:12:58.261 --> 00:12:59.730
That's start for sure.

00:12:59.763 --> 00:13:02.966
(tense dramatic music)

00:13:05.802 --> 00:13:06.937
The rest are going around,

00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:08.772
how are we ever
gonna stop them now?

00:13:08.805 --> 00:13:09.873
(tense dramatic music)

00:13:09.906 --> 00:13:11.708
I've got an idea, come on.

00:13:11.742 --> 00:13:12.709
Right.

00:13:12.743 --> 00:13:13.877
We're all counting on you.

00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:17.280
(Tanemon cheering)

00:13:17.314 --> 00:13:19.783

(Tuskmon growling)

00:13:30.093 --> 00:13:31.061
Agumon!

00:13:31.094 --> 00:13:32.095
Leave it to me.

00:13:32.129 --> 00:13:35.599
(bright energetic music)

00:13:50.614 --> 00:13:51.581
Agumon.

00:13:51.615 --> 00:13:52.749
Digivolve to.

00:13:52.783 --> 00:13:56.153

(Greymon roars ferociously)

00:14:14.538 --> 00:14:16.106
(suspenseful music)

00:14:16.139 --> 00:14:17.107
(Greymon groans)

00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:18.141
Greymon!

00:14:22.212 --> 00:14:23.313
Nova Blast!

00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:29.820
Sounds like it started.

00:14:29.853 --> 00:14:32.355
Wait, what's that thing?

00:14:32.389 --> 00:14:33.824
(Palmon gasps)

00:14:33.857 --> 00:14:34.825

00:14:34.858 --> 00:14:35.859
Mm.

00:14:39.329 --> 00:14:40.564
Only two more to go.

00:14:41.565 --> 00:14:42.966

(dramatic upbeat music)

00:14:51.374 --> 00:14:52.342
This is not good.

00:14:52.375 --> 00:14:53.343
(dramatic upbeat music)

00:14:53.376 --> 00:14:54.344
Greymon!

00:14:54.377 --> 00:14:55.345
Huh?

00:14:55.378 --> 00:14:56.346
No way.

00:14:56.379 --> 00:14:59.716
(dramatic upbeat music)

00:15:00.851 --> 00:15:02.319

00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:11.495
All right, Birdramon.

(dramatic upbeat music)

00:15:17.267 --> 00:15:19.236

00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:34.417
Are you worried?

00:15:34.451 --> 00:15:36.753
Huh?

00:15:36.786 --> 00:15:38.221
A little bit, I guess.

00:15:39.389 --> 00:15:40.857
Don't be scared.

00:15:40.891 --> 00:15:43.093
I'll protect you no
matter what my queen.

00:15:44.094 --> 00:15:45.896

my poison ivy attack.

00:17:09.271 --> 00:17:10.472
(dramatic upbeat music)

00:17:10.505 --> 00:17:12.240
(Tai screams)

00:17:12.274 --> 00:17:15.610
(dramatic upbeat music)

00:17:16.511 --> 00:17:18.980
That takes care of that problem.

00:17:19.014 --> 00:17:20.915
All right, you
know what they say?

00:17:20.949 --> 00:17:23.318
Teamwork makes the dream work.

00:17:23.351 --> 00:17:25.453
(dramatic upbeat music)

00:17:25.487 --> 00:17:28.156
(tense suspenseful music)

00:17:28.189 --> 00:17:29.658
[Mimi] Palmon!

00:17:29.691 --> 00:17:30.692
Oh, no.

00:17:31.459 --> 00:17:33.828
What? (gasps)

00:17:33.862 --> 00:17:35.597
(Palmon moans)

00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:38.333
Mimi, you have to
get away from here.

00:17:38.366 --> 00:17:40.268
No, I won't leave you.

00:17:40.302 --> 00:17:43.171
But you're the one they're
after, save yourself.

00:17:43.204 --> 00:17:44.306
Oh, Palmon.

00:17:45.206 --> 00:17:47.642
These children are Digidestined.

00:17:48.543 --> 00:17:50.178
Go before it's too late.

00:17:50.211 --> 00:17:51.646
You have to get outta here.

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:53.014
There's no way
I'm gonna run away

00:17:53.048 --> 00:17:55.350
and just leave you
behind, Palmon.

00:17:55.383 --> 00:17:57.986
I could never do that to you.

00:17:58.019 --> 00:18:00.955
(somber music)

00:18:00.989 --> 00:18:02.490
When I first arrived here,

00:18:02.524 --> 00:18:04.526
I was so lonely
and all by myself.

00:18:04.559 --> 00:18:09.564
But then you found me and you
introduced me to the Tanemon

00:18:09.898 --> 00:18:11.733
so that they'd be
my friends too.

00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:14.969
This was all thanks
to you, Palmon.

00:18:15.003 --> 00:18:16.204
Oh, Mimi.

00:18:16.237 --> 00:18:19.207
That's why I could
never abandon you.

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:21.309
Oh, Mimi.

00:18:21.343 --> 00:18:23.044
(Mimi sniffles)

00:18:23.078 --> 00:18:24.045
Huh?

00:18:24.079 --> 00:18:26.915
(whimsical music)

00:18:28.516 --> 00:18:30.018
What's happening?

00:18:30.051 --> 00:18:32.687
(whimsical music)

00:18:32.721 --> 00:18:35.390
(Ogremon roars)

00:18:37.258 --> 00:18:40.428
(gentle upbeat music)

00:18:41.529 --> 00:18:42.530
Huh?

00:18:47.702 --> 00:18:49.671
Palmon digivolve to

00:18:49.704 --> 00:18:53.108
(high energy rock music)

00:19:03.885 --> 00:19:05.920
(singing in Japanese)

00:19:05.954 --> 00:19:07.389
Togemon!

00:19:08.256 --> 00:19:09.724
Togemon?

00:19:09.758 --> 00:19:12.694
So this is what
Palmon changes into.

00:19:12.727 --> 00:19:14.929
This is digivolution.

00:19:14.963 --> 00:19:16.398
Digivolution?

00:19:16.431 --> 00:19:18.566
We'll see about that.

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:20.902
(Ogremon roars)

00:19:20.935 --> 00:19:23.705
(singing in Japanese)

00:19:23.738 --> 00:19:26.207
Thought you'd
sneak up on me, eh?

00:19:26.241 --> 00:19:28.209
(Ogremon roars)

00:19:28.243 --> 00:19:32.247
(singing in Japanese)

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:34.382
I got you covered.

00:19:34.416 --> 00:19:36.217
Yeah, you get him Greymon.

00:19:36.251 --> 00:19:37.752
(singing in Japanese)

00:19:37.786 --> 00:19:39.287
(Greymon roars ferociously)

00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:40.755
(Ogremon roars)

00:19:40.789 --> 00:19:44.459
(singing in Japanese)

00:19:58.006 --> 00:19:58.973
Way to go!

00:19:59.007 --> 00:20:00.241
Yeah, but look.

00:20:00.275 --> 00:20:01.409
(Tai gasps)

00:20:01.443 --> 00:20:04.078
(high energy rock music)

00:20:04.112 --> 00:20:05.113
Togemon!

00:20:07.315 --> 00:20:10.819
(singing in Japanese)

00:20:10.852 --> 00:20:11.820
Not bad.

00:20:11.853 --> 00:20:13.488
Keep it up Togemon.

00:20:13.521 --> 00:20:14.923
Needle Spray.

00:20:14.956 --> 00:20:18.626
(music in foreign language)

00:20:20.028 --> 00:20:21.996
Coconut Upper.

00:20:22.030 --> 00:20:25.700
(singing in Japanese)

00:20:28.136 --> 00:20:29.771
Whoa, knocked out cold.

00:20:29.804 --> 00:20:33.174
(high energy rock music)

00:20:36.344 --> 00:20:37.345
You okay, Mimi?

00:20:37.378 --> 00:20:38.847
Man, that was intense.

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:40.815
(Sora and Tai gasping)

00:20:40.849 --> 00:20:43.985
(gentle upbeat music)

00:20:45.854 --> 00:20:48.356
Oh wow, you were amazing.

00:20:48.389 --> 00:20:50.992
I'm just glad you're okay, Mimi.

00:20:51.025 --> 00:20:52.193
-Palmon.
-Mimi.

00:20:52.227 --> 00:20:54.696
(Mimi and Palmon
laughing happily)

00:20:54.729 --> 00:20:57.131
(all laughing)

00:20:57.165 --> 00:21:01.002
You know, I just love
you so so much Palmon.

00:21:01.035 --> 00:21:04.839
Love you too just
as much, maybe more.

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:09.410
(Mimi and Palmon
sob emotionally)

00:21:11.579 --> 00:21:14.349
(Ogremon groans)

00:21:18.052 --> 00:21:21.990
(Ogremon screams angrily)

00:21:22.023 --> 00:21:25.093
(gentle piano music)

00:21:30.698 --> 00:21:32.567
Are you sure you
want to do this?

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:33.835
Yeah.

00:21:33.868 --> 00:21:34.836
(Mimi sighs)

00:21:34.869 --> 00:21:38.172
(gentle music)

00:21:38.206 --> 00:21:41.576
After all, with your help we
finally got rid of the bad guys

00:21:41.609 --> 00:21:44.379
who were attacking the
village and the Tanemon say

00:21:44.412 --> 00:21:47.348
they can protect the kingdom
themselves from now on.

00:21:47.382 --> 00:21:49.884
(gentle music)

00:21:51.085 --> 00:21:56.090
And now, it's time to do
what I can do, right?

00:21:56.291 --> 00:21:57.926
(gentle upbeat music)

00:21:57.959 --> 00:21:59.527
