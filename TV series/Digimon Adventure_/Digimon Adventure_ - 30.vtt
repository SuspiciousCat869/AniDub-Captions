[Narrator] This is
the mysterious world

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:46.114
where Digimon live,
the Digital World.

00:01:46.156 --> 00:01:48.783
Tai Kamiya and the rest
of the Digi-destined,

00:01:48.825 --> 00:01:51.953
journey onward to a new
stage in their adventure

00:01:51.995 --> 00:01:54.206
along with their
Digimon partners.

00:01:55.207 --> 00:01:57.667
After an accident happened
during a rocket launch

00:01:57.709 --> 00:02:00.837
in the real world, something
was about to happen

00:02:00.879 --> 00:02:02.297
in the Digital World.

00:02:02.339 --> 00:02:04.841
(tense music)

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:08.136
On their quest to rescue Kari,

00:02:08.178 --> 00:02:11.139
Tai and Agumon encountered
a community of Digimon

00:02:11.181 --> 00:02:13.850
living in a jungle,
whose peaceful existence

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.685
was being threatened.

00:02:15.727 --> 00:02:18.396
(Allomon roars)

00:02:19.522 --> 00:02:20.857
(glass shattering)

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:24.319
Tai and Agumon fought
alongside Sora and Garudamon.

00:02:24.361 --> 00:02:25.987
(laser pulsing)

00:02:26.029 --> 00:02:27.030
However.

00:02:29.241 --> 00:02:32.202
(glass shattering)

00:02:33.536 --> 00:02:36.373

(tense music)

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.094
[Garudamon] Wing Blade!

00:02:50.428 --> 00:02:53.056
(glass shattering)

00:02:53.056 --> 00:02:55.558
(Garudamon gasps)

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.061

00:03:05.777 --> 00:03:07.362
(Garudamon cries)

00:03:07.404 --> 00:03:08.405
Wing Blade!

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.243
(cannon pops)

00:03:18.456 --> 00:03:20.917
(Garudamon grunts)

00:03:20.917 --> 00:03:22.210
Are you okay?

00:03:22.252 --> 00:03:23.920
I'm fine, Sora.

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.131
I think that was the
last of the Megadramon.

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:29.926
[Sora] Talk to me,
Tai. You still alive?

00:03:29.968 --> 00:03:33.138
Uh-huh. Somehow managed
to stay uncooked.

00:03:34.097 --> 00:03:36.933
(Woodmon chirping)

00:03:36.933 --> 00:03:38.893
(tense music)

00:03:38.935 --> 00:03:40.895
[MetalGreymon]
We'd better hurry.

00:03:40.937 --> 00:03:43.398
(fire roaring)

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.234
(giant feet stomping)

00:03:46.276 --> 00:03:47.402
(fire whooshing)

00:03:47.444 --> 00:03:48.737
There's still more!

00:03:48.778 --> 00:03:50.572
These guys refuse to let up!

00:03:50.613 --> 00:03:53.450
(dramatic music)

00:04:04.961 --> 00:04:05.962
(phone chimes)

00:04:05.962 --> 00:04:07.130
Finally!

00:04:07.172 --> 00:04:09.632
Did you hear back from
a Nigerian Prince?

00:04:09.632 --> 00:04:11.301
I asked one of my friends online

00:04:11.343 --> 00:04:12.927
to help me look up a few things.

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:14.763
I see.

00:04:14.804 --> 00:04:16.806
That explosion at
the launch site?

00:04:16.806 --> 00:04:19.142
I think it's only the beginning.

00:04:19.142 --> 00:04:21.269
Which is why... (gasps)

00:04:21.311 --> 00:04:22.270
(phones ringing)

00:04:22.312 --> 00:04:24.147
[Engineer A] It's the
same thing every time!

00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:26.816
[Engineer B] It won't accept
any commands from our side!

00:04:26.816 --> 00:04:29.652
[Izzy] There are widespread
system malfunctions

00:04:29.694 --> 00:04:32.614
from multiple satellites
around the world.

00:04:32.655 --> 00:04:33.948
Well, that can't be good!

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.159
What happens if more
of 'em break down?

00:04:36.201 --> 00:04:38.620
The amount of data being
transmitted would increase

00:04:38.661 --> 00:04:40.163
and stimulate the networks.

00:04:40.205 --> 00:04:41.664
It's a disaster
waiting to happen!

00:04:41.706 --> 00:04:44.334
(electricity crackling)

00:04:44.376 --> 00:04:46.461
That's not the only thing.

00:04:46.503 --> 00:04:48.838
It'll also make
the Digimon act up,

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.132
like when those tankers
got out of control!

00:04:51.174 --> 00:04:52.175
(tense music)

00:04:52.217 --> 00:04:55.011
Oh man, what a mess!

00:04:55.011 --> 00:04:56.846
But something isn't
adding up here.

00:04:56.846 --> 00:04:57.847
Huh?

00:04:58.973 --> 00:05:01.184
It's true that there's
evidence of satellite orbits

00:05:01.184 --> 00:05:02.685
altering course.

00:05:02.727 --> 00:05:03.728
Oddly enough though,

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:05.688
there's currently no
danger of any of them

00:05:05.688 --> 00:05:06.856
falling down to Earth,

00:05:06.898 --> 00:05:08.691
let alone entering
the atmosphere.

00:05:08.733 --> 00:05:10.193
Not yet anyway.

00:05:10.193 --> 00:05:13.196
Oh so we're good then? Time
to kick back and relax.

00:05:13.238 --> 00:05:16.032
Not really. There has to
be a clue I'm overlooking.

00:05:16.032 --> 00:05:17.075
What could it be?

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:22.372
[MetalGreymon] If we
can safely make it

00:05:22.372 --> 00:05:24.040
through the mountain
cave up ahead,

00:05:24.082 --> 00:05:25.875
we can escape to the other side.

00:05:27.043 --> 00:05:29.712
If Garudamon flew us over
we could do it that way.

00:05:29.712 --> 00:05:31.506
Except we might get caught

00:05:31.548 --> 00:05:33.508
since they could
target us from below.

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.927
(Tai grunts)

00:05:38.888 --> 00:05:41.724
Listen, you go on
ahead. I'll stay.

00:05:41.766 --> 00:05:42.725
(Sora gasps)

00:05:42.767 --> 00:05:44.060
There's a chance
they'll catch up to us

00:05:44.102 --> 00:05:46.354
inside the cave if we all run.

00:05:46.396 --> 00:05:48.189
It'll be better to keep
the enemies out here

00:05:48.231 --> 00:05:51.401
so MetalGreymon and
I can distract them.

00:05:51.401 --> 00:05:52.444
[MetalGreymon] That's right.

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:55.947
We'll meet up with you
on the other side, Sora.

00:05:58.741 --> 00:05:59.701
Okay, let's do it!

00:05:59.742 --> 00:06:02.620
(Allomon stomping)

00:06:03.455 --> 00:06:06.416
(Vegiemon shrieking)

00:06:06.458 --> 00:06:07.584
Giga Storm!

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.880
(lasers firing)

00:06:11.921 --> 00:06:14.424
(tense music)

00:06:16.092 --> 00:06:18.970
(Vegiemon shrieks)

00:06:20.972 --> 00:06:22.599
[Garudamon] Sora!

00:06:24.476 --> 00:06:26.311
Now's our chance,
let's get going!

00:06:31.149 --> 00:06:34.277
(Vegiemon shrieking)

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:41.618
(air whooshes)

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:47.582
(footsteps banging)

00:06:47.624 --> 00:06:49.292
Guess they took the bait.

00:06:49.334 --> 00:06:51.461
[Tai] Let's make sure
they keep on following us.

00:06:51.503 --> 00:06:54.297
(dramatic music)

00:06:57.008 --> 00:06:59.636
(air whooshes)

00:07:00.637 --> 00:07:02.305
Something's coming.

00:07:02.347 --> 00:07:04.682
(Tai gasps)

00:07:05.975 --> 00:07:07.936
Wait a sec, that
isn't Megadramon.

00:07:07.977 --> 00:07:09.312
That's a new one!

00:07:09.312 --> 00:07:10.772
Well, what do we do now?

00:07:10.813 --> 00:07:13.274
It's game over if that
thing catches Sora.

00:07:13.316 --> 00:07:14.442
Get him, MetalGreymon!

00:07:14.484 --> 00:07:15.818
On it!

00:07:15.818 --> 00:07:20.823
-(dramatic music)
-(fire whooshes)

00:07:21.991 --> 00:07:24.327
That's right, we're the
ones you wanna fight!

00:07:24.327 --> 00:07:26.663
(electricity crackling)

00:07:26.704 --> 00:07:29.832
(explosions booming)

00:07:33.044 --> 00:07:34.003
(energy crackling)

00:07:34.045 --> 00:07:37.173
(explosions booming)

00:07:38.675 --> 00:07:43.012
(Tai gasps)

00:07:45.932 --> 00:07:49.102
(menacing music)

00:07:49.143 --> 00:07:51.980
(Digivice chimes)

00:07:53.439 --> 00:07:56.150
Parrotmon. An Ultimate Digimon!

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:03.283
(Parrotmon squawks)

00:08:05.118 --> 00:08:06.286
(Izzy gasps)

00:08:06.327 --> 00:08:08.413
[Tentomon] What's
the matter now?

00:08:08.454 --> 00:08:10.081
[Engineer B] We tried
adjusting the orbit

00:08:10.123 --> 00:08:11.291
but it wasn't possible.

00:08:11.291 --> 00:08:14.127
[Engineer A] Wait. Look
at the orbital paths.

00:08:14.168 --> 00:08:16.254
Deciphering their
individual trajectories

00:08:16.296 --> 00:08:17.589
was irrelevant.

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:19.966
'Cause no matter
whose satellite it is,

00:08:20.008 --> 00:08:23.761
Japan, India, Russia,
China, or the United States,

00:08:23.803 --> 00:08:26.139
eventually all of your
orbital paths will intersect

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:27.974
at the same point.

00:08:27.974 --> 00:08:29.309
Which would be...

00:08:31.644 --> 00:08:33.771
The International Space Station!

00:08:33.813 --> 00:08:35.648
[Tentomon] No way,
that's terrible!

00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:36.816
(explosion booming)

00:08:36.858 --> 00:08:38.484
If multiple satellites
were to collide

00:08:38.526 --> 00:08:41.654
with such a massive
structure at that altitude.

00:08:41.696 --> 00:08:43.948
(comets whooshing)

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:45.825
And the resulting
debris from all of them

00:08:45.867 --> 00:08:47.994
made its way down to
the Earth's surface,

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:53.166
the impact would be the
same as a meteor strike!

00:08:53.207 --> 00:08:55.168
The subsequent damage
would be cataclysmic!

00:08:55.209 --> 00:08:57.503
(Tentomon wails)

00:08:57.545 --> 00:08:59.839
(electricity crackles)

00:08:59.881 --> 00:09:03.676
[Tai] Not more of those
sparks! Come on, MetalGreymon!

00:09:03.718 --> 00:09:05.345
Giga Storm!

00:09:05.386 --> 00:09:08.181
(lasers pulsing)

00:09:16.689 --> 00:09:18.691
(Vegiemon cackling)

00:09:21.361 --> 00:09:22.362

Well, that didn't
work out so great.

00:12:41.227 --> 00:12:44.230
So I guess Crossmon must've
spotted Sora's group.

00:12:45.439 --> 00:12:48.025
You good, Agumon? You're
still kicking, right?

00:12:48.067 --> 00:12:51.529
[Agumon] Yeah I think
so. I'll be okay.

00:12:51.571 --> 00:12:53.573
You got all your marbles, Tai?

00:12:53.614 --> 00:12:55.741
Me? I think so.

00:12:55.783 --> 00:12:56.742
Yeah.

00:12:56.784 --> 00:12:58.578
Glad to hear it.

00:12:58.578 --> 00:13:01.414
That was one superstrong
Digimon back there.

00:13:01.455 --> 00:13:04.750
Sure was. What a beast.

00:13:04.792 --> 00:13:07.503

(upbeat music)

00:13:26.147 --> 00:13:31.152
Hey Agumon, so I think I'm
starting to remember something.

00:13:31.611 --> 00:13:32.570
(Agumon snorts)

00:13:32.612 --> 00:13:34.113
(Tai groans)

00:13:34.155 --> 00:13:36.616
What happened when
we fought Devimon.

00:13:36.657 --> 00:13:38.784
After he gobbled
me up in one piece.

00:13:38.784 --> 00:13:40.494
It went dark and I blacked out.

00:13:41.621 --> 00:13:42.955
Know what though?

00:13:42.997 --> 00:13:45.416
In that moment, I could
still hear your voice,

00:13:45.458 --> 00:13:46.459
calling out my name.

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:49.128
(somber music)

00:13:50.671 --> 00:13:52.924
Yeah, that's what
I remember too.

00:13:52.965 --> 00:13:55.968
I was so scared that
I lost you forever.

00:13:55.968 --> 00:13:56.969
When that happened,

00:13:56.969 --> 00:13:59.096
it was like I stopped thinking.

00:13:59.138 --> 00:14:01.474
But then I realized
you were still alive.

00:14:02.516 --> 00:14:04.644
I coulda sworn you were
calling out for me,

00:14:04.685 --> 00:14:06.938
so I jumped out
before I knew it.

00:14:06.979 --> 00:14:08.147
And then I...

00:14:08.189 --> 00:14:11.817
And then you.. Wait,
what happened next?

00:14:11.859 --> 00:14:14.987
Don't worry about it.
It might be a mystery.

00:14:15.029 --> 00:14:17.949
But the only thing that matters
now is that we survived.

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:19.283
We can still fight!

00:14:19.325 --> 00:14:20.493
(Agumon groans)

00:14:20.534 --> 00:14:22.787
This story ain't over,
and we've still got lots

00:14:22.828 --> 00:14:24.497
of things to accomplish!

00:14:25.665 --> 00:14:27.625
And our friends do too!

00:14:27.667 --> 00:14:29.794
We don't have time
to mope around.

00:14:29.835 --> 00:14:31.671
We can't even think
of backing down.

00:14:34.048 --> 00:14:36.467
We'll never give
up, no matter what!

00:14:36.509 --> 00:14:39.679
Yeah! We'll jump back in
the brawl, again and again!

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:42.390
(Allomon snarl)

00:14:50.356 --> 00:14:52.316

00:14:52.358 --> 00:14:54.318

stylish than that tin can!"
