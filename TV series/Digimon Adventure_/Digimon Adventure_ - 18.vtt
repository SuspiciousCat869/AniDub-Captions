[Narrator] Eyesmon,

00:01:42.481 --> 00:01:46.277
the Digimon who created a fake
Tokyo in the Digital World.

00:01:46.318 --> 00:01:47.987
Digivolved into Orochimon.

00:01:49.822 --> 00:01:51.991
(shrieks)

00:01:53.075 --> 00:01:54.451
But the Digi-destined
worked together

00:01:54.493 --> 00:01:56.161
to defeat this Ultimate Digimon.

00:01:58.914 --> 00:02:01.083
(shrieks)

00:02:03.085 --> 00:02:07.256
Then suddenly, a mysterious
countdown began in both the real

00:02:07.256 --> 00:02:08.299
and fake Tokyo.

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.678
(ominous music)

00:02:15.931 --> 00:02:16.932
Huh?

00:02:22.813 --> 00:02:25.316
(Yuuko pants)

00:02:26.984 --> 00:02:29.278
[Woman] What's this
countdown? Look!

00:02:30.112 --> 00:02:32.948
(worried murmurs)

00:02:34.158 --> 00:02:35.993
[Man] Is anyone else's
phone screen flashing?

00:02:36.035 --> 00:02:38.120
[Man] Yeah mine is
too! What's going on?

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.378
(ominous music)

00:02:49.006 --> 00:02:52.676
Slowly but surely, power is
coming back to our world.

00:02:54.053 --> 00:02:57.389
But what does this
countdown mean?

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:02.645
Oh, no. That can't be good.

00:03:02.645 --> 00:03:04.021
(Palmon whimpers)

00:03:04.063 --> 00:03:07.149
(lightning crackles)

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.693
What's happening?

00:03:12.863 --> 00:03:14.990
Don't tell me it
survived all of that.

00:03:16.241 --> 00:03:17.201
You okay?

00:03:17.242 --> 00:03:18.243
Yeah.

00:03:19.036 --> 00:03:20.579
Keep your eyes open, everybody.

00:03:21.747 --> 00:03:24.667
(panicked murmurs)

00:03:26.001 --> 00:03:28.420
[Man] What's going on here?

00:03:32.716 --> 00:03:34.510
Come check this out you guys

00:03:34.551 --> 00:03:35.552
Huh?

00:03:36.512 --> 00:03:38.722
A phenomenon similar
to that spark

00:03:38.764 --> 00:03:41.600
is simultaneously occurring
in the real Tokyo too!

00:03:42.434 --> 00:03:45.604
(sparking intensifies)

00:03:50.067 --> 00:03:51.360
(grunts)

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.361
Uh-oh.

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:57.700
(gasps)

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:58.701
No way!

00:03:59.535 --> 00:04:01.036
Then it is alive?!

00:04:01.078 --> 00:04:03.122
(growls)

00:04:06.417 --> 00:04:09.211
(whimpers)

00:04:09.211 --> 00:04:10.754
This is bad!

00:04:10.796 --> 00:04:13.924
There's tons of energy
flowing from our world,

00:04:13.966 --> 00:04:17.386
straight into the
Digital world with us.

00:04:17.386 --> 00:04:19.972
(energy whirs)

00:04:23.642 --> 00:04:25.936
(all gasp)

00:04:27.062 --> 00:04:29.398
(roars)

00:04:29.398 --> 00:04:31.942
(alarm blares)

00:04:31.984 --> 00:04:34.111
-(panicked murmurs)
-What on earth is going on?

00:04:34.153 --> 00:04:35.154
Hot!

00:04:35.988 --> 00:04:38.240
[Man] My phone is burning up!

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.410
(yelps) That hurts!

00:04:47.166 --> 00:04:49.168
(roars)

00:04:51.837 --> 00:04:54.089
(all gasp)

00:04:56.008 --> 00:04:58.677
(ominous music)

00:05:09.313 --> 00:05:11.315
(roars)

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.488
(all scream)

00:05:25.162 --> 00:05:27.664
(grunts)

00:05:27.706 --> 00:05:29.708
It says, "Unreadable."

00:05:31.043 --> 00:05:32.002
(gasps)

00:05:32.044 --> 00:05:34.463
I am Nidhoggmon,

00:05:34.505 --> 00:05:39.051
a Mega Digimon that surpasses
the Ultimate Digimon.

00:05:40.511 --> 00:05:42.054
What's a Mega Digimon?

00:05:44.056 --> 00:05:45.682
One digivolve more.

00:05:45.724 --> 00:05:47.976
A level higher than an Ultimate.

00:05:47.976 --> 00:05:49.311
A Mega Digimon!!

00:05:51.897 --> 00:05:54.483
(ethereal hum)

00:05:57.194 --> 00:05:59.822
(alarm blares)

00:06:08.872 --> 00:06:09.873
Huh?

00:06:12.709 --> 00:06:14.211
Is that you, Matt?

00:06:16.839 --> 00:06:20.175
(lightning sparks)

00:06:20.175 --> 00:06:22.845
(ominous music)

00:06:26.515 --> 00:06:27.516
(all gasp)

00:06:27.516 --> 00:06:29.518
-Well, we tried.
-I'm burning up.

00:06:30.853 --> 00:06:32.396
That Digimon...

00:06:32.437 --> 00:06:34.690
There must be some correlation,

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:38.026
between heat, and
the energy he has.

00:06:38.026 --> 00:06:39.194
All the Network Energy

00:06:39.236 --> 00:06:41.905
used by Tokyo's disaster
up to this point

00:06:41.947 --> 00:06:45.868
is now charging straight
into that Digimon!

00:06:47.286 --> 00:06:50.539
O-okay, so what exactly
does all that mean, Izzy?

00:06:50.581 --> 00:06:51.540
(both grunt)

00:06:51.582 --> 00:06:53.876
It means that big Digimon

00:06:53.917 --> 00:06:57.045
somehow managed to link
itself to our world.

00:06:57.045 --> 00:06:59.047
Linked itself?

00:06:59.047 --> 00:07:02.301
Which mean when the
countdown reaches zero

00:07:03.719 --> 00:07:06.763
that Digimon's energy will
be released all at once!

00:07:06.805 --> 00:07:10.058
And if that happens,
Tokyo will be annihilated!

00:07:11.602 --> 00:07:13.729
(grunts)

00:07:13.729 --> 00:07:14.730
Well then, Matt.

00:07:15.731 --> 00:07:17.232
Agumon.

00:07:17.274 --> 00:07:18.775
Alright.

00:07:18.817 --> 00:07:20.277
Let's do this.

00:07:20.319 --> 00:07:21.278
(groans weakly)

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:22.738
Whoa! You good?

00:07:22.779 --> 00:07:24.823
Don't worry, Tai, I'm fine.

00:07:27.576 --> 00:07:29.328
We have to stop him right here.

00:07:37.669 --> 00:07:40.005
(all grunt)

00:07:49.264 --> 00:07:51.516
(all gasp)

00:07:56.188 --> 00:07:58.607
(alarm blare continues)

00:07:58.649 --> 00:08:00.943
(panicked murmurs)

00:08:00.943 --> 00:08:03.612
(people scream)

00:08:08.992 --> 00:08:10.035
Kari! Kari!

00:08:22.506 --> 00:08:27.594
(energy whirs)

00:08:39.106 --> 00:08:41.358
(all groan)

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:43.568
Is everyone here still alive?

00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:45.654
Yeah, I think we're okay.

00:08:45.696 --> 00:08:48.657
So, those numbers
looking any better?

00:08:48.699 --> 00:08:50.575
Two minutes left.

00:08:50.617 --> 00:08:51.785
That's all we have.

00:08:52.786 --> 00:08:53.787
What can we do?

00:09:02.879 --> 00:09:05.132
(all gasp)

00:09:06.133 --> 00:09:08.343
Come on, we can stop it!

00:09:08.385 --> 00:09:10.178
Let's do this thing!

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:11.763
(both grunt)

00:09:11.805 --> 00:09:13.432
The others are counting on us.

00:09:13.473 --> 00:09:15.559
Yeah, we have to fight.

00:09:19.062 --> 00:09:20.272
Let's go!

00:09:20.314 --> 00:09:21.273
(all pant)

00:09:21.315 --> 00:09:22.274
On it!

00:09:22.316 --> 00:09:23.567
Gabumon!

00:09:23.608 --> 00:09:25.027
(growls)

00:09:25.068 --> 00:09:26.069
Agumon!

00:09:26.111 --> 00:09:28.363
(grunts)

00:09:28.405 --> 00:09:29.781
Ready, Tai?

00:09:29.823 --> 00:09:31.116
(Digivice beeps)

00:09:31.158 --> 00:09:32.117
Oh, yeah!

00:09:32.159 --> 00:09:34.911
(Digivice beeps)

00:09:37.581 --> 00:09:39.583
Agumon digivolve to...

00:09:41.001 --> 00:09:43.086
Gabumon digivolve to...

00:09:47.758 --> 00:09:48.759
Greymon!

00:09:49.926 --> 00:09:50.927
Garurumon!

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:56.683
(upscale action music)

00:09:57.642 --> 00:09:59.770
(grunts)

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:05.525
(grunts)

00:10:08.445 --> 00:10:09.946
Howling Blaster!

00:10:10.947 --> 00:10:12.032
Nova Blast!

00:10:27.881 --> 00:10:30.342
(all cry out)

00:10:37.307 --> 00:10:39.893
(ethereal hum)

00:11:01.248 --> 00:11:03.667
(all scream)

00:11:06.253 --> 00:11:08.255
(gasps)

00:11:12.259 --> 00:11:14.845
(ethereal hum)

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:31.278
(cape flaps)

00:11:36.283 --> 00:11:37.993
(all gasp)

00:11:38.034 --> 00:11:39.286
Whoa! No way!

00:11:48.295 --> 00:11:49.296
Omnimon!

00:12:07.647 --> 00:12:09.774
That's Omnimon.

00:12:09.816 --> 00:12:13.737
I remember! That's who stopped
the Tokyo Missile crises.

00:12:13.778 --> 00:12:14.946
[All] What?!

00:12:21.745 --> 00:12:25.665
You better act fast.
There's one minute left.

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:33.256
(dramatic action music)

00:12:39.846 --> 00:12:42.557
(energy whirs)

00:12:42.599 --> 00:12:45.644
Nidhoggmon's energy
level just keeps growing!

00:12:45.685 --> 00:12:47.103
Look over there!

00:12:47.145 --> 00:12:50.023
His power is
destroying everything!

00:12:53.818 --> 00:12:57.113
(upscale action music)

00:13:13.171 --> 00:13:15.173
(all gasp)

00:13:15.215 --> 00:13:17.759
No! Only forty seconds left!

00:13:17.801 --> 00:13:20.303
Come on, guys! You got this!

00:13:34.401 --> 00:13:36.403
(roars)

00:13:38.154 --> 00:13:40.240
(grunts)

00:13:56.756 --> 00:13:58.842
(grunts)

00:14:01.511 --> 00:14:04.180

(all gasp)

00:14:11.104 --> 00:14:12.105
It worked!

00:14:13.857 --> 00:14:15.317
Wait.

00:14:15.358 --> 00:14:20.071
I don't understand. Nidhoggmon's
energy level has increased?

00:14:21.531 --> 00:14:24.826
(energy whirs)

00:14:24.868 --> 00:14:26.870
And if this continues...

00:14:29.205 --> 00:14:31.625
(ice cracks)

00:14:34.377 --> 00:14:36.588
(all gasp)

00:14:39.966 --> 00:14:42.636
(ominous music)

00:14:43.553 --> 00:14:46.139
(energy whirs)

00:14:47.307 --> 00:14:49.559
(all gasp)

00:14:53.229 --> 00:14:54.773
That's it!

00:14:54.814 --> 00:14:56.483
He's been storing
up that energy,

00:14:56.524 --> 00:14:57.692
to release one big burst.

00:14:57.734 --> 00:14:59.527
Oh, good for him.

00:14:59.569 --> 00:15:00.570
Wait, what?!

00:15:14.751 --> 00:15:17.003
(all gasp)

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:25.804
(grunts)

00:15:33.812 --> 00:15:36.523
(Digivices whir)

00:15:40.318 --> 00:15:42.737
(all grunt)

00:15:42.779 --> 00:15:44.781
(gasps)

00:15:53.039 --> 00:15:55.542
(both scream)

00:16:04.384 --> 00:16:07.178
(all battle cry)

00:16:10.557 --> 00:16:12.809
(all gasp)

00:16:19.816 --> 00:16:21.818
(roars)

00:16:23.695 --> 00:16:25.905
(all gasp)

00:16:33.413 --> 00:16:35.999
(alarm ceases)

00:16:37.667 --> 00:16:38.793
(gasps)

00:16:38.835 --> 00:16:40.503
What happened?

00:16:40.545 --> 00:16:43.214
(crowd murmurs)

00:16:46.509 --> 00:16:48.011
[Man] The countdown stopped.

00:16:49.387 --> 00:16:51.639
My phone's isn't hot anymore.

00:16:51.681 --> 00:16:54.476
But what in the
world was all that?

00:17:03.401 --> 00:17:04.444
(upbeat music)

00:17:04.486 --> 00:17:06.237
[Yuuko] Kari! Kari!

00:17:09.991 --> 00:17:11.117
Kari!

00:17:11.159 --> 00:17:12.285
Mom.

00:17:12.327 --> 00:17:13.453
Thank goodness!

00:17:13.495 --> 00:17:15.872
(Yuuko sobs)

00:17:18.166 --> 00:17:20.752
(ethereal hum)

00:17:33.431 --> 00:17:36.643
Hey, mom? You don't
need to worry about Tai.

00:17:36.684 --> 00:17:37.685
Huh?

00:17:38.853 --> 00:17:41.648
He's gonna be fine,
I just know it!

00:17:41.689 --> 00:17:43.900
(chuckles)

00:17:46.861 --> 00:17:50.698
Tokyo's countdown has also
stopped! We did it, you guys!

00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:52.158
[All] Huh?

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:53.409
We're saved!

00:17:53.451 --> 00:17:55.203
You hear that Gomamon?

00:17:55.245 --> 00:17:57.914
(joyous laughs)

00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:01.918
[Izzy] Now that
I think about it,

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:04.212
exactly who is this Omnimon?

00:18:15.765 --> 00:18:17.934
(crashes)

00:18:20.937 --> 00:18:23.231
(all gasp)

00:18:25.233 --> 00:18:27.443
(all gasp)

00:18:39.455 --> 00:18:41.958
(heart beats)

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.294
(alarm blares)

00:18:44.335 --> 00:18:45.962
Huh?!

00:18:46.004 --> 00:18:47.547
No way!

00:18:47.589 --> 00:18:49.048
What's wrong, Izzy?

00:18:49.090 --> 00:18:51.384
Our countdown, it just...

00:18:51.426 --> 00:18:53.887
(countdown beeps)

00:18:53.928 --> 00:18:54.929
It hit zero!

00:18:56.848 --> 00:18:58.308
(ominous music)

00:18:58.349 --> 00:19:00.602
(all gasp)

00:19:02.687 --> 00:19:05.189
(all whimper)

00:19:06.774 --> 00:19:07.734
Biyomon!

00:19:07.775 --> 00:19:09.068
Sora!

00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:10.069
(all scream)

00:19:10.111 --> 00:19:11.404
[Joe] Gomamon!

00:19:11.446 --> 00:19:13.072
[Mimi] Palmon!

00:19:13.114 --> 00:19:15.325
(screams)

00:19:15.366 --> 00:19:16.826
Tentomon!

00:19:16.868 --> 00:19:18.369
I wanna go home!

00:19:21.039 --> 00:19:22.415
(grunts)

00:19:22.457 --> 00:19:23.458
Oh, no, you guys!

00:19:25.168 --> 00:19:27.629
(wind howls)

00:19:32.342 --> 00:19:34.844
(heart beats)

00:19:40.058 --> 00:19:42.560
(heart beats)

00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:49.734
(groans)

00:19:50.735 --> 00:19:51.778
What happened?

00:19:51.819 --> 00:19:52.820
What was that?

00:19:53.571 --> 00:19:55.031
(groans)

00:19:55.073 --> 00:19:57.533
I guess this means
everyone else is gone.

00:19:57.575 --> 00:19:58.534
Agumon!

00:19:58.576 --> 00:19:59.577
[Matt] You okay?

00:20:00.662 --> 00:20:01.871
You guys are here, too?

00:20:03.498 --> 00:20:06.459
When the fake Tokyo
started disappearing,

00:20:06.501 --> 00:20:09.379
it was odd, I felt
a strange presence.

00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:10.546
What do you mean?

00:20:12.548 --> 00:20:13.675
(all gasp)

00:20:13.716 --> 00:20:14.801
Now what's happening?

00:20:14.842 --> 00:20:16.052
(wind howls)

00:20:16.094 --> 00:20:17.887
(ominous music)

00:20:17.929 --> 00:20:20.014
(grunts)

00:20:21.432 --> 00:20:24.394
[Devimon] Your human world
is nothing but fodder.

00:20:24.435 --> 00:20:28.147
The fabricated city may
have turned to ashes,

00:20:28.189 --> 00:20:30.900
but the connection
between our worlds is fate

00:20:30.942 --> 00:20:33.236
and cannot be altered.

00:20:33.277 --> 00:20:34.487
Hey, you!

00:20:34.529 --> 00:20:36.864
Were you the one behind
this knockoff Tokyo?

00:20:38.241 --> 00:20:40.910
And that messed-up
stuff in our world?

00:20:40.952 --> 00:20:44.539
Light exists only to be
swallowed by darkness.

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:47.000
Resistance equals death.

00:20:47.041 --> 00:20:49.210
Where's the Celestial
Digimon?! Answer me!

00:20:50.712 --> 00:20:52.964
(all yell)

00:20:54.966 --> 00:20:57.427
(both grunt)

00:21:06.394 --> 00:21:08.646
(all gasp)

00:21:09.814 --> 00:21:12.275
(foreboding music)

00:21:12.316 --> 00:21:14.694
I have a feeling before
all of this is over,

00:21:14.736 --> 00:21:16.612
we'll be seeing him again.

00:21:16.654 --> 00:21:19.282
(frustrated grunts)

00:21:19.323 --> 00:21:20.324
At this rate,

00:21:20.366 --> 00:21:22.618
I guess we can expect
something to happen again

00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:23.911
in our world.

00:21:23.953 --> 00:21:26.622
Yeah and we have to find
the others before it does.

00:21:28.124 --> 00:21:31.127
(determined grunts)

00:21:40.386 --> 00:21:41.345

[Izzy] Next up on the Digimon
Encyclopedia is Togemon!

00:22:44.659 --> 00:22:46.619
This Digimon evolves from Palmon

00:22:46.661 --> 00:22:48.830
and has a Needle Spray
move that shoots prickly,

00:22:48.871 --> 00:22:50.581
hard needles, just like bullets!

00:22:52.708 --> 00:22:54.627
Now, let's check this out!

00:22:54.669 --> 00:22:57.880
I noticed that Togemon's eyes
and mouth look like Haniwa!

00:22:57.922 --> 00:23:00.466
I always worry if any
sand builds up inside.

00:23:00.508 --> 00:23:02.385
Actually, I'll have
to check that out!

00:23:05.596 --> 00:23:08.558
Which Digimon will
it be next time?

00:23:11.269 --> 00:23:14.564
[Narrator] Tai and Matt sneak
into the enormous Bulbmon.

00:23:14.605 --> 00:23:17.066
What hidden truth
awaits them inside?

00:23:17.108 --> 00:23:19.193
[Tai] Next time on
Digimon Adventure:

00:23:19.235 --> 00:23:20.987
"Fist of the Beast King!"

00:23:21.028 --> 00:23:23.698
[Narrator] The adventure
continues to a new world.
