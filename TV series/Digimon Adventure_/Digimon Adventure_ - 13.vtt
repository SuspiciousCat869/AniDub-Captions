00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:15.523
Biyomon!

00:00:15.556 --> 00:00:17.759
This Digimon is Sora's partner.

00:00:17.792 --> 00:00:20.061
Biyomon's flying
wasn't always so good,

00:00:20.094 --> 00:00:21.763
but it's getting
better all the time,

00:00:21.796 --> 00:00:23.531
thanks to Sora.

00:00:23.564 --> 00:00:24.866
Now, check this out!

00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:27.702
Biyomon is a very
curious Digimon.

00:00:27.735 --> 00:00:28.703
So curious, in fact,

00:00:28.736 --> 00:00:30.872
that it's got this habit
of pecking at anything

00:00:30.905 --> 00:00:32.707
that looks interesting.

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.042
Sounds a little painful.

00:00:35.076 --> 00:00:37.945
(intense music)

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:40.448
Which Digimon will
it be next time?

[Narrator] Hoping to find
the Celestial Digimon,

00:02:13.875 --> 00:02:15.977
the children split
up into two teams

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.578
and continued on their journey.

00:02:18.846 --> 00:02:19.981
Along the way,

00:02:20.014 --> 00:02:23.651
Tai and his team came across
some abandoned, old ruins

00:02:23.684 --> 00:02:25.319
which turned out
to be the remains

00:02:25.353 --> 00:02:27.188
of an ancient weapons factory.

00:02:27.221 --> 00:02:31.993
-(soft music)
-(ground rumbling)

00:02:32.026 --> 00:02:34.896
Mimi and Palmon got
separated from the team

00:02:34.929 --> 00:02:37.031
and were attacked by Andromon,

00:02:37.064 --> 00:02:38.566
an Ultimate Digimon

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:41.669
who'd been forced against
his will to be violent.

00:02:41.702 --> 00:02:43.704
They were saved by Guardromon,

00:02:43.738 --> 00:02:45.406
who'd awaken from a scrap pile,

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:47.575
where he'd been lying dormant.

00:02:47.608 --> 00:02:50.411
(soft music)

00:02:50.444 --> 00:02:51.445
But eventually,

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:54.582
as a result of Andromon's
relentless attacks,

00:02:54.615 --> 00:02:56.384
Guardromon fell in battle,

00:02:56.417 --> 00:02:57.919
trying to protect Mimi.

00:02:57.952 --> 00:03:00.254
-(soft music)
-(ground rumbling)

00:03:00.288 --> 00:03:01.689
And at that moment,

00:03:01.722 --> 00:03:03.724
Mimi's anger exploded.

00:03:05.393 --> 00:03:09.931
Togemon digivolved into the
Ultimate Digimon, Lillymon.

00:03:09.964 --> 00:03:12.867
And with a series of
swift and elegant attacks,

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.070
finally succeeded in
defeating Andromon.

00:03:16.103 --> 00:03:18.372
(soft music)

00:03:18.406 --> 00:03:21.375
After a victory
darkened by sorrow,

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:23.911
Tai's team left the ruins behind

00:03:23.945 --> 00:03:26.647
and continued on with
renewed determination.

00:03:28.783 --> 00:03:30.251
Meanwhile...

00:03:30.284 --> 00:03:33.254
(insects chirping)

00:03:34.956 --> 00:03:37.491
(wind howling)

00:03:45.933 --> 00:03:48.603
It's all jungle as
far as I can see.

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:51.572
You see anything?

00:03:51.606 --> 00:03:53.608
No, everything looks clear.

00:03:53.641 --> 00:03:54.742
(Joe sighs)

00:03:54.775 --> 00:03:55.743
(Joe retches)

00:03:55.776 --> 00:03:57.578
Joe, what's going on with you?

00:03:57.612 --> 00:03:58.980
Is something wrong?

00:03:59.013 --> 00:04:01.616
I don't know if it's
because of this long trip

00:04:01.649 --> 00:04:05.453
but I think that maybe I'm
beginning to get air sick.

00:04:05.486 --> 00:04:06.654
(Joe retches)

00:04:06.687 --> 00:04:08.923
Well, you are the
sensitive type.

00:04:08.956 --> 00:04:10.157
Don't worry about it.

00:04:10.191 --> 00:04:12.593
No need to push yourself
beyond your limit.

00:04:12.627 --> 00:04:13.761
(Joe retches)

00:04:13.794 --> 00:04:17.298
Sorry, I think I'm
already beyond my limit.

00:04:17.331 --> 00:04:18.299
(Joe retches)

00:04:18.332 --> 00:04:19.467
Hey, Birdramon!

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.102
Better land, quick!

00:04:21.135 --> 00:04:22.103
We need a break.

00:04:22.136 --> 00:04:23.671
Got it.

00:04:23.704 --> 00:04:25.606
(wind swooshing)

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:26.607
Hey, wait.

00:04:26.641 --> 00:04:27.608
(Sora and Gabumon exclaims)

00:04:27.642 --> 00:04:29.176
Something's coming!

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.112
(wings buzzing)

00:04:31.145 --> 00:04:32.113
(Gabumon grunts)

00:04:32.146 --> 00:04:34.448
[Gabumon] Those are Fanbeemon.

00:04:34.482 --> 00:04:36.684
Do you think they're
coming for us?

00:04:36.717 --> 00:04:38.352
No, I don't think so.

00:04:38.386 --> 00:04:39.620
(tense music)

00:04:39.654 --> 00:04:41.288
It looks more like
they're being chased.

00:04:41.322 --> 00:04:43.724
(tense music)

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:49.664
-(tense music)
-(web swooshing)

00:04:50.564 --> 00:04:53.300

-(tense music)
-(electric crackling)

00:05:27.935 --> 00:05:29.904
Ah, do you think...

00:05:29.937 --> 00:05:31.739
That thing...

00:05:31.772 --> 00:05:35.009
It couldn't possibly
be a Digimon as well,

00:05:35.042 --> 00:05:36.343
could it?

00:05:36.377 --> 00:05:38.579
[Joe] Yeah, I think it is.

00:05:38.612 --> 00:05:40.014
[Gomamon] If it is,

00:05:40.047 --> 00:05:41.615
it sure is a big one.

00:05:42.783 --> 00:05:44.752
[Matt] I've never seen
something like that.

00:05:44.785 --> 00:05:46.554
Do you think it's
an Ultimate Digimon?

00:05:46.587 --> 00:05:48.255
[Gabumon] Yeah, probably.

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:49.523
(Joe retches)

00:05:49.557 --> 00:05:52.526

The Fanbeemon!

00:05:56.263 --> 00:05:57.932
Oh, those poor things.

00:05:57.965 --> 00:05:59.100
Birdramon!

00:05:59.133 --> 00:06:00.101
I'm on it.

00:06:00.134 --> 00:06:01.702
(Birdramon swooshing)

00:06:01.736 --> 00:06:04.605

[Sora] Birdramon,
into the forest!

[Birdramon] Roger that!

Joe overboard!

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:53.587
Joe!

00:06:53.621 --> 00:06:54.588
-(Sora gasps)
-Wait!

00:06:54.622 --> 00:06:55.823
I'm finished!

00:06:55.856 --> 00:06:58.125
Goodbye cruel world!

00:06:58.159 --> 00:07:00.427
(Joe screams)

(Waspmon swooshing)

00:07:28.355 --> 00:07:31.358
[Sora] Any sign
of Joe or Gomamon?

00:07:31.392 --> 00:07:32.626
(Gabumon groans)

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:35.029
They should have fallen
around here somewhere.

00:07:35.062 --> 00:07:36.463
Well, Gomamon's with him

00:07:36.497 --> 00:07:38.532
so I'm sure they'll
both be alright.

00:07:38.566 --> 00:07:40.167
-(leaves rustling)

Hey, don't worry.

00:08:10.231 --> 00:08:11.899
We're not gonna catch
you or anything.

00:08:11.932 --> 00:08:13.167

-(Cannonbeemon swooshing)

00:08:24.445 --> 00:08:25.679
So, Fanbeemon,

00:08:25.713 --> 00:08:28.249
what in the world is
going on here anyway?

00:08:30.217 --> 00:08:32.753
Fanbeemon and
everyone being forced

00:08:32.786 --> 00:08:35.089
to turn into soldiers
for Cannonbeemon.

00:08:35.122 --> 00:08:36.090
(Sora and Biyomon gasps)

00:08:36.123 --> 00:08:37.458
Get taken away.

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:40.094
Cannonbeemon.

00:08:40.127 --> 00:08:42.062
I take it Cannonbeemon
is the name

00:08:42.096 --> 00:08:44.031
of that giant one
floating in the sky?

00:08:44.064 --> 00:08:45.599
Now...

00:08:45.633 --> 00:08:47.101
Now everyone captured,

00:08:47.134 --> 00:08:48.936
except for me!

00:08:48.969 --> 00:08:52.539
-(Fanbeemon cries)
-(Sora and Biyomon exclaims)

00:08:52.573 --> 00:08:54.942
Say, Matt, did you
happen to notice

00:08:54.975 --> 00:08:57.578
the dark miasma those
guys were emitting?

00:08:57.611 --> 00:08:59.079
Yeah, you're right.

00:08:59.113 --> 00:09:02.082
So, that must be how they're
building their forces up.

00:09:02.116 --> 00:09:03.117
This is bad.

00:09:05.252 --> 00:09:06.253
That's awful.

00:09:07.121 --> 00:09:08.455
[Joe] Help!

00:09:08.489 --> 00:09:10.758
-Somebody please help me!
-(Sora gasps)

00:09:10.791 --> 00:09:12.092
-Huh?
-Huh?

00:09:12.126 --> 00:09:13.093
Did you hear that?

00:09:13.127 --> 00:09:15.296
[Joe] Get me out of here!

00:09:15.329 --> 00:09:17.831
(tense music)

00:09:19.099 --> 00:09:20.968
(Joe and Gomamon groans)

00:09:21.001 --> 00:09:22.903
I'm so not enjoying this.

00:09:22.937 --> 00:09:23.971
Hang on, Joe.

00:09:24.004 --> 00:09:25.406
Stay calm.

00:09:25.439 --> 00:09:26.740
Hurry up, Gomamon.

00:09:26.774 --> 00:09:28.309
Digivolve to...

00:09:28.342 --> 00:09:29.310
(Joe retches)

00:09:29.343 --> 00:09:30.577
Actually, nevermind.

00:09:30.611 --> 00:09:31.578
(Gomamon groans)

00:09:31.612 --> 00:09:34.982
(Joe and Gomamon screams)

00:09:35.015 --> 00:09:37.518
(tense music)

00:09:41.021 --> 00:09:42.022
What do you see?

00:09:42.056 --> 00:09:45.092
Joe and Gomamon got taken
inside Cannonbeemon.

00:09:45.125 --> 00:09:46.927
Oh man, what a bummer.

00:09:46.961 --> 00:09:48.595
We've gotta save them quick.

00:09:48.629 --> 00:09:50.297
-Biyomon!
-Mm.

00:09:50.331 --> 00:09:51.332
Hold on.

00:09:52.967 --> 00:09:54.034
I have an idea.

00:09:59.723 --> 00:10:02.017
(feet thudding)

00:10:04.395 --> 00:10:05.562
Whoa!

00:10:05.596 --> 00:10:06.697
Hey, Izzy!

00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:08.098
I need a little help here.

00:10:08.132 --> 00:10:09.933
What do you think
that is up ahead?

00:10:09.967 --> 00:10:10.934
-Hm?
-Hm?

00:10:10.968 --> 00:10:11.935
Well actually,

00:10:11.969 --> 00:10:13.437
I've been having some trouble

00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:16.440
getting a good connection
on my tablet recently.

00:10:16.473 --> 00:10:18.042
Really? Again?

00:10:18.075 --> 00:10:19.943
Gee, doesn't it seem
like you've been having

00:10:19.977 --> 00:10:21.945
that problem with
it a lot lately?

00:10:21.979 --> 00:10:23.781
It's probably just broken.

00:10:23.814 --> 00:10:25.049
No, that's not it.

00:10:25.082 --> 00:10:26.784
The tablet works fine.

00:10:26.817 --> 00:10:27.951
Don't you worry.

00:10:27.985 --> 00:10:29.386
If I ask my grandpa,

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:31.588
I can get you our company's
very latest model,

00:10:31.622 --> 00:10:33.090
right off the shelf.

00:10:33.123 --> 00:10:35.893
Maybe it'll work if we give
it a little karate chop?

00:10:35.926 --> 00:10:37.461
Is this where I come in?

00:10:37.494 --> 00:10:38.696
Ugh.

00:10:38.729 --> 00:10:42.232
Izzy, perhaps you just need
to find a different location.

00:10:42.266 --> 00:10:44.234
Uh, one with better reception.

00:10:44.268 --> 00:10:45.469
Good idea.

00:10:45.502 --> 00:10:47.438
Maybe then we can
get it to work.

00:10:47.471 --> 00:10:49.807
Okay. Well then I
say we keep climbing

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:51.742
until we get to a
better spot higher up.

00:10:51.775 --> 00:10:52.743
Yeah.

00:10:52.776 --> 00:10:54.144
(Izzy grunts)

00:10:54.178 --> 00:10:56.947
(device ticking)

00:10:57.981 --> 00:10:58.949

(Fanbeemon grunts)

00:11:10.627 --> 00:11:12.629
I come to help you all escape.

00:11:12.663 --> 00:11:13.630
Hurry!

00:11:13.664 --> 00:11:15.265
(wings buzzing)

00:11:15.299 --> 00:11:18.435
(Digimon roaring)

00:11:18.469 --> 00:11:19.970
Now's your chance to
escape, Fanbeemon.

00:11:20.804 --> 00:11:21.972
Get moving.

00:11:22.005 --> 00:11:23.507
Thank you, Sora.

00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:25.609
(wings buzzing)

00:11:25.642 --> 00:11:27.511
(laser swooshing)

00:11:27.544 --> 00:11:29.847
(Gabumon groans)

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:32.649
(Biyomon whines)

00:11:35.352 --> 00:11:36.320
Here it comes.

00:11:36.353 --> 00:11:37.955
Remember, don't resist.

00:11:37.988 --> 00:11:39.523
Yeah, I've got it.

00:11:39.556 --> 00:11:44.561
-(tense music)
-(web swooshing)

00:11:45.829 --> 00:11:48.699
(mystical music)

(Waspmon swooshing)

00:11:58.041 --> 00:11:59.376
[Gomamon] Joe!

00:12:00.677 --> 00:12:02.880
Ugh, where are you Joe?

00:12:02.913 --> 00:12:05.649
(garbage clanging)

00:12:05.682 --> 00:12:08.485
-(garbage rumbling)
-(Joe screams)

00:12:08.519 --> 00:12:09.486
(Joe whimpers)

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:11.054
I'm so cold.

00:12:11.088 --> 00:12:14.158
Hey, come warm me up, Gomamon!

00:12:14.191 --> 00:12:17.194
(Waspmon swooshing)

00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:23.000

(ground rumbling)

00:13:23.427 --> 00:13:25.262
What's that sound?

00:13:25.295 --> 00:13:27.965
Now, what? Just when I thought
it couldn't get any worse,

00:13:27.998 --> 00:13:29.233
it suddenly did.

00:13:29.266 --> 00:13:31.735
(laser swooshing)

00:13:31.768 --> 00:13:33.670
[Matt] Come on,
let's wipe them out!

00:13:34.972 --> 00:13:36.406

Huh?

00:14:26.056 --> 00:14:28.358
Matt, Sora, you made it.

00:14:28.392 --> 00:14:29.493
You gotta move, Joe.

00:14:29.526 --> 00:14:30.527
Get outta the way, quick!

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:31.528
Huh?

(wall rumbling)

00:14:37.334 --> 00:14:39.036
What is this place?

00:14:39.069 --> 00:14:40.037
A garbage dump?

00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:41.038
What?

00:14:41.071 --> 00:14:43.140
I am not garbage!

I'm glad to see you, Joe!

00:14:54.351 --> 00:14:56.395
You guys, I could
really use your help.

00:15:06.305 --> 00:15:08.106
They captured so many.

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:09.608

(laser swooshing)

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:16.715
They're coming from both sides.

00:15:16.748 --> 00:15:18.383
We're totally surrounded.

00:15:18.417 --> 00:15:20.886

00:15:31.596 --> 00:15:33.899
Okay, Biyomon, you
know what to do!

00:15:33.932 --> 00:15:35.600
Leave it to me.

00:15:35.634 --> 00:15:36.601
(tense music)

Sora?

00:16:14.539 --> 00:16:17.175
Sorry, I've gotta go
free those prisoners.

00:16:17.209 --> 00:16:18.677
I knew you'd say that.

00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:20.379
But, but how?

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:24.683
I remembered what happened
with Neamon, that's how.

00:16:24.716 --> 00:16:26.318
It was obvious.

00:16:26.351 --> 00:16:27.786
I knew there was no way

00:16:27.819 --> 00:16:30.856
you would just leave
those Fanbeemon behind.

00:16:30.889 --> 00:16:32.124
(Sora exclaims)

00:16:32.157 --> 00:16:33.625
(Sora grins)

00:16:33.658 --> 00:16:36.161
(tense music)

00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:39.731
Harpoon Torpedo!

00:16:41.666 --> 00:16:44.369
(missile rumbling)

00:16:44.403 --> 00:16:46.171
(missile swooshing)

00:16:46.204 --> 00:16:47.806
We've got your back guys.

00:16:47.839 --> 00:16:49.474
Leave all those Waspmon to us.

00:16:49.508 --> 00:16:50.809
We'll take care of them.

00:16:50.842 --> 00:16:52.210
It's Joe and Ikkakumon.

00:16:52.244 --> 00:16:53.311
They've come to help.

00:16:53.345 --> 00:16:54.513
There's a lot of them.

00:16:54.546 --> 00:16:56.214
Do you have a plan?

00:16:56.248 --> 00:16:57.983
Yeah, we'll get
back inside again,

00:16:58.016 --> 00:16:59.351
round up the Fanbeemon,

00:16:59.384 --> 00:17:01.186
and get them all
in one location.

00:17:01.219 --> 00:17:03.655
[Birdramon] Right, and then
I'll carry them to safety.

00:17:03.688 --> 00:17:05.490
(intense music)

00:17:05.524 --> 00:17:06.525
[Matt] Got it.

00:17:09.027 --> 00:17:10.362
So, we go back in.

00:17:10.395 --> 00:17:11.830
(intense music)

00:17:11.863 --> 00:17:15.400
(missile swooshing)

00:17:15.434 --> 00:17:17.736
[Birdramon] Meteor Wing!

00:17:17.769 --> 00:17:20.772
(missile rumbling)

00:17:21.706 --> 00:17:22.874
[Matt] Give me three minutes.

00:17:22.908 --> 00:17:25.577
(intense music)

00:17:36.455 --> 00:17:40.025
-(laser swooshing)
-(missile rumbling)

00:17:40.058 --> 00:17:43.428
(WereGarurumon roars)

00:17:43.462 --> 00:17:44.930
(glass shattering)

00:17:44.963 --> 00:17:47.599
(wings buzzing)

00:17:47.632 --> 00:17:48.600
Come on, everybody!

00:17:48.633 --> 00:17:49.601
Hurry up!

00:17:49.634 --> 00:17:52.270
(intense music)

00:17:54.906 --> 00:17:57.242
(wall rumbling)

00:17:57.275 --> 00:17:59.311
[Birdramon] Sora, look.

00:18:03.482 --> 00:18:04.716
That's our cue.

00:18:04.749 --> 00:18:06.785
Looks like it's go
time, Birdramon.

00:18:06.818 --> 00:18:07.919
You got it.

00:18:09.087 --> 00:18:11.556
-(intense music)
-(mechanical music)

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:14.826
(electricity whirring)

00:18:19.998 --> 00:18:21.733
(laser swooshing)

00:18:21.766 --> 00:18:24.469
(Birdramon groans)

00:18:24.503 --> 00:18:27.506
(mountain rumbling)

00:18:31.109 --> 00:18:32.577
(Sora gasps)

00:18:32.611 --> 00:18:35.447
(Sora groans)

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:37.082

-(laser swooshing)
-(ground rumbling)

00:18:49.861 --> 00:18:50.829
[Sora] Joe...

00:18:50.862 --> 00:18:51.863
He did it.

00:18:52.964 --> 00:18:55.133
He and Matt opened
up a path for us.

00:18:57.802 --> 00:18:59.271
And I promise,

00:18:59.304 --> 00:19:00.805
I am gonna get through it.

00:19:01.473 --> 00:19:03.341
Not just for our world,

00:19:03.375 --> 00:19:05.877
but for the suffering
Digimon in this world, too.

00:19:07.479 --> 00:19:12.117
I will save you all!

00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:14.319
(magical music)

00:19:14.352 --> 00:19:17.122
(intense music)

00:19:17.155 --> 00:19:18.790
[Birdramon] Birdramon!

00:19:18.823 --> 00:19:20.125
Digivolve to...

00:19:20.158 --> 00:19:22.827
(intense music)

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:29.501

(singing in Japanese)

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:39.678
An Ultimate.

00:19:40.845 --> 00:19:42.213
Garudamon!

00:19:42.247 --> 00:19:44.015
(Garudamon roars)

00:19:44.049 --> 00:19:45.817
(Garudamon grunts)

00:19:45.850 --> 00:19:48.987
(Garudamon grunts)

00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:50.221
(laser swooshing)

00:19:50.255 --> 00:19:54.326
(singing in Japanese)

00:19:54.359 --> 00:19:55.827

00:19:58.597 --> 00:20:03.034
(singing in Japanese)

00:20:03.935 --> 00:20:05.503
(Cannonbeemon rumbling)

00:20:05.537 --> 00:20:06.504
Sora?

00:20:06.538 --> 00:20:07.505
[Sora] Let's do it.

00:20:07.539 --> 00:20:11.109
(Sora and Garudamon yells)

00:20:12.444 --> 00:20:13.712
(Cannonbeemon rumbling)

00:20:13.745 --> 00:20:15.880
(singing in Japanese)

(Cannonbeemon rumbling)

00:20:19.918 --> 00:20:21.386
(Garudamon grunts)

00:20:21.419 --> 00:20:23.588
(Garudamon screams)

00:20:23.622 --> 00:20:25.924
(singing in Japanese)

00:20:25.957 --> 00:20:29.294
(Cannonbeemon rumbling)

00:20:29.894 --> 00:20:32.864
Man, Sora, you are awesome!

00:20:32.897 --> 00:20:36.234
(Cannonbeemon rumbling)

00:20:38.403 --> 00:20:40.705
(Cannonbeemon exploding)

00:20:40.739 --> 00:20:43.308
(intense music)

00:20:49.581 --> 00:20:50.782
Thank you, Sora!

00:20:50.815 --> 00:20:51.883
For everything.

00:20:51.916 --> 00:20:53.118
-So long everybody!
-(Sora laughs) Take care!

00:20:53.151 --> 00:20:55.153
Take care of yourselves!

00:20:56.254 --> 00:20:57.555
Garudamon.

00:20:57.589 --> 00:20:59.290
Pretty amazing, huh?

00:20:59.324 --> 00:21:00.325
Sure was.

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:03.962
But, it just goes to show

00:21:03.995 --> 00:21:07.098
the kind of power we're
gonna need moving forward.

00:21:07.132 --> 00:21:08.600
If we're gonna have a chance.

00:21:12.971 --> 00:21:15.440
[Izzy] Hey, it's working again.

00:21:15.473 --> 00:21:16.975
See, what'd I tell ya?

00:21:17.008 --> 00:21:17.976
Am I right?

00:21:18.009 --> 00:21:19.144
Or am I right?

00:21:19.177 --> 00:21:20.445
That's the good news.

00:21:20.478 --> 00:21:22.614
The bad news is our
rendezvous point with Matt

00:21:22.647 --> 00:21:25.283
is still a long ways away.

00:21:25.316 --> 00:21:27.786
It's past the next canyon.

00:21:27.819 --> 00:21:28.953
Oh hey, Izzy.

00:21:28.987 --> 00:21:30.922
Are you able to find out
what's happening on our world

00:21:30.955 --> 00:21:32.757
now that you've got
a connection again?

00:21:32.791 --> 00:21:33.758
[Izzy] Let's see.

00:21:33.792 --> 00:21:35.427
The situation in Tokyo is...

00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:36.594
(device ticking)

00:21:36.628 --> 00:21:38.663
Ugh, not again.

00:21:38.697 --> 00:21:39.664
Like I told you,

00:21:39.698 --> 00:21:40.665
with things like that,

00:21:40.699 --> 00:21:42.300
the one sure way
to get him to work

00:21:42.333 --> 00:21:44.102
is give him a good whack.

00:21:44.135 --> 00:21:45.103
Come on, let me give it a try.

00:21:45.136 --> 00:21:46.604
I don't think so,

00:21:46.638 --> 00:21:47.639
but thanks.

00:21:47.672 --> 00:21:50.141
I'm telling you, my
grandpa will hook you up.

00:21:50.175 --> 00:21:51.276
-Whoo!
-Watch out.

00:21:51.309 --> 00:21:52.777
You might hurt your hand.

00:21:52.811 --> 00:21:54.813
Why don't you just
let me whack it?

00:21:54.846 --> 00:21:56.314
(Tai laughs)

00:21:56.347 --> 00:21:57.816
I was only joking, Agumon.

00:21:57.849 --> 00:22:00.285
But anyway, we better
get a move on.

00:22:00.318 --> 00:22:03.288
Hm, ready when you are, Tai.

00:22:03.321 --> 00:22:05.890
