00:12:39.131 --> 00:12:41.901
You'll take another dark form.

00:12:41.934 --> 00:12:45.137
Or perhaps you'll
embody the light.

00:12:45.137 --> 00:12:46.806
Or neither.

00:12:46.806 --> 00:12:50.309
None should be bound
to any singular fate

00:12:50.309 --> 00:12:52.745

We just finished a real big job.

00:15:35.975 --> 00:15:37.910

Sheboygan is nice.

Now you have all the time
in the world for studying.

You're right, Gomamon.

It's time for the
real battle to begin.

You did great!

You too, Sora!

you in my heart.

Okay.

00:17:12.538 --> 00:17:14.540
So peace has come
to the Digital World

00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:16.976
and you're saying
it's 'cause of humans?

00:17:17.009 --> 00:17:18.210
[Wisemon] To be precise,

00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:20.379
it is the children
we have to thank,

00:17:20.379 --> 00:17:22.348
namely the Digi-Destined.

00:17:22.381 --> 00:17:25.050
And their faithful
Digimon partners.

00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:27.720
I'm pleased to pass on
the tale of their efforts.

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:30.723
After all, what's more
exciting than history?

00:17:30.723 --> 00:17:33.692

our heroes hail from.

00:17:43.736 --> 00:17:46.372
And they chose to come here

00:17:46.405 --> 00:17:48.741
so they could defend us.

00:17:48.741 --> 00:17:50.509
What they did was brave,

00:17:50.542 --> 00:17:53.512
but I also believe they
came here to be our friends.

00:17:53.545 --> 00:17:55.247
How do you know that though?

00:17:55.247 --> 00:17:56.248
I'll tell you.

00:17:57.249 --> 00:17:59.852
Those kids, they only
fought to protect

00:17:59.885 --> 00:18:01.053

00:18:10.763 --> 00:18:12.698
What manner of result shall come

00:18:12.731 --> 00:18:15.701
from the convergence of our
two different universes?

00:18:15.734 --> 00:18:17.369
The answer is
something that even

00:18:17.403 --> 00:18:19.571
I myself cannot predict.

00:18:19.605 --> 00:18:22.441
In any case, the more
the enigma grows,

00:18:22.441 --> 00:18:25.611
the more my thirst as a
researcher shall as well.

00:18:25.611 --> 00:18:27.880
Can you slow down for
the peanut gallery?

00:18:27.913 --> 00:18:28.881

00:18:28.914 --> 00:18:30.049

00:18:30.082 --> 00:18:31.050
Right.

One thing is for certain,

00:18:32.918 --> 00:18:36.955
for today's Digimon, a
new life has been born

00:18:36.955 --> 00:18:39.458
and our Digital
World shall continue

That was quite a story.

00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:47.493
So what happened to
the Digi-Destined

00:19:47.526 --> 00:19:48.827
after they won the battle?

00:19:49.695 --> 00:19:51.196
I wonder the same thing.

00:19:52.831 --> 00:19:54.366
It's tough to say.

00:19:54.366 --> 00:19:56.502
The answer's a bit of a mystery.

00:19:58.704 --> 00:20:01.140
We know they returned
to their world.

00:20:01.173 --> 00:20:04.042

may never find out.
