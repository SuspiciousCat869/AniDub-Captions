1
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:59,000
Good morning...
How you doing sunshine?

2
00:01:59,083 --> 00:02:00,666
We're almost out of
shampoo and conditioner

3
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,625
so I'll pick some up on
the way home from work.

4
00:02:02,708 --> 00:02:03,916
Same brand okay with you?

5
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,083
Yeah.

6
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,416
It's crazy how quickly
we go through stuff

7
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,833
when we're together...

8
00:02:09,916 --> 00:02:12,000
It seems like I'm going
to the store every other day.

9
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:13,041
Mhmm.

10
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:14,208
So what do you
think we should make

11
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:15,416
for dinner tonight...?

12
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,250
Is there anything you've
been craving lately?

13
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:18,916
Not really.

14
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:22,083
Well... I'll
figure something out

15
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:23,333
when I go to the store.

16
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:24,833
You know...

17
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:27,041
I think it's really fun planning
dinners together with you.

18
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:30,375
I'm just really happy with
the way things are going.

19
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:33,916
Takayuki!

20
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,083
What time do you
think you'll be home?

21
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:37,125
Uhh, ya' know the usual time.

22
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:39,875
Alright.

23
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:41,458
Call and let me know
if you gonna be late.

24
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:43,750
Will do.

25
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:45,666
Bye... See you tonight.

26
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:50,041
I'm sure you can't wait.

27
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:55,541
See you tomorrow.

28
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:00,500
What now?

29
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:01,666
Come with me.

30
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,208
Why? What's going...

31
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,958
Mayu and I are starting
to get nervous...

32
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:08,833
the manager has been acting
very strange around us lately.

33
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:10,250
The manager.

34
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:11,625
Yeah, he keeps
following us around

35
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:13,458
and asking if
we're doing our jobs.

36
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:14,541
It's creepy.

37
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:15,833
We were wondering if someone

38
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:17,750
as dense as you had
seen anything suspicious.

39
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:19,708
Wow you guys really
cracked this case open.,.

40
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:21,916
He's watching you two because
you never do your friggin' jobs.

41
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,041
Don't start with me!

42
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:25,583
Ayu wait!
We're still on the clock.

43
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:27,208
Save your death blow for later!

44
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:30,041
I'm wasting my time here. Adios

45
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:34,791
What is it now?

46
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:36,208
The way he glares
at the two of us

47
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:38,125
is different from how he
looks at the other employees.

48
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:39,083
How?

49
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:40,291
Oh, I've been going through

50
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:41,625
the possible scenarios lately.

51
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:43,375
I think there's something
sinister going on here

52
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:45,250
like he's thinking lurid
and disgusting thoughts

53
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:46,458
about us women.

54
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:48,166
What...? Could that be true...?

55
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,375
I hope he doesn't sell us
to some third world pimp

56
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:52,666
or make us clean
out the chicken fryer.

57
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,666
Just make sure you
get all the grease off.

58
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:57,708
Mayu quick...!

59
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:59,500
Let's take our chances
with the lunch crowd!

60
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:01,375
Wait for me!

61
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:04,000
What the hell
was that all about?

62
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:06,166
Oh, No idea.

63
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:23,583
Take your seats.

64
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,791
Next stop is
Keyaki General Hospital.

65
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:39,625
Please press the buzzer
if you wish to stop.

66
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:44,791
Keyaki.

67
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:49,875
See ya.

68
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:02,458
What's up Mr. Boyfriend?

69
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:03,541
Not much.

70
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:05,333
You haven't missed
a day in weeks.

71
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:07,083
Huh, you look like you're tired

72
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:08,958
or maybe getting
sick or something ...

73
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:10,791
Remember it's important
for our patient's state

74
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,625
of mind that you
not look depressed ...

75
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:15,125
If you look happy it
brings their spirits up.

76
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:17,666
M'kay... I don't
look that bad, do I?

77
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,125
I didn't mean it like that...

78
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:21,791
But if you have a problem
you can always talk to us...

79
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:24,958
I could really help
you--suck--it--up!

80
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:28,250
Sweetie do you know
how dirty that sounded?

81
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:30,208
That's not what I meant I swear!

82
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:31,916
I was just talking
about his emotions!

83
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,250
Oh right I'm so sure...
Classic Freudian slip.

84
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:36,791
You know what I meant to say.

85
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:38,666
Don't try to turn it around
and make me look like a pervert!

86
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:41,958
Takayuki please don't take
this the wrong way but...

87
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:45,375
There you go!

88
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:47,541
Now go on and show that big
smile to your girlfriend...

89
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:49,583
Because even if your
life is full of worries

90
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:52,083
a smile will make
everything seem brighter.

91
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:53,583
You'd be surprised
at how much quicker

92
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:56,625
some patients recover when
they have a positive attitude.

93
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,083
Takayuki you're so funny.

94
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:01,833
I'm serious though,

95
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:03,833
when they let you out of
here we have to go eat there.

96
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:05,708
The plates they serve
you are this big!

97
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:07,333
It's more food
than you can imagine.

98
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:10,625
I can't wait 'till
they let me out of here.

99
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:13,541
Whoa, it's later than
I thought it was...

100
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:16,250
I guess it's time for me
to start heading home.

101
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:20,041
I've got lots of studying
to do... See you tomorrow?

102
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:25,083
Aw, really. I was
hoping you'd stay longer.

103
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:26,166
Come on now.

104
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,208
But don't you like...

105
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:30,833
spending time
with me... Takayuki?

106
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:32,291
Of course I do Haruka...

107
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:34,750
If I could have my way I'd
stay with you all the time.

108
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:35,958
Really?

109
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:37,833
Yes, really...

110
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:39,541
When I'm spending
time with you talking

111
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:42,500
and having a good laugh
I can forget all of my troubles.

112
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:44,250
I feel at peace around you.

113
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:46,416
Wow.

114
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:51,458
That's very nice, of you to say.

115
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,625
Every moment that
I spend with you is

116
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:57,500
without a doubt the
happiest point of my day.

117
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,625
Thank you.

118
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:02,375
No, thank you.

119
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:04,166
You're welcome.

120
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:08,208
Well I don't want to
keep you from getting rest...

121
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:09,958
Soon enough you'll be out
of here and we'll all be able

122
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:12,583
to go out on the town
like we used to years ago.

123
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:17,083
Years ago...? Huh?

124
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:18,208
Whatever you do don't tell her

125
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:20,000
she's been under
for three years.

126
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:22,083
Her mind can't comprehend that.

127
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:26,333
For her, time stopped on
the day she was hit by that car.

128
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:29,958
Oh sorry. I don't
know what I'm saying.

129
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:32,833
I've just been so
busy studying lately...

130
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:34,458
and work is a madhouse.

131
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:37,291
These last few weeks
have just really flown by.

132
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:42,666
Haruka?

133
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:54,333
Takayuki.

134
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:01,958
I wish we could just
stay like this forever.

135
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,166
So I was at the
store today buying food,

136
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:24,125
and I completely forgot to buy
the shampoo and conditioner,

137
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:26,416
I hope that's okay with you.

138
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:32,791
So, your friend.

139
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:34,541
She looks pretty intimidating.

140
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:35,916
Huh...? What friend?

141
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,500
On the bus...
The lady sitting next to you.

142
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:39,833
Does she work with you?

143
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:42,791
Oh... That's Ms. Ishida...

144
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:45,250
She's actually a really cool
person once you get to know her.

145
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:46,375
I bet...

146
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:47,791
So you pretty busy
with work right now?

147
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:50,041
Not really...
It's been kinda slow.

148
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:58,375
Shall I pour for you dear?

149
00:08:58,791 --> 00:08:59,791
Why thank you.

150
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:07,708
By the way, I was wondering...

151
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:09,458
About Haruka.

152
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:10,708
Uh-huh.

153
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:11,958
How is she?

154
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:13,458
What do you mean?

155
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:16,208
Have there been any changes?

156
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:17,541
Not really.

157
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:18,958
She's pretty much the
same as when you saw her.

158
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:22,875
Oh.

159
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:25,166
I'm sure she'll be
better soon though.

160
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:48,875
Is that you, Takayuki?

161
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:54,000
It's Takayuki!

162
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:57,750
Mitsuki!

163
00:09:57,833 --> 00:09:59,333
I'm so glad you're
feeling better.

164
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:00,458
You look great.

165
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:02,208
Thanks.

166
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:03,375
Hang in there.

167
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:05,041
I'm sure you'll be
out of here in no time.

168
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:06,041
You must get bored having

169
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:07,291
to stay in this
bed all day long.

170
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:09,458
Takayuki and
Akane come visit me,

171
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:10,750
so it's not that bad...

172
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:12,333
That's nice.

173
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:14,833
Takayuki takes the time
to visit me every day,

174
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:16,791
even though he's busy studying.

175
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:17,958
Yeah?

176
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:21,666
He even sits with me
in bed... sometimes.

177
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:22,750
Great.

178
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:25,000
He is such a
sweetheart Mitsuki...

179
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:28,416
His funny stories from
work always make me laugh.

180
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,791
You know...

181
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:33,583
I think I've come to realize
something... that I'm...

182
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:38,291
I'm in love with him,
and it feels so amazing.

183
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:43,416
I'm home.

184
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:47,916
What's going on, baby...?

185
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,458
Is everything okay?

186
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:02,166
Takayuki.

187
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,916
Yeah, what's up?

188
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Promise that you
won't leave me okay...?

189
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:08,333
Promise me that we'll
be together forever.

190
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:09,541
What's going on...?

191
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:11,708
Did something happen today?

192
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:13,333
I'm afraid...

193
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:15,375
I'm afraid you'll leave
the apartment one morning

194
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:17,333
and never come back.

195
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:21,375
I just.. I saw Haruka today.

196
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:22,625
The look in her eyes along

197
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:24,791
with what she said
really scared me.

198
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:26,166
What?

199
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:30,583
Takayuki.

200
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:33,000
I don't want you
to visit her anymore.

201
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:34,875
Huh, why is that?

202
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:36,416
Well, why do you have to?

203
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,958
Look Haruka's parents asked me

204
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:39,875
to start visiting
her again okay...

205
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:41,041
They said it would
help her recover

206
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:42,625
so I said I would
do it for them.

207
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:45,000
And that's all?

208
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:47,083
What's that supposed to mean?

209
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:48,625
You spend more time with her

210
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,041
than you do with me,

211
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:52,000
all we ever do is
sleep together...

212
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:55,583
I thought it was,
over between you two.

213
00:11:55,666 --> 00:12:00,041
Over...? What does,
that even mean...?

214
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:03,083
You know, if I'm not mistaken,
Haruka is your friend too.

215
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:05,875
You're wrong.

216
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:07,791
She's not my friend anymore

217
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:12,000
as far as I'm concerned.
I betrayed her.

218
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:17,875
Do you still feel
responsible for her accident?

219
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:22,583
Be honest, do you pity Haruka?

220
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:26,833
Or do you love her?

221
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:47,041
Takayuki!

222
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:51,125
I'll stop seeing her
if that's what you want.

223
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:11,375
What's up with
Mr. Goody Two Shoes today?

224
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:14,250
He's usually hurrying
to get out of here by now.

225
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:15,541
Maybe he's sad.

226
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:18,166
Yeah... that would
be freaking awesome.

227
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:19,208
How come?

228
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:20,583
Because it's sweet payback

229
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:22,333
for all the crap he's
dealt to us over the years.

230
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:23,958
Thanks for staying
late Takayuki.

231
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:25,208
We appreciate the help.

232
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:26,291
It's... no problem.

233
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:27,791
I don't have much
going on right now

234
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:29,791
so I'll be able to work some
extra hours if you need me.

235
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:33,208
That's good to know son.

236
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:37,708
What's that all about?

237
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:39,958
Huh? What do you mean?

238
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:41,958
Do those two bother you
as much as they do me?

239
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:44,208
As a matter of fact they do.

240
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:45,500
So, Is it their
immature attitude

241
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:47,375
or their laziness
that bothers you?

242
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:50,208
It's a little of both,
but it's mostly personal.

243
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:52,750
Why does that
sound strange to you?

244
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:56,000
No it's just that I don't
think it's very appropriate.

245
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:56,875
What do you mean?

246
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:58,375
Well we're at work, for one,

247
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:00,791
and then there's the
obvious age difference.

248
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:06,916
No... I think, their
age is almost right on.

249
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,125
Is that so?

250
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:09,541
Truth is...

251
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:11,291
Years ago I had a
daughter of my own...

252
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:13,875
by now she'd be their age.

253
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:16,958
I miss her every
day that goes by.

254
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:19,083
Thinking back I wish

255
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:22,291
I would have spent
more time with her.

256
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,333
It's sad to think
the view outside

257
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:28,375
her hospital window was all
she had those last few months.

258
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:14,041
Your total comes to
twenty six hundred yen sir.

259
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:16,750
And thank you very much
for coming in this evening.

260
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:54,125
Oh, hey. Are you
going somewhere?

261
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:55,291
Yeah.

262
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:57,375
Where...? I thought
you had the day off.

263
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:58,666
That's why
I bought all this food.

264
00:15:58,750 --> 00:15:59,916
I was going to
make us some dinner.

265
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,708
My manager said he had
extra hours available

266
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:02,916
if I wanted them.

267
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,083
Since I'm not going
to the hospital anymore

268
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:06,000
I figured I'd grab
some more shifts.

269
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:08,541
That is what you wanted right?

270
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:22,500
Yo! Table three's up!

271
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:24,083
Fine.

272
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:26,625
Ayu! It's so busy
my head's starting to spin!

273
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:28,833
It's just the
dinner rush...

274
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:30,125
You can't keep
the pathetic cattle

275
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:32,250
from their daily
gorging now can you?

276
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:35,000
You better get moving.

277
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:36,250
Table six looks like they're
about to run out on the check.

278
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:39,333
Oh, let them. I don't
even care anymore.

279
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:49,875
Aw, man

280
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:55,291
Akane?

281
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:02,291
Wait hold up...

282
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:04,791
I wonder if something
happened to Haruka?

283
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:07,625
Yo, jerk ass!

284
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:08,750
Get back in here already...!

285
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:09,875
What are you
throwing out the trash

286
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:12,041
or crying in the
rain like a baby?!

287
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:23,208
Sky Temple Restaurant.

288
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:24,375
Yeah sure...

289
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:25,916
Hold on let me go find him okay?

290
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,875
Takayuki! The phone's for you!

291
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:30,291
Alright.

292
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:31,875
Here.

293
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:33,208
Thanks.

294
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:34,875
Hi, this is Takayuki.

295
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:36,333
Can I help you with something?

296
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:38,041
It's me.

297
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:40,041
What's going on?

298
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:43,083
Um, I was just
sitting here and...

299
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:45,333
Look I think we need to talk.

300
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:48,166
Mind if I come visit you?

301
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,666
Can't it wait 'till later?

302
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,166
No I...

303
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,208
Where'd that stupid meathead go?

304
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:57,958
We need his help on
the floor bussing tables.

305
00:17:58,041 --> 00:17:59,791
Takayuki just took a phone call

306
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:01,375
from some chick then
the next thing I knew

307
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:03,083
he was headed out of here.

308
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,583
That scumbag!

309
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:20,833
That's weird.

310
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:21,791
He usually stops to say 'hi'.

311
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:23,000
I know.

312
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,291
Takayuki...! You startled me.

313
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:29,958
I'm sorry, Are you okay?

314
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:31,583
Of course I'm okay...

315
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:32,958
What's up?

316
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:38,958
Why did you come so late?

317
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:40,250
I was I've been expecting you

318
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:42,875
since you promised
to come by every day.

319
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:44,541
I know, it's just...

320
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:46,250
Is it hard on you?

321
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,791
The entrance exams.

322
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:50,333
Right. Yeah.

323
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:51,500
Don't work too hard now.

324
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:55,000
I'm sure you'll ace those tests.

325
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,708
I really admire all the
time you put into studying.,.

326
00:18:57,791 --> 00:19:00,541
You're going to be
so successful in life.

327
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,750
I'm not much help here,

328
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:06,000
but I'll be thinking of you,
when you start taking them.

329
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:08,083
I'll be praying for you.

330
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:11,833
I'm done.

331
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:13,166
Would you mind
throwing this away?

332
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,458
Sure.

333
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:33,916
I felt so alone today...

334
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,916
Thanks for coming to see me.

335
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:42,708
Takayuki.

336
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:03,666
I'm so happy, I was afraid
you didn't like me anymore.

337
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,041
Don't be ridiculous...

338
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:07,291
That's just impossible.

339
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,541
Because I...

340
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:13,208
Wait... I know what
you're trying to say.

341
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:15,500
I'm in love with
you too Takayuki.

342
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,291
Haruka.

343
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:21,458
I'd love it if you
took me to the Festival

344
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:22,791
when it comes back.

345
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:23,958
Next time I promise.

346
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:25,541
It will be just the two of us.

347
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:27,541
Once you're all better

348
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:29,958
and the doctors let you out
of here we'll go together...

349
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:31,625
I'll be waiting for you.

350
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:33,333
No.

351
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:35,500
I want you to take
me as soon as possible.

352
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:38,125
I don't want to wait anymore.

353
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:44,625
Alright.

354
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:47,000
I love you.

355
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:13,583
Is something wrong?

356
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,416
Let's not rush into anything...

357
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,833
I think we should
take our time...

358
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:22,041
and savor every moment
we have together...

359
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:23,500
That okay?

360
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:37,208
Takayuki.

361
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:40,416
I can't, do this anymore.

362
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:34,625
They kissed!

363
00:23:34,708 --> 00:23:36,333
I don't believe this!

364
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:37,541
They kissed!

365
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:38,458
It's so crazy!

366
00:23:38,541 --> 00:23:39,333
A kiss!

367
00:23:39,416 --> 00:23:40,000
A kiss!!

368
00:23:40,083 --> 00:23:40,666
A kiss!

369
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:41,458
A kiss!!

370
00:23:41,541 --> 00:23:42,833
Rewind.

371
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,500
They kissed!

372
00:23:45,583 --> 00:23:46,750
I still can't believe it!

373
00:23:46,833 --> 00:23:47,500
They kissed!

374
00:23:47,583 --> 00:23:48,416
Yeah I know!

375
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,291
A kiss!

376
00:23:49,375 --> 00:23:51,125
A kiss!!

377
00:23:55,583 --> 00:23:56,125
Kiss!

378
00:23:56,208 --> 00:23:56,750
Kiss!!

379
00:23:56,833 --> 00:23:57,333
Kiss!

380
00:23:57,416 --> 00:23:58,208
Kiss!!

381
00:23:58,291 --> 00:24:00,000
Kiss!
