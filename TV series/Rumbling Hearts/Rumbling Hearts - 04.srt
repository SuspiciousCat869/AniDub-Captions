1
00:01:46,083 --> 00:01:47,208
I'm outta here.

2
00:01:47,291 --> 00:01:49,375
Oh, by the way,
I can't make it out tonight.

3
00:01:49,458 --> 00:01:50,875
Okay.

4
00:01:54,166 --> 00:01:56,791
Mitsuki... The whole
living together situation.

5
00:01:56,875 --> 00:01:58,166
What should we do about it?

6
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:01,708
Um, let's just forget about it.

7
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:03,000
Forget about it...?

8
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:05,000
But you suggested it
in the first place...

9
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,583
Are you sure about this?

10
00:02:06,666 --> 00:02:08,791
Positive...

11
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:10,500
I guess I just
got carried away...

12
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:13,083
Plus, it's not like we're
getting married or anything.

13
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:15,458
Yeah, okay.

14
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:17,000
Bye.

15
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:31,750
A cherry blossom.

16
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:37,791
I gotta get over
to the hospital.

17
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:39,250
Hopefully I can make it there

18
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:41,166
before visiting hours
end for the day...

19
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,083
I'll see ya.

20
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:55,041
Check it out, sis...
Cherry blossoms.

21
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:57,416
They're from the tree
in front of the school...

22
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,708
Do you remember that?

23
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:08,333
If you don't wake up soon,
life will pass you by.

24
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,750
Really...

25
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:13,791
You're moving at a snail's
pace here, Haruka. Huh...

26
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:16,583
Weird, it was sunny
just a few minutes ago.

27
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:53,458
Um, gimme a second.

28
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:55,250
Oh! This looks good.

29
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:58,166
Hey, you wanna split
a salad or something?

30
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,541
Oh, or maybe
I could get a reuben.

31
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:14,500
Afternoon.

32
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:16,958
Ms. Ishida... You're
here early, aren't you?

33
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:18,958
Oh, I just had to
pick up some paperwork...

34
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:21,333
It didn't take me as
long as I had expected.

35
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:23,208
What are you copying...?

36
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:27,833
Wait, I thought I told you
we didn't need copies of this.

37
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:29,666
Oh, you did? I don't remember.

38
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:33,208
I've noticed you haven't
been yourself, lately...

39
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:35,708
Is everything okay with you...?
Wanna talk about?

40
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:38,500
No actually everything
is fine with me...

41
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:42,208
I just wasn't concentrating...
I'll be more careful.

42
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:47,666
We need a seafood sampler
and a burger platter.

43
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,500
And can we rush
that order please!

44
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:50,958
Coming right up!

45
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:06,541
Hello. Hazawa Trading... Yes.

46
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:09,083
Yeah... She's right
in front of me.

47
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:11,333
Is that... for me?

48
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:13,708
It's your man.

49
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:17,458
He is your boyfriend...

50
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:19,000
Calling to check on
you while you're working,

51
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:22,166
that's usually a good sign that
it's getting pretty serious.

52
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,625
Yeah.

53
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:26,458
Talk to him like
he's a client...

54
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:29,416
That way, the others won't know.

55
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:36,083
Thanks for holding.
Can I help you?

56
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:37,875
Hey, it's me, babe.

57
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:39,416
Sorry to call you at work.

58
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,375
I tried your cell, but it
wouldn't go over to voicemail.

59
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:43,875
I was wondering...

60
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:46,125
Do you have any plans
for this evening...?

61
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:48,250
Around six-ish?

62
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:50,416
No, I'm free.

63
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,250
Cool. I'll meet you at
six at the Station...

64
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:59,083
Great... I'll call
you later, okay...? Bye.

65
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:03,250
Gotcha.

66
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:04,250
Look at that...!

67
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:05,916
We totally caught
him red-handed!

68
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,625
Excellent work there, Mayu.

69
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:09,416
How long have you
been standing there?

70
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,000
Well...! 'Hey, it's me, babe'...

71
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:14,416
Since about the
time you said that!

72
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,333
You know the store rules...

73
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,125
No personal phone calls allowed

74
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:18,666
on the office phone
during business hours!

75
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,708
What's going on over here?

76
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:23,250
Oh, just in time, sir.

77
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:24,291
For what?

78
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:25,416
We caught...

79
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,833
Mayu and I caught her using

80
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:28,583
the restaurant's phone
to make a personal call.

81
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:29,750
That's not true!

82
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:31,333
So, I guess you fell asleep

83
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:33,291
at the meeting when
we discussed this.

84
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:34,916
He's lying, sir...!

85
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,375
The one who made
the phone call is...

86
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:37,416
No! She did it!

87
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,375
No! Stop blaming it on me!

88
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:40,625
If you have to
make a personal call

89
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:42,041
you can always ask me...

90
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:44,041
But if you lie and
try to hide it, then...

91
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:46,375
I already told you,
it wasn't me!

92
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:47,583
Excuse me, sir...

93
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:48,916
If you don't mind we
have hungry customers

94
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,333
that we need to attend to...
Let's go, Mayu.

95
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,625
I like your attitude, son.

96
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:56,208
You're gonna pay for this!

97
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:59,833
Ayu... Was this
call long distance?

98
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:01,875
No... just forget it.

99
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:11,000
I hope you step in cat crap!

100
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,250
So what's the plan?

101
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:29,833
I wanted to look at something.

102
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:34,583
You said you'd like to find
a place around here, right?

103
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,166
The way I see it,

104
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,416
if we combine our paychecks
we could live in this area.

105
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:44,708
The most affordable places
seem to be on the south side...

106
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:46,291
Ooh... not that one.

107
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,250
Okay... It's starting
to get late, sis...

108
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:57,083
I have to go on home now.

109
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:04,375
I'm not trying
to forget, Haruka.

110
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:08,916
It's just that right now we
have ourselves to think about.

111
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,333
I seriously doubt
she would want us

112
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:14,083
to keep our lives on
hold until she wakes up.

113
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:16,250
Isn't that right?

114
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:19,250
Let's focus... on you and me.

115
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,333
So whaddaya say, Mitsuki...?

116
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:24,416
Let's find a home.

117
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:39,125
It's okay.

118
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:43,125
Takayuki...! Takayuki!

119
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:06,583
Akane! Akane!

120
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,708
Yeah! Woo-hoo!

121
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:17,333
Well, well...

122
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:19,541
Check out the speed demon...
Congratulations.

123
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,125
Thanks, but it's nothing...

124
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:22,875
It was only a
preliminary race...

125
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:24,416
It didn't mean anything.

126
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,208
Stop trying to be so modest...

127
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:28,416
I know you worked your
tail off for that race...

128
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,291
You must be exhausted.

129
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:32,541
Make sure you've
got time to relax...

130
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:33,791
You don't want to burn out.

131
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:36,333
Don't worry about me.

132
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:37,958
Oh I won't, dear...

133
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:40,083
Sorry I'm probably
bugging you, aren't I?

134
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:42,416
No. No, you're not
bugging me at all...

135
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,375
So how did
everything go today...?

136
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,000
With Haruka's checkup?

137
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:47,500
She's doing well...

138
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:49,375
Physically, she's a
picture of health...

139
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:51,250
If I could have my
way I would start her

140
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:53,291
on a rehab program right now

141
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:55,375
But I guess that's
not a possibility

142
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:57,625
until she decides to wake up.

143
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:01,916
Doctor Kozuki!

144
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,083
There you are.

145
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:04,750
Is there something wrong?

146
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:06,333
You could say that.

147
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:09,583
Mister Nagata in room 103 had
his daughter bring him alcohol!

148
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:12,333
Again? That's the
fourth time this month

149
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:16,208
this has happened...
You take it easy, Akane.

150
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:17,666
You too.

151
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,458
Every time we go in his room
he keeps flirting with us.

152
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:21,875
Yes, one of his more
endearing qualities.

153
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:29,666
Roll out the red carpet!

154
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,875
You'll never guess
what I did today...!

155
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:35,416
That's right, I won both of my
heats in the preliminary races.

156
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,166
I wish you could've seen me...

157
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:41,625
I was so far ahead
of everybody else.

158
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,500
That's strange.

159
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,250
Doctor! Doctor Kozuki!
My sister!

160
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:09,333
Doctor! Doctor, help!

161
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:39,000
Thanks for everything.

162
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:40,083
I'll make sure your next order

163
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:42,000
has all the Italian
cheese you need.

164
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:43,375
Have a nice day.

165
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:44,958
Thanks.

166
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:46,291
Okay, what's next?

167
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:49,375
So... Have you made
a final decision yet...?

168
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:50,416
The apartment?

169
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,000
What?

170
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:54,291
Oh... No, it's so hard to find
just the right place, you know?

171
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:55,208
At this rate you
two will split up

172
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:57,041
by the time you make a decision.

173
00:11:57,125 --> 00:12:00,875
You may be right about that one.

174
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,166
Say, you want to join me
for some dinner tonight?

175
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,291
I know of a great place
with the best gnocchi.

176
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:08,750
Oh, I'm sorry I can't...
I'm supposed to...

177
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:10,916
Hang out with him. I understand.

178
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,208
Yeah... How 'bout a rain check?

179
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:15,833
Here you go, darling.

180
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:17,166
Watch your tongue.

181
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:19,500
I made the curry a
little extra spicy tonight.

182
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,375
Hey, what!

183
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:21,875
You get the octopus from now on.

184
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:23,416
Huh? Why?!

185
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,208
'Cause your face turns
red when you get angry...

186
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:26,250
That's why.

187
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:27,416
How dare you!

188
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,791
See! There!

189
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:31,125
Jeez, you don't
have to hit me...

190
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,708
I'm just kidding around.

191
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:35,666
Fine, I know how to take a joke.

192
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,125
You can use my dolphin cup

193
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:39,000
if it's that important to you...

194
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:41,208
Come on, the food's
about to get cold...

195
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:42,375
Start eating, chubs.

196
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:43,500
Okay.

197
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:44,458
Let's eat.

198
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:46,208
Yeah, let's eat.

199
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:51,041
That's hot!

200
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:52,125
I warned you.

201
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:53,750
Don't you like
sweating from hot curry?

202
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:55,958
Not especially.

203
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:04,458
Are you gonna answer it?

204
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:06,375
No, it's probably
just the restaurant...

205
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:08,083
If I pick up they'll
want me to come in.

206
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:10,208
Hi, this is Takayuki.

207
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:13,125
I'm out right now or
I'm asleep or I'm busy.

208
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:14,875
At any rate,
I can't reach the phone.

209
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:16,541
Leave a message after the
beep and I'll call you back.

210
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:17,958
This is way too spicy for me.

211
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:25,375
Looks like no message.

212
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:26,875
Oh, you know what...

213
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:28,083
I bet it was Ayu.

214
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:29,291
She had to work two shifts today

215
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,125
and she's probably
pissed about it.

216
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:32,166
This is Akane.

217
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:35,541
I'm calling with some good news.

218
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:38,125
You'll be happy to hear it.

219
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:39,958
I should have phoned earlier,

220
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:42,958
but I just couldn't
bring myself to do it.

221
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:48,833
It's... It's my sister.

222
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,875
Haruka has come out of her coma.

223
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:58,166
She wants to see you, Takayuki.

224
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:00,625
More than anything.

225
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:04,166
That's all.

226
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,875
Wait! Akane!

227
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:12,458
Damn.

228
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,750
Akane?

229
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:30,625
I'm gonna go home, mom...

230
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:32,833
Are you gonna stay
here tonight with Haruka?

231
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:35,750
She's taking a nap right now...

232
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,416
I don't want her to be
alone when she wakes up.

233
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,208
She'll like that.

234
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:41,916
Oh, Mother...

235
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,875
I just left a message for
Takayuki about Haruka waking up.

236
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:04,500
I can't go to the hospital.

237
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:09,041
I can't do it.

238
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:13,875
Why can't you...?
Haruka is our good friend.

239
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:22,541
If you decide not
to go and visit her...

240
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:25,958
you'll regret it every day
for the rest of your life.

241
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:30,375
I just... I'd hate
to see you go back

242
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:33,583
to being your
old self, Takayuki.

243
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:48,208
Let's go there together...
Tomorrow morning.

244
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:11,916
It's gonna be fine.

245
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,166
Why hello, there.

246
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:29,416
It's been quite a while
since I've seen you here.

247
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,458
Doctor Kozuki, hello

248
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:33,583
And you... you're Mitsuki right?

249
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:34,416
That's right...

250
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,291
It's good to see you again.

251
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:38,791
Your hair... It looks
different from before.

252
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:42,041
Oh, yeah. Does it look bad?

253
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:45,916
Follow me...
I'll show you the way.

254
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,708
Takayuki. What are
you doing nowadays?

255
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:52,916
I've just been working
part time as a waiter.

256
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,166
Oh, then I guess you gave up
on your entrance exams.

257
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:59,708
Well, sort of... Yeah.

258
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:01,333
It's been a few weeks now

259
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:03,000
since she came out of her coma.

260
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:05,166
Physically, she's
doing fantastic...

261
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,458
I'll let you in to
see her now, but...

262
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:09,791
It's very important that
you remember one detail

263
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:11,125
when talking to her.

264
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:13,125
What... What is it?

265
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:15,250
The passage of time...

266
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:18,708
Don't tell her she's been
under for three years now...

267
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:20,791
Her mind can't comprehend that.

268
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:22,666
I don't understand.

269
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,083
Anterograde amnesia.

270
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:28,166
For her, time stopped on
the day of the accident.

271
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,416
But that's crazy.

272
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,958
I'm counting on you two.

273
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:41,666
Hey! There you are...

274
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:44,625
You have visitors...
A few of your friends.

275
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:00,750
Takayuki.

276
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:04,333
Haruka, hi.

277
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,125
It's so good to see you...

278
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:07,791
Thank you for coming.

279
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:11,166
Um, yeah.

280
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:16,708
What's the matter...?
You look depressed.

281
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:20,666
Sorry.

282
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:23,750
No... Don't be sorry, Takayuki.

283
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:25,750
If anyone should
be sorry it's me...

284
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:28,791
I never meant to make
you all worry so much.

285
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:45,791
Takayuki?

286
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,791
What's the matter...?
Aren't you happy?

287
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:56,666
Haruka.

288
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:04,083
It's gonna be okay.

289
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:19,041
Stop. You're gonna
make me cry, too.

290
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:23,791
Haruka.

291
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:25,958
Mitsuki! Thanks for coming.

292
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:28,875
I'm so glad you're
feeling better, sweetheart.

293
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:31,208
Thank you, Mitsuki...

294
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:34,125
Oh no... the children's book
exhibit is over by now.

295
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:37,791
There's supposed to be
another exhibit in a month...

296
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:38,791
By then...

297
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:40,166
Second semester
will have started

298
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,166
and I'll be so busy studying
for the entrance exams

299
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,625
that I probably
won't be able to go.

300
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:47,333
We were supposed to go
together, Takayuki...

301
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:49,500
Sorry I couldn't make our date.

302
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:53,000
Oh, don't worry about it.
It's no big deal.

303
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:55,541
There'll be another one this
summer once school's over.

304
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:56,916
Then you'll have all
the time in the world

305
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,625
to go check out the exhibit...

306
00:19:58,708 --> 00:19:59,916
And if you don't want
to wait that long,

307
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,125
I'm sure you can find
a break this semester...

308
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:03,750
Right, Big Brother?

309
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:05,458
Uh, yeah.

310
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:06,291
But I...

311
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:07,750
Your sister's right, Haruka.

312
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:09,791
There will be plenty of
chances to go next time.

313
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,208
What's most
important right now...

314
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:13,750
is for you to make
a full recovery.

315
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:18,500
Mistuki, hello...
Thanks for coming by.

316
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:21,250
You're such a good friend to me.

317
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:22,750
Alright.

318
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:24,833
It's time to take your
temperature, Haruka.

319
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:30,625
You're a bit feverish...

320
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:33,083
You must be exhausted...
I'm sorry, but...

321
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:35,625
I think it's about time
for you guys to go.

322
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:38,166
Why don't you lie down and rest?

323
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:44,125
I'll lower the bed
for you... There you go.

324
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:51,708
Are you okay?

325
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:53,250
We need to talk.

326
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:01,625
Takayuki, why did
you have to come

327
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:03,083
to the hospital with Mitsuki...?

328
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:04,708
Seriously, what was
the point of bringing her

329
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:06,458
into my sister's room with you?

330
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:07,666
Akane.

331
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,208
And why are you even here...?

332
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:10,750
Was it just so you
could show my sister

333
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:12,875
how close you are
to her boyfriend?

334
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:15,083
I can't believe you'd come here

335
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:19,875
and act like you give a
crap about her! I hate you!

336
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:21,583
Akane!

337
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:22,708
It's okay, Takayuki.

338
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:23,916
But...

339
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,666
It's all right... I'm fine.

340
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,625
You guys make me sick...

341
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:30,541
You ignore my sister
for three entire years

342
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:32,916
when she was in a coma,
and the whole time

343
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,333
you were hooking up with
each other behind her back!

344
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:36,291
Akane, please listen.

345
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:37,375
I don't wanna hear it!

346
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:40,666
My sister's best
friend betrayed her...

347
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,166
How could you do that...?

348
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,916
Tell me... Aren't you
ashamed of yourself...?

349
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,583
Do you feel any guilt at all?

350
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:48,625
I'm sorry.

351
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:50,041
Takayuki.

352
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:51,625
My sister needs you now.

353
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:53,416
She wants you to be by her side.

354
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:57,250
Yet you just stand there with
that stupid look on your face.

355
00:21:57,333 --> 00:22:00,333
You're nothing but a coward.

356
00:23:32,875 --> 00:23:34,541
Are you really gonna
go through with it, Ayu?

357
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:35,625
Of course I am.

358
00:23:35,708 --> 00:23:36,791
Why should she get
the most attention

359
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:38,666
when all she does
is sleep all day...

360
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,666
You ready?

361
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:40,500
Right behind ya.

362
00:23:40,583 --> 00:23:42,291
Here we go!

363
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:44,583
Quick run!

364
00:23:44,666 --> 00:23:45,916
Right away!

365
00:23:59,375 --> 00:24:00,250
What's up?

366
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:01,708
I am.
