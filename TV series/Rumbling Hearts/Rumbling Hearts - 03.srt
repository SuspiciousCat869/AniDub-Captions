1
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,166
This isn't even close
to what I ordered!

2
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:04,416
Yeah.

3
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,250
I ordered the
strawberry parfait...

4
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:07,916
Not the French onion soup.

5
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,166
Don't you understand that?

6
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,833
Strawberry parfait, genius...

7
00:02:10,916 --> 00:02:13,291
Take this and go get me
what I ordered, 'kay?

8
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:14,708
Uh, huh.

9
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:15,833
What are you, chicky?

10
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:17,541
Some kinda flippin' retard?

11
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:18,625
Whatever.

12
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:20,791
Hello? This is
your fault, twerp!

13
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:22,541
Just apologize and fix it...

14
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:23,708
Now, scurry along.

15
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:25,000
Mm-hm.

16
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:26,458
You suck!

17
00:02:26,541 --> 00:02:28,500
Would you just get me
the food I ordered?!

18
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:29,375
Right.

19
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:31,208
I said I wanted my food!

20
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:32,458
Ok.

21
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:34,458
Oh... this isn't good...

22
00:02:34,541 --> 00:02:36,500
What'll we do?

23
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:39,041
Same as usual.

24
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:41,208
Where are you going?!

25
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:43,333
I'm gonna get
the problem solver.

26
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:45,875
Okay, but make it fast,
before Ayu gets...

27
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:50,125
Welcome to Sky Temple.

28
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:53,708
Table for one this evening?

29
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:55,250
Are you just gonna stand
there like a zombie...

30
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:56,916
or are you gonna be a good skirt

31
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,208
and get me my food?

32
00:02:58,291 --> 00:02:59,458
Sure.

33
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:01,041
Little runt... I'm gonna--

34
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:02,541
I'm anything but little.

35
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:04,166
Shut up!

36
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:08,250
Dude... Now that's funny.

37
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:10,125
I ordered a
strawberry parfait...

38
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:13,333
and, I'm gonna get
a strawberry parfait.

39
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:16,833
Would you like
some French fries--

40
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,750
You know, you've got one
heck of a set on ya, Mister!

41
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:22,041
Just because you're unhappy

42
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:23,875
with the person you've
become doesn't mean

43
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:25,250
you can take it out on me!

44
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:26,416
You're nuts!

45
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,791
Shut up!

46
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,833
You think you can walk
in here and pick a fight...

47
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:31,125
guess what...

48
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:32,583
You picked the wrong girl

49
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:34,500
at the wrong restaurant
on the wrong day,

50
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:36,125
ya slimy bottom-feeder...!

51
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:37,625
Now, bring it on!!

52
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:39,541
What kinda place are
you guys running here...?

53
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:40,833
You're supposed to
serve the customers,

54
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:42,250
not pick fights with them!

55
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:43,208
Yeah...?

56
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:44,583
Well, I got a few other ideas of

57
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:46,458
what we should do
with the customers--

58
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:50,416
Ayu... What've
I told you about this?

59
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,333
Let go of me, ya sewer rat!

60
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:56,125
I apologize for
her behavior, sirs...

61
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:58,208
I'll have the parfait
brought out immediately.

62
00:03:58,291 --> 00:04:00,083
Don't do that! They suck!

63
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:01,208
It's over, Ayu.

64
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:04,125
Let it go...
Again, I'm sorry for this.

65
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:05,583
You should have
her cleaning toilets,

66
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:06,750
not working the floor!

67
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:08,166
Yeah... Keep talking!

68
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,000
I'll find you in
the parking lot!

69
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,791
Hey! Get off me.

70
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:14,833
Stop fighting
and get back there!

71
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:24,750
I can't seem to figure out
what your deal is...

72
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:26,083
Who mixes up strawberry parfait

73
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,916
with French onion soup
and then gets ticked off

74
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,250
at the customer for it?

75
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:30,375
Shut up!

76
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:31,833
You idiot.

77
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:33,708
I am not...! You're the idiot!

78
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:35,416
You think so?

79
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,375
Takayuki, great work out there.

80
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:40,166
Oh... Thank you, sir.

81
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,500
The customer is always right

82
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:43,041
and you always
seem to know that.

83
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:44,541
You were wonderful out there.

84
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:46,791
I wish I could handle
things as well as you do.

85
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:49,333
Well, it's not the customers
who are hard to handle.

86
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:50,125
It's Ayu.

87
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:51,791
I am not hard to handle!!

88
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,125
As you can tell by the fact

89
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:55,000
that you pulled my cheeks
until they're beet red!

90
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:56,375
I better get back on the floor.

91
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:57,375
Sounds good.

92
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:59,583
Are you even listening to me?

93
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:00,875
Wait!

94
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:02,583
Stop making a
scene out here, Ayu.

95
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:04,166
I'm not making a scene!

96
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,541
And I sure as hell ain't
finished with you...!

97
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:09,000
It's time we went to town!

98
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:10,208
What?

99
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:11,291
That guy was right...

100
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:13,708
You should be
cleaning the toilets.

101
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:17,208
And you... you can go...

102
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:21,333
Step in cat crap!

103
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:24,333
Do you want this job...?

104
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:25,666
'Cause I don't think
you have any idea

105
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,333
how nice a restaurant this is.

106
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:28,666
I know more than you think I do!

107
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,333
You're an idiot...

108
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:32,000
And idiots wash the dishes...

109
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:34,000
I don't wanna see you out here.

110
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,708
Not the dishes!

111
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:39,500
I'm sorry everybody.
Please enjoy your meals.

112
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:48,375
Mitsuki...

113
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:50,000
So...

114
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:52,208
You got women waving at you.

115
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:53,291
So what?

116
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:54,958
Do you have any
idea who she is...

117
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:56,250
'cause she's pretty.

118
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:58,166
She is a hot number...

119
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,333
Is that your girlfriend
or just an admirer?

120
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:01,333
She's no one.

121
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:03,666
No... You're lying...

122
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,833
I can so tell.

123
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:05,916
That's enough...

124
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,666
You're supposed
to be washing dishes.

125
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,541
You don't have to push!

126
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:11,250
Cut it out!

127
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:12,416
I just wanted to know

128
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,666
if that's the girlfriend
we've heard about!

129
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,083
Get off!

130
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:22,000
What's up? You're so quiet.

131
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:23,625
You seem distracted.

132
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:25,125
Yeah.

133
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:27,500
Come on. What's bothering you?

134
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:30,583
It's just, this
is the first time

135
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:33,041
I've ever seen you at work.

136
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:36,125
Do you actually
enjoy working there?

137
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:38,416
Not really. But it's a job.

138
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,750
Oh, well it looked fun.

139
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,083
You looked happy.

140
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:47,375
Come on in. How many?

141
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:48,708
There'll be three.

142
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:50,833
Our friend will be meeting us.

143
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:52,791
Yo...! Takayuki...! Mitsuki...!

144
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:54,125
I got us a table!

145
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:56,000
I guess he's already here.

146
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,625
Sorry, I started without you.

147
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,125
That's cool.

148
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:02,458
Man, it feels like forever
since the three of us hung out.

149
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:03,833
I thought you were
gonna be running late?

150
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:04,666
What happened?

151
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,000
Did your plans fall through?

152
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:07,916
Yeah, my date cancelled
on me at the last minute,

153
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,583
so I thought I'd head
on over and start eating.

154
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:11,541
What was her excuse?

155
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:12,583
Is she your girlfriend?

156
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:13,708
She said that the deadline

157
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:15,166
for her article
got changed again

158
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,458
so she was gonna have
to pull an all-nighter.

159
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:19,791
And is she my girlfriend...? No.

160
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:22,708
Cheers!

161
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:25,041
Cheers!

162
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:30,291
Excuse me...

163
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:33,791
This will only take
a second. Hello?

164
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:36,583
I'm not surprised...

165
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:38,625
So they'll have eight more, huh?

166
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,666
Then go ahead and
make the reservation

167
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,750
for twenty, that'll give us
the whole back room...

168
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:44,000
Right.

169
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:46,375
Great, thanks.
I'll see ya tomorrow.

170
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,166
Sorry about that.

171
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,458
Sounds like you're
throwing a party.

172
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:51,791
Some retirement for
an old-timer I work with.

173
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:53,708
Can you believe they
put me in charge of it?

174
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:55,791
Oh, man, what
were they thinking?

175
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:58,166
Come on, dude;
I'm different these days...

176
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,750
I'm good at my job
and the people

177
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:01,541
who work for me
really respect me.

178
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:03,625
I guess things are really
looking up for you.

179
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:07,250
Yeah and what about you...
Mr. Part-Timer?

180
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:09,416
Those waitresses
working under you are hot.

181
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,791
I've seen 'em.

182
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:12,166
Bet you've been with
every one of 'em, haven't you?

183
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,791
What... n-no... I...

184
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:14,708
You want some of that.

185
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:15,791
Especially the blonde...

186
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:17,041
There's a lady at the table.

187
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:18,375
So, uh, Mitsuki...

188
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:19,250
How's your work...?

189
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,375
Have you moved up in the world,

190
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:21,625
unlike Takayuki here?

191
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:23,541
Uh, no...

192
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:25,708
It's a small company so there's
really no ladder to climb.

193
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:26,916
I'm kinda stuck...

194
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,208
They're so shorthanded,
and they won't hire

195
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:30,916
any new people,
so they moved me to sales.

196
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,125
Lots of overtime, though.

197
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:33,500
That's the one upside, yeah...

198
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:35,416
But if I hadn't been
out on sales calls all

199
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,500
afternoon they would have
kept me there all night.

200
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,041
So, since I was out anyway...

201
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:41,541
I just kinda figured
I wouldn't go back tonight.

202
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:42,666
Smart move.

203
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:43,958
So both of you are still single

204
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:45,541
and work so much that
you can't be bothered

205
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:49,000
with taking the
time to date someone.

206
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:51,708
That's right.

207
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:58,875
I'll call you guys next week.

208
00:08:58,958 --> 00:08:59,833
Good seeing you, man!

209
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:01,083
Take care!

210
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,333
Time sure flies, doesn't it...?

211
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:05,541
I know it's kinda late...

212
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:07,500
but we can still do
something if you want.

213
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,625
You know...

214
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:12,416
The only thing I wanna do
tonight is stay in your arms...

215
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,875
Is that okay?

216
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:38,500
I want you.

217
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:39,666
Me, too.

218
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,458
But, I...

219
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:50,250
Takayuki...

220
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:15,666
Hey...

221
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,458
You know that
world aquarium downtown?

222
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:20,125
Yeah.

223
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:21,375
They have sea otters ...

224
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:22,875
You wanna go see
'em this weekend...

225
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:24,750
They're supposed to
be really beautiful.

226
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:25,875
Sea otters?

227
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,625
Yeah. What about Sunday?

228
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:28,875
I can't Sunday.

229
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:30,166
I've got a double shift at work.

230
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:35,250
Oh, I understand.

231
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:36,833
How 'bout next weekend?

232
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:39,125
Wha--what are you doing?

233
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:44,208
So... let's move in together?

234
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:46,166
We could be like
this all the time

235
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,750
without having to plan so much.

236
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:48,750
Yeah...

237
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:50,000
We could get a cat...

238
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,583
And we could move into a
place twice this size...

239
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:54,000
Sound nice?

240
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:55,041
Oh, come on...

241
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:56,750
We can't afford
anything like that.

242
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:58,708
Not even with our
salaries combined.

243
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,541
Yeah.

244
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:02,583
I guess you're right...

245
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:05,875
I don't know what
I was thinking, just then.

246
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:19,416
Go, Mitsuki! You can do it!

247
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,291
Hurry...! You're winning!

248
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:28,208
Finishing first, lane
three, Mitsuki Hayase!

249
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:32,916
It's nice out there today.

250
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,375
Okay, I'm leaving for work.

251
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:36,833
Hey, you know you
should try to spend

252
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:39,541
some time outdoors, even
if it is just on the balcony.

253
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:41,666
Uh-huh. Have a good one.

254
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:44,875
I'll do my best.

255
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:46,583
Mitsuki?

256
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:48,125
Uh-huh?

257
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:51,125
Do you really want
to live together?

258
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:53,250
Well, you said it last night.

259
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:55,833
And I was just thinking,
maybe we should.

260
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:57,541
You could move in.

261
00:11:57,625 --> 00:11:59,125
You mean live here...?

262
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:00,375
In your place?

263
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:04,291
Yeah, right...
Isn't that what you wanted?

264
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:12,333
Well...

265
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:21,375
I dunno... We can
talk about this later.

266
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:23,458
I'm running late.

267
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:36,541
This place hasn't changed
since before the accident...

268
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:38,166
I can't live here.

269
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,750
Downtown train is
arriving at Platform Two.

270
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:46,041
Please stand clear
until the train has come

271
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:47,583
to a complete stop.

272
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,583
Mitsuki, is everything lined up

273
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:09,000
for today's sales meetings?

274
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:10,333
Yes, ma'am.

275
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:12,416
There're more samples
there than you're used to,

276
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,666
but I bet you can handle it...

277
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:14,833
You're still young.

278
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:16,250
Of course.

279
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:22,500
Looks like you had a fun time

280
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:25,166
with your boyfriend last night.

281
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:26,791
You're wearing the same
clothes from yesterday...

282
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:29,000
It's kinda tacky.

283
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:31,791
You need to be more mindful
about your appearance...

284
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:34,416
A professional look
is important in sales.

285
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,291
It won't happen again...
I'm sorry.

286
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:38,333
Well...

287
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:39,708
The only reason
I noticed is because

288
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:41,583
I used to do the same thing.

289
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:50,958
I can't believe you
got a driver's license!

290
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:52,750
Yup. It's sweet.

291
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,458
I'm so jealous of you...

292
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:55,875
This is the coolest ever.

293
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:58,750
It took me three years to
get my hands on this card.

294
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:00,083
You for real...?

295
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:02,000
It only took you three years
to get your license?

296
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:04,291
I was the fastest learner
in my whole class.

297
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:05,791
You mind telling me
what you two are doing

298
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:07,500
on the floor instead of working?

299
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:10,000
We're just having
a little chat...

300
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:12,083
Now feast your eyes on this!

301
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:15,083
What...?! Are you stupid?

302
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:16,375
What are you talking about?

303
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:17,916
This is my driver's license...

304
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,375
Hot off the presses.

305
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,083
I thought you said
you hadn't driven

306
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:23,291
anything since you got your
learner's permit last year.

307
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:24,166
So what...?

308
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,041
That doesn't change a thing...

309
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:26,208
I still got my license

310
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:27,708
and there's nothing
you can do about it.

311
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:29,416
Why would I want to...?

312
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,666
Anyway, there's
nothing to brag about

313
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,000
if you're not going to use it.

314
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:33,333
Would you go away?!

315
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:35,375
Mayu, listen,
if someone like her can get

316
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,833
one of those, then you should
be able to with no problems.

317
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:39,333
Wow... You really think so?

318
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:41,416
Stop making fun of me,
you sewer rat!

319
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:43,083
I wasn't making fun of you.

320
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:45,041
He's telling the truth.

321
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:46,791
You're not my friend...

322
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:49,750
I hadn't ever planned on getting
my driver's license anyway.

323
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:50,958
So it's no big deal.

324
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:53,041
Really...? How come?

325
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:54,166
Because I'm scared...

326
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,041
I'd hate to be in an accident.

327
00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:59,708
Yes... accidents are scary...

328
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:01,333
They can ruin
your life forever...

329
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:04,125
and that's precisely why
I don't drive anywhere...

330
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:06,208
Is that a good enough
reason for you, rat?!

331
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:09,208
What...? Oh, did
you say something?

332
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:10,416
I wasn't listening.

333
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:13,000
Cut it out, guys...

334
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:15,208
We got tables out there
full of hungry people.

335
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:16,958
Sure... I'm going.

336
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,875
I'm not done with
you yet, you filthy pig!!

337
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:21,708
Calm down, Ayu.

338
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:25,416
It's a pleasure
doing business with you.

339
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:30,541
Okay. We only have two more
to do so let's hurry...

340
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:33,125
After that let's grab
some lunch. I'm hungry

341
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:34,625
Okay.

342
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:36,916
I tell you, I didn't think
that guy would ever shut up.

343
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,375
I wish our clients would
consider our time for a change.

344
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:41,166
But that would require
thoughtful clients,

345
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,875
which I don't know if we have.

346
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:44,541
Are they heavy?

347
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:46,125
Oh, no... I guess
I'm just not used

348
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:47,708
to all this walking around.

349
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:49,416
Yeah.

350
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,125
You'll get used to it;
we all do.

351
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:54,166
Maybe I should
start working out.

352
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:03,125
So you have a big date tonight?

353
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:06,208
Uh... No, not really.

354
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:07,875
Don't like your
job much, do you?

355
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:09,291
What?

356
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:10,750
It's not what you had planned.

357
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:12,416
Well, it's not what
I had planned either,

358
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,333
but you roll with the punches.

359
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:18,583
So how are things going
with your boyfriend?

360
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:21,458
Oh... not bad...

361
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:25,000
Sorry...!
Just making conversation.

362
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:27,750
Oh... Things are moving along...

363
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:30,208
Just kinda slowly.

364
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:54,958
Yay, Mitsuki! You can do it!

365
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:57,750
What's wrong?

366
00:16:57,833 --> 00:16:58,833
What?

367
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:00,458
You... zoned out...

368
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:01,666
Is something wrong?

369
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:05,250
Oh, I'm sorry...
I got distracted.

370
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:08,500
Ouch.

371
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:09,291
Mitsuki...!

372
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,375
Are you all right?

373
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:13,000
I'm fine.

374
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:17,666
Oh, no. I'm so clumsy.

375
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,875
Takayuki?

376
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:29,500
I'm sorry to bother you,
but can we meet later?

377
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:32,000
I'll be at the
station around seven.

378
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:44,875
Hey, you.

379
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:49,791
You alright?

380
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:03,500
You haven't touched
your noodles...

381
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,291
Something wrong?

382
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,041
Yes.

383
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:10,583
Let's be honest with
each other. About us.

384
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:14,375
Ok, I'm just gonna come
right out and tell you...

385
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:18,250
I can't do this...
It's like we're standing still.

386
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:19,625
And I love you, Takayuki.

387
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:22,208
I can't help it.
I really love you.

388
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:24,916
But I need to know...

389
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,291
Do you love me, too?

390
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:44,500
Of course, I love you.

391
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:45,875
You do?

392
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,125
More than you know.

393
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:50,375
Oh, Takayuki...

394
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:52,750
I'm so happy you said that.

395
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:55,666
So you were serious about
the whole moving in thing?

396
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,041
Yeah...

397
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:59,333
If that's what you want
then I'm all for it...

398
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:01,000
It'll be fun.

399
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:05,291
This is important,
so we need to take our time.

400
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:07,750
I don't want to just get
into the first place we find.

401
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:13,750
I want it to be our place.
Our decision. Together.

402
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:15,541
I want that, too.

403
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:20,958
You ready?

404
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:27,458
You're so warm...

405
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,875
You know what...

406
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:32,875
I wanna stay like this with
you for as long as we can.

407
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:35,250
Then I'll be right next
to you the whole time.

408
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:38,625
Yeah... That's what I want.

409
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:41,666
Are you gonna stay over tonight?

410
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,083
Can't.

411
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:44,666
My boss noticed I wore the
same clothes as yesterday.

412
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,041
So nothing for you tonight.

413
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:48,083
You're just gonna have
to make do on your own.

414
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:51,458
Arm-in-arm will have
to do for us this evening.

415
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:53,083
Okay.

416
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:08,291
This year's swim team.

417
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:14,125
From our old school... Neat.

418
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:18,666
Thanks so much for the burger!

419
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:23,000
Yeah, thanks a lot...
Captain Suzumiya.

420
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:25,166
Don't worry about it, guys...

421
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,500
And enough with this
'captain' stuff.

422
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:27,791
Call me Akane.

423
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:29,625
Besides, hanging out
with you guys is a blast.

424
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:31,000
But you're gonna
have to train harder

425
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:32,541
if you want me
to keep this up...

426
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:33,916
Here, I'll light
a fire under you.

427
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,583
Tomorrow the slowest
lap time buys me dinner!

428
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:38,375
But that'll be me.

429
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:41,458
Maybe not, you know...
Tomorrow is a new day.

430
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:45,541
It's getting late.

431
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:46,583
We should call it a night...

432
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:48,458
You three be safe
going home, ok.

433
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:51,375
We will! Thank you, Akane.

434
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,250
Have a good night!

435
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:58,291
Good, I still have time.

436
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:06,250
Akane...

437
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:14,583
Akane... Seems like ages.

438
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:16,875
I haven't seen you
in a while, Takayuki.

439
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:20,541
I gotta get over
to the hospital...

440
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:22,000
Hopefully I can make it there

441
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:25,166
before visiting hours end
for the day... Well, see ya.

442
00:23:35,208 --> 00:23:37,125
It's finally time for us, Mayu!

443
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:38,750
That's right, Ayu.

444
00:23:42,708 --> 00:23:44,916
Ayu, are you all right?
Don't die on stage!

445
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,333
Oh, this is nothing!

446
00:23:46,416 --> 00:23:47,958
Besides if I died, we
wouldn't have much of a show.

447
00:23:48,041 --> 00:23:49,916
Preach the word, sister!

448
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:52,583
Yeah, yeah!

449
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:54,666
No!

450
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:55,958
I'm ok...

451
00:23:56,041 --> 00:23:58,416
Now let's show them
just how wonderful we are.

452
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,416
Right on!

453
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,791
Let's start with...

454
00:24:00,875 --> 00:24:01,750
Wait!
