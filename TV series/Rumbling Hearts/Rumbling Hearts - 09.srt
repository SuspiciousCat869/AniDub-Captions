1
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,833
Man, it's pouring again.

2
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:06,041
It seems like it's
never gonna stop.

3
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:16,791
You spend more time with
her than you do with me.

4
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:18,958
All we ever do
is sleep together...

5
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:23,458
Takayuki...? Takayuki?

6
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:25,833
What's wrong?

7
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:29,750
Is there something
bothering you?

8
00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:33,250
Oh. The doctor
said real books'd be

9
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:34,708
too much for me...

10
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:36,208
Can you believe that...?

11
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:39,041
She said that all the big
words would just tire me out...

12
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:41,625
So mom bought these
for me to pass the time.

13
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:43,250
Well that was nice of her...

14
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:46,916
But... I thought children's
books were your favorite.

15
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,791
They are, but mom can't
find my very favorite.

16
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:52,583
She's looked everywhere.

17
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:54,750
Oh really... Which one's that?

18
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:58,000
The one that you
loved--Mayal's Gift?

19
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:03,833
Oh, right. How could I forget?

20
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:06,291
Well... mom can't
find it anywhere.

21
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:09,291
Maybe I should
try looking for it.

22
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:10,166
It's worth a shot.

23
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,125
Really?

24
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:12,041
Of course...

25
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,708
I would do anything for you.

26
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:16,375
That's awesome. Thank you.

27
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:25,458
Oh, thank you.

You're back. I was worried.

38
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:09,291
It must be raining
pretty hard out there.

39
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:11,916
Um, if you're hungry...

40
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,666
I could heat the dinner I made.

41
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,708
It's really nothing fancy...

42
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:19,416
Just some noodles and stuff,

43
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,458
but it should warm
you up a little.

44
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,916
I'm sorry I called you
at work like that...

45
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,791
Sometimes a girl just needs
to hear her man's voice...

46
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:30,041
I was just feeling
a little lonely I guess.

47
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:31,375
It's fine.

48
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:33,791
I'm gonna jump in
the shower for a minute.

49
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,416
After walking in that cold
rain, I wouldn't blame you.

50
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,125
I put some fresh
towels in the cabinet...

51
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:40,333
You want me to heat up the
food while you're in there?

52
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:42,291
Don't worry about it.

53
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:43,250
Come on...

54
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:44,708
It's just that you're supposed

55
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:47,041
to get up early tomorrow,
so you should go to bed now.

56
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:44,875
Here it is!

57
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:48,208
This is it...

58
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:50,583
but it's just so beat up
and ragged looking.

59
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:07,166
Pardon me.

60
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,041
I heard a crash! Are you okay?

61
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:11,833
Yeah, thanks, Mayu...

62
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:14,166
I just kinda... I klutzed out.

63
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:16,916
There's blood on your hand!

64
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,833
What?

65
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:19,625
Bandage, we need
a bandage, STAT!

66
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:22,375
Oh, it's just a little cut.

67
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:23,375
I'll help you!

68
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:25,416
I'll be right back
with assistance!

69
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:30,500
Get up slacker.

70
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:31,666
Why can't you do your job

71
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,875
without causing so
many problems for us?

72
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:35,041
You're right, Ayu...

73
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:36,375
You don't have to
worry about a thing...

74
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:38,208
I'll clean up the mess myself.

75
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,541
Duh... What did you think...?

76
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,875
That I was gonna help you
clean your mess up...?

77
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:44,750
Besides if you haven't noticed,
I'm on my lunch break.

78
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:46,250
Good for you.

79
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:49,541
You know...

80
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:50,666
You'd better get your
head out of the clouds.

81
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,666
You have too much
work this afternoon.

82
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:53,666
Excuse me.

83
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:56,166
Yes, ma'am?!

84
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,708
With these stupid customers,

85
00:07:57,791 --> 00:07:59,583
I'll never get to
my stupid lunch.

86
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:01,416
Don't worry about it.

87
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,458
I'll take care of your
customer once I'm done...

88
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:06,291
Go ahead and eat
your lunch, okay.

89
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:07,625
What did you say?!

90
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:08,875
For whatever reason,

91
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:10,625
we've been slammed
since breakfast...

92
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:13,500
You've earned your break,
now go take it.

93
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:16,583
Could I get some
service, please?

94
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:18,375
I'll be right with you.

95
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:25,166
Mayu is here to save the day...

96
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:26,833
here's your bandage...

97
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:29,041
Hey, Ayu... Where's uh...

98
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:30,666
Where did Takayuki run off to?

99
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:31,791
He needs my help.

100
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:34,291
Shrimp scampi...
and a bottled water.

101
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,041
We'll make the delivery date

102
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:42,000
to your store the
fifteenth of next month.

103
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:44,041
Sounds like I made a good deal.

104
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:45,208
Thank you so much.

105
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,041
I look forward
to working with you.

106
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,958
Uh, Mitsuki?

107
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:53,416
Oh, yes?

108
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,791
You zoned out again.

109
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:57,166
Yeah, sorry.

110
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:00,416
Have you not been getting
enough sleep these days?

111
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:05,333
Look, if there's anything
you need to talk about...

112
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:06,750
Just know I can
be your friend...

113
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:09,250
as well as your boss, okay?

114
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:19,458
Excuse me for a sec.

115
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:24,666
What...!

116
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,833
Look, just talk to
the damn lawyer, okay!

117
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:30,500
For crying out loud,
you can have the car...

118
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:32,208
No, I don't care.

119
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:33,875
I just want this over with.

120
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:35,416
Sorry, guys.

121
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:37,416
I'm so tired.

122
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,833
It's about time.

123
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:40,958
You know the last one here
has to pay for everybody.

124
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:43,458
That's not fair.

125
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:55,791
Where'd she go?

126
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:08,708
You guys remember the time
when Takayuki fell off the--

127
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:11,000
Oh, please, let's not
bring that up again.

128
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:21,333
I want those days...
to come back.

129
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:28,166
Yo, what's up?

130
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:30,583
Hi, Shinji?

131
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:31,416
Hey...

132
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,750
Mitsuki, what's going on...?

133
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:34,125
You get a break from work?

134
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:36,250
I just wanted to
hear your voice.

135
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:39,375
Hey, is there something wrong??

136
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:41,583
No, not really.

137
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:44,083
Did you have a fight
with Takayuki again?

138
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:45,458
I guess you could say that.

139
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:46,875
If you want me to kick his butt,

140
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:49,500
you know I'm always
willing and able for that...

141
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:52,541
Or I could just call him for
you, and try to explain things.

142
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:54,000
No, I don't want that.

143
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:57,708
I just, well,
I don't even know...

144
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,125
Come on, what is it?

145
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:00,625
Nothing.

146
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:02,416
Do you want me to come by?

147
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:08,000
You still there?

148
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:12,958
Yah!

149
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:14,041
Miki, don't do that...

150
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:15,541
You could give me
a heart attack...

151
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:17,041
And I'm too young to die.

152
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:18,375
Yeah, right...

153
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:21,000
Oh, sorry I didn't
see you on the phone.

154
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:24,166
Oh, yeah.

155
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,208
Well I was.

I finished clearing
off table three.

160
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:53,625
It's absolutely spotless...

161
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:55,458
Well, well...

162
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:57,625
I'd say you're a little
behind here, Takayuki.

163
00:11:57,708 --> 00:11:59,375
Yeah, thanks for noticing...

164
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:00,916
Just leave them anywhere.

165
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,958
I'll get to them.

166
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:03,250
I would but there's
no more room...

167
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:05,125
They'd just fall to the ground.

168
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:07,041
Hey, you want me
to help out here?

169
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:08,125
I got some time.

170
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:09,375
Nope, I can manage.

171
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:11,041
 'Kay.

172
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:13,416
What the heck...?!

173
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,166
Where's the dishwasher?

174
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:16,333
Takayuki?

175
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:17,500
Yes, sir?

176
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:18,833
You have a minute?

177
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:20,416
Of course.

178
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,791
I wonder what that's about.

179
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:26,875
He's probably getting fired.

180
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:36,500
Mr. Ito, hi.

181
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:39,083
Hello, Takayuki...
It's nice to see you.

182
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:41,083
Thank you very much, sir.

183
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:45,416
I have something...

184
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,166
I hope you think
it's a fair offer...

185
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,333
But let me know if you don't.

186
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:50,833
What kind of offer?

187
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:54,500
A contract?

188
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:56,916
Yes, for full time...

189
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,333
I'm sure you have a good reason

190
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:00,500
for only working part-time,
but you are valuable.

191
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:02,750
You're a hard worker
and personable.

192
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:05,666
And I promise your work
load won't change too much.

193
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:13,166
Take your time and
consider your options...

194
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,333
Go home; talk it over
with your girlfriend...

195
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:17,916
Then just let us
know what you think.

196
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:20,000
Manager?

197
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:21,375
Yes.

198
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:22,625
You'll be making more money,
which is always good...

199
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:24,333
and you're due for
something like this,

200
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:26,375
at least that's what
your boss tells us.

201
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:27,958
Mr. Ito, please.

202
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:30,666
I'm sorry, did
I blow your cover?

203
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:38,250
Hear anything?
I just hear the door.

204
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:40,500
I wish they'd speak up.

205
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:41,750
They're way too quiet.

206
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:43,916
What do you think
that means, Ayu?

207
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:48,458
They're either rats or thieves.

208
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:51,000
So that means...

209
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:54,916
They're like three
blind mice, but thieves!

210
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,416
What?

211
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:58,583
Oh... What're ya doing?

212
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:00,791
Just minding our own business!

213
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,625
What's up with them?

214
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,750
I don't ever know.

215
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:05,666
It could be anything.

216
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,041
I know we're busy out there...

217
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:08,750
Then I'll get back to work.

218
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:11,166
Do I really have time
to think about this offer...?

219
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,958
I mean, I don't wanna
let it go too long.

220
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:14,041
Yeah.

221
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:15,791
What kind of offer?

222
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:16,958
Do you mind...

223
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:18,708
if I head out just
a little early today...?

224
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:21,291
I need to talk with
Mitsuki about this...

225
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,875
Thanks for covering for me.

226
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:40,625
I'm sorry for
leaving you like I did.

227
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:43,291
Don't worry yourself about it.

228
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:46,500
I understand you have a
lot you're going through...

229
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:48,458
Everyone needs a little break.

230
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:51,250
Thank you.

231
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:00,041
It's Shinji.

232
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:09,583
I'm trying to find a
better copy of this book.

233
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:11,750
I'm sorry. That's
a fairly rare book.

234
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:13,708
We just don't carry
anything like that.

235
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:20,416
I'm gonna have to get
a whole different list

236
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,750
of bookstores to check out.

237
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:31,958
Ayu...

238
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:32,916
We're not even at work.

239
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,583
What do you want from me?

240
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:36,000
What's this about an offer?

241
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:37,875
You were eavesdropping?

242
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:40,708
Yeah, so what?
What about the offer?

243
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:45,083
Hey, I'm talking to you.

244
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:46,125
It's none of your business!

245
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:48,125
Just let it go!

246
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:53,208
 Hey, give that back!

247
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:56,416
What...?

248
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,416
Why'd you buy such
a torn up book...?

249
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,333
You broke?

250
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:00,708
Shut up, Ayu!

251
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:02,416
You don't know!!

252
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,041
Give it back...! You idiot...

253
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,208
Someone very special to me
needs a copy of this book,

254
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:10,375
but I can't give her this one.

255
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:12,041
Now get outta my way!

256
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:15,375
Look! Wait up!

257
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:18,291
I said move!

258
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:19,958
Why can't you give
her the one you have?

259
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:22,333
Because I can't give her a
book that looks like this.

260
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,500
Well, why don't you
just get a new one?

261
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:27,333
I need it to be
older than three years.

262
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:28,625
Three years?

263
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:32,166
Fine... No sweat...
Just let me see the book.

264
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:45,250
Hello, it's me...
I need a favor.

265
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:47,333
Yeah, just a little legwork.

266
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:49,625
Nothing you're not used to.

267
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:54,875
How much longer are
we gonna sit here...?

268
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:56,250
I'm getting kinda bored.

269
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:58,500
I thought this was important.

270
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:02,500
Now, about the offer...

271
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:03,958
Yeah? What about it?

272
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,708
Is it for a permanent position?

273
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:08,541
Are you gonna take it?

274
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:11,708
I guess I need to figure out
a few things before I decide.

275
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:19,000
I don't know yet.

276
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,375
I see.

277
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:24,166
I apologize for the delay.

278
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,458
I knew you'd be here...

279
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:26,666
Did you find it?

280
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:30,083
It wasn't easy, but here it is.

281
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:33,708
It was published four years ago.

282
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:35,416
Will this do?

283
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:39,375
Keep in touch, I'll be around.

284
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:40,958
Definitely.

285
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,125
I'm outta here.

286
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:48,791
Ayu, wait! Hold on!

287
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:50,250
What is it now?

288
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:51,750
I owe you for this.

289
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:55,166
No you don't.
Just take it. It's yours.

290
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:57,500
I just want the
normal Takayuki back

291
00:18:57,583 --> 00:18:59,916
at work tomorrow...
Can you do that?

292
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:02,291
Thanks!

293
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:04,500
Yeah, whatever.

294
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:21,791
I heard that you
came by last night.

295
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,875
I'm really glad that you did...

296
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:27,833
I was worried that you might
have stopped coming to see her.

297
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,875
Oh, I'd never stop that.

298
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:33,708
Hey, are you okay?

299
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:35,083
Yeah, I'm fine.

300
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:36,958
I just caught a little cold.

301
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:38,625
Hey, what's that?

302
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:40,583
It's a book for Haruka.

303
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:42,000
Is that Mayal's Gift...?

304
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:43,875
The one she's been looking for.

305
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:45,041
The very one.

306
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:46,750
I got my hands on a rare copy.

307
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:47,958
She'll be thrilled.

308
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:50,416
That's just what I'm hoping for.

309
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:52,666
Thank you, Takayuki.

310
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,500
Huh? What?

311
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:58,958
Well, I'll see ya
here next time, I guess.

312
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:00,125
Take care.

313
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:01,833
You too.

314
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:05,500
Well, look who's here.

315
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:07,500
Oh, hello.

316
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:09,166
You working by yourself tonight?

317
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,958
Yeah, Hotaru's
taking the night off...

318
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:14,625
so I guess I'm
flying solo tonight.

319
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:16,041
I see...

320
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:22,958
This is... This is
how it should be.

321
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:32,166
I think... you've had
a little too much.

322
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:36,625
Come on...
I know my limits, Shinji.

323
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:44,500
We can never go back.

324
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:49,041
The old days... they were fun.

325
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:52,208
But they're all gone now...

326
00:20:52,291 --> 00:21:01,000
The good times...
They're all gone. It's over.

327
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,875
It's not over yet...

328
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:10,000
We can still have fun now.

329
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:16,500
I love him... I really do.

330
