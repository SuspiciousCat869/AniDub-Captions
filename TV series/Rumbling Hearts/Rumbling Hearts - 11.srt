1
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:52,708
You're right, Haruka.

2
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:54,291
This is a lie. Every bit of it.

3
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:58,166
It's been a little
over three years now...

4
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,041
Nobody told you that you've been

5
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:01,750
in a coma since the
day of the accident.

6
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:04,833
Everyone is determined
to keep the truth from you.

7
00:03:04,916 --> 00:03:07,208
Everyone has been lying
to you from the beginning.

8
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:08,750
If you hadn't been at
the train station that day...

9
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:12,291
everything would
have been fine...

10
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:13,833
Everyone's hurting--

11
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,416
Sorry, Akane...

12
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,666
This is... this is all my fault

13
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,625
What are you doing?

14
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:17,083
It keeps falling off of here.

15
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,041
The sucker just won't stay on.

16
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:34,125
Listen, Mitsuki...

17
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:49,083
Here, let me help you.

18
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:25,000
Takayuki.

19
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:31,375
I'm so sorry...

20
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:33,666
I was standing right there,
but I just couldn't help.

21
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,000
We heard what happened.

22
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:36,583
It's not your fault.

23
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:37,666
Actually, we're the ones

24
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,083
that should be
apologizing to you...

25
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:42,041
We should never have put this

26
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:44,291
responsibility on your
shoulders, Takayuki.

27
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:47,000
No really... I, uh...

28
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:51,458
Takayuki, do you know
where Akane went?

29
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:58,958
I think I saw her
leave through that door.

30
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:00,250
Thank you.

31
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:19,708
Now where would you go...

32
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:21,250
I wonder...

33
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:49,750
Hey, it's Takayuki.

34
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:51,916
Has Akane shown back up yet?

35
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:55,916
Ok, then I'll keep looking...

36
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,208
No, no. It's no trouble at all.

37
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:06,125
Why?

38
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:08,125
Why did you show up, Shinji?

39
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:10,208
Why'd you have to
try to play hero?

40
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,791
I...

41
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:15,166
Why didn't you just ignore me

42
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,500
and keep on going
with your perfect life?

43
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:18,875
Mitsuki, I just...

44
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:21,000
I couldn't let you go in
there with some stranger...

45
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,208
I wanted to protect you.

46
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:24,625
I get that, Shinji.

47
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:27,000
But I didn't want
this to be with you.

48
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:32,125
I don't understand...

49
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:35,166
Why...? Why did
it have to be you?

50
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,625
Why didn't...

51
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:39,916
Why'd you have to stop me?

52
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,791
Was it that you pitied me?

53
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,125
It isn't like that at all.

54
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:51,750
Did I seem...
that pathetic to you?

55
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:55,875
Well maybe I am...

56
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:59,000
I have nothing left...

57
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:01,625
was I not supposed
to love him...

58
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,166
Was it really
such a bad thing...?

59
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:08,250
Was giving up on swimming
for him so terrible?

60
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:12,083
Was keeping it from
Haruka so bad...?

61
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:14,500
Am I that terrible
of a person...?

62
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:17,708
Does everything I do
have to hurt someone?

63
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:32,458
Will you tell
Takayuki what happened?

64
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:37,208
I don't think I can face him.

65
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,208
Yes?

66
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:47,791
Sure, I'll let him know
right away, no prob.

67
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:50,041
Mayu, who was that?

68
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:51,958
Oh, it was Takayuki.

69
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:53,458
He said his cold has
gotten a lot worse,

70
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:55,375
so he won't be coming
in to work today.

71
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:57,250
What...?! Sick my ass!

72
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:59,708
He's just a lazy,
freaking no good loser!

73
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:01,000
I bet he just wanted

74
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:03,625
to take a few days
off to play hooky.

75
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,500
There appears to be no
indication of brain damage.

76
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:09,875
She isn't in a coma but,

77
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:11,375
it seems that the
psychological shock threw

78
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:14,250
her brain into a kind
of self-protection mode.

79
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:16,458
However, this is
a very rare type

80
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:19,166
of illness and there is no
information on the subject.

81
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,791
So basically my
analysis is guesswork.

82
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:23,500
All we can do right now is try

83
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:27,000
to protect her from any
more outside stimulation.

84
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:28,708
Other than that,
we can all make sure

85
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:30,833
to be there for her
when she wakes up.

86
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:36,125
Thank you so much
for your help, Doctor.

87
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:40,416
Doc, how is Haruka?

88
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,041
Are you all right?

89
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:47,250
I'm ok... I think
I'm over the worst part.

90
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:49,333
You need rest...

91
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:51,875
That's my professional opinion.

92
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:54,666
I'm sorry for causing
you so much grief.

93
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,166
Go home and rest...

94
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,875
If the situation changes,
we'll let you know first thing.

95
00:10:58,958 --> 00:10:59,916
I promise.

96
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,666
Uh, but I--

97
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:01,708
No buts.

98
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:03,458
I know you're
worried about Akane,

99
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:05,583
but she's a big girl now.

100
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:08,166
I'm sure she'll be all
right when we find her.

101
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:11,458
Okay.

102
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:52,833
Takayuki?

103
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:58,083
Akane.

104
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:04,916
I'm sorry if I made you worry.

105
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Yeah, don't sweat it...

106
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:09,041
I'm just glad you're okay.

107
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:11,250
How is my sister doing?

108
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:14,000
She's... in Intensive Care.

109
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:15,291
Oh.

110
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:18,375
I just can't believe it!

111
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:23,208
After three years, she
finally wakes up, and I...

112
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:27,500
Oh, Takayuki, what if
she never wakes up again?

113
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:30,083
She'll be ok.

114
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:32,166
It's all my fault.

115
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,958
Because I... Because I kept...

116
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:37,833
I kept lying to her.
It's all my fault.

117
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:39,000
We all lied...

118
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:40,791
That's what they
told us to do...

119
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:43,166
It's not your fault
that they said that.

120
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:46,333
No... I betrayed her, Takayuki!

121
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:48,791
I said horrible things.

122
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:50,500
I told her about
you and Mitsuki.

123
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:53,625
I blamed Mitsuki and
I even blamed my sister.

124
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:54,875
How is she to blame?

125
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:56,458
What did she do wrong?

126
00:12:58,291 --> 00:13:00,375
I'm a horrible sister.

127
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,166
No, Akane...

128
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:09,541
Haruka's in the hospital,
because of me...

129
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,166
I was supposed to meet her

130
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,625
at the station that
day but I was late...

131
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:20,416
If I'd been on time,
things would be fine now.

132
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,291
Haruka, would never have been

133
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:23,791
in that horrible accident...

134
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,208
No one would be
hurting right now,

135
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:31,208
if I had just managed
to get there sooner...

136
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:35,500
Everything would have
stayed just like it was.

137
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:39,791
So, you see, it's all my fault.

138
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:41,958
Not anyone else's...

139
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:46,333
I never wanted to
hurt anyone. But I did.

140
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:47,708
Takayuki...

141
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:50,583
I managed to destroy it all.

142
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:52,041
I never wanted any of this

143
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:55,916
and still I betrayed Haruka
and I devastated Mitsuki.

144
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,500
I even managed to hurt you.

145
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,125
Are you alright?

146
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:06,541
I'm fine.

147
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:09,958
Really, I'm ok. Thank you.

148
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:13,208
Don't worry about your sis...

149
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:15,833
I had a talk with Doctor
Kozuki about her earlier...

150
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:18,583
She's gonna recover someday...

151
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:21,083
I know in my
heart that she will.

152
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,958
Thank you. That's sweet.

153
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,666
It still really hurts me...

154
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,333
how nice you always are.

155
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:45,750
I did my best to
watch over my sister.

156
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:47,750
But it wasn't just for her...

157
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:49,916
It was for you, too.

158
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:55,041
I thought that if
she ever woke up ...

159
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:58,166
it would make you happy
and I wanted to see that...

160
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:01,375
then you'd come back...

161
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:03,458
You would come to see
her like you always did.

162
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:07,125
And you would be there
for her when she needed you.

163
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:11,416
But now...

164
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,583
Now I just feel sorry for her.

165
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:23,416
Well...

166
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,875
I have to go now...

167
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:29,083
I owe my parents an explanation
for where I've been...

168
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:31,958
And I... should try to make up

169
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:35,166
for all the trouble
that I've caused.

170
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:38,333
I'm gonna stay by sis's side

171
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:39,791
and watch over her...

172
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:41,750
But I'm not gonna do
it for anyone else.

173
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:43,541
I don't think that's my place.

174
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:47,666
I'll be the one
who's there for her.

175
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:58,708
Thank you for everything.

176
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,333
Sorry for taking so long.

177
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:29,833
Here you go.

178
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:35,208
Come on, they're not
that bad, are they...?

179
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:38,333
Yeah, I know they're cheap,
but it's the best I could do.

180
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:40,875
Besides, you can't
walk on a broken heel.

181
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:54,708
Wait.

182
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:56,333
Mitsuki, where are you going?

183
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:59,458
To work.

184
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:01,375
But it's already
so late in the day...

185
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:04,125
you should just take
the rest of it off...

186
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:09,208
Hey! Wait! Hold up!

187
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:15,875
Are you all right?

188
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,125
I'm sorry for everything ...

189
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:25,916
I really am.

190
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:56,000
I wonder what happened to her.

191
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:01,500
Stop calling. She's not here.

192
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:08,291
Hello, Takayuki.

193
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:14,125
Thank you for coming to
see me on such short notice.

194
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:16,166
Really, it's no problem at all.

195
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:19,791
Here's Mitsuki's bag; she
hasn't been in to pick it up.

196
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:21,125
Thank you.

197
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:24,416
It sounds like
you've got a cold.

198
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,708
Uh, I'm getting better.

199
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:27,666
Just been a little
under the weather...

200
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,708
This cold is
getting passed around

201
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:31,333
like its currency or something.

202
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:32,666
So, I hear...

203
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,291
Well, when you do see Mitsuki,

204
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:35,416
would you please tell her

205
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,083
to give me a call
here at the office?

206
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:38,583
Of course.

207
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:40,500
Takayuki, it may be
none of my business...

208
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:41,833
but you really
need to talk to her.

209
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:44,250
And listen to
what she has to say.

210
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,541
I can't afford for
her personal life

211
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,958
to continue interrupting
my work life.

212
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:51,791
Yes, ma'am.

213
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:54,916
The train is arriving
on platform three.

214
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,916
For your safety,
please remain standing

215
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,333
behind the yellow line
until the train

216
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:01,291
has come to a complete stop.

217
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,875
Well, look who's here.

218
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:23,916
I'm sorry.

219
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,125
Do you realize that I had
to stay late thanks to you?

220
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:28,166
I guess I don't mind that much,

221
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:29,250
considering going home early

222
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:31,333
is not a priority
for me these days.

223
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:32,791
Let me help you finish.

224
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:34,666
Takayuki came by today.

225
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:37,250
I didn't know when
I was going to see you,

226
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:38,583
so I gave him your bag.

227
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:40,208
Oh, thank you.

228
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:42,333
You should hurry
and get home to him...

229
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:43,583
If I were you,

230
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:45,750
I would just forget
about work for today.

231
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:48,750
Oh, you didn't know
he was sick, did you...?

232
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:51,166
He looked like he
was about to collapse.

233
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:23,291
Takayuki...!

234
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:24,916
What are you doing
just sitting there?

235
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,583
Class is about to
start...! Come on!

236
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:44,041
Mitsuki...

237
00:21:59,208 --> 00:22:00,708
Takayuki!

238
00:23:32,333 --> 00:23:33,916
This idiot Takayuki
with his problems,

239
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,625
he belongs on trash TV...

240
00:23:35,708 --> 00:23:37,750
Huh...? Who is that?

241
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,541
It's not your
fault they said that.

242
00:23:40,625 --> 00:23:42,666
What was that?!

243
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,541
I...

244
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:47,166
It's not your fault
they said that--

245
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:47,833
Ayu!

246
00:23:47,916 --> 00:23:49,083
Oh, no, Mayu!
