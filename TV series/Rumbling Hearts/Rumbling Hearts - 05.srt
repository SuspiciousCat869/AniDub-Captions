1
00:01:51,416 --> 00:01:53,291
You guys make me sick.

2
00:01:53,375 --> 00:01:55,375
You ignore my sister
for three entire years

3
00:01:55,458 --> 00:01:57,208
when she was in a coma,
and the whole time

4
00:01:57,291 --> 00:01:59,875
you were hooking up with
each other behind her back!

5
00:01:59,958 --> 00:02:02,083
Tell me... Aren't you
ashamed of yourself...?

6
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:04,250
Do you feel any guilt at all?

7
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:05,875
My sister needs you now.

8
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:07,791
She wants you to be by her side.

9
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:11,375
Yet you just stand there with
that stupid look on your face.

10
00:02:11,458 --> 00:02:14,500
You're nothing but a coward!

11
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:20,041
You know I'm glad.

12
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:21,000
Huh?

13
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:22,708
Even though the situation sucks,

14
00:02:22,791 --> 00:02:25,458
I'm glad Haruka
came out of her coma.

15
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:27,250
Yeah.

16
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:36,708
Wow. It's really
pouring out there, huh?

17
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:00,083
That was pathetic!

18
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:01,958
I've seen kids in junior high

19
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:03,625
swim faster laps
than you just did!

20
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:06,291
Did you not learn anything
over the last three years?

21
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:09,500
Well you can kiss that corporate
sponsorship goodbye now.

22
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:10,708
There's no way they'll want

23
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:13,375
to sign a fifth place
finisher to a deal.

24
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:15,583
The real world doesn't
work that easily.

25
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:16,875
You're not going to have a coach

26
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:18,166
to hold your hand through life

27
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,875
once you leave this school.

28
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:21,041
If you're not willing to give

29
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:23,375
a hundred and ten
percent then move over

30
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:24,875
so someone else can!

Takayuki! You home?

36
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:06,583
Come on...

37
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:08,458
He forgot to lock
the door again.

38
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:12,375
Wake up.

39
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:15,000
You need to get some sun
or you'll turn moldy.

40
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:16,916
I'm guessing you
didn't eat breakfast.

41
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,375
You know, it's a
good thing you have me,

42
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:21,125
'cause I brought you some food.

43
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,333
I've got to head back to work.

44
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:30,250
Don't forget to lock up
if you go somewhere, okay.

45
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,208
Oh no...
I'm gonna be late again.

46
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:41,166
That's all I need.

47
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,541
What's up...? You need
a lift, hot stuff?

48
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:46,041
Shinji! You have perfect timing!

49
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:48,583
I'm so glad you saw me.

50
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:51,125
My lunch hour is over in a few
minutes and I can't be late.

51
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,541
So hurry!

52
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,250
I'm surprised you're
not kissing up

53
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:55,750
to your boss and
eating at your desk.

54
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:57,125
What are you
doing driving around?

55
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:58,333
I thought you
had school today...

56
00:04:58,416 --> 00:04:59,791
Or are you flunking out again?

57
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:01,291
Don't you wish.

58
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:06,708
So can I assume that you were

59
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:08,500
walking back from
Takayuki's place?

60
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:11,750
Uh, yeah.

61
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:13,791
If I were you
I'd leave him alone.

62
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:15,125
Why?

63
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:17,708
What's it been,
a whole year since that day?

64
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:18,916
If you keep babying him

65
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,041
he's never going
to snap out of it.

66
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:23,083
I know Takayuki
well enough to know

67
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:26,458
that sometimes it's just better
to let him handle it on his own.

68
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:27,875
I don't agree with that.

69
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:29,375
Look, he's not a kid anymore.

70
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:30,833
Just let him deal with it.

71
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:34,250
Besides, Haruka's accident
was just that--an accident.

72
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:37,208
It wasn't your fault, Mitsuki.

73
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:41,708
Yes it was.

74
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:43,291
Huh?

75
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:56,416
Thanks for the ride.
You really saved my butt.

76
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,750
Don't work too hard.

77
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:58,750
Yeah...

78
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:00,208
I wish I could say
the same to you,

79
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:01,916
but knowing your work ethic
you'd be expelled by now.

80
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,375
Ah, shut up!

81
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:06,166
See ya!

82
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:24,458
I'll see you tomorrow.

83
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:25,875
Good night.

84
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:28,958
Now...

85
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:30,125
What amazing dish am
I gonna cook up tonight?

86
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:32,208
Hey, Mitsuki!

87
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:36,000
Akane?

88
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:40,125
So how's school going?

89
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:41,791
Good, great actually...

90
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:43,666
and swimming is going well, too.

91
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,750
I'm becoming one of
the fastest on the team.

92
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:48,541
Really? That's awesome.

93
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:49,875
How's the rest of the team?

94
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:53,791
Fine... but, I'm
a little disappointed.

95
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:55,458
I never knew the
coaches could be

96
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:58,000
so overtly cruel
to us, it's getting old.

97
00:06:58,083 --> 00:06:59,083
Yeah well...

98
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:00,416
they may be tough, but it seems

99
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,333
to bring the best
performances out of everyone.

100
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:03,125
Y'know?

101
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:04,125
No!

102
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:05,416
Listen...

103
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,958
They criticized you,
and right in front of me.

104
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:10,500
They said you don't have
a career in swimming now

105
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:13,750
because you lost your
edge chasing after a boy...

106
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:16,458
None of them...

107
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:19,625
None of them understand.
They just don't get it.

108
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:23,625
Akane.

109
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,833
Thank you for
everything, Mitsuki.

110
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:28,333
Huh?

111
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:30,958
You've been so incredibly
gracious helping with Takayuki.

112
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:33,208
Oh it's nothing...
I don't mind...

113
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:35,875
Takayuki's my friend
so I like helping him...

114
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:39,041
He's been in pretty bad shape,
but I would be, too...

115
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:42,250
I bet in no time he'll be back
on his feet and feeling better.

116
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:45,958
Mistuki.

117
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:47,625
I'm just so happy you're willing

118
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:50,291
to help my sister and
Takayuki through this.

119
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:51,875
I know she'll...

120
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:55,500
I know she'll wake up
one day and be so happy...

121
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:57,500
Thank you.

122
00:07:57,583 --> 00:07:59,500
You're so nice.

123
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:01,125
It's okay.

124
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:12,875
Um, Mitsuki, would it be alright
if I asked you for a favor?

125
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:13,958
Of course.

126
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:15,041
Well I have a videotape

127
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:16,875
of me swimming a
few laps of freestyle...

128
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:18,416
Would you mind
taking a look at it

129
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,583
and judging me on my form...?

130
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,416
I'm not very good
at criticizing myself.

131
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,041
Sure I will...

132
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:24,791
Though I'm not sure
how much help I'll be.

133
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:27,833
Awesome! Thank you so much!

134
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:28,958
Here you go.

135
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:36,666
Come on...

136
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,916
How many times
do I have to remind him

137
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,041
to lock the door if he
leaves the apartment?

138
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:42,083
Geez, what a pigsty.

139
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,708
Perfect.

140
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:18,708
Better change that bulb.

141
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,541
Mitsuki.

142
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,458
Oh, hold on a second.

143
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:02,791
I have some soup
I can heat up for you.

144
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:13,750
Takayuki. Let's go do
something fun tomorrow.

145
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:16,750
I think it would
do you some good

146
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:19,250
to get out of this musty
apartment for the day.

147
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,458
Okay.

148
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:27,666
Huh?

149
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:38,791
Let's do it.

150
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:41,291
Oh wow. You've gotta
see this, Takayuki.

151
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:42,833
It's gorgeous!

152
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:44,416
I find it amazing they can put

153
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,125
so many different types of fish
in one tank at the same time.

154
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:48,125
Don't you...?

155
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:49,250
Wouldn't you think
all the big fish

156
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:50,666
would start eating
the little ones?

157
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:51,875
I don't know.

158
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:52,583
Look...

159
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:54,208
I paid for your ticket,

160
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:56,416
so the least you can do is act
like you're having fun, okay?

161
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:11,708
I'm gonna keep walking.

162
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:14,375
Huh...? Oh, cool.

163
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:25,750
Hey...

164
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:29,250
Uh, what're you doing...?
Would ya let go?

165
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:31,291
What's wrong?

166
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:40,708
Oh cool!

167
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:42,500
Check out those cups!

168
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:44,416
Don't you think they're cute?

169
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,708
Not really.

170
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,958
Here, buy 'em for me.

171
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:47,833
What?

172
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,166
Well, come on...

173
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,083
I paid for your ticket;
I'm always cooking for ya.

174
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:53,666
Well?

175
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:55,791
Fine.

176
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:58,000
I'll take these.

177
00:11:58,083 --> 00:11:58,916
Great.

178
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,916
Alright!

179
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:13,916
It feels good to get out.

180
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:20,666
Thanks... I had a lot of fun.

181
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:24,208
Sure.

182
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:26,333
You wanna grab a
cup of coffee with me?

183
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:27,583
No, thanks.

184
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:29,208
I think I'm just gonna
walk around a bit more.

185
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:31,458
There's a book I wanna find.

186
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:34,750
Oh okay... I'll call you later.

187
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:36,583
Sounds good.

188
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:46,541
I don't believe it.

189
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:48,541
They're holding another exhibit.

190
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,250
Hi, this is Takayuki.

191
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,875
I'm out right now or
I'm asleep or I'm busy.

192
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:16,583
At any rate, I can't
reach the phone.

193
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:18,875
Leave a message after the
beep and I'll call you back.

194
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:21,583
Hey, Takayuki it's me.

195
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:23,125
I guess you're not home yet.

196
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:26,083
If it's alright with you, I'm
just gonna leave this mug...

197
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:28,666
you know the one you
bought me, at your apartment.

198
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:32,875
So, I'm gonna come over.
I'll see ya then.

199
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,041
Takayuki?

200
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:51,916
No, he's not here with us.

201
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,291
Why, what's up?

202
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:55,125
Oh nothing.

203
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:56,583
I'm sure he's fine.

204
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:59,083
He doesn't have a cell phone
so I thought I'd try you.

205
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,791
You should have seen him today.

206
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:03,250
He was in great spirits.

207
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:04,791
That's good to hear.

208
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:06,833
Look, I gotta run, but I'll
let you know if he calls, okay?

209
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:08,500
Thanks.

210
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,791
Haruka.

211
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:46,458
Haruka. I saw a poster today

212
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:49,083
for another children's book
exhibit coming up.

213
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:51,916
Remember? Mayal's Gift?

214
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,791
The author's going to be there.

215
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:57,000
You want to go right?
It'll be fun.

216
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,125
What?

217
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:01,708
You better believe it.

218
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:06,833
Of course.

219
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:09,041
Don't worry.
We're not gonna miss it again.

220
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:12,000
I promise...
I'll even rent us a car.

221
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,125
Yes.

222
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,333
No, I haven't seen
Takayuki here all day.

223
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:21,791
Thanks anyway.

224
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:23,375
Visiting hours are over

225
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:26,125
so if he's coming here
it'll be tomorrow.

226
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:27,000
Is it urgent?

227
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:29,583
Oh, no... Just forget it.

228
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:32,041
Sir, you can't do this!

229
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:33,666
Put her down! Quick!

230
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:34,750
Someone call security!

231
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,125
Get out of our way!

232
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:37,791
I don't think you understand
how dangerous this is!

233
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:39,750
We have to leave now
before it's over!

234
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:41,625
We can't miss it! Come on move!

235
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:44,125
Please! She's only asking
for this one thing!

236
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:45,208
Move!

237
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:46,375
Takayuki!

238
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:47,708
I made a promise to her!

239
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:49,083
You can't make me break it!

240
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:50,208
Move!

241
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,708
Get a hold of yourself!

242
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:54,333
Even if you take her there,

243
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:56,791
it's not like she'll be
able to see anything.

244
00:15:56,875 --> 00:15:58,500
You of all people
should know that.

245
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:00,166
She's in a coma!

246
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:25,958
Haruka.

247
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:27,625
I feel so bad for
you being stuck

248
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:30,375
in this awful hospital
bed all the time.

249
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:32,458
It's not fair to you.

250
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:36,250
And it's so hard for Takayuki
to have to see you like this.

251
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:38,958
Why did it have to happen?

252
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:42,250
Why? If I could go back
to that day, I would...

253
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:45,500
I would put myself
in your place...

254
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:47,208
I really would.

255
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:06,375
Takayuki.

256
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:08,416
We understand that
you care for our daughter,

257
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,041
Haruka, very much,

258
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:12,541
and we appreciate the
time you spent with her.

259
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:14,833
And I know she
appreciates it as well.

260
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:17,333
And that's why
I'm sorry to say...

261
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:19,375
Please forgive us...

262
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:22,500
but we don't want you to
visit our daughter any longer.

263
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,375
I'm sorry, son...

264
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:26,333
but we're doing this
for your own sake.

265
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:30,708
Please. You can say
goodbye to Haruka,

266
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:33,083
but you're not
welcome here anymore.

267
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,875
You're gonna catch a cold.

268
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:00,958
Come on...

269
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:02,750
Snap out of it already.

270
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,750
I understand how you feel...

271
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:09,958
I know it's hard...
It is for me too.

272
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:11,833
But there's nothing...

273
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:15,791
There's nothing
you can do about it.

274
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:18,541
No matter how much
you feel for her,

275
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:21,875
the fact is she can't return
those feelings to you now.

276
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:23,666
It's useless to dwell on it...

277
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:24,833
Takayuki.

278
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:26,166
Are you even listening?

279
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:29,083
Ugh! Why won't you say anything?

280
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:30,541
What, are you dead inside?!

281
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:32,375
I just want you
to acknowledge me!

282
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:33,916
Say something!

283
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:37,833
Wake up!

284
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:49,625
I love you...

285
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:52,875
And I've...
I've always loved you.

286
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:55,041
And I tried to ignore
it all these years...

287
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:59,041
I tried so hard to bury the
feelings that I had for you.

288
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:04,500
Because I didn't...
mean to betray Haruka!

289
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:11,083
But, I can't stand it ...

290
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:13,083
I hate seeing you like this...

291
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:14,500
what you're doing to yourself...

292
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:16,833
what I'm doing to myself...

293
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:20,333
Do you... love me?

294
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:07,166
Good afternoon.

295
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:15,083
It's so blue.

296
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:21,041
Mitsuki.

297
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:23,208
I decided to skip work today...

298
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:26,333
You look hungry.
Let me make you something.

299
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:36,333
Oh, thanks.

300
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:38,791
I wonder what ever
happened to Takayuki.

301
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,375
I'll see you when you get back.

302
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:48,791
Okay.

303
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,375
Maybe he got the
flu or something.

304
00:20:57,791 --> 00:20:59,208
Might as well find out.

305
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:04,708
Anyone home...? Hello?

306
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:10,000
It looks like
Mitsuki's here, too.

307
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:31,166
You... You've been lying
to me this entire time.

308
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,666
Akane.

309
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:45,791
Look, Honey... The rain stopped.

310
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,958
Space, it is a frontier.
And it is the last one.

311
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:39,166
Stop it...!
Your hands smell funny!

312
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:40,625
I don't like all
this space stuff!

313
00:23:40,708 --> 00:23:42,375
What if a scary alien appears!

314
00:23:42,458 --> 00:23:45,083
Fine, then I'll
try something else.

315
00:23:45,166 --> 00:23:46,791
Spaceship Sky Temple

316
00:23:46,875 --> 00:23:48,875
with Captain Ayu
Daikuuji on board...

317
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:51,458
Try again!

318
00:23:51,541 --> 00:23:53,500
Geez! All right.

319
00:23:54,083 --> 00:23:55,500
The future of mankind...

320
00:23:55,583 --> 00:23:56,291
No!

321
00:23:56,375 --> 00:23:57,541
What is your problem?!

322
00:23:57,625 --> 00:23:59,041
Wait, don't press that!

323
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:00,500
Oops.
