1
00:00:20,958 --> 00:00:27,875
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

2
00:00:27,958 --> 00:00:29,625
All right,
Mitsuki, looking good...

3
00:00:29,708 --> 00:00:31,875
That was big improvement
since last week.

4
00:00:31,958 --> 00:00:33,541
Remember this feeling.

5
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:45,375
What's wrong...?

6
00:00:45,458 --> 00:00:47,500
You look so nervous.

7
00:00:51,083 --> 00:00:52,666
Uh... Who are you?

8
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:55,833
Let's see... seven, seven, five,

9
00:00:55,916 --> 00:00:59,000
six, four, three, and five...

10
00:00:59,083 --> 00:01:01,041
You only got a score
of thirty-seven...

11
00:01:01,125 --> 00:01:03,916
Unfortunately for you
that's far from acceptable.

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,666
Whoa, what's far
from acceptable...

13
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,625
and I still don't
know who you are!

14
00:01:08,708 --> 00:01:10,750
I'm so sorry, Takayuki.

15
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:15,500
Is that your sister?

16
00:01:15,583 --> 00:01:17,875
She's kind of a handful.

17
00:01:17,958 --> 00:01:19,208
I'm Akane Suzumiya...

18
00:01:19,291 --> 00:01:21,458
Nice to meet you.
You're cuter than I expected.

19
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:22,958
Oh, thanks.

20
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:25,750
She's not coming
with us today, is she?

21
00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:28,583
No way! She just followed me.

22
00:01:28,666 --> 00:01:31,291
We'll get to be alone...
I think.

23
00:01:31,375 --> 00:01:32,958
Oh, don't worry about me!

24
00:01:33,041 --> 00:01:34,583
Even though it
is summer vacation...

25
00:01:34,666 --> 00:01:36,500
I wouldn't be rude
and tag along...

26
00:01:36,583 --> 00:01:38,916
I'd ruin your hot date.

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,500
It's not... hot...

28
00:01:40,583 --> 00:01:42,791
Oh, would you
please just leave?!

29
00:01:42,875 --> 00:01:44,000
Fine, I'm gone...

30
00:01:44,083 --> 00:01:45,791
I'm gonna check out
the boys at the pool.

31
00:01:45,875 --> 00:01:47,041
Oh, wait--

32
00:01:47,125 --> 00:01:49,875
You go sticking your
hands down her pants,

33
00:01:49,958 --> 00:01:51,083
and you'll have to answer to me.

34
00:01:51,166 --> 00:01:53,083
Got it!

35
00:01:53,166 --> 00:01:54,625
Ha...! I made you
blush like a girl...

36
00:01:54,708 --> 00:01:56,041
He's so innocent!

37
00:01:56,125 --> 00:01:58,666
Have fun, you two!

38
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:01,625
What's wrong with you!

39
00:02:01,708 --> 00:02:04,250
I'm sorry.
She's always like that.

40
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:05,458
What'd she say...?

41
00:02:05,541 --> 00:02:07,250
I hope it wasn't too crass.

42
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:09,500
Oh, no. It was nothing...

43
00:02:10,416 --> 00:02:13,208
Living with her must be a
real pain for you sometimes.

44
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:16,958
More than you could ever know.

45
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:21,041
Your sister's got
a wild attitude.

46
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:23,833
I can't peg why, but she kind
of reminds me of Mitsuki.

47
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:24,916
Makes sense.

48
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,500
She's younger and
less experienced,

49
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:28,541
but Akane's also
on the swim team.

50
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:29,875
That does makes sense.

51
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:31,666
And she usually wins in
the meets she's been to...

52
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,083
She says she wants
to be just like Mitsuki

53
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:35,291
when she gets older.

54
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:37,250
Now, that's a
frightening thought.

55
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,291
Are you all right?

56
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:51,541
Sure, I'm fine.
I was just up late.

57
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:52,791
Did you get any sleep?

58
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:55,000
Some. I borrowed a
video game from Shinji...

59
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:56,166
I was up until dawn.

60
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,541
No wonder you're tired...

61
00:02:57,625 --> 00:02:59,458
You guys and your games...

62
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:05,458
Are you still studying
for your exams?

63
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:07,250
Probably not as
much as I should.

64
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:11,833
I'd love it if you took the
entrance exam for Hakuryo.

65
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:14,208
Koyou University
is too far away.

66
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:16,500
I'm afraid of how
much I'd miss you...

67
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:19,041
Being so far... it'd be hard...

68
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:22,958
It's not too late,
you know... We'd have fun.

69
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:25,833
Yeah, we could walk to
and from school together--

70
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:44,125
I think we missed our stop.

71
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:48,625
Why didn't you wake me up
at the right station?

72
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:49,916
You were fast asleep...

73
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,750
and you looked innocent,
like a baby...

74
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:56,208
I couldn't... You were too
cute to wake up... Sorry.

75
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:57,333
That's okay...

76
00:03:57,416 --> 00:04:00,041
Don't worry
about it... Let's eat.

77
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:01,875
Here.

78
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:02,750
I brought us some really
great food for lunch...

79
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:04,583
Do you want to sit down?

80
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:11,208
Excellent!

81
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:12,625
I was so worried
it would collapse.

82
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:14,083
Hey! A meat pie...!

83
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:15,416
Those are my favorite!

84
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,958
I've heard all about
how much you like them,

85
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:20,000
and I've been practicing
for a while...

86
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:21,416
I think I got it though.

87
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,166
This is the first one
that's come out of the oven

88
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,791
looking the way a meat
pie is supposed to look.

89
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:28,041
And it didn't fall
apart on the way here.

90
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:29,541
I have high hopes,

91
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:32,083
so tell me how it
tastes and be honest.

92
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:33,625
Sure.

93
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:39,291
Well?

94
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:40,750
It's great!

95
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:42,041
Really?

96
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:43,250
Yeah, delicious!

97
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:45,833
I'm so glad.

98
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:48,416
I gotta try...

99
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:51,875
You weren't lying.

100
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,916
This is pretty good.

101
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:05,166
I like this.

102
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,791
Hmm?

103
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,166
This is nice.

104
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:23,750
Yeah... it is.

105
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:36,708
No way!

106
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:38,291
I just couldn't
believe the guy did it.

107
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:39,916
I'm not that surprised.

108
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:47,875
Thanks for walking me back.

109
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:49,000
Do you want to come inside?

110
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:50,916
Uh, well... I kinda...

111
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:55,000
You're just nervous... right?

112
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:57,583
No... it's not like that...

113
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:00,208
Hi, lovers!

114
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:02,458
Akane!

115
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:04,500
I'm starving.

116
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:06,791
Are you two coming inside...

117
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:07,958
Or are you staying out here?

118
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:10,250
Uh... We, uh...

119
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:13,958
Dude... Make up your
mind...! Which is it...?!

120
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:16,375
Three, two, one, answer!

121
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:17,791
Well... it's late...

122
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:19,708
and I wasn't raised that way...

123
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:22,666
It's rude to your parents if
I just drop in unannounced...

124
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:23,833
So I can't--

125
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:26,666
You can keep flapping
your gums inside.

126
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,000
Akane, wait up!

127
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:30,041
Welcome to our humble
abode and excuse any mess.

128
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:32,625
We weren't expecting visitors.

129
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:44,916
Takayuki...

130
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,083
You really need to
learn to relax some.

131
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:48,291
Sure...

132
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:50,416
Now... Just kick back and eat.

133
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,541
We've heard so many good things

134
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:52,916
about you from Haruka...

135
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,375
We're thrilled to
finally meet you.

136
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:56,416
Thanks... Uh...

137
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,416
Thanks... Uh...

138
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:01,083
Stop it...
That's enough, Akane...

139
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:02,375
I'm sorry about that...

140
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:03,833
She doesn't have manners.

141
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:08,250
Now, that that's done, dig in.

142
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:26,041
So... Mr. Big Brother...

143
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:27,291
I wonder...

144
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:29,083
How many dirty thoughts
have crossed your mind?

145
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:30,208
What?!

146
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:32,708
I oughta--

147
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:36,541
Did you call me brother?

148
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:38,291
Yup... Why?

149
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,625
Because...

150
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:42,125
No one's called me that before.

151
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:44,875
I've always wanted to
have myself a big brother...

152
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:46,375
And while you're
not exactly perfect ...

153
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:47,916
I'll put up with you.

154
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,125
Thanks... Great.

155
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:50,666
There's just one thing...

156
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:53,125
You gotta marry Haruka
before you can be my bro.

157
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:57,208
Akane, stop acting
like a freakshow!

158
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:02,291
You two need to
loosen up some...

159
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:03,750
Takayuki...

160
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:04,875
All I want from
you is to be nice

161
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:07,125
to my daughter while
you're dating her.

162
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:10,333
We can worry about
marriage later.

163
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:11,875
Yes, sir!

164
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:17,125
Are your parents cool

165
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:18,458
with you going to
the festival tomorrow?

166
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,916
Yeah, I had my curfew extended.

167
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,875
But I think we'll be alone.

168
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:25,541
Mitsuki said she's
too busy to go with us.

169
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:26,583
Busy?

170
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:27,791
Do you think she
found herself a guy?

171
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:29,791
I think so...

172
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:31,125
At least that's what I hear.

173
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:32,125
Are you serious?

174
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:33,625
Yeah.

175
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:35,500
If she's got a real boyfriend,
that's a first for her...

176
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,625
Hope it works out.

177
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:38,208
I didn't... expect that.

178
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:41,291
Akane saw her in town
walking with some guy.

179
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:42,541
She didn't know who he was,

180
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:44,541
but he was definitely
around her age.

181
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:46,500
Ok... I hope she's happy...

182
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:49,500
Then it'll just be the
two of us tomorrow...

183
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:52,666
But uh... We can leave
Shinji out of it.

184
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:56,041
You can't ditch your
best friend like that.

185
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:58,625
He'll get over it.

186
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:01,083
I'll see you tomorrow.

187
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:12,166
Hi, this is Takayuki.

188
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:15,125
I'm out right now or
I'm asleep or I'm busy.

189
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:16,875
At any rate,
I can't reach the phone.

190
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:19,166
Leave a message after the
beep and I'll call you back.

191
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:51,416
Mitsuki!

192
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:58,000
So were you busy last night

193
00:09:58,083 --> 00:09:59,583
when I tried to call you back?

194
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:00,625
I guess...

195
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:02,125
I don't think I ever
heard the phone.

196
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:03,416
Well, I had three missed calls

197
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,583
from you when I got home.

198
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:07,208
I got worried. What's the deal?

199
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:08,666
Oh, nothing.

200
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:13,416
Fine. I'm lying.

201
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,291
Can we... just talk?

202
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:30,083
Is this drama about
your new boyfriend?

203
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:31,333
I don't have one.

204
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:33,083
I heard you did.

205
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:35,166
No. We were just hanging out.

206
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,125
And then yesterday
he told me he loved me.

207
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:38,541
Which I'm getting used to.

208
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:40,916
But, I still don't
know how to handle.

209
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,291
Are you gonna keep seeing him?

210
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:43,916
Maybe.

211
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,125
So... What do you
think I should do?

212
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:49,041
I guess...

213
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:52,250
if it's someone you're
really into, I'm all for it.

214
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:55,583
Okay...

215
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:58,375
I didn't think you'd say that.

216
00:10:58,458 --> 00:10:59,541
You know, he's
like the tenth guy

217
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:00,875
who's said that to me...

218
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:02,000
And I've walked away

219
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:03,333
from every single
one of them who did.

220
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:05,208
It kinda gets under my skin...

221
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:07,250
But... I guess
I can't blame them.

222
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,708
Wow... cocky.

223
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:10,708
Oh, come on...
You know it's true.

224
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:13,375
I mean, everyone
admires my hair.

225
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:15,208
But I hate it.

226
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:17,875
It's pretty and lush and rich,

227
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:20,916
but it represents the part
of me that I don't want...

228
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,500
The part that's too proud.

229
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:24,125
But this guy didn't like it...

230
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:27,125
He's the only one who's told me
I'd look good with short hair.

231
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:29,583
I don't think
I'll ever forget him.

232
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:33,583
So what...? Do you like him?

233
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:38,458
I don't know... I wish I did.

234
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:40,458
I wish it were an easy decision.

235
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:50,750
That's it... I'm gonna
turn him down.

236
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:52,708
I think it's more important

237
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:56,166
to be true to my feelings,
the way Haruka held out for you.

238
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,875
Sounds good...

239
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:00,125
You gotta stay true to yourself.

240
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:07,166
The festival.

241
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,291
Yeah.

242
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:10,250
But... Haruka?

243
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:11,458
She'll understand...

244
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:13,500
You needed a friend right now.

245
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:16,416
There he is!

246
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,041
Shinji? Haruka?
What are you doing here?

247
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:21,208
Looking for you... jerk!

248
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:22,791
You had a date
with Haruka tonight

249
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,083
and you stood her up!

250
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:26,125
You got some kinda glitch
in your manners?!

251
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:28,041
I found her at the
festival standing alone

252
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:29,458
and crying thanks to you!

253
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:31,166
It's all right, Shinji...

254
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,291
I'm just glad
that he's not hurt.

255
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:34,875
I'm so sorry, Haruka.

256
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:36,958
I didn't know that the
two of you had a date today.

257
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:38,333
I needed to speak with Takayuki

258
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:39,958
so I brought him up here...

259
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:42,708
There's been a lot
on my mind, lately...

260
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:44,208
I'm sorry.

261
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:46,333
It's okay...

262
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:48,083
Whatever.

263
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:49,791
I felt bad about it,

264
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:51,375
but I couldn't
just ignore Mitsuki...

265
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:53,250
She needed to talk to a friend.

266
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:55,875
I don't know what
to say... Haruka.

267
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:57,125
Don't worry about it...

268
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:58,500
You're my best friend.

269
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:00,250
I just hope that when you
feel you need a friend,

270
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:02,500
you know you can
count on me, too.

271
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:06,875
I do know. Thanks, Haruka.

272
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:10,916
Everything's fine.

273
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,291
We all ended up here together,

274
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,625
which is what I wanted
in the first place.

275
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:16,625
It's just perfect...

276
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:19,291
I don't think I ever
wanna be away from you guys.

277
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:20,708
Me, neither...

278
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:22,583
Well, since we're all here,

279
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:24,208
let's go to the
festival together...

280
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:26,125
I've heard it's supposed
to be pretty fun.

281
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:29,125
Sure, but as an apology
I want to pay for everything.

282
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:30,583
Sweet, cause I'm broke...

283
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:32,916
Now what do you say we all
line up for a picture first?

284
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,375
Good idea...

285
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:36,458
I don't think we have any
pictures of the four of us.

286
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:38,208
Exactly. And it's about time.

287
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:40,166
We gotta squeeze tighter.

288
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,291
I'm trying.

289
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:42,708
Hold still.

290
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,333
I'm sorry about today.

291
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:54,833
It's all right.

292
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:57,541
Mitsuki was feeling down,
and you're a good friend to her.

293
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:59,583
I would have
done the same thing.

294
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:00,958
Really?

295
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:02,666
It means a lot to
me that you would

296
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:05,125
take your time to help
my best friend feel better...

297
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:07,625
You're a good person, Takayuki.

298
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:10,291
No lights?

299
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:12,416
Mom and Dad went out
to some business party.

300
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,583
Don't worry.

301
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:15,375
Akane went with them.

302
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:16,958
That's good

303
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:20,000
So, do you wanna come upstairs?

304
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:23,208
I'm enjoying talking to you.

305
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:27,041
Oh... yeah.

306
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:32,708
Hey, nice room.
I like your computer.

307
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:34,375
The place is a mess...

308
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:36,750
Try not to look at
anything too closely.

309
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:38,000
Look at that.

310
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:39,541
You've got a ton
of children's books.

311
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:40,416
You still read them?

312
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,208
Yeah...

313
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:42,583
Cool.

314
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:44,583
When I was a kid
I read Mayal's Gift...

315
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:46,333
But I don't see it up
here on your shelf...

316
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:48,041
Isn't it kinda rare?

317
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:51,833
Well, then we should go find
you a copy of it sometime.

318
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:53,166
I'd like that.

319
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,875
It's my life's dream
to write children's books.

320
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:58,250
That's why I have
to go to college.

321
00:14:58,333 --> 00:15:00,333
I'm gonna major in
child psychology so I know

322
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:03,500
just the right things to put
on the page for the kids.

323
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:05,333
You're amazin, Haruka...

324
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:08,583
and someday... you will.

325
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:12,291
When you're a famous writer...

326
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:13,875
you should write a
book about four friends...

327
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:15,250
and how close they are.

328
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:17,125
That sounds nice.

329
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,458
Haruka...

330
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:34,416
Yes...

331
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:07,250
I'll go open the
front door, okay?

332
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:13,083
She's already home?

333
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:21,833
Sis, are you here?

334
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:31,000
We're home now!

335
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:33,166
Akane?

336
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:34,750
You guys are late.

337
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:38,083
It must've been a fun party.

338
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:41,708
So, Big Brother...

339
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:43,958
Did you have fun rolling
around in the sack

340
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:45,125
with my sister?

341
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:46,166
What?!

342
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,791
No...! Now just,
get out of my room!

343
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:50,500
Busted...

344
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:52,458
Akane... Tell me something:

345
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:54,375
Do you like me dating your
sister or do you hate it?

346
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:56,500
Because you just
can't have it both ways.

347
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,583
Sure I can!

348
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:13,958
Um, sorry about
the interruption.

349
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:19,458
Haruka...

350
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:22,041
We don't need to
rush any of this...

351
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,375
We have time.

352
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:27,125
I'm not going anywhere.

353
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:31,125
So, since we're together...

354
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:33,416
We should make a little wish.

355
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:36,916
Like this?

356
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,666
That's perfect.

357
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:41,375
Now keep your hand still
and repeat after me.

358
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,583
Like the brightest stars in
the darkest skies of night...

359
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:48,250
Like the brightest stars in
the darkest skies of night...

360
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,583
Hearts that have truly
joined will never fade.

361
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:53,291
Hearts that have truly
joined will never fade.

362
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:56,416
Even, if these hands
ever pull apart...

363
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,916
Even, if these
hands ever pull apart...

364
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,625
The connection between us
will never be betrayed.

365
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:22,458
I'd love it if you took the
entrance exam for Hakuryo.

366
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:29,625
You gotta be kidding me?!

367
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:30,875
Nope.

368
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:32,291
I'm actually prepping
for the Hakuryo test.

369
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:34,916
I'm impressed... For real.

370
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,375
It's her, right...?
Haruka's got you.

371
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:42,000
She does.

372
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:48,833
Oh, it figures! I'm late!

373
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:50,541
I hope Haruka isn't mad!

374
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:54,333
But if she is, she'll
forgive me when I give her this.

375
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:56,375
It'll go over huge with her!

376
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:58,000
Takayuki?

377
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:00,125
Hey, what are you
doing around here?

378
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:01,375
Mitsuki.

379
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:03,250
Hey, what's with that
get-up your wearing...?

380
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:04,750
You got a date?

381
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:07,750
No... I've just got an outing
with the swim team later.

382
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:09,833
Sounds, fun.

383
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:11,875
Will you ever get off my case?

384
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:15,083
So are you and Haruka
doing something today?

385
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:16,333
Yeah. I'm supposed to meet her

386
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:17,916
in front of the train
station here in a few.

387
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,166
It sounds like things are
going well with you two.

388
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,750
I must say I'm jealous.

389
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:22,500
You should be.

390
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:24,041
I'm a huge catch...

391
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:25,666
Well, have fun with all your
swim friends this afternoon...

392
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,250
See ya!

393
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,125
Takayuki... Hold up.

394
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:31,916
If you didn't know...

395
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,625
it's... my birthday today...

396
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:37,166
So, I, uh... Just thought...

397
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:44,208
Oh, this is the one I want.

398
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:45,083
Right here.

399
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:46,291
It almost looks like two rings.

400
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:47,375
So what?

401
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:48,750
I don't know,
it looks kinda gaudy

402
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:50,291
for someone as young as you are.

403
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:52,750
I guess you have a point...

404
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:56,666
Too much. Okay then...

405
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,875
Let's see...

406
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,750
I'll take this ring, thanks.

407
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:05,041
Wait, are you sure about that?

408
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:06,208
It's no fun to get a gift

409
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:08,625
you don't want
on your birthday...

410
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,583
Geez... Now I'm broke.

411
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:19,250
Oh, I can't thank you enough...

412
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:21,833
I'll keep this ring close to
me for the rest of my life.

413
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:23,416
You'd better...

414
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,291
And for my birthday, I expect
you to roll out the red carpet.

415
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:27,291
I'm talking caviar, expensive --

416
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:29,583
Oh crap, look
what time it is...

417
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:31,916
Uh, I gotta go! Bye!

418
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:05,083
Ambulance...?
I guess someone got hurt.

419
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:08,000
Where's Haruka?

420
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:10,250
I hope she didn't
get upset and leave.

421
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:15,750
Some young girl
in a white dress.

422
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:17,125
Yeah... it's too bad.

423
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:20,458
I wonder if she'll be okay.

424
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:22,041
That car ran right into her.

425
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:26,541
Hope she wasn't waiting
for someone. Poor thing.

426
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:30,875
Haruka...! Haruka!

427
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:36,125
Haruka?! Haruka, where are you?!

428
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:38,958
Haruka...! Excuse me, sorry!

429
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:44,083
Haruka...?!
Are you okay...?! Haruka!!

430
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:58,166
Time of accident,
two fifteen pm.

431
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:02,875
I have verified the
identity of the victim,

432
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:04,458
through her student ID...

433
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:07,791
Victim is a senior,
at Hakuryo University,

434
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:10,666
the college feeder school...
Her name is...

435
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,833
Haruka...

436
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:14,375
Suzumiya.
