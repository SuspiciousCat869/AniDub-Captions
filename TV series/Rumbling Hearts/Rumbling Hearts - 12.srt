1
00:01:58,916 --> 00:02:00,208
Takayuki!

2
00:02:00,958 --> 00:02:02,208
Takayuki!

3
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:35,666
We've been through...
a lot, huh?

4
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,541
Haru... ka.

5
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:21,083
Oh, you're up.

6
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:23,458
Yeah, hi.

7
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:26,125
How are you feeling?

8
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:29,833
You're still a little warm.

9
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:32,041
Let's take your temperature.

10
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:38,041
Here... Put it under your arm.

11
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:39,958
'Kay.

12
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:44,750
Looks like you've been sweating.

13
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:47,291
Let me get you some
clean clothes to put on.

14
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:55,541
You're lucky...

15
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:57,000
If I hadn't found
you slumped over

16
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:59,375
your cold might have
turned into pneumonia.

17
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:01,375
You're so careless sometimes.

18
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:03,208
Sorry.

19
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:04,750
Were you just gonna
sleep in the hallway

20
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:07,291
if I hadn't come home
and moved you to the bed?

21
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:08,541
You're an adult, Takayuki.

22
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:10,916
You need to start taking
better care of yourself.

23
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:13,208
Here.

24
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:15,708
Go ahead and change into
these clean clothes, okay?

25
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:17,000
Yeah

26
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:18,125
Let me guess.

27
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:19,125
You haven't eaten
anything in days...

28
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:20,708
How's rice pilaf sound?

29
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:22,250
Good.

30
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:25,000
Mitsuki?

31
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:26,583
What?

32
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:30,000
I... uh... just forget it.

33
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:44,083
I'm full.

34
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:45,166
Already?

35
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,833
Then let me give
you your medicine.

36
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:50,458
I should call work.

37
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:51,541
Don't worry about it.

38
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:53,583
I already took
care of it for you...

39
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:55,000
Your boss said to take
your time getting better

40
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:57,500
and get back to work
when you're ready.

41
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:58,791
Thanks for doing that.

42
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:00,916
You're welcome. Here.

43
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:05,958
We haven't done this in a while.

44
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:07,041
Huh?

45
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:09,083
You know just hanging
out and talking.

46
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:11,291
I know.

47
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:15,083
I've... been lonely.

48
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:21,291
I know.

49
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:23,000
I should get back to work...

50
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,666
Laundry's waiting.

51
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,208
And you should
get some more sleep.

52
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:40,750
Hi, Doctor.

53
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:44,041
I have good news...

54
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:46,041
Your sister will be out
of intensive care tomorrow.

55
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:47,000
Will she really?

56
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:48,208
Yes...

57
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:50,583
The CAT scan and the
MRI came back negative.

58
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:52,166
But I'm...

59
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,666
afraid it's not going
to get any easier.

60
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:11,583
Hi... You're finally awake

61
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:15,833
Are you starting to feel better?

62
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:19,166
Yeah.

63
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,208
We'll take your
temperature again later

64
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:22,125
and see if your fever dropped.

65
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,958
Want something to drink?

66
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:27,625
Sure.

67
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:31,791
Hey...

68
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:33,000
What is it?

69
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:35,208
I picked up your bag
at the office for you.

70
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:38,500
Really...? Thank you...

71
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,125
That's so nice of you to do that

72
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:42,250
even though you
weren't feeling well.

73
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:45,291
You're such a sweetheart...

74
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:46,666
You always have been.

75
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,416
Even back in high school...

76
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,166
everyone thought you
were the nicest guy...

77
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,916
so what about you?

78
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,708
You ever think
about the old days?

79
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:57,291
Yeah.

80
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:02,083
Me too... It seems
so far away now.

81
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:04,125
Like it was a different life.

82
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:06,541
Whenever I think
about those times,

83
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:09,166
I remember that you
were always there for me

84
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,833
when I needed you.

85
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:12,125
Oh yeah?

86
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:15,041
Even though you'd
always complain about it.

87
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:21,875
When I introduced
you to Haruka...

88
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:24,541
I thought I was just
helping her out...

89
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:25,791
you know, because she was so shy

90
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:27,416
around boys she liked.

91
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,833
I never thought you
two would actually date.

92
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:31,416
But then...

93
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,541
I never expected to feel
this way about you, either...

94
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:36,583
Never in a million years.

95
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:39,375
Then the accident happened.

96
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:41,625
Haruka fell into a coma...

97
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:42,958
and before I knew what hit me,

98
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:45,125
you and I were
dating each other...

99
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:47,041
I was so happy to be with you.

100
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:50,041
Yet at the same
time I felt so guilty.

101
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:54,250
Like I was betraying
Haruka by seeing you.

102
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:57,791
But no matter what happened,

103
00:08:57,875 --> 00:09:00,541
you were always
there by my side.

104
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:02,791
And I wanted to be by your side

105
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,416
more than anything
else in the world,

106
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,416
because you were
always so kind...

107
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,958
Not only to me,
but to Haruka as well.

108
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:11,791
It was all...

109
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:14,500
Very hard.

110
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:18,333
I basically gave up everything

111
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:20,875
so I could devote myself to you.

112
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:23,125
Then I started to realize ...

113
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:26,375
if you left me
I would have nothing...

114
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:28,875
Just, thinking about
that possibility...

115
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:31,583
It terrified me.

116
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:32,875
Mitsuki.

117
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:36,333
I thought if I sabotaged
our relationship...

118
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:39,625
then maybe the
pain would go away.

119
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:43,166
And that's why...

120
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:47,250
last night...
I slept with Shinji...

121
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:53,791
Whatever you do,
don't be mad at him ...

122
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:56,041
He's not to blame.

123
00:09:56,708 --> 00:10:00,791
But I... I was so
depressed last night.

124
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:05,583
I'm sorry I betrayed you.

125
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:16,208
Aren't you angry at me?

126
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:18,916
Mitsuki.

127
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:34,000
I trust you can take care
of yourself now, right?

128
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:37,625
Don't forget...
Take your antibiotics.

129
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:39,833
But, Mitsuki wait.

130
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:44,208
Don't leave!

131
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:45,791
I have to...

132
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:48,791
I just can't compete
with Haruka any longer.

133
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:06,916
Good morning, Akane.

134
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,125
What's up?

135
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:09,375
How come you're here
so early this morning?

136
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:10,708
Well...

137
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:12,666
I have practice later so
this is my only free time.

138
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,916
Just don't work
yourself too hard, okay.

139
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,750
I don't think I do.

140
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:18,666
Fair enough...

141
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:19,625
I just don't wanna
see you end up here

142
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:21,541
for exhaustion or something...

143
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:23,333
Your sister gave
us quite a scare.

144
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,041
But I'm glad to say
she's pulling through,

145
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:26,125
because I couldn't stand it

146
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:28,583
if something bad
happened on my watch.

147
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:33,166
By the way...

148
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,875
The boyfriend hasn't
been by in a while.

149
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:36,250
Did something happen?

150
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:39,791
Oh... I haven't seen him either.

151
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,375
Mayu, get over here!

152
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:48,250
Your order for
table seven's ready.

153
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:49,416
Okay!

154
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:53,416
Damn it...!

155
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,041
How long is that conceited jerk

156
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:57,708
gonna be on vacation?!

157
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:09,750
You should spend
some time outdoors,

158
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:11,916
even if it is just
on the balcony...

159
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:13,375
Sis...? Are you awake?

160
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:18,250
Akane?

161
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:26,125
I'm here, Sis... I'm with you.

162
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:43,708
Hello?

163
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:44,958
Takayuki, hi.

164
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:46,916
This is Sakiyama at Sky Temple.

165
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,541
Oh, hello, sir.

166
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:50,416
You sound good.

167
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,750
Are you starting to feel better?

168
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:53,500
Yeah, thanks, much better.

169
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:54,916
In fact, I think I'm over it.

170
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,333
That's real good to hear.

171
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:59,041
When do you think you'll
be ready to work again?

172
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:01,000
We could use you tonight
if you're up to it.

173
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:03,416
Plus, I was hoping to
discuss something with you.

174
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,541
I can do tonight.

175
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:06,166
I should be there around five.

176
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,500
Excellent. Thank you.

177
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:09,458
Hold on someone wants to say hi.

178
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:10,333
Hey, jerk face!

179
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:11,375
Where the hell have you been?

180
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:13,083
Thanks to you,
Mayu and I have been

181
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:14,250
getting our asses handed to us!

182
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:15,666
You might wanna think twice

183
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,125
about leaving that little
pleasure cruise of yours,

184
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:19,125
because I'm gonna make you
pay when I see you again!

185
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:20,625
Don't think I won't!

186
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:23,333
Why don't you shut up?

187
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:31,375
We're sorry.

188
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:32,583
The number you have dialed has

189
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:35,083
been disconnected or
is no longer in service.

190
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:39,166
Hazawa Trading.

191
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,541
It is, but I'm sorry,

192
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:44,000
Mitsuki will be away from
her desk this afternoon.

193
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,791
That's right...

194
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:49,083
If you would like to leave a
message I could give it to her.

195
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:51,208
Goodbye.

196
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:13,583
Akane... and Dad...? Mom...

197
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,375
Mirror?

198
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,583
What happened to me?

199
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:35,791
So, how's she doing?

200
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:37,541
Well, she appears to
be able to understand

201
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:39,333
that time has passed,
which is good

202
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:41,208
because that wasn't
the case last time

203
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:43,041
she came out of her coma.

204
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:45,708
It's too early to
say for sure, but...

205
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:48,166
If she keeps moving
at the pace she's on now,

206
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,416
she'll be able to
start rehab very soon.

207
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,125
The necessary
physical adjustments

208
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:53,791
from having been
asleep for so long

209
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:55,125
will happen with time.

210
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:56,375
And as for her mental state,

211
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:58,166
I'm hoping she'll begin
to accept the reality

212
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,000
of her situation soon...

213
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:01,666
One more thing...

214
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:07,291
She has no idea that she woke up
from the coma once before.

215
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:10,041
Are you serious?

216
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:11,458
Yes...

217
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:13,625
Mister Ito from Human
Resources has a position open

218
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:15,166
and you're first on his list.

219
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:17,375
He thinks you'd be a perfect
fit for the head office.

220
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:18,291
Really...?

221
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:19,375
That's great!

222
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:21,083
I hope you don't
mind that I went ahead

223
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:23,000
with this without
asking you first but...

224
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:25,458
I figured you'd at
least be interested.

225
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:28,625
Now all you need to
do is say yes or no...

226
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:29,833
It's a great opportunity

227
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:31,875
to start a good
career for yourself.

228
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:33,666
I know, but would you mind

229
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,041
if I took a few days
to think it over?

230
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:40,166
Sure... let me know
by Friday morning, okay?

231
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:48,541
Hey look who it is...!

232
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:49,625
What's up, Takayuki?!

233
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,000
Are you feeling better now?!

234
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:52,583
It's about time you showed up.

235
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:55,958
What are you guys doing?

236
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:57,083
What's it look like?

237
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:58,375
We're taking our break.

238
00:16:58,458 --> 00:16:59,666
Well that's obvious.

239
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,958
I meant what are you
doing with all this food?

240
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:03,833
You can't be eating out
in the dining room.

241
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:07,041
Here. These are for you.

242
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:07,833
I can see you're hungry.

243
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:09,291
Go ahead and have some.

244
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,375
What is this?

245
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:11,958
Man, you're even
dumber than I thought.

246
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:14,125
It's the receipts for all the
food we've been chowing down on.

247
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:15,833
And why should
I have to pay for it?

248
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:17,541
While you were
sitting on your butt

249
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:18,708
pretending to be sick,

250
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:20,583
Mayu and I had to
pick up your slack here!

251
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:23,000
That's why I've
given you this golden

252
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:24,958
opportunity to
make amends with us.

253
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:27,541
Let go my face!

254
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:28,458
Make amends?

255
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:29,875
Are you freaking kidding me?

256
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:31,375
You're lucky if I don't
pull your ugly face off first!

257
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:33,000
You wouldn't dare!

258
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:34,500
This is no way
to thank the person

259
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:35,958
who covered your lazy ass!

260
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:38,541
Don't try to turn
this around on me!

261
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:42,916
You'll never learn will you?

262
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:51,666
Oh... We have a customer...

263
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,708
Welcome to Sky Temple.

264
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:55,083
Dinner for one?

265
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:00,958
Shinji.

266
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:04,041
Hey... Can you spare a minute?

267
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:08,500
So, you've probably talked
to Mistsuki by now, huh.

268
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:09,791
Yeah.

269
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:13,000
Then I guess she
told you what happened?

270
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:15,166
Yeah

271
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:19,083
I see... Sorry.

272
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:23,208
You must really
hate my guts right now.

273
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:25,041
No.

274
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:26,416
How's Mitsuki doing?

275
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:32,000
I have no idea... she's gone.

276
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:34,625
Now what the hell
does that mean?

277
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:37,458
We broke up.

278
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:38,916
You broke up...?

279
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,958
And you're okay with that?

280
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:44,625
It doesn't matter how I feel.

281
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:47,000
She's the one
who broke it off...

282
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:48,541
You should ask her.

283
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:50,041
What are you, an idiot?!

284
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:51,916
Look, don't yell at me.

285
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,416
What do you expect me to do?

286
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,875
Ayu, it sounds like this

287
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:56,875
has soap opera
written all over it.

288
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:59,500
Let's go, Mayu.
We have work to do.

289
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:01,416
But it's starting to get good.

290
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:04,416
Ayu!

291
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:06,500
I know you don't
mean that, Takayuki...

292
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:07,541
And I know that deep down

293
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:09,500
you do feel
something for Mitsuki.

294
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:10,916
Whatever.

295
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,708
You don't seem to realize
she has always loved you.

296
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,833
And because your
stubborn ass refused

297
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:18,041
to be there for her when
she really needed you...

298
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:20,291
I slept with her.

299
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:22,125
I know...

300
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:25,000
And it's all my fault, right?

301
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:26,416
Get over yourself!

302
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,666
I saw you laughing and
tickling that girl back there,

303
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,416
so don't try to act
like you're innocent!

304
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,083
You're not making any sense...

305
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:33,083
Leave me alone.

306
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:34,375
Mitsuki's gone through more pain

307
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:36,208
on your behalf than
you could ever dream of!

308
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:38,875
You're right, man...
she has suffered...

309
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:42,750
All because of my actions,
and I take full responsibility.

310
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:45,458
So you realize that yet you
won't do anything about it!

311
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:46,916
What do you want...?

312
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,500
What the hell am I supposed
to do about it now?

313
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:50,791
We wouldn't even be in this mess

314
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:53,125
if you weren't so damn selfish!

315
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:56,416
The fact is, Mitsuki's
supported you this whole time...

316
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,333
And yet what have you
done for her in return?

317
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:00,416
Nothing.

318
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,916
Fine, then what do
you suggest I do?!

319
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,791
You need to figure
that out for yourself!

320
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:06,708
No, Shinji, you're wrong!

321
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:08,000
It's your turn now.

322
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:09,208
What are you talking about...?

323
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,541
My turn?

324
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:12,375
Since you're so insistent
about doing something,

325
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:14,291
why don't you start
taking care of her?

326
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:16,083
Come on...

327
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:18,791
I mean, you are in
love with her, aren't you?

328
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:26,375
You jerk! I'm not
good enough for her...!

329
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:27,458
It has to be you!

330
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:29,625
Don't you see that?!

331
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:33,000
You're a fool to let a girl
like her get away from you!

332
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:35,458
You bastard!

333
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:40,083
That's quite enough.

334
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:46,291
You're like a disease.

335
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:49,000
Everyone you surround
yourself with suffers.

336
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,958
Shin... ji.

337
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:32,375
Hi. It's Akane.

338
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,666
Haruka regained
consciousness yesterday.

339
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,875
We explained to her
that she's been asleep

340
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:40,458
for three years, and she doesn't
remember waking up before.

341
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:41,791
She wants to see you.

342
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:43,791
I know things have
been weird lately,

343
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:45,875
but if you can spare the time,

344
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:47,833
it would nice for you to visit.

345
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,500
I have baked the finest
bread for you, my love.

346
00:23:35,583 --> 00:23:37,375
Now let us break
this bread and dine

347
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:39,458
in the clouds of
eternal happiness!

348
00:23:39,541 --> 00:23:40,791
No, that's not right.

349
00:23:40,875 --> 00:23:43,458
I have baked the finest
bread for you, my love...

350
00:23:43,541 --> 00:23:45,416
Now let us break
this bread and dine

351
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,458
in the clouds of
eternal happiness!

352
00:23:47,541 --> 00:23:48,333
That was it...

353
00:23:48,416 --> 00:23:50,250
Now I can play the leading role.

354
00:23:50,333 --> 00:23:52,666
Sorry to break the
bad news to you...

355
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:55,041
But the director said
the lead role is mine.

356
00:23:55,125 --> 00:23:57,583
That's not what I heard.

357
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:00,625
It's mine.
