1
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:34,416
Isn't the sunlight sparkling
on the waves beautiful?

2
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,541
Yeah.

3
00:01:35,625 --> 00:01:38,166
I love this time
of day. Don't you?

4
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:39,875
Yeah.

5
00:01:42,625 --> 00:01:46,833
Did Mitsuki... come to see you?

6
00:01:46,916 --> 00:01:48,916
Uh-huh.

7
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,250
What happened?

8
00:01:51,791 --> 00:01:53,041
I slapped her...

9
00:01:55,541 --> 00:01:57,416
I was so upset.

10
00:02:09,791 --> 00:02:11,083
I'm sorry.

11
00:02:52,916 --> 00:02:53,875
Haruka!

12
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:55,416
I'm okay.

13
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:03,458
I'll be fine. I can do this.

14
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:17,291
You can't...
It's too soon for this.

15
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,875
I always thought
no matter what happened

16
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:44,625
to us we'd always
remain friends.

17
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:48,291
And if anything came between
us it'd work itself out.

18
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:52,625
It won't...

19
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:02,375
I know it's impossible.

20
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:31,000
I... love Mitsuki.

21
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:33,166
She stayed by my side

22
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,708
when I was ready
to give up on myself.

23
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:39,416
And because she was
there to pick me up,

24
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,458
I can be here with you.

25
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:43,833
She suffered
through all of this,

26
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:45,750
as much as any of us.

27
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:49,791
But to her, I was
somewhere else all the time.

28
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:50,875
My heart was never

29
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,666
with her the way
she deserved it to be.

30
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,125
In the end, she had no choice

31
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:57,291
but to question
why she was with me.

32
00:04:57,375 --> 00:05:00,208
Why she was even around.

33
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:04,750
And I... I never
noticed her pain.

34
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:07,708
Like it was the
suffering of a stranger...

35
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:11,916
I never even noticed.

36
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,791
Until the second
that she left me...

37
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:21,000
Then it was the only
thing I could see at all.

38
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:27,541
I owe her.

39
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:30,750
If she's in pain, it's my
responsibility to heal it.

40
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:32,916
No matter how long it takes.

41
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,083
Three years was how long it took

42
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:38,375
for my whole world to change.

43
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:41,750
But time can't be taken back.

44
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:44,083
For three years,
you lived a life

45
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:46,666
that I can't begin to know.

46
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:50,208
I've searched for the
Takayuki I used to love.

47
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:52,875
The gentle boy that
I knew in high school.

48
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:55,291
But he doesn't exist anymore...

49
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:59,125
He just vanished... Gone...

50
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:02,041
While I was asleep...
gone forever.

51
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:04,208
I can't apologize enough

52
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:06,125
for putting you through this.

53
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:08,291
But I don't regret any of it.

54
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:11,625
I don't want to ever
forget what we've seen.

55
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:18,541
It's been... lovely... a dream.

56
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:26,833
Thank you.

57
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:34,208
Once upon a time,

58
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:36,916
Mayal the fairy lost her memory.

59
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,458
It simply washed away,

60
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:42,666
and she had to live
in the forest all alone.

61
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,458
Until one day,
a girl discovered her hiding

62
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:49,875
in the bushes, and
the two became friends.

63
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:51,875
The girl called her
other friends over

64
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:56,000
and they played with Mayal
all day and into the night.

65
00:06:56,083 --> 00:07:01,166
They played all Spring, all
Summer, and into the Autumn.

66
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,083
But Mayal was not
like the others.

67
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:07,083
She aged differently
from her new friends.

68
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:08,958
As the seasons passed on,

69
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:11,291
Mayal's friends began to mature

70
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:13,291
and grow quicker than her.

71
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:15,625
They seemed to
forget about Mayal,

72
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:18,125
leaving her behind.

73
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:21,333
In the end,
her one last friend was

74
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:25,500
the very first girl
she had met so long ago.

75
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:28,208
However, this girl
had also grown up

76
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:29,708
and knew she
could no longer play

77
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:32,208
with Mayal the way she used to.

78
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:36,583
So one day, she came
back to the forest.

79
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:38,750
Seeing her...

80
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,875
And seeing the deep
sadness in her eyes...

81
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:44,875
Mayal decided
to give her a gift.

82
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:47,333
What did she give her?

83
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:50,000
The gift of parting words.

84
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:01,875
At that time, humans
had no words of parting.

85
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:05,125
And Mayal was a parting fairy.

86
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:07,875
During the turmoil
of losing her memory,

87
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:10,541
her purpose was lost to her.

88
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:12,166
This was why she
felt she was always

89
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:15,125
saying goodbye to
whomever she knew.

90
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:17,166
The girl who had become an adult

91
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:20,041
heard these words
of parting from Mayal.

92
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,708
After learning
these special words...

93
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:24,916
the girl went home...

94
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,208
she became the world's
kindest person...

95
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:30,583
knowing these words.

96
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,708
That's what brought
you and I together.

97
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:39,708
The story of Mayal's Gift.

98
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:45,166
Takayuki. I want us
to part with a smile.

99
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:47,541
'Kay?

100
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,833
Goodbye.

101
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:05,208
Goodbye.

102
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:44,666
You can't do that!!

103
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,666
What do you mean,

104
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:46,750
you're just taking
the day off...?!

105
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:48,000
I'm not gonna let you off

106
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:50,125
without you giving me
a good excuse for this!

107
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,125
He hung up on me!

108
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:14,375
I, uh...

109
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:16,250
She resigned last week.

110
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:26,541
I don't understand. Why?

111
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:31,166
Don't tell me you haven't even

112
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:34,000
spoken to her about this?

113
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:38,458
No, I haven't... Where is she?

114
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:41,291
I figured you would
be the one to know.

115
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:42,583
Ask yourself, where do you think

116
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:44,708
she would go at
a time like this?

117
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:46,166
What do you think
I've been doing...?!

118
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,041
I'm looking everywhere.

119
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:54,000
I'm sorry.

120
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:55,500
What are you going to say to her

121
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:56,708
if you do find her?

122
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:57,958
Do you know?

123
00:10:58,041 --> 00:11:00,333
Or are you just running
around, without a plan?

124
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:04,666
With the person you are,
what can you offer her?

125
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,416
I don't know...

126
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:13,208
But I... I just,
I have to see her again!

127
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:16,666
Then I can tell her...

128
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:20,958
You're so naïve... You and
Mitsuki both.

129
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:27,666
And I'm...
a bit jealous of that.

130
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,375
Hello?

131
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:10,208
Yeah...

132
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:13,083
Hi, there, boss... Huh...

133
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:14,375
So they want me to come down

134
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:16,708
to the head office
this afternoon?

135
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:18,916
Right.

136
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,583
I'm very sorry.

137
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:23,625
I almost don't
know how to say it,

138
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:25,791
but I have to turn
down the promotion.

139
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:28,291
You see...

140
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:30,333
There's someone
very special to me...

141
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:34,541
And I've hurt her in ways
I never imagined I could...

142
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:38,083
So now... I have to find her...

143
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:40,958
And make things right.

144
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:46,416
I understand.

145
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,625
You can't lose a woman like her.

146
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:53,416
They don't come around
that often. Trust me.

147
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:56,666
Thank you.

148
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:31,458
Hey, man. Have you
talked to Mitsuki...?

149
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:33,708
Just let me know if you have...

150
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:36,791
Or just tell me
when she calls you...

151
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:41,000
Can you do that? Please!

152
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:43,583
Sure, man.

153
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:50,583
Love-struck idiot.

154
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,833
Well, I'm here.

155
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,000
You wait long?

156
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:57,541
Nah.

157
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:54,541
Please, Mitsuki...
Where are you?

158
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:27,375
Takayuki...

159
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:29,458
Mitsuki...

160
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:43,125
No!

161
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:56,000
Please... Let me go.

162
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:07,416
I'm fine...

163
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:09,375
Without you, I'm fine.

164
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:11,500
I can manage on my own.

165
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:14,958
From now on,

166
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:18,000
I won't have any
problem being alone.

167
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:22,708
Well, I will... I need you.

168
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:27,375
I need you... with me.

169
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:30,000
That's all I want.

170
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:32,000
I'm not gonna be
anyone's replacement.

171
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:33,541
You know that.

172
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:38,500
Listen, you're
not a replacement.

173
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:42,375
You're not...
I love you, Mitsuki.

174
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:53,541
And Haruka...?
What happens to her?

175
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:58,041
It's over. For good.
She's out of my life.

176
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:01,791
We've said our goodbyes.

177
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:05,916
I won't ever see her again.

178
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,833
It's too late for us...

179
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:09,875
I've already moved
on with my life...

180
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:10,958
I don't ever wanna go back

181
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:13,166
to being the mess
that I was before.

182
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:18,041
Listen, when my life had
gotten so out of control...

183
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:20,458
You came along
and picked me up...

184
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:22,250
You have always
been there for me,

185
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:24,375
Mitsuki, no matter what...

186
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:29,500
That's why...
I want you to stay...

187
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:31,625
I need you to.

188
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:33,791
I don't know if
things will work out,

189
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:36,291
but I can't think of a
life without you in it.

190
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:38,500
I want to be with you.

191
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:48,000
I've missed you...

192
00:17:56,875 --> 00:18:00,625
No going back...
We start from here.

193
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:24,708
Congratulations, Haruka.

194
00:18:24,791 --> 00:18:26,416
We're all proud of you.

195
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,541
Thank you all so much.

196
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:33,291
Hotaru would have loved,
to see Haruka walk out of here.

197
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:35,125
Yeah...

198
00:18:57,125 --> 00:19:00,000
Yes! What a wonderful day!

199
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:02,500
Single men, watch your backs.

200
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:06,208
You're moving in today?

201
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:07,791
I'm proud of you.

202
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:09,166
I'm sure you'll be quite happy.

203
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,250
Hold on a sec...

204
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:12,375
Someone else wants to say 'hi'.

205
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:15,666
Hey, Takayuki is that you?

206
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,000
It's Mayu!

207
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:19,083
The restaurant just isn't
the same without you...

208
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:20,666
Please come back to work soon.

209
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,875
Ayu and I miss you so much!

210
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:26,500
Hey, dog face!!!

211
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,583
Let the record show that she
was speaking for herself there!

212
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:29,875
Contrary to what Mayu said,

213
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:31,958
I'm glad you're gone
and I hope you stay gone!

214
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:33,458
Because scum like
you doesn't deserve

215
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:35,291
to work in a place like this!

216
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:37,583
I didn't say bye.

217
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:39,125
Trust me you didn't
wanna say goodbye

218
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:40,250
to that jerk anyway.

219
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:41,500
Now let's get back to work...

220
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:43,916
The new blood needs
our help on the floor.

221
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,333
Okay! Whatever you say, Ayu!

222
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:22,291
Here you go.

223
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:23,750
Thanks. I've been
waiting for this.

224
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:25,166
This is fantastic work...

225
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,000
Let's get together again
in the next few weeks

226
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:28,875
to discuss your next project.

227
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:31,375
Okay. I have a lot
of good ideas to share.

228
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:33,416
I'm looking forward
to hearing them.

229
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,833
Take care, Haruka.
I'll see you soon.

230
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:39,416
Excuse me, miss...

231
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,750
Can I get a fruit cup and
a tea over here, please?

232
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:44,416
Hey, you.

233
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:46,416
You're here early.

234
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,833
Well I got out of
training camp early today...

235
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:51,375
So here I am...
Man, I'm thirsty.

236
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,375
Really.

237
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:58,166
Now. Please,
tell me everything...

238
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,625
You get your manuscript back?

239
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:02,041
Yup.

240
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:08,250
Wow! Awesome!

241
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:13,833
Sis, I'm so proud of you!

242
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:15,541
Thank you.

243
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:19,791
Do you mind if I read it?

244
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:23,541
I can hardly wait.

245
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:28,375
Don't... Give... Up...

246
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:31,416
Haru the tiny ermine spends
yet another endless day

247
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,791
climbing up the hill
with gritty determination.

248
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:37,583
Don't... Give... Up...

249
00:26:42,708 --> 00:26:45,166
Don't... Give... Up...

250
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:47,416
Haru had finally
found the treasure,

251
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:51,458
and with it, she now had the
faith she had been looking for.

252
00:26:51,541 --> 00:26:54,250
The faith that one day,
all of her dearest friends

253
00:26:54,333 --> 00:26:59,000
from the past would join
together to share a cozy nap.

254
00:26:59,083 --> 00:27:01,791
And that is why,
once again, she pushes

255
00:27:01,875 --> 00:27:04,708
her little body towards
the top of the big hill.

256
00:27:04,791 --> 00:27:08,500
Don't... Give... Up...

257
00:27:08,583 --> 00:27:12,291
That is how Haru
found her True Treasure.
