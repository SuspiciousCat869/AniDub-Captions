1
00:01:37,875 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm starting to get anxious

2
00:01:39,083 --> 00:01:41,500
being stuck in this
bed all the time.

3
00:01:42,625 --> 00:01:45,291
Is something wrong...? You okay?

4
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:14,833
It's gonna be alright.

5
00:02:24,041 --> 00:02:24,958
Hello?

6
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:27,750
Hi, Mistuki. You busy right now?

7
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:29,291
I'm on my lunch break.
What do you need?

8
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:30,708
Uh, nothing.

9
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:32,750
Just wanted to say I was
sorry for being late yesterday.

10
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:34,541
Oh... Okay.

11
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:40,375
Dinner was great.
Thanks for cooking it up.

12
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:44,875
So, is that it?

13
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:46,250
What?

14
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:47,666
Is that all you
were calling for?

15
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,666
Uh... yeah... sorry...

16
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:52,875
Are you--I mean, is this
a bad time for you?

17
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:55,833
No. It's as good a
time as any, I suppose.

18
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:57,458
 Do you want to go out later?

19
00:02:57,541 --> 00:02:59,541
I can't.
There's this company thing.

20
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:01,000
I have to be there.

21
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:03,791
Okay. Just don't drink too much.

22
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:04,958
You know how sake can disagree

23
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:06,666
with your stomach
if you haven't eaten.

24
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:07,750
I'll be fine.

25
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:09,291
I'll let you go then...

26
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:11,333
Sorry to bother you
in the middle of the day.

27
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:14,000
No... I'm glad you called...

28
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:15,583
Have fun at work.

29
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:18,041
Not possible, but thanks.

30
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:19,208
Get back to lunch.

31
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:21,625
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

32
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,875
I feel a sense of
responsibility with Haruka,

33
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:32,208
but that's all.

34
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:35,125
You are the one
that I love, Mitsuki.

35
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:37,250
Hey... Ya think
he's having an affair?

36
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:38,875
Why else would he sneak off...?

37
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:40,791
We've gotta teach
this guy a lesson.

38
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:42,708
As women we should
always stand together...

39
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:45,458
Cheat on one of us and
the others will find you

40
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:46,708
and stomp you into the ground!

41
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:48,250
Whoa... That's great.

42
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:49,541
We'll show the
women of this town

43
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:51,166
what he really is...

44
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:54,875
There's no way he'll ever
find a date here again!

45
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:57,625
That is one heck of
a plan, young ladies.

46
00:03:58,416 --> 00:03:59,416
Hi, boss.

47
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,375
But... Your time
would be better served

48
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:03,416
doing the job
you were hired for.

49
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:04,916
Well, Mayu!

50
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,958
What is it, Ayu?

51
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:08,541
We've got a ton
of work... Let's go!

52
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:09,708
Right!

53
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,666
Boss... What's up with them?

54
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,583
Just another plan
to take you down.

55
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:18,541
Sorry about that.

56
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:19,875
Long conversation...

57
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:22,208
I didn't know when you'd
be finished, so I started.

58
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:24,250
I would have, too.

59
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:29,541
Sounds to me like there's
trouble brewing in paradise.

60
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:31,875
Covering up your
feelings might've

61
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:34,416
worked in school,
but not in the real world.

62
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,875
Out here, if you
have a bad time,

63
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:37,875
people can see right through it.

64
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:40,125
Stop taking
everything so seriously.

65
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:43,125
Loosen up and things around
you will loosen up, too.

66
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:46,041
What do you know about me?

67
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,625
You think you've got
me all figured out,

68
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:51,291
but you have no idea
what I'm dealing with.

69
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:56,208
I'm sorry...
That was so rude of me.

70
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:59,541
I was wondering
when that human side

71
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:02,458
of you was going to come out.

72
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:05,375
What do you say we
enjoy ourselves tonight?

73
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:09,916
Hi, Takayuki!

74
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,166
How you doing, Hotaru?

75
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,708
Doing great, thank you...

76
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:13,791
But you're a little late.

77
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:15,208
Visiting hours already ended.

78
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:16,458
We were short staffed,

79
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:17,833
so I had to work overtime
at the restaurant.

80
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:19,291
Have you seen Akane?

81
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:22,958
Yeah. She left here
just a little while ago.

82
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:24,666
Oh, that's too bad.

83
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,583
Evening, boyfriend.

84
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:30,000
Did you do something
to Haruka yesterday?

85
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:31,708
He's not that
kind of guy, Fumie.

86
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:32,416
Oh, calm down.

87
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,083
I didn't mean that...

88
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:36,125
Did you two make some
kind of wish or something?

89
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:37,375
Uh, yeah...

90
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:40,500
How... sweet...
He's such a romantic.

91
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:41,958
It's just something we said...

92
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,958
but Haruka's always
liked to call it a wish.

93
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:45,208
What brought that up?

94
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:46,291
A wish...

95
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:47,833
You mean wishing on a star...?

96
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:49,083
Like, the poem?

97
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:51,208
Kinda, but it
wasn't the same words.

98
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:52,458
I think she made it up.

99
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:54,125
She always had me
repeat the words she said.

100
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:55,375
Why are you asking?

101
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:56,750
Did she say something?

102
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:58,625
She danced around the
subject when I asked her...

103
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:00,416
but no one looks that
excited about something

104
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,166
if they aren't.

105
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,541
She's remembered something.

106
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:06,708
Yep... It's coming back...

107
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:08,833
She's been remembering
a buncha stuff...

108
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:11,583
And she's been holding on
to the memories for a while.

109
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:13,791
Hotaru, that's not
your place to say.

110
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:15,208
You're just a nurse.

111
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,166
But he's her boyfriend...

112
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,458
So, he should know.

113
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:20,416
That's for the doctor to say.

114
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,333
You started it... Remember.

115
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:24,791
But, at any rate--

116
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:26,125
She's remembering things.

117
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:27,916
And that's what matters...

118
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,916
I won't tell anyone.

119
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,916
Thanks... We need our jobs.

120
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,083
She's remembering
because of you.

121
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:34,750
Oh... No.

122
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:36,041
You're late, Takayuki.

123
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:38,166
Hi, Doctor.

124
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,583
Long day slinging coffee?

125
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:40,750
Yeah.

126
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,666
I know it's after hours,
but can I see her?

127
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,291
Sure... Go on...

128
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:46,375
She's been waiting
for you all day.

129
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:49,208
Cool... Thanks.

130
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:58,375
Hey!

131
00:06:58,458 --> 00:06:59,750
Where have you been?

132
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:00,583
Working late.

133
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:02,625
Sorry. How are you doing?

134
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:04,458
Oh... Great...

135
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:06,333
Especially now that you're here.

136
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:08,875
I'm happy.

137
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:13,875
It's gonna be alright.

138
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,750
Is something wrong?

139
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:19,583
I don't have food
on my face again do I?

140
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:21,708
Oh, no... I just...

141
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:23,875
I pulled an all-nighter last
night...

142
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:26,125
I guess I'm still
kinda dazed-out from it.

143
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:28,291
I bet...
You shouldn't do that...

144
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:30,250
Getting no sleep
will wear you out.

145
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:31,833
Nah... Besides, if I don't put

146
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:34,333
in the hours studying...
I'll fail.

147
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:36,291
There's tons of
time until the exams.

148
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:37,958
You don't have
to break your back.

149
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:38,958
You're right.

150
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,541
I'll be more
careful with myself.

151
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:41,666
You promise?

152
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,458
Yeah. Of course I do.

153
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:47,666
Are you serious?

154
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,791
Thanks for that.

155
00:07:58,458 --> 00:07:59,541
Are you bored?

156
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:01,750
No, I'm having a great time.

157
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:03,166
So this is what
you always look like

158
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,333
when you're having fun?

159
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:06,208
I'm sorry.

160
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:08,708
Even your apologies sound bored.

161
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:10,625
Forget about that
boyfriend for a while.

162
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:12,833
Alright, let's get
this evening rolling!

163
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:14,458
Who's our first victim tonight?

164
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:16,416
Here...! I've had
just enough to drink...!

165
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,458
And Mitsuki's singing with me!

166
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:19,625
Huh?!

167
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,583
Chill out, will ya...?
Time to cut loose.

168
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:23,500
But I'm a terrible singer,
you have no idea!

169
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:25,875
Oh, I seriously doubt that...

170
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:29,250
So... Who wants to hear some
old fashioned rock and roll?

171
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:31,791
You're gonna love this.

172
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:33,416
These people are so drunk,

173
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,333
they wouldn't even know
if you sang like a dying cat.

174
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:39,916
Well?

175
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:43,208
Yeah.

176
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:43,958
Come on, fellas!

177
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:45,500
Let's rock this joint.

178
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,208
This is nice.

179
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:06,625
Once more...?

180
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:08,208
You can't get
enough of that wish.

181
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:11,333
Sorry. I didn't know
it was becoming annoying.

182
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:13,250
I didn't mean it like that.

183
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:15,458
Then...

184
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:16,541
Let's do it again.

185
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:17,875
Sure.

186
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,375
Come on legs...

187
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:27,583
I think you had a few
too many of those big beers.

188
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:29,791
Yep! And I coulda
had a few more.

189
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:31,833
You finally got
that mood off the ground.

190
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:34,375
Well... I have you
to thank for it--

191
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:36,750
Oh, watch it!

192
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:49,250
Here.

193
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:51,416
I'm okay.

194
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,166
Do I need to call a cab?

195
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,583
No...! It's alright!

196
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,500
No... I'll be fine.

197
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,958
Everything's gonna be alright.

198
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,958
Even if these hands
ever pull apart...

199
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:20,333
The connection between
us will never be betrayed.

200
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:33,916
Takayuki...

201
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:45,541
Sis... I forgot my bookbag--

202
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:49,166
Oh... Okay...

203
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,958
Akane, it's... It's not...

204
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,666
Akane!

205
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:08,791
Akane! Hold up!
You're overreacting!

206
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:18,625
What are you doing?

207
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:19,875
Me?!

208
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:21,375
What am I doing?

209
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:23,875
You don't have
any feelings for her!

210
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:25,916
You don't... know that.

211
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,875
I don't?

212
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:31,083
You shouldn't even
be here, Takayuki!

213
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:33,416
You wouldn't even be here
if I hadn't called you!

214
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,000
You stopped seeing her.

215
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:36,583
You turned your back
on a helpless person

216
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:38,541
and gave your
heart to someone else.

217
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:40,541
You don't love my sister.

218
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:41,666
You love her.

219
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:44,625
So, quit playing
with Haruka's emotions.

220
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:46,375
Just leave her alone.

221
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:48,666
For the sake of all of us.

222
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:55,083
You're wrong.

223
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:58,041
You're wrong about me.

224
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:04,375
You don't know me.

225
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:08,916
You're wrong.

226
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:30,750
I didn't expect to
see you... here. Mitsuki?

227
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:34,500
Welcome home, Takayuki!

228
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:35,208
You're smashed...

229
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:36,750
What were you drinking?

230
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:38,833
I'm not drunk.

231
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,708
What're you looking at?

232
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:44,875
Oh... Just a few things...

233
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:46,666
With all the drama around here,

234
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,375
we had to put it
off for a while...

235
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:51,291
I thought, why not get this
apartment train rolling again.

236
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:52,666
You know, since
Haruka's getting better,

237
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,166
I thought we should...

238
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:58,291
I found a nice place.

239
00:12:58,375 --> 00:12:59,666
It's a tad on
the expensive side.

240
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,166
But I think we can afford it.

241
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,916
We split the rent,
go out a few less times

242
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,125
a month and we're good.

243
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:05,750
It's near the station,
which is perfect.

244
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:07,250
And it's a... you know...

245
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:09,500
it's a... corner unit!

246
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:10,916
It's got a killer view.

247
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,500
It'll go fast, so we
need to head out there

248
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,458
this weekend and
take a look... 'Kay?

249
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:15,875
I can call the
rental agent tomorrow

250
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:17,208
and set up a time.

251
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:19,375
So what day's gonna
work out better for you?

252
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:20,416
Me...?

253
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,750
I think Saturday
would work out best,

254
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:25,000
because then the--Whatcha
got there...?

255
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:26,958
Hey, thanks, so what's
your weekend looking like?

256
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:28,750
Wait-wait!
Not Saturday. I gotta client.

257
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:29,958
That's right.

258
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:31,666
I guess Sunday would
be a better day then...

259
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:32,916
Whaddaya say to that?

260
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,500
Is Sunday gonna work
out okay for you?

261
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:37,416
Slow down.
Let's wait on it.

262
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:40,458
This moving in thing--It's
not the kind of thing

263
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:43,000
we need to be rushing into...

264
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:44,666
We can do it once
Haruka's been released

265
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:47,000
from the hospital.

266
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:49,958
Wait... This doesn't
make any sense...

267
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:52,875
You're the one who said we
should find a place together...

268
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:54,625
You're the one who
took me out of here

269
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,875
to find a place we both wanted.

270
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:58,625
I know... But Haruka--

271
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:02,083
What does she have
to do with any of this?!

272
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:03,291
What difference does it make

273
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:05,166
if that sad little girl
is better or dead?!!

274
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:06,083
This is our business!

275
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:08,000
She has nothing to do with us!

276
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:10,041
Why are you acting
like a crazy person?

277
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:11,833
Because that's how I feel!

278
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:13,125
Thanks to you!

279
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:14,291
You're drunk...

280
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:17,166
I never said we
couldn't move in together.

281
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:21,041
Have you even told her?

282
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:23,500
I bet she has no idea...

283
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:25,250
When do you plan on
breaking the news...?

284
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:27,791
Or would you rather keep the
two of us a secret forever?

285
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:28,541
What...?

286
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:29,875
You... You're losing it.

287
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:31,583
Am I? Or am I dead right?

288
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:33,416
Tell me!

289
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,375
I don't need to take this!

290
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:36,833
Next time you wanna get bombed

291
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:39,666
and yell at someone,
pick another apartment.

292
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,458
Psycho...

293
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,291
Wait!

294
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:50,000
What are you doing...?

295
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:53,625
You could hit
somebody with those!

296
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:01,250
I'm drunk...
So what about it...?

297
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:04,541
I need something to turn
to since I don't have you...

298
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:07,375
Everything has
turned so miserable.

299
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:11,041
I can barely lift
my head in the mornings.

300
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:16,583
What's happening to you...?

301
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,833
What's brought all this on?

302
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:21,416
You still love her.

303
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:26,166
You love Haruka
more than you love me.

304
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,958
That's not true.

305
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:29,958
Of course it is...

306
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:32,083
I'm not blind to
how you look at her.

307
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:33,041
You're wrong...

308
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:34,458
I'm not in love with her.

309
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:35,458
I swear it...

310
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:36,791
Remember I told you...

311
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:39,125
It's gonna be alright?

312
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:40,833
You don't believe that, do you?

313
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:42,125
Of course I do!

314
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:44,958
No!

315
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:46,625
You don't know how you feel...!

316
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:47,875
And you don't
treat someone you love

317
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:49,875
the way you've treated me!

318
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:53,333
Mitsuki...! Don't run off!

319
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,833
Mitsuki!

320
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:20,625
Thanks for coming in.

321
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:22,458
You kids were so
well behaved today...

322
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:27,541
What's wrong with him?

323
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:29,625
He seems more
depressed than usual.

324
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:33,416
I would say that his
steamy love affair went sour

325
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,000
and now he's emotionally
bankrupt inside.

326
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:38,500
Oh... That would
make a lot of sense.

327
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:41,333
The hopeless romantic
crashed and burned.

328
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:46,666
Ah... Takayuki,
just who I wanted.

329
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,750
Hi, boss. What can I do for you?

330
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:50,166
I'd like to introduce you.

331
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,583
This is Mr. Ito, the director

332
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:53,625
of Human Resources
from corporate.

333
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:55,041
It's a pleasure to meet you...

334
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:56,250
This is my card.

335
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:57,625
Nice to meet you.

336
00:16:57,708 --> 00:16:59,041
I was just telling Mr. Ito

337
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:01,166
what an excellent
floor manager you are.

338
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,708
Thanks.

339
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:05,125
Takayuki, you're not currently
enrolled in college are you?

340
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:06,958
No... Why?

341
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:09,041
Is there any particular
reason you're not?

342
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:10,916
Well, I just didn't, um--

343
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,166
Oh, how rude of me...

344
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,041
I don't even know you
and I say that...

345
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:15,458
I got ahead of myself...

346
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:18,125
I'm running late so
I have to go now...

347
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:20,583
But I'll be back later in
the week to check on things.

348
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:22,166
Good to see you, Mr. Ito.

349
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:25,000
Nice to meet you, Takayuki.

350
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:26,708
You, too.

351
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:29,541
He's a busy man.

352
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:30,958
You were lucky to talk to him.

353
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:31,916
Why would the director

354
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,375
of Human Resources come here?

355
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:35,666
Still can't figure
it out, huh, genius?

356
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,750
There's a certain person
working in the restaurant

357
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:39,458
whose mind is always
swimming in thoughts

358
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:41,833
of lust, greed,
and slacking off.

359
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:43,333
Word of this idiot made its way

360
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:44,500
up to the head office...

361
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:45,833
and they sent their
man to investigate,

362
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:47,666
'cause if they let
this guy stay on...

363
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,916
The Sky Temple's
name will be soiled.

364
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Who would do
something like that, Ayu?

365
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:53,291
Who do you think?

366
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:54,500
If they don't can him soon,

367
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:56,208
his behavior will bring
down the restaurant.

368
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:57,958
No... They can't shut us down!

369
00:17:58,041 --> 00:17:59,166
I need this job!

370
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,291
Oops.

371
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:04,541
Oh... I'm so disappointed
in you, Takayuki.

372
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,416
I would never let that happen.

373
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,458
Here... Let me show
you the real problem.

374
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:10,750
Here come the
false accusations--

375
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,125
If anyone's
hurting our reputation,

376
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:14,958
it's gonna be
little miss pig-tails.

377
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:16,458
Say that to my face, jerk!

378
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:18,041
You do have a nasty attitude.

379
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:19,708
No! He makes me like this!

380
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:22,208
But, Ayu, I thought
you were on our side!

381
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:23,875
Have you lost your mind?!

382
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:24,833
I dunno...

383
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:26,416
I have heard you out there...

384
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,875
'How long does it take you
to pick out a dessert...?!

385
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:30,375
Tell me you want the cake,

386
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:32,625
like you always do,
you fat tub-a-lard!'...

387
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:35,500
That's behavior I would have to
question in this line of work.

388
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:37,458
You... You're so lying...

389
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:39,666
I've never spoken
such rude things.

390
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:40,750
I'm telling the truth...

391
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:41,833
Aren't I, Mayu?

392
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:43,041
Yep...!

393
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:44,333
She talks like that
to all the customers.

394
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:45,250
I do not!!

395
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,083
I think we got a witness, boss.

396
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:49,416
I guess I'll contact corporate.

397
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:54,375
'Kay... You can stop...

398
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:55,958
We're done now.

399
00:18:56,875 --> 00:19:01,083
Now... That's... it!!!

400
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:02,416
You're still on the clock!

401
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,625
You go after him now and
you'll get fired for sure!

402
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:05,166
Let go of me...

403
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,000
I know what I'm doing.

404
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:07,208
I'm gonna get back to work.

405
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:09,041
I'll be on the
floor if you need me.

406
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:11,583
Sure... I'm gonna
watch this thing play out.

407
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:13,208
Right.

408
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:14,583
Come here...! Coward!

409
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:16,083
You think you can
just get away with that?!

410
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:18,416
You're busted...
Don't make it worse!

411
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:22,250
I hate you so much...

412
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:24,916
I hope you step in cat crap!

413
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,208
Hi, this is Mitsuki.

414
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:29,583
I'm not anywhere near my phone

415
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:31,500
because I'm a busy girl
and that's just how we are.

416
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:33,166
If you want to, leave
a message after the beep,

417
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,708
and I'll get back to you
if I want to. Bye.

418
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:43,500
Oh. I didn't realize
that she'd be asleep.

419
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:46,458
Yeah... She crashed early.

420
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:49,125
They ran a whole slew
of tests on her today...

421
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:51,000
I think it just wore her out.

422
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:52,333
I'd be tired, too.

423
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:54,666
Sorry you came all the
way out here for nothing.

424
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,208
It's still good to see you.

425
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:58,791
Thanks... I'll be
back tomorrow afternoon.

426
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:01,666
Sure... And we'll still be here.

427
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:02,958
Takayuki, did you hear?

428
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:04,125
What?

429
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:05,958
About what happened
to Haruka's sister.

430
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:08,500
Something happened to Akane?

431
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:11,083
Yeah, she won another
huge swimming meet!

432
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:13,458
Oh... Right.

433
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:15,375
She's doing really
well this season...

434
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:16,833
When her mom was
here earlier today,

435
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:19,541
she couldn't stop going
on about how well it went.

436
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:23,208
Yeah... That sounds like her.

437
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:24,708
She's just amazing...

438
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:27,625
I hear she's practically a
shoe-in for the Olympic team...

439
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:30,125
And one day, I'm gonna
swim as well as her.

440
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:31,125
How's that gonna happen

441
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:32,583
if you're in the
nursing program?

442
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:34,458
I can do it... Trust me...

443
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:37,416
It's just gonna
take really hard work.

444
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,875
That's great...

445
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:40,708
She's living the dream.

446
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:54,666
I heard about the swim meet.

447
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:59,583
You've been working pretty hard.

448
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:06,125
Oh, well...

449
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,250
Welcome home.

450
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:39,916
Thanks.

451
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:45,833
I'm sorry about yesterday...

452
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:49,958
how I acted.
But I've made a decision.

453
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:53,125
I wanna live here
with you, Takayuki.

454
00:21:57,875 --> 00:21:59,750
Is that alright?

455
00:23:35,416 --> 00:23:36,416
Hello?

456
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,416
I think my new
boyfriend might ditch me

457
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,875
and go back to
his old girlfriend

458
00:23:38,958 --> 00:23:40,250
and I just don't know what
to do about the whole thing.

459
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:41,541
I'm losing my mind.

460
00:23:41,625 --> 00:23:43,208
Who cares?

461
00:23:44,708 --> 00:23:45,333
What is it?

462
00:23:45,416 --> 00:23:46,208
You hung up on me

463
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:47,375
without giving me any advice.

464
00:23:47,458 --> 00:23:48,375
What's the deal?

465
00:23:48,458 --> 00:23:49,958
You're an idiot!

466
00:23:51,916 --> 00:23:53,083
I'm so sick of this!

467
00:23:53,166 --> 00:23:54,750
Would you two get out
of the conference room

468
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:56,041
and get back to work?

469
00:23:56,125 --> 00:23:57,625
Who cares you idiot!
