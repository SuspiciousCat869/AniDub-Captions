1
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:24,375
A book from before?

2
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:26,166
I hope it's ok.

3
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,416
Just be aware that
her memory is returning...

4
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,625
albeit slowly.

5
00:02:29,708 --> 00:02:30,875
So be careful what you say,

6
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:32,583
but it should be ok
to give her the book...

7
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:34,041
I just hope that she likes it.

8
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:35,291
Thanks.

9
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:36,958
She may ask you all
kinds of questions...

10
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:38,375
but that's fine.

11
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:39,708
You don't have to
answer all of them.

12
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:41,791
Just try to keep
her relatively calm.

13
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:43,291
Yes.

14
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:50,375
You found it?

15
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:52,166
Just as I promised.

16
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:01,208
What's wrong?

17
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:05,041
Is this book new?

18
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:14,416
You know, if it's damaged...?

19
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,375
I can just go exchange it.

20
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:17,875
That's not it!

21
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:22,125
It's just... well, I...

22
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,541
Takayuki... it's just that...

23
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:35,166
I had to look
everywhere for this book.

24
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,208
It's extremely
popular these days.

25
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:39,500
But if you don't want it

26
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:41,458
I suppose I could take it back.

27
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:51,083
Oh, please don't.
I mean... Thanks.

28
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:10,125
Takayuki.

29
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:12,458
Hey Akane.

30
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:16,041
I thought you went home earlier.

31
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:20,041
Seems like, Sis might remember.

32
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:22,833
Were you listening to us?

33
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:26,875
I know it's good...

34
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:28,583
for her to remember...

35
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:30,208
And I know I should
be happy for her,

36
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:34,083
but for some reason...
I just can't be...

37
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:36,958
And I have no idea why that is.

38
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:40,833
Sorry, Akane...
I guess I'm just babbling.

39
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:43,500
Yeah, well...

40
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,541
I'm sorry.

41
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:54,500
I'm fine. It's nothing.

42
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:57,833
No... It's a fever...

43
00:04:57,916 --> 00:04:59,958
And your cold is
getting a lot worse.

44
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:02,375
Have you gone to the doctor?

45
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:04,541
I told you, it's nothing...

46
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:06,708
Just a little cold, okay?

47
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:11,666
Come on.

48
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:19,291
I'm glad we caught
Dr. Kozuki before she left.

49
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:20,958
I'm sorry about this.

50
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:22,583
No problem.

51
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:25,083
Just promise you'll take
care of yourself, okay.

52
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:30,041
This sucks.

53
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:41,041
Why do you have to be
such a nice person...?

54
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:42,458
It sucks.

55
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:49,916
I'm nice... yeah right.

56
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:52,250
I love her...

57
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:55,166
I mean Mitsuki. I do.

58
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,750
I really do love her...
I'm not nice.

59
00:05:57,833 --> 00:06:00,750
I'm just doing what I feel
I have to do in all this...

60
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:04,541
It's over, between me
and Haruka, I know that.

61
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:07,250
But I just can't abandon her.

62
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:11,791
I guess I feel... lost.

63
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,583
Hey, are you alright...?

64
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:28,375
Don't worry about
my stupid cold.

65
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:30,333
Really, I'm fine.

66
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:32,708
Are you sure...? I don't mind...

67
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:34,875
Thank you.

68
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:40,125
You know, I suppose
you aren't a bad person.

69
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:41,750
Anyone could've
given up that easy,

70
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:44,833
when they saw
someone like that...

71
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:46,250
Good night.

72
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:06,000
Mitsuki!

73
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:11,916
Mitsuki!

74
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,916
Uh, yes?

75
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,333
Look at this...
it's wrong again.

76
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:18,333
I'm sorry.
I'll take care of it...

77
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:19,583
Could you tell me
what I did wrong?

78
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,958
We have been over
this a hundred times!

79
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,916
What's wrong with you?

80
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,166
You should know
how to do this...

81
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,958
But you can't do the
little things right.

82
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:33,958
You see this?

83
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:35,375
What exactly am I looking for?

84
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:38,375
Watch that attitude...
and that tone of voice.

85
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:40,958
Well, please... point out
the mistake and I'll--

86
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:42,458
That's not the point!

87
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:49,625
Never mind.
Just redo the whole thing.

88
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:51,041
Right.

89
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:52,541
Hey, Mitsuki.
Your copies are done.

90
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:54,750
'Kay, thanks.

91
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:57,208
Ms. Ishida?

92
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:59,625
Your husband's on
line three, ma'am.

93
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,833
I told you not
to call me at work.

94
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:06,708
What?

95
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:12,083
I-I can't talk now...
I'm at work!

96
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:14,666
I'm taking a cigarette break.

97
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:23,250
I'm sorry you had to hear that.

98
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:25,125
It's such a mess.

99
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:26,666
You see, he had an affair...

100
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,166
Should've seen it coming...

101
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,750
We've been living
more like roommates

102
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:30,916
than a proper husband and wife

103
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,916
for a pretty long time now...

104
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,958
It's just so screwed up.

105
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,125
I figured divorce
was the best thing...

106
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:38,250
Sometimes it's hard.

107
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:40,208
I didn't mean to
lash out at you.

108
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:41,375
Well, for the record,

109
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:43,625
I know what
you're going through.

110
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:46,666
Really?

111
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:50,708
Yeah, but I don't have it
all figured out like you do.

112
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:53,541
Do you still love him?

113
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:54,916
Yeah.

114
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,166
I see.

115
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,583
Well, that changes
things a bit, doesn't it?

116
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,083
In my case it's easy.

117
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:04,208
I don't love him anymore so
walking away is no big deal.

118
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:06,208
But I don't know
what to tell you to do.

119
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:07,583
I can say things
that might work,

120
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:09,625
but I can't tell you
what's right for you.

121
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:12,000
That's the problem with advice.

122
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:13,125
Listen, Mitsuki.

123
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:14,458
Sometimes in order
to get an answer...

124
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:17,041
you have to push a little
harder than you think.

125
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:19,291
If you just stand there...

126
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:22,375
Life will pass you
by in an instant.

127
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,250
I just...

128
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:29,125
I'm just too
scared of the answer.

129
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:30,958
But it's your answer, Mitsuki.

130
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:32,833
No one else can get it for you.

131
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:34,833
That's the hardest part.

132
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:37,125
I guess I just need to realize

133
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:39,291
that there's no going back now.

134
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:41,791
The past is just that--the past.

135
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,958
But your future is wide open.

136
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:45,791
Are you going to sit back
and live in your world,

137
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:47,375
acting like you
have a relationship,

138
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:50,541
when all you have is something
to worry about day and night?

139
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:52,083
I might not be
doing the right thing.

140
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:54,458
I might be making a
mistake with my choice.

141
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:56,833
But it's my choice and my life.

142
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:59,500
If we don't live,
what's the point...?

143
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:02,041
I may get my heart
crushed by the end,

144
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:03,750
but once I have an answer...

145
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:06,208
I am free to move
on with what I want...

146
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:09,416
the rest I have to leave up
to fate or whatever you call it.

147
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,500
You need to be thinking
about yourself.

148
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:13,833
The only one that can
truly make you happy.

149
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:16,375
If you do nothing,
you get nothing.

150
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:22,000
I just don't know.

151
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,583
What...? He really
wants me there?

152
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:30,416
Yes... He left a message
saying that you're needed...

153
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,916
He wants you to
come by the main office

154
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,708
at your earliest convenience,

155
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:35,375
but I'd do it soon,
if I were you.

156
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:36,416
Alright.

157
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,666
Let me know when
a good time will be

158
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,541
and I'll tell him that
you're coming over.

159
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:41,625
Yes sir,
I'll definitely do that.

160
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:44,083
Take your time,
but don't wait too long...

161
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:46,916
This could mean great
things for you in the future.

162
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:52,250
Just let me know what you
decide so I can tell him.

163
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,500
Takayuki...

164
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:57,208
Does this mean you're
moving up in the company?

165
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:59,083
They're probably
just short-handed.

166
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:00,750
This one in upper management...?

167
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:03,000
Come on. He doesn't
have the brain power--

168
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:05,208
Let me go...! You creep...!

169
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,333
Get your hands off me!

170
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:08,208
I'm sorry, I have no brain power

171
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:10,875
so I can't understand
a word you're saying.

172
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:15,750
Stop that crap.

173
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:17,041
Don't spread you
brainless germs...

174
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:18,833
I don't wanna
catch your disease.

175
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:21,083
Shut up! I don't need
any of this today--

176
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:25,500
Gotta cold...? I heard
there's one going around.

177
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:26,958
Yeah.

178
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:29,791
I swear if you get me sick
you will totally regret it!

179
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,041
Yeah, right.

180
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:34,708
What're you doing, moron!

181
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:36,791
Mayu! What are you waiting for?

182
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:37,916
Let's get outta here!

183
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Ok.

184
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:40,125
I'm sorry, Takayuki,

185
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:41,458
but I have to run
away from you now.

186
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:43,750
I hope you'll forgive me.

187
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:46,791
Those idiots.

188
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:52,583
I guess I must've
caught Akane's cold.

189
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:37,208
My hands.

190
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:42,916
They don't seem...
like... they're mine.

191
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:50,291
If you do nothing,
you get nothing.

192
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:53,833
What am I supposed to do?

193
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:04,458
Are you ok?

194
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:07,666
Hey...

195
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,750
Aren't you... Mitsuki?

196
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:13,250
Yeah, you're Mitsuki Hayase
of Hiiragi Academy.

197
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:15,041
The two of us were on

198
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:17,375
Ichiritsu High's swim
team back in the day...

199
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:20,125
We met you at a couple
of tournaments, remember?

200
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:25,208
It's weird, running
into you like this...

201
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:28,000
What a small world
we live in. Whoa.

202
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:32,250
Oh no. Looks like
you broke your heel.

203
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:44,000
Hey, what's up?

204
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,875
Oh, it's the boyfriend.

205
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:48,666
So, you're flying solo out
here tonight, I take it.

206
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,333
Yep. Just me.

207
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:53,416
Is it ok if I see Haruka?

208
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,416
Well, the doctor needs
to have a word with you.

209
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,833
But, if you'd wait just a
moment, I'll ring her up...

210
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:03,583
Doctor Kozuki. Takayuki's here.

211
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:08,375
Akane.

212
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:11,000
Thank you very much
for your help yesterday.

213
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:12,250
Are you feeling any better?

214
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:14,416
Yep, you know I'm resilient.

215
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,458
I've got a great immune system.

216
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:19,333
Awesome... that's great news.

217
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,708
Hey, Boyfriend...

218
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:25,208
The doctor told me she'd be
here in about twenty minutes.

219
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:29,666
Kyoko Aota?

220
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,458
Yup, she was team captain and,

221
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:32,666
boy, was she hard on us.

222
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:33,791
You remember?

223
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:35,583
That girl had one
helluva mean streak.

224
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:37,458
Man, why'd you have
to bring her up?

225
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:38,583
What a bummer.

226
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:40,458
But she totally
idolized you, Mitsuki.

227
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:42,750
Yeah man, she talked
about you all the time.

228
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:45,666
Especially after you guys
beat us at regionals.

229
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,541
What is she up to these days?

230
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:49,416
She swims in world
championships now.

231
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,208
Seems like she's gonna make
the Olympic team for sure.

232
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:53,875
What about you?

233
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:55,208
Did you sign up with a sponsor?

234
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:57,958
I mean if we had both of
you on the Olympic team...

235
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:00,791
Man, the rest of the world
would be in big trouble.

236
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:14,291
It's so nice out here.

237
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:15,875
Sure is.

238
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:19,083
It would be great
if it stayed like this.

239
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:20,458
Yeah...

240
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,166
Oh.

241
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:29,125
Those are nice...
are they for Haruka?

242
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:31,500
Yeah...

243
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:34,541
Takayuki?

244
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:36,833
Sorry about the wait.

245
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:55,958
Could you make it
extra dry, please?

246
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:58,666
With, uh, four olives?

247
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,416
Sorry, but I have
to get outta here

248
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,416
Oh, is something wrong?

249
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,375
No, not really.
I just, gotta go.

250
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:06,333
I'm sorry.

251
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:07,583
Don't you worry,

252
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:09,250
I'll come up with the
greatest excuse ever.

253
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:10,208
Count on me.

254
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:11,500
Thanks!

255
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,375
I'm being an idiot.

256
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:27,833
Mitsuki?

257
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:29,833
Nah, can't be.

258
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:44,666
Ready, honey?

259
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:51,541
Mitsuki!

260
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:54,208
What the hell are you doing?

261
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:56,166
Who is this loser?
Where's Takayuki?

262
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,833
The lady's with me.

263
00:17:57,916 --> 00:17:59,833
Well now she's not!

264
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:01,500
Hey, come on.

265
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:03,166
No, Shinji.

266
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,291
What do you mean?

267
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:05,708
I'm okay.

268
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:07,583
You're wasted.
What're you talking about?

269
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:08,708
Hey!

270
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:11,208
She's saying get
the hell outta here!

271
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:12,208
Leave us alone!

272
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:13,583
Oh, you're dead.

273
00:18:56,958 --> 00:19:00,666
Haruka... You've got visitors.

274
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,333
What's up? You ok?

275
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:14,083
Could you please tell me
what today's date is?

276
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,458
Just how many days
have passed since--

277
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:19,708
Haruka.

278
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:22,125
Please, answer me, Takayuki.

279
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:25,958
Haruka, I don't understand.
What's wrong?

280
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:27,625
Don't patronize me!

281
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,208
Haruka, just calm down...

282
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:31,416
Now tell us
what's bothering you.

283
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,125
I am calm...!

284
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:35,125
And you want to know
what's bothering me?

285
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:39,166
My hair wasn't this long
when the accident happened.

286
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,666
My fingers...

287
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,958
They weren't so
thin and frail-looking.

288
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:44,916
This isn't me...

289
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,541
This isn't,
how I remember me at all.

290
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:50,791
Haruka...

291
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:52,500
You're gonna be okay,
it's just that...

292
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:55,458
No! I'm not! I'm different.

293
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:57,333
Why won't you
answer my question?

294
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:59,625
What is today's date?

295
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:01,541
Please. I need to know.

296
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:03,125
Haruka.

297
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:06,166
You owe me the truth!
Just tell me!

298
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:07,291
Calm down.

299
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:09,208
Why? Why won't you
answer my question?

300
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,875
Why do you lie to me...?
Why...?!

301
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:12,666
I hate this!

302
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,208
Haruka, just calm down...!

303
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:15,958
I hate you!

304
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:18,958
You're right, Haruka.

305
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:21,166
This is a lie...
Every bit of it.

306
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,666
It's been a little
over three years now...

307
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,166
Nobody told you that you've been

308
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,333
in a coma since the
day of the accident.

309
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:31,916
Akane, stop it!

310
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:35,125
Is that true?

311
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:37,875
To top it off...

312
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:43,291
Takayuki has been sleeping
with your best friend, Mitsuki.

313
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:46,916
What're you doing?!

314
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,583
Everyone is determined
to keep the truth from you.

315
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:50,916
That's enough.

316
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:51,916
Everyone has been lying
to you from the beginning.

317
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,166
Stop this now!

318
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,083
Even I'm lying to you.
This uniform is a lie.

319
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:57,333
I'm not in middle
school anymore!

320
00:20:57,416 --> 00:20:59,166
And Takayuki
isn't in high school!

321
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:02,708
He isn't studying for the exam;
he didn't even take the exam!

322
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:05,333
And it's all because you
can't remember anything!

323
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:06,958
If you hadn't been at the
train station that day...

324
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:09,708
everything would
have been fine...

325
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:11,750
Everyone's hurting--

326
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:14,416
Haruka!

327
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,166
Haruka! Wake up!

328
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:47,333
Are you better?

329
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:59,708
She's... She's my only sister.

330
00:23:31,791 --> 00:23:33,000
It's so cold.

331
00:23:33,083 --> 00:23:35,000
Just don't pass out.

332
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:37,416
Ayu, you can't do this now!

333
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,041
I, uh, wonder when they're
gonna come rescue us?

334
00:23:40,125 --> 00:23:41,666
They're not coming...

335
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,625
We're only supporting actors.

336
00:23:43,708 --> 00:23:44,875
No one will even miss us.

337
00:23:44,958 --> 00:23:46,125
What!

338
00:23:46,208 --> 00:23:48,333
I'm starting to see all
kinds of weird things.

339
00:23:48,416 --> 00:23:49,458
Yeah, what kind?

340
00:23:49,541 --> 00:23:50,708
Like a belly dancer

341
00:23:50,791 --> 00:23:54,625
and particles in the air
and a slippery snake.

342
00:23:54,708 --> 00:23:57,291
Someone save me
from this nightmare!

343
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,041
You idiots!
