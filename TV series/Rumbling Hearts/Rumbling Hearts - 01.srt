1
00:01:05,375 --> 00:01:06,125
There you are.

2
00:01:06,208 --> 00:01:07,083
Hey.

3
00:01:07,166 --> 00:01:08,541
Come on. Let's go.

4
00:01:08,625 --> 00:01:10,833
What is it?

5
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:16,458
Takayuki, are you sure you
want to go to Koyou University?

6
00:01:16,541 --> 00:01:17,708
Yep.

7
00:01:17,791 --> 00:01:20,041
It's nothing but a
glorified junior college!

8
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:21,458
What about Hakuryo.

9
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:23,666
My grades aren't high
enough to stay here, man.

10
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:24,833
And I'm pretty burned out

11
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:26,291
on studying after
twelve straight years.

12
00:01:26,375 --> 00:01:28,375
A decision you'll live
to regret, my friend.

13
00:01:28,458 --> 00:01:29,750
All colleges are the same.

14
00:01:29,833 --> 00:01:31,416
Some are just more expensive.

15
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,583
Mitsuki...

16
00:01:32,666 --> 00:01:34,750
Hop out and hit the
showers. We're done.

17
00:01:42,458 --> 00:01:44,333
Hey, Mitsuki... want a towel?

18
00:01:44,416 --> 00:01:45,791
Thanks.

19
00:01:48,958 --> 00:01:52,000
I always just stand
there with my mouth open.

20
00:01:52,458 --> 00:01:53,291
Why do you do that?

21
00:01:53,375 --> 00:01:54,500
You're such a good swimmer...

22
00:01:54,583 --> 00:01:56,541
I know you'll be on
a pro team someday.

23
00:01:56,625 --> 00:01:58,125
Yeah that's what I'm hoping for.

24
00:01:58,708 --> 00:01:59,333
Yo!

25
00:01:59,416 --> 00:02:00,375
Mitsuki!

26
00:02:00,458 --> 00:02:02,750
I told you I'd
find his lazy butt.

27
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:05,541
Takayuki? Shinji...?

28
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:08,250
I didn't expect to see
you here on a Sunday!

29
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:09,500
Happy Sunday.

30
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:11,041
Yeah, why they got you
working on the weekend?

31
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:12,083
Well duh...

32
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:13,791
We got a meet coming up.

33
00:02:13,875 --> 00:02:15,541
You look ready
for the challenge.

34
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:17,625
Of course, I am.

35
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:20,333
Stop hiding!

36
00:02:20,416 --> 00:02:22,416
Hi... Takayuki... How are you?

37
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,041
Uh... I'm doing fine.

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,166
What's your deal?

39
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,750
It's not like he's
gonna bite your head off.

40
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:54,625
On a weekend?

41
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:56,791
You came out to the school
'cause you forgot a book?

42
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:59,250
Even a genius makes
mistakes sometimes.

43
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:01,166
And you dragged
poor Takayuki along?

44
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,791
No way... He just followed me.

45
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:05,791
Liar! I was having
a nice relaxing day

46
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:07,583
until you came
along and ruined it.

47
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:10,166
Aw, nothing like watching
a friendship blossom.

48
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,541
This is no friendship.

49
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:14,250
Shinji and I are in love...
Didn't you know that?

50
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:15,875
Okay, you're grossing
me out, man!

51
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:17,458
Stop trying to
hide your feelings!

52
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:19,041
Dude, cut it out!

53
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:20,958
I feel like I need
to take a shower now.

54
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:22,708
Please, Shinji,
don't be so cruel.

55
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:23,958
That's enough, man!

56
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:25,875
Okay seriously cut
it out, you guys...

57
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:28,041
You two need to work this
out when you're alone.

58
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:28,875
Oh, give me a break.

59
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,041
You know...

60
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:31,833
This lifestyle...
it doesn't offend me,

61
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:33,708
but you should consider
being more discreet.

62
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:34,875
Discreet?!

63
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:37,500
Poor Shin has such
an abrasive boyfriend.

64
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:38,416
Are you done?

65
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,208
You started the joke.

66
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,291
Yeah, I guess you're right...

67
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:44,625
I know if I get
her too worked up,

68
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:45,916
she'll start throwing punches.

69
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,375
You watch your mouth.

70
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:48,708
And I hear she hits like a guy.

71
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:49,916
Uh, Mitsuki... Can we just go--

72
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,708
You better stop flapping
those gums of yours!

73
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:52,875
 I'm just sayin'...

74
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:54,291
I mean, look at
those guns you got.

75
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:55,583
You're cut from marble.

76
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:57,166
A lot more than me
or Shinji here,

77
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,750
and we work out almost every--

78
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:02,791
What's wrong with you?!

79
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,166
You apologize to me!

80
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,583
You got three seconds, buddy!

81
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:07,208
Three--two--one--Do it!

82
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:09,208
Wait, but you were
the one who hit me!

83
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:10,791
Stop the violence!!

84
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,250
You're a dead man!

85
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:14,583
Hey, wait...

86
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:16,041
Where'd Haruka go?

87
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:19,500
I guess she must've
headed on home.

88
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:24,000
Figures! You suck!

89
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:26,375
Ow...! What is your problem??!!

90
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:28,791
Do you need medication?!

91
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:30,291
Fine, run away!

92
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:32,208
Leave me here in pain!

93
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:55,333
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

94
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:03,583
On the hill?

95
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:05,083
Yeah. Meet me there later.

96
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:07,000
I have to talk to you
about something important.

97
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:08,708
Why don't you
just talk to me now?

98
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:11,083
Because it's a private matter.

99
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,291
How important could it be?

100
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:15,500
Just be there, Takayuki.

101
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:18,125
Yeah, whatever.

102
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:27,791
Hello...? Wonderful. I'm early.

103
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,833
I wonder what's
got her so worked up.

104
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:39,833
Could it be-- Maybe she
has feelings for me...?

105
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:49,375
What are you doing here?

106
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:51,666
Um, hi, Takayuki.

107
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,125
Is Mitsuki with you?

108
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:58,000
No, she isn't...
She wanted me to, uh...

109
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,041
Oh, I get it.

110
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:02,333
She must've told you
to meet her out here, too...

111
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:05,416
Sneaky...

112
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:13,166
So... Is this your
first time up here?

113
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,208
Yeah, it is.

114
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,833
It's got a great view.

115
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:20,250
You always did like this hill.

116
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:24,833
I knew... I knew that this
was your favorite place...

117
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:26,583
You come here a lot.

118
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:31,958
Even before we met that
first time at the bookstore...

119
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:34,000
I knew you, Takayuki.

120
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:37,708
You've never been
a stranger to me.

121
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:43,250
Um, I, uh...

122
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:46,750
I like you!

123
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:50,291
I like you... I always have...

124
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:52,833
Will you go out... with me...?

125
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,208
Takayuki Narumi?

126
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:02,791
I don't know who
you're talking about.

127
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:05,541
You should. He's in your class.

128
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:08,083
He has brown hair, hazel eyes...

129
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:11,333
No way! You like this guy!

130
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,708
You got a crush!

131
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:16,708
Mitsuki! I don't
want anyone to know!

132
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:18,416
Your secret's safe.

133
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,750
But... You should tell him.

134
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:22,666
I don't think
I'm ready for that.

135
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,666
You will be someday.

136
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:37,833
Oh... Haruka...

137
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:40,291
I-I don't know
what to--I'm, uh...

138
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:47,333
I'm sorry. I shouldn't
have opened my big mouth.

139
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:05,625
Well... I'm flattered.

140
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:11,500
Let's do it... Let's go out.

141
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:39,333
Thank you...
that makes me so happy...

142
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:53,291
Yeah, I know, Mom.

143
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:55,500
I know. I'm eating fine.
Healthy as a horse.

144
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:58,416
Would you stop worrying
about me? I'm great.

145
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,666
Oh... I got another call...

146
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:02,875
Yeah, I'll call
you back tomorrow...

147
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:07,041
Of course, I'll eat dinner. Bye.

148
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,916
Hello?

149
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,250
It's me. How'd it go?

150
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:12,166
Hey, Stealth Cupid. It was fine.

151
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,958
Kill the nonchalant attitude.

152
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:15,333
I want the dirty details.

153
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:18,625
Oh. Well, uh...

154
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:21,416
Hey, she was serious, you know.

155
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,750
I mean, I hope you don't think
this is some big joke on you.

156
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:24,958
I don't.

157
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:27,458
Well, are you gonna
go out with her or not?

158
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:28,750
Mhmm.

159
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:32,416
Really? Good... I mean... Great!

160
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:36,250
Yeah, that's... that's great.

161
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:39,708
But don't string
her along? Okay?

162
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:42,333
Haruka is my friend,
and I can't let her get hurt.

163
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:43,875
You make that poor thing cry

164
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:46,500
and you'll have to
answer to me. Got it!

165
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:48,875
Yeah. Sure thing, boss.

166
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:50,791
I'm not fooling
around, Takayuki.

167
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:52,708
Hurt her and you die.

168
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:54,250
Got it.

169
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:05,750
Yeah, I know...

170
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:07,166
I got it at that
store by my house.

171
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,041
Is it any good?

172
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:09,333
Best video game I ever played!

173
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:10,416
That's for sure.

174
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,000
Hey, Takayuki...!
I didn't tell you.

175
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:14,333
I picked up that new game,
Infinitron, last night.

176
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:15,666
It's already out?

177
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,541
He was up until
sunrise playing it.

178
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:18,375
Really?

179
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:19,750
But I only got to level two.

180
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,000
Your girlfriend's waiting.

181
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:23,625
She's cute. You two walk
home together every day?

182
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:25,583
He sure does. Too bad, though.

183
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:28,333
I guess there's no Infinitron
in your future today.

184
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:30,041
Sorry,... Loverboy!

185
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:31,791
What does that
chick see in you...?

186
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:34,125
We're hotter, but she goes
right for the skinny guy.

187
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:36,333
Yeah, what's your
secret, skinny guy?

188
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:37,916
Hiro, let go of me.

189
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,291
Hold him 'til he passes out!

190
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:44,000
They were that excited
over a video game?

191
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:46,708
Yeah. It's state-of-the-art
in graphics and sound.

192
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:48,500
My computer
wouldn't even run it.

193
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:49,916
I'd have to play it at Shinji's.

194
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,125
What about you?
Do you like video games?

195
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:54,416
Not really. I like board games.

196
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,291
Oh. I guess that's cool...

197
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:57,958
Does that make me strange?

198
00:10:58,041 --> 00:11:00,708
No... What do you spend
your free time doing?

199
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:02,208
You have any hobbies?

200
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:05,208
No, I don't really do
anything I'd call a hobby.

201
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:07,250
Oh... 'kay then.

202
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,416
I'm sorry...

203
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:12,291
Put your head in the
game and focus, Mitsuki!

204
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:13,875
You can't afford
to be daydreaming!

205
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:15,791
The meet's coming up
in a few weeks.

206
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,375
I know.

207
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:19,375
You're good, but
you're not great -- yet.

208
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:20,416
Now back in the water.

209
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,083
The whole school
is counting on you.

210
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:55,625
I should hurry home.

211
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:57,583
My mom'll be getting
worried about me.

212
00:11:57,666 --> 00:11:59,250
Yeah. Sure.

213
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:00,916
I'll see you in the morning.

214
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,416
Wait...

215
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:10,791
I, uh--

216
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,791
Take this kiss upon the brow!

217
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:20,208
And, in parting from you now,

218
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:21,666
Thus much let me avow--

219
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,541
You are not wrong, who deem

220
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:25,500
That my days have been a dream;

221
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:27,291
Yet if hope has flown away

222
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:29,000
In a night, or in a day,

223
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:30,791
In a vision, or in none,

224
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,750
Is it therefore the less gone?

225
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:34,666
All that we see or seem

226
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,125
Is but a dream within a dream.

227
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:39,166
 I stand amid the roar

228
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,875
Of a surf-tormented shore,

229
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:42,166
And I hold...

230
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:47,000
You think this'll work?

231
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:48,375
Course it will...

232
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:50,500
You told Haruka he was
gonna ask her today, right?

233
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:52,750
Yeah, but I don't
think she quite got it.

234
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:55,208
She just got nervous
and ran off, as usual.

235
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,916
She's so mousy,
she needs her nerves

236
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,458
worked up every now and then.

237
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:00,958
You can say that again.

238
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:03,458
They're actually the
lamest couple in history...

239
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:05,708
Come on. How long've
they been going out now?

240
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:07,958
A while! And all they do
is walk home together...

241
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:11,625
Oh, there was that one time...

242
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:15,666
But I wouldn't call that a date.

243
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:19,375
It's time for the
afternoon walk home.

244
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:22,916
Yeah... Let's go
follow 'em, 'kay?

245
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,750
Huh...?

246
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:25,000
Come on!

247
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:26,333
Wait!

248
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,708
I feel like a stalker.

249
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:49,916
Um, I'm sorry about...
yesterday.

250
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:53,333
When you grabbed me,
I got spooked.

251
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:54,541
I didn't mean to be weird.

252
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:57,250
I'm just not used to
people getting so close.

253
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:03,666
Haruka... I was wondering?

254
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,375
Yes?

255
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:06,750
Do you like going to the movies?

256
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:09,541
Uh... Yeah...!
I go all the time.

257
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:11,416
Great... What
kinds do you like...

258
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,500
Or should I ask,
what kinds don't ya like?

259
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:16,875
Well... I don't like... Horror.

260
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:18,125
Of course not.

261
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:20,375
Even so, I've seen like
over two dozen of 'em.

262
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:22,458
But why?

263
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:30,000
My sister and I see
movies all the time.

264
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:31,250
She'll say it's a comedy,

265
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:34,000
but it always turns out
to be something scary.

266
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:36,666
I don't know why
I keep falling for it.

267
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:40,208
I bet she'll do the
same thing to me tomorrow.

268
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:42,791
I'd be more surprised
if she didn't.

269
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:44,333
Tomorrow?

270
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:45,708
My sister asked me

271
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:47,875
to go to the movies
again with her tomorrow...

272
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:51,125
She swore that it wasn't
a horror film this time.

273
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:53,083
But she lies everyday,

274
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:55,291
so I'm thinking
of turning her down.

275
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:57,208
You should go with her.

276
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,750
You can't back out if she's
looking forward to it...

277
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:03,833
Besides, you'll know
whether it's a horror flick

278
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:05,791
or not when you see the
poster at the theater.

279
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:09,666
Yeah... right...
I didn't think of that.

280
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,458
You freakin'... idiot!

281
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:17,708
Uh, I should... I gotta go.

282
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:27,500
What's wrong with you!

283
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:30,416
What the hell?

284
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,458
Where's your head?

285
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:32,250
Huh?

286
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:33,291
Don't 'huh?' us!

287
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,666
Why the heck didn't
you ask her out?

288
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:37,666
Because... She was
going with her sister.

289
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,875
She said she wasn't
going with her sister...!

290
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:41,041
She was standing there,

291
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:43,083
waiting for you to
ask her, you meathead!

292
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:45,583
Get with the program...

293
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:46,833
She's your girlfriend, chief.

294
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:48,041
You should treat her like it...

295
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:50,291
Set aside the time
for you two to be alone

296
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:51,666
and get to know her better.

297
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:52,791
You're not much of a boyfriend

298
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:54,416
if you mess with her feelings...

299
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,708
She's my friend and
I won't let you do that.

300
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:58,291
Yeah, it's not cool
to screw around

301
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:00,500
with a chick's
emotions. Trust me.

302
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:02,000
Listen, pal...

303
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:03,541
I thought you went out with
her because you liked her...

304
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:06,875
And if you do, then tell me
why you can't ever act like it.

305
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:08,458
You wouldn't understand.

306
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:11,250
Because you never understand
anyone else but you!

307
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:12,583
What are you talking about?

308
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:14,041
This has nothing to do with me!

309
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:16,916
It has everything
to do with you!!

310
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:19,625
Don't run away!

311
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:21,125
Hey...! It's not a big deal!

312
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,250
What a tool.

313
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:37,875
Hello?

314
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:40,416
Hi, it's Haruka.

315
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,708
Do you have a minute
to talk with me?

316
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:49,500
Uh, yeah. I always do.
What is it?

317
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:51,875
I have a question.

318
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:55,916
It might sound stupid,
but I need to know.

319
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,375
Do you... Do you
even like me, Takayuki?

320
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:10,250
I need to know...
I need you to tell me.

321
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:12,166
Maybe.

322
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,416
I'm sorry...

323
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:28,416
Hey, did you do the assignment?

324
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,041
Most of it.

325
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:34,125
Takayuki, right?

326
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:37,166
You're looking
for Haruka, I suppose.

327
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:43,000
Looks like somebody's
in the doghouse.

328
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:52,833
I think I'll get this one.

329
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:02,208
Tomorrow all of
you lucky students

330
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:04,250
start your summer vacation.

331
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,666
But remember to be safe.

332
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,708
You can't change the world
if you're not part of it.

333
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:12,125
You seniors who have entrance
exams and job interviews,

334
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:13,791
always take a
minute to think about

335
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:15,916
the decisions you have to make.

336
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,750
This is your time now. Take it.

337
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:20,583
Let your education
guide your choices.

338
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,500
Let your passion fuel the rest.

339
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:26,666
Walk proud. Walk forward.
Walk on, young leaders.

340
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:33,750
I thought I'd find you up here.

341
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:38,000
Mitsuki?

342
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,875
I'm gonna sit, 'kay?

343
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:43,416
Look, I don't know
if you realize,

344
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,625
but Haruka has liked you

345
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:46,750
since she first saw you
in the ninth grade.

346
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:48,833
It took her over completely.

347
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:51,458
Over the years, I've lost track

348
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:53,541
of all the guys
she's turned down,

349
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:56,208
waiting for you to be
the one to ask her --

350
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:58,000
but you never did...

351
00:18:58,083 --> 00:19:00,125
So I decided to do
my best friend a favor

352
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:01,666
and become yours...

353
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:05,416
See, it's because of her that
we've all gotten so close.

354
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,416
I knew if I sought you out

355
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,166
and became your friend,
Haruka would always be near you,

356
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,541
and that it might
bring you two together.

357
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:15,208
But along the way,

358
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:16,458
I guess I got to like
hanging out with you

359
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:18,625
and Shinji more than
I thought I would...

360
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:20,208
so much so that I forgot

361
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:23,083
why I started doing
it in the first place.

362
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:25,291
We all have her to thank.

363
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:27,583
If she'd never told me
how she felt about you,

364
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,291
none of us would have
found the dearest friends

365
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:31,250
we've ever known in our lives.

366
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:34,083
We're friends because of her...

367
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:36,666
I just thought that was
something you needed to know.

368
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:42,416
I wish I had more
to say, but that's it.

369
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,916
I'll see ya.

370
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:05,791
Haruka...! What's your deal...?!

371
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:07,125
You're too pretty to have...

372
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:09,083
What are you doing?
This is the library, Hitomi!

373
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,125
We're supposed to be quiet
while everyone's studying!

374
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:12,833
Oh, forget it!
Live on the edge, girl!

375
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:14,208
You're only young once!

376
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:20,000
No, no, no!

377
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:21,958
Figures.

378
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:44,666
I need you to come with me.

379
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:10,666
Haruka, listen...

380
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,500
I have something
I have to tell you.

381
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:16,375
It's hard for me, but--

382
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:18,000
I don't wanna hear it...!

383
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:20,000
I can't stand anymore.

384
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:21,875
I've been hurt enough

385
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:24,541
and any more might
just snap me in half.

386
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:26,375
I don't care...

387
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:29,250
I don't care if
you never... liked me...

388
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:34,375
I just... I just want
it to end... forever.

389
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,625
No more.

390
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:42,333
I'm sorry.

391
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:46,291
But... I do... I like
you very much, Haruka.

392
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:55,500
And uh... I hope
it's not too late.

393
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:57,500
But I was thinking...

394
00:21:57,583 --> 00:22:00,833
I wanna go back in time
and start over with you.

395
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,625
No...

396
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:07,041
If we did, I would have never

397
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:09,041
gotten to hear those words...

398
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:12,541
The words I've always longed
to hear from your mouth...

399
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:14,625
So let's not go back in time,

400
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:17,250
because I don't wanna
lose what we have now.

401
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:20,708
Let's just move
forward from here, okay?

402
00:23:44,166 --> 00:23:46,083
Hello? Hayase residence...

403
00:23:46,166 --> 00:23:49,541
Oh, of course, Haruka.
Hold on one second.

404
00:23:49,625 --> 00:23:51,916
Mitsuki! Telephone!

405
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,291
It's Haruka...! Mitsuki?!
