1
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:47,458
Thanks again for
bringing the flowers.

2
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:49,333
It's my pleasure.

3
00:01:54,666 --> 00:01:55,833
Thank you.

4
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:57,625
I'm so happy that
you're feeling alright...

5
00:01:57,708 --> 00:02:00,375
You look really great.

6
00:02:00,458 --> 00:02:02,708
You can make up
for the lost time.

7
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:04,291
Don't worry.

8
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:14,166
Takayuki?

9
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,458
What is it, Haruka?

10
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm so happy right now.

11
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:19,166
Huh?

12
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,708
Just being able to
spend time with you...

13
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:22,666
and seeing your smiling face...

14
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:26,666
It helps me through the day.

15
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,416
But...

16
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:32,416
Don't force yourself.

17
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,500
I mean...

18
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:37,708
Three years is a long time.

19
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:41,416
I know that life
moved on without me...

20
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:45,083
I guess I should...
start getting used to that.

21
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:47,791
Haruka.

22
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:51,541
I don't think I can handle
taking in everything at once.

23
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:54,750
Like, my brain will
explode if I try.

24
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:57,041
I want you to bring me
up to date slowly on

25
00:02:57,125 --> 00:02:59,875
what I've missed
while I've been asleep.

26
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:01,208
But...

27
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:02,708
There is something...

28
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:04,625
I'd like to know now.

29
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:08,833
It's the one question
that means the most.

30
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:10,875
What is it?

31
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:12,958
Takayuki...?

32
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:16,541
Are you seeing anyone right now?

33
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,541
No matter what your answer is...

34
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:22,333
I can handle it.

35
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:28,875
Is there anyone else...?
Please tell me.

36
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:34,958
There's no one else.

37
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:38,333
I'm single...

38
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:40,875
I'm not seeing anyone.

39
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:42,583
Honestly?

40
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:45,208
I have no reason
to lie to you, Haruka.

41
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:49,708
I see... That's good to hear.

42
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:57,166
Hey.

43
00:03:58,291 --> 00:04:00,375
So, is it true?

44
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:02,208
I said I wasn't lying.

45
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:04,666
You and Mitsuki really broke up?

46
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:26,500
Akane?

47
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:28,041
Is there something wrong?

48
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:30,083
Huh?, No, I'm fine...

49
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:33,916
I just... I completely forgot
to tell Takayuki something.

50
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,041
Oh, okay.

51
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,416
Hey, Akane.

52
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,291
Yeah?

53
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:43,625
I wonder how Mitsuki's doing.

54
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:45,291
Oh.

55
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:48,000
Do you think she's busy tonight?

56
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:50,541
It'd be great
if she could visit.

57
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:56,125
Okay.

58
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:57,458
Let's make sure the
vouchers for Ginseng Mart

59
00:04:57,541 --> 00:04:59,333
and 3G are taken care
of by the end of the day.

60
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:01,250
We also need to start
on travel arrangements.

61
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:02,500
Can you stay late today?

62
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:05,000
Sure... I'm ready to go.

63
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:20,541
You can go home if you want.

64
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:21,541
Huh? But...

65
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:24,958
I'll cover tonight...

66
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:28,666
But don't worry, you'll have
plenty to do in the morning.

67
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:34,000
Okay, thanks.

68
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:37,083
It's been a long time.

69
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:42,541
Mistuki...

70
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:52,208
Now all that's
left to do is for you

71
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:54,041
to sign on the dotted line.

72
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:55,166
Right.

73
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,875
Great... Barring
any sudden changes...

74
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:59,916
your first day on the job
will be two weeks from today...

75
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,208
I'll be in touch with you soon

76
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:03,125
about the necessary paperwork.

77
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:05,208
Thank you for the opportunity.

78
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:08,125
I'm very happy for you, son.

79
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:09,375
Thanks.

80
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:11,375
Did I hear that right...?

81
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:13,875
Takayuki's leaving
us for another job?

82
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:16,958
Wait, where're you going?

83
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:18,666
Back to work, Mayu.

84
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,791
Huh?

85
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:23,125
Why am I upset about this?

86
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:24,583
I should be thrilled...

87
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:27,875
Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!
Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

88
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:30,958
That scum sucker!

89
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:31,958
What was that?

90
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:34,125
Ah... I wouldn't
worry about her...

91
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:35,875
I think she just
has a screw loose.

92
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:37,375
Oh.

93
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:44,083
You look like a grown up now.

94
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:46,083
You think so, huh?

95
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:48,500
Well, yeah...
And I love your hair.

96
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:52,375
Oh... thanks.
It is pretty different.

97
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:54,125
I heard you've got a cool job...

98
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:55,166
You like it?

99
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:58,833
Yeah, but the
hours can be tough.

100
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:03,125
I heard something else.

101
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:04,875
Did you really...
quit swimming...

102
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:08,083
your senior year?

103
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:10,666
Oh.

104
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:13,250
Yeah... I did.

105
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,125
But, why?

106
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:19,125
Well, I guess
I just reached my limit...

107
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:21,208
And I...

108
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:23,375
Your limit?

109
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:32,250
I'm sorry.

110
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:35,000
I'll tell you the
real reason why I quit.

111
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:37,875
Huh?

112
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:41,750
Haruka... Takayuki...

113
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:46,166
And I... started dating.

114
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:50,375
I'm so sorry.

115
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:54,750
You're lying.

116
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:58,458
Please, Mitsuki...
Tell me it's a lie.

117
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:04,333
Did you know of this?

118
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:12,583
Why?

119
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:14,458
Why would you do that...?

120
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:16,791
I have to know.

121
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,500
I'm sorry...

122
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,250
It's just that after
you got in that accident

123
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:23,916
a lot of things
kind of happened.

124
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:28,875
It's over, though.
We're broken up now.

125
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:33,375
This whole thing is my fault.

126
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:36,541
Please understand...
It's not like...

127
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:38,333
I was ever in
love with Takayuki.

128
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:40,166
It wasn't like that.

129
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:43,083
How should I put this...?

130
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:45,958
Anyone would have done
it in my situation.

131
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:49,166
You have no idea
how hard it was.

132
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,750
But, don't get me wrong,

133
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:53,333
I wasn't trying to hurt you...

134
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:56,500
I was weak and
I let that control me.

135
00:08:56,583 --> 00:09:00,375
Takayuki was there,
so I went with it.

136
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:01,875
But don't worry...

137
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:05,041
I really don't have any
feelings at all for Takayuki.

138
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:15,833
Haruka. Please, forgive me.

139
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:18,416
Get out.

140
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:22,916
I said get out of my room!

141
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:40,583
I can't blame Mitsuki
for what happened.

142
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:42,125
It's me...

143
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:44,416
If I had never got
into that accident,

144
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,916
I could have been
there at his side

145
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,958
when he really needed me.

146
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,750
It's okay.

147
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:53,750
It's not fair!

148
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:55,541
It's not.

149
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:22,541
Wasn't the view from
that apartment great?

150
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,250
I just can't compete
with Haruka any longer.

151
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:41,208
Sorry I'm late.

152
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:42,791
It's about time you showed!

153
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,625
Come on, let's go.

154
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,333
Well look who it is.

155
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:51,500
Hey.

156
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:52,541
What's wrong?

157
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:54,166
You look like
you've seen a ghost.

158
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,333
Nothing.

159
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:58,458
Say, you got a minute to spare?

160
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:01,791
Well... I don't have to
be at work for another hour.

161
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:06,416
Oh really.
You wanna grab a drink?

162
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,750
Sure.

163
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:11,791
I've been running
around all morning

164
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:13,791
without any caffeine ...

165
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:15,750
I can't even think straight.

166
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:19,708
You're not even
listening to me are you?

167
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:21,083
I'm sorry.

168
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:22,666
I didn't mean to drag
you here against your will.

169
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:25,125
Oh no... I don't mind.

170
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,166
You were just standing there...

171
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,416
Is everything okay?

172
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,833
Yeah, everything's fine,
I was just daydreaming.

173
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:35,041
Cool... You looked
like a zombie though...

174
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:38,041
So, work at the hospital
is way busy now.

175
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:40,375
But that should
come as no surprise

176
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:42,125
since Hotaru's not there.

177
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:44,000
Huh?, She's still on vacation?

178
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:45,500
I thought she'd be back by now.

179
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:49,166
That's right, no one told you...

180
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,958
Hotaru quit her job at
the hospital and moved away.

181
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:56,458
Since her last day
I haven't even heard from her.

182
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:57,500
I'm sorry.

183
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:58,750
Yeah...

184
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:00,458
It really sucks because
I guess she contracted

185
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:02,958
some weird illness that
keeps her bed ridden...

186
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:05,333
She's living with her parents
now until she gets better.

187
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:07,625
Oh no. Is she gonna be alright?

188
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:10,166
Yeah, I think she's
gonna be fine...

189
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,750
She may be physically
weak right now,

190
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:14,583
but she's strong willed,
which goes a long way...

191
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:15,958
If you think about it,
she and Haruka

192
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:18,416
are kind of in the
same boat right now.

193
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:20,375
You know the feeling
where you spend

194
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:21,958
so much time with someone

195
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,666
that you take it for granted?

196
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,250
But once that person's gone

197
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:28,791
you feel a huge
hole in your heart?

198
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:30,208
Well, that's how
I feel every time

199
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,833
I step inside that hospital.

200
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:35,833
But I guess it
won't do me any good

201
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:38,375
if I try to run
away from it, huh?

202
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:40,833
Wait... I'm not the
one that's running away

203
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:42,500
from my problems...

204
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:44,250
You know...?

205
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:46,208
Gee, I wonder who
I'm referring to.

206
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,500
Well, it was bound
to happen sometime.

207
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:00,083
Morning everyone.

208
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:03,125
Good morning...
How you doing, Takayuki?

209
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:04,750
Is there something wrong?

210
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:07,166
No... I'm fine...

211
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,708
It's just gonna be
lonely here without you.

212
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:12,000
Oh.

213
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:15,000
Just a few days left
'til your new job...

214
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:16,916
We're gonna miss
all your hard work.

215
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,500
Thank you, sir.

216
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:31,541
Siberia sure is cold.

217
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:32,875
What are you talking about?

218
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:36,333
Duh...! We're talking
about your demotion!

219
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:37,708
Demotion?

220
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:40,208
You've been hired by the
suits from corporate, right?

221
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:42,166
The only place an
executive would consider

222
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:45,875
sending you is a worthless post
at the ass end of the earth.

223
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,208
I'm sure they've
put you in charge

224
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:49,250
of herding the
penguins or something.

225
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:50,666
Shepherd boy!

226
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,000
You know, I'd rather do that

227
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:53,833
than have to listen to
you for one more second...

228
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,916
Besides there are no penguins
in Siberia, you dumbass.

229
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,875
Let go! Let go! Let go! Let go!

230
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:00,375
No penguins?
What happened to them?

231
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:01,625
Penguins are from the
southern hemisphere...

232
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:04,166
Whoever told you that
they're found in the...

233
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:08,208
This is pointless.

234
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,375
There are too
penguins up there...!

235
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:13,708
Haven't you ever heard of a zoo?

236
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:15,958
You'll find plenty
of them there, stupid.

237
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:17,833
Oh crap! Mayu!

238
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:19,541
We've got eight tables waiting!

239
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:22,041
Eight tables?!

240
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:25,500
Those two are nuts.

241
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:32,875
I saw you laughing and
tickling that girl back there,

242
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:34,833
so don't try to act
like you're innocent!

243
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:39,791
I'm not the one that's
running away from my problems.

244
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:45,083
Neither am I... No way.

245
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:50,166
I'm going to
tell her everything.

246
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,208
No more deception.

247
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:01,708
She's not in there.

248
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:03,458
You just missed her.

249
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:09,583
So she's already started rehab?

250
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:10,666
Yes.

251
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:11,916
A friend of hers
visited the other day,

252
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,041
and she's really turned
it around since then.

253
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:16,833
A friend, huh?

254
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:47,666
She's a tough girl.

255
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:50,708
I haven't seen determination
like that in years.

256
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:54,958
Huh?

257
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:04,458
What's he doing here?

258
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,000
How embarrassing...

259
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:13,625
I wish you wouldn't
have seen me like that...

260
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:15,000
Pretend you didn't.

261
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:18,125
Yeah, sure... I understand...

262
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:19,750
but you know
something, Haruka...?

263
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:20,875
For someone who's been bedridden

264
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:24,166
for so long your
progress is amazing.

265
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,666
Thank you ...

266
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:28,250
All I'm doing is trying my best.

267
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:30,458
And it shows...

268
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:33,833
Really... just promise me that
you won't over exert yourself.

269
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:36,791
I can't do that.

270
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:40,333
In my entire life...

271
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:43,625
I haven't done much of
anything to be proud of...

272
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:47,250
Now it's either a hundred
and ten percent or nothing.

273
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:48,958
You've done a lot.

274
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,041
Hey, Sis...

275
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:54,333
I think it's fine if
you wanna push yourself...

276
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:55,625
just promise not to do
anything that'll make me

277
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:57,500
have to work harder, okay?

278
00:16:57,583 --> 00:17:01,458
Okay... I'll remember that.

279
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:02,958
Great.

280
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:07,958
Should we head back?

281
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:11,666
Wait, let me help you with that.

282
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:12,875
I'll do it.

283
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:14,625
Don't worry. I can manage it.

284
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:18,000
But thank you.

285
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:22,750
See ya later.

286
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,041
Hey, Akane.

287
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:57,916
Hey, are you waiting
here to see Haruka?

288
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,958
Uh, no. I was just sitting here.

289
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:04,208
Really? You must be bored.

290
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:12,333
Mitsuki came by the
hospital about a week ago.

291
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:13,541
Who?

292
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:16,083
Your ex-girlfriend.

293
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:18,083
She was here?

294
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:19,541
She came by and...

295
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:21,416
talked with Haruka.

296
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:26,166
Oh... So that's why...
she started rehab.

297
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:32,625
It makes sense... I had no idea.

298
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:37,125
Haruka's stronger than
I ever imagined her to be.

299
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:39,333
The girl I knew
before the accident was

300
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:42,083
so shy and fragile.

301
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:43,958
The type of girl
that'd be scared of a bee

302
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:46,083
and could never harm a fly.

303
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:47,416
I always used to
think that she was

304
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,458
in a constant
state of daydreaming,

305
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:52,041
totally disconnected
from reality.

306
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:54,416
But watching her try to
learn how to walk again,

307
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,833
drenched in sweat.

308
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:57,500
That just blew me away.

309
00:18:57,583 --> 00:18:58,666
Ever since she woke up

310
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,541
she's been an
entirely different person.

311
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:03,250
Is that what you really think?

312
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:04,708
Huh?

313
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:26,000
Move! I said move!

314
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:31,458
Why?! They're my legs dammit!

315
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:33,583
Why won't they move?!

316
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:36,083
How am I supposed
to live my life

317
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:38,833
without being able to walk?!

318
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:40,416
How can I ask him
to be by my side...

319
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,666
when I'm so helpless...?!

320
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:46,000
I lost three whole years...

321
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:50,458
I hate this! It's not fair!

322
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:56,250
Why did this have
to happen to me...?

323
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:59,333
What did I do
to deserve this...?

324
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:04,833
I just want my life back!

325
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,000
It still really hurts me...

326
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:24,458
how nice you always are.

327
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:25,708
You're like a disease.

328
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:27,958
Everyone you surround
yourself with suffers.

329
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:32,458
I trust you can take
care of yourself now, right?

330
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:41,500
I'm not the one that's
running away from my problems.

331
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:47,166
I'm... I'm so stupid.

332
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:59,083
Dammit... Dammit!

333
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:03,333
Dammit!!!

334
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:22,458
Keep it up, Haruka!

335
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:24,250
You're almost to the end.

336
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:33,041
Hey.

337
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,875
Hi, Takayuki.

338
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:40,625
Why are you here...?

339
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:43,333
Don't you have work?

340
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:45,166
I need to talk to
you about something...

341
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,333
Is that okay?

342
00:23:33,708 --> 00:23:35,166
Dumped, all alone after trying

343
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,333
to handle two women.

344
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:38,375
I'm free!

345
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:39,625
He prattled along blindly.

346
00:23:39,708 --> 00:23:42,750
And ended up in
the hospital himself.

347
00:23:42,833 --> 00:23:44,291
Don't stop! Keep going!

348
00:23:44,375 --> 00:23:45,541
I can't keep going, dummy.

349
00:23:45,625 --> 00:23:46,833
That was the end.

350
00:23:46,916 --> 00:23:48,291
And it's the
most fabulous ending

351
00:23:48,375 --> 00:23:50,291
for a stupid
blockhead jerk like him!

352
00:23:52,291 --> 00:23:53,583
Quit yapping that trap of yours!

353
00:23:53,666 --> 00:23:54,750
I'm sick of hearing it!

354
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:55,666
Just breathe!

355
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:57,208
Mayu! Help me!

356
00:23:57,291 --> 00:23:58,791
Good job! Come on,
teach that girl a lesson!

357
00:23:58,875 --> 00:23:59,875
Go, Takayuki! I can do it!

358
00:23:59,958 --> 00:24:01,416
Don't miss the final episode!
