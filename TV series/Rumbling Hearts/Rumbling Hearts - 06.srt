1
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:45,250
No way! Seriously?!

2
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:46,333
I'm totally serious!

3
00:01:46,416 --> 00:01:47,625
Here we are swimming
our butts off

4
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:49,291
during a pivotal meet
and there's our coach

5
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:51,583
snoring away like
my asthmatic grandpa!

6
00:01:51,666 --> 00:01:53,291
I can't believe he did that.

7
00:01:53,375 --> 00:01:54,416
Yeah, neither can I!

8
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,041
Look out!

9
00:01:56,791 --> 00:01:57,708
Hey, Mitsuki...!

10
00:01:57,791 --> 00:01:59,291
What's going on,
ya human dolphin?

11
00:01:59,375 --> 00:02:00,458
Akane!

12
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:01,958
Geez, sis. Was that necessary?

13
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:03,291
You really scared me.

14
00:02:03,375 --> 00:02:05,458
So I wanted to tell you
something, Mitsuki...

15
00:02:05,541 --> 00:02:08,083
I made some modifications to
my upstroke over the weekend.

16
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:09,916
Uh...? Your upstroke?

17
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,416
I watched the video of you

18
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,833
from last week's meet
and analyzed it myself.

19
00:02:13,916 --> 00:02:15,291
Video?

20
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:17,208
Yeah, I love the way your
arms glide over the surface.

21
00:02:17,291 --> 00:02:19,416
It's not only graceful
it's the key to winning.

22
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,333
Your form is just so perfect...

23
00:02:21,416 --> 00:02:23,000
With that image
burned into my memory,

24
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:25,375
nothing can stop
me from dominating!

25
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:26,708
Huh, where'd you see this video?

26
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:28,250
I didn't know
someone had taped me.

27
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:30,750
Well my sister had the video
camera out and I just...

28
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:32,291
I told you not to tell!

29
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:33,541
Oops! Sorry.

30
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:34,916
Geez, thanks a lot ...

31
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,250
Didn't I tell you
how embarrassed

32
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:37,708
I get when I'm on tape?

33
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:40,458
Akane was so insistent about it.

34
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:42,000
She wouldn't let it go.

35
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:45,083
Then I asked the coach if it
would be okay and he... Sorry.

36
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:46,291
Oh well...

37
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,416
I guess you can kiss
our friendship goodbye.

38
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:52,541
Fine then, see if I care.

39
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:56,875
Okay... sis, Mitsuki...

40
00:02:56,958 --> 00:03:03,625
I'm sorry... I never...
I never... intended...

41
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:06,375
for you guys...
to fight about this.

42
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:15,458
Akane...
You totally fell for it!

43
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:18,541
I don't think it's
possible for Haruka

44
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:19,750
and I to fight about anything.

45
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:21,791
We were just messing with ya.

46
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:24,458
Huh?

47
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:31,583
You guys suck!

48
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:35,208
Oh come on,
can't you take a joke?

49
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:51,833
Mitsuki!

50
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:53,708
What are you doing?
We have to go.

51
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:55,041
I'm coming.

52
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:18,541
What a gorgeous day.

53
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:19,750
Akane.

54
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:22,166
Yeah? Do you need me
to get you something?

55
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:25,916
I hope Takayuki visits today...
I miss him.

56
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,625
You think he'll come?

57
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:30,500
I don't know if he'll make it.

58
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:33,041
He's gotta study for his
entrance exams, remember?

59
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:34,916
Yeah, I know that...

60
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,083
It would just nice
if he came to visit.

61
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:41,791
Oh, I almost forgot...

62
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:43,041
I need to change out the water

63
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:44,833
for the flowers before
they start to wilt...

64
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:46,125
I'll be back.

65
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:20,208
So are you...
still gonna visit her?

66
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:21,833
Yeah.

67
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:23,166
Oh.

68
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,583
I just feel... obligated to her.

69
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:28,916
So when she
recovers completely...

70
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,333
I was wondering...

71
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:34,041
if you were gonna fill her
in on our relationship?

72
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,916
Yeah I... plan to.

73
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,583
Alright... I was just...

74
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:42,708
Everything's gonna
turn out okay, right?

75
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:48,916
I happened to walk past school
during a sales call today.

76
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,166
Peeked inside and
I barely recognized it.

77
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,583
Everything is changing

78
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:55,416
so much right before our eyes...

79
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,541
So much has happened recently...

80
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:59,791
So much it's hard
to keep up with.

81
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:04,291
I can't even begin to
wrap my brain around it.

82
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:07,666
That's funny,
because I feel the same.

83
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:11,333
I'm so happy
I have you, Takayuki.

84
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:13,333
You're all I've got.

85
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:21,666
It's gonna be alright.

86
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:24,250
Baby.

87
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:35,750
We're gonna get through this.

88
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:40,250
I love you... so much.

89
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,125
People can be so
gross sometimes...

90
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,041
I'll just pretend
I didn't see this.

91
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:01,333
I wish this place would
open their pockets

92
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:03,500
and hire a busser to
do this crappy job...

93
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:05,833
But no they're too cheap.

94
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:07,666
Hey... let... go of me!

95
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,000
Where do you think you're going?

96
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:10,583
I'm gonna go wherever
my feet take me!

97
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:12,291
Your feet can take
you wherever you want,

98
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:14,583
but only after you
clear table three. Got it?

99
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:15,916
Why don't you
clear it yourself?!

100
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,208
Okay then... Come with me.

101
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:21,166
What are you doing?
Stop torturing me!

102
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,916
You want me to
do it myself, huh?

103
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,041
Why should I do that?

104
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:25,916
You haven't cleared
one table all day!

105
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,958
Let go of me!

106
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:29,541
Now clear table three.

107
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:31,916
Over my dead body.

108
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,291
Be careful there, Takayuki...

109
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:35,833
You don't wanna pull
her face off.

110
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:38,291
If that's what it takes to
get her to work then so be it.

111
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:39,458
Shut up!

112
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:40,791
Takayuki?

113
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:42,125
Yes, sir?

114
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:43,791
I see that you're
working hard today.

115
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:45,500
Oh right.

116
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:46,666
Sorry.

117
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:47,541
I wanted to talk to
you about something

118
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:49,583
if you can spare a minute.

119
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:52,833
I asked Mayu to
clear some tables,

120
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:54,416
but I guess that's
too much for her...

121
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,208
Ayu, you're obviously
not doing anything.

122
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:58,333
Would you help your
friend at table three?

123
00:07:58,416 --> 00:07:59,708
Huh?

124
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:01,916
I said, would you please
clear table three with Mayu?

125
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,375
Yeah, yeah.

126
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:05,416
You heard the man,
take care of table three!

127
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,750
Listen... don't push me...

128
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:09,791
or you'll get a stinky
gift from my cat.

129
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:11,750
Take care of table three.

130
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:13,083
Cram it!

131
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:14,500
So, what was it you
wanted to talk to me about?

132
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:16,291
Right, Chen just called in sick,

133
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:18,541
so we're gonna be understaffed
for the dinner rush...

134
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:21,083
I was hoping you'd be
able to work a double.

135
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:22,291
Tonight?

136
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:24,625
Yeah, can ya help me out?

137
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,208
Sorry, but tonight's
no good. I have plans.

138
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:29,625
Plans? He wishes.

139
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:32,916
Do it. I dare ya.

140
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,208
Hey, you filthy bum loser...!

141
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:36,708
Why don't ya put in
some decent hours of work!

142
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:39,333
Speak for yourself, you slacker!

143
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:40,166
Man.

144
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,208
Takayuki.

145
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:42,583
Why don't you
just take the plunge

146
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:44,416
and start working
full time here...?

147
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,583
Everybody knows
you're the only one

148
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:47,875
that can handle
that lazy, little brat.

149
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,500
Well look who's
here... Takayuki.

150
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:10,666
Hello.

151
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:13,791
I guess I'll see you
in the morning then.

152
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:15,416
Fine.

153
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:19,583
Stop wasting your time here.

154
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:24,083
Is something the matter?

155
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:29,000
No everything's fine...
How's Haruka doing today?

156
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:31,791
Well... Physically
she's doing fine.

157
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:33,375
What about her memory?

158
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:36,583
That's going to take
some time, unfortunately...

159
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:39,791
However she does remember that
you visited her a few days ago.

160
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:41,458
That's good... isn't it?

161
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:56,125
Haruka.

162
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,416
Takayuki, hi!

163
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,583
I wanted to see you.

164
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:08,875
So how are you feeling?

165
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:14,583
Um... Okay... the days
seem to go by quickly ...

166
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:16,291
I thought it was
morning a minute ago

167
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:18,833
and then the next thing
I know the sun is going down.

168
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:21,500
Soon it will be nighttime,
then in a blink of an eye,...

169
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:24,083
It'll be morning again...

170
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,375
It's kinda... scary.

171
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:37,166
You're so very warm...
and reassuring.

172
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:42,250
Haruka, I was wondering...

173
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:45,041
Hey... let's make our wish.

174
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:48,625
You remember?

175
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,583
Like the brightest stars
in the darkest skies of night.

176
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:55,375
Hearts that have truly
joined will never fade.

177
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:57,708
Haruka...

178
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:06,458
Haruka... Let's focus on
you getting better first.

179
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:10,708
It's scary... the days
go by so quickly now.

180
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,916
We wanted to
thank you, Takayuki...

181
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,583
I didn't think you would ever
want to visit Haruka again.

182
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:37,291
You're so kind, Takayuki.

183
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,458
If it's alright with you...

184
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:43,250
we'd like you to
continue visiting Haruka...

185
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:45,583
It seems like whenever
she talks it's always

186
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:47,666
about how great you
are and how much...

187
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,500
she misses you.

188
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:53,208
The doctor said
her memory lapses

189
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:54,833
will start to decrease...

190
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:56,750
but in order for
that to happen...

191
00:11:57,833 --> 00:11:59,333
This isn't easy for me,

192
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:01,666
but I'd like to apologize for
the way I treated you before...

193
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:04,458
I know I asked you
not to ever visit again.

194
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:06,208
Our daughter...

195
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:08,208
she really needs your
support right now, son.

196
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:09,708
More than you know.

197
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:11,708
So please continue seeing her.

198
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:14,041
Whatever time you
can spare would be fine.

199
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:16,333
Please.

200
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:27,583
I'll visit her every day
until she wakes up.

201
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:31,333
I promise. It's the
least I can do for her.

202
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:33,833
Haruka's the most
important person in my life.

203
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:38,000
Or she was, then.

204
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:45,208
Hey, sweetheart!

205
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:46,750
Hey, babe.

206
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,625
That was really good.
Thank you for cooking.

207
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:55,791
Huh...? Oh, thanks...

208
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:58,125
Glad you liked it...
How 'bout some tea?

209
00:12:58,208 --> 00:12:59,458
Sure.

210
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:05,958
So tell me how it went.
Is Haruka okay?

211
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:08,000
I think she's doing
pretty well considering.

212
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:10,791
Was she able to remember
that it was your second visit?

213
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:13,625
Yeah... I guess
you could say that.

214
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:15,583
That's a step in
the right direction...

215
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:17,291
What about me?

216
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:20,333
Oh, of course she
remembered you, sweetie...

217
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:21,666
As a matter of fact,

218
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,500
she asked why you weren't
there to visit with me.

219
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:27,875
Oh.

220
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,208
Here you go, babe.

221
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:39,541
Oh, thanks.

222
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,875
By the way... don't you
have to get home soon...?

223
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:52,791
You have an early
start tomorrow, right?

224
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:54,416
I'll walk you home if you want.

225
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,708
I was planning on
staying the night here.

226
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:02,208
Okay, yeah. That's cool.

227
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:03,791
'Kay then.

228
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:13,083
That teacher's boring as hell.

229
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:14,125
Tell me about it.

230
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:17,083
Takayuki!

231
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:18,875
Yo, Shinji!

232
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:22,666
Sorry you had to come
all the way over here.

233
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,916
It's hard to get away with all
these classes during the day.

234
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,416
Don't sweat it, man.

235
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,875
I'm not doing
anything important.

236
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:29,041
So no work today?

237
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:30,750
I'm off.

238
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:32,083
Sweet.

239
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:34,000
Hey, Miki! Over here!

240
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:36,291
You going to Philosophy today?

241
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,625
Yeah, probably.

242
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:40,166
Awesome. I'll see you there.

243
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:45,000
Damn, she's cute, man...

244
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:46,458
Is that the girl you
were telling me about

245
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:47,750
the last time we hung out?

246
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:49,083
Yeah!

247
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:50,500
Is she the one who stood
you up on Saturday night?

248
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:51,583
Yeah.

249
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:52,750
You think she likes you?

250
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:54,250
Of course she does!

251
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:57,875
I mean... I hope that she does.

252
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:02,625
If you really like her...
then go for it.

253
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:08,166
That sucks.

254
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,291
So I guess she's far from
a full recovery, huh?

255
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:12,166
Yeah.

256
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,916
So are you still gonna
go visit her, like before?

257
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,458
I feel it's my
responsibility to.

258
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,833
Is it just a
responsibility you feel?

259
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:21,750
Or are you still
in love with her?

260
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:23,166
No, I'm not.

261
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,000
You sure about that?

262
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:26,833
Yes.

263
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:28,125
Then good...

264
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:29,833
Just don't betray
Mitsuki, okay...?

265
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:31,000
You have something
really great going

266
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:32,916
with her and you
don't wanna screw it up.

267
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,125
I know that.

268
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:35,500
This must be hard on you, bro,

269
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:37,666
but try to smile when
you're around Mitsuki.

270
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,333
Right.

271
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:42,458
So, uh, tell me...
Do you love her?

272
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:45,166
Yeah, very much.

273
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:00,166
Hazawa Trading, can I help you?

274
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:02,250
Hi, Hiro.

275
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:04,500
Did you happen to get those
contracts I faxed you...?

276
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:07,208
Right... I need it
initialed on the first page

277
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:08,625
and signed on the last...

278
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:11,583
Great. I'll be looking for
it by the end of the day.

279
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:37,875
Look who it is.

280
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:39,666
The backstabbing bitch.

281
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,083
Akane, look...

282
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,958
My sister's resting now
so she can't take any guests.

283
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:45,333
I see.

284
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:47,583
I can't believe you have
the nerve to show up here...

285
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:49,708
especially after what I said.

286
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:51,833
Actually that's what
I wanted to talk to you about.

287
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:53,208
Oh really?

288
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:55,250
Well, if it's about Takayuki
I don't want to hear it.

289
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:56,916
So don't bother.

290
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,500
It's okay if you don't
understand everything.

291
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:00,583
I was just hoping I could be

292
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:02,375
a hundred percent
honest with you.

293
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:04,083
I don't believe you.

294
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:06,708
You think you can just walk
between the raindrops...?

295
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:08,375
You can't just say
whatever you want

296
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:10,041
and be rid of the
guilt and the pain.

297
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:11,958
You're not getting
off that easy!

298
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:15,125
I never knew a human
being could be so selfish!

299
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:16,125
But you're wrong...

300
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:17,291
I'm not a selfish person--

301
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:18,291
Get out of my sight!

302
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:19,625
And don't come back

303
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:21,250
until you've really felt
what it's like to suffer.

304
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:23,500
Now leave before
I call security!

305
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:26,000
I said get out of here!

306
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:47,750
Akane?

307
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:51,000
What's going on? Are you okay?

308
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:52,291
I'm fine.

309
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:56,416
You really don't know
when to quit do you?

310
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,208
Why come here when you have

311
00:17:58,291 --> 00:18:02,083
no feelings for her...?
I don't get it.

312
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:13,416
Takayuki.

313
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,125
Hi, Takayuki.

314
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:25,791
It's about time you showed up.

315
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:27,916
Look, it's the boyfriend.

316
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,291
Sorry, I didn't mean
to interrupt you guys.

317
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:31,833
I'll wait outside
until you're done.

318
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:33,458
Actually we just finished now...

319
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:34,791
You have good timing.

320
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:37,416
Haruka's doing especially
well this evening.

321
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,666
Isn't that right, dear?

322
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:39,875
I am.

323
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:40,958
Buh-bye.

324
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:43,041
See you later, boyfriend.

325
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:45,916
Take good care of her, please.

326
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:53,458
Takayuki?

327
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:55,791
Come over here by me.

328
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:04,625
And don't come back

329
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:06,458
until you've really felt
what it's like to suffer.

330
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:14,375
What?

331
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:16,708
No, I didn't! That's not true.

332
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:17,791
That's not what I heard.

333
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:19,041
Mitsuki told me so.

334
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:20,958
She said that you wore
cute boots to gym class

335
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:22,666
even though the teacher
told you not to.

336
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:25,166
I can't believe she told you...

337
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:27,583
She promised me she
would keep it a secret.

338
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,375
So you really did run
the fifty-meter dash

339
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:30,750
in crocodile skin boots?

340
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:32,666
I only did it because
it had rained that morning.

341
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,958
Didn't you have running
shoes in your locker

342
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,375
that you could've changed into?

343
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:38,333
There wasn't any
time to change...

344
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:39,791
Stop teasing me already.

345
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:41,583
You're starting to embarrass me.

346
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:42,666
You know this story

347
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,250
was quite famous
back in high school...

348
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:45,708
I never would have imagined

349
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,583
that it was you
who did it though.

350
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:50,125
Takayuki, please
stop laughing at me.

351
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:51,916
Oh, I'm sorry.

352
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,041
But...

353
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:58,125
I'm happy...
I love to watch you smile.

354
00:19:58,208 --> 00:20:00,000
It makes me feel so good.

355
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:01,166
Haruka.

356
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:08,125
Are you still studying
for the entrance exams...?

357
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:09,375
Any progress?

358
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:12,083
Um, yeah... Slowly, but surely.

359
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:15,416
Huh... I would like
to start studying soon

360
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,333
just to get my brain working.

361
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:18,666
I'm starting to get anxious

362
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,833
being stuck in this
bed all the time.

363
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:23,041
You'll be fine.
You just have to be patient.

364
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:26,375
It's important that your
body fully heals first.

365
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,833
Yeah... I understand...

366
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:32,250
I'm really glad you could
come and hang out with me.

367
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:36,000
Would you like to do
the wish together again?

368
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:37,958
Uh, sure.

369
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:40,125
Say it with me?

370
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:43,125
Did you forget it?

371
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:46,958
No.

372
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:51,000
Is something wrong...? You okay?

373
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:04,208
Alright... I'm ready
to go when you are.

374
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:13,500
Like the brightest stars in
the darkest skies of night...

375
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:17,083
Hearts that have truly
joined will never fade.

376
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:20,458
Even if these hands
ever pull apart...

377
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:24,166
The connection between
us will never be betrayed.

378
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:57,291
It's gonna be alright.

379
00:23:32,166 --> 00:23:35,625
Like the brightest stars in the
darkest skies of night...

380
00:23:35,708 --> 00:23:39,333
Like the brightest stars in
the darkest skies of night...

381
00:23:39,416 --> 00:23:43,208
Hearts that have truly
joined will never fade.

382
00:23:43,291 --> 00:23:47,208
Even, if these hands
ever pull apart...

383
00:23:48,625 --> 00:23:53,333
We will not forget the
love we have in our lives.

384
00:23:56,083 --> 00:23:58,000
May the stars in the sky...

385
00:23:58,083 --> 00:24:00,916
Shine bright forever.
