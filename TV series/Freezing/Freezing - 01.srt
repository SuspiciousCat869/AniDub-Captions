1
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:01,291
Volt Texture...

2
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:02,791
Equip.

3
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,333
Medics to Blocks
8, 7 and 5, stat...!

4
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:51,000
Collect all wounded

5
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:54,416
and transport them
to the recovery center!

6
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:58,458
The second year's strongest four
are about to go head-to head.

7
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:00,583
The Carnival's grand finale...

8
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:03,208
This should be a hell of a show.

9
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:04,750
This semester's
top-ranked student

10
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:09,375
is currently being transported
from Block 11 to Block 12.

11
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:11,083
We still haven't seen
the top student yet?

12
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:12,333
So you've been saving

13
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:15,625
the best for last,
have you, Sister Margaret?

14
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:18,291
Perhaps.

15
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,250
Rank 1 is surrounded.

16
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:49,916
Six contestants closing in...
seven... eight... eleven total.

17
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,541
I realize these
matches are designed

18
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:53,750
to simulate real
battle conditions,

19
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:56,083
but this year's Carnival
is something else.

20
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:58,000
Can't say I've ever
seen one Pandora face

21
00:05:58,083 --> 00:05:59,833
so many opponents at once.

22
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:01,708
It's not the sort of
thing you expect to see

23
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:03,625
from a second-year student...

24
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:05,041
...that's for sure.

25
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:11,583
Now deploying... Volt Weapon.

26
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,291
It's time for battle,
Nova Blood.

27
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,750
Three down... Now another two.

28
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:48,125
Rank 1 has eliminated
nine opponents.

29
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,166
The Untouchable Queen...

30
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,958
That is the title the
students have given her.

31
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:58,916
Although you may know her
as Satellizer el Bridget...

32
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,291
Bridget?

33
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:09,916
You don't mean that Bridget...

34
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,208
None other.

35
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:13,916
"Untouchable Queen"
is a rather odd nickname.

36
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,458
I think it will
make sense soon enough.

37
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,166
The fifth, fourth and
third-ranking students

38
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:22,458
are currently
en route to Block 3.

39
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,291
I'm bringing in the injured.

40
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:26,083
Are you ready?

41
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:27,541
Ready!

42
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:29,666
As you may know, the East
and West Genetics Academies

43
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,416
were founded as institutes

44
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,041
to prepare all
Pandora for their battle

45
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:36,916
against the extra-dimensional
creatures known as Nova.

46
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,166
You know all about
Pandora, I'm sure,

47
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,500
but let's cover the basics.

48
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,375
Kaho Hiiragi!
Is learning about the fate

49
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:46,458
of the world really
that boring to you?

50
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:48,375
Uh... No! I mean...

51
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:50,666
No, ma'am! Not at all!

52
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,333
In that case,
since you're a Pandora,

53
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:53,916
why don't you
tell us about them?

54
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,166
We Pandora are implanted
with Stigmata that give us

55
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:00,458
the power to equip Volt Textures
and deploy Volt Weapons.

56
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:02,791
That's what we use
to combat the Nova.

57
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:06,750
And what else... in addition
to our Volt equipment,

58
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:07,916
the Stigmata also give us

59
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,625
increased agility
and strength...

60
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:12,250
As far as the basics go,
I guess that's about it.

61
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:16,333
Well spoken for a first
year--you can take your seat.

62
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:19,083
The Stigmata also give their
user healing abilities...

63
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:20,875
They can reconstruct
a Pandora's body

64
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:23,125
by using her DNA as a guide.

65
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:25,000
Administer the
activating solution...!

66
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:27,000
If the Stigmata doesn't
activate quickly enough...

67
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:30,208
these injuries may
not heal properly!

68
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,875
Start neural array expansion
and optimization now!

69
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:37,125
Yes, Doctor Elise!

70
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:38,958
I don't want to see any
deaths at this Carnival!

71
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:40,583
Neural integration complete.

72
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:42,583
Synapse signal
transmission normal.

73
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:45,625
I need 1,000
milligrams of Savitcam.

74
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:46,833
In extreme cases,

75
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:48,875
like when a Pandora
loses one of her limbs,

76
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:52,500
the Stigmata can grow a new
one without even leaving a scar.

77
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:53,583
I would know...

78
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:56,333
Four years ago,
I experienced it myself.

79
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:58,083
Miss Yumi?

80
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:00,750
Yes? What is it, Arthur?

81
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:02,083
Before you became a teacher,

82
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,416
you were a Pandora
like the girls here, right...?

83
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,875
Could you tell us a little
bit about how that went?

84
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:08,708
Oh! I wanna know, too!

85
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:10,708
Me too! Yeah, me too!

86
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:12,708
You said you were
hurt four years ago...

87
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:14,333
I did the math and
that means you took part

88
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:15,875
in the Eighth Nova Clash...

89
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:19,208
That's when the Nova Type S
showed up in Japan, isn't it?

90
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:27,666
It was the Eighth Nova Clash...

91
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,166
Once again, the extra
dimensional creatures

92
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,875
entered our world...

93
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:33,833
Leaving nothing but
destruction in their wake.

94
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:36,208
Nova Type S detected
in the Uraga Channel...

95
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:40,416
Freezing initiated.
Radius: 220 meters.

96
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:46,791
All vessels in the area
have ceased movement!

97
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:57,083
Lost contact with all vessels!

98
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:58,791
At its current speed,
the Type S is expected

99
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:01,791
to reach Tokyo Bay
in 20 minutes.

100
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:08,458
We will encounter
the Nova in 20 minutes.

101
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:12,000
At Genetics we learned all
the skills we need to fight...

102
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:14,500
Now is the time to
put them to the test.

103
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:15,833
Yes, ma'am!

104
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:17,958
Yumi.

105
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:19,958
What is it? Where's Kazuha?

106
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:21,250
Back home...

107
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:23,583
She had something
to take care of first.

108
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:25,125
I see.

109
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:31,000
Of course... we fought
with all our strength,

110
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:33,125
but in the end,
it amounted to nothing...

111
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:37,000
It wasn't us who defeated
the Nova that day...

112
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:41,958
It was all her... Kazuha Aoi.

113
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:52,083
Kazuha! Kazuha!

114
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:56,791
Kazuya!

115
00:10:56,875 --> 00:11:00,583
Don't go...! I can't lose you!

116
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:03,708
You're my only sister!

117
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:05,083
I need you!

118
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:07,375
What if those things kill you?!

119
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:11,541
Don't worry,
I promise I won't die...

120
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:16,916
I have something
special to protect me.

121
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:20,458
It's not just Stigmata
that I carry on my back...

122
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:23,500
I carry all of your
hopes and dreams as well.

123
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:27,666
We Pandora carry the hopes
and dreams of the whole world

124
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:30,666
because we're the only ones
who can defeat the Nova...

125
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:33,916
And all of those hopes,
give me strength...

126
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,708
That's why...
I promise I won't lose.

127
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:42,291
And that was the last time
I ever saw my sister...

128
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:44,041
Kazuha.

129
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,625
So long, sis. Wish me luck.

130
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,208
Hi, I'm Chiffon Fairchild,

131
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:09,583
the Student Council
President at West Genetics.

132
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:11,000
Uh, hi...!

133
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,500
Is something troubling you...?

134
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:14,833
No.

135
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:16,458
Then let me tell you a
little about the school...

136
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:17,666
I'd sure hate for you

137
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,291
to have a tough time
on your first day there.

138
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:20,500
Thanks.

139
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:22,250
All the second year
Pandoras will be looking

140
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:24,083
for partners among
the underclassmen,

141
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:26,625
so one of them might
ask you to be their Limiter.

142
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:28,625
Why do they pick
from the underclassmen?

143
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:32,333
An excellent question.
It's the Ereinbar.

144
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:34,208
The... what?

145
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:39,166
It's a little-understood
sensory organ buried deep

146
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,583
within the brain,

147
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:43,083
controlling sight, smell,
hearing, taste and touch.

148
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:45,541
When the Limiter and
Pandora synchronize in battle,

149
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:49,750
they share their Ereinbar...
making their five senses one.

150
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,750
Compatibility rates
differ between partners,

151
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:55,708
but younger boys tend
to do best overall.

152
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:57,250
So, there you have it...!

153
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:59,291
That's why Pandoras
always pick underclassmen

154
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:01,083
when they're
looking for a Limiter!

155
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:04,125
By the way, when a Pandora and
Limiter share their Ereinbar...

156
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:06,083
it's called an Ereinbar Set.

157
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:08,208
I wonder what that's like...

158
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,458
Activate Ereinbar Set!

159
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:18,625
Freezing!

160
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:24,458
Freezing areas are set.

161
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:26,166
Two minutes remaining!

162
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:30,125
Volt Weapon: Deploy!

163
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:36,625
No turning back now.

164
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:39,291
Let's do this.

165
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:45,666
The purpose of
the Ereinbar Set is

166
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:49,125
to neutralize the
Nova's Freezing Area.

167
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:51,916
Using their Limiter to create
a Freezing Area of their own,

168
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,166
the Pandora can then act
within the Nova's range.

169
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:10,625
I can see the Nova's core!

170
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:16,708
The neutralized
zones are shrinking!

171
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:23,583
All Pandora and Limiters
re-engage Freezing Areas!

172
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:30,041
Use your Ereinbar Set, hurry!

173
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:08,625
Hold on, Yumi!

174
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:12,125
90% of Pandora vital
signs have been lost.

175
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:13,958
Alert all standby medics.

176
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:17,416
Retrieving the Pandora
is our first priority.

177
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,875
Repeat, retrieving the
Pandora is our first priority.

178
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,750
No matter how hard we train,

179
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:26,375
fighting the Nova is
always a dance with death...

180
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:29,916
yet fighting is all we can
do if we want to survive.

181
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,583
Your sister believed
that as well...

182
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:34,791
And that's why she
fought without fear

183
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:37,375
until her own dance
came to an end.

184
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:17,000
It's Kazuha!

185
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:05,458
She saved us... saved everyone.

186
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:11,958
But all we could do was watch as
she sacrificed her own life...

187
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:13,958
You mean she died.

188
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:15,458
Despite her bravery,

189
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:18,458
that was only one battle in
a war that still rages on...

190
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:20,916
And that is why we
attend this school.

191
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,166
This is Control.

192
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,291
West 2-3,
you're clear to land...

193
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:34,500
Landing zone one is
wide open. Over.

194
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:40,291
West 2-3 to Control.

195
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:41,583
We're at a nice cruising speed

196
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:43,666
and proceeding
to landing zone 1.

197
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,041
Over.

198
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:08,125
Hi! Welcome to West Genetics!

199
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:12,833
I hope you had fun on your
big field trip today, Chiffon!

200
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:14,250
I did...!

201
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:15,791
That's my friend, Ticy Phenyl.

202
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:17,291
She's on the
student council too,

203
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:19,250
so you'll prob'ly
see her around a lot.

204
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:21,833
It's so nice to meet you!

205
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:40,750
Here we go!

206
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:44,791
I got you now!

207
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:22,625
Stay back...

208
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:26,416
I won't let you or
anyone else touch me.

209
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,375
Rank 3 is incapacitated...

210
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:45,250
Three of the top five
shot down in an instant...

211
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:46,833
They didn't stand a chance...

212
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:48,625
...couldn't lay a finger on her.

213
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:51,666
I see... It's just
like you said...

214
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:56,291
I had my doubts...
but you live up to your name...

215
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:59,583
You really are
untouchable, aren't you...

216
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,375
So... she's the famous
Untouchable Queen

217
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:14,250
we've been hearing about?

218
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:18,083
Satellizer el Bridget...

219
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:21,708
I expected no less
from our top student!

220
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:24,375
However, your reign is
about to come to an end!

221
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:27,375
For today, you will know
the bitter taste of defeat.

222
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:30,250
And who shall be the
one to serve it to you?

223
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:32,708
Why, me?!
Ganessa Roland, of course...

224
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:35,083
Hey... did you hear me?

225
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:36,916
Come back here!

226
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:39,375
Chains of Binding!

227
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:41,458
The training area up
ahead is used

228
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:44,375
for what we call the
"Carnival" where the Pandoras--

229
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:48,666
No fair...

230
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:49,791
What's the point
in getting stronger

231
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:52,208
if she's just gonna
get stronger, too?

232
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:56,500
Hey...! What are you
staring at you, creep?!

233
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:59,041
I... It's nothing, sorry.

234
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:14,041
It's you, isn't it...? Kazuha!

235
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:17,750
You're still alive!

236
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:30,583
Oh no... why did he have
to grab her, of all people?

237
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:32,708
Run away, Kazuya!

238
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:38,875
Hey, wait...

239
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:40,916
Why is she acting so shy
and cutesy all of a sudden?

240
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,250
Weird, isn't it?

241
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:45,166
I missed you so much...

242
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:48,458
Don't ever leave me again!

243
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:51,791
No... let go of me!

244
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:54,000
Stop it--I said stop!

245
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:55,791
Never... Never!

246
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:02,125
A Freezing Area?!

247
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:04,291
Why? What's going on?!

248
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:07,750
This fight isn't over yet!

249
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:09,958
I can't move!

250
00:23:40,958 --> 00:23:42,625
The fact of the matter
is that I'm Rank 1

251
00:23:42,708 --> 00:23:44,250
whether you like it not!

252
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:46,708
You have no right
to touch me like that!

253
00:23:46,791 --> 00:23:48,291
You can use it, too?

254
00:23:48,375 --> 00:23:50,583
Next time: "Pandora Mode."
