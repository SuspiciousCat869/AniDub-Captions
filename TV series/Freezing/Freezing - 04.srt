1
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:33,833
So tell me, Ingrid...

2
00:00:34,916 --> 00:00:40,083
...the little girls, are
they... are they... safe?

3
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:42,208
What little girls?

4
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:43,916
The first-years...

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,708
Oh... Yeah... They
all made it out okay...

6
00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:16,958
Why, Marin?

7
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:18,333
You've served your
week in the brig...

8
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,291
You can come on out now.

9
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:43,875
Satellizer el Bridget...

10
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,458
Who are you?

11
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:52,625
Silly me, where
are my manners...?

12
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:56,416
My names Ingrid Bernstein,
you've probably heard of me.

13
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,083
Are you here to avenge
your slutty friend?

14
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:06,250
I'm known around here
as the Protector of Order.

15
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:07,583
Is that so?

16
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:10,500
I use my abilities to punish
those who sow chaos,

17
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:13,000
troublemakers like
you, for example.

18
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:21,083
As a Pandora, I defend order
with every fiber of my being.

19
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:24,208
Find yourself a Limiter
by noon tomorrow.

20
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:27,750
You will suffer for
what you've done...

21
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:30,583
You and your Limiter both.

22
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:41,750
Did I really just hear
what I think I heard?!

23
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:47,291
Wait, this isn't a joke
or something, is it?

24
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:49,791
Why on earth would I joke
about something like that?!

25
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:52,708
Ingrid is ranked seventh
among the third-year cadets...

26
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:54,833
And she's a whole lot
stronger than Miyabi.

27
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:57,208
Oh no--the Untouchable
Queen is totally gonna ask

28
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:58,500
for your help, Aoi!

29
00:04:58,583 --> 00:04:59,708
No doubt...

30
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:01,541
When she does,
you gotta tell her no!

31
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:04,541
You should make yourself scarce,
at least until tomorrow night--

32
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:31,000
I'd like you to consider
selecting me to be your Limiter.

33
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:47,208
Okay... Here goes nothing.

34
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:54,000
Satellizer? Ma'am...?

35
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:15,125
A diary?

36
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:18,791
No way...! I can't go
snooping like that!

37
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:25,958
I guess one little
peek can't hurt...

38
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:29,916
I can't do that... Not to her...

39
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:35,833
Oh, sorry, I was just, uh--

40
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:38,708
What...? What are you
doing in my room?!

41
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:43,375
No...! Get away from my diary!

42
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:02,875
I'm really sorry!
I... I didn't mean to look...!

43
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:11,083
Why did you...

44
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:12,708
...sneak into my dorm room?

45
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:15,166
I came to find
out your answer...

46
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,500
About whether or
not you'd be willing

47
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:19,500
take me as your Limiter...

48
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:21,458
What do you say?

49
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:29,416
I'll pass.

50
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,625
But--you have to fight that
third-year tomorrow, don't you?!

51
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:34,291
How do you know that?

52
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:36,041
My classmate
kind of overheard...

53
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:38,708
Look, you need a
Limiter, like right now!

54
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:41,000
Not a Limiter like you, I don't.

55
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:42,791
Huh?

56
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:46,458
Now get out.

57
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:20,916
The Pandora life is
a structured one...

58
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,500
A strict adherence to hierarchy
ensures that order is preserved,

59
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:27,708
that our lives are
not lost in vain...

60
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:30,291
But you don't think much
of preserving order...

61
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:32,625
do you, Satellizer!

62
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:36,541
All I know is, if you're a
Pandora without a Limiter,

63
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:38,500
you would do well
to face your opponent

64
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:41,708
when she doesn't
have hers, either.

65
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:43,333
Really?

66
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:51,333
You have made a grave mistake.

67
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:53,708
Just because I decided
to forgo our battle

68
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:55,791
until we both had
Limiters present

69
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:58,958
does not mean that I am
weaker than you by myself!

70
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:08,250
Well, at least you're
making this interesting.

71
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:10,416
Now deploying Volt Weapon!

72
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:13,041
Divine Trust!

73
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:16,958
I have to say, I can't wait
to see your fabled abilities

74
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:20,250
in action with my own
eyes, second-year!

75
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:31,666
How can she still hit so hard
when she's moving that fast?!

76
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:40,541
An earthquake?

77
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:41,750
Oh, you're naughty,

78
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:44,041
aren't you--who told you
I like it rough...?

79
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:46,125
What was
that sound just now?

80
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:48,625
It beats me.

81
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:12,250
Don't you even think
of giving up on me...

82
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:16,125
This fight isn't over
until I say that it's over!

83
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:21,208
I knew it would be her!

84
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:27,166
She's faster than me, and her
attacks are more powerful...!

85
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,333
There's no way I can beat her

86
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:30,625
if I treat this like
a normal fight!

87
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:33,875
Accelerator!

88
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,250
Somebody's learned an
upperclassman skill.

89
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:44,291
She disappeared!

90
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:57,583
That's even faster than
she fought last time!

91
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:12,791
I must admit, you executed
that move pretty well...

92
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:15,875
But it's a pity you only seem
to know the Accelerator Turn--

93
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:18,458
it's the most basic
speed-specialization type

94
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:20,208
at our disposal.

95
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:23,541
It's common knowledge
among the third-years...

96
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:25,416
In other words...

97
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:29,875
it's completely useless
against a Pandora like me!

98
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:31,958
Tempest Turn!

99
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:34,958
Four of her?!

100
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,625
Accelerator...!

101
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:08,500
Maybe it's a good
thing I didn't call Leo.

102
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:11,375
Don't tell me you've
passed out already...

103
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:13,750
Ingrid!

104
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:17,125
Leo?

105
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:20,083
You're not giving up, huh...?

106
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:22,250
You don't have a chance in
hell of winning this fight,

107
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:23,833
you have to know that.

108
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:27,000
I even gave you time to find a
Limiter and you ambushed me...

109
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:29,750
And that's why I'm going
to engage the Ereinbar Set

110
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:32,291
and wipe you off
the face of the Earth!

111
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:37,833
Fine, I'll give you
one last chance...

112
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:41,666
Seeing as how we're next to
the first-year boys' dormitory,

113
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:44,375
if you can find someone stupid
enough to be your Limiter,

114
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:47,750
I'll wait until the
baptism has taken place.

115
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,291
Well, boys...?

116
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:52,750
Will none of you come to the
aid of the Untouchable Queen?!

117
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,291
Looks like you're out of luck...

118
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:58,208
Now, Leo!

119
00:12:58,291 --> 00:12:59,166
Yes, ma'am!

120
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,291
Wait...! Hold on!

121
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:06,458
I accept your challenge.

122
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:09,500
I will become
Satellizer's Limiter!

123
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:14,666
I really didn't expect anybody
to come to her defense...

124
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,375
I guess it's your right...

125
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:18,916
But before you join
with her, know this...

126
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,875
She is an enemy of
hierarchy and order...

127
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:24,041
If you become
her Limiter tonight

128
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:26,000
you will share in her fate...

129
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:28,291
Are you prepared for that?

130
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:29,833
Look ma'am, I didn't
come to this school

131
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:31,958
to rock the boat, okay?

132
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:34,041
But I'll be damned if I sit back

133
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:37,500
and watch the two of you gang
up on Satellizer like this!

134
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:39,291
Why...?!

135
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:41,458
Then hurry up and
perform the baptism.

136
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:44,291
I know you don't think very
much of me, Satellizer...

137
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:45,750
But I just wanna help...

138
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:48,083
If you'll let me.

139
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:01,041
Please administer the baptism.

140
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,750
I can't.

141
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:05,166
Huh?

142
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:06,958
But... But why not?

143
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:09,166
At this rate, there's
no way you can win!.

144
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,458
Do you really
hate me that much?!

145
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:13,166
Because it's dirty...

146
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,291
So dirty that
I can't stand it...!

147
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:18,708
The sensation--it feels like
my whole body is being licked!

148
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:21,458
The Ereinbar Set,
people touching me...!

149
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:23,708
It all makes me
sick to my stomach!

150
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:24,791
Huh?

151
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:26,333
I didn't know forming
the Ereinbar Set

152
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:28,416
was really as nasty as all that.

153
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,958
Don't listen to her nonsense.

154
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:31,416
Sharing your sensory input

155
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,583
with someone does take a
little getting used to, sure,

156
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:36,500
but there's nothing
wrong about it.

157
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:40,208
Most people think of their first
Set as a sacred experience.

158
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:41,666
Leo!

159
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:42,375
Yes, ma'am!

160
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:44,041
Form the Ereinbar Set!

161
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:45,791
Yes ma'am!

162
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:53,333
Oh no!

163
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:56,458
End of the line! Satellizer!

164
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:05,958
That's impossible!

165
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:07,500
How the hell can he
cast a Freezing Area

166
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:08,875
without the baptism?!

167
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:10,208
Huh?

168
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:13,125
In that case, I had better
get rid of you first.

169
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:19,750
No...! Ingrid!

170
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:24,041
Are you all right, Ingrid?!
Say something, talk to me!

171
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:25,416
Damn you...!

172
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,250
Damn you for disrupting
the natural order of things!

173
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:29,458
How come keeping everybody else

174
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:31,500
in line is the only
thing you care about?!

175
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,458
Shut up!

176
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:40,416
You will submit!

177
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:45,875
Why is she so
obsessed with order?

178
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:48,500
You haven't figured it out?

179
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:50,083
That's Ingrid's pet cause...

180
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:52,458
She's as committed to
the idea of upholding order

181
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:55,083
as she is to her
responsibilities as a Pandora--

182
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:57,250
which is to say, very.

183
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:59,375
Hey, when did you get here?!

184
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,208
Yes, but...

185
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:03,333
there must be a
reason she's like this...

186
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:10,291
It was a just little
over a year ago

187
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:12,666
when I was a first-year
at West Genetics...

188
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:15,541
The Untouchable Queen
hadn't transferred here yet--

189
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:17,708
and a good thing
for her she hadn't.

190
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:20,125
The faculty sent us out
for an off-site Carnival

191
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:22,208
to toughen up the new girls...

192
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,625
No... Please,
I don't wanna die...

193
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:38,583
A Type S Nova appeared
out of nowhere.

194
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:42,250
Our platoon panicked
and broke formation.

195
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:54,833
The school sent in
reinforcements...

196
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:57,041
They took down the Type S.

197
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:01,958
But the platoon leader,
Marin, she didn't make it.

198
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,666
Ingrid watched her die?

199
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:14,083
Those two had always
been the best of friends--

200
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:15,750
they were pretty
much inseparable,

201
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:17,625
and I'm sure Ingrid thinks
that if the first-years

202
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:18,958
had maintained discipline

203
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:21,208
and held the line
when the Nova attacked,

204
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,625
Marin wouldn't have
died that night.

205
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:26,875
Now, Leo!

206
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:29,125
Right!

207
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,333
Let her go!

208
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:36,416
Casting an omnidirectional
Freezing is impossible...!

209
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:40,208
That little unbaptized freak has
the same abilities as a Nova?!

210
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:44,916
Okay, who is this kid,
and how does he do that?!

211
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:49,166
Hurry up and undo that little
bastard's Freezing already, Leo!

212
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,375
What are you waiting for?!

213
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:53,208
She's headed straight for you!

214
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:57,208
Run, Leo--you have
to get out of there!

215
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:01,166
Leo!

216
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,083
With her Limiter
incapacitated...

217
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:07,416
...Ingrid can't attack
or defend herself!

218
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,500
Activate...! Pandora Mode!

219
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:22,875
She's engaged her Pandora Mode?

220
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:24,708
It's a skill that allows
its user to move

221
00:18:24,791 --> 00:18:27,083
within a Freezing
field without a Limiter!

222
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:29,333
You have to be careful, Kazuya!

223
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:37,416
Marin...

224
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,666
I am doing the right
thing here, aren't I...?

225
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,875
If those first-year cowards
hadn't abandoned you

226
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:43,291
to your fate that night...

227
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:45,375
you wouldn't have
had to die in vain...

228
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,583
We'd still be together...

229
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:50,083
we'd still be fighting
side by side...

230
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:55,333
Any girl who flouts the rules
will abandon her comrades!

231
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:58,041
It is my sworn duty to make
sure that pointless deaths

232
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:00,000
like Marin's will
never happen again

233
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:03,291
by purging these
weaklings from our ranks!!

234
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:08,625
You will die...

235
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:11,750
That others may live!

236
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:19,000
It's stronger than
before, but how...?

237
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:22,541
How could you say that about
your best friend, Ingrid?

238
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:24,000
How could you even
think that Marin's death

239
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:26,166
was pointless when
we all know it wasn't!

240
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,416
You had never even heard
of her before tonight!

241
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,416
So what the hell do you know?!

242
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,916
You're right...

243
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,791
All I know about Marin is
what I've been told just now...

244
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:36,041
But still...

245
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:38,208
I could never believe
her death was pointless.

246
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:39,583
How could it have been...?

247
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:41,458
When she died,
I think she exemplified

248
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:44,000
what being a
Pandora is all about.

249
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:46,416
Shut up...

250
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,125
Shut... up!

251
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:50,916
She did not... die in vain...

252
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:53,125
Neither did my sister.

253
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:55,458
Your sister...?

254
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:57,375
That boy's Kazuya Aoi.

255
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:58,625
Aoi...?

256
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:01,375
Wait, don't tell me
your sister was...!

257
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:04,291
It's not just Stigmata
that I carry on my back...

258
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:07,291
I carry all of your
hopes and dreams as well,

259
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:10,458
because we're the only ones
who can defeat the Nova.

260
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:13,416
That's... the last thing
she ever... said to me...

261
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:15,750
I happen to agree with him.

262
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:16,875
What do you mean?

263
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:18,875
When the first-years
left Marin...

264
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:21,000
She never called them
back into formation

265
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:23,416
because she told them to run.

266
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:27,416
Marin! Why did you
send them away?!

267
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,791
You know those novice Pandoras

268
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:31,458
wouldn't even last a
minute against a Nova.

269
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:35,666
Because none of
them have a Limiter...

270
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:36,875
I can't say for sure just yet,

271
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:38,458
but I might be able
to buy 'em enough time

272
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:40,583
to make their way
back to safety.

273
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:43,458
But Marin, you
know you'll die...

274
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:49,708
Marin could have gotten away,
but she stayed behind...

275
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,250
She wanted to give
the underclassmen

276
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,458
a chance to escape,

277
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:54,875
even at the cost
of her own life.

278
00:20:56,541 --> 00:21:01,916
The little girls, are
they... are they... safe?

279
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,916
What little girls?

280
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,416
The first-years...

281
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:09,958
Oh, yeah... they
all made it out OK.

282
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:24,041
She smiled...

283
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:25,916
...because she'd
upheld the ideals

284
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,208
of Pandora life
to the very end...

285
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:32,541
My Marin... she didn't
die in vain after all.

286
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:43,416
What's that look? Gratitude?

287
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,333
Trust me, I didn't tell
her as a favor to you.

288
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:49,041
Ingrid needed to find out
at some point or another,

289
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:51,583
and this seemed as
convenient a time as any.

290
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:53,791
Ganessa--wait up!

291
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:55,458
Oh, shoot.

292
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:01,708
Looks like I owe
you another thank you.

293
00:22:01,791 --> 00:22:02,958
For what?

294
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:06,750
This is the second time
you've saved my life.

295
00:23:40,916 --> 00:23:42,375
I would be honored...

296
00:23:42,458 --> 00:23:43,583
He is Kazuya Aoi.

297
00:23:43,666 --> 00:23:44,708
...if you would come up
to my room tonight!

298
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:46,375
Fate has doubtless
brought us together.

299
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:48,541
He is my soul mate--
he and none other.

300
00:23:48,625 --> 00:23:50,458
Next time:
"She is Rana Linchen."
