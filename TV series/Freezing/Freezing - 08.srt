1
00:00:21,291 --> 00:00:24,833
Satellizer...! Rana! Ow--

2
00:00:24,916 --> 00:00:27,083
They said you are not
supposed to get out of bed yet!

3
00:00:27,166 --> 00:00:30,000
Oh... Right... Thank you.

4
00:00:30,916 --> 00:00:31,958
I'm sorry...

5
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:33,125
I wanted to help you both,

6
00:00:33,208 --> 00:00:35,208
but I only ended up
getting in your way.

7
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:37,000
You've got that right!

8
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:39,875
You entered a battle you had
no right to be a part of...!

9
00:00:39,958 --> 00:00:41,583
What did you think
you were doing?!

10
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:43,750
You just barged in without--

11
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:45,875
If you were--!

12
00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:48,541
If he had... suffered
a more serious injury...

13
00:00:48,625 --> 00:00:50,416
Kazuya was thinking of you...

14
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,000
He is a hero...

15
00:00:52,083 --> 00:00:54,625
Do you not understand that he
was trying to protect you...?

16
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:57,958
It is not right of you
to scold him for it!

17
00:01:00,625 --> 00:01:02,458
Satellizer, wait!

18
00:01:05,208 --> 00:01:07,833
I thought you were
very brave, Kazuya.

19
00:01:07,916 --> 00:01:09,791
It is simply amazing
that the more I learn

20
00:01:09,875 --> 00:01:11,458
about you the
more I find to like!

21
00:01:11,541 --> 00:01:12,166
But--

22
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:13,375
The day will surely come

23
00:01:13,458 --> 00:01:16,166
when you and I are bound
together in Baptism!

24
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,541
Baptism...? I dunno--

25
00:01:18,625 --> 00:01:19,958
I know...

26
00:01:20,041 --> 00:01:21,958
And it is all right if my
feelings are not returned.

27
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:25,125
At least that is...
for right now.

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,208
What's wrong with me?

29
00:01:30,666 --> 00:01:33,500
I was actually happy
when he tried to help, but...

30
00:01:34,916 --> 00:01:36,416
Oh, Kazuya.

31
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:10,833
Prom...? What's that?

32
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:13,000
It's a yearly event that we have
where all the students gather

33
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:15,375
in the auditorium and
dance the night away...!

34
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:16,916
I'm really looking
forward to it!

35
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,666
It used to be that
only upperclassmen

36
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,000
were allowed to attend,

37
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:22,333
but now they're letting
the first-years come, too!

38
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:23,500
It's designed to strengthen

39
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:25,083
the bonds between
existing partners...

40
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:27,541
or provide an opportunity
to find someone suitable...

41
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:29,208
That was why
they originally had it,

42
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:30,875
but it really serves
as a chance for everyone

43
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:32,750
to take a break
and have some fun!

44
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:34,958
Yeah, but you're
forgetting the best part...!

45
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:36,916
The Pandora Queen contest.

46
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,500
Pandora Queen?

47
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:40,708
It's a beauty pageant

48
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:42,250
that happens at the
end of the evening...

49
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:44,666
The winner's determined
by votes from the students.

50
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:48,166
Last year it was Miss Elizabeth
who earned the title.

51
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,833
Given her beauty
and natural grace,

52
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:52,958
I can't think of anyone more
deserving of the title "queen."

53
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:55,208
She definitely looks the part.

54
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:09,916
Yeah, you're right...

55
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,958
She really is
beautiful, isn't she?

56
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:13,291
Careful...!

57
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:15,833
You better not let you-know-who
catch you gawking.

58
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:18,625
How are things going with you
and the Untouchable Queen?

59
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:21,291
Fine... I guess.

60
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:23,458
Actually, things have
been pretty tense

61
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:24,750
since the other night...

62
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:27,208
I've hardly had a
chance to talk to her.

63
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:30,958
Really, Elizabeth...?

64
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:32,041
You're really not planning

65
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:35,291
on doing anything
about Satellizer?!

66
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:40,166
Well... both our fifth-ranked
and fourth-ranked girls

67
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,875
were unable to handle her.

68
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:42,916
Sorry.

69
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,500
We've no choice
but to face facts...

70
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:45,958
Her abilities are
clearly greater

71
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:48,458
than the powers we posses.

72
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,916
Are you trying to
say you admit defeat?

73
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,333
Rather than think in terms
of victory or defeat,

74
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:58,625
let's focus on the
previously unknown powers

75
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:00,958
you forced these
girls to demonstrate.

76
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:02,958
The possibilities
of those powers

77
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:05,750
are of great interest to me.

78
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:13,916
I'm reminded of something
Sister Margaret said...

79
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,583
"It may not be long

80
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:19,166
before these peaceful days
of ours come to an end"...

81
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:22,541
This is no time for Pandora
to be fighting one another...

82
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:23,958
Something terrible
may be looming

83
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:26,416
just ahead that
threatens us all.

84
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,166
You're saying we
need to preserve

85
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:29,875
our fighting potential...

86
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:31,458
That's so typical of you.

87
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:33,000
Based on everything
I've seen and heard,

88
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,666
Satellizer's abilities
are significantly

89
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,291
more powerful than
when I fought her.

90
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:39,208
That's a different
subject all together.

91
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:40,541
What I want to know is

92
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:42,291
how exactly we're going
to go about punishing her.

93
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:46,083
Taking into account that she
beat us last time... Right?

94
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:50,666
So you're all gonna hang your
heads in shame and back down?

95
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:51,916
What is your intent?

96
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,083
You're not suggesting
we go against Elizabeth?

97
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:58,000
You misunderstand me.

98
00:05:58,083 --> 00:05:59,541
We don't have to fight her...

99
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:03,000
There are so many other
ways to teach her a lesson.

100
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:06,500
Right...

101
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:08,208
All I have to do
is go up to Kazuya

102
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:11,041
and say "I'm sorry,
I lost my temper."

103
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:13,500
Then I'm sure I'll
stop feeling this way.

104
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:15,250
Kazuya, hello...!

105
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,916
I have been wondering
where you were!

106
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,583
I was searching over
the entire campus for you!

107
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:21,875
You were?

108
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:23,375
I was...! I just overheard
that there was to be

109
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:26,166
some sort of school dance
held here next week...!

110
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,375
I would simply be overjoyed

111
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:30,416
if the two of us
could dance together!

112
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,291
Oh... Have you already
invited Satellizer

113
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:34,625
to be your partner
for the dance?

114
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:38,333
Well... no... No, not yet...

115
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,500
Then you will be
able to go with me!

116
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:45,333
Thanks, but... Uh...

117
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,791
Satellizer!

118
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:52,666
Oh...! Wow, will you
look at the time...

119
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:53,916
Right...!

120
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,541
I just remembered
something I forgot to do.

121
00:06:58,041 --> 00:06:59,083
Don't leave me here!

122
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:00,708
Rana... I hate to
break it to you,...

123
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:01,750
Well, not really...

124
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:04,125
But Kazuya has
already invited me.

125
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:05,041
Huh?

126
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:05,875
How strange!

127
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:07,041
Because Kazuya just told me

128
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:08,875
that he had not invited you yet.

129
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:11,250
Come on, you two know better
than to start fighting here!

130
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:12,958
We are not fighting right now...

131
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:14,875
Unlike Satellizer,
I have enough sense

132
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:17,250
to know where fighting
is appropriate.

133
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:19,583
Then you know there's
no reason to fight now...!

134
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:24,250
Since Kazuya is my partner he'll
be going to the dance with me!

135
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:27,500
I didn't sign up for this.

136
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:28,750
I'm sorry, Rana.

137
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:30,208
Truth is...

138
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:32,875
I was already planning to
ask Satellizer to the dance.

139
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,041
So you have decided...

140
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:39,833
It seems I have no choice
but to accept my defeat.

141
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:41,083
What "defeat"?

142
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:44,833
However, I am not one
to give up that easily!

143
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,750
Oh dear god!

144
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,041
Kazuya...!

145
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:59,500
I'll let you know what
time to pick me up for prom.

146
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:00,625
Don't be late!

147
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:02,708
Yeah! I'll be there!

148
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:10,041
What's the count at?

149
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:12,958
We've got roughly seventy
votes from the first-years.

150
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:14,083
That's acceptable.

151
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:17,708
A lot of those new boys
don't have partners...

152
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:19,916
It should be easy
to entice them.

153
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,916
We've got a solid sixty votes
from the second-years.

154
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:24,416
I'm sorry, ma'am,

155
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,125
but the third-years
still favor Elizabeth...

156
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:27,416
We've only got twenty votes--

157
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,750
No excuses...

158
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:30,791
Get out there... and shore
up the third-year votes

159
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:32,416
no matter what it takes!

160
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,875
Yes... You can count on me.

161
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:35,750
I don't care if you
have to buy them...

162
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:38,125
if I don't find myself
standing among the finalists,

163
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:41,708
then I, Miyabi Kannazuki,
will never live with the shame!

164
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:45,375
I don't think this
one's right either!

165
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:51,916
What is wrong with that boy?

166
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Getting all flustered
because of a kiss...!

167
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:56,833
Well, if I wanted to do
something like that...

168
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:59,250
Not that I do,
but... if I did...

169
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:02,333
...I could... do it
much better than her.

170
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:05,000
How could I even
think such a thing?

171
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:10,208
Oh no...! It's going
to start any time now!

172
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:12,625
Uh... Hold on...! I'm coming!

173
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,333
So... having a
good night so far?

174
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:24,375
I'm sorry, I was
just a little nervous.

175
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:30,541
We should probably get going.

176
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:33,083
I... agree.

177
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:34,833
You two just make
the sweetest couple.

178
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:36,166
Who's there?!

179
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,166
It's Attia Simmons...

180
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,708
The sixth ranked third-year...

181
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:42,875
The Architect of Evil!

182
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:52,583
Now that I've won the top spot
for my year at the Carnival,...

183
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:53,958
I'm going to turn my attention

184
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:56,708
toward becoming this year's
Pandora Queen as well!

185
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:58,541
With your beauty
and womanly charm...

186
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:01,125
I think the title of queen
suits you perfectly...

187
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:03,166
You're sure to win
the crown tonight!

188
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,125
Wow... I guess I should
turn my attention

189
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:09,083
to finding an eligible guy...!

190
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:10,375
Which reminds me...

191
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:12,375
I wonder if Kazuya's here yet.

192
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:14,583
Well... yet another
year has come and gone,

193
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:16,166
but here we are again...

194
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:19,750
Welcome one and all to the
West Genetics Promenade...!

195
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,250
Having fun?

196
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,583
I certainly hope

197
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:28,750
we can get through the
festivities without incident.

198
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:31,000
The current average is
roughly five or six ending up

199
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:32,333
in the nurse's office.

200
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:33,583
Chiffon...

201
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,541
Will Sister Margaret be
joining us this evening?

202
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:37,750
She was invited but
she never responded.

203
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:39,500
I see... I was
worried about that.

204
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:40,875
What do you mean?

205
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:43,041
There's been an increase
of dimensional fluctuations

206
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:45,416
that's way beyond anything
we've seen before.

207
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,916
When did this start?!

208
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,416
Does it have any relation
to the appearance of the Nova?

209
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,458
We have no idea.

210
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:53,125
Sister Margaret's been
busy taking meetings

211
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:57,000
with the military and Chevalier
concerning these very issues.

212
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:58,916
I suggest that we all take time

213
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,458
to enjoy the party
on her behalf.

214
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:01,666
Whatever you say, ma'am...

215
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,750
We'll do our absolute best.

216
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,708
It's been decided by
the third-years that the

217
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:09,041
punishment for Satellizer
el Bridget will be suspended.

218
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:10,541
Suspended?

219
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:12,083
Therefore, I'm not here as
a representative of my class,

220
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:14,875
but merely as an individual
student acting on my own...

221
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:17,000
And I've come here to
challenge you to a duel!

222
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:20,291
Another duel?!
Please don't do this!

223
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:21,708
Kazuya!

224
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:23,125
Forgive me...

225
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:25,333
I know you don't
want me to interfere...

226
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:28,125
But I have to do this, even
if it means you yell at me.

227
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:31,541
I can't stand by doing nothing
when you're in harm's way...

228
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:33,166
If I didn't feel that,

229
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,166
I wouldn't be worthy
of being your partner...

230
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,375
That's just the way it is.

231
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:38,500
Kazuya.

232
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:40,000
Oh, goodness...

233
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:43,125
You two clearly have no idea
what I'm getting at, do you?

234
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I would detest seeing

235
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:48,125
our lovely prom
disrupted by bloodshed.

236
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,583
But you challenged me!

237
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:51,916
Yes, to a duel for the crown!

238
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,083
Enter the Pandora
Queen contest...

239
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:55,666
The winner of our
battle will be determined

240
00:11:55,750 --> 00:12:05,041
by the votes received!

241
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,000
If you're not up for it,
you can always say no,

242
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:08,750
but that would mean
admitting defeat

243
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:10,416
and I would be the
victor of the duel.

244
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,083
But that's ridiculous!

245
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:14,333
Fine.

246
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:17,708
I will accept...!
Your challenge!

247
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,958
Wait... Are you sure
you want to do this?

248
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:22,583
No matter what form
a battle may take...

249
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:25,083
I will never admit defeat!

250
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:29,541
I'll be looking forward to it!

251
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,625
And just so you know,...

252
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:33,666
you'll need more than
big jugs to beat me!

253
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,000
Jugs?

254
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:40,958
And now coming to the stage

255
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:44,333
is entry number seven:
The Angel of Binding...

256
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:46,208
...second-year Ganessa Roland!

257
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:48,583
Just call me "queen"!

258
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:49,958
The Pandora Queen...

259
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:52,083
It suits me well.

260
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:56,000
Yeah...! Miss Ganessa
is number one!

261
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:58,666
Entry number eight,
the Releaser of Chastity,

262
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:01,416
third-year Miyabi Kannazuki!

263
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,541
Come and get it.

264
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:17,666
Hey... what's up,
you don't look so good.

265
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,833
I know I said I would,

266
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:22,125
but the truth is that
I don't think I can do this...

267
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:23,750
It's all so humiliating!

268
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:26,541
Oh-kay... Well, you have
already entered the contest.

269
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:27,833
Satellizer...?

270
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:30,833
Are you taking part
in this event as well?

271
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:35,500
What on Earth are you wearing?

272
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:38,166
It's an homage to the
clothing of my homeland...

273
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,541
Do you like what
you are seeing?!

274
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:44,125
It's... very flattering...
I guess.

275
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:45,541
Entry number eleven:...

276
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:48,000
The Pulsating Stomach
Flesh, third-year...

277
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:50,125
Maruki Tone!

278
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:53,416
A battle to become
Pandora Queen?

279
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,416
That's the idea.

280
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:00,125
What's this...?

281
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:03,125
Admitting defeat before
our duel's even begun?

282
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:06,541
I do not think that I will
be defeated by you either.

283
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:10,416
She'll be a tough one too!

284
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,250
Great...! It's so adorable
that you think you can win!

285
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:14,625
Entry number thirteen:

286
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:17,958
The Architect of Evil,
third-year Attia Simmons!

287
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:19,041
You go girl!

288
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:20,541
She is hot!

289
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:23,166
Lesson for the day:

290
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:26,166
A woman's appeal doesn't rest
solely on the size of her bust.

291
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:28,333
Learn it well, boys.

292
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,750
Whoa...!

293
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:32,041
She's getting a pretty
good response from the crowd.

294
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:34,625
Oh... it is my turn
to go up on stage!

295
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,250
Satellizer.

296
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,541
Any honors that
are won by a Pandora

297
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:41,875
are honors shared by her
partner, would you not agree?

298
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:42,791
Just think it over...

299
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:44,333
If you look at things like that,

300
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:48,625
even difficult
challenges become easier.

301
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:52,875
Now coming to the stage
is entry number fourteen:

302
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:55,666
the yet to be nicknamed
mysterious transfer student,

303
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:58,166
second-year Rana Linchen!

304
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:10,500
I believe it is right
to show compassion

305
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:13,458
even to someone who is my rival.

306
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:14,541
You'll be going up next...

307
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:16,541
so you need to get
ready now, please.

308
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,791
Are you leaving?

309
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:21,125
I'm going to see
this thing through.

310
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:23,375
You know you don't have to
do this if you don't want to.

311
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:27,708
I realize that...
This isn't something I want.

312
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:30,333
But I have to go
out there... for you.

313
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:31,958
What do you mean... "for me"?

314
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:33,041
Let's head to the stage...

315
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:35,250
You're up now.

316
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:41,875
My actions aren't just a
reflection of me, not anymore.

317
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:43,625
I'm doing this for us.

318
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:46,000
Up next, entry number fifteen.

319
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:47,458
Wait...! What's this...?

320
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:49,500
It's the Untouchable Queen...

321
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:50,833
That's right...

322
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:54,000
Give it up for second-year
Satellizer el Bridget!

323
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:54,541
What did he say?!

324
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:55,958
I'm seeing it,

325
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:58,125
I just can't believe the
Untouchable Queen is doing it!

326
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:02,375
Oh, my...

327
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:04,000
Now I think
I've seen everything.

328
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:05,208
That is strange...

329
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:06,541
Up until now, she's
never even attended any

330
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:09,125
of the social events
we've held here at school.

331
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:12,416
It's because of
Kazuya Aoi, of course.

332
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,541
Sister Margaret!

333
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:15,208
I believe that Satellizer

334
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:18,333
has found herself
an excellent partner.

335
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,291
She's frozen in
place out there...

336
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:23,500
She doesn't have a chance

337
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:24,958
against Attia
standing still like that...

338
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:27,583
She's gonna have problems
with the crowd soon, too.

339
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:34,125
It didn't even occur to me what
I was going to do out here...!

340
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:35,750
Now what?!

341
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:39,041
She is... incredible.

342
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:41,416
Yeah... and she looks
so innocent up there.

343
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,875
The Untouchable Queen
who's normally

344
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:44,500
so merciless and terrifying,

345
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:46,791
now appears to be so
demure and fragile...!

346
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:48,041
She's a tour de force!

347
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:51,333
Yeah!

348
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:53,166
How humiliating!

349
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,125
Satellizer.

350
00:16:57,708 --> 00:16:59,833
You were great out there.

351
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:02,791
Now our final entry
for the evening...!

352
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:05,708
Last year's Pandora
Queen... third-year...

353
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:10,541
The Executor of Ingenious
Schemes, Elizabeth Mably!

354
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:32,000
It looks like I couldn't
find Mr. Right after all.

355
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:32,958
Do not worry about it.

356
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:34,666
You will have plenty of chances.

357
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:37,291
Yes... there will
be many opportunities

358
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:39,916
to challenge you after tonight.

359
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,250
So are you excited...?

360
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:42,791
About the results?

361
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:48,458
I was terrible... I just stood
there doing nothing at all.

362
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:50,208
Not only were you
courageous out there,

363
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:52,458
but you did it all for me...

364
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:55,416
I thought it was... inspiring.

365
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:01,333
Uhm, Kazuya... I just...

366
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:02,416
Yes?

367
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,250
Well, I thought
that if you'd like...

368
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:06,125
I mean...

369
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:07,791
What is it?

370
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:10,875
I... I thought maybe
we could formally--

371
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:13,416
It's finally time to
announce the results...!

372
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,375
We'll start with our
fifth place winner!

373
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:20,208
She is...

374
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:24,166
Miyabi Kannazuki!

375
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,416
Oh come on,
don't act so surprised!

376
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:30,583
Uhm, I've just received
some information...

377
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:33,833
There was an
irregularity in the voting.

378
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:37,916
Therefore, Miss Miyabi
will be disqualified...

379
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,750
...which means fifth place...
is awarded to Ganessa Roland!

380
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:44,708
You did it...! I told you
you'd place, didn't I?

381
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:45,958
I hate to say it,

382
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:48,333
but this is far from how
I pictured things going.

383
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:51,208
In fourth place: Rana Linchen!

384
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:54,583
Kazuya...! I am in the top five!

385
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:57,083
Congratulations.

386
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:59,416
Third place with one hundred
twenty-seven votes:

387
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,583
Third-year, Attia Simmons!

388
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,916
Attia ended up
in third place...?

389
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
So that means if you end up
getting first or second,

390
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:09,208
she'll have to admit
that you beat her!

391
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:11,250
You were great out
there, Miss Attia.

392
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:13,500
It's merely adequate.

393
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:14,833
Taking second place

394
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:16,916
with a hundred ninety-eight
votes: third-year...

395
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Elizabeth Mably!

396
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:22,500
So Elizabeth didn't
take first place again...?

397
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:23,875
Then who won the crown?

398
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:25,958
Who could have stood a
chance against Elizabeth...?

399
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:27,125
Can you think of anyone?

400
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:28,916
No... Nobody.

401
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,041
And now... your new Queen...

402
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:36,750
With five hundred
sixty-eight votes:

403
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:42,708
second-year,
Satellizer el Bridget!

404
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:44,333
What?!

405
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:46,666
Me?

406
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,166
Wow... Neat.

407
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:49,666
What a surprise...

408
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:52,125
Don't worry, there's still
something I can do about this!

409
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:53,291
Hey! Where are you going?

410
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:54,791
Congratulations Satellizer!

411
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:56,166
This is so exciting...!

412
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:58,208
I see that Kazuya
is proud of you too!

413
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:01,958
I could accept defeat
from anyone but you!

414
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:04,250
Man... I never expected
the Untouchable Queen

415
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:06,250
to become the Pandora Queen!

416
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:08,916
You're sure you
want to use this?

417
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,958
Of course... This was
part of the visual theme

418
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:12,916
we decided on for
this year's prom...

419
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,250
Elizabeth had prepared
this dress herself.

420
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:16,875
Miss Elizabeth did?

421
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:18,750
Unfortunately,
she never anticipated

422
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:19,916
that victory would slip

423
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,791
from her grasp and
so we must all adapt...

424
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:23,125
That's why it's so important

425
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:25,916
to her that the new queen
be presented with it.

426
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,458
Well, in that case...

427
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:28,791
Stop...! Enough talk...!

428
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:30,416
Elizabeth wants
the queen to wear this

429
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,291
so that's what's going to
happen, is that understood?!

430
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:35,583
Yes... We understand.

431
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:37,958
Please, come this way.

432
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:39,708
Huh...? Wait... What now?

433
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:40,958
We have to hurry

434
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:42,583
so you can change into
your coronation dress!

435
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:43,833
My what?

436
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:45,208
The time has come...!

437
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:47,833
It's my honor to present
this year's Pandora Queen!

438
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,333
This outfit's disgraceful...!

439
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:57,958
It was hard enough to let people
see me in the dress I had on!

440
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:02,541
Did you have a
hand with that outfit?

441
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:04,375
I wanted to give her
something special...

442
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:06,375
It's a novelty dress
for couples.

443
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:07,583
It's a what?

444
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:10,041
Watch... The fabric
reacts to body heat...

445
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:11,791
...and then...

446
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:13,250
Woah... Hey!

447
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:14,958
It... can't be!

448
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:23,375
Hey, what's going on...?!

449
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:25,333
What's happening
to her clothing?

450
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:26,666
I... don't know!

451
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:29,375
The color fades and the
dress becomes transparent!

452
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:31,875
We finally taught that
impudent little girl

453
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:34,291
a lesson she won't soon forget!

454
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:36,250
Why would she
even have something

455
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:37,583
like that in the first place?

456
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:39,500
She's got a lot of
unresolved issues...

457
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:40,458
...that's my guess.

458
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:43,500
Kazuya, please help me!

459
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:49,208
Here, take my hand... C'mon!

460
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:51,708
Right, thanks.

461
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:58,333
Even the toughest among
us has a soft side.

462
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,833
She is the top ranked third-year
student here at East Genetics.

463
00:23:44,916 --> 00:23:48,333
Her name is Cathy Lockharte.

464
00:23:48,416 --> 00:23:50,791
Next time:
"Godspeed of the East."
