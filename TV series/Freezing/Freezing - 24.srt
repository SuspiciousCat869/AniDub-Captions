But even so...

161
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:27,708
We're friends and I don't
want any of you to get hurt.

162
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:29,625
I don't want to lose you either.

163
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:32,583
I suppose that's selfish
in a way, isn't it?

[SATELLIZER gasps]

[CHIFFON] All I can think
about is what matters to me.

166
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:40,250
And that makes me no better than
the humans I would condemn.

You're wrong.

168
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:44,875
[CHIFFON] So, like a human,
I've made one last choice.

169
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:47,791
One selfish decision
that's for me alone.

170
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:50,333
I'm going to protect my friends.

What are you saying?

You're not making any sense!

It doesn't have to be this way!

Thank you, Chiffon.

[CHIFFON] No.
I should be thanking you.

If you hadn't fought
so hard to avoid

being swallowed by your hatred,

You see, Amelia,

I've decided I have to keep my
friends safe, no matter what.

And I know the price I will pay

for something like this
is going be extreme.

[AMELIA]
No, Chiffon, you can't.

193

Don't do this.

There's no other alternative.

195
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,250
I only have one hope.

196
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:41,208
That somehow through
my sacrifice,

197
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:43,375
humanity will learn to
right the terrible wrongs

This is too much
for me to handle.

better than I ever was.

used to tell you.

No matter how terrible things
might get, as long as you smile.

I think I know.

one thing it could be.

Forgive me for what I said.

contempt for you.

And that was that.

From the little I heard after,

244
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:31,958
it seemed things turned
out pretty well.

Luckily, the E-Pandora
Rattle managed to survive.

And I'm glad to say
Amelia did too.

The negative effects of
the biochemical experiments

conducted on her have been
completely wiped away,

which is really incredible news.

And all the tissue
she lost from her body

rescued as well.

was permanently discontinued.

be criticized.

But to be completely
honest with you...

...there's no way I can
leave Andrei behind.

And I couldn't
begin to think of

teaming up with another Limiter.

I decided to go back to Japan.

Oh, Kazuya, you've
finally come home!

Don't touch him,
you ignorant country girl!

If I am an ignorant
country girl,

then I am sorry to say it,

but you are nothing more
than a helper! So eat that.

Will you stop with
this helper nonsense?

no need to worry.

be a little selfish.
