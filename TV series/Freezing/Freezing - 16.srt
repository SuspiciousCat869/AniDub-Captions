00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,791
It's so sad.

166
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:05,083
[RATTLE sobs]

167
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:08,916
[AMELIA]
Goodbye, Jina.

168
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:15,958
[JINA] The Mark IV.
It's no good. It's a sham.

169
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:18,416
[AMELIA] A sham.

170
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,333
If that's true then
you fell for the lie

171
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:22,000
and it swallowed you whole.

172
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:26,875
I promise you, Jina.
There will be a reckoning.

173
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:31,750
[group cries]

174
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:34,583
[OHARA]
What's going on here?

175
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:38,208
I don't recall giving you girls
permission to start a fire.

176
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:39,416
I thought you
might be involved

177
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,416
when I got word of
this little gathering.

178
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,666
What is this, a funeral?

179
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,333
[AMELIA] Yeah.

180
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:50,250
She was one of our own,
it's only right we do this.

181
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:54,125
Do you know what Jina
told me before she died?

182
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:57,291
She said the Mark IV is a sham.

183
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:01,875
[RATTLE] A-Amelia.

184
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:03,333
[AMELIA] You knew this
was going to happen

185
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:07,458
from the very beginning,
didn't you?

186
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:09,333
So I guess...

187
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:11,208
...that we're just some
kind of Guinea pigs

188
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:14,583
for your twisted experiments?

189
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:17,375
[OHARA] Even if Chevalier does
think of you in those terms,

190
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:19,958
you can take comfort in
the fact that the sacrifices

191
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:23,791
you make are for the
betterment of humankind.

192
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:27,375
However, this doesn't mean the
Mark IV experiments are over.

193
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:30,750
Now put out that fire and
return to your quarters.

194
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,375
You really think
that we'll obey?

195
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:42,333
[OHARA] Of course you will.
You don't have a choice.

196
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:06,125
[PANDORA 4A]
Guys, did ya hear what happened?

197
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:08,666
That powered up E-Pandora
turned into a Nova,

198
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:09,666
so they had to kill her.

199
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:10,875
[PANDORA 4B]
Yeah, that's crazy.

200
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:12,916
Sounds like the
Mark IV's a bad deal.

201
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,291
[PANDORA 4C] Good thing
we're real Pandora

202
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:15,916
and not some experiment.

203
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,083
[PANDORA 4A] I know.

204
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,416
[PANDORA 4B]
You want my opinion?

205
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,458
That's what regular people
get for trying to become

206
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:21,875
something they're not.

207
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:24,416
[RANA]
Greetings, Satellizer!

208
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,625
Perhaps you would be so
kind as to accompany me

209
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:27,875
to Kazuya's room!

210
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:29,875
Or conversely, I could
venture there on my own.

211
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:32,916
Heh! Perhaps I will wear this!

212
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,708
Imagine what a
scandal it would be!

213
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,000
Might I inquire as to
what is troubling you?

214
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:42,375
[SATELLIZER]
It's none of your business.

215
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:48,666
I know not what the precise
meaning of your abrupt exit is.

216
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,250
But if you mean to
ignore a direct order,

217
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:52,875
I fear trouble awaits you.

218
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:54,625
Greetings, Elizabeth.

219
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:56,041
You should listen
to your friend,

220
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:58,166
there is no point in
what you're doing.

221
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,833
And why is that exactly?

222
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:02,500
[ELIZABETH] Because I just
went to see Dr. Ohara myself

223
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:04,833
and she refused
to talk to me.

224
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:06,125
Satellizer.

225
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:08,083
I have to say, it doesn't
seem like your style

226
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:10,916
to stick your nose
where it doesn't belong.

227
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,333
[SATELLIZER]
The Original Pandora data

228
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:14,000
installed in the
Mark IV is mine,

229
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:15,916
so I'd say I'm well
within my rights.

230
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,083
[RANA] Huh?

231
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:19,375
An innocent person
transformed into a Nova

232
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:22,250
and was brutally killed because
that data was given to them.

233
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:26,125
I know you heard what she said.
Jina called Mark IV a big sham.

234
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:28,541
She truly made that claim?

235
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:31,541
It's just like
you told me.

236
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:33,791
A Pandora is a Pandora,
no matter what.

237
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:35,416
And honestly,
until I met Jina,

238
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,708
I thought you were
just saying that!

239
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:40,291
But she showed me you
had it right all along.

240
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:41,958
[JINA] The truth is,
for most of my life

241
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:43,750
I always hated the world.

242
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:48,958
But. Now I finally feel
I can learn to like it.

243
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:52,625
I'm a real E-Pandora.

244
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:55,208
And I'm proud!

245
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:57,375
[SATELLIZER]
But now she's dead.

246
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:02,041
[SATELLIZER]
She's gone forever.

247
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:05,625
[ELIZABETH] I see.

248
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:08,875
Somehow, you think this is your
fault, and you want to help.

249
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:11,041
Well, it isn't, and even
if it was your fault,

250
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:12,500
I would still tell
you to stay away.

251
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:14,083
[SATELLIZER] Why?

252
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:17,875
Because this is not
any of your business.

253
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:20,333
[SATELLIZER] Yeah?
Whose is it then?

254
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:22,625
[ELIZABETH]
I don't know.

255
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,500
Excuse me.

256
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:40,541
[ELIZABETH]
A bit chilly, isn't it?

257
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:42,000
[AMELIA]
Oh, Ms. Mably.

258
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:43,458
[ELIZABETH]
Ms. Mably's my mother.

259
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:45,375
I've told you this
before and I meant it:

260
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:47,541
you can call me Elizabeth.

261
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:57,500
For what it's worth,
I think it's a real shame

262
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:59,291
what happened to
Jina Purpleton.

263
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:00,375
[AMELIA]
With all due respect,

264
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:02,208
It's really none
of your concern.

265
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:07,041
Yeah, I guess you're right.
It's probably not.

266
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:09,375
So, are you planning
on moving forward?

267
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:11,333
I know that's not
really my business.

268
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:15,541
But that doesn't make
me any less curious.

269
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:18,208
[AMELIA] We don't exactly
have a choice in the matter.

270
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:20,791
At least that's what
our contracts say.

271
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:23,833
[AMELIA] I imagine this
is just the beginning

272
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:25,916
for the E-Pandora Project.

273
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,416
People like me will start
signing up by the dozens.

274
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:34,041
[AMELIA] And when one
experiment goes awry,

275
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:36,250
they'll just move
on to the next one.

276
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:38,666
They'll keep going forward
like nothing ever happened

277
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,541
in the first place.

278
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:44,583
But, I'm sure they can
only keep their failures

279
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:47,166
hidden away for so long.

280
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:50,250
At least my sacrifices might
prevent future E-Pandora

281
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:53,416
from falling victim
to these experiments.

282
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,750
[ELIZABETH] So what?

283
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:56,125
You're going to volunteer
for the next experiment

284
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:58,583
to protect a bunch of people
you've never even met?

285
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:01,708
What about protecting
yourself, Amelia?

286
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:07,083
[AMELIA] I hate
to do this to you.

287
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:09,791
But I have a favor to ask.

288
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:13,208
If something happens to me

289
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:15,375
during the next
round of experiments,

290
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:18,416
please go see my brother.

291
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,583
Will you?

292
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:22,583
If it comes to that,
please tell him we were friends

293
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:26,708
who fought side by side
for a good cause.

294
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,583
If you could tell
him I died bravely

295
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:30,250
fighting for the
principles I believed in

296
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:32,625
it would mean the world to me.

297
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:36,625
That's pretty awful
of me, isn't it?

298
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:39,083
I have no right to pretend
that you and I are friends.

299
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:42,458
Forget that I even asked.

300
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:44,541
You're probably right.

301
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:46,666
I suppose we don't know
each other well enough

302
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:50,125
to call each other
friends just yet.

303
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:52,375
[AMELIA sighs]

304
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:54,208
But I do respect you.

305
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:56,833
And I can honestly say you're
one of the few people here

306
00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:58,625
I feel that way about.

307
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:03,875
[ELIZABETH] I'm proud to have
made your acquaintance, Amelia.

308
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:05,625
From the bottom of my heart.

309
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:09,416
Me, too.
Thanks, Ms. Mably.

310
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,750
[ELIZABETH]
I told you already...

311
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:17,791
I would like you to
call me Elizabeth.

312
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:24,041
[AMELIA cries]

313
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:28,833
[AMELIA] Thank you
so much, Elizabeth.

314
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:56,166
[ELIZABETH] Doesn't it
seem a bit suspicious?

315
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,541
Hm? What're you
talking about?

316
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:00,000
[ELIZABETH] The Mark IV.

317
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:03,125
Something was off about
it from the very start.

318
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:05,291
And now a person is dead.

319
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:08,708
I wonder if the Mark IV was
ever meant to succeed at all.

320
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:11,166
It seems the earlier
prototype, the Mark III,

321
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,666
had its fair share of
controversy as well.

322
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:16,166
[CHIFFON] Perhaps you should
keep your voice down.

323
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:17,375
Is it a lie?

324
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:20,083
The whole E-Pandora Project?

325
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:21,625
[CHIFFON] It's like
you always say.

326
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:24,041
We can talk ourselves
in circles all we want,

327
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:26,708
but at the end of the day,
there's nothing we can do.

328
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:27,791
[ELIZABETH]
That's not true.

329
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:29,000
[CHIFFON] Huh?

330
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:30,416
[ELIZABETH]
We can do something about it.

331
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,750
If we work together we
can come up with a plan.

332
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:38,583
I am proud to call myself
a member of Chevalier.

333
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:40,208
The things that
we do are entirely

334
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:44,916
for the preservation and
betterment of human kind.

335
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,958
If I ever let my
faith in that waver

336
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:49,500
the importance of the Pandora
would be lost as well.

337
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:51,875
Are you saying that
you're okay with this?

338
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:53,541
You're going to
ignore everything

339
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:54,500
that happened to Jina?

340
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:56,291
As Pandora, we have to.

341
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:58,625
It's our job to do
whatever it takes.

342
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:01,458
Sometimes that means people
get hurt in the process.

343
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:03,333
And that's just how it is.

344
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:06,125
Leave the politics
to the politicians.

345
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:10,250
[ELIZABETH] Well, then.

346
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:13,458
I guess I'll have to
involve my family.

347
00:22:25,375 --> 00:22:28,291
What is it you would need
to involve your family for?

348
00:22:28,375 --> 00:22:29,875
[ELIZABETH]
You were listening.

349
00:22:29,958 --> 00:22:31,208
Well, never mind.

350
00:22:31,291 --> 00:22:35,125
It's like I told you before:
stay out of it.

351
00:22:35,208 --> 00:22:37,416
[SATELLIZER] Why won't
you let me help you?

352
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:40,375
You're asking your
family for help,

353
00:22:40,458 --> 00:22:42,583
so why not ask the
same thing of me?

354
00:22:42,666 --> 00:22:45,083
Obviously, you're willing to
sacrifice your pride because

355
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:46,583
you feel that there's
something important

356
00:22:46,666 --> 00:22:48,708
you need to accomplish.

357
00:22:48,791 --> 00:22:51,083
I think I can help
you make it happen.

358
00:22:51,166 --> 00:22:52,625
[ELIZABETH] Is she talking
about reaching out

359
00:22:52,708 --> 00:22:54,666
to the El Bridget family?

360
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:58,166
I don't like
repeating myself.

361
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:01,125
This isn't your concern,
so stay out of it.

362
00:23:01,208 --> 00:23:03,083
[SATELLIZER]
Then I'll do it myself.

363
00:23:03,166 --> 00:23:05,541
Oh yeah? Do what?

364
00:23:07,875 --> 00:23:10,958
I'm only trying to help you.
Why won't you let me?

365
00:23:11,041 --> 00:23:13,666
You need to learn your place!

366
00:23:16,583 --> 00:23:18,000
[SATELLIZER yells]

367
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:29,333
[SATELLIZER] Why?

368
00:23:29,416 --> 00:23:32,166
[ELIZABETH] I won't waste my
time talking to you anymore.

369
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:35,000
Why don't you just go
outside and cool down?

370
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:39,708
Outside?

371
00:23:41,208 --> 00:23:42,625
[KAZUYA] What are you doing?
That's against the rules!

372
00:23:42,708 --> 00:23:44,500
[ELIZABETH] If any harm
comes to me or my family...

373
00:23:44,583 --> 00:23:46,083
[KAZUYA] We're supposed to be
flying back to West Genetics!

374
00:23:46,166 --> 00:23:48,041
[LUIS] It's good
to see you, Sister.

375
00:23:48,125 --> 00:23:50,875
[SATELLIZER] Next time,
"Noblesse Oblige."
