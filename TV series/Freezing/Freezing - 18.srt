It's good to see
you again. Sister.

[metallic thud]

00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:42,750
[VIOLET] Allow me
to introduce you.

5
00:00:42,833 --> 00:00:46,000
This is Kazuya Aoi,
Satellizer's limiter.

6
00:00:46,083 --> 00:00:48,208
It's nice to meet you.

7
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:50,416
I'm Luis, Satella's
younger brother.

8
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:54,041
It's a pleasure to make
your acquaintance.

9
00:00:54,125 --> 00:00:55,375
[KAZUYA] Same here.

10
00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:57,291
I gotta admit,
I'm surprised.

11
00:00:57,375 --> 00:00:59,625
I definitely didn't expect
my little Satellizer

12
00:00:59,708 --> 00:01:01,166
to bring her Limiter.

[SATELLIZER stammers]

But as a fellow
Limiter myself.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,166
It's always good to
meet one of my own.

16
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,458
Wait, so you're
a Limiter, too?

17
00:01:10,541 --> 00:01:12,958
Of course, as a
matter of fact,

18
00:01:13,041 --> 00:01:14,208
I'm a member of
the world-renowned

Genetics Britain UK.

20

That's really cool.

00:01:24,166 --> 00:01:25,666
And by the way.

25
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,541
That's my partner back there.

you actually brought

00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:32,625
the Pandora recovery team
and facility here

35

[VIOLET]
Yes, well.

38
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:44,208
The El Bridget family

39

Not just Genetics either,

[KAZUYA] Wow.
This place is incredible!

I mean it, your
family's amazing!

It's like they're from a
different world or something!

Seriously.

47

I can't get over the fact
that I'm actually standing

in this room talking
to you right now!

This is insane.

I bet normally, a daughter
of the El Bridget family

51

wouldn't be caught
dead talking to me!

Oh no. Really, I'm okay.

It's just the things
you're saying

have nothing to do with me.

It's true, my family
may be great.

But I'm nothing.
I'm not special.

Yes, you are. Heh.

63
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:02,333
You're a member of the
famous El Bridget family.

That makes you an
extraordinary person!

it complements your features.

[LUIS] Hmph. We haven't
seen each other in years.

I think a small
celebration is in order.

[cork pops]

87
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,875
[LUIS] I'm curious
about something.

88
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:29,333
Violet mentioned
that you asked her

89
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:31,750
to speak with Father
on your behalf.

90
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:33,291
I wonder why.

91
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:34,958
Surely you're not
dumb enough to try

92
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:37,583
and get the El Bridget
Family involved.

93
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:40,583
[LUIS]
So, that's it then.

94
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,583
After what happened
with the Mably Family,

95
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:45,041
I certainly had my suspicions.

that don't surface

98
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,208
unless Chevalier wants them to.

99
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:52,708
[SATELLIZER] Huh?

00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:57,125
This was a set up.

An expert smear job
courtesy of Chevalier.

104

Yeah, but why?

105
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:03,583
Why would Chevalier
wanna smear the Mablys?

106
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:04,458
[LUIS] Well...

107
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:06,833
Your guess is as good as mine.

108
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:08,875
But the Mably daughter

West genetics to
the E-Pandora lab?

There's zero chance in
hell that's a coincidence.

[SATELLIZER] Elizabeth.

112
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:23,666
[LUIS] Everything I've learned
from the reach of my family's

113
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,791
information network
suggests there's something

114
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:29,125
extremely iffy
going on in that lab.

115
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:30,958
That's why Holly and I
chose to get outta there

while we still
had the chance.

117

[LUIS] Still. I don't know
what you have in mind here.

118
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,958
But, do you honestly think
the El Bridget family--

119
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:45,583
or better yet, father--will
get involved on your behalf?

120
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:49,208
In his mind, you're nothing more
than his mistresses' daughter.

121
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:50,583
Plus.

122
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:53,375
My mother detests yours,
even if father did consent,

123
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:55,875
do you really think
she'd tolerate it?

124
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:57,250
However...

125
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:00,791
...if I asked him,
he might listen.

00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,000
I'll convince him for you.

128
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:06,583
And don't worry about Mother,
I'll bring her around as well.

I am here to stop those
horrible experiments at

the E-Pandora lab and pick up
where Elizabeth left off.

what he wants, but I can't.

00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:41,250
[LUIS] So don't
be disrespectful.

164
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:43,875
And call me
what you used to!

165
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:46,541
Do I make myself clear?

166
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,541
[SATELLIZER (weakly)]
Yes.

167
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:53,041
Oh man. What did I do?

168
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,625
[clock chimes]

169
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:56,416
[KAZUYA] I guess she
got upset because I was

170
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:00,291
going on and on about how great
the el Bridget family is.

171
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:02,958
Tomorrow I'll make
sure to apologize.

172
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:06,375
Hopefully she won't hold
it against me for too long.

173
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:07,875
[LUIS] Come on!

174
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:10,708
Did you really think that
little boy could protect you?

175
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:12,083
[SATELLIZER sobs]

176
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:13,666
[LUIS] When father was ready
to throw you to the curb

177
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,833
because my mother couldn't
bear the sight of you,

178
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:18,583
I was the only one
who gave you comfort.

179
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:21,583
I took pity on you!

180
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:23,875
Will you respect me now?

181
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:27,041
[SATELLIZER] Yes.
I will always respect you.

182
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:28,833
No matter what, Master.

183
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:30,916
The truth is that
I have never forgotten

184
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,666
all the things you did for me.

185
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,125
That's so wonderful
to hear, Satella.

186
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:38,541
I was quite delighted to learn
that at West Genetics

187
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:41,500
everyone refers to you
as the Untouchable Queen.

188
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:42,791
The perfect name.

189
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,708
Because you're
a good little toy,

190
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:48,000
and you wouldn't let
any man touch you but me.

191
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:49,208
[SATELLIZER] No.

192
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:51,791
Deep down. You have
always longed for this.

193
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:53,583
You've yearned for
my gentle touch.

194
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:55,625
Caressing your body up and down!

195
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:56,875
[SATELLIZER] No!

196
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:59,291
I despise your touch and
everything about you!

197
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:02,541
Feeling your hands on me
again makes me sick!

198
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:05,208
[LUIS] Isn't that
right, Satella?

199
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:07,625
[SATELLIZER] Yes.
Of course, Master.

200
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:10,625
[LUIS laughs]

201
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:14,291
[LUIS] I knew it! I knew
it was true all along!

202
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:15,875
I knew there was
no way you could've

203
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:17,541
forgotten about me, Satella!

204
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:19,708
You'll always be mine forever!

205
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:21,875
[SATELLIZER] One day you'll
get what's coming to you!

206
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:24,500
[SATELLIZER] Yes.
Of course, master!

207
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:27,250
[LUIS] Since you remember,
you can call me Luis now.

208
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:29,625
Thank you for your
kindness, Luis.

209
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:31,333
[LUIS] Yes. Oh, yes.

210
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:33,666
It's been four years!

211
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,583
The sister I used
to know years ago

212
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:37,500
has finally returned to me!

213
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:40,791
And I'll never let you go no
matter what happens, Satella.

214
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:42,458
I'll never let another
person take away

215
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:44,083
what's rightfully mine!

216
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:47,333
From now on, I'm the only man
who gets to touch you, aren't I?

217
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:48,875
Yes, of course.

218
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,875
You may do as you wish, Luis.

219
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:51,875
[LUIS] Huh?

220
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:53,875
There is no reason
to hold back.

221
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:58,083
Because I'm your Marionette
and I always will be.

222
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:00,458
[LUIS] Do as I wish?

223
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:05,916
[LUIS] How dare you say
something like that to me?

224
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,583
[LUIS]
Why did I do that?

225
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:17,458
Why'd I hit my sister?

226
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:21,791
Satella. I'm so sorry.

227
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,708
I get no pleasure from it.

228
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:26,125
This brings me no joy.

229
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:27,458
And yet.

230
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:32,708
Telling me that I can do
as I wish. It's not fair!

231
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:33,833
Why?

232
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:36,458
Why does it have
to be this way?

233
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:39,125
Why do you have to be my sister?

Hey, good morning.

00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:11,375
I thought we could go
eat breakfast together.

238
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,083
No thanks.

239
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:15,125
I don't have an
appetite today.

Oh. What's the matter,
are you not feeling well?

No, it's nothing, really.

I'm fine.

00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:25,250
Sattela, did something happen?

No. I said I'm fine.

[KAZUYA] Oh, hey.

[LUIS] Mr. Aoi.

00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:56,208
I understand you haven't had
a baptism with my sister yet.

00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:58,583
[KAZUYA] No.
We haven't, actually.

00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:00,500
Well, that's
certainly a relief.

255
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:03,291
What? Why is
that a relief?

256
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:05,583
I'm gonna level
with you, Kazuya.

257
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:07,416
[KAZUYA]
Level with me about what?

258
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,541
[LUIS] I think it would be
best for everyone involved

259
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:12,125
if you were to forget
about Satella.

260

[KAZUYA] Uh.

261
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:18,083
[KAZUYA] What's this?

262
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:21,083
[LUIS] A return ticket home and
a small bit of compensation.

263
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:24,000
I ask that you take it.

264
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:27,916
Just think of it as severance
pay for leaving Satella alone.

265
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,375
Listen. If I were you,
I would use this

266
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:33,166
as an opportunity to find
a more suitable partner.

[KAZUYA gasps]

268
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:37,916
[LUIS] Satella can't stand
being in Genetics anymore.

269
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,291
Soon, she'll give up
being a Pandora entirely

270
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:43,250
and settle down with someone
worthy of the el Bridget name.

271
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:46,000
[KAZUYA] But I'm her limiter;
I can't just leave her behind.

272
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:48,458
I wasn't asking, Mr. Aoi.

273
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:50,125
[KAZUYA scoffs]

274
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:53,958
So. You should hurry home
and find a new partner.

275
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:56,708
From now on, Satella will
have nothing to do with you.

276
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:59,666
She's back with her family
where she belongs.

277
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,375
[KAZUYA sighs]

278
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:07,375
I get it, Luis. And I
understand you might be

279
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:09,041
concerned for your
sister's future.

280
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:13,500
[LUIS] Hm. Only if that
future involves you.

281
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:15,666
[KAZUYA]
Look at me.

282
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,541
Whatever Satellizer
chooses to do,

283
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,083
it's none of your business.

284
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:20,166
[LUIS scoffs]

285
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:25,125
[KAZUYA] You're nothing
but her kid brother.

286
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:28,583
So stop sticking your nose
where it doesn't belong.

287
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:30,041
Later.

[VIOLET]
Oh, hey, Kazuya!

00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:53,166
I certainly hope
you're having a good time

291
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:56,208
at El Bridget family estate!

[KAZUYA sighs]

293
00:15:57,833 --> 00:15:59,750
I'm sorry. I don't mean to pry,

294
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:03,416
but it seems as if
something is bothering you.

295
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,416
That's okay.
You don't have to tell me.

296
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,708
But when I'm sad,
you know what I do?

297
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:09,708
Smile and have a great time!

298
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:11,875
After all, vacation
exists to help us forget

299
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:13,583
all the stupid things
that are bringing us down

300
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:15,916
and keeping us
from being happy!

301
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
It's a time to sit back,
relax and enjoy

302
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:20,125
the pleasure of being
truly unfettered.

303
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:22,708
Allowing ourselves
freedom is key.

304
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:25,125
Actually, I think it's
what keeps us sane.

305
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:28,500
It gives us perspective
and reminds us who we are.

306
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:29,708
You want my opinion;

307
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:32,291
there is zero fun in
being shackled forever.

308
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:34,041
And you know.

309
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:36,041
If you really let go
and find a way to have

310
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:38,416
a good time in spite of all
the stuff weighing you down,

311
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:42,708
you might learn new and
exciting things about yourself.

312
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:46,416
So, if something is
really troubling you, smile.

313
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,291
Let it roll right off your back.

314
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:50,208
Take full advantage
of my family's resort

315

while you're here.
Because who knows?

316
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:55,125
A simple smile may just
set your heart free.

Trust me.

00:16:57,791 --> 00:17:00,333
A little fun can
do a lot of good.

320
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:03,000
But you won't know
unless you try.

321
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:07,916
Hey, thanks a lot
for the advice!

322
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:17,625
Satellizer.

323
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:20,750
[thunder rumbles]

324
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:33,250
[KAZUYA] There you are!

325
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:34,416
[SATELLIZER gasps]

326
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,458
[SATELLIZER] Huh.
What are you doing here?

327
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:40,458
[KAZUYA] Hm? I got your letter
asking me to come meet you.

328
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:42,083
[SATELLIZER exhales sharply]

329
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:44,750
You have no idea what
I'm talking about, do you?

330
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:48,208
No I. I didn't
write you a letter.

331
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:49,500
[LUIS] Well...

332
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:52,333
Looks like the gang's all here.

333
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:54,250
I wrote the letter.

334
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:58,750
[SATELLIZER gasps]

335
00:17:58,833 --> 00:17:59,833
[LUIS chuckles]

336
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:05,041
What is this about?
What do you want from us?

337
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,500
[LUIS] I want you to pay
attention to what happens next.

338
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:08,708
You might learn something.

339
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:10,333
Learn what?

340
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:14,583
[LUIS] Satella. Tell your
friend what you call me.

341
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:16,750
[KAZUYA] Hm?

342
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:17,916
What's he saying?

343
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,416
[LUIS] Do it!

344
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,750
Call out my name and show
this boy what you really are!

345
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:25,291
My Master.

346
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:27,041
[LUIS] Louder.

347
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:29,416
You are my... Master!

348
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,125
[LUIS]
Say it again!

349
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:32,875
You'll always be my Master!

350
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:34,500
[LUIS]
Did I say stop?

351
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:35,166
You'll always be--

352
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:36,166
[KAZUYA] Enough!

353
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:39,000
You don't have to
do what he says!

354
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:43,416
[LUIS] No one's making
her do anything.

355
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,250
What have you done to her?

356
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:48,000
What kind of sick game
are you playing?

357
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:50,291
Oh, it's not a game, Mr. Aoi.

358
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:54,458
Long before you two ever met,
she used to call me her Master.

359
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:57,708
That's just the kinda
girl Satella is.

360
00:18:57,791 --> 00:18:59,916
She's different now! Agh!

361
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:04,416
Kazuya! Ahh!

362
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:06,333
Let her go!

363
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:08,125
You wanna know
who she really is?

364
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:10,291
She'll do anything
I tell her to.

365
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:11,666
Won't you, my little toy?

366
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,250
[SATELLIZER gasps]

367
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,875
[whispers] Remove your shirt so
he can see what's underneath.

368
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:18,125
[SATELLIZER gasps]

369
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:23,000
[LUIS] Your Master just
gave you a direct order.

370
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:25,250
You will obey him.

371
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:28,583
[SATELLIZER] Yes.
Of course, Master.

372
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:34,541
[KAZUYA]
Satellizer, no!

373
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:36,375
Just stop!

374
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:40,833
[LUIS]
Now do you understand?

375
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:44,083
She's not even a person.
She's my marionette.

376
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:45,291
You're wrong.

377
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:47,375
You know nothing about her!

378
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:49,416
She's a great person!

379
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:50,625
[blows land]
Ahh!

380
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:52,083
Ugh!

381
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,625
Kazuya!

382
00:19:57,708 --> 00:20:01,375
Master. Please, stop!
He has nothing to do with this!

383
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:05,500
[LUIS] I don't remember
asking for your opinion!

384
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:06,875
[SATELLIZER yells]

385
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:12,000
[KAZUYA]
What's wrong with you?

386
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:15,166
How can you treat your own
sister like she's nothing?

387
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:18,000
Cause she is.

388
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:19,416
She's nothing to me.

389
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,583
[KAZUYA] Huh?

390
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:22,083
[LUIS]
She's the bastard daughter

391
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:24,416
of my father's whore mistress.

392
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,750
Out of kindness,

393
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:27,958
my father allowed her to
keep the El Bridget name.

394
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:31,416
And she'll do anything it
takes to remain in the family.

395
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,416
To remain in the family?

396
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,583
See.

397
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,500
Whenever she needs
a favor from my father,

398
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:38,625
she'll gladly start
wagging her tail for me,

399
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:40,333
like a filthy little dog.

400
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:42,416
I don't understand.

401
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,625
[SATELLIZER] Yes, and I hope
to put their status and power

402
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:49,083
to good use and accomplish
what Elizabeth could not.

403
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:50,666
[KAZUYA] Heh...

404
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:55,041
[KAZUYA] I don't care what
you say; I respect her.

405
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:56,958
She's not the marionette
you and the rest

406
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:59,500
of the El Bridget family
have made her out to be.

407
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:02,625
She's the smart, independent
woman I met at Genetics,

408
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:04,333
and have believed in ever since.

409
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:06,041
She's special.

410
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:07,500
[SATELLIZER gasps]

411
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:09,500
[KAZUYA] I've always known
her to be strong and brave.

412
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:11,291
To be the type of woman
who will always

413
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:13,958
stand up for the people
she cares about.

414
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:16,125
No matter what scars
you've left on her.

415
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:18,750
And no matter what pain
she carries because of you.

416
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:21,625
I respect her for the person
that she's become!

417
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:24,916
Yes! I love her
and I always will!

418
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,375
Well, that was something.

419
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:28,208
It sounded like a love poem.

420
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:30,291
A really terrible one,
but still.

421
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:31,708
If you're finished,

422
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:35,166
I think I'll shut that
big mouth of yours!

423
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,083
Holly, now!

424
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:40,791
[HOLLY]
Volt weapon deploy.

425
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,583
Excalibur Sword!

426
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:47,958
What, is that supposed
to frighten me?

427
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:50,250
I'd gladly lay down
my life for her.

428
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:52,708
I'd protect her no
matter what the cost.

429
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:54,708
If you wanna fight,
bring it on.

430
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:57,541
But I promise you this:
I am not afraid.

431
00:21:57,625 --> 00:21:59,083
Well. I guess
you'll have to

432
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:01,541
put your money where
your mouth is, my friend.

433
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:04,000
You can start by
lopping off his arms!

434
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:43,708
[LUIS] And I'll be the one who
is pulling your strings forever!

435
00:23:43,791 --> 00:23:44,541
[HOLLY]
If it weren't for you...

436
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:45,833
[SATELLIZER]
As of today,

437
00:23:45,916 --> 00:23:47,541
I won't let you have
any more control over me!

438
00:23:47,625 --> 00:23:49,875
Next time. Spellbound.
