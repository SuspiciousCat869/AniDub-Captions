in those types of wounds.

you describe it?

That's exactly what Chevalier

[ELIZABETH] Ever since
I was a little girl,

77
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:33,375
my father instilled in me
a sense of what's called

"noblesse oblige."

is called "noblesse oblige"?

You know what
that means, Eli?

83
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:43,333
It means the people
who are powerful

84
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:45,666
must always protect
those who are not.

85
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,333
It's our duty to help others.

it means, Daddy, I do.

I promise I'll never
forget it, either.

[ELIZABETH] That's exactly
why I'm going to do this.

It's my duty, Andrei.

95
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:14,708
[ELIZABETH] I promised my
father I would always protect

96
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,708
those who are weaker, and in
this case, it's the E-Pandora.

97
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:19,083
No one else is
looking out for them,

98
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:22,083
and without my help,
they'll continue to die.

99
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:27,333
If any harm comes to me or
my family because we tried to

100
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:30,833
save the lives of those who need
to be protected, then so be it!

101

Do you understand?

102
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:34,833
My Noblesse Oblige demands
that I help the E-Pandora.

103
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:37,166
And I'll die trying, if need be.

Please, enlighten me.

Why did you leak

[ELIZABETH] Because.
What you're doing here is wrong.

isn't ready, sir.

You knew it could result
in Nova transformation

with it and as a result Jina--

the decisions here?!

As a Pandora, it is your job

Leaking highly-classified

is a serious offense,

Yeah. It's weird,

she hasn't come back since

the shots around here.

The duty of a Pandora is simply
to follow Chevalier's orders.

00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:41,458
This one foolishly believed that
she could ignore those orders.

211

She must be taught that
her only two options are

obedience or death.

The Mark IV wasn't even
close to being ready

so Chevalier did the
only thing it could do.

They lied and said it
was fully operational

into the E-Pandora Project.

However, spying on Chevalier
is a serious offense,

went against regulations,

314
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,375
but it was the only way
to get the truth out

315
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:27,541
and put an end to
the E-Pandora Project!

any more E-Pandora die!

one of the few people here

It's nothing.

Uhh...

[SATELLIZER] Kazuya! I see
a Burger Queen over there!

00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:33,041
Do you think you could
go get me something?

331

I'm so hungry!

Oh, pretty please?

I wonder how Elizabeth's
dealing with it.

I mean--your family is.

They're major players in
the world, aren't they?

Yes, and I hope to put

I don't know. But...

[KAZUYA] So... is that
why we came here?

Only in a manner
of speaking.

I serve as the acting manager.

and came to see them.

convince you to talk

to them yourself?

down my life for her.

matter what the cost.
