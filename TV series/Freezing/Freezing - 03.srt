1
00:00:20,125 --> 00:00:21,500
Hello, I'm Kazuya Aoi...

2
00:00:21,583 --> 00:00:23,541
It's a pleasure to meet you all.

3
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:25,250
Woah!

4
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:26,666
What is it, Miss Hiiragi...?

5
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:27,875
Something caught your eye?

6
00:00:27,958 --> 00:00:29,833
No, it's nothing
like that, ma'am!

7
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:33,791
Well, you can take a seat
at any desk that's available.

8
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:35,375
Ma'am.

9
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:38,083
Wow, he's really cute!

10
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:39,791
Yeah, just my type!

11
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:41,541
He certainly
got your interest up!

12
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:44,416
Oh, stop it... That's
how rumors get started.

13
00:00:46,791 --> 00:00:48,083
That's odd...

14
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:50,458
I thought Arthur was
supposed to be in this class.

15
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,458
You should really be
in class now, Arthur...

16
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:30,125
I wouldn't want you getting

17
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:31,666
into any kind of
trouble for skipping.

18
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:32,833
Don't worry, Ganessa...

19
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:34,000
Nothing's more
important than being here

20
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:36,333
with my one and only "sister"...

21
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,541
And as your Limiter,

22
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:40,000
it only makes sense
that I'm by your side.

23
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:42,625
Well, if you simply must insist
on seeing things that way,

24
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:45,375
then I suppose I can't
stop you from staying.

25
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:46,541
What happened...?

26
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:48,125
Last I heard, you'd
won the Carnival...

27
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:50,333
How'd you end up in here?

28
00:02:50,416 --> 00:02:51,291
Never mind that!

29
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:53,250
It doesn't concern you!

30
00:02:57,166 --> 00:02:58,500
Hi there!

31
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:02,000
My name is Kaho Hiiragi,
I'm our class rep.

32
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:03,291
Pleased to meet you!

33
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:05,750
Nice to meet you
too, Miss Hiiragi.

34
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:10,291
This is the kind of
food they serve here...?

35
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:11,708
And it's really
all you can eat?!

36
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,750
Yeah, we do get some
pretty decent perks...

37
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:15,625
But it's only natural
considering that the future

38
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:18,250
of the human race rests
on our shoulders and all.

39
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:20,750
Right... That does make sense.

40
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:23,375
What's that big line over there?

41
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:24,916
That's Burger Queen...

42
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,041
You have to pay to eat there,

43
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:28,041
but it's become
pretty trendy lately...

44
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:30,583
Even though eating
too much makes you fat.

45
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:36,791
I saw you yesterday, y'know.

46
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:38,000
Huh?

47
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:39,166
"Just leave her alone...!

48
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,000
You've already won,
haven't you...?!

49
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:43,041
Isn't that enough?!"

50
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:45,208
But why would you
protect someone like her?

51
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:46,291
Someone like who?

52
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:48,750
The Untouchable Queen, duh!

53
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:50,083
It's because I'm
the one who got her

54
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:51,958
into all that trouble
in the first place.

55
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:53,625
What do you mean?

56
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:55,291
I think Satellizer would
have easily won the Carnival

57
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:58,500
if I hadn't blundered in like
an idiot and distracted her.

58
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:00,125
Are you saying that
the only reason Ganessa

59
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:03,041
defeated the Queen was
because you got in the way?

60
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:08,708
I see you've already introduced
yourself to the new kid.

61
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:11,458
Arthur!

62
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:12,666
It's probably a good idea not

63
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,208
to tell Arthur anything
you just said to me.

64
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,791
And I'd also suggest if you
want to stay in good health,

65
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:20,541
you steer clear of the
Untouchable Queen from now on.

66
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:22,041
How come?

67
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:24,458
Let's just say she doesn't
do so well with other people.

68
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:27,458
There's something
really off about her.

69
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:28,958
What's with all the whispering?

70
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:30,583
That's a terrible
thing to say...!

71
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:32,541
It's not nice to spread
rumors about someone

72
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:34,791
you barely even know!

73
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:40,791
Wait... Who now?

74
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:42,541
Satellizer.

75
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:47,875
Oh man, it's the
Untouchable Queen!

76
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,666
No! That's a bad idea!

77
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:59,250
Satellizer, wait.

78
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:04,916
He... touched her!

79
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:20,333
He touched me, but I didn't
feel those horrible sensations.

80
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:23,958
Hey! Wait!

81
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:31,916
Here.

82
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,458
I'm pretty sure these are yours.

83
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,166
I don't want to
take up your time,

84
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,625
but please listen to
what I have to say...

85
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:44,583
I wanted to apologize...
for what I did at the Carnival.

86
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:47,625
I also believe that when
you went into Pandora mode

87
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:49,666
and got into all that trouble,

88
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,791
you only did so because
of my interference.

89
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:58,208
The only reason I did it was
because you tried to help me.

90
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:01,083
I was only... paying you back...

91
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:02,791
That's all there was to it...

92
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:06,625
For me... it's... important
to pay back my debts.

93
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:10,250
I'm glad to hear it.

94
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:12,958
It's just as I thought...

95
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:16,208
You truly are a good
and decent person at heart.

96
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:25,625
Usually when other
people touch me,

97
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:28,541
the sensation is so awful
I can barely stand it,

98
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:32,333
but for some reason,
with you, it's not like that.

99
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,916
Satellizer, please.

100
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,083
I'd like you to consider
selecting me to be your Limiter.

101
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:43,000
And here I was doing
everything I could

102
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:46,416
to keep him as far away
from her as possible!

103
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,000
Oh, I'm sorry, I haven't
even introduced myself yet.

104
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:51,500
My name's Kazuya Aoi,
I'm a new student here.

105
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:53,000
Wait, Aoi...?

106
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:54,458
Are you trying
to say that you're--

107
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:57,791
My, you two picked a
silly place for a baptism.

108
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:00,083
Baptism?

109
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:01,250
Oh, that's right.

110
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:03,375
You just transferred
here, didn't you...?

111
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:06,000
When a Pandora and a Limiter
agree to become partners,

112
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:08,291
they perform what
we call a baptism.

113
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:11,000
Of course, this might not
be the best place for it.

114
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:13,875
It's much more special if
you wait until you're alone.

115
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:16,833
Unless you're into
strangers watching...

116
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:18,166
And who are you, miss?

117
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:21,958
"The Releaser of Chastity,"
Miyabi Kannazuki...

118
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:24,958
I'm a third year.

119
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:27,833
That's a cute nickname but it's
definitely not the one I heard.

120
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:30,083
She's the
"Limiter Eater," right?

121
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:32,000
The one and only...

122
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:33,791
She baptizes any
good-looking Limiter

123
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:35,208
she can get her
hands on and then,

124
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:36,583
once she gets bored,

125
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:39,166
she'll take away her
Stigmata and toss them aside.

126
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,250
You don't mean
to say that she...

127
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:42,708
You want me to spell it out...?!

128
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:44,666
She's not even remotely
interested in using her powers

129
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:47,291
to fight against the Nova.

130
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,666
Hey, is everything okay?

131
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:57,333
Stop right there.

132
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:59,833
Do you actually think a
second year can walk away

133
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:02,375
without acknowledging
a senior...?

134
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:05,125
Is that it?

135
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:09,583
Hey, wait for me!

136
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:14,000
No, why don't you
wait up a moment?

137
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:18,250
I'd be more than willing to
let you receive my baptism.

138
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:23,000
Sorry... I guess I don't
understand what you're--

139
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:24,458
Then let me make it clearer...

140
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:28,041
I wanna hear you say you'll
let me be your big sister.

141
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:33,291
I can make your life on campus a
much more enjoyable experience.

142
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:36,916
I'm sorry... you'll
have to forgive me,

143
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,208
but you're not the one
I want to be baptized with.

144
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,375
You stupid bastard!

145
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:48,583
Did you honestly believe
I'd let you walk away

146
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:51,083
unpunished after insulting me?

147
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:59,833
If you dare to lay even
one finger on this boy,

148
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:02,083
then I assure you
you'll regret it.

149
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:03,291
Why would the
Untouchable Queen do that

150
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:04,791
for Kazuya of all people?

151
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:05,833
What is she thinking?

152
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:07,125
She's a year behind Miyabi!

153
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:09,375
There's no way
she can take her on!

154
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:13,708
You've made a terrible mistake
underestimating me, girl.

155
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:21,833
I wonder how best to teach
you this valuable lesson...

156
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:23,166
...so you'll never
be foolish enough

157
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,916
to challenge a senior again...!

158
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,458
Homing Dagger!

159
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:49,250
And what skills will you
entertain me with, I wonder.

160
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:55,708
Well... I'm impressed...
and such good form...

161
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:57,708
However.

162
00:09:57,791 --> 00:09:59,125
Where'd she go?!

163
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:02,708
Can you keep up with my speed?

164
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:05,500
That's a maneuver they
teach you as a third year!

165
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:07,375
Accelerating Turn!

166
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Wait, Satellizer can do it, too?

167
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:40,208
What a surprise...!

168
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:42,166
The Accelerating Turn's
an elite skill

169
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,041
that's certainly not
taught to second-years...

170
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:46,041
Yet you've already mastered it.

171
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,041
You live up to
your reputation...

172
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:51,541
Satellizer el Bridget!

173
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:58,000
Miss Miyabi!

174
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,333
I didn't expect that...

175
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:19,041
How intriguing.

176
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:22,125
All I had planned to do was
teach you a little lesson,

177
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:24,625
but we've gone
way beyond that, now.

178
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:28,125
Yes... we're past
the point of no return!

179
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:30,166
I'm changing the game,

180
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,916
you frigid bitch
of a second-year...!

181
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,666
I'll force you to dine
on a full course

182
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:36,791
of humiliation until
you damn well choke!

183
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:41,666
We're all awaiting your
command, Miss Miyabi.

184
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:44,291
Now, Ereinbar Set!

185
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:55,208
All three of them at once?!

186
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:57,041
Freezing Area!

187
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:00,666
Tell me...!

188
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,000
How do you like
the feel of a Freezing

189
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:04,500
from three Limiters at once?

190
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,083
And here you are without

191
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:07,875
even one Limiter to
help you against me!

192
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:10,041
Admit it, you're at my mercy!

193
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:15,250
What the--Even if the
casting still isn't complete,

194
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:16,583
there's no way
she should be able

195
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:19,166
to jump like that
inside the Freezing area!

196
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:21,375
I have to get out of here!

197
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:25,416
Oh no, Kazuya!

198
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:27,208
Your hand!

199
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:29,541
Thank you, miss!

200
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:36,541
Satellizer!

201
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:42,791
Freezing is... complete.

202
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:45,833
Serves you right,

203
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:48,166
paying attention to that boy
in the middle of our fight...

204
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:51,250
How many ways do you
plan on disrespecting me?

205
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:55,708
It's not too late
to make amends...

206
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:57,500
You could start by
begging forgiveness

207
00:12:57,583 --> 00:13:00,541
for this terrible
wound you've inflicted!

208
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:07,541
That's enough!
Please let her go!

209
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:12,083
Repeat after me, "Miyabi,
can you ever forgive me

210
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:15,208
for being such an
insufferable bitch?"

211
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:21,583
Please... let the boy go.

212
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:30,333
Stop! How can you be so cruel?!

213
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:31,916
Oh, look.

214
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,791
It appears we've got another one
here in sore need of a lesson.

215
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,583
Whatever you say... Miss Miyabi.

216
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:51,958
I must say, you're
impressively endowed.

217
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:53,208
It's such a shame

218
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:56,625
that you insist on being
the Untouchable Queen.

219
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:57,333
No!

220
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:59,791
No...? Why's that...?

221
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:02,041
It's about time someone
showed you how good it feels

222
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:05,250
to have another person
touching you like this.

223
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:07,375
That's it... you
feel it, don't you...?

224
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:09,791
I can tell you're
starting to enjoy it...

225
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:12,375
I'll keep this up
'til you finish.

226
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:13,791
Stop it!

227
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:15,125
Like I said before...

228
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:17,333
I'll force you to swallow
your fill of disgrace

229
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:20,833
and humiliation until you
can't handle any more...!

230
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:22,916
We're only just beginning!

231
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:27,208
Oh my, such a provocative
pose you're giving us...

232
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:29,250
One would think that
the Untouchable Queen

233
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:31,583
has a great desire
to be touched.

234
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:33,041
No...! Stop it!

235
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:34,458
You're off to a good start,

236
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:37,916
but I'm sure we could
make this more stimulating...

237
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,958
Fortunately, I know how
we can improve the view.

238
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:45,541
Come to think of it, these
are a distraction as well.

239
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,416
Now that's more like it!

240
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:58,500
What kind of monster are you?!

241
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:01,375
It'd be a shame to keep this
glorious view to ourselves,

242
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:03,000
wouldn't you gentlemen agree...?

243
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:05,000
You know what to do.

244
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:06,625
Cameras at the
ready, Miss Miyabi.

245
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:08,500
Take as many as you can...

246
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:09,708
Make sure we have enough

247
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:12,083
for everyone in the
school to enjoy...

248
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:14,625
After today, the fabled
Untouchable Queen

249
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:17,375
will have to find
herself a new title!

250
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:21,916
That's enough...!

251
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,833
You've gone too far!

252
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:27,291
Leave her alone!

253
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:33,791
He was able to cancel out
their combined Freezing...

254
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:36,541
...while casting a
Freezing on me...?!

255
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:40,041
Impossible...! No Limiter
has that much power!

256
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:41,875
It doesn't make any sense.

257
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:43,875
He shouldn't be able
to cast a Freezing at all

258
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:46,375
without an Ereinbar Set!

259
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:54,500
Good afternoon, you two!

260
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:57,250
Chiffon! We need your help!

261
00:15:57,666 --> 00:16:00,208
Please, hurry! It's really bad!

262
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,750
Please... Please,
I'm begging you...

263
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:11,833
Just... just let me walk away...

264
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:14,791
...and I swear you'll
never see me again.

265
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:18,166
Stop this at once!

266
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:25,250
How could she do
something like this?

267
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,208
I order you to put
away your Volt Weapon

268
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:29,500
and step away from
Miyabi this instant...!

269
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:31,750
Remember that I'm student
council president!

270
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:34,291
Just in time...
Thank goodness...

271
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:38,916
Well, it's just a clear
violation of school regulations,

272
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,208
so I'd be eternally grateful

273
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:44,666
if she would comply with my
instructions right about now.

274
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:51,750
Miss Yumi...! Miss Elise!

275
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:56,541
Don't do it!

276
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:01,916
Was that a... Freezing effect?

277
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,333
It's him again.

278
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:04,750
Satellizer, please listen to me!

279
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:06,458
You've go to stop this!

280
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:07,708
I know you're angry...!

281
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:09,291
I saw everything
that happened...!

282
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,166
What Miyabi did to
you was unforgivable,

283
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:14,708
but don't do this!
It's gone too far!

284
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,208
It's not just Stigmata
that I carry on my back,

285
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:24,458
I carry all of your
hopes and dreams as well.

286
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:28,333
We Pandora carry the hopes
and dreams of the whole world,

287
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:31,166
because we're the only ones
who can defeat the Nova.

288
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:35,500
And all of those hopes... will
give me... strength.

289
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:37,166
You know that the
Pandora weren't created

290
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,208
to fight against each
other like this...!

291
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:41,291
This is wrong!

292
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:12,291
Well?

293
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:13,708
Well, what do you think?

294
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:16,125
He's Kazuha Aoi's little
brother, every last bit of him.

295
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:17,416
And what's that
supposed to mean?

296
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,166
Pandora can activate
shared sensations

297
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,625
with their male partner...

298
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:22,833
That's made possible when a
Stigmata that's matured

299
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:24,958
within the Pandora
for at least a year

300
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:27,500
is transplanted into
the chosen Limiter...

301
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:28,791
That's how the Ereinbar Set

302
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:31,625
allows both to experience
a sensation that is,

303
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:35,666
well, you know, whenever the
Freezing area is generated.

304
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,791
Yeah, thanks for the
refresher course...

305
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:40,250
Now how 'bout you explain why
Kazuya was able to generate

306
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:43,666
a Freezing without the
benefit of an Ereinbar Set.

307
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,708
Relax. I'm getting to it.

308
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:46,916
Pandora usually have about

309
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,666
two to four matured
Stigmata inside them...

310
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:52,250
Kazuha, as you know,
was an exception...

311
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:53,541
Take a look at this...

312
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:55,500
she had more than
twenty mature Stigmata,

313
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:58,916
which certainly explains why
she was such a powerful Pandora.

314
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,458
Twenty.

315
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:03,416
Kazuya's got the same
number of Stigmata in his body.

316
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,875
But that shouldn't be possible.

317
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:06,041
Kazuya's a boy...

318
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:07,791
He'll be unable to
mature any of those,

319
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:08,875
and what's more there's the--

320
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:10,958
Just look at this...

321
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:12,291
This is Kazuya's bioscan...

322
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:15,208
This is classified
Level A material,

323
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:18,375
so it's actually way off limits
for me to have access to it.

324
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:20,083
Oh, Elise! Not again!

325
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:21,791
Incredible as it may
seem, more than 30%

326
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:25,333
of his bone structure is
made up of Stigmata.

327
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:27,125
How did his body get like that?

328
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:29,166
Same way as Kazuha, I'd imagine.

329
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,166
You're talking about
the government!

330
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,750
You're saying that Genetics
knew all about this

331
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:34,208
and they still sent him here...!

332
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:35,708
What about Kazuya?

333
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:38,250
Does he know anything about
his or his sister's makeup?

334
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:40,000
Since the Stigmata
can't be detected

335
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:41,666
during a normal
medical screening...

336
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:44,041
He probably has no idea.

337
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:46,291
You're absolutely
sure you don't want me

338
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:48,083
to take you to
the nurse's office?

339
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:51,333
Thanks. I appreciate
the offer, but I'm fine.

340
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:53,166
I wish you had listened
to my warnings...

341
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,583
You've got to stay away
from that girl from now on...

342
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:57,750
You'll have to be
more careful as well.

343
00:19:57,833 --> 00:19:58,958
What do you mean?

344
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:01,083
She attacked an upperclassman...

345
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:03,791
Satellizer has gone
much too far this time...

346
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:05,208
The school hierarchy here

347
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:07,416
is treated like a
military ranking system...

348
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,583
It's absolute...

349
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:10,000
The third years aren't going

350
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,750
to forgive a second year
attacking one of their own...

351
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:13,791
They've barely tolerated
Satellizer's actions up

352
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:16,166
until now,
but once this gets out...

353
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:18,083
...they will come after her.

354
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:30,291
Target is confirmed as Type R...

355
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:33,125
I estimate its Freezing radius
at two hundred meters.

356
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:34,875
I'll only need forty seconds.

357
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:37,333
Don't worry, I'll be good
for at least two minutes.

358
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:42,333
Activating Ereinbar Set!

359
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:50,041
Freezing!

360
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:08,958
Tempest Turn!

361
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:27,583
Still one minute
twenty seconds remaining...

362
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:30,166
You took exactly
forty seconds...

363
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,583
Excellent work, Ingrid!

364
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:33,958
You too, Leo... Well done.

365
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:37,250
You did a better
job than me, ma'am.

366
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:38,583
Idiot.

367
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:47,916
You live up to your name:

368
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,250
"The Protector of Order,"
Ingrid Bernstein...

369
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:54,333
It's no wonder you're
the seventh-ranked student.

370
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:56,416
What the hell do you think
you're doing here, Attia?

371
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,833
Any reason I can't be...?

372
00:21:57,916 --> 00:22:00,041
It sounds like you're
not pleased to see me.

373
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:01,291
Excuse me.

374
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:05,000
One of our second years...
needs protection.

375
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:06,375
Which one?

376
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:09,208
The Untouchable
Queen, of course.

377
00:23:41,333 --> 00:23:42,500
There's no way I can beat her

378
00:23:42,583 --> 00:23:44,166
if I treat this like
a normal fight!

379
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:46,041
Fine, I'll give you
one last chance...

380
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:48,291
I will become
Satellizer's Limiter!

381
00:23:48,375 --> 00:23:50,083
Next time: "Tempest Turn"!
