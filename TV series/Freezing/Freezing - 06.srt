1
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:27,791
Satellizer?

2
00:00:30,625 --> 00:00:32,083
Don't tell me...

3
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:35,083
You weren't here all night
just for me, were you?

4
00:00:37,541 --> 00:00:38,791
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:38,875 --> 00:00:41,000
You were nice enough to
invite me to your room...

6
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:44,291
I just... I wish I'd
been able to make it.

7
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:45,875
It's all right.

8
00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:50,083
We still got to spend the
night together... kind of.

9
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:52,875
In that case... it was
a wonderful room entry...

10
00:00:52,958 --> 00:00:54,250
Unless you're unhappy.

11
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:55,458
No, not at all!

12
00:00:55,541 --> 00:00:58,333
Then... I guess
I'll be going now.

13
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,250
Hello! I am named
Rana Linchen...!

14
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:44,000
Pleased to meet you...!

15
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:47,416
I hope to make many new
friends here at West Genetics!

16
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:51,125
It's her!

17
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,500
Perhaps you would like to
wait for him here with me...?

18
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:57,333
I think he will be allowed
to have visitors soon.

19
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:00,916
Rana is a year older
than most of you,

20
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,541
but transferred here
as a second-year

21
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:05,083
so she could learn the
basics of being a Pandora.

22
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:06,833
I'd like you all
to treat her kindly

23
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:08,541
and teach her what you can!

24
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:10,833
Yes, ma'am!

25
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:14,875
Now, Rana, as for your desk...

26
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:16,875
This one will do just fine...

27
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:19,291
If no one minds, that is.

28
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:22,083
It doesn't bother me.

29
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:26,458
I look forward to working
with you, neighbor.

30
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:28,625
You must be curious...

31
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:29,833
Would you like me to tell you

32
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:33,291
why I was at the
recovery center last night?

33
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:36,625
It is because Mr. Kazuya
is the man of my destiny.

34
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:38,125
What?

35
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:41,208
It is only natural that I would
want to be by his side...

36
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:43,000
...do you not agree?

37
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:54,916
Hey, Rana...

38
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:57,625
Just use your stigmata!

39
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:02,291
Volt Texture... Equip.

40
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:08,166
See, I told you it'd
work like a charm, huh?

41
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,666
Oh my, this is quite
convenient--thank you!

42
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,250
No kidding...!

43
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:14,833
Once you get used to it, you can
even use it for your underwear!

44
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:19,708
It is because Mr. Kazuya
is the man of my destiny.

45
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:23,000
I don't understand her...

46
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:25,916
What does she think she's doing?

47
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,250
All right girls, today we'll

48
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,833
be having freestyle
battles with no Limiters...

49
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:32,750
Each round will
last three minutes.

50
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:34,833
Now this is just
a training exercise,

51
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:36,916
so I want you all to play fair.

52
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,500
Well, miss transfer student,

53
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:41,250
shall I show you how we
operate at West Genetics...?

54
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:44,958
Even country bumpkins deserve
a proper welcome, after all.

55
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:48,250
Volt weapon: Deploy...!

56
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:50,708
Chains of binding!

57
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:54,875
Four Mindsets!

58
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:56,416
That's her Volt Weapon...?

59
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,916
Gloves and boots?

60
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,666
She's fast!

61
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:05,583
She got her!

62
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:07,833
I see!

63
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:09,500
She's a close-range fighter!

64
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:16,875
Nice kick...

65
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:18,000
You don't look like much,

66
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:20,250
but you're not half
bad for a rookie!

67
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:24,416
And your wits are as
sharp as your tongue!

68
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:26,916
If you're trying
to aggravate me,

69
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,625
I must admit, you're
doing an excellent job!

70
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:34,875
No way out...

71
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:41,375
She hit all of her
blind spots at once!

72
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:42,208
Of course!

73
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:43,958
That's Ganessa's specialty!

74
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:47,166
She took the hit...

75
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,875
but she protected
all her vital points!

76
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:51,583
Cheeky girl...!

77
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:55,416
I think I'll have to
put you in your place!

78
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:01,083
By the way, do you know

79
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:02,916
when the best time
to counter attack is...?

80
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,708
After surviving your opponent's
strongest technique.

81
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:07,916
You can't damage a
Pandora from that range,

82
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,916
you're too close--

83
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:13,458
That's enough...! Good job...

84
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:16,375
Take note everyone, that's the
kind of battle I like to see!

85
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:18,208
Oh, wow...! Awesome!

86
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:22,375
Looks like Rana's gonna give
our rank 1 a run for her money!

87
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:26,333
Our little transfer student is
quite intriguing, isn't she...?

88
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:28,041
Just like Attia said.

89
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:29,250
No kidding...

90
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:31,000
Could you feel that
power coming from her?

91
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:32,458
Well, that settles it...

92
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:36,666
if we're all agreed, I say
let's proceed with the plan.

93
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:37,625
You look a lot better.

94
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:40,208
Have your injuries healed?

95
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:41,416
Everything's good.

96
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,833
More importantly...

97
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:44,416
Please tell me that you've
finally changed your mind

98
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,666
about teaming up with
the Untouchable Queen.

99
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,083
Not this again...

100
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:49,833
Look, we're just
worried, okay...?

101
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:51,375
If you hadn't gotten
involved with her,

102
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:55,000
those girls probably wouldn't
have beat you up like that.

103
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:56,791
Can't you guys
drop it already...?

104
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:59,250
And what's with people calling
her the "Untouchable Queen"--

105
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:01,208
where did that come
from in the first place?

106
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:02,541
It's something she did.

107
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:04,125
Like what?

108
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:07,708
She injured a Limiter so badly,
he'll never be able to recover.

109
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:08,916
I see...

110
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,625
Truth is... she went
to East Genetics

111
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:12,166
before she
transferred here...

112
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,250
But it wasn't just
a change of schools,

113
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:17,958
she got kicked out because
she caused too much trouble.

114
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:19,375
It happened two years ago,

115
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:21,875
so she's had a bad reputation
for a long time now...

116
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:23,750
That's why people avoid her.

117
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:25,166
Who was the Limiter?

118
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,291
What happened?

119
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:28,000
Before Satellizer
transferred schools,

120
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:31,291
there was a Limiter at East
Genetics named Brooks Leevon.

121
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:33,250
He was one of the
best in his class,

122
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:35,458
and supposedly really
good-looking, too,

123
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:37,500
which made him really
popular with the girls.

124
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,958
Even though he probably
had plenty of options,

125
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:42,583
he decided to team
up with Satellizer.

126
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:47,500
In other words... you might be
making the same mistake he did.

127
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:50,833
And it was a mistake that
ended his life as a Limiter.

128
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:56,125
Thanks to her,
he'll never recover...

129
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:57,875
Even though he was
a star student,

130
00:07:57,958 --> 00:07:59,958
he had to give up
and drop out of school.

131
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:02,416
Anyway, after that,
Satellizer was suspended

132
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,583
for a whole year...

133
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:05,416
She transferred here
to get a new start.

134
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,333
She already got held
back her second year

135
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:09,041
thanks to the suspension
and at this rate,

136
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:11,125
I'm afraid history
might repeat itself.

137
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:12,458
She hasn't been here that long

138
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:14,416
and she's already injured
a second-year Limiter

139
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,791
that touched her by accident...
it was pretty bad.

140
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:18,791
And now she's fighting
with Pandora too...

141
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:19,958
You've seen for yourself

142
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,666
how quick she is to
fly off the handle.

143
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,291
We're just trying
to look out for you...

144
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:25,291
You do understand that, right?

145
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:26,583
It would be best to get out now

146
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:29,458
before you end up
getting hurt a second time.

147
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:32,958
Mr. Kazuya!

148
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:34,000
Hello...!

149
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:35,583
You look well.

150
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:36,666
Is your body all healed?

151
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,166
Yeah... my body's fine.

152
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,916
By the way, that uniform
looks great on you.

153
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,208
Oh, you really think so...?

154
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:46,458
I am most happy to hear it!

155
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:48,750
To tell you the truth,
I am partial to it, too.

156
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:49,791
Good...!

157
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:51,291
It must be a big
change for you, huh?

158
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:53,166
Yes, but it allows
Kunlun's Tears

159
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,916
to store my old
clothes, as well...

160
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,291
It was strange at first,

161
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:58,875
but it is much more
convenient than stripping naked!

162
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:03,000
Oh! Arthur and I have
a really important errand

163
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:04,208
to take care of...

164
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:06,333
So... we'd better
get going... right?

165
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:08,208
Oh...! Yeah, almost forgot!

166
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:09,416
You're not leaving...?!

167
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,750
Why don't you two

168
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:13,041
spend some quality time
together while we're gone?

169
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:15,583
Bye...! We'll see
you guys later!

170
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:17,375
Enjoy yourselves!

171
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:18,541
We will...!

172
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:19,958
Farewell, and best
of luck on your errand!

173
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:21,291
Gimme a break...

174
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:23,208
Oh, by the way
Miss Rana, I forgot,

175
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:25,458
you're a year older
than me, aren't you?

176
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:27,416
Sorry if I was rude before...

177
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,208
From now on, I'll address
you as my senior, okay?

178
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:31,541
There is no need
to concern yourself

179
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:32,750
with that sort of thing...!

180
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:33,875
In fact, I would much prefer it

181
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:36,541
if you simply called
me "Rana" instead!

182
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:39,625
Yeah, but I'm only a first
year--I don't want to be rude.

183
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:40,875
It's not rude!

184
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:43,875
As your senior, I insist
that you call me Rana!

185
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,416
Yes ma'am, I'm sorry...

186
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,333
I mean, uh, yes Miss Rana.

187
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:49,750
There is no need for
the "miss" or "ma'am."

188
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:51,666
That's easy for you to say...

189
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:54,833
But what if the other
upperclassmen heard me?

190
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:57,916
Please understand, Mr. Kazuya,

191
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,958
you are a very
special person to me...

192
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:02,125
So it does not bother me at all.

193
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:04,958
I know, but the issue is,
that it bothers me,

194
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:06,708
what do you mean
by "special" anyway?

195
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:08,750
Maybe I will tell you...

196
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:11,333
But you have to call
me "Rana" first...

197
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:13,625
Say it.

198
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:17,125
Fine! I get it already...!
I'll call you... Rana.

199
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:21,541
It is such a sweet sound to hear
coming from your sweet lips.

200
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:23,125
With that settled,

201
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:26,333
I think I will call you just
plain Kazuya from now on.

202
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:27,666
Sure... I mean...

203
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:31,000
I'm pretty sure that
wouldn't break any rules...

204
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:34,833
Look out, it's the
Untouchable Queen!

205
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:36,666
Uh...! Satellizer! Ma'am!

206
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,166
Greetings...!

207
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,416
Kazuya and I were just enjoying
our lunch break together,

208
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,875
but if you would like
to sit here with us,

209
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:44,333
I will not try to stop you!

210
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:46,000
I swear this isn't
what it looks like...

211
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:47,541
If Kazuya and
I being lovey-dovey

212
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:49,208
does not sit well with you...

213
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:52,041
Then find a seat
elsewhere, be my guest!

214
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:54,083
Hey, cut it out, Rana!

215
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:55,708
"Rana?"

216
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:56,750
No! Hold on...!

217
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:58,250
She asked me to call her that!

218
00:10:58,333 --> 00:10:59,875
I wanted to call her "miss"!

219
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:02,875
You can see Kazuya and I have
a very special relationship...

220
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:06,041
We have left silly
formalities far behind us!

221
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:09,791
Wait, please don't go!

222
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:12,541
We need to talk...
Come with me, Kazuya.

223
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:16,125
In case you have not noticed,
Kazuya is eating his lunch.

224
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:17,625
This is more important.

225
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:19,625
Yes, ma'am!

226
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:21,333
Sorry Miss--I mean, Rana...!

227
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:26,250
We can have lunch
together next time!

228
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:29,583
Well... I do suppose
I was rushing things a bit.

229
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:31,708
Excuse me...

230
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:34,583
Sorry to bug you...
but is this seat taken?

231
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:37,125
No... Please sit.

232
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:40,541
You must be the
new transfer student.

233
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:41,500
Yes, I am.

234
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:43,541
My name is Rana Linchen.

235
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:45,916
I'm Attia Simmons--a
third year...

236
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,833
It's a pleasure to
meet you... Welcome.

237
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:51,250
That first-year
you were talking to...

238
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:53,791
Kazuya Aoi was
his name, I think...?

239
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:56,333
I feel awfully sorry
for that poor boy.

240
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:57,750
Feel sorry for him?

241
00:11:57,833 --> 00:12:00,958
Oh, it's nothing really,
don't listen to me.

242
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:02,291
My goodness,

243
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:04,291
when will I ever learn
to stop running my mouth?

244
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:05,666
No, please...

245
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:09,291
If there is any way I can help,
you have to tell me.

246
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:22,041
So uh... what was it
you needed, ma'am...?

247
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:24,916
There was something important
you wanted to talk to me about?

248
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:28,125
From now on, could you...

249
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:29,166
Could I what?

250
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,916
Call me Satella?

251
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:33,208
There's no way...!

252
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:35,750
I mean, even if we're friends,
you're still my upperclassman!

253
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:39,208
But--I don't mind.

254
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:40,958
You can call me that...

255
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:43,500
No, you will call me that.

256
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,000
But Ma'am...

257
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:47,333
It's all right

258
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:49,083
because we're going to be
partners--like you said.

259
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:51,583
I think if we stopped
worrying about formalities,

260
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:54,083
it would be a good first step.

261
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:57,500
All right...

262
00:12:57,583 --> 00:12:58,791
Yeah, I think I understand.

263
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:01,583
I'll try... to be less formal...

264
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:03,458
Miss Satella, ma'am.

265
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:08,375
Well... At any rate...

266
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:10,875
Shall we eat lunch?

267
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:12,666
Burger Queen again, I see...

268
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,000
It's your favorite, huh?

269
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:18,500
Those two have such
a weird relationship.

270
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:20,791
They haven't even
performed their baptism...

271
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:22,791
But Aoi doesn't care one bit...

272
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:25,166
He still thinks of Satellizer
as his real partner,

273
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:26,541
like it's normal.

274
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:29,916
Satellizer is toying with him,
denying him baptism,

275
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,375
denying proof of
their partnership.

276
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:35,375
As it stands now, he's nothing
more than a servant to her...

277
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:37,000
He's letting her take
advantage of him just

278
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:39,541
because she's a little cute.

279
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:42,041
I wonder why she
changed her mind...

280
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:44,875
It really seemed like she
didn't want a partner before.

281
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:47,541
Kazuya Aoi isn't
like other Limiters.

282
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:50,875
He can cast Freezing Areas
even without a baptism.

283
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:52,125
I think it's obvious

284
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:55,500
that Satellizer is only
after him for his power.

285
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:58,291
She disabled that
Limiter for life...

286
00:13:58,375 --> 00:13:59,875
She's just using him.

287
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:03,083
And once his power's dried up,
she'll drop him in a heartbeat.

288
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:04,250
Even before she came here,

289
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:05,541
she beat up a
second-year Limiter

290
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:08,083
who accidentally touched her...

291
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:09,250
It's a pity...

292
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:11,125
Once he's ruined,
she'll find someone else

293
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:13,458
and start the whole
thing over again.

294
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:16,541
You must not forget...

295
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:18,833
...the man who makes
the Kunlun's Tears

296
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:21,958
within you quiver is
the one you must seek!

297
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:24,833
He is your destined partner!

298
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:28,791
I've finally met the
man of my destiny...

299
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:30,916
I cannot let him go.

300
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:32,875
I want the truth...

301
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:35,541
I have to find out why
she did what she did.

302
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:38,583
Your actions have corrupted
the Tears on your back...

303
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:40,750
I cannot allow
this to continue...

304
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:42,166
Satellizer...

305
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,291
...el Bridget!

306
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:54,041
Surely you are not that
surprised to see me.

307
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:55,625
What's that supposed to mean?

308
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:57,750
Well... what do you say you come

309
00:14:57,833 --> 00:15:00,708
with me for a
moment and find out?

310
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:04,500
You know, I still haven't had
a proper visit to her room...

311
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:06,958
I'm ready... Let's do this!

312
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:13,041
I thought that
would never end...!

313
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:15,166
Next time they try to
give me Simulation Center duty,

314
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,166
I'm totally gonna play sick.

315
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,916
All we have to do is
check on the users,

316
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,458
what's so bad about that?

317
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:22,333
It's way boring, that's what!

318
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:25,083
Oh? Is the center
already closed?

319
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:26,291
Oh my gosh, it's her!

320
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:29,458
It's... the Untouchable Queen!

321
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:32,333
Are you going to tell me
why you dragged me out here?

322
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:34,000
You are too close to Kazuya...

323
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:34,958
What?

324
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:36,500
You must remove yourself.

325
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:38,500
What do you mean "remove"?

326
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:40,208
You have no right
to tell me that.

327
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:42,708
No, you are the one who
does not have a right...!

328
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:46,708
You have not even performed a
baptism with him yet, have you?

329
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:49,666
I shall give Kazuya both
baptism and my partnership...

330
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,708
The two of us will become one!

331
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:54,708
You forget that Kazuya
has already paired with me.

332
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:57,708
If that is so, then why will
you not perform the baptism?

333
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:59,916
If the two of you are
to become a true pair,

334
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,250
trusting of both each
other's bodies and spirits,

335
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:04,791
then it is a
necessity, is it not?

336
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:06,708
No... we...

337
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:11,916
I don't even know why
we're talking about this...

338
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,750
It's none of your business.

339
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:15,208
Regardless of what you say,

340
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:17,666
Kazuya and I accept
each other as a pair.

341
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,625
So there's no
problem, alright...?

342
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:21,791
That's all I have
to say on the subject.

343
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:23,250
Do not run away!

344
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:25,833
You still have not answered me!

345
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:28,416
You owe this to him!

346
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:30,875
Don't touch me...

347
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:33,291
Don't you dare touch me!

348
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:39,958
If you insist on using
violence, so be it...

349
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:42,875
I agree to settle
this matter your way.

350
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:46,791
Prepare for battle,
Satellizer el Bridget!

351
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:55,000
I guess she must be out.

352
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,416
I wonder where
she could've gone...

353
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,708
What was that all about?

354
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:01,000
That girl with the
Untouchable Queen

355
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:04,000
was the new transfer
student, right?

356
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:06,166
Whatever! It's best
to stay out of this...

357
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,750
That much is for sure!

358
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:10,000
Ah... Excuse me?

359
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:13,458
Volt Weapon: deploy...!
Nova Blood!

360
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:16,291
Four Mindsets!

361
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,333
After I finish beating you,

362
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:21,291
you'll never interfere with
us again, do you understand?

363
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:23,250
After <i>I</i> finish beating <i>you,</i>

364
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:26,000
you will remove
yourself from Kazuya!

365
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:35,458
That's right--dance,
little puppets.

366
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:43,708
We are not done!

367
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:48,583
Not even close!

368
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:52,125
Acceleration... So that's it!

369
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,875
Once I have your
position locked down,

370
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:03,083
there is no escape!

371
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:12,250
Are those wings...?

372
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:13,958
She's glowing!

373
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,875
How did she cover
three meters so quickly?

374
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:25,333
I didn't even see her move...

375
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:27,375
We have only just begun

376
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:29,541
and I had to open the
Hallowed Gate to keep up...

377
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:31,625
I did not think you
would be so strong.

378
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:33,000
Hallowed Gate?

379
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:35,750
When I release the power
flow of my Kunlun's Tears...

380
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:38,083
their energy is transmitted
throughout my body...

381
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:41,208
pushing my physical capabilities
to a whole new level.

382
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:44,750
It is a technique of our
Hallowed Gate Baiji Quan style!

383
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,375
And now I shall
demonstrate the power

384
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:50,208
of the Hallowed Gate's
long distance strike...!

385
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:52,083
Kuga!

386
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:02,291
I have to figure out
her firing range.

387
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,208
Running away?

388
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:10,166
But things are just
starting to get interesting!

389
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:19,708
If you think that
technique will work now

390
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:20,958
that my Hallowed Gate is open,

391
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:23,000
I am afraid you are
greatly mistaken!

392
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:25,041
You cannot hide from me!

393
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:30,541
She accelerated a second
time to dodge my attack...!

394
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:32,625
A Double Acceleration?!

395
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:41,041
You attacked from
three directions at once

396
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:43,583
during your double
acceleration, correct?

397
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:45,083
I could not see a thing.

398
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:49,041
This has been quite
an amazing fight.

399
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:52,125
One that I'm about
to put an end to.

400
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:53,708
You are an interesting person,

401
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:56,416
Satellizer el Bridget,
though shortsighted...

402
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,958
But that is fine...

403
00:19:58,041 --> 00:20:01,041
If you think you can defeat me
so easily, go ahead and try.

404
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:03,875
I will take your attack head-on!

405
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:20,500
You have just sealed your fate.

406
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:22,791
Oh no.

407
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:24,666
Hallowed Gate Baiji Quan...

408
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:30,458
...short-range strike...
Say goodbye!

409
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,666
It is quite fortunate for me

410
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,916
that you are ignorant
of my fighting style...

411
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,291
Had you known of
that attack beforehand,

412
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:44,083
the outcome might
have been different.

413
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:47,625
Satellizer's double acceleration
and Rana's martial arts style,

414
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:49,666
they're too dangerous
for second years.

415
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:50,875
We were fools...

416
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:53,625
we cannot afford to
underestimate them.

417
00:20:56,708 --> 00:21:01,333
This isn't... over... yet.

418
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:02,875
My Enga should have
crushed your ribs

419
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:05,250
and damaged your
internal organs as well...

420
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:07,041
Yet still you fight.

421
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:10,458
I fight because I refuse
to be defeated by anyone...

422
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:12,500
These injuries
are nothing to me.

423
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,916
What are you doing?!

424
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:23,083
I'm sorry, but my partner
has already been decided!

425
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:24,666
I made an agreement
with Satellizer

426
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,083
and I'm sticking to it.

427
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:28,833
To a Pandora, her Limiter
is a cherished companion,

428
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:30,291
not a simple tool...

429
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:33,625
And yet you have not
honored him with baptism...

430
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:37,041
I must assume you are
using Kazuya for his power.

431
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:39,166
Pair up with me instead...

432
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:41,833
Do not let her take
advantage of you any longer.

433
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:43,833
You've got the
wrong idea about her...

434
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:47,250
Satellizer isn't trying to
use me or anything like that...

435
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:48,541
In fact, she wasn't even the one

436
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:50,666
who wanted to team up
in the first place.

437
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,666
All right, that's enough...

438
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:55,750
You've gone and
spoiled my little plan!

439
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:57,000
Why are you here?

440
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:58,958
Then again, I suppose
incidents like these add

441
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:01,750
to the charm of
live entertainment.

442
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:04,166
Now if you really
want to have fun,

443
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:07,041
why don't you play
with your big sisters?

444
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,083
Stay away...

445
00:23:42,166 --> 00:23:43,125
Oh, how exciting...!

446
00:23:43,208 --> 00:23:44,333
Now this is a
game worth playing!

447
00:23:44,416 --> 00:23:45,333
Don't touch me!

448
00:23:45,416 --> 00:23:46,958
I can't stand it anymore!

449
00:23:47,041 --> 00:23:48,375
Please, stop it!

450
00:23:48,458 --> 00:23:50,625
Next time: "Sanction."
