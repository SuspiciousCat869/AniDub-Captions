Can you confirm?

Three Chevalier

11
00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:47,916
locked in combat against
E-Pandora Rattle.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,708
She should be subdued soon.

Julia Munberk of Genetics
Germany Panzer is currently

15
00:00:55,416 --> 00:00:57,500
locked in combat with
the traitor Cathy Lockharte

16
00:00:57,583 --> 00:00:59,041
of East Genetics.

17
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:02,791
[SPENCER] Trap her. Seal all
bulkheads leading to that block.

18
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:04,416

Now sealing all bulkheads

leading to R-B
Block Area Two, sir.

20
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:17,500
So, I guess the plan
is to box me in

21
00:01:17,583 --> 00:01:19,500
and keep me fighting
until I get worn down,

22
00:01:19,583 --> 00:01:22,416
too bad for them because
I could do this all day.

23
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,333
How about you?

[FEMALE OPERATOR 10C] We've lost
the audio and video feeds.

26
00:01:44,458 --> 00:01:47,000
It must be due to all the
fighting in that block.

27
00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:49,333
Keep the Pandora we
sent to subdue Lockharte

on standby as a precaution.

29

On it, sir.

30
00:01:52,541 --> 00:01:54,458

She's currently locked
in combat against

[FEMALE OPERATOR 10D]
The blizzard seems to be

37
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:13,625
hindering the feed.
Shall I send reinforcements?

38
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:16,125
No. That's not necessary.

39
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:18,125
What about the other E-Pandora?

40
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:19,208
[FEMALE OPERATOR 10A]
We're currently tracking

41
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:21,208
Amelia Evans in C-D Block, sir.

42
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:24,208
She has two Pandora and a
Limiter accompanying her.

43
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:26,958
[SPENCER] Has anyone in the area
been summoned to subdue them?

44
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:29,458
That would be Chiffon Fairchild
of West Genetics

45
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:31,833
and she's already
laying in wait for them.

[AMELIA yells]

48
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:49,750
I'm afraid that I must
insist you stop.

49
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:54,916
Chiffon Fairchild.

50
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,625
[RANA] I take it you are
not here as an ally then?

51
00:02:57,708 --> 00:02:59,000
Of course I'm not.

52
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:01,083
Look, in case you haven't
realized it yet,

53
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:03,208
this is not West Genetics.

54
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:06,541
Which means I cannot simply
turn a blind eye to your actions

55
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:07,833
as I have in the past.

56
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:10,125
Disarm and surrender
immediately.

57
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,666
Surrender?

58
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:16,041
You make it sound as if you've
always been holding back.

59
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:17,541
So try and stop us.

60
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:21,041
Let's see how powerful the
Unparalleled Monster really is!

61
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:24,083
Maybe you'll get serious and
wipe that smile off your face.

62
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:25,458
Well that's too bad.

63
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:27,500
And here I thought that
I had always shown you

64
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:29,750
such special favor.

65
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:31,083
Very well then.

66
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:34,083
I'll stop you since that's
what you want me to do.

67
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:38,083
But, unfortunately, this smile
on my face isn't going anywhere.

68
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:40,083
I mean, after all.

69
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:42,583
I don't think I'll even
need to get serious.

70
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:45,666
It shouldn't be too difficult
to defeat all of you.

71
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,708
You can go ahead, Amelia!

72
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:57,916
Rana and I will
keep Chiffon busy!

important to take care of!

I can't let her escape!

79
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,750
What is it?
What're you reacting to?

80
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:11,250
Ahh! I can't
take any more!

81
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:13,500
The thought of you and me
going at it in sweaty,

82
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:15,250
hand-to-hand close
quarters combat

83
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,583
is getting me so hot
I think I'm gonna burst!

84
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:20,875
Uh. How can you even
think of that right now?

85
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:24,333
[JULIA] Looking at
your body, it's easy!

86
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:26,166
How 'bout a wager?

87
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,416
Wait, what?

88
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,166
Let's say the winner
of this fight

89
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:32,500
can do anything they want...

90
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:34,208
...to the loser.

91
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:37,125
[CATHY] That's insane!

92
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:39,125
Scared you'll lose?

93
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:41,000
Fine then.

94
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:43,125
I guess I'll just have to
overpower those silly little

95
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:46,125
Division Waves of yours and
teach you a little humility.

96
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:47,708
I've have to admit Cathy,

97
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:50,708
your Quattro Full
Acceleration is first class.

98
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:53,708
However, avoiding
my Division Waves

99
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:56,916
is impossible at any
speed below Mach Three.

100
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,541
With you moving so slowly,
there's no way you can win.

101
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:02,166
Then you're mine.

102
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,333
[CATHY chuckles]

103
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:04,833
What's so damn funny?

104
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:06,791
[CATHY] You're relying on old
data and armchair theory,

105
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:08,333
and not taking
into consideration

106
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:10,000
the techniques that
I've learned here.

107
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:12,375
Your provocation
is pointless.

108
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:14,250
Do you really think
you've learned enough

109
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:15,875
to defeat me in battle?

110
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:17,833
Well, since you
don't believe me,

111
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:20,000
why don't I put it
to the test for you?

112
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:22,625
Allow me show you
exactly what I've learned

113

from my battles
with Satellizer!

you're powerful enough

00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:02,833

annoying it's insulting!

activation of your Stigmata.

But that's suicide!

to stop this!

important things to worry about!

This is the only
chance we'll get.

134

make it out of this alive.

If the last thing I ever
see is you winning,

138

then so be it. My lady!

Have you lost your mind?!

140

I can't believe you're
actually willing to let

such a meaningless battle!

How dare you.

You've got no right
to call it meaningless

144

with all that's at stake here.

I'm fighting to stop
a great injustice.

00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:37,500
And Andrei is fighting
because he believes in me.

00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:35,750
How careless of me!

162
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:37,916
That looked like it
might've hurt you!

163
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,875
[CHIFFON] I can't hold
back when I'm fighting,

164
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:43,416
and that was just
my first punch,

165
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,083
so think how much worse
the next ones will be.

166
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:47,625
I hope you guys
surrender before

167
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:49,750
I end up ripping you
into little pieces.

168
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:53,666
I'll try to go easy on you,
but I can't make any promises.

00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,333
[SATELLIZER yells]

170
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,666
[RANA] Do not forget
I am also here!

171
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,583
[SATELLIZER]
Aaaaaahhh!

172
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,833
Oh my.

173
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:30,125
Your weapon, it just
broke so easily.

As shall you!

[CHIFFON]
Aaahh!

177
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,916
I did warn you not
to forget about me,

178
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,041
Miss Student
Council President! Aaahh!

179
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:47,041
Oh, no, look it
happened again!

180
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:50,666
I swear sometimes I just
don't know my own strength!

181
00:11:57,458 --> 00:11:59,250
Well, are you ready
to surrender yet?

182
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:02,083
Perhaps I should stop
you in your tracks too.

183
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:04,500
What do you think, Satellizer?

184
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:16,791
[SATELLIZER] Now I know...
why she's called a monster.

185
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:21,083
Just one attack
and I'm done for!

186
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:22,875

Pardon me.

[SATELLIZER gasps]

00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,916

stopped in their tracks?

[CHIFFON gasps]

190
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:37,000
[SATELLIZER] Right, we won't
be able to beat her

191
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:39,583
unless we give it
everything we've got!

192
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:45,708
You're both releasing
your Stigmata?

seriously think you'd won.

195
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:11,125
Take my advice and
give up already.

196
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:13,541
Accept it, you've lost.

[CHARLES] I will admit that your
determination is impressive.

202
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:29,500
But. In the end, I won.
And do you know why?

203
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:31,625
I'll do anything
to help my father's

E-Pandora Project succeed.

are at risk of failing!

00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:43,791
[ELIZABETH] What?
Who is your father?

209
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:46,166
Secretary Marks Spencer.

210
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,375
And I owe him everything.

216
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,291
[MALE DOCTOR 10B]
Look at her overflow numbers.

217
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:29,708
They're essentially zero.

218
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:32,125
In my opinion, she's perfectly
suited to be a Pandora.

219
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:34,916
[MALE DOCTOR 10C] Where did you
find someone so gifted?

220
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:42,333
[SPENCER] What would you do if
I asked you to become a Pandora?

221
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:44,000
Would you say yes?

222
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,291
Well, mister.

223
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:47,375
I'm sorry, I meant
to say father--

I would do...
anything you ask of me!

225

[CHARLES]
I love my father.

226
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:00,541
And that love is more important

227
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:02,791
than your concern
for the E-Pandora.

228
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:05,708
You'll never beat me,
Elizabeth.

229

It's been nice knowing you.

[ANDREI] You've gotta
be kidding me.

231
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:16,416
You think you're fighting for a
cause that's greater than Eli's?

Well then...

I'm gonna prove
why you're wrong!

[ELIZABETH] Thank you for
reminding me of that, Andrei.

243

After all, I'm still
Elizabeth Mably.

244

Even if my body is
bruised and broken.

Don't be dumb!

he's going to die!

Ugh! You got some
kinda' death wish?

I'm willing to do
whatever I have to!

250
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:18,625
I don't care what happens to me.
Only that Eli stops this!

00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:20,041
[CHARLES grunts]

252
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,250
Andrei.

253
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:29,041
Can you keep this up for
another thirty seconds?

254
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:32,291
[ANDREI]
Yes, my lady.

255
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:34,708
What's the thirty
seconds for?

256
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:40,458
I need it for my
Stigma Satellite System.

257
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,375
If it doesn't stabilize
its energy first

258
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:45,375
it'll create a lag that makes it
hard to hit an opponent.

259
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:48,541
Thirty seconds is the time
it needs to stabilize,

260
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:51,666
and line up...
the perfect shot.

261
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,291
You have to stop
this nonsense!

262
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:55,291
Are you really willing
to risk his life

263
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:57,333
over a bunch of girls
that you barely even know?

264
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:58,750
You're crazy!

265
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:01,416
You told me you'd do whatever
Spencer asked of you.

266
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,916
I assume that means
you're even willing

267
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,625
to risk your life, correct?

268
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:06,958
Andrei and I are
willing to do the same.

269
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:10,625
Not because we want
to please a madman.

270
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:13,458
But for a just cause that's
bigger than ourselves.

271
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:17,291
We're fighting for the E-Pandora
and that's why we'll beat you.

00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:45,125
[ELIZABETH]
You are strong.

280
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:47,625
But you're also overconfident.

281
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:51,416
And that is why I was able
to defeat you, Charles.

282
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:08,458
[ELIZABETH]
Andrei. Hold on, all right?

283
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:11,791
I'm going to save you.
I promise.

284
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:19,458
It's too late.
And... it's all your fault.

He's gonna die
because of you.

287
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:26,041
This could have been prevented
if you had just given up.

288
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:28,500
But you kept fighting
and look what happened.

289
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:31,166
Are you satisfied now?

290
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,750
Of course I'm
not satisfied!

292
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:35,375
What value could there be

293
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:37,958
in a victory gained
by losing a loved one?

294
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:40,041
But it was still necessary.

295
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:41,708
Why do you think
we would continue

296
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:44,291
to fight despite the
possibility of death?

297
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:48,166
Why did Andrei keep going
when he knew he might die?

298
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:52,125
Don't you dare pretend that
you don't know the answer!

299

Everybody has something

300

for which they would
risk everything.

301

Even you.

302
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:01,250
You're fighting for someone
you hold dear and so are we.

303
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:08,125
We need to get the medics down
to Charles, on the double.

you'd like. Go on.

all and I always honor my bets.

[SATELLIZER yells]

317
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:58,625
[RANA yells]

318
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:02,291
Aaaahhh!

319
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:06,625
[CHIFFON] 
Aaahh!

320
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:32,541
[CHIFFON]
It would seem...

321
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:39,250
...that I may need to
revise my nickname.

322
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:41,041
[RANA screams]

323
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,375
[CHIFFON]
You're both so strong.

324
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:48,333
Yet people call me a monster.

325
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:49,833
[SATELLIZER gasps]

326
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:53,041
You and Rana deserve to be
called monsters more than I do.

327
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:54,958
[SATELLIZER]
Chiffon...

328
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:57,125
Are you even human?

329
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:59,125
No, a Pandora?

330
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:01,750
It's not really like you to
start asking your opponent

331
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:04,166
questions in the middle
of a fight, Sattelizer.

332
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:07,666
But since this will probably be
our last one, I'll answer you.

333
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:12,208
If you absolutely must know...
I am a true Pandora.

334
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:14,416
[FEMALE OPERATOR 10A]
Amelia Evans has almost reached

335
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,833
Lab Zero!

336
00:21:15,916 --> 00:21:17,000
[FEMALE OPERATOR 10B]
Three Chevalier reinforcements

337
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:19,333
are moving in to intercept her!

338
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:23,916
That's Rattle's!

339
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:27,333
She's dead and
you will be, too.

340
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:30,416
So you should just drop
your weapon and give up now.

341
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,208
[FEMALE CHEVALIER 9B]
Unless a miracle happens,

342
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:35,083
your little rebellion's over.

343
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:37,958
[AMELIA] In that case.
I'll make one!

344
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:41,208
[AMELIA yells]

345
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:42,875
[FEMALE OPERATOR 10A]
Amelia Evans' Nova Form

346
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:44,750
is accelerating!

347
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:47,416
Again?

348
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,625
[CHIFFON gasps]

349
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:00,833
I've been expecting you.

350
00:22:05,375 --> 00:22:10,666
Oh no. What... is this?

351
00:23:41,291 --> 00:23:42,708
[OHARA]
This doesn't make sense!

352
00:23:42,791 --> 00:23:45,291
I created you for the sole
purpose of surpassing Gengo Aoi.

353
00:23:45,375 --> 00:23:48,083
[GENGO] Simple. I'm the head of
Chevalier's inspection team.

354
00:23:48,166 --> 00:23:50,666
[SATELLIZER]
Next time: "Nova Crash."
