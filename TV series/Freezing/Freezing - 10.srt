1
00:00:17,166 --> 00:00:18,708
Speed of targets
remains unchanged.

2
00:00:18,791 --> 00:00:20,916
They are still en
route to East Genetics.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,791
It's bad enough
there are multiple Nova.

4
00:00:22,875 --> 00:00:25,875
But this new beam
attack is wiping us out.

5
00:00:25,958 --> 00:00:27,291
And I don't even
know if a med team

6
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:29,708
can help the Pandora that
get absorbed into them...

7
00:00:29,791 --> 00:00:30,833
I've never seen them target

8
00:00:30,916 --> 00:00:33,041
a specific location
like this, either.

9
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:34,250
If this is the new precedent,

10
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:36,541
then things sure aren't
looking good for us.

11
00:00:36,625 --> 00:00:39,125
On the upside, our
support team should be

12
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:41,250
reaching East Genetics
any minute now...

13
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:44,125
Preparations are being made to
intercept the Nova as we speak.

14
00:00:44,208 --> 00:00:46,125
Although their ability
to absorb the Pandora

15
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:47,458
doesn't look promising,

16
00:00:47,541 --> 00:00:49,916
I'm sure West has obtained
some data on it by now.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,666
We won't suffer the same
kind of defeat a second time.

18
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,666
God help us all if you're wrong.

19
00:00:57,916 --> 00:00:59,250
Targets lost...!

20
00:00:59,916 --> 00:01:02,458
Readings have disappeared
from all tracking systems!

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,541
Now what's going on?

22
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,166
It's because she has
six Sacreds on her back...

23
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,708
The exact same
Stigmata my sister had!

24
00:01:28,791 --> 00:01:31,000
So hold... you don't want
to become her Limiter

25
00:01:31,083 --> 00:01:33,458
because you two are friends
or anything like that?

26
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:35,750
It's just because
she's like your sister?

27
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:05,083
How could this be happening?!

28
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:06,625
I wish I could tell you...

29
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:09,416
They only disappeared
10 minutes ago and now this?!

30
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:22,833
They're knocking
on our front door

31
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:25,125
before we can ready the troops!

32
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:25,958
Did they plan this?

33
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:28,291
They have us surrounded!

34
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:29,541
Order the fourth-years
on standby

35
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:31,041
at East to come back now!

36
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:32,208
Yes ma'am!

37
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:33,333
No good...

38
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:34,750
They aren't going
to make it in time.

39
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:37,750
The attack on East Genetics
was a distraction.

40
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:19,833
All previous Nova that appeared
seemed to have no destination...

41
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:22,708
but moved about as if they
were searching for something.

42
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:24,125
The longest observed time

43
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:27,833
that they have spent on
Earth is 5 hours and 37 minutes.

44
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:29,791
Were they to remain
here any longer...

45
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:33,041
Dimensional compression
would cause them to explode.

46
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:37,666
The marks they leave
may be to indicate

47
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:40,666
that they have already
searched a particular area.

48
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,416
So you're saying that East
wasn't their real target at all.

49
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,208
It was us the whole time?

50
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:48,958
The Nova may finally have
found what they've been seeking.

51
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:52,041
In that case... please give us
permission to move out, ma'am.

52
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:55,000
We'll do whatever it takes.

53
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:09,875
Miss President...!

54
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:12,625
Abel and Yujin are heading
for the auditorium right now.

55
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:15,000
In that case, we'd
better not waste any time.

56
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:16,208
Right.

57
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:22,375
Level 1 Alert! Level 1 Alert!

58
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:24,083
This is message for all Pandora

59
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:26,500
and Limiters
currently on campus!

60
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:28,541
Pandora, equip Volt Textures

61
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:30,875
and prepare
Volt weapons immediately.

62
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:32,708
Limiters, change
into battle uniforms

63
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,625
and assemble
in the auditorium...

64
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:36,958
Four Nova have appeared.

65
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:38,416
We believe they
are the same ones

66
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,291
that attacked East earlier
and absorbed their Pandora.

67
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:42,625
The fourth years we sent

68
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:44,958
to help them have
not made it back yet...

69
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:47,625
Therefore, our only choice
is to assemble new platoons

70
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:50,375
with the remaining
one-third of our fourth-years.

71
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:54,291
The third-years will provide
defense at each of our gates.

72
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:55,791
For most of you,

73
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:58,000
I'm sure this will be your
first time in an actual fight...

74
00:05:58,083 --> 00:05:59,250
But if you show
the same strength

75
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:01,333
that you've shown
every day at this school,

76
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:04,208
I have confidence that
you can defeat the Nova.

77
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:07,958
Second-years and Limiters will
stand by until further notice.

78
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:09,625
That is all.

79
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:20,666
Uh, excuse me, Miss Satella?

80
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:29,000
It's because she has
six Sacreds on her back...

81
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:33,000
The exact same
Stigmata my sister had!

82
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:41,458
Let's head to the
waiting room, okay?

83
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:44,125
No way... I'd rather
fight than sit here and wait.

84
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:46,625
But second years are
supposed to stay on standby.

85
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:48,625
Don't make me repeat myself.

86
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:50,416
Fine, then I'll come, too.

87
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,083
I don't need you.

88
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:58,041
Satella, hold on...
Why are you so mad?

89
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:00,208
If that is how you feel...

90
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:03,166
I will be glad to be his
partner in your place.

91
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,166
That is okay, right?

92
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,750
I'm... confused.

93
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,708
So I assume you
accept your defeat...

94
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:12,333
Is that right?

95
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:13,541
What?

96
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:15,541
I am sorry, did you not hear me?

97
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:18,500
Very well...
allow me to say it again.

98
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:20,750
I assume that you
accept your defeat...

99
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:21,375
Do you?

100
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:22,833
Not a chance...

101
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:27,083
I won't lose to you,
or anyone else.

102
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:29,250
Well, then that is too bad.

103
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:56,541
Stop it, both of you!

104
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:00,958
We don't have time to
be fighting among ourselves

105
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:02,291
when we're under attack...!

106
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:03,416
You didn't become Pandora

107
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,291
to fight over some
little disagreement!

108
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:08,541
The reason you're here's
much more important than that!

109
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:17,708
It's not just Stigmata
that I carry on my back...

110
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:20,958
I carry all of your
hopes and dreams as well.

111
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:24,375
We Pandora carry the hopes
and dreams of the whole world...

112
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:27,958
because we're the only ones
who can defeat the Nova.

113
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:31,208
And all of those hopes...
give me strength...

114
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:34,250
That's why
I promise I won't lose.

115
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:36,166
My sister said that too.

116
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,541
She said she wouldn't lose.

117
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:44,375
Because when Pandora
battle the Nova,

118
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:45,833
they're carrying the
hopes of everyone

119
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:48,416
in the world on their backs!

120
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:56,666
You are right, there are more
important things for us to do.

121
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:01,125
All targets have
passed the defensive line

122
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:03,250
and are continuing
their advance...

123
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:04,916
The reformed
Platoons 1 through 4

124
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,583
are currently en route
to engage all four Nova.

125
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:18,583
Captain Schmitz and Platoon 1
are heading to the East Gate.

126
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:21,041
They will engage
Target 1 shortly.

127
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:29,791
The target is now
400 meters to our North...

128
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:32,583
We will intercept the Nova
in exactly three minutes...

129
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:34,750
All Pandora move
to the mission area...

130
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:36,500
Limiters move into position

131
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:39,041
with their vehicles and
secure our defensive line.

132
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:43,083
Let's move out, Platoon 1!

133
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:03,041
I knew it would come
to this someday...

134
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:06,791
Might as well be now.

135
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,291
What the hell?

136
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,458
Have the camera zoom in
on Target 1 immediately!

137
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:29,083
Yes ma'am.

138
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:34,333
No...

139
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,041
Those are the Pandora
that the Nova absorbed...

140
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:09,541
Are those... Stigmata?!

141
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:12,041
Nova Form. It's as I feared.

142
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:40,833
They're so fast.
Must be double acceleration!

143
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:42,375
Destroy every
last one of them...!

144
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:44,125
We cannot let them
reach the campus!

145
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:46,458
Yes ma'am!

146
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:48,958
But what about Target 1?

147
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:51,958
I'll take care of it myself!

148
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:10,625
Are you sure...?!

149
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:11,875
Elise is fighting
that thing alone?!

150
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:13,291
Yes ma'am...

151
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:14,500
Please provide backup

152
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:17,000
to her platoon once
Target 3 is destroyed.

153
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:19,000
Easier said than done!

154
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:23,500
Strikers broke
through, way to go...!

155
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:25,958
Watch and learn, girls--I'll
take it from here!

156
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:33,375
Volt Weapon: deploy...! Getsuro!

157
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:36,333
Don't die on me, Elise!

158
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:39,166
Sakurako Shekoin and Irene
Vanette have been injured

159
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,291
while battling
the enemy Pandora.

160
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:43,000
Send a medic out
to them, immediately.

161
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:44,208
Yes, ma'am...!

162
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:46,291
Sending a message to
the standby medic team.

163
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:49,416
The enemy Pandora are
approaching the East Gate.

164
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:53,791
I wonder if our fourth-years
are all right out there...

165
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:55,375
I know, it's scary, huh...?

166
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:57,208
And since some of our
troops still aren't back yet,

167
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:59,916
the new platoons they
made are shorthanded.

168
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,166
It's no big deal,

169
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,666
even if the fourth years
can't beat the Nova...

170
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,583
We can protect the
school ourselves,

171
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:06,291
as along as we
hold the East Gate.

172
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:08,583
Although it is rather
irksome that they'd assign

173
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:09,750
the great Miyabi Kannazuki

174
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:12,916
to lowly guard duty
in a time like this.

175
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,458
Who is she talking to?

176
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:15,791
Why doesn't she go play

177
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:17,875
with her boy toys and
let us take care of this?

178
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:19,750
I'm sorry, did you
say something?

179
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:21,500
No ma'am...!

180
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:28,958
What happened to the gate?!

181
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,166
Who the hell are you?!

182
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,208
The East Gate has been breached!

183
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:42,916
Of course...
That gate is the closest.

184
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,416
I know exactly
what they're after...

185
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,166
Withdraw all third-years
from their current positions

186
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:50,041
and send them to back up
the Pandora at the East Gate.

187
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:51,625
Yes ma'am!

188
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:55,041
Level 3 Alert! Level 3 Alert.

189
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,041
Intruders have
breached the East Gate.

190
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:59,000
All troops, leave your post
and head there at once...!

191
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:00,625
What the hell is
going on now...?

192
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:03,250
Are they saying the Nova
have broken into the school?

193
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:06,166
Shh...! Shut up
and listen, Yujin!

194
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,958
The intruders are enemy Pandora.

195
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:10,416
They may be
difficult to discern.

196
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,833
Sounds bad.

197
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:13,541
Look for the large
Stigmata on their chests

198
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:15,625
to distinguish them from allies.

199
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:18,333
Despite their appearance,
these Pandora are the enemy

200
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:20,625
and must be
eliminated at all costs...

201
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:21,541
Repeat...

202
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:23,500
The intruders are enemy Pandora.

203
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:25,166
They may be
difficult to discern.

204
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,416
Despite their appearance,

205
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,583
these Pandora are the enemy...

206
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:28,791
I know you want to fight,

207
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:31,041
but we've been ordered
to stay on standby.

208
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,541
If you disobey orders,
they'll punish you!

209
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:40,291
When things get rough,
it is more important

210
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:43,083
to follow your heart
than the rules!

211
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:45,500
Not you too.

212
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,416
Ignore me, will you?!

213
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:02,375
I'll have to teach you
some manners...!

214
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:04,583
Homing Dagger!

215
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:23,458
Wait, come back...

216
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:29,291
Enemy Pandora have
passed the East Gate

217
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:31,958
and are continuing to the
Ravensborne Nucleochede.

218
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:33,208
I thought so...

219
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:35,291
Order all high-ranking
third years to abandon

220
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:38,166
their current posts and head to
the Ravensborne Nucleochede

221
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,625
as quickly as possible.

222
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:41,250
Yes ma'am!

223
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:43,416
One more thing...

224
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:49,500
Hold on a second...!

225
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:50,583
Let me go!

226
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:52,208
No... we need to talk.

227
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:53,375
Let go!!

228
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:55,708
Just hold on!

229
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:58,208
Hey... what's gotten into you?

230
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:02,458
I'm my own person, not just
some substitute for your sister.

231
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:07,125
They look upset...

232
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:10,250
Did something happen
between those two?

233
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,083
A substitute for my sister...?

234
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:14,958
Where did that come from...?

235
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:17,333
Why would you even say that?

236
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:19,541
I probably should've
told you myself,

237
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:23,000
but it's true that 6 of Kazuha's
Sacreds were implanted in me.

238
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:25,250
That's why I'm
"special" to you, isn't it...?

239
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:26,541
That's the real reason

240
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:29,541
why you wanted to be
my partner so badly!

241
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:36,708
I guess that means
you overheard us...

242
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:38,916
But I didn't mean
it that way at all.

243
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:42,416
Attention... Second-year
students Ganessa Roland,

244
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:46,625
Satellizer el Bridget, and
Rana Linchen, report for duty

245
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:49,458
at the the Ravensborne
Nucleochede immediately.

246
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:53,666
Wait... The Raven's
Butt Nuclear Frayed?!

247
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,083
What on Earth is that?

248
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:59,208
Satella, wait...!
Come on, let's go!

249
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:01,541
Okay, but I am still confused!

250
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:07,875
Are the Pandora in place?

251
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:10,125
They're in position
on each of their floors.

252
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:12,541
Then we shall proceed
according to plan.

253
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:13,750
Yes ma'am.

254
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:17,791
Would all of you
please come with me.

255
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:39,375
Enemy Pandora have
reached the entrance

256
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,375
to the Ravensborne Nucleochede.

257
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:47,416
Our highest-ranked third years

258
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,875
are assigned
to this area as well.

259
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:52,166
However, if they happen
to fail in their duty...

260
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:55,416
Protect this place
with your lives.

261
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,875
What's behind the door?

262
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,416
The Holy Remains.

263
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,250
Holy remains?

264
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:36,583
They know you are
the source of our power.

265
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:38,958
They are coming
for you as I speak...

266
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:41,125
I pray our students
can save you.

267
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:44,500
Wish them well...
Maria Lancelot.

268
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:48,250
So, what are these "Holy
Remains" she was talking about?

269
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:49,875
Do you know?

270
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:50,875
Me...?

271
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:52,375
Why would I know
about some corpse?

272
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:55,250
The body of the woman who
gave birth to all Pandora...

273
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:57,458
They say.

274
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:58,708
As you slept,

275
00:18:58,791 --> 00:19:00,750
the Stigmata inside you
were mass manufactured

276
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:03,916
and implanted into young
women all over the world...

277
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,416
...to create our only hope
against the Nova's attacks.

278
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,458
Thus were the Pandora born...

279
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:12,083
And yet, the Stigmata that give
them their strength are made

280
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:15,083
of the same material
as a Nova's core.

281
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:17,250
In other words, giving
birth to the Pandora

282
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:21,083
meant planting the Nova's
framework upon humanity's back.

283
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:23,458
So all Pandora have the
possibility of reverting

284
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:26,291
to Nova Form and
turning on their allies.

285
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:30,583
In fact, in 2061, during
the Eighth Nova Clash...

286
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:33,791
It happened to
our hero, Kazuha Aoi.

287
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:45,666
Enemy Pandora have entered
the Ravensborne Nucleochede...!

288
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:46,916
They've burst
through the entrance

289
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,750
to the Central Elevator!

290
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:00,625
Sounds like the
party's starting.

291
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:11,916
All main barriers are closing!

292
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,583
Sector 22 now shut off.
Sector 31 now shut off!

293
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:20,958
Enemy Pandora
have cleared Barrier 51!

294
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:24,125
Barrier 53 now closing to
block off their advance...

295
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:25,666
After they've been
rerouted to Level 6

296
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:28,208
the plan will
proceed to Phase 2.

297
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:30,833
Enemy Pandora now
moving to Level 7.

298
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:35,208
Rerouting was successful.

299
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:38,666
Barriers 36 through 40
on Level 7 are all closed.

300
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:41,583
Enemy Pandora now
passing through Area C.

301
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:45,875
Area C now closed off.

302
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:51,708
The plan is moving to Phase 3.

303
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:55,041
Activating
Neutralization System!

304
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:10,416
Area C now filling
with non-lethal gas...

305
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,750
10 PPM... 20 PPM...

306
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:21,125
Neutralization level
has been reached!

307
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:23,666
High energy readings in Area C!

308
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:30,916
Area C hermetic barrier
has been destroyed.

309
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,916
Enemy Pandora are free.

310
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,125
The gas had no effect and
their beams tore through

311
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:37,666
our barriers like they
were made out of paper!

312
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,833
Those abnormal Stigmata
have to be the cause of this...

313
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:41,416
Even our highest-ranked Pandora

314
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,500
don't have that
level of strength.

315
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:44,666
No time to talk now...

316
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,875
The enemy Pandora are moving.

317
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,208
We limited the
number of Stigmata

318
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:52,333
implanted in each Pandora...

319
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:54,000
So that the
tragedy we faced

320
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:57,333
with Kazuha Aoi would
never be repeated.

321
00:21:57,416 --> 00:22:00,250
Yet, now... despite our efforts,

322
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:03,208
the Nova have turned our
own Pandora against us

323
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:05,458
and all may be lost.

324
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:07,416
Though mankind cannot
fight without them...

325
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,416
our Stigmata may be
a double-edged sword.

326
00:23:41,041 --> 00:23:43,458
We're still researching her
genetic mysteries ourselves,

327
00:23:43,541 --> 00:23:44,708
but handing them over

328
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:47,375
to the Nova would assure
the defeat of mankind...

329
00:23:47,458 --> 00:23:50,166
Next time: "Ambush!
Ravensborne Nucleochede."
