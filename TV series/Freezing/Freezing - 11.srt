1
00:00:45,166 --> 00:00:46,750
It's using that attack!

2
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,500
Sorry it took me so long.

3
00:01:02,583 --> 00:01:03,875
Yumi!

4
00:01:05,541 --> 00:01:07,875
Third Platoon, once you've
eliminated Target Three,

5
00:01:07,958 --> 00:01:11,000
coordinate with the units
engaged with Target One.

6
00:01:11,083 --> 00:01:12,291
What's our current status?

7
00:01:12,375 --> 00:01:13,958
Our forces have
exposed the cores

8
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:15,375
of Targets Three and Four...

9
00:01:15,458 --> 00:01:16,958
All platoons are continuing on

10
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:19,041
their assigned
intercept attacks.

11
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:22,041
Where do things stand with
the Ravensborne Nucleochede?

12
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:25,291
Scans show enemy Pandora
are moving toward level eight.

13
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:28,833
Barriers fifty-nine
and sixty are closed...

14
00:01:28,916 --> 00:01:30,375
The invading units
are being rerouted

15
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:32,291
to our primary defensive line...

16
00:01:32,375 --> 00:01:34,000
Stationed at that
position we have:

17
00:01:34,083 --> 00:01:41,041
Ingrid Bernstein,
Attia Simmons, Creo Brand,

18
00:01:41,125 --> 00:01:43,541
and Arnett McMillan...

19
00:01:44,125 --> 00:01:46,250
They're prepared to engage.

20
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:27,083
I have something
very important to say.

21
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:29,333
I'm sure you've heard
any number of rumors,

22
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:31,500
but the Ravensborne
Nucleochede contains

23
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:35,375
the body of the woman who
gave birth to all Pandora.

24
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:37,458
This is the place
where we've stored

25
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:40,416
her "holy remains"
in order to keep them safe.

26
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,791
At this time,
we don't know how the Nova

27
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:44,625
were able to locate
the holy remains

28
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:46,291
or why they're after them.

29
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:49,000
We're still researching her
genetic mysteries ourselves,

30
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:50,875
but handing her over to the Nova

31
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:53,416
would assure the
defeat of mankind...

32
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,458
Therefore, it's vital
that you protect them.

33
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:03,208
I'm counting on you all.

34
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:07,791
That confirms
everything you said.

35
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:11,958
I heard it at the
el Bridget Manor...

36
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:12,833
What?

37
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:14,166
Uh, nothing...

38
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,125
It's just that guarding
such an important artifact

39
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:17,666
is the perfect assignment for me

40
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,958
since I am the highest
ranked second-year.

41
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:21,750
So it seems including
the number-two student

42
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:24,791
and some backwater
hick is a bit superfluous.

43
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:27,458
Who are you calling
a backwater hick?!

44
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:31,250
But then, the
top ranked third-years

45
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:34,083
were assigned to
this location as well.

46
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:37,041
This is just another
"safety zone"...

47
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:39,791
We're no different then the
other second years on standby.

48
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:41,333
Those third-years
are protecting us

49
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:44,750
while we "stand guard" here
and that's all there is to it.

50
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:50,625
Okay, what's your problem now?

51
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:52,833
I was wondering what's
the problem with you...

52
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:55,458
I've never known you to be
so talkative before today.

53
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:58,916
I have to agree. It is
a bit unusual for you.

54
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,500
Is it possible
that this situation

55
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:03,125
has rattled that
legendary nerve of yours?

56
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:06,000
No... That's not it at all.

57
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:26,125
Now deploying
Volt Weapon! Divine Trust!

58
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:28,333
Morning Star!

59
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:31,333
Deploying Infinity Fang!

60
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:34,500
Scythe... Machina!

61
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:41,291
Direct confrontation isn't

62
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:43,375
my usual approach
for handling things.

63
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:45,333
That's so typical of you.

64
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,250
Our guests have arrived!

65
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:52,500
They're using acceleration...!

66
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:53,750
Morrison, now!

67
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:54,416
Leo!

68
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,958
All together, guys!

69
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:01,791
What's wrong?

70
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:03,833
Was that sudden stop
inconvenient for you?

71
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,583
We've detected a Freezing cast
at the primary defensive line...

72
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:12,125
Enemy Pandora have stopped.

73
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:23,541
Hold on... They can use the
same powers as the Nova, right?

74
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:26,333
So let's treat them like
Nova and tear them apart!

75
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:29,125
Attia...! Above you!

76
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:44,000
You won't get away from me!

77
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:45,583
You do not need to pursue.

78
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:49,416
Restraining your current targets
is to remain your top priority.

79
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,375
But... Sister Margaret, why?!

80
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:58,750
There are other Pandora
guarding the facility.

81
00:06:58,833 --> 00:06:59,791
Understood.

82
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:02,125
Restraining them
is our top priority?

83
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:06,291
Man, I really hate it when
somebody tells me to hold back.

84
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:08,708
Lead them to the
secondary defensive line!

85
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:10,375
Understood...!

86
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:14,916
Barriers seventy and
seventy-one are closing now.

87
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:23,708
Enemy Pandora have
reached level ten...

88
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:26,625
They're about to cross the
secondary defensive line.

89
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:34,375
So I missed, did I?

90
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:40,625
Enemy Pandora are at the
secondary defensive line!

91
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:42,916
You now face...
second-ranked third year...

92
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,166
Executor of Ingenious
Schemes, Elizabeth Mably...

93
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,458
Prepare to die.

94
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:49,833
Andrei, watch
the enemy closely...

95
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:51,916
...and be prepared if
either casts a Freezing.

96
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,583
Yes, my lady.

97
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:59,000
Freezing!

98
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:03,416
Stigma Satellite
System, activate!

99
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:16,583
It appears that if we destroy
the Stigmata in their chest

100
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:19,833
we can safely release the
Pandora from the Nova's control.

101
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,000
Understood!

102
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,750
Attention: The invading
Pandora's weakness

103
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:25,375
is the Stigmata in their chest.

104
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:27,583
Did you hear that?

105
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:29,000
Oh yeah.

106
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:31,083
Well, that sure
makes things simple!

107
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:32,541
Let me at 'em!

108
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:57,416
We did it.

109
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:00,041
Freezing area!

110
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:43,791
One enemy Pandora has
reached the lowest level.

111
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:57,250
I know you...!

112
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:59,333
You're the Godspeed of the East!

113
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:00,375
You know her too?

114
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:01,958
Well, yeah.

115
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:05,625
And I heard about the
history between you two.

116
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:14,750
That's in the past...

117
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:17,041
but I never imagined
we would meet again.

118
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,750
Hold on, country girl!

119
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:28,958
I'll free you from that
monster before you know it!

120
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:31,083
I never expected
to hear that from you!

121
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:33,625
However, I am not as
helpless as you think!

122
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:35,666
Four Mindsets!

123
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:47,250
You did it!

124
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:48,958
She had it coming.

125
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,291
Was that... an Acceleration?

126
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:11,875
That's strange. She Accelerates
differently than we do.

127
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:13,750
I may not be able to Accelerate,

128
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:16,125
but that doesn't mean
I can't slow her down!

129
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:23,458
Chains of Binding!

130
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:32,958
Rana!

131
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:34,500
You've got to get
out of here, now!

132
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:36,916
I'd never run away from a fight!

133
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:40,833
If you do not know
how to Accelerate,

134
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:43,916
you will just be a burden
we cannot afford to deal with!

135
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:09,833
Thank you... Kazuya.

136
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,916
Okay, that was terrifying.

137
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,250
Miss Ganessa, are you okay?

138
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,541
Are you okay, Miss Satella?

139
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:36,041
Get away from me, Aoi...!

140
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:37,708
I can handle this all by myself!

141
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:39,666
But why?

142
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:45,083
I'm my own person, not some
substitute for your sister.

143
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:48,833
Now get back.

144
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:51,750
Cathy and I have some
unfinished business.

145
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:01,541
I've been waiting to
finish this for a long time.

146
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:08,041
I won't let her
get the best of me!

147
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:18,625
Her speed's incredible!

148
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:46,583
You're not going anywhere...

149
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:49,000
I haven't finished with you yet.

150
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:53,708
Satellizer!

151
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:21,166
Did she just do
a Tempest Turn...?

152
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,666
No... It's an Acceleration.

153
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:38,291
That was incredible!

154
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:41,583
I distinctly remember telling
you to stay out of this.

155
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:49,583
What's happening? Where am I?

156
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:52,083
She just spoke...
She isn't dead?

157
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:58,166
What is this place...?
What am I doing here?

158
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:06,583
So that's it, the large
Stigmata in her chest

159
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:08,625
is what's been
controlling her mind!

160
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:21,958
If I don't take her down in
this next attack, I'm done for!

161
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:36,708
Her fusion with the Stigmata
framework is increasing...

162
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:38,416
At this rate, she'll...

163
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,125
Non-interval Double
Acceleration!

164
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:55,416
There it is...!

165
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,750
It's like a Tempest Turn
with Acceleration!

166
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,666
Triple... Acceleration!

167
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:21,458
Quadruple Acceleration?!

168
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:33,333
I can't keep up with her speed!

169
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,875
You have to stop, Cathy!

170
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:56,875
Snap out of it!

171
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:58,500
You know you don't
want to do this!

172
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:00,083
Kazuya...

173
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,125
Don't let this thing make you
forget who you really are...!

174
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:09,083
Remember what you said you
wanted to do with your life!

175
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:15,333
Besides, if you're
half as good at writing

176
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:16,916
as you are at fighting Nova,

177
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,125
it'd be a crime if I didn't
get to read your work!

178
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,708
Thank you!

179
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:48,625
Kazuya...! Get away from here!

180
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:50,083
No chance in hell...!

181
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:51,583
I am not leaving you!

182
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:54,458
I've already said you're not
needed for this fight!

183
00:17:54,541 --> 00:18:01,083
I don't care if you need me, I'm
staying right here because...

184
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:03,625
Because I need you, Satella!

185
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:09,958
Why...?

186
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:11,375
Why do you think?

187
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:14,000
It's because you're my partner!

188
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:15,666
Don't you understand, yet...?

189
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,750
You received
my sister's Stigmata.

190
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:19,958
You're incredibly
important to me...!

191
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:25,166
Because you showed
me that... with you...

192
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:28,250
It's not just Stigmata
that I carry on my back...

193
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:31,541
I carry all of your hopes
and dreams as well.

194
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:35,916
We Pandora carry the hopes
and dreams of the whole world.

195
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,833
With you I can protect the
world my sister fought to save!

196
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,541
I'm such a fool...

197
00:18:57,625 --> 00:18:59,875
What was I thinking...?

198
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:03,333
Kazuya never wanted me
to replace his sister...

199
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:06,583
As if I could be an adequate
substitute for Kazuha Aoi,

200
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:10,541
the heroine that all
Pandora aspire to.

201
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:15,458
All Kazuya ever
wanted was a partner...

202
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:19,333
Someone to help him protect
the hopes we all have.

203
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,375
When we first met,
he may have chosen me

204
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:28,375
because I inherited
his sister's Sacreds.

205
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:31,750
But the truth is, I'm the
one who discovered him...

206
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:34,750
If I didn't have
those Sacreds...

207
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:37,166
I wouldn't have a partner...

208
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,083
I'd still be alone.

209
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,333
I'm happy that I met Kazuya.

210
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:49,833
For this, I am grateful
to you, Kazuha Aoi,

211
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:53,791
but I swear...
I will never be defeated...

212
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:58,000
One day, I will surpass
even your legend.

213
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:06,250
When this battle is finished,

214
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:09,250
you will get your
Baptism, Kazuya.

215
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:18,000
Kazuya!

216
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:22,208
I can't move...!
I'm dead for sure!

217
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:29,625
I thought the Freezing
was neutralized,

218
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:32,000
why isn't she moving?

219
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:38,083
No...! Stop forcing me
to kill these people...

220
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:41,250
I don't want to hurt
anyone ever again...

221
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:43,125
There's only one
thing I've ever wanted,

222
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:46,458
to be a novelist...
I never wanted this.

223
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:55,583
What's happening to her?

224
00:20:57,625 --> 00:20:59,083
I need your help...!

225
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:02,916
I'm begging you, Satellizer,
do whatever it takes to stop me!

226
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:09,875
She's disappearing!

227
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:25,166
Elizabeth, what in the
hell happened to you?

228
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,083
I'm sorry, ladies...

229
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:45,000
I'm afraid I let you down.

230
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:01,583
One enemy Pandora detected.

231
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:03,666
She's reached the
Ravensborne Nucleochede

232
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,625
and the holy remains!

233
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:43,083
I never wanted
to make friends...

234
00:23:43,166 --> 00:23:44,500
For the longest time,

235
00:23:44,583 --> 00:23:47,166
the only person I cared about
at this academy was me.

236
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:50,083
Final episode:
"Satellizer vs. Pandora."
