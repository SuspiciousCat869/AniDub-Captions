1
00:00:17,458 --> 00:00:19,000
Freezing area!

2
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:23,833
Now deploying Volt weapon.

3
00:00:31,833 --> 00:00:35,125
Halcyon...! Double Acceleration!

4
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:38,708
Triple Acceleration!

5
00:00:43,041 --> 00:00:45,333
Quadruple Acceleration!

6
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:04,333
So that's her...
the Godspeed of the East...

7
00:01:04,416 --> 00:01:07,875
Yes... She is the top
ranked third-year student

8
00:01:07,958 --> 00:01:09,666
here at East Genetics.

9
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:13,166
Her name is Cathy Lockharte.

10
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:16,333
Satellizer!

11
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:18,583
Are you daydreaming
about your time

12
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:20,416
with Kazuya at the big dance?

13
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,750
What makes you think

14
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:24,208
I would spend all my time
fantasizing about him?!

15
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:25,750
I can take that
as a "yes," then?

16
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:27,541
I have more important
things to think about...

17
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:30,708
...and besides, Kazuya
isn't even here right now.

18
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:32,375
Wow, this is a real honor...!

19
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:35,250
Thank you so much for
inviting me to East Genetics!

20
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,250
No, thank you...

21
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:38,583
I'm sure you're busy,

22
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:40,250
so I'm grateful that you
took the time to visit us.

23
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:42,416
There's no need to
be so polite with me--

24
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,916
even if I'm a guest,
I'm still your junior!

25
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:47,458
I suppose so...

26
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:50,916
Miss Lockharte here is
one of the chosen Pandora...

27
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,458
After the Eighth Nova Clash,
the Stigmata of Kazuha Aoi

28
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:56,000
were deemed as "Sacreds"

29
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:59,250
and given to select
Pandora like Cathy.

30
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:03,875
So that means you have
my sister's Stigmata?

31
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:09,000
As soon as I heard that
Kazuha's younger brother

32
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:10,541
had enrolled at West Genetics,

33
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:13,000
I did everything I could to
arrange for you to come here...

34
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:15,791
I thought I should at
least pay my respects.

35
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:17,791
Thank you, thank
you so very much.

36
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:19,125
Don't thank me...!

37
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:21,875
I didn't have anything
to do with it...

38
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:26,541
So you're number one
in the whole school...

39
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:28,875
I suppose I don't
look like much, do I?

40
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:30,333
I didn't mean it that way...!

41
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:32,791
Your Quadruple Acceleration
was really something else!

42
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:35,083
I didn't even know Pandora
could move that fast...!

43
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:36,833
And you beat two Nova at once!

44
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:41,666
Even so, that would never
happen in an actual fight.

45
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,250
Surprised...?

46
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:45,750
In all our encounters... we've
only seen one Nova at a time.

47
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:48,250
Right... I almost forgot...

48
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:50,208
But it doesn't
matter... because...

49
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:53,791
...I plan on retiring
after this year, anyway.

50
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:57,875
I thought someone like you
would join Chevalier for sure...

51
00:04:57,958 --> 00:04:59,958
That's what all the good
Pandora do their fourth year

52
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:02,916
so they can work with the
anti-Nova reserve forces, right?

53
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,583
I may seem strong but, I don't
think I'm suited to that life...

54
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:09,458
I'd like to pass my Sacreds
on to someone more deserving.

55
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:11,416
Why would you say that?

56
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,583
There's... something else
I want to do with myself.

57
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:16,125
Something else?

58
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:20,750
I actually want
to be a novelist.

59
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:22,958
I'm sorry, what did you say?

60
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:25,375
I just said I want
to be a novelist.

61
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:26,666
Say again?

62
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,500
I want to be a novelist, okay?!

63
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,333
I hope you don't think
that's disrespectful,

64
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:37,375
I know that as a Pandora
it's incredibly important

65
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:39,666
for me to fight
against the Nova...

66
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,166
But even so...

67
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:47,000
Since I was little... I've
always wanted to be a writer.

68
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:50,166
That must sound
pretty strange...

69
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:53,125
I wouldn't blame
you if you laughed...

70
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:55,291
Actually, I think
that's wonderful.

71
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:58,333
Besides, if you're
half as good at writing

72
00:05:58,416 --> 00:05:59,708
as you are at fighting Nova,

73
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:02,666
it'd be a crime if I didn't
get to read your work!

74
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:08,041
Thank you!

75
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,250
Are you sure about this...?

76
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:18,208
I can't change your mind, can I?

77
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:23,208
No... I'm sorry, Miss Milena...

78
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:25,291
I'm afraid not.

79
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:28,916
Who'da guessed...?

80
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,875
She wants to be a novelist...

81
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:33,333
It's a real shame.

82
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:35,208
She has a special
sort of talent,

83
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:38,708
the same kind that I saw in
your sister, to be honest.

84
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:42,208
I'm not certain
how much she told you

85
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:43,833
about her time as a Pandora,

86
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:46,791
but she was truly
a hero among heroes.

87
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:48,625
With 20 Stigmata in her body,

88
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:49,833
she was able to make

89
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:53,208
even the most abstract
of skills a reality.

90
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:55,833
After your sister's fatal
encounter with the Nova,

91
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,500
a number of her Sacreds were
passed on to Miss Lockharte,

92
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:03,125
who was found to have a very
rare 90% compatibility rate.

93
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:05,250
In all the Genetics
branches in the world,

94
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:06,708
not one other Pandora

95
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:09,583
has shown the same
degree of compatibility...

96
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:12,666
That is why I say it's a shame.

97
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:15,166
Please forgive my
disappointment...

98
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,541
We thought you would be the hero

99
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:19,333
that would lead the Pandora
in their next battle...

100
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:21,250
You could have
led the Chevalier.

101
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:23,666
I'm not worthy of such praise.

102
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,916
My father is a
politician, you know.

103
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,291
He's the only reason I entered
this school in the first place.

104
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:32,833
Of course I couldn't
let him down

105
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:34,958
by dropping out
before I graduated,

106
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:37,666
so I've given it my best
these past three years.

107
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:42,041
But that's all...
I don't want to go on.

108
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:44,500
I know my responsibility...

109
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:46,250
I'm still a Pandora...

110
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:48,541
and I'm not against
fighting the Nova...

111
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:50,083
Even after I graduate,

112
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:53,708
I'll do everything I can to
protect my friends and family.

113
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:56,375
But continuing
on to Chevalier...

114
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:59,416
being praised as a
hero and a leader...

115
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,125
that's more frightening
to me than anything.

116
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,375
It's frightening?

117
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:08,625
I may seem strong...

118
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:10,000
...but I don't have
the same strength

119
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:12,041
that a true Pandora has.

120
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:16,458
An unyielding will to face
any threat without fear...

121
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:18,916
...and a heart
as resolute as steel

122
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,458
with absolute faith in herself
and her mission alike...

123
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:25,208
I believe that these are
a Pandora's true strengths.

124
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:26,916
You're saying you
aren't like that?

125
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,375
No. I'm not.

126
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:30,208
I'm not a true Pandora.

127
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:32,458
I learned that lesson myself...

128
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:34,041
Or rather, someone who used

129
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:36,250
to go to school
here taught it to me.

130
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:37,583
Who was it?

131
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:39,708
You must remember the
fight I got into with her,

132
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:41,833
so I'm surprised
you even have to ask.

133
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:46,125
A year ago, when Brooks Leevon
was permanently injured...

134
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:48,125
...is that what you mean?

135
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:49,875
Yes.

136
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:53,458
Are you insane--
What are you doing?!

137
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:56,500
Satellizer el Bridget.

138
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:00,791
A true Pandora...

139
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:01,958
That day...

140
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,791
I learned the real
meaning of strength...

141
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:08,875
...and I learned who
I really was... a coward.

142
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:11,000
So that's why...

143
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:13,166
These Sacreds...

144
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,333
If Kazuha had 20 of them,
does that mean anyone

145
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:18,250
besides Cathy received
them after she died?

146
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:26,125
But Cathy, you have
six Sacreds, just like she does!

147
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:28,125
She's the same as you!

148
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:31,041
Satellizer has them, too?!

149
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:36,833
Yes... although an exam taken
before she transferred showed

150
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:40,583
that her compatibility
rate was under 5%.

151
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:43,000
Maybe that's why I mistook her

152
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,541
for my sister when
I first came to the school...

153
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:48,166
She has Kazuha's Stigmata...

154
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:50,541
Aoi...

155
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:52,125
Uh... yes?

156
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:53,666
I have heard...

157
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:56,750
...that you were intending to
become Satellizer's Limiter?

158
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:58,041
Yes ma'am, I was...!

159
00:09:58,125 --> 00:09:59,625
I mean, I am.

160
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:02,208
I haven't received the baptism
yet, but I'm still her partner.

161
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:04,041
Is that a fact...?

162
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:06,500
To be honest, after the
incident at East Genetics,

163
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:07,875
I did worry about her,

164
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:10,666
but I think you two
will be a good pair.

165
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,083
What really
happened back then...?

166
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:13,666
All I heard is that
some student wanted

167
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:16,000
to be her Limiter and
she hurt him really bad.

168
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,958
But there's more
to the story, right?

169
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:19,250
Yes...

170
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:21,291
Although she did
indeed injure the boy,

171
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:23,541
he later admitted that
she only became violent

172
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:26,916
after he tried to force
her to partner with him.

173
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:31,083
Oh... so that's it...

174
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,750
Actually he was quite fortunate

175
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:35,250
that Cathy Lockharte
was there to help him...

176
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:36,708
If she hadn't shown
up when she did,

177
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:39,041
he might have
been hurt even more.

178
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:40,750
I didn't know she
was part of this, too...

179
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:43,541
Satellizer's family is in
charge of the El Corporation...

180
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:45,000
Some people say
they're the reason

181
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:46,958
she got the Sacreds
in the first place...

182
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:49,041
...but I don't see
why you'd fear her.

183
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:56,791
Right from the start,

184
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:58,791
the difference in our
power was clear...

185
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:00,666
She didn't stand a chance.

186
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:14,375
And yet, even when it seemed
like the fight was over,

187
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:16,750
she didn't show a
single sign of giving up.

188
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:19,125
Just the opposite, in fact...

189
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:22,000
She came at me again and again,

190
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:25,083
regardless of how many
times I struck her down.

191
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:27,333
This was someone who
refused to be defeated,

192
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:30,375
no matter how much the odds
were stacked against her.

193
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:33,583
Our reason for fighting and
what we carried in our hearts...

194
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:35,791
...was clearly different.

195
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:38,416
When I saw what a true
Pandora was made of,

196
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,541
I realized how
weak I really was.

197
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:44,791
It was insane...

198
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:46,708
I kept fighting until
another third-year showed up

199
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:49,083
and we were finally
able to stop her.

200
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,208
I may've "won"...

201
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:53,208
But I lost all my
nerve in that fight.

202
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:55,875
Even if I do have these Sacreds,

203
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:59,416
I know someone like me isn't
fit to lead other Pandora!

204
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:02,083
I had no idea.

205
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:20,500
Under East Genetic's
jurisdiction?

206
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:21,791
Correct...

207
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,333
The dimensional interference
that we picked up

208
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:26,166
recently ended up
being the Nova after all.

209
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:34,416
Level 1 Alert! Level 1 Alert...!

210
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,875
This is message for all Pandora

211
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:38,541
and Limiters
currently on campus!

212
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:40,500
Pandora, equip Volt Textures

213
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:42,541
and prepare Volt
weapons immediately.

214
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:44,625
Limiters, change
into battle uniforms

215
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:45,958
and assemble in the
auditorium...

216
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:48,291
Volt Texture: Equip

217
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:49,625
This is message for all Pandora

218
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:52,083
and Limiters
currently on campus!

219
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:53,875
Pandora, equip Volt Textures

220
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:56,083
and prepare Volt
weapons immediately.

221
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:57,875
Limiters, change
into battle uniforms

222
00:12:57,958 --> 00:13:00,416
and assemble in
the auditorium...

223
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:04,750
This is live footage.

224
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,041
I've never seen
anything like this...

225
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:17,833
As I'm sure you're aware,

226
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:20,083
we are under attack
from Type S Nova.

227
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:21,875
There are four of them.

228
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:24,916
Four Nova?

229
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,125
Target 1 has breached
the defensive line.

230
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:29,708
Civilian evacuation is
proceeding on time...

231
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:32,250
Currently at 95% complete.

232
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:35,541
We will intercept the targets in
one minute and thirty seconds.

233
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:57,958
All units were destroyed.

234
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:00,541
Should have known...

235
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:02,250
Can't even slow them down.

236
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:05,125
Those poor soldiers
never stood a chance.

237
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:12,416
Milena...

238
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:15,958
Understood.

239
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,125
We have received our orders.

240
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:21,583
General Headquarters
has stated that all students

241
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:25,708
must move out to serve as
backup Limiters and Pandora.

242
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:34,625
Kazuya!

243
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:36,458
Did you hear?

244
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:37,416
Yeah.

245
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,375
Four S-Class Nova at once...?!

246
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:40,625
This is totally nuts!

247
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:42,541
You don't think
they'll come here, do you?

248
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:44,541
I'd like to see 'em try!

249
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:46,833
Give us a chance,

250
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:48,791
and I bet Gannessa and I can
take out a Nova or two...!

251
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:50,541
They won't know what
hit 'em when we show up!

252
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:51,875
Now hold on a sec...

253
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:54,208
Even if she's strong,
Ganessa's a second year...

254
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:55,708
I know this is bad,

255
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:57,750
but there's no way they'd
send underclassmen out there.

256
00:14:57,833 --> 00:14:59,291
But we don't know that...!

257
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:01,958
I heard that East doesn't have
enough Pandora to keep up...

258
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:03,791
Even second and third
years who aren't assigned

259
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:06,500
to Chevalier were ordered
to help with the fight.

260
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:09,083
Even the ones who aren't
moving onto their 4th year?

261
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:12,166
Well, it's an emergency,
what else can they do?

262
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:15,750
Then that means...
Cathy has to fight, too...

263
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:20,541
We will reach the mission
area in 15 minutes...

264
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:23,041
All personnel,
prepare for descent.

265
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:35,458
Chevalier Platoons 3, 7,
and 8 have completed deployment

266
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:36,916
and are nearing the target.

267
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,041
Full-force assault
will begin in 180 seconds.

268
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:45,916
Target 1 is
continuing its advance.

269
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,791
Decoys are now in place.

270
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,916
Strikers are now in place.

271
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:10,416
Alright, looks like the
Finishers are in place as well.

272
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:14,166
Operation commencing
in 10 seconds...

273
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:20,041
Five... Four...
Three... Two... One...

274
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:22,375
All right, decoys, spread out!

275
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:26,250
Keep it busy so the Strikers
can launch their attack!

276
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:37,458
Freezing!

277
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:40,416
Strikers! This is your chance!
It's time to move in!

278
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,958
Expose the core!

279
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:47,541
Finishers, get to that
core and destroy it!

280
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:49,750
Quadruple acceleration!

281
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:54,833
We're counting on you,
Cathy Lockharte!

282
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:57,625
She's almost there!

283
00:16:57,708 --> 00:16:59,208
Time to finish this!

284
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:05,000
Cathy, are you okay?

285
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:13,000
Did it time its attack
to intercept me...?

286
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:16,000
It knew my quadruple
acceleration was coming!

287
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:18,583
Filthy monster...

288
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:22,125
Decoys, time for round two...!

289
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,291
Distract the Nova one more time!

290
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:28,041
We're picking up high
energy readings from Target 1!

291
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:29,791
It can't be...

292
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:42,541
Since when can Nova
fire beams like that?

293
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:45,416
This isn't anything
like their last attack.

294
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:47,333
It was foolish of us

295
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:49,041
to think we'd seen the
limit of their strength,

296
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:51,875
and this is the price we
must pay for our ignorance.

297
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:53,791
Incoming message from GHQ...

298
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:56,000
West has been
ordered to mobilize.

299
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:00,833
So it's true.

300
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:03,250
The personnel at East
isn't enough to stop them...

301
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:05,791
That's why they're making
our fourth-years move out?

302
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:07,333
Well, there's four
Nova this time...

303
00:18:07,416 --> 00:18:08,875
That's never happened before.

304
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:10,958
I know I probably sound
like a coward saying this,

305
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:13,333
but I sure am glad
I'm a third-year right now.

306
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:15,416
Yeah, it's scary.

307
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:19,875
I do not understand this...

308
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:22,291
Why does everyone look
so scared and anxious...?

309
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:24,666
They are all speaking
in whispered tones!

310
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:29,291
At least tell me what
you are so angry about!

311
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:31,791
She's just frustrated.

312
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:34,958
Misses Student council
president and Vice President!

313
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:37,041
Frustrated at her
inability to do anything

314
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:38,541
in this time of emergency.

315
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:41,708
Emergency...? Please explain.

316
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:42,708
I'm sorry, wait...

317
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:44,041
Do you mean to tell me

318
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:45,666
that you have no idea
what's going on right now?

319
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,083
I haven't a clue.

320
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:53,708
So... what are you gonna do
if they order us to move out?

321
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:54,708
What do you mean?

322
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:56,958
Like, what about Satellizer...?

323
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:59,833
Would the two of you pair up
and fight with everyone else?

324
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:04,291
I mean... you haven't received
your baptism yet, right?

325
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:05,750
Oh, I forgot...

326
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:07,333
You don't need an Ereinbar
set like the other Limiters,

327
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:09,833
so you could team up with just
about anyone you wanted,

328
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:11,166
couldn't you?

329
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,208
It doesn't matter.

330
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:19,333
Satella is the
only partner I need.

331
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:21,333
So of course
I would fight with her.

332
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:23,125
She's really special to me.

333
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:24,833
Special, huh?

334
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:27,875
But... what do you mean?

335
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:30,833
I realized it the first day
I transferred here...

336
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:35,833
When I saw Satella...
she looked just like my sister.

337
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:41,791
Like the hero of the
eighth Nova clash...?

338
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:43,958
Kazuha Aoi, right?

339
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:46,166
Is that why you hugged
her when you first met?

340
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:53,875
But now I finally understand.

341
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:56,791
It's because she has
six Sacreds on her back...

342
00:19:56,875 --> 00:20:00,125
The exact same
Stigmata my sister had!

343
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:02,166
So hold on... you don't
want to become her Limiter

344
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:04,583
because you two are friends
or anything like that?

345
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:07,250
It's just because
she's like your sister?

346
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:10,583
I don't know.

347
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:12,541
Maybe subconsciously...

348
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:27,291
My eyes...! I can't see!

349
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:29,541
Somebody help me!

350
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:32,416
Get the medics out here!

351
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,291
What do you mean how many?

352
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:34,791
All of them!

353
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:45,458
Target 1 is performing
another unknown attack.

354
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:48,500
What's going on?!

355
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,583
They appear... to be fusing!

356
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:54,125
It's penetrating at
the point of contact

357
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:56,333
and combining with
her Stigmata framework!

358
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:58,583
Her Volt Texture
is being neutralized!

359
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:02,333
Cathy... hold on!

360
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:08,166
I have to get away... Now!

361
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:11,916
Is that you, Miss?

362
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:21,708
Quadruple Acceleration!

363
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,166
It's no use...

364
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,291
What's happening to me...

365
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:31,666
It's taking control of my body!

366
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:38,958
No!! Cathy!

367
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,750
It's because she has
six Sacreds on her back...

368
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:51,541
The exact same
Stigmata my sister had!

369
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:53,666
So hold on... you don't
want to become her Limiter

370
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:56,541
because you two are
friends or anything like that?

371
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:59,500
It's just because
she's like your sister?

372
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:43,041
Giving birth to the
Pandora meant planting

373
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:45,458
the Nova's framework
upon humanity's back.

374
00:23:45,541 --> 00:23:46,708
I'm not just some
substitute for your sister!

375
00:23:46,791 --> 00:23:48,208
Those are the Pandora
that the Nova absorbed.

376
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:49,666
Next time: "NOVA Form."
