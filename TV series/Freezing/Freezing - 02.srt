1
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,041
Satellizer el Bridget is
caught in a Freezing area.

2
00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:20,125
Origin unknown.

3
00:00:20,208 --> 00:00:21,666
Freezing Area
stabilization at 60...

4
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,791
Does that mean her opponent's
Limiter is fighting as well?

5
00:00:23,875 --> 00:00:24,916
The freezing radius
is expanding.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,291
10 meters and growing...

7
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:27,958
That wouldn't be wise...

8
00:00:28,041 --> 00:00:30,500
The Carnival was designed
to be a battle among equals...

9
00:00:30,583 --> 00:00:33,375
Using a Limiter to win
would be against the rules.

10
00:00:33,458 --> 00:00:34,625
I've confirmed that
the freezing area

11
00:00:34,708 --> 00:00:37,166
was cast from Satellizer
el Bridget's location.

12
00:00:38,666 --> 00:00:40,083
There's the culprit...

13
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:41,625
But why did he
interrupt the fight?

14
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,833
Must be a Limiter
protecting his partner.

15
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:44,833
Negative, sir...

16
00:00:44,916 --> 00:00:47,000
He's not a student
of this academy.

17
00:00:47,083 --> 00:00:50,958
But... he has the uniform...

18
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:56,041
Ah, I see... so it is you.

19
00:00:56,125 --> 00:00:58,333
Kazuya Aoi.

20
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:38,500
The Untouchable Queen
has met her first defeat!

21
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:40,541
Sattelizer el Bridget
faced a stinging loss

22
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:44,291
in the final moments of
this year's Carnival battle.

23
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:45,916
Details on the fight
are still scarce,

24
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,833
but it seems to have
been quite the upset.

25
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:49,916
I heard some guy ran up

26
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,291
and grabbed her
during the battle...!

27
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:53,500
Whoever it was, he musta
been out of his mind!

28
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:55,291
Either that, or he
had a death wish...

29
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:58,083
I just wonder who it could be...

30
00:02:58,166 --> 00:02:59,458
Uh, Arthur?

31
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:01,958
The new second-year
champion is with us right now.

32
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:06,458
Let's get a word from the Angel
of Binding, Ganessa Roland!

33
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,500
Sorry Hiiragi but I gotta go!

34
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:14,291
Well... I guess
I can't blame him.

35
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:16,791
But that mysterious Limiter
is really bugging me...

36
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:18,791
I mean, who would have
the nerve to get in the way

37
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:21,750
of the Untouchable Queen
during a fight?

38
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:23,791
I have to admit, I didn't
think you were the type

39
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:26,583
to cause such a ruckus on
your first day of school.

40
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:28,250
You're quite the rebel.

41
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:31,125
By the way, in case
you wanted to put a name

42
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:33,583
to that pair of breasts
you were fondling earlier...

43
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:37,666
She's a second year student
named Satellizer el Bridget.

44
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,166
When I saw her from behind...

45
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:49,916
She really did
look like my sister...

46
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,708
But that's stupid.

47
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:54,083
I know she's not coming back.

48
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:58,333
One-two! One-two! One-two!
One-two! One-two! One-two!

49
00:03:58,416 --> 00:03:59,708
Prior to that little accident,

50
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:03,041
she was the top-ranked
student in her grade.

51
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:04,166
Although we call it a "Carnival"

52
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,541
it's actually an official battle

53
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:08,083
to determine the ranking
of all our Pandora.

54
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:09,791
What happened was
certainly unfortunate,

55
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:12,541
but that doesn't effect the
outcome in the judges' eyes...

56
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:13,875
In other words,

57
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:16,833
regardless of the
circumstances, a loss is a loss.

58
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:19,250
I'd be careful if I were you...

59
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:21,791
I have a feeling she'll
hold a grudge for this.

60
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:23,958
Actually, I wanted
to talk about that.

61
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:25,041
Talk about what?

62
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:29,000
I know she's mad...
I can tell...

63
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:31,041
That's why I need you to
tell me where to find her,

64
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:33,583
so I can set things straight.

65
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:35,250
Whether I did it
on purpose or not,

66
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:37,708
it looks like I've caused
her a lot of trouble

67
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:39,916
and I need to apologize to her.

68
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:44,833
That is absolutely the
last thing you should do...!

69
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:46,500
Please, just trust
me on this one!

70
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:48,208
Making her lose was bad enough,

71
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:49,916
but that's just the
tip of the iceberg!

72
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,666
The way you touched her
was completely inappropriate!

73
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:53,916
You squeezed between her legs

74
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,708
and you buried your head
between her breasts...

75
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:58,666
I've never seen
anything so scandalous!

76
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,666
It's not like that...
Really, I--

77
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,583
Kazuya!

78
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:03,500
As student council president,

79
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:04,875
it's my sworn
duty to protect you.

80
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:06,250
It is?

81
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:08,375
So take my advice and
transfer schools right away.

82
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:09,625
Transfer...?

83
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:11,791
You do realize I just
transferred here, right?

84
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:14,541
This is a matter of
life and death, Aoi.

85
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:20,291
I know it's is hard
for you to understand...

86
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:23,958
So here... let me say something
to put all this in perspective.

87
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:27,666
Here at West Genetics...

88
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,166
...everybody calls her
the "Untouchable Queen."

89
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,708
Untouchable Queen?

90
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:37,958
I don't get it...
Why would they call her that?

91
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:46,333
Because she hates to be touched,
under any circumstance...

92
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:49,583
I'm afraid you've broken
an unbreakable law.

93
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,791
This has happened before, too...

94
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:55,291
I don't know all the details,

95
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:57,875
but apparently she caused a
big uproar at East Genetics

96
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:59,458
before she transferred here.

97
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:01,750
Any time a Limiter
dares to lay a hand on her,

98
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:03,458
she shows them no mercy.

99
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:05,458
She'll do the same to you!

100
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:06,750
I would hate to see
you get wrapped up

101
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,875
in this tale of tragedy!

102
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:18,583
Miss Satellizer,
can we talk for a second?

103
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:23,125
Hey, hold on a minute!

104
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:48,625
Oh no...

105
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:52,833
My glasses...
where are my glasses?

106
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:11,541
I--

107
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:18,250
Wait. Don't go.

108
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:23,625
Look, I know it's my fault
you have all those injuries...

109
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:25,041
And it's my fault

110
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:26,833
that you lost your match
during the Carnival yesterday.

111
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:30,750
And I know a simple
"I'm sorry" won't cut it, but...

112
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:39,500
Please... Please let me go.

113
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:42,750
Let me go.

114
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:45,791
I just wanna talk, okay?

115
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:50,541
You have no right...
to touch me like that!

116
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:52,250
Satellizer, please wait!

117
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:55,500
I'm finished with you...

118
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:57,541
Don't ever come near me again!

119
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:03,666
Don't take another step!

120
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:21,666
Honestly, I never thought
even you would sink so low!

121
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,375
Show some dignity in defeat!

122
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:31,125
Is she the new rank one?

123
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:32,500
She is.

124
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:35,208
Taking your resentment
out on a poor underclassman?

125
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:37,500
You should be ashamed.

126
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:40,541
Hm...? Giving me a
dirty look are you?

127
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:42,541
If you're bitter about the
results of the Carnival,

128
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:43,916
don't blame me!

129
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,458
I didn't find my victory
that satisfying either.

130
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,833
However, putting our
personal feelings aside,

131
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:52,041
the fact of the matter is

132
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:54,750
that I'm rank 1
whether you like it or not!

133
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:56,791
The Untouchable Queen
has been dethroned

134
00:08:56,875 --> 00:09:00,125
and the Angel of Binding
holds her on a short leash!

135
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,750
So turn tail and lick your
wounds until the next Carnival,

136
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:05,958
where you might be able
to win your dignity back.

137
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:09,625
Or perhaps you should just give
up on your title altogether...

138
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:10,708
It looks like you've found

139
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:13,083
a cute little
Limiter to play with.

140
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:15,833
I think you might make a better
queen of the kitchen, anyway...

141
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:17,250
I, for one, certainly
wouldn't miss you

142
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:19,416
if you took a
permanent vacation!

143
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,958
Oh, forgive me...

144
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:24,000
I forget that a gorilla like
you is only suited for violence.

145
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:25,375
You are untouchable,

146
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:28,541
meaning that no one
would ever want to touch you.

147
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:30,958
You mean Satellizer
doesn't have a Limiter,

148
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:32,500
even though she was rank 1?

149
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:34,500
No... No, she never has.

150
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:35,791
I don't understand...

151
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:38,125
She's a second year
Pandora, isn't she?

152
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:39,708
You won't give up, will you...?

153
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:42,916
I can tell by that obstinate
glare you're shooting at me.

154
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,291
That suits me just fine.

155
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,416
Even if you somehow
manage to defeat me,

156
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,750
I have nothing to lose.

157
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:49,250
Unless we battle
in the Carnival,

158
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:51,416
our ranks will remain the same!

159
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:55,000
If I must drill my superiority
into your thick skull,

160
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:56,166
then drill I shall!

161
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,083
No!

162
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:58,375
Pandora fighting
anywhere outside

163
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:00,166
of the Carnival is against
the school rules...!

164
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,833
Can't they resolve this
without being violent?

165
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:04,458
We should stop them
before they get hurt!

166
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:05,833
It's no big deal,

167
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:08,833
fights like these are a
dime a dozen, trust me.

168
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:12,958
Volt, Weapon... deploy!

169
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,833
Chains of Binding!

170
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:21,833
Woah!

171
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:23,166
She must be serious...

172
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,291
Those weapons
are designed to kill.

173
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,166
Prepare yourself, Satellizer!

174
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:35,708
I'll make you rue
the day you met me!

175
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:57,625
Don't think you can run away...!

176
00:10:57,708 --> 00:11:00,583
This time I won't be content
with simply defeating you!

177
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:02,125
No... I want more.

178
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:03,458
I'm going to etch the scars

179
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:06,875
of this bitter defeat into
every inch of your body!

180
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:13,791
Take that!

181
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:34,791
Drop dead!

182
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:38,541
Die die die die!

183
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:41,333
She deflected
every one of those?!

184
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:57,750
Oh no... Even if it was her
fault for picking a fight,

185
00:11:57,833 --> 00:12:00,291
I can't help but
feel sorry for her.

186
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:04,208
She's so strong...

187
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:08,875
Nice try... but sorry...

188
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:11,125
I'm not finished with you yet!

189
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,458
I don't care if this
breaks the school rules!

190
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:28,000
She's using Pandora Mode?

191
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:30,541
I didn't know any
second-years could do that!

192
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,333
You have to stop this!

193
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:33,916
Miss Roland...

194
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,291
Pandora Mode is only authorized
under real combat situations,

195
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:38,666
not squabbles between students!

196
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,958
For me...

197
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:42,375
This battle is
as real as it gets!

198
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:57,791
Satellizer!

199
00:12:57,875 --> 00:12:59,625
Hey, you aren't hurt, are you?

200
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:02,500
It's him again...

201
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:08,041
Even though he touches me...
it... it isn't bad...

202
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:12,041
Who's that?

203
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:15,208
I've never seen him...

204
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:20,208
Hey, wait...!

205
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:22,083
You need your weapon
to fight don't you?

206
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,041
You have some nerve!

207
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:26,750
Ignoring me in the
middle of our duel!

208
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:28,958
Hey Satellizer, look out!

209
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,375
Discarding your
weapon and chatting

210
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:39,041
with a boy when I activate
Pandora Mode...?

211
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:41,166
I can't help but
think you're mocking me.

212
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:44,458
I'll have you know,
I don't take kindly to that.

213
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:47,166
Please stop this Miss Roland,
you've done enough already!

214
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:49,791
I'll stop when this
wench has been pulverized

215
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:51,791
and not a second sooner!

216
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:02,583
Stop it...! Stop it!

217
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:04,458
You picked a bad
time to soften up--

218
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:05,708
if you don't break free soon

219
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:09,291
I'm afraid your body
will be torn to shreds!

220
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:11,458
This is... just too cruel!

221
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:21,375
Once again, victory is mine!

222
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:23,333
You have no one
to blame but yourself!

223
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:25,750
So much for the Queen!

224
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:32,458
I must say, this
Pandora Mode of mine

225
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:34,791
is even more
impressive than I thought!

226
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:37,083
I believe a celebration
is in order.

227
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:40,041
A victory such as this is
deserving of a trophy...!

228
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:42,666
Gold would be nice, but if I
chopped off one of your arms,

229
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,541
it would be more personal!

230
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:54,875
Please! Stop!

231
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:57,875
Pardon?

232
00:14:57,958 --> 00:14:59,875
You've already won,
haven't you...?!

233
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:01,958
Isn't that enough?!

234
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:03,958
Just leave her alone!

235
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:05,166
Listen, little boy...

236
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,333
I don't know who you
are and I don't care...

237
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:10,208
If you wanna be a white knight,
then go do it somewhere else!

238
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:13,250
I worked hard for
this victory, you know...

239
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:15,666
I won't have you spoil it!

240
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:22,833
This fight isn't over yet...

241
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:26,125
Pandora Mode! Activate!

242
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:51,125
No... you can use it, too...?

243
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:53,958
But I thought I was
supposed to be the only one...!

244
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:55,666
I already beat you...

245
00:15:58,083 --> 00:15:59,416
This changes nothing...!

246
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,666
I can still win!

247
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:14,708
No... how could you?

248
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:18,583
I'm rank one... aren't I?

249
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:23,583
Whoa... that was amazing.

250
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:26,333
Her Pandora mode's even
stronger than Miss Roland's...!

251
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:28,458
She beat her in a single blow!

252
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:39,416
I... will never forgive you!

253
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:42,500
I refuse to acknowledge
this defeat...!

254
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:44,708
Do you understand me?!

255
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:53,083
I won't have you wreaking havoc
like that all over the school...

256
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:56,291
Those skills are for fighting
Nova, not your fellow students.

257
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:59,416
Drop your weapon and
disengage Pandora Mode now...

258
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,333
Its use is still
experimental, you know.

259
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:05,375
There could be any number of
very dangerous side effects...

260
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:06,958
It's not worth it.

261
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:10,833
You weren't injured back
there, were you, Kazuya?

262
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:12,541
No... I'm fine.

263
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:32,875
Who are those two?

264
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:34,125
They're school staff.

265
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:36,541
You'll be seeing a lot
of them from now on...

266
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:39,583
The one on the left is our
training instructor Yumi Kim,

267
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:42,791
and the one on the right is
our medic, Elise Schmitz.

268
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,916
Back when they were
students, four years ago,

269
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,083
they fought together in
the Eighth Nova Clash...

270
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,625
They don't like to brag about
it, but they were quite strong!

271
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:52,875
Four years ago...

272
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:55,583
That means they fought
alongside my sister.

273
00:17:56,291 --> 00:18:00,708
I see... So at least some
people made it out alive...

274
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:02,583
Okay, how do you
want to handle this?

275
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:04,458
Their injuries
don't seem too bad.

276
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:05,541
It's up to you.

277
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:07,291
Fine. You, come with me...!

278
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:09,375
You're going to be
spending some time

279
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:12,333
in the brig for
breaking school rules!

280
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:13,416
My goodness...!

281
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,833
Well, it serves you right!

282
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:17,166
That goes for you too!

283
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,458
Never seen him before.

284
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:26,083
But you've heard of him...

285
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:28,416
That's Kazuha's little brother.

286
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:38,708
The pairing of Pandora and
Limiter is decided by you...

287
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:40,583
...not us.

288
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:44,416
So please, take your time and
be confident in your choice.

289
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,541
I pray you'll become
a fine Limiter...

290
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:50,208
...and support your partner in
times of peace and battle alike.

291
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:53,041
I'll do my best,
Sister Margaret!

292
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:54,083
That is all.

293
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,125
Yes, ma'am...

294
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:57,500
Thank you.

295
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:07,875
Room 302...

296
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,291
Here we go.

297
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:22,791
She hasn't been
back to her room...

298
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:25,625
I haven't seen her all day--
where'd she run off to?

299
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:32,208
So, my name's Arthur Clipton...

300
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:34,666
I'm a first year student
here, the same as you.

301
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:37,500
I live right next door, so
I'm sure you'll see me a lot.

302
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:39,500
I'm Kazuya Aoi...

303
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:40,875
Nice to meet you.

304
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:42,958
But wait...
you're a transfer student...?

305
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:45,833
Seems kinda weird to switch
schools in the middle of a term.

306
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:47,041
I guess so...

307
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:49,458
So, hey... Quick question.

308
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:50,625
What's up?

309
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:52,083
It's about a Pandora I met.

310
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:54,000
Ya gotta narrow it
down more than that.

311
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:55,500
Well, she's a second-year

312
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:57,708
and her name's Satellizer
el Bridget, maybe you know her?

313
00:19:57,791 --> 00:19:58,875
Yeah, I know her.

314
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:01,916
I know enough to stay
far away from her.

315
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,833
She may be a Pandora, but she
doesn't trust Limiters at all...

316
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:06,500
Pick that girl
as your big sister

317
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:08,791
and you might not live
long enough to regret it.

318
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:09,958
Wait, my big sister?

319
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:12,000
That's what you
call your Pandora.

320
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:12,916
I see...

321
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,500
I made sure to choose carefully,

322
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:17,583
so my big sister isn't weird or
violent or anything like that...

323
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:18,916
On the contrary,

324
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,291
she's pretty and smart and
she's always nice to me.

325
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,583
Oh... kay...

326
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:24,250
Oh, you want me
to tell you more?

327
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:25,583
Well, she's pretty famous,

328
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:27,583
so I'm sure you'd hear
all about her soon enough,

329
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:31,166
but what the heck... I've got
a minute, so I'll humor you.

330
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:32,375
How nice of you.

331
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:34,041
She's the Angel of Binding...

332
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:36,375
Her name's Ganessa Roland.

333
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:40,125
She's the girl who won
today's Carnival, by the way...

334
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:41,333
I didn't get to
see it for myself,

335
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:43,458
but I was cheering
for her the whole time.

336
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:45,250
I've been wanting to
congratulate her all day,

337
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:47,916
but I haven't been able
to find her anywhere.

338
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:08,000
What's wrong with me...?

339
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:11,541
Why did I think
she was my sister?

340
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:29,416
Even after all that, I never
got a chance to apologize...

341
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:41,333
A first-year boy and a
transfer student to boot?

342
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:43,125
Fascinating.

343
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:46,833
But the question remains:

344
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:50,291
Is he qualified to
receive my blessings...?

345
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:52,041
Show me.

346
00:21:56,833 --> 00:22:01,250
Oh my... He is
rather cute, isn't he?

347
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:05,791
I, Miyabi Kannazuki, deem
him worthy to receive baptism.

348
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:11,041
As the Limiter Eater,
it's my job to gobble him up!

349
00:23:41,208 --> 00:23:42,875
I'd like you to consider
selecting me to be your Limiter.

350
00:23:42,958 --> 00:23:44,416
Do you actually
think a second year...

351
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,666
That's one of the maneuvers
they teach you as a third year!

352
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:46,875
If you dare to lay even
one finger on this boy,

353
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:48,958
then I assure you
you'll regret it.

354
00:23:49,041 --> 00:23:50,708
Next time: "Accelerating Turn."
