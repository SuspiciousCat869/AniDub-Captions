1
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:09,416
If I asked nicely, could
I convince you to surrender?

2
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:15,041
You don't need to say anything--
I already know the answer.

3
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:18,125
Pleased to meet you,
I'm Ticy Phenyl...

4
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:20,708
Third year, rank 3,
the Silent Confidant.

5
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:22,416
And I'm Chiffon Fairchild...

6
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,166
Third year, rank 1...

7
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:27,833
"The Unparalleled Monster."

8
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:33,375
I'm going to die here, aren't I?

9
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:03,458
I'm still... alive...

10
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:22,208
Still breathing... over there...
little miss... rank two?

11
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:28,458
Ganessa, no!

12
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:31,000
Are you okay...?!
Answer me! Ganessa!

13
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:33,375
You can't die on me,
you gotta hold on...!

14
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:36,333
What were you thinking,
doing something like that?!

15
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:39,083
It... was my duty...

16
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:40,458
What?

17
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:44,041
I have to protect...
my comrades...

18
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:47,916
No... I have to protect
those weaker than me...

19
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,791
It's my duty... as a Pandora.

20
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:55,208
Just hold on a little
longer. It'll be fine.

21
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:58,833
Watch, I'll take you straight
to the recovery center...!

22
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:00,708
Pandora get injuries
like this all the time

23
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:03,416
and they patch them
right up no problem!

24
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,166
I'm sorry ma'am.

25
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,875
I shouldn't have picked
you up without asking.

26
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:13,958
Oh no, I got a little
dirt on your face...

27
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:15,500
You always try so hard

28
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:18,083
to stay clean and pretty, too,
I'm really screwing this up.

29
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:19,458
Let's try again, okay...?

30
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:20,833
If you didn't like
the piggyback maybe

31
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:22,250
we can do something else...

32
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:23,250
Oh! I know!

33
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:25,208
I'll carry you like a princess!

34
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:27,458
I know you don't mind that!

35
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:29,375
That's better, isn't it?

36
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:30,458
Tell me it's okay...!

37
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:32,833
One word is all
I need... anything...!

38
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:35,166
Just please talk to me!

39
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,916
"Why are you crying
so much, you fool?"...

40
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,833
"Stop wasting
time and carry me!"

41
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:42,833
Scold me like you always do--
I know I deserve it!

42
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:45,666
Please!

43
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:49,125
I'm sorry Arthur,
but it's over... she's...

44
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:50,541
Don't tell me she's dead...!

45
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:52,166
Ganessa wouldn't die so easy...!

46
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,875
She's much stronger
than that...!

47
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:56,833
She can't be dead!

48
00:04:56,916 --> 00:04:58,875
This isn't the end,
you hear me?!

49
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:21,291
It's strange, you know...

50
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:23,250
I never wanted
to make friends...

51
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:24,666
For the longest time,

52
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:28,625
the only person I cared about
at this academy was me.

53
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:32,250
Then this happens...

54
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:33,625
I don't understand.

55
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:37,125
If I'm not supposed
to care about them,

56
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:39,833
then why do I feel so angry?!

57
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:43,875
Stigmata Activation
Rate 180... 200...

58
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:48,625
300... 400... Entering
abnormal activity levels.

59
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:51,458
She's switching to Nova
Mode of her own volition...

60
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:54,083
The same way that girl
did four years ago.

61
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:27,000
Quadruple Acceleration?!

62
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:29,625
There is no way she can
keep up with that speed!

63
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:33,750
She blocked it!

64
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:39,875
Amazing!

65
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:41,291
She held off
every single attack!

66
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:43,083
What is this?!

67
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:48,041
I've never seen
anything like it.

68
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:50,416
So this is your true strength...

69
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:26,958
Finally... it's all over now...

70
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:31,541
Please, kill me... end it...

71
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:34,208
Please... kill me...

72
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:43,958
No!!!

73
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:46,583
She's back to normal--she's
not a Nova anymore...!

74
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,083
The fight is over now...!

75
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:51,291
She's no different than you
Satella--you can't kill her!

76
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:53,166
Cathy has suffered
enough already!

77
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,333
It's not fair
for her to die here!

78
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:56,625
And I don't want to see

79
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:58,916
my partner take the life
of one of our allies...

80
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,166
of one of my friends!

81
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:07,541
Our ally...? Your friend...

82
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:16,666
Abnormal Stigmata
activity is causing

83
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:19,666
a dependency on Nova
attributes in the subject.

84
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,833
There's no turning back...

85
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:48,375
Stigmata Activation Rate:
200... 180... 120...

86
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:51,375
She couldn't be reducing those
Stigmata Levels on her own...

87
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:54,958
No. This is her
Limiter's doing, isn't it?

88
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,875
Satella... you're okay...

89
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:14,916
Ganessa!

90
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,291
Kazuya, quick, give me a hand!

91
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:18,041
Ganessa's still alive!

92
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:21,875
These are good tidings indeed!

93
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:27,500
I have to know...

94
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:28,916
Why did you stop...?

95
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,708
Even after I begged
you to kill me?

96
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:35,583
I did what I did for
the sake of my partner...

97
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:37,291
So he wouldn't lose hope.

98
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:44,166
Besides, if you're
half as good at writing

99
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,541
as you are at fighting Nova,

100
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:48,083
it'd be a crime if I didn't
get to read your work!

101
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:52,041
He taught me
something important.

102
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:54,416
What was it?

103
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,541
Because you showed me that...

104
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:57,583
...that when I'm with you...

105
00:09:57,666 --> 00:10:00,708
I can protect the world
my sister fought to save!

106
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:02,666
He taught me what
I have to live for...

107
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:03,833
The goal that we must be willing

108
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:06,375
to sacrifice our
lives to protect.

109
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:07,875
Something to protect...

110
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:11,083
Maybe I've had the wrong
idea about this after all...

111
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:29,000
All finished here...?

112
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:31,000
Well that's a relief.

113
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:41,625
Thank you for the
hard work, Yujin.

114
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:43,750
My pleasure Miss Chiffon.

115
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:45,250
You were great, Abel!

116
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:47,291
Always happy to lend a hand!

117
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:49,916
All enemy Pandora who entered
the Ravensborne Nucleochade

118
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,833
have been eliminated
by our emergency team.

119
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:54,875
What about the Nova?

120
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:56,083
Only Target 1 remains,

121
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:58,500
but its core has
been badly damaged.

122
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:02,375
It should just be a matter
of time before it's defeated.

123
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:04,250
The last one... Let's do this!

124
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:05,666
Right...

125
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,708
It's gone!

126
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:16,083
Okay, so now what?

127
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:17,708
Target 1 has disappeared!

128
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:19,500
Make a sweep of the area, now!

129
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:22,000
Already underway!

130
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:45,083
Miss President...?
Is something wrong?

131
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:47,375
Control room...!
The enemy Pandora are--!

132
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:53,958
What now?!

133
00:11:58,291 --> 00:11:59,791
Extra-dimensional
activity detected

134
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:03,416
in the vicinity of
the Holy Remains!

135
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:16,250
Nova detected and
transfer has been confirmed!

136
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:18,666
Put it on the monitor!

137
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:29,583
A Nova!

138
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:35,541
Confirmed: It's Target 1!

139
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:36,833
It must have acquired
the coordinates

140
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:40,000
through the stigmata it
attached to the Pandora.

141
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:43,916
Attention: This is a
message for all Pandora

142
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,458
inside the
Ravensborne Nucleochede.

143
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:48,833
The Nova must not advance...

144
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:50,666
Under no circumstances
can they be

145
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,958
allowed to reach
the Holy Remains.

146
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:05,875
You must protect them...
I beg of you.

147
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:09,666
Good timing!

148
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,041
So this thing is a Nova?

149
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:12,250
It always comes down

150
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,458
to a matter of brawn
over brains, doesn't it?

151
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:16,666
Well, we can't think
the Nova to death.

152
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,166
Save the chit-chat for
the after-party, girls.

153
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:22,333
I agree.

154
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:25,208
Okay Andrei... get
ready to back me up.

155
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:27,583
Of course, my lady.

156
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:45,083
Okay, team...
Let's give this our best!

157
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:02,500
Satella! What's wrong?!

158
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:06,416
Destroy it...! Kill me!

159
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,708
That Stigmata...
It looks just like Cathy's!

160
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:19,041
Stigmata have entered
abnormal activity range.

161
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:21,500
The Nova have recognized
the Pandora's abilities...

162
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:24,250
Now they're going to
use them to destroy us.

163
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:34,250
You have to fight it!

164
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:44,666
I... I cannot move!

165
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:45,916
What's going on?!

166
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,541
It can't be...

167
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:49,958
No mistaking it...

168
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:52,041
This is a Freezing!

169
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:53,583
It's Satellizer!

170
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:56,125
She's turning into a Nova...!

171
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:06,750
Target 1 is approaching
the holy remains...!

172
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:09,875
All Pandora remain
unable to act!

173
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:26,666
So in the end, all that we
can do is sit here and watch?!

174
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:29,916
I refuse to accept
defeat, even now.

175
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,083
Defeat?

176
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:33,958
Not yet... It's not over.

177
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,833
Pandora Mode, Activate!

178
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:50,333
What is this?

179
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:51,583
Pandora Mode, of course...

180
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:52,958
It allows us to keep moving,

181
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:55,458
even within a Freezing Area.

182
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:58,416
Well... this should
make things easier...

183
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:14,166
It's reversing our Pandora Mode!

184
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,000
They can do that?!

185
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:18,291
It sure looks like it.

186
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:21,166
The Freezing Area...
It's just too strong...!

187
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:28,500
What can we do?!

188
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:29,416
I don't know...

189
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,416
I've never seen this before!

190
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:35,833
Target One has reached
the holy remains!

191
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:37,500
You can't give up!

192
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:49,166
Help me...

193
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:57,541
Help me... Please...

194
00:16:57,625 --> 00:17:02,083
Kazuya... I need you to help me!

195
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:20,958
I believe in you Satella,
I know you can do this...!

196
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:22,333
And not because of the Sacreds,

197
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,125
but because you never give up...

198
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:26,333
...because you're my partner!

199
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:32,916
Kazuya...! Kazuya!

200
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:44,791
I know you...

201
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:50,666
You're Kazuha... aren't you.

202
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:53,083
You must protect them...

203
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:55,083
The people that you hold dear

204
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:57,458
and all of their dreams as well.

205
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,625
They're your strength...

206
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:02,958
The hope carried
in your Stigmata.

207
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:25,958
On my back, I carry
the hopes and dreams

208
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:28,000
of the people I hold dear...

209
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:30,708
I must protect them,
no matter what.

210
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,625
This feeling of warmth...

211
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:43,958
It's an Ereinbar Set...

212
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,708
But he hasn't received
baptism, has he?

213
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:50,375
I never knew Kazuya
had power like this...

214
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:53,333
I feel so warm and fuzzy inside!

215
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:57,000
All right, team...
Let's finish this!

216
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:32,333
Target 1 has been
immobilized...!

217
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:34,000
They did it!

218
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:43,291
Seems it was no mistake
that she encountered that boy.

219
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:45,125
We should be grateful.

220
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:05,583
Miss Satella...

221
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:11,416
Kazuya... I spoke to your
sister before I woke up.

222
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:14,708
Thank you, Kazuha.

223
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:17,708
Watch out!

224
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:20,750
You're okay, right?

225
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:25,583
All thanks to you.

226
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:26,958
I'm glad you're back.

227
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:29,750
The Untouchable Queen
has a soft side, huh?

228
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:56,375
By the way, Miss Milena?

229
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:57,500
Hm?

230
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:58,875
I've been thinking it over

231
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:01,458
and I decided I want to
join the Chevalier reserves.

232
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:03,333
You... changed your mind?

233
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:05,208
Thanks to something
you said to me...

234
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:07,666
You made me realize what
we Pandora should live for.

235
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:11,125
But... Cathy, what about
your dreams to be a novelist?

236
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:13,791
Don't worry, I'll still
make that come true...

237
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:16,625
Besides... I made a promise.

238
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:20,625
Rana!

239
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:22,958
Now, it is time for us to go!

240
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,500
That's right, we
still need to stop by

241
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:27,083
and see Ganessa, don't we?

242
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:28,083
Yep!

243
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:29,333
Take my arm, Kazuya...

244
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:31,500
Ah, okay, okay...

245
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:33,916
Uh, excuse us, ma'am.

246
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:39,708
This is it.

247
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:41,500
Come in.

248
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:43,833
Hey, sorry we're... Oh!

249
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:46,750
Why are we not
entering the room?

250
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:47,791
Satella...!

251
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:49,541
You're visiting Ganessa, too?

252
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:52,208
I suppose...

253
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:53,916
I understand you're surprised...

254
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,291
I certainly am...

255
00:21:55,375 --> 00:21:58,041
If this keeps up we might
even see snow in July!

256
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:05,750
I... just wanted...
to thank you.

257
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:07,541
Now, if you'll excuse me...

258
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:12,166
Come by my
room later, all right?

259
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:15,458
She really has changed.

260
00:22:15,541 --> 00:22:18,958
We can scarcely call her
the Untouchable Queen now...

261
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:22,666
But she was long overdue
for an attitude adjustment.

262
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:25,916
Are you okay, ma'am?!

263
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,541
Of course!

264
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:35,583
I'll get it right this time...

265
00:22:35,666 --> 00:22:37,500
You'll have your baptism.

266
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:42,041
Which one...? I can't decide...!

267
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,708
Kazuya! What a
pleasant surprise!

268
00:22:44,791 --> 00:22:46,291
What are you doing
here at this hour?

269
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:48,375
Uh, well, Satella told
me to come by her room,

270
00:22:48,458 --> 00:22:49,833
so here I am...

271
00:22:49,916 --> 00:22:51,250
What should I do?

272
00:22:51,333 --> 00:22:54,500
I have to wear something!

273
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,250
Satellizer, are you presentable?

274
00:22:57,333 --> 00:22:58,791
Kazuya is here to see you.

275
00:22:58,875 --> 00:23:00,500
Am I here too early?

276
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:06,500
So... hey... where
are your clothes?

277
00:23:07,416 --> 00:23:08,333
I was just...

278
00:23:08,416 --> 00:23:09,791
You were planning
to seduce Kazuya

279
00:23:09,875 --> 00:23:11,916
with those lacy
undergarments, were you not?

280
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,166
My goodness, how shameless!

281
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:15,833
But I shall not be defeated!

282
00:23:15,916 --> 00:23:19,083
Look Kazuya, I am even
more shameless than she!

283
00:23:19,166 --> 00:23:21,541
What...?! I won't lose...!

284
00:23:21,625 --> 00:23:23,625
Not to you... Not to anyone!

285
00:23:24,166 --> 00:23:27,291
Ladies, could we
maybe... not do this?

286
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:31,791
It's as I feared.

287
00:23:31,875 --> 00:23:35,375
This proves that the Stigmata
truly are a doubled-edged sword.

288
00:23:35,458 --> 00:23:37,750
It is because they are
a double-edged sword

289
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:40,708
that they give birth to the
strength of our Pandora.

290
00:23:40,791 --> 00:23:43,000
But Gengo...
I mean, Professor Aoi--

291
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:45,000
Good day, Sister Margaret...

292
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:50,166
This was but a trial...
Now it all begins.
