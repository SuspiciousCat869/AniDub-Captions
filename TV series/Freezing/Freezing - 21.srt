00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:21,791
[AMELIA breathes heavily]

2
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,583
[JULIA]
What you 'hold dear?'

3
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:30,791
Why do you hold dear,

4
00:00:30,875 --> 00:00:33,791
this girl who's
turning into a Nova?

5
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:36,250
What are you
talking about?

6
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:42,458
No.

7
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:45,000
They didn't give you
the Mark IV, did they?

8
00:00:45,083 --> 00:00:48,625
Not quite. I decided
to use it on myself.

9
00:00:48,708 --> 00:00:50,416
Why would you do that?

10
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,000
[AMELIA]
I didn't have a choice.

11
00:00:52,083 --> 00:00:55,750
This is the only way to expose
what's been going on here!

12
00:00:55,833 --> 00:00:59,750
The world needs to see this
place for what it truly is!

13
00:01:08,916 --> 00:01:10,750
You have to let me go.

14
00:01:10,833 --> 00:01:11,833
Don't do this.

15
00:01:11,916 --> 00:01:13,750
[AMELIA chuckles lightly]

16
00:01:13,833 --> 00:01:15,500
So what, after everything
that's happened,

17
00:01:15,583 --> 00:01:17,250
you're taking the
side of Chevalier?

18
00:01:17,333 --> 00:01:18,583
Of course I'm not!

19
00:01:18,666 --> 00:01:20,375
Then let me go!

20
00:01:21,166 --> 00:01:22,416
Stop!

21
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,750
I mean it!

22
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:26,541
Get out of my way, I don't
wanna have to hurt you.

23
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:31,000
I understand what
you're trying to do,

24
00:01:31,083 --> 00:01:32,458
but there's no need
for it anymore.

25
00:01:32,541 --> 00:01:34,125
Of course there's
a need for it.

26
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:35,916
This is the only way
we can prevent

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,333
more tragedies from happening!

28
00:01:37,416 --> 00:01:40,708
The El Bridget Family will
handle things from now on.

29
00:01:40,791 --> 00:01:43,708
Your family's going
to get involved?

30
00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:49,708
[AMELIA] But... why?

31
00:01:49,791 --> 00:01:51,625
Technically I'm
only half El Bridget,

32
00:01:51,708 --> 00:01:53,958
but I'm still
part of the family.

33
00:01:54,041 --> 00:01:55,291
[AMELIA gasps]

34
00:01:58,666 --> 00:01:59,791
[AMELIA cries]

35
00:01:59,875 --> 00:02:01,166
[AMELIA] First Elizabeth.

36
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:04,041
And now you too.

37
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:05,708
[SATELLIZER] Amelia.

38
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:10,333
I told you I returned to protect
the things that I hold dear.

39
00:02:10,416 --> 00:02:12,041
You care about me?

40
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:14,250
I'm an E-Pandora.

41
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:17,291
And a, a half transformed Nova.

42
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:18,625
I'm the enemy.

43
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:20,625
You're a true
Pandora to me.

44
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:23,666
And nothing is ever
going to change that.

45
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:26,708
You're a good
friend, Amelia.

46
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:29,416
So do the right thing.

47
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:37,875
Somehow my freezing
has been neutralized!

48
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:43,208
That must be
her limiter.

49
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:21,125
[alarm sounds]

50
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:22,833
[FEMALE ANNOUNCEMENT]
Issuing Level One Alert!

51
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:25,416
Targets are
non-compliant E-Pandora!

52
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,541
I repeat.
Issuing a Level One Alert!

53
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:30,750
Why, this is rather
troublesome, is it not?

54
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:33,625
Did she say that the
targets are E-Pandora?

55
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:35,083
[ANDREI] It's worse
than you think.

56
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:36,666
[RANA and CATHY] Huh?

57
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:40,250
[ANDREI] It's a rebellion, and
Amelia's pulling the strings.

58
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:42,666
And they're even using
another friend of mine.

59
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,250
At this rate, I won't
have any friends left!

60
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:48,541
But I'll fight for them.

61
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:50,541
This means the rumors that
Chevalier planned to use

62
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:52,708
the Mark IV again
are probably true.

63
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:55,291
After human life was lost
in past experiments,

64
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:57,041
how could they do such a thing?

65
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:58,708
This is simply too much!

66
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:00,291
[CATHY] No, wait!

67
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:03,166
[ELIZABETH] Andrei.

68
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,416
[ANDREI] Huh?

69
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,291
[CATHY]
Hold on, Rana!

70
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:09,958
You need to try and calm down!

71
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:12,333
[RANA] Kindly take your
hands off me please!

72
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:13,666
[CATHY] What are
you planning to do?

73
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,416
[RANA] Huh?

74
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:18,458
You don't even
know, do you?

75
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:21,916
I cannot tolerate this
injustice any longer!

76
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,541
[CATHY]
Wait for me!

77
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:26,125
[CATHY gasps]

[SATELLIZER yells]

79
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,458
[CATHY]
A Sonic Wave.

80
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:38,416
Without a Volt Weapon?

81
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:46,166
[SATELLIZER] Her power's
unbelievable!

82
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:48,750
Rana, what are you doing?

83
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:52,750
Fear not, Satellizer, I will
do what I can to protect you!

84
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:59,250
Now we shall see how you
handle dual opponents! Yah!

85
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:02,125
Oh!

86
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:04,750
[JULIA] Traitors will
receive no mercy!

87
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:06,291
And that means you!

88
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:08,791
[RANA]
She's executing a Tempest!

89
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:11,750
[RANA screams]

90
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,250
[KAZUYA] Rana!

91
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:19,375
Hang in there, okay?

92
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:22,458
Thank you, Kazuya.

93
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:25,166
I will do all in my power
to 'hang in there.'

94
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,250
[SATELLIZER]
She's strong.

95
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:31,041
One of the five most
powerful in the world.

96
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:33,458
Julia Munberk.

97
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,708
[ELIZABETH] I'm going.

98
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:37,916
[ANDREI] Where?

99
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,916
To help out Amelia
and the others.

100
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
[CHIFFON] I'm so sorry
to say it, Elizabeth,

101
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:44,375
but I'm afraid I can't
let you do that.

102
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:47,583
Chiffon. Why are you
standing in my way?

103
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:49,416
You know keeping
my friends safe is

104
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,083
my number one priority
in any given situation.

105
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:54,375
I cannot allow my
fellow Genetics members

106
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:55,958
to endanger
themselves and others

107
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:59,416
by acting as accomplices to
these E-Pandora traitors.

108
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,041
I hope you can
respect my position.

109
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:05,416
I understand, but...

110
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,416
I'm afraid that's
not going to stop me.

111
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:12,166
So I'm asking you
to step aside.

112
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,125
Now.

113
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:16,166
I already told you.

114
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:19,083
Before anything else, I am
a proud member of Chevalier.

115
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:21,333
What I do, I do for
the preservation

116
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:23,625
and betterment of human kind.

117
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:26,291
If my faith in that waivers,

118
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:30,000
then the Pandora will lose
the reason for their existence.

119
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:33,333
[ELIZABETH] There are three
women in this world

120
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:35,791
I respect more than anyone else.

121
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:38,333
There's my mother,
obviously.

122
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:41,083
And then Amelia, who
I met here at this lab.

123
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:42,875
There was also another,

124
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:46,416
someone, so smart, I couldn't
help but respect her.

125
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,083
As much as I hate to admit it,

126
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:52,041
that young woman was you,
Chiffon Fairchild.

127
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:53,666
What happened to you?

128
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:56,000
I wish you were the same
girl I once adored

129
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:57,583
and deeply respected.

130
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:59,375
If you were, I might
heed your warnings

131
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:01,166
and listen to
what you're saying.

132
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,916
But you're not.
You're a different girl today.

133
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,666
Looking at you now,
all I can feel is contempt.

134
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:15,750
[ANDREI] Eli.

135
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:17,166
No need to come
along, Andrei,

136
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:20,375
I believe I have things
covered from here.

137
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:24,375
You have to realize there's no
chance I'm not going with you.

138
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:33,625
[chuckles] Suit yourself.

139
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:40,125
[ELIZABETH] I suppose it is your
own fault for being attracted...

140
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:46,250
...to girls like me.

141
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:50,458
Let's go.

142
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:52,666
Of course. My Lady.

143
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:08,708
Don't push yourself.

144
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:12,250
Thank you for your concern,
but I shall be just fine!

145
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:18,000
I suppose we only have one
choice at this present juncture.

146
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:42,250
Oh wow. Both of them?

147
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:43,666
[CATHY] Wait!

148
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:46,958
[RANA and SATELLIZER gasp]

149
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:48,333
[CATHY]
You can't do this,

150
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:51,166
Stigmata-release takes
too much of a physical toll.

151
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,208
I can handle Julia.

152
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:55,250
Just get Amelia out of here.

153
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:58,833
Cathy, you don't
have to do this.

154
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:00,083
It's okay.

155
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,833
You're still
recovering, right?

156
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:04,250
This is something I have
to do, so just let me.

157
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:06,041
If you believe this is
the right course to take,

158
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:07,666
then I'm with you.

159
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:08,958
But, why?

160
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:12,125
[CATHY] Because I owe you
my life, Satellizer.

161
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:26,250
And more importantly, you're
one of my dearest friends.

162
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:29,041
[CATHY]
I'm on her level.

163
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:32,708
I'm world-ranked too.
I can take care of her.

164
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:34,083
[AMELIA] Hm.

165
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:38,833
[CATHY]
Get out of here.

166
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:41,833
[SATELLIZER] I owe you
big time for this!

167
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:43,041
You two, as well.

168
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:44,541
[KAZUYA] Mm.

169
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:52,208
[JULIA] You said you're
world-ranked and on my level.

170
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:54,375
Your data is incorrect.

171
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:56,375
According to my calculations,

172
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:58,500
you do rank in the top five.

173
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:02,958
However, it should be noted that
you are dead last on that list.

174
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:05,291
[CATHY] I'm really
in last place?

175
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:11,000
Guess I better do
something about that then.

176
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:14,000
And what better place
to start than with you?

177
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:17,875
I hate turning a blind eye
in situations like this.

178
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:19,541
But not nearly as much as I hate

179
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:21,791
getting involved in other
people's business.

180
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:28,541
[SATELLIZER]
Where are you going?

181
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:31,583
[AMELIA] Doctor Ohara's research
office is right over there!

182
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:34,416
Don't you understand, Amelia?
You don't have to do this.

183
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,041
The laboratory is already
under investigation; it's over!

184
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:37,875
[FEMALE CHEVALIER 9A]
Don't move!

185
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:39,041
[AMELIA and SATELLIZER gasp]

186
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:44,583
[FEMALE CHEVALIER 9A]
Amelia Evans.

187
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:47,708
You are hereby under arrest
for treason against Chevalier.

188
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:49,625
[FEMALE CHEVALIER 9B] I suggest
the rest of you stand down

189
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:52,541
unless you want to get stuck
with a charge as well.

190
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:53,458
[FEMALE CHEVALIER 9A]
What in the world

191
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:55,291
is wrong with you people?

192
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:57,208
Why would respectable
Pandora like you

193
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:58,833
help a traitor like her?

194
00:11:58,916 --> 00:11:59,958
[FEMALE CHEVALIER 9B]
What you've done

195
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:02,125
is an act of treason
against humanity.

196
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:04,333
You mindless fools.

197
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:06,458
You're the traitors here!

198
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,416
They leave us no choice!
We must fight!

199
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:27,083
[FEMALE CHEVALIER scream]

200
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:30,916
[RANA]
My goodness.

201
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,375
[SATELLIZER]
Those were precise shots

202
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:34,625
that just barely
missed their vitals.

203
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:36,791
It couldn't be...

204
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:40,500
It was... Miss Mably.

205
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:41,875
Elizabeth!

206
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:45,000
[ELIZABETH] The surprise
attack proved effective.

207
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:48,958
[ELIZABETH]
It's a good thing too.

208
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:50,833
Otherwise, those
Chevalier Pandora

209
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:53,791
might've been a lot more
difficult to eliminate.

210
00:12:57,541 --> 00:12:59,166
What exactly do you
think you're doing?

211
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,166
[SATELLIZER gasps]

212
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,583
Unless I'm mistaken,

213
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:04,000
I think I already told you
that this is not your job.

214
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:05,416
You did.

215
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,500
And unless I'm mistaken,
I feel like I made myself clear

216
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:08,875
when I said you were dead wrong.

217
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:10,041
[ELIZABETH sighs]

218
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:12,625
I suppose you did.
And I want to thank you.

219
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,125
[RANA and KAZUYA]
Huh?

220
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:18,291
Whoa. Am I losing my mind,
or did you just say thank you?

221
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:20,125
I don't believe I
care for your tone!

222
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:22,458
What, are you suggesting I'm the
type of person who never says

223
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:23,875
thank you when people
try to help me?

224
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:24,750
[ANDREI chuckles]

225
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:26,833
Oh, come on.
You too, Andrei?

226
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:27,708
[ANDREI clears throat]

227
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:28,875
[ANDREI]
I'm sorry, My Lady.

228
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:30,375
[ELIZABETH] Maybe if
you did something...

229
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:33,416
You injured me so I would get
my family involved, right?

230
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:37,041
Or am I missing something?

231
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:39,041
Whatever do you mean?

232
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:43,833
From here on out,
I'm forbidding all of you

233
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:45,875
from getting involved in
this matter any further.

234
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,750
[SATELLIZER] Ah!
You can't be serious!

235
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:49,958
Listen to me: I cannot
risk all of you

236
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:51,250
being labeled as traitors.

237
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:52,916
[SATELLIZER] I appreciate
your concern.

238
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,583
But right now, all I care
about is helping Amelia.

239
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:58,708
You should try
to be reasonable.

240
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:00,458
How reckless do you have to be

241
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:02,375
before you're
completely satisfied.

242
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:05,333
Hey, remind me because I'm a
little bit fuzzy on the details,

243
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:07,583
but whose recklessness
destroyed her father's company,

244
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:08,250
yours or mine?

245
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:09,666
[gasps]

246
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,291
I'll have you know my actions
were based on principle!

247
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:13,166
And which 'principle'
played the biggest part

248
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:14,500
in ruining your dad's company;

249
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:16,083
I think everyone here...

250
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:18,125
This would appear to be a spat
between two spoiled, rich kids.

251
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:19,875
Oh yeah.

252
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:23,708
The truth is...

253
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:25,250
I know we've had
our differences,

254
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:27,833
but I am so happy you're okay.

255
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:33,250
[CATHY yells]

256
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:39,250
[JULIA yells]

257
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:41,333
[CATHY] Those are some
dangerous attacks!

258
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:43,125
But they don't work
at close range!

259
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:44,541
[JULIA yells]

260
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:48,208
A triple acceleration?

261
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:53,083
[JULIA]
Unbelievable!

262
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:03,833
[JULIA] So this is the Godspeed
of the East. However...

263
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:07,166
[JULIA yells]

264
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,291
[CATHY]
Aahh!

265
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,125
[CATHY groans]

266
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,750
[CATHY] She's using
rapid-fire Sonic Waves

267
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:19,125
in all directions to keep
me from getting close.

268
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:21,041
This fight's over, Cathy.

269
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:24,333
You have zero chance
of defeating me.

270
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:31,416
If I were you, I wouldn't
count me out just yet, Julia.

271
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:41,250
[CATHY] Allow me to show
you the true Godspeed.

272
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:45,416
The realm of the divine.
Quattro Full Acceleration!

273
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:50,291
She's too fast! Be careful!

274
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:53,083
[JULIA] Hmph!
That was a mistake.

275
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:05,500
[CATHY screams]

276
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:15,791
[CATHY groans]

277
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:20,500
[JULIA] Normally, a Quattro Full
Acceleration can't be evaded.

278
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:24,791
Unfortunately, it seems you
forgot my division waves.

279
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:26,416
[CATHY]
Her Volt Weapons?

280
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,583
You see, the two Stigma
Satellite Systems

281
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:30,541
I use are
extraordinarily unique.

282
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:33,875
They can instantaneously
release Mach-3 Sonic Waves

283
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:36,083
in every possible direction.

284
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:37,458
On the other hand,

285
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:40,458
a Quattro Full Acceleration
can only achieve Mach-2.

286
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,833
After completely filling
the surrounding space

287
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:46,416
with Sonic Waves...
Evasion's unnecessary.

288
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,791
I am never
going to give up!

289
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:55,125
[ELIZABETH] From this point
forward, we have one goal.

290
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:59,125
And that is to return Amelia
and the others back to normal.

291
00:16:59,208 --> 00:16:59,750
[AMELIA] No.

292
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:01,250
[group gasps]

293
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:03,125
[AMELIA] I am the one who
decided to put this in my body.

294
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:04,833
And as a result of my decision,

295
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:06,916
I alone have to deal
with the consequences

296
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,875
of what's going to happen to me.

297
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:13,458
Even though there is no
saving me from my fate,

298
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:16,333
I can still expose everything
that's happening at this lab!

299
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:20,625
So don't fight for me, fight
for the truth to be revealed!

300
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,791
Let's do it then.

301
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:28,416
[CHARLES] Hold it.
Have you all lost your minds?

302
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:39,750
[AMELIA snarls]

303
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:46,541
Well, well,
Charles Bonaparte.

304
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,333
Do any of you realize
what it is you're doing

305
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:54,083
or are you
all just idiots?

306
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:55,250
[ELIZABETH] You need
to know the truth

307
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:56,708
about what's happening here.

308
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:59,000
Oh, you have got to be
kidding me with this!

309
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:00,541
When the world comes
to an end because

310

I'm standing here listening
to your crap story.

311

Who's gonna be
responsible then? Tell me!

312
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:10,625
I'm begging you, Charles,
please do not stand in our way.

313
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:12,500
If you interfere with
what she's trying to do,

314
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:14,791
I promise that you
will regret it forever.

315
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:18,166
[CHARLES] You wanna know
what I regret, Elizabeth?

316
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:20,916
I regret my stupidity
for being slightly upset

317
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,416
over eliminating one of
these pathetic imitations!

318
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,416
If it were up to me,
I would kill all of them!

319
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:30,291
Aahh!

320
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:31,791
Aaaaahhh!

321
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:33,875
Amelia, please don't do this!

322
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:37,250
[AMELIA yells]

323
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:42,333
[AMELIA]
I'll kill you.

324
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:47,791
I promise you I will!
With my own two hands!

325
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:49,666
[AMELIA yells]

326
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:56,500
I've had enough of
you for one day.

327
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:58,208
Miss Imitation.

328
00:18:58,291 --> 00:18:59,958
[CHARLES]
Stay back!

329
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:02,666
If you take one more step...

330
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,666
...I will dispose of her.

331
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:07,291
Like the filthy
traitor that she is!

332
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:13,041
[AMELIA]
Damn you.

333
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:17,208
You'll pay for this.
For all of it.

334
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
--No! That's her Nova Form!
--Amelia!

335
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:27,000
[AMELIA grunts and screams]

336
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,125
[ELIZABETH]
Amelia, stop!

337
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:32,000
You're the one who said your
goal was to expose the lab.

338
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:33,875
To do whatever it takes
to show the world

339
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:35,500
what has been done to
your friends because

340
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:38,125
a few members of the
leadership have inflated egos!

341
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:40,500
If you do this,
they may never be exposed!

342
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:42,583
[AMELIA gasps]

343
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:45,416
Inflated egos of
the leadership?

344
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,666
[YOUNG CHARLES]
So now what?

345
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:49,541
You're going to play the
villain like that again?

346
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:52,541
[SPENCER] Sometimes a villain
is what the world needs.

347
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:54,833
And if becoming a villain
will save the lives

348
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:56,750
of countless innocents,

349
00:19:56,833 --> 00:20:01,416
then it's a part I am
more than happy to play.

350
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,625
Only darkness can
defeat darkness, Charles.

351
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:06,583
You understand?

352
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:09,625
Of course, father.

353
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:12,083
[CHARLES]
You're wrong.

354
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:13,958
You can drag the leadership
through the mud

355
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:16,416
and say whatever
the hell you want.

356
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,208
But you have no idea what
that small group of people

357
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:21,416
have sacrificed in order
to preserve humanity

358
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,791
and protect the future
generations of the world.

359
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:25,208
[ELIZABETH sighs]

360
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:29,083
[ELIZABETH]
Amelia, you have to go.

361
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:30,958
Satellizer, she's
going to need help.

362
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:32,500
[SATELLIZER] Uh?!

363
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:34,166
[ELIZABETH] I ask that you go
with her and keep her safe.

364
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,625
[SATELLIZER] You ask?

365
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:37,333
No, I order you to go.

366
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:39,500
As your superior senior student.

367
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:42,083
Protect Amelia at all costs.

368
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:43,916
[SATELLIZER]
Yes, ma'am.

369
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,458
Whatever you need.

370
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:47,375
[ELIZABETH] You too, Rana.
Go with them.

371
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:49,416
I am at your command.

372
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:54,833
[ELIZABETH]
Amelia... hurry up.

373
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:56,208
[AMELIA] Mm.

374
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:02,500
[ELIZABETH] I'm counting
on you. Good luck.

375
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:05,375
[CHARLES] Look at you,
acting all cool!

376
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:07,458
It seems that you've
kept your reputation

377
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:09,125
for being the boss lady intact.

378
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:11,291
But you're not actually
stupid enough to think

379
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:13,708
you can take me down, are you?

380
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:21,708
[ELIZABETH] Who said anything
about taking you down, Charles?

381
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:27,875
[ELIZABETH] All I need
to do is keep you busy!

382
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:38,375
[AMELIA]
Doctor Ohara!

383
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:42,041
I will get a hold of your
experiment logs and expose you!

384
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:43,666
And then...

385
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:42,958
[CHIFFON]
I mean after all...

386
00:23:43,041 --> 00:23:45,916
I don't think I'll even
need to get serious.

387
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,375
[ELIZABETH] We will win
even if it kills us!

388
00:23:48,458 --> 00:23:50,875
[SATELLIZER] Next time.
True Pandora.
