[AMELIA] Answer me,
Doctor Ohara.

2
00:01:51,791 --> 00:01:54,041
What are these things?

3
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:56,208
[OHARA] You remember learning
about Maria Lancelot,

4
00:01:56,291 --> 00:01:57,958
the predecessor of the Pandora.

5
00:01:58,041 --> 00:01:59,875
I know you've heard of her.

6
00:01:59,958 --> 00:02:01,750
[AMELIA]
What are you saying?

7
00:02:01,833 --> 00:02:03,416
These things are Maria?

8
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,500
[OHARA] Technically,
they're mass-produced clones

9
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:08,000
of Maria Lancelot
that I created.

10
00:02:08,083 --> 00:02:10,458
I call them Type-Maria Pandora.

11
00:02:10,541 --> 00:02:12,791
Why would you do
something like this?

12
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:14,708
Once I have perfected
the Type Maria,

13
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:16,083
we won't need you girls anymore.

14
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:17,958
The Original Pandora
will no longer have to

15
00:02:18,041 --> 00:02:20,333
sacrifice themselves either.

16
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:23,958
[AMELIA] If you had this
project in the works,

17
00:02:24,041 --> 00:02:27,583
then why did Chevalier
need to create E-Pandora?

18
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:29,041
[OHARA laughs]

19
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:32,541
[OHARA] This project is
entirely of my own design.

20
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:36,041
None of these experiments had
the approval of Chevalier.

[AMELIA]
So these messed-up lab rats

the whole time?

23
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:41,250
What about us?!

24
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:45,000
Didn't we E-Pandora
mean anything to you?

All those things you said.

I trusted you.

29

But everything you've ever
told me is probably just a lie.

30

Jina and Rattle wasted their
lives for your sick vision!

31

None of your efforts
were in vain.

32
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:03,833
Some sacrifices were necessary

33
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:06,000
for the sake of
humanity's future.

what I've gone through.

43
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:31,208
I'm completely aware of the
atrocities I've committed

44
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:33,916
and the burden that
will be mine to bear.

But even so, I must
accomplish my goal.
