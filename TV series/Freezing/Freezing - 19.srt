you doing, Satella?

Move!

00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,166
[KAZUYA] No matter what
scars you've left on her.

And no matter what pain
she carries because of you.

00:00:53,875 --> 00:00:56,708
I respect her for the person
that she's become!

00:00:56,791 --> 00:01:00,000
Yes! I love her
and I always will!

No, Luis.

Kazuya is more than my Limiter.

00:01:19,958 --> 00:01:22,208
He showed me how to live again!

00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:24,708
Thanks to you, I avoided
people for years.

17

I wouldn't let anyone get close.

18
00:01:26,583 --> 00:01:29,583
But Kazuya taught me to trust.
He brought me out of my shell.

19
00:01:29,666 --> 00:01:31,958
He means everything to me!

20
00:01:32,041 --> 00:01:35,125
I'll protect Kazuya against
anything that threatens him.

21
00:01:35,208 --> 00:01:37,125
I'll defend him.

Stop being an idiot
or I'll make sure

27

Father won't listen to
what you have to say.

28

Now. Be a good little toy and
do as you're told, Satella.

You don't have to do
what he tells you.

There's the big sister I know.

The one who obeys my every whim.

32
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:44,791
I'll go easy on you
for disobeying me

33

for his disrespect.

You don't stand a snowball's

I told you, she's one of

And I told you
something, Luis.

I will protect Kazuya against
anything that threatens him!

Just punish her.

[HOLLY] Aaahh!

I was imagining things!

Aaahh!

00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:01,291
But I knew, even though
I refused to admit it!

49
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:03,000
I knew.

50
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:07,541
There has always been someone
else in Luis' life. You!

51

She your
girlfriend?

[LUIS]
No, just my half-sister.

58
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:33,041

you mean to him.

But I never would have guessed

she'd turn out to be
Luis' own half-sister!

If it weren't for you,
he'd love me!

[LUIS] Why? Why does it
have to be this way?

just another tramp?

I'm the eldest son of
the El Bridget family!

You really think I could have
feelings for someone like you?

You're nothing more than a
temporary plaything to me!

poor substitute for my sister!

I thought you just said
I could have you.

If that's the case
then keep serving

you always have.

Even though you'll never be
as satisfying as she is.

it felt being told

that I'd never
measure up to you?

this entire time.

But his mind and his heart were
always on you, "Big Sister!"

Tell me!

91

Why does it always
have to be you?

Can't it be me for once?

93

to talk her to death.

starting to annoy me.

You don't honestly think you can
beat Holly in a fight, do you?

98
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:44,375
Would you like
to bet on it?

99

[LUIS] I can only say you're
being ridiculous so many times.

But sure, why not?

101
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:50,916
I don't think you have
any hope of winning.

102
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,333
But, if by chance you do
manage to defeat Holly,

103
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:56,416
I'll speak to Father for you.

104

[LUIS] Bet you didn't
see that coming!

Switching from a Double
to a Triple Acceleration

112
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,416
like that is something Holly
mastered some time ago.

That's why it looked like
she changed places.

I have to admit,

you've got an advantage
over me with that move.

you about this.

You've seen what
Holly can do

so why not stop this nonsense?

Perhaps I'll be merciful and

ever happened.

[SATELLIZER] No.

Because I've got
you, Kazuya.

Together we can

You've shown me that I can be
a lot more than Luis' puppet.

Did you hear that,

have any more control over me!
