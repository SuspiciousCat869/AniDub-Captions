1
00:00:26,833 --> 00:00:28,916
Go in peace, child.

2
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,541
May the goddess Kunlun
be ever at your side

3
00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:34,916
to guide and protect you.

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,166
Look thou, Rana,

5
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:39,125
and find he who shall
guide your destiny,

6
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:42,041
the young man to
whom you are fated...

7
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:44,458
Now arise!

8
00:00:44,541 --> 00:00:47,166
Yes... Patriarch.

9
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,208
This is your standard Nova.

10
00:02:26,291 --> 00:02:28,625
As you already know,
when they materialize here

11
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:30,625
from the dimension
of their origin,

12
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:32,750
all living things
within a certain range

13
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:34,958
are forcibly restrained.

14
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:39,500
In other words... their
appearance causes a Freezing.

15
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:44,208
And that is when a Limiter
must play his part...

16
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:47,333
It is his duty to neutralize
the Nova's Freezing area,

17
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:51,291
and create a space within which
his Pandora can kill her foe.

18
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:54,708
"Causes a Freezing." Hm...

19
00:02:56,958 --> 00:03:00,375
Casting an omnidirectional
Freezing is impossible...!

20
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:03,958
That little unbaptized freak has
the same abilities as a Nova?!

21
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:05,166
Huh?

22
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:11,583
How'd he do it...?

23
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:16,666
Wait, what...?!

24
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:17,875
You don't know how?!

25
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:20,875
Uh... yeah... No clue.

26
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:21,958
So that's your answer?

27
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:23,250
Not a clue...?!

28
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:24,958
I'm sorry, but
that's just weird...

29
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:26,291
You've never been baptized

30
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:29,583
and you cast a Freezing
outta nowhere like that?!

31
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:31,041
That is kinda weird, huh,

32
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:33,416
Satellizer was in trouble
and the Freezing happened

33
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,750
before I knew what was going on.

34
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:37,958
I know it doesn't make sense.

35
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:42,000
You weren't thinking about it...

36
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:43,791
Okay. Well...?

37
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:46,041
What'd "Satellizer"
have to say about it?

38
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:47,250
Nothing yet...

39
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:48,958
I haven't really seen
her since the fight.

40
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:50,541
Huh...?!

41
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:52,333
You put your life on the line
to save her butt that night...

42
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:54,875
And you haven't even gotten
a lousy "Thank you"?!

43
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:56,833
Hey, it's fine.

44
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:57,666
See...?

45
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,458
What've we been telling you?

46
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:02,375
That Satellizer is nothing
but bad news, my friend...

47
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:04,208
She's hot, I'm not
gonna lie to you...

48
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:05,583
Hey, I totally understand

49
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:08,666
how you could get sucked
in by a beauty like that.

50
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,500
Thanks, but what
are you talking about?

51
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:12,791
Roses are beautiful, too--

52
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:14,500
doesn't mean the
thorns don't hurt.

53
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:16,875
Uh-huh--and she's got
the biggest thorns of all...

54
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:19,500
One little prick
and you're done for.

55
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,083
Uh...!

56
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,708
What a surprise.
Good afternoon, ma'am...!

57
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:30,000
It's funny, we were just
talking about your beauty,

58
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:31,000
and now you're, here!

59
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:32,833
Yeah...! Yeah,
we certainly were!

60
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:35,208
All the boys in our class are
absolutely smitten with you!

61
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:37,541
It's embarrassing
how they carry on!

62
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:40,333
So Kazuya... listen.

63
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:42,333
Ma'am?

64
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:45,291
I wish to speak
with you in private...

65
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:46,958
Follow me.

66
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:50,166
Yeah...! Okay!

67
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,666
Uh... what was that all about?

68
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,416
It's called being whipped.

69
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:01,625
So, uh... why're we here?

70
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:20,958
I knew it...

71
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:21,791
Huh?

72
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:22,750
You're all right.

73
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:25,000
I had a feeling you were...

74
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:28,250
Even when... you touch me...

75
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:30,416
...it doesn't make me feel bad.

76
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:35,916
That's never happened
before... Never.

77
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,125
M-Me, too...!

78
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:42,375
Ever since the very
first moment I looked at you,

79
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:44,416
well, it feels like
I've been dreaming.

80
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:48,666
No... I keep thinking you're...!

81
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:54,458
It's just that I've never
known this feeling before...

82
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:57,291
When I try explaining
it, the words--

83
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:02,208
You can cast
Freezing areas, right?

84
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:04,750
You can, can't you.

85
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:07,166
Even without the Ereinbar Set.

86
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,458
Yeah... I guess
you could say that...

87
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:11,250
But I've tried it a couple
of times since then

88
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:12,666
and I haven't had any luck...

89
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,791
Starting to think it
was a one-time thing.

90
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,375
I've decided.

91
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:19,916
Decided what?

92
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,250
I'll do it... I hereby agree to
make you my Limiter, Kazuya!

93
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:27,916
Are... you sure you wanna?

94
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,791
Yes... But I can't
baptize you, okay...?

95
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:34,041
As long as you don't
mind that... then I...

96
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:37,000
Of course I don't mind!

97
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:42,750
Thank you, Kazuya...
You're very kind.

98
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:44,708
Thank you.

99
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:51,916
This is the West
Genetics Academy...?

100
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:56,208
Oh... wow, how
wondrous this place is!

101
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:57,875
Here, so far from home...

102
00:06:57,958 --> 00:07:00,416
Kunlun shall surely
lead me to him...!

103
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,041
The man who is my destiny!

104
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:11,125
It may not be official,
but it's enough for me.

105
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:14,125
Burgers are okay, right?

106
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:16,250
Oh... sure.

107
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:18,875
Hold on...

108
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:20,833
She bought all those for me?

109
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:23,916
There's no way
I can eat all this...

110
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:26,125
You're not eating.

111
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:28,250
Thank you for the food...!

112
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:30,000
I just hope you brought enough.

113
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:34,000
Kazuya... well...
are you busy tonight?

114
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:37,208
Tonight...?
Well, not really, no.

115
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:40,208
Then... Would you like to...

116
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:42,291
I'm listening.

117
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:43,791
Never mind.

118
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:45,708
Oh.

119
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:46,541
Damn it!

120
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:48,333
Huh?

121
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:49,833
I would be honored,

122
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:52,125
if you would come up
to my room tonight!

123
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:53,750
You... want me to
come to your room?

124
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:55,916
Exactly! You'll do it, right?

125
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,791
Uh... yes, ma'am...

126
00:07:57,875 --> 00:08:00,458
I'll do whatever you want.

127
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:03,583
It's neat that she invited
me to her room, but...

128
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:06,708
I don't get why she
seemed so nervous about it?

129
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:10,583
This campus is enormous...

130
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:13,291
How long have
I been walking now...?

131
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,791
Huh...? Who's that girl...?

132
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:21,000
And what is that outfit about?

133
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:27,833
At long last I have
discovered somebody else!

134
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:30,416
Uh... congrats...?

135
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,875
Oh, you're a
transfer student...?

136
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:36,583
Guess that's why she's
not in a school uniform...

137
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:39,208
Your campus is
impossibly vast...!

138
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:40,541
I was afraid I would be doomed

139
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:43,000
to wander its paths for
the remainder of my days.

140
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:46,708
I don't think
it's as big as that.

141
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:48,291
You'll find the
principal in there.

142
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:51,416
Yes! Many thanks
for guiding my way!

143
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,916
You are very kind!

144
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,750
You truly are a
gentleman, are you not?

145
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:57,166
Just helping out...

146
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,208
It was nothing--really.

147
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:02,791
How the goddess smiles
upon me this day...!

148
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,708
All thanks be to Kunlun
for granting me such kismet!

149
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,875
Farewell!

150
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:08,666
Who's Kunlun...?

151
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:12,500
Crap...! It's almost time
for me to meet Satellizer!

152
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:13,750
What are you worked up about?

153
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:15,333
Huh?

154
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:16,541
Whaaat...?!

155
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:18,916
The Untouchable Queen
actually said that?!

156
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
She wants to pair up
without a proper baptism?!

157
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:22,916
Mhmm.

158
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,166
Woah...!

159
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,041
Without the Stigmata,
how are you even a pair?

160
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:27,458
There won't be any proof!

161
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:29,458
Why doesn't she
want to make it official?

162
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:33,083
If you ask me, I think she's
just using you for your power!

163
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:34,625
I'm with Hiiragi on this one.

164
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,833
If Satellizer doesn't
want to do right by you,

165
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:38,250
you might as well turn her down.

166
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:40,375
You deserve better than that.

167
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:42,958
You've got it all wrong, guys!

168
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,791
She even asked me
up to her room--

169
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,500
that's where I'm headed now.

170
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:48,666
You're going to her room?!

171
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:49,625
For real?

172
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:51,416
You actually got a room invite?!

173
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,166
From her?!

174
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,208
What's the big deal?

175
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:54,791
When a Pandora
chooses her Limiter,

176
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:56,458
she invites him to her room!

177
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:57,916
It's like tradition.

178
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,458
The guys certainly approve.

179
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:00,458
Why is that?

180
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:01,625
You know...!

181
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:02,916
If you're gonna work as a team,

182
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,166
you have to get nice
and close to your Pandora.

183
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,750
The "big sisters"
have to make sure

184
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:09,333
the "little brothers'"
needs are taken care of.

185
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:14,916
I still remember my first
room invite with Ganessa...

186
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,208
kinda...

187
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:19,791
I might have gotten
liquored up first...

188
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:22,041
I was out like a
light until morning.

189
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:23,500
Wow.

190
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:24,458
Was it good for her?

191
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:25,875
Official or not,

192
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,291
at least the Untouchable Queen
gave you a room invite.

193
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:29,666
That's something, right?

194
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,708
Still... without a baptism...

195
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:35,500
You know it's bad
news--right, Kazuya?

196
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:38,125
C'mon, you guys...

197
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:40,458
I would be honored,

198
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:43,125
if you would come up
to my room tonight!

199
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:45,208
Satellizer doesn't
seem like she'd be

200
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:47,625
into that kind of thing,
tradition or not.

201
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:50,208
Is she forcing
herself to do this?

202
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:52,333
Maybe he'd like
this one on me...

203
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:55,958
Unless... this one
is more his style...

204
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,750
I'd like you to consider
selecting me to be your Limiter.

205
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:02,125
Think things over for a sec.

206
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:03,916
Are you sure you wanna do this?

207
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
You can still back out.

208
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:06,458
Nothing's set in stone.

209
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:09,666
I'm going inside...
I'm sure it'll be just fine...!

210
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,125
See ya later!

211
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:18,375
You should watch where
you're going, first-year.

212
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:19,375
You're right...

213
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:20,625
I'll be more
careful next time...

214
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:22,458
Please excuse me...

215
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:23,333
Hold on.

216
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,500
Um, I'm kinda in a hurry.

217
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:27,083
Hey, you're that kid...

218
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:28,375
Yeah, you're the
weird little boy

219
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:30,791
who keeps begging to
be Satellizer's Limiter.

220
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:33,458
Ah--so you're the new guy.

221
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:36,583
Well... Not much to look at...

222
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:38,500
So... Am I to believe
that "Her Highness"

223
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:40,791
has consented to
be paired with you?

224
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:42,250
Oh, please no!

225
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:43,958
Say "no"--say "no"!

226
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:46,166
Yeah... I guess...

227
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:48,000
Wrong answer...!

228
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:51,041
That's just marvelous,
isn't it, girls?

229
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:52,125
Y'know what...?

230
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:53,750
Since we're all here...

231
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:56,708
How about we help you
celebrate your big night?

232
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:58,000
Huh?

233
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,916
You must be tired
after your trip.

234
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,708
Sleep well tonight,
you've a busy day tomorrow.

235
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:05,750
And if there's anything
about life at this school

236
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:08,541
you don't understand, please
don't hesitate to ask me.

237
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:09,625
Okay, Rana?

238
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:10,500
Thank you!

239
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:12,041
That is very kind, Miss Chiffon!

240
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:13,625
As principal of West Genetics,

241
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:17,041
please allow me to extend
my thanks to your patriarch...

242
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:18,208
His decision to send you

243
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:21,125
to us was a generous
one, Rana Linchen...

244
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,250
You are welcome here.

245
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:35,500
Stop picking on him!

246
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:36,833
What did you say?

247
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:38,958
The three of you ganging
up on him isn't very fair.

248
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:40,291
Well, look at that...

249
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:43,041
An underclassman mouthing
off to her seniors...

250
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:45,208
I'm just saying, he's
not looking for trouble!

251
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:48,041
Au contraire--he brought
this upon himself!.

252
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:50,791
Isn't that right!

253
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,333
Do I know you...? Who are you?

254
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:54,750
Really...?

255
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:56,291
You're saying you don't
know who the three of us are?

256
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:57,375
No. Why?

257
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:59,291
Audrey Duval, at your service...

258
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:02,625
But most know me as
"The Slice-and-Dice Maiden."

259
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:04,416
My name is Aika Takeuchi, aka...

260
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,291
"Intoxicating Bondage."

261
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:09,708
I'm "Twin Fang" Tris McKenzie...

262
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:11,708
Forget my name
and I'll kick your ass...

263
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,416
Are we clear on that?

264
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,916
I know these girls...

265
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,416
they all lost to Satellizer
in the most recent Carnival.

266
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:22,041
Wait, so then
that's why you're--?

267
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:27,291
Why are you doing this?!

268
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:28,958
Isn't it obvious...?

269
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:32,208
You kids could use
some... discipline!

270
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,833
Sometimes you
first-years get too big

271
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:42,208
for your britches and
forget your proper place...

272
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:45,250
We consider it our
duty to remind you.

273
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:46,333
Fine, I'm reminded!

274
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:48,666
I think I'll play
with you first...

275
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,750
You really shouldn't
take too long.

276
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:53,208
I don't care if you
are all upperclassmen...!

277
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:54,541
If you're looking for a fight,

278
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:57,083
I'd be more than
happy to oblige!

279
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:58,291
You little bitch...!

280
00:13:58,375 --> 00:13:59,791
What are you doing,
are you crazy?

281
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:01,500
Just walk away!

282
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:03,041
Too late for that, kid...

283
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:05,666
You've got to pay
for your disrespect.

284
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:07,000
That's right...

285
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:08,958
Discipline's not gonna cut it...

286
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:11,833
I think we better
just kill this one!

287
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:23,708
Nice try, but
you're way too slow!

288
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:31,291
Say goodbye...
you mouthy little brat!

289
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:42,208
Hiiragi... Hiiragi...?
Hiiragiiiiiiii!

290
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:44,500
I'm... gonna go get a teacher.

291
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,375
You're not going
anywhere, blondie...

292
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:48,208
I really don't
think that snitching

293
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:50,625
is very manly behavior, do you?

294
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:53,666
You're a naughty
little boy, aren't you...?

295
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,250
I guess I'm gonna
have to break you in.

296
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:56,666
It's for your own good.

297
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:59,083
I think "discipline"
is the preferred term.

298
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:01,916
Yeah... But in the end
the result is the same.

299
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,250
As long as I can make
you bleed a little bit,

300
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:06,041
that's good enough for me!

301
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:11,166
This is most strange...!

302
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,708
No matter how long I search,

303
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:16,000
the girls' dormitory
continues to elude me...!

304
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:23,791
How are you
doing down there...?!

305
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:25,041
Tell me how much you enjoy it

306
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,458
and maybe I'll
leave you something!

307
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:28,958
Oh dear...

308
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:31,833
It seems like Takeuchi has
slid into her cruel ways again.

309
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:34,166
Leave him alone...!

310
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:35,833
As if...

311
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:37,833
Who gave you permission
to talk, first-year?

312
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:39,958
Honestly...

313
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:42,166
They're just letting anyone in.

314
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:46,250
Let my friends go.

315
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:50,916
Let them go...!

316
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,583
Try not to do too much permanent
damage to 'em, ladies...

317
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:54,583
What the hell...?

318
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:57,041
What are you
mumbling about, kid?

319
00:15:57,125 --> 00:16:00,291
Let them go or you'll regret it!

320
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:01,541
Oh!

321
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:04,041
You are quite the
edifice, girls' dormitory!

322
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:05,916
Let them go...?

323
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,375
You have got a lot of
nerve for a first-year.

324
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:09,916
Do you really think
you can treat my friends

325
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,416
like that and
get away with it...?

326
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:17,208
I'm not letting you...
hurt them... anymore!

327
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:23,041
Kunlun's Tears are vibrating...!

328
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:25,041
This sensation--!

329
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:28,541
No... I can't move anything!

330
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:30,250
Why did they all just stop...?

331
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:31,791
Oh no, don't tell me...!

332
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:33,291
Not again...

333
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:37,000
Get that chain...

334
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:38,791
...off of my friend...!

335
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:48,750
Frozen with no set...

336
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:49,916
Who are you?!

337
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,125
Are you telling me...

338
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:52,750
...that the Untouchable
Queen is gonna make

339
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:54,708
this first-year her Limiter?

340
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:57,500
This strong of a boy paired
with a Pandora like her...?

341
00:16:57,583 --> 00:17:01,291
I'm sorry... but I don't
like the sound of that!

342
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:03,583
No...! Don't do it!

343
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:05,416
Quiet down, I'm not killing him,

344
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,541
all I'm going to do is
carve him out a little memento,

345
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:10,875
that way the next time he
thinks of sticking his nose in

346
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:13,291
where it doesn't belong
and Freezing his betters,

347
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:15,541
he'll remember the
consequences and mind...

348
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:18,833
...his own business!

349
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:20,875
Hey, where the hell
did she come from?!

350
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:22,958
Do pardon the question, miss,

351
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:25,333
but what are your
intentions towards him?

352
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:26,583
What the...?!

353
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:28,250
Why do you talk like that?!

354
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:31,625
Know this: I will not let you
harm one hair upon his head.

355
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:35,500
Kunlun's holy tears spoke to me
the moment I laid eyes upon him.

356
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:37,666
The boy is mine, and I am his.

357
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:40,416
What kind of
new age crap is that?!

358
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,875
Damn, she's strong!

359
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:42,916
Hey, you...!

360
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,083
Can't they count
where you're from?!

361
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:45,583
You're up against
three of us, ya know!

362
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:48,375
You don't actually think
you can beat us, do you?!

363
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:52,958
You little--!

364
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:02,250
You want tears,
I'll give 'em to ya!

365
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:16,416
We can fight more,
if it pleases you.

366
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:19,541
She's... unreal!

367
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:31,625
Yeah... This is the one...
It'll be perfect.

368
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:37,041
It's about time...!

369
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:38,500
How long did you intend
to keep me waiting?

370
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:39,791
Uh... sorry...

371
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:42,000
I know it's
pretty late, ma'am...

372
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:44,750
So how is he?!

373
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:46,375
He's been out since it happened.

374
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,750
They moved him to the infirmary.

375
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:53,333
Oh-- and she's the
one who saved him.

376
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:54,708
Is he awake?!

377
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:57,041
So you are a
schoolmate of Kazuya's...?

378
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:58,791
They are saying he'll be fine...

379
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:00,416
Perhaps you would
like to wait with me,

380
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,666
my hope is that
he will be allowed 

381
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,291
to have visitors quite soon.

382
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,125
Wait with you...?

383
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:08,291
You mean to say...
you're a student?

384
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:10,708
Well, I have not yet been
enrolled into your academy...

385
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:13,250
if that is what you mean.

386
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:14,833
But I will be soon.

387
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:17,458
I transfer into West Genetics
first thing in the morning...

388
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:19,916
My name is Rana Linchen, miss...

389
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,875
I am most happy to meet you!

390
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:23,958
You're a transfer?

391
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:27,625
Oh, Rana--hey... you, uh,
mind if I borrow you for a sec?

392
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,125
Sec?

393
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:31,375
Hiiragi said she wants to
thank you for saving her, too.

394
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:33,083
I am waiting to see Kazuya...!

395
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:34,375
This comes first, okay?

396
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:36,791
Just trust me on this...!

397
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,916
Um...!

398
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,791
Goodness... Can I help you?

399
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:44,875
Kazuya Aoi... How is he?

400
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:47,250
Kazuya...? You sound
worried about him.

401
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:48,333
No--not at all...

402
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:50,333
Well, maybe a little.

403
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:52,250
That boy... I tried to tell him

404
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:55,458
that he's pushing
his body way too hard.

405
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:56,833
It's nothing fatal.

406
00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:58,416
He's just exhausted.

407
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,625
Not that you're
worried, of course.

408
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:04,416
Well? Get in there already.

409
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,458
You came to see him, right...?

410
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:09,208
He needs someone by his side.

411
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:16,875
Oh, Kazuya...

412
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:26,000
So... you're a
transfer student, huh?

413
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:27,625
Our patriarch ordered
me to come here

414
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:30,541
that I may discover
the man of my destiny.

415
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:33,000
Wait--"the man of your destiny"?

416
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:33,916
Truly...!

417
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,666
That is the fate of all women

418
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,958
who carry Kunlun's
Tears upon them.

419
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:41,000
Behold--the blessed
tears of the goddess.

420
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:42,041
Stigmata?!

421
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:43,666
Yeah, but--six?!

422
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:47,375
I kinda figured as much,
with how crazy strong you are.

423
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:48,833
Hey, Rana...

424
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:50,916
You were a Pandora back in
your hometown, weren't you?

425
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,208
Pandora...?

426
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:54,333
I do not know that word.

427
00:20:58,125 --> 00:20:59,458
You speak the truth?!

428
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:01,958
Kunlun has wept on a great
many girls at this school,

429
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:03,291
from what you say!

430
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:05,208
This is serendipitous!

431
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:08,750
Wait, so... by man of destiny,
you mean a Limiter, don't you?

432
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:09,916
You'll get one, no problem--

433
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,208
there are boys
all over the place!

434
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:14,000
But I have...

435
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:17,500
I found my man of destiny
my very first day here!

436
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:21,000
He is Kazuya Aoi...

437
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:22,750
Fate has doubtless
brought us together.

438
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:24,958
He is my soul mate--he
and none other.

439
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:27,041
That might not be
such a good idea.

440
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:29,000
Yeah, he's... off the market.

441
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:30,708
What do you mean by that?

442
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:33,208
Well... Satellizer,
that girl you just met...?

443
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:36,000
She called dibs on him...
So you're too late.

444
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:42,291
So... The Untouchable Queen
has finally surrendered

445
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:44,666
to the touch of another person.

446
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:48,250
And we still don't know
what other sorts of tricks

447
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:51,916
that first-year boy might have
hidden up his sleeve, do we?

448
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,708
That's all well and good,

449
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:56,125
but I'm more interested
in that foreign girl

450
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:58,708
who seems to have
appeared out of thin air.

451
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:08,333
Suffice to say... things
are getting interesting.

452
00:23:41,041 --> 00:23:42,000
After I finish beating you...

453
00:23:42,083 --> 00:23:43,375
That's right--dance,
little puppets.

454
00:23:43,458 --> 00:23:44,583
...you'll never interfere
with us again.

455
00:23:44,666 --> 00:23:46,416
After <i>I</i> finish beating <i>you,</i>

456
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,500
you will remove
yourself from Kazuya!

457
00:23:48,583 --> 00:23:50,541
Next time: "Machination."
