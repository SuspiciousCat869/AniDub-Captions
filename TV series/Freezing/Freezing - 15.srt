00:00:30,041 --> 00:00:32,916
[OHARA] Beginning today, I ask
for the sincere cooperation

2
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,583
of all Original Pandora to
ensure the program's success.

[gasps and whispers]

00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,416
[OHARA]
This is the Mark IV.

5
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,875
They went ahead and
made another one?

6
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:54,083
It is comprised of
self-replicating nanomachines

7
00:00:54,166 --> 00:00:55,958
and is installed
with data collected

8
00:00:56,041 --> 00:00:58,208
from the Original Pandora.

9
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:00,583
Original Pandora data?

10
00:01:00,666 --> 00:01:03,791
[OHARA] We will begin with its
distribution to the E-Pandora.

11
00:01:03,875 --> 00:01:06,041
When the Mark IV
goes into effect,

12
00:01:06,125 --> 00:01:08,166
their stigmata
will be activated,

13
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:11,041
raising their abilities to
a level that is comparable

14
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:12,625
to the Original Pandora.

15
00:01:12,708 --> 00:01:13,958
[FEMALE CROWD] Ooh!

[ROXANNE]
About the Mark IV.

18
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:05,375
If they already had
it up their sleeve,

19
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:07,250
why wasn't it used
for the mock battles?

20
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:10,416
That might've prevented 'em
from being so one-sided.

[CHIFFON]
Speaking of the Mark IV.

24
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:41,291
I thought Chevalier
hadn't approved it.

25
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:42,708
Not yet, anyway.

26
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:43,416
[ROXANNE] Huh?

27
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,375
[CATHY]
It is weird.

28
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:48,000
Even if our data was collected
during our physicals,

29
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:50,250
wouldn't it most likely
still take a lot of time

30
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:51,583
to install the information?

31
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:54,458
Hey there! If it's not
the Godspeed of the East.

32
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:55,875
[ELIZABETH]
Think about it.

33
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:58,333
Grafting stigmata onto normal
girls is painful enough.

34
00:03:58,416 --> 00:03:59,666
[CHIFFON, ROXANNE, and CATHY]
Huh?

35
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,041
But they're taking
things further

36
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:04,000
by activating the stigmata
with nanomachines.

37
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:05,666
And that means...

38
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,875
...before the E-Pandora
are even accustomed

39
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:09,375
to the artificial stigmata,

40
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:12,708
they're going to increase
their abilities to our level.

41
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:17,916
How long before their
bodies break down?

42
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,625
That's a good
question, Mably.

43
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:21,125
There's definitely
something fishy

44
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:22,541
with this E-Pandora business.

45
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:24,208
[CHARLES] Quit being
so paranoid about stuff

46
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:26,291
you have no say in, Zombie Girl.

47
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:27,666
Who the hell said that?

48
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,208
My name's "Roxanne
the Immortal,"

49
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:31,458

and the Maverick of Walpurgis!

52
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:40,333
You know that
as a Pandora,

53
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:42,875
it is our duty to obey
orders without question.

54
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:44,125
You'd better not forget that.

55

Hopefully you can understand
where I'm coming from.

Well, Miss Unparalleled Monster?

61
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:02,041
Yo Monster, are you
even listening?

[CHIFFON sighs]

63
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:07,000
[CHIFFON] You girls
are so heartless.

I don't know why you insist
on calling me a monster.

Believe it or not.

I happen to think that
I'm kind of pretty!

[GIRLS] Uh?

Heh. Talk about
changing the subject!

What do you think you're doing?

72
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:32,333
Yeah, these are
pretty impressive.

73

I mean, seriously,
at least double D's, right?

None of your

We definitely won't be short on
entertainment with this bunch!

Yeah, but Don't let
the fun times fool you,

they're also going
to have your back

78

if things get hairy in battle.

79
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:46,250

and get along!

a good point, guys.

our bosses' orders,

what with the fate of mankind
resting on our shoulders.

87
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,625
And we've basically
already given up any shot

88
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:05,125
at a normal life.

89
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:07,458
Not the easiest decision,
considering we're all hotties.

[ROXANNE] Whatever.

94

I guess we're all kinda victims,
one way or another.

She wanted to speak with you.

101
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:11,791
[OHARA] Chevalier has already
ordered use of the Mark IV.

102
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:14,208
We can't backtrack now.

103
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:16,083
Oh, That's not
why I'm here.

There's actually
something else on my mind

105

I was hoping to ask you.

[OHARA] All right then,
out with it.

107
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:26,000
About the
presentation earlier.

108
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:30,375
Is the Mark IV an upgraded
version of the Mark III?

109
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:31,958
[OHARA sighs]

110
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:33,333
[OHARA] Yes.

111
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:36,375
But I don't understand!
The Mark III was a failure!

112
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:47,833
[AMELIA groans]

113
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:53,083
[OHARA] It was, and
I'm reminded of that fact

114
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:56,000
every time I look at your hair.

115
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:01,125
But unlike the Mark III,

116
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:03,833
the Mark IV was developed
with the application

117
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:06,583
of the Original Pandora's
data in mind.

118
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:09,208
It boasts far greater
stability without bearing

119
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:11,000
any risk of side effects.

120
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:16,458
The Mark IV is head and
shoulders above its predecessor.

121
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:20,750
So you're sure...
that it'll be okay?

Whether it's okay or not...

...isn't for you to decide!

126

Surely you knew what
you were getting into.

127

The contract that you
signed says it all.

You will obey any orders
regarding the E-Pandora project!

129

Don't play dumb and act
like you don't know the truth.

You can't be serious.

We don't even have the right
to prevent our own deaths?

That's correct.

Even if the Mark IV were to
kill one or two E-Pandora...

Tying with me...
is an impressive feat!

I am... equally
impressed by you.

we compete next?

[RANA] Oh, sorry, I did
not mean to insult you.

Stop it, Jina.

You know that Rattle
became an E-Pandora

00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:18,291
so she would never have to
worry about starving again.

Release me right now,

I know that you're upset,

a fight if possible.

is something wrong?

[AMELIA] I just heard
that you volunteered

214

to be given the Mark IV!

It's not that big a deal.

Why're you so worked up?

Why am I worked up?

This is the Mark IV
we're talking about!

you'll even survive!

Let go of me!

Just like you did
with the Mark III!

I hate how you're
always trying to bear

everyone else's
burdens for them!

We're in this together!

You already died
once for us.

I won't let you do it again!

However, thanks to
your experience,

231
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:24,166
the Mark III tests went
back to the drawing board

232
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:28,333
and no one else had to endure
the pain that you did.

Stop worrying, Amelia.

234
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:31,750

turn to step up.

236

I plan on surviving
through my contract,

237
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:37,125
then going back to
living a normal life.

238
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:38,833
Isn't that what we all want?

239

[RATTLE] Mm-hm.

240
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:42,083

got that kid brother

even you won't compare with me!

Please, Dr. Ohara!

248

I'll make the
arrangements.

so much, doctor!

you'll be using for
the Mark IV project?

belongs to her.

like doing sit-ups!

the Mark IV experiment.

271
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:05,875
[SATELLIZER] Why are
you telling me this?

272
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:08,125
[JINA] Because the Original
Pandora data that's being used

273
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:11,125
in the Mark IV is
none other than yours.

Thank you for that.

[SATELLIZER] What?

00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:15,958
But I didn't have anything
to do with their decision!

[JINA] That doesn't
really matter.

So I hope there aren't
any hard feelings. Heh.

it's gonna be that easy?

at the mock battle.

I think Kazuya should
spend more time

00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:36,000
Not too shabby.

319
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:37,125
Jina!

320
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:39,666
Ah! All right!

[FEMALE NEWSCASTER]
Today, Chevalier revealed

327
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:06,375
the initial results of
its E-Pandora Project.

328
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:09,291
The project had previously
been veiled in secrecy.

329
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:11,333
The E-Pandora has power
that is comparable

330
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:12,666
to an Original Pandora.

331
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,625
She possesses advanced
skills and is capable

332
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:17,083
of producing a Volt Weapon.

333
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:19,958
In response, leading experts
have expressed optimism,

334
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:21,666
stating that they
now have high hopes

335
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:25,208
for the promising
E-Pandora Project.

336
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:26,416
[MALE STAFF 3A] Response
to the demonstration

337
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,041
has largely been positive.

338
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:31,916
Best of all, we now have public
support for the E-Pandora.

339
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,291
[SPENCER] We'll show off the
second and third successes

340
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:36,458
in a similar fashion.

341
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:40,458
[SPENCER] Hm?
How is the subject?

342
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:43,458
The unusual Stigmata activity
has not stopped progressing.

343
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:46,083
It's even eating away
at her body's tissues.

344
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,375
[SPENCER]
That is to be expected.

345
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:50,166
[MALE STAFF] Uh?

346
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,458
[SPENCER] However.

347
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:55,750
You need to keep her
alive for the time being.

348
00:18:55,833 --> 00:19:00,416
Yes. By any means necessary.

349

[alarm sounds]

350
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:17,625
[OHARA]
Is she conscious?

351
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:18,916
[MALE STAFF 3A] Yes.

352
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,500
And more than likely
she's aware that she's...

353
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:25,416
She's changing
into a Nova.

354
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,083
What a terrible fate.

355
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:31,750
I'm sorry, Jina.

356
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:36,583
But there was never
any chance of success.

357
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:38,416
I'm sorry.

358
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:47,958
[RATTLE]
Um, Amelia?

359
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:49,750
Do you think Jina's doing okay?

360
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:51,416
It's been three days.

361
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,833
The doctor said that she would
be fine, but the procedure

362
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:56,541
is pretty draining so she's
probably in recovery right now.

363
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:58,916
You're right, Dr. Ohara
would let us know

364
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
if anything was wrong.

365
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:02,208
Yeah! So quit
worrying about Jina.

366
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:03,666
She'll be out of
there in no time!

367
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,041
[RATTLE] Mm.

[MALE AIDE] I'm afraid we've
tried everything possible.

369
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,458

of time until she dies.

Congrats Jina!

how proud we are!

exactly should we do?

any better ideas?

It is imperative that
you stop this thing!
