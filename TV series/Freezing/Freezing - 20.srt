Today, Chevalier revealed

2
00:00:18,708 --> 00:00:20,500
the initial result of
its E-Pandora Project.

3
00:00:20,583 --> 00:00:23,500
The project has previously
been veiled in secrecy.

4
00:00:23,583 --> 00:00:25,541
The E-Pandora have
power that is comparable

5
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:26,958
to an Original Pandora.

6
00:00:27,041 --> 00:00:28,375
She possesses advanced skills

7
00:00:28,458 --> 00:00:31,416
and is capable of
producing a Volt Weapon.

8
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:40,833
How many times are you
going to watch that, doctor?

9
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:44,125
I'm just hoping my
worries are unfounded.

into ordinarily
incompatible girls

00:00:57,875 --> 00:01:00,791
takes a heavy enough toll
on their bodies as it is.

13
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:03,750
Going a step further by using
these Mark IV nanomachines

14
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:07,875
to enhance them even more
is just plain reckless.

15
00:01:07,958 --> 00:01:11,083
You're Chevalier's most
powerful active duty Pandora.

16
00:01:11,166 --> 00:01:12,250
You don't think too highly

17
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:15,083
of your artificial
inferiors' abilities.

18

Am I right, Yi?

[YI]
It isn't like that.

20
00:01:18,125 --> 00:01:21,208
I don't fight because I'm trying
to prove myself to anyone.

21
00:01:21,291 --> 00:01:24,958
I chose this way of life to keep
my children off the battlefield.

22
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:27,708
Why become a Pandora
if those we aim to protect

23
00:01:27,791 --> 00:01:28,916
choose to fight as well?

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,333
It shouldn't be their
sacrifice to make.

[GENGO] Well...

27
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:36,541
I suppose that is one
way you could look at it.

No. I'll take this.

[SPENCER] None of us

00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:31,625
the unfortunate accident
that occurred.

00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:34,041
Given our line of research,
unexpected problems

40
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:37,000
shouldn't come as much of
a surprise to you, Doctor.

41
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,750
I'm sure that the E-Pandora are

42
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:40,500
fully aware of
the risks as well.

43
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:41,541
Even so!

44
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:43,375
The improved Mark IV
isn't ready!

45

Don't worry about that.

[SPENCER] I took it upon myself
to continue development.

00:03:58,291 --> 00:03:59,625
And why is that?!

I'm the chief of operations!
I didn't authorize this!

Stop being so dramatic,

51
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:06,250
and think about our situation.

54

Losing a few girls here and
there is not only acceptable,

00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:17,041
it is expected.

Such is the nature
of the experiment.

replacements should be

I heard some of us
had to kill it

out of hand. [gasps]

I guess it was all a lie.

you guys don't have
to worry about it.

I was the one that killed it,

Uhh...

The girl changed
into a Nova,

77
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:03,958
and exterminating Nova is what
we Pandora are supposed to do.

So yeah, the way I see it, I was
pretty much just doing my job.

Maybe, but for Chevalier
to purposely restart

159
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:08,416
I mean, it's bad enough
that we still don't know

160
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,708
how to communicate
with 'em.

161
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:13,375
But they complicate
things by acting crazy.

162
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:15,375
They suddenly appear
out of thin air,

163
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:17,666
then after a while they get
dimensionally compressed,

164
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:18,833
and before you know it...

165
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:19,750
Kablam!

166
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:21,000
[gasps]

167
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:24,041
Heh. It's whatever though.

168
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:26,583
Who the hell knows
what they're thinking.

169
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:31,916
[ROXANNE] Hopefully none will
ever show up around this dump.

170
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,666
Yeah, if this place
ever gets destroyed,

171
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,541
we might as well kiss
the world goodbye.

172
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:41,208
[ROXANNE] The power
reactor inside.

173
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:43,500
You said it's called
the Photon Generator?

174
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,666
[FEMALE RUNNER 8A]
Yeah. I heard they've got

175
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,625
twenty years' worth
of the sun's energy

176
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:48,625
stored inside that thing.

177
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:51,208
[ROXANNE] Oookay.
That means nothing to me.

178
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:52,958
[FEMALE RUNNER 8B] Think of it
as a hundred times stronger

179
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:54,291
than an H-bomb.

180
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:55,958
[ROXANNE] Do I look like
a rocket scientist to you?

181
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:57,583
[FEMALE RUNNER 8A]
Not even a little. [laughs]

182
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:58,833
Why would they
need something

183
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:01,250
so ridiculously dangerous
to power this lab?

184
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:02,916
Like, I'm sure it
does tricky stuff,

185
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,083
but do we really
need all that juice?

186
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:08,083
[FEMALE RUNNER 8B] Have you
heard of the Tower of Babel?

187
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:09,666
Why are you
bringing that up?

188
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,916
Ah. Isn't that the tower humans
built so they could reach God,

189
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,958
but God got pissed off
at their cockiness

190
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:16,708
and he totally destroyed it?

191
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:19,916
What does that have
to do with anything?

192
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:25,583
If it was human
wisdom and ingenuity

193
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:29,041
that angered God enough to
tear down the Tower of Babel.

194
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:32,500
Maybe that means the
Nova are actually...

195
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:35,625
Wait a sec.
Surely your not saying that--

196
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:39,458
[ROXANNE]
I'm beginning to wonder

197
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:42,208
if they really are the enemy.

198
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:58,791
[clock ticks]

199
00:10:58,875 --> 00:10:59,458
[knocking]

200
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:00,875
[ANDREI] Huh?

201
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:06,000
Why are you here?

202
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,500
I was wondering if
you might allow me

203
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:10,916
some time to have a word
in private with Ms. Mably.

204
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,416
[ANDREI sighs]

205
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,083
[ANDREI] Unfortunately,
she's in no condition

206
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:16,666
to talk with anyone
at the moment.

207
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:19,416
[AMELIA] I will
only take a minute.

208
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,458
Sorry, but there's something I
insist on telling her directly.

209
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:26,250
Please, I'm begging you.

210
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:28,666
[door shuts]

211
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,416
[AMELIA gasps]

212
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:37,833
[door opens]

213
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:43,583
[ANDREI] I need to
step out for a moment.

214
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:48,958
[AMELIA] Thank you.

215
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:57,708
I respect you.

216
00:11:57,791 --> 00:12:00,250
And I can honestly say you're
one of the few people here

217
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:02,375
I feel that way about.

218
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:06,833
[AMELIA] And you are one of
the few people I've ever met

219
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:11,708
in my life that I truly respect
from the bottom of my heart.

220
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:14,958
They're still pushing through
more Mark IV experiments.

221
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:17,166
And they're even using
another friend of mine.

222
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:20,458
At this rate, I won't
have any friends left!

223
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:22,291
But I plan to fight
for my friends now,

224
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:24,958
just like you did before.

225
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:28,875
I'll do whatever it takes,
like a true Pandora!

226
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:33,791
Goodbye, Elizabeth.

227
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:50,500
[AMELIA] This is the spot.
Rendezvous here in ten minutes.

228
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:52,833
You mean we're not all
gonna go there together?

229
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:55,291
It'll be a lot easier for
us to evade any pursuers

230
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:57,625
if we split into groups and
take different escape routes.

231
00:12:57,708 --> 00:12:59,083
But what if
something happens?

232
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:00,458
Simple.

233
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:02,291
If any one of us can't
reach the rendezvous point,

234
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:05,541
then we leave them behind
and carry on with the plan.

235
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:10,250
[AMELIA] Rattle?

236
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:16,083
[RATTLE] Mm-hm.
Yeah. I got it.

237
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:31,291
[sighs] It's been too long.

238
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:33,625
I thought she would have
come back earlier.

239
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:35,708
[CATHY] Hi Rana!
Who are you talking about?

240
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:37,000
[RANA gasps]

241
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:39,583
[RANA] Whoa! Hello,
Miss Godspeed of the East!

242
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:42,625
You thought who would
have come back earlier?

243
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:45,083
Oh, I was referring
to Satellizer.

244
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:46,916
[CATHY] Did Satellizer
go somewhere?

245
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,208
[RANA] Mm-hm. She was
injured in battle,

246
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:51,416
but they were unable to treat
her at this laboratory,

247
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,958
so she was taken offsite.

248
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:55,541
[CATHY] Well, was
she hurt very badly?

249
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:57,041
[RANA]
Maybe so.

250
00:13:57,125 --> 00:14:00,500
Apparently, she and Elizabeth
Mably had a disagreement.

251
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:03,250
She had a fight
with Elizabeth?

252
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:04,458
I'm sorry to hear that.

253
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:07,000
Terrible things have
happened to her family.

254
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:08,666
[RANA] Yeah, to her
and her family.

255
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:09,916
[CATHY gasps]

256
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,708
Wait, did something
happen to Elizabeth too?

257
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:15,208
[RANA]
Oh, I am not sure.

258
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:18,125
If you know, please tell me!
I haven't seen her lately!

259
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:20,958
Aaahhh! Aahh!
Quit it you pervert!

260
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:22,875
Let go of me!
Stop it right now!

261
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:24,125
Hey, I know you!

262
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:27,083
You are the Mammaries of
Honduras! Am I right?

263
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,208
I am the Maverick
of Walpurgis.

264
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:30,583
But nice try.

265
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:32,500
Shut up and let go of me!
Who cares about that?

266
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:34,500
What's happened to Elizabeth?

267
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:36,708
[clock ticks]

268
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:39,125
[CATHY]
This is awful.

269
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:40,833
[ANDREI] Your shock
is understandable.

270
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:43,291
But I assure you, it's all true.

271
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:45,958
Not only did they make
my lady suffer like this,

272
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:48,375
but they went after
her family, too!

273
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:51,500
This is how Chevalier
gets things done!

274
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:54,000
[door opens]

275
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:56,125
[gasps]

276
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:57,458
[CATHY]
Where are you going?

277
00:14:57,541 --> 00:15:00,291
[JULIA] I'm bored,
so I'm leaving.

278
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:02,750
You're just gonna
walk out! Why?

279
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:04,666
You don't feel anything?

280
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,791
She is your fellow Pandora!

281
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:09,583
What do I care?
It's her own fault.

282
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:12,833
[JULIA chuckles]

283
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:14,458
Then again, I'm sure
I'd feel something

284
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:17,958
if you were lying in bed.
In bed with me.

285
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:21,541
[door shuts]

286
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:27,333
[footsteps]

287
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:29,500
[OHARA] Dr. Aoi!

288
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:35,583
[OHARA breathes heavily]

289
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:37,083
[OHARA]
Look at this!

290
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:38,125
I did it!

291
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:39,916
I've finally decoded
the genome map

292
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
of Maria Lancelot's
holy remains!

293
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:43,875
You said I couldn't
do it, but I did!

294
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:46,833
Now her power is ours!

295
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:48,625
Doctor Aoi?

296
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:53,375
[GENGO] "And the Lord came down
to see the city and the tower,

297
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:55,333
which the children
of men had built.

298
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:57,958
And the Lord said,
Behold, the people are one,

299
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,833
and they have all one language;

300
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:02,958
and now nothing will be
restrained from them."

301
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:10,500
[GENGO] "Therefore is the
name of it called Babel."

302
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:12,208
[OHARA] Are you saying
that what I'm doing

303
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:14,333
is comparable to building
the Tower of Babel?

304
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:16,458
[GENGO] In response
to the Tower of Babel,

305
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:18,750
God dispensed divine punishment.

306
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:20,541
He gave many
languages to a world

307
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:22,708
which previously only knew one,

308
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:25,916
and thus He gave birth to chaos.

309
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,750
[OHARA] What are
you trying to say?

310
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:32,750
I think you know enough
to connect the dots.

311
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:33,916
Wait, are you suggesting

312
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,916
this is how humans
relate to the Nova?

313
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:40,541
You're kidding me.

314
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:43,125

[OHARA gasps]

316
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:51,958
[OHARA] So you think
Maria is God?

317
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:53,458
You're being ridiculous!

318
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:55,791
You know that the number of
Stigmata-compatible subjects

319
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:56,875
is dropping rapidly!

320
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:58,583
Soon we'll have
nothing to work with!

321
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:00,833
I know mass-producing
Pandora is impossible!

322
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:03,958
But we still need to survive and
that means we need my research!

[GENGO]
Enough, Ms. Ohara!

324
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:09,000
That would be blasphemy.

325
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:11,458
You think this
is blasphemy?

326
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:14,291
I hate to say it, Doctor,
but this is all your doing!

327
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:16,250
You are the one who
gave her that name.

328
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:18,250
You named her after
the woman who is said

329
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:19,958
to have been the mother of God.

330
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:22,000
Well, that is all an illusion.

331
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:25,000
We need her for our research!

332
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:27,833
Why do you insist on worshipping
a piece of dead flesh?

333
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:29,333
Why is she so important to you?

334

I wasn't wrong.

Even after all these years, I
know that I was right about her.

339
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:52,666
Gengo Aoi. You revered
Maria as a goddess.

340
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:55,833
No, something greater.

341
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:14,375
She's only a resource.

342
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:17,583
And her power must be
harnessed by humanity.

343
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:19,166
It must.

I never expected them to
take such drastic measures.

This could be the

Rattle, what are
you doing here?

It was obvious that you
were trying to help us

00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,958
escape by sacrificing
yourself, again!

But I'm not gonna
let you do that!

361
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:16,958
You once told me and Jina that
we're your sisters-in-arms,

your irreplaceable friends.

So don't you dare make me
leave you behind, Amelia,

You hear me?

I won't!

So. We've decided

I've always dreamed of being
able to produce Volt Weapons!
