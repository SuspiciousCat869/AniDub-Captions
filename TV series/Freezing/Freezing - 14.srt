1
00:00:21,583 --> 00:00:24,291
[RANA] That Pandora, the one
Charles referred to as a zombie,

2
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:26,791
certainly does not
mince words, does she?

3
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:28,375
[KAZUYA]
Her name is Roxanne.

4
00:00:28,458 --> 00:00:30,958
[RANA] I feared her words to the
E-Pandora would start a fight.

5
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:33,833
But they did not, so... Yay!

6
00:00:33,916 --> 00:00:35,375
[SATELLIZER]
Nevertheless...

7
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:40,208
[SATELLIZER] That's no guarantee
a fight won't break out later.

8
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:41,791
[RANA] Oh!

9
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:45,083
Look, here it is! I found the
room in which I will be staying!

10
00:00:45,166 --> 00:00:46,083
[KAZUYA]
All right.

11
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:48,375
Now where could our room be?

12
00:00:52,916 --> 00:00:55,208
What did he
mean our room?

13
00:00:56,333 --> 00:00:58,000
They are sharing one?

14
00:00:58,083 --> 00:00:59,333
This is impure!

15
00:00:59,416 --> 00:01:01,416
Why do you two get to
co-habitate together?

16
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,333
Kazuya is the man of
my destiny, not yours!

17
00:01:04,416 --> 00:01:07,125
What foul trickery have
you pulled, Satellizer?

18
00:01:07,208 --> 00:01:08,458
Don't blame me and Kazuya;

19
00:01:08,541 --> 00:01:10,458
rooms here are always
assigned to partners

20
00:01:10,541 --> 00:01:12,208
who have shared
combat experience.

21
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:13,791
They what?

22
00:01:13,875 --> 00:01:16,958
Surely you jest since you two
have not even had a baptism yet!

23
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:19,125
That makes no difference.

24
00:01:19,208 --> 00:01:20,708
We're assigned to
be roommates because

25
00:01:20,791 --> 00:01:22,500
the higher-ups recognize
what you can't.

26
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:24,708
Kazuya and I happen
to share a bond.

27
00:01:24,791 --> 00:01:26,791
Without a baptism,
that is utter nonsense

28
00:01:26,875 --> 00:01:28,791
so I am certain you pulled
strings out of jealousy

29
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:31,416
to keep Kazuya apart from me,
who unlike you, would be

30
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,500
more than happy to be touched
by his tender, loving hands!

31
00:01:33,583 --> 00:01:35,375
Again, the higher-ups
decided this.

32
00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:37,125
I don't see what
the big deal is!

33
00:01:37,208 --> 00:01:39,916
[RANA] If that is so, then
switch rooms with me right now!

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,458
[SATELLIZER] What?
Don't be stupid!

35
00:01:41,541 --> 00:01:42,833
[RANA]
I will be stupid!

36
00:01:42,916 --> 00:01:44,000
[KAZUYA sighs]

37
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:21,708
[CHIFFON] It's hard to
believe we're in Alaska

38
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:23,833
right now, isn't it?

39
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:24,875
[ELIZABETH] Hm.

40
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:26,875
This isn't your
standard facility.

41
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:28,875
It used to be a civilian agency.

42
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,125
Chevalier acquired it
and converted it to serve

43
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:32,583
as the E-Pandora Laboratory.

44
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:34,041
Y'know, I've gotta admit

45
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:37,083
I could get used to a military
base as cozy as this!

46
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:39,000
Oh, is that so?

47
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:42,000
Considering that this place is
supposed to be a gathering spot

48
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:44,208
for elite Pandora from
all over the world,

49
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:47,083
it strikes me as being
a little too laid-back.

50
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:47,875
[CHIFFON] Oh!

51
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:48,958
[ELIZABETH] Hm?

52
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:58,875
Everything okay
with you two?

53
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:00,958
[SATELLIZER gasps]
[RANA chuckles]

54
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:02,958
[SATELLIZER]
A carnival tomorrow?

55
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:04,125
That's right.

56
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:05,500
They'll be holding
mock battles to get data

57
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:07,666
on the power differences
between the two groups.

58
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:10,583
They want to see how all of the
Evolution Pandora's abilities

59
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:12,208
compare to us Originals.

60
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:13,750
[SATELLIZER]
Evolution Pandora?

61
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:17,625
[CATHY] Yep, that's the official
name of the E-Pandora.

62
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:19,125
[SATELLIZER] Oh.

63
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:21,375
It's still odd to think ordinary
girls can become Pandora.

64
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:23,458
There is no need to
be such a worry-wart

65
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:25,625
since the E-Pandora are
supposed to be a good thing;

66
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:28,000
why even Elizabeth said
implementing them into our ranks

67
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:29,750
should solve the
Pandora shortage.

68
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:32,958
And if our cooperation will help
create more-evolved Pandora.

69
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:35,250
ones that can effectively
combat the Nova,

70
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:38,666
then I will enthusiastically
assist in the task at hand!

71
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:41,333
I wish I could feel as
positive as you do, Rana.

72
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:44,125
Must you always be such a
negative ninny, Satellizer?

73
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:45,500
With an attitude like that,

74
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:47,875
it is no wonder why you
have not had a baptism yet.

75
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:48,875
[SATELLIZER gasps]

76
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:51,125
Oh, wow, you really
haven't had one?

77
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,500
[SATELLIZER] Uhh...

78
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:55,166
[CATHY] Wait, I thought
Kazuya Aoi was your Limiter.

79
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,208
He is, isn't he?

80
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:58,375
Well, yes, that's
correct, he is,

81
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:00,333
but he and I still haven't um...

82
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:01,875
[RANA] They have not
done it because

83
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:04,083
our Untouchable Queen here is
too afraid of touching him,

84
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:06,041
which is a problem
I would never have!

85
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:09,291
[SATELLIZER]
Uh! Um, I...

86
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:13,666
I wouldn't. I wouldn't test my
patience if I were you, 'kay?

87
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,250
Keep that up and
I'll make you regret it!

88
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:19,208
Your threat is as empty as
your commitment to Kazuya!

89
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:21,083
Where are you going,
Little Miss No Baptism?

90
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:24,750
I am right here if you wish
to make me regret what I said!

91
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:34,750
[RANA snores]

92
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:41,958
[ELIZABETH] In my view,
artificial or not,

93
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:44,791
a Pandora's a Pandora,
plain and simple.

94
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:47,375
We need more help,
and given the circumstances,

95
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:50,291
I think it would be a mistake
to reject Pandora volunteers

96
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:52,125
strictly because they
happen to be the product

97
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:53,166
of some experiment.

98
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:54,541
You really believe that?

they were basically already

100

done with it before they ever
got permission from Chevalier

to move forward
in the first place.

00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:32,958
[CROWD cheers]

159
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:35,458
[CROWD]
C'mon Amelia, you got this!

160
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,708
I am confident you will
take the brass ring

161
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:44,041
and proclaim victory over
your opponent, Elizabeth,

162
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,791
and as a fellow Pandora
from your alma mater...

163
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:47,416
[ELIZABETH] This isn't
a game, you know?

164
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,458
It's interesting you
should say that.

165
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:52,833
Because you're not even
taking this seriously.

166
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:55,458
I can tell, so don't
try to deny it.

167
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:57,166
Well, if that's the
impression I gave you,

168
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:58,416
then I do apologize.

169
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,541
[AMELIA]
Save it. Besides.

170
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:01,958
You'll change your mind.

171
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:03,583
After a few minutes
in the ring with me,

172
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:05,208
you'll see what
I'm capable of.

173
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:12,000
[cheers and applause]

174
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:14,083
First let me ask you this.

175
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:16,000
How strong are you
compared to the other two

176
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:18,708
E-Pandora my comrades defeated?

177
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:20,250
Why even bother asking?

178
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:22,500
You'll find out in the ring
soon enough, blondie.

179
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:23,958
[ELIZABETH]
You misunderstand.

180
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:27,000
I asked so I can gauge how
much I should hold back.

181
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:28,541
[AMELIA]
How arrogant.

182
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:32,250
Well, if you must know, I'd say
I'm three times as powerful.

183
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:33,833
I hope you're being honest.

184
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:37,083
Overestimating will
result in a lot of pain.

185
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:56,500
[buzzer]

186
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:58,208
[FEMALE ANNOUNCEMENT]
Begin battle!

187
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:07,791
[AMELIA]
Volt Weapon. Deploy!

188
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:14,291
Ah, so you're able to
produce a Volt Weapon.

189
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:17,083
Your friends couldn't so this
makes you quite a bit different.

190
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:18,625
Speaking of Volt Weapons,

191
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:20,583
why have you not
produced yours yet?

192
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:23,583
Against you, it's
totally unnecessary.

193
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:25,875
You're only three
times stronger, right?

194
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:27,250
All you Originals.

195
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:29,208
You're naturally
compatible with Stigmata,

196
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:31,958
so everything has always
been easy for you.

197
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:33,500
But understand this.

198
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:35,375
We refuse to stand by
and allow you to

199
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:38,791
belittle all of the hard work
that we E-Pandora have done!

200
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,625
[AMELIA grunts]

201
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:47,500
[gasps]

202
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:53,791
That attack was sloppy
and easy to avoid.

203
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:56,375
Now, let me make something
perfectly clear.

204
00:11:56,458 --> 00:12:00,041
My intention is not to
belittle you. However.

205
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:02,291
The purpose of this
mock battle is to determine

206
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:05,541
the differences in our strength
and gather the subsequent data.

207
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:08,458
Therefore I feel it is my
obligation to do what I must

208
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:10,583
to provide the most
accurate data possible.

209
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:12,166
[AMELIA] Let go!

210
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:14,583
[AMELIA yells]

211
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:18,250
Acceleration?

212
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:20,375
Wow, her techniques
are really incredible.

213
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:22,583
She's a lot more powerful
than her two friends were!

214
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:24,000
Get her, Amelia!

215
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:25,875
You can do it!

216
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,666
Double Acceleration?

217
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,375
Ah, That's nothing special;

218
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:35,166
I can do lagged
intervals like that.

219
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,375
Yeah, but you're naturally
Stigmata-compatible

220
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:39,333
whereas Amelia is not.

221
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:40,375
[AMELIA] Hah!

222
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:43,541
[RATTLE gasps]
[JINA] So close!

223
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:46,083
Do you seriously believe
that you can take me down

224
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:48,208
with a mere
Double Acceleration?

225
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:54,083
[AMELIA yells]

226
00:12:57,708 --> 00:13:01,041
[AMELIA groans]

227
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:15,916
Let's call it quits, okay?

228
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,333
You're in no condition for any
more Accelerations, so stop.

229
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:23,625
Your body is already
exhibiting the warning signs.

230
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:26,583
I can still fight you.

231
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:29,291
[ELIZABETH] I request
this match be called off.

232
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:32,000
The health and safety of my
opponent is already in danger,

233
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:33,333
and I fear she can't
take any more of this.

234
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:35,333
[OHARA]
Please continue.

235
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:38,083
We have not yet collected
all the required data.

236
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:40,125
Fight until she's incapacitated.

237
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:42,666
Those are the rules
of the match.

238
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,250
[ELIZABETH] And do
you consent to this?

239
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:46,625
I have to.

240
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:48,666
I appreciate
your concern.

241
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,291
It's a nice gesture.

242
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:53,750
Truly kind. But.

243
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,291
There's no way
I could quit now.

244
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:58,125
I couldn't live with
myself if I lost

245
00:13:58,208 --> 00:14:01,458
without giving a hundred
percent. I'll continue.

246
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:05,125
What, is she serious?

247
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:08,541
She's willing to push
herself that far?

248
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:10,291
Fine, if that's how
you want to do this,

249
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:12,250
then you can have it your way.

250
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:14,291
Just don't say
I didn't warn you.

251
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:23,416
Whoa, she just
used a Tempest!

252
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,625
Acceleration's not
her only trick.

253
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:32,500
I'm not going down, so give
me everything you've got!

254
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:34,833
[ELIZABETH] She can't keep
taking hits like that.

255
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:36,666
I've got to end this.

256
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:41,000
[ELIZABETH] I have
to knock her out.

257
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:42,166
[AMELIA grunts]

No, not yet.

260
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:04,291
It's... not over.

261
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:10,166
[ELIZABETH] I just
gave her a concussion.

262
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,625
Why is she doing this?

263
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:13,958
[RATTLE] Amelia, stop!

264
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:15,791
You've gotta put an
end to this, Doctor!

265
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:17,083
Right now!

266
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,875
[ELIZABETH]
What's driving her?

267
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:21,708
Is it her E-Pandora pride?

268
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:23,833
In that case...

269
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:26,041
I've been going
about this all wrong.

270
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:30,250
It seems it's not her body I
need to break, but her mind.

[ELIZABETH grunts]

274
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:37,041
[ELIZABETH] Why did you
decide to stop it now?

275
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:40,791
I told you it would continue
until she became incapacitated.

[ELIZABETH gasps]

[ELIZABETH gasps]

[ELIZABETH] She's standing
but she's unconscious!

279
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,000
[RATTLE] Amelia! Oh, no.
[E-PANDORA 2A] Say something!

280
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:51,833
[JINA]
Let's get her off her feet!

281
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:52,458
[JINA] Amelia!

282
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:54,041
Somebody help her!

283
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:56,041
Damn, she gave it
everything she had.

284
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:58,708
And this was just
a mock battle, too.

285
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,541
[SATELLIZER] Strange.

286
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:04,458
Why would she risk
so much for a test?

287
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:14,291
[RATTLE chews]

288
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:24,166
[JINA]
Aahhh!

00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:27,791
[JINA] Rattle!

291
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:30,375
How can you stuff your face
at a time like this?

292
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:31,750
Oh. Sorry.

293
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:35,166
[AMELIA]
Stop it, Jina.

294
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:37,833
You know why Rattle
does what she does.

295
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:40,541
She became an E-Pandora so
she would never have to worry

296
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,708
about starving again,
just let her eat.

297
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:45,083
You mind telling me what's
really upsetting you?

298
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:46,791
[JINA]
It isn't fair, Amelia!

299
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:48,375
The Originals were
born with bodies

300
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:50,208
that are Stigmata-compatible!

301
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:52,583
They've had everything handed
to them on a silver platter

302
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:55,166
while we've had to
fight for the crumbs!

303
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,083
They're like a bunch
of spoiled rich girls

304
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:58,625
who think they're
better than us.

305
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:01,208
I don't know why!

306
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:03,041
We're not that
different, are we?

307
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:05,875
All of us here are
Pandora, right?

308
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,333
[RATTLE sighs]

309
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:11,166
[JINA] Huh?

310
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:13,708
We are Pandora, and it's
impossible to change

311
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:15,208
where we came from,

312
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:17,958
but that doesn't mean we can't
change where we're going.

313
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:20,166
This program has been a step
in the right direction

314
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:22,041
for all of us.

315
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:26,000
Rattle escaped a life of
starvation when she joined.

316
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:27,833
After you were sold
by your parents,

317
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:32,416
this place became the home
you had always wanted.

318
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:36,166
And. As for me...

319
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:40,416
I was introduced to the
two of you when I joined.

320
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,458
And you've become more
than just friends.

321
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:44,000
You're my sisters-in-arms,

322
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:47,250
and we can accomplish anything
we set our minds to, right?

323
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:51,583
We do count, we do have value,
and we will learn from this.

324
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:53,333
We're E-Pandora.

325
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:55,375
So let's hold our heads high.

326
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:57,916
We're warriors who fight
for mankind, remember?

327
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,416
[JINA and RATTLE] Yeah.

328
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,333
Sure, we may have had our
butts handed to us today,

329
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:04,583
but we only lost
a battle, not the war,

330
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:07,791
so let's strive to become
as strong as the Originals.

331
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:10,125
Right, exactly!
We might get knocked down,

332
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:12,416
but we'll just keep
getting back up again!

333
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,000
We're gonna get through this!

334
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:16,958
[RATTLE] Heh. Yeah we will,
because we're a team!

335
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:18,875
[JINA]
Let's do it, ladies!

336
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:20,833
[AMELIA] Come on!

337
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:22,500
[RANA] Watch out!

338
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:24,708
Here comes Rana Linchen!

339
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:32,375
This pool is incredible;

340
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:34,916
I'm still amazed
they even have one.

341
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:39,041
[ELIZABETH gasps]

342
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:41,166
[ROXANNE]
Yo, Elizabeth!

343
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:45,458
[SATELLIZER and RANA yelp]

344
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,500
You think this
one's weird, too?

345
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:50,666
At least I'm not naked like her!

346
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:53,041
So, what was it like
to actually fight one?

347
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:55,041
And more importantly,
do you think any of those

348
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:57,375
E-Pandora chicks are
gonna be worth a crap?

349
00:18:57,458 --> 00:18:59,625
[ELIZABETH] I hope
you're not that blind,

350
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:01,833
but then again, look
at what you're wearing.

351
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:03,125
[ROXANNE] Huh?

352
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:08,916
[murmuring]

353
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,916
[ELIZABETH] Oh.

354
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Well, this place certainly
looks busy today.

355
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:16,833
Is this seat taken?

356
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:18,250
[JINA] It's you.

357
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:21,041
I'd rather you call me Elizabeth
just like my friends do.

358
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:23,375
In any case, would you
ladies mind if I sit here?

359
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:25,916
[JINA]
Uh... No, go ahead.

360
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,916
[ELIZABETH] Thank you.
That's very kind.

361
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:33,750
[CAFETERIA murmuring]
Wha...? Huh...?

362
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:40,875
[RATTLE] Your lips.

363
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:41,625
[ELIZABETH] Huh?

364
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:42,791
Sorry, what was that?

365
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:43,875
Oh, um. Well.

366
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:47,208
I think you have
really pretty lips.

367
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:51,791
And your lip gloss. I'd love
to know what brand it is.

368
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:54,916
It's become a habit of mine
to always wear Mably.

369
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
You mean Mably,
the gi-normous company

370
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:58,666
that makes all the best
stuff in the world?

371
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:01,458
I wear it mostly because it's
a great looking quality product,

372
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:03,541
but it doesn't hurt that
my family makes it.

373
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:06,916
[JINA] "Family?" Wait, you're
one of those Mablys?

374
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Yes.

375
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:09,416
Oh, wow.

376
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,416
That goes well beyond growing up
without any hardship.

377
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,166
We could never
compete with you.

378
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,791
[ELIZABETH]
That's where you're wrong.

379
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:19,041
Your upbringings had nothing
to do with your defeat.

380
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:22,041
Just as my family had nothing
to do with my victory.

381
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:24,208
I've been a Pandora for
longer than you have,

382
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:26,333
and I was born
stigmata compatible.

383
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:28,541
That is the reason I won.

384
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:31,375
Unfortunately, the
world isn't always fair.

385
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:33,000
Plenty of people
throughout history

386
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:36,166
have been born with nothing, but
they didn't let that stop them.

387
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,583
They pushed themselves,

388
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:39,666
and became some of the
greatest people in the world.

389
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,333
After what you
showed me today,

390
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:42,791
I know you can do the same.

391
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:45,166
I have no doubt.

392
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:46,416
I don't care where
you're from;

393
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,833
the only thing
that matters to me

394
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:50,166
is making sure that
you all grow stronger.

395
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,166
[JINA and RATTLE]
Huh?

396
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,375
Why is that?

397
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:54,541
In order to protect
the world we all share,

398
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:57,458
we Original Pandora have been
tasked with using our data

399
00:20:57,541 --> 00:20:59,625
for the purpose of turning
you into warriors,

400
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:01,750
and I have no doubt
we can achieve this

401
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:03,750
if we all work together.

402
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:05,125
[AMELIA] Uh...

403
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:07,166
Yes, Elizabeth is
correct, everyone,

404
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,166
and we Originals are
committed to making sure

405
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:11,083
all of you become stronger!

406
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:12,708
[applause]

407
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:14,958
[AMELIA]
Uh. Thank you really.

408
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:17,166
There is no need for
you to thank us.

409
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,625
We're all Pandora here,

410
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:21,833
it's an honor to fight alongside
someone as brave as you.

411
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:23,416
[ROXANNE]
Same here!

412
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,375
What you did in that ring took
some major-league guts, girl!

413
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:28,083
[CHIFFON]
Look at Elizabeth.

414
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:31,000
She really is a natural-born
leader, don't you think?

415
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:32,083
[SATELLIZER] Hm.

416
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,625
[MALE AIDE] The mood's
certainly improved.

417
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:38,625
Too bad we have to ruin it;
do we really have to tell them?

418
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:41,416
We don't have a choice.

419
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,083
After all...

420
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:48,708
This is war.

421
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:51,125
As of now, we're moving
to the next phase, Doctor.

422
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:53,250
[OHARA]
But, Secretary Spencer...

423
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:55,208
The survival rate
of the E-Pandora

424
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:56,750
is of no concern to me.

425
00:21:56,833 --> 00:21:58,250
There's no need
to worry since

426
00:21:58,333 --> 00:22:01,541
new test subjects are
so readily available.

427
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:03,666
And in that case, you
shouldn't have any qualms

428
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:07,500
about administering the Mark IV,
so get to it, Doctor.

429
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:43,666
[CHARLES] You know that
as Pandora, it's our duty...

430
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,416
[AMELIA] I don't understand!
Mark III a failure.

431
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,166
[JINA] You already died once for
us. I won't let you do it again!

432
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:50,666
[SATELLIZER]
Next time: "Mark IV."
