1
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:19,041
You planned this fight...?

2
00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:20,791
Is that what you
are trying to say?

3
00:00:20,875 --> 00:00:23,625
It was easy enough to get
you both to take the bait,

4
00:00:23,708 --> 00:00:25,791
but things didn't quite
turn out as we intended.

5
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:28,583
So you lied to me
to get your way?

6
00:00:28,666 --> 00:00:29,958
Not quite...

7
00:00:30,041 --> 00:00:31,708
Since Satellizer really did
make Kazuya her partner

8
00:00:31,791 --> 00:00:33,875
without giving him
a proper baptism.

9
00:00:33,958 --> 00:00:35,750
I knew what
I was getting into...

10
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:38,708
Besides, I'm the one who
wanted to team up with her!

11
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:42,250
Then it seems that
I have misunderstood...

12
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:45,291
As you know, the hierarchy
at this school is absolute.

13
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:46,958
That's why we couldn't sit back

14
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:48,916
and watch when a
second-year like Satellizer

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,458
started baring her
fangs at third years.

16
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:53,375
And since she's setting
such a poor example

17
00:00:53,458 --> 00:00:54,916
for other underclassmen,

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,083
the girls and I figured we'd
better nip this in the bud

19
00:00:57,166 --> 00:00:59,250
while she was still manageable.

20
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:00,791
Okay, enough talk...

21
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:04,083
Try speaking with your fists,
"Oh honored upperclassmen."

22
00:01:04,166 --> 00:01:05,916
But you can't fight,
you're still hurt...!

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,041
Please, don't do this!

24
00:01:07,125 --> 00:01:07,958
Stay away...

25
00:01:08,041 --> 00:01:09,958
This is my problem to deal with.

26
00:01:10,041 --> 00:01:12,791
I would expect no less of
the Untouchable Queen...

27
00:01:12,875 --> 00:01:14,041
As a reward for your gall,

28
00:01:14,125 --> 00:01:16,375
I shall even let you
choose your opponent.

29
00:01:16,458 --> 00:01:18,291
Arnett, the
"Slashing Trickster,"

30
00:01:18,375 --> 00:01:20,000
ranked fourth in our year...

31
00:01:20,083 --> 00:01:22,750
Or Creo, the "Lightning
Hammer," ranked fifth...

32
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:24,333
Well? Which do you prefer?

33
00:01:24,416 --> 00:01:25,625
To hell with that...

34
00:01:25,708 --> 00:01:28,291
Why don't both of you
come at me at once.

35
00:01:29,791 --> 00:01:31,166
Oh, how exciting...!

36
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:32,791
Now this is a
game worth playing...!

37
00:01:32,875 --> 00:01:34,000
Right, Creo?

38
00:01:34,083 --> 00:01:36,583
Two against one with
an injured opponent?

39
00:01:36,666 --> 00:01:38,875
A stick in the mud
as usual, I see...

40
00:01:38,958 --> 00:01:40,000
Well, whatever...

41
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:41,583
I can take care of her.

42
00:01:41,666 --> 00:01:43,166
There is no need for that...

43
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:46,875
I would be happy to join in and
make the battle two against two.

44
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:48,333
Great...

45
00:01:48,416 --> 00:01:49,500
Sounds like a deal.

46
00:01:49,583 --> 00:01:51,458
I don't need you
butting in on my fight...

47
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:52,583
Stay out of the way.

48
00:01:52,666 --> 00:01:54,083
If you think that
I am doing this

49
00:01:54,166 --> 00:01:55,791
to help you,
then you are wrong...

50
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:57,833
Rather... I am taking
revenge on them,

51
00:01:57,916 --> 00:01:59,958
because they thought
they could deceive me!

52
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:01,875
What are you trying to
accomplish with this...?!

53
00:02:01,958 --> 00:02:03,541
Both of you, stop it!

54
00:02:06,833 --> 00:02:08,458
Kazuya!

55
00:02:08,541 --> 00:02:09,791
My darling!

56
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:12,250
I am going to make
you pay for that!

57
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:48,333
This is strictly a
fight between Pandora...

58
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:51,041
Limiters like him would
only get in the way.

59
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:55,875
Nice try, Second Year...

60
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:58,625
But you won't catch
me off guard again!

61
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:00,916
Volt Weapon: deploy...!

62
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,958
Scythe Machina!

63
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:05,000
Isn't it cute...?

64
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:08,375
Once I get ahold of this,
I just can't control myself!

65
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,458
The way she looked at
Kazuya when he was hurt...

66
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:17,250
Those were not the eyes of
someone who uses other people.

67
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:20,666
Her feelings were no
different than my own...

68
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:28,208
How did she hit me from behind?

69
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:31,625
When her attack
was from the front?

70
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,750
What was that technique?

71
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:35,916
I hate to fight someone
who is already injured...

72
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,250
But somebody needs

73
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:39,083
to teach you underclassmen
a little etiquette...

74
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:40,833
Try not to take
it personally, okay?

75
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:43,291
Do not assume you
shall win so easily.

76
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:45,541
Volt Weapon: Deploy...!

77
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:47,541
Infinity Fang!

78
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,375
I have you now!

79
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:57,916
How primitive.

80
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,250
If you have to power up
before you attack,

81
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:01,833
you're just giving me
more time to counter.

82
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:08,750
Tempest Turn.

83
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:16,208
From three directions at once?!

84
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:20,666
I didn't feel like
dragging this out.

85
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:26,125
Not one to fool
around much are you?

86
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,500
Accelerate!

87
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:39,250
Was that supposed
to be an Acceleration?

88
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:42,583
From the front again?

89
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:44,416
The right!

90
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:51,583
She attacked from four sides...

91
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:53,416
all at the same time.

92
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,166
Can't figure it out, huh...?

93
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,583
Think hard...

94
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:59,625
You've been attacking my
afterimages this whole fight.

95
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:02,750
I thought it was
a simple trick...

96
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:04,916
but she's been
Double Accelerating

97
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,791
right from the start.

98
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:11,375
It's much more advanced
than my technique.

99
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:15,583
Now does it make sense...?

100
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:19,125
We call that little technique
a "Start Double Accel."

101
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:22,708
Shall we go on...?

102
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:24,541
Or will you apologize?

103
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:26,000
I won't lose...

104
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:29,125
Not ever...! I won't let you

105
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:31,666
or anyone else
tell me what to do!

106
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,625
I suppose you
leave me no choice.

107
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:49,875
That sloppy Accelerating Turn
of yours is way too predictable!

108
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:51,625
Why don't I show
you how to do it...

109
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:54,666
I promise it'll be a
lesson you'll never forget!

110
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,125
Too many wave motions...

111
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:02,166
I can't tell where she is...

112
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:12,250
Where is she?

113
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:13,916
I'm right here.

114
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:24,583
Double Acceleration!

115
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:27,166
I'm still waiting
for my apology...

116
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:30,750
Well...? You want me
to slice it out of you?

117
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:34,208
Try it... It'll be the
last thing you ever do.

118
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:36,666
Very well...

119
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:49,291
Hey Creo...

120
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:50,625
I'm all finished if you are.

121
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:52,416
Didn't you go a little too far?

122
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,291
The poor girl...

123
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,333
We have a position
to maintain...

124
00:07:57,416 --> 00:08:00,958
I had to show them what the
upperclassmen are made of.

125
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:03,416
My my, what an eyesore...

126
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,791
But don't worry,
we won't leave you here.

127
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:07,041
Troublesome as you are,

128
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:09,458
you're still quite
valuable to our school...

129
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:11,041
As such, we would
be more than happy

130
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:13,166
to take you over to
the recovery center.

131
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,666
But before that...
tell us you're sorry...

132
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:18,958
You can do that, right?

133
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:20,208
Cat got your tongue?

134
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,375
Don't be shy...

135
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:24,833
I... won't... lose...

136
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:31,833
I won't... kneel... before
you... or anyone else...

137
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:35,208
Creo...! Arnett...!

138
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:38,083
Remove all of her Stigmata
and destroy them...!

139
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:39,750
This girl is beyond our help.

140
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:40,875
Destroy them?!

141
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:41,916
You heard me.

142
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,250
Punishing her is one thing,

143
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:45,875
but that would cause
major mental trauma.

144
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:47,625
I don't really care
what happens to her,

145
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:51,083
but if we destroy her Stigmata
and she's forced to retire...

146
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:52,083
I don't know...

147
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:53,666
We might end up
getting expelled.

148
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,458
It's too late to
worry about that now!

149
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:56,541
Don't you get it...?

150
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:59,041
We've already crossed the line!

151
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:00,375
We're upholding the will forged

152
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:02,750
by the upperclassmen
who came before us!

153
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:03,791
To protect that honor,

154
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:05,708
I will gladly accept
any punishment

155
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,458
the school can dish out!

156
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:09,916
Their legacy is our legacy...!

157
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,583
If you understand that,
you should have no regrets!

158
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:14,958
This is what
Elizabeth wants, too!

159
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:23,083
Satella...
Never give up... Satella!

160
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:26,083
Be strong! Be strong.

161
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:30,000
Satella.

162
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:31,916
Mom...

163
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:37,541
Satella...

164
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:39,875
As of today, this is
going to be our new home...

165
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:41,708
...the el Bridget manor.

166
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:46,166
Welcome to your new home...

167
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,958
Miss Noel Alon-Grache.

168
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:49,666
We've awaited your arrival.

169
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,583
This is the el Bridget Manor...

170
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:55,000
I am Olivia,
lady of the house...

171
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:57,125
Of course, you know
my husband, Howard...

172
00:09:57,208 --> 00:09:58,833
...the head of the family.

173
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:01,166
I... can't thank you enough...

174
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,541
This means so much...

175
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:05,291
Your illness has taken
quite a toll on your body...

176
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:07,291
Frankly, I thought you
would drop dead long

177
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:09,500
before making it here.

178
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:11,041
I shall obey Howard's wishes

179
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:13,166
and allow you to
stay here with us...

180
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,875
But make no mistake...

181
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:17,250
I have no intention of
accepting you as a part

182
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:19,541
of our family so long as I live!

183
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:21,916
Have I made myself clear?

184
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:31,833
Sorry about that,
Miss Alon-Grache.

185
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:33,291
It's a pleasure to
meet you, ma'am...

186
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:35,083
I'm the eldest
daughter of the family,

187
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:37,375
my name is Violet el Bridget.

188
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:38,750
I don't think we've met...

189
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:40,375
Who might you be?

190
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:44,000
Go on... introduce
yourself to the nice lady.

191
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:48,250
I'm... Satellizer...
uh... Alon-Grache...

192
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:49,791
I'm nine years old.

193
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:52,583
Well, isn't that a
beautiful name...!

194
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:54,791
And this is my
little brother, Luis.

195
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:56,208
He's just eight years old...

196
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:58,958
So I guess that makes
you his big sister!

197
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:02,000
It's okay, say hello!

198
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:04,625
That thing is not my sister!

199
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:21,291
Take that! Giddy up, horse...!

200
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:23,666
I don't have all
day you lazy beast!

201
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,916
Come on! Let's see you run!

202
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:28,916
Luis! What are you doing...?

203
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,833
Where did you
learn such a thing?!

204
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:33,583
Apologize to your
sister right now!

205
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:34,833
I'm waiting!

206
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:36,083
That's no sister of mine...!

207
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:37,750
This thing is just my toy!

208
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:39,291
How could you even say that?!

209
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:40,625
What's the big deal?

210
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:43,208
Mom told me I could do
whatever I wanted to her!

211
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:45,541
Oh my god.

212
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:47,041
You would side
with some commoner

213
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:48,708
over your own flesh and blood?

214
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:51,333
This isn't about picking
sides or family or anything...!

215
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:52,916
I'm just worried about her!

216
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,750
Why should you care about that
wretched woman's daughter...?

217
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:58,875
The only thing they're
interested in is our money!

218
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:13,750
You're my toy to play
with whenever I want,

219
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,291
you do know that, right...?

220
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:18,208
You'll do anything I say,
whether you like it or not.

221
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:19,791
Cause if you don't...

222
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:23,000
Then you and your mom won't
be able to stay here anymore...

223
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:24,166
But don't worry...

224
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:27,000
As long as you do
exactly what I tell you,

225
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:28,750
I won't let that happen...

226
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:32,208
You do understand,
right, Satella?

227
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:43,500
Uh... Mom... Can't we
live somewhere else?

228
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:45,541
I don't want to
stay here any more.

229
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:47,291
Where did that come from...?

230
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:48,583
Why would you say that?

231
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:49,708
It's Luis...

232
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:53,833
He does bad things
to me sometimes...

233
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:56,041
He doesn't want me here.

234
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:59,166
When no one is around, he
touches me in strange places.

235
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,541
Don't be silly.

236
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:02,458
Luis is your little brother...

237
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:04,500
He's just trying to
be friendly with you.

238
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:05,916
No! He hates me...!

239
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
He isn't friendly at all...

240
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:11,791
Try to have a
little patience...!

241
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:15,125
If we left here... and
something were to happen to me,

242
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:17,958
you would be on your own!

243
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:20,416
Then what would you do?!

244
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,916
I am suffering enough...

245
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,125
Please don't make it worse.

246
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:38,375
Satella... My little Satella...

247
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:40,250
Such a good girl.

248
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:45,875
Your skin is so
soft and silky...

249
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:48,833
Do you keep it that
way just for me?

250
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,500
No...!

251
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,500
You don't want us to
kick you out, do you?

252
00:13:58,750 --> 00:13:59,958
Don't touch me!

253
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:03,083
I can't stand it
anymore! I can't...

254
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:04,833
What are you doing?!

255
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:09,083
What was that for, Violet?

256
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:10,500
You've got it all wrong!

257
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,000
We were just having fun!

258
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:14,000
It's nothing to get mad about!

259
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:16,833
We were just playing, that's all

260
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:25,250
Satella... I don't
know how to say this...

261
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:26,958
I don't blame you

262
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:29,833
and I know you haven't
done anything wrong...

263
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:33,208
But I think it would be best if
you left this house for a while.

264
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:35,583
It's what's best for everybody.

265
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:42,458
Satellizer...!
I have some bad news.

266
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:44,250
Your mother isn't well!

267
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:49,750
I'm here!

268
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:06,666
I'm sorry... Satella...

269
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:10,041
I'm trying...

270
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:13,750
I'm doing everything the el
Bridget family tells me to do.

271
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:15,958
I'm as patient as I can be...

272
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:18,375
I'll put up with
anything, I promise...!

273
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:20,125
Just please don't die!

274
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:23,875
Please, Mom!
Promise me you won't die!

275
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:25,416
Satella...

276
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,916
You... won't have to put up
with these terrible things...

277
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,750
...much longer...

278
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:32,500
Mom, no...

279
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:35,750
From now on, you have to
be stronger than anyone...

280
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:38,708
You can't ever give in.

281
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:40,666
Be proud of who you are...

282
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:44,875
Don't lose yourself...
and don't lose to anyone else.

283
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:46,583
Never give up, Satella.

284
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:49,750
Be strong... Be strong...

285
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:56,916
Call the doctor!

286
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:57,583
Bring the paddles!

287
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:59,625
Quick! Hurry!

288
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:13,833
I told you...

289
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:17,708
I won't lose...
I won't kneel to you...

290
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:20,916
...not today... not ever.

291
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
No way...

292
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:24,208
Her injuries are all healing...

293
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:34,833
Wings of light... just like
the transfer student...!

294
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:36,708
What's going on here?!

295
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:39,166
I've never seen this,
what's going on?

296
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,666
Damn it! Look out!

297
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:49,750
A Start Double Accel?!

298
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:51,166
Arnett, no!!

299
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:55,416
Maybe you should
worry about yourself first!

300
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,500
Creo!

301
00:16:57,583 --> 00:17:00,458
You would do well to pay
more attention to your opponent!

302
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:01,666
Try to keep up...

303
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,750
From here on out...
I will not hold back!

304
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:12,125
She wasn't this
strong before, was she?!

305
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:14,458
How is she keeping
up with Arnett?!

306
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:20,250
Those dead eyes...
she's just acting on instinct!

307
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:22,541
You might've
copied my technique,

308
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,625
but you're not faster than me!

309
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:29,458
I couldn't follow her at all...!

310
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:31,250
How is she quicker than me?!

311
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:38,375
What is this...
a Triple Accel...?!

312
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:46,791
She totally eclipsed
my Acceleration...

313
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:54,083
Arnett lost to an
underclassman?!

314
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:55,666
If you fail to understand

315
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,666
how a second year
can defeat a third year,

316
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,291
then I would be more
than happy to show you.

317
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:01,208
Mock me, will you?!

318
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:02,833
This time I won't hold back!

319
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:05,916
You already used that technique
a moment ago, did you not?

320
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:08,875
Whoa!

321
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:10,583
There's four of her?!

322
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:13,625
Enga!

323
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:23,166
No... Impossible...!

324
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:26,666
Not Creo too!
This is a nightmare!

325
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:32,375
Opening the Sacred Gate
is a double-edged sword...

326
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:35,125
I should have known
my replication technique

327
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:36,458
would have repercussions.

328
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:37,875
And her...

329
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:39,208
How did she open the gate so far

330
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:41,666
when she hasn't
even been trained?

331
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:44,458
She is a fearsome woman, indeed.

332
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,875
You probably should
not push yourself.

333
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:53,958
We've gone this far...

334
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:55,791
They're way past their limits...

335
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:58,625
I guess it's up to me
to put an end to this...

336
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:04,041
This is our fight,
Attia... Butt out.

337
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:06,833
Yeah, I still have a score
to settle, after all...

338
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:09,041
Things are just
starting to heat up!

339
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:11,041
Once, I made the
mistake of trying

340
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:12,625
to reason with these fools,

341
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:16,166
but it looks like the only thing
they understand is violence.

342
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:21,416
Your boundless tenacity is
admirable... dear upperclassmen!

343
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,541
Stop right there!

344
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:24,833
Miss Chiffon...!

345
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:26,208
What are you doing here?

346
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:28,583
Pandora are strictly
forbidden to fight one another,

347
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:30,875
regardless of the reason,
don't try to tell me

348
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:33,375
that you aren't aware
of the school rules.

349
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:35,333
You and I can chat
about rules and etiquette

350
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:36,958
and all that crap later,

351
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:39,916
but right now, I'm gonna
beat them to a bloody pulp!

352
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,583
That's enough!

353
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,208
No...! Damn it,
Ticy, not you too!

354
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:47,208
Don't disobey the president...

355
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:49,958
Knock it off now.

356
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:52,291
If you get in my way,
you're gonna get cut!

357
00:19:57,458 --> 00:20:00,166
Sorry... but I really
have to insist.

358
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,625
What... the hell was that...?

359
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:05,041
She was so fast,
I didn't even see her move!

360
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:08,583
One attack and Arnett
was finished...

361
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:10,958
Chiffon's Illusion Turn
is unstoppable.

362
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:13,875
No wonder she's
first in our year.

363
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:14,958
So, what now...?

364
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:17,333
Do you still want
to continue this?

365
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:22,500
All right, I give up.

366
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:34,958
Satellizer...
Please take Kazuya

367
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:37,750
to the nurse's office
as soon as you can, okay?

368
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:39,250
Oh, do not worry,
Miss Chiffon...!

369
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:40,458
I will make certain

370
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:41,875
that he arrives there
with maximum haste!

371
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:43,958
Oh... very well, then--

372
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:46,708
just as long as
he's taken care of.

373
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:49,083
I will not let you
down, ma'am...!

374
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:52,500
Now, where did he run off to?

375
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:53,666
Come back here!

376
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:56,208
I said I would take care of him!

377
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:57,833
He's my partner...

378
00:20:57,916 --> 00:21:00,416
and this is the least I can do.

379
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:10,333
Sorry for disturbing
your swim...

380
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:13,041
but I have a little
bit of news for you.

381
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:16,333
Is that so, Miss Fairchild?

382
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:19,000
If this is in regard to
the Untouchable Queen...

383
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:21,708
I'll warn you, I don't
intend to back down.

384
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:23,750
Then I suppose it won't
do any good to mention

385
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:24,833
that she just defeated

386
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:27,083
the fourth-ranked girl
from our year.

387
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:28,000
Rather sad...

388
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:29,291
Thanks to her, the third years

389
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:32,583
have really had to
swallow their pride lately.

390
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:41,291
We can't simply think
of her as a second year...

391
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:44,458
Satellizer may be one of
the strongest Pandora here.

392
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:46,291
Perhaps you should
keep that fact in mind

393
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:49,708
the next time to try
to tell her what to do.

394
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:52,375
I mean that you can't
rely on strength alone

395
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:55,166
if you're hoping to
make progress with her...

396
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:59,416
Well, at any rate,
that's all I wanted to tell you.

397
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:04,083
I'm reminded of something
Sister Margaret said...

398
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:05,625
"It may not be long

399
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:09,708
before these peaceful days
of ours come to an end."

400
00:23:41,125 --> 00:23:42,708
I've come here to
challenge you to a duel!

401
00:23:42,791 --> 00:23:43,916
Satellizer...?

402
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,458
Are you taking part
in this event as well?

403
00:23:45,541 --> 00:23:46,875
I don't think I can do this...

404
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:48,541
It's all so humiliating!

405
00:23:48,625 --> 00:23:50,833
Next time: "Pandora Queen."
