161
00:11:58,291 --> 00:11:59,916
[CHIFFON] Rumor has it,
they've been developing

162
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
these Nova dummies
here in Alaska.

163
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:04,333
[ELIZABETH] If you look
at this whole ordeal

164
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:05,708
as basically a test run,

165
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:08,916
it makes sense they would
be so overly prepared.

166
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,041
That's standard test procedure.

167
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:12,750
[SATELLIZER] So, you're saying
they went to all this trouble

168
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:15,125
to send us down here,
keep us completely in the dark,

169
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:18,166
and fake a distress call just
to involve us in an exercise?

170
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,750
Actually, Elizabeth
and I were told

171
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:21,708
this thing was related
to disaster relief.

172
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:22,875
[SATELLIZER sighs]

173
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:24,875
Whatever the reason,
this much is clear.

174
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:27,208
Somebody's trying to test us.

175
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:30,750
And my gut tells me this
was only the beginning.

176
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:35,250
Kindly avert your eyes!

177
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:36,708
[SATELLIZER]
Huh? Aah!

178
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:38,041
[CHIFFON chuckles]

179
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:39,500
[CHIFFON] You could always
use your Volt Texture

180
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:41,708
to cover yourself up, ya know?

181
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:47,750
[RANA]
Kazuya, are you in pain?

182
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,250
[KAZUYA] Huh?

183
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:51,291
[RANA] Miss Satellizer all but
accosted you, did she not?

184
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:52,750
[KAZUYA]
You're overreacting, Rana.

185
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:55,083
No, I am only concerned
for your well-being.

186
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:58,375
Besides, is it not my duty
given that you are my Limiter?

187
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:00,958
Wait a second, since when
is Kazuya your Limiter?

188
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:02,708
He's already mine!

189
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:04,791
I was under the impression
you have yet to hold

190
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:07,666
a baptism with Kazuya therefore
rendering your claim obsolete.

191
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,791
But--

192
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:12,083
She is conceited,
pious and quite prudish

193
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,750
when it comes to contact
of the physical variety.

194
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:17,041
As a result, I believe she
would be far more effective

195
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:18,166
in the role of a helper.

196
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:21,250
Ah! What?!
A helper? Get real!

197
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:22,083
Aah!

198
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:23,291
[CHIFFON giggles]

199
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:25,208
Will you please stop
acting like children?!

200
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:26,416
Yes, ma'am.

201
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,250
Seriously, this is no
time to joke around;

202
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:29,791
we're here to help
the E-Pandora Lab

203
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:32,083
by providing them with
critical info, remember?

204
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:34,166
[RANA] Yes, I suppose
you are correct.

205
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:37,166
Wait, what is an E-Pandora?

206
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:40,416
[SATELLIZER] E-Pandora are
artificial Pandora.

207
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:44,083
[FEMALE NEWSCASTER] As directly
evidenced in the recent

208
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:47,333
Tenth Nova Clash, these Nova
appearances are widespread,

209
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:50,041
becoming more and more frequent
with each new occurrence.

210
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:51,541
In an attempt
to counter this,

211
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:53,416
Chevalier General Command
has just announced

212
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,083
its adoption of a brand new
Pandora initiative.

213
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:58,750
Doctor Scarlet Ohara spearheads
this cutting edge effort

214
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:00,583
known as the E-Pandora Project.

215
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:02,125
Upon turning
eleven years old,

216
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:05,125
all girls are now required to
take a Pandora aptitude test

217
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:07,083
to determine their ability.

218
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:09,208
In the past, only
those girls who possess

219
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:11,375
a certain level of
Stigmata-compatibility

220
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:13,125
were allowed to live as Pandora.

221
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:14,750
Of course, those
who meet the standards

222
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:16,500
have always been free
to accept or decline

223
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:18,041
the offer to become Pandora.

224
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:20,500
However, there are those
girls who want to fight

225
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:23,083
but aren't allowed due to
incompatibility issues.

226
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:25,791
These girls will finally
have their chance.

227
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:27,416
Regardless of
previous standards,

228
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,833
the E-Pandora Project allows
ordinary, incompatible girls

229
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:33,833
to become Pandora by implanting
artificially created Stigmata.

230
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:36,708
[RANA] Trust in me Kazuya,
the taste is a Kunlun Harmony

231
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:38,458
of fragrant flavors
that bursts in your mouth!

232
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:39,750
The pasta place
makes this?

233
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:41,333
Yes!

234
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:43,458
I shall take you there soon so
you may see with your own eyes!

235
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:44,916
 ...persistently
opposed the project,

236
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,958
citing, among other things,
its unethical nature.

237
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:49,375
[FEMALE REPORTER]
Doctor Aoi! Can you tell us

238
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:52,083
how you really feel about
the E-Pandora Project?

239
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:54,500
Considering the project's
been given the green light,

240
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:57,333
I don't see how my personal
feelings are of any consequence.

241
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:58,875
[FEMALE NEWSCASTER]
But the real question remains:

242
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:00,125
if this project works,

243
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:02,833
can we actually call
these girls "Pandora"?

244
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:05,291
[KAZUYA] I wonder why
he's not speaking his mind.

245
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:06,458
[FEMALE NEWSCASTER]
Onto other news,

246
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:08,000
Seiga Heavy Industries
was the center...

247
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:10,500
[ELIZABETH] In my view,
artificial or not.

248
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:14,208
A Pandora's a Pandora,
plain and simple.

249
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:16,000
[ELIZABETH] I assume there
will be those who volunteer

250
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:18,166
to become E-Pandora
simply for the status

251
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:21,166
they'll be guaranteed
after their tour of duty.

252
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,125
But as it is now.

253
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:25,625
Less than two percent
of girls verified to be

254
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:29,666
Stigmata-compatible go on
to become Pandora anyway.

255
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:32,750
It's a dangerous occupation
and everyone knows it.

256
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:34,625
Countless Pandora
have lost their lives

257
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:36,166
fighting against the Nova.

258
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,916
Fact is, we need more help.

259
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
And given the circumstances.

260
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:44,166
I think it would be a mistake
to reject Pandora volunteers

261
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,041
strictly because they
happen to be the product

262
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:48,166
of some experiment.

263
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,666
Our ranks are thinning.

264
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:52,083
We have a worldwide
shortage of Pandora.

265
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:55,333
This may be the key to
solving that problem.

266
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:58,708
You really believe that?

267
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:04,541
Ah! It appears
we have arrived!

268
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:07,500
The laboratory is
straight ahead!

269
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:34,416
[KAZUYA] Looks like
this place used to be

270
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,208
some kind of industrial plant.

271
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:38,833
And the perfect location to
keep a secret covered-up,

272
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:39,708
don't you think?

273
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,125
[KAZUYA] Huh?

274
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,083
[CHIFFON] Don't mind me!
I'm just kidding!

275
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:44,416
[KAZUYA]
Yeah, thought so.

we will install Volt Texture
data into each of you.

[RANA] Did she say
"Volt Texture data"?

287
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:35,875
[ELIZABETH] It's probably
customized for this facility.

[CHIFFON] Feel that?

These cold protection and
heat retention capabilities

00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:42,208
The infamous Charles Bonaparte
of Genetics France, LDT.

317
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:46,250
Also known as the
Young Tempest Phoenix.

318
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:47,250
[CATHY] Satellizer!

319
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:48,000
[SATELLIZER gasps]

320
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:50,625
[CATHY giggles]

321
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:52,708
[CATHY] I was hoping
I'd see you here!

322
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:53,833
Cathy Lockharte!

323
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:55,666
[RANA] Ah! It is her!

324
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,291
She is the Godspeed
of the East who did

325
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:59,666
mighty combat as the
lesbian nude cheetah!

326
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,083
[CATHY] Lesbian?

327
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:04,583
Oh, don't listen to her.
She's a bit on the slow side.

328
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,125
[CATHY yells]

329
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:10,333
Supple with a perfect mix
of firmness and bounciness;

330
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:12,583
if I were to make a guess
I would say at the smallest,

331
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:13,791
she's a D.

332
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:16,166
What are you,
like a boobologist?

333
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:19,291
This girl is the one
and only Julia Munberk.

334
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:20,916
Genetics Germany, Panzer.

335
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,875
Also known as the
Maverick of Walpurgis.

336
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:26,250
[PANDORA 1A] Guys, look!
It's the Fabulous Five!

337
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:27,416
[chattering]

338
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,708
Well, she's right.
They are nice.

339
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:30,708
[SATELLIZER]
What's the Fabulous Five?

340
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:32,000
[ELIZABETH]
You don't know?

341
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:34,083
Those four ladies,
along with Chiffon here

342
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:36,375
just happen to be the
five most highly ranking

343
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:38,916
third-year Genetics
members in the world.

344
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,625
Don't sell your talent
short, Elizabeth,

345
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:42,041
you're just behind
them in ranking.

346
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:43,291
[ELIZABETH]
For now at least.

347
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:45,583
I'll be fighting a
pretty tough opponent.

348
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:48,916
Holly Rose of
Genetics Britain, UK.

349
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,500
Speaking of,
I'm a bit surprised

350
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:51,916
she hasn't shown her face.

351
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,583
Yeah, it's not really like
her to be late to a party.

352
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:56,500
[FEMALE ANNOUNCEMENT]
Attention, all Pandora.

353
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:58,916
Please conduct your
Volt Texture equipping tests

354
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,583
in the designated fitting rooms.

355
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:04,541
Also, in the event you should
encounter any equipping errors,

356
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:05,625
please report them...

357
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:07,791
Volt Texture! Equip now!

358
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:14,666
Yep. Fits like a glove.

359
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,708
I don't know, I think
I like it better naked.

360
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:19,583
Oh well, Volt Texture
Equip, I suppose.

361
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:26,166
Sexy.

362
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:28,166
Much like you,

363
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:29,791
your undergarments
are lacking in taste.

364
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:31,291
Hey!

365
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:33,083
Satellizer! Have you changed
into your new garments yet?

366
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:34,541
It feels quite delightful!

367
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:35,541
[SATELLIZER yells]

368
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:37,666
Oh, suck it up,
first-year.

369
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:38,875
[RANA gasps]

370
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:40,375
[SATELLIZER]
There's no way I can wear this.

371
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:42,208
It's so short!

372
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:53,666
My name is Scarlet Ohara,

373
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:56,000
and I am the head of
the E-Pandora Project.

374
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:59,541
The purpose of this
initiative is quite simple.

375
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:02,583
But the benefits we will
gain are immeasurable.

376
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:04,791
Our goal is to
artificially produce

377
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:07,041
Stigmata-compatible
subjects.

378
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:09,375
In order to successfully
complete this endeavor,

379
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:12,958
I will need data from you,
the original Pandora.

380
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:14,666
This will be a game changer.

381
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,625
Thanks to the data
we obtain from you,

382
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:19,708
we will no longer have to
rely on the extreme rarity

383
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:22,625
of naturally occurring
Pandora compatibility.

384
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:27,875
The days of you carrying
this burden alone are over.

385
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:31,416
The time has come for all
girls to help carry the load!

386
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:36,791
[gasps and applause]

387
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:39,833
[ROXANNE] Something doesn't
feel right about this.

388
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:42,125
As far as I can tell,
Doctor Gengo Aoi

389
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:45,500
is still opposed to them pushing
this E-Pandora project forward.

390
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:47,666
Not to mention they were
basically already done with it

391
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,625
before they ever got
permission from Chevalier

392
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:52,500
to move forward
in the first place.

393
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:54,541
Seems to me somebody's
been havin' a field day

394
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:55,958
with human experiments.

you'd like to say?

[SATELLIZER gasps]

know who the heck you are.

been cookin' up down here.
