[Music]

2
00:01:38,375 --> 00:01:40,416
I'm Takumi Nishijo.

3
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,083
Yua confronted me at
the internet cafe...

4
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:45,041
She told me
that I had DID,

5
00:01:45,125 --> 00:01:47,500
or multiple
personality disorder,

6
00:01:47,583 --> 00:01:49,458
and that a different
aspect of my personality

7
00:01:49,541 --> 00:01:51,291
was the murderer.

8
00:01:51,375 --> 00:01:53,583
I tried to run, but it
wasn't just Yua chasing me.

9
00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:55,791
Police officers were
hot on my trail too...

10
00:01:57,458 --> 00:01:59,750
That's when Ayase
came to my rescue.

11
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:02,208
Apparently she was
a suspect too...

12
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:04,625
'Cause her song
predicted the staking...

13
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:07,375
Together, Ayase and I
ran from the police...

14
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:08,458
Once we had lost them,

15
00:02:08,541 --> 00:02:10,375
she showed me
something incredible.

16
00:02:10,458 --> 00:02:14,208
She pulled a real di-sword
out of empty space.

17
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:16,166
Then, inexplicably,

18
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,375
another Ayase appeared
right in front of me...

19
00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:22,208
It was a version of her
from a delusion I had before.

20
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:24,458
Delusions becoming real...

21
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:25,916
When I got back
to home base,

22
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,708
I saw an online video of
the first New Gen incident,

23
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:30,708
known as the "Group Dive"...

24
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:32,041
I heard a familiar sound

25
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:33,916
and I knew who shot
the footage...

26
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,375
It was the General.

27
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:40,166
We now know that the phrase

28
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,500
"Those eyes, whose are they?"

29
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:43,500
the famous dying message
from the Vampire incident,

30
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:45,500
was spoken by a
member of the Group Dive...

31
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:47,500
What this means is that
all four incidents

32
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:50,291
might have been the work of a
single criminal mastermind...

33
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:52,125
Police know where the
video was posted...

34
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:54,666
It happened at a
local internet café...

35
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,916
Although they can't be
certain who's responsible,

36
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,166
authorities say
their investigation

37
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,125
is generating
some good leads.

38
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:06,541
It doesn't
make any sense.

39
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:09,708
Why would the General bother
uploading that video...?

40
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:11,625
Is he trying to provoke me?

41
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:13,041
The time is here...

42
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:15,000
Awaken...! Now...!

43
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:18,583
If you don't, many
people are going to die.

44
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:20,208
Be strong.

45
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:22,625
No matter what...
You can't give up.

46
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:23,875
Yeah right...

47
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:25,666
That's basically a threat.

48
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,583
"You can give up and
run away if you want,

49
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,500
but if you do,
I'm going to kill you."...

50
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:32,291
I have to find my
di-sword, and fast...!

51
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:34,708
Di-sword?

52
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:35,791
But I still don't know,

53
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:38,375
how the hell am I
supposed to get one?

54
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:40,166
You are the only
one who can find it,

55
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,625
you must do it alone.

56
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:44,500
This is too much, I
didn't even get a hint!

57
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:45,875
And what about Rimi?

58
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:47,666
I can't figure her out...

59
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:48,916
Is she on my side?

60
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,791
It's called
visual rebuilding.

61
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:52,541
Individuals who have been
blind since birth

62
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:54,208
are given the ability
of seeing again.

63
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:55,916
It's achieved with
the use of a device

64
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,583
similar to a video camera.

65
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:00,375
What if you reverse that?

66
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:02,208
You might possibly
be able to change

67
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:04,625
what you're thinking
into electronic signals,

68
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:07,041
send your thoughts to a
video recording device,

69
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:09,083
and convert that
information into data.

70
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,375
For example, if you
sent a mental image

71
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:14,333
of what person A is thinking
to a hard disc recorder

72
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:16,208
and turned it into
a video recording,

73
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:18,291
and then somehow
transmitted that information

74
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:20,041
to person B's brain,

75
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:22,166
that would mean that
person A's mental delusion

76
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,791
would become
person B's reality...

77
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:27,541
Your thoughts...
become part of the world.

78
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:29,666
Maybe that's the answer
I've been looking for,

79
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,916
maybe that's how
I'll get my di-sword.

80
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:49,541
Somebody, please, help me.

81
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:56,291
You're okay...

82
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:58,041
Don't worry about a thing.

83
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:01,666
Everything's all right,
because I'm on your side.

84
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,166
I'm so scared...

85
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,041
I'm afraid to be alone...

86
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:06,541
I don't know what to do.

87
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:09,041
All right... How 'bout
I stay with you then?

88
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:13,541
Sure, it's impossible for
me to be with you 24/7

89
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:16,000
but still...

90
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:18,583
We can meet up in the
morning if you'd like to...

91
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:21,666
And on the way to school we
can gossip about everybody...

92
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:24,333
Of course we can always sit
with each other at lunchtime...

93
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:26,250
We can walk home
after class too...

94
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:27,375
And every once in a while

95
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:28,833
it might be fun to
go shopping together

96
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:30,375
at the anime store...

97
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:32,083
I'll be there
when you need me.

98
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:33,541
If you think that
will help you...

99
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,250
then I'd be
happy to do it...

100
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:36,541
'Cause honestly...

101
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:38,583
I had been hoping
I could help!

102
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:41,458
It's almost like
we'd be lovers.

103
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,000
What do you think, Taku?

104
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:46,000
But... well, how come?

105
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:47,375
Why would you go
out of your way

106
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:50,000
and sacrifice so
much just for me?

107
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,166
Well I...

108
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:55,333
Ten-hut!

109
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:58,250
'Cause you're my best friend
and it's my responsibility...!

110
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:00,458
No more asking sad
questions like 'Why?'...

111
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:01,458
You got it?

112
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:04,625
Let's go home.

113
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:10,500
It's all right...
The coast is clear.

114
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,166
I hope you don't
mind me asking...

115
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,916
But what exactly happened?

116
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:23,875
An old man in
a wheelchair?

117
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:25,833
Are you sure that's
what you saw?

118
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:27,541
I'm absolutely sure...

119
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:29,250
You didn't see
anyone like that?

120
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:30,250
No...

121
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:31,708
I don't think so.

122
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:34,208
You remembered the intersection
being empty, right...?

123
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:35,541
But it was crowded...

124
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:37,375
Just like it usually is.

125
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:38,875
Down with these demons!

126
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:41,166
Everything happened
really fast...

127
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,625
Plus there were so
many people there,

128
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:45,000
I might not have noticed
someone in a wheelchair...

129
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:46,875
But I'm pretty sure
I didn't see him.

130
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:49,041
I'm really sorry.

131
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:50,708
I wish I could
help you out.

132
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:51,916
At the very least,

133
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I'm certain it wasn't
another delusion...

134
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:56,666
The General is real
and I saw him...

135
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,458
But maybe my
delusion was Shibuya

136
00:06:58,541 --> 00:07:00,166
being completely deserted.

137
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,000
Hey, what's wrong?

138
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:05,583
Destroy these demons!

139
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:07,541
Taku?

140
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:09,500
What is it?

141
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:11,833
Drive back the demons!

142
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:14,541
What kind of
protest is this?

143
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:16,833
Destroy these demons!

144
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:18,875
Taku, what's the
matter with you?

145
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:20,666
Drive back the demons!

146
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,625
Drive back the demons!

147
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:25,500
Destroy these demons!

148
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:28,291
Demons?

149
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:30,750
Drive back the demons!

150
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:32,458
Drive back the demons!

151
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,833
Delicious!

152
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:43,541
You're into Phantasm too?

153
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:46,166
Everyone's talking about
'em these days, aren't they?

154
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:50,666
She said it was possible

155
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:53,458
to make a video out of
something that's in my mind...

156
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:54,666
But how?

157
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:57,875
Taku, what exactly
are you doing, huh?

158
00:07:57,958 --> 00:07:59,583
Oh come on,
this is no fun.

159
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:01,416
-Tell me what you're up to?
-Here.

160
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,416
Lemme see.

00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:12,291
as images and audio data."

165
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:14,708
That's it. It's exactly what
I've been looking for!

166
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:16,875
I don't understand,
what's the big deal?

167
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:18,333
Um, well...

168
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:20,416
Put simply, this is a
patent for new technology...

169
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,416
It records footage
of people's thoughts.

170
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,541
In other words, you can
use a special device

171
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:26,125
to look in on the
sound and images

172
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:28,416
a person is thinking
in their subconscious,

173
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,250
without them ever
knowing about it.

174
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:32,791
"Secret footage of other
people's thoughts"...?

175
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:34,708
Is something like
that possible?

176
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:36,583
After I saw that...

177
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:38,125
it just hit me.

178
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:40,375
The power to make a
delusion reality...?

179
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:42,875
To make someone's
thoughts come to life...?

180
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,375
No, no...

181
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:46,333
Even if there is some sort
of scientific system

182
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:49,125
which makes it possible to
convert thoughts into images,

183
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:52,750
to think I might have
supernatural powers is insane!

184
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:55,458
But what if it's not.

185
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:58,541
What if that's the only
way to get a di-sword...?

186
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:01,291
What if I have to unleash a
special power from within me?

187
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:08,166
Is it as easy as that?

188
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,333
I just have to picture
a sword in my mind...?

189
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,416
Will it appear in my hand?

190
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,916
Stop it!

191
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:23,291
Um, I, uh...

192
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:25,416
Taku... About that sword...

193
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,291
Huh?

194
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:27,291
Just forget it...

195
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:28,625
Please throw it away.

196
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:30,208
But why...? What for?

197
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:32,416
'Cause... You're not
a little kid anymore!

198
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,875
Huh?

199
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:35,916
Sure, I can understand how
men love that kind of toy

200
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,583
regardless of
how old they are,

201
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:39,500
but can you imagine
what someone would think

202
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,833
if they saw you swinging that
thing around all by yourself?

203
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:43,166
Think what they'd say?

204
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:46,708
Man, that scared me.

205
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:49,250
I don't get it,
are they popular?

206
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:50,541
Just wondering...

207
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:52,708
Seems like an unusual
thing for someone to buy.

208
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:54,875
Well, this is just an
imitation actually

209
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:56,375
but real ones are out there.

210
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:57,625
Real ones?

211
00:09:57,708 --> 00:09:59,541
Oh yeah, I know people
who have them...

212
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:01,000
I saw their di-swords...

213
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:03,166
Two girls actually, they
both go to school with us.

214
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:06,083
No, I'm serious...

215
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:08,041
These things exist,
they're not toys!

216
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:13,416
You know it's against the
law to carry swords, right?

217
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,500
Who are these girls...?

218
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:16,708
And how do you know them?

219
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:18,250
She smells nice.

220
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:20,166
Well, they're not your
girlfriends, are they?

221
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:24,958
Okay, that makes me
feel a little better.

222
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:30,708
I can't believe it...!

223
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:31,791
I don't know what to say.

224
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:34,958
How am I supposed
to respond to this?

225
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:37,958
But... I'm still curious,
who are they?

226
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,666
Well, I don't know, I...

227
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:44,375
Is something the matter?

228
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:46,291
Is... Is this a delusion?

229
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:47,666
Um...

230
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,458
-Taku.
-Uh, yes?

231
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:50,500
I'm thirsty...

232
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:51,708
Not to be a bother,

233
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:53,375
but do you have anything
to drink, by chance?

234
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:55,666
Uh, yeah...
There's soda.

235
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,291
Ooh... Fresh squeezed
juice would be nice...

236
00:10:58,375 --> 00:10:59,500
I'll be right back.

237
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:03,041
See you soon!

238
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:05,916
No way...! Rimi, you're
an exhibitionist?!

239
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,458
What's that?

240
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,000
Geez, Taku, you scared me.

241
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:10,500
What was that all about?!

242
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,791
You were acting
really strange.

243
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:15,375
First you started
mumbling to yourself,

244
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:17,500
then out of nowhere you
started screaming...

245
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:18,416
What's wrong?

246
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,125
Uh, I'm fine,
it's nothing.

247
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:22,125
Weird, there's
not even any soda.

248
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:23,375
Huh?

249
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:25,625
I'm thirsty. I think
I'll go buy something...

250
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:26,708
Be back in a minute.

251
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:27,958
Sure.

252
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:33,583
I guess that means the erotic
Rimi wasn't real after all,

253
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:35,583
just another delusion...

254
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:37,291
But still.

255
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:39,250
The erotic Rimi.

256
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:41,583
Both of the Ayases.

257
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:42,833
What exactly was it

258
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:45,166
that made both of them
feel so real to me...?

259
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,125
And how was I able
to reproduce them?

260
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:55,916
What is this
"new info", huh?

261
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,625
Again?

262
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:03,333
Hold on!

263
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:06,541
The internet café has already
given this event a name?

264
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:07,500
"Brainless".

265
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:11,583
What's this?

266
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:14,041
The victim's a psychiatrist?

267
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:15,541
"On the streets of Shibuya,

268
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:17,791
just before dawn
on the 23rd...

269
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:22,750
a psychiatrist from AH Tokyo
General Hospital was killed.

270
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:24,875
"I can't believe this.

271
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:26,750
It's Dr. Takashina...!

272
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:28,875
Dr. Takashina was murdered?!

273
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:30,541
This is aimed at me...

274
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,458
The General is clearly
trying to provoke me,

275
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:33,583
I know it!

276
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,916
Help me!

277
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,208
Somebody save me!

278
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:40,041
Help me, please!

279
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:41,458
No...! No!

280
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:43,458
No...! No...! No!

281
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:46,250
Help me...! Help me!

282
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:47,458
Oh please... Save me...

283
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:49,916
Rimi... Rimi!

284
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:53,000
No... She's gone!

285
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:54,458
Where is she?!

286
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,500
Where did she go...?

287
00:12:57,583 --> 00:12:59,541
Rimi save me...

288
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:02,375
Don't leave me alone like this,
please, I'm begging you!

289
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:03,625
Taku.

290
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:08,500
I'm back now.

291
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:10,041
Rimi.

292
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:16,500
You're back.

293
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:18,500
I'm right here.

294
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:19,750
Don't worry...

295
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:22,500
There's no reason
for you to be afraid.

296
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:23,541
Thank you.

297
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:27,833
It's my pleasure.

298
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:29,291
Right now...

299
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:32,583
she's the only thing keeping
my spirit from breaking.

300
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:35,708
If it weren't for her I'd
go completely insane...

301
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:38,208
I want to hold onto
these hands forever.

302
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,916
Hey... Who the hell are you?

303
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,750
I'll ask the
questions here.

304
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:11,875
You're not one of us...

305
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:13,125
Get lost!

306
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:14,500
Where's Hatano?

307
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:15,833
Hatano...?

308
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:17,958
Sorry I don't
know that guy...

309
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:20,166
and I wouldn't tell you anything
even if I did know him.

310
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,541
Hey, what's your problem?

311
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:23,250
I'm so sorry...

312
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:25,416
It just slipped
right out of my hand.

313
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:31,208
Now hold on...

314
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:32,583
I swear to you,
I wasn't lying,

315
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:34,291
I don't know who that
person is, I promise!

316
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:36,750
Oh, don't worry,
I believe you.

317
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:38,875
But whether you
know him or not...

318
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:40,625
I'll destroy
it regardless.

319
00:14:58,583 --> 00:14:59,708
Nozomi.

320
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:12,708
The power to make my
thoughts reality...

321
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:16,375
What if I've had that
ability my entire life...?

322
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:18,583
That day I wasn't able to
go on the field trip...

323
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:21,000
What if everything that
happened back then was reality

324
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:23,041
reflecting my imagination?

325
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:26,416
If that's the
case, then I...

326
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,083
Morning...!
I came to get you!

327
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:31,583
Why do you keep spacing
out like that...?

328
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:33,708
I told you yesterday that I
was gonna come and get you...

329
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:35,291
What did you think?

330
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:38,083
I was gonna stand up my
favorite person in the world?

331
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:39,500
Not a chance...!

332
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:41,041
Ten-hut, Taku...!

333
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:43,208
I'm not the type of person
who goes back on her word!

334
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:47,208
You know...
I've been wondering

335
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:50,125
why winter skies are
so grey and faded...

336
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:51,041
I bet it's because
the cold weather

337
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:52,375
makes everyone depressed,

338
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:54,250
so fewer people wish
for blue skies...

339
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:55,458
Do you think?

340
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:57,125
It's strange,

341
00:15:57,208 --> 00:16:00,833
but I feel like I've had this
conversation with Rimi before.

342
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:03,541
So even if it's freezing,
let's keep our spirits up.

343
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:08,375
Takumi.

344
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:13,666
I hope the cops
haven't bothered you.

345
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,125
You must find
your sword...

346
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:17,000
You don't have any other
choice but to do so.

347
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:19,666
Give me a hint please...

348
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:20,916
I just need a
little guidance.

349
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,125
How'd you manage
to get yours?

350
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:25,125
It was there before
I ever realized it.

351
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:27,625
I didn't know what
had happened at first.

352
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:30,166
Once I changed my
perspective, I understood.

353
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,875
It's possible that your
mind is already ready

354
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:33,000
and willing to see it...

355
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:35,291
but you are too
afraid to look.

356
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:36,291
Yeah, but...

357
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:37,666
I've been looking
everywhere...

358
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,083
and I'm not afraid...

359
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:40,958
I swear I'm ready for this.

360
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:48,125
Hey, Taku!

361
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:50,333
Tell me... How'd you
pull that off...?

362
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:53,083
What gives? I didn't realize
you two were close...

363
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:55,791
That's the first time I've
ever seen her talk to anyone...

364
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:57,208
It's time to fess up...!

365
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:59,333
What did you do to make
her fall for you...?!

366
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:00,500
Come on man,
I'm not kidding!

367
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:01,875
Stop it!

368
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:02,833
Why don't you just relax?

369
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:04,208
You're bothering Taku!

370
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:07,833
Actually, he's the
one bothering me!

371
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:09,916
So... Time to spill
the beans, my friend...

372
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,333
What exactly did
you do, Taku?

373
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:14,208
Tell me!

374
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:16,041
I wish they
wouldn't look at me.

375
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:24,250
You know, I never thought
you would be so popular.

376
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:25,416
What?

377
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,250
Oh come on, you haven't
noticed yet...?

378
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:29,625
Weren't you hanging out with a
pretty third year with glasses

379
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:31,083
or was that just
my imagination?

380
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:32,375
Well, she was...

381
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:33,916
Yeah... You already told me...

382
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,166
She was really mean to
you or something, right...?

383
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:39,583
Oh yeah and today you were
chatting with that Ayase girl.

384
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:41,541
And then there's
Kozue, too...

385
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:42,750
She said something to you

386
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:44,458
on her first day of
school, didn't she...?

387
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:45,750
And don't forget.

388
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:49,083
Now you're going home
with me, Mr. Popular!

389
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:52,000
See?

390
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:55,333
It's true, I have
noticed that lately.

391
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:57,250
My time's finally come!

392
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:58,625
Speaking of which.

393
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:00,416
What exactly were you
talking about...?

394
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,291
I mean this morning
with Ayase...

395
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:03,625
I would like to know.

396
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,541
It's probably not
my place to ask

397
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:07,625
but still I'm
sort of curious.

398
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:09,000
Because...

399
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:10,041
When you were
talking to her

400
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:11,500
you looked deep
in thought...

401
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,625
Like something was
really bothering you...

402
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:15,625
I was a little worried.

403
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:17,041
We were just chatting...

404
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:18,583
About the di-swords
and stuff...

405
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:20,541
She's got one, I
hoped she might help.

406
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:21,875
Oh yeah?

407
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:24,958
It's the real thing.

408
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:29,125
Well, that's
highly illegal!

409
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,208
But she...

410
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:32,208
I'm telling you,
that one's only a toy

411
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:33,708
that just looks real...

412
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:35,833
A toy, a toy,
a toy, a toy!

413
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:39,958
I'm not sure...

414
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:41,916
But it's possible
I have the ability

415
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,250
to turn my thoughts
into reality...

416
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:46,916
And I think that's why
the General is after me.

417
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,625
Are you talking about that
thing you looked up online...?

418
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:52,166
Taku, do you have
one of those?

419
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,916
That's not what I mean...

420
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,791
I think I might be
able to affect reality

421
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:58,166
without the help
of a machine.

422
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:01,416
You're teasing me,
you big weirdo!

423
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,666
Ha...! I get it, you're
just mimicking an anime

424
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,208
you've been
watching, aren't you?

425
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:06,958
It happened to me
when I was young...

426
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:10,333
An accident when I was
in elementary school.

427
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:11,583
Don't overthink it...

428
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:14,166
It's just another one
of your silly delusions.

429
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,041
Try not to dwell on
it anymore, okay?

430
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:27,166
No one's there...

431
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,583
You're fine.

432
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,333
Hey... Momo, my girl!

433
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:39,375
Banny Boy!

434
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:40,625
What brings you here?

435
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:43,166
You got any good stuff
on the New Gen incident?

436
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,000
Ah, you brought
food, I see...

437
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:47,041
You know me too well.

438
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:49,041
There's been another
New Gen crime, right?

439
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:50,416
So what's the plan...?

440
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,083
Are your people busy
pursuing the GE rate angle?

441
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:54,875
Yeah, that's right,
the GE rates...

442
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:56,458
Pretty amazing stuff...

443
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:58,541
I owe you big time for
turning me onto this lead.

444
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:00,000
That's it?

445
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:01,291
That's it...

446
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:03,166
No... Actually, I'm
investigating this thing

447
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,208
all on my own.

448
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:05,833
Have you lost
your mind...?

449
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:09,708
Banny Boy... going at this alone
can be extremely dangerous!

450
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:12,125
Or did you forget what
happened to Professor Ota

451
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:14,958
after he gave that televised
lecture on GE rates?

452
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:17,208
-Is that what you're after?
-Yeah.

453
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:19,041
He was the victim in
the staking, wasn't he?

454
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:21,250
I'll be fine,
don't worry about me...

455
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:22,541
I tried to
persuade the bosses

456
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:24,333
to jump on board
with this GE angle

457
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:26,875
but they think that
I'm a crazy person.

458
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:28,416
So... Is it really possible

459
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,291
to use biorhythms as weapons
of mass destruction...?

460
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:32,708
The truth is I can't
wrap my head around it...

461
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:34,291
If you think about it,

462
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:37,291
the whole thing does sound a
little bit nutty, doesn't it?

463
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:39,291
Look, it's exactly
like I told you before.

464
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:41,000
You're police,
you know what it's like

465
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:42,041
when there's a full moon...

466
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:44,166
The biorhythm
curves all spike...

467
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,666
Well what if something
caused biorhythms

468
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,166
to jump even higher?

469
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,166
The people would get all
excitable, wouldn't they?

470
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:50,958
And that's not all.

471
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:53,208
Shibuya is a very
special place...

472
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:54,291
The math is simple.

473
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:55,375
The higher the GE rate,

474
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:57,250
the higher the biorhythm
curve will be...

475
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:59,083
The rate is sixty-eight
hundred times

476
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:00,708
greater than the rate
of a full moon...

477
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:03,833
That's not exactly an
insignificant jump.

478
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:05,583
What's causing
it to happen now?

479
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:08,208
Here's what Professor Ota
said before he was killed...

480
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:09,625
That about six months ago

481
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:11,833
there was an unexpected
increase in the GE Rates,

482
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:13,458
which is usually impossible,

483
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:15,333
unless there is a sudden
geological change

484
00:21:15,416 --> 00:21:16,875
in the surrounding area.

485
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:19,333
-Change?
-Right...

486
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:20,791
At the crossing in
front of the station,

487
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:23,666
you'd need energy on the
level of a volcanic eruption

488
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:24,625
in order to match it.

489
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:26,250
A volcano...?

490
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:28,041
There's a force like that,
in the middle of the city?

491
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:29,041
That's insane!

492
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:30,416
That's exactly the point,

493
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,291
our GE rates are off
the charts right now.

494
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,916
And when the professor tried
to tell the public about this,

495
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,833
the New Gen killer
murdered him?

496
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:39,125
The day before he
was murdered...

497
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:40,833
the program he was
scheduled to appear

498
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:41,958
on went off the air...

499
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:43,458
No explanation...

500
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:44,666
Never showed.

501
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:45,750
Are you sure?

502
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:47,041
I got the info
from a friend

503
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:48,541
who works for the station.

504
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:50,333
Hard to imagine a
television network

505
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:52,125
being pressured that way...

506
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:53,666
Who's got pull like that?

507
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,375
I don't know
any specifics.

508
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:57,291
But government, religion,
and business...

509
00:21:57,375 --> 00:21:58,625
Those are definitely people

510
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:00,583
who aren't afraid to get
their noses dirty...

511
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:01,625
Banny Boy...

512
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:03,875
You could lose
your job, you know?

513
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:05,625
If I can catch
the New Gen perp

514
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:06,958
and put a stop to all this,

515
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:08,500
then that's fine by me.

516
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:11,041
Come look at this.

517
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,416
"Meiwa Party"?

518
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,458
Momo...

519
00:22:17,541 --> 00:22:18,958
Give me a break here.

520
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:20,583
If I was making an
educated guess

521
00:22:20,666 --> 00:22:22,916
I probably woulda said
opposition party...

522
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,625
This is the last thing
I would've thought.

523
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:28,166
If this blows up, it'll
shake the whole country.

524
00:22:29,458 --> 00:22:30,708
No...

525
00:22:30,791 --> 00:22:31,958
This can't be true.

526
00:22:32,041 --> 00:22:34,041
Hey, Takki, what's wrong?

527
00:22:34,125 --> 00:22:36,041
-Look at this.
-Huh?

528
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:38,500
Whoa, they're going
crazy over it!

529
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:39,875
"Phantasm...

530
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:42,125
FES's real name is Ayase...

531
00:22:42,208 --> 00:22:43,791
She was previously
hospitalized

532
00:22:43,875 --> 00:22:45,416
due to psychiatric problems."

533
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,708
"AHM...

534
00:22:46,791 --> 00:22:48,416
Arkheart Medical Group...

535
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,000
It's a longstanding
specialized medical facility

536
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:53,625
which only treats
serious mental cases."

537
00:22:53,708 --> 00:22:55,375
Ayase's been there, too?

538
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:57,666
Hurry up...
You must find it...

539
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:59,875
If you can find your
sword you will be saved.

540
00:22:59,958 --> 00:23:02,666
I wonder if I can really
believe the things she says.

541
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:05,583
Damn... Stupid
phone scared me.

542
00:23:05,666 --> 00:23:07,375
That's exactly why
I didn't want one.

543
00:23:07,458 --> 00:23:08,708
Well, pick it up.

544
00:23:08,791 --> 00:23:10,625
It's probably
just Nanami...

545
00:23:10,708 --> 00:23:12,000
Hello. What?

546
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,375
Who is this?

547
00:23:21,083 --> 00:23:23,000
The General...?

548
00:23:23,083 --> 00:23:24,666
Seira baby,
what should I do?

549
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:25,750
Should I answer?

550
00:23:25,833 --> 00:23:27,000
You can ignore him,
you know...

551
00:23:27,083 --> 00:23:28,208
Just hang up.

552
00:23:28,291 --> 00:23:29,291
Oh, yeah...

553
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:31,166
I could definitely
just hang up, huh?

554
00:23:35,583 --> 00:23:36,916
What's that?

555
00:23:39,666 --> 00:23:40,958
Takki.

556
00:24:01,333 --> 00:24:02,416
Taku.

557
00:24:17,708 --> 00:24:19,916
Hello?

558
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,583
Yes, and who is
this exactly...?

559
00:24:22,666 --> 00:24:24,083
Oh... I'm fine...

560
00:24:24,166 --> 00:24:26,416
No, everything's
okay, it's just...

561
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,125
I'm sorry, say that again?

562
00:24:28,208 --> 00:24:29,625
But that can't
be possible...!

563
00:24:29,708 --> 00:24:31,000
Because...

564
00:24:31,083 --> 00:24:33,625
Because actually
I'm the one who...

565
00:24:33,708 --> 00:24:35,500
Get away from the windows!

566
00:24:35,583 --> 00:24:36,916
Yes...

567
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,916
Yes...

568
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,583
She's my sister...

569
00:24:40,666 --> 00:24:42,458
Oh, okay...

570
00:24:42,541 --> 00:24:44,375
Okay, thank you very much.

571
00:25:07,375 --> 00:25:13,083
[Music]

572
00:26:43,666 --> 00:26:45,333
Those eyes...

573
00:26:45,416 --> 00:26:46,708
Whose are they?
