2
00:01:38,083 --> 00:01:40,041
I'm Takumi Nishijo...

3
00:01:40,125 --> 00:01:42,083
The day that a strange
earthquake struck,

4
00:01:42,166 --> 00:01:45,166
Ayase jumped off the
roof of the school.

5
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:47,833
Apparently, I created a
delusion of a flowerbed

6
00:01:47,916 --> 00:01:50,375
that saved her life
by breaking her fall.

7
00:01:50,458 --> 00:01:53,666
After that, rumors started
flying about me and Ayase...

8
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:56,833
I quickly became the target
of all the jerks in my class.

9
00:01:56,916 --> 00:02:00,000
Then suddenly a mysterious voice
began to echo in my head...

10
00:02:00,083 --> 00:02:02,500
The voice belonged
to Kozue Orihara,

11
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:03,875
aka "Kozzy"...

12
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:07,041
Turns out she's a
friend of Sena's.

13
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:10,375
Sena explained that she and
Kozzy are gigalomaniacs,

14
00:02:10,458 --> 00:02:12,416
or special people
with a unique ability

15
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,875
to turn delusions
into reality

16
00:02:14,958 --> 00:02:17,041
through a process
called real-booting...

17
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:18,791
She also told me that
there are bad people

18
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:21,666
who want to recreate this
power artificially

19
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,541
and use it for evil.

20
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:25,208
Takumi...

21
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:26,791
Thank you.

22
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,833
Huh?

23
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:02,500
What?

24
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:03,875
What the hell is this?

25
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:05,583
Some kind of trick?

26
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:12,958
Who exactly is this girl?

27
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:14,791
Have I seen her before?

28
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:19,625
It doesn't look like the
tape has been edited...

29
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:21,166
It looks real.

30
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:24,458
Better be careful...

31
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:25,750
I think I just
saw something

32
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:27,583
I wasn't supposed to see.

33
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:38,708
I didn't get to
see Rimi today...

34
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:41,500
It seems like she's been absent
ever since the earthquake...

35
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:42,958
Hope everything's okay.

36
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:46,416
Kozzy.

37
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,541
Taku...

38
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:49,416
Sena is calling for you.

39
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,833
She is...?

40
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:52,500
Oh no-

41
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:54,125
Our only option is
to destroy the

42
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:57,250
Nozomi Corporation
once and for all.

43
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:59,166
Are we really going
to attack them?

44
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,875
Don't worry, the three of
us will combine our power

45
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:03,875
and give those bad
guys a smackdown!

46
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:06,916
I think I'll pass...

47
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,875
After all, I don't
even have a di-sword.

48
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:13,333
Hey... Crying won't make
me change my mind--

49
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:15,916
Look... Takumi's making
the new girl cry.

50
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,875
Well, well. First
FES, now her.

51
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:19,375
Look at you, Mr. Popular!

52
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:20,500
Nice work.

53
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,500
I'm not coming
with you, okay?

54
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:29,166
It's about time.

55
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,958
-Sena.
-Don't get the wrong idea.

56
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:35,541
The only reason you're
coming is 'cause

57
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:37,791
Kozue insisted all three
of us go together.

58
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:39,916
I'd be just fine
without you.

59
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,500
Well that was
nice of her...

60
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:42,541
But I'm not going.

61
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:44,166
Taku, please!

62
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,125
Well I don't intend to force
you to come along with us.

63
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:48,375
But I will give
you one warning:...

64
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:50,333
Nozomi Technology is
trying to collect samples

65
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:52,083
from gigalomaniacs...

66
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,666
and they don't care what
destruction they cause

67
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,416
in the process, so you
should be careful.

68
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,333
The fact that you're a
gigalomaniac means that

69
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:00,833
at some point they will be
coming after you too.

70
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:02,541
But of course, there's
a possibility

71
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:04,791
that they're targeting
you already.

72
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:07,375
You think they're
coming for me?

73
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:09,833
If you want to know the
truth, then come with us.

74
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:11,291
Sena, wait!

75
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:15,250
Oh no...

76
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:16,541
What if the General
has something to do

77
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:19,000
with the Nozomi Corporation?

78
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:20,333
Taku?

79
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:21,958
Sena is right...

80
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:23,708
If there's something
that you need to know,

81
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:26,916
you should come with us and
see it with your own eyes.

82
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,125
With my own eyes, huh?

83
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:31,583
Yes... With your
very own eyes...

84
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:33,958
It's time to be brave.

85
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:35,916
Be brave?

86
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:55,875
The Gigalomaniac Trio's
off to take out

87
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:58,041
the bad guys once
and for all!

88
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:03,750
What sort of a
graph is this?

89
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:07,083
It shows patterns of GE rates in
Shibuya over the last year...

90
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:08,333
Now maybe it's
my imagination,

91
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:09,583
but I get the feeling

92
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:12,458
they're being controlled
by some outside force.

93
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:14,500
Do you really think something
like that could happen?

94
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:17,083
Well... It all seems
pretty unnatural to me...

95
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:18,500
There's too many
fluctuations

96
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:20,375
and according to
my research...

97
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:22,291
GE rates are only spiking
on the weekends,

98
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:24,208
which seems like an
extremely unusual pattern

99
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:25,416
if you ask me.

100
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,708
For example...

101
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:28,625
Do you see
these two areas?

102
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:31,208
The GE measurements
are enormous.

103
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:32,916
Compared to the rest of the
graph, the one on the right

104
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,500
looks like the biggest
jump of the year.

105
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:36,000
Never mind the year.

106
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:37,916
That one's the largest spike
in the last few decades.

107
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,208
What are the dates?

108
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:40,916
The one in the middle
was three months ago.

109
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,166
Do you remember
that earthquake?

110
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,500
It wasn't huge but it
did cause some damage.

111
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:46,375
That's right, it was only
three on the scale,

112
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:48,666
but somehow eight
people still died.

113
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:49,916
The big one happened
on the same day

114
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,083
as the most recent quake.

115
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:52,250
Uh-huh.

116
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:53,916
Did you know that
a large outbreak

117
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,458
of electromagnetic pulses
occurred on that day?

118
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:59,625
Yeah, apparently computers
all over Shibuya broke down.

119
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:01,666
They say that the
electromagnetic waves

120
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,375
were a result of
the earthquake,

121
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:05,375
but what if the
opposite were true...?

122
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:06,458
What if the earthquake

123
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:08,541
was a direct result
of the waves?

124
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:10,041
This is just conjecture...

125
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:12,166
But I believe that both
of these earthquakes

126
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,875
might possibly have
been man-made...

127
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:17,333
Think about it, neither
of them were normal.

128
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:19,541
The first one killed
eight people even though

129
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:21,083
it was only a three
on the scale.

130
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:22,291
This one was a five,

131
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,625
and it killed just
over one hundred.

132
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:26,916
You're saying that too
many people are dying?

133
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,708
And don't forget,
there were rumors

134
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:30,291
that the sky turned white.

135
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:32,041
Now that you mention
it, it does seem like

136
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:33,583
everybody stopped
reporting that story

137
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:35,000
all of a sudden.

138
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:36,375
It's possible somebody
was putting pressure

139
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:38,375
on the media outlets.

140
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,166
You're kidding, right?

141
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,666
The Meiwa Party.

142
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,333
Yeah, that would
be my first guess.

143
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:44,875
Whoa... Are you serious?

144
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:46,791
Then we should probably
look into businesses

145
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:49,583
with strong political
ties to the party?

146
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:50,958
I'm way ahead
of you, Banny.

147
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:54,375
Momo, my girl,
you're the best... So-

148
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:55,750
I couldn't
find a thing.

149
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:57,458
Oh come on now...

150
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:59,000
There's no leads at all?

151
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:00,583
I'm sorry, Miss Momo,
but are you sure

152
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:02,083
you're not wrong
about all this?

153
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:03,625
Well either someone's
done a good job

154
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:04,708
covering their tracks...

155
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:07,000
or I'm wrong this time.

156
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:09,875
I guess we'll have to attack
this from another angle.

157
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:11,166
Yeah but where
do we start, sir?

158
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,958
Do you have anything
specific in mind?

159
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:16,166
Somebody's gotta be
benefitting from GE rates

160
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,791
spiking on the weekends...

161
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:19,625
That specific
enough for you?

162
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:27,458
Our only objective is
to destroy Noah II.

163
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:30,250
But, how can we destroy it
if we don't know where it is?

164
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:32,583
I put the screws to some
people and found out...

165
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:35,291
Noah II's in an underground
research facility.

166
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:38,250
You put the
screws to them?

167
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:40,875
Hey... We can't just walk
through the front door!

168
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,083
Don't worry, Taku,
everything's peachy keen,

169
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:44,583
just follow us!

170
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:46,541
"Peachy keen"...?
Yeah I bet.

171
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,583
Oh no.

172
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:01,916
Hello, sirs.

173
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:06,750
They're just gonna let
us walk in like that?

174
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:08,583
Don't worry, they
can't see us.

175
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:10,208
What do you mean?

176
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:13,583
To them, we look like some
company executives in suits.

177
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:15,750
To protect our identity,
I created particles

178
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:17,250
with my di-sword...

179
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:19,666
then sent them to the dead
spots of everyone inside.

180
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,916
Is it really
that easy to do?

181
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,208
Sure is.

182
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:26,166
Being a gigalomaniac
is pretty cool, huh?

183
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,125
Just remember, don't
let your guard down.

184
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:50,875
Please... Let's stop...

185
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:52,416
I hate to say this...

186
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,041
I don't want to...

187
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:57,041
But I'm afraid Takumi
Nishijo needs to be erased.

188
00:09:58,541 --> 00:09:59,875
And why is that?

189
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:02,375
'Cause he's way
too dangerous...

190
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:03,708
So just tell me...

191
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:05,166
Do you want it done?

192
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,125
No... Not yet...

193
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:10,291
There are many things I
need him to do for me.

194
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:12,875
Tell me...

195
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:13,791
I've always
wanted to know,

196
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:15,916
do you remember
your dreams?

197
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,791
-Yes.
-Really...?

198
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:20,416
I forget mine,
I can't ever remember them.

199
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,958
There are some
people who can,

200
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:23,625
and others who cannot.

201
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:25,666
The ones who remember...

202
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,791
They must be romantics.

203
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:29,541
Sometimes I have dreams
that seem like

204
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:31,041
they'll never end.

205
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:32,916
I used to be like that...

206
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,833
Or at least I
feel like I was...

207
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:37,625
But that's just an
illusion, right?

208
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:40,250
A dream in my heart.

209
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:42,583
Please, you need to wake
up from your dream...

210
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:44,458
If you don't...

211
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:47,875
I'm afraid that someday you'll
be erased by Takumi Nishijo!

212
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:50,250
That's all right with me...

213
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:52,916
Sooner or later this
dream will have to end.

214
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:57,458
Will there be anything
left in this world...?

215
00:10:57,541 --> 00:10:59,833
After the dream is over?

216
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:07,041
Looks like Noah II's
not in here either.

217
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:11,458
-This is odd.
-Huh?

218
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:14,083
Where's all the staff,
why aren't they down here?

219
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:16,333
Well, I don't know, maybe
they all went home early.

220
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:17,458
Stay on your toes.

221
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:23,708
Look... there.

222
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:34,291
Noah II.

223
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:35,875
Well, well,

224
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:38,500
I trust you found what
you were looking for?

225
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:46,083
It's the President
of the Nozomi Group.

226
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:48,041
Genichi Norose!

227
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:50,250
Welcome, my young
gigalomaniac friends,

228
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:51,541
to the future!

229
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:54,541
Oh no...! He knows
that it's us!

230
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:56,125
Are we being ambushed?

231
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:06,958
Miss Kishimoto...

232
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:08,791
It's time to take
your temperature!

233
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:10,958
Miss Kishimoto?

234
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:13,000
You see, I've received
quite a few reports

235
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:14,791
that a young girl has
been going around

236
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:18,041
defeating my porters with
a single sword.

237
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:20,291
Immediately I knew
it had to be you...

238
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:22,458
Sena Hatano.

239
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,666
Hatano...? I
don't understand,

240
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,958
I thought that Sena's
last name was Aoi...

241
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:28,666
Those two seem to know
each other though.

242
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,958
Oh I'm so scared...

243
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:34,416
Barbaric activities such
as fighting with swords...

244
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,625
That's never really
been my specialty.

245
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:41,458
A di-sword...! Is he
a gigalomaniac, too?

246
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:54,250
I've never seen a combat
game like this one.

247
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:56,125
So, did you find
your father yet? !

248
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:57,333
You shut your mouth!

249
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:03,333
She's predicting
every move I make...

250
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:04,500
How? !

251
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,208
He's coming at
you from the side!

252
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,166
This time he's gonna
try to fake you out

253
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,958
and then strike when
you leap towards him.

254
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:24,000
Stand up.

255
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:25,458
So the little one's
reading my mind

256
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:27,750
and communicating
it to you.

257
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:29,208
After all this is done,

258
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:31,875
I'm going to make you
Noah II's next sample.

259
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:32,958
Please don't make
me kill you,

260
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:34,916
you might actually
prove useful here.

261
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:42,125
What the hell is that?

262
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:44,250
He real-booted mirrors
to confuse her...

263
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:45,958
Kozue!

264
00:13:55,625 --> 00:14:07,583
Who are you?

265
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:09,166
Are you a person?

266
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:15,958
Who are you...?

267
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:19,333
Kozzy, what's wrong?

268
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:20,666
As a little girl,
she was harassed

269
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,708
by a group of stalkers.

270
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:24,375
A group of stalkers?

271
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:27,000
Every day, masses of
strangers would scream at her,

272
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:28,416
"Who are you?" ,

273
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,000
showing her mirrors, forcing
her to look at herself...

274
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:33,041
Eventually, she
became so terrified

275
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:35,208
that she lost her identity.

276
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:38,166
And because of her fear,
she lost the ability to speak.

277
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,625
Don't you say
another word!

278
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:43,250
Don't go yet, I haven't
given you my present!

279
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:47,958
No, go away.

280
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:50,041
Please just stay
away from me!

281
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:53,750
I don't understand,
Sena's afraid of dogs?

282
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:55,416
You know something,
Miss Hatano?

283
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,875
You haven't
changed one bit.

284
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:58,500
Stop it! No, please don't...

285
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:01,250
Just leave me alone!

286
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:11,750
Sena.

287
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:15,833
There is nothing for
you to be afraid of...

288
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:18,541
You will always
be Kozue...

289
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:20,750
No matter what people
say, you're still you.

290
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:28,583
Well... Visually projecting
your image onto your blazer,

291
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:30,583
that's quite a trick
you just pulled.

292
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:32,708
You've finally learned
how to use your power.

293
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:34,000
Yes.

294
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:38,791
I had to so that I
could destroy you.

295
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:40,166
Those chains.

296
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,541
You've given me some
fun toys to play with.

297
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,541
What?

298
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:54,916
Sena!

299
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:03,875
You leave Sena alone!

300
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:16,708
Sena.

301
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:18,000
How can she keep
on fighting

302
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:19,750
when she's in that condition?

303
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:21,041
Why?

304
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,791
Sensory control.

305
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:28,500
Visual projection...

306
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:29,875
Mind reading...

307
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:31,500
We've collected more
than enough data

308
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:33,041
from this subject.

309
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:36,750
Mr. atano...

310
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:38,708
As a researcher and
someone who gave his wife

311
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:40,958
to our experiment in
accordance with the creeds

312
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,708
of the Church of
the Divine Light,

313
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:45,875
you must be quite satisfied
with our results.

314
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:48,041
Dad, what's wrong with
Mom? Is she okay...?

315
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:49,833
I don't understand what's
happening here...?

316
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:53,875
What is that? What
is she holding?

317
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:56,333
Don't worry, Mommy's
perfectly fine.

318
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:57,416
She's only dreaming.

319
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,916
Dreaming?

320
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,791
In her mind, your mother's
living a normal everyday life...

321
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:05,250
But the moment of her awakening
has finally come now.

322
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:06,583
Please don't do this...

323
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:08,625
Please sir, just let
her stay like this.

324
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:10,416
What could it hurt...?
I'm begging you.

325
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,875
Please don't!

326
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,916
Oh no, my little baby...

327
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,791
What happened to
my little baby? !

328
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,166
No way...

329
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,625
That can't be my
little sister...!

330
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:27,875
What the hell did
you do to her? !

331
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:32,500
Sena Hatano is a
valuable sample...

332
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:34,166
Everyone give her the
red-carpet treatment.

333
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:39,291
Sweetie, I'm so sorry...

334
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:40,958
Please forgive me.

335
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:46,833
Damn you...! Damn you both!

336
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:52,750
What just happened...?

337
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:55,625
That wasn't a normal delusion.

338
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:57,250
Wait, what is this...?

339
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,916
Huh? Sena, are you okay? !

340
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,666
I was the one who ordered
your whole family

341
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,250
to meet a tragic end...

342
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:07,166
But they were part of
something very significant.

343
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,541
It was an invaluable
scientific experiment.

344
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:11,333
I'll kill you!

345
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:14,791
All your code samples have
already been extracted...

346
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:16,666
To be completely honest...

347
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,708
you're of absolutely
no use to me!

348
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:32,833
What is it this time?

349
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:35,875
Ah, this must be
your handiwork.

350
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:42,333
All right, backup is here!

351
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:43,916
Cocytus flows.

352
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,166
If I remember all
this correctly,

353
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,583
Cocytus is a river on the
lowest level of hell

354
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:50,625
in Greek Mythology...

355
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:52,916
And all the sinners there-

356
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:55,791
-will freeze forever!

357
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:02,625
Sena... I don't get it,

358
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,833
how come we're not
ice blocks too?

359
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:06,416
She doesn't want us to
be, so her delusion didn't

360
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,833
involve us being frozen.

361
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:15,500
You saved us...

362
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,416
Thank you.

363
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,916
But how in the world
did you find us?

364
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,916
I was led here by the
power of the Great Will...

365
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,833
My mission was to rescue
my fellow Black Knights.

366
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,583
We have to work together
to stop the resurrection

367
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:29,791
of the devil king...

368
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:31,083
To put an end to...

369
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:34,125
an end to... Glad-

370
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:36,125
Hey, what's
wrong, are you okay?

371
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:37,583
Her wounds haven't
healed yet.

372
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:38,875
She pushed it
way too hard.

373
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:40,791
This girl's got guts!

374
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:42,083
It's all because of you...

375
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:43,625
You saved us...

376
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:45,958
-Thank you.
-Norose!

377
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:47,291
You don't know when
to give up, do you?

378
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:50,625
This ends right now!

379
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:51,958
I'll crush you!

380
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:58,750
Wait. Hey, you
two cut it out.

381
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:00,041
What the heck
are you doing?

382
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:00,958
You're on the same side!

383
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:09,791
Even though they're going
after each other,

384
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,958
in their minds they think
they're fighting me.

385
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:15,333
Wait, what do you mean?

386
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:16,583
Because of your
delusion they believe

387
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:17,500
they're fighting you...

388
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:18,833
What did you do?

389
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:20,500
Did you send particles
into their dead spots

390
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:21,583
to confuse them?

391
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:23,125
That's absolutely right...

392
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:25,208
And I took it further...

393
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:26,916
To give it a little flavor
I made it so they can't

394
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,791
see anything besides me,
and the very sight of it

395
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:32,625
fills them with a burning
rage they can't control.

396
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:33,875
So what now...?

397
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:35,916
Your friends are
in grave danger.

398
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:38,791
I shouldn't
have come here.

399
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:40,333
I should've just stayed
home and watched anime

400
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:42,000
and played video games.

401
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:43,750
I hope your plan isn't
to stand there

402
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:45,833
and watch your friends
murder each other.

403
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:48,083
This is a delusion...
Wake up...!

404
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:50,333
Come on wake up from it
like you always do!

405
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:51,583
I hate to disappoint,

406
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:54,041
but that's not the way
this is going to go...

407
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:56,250
I didn't prepare a "this
is all just a bad dream"

408
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:58,416
ending for you.

409
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,583
It's impossible.

410
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:00,625
I don't have the sword
or the courage

411
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:01,916
to fight that monster.

412
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,041
I can't do it! I can't!

413
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:06,333
I guess it's probably
time to end this thing.

414
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:10,458
No please!

415
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:11,708
Help me. Sena!

416
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:13,916
Kozzy, please! I'm
begging you, save me!

417
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:24,916
Please don't do this...

418
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,750
My, my.

419
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:37,375
-Sena!
-Hear me now...

420
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:39,500
The blade of this di-sword
will take revenge on you

421
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:40,500
and that man...!

422
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:42,375
Now prepare to die!

423
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:44,250
This can't be...

424
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:46,041
How can she see me...?

425
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:47,750
He must have sent
antiparticles

426
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:49,000
into each of
their dead spots

427
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:50,875
to cancel out my particles...

428
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:53,375
thereby putting an
end to the delusion.

429
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:54,666
Here I come!

430
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,333
Bam, boom,...

431
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:57,750
crash!

432
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,083
Hey we did it! We
destroyed Noah II!

433
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:04,666
What the hell
did he just do?

434
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,458
Takumi Nishijo...

435
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:08,000
Even though you
don't know it,

436
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:11,541
the moment of your awakening
draws nearer every day.

437
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:13,625
I don't get it,
what just happened?

438
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:16,541
What happened is, the
Gigalomaniac Trio plus one...

439
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:18,625
just kicked some
serious butt!

440
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:19,666
Yeah, we did it!

441
00:22:21,958 --> 00:22:23,375
Where are you?

442
00:22:23,458 --> 00:22:26,416
Congratulations, you destroyed
the Noah II prototype...

443
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,666
You think I'd let you
near the real thing?

444
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,625
It was a prototype? !

445
00:22:30,708 --> 00:22:32,625
And the person you fought
so hard to defeat

446
00:22:32,708 --> 00:22:34,458
was nothing more
than a copy of me

447
00:22:34,541 --> 00:22:36,125
made by the prototype.

448
00:22:36,208 --> 00:22:37,500
No way.

449
00:22:37,583 --> 00:22:39,250
Of course, the
machine's defective.

450
00:22:39,333 --> 00:22:40,708
The real me is
much stronger

451
00:22:40,791 --> 00:22:42,583
than the fake
version it produced.

452
00:22:42,666 --> 00:22:44,125
-Trust me.
-Hold on...

453
00:22:44,208 --> 00:22:45,375
What do you mean, are
you saying that you're

454
00:22:45,458 --> 00:22:46,666
stronger than that? !

455
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:49,458
Don't worry, you'll
find out soon enough.

456
00:22:49,541 --> 00:22:51,750
Take care of
yourselves, my friends.

457
00:22:53,416 --> 00:22:54,583
I can't believe this!

458
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:55,875
That bastard was just
playing games with us

459
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:57,125
the whole time!

460
00:22:57,208 --> 00:22:58,333
Sena.

461
00:22:58,416 --> 00:23:00,125
Hey she doesn't
look so good...

462
00:23:00,208 --> 00:23:02,208
We'd better get her to
a hospital immediately.

463
00:23:02,291 --> 00:23:03,666
You're right, let's go.

464
00:23:09,333 --> 00:23:10,541
Rimi...

465
00:23:10,625 --> 00:23:12,291
She's absent again.

466
00:23:12,375 --> 00:23:14,000
Taku... Morning!

467
00:23:16,916 --> 00:23:18,000
Hi!

468
00:23:20,458 --> 00:23:21,958
Thank goodness...

469
00:23:22,041 --> 00:23:23,791
I'm so glad she came!

470
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,958
Whoa, Taku...

471
00:23:26,041 --> 00:23:27,166
What's wrong with you...?!

472
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:28,291
Did something happen?

473
00:23:28,375 --> 00:23:29,750
Are you crying?

474
00:23:31,083 --> 00:23:32,125
I know, you're crying
because you're so happy

475
00:23:32,208 --> 00:23:33,791
you got to see me again!

476
00:23:33,875 --> 00:23:35,916
I know you too well.

477
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,416
Oh I'm just kidding.

478
00:23:40,708 --> 00:23:42,000
Hiya, Taku.

479
00:23:42,083 --> 00:23:43,208
Whoa, gloomy.

480
00:23:43,291 --> 00:23:44,333
Somebody's depressed, huh?

481
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,166
Oh, don't worry, buddy,

482
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:48,625
I know that's just
the way you are...

483
00:23:48,708 --> 00:23:50,333
You can't help yourself.

484
00:23:50,416 --> 00:23:51,625
What's up?

485
00:23:51,708 --> 00:23:53,500
You're awfully cheery for
so early in the morning.

486
00:23:53,583 --> 00:23:54,750
What's so awful about it?

487
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:55,916
Well...

488
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,666
How about
"unbelievably" then?

489
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:58,791
Taku, I don't get it.

490
00:23:58,875 --> 00:24:00,208
How come she's
such a weirdo?

491
00:24:00,291 --> 00:24:02,416
Well I don't know.

492
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,750
I guess it's
like they say...

493
00:24:03,833 --> 00:24:05,583
The more things change...

494
00:24:05,666 --> 00:24:06,875
What's that
supposed to mean?

495
00:24:11,166 --> 00:24:12,375
It has been a
remarkable journey,

496
00:24:12,458 --> 00:24:13,750
so much time has passed

497
00:24:13,833 --> 00:24:16,000
since this project
was first conceived.

498
00:24:22,333 --> 00:24:24,541
Now, then.

499
00:24:24,625 --> 00:24:27,083
I'll admit, never in
my wildest dreams

500
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:29,708
did I imagine that you
were a gigalomaniac.

501
00:24:31,458 --> 00:24:32,833
In order for this to work,

502
00:24:32,916 --> 00:24:35,458
I need more samples from
you gigalomaniacs...

503
00:24:35,541 --> 00:24:36,916
Or to be a bit
more specific,

504
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,625
I am going to need a code
sample of your NA synapses...

505
00:24:40,708 --> 00:24:42,500
They're the part of your
brain that gives orders

506
00:24:42,583 --> 00:24:45,916
to the rest of your body
and tells it what to do.

507
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,666
Those samples are the equivalent
of a processor to Noah II.

508
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:51,750
Without it, the machine's
virtually worthless.

509
00:24:51,833 --> 00:24:53,541
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

510
00:24:55,458 --> 00:24:57,500
That's excellent.

511
00:24:57,583 --> 00:25:00,791
The day the world will be
reborn is drawing near.

512

513
00:26:43,458 --> 00:26:45,708
Those eyes, whose are they?
