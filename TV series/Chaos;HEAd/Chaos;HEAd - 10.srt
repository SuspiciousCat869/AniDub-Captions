2
00:01:37,833 --> 00:01:39,500
I'm Takumi Nishijo...

3
00:01:39,583 --> 00:01:41,875
I recently discovered that
the mysterious formula

4
00:01:41,958 --> 00:01:43,583
I doodled on the
back of an essay

5
00:01:43,666 --> 00:01:45,166
I wrote in elementary school

6
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:47,583
is the exact same one
the General sent to me

7
00:01:47,666 --> 00:01:49,541
while we were
chatting online.

8
00:01:49,625 --> 00:01:51,791
Then on the way home from
visiting Ayase in the hospital,

9
00:01:51,875 --> 00:01:53,541
Sena attacked me...

10
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:55,541
Apparently the
Nozomi Corporation

11
00:01:55,625 --> 00:01:56,583
developed the technology

12
00:01:56,666 --> 00:01:58,000
which led to Noah II

13
00:01:58,083 --> 00:02:00,208
based on the formula
in my doodle...

14
00:02:00,291 --> 00:02:02,625
Sena took out her rage
and frustration on me

15
00:02:02,708 --> 00:02:05,583
because she lost her mother
and sister in those experiments.

16
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:06,708
And again...

17
00:02:06,791 --> 00:02:08,333
I was saved by Rimi.

18
00:02:08,416 --> 00:02:11,583
It turns out she's
a gigalomaniac, too.

19
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:13,458
I was worried about Nanami,

20
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:16,625
so I tried to go to my parents'
place to check on her.

21
00:02:16,708 --> 00:02:18,041
But...

22
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:20,041
my home was nowhere
to be found.

23
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:31,000
Taku... Listen...

24
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:32,833
Your house has
never been here...

25
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:34,666
You just assumed it was...

26
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,666
Don't you see...?

27
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:36,875
Your memories are
nothing more

28
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:38,750
than your mind
tricking you.

29
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:39,958
But I... I...

30
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:41,875
Look I remember
growing up here...

31
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:43,750
I... I remember everything...

32
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:45,250
I don't understand this.

33
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:48,208
Taku... Your memories
are fabricated.

34
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:50,583
I'm sorry to tell you this,
but you're not real.

35
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:52,916
You shouldn't exist.

36
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,958
She's been lying
all along...

37
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:57,041
I thought I
could trust her.

38
00:02:57,125 --> 00:02:58,208
It was you...

39
00:02:58,291 --> 00:03:00,000
Yes... You were
behind the staking!

40
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:02,083
Taku... That was fake.

41
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:04,291
If our delusions
get too strong...

42
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:05,625
sometimes they'll mix...

43
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:06,958
They'll synchronize
with the delusions

44
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:09,291
of other gigalomaniacs.

45
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:10,666
At that time...

46
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,000
three synchronized
delusions

47
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:14,083
were happening
simultaneously...

48
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:15,875
Mine first...
Then yours...

49
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:16,958
Then the New Gen criminal.

50
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:18,791
You liar!

51
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:20,500
This isn't happening...

52
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:22,291
It's fake...
Another delusion...

53
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:23,791
Now I just have
to wake up!

54
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:26,375
You can't have any
more delusions.

55
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:27,958
If you keep this up...

56
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,833
Then I'll be forced
to erase you.

57
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:32,625
Erase...? Erase me...?

58
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:36,916
You really are the
New Gen criminal.

59
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,875
I'm not even real,
and you're gonna kill me...?

60
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:40,416
I don't understand...

61
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,041
What am I?

62
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:43,041
Taku...

63
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:44,833
You're only an
imagined person,

64
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:48,250
simply a gigalomaniac's
delusion.

65
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:51,416
You were born a little
over a year ago today.

66
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,875
No way... 'cause...

67
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:53,958
if that's true and
I'm that young,

68
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:56,083
then shouldn't
I be a toddler?

69
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:57,458
Since the time
you came to be,

70
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:59,166
you've always been you.

71
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,666
Then who created me,
whose delusion am I?

72
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:05,708
The real Takumi Nishijo.

73
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:13,416
I didn't want you to have
to deal with any of this...

74
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,833
I didn't want you to come
in the first place...

75
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:17,750
But now...
You've come this far...

76
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:20,625
Maybe it's better you know
the truth about who you are.

77
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:22,458
But wait,
if I'm a delusion...

78
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:25,166
then Nanami and my
parents are too!

79
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,333
This is seriously
messed up...

80
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:28,583
I was really hoping

81
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:30,916
that you were going to
be on my side, Rimi...

82
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,666
But I guess you've betrayed
me too, haven't you?

83
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,000
I know...

84
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:36,291
It's true...

85
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:38,333
I've been hiding lots
of things from you...

86
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:39,458
Sorry...

87
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:41,750
I'll understand if
you hate me forever.

88
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:43,250
I don't believe you...

89
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:45,208
I don't care if
you apologize...

90
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:46,333
I don't trust you.

91
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:50,083
Rimi's kindness...

92
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:53,083
Her warmth all but
saved my soul...

93
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:55,333
She taught me the
meaning of friendship...

94
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:56,666
But now...

95
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:59,625
That warmth feels like
it's an entire world away.

96
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:01,708
I have to leave soon.

97
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:03,541
Where do you have to go?

98
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:05,875
I'm going to hunt down
Nanami's kidnapper...

99
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:08,041
I have to bring an
end to all of this.

100
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:12,500
'Cause at this rate I won't
be able to protect you either.

101
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:16,208
What do you mean?
So Nanami has been kidnapped?

102
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:18,583
I'll be back, just wait
for me at your place...

103
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:19,875
Then we'll talk...

104
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:22,166
We'll gossip and have
all sorts of fun...

105
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,750
Taku... Will you
promise me one thing...?

106
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:27,250
Please don't have any
more delusions, okay...?

107
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:29,708
Your power is a lot stronger
than you think it is...

108
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:31,791
Each time you have
another delusion...

109
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:33,291
it shaves life
off the real you,

110
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:34,708
and shortens his time.

111
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:35,791
I don't get it...

112
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:37,541
No wait... Don't go.

113
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:38,625
See you later...

114
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:40,208
I gotta run...

115
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:41,083
Ten-hut!

116
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:43,958
Rimi.

117
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:54,416
How cute...
What is it called?

118
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,708
Well, her name is
Weepy the Frog.

119
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:57,583
Oh hello...

120
00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:59,166
Miss Weepy.

121
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:02,791
So... Momo...

122
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:04,458
Tell me where we stand...

123
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:06,250
Any leads on Shinko?

124
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:09,041
Well, it looks like your
hunch hit the mark, Banny Boy.

125
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:10,750
The parent company
of Shinko Limited

126
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:12,416
is Nozomi Technology.

127
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,666
I don't...

128
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,166
Nozomi what?

129
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,125
And why am I
not surprised?

130
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:19,250
Five years ago,
they merged by acquisition

131
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:21,708
into the Nozomi
Corporation...

132
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:23,666
Ever since, they've put
out a lot of products,

133
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,666
most of which have
been big hits.

134
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,458
It seems their change in
marketing strategy worked...

135
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:29,916
Basically what
they do is...

136
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,375
They crank out a new product
every weekend, am I right?

137
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:33,458
Yep.

138
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:35,666
How does this
relate to GE rates?

139
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,958
There's no way to deny
there's a connection...

140
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:40,000
All the evidence
points that way.

141
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:41,541
Since the merger
five years ago,

142
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:44,041
weekend GE Rates have
gone nowhere but up.

143
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:45,375
And that's not the only

144
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:47,916
interesting piece of
information about Shinko...

145
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,500
I went through all of
their documentation

146
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:50,916
from the very beginning...

147
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,583
and I think I hooked
us a big fish here.

148
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:54,208
Just how big?

149
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:56,083
Kozo Inohana.

150
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:00,750
He's the leader of
the Meiwa Party.

151
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:02,791
Things are starting
to connect...

152
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:04,041
The thing with
the Professor,

153
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:05,833
not to mention
the earthquake...

154
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:07,833
We've got the Meiwa Party
exerting pressure

155
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:09,416
on the media outlets...

156
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,250
And stopping all reporting
concerning GE rates.

157
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:13,916
Um... Excuse me...

158
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,625
But I'm starting
to get scared here.

159
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:21,458
A public phone?

160
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:23,916
Hello?

161
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,041
Who's this?

162
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:26,833
Sir, I'm so sorry...

163
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:28,541
I screwed up.

164
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:29,791
What happened?

165
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:35,083
Suwa... Tell me
what's going on!

166
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:38,208
I'm... at AH Tokyo
General Hospital.

167
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,500
What? The hospital?

168
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:41,791
What the hell
happened to you?

169
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:43,083
You there...? Suwa!

170
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:46,541
What's wrong?
Is everything okay?

171
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:47,541
Don't know...

172
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:48,875
But I'll tell
you this much,

173
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:50,708
somebody who doesn't like
what we've been up to

174
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:53,083
is making a move here.

175
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:54,666
Stay put and keep
your head down...

176
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,250
You got it?

177
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:57,333
Hey... Wait...!

178
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:58,500
Banny!

179
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,541
I wasn't created by
someone's delusion.

180
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:17,833
I know it...!

181
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:20,041
I'm real,
I'm Takumi Nishijo!

182
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:25,250
Hello?

183
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:27,458
Uh... Hey... Daisuke

184
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:30,541
Hey, Taku...! How are
things with you and Rimi...?

185
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:33,750
You owe me big time for leaving
you two alone by the way!

186
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:36,250
Daisuke knows me, that
means I must be real...

187
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:39,000
There's no need to worry,
I'm not a delusion.

188
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,666
You wanna hear
something funny?

189
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,666
The other day, my
girlfriend was asking me

190
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:46,208
how come you and I became such
good friends all of a sudden.

191
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:48,541
I sort of remember meeting
you through Rimi...

192
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:51,375
but for some reason I can't
remember any of the details,

193
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:52,833
it's all a little
bit hazy to me.

194
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:54,625
No...! Shut up,
don't say any more!

195
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:55,875
So what's up...?

196
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:57,541
When exactly did you
and I become friends?

197
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:00,583
I can't find anybody

198
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,916
who can prove to me
that I really do exist.

199
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:08,708
Well then...
I've got to get going.

200
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:17,625
I'm telling you,
I'll be fine...

201
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:19,333
you don't need to
worry about a thing...

202
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:20,583
I'll settle this.

203
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:22,916
I'm going to take care
of everything, Takumi...

204
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,125
Goodbye.

205
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:43,708
Detective!

206
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,500
I'm so glad you're here...

207
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:48,125
I just saw a suspicious
looking man go up on the roof.

208
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:52,583
Stay here.

209
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:06,041
The person that Detective Ban
is investigating,

210
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:08,250
I'm sure he's the one
who killed Mia...

211
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:09,958
I just have this feeling.

212
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:15,833
Mia?

213
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,958
Wait, am I seeing a ghost?

214
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,500
No, she's real.

215
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:32,625
Come on, Grim,
just say something.

216
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:33,875
Anything... Grim.

217
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:38,750
May the divine
light save you.

218
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:41,375
What's he saying?

219
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:42,458
Kill me...

220
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:45,333
I want you to kill me!

221
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:46,500
Somebody please...

222
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:47,875
just kill me...!

223
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:49,083
Rimi!

224
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:51,666
Taku...! Open the door...!

225
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,166
Let me in, Taku!

226
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,166
Wait a sec...

227
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,875
-That voice...
-Open up, dummy!

228
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:56,958
Nanami?

229
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:01,333
Wow, so you're alive.

230
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:03,000
She's acting
totally different

231
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:04,875
than the Nanami
on the phone...

232
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:06,708
Oh, I get it...

233
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,791
This Nanami must
be a delusion.

234
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:15,458
Hey, what's wrong, Taku...?

235
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:16,458
You seem upset.

236
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:17,791
Oh, shut up!

237
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:19,166
You know what...?

238
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,208
I don't appreciate you
talking to me like that!

239
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:22,916
What do you care?
You're not even real.

240
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,708
Not real...?

241
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:26,041
Taku... What's wrong?

242
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:27,833
You're not acting
like yourself at all.

243
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:31,375
I get it. You must
be hungry, huh...?

244
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,833
You want me to cook you
up something delicious?

245
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:35,958
Nanami, I need your help.

246
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:37,291
Just kill me...

247
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:39,583
Please, I want
you to kill me.

248
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:41,166
Huh?

249
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,125
Was I imagining things?

250
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:53,375
I know that laugh...

251
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:54,625
It's Mia!

252
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:02,458
Mia... It's you...

253
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:03,666
But how?

254
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,666
Do you really
think I'm Mia...?

255
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,791
Do you believe
that you're Yua?

256
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:09,666
What do you mean?

257
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,416
What if it's the
opposite, huh?

258
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,500
What if you're Mia and Yua
was the one who died...?

259
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:16,666
What if you were the
one who killed her?

260
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,666
No... What are you saying?

261
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,166
You hated your sister

262
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,083
because your parents
loved her more...

263
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:24,458
So you hired a killer
over the internet.

264
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:25,875
What's more...

265
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:28,000
to cover your tracks and
make it look like a suicide,

266
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:30,083
you made four
strangers jump.

267
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,916
So you became
the other sister.

268
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,583
And then you
pretended to grieve

269
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:36,208
and shed tears over your twin
sister's death, didn't you?

270
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:37,625
No... that can't be...!

271
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:39,708
-I am Yua!
-Yeah?

272
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:42,166
Can anyone prove that?

273
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:42,833
Me.

274
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:44,166
You saying it's true

275
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:46,375
doesn't mean anything to
anyone else, does it?

276
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:49,500
There's no way I'm Mia,
it's impossible!

277
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:51,916
Think about all those things
you've been investigating...

278
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,458
Multiple personalities...

279
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:54,583
sleepwalking...

280
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:55,750
memory forging...

281
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:57,791
and also delusions.

282
00:12:57,875 --> 00:12:59,416
I don't understand
anymore...

283
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,333
I don't know what I am!

284
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:03,666
Who I am!

285
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,375
Well, whoever you are,

286
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:07,958
you'll suffer the
same fate that I did.

287
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:20,708
In the beginning we were
joined together as one person...

288
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:22,750
We're simply returning.

289
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:24,875
With one step, I am you...

290
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:27,041
With one step,
you will become me.

291
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:29,041
Our fates are intertwined.

292
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:30,708
Because we are one person.

293
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:51,500
Sir, you came.

294
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:52,666
Suwa?

295
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:53,916
I'm glad you did.

296
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,750
What happened,
are you okay?

297
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:57,250
I'm just fine.

298
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:01,125
Suwa.

299
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:02,333
Well...

300
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:04,833
I should be congratulated
for my first shot.

301
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:06,000
Tell me why.

302
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:07,708
Because you got a
hold of information

303
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:08,958
you didn't need to know,

304
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:10,708
you were too clever
for your own good, sir.

305
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:12,250
I'm a detective.

306
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:14,291
Yes, but so am I.

307
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:16,708
But... you and
I were partners...

308
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:19,125
How could you go and
betray me like this?

309
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:20,500
Because honestly, sir,

310
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:22,541
you've always irritated
the hell out of me...

311
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:25,125
And now... it's
time for payback...

312
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:26,958
I have specific orders
to eliminate anything

313
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:28,750
that stands in my way.

314
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:30,000
Suwa...!

315
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:31,750
Please don't make
this mistake...!

316
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:33,291
Don't be a puppet
for these men,

317
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:35,250
you have to be in
control of your own mind!

318
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,166
May the divine
light save you, sir.

319
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:41,291
What are you doing...?

320
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:42,875
Don't you try to
run away from this.

321
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:44,666
You must feel
the pain I felt!

322
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,416
-But Mia...
-You're wrong...

323
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,625
Remember I'm Yua.

324
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:49,583
No, that's not true.

325
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:51,041
It is, you're Mia.

326
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:52,416
No, I don't understand.

327
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,500
Who are you?

328
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:55,375
I'm everything that
you wished for...

329
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:58,000
And you are everything
that I wished for.

330
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:03,166
Please...

331
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,541
For once in your life,
listen to what I have to say...

332
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:07,541
I have been patient with
you this whole time!

333
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:08,708
She'll kill me.

334
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,083
You see...?
The same face.

335
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:15,041
No one can tell who's
Mia and who's Yua,

336
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:16,166
'cause we're the same!

337
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:29,583
No way.

338
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:31,291
Hold on...
What's this...?

339
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:33,708
Tell me, what did
you just do to me?

340
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:35,833
Mia... I see...

341
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:37,208
It all makes sense now...

342
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:38,458
I finally understand,

343
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:39,916
I know why I put
so much effort

344
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,541
into investigating
your murder.

345
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:43,833
I was afraid of you...

346
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:45,625
And I always have been...

347
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:48,041
I thought you died
as a way to spite me.

348
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:49,875
I wanted to make
myself feel better

349
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:51,041
by proving once
and for all

350
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:52,458
that your death
wasn't my fault

351
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:54,166
and that I had
nothing to do with it.

352
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:57,958
No!

353
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:02,416
My sister...

354
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,625
has been dead
for two months...

355
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:06,416
So who are you?

356
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:13,833
What the...?

357
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:15,333
What's happening?

358
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:17,625
Don't tell me this brat's
a gigalomaniac...!

359
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:18,916
To hell with this!

360
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:25,875
Who's there?

361
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:29,958
Ayase...?

362
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:31,916
Wha...?

363
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,666
The power of the Great
Will kept me close by...

364
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:37,041
That's why I remained
here at the hospital...

365
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:38,458
It was leading me to you.

366
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:43,333
You see... You're one of the
seven Black Knights of Gladiale.

367
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:44,416
The Black Knights...?

368
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,583
What's that?

369
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:50,958
Come on... Just
hurry up and kill me.

370
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:54,375
Oh please, why don't
you give it a rest

371
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:55,875
with the lame jokes, Taku.

372
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:57,791
That's not like Nanami...

373
00:16:57,875 --> 00:16:59,333
The real Nanami
would get angry

374
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:01,666
and lecture me
for being stupid.

375
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,291
I meant to tell you...

376
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:06,041
I feel really bad 'cause I
lost the bracelet you gave me.

377
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:09,125
I'm so sorry...

378
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:11,625
It's the first present you
ever gave me, you remember...?

379
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:13,541
I really did love
that bracelet...

380
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:15,791
And I don't know
how I lost it...

381
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:17,791
Taku... You hear
what I said?

382
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:19,541
I just...

383
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:21,541
I just...

384
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:23,916
Why do you always act
like this, Taku...?

385
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,083
You know it
wouldn't kill you

386
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:26,791
to show me some
brotherly dependability

387
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:29,125
every once in a while.

388
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:34,125
I'm... I'm just a delusion,
I'm not even real!

389
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:36,125
Sometimes... I just
wish you would pamper me

390
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:38,875
and treat me with a
little more kindness.

391
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:41,916
Hey, I'm kinda
sad now, so...

392
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,291
I want you to hold me
for a little bit...

393
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:46,208
Will you please?

394
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:48,625
Just for once let me have
it my way, okay...?

395
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:49,916
Just give me a hug...

396
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,583
Come on... Please?

397
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,041
It's okay...

398
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:05,125
There's no need
to be afraid.

399
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:10,708
Noah II...

400
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:13,791
It's already working.

401
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:16,166
It's all thanks to you.

402
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,833
Hello there, Rimi...

403
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:19,541
It's been a while,
hasn't it?

404
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,458
Nanami!

405
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:32,125
Of course you
must know this...

406
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:34,000
But you being here
is a big problem.

407
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:35,750
You let Nana go!

408
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:38,250
She doesn't have anything
to do with this!

409
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:40,500
Nanami!

410
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:42,500
Rimi.

411
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:43,958
My right hand...

412
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:45,250
It hurts...

413
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:46,708
It hurts bad.

414
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:51,291
Nana!

415
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:53,333
Hey uh... Rimi...

416
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:56,416
You haven't seen my bracelet
anywhere have you...?

417
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,750
I can't find it...

418
00:18:57,833 --> 00:18:59,666
I've looked everywhere.

419
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,166
A bracelet?

420
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:05,000
Oh yeah... That's right...

421
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:05,916
Don't you worry...

422
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,791
I know exactly
where it is...

423
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:09,083
Let's just get
out of here

424
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:11,000
and we'll go get
it together.

425
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:14,166
My... My hand hurts bad...

426
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,208
Rimi...

427
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:17,083
How do you and I
know each other...?

428
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:18,500
I can't remember.

429
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:20,875
I feel like I should know
you but there's nothing...

430
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:23,041
-It's blank.
-Nanami.

431
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:25,916
Rimi tell me... did you
steal my bracelet?!

432
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,583
Why?! That's so mean.

433
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:30,375
What exactly are
you showing her?

434
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:33,916
Did you take it, Rimi?

435
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,291
Don't lie to me!

436
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:39,458
Of course I didn't.

437
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:41,208
Why did you take
it from me...?

438
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:42,416
Give it back...

439
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,458
Please just give
it back to me!

440
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:46,708
It's okay! Calm down...

441
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:48,458
It's precious to me,
you know...?

442
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:50,375
It was a present
from my brother...

443
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:52,458
I don't want anyone else
to have it but me...!

444
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:53,750
Give it to me...

445
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:55,083
Give it to me!

446
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:56,375
Give it back!

447
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,125
No way... A di-sword!

448
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:15,208
Please, give it back...

449
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:16,250
I want it...

450
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:17,291
If you don't...

451
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:18,416
I won't forgive you...

452
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,208
I swear!

453
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:21,541
Nana...

454
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:24,166
I can't believe you're
a gigalomaniac too!

455
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:30,333
You can cry... but I
still can't do anything...

456
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:32,750
Don't you get it,
I'm just a delusion...

457
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:34,375
I'm not real.

458
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:36,500
It's impossible, you're
real, I know it...!

459
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:38,791
I remember everything from
when we were little kids,

460
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:40,875
don't you, Taku?

461
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:42,916
You may not be
very dependable...

462
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,333
But regardless,
you're my brother

463
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:47,375
and we've been together
since the beginning!

464
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:48,416
That's it...

465
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,083
Nanami is right...

466
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:53,250
I remember when we were little
kids growing up together...

467
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:57,083
I have memories
of our childhood!

468
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:58,583
Nanami.

469
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:00,291
My sister...

470
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:02,583
She's the only hope I
have left in this world.

471
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:05,125
Nobody else can rescue
me from this nightmare.

472
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:06,458
Nanami...

473
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:07,666
Help me...

474
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:08,291
Please help me.

475
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:10,208
Taku.

476
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:12,375
If Nanami's warmth is real,

477
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:15,500
I can prove to myself
that I actually do exist!

478
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:16,416
Please hug me...

479
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,125
Will you?

480
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,833
If this is the only way
I'll be able to save Nanami...

481
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:23,458
If this is the only
way to save myself!

482
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:24,583
Nanami...

483
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:25,666
Save me.

484
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,208
Oh, Taku!

485
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:41,083
You did cruel things to Nana
just like you did to me!

486
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:43,833
Don't worry she wasn't
near as much effort as you.

487
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:46,625
You see it's not
like before,

488
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:50,291
now we have set procedures
for awakening our specimen...

489
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:51,833
Of course it goes
without saying,

490
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:54,958
none of those protocols will
work on Takumi Nishijo...

491
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:56,291
There's nothing
more difficult

492
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:59,125
than dealing with an irregular
monster, is there?

493
00:21:59,208 --> 00:22:01,500
He's not a monster,
don't call him that!

494
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:03,916
Yes of course I'm sorry...

495
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,125
How... about a freak
born from nothingness?

496
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:07,791
I'm taking her
back with me.

497
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:09,333
Please be my guest...

498
00:22:09,416 --> 00:22:10,916
We're already finished.

499
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:16,208
So... I'm dying to
know something...

500
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:19,583
You're both extremely
valuable to Takumi Nishijo...

501
00:22:19,666 --> 00:22:20,666
but if he had to choose,

502
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,458
which one of you
is more important?

503
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:29,625
I remember this...

504
00:22:29,708 --> 00:22:31,000
The dark...

505
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:33,541
It brings back memories
of when it first began.

506
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:37,583
I woke up and I
was imprisoned,

507
00:22:37,666 --> 00:22:41,125
being used as a test subject
in some sort of experiment...

508
00:22:41,208 --> 00:22:44,208
I knew nothing of
myself before then...

509
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:47,458
My consciousness came into
being in that waking moment...

510
00:22:47,541 --> 00:22:50,083
or at least it seemed so.

511
00:22:50,166 --> 00:22:53,791
Maybe the personality that
existed in this body before me,

512
00:22:53,875 --> 00:22:56,875
erased herself inside
her own delusion.

513
00:22:56,958 --> 00:23:00,583
To escape the
terrible pain.

514
00:23:00,666 --> 00:23:02,333
Who really knows...?

515
00:23:02,416 --> 00:23:03,583
And maybe there had been

516
00:23:03,666 --> 00:23:06,208
different personalities
before her?

517
00:23:06,291 --> 00:23:07,541
Who am I?

518
00:23:12,416 --> 00:23:13,833
I'm sorry.

519
00:23:13,916 --> 00:23:16,458
I can't do this anymore.

520
00:23:16,541 --> 00:23:17,875
Hmph.

521
00:23:23,666 --> 00:23:25,208
Grim said to come.

522
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,250
I don't care...

523
00:23:35,333 --> 00:23:36,916
I don't care about
any of this anymore!

524
00:23:40,625 --> 00:23:42,500
It's just like Grim
said it would be...

525
00:23:42,583 --> 00:23:43,500
A party...

526
00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:45,125
A big party!

527
00:23:48,625 --> 00:23:49,958
It hurts...

528
00:23:50,041 --> 00:23:52,708
Please help me!

529
00:23:52,791 --> 00:23:54,541
-Seira!
-Takki...

530
00:23:54,625 --> 00:23:57,708
You silly...

531
00:23:57,791 --> 00:23:59,833
If I stay here,
someone will kill me...

532
00:23:59,916 --> 00:24:00,916
Erase me.

533
00:24:05,041 --> 00:24:07,041
Listen... You can't die yet.

534
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,083
Are you responsible
for this...?

535
00:24:10,166 --> 00:24:11,583
Did you do it?

536
00:24:11,666 --> 00:24:12,791
It's begun...

537
00:24:12,875 --> 00:24:14,291
They're on the move.

538
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:15,791
"They"?

539
00:24:15,875 --> 00:24:17,416
The ones behind it all...

540
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,000
The ones who caused
this chaos...

541
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:20,625
Don't you understand?

542
00:24:20,708 --> 00:24:22,791
You're the only one
who can stop them!

543
00:24:24,666 --> 00:24:25,833
A gunshot?

544
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:30,500
What's happening?

545
00:24:30,583 --> 00:24:32,583
Why are they
acting this way?

546
00:24:32,666 --> 00:24:34,666
It's Shibuya's GE rates...

547
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:38,000
People's biorhythms are
spiking out of control...

548
00:24:38,083 --> 00:24:40,833
The people here are under
an invisible attack,

549
00:24:40,916 --> 00:24:42,750
they don't even realize
it's happening.

550
00:24:44,708 --> 00:24:46,583
The silent weapon...

551
00:24:46,666 --> 00:24:48,708
Noah II's already
operational...

552
00:24:48,791 --> 00:24:50,041
The primary goal

553
00:24:50,125 --> 00:24:52,666
is indiscriminate human
experimentation...

554
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:53,958
You see...?

555
00:24:54,041 --> 00:24:56,583
You're the only one who
can stop it, Takumi...

556
00:24:56,666 --> 00:24:58,833
You are our only hope.

557
00:24:58,916 --> 00:25:00,416
It was you?

558
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,666
Of course...

559
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,375
I've always been watching.

560
00:25:07,333 --> 00:25:13,041
[Music]

561
00:26:43,666 --> 00:26:44,875
Those eyes...

562
00:26:44,958 --> 00:26:46,166
Whose are they?
