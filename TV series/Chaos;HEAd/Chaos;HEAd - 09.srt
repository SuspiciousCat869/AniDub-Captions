[Music]

2
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:40,458
I'm Takumi Nishijo...

3
00:01:40,541 --> 00:01:42,708
Sena, Kozzy and
I teamed up

4
00:01:42,791 --> 00:01:44,875
and went after the
Nozomi Group,

5
00:01:44,958 --> 00:01:47,541
a powerful company that is
trying to recreate the ability

6
00:01:47,625 --> 00:01:48,833
of the gigalomaniacs

7
00:01:48,916 --> 00:01:51,125
and use it for
evil purposes.

8
00:01:51,208 --> 00:01:54,083
However, company president
Genichi Norose

9
00:01:54,166 --> 00:01:56,375
was immediately
on to our plan.

10
00:01:56,458 --> 00:01:58,875
He used the power of
Noah II's prototype

11
00:01:58,958 --> 00:02:02,208
to make Sena and
Kozzy suffer...

12
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:04,208
He also tried his
best to kill me.

13
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:07,375
Suddenly a miracle
happened...

14
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:09,791
Ayase showed up and
came to our rescue.

15
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,291
But the Norose we fought
so hard to beat...

16
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:16,750
It was a delusion.

17
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:31,458
I'm so sorry, I hope you
haven't been waiting too long.

18
00:02:31,541 --> 00:02:34,083
I'm Ban, Shibuya Police.

19
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:36,500
Your name's Yua
Kusunoki, right?

20
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:37,625
Yes.

21
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:39,750
You're related to
Mia Kusunoki...

22
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:42,125
The young girl who died in
the first New Gen crime,

23
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:44,125
known commonly as
the "Group Dive"...

24
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:46,791
You two were twin
sisters, correct?

25
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,250
Well to bring you
up to speed...

26
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:50,041
Yua here has been
investigating

27
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:52,458
the New Gen incidents
all on her own...

28
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:55,125
She's trying to find out what
happened to her sister...

29
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:57,375
That must've been really
difficult for her.

30
00:02:57,458 --> 00:03:00,375
That's not all. She's narrowed
it down to one suspect.

31
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:02,333
It's Takumi Nishijo.

32
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:05,750
That's interesting...

33
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:07,500
Very much so.

34
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:10,000
So what exactly led
you to this conclusion?

35
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:12,166
Just give me one sec.

36
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:16,166
I gotta take this call.

37
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,958
Yeah, this is
Ban, what's up?

38
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:19,416
It's number six...!

39
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,458
The sixth New Gen incident
was just reported!

40
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:23,583
What was that?

41
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:27,291
The sixth case?!

42
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:28,500
No,. it can't be...

43
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:29,958
Hey what's wrong?

44
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,916
Each of the three victims'
bodies were severed,

45
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,083
all of them cut in half
at the waist...

46
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:39,125
Their upper and
lower bodies were...

47
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:40,666
all sewn up

48
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,166
and then stitched back together
again with fishing line...

49
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,666
There were wounds
on their bodies

50
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,958
resembling the letters
"D," "Q" and "N."

51
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:49,375
So gruesome.

52
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:50,500
I know these guys!

53
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:52,041
What do you mean?

54
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:55,375
Well, they, uh-They picked a
fight with me a while back.

55
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:56,666
It's the General...

56
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:59,708
He's provoking me
again, I know it!

57
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:01,500
Hey don't worry.

58
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:03,541
I'm sure it's just
a coincidence.

59
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:04,833
Plus...

60
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:06,750
I am so hungry
I can't think...

61
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:08,875
You wanna go grab
a bite to eat...?

62
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:11,708
I know an awesome place
that's super cheap.

63
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:14,166
Just give me a break...!

64
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,666
This whole thing is
driving me insane!

65
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:17,791
You got it...

66
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:19,375
You're in charge of
the crime scene...

67
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:20,541
I'd come, but I think

68
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:22,708
I'm onto a very important
lead right now.

69
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:23,875
Roger.

70
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:27,500
You may end up
opening Pandora's box

71
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:29,000
if you're not careful,
Detective.

72
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:38,291
Your temperature's at
a hundred degrees...

73
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:40,125
That's high but
not dangerous.

74
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:41,625
My head is hurting...

75
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:42,666
It's bad.

76
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,708
Oh my... Again?

77
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:46,875
Well that's a side effect
of the medication...

78
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:48,125
Just try not to
think about it

79
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:49,750
and it'll go away soon.

80
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,416
I know these symptoms...

81
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,833
I've had them before.

82
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,125
No matter what happens...

83
00:04:58,208 --> 00:05:00,583
I'm ready for
anything that comes...

84
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:01,625
Because...

85
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:03,958
I've endured the
divine punishment.

86
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:08,083
Hi-ya!

87
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,708
I can't wrap my
head around it,

88
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:16,666
why is the General
targeting me?

89
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,666
"Those eyes,
whose are they?"...

90
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,125
That's the phrase
I always say.

91
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:24,125
I even wrote an essay about
it in elementary school...

92
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:25,958
What exactly did I write?

93
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,583
You lose, you silly boy!

94
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:38,958
This is it but it
doesn't make any sense.

95
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:46,750
IR2, huh?

96
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:48,375
I know this equation,

97
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:51,041
it's the same one the
General posted online...

98
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:52,125
Oh no...

99
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:54,083
What if he's secretly
reading my mind?

100
00:05:58,083 --> 00:05:59,333
The General...

101
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:00,416
Is it him?

102
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:09,958
Nanami...

103
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:11,291
Of course.

104
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:12,666
Taku.

105
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,375
Yeah, what do you want?

106
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:16,041
Please... Help me.

107
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:19,666
Prank-calling me...

108
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,541
She's so annoying.

109
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:24,250
Yua, have you heard anything
about students at your school

110
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:27,041
performing magic tricks,
or supernatural feats?

111
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:29,250
For example, have you
ever seen anybody

112
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:31,041
pull a big sword
out of thin air?

113
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:33,166
How do you know about her?

114
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,666
Do you know her name?

115
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,875
Yes, Ayase Kishimoto.

116
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:38,583
I saw her do it...

117
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:40,000
It was incredible,

118
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:42,000
she pulled a sword
out of nowhere.

119
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:43,750
I saw the exact same thing

120
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:45,416
done by another
girl named Sena.

121
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,000
Huh?

122
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:49,666
Several reports have been
submitted by concerned citizens

123
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:53,125
who have seen this girl carrying
a sword all over the city.

124
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:55,083
Yes, but... that's not all...

125
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:57,583
I saw Ayase split in two.

126
00:06:57,666 --> 00:06:59,750
Just like that,
there were two of her!

127
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:03,541
I've already confirmed
that Ayase and Sena

128
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:05,875
have separately made contact
with Takumi Nishijo

129
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:07,333
in the past few days.

130
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:10,000
Takumi.

131
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:11,500
I may not be able
to explain it,

132
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:13,041
but everywhere that boy goes,

133
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:16,500
strange and mysterious things
seem to be right behind him.

134
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:18,000
Oh, by the way, Yua...

135
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:20,125
Those little charmy things
hanging from your bag...

136
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:21,541
Those are the
Hoppy the Frog dolls

137
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:23,541
that are so popular with
all the kids, aren't they?

138
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:25,625
Oh yeah.

139
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:26,916
I think I'd like one.

140
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,750
Would you mind
picking one up for me?

141
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:30,416
Of course,
I'd be happy to.

142
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,250
What the hell's
Hoppy the Frog?

143
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:33,541
It's a teenager thing,

144
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:36,333
a few specialty shops
in town sell them... Duh.

145
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:38,375
On Fridays kids line up
all the way around the block

146
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,625
to get one.

147
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:41,125
On Fridays, huh?

148
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:43,041
Yep, every Friday
new designs come out.

149
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:44,875
People look forward
to it all week long.

150
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:46,583
You thinking
the same thing?

151
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,583
Hoppy the Frog sales
aren't the only thing

152
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:50,833
spiking on the weekend.

153
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:52,791
Let's check this thing out.

154
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:56,458
Taku...

155
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:57,583
Hey, Taku!

156
00:07:58,750 --> 00:07:59,916
Where the heck
is Ayase's room?

157
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,208
I've got no clue.

158
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:02,958
This is the
outpatient ward...

159
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:04,416
In-patients
are over there.

160
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,166
What are you,
a tour guide...?

161
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,958
You sure know a lot
about this place.

162
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:10,875
Well at least somebody
knows what's going on...

163
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,333
You invited us to come,

164
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:13,833
you should at
least know the way.

165
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:15,625
Actually, I only
invited Taku...

166
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:17,583
You just decided
to crash the party.

167
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:18,791
Did I really?

168
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:21,750
Well, I'm going
to the bathroom,

169
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:23,666
you guys go on ahead,
I'll catch up with you later.

170
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:24,791
Cool.

171
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:33,833
Where do you
think she went?

172
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:35,000
Hell, I don't know.

173
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:39,041
The "Gladiale Saga"?

174
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:40,958
It looks like a
fantasy novel.

175
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:43,250
If I'm going to make
Ayase fall in love with me,

176
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:45,583
I'm probably gonna have to
read this book, aren't I?

177
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:48,750
I guess Ayase's well
enough to walk then.

178
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:50,125
By the way,
do you think

179
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:51,583
Rimi's gonna be able
to find this room?

180
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:53,416
Huh?

181
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,916
Rimi's not exactly the
smartest person I've ever met,

182
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,833
so I highly doubt it
occurred to her to stop

183
00:08:57,916 --> 00:08:59,583
and ask somebody
for assistance.

184
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:00,791
We should go find her.

185
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:03,125
Hey wait a second.

186
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:04,708
That thing I heard
about you and Ayase

187
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:07,791
sleeping together was
just a rumor, right?

188
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:10,875
I mean, you look so lonely
when Rimi's not by your side.

189
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:14,958
Well... I'll check downstairs.

190
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:16,000
Then I'll go up.

191
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:38,958
Why do I feel this way,

192
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:40,416
like I shouldn't be here?

193
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:50,625
What is this place?

194
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,500
Oh no...

195
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:57,666
No!

196
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:02,500
The General...

197
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:04,416
He's reading my
thoughts again...!

198
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,000
I wanna go home!

199
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:09,000
May the divine
light save you...

200
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:11,166
May the divine
light defend you...

201
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,208
May the divine
light protect you...

202
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:15,125
May the divine
light cleanse you.

203
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:18,625
Oh wow...

204
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:21,041
Takumi is a full-blown
anime nerd, isn't he?

205
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:25,958
Takumi Nishijo
is not normal.

206
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:29,041
What if somebody is giving
him artificial support...?

207
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:30,375
What will we do?

208
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:37,750
Cool...

209
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:39,458
"Those eyes,
whose are they?"...

210
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:43,083
I guess Takumi really is the
"Whose eyes" guy after all.

211
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:45,458
I knew it was
him all along!

212
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:47,208
No way.

213
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:49,500
"Ir2"?

214
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:50,583
Well, what's that?

215
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,125
Are you okay?

216
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,833
What in the
world was that?

217
00:10:57,916 --> 00:10:59,416
Hey, Taku.

218
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,208
You don't look so good...

219
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:05,125
But I guess you
never really do, huh?

220
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:06,833
I found Rimi and Ayase.

221
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,250
Look right down there.

222
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:18,625
What was that
all about...?

223
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:21,208
Do those two hold
some kind of grudge?

224
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:22,416
Anyway...

225
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,333
Let's pretend we
didn't see that.

226
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:25,458
Yeah.

227
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:29,250
Yo, Ayase!

228
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:31,750
Just thought you'd
like to know,

229
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:33,166
you look hot in your PJs...

230
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,583
Right, Taku?

231
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:46,791
How do you feel...?

232
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:48,125
You sure do look a
whole lot better.

233
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:50,250
Hey...! Ayase...

234
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:51,625
Do you like books...?

235
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:52,708
I'm reading one that's
called the Gladiale Saga...

236
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:54,625
Takumi... You do realize

237
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:56,375
you're one of the
Seven Knights of Gladiale.

238
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:00,375
You have a great
wickedness inside of you...

239
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:03,041
That's what makes you
an ideal Black Knight...

240
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:05,250
It's why you've
been chosen...

241
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:07,125
All the pain and suffering
you're experiencing

242
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:08,541
is divine punishment...

243
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:11,250
The Great Will of the
Universe is testing you.

244
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:13,000
Once you have overcome it,
you will be free again,

245
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:15,458
and the di- sword
will be summoned.

246
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:16,541
Trust me...

247
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:18,583
I know it.

248
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:20,208
It will appear
before you...

249
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:22,125
A great black serpent...

250
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,208
It will swallow
up all destruction

251
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:27,000
and take down the
evil King Gladiale...

252
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:28,916
This is the
path you are on.

253
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,833
Together we will
destroy the King...

254
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,125
We must.

255
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:35,708
Well... To be honest,

256
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:37,333
I have no idea
what's going on...

257
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:39,250
She's all yours, pal...

258
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:40,958
Good luck!

259
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:44,291
Daisuke, leaving me all
alone isn't gonna help.

260
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:46,791
You created it,
didn't you?

261
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:48,208
You made the flowerbed.

262
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:50,750
You gotta understand,
I'm not a gigalomaniac...

263
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:52,041
I don't think.

264
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:54,125
Gigalo... what?

265
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:56,458
You don't know what a
gigalomaniac is...?

266
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:58,125
That girl Sena
told me about it.

267
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:00,083
Oh, that girl,
I know her...

268
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:01,750
She is a Knight
of Gladiale too,

269
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:03,166
just like you and I are.

270
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,208
Listen to me,
I am not a knight...

271
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:06,208
I'm not...

272
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:07,750
I don't have a di-sword...

273
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:09,125
I've got nothing.

274
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:10,958
It's your divine
punishment...

275
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:13,666
Once you overcome it,
your sword will be revealed.

276
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,291
Punishment?

277
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:16,458
Your suffering...

278
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:18,166
The explosion of
emotional burdens

279
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,583
burying themselves deep
inside your mind...

280
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:21,625
In other words...

281
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:24,708
Psychological torture.

282
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:26,083
I experienced it...

283
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:39,083
The drops of water
fell into my eyes

284
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:41,750
in precisely
five-second intervals.

285
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:43,333
It went on like that...

286
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:45,666
for two weeks without
a moment's rest.

287
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:53,416
The instant before my
mind was about to break...

288
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,041
I could hear the voice
of the Great Will.

289
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:58,125
And I was finally
able to summon it.

290
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:01,250
That was divine
punishment...

291
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:03,375
In order to get the power
to defeat the demon,

292
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:06,625
you have to purify your own,
and cleanse it from within.

293
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:08,250
What are you saying...?

294
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:11,041
That I have to keep
on suffering...?

295
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:13,083
I don't want to do this...

296
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:15,458
Please, I just want
to be left alone!

297
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:17,291
It's all a revelation.

298
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:18,833
We're running
out of time,

299
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:21,208
the Seven Knights should've
already gathered in this city...

300
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:23,208
The moment has come,
they must awaken!

301
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,000
If we don't do
something quickly,

302
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:28,916
the world will fall to
ruin by Gladiale's hand.

303
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,208
I'm sorry, guys...

304
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:31,916
I didn't know where
the hospital room was,

305
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,541
so I got lost
wandering around.

306
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:36,833
So... Did you
get to see Ayase?

307
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:39,375
Yeah, but I don't really
care about Ayase anymore.

308
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:43,208
She's way too
crazy for me...

309
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:45,708
Plus I don't like
fantasy novels.

310
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:47,250
Did something happen?

311
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:49,083
Oh yeah...
You could say that.

312
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,166
Another prank call?

313
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:58,791
Hey, Nanami, cut it out!

314
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:00,541
Taku...

315
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:03,166
Where am I?

316
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,500
Please help me...

317
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:06,291
I wanna go home!

318
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:07,291
Nana...

319
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:12,750
This place is dead...

320
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:14,791
Guess there aren't a lot of
customers before the weekend.

321
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:16,083
Yeah...

322
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:17,458
It's 'cause it's the
middle of the week.

323
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:20,083
From Friday to Sunday it's
pretty crowded in here.

324
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:22,083
Um... In other words...

325
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:24,250
it's not usually very
busy until the weekend

326
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:26,250
when a new Hoppy
gets released.

327
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:28,583
So it only happens
on the weekends, eh?

328
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:30,208
Oh... look!

329
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:31,125
What's wrong?

330
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:34,958
That must be the new
Floppy the Frog

331
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:36,458
that goes on sale tomorrow.

332
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:38,291
Uh... Actually,
it's Hoppy the Frog.

333
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:40,458
Well, well, looky there...

334
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:42,250
The Shinko Corporation.

335
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:45,750
I'm worried
about Nanami...

336
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:47,666
What if it wasn't a prank?

337
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,125
What's the matter, Taku?

338
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:51,041
You're acting a
little weird...

339
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:52,916
Is everything okay?

340
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,958
I'm just a little bit
worried about my sister.

341
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:56,958
I think I should go
home and check on her.

342
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:58,416
Oh... So you're going home?

343
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,250
Yeah... Would you
come with me please...

344
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:02,125
I really don't wanna
go there alone.

345
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:06,083
Sena?

346
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:08,291
Are you the one who
drew this picture?

347
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:09,583
Answer me!

348
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:11,708
What in the world is
she doing with that?

349
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:13,791
I asked you a question!

350
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:16,000
Yeah, I did, so what?

351
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:18,208
Takumi, run, now!

352
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:20,583
Prepare yourself!

353
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:21,791
Look out!

354
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:25,166
Why is Sena attacking me?

355
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:29,958
Wait, what did I do wrong?

356
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:34,041
Rimi.

357
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:35,041
Move!

358
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:36,875
Stop it... Stop it!

359
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,250
What the hell is this?!

360
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:44,750
Rimi is one of us.

361
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:47,041
She's a gigalomaniac, too!

362
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:49,333
Stop it, you
leave him alone!

363
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:51,541
But don't you realize what
this idiot created...?

364
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:53,625
He's responsible for
the IR2 equation!

365
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:54,791
Yes, I know.

366
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:55,916
Then move.

367
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,625
If you cause
him to awaken,

368
00:16:57,708 --> 00:16:59,500
things won't
get any better.

369
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:01,708
I'll kill him before that.

370
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:03,541
You won't be able to.

371
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:19,916
Sena.

372
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,416
It's you.

373
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,083
I finally found you.

374
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,750
I didn't know
what else to do...

375
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:42,208
I had no other alternative

376
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:44,125
but to offer your
mother as a sacrifice,

377
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:45,500
can't you understand that?

378
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:46,791
Shut up.

379
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:48,125
Because of your mother,

380
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:50,250
we were able to achieve
unparalleled results...

381
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:52,375
Her death was useful
in our experiments.

382
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:53,416
Shut the hell up!

383
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,458
At last...

384
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,083
I've finally avenged her.

385
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:07,250
Sena.

386
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:09,583
No, stop it...!

387
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:12,208
Please let go of me!

388
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:13,708
It's okay.

389
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:15,250
No... Let go...

390
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:16,708
I don't want this.

391
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:19,333
But this is the delusion
that you wished for.

392
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:23,083
Sena!

393
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:29,083
I'm sorry for causing
you all this pain...

394
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:31,166
But you left me
no other option.

395
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:37,625
Did Rimi just
do that to her?

396
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:39,083
It's over now, right...?

397
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:41,083
You'll leave her be,
won't you, Rimi?

398
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:42,916
If you're a big
meanie head to Sena

399
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,250
and try to cause
her any more pain,

400
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:47,500
I promise I'll never
ever forgive you.

401
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:49,416
It's all over
now, I swear.

402
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,041
I really didn't
want to hurt her,

403
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:52,791
that was never
my intention...

404
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:54,708
If she promises to
keep away from Taku,

405
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:56,041
then I'll leave her alone.

406
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:57,416
That's not gonna work...

407
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,125
It's just not possible...

408
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:01,000
I mean, the three
of us are friends.

409
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:03,083
We do stuff together
all the time, right?

410
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:04,166
Right...?

411
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,000
Tell her how
it is, Takumi.

412
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:10,791
Because of what you've done,
my family is ruined!

413
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:12,625
Whadda you mean,
your family?

414
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:18,833
The formula you created,

415
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:21,000
it has potential to
destroy the world...

416
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:22,500
It's the most
dangerous equation

417
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:24,166
that has ever
been conceived...

418
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,458
And it's the cause
of all the chaos

419
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:27,416
that's assaulting our city!

420
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,791
Equation?

421
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:29,625
Don't say any more.

422
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:30,833
Just drop it.

423
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:32,416
But what do you mean?

424
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,875
Hey is this it...?

425
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:34,958
The formula?

426
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:40,541
That's just a drawing,
it's nothing!

427
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:43,458
F U N to the tenth
power times I N T

428
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:46,583
to the fortieth power
equals... I R two.

429
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:48,333
The moment you
created this equation

430
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:49,708
the world split in two...

431
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:51,041
You destroyed everything!

432
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,875
This equation is the principal
mathematical component

433
00:19:57,958 --> 00:19:59,958
behind the functionality
of Noah II.

434
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:01,583
The formula is
incorporated

435
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:03,333
into the core of
the system...

436
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:07,166
Remarkably, we discovered it in
the most unusual of places.

437
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:10,208
A young child scribbled
it while drawing...

438
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:12,041
Yes, "IR two"...

439
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:13,500
Thanks to this
simple equation,

440
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:15,875
Noah II's mechanism was
taken to the next level,

441
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:17,083
its hardware achieving

442
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:19,541
what you might call
god-like ability.

443
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:20,833
Now all we have to do

444
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:23,291
is continue to gather
gigalomaniac code samples

445
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:24,833
for Noah II's software,

446
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:27,750
and the program will begin to
operate at full capacity...

447
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:29,041
just like that.

448
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:30,250
How many samples
have you gathered?

449
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:31,750
Where do we stand?

450
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:33,625
I have already
secured samples

451
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:35,166
from five different people.

452
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,208
Then things are
right on track.

453
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:38,333
But remember this,

454
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:40,208
the more samples
we can get...

455
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:42,791
the more powerful the
Noah II will become...

456
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,083
With your permission,

457
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:46,208
there is one gigalomaniac
boy in particular

458
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:48,583
whose sample I am
planning on collecting.

459
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:49,958
That's fine,

460
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:52,000
so long as it does not
cause a delay in our plans.

461
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:54,625
How long until Noah
II's fully operational?

462
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:56,041
Before we move on,

463
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:58,333
I must conduct one
final experiment...

464
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:00,416
I will initiate
the third melt.

465
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,875
Wait, the third melt?

466
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:03,541
I believe it will be
on the level of the

467
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:05,458
Great Kanto Earthquake.

468
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:07,916
The Kanto Earthquake,
are you serious?

469
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,416
That was the greatest
natural disaster

470
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,708
this country has seen.

471
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:12,041
After the third melt

472
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:13,625
successfully achieves
its result,

473
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:15,583
Noah II will have
attained near perfection

474
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:17,208
in its final form...

475
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:21,041
The world's possibilities
will be in our hands.

476
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:22,166
IR2...

477
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:25,208
The formula that
creates silent weapons.

478
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:27,500
But what are the
silent weapons?

479
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:28,791
Mind reading...

480
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:30,125
Visual projection...

481
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:31,833
Sensory control...

482
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:33,291
With this...

483
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:36,458
gigalomaniacs will never
be special beings again...

484
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:38,416
This power will be
available to anyone

485
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,208
to use indiscriminately.

486
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:43,208
And it is all thanks
to the Noah II machine

487
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:44,958
derived from
your equation.

488
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:46,208
The Noah II.

489
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:47,750
We saw it!

490
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:49,125
What's worse...

491
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:51,625
People will never
know about this...

492
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:54,083
Norose and those corrupt
bastards will monopolize it

493
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:55,791
before people
ever realize.

494
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:58,875
But that's got
nothing to do with me!

495
00:21:58,958 --> 00:22:00,250
Look I'm not to
blame for this,

496
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:01,791
I didn't hurt anybody!

497
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:04,208
If I don't even remember
writing the stupid thing

498
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:05,875
then how can
it be my fault?

499
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:07,708
None of this
really matters.

500
00:22:07,791 --> 00:22:08,958
The important thing
is the person

501
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:11,208
who came up with the
"Those eyes" phrase.

502
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:13,875
And that's you, Takumi,
you made it up...!

503
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:17,541
See, the old man knew exactly
what he was talking about!

504
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:18,666
What's that...?

505
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:20,416
What old man are
you talking about?

506
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,791
Well, let's see.

507
00:22:21,875 --> 00:22:23,875
He was the person who
originally told me

508
00:22:23,958 --> 00:22:25,750
how important
di-swords were.

509
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:30,791
I remember him 'cause he
was the first one in town

510
00:22:30,875 --> 00:22:32,958
to speak to me.

511
00:22:33,041 --> 00:22:35,250
Why didn't you tell me
about this sooner, Kozue?!

512
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:36,250
I'm sorry!

513
00:22:36,333 --> 00:22:37,916
How was I
supposed to know?

514
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,166
It's true...

515
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:41,666
He's really in this city.

516
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:43,791
I'll finally get
my revenge...

517
00:22:43,875 --> 00:22:45,166
Finally...

518
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:46,833
I will kill him!

519
00:22:52,208 --> 00:22:53,625
I'm sorry...

520
00:22:53,708 --> 00:22:55,083
I'm sorry I lied.

521
00:22:59,208 --> 00:23:01,500
I don't even know
who you are anymore.

522
00:23:01,583 --> 00:23:03,083
Taku...

523
00:23:03,166 --> 00:23:04,666
I think of myself
as your friend,

524
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:05,958
I don't want to lose you...

525
00:23:06,041 --> 00:23:08,333
Please just trust me.

526
00:23:08,416 --> 00:23:10,083
Rimi.

527
00:23:10,166 --> 00:23:12,875
Can I trust her after all
the lies and deceit...?

528
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:15,000
If I ask her if
she's on my side

529
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:17,291
do I run the risk of
losing her forever...?

530
00:23:17,375 --> 00:23:18,541
No.

531
00:23:18,625 --> 00:23:20,041
You saved me...

532
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:22,166
Thank you for
the protection.

533
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:23,583
You're welcome.

534
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,041
Stop...!

535
00:23:31,125 --> 00:23:33,041
Hold on.

536
00:23:33,125 --> 00:23:34,541
Are you really
going home...?

537
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:35,958
Please don't do that...

538
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:38,250
Things there will never
be the same again.

539
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:40,458
I don't want you
to have to hurt.

540
00:23:40,541 --> 00:23:41,666
Let's go back...

541
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,083
We'll go back to
your secret hideout

542
00:23:43,166 --> 00:23:44,125
and play games...

543
00:23:44,208 --> 00:23:45,375
As long as you want,

544
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:47,708
I'll stay right by your
side, Taku, I swear.

545
00:23:47,791 --> 00:23:49,958
We can walk to school together
and gossip with Daisuke

546
00:23:50,041 --> 00:23:51,333
about all the things
that are happening.

547
00:23:51,416 --> 00:23:52,666
You don't get it...

548
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:54,625
It's Nanami,
I've got to see her.

549
00:23:54,708 --> 00:23:55,791
She's not there...

550
00:23:55,875 --> 00:23:57,375
She's gone.

551
00:23:57,458 --> 00:23:59,916
Taku... It hurts me
to see you sad...

552
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,666
Please don't go.

553
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:03,958
Stop being so mysterious!

554
00:24:04,041 --> 00:24:06,708
Look, if there's a reason I
shouldn't go home, tell me...!

555
00:24:06,791 --> 00:24:07,708
Don't make me guess,

556
00:24:07,791 --> 00:24:08,916
I'm so sick and tired

557
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,125
of all this speaking
in riddles bullshit!

558
00:24:12,208 --> 00:24:13,125
Taku.

559
00:24:21,041 --> 00:24:22,583
This is the right street.

560
00:24:22,666 --> 00:24:24,166
Where is it...?

561
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:25,541
Where's my house?

562
00:24:25,625 --> 00:24:27,083
Don't you get it, Taku...?

563
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:29,250
There's no home in this
world for you to go to.

564
00:25:07,333 --> 00:25:13,041
[Music]

565
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:44,708
Those eyes...

566
00:26:44,791 --> 00:26:46,125
Whose are they?
