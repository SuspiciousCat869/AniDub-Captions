2
00:01:38,791 --> 00:01:39,875
You know...

3
00:01:39,958 --> 00:01:42,291
I don't have
much time left...

4
00:01:42,375 --> 00:01:44,625
I was born with
this disease...

5
00:01:44,708 --> 00:01:47,166
I first showed symptoms
when I was ten years old

6
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,708
and I stopped
maturing normally...

7
00:01:49,791 --> 00:01:52,333
And then I started
to age rapidly.

8
00:01:52,416 --> 00:01:53,791
Why don't you just
heal yourself

9
00:01:53,875 --> 00:01:55,833
with your gigalomaniac power?

10
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:58,625
Unfortunately, the
more I use that power,

11
00:01:58,708 --> 00:02:01,083
the more severe my
disease becomes.

12
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:03,958
As a result, I
can't heal myself...

13
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:06,500
It's the one thing
my power can't touch.

14
00:02:06,583 --> 00:02:08,583
No matter how
hard I try...

15
00:02:08,666 --> 00:02:10,250
Nothing will change it.

16
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:13,166
What about after you die,
what will happen to me?

17
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,958
Even though you and I
are the same person,

18
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:17,250
regardless of anything
that happens to me,

19
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:20,958
once you were real-booted you
became a separate human being.

20
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:23,041
Even if I die...

21
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:25,916
you will continue
to live on.

22
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,416
What if I disappear,
will you be saved then?

23
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,833
It's useless...

24
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:32,166
That's just prolonging
the inevitable...

25
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,833
My life on this
earth is over...

26
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:37,500
You need to destroy
Noah II, Takumi...

27
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:38,708
Use your power...

28
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:41,875
without a single
regard for my life.

29
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:43,625
I don't need you
to tell me that...

30
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:46,041
I'm not nice enough to
hold back on your account.

31
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:52,541
I'm happy you
finally awakened.

32
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:54,416
I will leave
the rest to you.

33
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:57,500
So that's it...?

34
00:02:57,583 --> 00:02:59,000
You dump this on me?!

35
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:00,958
I'm a little tired...

36
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:02,375
Let me sleep.

37
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:06,833
I know who I am...

38
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:09,791
And I know what my
purpose is in this life...

39
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:12,375
Rimi, I will save her.

40
00:03:20,916 --> 00:03:22,250
Amazing...

41
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:24,750
I never dreamed Noah II
would be so powerful.

42
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:27,833
It will play a vital role
in restoring our city...

43
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,041
The Meiwa Party's approval
ratings will rise

44
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:32,041
and we will flourish.

45
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:34,958
And we couldn't have done any
of this without you, Chairman.

46
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:36,208
May the divine
light save you.

47
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:39,625
Let us welcome the dawn

48
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:42,250
of the Church of Natural Divine
Light and the Meiwa Party

49
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:44,750
as we work together to
achieve all our goals.

50
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:46,250
We've put an enormous
amount of money

51
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:47,333
into Project Noah.

52
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:49,000
Let us hope it bears fruit.

53
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:51,125
Yes, of course
gentlemen...

54
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:53,166
You were expecting
an equivalent return

55
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,541
on your investment.

56
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:56,958
But regardless of elections
or gaining followers,

57
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:58,375
at the end of the day,

58
00:03:58,458 --> 00:04:01,625
every person in this country
is under my influence.

59
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:02,875
What did you just say?

60
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:04,875
Have you forgotten
who you work for?

61
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:08,208
I'm assuming full control
of this project now...

62
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:10,083
Because, you see, our goals
are a little different.

63
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:12,291
Mine aren't nearly
as vulgar...

64
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:15,291
Everything that I do is
for a much nobler purpose.

65
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:16,708
What, are you
betraying us now?!

66
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:18,375
You think you'll become
some sort of god?

67
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,166
I don't think I'll
become a god...

68
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,958
Don't you see, gentlemen...?

69
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:24,041
I already am a god.

70
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:25,125
That's enough!

71
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:29,375
Yes I think this
should do the trick.

72
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:32,041
You've been blinded by
greed, but that ends now.

73
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:33,500
You monster.

74
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:34,916
I don't think so.

75
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:37,833
You're the monster.

76
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,708
Noah II's power is mine...

77
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:48,708
It appears evil men like
you wouldn't understand that.

78
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:51,875
You use tricks to avoid
getting your hands dirty...

79
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,083
But you're still
responsible...

80
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:56,041
Don't you see?
You're the evil one.

81
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:03,125
Tell me, why haven't you asked
Takumi Nishijo for help yet?

82
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:05,166
Taku's got nothing
to do with this.

83
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,041
Did you know that
he's already awakened?

84
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,458
No way.

85
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:11,416
I imagine he'll make his
way through the trials

86
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,166
and arrive here soon.

87
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,208
And after I retrieve
his code sample,

88
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:18,500
Noah II will be one step
closer to perfection...

89
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:22,416
Then I'll achieve power
on the level of the gods!

90
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,333
Taku.

91
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,458
Rimi

92
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:28,666
Takki.

93
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:29,833
Seira?

94
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:32,083
I'm over here.

95
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:33,125
Seira!

96
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:34,541
You're so mean,
leaving me behind.

97
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,791
How could you?

98
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:37,958
I'm sorry.

99
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:40,916
Oh, Takki, I'm so lonely.

100
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,125
Seira.

101
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:43,833
Hey, Takki, will you
come play with me?

102
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:45,750
Let's do something that
feels really good...

103
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:47,083
Okay, Takki?

104
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:49,458
I miss you, Takki!

105
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:51,416
What is this,
another delusion?

106
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,833
What's wrong, you
don't like it?

107
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:54,375
Is this what I wished for?

108
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:56,583
Well, of course it is,
you silly boy.

109
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:58,083
I'm sorry, but
I can't do this.

110
00:05:58,166 --> 00:05:59,583
I have to go save Rimi.

111
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:01,500
Huh?

112
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:04,000
Why don't you just
forget about her?!

113
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:05,583
Don't you wanna play
with me anymore?!

114
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:07,333
Takki!

115
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:08,291
Seira, no!

116
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,750
There's too many!

117
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:13,875
I got this!

118
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:15,083
Cocytus!

119
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:19,458
Nice work.
Thanks, Ayase.

120
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:21,000
Let's hurry.

121
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:22,375
We should get him
somewhere safe.

122
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:24,833
I know, why don't we
take him to Taku's place?

123
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:26,333
Good call...
That should be safe...

124
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:28,833
Hey, what happened?

125
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:31,958
Takumi.

126
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:34,708
He's telling us he
isn't our top priority.

127
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:36,625
Let's find Takumi
and destroy Noah II.

128
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:38,041
He might need our help.

129
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:40,583
Is that what he wants,
for us to take down Noah II?

130
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:44,583
Hey, guys!

131
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:45,750
Hey, Kozue...

132
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:47,958
You're really talking.

133
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:49,916
I can't believe
I'm crying...

134
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,625
It's ridiculous.

135
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:53,250
No, it's not, Sena...

136
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:55,250
Every single time
a person sheds a tear,

137
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:57,750
they move on to the
next stage of life.

138
00:06:57,833 --> 00:06:59,458
We cross one river
of sadness...

139
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:02,458
and another river waits
just on the other side...

140
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:04,333
It never ends...

141
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:06,250
But because of
that vicious cycle,

142
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:07,625
we're strong.

143
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:10,833
After Takumi saved
me that day...

144
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:13,458
I realized that truth.

145
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:14,791
But wait a second...

146
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:16,083
Where is Takumi?

147
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:17,958
He's gone to
destroy Noah II.

148
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:19,625
-He went that way.
-Taku.

149
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:22,250
We're going to follow
them there, Sena...

150
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:23,375
Will you come?

151
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:24,416
Sena?

152
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,791
I will...

153
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:28,250
But it's the same for
me as it was for him...

154
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:30,583
I'm doing this for myself.

155
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:31,875
The Black Knights...

156
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:33,083
United at last.

157
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,291
Man, I got dumped.

158
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:08,958
Rimi!

159
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:15,750
Oh no.

160
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:16,958
No...

161
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:18,458
Taku...

162
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:19,583
Why'd you come?

163
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,625
Why...? To save you.

164
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:23,750
But why...?
You're a fool...

165
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:26,583
Taku... What if something
happens to you?

166
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:28,791
I told you to wait
for me at your place,

167
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,291
why didn't you listen...?

168
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:33,000
Why...? Tell me.

169
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:34,833
Because... I love you...

170
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:37,625
I have always
loved you, Rimi.

171
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:39,208
Taku... Taku!

172
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:43,958
You should be commended
for your bravery.

173
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:45,291
You bastard.

174
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:48,125
However, you have made
one fatal mistake here...

175
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:50,083
You didn't think this
thing through clearly

176
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:52,750
because your actions are
based purely on emotions.

177
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,375
Do you really
think it's evil

178
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:57,208
to sacrifice smaller
things for the greater good?

179
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:59,416
Personally I don't think so...

180
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,500
If nothing changes,
mankind will be destroyed.

181
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:05,250
And do you know
what will cause it?

182
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:07,458
It truly is an
ugly emotion...

183
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:10,125
Each man thinking
only of himself...

184
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:13,833
In the end it only results
in conflict and destruction.

185
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:16,958
It's greed, the strongest
of all weaknesses.

186
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,333
I came into existence
at a very young age,

187
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:22,583
so I've had the benefit of
seeing the potential danger

188
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:23,916
for several decades...

189
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,125
And then one day
I realized...

190
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:27,958
in order for the world
to be a better place

191
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:29,791
changing the social
structure of a society

192
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:32,166
won't get the job done...

193
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,875
It's the human heart
that needs changing.

194
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:36,250
The human soul
must be reborn.

195
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:38,833
With Noah II, we can erase
all negative emotions

196
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:41,583
from mankind and purify
the whole world...

197
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:43,958
We'll cleanse their
hearts once and for all...

198
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,958
War will be no more.

199
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:47,750
And human beings all
across the world

200
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:50,208
will finally live
in eternal peace...

201
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:52,416
I suppose you won't be
looked down on as

202
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,708
an outcast anymore either.

203
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:55,791
Maybe you're right...

204
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:57,833
Maybe everything
you say is true...

205
00:09:57,916 --> 00:09:58,791
It could be...

206
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:00,083
I don't know...

207
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,541
But still.

208
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:03,958
You're just satisfying
your own greed!

209
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:06,291
-It really is a shame.
-Rimi!

210
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:08,708
In order for Noah II to
achieve its full potential

211
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:11,041
I need to extract the
final code sample from you.

212
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:23,041
Taku.

213
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:31,833
-No!
-Taku...

214
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:33,083
Do it, destroy it now!

215
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:42,166
What the hell happened?

216
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,000
I just put my sword
right through that thing!

217
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:48,291
Again?

218
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:49,708
I meant to turn around...

219
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:51,333
No I did turn around...

220
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:53,458
But it's like it
never happened.

221
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:54,583
What's going on?

222
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:56,041
What do you think?

223
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:58,833
You've just experienced
Noah II's self defense function.

224
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:00,375
It's quite
impressive actually.

225
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:02,166
The system interferes
with the minds of anyone

226
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,291
who tries to harm it.

227
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:05,291
Nobody can get
close to Noah II.

228
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:07,208
Nobody except me,
of course!

229
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:12,458
Oh no, he broke my sword!

230
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:16,041
How about I erase your
existence for you?

231
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:17,041
No!

232
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:18,125
Don't do it...

233
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:20,500
Leave him be.

234
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:21,583
Rimi...

235
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:23,875
She's trying to save
my life again...

236
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:25,583
I came here to rescue her.

237
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:27,166
I'm so pathetic.

238
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:29,458
Taku... Stop it.

239
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:33,000
No...!

240
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:35,541
Taku!

241
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:38,416
Why...?

242
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,083
Why am I doing this...?

243
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:42,166
I don't get it,
why am I making her cry?

244
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,625
Because in the end,

245
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:45,625
this is all you ever really
wanted from her, isn't it?

246
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:47,125
That can't be true...

247
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:50,083
No I love Rimi,
I'd never do that!

248
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:52,458
But you're going to die
soon anyway, right...?

249
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:54,291
What's the harm in
having a little fun?

250
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:56,333
This is my delusion,
isn't it...?

251
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:58,791
My weak mind is
trying to distract me

252
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:00,833
and push me towards
a different path.

253
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:02,250
My mind...

254
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:04,250
My mind is under attack...

255
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:07,083
Be strong, I can't let my
delusions get the best of me!

256
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:09,333
But Rimi pities you,
remember...?

257
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:12,083
She'll let you do anything
you want to now.

258
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:14,416
-Leave me alone!
-You are so pathetic.

259
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,625
Huh?

260
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:25,500
The stake.

261
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:27,375
It's driving into my body.

262
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:30,541
Do you wanna
hear something...?

263
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,083
The most interesting
characteristic

264
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:33,458
of this type of torture

265
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:35,791
is that it takes three
full days to die.

266
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:39,250
But while you're writhing
in horrible pain,

267
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:41,250
I'll be gathering
code samples from you

268
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:43,833
that will ensure the
success of Noah II.

269
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:45,458
This is a delusion...

270
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:47,166
It's a delusional attack...

271
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,500
If I endure it,

272
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:50,958
the whole thing will
end and I'll wake up.

273
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:53,083
The stake...

274
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:55,916
I can feel it pushing
past my organs...

275
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,625
And digging deeper into me...

276
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:01,166
I have to save Rimi...

277
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:13,000
I'm Takumi Nishijo...

278
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,208
School at Suimei Academy
has been suspended

279
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:17,666
ever since that big
earthquake happened...

280
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:18,916
But today we're back.

281
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,791
I've had a change of heart.

282
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:22,583
I've decided to take
this opportunity

283
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:26,416
to quit my shut-in lifestyle
and take school more seriously.

284
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,791
Of course, my wounds haven't
completely healed yet.

285
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,375
Taku!

286
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:32,541
Rimi.

287
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:33,666
Ten-hut...!

288
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,458
Good morning, Taku

289
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:37,625
I'm so happy you and I can walk
to school together again,

290
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:40,125
-aren't you?
-Yeah.

291
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:41,291
You okay?

292
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:43,791
Oh yeah, I'm fine.

293
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:45,125
Taku.

294
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:49,833
It's a bit early for that,
don't you think?

295
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:53,041
Nanami, cut that out.

296
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:54,416
You're gonna give
me a heart attack!

297
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,083
Good morning, Nana.

298
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:59,750
You two seem like you're
getting pretty close, huh...?

299
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:01,791
In fact, I'd say you're
closer than close...

300
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:03,291
Anyone else feel hot?

301
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:04,416
Good morning, Takumi.

302
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,458
How are you...?

303
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:06,958
Guess what...?
Yesterday was great.

304
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:08,291
I had so much fun.

305
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:09,708
Yesterday?

306
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:12,041
I displayed my new Seira
doll in my room right away...

307
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:13,750
I hope you'll
come and see it.

308
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:15,291
You'll come over,
won't you?

309
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:16,583
I hope you will.

310
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:18,000
Please will you?

311
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,708
Well, well...
Good morning, Takumi.

312
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:23,208
Hey... Ayase?

313
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:26,916
My band has a concert
coming up pretty soon...

314
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,625
-Please come.
-Can we go?

315
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:30,125
I'm inviting Takumi.

316
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:32,791
-Hi, Taku!
-Kozzy?

317
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:34,916
Good morning, everyone!

318
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,083
Hey, Takumi...

319
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:38,666
I've been dying
to tell you this.

320
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,166
Uh, what's up?

321
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,083
I've loved you forever...

322
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:44,083
-I'm yours.
-Huh?

323
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:45,208
What?

324
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:47,250
What did you say?

325
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:48,458
You heard what I said.

326
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:49,708
Hey!

327
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:50,875
What's the matter?

328
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:52,000
You got a problem
with that, pink hair?

329
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:53,500
I most certainly do!

330
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:54,500
He's mine.

331
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:55,833
Wow this is like heaven...

332
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:57,416
I hope this
goes on forever.

333
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:09,250
Oh no... Was I just hiding
inside my own delusion?

334
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Huh...? Who did
he just shoot?

335
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:15,958
Rimi!

336
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:21,000
Rimi! I... I couldn't protect
you, I'm so worthless.

337
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,916
There's no point in
going on anymore.

338
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:28,125
Taku...

339
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:29,125
Taku!

340
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:32,750
Huh?

341
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:35,250
-Taku... You're awake!
-Rimi!

342
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:37,541
So you're back from your
little daydream I see...

343
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:39,708
I have to admit that was
pretty clever actually,

344
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:42,041
I never imagined you would
give yourself another delusion

345
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:43,541
right in the middle
of my attack!

346
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:49,083
Rimi, run!

347
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:52,666
I won't!

348
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:53,750
Just go.

349
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,375
I have to save Rimi,
I don't have a choice.

350
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:59,500
No!

351
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:00,375
I can save her...

352
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:01,666
I can...

353
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,208
Huh...? What's
happening to me?

354
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:05,958
What sort of state
am I in right now?

355
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:10,166
In the end, human beings
only have the ability

356
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,875
to see a clear
picture of themselves

357
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:14,208
when they are looking
through another person's eyes...

358
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:16,208
And you are a
delusive existence.

359
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:18,541
You're real,
not a delusion.

360
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:20,125
Who's there?

361
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:21,041
Just look.

362
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:24,375
It's them.

363
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:25,875
We're here.

364
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:27,083
It's time.

365
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,458
Hold on.

366
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:32,125
We have to let
Cocytus assimilate

367
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:33,625
with the spiking GE rates.

368
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:34,708
But that's impossible,

369
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:36,291
there's no river of
lamentation here,

370
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:37,583
there's no way it will work.

371
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:39,083
There's the Shibuya River.

372
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:40,666
The Shibuya River?

373
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,416
It's right underneath
the city...

374
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,166
Several rivers flow together
to form the Shibuya.

375
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:47,875
And also...
Shibuya is a valley,

376
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:49,000
so it won't be too difficult

377
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:51,166
to gather up GE Rate
energy will it?

378
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,125
That's right.

379
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:55,958
With this, we will finally
defeat the evil King Gladiale.

380
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:57,083
Let's go.

381
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,541
I was too weak to
do it myself...

382
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:02,291
But thanks to
your actions...

383
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:05,000
everyone's finally
working together.

384
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:06,250
You're giving me
too much credit,

385
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:07,875
I'm not special...

386
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:11,083
Besides I was created
by a delusion, remember?

387
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:12,958
Even if you are
a delusion...

388
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:15,500
your creation
was inevitable...

389
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:18,250
Every person is born
with a purpose...

390
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:20,708
All beings that
exist are the same...

391
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:22,000
Besides...

392
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,708
everyone's had their
eyes on you, right...?

393
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:25,833
This is it.

394
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:28,625
Your time has
come at last.

395
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:30,333
My time?

396
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,083
You... are me.

397
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:33,166
I am...

398
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:34,791
I'm you.

399
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:36,541
You're my big brother.

400
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:38,833
You are Takumi.

401
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:40,666
You're Takumi Nishijo.

402
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:43,041
You're my friend Takumi.

403
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:45,500
You are Takumi.

404
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:46,833
You're Taku.

405
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:49,166
They're right, I am me...

406
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:52,333
Even if I'm a delusion,
I'm here right now...

407
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:56,208
In this moment I exist
'cause I'm Takumi Nishijo.

408
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:58,041
-I am!
-Taku!

409
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:02,291
The fear that
closes in on me

410
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:04,666
is an illusion
inside my heart.

411
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,125
If I can follow the mystery

412
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:07,791
it will lead me
towards pleasure.

413
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:08,958
I know that...

414
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:10,625
It's FES's song.

415
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:13,333
You did it, you
beat the delusion...

416
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:15,500
I give you my
final power...

417
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:17,375
Now finish this.

418
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:19,750
Please don't cry...

419
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:21,083
Please.

420
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:22,458
I'll destroy you
once and for all,

421
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:24,208
you delusive monster!

422
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:26,125
It's true, I certainly
am a monster...

423
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:27,875
But I wished for it...

424
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:29,750
In order to save Rimi...

425
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:32,125
And to destroy
Noah II for good...

426
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:33,500
This is my delusion.

427
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:36,458
Let's finish this.

428
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:37,916
I thought that
I had him cornered,

429
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,375
but now he has
the upper hand...

430
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:40,625
I can't let this happen,

431
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:42,125
I will not allow it!

432
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:45,000
Huh?

433
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:46,833
I shut down my
sense of pain.

434
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:48,583
So you can take
any shape you want,

435
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:50,250
because you've abandoned
your physical form,

436
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:52,166
is that what you've
done, you freak?

437
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:55,375
And it's all thanks to the
delusion you placed on me.

438
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:57,708
Because of you I couldn't
maintain my human form

439
00:18:57,791 --> 00:19:00,041
so I absorbed the delusion
and then made it my own.

440
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:05,791
You can't make any more
delusions without a brain,

441
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:07,166
can you?

442
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,875
Physically attacking
him with my di-sword

443
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:10,541
isn't working...

444
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:14,250
and he absorbed the delusional
attack to erase his existence.

445
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:17,416
Takumi Nishijo isn't like
a human being anymore,

446
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,625
he's something else...

447
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:20,625
His existence is
too distorted...

448
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:21,750
He's a monster.

449
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:23,583
He's too powerful.

450
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:25,041
I should command Noah II

451
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:26,625
to attack him with a
legion of antiparticles

452
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:29,166
fueled by GE Rate power.

453
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,458
Even a monster like him

454
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:32,541
will turn to negative
matter and self- destruct

455
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:34,625
if you bombard it
with antiparticles.

456
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:36,708
Yes that's true.

457
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:37,875
He read my thoughts!

458
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:39,250
Although I'm betting

459
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:41,416
you can't read my thoughts
right now, can you?

460
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:46,375
I never knew this
place existed.

461
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:49,000
This is the river on the
lowest level of Shibuya,

462
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:50,958
it will serve
as Cocytus...

463
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:52,750
We'll use its
holy power...

464
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:53,958
And we'll combine it

465
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:56,791
with the GE Rate power
of the entire city!

466
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:59,708
Today is a day of reckoning
for all these sinners...

467
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:02,708
Anyone who ignores morality
doesn't deserve to live.

468
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:03,666
That's right, Sena...

469
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,625
Get those bastards!

470
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:07,166
-Hey, watch your mouth.
-Sorry!

471
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,791
Come on... Let's go!

472
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:13,416
Merge our
delusions into one!

473
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,750
Cocytus!

474
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:21,750
Everyone's thoughts
and feelings,

475
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:23,666
they're all trained on me.

476
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:26,166
Hmph... That's
not even possible!

477
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:29,083
Don't you know what you see
doesn't represent everything?

478
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:30,666
It's time...

479
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,750
The dark snake which swallows
up all evil will defeat you...

480
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:35,375
And Noah II...

481
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:37,541
King Gladiale will
meet his end today!

482
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:39,083
Even if you do defeat me,

483
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:41,208
no one will be able to get
close to that machine...

484
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:44,500
Noah II will operate
until the end of eternity!

485
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:46,333
It's an artificial
manmade god

486
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:49,166
that will control humanity
till the end of its existence!

487
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,000
What about you...?

488
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:53,208
You can touch it!

489
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:57,750
You are the key
to stopping it!

490
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:01,875
Have you forgotten that
little tricks like this

491
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:03,833
don't work on me?

492
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:06,541
I might be the enemy of
humanity by doing this.

493
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:08,666
But I don't want
your endless utopia,

494
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,333
or your blissful peace...

495
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:12,000
Your future without war...

496
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:15,166
I'll put a stop to it
right here, right now.

497
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,625
You hear about it in
legends all the time...

498
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:19,541
Even the gods
have a weakness...

499
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:21,833
Their love for women
overcomes them...

500
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:23,541
And I am the same way.

501
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:26,291
That's why I'll sacrifice
the happiness of all mankind

502
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:27,583
for the girl I love.

503
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,000
No way!

504
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:33,791
This dark serpent's body
was made with masses

505
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:36,333
of powerful antiparticles...

506
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:38,333
It'll cause anything that
comes in contact with it

507
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:39,750
to self-destruct...

508
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:43,500
It's a righteous, destructive,
all consuming monster!

509
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:44,416
Taku!

510
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:07,916
I refuse to believe it...

511
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,416
I will not accept it...

512
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:14,500
A real god wouldn't build
happiness on someone's pain...

513
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,041
What sort of a
life is that?

514
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:27,500
A piercing gaze falls from
the sky like rays of light.

515
00:22:51,041 --> 00:22:52,125
An angel...?

516
00:23:02,125 --> 00:23:03,250
Kill me...

517
00:23:03,333 --> 00:23:05,125
Please...

518
00:23:05,208 --> 00:23:08,250
If you don't,
the real me will...

519
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:10,000
I can't do it...

520
00:23:10,083 --> 00:23:13,000
I can't do
something like that.

521
00:23:13,083 --> 00:23:16,083
I love you even with
your weaknesses...

522
00:23:16,166 --> 00:23:17,625
You're cowardly...

523
00:23:17,708 --> 00:23:19,375
You're not strong...

524
00:23:19,458 --> 00:23:22,083
But you fought with
everything inside of you,

525
00:23:22,166 --> 00:23:24,625
just to come here
and rescue me...

526
00:23:24,708 --> 00:23:26,000
Rimi.

527
00:23:26,083 --> 00:23:27,875
I want to spend more
time with you...

528
00:23:27,958 --> 00:23:29,500
I don't want
to lose you...

529
00:23:29,583 --> 00:23:31,375
All I want is for
you to live...

530
00:23:31,458 --> 00:23:33,750
I want us to share
our lives together.

531
00:23:33,833 --> 00:23:36,750
But I'm not real, I'm
nothing but a monster.

532
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:38,500
I'm the same as you...

533
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,250
It's all right.

534
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:41,541
Yeah but...

535
00:23:41,625 --> 00:23:43,958
is it okay for me to live?

536
00:23:44,041 --> 00:23:46,666
Yes, if that's
what you wish for.

537
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:48,625
Then it's okay to live.

538
00:23:51,791 --> 00:23:52,916
Takumi...

539
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,291
Did he pass on?

540
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:03,833
Rimi...

541
00:24:03,916 --> 00:24:05,666
I have always loved you.

542
00:24:07,958 --> 00:24:10,333
Light is nothing
more than waves...

543
00:24:10,416 --> 00:24:13,083
They're actually
electromagnetic waves...

544
00:24:13,166 --> 00:24:14,541
Humans perceive
these oscillations

545
00:24:14,625 --> 00:24:16,000
as different colors.

546
00:24:16,958 --> 00:24:18,750
Taku... Those words.

547
00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:22,250
Wow.

548
00:24:23,958 --> 00:24:25,333
First pick out a color

549
00:24:25,416 --> 00:24:28,041
and then try sending it
straight to your dead spot...

550
00:24:28,125 --> 00:24:30,541
Then you'll be able to
create the color of the world.

551
00:24:30,625 --> 00:24:32,166
Just make a wish.

552
00:25:07,333 --> 00:25:13,041
