1
00:00:11,333 --> 00:00:13,791
A piercing gaze
falls from the sky

2
00:00:13,875 --> 00:00:15,125
like rays of light.

3
00:00:17,583 --> 00:00:18,458
Don't look...

4
00:00:18,541 --> 00:00:19,916
Not at me.

5
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,375
I'm so sorry.

6
00:00:58,666 --> 00:00:59,958
An angel...?

7
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:15,666
It's me and her...

8
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,375
We are the only two people
who exist in this world...

9
00:01:19,458 --> 00:01:22,666
If we were to look into
each other's eyes forever,

10
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,666
what would I see...?

11
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,000
Would my world be confined

12
00:01:26,083 --> 00:01:27,875
to what was
reflected in hers?

13
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:32,000
And what would she see...?

14
00:01:32,083 --> 00:01:33,708
Would her world
be confined to

15
00:01:33,791 --> 00:01:35,250
what was reflected in mine?

16
00:01:36,916 --> 00:01:38,375
I am everything to her...

17
00:01:39,708 --> 00:01:41,000
She is everything to me...

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
forever.

19
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:54,541
[Music]

20
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,291
Takki...!
Come on, wake up...!

21
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:50,041
Takki!

22
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,333
Seira baby!

23
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:01,750
Hey... this is exactly
the way she woke people up

24
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:03,625
in the second episode
of "Blood Tune"...

25
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:05,083
I'm in heaven!

26
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:06,666
Hurry up or you'll
be late to school.

27
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,416
Get a move-on, mister!

28
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,291
Hey!

29
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:14,083
It won't hurt anything if I
miss the first class today.

30
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:16,750
Oh boy...

31
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:19,500
You might be the laziest
person I have ever met.

32
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,875
Making a chart

33
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:22,791
outlining the maximum
number of days you can miss,

34
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:26,083
and still receive the minimum
number of credits required.

35
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:28,416
You should be ashamed
of yourself Takki.

36
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:33,416
Those eyes,
whose are they?

37
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:41,250
No way!

38
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:43,791
Yes!

39
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:45,500
Guess what he did next?

40
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:48,083
Whatever, they probably
think I'm disgusting.

41
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:51,083
But I don't care...

42
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,166
3D girls are the
ones who are gross.

43
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:56,333
Yo! Well, well, look who
decided to come to school today.

44
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:58,166
Hey Daisuke,
what's up, man?

45
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,166
As usual, you look
down in the dumps.

46
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,083
Stay up too late
playing video games?

47
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:05,375
Not to brag, but yesterday
I bagged my third girl

48
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:06,333
in this class...

49
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:07,583
A few more to go

50
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:08,875
and my collection of the
hottest chicks in school

51
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:10,041
will be complete.

52
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:11,125
Yeah right.

53
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:14,791
Yeah... I wouldn't expect

54
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:17,125
a shut-in like you
to understand...

55
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:18,291
Hey, I don't suppose
you've heard anything

56
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:20,458
about the "New Gen"
crimes, have you?

57
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:22,125
No... What's the "New Gen?"

58
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:23,666
It's what they're calling
all the weird stuff

59
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:24,625
that's been happening lately.

60
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:26,208
Get a load of this!

61
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:28,208
In a report, the eyewitness
said the criminal is a girl,

62
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:29,916
and a bona fide hotty!

63
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,958
Man, if she's as
hot as they say,

64
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:33,875
she can perpetrate
a crime on me...!

65
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,375
-I'm in love!
-Cool.

66
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:37,416
Yeah, yeah, I know
it's super cool.

67
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,625
Hey... You wanna come to
the scene of the murder

68
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:41,041
with me today...?

69
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:43,291
Maybe we'll get lucky and
bump into that sexy killer.

70
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:44,625
You know what they say?

71
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:46,666
People always return to
the scene of the crime.

72
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:50,125
No thanks.

73
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:51,125
Good talk.

74
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:56,791
Yes...! I did it!

75
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,125
Wow, Takki,
you're the best!

76
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:04,666
There's just no
denying it, is there?

77
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,708
I'm unbeatable
in this world.

78
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:08,291
That's why they call
me the Knight Heart,

79
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:09,500
I'm the best there is!

80
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:22,416
It's from Grim?

81
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,208
Your levels are
getting too easy.

82
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:25,583
How 'bout a challenge?

83
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:29,666
Reality, huh? Lame...

84
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:33,791
You know I don't care about
the three dimensional world.

85
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:35,041
The New Gen.

86
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:36,541
What's that?

87
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:37,875
"You're slipping,
Knight Heart...

88
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:39,750
Stick around and maybe
you'll learn something...

89
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,833
See ya"?

90
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:43,625
Look, Takki, there's
a link there.

91
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:47,458
There is now a common name
for the two incidents

92
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:50,458
that have happened during
recent months here in Shibuya...

93
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:52,750
First named the "Wrath
of the New Generation",

94
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:54,875
it's now called
the "New Gen."

95
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:57,416
The first case was about a group
of five high school students

96
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,416
who committed suicide by
jumping off a tall building...

97
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,041
People call this
the "Group Dive."

98
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:05,083
The second case
involved a male corpse

99
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:07,500
later found to have a
fetus stuffed inside it...

100
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:08,916
This is called the
"Pregnant Man."

101
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,916
My goodness, what is this?

102
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,416
Taku...! What gives?
Open up...!

103
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,166
It's Nanami.

104
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,708
Come on, let me in...!

105
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:17,208
Stupid brother...

106
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:19,416
You'll get it if you
don't open this door...!

107
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,083
Come on, let me in!

108
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:25,750
So you're still alive!

109
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:32,791
Ugh! It stinks in here...

110
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:35,125
Why's your bedroom always
such a disgusting mess...?

111
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:36,916
Didn't I tell you
to clean up...?

112
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,291
Don't you ever listen?

113
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:40,666
Well... Since you don't
have a girlfriend

114
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,041
who is willing to
do it for you...

115
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:44,666
and since I'm such
an amazing sibling,

116
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,250
I've decided I'm
going to help you.

117
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:48,750
No thanks.

118
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:50,041
What do you mean?

119
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:51,958
Look... This is my room...

120
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:54,833
I don't want you in here
messing everything up.

121
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:56,166
You jerk!

122
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,666
How can you be so mean to
your little sister,

123
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,625
who came all this way just to
make sure you're okay...?!

124
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:01,041
It's not fair,

125
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:02,791
why was I cursed with such
a hateful big brother

126
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:04,958
who causes me nothing
but trouble!

127
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:06,541
I don't know.

128
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:08,750
Ah... I am dying of thirst...

129
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:10,125
Let me take a sip.

130
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:18,500
You could've at least
used a cup, you know?

131
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:19,916
I am using one.

132
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:24,833
Oh, okay then.

133
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:27,541
Hey... Will you please leave?

134
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:29,166
Aren't you done
annoying me yet?

135
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,333
No actually I'm not...

136
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:34,541
I am going to help you
purchase a new cell phone.

137
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:35,791
It's Dad's idea...

138
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:38,250
That way we can
always be in touch.

139
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:40,458
You should get the
same model as me!

140
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:44,625
I can even get us matching
charms, how cool is that?

141
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:47,458
Gross, the person who
designed that should be shot.

142
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:49,250
You don't know
Hoppy the Frog...?

143
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:50,916
He's so hot right now.

144
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:55,708
High school girl
fashion trends,

145
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:58,875
there is no way he'll
ever understand that.

146
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:00,041
Whatever...

147
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:01,541
Let's go get
you a phone...

148
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,541
And just so you know, we're
not getting the same models

149
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:04,708
so we can match...

150
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:06,250
We're doing it
because Daddy says

151
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:07,375
we can get a
family discount.

152
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:09,833
-No, I don't want it!
-Why not?

153
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:12,666
Dad's paying for it, it's not
like you have to do anything.

154
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:13,875
I don't need one.

155
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:20,333
Sometimes I just
can't stand you...!

156
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:21,416
Goodbye!

157
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,666
Geez.

158
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:31,250
You could at least walk
me to the bus station!

159
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:32,708
Don't feel like it.

160
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:35,166
This neighborhood has been
dangerous lately, you know?

161
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,750
You don't say.

162
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:40,500
No way...

163
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:42,875
You don't even care what
happens to your own sister?

164
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,750
Jackass, jackass!

165
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:48,166
I hope that serial killer
chops you up into little pieces!

166
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,041
Finally some
peace and quiet.

167
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:11,625
Those eyes...

168
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:12,666
whose are they?

169
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,375
The General?

170
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:21,875
An image link?

171
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,458
Now, where did he come
from out of the blue?

172
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:29,666
A virus...?

173
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:30,875
There's no way I'm
gonna fall for that.

174
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:33,791
Better luck next time.

175
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:34,875
What's with this guy?

176
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:36,500
I won't click your link.

177
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:37,666
"Not a virus."

178
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,125
Huh, is that so...?

179
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:41,125
Don't be so cryptic then.

180
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:42,791
Where are you from?

181
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:45,291
"Shibuya. "Me too.

182
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,791
Strange happenings
lately, huh?

183
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:48,791
"There's more to come."

184
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:51,375
A formula?

185
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:54,666
Wait, what is this...?

186
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,041
Who is this General person,

187
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:57,791
some sort of
doomsday nutcase?

188
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:00,125
What's the deal
with this link?

189
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:01,500
You're saying that
if I click on it

190
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:02,833
things will get interesting.

191
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:05,166
"Give it a try."

192
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:29,083
Oh no, what is this?

193
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:37,041
Nanami smash!

194
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:41,125
Sorry.

195
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:52,041
Excuse me!

196
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:54,666
Hey, throw it over here!

197
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,125
Sure...

198
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:57,375
Here it comes!

199
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,916
Oh.

200
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,375
Uh, one more time.

201
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:06,083
Here it comes!

202
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:10,375
Geez, that girl
was terrible.

203
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:11,833
I've never seen
anyone that bad!

204
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:13,125
She must be
rich or spoiled.

205
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:20,541
Thanks to that General guy,
I can't relax at home...

206
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:23,166
I'll just hang out here for a
little bit in my usual spot.

207
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:36,291
Good times.

208
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:37,291
Huh?

209
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:39,041
That's the same
one Nanami has.

210
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:41,666
Why would you want three?

211
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:44,666
Researching New Gen?

212
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:51,333
And just when everything
was starting to look up.

213
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:09,375
What's that...?

214
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:11,041
I am in Shibuya, right...?

215
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:12,125
Least I think.

216
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:24,083
What's this?

217
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:37,166
That's the image...

218
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,500
From the General's link.

219
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:50,500
Hello...

220
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:52,958
I've been waiting
for you, Taku.

221
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:07,583
Hello...

222
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:10,083
I've been waiting
for you, Taku.

223
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:11,208
What...?

224
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:13,125
How does that
girl know my name?

225
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:21,916
What the hell was that?

226
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,333
What is happening to me?

227
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:32,416
She saw my face...

228
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,666
She looked at me and
called me by my name...

229
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,458
What should I do?

230
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:38,000
Hey, it's okay, Takki.

231
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:39,666
I'm sure it was just
one of your delusions.

232
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,291
But... But that stake?

233
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:45,250
I don't see anything.

234
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:47,000
Huh...?You're kidding.

235
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:48,750
Now no more negative
delusions, mister.

236
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:50,291
Think positive, okay...?

237
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:53,291
Don't I love you most
when you're happy?

238
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:54,666
You're right Seira...

239
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,750
It must've been
a delusion!

240
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:57,875
What was I thinking?

241
00:14:57,958 --> 00:14:59,541
Happy thoughts
from now on!

242
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:09,208
Now I can see the shape
of a cross here...

243
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:12,083
dark gray needles form...

244
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:15,791
the image for me...

245
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:20,291
Washing o'er us
while you're near.

246
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:23,875
Cleansing our sin...

247
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:27,416
Our prayers
are with you...

248
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,166
holy one.

249
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:33,625
Those eyes...

250
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:35,000
whose are they?

251
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:43,750
Who is that?

252
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,041
Someone's watching me?

253
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:57,875
Damn it, why is
she following me?

254
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,333
Maybe it's the demon
girl from yesterday?

255
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:03,583
Has she come
here to kill me?

256
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:13,250
Hey... Hope you're
having a good morning.

257
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:21,583
Did I do something to make
her hold a grudge against me?

258
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:23,041
No, that's impossible...

259
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:25,000
No one pays
attention to me,

260
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:26,416
I might as well
be invisible.

261
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:31,875
I don't know, maybe
I was overreacting

262
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:33,458
with the whole being
followed thing?

263
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:42,250
I was right, she's been stalking
me since this morning...

264
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:43,916
She must be working
with that devil girl!

265
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:00,958
Stop it, no!

266
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:05,125
Was that a delusion?

267
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:10,291
Either way, I better
get outta here.

268
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:18,125
That was so not awesome.

269
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:23,541
Excuse me, but are
you gonna be okay?

270
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,791
Do you need me to take you
to the hospital or something?

271
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:27,958
Who are you...?

272
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:30,500
Why are you following me?

273
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:33,166
Please... Tell me
what you want from me!

274
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:36,958
I, um... well,
you see I wanted to...

275
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:40,291
Well, my name is...
Yua Kusunoki and I just...

276
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:42,083
Well... The truth is...

277
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:43,833
after I saw you
this morning

278
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:46,291
I couldn't get you
out of my mind.

279
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:47,666
I see...

280
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,208
She's trying
to seduce me...

281
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:51,208
I won't fall for it.

282
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:52,791
Uh... Listen...

283
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:54,208
You're bothering me...

284
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:56,166
So... please stop
following me around.

285
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,583
I'm so sorry.

286
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:01,583
Wait, is she being
sincere...?

287
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:03,583
Just... Just please
leave me alone...

288
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:07,583
You sure you don't
need a doctor?

289
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:08,875
Look, I'm fine!

290
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:10,791
At least let me
walk you home...

291
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:13,291
After all, it's my fault you got
hurt in the first place...

292
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:16,083
Let me help,
it's no biggie.

293
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:17,791
Um, what part of
town do you live in?

294
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:20,708
Uh... In Shinsen.

295
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:22,166
Shinsen?

296
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,333
Oh crap...

297
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:25,125
Why did I just
tell her that...?

298
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:26,708
What am I expecting
out of this?

299
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:32,291
I swear, my brother's
so mean to me sometimes!

300
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:34,583
And what pisses me off
even more is his obsession

301
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:36,291
with those stupid
little dolls!

302
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:38,000
So your brother's one
of those guys, huh?

303
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,916
Only interested
in anime chicks?

304
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,833
Ugh, boys like that
are totally weird.

305
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:43,083
The weirdest!

306
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:44,041
But you know what?

307
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:45,375
More women than
you'd expect

308
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,375
actually go for those
types of guys...

309
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:49,000
I have a friend like
that and she thinks,

310
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:50,208
"Oh I can change them,

311
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:51,916
I'm gonna save them
all from themselves!"

312
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,541
Hey! Maybe Takumi
can find a girl

313
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:55,333
to rescue him from
his otaku ways!

314
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:56,583
What...? My brother?

315
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:57,708
Sure, why not?

316
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:03,416
I... I think I can take
it from here, thanks.

317
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,458
Wow, this is it?

318
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:05,833
This is such a
cool place to live.

319
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:07,416
I could get
used to this...

320
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,125
It's awesome.

321
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:11,041
It's got a real
outlaw vibe to it,

322
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:12,875
living life on the
edge and all that.

323
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:14,250
I won't be fooled...

324
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:17,000
I will never let a 3D
girl get the best of me!

325
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:25,083
Feeling any better?

326
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:26,166
Yeah, I guess.

327
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,125
She's so gentle
and considerate...

328
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:30,708
No...!I won't
be tricked...

329
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:32,083
I will not be fooled!

330
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:34,750
Oh! That's Seira
from Blood Tune...

331
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:36,416
I love her.

332
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,958
Wait... Do you
know Blood Tune?

333
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:39,250
Yeah, I watch
it every week,

334
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:41,333
it's my favorite
TV show by far!

335
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:43,000
Oh, wow.

336
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:44,833
So you're a fan
of Seira, too?

337
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:46,666
I think she's awesome,

338
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,750
definitely the coolest
heroine out there.

339
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:51,458
Are... Are you
really an anime nerd?

340
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:53,000
Oh... nothing.

341
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:55,708
Hey, do you mind if I
take a look at these?

342
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:57,166
Um...

343
00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:00,250
I'm really sorry if I'm
being too pushy here...

344
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:02,083
I guess I should
probably go home now.

345
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:03,458
No, go ahead and look.

346
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:04,791
Are you sure...?

347
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:06,583
Oh thank you so much!

348
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:10,291
That's the very first version
of the Seira action figure.

349
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,791
They've released a bunch
of different editions

350
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:13,083
since the game
came out...

351
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:14,791
That one's definitely
my favorite.

352
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:16,041
Wow.

353
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:17,875
Did you see that
shelf right there?

354
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:19,583
Cool, you have so many!

355
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:21,166
That's awesome!

356
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:24,875
Actually, I have every
Seira figurine ever made...

357
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:27,541
I've been waiting for them to
release the newest version...

358
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:30,041
But it's probably gonna
be pretty expensive.

359
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:31,208
You mean the
Awakened version

360
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:33,000
from the big scene
in Episode Twelve?

361
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:35,208
Wow, I'm really
impressed...

362
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:36,708
You sound like
a super fan.

363
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:39,000
Yeah I guess I am...!

364
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:40,333
I can't stop watching
that episode.

365
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:42,666
It gets better every time.

366
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,375
I think the reason
it's so awesome

367
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:46,125
is 'cause the acting
and animation director

368
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:47,583
is the same...

369
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:49,416
He's easily one of the best
directors in the business,

370
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,750
so the high quality
is to be expected.

371
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,833
Wow, you really do know a
lot about this kind of stuff,

372
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:55,375
don't you?

373
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:56,791
You should pay attention
to the writers and directors

374
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:58,333
who work
on those shows.

375
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:02,208
Oh I will now, thanks for
teaching me something new.

376
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:04,000
Hey, uh...

377
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:06,875
I don't mean to
be too forward.

378
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:10,083
But would you
tell me your name?

379
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:12,666
Yeah... I'm Takumi Nishijo.

380
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,583
It's nice to meet
you, Takumi...

381
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:15,541
What year are you?

382
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:17,500
Oh... uh... second.

383
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:19,375
Hey, I'm in third year...

384
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:23,125
I guess that means I'm
older than you are, huh?

385
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:25,166
Oh no... I'm falling for it,

386
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,041
I think she's
getting to me...

387
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:29,625
Is Yua like the serene,
gentle older girl?

388
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:31,416
So Takumi...

389
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,750
I have a small
favor to ask of you.

390
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:35,041
A favor?

391
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:38,000
I want you...

392
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:40,125
I've wanted you
for a long time...

393
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:42,833
I've always had my
eye on you, Takumi...

394
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:46,208
What's the matter? Don't you
wanna get to know me better?

395
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:48,125
Why is she wearing
Seira's bikini?

396
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,750
Ow...

397
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:53,708
I'm sorry,
I'm such a klutz.

398
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:55,916
I hope I didn't break
any of your CDs.

399
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,125
I'll clean it
up right away.

400
00:21:58,083 --> 00:21:59,583
Uh. That's okay.

401
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:08,416
Oh no, it's nothing,
don't pay attention to me.

402
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,791
Please... try not to
touch the figurines, okay?

403
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:11,833
Uh, okay...

404
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:12,833
But...

405
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:15,625
That wasn't it-

406
00:22:15,708 --> 00:22:17,291
I... don't mean
to alarm you,

407
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:19,208
but it's a fan
fiction mag...

408
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:21,583
There's some pretty
racy stuff in here...

409
00:22:21,666 --> 00:22:24,208
I'm sorry, I wasn't expecting
to see something like that.

410
00:22:25,958 --> 00:22:26,916
Don't look
through my things.

411
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I'm sorry!

412
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,750
So like I was
saying before...

413
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:34,041
I have a favor to ask.

414
00:22:34,125 --> 00:22:35,541
I really wanna go
to an anime store.

415
00:22:35,625 --> 00:22:37,375
Would you please
come with me?

416
00:22:37,458 --> 00:22:39,208
Huh?

417
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:41,333
As much as I love it,
I've never been before,

418
00:22:41,416 --> 00:22:44,291
but I've always wanted to
see what one was like...

419
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:46,291
Uh, this is kind of a
bold move on my part

420
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:47,583
since I barely know you...

421
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:48,958
I'm sorry.

422
00:22:49,041 --> 00:22:50,500
This has got
to be a trap...

423
00:22:50,583 --> 00:22:52,166
Things like this
don't happen!

424
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:53,750
This is like some
farfetched plot

425
00:22:53,833 --> 00:22:56,208
out of an erotic
fantasy game.

426
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:58,083
Well... Let's forget about it,

427
00:22:58,166 --> 00:23:00,208
I don't want to put you
on the spot or anything...

428
00:23:00,291 --> 00:23:01,541
It was good enough

429
00:23:01,625 --> 00:23:03,083
just to be able to have
a nice long chat with you

430
00:23:03,166 --> 00:23:05,125
This is an act,
I have to reject her.

431
00:23:05,208 --> 00:23:07,000
I've gotta tell
her like a man!

432
00:23:10,916 --> 00:23:11,750
You gotta be kidding!

433
00:23:11,833 --> 00:23:13,083
She's crying?!

434
00:23:13,166 --> 00:23:14,166
Now I'm just lost,

435
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:15,625
what the hell
is she up to?

436
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,791
Please, there's no
need to force it...

437
00:23:20,875 --> 00:23:22,250
Anyway it's not
really fair for me

438
00:23:22,333 --> 00:23:24,750
to drag you along for
my own selfish reasons.

439
00:23:24,833 --> 00:23:26,666
I'll go.

440
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:28,041
Wait, are you serious?

441
00:23:30,125 --> 00:23:31,500
Oh...

442
00:23:31,583 --> 00:23:32,666
This is wonderful...!

443
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:35,333
Thank you!

444
00:23:35,416 --> 00:23:37,416
That look on your
face won't fool me!

445
00:23:42,708 --> 00:23:45,416
I'm so sorry if I overstayed
my welcome tonight...

446
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,750
You really should
go see a doctor

447
00:23:46,833 --> 00:23:48,583
if you're not feeling
better tomorrow...

448
00:23:48,666 --> 00:23:49,875
Bye-bye.

449
00:23:57,708 --> 00:23:59,041
Don't worry, Seira,

450
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:01,666
you'll always be
my number one girl.

451
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:04,166
I'll be waiting for your
Awakened version to come out!

452
00:24:07,625 --> 00:24:09,166
And in other news...

453
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:11,875
Another dead body was discovered
in an alley in Shibuya

454
00:24:11,958 --> 00:24:13,458
late yesterday evening...

455
00:24:13,541 --> 00:24:14,791
A man was left to die

456
00:24:14,875 --> 00:24:17,166
after being pinned to a
wall with metal stakes.

457
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:19,083
This is the latest in a
series of brutal murders

458
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:20,750
commonly known as
the New Gen crimes.

459
00:24:20,833 --> 00:24:22,041
The police department

460
00:24:22,125 --> 00:24:24,000
is launching a
full-scale investigation

461
00:24:24,083 --> 00:24:26,458
in order to put a stop to
this horrific chain of events.

462
00:24:29,583 --> 00:24:30,791
Good morning!

463
00:24:33,666 --> 00:24:35,083
Morning.

464
00:24:35,166 --> 00:24:36,458
Morning!

465
00:24:48,375 --> 00:24:50,208
No. There's no way.

466
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:55,166
It's really her.

467
00:25:02,666 --> 00:25:04,041
Hey there... Taku!

468
00:25:07,375 --> 00:25:13,083
[Music]

469
00:26:43,666 --> 00:26:45,166
Those eyes...

470
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:46,208
whose are they?
