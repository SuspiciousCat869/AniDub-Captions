[Music]

2
00:01:38,708 --> 00:01:40,791
I'm Takumi Nishijo...

3
00:01:40,875 --> 00:01:44,625
Rimi finally confided
the truth to me.

4
00:01:44,708 --> 00:01:46,333
I'm not supposed to exist,

5
00:01:46,416 --> 00:01:49,666
I'm a being created by the
delusions of a gigalomaniac,

6
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:52,541
the real Takumi Nishijo.

7
00:01:52,625 --> 00:01:54,041
Rimi...

8
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:55,875
She knows a lot
of things I don't.

9
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,708
Something else is happening
in a place I can't see.

10
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:05,208
I hope Nanami's okay
after being kidnapped?

11
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,458
In the end...

12
00:02:08,541 --> 00:02:11,083
I'm nothing but a
delusive existence...

13
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:13,208
So I decided not
to care anymore.

14
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,500
But then...

15
00:02:16,583 --> 00:02:18,083
I had company...

16
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:20,291
The General appeared
before me again.

17
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:32,791
Tell me...

18
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:34,541
Tell me who you are.

19
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:36,333
I am you, Takumi.

20
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,166
You're the one
who created me...

21
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,916
I'm your delusion,
aren't I...?

22
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,041
You've been watching
me this whole time...

23
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:44,250
From the very start,
haven't you?

24
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,375
If this continues,
the world will end...

25
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:49,916
The mind of
everyone on earth

26
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,666
will be controlled
by Noah II.

27
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,041
But I don't care...

28
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:55,000
None of this has
anything to do with me...

29
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:56,166
I'm begging you...

30
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,666
Please erase me...

31
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,333
I don't wanna deal with
this, just kill me!

32
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:02,416
This whole thing
is my fault...

33
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:06,041
Because I envisioned
IR2 in my delusion...

34
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:07,916
I created you because
my body's weak

35
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,250
and I lost my ability
to move freely...

36
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:12,791
You're here to do all
the things I can't.

37
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:14,125
This isn't my problem...

38
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:15,416
It's not my fight!

39
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,791
Rimi...

40
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:19,166
She was captured trying
to rescue your sister.

41
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:21,916
Don't you see...?

42
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,666
Rimi has been trying
to save my life.

43
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,208
It's all for me.

44
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,375
Look at the sky...

45
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:31,833
It's so blue...

46
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:33,125
Why is that?

47
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:35,000
It makes me want to cry.

48
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:36,750
Because you wished for it.

49
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:39,166
But I didn't wish for it.

50
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,333
Maybe it was me...

51
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:44,291
It's amazing this is
your mental landscape...

52
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:46,625
But it's also mine
at the same time.

53
00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:48,041
What does that mean?

54
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:49,708
Are you another "me"?

55
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:50,708
No.

56
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:52,791
Well then who are you...?

57
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:55,375
There's never been anything
but darkness...

58
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:57,000
But then you came...

59
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:58,666
And the darkness
vanished...

60
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,708
And then the
sky appeared...

61
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:02,666
The big blue sky.

62
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,166
Our delusions matched
up and synchronized.

63
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,500
Oh.

64
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:11,000
Before now, I'd never seen
anything as beautiful as this...

65
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:13,083
My world was
always black...

66
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:15,291
An empty dark void.

67
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:18,125
What about the real sky?

68
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:20,041
Don't you think you'd
like to see it some day?

69
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:24,125
Where is that sky...?

70
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:25,875
Do you know?

71
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:28,916
As long as you wish
for it, it's anywhere.

72
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,666
But how do I wish for it?

73
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,083
Light is nothing
more than waves...

74
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:35,833
Electromagnetic waves...

75
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:37,541
Humans perceive
these oscillations

76
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:39,166
as different colors...

77
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,875
First pick out a color...

78
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:42,750
then send it to
your dead spot...

79
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:44,541
If you can...

80
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:47,666
you'll be able to create the
color of the world you desire.

81
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:59,125
Yes?

82
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:01,666
I came back
here to see you.

83
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,875
Did you get to see
the real sky yet?

84
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:06,791
Rimi...

85
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:08,791
Why did she get
so close to me?

86
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,583
She was monitoring
your actions...

87
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:12,250
Watching over you.

88
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:13,875
She kept close
tabs on anyone

89
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:15,583
who tried to approach you...

90
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:18,416
Everything she did was to
prevent your awakening.

91
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,000
Because once that happens,

92
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:23,125
my life on this
earth will be over.

93
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:25,583
I didn't want Rimi
to get involved...

94
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:27,708
but she sure
is a nosy girl.

95
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:28,666
Who's responsible...?

96
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,458
Who kidnapped the girls?

97
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:34,166
The man in charge
of Project Noah...

98
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,208
The one behind it all...

99
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:38,250
Genichi Norose.

100
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:39,625
Wait, I know him...

101
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:41,500
Yeah, from Nozomi.

102
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:45,041
And this isn't the first
time he's held Rimi captive.

103
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:46,875
Of course that
didn't stop her.

104
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:50,166
Please don't...

105
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,666
There's no need for
you to go this far.

106
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:53,916
There is...

107
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,708
After all you've done,
let me help...

108
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:57,208
Also...

109
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:59,958
I don't want Taku
mixed up in this thing.

110
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:01,375
He's weak...

111
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:04,750
He's not confident,
he's hopelessly pitiful...

112
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:06,000
He's the type of guy

113
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:07,916
that normal girls
wouldn't think twice about

114
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,875
or even give the
time of day...

115
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:11,208
Even so...

116
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:13,208
In my heart I
had feelings...

117
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:14,583
feelings of joy...

118
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:17,625
like all I wanted was to
spend more time with him.

119
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:20,625
Well... I'm sure
he enjoyed it too.

120
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:23,291
I sure hope so.

121
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:25,291
Well then...
I've got to get going.

122
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:26,708
Rimi, don't!

123
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:30,625
I'm telling you,
I'll be fine...

124
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:32,083
You don't need to
worry about a thing...

125
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:33,333
I'll settle this,

126
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:35,875
I'm going to take care
of everything, Takumi...

127
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:36,958
Bye.

128
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,166
Rimi really is
nosy, isn't she?

129
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,791
How about I stay
with you then?

130
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:53,208
I shut myself in home base

131
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:56,166
and went out of my way
not to talk to anybody...

132
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,916
It's like the minute I
was born into this world

133
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,583
I was already dead...

134
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:01,166
But Rimi...

135
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,041
She was always there,
right by my side.

136
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:05,416
She comforted my mind

137
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,708
when I trembled,
overcome with fear...

138
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:09,208
She supported me...

139
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:10,791
She encouraged me...

140
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:12,958
She was kind and taught
me human warmth

141
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:14,791
even though I'm
just a delusion...

142
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:17,166
She could've easily
let me die...

143
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,750
But she protected me.

144
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:23,708
I remember every
detail so clearly...

145
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:26,041
All of Rimi's
little gestures.

146
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:27,541
Her soft breath...

147
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:29,208
The sparkle of her eyes...

148
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:30,958
Her sweet voice...

149
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:32,750
And her tender warmth.

150
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:36,458
I see...

151
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:38,041
I've always been
in love with her.

152
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:44,708
Even if everything
else was a delusion...

153
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:46,375
If it was all fake...

154
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:49,166
My feelings for her and
the love that I felt...

155
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,333
It was real.

156
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:54,791
It's time you
saved the world.

157
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:57,458
You don't understand,
I'm not a hero.

158
00:07:57,541 --> 00:08:00,916
I am truly sorry for pushing
this onto you so unfairly...

159
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,583
But you doing this
is our only option!

160
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:06,666
Don't you know it's stupid
to apologize to yourself?

161
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:09,416
When people have a chance
to realize their mistakes,

162
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,458
they can do
things over...

163
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:13,541
So... because you
and I are one...

164
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:16,125
I hate you for what
you've done to me.

165
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:18,875
That's funny,
because I envy you.

166
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:22,291
I'm not doing this to be
your second chance, okay?

167
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:24,750
The only reason I'm
doing this is for me.

168
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:26,250
To discover my purpose!

169
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:28,958
I'll figure out why I'm
here on my own terms!

170
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:32,541
What is that?

171
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,166
I finally found my light...

172
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,333
my di-sword.

173
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:47,625
I'm going to end
this thing...

174
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:49,416
Once and for all.

175
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,791
Go, Taku.

176
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:55,000
Find the porters who
are causing this riot

177
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:57,250
and destroy the machines
they're carrying...

178
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:59,750
Without their equipment,
the people will relax...

179
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:01,708
Their biorhythms
will settle down.

180
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,166
Porters?

181
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,958
They serve as terminal
units for Noah II...

182
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:08,625
You've already
seen hints of them.

183
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:10,000
Wait, I've seen them?

184
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:13,958
My company is calling
them porters...

185
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:15,541
To put it another way,

186
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:18,208
you might think of them
as a mind control team.

187
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:22,000
I see...

188
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:23,166
Have I been reading
his thoughts

189
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,916
all along without knowing it?

190
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,416
Read the porters' minds...

191
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,583
You must hurry.

192
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:31,500
Divine light save us...

193
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:33,208
Divine light save us.

194
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:34,875
Divine light save us?

195
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:36,833
Divine light save us...

196
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:38,500
Divine light save us...

197
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:40,333
Divine light save us...

198
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:41,625
Divine light save us...

199
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:42,750
Where are they?

200
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:47,416
He's right there!

201
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,041
What...? Oh no!

202
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:58,666
Take this!

203
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:04,625
The divine light save us.

204
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:06,083
There's one more...

205
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:07,166
But where?

206
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:14,750
Wait, she's from
the hospital.

207
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:16,041
Show these people.

208
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:18,583
Expose her for the
monster she is.

209
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:20,250
What do you mean,
what has she done?

210
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:31,125
No, Hazuki ...

211
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:32,750
Please you can
still let me go...

212
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:34,000
Don't do this.

213
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:38,958
The divine light
will save you.

214
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:42,916
Salvation's here.

215
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,375
Hazuki...

216
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:46,000
What are you going to do?

217
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:49,250
No please don't do this...

218
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:51,000
Please don't...

219
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:05,875
These are your
memories, not mine.

220
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,541
You're behind everything,

221
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:10,041
you're the New Gen criminal!

222
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,541
That's not all.

223
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,791
Tell me why...

224
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:20,875
Why'd you brutally murder
all those people...?

225
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:22,458
Tell me, Grim.

226
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:24,750
Hello, Knight Heart.

227
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:27,000
Everything I did was
for one purpose,

228
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:29,208
to awaken your
gigalomaniac powers.

229
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:30,500
What did you just say?

230
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,000
Don't you see,
Knight Heart...?

231
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:36,916
These were direct orders from
the great founder of our sect.

232
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,083
Your founder?

233
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,833
Wait, that stake, it's...

234
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,958
May the divine light
save you, my friend.

235
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:03,666
The Third Melt...!

236
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,125
It's already happening.

237
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:28,125
According to the
Meteorological Agency,

238
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:30,500
the earthquake that struck
Shibuya yesterday

239
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,708
was comparable in size to the
Great Kanto Earthquake...

240
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:36,041
a 7.8 in magnitude.

241
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:39,333
So far only 233 deaths
have been reported,

242
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:41,125
but according to authorities

243
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:44,625
the final death toll may
ultimately surpass 30,000.

244
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:47,166
Ayase...

245
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,458
Let's hurry, we should
get somewhere safe.

246
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:50,583
No way...

247
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:52,875
King Gladiale has
already awoken...

248
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:54,500
We have to meet up with
the other Black Knights

249
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:56,208
as soon as possible.

250
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:57,541
Yeah, but...

251
00:12:57,625 --> 00:12:58,500
Who's that?

252
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,541
Huh? Hey wait, that's Takumi's
younger sister Nanami.

253
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:06,666
Takumi's what?

254
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:08,875
Hey, Yua...

255
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:11,375
Rimi's in trouble, we
have to do something!

256
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,750
Rimi is another one of
the seven Black Knights.

257
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:15,791
What...? She is...? Really?

258
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:19,791
Please just listen...

259
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:21,833
I don't want you getting
any closer to him...

260
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:24,000
I don't want
Taku to awaken!

261
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:25,916
Have you forgotten
you're one too...?

262
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,958
All the Knights
must join together.

263
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:30,416
I can manage this situation
on my own, thank you.

264
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:36,666
Your feelings are very
inspiring, truly they are...

265
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:37,875
But you must understand,

266
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:39,791
this is not what the
Great Will desires...

267
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:42,583
It's not what I
desire either.

268
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:46,375
I cannot let you shoulder
everything by yourself.

269
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,041
She's one of us.

270
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:49,708
So where is Rimi right now?

271
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:15,125
Hey are you okay...?

272
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:16,291
Hang in there.

273
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:17,666
Thank you.

274
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,750
Everyone who can
move, lend a hand!

275
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:21,125
Right!

276
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:23,500
This is the power
of Noah II...?

277
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:25,000
General

278
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:26,041
General!

279
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:31,041
You have got to get
it together, General.

280
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:35,416
It is the Great Will

281
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,500
Leading us to pleasure

282
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,250
I know that voice.

283
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:44,791
Will you come?

284
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:46,458
Follow

285
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:49,791
And love will flow.

286
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:51,500
Takumi.

287
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:53,041
Ayase!

288
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:58,750
There are two more here...

289
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:00,250
Your sister's one.

290
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:01,458
Nanami...?

291
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:02,458
All right.

292
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:06,666
Your di-sword...! Finally!

293
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:11,791
This rubble is nothing...

294
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:13,875
There's a lot of it,
but each piece is small...

295
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:15,041
It's not heavy...

296
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:16,625
I can save all
three of them!

297
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:27,000
Nanami!

298
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:33,625
Taku.

299
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:34,875
Thank goodness.

300
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:36,916
Nanami.

301
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:37,916
You came.

302
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,125
You're okay.

303
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:41,208
You're such a good
brother, Taku...

304
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:42,291
Thank you.

305
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:45,208
I don't know how
to tell you this,

306
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:47,416
but I'm not actually
your real brother.

307
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,458
What?

308
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:53,708
How are ya, Taku? !

309
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:56,041
Hey, you've been skipping
meals again, mister...!

310
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:57,666
How many times do
I have to tell you?

311
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,041
You have to eat!

312
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,625
Sorry, Nanami.

313
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:02,708
What's the
matter with you?

314
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:05,458
Listen... Something happened,
and I have to hide...

315
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:07,166
so you can't...
come here anymore,

316
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,791
do you understand?

317
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:10,833
No I don't,
what do you mean?

318
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:12,000
Go, Nanami.

319
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:23,125
I forgot...

320
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:25,416
How could that happen?

321
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,250
I can't take this...

322
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:30,083
I know all I ever did was
nag you about stuff...

323
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:31,791
But I never once
wanted to forget...

324
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:32,958
I'm sorry...

325
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:34,458
Please believe me, I swear,

326
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:36,375
I never wanted to
forget you, Takumi

327
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:43,875
Go on...

328
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:46,583
He and I are one
and the same...

329
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:47,708
Follow him...

330
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:49,458
He's your brother now.

331
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:50,875
Taku?

332
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,416
Hey wait!

333
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:57,875
Listen...

334
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:00,625
Maybe you and I aren't
really related after all...

335
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:02,041
And I know I
always give you crap

336
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:03,500
'cause you're
an anime nerd...

337
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:04,958
But still...

338
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:06,916
No matter what happens,
you're my brother!

339
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:11,250
Thank you so much, Nanami.

340
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:13,291
Taku.

341
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:17,541
Well, well, it looks like
you've finally awakened.

342
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:21,041
But now will you be able to make
it all the way here to me...?

343
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:22,708
The hard part
is yet to come.

344
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,208
Help me.

345
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:31,291
Rimi's in big trouble,
she needs our help.

346
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:32,416
I know...

347
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,125
And I'm going to
rescue her right now...

348
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:37,666
Take good care of him.

349
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,708
I, uh... Takumi.

350
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:41,500
Huh?

351
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:44,291
I know that I've said a lot of
really terrible things to you...

352
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:45,750
I'm so sorry.

353
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:49,541
You remember the Seira
figurines at my place...?

354
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:50,666
I want you to have them.

355
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:51,625
They're yours.

356
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:56,083
You... are going to
defeat King Gladiale?

357
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:58,125
If you mean Noah II,
then yeah...

358
00:17:58,208 --> 00:17:59,875
That's the plan.

359
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:01,166
Then I'm coming with you.

360
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,500
And me, too!

361
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,083
What's this?

362
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:17,125
-Takumi.
-Taku.

363
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:24,208
Stand back... You
leave this one to me!

364
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:26,791
If this is enough to
repent for my sins!

365
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:28,583
Quick! Get Gladiale!

366
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:29,916
On my way!

367
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:40,916
I can't walk any more.

368
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,708
Hey what's wrong?

369
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:45,125
At last, I finally found you.

370
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:51,916
For the past six months

371
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I've been dreaming
of this day...

372
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:56,458
I've wondered how I would
settle things with you.

373
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:57,666
Thank you.

374
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,250
Why would you thank me?

375
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:01,541
Because however you
settle things...

376
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:04,333
it will be the ultimate
atonement for all my sins...

377
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:06,041
I deserve this.

378
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:08,000
In that case,
let's get right to it.

379
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:14,333
Just one question...

380
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:16,666
How could you do something
so terrible to them?

381
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,500
I mean they were
your own family.

382
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:21,583
Trying to explain away
what happened makes no sense...

383
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:23,125
And besides, nothing
I can say to you

384
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:24,958
will change
what I did, Sena.

385
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:28,375
Your way of running
away again, huh?

386
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:29,625
Coward...

387
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:30,625
That's all you are.

388
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:35,916
You still expect something.

389
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:40,166
Everything's an electronic
device, including people...

390
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:43,625
You're the one who said
that, Sena, not me.

391
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:44,875
Sena... Stay strong,

392
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:47,250
they're attacking your mind.

393
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:49,333
The things you feel
about me are nothing...

394
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:51,166
Just another
electronic signal.

395
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:55,125
Sena!

396
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:57,291
Sena!

397
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:07,416
Uh-oh, looks like
I missed that one...

398
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,333
But still if you
consider the distance,

399
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,750
it's actually not that
terrible of a shot.

400
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:13,583
Why would he protect me...?

401
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:14,708
After all this.

402
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:17,916
These words,
they're meaningless...

403
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:20,875
But you're too
honest, Sena...

404
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:23,166
And that's why
I adore you...

405
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,666
I love you the way you are...

406
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,541
Don't say that.

407
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:29,916
Oh well, it doesn't really
matter, does it...?

408
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,083
After all, I suppose
two dead Hatanos

409
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:33,791
are better than one,
am I right?

410
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:35,333
Don't stand in my way!

411
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:40,541
My sister...

412
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:41,583
This can't be...

413
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:47,750
When I saw my mother and
sister in that state,

414
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:49,875
I didn't just feel sadness...

415
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,583
Even more than the
shock and horror

416
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:52,916
of seeing her hurt so much,

417
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,875
I felt sick
to my stomach...

418
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:57,041
I've always felt
guilty about that...

419
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:58,375
And I think by
hating my father

420
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:01,750
I avoided ever having
to deal with the pain.

421
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:03,208
I just...

422
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:04,166
I...

423
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:11,208
Who are you?

424
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:13,625
Are you a person...?

425
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:14,833
Who are you, girl?

426
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:17,625
Who am I...?

427
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:19,541
Are you a person?

428
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:20,875
Who are you?

429
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:22,875
Who are you?

430
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:24,000
You're Kozzy, that's who!

431
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:29,375
That's right, I'm Kozzy...

432
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:30,500
I am Kozzy!

433
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:36,416
Takumi!

434
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,250
Thank goodness,
you're okay...

435
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:40,666
I heard your cries
for help in my mind...

436
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:43,291
I wasn't sure I was gonna be
able to make it here in time.

437
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:45,708
Well, this is a
lucky break, huh?

438
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:47,250
Mamoru Suwa...

439
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:49,666
I can see it, I know
what this man has done.

440
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:54,791
Mister Nishijo...

441
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:55,916
The higher ups
have ordered me

442
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,708
to capture you on
sight, my friend.

443
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:00,916
You murdered him...

444
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,166
You shot your own
partner, didn't you?

445
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:04,875
If I were you I'd
watch my mouth

446
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:06,333
and learn some
manners, kid...

447
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:08,416
You're talking to
a police officer.

448
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,083
I'll say whatever
I want...

449
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:12,583
There's no reason
to be polite to you.

450
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:15,083
You think it's all right to
talk down to me like that...?

451
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:16,083
You pansy!

452
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:19,083
Look out!

453
00:22:19,166 --> 00:22:20,125
That stake, it's...

454
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:23,708
How about I recreate
the staking for you,

455
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:25,250
does that sound like fun?

456
00:22:31,708 --> 00:22:33,250
See I'm just a
regular human being...

457
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:34,416
but thanks to Noah II,

458
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,250
I've gained power
as great as yours.

459
00:22:36,333 --> 00:22:38,708
It's the Noah II terminal
inside his backpack.

460
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:40,625
If I could just get to it.

461
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:42,875
As long as I have
this mechanism,

462
00:22:42,958 --> 00:22:45,958
Noah II's power will be
with me wherever I go.

463
00:22:46,041 --> 00:22:48,250
As long as he has
that mechanism,

464
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:51,958
Noah II's power will be
with him wherever he goes.

465
00:22:52,041 --> 00:22:54,958
I can become an
artificial gigalomaniac.

466
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:57,583
He'll be able to be an
artificial gigalomaniac.

467
00:23:00,041 --> 00:23:01,375
You're like an
insect specimen

468
00:23:01,458 --> 00:23:03,583
held in place with a pin.

469
00:23:03,666 --> 00:23:05,250
But this next
one will end you.

470
00:23:06,583 --> 00:23:07,875
It'll kill me!

471
00:23:09,791 --> 00:23:11,666
There's no divine
light waiting for you

472
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,041
at the end of the tunnel!

473
00:23:15,291 --> 00:23:16,833
The one who'll be
killed by this is...

474
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:22,125
This isn't the
end of my story...

475
00:23:22,208 --> 00:23:23,750
It's just the start.

476
00:23:23,833 --> 00:23:24,708
But wait...

477
00:23:24,791 --> 00:23:26,500
How...? What's this?

478
00:23:28,791 --> 00:23:30,500
I linked our delusions...

479
00:23:30,583 --> 00:23:32,791
You made the rules, then I
flipped them on their head.

480
00:23:32,875 --> 00:23:34,416
You distorted my delusion.

481
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,000
How in the hell
did you do that?

482
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:38,041
-I switched them up.
-You switched them up.

483
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,041
And I don't need
any salvation!

484
00:23:47,833 --> 00:23:49,916
Kozzy, are you okay?

485
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,666
Yeah but what just
happened here?

486
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:53,958
I don't understand?!

487
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:56,541
Kozzy... Hey you're
talking out loud!

488
00:23:56,625 --> 00:23:57,583
Goodness...

489
00:23:57,666 --> 00:23:59,583
Wow, I am, no kidding...!

490
00:23:59,666 --> 00:24:02,291
Hey, Sena, listen to this,
I can talk again...

491
00:24:05,916 --> 00:24:07,083
Damn it...

492
00:24:07,166 --> 00:24:09,541
Do you think you made
up for your sins?

493
00:24:09,625 --> 00:24:10,958
Just 'cause you
protected me?

494
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
No way.

495
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,750
I don't care...

496
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:19,500
I'll never forgive you.

497
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:20,625
Poor thing...

498
00:24:20,708 --> 00:24:22,458
She can't stop
the tears...

499
00:24:22,541 --> 00:24:25,666
I guess all she really wanted
was to be with her father.

500
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:27,333
Why'd you have to go?

501
00:24:27,416 --> 00:24:29,541
You could've tried to live
and repent for your sins...

502
00:24:29,625 --> 00:24:32,750
Why'd you leave me here alone
to deal with this by myself...?

503
00:24:32,833 --> 00:24:34,250
Damn it... Come back.

504
00:24:35,541 --> 00:24:36,583
Sena.

505
00:24:37,666 --> 00:24:39,208
Please, Takumi...

506
00:24:39,291 --> 00:24:40,583
Do it...

507
00:24:40,666 --> 00:24:42,416
You must destroy Noah II.

508
00:24:47,583 --> 00:24:48,541
I will...

509
00:24:48,625 --> 00:24:50,250
But this is my burden.

510
00:24:50,333 --> 00:24:52,125
I have to do it
for my own reasons.

511
00:24:53,958 --> 00:24:55,166
Takumi.

512
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,750
Wait for me, Rimi...

513
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:03,875
Don't lose hope,
I'm coming for you.

514
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:12,958
[Music]

515
00:26:43,666 --> 00:26:44,791
Those eyes...

516
00:26:44,875 --> 00:26:46,000
...whose are they?
