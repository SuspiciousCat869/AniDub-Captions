[Music]

2
00:01:38,375 --> 00:01:40,166
I'm Takumi Nishijo...

3
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:42,375
"I'll be saved
if I find it."...

4
00:01:42,458 --> 00:01:43,875
Ever since Ayase told me

5
00:01:43,958 --> 00:01:46,208
that I've been searching
for my di-sword...

6
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:47,875
I did a little
research online

7
00:01:47,958 --> 00:01:49,583
and found a store
that sold them

8
00:01:49,666 --> 00:01:51,583
so I went ahead
and bought one.

9
00:01:51,666 --> 00:01:54,958
The problem is, I don't
know if it's the real thing.

10
00:01:55,041 --> 00:01:56,166
Then I had a delusion

11
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:59,000
where I was the only
person in Shibuya...

12
00:01:59,083 --> 00:02:01,458
I was approached by an old
man in a wheel chair...

13
00:02:01,541 --> 00:02:04,666
He told me that it was
time for me to awaken...

14
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,833
When I asked who he was
he said he's the General.

15
00:02:07,916 --> 00:02:09,250
Everything
happened so fast,

16
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:11,333
I didn't know what
was going on...

17
00:02:11,416 --> 00:02:12,916
If Rimi hadn't rescued me,

18
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,208
who knows what
would've happened?

19
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:17,458
But I don't know if
I can trust her...

20
00:02:17,541 --> 00:02:19,416
Does she really
want to help me?

21
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:28,291
Look at the sky...

22
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:29,583
It's so blue...

23
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:31,250
Why is that?

24
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:33,166
Because you wished for it.

25
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,541
But I didn't wish for it.

26
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:37,000
Well maybe it was me...

27
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:39,708
It's amazing that this is
your mental landscape...

28
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:42,291
But it's also mine
at the same time.

29
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:44,833
But, where is
that exactly?

30
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:49,458
It's anywhere you
wish it to be.

31
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:52,458
Is it okay...? To wish?

32
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:54,583
Wake up, sleepy head!

33
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:56,041
Come on now... Wake up!

34
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:00,625
Hey, how long are you gonna
stay asleep, you silly boy?

35
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:03,000
Fine!

36
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:04,583
If you don't get up
right this minute,

37
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:07,583
I swear, I'll blast you with
my Samurai Pulverizer!

38
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,958
Good morning, Seira babe!

39
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:13,208
Oh, Takki baby...!

40
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:14,458
You'd better
get changed

41
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:16,083
or you're gonna be late
to school, mister!

42
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:17,875
Yeah.

43
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:19,666
I can't believe I
dreamed about Rimi.

44
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,958
But now what am
I supposed to do?

45
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:27,541
I wonder if the same
person is behind it.

46
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:30,208
Crazy how it matches
the band's lyrics.

47
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:31,500
Check this out.

48
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:33,083
I got one of those cool
"Whose eyes are those"

49
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:34,625
t-shirts yesterday.

50
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:36,458
You know... They say the
criminal's a woman.

51
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:38,041
If she's gonna keep
killing people,

52
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:40,041
I wish she'd go after the
creepy guys and weirdoes,

53
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:41,041
you know what I mean?

54
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:45,875
Man, no prize.

55
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Oh. I know her...

56
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:07,250
Isn't she the girl
who transferred

57
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:09,208
into my class
last week?

58
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:10,583
But what was her name?

59
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,166
Taku, listen to this...

60
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,583
Yesterday...

61
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:27,625
I saw two sketchy guys go
into the principal's office.

62
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:29,708
So Rimi and I decided
to eavesdrop on them

63
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:32,833
and we found out something
really interesting.

64
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:35,083
Both of those guys
were detectives.

65
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:36,208
What?

66
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:37,583
They were asking
all these questions.

67
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:39,291
I bet it had to
do with New Gen...

68
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:40,666
Maybe... Or they already
know who did it.

69
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,041
Detectives?

70
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:46,625
Well... We would've
learned more

71
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:49,708
but the principal caught
us eavesdropping.

72
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,833
Only reason they
found us is 'cause

73
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,000
you couldn't shut
your fat mouth!

74
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,416
Sorry, I was nervous...!

75
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,583
It's the first time
I've ever seen

76
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:56,125
real live detectives
in person,

77
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:58,750
so cut me a little
slack, would ya? !

78
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:01,916
Oh yeah, Taku,
did you see Kozue?

79
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,041
You know, the girl
who transferred in?

80
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:05,416
Kozue Orihara.

81
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,791
That's it!

82
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:08,083
Kozue...

83
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:10,791
Why couldn't I
remember her name?

84
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,666
Yeah, I saw her
on the stairs.

85
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,083
She fell.

86
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:19,125
Dude, I've got it bad!

87
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:22,041
Don't you think she
is freakin' adorable?

88
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:23,500
I know. right?

89
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,416
I fell for her the
moment I saw her...

90
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,500
It's weird, I want
to protect her.

91
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:28,875
Hey. Here she comes now.

92
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:31,708
Something's not right.

93
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:33,125
She looks like
she's in pain.

94
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:34,125
Yeah, she does.

95
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,041
I wonder what
happened to her?

96
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:36,458
Kozue, are you
all right...?

97
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:37,875
What's wrong?

98
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:39,958
Hey... Taku.

99
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,500
I was very concerned when
you left the other day.

100
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:45,916
I was really worried about
you and I kept wondering

101
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,083
whether you made it
home safely or not.

102
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:51,208
I am so glad you're okay.

103
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:53,875
Now, promise me that you
will never do that again.

104
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:57,833
Kozue.

105
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:06,750
I don't get it, does she
want to give this to me?

106
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:10,666
Don't cry, Kozue,
he's not upset...

107
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:13,666
Taku just doesn't like to
make eye contact, that's all...

108
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:16,041
So there's no reason for you
to be nervous around him...

109
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,541
I guess you could
call him shy,

110
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:18,916
so don't you fret,

111
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,583
there's nothing to
worry about, okay?

112
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:21,958
Nothing at all!

113
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:28,583
Why wasn't I able to say
anything to Rimi...?

114
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:30,458
I should go to the
internet café.

115
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:33,333
That's-A

116
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:35,083
di-sword...!

117
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:37,083
I know that one, it
belongs to that Sena girl.

118
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,750
Where do they sell a
di-sword like that?

119
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:54,916
I am so hungry right now,
I can barely even stand up.

120
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,708
Oh I want a fish burger...

121
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:01,166
I want it!

122
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,916
Aw man, how embarrassing...!

123
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,791
It's all right
everyone, I'm okay!

124
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:15,750
Damn it... Why did I come to
such a crowded place...?

125
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:18,333
And I lost Sena, too.

126
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:20,708
It's not like I was gonna
talk to her anyways...

127
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:22,208
I should go.

128
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,833
No way!

129
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:53,125
This is a trap!

130
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,041
No!

131
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:58,416
Come in.

132
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,041
I have to get the
hell outta here!

133
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:07,750
No, I'm trapped inside!

134
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:09,708
How much longer are you
planning on standing there?

135
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:18,083
-Where is the error?
-Huh?

136
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:19,333
You've been following me,

137
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:22,083
I assumed that's the reason.

138
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:23,750
You can see my
sword, right...?

139
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:26,416
That's quite a
remarkable trick.

140
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,041
Do you think this is
a perfect world...?

141
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:31,666
Impossible. Errors
definitely exist here...

142
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,416
Don't you know the truth?

143
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,958
Human beings are
electronic devices.

144
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,416
It's not what
you are seeing...

145
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,333
It's what you're
being shown.

146
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:43,333
Every person
receives information

147
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:44,833
from outside themselves

148
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:46,875
using a combination
of their five senses,

149
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:48,875
but about eighty percent
of all that information

150
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:51,208
comes directly from
the sense of sight.

151
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:54,083
The images we pick up become
pulse signals or electricity

152
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,750
and are sent to the brain
through the optical nerve.

153
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:59,416
I don't suppose you've
ever heard of VR...?

154
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,458
Visual rebuilding...?

155
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,125
Individuals who
have been blind

156
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:05,958
since birth can be made
capable of seeing again...

157
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:07,666
It's achieved with
the use of a device

158
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,291
similar to a video camera.

159
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:12,916
The concept is pretty
simple, actually.

160
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,000
Images and nerve
impulses...

161
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:19,125
They're essentially
the same thing.

162
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:21,541
Nothing more than
electronic signals...

163
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:22,833
But in order to begin,

164
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:25,625
you would need the
technology to convert them.

165
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:27,250
If it were possible
to convert

166
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:30,041
deliberately selected
information into nerve impulses,

167
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:32,166
you could control all
five human senses...

168
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,750
And in doing so, you could
exercise that control

169
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:37,458
over the will of
any human being.

170
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:40,875
Like I said, humans are
electronic devices...

171
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:43,916
Electricity travels through
every single nerve in your body,

172
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,416
not just your brain...

173
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,833
This means a person's
physical movements

174
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:49,125
can also be manipulated...

175
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:50,708
Are you following me?

176
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:55,416
This is insane.

177
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,916
She's even more
delusional than I am,

178
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,083
and that's saying something!

179
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:03,250
This world is filled with
evil deeds and corruption.

180
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:04,875
There are people
who ignore the moral

181
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:07,208
implications of their
actions and sacrifice

182
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:10,083
the greater good for their
own selfish interests.

183
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:12,250
And most have lost
their ability to feel.

184
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:14,916
Ignorance is a crime...

185
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,708
Some say ignorance
is bliss

186
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:18,333
but that's just
being spoiled.

187
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:19,833
Doubt this world and
understand its mechanisms

188
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:21,500
if you want freedom...

189
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:23,583
Do you understand?

190
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:25,833
'Cause this world
is far from perfect.

191
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,416
Is the life you
live real...?

192
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,958
Or illusion?

193
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:47,875
Please give me
some strength...

194
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:49,750
Give me courage.

195
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:54,000
Hello, it's me,
Yua Kusunoki...

196
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:55,750
If it's all right,
I would really love

197
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:58,541
to be able to speak
with you one more time.

198
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,708
I'll be at your place
tomorrow night at five p.m.

199
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,375
Well... Guess we sent it!

200
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,333
First she tricks me and
now she wants to talk to me?

201
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:24,541
I don't trust her, she's
probably come up with some

202
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:26,291
clever new way
to deceive you!

203
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:28,625
If I were you, I
would just ignore her!

204
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:30,125
Even if I don't respond,

205
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:31,791
she said in the email
she's coming over...

206
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:32,958
so I-. Okay...

207
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:34,250
You should hide in
the internet café

208
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:36,083
till she gives up
and goes home!

209
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:37,333
The last thing
I want to do

210
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:38,666
is spend a night
away from you,

211
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:41,000
but this is for
your protection, Takki.

212
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:42,166
Seira baby.

213
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:51,833
I'll wait till
after midnight.

214
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:54,000
There's no way she'll
stay that late.

215
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:56,041
Yua rides the train and
the last one leaves

216
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:58,666
way earlier, so she'll
have to get on it.

217
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:03,041
Oh no, it's her!

218
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:07,250
Shut up!

219
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:09,375
Don't make a sound.

220
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:11,500
Promise you'll stay quiet.

221
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:13,166
I want you to
listen to me.

222
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:15,125
Hear what I have to say.

223
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:17,166
You listening...?
Please...

224
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,875
Please... Listen... Okay?

225
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:22,125
I want you to keep
your mouth shut.

226
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:27,250
I'm sorry to burst in...

227
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:29,541
There's one little thing
that I have to say to you...

228
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:31,208
I want to help you, Takumi,

229
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:32,791
I just can't stand
to see you suffer

230
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:34,458
and live your
life like this.

231
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:37,958
I'm begging you... Please.

232
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:41,000
Just stop murdering the
people of this city!

233
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:42,416
What?

234
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,375
Look, I know you don't
think that you're doing it...

235
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:45,625
But I've done some
research that explains

236
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:47,458
why you don't remember...

237
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:49,166
It'd be impossible...

238
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,166
You couldn't have any memory
of what you've done...

239
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:54,291
You have DID,
multiple personality.

240
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:55,708
At first, I was planning
to turn you over

241
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:57,750
to the police
department.. .

242
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:58,875
And if that wouldn't work,

243
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:01,500
I even considered
ending you myself.

244
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:03,208
But as I learned more
about the situation

245
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:07,250
I began to realize that you
were suffering as well.

246
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:09,750
I want to rescue you...

247
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:12,250
Let's go to the
hospital together.

248
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:15,875
She's insane, her delusions are
completely out of control...!

249
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:18,333
She's being totally
incoherent!

250
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:19,833
But... Hold on...

251
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:22,583
Is she really not
making any sense?

252
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:23,875
It's true...

253
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:26,875
I don't really know
myself anymore.

254
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:28,541
I posted stuff online
as the General

255
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:30,708
without knowing that
I had done it...

256
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:32,750
I'm somehow friends
with a girl named Rimi

257
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:35,458
even though I have no
recollection of her at all.

258
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:37,375
It's a me that
isn't a me...

259
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:39,916
A personality that
isn't my own...

260
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,166
DID?

261
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:44,333
It's impossible...

262
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:46,125
There's no way this is real...!

263
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:48,500
I refuse to
believe her lies.

264
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:50,291
This must be
her delusion...

265
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:52,500
Yua is my enemy!

266
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:54,000
She's trying to
trap me again...

267
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,583
She's trying to
break down my mind!

268
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:58,791
No way I'll ever
believe this bitch!

269
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:08,833
Takumi.

270
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,791
No! Let go!

271
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,083
Hey, watch it!

272
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:49,791
She's telling the cops...!

273
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:51,291
What is she doing...?!

274
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:52,291
What is she doing? !

275
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:57,666
No...

276
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,625
No...! No!

277
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:07,708
I can't get caught...

278
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:09,875
My life will be over!

279
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:12,125
They'll put me in prison
for a crime I didn't commit.

280
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:14,875
They might even give
me the death penalty!

281
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:16,166
I don't wanna die...

282
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,583
I'm not ready to die!

283
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:25,500
Where are they...?

284
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:26,625
I think I got away.

285
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:32,458
You need to come
with me right now.

286
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:33,458
We have to hurry.

287
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:34,875
Come.

288
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:50,875
Hey I don't think
they saw us,

289
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:52,541
I think we might
have lost them.

290
00:15:57,208 --> 00:16:00,458
Wow, look how
amazing her body is.

291
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:01,666
I bet she'd look awesome

292
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,125
in one of those pro
swim team uniforms...

293
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:05,458
No, wait a sec...

294
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:09,708
She'd look even better
in a Suimei Academy suit.

295
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:11,041
You were being
chased, weren't you?

296
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,166
Police...?

297
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:17,375
Yeah, me too...

298
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:19,708
They've been asking questions
about my song lyrics

299
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:22,208
and if they're connected
to some kind of incident.

300
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:23,625
They won't leave me alone.

301
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:28,500
Unfortunately, it looks
like I'm a suspect...

302
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:29,750
What's your story?

303
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:30,958
What are they
after you for?

304
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:33,875
She ratted me out.

305
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:35,333
Huh?

306
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:36,458
This woman...

307
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:38,500
She went to the police...

308
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:41,583
She told them that I was
the New Gen criminal.

309
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:43,125
It looks like you and I

310
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:44,958
are in the same predicament
then, aren't we?

311
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:47,083
But... I didn't do
anything, I swear it,

312
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:48,583
I'm an innocent man...

313
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:51,208
I didn't kill anybody!

314
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:54,166
Don't worry, this must be some
part of a larger purpose...

315
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,291
A divine plan from
a higher power.

316
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:57,916
Huh?

317
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,041
What is that
supposed to mean?

318
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:01,583
It really doesn't matter

319
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:05,000
whether or not the things you
see are real or illusions...

320
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:07,291
All the suffering and
heartache you've endured...

321
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:09,750
Every bit of it
was necessary...

322
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:11,458
But you have to find it...

323
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:12,708
Find your sword.

324
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:14,666
You're talking
about a di-sword.

325
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:15,750
Yes, that's right...

326
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:17,583
Somebody's done
their homework.

327
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:19,583
I bought one
the other day.

328
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:21,125
But I already broke it.

329
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:22,666
Yes, I remember that...

330
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,875
I saw you...

331
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:25,958
You were holding onto
that big toy sword

332
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:27,333
like an embarrassed child.

333
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:29,875
Aw man, she saw me.

334
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:32,166
-A toy?
-Your sword was a fake...

335
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,833
A di-sword's not
something you can buy.

336
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:36,083
Wait a sec...

337
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:37,833
Tell me what to do,

338
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:39,500
how can I get
one of my own?

339
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:44,708
Watch me.

340
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,333
Wow...

341
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:11,208
A di-sword.

342
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:14,166
Your sword holds the
key to your fate...

343
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:16,958
These weapons are a convergence
of many lamentations.

344
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:18,166
They are intended to meddle

345
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:20,125
in the affairs of a
transcendental place.

346
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:22,375
Wait, what do you mean,
"a transcendental place?"

347
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:23,541
A separate world...

348
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:24,833
another dimension...

349
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:26,333
A totally different possibility

350
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:28,083
co-existing
with what we see.

351
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:29,458
Basically a delusion.

352
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:32,166
A delusion?

353
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,791
It doesn't matter
what you call it.

354
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:34,916
What does matter is that

355
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,916
the di-sword exists
in that territory,

356
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,583
and it's the only
place you can find it.

357
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:41,083
Wait I don't understand...

358
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:42,458
Are you saying
that a di-sword

359
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:44,666
is a byproduct of
our imaginations...?

360
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,791
But that doesn't
make any sense!

361
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:47,833
No.

362
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:49,125
Words are deceiving.

363
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:50,375
Don't let them
get in your way.

364
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:52,416
Turn around and
see for yourself.

365
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,958
Huh?

366
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:00,833
I'm sorry!

367
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:03,875
This is simply a
delusion you wished for.

368
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:04,875
Look, boss...

369
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:05,958
What's the point
of going back

370
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:08,250
to the scene of the
staking crime...?

371
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:09,541
I feel like we
should be following

372
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:11,916
that Takumi Nishijo kid.

373
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,791
Yep, that's what
I thought...

374
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:15,416
Look... You see it?

375
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,375
Uh... See what?

376
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:20,083
Notice anything about the
way the coin's moving?

377
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:21,750
Doesn't it seem like
its movement pattern

378
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:23,833
is making a sort of
elliptical shape?

379
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:25,583
Yes, but I'm not
doing anything.

380
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,250
That's a little bit weird.

381
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,500
Of course you can't
witness something like this

382
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:32,083
just anywhere
in Shibuya.

383
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:33,291
Although apparently,

384
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:34,500
there are several dozen
places in our city

385
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:36,291
exactly like this one.

386
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:38,125
Yeah, it's a pretty
unusual occurrence...

387
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:39,041
But I don't get it.

388
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:41,041
What's it supposed to mean?

389
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:42,208
Well...

390
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:43,750
Do you know why
Shibuya's a destination

391
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:45,541
for so many young people?

392
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:49,000
Because coins move
elliptically for some reason?

393
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:51,500
Very funny, but
you're not far off.

394
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:53,958
Why do you think Shibuya
attracts so many young people?

395
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:56,375
What is it that
brings them here?

396
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:57,875
Why this place...?

397
00:19:57,958 --> 00:19:59,833
Because you could search
the whole world over

398
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:02,166
and you wouldn't find
anywhere like this.

399
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:05,291
A world full of options
but they still come here...

400
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:06,708
To this great city...

401
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:08,833
Its name stands alone.

402
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:12,041
But what does any of this have
to do with the di-sword?

403
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:14,541
The idea that we're the
City of Young People...

404
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:16,541
It's a fact known
across the world...

405
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:18,125
Why is that?

406
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:20,041
It's the Great Will...

407
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:22,500
A powerful existence
bigger than everybody,

408
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:24,291
the will of the universe...

409
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:26,916
And the di-sword gives
guidance brought by that will.

410
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,708
There are a few
places in the world

411
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:30,041
where gravity is unbalanced.

412
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:31,666
Shibuya is one of them.

413
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,750
Unbalanced...?
I don't get it.

414
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:35,083
The gravitational forces

415
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:37,500
are what made the pendulum
move elliptically...

416
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:39,666
It's referred
to as a GE Rate.

417
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,250
I've never heard of it.

418
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:43,583
Apparently, Shibuya's GE
Rates are off the charts,

419
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:44,833
the highest in the world.

420
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:46,708
Are you serious?

421
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:47,875
That doesn't
make any sense.

422
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:49,416
What does the
balance of gravity

423
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,083
have to do with young people
being attracted to this town?

424
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:53,791
Basically, it's because
there's an unusual link

425
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:56,416
between human
beings and gravity.

426
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,333
For example, were you aware
the biorhythm of a person

427
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:01,791
is directly affected
by lunar gravity?

428
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:03,375
Biorhythms, huh?

429
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:06,500
It's connected, not only to
normal psychological phenomena,

430
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:07,916
but also to
traffic accidents,

431
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,625
crime, illness, hunger,
and to carnal desires.

432
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:13,583
Don't you think
that's a bit extreme?

433
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:15,791
There's a "group
psychology," right...?

434
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:17,458
If you slip the idea

435
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:21,708
that Shibuya is fun into their
unsuspecting, unconscious minds,

436
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:22,916
then over time...

437
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,291
They'll start
to believe it!

438
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:27,083
That's a very
interesting theory

439
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:28,625
and I'm really glad
you shared it with me,

440
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:30,291
but I don't see how that's
supposed to help us find

441
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:31,708
the New Gen perp.

442
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:34,375
If every single crime
scene had abnormal GE Rates,

443
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:36,166
think what that would
mean for our case.

444
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:39,041
What conclusion
could we draw then?

445
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:41,041
Wait... Does that mean...?

446
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:42,500
If New Gen incidents
are happening

447
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:45,250
where GE Rates are
especially abnormal...

448
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:47,041
Then we should be able
to predict the location

449
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:48,125
of the next incident!

450
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,625
Yes, and that's just
what we're gonna do.

451
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,958
And the di-sword gives
guidance brought by that will.

452
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:57,500
But I still don't
understand,

453
00:21:57,583 --> 00:21:59,083
how am I supposed
to get one?!

454
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:01,208
Teach me... Please!

455
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:03,375
It isn't something
that can be taught.

456
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:04,500
Why not?!

457
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:05,875
You are the only one
who can find it...

458
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:07,375
You must do it alone.

459
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:10,208
There is no method we can
teach because we don't know.

460
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:12,166
But di-swords are only
visible to human beings

461
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:13,833
with special abilities.

462
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:16,458
You have the power to see
my sword, don't you...?

463
00:22:16,541 --> 00:22:18,416
And that can only
mean one thing.

464
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,958
Feel it now...

465
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:22,083
Feel everything the Great
Will has chosen for you.

466
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:27,375
What is your name?

467
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:29,958
My name is
Ayase Kishimoto.

468
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:31,958
I'm Takumi... Nishijo.

469
00:22:33,708 --> 00:22:34,833
Let's meet again...

470
00:22:34,916 --> 00:22:36,083
Takumi.

471
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,875
It was a fake all along.

472
00:22:58,958 --> 00:23:00,833
Where do I find
the real one then?

473
00:23:03,083 --> 00:23:04,375
You've got mail...

474
00:23:04,458 --> 00:23:05,750
You silly boy.

475
00:23:07,083 --> 00:23:08,625
A message from Grim...

476
00:23:08,708 --> 00:23:10,208
"This video is
pretty shocking.

477
00:23:10,291 --> 00:23:12,708
It's intense, you
should check it out!"

478
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:14,250
"It's footage of
the mastermind

479
00:23:14,333 --> 00:23:17,416
behind the New Generation
Madness killing spree.

480
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,041
"The criminal's on here?

481
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:21,458
Did they get a
look at his face?

482
00:23:25,208 --> 00:23:27,875
I want to rescue
you, Takumi.

483
00:23:27,958 --> 00:23:29,041
Just shut up...!

484
00:23:29,125 --> 00:23:30,958
I didn't do anything,
it's not me!

485
00:23:41,375 --> 00:23:42,666
What's this?

486
00:23:47,958 --> 00:23:49,208
No.

487
00:23:49,291 --> 00:23:51,250
Stop it... Stop it...

488
00:23:51,333 --> 00:23:52,500
Stop it!

489
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,958
Oh please.

490
00:23:59,041 --> 00:24:01,000
No... No, please don't!

491
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:04,291
No, don't jump!

492
00:24:09,333 --> 00:24:10,500
Those eyes.

493
00:24:10,583 --> 00:24:11,666
Whose are they?

494
00:24:13,916 --> 00:24:15,041
Oh no.

495
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,625
Why does that phrase keep
coming up again and again?!

496
00:24:49,125 --> 00:24:50,500
I know that sound.

497
00:24:59,708 --> 00:25:02,166
The filming angle's a little
low, don't you think...?

498
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:03,375
General.

499
00:25:07,208 --> 00:25:12,916
[Music]

500
00:26:43,333 --> 00:26:44,500
Those eyes.

501
00:26:44,583 --> 00:26:45,625
Whose are they?
