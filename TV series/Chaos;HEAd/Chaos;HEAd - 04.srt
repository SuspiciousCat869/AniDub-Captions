3
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,875
I'm Takumi Nishijo...

4
00:01:40,958 --> 00:01:42,541
To find out if
Yua's accusation

5
00:01:42,625 --> 00:01:44,541
that I'm the
General was true...

6
00:01:44,625 --> 00:01:45,875
I went to the
same hospital

7
00:01:45,958 --> 00:01:48,000
I used to go to in
elementary school.

8
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:50,708
But... I didn't
learn anything new

9
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:52,750
'cause I was too
scared to ask...

10
00:01:52,833 --> 00:01:55,041
I wanted to do something
about it so I investigated

11
00:01:55,125 --> 00:01:56,625
the image the
General sent me

12
00:01:56,708 --> 00:01:58,333
and did a little research...

13
00:01:58,416 --> 00:01:59,958
Turns out a local
band predicted

14
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:01,916
the second New Gen crime...

15
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,875
The lead singer's
name is FES...

16
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:05,291
After listening
to her song,

17
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,458
there's no doubt in my mind,

18
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:07,916
she must've
known something.

19
00:02:09,416 --> 00:02:10,958
After that I was told
another New Gen incident

20
00:02:11,041 --> 00:02:12,916
had already taken place...

21
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,708
And the dying message left at
the scene of the crime...?

22
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:17,750
I know it all
too well.

23
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:20,291
It's the same phrase I
often whisper in my mind.

24
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:32,291
Hey, did you see those pictures
from the Vampire killer?

25
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:33,625
Yeah, I did!

26
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:35,250
Did you see the message?

27
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:36,833
"Those eyes,
whose are they?"

28
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:39,875
Hey, pretty lady!

29
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:41,000
What's up...?

30
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:42,708
Wanna play whose
eyes are those?

31
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:43,916
You're an idiot.

32
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,833
Ah, come on, baby.

33
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:47,750
Get set... Go!

34
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:49,458
Those eyes,
whose are they? !

35
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:51,125
-I won!
-Oh, man!

36
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,583
Whose eyes are those?

37
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:10,375
It's not me...!

38
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:12,041
It's not me...!

39
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,833
It just can't be me!

40
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:32,458
You.

41
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:33,500
Do you see it?

42
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:35,291
Answer me.

43
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:37,458
I want you to tell
me if you can see it!

44
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:42,750
Please... What the
hell are you doing? !

45
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,500
So I was right all along.

46
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:47,791
Don't hurt me...

47
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:48,750
I'm sorry...

48
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:50,750
I didn't see anything...
I swear!

49
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:52,750
Liar... I know you did...

50
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,875
I know 'cause you were
staring at it just now.

51
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:56,750
No... Please I
really didn't...!

52
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:57,875
I didn't see-!

53
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:06,833
I'll make you
tell me the truth.

54
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:13,208
Well now... How's that...?

55
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:14,833
Is it good...?
Do you like it?

56
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:18,625
What's wrong...?
Don't like it?

57
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:21,125
Oh no!

58
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:23,708
Fess up...

59
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:25,041
Tell the truth...

60
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:26,250
You see it, don't you?

61
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:31,000
What...? Was
that a delusion?

62
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:34,458
That's right...
You should be scared...

63
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:36,458
I am pointing a
di-sword at you.

64
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:38,291
Di-sword...? What's that?

65
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:41,708
It's true...

66
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:43,375
You've been gathered,
just like me ...

67
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:45,833
Tell me, have you
witnessed an error yet...?

68
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:48,833
Let me know if you do.

69
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:52,416
I'm Sena Aoi and
I'm a third year...

70
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,791
I'll be at the
train station.

71
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:07,958
It's those eyes...
Whose are they, my man?

72
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:09,166
Just kidding...

73
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,500
Isn't it nuts how
popular that saying is?

74
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,375
Hey...! You remember FES
from that Phantasm concert

75
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:16,958
we went to, right?

76
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:21,083
Those eyes,
whose are they?

77
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:22,833
Well guess what
I found out...

78
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:24,958
There's this girl,
Ayase Kishimoto.

79
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:26,333
She hardly ever
comes to class,

80
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:28,583
but she's one of the hottest
chicks I've ever seen.

81
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:32,750
This Ayase girl's really
FES, the lead singer.

82
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:35,333
Man, how awesome
is that, huh? !

83
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:36,958
To think a super
hot rock star's

84
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:39,250
actually a student
at our school...!

85
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:40,875
I suppose it's
my destiny

86
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:42,375
to make her fall
in love with me.

87
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:46,250
Well, speak of the devil.

88
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:48,416
You're about to see
a master at work...

89
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,750
Here's a lesson . I sure
hope you're taking notes.

90
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:53,000
Ayase. Hi there,
I'm Daisuke...

91
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:54,166
Nice to meet you.

92
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,583
You know...

93
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:58,000
I was at a Phantasm concert
just the other night...

94
00:05:58,083 --> 00:06:00,416
And your voice...? It
was just incredible.

95
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,875
I swear, it blew me away.

96
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:03,125
By the way.

97
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:04,541
I'm thinking about
starting my own band,

98
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:06,708
and I was wondering if you
might want to get together

99
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:09,125
sometime to give me
a few pointers...

100
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:10,333
Hey, what's wrong?

101
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:15,750
Oh no...! She
looked at me again!

102
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:18,125
Sorry, I already
have someone I like.

103
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:20,750
Ooh, really...? It isn't
me by any chance, is it?

104
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:22,166
He's right there.

105
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,500
Who, him?

106
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:24,958
I, uh...

107
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:26,625
You came to my
concert, didn't you?

108
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:29,958
I felt it at first glance.

109
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:34,291
You are the one I'm
destined to be with.

110
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:38,041
I know it... You...

111
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:39,958
and I.

112
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:41,625
We will get married.

113
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:43,333
What...? Married?

114
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:44,416
What's wrong?

115
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:48,083
Uh... I don't, uh-

116
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:49,375
I don't know.

117
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:56,958
That must've
been a delusion.

118
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,916
Hurry up.

119
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,750
You must find it...

120
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:04,625
If you can find your
sword you will be saved.

121
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:11,541
Damn.

122
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:13,541
I thought she was into me.

123
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:14,916
Sword?

124
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:22,375
Finally, I got the new edition
of the Seira action figure...!

125
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:23,916
I'd better get home
as quickly as I can

126
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,791
to give her a
thorough inspection.

127
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:34,708
Do you have a minute?

128
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:38,041
Here's my identification
in case you're curious.

129
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,000
The police?

130
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:41,958
You haven't heard
anything about

131
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:43,166
what the kids are calling

132
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,291
"New Generation
Madness", have you?

133
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:47,458
Uh... Sort of.

134
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:48,791
Right...

135
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:49,833
Then I'm assuming you've
heard of the so-called

136
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:51,833
'staking' incident,
is that correct?

137
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:54,250
See, me and my partner here,

138
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:55,875
we're looking
for a witness...

139
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:57,208
Ah... I forgot...

140
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:58,666
Could you tell
me your name?

141
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:02,541
I see...

142
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:04,041
What's the matter? You're not
gonna answer us?

143
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:08,833
Uh... Um, Takumi... Nishijo.

144
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:10,666
So your full name's
Takumi Nishijo?

145
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:15,250
That looks like a Suimei
uniform you got on...

146
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:16,166
What year are you?

147
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,291
Two.

148
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:19,000
Huh? What's that...?

149
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:20,916
I couldn't hear
you... Say it again.

150
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,625
Uh... second year, yeah.

151
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:24,625
Ah... I see, you're a junior.

152
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:27,458
So... Mr. ishijo...

153
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:29,208
Can you please tell
me where you were

154
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:31,500
and what you were doing
on the 29th of September...

155
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:34,125
Between six and ten p.m.?

156
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:36,000
Does he want my alibi...?

157
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:38,000
Wait, does this
mean I'm a suspect?

158
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:40,666
Listen, kid... Don't worry,

159
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,750
we don't think you had
anything to do with this.

160
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:44,250
Look, I didn't do it.

161
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:45,625
Oh...?

162
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:47,458
What exactly
didn't you do?

163
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:50,125
I saw it!

164
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:50,916
I saw it happen!

165
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,000
The staking...! I
saw the killer, too...!

166
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:56,833
She had blood all
over her hands...!

167
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:58,916
Stakes pierced through his body.

168
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,541
It was horrible...

169
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:02,166
She saw me.

170
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,375
She's a wicked devil...!

171
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:04,833
She's not human...

172
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:06,958
Not... at... all...

173
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:08,541
A demon...

174
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:10,458
And she'll murder us all!

175
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:11,708
Her mind...

176
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:14,375
She has the power to
see into the future!

177
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:16,375
And she's got
everybody fooled.

178
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:18,958
She goes to school with
me and she's in my class.

179
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,958
Help! Please protect me!

180
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:34,958
A demon... This is
really good info...

181
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,875
It'll give us
something to go on.

182
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:39,125
And... I... promise,
it's the truth.

183
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:41,208
Oh, you don't have to
tell me. I get it...

184
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:43,125
It's valuable intel...

185
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,791
We need to get back to
headquarters immediately

186
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,375
and see if we
have any leads.

187
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:47,958
Wait, is this some kinda joke?

188
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:51,375
Uh... right, sir... Sure.

189
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:53,291
Now... Mr. ishijo...

190
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:56,125
I need your contact information
so we can stay in touch.

191
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:58,291
Wait, what for?

192
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:01,041
Well, we have to
protect you, don't we...?

193
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:03,166
Unless of course you wanna
handle that demon on your own.

194
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:05,916
Oh... okay.

195
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:12,166
Well... Thank you
for your time...

196
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,375
And don't worry,

197
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:15,125
there's no reason for
you to be afraid...

198
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:17,250
The police will
keep you safe.

199
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:18,250
Take care!

200
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:26,833
Finally.

201
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:29,333
I have been waiting
for this for so long!

202
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:33,541
Oh, they got the
skirt just right!

203
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:35,916
Oh, this is amazing!

204
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:39,291
This is the best
version by far!

205
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:43,125
You pervert... Geez!

206
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:46,500
Sorry...

207
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:47,750
Didn't mean to
scare you...

208
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:49,375
I knocked on the
door, you know.

209
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:50,625
Please don't hurt me...!

210
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:53,208
I'm so sorry I tattled
on you to those cops!

211
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:55,083
The cops?

212
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:57,250
Yes... That's why you
came here, isn't it...?

213
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:59,250
'Cause I talked to them...

214
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:01,541
I... told them about the
staking and everything else!

215
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:03,250
That again...?

216
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:05,875
Taku... You said Blood
Tune's Post Awakened version

217
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:07,375
came out today...

218
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,750
I came over to see
Seira, that's all.

219
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:13,000
Listen, we need to talk...

220
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:14,625
Taku has been acting
really strange

221
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:15,916
and avoiding me lately.

222
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,833
Hey... don't do that.

223
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:20,541
Takki... You be nice to Rimi,

224
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:22,208
she's one of your
best friends...

225
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:23,708
Silly boy.

226
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:26,125
Give me back my Seira...

227
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:27,541
Don't you touch my wife!

228
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,041
Oh, my love...

229
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,250
You're safe.

230
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:36,958
Um, hey Taku?

231
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:50,375
What the hell...?
What the hell...?

232
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:52,333
Having a romantic comedy
moment with that demon girl

233
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:54,541
isn't my idea
of a good time!

234
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:56,041
Sorry...

235
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:58,458
I think we got a
bit carried away...

236
00:11:58,541 --> 00:11:59,875
I should probably go home.

237
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:07,208
Taku... Are you coming
to school tomorrow?

238
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:08,958
I sure hope you
decide to go...

239
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:10,708
I get lonely
when you don't.

240
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:19,333
Will she be watching me...?

241
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:21,625
Is she planning on keeping
tabs on me every day

242
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:23,500
to make sure I don't do
anything she doesn't like?

243
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:47,208
General.

244
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:53,125
This doctor...

245
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:54,708
I've got to get him
to remember me...

246
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:56,666
If he can help me...

247
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,750
Maybe I'll finally
get some answers.

248
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,208
Well... Have a
seat, young man.

249
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:03,708
Wait, I... Um...

250
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:05,541
Where's my normal doctor?

251
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:07,875
Dr. akashina's no
longer with us.

252
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:09,541
Well, where is he?

253
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:11,208
He recently collapsed
due to stress

254
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:12,666
and needed time off.

255
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:13,916
He's been at
home ever since.

256
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:16,375
It's a trick.

257
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:18,416
Part of the demon
girl's master plan!

258
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:21,083
I'm alone...

259
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:23,541
Why isn't there
anybody on my side?

260
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:26,666
Why doesn't anyone care,
why won't someone help me...?

261
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:30,000
How come these terrible things
always have to happen to me?

262
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,375
I don't care who...

263
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:35,666
I just need someone to
reach out a helping hand.

264
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:36,958
Hurry up...

265
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:38,541
You must find it...

266
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:40,958
If you can find your
sword, you will be saved.

267
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:43,250
Sword... A sword...!

268
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:45,291
I have got to
get my sword!

269
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:48,541
It doesn't look like it's
a weapon from an anime...

270
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:49,708
If I just type in sword,

271
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:51,208
I don't get anything...

272
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:53,791
Just a bunch of gaming
walk through sites...

273
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,250
This is gonna
take forever...

274
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:57,666
I need something to
narrow the search.

275
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:58,875
You should be scared...

276
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:01,666
I am pointing a
di-sword at you.

277
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:02,958
The di-sword!

278
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:04,208
That's what she called it!

279
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:09,625
Yay!

280
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:14,125
"Di-swords, or 'dark
swords' were mysterious

281
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:16,875
weapons created in
Ancient Europe...

282
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:18,666
According to the legend,
these swords were crafted

283
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:21,125
by an infamous Devil King
who used them to arm an

284
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:23,541
infantry of ferocious
Black Knights."...

285
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:24,833
King Gladiale?

286
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:26,000
"The energy of
these swords derives

287
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:28,208
from the negative
emotions of human beings.

288
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:30,125
Allegedly, the di-swords
grew too powerful

289
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:31,791
and began to eat
away at the hearts

290
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:33,583
of the Black Knights
who wielded them...

291
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:36,458
However, unlike the majority
of holy or demonic weapons,

292
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:38,708
a di-sword cannot be seen
with the naked eye."

293
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:40,083
Crazy.

294
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:42,083
What is this, some
sort of a myth...?

295
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:43,291
Look at the
picture on here,

296
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:44,708
it's so plain looking.

297
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:47,541
That Sena girl's sword didn't
look anything like this.

298
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:50,083
"I bought one of these.

299
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:52,083
Apparently it's
called a di-sword.

300
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:53,625
It's a sketchy
part of Shibuya

301
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:55,166
but it's well
worth the trip.

302
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:58,041
Go to Town Vanguard and
buy one for yourself.

303
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:00,000
"Wow, you can buy a di-sword.

304
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:01,625
Hey, I don't think that
Town Vanguard place

305
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:03,458
is too far from here...

306
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:05,291
If you really need it,
you should go buy one!

307
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:14,791
Take your time
and look around.

308
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,333
Is that it?

309
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:33,375
I don't know about this,
what if it's a fake...?

310
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:35,375
Yeah, maybe I
shouldn't buy it...

311
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:36,666
Come on... Look
at this thing,

312
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,208
it's a big piece of junk...

313
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:40,333
But maybe when it
recognizes me as its master,

314
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:42,750
it'll transform
into something magical

315
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:44,333
and show me its true power.

316
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:46,958
I think I've been watching
way too much anime...

317
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:49,166
Ah... What should I do?

318
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,875
Ten thousand cash and
you get something extra.

319
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:53,916
And by the way...?
That is the last one.

320
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,708
Come on in!

321
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,375
Last one.

322
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:04,875
All right...!It's the last
one, must be my lucky day.

323
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:23,166
How can that Sena girl carry
around a di-sword all the time?

324
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,125
People were looking
at me like I'm an idiot.

325
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:32,916
Someone's here...!

326
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,500
No, what if it's
the demon girl? !

327
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:40,500
Taku?

328
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,250
What are you doing?

329
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:43,666
It's you.

330
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:47,083
You scared me.

331
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:48,333
Here you go.

332
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:50,875
Geez... You're a nerd,
you know that?

333
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:52,000
What is that?

334
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:53,500
Some kind of anime toy?

335
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:54,833
Hey, how's the phone...?!

336
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:56,125
You like it...?

337
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:57,500
You know you could
at least call home

338
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,458
and let us know
you're alive...!

339
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:01,291
Oh, do you have some tea?

340
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:03,666
I'd like some of
the hot kind...

341
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,333
Oh, wow... What is that thing?

342
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:09,750
Ooh, what a
pretty bracelet!

343
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:11,750
Did you buy this, too?

344
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:13,416
It came with the sword.

345
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,458
It's cool...

346
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:15,875
Hey, let me
have this, okay?

347
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:17,750
-Huh?
-Why not...?

348
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:19,541
Would it kill you to
give me something...?

349
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:20,708
Come on, give
me a present!

350
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:22,416
-Oh fine.
-Really...? ...

351
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,625
Yay!

352
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:26,208
What do you
think, Taku...?

353
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:27,750
How's it look?

354
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:30,083
I really like this, so no matter
what you say, it's mine...!

355
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:32,250
As a matter of fact, this
might be the first time

356
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:34,791
you've given me a present,
so how about that? !

357
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:36,291
You're finished with your
business here, right...?

358
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:37,500
Go home.

359
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:39,458
I really don't appreciate
your attitude...

360
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:41,250
Besides, what
about the oranges...?

361
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:43,375
And I do recall asking
you for some tea!

362
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:44,958
Make tea at home.

363
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:49,583
Suit yourself! . . . !

364
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:51,041
If I'm in the way,
then I'll leave!

365
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:54,791
I hate your guts...! I
hope you choke to death

366
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:56,916
on orange peels,
you stupid jerk!

367
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:00,916
You deserved that!

368
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:05,958
It's broken, my only hope!

369
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:12,000
Yo... Taku...

370
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:14,458
What's up, takin' a break
from otaku life...?

371
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:16,000
Hey, what's wrong...?

372
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:17,833
You in power
nap mode already?

373
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:19,250
Leave him alone!

374
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:20,958
The devil girl.

375
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:22,708
Taku needs some
peace and quiet...

376
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:24,625
Just look at
how tired he is.

377
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:26,833
It's from playing too
many video games...

378
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:28,833
Maybe you shouldn't
be so easy on him.

379
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:31,375
You're the enemy of all
women, you know that...?

380
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:34,583
And I'm never nice to
idiotic people like you...!

381
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:36,666
There, it's time
for school to start...

382
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:37,750
The teacher's coming.

383
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:39,000
Yeah, yeah.

384
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:49,125
Okay... Folks, we have a
transfer student starting today.

385
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:50,333
It's her first day...

386
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:51,750
Everyone say hi.

387
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:58,416
Well... It looks like
she's nervous...

388
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,791
Students, this is
Kozue, she's new here...

389
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:02,458
Be nice to her now, okay?

390
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,458
Go on... Take your seat.

391
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,833
He's just like me.

392
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:13,875
I'm so glad we're
in the same class.

393
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:17,875
Wait a sec.

394
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:19,166
Was she just
talking to me?

395
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:26,125
Hey, uh... Taku.

396
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:27,625
What did she say to you?

397
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:28,666
Damn it! She's a machine,

398
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,791
she's never gonna give up!

399
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:32,958
I'm sorry I'm curious...

400
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:34,500
When that transfer
student walked by you,

401
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:36,541
I swore I heard her
whisper something...

402
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:38,166
But I didn't hear
what though...

403
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,166
Do you two know each
other from somewhere?

404
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:43,875
I always assumed you weren't
interested in real women,

405
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:45,291
only in anime girls...

406
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:48,458
But maybe you are
interested after all.

407
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:50,125
Well if that's the case...

408
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:52,833
You're not by any chance
interested in... me maybe?

409
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:57,041
I just can't figure
this girl out...

410
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:58,250
Is she trying to murder me

411
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:00,833
or does she wanna
make me her boyfriend?

412
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:02,375
I'll stop
talking to her...

413
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:03,875
If I don't, I'm
gonna go insane!

414
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:07,458
Wait... Taku!

415
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:15,750
I've had enough...

416
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:17,625
I can't take this...

417
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:18,916
And the di-sword I
bought turned out

418
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,041
to be completely useless!

419
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:23,250
I can't go to the
hospital anymore...

420
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:25,958
I can't even go
to my own school.

421
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:28,166
Yua's at the
internet café...

422
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:31,166
And every time I get
online there's the General.

423
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:33,333
I shouldn't go outside,

424
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:36,083
I should stay in
my base forever.

425
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,875
Where'd they go,
what happened?

426
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:15,125
No way.

427
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:25,375
No... It can't be real!

428
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:26,791
This is a dream!

429
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:28,083
An illusion!

430
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:30,083
There's no way this
could be reality...!

431
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:31,833
Sure, I wanted to live
a quiet peaceful life

432
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:33,791
where people
didn't bother me...!

433
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,750
But that doesn't mean I
want to be completely alone

434
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:37,916
in a world with
nobody else in it!

435
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,083
Somebody's here...

436
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:46,250
I'm not alone,
somebody else is here!

437
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,958
Who are you?

438
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:52,458
I've been waiting a long time.

439
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:53,583
But... I just...

440
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:55,291
I... Where did...

441
00:21:55,375 --> 00:21:57,250
I don't understand, why
are we alone...?

442
00:21:57,333 --> 00:21:58,458
The streets are empty.

443
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:00,291
Where'd the people
go...? Tell me...

444
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:01,791
What is this about...?

445
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:03,750
Why is this happening?

446
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:06,958
I suppose I could give
you that information...

447
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:09,541
But tell me, did you
receive my message?

448
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:10,625
Message...?

449
00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:11,916
Who are you?

450
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:16,333
Those eyes,. whose
are they? Right?

451
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:19,416
The time is here...

452
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,000
Awaken. Now...!

453
00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:23,833
If you don't, many
people are going to die.

454
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:28,166
Wait... Who in
the hell are you?

455
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:30,208
You know...

456
00:22:30,291 --> 00:22:31,958
You call me the General.

457
00:22:35,375 --> 00:22:36,458
The General...?

458
00:22:36,541 --> 00:22:37,833
This guy is
really the General?

459
00:22:39,416 --> 00:22:40,916
Don't forget.

460
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,208
Be strong...

461
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:46,000
No matter what,
you can't give up.

462
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:56,875
Taku

463
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:58,000
What?

464
00:22:59,166 --> 00:23:00,541
Hey.

465
00:23:09,333 --> 00:23:11,750
Taku, Can you
walk...? Get up.

466
00:23:17,041 --> 00:23:19,083
No... Stay away!

467
00:23:19,166 --> 00:23:21,666
Hey... everything will be
fine, just come with me.

468
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:23,291
You... You were the one...!

469
00:23:23,375 --> 00:23:25,875
You showed me that delusion,
didn't you, you devil...!

470
00:23:25,958 --> 00:23:27,458
You did it...!

471
00:23:27,541 --> 00:23:29,291
You... You took
over my mind, demon...

472
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:32,958
To destroy me...! To
leave me for dead!

473
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:35,083
I am gonna kill
you... demon...!

474
00:23:35,166 --> 00:23:36,958
I'll go back to my base
and get my di-sword ...

475
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:38,500
I don't care if
it is broken!

476
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,083
Just stop it...!

477
00:23:47,166 --> 00:23:49,250
It's too dangerous
to stay here...

478
00:23:49,333 --> 00:23:50,583
The light.

479
00:23:50,666 --> 00:23:52,916
It already turned red.

480
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,333
She wasn't trying to
kill me after all...?

481
00:23:55,416 --> 00:23:56,916
But why is she helping me?

482
00:23:58,958 --> 00:24:00,750
If I continue to feel this
kind of warmth in my heart

483
00:24:00,833 --> 00:24:02,500
for her...

484
00:24:02,583 --> 00:24:04,416
If she keeps staring
at me so sweetly...

485
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,833
My thoughts...

486
00:24:05,916 --> 00:24:07,958
My thoughts will
begin to waver...

487
00:24:08,041 --> 00:24:09,291
I'll start to trust her.

488
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:13,333
Taku... Please, I want
you to come with me...

489
00:24:13,416 --> 00:24:14,416
Okay?

490
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:25,500
Thank goodness!

491
00:24:25,583 --> 00:24:26,916
I'm really sorry.

492
00:24:29,583 --> 00:24:31,916
But wow, you scared
me back there...!

493
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,541
I saw you lying
down on the ground

494
00:24:33,625 --> 00:24:35,333
right in the middle of
the intersection...!

495
00:24:35,416 --> 00:24:36,708
And if that light
hadn't been green,

496
00:24:36,791 --> 00:24:38,375
who knows what would
have happened to you?

497
00:24:38,458 --> 00:24:39,541
Bye.

498
00:24:39,625 --> 00:24:41,208
Wait... Should I
walk you home...?

499
00:24:41,291 --> 00:24:42,416
Since you're not
feeling well?

500
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:46,708
You sure?

501
00:24:48,625 --> 00:24:50,125
Um. Thanks a lot.

502
00:24:56,875 --> 00:24:58,125
You're welcome.

503
00:25:07,333 --> 00:25:12,291

504
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:46,208
Those eyes, whose are they?
