00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:39,791
Hi, my name is
Takumi Nishijo...

3
00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm a second year...

4
00:01:41,083 --> 00:01:42,916
I'm seventeen years old...

5
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,583
Basically, I am what you
might call an otaku...

6
00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:47,375
Right now, in
Shibuya where I live,

7
00:01:47,458 --> 00:01:50,041
a mysterious string of events
known as the "New Gen"

8
00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:52,916
has been terrorizing
our city.

9
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,708
I never had any interest in
the 3D world until recently.

10
00:01:56,791 --> 00:01:58,458
Ever since a guy
called "The General"

11
00:01:58,541 --> 00:02:01,291
showed me that image
predicting a New Gen Crime,

12
00:02:01,375 --> 00:02:03,875
I haven't been able to
get it out of my mind.

13
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:05,208
Especially now.

14
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,333
Because I saw it happen
with my own eyes,

15
00:02:07,416 --> 00:02:10,291
it was exactly like it
was in the picture.

16
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:12,166
Also... a girl I
go to high school

17
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,750
with might be the murderer.

18
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:18,208
What's worse...?

19
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:20,250
She's sitting right
next to me in class.

20
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:28,833
Oh... oh no-

21
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:32,625
The demon girl.

22
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:41,916
What's the
matter with you?

23
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,500
No... What are
you doing here?

24
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:45,208
What do you want from me?!

25
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:46,708
Oh... Help me...

26
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:47,958
Don't murder me...!

27
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:49,541
Please, I'm begging you!

28
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:50,750
Ten-hut...!

29
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:52,500
Stand up and get it together.

30
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:55,000
You're babbling like a
crazy person, you weirdo!

31
00:02:58,083 --> 00:02:59,708
Hey, what's wrong...?

32
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:00,791
Come on.

33
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:02,875
No way!

34
00:03:02,958 --> 00:03:04,041
I saw it...

35
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:05,416
I saw you...

36
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,541
You murdered that person.

37
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:09,125
Thanks a lot...

38
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:11,125
I don't know why you are
being so mean to me...

39
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:12,791
-What did I do?
-Wait...

40
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:14,041
You're going to
kill me, too...

41
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:15,208
Aren't you?

42
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:16,541
Well I certainly
never thought

43
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:18,625
I would be accused of
murdering somebody...

44
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:19,541
I don't like it.

45
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:21,625
Spare me.

46
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:22,583
Don't kill me.

47
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:24,541
Now stop...

48
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:28,500
I am utterly
offended Taku.

49
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,500
Taku.

50
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:32,541
Hey... How do you
know my name...?

51
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:34,750
Do you... know me?

52
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:35,958
Are you kidding...?

53
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:37,541
How long have
we been friends?

54
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:39,500
We're friends?

55
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:40,583
What are you up to?

56
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:42,500
Is this some kind
of a joke...?

57
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:44,541
I know I'm not the
smartest girl in class

58
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:46,333
and my grades aren't
spectacular...

59
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:49,250
But it hurts my feelings
when you make fun of me...

60
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:50,791
You should be ashamed!

61
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:52,208
Hey, who are you,
devil girl?!

62
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:54,208
I see, so you don't
even recognize

63
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:56,250
your own classmates anymore,
is that it...?

64
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:58,041
You jerk...!

65
00:03:58,125 --> 00:03:59,958
I guess there's not
much hope for you...

66
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:02,125
After all, you barely
show up for school so...

67
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:04,750
You don't know it...

68
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:06,583
You actually
forgot my name.

69
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:08,208
You didn't, did you?

70
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:09,333
You know it, right?

71
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:12,708
You ought to
know it, Taku.

72
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,291
It's... Rimi.

73
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:19,083
That's absolutely right!

74
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:21,916
Rimi...

75
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,250
Rimi Sakihata!

76
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:26,125
I'm really glad you
remembered me...

77
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:28,166
Wow, what a relief.

78
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,833
I don't understand.

79
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:32,083
How do I know what this
girl's name is...?

80
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:33,291
How?

81
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:35,750
Guys! What's up?

82
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:37,958
Hey...! Good
morning, Daisuke!

83
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:40,791
As usual, you're like a
couple of peas in a pod...

84
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:42,916
You should just date
and get it over with.

85
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,958
You're not gonna
believe this...

86
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:46,750
Taku was so mean
to me just now...

87
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:48,750
Oh man...
That's weird...

88
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:51,166
Daisuke acted like me and the
demon girl being together

89
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,916
is a normal thing...

90
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,750
That doesn't
make any sense!

91
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:56,666
Jeez dude.

92
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,125
You miss a couple
of days of school

93
00:04:58,208 --> 00:05:00,125
and you forget about
your closest friends...?

94
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:01,750
I would be one thing...

95
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:03,041
But you two've been
in the same class

96
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:04,333
since your first
year of school.

97
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:06,833
What...? We've known
each other that long?

98
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:10,875
Hello, we just hung out
together a few days ago...

99
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:13,625
See?

100
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:15,125
No... No way.

101
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:17,500
You know, someone as nerdy as
you should be thankful...

102
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:18,958
You are lucky you
have friends at all,

103
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:20,375
Mr. omputer Geek.

104
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:22,583
Hey now that
was a low blow.

105
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:23,916
Yeah, but it's true!

106
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,833
That girl...

107
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:40,875
I swear I've never seen
her before in my life.

108
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:42,875
At least I think...?

109
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:45,000
Just stop talking
to yourself.

110
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:46,583
You're having more of
those scary delusions,

111
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:48,041
aren't you, Takki?

112
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:50,708
Seira... You don't understand...

113
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:53,291
The demon girl is real,
she isn't a delusion.

114
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:54,583
Oh yes she is...

115
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:56,708
-Just trust me, okay?
-Yeah... But...

116
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:58,791
You're such a
worrywart, Takki...

117
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:01,291
Just relax, she'll be
gone before you know it...

118
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:03,916
Why don't you forget about
it and play your game?

119
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:08,166
Yeah... You're right...

120
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,500
I just need to forget
about the stupid 3D world.

121
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:13,500
You know it's true...

122
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:14,791
I'm like a god
at this game,

123
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,000
no one even comes
close to me.

124
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:17,791
That's the spirit!

125
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:19,125
Taku.

126
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:27,625
Don't even think
about running away...

127
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:29,291
I'll find you
wherever you go.

128
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:32,375
It is time...

129
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:33,541
Don't be scared...

130
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:34,708
Let it happen.

131
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:45,500
Guess that was
another delusion...

132
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:47,708
-What a relief.
-Taku...

133
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:50,291
It's really not safe to
leave your door unlocked.

134
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:53,333
Especially with all the
weird things happening lately.

135
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:54,875
Is this a delusion, too?

136
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:56,208
Every time I
come over here,

137
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,250
your Seira collection
has grown.

138
00:06:58,333 --> 00:06:59,291
Ow... Nope...

139
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:01,333
Reality.

140
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:03,250
Oh... Looky here...

141
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:06,250
Hey, that's the pre-awakened
figurine, isn't it?

142
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:07,666
That post-awakened version

143
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:10,291
has got to be coming out any
day now, don't you think?

144
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:11,666
How... How do you know that?

145
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,041
Well duh...

146
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:15,000
You told me a couple
days ago, silly.

147
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:16,958
That's not possible...

148
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:18,583
Hey... Hold on...

149
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:19,958
What are you doing here?!

150
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:22,666
Well, you didn't seem like
yourself at school today,

151
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,541
so I came over
to check on you.

152
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:29,166
You really
don't look good.

153
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,916
I know... I'll cook
you a nutritious meal.

154
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,458
That'll perk you up!

155
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:34,791
Please go home.

156
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:37,000
-What?
-Just leave me alone!

157
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,458
Inspector, let's
hear your report.

158
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:45,833
Inspector...

159
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:47,750
Inspector Ban, are
you paying attention?

160
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:49,000
Hey... Boss...

161
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:51,250
You're up now,
they're calling you.

162
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:53,166
Yeah... Sorry about that...

163
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,958
My partner here
will do the report.

164
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,500
But... I'm not prepared!

165
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:58,000
Improvise.

166
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,625
I apologize.

167
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:05,000
I wasn't aware I was
doing this presentation.

168
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:06,541
Moving on then...

169
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:08,875
We have footage of a suspicious
man near the incident.

170
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:12,250
Here it is now.

171
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:14,291
This was recorded by
private security cameras

172
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:15,875
located approximately
50 meters

173
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:17,583
from the scene
of the crime...

174
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:19,375
As I'm sure most of you
gentlemen are aware,

175
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,791
according to the statements
given by nearby residents,

176
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:23,250
several different witnesses

177
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:25,166
heard a distinct hammering
sound in the distance

178
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,708
between nine o'clock
and nine-thirty pm.

179
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:35,208
At 9:34 our mysterious
man runs by.

180
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:37,166
In other words...
he's fleeing the scene,

181
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,666
right after the
murder occurred.

182
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:42,166
Based on the crime
lab's analysis...

183
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,958
we're pretty sure
he's a young man...

184
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:46,708
Probably somewhere between
fifteen and twenty years old...

185
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:48,458
And there's more.

186
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:51,166
We were able to match his
clothes to Suimei Academy,

187
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,375
a private school
located nearby...

188
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:54,958
I'd like you gentlemen to
pay special attention

189
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:57,000
to what's in his right hand.

190
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:58,583
And what exactly
is this young man

191
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:00,083
holding in his right hand...?

192
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:01,541
A metal stake.

193
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,916
A stake that just so
happened to be the only weapon

194
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,916
used in this
particular murder.

195
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,791
Meaning this kid is most
likely our perp, correct...?

196
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:11,041
We even have him running
from the scene of the crime!

197
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:12,583
Yeah, it looks
that way to me.

198
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:13,833
Figures...

199
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:16,041
Stealing the best part
for yourself, huh?

200
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:18,750
Yep, he's finally
given himself away...

201
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:20,958
Best thing we can do is
catch the son of a bitch

202
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:22,333
and get him to
sign a confession.

203
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:26,458
Don't think about it...

204
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:27,958
Don't think about it.

205
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:30,208
The demon girl
isn't real...

206
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:33,041
Seira, my lover, please
lend me your strength.

207
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,958
No way... The demon girl.

208
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:39,916
Takumi, you there...?

209
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,666
I'm sorry to bother you,
can I come in?

210
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:43,916
Hey that voice is...

211
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:46,291
Yua?

212
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,958
We... have our appointment...

213
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:52,250
You did remember, right?

214
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:53,750
Huh?

215
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:55,500
You said you'd take
me to the anime store

216
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:58,375
to help me reserve a
Seira action figure.

217
00:09:58,458 --> 00:09:59,875
Oh yeah...

218
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:02,625
I totally forgot about it
because of the demon girl.

219
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,500
Hey, I hope it's okay

220
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:13,166
I dropped by your place
and picked you up.

221
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:16,416
Uh... It's no big deal.

222
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,041
Well...

223
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:19,875
Sorry for asking you to
do something like this

224
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:21,583
when we barely
know each other.

225
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:23,875
It's fine.

226
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:35,750
This is awful...

227
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:37,291
I think I'm
gonna be sick...

228
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:39,041
I'll hurry up and
get this over with,

229
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:40,375
then get back to base.

230
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:41,875
Taku?

231
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:42,958
Hey!

232
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:44,166
Hey who's the pretty girl?

233
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,666
Is she your girlfriend?

234
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:48,166
No, of course she's
not my girlfriend...

235
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:50,000
I'm just taking her
to the anime store

236
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,791
so she can reserve
an action figure.

237
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:53,833
Oh, so she's into
dolls, too...

238
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:55,166
That makes sense,

239
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,958
there's no way he could
get a girl like her.

240
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:58,958
Hey there, my name's
Yua Kusunoki,

241
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:00,625
I'm a friend of Takumi's.

242
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:02,791
Hi...! I'm his
sister, Nanami!

243
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:05,458
I'm so sorry for dragging
your brother along with me...

244
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:06,541
I needed help.

245
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:07,833
Oh, it's no problem...

246
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:09,541
He's a disgusting slob,

247
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:13,416
but by all means,
please take care of him.

248
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,041
Ow!

249
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:15,416
Now you listen up.

250
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,208
This girl is way out
of your league...

251
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:18,666
I think you're lucky

252
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,541
she'll even be seen in public
with somebody like you,

253
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:22,208
so don't screw
it up, okay?

254
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:30,125
Oh... Gosh I'm starting to
get a little bit nervous...

255
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:31,958
Promise me you won't
go home by yourself

256
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:33,416
and leave me here all alone.

257
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,000
I won't.

258
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:50,625
I'm sorry...

259
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:52,458
Not only did you
take me to the store,

260
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:54,833
but then I made you carry
all my stuff, too.

261
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:56,541
Oh no... it's nothing.

262
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:58,125
Oh I almost
forgot to ask you,

263
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:01,333
do you have a cell
phone by chance?

264
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:03,541
Well I guess we can't
keep in touch then.

265
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:05,166
Uh... in touch?

266
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:06,541
But wait...

267
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:09,125
You have a computer back
at your place, don't you...?

268
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:12,208
Maybe we should exchange
email addresses?

269
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:13,583
What for?

270
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,958
Uh... Well, uh...

271
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:17,666
When the action
figure's ready...

272
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:20,791
I'm going to have to come back
here and pick it up, right?

273
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:21,916
I really don't think
I have the courage

274
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
to go back to that
place by myself.

275
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:26,750
To tell you the truth...

276
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:29,625
I'd like to get to
know you better...

277
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,125
If that's okay
with you, I mean.

278
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:43,416
You've got mail...

279
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,291
You silly boy.

280
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:47,125
Yua...

281
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:49,583
Man, she's fast.

282
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:50,583
Good evening...

283
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:51,833
This is Yua...

284
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:54,125
I couldn't resist
so I emailed you...

285
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:56,750
I'm sorry for making you
come along with me today.

286
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:59,250
I really did have
an amazing time...

287
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:00,750
Maybe it's 'cause I've
never been to a store

288
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:02,250
like that before.

289
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:04,416
Or maybe it's because I got
to spend the day with you...

290
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,708
Taku.

291
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,666
Hey, what time do you think

292
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,625
you'll be going to school
tomorrow morning...?

293
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:14,333
Uh, you're probably wondering
why I want to know that, huh...?

294
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:16,833
It's no big deal, I just
wanted to say hi to you...

295
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:18,333
At the very least,
I hope we're lucky enough

296
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:20,541
to bump into each
other at some point...

297
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:21,583
Well, good night.

298
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:23,333
Have sweet dreams.

299
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:24,583
I'll write again soon.

300
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:29,625
Are you going to reply?

301
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:31,125
Huh...? Yeah right...!

302
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:32,583
I'm not writing her back...

303
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:34,791
2D girls are the
only ones for me!

304
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:39,166
I'll just delete this.

305
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,250
You bad boy!

306
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:43,083
Stop, that tickles.

307
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:54,500
Hey, who are
you looking for?

308
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:55,875
I can help you out.

309
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:57,083
Thank you very much...

310
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:59,291
I'm trying to find Takumi.

311
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:00,666
Taku...?

312
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,541
Well, he's absent today.

313
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:03,916
Oh I see.

314
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:07,166
-So you're a friend of Taku's?
-Yes.

315
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,166
Ah I'm surprised...

316
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,750
He never mentioned he had such
a beautiful friend before.

317
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:13,166
We just met actually,

318
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,208
we don't know each
other that well,

319
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:17,166
but yesterday Takumi and
I went to the anime store

320
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,833
and he helped me
pick out some things.

321
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:20,208
Wow, so you two went out?

322
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:23,666
So... What else did you do?

323
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,416
Huh...?

324
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,375
Well nothing really,
just shopping.

325
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:28,500
Oh, I see...

326
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:30,125
Then everything's fine...

327
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:32,166
I'm sorry for asking
such weird questions.

328
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,625
No... It's fine.

329
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:46,708
I don't care what
anyone else says...

330
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:48,583
That demon girl's
a delusion...

331
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:51,416
Seira... She's the
only one I can believe.

332
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,166
Takumi, wait up!

333
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:56,083
I saw you from behind,

334
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:57,333
at least I thought
it might be you,

335
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:59,958
so I started
calling your name.

336
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:02,541
I ran as fast as I
could to catch you...

337
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:05,625
I sure hope you're having
an excellent morning.

338
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:07,916
She won't give up,
will she...?

339
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,666
What is she
expecting from me?

340
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,333
Ah, I love you...!

341
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:14,166
Hold me!

342
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:20,541
Oh boy...

343
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:22,458
Oh boy!

344
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:24,500
Oh boy!

345
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:25,750
Oh boy.

346
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:27,250
What are you saying?

347
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:30,375
Hey... Did you get that
email I sent you...?

348
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:32,000
Did you have a chance
to read it yet?

349
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:33,541
Yeah.

350
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:34,458
That's great...

351
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:35,875
You didn't reply

352
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:38,375
so I was kinda worried you
hadn't gotten it yet.

353
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:40,041
Oh.

354
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:41,083
Um...

355
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,583
So I went to your
classroom yesterday

356
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:47,041
to say good morning...

357
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:48,875
They said you
were absent...

358
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:50,541
I thought maybe you'd
caught a bad cold

359
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:52,041
or something like that...

360
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:54,375
I was worried about you.

361
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:56,625
Well I hardly ever
go to school...

362
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:59,166
People think I'm a hermit.

363
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,250
Well that's too bad...

364
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:03,208
But hey, I'm glad I
ran into you today.

365
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:08,375
Just don't let those kids
at school get to you...

366
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:09,875
I don't care what
they say, Takumi,

367
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:11,375
you are not a hermit.

368
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:15,458
I... I'm sorry...

369
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:17,333
I should probably
keep my mouth shut.

370
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:18,875
Um... No...

371
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:20,666
Please... I'm used to it.

372
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:23,083
Well, I think
you're amazing...

373
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:25,583
Because despite all of the
people who make fun of you,

374
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:28,125
occasionally you still
try and go to school.

375
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:31,000
But... But I...
I'm not anything...

376
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:32,791
Just a nerd.

377
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:34,583
So you like anime
and computer games,

378
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:36,708
that doesn't mean
you're a nerd.

379
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:38,833
I like you just
the way you are.

380
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:39,958
What...?

381
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,375
What's her deal...?

382
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,041
Why is she saying this...?

383
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:45,125
Why is this girl
being so nice to me?

384
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:51,625
More importantly, why does
she make me feel so good?

385
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:58,333
Oh no! The tardy bell!

386
00:16:58,416 --> 00:16:59,625
I'd better go, Takumi.

387
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:00,958
If I don't hurry,
I'll be late!

388
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:02,125
Bye-bye!

389
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:08,500
Um... Do you have time
after... class...?

390
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:09,333
Are you busy?

391
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:11,083
Huh?

392
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:12,708
Well, uh, I
wanted to ask you,

393
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:13,958
I mean if you
don't have plans,

394
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:16,208
do you want to meet
up after school?

395
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:17,916
I thought you and I could
walk home together

396
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,666
or something fun
like that...

397
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,958
I'll wait for you in the
courtyard after school, okay?

398
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,125
See you later.

399
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:30,541
It's definitely
not a delusion...

400
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:31,750
Oh boy.

401
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:43,875
You're kidding me...

402
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:45,000
Wow.

403
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:53,166
Yua.

404
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,333
She really came...

405
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:58,166
She waited here
just for me.

406
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:01,666
I know she won't
betray me...

407
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,041
A person like her,

408
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:05,500
she might even be
able to save me.

409
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:12,958
Hey, you scared me.

410
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:15,333
You really came,

411
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:17,083
I was so worried you
wouldn't show up.

412
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:19,166
Uh, whaddaya think...?

413
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:21,375
You wanna walk
home together?

414
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:22,875
Uh... Yeah.

415
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:49,708
There's nothing special
about this place...

416
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:51,791
It's beautiful
and peaceful...

417
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:54,458
So why do I suddenly
feel like crying?

418
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:58,500
Hey, is everything
all right?

419
00:18:58,583 --> 00:18:59,625
Oh... Yeah.

420
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:04,375
Those little frogs?

421
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:10,416
I remember seeing
those somewhere.

422
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,916
The internet cafe...

423
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,208
Wait a sec...

424
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:15,291
Was she the one next door?

425
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:17,416
Do you like those?

426
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,666
Hoppy the Frog...

427
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,541
They're super
popular right now.

428
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:22,125
You can take one
if you'd like...

429
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:23,125
I have plenty.

430
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:26,333
That's weird...
It won't come off.

431
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:44,958
New Gen research...

432
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:46,666
Printouts.

433
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:47,791
Why?

434
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:51,500
Hey, what's that?

435
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:53,125
Say something...

436
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:54,500
Why won't she answer?

437
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:58,583
I can't believe that
I trusted her...

438
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:01,250
I started to believe
that she was on my side,

439
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,125
that she was really
a friend to me.

440
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:09,000
In the end, there's no
way someone like Yua

441
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:11,208
would ever like
someone like me...

442
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:14,250
She only got close to me
because she wants something.

443
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:15,500
This is bad.

444
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:16,958
This is really bad.

445
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:22,166
Don't move.

446
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,083
You stay right here...

447
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:31,750
I'm sorry I had
to trick you...

448
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:33,583
But you're no better...

449
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:35,833
You're hiding something,
too, aren't you...?

450
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:37,208
Tell me the truth.

451
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:38,750
She had this whole
thing planned out...

452
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:40,458
from the beginning...

453
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:43,000
Everything she told me,
every nice thing she said,

454
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:44,333
it was all lies!

455
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:45,916
Shit... Shit...!

456
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,833
I can't believe
I fell for it!

457
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:50,500
How could I have
been so gullible?!

458
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:53,916
Originally, I had planned to
do some more investigating...

459
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,875
but you found me out
so that's that...

460
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:59,291
There's something I need
to talk to you about...

461
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:01,708
And you're going
to listen to me.

462
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:03,833
You're going to tell
me what I want to know.

463
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:05,375
Do you understand, Takumi?

464
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:06,541
I will ask.

465
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:08,333
And you will answer.

466
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:09,625
'Cause if you don't...

467
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:21,583
You recognize this,
don't you...?

468
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:22,666
You've seen it?

469
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:26,583
Of course you have...

470
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:27,750
And don't try to
tell me otherwise

471
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:29,875
because I know the truth.

472
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:31,625
It would be odd
if you didn't.

473
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:33,041
You know it, don't you?

474
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,208
Don't you, Takumi?

475
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,625
After all, I found
it in your room.

476
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:42,708
On your floor,
under your bed...

477
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:44,291
Tossed on the ground...

478
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:45,708
It was you...

479
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:46,750
You left it there...

480
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:47,916
Did you throw it away...?

481
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,333
Hoping no one
would find it...?

482
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:51,875
Well someone did!

483
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:53,458
This weapon is
exactly the same

484
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:56,041
as the one used in the third
New Gen case, isn't it...?

485
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:57,375
It's the same.

486
00:21:57,458 --> 00:21:58,958
Tell me the truth.

487
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:00,125
Tell me it's
the same one...

488
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:01,500
Say it...

489
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:05,333
The same one used to pin
that poor man to the wall!

490
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:07,041
Oh no...

491
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:10,666
This girl really believes
I'm the New Gen murderer!

492
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,375
She thinks she's a cop...

493
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:16,083
The teenage detective
on the case, huh?

494
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:17,125
You're wrong.

495
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,625
I'm sorry...

496
00:22:36,708 --> 00:22:38,541
I don't mean
you any harm...

497
00:22:38,625 --> 00:22:40,208
All I wanted was
to confront you

498
00:22:40,291 --> 00:22:42,583
and find out if you knew
anything relevant...

499
00:22:42,666 --> 00:22:45,375
I'm really sorry, I didn't
plan on being so direct.

500
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:49,458
Also... There's one more
thing I need to confirm.

501
00:22:51,625 --> 00:22:54,291
Are you a clairvoyant, can
you predict the future?

502
00:22:54,375 --> 00:22:56,041
Huh?

503
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:57,916
I'm assuming you
have that power...

504
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,625
Otherwise there's
no explanation

505
00:22:59,708 --> 00:23:01,333
for the image on
your computer.

506
00:23:06,333 --> 00:23:08,041
But... But that's...

507
00:23:08,125 --> 00:23:10,458
Why would you have a picture
of the New Gen's third case

508
00:23:10,541 --> 00:23:12,958
stored on the hard drive
of your computer?

509
00:23:13,041 --> 00:23:14,958
And how did you get
that picture one day

510
00:23:15,041 --> 00:23:17,833
before the actual
event occurred?

511
00:23:17,916 --> 00:23:20,041
I... I don't know!

512
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:21,750
Some guy called the
General sent me a link

513
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:24,208
when we were chatting
online and I clicked on it!

514
00:23:25,208 --> 00:23:26,291
Wait a second...

515
00:23:26,375 --> 00:23:27,333
It's you...

516
00:23:27,416 --> 00:23:28,541
You're the General...

517
00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:30,541
Are you trying to set
me up or something?

518
00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:32,583
Please... Don't do this!

519
00:23:32,666 --> 00:23:35,166
I found this image stored on
a hard drive in a computer

520
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:37,291
in room thirty-seven
at the internet café.

521
00:23:38,833 --> 00:23:40,750
Wait, room
thirty-seven...?

522
00:23:40,833 --> 00:23:42,166
That's the room
I always go to.

523
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:51,000
Just look...

524
00:23:51,083 --> 00:23:52,625
This is a record
of all your chats.

525
00:23:56,166 --> 00:23:58,166
I noticed something
strange in there...

526
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:00,708
The time stamps of Knight
Heart and the General's chat

527
00:24:00,791 --> 00:24:02,125
don't line up at all.

528
00:24:05,208 --> 00:24:07,583
That's the list of your
entries as Knight Heart...

529
00:24:07,666 --> 00:24:11,291
The time stamp says you posted
on September 9th at three am...

530
00:24:11,375 --> 00:24:13,083
Then two days passed...

531
00:24:13,166 --> 00:24:14,666
And you went to the
internet café...

532
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:15,875
at seven o'clock.

533
00:24:15,958 --> 00:24:18,666
At the same time
the General posted.

534
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:19,833
What...?

535
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:21,916
What are you saying?

536
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,625
You were putting
on a one-man show.

537
00:24:24,708 --> 00:24:27,291
But I... I don't...

538
00:24:27,375 --> 00:24:29,708
Don't you get it?
You own both profiles.

539
00:24:29,791 --> 00:24:30,750
Stop it...

540
00:24:30,833 --> 00:24:33,333
Let me be!

541
00:24:33,416 --> 00:24:34,958
It's you, Takumi...

542
00:24:35,041 --> 00:24:36,125
You're the General.

543
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:52,375
It's not real...

544
00:24:52,458 --> 00:24:54,500
This isn't happening...

545
00:24:54,583 --> 00:24:58,166
I wasn't meant to be born
into a world like this...

546
00:24:58,250 --> 00:24:59,541
I've never belonged here.

547
00:25:07,291 --> 00:25:13,000
[Music]

548
00:26:43,375 --> 00:26:44,583
Those eyes.

549
00:26:44,666 --> 00:26:46,083
Whose are they?
