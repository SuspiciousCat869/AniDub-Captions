[Music]

2
00:01:40,208 --> 00:01:42,041
I'm Takumi Nishijo...

3
00:01:42,125 --> 00:01:44,125
With Rimi's help
and support,

4
00:01:44,208 --> 00:01:46,625
I continued to search
for my di-sword,

5
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:48,916
but I didn't even
know where to begin.

6
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,041
The fifth New Gen
incident occurred...

7
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:53,333
This one called
'Brainless.'...

8
00:01:53,416 --> 00:01:55,750
And as if the General
was provoking me,

9
00:01:55,833 --> 00:01:58,583
Dr. Takashina,
my old psychiatrist,

10
00:01:58,666 --> 00:02:00,208
was the victim.

11
00:02:00,291 --> 00:02:01,333
Plus...

12
00:02:01,416 --> 00:02:02,666
I also found
out that Ayase

13
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,041
had once been hospitalized

14
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:06,625
for severe psychological
problems...

15
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:08,958
"If I find my sword,
I'll be saved."...

16
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:10,833
But can I really
trust her...?

17
00:02:10,916 --> 00:02:12,958
Can I believe
anything she says?

18
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:16,541
The moment I
thought that...

19
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:20,041
a strange and powerful
earthquake struck Shibuya.

20
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:39,833
What in the hell
just happened?

21
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:43,000
Huh?

22
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:53,083
One p.m.?

23
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:55,208
I was unconscious for
more than an hour? !

24
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:59,500
No way... It's impossible.

25
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:02,916
Did I lose all my data,
including my gaming progress...?

26
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,291
Oh no.

27
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:06,250
What's the point
of going on now? !

28
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:09,541
Let me repeat this...

29
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:12,375
Today just before noon,
a five point magnitude

30
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:15,083
earthquake occurred with
Shibuya at its epicenter...

31
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:17,875
The casualties numbered
over two hundred.

32
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:19,416
But authorities have
yet to comment on

33
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,750
what happened immediately
after the quake...

34
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:23,166
A strange white light.

35
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,375
For unknown reasons,

36
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:26,416
a glow suddenly
illuminated the sky

37
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,291
and was accompanied by
unusually violent shockwaves.

38
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:35,333
Thank God...
It's not all gone.

39
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:37,875
The server kept a backup
copy of my save data!

40
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:41,375
But I don't understand.

41
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:43,083
What in the
world was that?

42
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:45,458
It felt like my whole
body was boiling,

43
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:47,125
melting from within...

44
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:49,625
That wasn't a
normal earthquake.

45
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:54,541
The General...? He could
be the one behind this!

46
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:56,291
I'll destroy you.

47
00:03:58,125 --> 00:03:59,208
A... A delusion?

48
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:02,291
Rimi.

49
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:06,000
Oh, Rimi... I
need you by my side.

50
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:07,916
You're connected to a
messaging service...

51
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,750
At the tone, please
leave a message,

52
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,125
Voicemail...? No.

53
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:15,583
That's right...
it's a school day!

54
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:22,291
What's happening?
She was sick, right?

55
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:23,333
Yeah, and apparently,

56
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:24,791
when everybody
found out about it,

57
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,833
it made her even worse!

58
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:27,916
Taku!

59
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:31,541
Aw man... This is bad...

60
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:33,041
Look there.

61
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:42,333
Ayase?

62
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:43,750
This delicate world
is overflowing

63
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:46,291
with malicious delusions.

64
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:49,500
I closed my eyes and
covered up my ears...

65
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:51,166
But nothing helped...

66
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:54,166
It was always there,
right by my side.

67
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,916
I wanted peace...

68
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,041
And I longed to go to the place
where the Great Will resides.

69
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:01,625
So I ripped my
heart into pieces...

70
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:03,625
and embraced the chaos...

71
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:05,375
I yearned to
be a vessel...

72
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:07,000
for the pain.

73
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:08,833
But Gladiale is
becoming stronger

74
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:11,166
with every single
day that passes...

75
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,791
And the time is
already here...

76
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:14,583
But where are they?

77
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:16,625
I can't find them...!

78
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:19,833
Is the legend of the
Black Knights true?

79
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:22,250
I've poured out my
heart through music...

80
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:24,541
But if that's
not enough...

81
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:25,791
Fine...

82
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:27,125
Hear me, Great Will.

83
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:31,791
Take me now...

84
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:33,916
I freely give you my soul!

85
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:39,375
We were not aware that
there would be triple digit

86
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:40,958
casualties in
the Second Melt.

87
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:42,291
What exactly went wrong?

88
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,750
Was there some sort of
flaw in the software?

89
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:47,583
No, the casualties were
within our estimates,

90
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:49,416
within mine anyway.

91
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,208
Then why didn't someone
notify us of this beforehand?

92
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:53,583
There are certain
preliminary arrangements

93
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:56,250
that must be made in order
to control information.

94
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:57,625
Don't forget who's
in charge here,

95
00:05:57,708 --> 00:05:59,333
I will not be at the
mercy of your whims,

96
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:00,666
do you understand me? !

97
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,208
Now, gentlemen...

98
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:04,083
Very soon, you won't have
to worry about

99
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:07,458
upsetting your constituents
or campaigning for votes

100
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:10,458
or covering up your tracks
because of some scandal...

101
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:12,041
A new day's upon us...

102
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:14,958
And we will change
this world forever.

103
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,458
Mind your tongue!

104
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:18,541
Just remember, your job
is to follow orders

105
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:20,916
and make sure things run
according to plan...

106
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,458
If you do what
we tell you to,

107
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:24,083
there won't be any problems.

108
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:26,291
We're the ones calling
the shots here.

109
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:28,083
Understood.

110
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:30,125
Now then, let's
hear your report

111
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:32,708
on the progress of the
second-generation machine.

112
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:35,375
The Noah II, of course.

113
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:47,500
Hey... It was you.

114
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:50,083
You real-booted
that flowerbed...

115
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:51,875
Because of that,
her life was saved.

116
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:55,041
Huh? What are you saying?

117
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:56,750
Don't play dumb
with me...!

118
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:57,875
So are you connected with

119
00:06:57,958 --> 00:06:59,958
the Church of Natural
Divine Light?

120
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:01,875
And where did you learn
that power from...?

121
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:03,958
Who taught you...? Tell me!

122
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:06,291
I don't... I don't
know what you mean!

123
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:10,875
So you're really not
involved with them?

124
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:12,375
You're telling me the
truth, aren't you?

125
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:13,708
What are you
talking about?

126
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:15,291
What's the Church
of Divine Light?

127
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:16,416
I'm sorry...

128
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,208
Forget I even
mentioned it.

129
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:19,583
No, wait!

130
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:23,333
So... What's this "power"...?

131
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:26,541
Tell me, did I really make
that flowerbed appear?

132
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:28,583
You wished for it and
then it came true.

133
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,916
It is possible to convert
delusions to reality.

134
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,583
Objects that aren't real get
mixed in with what we see...

135
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:37,041
In other words,

136
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:39,000
you can make people believe
these errors exist.

137
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,291
Yeah... but...

138
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:41,958
if they only think
they're there...

139
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:43,208
then they're...

140
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:45,375
really just figments
of their imagination?

141
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:47,375
The world can be explained
with three numbers:

142
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:49,541
Zero, one and negative one...

143
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:50,791
It's everything...

144
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:53,208
Our entire existence.

145
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:55,333
Di-swords are used as
accelerated gateways

146
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:58,250
to creating those
negative-ones...

147
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:00,958
But somehow, you accomplished
this without a di-sword...

148
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:04,250
How lucky to be able to
believe everything you see...

149
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:05,625
I envy that.

150
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:11,250
Wow... Sena really does
know something after all.

151
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:17,958
Let's move!

152
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:23,958
Ayase... Why?

153
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:31,125
What a waste of time...

154
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:32,250
In the end I didn't
even get to see Rimi.

155
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:35,458
Rimi!

156
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:39,875
-Nanami.
-Hey, Taku,

157
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:41,166
you'll never
believe this...

158
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,333
Something incredible
happened at school today!

159
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:44,875
This girl jumped
right off the roof

160
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:46,541
and landed in a flowerbed...

161
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:48,708
It was really terrible.

162
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:51,333
Oh the poor thing, I hope
she'll be all right...

163
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:53,083
I'm totally worried.

164
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:55,708
Yeah right, I'm
sure you are.

165
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:57,750
The earthquake was
pretty amazing, too...!

166
00:08:57,833 --> 00:08:59,125
My head was pounding.

167
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:01,083
It was the worst pain
I've ever felt...

168
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:02,625
Wonder why it hurt so bad?

169
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,000
Her too?

170
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:06,083
It's probably
just the quake...

171
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:07,791
But something's
not right today...

172
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:09,375
The city feels weird.

173
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:10,875
It's not because of me...

174
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:12,958
It's not because of me!

175
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:29,541
Takumi's pretty
popular, huh?

176
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:30,958
I didn't see
that one coming.

177
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,125
Hey Takumi...

178
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:37,208
It's not nice to make
girls cry, you know?

179
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:39,625
Did you use FES up
and toss her aside?

180
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:41,541
Takki, you naughty boy.

181
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:43,416
This is the worst...

182
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,208
Those damn jerks are never
gonna leave me alone...

183
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:47,916
Rimi... Where is she?

184
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:52,416
Daisuke.

185
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:56,375
What's wrong?

186
00:09:58,291 --> 00:09:59,625
Stop it...

187
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:01,791
Please, I'm not even
worth looking at!

188
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:03,500
Oh I think you're
worth it...

189
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:04,708
You're worth a lot...!

190
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:06,041
You were the one
who saved the girl

191
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:07,833
who tried to
commit suicide.

192
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:09,791
Without you she'd be dead.

193
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,208
You see? You
should always try

194
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:14,541
and look on the bright
side of life, Takumi,

195
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:16,583
that way you won't
be so depressed.

196
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:18,291
That voice...

197
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:22,166
It feels like it's resonating
directly inside my head...

198
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,375
A delusion.

199
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:26,041
Hey mister, I'm
not a delusion.

200
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,458
Kozzy is real...

201
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:29,500
I'm right here!

202
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:31,458
Who the hell
is "Kozzy"...?!

203
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:32,833
Where is "here"? !

204
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:34,958
You're totally wrong to
think you have no worth...

205
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:36,333
It's just not true...

206
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:37,875
Not one little bit...

207
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:40,166
You know what...?
They're the ones...

208
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,833
The people in class who
say mean things about you

209
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:43,583
are the ones who
are worthless.

210
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:45,083
Trust - Please
just stop it!

211
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:48,666
It's true...

212
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:51,041
I've completely lost my
mind, I've gone insane.

213
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,791
Rimi...

214
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:00,500
Rimi...

215
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:01,875
Help me...

216
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:03,625
It's like I'm
completely worthless...

217
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:05,000
Useless.

218
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:08,833
Hey that hurt...

219
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:11,041
You... come with
me for a second.

220
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:22,083
What's wrong...? You
done already, kid?

221
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:23,750
What should we do now?

222
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:24,791
I don't know, I guess
we should rough him up

223
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:26,250
a little more...

224
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:28,250
That is what the man
said he wanted after all.

225
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:29,458
Well, I'll tell
you this much,

226
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:30,666
he must really
hate this guy,

227
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,333
paying us money to kick
his ass like this.

228
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:35,500
All right, let's get
to it, gentlemen!

229
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:40,500
I want to kill them...

230
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:42,375
Every last one of
these bastards...

231
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:43,833
I want their blood.

232
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:46,916
I want to watch
them all die!

233
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:01,041
What's that transfer
student doing here?

234
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:09,125
What the hell is this...?!

235
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:10,333
Did I...

236
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:12,375
I don't understand this,
what happened here?

237
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:28,750
Did I blackout back there?

238
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:30,625
How long was
I unconscious?

239
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,291
For about five minutes.

240
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:33,708
Again?

241
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:34,958
Whose voice is that...?

242
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:38,958
Oh no-

243
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:41,333
It can't be, that's
impossible...

244
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:44,291
Telepathy isn't real, how
is this happening to me?

245
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:46,666
How can I convince
you to believe me?

246
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,000
If you can hear me...

247
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:50,291
then tell me your
measurements.

248
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:53,458
Takumi, that's gross,
you are such a pervert.

249
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:54,541
That's true.

250
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:57,250
Okay... What's your birthday?

251
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:01,208
I was born on the
thirteenth of November...

252
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:02,791
See? Huh...?

253
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:04,375
No way... It's real.

254
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:05,875
That's what I've been
trying to tell you

255
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:07,250
from the very beginning,

256
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:08,625
but you wouldn't
listen!

257
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:10,208
It's really you, Kozue?

258
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:11,958
Call me Kozzy.

259
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,625
Kozzy, huh?

260
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:15,916
Come on... We should
probably get out of here!

261
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:20,875
How can she speak
to me with her mind?

262
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:23,375
I didn't even know things
like this were possible.

263
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:25,708
I guess it's a little
creepy, isn't it?

264
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:27,666
Do you think I'm a weirdo?

265
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,625
Honestly I don't mind...

266
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:32,125
Compared to the crazy people
I've been running into lately,

267
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:33,458
you seem pretty normal.

268
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:34,791
Crazy?

269
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:36,166
Oh yeah...

270
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,708
You do talk
kind of funny...

271
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:39,333
But I don't mind.

272
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:43,666
Oh thank you, that makes me
so happy I could just cry!

273
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,041
But wait a sec...

274
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,708
You said those
people were crazy.

275
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:48,291
How so?

276
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:50,291
Well.

277
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:52,041
One of the girls
looks really scary

278
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:54,250
and all she does is babble on
about incomprehensible stuff

279
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,000
like brain waves...

280
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:58,125
She also carries
around a huge sword.

281
00:13:58,208 --> 00:14:00,416
What kind of sword
is it...? A di-sword?

282
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,083
Yeah it is...

283
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:03,750
Wait... Hold on!

284
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:05,375
How do you know
about di-swords? !

285
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:07,541
'Cause I've got
one, silly boy!

286
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:12,625
Wow... A di-sword.

287
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:13,833
This is it!

288
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:15,000
Pretty cool, huh...?

289
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:17,541
I use my di-sword to
go after bad guys!

290
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:19,125
Bad guys, huh?

291
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:23,208
If you wanna
hear my opinion,

292
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:25,541
I don't think people like
that deserve to live!

293
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:26,875
It was you...

294
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:28,708
You were the one who took
them out, weren't you?

295
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:30,208
They're barely human.

296
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:32,833
Nothing more than a
bunch of cockroaches.

297
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:35,500
She's not malicious, she's
just so matter of fact...

298
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:38,083
It's like it's a regular
occurrence for her.

299
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:40,708
Yay! Sena's here!

300
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:41,958
Sena?

301
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:43,500
Kozue.

302
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:45,583
So you're friends
with Sena, huh...?

303
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:48,625
Uh, don't tell her I
said she was nuts.

304
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:50,875
I'm new to Tokyo and
when I got here,

305
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:53,416
Sena was the first
real friend I made.

306
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,000
She's the best!

307
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:56,500
Kozue...

308
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:57,916
What are you
doing with him?

309
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,625
Oh! Taku and I are
in class together!

310
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:02,291
Calling me "Taku" already?

311
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:03,583
And that's not all...!

312
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:06,583
He can see my di-sword
too, can't you?

313
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:08,000
Yes I'm aware...

314
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:10,291
He's also a gigalomaniac
just like we are.

315
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:11,916
Gigalo-... What was that?

316
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,041
A "gigalomaniac"...

317
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:16,375
It's a person who can
see di-swords...!

318
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:18,041
Apparently, you're one too!

319
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,875
I'm a gigalomaniac?

320
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:21,958
Hey, Sena, you're on your
way to buy popsicles

321
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:24,041
at the corner store,
aren't you?

322
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:25,750
Uh... well, yeah, but...

323
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:27,000
Awesome...!
That's perfect,

324
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:29,666
we can all go there together!

325
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,125
My company's made
great strides

326
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:33,375
with the second-generation
Noah II...

327
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:35,375
It is now possible to show
people artificial images

328
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:36,750
in their minds.

329
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:38,583
Is it something
like a hologram?

330
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:41,166
Or perhaps a collective
hallucination?

331
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,541
It's much closer to
a hallucination...

332
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:46,208
but there is one major
difference of course.

333
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:49,041
The artificial images have a
tangible sense of presence

334
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:52,041
and therefore are perceived
as being part of reality.

335
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:53,708
What's this?
Did something happen?

336
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:55,083
I don't understand,

337
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:57,000
what's causing these
people to panic?

338
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:59,625
They're panicking
because they can see it.

339
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,458
See what...? What is it?

340
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:03,375
A runaway excavator.

341
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:05,333
A runaway excavator...?

342
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:07,791
Created by Noah II?

343
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:10,291
The artificial images
created by Noah II

344
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:12,666
were converted to
optical nerve impulses

345
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:15,333
and radiated as
electromagnetic waves.

346
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:17,791
They pass through the skin
and penetrate the skull

347
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:19,541
where they are caught by
dopamine receptors

348
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:21,208
inside the brain.

349
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:23,000
The final process is
pushing the images

350
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:25,750
to unused portions
of the mind.

351
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:28,208
This is the mechanism for
creating something

352
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:30,958
from nothing within human
vision and perception.

353
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:32,583
So in effect,
it now rivals

354
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:34,958
the abilities of the
gigalomaniacs?

355
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:36,666
Yes that's the
whole point...

356
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:39,458
Basically, the Noah II is
an artificial gigalomaniac

357
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:41,541
over which we have
complete control.

358
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,291
What about the
coverage area?

359
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:46,375
How accurately can you focus
the output of these waves?

360
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:48,083
We are not interested
in indiscriminately

361
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:49,958
brainwashing everybody.

362
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:51,458
There's no need
to worry...

363
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:54,666
I've prepared variable
factors for that very reason.

364
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,000
Who are these ruffians?

365
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:57,375
What do they have to
do with all of this?

366
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:59,708
My company is calling
them porters...

367
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:01,916
Put another way, you
might think of them

368
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,583
as a mind control team,

369
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:05,541
assisting in
managing targets...

370
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,833
Each porter has a mechanism
in their backpack

371
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:11,583
designed to be a transceiver for
images created by Noah II.

372
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:13,666
When any of these units
receives a signal,

373
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:17,208
they automatically broadcast it
to their surrounding area.

374
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:19,583
I see, so they're
mobile terminals.

375
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:21,125
If that's the case then
there would be virtually

376
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:23,166
no limit to their
effective range, correct?

377
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,541
And, with an
army of porters,

378
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:27,041
limited use becomes
a nonissue as well.

379
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:29,541
Well...? Tell me...

380
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:31,291
Why are you with this guy?

381
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:32,916
Takumi was in trouble,
bad guys were after him

382
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,166
and he needed help.

383
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,791
So I stepped in and
delivered some justice!

384
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:38,541
Your di-sword,
did you use it?

385
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:40,166
You bet I did...

386
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,666
Take that...! Bam...!
And that...!

387
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:47,291
I told you not to do anything
stupid, didn't I?

388
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:48,916
I'm sorry.

389
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,916
I don't mean the popsicle.

390
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,375
Just be more careful.

391
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:53,750
Huh? Thank you.

392
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:55,166
I still don't
understand exactly

393
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,750
what happened with those
guys back there...?

394
00:17:57,833 --> 00:17:59,458
Did Kozzy save me...?

395
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:01,958
Or was it... me?

396
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:03,625
Listen... Sena
knows everything.

397
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,041
Just ask her...!

398
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,583
She was the first one to tell
me about the di-sword...

399
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:09,666
And also real
bolting...!

400
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:12,500
Or was it... real bot...?
Real boom?

401
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:13,916
It's real-boot.

402
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,166
Yeah, that's it!

403
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,458
What's real-boot?

404
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:18,291
If a di-sword isn't
real-booted,

405
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:21,083
then technically no one should
be able to see it...

406
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:24,833
But Sena could...! Oh I
was so excited about it...

407
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:27,916
I asked her why and she said
we're both gigalomaniacs.

408
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,958
So... what is a gigalomaniac?

409
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,500
Whoa... What is that? !

410
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:38,791
It's a monster excavator!

411
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:40,083
No this can't be real-

412
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:45,166
It's one of their experiments!

413
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,208
Oh no!

414
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,708
You... Stay right there!

415
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:49,416
Huh?

416
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,125
Gigalomaniacs are those with
the power to interfere-

417
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:55,041
To disrupt the
flow of the Dirac Sea.

418
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:57,375
The Dirac Sea...?
Wait a second,

419
00:18:57,458 --> 00:18:59,041
I think I've read
about that online...

420
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:00,583
It's an
unobservable vacuum

421
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:02,666
filled with negative
energy, right?

422
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:13,250
The essential function of
a di-sword is to serve

423
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:16,083
as a shortcut to real-booting
something into existence!

424
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:20,458
When you widen the gap
between the di-sword

425
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:22,708
and the vacuum of
negative energy,

426
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:24,833
according to the hole theory
of the Dirac equation,

427
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:26,166
formations occur...

428
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,500
A particle and
an antiparticle.

429
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:30,000
These particles...

430
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:31,583
They're the
delusional errors

431
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:33,125
created by gigalomaniacs...

432
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:35,250
To make the error a
part of reality,

433
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:37,125
all you have to do is
transmit that information

434
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:40,041
to a dead spot in
someone's mind.

435
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:42,250
There it's converted to
an electrical signal...

436
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:44,916
and it's jointly acknowledged
by those in the vicinity...

437
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,083
In other words...

438
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:47,708
the error becomes real.

439
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:50,916
These two young girls,

440
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,541
are we sure they're
gigalomaniacs?

441
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:54,250
It would appear so.

442
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:56,083
Well, well, well.

443
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:10,208
I don't understand...

444
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:12,250
Who are they
fighting against?

445
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:14,541
What does the popsicle in
your hand look like...?

446
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:15,750
Describe it.

447
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:17,333
Well... It's just a...

448
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:19,250
It's an ordinary
blue popsicle.

449
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:21,208
But is it part
of reality...?

450
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:23,541
How can you prove that
it actually exists?

451
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:25,083
Huh?

452
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:26,208
You accept that
what you're seeing

453
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:28,125
and holding is a
blue popsicle...

454
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:30,791
But only 'cause your
brain recognizes it.

455
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:33,375
What if it were possible
for your brain to lie to you,

456
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:35,666
or trick you into seeing
something that isn't there...?

457
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,083
Consider the possibility

458
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:39,500
that your brain is creating
a delusion of a popsicle

459
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:41,250
that only you
believe exists.

460
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:43,291
But I don't understand,
then how can you ever know

461
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:45,000
if something's
real or not?

462
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:46,750
If more than one
individual sees

463
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:48,083
what you're holding
in your hand

464
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:50,208
and confirms it is
indeed a blue popsicle,

465
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:52,208
it becomes a part of the
collective awareness

466
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:54,333
and you know
that it exists.

467
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:56,458
This is how you
create your reality...

468
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:58,250
To make a delusion
into reality,

469
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:01,166
you simply need to run
this process in reverse.

470
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:04,458
So in other words, if you
were to create a delusion,

471
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:06,375
then use the particles
form the di-sword

472
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:08,166
to force other
people to see it,

473
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,916
it would enter the
collective awareness

474
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,541
and become a part
of reality?

475
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,583
I am so confused...!

476
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:15,958
Only thing I
know for sure

477
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:18,333
is that normal people
can't see this sword.

478
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:20,791
No, Kozzy, don't!

479
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:23,791
Don't worry, they
don't feel a thing! See?

480
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:25,041
Oh I see...

481
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:27,083
The sword doesn't
have physical matter.

482
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:28,416
Bingo, Takumi...!

483
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,666
My di-sword isn't real,

484
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:32,125
it's just my delusion!

485
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:33,791
Right now, that sword's
nothing more

486
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:36,041
than an imagined
error Kozue created...

487
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:37,208
Since there's no
shared awareness

488
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:38,333
with the people
around her,

489
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:39,500
the sword doesn't exist.

490
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:40,916
But if I real-boot it,

491
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,291
then everybody would be
able to see it, right, Sena?

492
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:44,708
I think I understand...

493
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:46,333
Real-booting is the
process of sending

494
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:48,916
the particle to a dead spot
inside a person's mind,

495
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,291
-isn't it?
-You got it...

496
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:51,791
And when that
happens, you can

497
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:54,125
"wham", "bam", "pow" like I did!

498
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:55,333
But wait...

499
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:57,416
Is it possible I might
have that power too?

500
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,916
Don't worry, you'll get
your sword. I know it!

501
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,375
Yeah, but how?

502
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:03,041
Well... Now that
you mention it,

503
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:05,250
I'm not exactly sure
how that works.

504
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:08,500
When there's a big
spike in biorhythms...

505
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:10,083
excessive amounts
of dopamine

506
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:12,875
are secreted inside the neurons
of the mesolimbic pathway...

507
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:14,750
and your di-sword appears.

508
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,375
It could happen when
you're in grave danger...

509
00:22:16,458 --> 00:22:17,791
or angry...

510
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:19,583
or happy or sad...

511
00:22:19,666 --> 00:22:21,000
Everyone's different...

512
00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:22,708
The more dopamine
involved...

513
00:22:22,791 --> 00:22:24,958
the easier it
is to observe.

514
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:27,833
See, I told you
Sena was brilliant!

515
00:22:27,916 --> 00:22:30,250
When I'm in grave
danger, huh?

516
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:35,125
It's too dangerous to
let those girls run free.

517
00:22:35,208 --> 00:22:36,416
We have to stop them.

518
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,875
If we don't do
something immediately,

519
00:22:37,958 --> 00:22:39,666
they could become
a real problem.

520
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,625
Gentlemen, relax...

521
00:22:41,708 --> 00:22:42,916
Leave that issue to me,

522
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,708
just like you did
with the samples.

523
00:22:44,791 --> 00:22:46,500
Well, you have
three codes already

524
00:22:46,583 --> 00:22:48,125
and you still haven't
reached the target yet...

525
00:22:48,208 --> 00:22:49,708
What exactly is
the issue here,

526
00:22:49,791 --> 00:22:51,458
how many more will we need?

527
00:22:51,541 --> 00:22:53,291
It'll be impossible
to reach those numbers

528
00:22:53,375 --> 00:22:56,333
without code samples from at
least five more subjects.

529
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:58,458
My people are already
working on it.

530
00:22:58,541 --> 00:22:59,708
Then we leave
everything to you...

531
00:22:59,791 --> 00:23:01,000
Move forward with the plan

532
00:23:01,083 --> 00:23:02,958
and keep us informed
of your progress.

533
00:23:03,041 --> 00:23:04,833
May the divine
light prevail...

534
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:06,958
It is important that we
all be extremely cautious

535
00:23:07,041 --> 00:23:08,375
from here on out.

536
00:23:08,458 --> 00:23:10,750
Of course... I'll
be very careful...

537
00:23:10,833 --> 00:23:12,333
Everything we do is
for the sake of our

538
00:23:12,416 --> 00:23:14,791
unified ideals, is it not?

539
00:23:18,041 --> 00:23:19,166
With every day
that passes,

540
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:21,375
their experiments get
more out of control.

541
00:23:21,458 --> 00:23:23,666
So that thing they're
making is almost finished?

542
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:25,708
We're going to carry
out our plan soon.

543
00:23:25,791 --> 00:23:27,083
Yes, sir!

544
00:23:27,166 --> 00:23:29,833
I don't get it, what
are they talking about?

545
00:23:29,916 --> 00:23:31,583
Your name... What is it?

546
00:23:31,666 --> 00:23:33,541
Uh... My name's
Takumi Nishijo.

547
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:34,958
Listen up...

548
00:23:35,041 --> 00:23:37,666
You real-booted without a
di-sword, Takumi Nishijo...

549
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:40,500
Until you, no one's been
able to do that before...

550
00:23:40,583 --> 00:23:42,166
Which means you're
not normal...

551
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:43,458
And I wouldn't
be surprised

552
00:23:43,541 --> 00:23:45,000
if they're
targeting you too.

553
00:23:45,083 --> 00:23:46,916
But... Tell me... Why?

554
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,333
There are people who
are trying to use

555
00:23:48,416 --> 00:23:50,666
the power of the
gigalomaniacs for evil.

556
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,541
Yes... But who?

557
00:23:52,625 --> 00:23:54,166
Nozomi Technology.

558
00:23:56,125 --> 00:23:58,333
Are you talking about
the Nozomi Group?

559
00:23:58,416 --> 00:23:59,500
Yes...

560
00:23:59,583 --> 00:24:00,958
They're very powerful...

561
00:24:01,041 --> 00:24:02,166
They have many branches
that carry out

562
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:04,583
business licensed by
the government...

563
00:24:04,666 --> 00:24:05,791
They're doing research

564
00:24:05,875 --> 00:24:07,791
and development for
sinister reasons.

565
00:24:07,875 --> 00:24:10,166
They plan to use a device
called the Noah II

566
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:12,666
to artificially create the
power of gigalomaniacs

567
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:15,291
and ultimately to
alter reality.

568
00:24:15,375 --> 00:24:17,083
Remember the earthquake
from the other day?

569
00:24:17,166 --> 00:24:19,541
It was caused by a
Noah II experiment.

570
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:20,916
Uh, Kozzy...?

571
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,916
Are you sure she's not
having a delusion?

572
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,916
No it's true...! And Sena
and I are going to stop them...

573
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,416
We'll take down
the Nozomi Group

574
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,166
and teach them a lesson!

575
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:31,000
Our only option
is to destroy the

576
00:24:31,083 --> 00:24:33,166
Nozomi Corporation
once and for all.

577
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:34,416
I've got a great idea!

578
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,125
What if Taku
comes with us?

579
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:37,500
No I shouldn't-

580
00:24:37,583 --> 00:24:38,708
Sure you should!

581
00:24:38,791 --> 00:24:40,833
Now we're the
gigalomaniac trio!

582
00:24:40,916 --> 00:24:42,416
-Hold on.
-Ooh...!

583
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:45,125
We should go take a
picture together to celebrate!

584
00:24:45,208 --> 00:24:47,000
Perfect... Let's go!

585
00:24:49,166 --> 00:24:50,375
Takumi... You
stand in the middle!

586
00:24:50,458 --> 00:24:51,541
But I don't want to-

587
00:24:51,625 --> 00:24:53,750
Come on, get in
there, guys. Hurry, go!

588
00:24:53,833 --> 00:24:55,208
I don't do this stuff-

589
00:24:55,291 --> 00:24:57,125
I know, it's my first
time, too. I'm so excited!

590
00:24:58,291 --> 00:24:59,666
Okay! Say cheese!

591
00:25:07,291 --> 00:25:12,250
[Music]

592
00:26:43,416 --> 00:26:45,291
Those eyes... Whose are they?
