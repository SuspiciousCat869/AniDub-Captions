[Music]

2
00:01:38,958 --> 00:01:41,083
I'm Takumi Nishijo...

3
00:01:41,166 --> 00:01:43,708
Apparently I know the girl I
saw at the murder scene...

4
00:01:43,791 --> 00:01:45,458
Her name is Rimi

5
00:01:45,541 --> 00:01:47,958
and we go to school together
at the Suimei Academy...

6
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:49,291
And according to her,

7
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:51,666
we've been good friends
for a while now.

8
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,083
The only thing is,

9
00:01:53,166 --> 00:01:55,500
I don't have any
memories of her at all.

10
00:01:56,791 --> 00:02:00,291
Meanwhile... I started to fall
for this girl Yua Kusunoki,

11
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:02,583
an upper classman
at our school...

12
00:02:02,666 --> 00:02:04,708
Turns out Yua was
investigating me

13
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,958
because she believed I
was the New Gen murderer.

14
00:02:08,125 --> 00:02:09,375
That's not all...

15
00:02:09,458 --> 00:02:11,833
She said I was sending
messages to myself...

16
00:02:11,916 --> 00:02:14,416
Called it my one-man show.

17
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,750
This girl...

18
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:17,500
She thinks that
I'm the General.

19
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:26,416
The day before
my field trip...

20
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,083
my parents told me...

21
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:31,041
"I'm so sorry Takumi
but you can't go."...

22
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:33,541
I had been looking forward
to that trip for a week.

23
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:37,916
I was so angry I couldn't
even think straight...

24
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
"I hope nobody
is able to go"...

25
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:41,916
"I hope nobody
is able to go,"

26
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,250
I thought to myself.

27
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:54,458
Takumi-Something
horrible has happened!

28
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:03,416
The local news channel
reported on the incident...

29
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,250
The images on the
TV were identical

30
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:08,208
to what I had
seen in my mind.

31
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:10,833
I began to believe that
my wish had come true,

32
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:12,625
and my thoughts had
changed reality.

33
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:17,708
I can't believe this...!

34
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:19,375
Thank goodness you
stayed home...

35
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:22,875
I don't know what I'd
do if I'd lost you...

36
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:25,958
Oh Taku... we're so blessed!

37
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:27,541
"Blessed", huh...?

38
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:28,666
I wasn't so sure.

39
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:32,958
Taku?

40
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:35,375
I started to feel
uncomfortable.

41
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:36,958
I stopped talking to people

42
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:38,708
and began to isolate myself.

43
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:42,708
Eventually, my mom
got really worried

44
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:45,208
because of my
unusual behavior...

45
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:47,791
So she took me to the
hospital for a diagnosis.

46
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:57,500
Nothing has changed.

47
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:01,083
Takumi, look.

48
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:03,666
This hospital doesn't
just treat sick people.

49
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,500
We also treat
mental disorders.

50
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:10,125
If I let that
doc diagnose me...

51
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,708
Mister Nishijo...
Takumi Nishijo,

52
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:14,500
please come to the
diagnosis room.

53
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:18,333
Hello there...

54
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:19,291
What's your name?

55
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:21,291
It's Takumi. Remember?

56
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,291
Nishijo.

57
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:24,375
Right...

58
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:25,375
Call me Doc.

59
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:27,375
Nice to meet you.

60
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:30,083
Doctor Takashina
doesn't remember me?

61
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:31,875
It says here you're
trying to determine

62
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:33,791
if you have a
sleepwalking disorder...

63
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:34,958
Did something happen?

64
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,666
Um, well, I...

65
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:37,958
I don't know, could
it be possible

66
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:40,458
to walk around
without realizing?

67
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:43,416
Or maybe to type something
extensive on your computer

68
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,125
and not have any
recollection of doing it...?

69
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:47,500
Does that happen?

70
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:49,291
Perhaps.

71
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:52,041
You see, someone I know
told me I had done that...

72
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,625
Now I'm really confused.

73
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:54,708
Mr. Nishijo,

74
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:56,166
do you think it's possible

75
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,541
this person might be trying
to pull a prank on you?

76
00:04:58,625 --> 00:04:59,916
Well I don't know.

77
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,916
Did this person actually
see you walking around

78
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,291
while you were
unconscious,

79
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:06,750
doing all these
unusual things?

80
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:09,750
Okay... So you don't really
know if it's true or not.

81
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,125
What worries me

82
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:13,333
is she's sort of like
some kind of detective...

83
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:15,458
And to convince me she
showed me a lot of evidence.

84
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:16,791
I see...

85
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:18,666
Before these alleged
incidents occurred,

86
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,000
had you shown symptoms
of sleepwalking?

87
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:22,375
No.

88
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:24,208
So prior to this
person telling you,

89
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:26,416
you had no idea that you might
have this problem, correct?

90
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:28,333
But I...

91
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:29,708
I just...

92
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:32,291
I... I haven't
been sleeping well.

93
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:33,958
Are you afraid...?

94
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:36,291
There's really no reason
for you to be concerned.

95
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:37,583
No that's not...

96
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:39,583
You see I...

97
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:40,916
This isn't right...

98
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,625
This isn't what I wanted
to talk about at all...

99
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:45,250
-Hazuki.
-Yes?

100
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:48,750
I haven't been sleeping.

101
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:50,125
I haven't been sleeping,

102
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:52,583
but I've been doing things
I don't remember doing!

103
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:54,291
Thank you.

104
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:56,333
There are several different
ways for us to determine

105
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:58,666
whether or not you
have this disorder...

106
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,166
My recommendation is that you
spend the night at the hospital

107
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,333
and allow us to monitor
your behavior...

108
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:05,208
It is possible your
symptoms won't appear

109
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:07,500
if you're not in a
familiar environment...

110
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:10,000
But I suppose there's only
one way to find out...

111
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:11,250
What do you think...?

112
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:12,708
Would you like to
stay overnight?

113
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,166
Uh, Mr. Nishijo...?

114
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,375
Mr. Nishijo?

115
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:22,625
I'll wake you up in
about three hours, okay?

116
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:23,875
Don't you worry
about a thing,

117
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:25,208
you're in good hands here,

118
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:26,875
I'll take
excellent care of you.

119
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:30,125
Just relax, sleep tight!

120
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:45,791
Takki.

121
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:47,583
Wake up, sleepy head.

122
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:50,208
Seira baby, whoa!

123
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:52,666
You're really wearing
a nurse outfit!

124
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,708
Hey... You be quiet.

125
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:57,208
We don't want a real nurse
interrupting us, am I right?

126
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:01,625
Takki, listen to me,
you do not sleepwalk...

127
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:04,291
And I would know because I
watch you sleep every night...

128
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:05,750
So don't worry
about a thing!

129
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:07,291
Oh, Seira.

130
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:10,083
Why are you bothering with
those stupid 3D girls, huh...?

131
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:12,750
I thought I was the
only woman for you?

132
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,666
No, Seira, you're the one.

133
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,875
I only have eyes
for you, babe...

134
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:19,041
My one and only true love.

135
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:23,166
Rise and shine!

136
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:27,166
So tell me how you're
feeling, Mr. Nishijo.

137
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:32,541
Well you slept like a
baby for over three hours.

138
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:34,250
Oh... Seira babe.

139
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:42,375
You showed no signs of a
sleepwalking condition.

140
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:43,750
Of course, as the
doctor mentioned,

141
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:45,333
it's entirely possible

142
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:47,500
that the symptoms just
didn't appear this time,

143
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:48,833
so we can't say
whether or not

144
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:51,416
you have the
disorder just yet.

145
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,083
'Scuse me...

146
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:55,375
Could I possibly
speak with the doctor?

147
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:56,666
There's no need.

148
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,666
Just keep an eye on it
for the next week or so

149
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,625
and if anything happens
come back and see us.

150
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,916
Then the shadow
of a large man

151
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,791
slowly crept up on the beautiful
unsuspecting little girl,

152
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:10,500
and the next thing you know,

153
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:12,333
his fangs glowed in the
moonlight, just like this!

154
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:17,708
No...! I'm scared, please
don't talk about that!

155
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:19,750
Oh come on, that story
wouldn't scare a baby,

156
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:20,625
what's the big deal?!

157
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:21,833
Please just stop,

158
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:23,458
I can't take it anymore!

159
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:24,625
What a wimp.

160
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:26,000
She can't handle scary
stories, can she?

161
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:28,166
Yeah, she's too sensitive.

162
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,166
Hey, listen up, ladies...!

163
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,625
Mr. Vannabe Classics Teacher
needs some help,

164
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:33,458
so what's the deal?

165
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:34,666
Who's on duty today?

166
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,791
Huh...? Oh... Me!

167
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:57,125
Oh... Thank you.

168
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:11,083
Wow, what a myth maniac.

169
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:12,291
I don't understand people

170
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:14,458
who read those kinds
of books all the time.

171
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:16,541
I wonder what goes
through their heads?

172
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:20,625
Thanks again.

173
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:36,458
The Devil King Gladiale
will bring destruction...

174
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:38,708
And chaos...

175
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:40,458
The time is near...

176
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:41,625
He is coming.

177
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:55,125
Don't you get it?
You own both profiles.

178
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:58,333
You showed no symptoms of
a sleepwalking disorder.

179
00:09:58,416 --> 00:10:00,291
After everything,
I still have no idea

180
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:02,958
whether Yua's
theory is true...

181
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:04,333
I can't believe I
could've done those things

182
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:05,416
while I was sleeping

183
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,208
and then have no
memory of doing them,

184
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:08,875
that just doesn't
make any sense...

185
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:10,125
She's gotta be making it up,

186
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:12,250
that picture must be a phony.

187
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:14,375
Then all you have to
do now is find proof

188
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:17,083
that it was a Photoshopped
image, right, Takki?

189
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:19,541
Whaddaya say? Let's
analyze the evidence.

190
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:21,625
I don't know, that
picture's hard to look at.

191
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:23,458
Oh, come on, it'll
be totally worth it.

192
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:25,375
If you can disprove that
crazy woman's theory,

193
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,333
then you don't have to be
afraid anymore, right...?

194
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:29,125
Then you'll be
normal again!

195
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:30,125
You're right...

196
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:31,791
Who does she think she is?

197
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:33,708
I won't let her blame
this mess on me!

198
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:38,125
You hang in there, Takki!

199
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:40,000
Right.

200
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:49,916
Look... It's a person!

201
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,708
Who is it?

202
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:52,916
Let's see.

203
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:01,583
Takki...

204
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:03,750
What's wrong?

205
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:05,916
What is this?

206
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,125
That can't be!

207
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,416
Takki, that's you!

208
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:13,625
There's no way
this is real...

209
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:14,958
It's not...!

210
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,625
I'd never even stepped
foot in that place

211
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:17,958
before September 29th,

212
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:20,083
so how could that be
me in the photograph?

213
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:21,416
The General sent
this image to you

214
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,083
on the 28th of September,

215
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:25,625
one day before the
murder occurred, right?

216
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:27,000
But the staking incident

217
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:28,458
happened on the
29th of September

218
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:29,916
and if that's
true that means...

219
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,500
It means at the
time it was sent,

220
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:33,250
this was a picture of
something that hadn't happened,

221
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:35,333
of something to come...

222
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:38,000
So this photograph
predicted the future.

223
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:40,416
Are you a clairvoyant,
can you predict the future?

224
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,458
No, I can't!

225
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:44,666
The file was
created on the 28th.

226
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:49,833
Those eyes...

227
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:51,083
Whose are they?

228
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:56,375
Ever since I was
a young boy...

229
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:58,541
I've always felt like
someone was watching me,

230
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:00,666
every moment.

231
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,375
It never went away...

232
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:04,666
It got to the point where
I even thought that God

233
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,125
might be watching me...

234
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:07,958
I honestly believed that.

235
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:36,916
D-I-D...?

236
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,666
Dissociative Identity Disorder

237
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:41,500
is when a single person has
multiple personalities.

238
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:53,458
You're in pain...

239
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:54,875
Takumi.

240
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:57,750
But...

241
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:01,750
But I...

242
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,583
I just...

243
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:08,916
Clairvoyance...

244
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,416
Clairvoyance...

245
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,375
Clairvoyance.

246
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:15,541
The future.

247
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:17,541
Clairvoyance.

248
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:20,875
Damn it... There's no
conclusive scientific evidence.

249
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:22,666
Well if that's the case...

250
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,916
get online and research
supernatural stuff,

251
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,958
see what you find.

252
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:27,291
Of course...

253
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:28,875
Baby, you are so smart.

254
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,875
Fortune telling.

255
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:38,291
Phantasm?

256
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:39,500
FES?

257
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:45,458
Phantasm is a four-person
gothic punk group

258
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:49,208
that plays sold out concerts
all over the city of Shibuya.

259
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:50,625
They have become
quite popular

260
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:52,041
on the independent rock scene

261
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:54,666
and have received much
attention... just this year.

262
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,083
Their success is
due in large part

263
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:57,708
to a female
vocalist called FES.

264
00:13:57,791 --> 00:13:59,000
What the heck...?

265
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:01,000
So this FES person
is the lead singer,

266
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:02,500
what does that have
to do with anything?

267
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:03,750
I don't know,

268
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:06,416
how could that relate
to seeing the future?

269
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,166
The New Gen prediction...?

270
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,166
Is this it?

271
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,333
Crucifixion Mass?

272
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:17,250
And now we see that
Gladiale is here...

273
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:19,208
Making right and wrong
turn to crimson...

274
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:21,125
And the fallen
sheep have gone astray,

275
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:22,833
but he has come
to show the way.

276
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:24,541
The needles then appear
before your eyes.

277
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:26,416
They're piercing through
the skin in shapes,

278
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,000
like crosses cleansing
oh so radiantly.

279
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:30,791
It's our crucifixion.

280
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:32,250
These are the lyrics

281
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:34,625
to what is probably Phantasm's
most popular song...

282
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,083
It's written by FES...

283
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,125
Hold on...

284
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:40,500
What if FES and the demon
girl are the same person?

285
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:44,708
That could explain how FES would
be able to predict the event

286
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:46,375
months before it happened.

287
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:49,166
'Cause she knew exactly
what she was going to do?

288
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,041
Isn't there a
picture of this FES?

289
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:52,166
Let me see.

290
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:55,208
That doesn't
surprise me at all.

291
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:56,708
Seeing as how
she's a criminal,

292
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:59,041
I guess she doesn't let her
pictures get out on the net.

293
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:00,458
Murderers are
always so careful.

294
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:02,083
How annoying!

295
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:03,833
Let's see if they
have a show lined up.

296
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:06,125
It's tomorrow.

297
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:09,000
Takki, can you handle a place
like that by yourself? Why not?

298
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:10,916
Rock concerts are dark,
cramped, and noisy,

299
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,583
not to mention the smell...

300
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:13,625
And... plus...

301
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:15,041
Plus what?

302
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:16,833
Everyone there
will be in 3D.

303
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:25,083
Taku!

304
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,916
Here's the CD, buddy.

305
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,458
I bought one for
myself, too...

306
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:32,750
I'm sorry I had to
borrow some cash...

307
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:35,125
Man, Phantasm is
totally awesome...

308
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:37,458
I'm having a blast...!

309
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:39,625
Just hearing them live today,
I'm already a fan!

310
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:42,500
But... About the singer.

311
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:43,500
Oh yeah...

312
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:45,375
This chick is
totally hot, dude.

313
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:48,333
Who knew you had
such good taste, man.

314
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:51,291
Wait, I thought FES
was the demon girl?

315
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:53,000
But what was she like?

316
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:54,750
You know, if you're so
interested in FES,

317
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:56,958
you don't just have to
take my word for it...

318
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:57,791
Come in and see
for yourself!

319
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:59,416
No, no don't!

320
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,708
Forget about Rimi
for just one night...

321
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:02,916
But I... I... I gotta...

322
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,750
And I'll forget about
my girlfriend, too.

323
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:06,833
The sword will
lead the way.

324
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:11,833
And reveal the
doorway for you.

325
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:14,250
There's no one else
who can compare.

326
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:18,041
Without you,
I lose all control.

327
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:23,666
You are the one.

328
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,458
That's her...? FES?

329
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:26,875
Yeah!

330
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:51,083
My friends...

331
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:54,166
I feel better today
than I have lately.

332
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,541
My voice sounds crisp...

333
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:58,916
The world seems calm... clear.

334
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:04,208
Maybe it's because the gate
to Cocytus is closed now...

335
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:06,166
The equilibrium of this
world was maintained

336
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,875
for thousands of years

337
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:09,750
after the Great Will
came to be.

338
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,000
But now, my friends,

339
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:14,750
that harmony's
being threatened...

340
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,041
It has become unstable.

341
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,666
And that is why I sing.

342
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:24,166
I will take your chaos...

343
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,833
And purify it.

344
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:39,791
Is that a microphone stand...?

345
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:41,833
It looks exactly
like a sword.

346
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:47,041
And now...

347
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:48,083
The crucifixion.

348
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:57,625
The light is
slowly dying out

349
00:17:57,708 --> 00:18:00,583
I know the candle's fading

350
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:03,416
The long- awaited
time has come

351
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,250
Crucifixion's
here to save us

352
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:09,375
The blood begins to pour

353
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:12,291
We feel the sting
of cleansing pain

354
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:13,916
The lights go out...

355
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,125
see them one by one,
they fade away

356
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:21,333
Can you feel the
blessing on you now?

357
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:24,333
Just let it run through
you, feel its power

358
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:26,708
The child of God
is present here

359
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:29,041
Here... he's here...
so beware...

360
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:30,416
the end's near

361
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,541
And now we see that
Gladiale is here

362
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:36,708
Making right and
wrong turn to crimson

363
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:39,208
And the fallen sheep
have gone astray

364
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:42,208
but he has come...
to show the way

365
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:45,125
The needles that appear
before your eyes

366
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:48,458
They're piercing through the
skin in shapes like crosses

367
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:51,375
Cleansing oh so radiantly

368
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:53,583
You'll find us

369
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:58,541
It's our crucifixion

370
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:07,375
She's looking at me.

371
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:49,125
Hey, what's wrong?

372
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:03,541
Those eyes,
whose are they?

373
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:22,625
She said it...

374
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:23,958
I heard her...

375
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:25,875
How does she know
that phrase...?

376
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,666
Maybe she works for
the demon girl...?

377
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:28,833
I don't know.

378
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:32,166
I will never
come back here!

379
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:48,333
Hey, Kozue...

380
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:49,458
have you finished packing?

381
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:50,916
It's almost time to go.

382
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:55,875
I guess it's time for us to
say goodbye to this house.

383
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:59,416
This is the first time you've
been back to Tokyo, isn't it...?

384
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,833
Don't worry, you'll
make some new friends.

385
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:13,666
Hey look...!

386
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,541
Are you paying attention?

387
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:17,250
I think I found a
winner with this one.

388
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:18,625
The color's pretty cute.
Don't you think?

389
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:20,083
Geez... Get whatever you want.

390
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:21,291
Yeah, but on second thought,

391
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:22,791
it might not be a good fit.

392
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:24,625
It could be a little
too girly for you.

393
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:35,458
I can't believe someone
would walk around

394
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:38,833
with a huge toy sword in the
middle of Shibuya like that...

395
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:40,250
And I thought I was a nerd.

396
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:41,083
You jerk!

397
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:46,625
Why'd you run
away from me?

398
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:47,916
Look, I'm sorry

399
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,458
I'm taking a long time to
decide and everything,

400
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:51,125
but this is kind of
important...!

401
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:53,750
It's just downright mean to
abandon your poor little sister

402
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:55,500
without so much as a word!

403
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:56,583
Uh, no I just...

404
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:57,708
Stupid brother...!

405
00:21:57,791 --> 00:21:59,333
How can you be so
incredibly mean to me

406
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:02,250
when I love you this much...?!

407
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:05,250
-I hope you get gastritis!
-Where'd that come from?

408
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:06,750
Fine, you're getting
the same model as me

409
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:08,291
and I don't care
what you say...!

410
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:10,750
We are going to sign the
contract today, got it...?

411
00:22:10,833 --> 00:22:12,916
And you're not going
anywhere until you do!

412
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:13,625
Fine just relax...

413
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:15,750
Hey!

414
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:17,708
Man... this is more embarrassing
than walking around

415
00:22:17,791 --> 00:22:19,333
with a toy sword...

416
00:22:19,416 --> 00:22:20,541
Hey!

417
00:22:25,166 --> 00:22:26,375
I know if you take
that phone home

418
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:27,750
you're just going
to ignore it,

419
00:22:27,833 --> 00:22:29,791
so being the good
sister that I am,

420
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:32,583
I am going to make sure you
know exactly how to use it...

421
00:22:32,666 --> 00:22:34,750
Ah, and look
what I got you!

422
00:22:34,833 --> 00:22:36,666
Ta-dah...! Remember this?

423
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:38,333
It's Hoppy, your
favorite frog!

424
00:22:38,416 --> 00:22:40,166
Huh?

425
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:41,833
You see, every other Friday

426
00:22:41,916 --> 00:22:44,458
they release a new and improved
version of Mister Hoppy...

427
00:22:44,541 --> 00:22:47,416
You have to stand in line
for a long time to get one.

428
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,583
People line up for that?

429
00:22:49,666 --> 00:22:51,250
Well, because I'm so nice,

430
00:22:51,333 --> 00:22:52,791
I bought an extra one
for your cell phone.

431
00:22:52,875 --> 00:22:54,416
No thanks!

432
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:57,041
But I already put
it on there...!

433
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:58,250
It's weird...

434
00:22:58,333 --> 00:23:00,958
We haven't hung out in
a long time, huh...?

435
00:23:01,041 --> 00:23:03,000
I don't think I can
remember the last time

436
00:23:03,083 --> 00:23:05,666
the two of us went shopping
together, can you, Taku...?

437
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,541
After all, you're always
at home like a hermit,

438
00:23:07,625 --> 00:23:10,000
playing your video games
and watching anime.

439
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:13,625
I think outings like this are
sort of nice, don't you...?

440
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:15,416
Now and then...?

441
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,583
Though it would be boring if
we had to do it every day.

442
00:23:19,708 --> 00:23:21,416
You know those things
will make you fat.

443
00:23:23,375 --> 00:23:24,625
You want half of this?

444
00:23:24,708 --> 00:23:25,625
Have at it.

445
00:23:27,416 --> 00:23:29,291
If I were you, I would
try to keep in mind

446
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:30,791
that saying things
like that to females

447
00:23:30,875 --> 00:23:32,125
will make them hate you!

448
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:40,166
That was a colossal
waste of time.

449
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:42,166
I'm gonna get home and
play my video game.

450
00:23:51,958 --> 00:23:53,083
It's Grim.

451
00:23:57,916 --> 00:23:59,166
What does he mean?

452
00:24:00,291 --> 00:24:03,041
The fourth incident
has occurred?

453
00:24:03,125 --> 00:24:04,625
His skin turned green...?

454
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,708
All of the blood
was sucked out?

455
00:24:07,791 --> 00:24:09,458
How does he know
so much about it?

456
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:17,916
Net auction?

457
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:22,791
They're photos of the
fourth New Gen incident...

458
00:24:22,875 --> 00:24:24,083
They were put
up for auction

459
00:24:24,166 --> 00:24:26,333
just like any other
normal thing...

460
00:24:26,416 --> 00:24:27,833
Hold on...

461
00:24:27,916 --> 00:24:29,375
That means the person
who provided these

462
00:24:29,458 --> 00:24:31,083
is the New Gen criminal...

463
00:24:31,166 --> 00:24:32,708
The name of the killer is...

464
00:24:32,791 --> 00:24:33,833
Vampire.

465
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:37,666
Who's the Vampire?

466
00:24:54,625 --> 00:24:56,041
Those eyes...

467
00:24:56,125 --> 00:24:58,083
Whose are they?

468
00:24:58,166 --> 00:25:00,583
What are those words
doing there...?!

469
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:02,916
What in the hell are
those words doing there?!

470
00:25:07,333 --> 00:25:12,708
[Music]

471
00:26:43,416 --> 00:26:45,208
Those eyes...

472
00:26:45,291 --> 00:26:46,375
Whose are they?
