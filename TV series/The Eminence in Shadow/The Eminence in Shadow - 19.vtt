(crowd awed)

00:00:19.472 --> 00:00:21.944
You took down the commander
with one blow!

00:00:22.044 --> 00:00:23.580
Very impressive, Princess Iris.

00:00:23.681 --> 00:00:27.188
I always knew Her Highness
possessed extraordinary talent.

00:00:27.288 --> 00:00:29.491
You're amazing, Iris.

00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:35.839
[ref] He's out!
The winner is Iris Midgar!

00:00:35.939 --> 00:00:38.511
[students] Congratulations,
Student Council President.

00:00:38.611 --> 00:00:40.649
-You're the pride of the
Royal Bushin method.

00:00:40.749 --> 00:00:43.420
-With Princess Iris,
Midgar will always be safe.

00:00:43.521 --> 00:00:45.992
[commander]
The local citizens can handle
restoring public order

00:00:46.092 --> 00:00:47.629
in those remote regions.

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:49.833
There's no reason you
should have to travel

00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:51.570
all the way out there to help.

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.042
After all,
it won't do to take work away

00:00:54.142 --> 00:00:56.379
from the
Dark Knight Association.

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:59.118
There are more important things
for you to be doing.

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.623
Things that only you can
accomplish.

00:01:01.723 --> 00:01:02.993
[citizens] Princess Iris!

00:01:03.093 --> 00:01:05.030
-You finally officially
joined the Knights!

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:06.633
-She cuts such a dashing figure.

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:08.671
-You're the pride of
the Midgar Kingdom.

00:01:08.772 --> 00:01:10.007
-Princess Iris!

00:01:10.107 --> 00:01:12.044
(swoosh)
(air blasting)

00:01:12.144 --> 00:01:14.481
(gentle piano music)

00:01:15.518 --> 00:01:17.455
[Alpha] Why don't you be
a good audience member

00:01:17.556 --> 00:01:19.159
and content yourself
with sitting back

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.493
and enjoying the show?

00:01:20.594 --> 00:01:22.699
So you expect me to do nothing
and just watch?

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.871
Please be reasonable.
If we can't use our magic,

00:01:25.972 --> 00:01:27.943
even you are powerless
against them.

00:01:28.043 --> 00:01:29.947
(gasps)

00:01:30.047 --> 00:01:31.415
I don't understand, Father,

00:01:31.516 --> 00:01:32.484
the Divine Teachings have-

00:01:32.585 --> 00:01:34.288
[Midgar] But you have no proof.

00:01:34.388 --> 00:01:36.827
That's why I need to invoke
your royal authority,

00:01:36.927 --> 00:01:37.963
so I can get proof.

00:01:38.063 --> 00:01:40.467
[Midgar]
Iris, acting impetuously

00:01:40.568 --> 00:01:43.841
will only create more enemies.

00:01:43.941 --> 00:01:45.411
Even if what
you're doing is right,

00:01:45.512 --> 00:01:47.181
there is no guarantee
that those

00:01:47.281 --> 00:01:49.018
who don't know the
circumstances

00:01:49.118 --> 00:01:52.024
will understand
that it is right.

00:01:52.124 --> 00:01:53.326
[Iris] But-
[Midgar] Besides,

00:01:53.427 --> 00:01:55.197
with the Bushin Festival
approaching,

00:01:55.297 --> 00:01:57.334
this is a time
when we must welcome

00:01:57.434 --> 00:01:59.471
many guests from other nations.

00:01:59.573 --> 00:02:01.744
We cannot afford
to present ourselves

00:02:01.844 --> 00:02:04.783
as standing in opposition
to the Divine Teachings.

00:02:04.883 --> 00:02:07.021
[Iris] But we can't just let
them get away with it.

00:02:07.121 --> 00:02:08.289
Listen, Iris,

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:10.260
it sounds like you
are so desperate

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.597
to prove yourself right

00:02:11.697 --> 00:02:13.433
that you are willing
to put the kingdom

00:02:13.534 --> 00:02:15.470
and its people in danger.

00:02:15.571 --> 00:02:16.873
(gasps)

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.313
I'll get results.

00:02:20.413 --> 00:02:23.486
I will prove to them all
that I have the power.

00:02:23.587 --> 00:02:25.423
(swoosh)

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:28.697
(ground crumbling)

00:02:30.367 --> 00:02:33.674
I have the will to triumph.

00:02:34.944 --> 00:02:37.280
(OPENING THEME)

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.467

[Kagenou]
<i>Once you get the hang of it,

00:04:27.468 --> 00:04:29.606
<i>and they'll bring it to you,

00:04:30.206 --> 00:04:31.242
[Iris] Good morning.

00:04:31.342 --> 00:04:33.781
(uh)
Hello, good morning to you.

00:04:33.881 --> 00:04:36.720
Are you here to cheer for
Claire again today?

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:38.590
Yes, I am.

00:04:38.691 --> 00:04:40.193
And you're sitting here
again today.

00:04:40.293 --> 00:04:43.232
That's because I have another
match later on this afternoon.

00:04:43.332 --> 00:04:46.039
So I've been released from
my official duties.

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:48.476
Oh, are you drinking coffee?

00:04:48.577 --> 00:04:51.416
That beverage
they sell at Mitsugoshi?

00:04:51.517 --> 00:04:53.153
I love how it smells,

00:04:53.253 --> 00:04:55.691
but I have trouble
with bitter flavors.

00:04:55.791 --> 00:04:57.762
Have you tried turning it
into coffee milk?

00:04:57.862 --> 00:05:00.534
You just put in
a ton of milk and sugar.

00:05:00.634 --> 00:05:02.104
[Iris] Coffee milk?

00:05:02.204 --> 00:05:04.910
It's a magic spell that will
make every kind of coffee

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:07.214
taste exactly the same.

00:05:07.314 --> 00:05:09.520
(bright playful music)

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:10.921
Magic?

00:05:11.256 --> 00:05:13.392
Uh...

00:05:13.492 --> 00:05:15.396
[both] Umm...
(pouring sounds)

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:17.768
[both] Huh?

00:05:23.246 --> 00:05:25.083
Oh, yummy.

00:05:28.056 --> 00:05:30.929
[Kagenou] <i>Hashtag elegant
breakfast with the princess.</i>

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:34.034
<i>This would totally go viral
on the internet.</i>

00:05:34.134 --> 00:05:35.371
[usher] Miss, your sword?

00:05:35.471 --> 00:05:37.207
[Beatrix] Not allowed?

00:05:37.307 --> 00:05:38.243
[nobles] Who's that?

00:05:38.343 --> 00:05:39.312
-Do you think she's a beggar?

00:05:39.412 --> 00:05:40.682
-What happened to security?

00:05:40.782 --> 00:05:42.184
Isn't that?

00:05:42.284 --> 00:05:43.620
I'm terribly sorry, Miss,

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.858
but I'd like to check your
invitation again if I may.

00:05:45.959 --> 00:05:48.329
[Iris] It's all right.
I invited her.

00:05:48.429 --> 00:05:49.331
[all] Huh?

00:05:49.431 --> 00:05:50.501
[usher] Princess Iris...

00:05:50.602 --> 00:05:52.939
Welcome,
Beatrix the Goddess of War.

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:55.109
[both] Huh?

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:56.646
[nobles]
Beatrix the Goddess of War?

00:05:56.746 --> 00:05:58.818
-The legendary elf sword master?

00:05:58.918 --> 00:05:59.987
-She's beautiful.

00:06:00.087 --> 00:06:01.189
[Iris] Please come with me.

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:02.491
<i>Oh, that's so cool.</i>

00:06:02.592 --> 00:06:04.629
<i>Goddess of War, sword master...</i>

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:06.700
<i>I would absolutely love it
if people said,</i>

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.971
<i>"Isn't he the legendary,"
about me?</i>

00:06:09.071 --> 00:06:11.342
<i>Wait, they're just gonna come
sit right here?</i>

00:06:11.442 --> 00:06:14.549
[noble]
It has been quite a while since
anyone's seen you in public,

00:06:14.649 --> 00:06:16.386
hasn't it, Lady Beatrix?

00:06:16.486 --> 00:06:19.560
Yes, I'm actually looking for
someone, my niece.

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:21.362
She looks very much like me.

00:06:21.463 --> 00:06:23.299
Do you know if anyone
has seen her?

00:06:23.399 --> 00:06:27.240
[Kagenou]
<i>I'm keeping my lips sealed.
Tight as a clam.</i>

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:28.911
[noble]
...ever forget seeing her.

00:06:29.011 --> 00:06:31.382
I've heard that people have
seen elves frequently

00:06:31.482 --> 00:06:32.618
in this kingdom lately.

00:06:32.718 --> 00:06:34.355
[nobles]
Unfortunately, I haven't.

00:06:34.455 --> 00:06:36.760
-I don't recall
seeing her either.

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:37.829
I'm sorry.

00:06:37.929 --> 00:06:39.331
I was sure that
if you asked around here,

00:06:39.432 --> 00:06:41.002
there must be someone
who had heard.

00:06:41.102 --> 00:06:42.539
[Kagenou] <i>Looking around
this might be the most</i>

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:44.441

00:06:44.542 --> 00:06:46.278

00:06:46.378 --> 00:06:47.582
<i>of background characters</i>

00:06:47.682 --> 00:06:49.418
<i>who are surrounding

00:06:49.519 --> 00:06:50.688
<i>I love it.</i>

00:06:50.788 --> 00:06:53.460
There's one.
It's Cid.

00:06:53.561 --> 00:06:55.865
[Iris] Cid?
[nobles] Cid?

00:06:55.965 --> 00:06:57.501
[Beatrix]
Cid has caught my attention.

00:06:57.601 --> 00:06:59.237
I'm sure he will grow stronger.

00:06:59.337 --> 00:07:01.208
No, I won't, that's ridiculous.

00:07:01.308 --> 00:07:02.812
He is a student at the academy,

00:07:02.912 --> 00:07:05.284
but honestly, I don't think
he's knight material.

00:07:05.384 --> 00:07:07.187
He doesn't even come close
to being as good

00:07:07.287 --> 00:07:09.124
as his sister, Claire Kagenou.

00:07:09.224 --> 00:07:12.832
[nobl] Kagenou? You don't mean
the son of that baldy?

00:07:12.932 --> 00:07:16.271
Well, if that is what the
Lady Beatrix believes,

00:07:16.372 --> 00:07:18.511
then I am certain
she must be right.

00:07:18.611 --> 00:07:19.813
Of course, good point.

00:07:19.913 --> 00:07:22.117
We will look forward
to his future.

00:07:22.217 --> 00:07:24.756
[nobles] Is this clueless
woman really the War Goddess?

00:07:24.856 --> 00:07:27.862
-She's Princess Iris'
invited guest, so probably.

00:07:27.962 --> 00:07:29.899
-She doesn't look like
she could fight a cold,

00:07:29.999 --> 00:07:30.668
let alone a person.

00:07:30.768 --> 00:07:32.404
-Shh! They can hear you!

00:07:32.505 --> 00:07:33.774
<i>I see...</i>

00:07:33.874 --> 00:07:35.476
<i>She definitely seems to
have what it takes</i>

00:07:35.577 --> 00:07:37.414
<i>to be called a goddess of war.</i>

00:07:37.515 --> 00:07:40.420
<i>Her looks, her personality, her
title, and even her strength.</i>

00:07:40.521 --> 00:07:43.760
<i>Everything about her is
perfectly natural and
unembellished.</i>

00:07:43.861 --> 00:07:47.100
<i>That's why no one can see
how powerful she really is.</i>

00:07:49.338 --> 00:07:51.175
(Oriana groaning)

00:07:54.783 --> 00:07:57.955
There.
I have no complaints about the
efficacy of this drug,

00:07:58.055 --> 00:08:01.295
but can we stop it from making
him smell so sickeningly sweet?

00:08:01.395 --> 00:08:03.634
Cover it up with
perfume or something.

00:08:03.734 --> 00:08:05.538
As you command my liege.

00:08:05.638 --> 00:08:07.542
[Perv]
All it takes is one little drug

00:08:07.642 --> 00:08:08.844
and you're reduced to a puppet

00:08:08.945 --> 00:08:10.848
that can only do
as you're commanded.

00:08:10.948 --> 00:08:14.421
You really are pathetic.
I truly pity you, Your Majesty.

00:08:14.522 --> 00:08:16.158
But let me reassure you.

00:08:16.258 --> 00:08:18.029
I have no doubt your dear Rose

00:08:18.129 --> 00:08:20.701
will come back to save
her pitiful father.

00:08:20.801 --> 00:08:22.171
(mumbling) Rose...

00:08:22.271 --> 00:08:23.541
If she had been a good girl

00:08:23.641 --> 00:08:25.578
and given me the key
as she was commanded,

00:08:25.678 --> 00:08:28.182
I wouldn't have minded
letting her roam free.

00:08:28.282 --> 00:08:29.652
Wait, that's right.

00:08:29.752 --> 00:08:31.990
She was already showing some
symptoms of possession,

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:33.125
wasn't she?

00:08:33.225 --> 00:08:34.428
That makes her perfect for

00:08:34.529 --> 00:08:35.932
the Cult's experimentation.

00:08:36.032 --> 00:08:38.804
Either way,
she'll end up in our custody.

00:08:39.639 --> 00:08:40.575
[Perv]
<i>There's a chance that Rose</i>

00:08:40.675 --> 00:08:42.043

00:08:42.143 --> 00:08:44.582
<i>If that's the case I only have
to use this puppet</i>

00:08:44.682 --> 00:08:46.352
<i>to slay the King of Midgar.</i>

00:08:46.452 --> 00:08:49.692
<i>If that happens, there will be
a war between the two kingdoms</i>

00:08:49.792 --> 00:08:52.030
<i>and Oriana will
likely be destroyed.</i>

00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:55.838
<i>My current rank and status will
become just dust in the wind,</i>

00:08:55.938 --> 00:08:57.107
<i>but that doesn't matter.</i>

00:08:57.207 --> 00:08:58.944
<i>The arrangements are
already in place</i>

00:08:59.045 --> 00:09:02.785
<i>to install a puppet leader
as the next King of Midgar.</i>

00:09:02.885 --> 00:09:04.889
<i>I'll probably have the
highest chance of success</i>

00:09:04.989 --> 00:09:08.296
<i>if I act during
Iris Midgar's match.</i>

00:09:08.396 --> 00:09:11.035
<i>But this Mundane Mann...</i>

00:09:11.135 --> 00:09:13.741
<i>I looked into his background
and found nothing.</i>

00:09:13.841 --> 00:09:16.278
<i>I have no doubt he is a
resident of the underworld</i>

00:09:16.378 --> 00:09:19.785
<i>and one in a very dangerous
position at that.</i>

00:09:19.886 --> 00:09:21.723
<i>What purpose can
he possibly have</i>

00:09:21.823 --> 00:09:23.894
<i>for coming out into the light?</i>

00:09:23.995 --> 00:09:26.800
<i>I've deployed the greatest
number of soldiers possible,</i>

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:29.606
<i>but now I'm worried about
Shadow Garden.</i>

00:09:29.706 --> 00:09:31.476
<i>How will they react
to all of this?</i>

00:09:31.577 --> 00:09:35.784
<i>It would appear that they
are working in conjunction
with Rose.</i>

00:09:35.884 --> 00:09:37.153
[Beatrix] You stink.

00:09:37.253 --> 00:09:38.322
Huh?

00:09:38.422 --> 00:09:39.659
You stink.

00:09:39.759 --> 00:09:41.697
[Perv] How dare you say
that to His Majesty?!

00:09:41.797 --> 00:09:43.734
Guards,
remove this woman immediately!

00:09:43.834 --> 00:09:45.169
[Iris] Lord Perv!

00:09:45.269 --> 00:09:46.507
[Perv] Oh, Princess Iris.

00:09:46.607 --> 00:09:48.409
Please let me introduce you.

00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:50.113
This woman is my invited guest.

00:09:50.213 --> 00:09:53.319
This is the legendary Beatrix,
the Goddess of War.

00:09:54.488 --> 00:09:56.359
[Perv] <i>Huh? Beatrix?</i>

00:09:56.459 --> 00:09:59.397
<i>The woman who may have awakened
the hero's blood within?</i>

00:09:59.498 --> 00:10:00.902
<i>That Beatrix?</i>

00:10:01.002 --> 00:10:02.037
Sorry.

00:10:02.137 --> 00:10:03.306
No, I'm sorry.

00:10:03.406 --> 00:10:04.543
I may not have recognized you,

00:10:04.643 --> 00:10:05.812
but that's no excuse.

00:10:05.912 --> 00:10:09.251
Please relax and enjoy
the Bushin Festival.

00:10:09.351 --> 00:10:10.788
[Perv] <i>The Goddess of War?</i>

00:10:10.888 --> 00:10:12.659
<i>What is she doing at this
tournament of all places?</i>

00:10:12.759 --> 00:10:16.399
<i>I'm going to have to look
for an opportunity to
eliminate her.</i>

00:10:16.499 --> 00:10:17.769
<i>But how can I?</i>

00:10:17.869 --> 00:10:19.506
<i>She's even better with
a sword than Iris.</i>

00:10:19.606 --> 00:10:22.745
<i>Will it even be possible to
assassinate the King of Midgar?</i>

00:10:22.845 --> 00:10:26.185
<i>Yes, it will. As long as
Rose makes an appearance,</i>

00:10:26.285 --> 00:10:27.889
<i>everything will be fine.</i>

00:10:27.989 --> 00:10:29.458
<i>I'll just have to
capture the girl</i>

00:10:29.559 --> 00:10:32.632
<i>and proceed with our Oriana
operations as planned.</i>

00:10:32.732 --> 00:10:34.434
<i>There's nothing to worry about.</i>

00:10:34.535 --> 00:10:35.838
<i>She WILL be here.</i>

00:10:35.938 --> 00:10:38.877
<i>There shouldn't be
anything to worry about.</i>

00:10:39.344 --> 00:10:40.413
Hmm?

00:10:40.514 --> 00:10:41.817
(suspenseful music)

00:10:41.917 --> 00:10:43.887
Gotta go, gotta go, gotta go!

00:10:45.991 --> 00:10:47.327
(sighs)

00:10:47.427 --> 00:10:50.433
[Perv] <i>Why should I be envious
of any of the ignorant masses?</i>

00:10:50.534 --> 00:10:53.039
(blades crash)
(thunder rumbles)

00:10:53.139 --> 00:10:55.376
[nobles] That Claire Kagenou's
not a bad fighter.

00:10:55.476 --> 00:10:58.249
-Even the great Princess Iris
recognized her talent,

00:10:58.349 --> 00:11:00.521
and it looks like
she's gotten even better.

00:11:00.621 --> 00:11:01.890
[Perv] <i>She does have potential,</i>

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:03.927
<i>but I don't think
she'll be a threat.</i>

00:11:04.027 --> 00:11:06.498
<i>Honestly, if all of them
could be at her level,</i>

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:08.770
<i>my job would be
so much easier.</i>

00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:14.849
[ref]
The winner, Claire Kagenou.

00:11:14.949 --> 00:11:17.822
(excited chatter)
(crowd cheering)

00:11:17.922 --> 00:11:19.024
[spectators] Princess Iris!

00:11:19.125 --> 00:11:21.329
-I know you will win,
Your Highness!

00:11:21.429 --> 00:11:24.134
-Bring us victory!

00:11:24.234 --> 00:11:27.741
[Iris] <i>These cheers are my
strength AND my mission.</i>

00:11:27.842 --> 00:11:29.880
<i>"As long as we have
Iris Midgar,</i>

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:31.849
<i>the kingdom will be safe."</i>

00:11:31.949 --> 00:11:35.156
<i>I need them to think that,
to keep thinking that!</i>

00:11:35.256 --> 00:11:37.861
<i>And to make sure they do...</i>
(crowd cheering)

00:11:41.636 --> 00:11:43.006
<i>Mundane Mann...</i>
(suspenseful music)

00:11:43.106 --> 00:11:46.946
<i>He is, without a doubt,
a powerful opponent.</i>

00:11:47.046 --> 00:11:48.917
<i>Even standing
face-to-face with him,</i>

00:11:49.017 --> 00:11:51.823
<i>I can't sense an iota of
strength from him.</i>

00:11:51.924 --> 00:11:53.292
<i>But there's
something about him,</i>

00:11:53.392 --> 00:11:55.330
<i>something I can't
put my finger on.</i>

00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:58.803
<i>Nevertheless, I'm still
confident I can defeat him.</i>

00:11:58.904 --> 00:12:00.440
<i>I'll give it
everything I've got</i>

00:12:00.541 --> 00:12:02.043
<i>as soon as the match begins.</i>

00:12:02.144 --> 00:12:03.781
<i>Whatever it is
that he's hiding,</i>

00:12:03.881 --> 00:12:06.251
<i>I won't give him even
a second to reveal it.</i>

00:12:06.352 --> 00:12:08.757
<i>I will finish this
with one blow.</i>

00:12:08.858 --> 00:12:10.861

Moving on to our second match,

00:12:10.961 --> 00:12:14.535
Iris Midgar versus
Mundane Mann.

00:12:14.635 --> 00:12:16.706
Let the fight begin!

00:12:16.807 --> 00:12:19.177
(blood splattering)
(ominous music)

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:25.189
(single heartbeat)

00:12:36.947 --> 00:12:40.787
[Claire]
He's probably goofing off and
checking out the food stands.

00:12:44.996 --> 00:12:47.234
(general crowd chatter)

00:12:47.334 --> 00:12:49.404

00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:59.625
[Iris]
<i>What? I was sure he just...</i>

00:12:59.725 --> 00:13:02.063
(suspenseful music)

00:13:04.301 --> 00:13:05.504
<i>How?</i>

00:13:05.604 --> 00:13:07.473
<i>He's so far.</i>

00:13:09.177 --> 00:13:10.413
<i>What?</i>

00:13:10.514 --> 00:13:12.317
You're not attacking?

00:13:12.417 --> 00:13:13.686
(gasps)

00:13:13.787 --> 00:13:15.524
<i>Impossible...</i>

00:13:15.624 --> 00:13:17.895
<i>I backed away from him?</i>

00:13:17.995 --> 00:13:21.034
<i>I instinctively
sensed my death.</i>
(crowd murmuring)

<i>Don't be afraid.</i>

00:13:25.043 --> 00:13:27.648
<i>Fear makes your enemies
seem more powerful.</i>

00:13:27.749 --> 00:13:29.618
<i>Reject the fear
and step forward</i>

00:13:29.718 --> 00:13:31.889
<i>right into his striking range!</i>

00:13:35.396 --> 00:13:36.298
<i>He cut me?</i>

00:13:36.399 --> 00:13:38.837
<i>It can't be!
Was it an illusion?</i>

00:13:38.937 --> 00:13:40.708
<i>But he definitely reached me,</i>

00:13:40.808 --> 00:13:42.210
<i>and that means that
this entire arena</i>

00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:44.515
<i>is in his sword's
striking range.</i>

00:13:48.255 --> 00:13:50.093
I've almost reached
the VIP seats,

00:13:50.193 --> 00:13:52.096
but there are
no security guards.

(gasps)

00:13:57.875 --> 00:14:00.279
They never even stood a chance.

(heavy sigh)

00:14:03.753 --> 00:14:05.691
There's only one...

(gasp)

00:14:07.327 --> 00:14:09.666
[Rose] I knew it; it was you.

00:14:09.766 --> 00:14:11.669
Now go forward...

00:14:11.769 --> 00:14:13.973
and fulfill your mission.

(ominous music)

00:14:27.467 --> 00:14:28.837
<i>It's his eyes,</i>

00:14:28.937 --> 00:14:32.544
<i>and a slight shift in
his center of gravity.</i>

00:14:32.644 --> 00:14:33.880
<i>Those tiny changes were enough</i>

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:36.519
<i>to make me hallucinate
that he struck me.</i>

(ungh)

00:14:38.723 --> 00:14:41.395
<i>It's not some trick that
relies on an artifact.</i>

00:14:41.495 --> 00:14:44.367
<i>It is most definitely
his own true skill.</i>

00:14:44.467 --> 00:14:45.704
<i>I know that much.</i>

00:14:45.805 --> 00:14:47.040
<i>I know but...</i>

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:48.576
<i>If he can do that,</i>

00:14:48.676 --> 00:14:52.183
<i>that would make him the
world's most powerful...</i>

[spectators]
Hey, what's been going on
with Princess Iris?

00:14:56.225 --> 00:14:59.566
-She just keeps staggering
back and forth across
the arena.

00:14:59.666 --> 00:15:00.867
-Don't tell me she's afraid.

00:15:00.967 --> 00:15:03.273
-Shut your mouth!
That's Princess Iris.

00:15:03.373 --> 00:15:05.410
-How can you even say
something like that?

00:15:05.511 --> 00:15:07.648
(continued mutterings)

00:15:10.353 --> 00:15:12.490

<i>Don't let him confuse you.</i>

00:15:17.467 --> 00:15:18.670
<i>Don't stand still!</i>

00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:21.909
<i>Whether they're illusions
or real swords strikes,</i>

00:15:22.009 --> 00:15:25.182
<i>I will strike them
all down together!</i>

00:15:25.884 --> 00:15:28.222
(hyaah)

00:15:32.798 --> 00:15:34.000
[Iris] <i>How?</i>

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:35.537
<i>His sword...</i>

00:15:35.637 --> 00:15:37.274
<i>is in its sheath?</i>

00:15:37.374 --> 00:15:39.912
<i>Is this another illusion?</i>

00:15:40.012 --> 00:15:43.085
<i>No, everything else was.</i>

00:15:43.185 --> 00:15:45.490
<i>A leading gaze and slight
movements of his body</i>

00:15:45.591 --> 00:15:48.429
<i>were all tricks to make me
see things that weren't there.</i>

00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:51.836
<i>To make me THINK
he was holding his sword.</i>

(suspenseful music)

00:15:58.817 --> 00:16:00.319

(music fading out)

00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:10.172
What's the matter?

00:16:10.272 --> 00:16:12.110
We're just getting started.
(thunder rumbling)

00:16:12.210 --> 00:16:15.049
Aren't we, Iris Midgar?

00:16:15.149 --> 00:16:17.019

[Midgar] (sighs)

00:16:33.987 --> 00:16:35.256
[nobles] She lost?

00:16:35.356 --> 00:16:37.961
-No, not Princess Iris.

00:16:38.061 --> 00:16:40.433
Impossible...
Iris Midgard was defeated

00:16:40.534 --> 00:16:43.172
before she was able
to make a single move?

00:16:43.272 --> 00:16:44.709
[Perv] <i>And by such a...</i>

00:16:44.809 --> 00:16:47.247
<i>You mean to tell me that
he has that kind of skill?</i>

00:16:47.347 --> 00:16:49.351
<i>Not even the strongest
Dark Knight I know</i>

00:16:49.451 --> 00:16:51.656
<i>would be capable of
such a stunt like that.</i>

00:16:51.756 --> 00:16:54.729
<i>No, such a thing
should not be possible.</i>

00:16:54.829 --> 00:16:55.764
<i>Huh?</i>

00:16:55.864 --> 00:16:57.233
An amazing technique...

00:16:57.333 --> 00:16:59.271
I want to fight him.

00:16:59.371 --> 00:17:00.875
(growls)
(indisticnt noble chatter)

00:17:00.975 --> 00:17:02.043
[nobles] Isn't that...

00:17:02.143 --> 00:17:03.914
-No, it can't be!

00:17:04.014 --> 00:17:05.216
-Are you seeing this?

00:17:05.316 --> 00:17:06.820
-I-I'm crazy, right?

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:08.022
-You're kidding, right?

00:17:08.122 --> 00:17:09.792
She's here.

00:17:12.532 --> 00:17:15.035
(ominous music)

00:17:15.136 --> 00:17:16.506
(Perv laughing)

00:17:16.606 --> 00:17:19.277
You finally decided
to come back to us,

00:17:19.377 --> 00:17:22.050
my dear, sweet Princess Rose.

00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:25.356
His Majesty awaited
your return.

00:17:25.456 --> 00:17:31.101
(haltingly) Rose,
I'm so glad that you're back.

00:17:31.201 --> 00:17:34.642
Please come closer.

00:17:36.613 --> 00:17:38.282
[Rose] Father...

00:17:38.382 --> 00:17:42.190
I've come to apologize for
everything I've done,

00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:44.962
and for what I'm about to do.

00:17:45.062 --> 00:17:50.006
I've made mistakes and I'm sure
I will make at least one more.

00:17:50.106 --> 00:17:53.111
But as the princess of the
Oriana Kingdom...

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:55.717
and as your daughter...

00:17:57.119 --> 00:18:00.660
I will follow the path
that I believe in.

00:18:03.332 --> 00:18:06.639
[Oriana]
I forgive you, all your sins.

00:18:06.739 --> 00:18:08.944
[Perv] Hey, I didn't
instruct you to say that.

00:18:09.044 --> 00:18:10.947
How dare you think you can-

00:18:11.047 --> 00:18:12.117
[Rose] Thank you, Father.

00:18:12.217 --> 00:18:13.118
[Perv] Huh?

00:18:13.218 --> 00:18:14.722
[Rose] Father!

00:18:18.864 --> 00:18:21.201
(blood splatters)

00:18:22.605 --> 00:18:24.742
(blood dripping)

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:31.054
(mumbling) Rose... I...

00:18:31.154 --> 00:18:35.295
I... love... you...
(Rose sobbing)

00:18:37.802 --> 00:18:38.903
(thud)

00:18:39.003 --> 00:18:41.943
What in the...
Why would she...

00:18:42.043 --> 00:18:45.618
You would kill your own father
without a second thought?

00:18:45.718 --> 00:18:49.023
What is with you stabbing
people? How dare you?!

00:18:49.123 --> 00:18:52.898
Who do you think was supposed
to benefit from this puppet's-
(gasp)

00:18:54.334 --> 00:18:57.273
This is my last official act
as princess.

00:18:57.874 --> 00:18:59.712
Stop her!

00:19:02.518 --> 00:19:05.089
[Mundane]
Is that the choice you've made?

00:19:05.189 --> 00:19:07.527
(glass shattering)

00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:11.468
(suspenseful music)

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:22.657
(dramatic music)

00:19:25.196 --> 00:19:27.802
It's... it's you.

00:19:27.902 --> 00:19:30.573
[Mundane] The time has come
to shed my disguise.

00:19:30.673 --> 00:19:32.678
You're...

00:19:32.778 --> 00:19:34.882
[Rose] But you can't be!

00:19:34.982 --> 00:19:36.284
[Mundane] My name is Shadow.

00:19:36.385 --> 00:19:38.322
Wait, I mean...

00:19:38.422 --> 00:19:39.458
[Shadow] My name is Shadow.

00:19:39.559 --> 00:19:41.662
[Rose]
The Stylish Bandit Slayer!

00:19:41.762 --> 00:19:42.898
Huh?

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:45.937
[all] Stylish?

00:19:46.037 --> 00:19:48.242
Bandit Slayer?

00:19:48.342 --> 00:19:49.745
I can't believe
it's really you!

00:19:49.845 --> 00:19:52.249
The one with such beautiful
fencing skills.

00:19:52.349 --> 00:19:54.353
From the day I first saw you
wield your sword,

00:19:54.454 --> 00:19:58.630
I've been determined to follow
the path of a fencer myself.

00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:00.166
(maniacal laughter)
(blood splattering)

00:20:00.266 --> 00:20:02.771
[Young Cid] Anyone who's
running is a bandit!

00:20:03.472 --> 00:20:05.109
Anyone who's not running,

00:20:05.209 --> 00:20:07.180
is a well trained bandit!

00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:08.783
[bandits] He's a barbarian!

00:20:08.883 --> 00:20:10.052
-Run!
-Don't kill me!

00:20:10.153 --> 00:20:11.455
(bandits dying)

00:20:11.556 --> 00:20:13.527
-Who the hell are you?

00:20:13.627 --> 00:20:16.799
[Young Cid]
Take this! Stylish Sword!

00:20:16.899 --> 00:20:18.269
[bandit] Boss! No!

00:20:18.369 --> 00:20:22.043
[Young Cid] Go on and run!
And leave the money behind!

00:20:22.143 --> 00:20:25.215
(suspenseful music)

00:20:25.316 --> 00:20:26.953
[Young Cid]
Rough day for you, huh?

00:20:27.053 --> 00:20:28.990
Be careful on your way home,
okay?

00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:30.360
[Young Rose] Wait.
[Young Cid] Hmm?

00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:32.697
Please tell me who are you?

00:20:32.798 --> 00:20:34.467
[Young Cid] Me?

00:20:35.302 --> 00:20:37.073
Good question.

00:20:37.173 --> 00:20:39.812
I'm still in the middle
of my training so,

00:20:39.912 --> 00:20:42.384
I guess you could say I'm a
stylish bandit slayer,

00:20:42.484 --> 00:20:44.353
just passing through.

00:20:45.055 --> 00:20:46.491
What does that mean?

00:20:46.592 --> 00:20:49.397
The Stylish Bandit Slayer?

00:20:49.998 --> 00:20:51.334
Shadow...

00:20:51.434 --> 00:20:53.272
You have been the
Stylish Bandit Slayer

00:20:53.372 --> 00:20:54.642
all along haven't you?

00:20:54.742 --> 00:20:56.746
I really thought that was
a therianthrope girl.

00:20:56.846 --> 00:20:59.251
Even at that age, you never
feared the solitude.

00:20:59.351 --> 00:21:01.956
You continued the
fight against evil.

00:21:02.056 --> 00:21:03.560
But I couldn't take it.

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:07.701
I just wanted to end my pain,
and I almost chose death.

00:21:07.801 --> 00:21:09.939
I still have
the power to fight,

00:21:10.039 --> 00:21:12.778
but I'm so scared. (small sob)

00:21:12.878 --> 00:21:15.416
[Shadow] Raise your head.
(music ends abruptly)

00:21:15.517 --> 00:21:19.224
Your fight has not yet ended,
Princess.

00:21:19.324 --> 00:21:21.662
(suspenseful music resumes)

00:21:23.165 --> 00:21:25.503
(Rose whimpering)

00:21:26.305 --> 00:21:27.206
Right!

00:21:27.306 --> 00:21:29.277
[Perv] What? Hey!

00:21:29.377 --> 00:21:30.279
[noble] President Rose!

00:21:30.379 --> 00:21:32.049
Get out of here now!

00:21:32.885 --> 00:21:33.953
[Perv] Come back here!

00:21:34.053 --> 00:21:35.122
Don't let her get away!

00:21:35.222 --> 00:21:36.125
(gasps)

00:21:36.225 --> 00:21:38.830
Sty... I mean, Shadow!

00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:40.032
Damn it!

00:21:40.132 --> 00:21:41.401
Where are my reinforcements?

00:21:41.502 --> 00:21:43.338
Isn't anybody here?

00:21:43.906 --> 00:21:45.577
I will do it.

00:21:47.046 --> 00:21:48.482
(chuckles)

00:21:48.583 --> 00:21:50.920
(blades clashing)

00:21:54.227 --> 00:21:56.565
(music intensifies)

00:22:00.172 --> 00:22:04.615
[Perv] Beatrix, the Goddess of
War, which means I can now...

00:22:10.092 --> 00:22:12.429
(blades clashing)

00:22:14.635 --> 00:22:16.939
(music fading out)

00:22:21.348 --> 00:22:23.686
(ENDING THEME)
