00:00:02.539 --> 00:00:04.676
(echoing footsteps)

00:00:11.924 --> 00:00:14.261
(religious chant music)

00:00:15.665 --> 00:00:17.167
(gasps)

00:00:21.409 --> 00:00:24.148
A man clad in
the purest black...

00:00:24.248 --> 00:00:25.317
[Zenon] I see.

00:00:25.418 --> 00:00:26.621
So you're the stray dog
that's been

00:00:26.721 --> 00:00:28.557
snapping at the Cult lately.

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:33.266
My name is Shadow.

00:00:33.367 --> 00:00:37.207
He who lurks in the shadows
in order to hunt the shadows.

00:00:38.778 --> 00:00:39.913
It's Shadow?

00:00:40.013 --> 00:00:41.550
[Zenon]
You seem quite cocky for someone

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.488
who has only crushed a few of
our smaller facilities.

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:46.226
Too bad, none of the
Cult's core members

00:00:46.326 --> 00:00:48.931
were anywhere near
any of those bases.

00:00:49.031 --> 00:00:50.401
You're just a bunch of cowards

00:00:50.502 --> 00:00:52.506
going after our
weakest minions.

00:00:52.606 --> 00:00:56.346
Whomever or wherever we hunt,
the result is the same.

00:00:56.446 --> 00:00:58.618
Unfortunately for you,
it isn't.

00:00:58.718 --> 00:01:01.322
And a core member of the Cult
is right here.

00:01:02.826 --> 00:01:06.366
As luck would have it, on this
day, you will be hunted by me,

00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:10.140
the future Twelfth Seat of
Rounds, Zenon Griffey.

00:01:11.176 --> 00:01:12.478
I will take your life

00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:16.085
in the honorable service
of the Knights of Rounds!

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:17.589
(schwing)

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:19.224
(gasps)
(explosion)

00:01:21.462 --> 00:01:22.297
(gasps)

00:01:22.397 --> 00:01:24.769
(dramatic music)
(gasps)

00:01:27.976 --> 00:01:29.478
[Shadow] So?

00:01:30.715 --> 00:01:33.587
Where is this
"core member of the Cult"?

00:01:33.687 --> 00:01:35.190
(angry growl)

00:01:40.836 --> 00:01:43.139
(OPENING THEME)

00:03:14.188 --> 00:03:15.525
(dramtic music)

00:03:15.625 --> 00:03:16.893
[soldiers]
We've evacuated citizens

00:03:16.993 --> 00:03:19.098
from Commercial Districts
Three through Eight.

00:03:19.198 --> 00:03:20.467
-Close the station!

00:03:20.568 --> 00:03:22.305
Have the trains take shelter
three stations down!

00:03:22.405 --> 00:03:23.774
All of them!
(loud rumble)

00:03:23.875 --> 00:03:25.110
(men screaming)

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:27.548
(heavy footsteps)

00:03:31.156 --> 00:03:32.224
[captain] Fire, fire!

00:03:32.324 --> 00:03:34.662
(gunshots)

00:03:36.265 --> 00:03:38.604
(growls)

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.588
(growls)

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.628
(steam hissing)

00:03:52.098 --> 00:03:52.999
[knights] What?

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:54.736
-It healed itself?

00:03:55.805 --> 00:03:57.207
(angry growl)

00:03:57.307 --> 00:03:58.977
(scream)

00:03:59.946 --> 00:04:01.415
[knights] Holy crap!

00:04:01.516 --> 00:04:04.254
-Rally all nearby units!
-Aye, Sir!

00:04:04.355 --> 00:04:06.459
-We'll try to keep
the monster here.

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.263
Don't worry about
damaging buildings!

00:04:08.363 --> 00:04:11.135
-Clearance for any extreme
measures needed.
(people screaming in panic)

00:04:11.235 --> 00:04:13.507
Do whatever it takes
to stop that thing!

00:04:17.014 --> 00:04:18.684
Hyah!

00:04:19.051 --> 00:04:21.388
(growls)

00:04:21.924 --> 00:04:23.426
You monster!

00:04:23.994 --> 00:04:26.332
(growls)

00:04:27.367 --> 00:04:28.904
[knight] Princess Iris!

00:04:29.806 --> 00:04:31.509
The injured will
need to retreat!

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.313
This district
will soon be deserted!

00:04:33.413 --> 00:04:35.684
Then we can start... (gasps)

00:04:36.085 --> 00:04:38.423
(growls)

00:04:38.524 --> 00:04:39.893
It's healing itself.

00:04:39.993 --> 00:04:42.999
But that was an attack from
Princess Iris!

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:45.436
(heavy footsteps)

00:04:47.809 --> 00:04:49.946
(growls)

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.186
Hyah!

00:04:53.286 --> 00:04:55.624
(growls)

00:04:59.431 --> 00:05:01.736
(growls)

00:05:06.279 --> 00:05:08.617
(loud growl)

00:05:09.352 --> 00:05:11.690
(music crescendos)

00:05:14.763 --> 00:05:17.602
[Iris]
You can heal that, too, can you?

00:05:17.702 --> 00:05:20.207
In that case, I'll just have to
cut you into pieces

00:05:20.307 --> 00:05:22.712
so small you CAN'T regenerate!

00:05:23.514 --> 00:05:25.918
(attack growl)

00:05:26.018 --> 00:05:28.356
Hyaaaah!

00:05:31.997 --> 00:05:34.134
(growls)

00:05:34.736 --> 00:05:35.805
Hyah!

00:05:35.905 --> 00:05:38.042
(growls)

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.550
I'll keep going!

00:05:42.819 --> 00:05:44.923
[Alpha]
You're only making her suffer.

00:05:45.023 --> 00:05:46.492
Don't you realize that?

00:05:46.594 --> 00:05:48.163
(startled gasp)

00:05:48.263 --> 00:05:50.601
(driving techno music)

00:05:55.043 --> 00:05:56.546
Who are you?

00:05:57.281 --> 00:05:59.018
Alpha.

00:05:59.118 --> 00:06:01.455
(growls)

00:06:04.829 --> 00:06:06.032
(gasps)

00:06:06.132 --> 00:06:07.768
The monster...

00:06:09.138 --> 00:06:10.441
(Iris gasps)
(ting)

00:06:10.542 --> 00:06:13.245
(dramtic choral music)

00:06:13.346 --> 00:06:14.816
You poor thing.

00:06:14.917 --> 00:06:16.085
I know it hurts.

00:06:16.185 --> 00:06:18.557
You don't have to
suffer any more.

00:06:18.991 --> 00:06:20.493
(ching)

00:06:22.965 --> 00:06:27.173
You don't have to feel any more
pain, any more sadness.

00:06:35.257 --> 00:06:37.595
(large explosion)

00:07:00.273 --> 00:07:02.611
(raining)

00:07:17.341 --> 00:07:18.844
[Iris] You're...

00:07:20.915 --> 00:07:22.585
Wait, come back!

00:07:22.685 --> 00:07:24.856
[Alpha] Why don't you be
a good audience member

00:07:24.956 --> 00:07:26.594
and content yourself
with sitting back

00:07:26.694 --> 00:07:28.396
and enjoying the show.

00:07:28.496 --> 00:07:29.633
We are Shadow Garden,

00:07:29.733 --> 00:07:32.037
and you will
stay out of our way.

00:07:34.576 --> 00:07:36.913
(wind blows)

00:07:39.886 --> 00:07:42.323
So YOU are Shadow Garden?

00:07:42.424 --> 00:07:44.762
(loud explosion)

00:07:45.564 --> 00:07:48.335
It's happening everywhere!

00:07:48.436 --> 00:07:51.408
Alexia,
where in the world are you?

00:07:51.509 --> 00:07:53.847
(raining)

00:07:56.686 --> 00:07:59.592
(swords clashing)
(driving music)

00:08:00.393 --> 00:08:01.462
Oh, I see...

00:08:01.564 --> 00:08:03.433
Apparently,
I've underestimated you.

00:08:03.534 --> 00:08:05.604
I understand how you've
managed to destroy

00:08:05.704 --> 00:08:08.142
so many of our smaller bases.

00:08:09.111 --> 00:08:10.146
Let me show you!

00:08:10.246 --> 00:08:13.086
Behold the power of a future
Knight of Rounds!

00:08:13.186 --> 00:08:15.524
[electrical discharge]

00:08:16.694 --> 00:08:19.031
He has so much magic.

00:08:19.131 --> 00:08:21.268
Hyaaah!

00:08:25.176 --> 00:08:27.515
(swords clang)

00:08:31.288 --> 00:08:33.660
Hyaaah!
(electrical discharge)

00:08:39.171 --> 00:08:41.308
(startled gasps)

00:08:47.555 --> 00:08:49.058
He's strong.

00:08:49.158 --> 00:08:50.393
Dammit!

00:08:50.493 --> 00:08:51.996
Ah, huh?

00:08:54.936 --> 00:08:56.171
No attack?

00:08:56.271 --> 00:08:58.076
"Future Knight of Rounds"?

00:08:58.176 --> 00:09:00.314
(angry growl)

00:09:00.414 --> 00:09:02.250
Hyah!

00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:07.227
Hyaaah!

00:09:10.534 --> 00:09:13.940
Hyah! Hyah! Hyaaah!

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:21.055
[Alexia] <i>His technique has
gone beyond excellent</i>

00:09:21.155 --> 00:09:23.794
<i>and into the realms
of transcendent.</i>

00:09:23.894 --> 00:09:26.098
<i>But at its core...</i>

00:09:26.967 --> 00:09:29.205
<i>his fencing is so ordinary.</i>

00:09:29.305 --> 00:09:32.611
<i>Like I dreamed of
when I was a little girl.</i>

00:09:32.711 --> 00:09:34.783
<i>My ridiculous sense of the
ideal swordplay.</i>

00:09:34.883 --> 00:09:36.385
(haunting violin music)

00:09:36.485 --> 00:09:39.358
<i>Even without the innate talent
for the sword my sister had,</i>

00:09:39.458 --> 00:09:42.699
<i>I believed that, if I worked
long and hard enough,</i>

00:09:42.799 --> 00:09:44.969

00:09:45.571 --> 00:09:46.907

<i>No matter how hard I tried,</i>

00:09:48.309 --> 00:09:51.148
<i>I could never catch up
to the prodigy.</i>

00:09:51.248 --> 00:09:52.852
<i>The best I could ever do</i>

00:09:52.952 --> 00:09:57.427
<i>was to get people to compare me
to her, and laugh at me.</i>

00:09:57.528 --> 00:10:01.569
<i>The fencing style of someone
with no strength and no skill:</i>

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:04.743
<i>the style of a
Fencer Ordinaire.</i>

00:10:04.843 --> 00:10:06.714
<i>But I couldn't give it up.</i>

00:10:06.814 --> 00:10:09.018

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:17.234
[Iris]
I like your fencing style.

00:10:17.334 --> 00:10:19.004
(gasps)

00:10:21.008 --> 00:10:22.678
(slashes)

(grunts in pain)

00:10:30.728 --> 00:10:32.732
Who are you?
Show your face!

00:10:32.832 --> 00:10:35.270
If you have so much power,
why hide your identity?!

00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:37.207
You're nothing but a coward!

00:10:37.741 --> 00:10:39.211
(chuckles)

00:10:39.311 --> 00:10:41.114
We are Shadow Garden.

00:10:41.214 --> 00:10:44.990
They who lurk in the shadows,
who hunt the shadows.

00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:49.297
Indeed, that is the solitary
purpose of our existence.

00:10:49.397 --> 00:10:52.237
Are you completely insane?

00:10:53.774 --> 00:10:55.443
[Alexia] Shadow Garden?

00:10:56.613 --> 00:10:58.283
And there's a cult?

00:10:58.383 --> 00:11:00.052
What is going on?

00:11:00.152 --> 00:11:03.025
[Zenon] (chuckles) All right...

00:11:03.125 --> 00:11:05.363
Now if you really
want to have a fight,

00:11:05.463 --> 00:11:08.503
then I will give you the fight
you've been looking for.

00:11:08.603 --> 00:11:10.775
With these pills,
a man can awaken

00:11:10.875 --> 00:11:13.881
to a new nature
beyond human limitations!

00:11:13.981 --> 00:11:15.449
If an ordinary person
took them,

00:11:15.551 --> 00:11:18.422
he would be overwhelmed by
their tremendous power and die.

00:11:18.523 --> 00:11:20.192
(bottle cork opens) But...

00:11:23.701 --> 00:11:24.770

00:11:41.435 --> 00:11:43.907
I am the Third Awakened.

(loud rumble)

00:11:47.949 --> 00:11:52.791
Those who can control this
power are the real chosen ones.

00:11:52.891 --> 00:11:55.998
The ones worthy to join
the Knights of Rounds.

00:12:00.541 --> 00:12:02.377
Let me show you...

00:12:03.781 --> 00:12:05.651
almighty power!

00:12:05.752 --> 00:12:08.088
(intense music)

00:12:16.472 --> 00:12:18.475
[Shadow] How hideous.

00:12:24.622 --> 00:12:26.960

00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:30.801
(Alexia gasps)

00:12:36.278 --> 00:12:37.815
[Shadow]
If that's the best you can do,

00:12:37.915 --> 00:12:39.986
don't claim to be almighty.

00:12:41.021 --> 00:12:42.891
That's blasphemy.

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:45.998
(swords clang)

00:12:49.739 --> 00:12:51.408
Dammit...

00:13:01.596 --> 00:13:03.099
There is no road
to almightiness

00:13:03.199 --> 00:13:04.969
for those using
borrowed strength.

00:13:05.069 --> 00:13:07.140
None!
(glass shatters)

00:13:08.409 --> 00:13:10.079
(groans)

00:13:11.481 --> 00:13:12.851
Huh?

00:13:16.993 --> 00:13:18.930
Playtime is over.

00:13:19.766 --> 00:13:21.435
(gasps)

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:25.845
[Zenon] What is all this?

00:13:25.945 --> 00:13:28.015
Is this magical energy?

00:13:28.115 --> 00:13:29.618
But there's so much of it!

00:13:29.719 --> 00:13:31.522
A single person
could never do this!

00:13:31.622 --> 00:13:33.025
[Shadow] Once upon a time,

00:13:33.125 --> 00:13:36.265
there was a man who wished to
withstand a nuclear bomb.

00:13:36.365 --> 00:13:38.770
The man built his muscles,
honed his mind,

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:40.507
perfected his skill.

00:13:40.607 --> 00:13:44.715
However, there were yet heights
he could not attain.

00:13:44.816 --> 00:13:47.153
(music building)

00:13:50.293 --> 00:13:53.967
But I couldn't
allow myself to give up.

00:13:54.067 --> 00:13:56.906
So after years upon
years of training,

00:13:57.006 --> 00:13:59.411
I arrived at a single solution.

00:14:01.081 --> 00:14:04.656
If I don't want to be vaporized
in a nuclear explosion,

00:14:04.756 --> 00:14:07.393
I must become nuclear myself.

00:14:10.968 --> 00:14:12.871
You're out of your mind!

00:14:21.689 --> 00:14:23.125
Let the true meaning
of "almighty"

00:14:23.225 --> 00:14:25.296
be carved into your soul.

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.638
This is my almighty power.

00:14:30.874 --> 00:14:33.513
I am...

00:14:34.749 --> 00:14:36.485
atomic.

00:14:37.955 --> 00:14:40.326
(ching)
(explosion)

00:14:43.399 --> 00:14:45.069
(gaaah)

00:14:49.044 --> 00:14:51.381
(loud rumbling)

00:14:55.725 --> 00:14:57.995
(loud explosion)

00:14:58.096 --> 00:15:00.432
(intense music)

00:15:09.418 --> 00:15:11.556
(music building)

00:15:29.659 --> 00:15:31.161
(ungh)

00:15:32.998 --> 00:15:34.502
Alexia!

00:15:35.538 --> 00:15:37.674
(intense music)

00:15:41.749 --> 00:15:44.087
(quiet reigns)

00:15:45.858 --> 00:15:47.762
(heavy breathing)

00:15:47.862 --> 00:15:50.199
(water cascading)

00:16:21.461 --> 00:16:22.764
(schwing)

00:16:23.633 --> 00:16:25.135
(schwing)

00:16:25.604 --> 00:16:27.106
(schwing)

00:16:31.683 --> 00:16:32.751
[Iris] Alexia!

00:16:32.851 --> 00:16:34.354
(gasps)

00:16:35.489 --> 00:16:37.159
(Iris jumping)

00:16:38.964 --> 00:16:40.466
Alexia!

00:16:42.838 --> 00:16:45.009
I can't believe I found you.

00:16:45.978 --> 00:16:48.349
You're all right!

00:16:48.449 --> 00:16:50.286
Thank God!
What happened to you out there?

00:16:50.386 --> 00:16:52.156
Are you injured at all?

00:16:53.426 --> 00:16:54.562
Uh...

00:17:02.678 --> 00:17:04.515
[Alexia] Thank you...

00:17:05.951 --> 00:17:08.422
Thank you, Iris.

00:17:08.523 --> 00:17:10.660
(mellow music)

00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:13.766
(birds chirping)

00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:21.414
I think there's more to the
plot than meets the eye,

00:17:21.516 --> 00:17:24.689
but as far as the public is
concerned, the case is solved.

00:17:24.789 --> 00:17:27.761
Wow, that's so cool.

00:17:27.861 --> 00:17:29.498
Guess I'm done here, then.

00:17:29.599 --> 00:17:31.602
[Alexia] No, wait!

00:17:31.702 --> 00:17:33.507
[Cid] Hm?
[Alexia] Um...

00:17:33.607 --> 00:17:36.312
There's something
I wanted to talk about.

00:17:36.412 --> 00:17:37.915
You told me before that you

00:17:38.015 --> 00:17:40.286
liked my fencing style,
remember?

00:17:41.288 --> 00:17:43.091
Maybe it's too late...

00:17:43.191 --> 00:17:45.062
Thank you.

00:17:45.162 --> 00:17:46.799
You're welcome, I guess.

00:17:46.899 --> 00:17:50.073
I have finally learned to
appreciate my sword style.

00:17:50.173 --> 00:17:52.778
But don't think for a minute
it's because of you.

00:17:52.878 --> 00:17:55.316
Don't you think you could have
left that last part out?

00:17:55.416 --> 00:17:58.455
(chuckles)
Maybe, but it's true.

00:17:58.556 --> 00:17:59.858
(sighs)

00:18:00.694 --> 00:18:01.796
Anyway, I'm out.

00:18:01.896 --> 00:18:03.465
[Alexia] Wait!

00:18:03.566 --> 00:18:04.736
I mean...

00:18:04.836 --> 00:18:08.141
We've been pretending to be a
couple for a while now.

00:18:10.112 --> 00:18:11.916
And during the incident,

00:18:12.016 --> 00:18:14.688
Zenon kindly got
himself killed.

00:18:16.291 --> 00:18:19.565
So if you're interested...

00:18:21.802 --> 00:18:24.274
I was thinking maybe
we could try to keep

00:18:24.374 --> 00:18:27.246
this relationship
going a little longer?

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:30.820
(chuckles)

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:35.496
I'm gonna go with a "no."

00:18:35.931 --> 00:18:37.433
Ah...

00:18:38.368 --> 00:18:40.239
(embarrassed laugh)

00:18:41.107 --> 00:18:42.611
Mhm!

00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:45.651
(blood splatters)

00:18:45.751 --> 00:18:47.721
[Kagenou] <i>Later, massive
amounts of blood</i>

00:18:47.821 --> 00:18:49.726
<i>were discovered behind
the school building,</i>

00:18:49.826 --> 00:18:52.264
<i>but no body was found
in the vicinity,</i>

00:18:52.364 --> 00:18:53.633
<i>and no students or faculty</i>

00:18:53.733 --> 00:18:56.271
<i>were reported to be
injured or missing.</i>

00:18:57.608 --> 00:18:59.545
<i>This incident would eventually
go on to become</i>

00:18:59.645 --> 00:19:01.883
<i>one of the school's
Seven Mysteries:</i>

00:19:01.983 --> 00:19:03.753
<i>The Bodiless Murder.</i>

00:19:08.429 --> 00:19:10.333
(city hustle and bustle)

00:19:10.433 --> 00:19:11.936
[Beta] The Cult facility
where they were holding

00:19:12.036 --> 00:19:16.211
Princess Alexia captive
was destroyed by Lord Shadow.

00:19:16.311 --> 00:19:18.884
Zenon Griffey evaporated
without a trace.

00:19:18.984 --> 00:19:20.353
That is my report.

00:19:20.453 --> 00:19:23.960
The Boss Lord Shadow
really is the almighty one.

00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:27.667
It truly was a
most magnificent light.

00:19:27.768 --> 00:19:31.509
The entire Royal Capital bathed
in the glow of his magic.

00:19:31.609 --> 00:19:34.915
It was like looking upon
a heavenly paradise.

00:19:35.015 --> 00:19:36.251
I hope they've
learned their lesson

00:19:36.351 --> 00:19:37.788
after what they observed.

00:19:37.888 --> 00:19:39.792
They should know that
they are merely prey

00:19:39.892 --> 00:19:41.796
to be hunted in this world.

00:19:41.896 --> 00:19:45.703
One day, all of our enemies
will vanish in that light.

00:19:45.804 --> 00:19:47.775
And that day...

00:19:47.875 --> 00:19:49.377
(Beta sighs)

00:19:50.379 --> 00:19:51.782
[Alpha] Shall we continue?

00:19:51.882 --> 00:19:55.591
Uh, yes. Zeta has reported in.
She has found the target.

00:19:55.691 --> 00:19:57.426
She's going to get closer
and investigate.

00:19:57.528 --> 00:19:59.497
[Alpha]
I'll be expecting good news.

00:19:59.598 --> 00:20:02.203
[Beta] And here is a
research report from Eta.

00:20:02.303 --> 00:20:04.440
[Alpha]
It seems to be going smoothly.

00:20:05.376 --> 00:20:08.549
And finally,
we do have a pressing issue.

00:20:09.317 --> 00:20:10.820
Indeed.

00:20:11.322 --> 00:20:14.494
(ominous music)

00:20:14.595 --> 00:20:17.601
They are such fools to call
themselves by our name.

00:20:17.701 --> 00:20:20.941
Although,
they do seem to be covering
their tracks rather well.

00:20:21.041 --> 00:20:24.247
They'll never be able to escape
our all-searching eye.

00:20:24.347 --> 00:20:26.384
It's not possible.

00:20:26.485 --> 00:20:28.823
(ominous music)

00:20:33.332 --> 00:20:36.772
[Iris] The Cult of Diablos,
and Shadow Garden...

00:20:36.872 --> 00:20:39.311
There may be something
at work somewhere,

00:20:39.411 --> 00:20:43.586
somewhere beyond our grasp.
However...

00:20:43.686 --> 00:20:47.193
Do you suspect the
Knight Order of wrongdoing?
(Marco gasps)

00:20:47.293 --> 00:20:49.799
Our kingdom's most renowned
sword instructor

00:20:49.899 --> 00:20:53.840
was a dedicated supporter of
the Cult of Diablos.

00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:56.044
And considering that fact...

00:20:57.013 --> 00:20:58.516
(gulps)

00:20:58.950 --> 00:21:00.119
I see.

00:21:00.219 --> 00:21:02.824
Then we follow the plan
you have laid out?

00:21:02.924 --> 00:21:06.131
I will put together
a new investigation team.

00:21:06.231 --> 00:21:08.101
Glen, Marco...

00:21:08.201 --> 00:21:11.074
I trust both of you righteous
men with all of my heart.

00:21:11.174 --> 00:21:13.345
I'd like you to
be a part of it.

00:21:13.445 --> 00:21:15.450
If that is your command.

00:21:15.551 --> 00:21:17.854
I-I would be honored!

00:21:17.954 --> 00:21:19.457
Thank you.

00:21:20.359 --> 00:21:23.365
This object is our only clue.

00:21:23.465 --> 00:21:25.537
First,
we'll need to find someone

00:21:25.637 --> 00:21:27.974
who can decipher its functions.

00:21:29.277 --> 00:21:34.453
This, "was", "ed", and "if"?

00:21:34.922 --> 00:21:37.326
"If you wish"?

00:21:37.426 --> 00:21:39.832
"Do", "to"...

00:21:39.932 --> 00:21:41.936
Together, "grate"?

00:21:42.037 --> 00:21:44.073
"Val", "you"...

00:21:44.173 --> 00:21:46.712
[Kagenou] <i>That girl is
definitely not a princess.</i>

00:21:46.812 --> 00:21:48.850
<i>She's a natural born
killing machine.</i>

00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:50.854
Huh? Ow!

00:21:52.423 --> 00:21:54.093
What was that?

00:21:56.632 --> 00:21:57.934
Oh?

00:22:04.213 --> 00:22:05.750
You okay?

00:22:06.685 --> 00:22:07.988
Huh?

00:22:13.032 --> 00:22:15.335
(shimmering)

00:22:20.947 --> 00:22:23.084
(ENDING THEME)
