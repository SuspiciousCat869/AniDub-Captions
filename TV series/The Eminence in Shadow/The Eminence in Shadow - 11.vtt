00:00:01.102 --> 00:00:03.439
(calm music)
(birds chirping)

00:00:16.432 --> 00:00:18.972
[Kagenou] <i>I'm not picky
about a lot of things.</i>

00:00:19.072 --> 00:00:21.476
<i>Most things,
I really don't care about.</i>

00:00:21.577 --> 00:00:25.250
<i>But even so,
I do have preferences.</i>

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.220
<i>Even if it's not really
important to me,</i>

00:00:27.321 --> 00:00:31.664
<i>I like what I like and I don't
like what I don't like.</i>

00:00:31.764 --> 00:00:34.970
<i>I classify those things as
"insignificant things I like"</i>

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.010
<i>and "insignificant things
I don't like."</i>

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:39.779
(water splashing)

00:00:44.022 --> 00:00:48.797
<i>One of the insignificant things
that I like are hot springs.</i>

00:00:52.505 --> 00:00:54.242
(sighing)

00:00:54.342 --> 00:00:57.114
(humming happily)

00:00:57.214 --> 00:00:59.552
(Alexia stammering)

00:01:00.321 --> 00:01:02.391
(Cid humming happily)

00:01:02.491 --> 00:01:03.794
<i>Huh?</i>

00:01:03.894 --> 00:01:06.232
(continues humming)

00:01:10.642 --> 00:01:11.977
(donk)

00:01:12.077 --> 00:01:14.616
(continues humming)
(water splashing)

00:01:14.716 --> 00:01:16.218
[Alexia] Huh?

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:18.657
(OPENING THEME)

00:02:49.238 --> 00:02:51.576
(Cid humming happily)

00:02:52.011 --> 00:02:53.680
(donk)

00:02:54.382 --> 00:02:56.352
(small whimpers)

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.326
(humming happily)

00:03:01.563 --> 00:03:03.634
(growling)

00:03:03.734 --> 00:03:04.869
(sighs)

00:03:05.772 --> 00:03:07.910
[Alexia]
I guess you're all healed now.

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.646
[Cid] Yep, all better.

00:03:09.746 --> 00:03:10.815
[Alexia] Good.

00:03:10.915 --> 00:03:13.253
I cut you up pretty badly
when I lost my temper.

00:03:13.353 --> 00:03:14.689
I'm glad you survived.

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:17.528
Is that how a killing machine
gives a compliment?

00:03:17.628 --> 00:03:18.965
[Alexia] Did you say something?

00:03:19.065 --> 00:03:20.634
[Cid] Nope, not a word.

00:03:20.734 --> 00:03:22.839
So what brings you to Lindwurm?

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:25.578
[Alexia] I'm a special guest
for the Goddess' Trial.

00:03:25.678 --> 00:03:26.847
And you?

00:03:26.947 --> 00:03:28.149
[Cid] A friend invited me.

00:03:28.249 --> 00:03:30.588
Said there was a really
fun event going on.

00:03:30.688 --> 00:03:33.527
I'm guessing the event is
this Goddess' Trial thing.

00:03:33.628 --> 00:03:35.564
So what exactly
do people do there?

00:03:35.664 --> 00:03:37.401
[Alexia] (chuckles)
You came all the way here

00:03:37.502 --> 00:03:38.737
and you don't even know?

00:03:38.838 --> 00:03:41.041
The Goddess' Trial
is an annual event

00:03:41.141 --> 00:03:42.612
held on the one day of the year

00:03:42.712 --> 00:03:44.783
when the door to the Sanctuary
is opened.

00:03:44.883 --> 00:03:46.820
It's a fighting ritual.

00:03:46.921 --> 00:03:48.524
[Cid] Fighting?

00:03:48.624 --> 00:03:50.160
[Alexia]
Ancient warriors awaken

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.466
and come out of the Sanctuary
to compete against challengers.

00:03:53.568 --> 00:03:56.306
[Cid] So basically, you're
saying they're fighting ghosts?

00:03:56.406 --> 00:03:58.611
I wonder if that's what Alpha
was talking about?

00:03:58.711 --> 00:04:00.347
If you were hoping to
participate,

00:04:00.447 --> 00:04:01.550
then you're too late.

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.556
You have to apply
in advance to fight.

00:04:04.656 --> 00:04:06.927
The ancient warriors
only answer the call

00:04:07.027 --> 00:04:09.632
of challengers
they deem worthy.

00:04:09.732 --> 00:04:12.305
Hundreds of hopefuls try
their luck every year,

00:04:12.405 --> 00:04:14.843
but only about ten
actually get to battle.

00:04:14.943 --> 00:04:17.683
Although a few years ago,
the Wandering Swordsman Venom

00:04:17.783 --> 00:04:21.289
made waves by summoning
the Hero Olivier.

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:22.826
[Cid] Did he beat him?

00:04:22.926 --> 00:04:24.629
[Alexia] Apparently not.

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:29.338
But it's not like I was there
to SEE it, so I don't know.

00:04:29.438 --> 00:04:31.342
I couldn't even say
if the warrior he summoned

00:04:31.442 --> 00:04:33.847
was actually the real Olivier.

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:37.053
[Cid] Uh-huh...

00:04:37.154 --> 00:04:39.660
[Alexia] In case you were
wondering, I won't be fighting.

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.132
I have more important
things to do.
[Cid] Uh-huh...

00:04:43.232 --> 00:04:45.370
[Alexia] They haven't made this
information public yet,

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:47.274
but the archbishop
at the cathedral here

00:04:47.374 --> 00:04:50.013
has been murdered.
[Cid] Uh-huh...

00:04:50.113 --> 00:04:53.721
[Alexia]
There were always unsavory
rumors going around about him.

00:04:53.821 --> 00:04:57.596
And the reason I came here
was that I was supposed
to audit him.

00:04:57.696 --> 00:05:01.804
Oh, but I'm afraid I can't say
anymore to an outsider.

00:05:01.904 --> 00:05:02.839
If you wanna know more,

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:04.743
you'll have to join
the Crimson Knights.

00:05:04.843 --> 00:05:05.845
No, thank you.

00:05:05.945 --> 00:05:07.815
[Alexia] You should join
after you graduate.

00:05:07.915 --> 00:05:08.951
[Cid] No, thank you.

00:05:09.051 --> 00:05:10.822
[Alexia] I'll fill out an
application for you.

00:05:10.922 --> 00:05:12.959
[Cid] Don't!

00:05:13.059 --> 00:05:14.729
[Alexia] You're stubborn.

00:05:16.733 --> 00:05:17.969
I had assumed you would ogle me

00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:20.274
like you were trying to eat me
with your eyes,

00:05:20.374 --> 00:05:21.810
but I see I was wrong.

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:24.048
[Cid] I make it a point not to
look at people much

00:05:24.148 --> 00:05:25.584
while soaking in a hot spring.

00:05:25.684 --> 00:05:28.422
To keep us all more
comfortable while bathing.

00:05:28.925 --> 00:05:30.093
In that spirit,

00:05:30.193 --> 00:05:32.999
might I ask you to stop
glancing over at my Excalibur?

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:36.840
(short laugh) You call that
thing you have Excalibur?

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:39.513
I think the word you're
looking for is "worm."

00:05:39.613 --> 00:05:42.350
[Cid] You mustn't judge
a book by its cover.

00:05:43.319 --> 00:05:45.792
(Cid standing)
(Alexia gasps)

00:05:45.892 --> 00:05:48.597
[Cid]
You may come to find out that
what you thought was a worm

00:05:48.698 --> 00:05:52.470
was a sword that was merely
still contained in its sheath.

00:05:53.507 --> 00:05:56.478
[Alexia]
(nervously) What do you mean?

00:05:57.414 --> 00:05:58.917
(gasps)

00:05:59.853 --> 00:06:01.990
(dramatic music)

00:06:03.528 --> 00:06:05.864
(towel whipping)

00:06:08.804 --> 00:06:12.545
[Cid] When a holy sword is
removed from its sheath,

00:06:12.645 --> 00:06:15.149
its sparkling blade is set free

00:06:15.249 --> 00:06:18.022
to plunder the Garden of Chaos.

00:06:24.803 --> 00:06:26.105
(donk)

00:06:29.512 --> 00:06:31.015
(gasps)

00:06:36.594 --> 00:06:38.462
(towel whipping)

00:06:39.098 --> 00:06:41.001
(upbeat music)

00:06:41.102 --> 00:06:43.406
(general hubub)

00:06:47.582 --> 00:06:49.919
(fireworks exploding)

00:06:50.588 --> 00:06:52.925
(crowd cheering)

00:06:56.065 --> 00:06:57.702
(crowd quiets)

00:06:57.802 --> 00:07:01.710
Legend says that long ago,
to drive away the Demon
Diablos,

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:04.014
the Goddess Beatrix
bestowed her powers

00:07:04.114 --> 00:07:06.854
upon the esteemed and
courageous Hero Olivier.

00:07:06.954 --> 00:07:09.526
Olivier fought valiantly
against the demon,

00:07:09.626 --> 00:07:11.195
eventually severing
his left arm,

00:07:11.295 --> 00:07:15.537
which is said to be sealed away
in this very Sanctuary.

00:07:15.638 --> 00:07:16.874
And to this day,

00:07:16.974 --> 00:07:19.278
the ancient warriors
who fought fearlessly

00:07:19.378 --> 00:07:21.516
at Olivier's side
in this crusade

00:07:21.616 --> 00:07:25.323
await you on the other side of
the Sanctuary door!

00:07:25.423 --> 00:07:27.327
(fighters cheering)

00:07:27.427 --> 00:07:29.364
Every single one of you
know what it is

00:07:29.465 --> 00:07:32.171
that these warriors
are hoping for.

00:07:32.271 --> 00:07:34.843
[Alexia] <i>I don't like it.</i>
[Nelson] Those who will carry
on their just legacy,

00:07:34.943 --> 00:07:37.481
<i>-Acting Archbishop Nelson...</i>
(Nelson continues)

00:07:37.582 --> 00:07:38.984
<i>Freaking baldy!</i>

00:07:39.084 --> 00:07:42.023
<i>-You might want to mourn
at least a little.</i>

00:07:43.326 --> 00:07:46.332
[Alexia] You're canceling the
audit?! How can you do that?

00:07:46.432 --> 00:07:48.671
[Nelson] How can I not?

00:07:48.771 --> 00:07:50.708
The royal family sent you here

00:07:50.808 --> 00:07:53.346
to investigate His Grace,
the Archbishop,

00:07:53.446 --> 00:07:54.616
but as you can see,

00:07:54.716 --> 00:07:57.454
he has met with
grave misfortune.

00:07:57.555 --> 00:07:59.693
We in the Church must find
the vile fiend

00:07:59.793 --> 00:08:01.396
who committed this heinous act

00:08:01.496 --> 00:08:03.967
and apprehend them
without delay.

00:08:04.067 --> 00:08:06.774
And if we are to ensure that
the Goddess' Trial

00:08:06.874 --> 00:08:08.777
is carried out successfully,

00:08:08.877 --> 00:08:11.584
then I have no time to
indulge your hobbies,

00:08:11.684 --> 00:08:13.219
if you'll forgive me.

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:16.458
I ask that you please leave
Church matters to the Church,

00:08:16.559 --> 00:08:18.162
as you always have.

00:08:18.262 --> 00:08:21.770
I will personally compose a
letter to His Majesty the King.

00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:23.707
You are relieved of this task.

00:08:23.807 --> 00:08:25.209
So Princess Alexia,

00:08:25.309 --> 00:08:28.383
you may just sit back and
enjoy the Goddess' Trial.

00:08:28.483 --> 00:08:30.654
<i>I need to get back to
the Royal Capital</i>

00:08:30.755 --> 00:08:32.892
<i>and convince my father to
give his authorization again</i>

00:08:32.992 --> 00:08:34.863
<i>so the Crimson Knights
can do the audit.</i>

00:08:34.963 --> 00:08:37.267
<i>Do you have any idea how many
days that will take</i>

00:08:37.367 --> 00:08:38.537
<i>just for the trip?</i>

00:08:38.637 --> 00:08:40.006
<i>Obviously,
all the important evidence</i>

00:08:40.106 --> 00:08:42.477
<i>will be disposed of
while I'm gone.</i>

00:08:42.578 --> 00:08:43.747
<i>I could do the audit anyway,</i>

00:08:43.848 --> 00:08:45.317
<i>but I don't wanna
sour relations</i>

00:08:45.417 --> 00:08:48.156
<i>between the royal family and
the Divine Teachings.</i>

00:08:48.256 --> 00:08:51.597
<i>And Baldy is right here in
front of me screaming
"prime suspect!"</i>

00:08:51.697 --> 00:08:53.199
<i>I just don't like it!</i>

00:08:53.299 --> 00:08:54.936
[men] Miss Natsume!

00:08:55.036 --> 00:08:56.405
-I love your work!

00:08:56.506 --> 00:08:57.742
(giggling)

00:08:57.842 --> 00:09:00.446
[Alexia] <i>Speaking of things
I don't like...</i>

00:09:00.548 --> 00:09:03.286
Thank you so much
for your support!

00:09:03.386 --> 00:09:04.823
[Alexia] <i>Natsume Kafka...</i>

00:09:04.923 --> 00:09:07.562
<i>She's supposedly
a popular new author.</i>

00:09:07.662 --> 00:09:09.899
<i>But that perfectly
polished demeanor,</i>

00:09:09.999 --> 00:09:13.106
<i>that dignity could hardly come
from a rookie writer.</i>

00:09:13.206 --> 00:09:14.676
<i>I'm not buying it.</i>
(Natsume giggling)

00:09:14.776 --> 00:09:15.878
<i>Everybody knows that someone</i>

00:09:15.979 --> 00:09:17.381
<i>who looks like her
on the outside</i>

00:09:17.481 --> 00:09:20.554
<i>is actually corrupt
on the inside.</i>

00:09:20.654 --> 00:09:22.858

Hello, everyone!
(Alexia gasping)

00:09:33.446 --> 00:09:36.687
Let's give all of the fighters
all of our support, okay?

00:09:36.787 --> 00:09:38.891

"The Chronicles of Lord Shadow:
Complete Edition."</i>

00:09:48.142 --> 00:09:51.716
<i>Taking advantage of her
position as princess
and classmate</i>

00:09:51.816 --> 00:09:54.856
<i>just to get close to
Lord Shadow. The pest!</i>

00:09:54.956 --> 00:09:57.762
<i>As if she weren't sadly lacking
in talent, beauty,</i>

00:09:57.862 --> 00:09:59.098
<i>and love for Lord Shadow.</i>

00:09:59.198 --> 00:10:01.603
<i>As if she weren't inferior
in every way!</i>

00:10:01.703 --> 00:10:04.075
<i>The role she's taken is
vastly better suited</i>

00:10:04.175 --> 00:10:06.579
<i>to a charming, silver-haired,
blue-eyed elf</i>

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:08.315
<i>with a beauty mark
on her cheek!</i>

00:10:08.415 --> 00:10:09.920
<i>Everybody knows women like her</i>

00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:11.623
<i>are the most corrupt
on the inside!</i>

00:10:11.723 --> 00:10:13.627
<i>Of course Lord Shadow would
never be attracted</i>

00:10:13.727 --> 00:10:15.363
<i>to a woman of such
shoddy character-</i>

00:10:15.463 --> 00:10:17.801
(Natsume whimpering)

00:10:20.775 --> 00:10:23.880
Princess Alexia, my foot...

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:26.151
Oh my, is something the matter?

00:10:26.251 --> 00:10:28.890
[Natsume] My foot is...
(gasp of relief)

00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:31.730
[Alexia] Oh my!
Is something the matter?

00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:33.700
You little...

00:10:34.201 --> 00:10:36.338
(crowd cheering)

00:10:36.439 --> 00:10:38.108
(Rose giggling)

00:10:41.984 --> 00:10:43.787
[Nelson] The time has come!

00:10:43.887 --> 00:10:47.695
Now, Great and Divine Beatrix,
please hear our humble prayer!

00:10:47.795 --> 00:10:52.437
Allow the warriors gathered
here today to undergo
your supreme trial!

00:10:52.538 --> 00:10:54.543
(click)

00:10:54.643 --> 00:10:57.013
(dramatic music)
(crowd cheering)

00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:04.027
(light humming)

00:11:10.273 --> 00:11:14.314
And now, without further delay,
let the Goddess' Trial begin!

00:11:14.414 --> 00:11:16.753
(fighters cheering)

00:11:21.462 --> 00:11:23.800
(fireworks exploding)

00:11:30.347 --> 00:11:32.818
(crowd cheering)

00:11:32.918 --> 00:11:34.756
(gong sounds)

00:11:34.856 --> 00:11:36.793
[MC] Our first contender
is a challenger

00:11:36.893 --> 00:11:39.899
from the Oriana Kingdom,
Toppe Batterius!

00:11:39.999 --> 00:11:42.370
Did you know? If an ancient
warrior appears,

00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:44.308
he won't be able to leave
that dome of light

00:11:44.408 --> 00:11:46.747
until either the challenger
or the ancient warrior

00:11:46.847 --> 00:11:49.351
is down for the count.
Last year, somebody died!

00:11:49.452 --> 00:11:52.892
Seriously? Why would you pay
hundreds of thousands of zeni

00:11:52.992 --> 00:11:54.929
to potentially get
yourself killed?

00:11:55.029 --> 00:11:57.602
Because if you manage to beat
an ancient warrior,

00:11:57.702 --> 00:11:59.437
you get a commemorative medal!

00:11:59.538 --> 00:12:00.941
With one of those babies,

00:12:01.041 --> 00:12:03.479
you can go to any knight order
in any nation in the world

00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:04.949
and they'll hire you for sure!

00:12:05.049 --> 00:12:07.220
[red shirt] Wow, that IS
something to write home about!

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:09.926
[Kagenou] <i>I see. Thank you
for your perfect example</i>

00:12:10.026 --> 00:12:12.164
<i>of background character
exposition.</i>

00:12:12.264 --> 00:12:15.270
<i>But nevermind that.
I don't suppose I'll get to do</i>

00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:18.375
<i>anything Eminence-in-Shadowy
during this event.</i>

00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:20.547
O, ancient warrior!

00:12:20.647 --> 00:12:23.218
Hear my call and
answer my summons!

00:12:23.319 --> 00:12:25.456
(crowd cheering)

00:12:30.199 --> 00:12:32.403
(bell rings)
(crowd laughing)

00:12:33.306 --> 00:12:35.844
[MC] Now, from the
Midgar Knight Order,

00:12:35.945 --> 00:12:39.218
we have Neks Tinline!
(gong sounds)

00:12:39.318 --> 00:12:42.290
<i>I mean, it's such a big event.
It'd be a shame to just accept</i>

00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:44.896
<i>my background character status
and do nothing.</i>

00:12:44.996 --> 00:12:47.635
<i>I wanna, you know,
make a dashing entrance,</i>

00:12:47.735 --> 00:12:49.505
<i>show off my eminent powers,</i>

00:12:49.605 --> 00:12:53.045
<i>and have them all go,
"Who is that mysterious man?"</i>

00:12:53.145 --> 00:12:55.116
(bell rings)
(crowd laughing)

00:12:55.216 --> 00:12:57.689
[MC] Next from the
Laugus Vigilante Corps,

00:12:57.789 --> 00:13:00.493
Stihl-Aint Hapnin!
(gong sounds)

00:13:00.594 --> 00:13:03.701
[Kagenou] <i>If only they would
accept walk-in entries.</i>

00:13:03.801 --> 00:13:06.138
<i>I mean, I could say
"rules be damned"</i>

00:13:06.238 --> 00:13:08.375
<i>and jump into the
competition anyway,</i>

00:13:08.475 --> 00:13:11.315
<i>but I think I'd prefer to save
a juicy appearance like that</i>

00:13:11.415 --> 00:13:14.187
<i>for a more important and
appropriate scene.</i>

00:13:14.288 --> 00:13:15.857
<i>And is each fighter
only allowed</i>

00:13:15.957 --> 00:13:18.096
<i>one battle in this tournament?</i>

00:13:18.196 --> 00:13:20.433
<i>As Eminence in Shadow,
what I really wanna do</i>

00:13:20.534 --> 00:13:22.772
<i>is disguise myself as
a weakling nobody</i>

00:13:22.872 --> 00:13:26.078
<i>and win my way through under
the radar.</i>

00:13:26.178 --> 00:13:28.015
<i>Oh well, guess I'll just accept</i>

00:13:28.115 --> 00:13:30.520
<i>my role as background
character this time.</i>

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:32.991
(gong sounds)
(crowd cheering)

00:13:34.194 --> 00:13:37.668
[Kagenou] <i>Come to think of it,
I haven't seen Alpha.</i>

00:13:37.768 --> 00:13:40.106
(tense music)

00:13:56.305 --> 00:13:58.877
(bell rings)
(crowd rumbling)

00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:04.121
<i>I hope this will be over soon.</i>

00:14:04.221 --> 00:14:06.693
<i>After all that, it looks like
someone named Annerose</i>

00:14:06.793 --> 00:14:09.565
<i>is the only one who managed to
summon an ancient warrior.</i>

00:14:09.665 --> 00:14:12.739
[MC] Next from the Midgar
Academy for Dark Knights,

00:14:12.839 --> 00:14:14.107
Cid Kagenou!

00:14:14.208 --> 00:14:16.245
<i>Next is a guy named
Cid Kagenou.</i>

00:14:16.345 --> 00:14:18.984
<i>That is such a
background character name.</i>

00:14:19.084 --> 00:14:22.190
<i>Cid Kagen-
Wait!</i>

00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:25.263
So we have a student of the
Dark Knight Academy, do we?

00:14:25.363 --> 00:14:27.434
Then he must no doubt be quite
the skilled fighter

00:14:27.535 --> 00:14:28.504
to be chosen for this.

00:14:28.604 --> 00:14:31.241
Once we've traversed
the thorny path ahead,

00:14:31.341 --> 00:14:33.847
our contented future awaits us.

00:14:33.947 --> 00:14:35.182
I can hardly believe it!

00:14:35.282 --> 00:14:37.654
A student attempting
the Goddess' Trial?

00:14:37.754 --> 00:14:39.291
He must be so incredibly brave!

00:14:39.391 --> 00:14:41.128
[red shirt] Yeah! You can bet
he's one of the most

00:14:41.228 --> 00:14:42.865
popular kids
in the whole school!

00:14:42.965 --> 00:14:45.336
[green shirt]
We're not gonna wanna miss this!

00:14:45.436 --> 00:14:49.244
<i>Option one, resign myself
to fight in the Trial.</i>

00:14:49.344 --> 00:14:51.983
<i>But if a really powerful
ancient warrior pops out,</i>

00:14:52.083 --> 00:14:54.522
<i>everyone will find out that I
have eminent powers.</i>

00:14:54.622 --> 00:14:58.262
<i>They seem to match everyone's
level pretty accurately,
after all.</i>

00:14:58.362 --> 00:15:02.337
<i>Option two, run away.
That's a hard pass.</i>

00:15:02.437 --> 00:15:06.111
<i>They already know that
I'm a student at the
Dark Knight Academy.</i>

00:15:06.211 --> 00:15:08.416
<i>If the administrators find out
I incurred the wrath</i>

00:15:08.517 --> 00:15:11.556
<i>of the Divine Teachings,
I could get expelled.</i>

00:15:11.656 --> 00:15:13.358
<i>What would my sister say?</i>

00:15:14.696 --> 00:15:16.499
<i>Option three...</i>

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:18.002
(humming thoughtfully)

00:15:18.102 --> 00:15:21.876
[MC] Cid Kagenou! Can we take
this to mean you withdraw?

00:15:21.976 --> 00:15:23.647
[Nelson] He isn't coming out?

00:15:23.747 --> 00:15:28.155
No surprise, we do usually have
two or three a year who
get cold feet.

00:15:28.255 --> 00:15:30.627
(light humming)
(all gasping)

00:15:32.263 --> 00:15:34.400
What is that bright light?

00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:37.373
(light humming)

00:15:39.946 --> 00:15:41.248
(crowd gasping)

00:15:41.348 --> 00:15:44.856
What is this? We were not
planning to have a show.

00:15:44.956 --> 00:15:47.160
(gasps) Look!

00:15:47.962 --> 00:15:49.398
(gasps)

00:15:49.498 --> 00:15:50.568
(cape fluttering)

00:15:50.668 --> 00:15:52.070
[Nelson] What is that?

00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:54.207
[Natsume] It can't be!

00:15:54.307 --> 00:15:55.977
Shadow?!

00:15:56.980 --> 00:15:59.986
<i>Option three,
confuse the matter.</i>

00:16:00.086 --> 00:16:01.254
<i>By my calculations,</i>

00:16:01.354 --> 00:16:02.925
<i>no matter how intense
the fighting,</i>

00:16:03.025 --> 00:16:06.633
<i>confusion ensues
when a bomb goes off!</i>

00:16:06.733 --> 00:16:08.302
[Shadow] My name is Shadow.

00:16:08.402 --> 00:16:09.839
(clang)

00:16:09.939 --> 00:16:13.445
He who lurks in and
hunts the shadows.

00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:14.949
Shadow...

00:16:15.049 --> 00:16:17.554
Why on earth would he be here?

00:16:17.654 --> 00:16:19.324
Where could Cid be?

00:16:19.424 --> 00:16:21.963
(tense music)

00:16:22.063 --> 00:16:23.465
[Nelson] Shadow...

00:16:23.566 --> 00:16:26.539
The filthy rat that's been
skittering around at our feet.

00:16:26.639 --> 00:16:28.910
You've overestimated your
power, young man,

00:16:29.011 --> 00:16:31.583
and will soon rue
that foolishness.

00:16:31.683 --> 00:16:34.020
(tense music)

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:42.938
Ancient memories lie slumbering
within the Sanctuary.

00:16:43.039 --> 00:16:46.746
This night,
we shall set them free!

00:16:46.847 --> 00:16:49.183
(light humming)

00:16:51.556 --> 00:16:53.159
[Nelson] Huh?

00:16:53.259 --> 00:16:55.764
(electrical discharge)

00:16:55.864 --> 00:16:59.605
How's this happening? I did not
activate anything like this!

00:17:02.678 --> 00:17:05.984
[Alexia] An ancient warrior
is answering his call.

00:17:06.084 --> 00:17:09.157
Well, well, this turned into
a pretty big deal.

00:17:14.267 --> 00:17:16.572
(tense music)

00:17:29.532 --> 00:17:32.270
It can't be!
There is just no way!

00:17:32.370 --> 00:17:34.708
[Natsume]
Aurora, the Witch of Calamity.

00:17:34.808 --> 00:17:35.845
Huh?

00:17:35.945 --> 00:17:38.850
Miss Natsume, who is Aurora?

00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:41.121
Aurora, the Witch of Calamity...

00:17:41.221 --> 00:17:43.560
She once rained chaos
and destruction

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:45.263
down upon our world.

00:17:45.363 --> 00:17:46.966
I've never heard of her.

00:17:47.066 --> 00:17:49.070
And how is it that you
know about her?

00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:51.441
It comes from being an author,
of course.

00:17:51.542 --> 00:17:53.746
That being said,
through the ages,

00:17:53.846 --> 00:17:56.318
they have called
Aurora the Witch of Calamity.

00:17:56.418 --> 00:17:58.089
But as to what chaos she caused

00:17:58.189 --> 00:18:00.493
or destruction she
rained down upon us,

00:18:00.594 --> 00:18:03.332
there are no records left
that describe it.

00:18:03.432 --> 00:18:05.136
Dear Archbishop...
(Nelson gasps)

00:18:05.236 --> 00:18:06.773
If you would be so kind,

00:18:06.873 --> 00:18:09.712
please tell me more about the
Witch of Calamity?
(boing boing)

00:18:09.812 --> 00:18:12.083
Of course, I'd be glad to.

00:18:12.183 --> 00:18:13.285
[Nelson] Yes, indeed.
(both sigh)

00:18:13.385 --> 00:18:15.123
It is only to be expected

00:18:15.223 --> 00:18:17.293
that Your Highnesses
wouldn't have heard of her.

00:18:17.393 --> 00:18:21.101
In fact, I'm quite surprised
that Miss Natsume recognizes
her.

00:18:21.201 --> 00:18:22.771
After all, even in the Church,

00:18:22.871 --> 00:18:26.613
the name Aurora is known only
to a very select few.

00:18:26.713 --> 00:18:30.219
Still, this Shadow person
is rather unfortunate.

00:18:30.319 --> 00:18:32.625
I can hardly believe anyone
would summon Aurora.

00:18:32.725 --> 00:18:36.364
She was known as the most
powerful witch in all of
history.

00:18:36.464 --> 00:18:38.201
A lowly bandit such as him

00:18:38.302 --> 00:18:41.041
will be utterly helpless
against her.

00:18:41.141 --> 00:18:43.479
I'm not so sure.
[Nelson] Huh?

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:45.984
If the Goddess' Trial
summoned this Aurora woman

00:18:46.084 --> 00:18:47.955
as an appropriate opponent
for Shadow,

00:18:48.055 --> 00:18:49.625
that can only mean one thing.

00:18:49.726 --> 00:18:52.564
It means that Shadow's powers
have reached the same level

00:18:52.664 --> 00:18:55.002
as one who destroyed the world.

00:18:55.103 --> 00:18:57.641
I doubt this will be
over so quickly.

00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:03.285
[Kagenou]
<i>She feels the same way I do.</i>

00:19:03.385 --> 00:19:05.356
<i>A battle is a conversation.</i>

00:19:05.456 --> 00:19:07.493
<i>The shifting of
a sword's point...</i>

00:19:07.594 --> 00:19:09.799
<i>The movement of one's gaze...</i>

00:19:09.899 --> 00:19:11.334
<i>The placement of the feet...</i>

00:19:11.434 --> 00:19:13.840
<i>All of them reflect
your opponent's will.</i>

00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:16.311
(force whooshing)
(all gasping)

00:19:20.621 --> 00:19:23.358
[Kagenou]
<i>We read those cues to give
each other better responses,</i>

00:19:23.459 --> 00:19:25.664
<i>back and forth,
again and again.</i>

00:19:25.764 --> 00:19:28.435
<i>This is the real
essence of battle.</i>

00:19:29.705 --> 00:19:32.944
[Nelson] Well, it appears that
my prediction was right.

00:19:33.713 --> 00:19:35.383
(force whooshing)

00:19:35.483 --> 00:19:37.854
[Rose] That's an
ancient battle technique.

00:19:37.954 --> 00:19:40.259
[Nelson] He's more persistent
than I expected,

00:19:40.359 --> 00:19:43.165
but I think it's clear
that he's outmatched.

00:19:43.265 --> 00:19:44.635
But not a single one
of her spears

00:19:44.735 --> 00:19:47.240
has come close to hitting him.
[Alexia] Huh?

00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:50.547
Isn't that correct, dear
Princess Alexia?

00:19:51.247 --> 00:19:52.551
Yes, you're correct.

00:19:52.651 --> 00:19:55.757
That woman is strong,
and no ordinary Dark Knight

00:19:55.857 --> 00:19:58.362
could ever manage
against her attacks.

00:19:58.462 --> 00:20:01.301
But Shadow is still
only watching.

00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:05.243
[Kagenou] <i>I'm loving this,
my violet-eyed opponent.</i>

00:20:05.343 --> 00:20:07.514
<i>Actually,
let me call you Violet,</i>

00:20:07.614 --> 00:20:09.183
<i>with my deepest affections.</i>

00:20:09.284 --> 00:20:11.622
(dramatic music)

00:20:15.697 --> 00:20:18.402
<i>I haven't been able to have a
decent conversation like this</i>

00:20:18.503 --> 00:20:20.808
<i>in a very long time.</i>

00:20:20.908 --> 00:20:22.678
<i>Which is why, dear Violet,</i>

00:20:22.778 --> 00:20:25.315
<i>I'm so happy I get
to speak with you.</i>

00:20:25.416 --> 00:20:27.754
(dramatic music)

00:20:30.293 --> 00:20:32.664
<i>That's also how I know...</i>

00:20:33.867 --> 00:20:35.970
(chains rattling)

00:20:36.806 --> 00:20:38.341
<i>It's too bad...</i>

00:20:41.148 --> 00:20:43.485
(sword ringing)

00:20:47.359 --> 00:20:49.397
(schwing)

00:20:52.336 --> 00:20:54.675
(blood splattering)

00:20:57.380 --> 00:21:00.285
I wish I could have fought you
at full strength.

00:21:02.424 --> 00:21:04.761
(light chiming)

00:21:10.005 --> 00:21:11.977
[Rose] He won.

00:21:12.077 --> 00:21:14.013
[Alexia] Yes, he did.

00:21:14.113 --> 00:21:15.083
[Nelson] Impossible!

00:21:15.183 --> 00:21:17.520
You're saying that she lost?

00:21:17.621 --> 00:21:20.960
But Aurora was doing all of the
fighting on the offensive!

00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:24.000
(ground rumbling)
(both gasp)

00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:25.871
(glass cracking)
(all gasp)

00:21:25.971 --> 00:21:27.306
What the...

00:21:27.407 --> 00:21:30.146
(dramatic music)

00:21:30.246 --> 00:21:32.584
(glass shattering)

00:21:34.522 --> 00:21:36.859
(electrical discharge)

00:21:38.062 --> 00:21:40.399
(dramatic music)

00:22:05.617 --> 00:22:08.589
The Sanctuary
answered his call.

00:22:09.491 --> 00:22:12.998
So, Shadow,
it is true that you're...

00:22:21.181 --> 00:22:23.519
(ENDING THEME)
