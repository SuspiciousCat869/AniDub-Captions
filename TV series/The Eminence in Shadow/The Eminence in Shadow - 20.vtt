WEBVTT

00:00:01.135 --> 00:00:03.439
(rain falling)

00:00:37.241 --> 00:00:39.579
(glass shattering)

00:00:41.416 --> 00:00:43.787
(wind whooshing)
(intense music)

00:00:58.918 --> 00:01:00.420
(gasps)

00:01:01.824 --> 00:01:02.993
[Iris] That's...

00:01:03.093 --> 00:01:04.963
[Rose] They call themselves
Shadow Garden.

00:01:05.063 --> 00:01:06.366
[Alpha] We are Shadow Garden,

00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:08.303
and you will
stay out of our way.

00:01:08.403 --> 00:01:10.808
[Alexia]
Iris, Shadow's powers...

00:01:12.111 --> 00:01:13.380
What's the matter?

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.518
We're just getting started.

00:01:16.285 --> 00:01:17.756
[Iris] You...

00:01:17.856 --> 00:01:19.893
It was you!
(swords clash)

00:01:19.993 --> 00:01:22.331
(people screaming)

00:01:23.901 --> 00:01:26.439
Shadow!

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:27.775
(swords clash)

00:01:27.876 --> 00:01:30.213
(music building)

00:01:40.167 --> 00:01:42.038
(thunder rumbling)

00:01:42.138 --> 00:01:43.406
[spectators]
What the blazes just happened?

00:01:43.507 --> 00:01:44.643
-They're saying
a fight broke out.

00:01:44.743 --> 00:01:46.813
-This is obviously
a terrorist attack.

00:01:46.913 --> 00:01:49.419
-Is His Majesty all right?

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.924
[knight] We've taken all the
guests of honor to safety,

00:01:52.024 --> 00:01:53.627
but I seriously doubt
that this battle

00:01:53.727 --> 00:01:55.965
will remain inside the
confines of the stadium.

00:01:56.065 --> 00:02:00.240
[Midgar] Then I may have to
consider declaring martial law.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.344
Where is Perv Asshat currently?

00:02:02.444 --> 00:02:05.350
He is traveling to the outskirts
of the Royal Capital.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:06.821
Judging from his route,

00:02:06.921 --> 00:02:09.258
we believe he intends to return
to the Oriana Kingdom

00:02:09.358 --> 00:02:11.229
without stopping at the
embassy.

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:13.233
[Midgar]
What of the body of King Geerk?

00:02:13.333 --> 00:02:15.304
[official]
It is safely in our custody.

00:02:15.404 --> 00:02:18.377
[Midgar] Treat it with the
utmost care and respect.

00:02:18.477 --> 00:02:20.147
When returning it to Oriana,

00:02:20.247 --> 00:02:22.351
make sure to go through
Marquis Grant.

00:02:22.451 --> 00:02:24.690
[official] A leader in the
anti-chancellor faction?

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.196
But Your Majesty, wouldn't that
risk provoking a civil war?

00:02:28.296 --> 00:02:31.102
[Midgar] Our kingdom will need
time to fortify itself.

00:02:31.202 --> 00:02:32.872
The darkness that has been
lurking in the shadows

00:02:32.972 --> 00:02:37.281
of history since ancient times
has taken on a deeper hue.

00:02:37.381 --> 00:02:39.385
We'd be foolish
to be unprepared,

00:02:39.485 --> 00:02:42.258
and risk being
swallowed up inside it.

00:02:42.358 --> 00:02:44.729
(thunder booming)
(hard rain falling)

00:02:45.798 --> 00:02:47.769
(swords clashing)

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:02.632
(gasps)

00:03:04.936 --> 00:03:06.606
(swords clash)

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.329
(gasps)

00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:21.837
(Beatrix grunting)

00:03:23.974 --> 00:03:25.477
(gasps)

00:03:30.622 --> 00:03:33.694
You were standing right in
front of me.

00:03:33.794 --> 00:03:37.836
But just as I can't focus
my attention on every
single drop of rain,

00:03:37.936 --> 00:03:41.843
you shift, and my focus can't
tell when you move.

00:03:42.411 --> 00:03:44.048
What's the matter?

00:03:44.148 --> 00:03:46.318
We're just getting started.

00:03:47.354 --> 00:03:49.358
One moment, please.

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.569
I would like to
join this contest.

00:03:56.707 --> 00:03:58.309
A mythril blade?

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:00.047
Ancient runes?

00:04:00.147 --> 00:04:01.650
An artifact?

00:04:01.751 --> 00:04:04.288
[Iris]
Do you think it's underhanded?

00:04:07.295 --> 00:04:08.496
No, not at all.

00:04:08.597 --> 00:04:11.035
But to think you would
lean on that crutch...

00:04:11.135 --> 00:04:13.473
(growls)

00:04:14.241 --> 00:04:15.377
Shut up!

00:04:15.477 --> 00:04:17.815
(flames whooshing)

00:04:21.222 --> 00:04:23.560
(hyaaah)

00:04:29.438 --> 00:04:31.810
(flames whooshing)
(wind whistling)

00:04:36.753 --> 00:04:39.793
[Shadow] I'll give you points
for the stunning visuals.

00:04:39.893 --> 00:04:42.632
It might be just the thing for
a festival spectacular.

00:04:42.732 --> 00:04:45.303
(swords clashing)
(tense music)

00:04:46.305 --> 00:04:48.577
(swords clashing)

00:04:48.677 --> 00:04:49.979
(growls)

00:04:51.015 --> 00:04:53.921
What idiot would do that
in the middle of town?

00:04:55.356 --> 00:04:56.392
And never mind that.

00:04:56.492 --> 00:04:58.864
Where did that boy
wander off to?

00:04:59.399 --> 00:05:01.703
(dramatic music)

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:07.314
I've escaped, but where am
I supposed to go from here?

00:05:07.414 --> 00:05:09.753
Do I go back to the capital?

00:05:09.853 --> 00:05:12.859
Do I join up with the
anti-Perv resistance?

00:05:12.959 --> 00:05:15.330
[Alpha] It seems to me
that you have two choices.

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:16.933
(gasps)

00:05:20.006 --> 00:05:22.344
(swords clashing)

00:05:31.429 --> 00:05:33.466
[Iris] (hyaaah)

00:05:35.805 --> 00:05:37.942
(explosion)

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.948
(rubble clattering)

00:05:45.057 --> 00:05:47.596
(swords clashing)

00:05:47.696 --> 00:05:49.431
What?

00:05:49.532 --> 00:05:52.371
I knew it from the beginning.

00:05:52.471 --> 00:05:54.910
She has real potential!

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:57.147
(swords clashing)

00:05:59.519 --> 00:06:01.856
(electricity crackling)

00:06:02.792 --> 00:06:05.163
(explosions)
(people screaming)

00:06:07.602 --> 00:06:09.906
(train chugging)

00:06:14.916 --> 00:06:16.586
(hyaaah)

00:06:22.732 --> 00:06:25.270
All right, let's continue.

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:28.342
And do try not to fall off,
won't you?

00:06:28.443 --> 00:06:29.846
(rain pattering)

00:06:29.946 --> 00:06:32.117
[Rose] What do you mean
I have two choices?

00:06:32.217 --> 00:06:35.290
[Alpha] The first is to
continue your fight alone.

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:37.361
The other is to
fight by OUR side

00:06:37.461 --> 00:06:39.532
as a member of Shadow Garden.

00:06:40.434 --> 00:06:42.705
Now, choose.

00:06:44.308 --> 00:06:45.778
First, tell me this.

00:06:45.878 --> 00:06:49.385
Do you have any intention of
saving the Oriana Kingdom?

00:06:49.485 --> 00:06:52.626
We will do nothing to assist
you as you are now.

00:06:52.726 --> 00:06:54.696
If you wish to
save your kingdom,

00:06:54.796 --> 00:06:56.432
you must show us your worth.

00:06:56.534 --> 00:06:57.969
[Rose] My worth?

00:06:58.069 --> 00:07:01.876
[Alpha] Your worth, and the
worth of the Oriana Kingdom.

00:07:04.181 --> 00:07:07.955
Does the Oriana Kingdom have
any chance at all?

00:07:08.055 --> 00:07:10.059
That depends on you.

00:07:17.676 --> 00:07:20.013
(rain falling harder)

00:07:25.825 --> 00:07:28.664
[Rose] Please forgive me,
Father, for what I must do.

00:07:30.801 --> 00:07:33.205
I pledge to fight alongside you.

00:07:44.563 --> 00:07:46.933
(intense music)
(train chugging)

00:07:50.574 --> 00:07:51.610
[Iris] Who are you?

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:54.015
For the love of God,
who are you?!

00:07:54.115 --> 00:07:55.383
I am Shadow.

00:07:55.483 --> 00:07:58.356
This name and this form that
stands before you are my truth.

00:07:58.456 --> 00:08:00.160
[Mundane] Everything else
is just a fanciful

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.130
and fabricated fiction.

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:03.900
(growls)

00:08:07.775 --> 00:08:11.549
My name is Beatrix.
Have we met somewhere before?

00:08:11.649 --> 00:08:12.718
Who knows?

00:08:12.818 --> 00:08:16.526
I never forget
a powerful opponent.

00:08:16.626 --> 00:08:19.397
But are you ladies worth
keeping in my memory?

00:08:19.498 --> 00:08:21.803
(dramatic music)

00:08:23.507 --> 00:08:26.547
Allow me to show you the
witch's secret art.

00:08:26.647 --> 00:08:28.984
(water whooshing)

00:08:31.422 --> 00:08:32.491
A vampire attack?

00:08:32.592 --> 00:08:34.662
So what, anything goes?

00:08:35.898 --> 00:08:38.671
(hyaaah)
(flames whoosh)

00:08:38.771 --> 00:08:41.108
(flames whooshing)

00:08:43.145 --> 00:08:46.352
(somber music)

00:08:46.452 --> 00:08:49.892
Wow, magic doesn't flow as well
through ordinary water.

00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:56.840
[citizens]
What in the world is happening?

00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:59.345
-Someone fell in the river.

00:08:59.445 --> 00:09:01.783
(swords clashing)

00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:10.868
(swords clashing)

00:09:12.471 --> 00:09:14.307
Damn you, Shadow!

00:09:20.453 --> 00:09:21.757
(chuckles)

00:09:21.857 --> 00:09:24.763
I hope to see you again,
Mundane.

00:09:24.863 --> 00:09:27.233
(explosions)
(dramatic music)

00:09:38.256 --> 00:09:39.526
(swords clash)

00:09:39.626 --> 00:09:41.161
Not this time.

00:09:41.262 --> 00:09:42.532
Very well done.

00:09:42.632 --> 00:09:45.103
In sword skill, you're
almost as good as we are.

00:09:45.203 --> 00:09:46.271
But in all honesty,

00:09:46.371 --> 00:09:49.445
your use of magic leaves
so much to be desired.

00:09:49.546 --> 00:09:52.117
Allow me to teach you
the correct way.

00:09:52.217 --> 00:09:54.488
(flames whooshing)

00:09:54.589 --> 00:09:56.291
(hyaaah)

00:10:01.068 --> 00:10:03.974
[Shadow] Are both of these
women wild animals?

00:10:06.479 --> 00:10:08.315
[Beatrix] (gasps)

00:10:11.188 --> 00:10:14.762
I cannot be defeated with
borrowed strength.

00:10:17.334 --> 00:10:22.210
Beatrix,
I swear I will immobilize him
if it costs me my life.

00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:25.049
When I do, take him down!

00:10:26.452 --> 00:10:27.922
(thunder rumbles)

00:10:28.022 --> 00:10:31.128
Very well, then.
Try and oppose me.

00:10:31.228 --> 00:10:33.365
(explosion)

00:10:34.502 --> 00:10:37.307
(hyaaah)
(haunting choral music)

00:10:37.407 --> 00:10:39.378
(hyaaah)
(flames whooshing)

00:10:39.478 --> 00:10:41.816
(hyaaah)

00:10:44.589 --> 00:10:46.091
(hyaaah)

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:49.031
[Shadow] Amateur.

00:10:49.131 --> 00:10:51.368
(electrical discharge)
(dramatic music)

00:11:05.196 --> 00:11:06.866
(groaning)

00:11:09.639 --> 00:11:11.577
(rock rumbling)

00:11:11.677 --> 00:11:14.014
(screaming)

00:11:16.385 --> 00:11:18.723
(triumphant music)

00:11:20.628 --> 00:11:22.965
(thunder booming)

00:11:28.644 --> 00:11:31.716
[Iris] (groaning) Come back...

00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:34.956
(Iris panting)

00:11:35.056 --> 00:11:40.232
[Iris] You have wrought havoc
all across the capital.

00:11:41.468 --> 00:11:44.474
Do you really think I'll let
you get away with this?!

00:11:44.576 --> 00:11:48.550
By now, every knight in the
city will have been mobilized.

00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:50.220
Everyone in the capital,

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:54.595
everyone in the entire kingdom
of Midgar is your enemy!

00:11:54.696 --> 00:11:57.067
There's nowhere left
for you to run!

00:11:57.167 --> 00:11:59.739
(thunder booms)
(dramatic music)

00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:03.947
(rain falling steadily)

00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:08.724
(Shadow chuckling)

00:12:08.824 --> 00:12:11.161
(laughter building)

00:12:17.509 --> 00:12:19.845
(laughing maniacally)

00:12:32.505 --> 00:12:34.007
(Shadow sighs)

00:12:34.842 --> 00:12:36.512
Run away?

00:12:37.915 --> 00:12:39.785
Who's running?

00:12:40.286 --> 00:12:41.956
Running where?

00:12:42.792 --> 00:12:44.863
WHY WOULD I RUN?!

00:12:44.963 --> 00:12:47.300
(energy exploding)

00:12:51.409 --> 00:12:53.546
(energy humming)

00:12:55.584 --> 00:12:57.053
What is this?

00:12:57.153 --> 00:12:59.592
[Iris] No, it can't be.

00:12:59.692 --> 00:13:01.361
It's too...

00:13:02.565 --> 00:13:04.902
(eerie music)

00:13:07.074 --> 00:13:09.411
Play time is now over.

00:13:09.513 --> 00:13:11.849
(thunder booms)

00:13:13.052 --> 00:13:15.423
(energy humming)
(rain pattering)

00:13:23.439 --> 00:13:25.744
(swoosh)

00:13:25.844 --> 00:13:28.182
Doing this isn't going
to help anything.

00:13:28.282 --> 00:13:30.353
Maybe that's what
you'll tell me.

00:13:31.488 --> 00:13:33.459
But I will not stop.

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:35.597
I will continue down this path.

00:13:35.697 --> 00:13:39.505
Even if I were to die now,
and then end up reborn...

00:13:40.941 --> 00:13:42.210
I know...

00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:43.980
(swoosh)

00:13:47.387 --> 00:13:50.426
I will choose
the same path again.

00:13:55.871 --> 00:13:58.242
(Shadow laughing)
(haunting choral music)

00:14:02.851 --> 00:14:06.859
Now observe, ladies, and
witness for yourselves

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:11.168
my earth-shattering,
my sky-rending,

00:14:11.268 --> 00:14:17.848
supremely ultimate, almighty,
and unparalleled attack!

00:14:17.948 --> 00:14:20.319
(energy whooshing)
(haunting music)

00:14:21.523 --> 00:14:23.660
[Shadow] I...

00:14:24.595 --> 00:14:27.400
am!

00:14:29.973 --> 00:14:32.310
(video whirring)

00:14:39.626 --> 00:14:41.963
(explosion)

00:14:43.534 --> 00:14:47.306
[Kagenou] <i>I mean, this time it
really is just for show.</i>

00:14:51.917 --> 00:14:53.252
(huh)

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:55.322
(gasps)

00:15:01.168 --> 00:15:03.172
He just went away.

00:15:04.742 --> 00:15:07.213
(growls)

00:15:07.313 --> 00:15:09.685
(screaming)
(energy crackling)

00:15:13.526 --> 00:15:15.664
(sobbing)

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.875
[Sherry] "Shadow, the demon who
appeared in the Royal Capital,

00:15:37.975 --> 00:15:42.050
was repelled by Princess Iris
and Beatrix, the Goddess
of War."

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:46.358
"But no clues have been found
in regard to the whereabouts
of Princess Rose,

00:15:46.458 --> 00:15:50.333
now guilty of killing her
father, King Geerk of Oriana."

00:15:50.433 --> 00:15:54.040
"Much remains unknown about the
secret society Shadow Garden

00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:56.412
that aligns itself
with the demon."

00:15:56.513 --> 00:15:58.683
"The Knight Order has
rallied all of its forces

00:15:58.784 --> 00:16:02.456
to apprehend the man they see
as the principal offender...

00:16:03.794 --> 00:16:05.462
...Shadow."

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:11.007
I swear I will,
with all my heart.

00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:13.646
(sobbing laugh)

00:16:17.154 --> 00:16:20.727
How could you let this happen?
Disgraceful.

00:16:20.827 --> 00:16:23.833
I'm sorry, please forgive me.

00:16:23.934 --> 00:16:26.171
But sir,
as long as the royal family

00:16:26.271 --> 00:16:27.508
is in the Cult's clutches,

00:16:27.608 --> 00:16:30.747
the girl can't just disappear
without a trace.

00:16:30.847 --> 00:16:33.252
Now that Oriana has
lost its king,

00:16:33.352 --> 00:16:35.724
the nation will be in turmoil.

00:16:35.824 --> 00:16:37.962
She won't be able
to ignore that.

00:16:38.062 --> 00:16:39.966
She's sure to come back.

00:16:40.066 --> 00:16:41.737
And when she does-

00:16:41.837 --> 00:16:43.072
I hope you are right.

00:16:43.172 --> 00:16:47.446
Try not to disappoint me
yet again, Perv Asshat.

00:16:47.548 --> 00:16:49.050
[Perv] Yes, sir.

00:16:50.688 --> 00:16:52.925
[Goldy] You can't expect me to
stay in this lousy city.

00:16:53.026 --> 00:16:54.194
I'm out of here.

00:16:54.294 --> 00:16:56.064
[Quinton] Oh yeah?
So you're skipping town.

00:16:56.164 --> 00:16:57.801
Where could you
possibly go next?

00:16:57.901 --> 00:17:00.239
[Goldy] I'm not skipping town,
I'm moving on, and...

00:17:00.339 --> 00:17:02.678
Honestly, you're better off
not obsessing over it.

00:17:02.779 --> 00:17:06.185
There are many entities that
mortals cannot hope to rival.

00:17:06.285 --> 00:17:08.757
What's more,
you are still very young, so-

00:17:08.857 --> 00:17:10.360
[Iris] Don't worry.

00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:14.133
The thing is, I'm not
capable of staying still.

00:17:15.002 --> 00:17:17.006
I understand.

00:17:17.107 --> 00:17:18.776
(bell clanging)

00:17:18.877 --> 00:17:21.214
(steam hissing)

00:17:22.818 --> 00:17:25.924
(whistle toots)
(train chugging)

00:17:26.025 --> 00:17:28.529
I never found
who I was looking for.

00:17:29.364 --> 00:17:32.203
Nothing really
worked out for me.

00:17:33.405 --> 00:17:37.013
But there were some nice things.

00:17:37.113 --> 00:17:41.055
I just have to take my time,
and keep trying.

00:17:41.155 --> 00:17:42.457
So as you can see,

00:17:42.558 --> 00:17:44.962
our plan is to blue sky
several points of concern,

00:17:45.062 --> 00:17:46.833
and commit to
maximizing our benefits

00:17:46.933 --> 00:17:48.268
using a limited budget.

00:17:48.368 --> 00:17:50.172
The Knight Order is
hopelessly and frantically

00:17:50.272 --> 00:17:51.676
searching for Lord Shadow.

00:17:51.776 --> 00:17:54.481
That is precisely what
Lord Shadow wanted.

00:17:54.582 --> 00:17:56.752
He's brilliantly
acting as a decoy

00:17:56.852 --> 00:17:58.790
to distract the Midgar Kingdom.

00:17:58.891 --> 00:18:02.364
This is to prevent them from
getting involved with Oriana.

00:18:02.464 --> 00:18:04.668
Are we in full communication
with the other side?

00:18:04.768 --> 00:18:08.275
[Nu] Yes, Lady Eta has
worked that all out.
[Eta] Dot, dash, dash...

00:18:08.375 --> 00:18:10.280
[Beta] Worked it all out?
[Eta] Dot, dot, dash...

00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:13.218
Perhaps we should
move up the rendezvous.

00:18:13.319 --> 00:18:16.458
We have to do our absolute
best work ever for Lord Shadow.

00:18:16.559 --> 00:18:17.728
Agreed!

00:18:17.828 --> 00:18:20.232
All necessary preparations are
complete, Lady Epsilon.

00:18:20.332 --> 00:18:22.871
HEEEY, BOOOSS!

00:18:22.971 --> 00:18:25.878
[Beta] Lord Shadow is actively
involving himself now.

00:18:25.978 --> 00:18:27.615
Let us hurry to tie up
the loose ends.

00:18:27.715 --> 00:18:29.618
[Nu] We'll send more personnel
to investigate

00:18:29.718 --> 00:18:31.923
and keep a close eye on the
major corporate alliance.
(Delta laughing)

00:18:32.023 --> 00:18:34.963
[students]
How long are we gonna be using
temporary school buildings?

00:18:35.063 --> 00:18:36.533
-Hey, have you heard?

00:18:36.633 --> 00:18:38.468
The school reconstruction is
getting funding from Mitsugoshi.

00:18:38.569 --> 00:18:41.074
-Do you think we'll get
new uniforms along with
the new building?

00:18:41.174 --> 00:18:43.045
Oh hey,
whatever happened to Skel?

00:18:43.145 --> 00:18:44.414
I'm not really sure.

00:18:44.515 --> 00:18:46.619
He said something about
taking a long-term job.

00:18:46.719 --> 00:18:49.124
[Cid] But the new school term
just started.

00:18:49.224 --> 00:18:51.261
Damn it all!
When the hell am I ever gonna

00:18:51.362 --> 00:18:52.732
get off this boat
and back on land?

00:18:52.832 --> 00:18:54.400
[fisherman]
Pay attention, you greenhorn!

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:55.704
Something's got your line!

00:18:55.804 --> 00:18:58.042
[Skel] Ah, I'm sorry, sir,
I'm really sorry!

00:18:58.142 --> 00:18:59.912
I promise I'll
pay more attention!

00:19:00.012 --> 00:19:02.083
I feel a storm is brewing.
(splash)

00:19:02.183 --> 00:19:03.553
[Po] But forget Skel,

00:19:03.653 --> 00:19:06.058
I can't believe what happened
at the Bushin Festival.

00:19:06.158 --> 00:19:08.129
[Cid] What happened?
[Po] You know!

00:19:08.229 --> 00:19:10.066
The Demon Shadow!

00:19:10.166 --> 00:19:11.602
Demon Shadow?

00:19:11.703 --> 00:19:13.973
[Po] I only saw it on my way
back from visiting my family,

00:19:14.073 --> 00:19:17.782
but there was that glow of
a magical energy covering
the whole capital.

00:19:17.882 --> 00:19:19.150
It was terrifying,

00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:21.321
like the gates of Hell
had just sprung open.

00:19:21.422 --> 00:19:24.294
Oh man,
I'm so sad I was outside it.

00:19:24.394 --> 00:19:25.698
I wish I'd been in the city.

00:19:25.798 --> 00:19:27.500
All those frightened
damsels in distress...

00:19:27.601 --> 00:19:30.405
[Cid] I guess I was
a little too conspicuous.

00:19:30.507 --> 00:19:33.279
[Po]
I'd do this with 'em, and that.

00:19:33.379 --> 00:19:36.151
[Cid] I need to keep things
more in the shadows.

00:19:36.252 --> 00:19:38.589
(birds chirping)

00:19:40.059 --> 00:19:43.198
[Father] So you see, since
Claire DID win the championship,

00:19:43.298 --> 00:19:44.535
we should celebrate.

00:19:44.635 --> 00:19:47.607
[Mother] Listen to you,
such a caring father.

00:19:47.707 --> 00:19:50.079
Baron Kagenou's domain...
(argument continues)

00:19:50.179 --> 00:19:51.716
[Father]
But dear, you know him.

00:19:51.816 --> 00:19:53.586
[Rose] Kagenou...
[Father] He's as shamelesss
as his mother!

00:19:53.686 --> 00:19:55.757
[Mother] Did you say something,
Baldy? (loud slap)

00:19:55.857 --> 00:19:57.359
[Father] I'm sorry!

00:19:59.665 --> 00:20:01.536
[Alpha]
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:20:01.636 --> 00:20:03.706
From here on out,
we go by foot.

00:20:03.806 --> 00:20:06.244
A Dark Knight should be able
to make it by nightfall.

00:20:06.344 --> 00:20:08.215
[Rose] By nightfall?
Starting now?

00:20:08.315 --> 00:20:11.421
[Alpha]
Past that mountain, through
the Therianthrope Territory,

00:20:11.522 --> 00:20:13.291
and deeper into the woods.

00:20:13.392 --> 00:20:17.067
[Rose] So magical beasts
infest this region?
(wind whistling mournfully)

00:20:17.167 --> 00:20:21.876
[Alpha]
When he visited these mountains,
he battled the Mist Dragon.

00:20:21.976 --> 00:20:24.080
What happened?

00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:25.717
After he defeated the dragon,

00:20:25.817 --> 00:20:27.486
he was dubbed ruler
of this realm,

00:20:27.588 --> 00:20:30.126
and then bathed
in dragon's breath.

00:20:30.226 --> 00:20:32.564
(wind whistling mournfully)

00:20:34.568 --> 00:20:36.305
("Moonlight Sonata")

00:20:36.405 --> 00:20:37.608
[Rose] Is this...

00:20:37.708 --> 00:20:40.346
[Alpha] The ancient capital
of Alexandria,

00:20:40.446 --> 00:20:42.651
our base of operations.

00:20:43.886 --> 00:20:46.425
(fighters whooshing)

00:20:46.526 --> 00:20:49.397
(swords clashing)

00:20:49.498 --> 00:20:51.636
[Rose]
This is where Shadow Garden...

00:20:51.736 --> 00:20:53.405
(swords clash)

00:20:54.308 --> 00:20:56.444
[Alpha] Lambda?

00:20:56.545 --> 00:20:58.916
We have a new recruit,
please train her.

00:20:59.016 --> 00:21:00.086
[Lambda] Yes, Lady Alpha.

00:21:00.186 --> 00:21:02.023
The rest all depends on you.

00:21:02.123 --> 00:21:03.927
Show us your power.

00:21:04.027 --> 00:21:05.563
[Rose] Uh... Um...

00:21:05.663 --> 00:21:08.836
Number 664 and Number 665!

00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:10.172
Hmm?

00:21:10.272 --> 00:21:12.778
You called for us, ma'am?

00:21:12.878 --> 00:21:14.480
We have a new recruit.

00:21:14.581 --> 00:21:16.719
I am putting her in your squad.

00:21:17.721 --> 00:21:19.023
Number 666!

00:21:20.159 --> 00:21:21.328
While you're here,

00:21:21.428 --> 00:21:24.701
that number will be your name,
Number 666.

00:21:25.704 --> 00:21:27.306
(gasps)

00:21:27.406 --> 00:21:29.678
You are now nothing, a nobody.

00:21:29.778 --> 00:21:33.084
You will cast away your name,
clothing, everything,

00:21:33.185 --> 00:21:36.024
and you will become
a pure soldier.

00:21:36.124 --> 00:21:38.461
(sonata continues)

00:21:44.508 --> 00:21:46.377
(swords clash)

00:21:48.416 --> 00:21:49.885
(paper rustling)

00:21:49.985 --> 00:21:51.488
(liquid burbling)

00:21:51.589 --> 00:21:54.862
Was I not clear when I said
cast away everything?

00:21:57.834 --> 00:21:59.972
(crying)

00:22:02.010 --> 00:22:04.347
(wind whistling)

00:22:07.821 --> 00:22:09.958
(Rose sobbing)

00:22:10.894 --> 00:22:13.031
(sonata continues)

00:22:42.357 --> 00:22:44.662
I have achieved my purpose.

00:22:44.762 --> 00:22:47.267
Everything is as I wish it.

00:22:47.367 --> 00:22:49.671
I lurk in the darkness, yes,

00:22:49.771 --> 00:22:52.476
merely doing what must be done.

00:22:55.650 --> 00:22:58.756
The hour of awakening
is at hand.

00:22:58.856 --> 00:23:02.831
There is little time remaining,
only...

00:23:10.179 --> 00:23:12.517
(sonata ending)

00:23:26.011 --> 00:23:30.486
Yeah, I think I'm gonna do it
like that next time.

00:23:30.587 --> 00:23:32.724
(stretches)

00:23:32.824 --> 00:23:34.594
(chuckles)
