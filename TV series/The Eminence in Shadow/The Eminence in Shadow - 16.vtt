00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:03.339
(soft orchestral music)

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:05.277
[Alexia] What does that girl
think she's doing?

00:00:05.377 --> 00:00:07.114
[Natsume]
It appears that Princess Rose

00:00:07.214 --> 00:00:09.285
has fled to the north
of the Royal Capital.

00:00:09.385 --> 00:00:12.926
I suspect she has
not yet left the city.

00:00:13.026 --> 00:00:16.333
Apparently, the Oriana Kingdom
wants to handle it internally

00:00:16.433 --> 00:00:18.203
as a purely domestic matter.

00:00:18.303 --> 00:00:20.340
They have sent word
to the Midgar Kingdom

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.178
asking them not to interfere.

00:00:22.278 --> 00:00:24.717
[Alexia] I smell a rat.
[Natsume] Me too.

00:00:24.817 --> 00:00:27.889
Rose is not a foreign diplomat.
She is an exchange student,

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:31.362
so it would be more appropriate
to judge her by Midgar law.

00:00:31.462 --> 00:00:34.402
But if that were to happen,
it could have an adverse effect

00:00:34.503 --> 00:00:36.372
on relations between
the two kingdoms.

00:00:36.472 --> 00:00:40.414
Well, Father is sure to take
a wait and see attitude.

00:00:40.515 --> 00:00:42.251
His picture could be
in the dictionary

00:00:42.351 --> 00:00:43.554
under "ostrich policy."

00:00:43.654 --> 00:00:46.426
Princess Rose's fiance is
a Mr. Perv Asshat,

00:00:46.527 --> 00:00:50.033
the second son of an
Oriana Kingdom duke.

00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:52.371
If she is arrested on
charges of harming him,

00:00:52.471 --> 00:00:55.511
she will naturally be given
a harsh sentence.

00:00:55.612 --> 00:00:57.147
[Alexia]
She's royalty, so they won't

00:00:57.247 --> 00:00:59.686
give her the death penalty,
but...

00:00:59.786 --> 00:01:02.391
(tense music)

00:01:02.491 --> 00:01:04.629
(panting)

00:01:05.097 --> 00:01:07.000
(groans)

00:01:07.101 --> 00:01:09.405
(many footsteps)

00:01:15.886 --> 00:01:18.222
(OPENING THEME)

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.009
[Alexia] Anyway,

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:53.412
we'll want to find Rose
before Oriana does

00:02:53.514 --> 00:02:55.484
so we can hear
her side of the story.

00:02:55.585 --> 00:02:57.522
[Natsume]
I wouldn't be too hasty.

00:02:57.622 --> 00:02:59.125
Princess Rose hasn't told us

00:02:59.225 --> 00:03:01.129
anything at all
about this matter.

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:02.665
Your point is?

00:03:02.766 --> 00:03:05.337
[Natsume] I imagine she wanted
to avoid the possibility of

00:03:05.437 --> 00:03:08.242
our involvement leading to
trouble between the kingdoms.

00:03:08.342 --> 00:03:10.715
It may be wise to refrain
from acting rashly.

00:03:10.815 --> 00:03:12.384
[Alexia] You mean we
should abandon her?

00:03:12.484 --> 00:03:13.821
[Natsume]
No, I didn't say that.

00:03:13.921 --> 00:03:16.492
I meant we should consider
our next move carefully.

00:03:16.593 --> 00:03:18.096
[Alexia] What does that mean?

00:03:18.196 --> 00:03:22.739
Are you saying that I'm nothing
more than a thoughtless idiot?

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:25.410
If you have something
to say to me, just say it.

00:03:25.511 --> 00:03:27.315
No, I would never infer
that you were-

00:03:27.415 --> 00:03:29.720
Don't play all sweet and
innocent with me!

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.322
(gasps)

00:03:32.391 --> 00:03:34.395
[Natsume]
Pl-please don't kill me.

00:03:34.495 --> 00:03:37.268
[Alexia]
Your acting is SO obvious.

00:03:37.368 --> 00:03:39.171
(Natsume gasps)
(dramatic music)

00:03:39.272 --> 00:03:40.741
I'll murder you.

00:03:40.841 --> 00:03:42.678
(whimpers)

00:03:46.285 --> 00:03:47.722
Look, I totally get it,

00:03:47.823 --> 00:03:50.962
I know that Rose didn't want to
drag us into her problem.

00:03:51.062 --> 00:03:52.732
That's what's pissing me off.

00:03:52.833 --> 00:03:53.568
[Natsume] Right.

00:03:53.668 --> 00:03:56.506
But we are all sworn allies.

00:03:56.607 --> 00:03:58.276
Sure, we don't know
what's going on

00:03:58.376 --> 00:03:59.513
deep in each other's hearts,

00:03:59.613 --> 00:04:01.883
but we decided
to work as a team.

00:04:01.983 --> 00:04:03.052
Didn't we?

00:04:03.152 --> 00:04:04.355
[Natsume] Yes.

00:04:04.455 --> 00:04:06.392
[Alexia] In that case,
I can't abandon her.

00:04:06.492 --> 00:04:08.664
Of course,
I wouldn't abandon you either.

00:04:08.764 --> 00:04:10.433
(Alexia standing)

00:04:11.135 --> 00:04:12.705
Understand?

00:04:12.805 --> 00:04:14.710
[Natsume] Then I will gather
some more information

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.446
on Princess Rose.

00:04:16.547 --> 00:04:19.351
I've heard some unsavory rumors
about her fiance,

00:04:19.451 --> 00:04:21.523
so I will look into
those as well.

00:04:21.623 --> 00:04:24.361
I see you changed
your tune fast.

00:04:24.461 --> 00:04:27.502
I'll start by seeing if my
sister can give me advice.

00:04:27.602 --> 00:04:30.006
You be careful out there,
I guess.

00:04:30.106 --> 00:04:32.512
You do the same, Princess.

00:04:33.346 --> 00:04:35.851
Nothing fazes you, does it?

00:04:37.254 --> 00:04:39.425
(door closes)

00:04:39.526 --> 00:04:42.599
All right,
I'll just have to do what I can.

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:45.638
[Beta] You may feed her a little
more information on Perv Asshat

00:04:45.738 --> 00:04:48.076
and the Oriana Royal Family.

00:04:48.176 --> 00:04:49.445
Are you sure, my Lady?

00:04:49.546 --> 00:04:52.317
If she gets more information
she has to process,

00:04:52.417 --> 00:04:54.756
she will slow down and
take some time to think.

00:04:54.856 --> 00:04:56.660
We cannot afford
for the princess

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.964
to run headfirst into trouble.

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:01.503
Now, where is Rose?

00:05:01.603 --> 00:05:03.540
She appears to have made
it through the sewers

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.176
and into the underground ruins.

00:05:05.277 --> 00:05:06.914
They are a complex
series of tunnels

00:05:07.014 --> 00:05:09.418
and should be a perfect place
to go into hiding.

00:05:09.519 --> 00:05:11.590
[Beta] Continue to keep tabs
on her location,

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:13.694
even if it's
just a general area.

00:05:13.794 --> 00:05:14.963
Of course.

00:05:15.063 --> 00:05:16.332
"As she fled,

00:05:16.432 --> 00:05:18.336
there were several occasions
of her pressing

00:05:18.436 --> 00:05:20.406
her hand to her chest."

00:05:21.276 --> 00:05:23.180
(exciting orchestral music)

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:24.949

Yeah, I guess I have
a few elf friends.

[Cid] I mean...

00:07:06.687 --> 00:07:08.857
She should look a lot like me.

She's my late sister's

[Cid] Okay.

Do you know or have you known

[Cid] Hmm...
[woman] You do?

00:07:18.643 --> 00:07:22.718
Well, I can't really see your
face under that hood.

Yes, of course.

Yep.

So, Mundane Mann,
what do you make of him?

00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:16.946
Supposedly, his opponent
tripped and fell,

00:09:17.047 --> 00:09:19.185
but it didn't look like
luck to me.

00:09:19.285 --> 00:09:22.357
[Quinton]
Agreed. That punk did something.

00:09:22.457 --> 00:09:25.865
Now I couldn't tell you exactly
what that something was,

00:09:25.965 --> 00:09:28.703
but I'm willing to bet you
could tell me, couldn't you,

00:09:28.803 --> 00:09:32.612
Miss Annerose Nichtsehen of
Velgalta's Seven Blades?

00:09:32.712 --> 00:09:35.150
I no longer go by that name.

00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:36.854
Now it's just Annerose.

00:09:36.954 --> 00:09:38.590
[Quinton]
Didn't mean to offend.

00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:42.699
Belated congratulations on
passing the Goddess' Trial,
by the way.

00:09:42.799 --> 00:09:43.934
[Annerose] Thanks.

00:09:44.034 --> 00:09:46.104
[Quinton]
So I'm assuming you managed

00:09:46.205 --> 00:09:48.143
to figure out
what the hell he did,

00:09:48.243 --> 00:09:49.545
'cause I'm at a loss.

00:09:49.646 --> 00:09:51.917
I couldn't see
precisely what he did.

00:09:52.017 --> 00:09:54.088
I never expected him
to be so fast

00:09:54.188 --> 00:09:56.726
that I couldn't follow
his every move.

00:09:56.827 --> 00:09:59.365
But the one thing
I know for sure is

00:09:59.465 --> 00:10:01.870
Mundane's right hand moved.

00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:04.007
[Quinton]
Huh? His right hand, eh?

00:10:04.107 --> 00:10:06.312
[Annerose] Yes, his right hand.

00:10:06.412 --> 00:10:07.983
I couldn't make out
what it did,

00:10:08.083 --> 00:10:10.253
but I'm certain of the fact
that it moved.

00:10:10.353 --> 00:10:12.758
And if there's anything else
I could say for sure,

00:10:12.858 --> 00:10:15.163
it's that it was
unbelievably fast.

00:10:15.263 --> 00:10:19.104
[Quinton] Huh? So you're saying
my guess was wrong?

00:10:19.204 --> 00:10:21.510
Here I thought he was
breaking the rules

00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:23.980
by using a damned artifact.

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:26.620
[Annerose] I wouldn't rule out
the possibility.

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:29.759
Either way, his match today
should tell us more.

00:10:29.859 --> 00:10:33.600
His opponent will be Goldy
Gilded, the Unbeaten Legend.

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:36.305
He has NEVER lost
a single fight.

00:10:36.405 --> 00:10:37.641
Oh, really?

00:10:37.741 --> 00:10:40.313
I've never heard of him,
but he sounds famous.

00:10:40.413 --> 00:10:42.117
Is he tough?

00:10:42.217 --> 00:10:44.789
He's famous, all right,
for what that's worth.

00:10:44.889 --> 00:10:46.727
I've been matched
with him three times

00:10:46.827 --> 00:10:48.530
in past tournaments myself.

00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:51.836
[Quinton] But Goldy has
never lost a fight.
(armor gleams)

00:10:51.936 --> 00:10:54.107
Does that mean he beat you too?

00:10:54.208 --> 00:10:57.515
[Annerose] Don't be ridiculous.
I never got to fight him.

00:10:57.615 --> 00:10:59.384
Huh? What the hell's that mean?

00:10:59.484 --> 00:11:01.088
He never fights against anyone

00:11:01.188 --> 00:11:04.228
who has the possibility
of beating him.

00:11:04.328 --> 00:11:06.331
If he's matched with one,
he forfeits.

00:11:06.431 --> 00:11:09.673
That's how he earned the
nickname "Unbeaten Legend."

00:11:09.773 --> 00:11:11.175
But of course,
he hates that name

00:11:11.275 --> 00:11:14.582
and calls himself
"Ever-Victorious Golden Dragon."

00:11:14.682 --> 00:11:17.286
(chuckles)
"Victorious" and "Unbeaten"...

00:11:17.387 --> 00:11:20.761
They sound the same, but mean
completely different things.

00:11:20.861 --> 00:11:22.164
[Annerose] Do they really?

00:11:22.264 --> 00:11:25.003
He fights only the opponents
he knows he can beat

00:11:25.103 --> 00:11:27.407
and worms his way up
through the ranks.

00:11:27.508 --> 00:11:29.144
In small-scale competitions,

00:11:29.244 --> 00:11:31.248
he's even made his
way to champion.

00:11:31.348 --> 00:11:34.154
[Quinton] Wow,
so he's not a total weakling.

00:11:34.254 --> 00:11:36.660
[Annerose] Goldy's greatest
asset is that he can see

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:39.097
exactly how good
his opponent is,

00:11:39.197 --> 00:11:43.205
and yet he chose not to run
away from Mundane.

00:11:43.306 --> 00:11:44.909
[Quinton]
I see what you're saying.

00:11:45.009 --> 00:11:46.746
So either the Unbeaten Legend

00:11:46.847 --> 00:11:49.017
couldn't see Mundane's
true strength,

00:11:49.117 --> 00:11:50.954
or Mundane is a rotten coward

00:11:51.055 --> 00:11:53.459
who lets an artifact
do all the work.

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:54.829
[Annerose] Not only that,

00:11:54.929 --> 00:11:57.167
but the Unbeaten Legend has
only ever faced off

00:11:57.267 --> 00:11:59.204
against fighters
he knew he could beat.

00:11:59.304 --> 00:12:01.643
In other words,
he has never shown any of us

00:12:01.743 --> 00:12:03.046
how powerful he really is.

00:12:03.146 --> 00:12:05.918
[Quinton]
That does sound interesting.

00:12:06.018 --> 00:12:06.920
Yes.

00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:08.957
[ref] Round Four, Match Six.

00:12:09.057 --> 00:12:12.197
Goldy Gilded versus
Mundane Mann!

00:12:12.297 --> 00:12:14.434
Ready! Fight!

00:12:14.535 --> 00:12:16.438
(Goldy yells)
(exciting music)

00:12:16.539 --> 00:12:18.042
Huh?

00:12:20.514 --> 00:12:22.016
(bone cracks)

00:12:23.419 --> 00:12:24.589
(swish)

00:12:24.689 --> 00:12:26.125
(Goldy yells)

00:12:26.225 --> 00:12:27.528
Huh?

00:12:29.532 --> 00:12:31.034
[Goldy] Wha?

00:12:32.705 --> 00:12:35.209
(waaah)

00:12:35.309 --> 00:12:36.813
Huh?

00:12:45.731 --> 00:12:47.400
(stammering)

00:12:49.739 --> 00:12:51.910
So you think you can
mess with me?

00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:53.814
[Quinton] Did you see it?
[Annerose] Just barely.

00:12:53.914 --> 00:12:57.120
Impressive indeed.
I wasn't able to see anything.

00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:59.324
I was sure the
Unbeaten Legend's sword

00:12:59.424 --> 00:13:01.562
was about to take off
Mundane's head.

00:13:01.662 --> 00:13:04.401
[Annerose] You're right.
No normal person could have

00:13:04.502 --> 00:13:05.838
gotten out of the way in time.

00:13:05.938 --> 00:13:07.875
But just before the
sword got to him,

00:13:07.975 --> 00:13:09.946
Mundane cracked his neck.

00:13:10.046 --> 00:13:11.148
He cracked his neck?

00:13:11.248 --> 00:13:13.887
Like this,
crack, crackle, crack.

00:13:13.987 --> 00:13:15.189
Wait just a damn minute!

00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:17.227
What the hell are
you talking about?

00:13:17.327 --> 00:13:19.131
[Annerose]
I don't understand it either,

00:13:19.231 --> 00:13:22.170
but as soon as he tilted his
head, I heard a crack,

00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:24.174
and he had dodged
Goldy's sword.

00:13:24.274 --> 00:13:26.012
[Quinton]
Come on, there's no way.

00:13:26.112 --> 00:13:27.982
You're saying he wanted
to crack his neck

00:13:28.082 --> 00:13:30.153
and happened to do it
at just the right time?

00:13:30.253 --> 00:13:32.424
That kind of coincidence
doesn't happen.

00:13:32.525 --> 00:13:34.361
And if it's not a coincidence?

00:13:34.461 --> 00:13:35.329
That's crazy.

00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:37.535
This man cracked his neck
so quickly

00:13:37.635 --> 00:13:38.971
that even I would
have missed it

00:13:39.071 --> 00:13:40.507
if I hadn't been
watching for it.

00:13:40.607 --> 00:13:43.412
Do you think a normal human
being could do such a thing?

00:13:43.513 --> 00:13:46.151
(uh) That is a good point.
Hold on a sec!

00:13:46.251 --> 00:13:47.988
That sword was coming
really fast.

00:13:48.089 --> 00:13:49.491
There's no way anybody
could dodge it

00:13:49.592 --> 00:13:51.763
by cracking their neck
at just the right time.

00:13:51.863 --> 00:13:53.600
[Annerose]
I only half-believe it myself.

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:55.169
Maybe it was
just a coincidence.

00:13:55.269 --> 00:13:58.510
But then again, what if it
wasn't at all, Quinton?

00:14:00.146 --> 00:14:02.083
I really don't like you.

00:14:02.184 --> 00:14:04.789
You just let a one in a million
chance get away from you,

00:14:04.889 --> 00:14:07.493
so how can you stand there
like you don't care?

00:14:07.594 --> 00:14:10.367
You'll have one opportunity in
your entire life

00:14:10.467 --> 00:14:13.405
to potentially beat me,
and you just LOST yours!

00:14:13.506 --> 00:14:14.943
Show some disappointment!

00:14:15.043 --> 00:14:16.212
Get on the ground and writhe

00:14:16.312 --> 00:14:18.149
like the miserable
worm you are!

00:14:18.249 --> 00:14:21.188
Anything else would be
blasphemy against me!

00:14:22.691 --> 00:14:23.927
(Goldy growls)

00:14:24.027 --> 00:14:25.362
What in the hell?

00:14:25.462 --> 00:14:27.735
Don't you know you gave up your
golden opportunity?

00:14:27.835 --> 00:14:33.011
A puny weakling of Power Level
17 thinks he can humiliate ME?

00:14:33.112 --> 00:14:35.584
I will bury you!

00:14:35.685 --> 00:14:38.021
Behold my power!

00:14:39.725 --> 00:14:41.830
(dramatic music building)

00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:45.637
[Goldy]
Here's something you can think
about in the afterlife!

00:14:45.737 --> 00:14:49.879
My power level is 4,330,
you punk!

00:14:49.979 --> 00:14:52.985
Demon God, Fatal Strike!

00:14:53.085 --> 00:14:55.457
Golden Dragon Blade!

00:14:55.558 --> 00:14:56.693
(music stops abruptly)

00:14:56.793 --> 00:14:58.295
(gasps)

00:14:59.097 --> 00:15:01.201
(whirring whistle)

00:15:01.301 --> 00:15:03.105
(waaah)

00:15:11.288 --> 00:15:13.358
(Mundane sighs)
(Goldy groans)

00:15:15.162 --> 00:15:16.699
[ref] The... The winner...

00:15:16.799 --> 00:15:18.035
Mundane Mann?

00:15:18.135 --> 00:15:19.471
(Goldy groans)

00:15:19.572 --> 00:15:21.776
That's just frickin' crazy.
(crowd murmurs)

00:15:21.876 --> 00:15:23.279
Goldy's no pushover.

00:15:23.379 --> 00:15:26.151
He's better than I thought
if he's able to manifest that:

00:15:26.251 --> 00:15:28.189
a visual of magical power.

00:15:28.289 --> 00:15:29.659
If he had aimed higher

00:15:29.759 --> 00:15:32.063
and sought out battles with
stronger opponents,

00:15:32.163 --> 00:15:35.102
he could have become an
outstanding Dark Knight.

00:15:35.202 --> 00:15:38.943
[Quinton] So, what did Mundane
do at the end there?

00:15:39.946 --> 00:15:42.016
If I saw what I think I saw,

00:15:42.117 --> 00:15:44.087
Mundane sneezed.

00:15:44.823 --> 00:15:45.725
Huh?!

00:15:45.825 --> 00:15:47.426
(soft dramatic music)

00:15:47.528 --> 00:15:50.534
[Annerose] Maybe the golden
dragon was too bright for him.

00:15:51.102 --> 00:15:52.303
Mundane sneezed,

00:15:52.403 --> 00:15:54.809
and at the same time,
his sword swung down.

00:15:54.909 --> 00:15:56.913
Goldy charged right into it.

00:15:57.013 --> 00:15:59.317
It was an accidental crash.

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:02.123
No way, that's insane!

00:16:02.223 --> 00:16:05.396
The dragon clashed with a
sneeze and the sneeze won?!

00:16:05.496 --> 00:16:06.999
[Annerose]
That is what happened.

00:16:07.099 --> 00:16:10.039
Goldy said Mundane lost a
golden opportunity.

00:16:10.139 --> 00:16:12.410
But Mundane never had
any need to wait

00:16:12.511 --> 00:16:14.616
for Goldy to
give him an opening.

00:16:14.716 --> 00:16:16.018
It's almost like to Mundane,

00:16:16.118 --> 00:16:18.557
every fraction of a second
was an opening.

00:16:18.657 --> 00:16:20.392
Ha! That's ridiculous.

00:16:20.492 --> 00:16:22.665
I was wasting my time with you.

00:16:22.765 --> 00:16:24.234
If that punk keeps winning,

00:16:24.334 --> 00:16:27.073
then he'll be up against me
in the preliminary finals.

00:16:27.173 --> 00:16:30.280
I'll show everyone what
he's REALLY made of.

00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:33.854
[Annerose] <i>Would I be able to
move the way he does?</i>

00:16:33.954 --> 00:16:36.324
(neck cracks)
(Annerose sneezes)

00:16:42.504 --> 00:16:44.007
Oh!

00:16:48.182 --> 00:16:50.052
(embarrassed)

00:16:56.365 --> 00:16:58.302
[Iris] And that is the
security plan for the main

00:16:58.402 --> 00:17:01.676
Bushin Festival tournament
next week, Lord Asshat.

00:17:01.776 --> 00:17:05.951
Please, Princess Iris, I insist
that you call me Perv.

00:17:06.051 --> 00:17:08.990
Very well, then I shall call
you Lord Perv.

00:17:09.091 --> 00:17:10.727
I know I have asked you
this before,

00:17:10.827 --> 00:17:12.330
but are you absolutely certain

00:17:12.430 --> 00:17:14.702
you feel no need for
increased security?

00:17:14.802 --> 00:17:17.140
[Perv] Of course not.
It's not as if anything happened

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:20.112
that would create an
unusual stir.

00:17:20.212 --> 00:17:22.183
[Iris] Your condition appears
to be much different

00:17:22.284 --> 00:17:24.655
than what I was told
in the reports.

00:17:24.755 --> 00:17:28.195
[Perv] Yes, the story seems to
have been somewhat exaggerated.

00:17:28.295 --> 00:17:31.635
You Midgardians are all
so prone to worrying.

00:17:31.736 --> 00:17:35.309
Perhaps we can blame that on
Princess Alexia's kidnapping.

00:17:35.409 --> 00:17:37.715
[Iris] (low growl)
(Perv chuckles)

00:17:37.815 --> 00:17:39.284
I understand you personally

00:17:39.384 --> 00:17:43.126
went to the rescue of your
dear, delicate younger sister.

00:17:43.226 --> 00:17:46.198
Our kingdom intends to
follow your example.

00:17:46.298 --> 00:17:49.237
We will solve family problems
within the family.

00:17:49.337 --> 00:17:53.478
[Oriana] We will do just as
Perv Asshat commands of us.

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:56.686
[Perv] You see?
His Majesty concurs.

00:17:56.786 --> 00:17:59.692
Please leave the rest to me,
Your Highness.

00:17:59.792 --> 00:18:03.032
Court negotiations,
reconstruction of the
knightly order,

00:18:03.132 --> 00:18:05.369
and our part in the
Bushin Festival...

00:18:05.469 --> 00:18:08.142
I can understand your anxiety,
Your Highness,

00:18:08.242 --> 00:18:11.516
but please,
put your mind at ease.
(Iris growls)

00:18:11.616 --> 00:18:13.385
Our kingdom will do
nothing to disquiet

00:18:13.485 --> 00:18:16.592
your pretty little head,
Princess Iris.

00:18:16.692 --> 00:18:18.362
Right, Your Majesty?

00:18:18.462 --> 00:18:22.538
We will do just as
Perv Asshat commands of us.

00:18:22.638 --> 00:18:24.474
(growls)

00:18:26.078 --> 00:18:28.415
(explosion)

00:18:33.125 --> 00:18:35.864
[ref]
Th-the winner, Mundane Mann!

00:18:35.964 --> 00:18:37.233
(sneezes)

00:18:37.333 --> 00:18:39.203
What in the heck
is going on here?

00:18:39.303 --> 00:18:42.711
Yesterday, he beat the
Ever-Victorious Legend Goldy,

00:18:42.811 --> 00:18:44.414
and now he's won again?

00:18:44.515 --> 00:18:46.919
Looks like he's going to
the main tournament.

00:18:47.019 --> 00:18:49.157
[brown jacket] There's nothing
spectacular about Quinton,

00:18:49.257 --> 00:18:51.395
but he's consistent and the
odds were in his favor.

00:18:51.495 --> 00:18:53.165
To think he'd come up
against this guy

00:18:53.265 --> 00:18:54.735
and not even get
to make a move.

00:18:54.836 --> 00:18:57.440
[tan shirt] If he's made it
this far, it can't be a fluke.

00:18:57.542 --> 00:19:00.814
But I can't for the life of me
figure out how he's winning.

00:19:00.914 --> 00:19:03.352
I don't know if it's safe
to bet on him or not.

00:19:03.452 --> 00:19:05.490
[brown jacket] For Dark Horse
betting, this is interesting.

00:19:05.591 --> 00:19:08.830
If everything goes normally,
Iris is gonna win again
this year.

00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:10.466
If anyone's gonna change that,

00:19:10.567 --> 00:19:12.504
it's gonna be a
mysterious Dark Knight.

00:19:12.604 --> 00:19:14.140
[tan shirt] Like Mundane Mann.

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:16.078
But for Round One in
the main tournament,

00:19:16.178 --> 00:19:18.215
he's up against the Annerose.

00:19:18.315 --> 00:19:21.288
I'd say his odds are most
likely nine to one.

00:19:21.388 --> 00:19:24.360
Come on, man, there is no way
that could be true.

00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:27.466
My dearest friend and brother
from another mother, Po Tato...

00:19:27.567 --> 00:19:30.540
How are you? Will you please
send me some money for an
investment?

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:33.613
As for me, I am currently
working on improving myself
for the future.

00:19:33.713 --> 00:19:37.755
So I beg of you, please send
over some funds now,
please dear friend.

00:19:37.855 --> 00:19:39.625
(laughing) Not a chance!

00:19:39.725 --> 00:19:41.227
(laughs)

00:19:44.234 --> 00:19:45.269
(waaah)

00:19:45.369 --> 00:19:46.338
[Kagenou]
<i>The guy I fought today</i>

00:19:46.438 --> 00:19:48.141
<i>was awfully enthusiastic.</i>

00:19:48.241 --> 00:19:49.812
<i>I think his name was...</i>

00:19:49.912 --> 00:19:52.784
Quin, uh, something like that.

00:19:52.884 --> 00:19:55.690
He reminds me of
someone I met, I think.

00:19:55.790 --> 00:19:56.959
Yeah, but who?

00:19:57.059 --> 00:19:58.563
Hmm?

00:20:00.365 --> 00:20:01.602
[Mundane] Can I help you?

00:20:01.702 --> 00:20:03.104
I never would have guessed you

00:20:03.205 --> 00:20:04.842
would make it to
the main tournament.

00:20:04.942 --> 00:20:06.278
I'm impressed.

00:20:06.378 --> 00:20:08.215
[Mundane]
It was the natural outcome.

00:20:08.315 --> 00:20:10.352
I admit, I misjudged you.

00:20:10.453 --> 00:20:12.625
I didn't realize
your true strength.

00:20:12.725 --> 00:20:13.860
You did very well.

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:16.899
But I would like to give you
a warning, if I could.

00:20:16.999 --> 00:20:18.469
A warning?

00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:20.941
I've seen your every move,
Mundane.

00:20:21.041 --> 00:20:22.410
You'd best not assume
you can win

00:20:22.511 --> 00:20:24.681
in the same ways you have been.

00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:27.353
(chuckles)

00:20:29.257 --> 00:20:31.261
What the hell's so funny,
Mundane?

00:20:31.361 --> 00:20:32.999
[Kagenou] <i>Yes, here it is!</i>

00:20:33.099 --> 00:20:35.370
(soft dramatic music)

00:20:35.470 --> 00:20:38.341
[Mundane]
Allow me to give YOU a warning.

00:20:41.816 --> 00:20:43.452
(large thud)

00:20:43.553 --> 00:20:44.822
[Annerose] Wh-what?

00:20:44.922 --> 00:20:46.324
These weights I wear

00:20:46.425 --> 00:20:49.231
are chains that are
holding me back.

00:20:49.331 --> 00:20:51.502
Play time is over.

00:20:53.271 --> 00:20:55.342
(Annerose gasps)
(large thuds)

00:20:56.679 --> 00:20:58.382
Hey!

00:20:58.482 --> 00:21:00.186
Hold on, don't go!

00:21:00.286 --> 00:21:01.488
I said stop!

00:21:01.589 --> 00:21:04.060
Don't start thinking
this means you've won.

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:05.263
I'll show you!

00:21:05.363 --> 00:21:06.632
You're not the only one
who can do it!

00:21:06.732 --> 00:21:09.605
I can do it too.
(neck cracks)

00:21:16.552 --> 00:21:17.854
Kay.

00:21:21.996 --> 00:21:26.004
[Kagenou] <i>What exactly was she
trying to do?</i>
(neck cracks)

00:21:27.273 --> 00:21:29.611
(wind whistling softly)

00:21:37.293 --> 00:21:39.631
(swords clashing)

00:21:45.142 --> 00:21:46.245
(gasps)

00:21:46.345 --> 00:21:48.683
(dark music)

00:21:49.986 --> 00:21:51.856
(waaah)
(blood splatters)

00:21:53.392 --> 00:21:55.730
(knight groaning)

00:21:56.732 --> 00:21:58.770
I made sure not to
hit your vitals,

00:21:58.870 --> 00:22:01.642
but you should hurry back
and get that looked at.

00:22:02.644 --> 00:22:04.180
[knights]
Hey, are you all right?

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:06.217
-She went that way! Hurry!

00:22:06.317 --> 00:22:08.355
-You won't get away!

00:22:09.423 --> 00:22:12.363
You are gonna pay
for what you've done!

00:22:21.181 --> 00:22:23.519
