00:00:01.302 --> 00:00:03.641
(laidback guitar music)

00:00:08.417 --> 00:00:10.220
[Kagenou]
<i>The school was half destroyed,</i>

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.525
<i>so we started
summer break early.</i>

00:00:13.628 --> 00:00:15.732
<i>Most of the students
have gone back home,</i>

00:00:15.832 --> 00:00:17.702
<i>and it's quiet in the dorms.</i>

00:00:18.671 --> 00:00:20.709
<i>I don't have anything
to do at home,</i>

00:00:20.809 --> 00:00:23.146
<i>so I decided to stay here.</i>

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.524
<i>But it turns out there's
nothing to do here either.</i>

00:00:33.267 --> 00:00:35.037
(yawns)
(wings fluttering)

00:00:35.137 --> 00:00:37.241
<i>Then I got a letter from Alpha.</i>

00:00:40.882 --> 00:00:43.086
Hmm...

00:00:43.186 --> 00:00:46.594
So the time has come
to settle old accounts.

00:00:46.694 --> 00:00:49.231
Yes, of course,
it's the final resting place

00:00:49.331 --> 00:00:52.371
of ancient memories
and demonic grudges:

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.116
the Sacred Land, Lindwurm.

00:00:59.854 --> 00:01:02.190
(OPENING THEME)

00:02:36.948 --> 00:02:39.284
(quiet chatter)

00:02:40.187 --> 00:02:41.455
(yawns)

00:02:41.556 --> 00:02:43.927
(birds chirping outside)
(light snoring)

00:02:46.466 --> 00:02:48.269
(sleepily) Um, Boss...

00:02:49.005 --> 00:02:51.342
(metal scraping)

00:02:59.693 --> 00:03:01.863
(thud)
(clatter)

00:03:07.742 --> 00:03:09.411
(giggles)

00:03:09.512 --> 00:03:13.854
Another day,
another beautiful me!

00:03:15.056 --> 00:03:17.394
(magical twinkling)

00:03:21.704 --> 00:03:23.774
Perfection!

00:03:23.874 --> 00:03:25.110
When I met Lord Shadow,

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:27.882
I gained the power to fight
against two fates.

00:03:28.884 --> 00:03:31.222
(violin music)

00:03:32.424 --> 00:03:33.628
[Epsilon] What is that?

00:03:33.728 --> 00:03:36.332
[Cid] This is the power
to change your fate.

00:03:37.234 --> 00:03:39.371
When you can change
your form at will,

00:03:39.471 --> 00:03:42.144
you can change a fate
doomed to defeat.

00:03:42.244 --> 00:03:44.281
You can be victorious.

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:46.353
[Epsilon] Fate...

00:03:46.453 --> 00:03:49.091
Change your fate and
take hold of the truth

00:03:49.191 --> 00:03:51.830
that lurks in the shadows
of this world.

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.333
Take hold.

00:03:53.433 --> 00:03:55.237
[Epsilon] Take hold...

00:03:55.337 --> 00:03:56.840
of the truth!

00:03:58.343 --> 00:04:00.982
My Lord, I swear to you,

00:04:01.082 --> 00:04:04.756
I will claim victory
over nature.

00:04:05.558 --> 00:04:08.597
(footsteps echoing)

00:04:08.697 --> 00:04:10.502
Crimson eyes that
sparkle brighter

00:04:10.602 --> 00:04:12.037
than the moon in the heavens,
(classical guitar music)

00:04:12.137 --> 00:04:14.876
supple locks whose luster put
the finest silk to shame,

00:04:14.977 --> 00:04:18.382
the words he speaks cause even
the demons to cower in fear,

00:04:18.483 --> 00:04:21.657
a man in the purest black that
is virile, yet beautiful...

00:04:21.757 --> 00:04:25.297
[Zenon] I see. So you with your
muscles finely sculpted

00:04:25.397 --> 00:04:27.401
and your visage
a sublime perfection,

00:04:27.502 --> 00:04:29.005
you're the stray dog
that's been

00:04:29.105 --> 00:04:30.474
snapping at the cult
as of late.

00:04:30.575 --> 00:04:33.347
(aside) You would call Lord
Shadow a "stray dog"?!

00:04:33.447 --> 00:04:35.350
(soaring string music)

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:36.753
My name is Shadow,

00:04:36.853 --> 00:04:39.492
he who lurks in the shadows
and hunts the shadows.

00:04:39.593 --> 00:04:42.264
I will be the one to lead that
beautiful young elf

00:04:42.364 --> 00:04:43.935
to her salvation.

00:04:44.035 --> 00:04:45.538
Lord Shadow!

00:04:46.138 --> 00:04:47.474
My apologies.

00:04:47.575 --> 00:04:50.114
I shouldn't have kept you
waiting, my charming elf.

00:04:50.214 --> 00:04:52.618
Now that I'm here, I will...

00:04:52.718 --> 00:04:54.021
I will...

00:04:54.923 --> 00:04:56.192
[Beta] No good!

00:04:56.292 --> 00:04:59.198
It seems just a little too
overly dramatic.

00:04:59.298 --> 00:05:00.568
(sighs in frustration)

00:05:00.668 --> 00:05:02.639
(birds chirping outside)

00:05:02.739 --> 00:05:05.344
That's no excuse to use
such a shoddy character

00:05:05.444 --> 00:05:07.715
as a female lead!

00:05:12.457 --> 00:05:15.363
Maybe I should go outside and
get some fresh air?

00:05:21.108 --> 00:05:23.446
Where did I leave my clothes?

00:05:30.294 --> 00:05:33.400
(birds chirping)

00:05:33.501 --> 00:05:35.404
[Epsilon] Good morning, Beta.
(boing)

00:05:35.505 --> 00:05:37.742
[Beta] Good morning, Epsilon.
(boing)

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:42.417
[Epsilon] (giggles)
[Beta] (soft growl)

00:05:42.518 --> 00:05:44.790
-Is it my imagination?
-Huh?

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:46.726
-I feel as if our Lord Shadow
(boing, boing)

00:05:46.826 --> 00:05:49.098
-has been looking my way more
frequently as of late.
(boing, boing)

00:05:49.198 --> 00:05:52.171
Many times I have felt the
intense passion of his gaze
(bright campy music)

00:05:52.271 --> 00:05:54.543
right here at my supple bosom,
you see.

00:05:54.643 --> 00:05:56.980
(gasps) That can't be right!

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.617
It must be some mistake.

00:05:58.717 --> 00:06:00.420
[Epsilon] Oh, it's no mistake.

00:06:00.521 --> 00:06:03.727
Please, surely you've noticed
it yourself, Beta.

00:06:03.828 --> 00:06:05.765
[Epsilong] After all,
you and I are definitely
[girl] Oh?

00:06:05.865 --> 00:06:07.769
-much more aware of
those sorts of glances.
-Ah!

00:06:07.869 --> 00:06:09.706
[Beta] That's true...
(cat meows)

00:06:09.806 --> 00:06:12.077
[Beta] But is it right for me,
[girl] Hi! (cat meows)

00:06:12.178 --> 00:06:16.954
-little old me, to charm our
imminent master like that?
-(giggles) (gasps)

00:06:17.054 --> 00:06:19.593
[Epsilon] I mean, you felt the
Lord's impassioned gaze

00:06:19.693 --> 00:06:21.563
yourself, haven't you?

00:06:21.664 --> 00:06:25.538
After all, YOUR boobs are far
larger than MY meager bust.

00:06:25.638 --> 00:06:27.808
[Beta] What?! I mean, no, I-

00:06:27.908 --> 00:06:31.048
[Epsilon] What's this?!
Have you not felt his gaze?!

00:06:32.151 --> 00:06:33.253
[girl] See?

00:06:33.353 --> 00:06:35.190
[Nu] What are you two doing,
may I ask?

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:37.595
[Epsilon] Huh? Oh!
(cat meowing)

00:06:37.695 --> 00:06:39.465
Oh, hey!
Good morning, there, Nu.

00:06:39.566 --> 00:06:41.703
Is there something the matter?

00:06:41.803 --> 00:06:42.939
(sighs)

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:46.412
We have received a directive
from Lady Alpha.

00:06:51.055 --> 00:06:53.126
[Iris] This is a very
successful business, I see.

00:06:53.226 --> 00:06:55.798
[Alexia]
Everyone in the capital is
talking about this place.

00:06:55.898 --> 00:06:58.537
They have everything,
and it's all the best quality.

00:06:58.638 --> 00:07:00.642
(quiet chatter)

00:07:00.742 --> 00:07:02.578
Well, I really only
came to help you shop

00:07:02.678 --> 00:07:05.584
for your upcoming trip,
but I see.

00:07:05.684 --> 00:07:07.589
It's a fascinating place.

00:07:07.689 --> 00:07:09.759
[Alexia] Isn't it? And you
really should be aware

00:07:09.859 --> 00:07:11.863
of the trends in
the Royal Capitol.

00:07:11.963 --> 00:07:13.466
[Iris] You can follow the
trends if you want,

00:07:13.567 --> 00:07:15.872
but don't forget
why you're here.

00:07:15.972 --> 00:07:17.976
You are heading off
to the Sacred Land

00:07:18.076 --> 00:07:21.115
as a special guest
for the Goddess' Trial.

00:07:21.216 --> 00:07:22.852
I know, I know!

00:07:22.952 --> 00:07:24.823
But it's normal for
the special guest

00:07:24.923 --> 00:07:27.127
to mingle with the archbishop,
remember?

00:07:27.227 --> 00:07:30.133
I can use that time
as an opportunity to look into

00:07:30.233 --> 00:07:33.139
the dark rumors about corruption
and missing orphans.

00:07:33.239 --> 00:07:35.344
And since I'm just
a helpless little princess,

00:07:35.444 --> 00:07:36.814
no one will suspect a thing.

00:07:36.914 --> 00:07:38.584
It's true that people
are less guarded

00:07:38.684 --> 00:07:40.554
around you than around me.

00:07:40.654 --> 00:07:42.826
Now I'm starting to think that
maybe I shouldn't have

00:07:42.926 --> 00:07:45.096
told you about the
investigation.

00:07:46.498 --> 00:07:47.968
Pardon me, your Highness.

00:07:48.068 --> 00:07:51.142
I'm terribly sorry I didn't
pay my respects sooner.

00:07:51.242 --> 00:07:54.549
I am the president of this
humble establishment, you see?

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:56.151
My name is Luna.

00:07:57.087 --> 00:07:59.224
(cheery orchestra music)

00:08:01.261 --> 00:08:05.170
Delicious, the citrus one
is really good, too.

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:07.207
It's an unusual flavor.

00:08:07.307 --> 00:08:08.409
I will take both of them.

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:10.180
Send them to my dorm, please.

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:11.784
Thank you for your patronage.

00:08:11.884 --> 00:08:13.352
It's very much appreciated.

00:08:13.452 --> 00:08:14.823
If you have any more
new products,

00:08:14.923 --> 00:08:16.392
will you choose some for me?

00:08:16.492 --> 00:08:18.029
Absolutely, I will,
your Highness.

00:08:18.129 --> 00:08:22.070
Alexia, the reason we came here
was to prepare for your trip.

00:08:22.171 --> 00:08:23.740
I know, I know.

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:25.578
Oh, you will be traveling?

00:08:25.678 --> 00:08:27.448
[Alexia] To the Sacred Land.

00:08:27.549 --> 00:08:29.217
[Gamma] My, my, my...

00:08:29.317 --> 00:08:32.391
Then allow me to select some
items that you may need.

00:08:32.491 --> 00:08:34.529
Oh, thank you.

00:08:35.931 --> 00:08:37.400
I won't be needing it
for my trip,

00:08:37.502 --> 00:08:40.407
but I wonder if you could show
me some articles of clothing

00:08:40.508 --> 00:08:41.843
that perhaps you
would recommend?

00:08:41.944 --> 00:08:43.279
If you're looking for
party dresses,

00:08:43.379 --> 00:08:45.785
we already ordered you several
that should suffice.

00:08:45.885 --> 00:08:47.655
Oh no, it's nothing like that.

00:08:47.756 --> 00:08:50.393
I want something that's more
for every day wear, you know?

00:08:50.493 --> 00:08:51.997
Something that's more casual.

00:08:52.097 --> 00:08:54.770
Are you meaning as
a gift for a friend?

00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:58.242
[Alexia]
Um, not exactly a gift,

00:08:58.342 --> 00:09:01.181
but it's not exactly
for me either.

00:09:01.281 --> 00:09:02.652
(chuckles)

00:09:02.752 --> 00:09:05.123
[Gamma] Then may I suggest
something along these lines?

00:09:05.223 --> 00:09:06.426
[both] Hmm?

00:09:06.527 --> 00:09:08.630
(Luna claps)

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:11.068
(magical twinkling)

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:16.078
[Iris] Th-th-those?!

00:09:16.178 --> 00:09:16.980
Wait, but those are-

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:18.717
Those are women's
undergarments.

00:09:18.817 --> 00:09:20.588
They are called
thong underwear.

00:09:20.688 --> 00:09:23.794
Th-thong underwear?

00:09:23.894 --> 00:09:26.900
[Iris] Um, I feel that there is
not enough fabric coverage,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.004
and I can also see
through some of it.

00:09:29.105 --> 00:09:30.708
It is my understanding
that these are

00:09:30.808 --> 00:09:32.477
very pleasing to the men-folk.

00:09:32.579 --> 00:09:33.747
[Iris] Men-folk?

00:09:33.847 --> 00:09:36.619
Alexia, don't tell me that you-

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:38.089
Iris...

00:09:38.189 --> 00:09:39.091
(gasps)

00:09:39.191 --> 00:09:40.293
[Alexia] I...

00:09:40.393 --> 00:09:43.299
I am confident that I have
finely-shaped buttocks.

00:09:43.399 --> 00:09:44.670
[Iris] That is not the issue!

00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:47.542
Unhand those panties!

00:09:47.642 --> 00:09:49.846
(hmphf) Look, Iris,
I am confident

00:09:49.946 --> 00:09:51.550
that I have a finely-shaped-

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:52.952
You have already said that!

00:09:53.052 --> 00:09:55.089
Your Highness, you may try
them on if you like.

00:09:55.189 --> 00:09:56.693
[Iris] Huh?!
[Alexia] I'd love to.

00:09:56.793 --> 00:09:58.597
Oh, you will not!

00:09:58.697 --> 00:10:00.701
You're plotting to put them on
then take advantage

00:10:00.801 --> 00:10:02.806
of my confusion to buy them.

00:10:02.906 --> 00:10:04.208
[Gamma] Princess Iris,

00:10:04.308 --> 00:10:06.378
I believe you've been given
the wrong impression.

00:10:06.478 --> 00:10:09.118
A thong is an undergarment that
was made for women.

00:10:09.218 --> 00:10:11.556
[Iris] That's not what
you said a minute ago.

00:10:11.656 --> 00:10:14.194
[Gamma] I happen to be
wearing one right now.

00:10:14.294 --> 00:10:17.400
See? Even under a dress
of such thin fabric,

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:19.271
there's no panty line visible.

00:10:19.371 --> 00:10:22.845
[Alexia] Amazing!
Iris, you HAVE to see this.
[Iris] No, thank you.

00:10:22.945 --> 00:10:24.281
[Alexia] I'll just step into
the dressing room.

00:10:24.381 --> 00:10:27.020
[Iris] Alexia?!
Hold it right there, Alexia.

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:29.392
Now see here, you need to
take off your shoes

00:10:29.492 --> 00:10:30.594
and fold your clothes.

00:10:30.694 --> 00:10:31.997
[Alexia] So nice to the touch.

00:10:32.097 --> 00:10:33.466
Now how does it feel to wear?

00:10:33.567 --> 00:10:36.139
[Iris] Alexia, how can you...

00:10:36.239 --> 00:10:38.109
Those garments are
completely see through!

00:10:38.209 --> 00:10:39.746
[Alexia]
They cover just barely enough.

00:10:39.846 --> 00:10:41.382
[Iris] That is not enough.

00:10:41.482 --> 00:10:42.885
It's clearly revealing your...

00:10:42.985 --> 00:10:46.058
Anyway, no, you can't have
them. I won't allow it!

00:10:46.158 --> 00:10:47.629
[Alexia]
And you won't change your mind?

00:10:47.729 --> 00:10:50.300
[Iris]
I will NOT change my mind.

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:51.670
[Alexia] I see...

00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:53.673
But Iris...

00:10:54.676 --> 00:10:57.013
Alexia, what are you...

00:10:57.113 --> 00:11:00.187
Look, Iris, I refuse to be
bombarded with words

00:11:00.287 --> 00:11:02.057
I don't need to hear.

00:11:02.157 --> 00:11:03.860
I want to value
the words of those

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:07.502
who will acknowledge me
despite my worthless existence.

00:11:07.602 --> 00:11:09.839
But that's... Please, you...

00:11:09.939 --> 00:11:12.344
If you refuse to allow me
this thong, Iris,

00:11:12.444 --> 00:11:13.947
then I, of course, will yield.

00:11:14.047 --> 00:11:16.953
I very much want to wear
a thong to win him.

00:11:17.053 --> 00:11:18.122
I mean,

00:11:18.222 --> 00:11:20.427
I have a strong personal desire
to wear a thong,

00:11:20.528 --> 00:11:21.696
but I WILL yield.

00:11:21.796 --> 00:11:23.967
So please answer me this, Iris.

00:11:24.067 --> 00:11:25.637
Do thongs really deserve

00:11:25.737 --> 00:11:29.311
your absolute and
unwavering rejection?

00:11:30.313 --> 00:11:31.717
Iris?

00:11:31.817 --> 00:11:36.458
I wouldn't...
necessarily say "absolute."

00:11:36.559 --> 00:11:38.663
Then I will take them!
(Iris sighs)

00:11:38.763 --> 00:11:39.966
I'd like to buy this

00:11:40.066 --> 00:11:41.903
and a few of the same
in different patterns.

00:11:42.003 --> 00:11:45.343
Oh, and that g-string!
Can I try that on?

00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:48.082
[Iris] Oh, well.

00:11:50.955 --> 00:11:52.959
[students]
This way's no good either.
-Break it down!

00:11:53.059 --> 00:11:54.294
-Stop the fire from spreading.

00:11:54.394 --> 00:11:56.265
-If it goes underground,
it'll do more damage.

00:11:56.365 --> 00:11:58.469
-I found another one.
These wounds are deep.

00:11:58.570 --> 00:11:59.872
-Get him to the infirmary!

00:11:59.972 --> 00:12:02.645
It's a separate building.
The fire won't reach it.

00:12:02.745 --> 00:12:05.082
(Rose panting)

00:12:06.686 --> 00:12:08.891
(sad piano music)

00:12:08.991 --> 00:12:11.328
(people groaning)

00:12:14.602 --> 00:12:16.773
(gasps)

00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:20.346
[Rose] Cid Kageno...

00:12:22.852 --> 00:12:25.089
[Kagenou] <i>I'm dead.</i>

00:12:25.189 --> 00:12:26.425
Thank heavens.

00:12:26.526 --> 00:12:28.229
I'm so glad you're alive.

00:12:28.329 --> 00:12:33.006
Your unwavering effort and love
must have produced a miracle.

00:12:33.106 --> 00:12:37.514
I acknowledge and accept all of
your feelings for me.

00:12:37.615 --> 00:12:40.755
You sacrificed yourself
for my life.

00:12:40.855 --> 00:12:44.695
So now I...
I will give you my heart.

00:12:44.796 --> 00:12:47.000
(train chugging)

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:50.473
In that moment,
I felt the hand of destiny.

00:12:50.574 --> 00:12:53.513
My dear Cid, you are the one.

00:12:55.216 --> 00:12:58.923
[Kagenou] <i>Yeah,
I'm gonna need some space.</i>

00:12:59.024 --> 00:13:01.361
(train whistle)

00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:08.209
(monster roars)

00:13:08.309 --> 00:13:11.115
[Rose] We won't be arriving in
the Sacred Land for two days.

00:13:11.215 --> 00:13:13.887
So let's relax and
get plenty of rest.

00:13:13.988 --> 00:13:15.524
[Cid] Good idea.

00:13:15.625 --> 00:13:17.126
(happy chuckle)

00:13:19.097 --> 00:13:20.701
[Kagenou]
<i>The Sacred Land's so close</i>
(beasts yapping)

00:13:20.801 --> 00:13:23.339
<i>I could have just sprinted at
full speed and I'd be there.</i>

00:13:23.439 --> 00:13:25.277
<i>Taking an economy class seat
on the train</i>

00:13:25.377 --> 00:13:27.581
<i>like a proper
background character...</i>

00:13:27.681 --> 00:13:29.151
<i>Big mistake.</i>

00:13:29.251 --> 00:13:30.554
(sighs)

00:13:30.654 --> 00:13:31.590
Are you okay?

00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:33.993
I'm fine. It's nothing.

00:13:34.093 --> 00:13:35.897
[Kagenou] <i>She happened to find
me at the station.</i>

00:13:35.997 --> 00:13:37.167
<i>She said we should go together</i>

00:13:37.267 --> 00:13:39.471
<i>and wouldn't take
no for an answer.</i>

00:13:42.612 --> 00:13:43.847
[Rose] Say "when."

00:13:43.947 --> 00:13:45.449
[Cid] When.

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:57.508
[Rose]
I assume you're going for the
Goddess' Trial then, as well.

00:13:57.608 --> 00:14:00.614
Ah, yeah,
that would be correct.

00:14:00.714 --> 00:14:03.987
[Kagenou] <i>I figure that's what
Alpha summoned me for.</i>

00:14:04.087 --> 00:14:06.726
[Rose]
I've seen the real you, Cid.

00:14:06.826 --> 00:14:09.130
I know how very brave you are.

00:14:09.699 --> 00:14:10.901
I am quite certain

00:14:11.001 --> 00:14:13.707
that our path together
will be a thorny one.

00:14:13.807 --> 00:14:15.611
No one will give us
their blessing

00:14:15.711 --> 00:14:18.048
or approve of our union.

00:14:18.148 --> 00:14:20.587
[Kagenou] <i>The most popular
religion in this world</i>

00:14:20.688 --> 00:14:22.290
<i>is the Divine Teachings.</i>
(upbeat, slightly campy music)

00:14:22.390 --> 00:14:24.729
<i>It's a faith that worships
the sacred tenets</i>

00:14:24.829 --> 00:14:26.933
<i>of the goddess Beatrix.</i>

00:14:27.033 --> 00:14:28.937
[Rose] But it is said that
after the goddess granted

00:14:29.037 --> 00:14:30.942
the legendary
heroes her powers,

00:14:31.042 --> 00:14:32.878
they built up wealth
from humble beginnings

00:14:32.978 --> 00:14:35.149
and married the princesses
of great kingdoms.

00:14:35.249 --> 00:14:37.788
So I believe that at the end
of every thorny path,

00:14:37.888 --> 00:14:40.259
there awaits a blessed
and happy future.

00:14:40.359 --> 00:14:42.831
If you can make it through
the Goddess' Trial,

00:14:42.932 --> 00:14:44.334
I will be able to
speak to my father

00:14:44.434 --> 00:14:47.307
of an incredibly
brave young man.

00:14:47.407 --> 00:14:49.779
[Kagenou] <i>One of the holy sites
in these Divine Teachings</i>

00:14:49.879 --> 00:14:52.383
<i>is where we're headed now,
Lindwurm.</i>

00:14:52.483 --> 00:14:54.889
<i>It's where the goddess
descended upon the Earth</i>

00:14:54.989 --> 00:14:57.326
<i>to grant power
to three heroes.</i>

00:14:57.861 --> 00:14:59.097
<i>Supposedly.</i>

00:14:59.197 --> 00:15:00.867
We will follow this thorny path

00:15:00.968 --> 00:15:03.138
and overcome its
obstacles together.

00:15:03.239 --> 00:15:07.046
In consequence, our love will
be bound ever more tightly.

00:15:07.915 --> 00:15:10.186
<i>This is... THAT thing.</i>

00:15:10.286 --> 00:15:12.792
Unfortunately, we can't speak
of this to anyone yet,

00:15:12.892 --> 00:15:16.231
but let us do all that we can
for our bright, happy future.

00:15:16.331 --> 00:15:18.737
<i>[Kagenou]
Love, happiness, the future...</i>

00:15:18.837 --> 00:15:21.976
<i>It's such a typical cliché.</i>

00:15:22.076 --> 00:15:24.247
<i>She's trying to convert me
to her religion.</i>

00:15:24.348 --> 00:15:28.188
<i>Yeah,
I'm gonna need some space.</i>

00:15:32.063 --> 00:15:34.167
(giggles) Oh?

00:15:35.972 --> 00:15:41.381
[Kagenou]
<i>Somehow I evaded her nonstop,
two day, missionary efforts,</i>

00:15:41.481 --> 00:15:45.591
<i>and I finally arrived at the
Sacred Land of Lindwurm.</i>

00:15:45.691 --> 00:15:47.595
(church bell ringing)

00:15:47.695 --> 00:15:50.867
[priest] Just then, a black
rose shown in the night sky,

00:15:50.967 --> 00:15:53.272
and it's petals rained down
upon the warriors.

00:15:53.372 --> 00:15:54.809
The beautiful petals
fluttered down...

00:15:54.909 --> 00:15:57.147
[Cid] Why is every one
of these a left arm?

00:15:57.247 --> 00:16:00.019
Legend has it that this is
where the Hero Olivier

00:16:00.119 --> 00:16:03.025
caught off the left arm of the
Demon Diablos, long ago,

00:16:03.125 --> 00:16:06.700
and somewhere within the steep
mountains surrounding the
Sacred Land

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:08.837
are ruins known as
the Sanctuary.

00:16:08.937 --> 00:16:10.708
They say that is where
they have sealed away

00:16:10.808 --> 00:16:12.645
the left arm of Diablos.

00:16:12.745 --> 00:16:13.980
Yeah, that makes sense,

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:16.719
which would explain the
sword and left arm.

00:16:16.819 --> 00:16:18.355
[Rose] (gasps)
[Cid] Hmm?

00:16:19.758 --> 00:16:22.631
[Rose]
My favorite author, Natsume,
is having a book signing.

00:16:22.731 --> 00:16:24.467
I'm her biggest fan.

00:16:24.568 --> 00:16:25.336
[Cid] Natsume?

00:16:25.436 --> 00:16:26.505
[Rose] She's a popular novelist

00:16:26.606 --> 00:16:28.209
known for her
tremendous imagination

00:16:28.309 --> 00:16:30.413
and her fresh and original
world building.

00:16:30.514 --> 00:16:33.452
Romance, mystery, action,
fairy tales...

00:16:33.553 --> 00:16:36.091
She even writes literature
in the classic style.

00:16:36.191 --> 00:16:37.694
She's a master of every genre!

00:16:37.794 --> 00:16:39.097
And her stories are so diverse,

00:16:39.197 --> 00:16:40.734
it's like they're written
by different people.

00:16:40.834 --> 00:16:41.969
It's amazing!

00:16:42.069 --> 00:16:43.206
[Cid] Sounds like she
covers everything,

00:16:43.306 --> 00:16:44.542
almost like she's been rebo-

00:16:44.642 --> 00:16:48.049
Ah, I mean, nevermind.
I didn't say anything.

00:16:48.149 --> 00:16:50.687
[Cid] "The Mid-summer
Natsume Collection."

00:16:50.787 --> 00:16:53.125

No, can't read it.

00:17:18.744 --> 00:17:20.313
Huh...

[Kagenou] <i>The plagiarism is so
blatant it's almost refreshing.</i>

00:17:23.385 --> 00:17:24.922
<i>This can't be a coincidence.</i>

00:17:25.022 --> 00:17:28.697
<i>There must be someone else

<i>What does she think
she's doing?</i>

00:17:44.829 --> 00:17:46.498
Here, hand me your book.

00:17:53.078 --> 00:17:54.682
So how's business?

00:17:54.782 --> 00:17:56.185
Well, I really can't complain.

00:17:56.285 --> 00:17:58.657
My name's getting out there,
people know me,

00:17:58.757 --> 00:18:02.163
and it's all thanks to your
wisdom, my Lord.

00:18:02.263 --> 00:18:05.036
<i>First Gamma and now her?</i>

00:18:05.136 --> 00:18:06.706
<i>Beta told me she
likes literature.</i>

00:18:06.806 --> 00:18:10.446
<i>So I told her a few stories
from my past life.</i>

00:18:10.547 --> 00:18:13.085
<i>The idea was that she could
use them as inspiration</i>

00:18:13.185 --> 00:18:15.489
<i>to come up with a cool story.</i>

00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:17.628
<i>I didn't expect her to
steal them wholesale</i>

00:18:17.728 --> 00:18:18.930
<i>to make a profit.</i>

00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:20.767
[Natsume] Here you are.

00:18:20.867 --> 00:18:23.205
It contains all the
details of the mission.

00:18:23.305 --> 00:18:27.146
<i>Beta, Beta, Beta...
I'm disappointed in you.</i>

00:18:29.552 --> 00:18:32.658
[Rose] I didn't know you were a
fan of Natsume's work too.

00:18:32.758 --> 00:18:33.960
No, I just-

00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:35.196
Oh, look at this!

00:18:35.296 --> 00:18:36.899
She personalized it
with my name

00:18:36.999 --> 00:18:38.268
when she was signing
her autograph.

00:18:38.368 --> 00:18:40.006
[Kagenou] <i>Signing autographs,</i>

00:18:40.106 --> 00:18:41.576
<i>has she absolutely no shame?</i>

00:18:41.676 --> 00:18:44.915
So did you also get your
autograph personalized?

00:18:45.015 --> 00:18:47.253
Oh, now that you mention it...

00:18:48.488 --> 00:18:49.324
Hmm?

00:18:49.424 --> 00:18:51.295
Wait,
are those ancient letters?

00:18:51.395 --> 00:18:53.700
[Cid] Looks like it, yeah.
Can you read them?

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:56.105
[Rose] Ancient writing isn't
a required course,

00:18:56.205 --> 00:18:59.444
so I really only know
the very basics.

00:18:59.545 --> 00:19:01.114
And these letters look like

00:19:01.215 --> 00:19:03.286
they're written in
extreme shorthand.

00:19:03.386 --> 00:19:05.189
So I'm not sure if the meaning
would come across

00:19:05.289 --> 00:19:07.595
even if I could read it.
[Cid] Uh-huh...

00:19:07.695 --> 00:19:10.232
[Rose] But why would she write
in the ancient alphabet?

00:19:10.333 --> 00:19:12.203
Why would she...

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:16.044
Because it's cool, obviously.

00:19:16.144 --> 00:19:18.316
Because it's... it's cool?

00:19:18.416 --> 00:19:20.052
[Cid] Yeah, it's very cool.

00:19:20.153 --> 00:19:22.891
Yeah, very cool.

00:19:22.991 --> 00:19:26.364
I didn't realize that's the
kind of thing men were into.

00:19:31.475 --> 00:19:33.813
(sad orchestra music)

00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:40.927
It is time. We want to know the
truth, Great Hero Olivier.

00:19:41.028 --> 00:19:42.297
What did you really do
with the place

00:19:42.397 --> 00:19:44.000
they call the Sanctuary?

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:47.139
The more we unravel the threads
of history's darkness,

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:49.511
the more fact mingles
with fiction.

00:19:49.611 --> 00:19:52.016
Tell me, Archbishop Drake,

00:19:52.116 --> 00:19:55.289
what is it you were hiding
all this time?

00:19:55.389 --> 00:19:57.260
If you were only able to speak,

00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:59.631
I would love to hear
your answers.

00:20:00.266 --> 00:20:02.805
Who killed you?

00:20:02.905 --> 00:20:06.912
Would they dispose of a man
even of your high status?

00:20:07.012 --> 00:20:08.249
Tomorrow we wait for the moment

00:20:08.349 --> 00:20:10.654
that the door is
finally opened.

00:20:10.754 --> 00:20:11.823
(door opens)

00:20:11.923 --> 00:20:14.227
Your Grace, Archbishop Drake!

00:20:14.327 --> 00:20:16.164
(gasps) What sacrilege!

00:20:16.264 --> 00:20:18.035
[knight] Lock down the
cathedral at once!

00:20:18.135 --> 00:20:20.339
Don't let the murderer escape.

00:20:20.975 --> 00:20:23.311
(bells tolling)

00:20:26.719 --> 00:20:28.723
(Cid laughs)

00:20:28.823 --> 00:20:32.631
The bells ring out to announce
the arrival of chaos...

00:20:34.133 --> 00:20:35.838
and I look down on
the proceedings

00:20:35.938 --> 00:20:37.508
from my high vantage point.

00:20:37.608 --> 00:20:40.079
Yes, this is how I like it.

00:20:40.179 --> 00:20:41.515
Huh?

00:20:42.951 --> 00:20:45.757
(chuckles) I won't fault you
for making that choice,

00:20:45.857 --> 00:20:48.963
but it won't be enough to
change the ultimate outcome.

00:21:04.862 --> 00:21:06.999
(swords clang)

00:21:07.901 --> 00:21:09.772
(laughs)

00:21:09.872 --> 00:21:11.542
(assassin chokes)

00:21:12.844 --> 00:21:14.047
(schwing)

00:21:14.147 --> 00:21:15.650
(assassin groans)

00:21:17.821 --> 00:21:18.923
(blood splatters)

00:21:19.023 --> 00:21:22.030
The magically infused sword
strikes your victim...

00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:26.004
I must say I would expect
nothing less of Epsilon,
the Precise.

00:21:26.104 --> 00:21:27.439
I'm honored.

00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:29.310
[Cid] I got Alpha's letter.
(intricate guitar music)

00:21:29.410 --> 00:21:31.248
I mean, the mission.

00:21:31.348 --> 00:21:33.920
Yes, the mission,
how's it going?

00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:37.460
[Epsilon]
The target was eliminated by
the cult's executioner.

00:21:37.561 --> 00:21:38.730
We took out his henchman,

00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:41.000
but the executioner has
gone into hiding.

00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:43.773
An executioner? How cool!

00:21:43.873 --> 00:21:46.178
[Epsilon]
We are moving on to Plan B.

00:21:46.278 --> 00:21:47.714
So cool!

00:21:47.814 --> 00:21:50.687
Very well, then, but you do
know what that means, right?

00:21:50.787 --> 00:21:52.691
[Epsilon] We are prepared
for the consequences.

00:21:52.791 --> 00:21:55.329
I will proceed
with my own plans.

00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:56.699
Do not fail me.

00:21:56.799 --> 00:21:58.101
Sir.

00:22:06.150 --> 00:22:08.757
<i>Epsilon is a very proud woman.</i>

00:22:08.857 --> 00:22:12.631
<i>I can tell by the amount of
slime she's piled onto herself.</i>

00:22:21.147 --> 00:22:23.485
