WEBVTT

00:00:01.737 --> 00:00:04.074
(energy building)

00:00:08.584 --> 00:00:11.089
[council rep]
So then, with all that in mind,

00:00:11.189 --> 00:00:12.926
we of the Student Council
are always working

00:00:13.026 --> 00:00:15.263
to improve the lives
of all of our students,

00:00:15.364 --> 00:00:16.834
and we would like
to ask all of you

00:00:16.934 --> 00:00:18.738
to help us achieve that goal.

00:00:18.838 --> 00:00:21.375
We are not asking for
nominations of candidates.

00:00:21.475 --> 00:00:23.280
As I just explained,
this election will follow

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.752
the same pattern
as our standard...

00:00:25.852 --> 00:00:28.189
(tense music)

00:00:28.824 --> 00:00:29.726
(gasps)

00:00:29.827 --> 00:00:31.495
(door shatters)

00:00:32.265 --> 00:00:35.003
(students gasp)

00:00:35.104 --> 00:00:36.807
[fake shadow]
We are Shadow Garden,

00:00:36.908 --> 00:00:38.711
and we are taking over
this academy.

00:00:38.811 --> 00:00:40.782
<i>They went there.</i>

00:00:40.882 --> 00:00:42.852
<i>They seriously went there!</i>

00:00:42.952 --> 00:00:45.525
<i>This is what every young boy
in the world dreams of.</i>

00:00:45.625 --> 00:00:47.762
<i>The glorious event that
graces the first page</i>

00:00:47.862 --> 00:00:49.365
<i>of our adolescent fantasies.</i>

00:00:49.465 --> 00:00:53.407
<i>The dream of having your school
attacked by terrorists!</i>

00:00:53.508 --> 00:00:56.313
[Kagenou]
<i>They really, truly went there!</i>

00:00:56.413 --> 00:00:58.283
[Rose] ...hardly the act
of a sane person.

00:00:58.383 --> 00:01:00.888
<i>Infinite possibilities
now lie before me.</i>

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.224
[Rose] I refuse.

00:01:02.324 --> 00:01:03.694
[Kagenou] <i>What do I do?</i>

00:01:03.794 --> 00:01:06.266
[fake shadow] Then you'll
make the perfect example.

00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:09.238
[Kagenou] <i>What's my move?</i>

00:01:09.338 --> 00:01:12.111
[council rep] Miss President!
[Rose] What? My magic!

00:01:12.211 --> 00:01:13.948
<i>Magic obstruction?!</i>

00:01:14.048 --> 00:01:16.486
<i>A one-sided assault
from the terrorist.</i>

00:01:16.587 --> 00:01:20.261
<i>If they're following the stock
formula this beautifully,
then...</i>

00:01:20.361 --> 00:01:21.997
<i>They can't kill her!</i>

00:01:22.097 --> 00:01:23.868
[Kagenou]
<i>We've come too far for this!</i>

00:01:23.968 --> 00:01:25.505
<i>I can't let this happen!</i>

00:01:25.605 --> 00:01:28.343
<i>The first person in a class to
be killed by a terrorist...</i>

00:01:28.443 --> 00:01:31.650
<i>is a role that always belongs
to a background character!</i>

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:32.885
[Rose] Uh!

00:01:37.596 --> 00:01:39.298
<i>It's perfect.</i>

00:01:39.834 --> 00:01:42.137
(OPENING THEME)

00:03:17.361 --> 00:03:19.833
[Rose] Cid Kagenou...

00:03:25.978 --> 00:03:27.047
You fool!

00:03:27.147 --> 00:03:28.951
Why did you step
in front of me?

00:03:29.052 --> 00:03:31.388
(mournful music)

00:03:32.926 --> 00:03:34.428
(coughs)

00:03:36.366 --> 00:03:38.838
I'm... dead.

00:03:38.938 --> 00:03:40.440
(gasps)

00:03:46.987 --> 00:03:48.489
[Rose] Of course.

00:03:49.191 --> 00:03:50.828
I understand now.

00:03:50.928 --> 00:03:53.066
My sweet Cid, you...

00:03:53.166 --> 00:03:54.769
You cared for me.

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.180
You loved me so much you were
willing to give your life.

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.617
(gasps)

00:04:01.717 --> 00:04:03.754
We're going to the auditorium.

00:04:03.855 --> 00:04:06.125
If you don't want to
end up like him,

00:04:06.225 --> 00:04:07.863
you'll come along
without a fight.

00:04:07.963 --> 00:04:09.465
(soft growl)

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:16.011
Thank you,

00:04:17.381 --> 00:04:19.886
Cid Kagenou.

00:04:19.986 --> 00:04:22.324
(indistinct whispering)

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:45.304
(loud thud)
(metallic chime)

00:04:45.404 --> 00:04:47.073
(heartbeat)

00:04:49.078 --> 00:04:51.082
(loud thud)
(metallic chime)

00:04:51.182 --> 00:04:52.852
(heartbeat)

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:55.858
(loud thud)
(metallic chime)

00:04:55.959 --> 00:04:58.096
(heart beating)

00:04:58.196 --> 00:05:00.568
(loud thud)
(Cid gasping)

00:05:09.051 --> 00:05:10.522
That worked perfectly.

00:05:10.622 --> 00:05:12.223
The secret technique:

00:05:12.324 --> 00:05:14.797
The 10 Minute Death:
the Heartbreak.

00:05:14.897 --> 00:05:17.034
I use magic to control
the flow of my blood

00:05:17.134 --> 00:05:19.740
so I can maintain regular
blood flow to my brain,

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.877
even when my heart
has stopped beating.

00:05:21.977 --> 00:05:23.413
It's a high-risk move.
(heart beating)

00:05:23.514 --> 00:05:26.620
One wrong step and
it's hello afterlife.

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:30.160
As a background character,

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.199
there are times when I've got
to do what I've got to do,

00:05:33.299 --> 00:05:34.869
even if it could kill me.

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:37.609
Of course, my magic is
still being obstructed.

00:05:37.709 --> 00:05:42.518
Oh, well. It's fine as long as
I refine it to narrow threads.

00:05:44.455 --> 00:05:46.927
They did set up this whole
magic blocking scenario.

00:05:47.027 --> 00:05:49.666
It would just be rude
to ignore it, so...

00:05:51.168 --> 00:05:52.672
Okay...

00:05:53.472 --> 00:05:54.976
Let's go!

00:06:04.294 --> 00:06:05.363
(schwing)

00:06:05.464 --> 00:06:06.566
Yes, of course.

00:06:06.667 --> 00:06:08.370
It's laid out in
this sequence, so...

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:09.906
(swords clanging)

00:06:10.007 --> 00:06:12.143
(ominous music)

00:06:16.018 --> 00:06:18.155
(window shatters)

00:06:20.226 --> 00:06:21.897
Huh?

00:06:21.997 --> 00:06:23.499
Hah!

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:26.272
(gasps)

00:06:26.372 --> 00:06:28.810
We are Shadow Garden,
little one.

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:32.283
Wait, maybe we're called
the Shadow Guardians.

00:06:32.384 --> 00:06:33.987
Well, whatever.

00:06:34.088 --> 00:06:35.289
My name is Rex.

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:37.796
I am the great
Game of Betrayal, Rex,

00:06:37.896 --> 00:06:41.002
and my job is to retrieve
the pendant artifact.

00:06:41.102 --> 00:06:42.371
But when I'm done,

00:06:42.471 --> 00:06:45.878
my boss says I can wreak as
much havoc as I want.

00:06:45.978 --> 00:06:46.813
(Sherry whimpers)

00:06:46.913 --> 00:06:48.851
[Rex]
I can read you like a book.

00:06:48.951 --> 00:06:50.453
That really helps.

00:06:52.091 --> 00:06:54.261
Thanks a bunch, little lady.

00:06:54.361 --> 00:06:56.599
[Glen] Oh, no you don't!

00:06:57.502 --> 00:06:59.939
(swords clang)

00:07:00.039 --> 00:07:02.645
That's not so bad for a guy who
can't use his magic.

00:07:02.746 --> 00:07:04.816
Magic isn't the only
important thing.

00:07:04.916 --> 00:07:07.855
When your opponent is weaker,
it's easy to perry his attacks.

00:07:07.956 --> 00:07:10.460
"When your opponent is weaker,"
huh?

00:07:10.561 --> 00:07:12.431
(Rex laughing)

00:07:12.532 --> 00:07:16.239
So you think you can
overpower me, you crap bag?

00:07:16.339 --> 00:07:17.842
Damn right I can.

00:07:17.942 --> 00:07:19.277
[Rex] Hah!

00:07:19.378 --> 00:07:22.318
Then I guess I'll
ask you your name.

00:07:22.418 --> 00:07:23.687
Glen, the Lion's Mane,

00:07:23.788 --> 00:07:26.259
Vice Commander of
the Crimson Order.

00:07:26.359 --> 00:07:27.963
[Glen] Marco!
[Marco] Sir!

00:07:28.063 --> 00:07:29.298
Now, Sherry!

00:07:29.398 --> 00:07:31.002
This is your chance!

00:07:31.102 --> 00:07:32.605
(yells)

00:07:33.574 --> 00:07:35.077
(intense fighting)

00:07:35.177 --> 00:07:36.412
[Marco] Commander!

00:07:36.513 --> 00:07:38.850
(Rex laughing)

00:07:39.619 --> 00:07:41.956
(wind blowing)

00:07:46.165 --> 00:07:49.272
[Cid] They've rounded up all
the hostages in the auditorium.

00:07:49.372 --> 00:07:51.677
Good, the standard formula.

00:07:51.777 --> 00:07:53.713
Security is totally wiped out,

00:07:53.814 --> 00:07:56.653
and the Knight Order has
come running to provide
support.

00:07:56.753 --> 00:07:59.960
But with magic being blocked,
they hesitate to charge inside.

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:02.798
That's pretty cliche, too.
Not bad at all.

00:08:02.898 --> 00:08:05.203
We also have some of the
terrorists running around
the school

00:08:05.303 --> 00:08:07.575
to make sure there aren't any
more hidden students.

00:08:07.675 --> 00:08:10.581
Such a beautiful
sight to behold.

00:08:10.681 --> 00:08:13.119
Then there's me,
the Eminence in Shadow,

00:08:13.219 --> 00:08:16.527
looking very meaningfully
down on the proceedings.

00:08:16.627 --> 00:08:17.929
Magnificent!

00:08:18.029 --> 00:08:19.632
That's one more
thing that I can

00:08:19.732 --> 00:08:21.636
cross off the old bucket list.

00:08:22.738 --> 00:08:24.743
However,
they're not just sticking

00:08:24.843 --> 00:08:26.479
to the cookie cutter script,

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:28.784
they've added a fair amount
of originality to it.

00:08:28.884 --> 00:08:32.157
Which is good, but they have
no sense of aesthetics!

00:08:32.257 --> 00:08:34.428
Wearing all black
in the middle of the day?

00:08:34.529 --> 00:08:35.665
Have you no regard for the

00:08:35.765 --> 00:08:37.502
proper time,
place and occasion?

00:08:37.602 --> 00:08:38.871
Now you just look like losers

00:08:38.971 --> 00:08:40.508
who don't know how
to dress themselves!

00:08:40.608 --> 00:08:42.011
If you're going to wear
the long black coat,

00:08:42.111 --> 00:08:44.649
you do it at night.
Everybody knows that.

00:08:44.749 --> 00:08:45.785
If it's going to be like this,

00:08:45.885 --> 00:08:48.322
I'll play it slow
until nighttime.

00:08:49.626 --> 00:08:50.694
(phfew)

00:08:50.794 --> 00:08:53.132
(blood splattering)

00:08:53.934 --> 00:08:55.069
(phfew)

00:08:55.169 --> 00:08:57.474
I'll buy myself some time by
playing the little game

00:08:57.575 --> 00:08:58.911
of snipe the bad guys,

00:08:59.011 --> 00:09:01.717
and save my grand entrance
until after dark.

00:09:01.817 --> 00:09:03.987
Hmm... A pink haired idiot
running around,

00:09:04.088 --> 00:09:06.593
practically begging
to be captured.

00:09:07.494 --> 00:09:09.164
(Sherry gasps)

00:09:11.335 --> 00:09:13.573
Wait a minute, that's Sherry!

00:09:16.646 --> 00:09:17.715
(gasps)

00:09:17.815 --> 00:09:19.050
You're cute, Sherry.

00:09:19.151 --> 00:09:20.654
I know you think
you're being sneaky,

00:09:20.754 --> 00:09:22.290
but everyone can see you.
(phfew)

00:09:22.391 --> 00:09:23.894
(surprised gasp)

00:09:27.769 --> 00:09:29.772
Mission complete.

00:09:33.079 --> 00:09:34.081
Heh...

00:09:34.181 --> 00:09:36.418
My background character sense
is telling me

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:38.724
that the main story
is progressing.

00:09:38.824 --> 00:09:41.161
When the scenario gets
closer to its climax,

00:09:41.261 --> 00:09:44.301
the Eminence in Shadow will
make his dashing appearance.

00:09:44.401 --> 00:09:46.338
(gasping for breath)

00:09:46.438 --> 00:09:47.942
I love it.

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:53.218
<i>Now I leap dramatically from
the top of a building.</i>

00:09:53.319 --> 00:09:57.962
<i>And that's one more item to
cross off my bucket list.</i>

00:10:07.447 --> 00:10:08.517
[guard] Huh?

00:10:08.617 --> 00:10:10.186
(urk)

00:10:10.286 --> 00:10:11.556
(gasps)

00:10:11.657 --> 00:10:14.295
Oh good,
it was just my imagination.

00:10:14.395 --> 00:10:17.134
(struggling to breath)

00:10:17.234 --> 00:10:19.371
(campy spy music)

00:10:20.039 --> 00:10:21.208
He said...

00:10:21.308 --> 00:10:24.750
That's not so bad for a guy
who can't use his magic.

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:27.756
[Sherry] They must be
using THAT artifact,

00:10:27.856 --> 00:10:30.928
and that's why they
want to get this one.

00:10:31.028 --> 00:10:32.599
If I can get to father's room,

00:10:32.699 --> 00:10:35.037
there should be some documents
with more detail.

00:10:35.137 --> 00:10:36.205
(urk)

00:10:36.305 --> 00:10:38.409
(gasps)

00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:41.315
Oh, good,
it was just my imagination.

00:10:42.017 --> 00:10:44.354
(campy spy music continues)

00:10:49.666 --> 00:10:51.168
[guard] Hmm?

00:10:52.705 --> 00:10:54.241
(guard yelling)
(Sherry gasps)

00:10:54.341 --> 00:10:57.882
[Sherry] Oh, good,
it was just my imagination.

00:10:57.982 --> 00:11:00.319
(campy spy music continues)

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:13.813
(Sherry yelling)

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:19.124
[Cid] Are you all right?

00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:23.032
[Sherry] Cid...

00:11:25.738 --> 00:11:27.073
[Cid] Here you go.

00:11:27.173 --> 00:11:28.877
[Sherry] Thank you very much.

00:11:28.977 --> 00:11:31.448
Oh no! Cid, you're hurt!

00:11:31.549 --> 00:11:33.352
[Cid]
Ah, it's nothing. I'm fine.

00:11:33.452 --> 00:11:36.660
I just survived a near fatal
encounter, that's all.

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:37.895
But more importantly,

00:11:37.995 --> 00:11:39.733
I have a few things
I want to tell you.

00:11:39.833 --> 00:11:41.904
Like, let's not talk
out loud to ourselves.

00:11:42.004 --> 00:11:43.707
And let's stop trying
to figure things out

00:11:43.807 --> 00:11:45.243
and walk at the same time.

00:11:45.343 --> 00:11:47.849
And maybe pay attention to
where you're walking.

00:11:47.949 --> 00:11:50.754
But most of all...

00:11:50.854 --> 00:11:53.960
Let's take off those noisy
flip-flopping slippers.

00:11:55.798 --> 00:11:58.436
[Cid] I guess the assistant
principal isn't here.

00:11:58.537 --> 00:11:59.605
[Sherry] No.

00:11:59.706 --> 00:12:02.443
I hope he managed
to get out safely.

00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:06.986
I think this is
where he kept it.

00:12:07.086 --> 00:12:09.993
<i>I took out five more guys
on the way here.</i>

00:12:10.093 --> 00:12:13.099
<i>She really is the main
character of this story arc,</i>

00:12:13.199 --> 00:12:15.469
<i>but you can't get the good
ending on this story path</i>

00:12:15.571 --> 00:12:17.040
<i>with just her.</i>

00:12:17.141 --> 00:12:19.612
<i>There's supposed to be a
sidekick in these situations,</i>

00:12:19.712 --> 00:12:22.183
<i>but I don't see
any signs of one.</i>

00:12:22.283 --> 00:12:24.488
This scenario
is terribly flawed.

00:12:24.589 --> 00:12:26.693
[Sherry] I found it!

00:12:26.793 --> 00:12:28.028
[Cid] What is this?

00:12:28.128 --> 00:12:30.868
[Sherry] An artifact called
the Eye of Avaris.

00:12:30.968 --> 00:12:33.206
This is what's
blocking our magic.

00:12:33.306 --> 00:12:36.211
The Eye of Avaris can
absorb magical energy

00:12:36.312 --> 00:12:38.149
from any Dark Knight
or magical item

00:12:38.249 --> 00:12:41.857
within its range of efficacy
and store it temporarily.

00:12:41.957 --> 00:12:44.094
As a result, it becomes
difficult to shape

00:12:44.194 --> 00:12:46.533
any magical energy
while in its vicinity.

00:12:46.633 --> 00:12:50.173
[Cid]
But the guys in black were using
magic without any trouble.

00:12:50.273 --> 00:12:53.046
You can program it to remember
magical frequencies

00:12:53.146 --> 00:12:54.916
that you don't
want it to absorb.

00:12:55.016 --> 00:12:56.787
It has to have
a feature like that,

00:12:56.887 --> 00:12:58.757
or it would swallow up
the magic of anyone

00:12:58.857 --> 00:12:59.992
who was trying to use it.

00:13:00.093 --> 00:13:03.132
Yes, I see.
That's very interesting.

00:13:03.232 --> 00:13:05.036
So, does it absorb any magic

00:13:05.136 --> 00:13:06.940
that hasn't been recorded
in its memory?

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:08.309
[Sherry] I don't really know.

00:13:08.409 --> 00:13:10.614
I don't think it can
absorb magic traces

00:13:10.714 --> 00:13:12.017
that are too small to detect.

00:13:12.117 --> 00:13:14.021
And of course,
powerful spells that exceed

00:13:14.121 --> 00:13:16.459
the artifact's capacity
would be too much for it.

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:20.266
But there isn't any human alive
who can use THAT kind of magic.

00:13:20.366 --> 00:13:21.602
Oh yes, of course.

00:13:21.702 --> 00:13:22.939
If that was all there was to it,

00:13:23.039 --> 00:13:24.074
it would just be an artifact

00:13:24.174 --> 00:13:25.778
that's not very easy
to work with.

00:13:25.878 --> 00:13:27.949
But once the Eye of Avaris
has absorbed

00:13:28.049 --> 00:13:29.686
all the magical energy it can,

00:13:29.786 --> 00:13:31.723
apparently it releases it
all at once.

00:13:31.823 --> 00:13:35.664
[Cid] All at once?
[Sherry]
Yes, all of it in one big blast.

00:13:35.764 --> 00:13:37.635
Cid, you told me that
all the students

00:13:37.735 --> 00:13:38.937
have been gathered together

00:13:39.037 --> 00:13:41.208
and are being kept in the
auditorium, right?

00:13:41.308 --> 00:13:43.981
If they want to absorb magic
efficiently,

00:13:44.081 --> 00:13:46.151
they would put the
Eye of Avaris in a place

00:13:46.251 --> 00:13:48.991
where there would be a
large quantity of magic.

00:13:49.091 --> 00:13:51.128
In the auditorium where
they have most of

00:13:51.229 --> 00:13:53.299
the Academy's
Dark Knights captive.

00:13:53.399 --> 00:13:56.806
If the stored magic exceeds the
Eye of Avaris' capacity,

00:13:56.906 --> 00:13:59.178
and it releases
it all at once...

00:13:59.278 --> 00:14:00.213
(explosion)

00:14:00.313 --> 00:14:01.983
[Cid] It would blow
the school sky high.

00:14:02.083 --> 00:14:04.454
[Sherry]
Yes! Because of that high risk,

00:14:04.555 --> 00:14:07.427
Father chose not to publish
his findings in academia

00:14:07.528 --> 00:14:09.598
and he gave the Eye of Avaris
to the government

00:14:09.699 --> 00:14:11.068
for safekeeping.

00:14:11.168 --> 00:14:13.138
[Cid] Then either there's
another one just like it,

00:14:13.238 --> 00:14:15.242
or the first one's been stolen.

00:14:15.342 --> 00:14:17.681
All right then,
is there any way to fight it?

00:14:17.782 --> 00:14:20.086
Yes, with this.

00:14:20.186 --> 00:14:22.357
[Cid] Oh,
the flying saucer from before.

00:14:22.457 --> 00:14:26.132
[Sherry]
This artifact is the control
unit for the Eye of Avaris.

00:14:26.232 --> 00:14:29.639
I've been deciphering it and
I finally figured it out.

00:14:29.739 --> 00:14:31.275
Originally, the Eye of Avaris

00:14:31.375 --> 00:14:33.145
was meant to be used
with this one,

00:14:33.245 --> 00:14:36.620
as an artifact for long-term
magical storage.

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:38.055
Long-term storage?

00:14:38.155 --> 00:14:40.126
So wait, you're telling me
that you can stop it

00:14:40.226 --> 00:14:41.328
from releasing the energy?

00:14:41.428 --> 00:14:43.567
Yes! Exactly!
Isn't it incredible?

00:14:43.667 --> 00:14:46.673
It can effortlessly store and
operate magical energy.

00:14:46.773 --> 00:14:49.845
This technology could possibly
be a huge breakthrough.

00:14:49.946 --> 00:14:51.717
So then what are
you going to do now?

00:14:51.817 --> 00:14:52.851
Ah...

00:14:52.952 --> 00:14:54.020
[Sherry] Ahem...

00:14:54.121 --> 00:14:56.224
When I finish decoding
this artifact,

00:14:56.324 --> 00:14:58.863
then I will will head down to
the auditorium through
the basement.

00:14:58.963 --> 00:15:00.099
[Cid] The basement?

00:15:00.199 --> 00:15:01.435
[Sherry]
All of the academy's facilities

00:15:01.536 --> 00:15:03.472
are connected via
a series of hidden tunnels

00:15:03.573 --> 00:15:06.078
to use as an escape route
if there's an emergency.

00:15:06.178 --> 00:15:08.416
[Cid]
Hidden tunnels... I like it.

00:15:08.517 --> 00:15:10.286
[Sherry]
If I can activate the artifact

00:15:10.386 --> 00:15:12.323
and get it close to
the Eye of Avaris,

00:15:12.424 --> 00:15:15.062
that should stop it from
functioning.

00:15:15.162 --> 00:15:18.202
<i>That's a much more decent
plan than I expected.</i>

00:15:18.302 --> 00:15:19.672
<i>The last part's a little weak,</i>

00:15:19.772 --> 00:15:21.041
<i>but it should give me a chance</i>

00:15:21.141 --> 00:15:24.080
<i>to wreak some havoc as Shadow,
so whatever.</i>

00:15:24.181 --> 00:15:26.285
[Sherry] But...
I left all the tools

00:15:26.385 --> 00:15:29.124
I need to fine-tune the artifact
back in my study.

00:15:29.224 --> 00:15:30.861
How will I get them?

00:15:30.961 --> 00:15:32.363
[Cid] I can go get them.

00:15:32.463 --> 00:15:36.004
(gasps) No wait! I can't ask you
to do that! You're hurt!

00:15:36.105 --> 00:15:37.841
I have to go to
the bathroom anyway.

00:15:37.942 --> 00:15:39.244
It's on my way.

00:15:39.344 --> 00:15:40.647
'Kay?

00:15:41.482 --> 00:15:43.887
Oh, Cid.

00:15:43.987 --> 00:15:46.258
[Rex] Our academy takeover
is almost complete.

00:15:46.358 --> 00:15:48.362
The knights are buzzing
around outside,

00:15:48.463 --> 00:15:50.132
but they're nothing
to worry about.

00:15:50.232 --> 00:15:52.470
[Gaunt]
I don't care about any of that.

00:15:52.571 --> 00:15:55.176
Why haven't you
retrieved the artifact?

00:15:55.276 --> 00:15:57.380
Oh yes, of course,
the artifact.

00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:59.886
I'm pretty sure that little
pink haired girl has it.

00:15:59.986 --> 00:16:03.827
(chuckles) I have a general idea
of where to find it, so I- (urk)

00:16:03.927 --> 00:16:06.632
Do you have any idea
how much your antics

00:16:06.732 --> 00:16:09.070
have interfered with our plans?

00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:10.507
[Rex] Hey now, d-don't get mad.

00:16:10.607 --> 00:16:13.547
[Gaunt] One more slip-up
and I will kill you.

00:16:13.647 --> 00:16:15.584
Okay, okay! Don't get upset.

00:16:15.684 --> 00:16:17.420
I'll go get it right now.

00:16:18.857 --> 00:16:19.992
Oh, that reminds me.

00:16:20.092 --> 00:16:22.230
Somebody's taken out
not only our thirds,

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:23.700
but two of our seconds.

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:24.903
There's a real master fighter

00:16:25.003 --> 00:16:26.438
hiding somewhere
in this school.

00:16:26.539 --> 00:16:29.111
You think there's a chance it
might be you know who?

00:16:29.211 --> 00:16:30.446
[Gaunt] Shadow Garden...

00:16:30.548 --> 00:16:32.885
So you've finally
shown yourselves.

00:16:32.985 --> 00:16:36.057
I suggest you watch
your step from now on.

00:16:36.827 --> 00:16:38.128
[Gaunt] (hmphf)

00:16:38.228 --> 00:16:41.368
YOU tell ME to watch my step?

00:16:41.468 --> 00:16:44.975
Finally, all my ambitions
will be realized.

00:16:45.075 --> 00:16:48.516
I will be reinstated in the
Knights of Rounds.

00:16:48.616 --> 00:16:50.754
(laughing)

00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:03.613
(swoosh)
[all] Huh?!

00:17:05.050 --> 00:17:06.586
[both] (arrghh)

00:17:06.686 --> 00:17:08.055
(ominous choral music)

00:17:08.155 --> 00:17:09.725
What happened?

00:17:10.393 --> 00:17:13.566
Were we just attacked?

00:17:13.666 --> 00:17:14.602
Huh?

00:17:14.702 --> 00:17:16.338
(loud thud)

00:17:18.042 --> 00:17:19.244
[Rex] Son of a...

00:17:19.344 --> 00:17:21.047
You're too fast for me to see?

00:17:21.147 --> 00:17:23.318
Are you using an artifact
to boost your speed?

00:17:23.418 --> 00:17:26.158
In that case, face my net!

00:17:26.258 --> 00:17:28.495
You know what I just did?
I cast a net.

00:17:28.596 --> 00:17:30.499
I don't care how fast
you think you are,

00:17:30.601 --> 00:17:33.305
the second you get caught in my
net, it will let me know.

00:17:33.405 --> 00:17:35.611
How many more times
can you use that artifact

00:17:35.711 --> 00:17:36.913
before it wears you out?

00:17:37.013 --> 00:17:39.084
Two times,
maybe even three times.

00:17:39.184 --> 00:17:41.288
Your uniform is drenched in
blood, you're really-

00:17:41.388 --> 00:17:43.458
(waaah)
(loud thud)

00:17:48.269 --> 00:17:49.606
Son of a...

00:17:49.706 --> 00:17:51.207
(gaah)

00:17:53.846 --> 00:17:54.916
No way...

00:17:55.016 --> 00:17:56.351
You hit me from inside my net?

00:17:56.452 --> 00:17:58.523
But that's impossible.
You couldn't!

00:17:58.623 --> 00:17:59.625
You little punk...

00:17:59.725 --> 00:18:01.963
What the hell kind of artifact
are you using?

00:18:02.063 --> 00:18:03.499
(crash)

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:05.102
(gasps)

00:18:11.081 --> 00:18:12.584
(gasps)

00:18:14.488 --> 00:18:16.391
(dramatic musical crescendo)

00:18:16.491 --> 00:18:18.195
[Rex] What... What the...

00:18:18.897 --> 00:18:20.399
What is happening?

00:18:21.836 --> 00:18:23.774
What the hell?

00:18:23.874 --> 00:18:24.943
[Cid] Hey...

00:18:25.043 --> 00:18:27.246
You are truly awesome.

00:18:29.785 --> 00:18:31.622
(Rex yelling)

00:18:36.298 --> 00:18:39.337
[Nu] Even a prestigious
knight was no match.

00:18:40.841 --> 00:18:41.943
It ends all too quickly

00:18:42.043 --> 00:18:43.913
when their magic
is sealed away.

00:18:46.986 --> 00:18:48.656
Marco Grainger...

00:18:48.757 --> 00:18:51.428
So, you're in the
Crimson Order now.

00:19:00.479 --> 00:19:01.917
[Cid] What are you doing, Nu?

00:19:02.017 --> 00:19:04.320
[Nu] (gasps) Lord Shadow...

00:19:12.436 --> 00:19:14.274
This man was my betrothed.

00:19:14.374 --> 00:19:16.512
[Cid] Cool.
What are you gonna do to him?

00:19:16.612 --> 00:19:20.386
[Nu] I personally have no
reason to do anything to him.

00:19:20.486 --> 00:19:23.259
Then I think it's
okay to do nothing.

00:19:23.359 --> 00:19:26.098
Sorry for the delay,
but I have a report.
[Cid] 'Kay.

00:19:26.198 --> 00:19:27.868
Shadow Garden has
infiltrated the school,

00:19:27.968 --> 00:19:30.840
and we are now awaiting your
orders, Lord Shadow.

00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:33.880
They're ready to act as soon as
you give the word.
(dramatic music)

00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:35.082
[Cid] 'Kay.

00:19:35.182 --> 00:19:36.451
[Nu] But launching
an attack when magic

00:19:36.552 --> 00:19:39.892
has been restricted comes
with serious risks.

00:19:39.993 --> 00:19:43.098
Only the Seven Shadows can fight
at their standard levels.

00:19:43.198 --> 00:19:46.606
But the only one of them
currently in the capitol
is Gamma.

00:19:46.706 --> 00:19:51.882
And well, this sort of mission
isn't exactly her forte.

00:19:52.785 --> 00:19:55.322
[Cid] Right,
she has zero combat sense.

00:19:55.423 --> 00:19:57.426
[Nu] Ah... Yes.

00:19:57.527 --> 00:20:01.000
I myself cannot draw on even
half of my usual powers.

00:20:01.101 --> 00:20:02.470
[Cid] Oh, darn.

00:20:02.571 --> 00:20:05.577
Currently, Gamma has taken over
as General Commander.

00:20:05.677 --> 00:20:07.848
She predicts that the
restrictions on magical powers

00:20:07.948 --> 00:20:11.255
will be lifted before too long
and we will be at full strength.

00:20:11.355 --> 00:20:13.292
There have been no movements
from the cult.

00:20:13.392 --> 00:20:15.296
Now that they've sealed their
opponent's magic,

00:20:15.396 --> 00:20:16.666
they're making the most of
their advantage

00:20:16.766 --> 00:20:19.538
to build their defenses.
As for the Knights,

00:20:19.638 --> 00:20:21.442
the only ones who will be
of any use in battle

00:20:21.543 --> 00:20:22.778
would be Princess Iris

00:20:22.878 --> 00:20:25.049
and the reinforcements'
leading officers.

00:20:25.149 --> 00:20:26.351
But they have
a difference of opinion

00:20:26.451 --> 00:20:27.555
over who will take command

00:20:27.655 --> 00:20:29.559
due to the objections
from the palace.

00:20:29.659 --> 00:20:30.594
[Cid] I see.

00:20:30.694 --> 00:20:32.597
Our forces have been
instructed to wait

00:20:32.698 --> 00:20:35.904
until there's enemy movement,
or you direct us otherwise.

00:20:36.004 --> 00:20:37.207
Yeah...

00:20:37.307 --> 00:20:38.677
Oh, wait a minute.

00:20:38.777 --> 00:20:40.380
Do you know where
I might be able to find

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:41.749
the mythril tweezers?

00:20:41.850 --> 00:20:43.920
[Nu]
Oh, they're over here, my Lord.

00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:46.793
[Cid]
I'm also going to need the
powdered bone of Earth Dragon,

00:20:46.893 --> 00:20:48.629
Ashen Magicide and...

00:20:49.532 --> 00:20:51.268
[Cid]
Thanks, you've been a big help.

00:20:51.368 --> 00:20:52.605
[Nu] You're welcome.

00:20:52.705 --> 00:20:55.209
Might I ask what you
need all of this for?

00:20:55.309 --> 00:20:58.048
We're in the process of
fine-tuning an artifact.

00:20:58.148 --> 00:20:59.384
An artifact?

00:20:59.484 --> 00:21:01.054
Wait, you know how to do that?

00:21:01.154 --> 00:21:03.492
Yeah, what's happening is
our magic is being blocked

00:21:03.593 --> 00:21:06.030
by an artifact called
the Eye of Avaris,

00:21:06.131 --> 00:21:08.603
and we're in the final stages
of fine-tuning the artifact

00:21:08.703 --> 00:21:10.272
that can neutralize
this blockage.

00:21:10.372 --> 00:21:13.847
A task requiring the
greatest level of knowledge
in the kingdom.

00:21:13.947 --> 00:21:16.686
[Nu] You make it sound so easy.
[Cid] I guess so.

00:21:16.786 --> 00:21:19.725
I think we'll have it finished
by the time the sun goes down.

00:21:19.825 --> 00:21:21.763
Oh, then we will
make preparations

00:21:21.863 --> 00:21:24.301
to launch our attack
at that time, my Lord.

00:21:24.401 --> 00:21:25.771
[Cid]
I'm looking forward to it.

00:21:25.871 --> 00:21:27.373
[Nu] Yes, my Lord.

00:21:35.991 --> 00:21:37.961
(exasperated sigh)

00:21:38.061 --> 00:21:40.332
You've been spared another day.

00:21:48.148 --> 00:21:50.485
(tense techno music)

00:22:16.271 --> 00:22:17.707
Father, I need you.

00:22:17.808 --> 00:22:19.477
Please, help me.

00:22:21.247 --> 00:22:23.586
(ENDING THEME)
