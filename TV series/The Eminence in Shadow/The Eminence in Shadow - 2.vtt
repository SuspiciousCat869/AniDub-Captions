00:00:07.515 --> 00:00:10.788
[Kagenou] <i>I don't remember
how it started.</i>

00:00:10.888 --> 00:00:12.759
<i>As far back as I can remember,</i>

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.163
<i>it's what I always
wanted to be:</i>

00:00:15.263 --> 00:00:17.334
<i>The Eminence in Shadow.</i>

00:00:19.606 --> 00:00:20.675
Hello, Alpha.

00:00:20.775 --> 00:00:21.711
(tense music)

00:00:21.811 --> 00:00:22.980
Hello there.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.450
Everything you said
turned out to be true.

00:00:25.551 --> 00:00:27.188
I looked in those ancient texts

00:00:27.288 --> 00:00:29.893
and I found a description of
the Cult of Diablos.

00:00:29.994 --> 00:00:31.864
As I suspected.

00:00:31.964 --> 00:00:33.299
It seems the more we learn,

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.771
the more powerful
they appear to be.

00:00:36.907 --> 00:00:38.477
Nevertheless, I...

00:00:38.578 --> 00:00:41.584
We lurk in the shadows
and hunt the shadows.

00:00:41.684 --> 00:00:43.186
(gasps)

00:00:49.098 --> 00:00:52.405
<i>Yes, that's what I want.</i>

00:00:52.506 --> 00:00:56.546
<i>This is how I will finally
become the Eminence in Shadow.</i>

00:00:56.647 --> 00:01:00.020
<i>But man,
this elf is a pushover.</i>

00:01:00.121 --> 00:01:02.457
(OPENING THEME)

00:02:33.473 --> 00:02:35.645
<i>The last summer of my high
school career,</i>

00:02:35.745 --> 00:02:36.947
<i>I, Minoru Kageno,</i>

00:02:37.047 --> 00:02:39.485
<i>was on the path to become the
Eminence in Shadow</i>

00:02:39.586 --> 00:02:41.790
<i>when my journey was cut
drastically short.</i>

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.560
(whump)

00:02:45.932 --> 00:02:49.104
[Father] Claire always wanted
a little brother!

00:02:49.204 --> 00:02:52.044
She'll be overjoyed!

00:02:52.144 --> 00:02:53.581
[Kagenou] <i>What the hell?</i>

00:02:53.681 --> 00:02:55.852
But something's
not quite right.

00:02:55.952 --> 00:02:57.855
He never seems to cry.

00:02:57.956 --> 00:02:59.593
[Father] Hmm...

00:02:59.693 --> 00:03:01.830
(campy music)

00:03:03.934 --> 00:03:05.971
[Kagenou] <i>Oh, I get it now.</i>

00:03:06.072 --> 00:03:08.010
("baby" crying)

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.013
[Father] What a hearty cry!

00:03:10.113 --> 00:03:12.519
Oh, I must have been
imagining things.

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:16.259
[Kagenou] <i>I have no idea how or
why this could have happened,</i>

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:18.797
<i>but that's just a minor detail.</i>

00:03:20.133 --> 00:03:21.336
<i>More importantly,</i>

00:03:21.436 --> 00:03:24.676
<i>the air is filled
with magical energy.</i>

00:03:24.776 --> 00:03:25.912
<i>In my past life,</i>

00:03:26.012 --> 00:03:28.684
<i>magic was the stuff of dreams
and fairy tales.</i>

00:03:28.784 --> 00:03:32.559
<i>But now I could claim this
overwhelming power for my own.</i>

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:35.397
<i>That's the only thing
that matters.</i>

00:03:35.497 --> 00:03:37.034
<i>With this power, I can-</i>

00:03:37.134 --> 00:03:38.504
(music ends)

00:03:38.604 --> 00:03:40.206
<i>Uh oh...</i>

00:03:40.306 --> 00:03:41.877
(all gasp)

00:03:42.512 --> 00:03:43.881
[Kagenou] <i>Ah...</i>

00:03:43.981 --> 00:03:45.116
<i>I pooped.</i>

00:03:45.217 --> 00:03:47.555
("baby" crying)

00:03:48.791 --> 00:03:51.597
[Kagenou] <i>So I was reborn
as the son of Baron Kagenou,</i>

00:03:51.697 --> 00:03:53.567
<i>an aristocrat living out
in the boonies.</i>

00:03:53.667 --> 00:03:56.406
<i>For generations, this family
has pumped out Dark Knights,</i>

00:03:56.507 --> 00:03:59.378
<i>fencers that enhance their
physical abilities with magic.</i>

00:03:59.479 --> 00:04:01.016
(rock cracking)

00:04:01.116 --> 00:04:03.854
[Kagenou] <i>And everyone has high
hopes for the Kagenou heir,</i>

00:04:03.955 --> 00:04:06.025
<i>who is not me.</i>

00:04:06.125 --> 00:04:08.496
(sword slashing)
(rock shattering)

00:04:11.368 --> 00:04:12.470
[Kagenou] <i>Hidden in the shadow</i>

00:04:12.572 --> 00:04:14.242
<i>of my abundantly
talented sister,</i>

00:04:14.342 --> 00:04:16.079
<i>I grew up as the
average, ordinary</i>

00:04:16.179 --> 00:04:17.548
<i>Dark Knight in training -</i>

00:04:17.648 --> 00:04:19.452
<i>Background Character A.</i>

00:04:19.553 --> 00:04:21.489
<i>But under that exterior....</i>

00:04:23.092 --> 00:04:25.163
(laughing)

00:04:25.263 --> 00:04:26.834
(blood squirting)

00:04:26.934 --> 00:04:29.540
I see business is booming,
my dear bandits!

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.211
Then kindly show me
all of your valuables.

00:04:32.311 --> 00:04:34.616
Don't you dare get cocky
with us, you twerp!

00:04:34.716 --> 00:04:35.852
(bang!)

00:04:35.952 --> 00:04:37.121
Did he just?

00:04:37.221 --> 00:04:40.160
[Shadow] You there,
enough idol chit-chat.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.299
I told you to
hand over the money.

00:04:43.399 --> 00:04:45.236
(sword slashing)
(blood spattering)

00:04:45.337 --> 00:04:47.509
(dramatic music)

00:04:47.609 --> 00:04:49.278
This is my slime sword.

00:04:49.378 --> 00:04:51.048
It's nice, isn't it?

00:04:53.353 --> 00:04:54.889
(sword slashing)

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.396
Wow, this is even more useful
than I thought it would be.

00:04:58.496 --> 00:04:59.999
What? Wait a minute.

00:05:01.102 --> 00:05:02.104
All right, fine.

00:05:02.204 --> 00:05:03.473
Next!
(boom)

00:05:03.574 --> 00:05:06.279
I can test THIS sword on you.
(bandit grunts)

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:07.481
[Shadow]
If you really work at it,

00:05:07.582 --> 00:05:10.087
you can survive
about two minutes.

00:05:10.187 --> 00:05:11.322
So hang in there.

00:05:11.422 --> 00:05:12.825
(gasps)

00:05:12.925 --> 00:05:14.428
Don't mock me, boy.

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:17.334
Surprised? I might not look
like much at first,

00:05:17.434 --> 00:05:19.706
but I'm a Bu Shinru master!

00:05:23.079 --> 00:05:24.782
I'm just kidding.

00:05:25.417 --> 00:05:26.452
(blood spraying)

00:05:26.553 --> 00:05:29.425
You can't survive
for two minutes.

00:05:29.526 --> 00:05:31.028
And yes, I'm really happy

00:05:31.128 --> 00:05:33.366
with this slime bodysuit too.

00:05:34.468 --> 00:05:37.909
My caravan friends,
I have avenged you.

00:05:38.443 --> 00:05:39.646
(wood shattering)

00:05:39.746 --> 00:05:42.284
Don't worry, my friends,
I will make good use

00:05:42.384 --> 00:05:44.255
of the gifts you've left behind.

00:05:44.355 --> 00:05:47.093
Money, art, food and...

00:05:47.193 --> 00:05:48.096
(rattling)

00:05:48.196 --> 00:05:49.264
Hmm?

00:05:49.365 --> 00:05:51.035
(more rattling)

00:05:52.271 --> 00:05:54.609
A cage? That's weird.

00:05:59.318 --> 00:06:01.523
Is it a slave?

00:06:02.324 --> 00:06:03.660
You're not a corpse.

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.332
You've started to rot,
but you're still alive,

00:06:06.432 --> 00:06:07.568
which means...

00:06:07.668 --> 00:06:09.672
you're possessed?
(electrical discharge)

00:06:10.541 --> 00:06:11.977
That wavelength...

00:06:12.077 --> 00:06:13.346
I've felt it before.

00:06:13.446 --> 00:06:15.752
It's just like a magical
overload.

00:06:15.852 --> 00:06:17.454
Ah...

00:06:18.289 --> 00:06:19.926
(electrical discharges)

00:06:20.026 --> 00:06:22.398
(loud thundering)

00:06:22.498 --> 00:06:25.070
Oh, I can make
use of this blob.

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:26.640
It's not my body,

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:30.046
so I can do anything I want
with it without hurting myself.

00:06:30.146 --> 00:06:32.885
[Kagenou] <i>After that, I started
shooting it up with magic.</i>

00:06:32.985 --> 00:06:35.023
<i>I tried all kinds of things
that didn't work,</i>

00:06:35.123 --> 00:06:38.263
<i>but the experimentation
was exhilarating.</i>

00:06:38.363 --> 00:06:40.466
<i>Then, one month later,</i>

00:06:41.102 --> 00:06:42.237
<i>I finally succeeded</i>

00:06:42.337 --> 00:06:44.742
<i>in containing the
magical overload.</i>

00:06:46.245 --> 00:06:47.782
<i>But...</i>

00:06:55.463 --> 00:06:57.000
Oh, my lord...

00:06:59.706 --> 00:07:02.745
Something that decomposed can
go back to normal?

00:07:03.914 --> 00:07:05.383
(mmm)

00:07:05.484 --> 00:07:08.256
[Kagenou]
<i>Uh oh, what do I do now?</i>

00:07:08.356 --> 00:07:10.460
<i>Oh, I have an idea.</i>

00:07:11.162 --> 00:07:12.263
<i>Stay sharp.</i>

00:07:12.363 --> 00:07:13.400
<i>This is your first performance</i>

00:07:13.501 --> 00:07:15.136
<i>as the Eminence in Shadow.</i>

00:07:15.939 --> 00:07:17.576
(clears throat)

00:07:17.676 --> 00:07:19.812
I see you've awakened.

00:07:20.948 --> 00:07:22.450
(small sigh)

00:07:23.554 --> 00:07:24.790
(gasps) What?

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:26.760
But this can't be happening.

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:28.163
I'm...

00:07:28.263 --> 00:07:29.532
[Shadow]
I have broken the curse

00:07:29.632 --> 00:07:32.237
that was gnawing away at you.

00:07:32.337 --> 00:07:34.509
You're free now,
back to normal.

00:07:35.243 --> 00:07:36.980
What do you mean?

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:38.650
You did this?

00:07:39.085 --> 00:07:40.286
What curse?

00:07:40.386 --> 00:07:43.259
Yes, it was a curse that was...

00:07:43.359 --> 00:07:44.863
a terrible curse that was cast

00:07:44.963 --> 00:07:46.834
upon all the hero's
descendants.

00:07:46.934 --> 00:07:49.371
I understand your
consternation.

00:07:49.471 --> 00:07:52.044
But surely,
you too have heard the tale.

00:07:52.144 --> 00:07:53.346
Here it is.

00:07:53.446 --> 00:07:55.183
The fairy tale recorded
in these scriptures

00:07:55.283 --> 00:07:58.422
about three heroes who
defeated the Demon Diablos

00:07:58.523 --> 00:08:00.961
and saved the world.

00:08:01.061 --> 00:08:03.733
That story is true.
(woman gasps)

00:08:03.834 --> 00:08:07.374
[Shadow] And the demon with his
dying breath cast a curse.

00:08:07.474 --> 00:08:11.115
That is what really turned you
into the rotting lump of flesh.

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:13.988
But someone has twisted history

00:08:14.088 --> 00:08:18.028
and turned you into objects of
scorn, calling you possessed.

00:08:18.496 --> 00:08:20.333
(gasps)

00:08:20.433 --> 00:08:23.039
[Shadow]
And the one behind it all is...

00:08:24.274 --> 00:08:27.782
Yes, the mastermind is...

00:08:27.883 --> 00:08:29.552
No, it's too soon
to speak the name.

00:08:29.652 --> 00:08:31.488
If you knew it,
you would only be in danger.

00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:33.460
[woman] I don't care.
[Shadow] Huh?

00:08:33.561 --> 00:08:35.029
Tell me who did this to me.

00:08:35.129 --> 00:08:36.399
Oh, I see.

00:08:36.499 --> 00:08:39.740
Uh... In that case,
I guess I'll tell you.

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:40.708
Ah...

00:08:40.808 --> 00:08:42.311
(wishpering)
The Cult of Diablos...

00:08:42.411 --> 00:08:43.614
(gasps)

00:08:43.714 --> 00:08:45.149
[Shadow] A group of zealots
who are plotting

00:08:45.249 --> 00:08:47.054
to revive the great demon.

00:08:47.154 --> 00:08:50.427
They never come out
into the light of day.

00:08:50.528 --> 00:08:52.732
My mission is to
remain in the shadows

00:08:52.832 --> 00:08:54.435
to end their evil schemes,

00:08:54.536 --> 00:08:56.272
I guess.

00:08:56.372 --> 00:08:59.044
Yes, my name is Stylish.

00:08:59.378 --> 00:09:00.447
Sorry.

00:09:00.548 --> 00:09:03.119
No, my name is Shadow.

00:09:03.219 --> 00:09:06.726
He who lurks in the shadows
to hunt the shadows.

00:09:08.096 --> 00:09:09.800
[woman] Shadow?

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:12.137
My path is not an easy one,

00:09:12.237 --> 00:09:15.176
but it's necessary to
fulfill my mission.

00:09:16.579 --> 00:09:18.482
Child of the heroes,

00:09:18.583 --> 00:09:21.088
are you prepared to walk
my path with me?

00:09:22.291 --> 00:09:24.161
When I became ill,

00:09:24.261 --> 00:09:27.969
or rather when I was struck
with this horrible curse,

00:09:28.069 --> 00:09:29.271
I lost everything.

00:09:29.371 --> 00:09:33.279
My only future was to waste
away as a hideous beast.

00:09:33.379 --> 00:09:35.049
But you saved me.

00:09:35.149 --> 00:09:41.028
So if it is what you wish,
I will give you my life.

00:09:41.128 --> 00:09:43.800
And I will punish the
guilty with death.

00:09:44.468 --> 00:09:45.804
Uhmm!

00:09:47.909 --> 00:09:49.244
Uhmm!

00:09:49.344 --> 00:09:52.685
[Kagenou] <i>So yeah, I made the
whole thing up.</i>

00:09:53.688 --> 00:09:54.923
[Shadow]
We'll probably be up against

00:09:55.023 --> 00:09:57.093
some very powerful
government leaders.

00:09:57.193 --> 00:09:59.665
But I'm sure there'll be many
people under their control

00:09:59.765 --> 00:10:01.134
that don't know the truth.

00:10:01.234 --> 00:10:04.676
So what? I'll show no mercy to
any who stand our way.

00:10:04.776 --> 00:10:07.114
Yes, good! That's the spirit!

00:10:07.214 --> 00:10:09.619
[woman] We will need to find
the other hero descendants

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:11.990
and take them under our
protection.

00:10:12.091 --> 00:10:13.527
Huh? Uh, right.

00:10:13.627 --> 00:10:15.197
As we expand our organization,

00:10:15.297 --> 00:10:17.735
we'll need to strengthen
our base of operations.

00:10:17.835 --> 00:10:19.739
We'll need to collect funds
to that end.

00:10:19.839 --> 00:10:21.877
Yeah, but in moderation.

00:10:21.977 --> 00:10:23.981
[Shadow] Right, then, okay.

00:10:24.081 --> 00:10:26.151
We'll call our organization...

00:10:27.287 --> 00:10:29.158
Shadow Garden.

00:10:29.258 --> 00:10:32.096
And the name you shall
answer to is Alpha.

00:10:35.737 --> 00:10:37.742
[Kagenou] <i>Three years passed
after I brilliantly</i>

00:10:37.842 --> 00:10:40.246
<i>ad-libbed my way through
my first performance.</i>

00:10:40.346 --> 00:10:41.683
<i>I was now 13 years old.</i>

00:10:41.783 --> 00:10:44.321
<i>An average, ordinary,
Dark Knight in training.</i>

00:10:44.421 --> 00:10:46.058
(loud bang)

00:10:46.158 --> 00:10:48.195
(Cid yelling)

00:10:49.097 --> 00:10:50.834
(swords clang)

00:10:50.934 --> 00:10:52.538
Your lunge is weak!

00:10:52.638 --> 00:10:53.674
(Cid yelling)

00:10:53.774 --> 00:10:54.775
[Kagenou] <i>Fencing in this world,</i>

00:10:54.875 --> 00:10:57.080
<i>in a word, is unsophisticated.</i>

00:10:58.249 --> 00:11:00.486
<i>In my past life, living in
the age of information,</i>

00:11:00.588 --> 00:11:03.259
<i>I was able to fuse all kinds of
martial arts together</i>

00:11:03.359 --> 00:11:04.461
<i>and optimize them.</i>

00:11:04.563 --> 00:11:06.465
<i>If I could just
use them here...</i>

00:11:08.837 --> 00:11:10.140
(sword thunders)
(Cid yells)

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:11.910
(water splashing)

00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:16.385
(whining) Oh, come on!

00:11:16.485 --> 00:11:19.157
You're too strong,
this isn't fair.

00:11:20.126 --> 00:11:23.534
That boy never makes
any progress.

00:11:23.634 --> 00:11:24.736
[servant] Miss Claire!

00:11:24.836 --> 00:11:26.138
What can I do for you?

00:11:26.238 --> 00:11:27.976
[servant]
Your mother is calling.

00:11:28.076 --> 00:11:31.482
The guests are arriving for
your farewell party.

00:11:31.583 --> 00:11:34.354
Cid, I won't be able to
practice with you for a while,

00:11:34.454 --> 00:11:37.528
but make sure to continue
training on your own.
[Cid] Yes, ma'am!

00:11:37.628 --> 00:11:39.464
[Claire] You, prepare a towel
and a change of clothes

00:11:39.565 --> 00:11:41.202
for the boy.
[Kagenou] <i>Oh, man...</i>

00:11:41.302 --> 00:11:43.740
<i>It's not easy to play the part
of a background character,</i>

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:46.078
<i>but I must play Background
Character A perfectly</i>

00:11:46.178 --> 00:11:49.117
<i>if I want to be ready for the
day I know will come.</i>

00:11:50.721 --> 00:11:52.525
(Cid sneezes)

00:11:52.625 --> 00:11:54.027
(bell tolling)

00:11:54.127 --> 00:11:55.631
[Kagenou] <i>When Nobles turn 15,</i>

00:11:55.731 --> 00:11:58.436
<i>they start attending the
Midgar Academy for Dark Knights</i>

00:11:58.537 --> 00:12:00.674
<i>in the Royal Capitol.</i>

00:12:00.774 --> 00:12:02.511
<i>My sister is enrolled at
the Midgar Academy</i>

00:12:02.611 --> 00:12:04.782
<i>for Dark Knights too, but...</i>

00:12:05.283 --> 00:12:07.420
(ominous music)

00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:11.830
<i>When the day came
for her departure,</i>

00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:14.067
<i>she was nowhere to be found.</i>

00:12:16.807 --> 00:12:18.577
[Father]
What is the meaning of this?!

00:12:18.677 --> 00:12:20.180
Even if they attacked her
in her sleep,

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:22.350
how could they ever
overpower Claire?!

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:25.223
The dirty bastard must have
been a master fighter!

00:12:25.323 --> 00:12:27.127
[Mother]
Then we have to accept this?!

00:12:27.227 --> 00:12:27.929
Uuhh...

00:12:28.029 --> 00:12:29.130
Is that what you're saying?

00:12:29.231 --> 00:12:30.834
[Father]
No, that's not what I meant.

00:12:30.934 --> 00:12:32.605
I was just stating a fact.

00:12:32.705 --> 00:12:35.042
[Mother]
Stop making excuses, bald man!

00:12:35.143 --> 00:12:36.411
Take that and that!
(loud punching)

00:12:36.512 --> 00:12:39.018
[Father] Ow! I'm sorry!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

00:12:39.118 --> 00:12:41.556
[Mother] Go find our daughter
right now, dammit!

00:12:41.656 --> 00:12:43.894
What are we going to do if
something happens to Claire?!

00:12:43.994 --> 00:12:45.698
[Father] Wh-what are you going
to do with that?

00:12:45.798 --> 00:12:47.635
I need you, Beta.

00:12:47.735 --> 00:12:49.171
What do you need, Lord Shadow?

00:12:49.271 --> 00:12:51.275
[Kagenou] <i>Alpha had collected
members for Shadow Garden</i>

00:12:51.375 --> 00:12:53.881
<i>as if she was adopting
abandoned kittens.</i>

00:12:53.981 --> 00:12:56.451
<i>So our numbers grew
quite rapidly.</i>

00:12:56.553 --> 00:12:57.688
Where is Alpha?

00:12:57.788 --> 00:12:58.857
Searching for clues

00:12:58.957 --> 00:13:00.695
in order to find Miss Claire.

00:13:00.795 --> 00:13:02.330
[Cid] She moves fast.

00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:03.734
Is my sister still alive?

00:13:03.834 --> 00:13:05.203
[Beta] Most likely, yes.

00:13:05.303 --> 00:13:08.042
The kidnapper belongs to
the Cult of Diablos,

00:13:08.142 --> 00:13:09.612
a high ranking officer.

00:13:09.712 --> 00:13:11.214
Why'd they take my sister?

00:13:11.315 --> 00:13:12.952
We believe they suspect
Miss Claire

00:13:13.052 --> 00:13:14.789
is one of the
hero's descendants.

00:13:14.889 --> 00:13:16.425
I understand now.

00:13:16.526 --> 00:13:18.362
[Kagenou] <i>I guess when these
girls get involved</i>

00:13:18.462 --> 00:13:19.666
<i>even regular old bandits</i>

00:13:19.766 --> 00:13:21.035
<i>can be considered members
of the cult.</i>

00:13:21.135 --> 00:13:23.139
[Beta] Please have a
look at this map.

00:13:23.239 --> 00:13:26.078
We have determined the
locations of their hideouts,

00:13:26.178 --> 00:13:27.413
but we don't know which hideout

00:13:27.514 --> 00:13:30.086
is the one where they are
keeping Miss Claire.

00:13:30.186 --> 00:13:31.321
Hmphf!

00:13:31.756 --> 00:13:32.658
That one.

00:13:32.758 --> 00:13:33.694
(thunk)

00:13:33.794 --> 00:13:35.463
[Kagenou] <i>Dammit, I missed.</i>

00:13:35.564 --> 00:13:36.966
That is where we'll find her.

00:13:37.066 --> 00:13:38.637
(small gasp) But...

00:13:38.737 --> 00:13:40.675
but there's nothing
there on the map.

00:13:40.775 --> 00:13:41.877
(Beta gasps)

00:13:41.977 --> 00:13:43.045
It can't be!

00:13:43.145 --> 00:13:45.015
These cryptograms were a bluff?

00:13:45.115 --> 00:13:47.989
In that case, if we compare it
against this account,

00:13:48.089 --> 00:13:49.592
it all comes together!

00:13:49.692 --> 00:13:50.727
Look, Lord Shadow!

00:13:50.827 --> 00:13:52.063
I believe there is
a secret hideout

00:13:52.163 --> 00:13:54.803
in the location you indicated.
[Cid] I know.

00:13:54.903 --> 00:13:56.640
You took in this huge amount
of information

00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:58.576
and saw the truth immediately.

00:13:58.677 --> 00:13:59.913
You're amazing!

00:14:00.013 --> 00:14:01.481
[Kagenou]
<i>You're quite the actress, Beta.</i>

00:14:01.582 --> 00:14:03.485
<i>You deserve an Academy Award.</i>

00:14:04.021 --> 00:14:05.591
[Cid] Hmphf!

00:14:05.691 --> 00:14:07.594
Call the Seven Shadows.

00:14:07.695 --> 00:14:09.164
We move tonight.

00:14:09.264 --> 00:14:10.399
Right!

00:14:13.372 --> 00:14:16.646
[man] You know,
I had a daughter.

00:14:16.747 --> 00:14:21.021
I would prefer not to have to
resort to such violent ways,

00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:23.325
Claire Kagenou.

00:14:24.128 --> 00:14:25.931
(stone cracking)

00:14:26.031 --> 00:14:27.166
[man] You can still dodge that

00:14:27.266 --> 00:14:29.605
while locked up in
magic sealing chains?

00:14:29.705 --> 00:14:32.477
I was taught that it's not
about how much magic you have,

00:14:32.578 --> 00:14:33.681
but how you use it.

00:14:33.781 --> 00:14:35.617
Your father is a smart man.

00:14:35.718 --> 00:14:36.953
That old baldy?

00:14:37.053 --> 00:14:39.525
It was my brother
who taught me.

00:14:39.625 --> 00:14:41.162
Your brother?

00:14:41.262 --> 00:14:44.033
When we fight each other,
I beat him every time.

00:14:44.133 --> 00:14:45.637
That being said, I'm constantly

00:14:45.737 --> 00:14:47.542
learning from my brother's sword

00:14:47.642 --> 00:14:48.777
and yet strangely,

00:14:48.877 --> 00:14:50.446
he never seems to learn
a thing from me.

00:14:50.547 --> 00:14:53.118
And that's why I
pick on him every day.

00:14:53.218 --> 00:14:54.822
I've heard all about
your brother.

00:14:54.923 --> 00:14:56.391
When you showed signs
of possession

00:14:56.491 --> 00:14:59.532
he was the one that healed you,
is that not true?

00:14:59.632 --> 00:15:01.034
Oh god, not that again.

00:15:01.134 --> 00:15:02.871
That's not how
it happened at all.

00:15:02.971 --> 00:15:04.909
There's no way that boy
could have healed me.

00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:06.646
[man]
That may be, but just in case,

00:15:06.746 --> 00:15:09.519
I'm going to need to learn more
about this brother of yours.

00:15:09.619 --> 00:15:10.521
(Claire gasps)

00:15:10.621 --> 00:15:12.123
(chain snaps)

00:15:13.359 --> 00:15:15.731
If anything happens
to that boy,

00:15:15.831 --> 00:15:17.133
you'll have to answer to me!

00:15:17.233 --> 00:15:19.539
What have you done?
You mutilated your own hands?

00:15:19.639 --> 00:15:20.707
I'll kill you!

00:15:20.807 --> 00:15:21.876
I'll kill your beloved family,

00:15:21.976 --> 00:15:23.412
your friends, everyone you know,

00:15:23.513 --> 00:15:24.682
I'll kill them all!

00:15:24.782 --> 00:15:25.984
(loud punch)

00:15:26.085 --> 00:15:27.588
(Claire groans)

00:15:29.024 --> 00:15:30.660
Stupid little bitch....

00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:31.696
No matter.

00:15:31.796 --> 00:15:33.065
We'll know if she's compatible

00:15:33.165 --> 00:15:34.769
once we've analyzed her blood.

00:15:34.869 --> 00:15:35.737
Master Grease!

00:15:35.837 --> 00:15:36.773
What the hell do you want?

00:15:36.873 --> 00:15:37.942
[page] Intruders!

00:15:38.042 --> 00:15:39.044
(gasps)

00:15:39.144 --> 00:15:41.448
(guns banging)
(electronic music)

00:15:42.183 --> 00:15:43.452
(swords clanging)

00:15:43.553 --> 00:15:44.956
[page] We think there
are seven of them.

00:15:45.056 --> 00:15:47.327
They appeared out of nowhere
like shadows.

00:15:47.427 --> 00:15:49.464
Our men are dropping
like flies.

00:15:49.565 --> 00:15:51.035
We're no match for them!

00:15:51.135 --> 00:15:52.270
[Grease] That's impossible!

00:15:52.371 --> 00:15:53.707
Some of our knights
are good enough

00:15:53.807 --> 00:15:55.610
to be in the Royal Guard.

00:15:55.711 --> 00:15:56.813
(blood spatters)

00:15:56.913 --> 00:15:58.617
(gasps) How could this...

00:15:58.717 --> 00:16:01.054
(musical crescendo)

00:16:03.025 --> 00:16:04.963
(choral music)

00:16:05.063 --> 00:16:06.766
[Grease] Y-you...

00:16:06.866 --> 00:16:08.335
Who are you?

00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:11.141
We are known as Shadow Garden.

00:16:11.241 --> 00:16:14.516
It is our mission in life to
annihilate the Cult of Diablos.

00:16:14.616 --> 00:16:17.187
We already know everything
about your cult.

00:16:17.287 --> 00:16:19.525
And about the revival of
the Demon Diablos,

00:16:19.625 --> 00:16:21.061
the hero's descendants.

00:16:21.161 --> 00:16:24.034
Don't forget, the truth of
demon possession.

00:16:24.134 --> 00:16:26.038
Did you say the
Cult of Diablos?!

00:16:26.138 --> 00:16:28.309
How'd you find out?
Where'd you hear that name?!

00:16:28.409 --> 00:16:30.112
How'd you find that secret?!

00:16:30.212 --> 00:16:32.584
(swords clashing)
(epic music)

00:16:39.397 --> 00:16:41.468
(Grease grunts)
(blood splatters)

00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:43.540
I'm not going to kill you.

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:47.079
Not before you tell us
absolutely everything you know.

00:16:47.815 --> 00:16:49.317
(Grease grunts in pain)

00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:54.127
(crunch)

00:16:54.227 --> 00:16:56.064
(Grease yelling)
(loud thundering)

00:16:56.165 --> 00:16:58.503
(pounding music)

00:17:00.674 --> 00:17:01.809
Blugh!

00:17:03.212 --> 00:17:05.550
(swords clash)

00:17:06.485 --> 00:17:08.724
That was an interesting trick.

00:17:08.824 --> 00:17:10.492
Heh...

00:17:10.594 --> 00:17:12.464
(Grease yelling)

00:17:12.565 --> 00:17:14.702
(rocks crumbling)

00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:23.419
I'll go after him.

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:25.223
No need to.

00:17:25.323 --> 00:17:27.293
[Alpha]
He's headed straight for HIM.

00:17:27.393 --> 00:17:30.300
(gasps)
Is that the reason we split up?

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:32.704
Lord Shadow is so brilliant!

00:17:35.745 --> 00:17:37.179
Well, I'm lost.

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:39.786
I guess I got a little carried
away hunting the little guy.

00:17:39.886 --> 00:17:42.256
Huh?
(stone rumbling)

00:17:45.664 --> 00:17:47.801
(panting) Dammit!

00:17:48.636 --> 00:17:49.605
Hmm?

00:17:49.705 --> 00:17:50.641
How the hell did you know

00:17:50.741 --> 00:17:51.843
I was coming this way?

00:17:51.943 --> 00:17:54.114
Hold on a sec,
there's only one of you.

00:17:54.214 --> 00:17:56.585
(Grease yelling)
(loud thundering)

00:17:57.855 --> 00:18:00.192
(swords ringing)

00:18:01.896 --> 00:18:03.567
(loud thundering)

00:18:03.667 --> 00:18:06.037
You may have more magic power
than Alpha,

00:18:06.137 --> 00:18:09.712
unfortunately, you have no idea
how to use that power, do you?

00:18:09.812 --> 00:18:10.881
And I'm sorry to say,

00:18:10.981 --> 00:18:12.985
but your lunge is
quite pathetic.

00:18:13.085 --> 00:18:15.423
(swords clanging)

00:18:15.524 --> 00:18:16.893
Can't you see that
your fighting

00:18:16.993 --> 00:18:19.566
has absolutely no finesse?

00:18:19.666 --> 00:18:21.703
Please, allow me to
give you a masterclass

00:18:21.803 --> 00:18:23.740
on the correct use of magic.

00:18:24.441 --> 00:18:27.380
(Grease grunts in anger)

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:30.588
Lesson One: Concentrate a little
magical energy in your feet

00:18:30.688 --> 00:18:32.490
for a burst of speed.

00:18:33.025 --> 00:18:34.194
(Grease yelling)

00:18:34.294 --> 00:18:36.365
Lesson Two:
With the proper distance,

00:18:36.465 --> 00:18:38.503
you don't need speed
AND strength.

00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:40.874
You don't even need magic.

00:18:42.845 --> 00:18:43.947
Lesson Three:

00:18:44.047 --> 00:18:45.884
I'm just getting started.

00:18:45.984 --> 00:18:48.355
(sword slicing)
(Grease groaning)

00:18:53.967 --> 00:18:57.474
[Grease] <i>Have I ever felt so
overwhelmed in battle before?</i>

00:18:57.575 --> 00:18:59.278
<i>If I have, it was as a boy</i>

00:18:59.378 --> 00:19:01.616
<i>when I was sparring
against my teacher</i>

00:19:01.716 --> 00:19:04.722
<i>after I had only just
taken up the sword.</i>

00:19:05.691 --> 00:19:08.295
<i>But...</i>

00:19:08.395 --> 00:19:12.537
I don't care how much stronger
and more powerful you are.

00:19:12.638 --> 00:19:15.443
The darkness of this
disgusting world

00:19:15.544 --> 00:19:19.384
is so much deeper than
even you can imagine!

00:19:23.593 --> 00:19:24.829
(chuckles)

00:19:24.929 --> 00:19:26.332
(Grease gasps)

00:19:26.432 --> 00:19:28.368
Then I'll dive even deeper.

00:19:28.468 --> 00:19:30.072
As deep as I can go.

00:19:30.172 --> 00:19:32.076
(driving electronic music)

00:19:32.176 --> 00:19:33.546
[Grease] I'm serious, boy.

00:19:33.646 --> 00:19:36.217
(Grease yells)
(glass shatters)

00:19:38.289 --> 00:19:40.126
[Grease]
I'll teach you something

00:19:40.226 --> 00:19:42.898
about the darkness
of this world!

00:19:44.001 --> 00:19:46.371
(guttural yell)

00:19:46.471 --> 00:19:49.177
We're all worthless,
and fragile!

00:19:49.278 --> 00:19:50.948
That is reality!

00:19:51.048 --> 00:19:52.317
Taste it for yourself!

00:19:52.417 --> 00:19:54.721
Feel your own powerlessness!

00:19:57.895 --> 00:19:59.297
How disgraceful.

00:19:59.397 --> 00:20:01.769
(sword zapping)
(dramatic music)

00:20:05.143 --> 00:20:07.046
[Grease] What is this?

00:20:07.146 --> 00:20:09.384
This enormous magical energy?

00:20:09.484 --> 00:20:11.689
Sorry, play time's over.

00:20:13.058 --> 00:20:15.395
(sword thundering)

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:19.671
(Grease groaning)
(blood splattering)

00:20:22.077 --> 00:20:23.613
[Grease] <i>Of course...</i>

00:20:24.414 --> 00:20:27.220
<i>It's not just his technique.</i>

00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:28.990
<i>It's everything.</i>

00:20:30.259 --> 00:20:34.434
<i>I was powerless
against the darkness.</i>

00:20:34.535 --> 00:20:39.678
<i>But... maybe... this boy...</i>

00:20:39.778 --> 00:20:41.615
(death rattle)

00:20:42.216 --> 00:20:43.719
Milia...

00:21:05.664 --> 00:21:08.603
[Shadow] He was pretty tough
for a regular old bandit.

00:21:10.707 --> 00:21:12.277
[Kagenou] <i>Well,
that's pretty much how we</i>

00:21:12.377 --> 00:21:15.415
<i>successfully pulled off
this rescue mission.</i>

00:21:15.517 --> 00:21:17.119
<i>After breaking out
of her chains,</i>

00:21:17.219 --> 00:21:21.194
<i>Claire showed up back home the
next day in a very bad mood.</i>

00:21:21.294 --> 00:21:22.965
<i>She is stubbornly tenacious.</i>

00:21:23.065 --> 00:21:25.804
<i>And her injuries were more or
less healed overnight.</i>

00:21:25.904 --> 00:21:27.406
<i>She set out for
the Royal Capitol</i>

00:21:27.508 --> 00:21:29.611
<i>as if nothing had
ever happened.</i>

00:21:30.146 --> 00:21:32.483
(soft music)

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:42.571
[Kagenou] <i>I wish I could
go to the Capitol.</i>

00:21:42.671 --> 00:21:44.875
<i>It's a giant metropolis
that doesn't even compare</i>

00:21:44.975 --> 00:21:46.178
<i>to this hick town.</i>

00:21:46.278 --> 00:21:47.514
<i>There's bound to be
a character there</i>

00:21:47.614 --> 00:21:49.417
<i>in the position of
main protagonist.</i>

00:21:49.518 --> 00:21:52.223
<i>And I bet there's
a last boss too.</i>

00:21:52.323 --> 00:21:54.594
<i>Well, I'll get to
go there in two years.</i>

00:21:54.695 --> 00:21:57.834
<i>In the meantime, I'll put Alpha
and the girls to work.</i>

00:21:57.934 --> 00:21:59.070
Shadow...

00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:00.974
(chuckles)

00:22:02.076 --> 00:22:03.245
[Alpha] The hour has come.

00:22:03.345 --> 00:22:05.049
It is time for us to part ways.

00:22:05.149 --> 00:22:06.819
We must leave you now.

00:22:11.161 --> 00:22:12.697
<i>What?</i>

00:22:13.967 --> 00:22:15.603
This is goodbye.

00:22:17.875 --> 00:22:19.377
Goodbye?

00:22:21.047 --> 00:22:23.385
(ENDING THEME)
