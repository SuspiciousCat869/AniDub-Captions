WEBVTT

00:00:01.738 --> 00:00:04.042
(water bubbling)

00:00:04.142 --> 00:00:06.513
(evil laughter)
(dramatic music)

00:00:06.613 --> 00:00:08.449
(glass cracks)

00:00:11.056 --> 00:00:13.393
(glass shattering)

00:00:15.732 --> 00:00:16.800
(clang)

00:00:16.901 --> 00:00:18.605
It's all white!

00:00:18.705 --> 00:00:21.309
What the hell is happening?

00:00:21.409 --> 00:00:24.749
I don't see Epsilon
or the others.

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:26.687
[Epsilon] We've been separated.

00:00:26.787 --> 00:00:27.989
This must be another feature

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:29.826
of the Sanctuary's
security system.

00:00:29.927 --> 00:00:32.264
(dramatic music)

00:00:33.535 --> 00:00:34.569
(Nelson laughs)

00:00:34.669 --> 00:00:38.110
Don't you see?
The Sanctuary is OUR territory!

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.115
You will rue the day you
turned against the Cult.

00:00:41.215 --> 00:00:44.154
Now feel our wrath!

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:47.896
(raaah)

00:00:47.996 --> 00:00:50.333
(blood splattering)

00:00:50.702 --> 00:00:52.037
(laughs)

00:00:52.137 --> 00:00:53.641
(gasps)

00:00:54.442 --> 00:00:56.179
(hyah)

00:00:56.279 --> 00:00:58.617
(blood splattering)

00:01:01.691 --> 00:01:03.192
(hyah)

00:01:05.164 --> 00:01:06.667
Hmm...

00:01:11.142 --> 00:01:13.480
Something doesn't feel right.

00:01:13.581 --> 00:01:14.816
[Alpha] I see.

00:01:14.917 --> 00:01:17.387
[Nelson] The closer you get to
the center of the Sanctuary,

00:01:17.488 --> 00:01:19.425
the more your power
will drain away.

00:01:19.526 --> 00:01:21.295
You didn't realize
that I was luring you

00:01:21.395 --> 00:01:23.534
right where I wanted you,
did you?

00:01:23.634 --> 00:01:25.972
[Alpha] Meanwhile, the closer
YOU get to the center,

00:01:26.072 --> 00:01:27.375
the more power you gain.

00:01:27.475 --> 00:01:30.548
[Nelson] (laughs)
I was hoping that we would be

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:33.353
a little closer before
I got started.

00:01:33.453 --> 00:01:37.227
However, this should be more
than close enough I think.

00:01:37.862 --> 00:01:39.866
[Delta] All this prey...

00:01:39.966 --> 00:01:42.839
One and two...

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:45.143
Lots and lots!

00:01:45.244 --> 00:01:47.582
(OPENING THEME)

00:03:20.333 --> 00:03:22.638
(footsteps echoing)

00:03:29.853 --> 00:03:31.355
Question...

00:03:31.857 --> 00:03:33.359
Hmm?

00:03:34.128 --> 00:03:36.132
[Aurora] What are you doing?

00:03:36.232 --> 00:03:37.869
[Cid] Oh, just noticing
that this place

00:03:37.969 --> 00:03:40.274
has no sense of up or down.

00:03:40.374 --> 00:03:42.712
Then I suggest
you just don't...

00:03:42.813 --> 00:03:44.282
look up or down?

00:03:44.382 --> 00:03:46.252
[Cid] I wasn't going to.

00:03:48.223 --> 00:03:50.561
(light blasting)

00:03:53.835 --> 00:03:54.869
Whoa!

00:03:54.969 --> 00:03:56.807
Ooh!

00:03:56.907 --> 00:03:58.209
You're heavy.

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:59.780
You're imagining it.

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:00.882
(Cid groans)

00:04:00.982 --> 00:04:03.119
[Aurora] That's what you get
for goofing off.

00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:04.790
Honestly!

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.729
[Kagenou] <i>A battlefield
devoid of all hope.</i>

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:09.365
<i>And, unknown to all,</i>

00:04:09.465 --> 00:04:12.037
<i>an Eminence intervenes
from the shadows.</i>

00:04:12.138 --> 00:04:13.607
<i>That'll work.</i>

00:04:13.707 --> 00:04:15.845
(eerie music)

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.489
[Aurora] Let's go.

00:04:24.061 --> 00:04:26.398
(footsteps thudding)

00:04:31.142 --> 00:04:32.645
Hmm?

00:04:35.584 --> 00:04:37.187
[Cid] You're crying again.

00:04:37.287 --> 00:04:39.325
[Aurora] I was a crybaby.

00:04:39.425 --> 00:04:40.961
Hand me your sword.

00:04:43.366 --> 00:04:45.270
(eerie music continues)

00:04:45.371 --> 00:04:47.708
(metal scraping)

00:05:03.541 --> 00:05:05.945
(zombies growling)

00:05:06.045 --> 00:05:07.380
(gasps)

00:05:08.483 --> 00:05:10.353
What are you...

00:05:10.454 --> 00:05:12.324
(zombie growls)

00:05:16.332 --> 00:05:18.003
This is frustrating.

00:05:18.103 --> 00:05:20.508
The Sanctuary is rejecting us.
(zombies growling)

00:05:20.608 --> 00:05:22.044
[Cid]
I guess it's like we're a virus,

00:05:22.144 --> 00:05:24.650
and we're getting caught
by the antivirus software.

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:26.553
I don't understand
that analogy.

00:05:26.653 --> 00:05:28.624
I don't know much
about it myself.

00:05:28.724 --> 00:05:31.462
By the way, what happens
to you if you die here?

00:05:31.563 --> 00:05:33.867
I'll probably be sent back
to that first room.

00:05:33.968 --> 00:05:36.405
Wow,
that sounds slightly obnoxious.

00:05:36.506 --> 00:05:38.009
Yes, it does.

00:05:38.109 --> 00:05:40.146
It's really is quite tiresome.

00:05:40.246 --> 00:05:42.017
[Cid] Yeah, I agree.

00:05:42.885 --> 00:05:45.023
[footsteps echoing]

00:05:53.106 --> 00:05:54.642
[Chi] Huh?
[Omega] Mmm?

00:05:55.244 --> 00:05:57.582
(zombie moaning)

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:06.866
(zombie moaning)

00:06:11.877 --> 00:06:13.346
Ah...

00:06:13.446 --> 00:06:15.116
Lady Epsilon?

00:06:16.319 --> 00:06:18.022
Don't worry.

00:06:18.123 --> 00:06:20.460
(zombie moaning)

00:06:23.467 --> 00:06:25.804
(light flashing)

00:06:27.575 --> 00:06:28.910
[both] Ah...

00:06:30.013 --> 00:06:32.150
(zombie laughs)

00:06:33.854 --> 00:06:35.190
[Chi] What?

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:36.961
[Omega] What happened?

00:06:37.061 --> 00:06:38.497
[Epsilon]
It's probably something similar

00:06:38.598 --> 00:06:40.501
to the Goddess' Trial.

00:06:40.601 --> 00:06:44.475
Like a memory that reacted to
us and then materialized.

00:06:44.576 --> 00:06:46.445
Reacted to us?

00:06:47.549 --> 00:06:49.285
[Epsilon] Yes, to us.

00:06:49.385 --> 00:06:50.988
The ones who are possessed.

00:06:51.088 --> 00:06:52.224
(all gasp)

00:06:52.324 --> 00:06:54.662
(glass shattering)

00:06:55.631 --> 00:06:58.436
(eerie music)

00:06:58.537 --> 00:07:00.641
(glass shattering)

00:07:02.912 --> 00:07:07.622
You know,
this would be us if we had
never met Lord Shadow, crazy.

00:07:07.722 --> 00:07:09.692
There's a lot more here
than I would have guessed.

00:07:09.792 --> 00:07:11.229
Indeed, but we got lucky.

00:07:11.329 --> 00:07:13.300
[Chi] With all this, we won't
have to keep coming back

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:14.636
for more information.

00:07:14.736 --> 00:07:16.607
True,
but it's all just memories.

00:07:16.707 --> 00:07:19.278
It will not be easy to
take it back with us.

00:07:19.378 --> 00:07:20.882
[Epsilon]
I assume you brought cameras?

00:07:20.982 --> 00:07:25.423
[Chi] Yes, the newest product
from Mitsugoshi, the Rolapoid.

00:07:25.524 --> 00:07:28.329
This is incredible,
the images have perfect color.

00:07:28.429 --> 00:07:30.535
Agreed, Lady Eta is a genius.

00:07:30.635 --> 00:07:33.607
Yes, we owe it all to the
wisdom of Lord Shadow.

00:07:33.707 --> 00:07:35.577
[Shadow girl] (squeals)

00:07:36.011 --> 00:07:37.047
Not again!

00:07:37.147 --> 00:07:39.484
This is exactly what happened
at the Academy!

00:07:39.585 --> 00:07:42.558
This will NOT make things easy.

00:07:42.658 --> 00:07:44.261
I would suppose this means that

00:07:44.361 --> 00:07:45.631
the closer we get
to the center,

00:07:45.731 --> 00:07:48.036
the more it absorbs our magic.

00:07:48.136 --> 00:07:51.241
We'll need to be careful
how we manage our magic.

00:07:51.341 --> 00:07:52.344
[all] Hmm?

00:07:52.444 --> 00:07:54.816
(balls wobbling)
(dramatic music)

00:07:59.893 --> 00:08:02.030
(squelching)

00:08:09.613 --> 00:08:11.683
(casually)
Did something just happen?

00:08:13.587 --> 00:08:16.058
[Epsilon] (deliberately)
Did something just happen?

00:08:16.158 --> 00:08:17.060
[Chi] No.

00:08:17.161 --> 00:08:19.498
[Omega] Nothing.

00:08:19.599 --> 00:08:21.936
(sword fighting)
(dramatic music)

00:08:24.943 --> 00:08:27.447
[Cid]
You're not the best fighter
without your magic, are you?

00:08:27.548 --> 00:08:28.851
[Aurora] I told you, remember?

00:08:28.951 --> 00:08:31.022
I'm a delicate damsel
in distress.

00:08:31.122 --> 00:08:34.228
You seem to be doing fine
without your magic, though.

00:08:34.328 --> 00:08:35.497
Ever since I was a kid,

00:08:35.598 --> 00:08:37.935
I've spent a lot of my time
bodybuilding.

00:08:38.036 --> 00:08:39.606
(zombie groans)

00:08:39.706 --> 00:08:42.177
You're destroying them.
Like a gorilla.

00:08:42.277 --> 00:08:45.316
Yeah, specifically, like a
man-slinging gorilla.

00:08:45.416 --> 00:08:48.523
Don't suppose you have any
cooler-sounding metaphors.

00:08:48.623 --> 00:08:50.661
[Aurora] If there was a
tournament for gorill-

00:08:50.761 --> 00:08:54.401
For humans who can't use magic,
you would win.

00:08:54.503 --> 00:08:56.640
[Cid]
Well, that's a little better.

00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:59.078
I don't hate this god-mode
thing we got going.

00:08:59.178 --> 00:09:02.384
But with no magic,
this could go on forever.

00:09:02.484 --> 00:09:04.154
That would be a problem.

00:09:04.254 --> 00:09:06.593
(somber music)

00:09:21.456 --> 00:09:22.525
[Cid] I'm sorry.

00:09:22.625 --> 00:09:25.329
(glass shattering)

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:27.735
(dramatic music)

00:09:32.111 --> 00:09:33.179
[Cid] You okay?

00:09:33.279 --> 00:09:35.049
[Aurora] Yes, thank you.

00:09:35.149 --> 00:09:36.953
This place is huge.

00:09:39.124 --> 00:09:40.427
[Cid] So is that...

00:09:40.528 --> 00:09:44.134
[Aurora] Yes,
the center of the Sanctuary.

00:09:51.683 --> 00:09:54.020
(blood splattering)

00:09:55.089 --> 00:09:57.294
(raaah)

00:09:57.394 --> 00:09:58.597
That's impossible!

00:09:58.697 --> 00:09:59.932
(blood splattering)

00:10:00.032 --> 00:10:03.005
[Nelson] Your magic is
supposed to be limited!

00:10:03.105 --> 00:10:06.478
How can you still
put up a fight?
(Delta laughing)

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:08.950
(blood splattering)
(dramatic music)

00:10:10.353 --> 00:10:12.691
(more blood)

00:10:20.273 --> 00:10:21.943
Better.

00:10:23.312 --> 00:10:24.415
This can't be.

00:10:24.516 --> 00:10:26.318
Did you really awaken
all on your own?

00:10:26.418 --> 00:10:27.555
But that's not possible.

00:10:27.655 --> 00:10:29.191
The technique for that
was lost ages ago!

00:10:29.291 --> 00:10:30.193
(blood splattering)

00:10:30.293 --> 00:10:31.362
[Alpha] Was it really?

00:10:31.462 --> 00:10:32.632
Huh?!

00:10:32.732 --> 00:10:34.268
(laughs)

00:10:34.368 --> 00:10:35.637
(Nelson moans)

00:10:35.737 --> 00:10:36.940
[Nelson] That's all right!

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:39.579
I was prepared for this
level of resistance!

00:10:39.679 --> 00:10:43.753
Behold! This is my full power!

00:10:44.856 --> 00:10:47.193
[Delta] (raah)

00:10:49.464 --> 00:10:51.803
(raaah)

00:10:53.072 --> 00:10:54.141
Iron Slab...

00:10:54.241 --> 00:10:56.378
(Delta screaming)

00:11:03.326 --> 00:11:04.763
(gulp)

00:11:04.863 --> 00:11:07.200
(explosion)

00:11:09.772 --> 00:11:12.411
[Cid] So what are we
supposed to destroy again?

00:11:12.512 --> 00:11:13.947
[Aurora] The magic core.

00:11:14.047 --> 00:11:16.986
It should be on the
other side of that door.

00:11:17.086 --> 00:11:19.491
Think breaking the chains
will get us through?

00:11:19.592 --> 00:11:21.261
It probably will.

00:11:22.063 --> 00:11:23.365
(chink)

00:11:24.836 --> 00:11:26.873
Well,
I can't do it with this sword.

00:11:26.973 --> 00:11:29.679
Any way that I slice it, the
sword is gonna break first.

00:11:29.779 --> 00:11:31.081
Excuse me.

00:11:31.181 --> 00:11:33.286
Doesn't it occur to you that
there might be a key?

00:11:33.386 --> 00:11:35.991
I guess that could help.
That's a good point.

00:11:36.091 --> 00:11:37.962
[Cid] So is that it?
[Aurora] Uh, yeah.

00:11:38.062 --> 00:11:39.832
[Aurora] It's written right
there on the sword that,

00:11:39.932 --> 00:11:42.136
"This sword can cut the chains."

00:11:43.707 --> 00:11:44.776
Huh...

00:11:44.876 --> 00:11:47.549
(sword hums)

00:11:47.649 --> 00:11:49.251
I'm getting a feeling.

00:11:49.351 --> 00:11:50.253
Huh?

00:11:50.353 --> 00:11:51.690
I cannot draw this sword.

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:53.292
(gasps)

00:11:58.402 --> 00:12:00.908
(strains) Yup, I knew it.

00:12:01.008 --> 00:12:03.278
The sword is rejecting me.

00:12:03.379 --> 00:12:04.649
(alarm beeping)

00:12:04.749 --> 00:12:07.855
This sword can only be drawn
by the chosen one.

00:12:07.955 --> 00:12:09.892
Wait look at this!

00:12:11.229 --> 00:12:15.036
"The holy sword can only be
drawn by direct descendants."

00:12:15.137 --> 00:12:16.906
You're right,
it says so right here!

00:12:17.006 --> 00:12:18.175
I'm impressed
that you deciphered

00:12:18.275 --> 00:12:19.780
the encrypted
magical inscription

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:21.916
with a single glance.

00:12:22.016 --> 00:12:23.219
[Cid] (dry chuckle)

00:12:23.319 --> 00:12:25.657
I'm well versed in all
the standard formulas.

00:12:25.757 --> 00:12:27.795
So you've formulized
all of the countless

00:12:27.895 --> 00:12:31.369
magical script encryption
patterns and memorized them.

00:12:31.469 --> 00:12:32.906
Is that what you mean?

00:12:33.006 --> 00:12:35.678
I'm pretty sure that's
exactly what I mean.

00:12:35.778 --> 00:12:37.715
[Aurora] So now what do we do?

00:12:37.815 --> 00:12:39.652
[Cid] Are there
any other ways through?

00:12:39.752 --> 00:12:41.421
[Aurora] Not written here.

00:12:44.161 --> 00:12:45.463
I see.

00:12:51.943 --> 00:12:54.314
(Delta screaming)
(blood splattering)

00:12:55.818 --> 00:12:58.122
(Delta screaming)
(blood splattering)

00:12:58.223 --> 00:13:00.226
You know,
I'm not so sure I believe

00:13:00.326 --> 00:13:02.397
she's really working
with Shadow.

00:13:02.497 --> 00:13:04.201
What would make you say
something like that?

00:13:04.301 --> 00:13:07.074
Her fighting style is totally
different from his.

00:13:07.174 --> 00:13:09.011
When I saw Shadow, he fenced

00:13:09.111 --> 00:13:11.215
using extremely
sophisticated techniques.

00:13:11.315 --> 00:13:13.987
But that? There's no technique,
no anything.

00:13:14.088 --> 00:13:16.726
It's just pure,
unbridled violence.

00:13:16.826 --> 00:13:18.029
I can tell she's strong,

00:13:18.129 --> 00:13:20.266
but I mean should that
even be allowed?

00:13:20.366 --> 00:13:24.307
Maybe she's just a muscle head,
all brawn no brain.

00:13:24.408 --> 00:13:26.913
(splat)
(ungh)

00:13:27.013 --> 00:13:28.917
(glass cracks)

00:13:29.018 --> 00:13:31.355
(glass crashing)

00:13:32.558 --> 00:13:33.761
[Nelson] How?!

00:13:33.861 --> 00:13:35.698
How could you defeat
over a hundred clones

00:13:35.798 --> 00:13:38.169
without even breaking a sweat?

00:13:38.269 --> 00:13:40.641
[Alpha] I assume you
were once a scientist?

00:13:40.741 --> 00:13:41.876
Huh?

00:13:41.976 --> 00:13:43.179
[Alpha] Make as many
copies as you like,

00:13:43.279 --> 00:13:45.149
but they still
only have one brain.

00:13:45.249 --> 00:13:48.089
Not nearly sufficient to
control all those bodies.

00:13:48.189 --> 00:13:49.960
Even if there are
one hundred of them,

00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:51.228
unless they can move freely,

00:13:51.328 --> 00:13:53.633
they are no better
than scarecrows.

00:13:54.334 --> 00:13:55.604
(fearful)

00:13:56.338 --> 00:13:57.841
(growls)

00:13:59.779 --> 00:14:01.448
Olivier?

00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:04.689
Of course, Olivier!

00:14:04.789 --> 00:14:07.427
Olivier! Come forth!

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:11.468
Come forth! Come forth!

00:14:11.569 --> 00:14:14.407
Olivier!

00:14:15.343 --> 00:14:17.480
(dramatic music)

00:14:28.402 --> 00:14:30.507
The Hero Olivier...

00:14:35.183 --> 00:14:36.318
Oh...

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:39.257
(chuckling)

00:14:42.363 --> 00:14:45.436
Olivier, then you really are...

00:14:45.537 --> 00:14:46.606
(Delta growls)

00:14:46.706 --> 00:14:49.946
[Epsilon] Lady Alpha,
the investigation is over!

00:14:50.046 --> 00:14:52.417
We can exit any time.

00:14:52.518 --> 00:14:53.720
[Alpha] Well done.

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:56.592
Well then, the time has come
for us to excuse ourselves.

00:14:56.692 --> 00:14:58.329
Huh?

00:14:58.429 --> 00:15:01.301
[Nelson]
W-wait! You're leaving?

00:15:01.401 --> 00:15:04.975
Huh?
You're just going to run away?

00:15:05.075 --> 00:15:07.080
[Alpha] We have no interest
in grunts like you

00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:08.516
or in uncertain memories.

00:15:08.616 --> 00:15:11.923
Our only objective is to cut
off the source of power.

00:15:13.259 --> 00:15:16.399
And now we know how
the Sanctuary's defenses work.

00:15:16.499 --> 00:15:17.601
We'll visit you again.

00:15:17.701 --> 00:15:20.206
Next time, it will be at the
time of our choosing.

00:15:20.306 --> 00:15:21.642
You! You think I'll just...

00:15:21.742 --> 00:15:25.416
I'll just sit back and let you
just walk out of here?

00:15:25.517 --> 00:15:26.753
[Alpha] Oh?

00:15:26.853 --> 00:15:29.057
Will you be coming after us?

00:15:29.157 --> 00:15:31.495
(Nelson whimpers)

00:15:32.064 --> 00:15:33.132
(Delta growling)

00:15:33.232 --> 00:15:35.403
Delta, we're leaving.

00:15:35.504 --> 00:15:37.207
(growling)

00:15:37.307 --> 00:15:38.376
(sighs)

00:15:38.476 --> 00:15:39.311
Delta!

00:15:39.411 --> 00:15:42.016
Yes!
I'm sorry, Your Ladyship, sir!

00:15:42.117 --> 00:15:44.087
(dramatic music)

00:15:44.188 --> 00:15:46.258
[Alpha]
If you'd like to join us...

00:15:47.026 --> 00:15:48.229
[both] (uh...)

00:15:48.329 --> 00:15:51.234
I believe I would
like to go with you.

00:15:51.334 --> 00:15:53.506
Why don't you stay here,
Princess Alexia?

00:15:53.606 --> 00:15:56.846
Dark and gloomy places like
this suit you ever so well.

00:15:56.946 --> 00:15:58.049
[Chi] (umpfh)

00:15:58.149 --> 00:15:59.986
What? Why should I
have to stay behind

00:16:00.086 --> 00:16:01.556
in that evil baldy's hideout?

00:16:01.656 --> 00:16:03.860
I'm not staying here any
longer.
(Rose sighs)

00:16:03.961 --> 00:16:05.630
[Nelson] (uh...)

00:16:10.941 --> 00:16:12.444
[Nelson] Well... Well, fine.

00:16:12.545 --> 00:16:14.882
I got a good look at
that Alpha's face.

00:16:14.982 --> 00:16:16.285
If we can get her blood,

00:16:16.385 --> 00:16:18.623
we'll be that much closer to
perfecting the Beads.

00:16:18.723 --> 00:16:21.128
As for what I'll tell
the other factions...

00:16:21.228 --> 00:16:22.631
Well, let's see...

00:16:22.731 --> 00:16:25.136
I can just tell them that I
lured them to the Sanctuary,

00:16:25.236 --> 00:16:28.008
caught them in my trap,
and exposed their true
identities.

00:16:28.108 --> 00:16:30.814
Then I might actually be
rewarded for my- Huh?

00:16:30.914 --> 00:16:34.522
So some rats have wandered into
the Sanctuary's center.

00:16:34.622 --> 00:16:37.427
Ha! I can let off
some steam by toying-

00:16:37.528 --> 00:16:39.666
(drumbeat) Oh!

00:16:39.766 --> 00:16:41.335
Olivier, come with me!

00:16:41.435 --> 00:16:44.274
For crying out loud,
why does all the trouble
have to come along

00:16:44.374 --> 00:16:46.779
when I'm the one who
has to deal with it?

00:16:50.419 --> 00:16:52.891
[Cid] So, you wanna disappear?

00:16:52.991 --> 00:16:54.494
[Aurora] Disappear?

00:16:54.596 --> 00:16:56.498
[Cid] You said when we destroy
the core, you'll disappear.

00:16:56.599 --> 00:16:59.371
[Aurora] Oh, right.
But I won't really disappear.

00:16:59.471 --> 00:17:02.310
It would be more accurate to
say I'll be set free.

00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:04.081
This is a prison of memories

00:17:04.181 --> 00:17:06.786
that will repeat itself
into eternity.

00:17:06.886 --> 00:17:09.658
It's just a little
too much for me.

00:17:09.758 --> 00:17:13.566
Okay, then whattya say we
wait a little bit longer.

00:17:13.666 --> 00:17:14.502
[Aurora] Wait?

00:17:14.602 --> 00:17:16.205
[Cid]
Give it a little more time,

00:17:16.305 --> 00:17:17.775
for things to work out.

00:17:17.875 --> 00:17:19.779
Ah...

00:17:19.879 --> 00:17:21.182
<i>According to the formula,</i>

00:17:21.282 --> 00:17:23.085
<i>it is about time for the
story's protagonist</i>

00:17:23.185 --> 00:17:25.089
<i>to make an entrance,
after all.</i>

00:17:25.389 --> 00:17:26.092
Huh?

00:17:26.192 --> 00:17:28.563
(electrical discharge)

00:17:28.663 --> 00:17:30.601
[Kagenou]
<i>There you are, protagonist!</i>

00:17:30.701 --> 00:17:34.609
<i>The hero's direct descendant
who can draw the holy sword!</i>

00:17:34.709 --> 00:17:36.078
(shine)

00:17:36.178 --> 00:17:37.881
[Cid] And he's bald?!

00:17:37.981 --> 00:17:39.585
He's bald.

00:17:39.685 --> 00:17:41.523
Is this one of those times
where the bad guy

00:17:41.623 --> 00:17:44.294
gets there first to
stop the protagonist?

00:17:44.394 --> 00:17:47.434
[Kagenou] <i>What am I supposed
to do in this variation?</i>

00:17:47.535 --> 00:17:48.704
<i>Huh?</i>

00:17:48.804 --> 00:17:50.039
What's the matter?

00:17:50.139 --> 00:17:51.609
Oh, nothing is wrong exactly.

00:17:51.709 --> 00:17:55.216
It's just, that elf there looks
just like a friend of mine.

00:17:55.316 --> 00:17:57.722
But nah, it's not her.

00:17:57.822 --> 00:18:01.261
So, I see you've brought
Aurora out of her cage.

00:18:01.361 --> 00:18:02.931
You know this old baldy?

00:18:03.031 --> 00:18:04.903
Well, I'm not sure.

00:18:05.003 --> 00:18:06.338
I don't recognize him,

00:18:06.438 --> 00:18:09.343
but my memories are incomplete,
so I can't be sure.

00:18:09.444 --> 00:18:11.816
I may have met this
baldy somewhere.

00:18:11.917 --> 00:18:13.854
(Nelson laughs)

00:18:13.954 --> 00:18:15.389
Sorry to disappoint you,

00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:18.028
but the likes of you will never
be able to open that door!

00:18:18.129 --> 00:18:19.397
(dramatic music)

00:18:19.498 --> 00:18:21.903
[Nelson]
Bad luck for you, young man!

00:18:22.003 --> 00:18:23.105
You mean me?

00:18:23.205 --> 00:18:24.609
I don't know where you
wandered in from,

00:18:24.709 --> 00:18:27.146
but you were dumb enough to
let this witch deceive you

00:18:27.246 --> 00:18:28.684
and now you are going to die!

00:18:28.784 --> 00:18:31.856
Olivier here is going to
cut you to pieces!

00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:34.862
(gasps)

00:18:35.731 --> 00:18:36.799
(ah...)

00:18:36.899 --> 00:18:38.202
[Aurora] No, don't! She's-

00:18:38.302 --> 00:18:40.740
[Cid] I know, she's strong.

00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:41.943
[Aurora] You have to run!

00:18:42.043 --> 00:18:43.212
[Cid] Why?

00:18:43.312 --> 00:18:45.115
If you must blame someone,
don't blame me.

00:18:45.215 --> 00:18:47.286
Blame the witch for your
inevitable end!

00:18:47.387 --> 00:18:49.859
The witch,
or your own foolish self!

00:18:49.959 --> 00:18:50.861
(hmpfh)

00:18:50.961 --> 00:18:53.298
(tense dramatic music)

00:18:58.075 --> 00:18:59.746
(Olivier dashing)

00:18:59.846 --> 00:19:01.716
(Aurora gasps)
(explosion)

00:19:02.718 --> 00:19:04.855
(multiple explosions)

00:19:20.086 --> 00:19:21.322
(gasps)

00:19:21.422 --> 00:19:22.791
(music stops abruptly)

00:19:22.891 --> 00:19:23.894
(schwing)

00:19:23.994 --> 00:19:25.663
(thud)

00:19:29.538 --> 00:19:31.441
(chuckles)

00:19:31.542 --> 00:19:33.412
[Nelson]
Why are you making that face?

00:19:33.513 --> 00:19:36.284
Why on earth are you
smiling right now?

00:19:38.155 --> 00:19:41.663
Oh yeah, you're right.
I am smiling.

00:19:41.763 --> 00:19:43.633
There is nothing
I find more repugnant

00:19:43.733 --> 00:19:46.204
than a man who does
not know his place.

00:19:46.304 --> 00:19:48.275
The only reason you are
still alive right now

00:19:48.376 --> 00:19:50.847
is that you were lucky,
that's all!

00:19:51.816 --> 00:19:53.953
(Olivier whooshing)

00:19:56.793 --> 00:19:57.895
(swords clanging)

00:19:57.995 --> 00:20:00.332
(blood splattering)

00:20:08.148 --> 00:20:09.417
[Nelson] Impossible!

00:20:09.519 --> 00:20:11.890
How is it that you
are still alive?!

00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:15.062
[Cid] A battle without a
conversation is just tedious.

00:20:15.162 --> 00:20:16.599
[Nelson] What?

00:20:16.699 --> 00:20:18.637
She doesn't even have a heart.

00:20:18.737 --> 00:20:21.943
Not only that, she doesn't
answer any of my questions.

00:20:22.043 --> 00:20:23.947
What are you talking about?

00:20:24.047 --> 00:20:26.251
Olivier!
Finish him off already!

00:20:26.351 --> 00:20:28.556
[Aurora] No, stop it!
[Cid] Hmm?

00:20:28.656 --> 00:20:30.594
[Aurora] That's enough of this!
[Cid] But why?

00:20:30.694 --> 00:20:33.533
No human being could ever
overpower her!

00:20:33.633 --> 00:20:35.971
I don't remember why I know
that, but I do.

00:20:36.071 --> 00:20:38.408
Not even the guy who would win
in a tournament of humans

00:20:38.509 --> 00:20:40.647
who can't use magic?

00:20:40.747 --> 00:20:43.987
[Aurora] It's all right.
You've done enough.

00:20:44.087 --> 00:20:45.657
You've given me more memories

00:20:45.757 --> 00:20:48.630
than I ever
could have asked for.
[Cid] Huh?

00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:51.502
[Aurora] There's no need for
you to lose your life!
[Cid] Huh?

00:20:51.602 --> 00:20:54.240
-I'll figure out the rest
of it on my own.
-Huh?

00:20:54.341 --> 00:20:56.044
(Nelson laughs)

00:20:56.144 --> 00:20:58.049
[Nelson]
A witch that can't use magic?

00:20:58.149 --> 00:20:59.484
What could you possibly do?

00:20:59.585 --> 00:21:01.689
I can least help him escape!

00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:03.459
(Nelson laughs)

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:05.964
[Nelson] A witch who is
defending another person?

00:21:06.064 --> 00:21:09.337
Truly, I have never heard
anything more ridiculous.

00:21:09.437 --> 00:21:10.941
But if you agree to help ME,

00:21:11.041 --> 00:21:13.746
then I would be willing to
spare the boy's life.

00:21:13.846 --> 00:21:15.416
Help you with what?

00:21:15.517 --> 00:21:17.219
What are you talking about?

00:21:17.319 --> 00:21:20.125
[Nelson] Huh, you and your
incomplete memories.

00:21:20.225 --> 00:21:23.465
All you have to do is swear
that you will work with us.

00:21:23.566 --> 00:21:25.770
You see,
we are severely behind schedule,

00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:28.977
because of your constant
refusal to cooperate.

00:21:29.077 --> 00:21:30.814
[Aurora] (gasps) All right.

00:21:30.914 --> 00:21:33.720
[Cid] Hey! Don't I get
a say in any of this?

00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:36.324
Excuse me!
I'm doing this for your sake!

00:21:36.424 --> 00:21:37.761
[Cid] I don't need your help.

00:21:37.861 --> 00:21:39.464
I've been listening
to you guys talk,

00:21:39.565 --> 00:21:41.068
and I wish you'd
stop assuming that

00:21:41.168 --> 00:21:42.437
I'm gonna lose this battle.

00:21:42.538 --> 00:21:44.207
It's really quite offensive.

00:21:44.307 --> 00:21:45.577
Are you so stupid

00:21:45.677 --> 00:21:47.614
that you don't know
what's going on here?

00:21:47.715 --> 00:21:50.319
We're saying that if you're a
good boy and do what we say,

00:21:50.419 --> 00:21:51.789
we'll let you go!

00:21:51.889 --> 00:21:54.394
[Cid] And I'm saying,
I don't need your help.

00:21:54.494 --> 00:21:56.031
[Cid] You two can just watch.
[Aurora] Wait!

00:21:56.131 --> 00:21:58.769
Fine then! Kill him!

00:22:00.472 --> 00:22:02.811
(blood splattering)

00:22:13.231 --> 00:22:14.902
(chuckles)

00:22:16.539 --> 00:22:18.743
(echoing) I got you!

00:22:21.181 --> 00:22:23.519
(ENDING THEME)
