00:00:01.102 --> 00:00:03.406
(eerie music)

00:00:08.852 --> 00:00:11.222
(horse neighing)
(wheels clattering)

00:00:17.635 --> 00:00:19.773
(man gasping)

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:25.417
(gasping and whimpering)

00:00:26.053 --> 00:00:28.389
(dramatic music)

00:00:30.629 --> 00:00:33.100
We are Shadow Garden.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.437
Please, don't kill me!

00:00:36.808 --> 00:00:39.478
We are Shadow Garden.

00:00:40.681 --> 00:00:42.819
(blood splattering)

00:00:44.355 --> 00:00:46.693
We are Shadow Garden.

00:00:48.297 --> 00:00:50.801
We are Shadow Garden.

00:00:53.106 --> 00:00:55.443
We are Shadow Garden.

00:00:59.018 --> 00:01:01.355
(OPENING THEME)

00:02:32.238 --> 00:02:34.408
(light-hearted music)

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:37.949
So, tell me how it went
with Princess Alexia.

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:39.619
Hmm.

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:41.022
(slurping)

00:02:41.122 --> 00:02:42.291
There's nothing more to tell.

00:02:42.391 --> 00:02:43.527
We broke up and that was that.

00:02:43.627 --> 00:02:46.099
You didn't even
make out with her?

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:47.835
(both smooch)

00:02:48.838 --> 00:02:50.508
Nope, not once.

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:53.681
Ugh, what a waste.

00:02:53.781 --> 00:02:55.918
You are a lost cause.

00:02:56.018 --> 00:02:57.254
Fine, since you're such a wimp,

00:02:57.354 --> 00:02:59.391
I know a place of business
that can HELP you.

00:02:59.491 --> 00:03:01.797
A place of business?
What are you saying?

00:03:01.897 --> 00:03:03.133
Not that kind of place.

00:03:03.233 --> 00:03:04.536
I'm talking about Mitsugoshi,

00:03:04.636 --> 00:03:06.305
the one everyone's
talking about.

00:03:06.405 --> 00:03:08.911
They sell all kinds of stuff no
one's ever seen before.

00:03:09.012 --> 00:03:11.315
They have this thing called
chocolate. It's tasty as hell.

00:03:11.415 --> 00:03:14.556
Oh, I get it! You're saying we
use that to get girls to-

00:03:14.656 --> 00:03:16.192
[Skel] Cid!
[Po] Come on, Cid!

00:03:16.292 --> 00:03:18.831
[Skel] Let's go there!
[Po] Please, let's go, Cid!

00:03:19.198 --> 00:03:20.233
(slurp)

00:03:20.333 --> 00:03:22.572
If you really want,
then we'll go.

00:03:22.672 --> 00:03:23.741
[both] Yeah!

00:03:23.841 --> 00:03:25.110
(Skel and Po cheering)

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:26.580
<i>I mean, I am curious about</i>

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.652
<i>what this world calls
"chocolate."</i>

00:03:29.753 --> 00:03:31.890
(birds chirping)

00:03:33.092 --> 00:03:34.963
[Iris]
First, take a look at this.

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:39.773
[Sherry] Is that an artifact?

00:03:39.873 --> 00:03:43.112
It looks to me like it's in
fairly good condition.

00:03:43.212 --> 00:03:44.649
[Iris] After the
incident the other day,

00:03:44.749 --> 00:03:46.620
we confiscated it
from a facility

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.325
belonging to an organization
that calls themselves

00:03:49.425 --> 00:03:51.496
the Cult of Diablos.

00:03:51.597 --> 00:03:53.300
But we know nothing about it.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.838
So, Miss Sherry Barnett,

00:03:55.938 --> 00:03:58.343
as you are the most brilliant
mind in the kingdom,

00:03:58.443 --> 00:04:01.182
will you please decipher
this artifact for us?

00:04:01.282 --> 00:04:03.286
Huh?
But I'm still only a student.

00:04:03.386 --> 00:04:04.856
Are you sure you want me?

00:04:04.956 --> 00:04:08.496
[Iris] No other researcher in
this field is better than you.

00:04:08.597 --> 00:04:09.966
And rumors of your brilliance

00:04:10.066 --> 00:04:11.937
have spread
all over town, Sherry.

00:04:12.037 --> 00:04:13.339
[Sherry] Uh...

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:16.713
It's a good opportunity.
You should take it, dear.

00:04:16.814 --> 00:04:17.849
[Sherry] Father?

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:19.920
A day will come
when you will travel the world

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:21.455
with your research.

00:04:21.556 --> 00:04:23.159
Speaking as
assistant principal of

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:24.929
the Midgard Academy of Science,

00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:26.767
I think it's a good idea.

00:04:26.867 --> 00:04:27.569
But I...

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:29.639
Have faith in yourself.

00:04:30.875 --> 00:04:32.578
I believe in you.

00:04:35.451 --> 00:04:37.555
All right, yes!

00:04:38.423 --> 00:04:39.826
To be on the safe side,

00:04:39.926 --> 00:04:42.932
I will assign the Crimson Order
to keep watch over you.

00:04:43.032 --> 00:04:44.368
Crimson Order?

00:04:44.468 --> 00:04:45.671
Is that the
new order of knights

00:04:45.771 --> 00:04:47.408
you recently established, Iris?

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:49.078
They're a small order
as of yet,

00:04:49.178 --> 00:04:50.982
but they are knights
I can trust.

00:04:51.082 --> 00:04:52.852
You can count on us.

00:04:53.687 --> 00:04:56.794
Iris,
I want to be of service too.

00:04:56.894 --> 00:04:59.431
[Iris] Alexia, but...

00:04:59.532 --> 00:05:01.335
I have to know everything.

00:05:01.435 --> 00:05:02.839
What is it that they're after?

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:04.441
Who are they really?

00:05:07.247 --> 00:05:09.151
(Iris sighing)

00:05:09.252 --> 00:05:10.655
Very well then.

00:05:10.755 --> 00:05:12.692
But promise me
you'll stay out of danger.

00:05:12.792 --> 00:05:15.497
Thank you so much, Iris.
I won't let you down.

00:05:15.598 --> 00:05:17.100
(Sherry chuckles)

00:05:18.003 --> 00:05:19.606
(horse neighing)

00:05:19.706 --> 00:05:22.579
[Po]
Geez, these crowds are insane.

00:05:22.679 --> 00:05:26.553
Current wait time to get inside
to Mitsugoshi is 80 minutes.

00:05:26.653 --> 00:05:28.624
She said it's
going to be 80 minutes.

00:05:28.725 --> 00:05:30.995
So,
what do you think we should do?

00:05:31.095 --> 00:05:32.832
I think we can still make it
back to the dorms

00:05:32.932 --> 00:05:34.569
before curfew,

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:36.306
but there are all those
rumors about a killer

00:05:36.406 --> 00:05:38.844
going around after dark
butchering people.

00:05:38.944 --> 00:05:40.414
[Cid] Wait, did you say killer?
[Skel] What?

00:05:40.515 --> 00:05:41.784
Po, you're stupid.

00:05:41.884 --> 00:05:44.556
Besides, we have three Dark
Knights on our team.

00:05:44.656 --> 00:05:46.059
Oh yeah, good point.

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:49.098
So, about that killer...

00:05:49.198 --> 00:05:52.070
[Kagenou] <i>Fancy architecture
that's modern somehow...</i>

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:54.208
<i>It reminds me of my past life.</i>

00:05:54.308 --> 00:05:56.614
<i>Everyone in line
is in the upper class.</i>

00:05:56.714 --> 00:05:59.252
<i>I couldn't feel more
out of place if I tried.</i>

00:05:59.352 --> 00:06:00.788
[employee]
Hello, sir. Excuse me,

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:03.560
but may I have a
moment of your time?

00:06:03.661 --> 00:06:05.063
I was hoping you
would be interested

00:06:05.163 --> 00:06:06.465
in taking a survey for us.

00:06:06.567 --> 00:06:07.936
Did you mean me?

00:06:08.036 --> 00:06:10.541
[employee] Yes, we'd really
appreciate your feedback.

00:06:10.641 --> 00:06:12.011
I'll take a survey!

00:06:12.111 --> 00:06:13.614
I will too!

00:06:14.448 --> 00:06:16.653
[both] Eh?

00:06:16.753 --> 00:06:19.759
We only need one guest,
thank you.

00:06:19.859 --> 00:06:22.397
(people talking indistinctly)

00:06:28.309 --> 00:06:31.449
[Kagenou]
<i>It's just like a department
store from my old life.</i>

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:33.185
<i>Chocolate, coffee...</i>

00:06:33.285 --> 00:06:36.058
<i>I've never seen any of it
in this world before.</i>

00:06:36.158 --> 00:06:37.862
<i>What is the deal here?</i>

00:06:42.304 --> 00:06:44.642
[Cid] Hey, I thought
there was a survey.

00:06:46.713 --> 00:06:47.414
Huh?

00:06:47.515 --> 00:06:49.852
(tense music)

00:06:56.298 --> 00:06:58.637
(tense music swells)

00:07:06.954 --> 00:07:08.790
(door creaking)

00:07:09.526 --> 00:07:11.863
(tense music continues)

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:25.456
[Gamma]
We have long awaited your
arrival at our establishment.

00:07:28.196 --> 00:07:30.801
Gamma, so this is your store?

00:07:30.901 --> 00:07:31.737
Yes, sir.

00:07:31.837 --> 00:07:33.473
I took it upon myself
to recreate,

00:07:33.574 --> 00:07:35.076
in what meager way I could,

00:07:35.177 --> 00:07:38.482
part of the wisdom that you
have shared with me, my Lord.

00:07:39.018 --> 00:07:40.087
Oh sure, I get it.

00:07:40.187 --> 00:07:41.255
<i>Now that she mentions it,</i>

00:07:41.355 --> 00:07:42.525
<i>I think I did used to tell them</i>

00:07:42.625 --> 00:07:43.861
<i>random things from my old life</i>

00:07:43.961 --> 00:07:46.700
<i>that I called the
Wisdom of the Shadows.</i>

00:07:47.467 --> 00:07:49.104
Do you want power?

00:07:50.107 --> 00:07:51.643
[Kagenou]
<i>But it was just little things.</i>

00:07:51.743 --> 00:07:53.313
<i>Like for chocolate I'd say,</i>

00:07:53.413 --> 00:07:56.151
<i>"If you take bitter beans and
throw a ton of sugar at them,</i>

00:07:56.251 --> 00:07:58.590
<i>it's delicious once hardened."</i>

00:07:58.690 --> 00:07:59.893
<i>Is it our brains?</i>

00:07:59.993 --> 00:08:01.863
<i>Is it the difference
in our intellect?</i>

00:08:01.963 --> 00:08:05.002
[Gamma] It's so good to finally
see you again, my Lord.

00:08:06.105 --> 00:08:08.309
[Kagenou]
<i>But Gamma here is pretty smart.</i>

00:08:08.409 --> 00:08:11.449
<i>I would even say she's the
smartest of the Seven Shadows,</i>

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:13.119
<i>but...</i>

00:08:13.219 --> 00:08:15.792
(gasps)
(groans)

00:08:15.892 --> 00:08:18.330
<i>She has absolutely
no athletic ability.</i>

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:19.766
Ah...

00:08:21.704 --> 00:08:24.241
Please, sir,
come sit on your throne.

00:08:24.342 --> 00:08:26.613
[Cid]
You've got blood on your face.

00:08:28.449 --> 00:08:30.788
(classical music)

00:08:31.188 --> 00:08:32.858
(chuckles)

00:08:34.428 --> 00:08:36.332
(giggles)

00:08:36.432 --> 00:08:37.569
<i>Yes...</i>

00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:39.305
<i>Yes, I love it!</i>

00:08:39.405 --> 00:08:40.741
<i>I feel like a king.</i>

00:08:40.841 --> 00:08:43.379
<i>Like I've truly become the
Eminence in Shadow.</i>

00:08:43.479 --> 00:08:46.853
<i>How did Gamma manage to build
this expensive setup?</i>

00:08:48.256 --> 00:08:51.062
(electrical discharge)

00:08:51.162 --> 00:08:52.397
Your reward, take it.

00:08:52.498 --> 00:08:54.401
(energy chiming)

00:08:54.502 --> 00:08:56.305
(all sighing)

00:08:57.975 --> 00:08:59.277
(sighs)

00:09:02.351 --> 00:09:03.554
Uh...

00:09:03.654 --> 00:09:07.093
It reminds me of the
beautiful light of life

00:09:07.193 --> 00:09:11.335
that saved me from the pain
and despair I once suffered.

00:09:11.435 --> 00:09:13.607
I'm not worthy of this honor.

00:09:13.707 --> 00:09:16.179
I'll remember this day
for the rest of my life.

00:09:16.279 --> 00:09:18.583
Great, so would you say
this shop of yours

00:09:18.683 --> 00:09:20.253
is turning out a decent profit?

00:09:20.353 --> 00:09:23.359
Yes, we currently have
franchises in major cities

00:09:23.459 --> 00:09:24.862
in and outside of the kingdom.

00:09:24.963 --> 00:09:26.533
and we are using
a mail order system

00:09:26.633 --> 00:09:28.302
to expand to remote regions.

00:09:28.402 --> 00:09:29.906
And for the organization,

00:09:30.006 --> 00:09:33.179
we have approximately 1 billion
zen at our immediate disposal.

00:09:33.279 --> 00:09:34.281
[Cid] (astonished) A billion?!

00:09:34.381 --> 00:09:36.285
Uh!
Is that not enough, my Lord?

00:09:36.385 --> 00:09:37.822
No, ah...

00:09:37.922 --> 00:09:40.561
<i>She used my knowledge to
build all this without me</i>

00:09:40.661 --> 00:09:42.263
<i>and made a crap ton of...</i>

00:09:42.364 --> 00:09:43.567
<i>No, calm down.</i>

00:09:43.667 --> 00:09:45.605
<i>She did build this
giant place for me.</i>

00:09:45.705 --> 00:09:47.173
<i>I should be happy with that.</i>
(cha-ching)

00:09:47.273 --> 00:09:50.013
<i>But really, if she's made this
much money, I mean...</i>

00:09:50.113 --> 00:09:52.317
And I believe I know why
it is you have honored us

00:09:52.417 --> 00:09:54.254
with your presence today,
my Lord.

00:09:54.354 --> 00:09:57.962
[Gamma] This is about the
incident, is it not?
[Cid] What? Y-yes.

00:09:58.062 --> 00:10:00.868
[Gamma]
The killer who has appeared
in the Royal Capitol...

00:10:00.968 --> 00:10:02.470
The fools who donned
darkest black

00:10:02.571 --> 00:10:05.477
and claimed to be
Shadow Garden...

00:10:05.578 --> 00:10:07.815
We are currently investigating
the situation,

00:10:07.915 --> 00:10:10.186
but we have yet to apprehend
the perpetrators.

00:10:10.286 --> 00:10:13.627
But I swear to you that WE WILL
put an end to their misdeeds.

00:10:13.727 --> 00:10:14.829
That's great.

00:10:14.929 --> 00:10:16.533
<i>Oh, yeah,
Po and Skel were saying</i>

00:10:16.633 --> 00:10:18.571
<i>something about a killer.</i>

00:10:18.671 --> 00:10:20.206
<i>A killer?</i>

00:10:22.277 --> 00:10:23.847
<i>Ah ha...</i>

00:10:23.947 --> 00:10:27.087
I have an idea who it is.
I'll look into it.

00:10:27.187 --> 00:10:30.059
Incredible, you've already
arrived at the answer?

00:10:30.159 --> 00:10:31.362
No, I'm sorry.

00:10:31.462 --> 00:10:32.631
With your immense wisdom,
my Lord,

00:10:32.731 --> 00:10:34.669
I should have expected it.

00:10:36.907 --> 00:10:38.777
[Gamma] Step forward!

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:44.589
This is the most recent member
to join the numbers.

00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:46.292
Her name is Nu.

00:10:46.392 --> 00:10:47.595
She hasn't been with us long,

00:10:47.695 --> 00:10:50.066
but even Lady Alpha
acknowledges her skill.

00:10:51.435 --> 00:10:53.773
Please use her as you see fit.

00:10:54.174 --> 00:10:55.310
<i>Hmm...</i>

00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:58.315
Please know it is an honor to
serve you, my Lord.

00:10:59.586 --> 00:11:01.388
I'll call if I need you.

00:11:02.625 --> 00:11:04.194
[Cid] Huh?
[Gamma] Huh?

00:11:04.294 --> 00:11:06.900
Oh yeah,
I'd like to buy some chocolate.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.104
Give me three of
your cheapest packages.

00:11:09.204 --> 00:11:10.775
Chocolate?

00:11:10.875 --> 00:11:13.279
I shall procure you
some of our highest quality

00:11:13.379 --> 00:11:14.815
at a 100% discount.

00:11:14.916 --> 00:11:17.755
[Cid]
100%? That's like free! Sweet!

00:11:17.855 --> 00:11:19.424
[Gamma] Oh, you! (laughing)

00:11:19.526 --> 00:11:21.863
(both laughing)

00:11:27.608 --> 00:11:29.946
(footsteps running)

00:11:30.614 --> 00:11:32.150
(all gasping)

00:11:32.251 --> 00:11:34.488
Come on!
We're not gonna make curfew.

00:11:34.589 --> 00:11:35.792
It's all Cid's fault,

00:11:35.892 --> 00:11:38.129
flirting with that survey girl
for so long.

00:11:38.229 --> 00:11:41.368
I'm sorry, okay?
I gave you chocolate.

00:11:41.468 --> 00:11:43.740
<i>Man, can't believe Alexia
would go around</i>

00:11:43.841 --> 00:11:46.044
<i>killing people
indiscriminately.</i>

00:11:47.013 --> 00:11:49.251
<i>I guess she's finally lost it.</i>

00:11:51.222 --> 00:11:53.326
<i>She never made
any sense before,</i>

00:11:53.426 --> 00:11:55.864
<i>but she's a princess,
she has it all.</i>

00:11:55.964 --> 00:11:58.369
<i>What would make her
do these things?</i>

00:11:58.469 --> 00:11:59.806
(swords clashing)

00:11:59.906 --> 00:12:02.243
(all panting)

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:05.183
Hey, hurry it up, will ya?

00:12:05.283 --> 00:12:07.353
Come on,
we're gonna miss curfew!

00:12:11.897 --> 00:12:13.199
(swords clashing)

00:12:13.299 --> 00:12:14.434
Uh...

00:12:15.537 --> 00:12:16.640
(Cid grunting)
(both gasping)

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:18.376
(ungh) Poop...

00:12:18.476 --> 00:12:21.015
I have to... go poop.

00:12:21.115 --> 00:12:22.752
I can't hold it anymore.

00:12:22.852 --> 00:12:24.087
If I don't go right now,

00:12:24.187 --> 00:12:26.092
it's gonna drip down my leg
while I'm running.

00:12:26.192 --> 00:12:28.797
Oh, man,
that is pretty serious.

00:12:28.897 --> 00:12:32.572
A choice of honoring the rules,
or his personal honor.

00:12:32.672 --> 00:12:35.143
Just leave me here.
Go on without me.

00:12:35.243 --> 00:12:37.614
Please,
I don't want anyone to see this.

00:12:37.715 --> 00:12:39.384
But, Cid, wait!

00:12:39.484 --> 00:12:40.655
We understand.

00:12:40.755 --> 00:12:41.923
We'll never tell anyone that

00:12:42.023 --> 00:12:43.794
you took a dump outside.

00:12:43.894 --> 00:12:46.633
Man to man, you have my word!

00:12:46.733 --> 00:12:48.302
I don't give a crap
what anyone says.

00:12:48.402 --> 00:12:50.507
You made the right choice
here tonight.

00:12:50.607 --> 00:12:52.745
I'll always believe that.

00:12:52.846 --> 00:12:55.316
[Cid]
I can't... hold it any longer!

00:12:55.417 --> 00:12:56.351
Please just go!

00:12:56.451 --> 00:12:58.958
Oh, Cid,
we'll never forget your bravery.

00:12:59.058 --> 00:13:02.196
Poop outside, Cid!
We'll always be your friends.

00:13:02.665 --> 00:13:04.902
Go! Just go!

00:13:05.637 --> 00:13:07.541
(Skel and Po crying)

00:13:07.641 --> 00:13:09.979
(sappy sentimental music)

00:13:12.919 --> 00:13:14.387
Okay, then.

00:13:15.725 --> 00:13:17.361
<i>Alexia,
doesn't really bother me</i>

00:13:17.461 --> 00:13:20.267
<i>if you want to be
a homicidal maniac.</i>

00:13:20.367 --> 00:13:23.338
<i>If that's how you want it,
you do you.</i>

00:13:23.439 --> 00:13:25.777
<i>But if you're going to claim to
be from Shadow Garden,</i>

00:13:25.877 --> 00:13:27.314
<i>that's a different story.</i>
(swords clashing)

00:13:27.414 --> 00:13:30.286
<i>Sorry, I don't plan on letting
that go unpunished.</i>

00:13:32.424 --> 00:13:34.662
I've had enough of this.
Give it up!

00:13:34.763 --> 00:13:35.897
(dramatic music)

00:13:35.998 --> 00:13:38.937
[fake shadow]
We are Shadow Garden.

00:13:40.206 --> 00:13:42.512
[Alexia]
That's all you ever say.

00:13:42.612 --> 00:13:45.984
Is this really what the
so-called Shadow wants?

00:13:49.859 --> 00:13:51.361
Huh?

00:13:52.497 --> 00:13:54.635
(swords clashing)

00:14:06.025 --> 00:14:07.661
Time to put an end to this.

00:14:07.761 --> 00:14:09.431
(footsteps echoing)

00:14:10.433 --> 00:14:13.973
[Alexia] Oh,
I see your friends have arrived.

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:19.618
(swords clanging)

00:14:22.123 --> 00:14:24.494
(Alexia grunting)
(blood splattering)

00:14:25.564 --> 00:14:28.235
You would do this...
to a delicate maiden?

00:14:28.335 --> 00:14:30.941
(aggravated)
That's not very nice!

00:14:35.416 --> 00:14:37.554
(breathing heavily)

00:14:39.993 --> 00:14:42.263
We are Shadow Garden.

00:14:43.132 --> 00:14:45.504
(gasps)
(blood splattering)

00:14:45.938 --> 00:14:47.608
(THUD)

00:14:50.246 --> 00:14:53.085
[Alexia] Wait, are you...

00:14:53.185 --> 00:14:55.524
(tense techno music)

00:14:57.426 --> 00:15:00.534
Fool who assumes the name
of Shadow Garden...

00:15:00.634 --> 00:15:03.272
You will pay for this crime
with your life.

00:15:03.372 --> 00:15:05.510
(music swells)

00:15:13.459 --> 00:15:15.129
Wait a minute!

00:15:15.229 --> 00:15:18.369
Tell me, what is it that
you are trying to do?

00:15:18.469 --> 00:15:21.776
What do you use all that
magical power for?

00:15:21.876 --> 00:15:24.247
(weakly)
What are you fighting against?

00:15:27.956 --> 00:15:29.625
Stay out of it.

00:15:32.965 --> 00:15:35.704
Wait, please... come back...

00:15:41.883 --> 00:15:44.220
(classical music)

00:15:48.196 --> 00:15:50.099
(gack)
(blood splattering)

00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:54.542
Don't tell me,
you actually thought

00:15:54.642 --> 00:15:55.911
you could get away from me.

00:15:56.011 --> 00:15:57.446
(gasps)

00:15:57.548 --> 00:15:58.784
[Nu] Brilliant.

00:15:58.884 --> 00:16:00.153
(gasps)

00:16:00.253 --> 00:16:01.990
Well done, Lord Shadow.

00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:05.196
To think anyone could
apprehend them so quickly...

00:16:05.296 --> 00:16:07.234
Please,
let me take it from here.

00:16:07.334 --> 00:16:09.672
I will get information
from them.

00:16:13.646 --> 00:16:14.715
[Shadow] Don't mess it up.

00:16:14.815 --> 00:16:15.884
[Nu] I won't.

00:16:15.984 --> 00:16:17.521
[fake shadow] Damn it all!

00:16:17.955 --> 00:16:19.457
You're dead!

00:16:26.539 --> 00:16:28.910
Sadly for you,

00:16:29.010 --> 00:16:31.482
I am not as forgiving
as Lord Shadow.

00:16:31.583 --> 00:16:33.418
(gasps)

00:16:35.891 --> 00:16:39.632
[cult member]
I've lost contact with our
human puppet and two others.

00:16:40.166 --> 00:16:41.334
(man chuckling)

00:16:41.434 --> 00:16:44.174
So, the killer has
gotten himself killed.

00:16:44.274 --> 00:16:46.980
What do we do about it,
Mr. Gaunt Knight?

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:49.585
Nothing,
we've learned the whereabouts

00:16:49.685 --> 00:16:51.321
of the item in question.

00:16:51.421 --> 00:16:53.727
Retrieving it is
our top priority.

00:16:53.827 --> 00:16:54.896
(man laughing)

00:16:54.996 --> 00:16:57.333
(gentle music)

00:16:58.537 --> 00:17:00.907
[Iris] Anyway, I'm glad
you're all right.

00:17:01.007 --> 00:17:02.310
And you're saying
that the killer

00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:03.478
was NOT from Shadow Garden,

00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:05.283
but was from a
different organization

00:17:05.383 --> 00:17:07.220
that falsely assumed the name?

00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:09.592
Yes,
that's what Shadow told me.

00:17:10.561 --> 00:17:12.263
I met someone from
Shadow Garden

00:17:12.363 --> 00:17:14.067
when I was defending
the Royal Capital

00:17:14.167 --> 00:17:17.306
from those multiple
simultaneous attacks.

00:17:17.406 --> 00:17:19.645
[Alexia]
And you said her name was Alpha?

00:17:21.716 --> 00:17:22.785
[Alexia] What's wrong, Iris?

00:17:22.885 --> 00:17:24.589
Huh?

00:17:24.689 --> 00:17:26.191
It's nothing.

00:17:26.291 --> 00:17:28.495
The other reports have all
confirmed what you've said.

00:17:28.596 --> 00:17:31.468
They possess an enormous
power in combat.

00:17:31.569 --> 00:17:33.906
But I can't learn
any more than that.

00:17:34.007 --> 00:17:35.376
Shadow told me that
he was fighting

00:17:35.476 --> 00:17:37.948
against the Cult of Diablos.

00:17:38.048 --> 00:17:40.654
[Iris] Then I suppose
that is our best lead.

00:17:40.754 --> 00:17:42.991
We may discover something
once the artifact

00:17:43.091 --> 00:17:45.095
has been deciphered.

00:17:45.797 --> 00:17:47.133
Iris...

00:17:47.234 --> 00:17:49.237
Who do you think
is your real enemy?

00:17:49.338 --> 00:17:52.310
Shadow Garden or
the Cult of Diablos?

00:17:54.982 --> 00:17:56.051
[Iris] Both.

00:17:56.151 --> 00:17:57.654
(gasps)

00:17:58.656 --> 00:18:02.564
Because no one is
destroying my kingdom.

00:18:08.744 --> 00:18:10.179
(train chugging)

00:18:10.279 --> 00:18:11.917
[students] Check it out, man!
I think that's him.

00:18:12.017 --> 00:18:15.122
-The guy who crapped his pants
while running home.
-The what?!

00:18:15.222 --> 00:18:17.460
[Skel] Th-that was bad luck
yesterday, huh?

00:18:17.562 --> 00:18:19.765
[Po]
Yeah, it was really rough, man.

00:18:19.865 --> 00:18:21.368
I dunno, I think today's exam

00:18:21.468 --> 00:18:22.872
is actually gonna be
a lot worse.

00:18:22.972 --> 00:18:24.474
(both gasp)

00:18:24.575 --> 00:18:25.711
Ah, anyway!

00:18:25.811 --> 00:18:26.913
Did you bring the crap-

00:18:27.013 --> 00:18:29.183
I mean, the chocolate
from yesterday?

00:18:30.654 --> 00:18:31.990
Yes, I brought it.

00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:34.193
[Skel]
Awesome, "Operation Gift Giver."

00:18:34.294 --> 00:18:37.266
[Po]
(sketchy snickers) I can't wait!

00:18:38.102 --> 00:18:40.439
(Skel stuttering)

00:18:43.111 --> 00:18:46.451
I have ch-ch-chocolate for you.

00:18:47.921 --> 00:18:49.257
(weirded out)

00:18:49.357 --> 00:18:50.628
Look at Skel!

00:18:50.728 --> 00:18:52.497
I can't believe he went
for an upperclass woman.

00:18:52.598 --> 00:18:54.234
<i>Nothing less for my handpicked,</i>

00:18:54.334 --> 00:18:56.104
<i>natural-born
background character.</i>

00:18:56.204 --> 00:18:57.508
[guy] Hey!

00:18:57.608 --> 00:19:00.013
What are you doing talking to
my betrothed, buddy?

00:19:00.113 --> 00:19:01.983
No, I, uh...

00:19:02.083 --> 00:19:03.352
[guy] Come with me, my friend,

00:19:03.452 --> 00:19:05.289
and let's you and me
have a little chat.

00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:08.329
[gal] Fine, but I'm
keeping the chocolate.
[Skel] What?!

00:19:08.429 --> 00:19:10.299
[guy] You got a problem
with that or something?

00:19:10.399 --> 00:19:11.969
[Skel] Uh, no, um...

00:19:12.069 --> 00:19:13.873
(distantly) Help me, help!

00:19:13.973 --> 00:19:15.710
[Po]
Well, I guess we're done here.

00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:17.313
[Cid] Yep.

00:19:18.817 --> 00:19:21.288
[Po] What happened to Skel
will never happen to me.

00:19:21.388 --> 00:19:22.591
I've learned all about it!

00:19:22.691 --> 00:19:24.461
From her friendships to her
favorite food...

00:19:24.562 --> 00:19:26.533
The times, routes, pace
and numbers of steps

00:19:26.633 --> 00:19:28.335
she uses to walk to
and from school...

00:19:28.435 --> 00:19:30.206
As well as her skirt length,
the color of her panties,

00:19:30.306 --> 00:19:32.010
and her bust, waist,
and hip measurements.

00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:34.247
I am Po Tato, the ladies man!

00:19:34.347 --> 00:19:36.753
Yeah-hoo, my fair lady!

00:19:36.853 --> 00:19:37.988
(girl screams)

00:19:38.089 --> 00:19:39.424
It's the guy who's
been stalking me!

00:19:39.525 --> 00:19:41.361
[Po] No, I haven't! Cid!

00:19:41.461 --> 00:19:42.798
[boys] What, a stalker?

00:19:42.898 --> 00:19:44.500
-You stupid spud-head!

00:19:44.601 --> 00:19:47.373
[Kagenou]
<i>I guess I'll just give this
to the first girl I see,</i>

00:19:47.474 --> 00:19:50.145
<i>so this background character
event will come to an end.</i>

00:19:50.245 --> 00:19:51.749
(sighing)

00:19:53.018 --> 00:19:55.691
I knew it.
This code is very much

00:19:55.791 --> 00:19:58.830
like the one my mother
had been researching.

00:20:01.936 --> 00:20:03.773
[Cid] Here.
[Sherry] Huh?

00:20:04.976 --> 00:20:06.144
You can have that chocolate.

00:20:06.244 --> 00:20:07.948
Ah, thank you?

00:20:16.967 --> 00:20:19.404
That's the boy.

00:20:19.505 --> 00:20:21.842
(people talking indistinctly)

00:20:38.275 --> 00:20:40.580
I wonder what this is?

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:43.619
(door opens)
(father coughing)

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:44.855
[Sherry] Father!

00:20:44.955 --> 00:20:47.327
[father] Well, it looks like
you have some chocolate.

00:20:47.427 --> 00:20:48.530
What's chocolate?

00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:50.132
[father]
It's a high-end confection

00:20:50.232 --> 00:20:51.636
that's very popular these days.

00:20:51.736 --> 00:20:54.709
A boy handed it to me
this afternoon.

00:20:54.809 --> 00:20:55.877
Oh, really?

00:20:55.977 --> 00:20:58.081
He must have meant it
as a present for you.

00:20:58.182 --> 00:20:59.217
Don't you think?

00:20:59.317 --> 00:21:00.687
[Sherry] Huh?
(father chuckles)

00:21:00.787 --> 00:21:04.127
It's what we call
"love at first sight."

00:21:04.227 --> 00:21:06.732
Love at first sight?

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:08.903
(gentle music)

00:21:09.003 --> 00:21:11.374
What are you going to tell him?

00:21:11.474 --> 00:21:12.811
I'm sure he is waiting for you

00:21:12.911 --> 00:21:14.180
to respond in some way.

00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:17.587
But... But I'm... I've got...

00:21:17.687 --> 00:21:19.391
Your research is important

00:21:19.491 --> 00:21:22.397
but you also need to learn
how to interact with others.

00:21:22.497 --> 00:21:25.637
That's an important part
of your school life.

00:21:25.737 --> 00:21:28.810
Anyway, tell me,
how is this going?

00:21:28.910 --> 00:21:31.982
[Sherry] I've only just
gotten started, so...

00:21:32.083 --> 00:21:33.920
Yes, of course.

00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:36.357
(coughing)

00:21:39.131 --> 00:21:40.199
[Sherry] Father!

00:21:40.299 --> 00:21:41.234
I'm sorry.

00:21:41.334 --> 00:21:42.905
I'll call a doctor right away.

00:21:43.005 --> 00:21:44.473
I... I'm fine.

00:21:44.575 --> 00:21:47.346
I'll be okay.
Don't worry about me.

00:21:47.446 --> 00:21:51.121
I've been feeling so much
healthier lately, really.

00:21:51.221 --> 00:21:54.962
(sighs) I'm just thankful to
have such a loving daughter.

00:21:55.062 --> 00:21:56.431
I'm the lucky one.

00:21:56.532 --> 00:21:58.570
If you hadn't adopted me
when you did,

00:21:58.670 --> 00:22:00.907
I don't know what
I would've done.

00:22:02.443 --> 00:22:04.781
(gentle music)

00:22:06.484 --> 00:22:08.923
Your mother was an
excellent researcher too.

00:22:09.023 --> 00:22:10.292
She'd be so proud.

00:22:10.392 --> 00:22:12.429
You can do this, my love.

00:22:14.434 --> 00:22:17.072
[Sherry] Thank you, Father.

00:22:21.014 --> 00:22:23.351
