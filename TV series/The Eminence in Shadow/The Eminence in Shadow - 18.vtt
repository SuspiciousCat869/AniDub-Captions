00:00:01.604 --> 00:00:03.741
(mysterious music)

00:00:05.244 --> 00:00:07.516
[Kagenou] <i>When emotion provokes
interpersonal conflict,</i>

00:00:07.616 --> 00:00:10.387
<i>generally time is enough
to solve the problem.</i>

00:00:10.487 --> 00:00:13.527
<i>Therefore,
ignore it and it will go away.</i>

00:00:13.627 --> 00:00:16.365
<i>That's the theory that
I would like to advocate for.</i>

00:00:16.465 --> 00:00:20.006
<i>But it looks like my sister
hasn't had quite enough time.</i>

00:00:20.106 --> 00:00:22.612
Do you have any idea
what I thought about

00:00:22.712 --> 00:00:25.819
while I waited for you
in front of your dorm?

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:27.588
[Cid] No, I do not. (chokes)

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.995
[Claire] I was beating you into
a bloody pulp in my mind,

00:00:31.095 --> 00:00:33.534
over and over, again and again.

00:00:33.634 --> 00:00:37.274
But for every second I waited,
my rage doubled in size.

00:00:37.374 --> 00:00:39.078
[Kagenou]
<i>Today I learned that some anger</i>

00:00:39.178 --> 00:00:41.183
<i>actually increases with time.</i>

00:00:41.283 --> 00:00:43.286
I bet you're thinking
that you don't care.

00:00:43.386 --> 00:00:45.257
No, that's not true. (chokes)

00:00:45.357 --> 00:00:46.760
Let's do a little experiment,

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.900
and see just how long a person
can hold their breath.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.970
When a person is strangled,
they pass out

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.643
ecause their carotid artery
is being blocked.

00:00:54.743 --> 00:00:57.415
It has nothing to do
with their breathing.

00:00:57.516 --> 00:00:59.351
[Claire]
Either way works for me.

00:00:59.451 --> 00:01:01.757
You promised me that we would
go back home together

00:01:01.857 --> 00:01:03.728
during the summer holidays.

00:01:03.828 --> 00:01:05.197
[Cid] I said that?

00:01:05.297 --> 00:01:07.167
You always do this to me.

00:01:07.267 --> 00:01:08.469
You break your promises to me

00:01:08.571 --> 00:01:10.474
like they mean nothing
to you at all.

00:01:10.575 --> 00:01:13.847
[Cid] I'll try to become a
person who can keep his word.

00:01:14.583 --> 00:01:15.819
(chokes)

00:01:15.919 --> 00:01:18.256
(mysterious music)

00:01:19.225 --> 00:01:20.260
(deep breath)

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.966
[Claire]
This is your last chance.

00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:24.301
[Cid] What is that?

00:01:24.401 --> 00:01:26.039
[Claire] A ticket to the
reserved seating area

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:27.374
at the Bushin Festival.

00:01:27.474 --> 00:01:29.579
It's nearly impossible
to get one.

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:32.852
I'm giving it to you,
so watch the fights and learn.

00:01:32.952 --> 00:01:34.222
[Cid] Come to think of it,

00:01:34.322 --> 00:01:36.092
weren't you sitting the
festival out this year?

00:01:36.192 --> 00:01:39.231
[Claire] No. I was chosen to
represent the Academy

00:01:39.331 --> 00:01:40.968
in Princess Rose's place.

00:01:41.068 --> 00:01:43.774
Please don't try to tell me you
didn't know about that.

00:01:43.874 --> 00:01:47.181
[Cid] Of course I knew. I was
just checking, that's all.

00:01:47.281 --> 00:01:49.319
[Claire] If you want to live
a long, healthy life,

00:01:49.419 --> 00:01:51.791
you should stop neglecting
your big sister.

00:01:51.891 --> 00:01:53.327
[Cid] Yes, ma'am.

00:01:53.427 --> 00:01:55.364
I will be the next champion,

00:01:55.464 --> 00:01:57.803
and you better be
there to see it.

00:01:57.903 --> 00:01:59.438
Yes, ma'am.

00:02:00.206 --> 00:02:02.545
(Cid gasping and groaning)

00:02:06.988 --> 00:02:09.324
(OPENING THEME)

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:39.371
[Alexia] She moved out?

00:03:39.471 --> 00:03:41.076
[landlady]
She did, the other day.

00:03:41.176 --> 00:03:42.311
She just up and left.

00:03:42.411 --> 00:03:43.480
She said she would be spending

00:03:43.581 --> 00:03:45.918
a long time abroad
doing research.

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:01.817
"Oriana Kingdom Principle
Enterprises and Religious
Organizations,

00:04:01.917 --> 00:04:04.455
and Their Various Relations
to the Monarchy."

00:04:04.556 --> 00:04:06.960
So she's blessing me
with information?

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.499
She really is quite
insufferable.

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.937
(fireworks exploding)

00:04:15.912 --> 00:04:20.522
I hate to break it to you,
but I don't need your pity.

00:04:20.622 --> 00:04:26.566
After all, I simply refuse to
pity myself any longer.

00:04:27.769 --> 00:04:30.306
(fireworks exploding)
(dramatic music)

00:04:31.978 --> 00:04:34.314
(crowd cheering)

00:04:45.003 --> 00:04:47.708
[Kagenou] <i>This is not just
reserved seating.</i>

00:04:49.345 --> 00:04:51.850
<i>This is hyper VIP seating.</i>

00:04:53.821 --> 00:04:56.794
<i>I should have at least worn my
school uniform.</i>

00:04:56.894 --> 00:04:59.999
[noble] But are you sure you
don't mind sitting here with us?

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:03.472
[Iris] It's important for me to
mingle with my underclassmen.

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.013
And who might you be?

00:05:08.049 --> 00:05:09.385
My humble name is Cid Kagenou,

00:05:09.485 --> 00:05:11.790
and I appear to have come to
the wrong seat.

00:05:11.891 --> 00:05:15.665
Kagenou? Of course, you must be
Claire's younger brother,

00:05:15.765 --> 00:05:18.336
and the boy from the incident.

00:05:18.436 --> 00:05:19.973
So you know my sister, huh?

00:05:20.073 --> 00:05:21.810
I do. I met her several times

00:05:21.911 --> 00:05:24.481
when she came to
observe the Knights.

00:05:24.582 --> 00:05:25.818
After she graduates,

00:05:25.918 --> 00:05:28.924
I plan to assign Claire
to my personal order.

00:05:29.024 --> 00:05:30.961
You are definitely at
the correct seat,

00:05:31.061 --> 00:05:34.636
because I'm assuming that
Claire gave you her ticket,
right?

00:05:35.604 --> 00:05:37.274
[Cid] Thank you, Your Highness.

00:05:37.374 --> 00:05:40.414
[Iris] So, Cid Kagenou,
I owe you an apology.

00:05:40.515 --> 00:05:42.251
I'm sorry for the
trouble I caused you

00:05:42.351 --> 00:05:44.155
during the
Zenon Griffey incident.

00:05:44.255 --> 00:05:46.860
[Cid]
Oh, right, don't worry about it.

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.198
[Iris] We've already ended
talks settling the matters

00:05:49.298 --> 00:05:51.302
between the royal family
and the Marquess.

00:05:51.402 --> 00:05:52.972
But as Alexia's older sister,

00:05:53.072 --> 00:05:56.913
I hope you'll be willing to
accept my personal apology.

00:05:57.447 --> 00:05:58.751
Of course.

00:05:58.851 --> 00:06:00.454
[Kagenou] <i>Sitting here
having a named character</i>

00:06:00.555 --> 00:06:02.859
<i>asking my forgiveness?
That's the worst thing</i>

00:06:02.959 --> 00:06:04.963
<i>for my
background character persona!</i>

00:06:05.064 --> 00:06:08.704
[Iris] I hope you won't let the
incident sour your friendship
with her.

00:06:08.804 --> 00:06:10.708
[Cid]
Friendship? Well, I don't know.

00:06:10.808 --> 00:06:13.614
All I did was pick up the coins
she tossed at me.

00:06:13.714 --> 00:06:15.216
Wait, she tossed coins at you?

00:06:15.316 --> 00:06:18.389
Like when you throw a stick for
a dog and tell it to go fetch.

00:06:18.489 --> 00:06:21.563
So the two of you played fetch
with a dog together?

00:06:21.663 --> 00:06:26.305
[Cid] Not WITH the dog so much
as I WAS the dog. Never mind.

00:06:26.405 --> 00:06:29.712
[Iris]
My sister's very happy to have
made such a good friend.

00:06:30.514 --> 00:06:31.783
[Cid] I don't know about that...

00:06:31.884 --> 00:06:33.019
(crowd cheering)

00:06:33.119 --> 00:06:35.023
[Iris] In fact, Alexia was
supposed to join me today,

00:06:35.123 --> 00:06:38.230
but she suddenly decided she
didn't wanna come.

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:39.700
I wish she would have.

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.437
[Cid] Oh, that's all right.
Don't even worry about it.

00:06:42.538 --> 00:06:46.312
Which of the competitors have
caught your eye this year,
Princess?

00:06:46.412 --> 00:06:48.150
I'm interested to know as well.

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:49.451
Hmm...

00:06:49.552 --> 00:06:51.456
[Iris] I have my eye on
all the competitors

00:06:51.557 --> 00:06:53.059
fighting in the
main tournament,

00:06:53.159 --> 00:06:56.533
but if I had to pick one,
I would say Annerose,

00:06:56.633 --> 00:06:59.839
the former member of
Velgalta's Seven Blades.

00:06:59.939 --> 00:07:02.411
There are many familiar faces
in the tournament lineup,

00:07:02.512 --> 00:07:04.214
but this is her
first year competing.

00:07:04.314 --> 00:07:05.718
[nobles]
I watched her matches too,

00:07:05.818 --> 00:07:07.253
and she was quite impressive.

00:07:07.354 --> 00:07:10.393
If I were to fight her right
now, I doubt I could beat her.

00:07:10.493 --> 00:07:11.663
-I've seen her too.

00:07:11.763 --> 00:07:13.968
But Princess Iris
will be the champion.

00:07:14.068 --> 00:07:17.775
I know the Royal Bushin method
has been unpopular since the
incident,

00:07:17.875 --> 00:07:20.615
but if Princess Iris is the one
who wins the tournament, then-

00:07:20.715 --> 00:07:22.350
Hush now, you know
it's not fair

00:07:22.451 --> 00:07:23.620
to put that kind of
pressure on her!

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:26.058
Sorry, I didn't mean to.
I just thought-

00:07:26.158 --> 00:07:27.394
It's all right.
(both gasp)

00:07:27.494 --> 00:07:29.900
It was always my plan
to win the tournament.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.270
I know the fate of the
Royal Bushin method,

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:34.609
and of our kingdom,
depends on me.

00:07:34.709 --> 00:07:36.680
[Cid] Um...
[Iris] Oh!

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:39.185
Are there any other fighters
in the festival worth watching?

00:07:39.285 --> 00:07:41.155
That reminds me.
Who is that boy?

00:07:41.255 --> 00:07:42.424
A student at the Academy.

00:07:42.525 --> 00:07:44.027
You know,
he was that white coat

00:07:44.127 --> 00:07:46.566
they got to practice with
Section One in fencing class.

00:07:46.666 --> 00:07:49.539
Oh yeah, I remember now.
He was Alexia's boyfriend.

00:07:49.639 --> 00:07:50.975
[Iris] This is Cid Kagenou.

00:07:51.075 --> 00:07:53.814
He happens to be Claire's
younger brother.

00:07:53.914 --> 00:07:56.219
Claire and Cid have a very
special relationship

00:07:56.319 --> 00:07:57.387
as brother and sister.

00:07:57.487 --> 00:07:58.757
Hey, isn't he the one who-

00:07:58.857 --> 00:07:59.826
Hush you.

00:07:59.927 --> 00:08:01.830
Ah, yeah, right.
Unlike your sister,

00:08:01.931 --> 00:08:03.868
your fencing is
totally uninspiring,

00:08:03.968 --> 00:08:06.773
but setting your sights
too high won't get you
anywhere either.

00:08:06.873 --> 00:08:09.545
She's right, you know.
Just take it slow and steady.

00:08:09.645 --> 00:08:12.117
Just don't get any ideas
about grand ambitions

00:08:12.217 --> 00:08:13.353
or marrying into power.

00:08:13.453 --> 00:08:14.856
Gee, thanks.

00:08:14.956 --> 00:08:17.127
So you think there are any
other fighters worth watching?

00:08:17.227 --> 00:08:20.601
Like maybe that guy Annerose
will be fighting in the
first round.

00:08:20.701 --> 00:08:23.072
You know, that Mundane Mann.

00:08:23.172 --> 00:08:25.443
This is his first time
in the tournament too.

00:08:25.545 --> 00:08:26.847
Mundane Mann...

00:08:26.947 --> 00:08:28.482
I haven't seen
any of his matches,

00:08:28.583 --> 00:08:29.653
so I really couldn't say.

00:08:29.753 --> 00:08:31.188
Oh, I've seen him in a match.

00:08:31.288 --> 00:08:33.861
He moves fast, but that's
pretty much all he can do.

00:08:33.961 --> 00:08:35.899
His stance is super amateur.

00:08:35.999 --> 00:08:38.169
He's not really
main tournament material.

00:08:38.269 --> 00:08:40.908
It's all just momentum and
luck. He has no real skill.

00:08:41.008 --> 00:08:44.649
[Kagenou]
<i>Yes! I've cultivated Mundane's
reputation to perfection.</i>

00:08:44.749 --> 00:08:46.419
There is another person
to watch for.

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:49.191
However, she's not
participating this year.

00:08:49.291 --> 00:08:52.164
An elf swordmaster hailed
as the War Goddess.

00:08:52.264 --> 00:08:54.769
She was the first champion
of the Bushin Festival.

00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:57.106
An elf swordmaster?
You don't mean-

00:08:57.207 --> 00:09:00.514
But she has not shown her face
in public in over a decade.

00:09:00.614 --> 00:09:02.619
Every warrior fighting
in the main tournament

00:09:02.719 --> 00:09:05.724
will be paying careful
attention to Lady Beatrix.

00:09:06.325 --> 00:09:08.329
[Kagenou] <i>Beatrix?</i>

00:09:08.429 --> 00:09:09.832
<i>I figured she was pretty tough,</i>

00:09:09.932 --> 00:09:12.404
<i>but I didn't realize
she was famous.</i>

00:09:12.505 --> 00:09:13.807
What's the matter, Cid?

00:09:13.907 --> 00:09:15.912
[Cid]
I'm going to powder my nose.

00:09:16.012 --> 00:09:18.784
[ref]
The winner is Imatry Nottaloos!

00:09:18.884 --> 00:09:22.290
[Imatry] Yeah, ha, ha!
(crowd cheering)

00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:23.894
Hmm?

00:09:26.867 --> 00:09:28.436
[Kagenou]
<i>There's someone strong nearby.</i>

00:09:28.537 --> 00:09:29.806
<i>If we were two eminences,</i>

00:09:29.906 --> 00:09:31.910
<i>we would exchange some
super cool dialogue</i>

00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:33.947
<i>even in the briefest
encounter,</i>

00:09:34.047 --> 00:09:36.218
<i>but I'm in
background character mode.</i>

00:09:36.318 --> 00:09:37.822
[Beatrix] Cid.

00:09:41.462 --> 00:09:42.999
(yelps) Ah, I, ah, you are-

00:09:43.099 --> 00:09:43.834
I am Beatrix.

00:09:43.934 --> 00:09:45.772
Yes, right, right, Beatrix.

00:09:45.872 --> 00:09:47.408
Were you ignoring me?

00:09:47.509 --> 00:09:49.044
I wasn't ignoring you.

00:09:49.144 --> 00:09:50.046
You weren't?

00:09:50.146 --> 00:09:51.148
No, I was not.

00:09:51.248 --> 00:09:52.183
Are you sure?

00:09:52.284 --> 00:09:53.286
Yes, I am sure.

00:09:53.386 --> 00:09:54.387
You weren't?

00:09:54.487 --> 00:09:57.194
I wasn't.

00:09:57.294 --> 00:10:00.601
Did you run into an elf
that looks like me
since the last time?

00:10:00.701 --> 00:10:03.005
Nope,
no elves that look like you.

00:10:03.105 --> 00:10:04.709
Okay...

00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:06.579
A lot of people
come to this event,

00:10:06.679 --> 00:10:09.051
so I thought I might
be able to find her.

00:10:09.151 --> 00:10:12.057
[Cid] It is a really popular
sword fighting tournament.

00:10:12.157 --> 00:10:14.227
Mind if I ask you
about the bag?

00:10:14.328 --> 00:10:15.229
I bought these.

00:10:15.329 --> 00:10:16.232
Oh, you bought them?

00:10:16.332 --> 00:10:17.401
I bought too many.

00:10:17.502 --> 00:10:19.104
Yeah, that's too many.

00:10:19.204 --> 00:10:20.273
You can have one.

00:10:20.373 --> 00:10:21.609
Oh, thank you.

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:24.215
And to show my gratitude,
take this.

00:10:24.315 --> 00:10:25.483
You can have this one.

00:10:25.585 --> 00:10:27.153
Why, thank you.

00:10:27.253 --> 00:10:28.155
Well, bye.

00:10:28.255 --> 00:10:29.759
Bye.

00:10:37.307 --> 00:10:39.645
(quiet conversations)

00:10:45.022 --> 00:10:46.526
Hmm?

00:10:46.626 --> 00:10:48.263
Hello, Lord Perv Asshat.

00:10:48.363 --> 00:10:51.134
And how are you doing today,
Princess Iris?

00:10:51.235 --> 00:10:53.473
[Iris] That seat is-
[Perv] Is what?

00:10:53.574 --> 00:10:56.111
These seats are reserved for
students only, I'm afraid.

00:10:56.211 --> 00:10:58.817
That's all right. See,
I think the young people here

00:10:58.917 --> 00:11:00.655
will have the opportunity
to learn a lot

00:11:00.755 --> 00:11:03.059
from seeing me interact with
you in public.

00:11:03.159 --> 00:11:05.129
I'm confident they won't
have any regrets

00:11:05.229 --> 00:11:07.502
learning how to entertain a
beautiful princess

00:11:07.602 --> 00:11:08.804
such as yourself.

00:11:08.904 --> 00:11:10.340
Enough of your jests.

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:14.047
I believe you are already
engaged to marry, Lord Asshat.

00:11:14.147 --> 00:11:15.584
[Perv] As you are well aware,

00:11:15.684 --> 00:11:17.956
we are in the middle of a
little lover's spat,

00:11:18.056 --> 00:11:20.728
but I do believe she will
come back to me soon.

00:11:20.828 --> 00:11:23.600
[Iris] Am I to assume
you're here alone?

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:26.305
[Perv] Yes, unfortunately,
our esteemed king

00:11:26.405 --> 00:11:27.975
is feeling out of sorts today.

00:11:28.075 --> 00:11:29.745
I'm truly and deeply sorry that

00:11:29.845 --> 00:11:31.950
the security detail you
kindly assigned to him

00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:33.921
has turned out to be
unnecessary.

00:11:34.021 --> 00:11:35.791
[Iris] That's not a problem.

00:11:35.891 --> 00:11:38.129
[Perv] He is bound and
determined to attend tomorrow,

00:11:38.229 --> 00:11:40.768
so I do hope
you'll forgive him.

00:11:40.868 --> 00:11:42.872
Incidentally, is your father,

00:11:42.972 --> 00:11:45.778
His Majesty King Klaus,
absent today?

00:11:45.878 --> 00:11:47.682
[Iris] King Klaus said
he will come to watch

00:11:47.782 --> 00:11:49.753
the fights starting tomorrow.

00:11:49.853 --> 00:11:52.858
My, what a coincidence.

00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:57.535
Hold on, is that the infamous
Annerose Nichtsehen?

00:11:57.635 --> 00:11:58.670
[Iris] Yes.

00:11:58.770 --> 00:11:59.973
[Perv]
She is currently the fencer

00:12:00.073 --> 00:12:01.576
with the most momentum
in this tournament.

00:12:01.676 --> 00:12:04.448
I understand she's in the
middle of a training
pilgrimage,

00:12:04.549 --> 00:12:07.688
but I would love to invite her
to work for our kingdom.

00:12:07.788 --> 00:12:09.058
[Iris] Indeed.

00:12:09.158 --> 00:12:11.730
A fencer of her caliber would
be a great benefit

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:13.834
to the Midgar Kingdom as well.

00:12:13.934 --> 00:12:15.470
[Perv] Such avarice.

00:12:15.571 --> 00:12:17.908
Does the Midgar Kingdom not
have more than enough

00:12:18.008 --> 00:12:19.812
excellent Dark Knights already?

00:12:19.912 --> 00:12:22.050
On the other hand,
my kingdom is obsessed

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:24.756
with the childish idea of
employing dancing knights.

00:12:24.856 --> 00:12:26.693
That is why we have
an alliance.

00:12:26.793 --> 00:12:29.097
If necessary,
our powerful Kight Order

00:12:29.197 --> 00:12:32.104
will dispel the darkness
that enfolds your nation.

00:12:32.204 --> 00:12:34.775
(chuckles)
That is very comforting indeed.

00:12:34.875 --> 00:12:37.247
By the way, what do you think
of her opponent,

00:12:37.347 --> 00:12:38.850
that Mundane fellow?

00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:41.222
[Iris] This will be the first
time I've seen him fight,

00:12:41.322 --> 00:12:43.226
but he doesn't seem
very strong.

00:12:43.326 --> 00:12:46.298
[Perv] Then you're sure
Annerose will win?

00:12:46.398 --> 00:12:47.467
[Iris] No.

00:12:47.568 --> 00:12:48.804
This Mundane Mann...

00:12:48.904 --> 00:12:50.440
He's a little unnerving.

00:12:50.541 --> 00:12:51.876
He certainly doesn't
look strong,

00:12:51.976 --> 00:12:53.179
but there's one thing about him

00:12:53.279 --> 00:12:55.316
that you would never see
in a weak fighter.

00:12:55.416 --> 00:12:57.387
[Perv] Oh, and that is?

00:12:57.487 --> 00:12:59.190
Absolute confidence.

00:12:59.291 --> 00:13:01.763
There is no uncertainty
in his eyes.

00:13:01.863 --> 00:13:03.065
Those are the eyes of a man

00:13:03.166 --> 00:13:05.236
who can see a path
to total victory.

00:13:05.336 --> 00:13:08.375
Interesting, I would never have
guessed that about him.

00:13:08.475 --> 00:13:11.482
I'm afraid I know
nothing of swordplay.

00:13:11.583 --> 00:13:16.526
(chuckles)
Of course, there's no fooling
the great Princess Iris.

00:13:16.626 --> 00:13:18.229
Please forgive me,
but swordplay is

00:13:18.329 --> 00:13:20.901
looked down upon
in the Oriana Kingdom.

00:13:21.001 --> 00:13:22.171
However, I'll admit,

00:13:22.271 --> 00:13:24.508
I do have some proficiency
with the blade.

00:13:24.608 --> 00:13:26.311
You have SOME proficiency?

00:13:26.411 --> 00:13:31.656
Now then... You say he has
absolute confidence.

00:13:31.756 --> 00:13:35.096
How much is that
confidence worth?

00:13:35.196 --> 00:13:37.568
(crowd cheering)
(dramatic music)

00:13:42.344 --> 00:13:44.649
[Annerose] <i>The secret to
this man's strength</i>

00:13:44.749 --> 00:13:47.354
<i>is his overwhelming speed.</i>

00:13:47.454 --> 00:13:51.696
<i>And he hasn't even shown us
the full extent of it.</i>

00:13:51.797 --> 00:13:54.669
<i>But his sword technique is no
better than an amateur,</i>

00:13:54.769 --> 00:13:56.807
<i>and his stance is a mess.</i>

00:13:56.907 --> 00:13:58.475
<i>In that case...</i>

00:13:58.577 --> 00:14:00.446
(dramatic music)

00:14:00.547 --> 00:14:04.655
[Ref] Annerose Nichtsehen
versus Mundane Mann!

00:14:04.755 --> 00:14:06.592
Ready, fight!

00:14:07.562 --> 00:14:09.197
[Annerose]
<i>If I can stop him from moving,</i>

00:14:09.297 --> 00:14:10.834
<i>he'll have no way to beat me.</i>

00:14:10.934 --> 00:14:12.336
(swords clang)

00:14:12.436 --> 00:14:15.911
<i>He managed to parry in time,
but I knew he would.</i>

00:14:16.011 --> 00:14:17.280
(sword whooshing)

00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:19.118
<i>As long as I don't
give him a chance</i>

00:14:19.218 --> 00:14:21.956
<i>to make use of his speed,
sooner or later...</i>

00:14:22.057 --> 00:14:24.394
(dramatic music)

00:14:25.831 --> 00:14:27.300
[Annerose] <i>I've won!</i>

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:29.037
(schwing)

00:14:29.672 --> 00:14:31.174
(gasps)

00:14:31.943 --> 00:14:33.580
That was an after image.

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:35.182
(gasps)

00:14:35.818 --> 00:14:38.155
(dramatic music)

00:14:39.926 --> 00:14:42.430
<i>He's even faster
than I imagined!</i>

00:14:45.036 --> 00:14:47.206
<i>How can I turn the tables?</i>

00:14:48.242 --> 00:14:50.614
(explosion)
(dramatic music)

00:14:53.085 --> 00:14:56.158
(growls) If he had put any
magic into that attack,

00:14:56.258 --> 00:14:58.697
I would definitely
be dead by now.

00:14:58.797 --> 00:15:01.736
I admit it!
You're strong.

00:15:01.836 --> 00:15:04.174
Strong beyond all reason.

00:15:04.274 --> 00:15:08.984
You surpass me in power and
speed and everything.

00:15:09.084 --> 00:15:11.054
The only option
left for me is...

00:15:11.155 --> 00:15:13.492
(dramatic music)

00:15:15.631 --> 00:15:17.167
Why did she stop moving?

00:15:17.267 --> 00:15:19.237
She's aiming for a
counter-attack.

00:15:19.337 --> 00:15:22.376
That's why.
It's her only choice.

00:15:24.649 --> 00:15:26.986
(dramatic music)

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:32.029
[Annerose] Take that!

00:15:32.732 --> 00:15:34.434
<i>I got him!</i>

00:15:39.043 --> 00:15:41.115
<i>I thought I was matching
my attack to his,</i>

00:15:41.215 --> 00:15:43.152
<i>but he was matching
his attack to mine.</i>

00:15:43.252 --> 00:15:45.524
<i>Such perfect control
of his spacing...</i>

00:15:45.624 --> 00:15:48.162
<i>(ungh) It's so...</i>

00:15:51.068 --> 00:15:52.738
(music ends abruptly)

00:15:53.574 --> 00:15:55.710
(crowd cheering)

00:16:04.027 --> 00:16:05.096
[Iris] He's good.

00:16:05.196 --> 00:16:06.933
[Perv] Absolute confidence...

00:16:07.033 --> 00:16:09.304
Your instincts were spot on,
Your Highness.

00:16:09.404 --> 00:16:12.076
I could not have
predicted this outcome.

00:16:12.177 --> 00:16:15.149
I find it hard to believe that
a Dark Knight of his caliber

00:16:15.249 --> 00:16:17.353
has gone unnoticed for so long.

00:16:17.453 --> 00:16:19.725
[Perv] Mundane Mann...
I've never heard of him.

00:16:19.825 --> 00:16:23.265
His fencing style doesn't come
from an established school,
does it?

00:16:23.365 --> 00:16:26.739
I doubt it. I have never seen
anyone fight like that before.

00:16:26.839 --> 00:16:30.146
But his blade was certainly
swift, sure, and sharp.

00:16:30.246 --> 00:16:33.286
[Perv]
And most of all, it was
beautiful.

00:16:33.386 --> 00:16:34.621
Hmm...

00:16:34.722 --> 00:16:36.793
The next round will be you
against this Mundane, won't it?

00:16:36.893 --> 00:16:39.331
[Iris] It will.
[Perv]
Are you confident you'll win?

00:16:39.431 --> 00:16:42.738
I'm certainly no match for him
in beauty of swordplay,

00:16:42.838 --> 00:16:46.278
but it is not beauty that
determines the winner
of a duel.

00:16:46.378 --> 00:16:48.650
If that was the
full extent of his power,

00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:50.419
he hasn't reached my level yet.

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:51.623
I suspect not.

00:16:51.723 --> 00:16:54.161
There is a good chance
that he is hiding something.

00:16:54.261 --> 00:16:57.066
That's why he disguised his
stance and his technique,

00:16:57.166 --> 00:16:59.237
so that he could win his way
through the tournament.

00:16:59.337 --> 00:17:01.475
And you still believe
you can beat him?

00:17:01.576 --> 00:17:03.913
I don't know what it is
that he is hiding,

00:17:04.013 --> 00:17:06.184
but I will
cut him down regardless.

00:17:06.285 --> 00:17:08.757
I absolutely hate to lose,
after all.

00:17:08.857 --> 00:17:11.796
Now, if you'll excuse me.
I have a match to fight.

00:17:16.506 --> 00:17:17.808
Hmm...

00:17:23.686 --> 00:17:26.125
[Perv] Find out where
Mundane Mann came from.

00:17:26.225 --> 00:17:27.561
[aide] Yes, My Liege.

00:17:27.661 --> 00:17:31.334
I suspect he might be a
resident of the underworld.

00:17:31.435 --> 00:17:33.306
If the Lawless City
is backing him,

00:17:33.406 --> 00:17:35.075
things could get difficult.

00:17:35.175 --> 00:17:37.380
[aide] Is it possible he's
with Shadow Garden?

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:40.821
[Perv]
Unlikely, he's a man, after all.

00:17:40.921 --> 00:17:42.558
Besides, I doubt Shadow Garden

00:17:42.658 --> 00:17:46.098
has any reason to make a scene
at the Bushin Festival.

00:17:46.198 --> 00:17:48.302
[aide] Understood, excuse me.

00:17:49.672 --> 00:17:52.143
I will crush any
potential problems.

00:17:52.244 --> 00:17:54.414
Who is that man?

00:18:06.404 --> 00:18:08.275
[Annerose] Mundane, wait!

00:18:09.712 --> 00:18:11.081
I admit defeat.

00:18:11.181 --> 00:18:13.786
I was helpless against
your speed and skill.

00:18:13.887 --> 00:18:17.393
(chuckles) I left my home
country to make myself stronger,

00:18:17.493 --> 00:18:19.532
and I thought that I had
improved since then,

00:18:19.632 --> 00:18:23.305
but I guess I had only gotten
better in my head.

00:18:23.405 --> 00:18:26.244
This was a good lesson for me,
thank you.

00:18:26.344 --> 00:18:29.017
That was the first time I
removed my shackles.

00:18:29.117 --> 00:18:31.421
You have nothing
to be ashamed of.

00:18:32.658 --> 00:18:35.229
I am very happy to hear that.
(light piano music)

00:18:40.172 --> 00:18:41.943
Mundane!

00:18:42.043 --> 00:18:43.914
Who are you really?

00:18:44.014 --> 00:18:46.418
How did you get
to be so strong?

00:18:46.519 --> 00:18:49.057
I'm merely a fool
who abandoned everything

00:18:49.157 --> 00:18:50.927
in the pursuit of strength.

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:52.464
Hey, Mundane...

00:18:52.565 --> 00:18:54.267
[Skel]
Let go! Let me go, please!

00:18:54.367 --> 00:18:55.537
Listen, you could enlist
(Skel pleading)

00:18:55.637 --> 00:18:58.175
in government service
in Velgalta.

00:18:58.275 --> 00:19:00.213
I'll make sure there's
a post worthy of you.

00:19:00.313 --> 00:19:02.083
[Skel]
...I'll win the next one!

00:19:02.183 --> 00:19:03.853
That world's too bright for me.
(Skel pleading)

00:19:03.954 --> 00:19:06.191
[tough guy] Come on, kid, the
next match is Princess Iris!

00:19:06.291 --> 00:19:07.695
[Annerose] Wait!
[Skel] No, I don't wanna go!

00:19:07.795 --> 00:19:09.364
I'll be resuming
my journey tomorrow.
(Skel pleading)

00:19:09.464 --> 00:19:12.538
If you change your mind,
come see me before I go?

00:19:12.638 --> 00:19:14.675
It's thanks to you
that I was able to learn

00:19:14.775 --> 00:19:16.245
of even greater heights.

00:19:16.345 --> 00:19:17.548
[Skel] ...find me
in the next three days!

00:19:17.648 --> 00:19:19.918
For now, all I can do
is look up to them.

00:19:20.019 --> 00:19:22.891
[Annerose] But one day I will...
[Skel] Uno mas, por favor!

00:19:28.737 --> 00:19:30.874
(thunderous explosion)

00:19:31.776 --> 00:19:33.913
(rubble settling)

00:19:39.525 --> 00:19:41.962
[ref] The winner, Iris Midgar!

00:19:42.063 --> 00:19:44.400
(crowd cheering)

00:19:46.271 --> 00:19:48.609
(electrical discharge)

00:19:49.611 --> 00:19:52.283
What I need is a total victory!

00:19:53.118 --> 00:19:54.621
(gasps)

00:19:58.195 --> 00:19:59.698
Huh?

00:20:01.434 --> 00:20:03.773
(indistinct chattering)
(birds chirping)

00:20:10.486 --> 00:20:12.056
[Iris] Lady Beatrix!

00:20:12.156 --> 00:20:13.826
Lady Beatrix!

00:20:16.131 --> 00:20:17.535
(panting)

00:20:17.635 --> 00:20:20.205
I'm sorry to stop you.
If I'm not mistaken,

00:20:20.305 --> 00:20:22.210
you're Beatrix the War Goddess,
correct?

00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:23.211
Who are you?

00:20:23.311 --> 00:20:24.481
I am Iris,

00:20:24.582 --> 00:20:26.652
the Crown princess of
the Midgar Kingdom.

00:20:27.153 --> 00:20:28.856
Want one?

00:20:28.956 --> 00:20:30.092
Um, what?

00:20:30.192 --> 00:20:32.531
You'll feel better
if you eat something.

00:20:33.065 --> 00:20:34.969
No, thank you.

00:20:35.069 --> 00:20:37.607
That is very kind,
but I will pass.

00:20:38.576 --> 00:20:40.613
[Beatrix] Oh, all right.

00:20:42.518 --> 00:20:44.187
(whimsical music)

00:20:44.288 --> 00:20:46.224
[Kagenou]
<i>Man, that went so well!</i>

00:20:46.324 --> 00:20:48.262
<i>I got to show off my
stylish sword skills</i>

00:20:48.362 --> 00:20:50.232
<i>that I can't use as Shadow.</i>

00:20:50.332 --> 00:20:51.836
<i>And thanks to Miss Not-Seeing,</i>

00:20:51.936 --> 00:20:55.443
<i>I managed to accomplish 70% of
my Bushin Festival goals.</i>

00:20:55.544 --> 00:20:57.915
<i>Now I just need to figure out
how to finish it up.</i>

00:20:58.015 --> 00:21:00.620
<i>The simple solution would be
to win the whole thing,</i>

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:02.490
<i>but the most climactic scene
is gonna be</i>

00:21:02.591 --> 00:21:04.394
<i>the next battle with
Princess Iris.</i>

00:21:04.494 --> 00:21:06.665
<i>Defeat the princess and
then just disappear.</i>

00:21:06.766 --> 00:21:09.806
<i>Beat somebody that everybody
has identified as a
powerful warrior,</i>

00:21:09.906 --> 00:21:11.942
<i>and announce,
"My work here is done."</i>

00:21:12.042 --> 00:21:15.283
<i>And vanish without a trace like
a true Eminence in Shadow.</i>

00:21:15.383 --> 00:21:17.955
I love it.
I could also go the evil route.

00:21:18.055 --> 00:21:19.257
That would be exciting.

00:21:19.357 --> 00:21:20.827
[Kagenou]
<i>Out of the blue, I'll go,</i>

00:21:20.927 --> 00:21:23.031
<i>"I'm a shadow assassin from a
shadowy organization."</i>

00:21:23.131 --> 00:21:25.269
<i>"I've come from the shadows
to take your life!"</i>

00:21:25.369 --> 00:21:28.743
<i>And then we launch into
no holds barred
free-for-all battle.</i>

00:21:28.843 --> 00:21:32.316
I get bonus points,
exit stage right, easy peasy.

00:21:32.416 --> 00:21:34.354
There's still tons of
awesome paths to take,

00:21:34.454 --> 00:21:36.057
so I'm gonna have to
think long and hard.

00:21:36.157 --> 00:21:37.561
[Claire]
Well, someone looks happy.

00:21:37.661 --> 00:21:40.432
Well, I am happy.
Huh?

00:21:40.534 --> 00:21:44.909
Did you have this much fun when
you watched my match too?

00:21:45.009 --> 00:21:48.215
[Kagenou] <i>Oh, boy, I'm dead.</i>

00:21:48.316 --> 00:21:50.653
(wind whistling)

00:22:15.235 --> 00:22:17.974
Please, grant me...

00:22:21.214 --> 00:22:23.553
