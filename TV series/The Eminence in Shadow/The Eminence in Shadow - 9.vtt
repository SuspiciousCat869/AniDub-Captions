WEBVTT

00:00:01.236 --> 00:00:03.541
(tense driving music)

00:00:04.743 --> 00:00:06.212
They're just a few guns.

00:00:06.312 --> 00:00:08.283
Maybe we should put the soldiers
in the front of the groups.

00:00:08.384 --> 00:00:09.887
You wanna use them
as human shields?!

00:00:09.987 --> 00:00:12.659
Well, without our magic there's
no way we can hold them off!

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:15.932
[knights]
I think it will be difficult to
dispel it from the outside.

00:00:16.032 --> 00:00:17.836
All of our specialists are
being held captive

00:00:17.936 --> 00:00:19.405
INSIDE the academy.

00:00:19.506 --> 00:00:20.908
-We can't go through the woods.

00:00:21.008 --> 00:00:22.345
There's barbed wire everywhere.

00:00:22.445 --> 00:00:24.248
-I'm more concerned
about the tunnels.

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:25.751
If they've managed
to cut off access

00:00:25.851 --> 00:00:27.288
to the outside so thoroughly...

00:00:27.388 --> 00:00:28.991
-Do you think they have
a spy in the school?

00:00:29.092 --> 00:00:31.797
-You mean Zenon
wasn't the only one?

00:00:39.179 --> 00:00:40.548
[Rose]
They don't need to tie us up.

00:00:40.648 --> 00:00:43.286
Without our magic, there's
nothing we can really do.

00:00:46.259 --> 00:00:49.099
[Rose]
Even if we did have our magic...

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:51.536
(tense driving music)

00:00:58.685 --> 00:01:00.821
(tuning fork ringing)

00:01:03.126 --> 00:01:04.295
(gasps)

00:01:04.395 --> 00:01:06.733
(electrical discharge)

00:01:10.073 --> 00:01:11.576
(chime)

00:01:12.177 --> 00:01:13.915
We actually did it!

00:01:14.015 --> 00:01:15.150
Impressive.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.020
Oh my god, we really did it!

00:01:17.121 --> 00:01:18.657
Now I can control
the Eye of Avarice

00:01:18.757 --> 00:01:21.163
and stop it from
shutting off our magic!

00:01:21.263 --> 00:01:23.433
[Cid] So, what about
those hidden tunnels?

00:01:23.534 --> 00:01:26.606
[Sherry] Right! According to
what my father told me...

00:01:29.011 --> 00:01:30.080
(click)

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.852
(book shelf rumbling)

00:01:32.952 --> 00:01:34.556
[Cid] Woah...

00:01:34.656 --> 00:01:36.994
[Sherry] Now I can finally
go help my father!

00:01:37.094 --> 00:01:38.597
[Cid] That's great.

00:01:39.398 --> 00:01:41.435
[Kagenou] <i>I love this stuff!</i>

00:01:42.806 --> 00:01:45.143
(OPENING THEME)

00:03:21.804 --> 00:03:23.306
(sighs)

00:03:23.406 --> 00:03:25.745
(tense music)

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.788
(blood spraying)

00:03:33.861 --> 00:03:35.998
(tense music building)

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.820
Uh, Mommy?

00:03:47.688 --> 00:03:49.358
(raining)

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.299
[Lutheran] The world has
lost a great woman.

00:03:55.137 --> 00:03:56.673
You should know that
your mother was

00:03:56.773 --> 00:03:59.078
a very gifted researcher,
Sherry.

00:03:59.178 --> 00:04:00.280
But more than that,

00:04:00.381 --> 00:04:02.685
she was an exceptional
friend to me.

00:04:04.255 --> 00:04:07.528
If you'd like to,
you can come stay with me.

00:04:08.096 --> 00:04:09.599
(huh)

00:04:11.402 --> 00:04:13.472
[Sherry] Father gave me as much
love and affection

00:04:13.574 --> 00:04:15.778
as he would his
own flesh and blood.

00:04:15.878 --> 00:04:19.787
He even supported the research
my mother left behind.

00:04:19.887 --> 00:04:22.758
So now, it's my turn.

00:04:25.197 --> 00:04:26.867
Don't worry, he'll be okay.

00:04:26.967 --> 00:04:29.907
Thank you, Cid.
Thank you for everything.

00:04:30.007 --> 00:04:33.146
I only helped out a little,
it was no big deal.

00:04:33.246 --> 00:04:35.217
There's nothing left
for me to do here.

00:04:35.317 --> 00:04:37.955
It's all up to you now.
Go save the world.

00:04:38.056 --> 00:04:39.726
Okay, I'll try.

00:04:52.251 --> 00:04:54.957
Where is he? (coughs)

00:04:55.057 --> 00:04:56.893
What is taking Rex so long?

00:04:56.994 --> 00:05:00.534
[cultist] Sir, we have not seen
him or any of the guards.

00:05:01.135 --> 00:05:02.872
[guy] Rose!

00:05:02.972 --> 00:05:04.374
Forget it. As we are now,

00:05:04.474 --> 00:05:07.281
we can't even block bullets,
let alone swords.

00:05:07.381 --> 00:05:09.285
The dense magical energy
emanating from him

00:05:09.385 --> 00:05:10.788
is in a whole other league.

00:05:10.888 --> 00:05:12.190
I don't know
if we could beat him,

00:05:12.291 --> 00:05:14.061
even if we did have
our magic back.

00:05:14.161 --> 00:05:16.299
But we can't just sit here!

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:17.300
I know that!

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.104
(gun bang)

00:05:19.205 --> 00:05:20.474
(bats squeaking)

00:05:20.575 --> 00:05:22.778
(Sherry squealing)

00:05:28.857 --> 00:05:30.527
I have to try.

00:05:31.429 --> 00:05:33.499
(gun bangs)
(student groans)

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:37.007
Yo, bull's eye number two!

00:05:37.108 --> 00:05:40.681
They're pathetic letting these
commoners' toys take 'm out.

00:05:40.781 --> 00:05:43.319
They're a disgrace to
the name of Dark Knight!

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:45.390
[students] Rose, please!
-We have to do something!

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:47.060
We can't!

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.564
-They're going to kill us all!

00:05:48.664 --> 00:05:50.601
-This is humiliating!

00:05:52.071 --> 00:05:54.408
(Gaunt chuckles)

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:56.846
(tense music)

00:05:59.953 --> 00:06:01.823
(Sherry gasps)

00:06:01.924 --> 00:06:03.794
(gun bangs)
(student gasps in pain)

00:06:03.894 --> 00:06:05.430
(gasps)

00:06:05.531 --> 00:06:07.835
(faint heartbeat)

00:06:10.207 --> 00:06:11.710
[Sherry] That's...

00:06:17.154 --> 00:06:19.491
(artifact whirring)

00:06:21.061 --> 00:06:22.799
Don't worry, Father.

00:06:22.899 --> 00:06:24.569
I'm coming!

00:06:25.605 --> 00:06:27.942
(artifact shimmering)

00:06:29.277 --> 00:06:32.050
[Rose] Huh? What is that light?

00:06:34.021 --> 00:06:35.858
(sharp ringing)

00:06:37.261 --> 00:06:39.599
(dramatic music)

00:06:40.534 --> 00:06:42.170
What happened?

00:06:43.339 --> 00:06:45.143
Ms. President!

00:06:45.244 --> 00:06:47.480
(blood squelching)
(soldier groaning)

00:06:49.686 --> 00:06:52.257
Our magic has been unsealed!

00:06:52.357 --> 00:06:54.461
It's time to fight back!

00:06:54.562 --> 00:06:57.100
(students shouting)

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.235
[students] Take their swords!

00:06:58.336 --> 00:06:59.506
-Surround them!

00:06:59.606 --> 00:07:01.175
-Secure an escape route!
[cultist] Dammit!

00:07:01.275 --> 00:07:03.680
[Gaunt] What are you doing?

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:07.254
Kill them.
[cultist] Yes, sir!

00:07:07.354 --> 00:07:08.356
[students] Reinforcements!

00:07:08.456 --> 00:07:09.760
-They're stong!
-Outnumber them!

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:11.563
-Younger students,
get us some swords!

00:07:11.663 --> 00:07:13.232
Even just training swords!

00:07:13.332 --> 00:07:15.805
-Science students evacuate! Now!

00:07:15.905 --> 00:07:18.476
(swords clashing)
(general commotion)

00:07:21.082 --> 00:07:23.720
We haven't gotten back all the
magic they took from us yet.

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:27.160
Before I run out completely,
I have to get HIM!

00:07:29.098 --> 00:07:31.235
(swords clanging)

00:07:33.239 --> 00:07:35.878
<i>Is this the end?
No.</i>

00:07:35.978 --> 00:07:40.220
<i>Even if they take me down,
the rest of them will carry on.</i>

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:44.929
<i>Just like I'm carrying on
the legacy of his love for me!</i>

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:46.600
(sword slicing)

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:48.103
(blood splatters)

00:07:48.203 --> 00:07:49.137
(thud)

00:07:49.238 --> 00:07:50.774
<i>What was that?</i>

00:07:52.578 --> 00:07:53.480
(smiles)

00:07:53.581 --> 00:07:55.918
(soldiers yelling)

00:07:57.555 --> 00:07:59.592
(glass shattering)

00:08:02.364 --> 00:08:04.702
(driving techno music)

00:08:05.972 --> 00:08:06.940
Very well done.

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:09.846
So now what,
my beautiful sword wielder?

00:08:15.356 --> 00:08:17.695
(soldiers fighting and dying)

00:08:23.472 --> 00:08:25.677
What the hell is all this?

00:08:27.815 --> 00:08:30.320
We are Shadow Garden.
(soaring choral music)

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:32.157
[all] We lurk in the shadows,

00:08:32.257 --> 00:08:34.662
and we hunt the shadows.

00:08:41.643 --> 00:08:43.980
(swords clashing)

00:08:46.586 --> 00:08:48.924
(blood splattering)

00:08:55.772 --> 00:08:58.042
This is our chance!
Leave the auditorium!

00:08:58.142 --> 00:08:59.078
Carry the injured!

00:08:59.178 --> 00:09:01.181
[guy] Yes, ma'am! Hurry!

00:09:02.552 --> 00:09:03.788
(swords clang)

00:09:03.888 --> 00:09:06.225
(fighting and running)

00:09:08.396 --> 00:09:09.600
[Sherry] Where's my Father?

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:11.770
I don't see him anywhere.
(light hissing)

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:16.613
Huh...

00:09:17.582 --> 00:09:19.484
(fire roaring)

00:09:19.585 --> 00:09:21.288
[guy] Fire! And it's spreading!

00:09:21.388 --> 00:09:22.491
Ms. President!

00:09:22.592 --> 00:09:23.927
Use sword pressure
to open a path!

00:09:24.027 --> 00:09:25.931
Just get everyone out of here!

00:09:28.035 --> 00:09:30.273
[Gamma] They did this
in their own territory?

00:09:30.373 --> 00:09:31.977
An extremely bold move.

00:09:32.077 --> 00:09:32.979
Lady Gamma...

00:09:33.079 --> 00:09:34.749
Hmm?

00:09:34.849 --> 00:09:37.220
Oh, dear, what a disaster.

00:09:38.758 --> 00:09:41.094
(dramatic music)

00:10:01.736 --> 00:10:04.040
(fire roaring)

00:10:05.109 --> 00:10:06.412
[Iris]
What is going on in there?!

00:10:06.513 --> 00:10:07.548
[knights] We don't know!

00:10:07.648 --> 00:10:08.684
One second,
we had our magic back,

00:10:08.784 --> 00:10:10.153
the next everything
was on fire!

00:10:10.253 --> 00:10:12.257
-And there are bodies of dead
intruders everywhere!

00:10:12.357 --> 00:10:15.263
Okay then, just do your best
to put out the fires.

00:10:15.363 --> 00:10:16.700
(coughing and moaning)

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:19.304
<i>The students that were
being held hostage...</i>

00:10:20.373 --> 00:10:21.876
[Iris] Princess Rose!

00:10:23.246 --> 00:10:24.682
[Rose] Princess Iris...

00:10:24.782 --> 00:10:26.085
Our magic suddenly came back,

00:10:26.185 --> 00:10:28.691
and then these fires
broke out verywhere.

00:10:28.791 --> 00:10:30.293
What happened in there?

00:10:30.393 --> 00:10:33.934
A mystery organization appeared
and wiped out the terrorists.

00:10:34.035 --> 00:10:36.038
They called themselves
Shadow Garden.

00:10:36.138 --> 00:10:37.174
(gasps)

00:10:37.274 --> 00:10:39.645
[Iris] And you're sure
that's what they said?

00:10:39.745 --> 00:10:43.118
[Rose] Yes, but the terrorists
went by the same name.

00:10:44.354 --> 00:10:45.858
Who are they?

00:10:47.928 --> 00:10:50.400
[Nu] We have retrieved all
of the necessary articles.

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:52.170
Very well done, Nu.

00:10:53.406 --> 00:10:54.709
All that's left...

00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:57.146
(fire exploding)

00:10:58.383 --> 00:11:00.220
He wasn't in the auditorium!

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:01.689
Father, where are you?

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:03.125
(loud explosion)

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:13.412
(light clicks)

00:11:15.183 --> 00:11:17.320
(fire roaring)

00:11:21.897 --> 00:11:24.200
[Cid] What are you doing
in that costume...

00:11:26.706 --> 00:11:29.712
Assistant Principal,
Lutheran Barnett?

00:11:30.547 --> 00:11:32.885
Cid Kagenou...

00:11:36.593 --> 00:11:39.031
How the hell did
you figure it out?

00:11:39.131 --> 00:11:41.135
[Cid]
One look and it was obvious.

00:11:41.235 --> 00:11:42.204
[Lutheran] I see.

00:11:42.304 --> 00:11:45.511
Was it the way I walk,
or the way I stand?

00:11:45.611 --> 00:11:48.015
You have a good eye.

00:11:48.115 --> 00:11:51.790
Can I ask you something,
just for my own reference?

00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:53.527
[Lutheran] What is it?

00:11:53.627 --> 00:11:55.130
[Cid] Why are you doing this?

00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:58.168
You didn't seem the type to be
into this sort of thing.

00:11:59.004 --> 00:12:01.375
[Lutheran]
You really want to know?

00:12:01.475 --> 00:12:02.778
At one point in my life,

00:12:02.878 --> 00:12:05.551
I had reached the top of the
sword fighting world.

00:12:05.651 --> 00:12:08.323
That was before you were born.

00:12:08.423 --> 00:12:11.428
[Cid] Right, I heard you
won the Bushin Festival.

00:12:11.529 --> 00:12:14.836
(laughs) The Bushin Festival...

00:12:14.936 --> 00:12:18.275
The real peak is
much higher than that.

00:12:18.375 --> 00:12:21.048
Although, I doubt you would
understand any of that.

00:12:22.818 --> 00:12:24.589
But as soon as I
made it to the top

00:12:24.689 --> 00:12:26.292
of the sword fighting
world I got sick.

00:12:26.392 --> 00:12:29.431
The glory I'd fought so hard
to attain was gone.

00:12:29.532 --> 00:12:31.335
Just like that.
After that,

00:12:31.435 --> 00:12:33.941
I went in search of
a way to cure my disease,

00:12:34.041 --> 00:12:37.114
and I found potential in
a certain artifact.

00:12:37.214 --> 00:12:39.351
Is this story going
to get long?

00:12:39.451 --> 00:12:40.587
[Lutheran] A little.

00:12:40.687 --> 00:12:42.925
There was a researcher,
Sherry's mother,

00:12:43.025 --> 00:12:45.964
an unlucky woman who was
despised by the academic world

00:12:46.064 --> 00:12:47.568
for being too intelligent.

00:12:47.668 --> 00:12:51.609
I funded her research and she
immersed herself in it.

00:12:51.709 --> 00:12:54.047
We got along beautifully.

00:12:54.147 --> 00:12:57.354
Then I finally came face to
face with the artifact

00:12:57.454 --> 00:12:59.491
I had so longed to find,

00:12:59.592 --> 00:13:02.029
but that idiotic woman said

00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:04.736
the Eye of Avarice
was too dangerous.

00:13:04.836 --> 00:13:08.008
Of all things,
she suggested handing it over

00:13:08.108 --> 00:13:10.547
to the government
for safekeeping.

00:13:12.518 --> 00:13:16.091
I tore her apart,
starting with her extremities,

00:13:16.192 --> 00:13:19.063
working my way inward,
until finally,

00:13:19.164 --> 00:13:22.871
I stabbed her through the heart
and gave it a good twist.

00:13:28.015 --> 00:13:30.219
(Lutheran laughing)

00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:33.359
Sherry never knew.

00:13:33.459 --> 00:13:34.762
She never doubted.

00:13:34.862 --> 00:13:37.066
She just took over
her mother's research,

00:13:37.166 --> 00:13:40.874
never realizing that I
was her mother's killer.

00:13:40.974 --> 00:13:44.447
My dear, sweet, foolish girl.

00:13:45.885 --> 00:13:48.790
[Lutheran] Well, does that
answer your question?

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:50.026
[Cid] Yeah, pretty much.

00:13:50.126 --> 00:13:51.930
There's just one thing
that bothers me.

00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:53.633
[Lutheran] And what is that?

00:13:53.733 --> 00:13:57.641
[Cid]
Is it true that you used Sherry
for your own selfish needs?

00:13:57.742 --> 00:14:01.516
[Lutheran]
Yes, of course it's true.
Does that anger you?

00:14:01.616 --> 00:14:03.152
Honestly, I'm not sure.

00:14:03.252 --> 00:14:06.191
I make a very clear distinction
between what's important to me

00:14:06.291 --> 00:14:08.462
and what's of no consequence.

00:14:08.563 --> 00:14:09.866
As people go through life,

00:14:09.966 --> 00:14:12.204
they collect more things that
have value to them.

00:14:12.304 --> 00:14:16.011
They make friends, find
significant others, get jobs.

00:14:16.546 --> 00:14:17.748
But me,

00:14:17.848 --> 00:14:20.687
I trimmed the fat,
and when I was done,

00:14:20.788 --> 00:14:24.829
all I had left was what I
absolutely couldn't do without.

00:14:24.929 --> 00:14:26.766
And that's why I don't
particularly care

00:14:26.866 --> 00:14:29.003
what happens to anything else.

00:14:29.906 --> 00:14:31.742
You mean you don't care
what becomes

00:14:31.843 --> 00:14:34.180
of the foolish mother
and daughter?

00:14:35.817 --> 00:14:37.955
[Cid] I think it's time
we got started.

00:14:38.055 --> 00:14:40.627
If we wait too long,
we may get interrupted.

00:14:40.727 --> 00:14:42.397
[Lutheran] Indeed. It's a pity,

00:14:42.497 --> 00:14:45.537
but I'm afraid it's time
for us to say goodbye.

00:14:48.644 --> 00:14:50.981
(loud thundering)

00:14:58.931 --> 00:15:02.203
I bid you farewell,
Cid Kagenou.

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:05.510
[Shadow] Where are you going?

00:15:06.012 --> 00:15:07.514
What the hell?!

00:15:08.049 --> 00:15:10.053
You! Shadow!

00:15:10.153 --> 00:15:13.627
(driving techno music)

00:15:13.727 --> 00:15:16.666
[Lutheran] Like you, I am a man
who has lived by the sword.

00:15:16.767 --> 00:15:20.173
I can tell a lot when I come
face to face with an opponent.

00:15:20.273 --> 00:15:21.843
Including the fact that I am

00:15:21.943 --> 00:15:24.214
currently at a disadvantage.

00:15:24.314 --> 00:15:26.953
My apologies,
but I'm not wasting any time

00:15:27.053 --> 00:15:28.757
before I pull out
all the stops.

00:15:28.857 --> 00:15:32.396
It is when you combine the Eye
of Avarice with its control unit

00:15:32.497 --> 00:15:34.835
that it demonstrates
its true value!

00:15:34.936 --> 00:15:36.539
Let me show you!

00:15:36.639 --> 00:15:38.977
(Lutheran groaning)

00:15:40.914 --> 00:15:44.588
Now is the moment of
my long awaited rebirth!

00:15:45.857 --> 00:15:48.195
(Lutheran groaning)

00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:50.868
It's glorious, isn't it?

00:15:50.968 --> 00:15:53.205
Truly magnificent!

00:15:53.305 --> 00:15:55.510
My strength is returning!

00:15:55.610 --> 00:15:57.948
My malady is being cured!

00:15:58.049 --> 00:15:59.284
Can you feel it?

00:15:59.384 --> 00:16:02.056
Can you feel the
magical energy running wild?

00:16:02.156 --> 00:16:05.196
The power far beyond
any human abilities!

00:16:05.296 --> 00:16:06.833
I think I'll try it on you.

00:16:06.933 --> 00:16:09.204
You'll be my first experiment!

00:16:10.205 --> 00:16:13.079
Nice block! Now how about this?

00:16:13.179 --> 00:16:15.517
(swords clashing)

00:16:16.719 --> 00:16:18.088
(Lutheran chuckles)

00:16:18.188 --> 00:16:20.426
I'll admit,
you are very strong indeed,

00:16:20.527 --> 00:16:23.265
and to show my respect
for your strength,

00:16:23.365 --> 00:16:25.704
I won't hold
anything back either!

00:16:25.804 --> 00:16:28.577
You have compelled me
to fight you as an equal.

00:16:28.677 --> 00:16:32.250
That will be something to brag
about in the afterlife!

00:16:36.258 --> 00:16:38.262
(Lutheran groans)

00:16:38.362 --> 00:16:41.234
[Shadow] So that's really
the best you can do?

00:16:47.013 --> 00:16:49.183
No! Not yet!

00:16:50.554 --> 00:16:52.992
It's impossible that
you can be this good!

00:16:53.092 --> 00:16:55.163
But it doesn't matter
how strong you are,

00:16:55.263 --> 00:16:56.465
it's over for you!

00:16:56.566 --> 00:16:58.403
I've made arrangements
to ensure

00:16:58.504 --> 00:17:00.406
you take the blame for
all that's happened!

00:17:00.507 --> 00:17:03.847
I've prepared evidence, witness
testimonies, everything!

00:17:03.947 --> 00:17:05.584
Now you'll be
branded as traitors,

00:17:05.684 --> 00:17:08.188
and the entire world will
be hunting you down!

00:17:08.288 --> 00:17:11.261
No amount of strength
will save you now!

00:17:11.361 --> 00:17:13.165
(sighs) That's hilarious.

00:17:13.266 --> 00:17:14.502
What the hell?!

00:17:14.602 --> 00:17:16.038
[Shadow] You think
a little thing like that

00:17:16.138 --> 00:17:17.373
means it's over for us?

00:17:17.473 --> 00:17:19.545
You are truly quite hysterical.

00:17:19.645 --> 00:17:23.286
My organization was never
walking the path of
righteousness,

00:17:23.386 --> 00:17:25.256
but we are not evil either.

00:17:25.356 --> 00:17:27.895
We walk the path
we make ourselves.

00:17:27.995 --> 00:17:29.766
If you can do that,
then go ahead.

00:17:29.866 --> 00:17:33.205
Bring me the guilt for all the
crimes in all the world.

00:17:33.305 --> 00:17:35.109
I will gladly accept all of it,

00:17:35.209 --> 00:17:37.013
but it won't change anything.

00:17:37.113 --> 00:17:38.382
Even with it, I...

00:17:38.482 --> 00:17:41.488
WE will do what we must do
without hesitation.

00:17:41.589 --> 00:17:42.891
[Lutheran]
Then you're not afraid

00:17:42.992 --> 00:17:45.329
to turn the entire
world against you?

00:17:46.365 --> 00:17:48.737
That is what we call hubris,
Shadow!

00:17:48.837 --> 00:17:49.738
(music stops suddenly)

00:17:49.839 --> 00:17:51.008
(sword slicing)

00:17:51.108 --> 00:17:53.445
(dramatic music resumes)

00:17:54.214 --> 00:17:56.552
(Lutheran groans)

00:18:03.131 --> 00:18:06.271
[Shadow]
You tore her apart from the
extremities to her core,

00:18:06.371 --> 00:18:09.143
and ended with her heart,
is that right?

00:18:12.283 --> 00:18:15.123
(sword slashes)
(blood splatters)

00:18:15.223 --> 00:18:17.426
(gasping and groaning)

00:18:19.765 --> 00:18:22.303
(artifact exploding)

00:18:22.403 --> 00:18:24.708
(Lutheran yelling)

00:18:27.648 --> 00:18:29.150
You...

00:18:30.319 --> 00:18:32.859
(Lutheran chuckles weakly)

00:18:32.959 --> 00:18:34.460
(thud)

00:18:51.395 --> 00:18:52.898
[Sherry] Father...

00:18:54.569 --> 00:18:56.672
(whimpering)

00:18:59.912 --> 00:19:02.350
No, Father!

00:19:02.852 --> 00:19:05.089
(Sherry crying)

00:19:05.189 --> 00:19:07.493
Please, Father, no!

00:19:07.594 --> 00:19:08.663
No! Why?

00:19:08.763 --> 00:19:09.898
Please, don't die!

00:19:09.999 --> 00:19:12.671
Father! Father!

00:19:12.772 --> 00:19:14.908
(Sherry crying)

00:19:18.517 --> 00:19:20.720
[Kagenou]
<i>You're better off not knowing.</i>

00:19:20.821 --> 00:19:22.924
Oh, Father, why?

00:19:23.526 --> 00:19:25.195
No!

00:19:34.214 --> 00:19:36.986
[Alpha] Don't you think it
turned out nicely?

00:19:37.087 --> 00:19:39.257
"Shadow,
sworn enemy to the kingdom."

00:19:39.358 --> 00:19:41.127
"Wanted for mass murder,
kidnapping,

00:19:41.227 --> 00:19:42.798
arson and armed robbery."

00:19:42.898 --> 00:19:44.935
What a nefarious, evil man.

00:19:45.035 --> 00:19:46.606
Our almighty, Lord Shadow said,

00:19:46.706 --> 00:19:49.411
"I will gladly accept the guilt
for all the crimes
in the world,

00:19:49.512 --> 00:19:51.414
but it won't change anything."

00:19:51.515 --> 00:19:52.885
[Alpha] Even with that guilt...

00:19:52.985 --> 00:19:56.659
[all] "We will do what we must
do without hesitation."

00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:00.767
[Alpha] Wise words.

00:20:01.335 --> 00:20:02.571
[Gamma] Indeed.

00:20:02.671 --> 00:20:04.307
I had originally
thought we stood

00:20:04.407 --> 00:20:06.144
for righteousness and justice,

00:20:06.244 --> 00:20:08.816
but that's not how
he saw it I suppose.

00:20:08.916 --> 00:20:12.356
We must do our part
to live up to his resolve.

00:20:12.456 --> 00:20:15.563
Assemble those available
of the Seven Shadows.

00:20:19.237 --> 00:20:22.577
So they're going to close the
school and start summer break?

00:20:28.856 --> 00:20:32.196
[Sherry] Um... Thank you for
your help the other day.

00:20:32.296 --> 00:20:33.600
[Cid] I didn't really do much.

00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:35.904
[Sherry] You did!
If you hadn't helped me,

00:20:36.004 --> 00:20:38.108
I never could have... have...

00:20:38.208 --> 00:20:41.014
[Cid]
It was nothing; forget about it.

00:20:41.114 --> 00:20:43.418
[Sherry]
I have something to tell you.

00:20:43.519 --> 00:20:46.492
I have decided that I'm
going to study abroad.

00:20:46.593 --> 00:20:48.128
I'm moving to Laugus.

00:20:48.228 --> 00:20:50.365
The city on the
leading edge of science?

00:20:50.466 --> 00:20:51.969
That's awesome.

00:20:52.069 --> 00:20:53.472
There's something I need to do,

00:20:53.573 --> 00:20:56.846
and I can't do it with only the
knowledge I possess now.

00:20:56.946 --> 00:20:58.650
Besides...

00:20:58.750 --> 00:21:02.190
I have no reason to stay in
this place anymore.

00:21:02.290 --> 00:21:03.191
[Cid] Okay.

00:21:03.292 --> 00:21:04.360
Well, good luck.

00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:05.964
[Sherry] Thank you.

00:21:07.033 --> 00:21:08.569
I do wish that I could have

00:21:08.669 --> 00:21:10.574
gotten to know you
a little better, Cid.

00:21:10.674 --> 00:21:13.345
[Cid] Yeah, maybe next time.

00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:17.052
[Sherry] Yes, maybe next time.

00:21:20.761 --> 00:21:22.564
Oh, one sec.

00:21:23.165 --> 00:21:24.500
Yes?

00:21:25.269 --> 00:21:26.438
[Cid] Mind if I ask you

00:21:26.539 --> 00:21:28.643
what it is you need to do?

00:21:29.411 --> 00:21:31.749
(soaring music)

00:21:42.436 --> 00:21:44.073
It's a secret.

00:21:45.242 --> 00:21:47.079
[Cid] Secret?

00:21:47.179 --> 00:21:48.784
[Sherry] Yes.

00:21:48.884 --> 00:21:51.020
Well, until next time.

00:21:51.889 --> 00:21:53.024
[Cid] Yeah.

00:21:59.303 --> 00:22:00.807
I...

00:22:01.843 --> 00:22:03.512
I swear, I'll...

00:22:06.418 --> 00:22:08.756
(chariot rattling)

00:22:21.181 --> 00:22:23.519
