00:00:01.069 --> 00:00:03.373
(birds chirping)

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.047
(people talking indistinctly)

00:00:14.362 --> 00:00:15.665
(sighs)

00:00:33.534 --> 00:00:35.838
He must have meant it as a
present for you.
(voice echoing)

00:00:35.939 --> 00:00:37.074
Don't you think?

00:00:37.174 --> 00:00:39.245
It's what we call
"love at first sight."

00:00:39.345 --> 00:00:43.119
I'm sure he's waiting for you
to respond in some way.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.770
(mmm...)

00:00:54.108 --> 00:00:55.611
(sighs)

00:00:56.781 --> 00:00:58.349
Mmm...

00:00:59.619 --> 00:01:01.455
So sweet.

00:01:02.793 --> 00:01:05.130
(OPENING THEME)

00:02:36.146 --> 00:02:38.483
(bells ringing)

00:02:39.886 --> 00:02:42.224
(indistinct chatter)

00:02:48.002 --> 00:02:49.506
Hey, Nu.

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.843
Hello, sir.

00:02:52.946 --> 00:02:54.315
You're going to school here?

00:02:54.415 --> 00:02:56.319
No, I borrowed these clothes.

00:02:56.419 --> 00:02:59.292
I'll attract less attention
in a uniform.

00:02:59.392 --> 00:03:00.895
[Cid] Makes sense.

00:03:03.399 --> 00:03:06.306
About the man in black we
apprehended last night,

00:03:06.406 --> 00:03:08.009
just as we had expected,

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:10.648
brainwashing
destroyed his mind.

00:03:10.748 --> 00:03:12.184
Uh-huh...

00:03:12.284 --> 00:03:14.789
It's a common trait of
the Cult of Diablos,

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:18.196
of their vanguard that they
call the Third Children.

00:03:18.296 --> 00:03:21.268
Unfortunately,
no matter what I tried to do,

00:03:21.368 --> 00:03:24.242
it was impossible to get any
more information.

00:03:24.342 --> 00:03:25.778
Oh, yeah...

00:03:26.713 --> 00:03:28.216
[Nu]
His costume was routed through

00:03:28.316 --> 00:03:29.753
lawless distribution channels,

00:03:29.853 --> 00:03:31.422
so we couldn't trace it.

00:03:31.523 --> 00:03:33.326
[Skel] I already made
sure to enter you!

00:03:33.427 --> 00:03:35.129
You are welcome!

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.904
You are ever so
very, very welcome!

00:03:39.004 --> 00:03:41.342
(indistinct chatter)

00:03:42.277 --> 00:03:43.781
We wanted to enter too,

00:03:43.881 --> 00:03:47.420
but that's not exactly possible
with these injuries, you know?

00:03:48.891 --> 00:03:49.960
Yeah, I won't do it.

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:51.228
Why in the hell not?!

00:03:51.328 --> 00:03:52.532
If you fight in the tournament,

00:03:52.632 --> 00:03:54.703
then you can easily get
two or three girls.

00:03:54.803 --> 00:03:57.341
(Skel gasping)

00:03:57.441 --> 00:03:59.580
If you attract too many,
you can send some of them our-

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:00.548
(Po gasping)

00:04:00.649 --> 00:04:02.719
F-for some reason
my stomach hurts.

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:05.624
Yeah,
m-my stomach is hurting too.

00:04:07.294 --> 00:04:08.496
(sighs)

00:04:08.597 --> 00:04:10.601
[Nu] They take orphans
with magical aptitude

00:04:10.701 --> 00:04:12.204
and children of poor families

00:04:12.305 --> 00:04:14.308
and administer drugs
and brainwashing

00:04:14.408 --> 00:04:17.314
to create the
Children of Diablos.

00:04:17.414 --> 00:04:20.688
The cult has been doing this
for a great many years.

00:04:20.788 --> 00:04:22.825
[Cid] Huh...

00:04:22.925 --> 00:04:24.195
I suspect the cult's goal

00:04:24.295 --> 00:04:26.298
is to use the name
of Shadow Garden

00:04:26.399 --> 00:04:28.838
to lure us out of
our hiding place.

00:04:28.938 --> 00:04:30.006
Ah...

00:04:30.106 --> 00:04:32.078
I so don't need this right now.

00:04:32.178 --> 00:04:34.215
I'm simply not gonna do it.

00:04:34.315 --> 00:04:36.252
I understand, my Lord.

00:04:36.352 --> 00:04:39.058
However, I feel I should
also inform you

00:04:39.158 --> 00:04:40.829
that we just found
a named First Child

00:04:40.929 --> 00:04:42.565
in the Royal Capital.

00:04:42.665 --> 00:04:46.105
He's named Rex,
the Game of Betrayal.

00:04:46.205 --> 00:04:47.576
(orchestral music)

00:04:47.676 --> 00:04:48.911
Named?

00:04:49.011 --> 00:04:50.247
[Nu] Yes.

00:04:50.347 --> 00:04:52.051
A First Child is someone who

00:04:52.151 --> 00:04:54.823
has maintained his
sense of self.

00:04:54.923 --> 00:04:57.963
And if they're deploying named
Children to the Royal Capital,

00:04:58.063 --> 00:05:01.603
it's clear they have some
other purpose in mind.

00:05:02.438 --> 00:05:03.641
Yes, of course.

00:05:03.741 --> 00:05:07.414
If I'm considering the
fundamental objective,

00:05:07.515 --> 00:05:09.418
I may not be the one
who set the stage,

00:05:09.519 --> 00:05:12.258
but there are ways for
me to deal with this.

00:05:12.358 --> 00:05:14.161
[Nu] Lord Shadow?

00:05:14.261 --> 00:05:16.199
The perfect opportunity...

00:05:16.299 --> 00:05:19.071
Nevertheless,
it will require some thinking.

00:05:20.608 --> 00:05:22.477
See you later, Nu.

00:05:23.413 --> 00:05:25.183
[Kagenou]
<i>I have 24 at the moment.</i>

00:05:25.283 --> 00:05:27.354
<i>I'll want at least twice that.</i>

00:05:27.455 --> 00:05:28.891
[Nu]
<i>In every single circumstance,</i>

00:05:28.991 --> 00:05:31.997
<i>he always leads us straight
to the best solution.</i>

00:05:32.097 --> 00:05:35.672
<i>No, he's had the answer
from the start.</i>

00:05:35.772 --> 00:05:38.911
The Wisdom of the Shadows...

00:05:42.518 --> 00:05:45.625
(indistinct chatter)

00:05:45.725 --> 00:05:49.633
[Nu] <i>Life at school, the life
I would be living if...</i>

00:05:49.733 --> 00:05:51.335
(lively classical music)

00:05:51.435 --> 00:05:53.472
(laughing)

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.013
(off-tune music)

00:05:57.113 --> 00:05:59.451
(Nu gasping and screaming)

00:06:00.888 --> 00:06:02.290
[Nu] But...

00:06:02.391 --> 00:06:03.928
I would much rather
have it this way

00:06:04.028 --> 00:06:07.167
than live my life
never knowing the truth.

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:16.886
(crowd cheering)

00:06:17.589 --> 00:06:19.626
(minor explosion)

00:06:23.466 --> 00:06:25.771
Winner, Claire Kagenou.

00:06:25.872 --> 00:06:28.009
(crowd cheering)

00:06:29.345 --> 00:06:30.848
[spectators]
I knew Claire could do it.

00:06:30.948 --> 00:06:33.386
-I can see why Princess Iris
has her eye on HER.

00:06:33.486 --> 00:06:36.459
-How do you think she'll do
against Student Council
President Rose?

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.864
-If only Princess Alexia
weren't injured!

00:06:38.964 --> 00:06:40.266
Step up!

00:06:40.366 --> 00:06:43.439
If you're not willing to risk
it, what good are you as a man?

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:44.943
In the six matches so far,
(students clamoring)

00:06:45.043 --> 00:06:47.849
we've had favorites, long
shots, anything goes!

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:50.721
You're not going to be placing
a bet on this one, Skel?

00:06:50.821 --> 00:06:52.659
No, I went and put
everything I had

00:06:52.759 --> 00:06:54.494
on the sure winner
of the first match.

00:06:54.595 --> 00:06:57.201
That was a very unfortunate
upset, wasn't it?

00:06:57.301 --> 00:06:59.105
I'll be eating nothing
but stale bread

00:06:59.205 --> 00:07:00.541
until the end of the month.

00:07:00.641 --> 00:07:02.879
If you go with the potatoes,
they're very versatile.

00:07:02.979 --> 00:07:04.649
[bookie] All right,
our next match is one

00:07:04.749 --> 00:07:06.085
you'll really wanna watch!

00:07:06.185 --> 00:07:08.690
This match will be fought
by the fierce, unstoppable

00:07:08.791 --> 00:07:11.630
Student Body President,
Rose Oriana!

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:13.667
And she'll be up against...
(crowd cheering)

00:07:13.767 --> 00:07:16.038
[Po] Come to think of it,
how is Cid doing?

00:07:16.138 --> 00:07:18.577
[Skel] What? He's actually
gonna go through with it?

00:07:18.677 --> 00:07:20.782
[Po]
That's a little harsh, Skel.

00:07:20.882 --> 00:07:22.619
[spectators]
President Rose, you can do it!

00:07:22.719 --> 00:07:23.987
-Who is that guy?

00:07:24.087 --> 00:07:25.023
-No idea.

00:07:25.123 --> 00:07:26.458
-He's kind of plain looking.

00:07:26.559 --> 00:07:28.931
[Kagenou] <i>Student Council

00:10:13.459 --> 00:10:14.663
(ungh)
(blood squelching)

00:10:14.763 --> 00:10:16.165
[Rose] I've smashed you
over a dozen times

00:10:16.265 --> 00:10:19.037
and I permeated every one of
those attacks with magic.

00:10:19.137 --> 00:10:22.010
And yet you refuse to let this
battle come to an end.

00:10:22.111 --> 00:10:24.314
That's what you're saying,
isn't it?

00:10:26.418 --> 00:10:27.989
I owe you an apology

00:10:28.089 --> 00:10:31.162
for underestimating you at
the beginning of this match,

00:10:31.262 --> 00:10:33.433
and that is why...

00:10:33.534 --> 00:10:35.771
I will end it with this NOW!

00:10:35.871 --> 00:10:37.942
[ref] That's enough!
[Cid] Ungh!

00:10:38.644 --> 00:10:40.246
(thuds)

00:10:40.346 --> 00:10:41.583
(gasps)

00:10:41.683 --> 00:10:43.520
The winner is Rose Oriana!

00:10:43.621 --> 00:10:45.122
(crowd cheering)

00:10:45.223 --> 00:10:47.460
Wait, please! I still haven't
shown you all that I can do!

00:10:47.561 --> 00:10:49.866
No, it's too dangerous
for you to go on!

00:10:49.966 --> 00:10:51.737
Get a stretcher, now!

00:10:51.837 --> 00:10:54.542
[Rose] It may be true
that I won the fight.

00:10:54.642 --> 00:10:57.414
However, I'm utterly defeated
in the battle of our spirits.

00:10:57.515 --> 00:10:59.952
[medics] The patient is in
shock! He's lashing out!
[Cid] Let me go! Let me go!

00:11:00.052 --> 00:11:01.823
-Then calm him down!
-I still have 33 techniques
to show off!

00:11:01.924 --> 00:11:04.795
[Rose] Cid Kagenou, huh?
-It's for his own good!
Hurt him if you have to!

00:11:06.032 --> 00:11:08.035
[Rose] You have my respect.

00:11:08.604 --> 00:11:10.941
(crowd cheering)

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:19.457
(indistinct chatter)

00:11:21.095 --> 00:11:22.865
[students] Yes!
-Yeah, get him!

00:11:22.965 --> 00:11:24.702
-Go for it!
-All right!

00:11:24.802 --> 00:11:26.271
Oh, the dark horse.

00:11:26.371 --> 00:11:29.579
Can't raise a sword against
your betrothed? Really?

00:11:29.679 --> 00:11:34.121
[Kagenou]
<i>I hope I get a chance to show
off the rest of my techniques.</i>

00:11:34.221 --> 00:11:36.593
<i>I almost just wish I could be
in that cliched scene,</i>

00:11:36.693 --> 00:11:38.530
<i>that's all.</i>
(rapid footsteps)

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:40.132
[Cid] Huh?

00:11:42.037 --> 00:11:44.007
Oh, sorry, excuse me.

00:11:44.107 --> 00:11:47.648
You're not hurt too badly,
are you? (shimmer)

00:11:47.748 --> 00:11:50.721
[Cid] You're... who again?

00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:55.531
[Sherry]
So, I watched your match.

00:11:55.631 --> 00:11:57.200
[Cid] You did? Thanks.

00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:00.206
[Sherry]
I don't usually watch sword
fights or that kind of thing

00:12:00.306 --> 00:12:02.210
but the way you kept
standing back up,

00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:05.483
I think it was just
totally incredible.

00:12:05.585 --> 00:12:07.019
[Cid] You think?

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:09.158
[Kagenou] <i>This girl has a
strange way of seeing things</i>

00:12:09.258 --> 00:12:12.163
<i>but I guess some people
are like that.</i>

00:12:13.466 --> 00:12:15.036
So, I um, uh...

00:12:15.136 --> 00:12:17.575
This is...
I made these for you!

00:12:17.675 --> 00:12:19.278
[Cid] Huh?

00:12:19.378 --> 00:12:20.213
What is it?

00:12:20.313 --> 00:12:22.685
[Sherry]
I baked you some cookies.

00:12:22.786 --> 00:12:23.887
As a thank you.

00:12:23.987 --> 00:12:26.325
<i>A thank you? For what?</i>

00:12:26.425 --> 00:12:28.296
<i>Maybe she's thanking me
for showing her</i>

00:12:28.396 --> 00:12:30.801
<i>those sweet background
character moves.</i>

00:12:30.901 --> 00:12:33.038
[Cid] Uh, thanks.

00:12:33.138 --> 00:12:35.845
S-so if it's all right
with you and all,

00:12:35.945 --> 00:12:37.715
I would like for us to be...

00:12:37.815 --> 00:12:39.585
I would like for us
to be friends!

00:12:39.685 --> 00:12:41.055
<i>Friends?</i>

00:12:41.155 --> 00:12:44.495
<i>I mean, I don't really
see a problem with that.</i>

00:12:44.596 --> 00:12:46.098
[Cid] Okay.

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.169
(giggles happily)

00:12:48.269 --> 00:12:51.308
Yes! I did it!
I can't believe it happened!

00:12:51.408 --> 00:12:52.477
I'm so happy!

00:12:52.578 --> 00:12:54.447
We're friends now, Father!

00:12:54.548 --> 00:12:55.951
[Cid] Huh?

00:12:56.051 --> 00:12:57.922
[Kagenou] <i>Lutheran Barnett,
assistant principal</i>

00:12:58.022 --> 00:13:00.126
<i>of the Academy of Science.</i>

00:13:01.495 --> 00:13:02.865
<i>A master swordsman,</i>

00:13:02.965 --> 00:13:05.504
<i>accomplished in both martial
and scholastic arts,</i>

00:13:05.604 --> 00:13:08.308
<i>who was once even champion at
the Bushin Festival.</i>

00:13:08.409 --> 00:13:10.981
<i>He's on the list of people I
should never interact with</i>

00:13:11.081 --> 00:13:13.787
<i>if I wanna remain as
obscure as possible.</i>

00:13:13.887 --> 00:13:15.924
<i>So if this girl is
calling him father,</i>

00:13:16.024 --> 00:13:18.830
<i>she must be Sherry Barnett.</i>

00:13:18.931 --> 00:13:21.636
<i>Unquestionably
a named character.</i>

00:13:21.736 --> 00:13:23.908
<i>I always figured I wouldn't
really come into contact</i>

00:13:24.008 --> 00:13:25.845
<i>with students from
the Science Academy.</i>

00:13:25.945 --> 00:13:27.380
<i>I was careless.</i>

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:30.219
[Sherry] Are you sure
you're not in any pain?

00:13:30.319 --> 00:13:32.057
[Cid] Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

00:13:32.157 --> 00:13:35.197
I expect you to see a doctor,
young man. You hear me?

00:13:35.297 --> 00:13:38.069
[Cid] Yeah, I will.
Maybe on my way home.

00:13:38.169 --> 00:13:39.939
[Kagenou] <i>But not really,
because they'll find out</i>

00:13:40.039 --> 00:13:41.375
<i>I'm not actually hurt.</i>

00:13:41.475 --> 00:13:44.147
[Lutheran] This girl is so
devoted to her research.

00:13:44.247 --> 00:13:46.953
In fact, she's currently
absorbed in a project

00:13:47.053 --> 00:13:50.159
researching an artifact
for the Knight Order.

00:13:50.259 --> 00:13:53.633
That's probably why she has
never made any real friends.

00:13:53.733 --> 00:13:54.836
No, please, Father!

00:13:54.936 --> 00:13:57.474
(chuckles)
(pouts)

00:13:57.575 --> 00:14:00.581
She seems carefree now, but
she's been through a lot.

00:14:00.681 --> 00:14:03.821
If it's not too much to ask,
please be good to her.

00:14:03.921 --> 00:14:05.090
[Cid] Sure.

00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:07.193
<i>No, I'm a nobody
background character.</i>

00:14:07.293 --> 00:14:10.601
<i>So being good to a named
character is kinda...</i>

00:14:10.701 --> 00:14:13.640
<i>But look at them.
I can't say that to them now,</i>
(Sherry giggles happily)

00:14:13.741 --> 00:14:16.278
<i>so I'll just use my injuries
as an excuse to stay home</i>

00:14:16.378 --> 00:14:18.884
<i>for a few days and
give us some distance.</i>

00:14:18.984 --> 00:14:21.221
[Po] The favorite to win...
(indistinct chatter)

00:14:21.321 --> 00:14:23.660
[Skel] ...forfeited the match
because of his horoscope.

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:25.597
What the hell?

00:14:25.697 --> 00:14:28.001
(gentle music)

00:14:33.078 --> 00:14:34.949
(Sherry sighs)

00:14:37.688 --> 00:14:39.558
What has gotten into me?

00:14:39.659 --> 00:14:42.063
Something's off.

00:14:42.163 --> 00:14:46.072
I mean, Cid DID say
something about a doctor.

00:14:46.172 --> 00:14:48.743
I could go visit him.

00:14:48.844 --> 00:14:51.414
That wouldn't be weird,
or would it?

00:14:52.050 --> 00:14:54.454
We're friends, right?

00:14:54.555 --> 00:14:56.692
(gentle music continues)

00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:00.132
(gasps)

00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:03.741
(chocolate crunching)

00:15:03.841 --> 00:15:05.342
Ah...

00:15:08.349 --> 00:15:10.086
Okay...

00:15:10.186 --> 00:15:12.524
(indistinct chatter)

00:15:18.102 --> 00:15:20.340
Yum, that's tasty.

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:23.246
Black is the only way
to drink coffee.

00:15:23.346 --> 00:15:25.751
The way the sweet tooth begs
for gallons of milk

00:15:25.851 --> 00:15:26.753
and tons of sugar...

00:15:26.853 --> 00:15:29.057
It's blasphemy, I tell you.

00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:33.733
(knocking on door) Hmm?

00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:37.207
Who is it?

00:15:37.307 --> 00:15:38.442
Uh...

00:15:38.543 --> 00:15:40.881
I'm a second year student at
the Academy of Science,

00:15:40.982 --> 00:15:42.217
Sherry Barnett.

00:15:42.317 --> 00:15:43.787
Of course, how can I help you?

00:15:43.887 --> 00:15:46.324
I'm sorry to drop in like this.

00:15:46.424 --> 00:15:47.728
Uh-huh...

00:15:48.495 --> 00:15:49.999
[Marco] Umm...

00:15:50.867 --> 00:15:52.571
Would you like to come in?

00:15:54.007 --> 00:15:55.711
[Alexia]
Please have some coffee.

00:15:55.811 --> 00:15:57.214
It's quite trendy these days.

00:15:57.314 --> 00:16:00.253
If it's too bitter for you,
I do have sugar and milk.

00:16:00.353 --> 00:16:02.624
[Sherry]
Oh, thank you very much.

00:16:03.894 --> 00:16:05.564
(coffee splashing)

00:16:08.436 --> 00:16:09.738
Uh...

00:16:19.625 --> 00:16:22.798
It's so sweet. I love it.

00:16:22.899 --> 00:16:24.569
That's the way
you like to drink it?

00:16:24.669 --> 00:16:25.738
Sorry?

00:16:25.838 --> 00:16:27.340
Oh, nothing.

00:16:29.912 --> 00:16:33.319
I think I can guess why you've
come to visit me here tonight,
Sherry.

00:16:33.419 --> 00:16:35.924
This is about your
artifact analysis, right?

00:16:36.024 --> 00:16:37.527
No, actually.

00:16:40.066 --> 00:16:41.769
The student council
election schedule?

00:16:41.869 --> 00:16:45.376
No, we don't have our election
on the same day as yours.

00:16:45.477 --> 00:16:46.913
Oh, is that so?

00:16:47.013 --> 00:16:49.183
Then what does bring you here?

00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:54.829
[Sherry]
Well, as a matter of fact,

00:16:54.929 --> 00:16:59.337
there's something I'd like to
ask you, Princess Alexia.

00:16:59.437 --> 00:17:00.741
Uh-huh.

00:17:00.841 --> 00:17:02.310
What I wanted to ask you...

00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:03.914
Well, I heard that you were...

00:17:04.014 --> 00:17:05.817
I was just wondering
if maybe you were

00:17:05.917 --> 00:17:08.556
romantically involved
with anyone?

00:17:10.694 --> 00:17:11.663
What?

00:17:11.763 --> 00:17:13.566
I'm sorry!
It's just that I heard you were

00:17:13.667 --> 00:17:16.138
in a relationship
with Cid Kagenou,

00:17:16.238 --> 00:17:18.375
and so I was wondering if
perhaps you two were

00:17:18.476 --> 00:17:21.683
still seeing
each other or whatever.

00:17:21.783 --> 00:17:22.985
[Alexia] We broke up.

00:17:23.085 --> 00:17:24.922
Huh?

00:17:25.022 --> 00:17:26.726
Yes, we have broken up.

00:17:26.826 --> 00:17:29.899
As a matter of fact,
we weren't even really
dating to begin with.

00:17:29.999 --> 00:17:31.368
We were just pretending
to be a couple

00:17:31.468 --> 00:17:32.905
for reasons I won't bore you.

00:17:33.005 --> 00:17:35.110
[Sherry] Really?!
I mean that...

00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:37.146
That is such a relief.

00:17:37.246 --> 00:17:39.785
Actually, you see, I happened
to become friends with Cid

00:17:39.885 --> 00:17:40.954
just the other day.

00:17:41.054 --> 00:17:42.524
[Alexia] Oh, really?

00:17:42.624 --> 00:17:44.696
[Sherry] Yes!
And so I got to be very curious

00:17:44.796 --> 00:17:46.031
about the two of you.

00:17:46.131 --> 00:17:47.901
I couldn't concentrate
on my research.

00:17:48.002 --> 00:17:49.237
I didn't know what
I was going to do,

00:17:49.337 --> 00:17:50.941
but I feel so much better now.

00:17:51.041 --> 00:17:52.444
I mean, it's so
wonderful to hear

00:17:52.545 --> 00:17:54.749
that you two aren't
a couple anymore.

00:17:54.849 --> 00:17:57.486
Yes, so wonderful.

00:17:57.587 --> 00:17:59.123
(angrily) I'm so happy to help.

00:17:59.223 --> 00:18:03.065
You did! Thank you so much
for talking with me!

00:18:03.165 --> 00:18:06.438
And thank you for the
delicious coffee! (giggles)

00:18:08.577 --> 00:18:09.979
(mmm)

00:18:10.079 --> 00:18:11.782
[Sherry] (humming)
[Marco] Hmm?

00:18:13.587 --> 00:18:14.254
Here, thank you.

00:18:14.354 --> 00:18:15.924
Huh?!
(glass shattering)

00:18:16.024 --> 00:18:17.527
[both] Huh?

00:18:20.934 --> 00:18:22.403
[both] Oh...

00:18:22.504 --> 00:18:26.045
(gentle music)
(indistinct chatter)

00:18:26.145 --> 00:18:28.516
[Kagenou] <i>When I finally went
back to class after five days,</i>

00:18:28.616 --> 00:18:31.121
<i>I felt like everyone was nicer
to me for some reason.</i>

00:18:31.222 --> 00:18:33.091
<i>But I was probably
imagining it.</i>

00:18:33.192 --> 00:18:34.762
<i>Nothing changing
the status quo.</i>

00:18:34.862 --> 00:18:37.601
<i>That is what a bit character
truly wishes for.</i>

00:18:37.701 --> 00:18:39.772
Is something going on
right now or what?

00:18:39.872 --> 00:18:42.343
They're going to explain how
the student election works.

00:18:42.443 --> 00:18:44.548
Election? Please, we all know
it's just going to be

00:18:44.648 --> 00:18:47.622
the kids from the highest
ranking families, like always.

00:18:47.722 --> 00:18:49.291
The third years aren't
even here this week.

00:18:49.391 --> 00:18:50.694
What's the point?

00:18:50.794 --> 00:18:52.496
[Po] They're out for that
extracurricular program.

00:18:52.597 --> 00:18:54.502
[Skel] Lucky stiffs.
If I could go off campus,

00:18:54.602 --> 00:18:56.271
I might actually meet someone.

00:18:56.371 --> 00:18:58.877
[Po] Yeah, a mature older woman
with an adult charm that
none of these-

00:18:58.977 --> 00:19:01.214
[Rose] Excuse me, everyone.
I would like to thank you

00:19:01.314 --> 00:19:02.584
for giving us your time today.

00:19:02.684 --> 00:19:04.188
We're here to explain
the election

00:19:04.288 --> 00:19:06.659
to fill the vacancy in
the student council.

00:19:06.759 --> 00:19:09.431
Mm-hmm. Now please allow me
to give you an outline

00:19:09.532 --> 00:19:11.201
of the upcoming by-election.

00:19:11.301 --> 00:19:13.773
Our former secretary has
finalized her engagement

00:19:13.873 --> 00:19:15.376
and will be leaving us...

00:19:24.628 --> 00:19:26.632
Let us begin.

00:19:27.266 --> 00:19:29.938
(tense music)

00:19:30.039 --> 00:19:32.376
(energy buzzing)

00:19:41.295 --> 00:19:43.633
(energy building)

00:19:46.839 --> 00:19:48.341
Huh?

00:19:55.858 --> 00:19:57.994
(birds chirping)

00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:02.704
The road to freedom is going
to be a rather long one.

00:20:02.804 --> 00:20:04.307
Huh?

00:20:06.613 --> 00:20:08.415
It's closed?

00:20:08.516 --> 00:20:10.052
Why are the gates closed?

00:20:10.152 --> 00:20:12.423
Class is still going on,
isn't it?

00:20:16.198 --> 00:20:17.701
(gasps)

00:20:18.369 --> 00:20:19.872
What the...

00:20:21.375 --> 00:20:23.212
[Kagenou] <i>What the...</i>
(council rep chattering)

00:20:23.312 --> 00:20:27.220
(energy buzzing and fizzing)
[council rep] ...we of the
student council are...

00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:29.558
[Kagenou] <i>I can't work my magic.</i>

00:20:29.659 --> 00:20:31.428
[council rep]
...achieve that goal.

00:20:31.529 --> 00:20:33.900
[Kagenou]
<i>Has nobody else noticed it?</i>

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.837
[council rep] As I just
explained, this election

00:20:35.937 --> 00:20:38.643
will follow the same pattern
as our standard-

00:20:38.743 --> 00:20:41.114
(tense music)

00:20:41.214 --> 00:20:42.150
(gasps)

00:20:42.250 --> 00:20:43.753
(crash)

00:20:44.722 --> 00:20:47.293
(students gasping)
(tense music continues)

00:20:51.034 --> 00:20:52.504
Nobody move!

00:20:52.604 --> 00:20:54.207
We are Shadow Garden...

00:20:54.307 --> 00:20:56.645
(clattering)

00:20:57.647 --> 00:21:00.485
...and we are taking over
this Academy.

00:21:00.587 --> 00:21:03.860
Everybody stay in your seats.
Hands where I can see them.

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:05.429
[Rose] You don't seem to
understand what kind

00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:07.199
of a place you've invaded.

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:09.370
Take over an
Academy of Dark Knights?

00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:12.678
This is hardly the act
of a sane person.

00:21:12.778 --> 00:21:14.681
[fake shadow]
Drop your weapons.

00:21:14.781 --> 00:21:16.251
I refuse.

00:21:16.351 --> 00:21:17.419
[fake shadow] Hmphf!

00:21:17.521 --> 00:21:19.758
Then you'll make
the perfect example.

00:21:24.167 --> 00:21:25.671
(energy buzzing)

00:21:25.771 --> 00:21:28.408
[council rep] Miss President!
[Rose] What?! My magic!

00:21:28.509 --> 00:21:30.179
[fake shadow] (evil laugh)

00:21:30.279 --> 00:21:33.586
So you figured it out,
but it's too late!

00:21:36.191 --> 00:21:40.065
Without magic, you can't parry
the sword of a Dark Knight.

00:21:40.165 --> 00:21:42.336
Or didn't they teach you that?

00:21:45.009 --> 00:21:48.415
Stop it now!

00:21:50.185 --> 00:21:51.321
(schwing)

00:21:51.421 --> 00:21:53.759
(blood splurting)

00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:55.763
[Rose] Uh!

00:22:01.108 --> 00:22:03.478
(heavy thud)
(blood splattering)

00:22:03.913 --> 00:22:06.050
(sploosh)

00:22:11.361 --> 00:22:13.065
No...

00:22:13.165 --> 00:22:14.668
No...

00:22:21.081 --> 00:22:23.418
(ENDING THEME)
