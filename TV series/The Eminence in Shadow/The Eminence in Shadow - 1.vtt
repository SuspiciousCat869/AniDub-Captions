(sighs)

00:00:24.181 --> 00:00:26.319
I must have fallen asleep.

00:00:27.522 --> 00:00:28.824

(gasps)

00:01:12.411 --> 00:01:14.481
Miss?
(girl trembles)

00:01:16.653 --> 00:01:17.789
Huh?

00:01:20.227 --> 00:01:22.064
Oh, it's nothing.

00:01:22.165 --> 00:01:24.368
(door squeaking)

00:01:24.468 --> 00:01:26.005
[girl] Let's go.
(car door closes)

(engine rumbling)

00:01:35.223 --> 00:01:37.628
(indistinct chatter)

(car door opens)

00:01:42.806 --> 00:01:45.143
(girl sparkling)

00:01:46.146 --> 00:01:47.682
[student]
Good morning, Nishino.

00:01:47.782 --> 00:01:49.352
Good morning to you, too.

00:01:49.452 --> 00:01:51.389
[student 2]
Good morning, Senpai.

00:01:51.489 --> 00:01:53.594
Thank you, good morning.

00:01:53.695 --> 00:01:55.196
(Nishino gasps)

00:01:59.607 --> 00:02:02.912
<i>There was a boy that I
despised.</i>

00:02:03.013 --> 00:02:04.650
(Nishino sighs)

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.285
Good morning, Kageno.

00:02:06.385 --> 00:02:07.656
<i>His grades are below average.</i>

00:02:07.756 --> 00:02:09.626
<i>Athletically,
he's below average.</i>

00:02:09.726 --> 00:02:11.964
<i>And his looks are
exceedingly ordinary.</i>

00:02:12.064 --> 00:02:14.368
Good morning, Nishimura.

00:02:19.311 --> 00:02:21.717
Please, excuse me, Kageno.

00:02:21.817 --> 00:02:23.353
What is it, Nishimura?

00:02:23.453 --> 00:02:24.790
Well, it's my name, you see.

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.727
My name isn't Nishimura.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:29.833
What's that?

00:02:29.933 --> 00:02:31.603
(Nishino chuckles)

00:02:36.312 --> 00:02:37.414
[Nishino] What I said was,

00:02:37.515 --> 00:02:39.920
my name isn't Nishimura.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.355
What?

00:02:41.455 --> 00:02:43.962
My name is not Nishimura.

00:02:44.062 --> 00:02:45.932
[Kageno] Oh, I got it wrong?

00:02:46.032 --> 00:02:47.836
Yes, but that's okay.
My name is-

00:02:47.936 --> 00:02:49.706
[Kageno] Ah, hold on.

00:02:49.807 --> 00:02:51.175
I remember now.

00:02:51.275 --> 00:02:53.948
You were technically a named
NPC, weren't you?

00:02:54.048 --> 00:02:55.484
Technically named what?

00:02:55.585 --> 00:02:57.756
[Kageno]
Sorry, talking to myself.

00:02:57.856 --> 00:02:59.927
I'm actually pretty good at
remembering the names

00:03:00.027 --> 00:03:01.530
of all the important
characters,

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.034
but I haven't been
sleeping much,

00:03:04.134 --> 00:03:06.272
so I guess I got careless.

00:03:06.874 --> 00:03:08.309
You got careless?

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:09.679
<i>You've been in my class,</i>

00:03:09.779 --> 00:03:11.315
<i>sitting right next to me for
three months.</i>

00:03:11.416 --> 00:03:12.853
<i>Three months!</i>

00:03:12.953 --> 00:03:16.225
No biggie, everyone makes a
mistake from time to time.

00:03:16.325 --> 00:03:18.262
[Kageno] Yeah, sorry...

00:03:18.362 --> 00:03:19.431
Nishitani.

00:03:19.533 --> 00:03:21.469
<i>It isn't Nishitani either,
jerk!</i>

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:22.972
[Nishino] It's Nishino.
[Kageno] Huh?

00:03:23.072 --> 00:03:25.945
My name is Nishino,
Akane Nishino.

00:03:30.287 --> 00:03:31.489
(bell tolling)

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.426
[Kageno] Oh, well see you
later, Nishimura.

00:03:33.527 --> 00:03:37.267
[Nishino] <i>It's Nishino!
You inconsiderate buffoon!</i>

00:03:37.836 --> 00:03:40.608
(Nishino huffs)

00:03:40.708 --> 00:03:43.279
<i>However, his most
unforgivable crime</i>

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:45.885
<i>is not his failure to
get my name right.</i>

00:03:45.985 --> 00:03:47.556
<i>He never looks at me.</i>

00:03:47.656 --> 00:03:49.392
<i>He will turn his eyes
in my direction</i>

00:03:49.492 --> 00:03:51.195
<i>but they're always distant.</i>

00:03:51.295 --> 00:03:55.337
<i>Like he's looking through me at
some different far off place.</i>

00:03:55.437 --> 00:03:57.007
<i>When I realized that about him,</i>

00:03:57.107 --> 00:03:58.578
<i>my hatred was complete.</i>

00:03:58.678 --> 00:04:00.247
[female student] Akane,
you're playing the lead

00:04:00.347 --> 00:04:01.751
in the Monday night drama,
right?

00:04:01.851 --> 00:04:02.752
That's so cool, Akane.

00:04:02.853 --> 00:04:04.489
So, how many shows
have you done now?

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.960
You're even busier than you
were last year, huh?

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.129
Please, stop.

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:09.298
I'm so incredibly
nervous about it.

00:04:09.398 --> 00:04:10.668
I could just die.

00:04:10.768 --> 00:04:12.706
[male student] I can't wait to
see you act again.

00:04:12.806 --> 00:04:14.442
<i>I have done everything
in my power</i>

00:04:14.543 --> 00:04:16.680
<i>to avoid associating with
Kageno.</i>

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.920
<i>If I had it my way, I would
ignore him entirely.</i>

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:21.388
<i>But there are other reasons</i>

00:04:21.488 --> 00:04:23.460
<i>that I wanted to avoid making
a big deal of it.</i>

00:04:23.561 --> 00:04:27.134
[Kageno] 20,553. 20,554. 20...

00:04:27.234 --> 00:04:29.539
(bell tolling)

00:04:30.273 --> 00:04:31.943
(giggling)

00:04:32.812 --> 00:04:34.949
(tap running)

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:39.993
<i>When I was in middle school,</i>

00:04:40.093 --> 00:04:43.834
<i>I had to take a break from show
business because of a scandal.</i>

00:04:47.609 --> 00:04:50.214
<i>Ever since that incident...</i>

00:04:50.314 --> 00:04:52.518
<i>I've been hiding behind a mask.</i>

00:04:53.987 --> 00:04:55.190
[Kageno] Nuclear...

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:57.427
The limits of living things...

00:04:58.564 --> 00:05:00.433
(page flapping)

00:05:02.304 --> 00:05:04.909
More power...

00:05:06.178 --> 00:05:07.448
[teacher] Can I get a volunteer

00:05:07.549 --> 00:05:09.419
to tally up the school festival
survey answers?

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.590
Oh, me, Sensei! I can do it!

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:12.758
[teacher] But, Nishino,

00:05:12.859 --> 00:05:14.428
you still have makeup work
to finish.

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:15.431
(Nishino gasps)

00:05:15.532 --> 00:05:17.434
(classmates laughing)

00:05:17.535 --> 00:05:19.404
It's just because you've been
so busy lately, right?

00:05:19.505 --> 00:05:22.545
This is what makes you so darn
lovable, Akane.

00:05:22.645 --> 00:05:24.081
Come on, it's not that funny.

00:05:24.182 --> 00:05:27.221
[teacher] Then, um, you sitting
next to her, if you would?

00:05:27.321 --> 00:05:28.857
Yes, ma'am.

00:05:28.957 --> 00:05:30.762
[student] Okay, it's time to
meet for our club.

00:05:30.862 --> 00:05:33.634
[student 2] Wanna stop by
Mitsugoshi on the way home?

00:05:33.734 --> 00:05:35.136
[Nishino]
<i>I play the teachers' pet,</i>

00:05:35.236 --> 00:05:37.842
so the teachers
will like me.

00:05:37.943 --> 00:05:41.650
<i>I play the popular girl,
so the students will like me.</i>

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:45.925
<i>I've been very careful to make
sure no one hates me.</i>

00:05:46.025 --> 00:05:48.262
<i>That's how I've lived my life
up to this point.</i>

(phone ringing)

00:06:56.767 --> 00:06:58.737
Why isn't he answering?

00:07:02.478 --> 00:07:04.816
(wind rustling)

00:07:15.236 --> 00:07:17.274

00:07:38.083 --> 00:07:40.186
Hello, Akane Nishino.

00:07:40.286 --> 00:07:42.858
(Nishino gasping)
(ominous music)

00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.361
Why? Help!

00:07:44.461 --> 00:07:46.165
Not again!

00:07:47.234 --> 00:07:49.772
(tires screeching)

(gangster grunting)

00:07:51.877 --> 00:07:53.312
No, please!

(gangster laughing)
(Nishino struggling)

00:07:56.085 --> 00:07:57.822
[gangster]
Come on, stop struggling!

00:07:57.922 --> 00:08:00.259
(Nishino struggling to scream)

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:13.720
[gangster]
It finally kicked in.

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:15.591
[outsider]
All right, get her in the car.

00:08:15.691 --> 00:08:18.062
[gangster] Don't order me
around, outsider.

00:08:33.126 --> 00:08:34.629
(Nishino gasps)

00:08:41.543 --> 00:08:43.580

(gangster laughs)

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:48.824
You know,
you really shouldn't do that.

00:08:48.924 --> 00:08:50.828
The head of the Nishino
Zaibatsu's daughter,

00:08:50.928 --> 00:08:52.766
wandering the streets
alone at night...

00:08:52.866 --> 00:08:54.168
You're such a foolish girl.

00:08:54.268 --> 00:08:56.773
You might run into some
unsavory characters.

00:08:56.873 --> 00:08:59.211
Just don't try anything stupid.
We sent the ransom note.

00:08:59.311 --> 00:09:00.915
As soon as we get the money,
you're free to go.

00:09:01.015 --> 00:09:03.153
Or at least that's our cover
story, anyways.

00:09:03.253 --> 00:09:05.390
Seems like your old man's made
a lot of enemies,

00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:06.827
hasn't he, little missy?

00:09:06.927 --> 00:09:07.995
Will you shut the hell up?!

00:09:08.096 --> 00:09:10.032
Why don't you shut it,
you outsider?!

00:09:10.133 --> 00:09:11.503
Do you think you can
talk down to me?

00:09:11.603 --> 00:09:12.605
Who do you think you are?!

00:09:12.705 --> 00:09:13.874
[outsider]
I said, stop talking,

00:09:13.974 --> 00:09:16.278
you outdated, gangster cliche.

00:09:16.379 --> 00:09:18.717

[gangster]
Ugh, this is so annoying.

00:09:38.255 --> 00:09:41.328
I finally caught my lucky break
and now it's all ruined.

00:09:41.428 --> 00:09:42.665
(Nishino whimpering)

00:09:42.765 --> 00:09:44.703
[gangster] Why don't you help
me feel better?

00:09:44.803 --> 00:09:46.105
Let's have a little fun.

00:09:46.205 --> 00:09:49.211
I'll start with that pretty
little mouth of yours.

00:09:50.681 --> 00:09:52.685
Don't you dare fight me,
you little whore!

00:09:52.786 --> 00:09:55.691
(fist smacking)
(Nishino cries out)

00:09:55.791 --> 00:09:58.697
(scoffs) This should be old hat
for you, shouldn't it?

00:09:58.797 --> 00:10:02.972
I mean, it is your second time
being kidnapped after all.

00:10:03.072 --> 00:10:05.778
And the last guy
was a stalker, right?

00:10:05.878 --> 00:10:07.649
I'll make this
much more memorable

00:10:07.749 --> 00:10:09.552
than that other guy did.

00:10:09.653 --> 00:10:11.656
(ominous music)

00:10:11.756 --> 00:10:15.096
[gangster] Stop struggling!
You know you want it.

00:10:15.396 --> 00:10:16.298
Huh?

00:10:16.398 --> 00:10:18.737
(footsteps on roof)

00:10:22.512 --> 00:10:23.581
What the...

00:10:23.681 --> 00:10:25.016
Hold on, who's there?!

00:10:25.117 --> 00:10:26.418
(Nishino gasps)

00:10:28.423 --> 00:10:30.226
(glass shattering)

00:10:30.326 --> 00:10:32.163
(Nishino whimpering)

00:10:37.341 --> 00:10:39.144
(Nishino gasps)

00:10:41.883 --> 00:10:44.054
What the hell?
Who do you think you are?!

00:10:44.154 --> 00:10:49.431
[Kageno] Me? Well, I guess I'm
just a Stylish Ruffian Slayer.

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:51.904
[outsider] Stylish?

00:10:52.004 --> 00:10:54.140
[gangster] Ruffian Slayer?!

00:10:55.476 --> 00:10:58.048
Don't get cute with us,
goddammit!

00:10:58.149 --> 00:10:59.084
(gangster yells)

00:10:59.184 --> 00:11:00.755
[Kageno]
Too much pointless moving.

00:11:00.855 --> 00:11:03.092
Your guard is way down.
(gangster groans)

00:11:05.798 --> 00:11:08.035
(gangster yells)

00:11:08.135 --> 00:11:11.977
[outsider] Well, well, it looks
like you may have some skill,

00:11:12.077 --> 00:11:15.416
Mr. Stylish Ruffian Slayer.

00:11:15.518 --> 00:11:17.555
(gun clattering)

00:11:17.655 --> 00:11:19.491
You know,
I've been awfully bored

00:11:19.592 --> 00:11:21.596
since I was booted
from the army.

00:11:21.696 --> 00:11:24.067
Doing these pitiful
little abductions,

00:11:24.168 --> 00:11:26.606
partnering with a
lowlife amateur...

00:11:26.706 --> 00:11:29.679
This country's just
too damn peaceful.

00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:31.583
[Kageno]
I see, then this is perfect.

00:11:31.683 --> 00:11:33.887
I've always wanted to fight a
military man.

00:11:33.987 --> 00:11:35.958
(scoffs)
I welcome the challenge,

00:11:36.058 --> 00:11:38.730
Stylish Ruffian Slayer!

00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:40.500
Welcome to my world!

00:11:40.601 --> 00:11:42.905
(tense music)

00:11:45.978 --> 00:11:47.180
(outsider chuckles)

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:50.386
I can't go back
now that I know...

00:11:52.257 --> 00:11:54.895
how good this feels!

00:12:02.077 --> 00:12:04.749
[Kageno] Crowbars are great,
Mr. Ex-Military.

00:12:04.849 --> 00:12:06.418
They're sturdier, don't break.

00:12:06.519 --> 00:12:07.722
They're easy to carry around.

00:12:07.822 --> 00:12:09.626
And if you end up with
police questioning,

00:12:09.726 --> 00:12:11.495
you can make up excuses.

00:12:13.065 --> 00:12:14.201
[Kageno] The best of all,

00:12:14.301 --> 00:12:16.438
you can use them
like tonfa batons.

00:12:16.539 --> 00:12:17.808
Damn it!

00:12:17.908 --> 00:12:19.579
You're definitely
a good fighter,

00:12:19.679 --> 00:12:21.182
but you have a major weakness.

00:12:21.282 --> 00:12:25.323
'Cause of your tiny frame,
I'm big enough to crush you!

00:12:25.423 --> 00:12:26.593
(outsider grunts)

00:12:26.693 --> 00:12:29.198
(outsider laughs)

00:12:29.298 --> 00:12:31.869
I just have to protect my head
and I'll be fine.

00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:35.042
But if you take one hit from
me, you're finished, soldier.

00:12:35.142 --> 00:12:37.213
[Kageno] You make a good point.

00:12:37.313 --> 00:12:39.586
At my current level,
an ex-military guy's

00:12:39.686 --> 00:12:41.255
still a bit of a challenge.

00:12:41.355 --> 00:12:43.827
That's the reality.

00:12:43.927 --> 00:12:46.231
So, I should get a little more
serious about this.

00:12:46.331 --> 00:12:47.267
Huh?

00:12:47.367 --> 00:12:49.471
(tense music)

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:51.509
What the hell?!

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:53.012
(outsider yells)

00:12:53.112 --> 00:12:55.917
[Kageno] I discovered the real
potential of crowbars.

00:12:56.018 --> 00:12:57.955
They're shaped
very much like tonfa.

00:12:58.055 --> 00:13:00.861
They're heavy, sturdy,
portable.

00:13:00.961 --> 00:13:03.399
Everything about them has
immense potential.

00:13:03.499 --> 00:13:05.838
So I regularly beat up the
motorcycle gangs

00:13:05.938 --> 00:13:07.842
that disturb the peace
night after night.

00:13:07.942 --> 00:13:09.979
(outsider in pain)

00:13:11.983 --> 00:13:14.355
(gasping) Are you saying
that you're the one

00:13:14.455 --> 00:13:17.528
that beat up those bikers
with a crowbar?!

00:13:17.628 --> 00:13:20.499
You're the
Balaclava Berserker?!

00:13:21.435 --> 00:13:22.470
(blood splattering)

00:13:22.571 --> 00:13:25.209
[Kageno] They recently
started wearing helmets

00:13:25.309 --> 00:13:28.315
so it wouldn't kill them
if I hit them in the head.

00:13:29.285 --> 00:13:33.292
And the solution I found
to that problem...

00:13:33.392 --> 00:13:35.130
(outsider panicking)

00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:38.102
...was to stop using crowbars
like tonfa.

00:13:40.307 --> 00:13:41.442
(outsider yells)

00:13:41.543 --> 00:13:44.481
Because using them
like a regular crowbar...

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:46.452
...is more effective!

00:13:46.553 --> 00:13:49.224
(outsider screams)

00:13:49.324 --> 00:13:52.196
[Kageno] That is the
potential of a crowbar.

00:13:52.296 --> 00:13:54.268
The trick is to hit with the
heel of the "L"...

00:13:54.368 --> 00:13:56.305
(outsider screams)

00:13:56.405 --> 00:13:59.278
...because it
magnifies the shock.

00:13:59.378 --> 00:14:01.281
(outsider gasping)

00:14:02.852 --> 00:14:04.054
(outsider) No, don't!

00:14:04.154 --> 00:14:07.628
(crowbar smashing)
(outsider screaming)

00:14:07.728 --> 00:14:10.233
(crowbar smashing)
(outsider screaming)

00:14:10.333 --> 00:14:11.869
(crowbar smashing)
(outsider screaming)

00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:13.807
[outsider] Stop!

00:14:13.907 --> 00:14:16.680
Aaah, please!

00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:18.950
(crowbar smashing)
(outsider gurggling)

00:14:19.652 --> 00:14:21.989
(outsider gasping)

00:14:29.905 --> 00:14:32.243
(Nishino whimpering)

00:14:44.769 --> 00:14:46.271
(gasps)

00:14:48.442 --> 00:14:50.580
(Nishino whimpering)

00:14:56.024 --> 00:14:58.930
[Kageno] Next time, be more
careful walking home.

00:14:59.031 --> 00:15:00.534
(Nishino gasps)

00:15:15.597 --> 00:15:17.099
[Nishino] What...

00:15:22.912 --> 00:15:24.147
[Kageno] It's no good.

00:15:24.247 --> 00:15:26.819
If that's how I do
against an ex-soldier,

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:28.957
I'll never be...

00:15:29.892 --> 00:15:31.729
the Eminence in Shadow.

00:15:34.034 --> 00:15:35.236
(mellow music)

00:15:35.336 --> 00:15:37.039
[Nishino]
<i>After that, I called the police</i>

00:15:37.139 --> 00:15:39.745
<i>and things got pretty hectic.</i>

00:15:39.845 --> 00:15:41.248
<i>But Daddy pulled some strings</i>

00:15:41.348 --> 00:15:44.688
<i>and the public never found out
about what happened.</i>

00:15:44.789 --> 00:15:46.626
<i>In the end,
I never did find out</i>

00:15:46.726 --> 00:15:50.232
<i>the true identity of the
Stylish Ruffian Slayer.</i>

00:15:51.837 --> 00:15:54.174
(birds chirping)

00:15:55.376 --> 00:15:56.946
[girl] Good morning, Nishino.

00:15:57.046 --> 00:15:58.750
Good morning to you, too.

00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:00.688
[girl 2] Good morning, Senpai.

00:16:00.788 --> 00:16:02.791
Thank you, good morning.

00:16:02.892 --> 00:16:04.394
(Nishino gasps)

00:16:08.169 --> 00:16:09.739
(Nishino sighs)

00:16:09.839 --> 00:16:11.576
Good morning, Kageno.

00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:14.649
Good morning,

00:16:14.749 --> 00:16:15.684
Nishino.

00:16:15.784 --> 00:16:17.254
(sighs) Okay, okay,

00:16:17.354 --> 00:16:19.692
my name isn't Nishino, it's-

00:16:21.729 --> 00:16:23.533
You didn't get my name wrong.

00:16:24.301 --> 00:16:25.469
<i>And I get the feeling,</i>

00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:28.175
<i>his eyes are looking
directly at me.</i>

00:16:28.777 --> 00:16:30.346
<i>Kageno is like me.</i>

00:16:30.446 --> 00:16:34.054
<i>He lives his life
hiding behind a mask.</i>

00:16:34.154 --> 00:16:36.492
<i>That's the thought
that crossed my mind,</i>

00:16:36.593 --> 00:16:40.266
<i>but now there's no way
to ever know for sure.</i>

00:16:44.708 --> 00:16:46.178
(TV) On to our next story.

00:16:46.278 --> 00:16:50.052
Just before dawn this morning
on a city road in Sakurazaka,

00:16:50.152 --> 00:16:52.658
local high school student,
Minoru Kageno,

00:16:52.758 --> 00:16:53.860
was hit by a truck.

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:55.363
He did not survive.

00:16:55.463 --> 00:16:57.568
The police have determined that
the driver was negligent

00:16:57.668 --> 00:16:59.972
and will continue with
their investigation.

00:17:00.072 --> 00:17:02.911
We will bring you the
latest as we...

00:17:03.011 --> 00:17:05.349
("Moonlight Sonata")

00:18:05.269 --> 00:18:08.308
[Kageno] <i>I don't remember
how it started.</i>

00:18:08.408 --> 00:18:10.112
<i>As far back as I can remember,</i>

00:18:10.213 --> 00:18:12.517
<i>it's what I always
wanted to be.</i>

00:18:12.617 --> 00:18:14.756
<i>Like how everybody dreams
of being a hero</i>

00:18:14.856 --> 00:18:16.124
<i>when they're a kid,</i>

00:18:16.224 --> 00:18:18.495
<i>that's what I wanted to be.</i>

00:18:19.297 --> 00:18:20.567
(classical guitar music)

00:18:20.667 --> 00:18:23.239
<i>But what made me different
from other kids,</i>

00:18:23.339 --> 00:18:26.478
<i>is that my passion was more
than just a temporary phase.</i>

00:18:26.579 --> 00:18:31.188
<i>My passion kept burning deep,
deep inside my heart.</i>

00:18:31.288 --> 00:18:32.758
<i>The flame never went out.</i>

00:18:32.858 --> 00:18:34.995
<i>It kept driving me forward.</i>

00:18:35.095 --> 00:18:36.431
<i>I did everything I could</i>

00:18:36.532 --> 00:18:39.539
<i>to master every skill
I needed to be stronger.</i>

00:18:39.639 --> 00:18:43.345
<i>At school, I was the stubbornly
ordinary, never conspicuous,</i>

00:18:43.445 --> 00:18:46.285
<i>utterly harmless,
Background Character A.</i>

00:18:46.385 --> 00:18:47.621
<i>But behind the mask,</i>

00:18:47.721 --> 00:18:49.825
<i>I gave everything
to my training.</i>

00:18:49.925 --> 00:18:52.430
<i>As everyone around me grew up
and forgot about the heroes</i>

00:18:52.531 --> 00:18:54.535
<i>they dreamed of becoming,</i>

00:18:54.635 --> 00:18:59.277
<i>I started to feel a little,
just a tiny bit, sentimental.</i>

00:18:59.377 --> 00:19:02.183
<i>But I kept going,
I kept working,</i>

00:19:03.085 --> 00:19:05.189
<i>for the day I knew would come.</i>

00:19:05.289 --> 00:19:06.726
(orchestral music)

00:19:06.826 --> 00:19:10.266
<i>But the time came
for me to face reality.</i>

00:19:10.366 --> 00:19:13.071
<i>None of this is
going to mean anything.</i>

00:19:13.171 --> 00:19:15.142
<i>The world is overflowing
with martial arts</i>

00:19:15.242 --> 00:19:16.679
<i>and I can learn all of them,</i>

00:19:16.779 --> 00:19:19.151
<i>but I'll never get the kind
of overwhelming power</i>

00:19:19.251 --> 00:19:21.255
<i>you hear about
in all the stories.</i>

00:19:21.355 --> 00:19:24.929
<i>The best I can do,
is bust a few delinquent heads.</i>

00:19:25.029 --> 00:19:26.298
<i>If, for example,</i>

00:19:26.398 --> 00:19:28.302
<i>I was surrounded by
fully armed soldiers,</i>

00:19:28.402 --> 00:19:30.439
<i>that would be it for me.</i>

00:19:32.612 --> 00:19:35.651
<i>If I became the strongest
martial artist in the world,</i>

00:19:35.751 --> 00:19:38.322
<i>there's a chance I'd be able
to rough 'em up some.</i>

00:19:38.422 --> 00:19:40.292
(background cheering)

00:19:41.295 --> 00:19:42.932
<i>But then what?</i>

00:19:43.032 --> 00:19:45.136
(classical guitar music)

00:19:45.236 --> 00:19:48.543
<i>What if a nuclear missile fell
from the sky?</i>

00:19:48.643 --> 00:19:51.148
<i>I can tone my muscles.
I can hone my mind.</i>

00:19:51.248 --> 00:19:53.586
<i>I can polish my skills
all I want.</i>

00:19:53.687 --> 00:19:56.693
<i>But if a nuclear bomb hits,
all I can do is evaporate.</i>

00:19:56.793 --> 00:19:57.862
(truck horn)

00:19:57.962 --> 00:20:00.633
<i>That's what it is to be human.</i>
(truck crashing)

00:20:05.176 --> 00:20:07.881
<i>I have to overcome
those limits.</i>

00:20:07.981 --> 00:20:09.450
<i>The being that I want to be,</i>

00:20:09.551 --> 00:20:12.791
<i>would not evaporate in a
nuclear explosion.</i>

00:20:14.662 --> 00:20:16.866
Compromise is not an option.

00:20:20.874 --> 00:20:23.011
(upbeat music)

00:20:24.749 --> 00:20:26.886
(traffic clamor)

00:20:28.322 --> 00:20:30.660
(inaudible chatter)

00:20:32.998 --> 00:20:34.500
[woman] Don't worry.

00:20:37.373 --> 00:20:39.512
We have them
completely surrounded.

00:20:39.612 --> 00:20:42.350
They have nowhere
to run or hide.

00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:45.456
It is exactly as you had
predicted, my lord.

00:20:45.557 --> 00:20:47.394
I have only words of admiration

00:20:47.494 --> 00:20:49.532
for your foresight and
meticulous planning.

00:20:49.632 --> 00:20:52.971
We haven't had a big hunt in
ages and ages. I can't wait!

00:20:53.071 --> 00:20:54.908
I'll show no mercy.

00:20:57.848 --> 00:21:01.689
My lord, we all humbly await
your orders. We are ready.

00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:07.233
(chuckles) Excellent!

00:21:07.333 --> 00:21:11.174
<i>I'm not sure exactly what's
excellent, but I'm sure it is.</i>

00:21:11.274 --> 00:21:15.382
<i>I was blessed with a new life,
and in a new world no less.</i>

00:21:15.482 --> 00:21:17.286
<i>And I was given...</i>

00:21:17.386 --> 00:21:21.695
But now I need more power.

00:21:24.968 --> 00:21:26.438
<i>Magic...</i>

00:21:26.539 --> 00:21:28.976
<i>With this new power
at my disposal...</i>

00:21:30.279 --> 00:21:33.051
There is but one summit
we aim to reach.

00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:35.523
Let's go.

00:21:42.203 --> 00:21:44.508
(wind whistling)

00:21:47.213 --> 00:21:49.685
<i>This time,
I'm going to make it.</i>

00:21:49.785 --> 00:21:53.024
<i>I would give up everything
to get there.</i>

00:21:53.124 --> 00:21:55.531
<i>No, I WILL give up everything!</i>

00:21:55.631 --> 00:21:57.868
<i>If that's what it takes
to get there,</i>

00:21:57.968 --> 00:21:59.438
<i>that's what I'll do.</i>

00:21:59.539 --> 00:22:01.709
<i>I don't wanna be the hero.</i>

00:22:01.809 --> 00:22:05.015
<i>I don't wanna be the last boss.</i>

00:22:05.115 --> 00:22:08.288
<i>I wanna be the one in the story
who operates from the shadows:</i>

00:22:08.389 --> 00:22:10.727
(dramatic music)

00:22:17.273 --> 00:22:19.845
<i>The Eminence in Shadow!</i>

00:22:19.945 --> 00:22:22.049
