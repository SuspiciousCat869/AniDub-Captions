(people chatting indistinctly)
(water gurgling softly)

00:00:10.922 --> 00:00:12.492
(Alexia gasps softly)

00:00:12.593 --> 00:00:13.728
(chain rattles loudly)

00:00:13.828 --> 00:00:15.330
(Alexia gasps softly)

00:00:16.701 --> 00:00:19.038
Magic sealing chains?

00:00:25.685 --> 00:00:27.187
Did he...

00:00:29.459 --> 00:00:30.862
(chain rattles loudly)
(Alexia gasps)

00:00:30.962 --> 00:00:32.565
Is someone there?

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.504
(chain rattles)

00:00:36.106 --> 00:00:38.476
(ominous tense music)

00:00:38.577 --> 00:00:40.247
(Alexia gasps)

00:00:43.955 --> 00:00:45.457
(chain rattles)

00:00:46.727 --> 00:00:47.929
(Alexia sighs)

00:00:48.029 --> 00:00:50.134
(door rattles)

00:00:50.234 --> 00:00:53.073
[scientist]
Royal blood, royal blood.

00:00:53.173 --> 00:00:57.248
Finally, I finally have
royal blood at last.

00:00:57.348 --> 00:00:58.751
[Alexia] How do you do?
[scientist] Royal blood...

00:00:58.851 --> 00:01:01.523
-So are you my kidnapper?
-Royal blood... Royal blood!

00:01:01.623 --> 00:01:02.526
(tray rattles)

00:01:02.626 --> 00:01:05.665
[scientist]
Royal blood, royal blood,

00:01:05.765 --> 00:01:08.638
royal blood, royal blood...

00:01:08.738 --> 00:01:10.173
(gasps excitedly)

00:01:10.273 --> 00:01:12.044
May I ask you a question?

00:01:12.145 --> 00:01:14.281
What will you be
using my blood for?

00:01:14.381 --> 00:01:18.456
Your blood is
demon blood, blood.

00:01:18.557 --> 00:01:20.929
Blood, blood, blood, blood...

00:01:21.029 --> 00:01:22.732
I'm going to resurrect
the demon in the

00:01:22.832 --> 00:01:24.903
mod-mod-mod-modern day.

00:01:25.003 --> 00:01:26.039
(scientist laughing maniacally)

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:28.878
Oh yes, of course,
sounds lovely.

00:01:28.978 --> 00:01:30.480
Not that I know what it means.

00:01:30.581 --> 00:01:33.119
(scientist continues to laugh)

00:01:33.822 --> 00:01:36.158
(OPENING THEME)

00:03:07.174 --> 00:03:09.111
(horse whinnies)
(wheels clattering)

00:03:09.211 --> 00:03:10.882
(tense suspenseful music)

00:03:10.982 --> 00:03:12.084
[knight] Take that!

00:03:12.184 --> 00:03:13.788
Had enough yet?
(blood splatters)

00:03:13.888 --> 00:03:15.858
(wheezing heavily)

00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:18.765
You are the only person who
could possibly have done it.

00:03:18.865 --> 00:03:21.169
[Knight 2] I'm gonna ask you
one more time.

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.373
Where did you hide
the princess?

00:03:23.473 --> 00:03:26.246
[Kagenou] <i>The physical pain is
something I can put up with.</i>

00:03:26.346 --> 00:03:27.849
<i>The bigger issue is...</i>

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:29.084
(cries out)

00:03:29.184 --> 00:03:30.855
[Knight]
Why won't you tell us anything?

00:03:30.955 --> 00:03:33.661
[Knight 2] Keeping your mouth
shut won't solve your problem.

00:03:33.761 --> 00:03:34.563
(meaty thwack)

00:03:34.663 --> 00:03:36.099
[Kagenou] <i>This interrogation is</i>

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:38.737
<i>such classic minor
character material!</i>

00:03:38.837 --> 00:03:41.442
[Kagenou]
<i>Such a high degree of NPCness.</i>
(knights laughing)

00:03:41.543 --> 00:03:44.215
<i>I cannot allow them
to outshine me.</i>

00:03:44.315 --> 00:03:46.520
(laughs menacingly)

00:03:47.555 --> 00:03:48.724
We're going to have to
make things

00:03:48.825 --> 00:03:50.761
a little more painful
for you, huh?

00:03:50.861 --> 00:03:52.364
(gah) I don't know!

00:03:52.464 --> 00:03:54.268
I swear, I don't know anything!

00:03:54.368 --> 00:03:55.403
Please, let me go!

00:03:55.504 --> 00:03:58.210
(Cid screams loudly)

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:01.148
[Kagenou] <i>How'd you like that?
I'm a much better background
character than him.</i>

00:04:01.248 --> 00:04:03.052
[knight 2] Go on, start talking.

00:04:03.152 --> 00:04:05.490
Please, just don't kill me.
Let me live!

00:04:05.591 --> 00:04:07.796
How pathetic,
now he's begging for his life.

00:04:07.896 --> 00:04:10.735
[Knight 2] I'm so tired of
hearing that worn out spiel.

00:04:10.835 --> 00:04:14.342
[Kagenou] (laughs)
<i>That was the perfect clincher.</i>
(Cid crying)

00:04:14.442 --> 00:04:18.784
<i>But still, how long is
this gonna go on?</i>

00:04:22.526 --> 00:04:23.795
[Alexia] Knowing my sister,

00:04:23.895 --> 00:04:27.267
they should have started
looking for me ages ago.

00:04:28.269 --> 00:04:29.973
(instruments clattering)

00:04:30.073 --> 00:04:31.610
(scientist breathing heavily)

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.682
Now then... (laughs ominously)

00:04:34.783 --> 00:04:37.589
I'd appreciate it if you didn't
take too much of my blood.

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:40.293
I don't believe
I'm ready to die just yet.

00:04:40.393 --> 00:04:42.933
[scientist] (laughs gleefully)
I know, I won't.

00:04:43.033 --> 00:04:44.335
I want lots and lots,

00:04:44.435 --> 00:04:47.208
so I'll make sure I can
keep taking more.

00:04:47.308 --> 00:04:49.011
Yes,
that's probably a good idea.

00:04:49.111 --> 00:04:51.683
It wasn't... It wasn't supposed
to be like this!

00:04:51.783 --> 00:04:53.821
If it hadn't been for
those brainless idiots!

00:04:53.921 --> 00:04:56.927
I get it,
I hate brainless idiots also.

00:04:57.027 --> 00:05:00.634
My lab... Those jerks, they
destroyed my laboratory!

00:05:00.735 --> 00:05:02.337
Then they kept...
they just kept...

00:05:02.437 --> 00:05:03.641
(glass shatters) Ah!

00:05:03.741 --> 00:05:06.379
Oh, you poor thing.
That sounds just awful.

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:08.684
[scientist]
It was! It was awful!

00:05:08.784 --> 00:05:12.758
My-my research, I was,
I was so incredibly close.

00:05:12.859 --> 00:05:14.563
I-I'm so close.

00:05:14.663 --> 00:05:16.332
I have to complete it sooner.

00:05:16.432 --> 00:05:18.269
I'll be excommunicated.

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:19.472
Excommunicated!

00:05:19.573 --> 00:05:21.042
Oh no, how could they?

00:05:21.142 --> 00:05:22.444
Damn it... Damn it, damn it!

00:05:22.546 --> 00:05:25.250
Damn it, damn it,
damn it, damn it!

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:26.419
Useless!

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:27.956
You useless thing!

00:05:28.056 --> 00:05:30.662
Yah! Ny-hah!

00:05:30.762 --> 00:05:32.430
(scientist inhales wheezily)
(foot thuds loudly)

00:05:32.531 --> 00:05:34.168
[Alexia] I thought you were
going to take my blood.

00:05:34.268 --> 00:05:35.337
(scientist panting)

00:05:35.437 --> 00:05:38.276
(gasps)
That's right, your blood.

00:05:38.376 --> 00:05:40.413
With your blood,
I can complete it.

00:05:40.514 --> 00:05:41.583
Well, that's a good thing.

00:05:41.683 --> 00:05:45.123
Your blood, blood, blood.

00:05:45.223 --> 00:05:46.927
Oh, I forgot.

00:05:49.332 --> 00:05:50.367
[Alexia] What is that?

00:05:50.467 --> 00:05:52.539
Your blood levels
have gone down.

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:54.274
I was forgetting to feed you.

00:05:54.375 --> 00:05:56.045
Open your mouth!

00:05:56.146 --> 00:05:57.280
(muffled grunts)

00:05:57.381 --> 00:06:00.722
(laughs maniacally)
(chains rattle)

00:06:00.822 --> 00:06:03.392
(scientist laughs maniacally)
(Alexia muffled choking)

00:06:08.203 --> 00:06:10.541
(birds chirping softly)

00:06:12.244 --> 00:06:13.780
[Iris] You may be excused.

00:06:13.881 --> 00:06:15.718
Your Highness...

00:06:16.787 --> 00:06:19.693
[Iris] Thank you for waiting.

00:06:19.793 --> 00:06:22.698
Hello, Mr. Zenon,
I appreciate your cooperation.

00:06:22.798 --> 00:06:24.669
Of course, Princess Iris.

00:06:24.769 --> 00:06:26.673
I feel that I am
partially responsible

00:06:26.773 --> 00:06:29.946
as the incident most likely
happened on school grounds.

00:06:30.046 --> 00:06:33.453
I doubt anyone would find any
fault in you personally.

00:06:33.554 --> 00:06:36.526
Right now, our highest priority
is saving Alexia.

00:06:36.627 --> 00:06:37.695
Yes, of course.

00:06:37.795 --> 00:06:39.666
We must find your sister.

00:06:39.766 --> 00:06:41.804
[Iris] I understand that
there's a strong possibility

00:06:41.904 --> 00:06:44.341
she was kidnapped by a student
named Cid Kagenou?

00:06:44.441 --> 00:06:47.616
[Zenon]
It's true the circumstantial
evidence is against him,

00:06:47.716 --> 00:06:49.185
but knowing his skill level,

00:06:49.285 --> 00:06:51.389
even if he did attack
Princess Alexia,

00:06:51.489 --> 00:06:53.728
I doubt he could have
overpowered her.

00:06:53.828 --> 00:06:55.497
After five days of
interrogation,

00:06:55.598 --> 00:06:57.502
he seems to have
given us nothing.

00:06:57.602 --> 00:06:59.238
But I think it would
be a good idea

00:06:59.338 --> 00:07:01.375
to monitor him
once he has been released.

00:07:01.475 --> 00:07:02.912
[Zenon] As long as he
remains a suspect,

00:07:03.013 --> 00:07:04.649
that is the
right course of action.

00:07:04.749 --> 00:07:07.054
However, I am inclined
to believe him.

00:07:07.154 --> 00:07:10.828
I would also prefer not to
suspect my sister's
schoolmates.

00:07:10.928 --> 00:07:13.967
We'll wait for the report
before we make a decision.

00:07:14.068 --> 00:07:15.638
Still... (sighs)

00:07:15.738 --> 00:07:17.976
My sister has been kidnapped
and I just don't have

00:07:18.076 --> 00:07:20.881
nearly enough personnel
to send after her.

00:07:20.982 --> 00:07:22.484
[Zenon]
Everyone knows that you are

00:07:22.585 --> 00:07:24.890
stronger than the average
knight, Princess Iris.

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:27.729
But we must take into account
that you are a princess

00:07:27.829 --> 00:07:29.533
and that makes you a target.

00:07:29.633 --> 00:07:31.570
[Iris] I'm sure the highest
ranking officials struggle

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:33.540
to know what to do with me.

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:34.976
I know how you feel.

00:07:35.076 --> 00:07:37.649
If there's anything I can do,
I'm here.

00:07:37.749 --> 00:07:39.418
[Iris] In that case,
I'd like you to assist

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:41.389
in maintaining order
at the academy.

00:07:41.489 --> 00:07:43.794
[Zenon] The students are
all under lockdown.
(commotion outside)

00:07:43.894 --> 00:07:45.998
They've all been instructed
to stay in their dorms

00:07:46.098 --> 00:07:47.502
when not in class.

00:07:47.602 --> 00:07:50.106
[Claire] How can you expect
me to calm down?

00:07:50.206 --> 00:07:51.275
My brother's in trouble.

00:07:51.375 --> 00:07:52.978
Don't you see
I have to save Cid?

00:07:53.079 --> 00:07:53.781
Get out of my...

00:07:53.881 --> 00:07:55.316
[friend] Calm down, Claire.

00:07:55.416 --> 00:07:56.820
I don't need to calm down!

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:58.924
[Rose] (sword clangs)
Whatever your reason may be,

00:07:59.024 --> 00:08:01.830
you are not allowed
outside your dorm.

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:03.567
[Claire] (faintly)
Dull, uninspiring Cid could...

00:08:03.667 --> 00:08:05.871
[Zenon] Although not all of
them will listen.

00:08:05.971 --> 00:08:08.977
[Iris] I will continue to trust
you to keep the students safe.

00:08:09.078 --> 00:08:10.781
[Zenon]
As you wish, Your Highness.

00:08:10.881 --> 00:08:12.150
[Claire]
...they won't listen to reason!

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:14.488
[Rose]
You're an unreasonable person.
(smack)

00:08:14.589 --> 00:08:16.025
[Claire] That hurt!

00:08:16.125 --> 00:08:18.062
[Iris] <i>For her brother....</i>
(Claire struggling)

00:08:18.162 --> 00:08:19.566
[Rose]
I hereby order you to detention!

00:08:19.666 --> 00:08:22.103
[Iris]
<i>We all care about our families.</i>

00:08:23.708 --> 00:08:25.911
<i>Back then, crossing swords</i>

00:08:26.011 --> 00:08:29.018
<i>was all it took for us to
understand each other.</i>

00:08:29.118 --> 00:08:30.220
<i>But now...</i>

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.992
(somber emotional music)

00:08:33.092 --> 00:08:37.836
When was the last time we even
talked to each other?

00:08:37.936 --> 00:08:39.639
(bone crunches loudly)
[Rose] My shoulder!

00:08:39.739 --> 00:08:41.442
[Claire] Hang on, Cid,
your sister's coming!

00:08:41.543 --> 00:08:42.578
[Rose] Seize her at once.

00:08:42.678 --> 00:08:44.314
(bodies thud)

00:08:44.414 --> 00:08:46.753
(somber music)

00:08:52.064 --> 00:08:54.201
(wheezy breathes)

00:08:59.812 --> 00:09:02.183
(bell tolling)
(wheels clattering)

00:09:05.625 --> 00:09:07.127
(thud)

00:09:08.496 --> 00:09:12.237
Go on, get outta here.
(chuckles)

00:09:12.739 --> 00:09:15.076
(train chugging)

00:09:21.422 --> 00:09:23.025
<i>I could heal my wounds
instantly</i>

00:09:23.125 --> 00:09:25.063
<i>but that wouldn't be a very
background character</i>

00:09:25.163 --> 00:09:26.699
<i>thing to do.</i>

00:09:32.511 --> 00:09:34.849
(train brakes screeching)

00:09:42.364 --> 00:09:44.702
(people chatting indistinctly)

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:46.272
(whoosh)

00:09:46.372 --> 00:09:47.875
Later.

00:09:49.612 --> 00:09:51.950
(people chatting indistinctly)

00:09:52.852 --> 00:09:54.722
(person grunts loudly)

00:09:55.423 --> 00:09:57.761
(floorboards creak softly)

00:10:02.037 --> 00:10:03.707
(whoosh)

00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:07.147
(mellow guitar music)

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:10.954
[Cid] It's been a while, Alpha.

00:10:14.061 --> 00:10:16.332
[Alpha] Here.
[Cid] Thanks.

00:10:16.432 --> 00:10:17.668
5But I thought it
was Beta's turn

00:10:17.768 --> 00:10:20.273
to be on personal assistant
duty this time.

00:10:20.373 --> 00:10:21.843
So what brings you here?

00:10:21.944 --> 00:10:24.481
I got a call to come back,
so I did.

00:10:24.582 --> 00:10:26.485
I hear you've gotten
into some trouble.

00:10:26.586 --> 00:10:29.491
(mouth full) I guess so.
But how are things on your end?

00:10:29.592 --> 00:10:30.661
[Alpha]
We're making more progress

00:10:30.761 --> 00:10:32.498
in our investigation
of the cult.

00:10:32.599 --> 00:10:35.638
We've also increased our
overall influence.

00:10:35.738 --> 00:10:37.742
We're not quite as strong
as the cult yet,

00:10:37.842 --> 00:10:39.679
but we're continuing
to grow steadily.

00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:42.985
[Kagenou]
<i>I'm sure they all live free,
normal lives most of the time.</i>

00:10:43.085 --> 00:10:44.889
<i>But sometimes,
they'll stop by like this</i>

00:10:44.989 --> 00:10:46.760
<i>to play along with my game.</i>

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:48.329
<i>I really appreciate it.</i>

00:10:48.429 --> 00:10:49.932
[Cid] Thanks for the meal.

00:10:50.735 --> 00:10:52.004
[Alpha] (sighs)

00:10:52.104 --> 00:10:54.341
You should at least change out
of those clothes.

00:10:54.441 --> 00:10:55.544
[Cid] No, I can't.

00:10:55.644 --> 00:10:56.814
I beg your pardon?

00:10:56.914 --> 00:10:58.382
Do you understand
the position you're in?

00:10:58.483 --> 00:11:00.854
The way things are going,
you'll be blamed for the crime.

00:11:00.955 --> 00:11:03.894
Yeah, I know. The lackluster son
of a poor, pathetic baron

00:11:03.994 --> 00:11:05.496
is the perfect patsy.

00:11:05.597 --> 00:11:07.901
We simply cannot trust
the Knight Order.

00:11:08.002 --> 00:11:09.873
You're saying
the cult got to them?

00:11:09.973 --> 00:11:11.709
Yes, beyond any doubt.

00:11:11.809 --> 00:11:14.248
It was the cult who kidnapped
the princess, you see.

00:11:14.348 --> 00:11:17.187
The royal family has a higher
concentration of hero's blood.

00:11:17.287 --> 00:11:19.926
Which means she's still alive,
after all.

00:11:20.026 --> 00:11:22.865
If she dies,
they can't extract more blood.

00:11:22.965 --> 00:11:24.636
I don't know why
you're cultivating

00:11:24.736 --> 00:11:27.609
a romantic relationship
with her highness...

00:11:27.709 --> 00:11:30.279
I don't think any romance
was cultivated.

00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:33.052
[Alpha] I know.

00:11:33.152 --> 00:11:37.094
I know you carry a heavy burden
on your shoulders.

00:11:37.194 --> 00:11:39.900
But I really wish you would
trust us more than you do.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.636
[Cid] I know, I will.

00:11:41.736 --> 00:11:43.072
[Alpha] All right then.

00:11:43.172 --> 00:11:46.547
Once we've solved this case,
you owe me some Tuna King.

00:11:46.647 --> 00:11:48.182
That was MY sandwich.

00:11:48.282 --> 00:11:50.286
(whoosh)

00:11:51.757 --> 00:11:54.094
You lie low here for a while.
You understand me?

00:11:54.194 --> 00:11:56.900
I will send back word when
we're ready for you, okay?

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.337
(mellow romantic music)

00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:03.012
Incidentally, I want to ask

00:12:03.112 --> 00:12:05.751
about the two men who
interrogated you.

00:12:05.851 --> 00:12:07.989
Would you mind if we
disposed of them first?

00:12:08.089 --> 00:12:09.726
Disposed of them? Why?

00:12:09.826 --> 00:12:11.997
They were only doing what
they were ordered to do.

00:12:12.097 --> 00:12:15.036
As a matter of fact,
I say they deserve a reward.

00:12:15.136 --> 00:12:16.640
A reward?

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:18.844
Well,
tell me if you change your mind.

00:12:18.944 --> 00:12:20.614
Oh, Delta's here too.

00:12:20.714 --> 00:12:21.950
[Cid] Delta's here?

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:24.287
Yes, she's been missing you.

00:12:27.996 --> 00:12:29.131
[Claire] Let go of me!

00:12:29.231 --> 00:12:30.734
I'm going to give them
what they deserve

00:12:30.834 --> 00:12:32.137
for hurting my brother!

00:12:32.237 --> 00:12:34.007
[Rose] Then you would be
considered a criminal too.

00:12:34.107 --> 00:12:36.011
[Claire] Oh! You just called
my brother a criminal!

00:12:36.111 --> 00:12:38.516
[Rose] I did not!
Now get back to your room.

00:12:38.617 --> 00:12:40.954
(flies buzzing)

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.304
(creature snarls softly)

00:12:52.477 --> 00:12:55.249
[Shadow] I've prepared
everything for this day.

00:12:55.349 --> 00:12:58.623
Vintage wine from Bordeaux in
the southwest region of France:

00:12:58.723 --> 00:13:00.193
900,000 zeni.

00:13:00.293 --> 00:13:04.334
Glasses, also produced in
France: 450,000 zeni.

00:13:04.434 --> 00:13:06.773
The elusive masterpiece I
happened to pick up:

00:13:06.873 --> 00:13:08.342
"The Shriek" by Monch.

00:13:08.442 --> 00:13:10.547
And to create the soft light
that will bring it all together

00:13:10.648 --> 00:13:14.956
in perfect ambiance, I top it
off with this antique lamp.

00:13:15.056 --> 00:13:17.795
Yes, my heart is full!

00:13:17.895 --> 00:13:19.397
Hunting all those bandits...

00:13:19.497 --> 00:13:21.503
Crawling around to
pick up whatever coins

00:13:21.603 --> 00:13:22.972
I could find on the ground...

00:13:23.072 --> 00:13:25.644
It was all to complete my
Eminence in Shadow collection.

00:13:25.744 --> 00:13:27.815
And now,
the time has come at last.

00:13:27.915 --> 00:13:29.350
And this one final touch,

00:13:29.451 --> 00:13:33.459
I take this letter that just
arrived today and set it here.

00:13:36.533 --> 00:13:38.570
Now I just have to wait.

00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:41.007
(air gusting softly)

00:13:42.545 --> 00:13:44.214
(whoosh)

00:13:50.961 --> 00:13:51.863
(gasps)

00:13:51.963 --> 00:13:54.300
(air gusting loudly)

00:14:01.381 --> 00:14:03.086
(gasps softly)

00:14:03.186 --> 00:14:04.454
[Shadow] The time has come.

00:14:04.555 --> 00:14:05.691
(gasps)

00:14:05.791 --> 00:14:07.662
[Shadow]
This night is a world of shadow.

00:14:07.762 --> 00:14:10.099
(dramatic tense music)

00:14:14.441 --> 00:14:16.646
(gasps)

00:14:16.746 --> 00:14:19.552
[Beta] A world of shadow,
a night with the moon hidden,

00:14:19.652 --> 00:14:22.156
truly a fitting world for us.

00:14:23.092 --> 00:14:25.029
Everything is in place.

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:26.799
[Shadow] I see.

00:14:26.899 --> 00:14:28.335
Under Lady Alpha's orders,

00:14:28.435 --> 00:14:30.507
we have gathered
all available personnel

00:14:30.607 --> 00:14:32.443
here in the Royal Capital.

00:14:32.545 --> 00:14:34.314
They number 114.

00:14:34.414 --> 00:14:35.483
114?

00:14:35.584 --> 00:14:36.719
(gasps)

00:14:36.819 --> 00:14:38.189
I'm terribly sorry.

00:14:38.289 --> 00:14:40.427
No one else could mobilize.
It's the best we could do.

00:14:40.528 --> 00:14:42.064
[Shadow] Did you hire
extras or something?

00:14:42.164 --> 00:14:43.900
[Beta] What?
[Shadow] What?

00:14:46.038 --> 00:14:47.608
[Shadow] No, nevermind.

00:14:47.708 --> 00:14:50.379
[Beta] Our plan is to launch
simultaneous attacks

00:14:50.479 --> 00:14:53.152
on all the Fenrir Sect hideouts
of the Diablos Cult

00:14:53.252 --> 00:14:54.822
scattered throughout
the capital.

00:14:54.922 --> 00:14:56.693
At the same time,
we will search for traces

00:14:56.793 --> 00:14:58.495
of Princess Alexia's magic.

00:14:58.596 --> 00:15:01.135
As soon as we find her,
we will bring her into custody.

00:15:01.235 --> 00:15:02.805
Gamma will take
general command,

00:15:02.905 --> 00:15:05.176
while Lady Alpha leads
the troops on site.

00:15:05.276 --> 00:15:06.546
I will be assisting her.

00:15:06.646 --> 00:15:09.017
Epsilon will take charge of
support from behind

00:15:09.117 --> 00:15:10.687
and Delta will
lead the vanguard

00:15:10.787 --> 00:15:11.990
and signal when to begin.

00:15:12.090 --> 00:15:13.660
Each unit will consist
of approx-

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:14.895
(paper rustles) Huh?

00:15:14.995 --> 00:15:16.498
(flourish)

00:15:17.334 --> 00:15:18.469
Oh...

00:15:19.572 --> 00:15:20.874
Is this...

00:15:20.974 --> 00:15:22.377
[Shadow] My apologies to Delta,

00:15:22.477 --> 00:15:25.049
but I will be playing
the prelude.

00:15:27.153 --> 00:15:30.492
Tonight, the world will
finally know us.

00:15:30.594 --> 00:15:32.731
(air whooshing)

00:15:34.067 --> 00:15:35.537
(gasps)

00:15:37.875 --> 00:15:39.144
You telling me after all that,

00:15:39.244 --> 00:15:41.381
not one goddamn word from
the surveillance team?

00:15:41.481 --> 00:15:43.720
[Knight 2] They must be
goofing off somewhere.

00:15:43.821 --> 00:15:45.657
Those idiots!
Do they have any idea

00:15:45.757 --> 00:15:47.661
how scary this
organization can be?

00:15:47.761 --> 00:15:48.930
Hey!
(footsteps approaching)

00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:50.700
[Knight] Is he here?

00:15:55.043 --> 00:15:56.546
(soft thud)

00:15:57.380 --> 00:15:58.983
[Knight] Hey there, lover boy.

00:15:59.083 --> 00:16:02.390
What are you doing there
with Princess Alexia's boot
in your hand?

00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:06.364
Oh wow, there are traces of
her magic all over it,
aren't there?

00:16:06.464 --> 00:16:07.701
I see now.

00:16:07.801 --> 00:16:09.906
So that's your game.

00:16:10.006 --> 00:16:11.408
Yup, that's our game.

00:16:11.509 --> 00:16:13.780
If you would've just talked,
you could've spared yourself

00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:15.818
a lot of unnecessary pain.

00:16:15.918 --> 00:16:17.755
Cid Kagenou,
you're under arrest

00:16:17.855 --> 00:16:19.592
for the kidnapping
of the princess.

00:16:19.692 --> 00:16:20.928
Don't try and resist.

00:16:21.028 --> 00:16:22.598
I mean, not that you can.
(thump)

00:16:22.698 --> 00:16:24.568
[both] Huh?

00:16:24.669 --> 00:16:27.173
(ominous music)

00:16:27.273 --> 00:16:28.944
Wait, those were our lookouts.

00:16:29.044 --> 00:16:31.181
(blood splatters)
(knight groans)

00:16:34.054 --> 00:16:35.122
[Knight 2] You little...

00:16:35.222 --> 00:16:36.291
What do you think you're-

00:16:36.391 --> 00:16:38.563
(blood splatters)
(knight groans)

00:16:38.664 --> 00:16:40.332
(knight screams)

00:16:41.703 --> 00:16:42.939
Don't think you can get away

00:16:43.039 --> 00:16:44.241
with treating the
Knight Order like this.

00:16:44.341 --> 00:16:46.212
[Cid]
You have nothing to worry about.

00:16:46.312 --> 00:16:48.348
By the time the sun is up...

00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:51.454
...this will all be over.

00:16:52.558 --> 00:16:53.960
(blood splatters)

00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:55.731
[Beta] In that instant,
the Great Lord Shadow

00:16:55.831 --> 00:16:56.933
moved with superhuman speed

00:16:57.033 --> 00:16:58.336
to stand before the
lowly knight.

00:16:58.436 --> 00:17:00.039
No sooner had his noble voice
finished speaking,

00:17:00.139 --> 00:17:01.074
than his fierce attack-

00:17:01.174 --> 00:17:03.111
(loud explosion)
(Beta gasps)

00:17:03.212 --> 00:17:05.517
And that right there
would be Delta.

00:17:05.617 --> 00:17:07.754
(tense music)

00:17:11.061 --> 00:17:13.099
(woman yelps) Help me!

00:17:13.199 --> 00:17:14.869
(blood spatters)
(woman screams loudly)

00:17:14.969 --> 00:17:16.840
(Delta laughs maniacally)

00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:19.477
(tense music continues)

00:17:19.578 --> 00:17:21.281
(building crumbles)

00:17:21.381 --> 00:17:23.720
(tense music continues)

00:17:26.759 --> 00:17:28.796
(rain begins)

00:17:28.897 --> 00:17:30.767
[Junior Knight]
The situation is complicated,
(commotion in background)

00:17:30.868 --> 00:17:33.507
but we've been able to identify
at least eight locations.

00:17:33.607 --> 00:17:36.177
The destruction is being
perpetrated by an
organized group.

00:17:36.278 --> 00:17:38.850
Have the security team focus
their attention on the school.

00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:40.053
Yes, Your Highness.

00:17:40.153 --> 00:17:41.388
I'm going straight
to the front lines.

00:17:41.488 --> 00:17:42.457
Good luck.

00:17:42.558 --> 00:17:44.762
[Iris]
<i>What in the world's going on?</i>

00:17:44.862 --> 00:17:46.431
<i>Where is Alexia?</i>

00:17:46.532 --> 00:17:48.636
(rain falling)

00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:54.447
(loud explosion)

00:18:00.259 --> 00:18:03.132
[Alexia] It's hard to sleep
with all this noise, huh?

00:18:03.232 --> 00:18:05.303
But I'd rather be awake,
wouldn't you?

00:18:05.403 --> 00:18:06.539
I don't wanna miss the fun.

00:18:06.639 --> 00:18:08.576
[scientist]
Damn it, damn it, damn it!

00:18:08.676 --> 00:18:10.747
It's them!
They're coming, damn it!

00:18:10.847 --> 00:18:15.624
It's over! Total slaughter!
Everybody dies! Damn it!

00:18:15.724 --> 00:18:18.295
The Knight Order doesn't kill
unless they absolutely need to.

00:18:18.395 --> 00:18:20.199
[scientist] I don't give a damn
about the knights!

00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:22.638
I'll kill them.
I'll kill them all!

00:18:22.738 --> 00:18:24.274
They'll be sorry.

00:18:24.374 --> 00:18:26.278
I... I made a prototype!

00:18:26.378 --> 00:18:29.518
Even this defect can
make itself useful.

00:18:29.619 --> 00:18:31.254
Go on, show them!
(blood splatters)

00:18:31.354 --> 00:18:33.627
Um,
you really shouldn't do that.

00:18:33.727 --> 00:18:36.432
Give them a taste of Diablo.
Show them now.

00:18:36.533 --> 00:18:37.668
[scientist]
Show them our wrath!

00:18:37.768 --> 00:18:39.237
[Alexia]
I have a bad feeling about it.

00:18:39.338 --> 00:18:41.408
(laughing madly)

00:18:41.509 --> 00:18:44.314
Magnificent! It's magnificent!

00:18:44.414 --> 00:18:46.752
(laughing maniacally)

00:18:47.955 --> 00:18:49.190
(loud squelch)

00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:51.195
[Alexia] I tried to warn you.

00:18:51.295 --> 00:18:53.633
(rubble crumbling)

00:18:57.942 --> 00:18:59.444
All right...

00:18:59.945 --> 00:19:01.081
(clang)

00:19:01.181 --> 00:19:03.519
(chains rattle loudly)

00:19:07.126 --> 00:19:08.262
[Alexia] You helped me.

00:19:08.362 --> 00:19:10.633
(electircal discharge)
(creature screams)

00:19:12.705 --> 00:19:13.773
(gasps)

00:19:13.874 --> 00:19:16.211
(rubble crashes)

00:19:19.686 --> 00:19:22.157
(loud explosion)

00:19:22.257 --> 00:19:24.528
(people screaming)

00:19:28.102 --> 00:19:29.738
[random man] Nooo!

00:19:30.306 --> 00:19:32.644
(rubble settles)

00:19:33.746 --> 00:19:34.716
(keys jingle)

00:19:34.816 --> 00:19:38.122
I have the devil's own luck,
I have to say.

00:19:38.222 --> 00:19:39.725
(keys jingle)

00:19:40.794 --> 00:19:42.697
Or maybe I don't.

00:19:42.798 --> 00:19:44.467
(chains rattle)

00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:48.308
Well,
I suppose it could be worse.

00:19:48.409 --> 00:19:50.279
(chains rattle)

00:19:59.063 --> 00:20:01.903
[Zenon] I can't have you
running out on us, you know.

00:20:02.003 --> 00:20:03.740
(gasps) You!

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:04.976
What are you doing here?

00:20:05.076 --> 00:20:07.146
Well,
this is my facility, of course.

00:20:07.246 --> 00:20:09.986
I was the one who funded
that man's research.

00:20:10.086 --> 00:20:11.623
That's all.

00:20:11.723 --> 00:20:13.391
(soft growl)

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:15.697
What a relief.

00:20:15.797 --> 00:20:18.202
I always thought you had to be
either a massive liar

00:20:18.302 --> 00:20:20.205
or a complete psycho.

00:20:20.306 --> 00:20:22.343
It looks like I was right,
wasn't I?

00:20:22.443 --> 00:20:25.349
It doesn't matter,
as long as I have your blood.

00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:28.022
Is blood all anybody
can talk about?

00:20:28.122 --> 00:20:29.257
You don't understand,

00:20:29.357 --> 00:20:30.794
but with your blood
and his research,

00:20:30.894 --> 00:20:33.498
I'll be guaranteed the
12th Seat in the Rounds.

00:20:33.599 --> 00:20:35.871
Then I can say goodbye
to that ridiculous post

00:20:35.971 --> 00:20:37.207
as sword instructor.

00:20:37.307 --> 00:20:38.576
The Rounds?
What is that,

00:20:38.676 --> 00:20:40.279
some sort of group of lunatics?

00:20:40.379 --> 00:20:42.952
The twelve highest ranking
knights in the Order:

00:20:43.052 --> 00:20:44.387
Knight of the Rounds.

00:20:44.487 --> 00:20:47.460
It comes with more money and
fame than I've ever had.

00:20:47.561 --> 00:20:48.764
Speaking truthfully,

00:20:48.864 --> 00:20:50.700
Iris would've made
a more fitting offering,

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:53.773
but I'll just have to
settle for you, I guess.

00:20:53.873 --> 00:20:54.943
(swords clash)

00:20:55.043 --> 00:20:56.311
[Zenon] Oh, I'm sorry.

00:20:56.411 --> 00:20:59.217
I forgot you hate being
compared to your sister.

00:20:59.317 --> 00:21:00.654
(ungh)

00:21:00.754 --> 00:21:01.823
Hyah!

00:21:01.923 --> 00:21:03.560
(swords clanging)

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:05.262
It's better than usual.

00:21:05.362 --> 00:21:07.801
But you will never be more
than a Fencer Ordinaire.

00:21:07.901 --> 00:21:09.370
Then you just watch me,

00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:13.311
and I'll show you exactly how
ordinary I really am.

00:21:14.548 --> 00:21:16.952
A flashy move you copied
from your sister...

00:21:17.053 --> 00:21:21.061
I had no idea you were keeping
something like that from me.

00:21:21.161 --> 00:21:22.898
I'll show it to you again
if you want.

00:21:22.998 --> 00:21:24.433
[Zenon] In that case,

00:21:24.535 --> 00:21:27.975
let me show YOU the skill of a
future Knight of the Rounds.

00:21:28.075 --> 00:21:30.045
(suspenseful music)

00:21:30.145 --> 00:21:31.549
(gasps)

00:21:31.649 --> 00:21:32.350
Hyah!

00:21:32.450 --> 00:21:34.487
(sword rings)

00:21:38.061 --> 00:21:39.565
(Alexia gasps)

00:21:42.436 --> 00:21:43.906
(thwack)

00:21:44.007 --> 00:21:45.544
(water splashes)

00:21:45.644 --> 00:21:48.517
You will never be
as good as your sister.

00:21:48.617 --> 00:21:50.553
You're coming with me.

00:21:52.156 --> 00:21:54.060
(singer vocalizes hauntingly)

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:56.497
(footsteps echoing)

00:22:03.445 --> 00:22:05.984
A man clad
in the purest black...

00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:08.923
(soft gasp)

00:22:12.063 --> 00:22:14.233
My name is Shadow.

00:22:14.334 --> 00:22:18.441
He who lurks in the shadows
in order to hunt the shadows.

00:22:21.014 --> 00:22:23.351
(ENDING THEME)
