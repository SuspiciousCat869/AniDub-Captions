00:00:02.673 --> 00:00:05.010
(explosion)

00:00:08.685 --> 00:00:10.454
[Mundane] Heh...

00:00:10.555 --> 00:00:12.926
There's something I think
you should know.

00:00:13.026 --> 00:00:16.466
I've only shown you 22
milliwatts of my power.

00:00:16.567 --> 00:00:19.071
No, 32 grams?

00:00:19.171 --> 00:00:21.810
Three yards,
eight pounds maybe...

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:27.387
Or knots, gauss,
candelae, newtons?

00:00:28.724 --> 00:00:30.194
It's hopeless!

00:00:30.294 --> 00:00:32.599
It's confusing trying to get
the right units of measurement.

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:35.304
I need to do a better job
honing the image in my mind.

00:00:35.404 --> 00:00:36.840
Hmm?
(pounding on door)

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.311
Hey Cid, I have an offer you
can't refuse! Open the door!

00:00:39.411 --> 00:00:41.917
[Kagenou] <i>As long as people
interact with one another,</i>
[Skel] Hey Cid! Open up!

00:00:42.017 --> 00:00:44.254
<i>that interaction will
breed annoyance.</i>
(Skel continues)

00:00:44.355 --> 00:00:46.927
<i>So why do people continue to
seek the company of others</i>

00:00:47.027 --> 00:00:49.031
<i>when they know
it will be annoying?</i>

00:00:49.132 --> 00:00:50.233
[Skel] Hey!
(still pounding on door)

00:00:50.334 --> 00:00:52.037
We're totally gonna
strike it rich!

00:00:52.137 --> 00:00:56.213
Student Council President Rose
is wanted, man!

00:00:56.313 --> 00:00:58.751
We get 10 million zeni
if we bring her in alive!

00:00:58.851 --> 00:01:02.124
500,000 if we can give them
any useful information.

00:01:02.224 --> 00:01:03.761
Let's go catch her!

00:01:03.861 --> 00:01:04.796
[Cid] Why?

00:01:04.896 --> 00:01:06.465
[Skel] Because I'm broke!

00:01:07.401 --> 00:01:08.905
I thought you were
gonna make a killing

00:01:09.005 --> 00:01:10.575
on a sure bet
you couldn't lose.

00:01:10.675 --> 00:01:11.877
Will you just shut up?

00:01:11.977 --> 00:01:14.816
I'm broke, and I'm not going to
go into all the details.

00:01:14.916 --> 00:01:16.654
But the point is,
I have no money.

00:01:16.754 --> 00:01:20.728
Ergo, for no reason in
particular, I NEED MONEY!
[Cid] Uh-huh.

00:01:20.828 --> 00:01:23.567
And of course,
we'll split the reward 50/50.

00:01:23.667 --> 00:01:25.337
And you can trust me
to do that for you,

00:01:25.437 --> 00:01:26.740
[Kagenou] <i>But the thing is,</i>
(Skel continues)

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.677
<i>I'm actually in favor
of her running away.</i>

00:01:28.777 --> 00:01:30.147
[Skel] ...in the kindess
of your heart...

00:01:30.247 --> 00:01:31.550
[Kagenou]
<i>She's a rebel who would try</i>

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.688
and kill a fiance that
she doesn't wanna marry.

00:01:33.788 --> 00:01:36.492
<i>That takes guts.
I really admire that.</i>

00:01:36.593 --> 00:01:38.263
<i>You don't see that every day.</i>
(Skel continues ranting)

00:01:38.363 --> 00:01:40.234
<i>I wish she'd let me
be there to watch.</i>

00:01:40.334 --> 00:01:42.305
[Skel] ...and I get the joy of
a cash reward!

00:01:42.405 --> 00:01:44.208
It's a win-win, don't worry!

00:01:44.308 --> 00:01:46.246
Your personal reward will
always be with you,

00:01:46.346 --> 00:01:47.516
living on in your heart.

00:01:47.616 --> 00:01:49.620
The memories of
frolicking frantically

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.890
cross the capital
under the summer sky

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.894
so that I get the cash reward.

00:01:53.994 --> 00:01:55.230
That's the greatest treasure.

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.001
Memories are the
ultimate reward,

00:01:57.101 --> 00:01:58.436
so of course you understand,
Cid.

00:01:58.537 --> 00:02:01.209
I'm saying all this for my
benefit. (ack)

00:02:01.309 --> 00:02:04.783
Time to start operation
"Capture President Rose."

00:02:04.883 --> 00:02:06.018
[Skel] Start operation, but-

00:02:06.118 --> 00:02:07.722
[Cid] Don't wanna waste time,
let's go.

00:02:07.822 --> 00:02:08.924
(Skel screams)

00:02:09.025 --> 00:02:11.062
(bushes rustle)

00:02:11.163 --> 00:02:13.499
(birds chirping)

00:02:14.368 --> 00:02:16.907
(bell ringing)

00:02:17.008 --> 00:02:19.345
(OPENING THEME)

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:56.907
(general hubub)

00:04:01.015 --> 00:04:03.286
[Kagenou] <i>For now,
I just need to buy some time</i>

00:04:03.386 --> 00:04:05.725
<i>while I wait for
Rose to cool down.</i>

00:04:05.825 --> 00:04:09.131
<i>I wonder if Rose managed to
get away safe and sound?</i>

00:04:09.232 --> 00:04:10.334
(bell clanging)

00:04:10.434 --> 00:04:11.737
<i>If I'd had my wish,</i>

00:04:11.837 --> 00:04:13.273
<i>I would've liked to
ask her in person</i>

00:04:13.373 --> 00:04:14.810
<i>what inspired her
to do something</i>

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.083
<i>so rock'n'roll
as stab her fiance.</i>

00:04:18.183 --> 00:04:19.819
("Moonlight Sonata" playing)

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:21.055
Hm?

00:04:24.028 --> 00:04:25.698
They sound pretty good.

00:04:27.234 --> 00:04:30.473
[Kagenou] <i>In my past life,
as part of my family's
educational policy,</i>

00:04:30.575 --> 00:04:32.679
<i>I was forced to
learn the piano.</i>

00:04:32.779 --> 00:04:35.283
<i>Frankly, I would've much
rather spent my time</i>

00:04:35.383 --> 00:04:37.120
<i>training to become the
Eminence in Shadow</i>

00:04:37.221 --> 00:04:39.592
<i>than wasting it on
that nonsense.</i>

00:04:40.427 --> 00:04:41.696
<i>But after a while,</i>

00:04:41.796 --> 00:04:44.001
<i>I started thinking
the piano's not so bad.</i>

00:04:44.101 --> 00:04:45.303
<i>When you get good at the piano,</i>

00:04:45.403 --> 00:04:47.140
<i>everybody around you
starts to assume</i>

00:04:47.241 --> 00:04:50.213
<i>"Oh, he's busy practicing,"
so they don't bother you.</i>

00:04:50.313 --> 00:04:53.587
<i>As someone who wanted to keep
friendly interactions
to a minimum</i>

00:04:53.687 --> 00:04:56.125
<i>in my quest to become the
Eminence in Shadow,</i>

00:04:56.225 --> 00:04:58.229
<i>I appreciated this
misunderstanding.</i>

00:04:58.329 --> 00:04:59.733
<i>But most of all,
I simply realized</i>

00:04:59.833 --> 00:05:02.271
<i>that the piano was
just really cool.</i>

00:05:02.371 --> 00:05:04.242
<i>The Eminence in Shadow
playing the piano</i>

00:05:04.342 --> 00:05:07.515
<i>in the light of the moon...
Awesome, right?</i>

00:05:07.616 --> 00:05:10.420
<i>It shows the world that I'm
not just about pure power.</i>

00:05:10.521 --> 00:05:14.295
<i>I'm also an amazing artiste.
So cool!</i>

00:05:14.395 --> 00:05:15.598
<i>The next thing I knew,</i>

00:05:15.698 --> 00:05:17.668
<i>I was pretty hardcore
about the piano.</i>

00:05:17.768 --> 00:05:19.973
<i>Of course, training to be
the Eminence in Shadow</i>

00:05:20.073 --> 00:05:22.311
<i>was my number one priority.</i>

00:05:22.411 --> 00:05:24.683
<i>But the idea of creating
the mood for a battle</i>

00:05:24.783 --> 00:05:26.554
<i>with some sweet piano music?</i>

00:05:26.654 --> 00:05:28.290
<i>That was hard to give up.</i>

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:30.561
(sonata continues)

00:05:30.661 --> 00:05:33.968
<i>"Beethoven's
Piano Sonata Number 14,"</i>

00:05:34.068 --> 00:05:35.704
<i>the "Moonlight Sonata"...</i>

00:05:35.804 --> 00:05:37.509
<i>Even under the hot summer sun,</i>

00:05:37.609 --> 00:05:40.948
<i>it conjures images of the moon
shining in the dark night.</i>

00:05:41.048 --> 00:05:42.519
<i>It's my favorite piece.</i>

00:05:42.619 --> 00:05:44.488
<i>In fact, I love it so much,</i>

00:05:44.589 --> 00:05:46.292
<i>I think it's basically
the only piece</i>

00:05:46.392 --> 00:05:47.996
<i>that could be considered
the best piece</i>

00:05:48.096 --> 00:05:49.866
<i>for an Eminence in Shadow.</i>

00:05:49.966 --> 00:05:52.939
But how does the "Moonlight
Sonata" exist in this world?

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:54.710
(sonata continues)

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:58.382
Maybe there really is someone
else who's been reincarnated.

00:05:59.151 --> 00:06:01.488
("Moonlight Sonata")

00:06:10.908 --> 00:06:13.013
<i>It looks like she's wearing a
nice summer dress,</i>

<i>which also happens to perfectly
cover her slime-enhanced
chest and legs.</i>

<i>That's Epsilon the Precise
for you.</i>

I never would have dreamed
you would come to hear me play,
my Lord.

00:06:38.897 --> 00:06:40.501
I'm not worthy of this honor.

00:06:40.601 --> 00:06:42.905
That piece was the
"Moonlight Sonata," right?

00:06:43.005 --> 00:06:44.141
Yes!

00:06:44.241 --> 00:06:46.780
Of the many beautiful pieces
you taught me, my Lord,

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:50.286
it is the piece of music that I
adore the very most.

00:06:50.386 --> 00:06:52.992
<i>I didn't mean to
teach you anything.</i>

00:06:53.093 --> 00:06:55.497
<i>But I guess I can be pleased to
hear someone else say</i>

00:06:55.598 --> 00:06:56.901
<i>she likes something I like.</i>

00:06:57.001 --> 00:06:59.372
<i>It's nice to have
something in common.</i>

00:06:59.472 --> 00:07:01.042
[Epsilon]
Thanks to your wisdom, my Lord,

00:07:01.142 --> 00:07:03.514
I am building connections
with influential people

00:07:03.614 --> 00:07:06.553
as a pianist,
and as a composer.

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.390
Composer, really?

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:10.059
Yes, the "Moonlight Sonata,"

00:07:10.159 --> 00:07:12.932
"The Turkish March,"
"The Minute Waltz," all of them.

00:07:13.032 --> 00:07:14.736
They're popular with
the nobility,

00:07:14.836 --> 00:07:17.341
and the Royal Capital has
even given me awards.

00:07:17.441 --> 00:07:18.944
Seriously, awards?

00:07:19.044 --> 00:07:21.382
[Kagenou] <i>Accepting credit
for plagiarized music?</i>

00:07:21.482 --> 00:07:22.852
<i>She has no shame.</i>

00:07:22.952 --> 00:07:25.557
The Oriana Kingdom,
the kingdom of art and culture,

00:07:25.657 --> 00:07:28.229
has invited me to visit as
an up and coming composer.

00:07:28.329 --> 00:07:30.934
[Kagenou] <i>My apologies to
all the great composers.</i>

00:07:31.035 --> 00:07:32.639
[Epsilon]
As I'm sure you are aware,

00:07:32.739 --> 00:07:34.743
there's a lot of
profitable work to be done

00:07:34.843 --> 00:07:36.780
in the Oriana Kingdom
right now.

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:38.784
They're the kingdom of
art and culture.

00:07:38.884 --> 00:07:40.921
[Epsilon] Yes.
This time I think there's

00:07:41.021 --> 00:07:43.426
an especially worthwhile
job to be done.

00:07:43.527 --> 00:07:44.796
Good luck with that.

00:07:44.896 --> 00:07:46.600
[Epsilon] I shall perform
my duty, and my music

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:49.071
in a way worthy of the
sublime masterpieces

00:07:49.171 --> 00:07:50.440
you have bestowed upon me.

00:07:50.541 --> 00:07:52.712
Good luck with all that.

00:07:52.812 --> 00:07:54.448
Oh yeah, do you happen to know

00:07:54.549 --> 00:07:56.285
where Princess Rose ran off to?

00:07:56.385 --> 00:07:57.955
Where Princess Rose is?

00:07:58.055 --> 00:08:01.730
I'm sorry, Beta is responsible
for that particular case,

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:03.634
so I don't know any details.

00:08:03.734 --> 00:08:05.437
But I have heard that
she has taken refuge

00:08:05.538 --> 00:08:07.441
in the tunnels under
the Royal Capital.

00:08:07.542 --> 00:08:09.011
Underground?

00:08:09.111 --> 00:08:10.748
[Epsilon]
I'll send a messenger to Beta.

00:08:10.848 --> 00:08:14.155
That's okay, you've given me
all that I need to know.

00:08:14.255 --> 00:08:17.193
Your figure is as lovely as
ever today, Epsilon.

00:08:17.293 --> 00:08:18.864
(gasps) Y-you're too kind!

00:08:18.964 --> 00:08:22.237
Humble Epsilon is still nowhere
near what she should be.

00:08:23.239 --> 00:08:24.642
<i>Plagiarism aside,</i>

00:08:24.743 --> 00:08:26.012

My sister Iris thanks you

00:08:47.487 --> 00:08:49.225

She says she hopes you'll help
us again in the future.

00:08:52.331 --> 00:08:53.399
[Natsume] I'm honored.

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:55.804
(train rattling)

00:08:57.174 --> 00:08:58.309
[Alexia] So I was right.

00:08:58.409 --> 00:08:59.679
We should assume that
Perv Asshat

00:08:59.779 --> 00:09:01.115
is working with the cult.

00:09:01.215 --> 00:09:03.352
[Natsume] If we follow his
dubious personal history,

00:09:03.453 --> 00:09:05.123
I believe there's
no room for doubt.

00:09:05.223 --> 00:09:07.829
[Alexia] The problem is that
we have no evidence.

00:09:07.929 --> 00:09:09.933
[Natsume]
Indeed, this matter involves

00:09:10.033 --> 00:09:11.570
the government and the Church,

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:14.275
so normal evidence
will not be enough.

00:09:14.375 --> 00:09:15.443
[Alexia] Yeah, I know.

00:09:15.545 --> 00:09:17.214
Even Father broke
his usual silence

00:09:17.314 --> 00:09:19.184
to give me a stern warning.

00:09:19.285 --> 00:09:21.690
He was like, "If you're going
to tie the Divine Teachings

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:23.059
to the Cult of Diablos,

00:09:23.159 --> 00:09:25.330
you're going to need to
convince all our people,

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:26.734
and the neighboring
governments."

00:09:26.834 --> 00:09:29.405
And if they brand us as
heretics, it's all over.

00:09:29.506 --> 00:09:30.741
[Alexia]
Father keeps insisting that I

00:09:30.842 --> 00:09:33.446
not mess with the
Divine Teachings.

00:09:33.547 --> 00:09:35.050
How in the world does
he plan to put a stop

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:37.922
to all the chaos the
Cult of Diablos has caused?

00:09:38.022 --> 00:09:41.162
[Natsume] I believe he plans to
ignore it, as he always has.

00:09:41.262 --> 00:09:42.832
As he always has?

00:09:42.932 --> 00:09:46.372
Just my own speculation.
Forget I said anything.

00:09:46.472 --> 00:09:48.009
[Alexia] Fine, whatever.

00:09:48.109 --> 00:09:51.148
Anyway, Iris said something
that's been bothering me.

00:09:51.248 --> 00:09:53.419
She had an audience
with King Oriana,

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:55.591
but he seemed somewhat vacant.

00:09:55.691 --> 00:09:57.093
[Natsume] Vacant?

00:09:57.193 --> 00:09:58.864
[Alexia] It makes sense that
he would be distracted

00:09:58.964 --> 00:10:00.466
by his daughter's
act of violence,

00:10:00.567 --> 00:10:02.638
but she said it
wasn't like that.

00:10:02.738 --> 00:10:05.309
And apparently,
there was a sweet smell.

00:10:06.212 --> 00:10:08.650
[Natsume]
It may already be too late.

00:10:09.953 --> 00:10:12.391
[Alexia] The cult is still out
there, working its evil.

00:10:12.491 --> 00:10:13.694
The way Father does things,

00:10:13.794 --> 00:10:16.031
eventually, they'll get
to our kingdom too.

00:10:16.132 --> 00:10:18.704
(water dripping)
(footsteps echoing)

00:10:18.804 --> 00:10:21.843
I'm just curious, but where is
this stairway leading us?

00:10:21.943 --> 00:10:25.449
To the Royal Capital's
underground passages.

00:10:25.551 --> 00:10:27.855
But you already know
all about those.

00:10:27.955 --> 00:10:29.892
[Natsume] Yes, you mean the
underground labyrinth

00:10:29.992 --> 00:10:32.231
built across the
entire capital ages ago?

00:10:32.331 --> 00:10:34.702
Allegedly, to help the
royal family escape.

00:10:34.802 --> 00:10:37.742
[Alexia] Labyrinth...
Yeah, it is.

00:10:37.842 --> 00:10:39.478
All the maps, keys, codes,

00:10:39.579 --> 00:10:41.516
and everything were
lost a long time ago,

00:10:41.616 --> 00:10:43.721
so now it's nothing
but a giant maze.

00:10:43.821 --> 00:10:46.458
So why are we heading to
these passages now?

00:10:46.559 --> 00:10:49.130
Why, to dispose of your body,
of course.

00:10:50.567 --> 00:10:51.936
So that was a joke.

00:10:52.037 --> 00:10:54.241
You're not even
a little bit scared.

00:10:54.843 --> 00:10:58.015
Please, don't kill me!

00:10:58.115 --> 00:10:59.652
[Alexia] It's possible
that Rose has escaped

00:10:59.752 --> 00:11:01.154
into the underground passages,

00:11:01.255 --> 00:11:03.459
so we're going there
to look for her.

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:05.798
[Natsume] Wait a minute.
[Alexia] What?

00:11:05.898 --> 00:11:08.069
[Natsume]
Have you told anyone about this?

00:11:08.169 --> 00:11:10.473
[Alexia]
Why would I tell anybody?
They would try and stop me.

00:11:10.574 --> 00:11:13.246
You just said that this was
nothing but a giant maze.

00:11:13.346 --> 00:11:15.283
How can you be sure that we'll
make it back out?

00:11:15.383 --> 00:11:18.256
[Alexia] We just have to go
back the way we came, right?

00:11:18.356 --> 00:11:20.227
[Natsume] Excuse me,
would you please refrain

00:11:20.327 --> 00:11:23.567
from dragging people into
your spur of the moment,
reckless schemes?

00:11:23.667 --> 00:11:26.706
If you have a problem with it,
you can leave.

00:11:27.642 --> 00:11:29.011
(gasps)

00:11:29.111 --> 00:11:32.116
Babysitting is part of the job,
Beta.

00:11:34.755 --> 00:11:37.093
(panting)

00:11:40.968 --> 00:11:43.273
<i>What was I supposed
to do back there?</i>

00:11:43.373 --> 00:11:45.110
<i>What was the right thing?</i>

00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:48.049
<i>What would've been the
best course of action?</i>

00:11:48.149 --> 00:11:50.286
(tense music)

00:11:51.689 --> 00:11:53.960
[major domo] His Royal Majesty.

00:12:02.845 --> 00:12:05.016
[Perv] Go on, Your Majesty.

00:12:05.116 --> 00:12:08.724
[Oriana]
You may raise your head.

00:12:08.824 --> 00:12:11.896
It is good to see you again,
Your Majesty.

00:12:16.105 --> 00:12:17.074
(gasps)

00:12:17.174 --> 00:12:21.182
(haltingly)
It is... good to... see you...

00:12:21.282 --> 00:12:23.721
Rose.

00:12:23.821 --> 00:12:26.726
Oh, Father... (gasps)

00:12:26.827 --> 00:12:29.164
(ominous music)

00:12:31.301 --> 00:12:33.439
(cultists chuckling)

00:12:37.548 --> 00:12:38.617
(growls)

00:12:38.717 --> 00:12:40.219
(ungh)

00:12:42.792 --> 00:12:43.860
(gasps)

00:12:43.961 --> 00:12:46.899
[all]
Princess Rose has gone crazy!

00:12:48.269 --> 00:12:50.406
(tense music)

00:12:52.512 --> 00:12:57.186
[Rose] <i>At the time, I thought I
had made a rational decision.</i>

00:12:57.286 --> 00:12:59.257
<i>If I could've settled the
matter then and there,</i>

00:12:59.357 --> 00:13:01.730
<i>we could've treated it all
as a domestic affair</i>

00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:04.468
<i>within the Oriana Kingdom.</i>

00:13:04.569 --> 00:13:06.004
<i>We could've stopped the problem</i>

00:13:06.105 --> 00:13:08.008
<i>from spreading to
other nations,</i>

00:13:08.108 --> 00:13:10.246
<i>like the Midgar Kingdom.</i>

00:13:10.981 --> 00:13:13.352
(panting)
(dramatic music)

00:13:15.122 --> 00:13:17.661
Turn yourself in before
the festival is over!

00:13:17.761 --> 00:13:19.031
Otherwise, I'll make your father

00:13:19.131 --> 00:13:21.168
kill one of the other
guests of honor.

00:13:21.268 --> 00:13:23.172
(panting)

00:13:23.272 --> 00:13:27.180
[Rose] <i>But what I did was not a
rational thing to do.</i>

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:30.453
<i>I was only acting on my anger
and desperation.</i>

00:13:31.522 --> 00:13:32.991
I wanted to protect them:

00:13:33.092 --> 00:13:35.631
my one and only father
who raised me,

00:13:35.731 --> 00:13:37.367
my one and only homeland.

00:13:37.467 --> 00:13:40.774
Perv is just ONE of the
Cult's disposable pawns.

00:13:40.874 --> 00:13:42.511
Killing him won't
change anything.

00:13:42.611 --> 00:13:46.451
The Cult's roots have spread
too deep within our kingdom.

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:49.157
(gasps)

00:13:50.694 --> 00:13:53.032
So, what if I do get away?

00:13:53.132 --> 00:13:55.771
I'm hurting the knights
of my own kingdom,

00:13:55.872 --> 00:13:58.042
pointlessly making
the problem worse.

00:13:58.142 --> 00:14:00.747
What good will that do?

00:14:00.848 --> 00:14:03.820
Maybe I should just
turn myself in.

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:06.626
Then, at the very least,
we can avoid a war.

00:14:07.394 --> 00:14:08.897
And then Father...

00:14:08.997 --> 00:14:11.334
(emotional music)

00:14:14.107 --> 00:14:18.216
Would you keep believing in me,
no matter what happens?

00:14:18.316 --> 00:14:19.686
[Cid] Sure.

00:14:19.786 --> 00:14:21.288
I will.

00:14:22.256 --> 00:14:23.459
Oh, Cid...

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:26.799
Surely you know
what's happened by now.

00:14:26.899 --> 00:14:30.439
But do you still believe in me?

00:14:32.077 --> 00:14:34.448
I wish I could eliminate
Perv and his sort,

00:14:34.549 --> 00:14:35.817
and get my father back.

00:14:35.917 --> 00:14:38.455
Then I'd marry you and
live happily ever after.

00:14:38.556 --> 00:14:40.961
If only such fairytale endings
were real.

00:14:41.061 --> 00:14:42.330
(pulse booms)

00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:43.967
(gasps)

00:14:46.138 --> 00:14:48.308
But in reality, I'm possessed.

00:14:48.409 --> 00:14:52.618
None of my dreams were ever
meant to come true, after all.

00:15:01.837 --> 00:15:03.439
("Moonlight Sonata"
playing faintly)

00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:05.042
Oh...

00:15:12.525 --> 00:15:14.662
The "Moonlight Sonata?"

00:15:30.794 --> 00:15:31.863
(grunts)

00:15:31.963 --> 00:15:34.300
(music is louder)

00:15:55.778 --> 00:15:58.115
(sonata continues)

00:15:59.919 --> 00:16:01.622
It's you.

00:16:02.791 --> 00:16:04.294
Shadow...

00:16:17.353 --> 00:16:19.692
(sonata draws to an end)

00:16:26.639 --> 00:16:28.776
(feather rustling)

00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:35.858
I've heard the
"Moonlight Sonata" many times,

00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:37.160
but that is without a doubt

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.430
the best performance
I've ever experienced.

00:16:39.531 --> 00:16:41.802
What do you hope to accomplish?

00:16:44.008 --> 00:16:46.378
(dramatic music)

00:16:47.948 --> 00:16:50.720
I wanted to protect them.

00:16:51.957 --> 00:16:53.225
But I couldn't.

00:16:53.325 --> 00:16:55.162
I couldn't do anything.

00:16:55.262 --> 00:16:58.201
[Shadow]
And you would let it end there?

00:16:58.301 --> 00:17:01.208
So you would put down your
sword, and stop fighting?

00:17:01.308 --> 00:17:04.247
Believe me, I never wanted
it to end this way.

00:17:04.347 --> 00:17:07.789
I wanted the brightest future
for everyone.

00:17:07.889 --> 00:17:09.290
(electrical discharge)

00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:12.296
[Shadow] If you have any desire
to keep up that fight...

00:17:12.397 --> 00:17:15.303
I will give you the
power you need.

00:17:15.403 --> 00:17:16.706
(gasps)

00:17:17.474 --> 00:17:20.212
[Rose] If I use that power,

00:17:20.313 --> 00:17:22.785
will I be able to
change the future?

00:17:22.885 --> 00:17:24.789
That all depends on you.

00:17:24.889 --> 00:17:28.896
(gasps) I am Rose,
the princess of Oriana Kingdom,

00:17:28.997 --> 00:17:30.668
and there are things
that I must do!

00:17:30.768 --> 00:17:34.174
As Rose Oriana, there are hopes
I want to keep alive!

00:17:34.274 --> 00:17:36.478
I want the power
to achieve that!

00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:39.117
(dramatic music)

00:17:39.217 --> 00:17:41.087
What's happening?

00:17:41.656 --> 00:17:43.158
(gasps)

00:17:45.698 --> 00:17:46.732
Incredible!

00:17:46.832 --> 00:17:49.505
So this is Shadow's true magic?

00:17:49.605 --> 00:17:50.840
[Shadow] Rise up...

00:17:50.941 --> 00:17:54.615
and prove to me that you're
willing to keep up the fight.

00:17:55.917 --> 00:17:59.959
Never forget, true strength
lies not in one's power,

00:18:00.059 --> 00:18:02.363
but in one's way of being.

00:18:04.034 --> 00:18:06.806
(dramatic music)

00:18:06.906 --> 00:18:09.243
(figures whooshing)

00:18:11.683 --> 00:18:12.851
I know those uniforms.

00:18:12.952 --> 00:18:15.657
So you belong to
the Cult of Diablos.

00:18:17.594 --> 00:18:21.602
The fact that you are
appearing here at this
particular moment means...

00:18:23.472 --> 00:18:26.378
(sword clangs)
(music pauses)

00:18:26.478 --> 00:18:28.783
(blood splatters)
(music resumes)

00:18:28.883 --> 00:18:30.219
Shadow...

00:18:30.319 --> 00:18:33.527
He is a ray of moonlight that
pierces the darkness.

00:18:33.627 --> 00:18:36.231
If I had my wish, I would too.
(blood rains down)

00:18:36.332 --> 00:18:38.436
(girls panting)

00:18:38.537 --> 00:18:41.141
What was that burst
of magical energy?

00:18:41.509 --> 00:18:42.811
(gasps)

00:18:47.721 --> 00:18:48.790
[Alexia] Rose!

00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:49.958
(gasps)

00:18:50.059 --> 00:18:51.629
[Rose] Alexia...

00:18:51.729 --> 00:18:53.232
Look at you.

00:18:53.332 --> 00:18:55.436
What was that burst of magic?

00:18:55.537 --> 00:18:57.307
Rose?

00:18:57.407 --> 00:18:59.578
I have obtained power.

00:18:59.679 --> 00:19:02.216
I will follow the path
I believe in.

00:19:02.316 --> 00:19:04.956
[Alexia] Wait a minute!
What are you talking about?

00:19:05.056 --> 00:19:07.360
Why did you stab your fiance?

00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:10.734
[Rose] I'm sorry, I don't
want to drag you into this.

00:19:10.834 --> 00:19:14.508
[Alexia]
That doesn't tell me anything!
Answer the question!

00:19:16.846 --> 00:19:20.453
[Rose] If I tell you,
you WILL get dragged into it.

00:19:20.554 --> 00:19:24.093
At the Sanctuary,
we promised each other.

00:19:24.194 --> 00:19:26.131
If we're never more
than spectators,

00:19:26.231 --> 00:19:28.670
someday we'll lose
everything we care about.

00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:30.272
That's why we
promised each other

00:19:30.372 --> 00:19:32.409
we'd protect those
things together.

00:19:32.511 --> 00:19:34.649
So how can you talk
to me like this?

00:19:34.749 --> 00:19:37.654
Do you think I'm only as
good as a spectator?

00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:40.226
I'm sorry.

00:19:40.326 --> 00:19:41.394
[Alexia] Answer me!

00:19:41.495 --> 00:19:44.133
There's no turning back
for me now.

00:19:44.234 --> 00:19:45.571
And I envy you.

00:19:45.671 --> 00:19:47.240
Tell me why.

00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:49.812
[Rose] I've lost a number
of things already,

00:19:49.912 --> 00:19:51.816
and I'm going to lose more.

00:19:51.916 --> 00:19:55.489
Everyone will reject me,
denounce me as evil.

00:19:55.991 --> 00:19:57.160
Yeah, so what?

00:19:57.260 --> 00:19:58.597
That doesn't matter.
(electrical discharge)

00:19:58.697 --> 00:20:01.869
I'm so sorry,
I have to leave you now.

00:20:01.969 --> 00:20:04.408
[Alexia] All right, fine!
If you won't give me answers,

00:20:04.509 --> 00:20:05.844
I'll force them out of you!

00:20:05.944 --> 00:20:07.982
(emotional music)

00:20:08.082 --> 00:20:10.419
(explosion)

00:20:14.327 --> 00:20:17.601
I'm not just
a spectator anymore.

00:20:19.104 --> 00:20:21.008
(hyaaah)

00:20:21.108 --> 00:20:22.611
(gasps)

00:20:25.717 --> 00:20:28.556
(hyaaah)

00:20:29.424 --> 00:20:31.762
(explosion)

00:20:32.363 --> 00:20:34.701
(energy whooshing)

00:20:40.781 --> 00:20:42.918
(water trickling)

00:20:46.526 --> 00:20:50.834
Alexia, when did you
get to be this strong?

00:20:51.903 --> 00:20:55.810
[Rose] Miss Natsume,
I'm sorry, I have to go.

00:20:59.117 --> 00:21:02.357
[Natsume]
I won't try to stop you.

00:21:02.457 --> 00:21:05.496
I don't believe I have the
right to stop you, Princess.

00:21:05.597 --> 00:21:07.133
[Rose] Miss Natsume?

00:21:07.233 --> 00:21:09.370
But I must say,
I'm a little surprised.

00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:12.611
I suppose even fools try to
find the best solutions.

00:21:12.712 --> 00:21:14.749
We each have
different nationalities,

00:21:14.849 --> 00:21:17.353
different affiliations,
different creeds,

00:21:17.453 --> 00:21:20.392
but maybe the ideals we strive
for are the same.

00:21:20.492 --> 00:21:22.564
It's possible that
this alliance of ours

00:21:22.664 --> 00:21:25.202
wasn't such a
bad idea after all.

00:21:25.302 --> 00:21:26.939
I wish you great success.

00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:30.145
I suspect that our paths will
cross again before too long,

00:21:30.245 --> 00:21:31.916
and I hope for that.

00:21:35.422 --> 00:21:37.761
(footsteps receding)

00:21:39.698 --> 00:21:45.510
Is this really what you have
chosen for her, Lord Shadow?

00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:51.421
[staff]
Yes, it just disappeared.

00:21:51.522 --> 00:21:54.761
And in broad daylight?
How very strange.

00:21:54.862 --> 00:21:57.366
[Kagenou] <i>A melody that echoes
through the darkness...</i>

00:21:57.467 --> 00:21:58.837
<i>The words that
spring like a song</i>

00:21:58.937 --> 00:22:01.509
<i>from the mouth of the
Eminence in Shadow...</i>

00:22:01.609 --> 00:22:04.749
<i>Yes, I think that
went quite well.</i>

00:22:04.849 --> 00:22:07.855
I always knew a piano was an
excellent set piece.

00:22:07.955 --> 00:22:11.094
I really wish I had my own,
so I didn't have to borrow one.

00:22:11.194 --> 00:22:12.697
Huh?

00:22:21.181 --> 00:22:23.519
(ENDING THEME)
