[Kagenou] <i>According to Alpha
and the girl's story,</i>

<i>the Cult of Diablos was an
enormous organization</i>

00:00:14.062 --> 00:00:16.199

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:18.470
<i>Man, that's impressive.</i>

00:00:18.571 --> 00:00:21.009
<i>They said something about
having to fight against it</i>

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:23.614
<i>but then they just scattered
to the four winds.</i>

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:25.785
<i>But I get it.</i>

00:00:25.885 --> 00:00:29.125

<i>"So we're setting
ourselves free."</i>

00:00:43.821 --> 00:00:45.625

00:04:07.294 --> 00:04:08.564
Thanks for waiting.

00:04:08.664 --> 00:04:11.604
Hey, so what in the world
happened to your hair?

00:04:11.704 --> 00:04:14.442
[Po] We're gonna be late, Cid.
[Cid] Sorry.

[Skel] Dammit, I wish they'd let
us live in the dorms on campus,

00:04:37.655 --> 00:04:39.593
like all the upper class kids.

00:04:39.693 --> 00:04:42.364
There's no place for bottom of
the pile peasants like us

00:04:42.464 --> 00:04:45.972
in the exalted abode of her
highness and her kind.

00:04:46.072 --> 00:04:48.009
Listen, all we have to do is
become honor students,

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:49.378
like my sister.

00:04:49.478 --> 00:04:51.550
Then they'd let us live
in the dorms on campus.

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.119
[Skel]
What like be the champions

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:56.693

<i>In the midst of it, a day of
reckoning has arrived.</i>

00:05:05.778 --> 00:05:07.314
Anyway,
you remember the penalty

00:05:07.414 --> 00:05:08.450
for the guy who
scored the worst

00:05:08.551 --> 00:05:09.786
on yesterday's test, right?

00:05:09.886 --> 00:05:12.324
You lost the bet, Cid.
You have to do it.

00:05:12.424 --> 00:05:14.294
I know what I have to do,
but...

00:05:14.395 --> 00:05:15.865
[Kagenou]
<i>The penalty in question</i>

00:05:15.965 --> 00:05:18.537
<i>is to confess love to the most
popular girl in school</i>

00:05:18.638 --> 00:05:20.173
<i>and suffer her brutal
rejection.</i>

00:05:20.274 --> 00:05:22.579
<i>This is exactly the kind of

[Kagenou]
<i>And the girl in question is...</i>

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:33.266
[Po] So what are you going-

00:05:33.366 --> 00:05:36.373
Oh, most beautiful
Princess Alexia,

00:05:36.473 --> 00:05:38.611
goddess of our campus!

00:05:38.711 --> 00:05:42.785
I humbly ask you to join me in
pure and upstanding courtship.

(upbeat chamber music)

00:05:46.325 --> 00:05:47.461
[Alexia] Not interested.

[Po]
That's the princess for you.
(Romeo sobbing)

I know she's destined for
political marriage

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:54.542
after she graduates, but...

00:05:54.642 --> 00:05:55.712
[Skel] He wouldn't
have been a bad choice

00:05:55.812 --> 00:05:57.882
for someone to
fool around with.

00:05:58.417 --> 00:05:59.519
Now listen here,

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:00.955
don't you go getting
cold feet on us.

00:06:01.055 --> 00:06:03.326
[Skel] You got it?
[Cid] Oh, don't worry.

00:06:03.426 --> 00:06:06.833
I spent all last night planning
out how I was going to do it.

and fall on my face.</i>

00:06:53.426 --> 00:06:55.130
[Alexia] All right, I will.

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:57.502
Huh?

00:06:57.602 --> 00:07:00.674
I've been waiting for someone
exactly like you.

00:07:00.774 --> 00:07:03.346
Here's to our new relationship.

00:07:03.446 --> 00:07:05.684

[students]
Look, that's him.

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:27.427
-No way! He's way too average.

00:07:27.528 --> 00:07:28.998
-This must be a mistake.

00:07:29.098 --> 00:07:30.366
-I'm so gonna kill him.

00:07:30.467 --> 00:07:32.137
-But who is he?

00:07:32.839 --> 00:07:34.543
(sighs)

00:07:34.643 --> 00:07:36.145
You don't think it's weird?

00:07:36.246 --> 00:07:37.247
Oh, it's weird.

00:07:37.347 --> 00:07:38.717
This is definitely
very bizarre.

00:07:38.817 --> 00:07:39.953
If I'm being brutally honest,

00:07:40.053 --> 00:07:41.657
you are nowhere near
worthy enough

00:07:41.757 --> 00:07:43.459
to date Princess Alexia.

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:45.898
In fact, I don't even think
I would make the cut.

00:07:45.998 --> 00:07:47.668
But she was willing
to take YOU, Cid.

00:07:47.768 --> 00:07:49.606
Maybe even I had a
chance at dating her.

00:07:49.706 --> 00:07:52.111
I should have just asked her
out myself.

00:07:52.211 --> 00:07:54.749
I'm scared, I feel like there
has to be a catch.

00:07:54.849 --> 00:07:57.288
I mean, she and I don't even
live on the same planet.

00:07:57.388 --> 00:07:58.624
Who cares about that?

00:07:58.724 --> 00:08:00.594
You could get some sweet
memories out of this.

00:08:00.695 --> 00:08:03.333
He's right! But if you want,
I could trade places with you.

00:08:03.433 --> 00:08:04.969
[Cid] Huh?
(Po gasps)

00:08:05.437 --> 00:08:06.573
(Skel gasps)

00:08:06.673 --> 00:08:08.577
Do you mind if I come
sit with you guys?

00:08:08.677 --> 00:08:10.380
(stammering) G-go ahead, yeah.

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:12.150
(stammering)
I-if th-this seat will do,

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:14.454
by all means, have a seat.

00:08:14.555 --> 00:08:16.059
[Kagenou] <i>Their sense of
insignificance...</i>

00:08:16.159 --> 00:08:18.563
<i>Did I pick the perfect friends
or what?</i>

00:08:18.663 --> 00:08:20.535
[students] She's at the lower
nobility seats.

00:08:20.635 --> 00:08:22.705
-And she's so close to them.

00:08:24.308 --> 00:08:27.615
[Cid] Wow, that's royalty for
you. Look at all that food.

00:08:27.716 --> 00:08:29.686
[Alexia]
I never manage to finish it.

00:08:29.786 --> 00:08:31.189
Honestly,
I wouldn't mind having

00:08:31.289 --> 00:08:33.460
some of the
lower class options.

00:08:33.561 --> 00:08:35.029
[Cid] Then can I have some?

00:08:35.129 --> 00:08:36.800
(both squeal)

00:08:37.367 --> 00:08:38.770
(mmm...)

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:41.576
This is delicious.
I'll have some of that too.

00:08:41.676 --> 00:08:42.712
(Skel and Po scream)

00:08:42.812 --> 00:08:44.315
[Cid]
Hey, this isn't bad either.

00:08:50.126 --> 00:08:52.599
So you are studying Royal
Bushin fencing

00:08:52.699 --> 00:08:54.301
for your afternoon PE class?

00:08:54.402 --> 00:08:56.238
[Cid] Ah... yes.

00:08:56.339 --> 00:08:58.744
[Alexia] I thought we could
take take the class together.

00:08:58.844 --> 00:09:00.814
Yeah, no, I don't think so.

00:09:00.914 --> 00:09:03.420
I'm in Section Nine,
the lowest of all the sections.

00:09:03.521 --> 00:09:04.723
Oh, that's all right.

00:09:04.823 --> 00:09:06.092
I put in a good word for you,

00:09:06.192 --> 00:09:08.229
and they opened up a spot
in Section One.

00:09:08.329 --> 00:09:09.231
Okay?

00:09:09.331 --> 00:09:11.168
(soft growl) I guess so.

00:09:11.268 --> 00:09:12.505
(both thunderstruck)

00:09:12.605 --> 00:09:13.940
[Kagenou] <i>And thus,
my lunch and operation</i>

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:17.715
<i>"Dump Me Already, Dammit!"
came to a close.</i>

00:09:17.815 --> 00:09:21.188
<i>Skel and Po remained useless
lumps to the bitter end.</i>

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:28.570
[advisor] We have a new member
joining our team today.

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:31.275
I'm Cid Kagenou,
thank you for having me.

00:09:31.375 --> 00:09:33.581
[Kagenou] <i>I'd expect nothing
less of Section One.</i>

00:09:33.681 --> 00:09:34.949
<i>Their advisor, Mr. Zenon,</i>

00:09:35.049 --> 00:09:36.953
<i>is the official
royal fencing instructor.</i>

00:09:37.053 --> 00:09:39.491
<i>Unlike the lower sections,
there's an all-encompassing air</i>

00:09:39.592 --> 00:09:40.995
<i>of constant vigilance.</i>

00:09:41.095 --> 00:09:44.134
As you know, the Royal Bushin
style that we study here

00:09:44.234 --> 00:09:45.203
is an original style

00:09:45.303 --> 00:09:47.776
derived from the traditional
Bushin school.

00:09:47.876 --> 00:09:50.814
You might say it's a new
friend, like you.

00:09:50.915 --> 00:09:53.119
We faced a lot of pushback
at first,

00:09:53.219 --> 00:09:55.858
but thanks to the genius of
Dark Knight Princess Iris,

00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:57.493
the sister of our own Alexia,

00:09:57.595 --> 00:10:01.235
we've gained enough momentum to
rival traditional Bushin.

00:10:01.335 --> 00:10:03.540
In other words,
if you have the strength,

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:04.776
you can successfully parry

00:10:04.876 --> 00:10:07.047
the skeptical eyes
of the masses.

00:10:07.147 --> 00:10:11.723
So now,
how much strength do you have?

00:10:11.823 --> 00:10:14.194
(students grunting)
(swords clanging)

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:28.891
[Kagenou]
<i>Alexia's attacks never land,</i>

00:10:28.991 --> 00:10:30.761
<i>and her movements are slow.</i>

00:10:30.861 --> 00:10:33.165
<i>She doesn't use
much magic either.</i>

00:10:33.266 --> 00:10:34.669
<i>At first,
I thought she was just</i>

00:10:34.769 --> 00:10:36.640
<i>matching her level to mine,</i>

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:38.176
<i>but she wasn't.</i>

00:10:38.276 --> 00:10:39.879
<i>The goal of this practice
is to review</i>

00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:41.617
<i>our strokes and
counter strokes,</i>

00:10:41.717 --> 00:10:43.987
<i>and she is strictly
adhering to that.</i>

00:10:44.088 --> 00:10:45.691
<i>Thinking back,
before the lesson,</i>

00:10:45.791 --> 00:10:47.862
<i>she was copying my stretches.</i>

00:10:48.864 --> 00:10:51.301
<i>In other words,
she's hyper aware -</i>

00:10:51.401 --> 00:10:54.307
<i>a perfectly honed technique
that stays true to the basics</i>

00:10:54.407 --> 00:10:56.312
<i>and forgoes any excess.</i>

00:10:56.412 --> 00:10:57.515
<i>But it's boring.</i>

00:10:57.615 --> 00:10:59.852
<i>Yeah, very dull.</i>

00:10:59.952 --> 00:11:02.525
<i>The world sees her as far
inferior to her sister</i>

00:11:02.625 --> 00:11:04.863
<i>who is currently praised as the
most powerful Dark Knight</i>

00:11:04.963 --> 00:11:06.498
<i>in the kingdom.</i>

00:11:06.599 --> 00:11:08.435
<i>But her insipid fighting style</i>

00:11:08.537 --> 00:11:10.106
<i>is the result of
a lot of effort.</i>

00:11:10.206 --> 00:11:12.712
<i>It's proof that she's built up
her skills in the basics,</i>

00:11:12.812 --> 00:11:14.448
<i>one step at a time.</i>

00:11:14.549 --> 00:11:16.218
(swords ring)

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:18.255
(bell chiming)

00:11:18.355 --> 00:11:21.361
All right then,
that's all for today's lesson.

00:11:23.767 --> 00:11:25.203
Thank you for a good match.

00:11:25.303 --> 00:11:26.205
[Cid] Thank you as well.

00:11:26.305 --> 00:11:27.675
[Alexia]
You have a good fencing style.

00:11:27.775 --> 00:11:29.211
(stretching) Yeah, thank you.

00:11:29.311 --> 00:11:31.549
[Alexia] But I hate it.

00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:33.787
It's like I'm
fighting with myself.

00:11:35.189 --> 00:11:36.058
Huh?

00:11:36.158 --> 00:11:37.561
Can I make the assumption that

00:11:37.661 --> 00:11:40.734
that is your answer then,
Alexia?

00:11:41.335 --> 00:11:42.772
Yes, that's correct.

00:11:42.872 --> 00:11:45.511
I have decided to be
his girlfriend...

00:11:45.611 --> 00:11:47.381
(brightly) Mr. Zenon, sir.

00:11:47.481 --> 00:11:50.253
[Zenon] Oh, please,
you're acting like a child.

00:11:50.353 --> 00:11:52.725
You know you can't keep
running away forever.

00:11:52.825 --> 00:11:53.893
[Alexia] But I am a child.

00:11:53.994 --> 00:11:56.232
I can't understand
grownup problems.

00:11:56.332 --> 00:11:58.904
[Zenon]
It hasn't been made public yet,
but we ARE still betrothed.

00:11:59.004 --> 00:12:00.507
[Kagenou] <i>Oh I get it.
I see what's going on.</i>

00:12:00.607 --> 00:12:02.043
[Alexia] You're still only a
candidate for my betrothal.

00:12:02.143 --> 00:12:03.279
[Zenon] If you would just give
your consent,

00:12:03.379 --> 00:12:04.983
we could proceed with the
arrangement.

00:12:05.083 --> 00:12:06.553
[Kagenou] <i>For now, I'll blend
into the background</i>

00:12:06.653 --> 00:12:09.825
<i>and just ride out this main
character tier event.</i>

00:12:11.261 --> 00:12:13.399
(bell ringing)

00:12:15.269 --> 00:12:16.706
[studenst
] Want to stop by Mitsugoshi?

00:12:16.806 --> 00:12:18.342
-Ooh, yes!

00:12:18.443 --> 00:12:21.348
So basically, you don't want to
get engaged to Mr. Zenon,

00:12:21.449 --> 00:12:24.321
and you need a patsy to help
you get out of it. Am I right?

00:12:24.421 --> 00:12:26.793
That's why you chose a low
class aristocrat like me

00:12:26.893 --> 00:12:28.731
whom you could easily control.

00:12:28.831 --> 00:12:29.899
Yes, that's right.

00:12:29.999 --> 00:12:31.134
Sorry, but I don't
wanna attract

00:12:31.234 --> 00:12:32.705
any more attention than needed,

00:12:32.805 --> 00:12:34.141
and frankly,
I'm not too interested

00:12:34.241 --> 00:12:35.845
in getting mixed up
in your problems.

00:12:35.945 --> 00:12:38.316
That's pretty cold
coming from my boyfriend.

00:12:38.416 --> 00:12:40.821
In name only, you mean.

00:12:40.921 --> 00:12:42.390
As if you were any better,

(Cid growls softly)

00:12:48.369 --> 00:12:50.708
[Alexia] I had a little chat
with your friends.

00:12:50.808 --> 00:12:53.848
They turned beat red and
sang like canaries.

00:12:53.948 --> 00:12:55.316
That's not very nice.

00:12:55.416 --> 00:12:58.389
Toying with the pure heart of
an innocent young girl.

00:12:58.489 --> 00:13:00.460
If the rest of the
student body found out,

00:13:00.561 --> 00:13:03.901

(disgruntled sigh)

00:13:05.003 --> 00:13:06.272
Oh dear, are you all right?

00:13:06.372 --> 00:13:08.877
Your face seems awfully twitchy
for some reason.

00:13:08.978 --> 00:13:11.048
I'm fine.
My mouth twists like that

00:13:11.148 --> 00:13:13.587
because I'm twisted
deep down in my soul,

00:13:13.687 --> 00:13:15.490
but I'm not
as warped as you are.

00:13:15.591 --> 00:13:17.060
Did you say something, Cid?

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:18.930
Nope, I said nothing.

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:20.567
Anyway, I think I will have you

00:13:20.668 --> 00:13:22.237
keep pretending
to be my boyfriend.

00:13:22.337 --> 00:13:24.942
You can stop after
that man gives up on me.

00:13:25.042 --> 00:13:26.879
Fine. But will he ever give up?

00:13:26.979 --> 00:13:29.919
Anyone can see that I'M clearly
out of your league.

00:13:30.019 --> 00:13:31.221
I know that, of course.

00:13:31.322 --> 00:13:33.425
I just need you
to buy me some time.

00:13:33.526 --> 00:13:35.897
I will take care of
the rest of it on my own.

00:13:35.998 --> 00:13:37.935
I don't see this
ending well for us.

00:13:38.035 --> 00:13:40.741

You are so whiny.

[Cid] Really?

00:13:59.344 --> 00:14:00.781
Do I strike you as
the type of guy

00:14:00.881 --> 00:14:02.217
who can be bought with money?

00:14:02.317 --> 00:14:03.620
Yes, you do.

That man is so infuriating.

He thinks he's so great

00:15:34.034 --> 00:15:35.638
just because he can
swing a sword.

00:15:35.738 --> 00:15:37.073
Okay, okay.

Okay, okay.

[Alexia] Of course it is.

But the point of this is not
to go out for ice cream.

It's to inform the entire world
of my relationship.

00:16:20.259 --> 00:16:21.462
As a prospective husband,

00:16:21.563 --> 00:16:23.298
I think he's a pretty
prime selection.

00:16:23.398 --> 00:16:24.668
Everything is the problem.

00:16:24.768 --> 00:16:27.508
I hate everything about
his entire existence.

00:16:27.608 --> 00:16:28.677
But he is good looking.

00:16:28.777 --> 00:16:30.479
He's got status, fame,
and money.

00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:32.016
And of course he is
quite popular

00:16:32.116 --> 00:16:33.186
with all the other girls.

00:16:33.286 --> 00:16:34.589
That's just on the surface.

00:16:34.689 --> 00:16:37.260
It's really quite easy to
pretend to be perfect.

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:39.031
I mean, that's what I do.

00:16:39.131 --> 00:16:40.300
That explains it.

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:42.605
That's a very convincing
argument. (hmpf!)

00:16:42.705 --> 00:16:43.941
Did you say something?

00:16:44.041 --> 00:16:45.110
No, nothing.

00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:46.713
Anyway, I don't judge people

00:16:46.813 --> 00:16:48.516
only by what I see
on the surface.

00:16:48.617 --> 00:16:51.154
Well,
how do you judge people then?

00:16:51.255 --> 00:16:52.490
By their flaws.

00:16:52.591 --> 00:16:54.862
[Cid] Mmm, a very negative way
to judge people.

00:16:54.963 --> 00:16:56.132
Sounds like you.

00:16:56.232 --> 00:16:58.168
And that's why I've nothing
against a guy

00:16:58.269 --> 00:16:59.872
who's totally average,
full of flaws,

00:16:59.972 --> 00:17:02.009
with no redeeming qualities,
like you.

00:17:02.109 --> 00:17:04.715
Why thank you.
I'll take that as a compliment.

00:17:04.815 --> 00:17:08.155
And if I may ask, what are some
of Zenon's flaws?

00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:09.825
[Alexia] He has none.

00:17:09.925 --> 00:17:11.361
[Cid]
So he is a prime selection.

00:17:11.461 --> 00:17:14.869
Ah, no, there's no such thing
as a person with no flaws.

00:17:14.969 --> 00:17:16.438
If a person like this
did exist,

00:17:16.539 --> 00:17:19.344
they'd either be a massive liar
or completely psychotic.

00:17:19.444 --> 00:17:22.250
Oh, I see now. Thank you for
that totally arbitrary

00:17:22.350 --> 00:17:23.854
and biased response, Alexia.

00:17:23.954 --> 00:17:26.626
[Alexia] You're very welcome,
my ever so flawed puppy.

00:17:26.726 --> 00:17:27.895
Here's today's reward.

00:17:27.995 --> 00:17:29.264
(gasps)
(ka-ching)

00:17:29.364 --> 00:17:32.436
[Cid] (panting) Woof!

00:17:33.472 --> 00:17:35.042
[Kagenou]
<i>So two more weeks passed,</i>

00:17:35.142 --> 00:17:36.612
<i>and I continued to
play the boyfriend</i>

00:17:36.712 --> 00:17:39.450
<i>with no relationship progress
worth mentioning.</i>

00:17:39.552 --> 00:17:41.689
(train chugging)

00:17:46.231 --> 00:17:49.872
Your fencing is
a mystery to me.

00:17:49.972 --> 00:17:52.945
You've got the basics down,
but nothing more than that.

00:17:53.045 --> 00:17:54.582
There's absolutely
nothing else to it,

00:17:54.682 --> 00:17:57.521
but I can't take my eyes
away from it.

00:17:57.622 --> 00:17:59.191
Gee, thank you.

00:17:59.291 --> 00:18:01.663
But I still detest
watching you fight.

00:18:01.763 --> 00:18:02.865
(heavy sigh)

00:18:02.965 --> 00:18:04.268
[Cid]
What's wrong with you today?

00:18:04.368 --> 00:18:07.575
Your fencing was unusually
aggressive and sloppy.

00:18:07.675 --> 00:18:09.745
Just the ramblings
of a fake boyfriend.

00:18:09.845 --> 00:18:13.218
You really don't have to look
at me like that, you know.

00:18:16.258 --> 00:18:17.628
[Alexia] All my life,

00:18:17.728 --> 00:18:21.468
I wanted to be as good
as my sister Iris.

00:18:21.569 --> 00:18:25.309
But what I have has never been
the same as what she has.

00:18:26.044 --> 00:18:27.548
So I figured it out on my own.

00:18:27.648 --> 00:18:29.818
I tried to get stronger
in my own way,

00:18:29.918 --> 00:18:31.155
and look where it got me.

00:18:31.255 --> 00:18:32.357
What good has it done?

00:18:32.457 --> 00:18:34.628
You know what they call me,
don't you?

00:18:35.263 --> 00:18:36.766
Fencer Ordinaire.

00:18:36.866 --> 00:18:38.168
Exactly!

00:18:38.268 --> 00:18:40.941
But your fencing style is just
as ordinary as mine.

00:18:41.041 --> 00:18:43.312
Unfortunately,
for you, that is.

00:18:43.412 --> 00:18:46.184
I don't think it's
unfortunate at all.

00:18:46.284 --> 00:18:48.756
I kind of like
your fencing style.

00:18:53.332 --> 00:18:56.706
[Alexia] Someone else told me
the same thing once.

00:18:56.806 --> 00:18:58.877
At the Bushin Festival
after I'd suffered

00:18:58.977 --> 00:19:01.214
a humiliating defeat,

00:19:01.314 --> 00:19:03.185
my sister said it to me.

00:19:04.722 --> 00:19:07.026
I knew she'd never understand
what was going on in my head

00:19:07.127 --> 00:19:08.328
at that moment,

00:19:08.428 --> 00:19:11.001
and how extremely
pathetic I felt.

00:19:11.101 --> 00:19:13.806
I've hated my sword style
ever since.

00:19:15.343 --> 00:19:18.282
You should know that
I'm not a very nice person.

00:19:18.382 --> 00:19:20.053
If somewhere on the
other side of the world

00:19:20.153 --> 00:19:21.789
there was an
unfortunate incident

00:19:21.889 --> 00:19:23.092
that killed a million people,

00:19:23.192 --> 00:19:24.394
it wouldn't bother me.

00:19:24.494 --> 00:19:26.297
[Alexia] That is vile and evil.

00:19:26.397 --> 00:19:29.337
However, there are some things
that would bother me.

00:19:29.437 --> 00:19:30.974
They might be things
that other people

00:19:31.074 --> 00:19:32.979
would see as
worthless or futile,

00:19:33.079 --> 00:19:34.548
but to me these things

00:19:34.649 --> 00:19:37.287
are the most
precious things in life.

00:19:37.387 --> 00:19:41.461
That's why I said
I like your fencing style.

00:19:42.764 --> 00:19:44.367
(sword being drawn)

00:19:52.449 --> 00:19:55.857
What exactly do you mean by
telling me all of that?

00:19:55.958 --> 00:19:57.293
Nothing at all.

00:19:57.393 --> 00:19:58.797
If I did mean anything,

00:19:58.897 --> 00:20:00.700
it's just that I get
pissed off when people

00:20:00.801 --> 00:20:03.172
disrespect the things
I care about.

00:20:03.272 --> 00:20:04.709
That's just how I feel.

00:20:04.809 --> 00:20:06.946
(train brakes squealing)

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:12.389
(gasps)

00:20:14.427 --> 00:20:16.264
[Alexia] Is that so?

00:20:25.249 --> 00:20:26.852
Then goodbye, Cid.

00:20:28.957 --> 00:20:30.459
(train attendant gasps)

00:20:35.737 --> 00:20:39.310
[Kagenou]
<i>I guess this is the end of
my unwanted relationship.</i>

00:20:41.682 --> 00:20:43.820
(bright music)

00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:49.197
[Po] Come on, Cid, you have to
cheer up. Things'll get better.

00:20:49.297 --> 00:20:51.134
I know it was wrong of us to
rat you out and all,

00:20:51.234 --> 00:20:53.239
but please don't hold it
against us forever.

00:20:53.339 --> 00:20:54.241
Okay, okay.

00:20:54.341 --> 00:20:55.911
So tell us!

00:20:56.011 --> 00:20:57.547
How far did you get with her?

00:20:57.647 --> 00:20:58.348
With what?

00:20:58.448 --> 00:20:59.785
[both] Oh, come on!

00:20:59.885 --> 00:21:01.054
You know, with her!

00:21:01.154 --> 00:21:02.490
You dated her for
two whole weeks.

00:21:02.591 --> 00:21:03.760
Something must have happened.

00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:06.431
There had to be a little
something, right?

00:21:06.532 --> 00:21:08.904
(sighs) I didn't get anywhere.

00:21:09.004 --> 00:21:11.676
(gah) You know, you're just a
good for nothing loser.

00:21:11.776 --> 00:21:14.013
If it were me,
I would've gone ALL the way.

00:21:14.113 --> 00:21:17.287
[Po] I know, right? I definitely
would've at least kissed her.

00:21:17.387 --> 00:21:19.792
No, a little farther,
maybe a soft caress,

00:21:19.892 --> 00:21:22.764
or maybe something a
little more hardcore.

00:21:26.438 --> 00:21:27.974
(Skel laughing lewdly)

00:21:28.074 --> 00:21:29.578
(Po gulps)

00:21:30.346 --> 00:21:32.383
[Both] (nervous sounds)

00:21:36.258 --> 00:21:37.928
Can we have a minute?

00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:41.301
[both] Pl-please, go ahead.

00:21:41.402 --> 00:21:43.105
You should know that
Princess Alexia

00:21:43.205 --> 00:21:45.644
did not return to
her dorm last night.

00:21:45.744 --> 00:21:46.879
(soft gasp)

00:21:46.979 --> 00:21:48.950
[Zenon] The Knight Order has
been investigating it

00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:50.452
as a potential kidnapping.

00:21:50.553 --> 00:21:52.825
And as the last person to have
been in contact with her,

00:21:52.925 --> 00:21:54.595
you're now a suspect.

00:21:54.695 --> 00:21:57.233
I would like to ask you
a few questions.

00:21:57.333 --> 00:22:00.405
I assume you're willing
to cooperate?

00:22:00.507 --> 00:22:02.844
(dramtic music)

00:22:06.284 --> 00:22:07.954
(both nervous)

00:22:11.662 --> 00:22:14.601
[Kagenou] <i>And that's when I
realized something:</i>

00:22:15.369 --> 00:22:18.108
<i>I am in big trouble.</i>

00:22:20.547 --> 00:22:22.884
(ENDING THEME)
