WEBVTT

00:00:01.837 --> 00:00:05.343
[Nelson]
Are you so stupid that you don't
know what's going on here?

00:00:05.444 --> 00:00:08.116
We're saying that if you're a
good boy and do what we say,

00:00:08.216 --> 00:00:09.352
we'll let you go!

00:00:09.452 --> 00:00:11.557
And I'm saying,
I don't need your help.

00:00:11.657 --> 00:00:12.993
You two can just watch.

00:00:13.093 --> 00:00:14.161
[Aurora] Wait!

00:00:14.261 --> 00:00:17.100
Fine then! Kill him!

00:00:18.637 --> 00:00:20.775
[blood splattering]

00:00:31.028 --> 00:00:32.799
(chuckles)

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:34.569
I got you.

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.807
(intense music)

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.679
(Aurora gasping)

00:00:41.116 --> 00:00:43.186
(inhales)
(music stops abruptly)

00:00:43.754 --> 00:00:44.889
(chomp)

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.327
(intense music)

00:00:49.398 --> 00:00:51.503
[Nelson] What in the...

00:00:52.872 --> 00:00:54.543
[ripping]

00:00:54.643 --> 00:00:56.780
[blood splatters]

00:00:57.849 --> 00:00:59.519
(gasps)

00:01:04.028 --> 00:01:06.365
(intense music)

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:13.246
(glass shattering)

00:01:14.783 --> 00:01:17.120
(music ends)

00:01:19.325 --> 00:01:21.195
(satisfied sigh)

00:01:21.296 --> 00:01:23.634
(OPENING THEME)

00:02:54.583 --> 00:02:55.852
[Nelson] (uncomfortable laugh)

00:02:55.952 --> 00:02:57.054
How are you alive?

00:02:57.154 --> 00:02:58.924
She stabbed you
through the gut!

00:02:59.024 --> 00:03:00.460
As long as you
protect the vitals,

00:03:00.561 --> 00:03:02.464
the human body is
surprisingly sturdy.

00:03:02.565 --> 00:03:04.168
Even if you get stabbed
through the gut,

00:03:04.268 --> 00:03:06.172
keep your arteries and
important organs safe,

00:03:06.272 --> 00:03:08.409
it won't kill you.
Pretty neat, right?

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.682
Don't you think that's just
such a beautiful thing?

00:03:10.782 --> 00:03:12.151
A beautiful thing?

00:03:12.251 --> 00:03:13.687
[Nelson] What are you...
[Cid] Yes!

00:03:13.787 --> 00:03:15.490
[Cid] You just protect your
vitals and it saves you

00:03:15.591 --> 00:03:17.529
all the trouble of dodging
your enemy's attack.

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:19.398
Then, once you've been impaled
through the belly,

00:03:19.498 --> 00:03:21.068
you can bite right into
the other guy's neck.

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:24.108
You're in position for a nearly
inescapable counterattack.

00:03:24.208 --> 00:03:27.214
You know, I'm not so sure that
you have all of your marbles.

00:03:27.314 --> 00:03:28.984
[Cid] So now what?
[Nelson] Huh?

00:03:29.084 --> 00:03:30.320
[Cid] Your elf buddy is gone.

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.258
Is it safe to assume
I'll be fighting you next?

00:03:32.358 --> 00:03:36.066
[Nelson] Wait!
I give in! I was wrong!

00:03:36.166 --> 00:03:38.036
I'm sorry, all right?

00:03:38.136 --> 00:03:39.673
Let's all just calm down here

00:03:39.773 --> 00:03:41.510
and we can talk it out!
(electrical discharge)

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.585
Bet that's what you thought
I'd say, isn't it?

00:03:45.685 --> 00:03:48.624
[Nelson]
I admit, I was a bit surprised
to see Olivier defeated

00:03:48.724 --> 00:03:51.195
by some punk kid
who can't use his magic.

00:03:51.295 --> 00:03:52.632
You were probably just lucky,

00:03:52.732 --> 00:03:55.236
but nevertheless,
a win is a win.

00:03:55.337 --> 00:03:57.340
Congratulations!

00:03:57.441 --> 00:03:59.111
Thank you! Yay!

00:03:59.211 --> 00:04:00.447
(growling)

00:04:00.548 --> 00:04:03.252
Listen, all you did was beat
one inferior copy,

00:04:03.352 --> 00:04:05.958
so don't pat yourself on the
back too hard just yet!

00:04:06.058 --> 00:04:09.599
There is so much magical energy
lying dormant in the Sanctuary

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:11.636
that not even we can fathom it!

00:04:11.736 --> 00:04:14.943
That means we can EVEN DO THIS!

00:04:15.043 --> 00:04:17.615
(electrical discharge)
(intense orchestra music)

00:04:21.723 --> 00:04:24.996
[Aurora] (gasp) This can't be.

00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:31.776
[Nelson] This is the
power of the SANCTUARY!

00:04:33.079 --> 00:04:35.818
A resurrected superhuman army?

00:04:37.054 --> 00:04:38.957
Sorry.
(music stops abruptly)

00:04:39.058 --> 00:04:40.294
Your time's up.

00:04:40.394 --> 00:04:42.732
(electrical discharge)

00:04:50.815 --> 00:04:52.952
(glass shattering)

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:55.624
(gasping)

00:04:56.526 --> 00:04:59.465
What? How did you achieve that?

00:04:59.566 --> 00:05:02.204
A solid mass of magical energy?
(choral music)

00:05:02.304 --> 00:05:03.541
An artifact?

00:05:03.641 --> 00:05:06.312
No, don't tell me it's slime?!

00:05:06.412 --> 00:05:10.688
But how is it possible?
How can you use magic?

00:05:10.788 --> 00:05:12.825
If using magic
gets it absorbed,

00:05:12.926 --> 00:05:15.731
then I just have to temper the
magic until it's too solid.

00:05:15.831 --> 00:05:19.873
It took a bit of time,
but it's really quite simple.

00:05:20.474 --> 00:05:22.144
It's simple?

00:05:22.244 --> 00:05:25.685
But that's just not possible
for a normal human being!

00:05:25.785 --> 00:05:30.026
Olivier! Kill him!
Kill him now!

00:05:30.126 --> 00:05:32.330
[Cid] Your moves are even
more tedious than before.

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.301
It's like fighting
a bunch of scarecrows!

00:05:34.401 --> 00:05:36.974
Yes, yes! Just like that!
Kill him! Kill him!

00:05:37.074 --> 00:05:39.411
I guess playtime is over then.

00:05:39.513 --> 00:05:41.550
So, you said we
draw the holy sword,

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:42.952
cut the chains,
(Aurora gasps)

00:05:43.052 --> 00:05:44.823
and destroy the magical core.

00:05:44.923 --> 00:05:46.827
Is that right?

00:05:46.927 --> 00:05:49.131
[Aurora] Um, yes.

00:05:49.231 --> 00:05:50.701
Wait,
you're not really going to-

00:05:50.802 --> 00:05:53.373
[Cid] It's such a pain to go
through each individual step.

00:05:53.473 --> 00:05:56.212
We could just blast through
all of them at once.

00:05:56.312 --> 00:05:57.548
Same result, right?

00:05:57.648 --> 00:05:59.986
(intense orchestra music)

00:06:01.723 --> 00:06:03.025
(whaaa)

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.504
(gasps)

00:06:08.604 --> 00:06:12.010
How could he ever be
allowed this much power?

00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:16.051
[Cid] I...

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:18.122
am...

00:06:19.492 --> 00:06:22.198
the All-Range...

00:06:22.298 --> 00:06:24.636
(music stops abruptly)

00:06:29.378 --> 00:06:30.582
Atomic.

00:06:30.682 --> 00:06:33.052
(blood splattering)
(elecrical discharge)

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:37.628
(explosion)

00:06:42.404 --> 00:06:45.143
(ground rumbling)

00:06:45.243 --> 00:06:47.581
(water splashing)

00:06:49.986 --> 00:06:52.123
(explosion)

00:06:53.594 --> 00:06:55.931
(water surging)

00:07:21.517 --> 00:07:23.887
(mysterious music)
(wind blowing)

00:07:35.545 --> 00:07:37.882
(chains rattling)

00:07:46.733 --> 00:07:49.071
(birds chirping)
(leaves rustling)

00:08:04.869 --> 00:08:07.908
[Aurora]
You even survived being
stabbed through the heart.

00:08:08.008 --> 00:08:11.316
Oh, I used magic to pull my
heart over to the side.

00:08:11.416 --> 00:08:13.486
And now I'm extremely tired.

00:08:13.587 --> 00:08:15.891
You're just full of surprises.

00:08:16.694 --> 00:08:18.597
I'm nowhere near as...

00:08:18.697 --> 00:08:19.966
(Aurora gasps)

00:08:20.066 --> 00:08:21.536
(sighs)

00:08:22.538 --> 00:08:24.207
You're disappearing.

00:08:26.045 --> 00:08:27.715
It appears so.

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:34.028
[Aurora] I am the one who
called you here.

00:08:34.128 --> 00:08:36.332
I'm sorry for lying to you.
(gentle music)

00:08:36.432 --> 00:08:38.871
[Cid] That's okay.

00:08:38.971 --> 00:08:40.975
[Aurora] That's not the only
thing I lied about.

00:08:41.075 --> 00:08:42.778
[Cid] That's okay.

00:08:42.878 --> 00:08:47.254
For so long, all I wanted was
to disappear into nothing.

00:08:47.354 --> 00:08:49.692
I wanted to forget everything.

00:08:52.498 --> 00:08:57.609
But now, I've made one memory
that I don't want to forget.

00:08:57.709 --> 00:08:59.579
Even if I do disappear,

00:08:59.679 --> 00:09:02.651
I want to hold on
to this experience.

00:09:04.388 --> 00:09:06.225
It's truly a precious memory.

00:09:06.326 --> 00:09:08.329
Thank you, Cid.

00:09:08.429 --> 00:09:10.033
I had a good time, too.

00:09:10.133 --> 00:09:11.369
Thank you.

00:09:11.469 --> 00:09:13.807
(sad violin music)

00:09:18.116 --> 00:09:22.591
Remember, if you were to ever
stumble upon the real me...

00:09:23.359 --> 00:09:24.663
Please...

00:09:24.763 --> 00:09:27.100
(sad orchestra music)

00:09:36.218 --> 00:09:38.355
(music trails out)

00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:47.474
(birds chirping)

00:09:47.575 --> 00:09:49.077
"Please"?

00:10:00.634 --> 00:10:02.638
What we saw back there...

00:10:02.738 --> 00:10:05.611
I'm guessing that it
must've been Shadow's...

00:10:08.349 --> 00:10:09.852
[Rose] Alexia?

00:10:10.721 --> 00:10:12.592
Doesn't it just kill you?

00:10:12.692 --> 00:10:14.194
What do you mean?

00:10:16.098 --> 00:10:19.204
[Alexia]
We couldn't do anything.

00:10:19.304 --> 00:10:22.377
I thought I had accepted the
fact that I'm powerless,

00:10:22.477 --> 00:10:24.481
but there's more
to it than that.

00:10:24.582 --> 00:10:26.720
Who was right and
who was wrong?

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:28.891
I couldn't even judge
between good and evil.

00:10:28.991 --> 00:10:31.930
All I could do was stand there
as a helpless spectator.

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:33.800
If I never learn anything else,

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:35.971
then I'm going to lose all the
things I care about

00:10:36.072 --> 00:10:38.342
before I even know
they're in danger.

00:10:38.442 --> 00:10:40.246
That's the feeling I get.

00:10:41.583 --> 00:10:43.987
I've been doing a little
thinking as well.

00:10:44.088 --> 00:10:45.792
Ever since the Academy
was attacked,

00:10:45.892 --> 00:10:48.196
I've felt there must be
huge organizations

00:10:48.296 --> 00:10:49.733
working in the shadows.

00:10:49.833 --> 00:10:51.402
But we don't know anything,

00:10:51.503 --> 00:10:53.005
not about Shadow Garden

00:10:53.105 --> 00:10:55.243
or about the organization
they're at war with.

00:10:55.343 --> 00:10:57.615
Then Princess Alexia,
what do you think?

00:10:57.715 --> 00:10:59.318
I mean, do you have any ideas?

00:10:59.418 --> 00:11:01.856
Unfortunately,
we're weak and we're ignorant.

00:11:01.957 --> 00:11:03.760
But if the three of us
work together,

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:05.396
we should be able
to do something.

00:11:05.496 --> 00:11:08.135
After all, I'm the princess
of the Midgar Kingdom,

00:11:08.235 --> 00:11:10.741
and Rose is the princess
of the Oriana Kingdom,

00:11:10.841 --> 00:11:12.845
and Natsume Kafka,
as an author,

00:11:12.945 --> 00:11:15.383
surely you have a network of
connections you can use.

00:11:15.484 --> 00:11:18.289
We'll work together to gather
all the information we can.

00:11:18.389 --> 00:11:21.763
[Natsume] And what will you do
with the information we find?

00:11:21.863 --> 00:11:23.232
That depends on what it is.

00:11:23.332 --> 00:11:26.271
But I'm thinking maybe the
three of us can join forces.

00:11:26.371 --> 00:11:30.146
Then we can recruit allies
and establish an HQ.

00:11:30.247 --> 00:11:31.482
Would that work?

00:11:31.583 --> 00:11:32.918
(sighs)

00:11:33.721 --> 00:11:35.825
Not even a shred
of a solid plan.

00:11:35.925 --> 00:11:38.229
Well, I said we'll gather
information first!

00:11:38.329 --> 00:11:40.901
We'll analyze it and
THEN make a decision!

00:11:41.001 --> 00:11:43.874
That would be nice,
IF you could analyze anything.

00:11:43.974 --> 00:11:45.644
What did you just say to me?

00:11:45.744 --> 00:11:47.816
Oh, nevermind.

00:11:47.916 --> 00:11:49.351
[Alexia] So what do you say?

00:11:49.451 --> 00:11:51.690
Are you with me, or aren't you?

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:53.026
Yes, I'll join you.

00:11:53.126 --> 00:11:54.261
I don't have much to offer,

00:11:54.361 --> 00:11:56.132
but I still do have
a bit of influence.

00:11:56.232 --> 00:11:59.873
I'm in, too. I'll use my writing
connections to do some research.

00:11:59.973 --> 00:12:02.779
(inspiring piano music)

00:12:02.879 --> 00:12:05.483
That settles it, then.

00:12:05.584 --> 00:12:07.555
We can now call
ourselves a team.

00:12:07.655 --> 00:12:10.527
Even if one of us is from a
different kingdom and
social standing

00:12:10.627 --> 00:12:12.899
and there's no telling what's
going on in her heart,

00:12:12.999 --> 00:12:15.237
I choose to believe
we're on the same side.

00:12:15.337 --> 00:12:17.975
Joining forces to expose
the truth of the world.

00:12:18.075 --> 00:12:20.046
It's like we're in the
beginning of a legend.

00:12:20.146 --> 00:12:22.551
We have the hero, the wise
woman, and the deadweight,

00:12:22.651 --> 00:12:24.789
all present and accounted for.
(giggles)

00:12:24.889 --> 00:12:27.493
You're calling YOURSELF
the deadweight, right?

00:12:34.174 --> 00:12:36.680
[Epsilon] The Sanctuary
has been obliterated.

00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:37.815
[Alpha] Yes.

00:12:37.915 --> 00:12:39.719
Has the holy sword
been recovered?

00:12:39.819 --> 00:12:41.790
[Epsilon]
The holy sword was vaporized.

00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:44.394
Any samples from
the magical core?

00:12:44.494 --> 00:12:46.498
[Epsilon] Also vaporized.

00:12:46.599 --> 00:12:48.169
In this particular situation,

00:12:48.269 --> 00:12:50.574
it was the easiest way
to handle things.

00:12:50.674 --> 00:12:51.943
That's so like him.

00:12:52.043 --> 00:12:53.980
After all, Lord Shadow
is the only one

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:56.218
who could have accomplished it.

00:12:56.318 --> 00:13:00.528
The path that he treads upon is
the path that we walk as well.

00:13:00.628 --> 00:13:01.763
And what of Beta?

00:13:01.863 --> 00:13:03.634
[Epsilon]
She is guiding the princesses.

00:13:03.734 --> 00:13:04.903
If she plays her cards right,

00:13:05.003 --> 00:13:06.840
she'll infiltrate
their inner circles.

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:08.142
[Alpha] Then it's going well.

00:13:08.243 --> 00:13:11.315
[Epsilon] Yes.
Now the other matter.

00:13:11.415 --> 00:13:12.417
[Alpha] Go on.

00:13:12.518 --> 00:13:14.154
[Epsilon] It appears our
theory was correct.

00:13:14.254 --> 00:13:17.995
Aurora, the Witch of Calamity,
has another name:

00:13:18.095 --> 00:13:19.698
The Demon Diablos.

00:13:19.799 --> 00:13:21.301
(ominous music)

00:13:21.401 --> 00:13:22.470
[Alpha] I see.

00:13:22.571 --> 00:13:24.341
So that's why he...

00:13:24.441 --> 00:13:27.749
[Alpha]
Our next performance will be
the Royal Capital of Midgar.

00:13:27.849 --> 00:13:29.084
Make sure to be ready.

00:13:29.184 --> 00:13:31.723
[Epsilon] Yes.
Shall I report to Lord Shadow?

00:13:31.823 --> 00:13:34.461
[Alpha]
No need. He knows everything.

00:13:34.562 --> 00:13:36.899
(mysterious music)

00:13:43.847 --> 00:13:47.220
(rain falling steadily)

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:50.561
[Rude] I personally recommend
this property, Ms. Luna.

00:13:50.661 --> 00:13:52.263
It faces out onto
the main road,

00:13:52.364 --> 00:13:55.504
it gets plenty of sunlight,
and it boasts a wide frontage.

00:13:55.604 --> 00:13:58.309
Including the land,
it's worth 140 million zeni,

00:13:58.409 --> 00:14:00.379
but I'll give you
a special discounted rate

00:14:00.479 --> 00:14:01.883
of only 120 million.

00:14:01.983 --> 00:14:04.956
We would very much love
to have Mitsugoshi, Ltd.

00:14:05.056 --> 00:14:08.228
open a second store
here in the Velgalta Empire.

00:14:08.329 --> 00:14:09.464
I can see that.

00:14:09.565 --> 00:14:11.703
But we have to consider the
reconstruction projects

00:14:11.803 --> 00:14:13.606
in the Sacred Land
after that disaster.

00:14:13.706 --> 00:14:17.949
But look at it! Prime property
for only 120 million!

00:14:18.049 --> 00:14:19.719
Oh yes, prime property.

00:14:19.819 --> 00:14:22.892
Still on the market despite its
exceptionally low price.

00:14:22.992 --> 00:14:26.165
B-but can't you see that's
only in the short-term?

00:14:26.265 --> 00:14:28.804
All we need is for a place
like Mitsugoshi to open

00:14:28.904 --> 00:14:30.807
and the city of Madlid
will thrive!

00:14:30.907 --> 00:14:34.949
Even I've heard about
Mitsugoshi in the Velgalta
Imperial Capital,

00:14:35.049 --> 00:14:37.821
and my humble domain is out
in the middle of nowhere!

00:14:37.922 --> 00:14:40.059
We need a Mitsugoshi
here in Madlid!

00:14:40.159 --> 00:14:43.366
Our future depends on it!
I'll make it 100 million zeni!

00:14:43.466 --> 00:14:45.570
And I'll throw in priority
use of the warehouses

00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:47.340
and temporary reduction
measures on all taxes.

00:14:47.441 --> 00:14:49.244
The survey has been completed.
(Rude continues sales pitch)

00:14:49.344 --> 00:14:51.314
[Gamma] Conclusion?
[Nu] It will work.

00:14:51.415 --> 00:14:53.921
-And the liquid?
-No doubt about it.

00:14:54.021 --> 00:14:56.258
[Nu] It's petroleum.
(Rude continues sales pitch)

00:14:56.358 --> 00:14:58.095
(giggles)

00:14:58.195 --> 00:14:59.532
So I humbly beg you!

00:14:59.632 --> 00:15:00.967
Please turn our poor slum-

00:15:01.067 --> 00:15:02.471
I-I mean, our shopping district-

00:15:02.572 --> 00:15:04.073
[Gamma] I'll take it.

00:15:04.609 --> 00:15:05.944
Uh, come again?

00:15:06.044 --> 00:15:07.682
Our company is prepared to buy

00:15:07.782 --> 00:15:10.019
every single property
on this street.

00:15:10.119 --> 00:15:13.059
[Rude]
I'm sorry, what did you say?

00:15:13.159 --> 00:15:15.063
If you are willing
to accept our terms,

00:15:15.163 --> 00:15:16.599
then we will
redevelop this city

00:15:16.699 --> 00:15:20.072
and make it the most magnificent
city in all of Velgalta.

00:15:20.172 --> 00:15:21.509
That is what I said.

00:15:21.609 --> 00:15:22.879
Are you willing to expand

00:15:22.979 --> 00:15:25.416
the Nyle River's tributaries
and build a canal?

00:15:25.517 --> 00:15:27.855
I want you to buy up every
notable piece of property

00:15:27.955 --> 00:15:29.391
along the Nyle River.

00:15:29.491 --> 00:15:30.426
[girl] Right away.

00:15:30.527 --> 00:15:31.830
Everyone, get ready.

00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:34.434
It's time for the
real estate bubble.

00:15:35.571 --> 00:15:38.142
(wind howling)

00:15:38.242 --> 00:15:40.580
(penguins squeaking)

00:15:41.917 --> 00:15:44.254
(light buzzing)

00:15:45.991 --> 00:15:48.095
[Beta] That reminds me.
Where's Delta?

00:15:48.195 --> 00:15:50.366
[Chi] She hasn't come back yet.

00:15:50.466 --> 00:15:52.771
[Beta] Do you think she's
still at the Sacred Land?

00:15:52.871 --> 00:15:55.209
(howling)

00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:58.248
[Omega] Should we send
someone to get her?

00:15:58.349 --> 00:15:59.752
[Epsilon]
I wouldn't worry about it.

00:15:59.852 --> 00:16:02.056
She'll be back
when it gets cold.

00:16:04.094 --> 00:16:06.431
(bright piano music)

00:16:15.984 --> 00:16:17.253
What do you think?

00:16:17.353 --> 00:16:18.388
Um, yeah.

00:16:18.489 --> 00:16:20.728
A very familiar
architectural style,

00:16:20.828 --> 00:16:22.230
right here in another world.

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:23.901
[Alpha]
Wood frame construction.

00:16:24.001 --> 00:16:25.136
We couldn't have
done it without

00:16:25.236 --> 00:16:27.107
the building techniques
you taught us.

00:16:27.207 --> 00:16:29.010
[Cid] Is that so?

00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:31.415
[Alpha]
Our temporary base is complete.

00:16:31.516 --> 00:16:35.389
Now the girls can begin their
training in earnest.

00:16:35.489 --> 00:16:37.961
[Cid] You're really going
to train them, too?

00:16:38.061 --> 00:16:40.567
[Alpha]
Yes, it's bound to be necessary.

00:16:40.667 --> 00:16:42.672
If we're going to fight
the Cult of Diablos,

00:16:42.772 --> 00:16:45.110
we're going to need to enhance
our individual strengths

00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:47.347
as we expand our operations.

00:16:47.447 --> 00:16:48.817
Yeah, I guess you're right.

00:16:48.917 --> 00:16:50.486
That is how
the story would work.

00:16:50.587 --> 00:16:53.426
Besides, they want the power
to fight against the Cult

00:16:53.527 --> 00:16:54.562
once and for all.

00:16:54.662 --> 00:16:56.398
[Cid]
Really? Then allow me to impart

00:16:56.498 --> 00:16:58.670
a portion of my wisdom to them.

00:16:58.770 --> 00:17:01.174
I will give them the power to
stay true to their convictions

00:17:01.274 --> 00:17:03.379
in the darkest of shadows.

00:17:03.479 --> 00:17:05.550
After all,
kids living all on their own

00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:08.623
will at least need to know some
self-defense techniques.

00:17:16.673 --> 00:17:19.043
[Gamma] Lady Alpha...

00:17:19.143 --> 00:17:21.448
We received a message
from the Oriana Kingdom.

00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:24.454
They have informed us that the
Royal Chancellor Perv Asshat

00:17:24.555 --> 00:17:27.694
has set out to visit the
Royal Capital of Midgar.

00:17:27.794 --> 00:17:29.832
Chancellor Perv Asshat...

00:17:30.634 --> 00:17:32.303
So it begins.

00:17:35.376 --> 00:17:37.714
(rain falling steadily)

00:17:42.725 --> 00:17:44.127
[Iris] Then it's true.

00:17:44.227 --> 00:17:46.599
[Alexia] Yes,
we have no choice but to place

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:49.572
the entire Church of the Divine
Teachings under suspicion.

00:17:49.672 --> 00:17:52.244
The murdered archbishop,
the man who killed him

00:17:52.344 --> 00:17:54.247
and took his place
as acting archbishop...

00:17:54.347 --> 00:17:56.084
They both belonged to the Cult.

00:17:56.184 --> 00:17:58.055
But I don't know
anymore than that.

00:17:58.155 --> 00:17:59.658
The evidence has
been covered up.

00:17:59.758 --> 00:18:02.096
And we can't even find a way to
get back into the place

00:18:02.196 --> 00:18:03.800
they call the Sanctuary!

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:05.504
A facility of that
size and scale

00:18:05.604 --> 00:18:07.239
couldn't possibly
be kept hidden

00:18:07.339 --> 00:18:09.578
without considerable influence
in the public sphere.

00:18:09.678 --> 00:18:11.716
[Iris] And if we were looking
for an organization

00:18:11.816 --> 00:18:14.822
that actually has that kind
of power and influence...

00:18:14.922 --> 00:18:16.124
Forget diplomacy!

00:18:16.224 --> 00:18:17.728
We need to investigate
the Divine Teachings!

00:18:17.828 --> 00:18:20.066
If we tie this to the
incident at the capital

00:18:20.166 --> 00:18:21.368
and say we want to
find the cause,

00:18:21.468 --> 00:18:22.771
even they can't brush us-

00:18:22.871 --> 00:18:25.209
[Iris] I have suggested the
same thing to Father.

00:18:25.309 --> 00:18:27.447
I mean, His Majesty.

00:18:27.548 --> 00:18:29.752
But he always gives me
the same answer:

00:18:29.852 --> 00:18:30.921
"Don't make a move."

00:18:31.021 --> 00:18:32.123
[Alexia] What? But...

00:18:32.223 --> 00:18:33.292
[Iris]
It's what I expect from his

00:18:33.392 --> 00:18:34.795
"don't rock the boat" policies.

00:18:34.895 --> 00:18:37.267
Considering the upcoming
visit of King Oriana,

00:18:37.367 --> 00:18:39.337
ruler over one of
our allied nations,

00:18:39.437 --> 00:18:42.477
he doesn't wanna cause trouble,
especially against the Church.

00:18:42.578 --> 00:18:44.481
Doesn't want undue trouble?

00:18:44.582 --> 00:18:46.118
If we're going to
spur him to action,

00:18:46.218 --> 00:18:47.988
we'll need to find
clear evidence

00:18:48.088 --> 00:18:50.126
or show that we have
power to overcome

00:18:50.226 --> 00:18:52.665
any difficulty that
comes to the kingdom.

00:18:52.765 --> 00:18:55.269
In that sense, it's fortunate
that the Bushin Festival

00:18:55.369 --> 00:18:57.240
is being held this year.

00:18:57.340 --> 00:18:58.810
The Bushin Festival?!

00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:01.414
[Iris] The title of repeat
winner of the Bushin Festival

00:19:01.515 --> 00:19:04.487
will be the best thing to win
more backing from the
Knight Order.

00:19:04.588 --> 00:19:06.892
And if I bring our nation
the glory of victory

00:19:06.992 --> 00:19:08.262
in an international tournament,

00:19:08.362 --> 00:19:10.935
then the people's support
will be rock solid.

00:19:11.035 --> 00:19:12.136
And when that happens,

00:19:12.236 --> 00:19:14.474
His Majesty AND
his entire council

00:19:14.575 --> 00:19:17.413
will be forced to hear
what I have to say.

00:19:17.514 --> 00:19:19.985
[Alexia] But Iris,
what if Shadow Garden

00:19:20.085 --> 00:19:23.559
or the Cult of Diablos starts
plotting something again?

00:19:23.659 --> 00:19:26.131
They have been secretly
operating behind the scenes

00:19:26.231 --> 00:19:27.802
at every major event
there's been.

00:19:27.902 --> 00:19:30.039
They could be at the
Bushin Festival, too!

00:19:30.139 --> 00:19:32.109
Alexia...

00:19:32.209 --> 00:19:34.080
You have nothing to worry about.

00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:35.917
I don't care what kind of
powerful artifacts

00:19:36.018 --> 00:19:40.159
they have at their disposal.
My sword will not be defeated.

00:19:40.259 --> 00:19:41.395
Listen to me, Iris!

00:19:41.495 --> 00:19:42.999
Artifacts aren't
the only weapons

00:19:43.099 --> 00:19:44.167
they have in their arsenal!

00:19:44.267 --> 00:19:45.169
[Iris] You were there.

00:19:45.269 --> 00:19:46.338
You saw the magical light

00:19:46.438 --> 00:19:48.408
that engulfed the capital.

00:19:48.509 --> 00:19:50.713
No human being can produce
that kind of power.

00:19:50.814 --> 00:19:53.419
The only explanation is that it
was caused by an artifact

00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:55.456
housing enormous
magical energy,

00:19:55.557 --> 00:19:57.393
like what happened
at the Academy.

00:19:57.493 --> 00:19:59.932
[Alexia]
Iris, Shadow's power is...

00:20:00.032 --> 00:20:02.236
[Iris]
Besides, I saw it myself.

00:20:02.336 --> 00:20:05.442
I saw them sending an
artifact out of control.

00:20:05.944 --> 00:20:08.549
Yes, I saw it.

00:20:09.685 --> 00:20:10.554
(growls)

00:20:10.654 --> 00:20:12.758
Iris, hear what I'm saying.

00:20:12.858 --> 00:20:15.496
[Iris] Either way,
I cannot run from this.

00:20:15.597 --> 00:20:17.868
If they appear at
the Bushin Festival,

00:20:17.968 --> 00:20:19.471
we merely have to defeat them.

00:20:19.572 --> 00:20:22.845
Not just the Cult,
but also Shadow Garden.

00:20:22.945 --> 00:20:24.548
(Alexia sighs)

00:20:24.648 --> 00:20:26.719
Oh, by the way, Alexia,
might I ask you

00:20:26.819 --> 00:20:29.625
why you went after them
at the Sacred Land?
[Alexia] (gasps)

00:20:29.725 --> 00:20:32.230
I only authorized you
to audit the archbishop.

00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:33.733
You were to do nothing else.

00:20:33.833 --> 00:20:36.404
When did I tell you to follow
a suspicious organization

00:20:36.506 --> 00:20:38.609
and barge into
mysterious locations?

00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:41.816
W-well, I didn't exactly follow
them because I wanted to.

00:20:41.916 --> 00:20:43.218
Please understand, I...

00:20:43.318 --> 00:20:45.356
You see, it was an
emergency evacuation,

00:20:45.456 --> 00:20:48.128
or perhaps
willful negligence...

00:20:48.228 --> 00:20:49.965
Oops! I think I'm
getting lightheaded!

00:20:50.065 --> 00:20:51.969
I'm off to the cold water bath!

00:20:52.671 --> 00:20:53.973
(door shuts)

00:20:55.075 --> 00:20:56.345
(sighs)

00:20:56.445 --> 00:20:58.616
My Crimson Knights lost their
strongest members

00:20:58.716 --> 00:21:00.419
so soon after they
were organized,

00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:02.456
and I see no hope
of rebuilding.

00:21:02.557 --> 00:21:04.294
The Knight Order used to
give me their support,

00:21:04.394 --> 00:21:06.665
but even they are
skeptical of me now.

00:21:07.568 --> 00:21:09.337
I insisted on taking
their best knights

00:21:09.437 --> 00:21:11.308
and I just let them die.

00:21:11.408 --> 00:21:13.178
Of course they hate me.

00:21:13.278 --> 00:21:15.383
I have to win the tournament.

00:21:15.483 --> 00:21:18.322
I'll show them my power
and cut open a path.

00:21:18.422 --> 00:21:21.061
It's my only choice.
Like before...

00:21:21.161 --> 00:21:22.531
(snap)

00:21:22.631 --> 00:21:24.100
(gasp)

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:25.703
Huh?

00:21:26.138 --> 00:21:27.641
(snap)

00:21:28.208 --> 00:21:30.212
Hmm?

00:21:30.312 --> 00:21:32.651
(rain falling steadily)

00:21:45.142 --> 00:21:46.812
(deep breath)

00:21:50.954 --> 00:21:52.357
No...

00:21:52.457 --> 00:21:54.493
His fencing that day...

00:21:55.731 --> 00:21:57.934
That beautiful fencing, I...

00:22:03.445 --> 00:22:05.382
(single heartbeat)
(gasps)

00:22:05.951 --> 00:22:07.453
(gasp)

00:22:16.204 --> 00:22:18.543
(rain continues falling)

00:22:21.181 --> 00:22:23.519
(ENDING THEME)
