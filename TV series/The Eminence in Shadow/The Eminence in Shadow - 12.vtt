WEBVTT

00:00:01.202 --> 00:00:03.507
(wind blowing)

00:00:08.718 --> 00:00:11.524
Everyone in the stadium will be
talking only about Shadow,

00:00:11.624 --> 00:00:12.893
the mysterious Eminence.

00:00:12.993 --> 00:00:16.567
They will have forgotten all
about Background Character Cid.

00:00:16.667 --> 00:00:17.869
I worked hard today.

00:00:17.969 --> 00:00:20.407
Think I'll go soak
in the hot spring.
(energy building)

00:00:20.775 --> 00:00:22.277
Hmm?

00:00:23.213 --> 00:00:25.117
(ominous music)

00:00:25.217 --> 00:00:26.486
What is this?

00:00:26.587 --> 00:00:28.089
A giant door?

00:00:28.758 --> 00:00:30.260
Hmm...

00:00:37.041 --> 00:00:39.378
(ominous music builds)

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:46.459
(sighs)
(energy building)

00:00:46.927 --> 00:00:47.996
Hmm?

00:00:48.096 --> 00:00:50.100
Oh, come on.

00:00:50.467 --> 00:00:52.304
Hmm...

00:00:52.404 --> 00:00:54.743
(ominous music continues)

00:01:05.565 --> 00:01:06.834
(smug chuckle)

00:01:06.934 --> 00:01:08.704
(energy building)

00:01:08.804 --> 00:01:10.541
This isn't what they mean
when they talk about

00:01:10.641 --> 00:01:12.513
a door that can go anywhere,
is it?

00:01:12.613 --> 00:01:14.481
I get the feeling that I
couldn't ignore it

00:01:14.583 --> 00:01:16.085
if I wanted to.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:17.822
Hmm...

00:01:21.263 --> 00:01:22.999
Well, fine then.

00:01:23.099 --> 00:01:25.437
Let's just get this over with.

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.156
(OPENING THEME)

00:03:08.877 --> 00:03:10.480
(spectators chattering)
(ominous music)

00:03:10.581 --> 00:03:12.351
[man] I've never seen
anything like it.

00:03:12.451 --> 00:03:13.921
What in the world?

00:03:14.021 --> 00:03:15.792
Wait, is that a giant door?

00:03:15.892 --> 00:03:18.229
[Rose]
Do you think a new warrior's
going to come out of it?

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:21.637
[Alexia]
We already saw that witch.
What would be next, the demon?

00:03:21.737 --> 00:03:24.208
[Nelson] Impossible!
Does this mean the Sanctuary

00:03:24.308 --> 00:03:26.146
actually responded to Shadow?

00:03:26.246 --> 00:03:27.515
[Rose] Archbishop?

00:03:27.615 --> 00:03:28.317
Huh?

00:03:28.417 --> 00:03:30.053
What do you mean responded?

00:03:30.153 --> 00:03:32.525
Oh, just, well,
as you know, of course,

00:03:32.625 --> 00:03:34.128
today is the one day of the year

00:03:34.228 --> 00:03:35.865
that the door to
the Sanctuary is opened.

00:03:35.965 --> 00:03:39.372
However, a door appearing
like this in the middle
of the trial...

00:03:39.472 --> 00:03:42.044
This type of thing has
never happened before.

00:03:42.144 --> 00:03:43.848
I heard that the
door to the Sanctuary

00:03:43.948 --> 00:03:46.353
was actually hidden
inside the cathedral.

00:03:46.453 --> 00:03:48.222
[Nelson] The word "door"
doesn't refer only

00:03:48.322 --> 00:03:50.829
to the one door with a
physical manifestation.

00:03:50.929 --> 00:03:54.401
As you can see, it changes
shape and location at will,

00:03:54.502 --> 00:03:56.573
taking on the most
appropriate form

00:03:56.673 --> 00:03:58.243
to respond to those who seek it

00:03:58.343 --> 00:04:00.614
and those who are worthy
to pass through it.

00:04:00.714 --> 00:04:03.320
There is a Forbidding Door,
a Beckoning Door,

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:04.623
and a Welcoming Door.

00:04:04.723 --> 00:04:07.194
I don't know which door
we're seeing now.

00:04:07.294 --> 00:04:09.298
Wait a minute,
the door is opening!

00:04:09.398 --> 00:04:11.035
Get the congregation outside!

00:04:11.135 --> 00:04:13.139
Don't let anyone
near that door!

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:16.012
[staff] The Goddess' Trial
has been canceled.

00:04:16.112 --> 00:04:17.347
Please exit quickly.

00:04:17.448 --> 00:04:19.652
(general hubub)

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:24.629
Now ladies, we don't want to
risk putting you in any danger.

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:26.232
So let's exit the stadium and-

00:04:26.332 --> 00:04:28.571
Huh?!
What in the world?

00:04:28.671 --> 00:04:30.808
[Natsume]
Oh, dear, dear, dear, dear!

00:04:30.908 --> 00:04:32.344
[Nelson] Oh, uh...

00:04:32.444 --> 00:04:34.048
(tense music)

00:04:34.148 --> 00:04:37.354
[Nelson] You? It can't be!

00:04:37.454 --> 00:04:39.391
Shadow Garden?

00:04:39.826 --> 00:04:41.128
(yawns)

00:04:41.228 --> 00:04:42.397
My apologies.

00:04:42.498 --> 00:04:44.268
But I ask that you
behave yourselves

00:04:44.368 --> 00:04:47.742
until the door is closed,
Your Highnesses.

00:04:49.513 --> 00:04:50.715
It's all up to you now.

00:04:50.815 --> 00:04:54.556
[Epsilon]
Yes, I understand, Lady Alpha.

00:04:54.656 --> 00:04:56.893
[Nelson] When did you...

00:04:56.993 --> 00:04:58.697
(Nelson spluttering)

00:04:59.231 --> 00:05:00.300
Come, Delta.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.903
Yes, Your Ladyship, sir.

00:05:06.412 --> 00:05:07.682
[Alexia] <i>So that's Alpha.</i>

00:05:07.782 --> 00:05:11.355
<i>She's strong,
stronger than Iris.</i>

00:05:14.797 --> 00:05:16.933
(dramatic music)

00:05:21.108 --> 00:05:22.344
[Alexia] They vanished!

00:05:22.444 --> 00:05:24.716
Hold it right there!
Keep out of our Sanctuary.

00:05:24.816 --> 00:05:27.053
[Rose] What are you people
trying to do?

00:05:28.122 --> 00:05:30.126
All we want is for you to be
good little girls,

00:05:30.226 --> 00:05:33.366
and stay right here until the
door is completely closed.

00:05:33.466 --> 00:05:35.771
However, we will be
taking Baldy with us.

00:05:35.871 --> 00:05:38.911
What could you possibly
be planning to do
in the Sanctuary?

00:05:39.011 --> 00:05:40.681
[Epsilon]
It's not about what we do there.

00:05:40.781 --> 00:05:42.818
It's about what we find there.

00:05:43.687 --> 00:05:45.356
[Epsilon] Nobody move.
(both gasp)

00:05:45.456 --> 00:05:46.627
If you take one more step,

00:05:46.727 --> 00:05:48.931
who can say what will happen
to this woman?

00:05:49.031 --> 00:05:50.801
(screams)

00:05:50.901 --> 00:05:52.237
Miss Natsume!

00:05:52.337 --> 00:05:53.574
We could just let her die.

00:05:53.674 --> 00:05:55.276
No, we can't do that!

00:05:55.377 --> 00:05:56.981
[Natsume]
Don't worry, I'll be fine.

00:05:57.081 --> 00:05:58.283
[Alexia] Not buying the act.

00:05:58.383 --> 00:06:00.855
[Epsilon] I totally
understand how you feel.

00:06:00.955 --> 00:06:01.890
[Rose] Miss Natsume!

00:06:01.991 --> 00:06:04.529
[Epsilon]
So anyone can go through,

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:05.899
but it won't stay open forever.

00:06:05.999 --> 00:06:08.269
[Rose] Miss Natsume!
[Alexia] Let's let her die.

00:06:08.369 --> 00:06:09.672
[Epsilon] We are going inside.

00:06:09.773 --> 00:06:12.144
Come on, baldy.
Bring the woman too.

00:06:12.244 --> 00:06:13.781
(grrr) I'm not going anywhere,

00:06:13.881 --> 00:06:16.954
so you can go without me
to the afterlife!

00:06:17.054 --> 00:06:18.557
Hmm?!

00:06:21.362 --> 00:06:24.434
[Nelson]
Executioner Venom, kill her!

00:06:26.038 --> 00:06:27.541
(gasps)

00:06:29.245 --> 00:06:31.583
(dramatic tense music)

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:37.127
[Cid] Do you want power?

00:06:39.465 --> 00:06:42.838
[Epsilon] I WILL claim
victory over nature!

00:06:49.285 --> 00:06:51.322
I refuse to be exposed!

00:06:51.422 --> 00:06:54.127
Not here, not now!

00:06:55.364 --> 00:06:58.470
(tense brooding music)

00:06:58.571 --> 00:07:00.875
[Nelson]
Huh? What happened? What the?

00:07:00.975 --> 00:07:02.845
Venom!
Venom, what are you doing?

00:07:02.945 --> 00:07:04.014
Just kill her!

00:07:04.114 --> 00:07:05.951
(blood splattering)

00:07:06.554 --> 00:07:08.222
[Epsilon] Did you see?

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:11.195
Did you see ANYTHING?

00:07:11.295 --> 00:07:14.135
No, I didn't! I swear
I didn't see a single thing.

00:07:14.235 --> 00:07:15.638
I mean, what- (whaaa)

00:07:15.738 --> 00:07:17.608
[Epsilon] Come on, Baldy.

00:07:19.178 --> 00:07:20.681
(sighs)

00:07:22.451 --> 00:07:23.820
What would he have
seen in there?

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:26.726
It all happened so quickly,
in the blink of an eye.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.298
Oh, no!

00:07:29.398 --> 00:07:31.870
[Alexia] Hey, stop!
[Rose] Miss Natsume!

00:07:32.538 --> 00:07:33.641
(gasps)

00:07:33.741 --> 00:07:36.145
[Alexia] The door!
[Rose] It's closing!

00:07:37.849 --> 00:07:39.451
[Shadow] Stay out of it.

00:07:39.552 --> 00:07:41.022
No, I refuse!

00:07:41.122 --> 00:07:43.259
Wait, Alexia!

00:07:44.896 --> 00:07:46.432
(gasp)

00:07:46.533 --> 00:07:48.870
Okay, here I come!

00:07:52.144 --> 00:07:54.481
(quiet descends)

00:07:56.085 --> 00:07:58.222
(electrical discharge)

00:08:00.494 --> 00:08:03.166
(both screaming)

00:08:03.266 --> 00:08:05.103
(large thuds)

00:08:07.007 --> 00:08:10.548
Well, that hurt a little.
Is everyone all right?

00:08:10.648 --> 00:08:12.652
[Alexia]
My dear, Rose, please move now.

00:08:12.752 --> 00:08:15.123
Princess Alexia,
I would ask that you please

00:08:15.223 --> 00:08:16.693
not grope my breast.

00:08:16.793 --> 00:08:19.699
I'm not touching this jiggly
sack of meat for fun, okay?

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:22.470
Oh, I see now!
You ARE jealous of me.

00:08:22.571 --> 00:08:24.776
[Rose] Ladies, let's not fight.

00:08:25.276 --> 00:08:26.780
[all] Huh?

00:08:28.416 --> 00:08:29.786
[Rose] Uh...

00:08:29.886 --> 00:08:31.523
Um, uh...

00:08:31.623 --> 00:08:33.159
[Alexia] I'm very sorry.
[Natsume] Ouch...

00:08:33.259 --> 00:08:36.165
I tripped and fell, then there
was a door right in front of me

00:08:36.265 --> 00:08:38.269
and I couldn't stop myself.

00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:43.079
Fine, do whatever you like.

00:08:43.179 --> 00:08:45.918
It may be that you should
learn this as well.

00:08:48.356 --> 00:08:49.859
[Natsume] Huh?

00:08:49.959 --> 00:08:51.629
(sighs)

00:08:57.006 --> 00:08:59.111
[Alexia] This is the Sanctuary?

00:08:59.211 --> 00:09:00.346
[Alpha] According to legend,

00:09:00.446 --> 00:09:01.850
this is the place
where they sealed away

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:04.021
the left arm of
the Demon Diablos

00:09:04.121 --> 00:09:06.358
after he was defeated
by the Hero Olivier.

00:09:06.458 --> 00:09:08.129
[Nelson]
So this is what it's all about?

00:09:08.229 --> 00:09:09.365
You heard a fairy tale,

00:09:09.465 --> 00:09:11.135
so you're coming here
to find the arm?

00:09:11.235 --> 00:09:12.337
[Alpha] That sounds fun too.

00:09:12.438 --> 00:09:13.807
But we're more
interested in learning

00:09:13.907 --> 00:09:15.177
about the Cult of Diablos.

00:09:15.277 --> 00:09:17.313
[Nelson] What?
What are you talking about?

00:09:17.413 --> 00:09:19.753
[Alpha] I know that you can't
answer our questions.

00:09:19.853 --> 00:09:21.957
That's why we came to
see it for ourselves.

00:09:22.057 --> 00:09:24.094
We're here to find everything
from the beginning.

00:09:24.194 --> 00:09:27.735
The truth that was buried in
the dark corners of history.

00:09:28.937 --> 00:09:32.779
The statue of the
Great Hero Olivier...

00:09:32.879 --> 00:09:36.118
[Rose] I thought the
Great Hero Olivier was a man.

00:09:37.588 --> 00:09:39.992
We have a general grasp
of all of the facts.

00:09:40.092 --> 00:09:42.998
We know the true history,
the Cult's real objective,

00:09:43.099 --> 00:09:48.910
and we know why this hero has
the exact same face as mine.

00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:51.550
You're a possessed elf,
but you weren't compatible.

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:54.154
You should be dead.
Why are you still alive?

00:09:54.254 --> 00:09:55.891
So you do know about us.

00:09:55.992 --> 00:09:58.730
We are well aware of the truth
about the possessed, Bishop.

00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:00.367
We must be quite the
nuisance to a Church

00:10:00.467 --> 00:10:03.339
that's so eager to maintain
the current way of things.

00:10:03.439 --> 00:10:04.508
(Nelson stuttering)

00:10:04.609 --> 00:10:06.546
What on earth are
you talking about?

00:10:06.646 --> 00:10:08.583
[Alpha] We also suspect
that the Cult's goal

00:10:08.683 --> 00:10:11.221
is not merely to bring the
demon back to life,

00:10:11.321 --> 00:10:13.192
but we aren't yet certain.

00:10:13.292 --> 00:10:17.201
So why don't we just all
go see for ourselves?

00:10:17.301 --> 00:10:20.107
(tense ominous music)

00:10:20.207 --> 00:10:22.343
(electrical discharge)

00:10:22.845 --> 00:10:24.248
This can't be!

00:10:24.348 --> 00:10:26.753
There was once a great battle
in this very place

00:10:26.853 --> 00:10:29.057
and many lives were lost.

00:10:43.385 --> 00:10:45.991
[Nelson] This is impossible!
How did you turn it on?

00:10:46.091 --> 00:10:49.799
[Alpha]
The magical powers of the demon
and warriors whirled together,

00:10:49.899 --> 00:10:51.970
and that vortex
locked away the memories

00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:54.140
that had nowhere else to go.

00:10:56.078 --> 00:10:57.715
This is the final resting place

00:10:57.815 --> 00:11:00.521
of ancient memories
and demonic grudges.

00:11:00.621 --> 00:11:02.157
(both gasp)

00:11:02.257 --> 00:11:04.428
[Nelson] Olivier!

00:11:04.529 --> 00:11:05.865
Let us all now
begin our journey

00:11:05.965 --> 00:11:08.168
into the world of fairy tales.

00:11:17.621 --> 00:11:18.690
(door creaks)

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:20.861
Huh? Hi there!

00:11:21.629 --> 00:11:22.932
Hi there.

00:11:23.032 --> 00:11:26.171
So, you must be the one who
summoned me here then.

00:11:26.271 --> 00:11:29.011
Summoned?
I don't think I summoned you,

00:11:29.111 --> 00:11:32.752
but hey, that fight we had was
really quite enjoyable.

00:11:32.852 --> 00:11:34.522
Yeah, I had fun too.

00:11:34.623 --> 00:11:35.991
[Aurora]
My memories are incomplete,

00:11:36.091 --> 00:11:38.997
but I'm pretty sure
you were the strongest.

00:11:39.097 --> 00:11:41.670
If only you had been around
in my day and age.

00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:43.574
Thank you, I'm honored.

00:11:43.674 --> 00:11:45.845
[Aurora]
So how did you get here?

00:11:45.945 --> 00:11:47.114
There was this
door looking thing

00:11:47.214 --> 00:11:48.817
that wouldn't stop
following me around.

00:11:48.917 --> 00:11:50.822
So I gave in and
went through it.

00:11:50.922 --> 00:11:52.424
[Aurora] I don't understand.

00:11:52.525 --> 00:11:54.361
I don't either.
Oh, by the way,

00:11:54.461 --> 00:11:56.466
do you happen to know
how to get outta here?

00:11:56.567 --> 00:11:57.735
[Aurora] I'm not sure.

00:11:57.835 --> 00:12:00.073
I don't have any memories
of ever leaving.

00:12:00.173 --> 00:12:01.576
[Cid] But you just fought me.

00:12:01.676 --> 00:12:03.212
[Aurora]
I woke up and I was there.

00:12:03.312 --> 00:12:06.720
That had never happened before,
as far as I remember anyway.

00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:09.458
I see. Well, that isn't
very helpful, is it?

00:12:09.559 --> 00:12:12.665
I guess I'll start by trying
to go back the way I came.

00:12:12.765 --> 00:12:15.103
[Aurora] Excuse me.
[Cid] Huh?

00:12:15.203 --> 00:12:18.342
[Aurora] There's a beautiful
woman right in front of you.

00:12:18.442 --> 00:12:20.079
What is she wearing?

00:12:21.148 --> 00:12:22.985
[Cid] She's in a straitjacket.

00:12:23.086 --> 00:12:27.027
Then maybe you could start by
first helping her out of it?

00:12:27.127 --> 00:12:28.830
This wasn't part of training.

00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:31.969
I used to do something like
this back in the day.

00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:35.076
[Aurora] (chuckles)
How avant-garde.

00:12:35.176 --> 00:12:36.846
(schwing)

00:12:41.422 --> 00:12:42.591
Mmm...

00:12:42.692 --> 00:12:45.731
Finally free
after a thousand years.

00:12:45.831 --> 00:12:47.100
Wow, it's been that long.

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:49.438
[Aurora] I'm guessing.
I don't actually remember,

00:12:49.539 --> 00:12:51.341
but it was at least that long.

00:12:51.441 --> 00:12:54.447
Now, you and I both want
essentially the same thing.

00:12:54.548 --> 00:12:55.751
[Cid] Hmm?

00:12:55.851 --> 00:12:59.191
[Aurora] You wanna get out;
I wanna be free.

00:12:59.291 --> 00:13:00.862
Am I wrong?

00:13:00.962 --> 00:13:02.632
Well, no, I guess not.

00:13:02.732 --> 00:13:04.201
So then, let's work together.

00:13:04.301 --> 00:13:07.240
Okay, but you've never gotten
out of here before, have you?

00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:10.848
That is true, but I do know
how to free myself.

00:13:10.948 --> 00:13:13.119
This Sanctuary is
a memory prison

00:13:13.219 --> 00:13:15.489
created from ancient battles.

00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:18.597
I just have to go to its center
and destroy its magical core,

00:13:18.697 --> 00:13:20.634
and then I will be set free.

00:13:20.735 --> 00:13:21.636
Just you alone?

00:13:21.736 --> 00:13:23.205
Just me alone.

00:13:23.305 --> 00:13:25.009
Or that's what
I think will happen.

00:13:25.109 --> 00:13:26.646
But once the core is destroyed,

00:13:26.747 --> 00:13:28.249
everything around us
will disappear.

00:13:28.349 --> 00:13:30.220
You should be able
to leave then also.

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:32.658
Doesn't that mean there's
no more Sanctuary?

00:13:32.758 --> 00:13:34.896
[Aurora]
Who cares? Is that a problem?

00:13:34.996 --> 00:13:36.399
Well, I guess it's not.

00:13:36.499 --> 00:13:37.868
That settles it then.

00:13:37.968 --> 00:13:40.541
Also, and I think you've
already noticed this,

00:13:40.641 --> 00:13:42.143
but we can't use magic.

00:13:42.243 --> 00:13:44.181
We're close to the center
of the Sanctuary.

00:13:44.281 --> 00:13:45.784
You can try and
work your powers,

00:13:45.884 --> 00:13:47.588
but they'll be absorbed.

00:13:50.961 --> 00:13:52.163
So it would seem.

00:13:52.263 --> 00:13:53.968
Well,
that's not a problem for me.

00:13:54.068 --> 00:13:55.538
I'm good at breaking stuff.

00:13:55.638 --> 00:13:57.040
My, how reliable.

00:13:57.140 --> 00:13:59.879
But do know I'm just a weak,
delicate damsel in distress.

00:13:59.979 --> 00:14:03.553
I have always wanted to have a
gallant knight to protect me.
(giggles)

00:14:03.653 --> 00:14:06.291
[Cid] You don't seem all that
distressed to me, Damsel.

00:14:06.392 --> 00:14:07.928
(Aurora giggles)

00:14:08.028 --> 00:14:09.297
[Cid]
Now that I'm thinking of it,

00:14:09.397 --> 00:14:11.669
what will you do
once you're free?

00:14:11.769 --> 00:14:13.973
[Aurora]
I'll vanish into nothing.

00:14:16.947 --> 00:14:19.284
(glass shattering)

00:14:23.192 --> 00:14:24.896
[Rose] What is this place?

00:14:24.996 --> 00:14:26.767
[Alpha] The memories of
the Hero Olivier

00:14:26.867 --> 00:14:29.572
that had been locked up
in the Sanctuary.

00:14:29.672 --> 00:14:33.947
Long ago, the Cult gathered
orphaned children to this place

00:14:34.047 --> 00:14:36.686
and used them as guinea pigs
in their experiments.

00:14:36.786 --> 00:14:39.525
Most of the children's bodies
rejected the treatments

00:14:39.625 --> 00:14:40.828
and they died.

00:14:40.928 --> 00:14:44.201
Only a small handful
of girls survived.

00:14:44.301 --> 00:14:46.471
Then they are the possessed.

00:14:46.573 --> 00:14:48.242
That's horrific.

00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:58.128
[Cid] Where are we?

00:14:58.228 --> 00:14:59.899
[Aurora] Inside a memory.

00:14:59.999 --> 00:15:01.502
Your memory?

00:15:02.237 --> 00:15:04.240
[Aurora] I do recognize it.

00:15:06.211 --> 00:15:07.514
Hmm?

00:15:08.517 --> 00:15:10.186
(girl sniffles)

00:15:10.286 --> 00:15:12.323
[Cid] I think she's crying.

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:19.071
She looks just like you.

00:15:19.171 --> 00:15:20.641
[Aurora] Just a coincidence.

00:15:20.741 --> 00:15:23.078
So why do you think
she's crying?

00:15:23.178 --> 00:15:25.183
She probably wet the bed.

00:15:25.283 --> 00:15:27.420
[Cid]
Anyway, what are we going to do?

00:15:27.521 --> 00:15:29.024
[Aurora]
If we wanna move forward,

00:15:29.124 --> 00:15:31.461
then all we have to do
is end this memory.

00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:33.432
[Cid] Meaning?

00:15:35.002 --> 00:15:37.541
[Aurora]
Crying won't change anything.

00:15:39.745 --> 00:15:41.414
(smack)

00:15:45.991 --> 00:15:47.194
Man, that was harsh.

00:15:47.294 --> 00:15:49.732
It's fine.
She's me anyway.

00:15:49.832 --> 00:15:51.536
So you're admitting she's you.

00:15:51.636 --> 00:15:53.973
(glass shattering)

00:16:02.691 --> 00:16:06.298
[Alpha]
Olivier was one of the few
children who were compatible.

00:16:07.033 --> 00:16:08.937
[Alexia] Compatible with what?

00:16:09.037 --> 00:16:10.707
The Diablos' cells.

00:16:10.807 --> 00:16:13.279
That is what we
call them you see.

00:16:13.379 --> 00:16:15.249
[Alpha] The Cult was
performing experiments

00:16:15.349 --> 00:16:17.320
to implant demon cells
in children.

00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:19.792
(growls)
There was no other choice.

00:16:19.892 --> 00:16:22.698
If we were going to fight the
demon, we needed power.

00:16:22.799 --> 00:16:23.834
We had to do it!

00:16:23.934 --> 00:16:26.104
That's the Cult's
excuse anyway.

00:16:26.205 --> 00:16:27.741
Whatever their real
intentions were,

00:16:27.841 --> 00:16:31.248
the fact remains that Olivier
did sever the demon's left arm.

00:16:31.348 --> 00:16:33.620
[Rose] Are you saying it's not
just a fairy tale?

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:35.958
[Alpha] You're welcome to
think whatever you like.

00:16:36.058 --> 00:16:38.262
Even the things we're seeing
right now,

00:16:38.362 --> 00:16:40.700
we still don't know
how much of it is true.

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:43.973
Memories fade and are
replaced with new ones.

00:16:44.073 --> 00:16:46.746
In any case,
once Olivier had matured and

00:16:46.846 --> 00:16:50.353
gained the power of Diablos,
she was given a mission.

00:16:50.453 --> 00:16:52.825
[Alexia]
To vanquish the demon, right?

00:16:52.925 --> 00:16:55.496
[Alpha] In the fairy tale,
that is what became her quest.

00:16:55.597 --> 00:16:57.968
But in reality,
the mission assigned to her

00:16:58.068 --> 00:17:00.340
was to extract
new cells from Diablos.

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:02.812
Stop making up nonsense!
(waaah)

00:17:02.912 --> 00:17:06.686
[Alpha]
She remained obedient even after
she had obtained her powers.

00:17:06.786 --> 00:17:09.157
She believed that if she had
completed her task,

00:17:09.258 --> 00:17:12.164
it would lead to a world where
people could live in peace.

00:17:12.264 --> 00:17:14.902
But the cult had a
different goal in mind.

00:17:15.002 --> 00:17:17.306
(glass shattering)

00:17:19.946 --> 00:17:21.782
[Alexia] A battlefield?

00:17:25.089 --> 00:17:27.160
[Alpha] No matter how many
parts she cut off,

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:29.230
the demon still lived.

00:17:32.136 --> 00:17:34.508
(men groaning)
(blood splattering)

00:17:37.614 --> 00:17:40.019
The Cult used powerful
ancient artifacts

00:17:40.119 --> 00:17:41.890
to immobilize the left arm.

00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:46.064
They cut into its flesh, drew
its blood, and researched it.

00:17:46.165 --> 00:17:48.069
All to gain the
marvelous life force

00:17:48.169 --> 00:17:50.807
contained within
Diablos' cells.

00:17:50.907 --> 00:17:53.111
This is what they created.

00:17:53.211 --> 00:17:54.114
Those are-

00:17:54.214 --> 00:17:55.416
(Nelson cringing)

00:17:55.517 --> 00:17:57.988
[Alpha] But the side effects
are too strong.

00:17:58.088 --> 00:18:00.527
This is not what the
Cult truly sought.

00:18:02.731 --> 00:18:04.868
(glass shattering)

00:18:11.214 --> 00:18:12.785
Is that the demon's arm?

00:18:12.885 --> 00:18:14.054
A relic!

00:18:14.154 --> 00:18:15.858
That thing is enormous.

00:18:15.958 --> 00:18:17.694
Th-that's impossible!

00:18:17.794 --> 00:18:19.799
How dare you?!
Why would you expose this

00:18:19.899 --> 00:18:21.903
here in front of them?

00:18:22.003 --> 00:18:23.673
Stop, don't look!

00:18:23.773 --> 00:18:26.478
You're the lowlife descendant
of a guinea pig.

00:18:26.579 --> 00:18:28.416
You have no right to
know these things.

00:18:28.517 --> 00:18:30.554
[Alpha] It was said that with
its crimson sheen,

00:18:30.654 --> 00:18:33.492
it looked just like
the blood of Diablos.

00:18:36.165 --> 00:18:38.904
A single taste of it would
grant tremendous power

00:18:39.004 --> 00:18:41.074
and a body that
never grows old.

00:18:41.174 --> 00:18:43.747
You mean they'd gain
ageless immortality?

00:18:43.847 --> 00:18:46.652
So you're saying that's what
the Cult is really after?

00:18:46.753 --> 00:18:47.888
(Alpha chuckles)

00:18:47.988 --> 00:18:50.292
Look at our dear
Priest Nelson...

00:18:51.595 --> 00:18:53.466
(groaning)

00:18:53.567 --> 00:18:55.904
...and that man over there.

00:18:56.004 --> 00:18:58.142
Do you notice a
striking resemblance?

00:18:58.242 --> 00:18:59.477
(both gasp)

00:18:59.578 --> 00:19:01.415
You were there.
I would expect you would have

00:19:01.516 --> 00:19:04.822
some fascinating stories
to share with us.

00:19:04.922 --> 00:19:06.491
What is the name of this drug?

00:19:06.592 --> 00:19:08.129
(groaning)

00:19:08.229 --> 00:19:09.498
Fine!

00:19:09.599 --> 00:19:13.740
If you must know it's "Beads,"
Beads of Diablos.

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:16.111
[Alpha] Thank you,
but there was a problem.

00:19:16.211 --> 00:19:18.983
This drug had two major flaws.

00:19:19.083 --> 00:19:20.654
Flaws you say, what kind?

00:19:20.754 --> 00:19:23.325
Oh, please, one look at him
will tell you.

00:19:23.425 --> 00:19:25.630
Past Nelson had hair...

00:19:26.766 --> 00:19:29.137
but in the present...

00:19:29.237 --> 00:19:31.407
That's not it! It's not!

00:19:31.509 --> 00:19:33.412
I lost my hair
from all the pressure!

00:19:33.513 --> 00:19:34.982
I was surrounded by idiots

00:19:35.083 --> 00:19:36.484
who figured since
I wasn't gonna die

00:19:36.586 --> 00:19:38.188
they could make me do
all the work.

00:19:38.288 --> 00:19:40.126
Normally, they were at
each other's throats,

00:19:40.226 --> 00:19:42.130
but somehow those bastards
worked together

00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:45.202
when it came to making me
clean up the mess.

00:19:45.302 --> 00:19:46.740
I'm sorry, I guess I was wrong.

00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:49.110
The first flaw is that the
Beads of Diablos

00:19:49.210 --> 00:19:51.181
must be taken
at regular intervals

00:19:51.281 --> 00:19:53.285
or the effects will wear off.

00:19:53.385 --> 00:19:55.623
I would guess
about once a year.

00:19:56.391 --> 00:19:57.994
[Nelson] Your guest is right.

00:19:58.094 --> 00:20:00.166
[Alpha] The second is that
they can only be produced

00:20:00.266 --> 00:20:02.269
in very small amounts.

00:20:03.038 --> 00:20:05.109
In one year?

00:20:05.209 --> 00:20:07.046
[Nelson] We can make twelve.

00:20:07.146 --> 00:20:08.382
Come to think of it, I believe

00:20:08.482 --> 00:20:10.419
the highest ranking
organization in the Cult,

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:12.991
the Knights of Rounds,
contains twelve members.

00:20:13.091 --> 00:20:14.160
A coincidence?

00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:17.133
[Alexia]
(gasps) Knights of Rounds?

00:20:17.233 --> 00:20:19.370
So if I'm correct,
after all this time,

00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:21.709
you have yet to perfect
the Beads of Diablos,

00:20:21.809 --> 00:20:24.181
and you assume the keys
to your perfect drug

00:20:24.281 --> 00:20:26.018
are the immobilized
demon's limb

00:20:26.118 --> 00:20:27.855
and the heroes' descendants.

00:20:27.955 --> 00:20:29.558
That's right, people like me,

00:20:29.658 --> 00:20:32.363
the girl with Olivier's blood
running through her veins.

00:20:32.463 --> 00:20:35.269
Am I right,
Sir Eleventh of the Rounds?

00:20:35.369 --> 00:20:37.373
(growls)

00:20:38.141 --> 00:20:39.344
(chuckles)

00:20:39.444 --> 00:20:41.281
[Nelson]
Every single member of the Cult

00:20:41.381 --> 00:20:43.252
wants the power and
eternal life

00:20:43.352 --> 00:20:44.989
you can gain from those beads.

00:20:45.089 --> 00:20:49.331
And indeed, I am one of
the chosen Knights of Rounds:

00:20:49.431 --> 00:20:52.470
Nelson the Avaricious!

00:20:52.571 --> 00:20:54.942
(groans)
(blood splatters)

00:21:04.194 --> 00:21:06.397
(water splashes)

00:21:09.337 --> 00:21:10.439
(statisfied chuckle)

00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:12.577
Delta,
we told you not to kill him

00:21:12.677 --> 00:21:15.617
until we got all the information
we needed from him.

00:21:15.717 --> 00:21:16.852
(gasps)

00:21:16.952 --> 00:21:18.523
(whimpers)

00:21:18.623 --> 00:21:20.994
I'm so sorry, Lady Alpha.

00:21:21.094 --> 00:21:23.465
But I thought it would be
better if I hunted him.

00:21:23.567 --> 00:21:25.036
I hunted boars
in the mountains and-

00:21:25.136 --> 00:21:27.039
That's enough of that.

00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:28.510
(rueful whimper)

00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:31.481
[Alpha] And remember what
I'm constantly telling you:

00:21:31.582 --> 00:21:35.055
Always make sure that
your prey is actually dead.

00:21:36.125 --> 00:21:38.796
(evil laughter)

00:21:38.896 --> 00:21:41.034
(glass cracks)

00:21:43.138 --> 00:21:44.775
(glass shattering)

00:21:47.881 --> 00:21:48.950
(clang)

00:21:49.051 --> 00:21:50.554
It's all white.

00:21:50.654 --> 00:21:52.691
What the hell is happening?

00:21:53.626 --> 00:21:56.064
I don't see
Epsilon or the others.

00:21:56.832 --> 00:21:58.670
[Epsilon] We've been separated.

00:21:58.770 --> 00:22:00.172
This must be another feature

00:22:00.272 --> 00:22:01.942
of the Sanctuary's
security system.

00:22:02.043 --> 00:22:04.380
(dramatic music)

00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:06.585
(Nelson laughs)

00:22:06.685 --> 00:22:09.992
Don't you see?
The Sanctuary is OUR territory.

00:22:10.092 --> 00:22:13.198
You will rue the day you
turned against the Cult.

00:22:13.298 --> 00:22:16.337
Now feel our wrath!

00:22:18.075 --> 00:22:19.745
(raaah)

00:22:21.247 --> 00:22:23.586
(ENDING THEME)
